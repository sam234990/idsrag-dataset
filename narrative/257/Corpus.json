{"ori_id":"3b8b81b1451f953bfb01844ddd98542956290829","title":"Robur the Conqueror","context":"Robur the Conqueror\n The story begins with strange lights and sounds, including blaring trumpet music, reported in the skies all over the world. The events are capped by the mysterious appearance of black flags with gold suns atop tall historic landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty in New York, the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, and the Eiffel Tower in Paris. These events are all the work of the mysterious Robur (the specific epithet for English Oak, Quercus robur, and figuratively taken to mean \"strength\"), a brilliant inventor who intrudes on a meeting of a flight-enthusiast's club called the Weldon Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nMembers of the Weldon Institute are all firm believers that mankind shall master the skies using \"lighter than air\" craft, and that \"heavier than air\" craft such as airplanes and helicopters would be unfeasible. The institute has been constructing a giant dirigible called the Go-ahead, and are having a heated discussion of where to place its propeller (in front to pull it, or behind to push it) when Robur appears at the meeting and is admitted to speak to them. He chastises the group for being balloon-boosters when \"heavier than air\" flying apparatuses are the future. When asked if Robur himself has \"made conquest of the air,\" he states that he has, leading to him accepting the title \"Robur the Conqueror\". During his short time at the Weldon Institute, Robur so incites the members that they chase him outside. Just as they are about to attack him, Robur appears to vanish into the mob, but he has actually been borne away by a flying machine.\nLater that night Robur kidnaps the Weldon Institute's secretary, president, and the president's valet. He takes them on board his ship, a huge, battery-powered, multirotor gyrodyne called the Albatross, which has many vertical airscrews to provide lift, and two horizontal airscrews in a push-pull configuration to drive the vessel forward. It bears the same black flag with golden sun that has been sighted on so many landmarks, and the music in the sky is explained to be one of the crewmen playing a trumpet. To demonstrate the vessel's superiority, Robur takes his captives around the world in the course of three weeks. The president and secretary are angry at Robur for kidnapping them and unwilling to admit that the Albatross is a fantastic vessel, or that their notions of \"lighter than air\" superiority are wrong. They demand that Robur release them, but he is aloof and always says that they shall remain as long as he desires it. Fearing they will be held captive forever, the two formulate plans to both escape and destroy the Albatross.\nAfter the horizontal propellers are damaged in a storm, the Albatross is anchored over the Chatham Islands for repairs. While the crew is busy at work, the two Weldon Institute members light a fuse and make their escape. They try to bring the valet with them but cannot find him, only later discovering that he had already escaped without them. The Albatross explodes and its wreckage, along with Robur and his crew, plunge into the ocean. Meanwhile, the three escapees are safe on a small but inhabited island and are later rescued by a ship, then make a long journey back to Philadelphia.\nThe Weldon Institute members return, and rather than describe their adventures or admit that Robur had created a flying machine greater than their expectations of the Go-ahead, they simply conclude the argument the group was having during their last meeting. Rather than have only one propeller to their dirigible, they decide to have one propeller in front and another behind, similar to Robur's design.\nSeven months after their return the Go-ahead is completed and making its maiden voyage with the president, secretary, and an aeronaut. The speed and maneuverability of the dirigible marvels a huge crowd, but are trivial compared to Robur's Albatross. Suddenly, out of the sky there appears the Albatross. It is revealed that when the Albatross exploded, enough of it was intact so that at least some of the propellers operated and slowed its descent, saving the crew. The crew used the remains of the Albatross as a raft until they were rescued by a ship. Later, Robur and the crew made it back to his secret X Island, where the original Albatross had been built. Robur has built a new Albatross and now intends to exact revenge by showing that it is superior to the Weldon Institute's Go-ahead.\nThe entirety of the final scene is described from the crowd's point of view. The Albatross begins circling the Go-ahead; the Go-ahead drops ballast and rises to fourteen thousand feet. The Albatross follows, still a circling menace. The Go-ahead is at the mercy of the Albatross because the Albatross is both faster and more maneuverable. Finally, the Go-ahead exceeds her pressure height, where her gas bags rupture. Losing her buoyancy gas, the Go-ahead drops out of the sky like a rapidly descending kite. The Albatross stays alongside of the Go-ahead as she falls, signalling the pilot and passengers of the Go-ahead to come on board the Albatross. They refuse, but then the crew of the Albatross again seizes them and brings them aboard.\nHaving demonstrated his rule over the skies, Robur returns the three men to the ground. In a short speech, Robur says that nations are not yet fit for union. He cautions the crowd that it is evolution, not revolution, that they should be seeking. He leaves with the promise that he will one day return to reveal his secrets of flight. The people of Philadelphia subject Prudent and Evans to unrelenting ridicule for the rest of their lives.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Robur the Conqueror, by Jules Verne\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Bang!\n\nThe pistol shots were almost simultaneous. A cow peacefully grazing\nfifty yards away received one of the bullets in her back. She had\nnothing to do with the quarrel all the same.\n\nNeither of the adversaries was hit.\n\nWho were these two gentlemen? We do not know, although this would be\nan excellent opportunity to hand down their names to posterity. All\nwe can say is that the elder was an Englishman and the younger an\nAmerican, and both of them were old enough to know better.\n\nSo far as recording in what locality the inoffensive ruminant had\njust tasted her last tuft of herbage, nothing can be easier. It was\non the left bank of Niagara, not far from the suspension bridge which\njoins the American to the Canadian bank three miles from the falls.\n\nThe Englishman stepped up to the American.\n\n\"I contend, nevertheless, that it was 'Rule Britannia!'\"\n\n\"And I say it was 'Yankee Doodle!'\" replied the young American.\n\nThe dispute was about to begin again when one of the\nseconds--doubtless in the interests of the milk trade--interposed.\n\n\"Suppose we say it was 'Rule Doodle' and 'Yankee Britannia' and\nadjourn to breakfast?\"\n\nThis compromise between the national airs of Great Britain and the\nUnited States was adopted to the general satisfaction. The Americans\nand Englishmen walked up the left bank of the Niagara on their way to\nGoat Island, the neutral ground between the falls. Let us leave them\nin the presence of the boiled eggs and traditional ham, and floods\nenough of tea to make the cataract jealous, and trouble ourselves no\nmore about them. It is extremely unlikely that we shall again meet\nwith them in this story.\n\nWhich was right; the Englishman or the American? It is not easy to\nsay. Anyhow the duel shows how great was the excitement, not only in\nthe new but also in the old world, with regard to an inexplicable\nphenomenon which for a month or more had driven everybody to\ndistraction.\n\nNever had the sky been so much looked at since the appearance of man\non the terrestrial globe. The night before an aerial trumpet had\nblared its brazen notes through space immediately over that part of\nCanada between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. Some people had heard\nthose notes as \"Yankee Doodle,\" others had heard them as \"Rule\nBritannia,\" and hence the quarrel between the Anglo-Saxons, which\nended with the breakfast on Goat Island. Perhaps it was neither one\nnor the other of these patriotic tunes, but what was undoubted by all\nwas that these extraordinary sounds had seemed to descend from the\nsky to the earth.\n\nWhat could it be? Was it some exuberant aeronaut rejoicing on that\nsonorous instrument of which the Renomm\u00c3\u00a9e makes such obstreperous use?\n\nNo! There was no balloon and there were no aeronauts. Some strange\nphenomenon had occurred in the higher zones of the atmosphere, a\nphenomenon of which neither the nature nor the cause could be\nexplained. Today it appeared over America; forty-eight hours\nafterwards it was over Europe; a week later it was in Asia over the\nCelestial Empire.\n\nHence in every country of the world--empire, kingdom, or republic--there\nwas anxiety which it was important to allay. If you hear in\nyour house strange and inexplicable noises, do you not at once\nendeavor to discover the cause? And if your search is in vain, do you\nnot leave your house and take up your quarters in another? But in\nthis case the house was the terrestrial globe! There are no means of\nleaving that house for the moon or Mars, or Venus, or Jupiter, or\nany other planet of the solar system. And so of necessity we have to\nfind out what it is that takes place, not in the infinite void, but\nwithin the atmospherical zones. In fact, if there is no air there is\nno noise, and as there was a noise--that famous trumpet, to wit--the\nphenomenon must occur in the air, the density of which invariably\ndiminishes, and which does not extend for more than six miles round\nour spheroid.\n\nNaturally the newspapers took up the question in their thousands, and\ntreated it in every form, throwing on it both light and darkness,\nrecording many things about it true or false, alarming and\ntranquillizing their readers--as the sale required--and almost\ndriving ordinary people mad. At one blow party politics dropped\nunheeded--and the affairs of the world went on none the worse for it.\n\nBut what could this thing be? There was not an observatory that was\nnot applied to. If an observatory could not give a satisfactory\nanswer what was the use of observatories? If astronomers, who doubled\nand tripled the stars a hundred thousand million miles away, could\nnot explain a phenomenon occurring only a few miles off, what was the\nuse of astronomers?\n\nThe observatory at Paris was very guarded in what it said. In the\nmathematical section they had not thought the statement worth\nnoticing; in the meridional section they knew nothing about it; in\nthe physical observatory they had not come across it; in the geodetic\nsection they had had no observation; in the meteorological section\nthere had been no record; in the calculating room they had had\nnothing to deal with. At any rate this confession was a frank one,\nand the same frankness characterized the replies from the observatory\nof Montsouris and the magnetic station in the park of St. Maur. The\nsame respect for the truth distinguished the Bureau des Longitudes.\n\nThe provinces were slightly more affirmative. Perhaps in the night of\nthe fifth and the morning of the sixth of May there had appeared a\nflash of light of electrical origin which lasted about twenty\nseconds. At the Pic du Midi this light appeared between nine and ten\nin the evening. At the Meteorological Observatory on the Puy de Dome\nthe light had been observed between one and two o'clock in the\nmorning; at Mont Ventoux in Provence it had been seen between two and\nthree o'clock; at Nice it had been noticed between three and four\no'clock; while at the Semnoz Alps between Annecy, Le Bourget, and Le\nL\u00c3\u00a9man, it had been detected just as the zenith was paling with the\ndawn.\n\nNow it evidently would not do to disregard these observations\naltogether. There could be no doubt that a light had been observed at\ndifferent places, in succession, at intervals, during some hours.\nHence, whether it had been produced from many centers in the\nterrestrial atmosphere, or from one center, it was plain that the\nlight must have traveled at a speed of over one hundred and twenty\nmiles an hour.\n\nIn the United Kingdom there was much perplexity. The observatories\nwere not in agreement. Greenwich would not consent to the proposition\nof Oxford. They were agreed on one point, however, and that was: \"It\nwas nothing at all!\"\n\nBut, said one, \"It was an optical illusion!\" While the other\ncontended that, \"It was an acoustical illusion!\" And so they\ndisputed. Something, however, was, it will be seen, common to both\n\"It was an illusion.\"\n\nBetween the observatory of Berlin and the observatory of Vienna the\ndiscussion threatened to end in international complications; but\nRussia, in the person of the director of the observatory at Pulkowa,\nshowed that both were right. It all depended on the point of view\nfrom which they attacked the phenomenon, which, though impossible in\ntheory, was possible in practice.\n\nIn Switzerland, at the observatory of Sautis in the canton of\nAppenzell, at the Righi, at the G\u00c3\u00a4briss, in the passes of the\nSt. Gothard, at the St. Bernard, at the Julier, at the Simplon, at\nZurich, at Somblick in the Tyrolean Alps, there was a very strong\ndisinclination to say anything about what nobody could prove--and\nthat was nothing but reasonable.\n\nBut in Italy, at the meteorological stations on Vesuvius, on Etna in\nthe old Casa Inglesi, at Monte Cavo, the observers made no hesitation\nin admitting the materiality of the phenomenon, particularly as they\nhad seen it by day in the form of a small cloud of vapor, and by\nnight in that of a shooting star. But of what it was they knew\nnothing.\n\nScientists began at last to tire of the mystery, while they continued\nto disagree about it, and even to frighten the lowly and the\nignorant, who, thanks to one of the wisest laws of nature, have\nformed, form, and will form the immense majority of the world's\ninhabitants. Astronomers and meteorologists would soon have dropped\nthe subject altogether had not, on the night of the 26th and 27th,\nthe observatory of Kautokeino at Finmark, in Norway, and during the\nnight of the 28th and 29th that of Isfjord at Spitzbergen--Norwegian\none and Swedish the other--found themselves agreed in recording that\nin the center of an aurora borealis there had appeared a sort of huge\nbird, an aerial monster, whose structure they were unable to\ndetermine, but who, there was no doubt, was showering off from his\nbody certain corpuscles which exploded like bombs.\n\nIn Europe not a doubt was thrown on this observation of the stations\nin Finmark and Spitzbergen. But what appeared the most phenomenal\nabout it was that the Swedes and Norwegians could find themselves in\nagreement on any subject whatever.\n\nThere was a laugh at the asserted discovery in all the observatories\nof South America, in Brazil, Peru, and La Plata, and in those of\nAustralia at Sydney, Adelaide, and Melbourne; and Australian laughter\nis very catching.\n\nTo sum up, only one chief of a meteorological station ventured on a\ndecided answer to this question, notwithstanding the sarcasms that\nhis solution provoked. This was a Chinaman, the director of the\nobservatory at Zi-Ka-Wey which rises in the center of a vast plateau\nless than thirty miles from the sea, having an immense horizon and\nwonderfully pure atmosphere. \"It is possible,\" said he, \"that the\nobject was an aviform apparatus--a flying machine!\"\n\nWhat nonsense!\n\nBut if the controversy was keen in the old world, we can imagine what\nit was like in that portion of the new of which the United States\noccupy so vast an area.\n\nA Yankee, we know, does not waste time on the road. He takes the\nstreet that leads him straight to his end. And the observatories of\nthe American Federation did not hesitate to do their best. If they\ndid not hurl their objectives at each other's heads, it was because\nthey would have had to put them back just when they most wanted to\nuse them. In this much-disputed question the observatories of\nWashington in the District of Columbia, and Cambridge in\nMassachusetts, found themselves opposed by those of Dartmouth College\nin New Hampshire, and Ann Arbor in Michigan. The subject of their\ndispute was not the nature of the body observed, but the precise\nmoment of its observation. All of them claimed to have seen it the\nsame night, the same hour, the same minute, the same second, although\nthe trajectory of the mysterious voyager took it but a moderate\nheight above the horizon. Now from Massachusetts to Michigan, from\nNew Hampshire to Columbia, the distance is too great for this double\nobservation, made at the same moment, to be considered possible.\n\nDudley at Albany, in the state of New York, and West Point, the\nmilitary academy, showed that their colleagues were wrong by an\nelaborate calculation of the right ascension and declination of the\naforesaid body.\n\nBut later on it was discovered that the observers had been deceived\nin the body, and that what they had seen was an aerolite. This\naerolite could not be the object in question, for how could an\naerolite blow a trumpet?\n\nIt was in vain that they tried to get rid of this trumpet as an\noptical illusion. The ears were no more deceived than the eyes.\nSomething had assuredly been seen, and something had assuredly been\nheard. In the night of the 12th and 13th of May--a very dark night--the\nobservers at Yale College, in the Sheffield Science School, had\nbeen able to take down a few bars of a musical phrase in D major,\ncommon time, which gave note for note, rhythm for rhythm, the chorus\nof the Chant du D\u00c3\u00a9part.\n\n\"Good,\" said the Yankee wags. \"There is a French band well up in the\nair.\"\n\n\"But to joke is not to answer.\" Thus said the observatory at Boston,\nfounded by the Atlantic Iron Works Society, whose opinions in matters\nof astronomy and meteorology began to have much weight in the world\nof science.\n\nThen there intervened the observatory at Cincinnati, founded in 1870,\non Mount Lookout, thanks to the generosity of Mr. Kilgour, and known\nfor its micrometrical measurements of double stars. Its director\ndeclared with the utmost good faith that there had certainly been\nsomething, that a traveling body had shown itself at very short\nperiods at different points in the atmosphere, but what were the\nnature of this body, its dimensions, its speed, and its trajectory,\nit was impossible to say.\n\nIt was then a journal whose publicity is immense--the \"New York\nHerald\"--received the anonymous contribution hereunder.\n\n\"There will be in the recollection of most people the rivalry which\nexisted a few years ago between the two heirs of the Begum of\nRagginahra, the French doctor Sarrasin, the city of Frankville, and\nthe German engineer Schultze, in the city of Steeltown, both in the\nsouth of Oregon in the United States.\n\n\"It will not have been forgotten that, with the object of destroying\nFrankville, Herr Schultze launched a formidable engine, intended to\nbeat down the town and annihilate it at a single blow.\n\n\"Still less will it be forgotten that this engine, whose initial\nvelocity as it left the mouth of the monster cannon had been\nerroneously calculated, had flown off at a speed exceeding by sixteen\ntimes that of ordinary projectiles--or about four hundred and fifty\nmiles an hour--that it did not fall to the ground, and that it\npassed into an aerolitic stage, so as to circle for ever round our globe.\n\n\"Why should not this be the body in question?\"\n\nVery ingenious, Mr. Correspondent on the \"New York Herald!\" but how\nabout the trumpet? There was no trumpet in Herr Schulze's projectile!\n\nSo all the explanations explained nothing, and all the observers had\nobserved in vain. There remained only the suggestion offered by the\ndirector of Zi-Ka-Wey. But the opinion of a Chinaman!\n\nThe discussion continued, and there was no sign of agreement. Then\ncame a short period of rest. Some days elapsed without any object,\naerolite or otherwise, being described, and without any trumpet notes\nbeing heard in the atmosphere. The body then had fallen on some part\nof the globe where it had been difficult to trace it; in the sea,\nperhaps. Had it sunk in the depths of the Atlantic, the Pacific, or\nthe Indian Ocean? What was to be said in this matter?\n\nBut then, between the 2nd and 9th of June, there came a new series of\nfacts which could not possibly be explained by the unaided existence\nof a cosmic phenomenon.\n\nIn a week the Hamburgers at the top of St. Michael's Tower, the Turks\non the highest minaret of St. Sophia, the Rouennais at the end of the\nmetal spire of their cathedral, the Strasburgers at the summit of\ntheir minister, the Americans on the head of the Liberty statue at\nthe entrance of the Hudson and on the Bunker Hill monument at Boston,\nthe Chinese at the spike of the temple of the Four Hundred Genii at\nCanton, the Hindus on the sixteenth terrace of the pyramid of the\ntemple at Tanjore, the San Pietrini at the cross of St. Peter's at\nRome, the English at the cross of St. Paul's in London, the Egyptians\nat the apex of the Great Pyramid of Ghizeh, the Parisians at the\nlighting conductor of the iron tower of the Exposition of 1889, a\nthousand feet high, all of them beheld a flag floating from some one\nof these inaccessible points.\n\nAnd the flag was black, dotted with stars, and it bore a golden sun\nin its center.\n\n\n\n\nChapter II\n\nAGREEMENT IMPOSSIBLE\n\n\n\"And the first who says the contrary--\"\n\n\"Indeed! But we will say the contrary so long as there is a place to\nsay it in!\"\n\n\"And in spite of your threats--\"\n\n\"Mind what you are saying, Bat Fynn!\"\n\n\"Mind what you are saying, Uncle Prudent!\"\n\n\"I maintain that the screw ought to be behind!\"\n\n\"And so do we! And so do we!\" replied half a hundred voices\nconfounded in one.\n\n\"No! It ought to be in front!\" shouted Phil Evans.\n\n\"In front!\" roared fifty other voices, with a vigor in no whit less\nremarkable.\n\n\"We shall never agree!\"\n\n\"Never! Never!\"\n\n\"Then what is the use of a dispute?\"\n\n\"It is not a dispute! It is a discussion!\"\n\nOne would not have thought so to listen to the taunts, objurgations,\nand vociferations which filled the lecture room for a good quarter of\nan hour.\n\nThe room was one of the largest in the Weldon Institute, the\nwell-known club in Walnut Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U. S.\nA. The evening before there had been an election of a lamplighter,\noccasioning many public manifestations, noisy meetings, and even\ninterchanges of blows, resulting in an effervescence which had not\nyet subsided, and which would account for some of the excitement just\nexhibited by the members of the Weldon Institute. For this was merely\na meeting of balloonists, discussing the burning question of the\ndirection of balloons.\n\nIn this great saloon there were struggling, pushing, gesticulating,\nshouting, arguing, disputing, a hundred balloonists, all with their\nhats on, under the authority of a president, assisted by a secretary\nand treasurer. They were not engineers by profession, but simply\namateurs of all that appertained to aerostatics, and they were\namateurs in a fury, and especially foes of those who would oppose to\naerostats \"apparatuses heavier than the air,\" flying machines, aerial\nships, or what not. That these people might one day discover the\nmethod of guiding balloons is possible. There could be no doubt that\ntheir president had considerable difficulty in guiding them.\n\nThis president, well known in Philadelphia, was the famous Uncle\nPrudent, Prudent being his family name. There is nothing surprising\nin America in the qualificative uncle, for you can there be uncle\nwithout having either nephew or niece. There they speak of uncle as\nin other places they speak of father, though the father may have had\nno children.\n\nUncle Prudent was a personage of consideration, and in spite of his\nname was well known for his audacity. He was very rich, and that is\nno drawback even in the United States; and how could it be otherwise\nwhen he owned the greater part of the shares in Niagara Falls? A\nsociety of engineers had just been founded at Buffalo for working the\ncataract. It seemed to be an excellent speculation. The seven\nthousand five hundred cubic meters that pass over Niagara in a second\nwould produce seven millions of horsepower. This enormous power,\ndistributed amongst all the workshops within a radius of three\nhundred miles, would return an annual income of three hundred million\ndollars, of which the greater part would find its way into the pocket\nof Uncle Prudent. He was a bachelor, he lived quietly, and for his\nonly servant had his valet Frycollin, who was hardly worthy of being\nthe servant to so audacious a master.\n\nUncle Prudent was rich, and therefore he had friends, as was natural;\nbut he also had enemies, although he was president of the club--among\nothers all those who envied his position. Amongst his bitterest\nfoes we may mention the secretary of the Weldon Institute.\n\nThis was Phil Evans, who was also very rich, being the manager of the\nWheelton Watch Company, an important manufactory, which makes every\nday five hundred movements equal in every respect to the best Swiss\nworkmanship. Phil Evans would have passed for one of the happiest men\nin the world, and even in the United States, if it had not been for\nUncle Prudent. Like him he was in his forty-sixth year; like him of\ninvariable health; like him of undoubted boldness. They were two men\nmade to understand each other thoroughly, but they did not, for both\nwere of extreme violence of character. Uncle Prudent was furiously\nhot; Phil Evans was abnormally cool.\n\nAnd why had not Phil Evans been elected president of the club? The\nvotes were exactly divided between Uncle Prudent and him. Twenty\ntimes there had been a scrutiny, and twenty times the majority had\nnot declared for either one or the other. The position was\nembarrassing, and it might have lasted for the lifetime of the\ncandidates.\n\nOne of the members of the club then proposed a way out of the\ndifficulty. This was Jem Chip, the treasurer of the Weldon Institute.\nChip was a confirmed vegetarian, a proscriber of all animal\nnourishment, of all fermented liquors, half a Mussulman, half a\nBrahman. On this occasion Jem Chip was supported by another member of\nthe club, William T. Forbes, the manager of a large factory where\nthey made glucose by treating rags with sulphuric acid. A man of good\nstanding was this William T. Forbes, the father of two charming\ngirls--Miss Dorothy, called Doll, and Miss Martha, called Mat, who gave\nthe tone to the best society in Philadelphia.\n\nIt followed, then, on the proposition of Jem Chip, supported by\nWilliam T. Forbes and others, that it was decided to elect the\npresident \"on the center point.\"\n\nThis mode of election can be applied in all cases when it is desired\nto elect the most worthy; and a number of Americans of high\nintelligence are already thinking of employing it in the nomination\nof the President of the Republic of the United States.\n\nOn two boards of perfect whiteness a black line is traced. The length\nof each of these lines is mathematically the same, for they have been\ndetermined with as much accuracy as the base of the first triangle in\na trigonometrical survey. That done, the two boards were erected on\nthe same day in the center of the conference room, and the two\ncandidates, each armed with a fine needle, marched towards the board\nthat had fallen to his lot. The man who planted his needle nearest\nthe center of the line would be proclaimed President of the Weldon\nInstitute.\n\nThe operation must be done at once--no guide marks or trial shots\nallowed; nothing but sureness of eye. The man must have a compass in\nhis eye, as the saying goes; that was all.\n\nUncle Prudent stuck in his needle at the same moment as Phil Evans\ndid his. Then there began the measurement to discover which of the\ntwo competitors had most nearly approached the center.\n\nWonderful! Such had been the precision of the shots that the measures\ngave no appreciable difference. If they were not exactly in the\nmathematical center of the line, the distance between the needles was\nso small as to be invisible to the naked eye.\n\nThe meeting was much embarrassed.\n\nFortunately one of the members, Truck Milnor, insisted that the\nmeasurements should be remade by means of a rule graduated by the\nmicrometrical machine of M. Perreaux, which can divide a millimeter\ninto fifteen-hundredths of a millimeter with a diamond splinter, was\nbrought to bear on the lines; and on reading the divisions through a\nmicroscope the following were the results: Uncle Prudent had\napproached the center within less than six fifteenth-hundredths of a\nmillimeter. Phil Evans was within nine fifteen-hundredths.\n\nAnd that is why Phil Evans was only secretary of the Weldon\nInstitute, whereas Uncle Prudent was president. A difference of three\nfifteen-hundredths of a millimeter! And on account of it Phil Evans\nvowed against Uncle Prudent one of those hatreds which are none the\nless fierce for being latent.\n\n\n\n\nChapter III\n\nA VISITOR IS ANNOUNCED\n\n\nThe many experiments made during this last quarter of the nineteenth\ncentury have given considerable impetus to the question of guidable\nballoons. The cars furnished with propellers attached in 1852 to the\naerostats of the elongated form introduced by Henry Giffard, the\nmachines of Dupuy de Lome in 1872, of the Tissandier brothers in\n1883, and of Captain Krebs and Renard in 1884, yielded many important\nresults. But if these machines, moving in a medium heavier than\nthemselves, maneuvering under the propulsion of a screw, working at\nan angle to the direction of the wind, and even against the wind, to\nreturn to their point of departure, had been really \"guidable,\" they\nhad only succeeded under very favorable conditions. In large, covered\nhalls their success was perfect. In a calm atmosphere they did very\nwell. In a light wind of five or six yards a second they still moved.\nBut nothing practical had been obtained. Against a miller's wind--nine\nyards a second--the machines had remained almost stationary.\nAgainst a fresh breeze--eleven yards a second--they would have\nadvanced backwards. In a storm--twenty-seven to thirty-three yards a\nsecond--they would have been blown about like a feather. In a\nhurricane--sixty yards a second--they would have run the risk of\nbeing dashed to pieces. And in one of those cyclones which exceed a\nhundred yards a second not a fragment of them would have been left.\nIt remained, then, even after the striking experiments of Captains\nKrebs and Renard, that though guidable aerostats had gained a little\nspeed, they could not be kept going in a moderate breeze. Hence the\nimpossibility of making practical use of this mode of aerial\nlocomotion.\n\nWith regards to the means employed to give the aerostat its motion a\ngreat deal of progress had been made. For the steam engines of Henry\nGiffard, and the muscular force of Dupuy de Lome, electric motors had\ngradually been substituted. The batteries of bichromate of potassium\nof the Tissandier brothers had given a speed of four yards a second.\nThe dynamo-electric machines of Captain Krebs and Renard had\ndeveloped a force of twelve horsepower and yielded a speed of six and\na half yards per second.\n\nWith regard to this motor, engineers and electricians had been\napproaching more and more to that desideratum which is known as a\nsteam horse in a watch case. Gradually the results of the pile of\nwhich Captains Krebs and Renard had kept the secret had been\nsurpassed, and aeronauts had become able to avail themselves of\nmotors whose lightness increased at the same time as their power.\n\nIn this there was much to encourage those who believed in the\nutilization of guidable balloons. But yet how many good people there\nare who refuse to admit the possibility of such a thing! If the\naerostat finds support in the air it belongs to the medium in which\nit moves; under such conditions, how can its mass, which offers so\nmuch resistance to the currents of the atmosphere, make its way\nagainst the wind?\n\nIn this struggle of the inventors after a light and powerful motor,\nthe Americans had most nearly attained what they sought. A\ndynamo-electric apparatus, in which a new pile was employed the\ncomposition of which was still a mystery, had been bought from its\ninventor, a Boston chemist up to then unknown. Calculations made with\nthe greatest care, diagrams drawn with the utmost exactitude, showed\nthat by means of this apparatus driving a screw of given dimensions a\ndisplacement could be obtained of from twenty to twenty-two yards a\nsecond.\n\nNow this was magnificent!\n\n\"And it is not dear,\" said Uncle Prudent, as he handed to the\ninventor in return for his formal receipt the last installment of the\nhundred thousand paper dollars he had paid for his invention.\n\nImmediately the Weldon Institute set to work. When there comes along\na project of practical utility the money leaps nimbly enough from\nAmerican pockets. The funds flowed in even without its being\nnecessary to form a syndicate. Three hundred thousand dollars came\ninto the club's account at the first appeal. The work began under the\nsuperintendence of the most celebrated aeronaut of the United States,\nHarry W. Tinder, immortalized by three of his ascents out of a\nthousand, one in which he rose to a height of twelve thousand yards,\nhigher than Gay Lussac, Coxwell, Sivet, Croc\u00c3\u00a9-Spinelli, Tissandier,\nGlaisher; another in which he had crossed America from New York to\nSan Francisco, exceeding by many hundred leagues the journeys of\nNadar, Godard, and others, to say nothing of that of John Wise, who\naccomplished eleven hundred and fifty miles from St. Louis to\nJefferson county; the third, which ended in a frightful fall from\nfifteen hundred feet at the cost of a slight sprain in the right\nthumb, while the less fortunate Pil\u00c3\u00a2tre de Rozier fell only seven\nhundred feet, and yet killed himself on the spot!\n\nAt the time this story begins the Weldon Institute had got their work\nwell in hand. In the Turner yard at Philadelphia there reposed an\nenormous aerostat, whose strength had been tried by highly compressed\nair. It well merited the name of the monster balloon.\n\nHow large was Nadar's G\u00c3\u00a9ant? Six thousand cubic meters. How large was\nJohn Wise's balloon? Twenty thousand cubic meters. How large was the\nGiffard balloon at the 1878 Exhibition? Twenty-five thousand cubic\nmeters. Compare these three aerostats with the aerial machine of the\nWeldon Institute, whose volume amounted to forty thousand cubic\nmeters, and you will understand why Uncle Prudent and his colleagues\nwere so justifiably proud of it.\n\nThis balloon not being destined for the exploration of the higher\nstrata of the atmosphere, was not called the Excelsior, a name which\nis rather too much held in honor among the citizens of America. No!\nIt was called, simply, the \"Go-Ahead,\" and all it had to do was to\njustify its name by going ahead obediently to the wishes of its\ncommander.\n\nThe dynamo-electric machine, according to the patent purchased by the\nWeldon Institute, was nearly ready. In less than six weeks the\n\"Go-Ahead\" would start for its first cruise through space.\n\nBut, as we have seen, all the mechanical difficulties had not been\novercome. Many evenings had been devoted to discussing, not the form\nof its screw nor its dimensions, but whether it ought to be put\nbehind, as the Tissandier brothers had done, or before as Captains\nKrebs and Renard had done. It is unnecessary to add that the\npartisans of the two systems had almost come to blows. The group of\n\"Beforists\" were equaled in number by the group of \"Behindists.\"\nUncle Prudent, who ought to have given the casting vote--Uncle\nPrudent, brought up doubtless in the school of Professor Buridan--could\nnot bring himself to decide.\n\nHence the impossibility of getting the screw into place. The dispute\nmight last for some time, unless the government interfered. But in\nthe United States the government meddles with private affairs as\nlittle as it possibly can. And it is right.\n\nThings were in this state at this meeting on the 13th of June, which\nthreatened to end in a riot--insults exchanged, fisticuffs\nsucceeding the insults, cane thrashings succeeding the fisticuffs,\nrevolver shots succeeding the cane thrashings--when at thirty-seven\nminutes past eight there occurred a diversion.\n\nThe porter of the Weldon Institute coolly and calmly, like a\npoliceman amid the storm of the meeting, approached the presidential\ndesk. On it he placed a card. He awaited the orders that Uncle\nPrudent found it convenient to give.\n\nUncle Prudent turned on the steam whistle, which did duty for the\npresidential bell, for even the Kremlin clock would have struck in\nvain! But the tumult slackened not.\n\nThen the president removed his hat. Thanks to this extreme measure a\nsemi-silence was obtained.\n\n\"A communication!\" said Uncle Prudent, after taking a huge pinch from\nthe snuff-box which never left him.\n\n\"Speak up!\" answered eighty-nine voices, accidentally in agreement on\nthis one point.\n\n\"A stranger, my dear colleagues, asks to be admitted to the meeting.\"\n\n\"Never!\" replied every voice.\n\n\"He desires to prove to us, it would appear,\" continued Uncle\nPrudent, \"that to believe in guiding balloons is to believe in the\nabsurdest of Utopias!\"\n\n\"Let him in! Let him in!\"\n\n\"What is the name of this singular personage?\" asked secretary Phil\nEvans.\n\n\"Robur,\" replied Uncle Prudent.\n\n\"Robur! Robur! Robur!\" yelled the assembly. And the welcome accorded\nso quickly to the curious name was chiefly due to the Weldon\nInstitute hoping to vent its exasperation on the head of him who bore\nit!\n\n\n\n\nChapter IV\n\nIN WHICH A NEW CHARACTER APPEARS\n\n\n\"Citizens of the United States! My name is Robur. I am worthy of the\nname! I am forty years old, although I look but thirty, and I have a\nconstitution of iron, a healthy vigor that nothing can shake, a\nmuscular strength that few can equal, and a digestion that would be\nthought first class even in an ostrich!\"\n\nThey were listening! Yes! The riot was quelled at once by the totally\nunexpected fashion of the speech. Was this fellow a madman or a\nhoaxer? Whoever he was, he kept his audience in hand. There was not a\nwhisper in the meeting in which but a few minutes ago the storm was\nin full fury.\n\nAnd Robur looked the man he said he was. Of middle height and\ngeometric breadth, his figure was a regular trapezium with the\ngreatest of its parallel sides formed by the line of his shoulders.\nOn this line attached by a robust neck there rose an enormous\nspheroidal head. The head of what animal did it resemble from the\npoint of view of passional analogy? The head of a bull; but a bull\nwith an intelligent face. Eyes which at the least opposition would\nglow like coals of fire; and above them a permanent contraction of\nthe superciliary muscle, an invariable sign of extreme energy. Short\nhair, slightly woolly, with metallic reflections; large chest rising\nand falling like a smith's bellows; arms, hands, legs, feet, all\nworthy of the trunk. No mustaches, no whiskers, but a large American\ngoatee, revealing the attachments of the jaw whose masseter muscles\nwere evidently of formidable strength. It has been calculated--what\nhas not been calculated?--that the pressure of the jaw of an\nordinary crocodile can reach four hundred atmospheres, while that of\na hound can only amount to one hundred. From this the following\ncurious formula has been deduced: If a kilogram of dog produces eight\nkilograms of masseteric force, a kilogram of crocodile could produce\ntwelve. Now, a kilogram of, the aforesaid Robur would not produce\nless than ten, so that he came between the dog and the crocodile.\n\nFrom what country did this remarkable specimen come? It was difficult\nto say. One thing was noticeable, and that was that he expressed\nhimself fluently in English without a trace of the drawling twang\nthat distinguishes the Yankees of New England.\n\nHe continued: \"And now, honorable citizens, for my mental faculties.\nYou see before you an engineer whose nerves are in no way inferior to\nhis muscles. I have no fear of anything or anybody. I have a strength\nof will that has never had to yield. When I have decided on a thing,\nall America, all the world, may strive in vain to keep me from it.\nWhen I have an idea, I allow no one to share it, and I do not permit\nany contradiction. I insist on these details, honorable citizens,\nbecause it is necessary you should quite understand me. Perhaps you\nthink I am talking too much about myself? It does not matter if you\ndo! And now consider a little before you interrupt me, as I have come\nto tell you something that you may not be particularly pleased to\nhear.\"\n\nA sound as of the surf on the beach began to rise along the first row\nof seats--a sign that the sea would not be long in getting stormy\nagain.\n\n\"Speak, stranger!\" said Uncle Prudent, who had some difficulty in\nrestraining himself.\n\nAnd Robur spoke as follows, without troubling himself any more about\nhis audience.\n\n\"Yes! I know it well! After a century of experiments that have led to\nnothing, and trials giving no results, there still exist ill-balanced\nminds who believe in guiding balloons. They imagine that a motor of\nsome sort, electric or otherwise, might be applied to their\npretentious skin bags which are at the mercy of every current in the\natmosphere. They persuade themselves that they can be masters of an\naerostat as they can be masters of a ship on the surface of the sea.\nBecause a few inventors in calm or nearly calm weather have succeeded\nin working an angle with the wind, or even beating to windward in a\ngentle breeze, they think that the steering of aerial apparatus\nlighter than the air is a practical matter. Well, now, look here; You\nhundred, who believe in the realization of your dreams, are throwing\nyour thousands of dollars not into water but into space! You are\nfighting the impossible!\"\n\nStrange as it was that at this affirmation the members of the Weldon\nInstitute did not move. Had they become as deaf as they were patient?\nOr were they reserving themselves to see how far this audacious\ncontradictor would dare to go?\n\nRobur continued: \"What? A balloon! When to obtain the raising of a\ncouple of pounds you require a cubic yard of gas. A balloon\npretending to resist the wind by aid of its mechanism, when the\npressure of a light breeze on a vessel's sails is not less than that\nof four hundred horsepower; when in the accident at the Tay Bridge\nyou saw the storm produce a pressure of eight and a half\nhundredweight on a square yard. A balloon, when on such a system\nnature has never constructed anything flying, whether furnished with\nwings like birds, or membranes like certain fish, or certain mammalia--\"\n\n\"Mammalia?\" exclaimed one of the members.\n\n\"Yes! Mammalia! The bat, which flies, if I am not mistaken! Is the\ngentleman unaware that this flyer is a mammal? Did he ever see an\nomelette made of bat's eggs?\"\n\nThe interrupter reserved himself for future interruption, and Robur\nresumed: \"But does that mean that man is to give up the conquest of\nthe air, and the transformation of the domestic and political manners\nof the old world, by the use of this admirable means of locomotion?\nBy no means. As he has become master of the seas with the ship, by\nthe oar, the sail, the wheel and the screw, so shall he become master\nof atmospherical space by apparatus heavier than the air--for it\nmust be heavier to be stronger than the air!\"\n\nAnd then the assembly exploded. What a broadside of yells escaped\nfrom all these mouths, aimed at Robur like the muzzles of so many\nguns! Was not this hurling a declaration of war into the very camp of\nthe balloonists? Was not this a stirring up of strife between 'the\nlighter' and 'the heavier' than air?\n\nRobur did not even frown. With folded arms he waited bravely till\nsilence was obtained.\n\nBy a gesture Uncle Prudent ordered the firing to cease.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued Robur, \"the future is for the flying machine. The\nair affords a solid fulcrum. If you will give a column of air an\nascensional movement of forty-five meters a second, a man can support\nhimself on the top of it if the soles of his boots have a superficies\nof only the eighth of a square meter. And if the speed be increased\nto ninety meters, he can walk on it with naked feet. Or if, by means\nof a screw, you drive a mass of air at this speed, you get the same\nresult.\"\n\nWhat Robur said had been said before by all the partisans of\naviation, whose work slowly but surely is leading on to the solution\nof the problem. To Ponton d'Am\u00c3\u00a9court, La Landelle, Nadar, De Luzy, De\nLouvri\u00c3\u00a9, Liais, Beleguir, Moreau, the brothers Richard, Babinet,\nJobert, Du Temple, Salives, Penaud, De Villeneuve, Gauchot and Tatin,\nMichael Loup, Edison, Planavergne, and so many others, belongs the\nhonor of having brought forward ideas of such simplicity. Abandoned\nand resumed times without number, they are sure, some day to triumph.\nTo the enemies of aviation, who urge that the bird only sustains\nhimself by warming the air he strikes, their answer is ready. Have\nthey not proved that an eagle weighing five kilograms would have to\nfill fifty cubic meters with his warm fluid merely to sustain himself\nin space?\n\nThis is what Robur demonstrated with undeniable logic amid the\nuproar that arose on all sides. And in conclusion these are the words\nhe hurled in the faces of the balloonists: \"With your aerostats you\ncan do nothing--you will arrive at nothing--you dare do nothing!\nThe boldest of your aeronauts, John Wise, although he has made an\naerial voyage of twelve hundred miles above the American continent,\nhas had to give up his project of crossing the Atlantic! And you have\nnot advanced one step--not one step--towards your end.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the president, who in vain endeavored to keep himself\ncool, \"you forget what was said by our immortal Franklin at the first\nappearance of the fire balloon, 'It is but a child, but it will\ngrow!' It was but a child, and it has grown.\"\n\n\"No, Mr. President, it has not grown! It has got fatter--and this is\nnot the same thing!\"\n\nThis was a direct attack on the Weldon Institute, which had decreed,\nhelped, and paid for the making of a monster balloon. And so\npropositions of the following kind began to fly about the room: \"Turn\nhim out!\" \"Throw him off the platform!\" \"Prove that he is heavier\nthan the air!\"\n\nBut these were only words, not means to an end.\n\nRobur remained impassible, and continued: \"There is no progress for\nyour aerostats, my citizen balloonists; progress is for flying\nmachines. The bird flies, and he is not a balloon, he is a piece of\nmechanism!\"\n\n\"Yes, he flies!\" exclaimed the fiery Bat T. Fynn; \"but he flies\nagainst all the laws of mechanics.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Robur, shrugging his shoulders, and resuming, \"Since\nwe have begun the study of the flight of large and small birds one\nsimple idea has prevailed--to imitate nature, which never makes\nmistakes. Between the albatross, which gives hardly ten beats of the\nwing per minute, between the pelican, which gives seventy--\"\n\n\"Seventy-one,\" said the voice of a scoffer.\n\n\"And the bee, which gives one hundred and ninety-two per second--\"\n\n\"One hundred and ninety-three!\" said the facetious individual.\n\n\"And, the common house fly, which gives three hundred and thirty--\"\n\n\"And a half!\"\n\n\"And the mosquito, which gives millions--\"\n\n\"No, milliards!\"\n\nBut Robur, the interrupted, interrupted not his demonstration.\n\"Between these different rates--\" he continued.\n\n\"There is a difference,\" said a voice.\n\n\"There is a possibility of finding a practical solution. When De Lucy\nshowed that the stag beetle, an insect weighing only two grammes,\ncould lift a weight of four hundred grammes, or two hundred times its\nown weight, the problem of aviation was solved. Besides, it has been\nshown that the wing surface decreases in proportion to the increase\nof the size and weight of the animal. Hence we can look forward to\nsuch contrivances--\"\n\n\"Which would never fly!\" said secretary Phil Evans.\n\n\"Which have flown, and which will fly,\" said Robur, without being in\nthe least disconcerted, \"and which we can call streophores,\nhelicopters, orthopters--or, in imitation of the word 'nef,' which\ncomes from 'navis,' call them from 'avis,' 'efs,'--by means of which\nman will become the master of space. The helix--\"\n\n\"Ah, the helix!\" replied Phil Evans. \"But the bird has no helix; that\nwe know!\"\n\n\"So,\" said Robur; \"but Penaud has shown that in reality the bird\nmakes a helix, and its flight is helicopteral. And the motor of the\nfuture is the screw--\"\n\n\"From such a maladee Saint Helix keep us free!\" sung out one of the\nmembers, who had accidentally hit upon the air from Herold's \"Zampa.\"\n\nAnd they all took up the chorus: \"From such a maladee Saint Helix\nkeep us free!\" with such intonations and variations as would have\nmade the French composer groan in his grave.\n\nAs the last notes died away in a frightful discord Uncle Prudent took\nadvantage of the momentary calm to say, \"Stranger, up to now, we let\nyou speak without interruption.\" It seemed that for the president of\nthe Weldon Institute shouts, yells, and catcalls were not\ninterruptions, but only an exchange of arguments.\n\n\"But I may remind you, all the same, that the theory of aviation is\ncondemned beforehand, and rejected by the majority of American and\nforeign engineers. It is a system which was the cause of the death of\nthe Flying Saracen at Constantinople, of the monk Volador at Lisbon,\nof De Leturn in 1852, of De Groof in 1864, besides the victims I\nforget since the mythological Icarus--\"\n\n\"A system,\" replied Robur, \"no more to be condemned than that whose\nmartyrology contains the names of Pil\u00c3\u00a2tre de Rozier at Calais, of\nBlanchard at Paris, of Donaldson and Grimwood in Lake Michigan, of\nSivel and of Croc\u00c3\u00a9-Spinelli, and others whom it takes good care, to\nforget.\"\n\nThis was a counter-thrust with a vengeance.\n\n\"Besides,\" continued Robur, \"With your balloons as good as you can\nmake them you will never obtain any speed worth mentioning. It would\ntake you ten years to go round the world--and a flying machine could\ndo it in a week!\"\n\nHere arose a new tempest of protests and denials which lasted for\nthree long minutes. And then Phil Evans look up the word.\n\n\"Mr. Aviator,\" he said \"you who talk so much of the benefits of\naviation, have you ever aviated?\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"And made the conquest of the air?\"\n\n\"Not unlikely.\"\n\n\"Hooray for Robur the Conqueror!\" shouted an ironical voice.\n\n\"Well, yes! Robur the Conqueror! I accept the name and I will bear\nit, for I have a right to it!\"\n\n\"We beg to doubt it!\" said Jem Chip.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Robur, and his brows knit, \"when I have just\nseriously stated a serious thing I do not permit anyone to reply to\nme by a flat denial, and I shall be glad to know the name of the\ninterrupter.\"\n\n\"My name is Chip, and I am a vegetarian.\"\n\n\"Citizen Chip,\" said Robur, \"I knew that vegetarians had longer\nalimentary canals than other men--a good foot longer at the least.\nThat is quite long enough; and so do not compel me to make you any\nlonger by beginning at your ears and--\"\n\n\"Throw him out.\"\n\n\"Into the street with him!\"\n\n\"Lynch him!\"\n\n\"Helix him!\"\n\nThe rage of the balloonists burst forth at last. They rushed at the\nplatform. Robur disappeared amid a sheaf of hands that were thrown\nabout as if caught in a storm. In vain the steam whistle screamed its\nfanfares on to the assembly. Philadelphia might well think that a\nfire was devouring one of its quarters and that all the waters of the\nSchuyllkill could not put it out.\n\nSuddenly there was a recoil in the tumult. Robur had put his hands\ninto his pockets and now held them out at the front ranks of the\ninfuriated mob.\n\nIn each hand was one of those American institutions known as\nrevolvers which the mere pressure of the fingers is enough to\nfire--pocket mitrailleuses in fact.\n\nAnd taking advantage not only of the recoil of his assailants but\nalso of the silence which accompanied it.\n\n\"Decidedly,\" said he, \"it was not Amerigo that discovered the New\nWorld, it was Cabot! You are not Americans, citizen balloonists! You\nare only Cabo--\"\n\nFour or five shots cracked out, fired into space. They hurt nobody.\nAmid the smoke, the engineer vanished; and when it had thinned away\nthere was no trace of him. Robur the Conqueror had flown, as if some\napparatus of aviation had borne him into the air.\n\n\n\n\nChapter V\n\nANOTHER DISAPPEARANCE\n\n\nThis was not the first occasion on which, at the end of their stormy\ndiscussions, the members of the Weldon Institute had filled Walnut\nStreet and its neighborhood with their tumult. Several times had the\ninhabitants complained of the noisy way in which the proceedings\nended, and more than once had the policemen had to interfere to clear\nthe thoroughfare for the passersby, who for the most part were\nsupremely indifferent on the question of aerial navigation. But never\nbefore had the tumult attained such proportions, never had the\ncomplaints been better founded, never had the intervention of the\npolice been more necessary.\n\nBut there was some excuse for the members of the Weldon Institute.\nThey had been attacked in their own house. To these enthusiasts for\n\"lighter than air\" a no less enthusiast for \"heavier than air\" had\nsaid things absolutely abhorrent. And at the moment they were about\nto treat him as he deserved, he had disappeared.\n\nSo they cried aloud for vengeance. To leave such insults unpunished\nwas impossible to all with American blood in their veins. Had not the\nsons of Amerigo been called the sons of Cabot? Was not that an insult\nas unpardonable as it happened to be just--historically?\n\nThe members of the club in several groups rushed down Walnut Street,\nthen into the adjoining streets, and then all over the neighborhood.\nThey woke up the householders; they compelled them to search their\nhouses, prepared to indemnify them later on for the outrage on their\nprivacy. Vain were all their trouble and searching. Robur was nowhere\nto be found; there was no trace of him. He might have gone off in the\n\"Go-Ahead,\" the balloon of the Institute, for all they could tell.\nAfter an hour's hunt the members had to give in and separate, not\nbefore they had agreed to extend their search over the whole\nterritory of the twin Americas that form the new continent.\n\nBy eleven o'clock quiet had been restored in the neighborhood of\nWalnut Street. Philadelphia was able to sink again into that sound\nsleep which is the privilege of non-manufacturing towns. The\ndifferent members of the club parted to seek their respective houses.\nTo mention the most distinguished amongst them, William T. Forbes\nsought his large sugar establishment, where Miss Doll and Miss Mat\nhad prepared for him his evening tea, sweetened with his own glucose.\nTruck Milnor took the road to his factory in the distant suburb,\nwhere the engines worked day and night. Treasurer Jim Chip, publicly\naccused of possessing an alimentary canal twelve inches longer than\nthat of other men, returned to the vegetable soup that was waiting\nfor him.\n\nTwo of the most important balloonists--two only--did not seem to\nthink of returning so soon to their domicile. They availed themselves\nof the opportunity to discuss the question with more than usual\nacrimony. These were the irreconcilables, Uncle Prudent and Phil\nEvans, the president and secretary of the Weldon Institute.\n\nAt the door of the club the valet Frycollin waited for Uncle Prudent,\nhis master, and at last he went after him, though he cared but little\nfor the subject which had set the two colleagues at loggerheads.\n\nIt is only an euphemism that the verb \"discuss\" can be used to\nexpress the way in which the duet between the president and secretary\nwas being performed. As a matter of fact they were in full wrangle\nwith an energy born of their old rivalry.\n\n\"No, Sir, no,\" said Phil Evans. \"If I had had the honor of being\npresident of the Weldon Institute, there never, no, never, would have\nbeen such a scandal.\"\n\n\"And what would you have done, if you had had the honor?\" demanded\nUncle Prudent.\n\n\"I would have stopped the insulter before he had opened his mouth.\"\n\n\"It seems to me it would have been impossible to stop him until he\nhad opened his mouth,\" replied Uncle Prudent.\n\n\"Not in America, Sir; not in America.\"\n\nAnd exchanging such observations, increasing in bitterness as they\nwent, they walked on through the streets farther and farther from\ntheir homes, until they reached a part of the city whence they had to\ngo a long way round to get back.\n\nFrycollin followed, by no means at ease to see his master plunging\ninto such deserted spots. He did not like deserted spots,\nparticularly after midnight. In fact the darkness was profound, and\nthe moon was only a thin crescent just beginning its monthly life.\nFrycollin kept a lookout to the left and right of him to see if he\nwas followed. And he fancied he could see five or six hulking follows\ndogging his footsteps. Instinctively he drew nearer to his master,\nbut not for the world would he have dared to break in on the\nconversation of which the fragments reached him.\n\nIn short it so chanced that the president and secretary of the Weldon\nInstitute found themselves on the road to Fairmount Park. In the full\nheat of their dispute they crossed the Schuyllkill river by the\nfamous iron bridge. They met only a few belated wayfarers, and\npressed on across a wide open tract where the immense prairie was\nbroken every now and then by the patches of thick woodland--which\nmake the park different to any other in the world.\n\nThere Frycollin's terror became acute, particularly as he saw the\nfive or six shadows gliding after him across the Schuyllkill bridge.\nThe pupils of his eyes broadened out to the circumference of his\niris, and his limbs seemed to diminish as if endowed with the\ncontractility peculiar to the mollusca and certain of the articulate;\nfor Frycollin, the valet, was an egregious coward.\n\nHe was a pure South Carolina Negro, with the head of a fool and the\ncarcass of an imbecile. Being only one and twenty, he had never been\na slave, not even by birth, but that made no difference to him.\nGrinning and greedy and idle, and a magnificent poltroon, he had been\nthe servant of Uncle Prudent for about three years. Over and over\nagain had his master threatened to kick him out, but had kept him on\nfor fear of doing worse. With a master ever ready to venture on the\nmost audacious enterprises, Frycollin's cowardice had brought him\nmany arduous trials. But he had some compensation. Very little had\nbeen said about his gluttony, and still less about his laziness.\n\nAh, Valet Frycollin, if you could only have read the future! Why, oh\nwhy, Frycollin, did you not remain at Boston with the Sneffels, and\nnot have given them up when they talked of going to Switzerland? Was\nnot that a much more suitable place for you than this of Uncle\nPrudent's, where danger was daily welcomed?\n\nBut here he was, and his master had become used to his faults. He had\none advantage, and that was a consideration. Although he was a Negro\nby birth he did not speak like a Negro, and nothing is so irritating\nas that hateful jargon in which all the pronouns are possessive and\nall the verbs infinitive. Let it be understood, then, that Frycollin\nwas a thorough coward.\n\nAnd now it was midnight, and the pale crescent of the moon began to\nsink in the west behind the trees in the park. The rays streaming\nfitfully through the branches made the shadows darker than ever.\nFrycollin looked around him anxiously. \"Brrr!\" he said, \"There are\nthose fellows there all the time. Positively they are getting nearer!\nMaster Uncle!\" he shouted.\n\nIt was thus he called the president of the Weldon Institute, and thus\ndid the president desire to be called.\n\nAt the moment the dispute of the rivals had reached its maximum, and\nas they hurled their epithets at each other they walked faster and\nfaster, and drew farther and farther away from the Schuyllkill\nbridge. They had reached the center of a wide clump of trees, whose\nsummits were just tipped by the parting rays of the moon. Beyond the\ntrees was a very large clearing--an oval field, a complete\namphitheater. Not a hillock was there to hinder the gallop of the\nhorses, not a bush to stop the view of the spectators.\n\nAnd if Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans had not been so deep in their\ndispute, and had used their eyes as they were accustomed to, they\nwould have found the clearing was not in its usual state. Was it a\nflour mill that had anchored on it during the night? It looked like\nit, with its wings and sails--motionless and mysterious in the\ngathering gloom.\n\nBut neither the president nor the secretary of the Weldon Institute\nnoticed the strange modification in the landscape of Fairmount Park;\nand neither did Frycollin. It seemed to him that the thieves were\napproaching, and preparing for their attack; and he was seized with\nconvulsive fear, paralyzed in his limbs, with every hair he could\nboast of on the bristle. His terror was extreme. His knees bent under\nhim, but he had just strength enough to exclaim for the last time,\n\"Master Uncle! Master Uncle!\"\n\n\"What is the matter with you?\" asked Uncle Prudent.\n\nPerhaps the disputants would not have been sorry to have relieved\ntheir fury at the expense of the unfortunate valet. But they had no\ntime; and neither even had he time to answer.\n\nA whistle was heard. A flash of electric light shot across the\nclearing.\n\nA signal, doubtless? The moment had come for the deed of violence. In\nless time that it takes to tell, six men came leaping across from\nunder the trees, two onto Uncle Prudent, two onto Phil Evans, two\nonto Frycollin--there was no need for the last two, for the Negro\nwas incapable of defending himself. The president and secretary of\nthe Weldon Institute, although taken by surprise, would have resisted.\n\nThey had neither time nor strength to do so. In a second they were\nrendered speechless by a gag, blind by a bandage, thrown down,\npinioned and carried bodily off across the clearing. What could they\nthink except that they had fallen into the hands of people who\nintended to rob them? The people did nothing of the sort, however.\nThey did not even touch Uncle Prudent's pockets, although, according\nto his custom, they were full of paper dollars.\n\nWithin a minute of the attack, without a word being passed, Uncle\nPrudent, Phil Evans, and Frycollin felt themselves laid gently down,\nnot on the grass, but on a sort of plank that creaked beneath them.\nThey were laid down side by side.\n\nA door was shut; and the grating of a bolt in a staple told them that\nthey were prisoners.\n\nThen there came a continuous buzzing, a quivering, a frrrr, with the\nrrr unending.\n\nAnd that was the only sound that broke the quiet of the night.\n\nGreat was the excitement next morning in Philadelphia Very early was\nit known what had passed at the meeting of the Institute. Everyone\nknew of the appearance of the mysterious engineer named Robur--Robur\nthe Conqueror--and the tumult among the balloonists, and his\ninexplicable disappearance. But it was quite another thing when all\nthe town heard that the president and secretary of the club had also\ndisappeared during the night.\n\nLong and keen was the search in the city and neighborhood! Useless!\nThe newspapers of Philadelphia, the newspapers of Pennsylvania, the\nnewspapers of the United States reported the facts and explained them\nin a hundred ways, not one of which was the right one. Heavy rewards\nwere offered, and placards were pasted up, but all to no purpose. The\nearth seemed to have opened and bodily swallowed the president and\nsecretary of the Weldon Institute.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VI\n\nTHE PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY SUSPEND HOSTILITIES\n\n\nA bandage over the eyes, a gag in the mouth, a cord round the wrists,\na cord round the ankles, unable to see, to speak, or to move, Uncle\nPrudent, Phil Evans, and Frycollin were anything but pleased with\ntheir position. Knowing not who had seized them, nor in what they had\nbeen thrown like parcels in a goods wagon, nor where they were, nor\nwhat was reserved for them--it was enough to exasperate even the\nmost patient of the ovine race, and we know that the members of the\nWeldon Institute were not precisely sheep as far as patience went.\nWith his violence of character we can easily imagine how Uncle\nPrudent felt. One thing was evident, that Phil Evans and he would\nfind it difficult to attend the club next evening.\n\nAs to Frycollin, with his eyes shut and his mouth closed, it was\nimpossible for him to think of anything. He was more dead than alive.\n\nFor an hour the position of the prisoners remained unchanged. No one\ncame to visit them, or to give them that liberty of movement and\nspeech of which they lay in such need. They were reduced to stifled\nsighs, to grunts emitted over and under their gags, to everything\nthat betrayed anger kept dumb and fury imprisoned, or rather bound\ndown. Then after many fruitless efforts they remained for some time\nas though lifeless. Then as the sense of sight was denied them they\ntried by their sense of hearing to obtain some indication of the\nnature of this disquieting state of things. But in vain did they seek\nfor any other sound than an interminable and inexplicable f-r-r-r\nwhich seemed to envelop them in a quivering atmosphere.\n\nAt last something happened. Phil Evans, regaining his coolness,\nmanaged to slacken the cord which bound his wrists. Little by little\nthe knot slipped, his fingers slipped over each other, and his hands\nregained their usual freedom.\n\nA vigorous rubbing restored the circulation. A moment after he had\nslipped off the bandage which bound his eyes, taken the gag out of\nhis mouth, and cut the cords round his ankles with his knife. An\nAmerican who has not a bowie-knife in his pocket is no longer an\nAmerican.\n\nBut if Phil Evans had regained the power of moving and speaking, that\nwas all. His eyes were useless to him--at present at any rate. The\nprison was quite dark, though about six feet above him a feeble gleam\nof light came in through a kind of loophole.\n\nAs may be imagined, Phil Evans did not hesitate to at once set free\nhis rival. A few cuts with the bowie settled the knots which bound\nhim foot and hand.\n\nImmediately Uncle Prudent rose to his knees and snatched away his\nbandage and gag.\n\n\"Thanks,\" said he, in stifled voice.\n\n\"Phil Evans?\"\n\n\"Uncle Prudent?\"\n\n\"Here we are no longer the president and secretary of the Weldon\nInstitute. We are adversaries no more.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" answered Evans. \"We are now only two men agreed to\navenge ourselves on a third whose attempt deserves severe reprisals.\nAnd this third is--\"\n\n\"Robur!\"\n\n\"It is Robur!\"\n\nOn this point both were absolutely in accord. On this subject there\nwas no fear of dispute.\n\n\"And your servant?\" said Phil Evans, pointing to Frycollin, who was\npuffing like a grampus. \"We must set him free.\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Uncle Prudent. \"He would overwhelm us with his\njeremiads, and we have something else to do than abuse each other.\"\n\n\"What is that, Uncle Prudent?\"\n\n\"To save ourselves if possible.\"\n\n\"You are right, even if it is impossible.\"\n\n\"And even if it is impossible.\"\n\nThere could be no doubt that this kidnapping was due to Robur, for an\nordinary thief would have relieved them of their watches, jewelry,\nand purses, and thrown their bodies into the Schuyllkill with a good\ngash in their throats instead of throwing them to the bottom of--Of\nwhat? That was a serious question, which would have to be answered\nbefore attempting an escape with any chance of success.\n\n\"Phil Evans,\" began Uncle Prudent, \"if, when we came away from our\nmeeting, instead of indulging in amenities to which we need not\nrecur, we had kept our eyes more open, this would not have happened.\nHad we remained in the streets of Philadelphia there would have been\nnone of this. Evidently Robur foresaw what would happen at the club,\nand had placed some of his bandits on guard at the door. When we left\nWalnut Street these fellows must have watched us and followed us, and\nwhen we imprudently ventured into Fairmount Park they went in for\ntheir little game.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" said Evans. \"We were wrong not to go straight home.\"\n\n\"It is always wrong not to be right,\" said Prudent.\n\nHere a long-drawn sigh escaped from the darkest corner of the prison.\n\"What is that?\" asked Evans.\n\n\"Nothing! Frycollin is dreaming.\"\n\n\"Between the moment we were seized a few steps out into the clearing\nand the moment we were thrown in here only two minutes elapsed. It is\nthus evident that those people did not take us out of Fairmount Park.\"\n\n\"And if they had done so we should have felt we were being moved.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly; and consequently we must be in some vehicle, perhaps\nsome of those long prairie wagons, or some show-caravan--\"\n\n\"Evidently! For if we were in a boat moored on the Schuyllkill we\nshould have noticed the movement due to the current--\"\n\n\"That is so; and as we are still in the clearing, I think that now is\nthe time to get away, and we can return later to settle with this\nRobur--\"\n\n\"And make him pay for this attempt on the liberty of two citizens of\nthe United States.\"\n\n\"And he shall pay pretty dearly!\"\n\n\"But who is this man? Where does he come from? Is he English, or\nGerman, or French--\"\n\n\"He is a scoundrel, that is enough!\" said Uncle Prudent. \"Now to\nwork.\" And then the two men, with their hands stretched out and their\nfingers wide apart, began to feel round the walls to find a joint or\ncrack.\n\nNothing. Nothing; not even at the door. It was closely shut and it\nwas impossible to shoot back the lock. All that could be done was to\nmake a hole, and escape through the hole. It remained to be seen if\nthe knives could cut into the walls.\n\n\"But whence comes this never-ending rustling?\" asked Evans, who was\nmuch impressed at the continuous f-r-r-r.\n\n\"The wind, doubtless,\" said Uncle Prudent.\n\n\"The wind! But I thought the night was quite calm.\"\n\n\"So it was. But if it isn't the wind, what can it be?\"\n\nPhil Evans got out the best blade of his knife and set to work on the\nwall near the door. Perhaps he might make a hole which would enable\nhim to open it from the outside should it be only bolted or should\nthe key have been left in the lock. He worked away for some minutes.\nThe only result was to nip up his knife, to snip off its point, and\ntransform what was left of the blade into a saw.\n\n\"Doesn't it cut?\" asked Uncle Prudent.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Is the wall made of sheet iron?\"\n\n\"No; it gives no metallic sound when you hit it.\"\n\n\"Is it of ironwood?\"\n\n\"No; it isn't iron and it isn't wood.\"\n\n\"What is it then?\"\n\n\"Impossible to say. But, anyhow, steel doesn't touch it.\" Uncle\nPrudent, in a sudden outburst of fury, began to rave and stamp on the\nsonorous planks, while his hands sought to strangle an imaginary\nRobur.\n\n\"Be calm, Prudent, be calm! You have a try.\"\n\nUncle Prudent had a try, but the bowie-knife could do nothing against\na wall which its best blades could not even scratch. The wall seemed\nto be made of crystal.\n\nSo it became evident that all flight was impracticable except through\nthe door, and for a time they must resign themselves to their fate--not\na very pleasant thing for the Yankee temperament, and very much\nto the disgust of these eminently practical men. But this conclusion\nwas not arrived at without many objurgations and loud-sounding\nphrases hurled at this Robur--who, from what had been seen of him at\nthe Weldon Institute, was not the sort of man to trouble himself much\nabout them.\n\nSuddenly Frycollin began to give unequivocal signs of being unwell.\nHe began to writhe in a most lamentable fashion, either with cramp in\nhis stomach or in his limbs; and Uncle Prudent, thinking it his duty\nto put an end to these gymnastics, cut the cords that bound him.\n\nHe had cause to be sorry for it. Immediately there was poured forth\nan interminable litany, in which the terrors of fear were mingled\nwith the tortures of hunger. Frycollin was no worse in his brain than\nin his stomach, and it would have been difficult to decide to which\norgan the chief cause of the trouble should be assigned.\n\n\"Frycollin!\" said Uncle Prudent.\n\n\"Master Uncle! Master Uncle!\" answered the Negro between two of his\nlugubrious howls.\n\n\"It is possible that we are doomed to die of hunger in this prison,\nbut we have made up our minds not to succumb until we have availed\nourselves of every means of alimentation to prolong our lives.\"\n\n\"To eat me?\" exclaimed Frycollin.\n\n\"As is always done with a Negro under such circumstances! So you had\nbetter not make yourself too obvious--\"\n\n\"Or you'll have your bones picked!\" said Evans.\n\nAnd as Frycollin saw he might be used to prolong two existences more\nprecious than his own, he contented himself thenceforth with groaning\nin quiet.\n\nThe time went on and all attempts to force the door or get through\nthe wall proved fruitless. What the wall was made of was impossible\nto say. It was not metal; it was not wood; it was not stone, And all\nthe cell seemed to be made of the same stuff. When they stamped on\nthe floor it gave a peculiar sound that Uncle Prudent found it\ndifficult to describe; the floor seemed to sound hollow, as if it was\nnot resting directly on the ground of the clearing. And the\ninexplicable f-r-r-r-r seemed to sweep along below it. All of which\nwas rather alarming.\n\n\"Uncle Prudent,\" said Phil Evans.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Do you think our prison has been moved at all?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of.\"\n\n\"Because when we were first caught I distinctly remember the fresh\nfragrance of the grass and the resinous odor of the park trees. While\nnow, when I take in a good sniff of the air, it seems as though all\nthat had gone.\"\n\n\"So it has.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"We cannot say why unless we admit that the prison has moved; and I\nsay again that if the prison had moved, either as a vehicle on the\nroad or a boat on the stream, we should have felt it.\"\n\nHere Frycollin gave vent to a long groan, which might have been taken\nfor his last had he not followed it up with several more.\n\n\"I expect Robur will soon have us brought before him,\" said Phil\nEvans.\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Uncle Prudent. \"And I shall tell him--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That he began by being rude and ended in being unbearable.\"\n\nHere Phil Evans noticed that day was beginning to break. A gleam,\nstill faint, filtered through the narrow window opposite the door. It\nought thus to be about four o'clock in the morning for it is at that\nhour in the month of June in this latitude that the horizon of\nPhiladelphia is tinged by the first rays of the dawn.\n\nBut when Uncle Prudent sounded his repeater--which was a masterpiece\nfrom his colleague's factory--the tiny gong only gave a quarter to\nthree, and the watch had not stopped.\n\n\"That is strange!\" said Phil Evans. \"At a quarter to three it ought\nstill to be night.\"\n\n\"Perhaps my watch has got slow,\" answered Uncle Prudent.\n\n\"A watch of the Wheelton Watch Company!\" exclaimed Phil Evans.\n\nWhatever might be the reason, there was no doubt that the day was\nbreaking. Gradually the window became white in the deep darkness of\nthe cell. However, if the dawn appeared sooner than the fortieth\nparallel permitted, it did not advance with the rapidity peculiar to\nlower latitudes. This was another observation--of Uncle Prudent's--a\nnew inexplicable phenomenon.\n\n\"Couldn't we get up to the window and see where we are?\"\n\n\"We might,\" said Uncle Prudent. \"Frycollin, get up!\"\n\nThe Negro arose.\n\n\"Put your back against the wall,\" continued Prudent, \"and you, Evans,\nget on his shoulders while I buttress him up.\"\n\n\"Right!\" said Evans.\n\nAn instant afterwards his knees were on Frycollin's shoulders, and\nhis eyes were level with the window. The window was not of lenticular\nglass like those on shipboard, but was a simple flat pane. It was\nsmall, and Phil Evans found his range of view was much limited.\n\n\"Break the glass,\" said Prudent, \"and perhaps you will be able to see\nbetter.\"\n\nPhil Evans gave it a sharp knock with the handle of his bowie-knife.\nIt gave back a silvery sound, but it did not break.\n\nAnother and more violent blow. The same result.\n\n\"It is unbreakable glass!\" said Evans.\n\nIt appeared as though the pane was made of glass toughened on the\nSiemens system--as after several blows it remained intact.\n\nThe light had now increased, and Phil Evans could see for some\ndistance within the radius allowed by the frame.\n\n\"What do you see?\" asked Uncle Prudent.\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"What? Not any trees?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Not even the top branches?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then we are not in the clearing?\"\n\n\"Neither in the clearing nor in the park.\"\n\n\"Don't you see any roofs of houses or monuments?\" said Prudent, whose\ndisappointment and anger were increasing rapidly.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What! Not a flagstaff, nor a church tower, nor a chimney?\"\n\n\"Nothing but space.\"\n\nAs he uttered the words the door opened. A man appeared on the\nthreshold. It was Robur.\n\n\"Honorable balloonists\" he said, in a serious voice, \"you are now\nfree to go and come as you like.\"\n\n\"Free!\" exclaimed Uncle Prudent.\n\n\"Yes--within the limits of the \"Albatross!\"\n\nUncle Prudent and Phil Evans rushed out of their prison. And what did\nthey see?\n\nFour thousand feet below them the face of a country they sought in\nvain to recognize.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VII\n\nON BOARD THE ALBATROSS\n\n\n\"When will man cease to crawl in the depths to live in the azure and\nquiet of the sky?\"\n\nTo this question of Camille Flammarion's the answer is easy. It will\nbe when the progress of mechanics has enabled us to solve the problem\nof aviation. And in a few years--as we can foresee--a more\npractical utilization of electricity will do much towards that\nsolution.\n\nIn 1783, before the Montgolfier brothers had built their\nfire-balloon, and Charles, the physician, had devised his first\naerostat, a few adventurous spirits had dreamt of the conquest of\nspace by mechanical means. The first inventors did not think of\napparatus lighter than air, for that the science of their time did\nnot allow them to imagine. It was to contrivances heavier than air,\nto flying machines in imitation of the birds, that they trusted to\nrealize aerial locomotion.\n\nThis was exactly what had been done by that madman Icarus, the son of\nDaedalus, whose wings, fixed together with wax, had melted as they\napproached the sun.\n\nBut without going back to mythological times, without dwelling on\nArchytas of Tarentum, we find, in the works of Dante of Perugia, of\nLeonardo da Vinci and Guidotti, the idea of machines made to move\nthrough the air. Two centuries and a half afterwards inventors began\nto multiply. In 1742 the Marquis de Bacqueville designed a system of\nwings, tried it over the Seine, and fell and broke his arm. In 1768\nPaucton conceived the idea of an apparatus with two screws,\nsuspensive and propulsive. In 1781 Meerwein, the architect of the\nPrince of Baden, built an orthopteric machine, and protested against\nthe tendency of the aerostats which had just been invented. In 1784\nLaunoy and Bienvenu had maneuvered a helicopter worked by springs. In\n1808 there were the attempts at flight by the Austrian Jacques Degen.\nIn 1810 came the pamphlet by Denian of Nantes, in which the\nprinciples of \"heavier than air\" are laid down. From 1811 to 1840\ncame the inventions and researches of Derblinger, Vigual, Sarti,\nDubochet, and Cagniard de Latour. In 1842 we have the Englishman\nHenson, with his system of inclined planes and screws worked by\nsteam. In 1845 came Cossus and his ascensional screws. In 1847 came\nCamille Vert and his helicopter made of birds' wings. In 1852 came\nLetur with his system of guidable parachutes, whose trial cost him\nhis life; and in the same year came Michel Loup with his plan of\ngliding through the air on four revolving wings. In 1853 came\nB\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a9guic and his aeroplane with the traction screws, Vaussin-Chardannes\nwith his guidable kite, and George Cauley with his flying machines\ndriven by gas. From 1854 to 1863 appeared Joseph Pline with several\npatents for aerial systems. Br\u00c3\u00a9ant, Carlingford, Le Bris, Du\nTemple, Bright, whose ascensional screws were left-handed; Smythies,\nPanafieu, Crosnier, &c. At length, in 1863, thanks to the efforts\nof Nadar, a society of \"heavier than air\" was founded in Paris.\nThere the inventors could experiment with the machines, of which\nmany were patented. Ponton d'Am\u00c3\u00a9court and his steam helicopter, La\nLandelle and his system of combining screws with inclined planes\nand parachutes, Louvri\u00c3\u00a9 and his aeroscape, Esterno and his mechanical\nbird, Groof and his apparatus with wings worked by levers. The\nimpetus was given, inventors invented, calculators calculated\nall that could render aerial locomotion practicable. Bourcart,\nLe Bris, Kaufmann, Smyth, Stringfellow, Prigent, Danjard, Pom\u00c3\u00a9s\nand De la Pauze, Moy, P\u00c3\u00a9naud, Jobert, Haureau de Villeneuve,\nAchenbach, Garapon, Duchesne, Danduran, Pariesel, Dieuaide,\nMelkiseff, Forlanini, Bearey, Tatin, Dandrieux, Edison, some with\nwings or screws, others with inclined planes, imagined, created,\nconstructed, perfected, their flying machines, ready to do their\nwork, once there came to be applied to thereby some inventor a motor\nof adequate power and excessive lightness.\n\nThis list may be a little long, but that will be forgiven, for it is\nnecessary to give the various steps in the ladder of aerial\nlocomotion, on the top of which appeared Robur the Conqueror. Without\nthese attempts, these experiments of his predecessors, how could the\ninquirer have conceived so perfect an apparatus? And though he had\nbut contempt for those who obstinately worked away in the direction\nof balloons, he held in high esteem all those partisans of \"heavier\nthan air,\" English, American, Italian, Austrian, French--and\nparticularly French--whose work had been perfected by him, and led\nhim to design and then to build this flying engine known as the\n\"Albatross,\" which he was guiding through the currents of the\natmosphere.\n\n\"The pigeon flies!\" had exclaimed one of the most persistent adepts\nat aviation.\n\n\"They will crowd the air as they crowd the earth!\" said one of his\nmost excited partisans.\n\n\"From the locomotive to the aeromotive!\" shouted the noisiest of all,\nwho had turned on the trumpet of publicity to awaken the Old and New\nWorlds.\n\nNothing, in fact, is better established, by experiment and\ncalculation, than that the air is highly resistant. A circumference\nof only a yard in diameter in the shape of a parachute can not only\nimpede descent in air, but can render it isochronous. That is a fact.\n\nIt is equally well known that when the speed is great the work of the\nweight varies in almost inverse ratio to the square of the speed, and\ntherefore becomes almost insignificant.\n\nIt is also known that as the weight of a flying animal increases, the\nless is the proportional increase in the surface beaten by the wings\nin order to sustain it, although the motion of the wings becomes\nslower.\n\nA flying machine must therefore be constructed to take advantage of\nthese natural laws, to imitate the bird, \"that admirable type of\naerial locomotion,\" according to Dr. Marcy, of the Institute of\nFrance.\n\nIn short the contrivances likely to solve the problem are of three\nkinds:--\n\n1. Helicopters or spiralifers, which are simply screws with vertical\naxes.\n\n2. Ornithopters, machines which endeavour to reproduce the natural\nflight of birds.\n\n3. Aeroplanes, which are merely inclined planes like kites, but towed\nor driven by screws.\n\nEach of these systems has had and still has it partisans obstinately\nresolved to give way in not the slightest particular. However, Robur,\nfor many reasons, had rejected the two first.\n\nThe ornithopter, or mechanical bird, offers certain advantages, no\ndoubt. That the work and experiments of M. Renard in 1884 have\nsufficiently proved. But, as has been said, it is not necessary to\ncopy Nature servilely. Locomotives are not copied from the hare, nor\nare ships copied from the fish. To the first we have put wheels which\nare not legs; to the second we have put screws which are not fins.\nAnd they do not do so badly. Besides, what is this mechanical\nmovement in the flight of birds, whose action is so complex? Has not\nDoctor Marcy suspected that the feathers open during the return of\nthe wings so as to let the air through them? And is not that rather a\ndifficult operation for an artificial machine?\n\nOn the other hand, aeroplanes have given many good results. Screws\nopposing a slanting plane to the bed of air will produce an\nascensional movement, and the models experimented on have shown that\nthe disposable weight, that is to say the weight it is possible to\ndeal with as distinct from that of the apparatus, increases with the\nsquare of the speed. Herein the aeroplane has the advantage over the\naerostat even when the aerostat is furnished with the means of\nlocomotion.\n\nNevertheless Robur had thought that the simpler his contrivance the\nbetter. And the screws--the Saint Helices that had been thrown in\nhis teeth at the Weldon Institute--had sufficed for all the needs of\nhis flying machine. One series could hold it suspended in the air,\nthe other could drive it along under conditions that were marvelously\nadapted for speed and safety.\n\nIf the ornithopter--striking like the wings of a bird--raised\nitself by beating the air, the helicopter raised itself by striking\nthe air obliquely, with the fins of the screw as it mounted on an\ninclined plane. These fins, or arms, are in reality wings, but wings\ndisposed as a helix instead of as a paddle wheel. The helix advances\nin the direction of its axis. Is the axis vertical? Then it moves\nvertically. Is the axis horizontal? Then it moves horizontally.\n\nThe whole of Robur's flying apparatus depended on these two\nmovements, as will be seen from the following detailed description,\nwhich can be divided under three heads--the platform, the engines of\nsuspension and propulsion, and the machinery.\n\nPlatform.--This was a framework a hundred feet long and twelve wide,\na ship's deck in fact, with a projecting prow. Beneath was a hull\nsolidly built, enclosing the engines, stores, and provisions of all\nsorts, including the watertanks. Round the deck a few light uprights\nsupported a wire trellis that did duty for bulwarks. On the deck were\nthree houses, whose compartments were used as cabins for the crew, or\nas machine rooms. In the center house was the machine which drove the\nsuspensory helices, in that forward was the machine that drove the\nbow screw, in that aft was the machine that drove the stern screw. In\nthe bow were the cook's galley and the crew's quarters; in the stern\nwere several cabins, including that of the engineer, the saloon, and\nabove them all a glass house in which stood the helmsman, who steered\nthe vessel by means of a powerful rudder. All these cabins were\nlighted by port-holes filled with toughened glass, which has ten\ntimes the resistance of ordinary glass. Beneath the hull was a system\nof flexible springs to ease off the concussion when it became\nadvisable to land.\n\nEngines of suspension and propulsion.--Above the deck rose\nthirty-seven vertical axes, fifteen along each side, and seven, more\nelevated, in the centre. The \"Albatross\" might be called a clipper\nwith thirty-seven masts. But these masts instead of sails bore each\ntwo horizontal screws, not very large in spread or diameter, but\ndriven at prodigious speed. Each of these axes had its own movement\nindependent of the rest, and each alternate one spun round in a\ndifferent direction from the others, so as to avoid any tendency to\ngyration. Hence the screws as they rose on the vertical column of air\nretained their equilibrium by their horizontal resistance.\nConsequently the apparatus was furnished with seventy-four suspensory\nscrews, whose three branches were connected by a metallic circle\nwhich economized their motive force. In front and behind, mounted on\nhorizontal axes, were two propelling screws, each with four arms.\nThese screws were of much larger diameter than the suspensory ones,\nbut could be worked at quite their speed. In fact, the vessel\ncombined the systems of Cossus, La Landelle, and Ponton d'Am\u00c3\u00a9court, as\nperfected by Robur. But it was in the choice and application of his\nmotive force that he could claim to be an inventor.\n\nMachinery.--Robur had not availed himself of the vapor of water or\nother liquids, nor compressed air and other mechanical motion. He\nemployed electricity, that agent which one day will be the soul of\nthe industrial world. But he required no electro-motor to produce it.\nAll he trusted to was piles and accumulators. What were the elements\nof these piles, and what were the acids he used, Robur only knew. And\nthe construction of the accumulators was kept equally secret. Of what\nwere their positive and negative plates? None can say. The engineer\ntook good care--and not unreasonably--to keep his secret\nunpatented. One thing was unmistakable, and that was that the piles\nwere of extraordinary strength; and the accumulators left those of\nFaure-Sellon-Volckmar very far behind in yielding currents whose\namp\u00c3\u00a8res ran into figures up to then unknown. Thus there was obtained\na power to drive the screws and communicate a suspending and\npropelling force in excess of all his requirements under any\ncircumstances.\n\nBut--it is as well to repeat it--this belonged entirely to Robur.\nHe kept it a close secret. And, if the president and secretary of the\nWeldon Institute did not happen to discover it, it would probably be\nlost to humanity.\n\nIt need not be shown that the apparatus possessed sufficient\nstability. Its center of gravity proved that at once. There was no\ndanger of its making alarming angles with the horizontal, still less\nof its capsizing.\n\nAnd now for the metal used by Robur in the construction of his\naeronef--a name which can be exactly applied to the \"Albatross.\"\nWhat was this material, so hard that the bowie-knife of Phil Evans\ncould not scratch it, and Uncle Prudent could not explain its nature?\nSimply paper!\n\nFor some years this fabrication had been making considerable\nprogress. Unsized paper, with the sheets impregnated with dextrin and\nstarch and squeezed in hydraulic presses, will form a material as\nhard as steel. There are made of it pulleys, rails, and wagon-wheels,\nmuch more solid than metal wheels, and far lighter. And it was this\nlightness and solidity which Robur availed himself of in building his\naerial locomotive. Everything--framework, hull, houses, cabins--were\nmade of straw-paper turned hard as metal by compression, and--what\nwas not to be despised in an apparatus flying at great\nheights--incombustible. The different parts of the engines and the\nscrews were made of gelatinized fiber, which combined in sufficient\ndegree flexibility with resistance. This material could be used in\nevery form. It was insoluble in most gases and liquids, acids or\nessences, to say nothing of its insulating properties, and it proved\nmost valuable in the electric machinery of the \"Albatross.\"\n\nRobur, his mate Tom Turner, an engineer and two assistants, two\nsteersman and a cook--eight men all told--formed the crew of the\naeronef, and proved ample for all the maneuvers required in aerial\nnavigation. There were arms of the chase and of war; fishing\nappliances; electric lights; instruments of observation, compasses,\nand sextants for checking the course, thermometers for studying the\ntemperature, different barometers, some for estimating the heights\nattained, others for indicating the variations of atmospheric\npressure; a storm-glass for forecasting tempests; a small library; a\nportable printing press; a field-piece mounted on a pivot; breech\nloading and throwing a three-inch shell; a supply of powder, bullets,\ndynamite cartridges; a cooking-stove, warmed by currents from the\naccumulators; a stock of preserves, meats and vegetables sufficient\nto last for months. Such were the outfit and stores of the\naeronef--in addition to the famous trumpet.\n\nThere was besides a light india-rubber boat, insubmersible, which\ncould carry eight men on the surface of a river, a lake, or a calm\nsea.\n\nBut were there any parachutes in case of accident? No. Robur did not\nbelieve in accidents of that kind. The axes of the screws were\nindependent. The stoppage of a few would not affect the motion of the\nothers; and if only half were working, the \"Albatross\" could still\nkeep afloat in her natural element.\n\n\"And with her,\" said Robur to his guests--guests in spite of\nthemselves--\"I am master of the seventh part of the world, larger\nthan Africa, Oceania, Asia, America, and Europe, this aerial Icarian\nsea, which millions of Icarians will one day people.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter VIII\n\nTHE BALLOONISTS REFUSE TO BE CONVINCED\n\n\nThe President of the Weldon Institute was stupefied; his companion\nwas astonished. But neither of them would allow any of their very\nnatural amazement to be visible.\n\nThe valet Frycollin did not conceal his terror at finding himself\nborne through space on such a machine, and he took no pains whatever\nto hide it.\n\nThe suspensory screws were rapidly spinning overhead. Fast as they\nwere going, they would have to triple their speed if the \"Albatross\"\nwas to ascend to higher zones. The two propellers were running very\neasily and driving the ship at about eleven knots an hour.\n\nAs they leaned over the rail the passengers of the \"Albatross\" could\nperceive a long sinuous liquid ribbon which meandered like a mere\nbrook through a varied country amid the gleaming of many lagoons\nobliquely struck by the rays of the sun. The brook was a river, one\nof the most important in that district. Along its left bank was a\nchain of mountains extending out of sight.\n\n\"And will you tell us where we are?\" asked Uncle Prudent, in a voice\ntremulous with anger.\n\n\"I have nothing to teach you,\" answered Robur.\n\n\"And will you tell us where we are going?\" asked Phil Evans.\n\n\"Through space.\"\n\n\"And how long will that last?\"\n\n\"Until it ends.\"\n\n\"Are we going round the world?\" asked Phil Evans ironically.\n\n\"Further than that,\" said Robur.\n\n\"And if this voyage does not suit us?\" asked Uncle Prudent.\n\n\"It will have to suit you.\"\n\nThat is a foretaste of the nature of the relations that were to\nobtain between the master of the \"Albatross\" and his guests, not to\nsay his prisoners. Manifestly he wished to give them time to cool\ndown, to admire the marvelous apparatus which was bearing them\nthrough the air, and doubtless to compliment the inventor. And so he\nwent off to the other end of the deck, leaving them to examine the\narrangement of the machinery and the management of the ship or to\ngive their whole attention to the landscape which was unrolling\nbeneath them.\n\n\"Uncle Prudent,\" said Evans, \"unless I am mistaken we are flying over\nCentral Canada. That river in the northwest is the St. Lawrence. That\ntown we are leaving behind is Quebec.\"\n\nIt was indeed the old city of Champlain, whose zinc roofs were\nshining like reflectors in the sun. The \"Albatross\" must thus have\nreached the forty-sixth degree of north latitude, and thus was\nexplained the premature advance of the day with the abnormal\nprolongation of the dawn.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Phil Evans, \"There is the town in its amphitheater, the\nhill with its citadel, the Gibraltar of North America. There are the\ncathedrals. There is the Custom House with its dome surmounted by the\nBritish flag!\"\n\nPhil Evans had not finished before the Canadian city began to slip\ninto the distance.\n\nThe clipper entered a zone of light clouds, which gradually shut off\na view of the ground.\n\nRobur, seeing that the president and secretary of the Weldon\nInstitute had directed their attention to the external arrangements\nof the \"Albatross,\" walked up to them and said: \"Well, gentlemen, do\nyou believe in the possibility of aerial locomotion by machines\nheavier than air?\"\n\nIt would have been difficult not to succumb to the evidence. But\nUncle Prudent and Phil Evans did not reply.\n\n\"You are silent,\" continued the engineer. \"Doubtless hunger makes you\ndumb! But if I undertook to carry you through the air, I did not\nthink of feeding you on such a poorly nutritive fluid. Your first\nbreakfast is waiting for you.\"\n\nAs Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans were feeling the pangs of hunger\nsomewhat keenly they did not care to stand upon ceremony. A meal\nwould commit them to nothing; and when Robur put them back on the\nground they could resume full liberty of action.\n\nAnd so they followed into a small dining-room in the aftermost house.\nThere they found a well-laid table at which they could take their\nmeals during the voyage. There were different preserves; and, among\nother things, was a sort of bread made of equal parts of flour and\nmeat reduced to powder and worked together with a little lard, which\nboiled in water made excellent soup; and there were rashers of fried\nham, and for drink there was tea.\n\nNeither had Frycollin been forgotten. He was taken forward and there\nfound some strong soup made of this bread. In truth he had to be very\nhungry to eat at all, for his jaws shook with fear, and almost\nrefused to work. \"If it was to break! If it was to break!\" said the\nunfortunate Negro. Hence continual faintings. Only think! A fall of\nover four thousand feet, which would smash him to a jelly!\n\nAn hour afterwards Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans appeared on the deck.\nRobur was no longer there. At the stem the man at the wheel in his\nglass cage, his eyes fixed on the compass, followed imperturbably\nwithout hesitation the route given by the engineer.\n\nAs for the rest of the crew, breakfast probably kept them from their\nposts. An assistant engineer, examining the machinery, went from one\nhouse to the other.\n\nIf the speed of the ship was great the two colleagues could only\nestimate it imperfectly, for the \"Albatross\" had passed through the\ncloud zone which the sun showed some four thousand feet below.\n\n\"I can hardly believe it,\" said Phil Evans.\n\n\"Don't believe it!\" said Uncle Prudent. And going to the bow they\nlooked out towards the western horizon.\n\n\"Another town,\" said Phil Evans.\n\n\"Do you recognize it?\"\n\n\"Yes! It seems to me to be Montreal.\"\n\n\"Montreal? But we only left Quebec two hours ago!\"\n\n\"That proves that we must be going at a speed of seventy-five miles\nan hour.\"\n\nSuch was the speed of the aeronef; and if the passengers were not\ninconvenienced by it, it was because they were going with the wind.\nIn a calm such speed would have been difficult and the rate would\nhave sunk to that of an express. In a head-wind the speed would have\nbeen unbearable.\n\nPhil Evans was not mistaken. Below the \"Albatross\" appeared Montreal,\neasily recognizable by the Victoria Bridge, a tubular bridge thrown\nover the St. Lawrence like the railway viaduct over the Venice\nlagoon. Soon they could distinguish the town's wide streets, its huge\nshops, its palatial banks, its cathedral, recently built on the model\nof St. Peter's at Rome, and then Mount Royal, which commands the city\nand forms a magnificent park.\n\nLuckily Phil Evans had visited the chief towns of Canada, and could\nrecognize them without asking Robur. After Montreal they passed\nOttawa, whose falls, seen from above, looked like a vast cauldron in\nebullition, throwing off masses of steam with grand effect.\n\n\"There is the Parliament House.\"\n\nAnd he pointed out a sort of Nuremburg toy planted on a hill top.\nThis toy with its polychrome architecture resembled the House of\nParliament in London much as the Montreal cathedral resembles St.\nPeter's at Rome. But that was of no consequence; there could be no\ndoubt it was Ottawa.\n\nSoon the city faded off towards the horizon, and formed but a\nluminous spot on the ground.\n\nIt was almost two hours before Robur appeared. His mate, Tom Turner,\naccompanied him. He said only three words. These were transmitted to\nthe two assistant engineers in the fore and aft engine-houses. At a\nsign the helmsman changed the-direction of the \"Albatross\" a couple\nof points to the southwest; at the same time Uncle Prudent and Phil\nEvans felt that a greater speed had been given to the propellers.\n\nIn fact, the speed had been doubled, and now surpassed anything that\nhad ever been attained by terrestrial Engines. Torpedo-boats do their\ntwenty-two knots an hour; railway trains do their sixty miles an\nhour; the ice-boats on the frozen Hudson do their sixty-five miles an\nhour; a machine built by the Patterson company, with a cogged wheel,\nhas done its eighty miles; and another locomotive between Trenton and\nJersey City has done its eighty-four.\n\nBut the \"Albatross,\" at full speed, could do her hundred and twenty\nmiles an hour, or 176 feet per second. This speed is that of the\nstorm which tears up trees by the roots. It is the mean speed of the\ncarrier pigeon, and is only surpassed by the flight of the swallow\n(220 feet per second) and that of the swift (274 feet per second).\n\nIn a word, as Robur had said, the \"Albatross,\" by using the whole\nforce of her screws, could make the tour of the globe in two hundred\nhours, or less than eight days.\n\nIs it necessary to say so? The phenomenon whose appearance had so\nmuch puzzled the people of both worlds was the aeronef of the\nengineer. The trumpet which blared its startling fanfares through the\nair was that of the mate, Tom Turner. The flag planted on the chief\nmonuments of Europe, Asia, America, was the flag of Robur the\nConqueror and his \"Albatross.\"\n\nAnd if up to then the engineer had taken many precautions against\nbeing recognized, if by preference he traveled at night, clearing the\nway with his electric lights, and during the day vanishing into the\nzones above the clouds, he seemed now to have no wish to keep his\nsecret hidden. And if he had come to Philadelphia and presented\nhimself at the meeting of the Weldon Institute, was it not that they\nmight share in his prodigious discovery, and convince \"ipso facto\"\nthe most incredulous? We know how he had been received, and we see\nwhat reprisals he had taken on the president and secretary of the\nclub.\n\nAgain did Robur approach his prisoners, who affected to be in no way\nsurprised at what they saw, of what had succeeded in spite of them.\nEvidently beneath the cranium of these two Anglo-Saxon heads there\nwas a thick crust of obstinacy, which would not be easy to remove.\n\nOn his part, Robur did not seem to notice anything particular, and\ncoolly continued the conversation which he had begun two hours before.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"you ask yourselves doubtless if this\napparatus, so marvelously adapted for aerial locomotion, is\nsusceptible of receiving greater speed. It is not worth while to\nconquer space if we cannot devour it. I wanted the air to be a solid\nsupport to me, and it is. I saw that to struggle against the wind I\nmust be stronger than the wind, and I am. I had no need of sails to\ndrive me, nor oars nor wheels to push me, nor rails to give me a\nfaster road. Air is what I wanted, that was all. Air surrounds me as\nit surrounds the submarine boat, and in it my propellers act like the\nscrews of a steamer. That is how I solved the problem of aviation.\nThat is what a balloon will never do, nor will any machine that is\nlighter than air.\"\n\nSilence, absolute, on the part of the colleagues, which did not for a\nmoment disconcert the engineer. He contented himself with a\nhalf-smile, and continued in his interrogative style, \"Perhaps you\nask if to this power of the \"Albatross\" to move horizontally there is\nadded an equal power of vertical movement--in a word, if, when, we\nvisit the higher zones of the atmosphere, we can compete with an\naerostat? Well, I should not advise you to enter the \"Go-Ahead\"\nagainst her!\"\n\nThe two colleagues shrugged their shoulders. That was probably what\nthe engineer was waiting for.\n\nRobur made a sign. The propelling screws immediately stopped, and\nafter running for a mile the \"Albatross\" pulled up motionless.\n\nAt a second gesture from Robur the suspensory helices revolved at a\nspeed that can only be compared to that of a siren in acoustical\nexperiments. Their f-r-r-r-r rose nearly an octave in the scale of\nsound, diminishing gradually in intensity as the air became more\nrarified, and the machine rose vertically, like a lark singing his\nsong in space.\n\n\"Master! Master!\" shouted Frycollin. \"See that it doesn't break!\"\n\nA smile of disdain was Robur's only reply. In a few minutes the\n\"Albatross\" had attained the height of 8,700 feet, and extended the\nrange of vision by seventy miles, the barometer having fallen 480\nmillimeters.\n\nThen the \"Albatross\" descended. The diminution of the pressure in\nhigh altitudes leads to the diminution of oxygen in the air, and\nconsequently in the blood. This has been the cause of several serious\naccidents which have happened to aeronauts, and Robur saw no reason\nto run any risk.\n\nThe \"Albatross\" thus returned to the height she seemed to prefer, and\nher propellers beginning again, drove her off to the southwest.\n\n\"Now, sirs, if that is what you wanted you can reply.\" Then, leaning\nover the rail, he remained absorbed in contemplation.\n\nWhen he raised his head the president and secretary of the Weldon\nInstitute stood by his side.\n\n\"Engineer Robur,\" said Uncle Prudent, in vain endeavoring to control\nhimself, \"we have nothing to ask about what you seem to believe, but\nwe wish to ask you a question which we think you would do well to\nanswer.\"\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"By what right did you attack us in Philadelphia in Fairmount Park?\nBy what right did you shut us up in that prison? By what right have\nyou brought us against our will on board this flying machine?\"\n\n\"And by what right, Messieurs Balloonists, did you insult and\nthreaten me in your club in such a way that I am astonished I came\nout of it alive?\"\n\n\"To ask is not to answer,\" said Phil Evans, \"and I repeat, by what\nright?\"\n\n\"Do you wish to know?\"\n\n\"If you please.\"\n\n\"Well, by the right of the strongest!\"\n\n\"That is cynical.\"\n\n\"But it is true.\"\n\n\"And for how long, citizen engineer,\" asked Uncle Prudent, who was\nnearly exploding, \"for how long do you intend to exercise that right?\"\n\n\"How can you?\" said Robur, ironically, \"how can you ask me such a\nquestion when you have only to cast down your eyes to enjoy a\nspectacle unparalleled in the world?\"\n\nThe \"Albatross\" was then sweeping across the immense expanse of Lake\nOntario. She had just crossed the country so poetically described by\nCooper. Then she followed the southern shore and headed for the\ncelebrated river which pours into it the waters of Lake Erie,\nbreaking them to powder in its cataracts.\n\nIn an instant a majestic sound, a roar as of the tempest, mounted\ntowards them and, as if a humid fog had been projected into the air,\nthe atmosphere sensibly freshened. Below were the liquid masses. They\nseemed like an enormous flowing sheet of crystal amid a thousand\nrainbows due to refraction as it decomposed the solar rays. The sight\nwas sublime.\n\nBefore the falls a foot-bridge, stretching like a thread, united one\nbank to the other. Three miles below was a suspension-bridge, across\nwhich a train was crawling from the Canadian to the American bank.\n\n\"The falls of Niagara!\" exclaimed Phil Evans. And as the exclamation\nescaped him, Uncle Prudent was doing all could do to admire nothing\nof these wonders.\n\nA minute afterwards the \"Albatross\" had crossed the river which\nseparates the United States from Canada, and was flying over the vast\nterritories of the West.\n\n\n\n\nChapter IX\n\nACROSS THE PRAIRIE\n\n\nIn one, of the cabins of the after-house Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans\nhad found two excellent berths, with clean linen, change of clothes,\nand traveling-cloaks and rugs. No Atlantic liner could have offered\nthem more comfort. If they did not sleep soundly it was that they did\nnot wish to do so, or rather that their very real anxiety prevented\nthem. In what adventure had they embarked? To what series of\nexperiments had they been invited? How would the business end? And\nabove all, what was Robur going to do with them?\n\nFrycollin, the valet, was quartered forward in a cabin adjoining that\nof the cook. The neighborhood did not displease him; he liked to rub\nshoulders with the great in this world. But if he finally went to\nsleep it was to dream of fall after fall, of projections through\nspace, which made his sleep a horrible nightmare.\n\nHowever, nothing could be quieter than this journey through the\natmosphere, whose currents had grown weaker with the evening. Beyond\nthe rustling of the blades of the screws there was not a sound,\nexcept now and then the whistle from some terrestrial locomotive, or\nthe calling of some animal. Strange instinct! These terrestrial\nbeings felt the aeronef glide over them, and uttered cries of terror\nas it passed. On the morrow, the 14th of June, at five o'clock, Uncle\nPrudent and Phil Evans were walking on the deck of the \"Albatross.\"\n\nNothing had changed since the evening; there was a lookout forward,\nand the helmsman was in his glass cage. Why was there a look-out? Was\nthere any chance of collision with another such machine? Certainly\nnot. Robur had not yet found imitators. The chance of encountering an\naerostat gliding through the air was too remote to be regarded. In\nany case it would be all the worse for the aerostat--the earthen pot\nand the iron pot. The \"Albatross\" had nothing to fear from the\ncollision.\n\nBut what could happen? The aeronef might find herself like a ship on\na lee shore if a mountain that could not be outflanked or passed\nbarred the way. These are the reefs of the air, and they have to be\navoided as a ship avoids the reefs of the sea. The engineer, it is\ntrue, had given the course, and in doing so had taken into account\nthe altitude necessary to clear the summits of the high lands in the\ndistrict. But as the aeronef was rapidly nearing a mountainous\ncountry, it was only prudent to keep a good lookout, in case some\nslight deviation from the course became necessary.\n\nLooking at the country beneath them, Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans\nnoticed a large lake, whose lower southern end the \"Albatross\" had\njust reached. They concluded, therefore, that during the night the\nwhole length of Lake Erie had been traversed, and that, as they were\ngoing due west, they would soon be over Lake Michigan. \"There can be\nno doubt of it,\" said Phil Evans, \"and that group of roofs on the\nhorizon is Chicago.\"\n\nHe was right. It was indeed the city from which the seventeen\nrailways diverge, the Queen of the West, the vast reservoir into\nwhich flow the products of Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, Missouri, and\nall the States which form the western half of the Union.\n\nUncle Prudent, through an excellent telescope he had found in his\ncabin, easily recognized the principal buildings. His colleague\npointed out to him the churches and public edifices, the numerous\n\"elevators\" or mechanical, granaries, and the huge Sherman Hotel,\nwhose windows seemed like a hundred glittering points on each of its\nfaces.\n\n\"If that is Chicago,\" said Uncle Prudent, \"it is obvious that we are\ngoing farther west than is convenient for us if we are to return to\nour starting-place.\"\n\nAnd, in fact, the \"Albatross\" was traveling in a straight line from\nthe Pennsylvania capital.\n\nBut if Uncle Prudent wished to ask Robur to take him eastwards he\ncould not then do so. That morning the engineer did not leave his\ncabin. Either he was occupied in some work, or else he was asleep,\nand the two colleagues sat down to breakfast without seeing him.\n\nThe speed was the same as that during last evening. The wind being\neasterly the rate was not interfered with at all, and as the\nthermometer only falls a degree centigrade for every seventy meters\nof elevation the temperature was not insupportable. And so, in\nchatting and thinking and waiting for the engineer, Uncle Prudent and\nPhil Evans walked about beneath the forest of screws, whose gyratory\nmovement gave their arms the appearance of semi-diaphanous disks.\n\nThe State of Illinois was left by its northern frontier in less than\ntwo hours and a half; and they crossed the Father of Waters, the\nMississippi, whose double-decked steam-boats seemed no bigger than\ncanoes. Then the \"Albatross\" flew over Iowa after having sighted Iowa\nCity about eleven o'clock in the morning.\n\nA few chains of hills, \"bluffs\" as they are called, curved across the\nface of the country trending from the south to the northwest, whose\nmoderate height necessitated no rise in the course of the aeronef.\nSoon the bluffs gave place to the large plains of western Iowa and\nNebraska--immense prairies extending all the way to the foot of the\nRocky Mountains. Here and there were many rios, affluents or minor\naffluents of the Missouri. On their banks were towns and villages,\ngrowing more scattered as the \"Albatross\" sped farther west.\n\nNothing particular happened during this day. Uncle Prudent and Phil\nEvans were left entirely to themselves. They hardly noticed Frycollin\nsprawling at full length in the bow, keeping his eyes shut so that he\ncould see nothing. And they were not attacked by vertigo, as might\nhave been expected. There was no guiding mark, and there was nothing\nto cause the vertigo, as there would have been on the top of a lofty\nbuilding. The abyss has no attractive power when it is gazed at from\nthe car of a balloon or deck of an aeronef. It is not an abyss that\nopens beneath the aeronaut, but an horizon that rises round him on\nall sides like a cup.\n\nIn a couple of hours the \"Albatross\" was over Omaha, on the Nebraskan\nfrontier--Omaha City, the real head of the Pacific Railway, that\nlong line of rails, four thousand five hundred miles in length,\nstretching from New York to San Francisco. For a moment they could\nsee the yellow waters of the Missouri, then the town, with its houses\nof wood and brick in the center of a rich basin, like a buckle in the\niron belt which clasps North America round the waist. Doubtless,\nalso, as the passengers in the aeronef could observe all these\ndetails, the inhabitants of Omaha noticed the strange machine. Their\nastonishment at seeing it gliding overhead could be no greater than\nthat of the president and secretary of the Weldon Institute at\nfinding themselves on board.\n\nAnyhow, the journals of the Union would be certain to notice the\nfact. It would be the explanation of the astonishing phenomenon which\nthe whole world had been wondering over for some time.\n\nIn an hour the \"Albatross\" had left Omaha and crossed the Platte\nRiver, whose valley is followed by the Pacific Railway in its route\nacross the prairie. Things looked serious for Uncle Prudent and Phil\nEvans.\n\n\"It is serious, then, this absurd project of taking us to the\nAntipodes.\"\n\n\"And whether we like it or not!\" exclaimed the other.\n\n\"Robur had better take care! I am not the man to stand that sort of\nthing.\"\n\n\"Nor am I!\" replied Phil Evans. \"But be calm, Uncle Prudent, be calm.\"\n\n\"Be calm!\"\n\n\"And keep your temper until it is wanted.\"\n\nBy five o'clock they had crossed the Black Mountains covered with\npines and cedars, and the \"Albatross\" was over the appropriately\nnamed Bad Lands of Nebraska--a chaos of ochre-colored hills, of\nmountainous fragments fallen on the soil and broken in their fall. At\na distance these blocks take the most fantastic shapes. Here and\nthere amid this enormous game of knucklebones there could be traced\nthe imaginary ruins of medieval cities with forts and dungeons,\npepper-box turrets, and machicolated towers. And in truth these Bad\nLands are an immense ossuary where lie bleaching in the sun myriads\nof fragments of pachyderms, chelonians, and even, some would have us\nbelieve, fossil men, overwhelmed by unknown cataclysms ages and ages\nago.\n\nWhen evening came the whole basin of the Platte River had been\ncrossed, and the plain extended to the extreme limits of the horizon,\nwhich rose high owing to the altitude of the \"Albatross.\"\n\nDuring the night there were no more shrill whistles of locomotives or\ndeeper notes of the river steamers to trouble the quiet of the starry\nfirmament. Long bellowing occasionally reached the aeronef from the\nherds of buffalo that roamed over the prairie in search of water and\npasturage. And when they ceased, the trampling of the grass under\ntheir feet produced a dull roaring similar to the rushing of a flood,\nand very different from the continuous f-r-r-r-r of the screws.\n\nThen from time to time came the howl of a wolf, a fox, a wild cat, or\na coyote, the \"Canis latrans,\" whose name is justified by his\nsonorous bark.\n\nOccasionally came penetrating odors of mint, and sage, and absinthe,\nmingled with the more powerful fragrance of the conifers which rose\nfloating through the night air.\n\nAt last came a menacing yell, which was not due to the coyote. It was\nthe shout of a Redskin, which no Tenderfoot would confound with the\ncry of a wild beast.\n\n\n\n\nChapter X\n\nWESTWARD--BUT WHITHER?\n\n\nThe next day, the 15th of June, about five o'clock in the morning,\nPhil Evans left his cabin. Perhaps he would today have a chance of\nspeaking to Robur? Desirous of knowing why he had not appeared the\nday before, Evans addressed himself to the mate, Tom Turner.\n\nTom Turner was an Englishman of about forty-five, broad in the\nshoulders and short in the legs, a man of iron, with one of those\nenormous characteristic heads that Hogarth rejoiced in.\n\n\"Shall we see Mr. Robur to-day?\" asked Phil Evans.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Turner.\n\n\"I need not ask if he has gone out.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he has.\"\n\n\"And when will he come back?\"\n\n\"When he has finished his cruise.\"\n\nAnd Tom went into his cabin.\n\nWith this reply they had to be contented. Matters did not look\npromising, particularly as on reference to the compass it appeared\nthat the \"Albatross\" was still steering southwest.\n\nGreat was the contrast between the barren tract of the Bad Lands\npassed over during the night and the landscape then unrolling beneath\nthem.\n\nThe aeronef was now more than six hundred miles from Omaha, and over\na country which Phil Evans could not recognize because he had never\nbeen there before. A few forts to keep the Indians in order crowned\nthe bluffs with their geometric lines, formed oftener of palisades\nthan walls. There were few villages, and few inhabitants, the country\ndiffering widely from the auriferous lands of Colorado many leagues\nto the south.\n\nIn the distance a long line of mountain crests, in great confusion as\nyet, began to appear. They were the Rocky Mountains.\n\nFor the first time that morning Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans were\nsensible of a certain lowness of temperature which was not due to a\nchange in the weather, for the sun shone in superb splendor.\n\n\"It is because of the \"Albatross\" being higher in the air,\" said Phil\nEvans.\n\nIn fact the barometer outside the central deck-house had fallen 540\nmillimeters, thus indicating an elevation of about 10,000 feet above\nthe sea. The aeronef was at this altitude owing to the elevation of\nthe ground. An hour before she had been at a height of 13,000 feet,\nand behind her were mountains covered with perpetual snow.\n\nThere was nothing Uncle Prudent and his companion could remember\nwhich would lead them to discover where they were. During the night\nthe \"Albatross\" had made several stretches north and south at\ntremendous speed, and that was what had put them out of their\nreckoning.\n\nAfter talking over several hypotheses more or less plausible they\ncame to the conclusion that this country encircled with mountains\nmust be the district declared by an Act of Congress in March, 1872,\nto be the National Park of the United States. A strange region it\nwas. It well merited the name of a park--a park with mountains for\nhills, with lakes for ponds, with rivers for streamlets, and with\ngeysers of marvelous power instead of fountains.\n\nIn a few minutes the \"Albatross\" glided across the Yellowstone River,\nleaving Mount Stevenson on the right, and coasting the large lake\nwhich bears the name of the stream. Great was the variety on the\nbanks of this basin, ribbed as they were with obsidian and tiny\ncrystals, reflecting the sunlight on their myriad facets. Wonderful\nwas the arrangement of the islands on its surface; magnificent were\nthe blue reflections of the gigantic mirror. And around the lake, one\nof the highest in the globe, were multitudes of pelicans, swans,\ngulls and geese, bernicles and divers. In places the steep banks were\nclothed with green trees, pines and larches, and at the foot of the\nescarpments there shot upwards innumerable white fumaroles, the vapor\nescaping from the soil as from an enormous reservoir in which the\nwater is kept in permanent ebullition by subterranean fire.\n\nThe cook might have seized the opportunity of securing an ample\nsupply of trout, the only fish the Yellowstone Lake contains in\nmyriads. But the \"Albatross\" kept on at such a height that there was\nno chance of indulging in a catch which assuredly would have been\nmiraculous.\n\nIn three quarters of an hour the lake was overpassed, and a little\nfarther on the last was seen of the geyser region, which rivals the\nfinest in Iceland. Leaning over the rail, Uncle Prudent and Phil\nEvans watched the liquid columns which leaped up as though to furnish\nthe aeronef with a new element. There were the Fan, with the jets\nshot forth in rays, the Fortress, which seemed to be defended by\nwaterspouts, the Faithful Friend, with her plume crowned with the\nrainbows, the Giant, spurting forth a vertical torrent twenty feet\nround and more than two hundred feet high.\n\nRobur must evidently have been familiar with this incomparable\nspectacle, unique in the world, for he did not appear on deck. Was\nit, then, for the sole pleasure of his guests that he had brought the\naeronef above the national domain? If so, he came not to receive\ntheir thanks. He did not even trouble himself during the daring\npassage of the Rocky Mountains, which the \"Albatross\" approached at\nabout seven o'clock.\n\nBy increasing the speed of her wings, as a bird rising in its flight,\nthe \"Albatross\" would clear the highest ridges of the chain, and sink\nagain over Oregon or Utah, But the maneuver was unnecessary. The\npasses allowed the barrier to be crossed without ascending for the\nhigher ridges. There are many of these canyons, or steep valleys,\nmore or less narrow, through which they could glide, such as Bridger\nGap, through which runs the Pacific Railway into the Mormon\nterritory, and others to the north and south of it.\n\nIt was through one of these that the \"Albatross\" headed, after\nslackening speed so as not to dash against the walls of the canyon.\nThe steersman, with a sureness of hand rendered more effective by the\nsensitiveness of the rudder, maneuvered his craft as if she were a\ncrack racer in a Royal Victoria match. It was really extraordinary.\nIn spite of all the jealousy of the two enemies of \"lighter than\nair,\" they could not help being surprised at the perfection of this\nengine of aerial locomotion.\n\nIn less than two hours and a half they were through the Rockies, and\nthe \"Albatross\" resumed her former speed of sixty-two miles an hour.\nShe was steering southwest so as to cut across Utah diagonally as she\nneared the ground. She had even dropped several hundred yards when\nthe sound of a whistle attracted the attention of Uncle Prudent and\nPhil Evans. It was a train on the Pacific Railway on the road to Salt\nLake City.\n\nAnd then, in obedience to an order secretly given, the \"Albatross\"\ndropped still lower so as to chase the train, which was going at full\nspeed. She was immediately sighted. A few heads showed themselves at\nthe doors of the cars. Then numerous passengers crowded the gangways.\nSome did not hesitate to climb on the roof to get a better view of\nthe flying machine. Cheers came floating up through the air; but no\nRobur appeared in answer to them.\n\nThe \"Albatross\" continued her descent, slowing her suspensory screws\nand moderating her speed so as not to leave the train behind. She\nflew about it like an enormous beetle or a gigantic bird of prey. She\nheaded off, to the right and left, and swept on in front, and hung\nbehind, and proudly displayed her flag with the golden sun, to which\nthe conductor of the train replied by waving the Stars and Stripes.\n\nIn vain the prisoners, in their desire to take advantage of the\nopportunity, endeavored to make themselves known to those below. In\nvain the president of the Weldon Institute roared forth at the top of\nhis voice, \"I am Uncle Prudent of Philadelphia!\" And the secretary\nfollowed suit with, \"I am Phil Evans, his colleague!\" Their shouts\nwere lost in the thousand cheers with which the passengers greeted\nthe aeronef.\n\nThree or four of the crew of the \"Albatross\" had appeared on the\ndeck, and one of them, like sailors when passing a ship less speedy\nthan their own, held out a rope, an ironical way of offering to tow\nthem.\n\nAnd then the \"Albatross\" resumed her original speed, and in half an\nhour the express was out of sight. About one o'clock there appeared a\nvast disk, which reflected the solar rays as if it were an immense\nmirror.\n\n\"That ought to be the Mormon capital, Salt Lake City,\" said Uncle\nPrudent. And so it was, and the disk was the roof of the Tabernacle,\nwhere ten thousand saints can worship at their ease. This vast dome,\nlike a convex mirror, threw off the rays of the sun in all directions.\n\nIt vanished like a shadow, and the \"Albatross\" sped on her way to the\nsouthwest with a speed that was not felt, because it surpassed that\nof the chasing wind. Soon she was in Nevada over the silver regions,\nwhich the Sierra separates from the golden lands of California.\n\n\"We shall certainly reach San Francisco before night,\" said Phil\nEvans.\n\n\"And then?\" asked Uncle Prudent.\n\nIt was six o'clock precisely when the Sierra Nevada was crossed by\nthe same pass as that taken by the railway. Only a hundred and eighty\nmiles then separated them from San Francisco, the Californian capital.\n\nAt the speed the \"Albatross\" was going she would be over the dome by\neight o'clock.\n\nAt this moment Robur appeared on deck. The colleagues walked up to\nhim.\n\n\"Engineer Robur,\" said Uncle Prudent, \"we are now on the very\nconfines of America! We think the time has come for this joke to end.\"\n\n\"I never joke,\" said Robur.\n\nHe raised his hand. The \"Albatross\" swiftly dropped towards the\nground, and at the same time such speed was given her as to drive the\nprisoners into their cabin. As soon as the door was shut, Uncle\nPrudent exclaimed,\n\n\"I could strangle him!\"\n\n\"We must try to escape.\" said Phil Evans.\n\n\"Yes; cost what it may!\"\n\nA long murmur greeted their ears. It was the beating of the surf on\nthe seashore. It was the Pacific Ocean!\n\n\n\n\nChapter XI\n\nTHE WIDE PACIFIC\n\n\nUncle Prudent and Phil Evans had quite made up their minds to escape.\nIf they had not had to deal with the eight particularly vigorous men\nwho composed the crew of the aeronef they might have tried to succeed\nby main force. But as they were only two--for Frycollin could only\nbe considered as a quantity of no importance--force was not to be\nthought of. Hence recourse must be had to strategy as soon as the\n\"Albatross\" again took the ground. Such was what Phil Evans\nendeavored to impress on his irascible colleague, though he was in\nconstant fear of Prudent aggravating matters by some premature\noutbreak.\n\nIn any case the present was not the time to attempt anything of the\nsort. The aeronef was sweeping along over the North Pacific. On the\nfollowing morning, that of June 16th, the coast was out of sight. And\nas the coast curves off from Vancouver Island up to the\nAleutians--belonging to that portion of America ceded by Russia to\nthe United States in 1867--it was highly probable that the \"Albatross\"\nwould cross it at the end of the curve, if her course remained\nunchanged.\n\nHow long the night appeared to be to the two friends! How eager they\nwere to get out of their cabins! When they came on deck in the\nmorning the dawn had for some hours been silvering the eastern\nhorizon. They were nearing the June solstice, the longest day of the\nyear in the northern hemisphere, when there is hardly any night along\nthe sixtieth parallel.\n\nEither from custom or intention Robur was in no hurry to leave his\ndeck-house, When he came out this morning be contented himself with\nbowing to his two guests as he passed them in the stern of the\naeronef.\n\nAnd now Frycollin ventured out of his cabin. His eyes red with\nsleeplessness, and dazed in their look, he tottered along, like a man\nwhose foot feels it is not on solid ground. His first glance was at\nthe suspensory screws, which were working with gratifying regularity\nwithout any signs of haste. That done, the Negro stumbled along to\nthe rail, and grasped it with both hands, so as to make sure of his\nbalance. Evidently he wished to view the country over which the\n\"Albatross\" was flying at the height of seven hundred feet or more.\n\nAt first he kept himself well back behind the rail. Then he shook it\nto make sure it was firm; then he drew himself up; then he bent\nforward; then he stretched out his head. It need not be said that\nwhile he was executing these different maneuvers he kept his eyes\nshut. At last he opened them.\n\nWhat a shout! And how quickly he fled! And how deeply his head sank\nback into his shoulders! At the bottom of the abyss he had seen the\nimmense ocean. His hair would have risen on end--if it had not been\nwool.\n\n\"The sea! The sea!\" he cried. And Frycollin would have fallen on the\ndeck had not the cook opened his arms to receive him.\n\nThis cook was a Frenchman, and probably a Gascon, his name being\nFrancois Tapage. If he was not a Gascon he must in his infancy have\ninhaled the breezes of the Garonne. How did this Francois Tapage find\nhimself in the service of the engineer? By what chain of accidents\nhad he become one of the crew of the \"Albatross?\" We can hardly say;\nbut in any case be spoke English like a Yankee. \"Eh, stand up!\" he\nsaid, lifting the Negro by a vigorous clutch at the waist.\n\n\"Master Tapage!\" said the poor fellow, giving a despairing look at\nthe screws.\n\n\"At your service, Frycollin.\"\n\n\"Did this thing ever smash?\"\n\n\"No, but it will end by smashing.\"\n\n\"Why? Why?\"\n\n\"Because everything must end.\n\n\"And the sea is beneath us!\"\n\n\"If we are to fall, it is better to fall in the sea.\"\n\n\"We shall be drowned.\"\n\n\"We shall be drowned, but we shall not be smashed to a jelly.\"\n\nThe next moment Frycollin was on all fours, creeping to the back of\nhis cabin.\n\nDuring this day the aeronef was only driven at moderate speed. She\nseemed to skim the placid surface of the sea, which lay beneath.\nUncle Prudent and his companion remained in their cabin, so that they\ndid not meet with Robur, who walked about smoking alone or talking to\nthe mate. Only half the screws were working, yet that was enough to\nkeep the apparatus afloat in the lower zones of the atmosphere.\n\nThe crew, as a change from the ordinary routine, would have\nendeavored to catch a few fish had there been any sign of them; but\nall that could be seen on the surface of the sea were a few of those\nyellow-bellied whales which measure about eighty feet in length.\nThese are the most formidable cetaceans in the northern seas, and\nwhalers are very careful in attacking them, for their strength is\nprodigious. However, in harpooning one of these whales, either with\nthe ordinary harpoon, the Fletcher fuse, or the javelin-bomb, of\nwhich there was an assortment on board, there would have been danger\nto the men of the \"Albatross.\"\n\nBut what was the good of such useless massacre? Doubtless to show off\nthe powers of the aeronef to the members of the Weldon Institute. And\nso Robur gave orders for the capture of one of these monstrous\ncetaceans.\n\nAt the shout of \"A whale! A whale!\" Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans\ncame out of their cabin. Perhaps there was a whaler in sight! In that\ncase all they had to do to escape from their flying prison was to\njump into the sea, and chance being picked up by the vessel.\n\nThe crew were all on deck. \"Shall we try, sir?\" asked Tom Turner.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Robur.\n\nIn the engine-room the engineer and his assistant were at their posts\nready to obey the orders signaled to them. The \"Albatross\" dropped\ntowards the sea, and remained, about fifty feet above it.\n\nThere was no ship in sight--of that the two colleagues soon assured\nthemselves--nor was there any land to be seen to which they could\nswim, providing Robur made no attempt to recapture them.\n\nSeveral jets of water from the spout holes soon announced the\npresence of the whales as they came to the surface to breathe. Tom\nTurner and one of the men were in the bow. Within his reach was one\nof those javelin-bombs, of Californian make, which are shot from an\narquebus and which are shaped as a metallic cylinder terminated by a\ncylindrical shell armed with a shaft having a barbed point. Robur was\na little farther aft, and with his right hand signaled to the\nengineers, while with his left, he directed the steersman. He thus\ncontrolled the aeronef in every way, horizontally and vertically, and\nit is almost impossible to conceive with what speed and precision the\n\"Albatross\" answered to his orders. She seemed a living being, of\nwhich he was the soul.\n\n\"A whale! A whale!\" shouted Tom Turner, as the back of a cetacean\nemerged from the surface about four cable-lengths in front of the\n\"Albatross.\"\n\nThe \"Albatross\" swept towards it, and when she was within sixty feet\nof it she stopped dead.\n\nTom Turner seized the arquebus, which was resting against a cleat on\nthe rail. He fired, and the projectile, attached to a long line,\nentered the whale's body. The shell, filled with an explosive\ncompound, burst, and shot out a small harpoon with two branches,\nwhich fastened into the animal's flesh.\n\n\"Look out!\" shouted Turner.\n\nUncle Prudent and Phil Evans, much against their will, became greatly\ninterested in the spectacle.\n\nThe whale, seriously wounded, gave the sea such a slap with his tail,\nthat the water dashed up over the bow of the aeronef. Then he plunged\nto a great depth, while the line, which had been previously wetted in\na tub of water to prevent its taking fire, ran out like lightning.\nWhen the whale rose to the surface he started off at full speed in a\nnortherly direction.\n\nIt may be imagined with what speed the \"Albatross\" was towed in\npursuit. Besides, the propellers had been stopped. The whale was let\ngo as he would, and the ship followed him. Turner stood ready to cut\nthe line in case a fresh plunge should render this towing dangerous.\n\nFor half an hour, and perhaps for a distance of six miles, the\n\"Albatross\" was thus dragged along, but it was obvious that the whale\nwas tiring. Then, at a gesture from Robur the assistant engineers\nstarted the propellers astern, so as to oppose a certain resistance\nto the whale, who was gradually getting closer.\n\nSoon the aeronef was gliding about twenty-five feet above him. His\ntail was beating the waters with incredible violence, and as he\nturned over on his back an enormous wave was produced.\n\nSuddenly the whale turned up again, so as to take a header, as it\nwere, and then dived with such rapidity that Turner had barely time\nto cut the line.\n\nThe aeronef was dragged to the very surface of the water. A whirlpool\nwas formed where the animal had disappeared. A wave dashed up on to\nthe deck as if the aeronef were a ship driving against wind and tide.\n\nLuckily, with a blow of the hatchet the mate severed the line, and\nthe \"Albatross,\" freed from her tug, sprang aloft six hundred feet\nunder the impulse of her ascensional screws. Robur had maneuvered his\nship without losing his coolness for a moment.\n\nA few minutes afterwards the whale returned to the surface--dead.\nFrom every side the birds flew down on to the carcass, and their\ncries were enough to deafen a congress. The \"Albatross,\" without\nstopping to share in the spoil, resumed her course to the west.\n\nIn the morning of the 17th of June, at about six o'clock, land was\nsighted on the horizon. This was the peninsula of Alaska, and the\nlong range of breakers of the Aleutian Islands.\n\nThe \"Albatross\" glided over the barrier where the fur seals swarm\nfor the benefit of the Russo-American Company. An excellent business\nis the capture of these amphibians, which are from six to seven feet\nlong, russet in color, and weigh from three hundred to four hundred\npounds. There they were in interminable files, ranged in line of\nbattle, and countable by thousands.\n\nAlthough they did not move at the passage of the \"Albatross,\" it was\notherwise with the ducks, divers, and loons, whose husky cries filled\nthe air as they disappeared beneath the waves and fled terrified from\nthe aerial monster.\n\nThe twelve hundred miles of the Behring Sea between the first of the\nAleutians and the extreme end of Kamtschatka were traversed during\nthe twenty-four hours of this day and the following night. Uncle\nPrudent and Phil Evans found that here was no present chance of\nputting their project of escape into execution. Flight was not to be\nthought of among the deserts of Eastern Asia, nor on the coast of the\nsea of Okhotsk. Evidently the \"Albatross\" was bound for Japan or\nChina, and there, although it was not perhaps quite safe to trust\nthemselves to the mercies of the Chinese or Japanese, the two\nfriends had made up their minds to run if the aeronef stopped.\n\nBut would she stop? She was not like a bird which grows fatigued by\ntoo long a flight, or like a balloon which has to descend for want of\ngas. She still had food for many weeks and her organs were of\nmarvelous strength, defying all weakness and weariness.\n\nDuring the 18th of June she swept over the peninsula of Kamtschatka,\nand during the day there was a glimpse of Petropaulovski and the\nvolcano of Kloutschew. Then she rose again to cross the Sea of\nOkhotsk, running down by the Kurile Isles, which seemed to be a\nbreakwater pierced by hundreds of channels. On the 19th, in the\nmorning, the \"Albatross\" was over the strait of La Perouse between\nSaghalien and Northern Japan, and had reached the mouth of the great\nSiberian river, the Amoor.\n\nThen there came a fog so dense that the aeronef had to rise above it.\nAt the altitude she was there was no obstacle to be feared, no\nelevated monuments to hinder her passage, no mountains against which\nthere was risk of being shattered in her flight. The country was only\nslightly varied. But the fog was very disagreeable, and made\neverything on board very damp.\n\nAll that was necessary was to get above this bed of mist, which was\nnearly thirteen hundred feet thick, and the ascensional screws being\nincreased in speed, the \"Albatross\" was soon clear of the fog and in\nthe sunny regions of the sky. Under these circumstances, Uncle\nPrudent and Phil Evans would have found some difficulty in carrying\nout their plan of escape, even admitting that they could leave the\naeronef.\n\nDuring the day, as Robur passed them he stopped for a moment, and\nwithout seeming to attach any importance to what he said, addressed\nthem carelessly as follows: \"Gentlemen, a sailing-ship or a steamship\ncaught in a fog from which it cannot escape is always much delayed.\nIt must not move unless it keeps its whistle or its horn going. It\nmust reduce its speed, and any instant a collision may be expected.\nThe \"Albatross\" has none of these things to fear. What does fog\nmatter to her? She can leave it when she chooses. The whole of space\nis hers.\" And Robur continued his stroll without waiting for an\nanswer, and the puffs of his pipe were lost in the sky.\n\n\"Uncle Prudent,\" said Phil Evans, \"it seems that this astonishing\n\"Albatross\" never has anything to fear.\"\n\n\"That we shall see!\" answered the president of the Weldon Institute.\n\nThe fog lasted three days, the 19th, 20th, and 21st of June, with\nregrettable persistence. An ascent had to be made to clear the\nJapanese mountain of Fujiyama. When the curtain of mist was drawn\naside there lay below them an immense city, with palaces, villas,\ngardens, and parks. Even without seeing it Robur had recognized it by\nthe barking of the innumerable dogs, the cries of the birds of prey,\nand above all, by the cadaverous odor which the bodies of its\nexecuted criminals gave off into space.\n\nThe two colleagues were out on the deck while the engineer was taking\nhis observations in case he thought it best to continue his course\nthrough the fog.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"I have no reason for concealing from you that\nthis town is Tokyo, the capital of Japan.\"\n\nUncle Prudent did not reply. In the presence of the engineer he was\nalmost choked, as if his lungs were short of air.\n\n\"This view of Tokyo,\" continued Robur, \"is very curious.\"\n\n\"Curious as it may be--\" replied Phil Evans.\n\n\"It is not as good as Peking?\" interrupted the engineer.\n\n\"That is what I think, and very shortly you shall have an opportunity\nof judging.\"\n\nImpossible to be more agreeable!\n\nThe \"Albatross\" then gliding southeast, had her course changed four\npoints, so as to head to the eastward.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XII\n\nTHROUGH THE HIMALAYAS\n\n\nDuring the night the fog cleared off. There were symptoms of an\napproaching typhoon--a rapid fall of the barometer, a disappearance\nof vapor, large clouds of ellipsoid form clinging to a copper sky,\nand, on the opposite horizon, long streaks of carmine on a\nslate-colored field, with a large sector quite clear in the north.\nThen the sea was smooth and calm and at sunset assumed a deep scarlet\nhue.\n\nFortunately the typhoon broke more to the south, and had no other\nresult than to sweep away the mist which had been accumulating during\nthe last three days.\n\nIn an hour they had traversed the hundred and twenty-five miles of\nthe Korean strait, and while the typhoon was raging on the coast of\nChina, the \"Albatross\" was over the Yellow Sea. During the 22nd and\n23rd she was over the Gulf of Pechelee, and on the 24th she was\nascending the valley of the Peiho on her way to the capital of the\nCelestial Empire.\n\nLeaning over the rail, the two colleagues, as the engineer had told\nthem, could see distinctly the immense city, the wall which divides\nit into two parts--the Manchu town, and the Chinese town--the\ntwelve suburbs which surround it, the large boulevards which radiate\nfrom its center, the temples with their green and yellow roofs bathed\nin the rising sun, the grounds surrounding the houses of the\nmandarins; then in the middle of the Manchu town the eighteen hundred\nacres of the Yellow town, with its pagodas, its imperial gardens, its\nartificial lakes, its mountain of coal which towers above the\ncapital; and in the center of the Yellow town, like a square of\nChinese puzzle enclosed in another, the Red town, that is the\nimperial palace, with all the peaks of its outrageous architecture.\n\nBelow the \"Albatross\" the air was filled with a singular harmony. It\nseemed to be a concert of Aeolian harps. In the air were a hundred\nkites of different forms, made of sheets of palm-leaf, and having at\ntheir upper end a sort of bow of light wood with a thin slip of\nbamboo beneath. In the breath of the wind these slips, with all their\nnotes varied like those of a harmonicon, gave forth a most melancholy\nmurmuring. It seemed as though they were breathing musical oxygen.\n\nIt suited Robur's whim to run close up to this aerial orchestra, and\nthe \"Albatross\" slowed as she glided through the sonorous waves which\nthe kites gave off through the atmosphere.\n\nBut immediately an extraordinary effect was produced amongst the\ninnumerable population. Beatings of the tomtoms and sounds of other\nformidable instruments of the Chinese orchestra, gun reports by the\nthousand, mortars fired in hundreds, all were brought into play to\nscare away the aeronef. Although the Chinese astronomers may have\nrecognized the aerial machine as the moving body that had given rise\nto such disputes, it was to the Celestial million, from the humblest\ntankader to the best-buttoned mandarin, an apocalyptical monster\nappearing in the sky of Buddha.\n\nThe crew of the \"Albatross\" troubled themselves very little about\nthese demonstrations. But the strings which held the kites, and were\ntied to fixed pegs in the imperial gardens, were cut or quickly\nhauled in; and the kites were either drawn in rapidly, sounding\nlouder as they sank, or else fell like a bird shot through both\nwings, whose song ends with its last sigh.\n\nA noisy fanfare escaped from Tom Turner's trumpet, and drowned the\nfinal notes of the aerial concert. It did not interrupt the\nterrestrial fusillade. At last a shell exploded a few feet below the\n\"Albatross,\" and then she mounted into the inaccessible regions of\nthe sky.\n\nNothing happened during the few following days of which the prisoners\ncould take advantage. The aeronef kept on her course to the\nsouthwest, thereby showing that it was intended to take her to India.\nTwelve hours after leaving Peking, Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans\ncaught a glimpse of the Great Wall in the neighborhood of Chen-Si.\nThen, avoiding the Lung Mountains, they passed over the valley of the\nHoangho and crossed the Chinese border on the Tibet side.\n\nTibet consists of high table-lands without vegetation, with here and\nthere snowy peaks and barren ravines, torrents fed by glaciers,\ndepressions with glittering beds of salt, lakes surrounded by\nluxurious forests, with icy winds sweeping over all.\n\nThe barometer indicated an altitude of thirteen thousand feet above\nthe level of the sea. At that height the temperature, although it was\nin the warmest months of the northern hemisphere, was only a little\nabove freezing. This cold, combined with the speed of the\n\"Albatross,\" made the voyage somewhat trying, and although the\nfriends had warm traveling wraps, they preferred to keep to their\ncabin.\n\nIt need hardly be said that to keep the aeronef in this rarefied\natmosphere the suspensory screws had to be driven at extreme speed.\nBut they worked with perfect regularity, and the sound of their wings\nalmost acted as a lullaby.\n\nDuring this day, appearing from below about the size of a carrier\npigeon, she passed over Garlock, a town of western Tibet, the capital\nof the province of Cari Khorsum.\n\nOn the 27th of June, Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans sighted an enormous\nbarrier, broken here and there by several peaks, lost in the snows\nthat bounded the horizon.\n\nLeaning against the fore-cabin, so as to keep their places\nnotwithstanding the speed of the ship, they watched these colossal\nmasses, which seemed to be running away from the aeronef.\n\n\"The Himalayas, evidently,\" said Phil Evans; \"and probably Robur is\ngoing round their base, so as to pass into India.\"\n\n\"So much the worse,\" answered Uncle Prudent. \"On that immense\nterritory we shall perhaps be able to--\"\n\n\"Unless he goes round by Burma to the east, or Nepal to the west.\"\n\n\"Anyhow, I defy him to go through them.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said a voice.\n\nThe next day, the 28th of June, the \"Albatross\" was in front of the\nhuge mass above the province of Zang. On the other side of the chain\nwas the province of Nepal. These ranges block the road into India\nfrom the north. The two northern ones, between which the aeronef was\ngliding like a ship between enormous reefs are the first steps of the\nCentral Asian barrier. The first was the Kuen Lung, the other the\nKarakorum, bordering the longitudinal valley parallel to the\nHimalayas, from which the Indus flows to the west and the\nBrahmapootra to the east.\n\nWhat a superb orographical system! More than two hundred summits have\nbeen measured, seventeen of which exceed twenty-five thousand feet.\nIn front of the \"Albatross,\" at a height of twenty-nine thousand\nfeet, towered Mount Everest. To the right was Dhawalagiri, reaching\ntwenty-six thousand eight hundred feet, and relegated to second place\nsince the measurement of Mount Everest.\n\nEvidently Robur did not intend to go over the top of these peaks; but\nprobably he knew the passes of the Himalayas, among others that of\nIbi Ganim, which the brothers Schlagintweit traversed in 1856 at a\nheight of twenty-two thousand feet. And towards it he went.\n\nSeveral hours of palpitation, becoming quite painful, followed; and\nalthough the rarefaction of the air was not such as to necessitate\nrecourse being had to the special apparatus for renewing oxygen in\nthe cabins, the cold was excessive.\n\nRobur stood in the bow, his sturdy figure wrapped in a great-coat. He\ngave the orders, while Tom Turner was at the helm. The engineer kept\nan attentive watch on his batteries, the acid in which fortunately\nran no risk of congelation. The screws, running at the full strength\nof the current, gave forth a note of intense shrillness in spite of\nthe trifling density of the air. The barometer showed twenty-three\nthousand feet in altitude.\n\nMagnificent was the grouping of the chaos of mountains! Everywhere\nwere brilliant white summits. There were no lakes, but glaciers\ndescending ten thousand feet towards the base. There was no herbage,\nonly a few phanerogams on the limit of vegetable life. Down on the\nlower flanks of the range were splendid forests of pines and cedars.\nHere were none of the gigantic ferns and interminable parasites\nstretching from tree to tree as in the thickets of the jungle. There\nwere no animals--no wild horses, or yaks, or Tibetan bulls.\nOccasionally a scared gazelle showed itself far down the slopes.\nThere were no birds, save a couple of those crows which can rise to\nthe utmost limits of the respirable air.\n\nThe pass at last was traversed. The \"Albatross\" began to descend.\nComing from the hills out of the forest region there was now beneath\nthem an immense plain stretching far and wide.\n\nThen Robur stepped up to his guests, and in a pleasant voice\nremarked, \"India, gentlemen!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIII\n\nOVER THE CASPIAN\n\n\nThe engineer had no intention of taking his ship over the wondrous\nlands of Hindustan. To cross the Himalayas was to show how admirable\nwas the machine he commanded; to convince those who would not be\nconvinced was all he wished to do.\n\nBut if in their hearts Uncle Prudent and his colleague could not help\nadmiring so perfect an engine of aerial locomotion, they allowed none\nof their admiration to be visible. All they thought of was how to\nescape. They did not even admire the superb spectacle that lay\nbeneath them as the \"Albatross\" flew along the river banks of the\nPunjab.\n\nAt the base of the Himalayas there runs a marshy belt of country, the\nhome of malarious vapors, the Terai, in which fever is endemic. But\nthis offered no obstacle to the \"Albatross,\" or, in any way, affected\nthe health of her crew. She kept on without undue haste towards the\nangle where India joins on to China and Turkestan, and on the 29th of\nJune, in the early hours of the morning, there opened to view the\nincomparable valley of Cashmere.\n\nYes! Incomparable is this gorge between the major and the minor\nHimalayas--furrowed by the buttresses in which the mighty range dies\nout in the basin of the Hydaspes, and watered by the capricious\nwindings of the river which saw the struggle between the armies of\nPorus and Alexander, when India and Greece contended for Central\nAsia. The Hydaspes is still there, although the two towns founded by\nthe Macedonian in remembrance of his victory have long since\ndisappeared.\n\nDuring the morning the aeronef was over Serinuggur, which is better\nknown under the name of Cashmere. Uncle Prudent and his companion\nbeheld the superb city clustered along both banks of the river; its\nwooden bridges stretching across like threads, its villas and their\nbalconies standing out in bold outline, its hills shaded by tall\npoplars, its roofs grassed over and looking like molehills; its\nnumerous canals, with boats like nut-shells, and boatmen like ants;\nits palaces, temples, kiosks, mosques, and bungalows on the\noutskirts; and its old citadel of Hari-Pawata on the slope of the\nhill like the most important of the forts of Paris on the slope of\nMont Valerien.\n\n\"That would be Venice,\" said Phil Evans, \"if we were in Europe.\"\n\n\"And if we were in Europe,\" answered Uncle Prudent, \"we should know\nhow to find the way to America.\"\n\nThe \"Albatross\" did not linger over the lake through which the river\nflows, but continued her flight down the valley of the Hydaspes.\n\nFor half an hour only did she descend to within thirty feet of the\nriver and remained stationary. Then, by means of an india-rubber\npipe, Tom Turner and his men replenished their water supply, which\nwas drawn up by a pump worked by the accumulators. Uncle Prudent and\nPhil Evans stood watching the operation. The same idea occurred to\neach of them. They were only a few feet from the surface of the\nstream. They were both good swimmers. A plunge would give them their\nliberty; and once they had reached the river, how could Robur get\nthem back again? For his propellers to work, he must keep at least\nsix feet above the ground.\n\nIn a moment all the chances pro and con were run over in their heads.\nIn a moment they were considered, and the prisoners rushed to throw\nthemselves overboard, when several pairs of hands seized them by the\nshoulders.\n\nThey had been watched; and flight was utterly impossible.\n\nThis time they did not yield without resisting. They tried to throw\noff those who held them. But these men of the \"Albatross\" were no\nchildren.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the engineer, \"when people, have the pleasure of\ntraveling with Robur the Conqueror, as you have so well named him, on\nboard his admirable \"Albatross,\" they do not leave him in that way. I\nmay add you never leave him.\"\n\nPhil Evans drew away his colleague, who was about to commit some act\nof violence. They retired to their cabin, resolved to escape, even if\nit cost them their lives.\n\nImmediately the \"Albatross\" resumed her course to the west. During\nthe day at moderate speed she passed over the territory of\nCabulistan, catching a momentary glimpse of its capital, and crossed\nthe frontier of the kingdom of Herat, nearly seven hundred miles from\nCashmere.\n\nIn these much-disputed countries, the open road for the Russians to\nthe English possessions in India, there were seen many columns and\nconvoys, and, in a word, everything that constitutes in men and\nmaterial an army on the march. There were heard also the roar of the\ncannon and the crackling of musketry. But the engineer never meddled\nwith the affairs of others where his honor or humanity was not\nconcerned. He passed above them. If Herat as we are told, is the key\nof Central Asia, it mattered little to him if it was kept in an\nEnglish or Muscovite pocket. Terrestrial interests were nothing to\nhim who had made the air his domain.\n\nBesides, the country soon disappeared in one of those sandstorms\nwhich are so frequent in these regions. The wind called the \"tebbad\"\nbears along the seeds of fever in the impalpable dust it raises in\nits passage. And many are the caravans that perish in its eddies.\n\nTo escape this dust, which might have interfered with the working of\nthe screws, the \"Albatross\" shot up some six thousand feet into a\npurer atmosphere.\n\nAnd thus vanished the Persian frontier and the extensive plains. The\nspeed was not excessive, although there were no rocks ahead, for the\nmountains marked on the map are of very moderate altitude. But as the\nship approached the capital, she had to steer clear of Demavend,\nwhose snowy peak rises some twenty-two thousand feet, and the chain\nof Elbruz, at whose foot is built Teheran.\n\nAs soon as the day broke on the 2nd of July the peak of Demavend\nappeared above the sandstorm, and the \"Albatross\" was steered so as\nto pass over the town, which the wind had wrapped in a mantle of dust.\n\nHowever, about six o'clock her crew could see the large ditches that\nsurround it, and the Shah's palace, with its walls covered with\nporcelain tiles, and its ornamental lakes, which seemed like huge\nturquoises of beautiful blue.\n\nIt was but a hasty glimpse. The \"Albatross\" now headed for the north,\nand a few hours afterwards she was over a little hill at the northern\nangle of the Persian frontier, on the shores of a vast extent of\nwater which stretched away out of sight to the north and east.\n\nThe town was Ashurada, the most southerly of the Russian stations.\nThe vast extent of water was a sea. It was the Caspian.\n\nThe eddies of sand had been passed. There was a view of a group of\nEuropean houses rising along a promontory, with a church tower in the\nmidst of them.\n\nThe \"Albatross\" swooped down towards the surface of the sea. Towards\nevening she was running along the coast--which formerly belonged to\nTurkestan, but now belongs to Russia--and in the morning of the 3rd\nof July she was about three hundred feet above the Caspian.\n\nThere was no land in sight, either on the Asiatic or European side.\nOn the surface of the sea a few white sails were bellying in the\nbreeze. These were native vessels recognizable by their peculiar\nrig--kesebeys, with two masts; kayuks, the old pirate-boats, with one\nmast; teimils, and smaller craft for trading and fishing. Here and\nthere a few puffs of smoke rose up to the \"Albatross\" from the\nfunnels of the Ashurada steamers, which the Russians keep as the\npolice of these Turcoman waters.\n\nThat morning Tom Turner was talking to the cook, Tapage, and to a\nquestion of his replied, \"Yes; we shall be about forty-eight hours\nover the Caspian.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said the cook; \"Then we can have some fishing.\"\n\n\"Just so.\"\n\nThey were to remain for forty-eight hours over the Caspian, which is\nsome six hundred and twenty-five miles long and two hundred wide,\nbecause the speed of the \"Albatross\" had been much reduced, and while\nthe fishing was going on she would be stopped altogether.\n\nThe reply was heard by Phil Evans, who was then in the bow, where\nFrycollin was overwhelming him with piteous pleadings to be put \"on\nthe ground.\"\n\nWithout replying to this preposterous request, Evans returned aft to\nUncle Prudent; and there, taking care not to be overheard, he\nreported the conversation that had taken place.\n\n\"Phil Evans,\" said Uncle Prudent, \"I think there can be no mistake as\nto this scoundrel's intention with regard to us.\"\n\n\"None,\" said Phil Evans. \"He will only give us our liberty when it\nsuits him, and perhaps not at all.\"\n\n\"In that case we must do all we can to get away from the 'Albatross'.\"\n\n\"A splendid craft, she is, I must admit.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so,\" said Uncle Prudent; \"but she belongs to a scoundrel who\ndetains us on board in defiance of all right. For us and ours she is\na constant danger. If we do not destroy her--\"\n\n\"Let us begin by saving ourselves\" answered Phil Evans; \"we can see\nabout the destruction afterwards.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" said Uncle Prudent. \"And we must avail ourselves of every\nchance that comes, along. Evidently the \"Albatross\" is going to cross\nthe Caspian into Europe, either by the north into Russia or by the\nwest into the southern countries. Well, no matter where we stop,\nbefore we get to the Atlantic, we shall be safe. And we ought to be\nready at any moment.\"\n\n\"But,\" asked Evans, \"how are we to get out?\"\n\n\"Listen to me,\" said Uncle Prudent. \"It may happen during the night\nthat the \"Albatross\" may drop to within a few hundred feet of the\nground. Now there are on board several ropes of that length, and,\nwith a little pluck we might slip down them--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Evans. \"If the case is desperate I don't mind--\"\n\n\"Nor I. During the night there's no one about except the man at the\nwheel. And if we can drop one of the ropes forward without being seen\nor heard--\"\n\n\"Good! I am glad to see you are so cool; that means business. But\njust now we are over the Caspian. There are several ships in sight.\nThe \"Albatross\" is going down to fish. Cannot we do something now?\"\n\n\"Sh! They are watching us much more than you think,\" said Uncle\nPrudent. \"You saw that when we tried to jump into the Hydaspes.\"\n\n\"And who knows that they don't watch us at night?\" asked Evans.\n\n\"Well, we must end this; we must finish with this \"Albatross\" and her\nmaster.\"\n\nIt will be seen how in the excitement of their anger the colleagues--Uncle\nPrudent in particular--were prepared to attempt the most\nhazardous things. The sense of their powerlessness, the ironical\ndisdain with which Robur treated them, the brutal remarks he indulged\nin--all contributed towards intensifying the aggravation which daily\ngrew more manifest.\n\nThis very day something occurred which gave rise to another most\nregrettable altercation between Robur and his guests. This was\nprovoked by Frycollin, who, finding himself above the boundless sea,\nwas seized with another fit of terror. Like a child, like the Negro\nhe was, he gave himself over to groaning and protesting and crying,\nand writhing in a thousand contortions and grimaces.\n\n\"I want to get out! I want to get out! I am not a bird! Boohoo! I\ndon't want to fly, I want to get out!\"\n\nUncle Prudent, as may be imagined, did not attempt to quiet him. In\nfact, he encouraged him, and particularly as the incessant howling\nseemed to have a strangely irritating effect on Robur.\n\nWhen Tom Turner and his companions were getting ready for fishing,\nthe engineer ordered them to shut up Frycollin in his cabin. But the\nNegro never ceased his jumping about, and began to kick at the wall\nand yell with redoubled power.\n\nIt was noon. The \"Albatross\" was only about fifteen or twenty feet\nabove the water. A few ships, terrified at the apparition, sought\nsafety in flight.\n\nAs may be guessed, a sharp look-out was kept on the prisoners, whose\ntemptation to escape could not but be intensified. Even supposing\nthey jumped overboard they would have been picked up by the\nindia-rubber boat. As there was nothing to do during the fishing, in\nwhich Phil Evans intended to take part, Uncle Prudent, raging\nfuriously as usual, retired to his cabin.\n\nThe Caspian Sea is a volcanic depression. Into it flow the waters of\nthe Volga, the Ural, the Kour, the Kouma, the Jemba, and others.\nWithout the evaporation which relieves it of its overflow, this\nbasin, with an area of 17,000 square miles, and a depth of from sixty\nto four hundred feet, would flood the low marshy ground to its north\nand east. Although it is not in communication with the Black Sea or\nthe Sea of Aral, being at a much lower level than they are, it\ncontains an immense number of fish--such fish, be it understood, as\ncan live in its bitter waters, the bitterness being due to the naphtha\nwhich pours in from the springs on the south.\n\nThe crew of the \"Albatross\" made no secret of their delight at the\nchange in their food the fishing would bring them.\n\n\"Look out!\" shouted Turner, as he harpooned a good-size fish, not\nunlike a shark.\n\nIt was a splendid sturgeon seven feet long, called by the Russians\nbeluga, the eggs of which mixed up with salt, vinegar, and white wine\nform caviar. Sturgeons from the river are, it may be, rather better\nthan those from the sea; but these were welcomed warmly enough on\nboard the \"Albatross.\"\n\nBut the best catches were made with the drag-nets, which brought up\nat each haul carp, bream, salmon, saltwater pike, and a number of\nmedium-sized sterlets, which wealthy gourmets have sent alive to\nAstrakhan, Moscow, and Petersburg, and which now passed direct from\ntheir natural element into the cook's kettle without any charge for\ntransport.\n\nAn hour's work sufficed to fill up the larders of the aeronef, and\nshe resumed her course to the north.\n\nDuring the fishing Frycollin had continued shouting and kicking at\nhis cabin wall, and making a tremendous noise.\n\n\"That wretched nigger will not be quiet, then?\" said Robur, almost\nout of patience.\n\n\"It seems to me, sir, he has a right to complain,\" said Phil Evans.\n\n\"Yes, and I have a right to look after my ears,\" replied Robur.\n\n\"Engineer Robur!\" said Uncle Prudent, who had just appeared on deck.\n\n\"President of the Weldon Institute!\"\n\nThey had stepped up to one another, and were looking into the whites\nof each other's eyes. Then Robur shrugged his shoulders. \"Put him at\nthe end of a line,\" he said.\n\nTurner saw his meaning at once. Frycollin was dragged out of his\ncabin. Loud were his cries when the mate and one of the men seized\nhim and tied him into a tub, which they hitched on to a rope--one of\nthose very ropes, in fact, that Uncle Prudent had intended to use as\nwe know.\n\nThe Negro at first thought he was going to be hanged. Not he was only\ngoing to be towed!\n\nThe rope was paid out for a hundred feet and Frycollin found himself\nhanging in space.\n\nHe could then shout at his ease. But fright contracted his larynx,\nand he was mute.\n\nUncle Prudent and Phil Evans endeavored to prevent this performance.\nThey were thrust aside.\n\n\"It is scandalous! It is cowardly!\" said Uncle Prudent, quite beside\nhimself with rage.\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Robur.\n\n\"It is an abuse of power against which I protest.\"\n\n\"Protest away!\"\n\n\"I will be avenged, Mr. Robur.\"\n\n\"Avenge when you like, Mr. Prudent.\"\n\n\"I will have my revenge on you and yours.\"\n\nThe crew began to close up with anything but peaceful intentions.\nRobur motioned them away.\n\n\"Yes, on you and yours!\" said Uncle Prudent, whom his colleague in\nvain tried to keep quiet.\n\n\"Whenever you please!\" said the engineer.\n\n\"And in every possible way!\"\n\n\"That is enough now,\" said Robur, in a threatening tone. \"There are\nother ropes on board. And if you don't be quiet I'll treat you as I\nhave done your servant!\"\n\nUncle Prudent was silent, not because he was afraid, but because his\nwrath had nearly choked him; and Phil Evans led him off to his cabin.\n\nDuring the last hour the air had been strangely troubled. The\nsymptoms could not be mistaken. A storm was threatening. The electric\nsaturation of the atmosphere had become so great that about half-past\ntwo o'clock Robur witnessed a phenomenon that was new to him.\n\nIn the north, whence the storm was traveling, were spirals of\nhalf-luminous vapor due to the difference in the electric charges of\nthe various beds of cloud. The reflections of these bands came\nrunning along the waves in myriads of lights, growing in intensity as\nthe sky darkened.\n\nThe \"Albatross\" and the storm were sure to meet, for they were\nexactly in front of each other.\n\nAnd Frycollin? Well! Frycollin was being towed--and towed is exactly\nthe word, for the rope made such an angle, with the aeronef, now\ngoing at over sixty knots an hour, that the tub was a long way behind\nher.\n\nThe crew were busy in preparing for the storm, for the \"Albatross\"\nwould either have to rise above it or drive through its lowest\nlayers. She was about three thousand feet above the sea when a clap\nof thunder was heard. Suddenly the squall struck her. In a few\nseconds the fiery clouds swept on around her.\n\nPhil Evans went to intercede for Frycollin, and asked for him to be\ntaken on board again. But Robur had already given orders to that\neffect, and the rope was being hauled in, when suddenly there took\nplace an inexplicable slackening in the speed of the screws.\n\nThe engineer rushed to the central deck-house. \"Power! More power!\"\nhe shouted. \"We must rise quickly and get over the storm!\"\n\n\"Impossible, sir!\"\n\n\"What is the matter?\"\n\n\"The currents are troubled! They are intermittent!\" And, in fact, the\n\"Albatross\" was falling fast.\n\nAs with the telegraph wires on land during a storm, so was it with\nthe accumulators of the aeronef. But what is only an inconvenience in\nthe case of messages was here a terrible danger.\n\n\"Let her down, then,\" said Robur, \"and get out of the electric zone!\nKeep cool, my lads!\"\n\nHe stepped on to his quarter-deck and his crew went to their stations.\n\nAlthough the \"Albatross\" had sunk several hundred feet she was still\nin the thick of the cloud, and the flashes played across her as if\nthey were fireworks. It seemed as though she was struck. The screws\nran more and more slowly, and what began as a gentle descent\nthreatened to become a collapse.\n\nIn less than a minute it was evident they would get down to the\nsurface of the sea. Once they were immersed no power could drag them\nfrom the abyss.\n\nSuddenly the electric cloud appeared above them. The \"Albatross\" was\nonly sixty feet from the crest of the waves. In two or three seconds\nthe deck would be under water.\n\nBut Robur, seizing the propitious moment, rushed to the central house\nand seized the levers. He turned on the currents from the piles no\nlonger neutralized by the electric tension of the surrounding\natmosphere. In a moment the screws had regained their normal speed\nand checked the descent; and the \"Albatross\" remained at her slight\nelevation while her propellers drove her swiftly out of reach of the\nstorm.\n\nFrycollin, of course, had a bath--though only for a few seconds.\nWhen he was dragged on deck he was as wet as if he had been to the\nbottom of the sea. As may be imagined, he cried no more.\n\nIn the morning of the 4th of July the \"Albatross\" had passed over the\nnorthern shore of the Caspian.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIV\n\nTHE AERONEF AT FULL SPEED\n\n\nIf ever Prudent and Evans despaired on escaping from the \"Albatross\"\nit was during the two days that followed. It may be that Robur\nconsidered it more difficult to keep a watch on his prisoners while\nhe was crossing Europe, and he knew that they had made up their minds\nto get away.\n\nBut any attempt to have done so would have been simply committing\nsuicide. To jump from an express going sixty miles an hour is to risk\nyour life, but to jump from a machine going one hundred and twenty\nmiles an hour would be to seek your death.\n\nAnd it was at this speed, the greatest that could be given to her,\nthat the \"Albatross\" tore along. Her speed exceeded that of the\nswallow, which is one hundred and twelve miles an hour.\n\nAt first the wind was in the northeast, and the \"Albatross\" had it\nfair, her general course being a westerly one. But the wind began to\ndrop, and it soon became impossible for the colleagues to remain on\nthe deck without having their breath taken away by the rapidity of\nthe flight. And on one occasion they would have been blown overboard\nif they had not been dashed up against the deck-house by the pressure\nof the wind.\n\nLuckily the steersman saw them through the windows of his cage, and\nby the electric bell gave the alarm to the men in the fore-cabin.\nFour of them came aft, creeping along the deck.\n\nThose who have been at sea, beating to windward in half a gale of\nwind, will understand what the pressure was like. But here it was the\n\"Albatross\" that by her incomparable speed made her own wind.\n\nTo allow Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans to get back to their cabin the\nspeed had to be reduced. Inside the deck-house the \"Albatross\" bore\nwith her a perfectly breathable atmosphere. To stand such driving the\nstrength of the apparatus must have been prodigious. The propellers\nspun round so swiftly that they seemed immovable, and it was with\nirresistible power that they screwed themselves through the air.\n\nThe last town that had been noticed was Astrakhan, situated at the\nnorth end of the Caspian Sea. The Star of the Desert--it must have\nbeen a poet who so called it--has now sunk from the first rank to\nthe fifth or sixth. A momentary glance was afforded at its old walls,\nwith their useless battlements, the ancient towers in the center of\nthe city, the mosques and modern churches, the cathedral with its\nfive domes, gilded and dotted with stars as if it were a piece of the\nsky, as they rose from the bank of the Volga, which here, as it joins\nthe sea, is over a mile in width.\n\nThenceforward the flight of the \"Albatross\" became quite a race\nthrough the heights of the sky, as if she had been harnessed to one\nof those fabulous hippogriffs which cleared a league at every sweep\nof the wing.\n\nAt ten o'clock in the morning, of the 4th of July the aeronef,\nheading northwest, followed for a little the valley of the Volga. The\nsteppes of the Don and the Ural stretched away on each side of the\nriver. Even if it had been possible to get a glimpse of these vast\nterritories there would have been no time to count the towns and\nvillages. In the evening the aeronef passed over Moscow without\nsaluting the flag on the Kremlin. In ten hours she had covered the\ntwelve hundred miles which separate Astrakhan from the ancient\ncapital of all the Russias.\n\nFrom Moscow to St. Petersburg the railway line measures about seven\nhundred and fifty miles. This was but a half-day's journey, and the\n\"Albatross,\" as punctual as the mail, reached St. Petersburg and the\nbanks of the Neva at two o'clock in the morning.\n\nThen came the Gulf of Finland, the Archipelago of Abo, the Baltic,\nSweden in the latitude of Stockholm, and Norway in the latitude of\nChristiania. Ten hours only for these twelve hundred miles! Verily it\nmight be thought that no human power would henceforth be able to\ncheck the speed of the \"Albatross,\" and as if the resultant of her\nforce of projection and the attraction of the earth would maintain\nher in an unvarying trajectory round the globe.\n\nBut she did stop nevertheless, and that was over the famous fall of\nthe Rjukanfos in Norway. Gousta, whose summit dominates this\nwonderful region of Tellermarken, stood in the west like a gigantic\nbarrier apparently impassable. And when the \"Albatross\" resumed her\njourney at full speed her head had been turned to the south.\n\nAnd during this extraordinary flight what was Frycollin doing? He\nremained silent in a corner of his cabin, sleeping as well as he\ncould, except at meal times.\n\nTapage then favored him with his company and amused himself at his\nexpense. \"Eh! eh! my boy!\" said he. \"So you are not crying any more?\nPerhaps it hurt you too much? That two hours hanging cured you of it?\nAt our present rate, what a splendid air-bath you might have for your\nrheumatics!\"\n\n\"It seems to me we shall soon go to pieces!\"\n\n\"Perhaps so; but we shall go so fast we shan't have time to fall!\nThat is some comfort!\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\nTo tell the truth, and not to exaggerate like Tapage, it was only\nreasonable that owing to the excessive speed the work of the\nsuspensory screws should be somewhat lessened. The \"Albatross\" glided\non its bed of air like a Congreve rocket.\n\n\"And shall we last long like that?\" asked Frycollin.\n\n\"Long? Oh, no, only as long as we live!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said the Negro, beginning his lamentations.\n\n\"Take care, Fry, take care! For, as they say in my country, the\nmaster may send you to the seesaw!\" And Frycollin gulped down his\nsobs as he gulped down the meat which, in double doses, he was\nhastily swallowing.\n\nMeanwhile Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans, who were not men to waste\ntime in wrangling when nothing could come of it, agreed upon doing\nsomething. It was evident that escape was not to be thought of. But\nif it was impossible for them to again set foot on the terrestrial\nglobe, could they not make known to its inhabitants what had become\nof them since their disappearance, and tell them by whom they had\nbeen carried off, and provoke--how was not very clear--some\naudacious attempt on the part of their friends to rescue them from\nRobur?\n\nCommunicate? But how? Should they follow the example of sailors in\ndistress and enclose in a bottle a document giving the place of\nshipwreck and throw it into the sea? But here the sea was the\natmosphere. The bottle would not swim. And if it did not fall on\nsomebody and crack his skull it might never be found.\n\nThe colleagues were about to sacrifice one of the bottles on board\nwhen an idea occurred to Uncle Prudent. He took snuff, as we know,\nand we may pardon this fault in an American, who might do worse. And\nas a snuff-taker he possessed a snuff-box, which was now empty. This\nbox was made of aluminum. If it was thrown overboard any honest\ncitizen that found it would pick it up, and, being an honest citizen,\nhe would take it to the police-office, and there they would open it\nand discover from the document what had become of the two victims of\nRobur the Conqueror!\n\nAnd this is what was done. The note was short, but it told all, and\nit gave the address of the Weldon Institute, with a request that it\nmight be forwarded. Then Uncle Prudent folded up the note, shut it in\nthe box, bound the box round with a piece of worsted so as to keep it\nfrom opening it as it fell. And then all that had to be done was to\nwait for a favorable opportunity.\n\nDuring this marvelous flight over Europe it was not an easy thing to\nleave the cabin and creep along the deck at the risk of being\nsuddenly and secretly blown away, and it would not do for the\nsnuff-box to fall into the sea or a gulf or a lake or a watercourse,\nfor it would then perhaps be lost. At the same time it was not\nimpossible that the colleagues might in this way get into\ncommunication with the habitable globe.\n\nIt was then growing daylight, and it seemed as though it would be\nbetter to wait for the night and take advantage of a slackening speed\nor a halt to go out on deck and drop the precious snuff-box into some\ntown.\n\nWhen all these points had been thought over and settled, the\nprisoners, found they could not put their plan into execution--on\nthat day, at all events--for the \"Albatross,\" after leaving Gousta,\nhad kept her southerly course, which took her over the North Sea,\nmuch to the consternation of the thousands of coasting craft engaged\nin the English, Dutch, French, and Belgian trade. Unless the\nsnuff-box fell on the deck of one of these vessels there was every\nchance of its going to the bottom of the sea, and Uncle Prudent and\nPhil Evans were obliged to wait for a better opportunity. And, as we\nshall immediately see, an excellent chance was soon to be offered\nthem.\n\nAt ten o'clock that evening the \"Albatross\" reached the French coast\nnear Dunkirk. The night was rather dark. For a moment they could see\nthe lighthouse at Grisnez cross its electric beam with the lights\nfrom Dover on the other side of the strait. Then the \"Albatross\" flew\nover the French territory at a mean height of three thousand feet.\n\nThere was no diminution in her speed. She shot like a rocket over the\ntowns and villages so numerous in northern France. She was flying\nstraight on to Paris, and after Dunkirk came Doullens, Amiens, Creil,\nSaint Denis. She never left the line; and about midnight she was over\nthe \"city of light,\" which merits its name even when its inhabitants\nare asleep or ought to be.\n\nBy what strange whim was it that she was stopped over the city of\nParis? We do not know; but down she came till she was within a few\nhundred feet of the ground. Robur then came out of his cabin, and the\ncrew came on to the deck to breathe the ambient air.\n\nUncle Prudent and Phil Evans took care not to miss such an excellent\nopportunity. They left their deck-house and walked off away from the\nothers so as to be ready at the propitious moment. It was important\ntheir action should not be seen.\n\nThe \"Albatross,\" like a huge coleopter, glided gently over the mighty\ncity. She took the line of the boulevards, then brilliantly lighted\nby the Edison lamps. Up to her there floated the rumble of the\nvehicles as they drove along the streets, and the roll of the trains\non the numerous railways that converge into Paris. Then she glided\nover the highest monuments as if she was going to knock the ball off\nthe Pantheon or the cross off the Invalides. She hovered over the two\nminarets of the Trocadero and the metal tower of the Champ de Mars,\nwhere the enormous reflector was inundating the whole capital with\nits electric rays.\n\nThis aerial promenade, this nocturnal loitering, lasted for about an\nhour. It was a halt for breath before the voyage was resumed.\n\nAnd probably Robur wished to give the Parisians the sight of a meteor\nquite unforeseen by their astronomers. The lamps of the \"Albatross\"\nwere turned on. Two brilliant sheaves of light shot down and moved\nalong over the squares, the gardens, the palaces, the sixty thousand\nhouses, and swept the space from one horizon to the other.\n\nAssuredly the \"Albatross\" was seen this time--and not only well seen\nbut heard, for Tom Turner brought out his trumpet and blew a rousing\ntarantaratara.\n\nAt this moment Uncle Prudent leant over the rail, opened his hand,\nand let his snuff-box fall.\n\nImmediately the \"Albatross\" shot upwards, and past her, higher still,\nthere mounted the noisy cheering of the crowd then thick on the\nboulevards--a hurrah of stupefaction to greet the imaginary meteor.\n\nThe lamps of the aeronef were turned off, and the darkness and the\nsilence closed in around as the voyage was resumed at the rate of one\nhundred and twenty miles an hour.\n\nThis was all that was to be seen of the French capital. At four\no'clock in the morning the \"Albatross\" had crossed the whole country\nobliquely; and so as to lose no time in traversing the Alps or the\nPyrenees, she flew over the face of Provence to the cape of Antibes.\nAt nine o'clock next morning the San Pietrini assembled on the\nterrace of St. Peter at Rome were astounded to see her pass over the\neternal city. Two hours afterwards she crossed the Bay of Naples and\nhovered for an instant over the fuliginous wreaths of Vesuvius. Then,\nafter cutting obliquely across the Mediterranean, in the early hours\nof the afternoon she was signaled by the look-outs at La Goulette on\nthe Tunisian coast.\n\nAfter America, Asia! After Asia, Europe! More than eighteen thousand\nmiles had this wonderful machine accomplished in less than\ntwenty-three days!\n\nAnd now she was off over the known and unknown regions of Africa!\n\nIt may be interesting to know what had happened to the famous\nsnuff-box after its fall?\n\nIt had fallen in the Rue de Rivoli, opposite No. 200, when the street\nwas deserted. In the morning it was picked up by an honest sweeper,\nwho took it to the prefecture of police. There it was at first\nsupposed to be an infernal machine. And it was untied, examined, and\nopened with care.\n\nSuddenly a sort of explosion took place. It was a terrific sneeze on\nthe part of the inspector.\n\nThe document was then extracted from the snuff-box, and to the\ngeneral surprise, read as follows:\n\n\"Messrs. Prudent and Evans, president and secretary of the Weldon\nInstitute, Philadelphia, have been carried off in the aeronef\nAlbatross belonging to Robur the engineer.\"\n\n\"Please inform our friends and acquaintances.\"\n\n\"P. and P. E.\"\n\nThus was the strange phenomenon at last explained to the people of\nthe two worlds. Thus was peace given to the scientists of the\nnumerous observatories on the surface of the terrestrial globe.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XV\n\nA SKIRMISH IN DAHOMEY\n\n\nAt this point in the circumnavigatory voyage of the \"Albatross\" it is\nonly natural that some such questions as the following should be\nasked. Who was this Robur, of whom up to the present we know nothing\nbut the name? Did he pass his life in the air? Did his aeronef never\nrest? Had he not some retreat in some inaccessible spot in which, if\nhe had need of repose or revictualing, he could betake himself? It\nwould be very strange if it were not so. The most powerful flyers\nhave always an eyrie or nest somewhere.\n\nAnd what was the engineer going to do with his prisoners? Was he\ngoing to keep them in his power and condemn them to perpetual\naviation? Or was he going to take them on a trip over Africa, South\nAmerica, Australasia, the Indian Ocean, the Atlantic and the Pacific,\nto convince them against their will, and then dismiss them with, \"And\nnow gentlemen, I hope you will believe a little more in heavier than\nair?\"\n\nTo these questions, it is now impossible to reply. They are the\nsecrets of the future. Perhaps the answers will be revealed. Anyhow\nthe bird-like Robur was not seeking his nest on the northern frontier\nof Africa. By the end of the day he had traversed Tunis from Cape Bon\nto Cape Carthage, sometimes hovering, and sometimes darting along at\ntop speed. Soon he reached the interior, and flew down the beautiful\nvalley of Medjeida above its yellow stream hidden under its luxuriant\nbushes of cactus and oleander; and scared away the hundreds of\nparrots that perch on the telegraph wires and seem to wait for the\nmessages to pass to bear them away beneath their wings.\n\nTwo hours after sunset the helm was put up and the \"Albatross\" bore\noff to the southeast; and on the morrow, after clearing the Tell\nMountains, she saw the rising of the morning star over the sands of\nthe Sahara.\n\nOn the 30th of July there was seen from the aeronef the little\nvillage of Geryville, founded like Laghouat on the frontier of the\ndesert to facilitate the future conquest of Kabylia. Next, not\nwithout difficulty, the peaks of Stillero were passed against a\nsomewhat boisterous wind. Then the desert was crossed, sometimes\nleisurely over the Ksars or green oases, sometimes at terrific speed\nthat far outstripped the flight of the vultures. Often the crew had\nto fire into the flocks of these birds which, a dozen or so at a\ntime, fearlessly hurled them selves on to the aeronef to the extreme\nterror of Frycollin.\n\nBut if the vultures could only reply with cries and blows of beaks\nand talons, the natives, in no way less savage, were not sparing of\ntheir musket-shots, particularly when crossing the Mountain of Sel,\nwhose green and violet slope bore its cape of white. Then the\n\"Albatross\" was at last over the grand Sahara; and at once she rose\ninto the higher zones so as to escape from a simoom which was\nsweeping a wave of ruddy sand along the surface of the ground like a\nbore on the surface of the sea.\n\nThen the desolate tablelands of Chetka scattered their ballast in\nblackish waves up to the fresh and verdant valley of Ain-Massin. It\nis difficult to conceive the variety of the territories which could\nbe seen at one view. To the green hills covered with trees and shrubs\nthere succeeded long gray undulations draped like the folds of an\nArab burnous and broken in picturesque masses. In the distance could\nbe seen the wadys with their torrential waters, their forests of\npalm-trees, and blocks of small houses grouped on a hill around a\nmosque, among them Metlili, where there vegetates a religious chief,\nthe grand marabout Sidi Chick.\n\nBefore night several hundred miles had been accomplished above a\nflattish country ridged occasionally with large sandhills. If the\n\"Albatross\" had halted, she would have come to the earth in the\ndepths of the Wargla oasis hidden beneath an immense forest of\npalm-trees. The town was clearly enough displayed with its three\ndistinct quarters, the ancient palace of the Sultan, a kind of\nfortified Kasbah, houses of brick which had been left to the sun to\nbake, and artesian wells dug in the valley--where the aeronef could\nhave renewed her water supply. But, thanks to her extraordinary\nspeed, the waters of the Hydaspes taken in the vale of Cashmere still\nfilled her tanks in the center of the African desert.\n\nWas the \"Albatross\" seen by the Arabs, the Mozabites, and the Negroes\nwho share amongst them the town of Wargla? Certainly, for she was\nsaluted with many hundred gunshot, and the bullets fell back before\nthey reached her.\n\nThen came the night, that silent night in the desert of which\nFelicien David has so poetically told us the secrets.\n\nDuring the following hours the course lay southwesterly, cutting\nacross the routes of El Golea, one of which was explored in 1859 by\nthe intrepid Duveyrier.\n\nThe darkness was profound. Nothing could be seen of the Trans-Saharan\nRailway constructing on the plans of Duponchel--a long ribbon of\niron destined to bind together Algiers and Timbuktu by way of\nLaghouat and Gardaia, and destined eventually to run down into the\nGulf of Guinea.\n\nThen the \"Albatross\" entered the equatorial region below the tropic\nof Cancer. Six hundred miles from the northern frontier of the Sahara\nshe crossed the route on which Major Laing met his, death in 1846,\nand crossed the road of the caravans from Morocco to the Sudan, and\nthat part of the desert swept by the Tuaregs, where could be heard\nwhat is called \"the song of the sand,\" a soft and plaintive murmur\nthat seems to escape from the ground.\n\nOnly one thing happened. A cloud of locusts came flying along, and\nthere fell such a cargo of them on board as to threaten to sink the\nship. But all hands set to work to clear the deck, and the locusts\nwere thrown over except a few hundred kept by Tapage for his larder.\nAnd he served them up in so succulent a fashion that Frycollin forgot\nfor the moment his perpetual trances and said, \"these are as good as\nprawns.\"\n\nThe aeronef was then eleven hundred miles from the Wargla oasis and\nalmost on the northern frontier of the Sudan. About two o'clock in\nthe afternoon a city appeared in the bend of a large river. The river\nwas the Niger. The city was Timbuktu.\n\nIf, up to then, this African Mecca had only been visited by the\ntravelers of the ancient world Batouta, Khazan, Imbert, Mungo Park,\nAdams, Laing, Caill\u00c3\u00a9, Barth, Lenz, on that day by a most singular\nchance the two Americans could boast of having seen, heard, and smelt\nit, on their return to America--if they ever got back there.\n\nOf having seen it, because their view included the whole triangle of\nthree or four miles in circumference; of having heard it, because the\nday was one of some rejoicing and the noise was terrible; of having\nsmelt it, because the olfactory nerve could not but be very\ndisagreeably affected by the odors of the Youbou-Kamo square, where\nthe meatmarket stands close to the palace of the ancient Somai kings.\n\nThe engineer had no notion of allowing the president and secretary of\nthe Weldon Institute to be ignorant that they had the honor of\ncontemplating the Queen of the Sudan, now in the power of the Tuaregs\nof Taganet.\n\n\"Gentlemen, Timbuktu!\" he said, in the same tone as twelve days\nbefore he had said, \"Gentlemen, India!\" Then he continued, \"Timbuktu\nis an important city of from twelve to thirteen thousand inhabitants,\nformerly illustrious in science and art. Perhaps you would like to\nstay there for a day or two?\"\n\nSuch a proposal could only have been made ironically. \"But,\"\ncontinued he, \"it would be dangerous among the Negroes, Berbers, and\nFoullanes who occupy, it--particularly as our arrival in an aeronef\nmight prejudice them against you.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Phil Evans, in the same tone, \"for the pleasure of\nleaving you we would willingly risk an unpleasant reception from the\nnatives. Prison for prison, we would rather be in Timbuktu than on\nthe \"Albatross.\"\"\n\n\"That is a matter of taste,\" answered the engineer. \"Anyhow, I shall\nnot try the adventure, for I am responsible for the safety of the\nguests who do me the honor to travel with me.\"\n\n\"And so,\" said Uncle Prudent, explosively, \"you are not content with\nbeing our jailer, but you insult us.\"\n\n\"Oh! a little irony, that is all!\"\n\n\"Are there any weapons on board?\"\n\n\"Oh, quite an arsenal.\"\n\n\"Two revolvers will do, if I hold one and you the other.\"\n\n\"A duel!\" exclaimed Robur, \"a duel, which would perhaps cause the\ndeath of one of us.\"\n\n\"Which certainly would cause it.\"\n\n\"Well! No, Mr. President of the Weldon Institute, I very much prefer\nkeeping you alive.\"\n\n\"To be sure of living yourself. That is wise.\"\n\n\"Wise or not, it suits me. You are at liberty to think as you like,\nand to complain to those who have the power to help you--if you can.\"\n\n\"And that we have done, Mr. Robur.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"Was it so difficult when we were crossing the inhabited part of\nEurope to drop a letter overboard?\"\n\n\"Did you do that?\" said Robur, in a paroxysm of rage.\n\n\"And if we have done it?\"\n\n\"If you have done it--you deserve--\"\n\n\"What, sir?\"\n\n\"To follow your letter overboard.\"\n\n\"Throw us over, then. We did do it.\"\n\nRobur stepped towards them. At a gesture from him Tom Turner and some\nof the crew ran up. The engineer was seriously tempted to put his\nthreat into execution, and, fearful perhaps of yielding to it, he\nprecipitately rushed into his cabin.\n\n\"Good!\" exclaimed Phil Evans.\n\n\"And what he will dare not do,\" said Uncle Prudent, \"I Will do! Yes,\nI Will do!\"\n\nAt the moment the population of Timbuktu were crowding onto the\nsquares and roads and the terraces built like amphitheaters. In the\nrich quarters of Sankere and Sarahama, as in the miserable huts at\nRaguidi, the priests from the minarets were thundering their loudest\nmaledictions against the aerial monster. These were more harmless\nthan the rifle-bullets; though assuredly, if the aeronef had come to\nearth she would have certainly been torn to pieces.\n\nFor some miles noisy flocks of storks, francolins, and ibises\nescorted the \"Albatross\" and tried to race her, but in her rapid\nflight she soon distanced them.\n\nThe evening came. The air was troubled by the roarings of the\nnumerous herds of elephants and buffaloes which wander over this\nland, whose fertility is simply marvelous. For forty-eight hours the\nwhole of the region between the prime meridian and the second degree,\nin the bend of the Niger, was viewed from the \"Albatross.\"\n\nIf a geographer had only such an apparatus at his command, with what\nfacility could he map the country, note the elevations, fix the\ncourses of the rivers and their affluents, and determine the\npositions of the towns and villages! There would then be no huge\nblanks on the map of Africa, no dotted lines, no vague designations\nwhich are the despair of cartographers.\n\nIn the morning of the 11th the \"Albatross\" crossed the mountains of\nnorthern Guinea, between the Sudan and the gulf which bears their\nname. On the horizon was the confused outline of the Kong mountains\nin the kingdom of Dahomey.\n\nSince the departure from Timbuktu Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans\nnoticed that the course had been due south. If that direction was\npersisted in they would cross the equator in six more degrees. The\n\"Albatross\" would then abandon the continents and fly not over the\nBering Sea, or the Caspian Sea, or the North Sea, or the\nMediterranean, but over the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThis look-out was not particularly pleasing to the two friends, whose\nchances of escape had sunk to below zero. But the \"Albatross\" had\nslackened speed as though hesitating to leave Africa behind. Was\nRobur thinking of going back? No; but his attention had been\nparticularly attracted to the country which he was then crossing.\n\nWe know--and he knew--that the kingdom of Dahomey is one of the\nmost powerful on the West Coast of Africa. Strong enough to hold its\nown with its neighbor Ashantee, its area is somewhat small, being\ncontained within three hundred and sixty leagues from north to south,\nand one hundred and eighty from east to west. But its population\nnumbers some seven or eight hundred thousand, including the\nneighboring independent territories of Whydah and Ardrah.\n\nIf Dahomey is not a large country, it is often talked about. It is\ncelebrated for the frightful cruelties which signalize its annual\nfestivals, and by its human sacrifices--fearful hecatombs intended\nto honor the sovereign it has lost and the sovereign who has\nsucceeded him. It is even a matter of politeness when the King of\nDahomey receives a visit from some high personage or some foreign\nambassador to give him a surprise present of a dozen heads, cut off\nin his honor by the minister of justice, the \"minghan,\" who is\nwonderfully skillful in that branch of his duties.\n\nWhen the \"Albatross\" came flying over Dahomey, the old King Bahadou\nhad just died, and the whole population was proceeding to the\nenthronization of his successor. Hence there was great agitation all\nover the country, and it did not escape Robur that everybody was on\nthe move.\n\nLong lines of Dahomians were hurrying along the roads from the\ncountry into the capital, Abomey. Well kept roads radiating among\nvast plains clothed with giant trees, immense fields of manioc,\nmagnificent forests of palms, cocoa-trees, mimosas, orange-trees,\nmango-trees--such was the country whose perfumes mounted to the\n\"Albatross,\" while many parrots and cardinals swarmed among the trees.\n\nThe engineer, leaning over the rail, seemed deep in thought, and\nexchanged but a few words with Tom Turner. It did not look as though\nthe \"Albatross\" had attracted the attention of those moving masses,\nwhich were often invisible under the impenetrable roof of trees. This\nwas doubtless due to her keeping at a good altitude amid a bank of\nlight cloud.\n\nAbout eleven o'clock in the morning the capital was sighted,\nsurrounded by its walls, defended by a fosse measuring twelve miles\nround, with wide, regular streets on the flat plain, and a large\nsquare on the northern side occupied by the king's palace. This huge\ncollection of buildings is commanded by a terrace not far from the\nplace of sacrifice. During the festival days it is from this high\nterrace that they throw the prisoners tied up in wicker baskets, and\nit can be imagined with what fury these unhappy wretches are cut in\npieces.\n\nIn one of the courtyards which divide the king's palace there were\ndrawn up four thousand warriors, one of the contigents of the royal\narmy--and not the least courageous one. If it is doubtful if there\nare any Amazons an the river of that name, there is no doubt of there\nbeing Amazons at Dahomey. Some have a blue shirt with a blue or red\nscarf, with white-and-blue striped trousers and a white cap; others,\nthe elephant-huntresses, have a heavy carbine, a short-bladed dagger,\nand two antelope horns fixed to their heads by a band of iron. The\nartillery-women have a blue-and-red tunic, and, as weapons,\nblunderbusses and old cast cannons; and another brigade, consisting\nof vestal virgins, pure as Diana, have blue tunics and white\ntrousers. If we add to these Amazons, five or six thousand men in\ncotton drawers and shirts, with a knotted tuft to increase their\nstature, we shall have passed in review the Dahomian army.\n\nAbomey on this day was deserted. The sovereign, the royal family, the\nmasculine and feminine army, and the population had all gone out of\nthe capital to a vast plain a few miles away surrounded by\nmagnificent forests.\n\nOn this plain the recognition of the new king was to take place. Here\nit was that thousands of prisoners taken during recent razzias were\nto be immolated in his honor.\n\nIt was about two o'clock when the \"Albatross\" arrived over the plain\nand began to descend among the clouds which still hid her from the\nDahomians.\n\nThere were sixteen thousand people at least come from all parts of\nthe kingdom, from Whydah, and Kerapay, and Ardrah, and Tombory, and\nthe most distant villages.\n\nThe new king--a sturdy fellow named Bou-Nadi--some five-and-twenty\nyears old, was seated on a hillock shaded by a group of wide-branched\ntrees. Before him stood his male army, his Amazons, and his people.\n\nAt the foot of the mound fifty musicians were playing on their\nbarbarous instruments, elephants' tusks giving forth a husky note,\ndeerskin drums, calabashes, guitars, bells struck with an iron\nclapper, and bamboo flutes, whose shrill whistle was heard over all.\nEvery other second came discharges of guns and blunderbusses,\ndischarges of cannons with the carriages jumping so as to imperil the\nlives of the artillery-women, and a general uproar so intense that\neven the thunder would be unheard amidst it.\n\nIn one corner of the plain, under a guard of soldiers, were grouped\nthe prisoners destined to accompany the defunct king into the other\nworld. At the obsequies of Ghozo, the father of Bahadou, his son had\ndispatched three thousand, and Bou-Nadi could not do less than his\npredecessor. For an hour there was a series of discourses, harangues,\npalavers and dances, executed not only by professionals, but by the\nAmazons, who displayed much martial grace.\n\nBut the time for the hecatomb was approaching. Robur, who knew the\ncustoms of Dahomey, did not lose sight of the men, women, and\nchildren reserved for butchery.\n\nThe minghan was standing at the foot of the hillock. He was\nbrandishing his executioner's sword, with its curved blade surmounted\nby a metal bird, whose weight rendered the cut more certain.\n\nThis time he was not alone. He could not have performed the task.\nNear him were grouped a hundred executioners, all accustomed to cut\noff heads at one blow.\n\nThe \"Albatross\" came slowly down in an oblique direction. Soon she\nemerged from the bed of clouds which hid her till she was within\nthree hundred feet of the ground, and for the first time she was\nvisible from below.\n\nContrary to what had hitherto happened, the savages saw in her a\ncelestial being come to render homage to King Baha-dou. The\nenthusiasm was indescribable, the shouts were interminable, the\nprayers were terrific--prayers addressed to this supernatural\nhippogriff, which \"had doubtless come to\" take the king's body to the\nhigher regions of the Dahomian heaven. And now the first head fell\nunder the minghan's sword, and the prisoners were led up in hundreds\nbefore the horrible executioners.\n\nSuddenly a gun was fired from the \"Albatross.\" The minister of\njustice fell dead on his face!\n\n\"Well aimed, Tom!\" said Robur,\n\nHis comrades, armed as he was, stood ready to fire when the order was\ngiven.\n\nBut a change came over the crowd below. They had understood. The\nwinged monster was not a friendly spirit, it was a hostile spirit.\nAnd after the fall of the minghan loud shouts for revenge arose on\nall sides. Almost immediately a fusillade resounded over the plain.\n\nThese menaces did not prevent the \"Albatross\" from descending boldly\nto within a hundred and fifty feet of the ground. Uncle Prudent and\nPhil Evans, whatever were their feelings towards Robur, could not\nhelp joining him in such a work of humanity.\n\n\"Let us free the prisoners!\" they shouted.\n\n\"That is what I am going to do!\" said the engineer.\n\nAnd the magazine rifles of the \"Albatross\" in the hands of the\ncolleagues, as in the hands of the crew, began to rain down the\nbullets, of which not one was lost in the masses below. And the\nlittle gun shot forth its shrapnel, which really did marvels.\n\nThe prisoners, although they did not understand how the help had come\nto them, broke their bonds, while the soldiers were firing at the\naeronef. The stern screw was shot through by a bullet, and a few\nholes were made in the hull. Frycollin, crouching in his cabin,\nreceived a graze from a bullet that came through the deck-house.\n\n\"Ah! They will have them!\" said Tom Turner. And, rushing to the\nmagazine, he returned with a dozen dynamite cartridges, which he\ndistributed to the men. At a sign from Robur, these cartridges were\nfired at the hillock, and as they reached the ground exploded like so\nmany small shells.\n\nThe king and his court and army and people were stricken with fear at\nthe turn things had taken. They fled under the trees, while the\nprisoners ran off without anybody thinking of pursuing them.\n\nIn this way was the festival interfered with. And in this way did\nUncle Prudent and, Phil Evans recognize the power of the aeronef and\nthe services it could render to humanity.\n\nSoon the \"Albatross\" rose again to a moderate height, and passing\nover Whydah lost to view this savage coast which the southwest wind\nhems round with an inaccessible surf. And she flew out over the\nAtlantic.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVI\n\nOVER THE ATLANTIC\n\n\nYes, the Atlantic! The fears of the two colleagues were realized; but\nit did not seem as though Robur had the least anxiety about venturing\nover this vast ocean. Both he and his men seemed quite unconcerned\nabout it and had gone back to their stations.\n\nWhither was the \"Albatross\" bound? Was she going more than round the\nworld as Robur had said? Even if she were, the voyage must end\nsomewhere. That Robur spent his life in the air on board the aeronef\nand never came to the ground was impossible. How could he make up his\nstock of provisions and the materials required for working his\nmachines? He must have some retreat, some harbor of refuge--in some\nunknown and inaccessible spot where the \"Albatross\" could revictual.\nThat he had broken off all connections with the inhabitants of the\nland might be true, but with every point on the surface of the earth,\ncertainly not.\n\nThat being the case, where was this point? How had the engineer come\nto choose it? Was he expected by a little colony of which he was the\nchief? Could he there find a new crew?\n\nWhat means had he that he should be able to build so costly a vessel\nas the \"Albatross\" and keep her building secret? It is true his\nliving was not expensive. But, finally, who was this Robur? Where did\nhe come from? What had been his history? Here were riddles impossible\nto solve; and Robur was not the man to assist willingly in their\nsolution.\n\nIt is not to be wondered at that these insoluble problems drove the\ncolleagues almost to frenzy. To find themselves whipped off into the\nunknown without knowing what the end might be doubting even if the\nadventure would end, sentenced to perpetual aviation, was this not\nenough to drive the President and secretary of the Weldon Institute\nto extremities?\n\nMeanwhile the \"Albatross\" drove along above the Atlantic, and in the\nmorning when the sun rose there was nothing to be seen but the\ncircular line where earth met sky. Not a spot of land was insight in\nthis huge field of vision. Africa had vanished beneath the northern\nhorizon.\n\nWhen Frycollin ventured out of his cabin and saw all this water\nbeneath him, fear took possession of him.\n\nOf the hundred and forty-five million square miles of which the area\nof the world's waters consists, the Atlantic claims about a quarter;\nand it seemed as though the engineer was in no hurry to cross it.\nThere was now no going at full speed, none of the hundred and twenty\nmiles an hour at which the \"Albatross\" had flown over Europe. Here,\nwhere the southwest winds prevail, the wind was ahead of them, and\nthough it was not very strong, it would not do to defy it and the\n\"Albatross\" was sent along at a moderate speed, which, however,\neasily outstripped that of the fastest mail-boat.\n\nOn the 13th of July she crossed the line, and the fact was duly\nannounced to the crew. It was then that Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans\nascertained that they were bound for the southern hemisphere. The\ncrossing of the line took place without any of the Neptunian\nceremonies that still linger on certain ships. Tapage was the only\none to mark the event, and he did so by pouring a pint of water down\nFrycollin's neck.\n\nOn the 18th of July, when beyond the tropic of Capricorn, another\nphenomenon was noticed, which would have been somewhat alarming to a\nship on the sea. A strange succession of luminous waves widened out\nover the surface of the ocean with a speed estimated at quite sixty\nmiles an hour. The waves ran along at about eight feet from one\nanother, tracing two furrows of light. As night fell a bright\nreflection rose even to the \"Albatross,\" so that she might have been\ntaken for a flaming aerolite. Never before had Robur sailed on a sea\nof fire--fire without heat--which there was no need to flee from as\nit mounted upwards into the sky.\n\nThe cause of this light must have been electricity; it could not be\nattributed to a bank of fish spawn, nor to a crowd of those\nanimalculae that give phosphorescence to the sea, and this showed\nthat the electrical tension of the atmosphere was considerable.\n\nIn the morning an ordinary ship would probably have been lost. But\nthe \"Albatross\" played with the winds and waves like the powerful\nbird whose name she bore. If she did not walk on their surface like\nthe petrels, she could like the eagles find calm and sunshine in the\nhigher zones.\n\nThey had now passed the forty-seventh parallel. The day was but\nlittle over seven hours long, and would become even less as they\napproached the Pole.\n\nAbout one o'clock in the afternoon the \"Albatross\" was floating along\nin a lower current than usual, about a hundred feet from the level of\nthe sea. The air was calm, but in certain parts of the sky were thick\nblack clouds, massed in mountains, on their upper surface, and ruled\noff below by a sharp horizontal line. From these clouds a few lengthy\nprotuberances escaped, and their points as they fell seemed to draw\nup hills of foaming water to meet them.\n\nSuddenly the water shot up in the form of a gigantic hourglass, and\nthe \"Albatross\" was enveloped in the eddy of an enormous waterspout,\nwhile twenty others, black as ink, raged around her. Fortunately the\ngyratory movement of the water was opposite to that of the suspensory\nscrews, otherwise the aeronef would have been hurled into the sea.\nBut she began to spin round on herself with frightful rapidity. The\ndanger was immense, and perhaps impossible to escape, for the\nengineer could not get through the spout which sucked him back in\ndefiance of his propellers. The men, thrown to the ends of the deck\nby centrifugal force, were grasping the rail to save themselves from\nbeing shot off.\n\n\"Keep cool!\" shouted Robur.\n\nThey wanted all their coolness, and their patience, too. Uncle\nPrudent and Phil Evans, who had just come out of their cabin, were\nhurled back at the risk of flying overboard. As she spun the\n\"Albatross\" was carried along by the spout, which pirouetted along\nthe waves with a speed enough to make the helices jealous. And if she\nescaped from the spout she might be caught by another, and jerked to\npieces with the shock.\n\n\"Get the gun ready!\" said Robur.\n\nThe order was given to Tom Turner, who was crouching behind the\nswivel amidships where the effect of the centrifugal force was least\nfelt. He understood. In a moment he had opened the breech and slipped\na cartridge from the ammunition-box at hand. The gun went off, and the\nwaterspouts collapsed, and with them vanished the platform of cloud\nthey seemed to bear above them.\n\n\"Nothing broken on board?\" asked Robur.\n\n\"No,\" answered Tom Turner. \"But we don't want to have another game of\nhumming-top like that!\"\n\nFor ten minutes or so the \"Albatross\" had been in extreme peril. Had\nit not been for her extraordinary strength of build she would have\nbeen lost.\n\nDuring this passage of the Atlantic many were the hours whose\nmonotony was unbroken by any phenomenon whatever. The days grew\nshorter and shorter, and the cold became keen. Uncle Prudent and Phil\nEvans saw little of Robur. Seated in his cabin, the engineer was busy\nlaying out his course and marking it on his maps, taking his\nobservations whenever he could, recording the readings of his\nbarometers, thermometers, and chronometers, and making full entries\nin his log-book.\n\nThe colleagues wrapped themselves well up and eagerly watched for the\nsight of land to the southward. At Uncle Prudent's request Frycollin\ntried to pump the cook as to whither the engineer was bound, but what\nreliance could be placed on the information given by this Gascon?\nSometimes Robur was an ex-minister of the Argentine Republic,\nsometimes a lord of the Admiralty, sometimes an ex-President of the\nUnited States, sometimes a Spanish general temporarily retired,\nsometimes a Viceroy of the Indies who had sought a more elevated\nposition in the air. Sometimes he possessed millions, thanks to\nsuccessful razzias in the aeronef, and he had been proclaimed for\npiracy. Sometimes he had been ruined by making the aeronef, and had\nbeen forced to fly aloft to escape from his creditors. As to knowing\nif he were going to stop anywhere, no! But if he thought of going to\nthe moon, and found there a convenient anchorage, he would anchor\nthere! \"Eh! Fry! My boy! That would just suit you to see what was\ngoing on up there.\"\n\n\"I shall not go! I refuse!\" said the Negro, who took all these things\nseriously.\n\n\"And why, Fry, why? You might get married to some pretty bouncing\nLunarian!\"\n\nFrycollin reported this conversation to his master, who saw it was\nevident that nothing was to be learnt about Robur. And so he thought\nstill more of how he could have his revenge on him.\n\n\"Phil,\" said he one day, \"is it quite certain that escape is\nimpossible?\"\n\n\"Impossible.\"\n\n\"Be it so! But a man is always his own property; and if necessary, by\nsacrificing his life--\"\n\n\"If we are to make that sacrifice,\" said Phil Evans, \"the sooner the\nbetter. It is almost time to end this. Where is the \"Albatross\"\ngoing? Here we are flying obliquely over the Atlantic, and if we keep\non we shall get to the coast of Patagonia or Tierra del Fuego. And\nwhat are we to do then? Get into the Pacific, or go to the continent\nat the South Pole? Everything is possible with this Robur. We shall\nbe lost in the end. It is thus a case of legitimate self-defence, and\nif we must perish--\"\n\n\"Which we shall not do,\" answered Uncle Prudent, \"without being\navenged, without annihilating this machine and all she carries.\"\n\nThe colleagues had reached a stage of impotent fury, and were\nprepared to sacrifice themselves if they could only destroy the\ninventor and his secret. A few months only would then be the life of\nthis prodigious aeronef, of whose superiority in aerial locomotion\nthey had such convincing proofs! The idea took such hold of them that\nthey thought of nothing else but how to put it into execution. And\nhow? By seizing on some of the explosives on board and simply blowing\nher up. But could they get at the magazines?\n\nFortunately for them, Frycollin had no suspicion of their scheme. At\nthe thought of the \"Albatross\" exploding in midair, he would not have\nshrunk from betraying his master.\n\nIt was on the 23rd of July that the land reappeared in the southwest\nnear Cape Virgins at the entrance of the Straits of Magellan. Under\nthe fifty-second parallel at this time of year the night was eighteen\nhours long and the temperature was six below freezing.\n\nAt first the \"Albatross,\" instead of keeping on to the south,\nfollowed the windings of the coast as if to enter the Pacific. After\npassing Lomas Bay, leaving Mount Gregory to the north and the\nBrecknocks to the west, they sighted Puerto Arena, a small Chilean\nvillage, at the moment the churchbells were in full swing; and a few\nhours later they were over the old settlement at Port Famine.\n\nIf the Patagonians, whose fires could be seen occasionally, were\nreally above the average in stature, the passengers in the aeronef\nwere unable to say, for to them they seemed to be dwarfs. But what a\nmagnificent landscape opened around during these short hours of the\nsouthern day! Rugged mountains, peaks eternally capped with snow,\nwith thick forests rising on their flanks, inland seas, bays deep set\namid the peninsulas, and islands of the Archipelago. Clarence Island,\nDawson Island, and the Land of Desolation, straits and channels,\ncapes and promontories, all in inextricable confusion, and bound by\nthe ice in one solid mass from Cape Forward, the most southerly point\nof the American continent, to Cape Horn the most southerly point of\nthe New World.\n\nWhen she reached Fort Famine the \"Albatross\" resumed her course to\nthe south. Passing between Mount Tam on the Brunswick Peninsula and\nMount Graves, she steered for Mount Sarmiento, an enormous peak\nwrapped in snow, which commands the Straits of Magellan, rising six\nthousand four hundred feet from the sea. And now they were over the\nland of the Fuegians, Tierra del Fuego, the land of fire. Six months\nlater, in the height of summer, with days from fifteen to sixteen\nhours long, how beautiful and fertile would most of this country be,\nparticularly in its northern portion! Then, all around would be seen\nvalleys and pasturages that could form the feeding-grounds of\nthousands of animals; then would appear virgin forests, gigantic\ntrees-birches, beeches, ash-trees, cypresses, tree-ferns--and broad\nplains overrun by herds of guanacos, vicunas, and ostriches. Now\nthere were armies of penguins and myriads of birds; and, when the\n\"Albatross\" turned on her electric lamps the guillemots, ducks, and\ngeese came crowding on board enough to fill Tapage's larder a hundred\ntimes and more.\n\nHere was work for the cook, who knew how to bring out the flavor of\nthe game and keep down its peculiar oiliness. And here was work for\nFrycollin in plucking dozen after dozen of such interesting feathered\nfriends.\n\nThat day, as the sun was setting about three o'clock in the\nafternoon, there appeared in sight a large lake framed in a border of\nsuperb forest. The lake was completely frozen over, and a few natives\nwith long snowshoes on their feet were swiftly gliding over it.\n\nAt the sight of the \"Albatross,\" the Fuegians, overwhelmed with\nterror--scattered in all directions, and when they could not get\naway they hid themselves, taking, like the animals, to the holes in\nthe ground.\n\nThe \"Albatross\" still held her southerly course, crossing the Beagle\nChannel, and Navarin Island and Wollaston Island, on the shores of\nthe Pacific. Then, having accomplished 4,700 miles since she left\nDahomey, she passed the last islands of the Magellanic archipelago,\nwhose most southerly outpost, lashed by the everlasting surf, is the\nterrible Cape Horn.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVII\n\nTHE SHIPWRECKED CREW\n\n\nNext day was the 24th of July; and the 24th of July in the southern\nhemisphere corresponds to the 24th of January in the northern. The\nfifty-sixth degree of latitude had been left behind. The similar\nparallel in northern Europe runs through Edinburgh.\n\nThe thermometer kept steadily below freezing, so that the machinery\nwas called upon to furnish a little artificial heat in the cabins.\nAlthough the days begin to lengthen after the 21st day of June in the\nsouthern hemisphere, yet the advance of the \"Albatross\" towards the\nPole more than neutralized this increase, and consequently the\ndaylight became very short. There was thus very little to be seen. At\nnight time the cold became very keen; but as there was no scarcity of\nclothing on board, the colleagues, well wrapped up, remained a good\ndeal on deck thinking over their plans of escape, and watching for an\nopportunity. Little was seen of Robur; since the high words that had\nbeen exchanged in the Timbuktu country, the engineer had left off\nspeaking to his prisoners. Frycollin seldom came out of the\ncook-house, where Tapage treated him most hospitably, on condition\nthat he acted as his assistant. This position was not without its\nadvantages, and the Negro, with his master's permission, very\nwillingly accepted it. Shut up in the galley, he saw nothing of what\nwas passing outside, and might even consider himself beyond the reach\nof danger. He was, in fact, very like the ostrich, not only in his\nstomach, but in his folly.\n\nBut whither went the \"Albatross?\" Was she in mid-winter bound for the\nsouthern seas or continents round the Pole? In this icy atmosphere,\neven granting that the elements of the batteries were unaffected by\nsuch frost, would not all the crew succumb to a horrible death from\nthe cold? That Robur should attempt to cross the Pole in the warm\nseason was bad enough, but to attempt such a thing in the depth of\nthe winter night would be the act of a madman.\n\nThus reasoned the President and Secretary of the Weldon Institute,\nnow they had been brought to the end of the continent of the New\nWorld, which is still America, although it does not belong to the\nUnited States.\n\nWhat was this intractable Robur going to do? Had not the time arrived\nfor them to end the voyage by blowing up the ship?\n\nIt was noticed that during the 24th of July the engineer had frequent\nconsultations with his mate. He and Tom Turner kept constant watch on\nthe barometer--not so much to keep themselves informed of the height\nat which they were traveling as to be on the look-out for a change in\nthe weather. Evidently some indications had been observed of which it\nwas necessary to make careful note.\n\nUncle Prudent also remarked that Robur had been taking stock of the\nprovisions and stores, and everything seemed to show that he was\ncontemplating turning back.\n\n\"Turning back!\" said Phil Evans. \"But where to?\"\n\n\"Where he can reprovision the ship,\" said Uncle Prudent.\n\n\"That ought to be in some lonely island in the Pacific with a colony\nof scoundrels worthy of their chief.\"\n\n\"That is what I think. I fancy he is going west, and with the speed\nhe can get up it would not take, him long to get home.\"\n\n\"But we should not be able to put our plan into execution. If we get\nthere--\"\n\n\"We shall not get there!\"\n\nThe colleagues had partly guessed the engineer's intentions. During\nthe day it became no longer doubtful that when the \"Albatross\"\nreached the confines of the Antarctic Sea her course was to be\nchanged. When the ice has formed about Cape Horn the lower regions of\nthe Pacific are covered with icefields and icebergs. The floes then\nform an impenetrable barrier to the strongest ships and the boldest\nnavigators. Of course, by increasing the speed of her wings the\n\"Albatross\" could clear the mountains of ice accumulated on the ocean\nas she could the mountains of earth on the polar continent--if it is\na continent that forms the cap of the southern pole. But would she\nattempt it in the middle of the polar night, in an atmosphere of\nsixty below freezing?\n\nAfter she had advanced about a hundred miles to the south the\n\"Albatross\" headed westerly, as if for some unknown island of the\nPacific. Beneath her stretched the liquid plain between Asia and\nAmerica. The waters now had assumed that singular color which has\nearned for them the name of the Milky Sea. In the half shadow, which\nthe enfeebled rays of the sun were unable to dissipate, the surface\nof the Pacific was a milky white. It seemed like a vast snowfield,\nwhose undulations were imperceptible at such a height. If the sea had\nbeen solidified by the cold, and converted into an immense icefield,\nits aspect could not have been much different. They knew that the\nphenomenon was produced by myriads of luminous particles of\nphosphorescent corpuscles; but it was surprising to come across such\nan opalescent mass beyond the limits of the Indian Ocean.\n\nSuddenly the barometer fell after keeping somewhat high during the\nearlier hours of the day. Evidently the indications were such as a\nshipmaster might feel anxious at, though the master of an aeronef\nmight despise them. There was every sign that a terrible storm had\nrecently raged in the Pacific.\n\nIt was one o'clock in the afternoon when Tom Turner came up to the\nengineer and said, \"Do you see that black spot on the horizon, sir--there\naway to due north of us? That is not a rock?\"\n\n\"No, Tom; there is no land out there.\"\n\n\"Then it must be a ship or a boat.\"\n\nUncle Prudent and Phil Evans, who were in the bow, looked in the\ndirection pointed out by the mate.\n\nRobur asked for the glass and attentively observed the object.\n\n\"It is a boat,\" said he, \"and there are some men in it.\"\n\n\"Shipwrecked?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Yes! They have had to abandon their ship, and, knowing nothing of\nthe nearest land, are perhaps dying of hunger and thirst! Well, it\nshall not be said that the \"Albatross\" did not come to their help!\"\n\nThe orders were given, and the aeronef began to sink towards the sea.\nAt three hundred yards from it the descent was stopped, and the\npropellers drove ahead full speed towards the north.\n\nIt was a boat. Her sail flapped against the mast as she rose and fell\non the waves. There was no wind, and she was making no progress.\nDoubtless there was no one on board with strength enough left to work\nthe oars. In the boat were five men asleep or helpless, if they were\nnot dead.\n\nThe \"Albatross\" had arrived above them, and slowly descended. On the\nboat's stern was the name of the ship to which she belonged--the\n\"Jeannette\" of Nantes.\n\n\"Hallo, there!\" shouted Turner, loud enough for the men to hear, for\nthe boat was only eighty feet below him.\n\nThere was no answer. \"Fire a gun!\" said Robur.\n\nThe gun was fired and the report rang out over the sea.\n\nOne of the men looked up feebly. His eyes were haggard and his face\nwas that of a skeleton. As he caught sight of the \"Albatross\" he made\na gesture as of fear.\n\n\"Don't be afraid,\" said Robur in French, \"we have come to help you.\nWho are you?\"\n\n\"We belong to the barque \"Jeannette,\" and I am the mate. We left her\na fortnight ago as she was sinking. We have no water and no food.\"\n\nThe four other men had now sat up. Wan and exhausted, in a terrible\nstate of emaciation, they lifted their hands towards the \"Albatross.\"\n\n\"Look-out!\" shouted Robur.\n\nA line was let down, and a pail of fresh water was lowered into the\nboat. The men snatched at it and drank it with an eagerness awful to\nsee.\n\n\"Bread, bread!\" they exclaimed.\n\nImmediately a basket with some food and five pints of coffee\ndescended towards them. The mate with difficulty restrained them in\ntheir ravenousness.\n\n\"Where are we?\" asked the mate at last.\n\n\"Fifty miles from the Chili coast and the Chonos Archipelago,\"\nanswered Robur.\n\n\"Thanks. But we are becalmed, and--?\"\n\n\"We are going to tow you.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"People who are glad to be of assistance to you,\" said Robur.\n\nThe mate understood that the incognito was to be respected. But had\nthe flying machine sufficient power to tow them through the water?\n\nYes; and the boat, attached to a hundred feet of rope, began to move\noff towards the east. At ten o'clock at night the land was\nsighted--or rather they could see the lights which indicated its position.\nThis rescue from the sky had come just in time for the survivors of\nthe \"Jeannette,\" and they had good reason to believe it miraculous.\n\nWhen they had been taken to the mouth of the channel leading among\nthe Chonos Islands, Robur shouted to them to cast off the tow-line.\nThis, with many a blessing to those who had saved them, they did, and\nthe \"Albatross\" headed out to the offing.\n\nCertainly there was some good in this aeronef, which could thus help\nthose who were lost at sea! What balloon, perfect as it might be,\nwould be able to perform such a service? And between themselves Uncle\nPrudent and Phil Evans could not but admire it, although they were\nquite disposed to deny the evidence of their senses.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVIII\n\nOVER THE VOLCANO\n\n\nThe sea was as rough as ever, and the symptoms became alarming. The\nbarometer fell several millimeters. The wind came in violent gusts,\nand then for a moment or so failed altogether. Under such\ncircumstances a sailing vessel would have had to reef in her topsails\nand her foresail. Everything showed that the wind was rising in the\nnorthwest. The storm-glass became much troubled and its movements\nwere most disquieting.\n\nAt one o'clock in the morning the wind came on again with extreme\nviolence. Although the aeronef was going right in its teeth she was\nstill making progress at a rate of from twelve to fifteen miles an\nhour. But that was the utmost she could do.\n\nEvidently preparations must be made for a cyclone, a very rare\noccurrence in these latitudes. Whether it be called a hurricane, as\nin the Atlantic, a typhoon, as in Chinese waters a simoom, as in the\nSahara, or a tornado, as on the western coast, such a storm is always\na gyratory one, and most dangerous for any ship caught in the current\nwhich increases from the circumference to the center, and has only\none spot of calm, the middle of the vortex.\n\nRobur knew this. He also knew it was best to escape from the cyclone\nand get beyond its zone of attraction by ascending to the higher\nstrata. Up to then he had always succeeded in doing this, but now he\nhad not an hour, perhaps not a minute, to lose.\n\nIn fact the violence of the wind sensibly increased. The crests of\nthe waves were swept off as they rose and blown into white dust on\nthe surface of the sea. It was manifest that the cyclone was\nadvancing with fearful velocity straight towards the regions of the\npole.\n\n\"Higher!\" said Robur.\n\n\"Higher it is,\" said Tom Tumor.\n\nAn extreme ascensional power was communicated to the aeronef, and she\nshot up slantingly as if she was traveling on a plane sloping\ndownwards from the southwest. Suddenly the barometer fell more than a\ndozen millimeters and the \"Albatross\" paused in her ascent.\n\nWhat was the cause of the stoppage? Evidently she was pulled back by\nthe air; some formidable current had diminished the resistance to the\nscrews. When a steamer travels upstream more work is got out of her\nscrew than when the water is running between the blades. The recoil\nis then considerable, and may perhaps be as great as the current. It\nwas thus with the \"Albatross\" at this moment.\n\nBut Robur was not the man to give in. His seventy-four screws,\nworking perfectly together, were driven at their maximum speed. But\nthe aeronef could not escape; the attraction of the cyclone was\nirresistible. During the few moments of calm she began to ascend, but\nthe heavy pull soon drew her back, and she sunk like a ship as she\nfounders.\n\nEvidently if the violence of the cyclone went on increasing the\n\"Albatross\" would be but as a straw caught in one of those whirlwinds\nthat root up the trees, carry off roofs, and blow down walls.\n\nRobur and Tom could only speak by signs. Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans\nclung to the rail and wondered if the cyclone was not playing their\ngame in destroying the aeronef and with her the inventor--and with\nthe inventor the secret of his invention.\n\nBut if the \"Albatross\" could not get out of the cyclone vertically\ncould she not do something else? Could she not gain the center, where\nit was comparatively calm, and where they would have more control\nover her? Quite so, but to do this she would have to break through\nthe circular currents which were sweeping her round with them. Had\nshe sufficient mechanical power to escape through them?\n\nSuddenly the upper part of the cloud fell in. The vapor condensed in\ntorrents of rain. It was two o'clock in the morning. The barometer,\noscillating over a range of twelve millimeters, had now fallen to\n27.91, and from this something should be taken on account of the\nheight of the aeronef above the level of the sea.\n\nStrange to say, the cyclone was out of the zone to which such storms\nare generally restricted, such zone being bounded by the thirtieth\nparallel of north latitude and the twenty-sixth parallel of south\nlatitude. This may perhaps explain why the eddying storm suddenly\nturned into a straight one. But what a hurricane! The tempest in\nConnecticut on the 22nd of March, 1882, could only have been compared\nto it, and the speed of that was more than three hundred miles an\nhour.\n\nThe \"Albatross\" had thus to fly before the wind or rather she had to\nbe left to be driven by the current, from which she could neither\nmount nor escape. But in following this unchanging trajectory she was\nbearing due south, towards those polar regions which Robur had\nendeavored to avoid. And now he was no longer master of her course;\nshe would go where the hurricane took her.\n\nTom Turner was at the helm, and it required all his skill to keep her\nstraight. In the first hours of the morning--if we can so call the\nvague tint which began to rise over the horizon--the \"Albatross\" was\nfifteen degrees below Cape Horn; twelve hundred miles more and she\nwould cross the antarctic circle. Where she was, in this month of\nJuly, the night lasted nineteen hours and a half. The sun's disk--without\nwarmth, without light--only appeared above the horizon to\ndisappear almost immediately. At the pole the night lengthened into\none of a hundred and seventy-nine days. Everything showed that the\n\"Albatross\" was about to plunge into an abyss.\n\nDuring the day an observation, had it been possible, would have given\n66\u00c2\u00b0 40' south latitude. The aeronef was within fourteen hundred miles\nof the pole.\n\nIrresistibly was she drawn towards this inaccessible corner of the\nglobe, her speed eating up, so to speak, her weight, although she\nweighed less than before, owing to the flattening of the earth at the\npole. It seemed as though she could have dispensed altogether with\nher suspensory screws. And soon the fury of the storm reached such a\nheight that Robur thought it best to reduce the speed of her helices\nas much as possible, so as to avoid disaster. And only enough speed\nwas given to keep the aeronef under control of the rudder.\n\nAmid these dangers the engineer retained his imperturbable coolness,\nand the crew obeyed him as if their leader's mind had entered into\nthem. Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans had not for a moment left the\ndeck; they could remain without being disturbed. The air made but\nslight resistance. The aeronef was like an aerostat, which drifts\nwith the fluid masses in which it is plunged.\n\nIs the domain of the southern pole a continent or an archipelago? Or\nis it a palaeocrystic sea, whose ice melts not even during the long\nsummer? We know not. But what we do know is that the southern pole is\ncolder than the northern one--a phenomenon due to the position of\nthe earth in its orbit during winter in the antarctic regions.\n\nDuring this day there was nothing to show that the storm was abating.\nIt was by the seventy-fifth meridian to the west that the \"Albatross\"\ncrossed into the circumpolar region. By what meridian would she come\nout--if she ever came out?\n\nAs she descended more to the south the length of the day diminished.\nBefore long she would be plunged in that continuous night which is\nilluminated only by the rays of the moon or the pale streamers of the\naurora. But the moon was then new, and the companions of Robur might\nsee nothing of the regions whose secret has hitherto defied human\ncuriosity, There was not much inconvenience on board from the cold,\nfor the temperature was not nearly so low as was expected.\n\nIt seemed as though the hurricane was a sort of Gulf Stream, carrying\na certain amount of heat along with it.\n\nGreat was the regret that the whole region was in such profound\nobscurity. Even if the moon had been in full glory but few\nobservations could have been made. At this season of the year an\nimmense curtain of snow, an icy carapace, covers up the polar\nsurface. There was none of that ice \"blink\" to be seen, that whitish\ntint of which the reflection is absent from dark horizons. Under such\ncircumstances, how could they distinguish the shape of the ground,\nthe extent of the seas, the position of the islands? How could they\nrecognize the hydrographic network of the country or the orographic\nconfiguration, and distinguish the hills and mountains from the\nicebergs and floes?\n\nA little after midnight an aurora illuminated the darkness. With its\nsilver fringes and spangles radiating over space, it seemed like a\nhuge fan open over half the sky. Its farthest electric effluences\nwere lost in the Southern Cross, whose four bright stars were\ngleaming overhead. The phenomenon was one of incomparable\nmagnificence, and the light showed the face of the country as a\nconfused mass of white.\n\nIt need not be said that they had approached so near to the pole that\nthe compass was constantly affected, and gave no precise indication\nof the course pursued. Its inclination was such that at one time\nRobur felt certain they were passing over the magnetic pole\ndiscovered by Sir James Ross. And an hour later, in calculating the\nangle the needle made with the vertical, he exclaimed: \"the South\nPole is beneath us!\"\n\nA white cap appeared, but nothing could be seen of what it bid under\nits ice.\n\nA few minutes afterwards the aurora died away, and the point where\nall the world's meridians cross is still to be discovered.\n\nIf Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans wished to bury in the most mysterious\nsolitudes the aeronef and all she bore, the moment was propitious. If\nthey did not do so it was doubtless because the explosive they\nrequired was still denied to them.\n\nThe hurricane still raged and swept along with such rapidity that had\na mountain been met with the aeronef would have been dashed to pieces\nlike a ship on a lee shore. Not only had the power gone to steer her\nhorizontally, but the control of her elevation had also vanished.\n\nAnd it was not unlikely that mountains did exist in these antarctic\nlands. Any instant a shock might happen which would destroy the\n\"Albatross.\" Such a catastrophe became more probable as the wind\nshifted more to the east after they passed the prime meridian. Two\nluminous points then showed themselves ahead of the \"Albatross.\"\nThere were the two volcanos of the Ross Mountains--Erebus and\nTerror. Was the \"Albatross\" to be shriveled up in their flames like a\ngigantic butterfly?\n\nAn hour of intense excitement followed. One of the volcanoes, Erebus,\nseemed to be rushing at the aeronef, which could not move from the\nbed of the hurricane. The cloud of flame grew as they neared it. A\nnetwork of fire barred their road. A brilliant light shone round over\nall. The figures on board stood out in the bright light as if come\nfrom another world. Motionless, without a sound or a gesture, they\nwaited for the terrible moment when the furnace would wrap them in\nits fires.\n\nBut the storm that bore the \"Albatross\" saved them from such a\nfearful fate. The flames of Erebus were blown down by the hurricane\nas it passed, and the \"Albatross\" flew over unhurt. She swept through\na hail of ejected material, which was fortunately kept at bay by the\ncentrifugal action of the suspensory screws. And she harmlessly\npassed over the crater while it was in full eruption.\n\nAn hour afterwards the horizon hid from their view the two colossal\ntorches which light the confines of the world during the long polar\nnight.\n\nAt two o'clock in the morning Balleny Island was sighted on the coast\nof Discovery Land, though it could not be recognized owing to its\nbeing bound to the mainland by a cement of ice.\n\nAnd the \"Albatross\" emerged from the polar circle on the hundred and\nseventy-fifth meridian. The hurricane had carried her over the\nicebergs and icefloes, against which she was in danger of being\ndashed a hundred times or more. She was not in the hands of the\nhelmsman, but in the hand of God--and God is a good pilot.\n\nThe aeronef sped along to the north, and at the sixtieth parallel the\nstorm showed signs of dying away. Its violence sensibly diminished.\nThe \"Albatross\" began to come under control again. And, what was a\ngreat comfort, had again entered the lighted regions of the globe;\nand the day reappeared about eight o'clock in the morning.\n\nRobur had been carried by the storm into the Pacific over the polar\nregion, accomplishing four thousand three hundred and fifty miles in\nnineteen hours, or about three miles a minute, a speed almost double\nthat which the \"Albatross\" was equal to with her propellers under\nordinary circumstances. But he did not know where he then was owing\nto the disturbance of the needle in the neighborhood of the magnetic\npole, and he would have to wait till the sun shone out under\nconvenient conditions for observation. Unfortunately, heavy clouds\ncovered the sky all that day and the sun did not appear.\n\nThis was a disappointment more keenly felt as both propelling screws\nhad sustained damage during the tempest. Robur, much disconcerted at\nthis accident, could only advance at a moderate speed during this\nday, and when he passed over the antipodes of Paris was only going\nabout eighteen miles an hour. It was necessary not to aggravate the\ndamage to the screws, for if the propellers were rendered useless the\nsituation of the aeronef above the vast seas of the Pacific would be\na very awkward one. And the engineer began to consider if he could\nnot effect his repairs on the spot, so as to make sure of continuing\nhis voyage.\n\nIn the morning of the 27th of July, about seven o'clock, land was\nsighted to the north. It was soon seen to be an island. But which\nisland was it of the thousands that dot the Pacific? However, Robur\ndecided to stop at it without landing. He thought, that he could\nrepair damages during the day and start in the evening.\n\nThe wind had died away completely and this was a favorable\ncircumstance for the maneuver he desired to execute. At least, if she\ndid not remain stationary the \"Albatross\" would be carried he knew\nnot where.\n\nA cable one hundred and fifty feet long with an anchor at the end was\ndropped overboard. When the aeronef reached the shore of the island\nthe anchor dragged up the first few rocks and then got firmly fixed\nbetween two large blocks. The cable then stretched to full length\nunder the influence of the suspensory screws, and the \"Albatross\"\nremained motionless, riding like a ship in a roadstead.\n\nIt was the first time she had been fastened to the earth since she\nleft Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIX\n\nANCHORED AT LAST\n\n\nWhen the \"Albatross\" was high in the air the island could be seen to\nbe of moderate size. But on what parallel was it situated? What\nmeridian ran through it? Was it an island in the Pacific, in\nAustralasia, or in the Indian Ocean? When the sun appeared, and Robur\nhad taken his observations, they would know; but although they could\nnot trust to the indications of the compass there was reason to think\nthey were in the Pacific.\n\nAt this height--one hundred and fifty feet--the island which\nmeasured about fifteen miles round, was like a three-pointed star in\nthe sea.\n\nOff the southwest point was an islet and a range of rocks. On the\nshore there were no tide-marks, and this tended to confirm Robur in\nhis opinion as to his position for the ebb and flow are almost\nimperceptible in the Pacific.\n\nAt the northwest point there was a conical mountain about two hundred\nfeet high.\n\nNo natives were to be seen, but they might be on the opposite coast.\nIn any case, if they had perceived the aeronef, terror had made them\neither hide themselves or run away. The \"Albatross\" had anchored on\nthe southwest point of the island. Not far off, down a little creek,\na small river flowed in among the rocks. Beyond were several winding\nvalleys; trees of different kinds; and birds--partridges and\nbustards--in great numbers. If the island was not inhabited it was\nhabitable. Robur might surely have landed on it; if he had not done\nso it was probably because the ground was uneven and did not offer a\nconvenient spot to beach the aeronef.\n\nWhile he was waiting for the sun the engineer began the repairs he\nreckoned on completing before the day was over. The suspensory screws\nwere undamaged and had worked admirably amid all the violence of the\nstorm, which, as we have said, had considerably lightened their work.\nAt this moment half of them were in action, enough to keep the\n\"Albatross\" fixed to the shore by the taut cable. But the two\npropellers had suffered, and more than Robur had thought. Their\nblades would have to be adjusted and the gearing seen to by which\nthey received their rotatory movement.\n\nIt was the screw at the bow which was first attacked under Robur's\nsuperintendence. It was the best to commence with, in case the\n\"Albatross\" had to leave before the work was finished. With only this\npropeller he could easily keep a proper course.\n\nMeanwhile Uncle Prudent and his colleague, after walking about the\ndeck, had sat down aft. Frycollin was strangely reassured. What a\ndifference! To be suspended only one hundred and fifty feet from the\nground!\n\nThe work was only interrupted for a moment while the elevation of the\nsun above the horizon allowed Robur to take an horary angle, so that\nat the time of its culmination he could calculate his position.\n\nThe result of the observation, taken with the greatest exactitude,\nwas as follows:\n\n       Longitude, 176\u00c2\u00b0 10' west.\n       Latitude, 44\u00c2\u00b0 25' south.\n\nThis point on the map answered to the position of the Chatham\nIslands, and particularly of Pitt Island, one of the group.\n\n\"That is nearer than I supposed,\" said Robur to Tom Turner.\n\n\"How far off are we?\"\n\n\"Forty-six degrees south of X Island, or two thousand eight hundred\nmiles.\"\n\n\"All the more reason to get our propellers into order,\" said the\nmate. \"We may have the wind against us this passage, and with the\nlittle stores we have left we ought to get to X as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Yes, Tom, and I hope to get under way tonight, even if I go with one\nscrew, and put the other to-rights on the voyage.\"\n\n\"Mr. Robur,\" said Tom \"What is to be done with those two gentlemen\nand their servant?\"\n\n\"Do you think they would complain if they became colonists of X\nIsland?\"\n\nBut where was this X? It was an island lost in the immensity of the\nPacific Ocean between the Equator and the Tropic of Cancer--an\nisland most appropriately named by Robur in this algebraic fashion.\nIt was in the north of the South Pacific, a long way out of the route\nof inter-oceanic communication. There it was that Robur had founded\nhis little colony, and there the \"Albatross\" rested when tired with\nher flight. There she was provisioned for all her voyages. In X\nIsland, Robur, a man of immense wealth, had established a shipyard in\nwhich he built his aeronef. There he could repair it, and even\nrebuild it. In his warehouses were materials and provisions of all\nsorts stored for the fifty inhabitants who lived on the island.\n\nWhen Robur had doubled Cape Horn a few days before his intention had\nbeen to regain X Island by crossing the Pacific obliquely. But the\ncyclone had seized the \"Albatross,\" and the hurricane had carried her\naway to the south. In fact, he had been brought back to much the same\nlatitude as before, and if his propellers had not been damaged the\ndelay would have been of no importance.\n\nHis object was therefore to get back to X Island, but as the mate had\nsaid, the voyage would be a long one, and the winds would probably be\nagainst them. The mechanical power of the \"Albatross\" was, however,\nquite equal to taking her to her destination, and under ordinary\ncircumstances she would be there in three or four days.\n\nHence Robur's resolve to anchor on the Chatham Islands. There was\nevery opportunity for repairing at least the fore-screw. He had no\nfear that if the wind were to rise he would be driven to the south\ninstead of to the north. When night came the repairs would be\nfinished, and he would have to maneuver so as to weigh anchor. If it\nwere too firmly fixed in the rocks he could cut the cable and resume\nhis flight towards the equator.\n\nThe crew of the \"Albatross,\" knowing there was no time to lose, set\nto work vigorously.\n\nWhile they were busy in the bow of the aeronef, Uncle Prudent and\nPhil Evans held a little conversation together which had\nexceptionally important consequences.\n\n\"Phil Evans,\" said Uncle Prudent, \"you have resolved, as I have, to\nsacrifice your life?\"\n\n\"Yes, like you.\"\n\n\"It is evident that we can expect nothing from Robur.\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Well, Phil Evans, I have made up my mind. If the \"Albatross\" leaves\nthis place tonight, the night will not pass without our having\naccomplished our task. We will smash the wings of this bird of\nRobur's! This night I will blow it into the air!\"\n\n\"The sooner the better,\" said Phil Evans.\n\nIt will be seen that the two colleagues were agreed on all points\neven in accepting with indifference the frightful death in store for\nthem. \"Have you all you want?\" asked Evans.\n\n\"Yes. Last night, while Robur and his people had enough to do to look\nafter the safety of the ship, I slipped into the magazine and got\nhold of a dynamite cartridge.\"\n\n\"Let us set to work, Uncle Prudent.\"\n\n\"No. Wait till tonight. When the night comes we will go into our\ncabin, and you shall see something that will surprise you.\"\n\nAt six o'clock the colleagues dined together as usual. Two hours\nafterwards they retired to their cabin like men who wished to make up\nfor a sleepless night.\n\nNeither Robur nor any of his companions had a suspicion of the\ncatastrophe that threatened the \"Albatross.\"\n\nThis was Uncle Prudent's plan. As he had said, he had stolen into the\nmagazine, and there had possessed himself of some powder and\ncartridge like those used by Robur in Dahomey. Returning to his\ncabin, he had carefully concealed the cartridge with which he had\nresolved to blow up the \"Albatross\" in mid-air.\n\nPhil Evans, screened by his companion, was now examining the infernal\nmachine, which was a metallic canister containing about two pounds of\ndynamite, enough to shatter the aeronef to atoms. If the explosion\ndid not destroy her at once, it would do so in her fall. Nothing was\neasier than to place this cartridge in a corner of the cabin, so that\nit would blow in the deck and tear away the framework of the hull.\n\nBut to obtain the explosion it was necessary to adjust the\nfulminating cap with which the cartridge was fitted. This was the\nmost delicate part of the operation, for the explosion would have to\nbe carefully timed, so as not to occur too soon or too late.\n\nUncle Prudent had carefully thought over the matter. His conclusions\nwere as follows. As soon as the fore propeller was repaired the\naeronef would resume her course to the north, and that done Robur and\nhis crew would probably come aft to put the other screw into order.\nThe presence of these people about the cabin might interfere with his\nplans, and so he had resolved to make a slow match do duty as a\ntime-fuse.\n\n\"When I got the cartridge,\" said he to Phil Evans, \"I took some\ngunpowder as well. With the powder I will make a fuse that will take\nsome time to burn, and which will lead into the fulminate. My idea is\nto light it about midnight, so that the explosion will take place\nabout three or four o'clock in the morning.\"\n\n\"Well planned!\" said Phil Evans.\n\nThe colleagues, as we see, had arrived at such a stage as to look with\nthe greatest nonchalance on the awful destruction in which they were\nabout to perish. Their hatred against Robur and his people had so\nincreased that they would sacrifice their own lives to destroy the\n\"Albatross\" and all she bore. The act was that of madmen, it was\nhorrible; but at such a pitch had they arrived after five weeks of\nanger that could not vent itself, of rage that could not be gratified.\n\n\"And Frycollin?\" asked Phil Evans, \"have we the right to dispose of\nhis life?\"\n\n\"We shall sacrifice ours as well!\" said Uncle Prudent. But it is\ndoubtful if Frycollin would have thought the reason sufficient.\n\nImmediately Uncle Prudent set to work, while Evans kept watch in the\nneighborhood of the cabin. The crew were all at work forward. There\nwas no fear of being surprised. Uncle Prudent began by rubbing a\nsmall quantity of the powder very fine; and then, having slightly\nmoistened it, he wrapped it up in a piece of rag in the shape of a\nmatch. When it was lighted he calculated it would burn about an inch\nin five minutes, or a yard in three hours. The match was tried and\nfound to answer, and was then wound round with string and attached to\nthe cap of the cartridge. Uncle Prudent had all finished about ten\no'clock in the evening without having excited the least suspicion.\n\nDuring the day the work on the fore screw had been actively carried\non, but it had had to be taken on board to adjust the twisted blades.\nOf the piles and accumulators and the machinery that drove the ship\nnothing was damaged.\n\nWhen night fell Robur and his men knocked off work. The fore\npropeller not been got into place, and to finish it would take\nanother three hours. After some conversation with Tom Turner it was\ndecided to give the crew a rest, and postpone what required to be\ndone to the next morning.\n\nThe final adjustment was a matter of extreme nicety, and the electric\nlamps did not give so suitable a light for such work as the daylight.\n\nUncle Prudent and Phil Evans were not aware of this. They had\nunderstood that the screw would be in place during the night, and\nthat the \"Albatross\" would be on her way to the north.\n\nThe night was dark and moonless. Heavy clouds made the darkness\ndeeper. A light breeze began to rise. A few puffs came from the\nsouthwest, but they had no effect on the \"Albatross.\" She remained\nmotionless at her anchor, and the cable stretched vertically downward\nto the ground.\n\nUncle Prudent and his colleague, imagining they were under way again,\nsat shut up in their cabin, exchanging but a few words, and listening\nto the f-r-r-r-r of the suspensory screws, which drowned every other\nsound on board. They were waiting till the time of action arrived.\n\nA little before midnight Uncle Prudent said, \"It is time!\" Under the\nberths in the cabin was a sliding box, forming a small locker, and in\nthis locker Uncle Prudent put the dynamite and the slow-match. In\nthis way the match would burn without betraying itself by its smoke\nor spluttering. Uncle Prudent lighted the end and pushed back the box\nunder the berth with \"Now let us go aft, and wait.\"\n\nThey then went out, and were astonished not to find the steersman at\nhis post.\n\nPhil Evans leant out over the rail.\n\n\"The \"Albatross\" is where she was,\" said he in a low voice. \"The work\nis not finished. They have not started!\"\n\nUncle Prudent made a gesture of disappointment. \"We shall have to put\nout the match,\" said he.\n\n\"No,\" said Phil Evans, \"we must escape!\"\n\n\"Escape?\"\n\n\"Yes! down the cable! Fifty yards is nothing!\"\n\n\"Nothing, of course, Phil Evans, and we should be fools not to take\nthe chance now it has come.\"\n\nBut first they went back to the cabin and took away all they could\ncarry, with a view to a more or less prolonged stay on the Chatham\nIslands. Then they shut the door and noiselessly crept forward,\nintending to wake Frycollin and take him with them.\n\nThe darkness was intense. The clouds were racing up from the\nsouthwest, and the aeronef was tugging at her anchor and thus\nthrowing the cable more and more out of the vertical. There would be\nno difficulty in slipping down it.\n\nThe colleagues made their way along the deck, stopping in the shadow\nof the deckhouses to listen if there was any sound. The silence was\nunbroken. No light shone from the portholes. The aeronef was not only\nsilent; she was asleep.\n\nUncle Prudent was close to Frycollin's cabin when Phil Evans stopped\nhim. \"The look-out!\" he said.\n\nA man was crouching near the deck-house. He was only half asleep. All\nflight would be impossible if he were to give the alarm. Close by\nwere a few ropes, and pieces of rag and waste used in the work at the\nscrew.\n\nAn instant afterwards the man was gagged and blindfolded and lashed\nto the rail unable to utter a sound or move an inch. This was done\nalmost without a whisper.\n\nUncle Prudent and Phil Evans listened. All was silent within the\ncabins. Every one on board was asleep. They reached Frycollin's\ncabin. Tapage was snoring away in a style worthy of his name, and\nthat promised well.\n\nTo his great surprise, Uncle Prudent had not even to push Frycollin's\ndoor. It was open. He stepped into the doorway and looked around.\n\"Nobody here!\" he said.\n\n\"Nobody! Where can he be?\" asked Phil Evans.\n\nThey went into the bow, thinking Frycollin might perhaps be asleep in\nthe corner. Still they found nobody.\n\n\"Has the fellow got the start of us?\" asked Uncle Prudent.\n\n\"Whether he has or not,\" said Phil Evans, \"we can't wait any longer.\nDown you go.\"\n\nWithout hesitation the fugitives one after the other clambered over\nthe side and, seizing the cable with hands and feet slipped down it\nsafe and sound to the ground.\n\nThink of their joy at again treading the earth they had lost for so\nlong--at walking on solid ground and being no longer the playthings\nof the atmosphere!\n\nThey were staring up the creek to the interior of the island when\nsuddenly a form rose in front of them. It was Frycollin. The Negro\nhad had the same idea as his master and the audacity to start without\ntelling him. But there was no time for recriminations, and Uncle\nPrudent was in search of a refuge in some distant part of the island\nwhen Phil Evans stopped him.\n\n\"Uncle Prudent,\" said he. \"Here we are safe from Robur. He is doomed\nlike his companions to a terrible death. He deserves it, we know. But\nif he would swear on his honor not to take us prisoners again--\"\n\n\"The honor of such a man--\"\n\nUncle Prudent did not finish his sentence.\n\nThere was a noise on the \"Albatross.\" Evidently, the alarm had been\ngiven. The escape was discovered.\n\n\"Help! Help!\" shouted somebody. It was the look-out man, who had got\nrid of his gag. Hurried footsteps were heard on deck. Almost\nimmediately the electric lamps shot beams over a large circle.\n\n\"There they are! There they are!\" shouted Tom Turner. The fugitives\nwere seen.\n\nAt the same instant an order was given by Robur, and the suspensory\nscrews being slowed, the cable was hauled in on board, and the\n\"Albatross\" sank towards the ground.\n\nAt this moment the voice of Phil Evans was heard shouting, \"Engineer\nRobur, will you give us your word of honor to leave us free on this\nisland?\"\n\n\"Never!\" said Robur. And the reply was followed by the report of a\ngun, and the bullet grazed Phil's shoulder.\n\n\"Ah! The brutes!\" said Uncle Prudent. Knife in hand, he rushed\ntowards the rocks where the anchor had fixed itself. The aeronef was\nnot more than fifty feet from the ground.\n\nIn a few seconds the cable was cut, and the breeze, which had\nincreased considerably, striking the \"Albatross\" on the quarter,\ncarried her out over the sea.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XX\n\nTHE WRECK OF THE ALBATROSS\n\n\nIt was then twenty minutes after midnight. Five or six shots had been\nfired from the aeronef. Uncle Prudent and Frycollin, supporting Phil\nEvans, had taken shelter among the rocks. They had not been hit. For\nthe moment there was nothing to fear.\n\nAs the \"Albatross\" drifted off from Pitt Island she rose obliquely to\nnearly three thousand feet. It was necessary to increase the\nascensional power to prevent her falling into the sea.\n\nWhen the look-out man had got clear of his gag and shouted, Robur and\nTom Turner had rushed up to him and torn off his bandage. The mate\nhad then run back to the stern cabin. It was empty! Tapage had\nsearched Frycollin's cabin, and that also was empty.\n\nWhen he saw that the prisoners had escaped, Robur was seized with a\nparoxysm of anger. The escape meant the revelation of his secret to\nthe world. He had not been much concerned at the document thrown\noverboard while they were crossing Europe, for there were so many\nchances that it would be lost in its fall; but now!\n\nAs he grew calm, \"They have escaped,\" said he. \"Be it so! But they\ncannot get away from Pitt Island, and in a day or so I will go back!\nI will recapture them! And then--\"\n\nIn fact, the safety of the three fugitives was by no means assured.\nThe \"Albatross\" would be repaired, and return well in hand. Before\nthe day was out they might again be in the power of the engineer.\n\nBefore the day was out! But in two hours the \"Albatross\" would be\nannihilated! The dynamite cartridge was like a torpedo fastened to\nher hull, and would accomplish her destruction in mid-air. The breeze\nfreshened, and the aeronef was carried to the northeast. Although her\nspeed was but moderate, she would be out of sight of the Chatham\nIslands before sunrise. To return against the wind she must have her\npropellers going, particularly the one in the bow.\n\n\"Tom,\" said the engineer, \"turn the lights full on.\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir.\"\n\n\"And all hands to work.\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir.\"\n\nThere was no longer any idea of putting off the work till tomorrow.\nThere was now no thought of fatigue. Not one of the men of the\n\"Albatross\" failed to share in the feelings of his chief. Not one but\nwas ready to do anything to recapture the fugitives!\n\nAs soon as the screw was in place they would return to the island and\ndrop another anchor, and give chase to the fugitives. Then only would\nthey begin repairing the stern-screw; and then the aeronef could\nresume her voyage across the Pacific to X Island.\n\nIt was important, above all things, that the \"Albatross\" should not\nbe carried too far to the northeast, but unfortunately the breeze\ngrew stronger, and she could not head against it, or even remain\nstationary. Deprived of her propellers she was an unguidable balloon.\nThe fugitives on the shore knew that she would have disappeared\nbefore the explosion blew her to pieces.\n\nRobur felt much disappointment at seeing his plans so interfered\nwith. Would it not take him much longer than he thought to get back\nto his old anchorage?\n\nWhile the work at the screw was actively pushed on, he resolved to\ndescend to the surface of the sea, in the hope that the wind would\nthere be lighter. Perhaps the \"Albatross\" would be able to remain in\nthe neighborhood until she was again fit to work to windward.\n\nThe maneuver was instantly executed. If a passing ship had sighted\nthe aerial machine as she sunk through the air, with her electric\nlights in full blaze, with what terror would she have been seized!\n\nWhen the \"Albatross\" was a few hundred feet from the waves she\nstopped. Unfortunately Robur found that the breeze was stronger here\nthan above, and the aeronef drifted off more rapidly. He risked being\nblown a long, way off to the northeast, and that would delay his\nreturn to Pitt Island. In short, after several experiments, he found\nit better to keep his ship well up in the air, and the \"Albatross\"\nwent aloft to about ten thousand feet. There, if she did not remain\nstationary, the drifting was very slight. The engineer could thus\nhope that by sunrise at such an altitude he would still be in sight\nof the island.\n\nRobur did not trouble himself about the reception the fugitives might\nhave received from the natives--if there were any natives. That they\nmight help them mattered little to him. With the powers of offense\npossessed by the \"Albatross\" they would be promptly terrified and\ndispersed. The capture of the prisoners was certain, and once he had\nthem again, \"They will not escape from X Island!\"\n\nAbout one o'clock in the morning the fore-screw was finished, and all\nthat had to be done was to get it back to its place. This would take\nabout an hour. That done, the \"Albatross\" would be headed southwest\nand the stern-screw could be taken in hand.\n\nAnd how about the match that was burning in the deserted cabin? The\nmatch of which more than a third was now consumed? And the spark that\nwas creeping along to the dynamite?\n\nAssuredly if the men of the aeronef had not been so busy one of them\nwould have heard the feeble sputtering that was going on in the\ndeck-house. Perhaps he would have smelt the burning powder! He would\ndoubtless have become uneasy! And told Tom Turner! And then they\nwould have looked about, and found the box and the infernal machine;\nand then there would have been time to save this wonderful\n\"Albatross\" and all she bore!\n\nBut the men were at work in the bow, twenty yards away from the\ncabin. Nothing brought them to that part of the deck; nothing called\noff their attention from their work. Robur was there working with his\nhands, excellent mechanic as he was. He hurried on the work, but\nnothing was neglected, everything was carefully done. Was it not\nnecessary that he should again become absolute master of his\ninvention? If he did not recapture the fugitives they would get away\nhome. They would begin inquiring into matters. They might even\ndiscover X Island, and there would be an end to this life, which the\nmen of the \"Albatross\" had created for themselves, a life that seemed\nsuperhuman and sublime.\n\nTom Turner came up to the engineer. It was a quarter past one. \"It\nseems to me, sir, that the breeze is falling, and going round to the\nwest.\"\n\n\"What does the barometer say?\" asked Robur, after looking up at the\nsky.\n\n\"It is almost stationary, and the clouds seem gathering below us.\"\n\n\"So they are, and it may be raining down at the sea; but if we keep\nabove the rain it makes no difference to us. It will not interfere\nwith the work.\"\n\n\"If it is raining it is not a heavy rain,\" said Tom. \"The clouds do\nnot look like it, and probably the wind has dropped altogether.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so, but I think we had better not go down yet. Let us get\ninto going order as soon as we can, and then we can do as we like.\"\n\nAt a few minutes after two the first part of the work was finished.\nThe fore-screw was in its place, and the power was turned on. The\nspeed was gradually increased, and the \"Albatross,\" heading to the\nsouthwest, returned at moderate speed towards the Chatham Islands.\n\n\"Tom,\" said Robur, \"it is about two hours and a half since we got\nadrift. The wind has not changed all the time. I think we ought to be\nover the island in an hour.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. We are going about forty feet a second. We ought to be\nthere about half-past three.\"\n\n\"All the better. It would suit us best to get back while it is dark,\nand even beach the \"Albatross\" if we can. Those fellows will fancy we\nare a long way off to the northward, and never think of keeping a\nlook-out. If we have to stop a day or two on the island--\"\n\n\"We'll stop, and if we have to fight an army of natives?\"\n\n\"We'll fight,\" said Robur. \"We'll fight then for our \"Albatross.\"\"\n\nThe engineer went forward to the men, who were waiting for orders.\n\"My lads,\" he said to them, \"we cannot knock off yet. We must work\ntill day comes.\"\n\nThey were all ready to do so. The stern-screw had now to be treated\nas the other had been. The damage was the same, a twisting from the\nviolence of the hurricane during the passage across the southern pole.\n\nBut to get the screw on board it seemed best to stop the progress of\nthe aeronef for a few minutes, and even to drive her backwards. The\nengines were reversed. The aeronef began to fall astern, when Tom\nTurner was surprised by a peculiar odor.\n\nThis was from the gas given off by the match, which had accumulated\nin the box, and was now escaping from the cabin. \"Hallo!\" said the\nmate, with a sniff.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Robur.\n\n\"Don't you smell something? Isn't it burning powder?\"\n\n\"So it is, Tom.\"\n\n\"And it comes from that cabin.\"\n\n\"Yes, the very cabin--\"\n\n\"Have those scoundrels set it on fire?\"\n\n\"Suppose it is something else!\" exclaimed Robur. \"Force the door,\nTom; drive in the door!\"\n\nBut the mate had not made one step towards it when a fearful\nexplosion shook the \"Albatross.\" The cabins flew into splinters. The\nlamps went out. The electric current suddenly failed. The darkness\nwas complete. Most of the suspensory screws were twisted or broken,\nbut a few in the bow still revolved.\n\nAt the same instant the hull of the aeronef opened just behind the\nfirst deck-house, where the engines for the fore-screw were placed;\nand the after-part of the deck collapsed in space.\n\nImmediately the last suspensory screw stopped spinning, and the\n\"Albatross\" dropped into the abyss.\n\nIt was a fall of ten thousand feet for the eight men who were\nclinging to the wreck; and the fall was even faster than it might\nhave been, for the fore propeller was vertical in the air and still\nworking!\n\nIt was then that Robur, with extraordinary coolness, climbed up to\nthe broken deck-house, and seizing the lever reversed the rotation,\nso that the propeller became a suspender. The fall continued, but it\nwas checked, and the wreck did not fall with the accelerating\nswiftness of bodies influenced solely by gravitation; and if it was\ndeath to the survivors of the \"Albatross\" from their being hurled\ninto the sea, it was not death by asphyxia amid air which the\nrapidity of descent rendered unbreathable.\n\nEighty seconds after the explosion, all that remained of the\n\"Albatross\" plunged into the waves!\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXI\n\nTHE INSTITUTE AGAIN\n\n\nSome weeks before, on the 13th of June, on the morning after the\nsitting during which the Weldon Institute had been given over to such\nstormy discussions, the excitement of all classes of the Philadelphia\npopulation, black or white, had been much easier to imagine than to\ndescribe.\n\nFrom a very early hour conversation was entirely occupied with the\nunexpected and scandalous incident of the night before. A stranger\ncalling himself an engineer, and answering to the name of Robur, a\nperson of unknown origin, of anonymous nationality, had unexpectedly\npresented himself in the club-room, insulted the balloonists, made\nfun of the aeronauts, boasted of the marvels of machines heavier than\nair, and raised a frightful tumult by the remarks with which he\ngreeted the menaces of his adversaries. After leaving the desk, amid\na volley of revolver shots, he had disappeared, and in spite of every\nendeavor, no trace could be found of him.\n\nAssuredly here was enough to exercise every tongue and excite every\nimagination. But by how much was this excitement increased when in\nthe evening of the 13th of June it was found that neither the\npresident nor secretary of the Weldon Institute had returned to their\nhomes! Was it by chance only that they were absent? No, or at least\nthere was nothing to lead people to think so. It had even been agreed\nthat in the morning they would be back at the club, one as president,\nthe other as secretary, to take their places during a discussion on\nthe events of the preceding evening.\n\nAnd not only was there the complete disappearance of these two\nconsiderable personages in the state of Pennsylvania, but there was\nno news of the valet Frycollin. He was as undiscoverable as his\nmaster. Never had a Negro since Toussaint L'Ouverture, Soulouque, or\nDessaline had so much talked about him.\n\nThe next day there was no news. Neither the colleagues nor Frycollin\nhad been found. The anxiety became serious. Agitation commenced. A\nnumerous crowd besieged the post and telegraph offices in case any\nnews should be received. There was no news.\n\nAnd they had been seen coming out of the Weldon Institute loudly\ntalking together, and with Frycollin in attendance, go down Walnut\nStreet towards Fairmount Park! Jem Chip, the vegetarian, had even\nshaken hands with the president and left him with \"Tomorrow!\"\n\nAnd William T. Forbes, the manufacturer of sugar from rags, had\nreceived a cordial shake from Phil Evans who had said to him twice,\n\"Au revoir! Au revoir!\"\n\nMiss Doll and Miss Mat Forbes, so attached to Uncle Prudent by the\nbonds of purest friendship, could not get over the disappearance, and\nin order to obtain news of the absent, talked even more than they\nwere accustomed to.\n\nThree, four, five, six days passed. Then a week, then two weeks, and\nthere was nothing to give a clue to the missing three. The most\nminute search had been made in every quarter. Nothing! In the park,\neven under the trees and brushwood. Nothing! Always nothing! Although\nhere it was noticed that the grass looked to be pressed down in a way\nthat seemed suspicious and certainly was inexplicable; and at the\nedge of the clearing there were traces of a recent struggle. Perhaps\na band of scoundrels had attacked the colleagues here in the deserted\npark in the middle of the night!\n\nIt was possible. The police proceeded with their inquiries in all due\nform and with all lawful slowness. They dragged the Schuyllkill\nriver, and cut into the thick bushes that fringe its banks; and if\nthis was useless it was not quite a waste, for the Schuyllkill is in\ngreat want of a good weeding, and it got it on this occasion.\nPractical people are the authorities of Philadelphia!\n\nThen the newspapers were tried. Advertisements and notices and\narticles were sent to all the journals in the Union without\ndistinction of color. The \"Daily Negro,\" the special organ of the\nblack race, published a portrait of Frycollin after his latest\nphotograph. Rewards were offered to whoever would give news of the\nthree absentees, and even to those who would find some clue to put\nthe police on the track. \"Five thousand dollars! Five thousand\ndollars to any citizen who would--\"\n\nNothing was done. The five thousand dollars remained with the\ntreasurer of the Weldon Institute.\n\nUndiscoverable! Undiscoverable! Undiscoverable! Uncle Prudent and\nPhil Evans, of Philadelphia!\n\nIt need hardly be said that the club was put to serious inconvenience\nby this disappearance of its president and secretary. And at first\nthe assembly voted urgency to a measure which suspended the work on\nthe \"Go-Ahead.\" How, in the absence of the principal promoters of the\naffair, of those who had devoted to the enterprise a certain part of\ntheir fortune in time and money--how could they finish the work when\nthese were not present? It were better, then, to wait.\n\nAnd just then came the first news of the strange phenomenon which had\nexercised people's minds some weeks before. The mysterious object\nhad been again seen at different times in the higher regions of the\natmosphere. But nobody dreamt of establishing a connection between\nthis singular reappearance and the no less singular disappearance of\nthe members of the Weldon Institute. In fact, it would have required\na very strong dose of imagination to connect one of these facts with\nthe other.\n\nWhatever it might be, asteroid or aerolite or aerial monster, it had\nreappeared in such a way that its dimensions and shape could be much\nbetter appreciated, first in Canada, over the country between Ottawa\nand Quebec, on the very morning after the disappearance of the\ncolleagues, and later over the plains of the Far West, where it had\ntried its speed against an express train on the Union Pacific.\n\nAt the end of this day the doubts of the learned world were at an\nend. The body was not a product of nature, it was a flying machine,\nthe practical application of the theory of \"heavier than air.\" And if\nthe inventor of the aeronef had wished to keep himself unknown he\ncould evidently have done better than to try it over the Far West. As\nto the mechanical force he required, or the engines by which it was\ncommunicated, nothing was known, but there could be no doubt the\naeronef was gifted with an extraordinary faculty of locomotion. In\nfact, a few days afterwards it was reported from the Celestial\nEmpire, then from the southern part of India, then from the Russian\nsteppes.\n\nWho was then this bold mechanician that possessed such powers of\nlocomotion, for whom States had no frontiers and oceans no limits,\nwho disposed of the terrestrial atmosphere as if it were his domain?\nCould it be this Robur whose theories had been so brutally thrown in\nthe face of the Weldon Institute the day he led the attack against\nthe utopia of guidable balloons? Perhaps such a notion occurred to\nsome of the wide-awake people, but none dreamt that the said Robur\nhad anything to do with the disappearance of the president and\nsecretary of the Institute.\n\nThings remained in this state of mystery when a telegram arrived from\nFrance through the New York cable at 11-37 A.M. on July 13. And what\nwas this telegram? It was the text of the document found at Paris in\na snuff-box revealing what had happened to the two personages for\nwhom the Union was in mourning.\n\nSo, then, the perpetrator of this kidnapping \"was\" Robur the\nengineer, come expressly to Philadelphia to destroy in its egg the\ntheory of the balloonists. He it was who commanded the \"Albatross!\"\nHe it was who carried off by way of reprisal Uncle Prudent, Phil\nEvans and Frycollin; and they might be considered lost for ever. At\nleast until some means were found of constructing an engine capable\nof contending with this powerful machine their terrestrial friends\nwould never bring them back to earth.\n\nWhat excitement! What stupor! The telegram from Paris had been\naddressed to the members of the Weldon Institute. The members of the\nclub were immediately informed of it. Ten minutes later all\nPhiladelphia received the news through its telephones, and in less\nthan an hour all America heard of it through the innumerable electric\nwires of the new continent.\n\nNo one would believe it! \"It is an unseasonable joke,\" said some. \"It\nis all smoke,\" said others. How could such a thing be done in\nPhiladelphia, and so secretly, too? How could the \"Albatross\" have\nbeen beached in Fairmount Park without its appearance having been\nsignaled all over Pennsylvania?\n\nVery good. These were the arguments. The incredulous had the right of\ndoubting. But the right did not last long. Seven days after the\nreceipt of the telegram the French mail-boat \"Normandie\" came into the\nHudson, bringing the famous snuff-box. The railway took it in all\nhaste from New York to Philadelphia.\n\nIt was indeed the snuff-box of the President of the Weldon Institute.\nJem Chip would have done on at day to take some more substantial\nnourishment, for he fell into a swoon when he recognized it. How many\na time had he taken from it the pinch of friendship! And Miss Doll\nand Miss Mat also recognized it, and so did William T. Forbes, Truck\nMilnor, Bat T. Fynn, and many other members. And not only was it the\npresident's snuff-box, it was the president's writing!\n\nThen did the people lament and stretch out their hands in despair to\nthe skies. Uncle Prudent and his colleague carried away in a flying\nmachine, and no one able to deliver them!\n\nThe Niagara Falls Company, in which Uncle Prudent was the largest\nshareholder, thought of suspending its business and turning off its\ncataracts. The Wheelton Watch Company thought of winding up its\nmachinery, now it had lost its manager.\n\nNothing more was heard of the aeronef. July passed, and there was no\nnews. August ran its course, and the uncertainty on the subject of\nRobur's prisoners was as great as ever. Had he, like Icarus, fallen a\nvictim to his own temerity?\n\nThe first twenty-seven days of September went by without result, but\non the 28th a rumor spread through Philadelphia that Uncle Prudent\nand Phil Evans had during the afternoon quietly walked into the\npresident's house. And, what was more extraordinary, the rumor was\ntrue, although very few believed it.\n\nThey had, however, to give in to the evidence. There could be no\ndoubt these were the two men, and not their shadows. And Frycollin\nalso had come back! The members of the club, then their friends, then\nthe crowd, swarmed into the president's house, and shook hands with\nthe president and secretary, and cheered them again and again. Jem\nChip was there, having left his luncheon's joint of boiled lettuces,\nand William T. Forbes and his daughters, and all the members of the\nclub. It is a mystery how Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans emerged alive\nfrom the thousands who welcomed them.\n\nOn that evening was the weekly meeting of the Institute. It was\nexpected that the colleagues would take their places at the desk. As\nthey had said nothing of their adventures, it was thought they would\nthen speak, and relate the impressions of their voyage. But for some\nreason or other both were silent. And so also was Frycollin, whom his\ncongeners in their delirium had failed to dismember.\n\nBut though the colleagues did not tell what had happened to them,\nthat is no reason why we should not. We know what occurred on the\nnight of the 27th and 28th of July; the daring escape to the earth,\nthe scramble among the rocks, the bullet fired at Phil Evans, the cut\ncable, and the \"Albatross\" deprived of her propellers, drifting off\nto the northeast at a great altitude. Her electric lamps rendered her\nvisible for some time. And then she disappeared.\n\nThe fugitives had little to fear. Now could Robur get back to the\nisland for three or four hours if his screws were out of gear? By\nthat time the \"Albatross\" would have been destroyed by the explosion,\nand be no more than a wreck floating on the sea; those whom she bore\nwould be mangled corpses, which the ocean would not even give up\nagain. The act of vengeance would be accomplished.\n\nUncle Prudent and Phil Evans looked upon it as an act of legitimate\nself-defence, and felt no remorse whatever. Evans was but slightly\nwounded by the rifle bullet, and the three made their way up from the\nshore in the hope of meeting some of the natives. The hope was\nrealized. About fifty natives were living by fishing off the western\ncoast. They had seen the aeronef descend on the island, and they\nwelcomed the fugitives as if they were supernatural beings. They\nworshipped them, we ought rather to say. They accommodated them in\nthe most comfortable of their huts.\n\nAs they had expected, Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans saw nothing more\nof the aeronef. They concluded that the catastrophe had taken place\nin some high region of the atmosphere, and that they would hear no\nmore of Robur and his prodigious machine.\n\nMeanwhile they had to wait for an opportunity of returning to\nAmerica. The Chatham Islands are not much visited by navigators, and\nall August passed without sign of a ship. The fugitives began to ask\nthemselves if they had not exchanged one prison for another.\n\nAt last a ship came to water at the Chatham Islands. It will not have\nbeen forgotten that when Uncle Prudent was seized he had on him\nseveral thousand paper dollars, much more than would take him back to\nAmerica. After thanking their adorers, who were not sparing of their\nmost respectful demonstrations, Uncle Prudent, Phil Evans, and\nFrycollin embarked for Auckland. They said nothing of their\nadventures, and in two weeks landed in New Zealand.\n\nAt Auckland, a mail-boat took them on board as passengers, and after\na splendid passage the survivors of the \"Albatross\" stepped ashore at\nSan Francisco. They said nothing as to who they were or whence they\nhad come, but as they had paid full price for their berths no\nAmerican captain would trouble them further. At San Francisco they\ntook the first train out on the Pacific Railway, and on the 27th of\nSeptember, they arrived at Philadelphia, That is the compendious\nhistory of what had occurred since the escape of the fugitives. And\nthat is why this very evening the president and secretary of the\nWeldon Institute took their seats amid a most extraordinary\nattendance.\n\nNever before had either of them been so calm. To look at them it did\nnot seem as though anything abnormal had happened since the memorable\nsitting of the 12th of June. Three months and a half had gone, and\nseemed to be counted as nothing. After the first round of cheers,\nwhich both received without showing the slightest emotion, Uncle\nPrudent took off his hat and spoke.\n\n\"Worthy citizens,\" said he, \"the meeting is now open.\"\n\nTremendous applause. And properly so, for if it was not extraordinary\nthat the meeting was open, it was extraordinary that it should be\nopened by Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans.\n\nThe president allowed the enthusiasm to subside in shouts and\nclappings; then he continued: \"At our last meeting, gentlemen, the\ndiscussion was somewhat animated--(hear, hear)--between the\npartisans of the screw before and those of the screw behind for our\nballoon the \"Go-Ahead.\" (Marks of surprise.) We have found a way to\nbring the beforists and the behindists in agreement. That way is as\nfollows: we are going to use two screws, one at each end of the\ncar.\" Silence, and complete stupefaction.\n\nThat was all.\n\nYes, all! Of the kidnapping of the president and secretary of the\nWeldon Institute not a word! Not a word of the \"Albatross\" nor of\nRobur! Not a word of the voyage! Not a word of the way in which the\nprisoners had escaped! Not a word of what had become of the aeronef,\nif it still flew through space, or if they were to be prepared for\nnew reprisals on the member's of the club!\n\nOf course the balloonists were longing to ask Uncle Prudent and the\nsecretary about all these things, but they looked so close and so\nserious that they thought it best to respect their attitude. When\nthey thought fit to speak they would do so, and it would be an honor\nto hear. After all, there might be in all this some secret which\nwould not yet be divulged.\n\nAnd then Uncle Prudent, resuming his speech amid a silence up to then\nunknown in the meetings of the Weldon Institute, said, \"Gentlemen, it\nnow only remains for us to finish the aerostat 'Go-Ahead.' It is left\nto her to effect the conquest of the air! The meeting is at an end!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXII\n\nTHE GO-AHEAD IS LAUNCHED\n\n\nOn the following 19th of April, seven months after the unexpected\nreturn of Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans, Philadelphia was in a state\nof unwonted excitement. There were neither elections nor meetings\nthis time. The aerostat \"Go-Ahead,\" built by the Weldon Institute,\nwas to take possession of her natural element.\n\nThe celebrated Harry W. Tinder, whose name we mentioned at the\nbeginning of this story, had been engaged as aeronaut. He had no\nassistant, and the only passengers were to be the president and\nsecretary of the Weldon Institute.\n\nDid they not merit such an honor? Did it not come to them\nappropriately to rise in person to protest against any apparatus that\nwas heavier than air?\n\nDuring the seven months, however, they had said nothing of their\nadventures; and even Frycollin had not uttered a whisper of Robur and\nhis wonderful clipper. Probably Uncle Prudent and his friend desired\nthat no question should arise as to the merits of the aeronef, or any\nother flying machine.\n\nAlthough the \"Go-Ahead\" might not claim the first place among aerial\nlocomotives, they would have nothing to say about the inventions of\nother aviators. They believed, and would always believe, that the\ntrue atmospheric vehicle was the aerostat, and that to it alone\nbelonged the future.\n\nBesides, he on whom they had been so terribly--and in their idea so\njustly--avenged, existed no longer. None of those who accompanied\nhim had survived. The secret of the \"Albatross\" was buried in the\ndepths of the Pacific!\n\nThat Robur had a retreat, an island in the middle of that vast ocean,\nwhere he could put into port, was only a hypothesis; and the\ncolleagues reserved to themselves the right of making inquiries on\nthe subject later on. The grand experiment which the Weldon Institute\nhad been preparing for so long was at last to take place. The\n\"Go-Ahead\" was the most perfect type of what had up to then been\ninvented in aerostatic art--she was what an \"Inflexible\" or a\n\"Formidable\" is in ships of war.\n\nShe possessed all the qualities of a good aerostat. Her dimensions\nallowed of her rising to the greatest height a balloon could attain;\nher impermeability enabled her to remain for an indefinite time in\nthe atmosphere; her solidity would defy any dilation of gas or\nviolence of wind or rain; her capacity gave her sufficient\nascensional force to lift with all their accessories an electric\nengine that would communicate to her propellers a power superior to\nanything yet obtained. The \"Go-Ahead\" was of elongated form, so as to\nfacilitate her horizontal displacement. Her car was a platform\nsomewhat like that of the balloon used by Krebs and Renard; and it\ncarried all the necessary outfit, instruments, cables, grapnels,\nguide-ropes, etc., and the piles and accumulators for the mechanical\npower. The car had a screw in front, and a screw and rudder behind.\nBut probably the work done by the machines would be very much less\nthan that done by the machines of the \"Albatross.\"\n\nThe \"Go-Ahead\" had been taken to the clearing in Fairmount Park, to\nthe very spot where the aeronef had landed for a few hours.\n\nHer ascensional power was due to the very lightest of gaseous bodies.\nOrdinary lighting gas possesses an elevating force of about 700 grams\nfor every cubic meter. But hydrogen possesses an ascensional force\nestimated at 1,100 grams per cubic meter. Pure hydrogen prepared\naccording to the method of the celebrated Henry Gifford filled the\nenormous balloon. And as the capacity of the \"Go-Ahead\" was 40,000\ncubic meters, the ascensional power of the gas she contained was\n40,000 multiplied by 1,100 or 44,000 kilograms.\n\nOn this 29th of April everything was ready. Since eleven o'clock the\nenormous aerostat had been floating a few feet from the ground ready\nto rise in mid-air. It was splendid weather and seemed to have been\nmade specially for the experiment, although if the breeze had been\nstronger the results might have been more conclusive. There had never\nbeen any doubt that a balloon could be guided in a calm atmosphere;\nbut to guide it when the atmosphere is in motion is quite another\nthing; and it is under such circumstances that the experiment should\nbe tried.\n\nBut there was no wind today, nor any sign of any. Strange to say,\nNorth America on that day omitted to send on to Europe one of those\nfirst-class storms which it seems to have in such inexhaustible\nnumbers. A better day could not have been chosen for an aeronautic\nexperiment.\n\nThe crowd was immense in Fairmount Park; trains had poured into the\nPennsylvania capital sightseers from the neighboring states;\nindustrial and commercial life came to a standstill that the people\nmight troop to the show-master, workmen, women, old men, children,\nmembers of Congress, soldiers, magistrates, reporters, white natives\nand black natives, all were there. We need not stop to describe the\nexcitement, the unaccountable movements, the sudden pushings, which\nmade the mass heave and swell. Nor need we recount the number of\ncheers which rose from all sides like fireworks when Uncle Prudent\nand Phil Evans appeared on the platform and hoisted the American\ncolors. Need we say that the majority of the crowd had come from afar\nnot so much to see the \"Go-Ahead\" as to gaze on these extraordinary\nmen?\n\nWhy two and not three? Why not Frycollin? Because Frycollin thought\nhis campaign in the \"Albatross\" sufficient for his fame. He had\ndeclined the honor of accompanying his master, and he took no part in\nthe frenzied declamations that greeted the president and secretary of\nthe Weldon Institute.\n\nOf the members of the illustrious assembly not one was absent from\nthe reserved places within the ropes. There were Truck Milnor, Bat T.\nFynn, and William T. Forbes with his two daughters on his arm. All\nhad come to affirm by their presence that nothing could separate them\nfrom the partisans of \"lighter than air.\"\n\nAbout twenty minutes past eleven a gun announced the end of the final\npreparations. The \"Go-Ahead\" only waited the signal to start. At\ntwenty-five minutes past eleven the second gun was fired.\n\nThe \"Go-Ahead\" was about one hundred and fifty feet above the\nclearing, and was held by a rope. In this way the platform commanded\nthe excited crowd. Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans stood upright and\nplaced their left hands on their hearts, to signify how deeply they\nwere touched by their reception. Then they extended their right hands\ntowards the zenith, to signify that the greatest of known balloons\nwas about to take possession of the supra-terrestrial domain.\n\nA hundred thousand hands were placed in answer on a hundred thousand\nhearts, and a hundred thousand other hands were lifted to the sky.\n\nThe third gun was fired at half-past eleven. \"Let go!\" shouted Uncle\nPrudent; and the \"Go-Ahead\" rose \"majestically\"--an adverb\nconsecrated by custom to all aerostatic ascents.\n\nIt really was a superb spectacle. It seemed as if a vessel were just\nlaunched from the stocks. And was she not a vessel launched into the\naerial sea? The \"Go-Ahead\" went up in a perfectly vertical line--a\nproof of the calmness of the atmosphere--and stopped at an altitude\nof eight hundred feet.\n\nThen she began her horizontal maneuvering. With her screws going she\nmoved to the east at a speed of twelve yards a second. That is the\nspeed of the whale--not an inappropriate comparison, for the balloon\nwas somewhat of the shape of the giant of the northern seas.\n\nA salvo of cheers mounted towards the skillful aeronauts. Then under\nthe influence of her rudder, the \"Go-Ahead\" went through all the\nevolutions that her steersman could give her. She turned in a small\ncircle; she moved forwards and backwards in a way to convince the\nmost refractory disbeliever in the guiding of balloons. And if there\nhad been any disbeliever there he would have been simply annihilated.\n\nBut why was there no wind to assist at this magnificent experiment?\nIt was regrettable. Doubtless the spectators would have seen the\n\"Go-Ahead\" unhesitatingly execute all the movements of a\nsailing-vessel in beating to windward, or of a steamer driving in the\nwind's eye.\n\nAt this moment the aerostat rose a few hundred yards. The maneuver\nwas understood below. Uncle Prudent and his companions were going in\nsearch of a breeze in the higher zones, so as to complete the\nexperiment. The system of cellular balloons--analogous to the\nswimming bladder in fishes--into which could be introduced a certain\namount of air by pumping, had provided for this vertical motion.\nWithout throwing out ballast or losing gas the aeronaut was able to\nrise or sink at his will. Of course there was a valve in the upper\nhemisphere which would permit of a rapid descent if found necessary.\nAll these contrivances are well known, but they were here fitted in\nperfection.\n\nThe \"Go-Ahead\" then rose vertically. Her enormous dimensions\ngradually grew smaller to the eye, and the necks of the crowd were\nalmost cricked as they gazed into the air. Gradually the whale became\na porpoise, and the porpoise became a gudgeon. The ascensional\nmovement did not cease until the \"Go-Ahead\" had reached a height of\nfourteen thousand feet. But the air was so free from mist that she\nremained clearly visible.\n\nHowever, she remained over the clearing as if she were a fixture. An\nimmense bell had imprisoned the atmosphere and deprived it of\nmovement; not a breath of wind was there, high or low. The aerostat\nmaneuvered without encountering any resistance, seeming very small\nowing to the distance, much as if she were being looked at through\nthe wrong end of a telescope.\n\nSuddenly there was a shout among the crowd, a shout followed by a\nhundred thousand more. All hands were stretched towards a point on the\nhorizon. That point was the northwest. There in the deep azure\nappeared a moving body, which was approaching and growing larger. Was\nit a bird beating with its wings the higher zones of space? Was it an\naerolite shooting obliquely through the atmosphere? In any case, its\nspeed was terrific, and it would soon be above the crowd. A suspicion\ncommunicated itself electrically to the brains of all on the clearing.\n\nBut it seemed as though the \"Go-Ahead\" had sighted this strange\nobject. Assuredly it seemed as though she feared some danger, for her\nspeed was increased, and she was going east as fast as she could.\n\nYes, the crowd saw what it meant! A name uttered by one of the\nmembers of the Weldon Institute was repeated by a hundred thousand\nmouths:\n\n\"The \"Albatross!\" The \"Albatross!\"\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXIII\n\nTHE GRAND COLLAPSE\n\n\nIt was indeed the \"Albatross!\" It was indeed Robur who had reappeared\nin the heights of the sky! It was he who like a huge bird of prey was\ngoing to strike the \"Go-Ahead.\"\n\nAnd yet, nine months before, the aeronef, shattered by the explosion,\nher screws broken, her deck smashed in two, had been apparently\nannihilated.\n\nWithout the prodigious coolness of the engineer, who reversed the\ngyratory motion of the fore propeller and converted it into a\nsuspensory screw, the men of the \"Albatross\" would all have been\nasphyxiated by the fall. But if they had escaped asphyxia, how had\nthey escaped being drowned in the Pacific?\n\nThe remains of the deck, the blades of the propellers, the\ncompartments of the cabins, all formed a sort of raft. When a wounded\nbird falls on the waves its wings keep it afloat. For several hours\nRobur and his men remained unhelped, at first on the wreck, and\nafterwards in the india-rubber boat that had fallen uninjured. A few\nhours after sunrise they were sighted by a passing ship, and a boat\nwas lowered to their rescue.\n\nRobur and his companions were saved, and so was much of what remained\nof the aeronef. The engineer said that his ship had perished in a\ncollision, and no further questions were asked him.\n\nThe ship was an English three-master, the \"Two Friends,\" bound for\nMelbourne, where she arrived a few days afterwards.\n\nRobur was in Australia, but a long way from X Island, to which he\ndesired to return as soon as possible.\n\nIn the ruins of the aftermost cabin he had found a considerable sum\nof money, quite enough to provide for himself and companions without\napplying to anyone for help. A short time after he arrived in\nMelbourne he became the owner of a small brigantine of about a\nhundred tons, and in her he sailed for X Island.\n\nThere he had but one idea--to be avenged. But to secure his\nvengeance he would have to make another \"Albatross.\" This after all\nwas an easy task for him who made the first. He used up what he could\nof the old material; the propellers and engines he had brought back\nin the brigantine. The mechanism was fitted with new piles and new\naccumulators, and, in short, in less than eight months, the work was\nfinished, and a new \"Albatross,\" identical with the one destroyed by\nthe explosion, was ready to take flight. And he had the same crew.\n\nThe \"Albatross\" left X Island in the first week of April. During this\naerial passage Robur did not want to be seen from the earth, and he\ncame along almost always above the clouds. When he arrived over North\nAmerica he descended in a desolate spot in the Far West. There the\nengineer, keeping a profound incognito, learnt with considerable\npleasure that the Weldon Institute was about to begin its\nexperiments, and that the \"Go-Ahead,\" with Uncle Prudent and Phil\nEvans, was going to start from Philadelphia on the 29th of April.\n\nHere was a chance for Robur and his crew to gratify their longing for\nrevenge. Here was a chance for inflicting on their foes a terrible\nvengeance, which in the \"Go-Ahead\" they could not escape. A public\nvengeance, which would at the same time prove the superiority of the\naeronef to all aerostats and contrivances of that nature!\n\nAnd that is why, on this very day, like a vulture from the clouds,\nthe aeronef appeared over Fairmount Park.\n\nYes! It was the \"Albatross,\" easily recognizable by all those who had\nnever before seen her.\n\nThe \"Go-Ahead\" was in full flight; but it soon appeared that she\ncould not escape horizontally, and so she sought her safety in a\nvertical direction, not dropping to the ground, for the aeronef would\nhave cut her off, but rising to a zone where she could not perhaps be\nreached. This was very daring, and at the same time very logical.\n\nBut the \"Albatross\" began to rise after her. Although she was smaller\nthan the \"Go-Ahead,\" it was a case of the swordfish and the whale.\n\nThis could easily be seen from below and with what anxiety! In a few\nmoments the aerostat had attained a height of sixteen thousand feet.\n\nThe \"Albatross\" followed her as she rose. She flew round her flanks,\nand maneuvered round her in a circle with a constantly diminishing\nradius. She could have annihilated her at a stroke, and Uncle Prudent\nand his companions would have been dashed to atoms in a frightful\nfall.\n\nThe people, mute with horror, gazed breathlessly; they were seized\nwith that sort of fear which presses on the chest and grips the legs\nwhen we see anyone fall from a height. An aerial combat was beginning\nin which there were none of the chances of safety as in a sea-fight.\nIt was the first of its kind, but it would not be the last, for\nprogress is one of the laws of this world. And if the \"Go-Ahead\" was\nflying the American colors, did not the \"Albatross\" display the stars\nand golden sun of Robur the Conqueror?\n\nThe \"Go-Ahead\" tried to distance her enemy by rising still higher.\nShe threw away the ballast she had in reserve; she made a new leap of\nthree thousand feet; she was now but a dot in space. The \"Albatross,\"\nwhich followed her round and round at top speed, was now invisible.\n\nSuddenly a shout of terror rose from the crowd. The \"Go-Ahead\"\nincreased rapidly in size, and the aeronef appeared dropping with\nher. This time it was a fall. The gas had dilated in the higher zones\nof the atmosphere and had burst the balloon, which, half inflated\nstill, was falling rapidly.\n\nBut the aeronef, slowing her suspensory screws, came down just as\nfast. She ran alongside the \"Go-Ahead\" when she was not more than\nfour thousand feet from the ground.\n\nWould Robur destroy her?\n\nNo; he was going to save her crew!\n\nAnd so cleverly did he handle his vessel that the aeronaut jumped on\nboard.\n\nWould Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans refuse to be saved by him? They\nwere quite capable of doing so. But the crew threw themselves on them\nand dragged them by force from the \"Go-Ahead\" to the \"Albatross.\"\n\nThen the aeronef glided off and remained stationary, while the\nballoon, quite empty of gas, fell on the trees of the clearing and\nhung there like a gigantic rag.\n\nAn appalling silence reigned on the ground. It seemed as though life\nwere suspended in each of the crowd; and many eyes had been closed so\nas not to behold the final catastrophe. Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans\nhad again become the prisoners of the redoubtable Robur. Now he had\nrecaptured them, would he carry them off into space, where it was\nimpossible to follow him?\n\nIt seemed so.\n\nHowever, instead of mounting into the sky the \"Albatross\" stopped six\nfeet from the ground. Then, amid profound silence, the engineer's\nvoice was heard.\n\n\"Citizens of the United States,\" he said, \"The president and\nsecretary of the Weldon Institute are again in my power. In keeping\nthem I am only within my right. But from the passion kindled in them\nby the success of the \"Albatross\" I see that their minds are not\nprepared for that important revolution which the conquest of the air\nwill one day bring, Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans, you are free!\"\n\nThe president, the secretary, and the aeronaut had only to jump down.\n\nThen Robur continued.\n\n\"Citizens of the United States, my experiment is finished; but my\nadvice to those present is to be premature in nothing, not even in\nprogress. It is evolution and not revolution that we should seek. In\na word, we must not be before our time. I have come too soon today to\nwithstand such contradictory and divided interests as yours.

They went home.\n\nAnd the crowd by a sudden change of front greeted them with\nparticularly keen sarcasms, and, at their expense, are sarcastic\nstill.\n\nAnd now, who is this Robur?

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":257,"split":"train"}
