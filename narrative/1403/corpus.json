The work is noted for its vigor of description. With a background of ocean waves, it is a story of married life.\nSalve Kristiansen loves a beautiful woman named Elisabeth and is evidently loved in return. But for a time Elisabeth is attracted to a young officer who wishes to marry her. The old love for Salve prevails, however, and Elisabeth spurns the officer, but Salve has already left his native land in desperation and is sailing toward foreign shores. When he finally, after some years, returns to his old home, he finds that Elisabeth, after all, has been true to him. He marries her.\nIt would seem that all is well, but such is not the case. The thought of Elisabeth's momentary hesitation does not leave Salve, and this unfortunate circumstance makes life miserable for both. Ten years elapse before the husband and wife finally come to a clear understanding and a genuine appreciation of one another, and now at last are enabled to lay the foundation for a happy life together. The novel emphasizes the need of implicit confidence and trust, if two persons united in wedlock are to live happily together.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Pilot and his Wife, by Jonas Lie\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

It is a wild and lonely\nsituation,--the spray, in stormy weather, driving in sheets against the\nwalls, and eagles and sea-birds not unfrequently dashing themselves to\ndeath against the thick glass panes at night; while in winter all\ncommunication with the land is very often cut off, either by drift or\npatchy ice, which is impassable either on foot or by boat.\n\nThese, however, and others of the now numerous lights along that\ndangerous coast, are of comparatively recent erection. Many persons now\nliving can remember the time when for long reaches the only lighting was\nthe gleam of the white breakers themselves. And the captain who had\npassed the Ox\u00c3\u00b6 light off Christiansand might think himself lucky if he\nsighted the distant Jomfruland up by Krager\u00c3\u00b6.\n\nAbout a score of years before the lighthouse was placed on Little\nTorungen there was, however, already a house there, if it could be\ndignified by that name, with its back and one side almost up to the eave\nof the roof stuck into a heap of stones, so that it had the appearance\nof bending forward to let the storm sweep over it. The low entrance-door\nopened to the land, and two small windows looked out upon the sea, and\nupon the boat, which was usually drawn up in a cleft above the sea-weed\noutside.\n\nWhen you entered, or, more properly speaking, descended into it, there\nwas more room than might have been expected; and it contained sundry\narticles of furniture, such as a handsome press and sideboard, which no\none would have dreamt of finding under such a roof. In one corner there\nstood an old spinning-wheel covered with dust, and with a smoke-blackened\ntuft of wool still hanging from its reel; from which, and from other\nsmall indications, it might be surmised that there had once been a woman\nin the house, and that tuft of wool had probably been her last spin.\n\nThere sat now on the bench by the hearth a lonely old man, of a\nflint-hard and somewhat gloomy countenance, with a mass of white hair\nfalling over his ears and neck, who was generally occupied with some\ncobbling work, and who from time to time, as he drew out the thread,\nwould make some remark aloud, as if he thought he still had the partner\nof his life for audience. The look askance over his brass spectacles\nwith which he greeted any casual stranger who might come into the house\nhad very little welcome in it, and an expression about his sunken mouth\nand sharp chin said plainly enough that the other might state his\nbusiness at once and be gone. He sought no company; and the only time he\nhad ever been seen at church was when he came rowing over to Trom\u00c3\u00b6 with\nhis wife's body in her coffin. When the pastor sprinkled earth upon it,\nit was observed that the tears streamed down his cheeks, and it was long\nafter dark before he quitted the churchyard to return. He had become a\nproverb for obstinacy for miles beyond his own residence; and people who\ndealt with him for fish in the harbour, if they once began to bargain,\nwere as likely as not to see him without a word just quietly row away.\n\nAll that was known further about \"Old Jacob,\" as he was called, was that\nhe had once been a pilot, and that he had had a son who had taken to\ndrinking, through whose fault it had been eventually that the father had\nlost his certificate; and it was thought that on the occasion in\nquestion the father had taken the son's blame upon himself. Since then\nhe had shunned society, and had retired with his wife to his present\nhabitation, whither, after their son was drowned, they had brought their\nlittle orphan granddaughter, who now was his sole companion. His only\nostensible means of living were by shoemaking, and by fishing, the\nproduce of which he generally disposed of to passing ships, and, during\nthe earlier period of his sojourn there, by shooting occasionally. But\nit was understood that he received a small regular contribution from\nseveral of the pilots, certificated or otherwise, of the district, for\nkeeping a fire alight on his hearth during the dark autumn nights, and\nso giving them, by the light from his two windows, something to steer by\nwhen they arrived off the coast after nightfall. Whether the light was\nshown for their benefit particularly, or whether it was not rather\nintended for the guidance of smuggling vessels standing in under cover\nof the night to land their cargoes, it was not their business to\ninquire. Its friendly assistance was, at all events, not unacknowledged\nby these latter, and very acceptable presents, in the shape of kegs of\nspirits, bags of coffee, tobacco, meal, and so forth, would, from time\nto time, come rolling into the old man's room, so that upon the whole,\nhe was well-to-do enough out there upon his rock.\n\nOf late years he had fallen into feeble health, and found it not so easy\nto row the long distance over to land. Even in his best days he had,\nowing to an old injury to one of his legs, found some difficulty in\ngetting down to the boat; and now, therefore, he sat during the greater\npart of the day over the hearth, in his woolen jacket and leather\nbreeches, with his indoor work. Now and then, when his granddaughter--a\nchild with a thick crop of hair falling about her ears, and a rough dog\nconstantly at her heels--would burst into the house with all the\nfreshness of the outside air blowing round her, as it were, and deliver\nherself of her intelligence, he might be drawn, perhaps, to the window\nto look out over the sea, and afterwards, like a growling bear disturbed\nfrom its lair, even follow her with some difficulty out of the door with\nthe spyglass. There he would station himself, so as to use her shoulder\nas a rest for his shaking hand, and with his never-ceasing directions\nand growling going on behind her neck, she would do her best to fix the\nglass on the desired object. His crossness would then disappear, little\nby little, in their joint speculation as to what ship it could be, or in\nwhatever remarks it might suggest; and after giving his decision, the\nold man would generally hobble in again.\n\nHe was really very proud of his granddaughter's cleverness. She could\ndistinguish with her naked eye as clearly as he could through the glass.\nShe never made a mistake about the craft, large or small, that belonged\nto that part of the coast, and could, besides, say to a nicety, what\nsort of master each had. Her superiority of sight she asserted, too,\nwith a tyranny to which he made no resistance, although it might have\ntried a temper many degrees more patient than his was.\n\nOne day, however, she was at a loss. They made out a crescent on the\nflag, and this caused even the old man a moment's astonishment. But he\ndeclared then, for her information, shortly and decisively, that it was\na \"barbarian.\"\n\nThis satisfied her for a moment. But then she asked--\n\n\"What is a barbarian, grandfather?\"\n\n\"It is a Turk.\"\n\n\"Yes, but a Turk?\"\n\n\"Oh! it's--it's--a Mohammedan--\"\n\n\"A what!--a Moham--\"\n\n\"A Mohammedan--a robber on board ship.\"\n\n\"On board ship!\"\n\nHe was not going to give up his ascendancy in the matter, hard as she\npushed him; so he bethought him of a pack of old tales there-anent, and\nwent on to explain drily--\n\n\"They go to the Baltic--to Russia--to salt human flesh.\"\n\n\"Human flesh!\"\n\n\"Yes, and sometimes, too, they seize vessels in the open sea and do\ntheir salting there.\"\n\nShe fixed a pair of large, terrified eyes on him, which made the old man\ncontinue--\n\n\"And it is especially for little girls they look. That meat is the\nfinest, and goes by tons down to the Grand Turk.\"\n\nHaving played this last trump, he was going in again, but was stopped by\nher eager question--\n\n\"Do they use a glass there on board?\" And when he said they did, she\nslipped quickly by him through the door, and kept cautiously within as\nlong as the vessel was to be seen through the window-pane on the\nhorizon.\n\nThe moods of the two were for once reversed. The old man looked very sly\nover his work, whilst she was quiet and cowed. Once only she broke out\nangrily--\n\n\"But why doesn't the king get rid of them? If I was captain of a\nman-of-war, I'd--\"\n\n\"Yes, Elizabeth, if you were captain of a man-of-war!--what then?\"\n\nThe child's conceptions apparently reached no further than such matters\nas these as yet. She had seen few human beings as she grew up, and in\nrecent years, after her grandmother's death, she and her grandfather had\nbeen the only regular inhabitants of the island. Every now and then\nthere might perhaps come a boat on one errand or another, and a couple\nof times she had paid a visit to her maternal aunt on land, at Arendal.\nHer grandfather had taught her to read and write, and with what she\nfound in the Bible and psalm-book, and in 'Exploits of Danish and\nNorwegian Naval Heroes,' a book in their possession, she had in a manner\nlived pretty much upon the anecdotes which in leisure moments she could\nextract from that grandfather, so chary of his speech, about his sailor\nlife in his youth.\n\nThey had besides, in the little inner room, a small print, without a\nframe, of the action near the Heather Islands, in which he had taken\npart. It represented the frigate Naiad, with the brigs Samso, Kiel, and\nLolland, in furious conflict with the English ship of the line Dictator,\nwhich lay across the narrow harbour with the brig Calypso, and was\npounding the Naiad to pieces. The names of the ships were printed\nunderneath.\n\nOn the print there was little to be seen but mast-heads and\ncannon-mouths, and a confusion of smoke, but in this had the child lived\nwhole years of her life; and many a time in fancy had she stood there\nand fought the Englishman. Men-of-war and their officers had become the\nhighest conception of her fancy, and the dearest wish of her heart was\nthat a man-of-war might some day pass so near to Torungen that she would\nbe able to see distinctly everything on board.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nAfter old Jacob had fallen into ill health, lighterman Kristiansen used\nto come out oftener to Torungen with provisions and other necessaries;\nand his visits now became periodical.\n\nHe was accompanied one autumn by his son Salv\u00c3\u00a9, a black-haired,\ndark-eyed, handsome lad, with a sharp, clever face, who had worked in\nthe fishing-boats along the coast from his childhood almost, and had, in\nfact, been brought up amongst its sunken rocks and reefs and breakers.\nHe was something small in stature, perhaps; but what he wanted in\nrobustness he made up in readiness and activity--qualities which stood\nhim in good stead in the many quarrels into which his too ready tongue\nwas wont to bring him. He was eighteen years old at this time; had been\nalready engaged as an able seaman; and was in great request at the\nSandvigen and Vraangen dances,--a fact of which he was perfectly well\naware. Old Jacob's granddaughter, being a little girl of only fourteen\nyears of age, was of course altogether beneath his notice, and he didn't\ncondescend to speak to her. He merely delivered himself of the witticism\nthat she was like a heron; and with her thick, checked woollen\nhandkerchief tied with the ends behind her waist, the resemblance was\nnot so very far-fetched. At any rate, he declared on the way home that\nsuch a specimen of womankind he, for his part, had never come across\nbefore, and that he would give anything to see her dancing in the public\nroom with her thin arms and legs--it would be like a grasshopper.\n\nThe next time he came, she took out her grandfather's watch in its\nsilver case and showed it to him, and some conversation passed between\nthem. His first impression of her was that she was stupid. She asked\nquestions about every sort of thing, and seemed to think that he must\nknow everything. And finally, she wanted to know what it was like on\nshore among the great folk of Arendal, and particularly how the ladies\nbehaved. It afforded him much amusement at the time to see with what\nsimple credulity she took in everything he chose to invent on the\nsubject; but after he had left he was not sure that he wasn't sorry for\nwhat he had done, and at the same time he made the discovery that the\ngirl, in her way, was anything but silly.\n\nHis remorse was to be brought home to him presently, for old Jacob had\nhad duly recounted to him over again all his cock-and-bull stories, and\nwas in high dudgeon. When he came again the old man was very snappish to\nhim, and he found it so unpleasant in the house that he made all the\nhaste he could to get his business done. While he was thus occupied, the\nlittle girl told him all about the Naiad, and the part her grandfather\nhad taken in the action. Salv\u00c3\u00a9, who was ruffled, and thought the old man\nhad been an ill-mannered old dog, followed the relation from time to\ntime with a sneering remark, which in her eagerness she didn't notice,\nor didn't understand. But when he had finished what he had to do, he\ngave vent to his feelings in a way she did understand,--he laughed\nincredulously.\n\n\"Old Jacob there on board the Naiad! This is the first time anybody ever\nheard of it.\"\n\nThe individual in question unfortunately came out at the moment to see\nthe boat off, and turning, to him, red with anger, she cried--\n\n\"Grandfather! he doesn't believe you were on board the Naiad that time!\"\n\nThe old man answered at first as if he didn't deign to enter upon any\ncontroversy on the subject--\n\n\"Oh, I suppose it's only little girls' prattle again.\"\n\nBut whether it was wounded vanity, or a sudden access of irritation\nagainst the lad, or that his eye fell upon his granddaughter standing\nthere, so evidently incensed and resentful, he flared up the next\nmoment, and thrusting his huge fist under the youngster's nose, burst\nout--\n\n\"If you want to know all about it, you young swabber, I may tell you I\nstood on the Naiad's gun-deck with better folk than _you_ are ever\nlikely to come across\"--he stamped his foot here as if he had the deck\nunder him--\"when, with one broadside from the Dictator, the three masts\nand bowsprit were shot away, and the main deck came crashing down upon\nthe lower;\"--the last sentence was taken from 'Exploits of Danish and\nNorwegian Naval Heroes,' and the old man was as proud of these lines as\nhe would have been of a medal.\n\n\"When the crash came,\" he pursued, always in the same posture, and in\nthe manner of the sacred text, \"he who stands here and tells the tale\nhad but just time to save himself by leaping into the sea through a\ngun-port.\"\n\nBut he threw off then the trammels of the text, and continued _in\npropri\u00c3\u00a2 person\u00c3\u00a2_, violently gesticulating with his fists, and steadily\nadvancing all the time, while Salv\u00c3\u00a9 prudently retreated before his\nadvance down to the boat.\n\n\"We don't deal in lies and fabricate stories out here like you, you\nyoung whipper-snapper of a ship's cub; and if it wasn't for your father,\nwho has sense enough to rope's-end you himself, I'd lay a stick across\nyour back till you hadn't a howl left in you.\"\n\nWith this finale of the longest speech to which he had given vent for\nthirty years perhaps, he turned with a short nod to the father, and went\ninto the house again.\n\nElizabeth was miserable that Salv\u00c3\u00a9 should go away like this, without so\nmuch as deigning to say good-bye to her. And her grandfather was cross\nenough himself; for he was afraid that he had done something foolish,\nand broken with the lighterman.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 came out to the rock again the next autumn, after a voyage to\nLiverpool and Havre.\n\nAt first he was rather shy, although his father and old Jacob Torungen\nhad in the interval, in spite of that little affair of the previous\nyear, been on the best of terms. The white bear, however, as he called\nhim, seemed to have altogether forgotten what had passed; and with the\ngirl he was very easily reconciled--she had learnt now not to tell\neverything to her grandfather.\n\nWhilst the lighterman and old Jacob enjoyed a heart-warming glass\ntogether in the house, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 carried the things up to the cellar,\nElizabeth following him up and down every time, and the conversation\nmeanwhile going round all the points of the compass, so to speak. After\nshe had asked him about Havre de Grace, where he had been, and about\nAmerica, where he had not been,--if his captain's wife was as fine as a\nman-of-war captain's; and then if he wouldn't like one day to marry a\nfine lady,--she wanted at last to know, from the laughing sailor lad, if\nthe officers' wives were ever allowed to be with them in war.\n\nHer face had of late acquired something wonderfully attractive in its\nexpression--such a seriousness would come over it sometimes, although\nshe continued as childlike as ever; and such eyes as hers were, at all\nevents in Salv\u00c3\u00a9's experience, not common. At any rate, after this, he\ninvariably accompanied his father upon these expeditions.\n\nThe last time he was out there he told her about the dances on shore at\nSandvigen, and took care to give her to understand that the girls made\nmuch of him there--but he was tired now of dancing with them.\n\nShe was very curious on this subject, and extracted from him that he had\nhad two tremendous fights that winter. She looked at him in terror, and\nasked rather hesitatingly--\n\n\"But had they done anything to you?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! all dancing entertainments have a little extra dance like that\nto wind up with. They merely wanted to dance with the girl I had asked\nfirst.\"\n\n\"Is it so dangerous, then? What sort of a girl was she?--I mean, what\nwas her name?\"\n\n\"Oh, one was called Marie, and the other was Anne--Herluf Andersen's\ndaughter. They were pretty girls, I can tell you. Anne had a white\nbrooch and earrings, and danced more smoothly than ever you saw a cutter\nsail. Mate George said the same.\"\n\nThe upshot of this conversation was, that she found out that the girls\nin Arendal, and in the ports generally where he had touched, were all\nwell dressed; and the next time he returned from Holland, he promised he\nwould bring with him a pair of morocco-leather shoes with silver buckles\nfor her.\n\nWith this promise they parted, after she had allowed him--and that there\nmight be no mistake, twice over--to take the accurate measure of her\nfoot; and there were roses of joy in her cheeks, as she called after him\nto be sure and not forget them.\n\nThe year after Salv\u00c3\u00a9 came with the shoes. There were silver buckles in\nthem, and they were very smart; but if they were, they had cost him more\nthan half a month's pay.\n\nElizabeth was more carefully dressed now, and might almost be called\ngrown up. She hesitated about accepting the shoes, and didn't ask\nquestions about everything as she used to do. Nor was she so willing to\nstand and talk with him alone by the boat--she liked to have him up\nwithin hearing of the others.\n\n\"Don't you see how high the sea is running?\" he said, and tried to\npersuade her that the boat would be dashed to pieces on the rocks. But\nshe saw that it wasn't true, and went up with a little toss of her head\nalone. He followed her.\n\nShe must have learned all this in Arendal, where in the course of the\nautumn she had been confirmed, and where she had lived with her aunt.\nBut she had grown marvellously handsome in that time--so much so,\nindeed, that Salv\u00c3\u00a9 was almost taken aback when he saw her; and when they\nsaid good-bye, it was no longer in the old laughing tones, but with some\nslight embarrassment on his side--he didn't seem to know exactly how\nmatters lay between them.\n\nAfter that she filled his head so completely that he had not a thought\nfor anything else.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nThe old Juno, to which Salv\u00c3\u00a9 belonged, was lying at that time at\nSandvigen, and was only waiting for a north-east wind to come out. She\nwas a square-rigged vessel, with a crew of nineteen hands all told,\nwhich had plied for many years in American waters, and off and on in the\nNorth Sea, and was reckoned at the time one of Arendal's largest craft.\nHer arrival or departure was quite an event for the town and\nneighbourhood; and to have a berth in her was considered among the\nsailors of the district a very high honour indeed--the more so that her\nmaster and principal owner, Captain Beck, was a particularly good chief\nto serve under, and a lucky one to boot.\n\nWhen at last, between ten and eleven o'clock one morning, she weighed\nanchor, and before a light north-westerly breeze, with her small sails\nset, glided out to sea, the quays were crowded with spectators, the\nmajority of the crew belonging to the place, and it being generally\nknown that they were bound on a longer voyage than usual. On board she\nhad with her still the captain's son, Carl Beck, a smart young naval\nofficer, with his sister and a small party of their friends, who meant\nto land out on the Torungens in the sailing-boat they had in tow. They\nwished to remain with her as long as possible, and for the purpose had\nmade up a party to the islands, where the gentlemen proposed to shoot\nsome of the sea-fowl, which are to be found out there on the rocks in\nswarms at the spring season of the year on their passage north along the\ncoast.\n\nIt was about four o'clock when they passed Little Torungen; and as there\nwere swells then bursting in white jets upon the reefs, and a line of\ndark fire-fringed clouds about the sunset, which looked like heavy\nweather coming up, the pleasure party determined to leave the vessel\nhere, instead of going on, as they had intended, to the larger of the\ntwo islands.\n\nAs they went over the side Salv\u00c3\u00a9 Kristiansen was standing out on the\nforecastle gazing eagerly over to where the barren mass of rock lay like\na dipping hull in the distance, bathed in the evening sun, and with a\nfringe of foam round its base; and he could see old Jacob's\ngranddaughter standing by the wall of the house with the glass. He had\nchosen on purpose a conspicuous place, and stood with his back against\nthe stay, so heavy of heart and sad at having to go away, that it would\nhave taken very little to make him burst into tears. It seemed to have\ndawned upon him all of a sudden that he was in love.\n\nTo try whether it was upon him that she was directing the glass, or at\nthe unusual discharging of freight into the sail-boat, he waved his hat,\nand his whole face lighted up with joy as he saw her return his signal.\nHe took off his hat again, and received another wave of the glass in\nreply.\n\nHe stood there then straining his eyes abstractedly in the direction of\nthe rock until it disappeared behind them in the gathering twilight. He\nhad been inspirited for the whole voyage; and the first thing he should\ndo when they arrived at Boston would be to buy a dress and a ring; and\nwhen he came home he determined that his first business should be to\nmake an expedition to the island, and put a certain question to a\ncertain person whom he knew out there.\n\nHe was roused from his abstraction by the boatswain bawling out his\nname, and asking if he was going to sleep there, and whether he wanted\nsomething to wake him up. The order had been given to make all snug for\nthe night, as the breeze was freshening.\n\nThe watches had been set at noon, and the starboard and larboard watch\ntold off, as customary on the first day a vessel goes to sea. Salv\u00c3\u00a9 had\nthe middle watch; and by that time the sea was running high, and they\nwere plunging through the darkness under a double-reefed mainsail, the\nmoon every now and then clearing an open space in the storm--clouds that\nwere driving like smoke before it, so that he could fitfully distinguish\nobjects over the deck, even to the look-out man's looming figure out\nupon the forecastle.\n\nUpon the capstan bar sat a sailor in oilskin clothes, who had probably\nbeen on shore the previous night and not closed his eyes, and who was\nmaking great efforts to keep awake. His head, however, would still keep\nnodding; and from time to time he stood up and tried to keep himself\nwarm by exercising his arms. He sang, or more often took up afresh upon\neach recovery of consciousness a verse of a half-Swedish ballad about a\n\"girl so true,\" that he wished he then had by his side, for the time\nwithout her seemed so long. Now and then the spray of a sea would bring\nhim more sharply to himself, but it did not last long; and so the ditty,\nwhich was melancholy to the last degree, would begin afresh.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 was far too restless to have any desire to sleep, and as he paced\nto and fro by the fore-hatch, lost in his dreams, and listened to the\nsong, it seemed to him a most touching one.\n\nThe nodding sailor little thought that he was performing before a\ndeeply-moved audience.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nThe party, meanwhile, that had left the ship, were passing the night\nwith old Jacob on Torungen. They had tried first to beat out to the\nlarger island, but the sea had risen, darkness had set in, and it had\nsoon become evident that it was no longer pleasure-sailing for a boat\nwith ladies in it. They had determined, therefore, rather than go about\nfor home, and lose the whole sporting expedition, which was to have\nlasted for two or three days, to spend the night on Little Torungen and\nsee what the morning would do for them.\n\nGreat was old Jacob's astonishment, it may readily be supposed, when\nthere came in the late evening a knocking at the door, and he saw by the\nlight from the hearth no less than six grand folk come streaming in,\nwith two ladies amongst them. He shaded his eyes with his hand, and\nlooked at them in mute amazement.\n\nAs for Elizabeth, if it had been a train of fairies that had suddenly\nappeared, they could not have occasioned her more terror and curiosity.\nIt was getting near bedtime, and she had been sitting half-asleep over\nthe fire, and perhaps her suddenly awakened excitement lent a more than\nusual animation and attraction to a pair of eyes and a face that would\nnowhere have passed unnoticed; for Carl Beck, who was at the head of the\nparty, seemed positively fascinated, and could not take his eyes off\nher, until, reddening with confusion, she instinctively stretched out\nher hand for her bodice, that lay beside her on the bench.\n\n\"Good evening, Jacob, old boy,\" cried Carl, in the frank, off-hand\nmanner that became him so well, going up to the old fellow, and laying\nhis hand cordially on his shoulder. \"I'm afraid we shall be very\ntroublesome to you, such a large party; but we want you to let us stay\nhere till morning, till we see if the weather moderates a bit. We\ndaren't go driving out in the dark to Great Torungen, on account of\nthese women folk that we have on board,\"--and he pointed, jokingly, to\nhis sister and her friend.\n\n\"I see you have to deal with womankind too, so you know what it is.\"\n\nThe old man was apparently not insensible to this genial way of dealing\nwith him. He rose from his seat and made room at the fire, begging that\nthey would put up with what accommodation he had to offer, and telling\nElizabeth at the same time to go out for more wood.\n\nWhile the party gathered round the fire, and made themselves as\ncomfortable as they could, Carl Beck was outside with the boatmen,\nseeing about having the provisions brought up. He came in again with\nElizabeth, also with an armful of wood. Throwing it down, laughing, he\ncried--\n\n\"Now for a 'bowl,' as our friends the Swedes have it. But first, out\nwith the food.\"\n\nThere was no scarcity of eatables, which were discussed amid a running\nfire of conversation upon every kind of topic; and then came the \"bowl,\"\na composition of various strong and spicy ingredients, of which Carl had\nthe secret, and which finally was lighted, and ladled into the glasses\nwhilst the blue flame was burning.\n\nCarl Beck was the life of the party; and very well he looked as he sat\nthere astride over the bench, with his glass in his hand, and his\nofficer's jacket with its anchor-buttons thrown open, and sang first one\nand then another of the rollicking drinking-songs that were then in\nvogue, the others joining in the chorus. He gave them, then, a cheery\nsailor-song, which brought in its train a series of anecdotes from the\nrecent war.\n\nOld Jacob, under the influence of the prevailing good-fellowship and the\ngood cheer, had become uncommonly lively for him, and would even put in\na word now and then. But every attempt to make him tell a story himself\nfailed. Only when the action at the Heather Islands came up for\ndiscussion for a while did he come out with a bit of a yarn, as he\ncalled it.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, putting carefully down the glass that was handed to him,\n\"it was a great battle, was that. The country lost a fine ship there,\nand many a brave lad to boot. But God's curse hangs over the man that\npiloted the Englishman in to the Sand Islands--although none here, while\nhe was alive, knew his name. It was said he soon after made an end of\nhimself through remorse, like Judas Iscariot. However that may be, at\nthe mouth of the channel there is a flat sunk rock that a man in his\nsea-boots can stand on at low water, and there they see him on moonlight\nnights making piteous signs for help, until the water at last comes over\nhis head, and he disappears. God help the man that'll row out to\nhim--it's always foul weather when he is to be seen.\"\n\n\"Have you ever seen him yourself, Jacob?\" asked Carl Beck.\n\n\"I'll not say that I have, and I'll not say that I haven't. But I know\nthat the last time I was off those islands, we had such tremendous\nweather that we thought ourselves lucky in making any port at all.\"\n\nFor a while every one was busied with the thoughts which Jacob's recital\nhad suggested, and there was a solemn pause, which was broken by Carl\nBeck's striking up another song to keep off sleep:--\n\n       \"Before the wind and a flowing sail,\n         Vessels for every port!\n       In letters of gold a dear girl's name\n         On every stern inwrought!\n       The vessel may sail the world around,\n       But with her the girls will still be found!\n     Hurrah! then, boys, for the one of your mind,\n     That never, oh, never, you'll leave behind.\"\n\nHe repeated the last couplet with a gay inclination of his glass to the\nladies, who were sitting now tired and huddled together on the bench,\nand over their heads to Elizabeth, who was standing in the background,\nawake enough for both of them. The light from the fire fell upon his\nhandsome brown face, with the raven black curly hair, and the dark eyes\nthat it was said he had inherited from his recently deceased mother, who\nwas from Brest; and with his flow of animal spirits, that sufficed for\nthe whole party almost, he certainly was as manly and handsome a lad as\nyou would wish to meet.\n\nThe wind by this time had gone down considerably; and, as day was\nbreaking, the whole party were in the boat once more and enjoying a\nquiet sleep as they sailed. It was long, though, before Elizabeth could\nget out of her thoughts the handsome young officer who had sat there by\nthe fire. And many a time would she conjure up his form on the bench\nagain--particularly as he looked when he held up his glass and glanced\nover to her while he sang--\n\n     \"Hurrah! then, boys, for the one of your mind,\n     That never, oh, never, you'll leave behind.\"\n\nSubsequently to this, Carl Beck made repeated excursions out to Torungen\nto shoot sea-birds, and, by preference, alone in his sailing-boat. But,\nwhether it was an instinct or not on her side, it happened somehow that\nhe never had any further conversation with her without the old man being\nwith them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nThe Juno arrived in due course at Boston, where Salv\u00c3\u00a9 invested a\nconsiderable portion of his wages in the material for a dress, a couple\nof silk handkerchiefs, and two massive rings with his own and\nElizabeth's initials on them.\n\nFrom Boston she proceeded to Grimsby with a Canadian cargo; then on a\nshort trip to Liverpool; then back to Quebec; and some ten or eleven\nmonths after leaving Arendal, they were on a voyage from Memel in the\nBaltic to New York, with a cargo of timber, planks, and pipe-staves--the\nintention being to call in at the home port, for which she had some\ngeneral cargo, to take in provisions.\n\nDuring these voyages Salv\u00c3\u00a9, as one may say, had completed his\napprenticeship to the sea; and in his blue shirt loosely knotted round\nthe throat, his leather belt and canvas trousers, he had such a look of\nsmartness and energy that it required no very great amount of\ndiscernment to perceive in him a sailor from top to toe. He had, sooner\nthan most, risen superior to the dangers and temptations to which young\nsailor lads are exposed during the years of their novitiate, and with a\nbreak-neck recklessness of disposition he combined such a perfectly\ncat-like activity, that his superior smartness was recognised even among\nhis comrades. His bearing, it is true, was rather arrogant, and his\ntongue not the most good-natured; but he was generally liked\nnevertheless, for he was kind-hearted, if he was only taken on the right\nside, and it did not seem to be his sailor-like qualities upon which he\nprided himself so much as upon the superior acuteness of his\nunderstanding, which he delighted to display in discussions with the\nred-bearded and somewhat consequential sailmaker, who had the reputation\nof being a well-read man, and who affected a proportionate importance.\n\nUp at Memel they had had great difficulties to contend with, owing to\nthe condition of the ice; and their bad luck seemed to be going to\nfollow them, for in the Skager Rack they found themselves suddenly\nwedged into a field of drift-ice, with the prospect of having to remain\nwhere they were for weeks perhaps. The cold had been unusually severe\nthat winter in the Baltic, and out over the plain of ice by which they\nwere surrounded they could see flags of all nations sharing a similar\nfate. There was nothing for it but to wait and hope; and if the ice did\nnot break up soon, short rations would become the order of the day.\n\nIt was wearisome; and to Salv\u00c3\u00a9 above all, who was feverishly longing to\nget home, and whose temperament was little suited for the endurance of\nsuch agonies of Tantalus. He became the very embodiment of restlessness.\nA hundred times a-day he went aloft to look out for some prospect of a\nchange, and to strain his eyes after the streak of land to the north\nwhich was to be made out on clear days from the maintop-gallant\nmast-head, and which of course would be the coast of Norway. The dress,\nthe silk handkerchiefs, the rings, and what he should say to\nElizabeth--whether he should formally request a private interview with\nher, or wait till an opportunity offered--were running incessantly in\nhis head. And particularly what he should say to her seemed now, often\nas he had thought it over during the long voyage and settled it to his\nsatisfaction, to present many points of difficulty. He must go down then\nto his seaman's chest and see if the things were still there all right,\nand whether the moths might not have got into them; the last inspection,\nwhen he unfolded the stuff in his bunk, being conducted with uncommon\nprecautions.\n\nAt last there came a prospect of release in the shape of thick weather,\nand a southerly gale setting on the Norwegian coast. The ice too had for\na day or two previously begun to show blue patches of water here and\nthere, and when it was dark that evening they felt themselves free once\nmore.\n\nIn spite of the salt water and the rain, which he had to wipe off his\nface every minute, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 went to his look-out post forward that night,\nand stood there humming to himself, whilst the rest of the crew who were\non duty slopped up and down on the deck-cargo below, in sea-boots and\ndripping oilskins, or sheltered themselves, as best they could, under\nthe lee of the round-house or forecastle. They had been hard at work all\nday, making openings in the ice; and now the groaning and whistling\namong the blocks and ropes, that were increasing every minute, gave\nlittle promise of rest for the night.\n\nThe captain stood upon the poop in his thick overcoat and drenched fur\ncap, with his trumpet under his arm, looking anxiously through the\nnight-glass from time to time, and his voice sounded unusually stern.\nThere lay before him in the dark, blustering, winter night a veritable\nDavid's choice. The strong southerly current, aided by the gale, was\nfast carrying him in under the Norwegian coast; while on the other hand,\nif he tried to beat to windward, he risked coming into collision with\nthe ice-floes. Added to that, he was not very clear as to his position;\nand as the gale increased, he began to pace restlessly backwards and\nforwards, addressing, every now and then, a word down to one of the\nhelmsmen, whose forms could be seen by the gleam from the binnacle.\n\n\"How's her head, Jens?\"\n\n\"Sou'-west, sir; she'll lay no higher.\"\n\n\"H'm! more and more on land!\" he muttered, the perspiration coming out\nupon his forehead under his fur cap, which, in spite of the rain, he had\nto push back to get air. Both life and ship would soon be at stake.\n\n\"What says the look-out-man, mate?\" he asked of the latter, who came up\nthe steps at this moment from taking a turn forward.\n\n\"Black as pitch. If we stuck a lantern out on the flying jib-boom, we\nshould see that far at any rate. But the lead gives deep water.\"\n\n\"Does it?\" was the rather scornful rejoinder.\n\n\"The blockhead doesn't seem to know yet,\" growled the captain, as the\nother turned away, \"that the lead will give you deep water here until\nyour vessel has her nose upon the cliff.\"\n\nThere was no chance of a pilot on such a night as this promised to be;\nbut still, in the hope that the wind might carry the sound in under\nland, a few shots were fired from the signal-gun.\n\nAt last there was no longer any choice left. If they were not to end\nupon the rocks that night, they must crowd on more sail, and try at all\nhazards to haul off the coast.\n\nThe order was accordingly given to shake a reef out, followed by \"Haul\nin the topsail bow-lines--clap on the topsail halyards, and hoist away!\"\nand in the darkness might be heard occasionally \"halimen-oh!-oh hoi!\" as\nthe sailors worked at the tough and heavy sail, with the cordage all\nstiff and swollen with ice and slippery with the rain, the spray driving\nin their faces, and the vessel rolling so that sometimes they were\nhanging on by the ropes only, when the deck went from under their feet.\n\nUnder the fresh weight of sail the vessel careened over, and shot\nfoaming forward with new life for a moment. The next, the topsail had\nburst away from the bolt-ropes with a report as of a cannon-shot, and\nshe had fallen away into the trough of the sea. The mainstay-sail sheet\nparted at the same time, and a deluge of water carried overboard, with\npart of the bulwarks, a large portion of the deck cargo, which consisted\nof heavy timber, leaving the remainder tossed about in the wildest\nconfusion, and much of it standing on end against the railings and\ncapstan.\n\nIt was some time before she could be brought up in the wind again, and\nthe old Juno had then to go through a trial such as her joints even in\nher younger days had never been equal to. She was like many another\nvessel that is a good sailor enough, a little broken-backed from the\nweight of the cargo amidships; and as she gave to the strain, the ladder\nthat stood in the hold began to saw up and down in the coaming forward,\nwhile the water came oozing in through the staring bow timbers, and the\npumps had to be kept continually going. The hatches were all battened\ndown, and many of the crew had lashed themselves to the lower rigging as\npreferable now to the deck.\n\n\"Ready about!--tacks and sheets!\" &c.; \"luff now, and keep her close to\nthe wind!\"--the same monotonous words of command all through the night\nevery time they lay over upon a new tack, while at the same time they\nwould generally ship a heavy sea, and the vessel would shake through all\nher frame.\n\nDay broke and passed in a fog, that left them in much the same\nuncertainty as before about their position. For one moment it had\nlifted, and they fancied they had seen \"Homborgsund's Fald,\" a high\nlandmark up the country above Arendal, and from its lowness and dimness\non the horizon, they had been encouraged to hope that they had\nappreciably increased their distance from the coast. About noon they\npassed an English brig that had been through the same struggle as the\nJuno was now engaged upon, whose signals of distress they had already\noccasionally heard faintly upon the wind, and which now seemed on the\npoint of foundering. The crew had climbed into the after-rigging, which\nwas all that now remained standing, and they made despairing signs for\nhelp; but it was impossible to render any. They had enough to do to keep\nthemselves afloat.\n\nThe gale showed no signs of moderating, and that night, as Salv\u00c3\u00a9\nKristiansen and another were taking their turn at the wheel, there\ngleamed suddenly out of the pitchy darkness to leeward of the\nfore-rigging the white crest of a tremendous eddy wave, which a moment\nafter came crashing down upon the deck, carrying clean away the\nround-house, binnacle, and long-boat, damaging the wheel, and leaving\nmany of the drenched and half--suffocated sailors deposited in the most\nunexpected places, and only glad to find that they still had the deck\nunder them.\n\n\"Ugly sea on the lee-bow!\" was heard again from forward, and all in that\ndirection seemed suddenly to have become a mass of white.\n\n\"Ready about!--hard a-lee!\" and with a great lurch the old craft went\nabout once more, the renewed shrieking in every kind of pitch in the\nrigging, and the blinding dash of spray, showing to what a hurricane the\ngale had risen.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 had been too much occupied with the damaged wheel at first to have\na thought to spare for anything else; but it recurred to him very soon\nthat when that first dark sea had broken over them so unexpectedly from\nleeward, he had seen for a moment the glimmer of two lights on its\ncrest, and a world of associations was at once aroused in his mind: it\nseemed to the lad's romantic fancy that he was keeping an appointment\nwith Elizabeth Raklev. As he glanced hurriedly back, the two light-dots\nagain appeared. He had seen them too often before to be mistaken, and he\nshouted over his shoulder to the captain, who noticed them now for the\nfirst time, \"Those lights behind to leeward are from old Jacob's hearth\non Torungen!\"\n\n\"Are you sure of that?\" muttered Beck, coming nearer to him at the same\ntime over the sloping deck with the help of a rope. \"If they are, it\nwill not be long before we are dashed to atoms on the rocks.\"\n\nA conversation ensued between them, in which Salv\u00c3\u00a9 declared that he had\nknown the water under Torungen from childhood as well as he did his\nfather's garden; and the upshot was that Beck, pale and hesitating,\ndetermined to go in under land with him as pilot.\n\n\"It is much that is being intrusted this night to two young shoulders,\"\nsaid he; \"and see you think twice, young man, both for your own life's\nsake and ours.\"\n\nThey kept away then, and stood in under land with the least sail they\ncould carry in the tremendous sea that was now breaking in their wake,\nand soon the thunder of the breakers became audible.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 was pale, but perfectly calm, as he stood there with the\nspeaking-trumpet, after having taken over the command, and with the\ncaptain and mate by his side. But all of a sudden great beads of\nperspiration came out on his forehead. There was something curiously\nirregular about the light. It had become dim and red, and then seemed to\ngo out altogether. Had he by any possibility made a mistake? and was he\nnow sailing the Juno with all on board straight for the rocks?\n\nThe uncertainty lasted for a quarter of an hour, and never in his life\nhad Salv\u00c3\u00a9 seen so heavy a countenance as that with which Beck, whose\nexpression discovered a trace of doubt, looked at him, evidently\nhesitating whether he should not take the command again himself.\n\nBut in the mean time the gleam of light shone forth again--whatever\nmight have been the cause of its obscuration--and that night Salv\u00c3\u00a9\nKristiansen brought the Juno safely into Merd\u00c3\u00b6.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nOut on Little Torungen meanwhile noteworthy events had occurred, which\nwere now the talk of the town.\n\nOld Jacob had had a stroke the week before, and had died the same night\nthe Juno had had her wrestle for life. In the preceding two days of fog\nand storm they had heard many signal-guns of distress, and his\ngranddaughter had during that time kept up the fire alone at night. It\nwas only as he was drawing his last breath, and she sat by his side and\nbent over him, forgetful of aught else, that it was for a while\nneglected; and it was this little moment that had caused Salv\u00c3\u00a9 such a\n_mauvais quart d'heure_ on board the Juno. On the following day, in her\ndespair, she had attempted a perilous journey over the drift ice to\nbring people out to her assistance, and had been taken up by a boat and\nbrought in by it to Arendal.\n\nThe poor girl was far too much occupied with her grief for the loss of\nher grandfather to think in the remotest degree of making her story\ninteresting. But Carl Beck, in his enthusiasm, knew very well how to\ngive the incident a colouring of romance, and she was very soon exalted\ninto the heroine of the hour. It was talked of at the Amtmand's--a house\nwith two handsome daughters, where Lieutenant Beck was a daily\nvisitor--and it was in everybody's mouth how, all alone out on Torungen\nwith her dying grandfather, she had been the means of saving the Juno,\nand had since risked her life on the ice. Every one could see by a\nglance at her that she must have a remarkable character; but as to her\nuncommon beauty there prevailed different opinions in feminine circles.\nIt was, at all events, a pity that she was so forlorn; and the Becks, it\nwas thought, were now morally bound to look after her.\n\nFor the present she had gone to live with her aunt up in one of the\nnarrow streets at the back of the town, and there came pouring in, with\nand without the owners' names, all sorts of friendly advice, with black\ndress materials and ornaments from the young men and shop lads; and a\ncouple of the bustling ladies of the town even came in person to see her\naunt and talk over the girl's future. When Carl Beck, however, gave out\nthat he looked upon these presents as slights upon himself, they ceased.\nHe had only been up there once, and then his eldest sister was with him:\nbut his manner on that occasion had been most attractive, he had\nsympathised with such winning sincerity, and at the same time so\nunassumingly, in Elizabeth's grief; and when leaving assured her, with\nemotion which he made no attempt to conceal, that they owed it to her\nthat their father was still alive.\n\nWhen he was gone, his sister had proceeded to the real matter of her\nvisit. She had come to propose to the aunt that Elizabeth should live\nwith them for the present with the view of qualifying herself for a\nhousekeeper's place, as she must not be exposed to the necessity of\ngoing out as a common servant-girl. It was her brother, she added, who\nhad made this plan for Elizabeth's future.\n\nThe offer was a highly desirable one for persons in their position, and\nwas accepted by the aunt with unmixed satisfaction. Over Elizabeth's\nface, however, there passed a momentary cloud. She felt, without knowing\nwhy, a sense of oppression at the prospect of coming into closer contact\nwith the young lieutenant; but at the same time she would not for a\ngreat deal have refused the offer.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nAs for Salv\u00c3\u00a9, during the first few days after coming home he was a happy\nman. He was in love: he had received from his captain a hundred-daler\nnote, accompanied by a promise that as soon as he had learnt navigation\nhe should be third mate on board the Juno; and he heard himself admired\non all sides by his equals and associates. There was so much work to be\ndone, though, in discharging the cargo and getting the vessel into dock\nfor repairs--they had managed to get her up as far as Arendal--that it\nwould be Saturday evening before he could get his so longed-for\nhome-leave.\n\nOn the day before, as he was sitting on watch in the early morning under\nthe lee of the bulwark, he accidentally overheard a conversation going\non upon the slip below that set his blood on fire.\n\nThe carpenters had just come to their work, and one of them was telling\nthe story of old Jacob's death, and of the heroism which his\ngranddaughter had displayed.\n\n\"They say,\" he went on, \"that Captain Beck is to have him buried on\nMonday next, and that he is to provide for the granddaughter--the navy\nlieutenant has seen to that.\"\n\nThe noise and the clinking of the hammers that were now at work made\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 lose a good deal of the conversation here.\n\n\"There is good reason for that, mind you,\" was the next observation he\ncaught, made in a somewhat lower tone, and accompanied by a doubtful\nlaugh. \"It is not for nothing that he has been out so constantly\nshooting sea-fowl about Torungen.\"\n\n\"Would she be a--sea-bird of that feather? Old Jacob, I should have\nthought, was not the kind of man--\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps not that altogether; but the first thing she did was to\ncome straight over here; and he has had her already taken into his own\nhouse. I have that from the aunt. The old woman had no suspicion of\nanything, but told me quite innocently that now she was to be a sort of\nhousekeeper with the Becks.\"\n\nA slight noise above him here caused the speaker to look up. A deadly\npale young sailor was staring down at him over the ship's side with a\npair of eyes that struck him as resembling those he had once seen in the\nhead of a mad dog. Their owner turned away at once and crossed the deck.\n\n\"That must have been the lover!\" he whispered over to the other, as he\nset to work with his adze upon the pencilled plank. Shortly after he\nmuttered in a tone of compunction--\n\n\"If I saw that physiognomy aright, some one had better take care of\nhimself when he gets leave ashore.\"\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 had sprung to his feet in a fury when he heard about young Beck,\nbut the desire to hear more had kept him spellbound. What further had\nbeen hinted of his relations with Elizabeth, and that the latter had\neven taken refuge in his house, seemed all only too probable. He knew\nboth the men who had been speaking; they were respectable folks, and the\none besides had had the news from the aunt herself.\n\nThere was hard work that day on board, but his hands were as if they had\nbeen benumbed. It was impossible for him to give any assistance, except\nin appearance, when any hauling was to be done;--he did everything\nmechanically.\n\n\"Are you sick, lad, or longing after your sweetheart?\" said the mate to\nhim in the course of the afternoon. He saw that there was something\nwrong with him.\n\nThat last, \"after your sweetheart,\" had a wonderfully rousing influence.\nHe felt himself all at once relieved of his heavy feeling of exhaustion,\nand worked now so hard that the perspiration poured down his face,\njoining in the hauling song from time to time with a wild, unnatural\nenergy: he was afraid to leave himself a moment for thought. When the\nday was over, however, he took the anchor watch for a comrade, who was\noverjoyed at the unexpected prospect of getting a quiet night in his\nhammock, and at escaping from his turn of \"ship's dog\"--that watch\nconsisting of one man only, whose business it is to keep the ship from\nharbour-thieves.\n\nHe paced up and down the deck alone in the pitchy darkness, that was\nonly relieved by a lantern or two out in the harbour, and a light here\nand there up in the town--sometimes standing for long minutes together,\nwith his cheek on his hand, leaning on the railing. He could, without\nthe slightest scruple, murder young Beck--that he felt.\n\nAt two o'clock he crossed over to the boards that were sloped against\nthe vessel's side, slid down them in the dark to the slip, and from\nthere made his way ashore. Elizabeth's aunt lived in one of the small\nhouses above; and he had determined to wake her and have a talk with\nher.\n\nWidow Kirstine was a portly, somewhat worn perhaps, but otherwise\nstrong-looking, old woman, with a good broad face, and thin grey hair\ndrawn down behind her ears. She was not unused to being disturbed at\nnight, one of her occupations being to nurse sick people; but she always\ngrumbled whenever she was. When she held up the candle she had lit, and\nrecognised Salv\u00c3\u00a9 Kristiansen, she thought, from his paleness and general\nappearance, that he was drunk.\n\n\"Is that you, Salv\u00c3\u00a9?--and a pretty state to be in at this time of\nnight!\" she began, severely, in the doorway, not caring to let him in at\nfirst. \"Is that the way you spend your wages?\"\n\n\"No, mother, it's not. I've come off my watch; I wanted to have a word\nwith you about Elizabeth.\"\n\nHis tone was so strangely low and sorrowful, that the old woman saw that\nthere must be something unusual the matter; and she opened the door.\n\n\"About Elizabeth, you say?\"\n\n\"Yes--where is she stopping now?\"\n\n\"Where is she stopping?--why, with the Becks, of course. Is there\nanything the matter?\"\n\n\"You ought to know that best, mother Kirstine,\" he said, earnestly.\n\nShe held up the light to his face, and looked at him in vague anxiety,\nbut could make nothing out of it.\n\n\"If I ought to know it, tell me,\" she said, almost in a tone of\nentreaty.\n\n\"Young Beck, I hear, has been out about Torungen the whole\nyear--shooting sea-birds--or--do you really think he means to marry\nher?\" he broke out wildly, and raising his voice.\n\nIt was only now that she caught his full meaning; and setting down the\ncandlestick hard upon the table, she dropped into the chair by the side\nherself.\n\n\"So--that is what they are saying, is it?\" she cried at last. Her first\nfear was over; but anger had succeeded to it, and she rose now from her\nseat with arms akimbo and flashing eyes. She was not a woman to offend\nlightly.\n\n\"So they have fastened that lie upon Elizabeth, have they!--it's a shame\nfor them, so it is! And you, Salv\u00c3\u00a9, can soil your lips with it? Let me\njust tell you, then, for your pains, that the Becks' house is as\nrespectable a one as any in Arendal; and it isn't you, and such as you,\nthat can take its character away. Never fear but Elizabeth shall hear\nevery word of your precious story--ay, and the captain, and the\nlieutenant, and Madam Beck, too; and you'll be hunted from the Juno like\na dripping cur. So you thought that Elizabeth was to be beholden to the\nlieutenant for a character--?\"\n\n\"Dear mother Kirstine!\" Salv\u00c3\u00a9 cried, interrupting her in the full\ntorrent of her indignation, \"I didn't think about it--I couldn't think.\nOnly, I heard Anders of the Crag down on the slip this morning say it\nall so confidently.\n\n\"Anders of the Crag? So it was from him you heard it?--the pitiful,\nwheedling rascal! That is his gratitude, I suppose, for my being with\nhis wife last week!--I shall know where to find him. But the receiver in\nthe like is no better than the stealer,\" she resumed, indignantly; \"and\nI'd have you know, it was just Beck's own daughter who came here and\noffered Elizabeth a respectable place in a respectable house, and it was\nto me she talked, my lad,\" pointing self-consciously with quivering\nforefinger at her own bosom; \"so Elizabeth has not begged herself in\nthere at all. You didn't need to desert your watch to bring such tales\nhere; and Elizabeth shall hear of it--that she shall,\" she repeated,\nexcitedly, striking one hand into the other with a loud smack--\"she\nshall hear what fine faith you have in her.\"\n\n\"Dear mother Kirstine! I didn't mean any harm,\" he said, entreatingly,\nfeeling as if a weight had been taken off his heart--\"only please don't\ntell Elizabeth.\"\n\n\"You may depend upon it I will.\"\n\n\"Mother Kirstine!\" he said, in a low voice, and looking down, \"I brought\na dress with me for her that I had bought in Boston. And then I heard\nall this, and I couldn't contain myself.\" He said nothing about the\nrings.\n\n\"So!\" rejoined the old woman after a pause, during which she had\nexamined him through her half-closed eyes, and in a somewhat milder\ntone; \"so you brought a dress for her! and at the same time you come\nrunning up here in the middle of the night to tell me that she has\nbecome a common baggage for the lieutenant,\"--and her anger rose again.\n\n\"But, Mother Kirstine, I don't believe a word of it.\"\n\n\"It wasn't to tell me that, I suppose, you came up here in such haste,\nmy lad.\"\n\n\"I was only mad to think such a thing could be said of her.\"\n\n\"Well, be off with you now! Anders of the Crag shall go farther with his\nlie--if I go with him before the Foged and the Maritime Court.\"\n\nFor the matter of that, she might as well have threatened to go with him\nto the moon; but Salv\u00c3\u00a9 understood her to mean by the Maritime Court the\nbloodiest course she knew.\n\nAs she opened the door to let him out, she said with a certain\nconfidential seriousness--\"Tell me, Salv\u00c3\u00a9! has anything passed between\nyou and Elizabeth?\"\n\nHe seemed uncertain for a moment what reply he should make to this\nunexpected invitation of confidence. At length he said--\n\n\"I don't know, Mother Kirstine, for certain; two years ago, I made her a\npresent of a pair of shoes.\"\n\n\"You did!--well, see now and get on board again without any one noticing\nyou--that's my advice,\" she replied, without allowing herself to be\nbrought any further into the matter, and pushed him then rather\nunceremoniously out of the door.\n\nAfter he had gone she sat for a while with the light in her lap, staring\nat it and nodding her head reflectively.\n\n\"He's a good and a handsome lad that Salv\u00c3\u00a9,\" she said at last, aloud.\n\"But on the whole it will be better to tell Elizabeth, and then she can\nbe on her guard there in the house;\" and having come to this decision\nshe rose from her seat and prepared to go to bed again.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9, notwithstanding this interview, was far from being at ease next\nday, and he felt the courage he had mustered up, to go straight to\nElizabeth with the dress and ring, altogether gone.\n\nIn the evening, when all the crew were given leave from the ship for\nthree weeks, he went off to his father instead, to see if he could learn\nmore of the situation through inquiries from him; and on the following\nMonday both were present at old Jacob's interment in Trom\u00c3\u00b6 churchyard.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\nAll these events had come upon Elizabeth with overwhelming suddenness.\nIt seemed to her like a confused dream. Yet the fact remained that there\nshe was, dressed in black, an inmate of one of those handsome houses,\nthe interiors of which she had so often pictured to herself out on\nTorungen.\n\nCaptain Beck was married to a second wife, a woman of stern principles,\nfull of decision and respectability, who had brought him a considerable\nfortune, and, under her lynx-eyed rule, had restored that order in\nhousehold matters which, during the period her husband was a widower,\nhad been far too much neglected; and though his power might still be\nabsolute on board the Juno, it had long since ceased to be so in his own\nhouse. By her grown-up step-children Madam Beck was in the highest\ndegree respected, though not exactly loved, owing to the various\nunaccustomed restraints to which they now found themselves subjected;\nand as to Carl, his easy tact, notwithstanding the independent position\nwhich he enjoyed in his home as salaried member of a coast commission,\nenabled him to keep on the best of terms with his imperious stepmother.\nHis duties would detain him about home for another year, to be still\nf\u00c3\u00aated by the town, and idolised by his sisters, who were never tired of\nspeculating upon eligible matches for him.\n\nFrom the very first, Elizabeth, who, in her utter ignorance how to\nbehave, committed one egregious blunder after another, had perceived\nwith her strong sense that it would require all the cleverness and\npatience she possessed to enable her to maintain the situation; and she\nbegan by following Madam Beck about untiringly like a lamb. Many a\npainful scene had she to go through during the earlier period of their\nconnection, and she bore them with a quiet gentleness which Madam Beck\ntook for modest docility, but which had its real origin in a fixed\ndetermination to succeed. Every now and then, however, she would give it\nup as hopeless, and would seat herself disconsolately by the window with\nher cheek upon her hand, and gaze wistfully out over the harbour. She\nlonged so for cold fresh air, and would end by throwing up the window\nand stretching herself with her heated face as far out of it as she\npossibly could, till Madam Beck would come in, and in a stern voice call\nher back. Madam Beck, in her irritation, used to say that it was almost\nas if they had taken a wild thing into the house.\n\nCarl Beck understood very well what she was going through, and would\noccasionally throw her an encouraging look; but Elizabeth affected\nalways not to understand it. On one occasion, however, when she was\ncorrected in his presence, she hurriedly left the room, and throwing\nherself on her bed, lay there and sobbed as if her heart would break.\n\nShe had been trusted one afternoon, shortly after, to bring in the\ntea-tray, on which, without thinking what she was doing, she had placed\nthe chafing-dish with the boiling teakettle. It fell as she was carrying\nit in; but although its hot side and the boiling water burnt and scalded\nher arm and hand, she carried the tray quite quietly out again without\nallowing a muscle of her face to change--she was not going to be\ncorrected before him again.\n\nMadam Beck herself bound up her hand in the kitchen, where she stood\nwhite with pain; while Carl, who had been sitting on the sofa, and had\nseen how the whole thing happened, forgetting his self-command, had\njumped up in great excitement, and had shown such uncommon sympathy that\nhis sister Mina, afterwards, when they were alone in the room together,\nsaid, with a look that was more searching than the joking words seemed\nto require, \"It is not possible you are fond of the girl, Carl?\"\n\n\"No fear, Mina,\" he answered quickly, in the same tone, chucking her\nunder the chin as he spoke. \"There are as handsome girls as her in\nArendal; but you can see as well as I can that she is a girl in a\nhundred. That business with the tea-tray is what very few others would\nhave been capable of; and we mustn't forget that if it had not been for\nher--\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" rejoined Mina, with a toss of her head, a little tired of the\neternal repetition of this stock observation. \"She didn't know all the\nsame that it was papa who was out there.\"\n\nIt was a game of hypocrisy, thought out with no inconsiderable subtlety,\nthat the handsome lieutenant was carrying on in this matter: under his\napparently so entirely frank sailor-bearing there was hidden a real\ndiplomatist. By trumpeting about the town the service which Elizabeth\nhad rendered them in saving the Juno, he had, one may say, forced his\nfamily to take her up, though to them he made it appear that public\nopinion left them no alternative. On the other hand, he was uncommonly\ncautious in his attitude towards Elizabeth herself; for he knew he must\nwin her without attracting the attention of his stepmother and sisters.\nHe believed he had made a sort of impression upon her; but at the same\ntime he felt that he had a wild swan to deal with, that might at any\nmoment spread its wings and fly away--there was such a strong,\nindependent individuality about her.\n\nIn his home, however, she had become a different creature, scarcely to\nbe recognised as the same Elizabeth,--so quietly did she go about,\nhardly conscious of his presence apparently--and so slavishly did she\nfollow the directions of the mistress of the house. This new aspect of\nher had put him in doubt for a while, but it was not very long before he\nsatisfied himself that he understood what it meant; and that little\naffair with the tea-tray, that was set down to awkwardness by the\nothers, had quite a different significance for him. He flattered himself\nthat she subjected herself to all this restraint for his sake; and\nwhatever the _d\u00c3\u00a9nouement_ might be, the situation was, at all events, an\ninteresting one.\n\nBut there was, on the other hand, something in her manner that kept him\nat a certain distance, and left him in uncertainty as to what line\nexactly he should take. The same had been the case whenever they had\nbeen together out on the island, and had in fact been the principal\ncause of his becoming more deeply in love with her every day. He had\nonce out there encountered a look in her steel-grey eyes which had given\nhim the impression that the opinion she entertained of him could in a\nmoment be reversed, and that least of all dare he allow her to feel that\nhe was appearing in the character of a lover; and it was for this reason\nhe had scarcely ever talked with her grandfather, and only casually with\nherself. The fact was, old Jacob had very well understood that the smart\nyoung navy-lieutenant did not come out there for his sake; and as he\ncould not very well shut the door in his face, he had very sensibly\nwarned his granddaughter against him. He explained to her that people of\nhis class were not in the habit of marrying a common man's child,\nalthough it happened far too often that they might play at love with\nthem. \"Such a lad as Salv\u00c3\u00a9 Kristiansen, now,\" he remarked, in\nconclusion, \"that is the sort of stuff that will not disappoint you;\"\nand he thought he had played the diplomatist there with some skill.\n\n\"I didn't understand you to mean that exactly, grandfather, that time\nyou were going to beat him,\" she said.\n\nThe old man was rather nonplussed for the moment, but he growled out\nsomething about youngsters requiring correction occasionally, and went\non, \"He's a god lad, I tell you; and if he came and made up to you, he\nshould have you without a moment's hesitation; and then I should be easy\nin my mind as to what would become of you when I'm gone.\"\n\nElizabeth made no further observation, but a certain expression about\nher mouth seemed to denote that she reserved to herself the liberty to\nhave an opinion of her own in this matter. Salv\u00c3\u00a9 Kristiansen had been\nvery dear to her as the only friend and confidant she had ever had; but\nsince she had seen the lieutenant, it had been he who had exclusively\noccupied her thoughts. All that had formed the ideal of her young\nenthusiasm had suddenly in his person appeared upon the rock; but\nwhether it was his uniform, or the bravery of the fleet, or himself,\nthat was the object of her admiration, she had never asked herself,\nuntil hurt and rendered thoughtful by that warning of her grandfather.\nNow, it was unmistakably himself, the handsome, brilliant embodiment of\nit all. But at the same time there sprang up in her nature an\nunconquerable feeling of pride, in obedience to the dictates of which\nshe absolutely resigned him, though still retaining her enthusiastic\nadmiration; and it was this double attitude of mind which her eyes\nexpressed, and which puzzled her admirer. When she heard afterwards from\nher aunt in Arendal that people had been talking about them, she felt it\ndeeply, and more than ever then had become sensible that there was an\ninvisible barrier between them.\n\nCarl's father meanwhile had been trudging daily over to the dry-dock to\nsee after the Juno, which had had to have her bottom scraped, her gaping\nseams caulked, and to undergo a general repair: he was hardly at home to\nmeals. It was a case of urgency, as the delivery of her cargo at its\ndestination could not be delayed beyond a certain time.\n\nAbout a month after Elizabeth had come into Captain Beck's house the\nJuno was ready for sea again; and Carl's sister came into the room\nsmiling one day then, and said--\n\n\"Elizabeth, there is a young sailor out in the porch who wants to speak\nto you; he has a parcel under his arm. Perhaps it is a present.\"\n\nElizabeth, who was bringing in the tea-things at the time, turned red,\nand Carl Beck, who was standing by the window, a little pale. She knew\nvery well that it was Salv\u00c3\u00a9, and for a moment she was almost frightened\nat his audacity. She had seen him a couple of times before, and had\nallowed him to feel that she was not particularly anxious for his\ncompany, in consequence of what her aunt had told her, and as she went\nout to see him now she trembled.\n\nHe looked at her for a moment or two without saying a word.\n\n\"Will you take this dress, Elizabeth?\" he said at last, almost harshly.\n\n\"No, that I won't, Salv\u00c3\u00a9. Such things as you have been saying about me!\"\n\n\"So you won't take it?\" he said, slowly and dejectedly. \"It is no use\nsaying anything more, then, I suppose.\"\n\n\"No, Salv\u00c3\u00a9, it is no use saying anything more.\"\n\nThe desolate expression of his face as he stood and looked at her, while\nhe asked, \"Am I to take it to sea with me, Elizabeth?\" went to her\nheart, and the tears rushed into her eyes. She shook her head\nnegatively, but with an almost despairing look, and disappeared into the\nhouse.\n\nThey could see in the sitting-room that she had been crying. But Carl\nBeck was a cold-blooded man, and merely lay at the window and looked out\nafter his rival, to see if he had the parcel under his arm as he went\nout of the gate.\n\nThat night Elizabeth lay awake. She had cried in her sleep, and had\ndreamed that she had seen Salv\u00c3\u00a9 standing down at the quay so wretchedly\nclothed and so miserable, but too proud to ask assistance of any one,\nand that he had given her such a bitterly reproachful look; and she lay\ntossing about, unable to get the dream out of her head. Presently there\ncame the noise of a riotous mob outside, and she got up and went to the\nwindow. The police were taking some one with them down the street. As\nthey passed, she saw by the light of the street-lamp for a moment that\nit was Salv\u00c3\u00a9. He was resisting with all his might, pale and infuriated,\nwith his blue shirt all torn open in the front, and there was an\nexpression in his face that--at any rate, she slept no more that night.\n\nThere had been a general _m\u00c3\u00aal\u00c3\u00a9e_, she heard next morning, among the\nsailors over in Mother Andersen's, on the other side of the harbour. It\nwas said that knives had been used, and that Salv\u00c3\u00a9 Kristiansen had been\nthe originator of the whole disturbance--without a shadow of protest,\nCarl Beck said; and proceeded then to put various interpretations of his\nown upon the affair. Elizabeth left the room, and for some days after\nwas pale and worn-looking, and more than usually reserved, Carl thought,\nin her attitude towards himself.\n\nCaptain Beck had paid Salv\u00c3\u00a9's fine and procured his release, and the\nafternoon before the Juno was to sail his father and younger brother\ncame on board to say good-bye to him. There was something strange in his\nmanner that struck them both; it was as if he thought he would never see\nthem again. He offered his father his hundred-daler note, and when the\nlatter would not take it, made him promise, at all events, to keep it\nfor him. The father attributed his unusual manner to distress of mind\nand depression on account of his recent adventure with the police; but\nas he was going ashore he said, in rather a husky voice--\n\n\"Remember, Salv\u00c3\u00a9, that you have an old father expecting you at home!\"\n\nThat evening and a great part of the night Salv\u00c3\u00a9 passed in the Juno's\nmaintop, gazing over at Beck's house as long as there was a light in the\nattic window. And when that went out it seemed as if something had been\nextinguished in himself with it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\nThe outer side of Trom\u00c3\u00b6, which lies off the entrance to Arendal, has\nonly the ordinary barren stone-grey appearance of the rest of the\nislands along the coast; a wooden church, with a little belfry like a\nsentry-box and serving as a landmark, which lies drearily down by the\nsea, and under which on Sundays a pilot-boat or two may be seen lying-to\nwhile service is going on, is the only feature for the eye to rest upon.\nThe land side of the island, on the contrary, presents a scene all the\nricher and livelier for the contrast. The narrow Trom\u00c3\u00b6 Sound, with its\nswarm of small coasters, lighters, pilot-boats, and vessels of larger\nbuild, suns itself there between fertile or wooded slopes and ridges,\nover which are scattered in every direction the red cottages of the\nsailor population, skippers' houses, and villas; and in every available\nspot, in every creek or bay where there is barely room for a vessel, the\nwhite timbers of ships in course of construction come into view. It is\nan idyllic dockyard, a very beautiful and very appropriate approach to\nNorway's principal seaport town; and whoever steams up it on a still\nsummer's day must enjoy a surprise that will not easily be effaced from\nhis recollection.\n\nAt the period of our story, indeed, the picture was far from being so\ncomplete or rich: but even then were becoming manifest the germs of the\nbustle and life which now pervade the place.\n\nOn one of the most beautiful points of the Sound peeped into view a\nsmall one-storeyed house with two small-paned attic windows projecting\nfrom its steep tiled roof, and with a pine-wood climbing the hillside\nbehind, which was the property of Captain Beck; and here, until, as he\nproposed to do in a couple of years' time, he retired from the sea and\ninvested his fortune in the shipbuilding yard which he had in view, his\nfamily generally took up their residence during the summer months.\nHither in the early part of this summer, too, they had repaired.\n\nIt was no life of idleness, though, which they lived out there: Madam\nBeck always made work for everybody, and had her own spinning-wheel in\nthe sitting-room. Her step-son had his occupation on land, and as much\nas he could do, as member of the coast commission. But he used generally\nto come over on Saturdays in his pretty sail-boat and remain over\nSunday; and on that day, too, some one or other family of their\nacquaintance in the town would make them an object for a pleasure party,\nand would usually spend the afternoon with them.\n\nCarl Beck was always in great force on these occasions. His brown face\nand frank sailor bearing and good looks would have been sufficient in\nthemselves to make him a favourite with the ladies. But, in addition to\nthese claims upon their interest, he had been known to most of the\nyounger ones among them from his schoolboy days, when he used to come\nhome on leave as a cadet, and he seemed to enjoy particular confidential\nrelations with nearly every one of them, or, at all events, to be in\npossession of some secret or other which only they two knew. They had\nall kinds of jokes and expressions from their younger days which were\nunintelligible to the rest; and what is vulgarly called \"chaff\" formed,\nperhaps, the staple of his conversation with them, varied now and then\nby a touch of sentiment, which was intended, by chance as it were, to\nopen up to them for a moment the real deeper nature which they might not\nhave suspected him of possessing. They used to twit him about his\ninclination to stoutness, and he used to joke about it too, and say he\nhad too good a time of it.\n\nAmong the Becks' most frequent visitors out there was postmaster\nForstberg's family, which included, besides the parents, a hobbledehoy\nson and their daughter Marie, a fair-haired girl some eighteen years of\nage, of quiet manners, and with an uncommonly clever face. Nobody said\nthat she was pretty, but nearly every one who knew her had the\nimpression that she was; and there was a certain indefinable harmony and\ngrace, not only about her perhaps rather small figure, but about\neverything she did. But if she was not considered pretty, it was agreed\non all sides that she had great sense; and among her friends she was\nalways the one they elected to confide in, whenever they had anything on\ntheir minds. That she never confided anything to them in return had,\ncuriously enough, never struck them; and for that matter, she was too\ncorrect and proper, they imagined, to have any heart affairs herself.\nShe was a confidential friend of Carl Beck's sisters, and especially of\nMina, who declared that she put her before all the rest of her\nacquaintance, and thought in her own heart that she was exactly the\nmatch for her brother.\n\nThe only one of the young girls in the circle with whom Carl Beck had\nhad no youthful acquaintance was Marie Forstberg; and it had been some\ntime before he discovered that the quiet girl was worth talking to. He\nused to be secretly annoyed then that the conversation when she was\npresent should lapse so easily into empty trifling; her mind was so\nclear and true, and she had such a beautiful smile for whatever she\napproved. Before her, therefore, he always displayed now the broad,\nmanly side of his character--which he could do with so much grace--and\nthe coquetry which was at the bottom of this was not without its effect.\nShe had always made rather a hero of him in her own mind, and he had\ncreated the flattering impression now that the light and flirting manner\nwhich he adopted towards young ladies, and which had rather qualified\nher admiration of him, had been due to his not having before found among\nthem any one that was worthy of a man's serious attention. He had begun\nconsequently to occupy a much larger share of her thoughts than she\nwould herself have been willing to acknowledge; and many of the\nconfidences of which she was the recipient at this time would, if her\nfriends had had a little more penetration, have been brought last of all\nto her.\n\nMarie Forstberg's attention had very soon been attracted to Elizabeth;\nand knowing her history, she tried very often to help her, and put her\nin the right way of doing things. At first she found her rather short\nand unapproachable, and could get nothing but \"yes\" or \"no\" from her;\nand there was something almost offensive in the brusque way in which she\nwould turn with an impatient flush from her mentor when she sometimes\ndidn't understand what was meant, and would do the thing in her own way.\nShe wouldn't see at first the various little good turns which the other\ndid her in her quiet, considerate way; but they were acknowledged at\nlast with a look that made amends for all her former obtuseness; and in\nspite of their different natures and unequal social position, these two\nwomen soon came to feel, if not exactly drawn to one another, mutually\ninterested in each other. At the same time, as Elizabeth was not blind\nto the diplomacy of the house, she had soon perceived that of all the\nyoung ladies who came there, Marie Forstberg was the one who had the\nbest chance, and who indeed best deserved to be the young lieutenant's\nbride; and although she tried to believe that she was merely a resigned\nlooker-on herself, she seemed to feel every Sunday, when Marie Forstberg\ncame, that a certain disagreeable impression had grown up in her mind\nabout her during the week which it took some time to thaw. When it did\nthaw, however, which in time it always did, she would feel attracted to\nher with redoubled warmth; and though their conversation might be\nostensibly occupied only with such subjects as laying the table or\ndishing the dinner, she would contrive to introduce into it anything and\neverything concerning the lieutenant which she thought might interest or\nrecommend him to her friend. Marie Forstberg couldn't help sometimes\nfixing her clear blue eyes searchingly upon her, to ascertain if there\nwas not some object underlying this communicativeness; but Elizabeth\nwould look so unconscious, as she stood there with her sleeves tucked\nup, busy with her work, that she dismissed the idea from her mind.\n\nIn this country life, although without a moment to call her own,\nElizabeth felt freer at all events than she had done in the town; and\nshe had made such rapid progress under Madam Beck's tuition, that the\nlatter's supervision was in many things no longer required. One part in\nparticular, the one which she might have been expected to find the most\ndifficult of all--that of parlour-maid--she filled to perfection; and\nher upright figure and expressive face attracted many an admiring glance\non Sundays, when in her becoming striped chintz dress and white apron,\nand with her luxuriant hair turned up in the simplest manner, she\ncarried the tea or coffee things out to the guests in the summer-house.\nShe could feel that Carl Beck's eyes were never off her as long as she\nwas in sight, and she seemed to know that it was she whom his eye\nwandered in search of first whenever he came home. In a hundred small\nways he made her conscious of the interest which he felt in her; and\nwhenever there was a commission to be particularly remembered, he never\ngave it to his sisters alone, but to her also.\n\nHis pretty pleasure-boat--a long, light, sharp-built yawl, with a red\nstripe along its black side, and two sloping masts--which he had lately\nhad built, lay often the whole week through moored in the bay under the\nhouse. He was very particular about the boat, and during his absence it\nwas to Elizabeth's sole care that she was intrusted. There was always\nsomething or other to be looked after; and when he came home he would\ngenerally subject her, in a jokingly harsh tone, to an examination,\nwhich he called holding a summary court-martial.\n\nSometimes on Saturdays he would come up the path waving in his hand a\nletter covered with post-marks. It would be from his father to his\nstepmother; and Madam Beck would generally read it by herself first, and\nthen it would be read aloud, Elizabeth listening with strained\nattention--she was always so afraid that there might be something bad\nabout Salv\u00c3\u00a9.\n\nOne Sunday she remarked that Carl wore in the buttonhole of his uniform\na wild flower which she had thrown away. It might have been the purest\naccident; but she knew that he had seen her with it in her hand. The\nsame day they had wild strawberries at dinner, and there were no\nstrangers, and he broke out all in a moment, \"Yes, I'd sooner ten\nthousand times have wild strawberries than garden ones. They have quite\nanother taste and smell.\"\n\nIt was a natural remark for any one to make. But she thought he had\nlooked with peculiar earnestness at her as he made it, and afterwards he\nhad fixed his eyes upon his plate for a long while without raising them.\nShe felt that the remark had been meant for her, and altogether that day\nthere was something about him that made her uneasy--he gazed at her so\noften.\n\nMadame Beck happened to have just then a long list of household\nnecessaries required from Arendal, and Carl said that if some one would\ngo with him in the boat the next morning to help him with the parcels,\nhe would execute her commissions himself. When Madame Beck suggested\nElizabeth he eagerly assented; but the colour rushed into Elizabeth's\ncheeks, and with an angry toss of her head, which she didn't make any\nattempt to conceal, she left the room.\n\nAs he was standing alone outside some little time after, she came up to\nhim, and said, looking him straight in the face--\n\n\"I don't go into Arendal with you, Herr Beck.\"\n\n\"No?--and why not, Elizabeth?\" he asked, with affected indifference, and\ntrying to meet her look.\n\n\"I don't go,\" she repeated, her voice trembling with pride and\nanger--\"that is all I have to say;\" and she turned from him, and left\nhim gazing after her, partly in confusion, and partly in admiration of\nthe magnificently proud way in which she crossed the turf to the house\nagain.\n\nThe expedition was given up; and in spite of Carl's _finesse_, it came\nout inadvertently that it was on account of Elizabeth having refused to\ngo alone in the boat with him, which Madam Beck found very commendable\non her part. Indeed she ought to have known herself, she said, that it\nwas scarcely proper; but at the same time, she was decidedly of opinion\nthat the more becoming course for Elizabeth would have been to speak to\nher mistress first.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\nThe house in the town was undergoing repairs this year, which kept the\nfamily out in the country until rather late in the autumn. But the\nglorious September days prolonged the summer, and they could still sit\nout on the steps in the evening and enjoy the beauty and the sentiment\nof the season, and the rich variety of the autumn tints reflected on the\nstill waters of the Sound.\n\nThe members of Carl's commission, with their president, were invited out\nthere one day, and it was made a great occasion, all the resources of\nthe house being brought into requisition to do them honour.\n\nCarl, although the youngest member of the Commission, and really only\nincluded in it to make up the required number, had been fortunate enough\nto distinguish himself upon it; and his sisters even thought that there\nmight be a question of an order for him--that distinction so coveted in\nNorway--if they made love sufficiently to the president. Carl professed\nto be quite superior to a mere external decoration of the kind, though\nlonging for it in his heart; and Marie Forstberg, whom he had not taken\ninto his confidence in the matter, was highly indignant with his sisters\nfor supposing that it should depend upon the president, and not upon\nCarl's own merit, whether he received it or not. Mina, however, had\ndeclared, with a great air of knowledge of the world, that people\ncouldn't trust to merit alone, and that, besides (and here she had laid\nher hand flatteringly on her friend's shoulder), they were not all so\nstrict and high-principled as Marie Forstberg; and so she paid her court\nto the president accordingly.\n\nIn the evening, when the gentlemen were sitting together out in the\nwood, and Elizabeth came out to them with a fresh supply of hot water\nfor their toddy, the said president thought proper to make a joke that\nbrought the colour to her cheeks. She made no reply, but the water-jug\ntrembled in her hands as she put it down, and as she did so she gave the\nspeaker such a look that for a moment he felt cowed.\n\n\"'Sdeath, Beck!\" he broke out, \"did you see the look she gave me?\"\n\n\"She is a proud girl,\" said Carl, who was highly incensed, but who had\nhis reasons for restraining himself before his superior.\n\n\"A proud girl indeed!\" returned the other, in a tone which implied very\nclearly that in his opinion impudent hussy would have been the more\ncorrect description.\n\n\"A good-looking girl, I mean,\" said Carl, evasively, by way of\ncorrection, and laughed constrainedly.\n\nElizabeth had heard what he said. She was hurt, and for the first time\ninstituted a comparison between him and Salv\u00c3\u00a9. If Salv\u00c3\u00a9 had been in his\nplace, he would not have got out of it in that way.\n\nLater on in the evening Carl met her alone, as she was putting things to\nrights out on the steps after the departed guests, and he said\nhalf-anxiously--\n\n\"I hope you didn't mind what that blustering old brute said, Elizabeth.\nHe is a very good fellow really, and doesn't mean anything by his\nnonsense.\"\n\nElizabeth was silent, and tried to avoid answering by going in with what\nshe had in her hands.\n\n\"Come, I won't stand your being offended, Elizabeth,\" he broke out\nsuddenly, firing up in a moment, and trying to catch her by the arm.\n\"That hand you work with is dearer to me than the hands of all the fine\nladies put together.\"\n\n\"Herr Beck!\" she exclaimed wildly, and with tears in her eyes, \"I leave\nthis house--this very night--if you say a word more.\"\n\nShe disappeared into the hall, but he followed her.\n\n\"Elizabeth,\" he whispered, \"I mean it in earnest.\" She tore herself\nhastily from him, and went into the kitchen, where his sisters were\ntalking together over the fire.\n\nCarl went out for a solitary walk over the island in the glorious\nstarlight night, and didn't come in till past midnight.\n\nHe had not meant what he said quite so decidedly in earnest; but now\nafter seeing her standing before him so wondrously beautiful, with tears\nin her eyes--now he meant it in real earnest. He was prepared to engage\nhimself, if necessary, in spite of every consideration.\n\nThe next morning he left in his boat for Arendal, having whispered to\nher, however, in passing, before he left, \"I mean it in earnest.\"\n\nThe repetition of these words threw Elizabeth into dire perplexity. She\nhad lain and thought over them the night before, and had thrust them\nfrom her with indignation, for they could mean nothing else than that he\nhad brought himself to dare to tell her that he had conceived a passion\nfor her, and she had quite determined to execute her threat and leave\nthe house.\n\nBut now, repeated in this tone!\n\nDid he really mean to ask for her hand and heart--to ask her to be\nhis--an officer's wife? There lay before her fancy a glittering expanse\nof earlier dreams that almost made her giddy; and the whole week she was\nabsent and pale, thinking anxiously of Sunday, when he was to return.\nWhat would he say then?\n\nAnd--what should she answer?\n\nHe didn't come, however, his duties having required him to make another\njourney that he had not reckoned upon.\n\nOn the other hand Marie Forstberg did appear, and felt at once that some\nchange or other must have come over Elizabeth, as she pointedly declined\nall assistance from her; and in the look which Marie Forstberg\nintercepted by chance, there was something even hard and unfriendly. She\nlaid her hand once gently upon Elizabeth's shoulder, but it produced,\napparently, absolutely no impression--she might as well have caressed a\npiece of wood; and when she returned to the sitting-room again, she\ncouldn't help asking, \"What has happened to Elizabeth?\" But the others\nhad not observed anything unusual.\n\nCarl Beck, contrary to his custom, came not on the following Saturday,\nbut before it, in the middle of the week; and he strode with hasty steps\nthrough the rooms when he didn't see Elizabeth.\n\nHe found her at last up-stairs. She was standing gazing out of the\nwindow on the landing, out of which all that was to be seen was the\nwooded slope of the hill and the sky above it. She heard his step--she\nknew that he was coming up-stairs--and felt a sudden indefinable sense\nof apprehension--a sort of panic almost--as if she could have jumped out\nof the window. What should she answer?\n\nWhen he came and put his arm round her waist, and asked in a low voice,\n\"Elizabeth, will you be mine?\" she felt, for the first time in her life,\non the point of fainting. She hardly knew what she did, but pushed him\ninvoluntarily away from her.\n\nHe seized her hand afresh, and asked, \"Elizabeth, will you be my wife?\"\n\nShe was very pale, as she answered--\"Yes!\"\n\nBut when he wanted again to take her by the waist, she sprang suddenly\nback, and looked at him with an expression of terror.\n\n\"Elizabeth!\" he said, tenderly, and tried again to approach her, \"what\nis the matter with you? If you only knew how I have longed for this\nmoment.\"\n\n\"Not now--no more now!\" she pleaded, holding out her hand to him.\n\"Another time.\"\n\n\"But you say 'Yes,' Elizabeth--that you are my--?\" But he felt that she\nwanted him to go now.\n\nAfter he had gone, she sat there on a box for a long time in silence,\ngazing straight before her.\n\nSo it had actually come to pass! Her heart beat so that she could hear\nit herself, and she seemed to feel a dull pain there. Her face, little\nby little, acquired a fixed, cold expression: she was thinking that he\nwas then telling his stepmother of their engagement, and fortifying\nhimself for her reception of the announcement.\n\nShe expected to be called down. But no summons came; and at last she\ndecided to go without being called.\n\nIn the sitting-room they were all quietly intent upon their several\noccupations. Carl was pretending to read a book; but he threw her a\nstolen, tenderly anxious look over the top of it when she entered.\n\nSupper was brought in, and everything went on as quietly as usual, even\nto his customary banter. To Elizabeth it seemed as if there was a mist\nover them all; and when Mina once asked if there was anything the matter\nwith her, she could only answer mechanically, 'No.' The question was\nrepeated later on, and received the same answer. She brought the supper\nthings in and took them out, as usual, and it seemed as if she could not\nfeel the floor under her feet, or what she carried in her hand.\n\nThe evening passed, and they went to bed without anything happening. But\nin the partial darkness of the stair-landing, he seized her hand\npassionately, and said--\"Good-night, my Elizabeth, _my--my_ Elizabeth!\"\n\nShe was not in a condition to return the pressure of his hand, and when\nhe approached his lips to her forehead, she hastily drew herself away.\n\n\"I came out here alone to tell you this, dear, dearest Elizabeth,\" he\nwhispered, with passion trembling in his voice, and making an effort to\ndraw her to him. \"I must be on land again to-morrow. Must I go without\none sign that you care for me?\"\n\nShe bent her forehead slowly towards him, and he kissed it, and she then\nimmediately left him.\n\n\"Good-night, my beloved one!\" he whispered after her.\n\nElizabeth lay for a long while awake. She would have given anything to\nhave been able to cry, but the tears would not come; and she felt as if\nshe was freezing internally. When at last she did fall asleep, it was\nnot of him she dreamt, but of Salv\u00c3\u00a9--the whole time of Salv\u00c3\u00a9. She saw\nhim gazing at her with that earnest face--it was so heavy with grief,\nand she stood like a criminal before him. He said something that she\ncould not hear, but she understood that he condemned her, and that he\nhad thrown the dress overboard.\n\nShe rose early, and tried to occupy her thoughts with other dreams--with\nher future as an officer's lady. But it was as if all that had before\nseemed to be pure gold was now changed to brass. She felt unhappy and\nrestless; and it was a long time before she could make up her mind to go\ninto the sitting-room.\n\nCarl Beck did not leave that morning. He had perceived that there was\nsomething on Elizabeth's mind.\n\nDuring the forenoon, when his sisters were out, and his stepmother was\noccupied, he found an opportunity to speak with her alone: she was in a\nfever, always waiting for him to have spoken to Madam Beck.\n\n\"Elizabeth,\" he said, gently smoothing her hair, for she looked\ndispirited, and stood with her eyes fixed upon the ground, \"I couldn't\nleave without having spoken to you again.\"\n\nShe still kept her eyes upon the ground, but didn't withdraw herself\nfrom his hand.\n\n\"Do you really care for me?--will you be my wife?\"\n\nShe was silent. At last she said, a shade paler, and as if with an\neffort--\n\n\"Yes--Herr Beck.\"\n\n\"Say 'du' to me--say Carl,\" he pleaded, with much feeling, \"and--look at\nme.\"\n\nShe looked at him, but not as he had expected. It was with a fixed, cold\nlook she said--\n\n\"Yes, if we are engaged.\"\n\n\"Are we not then?\"\n\n\"When is your stepmother to know it?\" she asked, rather dragging the\nwords out one after the other.\n\n\"Dear Elizabeth! These people at home here must notice nothing for--for\nthree months, when I shall be--\" But he caught an expression now in her\nface, and something in the abrupt way in which she drew her hand from\nhim, that made him keep back what he had originally intended to say, and\nhe corrected it hastily.\n\n\"Next week, then, I'll write from Arendal and tell my father, and then\nlet my stepmother know what I have written. Are you offended,\nElizabeth--dear Elizabeth? or shall I do it at once?\" he broke out\nresolutely, and seized her hand again.\n\n\"No, no--not now! next week--let it not be till next week,\" she cried,\nin sudden apprehension, returning the pressure of his hand at the same\ntime almost entreatingly--it was the first he had had from her.\n\n\"And then you are mine, Elizabeth?\"\n\n\"Yes, then\"--she tried to avoid meeting his eye.\n\n\"Farewell, then, Elizabeth! But I shall come back on Saturday. I can't\nlive for longer without seeing you.\"\n\n\"Farewell!\" she said, in a rather toneless voice.\n\nHe sprang down to the boat that lay waiting for him below; but she\ndidn't look after him, and went in with bowed head the opposite way.\n\nSmall things often weigh heavily in the world of impressions. Elizabeth\nhad been overpowered by what seemed to her the magnanimity of his nature\nwhen he had declared that he would elevate her into the position of his\nwife; she felt that it was her worth in his eyes which had outweighed\nall other considerations. That he should shrink from the inevitable\nconflict with his family she had on the other hand never for a moment\nimagined. She had no doubt felt herself that it would be painful, but\nhad stationed herself for the occasion behind his masculine shield. When\nhe now so unexpectedly began to press for time, at first even proposing\nto be away himself when the matter came on in his home, a feeling took\npossession of her which in her inward dread she instinctively clutched\nat as a drowning wretch at a straw, as it seemed to suggest a\npossibility even now of reconsidering her promise.\n\nShe had a hard and heavy time of it during the two days until Carl\nreturned; and the nights were passed in fever.\n\nOn Saturday evening he came, and the first he greeted was herself: he\nseemed almost, as she passed in and out of the room quiet and pale, as\nif he didn't wish any longer to conceal the relations now existing\nbetween them.\n\nHe had with him a letter from his father, which was read aloud when the\nmeal was over. It was dated from a South American port, and mention was\nmade in it of Salv\u00c3\u00a9 among others. Off Cape Hatteras they had had stormy\nweather, and had their topmast carried away. It remained attached by a\ncouple of ropes, and with the heavy sea that was running, was swinging\nbackwards and forwards, as it hung, against the lower rigging,\nthreatening to destroy it. Salv\u00c3\u00a9 Kristiansen had come forward in the\nemergency and ventured aloft to cut it adrift; and as he sat there the\nwhole had gone over the side. He fell with it, but had the luck to be\ncaught in a top-lift as he fell, and so saved his life. \"It was pluckily\ndone,\" ended the account, \"but nevertheless all is not exactly right\nabout him, and he is not turning out as well as he promised.\"\n\n\"I never expected very much from him,\" remarked Carl, with a\ncontemptuous shrug of his shoulders; \"he's a bad lot.\"\n\nHe didn't see the resentful eyes which Elizabeth fixed upon him for\nthese words, and she sat for a long while afterwards out in the kitchen\nwith her hands in her lap, silent and angry, thinking over them. A\nresolution was forming in her mind.\n\nBefore they retired to rest, Carl whispered to her--\n\n\"I have written to my father to-day, and--to-morrow, Elizabeth, is our\nbetrothal-day!\"\n\nElizabeth was the last in the room, putting it to rights, and when she\nleft she took a sheet of paper and writing materials with her. She lay\ndown on her bed; but about midnight she was sitting up by a light and\ndisfiguring a sheet of paper with writing. It was to this effect:--\n\n\"Forgive me that I cannot be your wife, for my heart is given to\nanother.--Elizabeth Raklev.\"\n\nShe folded the paper and fastened it with a pin for want of a wafer, and\nthen quietly opening the door of the room where Madam Beck was sleeping,\nplaced her lips close to her ear, and whispered her name. Madam Beck\nwoke up in some alarm when she saw Elizabeth standing before her fully\ndressed, and apparently prepared for a journey.\n\n\"Madam Beck,\" Elizabeth said, quietly, \"I am going to confide something\nto you, and ask for your advice and assistance. Your step-son has asked\nme to be his wife. It was last Sunday--and I said yes; but now I have\nchanged my mind, and am going back to my aunt, or farther away still, if\nyou can tell me how; for I am afraid he will follow me.\"\n\nMadam Beck stared at her in mute amazement, and at first put on an\nincredulous and rather scornful expression; but as she came to feel that\nit might all be true, she raised herself involuntarily higher up in the\nbed.\n\n\"But--why do you come with this now, particularly in the middle of the\nnight?\" she said, with a suspicious and searching look.\n\n\"Because he has written to his father about it to-day, and means to tell\nyou and the rest to-morrow.\"\n\n\"So--he has already written? That was his object, then, in bringing you\ninto the house here,\" Madam Beck added, after a pause, with some\nbitterness.\n\nIt seemed to strike her then that there was something noble in\nElizabeth's conduct; and looking at her more kindly, she said--\n\n\"Yes, you are right. It is best for you to go away--to some place where\nhe will not find it so easy to reach you.\"\n\nShe lapsed into thought again. Then a brilliant idea occurred to her,\nand she got up and put on her clothes. She had a man's clearheadedness,\nand her habits of management stood her in good stead on the present\noccasion. The Dutch skipper Garvloit, who had married her half-sister,\nhappened just a day or two before to have been inquiring for a Norwegian\ngirl, who would be able to help in the house; and here was just the\nplace for Elizabeth. She had only to go on board his vessel, that lay\nover at Arendal ready to sail.\n\nMadam Beck went into the sitting-room at once, and wrote a letter to\nGarvloit, which she gave to Elizabeth, together with a good round sum of\nmoney--wages due, she said; and half-an-hour afterwards Elizabeth was\nrowing over alone in the quiet moonlight night to Arendal.\n\nThe smooth sound lay full of shining stars between the deep shadows of\nthe ridges on either side, with a light from a mast here and there\ndenoting the presence of vessels under the land. A falling star would\nnow and then leave a stream of light behind it; and she felt a sense of\njoyous exultation that she could only subdue by rowing hard for long\nspells. She was like one escaped--relieved from some oppressive burden.\nAnd how she looked forward to seeing Marie Forstberg now!\n\nShe arrived in the town before daybreak, and went straight up to her\naunt's, to whom she announced that Madam Beck wished her to take a place\nin Holland with Garvloit, who was on the point of sailing. She showed\nher the letter--there was no time to lose.\n\nThe old woman listened to her for a while, and then said abruptly--\n\n\"There has been some difficulty with the lieutenant, Elizabeth?\"\n\n\"Yes, aunt, there has,\" she replied; \"he made love to me.\"\n\n\"He did--\"\n\n\"And first I said as good as yes. But I don't mean to have him--and so I\ntold Madam Beck.\"\n\n\"So you wouldn't have him?\" was the rejoinder, after an astonished\npause; \"and the reason, I suppose, was that you would rather have\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9?\"\n\n\"Yes, aunt,\" in a low voice.\n\n\"And why in the world didn't you take him, then?\"\n\nThe tears came into Elizabeth's eyes.\n\n\"Well--as people make their beds so they must lie,\" said the old woman,\nseverely--and betook herself then, without any further observation, to\nthe preparation of the morning coffee.\n\nAs Elizabeth went down to the quay, to get a boat to take her out to the\nmerchantman, she looked in at the post-office, where she found Marie\nForstberg already up, and busy in the sitting-room in her morning dress.\nShe was greatly astonished when Elizabeth told her of her new\ndestination.\n\nIt was such an advantageous offer, Elizabeth explained--an almost\nindependent place in the house; and Madam Beck had herself advised her\nto take it.\n\nBut though she used all her wit to keep the other off the scent, Marie\nForstberg found a want of connection somewhere, and Elizabeth could see\nit in her eyes. She asked no further questions, however; and when they\ntook leave of each other they embraced, in tears.\n\nOut at Trom\u00c3\u00b6 the surprise was great when it was found that Elizabeth had\ngone. Carl Beck had found her letter under the door, but had never\nimagined that she had left, and had gone out with it in violent\nagitation of mind and did not come home again till late in the\nafternoon. Madam Beck had in the meantime confided the matter to her\ndaughters, and they would understand, she said, that not a word of it\nmust be mentioned outside the house.\n\nAlthough his eyes sought for her unceasingly, Carl made no express\ninquiry after her till the evening, and when he heard that she was gone,\nand was perhaps by that time already under sail for Holland, he sat for\nawhile as if petrified. Looking scornfully at them then, one after\nanother, he said--\n\n\"If I thought that I had any of you to thank for this, I'd--\" here he\nseized the chair he had been sitting on, dashed it down upon the floor\nso that it broke, and sprang up-stairs.\n\nBut her letter was unfortunately clear enough--she loved another, and he\nknew, too, who it was.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\nIt was some months after. The Juno lay ready to sail in the roads of\nMonte Video, where she had taken in hides as part of her home cargo. The\nremainder, of coffee, she was to load at Rio, and in the meantime she\nhad filled up with coals for that port. She was lying in tropical\ncostume, with awnings over the fore and after deck as a protection\nagainst the fierce rays of the sun; and the crew were going about in\ncorrespondingly airy clothing, with open shirts and tucked-up canvas\ntrousers, brown and shiny with perspiration, and gasping after every\nbreath. It was the hottest season of the year. The pitch was melting in\nthe chinks between the planking of the decks, and the tar running down\nher sides.\n\nThey had lain thus for a couple of days, hoping to receive before\nstarting the post, which they had been disappointed in not finding on\ntheir arrival. And what a disappointment this can be, only those who\nhave been in one of these ships that go on long voyages can understand.\nIn foreign ports there may be many a wild pleasure to be enjoyed, but\nthe longing to hear from home is the strongest feeling among sailors\nafter all.\n\nThe mate had gone ashore to make one last inquiry before they sailed;\nand as the jolly-boat came alongside again, it was seen that he had the\nprecious packet in his hand. He sprang up the accommodation-ladder and\ndisappeared aft without a word to where the captain was sitting by a\nsmall table with a carafe and glass before him, mopping his bald head in\nthe heat.\n\n\"You've got them at last, then,\" he said, as the mate laid the packet on\nthe table before him, and retired a few paces while he opened it.\n\nAlmost the first letter that caught his eye was one to himself from his\nson, and his face brightened. He ran rapidly over the others, making a\ncomment here and there according as he was acquainted with the\ncircumstances of the men to whom they were addressed, and gathering them\nup in a bundle, handed them over then to the mate, with a cheery \"Here\nyou are, Mr. Johnson--letters for every one, from wives and sweethearts,\nand I don't know whom besides.\"\n\nThe news that the post had come had spread like wildfire over the ship,\nand by the time the mate began to call out the addresses by the main\nhatch, the whole crew were assembled, with the exception of a straggler\nor two who had happened to be aloft, and who were now to be seen\nhurrying down the ratlines.\n\nThe only one who neither expected news, nor cared apparently whether he\nreceived a letter or not, was Salv\u00c3\u00a9 Kristiansen. While the parcel was\nbeing distributed, he remained standing by the wheel, intent apparently\nupon watching the movements of the two men who were hoisting up and\nmaking fast the jolly-boat. His lips were compressed; and when he gave\nthe men a hand now and then, it was not a very willing one, and was\ngenerally accompanied by some bitter or sarcastic remark. His nature\nsince they last sailed from Arendal seemed to have turned to gall; and\nwhen the captain had casually mentioned in his letter home that he was\nnot so well satisfied with him, he had had good reason for saying so.\nThere had been all sorts of unpleasantness between them; and if any\ndiscontent or difference between himself and the crew prevailed, Salv\u00c3\u00a9\nwas sure to be at the bottom of it. He had found a rancid salt-herring,\nset up on four legs with a tail, as he was walking on the poop one\nevening in the moonlight; and as complaints had been recently made about\nthe food, a good deal of which had become worse than bad from the\neffects of the hot climate, he had at once attributed to Salv\u00c3\u00a9 this\npointed method of drawing his attention to the subject again. It seemed\nalmost as if he had some cause for bitterness against himself\npersonally; and as he had always treated him with marked favour, he was\nat a loss to comprehend the reason for it.\n\nWith the exception of the captain, who had retained his seat at the\nafter-end of the poop, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 was soon the only human being to be seen on\ndeck. The whole crew had disappeared, and might have been found poring\nover their letters two and two, or singly, in the most out-of-the-way\nplaces, from the main and fore top even to the bowsprit end, where one\nhad erected a pavilion for himself out of a fold of the hauled-down jib.\n\nCaptain Beck's letter, to judge from his gestures and half-audible\nexclamations, was not giving him the pleasure which he had anticipated.\nHis whole face, up to the top of his head, had become red as a lobster,\nand he sat now drumming with one hand on his knee, and casting an\noccasional fierce look over at Salv\u00c3\u00a9, in the attitude of a man beside\nhimself with anger. At last he brought the hand in which he held the\nletter down upon the table with a force that sent the decanter and glass\nflying, and thrusting the fragments aside with his foot, he strode up\nand down the deck for a couple of minutes and then came towards Salv\u00c3\u00a9 as\nif he meant to say something; and as the latter could very well perceive\nthat it was not going to be anything pleasant, his countenance assumed\nan expression of defiance accordingly. He changed his mind, though,\nbefore he reached him, and turning short round shouted instead--\n\n\"Where is the second mate? Where is the whole watch?\" and he looked\nfuriously about him, as if surprised, although he knew very well how\nthey were occupied, and that it had been decided not to weigh anchor\nuntil later in the day, when they would have the evening breeze.\n\n\"Ay, ay, sir!\" was heard from the mate in the long-boat; and he raised\nhimself and came forward with the letter he had been reading in his\nhand.\n\n\"Stand by to man the windlass! Pipe all hands!\" ordered the captain, and\nroared the command again gratuitously through the trumpet.\n\nThe crew turned out from their several retreats with sour looks. They\nhad expected to be left alone until after tea-time, when there would\nhave been a general interchange of news on the forecastle; and now there\ncame instead a hail of orders from the speaking-trumpet, as if the\ncaptain had all of a sudden become possessed.\n\nThere was already a good deal of discontent prevailing among the crew,\nboth on account of the bad food which they had to put up with, and on\naccount of their leave ashore at Monte Video having been, as they\nthought, capriciously refused; and it was therefore something more\nnearly approaching to a howl than a song that was now heard from the\ncapstan and from the party who were hoisting the heavy mainsail. The\ncustomary English chorus--\n\n    \"Haul the bowline,\n     The captain he is growling;\n     Haul the bowline,\n     The bowline haul\"--\n\nwas sung with offensive significance; and though, at the last heavy\nheave with which the enormous anchor was catted up to the bows, the mate\ntried to create a diversion in the feeling by a cheery \"Saat\n'kjelimen--hal' paa,\" the concluding words of the song--\n\n     \"Aa hal i--aa--iaa--\n     Cheerily, men!\"--\n\nwere delivered in a scornful shout.\n\n\"You'll have a chance of cooling yourselves presently, my lads,\" said\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9, coming up at the moment from his own heavy work with the\ncross-jack; \"when we weather the point, all the lee-sails have to be\nset\"--and the remark had the effect which he desired of intensifying the\nprevailing irritation.\n\nIn spite of the vertical heat, the hail of orders from the captain's\ntrumpet continued, accompanied by reprimands and fault-finding all\nround, until the crew were nearly in a state of mutiny, and it was not\nuntil late in the evening that he showed any signs of exhaustion.\n\nHis temper had not improved next day. He looked as if he had a\ndetermination of blood to the head; and every time he came near Salv\u00c3\u00a9,\nhe glared at him as if it was all he could do to control himself from an\noutburst of some kind or another. He knew that Salv\u00c3\u00a9 had made love to\nElizabeth, and had wished to make her presents since she had come into\nhis house; and that the same girl was now to be his son's wife--the idea\nwas absolutely intolerable!\n\nAt last he could contain himself no longer. Salv\u00c3\u00a9 had just deposited a\ncoil of rope aft, and the captain, after watching his movements with\nevidently suppressed irritation, broke out suddenly, without preface of\nany kind--\n\n\"You, I believe, had some acquaintance with that--that Elizabeth Raklev\nI took into my house.\"\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 felt the blood rush to his heart. He seemed to know what was\ncoming.\n\n\"The post,\" the captain continued, in a bitterly contemptuous tone, \"has\nbrought me the delightful intelligence that my son has engaged himself\nto her.\"\n\n\"Congratulate you, captain,\" said Salv\u00c3\u00a9. His voice almost failed him,\nand he was deadly pale, but his eyes flashed with a wild defiance.\n\nHe went forward, and the captain growled after him to himself, \"He can\nhave that to fret over now instead of the food;\" and as the mate was\ncoming up the cabin stairs at the moment polishing the sextant, he\nturned away with a look of grim satisfaction to take the altitude.\n\nWhen the Juno last sailed from Arendal she had changed two of her crew.\nOne of the new hands was a square-built, coarse-featured,\nuncouth-looking creature, from the fjord region north of Stavanger, who\ncalled himself Nils Buvaagen, but whose name had been changed by the\nothers to Uvaagen (not-awake), on account of his evident predisposition\nto sleep. He was incredibly _na\u00c3\u00afve_ and communicative, especially on the\nsubject of his wife and children (of which latter he apparently had his\nnest full), and had soon become the butt of the ship. Salv\u00c3\u00a9 was the only\none who ever took his part, and that only because he saw all the others\nagainst him; and having also been the means of saving his life when he\nhad been washed overboard one dark night in the English Channel, he had\ninspired the simple fellow with a perfectly devoted attachment to him.\n\nThey were up on the mainyard together that evening, where they had been\nhelping to carry out an order with the mainsail. The rest had gone down\nagain, but Salv\u00c3\u00a9, who felt a longing to be alone, had remained aloft,\nand was standing on the foot-rope, with his elbows resting on the yard.\nNils's sympathetic eyes had perceived from his behaviour and whole\nappearance that day that there was something unusual the matter with\nhim; and when he saw that Salv\u00c3\u00a9 remained behind, he remained too,\nobserving that it would be pleasant to cool for a while before going to\ntheir hammocks in the close air between decks.\n\nThe sky above them blazed like a cupola \"inlaid with patines of bright\ngold;\" obliquely from the horizon the Southern Cross was rising, and the\nevening star shone in the warm night, before the moon had yet risen,\nwith a silver gleam that threw clear light and shadow upon the deck\nbelow; while the vessel seemed to plough through a sea of\nphosphorescence, leaving in her wake a long trail of bluish glittering\nlight.\n\nFrom the forecastle below came wafted up a sentimental sailor's song,\nthe burden of which was pretty well summed up in the two concluding\nlines:--\n\n     \"But never more her name I'll utter till I die,\n     For rosy though her lips were, her heart it was a lie.\"\n\nIt sounded melancholy at that hour, and Nils, to judge from the\noccasional sighs with which he had accompanied it, was moved. When it\ncame to an end, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 turned suddenly to him.\n\n\"You are distressing yourself for another's sweetheart now, Nils. What\nwould you have done if it had been your own?\"\n\n\"My wife!\" He had evidently not for the moment taken in the idea, and\nlooked with all his heavy countenance at Salv\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n\"Yes. Wouldn't you have liked to see her sunk to the bottom of the sea?\"\n\n\"My Karen to the bottom of the sea! I'd go there myself first.\"\n\n\"Yes; but if she had been unfaithful to you?\" persisted Salv\u00c3\u00a9, seeming\nto take a fiendish delight in bringing home the idea to the poor fellow.\n\n\"But she is not,\" was the rejoinder.\n\nNils had no genius for the abstract, and no more satisfaction was to be\ngot out of him. But at the same time he had been shocked, and went down\nshortly after without saying a word.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 still remained aloft, the dull consciousness of Elizabeth's\nengagement with the captain's son alternating with a more active desire\nfor revenge upon the captain himself for the manner in which he had\nconveyed the information; and the result of his brooding up there upon\nthe yard was a determination to desert as soon as the Juno arrived at\nRio. He would never go back to Arendal; and he would no longer tread the\nsame deck with the father of Carl Beck.\n\nLater on in the night, when the moon had risen, Nils, who had not been\nable to sleep in his hammock, came up to Salv\u00c3\u00a9 again, and drew him aside\nbehind the round-house, as if for a private conversation.\n\n\"What would I have done? you asked. I'll tell you,\" he said, after a\nshort pause, and his honest face seemed to express a vivid realisation\nof the whole misery of the situation. \"I would have died upon the\ndoorstep!\"\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 stood and looked at him for a moment. There came a strange pallor\nover his face in the moonlight.\n\n\"Look you,\" he said, ironically, laying his hand upon the other's\nshoulder, \"I have never a wife; but all the same, I am dead upon the\ndoorstep--\" Then, in the next breath, and with a sudden change of tone,\nhe said, \"Of course I am only joking, you know,\" and left him, with a\nhard, forced laugh.\n\nNils remained where he was, and pondered, not knowing exactly how to\ntake it. It was possible Salv\u00c3\u00a9 had only been making fun of him. But\nanother feeling eventually predominated. It told him that he had had a\nglimpse into a despairing soul; and he was profoundly moved.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\nThey stood slowly away to the north-east along the coast of Brazil.\nEvery morning, towards the end of the dog-watch, when the sun rose in\nits gorgeous majesty from the sea, there came a refreshing breeze off\nthe land, bringing with it the perfume of a thousand aromatic herbs;\nalbatrosses and sea-gulls circled round the ship; flying-fish were to be\nseen in shoals; and all nature, animate and inanimate, seemed to be\nfreshened for the time into activity and life. But gradually the breeze\nwould become warmer and lighter, and then die away altogether, so that\nbefore noon the sails would hang flapping against the mast. They\nscarcely made five knots in the watch, and the heat during the greater\npart of the day was unbearable--as unbearable almost as the captain's\ntemper, which showed no signs of improvement, and which vented itself in\na systematic grinding of the crew, who, Captain Beck declared, were\ngetting into intolerable habits of idleness.\n\nStrange things occurred on board just at this time, which, taken in\nconnection with the captain's mood, produced an uncomfortable feeling\nthat there was some evil influence at work by which both the ship and\nthe captain were possessed. Groans had been distinctly heard down in the\nhold among the coals; and the sailmaker affirmed that on several nights\nin succession he had seen a man go from amidships aft along the bulwark\nrailings, stand still and point with his hand to the compass, and then\ndisappear in the wake of the ship. Another declared that he had seen the\nship's genius proceed in the same direction and jump overboard--cap and\nall he was no higher than a half sea-boot; and when the genius deserts a\nship, it betokens in the sailors' superstitious creed that she is about\nto founder.\n\nThe unaccountable sounds in the hold continued, and changed one day when\nthe hatch was battened down to a kind of wail, which ceased, however,\nwhen, for fear of an explosion of coal-gas, it was taken off again. On\nthe following day the cook, who had gone down for water, came hurrying\nback with a scared face, and declared that he had seen a man sitting\nthere in a red jacket.\n\n\"It is the ship's genius lamenting the ship,\" was hesitatingly suggested\nby some. But when the cook objected that the creature was at least as\nlarge as Big Anders the boatswain, and proceeded besides to endow him\nwith sable colouring and claws, the terror reached its height.\n\nThe captain had hitherto replied to these, as he conceived them, fresh\nattempts to provoke him, by still further grinding; but when this last\nobservation of the cook was communicated to him, he broke out\nscornfully, pointing at the same time with the bitten mouthpiece of his\nold meerschaum pipe at the speaker--\n\n\"I think there is a sufficiently stupid devil in the hold sticking in\nevery one of you rascals. Isn't there one of you with courage enough to\ngo down into the coal-hold? or must I go myself?\"\n\nThe first mate proposed to accompany him; but Salv\u00c3\u00a9 now came forward and\ndeclared that he, for his part, would as soon go down into the hold as\nup aloft. \"A man won't sweat half as much at that work,\" he added, with\nsarcastic significance.\n\nHe went down accordingly with a light, and after a few moments' search\ncame upon a miserable, half-famished wretch, who had squeezed himself in\nbehind the water-butt. He was as black as a negro from the coal-dust,\nand declared tremblingly when he came up on deck, that he had deserted\nfrom his regiment in Monte Video, which was an offence punishable by\ndeath, and that he had thought he might remain concealed until the\nvessel arrived at Rio; that he had come on board in the dark on the last\nevening they lay in the harbour, and had hidden himself under the coals;\nand that when they had battened down the hatch he had been nearly\nsuffocated with coal-gas, and had lain and groaned. Occasionally he had\nfound an opportunity at night in the dark to climb up into the\njolly-boat astern, and had lain there and breathed fresh air until\nnearly sunrise. Once or twice he had been into the caboose and got\nsomething to eat; and sometimes he had stopped by the compass, as it\nseemed to him their journey was never coming to an end, and he wanted to\nassure himself that the vessel was really steering a northerly course to\nRio, as he had heard from some one in the harbour she intended to do.\n\nHe was a young, slightly-built man, with small quick eyes, about Salv\u00c3\u00a9's\nheight, and apparently a Spaniard or Portuguese, but could make himself\nunderstood in English.\n\nThe captain had some doubts as to the truth of his story, as his rank\nappeared to be superior to that of a common soldier; and from his\nanxiety not to betray his presence in the ship, even after they had got\nout into the open sea, he concluded that he was a political refugee, who\nat that time would not be very safe even at Rio. He ordered food to be\ngiven him, and promised that he should make his way ashore as best he\ncould, but that he was not to expect help from him, as the captain had\nno intention of involving himself with the authorities on his account.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9, who, like the generality of sailors, could talk a good deal of\nEnglish, gradually attached himself to the Spaniard, and found him an\nentertaining and clever fellow.\n\nBefore a light afternoon breeze they glided at last from the sea into\nthe narrow channel that runs up to Rio de Janeiro--one of the loveliest\nin the world, with majestic granite mountains on either side, one of\nwhich was already blazing in the ruddy light of the evening sun, while\nthe other in shade stood out a deep violet against the clear blue of the\nsky above. On the one side, at the foot of the Sugarloaf Mountain, they\nhad the fortress of Praja; on the other, the Castle of Santa Cruz; and\nfacing them on the highest point in the harbour, the slender\nsignal-tower that announces every ship as it appears at the entrance of\nthe channel.\n\nSo beautiful was the scene that under its softening influence Salv\u00c3\u00a9 felt\nalmost inclined to regret his determination to desert. The feeling,\nhowever, lasted no longer than the beauty which produced it. The soft\nlights died away upon the hills, and with them the softer feelings which\nhad crept in upon his heart. Night settled down upon the outer world,\nand with it returned the gloomy thoughts that now for many days had made\nhis mind their home.\n\nIt had occurred to him that the Brazilian would have it in his power to\nassist him in effecting his purpose, when they arrived in the harbour,\nand he had, therefore, found opportunities of rendering him indebted to\nhim for many small services. He lent him clothes now to appear among the\nother sailors when they were mustered before the authorities, who came\non board immediately after the ship entered the harbour, and it thus\nescaped their notice that there was one over the number returned by the\ncaptain as his crew.\n\nThe harbour pilot, however--a consequential Mulatto in a Panama hat and\nred feather, and decorated with a badge and staff--was more\nsharp-sighted, and soon perceived, from the irritable tone in which the\nsong at the capstan was sung again as they warped the vessel round to\nher anchorage in the Ilha das Cobras basin, that there was discontent\nprevailing on board; and it was no doubt owing to a hint from him that\nalready the same evening there were \"runners\" waiting about near them on\nthe quay.\n\nCaptain Beck was out of humour both with himself and with his crew. Down\nin a warm climate he was always irritable, and now that he believed his\nauthority weakened he had become a perfect tyrant. The prospect of\nanother voyage under his command was more than many of his crew could\nface, and preparations were made by many of them to leave the ship as\nsoon as they should have received whatever portion of pay on account the\ncaptain proposed, as is customary when a vessel is in harbour, to\ndistribute. Salv\u00c3\u00a9, however, did not wait for this, and already, the\nsecond night, he and the Brazilian had disappeared.\n\nThere was a sharp search instituted, with the assistance of the harbour\npolice, especially in the house of one particular runner who had been\nseen talking with the crew. But he gave them such full liberty to search\nhis house, and showed such a clear conscience in the matter, that the\npolice had to admit that they were off the scent this time.\n\nThe captain after this intrusted the nightwatches only to those among\nthe crew upon whom he could place reliance, hauled off from the quay\nevery evening, and absolutely refused all leave on shore. He had only\nreceived the thanks he deserved, he remarked bitterly, for having helped\nthat red-jacketed thief, who, by way of return, had taken from him his\nbest man. Salv\u00c3\u00a9's desertion, indeed, irritated him more than he cared to\nadmit to himself. He had, according to promise, had him taught\nnavigation by the first mate on the voyage out; and had settled in his\nown mind that when he himself retired from the sea Salv\u00c3\u00a9 should command\nthe Juno for him. He certainly never would find another of equal\ncapacity, and at the same time so thoroughly to be depended upon; and\nnow all his comfortable plans were upset.\n\nBefore leaving the vessel Salv\u00c3\u00a9 placed his silver watch, on which he had\nscratched with the point of his knife, \"In remembrance of Salv\u00c3\u00a9\nKristiansen,\" in the waistcoat pocket of Nils, who was snoring loud and\nlong in his hammock alongside; and then, unobserved by the watch on\ndeck, the two friends clambered over to the quay in the silent night by\nmeans of the shore rope, and disappeared at once into the darkness of\nthe neighbouring alleys. The Brazilian appeared to be well acquainted\nwith the localities, and anxious at the same time; for he avoided the\nlighted streets, and often stopped at dark corners to reconnoitre, and\nsee that the way was clear of the night police.\n\nAfter picking their way for an hour among narrow lanes, they came out\ninto a suburb where the houses began to alternate with garden walls,\nover which hung orange-trees diffusing their heavy perfume through the\nquiet night. They had to cross an open place to the other suburb, Mata\nPoreas, and upon the rising ground to one side of them they saw a\nbuilding that looked like a fortress enclosed by a stone wall, which\ncaused Salv\u00c3\u00a9's comrade considerable perturbation. It was the house of\ncorrection, before which there was always a sentry on duty.\n\nThey passed it, however, unchallenged, and after half-an-hour's further\nwalking, the Brazilian halted at last before a garden wall, in which\nthere was a small wicket gate. He looked cautiously round him and said\nexcitedly--\n\n\"We must climb over here, and then--we are safe.\"\n\nHe climbed up on Salv\u00c3\u00a9's back, and so on to the top of the wall; drew\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 up beside him, and then sprang down into the little garden and\nbegan to roll about on the grass as if he had taken leave of his senses,\ncrying, \"Salvado! Salvado!\"\n\nHe rushed up then to the little villa that lay half overshadowed by\ntrees, and knocking in a particular manner at the door, called out\n\"Paolina! Paolina!\"\n\nA female in night-dress, with a young, but rather deep voice, opened the\nshutter from within, and put out her head.\n\n\"Federigo!\"--she said, tremblingly; and there followed then a rapid\ninterchange of questions and answers in Spanish which Salv\u00c3\u00a9 did not\nunderstand. He gathered merely that she was surprised to see a stranger\nwith him, and that he calmed her apprehensions with the word \"amigo,\"\nfollowed by a short explanation.\n\nShe opened the door, and fell impulsively on Federigo's neck, kissing\nhim on both cheeks, and sobbing. After the custom of the place, then,\nshe offered her cheek to Salv\u00c3\u00a9, and was a little surprised when he\nseemed not to understand her meaning, and nodded merely, as he said,\nhalf in English, half in Spanish, \"good evening, se\u00c3\u00b1orita.\" It seemed to\nremind her, however, that in her eagerness she had forgotten her\nmantilla, and she left them hastily.\n\nShe came back to them again in the sitting-room almost immediately with\nbread, wine, fruit, and lights upon a tray; and stationed herself then\nin a sympathetic attitude with her arm on her brother's shoulder, while\nhe, with lively gestures, recounted his adventures. Federigo's story\nseemed to be reflected from her face as from a living mirror. At one\npoint her face became pale with passion; her black eyes flashed, and she\nmade a sudden movement with her clenched hand in the air, as if she were\ngiving some one a stab with a dagger. She threw her head back then with\na triumphant, scornful laugh that showed her dazzling white teeth; and\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 inferred that her brother must have killed some person or other in\nMonte Video, probably in self-preservation, and that he was afraid the\npolice here, in Rio, should have had information of it.\n\nHe sat and gazed at her. She was a lithe, supple-looking woman, at once\ngraceful and fully developed; a dark beauty of the style peculiar to the\nSouth, with wonderful animation in her face, and dark flashing eyes. At\nthe same time the play of her features was not pleasing, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 thought.\nIt reminded him too much of her brother--it was not feminine; and he was\nfurther repelled by the way in which she repeatedly allowed her eyes to\nrest upon him. He didn't know why, but Elizabeth's deep, true northern\nface came so vividly before him then, that he felt he could have drawn\nit to the life.\n\nThe not very flattering expression which this comparison had caused his\nface unconsciously to assume as he looked at her, was caught,\nunfortunately, by Paolina, as she was on the point of tendering him her\nthanks in her impetuous way for what she heard he had done for her\nbrother. She stopped short in surprise, and evidently repressed a\nvehemently resentful impulse, while a look unpleasant for him came into\nher eyes. She went over then and took him by the hand in the same way\nshe had seen him take her own on his arrival, and spoke coldly enough a\nfew words which were meant to convey her thanks. She didn't look at him\nagain, not even when she presently said good-night to him, after having\nwoke up the old mulatto woman who, with herself and her mother, were the\nonly other inhabitants of the house, and told her to make up a couple of\nmat beds in the adjoining room. Federigo had before that gone in to his\nmother, and they could be heard in eager conversation.\n\nIn Salv\u00c3\u00a9's mind a new impulse had been unexpectedly given to thoughts\nfrom which the novelty of his situation should have afforded him at\nleast a temporary relief; and he lay long awake, thinking drearily about\nElizabeth. When he did fall asleep at last, he dreamed that he had come\ninto a serpent's nest, and that he was engaged in a life and death\nconflict with a huge snake, that was thrusting its forked tongue at him\nfrom walls, from roof, from every side; and in the gleam of its\nvindictive eyes, he seemed all at once to recognise Paolina.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n\nWith a view to bring himself into harmony with his surroundings, he\nappeared next day in his suit of fine blue cloth, which he had brought\nwith him in his bundle, together with sundry other articles, and what\nmoney he had still remaining from the pay which he had received at Monte\nVideo. That he looked well in his handsome sailor dress was evident\nenough, from the surprised look with which he was greeted by Federigo's\nmother, when he was presented to her. She had evidently expected to see\nin her son's friend something in the style of the raw Brazilian sailor,\na class of men who down there were generally drawn from the lowest dregs\nof the populace.\n\nShe herself was a withered old woman, yellow as parchment, with a mass\nof thick grey hair gathered in a single knot at the back of her head.\nShe wore heavy rings on her fingers, and large earrings; her small\npiercing eyes had a look of burnt-out passion; and her countenance wore\nin a stronger degree the furtive, ratlike expression which her son's\noccasionally displayed.\n\nAs regards her further characteristics, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 soon perceived that she\nwas addicted to drink. She used to remain during the greater part of the\nday on the shady side of the house, or on the little veranda, with\nacachacas and water by her side, and incessantly smoking and rolling\ncigarettes; and she was often quite drunk as she mumbled her Ave Maria,\nand told her beads on her knees before going to bed in the evening.\nStill the other inmates of the house appeared to have great respect for\nher; and it was evident that she held the threads of whatever business\nthey might have on hand.\n\nThe se\u00c3\u00b1orita was out all the morning with the old mulatto woman, making\npurchases for the house, Federigo said, and informing herself as to what\nactivity was being shown in their pursuit. When she returned, she\navoided addressing herself directly to Salv\u00c3\u00a9; and he observed that she\nhanded over a quantity of money to her brother, which had the happy\neffect of bringing into his countenance a more cheerful look than it had\nhitherto worn that morning.\n\n\"What have you done to my sister?\" Federigo asked one day, laughing;\n\"you are not in her good graces. She is dangerous,\" he said, seriously;\nand added then, as if speculating on possibilities, \"as long as you are\nin this house, at all events, you are safe. But mind, you are warned.\"\n\nFederigo soon began to weary of their enforced confinement to the house,\nand in spite of his sister's efforts to dissuade him, began to go out in\nthe evenings, coming home very late, and in a gloomy, irritable\nhumour--evidently, from the casual remarks he let fall, having lost all\nhis money at play.\n\nThe second morning of his stay in the house Salv\u00c3\u00a9 had perceived that\nthere was a want of money; and having heard the brother and sister\nquarrelling one day when both were in a bad humour, he thought it best\nto carry out, at the first convenient moment, the determination at which\nhe had arrived, and handed over to Federigo what money he had, with the\nexception of a single silver piastre, saying, \"That it was only right he\nshould pay for his lodging and board.\"\n\nThe money, though deprecatingly, was still accepted, and in the evening\nFederigo was out once more, his sister remaining at home.\n\nShe and Salv\u00c3\u00a9, on account of their ignorance of each other's language,\ncould not hold much conversation together, and Salv\u00c3\u00a9 was rather glad of\nthis wall of separation between them, as it left him more at his ease.\nShe had, however, recently looked more often at him with a sort of\ninterest, and on several occasions had put questions to him through her\nbrother. Her range of ideas was apparently not extensive, as her\nquestions always turned upon the same topic--namely, what the women were\nlike in his country; so that he soon came to know by heart all the\nSpanish terms which related to that subject.\n\nThey were out on the veranda together that evening, and as she went past\nhis back while he was leaning over in his seat, she drew her hand as if\nby accident lightly through his hair. If it had had the electricity of a\ncat's, it would have given out a perfect shower of sparks, so enraged\nwas he at the advance.\n\nWhen Federigo came home he flung his hat away angrily on to a chair, and\ndrank down at a gulp a glass of rum that was standing on the table. He\nno longer wore the smart cloak he had on when he went out.\n\n\"I have gambled away all your money!\" he cried, in English, to Salv\u00c3\u00a9, as\nif careless of further reticence, and made some remark then with an\nunpleasant laugh to his sister, who had evidently by her expression\nperceived at once how matters stood.\n\n\"There's my last piastre for you,\" said Salv\u00c3\u00a9, throwing it over to him.\n\"Try your luck with it.\"\n\n\"He is successful in love,\" said Paolina, tearfully, and with a _na\u00c3\u00afve_\naffectation of superstition--\"he is engaged.\"\n\nWhen her brother, who was balancing the piastre on his forefinger,\nlaughingly translated what she had said, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 replied snappishly, with\nan impatient glance at the se\u00c3\u00b1orita--\n\n\"I am not engaged, and never shall be.\"\n\n\"Unsuccessful in love!\" she broke out, gleefully; \"and the last piastre!\nTo-morrow we shall win a hundred, two hundred, Federigo!\"\n\nIt was clearly the conviction of her heart; and she seized a mandolin\nand began to dance to her own accompaniment, her eyes resting as she did\nso upon Salv\u00c3\u00a9 with a peculiar expression.\n\n\"Quick, Federigo!--why not this evening?\" she cried, breaking off\nsuddenly with a laugh, and throwing the mandolin from her on to the\nsofa. \"To-morrow his luck may be gone.\"\n\nShe seized her brother's hat, crushed it down upon his head, and pushed\nhim eagerly out of the door, going with him herself to open the wicket.\n\nShe came back then to Salv\u00c3\u00a9, and as they sat _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_ in the\nlamplit room with doors and windows thrown wide open, the moonlight\ngleaming on the dark trees outside, and the night air perfumed with the\nscent of flowers, she endeavoured to ingratiate herself with him by\npouring out his rum-and-water and by rolling his cigarettes, an art in\nwhich it appeared from her laughter and gestures that she thought him\nawkward. She was in a state of feverish excitement, and kept darting off\nto the wicket and back again.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 sat and smoked, and sipped his glass unconcernedly, whilst she\nrocked herself backwards and forwards in a rocking-chair, with her head\nthrown back, and her eyes steadily fixed upon him. He heard a sigh, and\nshe said in a low, ingratiating tone--\n\n\"I am afraid Federigo is unlucky.\"\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 was not so stupid as not to comprehend her meaning. He was quite\naware that she was handsome as she sat there with her hand on her knee,\nand her well-formed foot gracefully brought into view; but his feeling\nwas exclusively one of indignation that such a common Brazilian baggage\nshould presume to bring herself into comparison with Elizabeth. He flung\naway his cigar impatiently, and went down into the garden, without\nattempting to conceal his aversion. He hated all women since the one he\nhad fixed his heart on had disappointed him, and he strode backwards and\nforwards now in more than usual indignation against the sex.\n\nHe was still pacing the garden when Federigo came back, heated and\ntriumphant, with his cloak on his shoulder and a bag under his arm.\n\n\"Nearly three hundred piastres!\" he cried, clearing the garden in a\nsuccession of bounds.\n\nHis sister had been asleep on the sofa, and sprang up in ecstasy at the\nintelligence; and they proceeded then with childish glee to spread out\nthe silver on the table, and divide it into three. When Salv\u00c3\u00a9 absolutely\nrefused to take more than his one piastre back again, there came\nactually a look of humble admiration into the se\u00c3\u00b1orita's eyes. She could\nnot comprehend such an act of self-sacrifice, although she seemed to\nvaguely feel that there was something noble about it. After a moment's\nconsideration she held out her hand and said--\n\n\"Se\u00c3\u00b1or, give me the piastre you have in your hand, and I will give you\nanother in return for it.\"\n\nHe did so, and she took it and kissed it repeatedly.\n\n\"I shall play with this one to-morrow evening,\" she cried joyfully, and\nput it into her bosom.\n\nShe carried out her intention, and came home beaming, with a whole\nbagful of piastres.\n\nIt seemed that the family lived only by play. The son, it is true, was\nin connection with one or other of the political parties of the town,\nwith the prospect of an appointment as officer in a volunteer corps if\nany rising took place; but that did not in the meantime bring in money,\nand how they managed to get along when luck went against them it was not\neasy to see.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 meanwhile was becoming rather tired of being on land. The\nseclusion had suited him well enough at first, until the se\u00c3\u00b1orita had\nbegun to pay him attentions; but now that she evidently remained at home\nall day solely on his account, to dress at him, and play off all sorts\nof coquetry upon him, he began to find it intolerable; and when the Juno\nat last had sailed, he announced one day that he meant to go down to the\nharbour and look for employment.\n\nThe se\u00c3\u00b1orita turned pale, but soon recovered her self-possession, and\neven joked with him about it; and later on her brother persuaded him to\ndefer his intention for three days, until he had attended a gathering of\nFederigo's friends, which was to take place one night down in one of the\nsuburbs.\n\nThat evening, when her brother had gone out as usual to play, the\nse\u00c3\u00b1orita sat down in the window of the room where Salv\u00c3\u00a9 was, and through\nwhich he would have to pass to go into the garden. She had undone her\nluxuriant hair, and had put on a languishing look, and every now and\nthen thrummed absently on her guitar, humming gently to herself as she\nfixed her black eyes upon him. Salv\u00c3\u00a9 saw himself in a manner besieged,\nand felt half inclined to brush past her and escape into the garden; but\nit would have seemed too deliberately unfriendly. The only sign which\nbetrayed his consciousness of the situation was the somewhat hasty way\nin which he puffed his cigarette.\n\n\"You really mean to leave us?\" she said at last sadly, in almost a\nbeseeching tone.\n\n\"Yes, se\u00c3\u00b1orita,\" was the reply, and evidently it came from the bottom of\nhis heart; he was angry, and weary of her importunity.\n\nHe had hardly said it before, thrusting her hand into her bosom, she had\nsprung to her feet, and a stiletto whizzed past his ear, and stuck\nquivering in the wall close to his head. Her supple body was still in\nmotion, her face was pale, and her eyes were flashing: then with a\nsudden transition she threw herself back and laughed.\n\n\"Were you frightened?\" she cried. But Salv\u00c3\u00a9 showed no sign of it. He was\nprovoked, but cool; and not being the kind of man who would deign to\nengage in a conflict with a woman, he left the stiletto sticking in the\nwall, though at first he had thought of seizing it.\n\n\"Look here!\" she said, suddenly darting over and drawing it out, and\nthen practising with it, laughing all the while, at various spots on the\nwalls of the room, which she hit every time to a nicety.\n\n\"You were frightened--confess that you were,\" she said, teasingly,\nsitting down opposite to him, heated with the exercise she had gone\nthrough. She gazed into his face with her cheek resting on her hand and\nher elbow on the table. \"You were afraid; and now you are angry. The\nwomen in your country don't do such things!\"\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 turned to her with a look of icy rebuff. \"No, se\u00c3\u00b1orita,\" he\nreplied, curtly, and went down into the garden.\n\nThereupon she seized the guitar again, and began strumming an\naccompaniment apparently to her thoughts. It was no longer lively music\nshe played, but something of a menacing strain, in keeping with the look\nin her eyes, and she seemed in a manner to hiss the air through her\nteeth.\n\nLater on in the evening she came tripping over to him with a coquettish\nsmile, and after the custom of the country offered him a cigarette,\nwhich she had begun to smoke herself. When he rather ungallantly\ndeclined it, she exclaimed furiously, stamping her foot--\n\n\"Se\u00c3\u00b1or!\"\n\nBut she recovered herself in a moment, and said laughing, with at all\nevents apparent good-nature, something which meant that she understood\nthat this might perhaps not be a custom in his country.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 felt much relieved when her brother came home, and told him that\nthe meeting he was waiting for was to take place on the following\nevening.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n\nIt was into a badly-lighted tavern, with two or three rooms leading out\nof one another, that his friend then conducted him. Men of the most\nvarious social positions, many with a military look, and in\nhalf-threadbare uniforms, filled the inner rooms; and in the outer one\nhe had seen upon entering a number of seafaring men, who looked like\nAmericans, and who nodded to him on the strength of his sailor's dress.\nThere were several women, more or less well dressed, moving about among\nthem, and others standing with eager faces over the gambling-table in\nthe inner room. All were drinking acachacas, and the whole place was\npervaded with a cloud of tobacco-smoke, out of which there came a\ndeafening clamour of talk.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 had a seat found for him by his friend at a long table, amongst a\nnumber of bronzed, bearded men, with large hats, leather breeches, and\nspurs, whose company he by no means cared about. They looked like\nmounted bullock-drivers, such as he had seen at Monte Video, or still\nmore, perhaps, like brigands, or banditti.\n\n\"They belong to Mendez's volunteer corps,\" whispered Federigo, as he\npresented him then to the chief of the party, who sat at the top of the\ntable--a powerful fellow, with a weather-beaten complexion, heavy black\nmustachios, and a pair of small active eyes, which, more than once\nafterwards, when Salv\u00c3\u00a9 was not looking, were turned critically upon him.\n\nEvery now and then they clinked their glasses together to some party\ntoast; but otherwise they were quiet enough at first. People of the same\ncalibre sat round other tables in the immediate neighbourhood; and at\nanother were intermingled well-dressed persons from the town, who were\ncarrying on a whispered conversation, and who appeared anxious.\n\nThe shouting, and the noise, and the laughter kept increasing. There\nwere already drunken faces at the table, and in several directions\nquarrelling and the sound of blows were beginning to be heard. Federigo,\nwho seemed to be known to many in the rooms, had mixed with the crowd,\nand Salv\u00c3\u00a9's neighbours on either side were now playing eagerly with\ndice, diving from time to time for small silver pieces into heavy\nleathern purses, that seemed to have been destined for sums very\ndifferent from what their present meagre contents represented. So many\ndebased, avaricious countenances as he saw around him he had never\nimagined that it would be possible to collect in one spot, and he made\nup his mind to have no more to do with them than he could possibly help.\nHe might congratulate himself, he thought, if he escaped from them with\na whole skin, and he felt in his breast-pocket to see that his knife was\nthere.\n\nOne of the North Americans who had nodded to him, in virtue of his\nsailor's dress, when he entered, came over to him now and asked him to\ncome and sit with them; but as he rather felt himself under Federigo's\ncharge, he declined just then. Shortly after, to his surprise, he saw\nthe se\u00c3\u00b1orita standing at the gaming-table, with her head, which was all\nhe could see, beautifully dressed; and he observed that the eyes of the\nkeeper of the tavern--a tall, lean Portuguese, with a long, sallow face,\nand hardly any hair on his head, who himself presided at the table--were\nturned towards her continually with a look of humble, tender concern.\nShe was playing excitedly, and losing every time. At last she stopped,\nin evident irritation, and beckoned him to one side, with a certain\nauthority, in spite of his having the table to attend to.\n\nThey spoke eagerly together, and Salv\u00c3\u00a9 caught a rapid glance directed\ntowards himself by the se\u00c3\u00b1orita, which he did not at all like. She was\nunnaturally pale; and he saw that she finally gave the other her hand,\nwhich he kissed with an enraptured expression, and she then disappeared\nfrom the room.\n\nThe landlord's face beamed the whole evening afterwards, and he bowed\npolitely to Federigo as he passed the table. The latter, the next time\nhe came near Salv\u00c3\u00a9, whispered rather scornfully--\n\n\"I believe my sister has bartered away her soul this evening, and\npromised to marry that old money-bag there who keeps the tavern.\nCongratulate us, _amigo mio_!\"\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 observed that the said money-bag conferred now more than once with\nthe man at the head of his own table, and was apparently making terms\nwith him; and that the latter also, when he thought he was not observed,\nglanced over at himself in a way that was very far from putting him at\nhis ease.\n\nThe American who had spoken to him before--a tall, athletic-looking man,\nwith a fair beard round a hard Yankee face, and with a remnant of gold\nlace on the sleeve of his jacket--had since been at the gaming-table,\nand had been losing one doubloon after another.\n\n\"They don't play fair, my lad!\" he cried in English to Salv\u00c3\u00a9, to whom he\nseemed anxious to make up.\n\n\"I daresay not,\" was the reply; \"it's a vile den.\"\n\n\"What country do you hail from?\"\n\n\"Norway.\"\n\n\"Ah! Norwegian. Good sailors.\"\n\n\"Deserted at Rio?\" he asked then, with a laugh, as if he expected, as a\nmatter of course, an answer in the affirmative.\n\n\"Shall I play for you?\" he asked presently.\n\n\"No money.\"\n\n\"Here's a guinea on account of your wages on board the 'Stars and\nStripes,' for Valparaiso and Chinchas!\" he cried, with a laugh that was\nheard above the surrounding din; and flinging a gold piece on the table,\nhe lost it.\n\nHe turned, and putting his hand to his mouth, shouted--\n\n\"One more on account!\" and another gold piece shared the fate of the\nfirst.\n\n\"One more on account!\" there came again, and with the same result.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 had by this time had about enough of this free-and-easy and\nundesired playing on his account. The man's face, moreover, with all its\njoviality, by no means attracted him, and he shouted to him in a\nsharply-protesting tone--\n\n\"Play for yourself, Yankee.\"\n\nThe American seemed not to be able to hear on that side, for he\nrepeated, coolly nodding to him--\n\n\"One more on account!\"\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9's patience was exhausted. He had been sitting all this time\nsqueezed up in the narrow space between the bench and the wall with\npeople on both sides of him, preventing his getting out; but now\ngrasping his neighbour violently by the shoulder, he sprang all at once\nacross the table and over to the unabashed Yankee, with an irresistible\nfeeling that, come what might, he would get out into the freedom of the\nopen air once more.\n\nJust then there came from the furthest room a cry of \"police.\" The\nlights in that room were at once extinguished; and a moment after, those\nin the room where Salv\u00c3\u00a9 was on the point of falling foul of the American\n(who, to his great surprise, found him all of a sudden confronting him)\nwent out also.\n\nTheir hostile relations, however, were almost immediately turned into\nfriendly ones. For Salv\u00c3\u00a9, who had seen the landlord making a rush\ntowards him, felt himself suddenly, in the midst of the confusion caused\nby the darkness, seized by two men and forced towards a door leading in\nanother direction than that in which he saw the stream was setting, and\nwhich no doubt was the way out.\n\n\"Help, Yankee! there's some villany on here; the small door to the\nright!\" he shouted, with great presence of mind, and at the same moment\nthe door was slammed behind him. A handkerchief was tied over his mouth;\nhe was tripped up and brought heavily to the ground, where his feet and\nhands were tied, and he was then shot into a dark side-room, which\nseemed to be at the back of a press, that was unlatched to pass him\nthrough.\n\n\"H'm!\" said the Yankee coolly, to himself. \"I am not going to lose his\npay, if I know it,\" and he set out accordingly in search of the police,\nwith whom he had no outstanding account.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 was certain he had heard the se\u00c3\u00b1orita's voice whispering in the\nouter room; and not long after he heard the latch in the press raised,\nand she stood before him with a light. She looked at him mischievously,\nand spilt some oil out of the lamp on to his face with a little scornful\nlaugh. But her expression changed then to that of a tigress burning for\nrevenge that is compelled to put off the gratification of her fury, and\nshe darted out again, clapping down the latch behind her.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 lay tightly bound with his hands behind his back. But his cat-like\nsuppleness enabled him eventually to wriggle his sheath-knife out of his\nbreast pocket, and he found no great difficulty then in freeing himself\nfrom his bonds.\n\nHe stood now with his knife in his hand and listened.\n\nBefore long he heard the American's voice, with the police, and they\nappeared to be searching. He shouted to them; and the next moment he was\nreleased.\n\n\"He is one of our crew--belongs to the Stars and Stripes,\" said the\nAmerican, arresting Salv\u00c3\u00a9, who, as long as he got out of this accursed\ntown now, did not care in what capacity it might be, and offered no\nopposition.\n\n\"You have not improved your beauty, my lad,\" said his rescuer,\nderisively, as he held up the light to his face.\n\n\"I should like to have one word with the tavern-keeper before I go,\"\nsaid Salv\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n\"And that is what we have not the slightest inclination for,\" said the\nAmerican--who, it now appeared, was boatswain on board--in a dry tone of\nauthority. \"We are not going larking with the police. Besides, having\nonce recovered that trifle of wages, I don't mean to risk losing it\nagain.\"\n\nThe Yankees made a close ring round their prisoner, and there was\nnothing for it but to follow as he was directed. A look, however, at the\nboatswain gave him to understand that that question of the wages would\nbe settled between them when they got on board.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n\nThe Stars and Stripes lay in the roads with the Union flag at her gaff.\nShe was a long, black, and, at the water-line, well-shaped vessel, with\na crew of thirty-two men; and Salv\u00c3\u00a9 was so taken with her appearance\nthat as they came alongside he silently congratulated himself on his\nluck in getting a berth in her. They were so obliging, moreover, as to\ngive him a berth to himself in a separate cabin below. But, to his\nintense indignation, no sooner had he entered it than the door was\nlatched on the outside, and when he tried to kick it open, it was\nsignified to him that during the short time they had still to be at Rio,\nhe was to remain in confinement, that they might be sure of him. The\nheat was intolerable down there; and to add to that, there was incessant\ncrying and groaning going on in the hold beside him, as if it were full\nof sick people. It was the vilest treatment he had ever been subjected\nto.\n\nThe work of taking in the cargo went on uninterruptedly the whole night,\nas if they were in a particular hurry to get out of the harbour, and\nabout noon the anchor was weighed while the contents of the last lighter\nwere being taken on board.\n\nWhen Salv\u00c3\u00a9, some hours after, was set at liberty, they were already out\nin the open sea off the mouth of the channel. The captain, the three\nmates, and several of the inferiors in command, when on deck, wore\ngold-laced caps and a kind of uniform, as on a man-of-war, and the\nofficer of the watch was armed. The crew, on the other hand, were almost\nto a man shabby, and they seemed to consist of men of every\nnationality--English, Irish, Germans, and Americans, not to mention half\na dozen negroes and mulattoes. As no one took any notice of him, he went\nabout as he pleased for a while; and presently saw, with a disagreeable\nsensation, no less than three corpses carelessly sewed up in sail-cloth\ndropped over the side of the ship that was turned from the land, without\nthe slightest ceremony. The uncomfortable feeling which this incident\nhad aroused was anything but allayed when he heard presently from a\nlittle pale cabin-boy with whom he had entered into conversation that it\nhad been successfully concealed from the harbour authorities that there\nwas yellow fever on board; that there were many more lying sick below;\nand that one of those who had just been heaved overboard, had died the\nday before in the very berth in which Salv\u00c3\u00a9 had slept that night.\n\nIn the evening he was called aft to the captain, who was standing with\nthe boatswain at his elbow. He was a spare, energetic-looking man, of\nabout forty years of age, with thick black whiskers, marked features,\nand rather hollow cheeks, and with carefully dressed, glossy hair. He\nwas smoking a handsome pipe with a long stem inlaid with\nmother-of-pearl, and took a sip from time to time from a cup of black\ncoffee that was standing on the skylight.\n\n\"What is your name?\" he asked, nodding in reply to Salv\u00c3\u00a9's salute.\n\n\"Salv\u00c3\u00a9.\"\n\n\"Salv\u00c3\u00a9,\" repeated the captain, with an English pronunciation of the\nname; \"and Norwegian?\"\n\n\"He looks too respectable for the pack he'll have to herd with,\" he\nmuttered to the boatswain.\n\n\"Able seaman?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You have had three guineas on account?\" he went on, after a couple of\npuffs to keep his pipe alight, as he looked into his ledger; \"a month's\nwages.\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Salv\u00c3\u00a9, firmly, \"I have had nothing on account,\"--and he\nproceeded then to relate the circumstances under which the supposed\npayment had been made. \"I have not been regularly engaged till this\nmoment, if I am so now; but up to this I have been treated like a dog,\nand worse.\"\n\nThe captain took no notice of his last observation, and merely said\nshortly and sternly--\n\n\"The three guineas are owing to him, boatswain Jenkins. His place will\nbe in the foretop. A steady hand will be wanted among all that rabble\nthere.\"\n\n\"Another time you'll perhaps play on your own account, and not on the\nsailors',\" he observed, turning to the boatswain; but Salv\u00c3\u00a9 caught the\nremark.\n\nWith this the conference came to an end, the boatswain's expression\nprophesying that when the opportunity offered Salv\u00c3\u00a9 should pay for his\ntriumph. He went about nursing his prominent chin, and twisting his\nyellow whiskers, and found a victim for the present in a wretched\nMulatto, who was scouring for the cook. After first correcting him\nsharply for nothing, he coolly felled him to the deck with a handspike,\nand left him lying there unable to move.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9's blood boiled at the sight; but his indignation gave way\npresently to astonishment when he saw the poor fellow get up and go on\nindefatigably with his work, after first quietly wiping his own blood\noff the saucepan. There was a limit to brutality, he thought, and in his\ndisgust he almost envied him the blow he had received.\n\nHe provided himself now from the purser with a suit of seaman's clothes\nin lieu of the rather damaged cloth ones which he wore; and the\nsailmaker gave him out hammock clothes, to be paid for out of his wages.\nHe proceeded then to hang his hammock from one of the beams between\ndecks; and while he was doing so observed another man in a canvas suit\nlike his own, similarly occupied, not far from him. He couldn't be\nmistaken--it was Federigo.\n\nThe latter had, as Salv\u00c3\u00a9 afterwards heard, been taken by the police\nduring the affair in the tavern. He had seen how Salv\u00c3\u00a9 had been rescued\nby the boatswain of the Stars and Stripes; and having managed to escape\nfrom his captors on the way to the guard-house, he had sought a similar\nrefuge.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9's indignation at his sister's baseness was still too fresh for\nFederigo's reappearance to be in any way agreeable to him, although he\nbelieved him to be innocent of any complicity in that business. At the\nsame time, the latter's conscience was apparently not entirely clear in\nthe matter, for there was a certain conscious sense of humiliation in\nhis expression, combined with something which made Salv\u00c3\u00a9 feel that he\nmust be upon his guard. Neither spoke to the other, and it might have\nbeen supposed from their bearing towards one another that they had never\nmet before.\n\nIt very soon became clear to Salv\u00c3\u00a9 that he could not have hit upon a\nmore unfortunate ship. The crew was composed of the dregs of the New\nOrleans and Charleston docks--men with every species of vice and\ndegradation stamped upon their countenances, and amongst whom every\nsecond word was some infamous oath or blasphemy. Blows with handspikes\nwere of common occurrence, and brutality and violence generally were the\norder of the day. There was no court of appeal, and the immunity which\nany one individual might enjoy depended entirely upon how far he was\nprotected by the officers--who, however, in a general way, did not\ninterfere in the quarrels forward--or had formed a league with others.\n\nThe Americans and the Irish banded together, and being the most\nnumerous, practised a shameless system of tyranny against any who could\nnot defend themselves--a miserable sickly Spaniard, who had been forced\nto work until he had actually dropped, having recently been more\nespecially the object of their attentions. Their supremacy, however, was\ncontested by a party of seven or eight tattered countrymen of the\nlatter, with one or two Portuguese, who were always ready with their\nknives, and who formed a sort of opposition. To this party Federigo had\nattached himself.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 stood alone. The Americans and Irish had at first reckoned upon\nhaving him with them, but had gradually turned against him. They had\ntaken offence at his apparent disinclination to associate with them more\nthan he could help. He seemed to think himself too good for them; and in\naddition to that, the seaman-like qualities which he displayed made them\ndislike him out of envy. But their hostility was perhaps mainly due to\nthe boatswain, who encouraged the idea among the rest of the crew that\nhe was favoured by the officers. Federigo came out now in an\nunexpectedly friendly light; and Salv\u00c3\u00a9 perceived that it was only owing\nto him that all the Portuguese were not against him also. The result was\nthat the two gradually approached such other again.\n\nThere were of course in such a collection of riff-raff, individual\nbullies whose hands were against every man, but who to some extent kept\neach other in check. The one most feared of these was a huge,\ncopper-coloured, scarred Irishman, who seemed periodically to be\npossessed by a very demon of violence, and to be actually running over\nwith bad blood. He had been in irons for some time before the vessel\narrived at Rio, for having one day sworn on deck that he would murder\nthe captain. It was with this ruffian that Salv\u00c3\u00a9 had first to measure\nhimself, the boatswain being the immediate cause.\n\nOne day when the large bell forward had rung for dinner, the boatswain\ngave an order which detained Salv\u00c3\u00a9 for some time after the others had\ntaken their places at the long table in the round-house, and when he\ncame in everything was eaten up, and he lost his dinner. The following\nday exactly the same thing happened, and he had to content himself with\nhis breakfast and supper rations for the day. He perfectly understood\nthe meaning of it. In smartness and activity he was so far beyond\ncomparison superior to any of the other foretop hands, that the\nboatswain had not been able to find any excuse for subjecting him to\npunishment: he was going to try and hit him in another way. On his\nlonely watch that night Salv\u00c3\u00a9 decided what he should do if the trick was\npractised a third time upon him. It would be better to bring things to a\ncrisis at once than have his strength gradually exhausted by continued\ninsufficiency of food.\n\nThe same order being given at the same time next day, he carried it out\nas speedily as he could, and hurried on then to the round-house, where\nthe others were already at their dinner, with a bowl of meat and soup to\nevery two men.\n\nHe sat down by the side of the Irishman, who he saw had a bowl to\nhimself.\n\n\"Put the bowl this way,\" he said, coolly.\n\nThe Irishman merely looked at him contemptuously. He was evidently\nastonished at his audacity, but went on eating composedly.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 felt that he must not be beaten.\n\n\"Life for life, Irishman,\" he cried, springing to his feet, and as the\nother also rose, giving him a blow in the face that sent him backwards\non the bench against the wall.\n\nA fierce conflict now ensued. The Irishman got up like a bleeding ox,\nand catching up a marline-spike that was hanging from the beam, gave\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 a deep wound in the cheek, the scar of which he carried his whole\nlife through. They drew their knives then; and Salv\u00c3\u00a9's coolness and\nactivity soon gave him the superiority over his furious and unwieldy\nopponent. His movements were like those of a steel spring; and pale and\nsmiling, he delivered every blow with such well-calculated effect, that\nthe affair ended with the Irishman, bleeding profusely and\nhalf-unconscious, tumbling out of the narrow doorway to save himself.\n\nThere were not a few who were glad enough that the dreaded Irishman\nshould have been worsted, and it was to this feeling Salv\u00c3\u00a9 was indebted\nfor being allowed to fight it out alone with him. He stuck his knife now\ninto the table by the side of his dish, and, looking round him, asked,\n\"Is there any one else now who would like to keep me out of my meat?\"\n\nThere was no answer.\n\n\"While I am about it,\" he continued, without noticing the blood that was\nrunning down his face and over his hands, \"I'll settle this matter once\nfor all. I have two days' rations owing to me. Very well. For the next\ntwo days I shall keep one dish to myself. I shall see then what the\nIrishman or any one else thinks of it.\"\n\nThe Irishman was confined to his hammock the whole week with\nwound-fever, and Salv\u00c3\u00a9 had for the first time won the respect of the\ncrew. He felt at the same time that he had commenced a desperate\nstruggle, and that if he was to enjoy any sort of security in this\ncompany of ruffians whom he had now set at defiance, he must take the\ngame into his own hands, and make himself at least as much feared as the\nIrishman had been. Accordingly, instead of waiting to be challenged, he\ndeliberately became the aggressor, and set himself to dispense justice\nas he pleased.\n\nThe one who, next to the Irishman, was most dreaded, was a\nbroad-shouldered mulatto, who carried on a petty system of pillage\nagainst any one that was not supported, unluckily for him, by any party;\nand Salv\u00c3\u00a9 himself had been obliged one evening to put up with having his\nhammock taken down, and the mulatto's hung in its place. He had seen him\nin several fights, and had observed his peculiar tactics; the result of\nhis observations being the conviction that the man had not the strength\nwhich he was anxious to make the others think he had. In pursuance of\nthis policy, he had picked a quarrel with him on the head of that matter\nof the hammock, and with a similarly decisive result. The mulatto\nrejoiced in the name of Januarius, and Salv\u00c3\u00a9 accordingly requested him\nto remember that there was something still owing to him for the eleven\nother months of the year. He was a cur by nature, and never seemed to\nhave the slightest desire to renew the struggle afterwards, which was\nnot the case with the Irishman, with whom Salv\u00c3\u00a9 perceived, directly the\nman came on deck again, that a fresh trial of strength was inevitable.\n\nAn opportunity was not long in offering, and Salv\u00c3\u00a9 seized it at once, so\nthat the challenge might come from him. The Irishman had taken a fancy\nto the boots of the wretched Spaniard who was ill, and was now wearing\nthem.\n\n\"Irishman,\" said Salv\u00c3\u00a9, as the other passed him, when they were lounging\nabout after dinner, \"that is an awkward pair of boots you have on there.\nIf you take my advice you'll return them to their owner, or--I shall\nhave to pull them off you.\"\n\nThe Irishman glared at him, but turned pale at the last threat; and\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9's eye seemed to light up at the prospect of carrying it out. The\nformer made the mistake of preparing to defend himself instead of taking\nthe aggressive, and in a moment was knocked down and stunned for an\ninstant by a couple of unexpected blows from Salv\u00c3\u00a9, who flew at him like\na tiger-cat. The crew gathered round. The Irishman seized a heavy iron\npump-handle as a weapon, and Salv\u00c3\u00a9 a handspike; and Salv\u00c3\u00a9 kept his word.\nHe pulled the boots off as the other lay senseless on the deck, and took\nthem down to the Spaniard.\n\nIn point of physical strength, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 was far from being the equal of\nmany of these men, who, he knew very well, were now only looking out for\nan occasion to get the better of him. His only chance was to take the\ninitiative on all occasions, and to seem the most reckless and the most\ncareless of life, and the most eager to fight of them all. He therefore\nflew at his man without hesitation on the slightest provocation, and\nwhenever he threatened took care to keep his word.\n\nThe constant strain upon his energy became at last like a fever in his\nblood, and the life he was leading began to show itself in his face. He\nhad come to be reckoned on board as one of those stubborn, unruly\nspirits that are common enough among the dregs of humanity to be met\nwith in ships' holds in that quarter of the globe, and who usually end\ntheir career at the yard-arm, or by a bullet from the captain's\nrevolver. In this very ship, before they came into Rio, at the time the\nIrishman had been put in irons, the captain had, without any hesitation,\nshot down from the yard one of the crew, whom he supposed to be the\nringleader of the mutineers. He looked upon Salv\u00c3\u00a9 now with increasing\ndistrust, wondering how he could ever have been so mistaken in a man as\nhe had been in him. \"But put a man to herd with rabble, and it's hard\nfor him not to become one of them,\" he said; and, deteriorated though he\nwas, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 was still the smartest sailor he had on board.\n\nThe boatswain kept out of his way now as much as possible, for he had\nheard that Salv\u00c3\u00a9 had sworn to tear his entrails out if he gave him any\nfresh cause for offence. The latter knew very well, though, that he was\nmeditating something against him, and was not surprised therefore at\nbeing called aft one day to stand a formal trial before the captain for\nthe expression which he had used with regard to the boatswain, and which\nhe did not affect to deny, \"as the boatswain,\" he said, \"had wished to\ntake his life.\"\n\n\"I mean to leave the ship,\" he said, \"the moment we come to Valparaiso.\nI am only engaged so far. But, indeed, I care little what becomes of\nme,\" he ended, gloomily.\n\nThe captain probably had his own notions with regard to the boatswain,\nas Salv\u00c3\u00a9 escaped the severe punishment he had expected, and was only\ncondemned to solitary confinement for fourteen days on bread-and-water.\n\n\"That will take you down a bit, my lad,\" said the captain.\n\nThe boatswain, however, made up for the leniency of his superior by a\nlittle ingenuity of his own; and every day, when Salv\u00c3\u00a9 was enjoying his\nmeagre fare in his place of confinement, the mulatto, whom he had\ntriumphed over, by the boatswain's orders, took his dinner of hot meat\nand ate it outside the door, close to the hole through which the light\nwas admitted, that the savoury smell might make its way in and tantalise\nhim.\n\nAt first, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 rather enjoyed the repose which his confinement afforded\nhim; but as his hunger increased he grew irritable, and at dinner-time\none day he approached his face to the opening.\n\n\"Mulatto!\" he began; and the other looked up and grinned with his white\nteeth, pleased to see some sign at last that his attentions had not been\nthrown away--\"that's good food you have there.\"\n\n\"Excellent,\" replied the other, mischievously, and with an inward\nchuckle.\n\n\"It makes me picture to myself your future,\" Salv\u00c3\u00a9 continued, placidly,\n\"how it will be with you when I come out again. You will be like that\nlobscouse, my friend. Had that never occurred to you?\"\n\nThe mulatto went on eating, but grew absent. His nature, as before\nobserved, was not a courageous one, and it was obvious that his food at\nlast began to stick in his throat.\n\n\"It is much the same as if you were sitting there and feeding on\nyourself,\" said Salv\u00c3\u00a9, after a longer pause, during which he had watched\nthe other's lengthening countenance. \"That's just what it will be, my\ndear friend, unless--\"\n\n\"Unless--?\" repeated the mulatto, pricking up his ears.\n\n\"Unless you take good care to pass your dinner in here to me every day\nfrom this time. There are only five days more, and I have fasted for\nnine, while you have been feeding away, so you are getting off cheaply\nenough. If the boatswain sees you passing in food to me, you'll be\npunished, so you will have to be cautious, and hold up the plate\nyourself before the opening, that he may think you are eating right in\nmy face.\"\n\nThese were humiliating terms; and the mulatto made no immediate reply.\nHe merely sat with his woolly head bent down in a thoughtful attitude.\nBut the next day he stationed his broad person with the plate in his\nhand up in front of the opening, and Salv\u00c3\u00a9 mercilessly took every morsel\nthere was on it.\n\nIt was a matter of the last importance to him not to be reduced in\nstrength, as he knew his life was in his own hands; and that he was\nanything but taken down, and was as ready as ever for a fight, he\nshowed, when he came out, in a sanguinary encounter which he engaged in\ngratuitously for Federigo with one of the Americans, and in which it\nwould otherwise undoubtedly have gone hard with the Brazilian.\n\nIt was not out of any respect for him that Salv\u00c3\u00a9 took his part. He\nlooked upon him as false, treacherous, and entirely unprincipled; there\nwas nothing he did or said that did not seem pervaded with these\ncharacteristics. But he helped him on the strength of that comradeship\nwhich among these reprobates has its inviolable laws; and further than\nthat, there was something akin to a personal friendship existing between\nthem. Federigo was decidedly interesting. He could talk more or less on\nalmost every subject, and he was full of theories which he propounded\nduring their watches together, and to which Salv\u00c3\u00a9 eagerly listened.\nThere was, he said, among other remarks, and in a superior manner, no\nsuch thing as religion, no such being as God. Such ideas were only for\ndunderheads, who, moreover, in every country had their own particular\nform of belief for the clever people and the priests to turn to their\nown purposes. In reference to that, he told many stories of the\nimpositions practised by the priests in Brazil; and had many agreeable\nanecdotes, too, about the beliefs of the wretched little race whose Sun\nland they were passing at the time. He pronounced, in a word, for the\nright of the strongest, and for piastres, women, and freedom as the\ngreat objects of existence. What other god than Salv\u00c3\u00a9, he once asked\nironically, had prevented the Irishman from taking the life of the\nmiserable Spaniard down there in the hold? or what god other than Fear\nprevented the boatswain from felling Salv\u00c3\u00a9 himself to the deck with a\nhandspike? Although Salv\u00c3\u00a9 despised the speaker, his arguments made no\nslight impression upon him. What god, he asked himself, would save him,\nif he did not take care of himself among all these ruffians who\nsurrounded him? and had there been any such controlling Power in the\nworld, he thought with bitterness, a great deal in his life would have\nbeen very different. Conversations of this kind always made him feel\nthoroughly bad.\n\n\"What do you suppose,\" he suddenly asked, one evening as they were\ntalking together on their watch, \"your sister meant to do with me,\nFederigo, if I had not escaped?\"\n\nUp to this they had avoided touching upon this tender subject, and\nFederigo answered, evasively--\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know. She takes wild notions sometimes.\"\n\n\"Yes--but what do you think? I know you had no hand in the matter.\"\n\n\"H'm! I had rather not say,\" replied Federigo, obviously relieved, but\nwith a peculiar smile, as if his fancy was ranging not without enjoyment\nthrough the region of possibilities. \"She scalded a monkey once, that\nhad bitten her, slowly to death with boiling-water. But her ingenuity\nwas endless.\"\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 felt a shudder run through him, and something in his face told the\nother that he had better not indulge his fancy any further; and he\nhastened, therefore, to add half in joke and half by way of\nconsolation--\n\n\"Poor Antonio Varez will pay for her having been obliged to marry him,\nnever fear. Yes, she is rich and happy,\" he concluded with a sigh, as if\nhe envied her; and the subject dropped.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n\nThey doubled Cape Horn, and came to Valparaiso. But, on the morning they\nwere to enter the harbour, Salv\u00c3\u00a9, to his intense exasperation, was put\nunder arrest. The captain found him too useful in keeping the crew in\norder forward, and therefore took the most effectual means of preventing\nhim from putting into execution his declared determination to leave the\nship on their arrival at that port.\n\nAfter leaving Valparaiso they called at the Chincha Islands, took in a\ncargo of guano for China, and shaped their course then eastward across\nthe calm southern ocean, whose lonely monotony was only broken by the\noccasional appearance of one of the larger kind of sea-birds, or by the\ndistant spouting of a whale. On board, however, the same peace was far\nfrom prevailing. That little nut-shell that crept like a dot across the\nlimitless expanse of waters was a little floating hell, where every evil\npassion raged from morning until night; and it was only by secretly\nfomenting discord and divisions among the crew that the officers could\nsleep with any sense of security in their berths. As it was, a large\nsection of them, with the Irishman at their head, had a project on hand\nfor murdering their officers, and converting the ship into a whaling\nvessel. And even Salv\u00c3\u00a9, in moments of bitterness and indignation at the\ntyranny to which he was subjected by these men, whose lives were at the\nmercy of the crew, would sometimes entertain the thought of joining with\nthe mutineers, who were restrained from carrying out their designs\nmainly by the fear which he had inspired, and by the refusal of his\nsanction. Many a desperate struggle with himself he went through when\none of his tyrants passed him on deck in the dark, and the temptation to\nstick a knife into his back would rise strong within him, and almost\nmaster him. The other's life hung upon a hair, and Salv\u00c3\u00a9 knew it; but\nthat hair was stronger than he thought. Elizabeth's face, and the still\nunexhausted might of early impressions, made him always shrink from the\nthought of having a murder on his conscience, and to that depth he never\nfell, deteriorated though his character gradually became, from daily\nassociation with everything that was vile, to that degree that he lost\nall power of believing in the existence of good amongst his\nfellow-creatures, or in a higher Power.\n\nWe need follow no further this dark period of his life. After a year and\na half on board the Stars and Stripes, and many a wild scene of\nturbulence and riot, he brought his connection with her to a close at\nlast at New Orleans, where the accumulation of his wages was handed over\nto him.\n\nThe life on board the other vessels in which he afterwards served did\nnot differ greatly from that which he had left; but he had become\naccustomed to it, and his sensibilities were blunted by long habit. It\nwas not until some four years had thus passed that he again began to\nfeel a longing for Europe--he would not acknowledge to himself that it\nwas Norway exactly that he wanted to see again;--and after looking out\nthen for some time for a suitable ship for the home voyage, he found\nhimself at last with his Brazilian friend on board a large barque that\nwas homeward bound from Cura\u00c3\u00a7oa, with tobacco and rum, for Rotterdam and\nNieuwediep.\n\nFederigo had been his inseparable companion through all the vicissitudes\nof his southern life; the secret of his faithful attachment, as Salv\u00c3\u00a9\nsuspected, being that the latter had saved money, which he had turned\ninto gold pieces and kept in a belt round his waist. He had never, like\nFederigo, sought occasions to squander his pay on land in gambling or in\nother diversions. He hated women; and in the taverns which were\nfrequented by sailors he was looked upon as a dangerous customer, to\nwhom it was prudent to give as wide a berth as possible. Federigo, he\nfancied, looked upon him as his reserve cash-box; and when on one\noccasion, after they came into port, the Brazilian proposed that they\nshould desert and put their money into some mines that were very\nfavourably reported of just then, and share the profits, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 remarked\nwith perfect composure that he thought it highly probable that if they\nstarted upon any expedition of the kind, his friend, if he got him alone\nsome fine night in a lonely place, would quietly stick his knife into\nhim and make off with the whole. He therefore declined the proposition,\nbut their relations nevertheless continued as friendly as before. Money\nwas the only power, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 reflected with bitterness, and this\nsatisfaction at least he could now enjoy in life.\n\nIt had become so obvious to him that Federigo's attachment was more to\nhis money than to himself, that he determined to get rid of his irksome\nattentions. Accordingly, when they arrived at Nieuwediep, he made all\nhis arrangements for leaving the vessel, legally this time, without\nsaying a word to him of his intention; and Federigo only heard of it at\nthe last moment when he met him coming up with his hammock clothes. He\nturned pale, and tears came into his eyes,--whether from a feeling of\ninjured friendship, or from disappointment, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 could not quite make\nout. The expression of his face, with his restless small black eyes,\nresembled that of a disturbed rat. At last he fell on Salv\u00c3\u00a9's neck in\nhis impetuous way, and broke out--\n\n\"But at any rate we must have one parting glass together this evening. I\ndon't know how I shall ever do without you--it is so long now since we\ntwo have chummed together.\"\n\nAgainst his better reason Salv\u00c3\u00a9 allowed himself to feel a little\nsoftened at the thought; and the remembrance of all the attachment this\nscoundrel had shown for him aroused something that almost resembled\nemotion.\n\n\"It is no use, my friend,\" he replied; \"what is done can't be undone.\nBut I'll give you this evening, at all events. You'll find me waiting\nfor you in the Aurora.\"\n\nAs usual at this season of the year, there were a great many vessels in\nthe harbour, and the Aurora tavern was full that evening of seafaring\nfolk laughing and talking and singing, and renewing, or laying the\nfoundations of, acquaintanceships over brandy or gin; while in the\nlittle room over the bar, dance music was going on uninterruptedly, and\nthe boards were creaking under alternate Dutch schottische and English\nhornpipe.\n\nTo properly appreciate a genuine sailors' reel or hornpipe, one should\nsee it danced by men who for a whole year at a time have been battling\nwith the waves and storms in every corner of the world, and who during\nall that time have hardly set eyes upon a female form. They come on\nshore bursting with a full masculine longing for the society of the\nother sex, with a year's stored-up feeling to let out; and there is a\npositive intoxication to them in the mere dance--in the mere holding at\nNieuwediep Anniken or Bibecke, or at Portsmouth Mary Ann, by the waist;\nand Mary Ann and Bibecke perfectly understand this, and for the moment\nfeel themselves persons of no small importance. There is no element of\ncoarseness in the feeling. The sailor is more given to sentiment proper\nthan perhaps any other class of men, and generally speaking a more\nromantic feeling for woman is cherished on board ship than anywhere else\nin the world. If we wish to find in these times quietly romantic\nenthusiasm, we must be the companion of the sailor on his lonely watch,\nor listen to him as he lies on the forecastle and talks with _na\u00c3\u00afve_\nsimplicity about his wife or his sweetheart--how their attachment came\nabout, and what he means to buy for her when he gets into port. Love on\nboard ship is a more naturally rich and varying theme than it is in the\npeasant's monotonous life; and being in love, by reason of separation\nfrom the object of his love, is a different thing to the sailor, a\nsomething more entirely of the heart and the imagination, which does not\nlose its ideal hue in the wear and tear of everyday use. A married\nsailor is always an object of quiet respect to his comrades who have not\nhad means to take the same step themselves; and without exaggeration it\nmay be said that woman is present in her truest sense in the midst of\nthe often outwardly rough life on board ship--warm, loving, and\nvenerated, and surrounded by all the enchantment which distance can\nsupply. If we are tempted to think otherwise, we have not penetrated to\nthe simple, childlike nature which underlies the sailor's rough\nexterior.\n\nThe exteriors, indeed, in the dancing-room of the Aurora that evening\nwere rough enough. Through the cloud of steam and tobacco-smoke, men of\nthe most various physiognomies were to be seen, the majority tanned and\nbearded, with their hats on the back of their heads, and short clay\npipes in their mouths, and all in the wildest state of enjoyment,\ndripping with perspiration and dancing indefatigably. There were French\nand Swedish sailors in their red woollen shirts, Norwegians and Danes in\nblue, with white canvas trousers, Yankees and English all in blue; and\nas they swung the gracefully dressed Dutch girls with their small white\ncaps and little capes, and petticoats fastened up to do justice to the\nneat shoes and white stockings below, vying with each other who should\ndance the best and longest, the foundation of many a friendship or\nenmity was laid, to be prosecuted later on in the evening over a bottle\nof brandy or in a stand-up fight.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 and Federigo were sitting over their gin in a side-room which\nopened into the dancing-room, and was filled with men talking and\ndrinking, or with couples who came in to rest for a moment. Neither took\npart in the dancing. Salv\u00c3\u00a9 was gloomy and out of tune for pleasure,\nalthough, for Federigo's sake, he made his humour as little apparent as\npossible. Federigo looked very disconsolate, and during the early part\nof the evening sat and sipped his glass abstractedly. But as the time\nwore on he kept filling Salv\u00c3\u00a9's glass unconsciously as it were, and\ngetting apparently more and more drunk himself, until he several times\nspilt the contents of his own glass on the floor. He became very\ntalkative, recalling incident after incident of their life together. \"I\nshall never forget you,\" he cried, with open-hearted impulsiveness,\n\"never!\" And as he repeated the word, there was a gleam of suppressed\nfeeling of some kind or other in his eye.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9's attention was preoccupied at the moment. He had heard two voices\nspeaking Norwegian by the window at his back, and it made his heart\nknock against his ribs--it was so long since he had heard his\nmother-tongue. They were two men belonging to timber ships, and one of\nthem, very red and excited, was singing the praises of one of the girls\nin the other room.\n\n\"Ah!\" broke in the other, a Tonsberger, \"you should have seen handsome\nElizabeth in 'The Star' at Amsterdam. But she wasn't for such as you to\ndance with, my lad.\"\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9's interest was awakened at once. He listened with strained\nattention for what might come next.\n\n\"And why not?\" asked the other, a little on his dignity.\n\n\"Well, in the first place, they don't dance there; and in the next, you\nwould want to be a skipper at least to pay court in that quarter, mind\nyou. I saw her in the spring of last year, when we were lying there with\nthe Galatea; she was talking to the captain, for she's Norwegian--and a\nproud one she is, too; with hair like a crown of gold on her head, and\nso straight rigged that it makes a man nervous to come alongside her.\"\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 sat rapt in thought, and more absent than was polite to his friend\nfor the rest of the evening. An idea that it might be Elizabeth had shot\nthrough him, and he could not divest himself of it, although the more he\nreflected the more certain he knew he ought to be that she had been\nmarried long ago to young Beck. His mind was in a ferment, and a wild\nlonging now possessed him to get home to Arendal and find out for\ncertain how matters actually stood.\n\nWhen the time came for breaking up, Federigo was drunk, and Salv\u00c3\u00a9 was\nobliged to accompany his inconsolable friend in the darkness over the\nlong narrow dam down by the dock, where there was water on both sides,\nFederigo clinging to his arm the whole way, and leaning heavily upon it.\n\nWhen they had reached the middle of the dam, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 saw him make a sudden\nmovement, and almost at the same moment he received a thrust in the\nregion of the heart, of such force that he staggered two or three steps\nbackwards. At the same time he heard Federigo say, in a voice trembling\nwith vindictive passion--\n\n\"Take that for Paolina, you hound!\"\n\nThe object of his cupidity, the belt of money, had saved Salv\u00c3\u00a9, who now\nfelled him to the ground with a blow that sent him rolling over the\nembankment into the sea.\n\n\"Help! help!\" came up to him from the water.\n\n\"You shall have it,\" replied Salv\u00c3\u00a9, derisively, \"for our fine\nfriendship's sake. Throw up your knife, though, first;\" and he made a\nnoose in his handkerchief then to reach down to him. \"You and your owl\nof a sister,\" he muttered as he did so, \"have taught me a thing or two.\nI should only have had exactly what I deserved if I had been both stuck\nand plundered, after being fool enough to put faith for one moment in\nyou or any one else.\"\n\n\"Now, up with you!\"\n\nWhen he saw Federigo's form scrambling up over the edge, he said,\nscornfully, \"Now then, at last we part. Good-bye, my old and faithful\nfriend!\"\n\nWith that he went his way, and heard the Brazilian screaming and\nstamping with rage down on the dam behind him in the dark.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n\nAn opportunity offered almost immediately for taking a passage home with\nthe Tonsberger before alluded to, and Salv\u00c3\u00a9 gladly availed himself of\nit, calculating upon being taken off by one of the pilot boats off the\ncoast of Arendal.\n\nIt was with a strange deep feeling that he once more trod the deck of a\nhome vessel, and as he went about and listened to the people's talk,\nfelt himself an object for their curiosity. The southern brown of his\nface, the foreign cut of his clothes, and his whole exterior, marked him\nas coming from a much higher condition of sailor life than any with\nwhich they were acquainted, and he passed for an Englishman or an\nAmerican; for he purposely avoided being recognised by them as a\ncountryman, and had made his agreement with the skipper in English.\n\nIt was certainly a long time since he had been on board a craft so\nmiserably found in every way as this leaky old galliot was. She had been\nbought by auction for a small sum at F\u00c3\u00a6rder; and in shape resembled an\nold wooden shoe, in which her skipper venturesomely trudged across to\nHolland through the spring and winter storms, calculating that he and\nhis crew could always lash themselves to something to avoid being washed\noverboard; that their timber cargo would keep them afloat; and that as\nlong as the rigging held they could sail. He carried no\ntop-gallant-mast, so as not to strain her; her sails were all in holes,\nas if they had been riddled with bullets; and where ropes had broken in\nthe rigging, they had been tied in clumsy knots, instead of being\nspliced in proper sailor-like fashion. There was not much to boast of in\nthe way of navigation either; the captain keeping his log by the simple\nmethod of spitting over the side, or throwing a chip of wood overboard,\nand making his calculations according to the pace it drifted past. The\nfood, too, was on a par with all the rest, and the cook could be heard\nbeating the dried fish with the back of an axe to make it tender. Salv\u00c3\u00a9\nseemed to have dropped all at once into home life and ways again.\n\nThe crew were dressed in thick winter clothing, and had the appearance\nof navvies rather than of sailors, but they were all fearless,\nhardy-looking fellows, as most of the men who risk their lives on these\ntimber vessels are; and what immediately struck him with a feeling of\npleasure, was the honest expression which every countenance, without\nexception, wore. It was long since he had seen a sight of the kind, and\nhe felt ashamed of himself for going about with his knife ready to hand,\nas had been his custom for so many years, and put it away in his chest\nthe very first day. He took a pleasure in leaving his watch and money\nout on the top where they might easily have been taken, and was filled\nwith surprise and admiration when he found that they were not stirred.\n\nHe had not been able to get out of his head the idea that Elizabeth was\nnow in Amsterdam, in spite of the almost certain feeling which he had\nthat she had been long ago married to young Beck. His thoughts kept\nreturning to, and dwelling upon, this subject, and he began to sound the\nskipper as to whether the trade with Holland was a paying one, and to\npost himself up generally in all particulars. Their conversation was\ncarried on in a kind of jumble of English chiefly, and he gathered, at\nall events, that it was a lucrative business, and an occupation which\nseemed likely to suit him in every way. It was adventurous, and that was\na recommendation; and a way of living at home in which he would be under\nnobody's orders but his own, fell in exactly with his nature. He had\nmore than money enough to purchase some old craft or other, and--in\nfact, it was decided; he would be the owner of a timber ship, and ply to\nHolland.\n\nHe began now to look out more impatiently than ever for land, and longed\nso to catch the first streak of the Norwegian coast above the horizon,\nas if it was something he hardly dared hope that he should live to see.\nHe paced up and down for hours together, anathematising through his\nteeth the old tub with her slack sails and rolling motion--they seemed\nto be drifting, not sailing; and from the restlessness and impatience he\nexhibited, it began to be whispered among the crew that the Englishman\nmust have a screw loose somewhere. When the dim outline of Lindesnaes\nbecame discernible at last in the far distance, there was not a\npalm-clad promontory in all the southern seas that could compare with\nit, he thought; and the pleasure he experienced was only dashed by the\napprehension of what he might have to learn about Elizabeth on landing.\n\nThey were hailed shortly after by a pilot boat from Arendal, and he\narrived there after dark the same evening, and went to Madam Gjers's\nunpretending lodging-house until the morning.\n\nThe following day was Sunday. And as he listened to the bells ringing,\nand watched the townspeople, great and small, going decorously up the\nstreet in their best clothes to church--most of them he recognised, and\namong them Elizabeth's old aunt going up by herself, with her psalm-book\nand her white folded handkerchief in her hand--an indescribable feeling\ncame over him, and his eyes filled so that he could hardly see. Here\npassing before him were all the gentleness and the purity that he had\nonce believed in, when his young faith had as yet received no shock, and\nwhen he was as joyous and credulous as the rest; and he could not resist\nthe temptation of joining the stream, trusting to the alteration in his\nappearance to save him from recognition.\n\nBeside him, almost, there walked a respectable family--he knew well who\nthey were--with a couple of handsome daughters, in light dresses, who\nhad grown up since he last saw them, and a younger brother whom he did\nnot remember. The foreign, black-bearded sailor, with his fine cloth\nclothes, and his patent gold watch-chain, seemed to excite their\ncuriosity; while he on his side was thinking how they would fly from\nhim, as if a wolf had suddenly appeared in their midst, if they had any\nconception of the life that he had been leading for years, half-a-day of\nwhich would have filled them with more horror than they had ever\nimagined. They would not understand it if it was described to them, and\nthe description would be too foul for their ears. As he quietly followed\nthe stream up the hill, it seemed as if all the sunny houses in his\nbeautiful native town were crying out against him, and asking whether it\nwas possible that a man from the Stars and Stripes could be permitted to\ngo to church as well as other people; and on entering the building he\nhad to summon up all his self-command--he had a feeling that he was\nviolating the sanctity of the place.\n\nHe took his seat in the last pew close to the door, and watched the\npeople passing up the aisle. It was like a dream; they all seemed\ncreatures of a purer world than his. The organ commenced to play, the\nsinging was begun, and he leaned his head forward on his hands,\ncompletely overcome, and trying to conceal his sobs. In this position he\nremained during the greater part of the service, his past life coming\nup, scene by scene, before him. What a gulf he felt there was between\nthe present condition of his mind and what it had been in the days when\nas a boy or lad he had gone to church like the rest. He had been\nfamiliar with more murder and blasphemy than the whole congregation\ntogether could conceive; and the simple faith he had once possessed he\nhad been robbed of, he feared irrecoverably. His eyes flashed then with\na sudden wildness as he thought who it was that had brought him to this;\nand it was with a deep hatred in his heart to one of the two at least,\nthat he left the church. In a couple who were coming out at the same\ntime, he recognised Captain Beck and his wife, and the sight added fuel\nto the flames. He hastened on; and was hardly to be recognised as the\nsame man who had gone up the same way so quietly two hours before.\n\nHe had meant to go over at once to Sandvigen to see his father, but he\nthought that before going it would be as well to find out for certain\nall about Elizabeth; and his landlady seemed as likely a person to be\nable to satisfy him as any one. He remembered well that sharp,\nbright-eyed little woman, and knew that she was a regular magpie for\nchatter, and for repeating the gossip of the town.\n\nAt that time of the day on Sunday there were no other customers in the\nhouse, and while she was busying herself with preparations for his\ndinner, he asked casually if Captain Beck's son, the one in the navy,\nwas married?\n\n\"To be sure he is,\" she replied, surprised to hear him speak Norwegian.\n\"He has been married for--let me see--about three years.\"\n\nShe looked fixedly at him.\n\n\"But who are you?\" she asked; and then, as if the thought had suddenly\nflashed upon her, she said, \"It's never Salv\u00c3\u00a9 Kristiansen, who--\" She\nstopped here, and Salv\u00c3\u00a9 dryly finished the sentence for her--\n\n\"Who deserted from Beck at Rio?--the same.\"\n\nMadam Gjers was agog with curiosity, and whispered, \"I'll say\nnothing--you may trust me;\" and waited eagerly then for further\nparticulars which she might take the first opportunity of retailing.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 assured her that he knew of old that a secret was always safe with\nher, and resumed then absently--\n\n\"So the lieutenant is married?\"\n\n\"This long while,\" she replied. \"The wedding was at the house of the\nbride's parents; and they are living now at Frederiksv\u00c3\u00a6rn.\"\n\n\"Elizabeth had no parents,\" said Salv\u00c3\u00a9, rather impatiently.\n\n\"Elizabeth?--oh! you mean the girl the Becks took to live with them.\nThat is quite another story,\" she said, significantly. \"No, the\nlieutenant's wife was Postmaster Forstberg's daughter. The other was\njust a passing fancy--the end of it was that she had to go to Holland,\npoor thing! It was said she had got a place there.\"\n\n\"Do you know anything for certain of this?\" asked Salv\u00c3\u00a9, severely, and\nwith an earnestness that put the little madam out of countenance, and\nmade her be careful of her words.\n\n\"It was all done very secretly, that's true,\" she replied. \"But she went\naway in the greatest possible hurry, and the affair was well enough\nknown, more's the pity--known and forgotten now, one may say.\"\n\n\"What was known?\" asked Salv\u00c3\u00a9, catching her up, angrily. \"Did you see\nher, Madam Gjers?\"\n\n\"Not I, indeed, nor no one else neither. The Becks were living out at\nTrom\u00c3\u00b6 at the time; and there was just very good reason for--\"\n\n\"Then neither you nor any one else who wants to take away her character\nknow a jot more about the business than what you have chosen to invent,\"\nsaid Salv\u00c3\u00a9, fiercely and contemptuously; for although he had slain\nElizabeth himself in his heart, he must still defend her against the\nattacks of others. He felt quite sick and faint.\n\n\"I happen to know the rights of the case,\" he said, with a short laugh,\nlooking her coldly and sharply in the face, \"and--\" he sprang up\nsuddenly here, and striking the table violently with his fist--\"and I\ndon't taste another morsel in such a scandal-mongering house,\" he cried.\n\"Do you understand, madam? Be good enough to take what is owing to you\nout of that,\" and flinging down a handful of silver on to the table, he\nsprang over it, and proceeded to drag his chest down-stairs himself.\n\nMadam Gjers exhausted herself in a flood of deprecation, the gist of\nwhich was that she had only said and believed what she had heard from\nevery creature in the town; but Salv\u00c3\u00a9 was unappeasable, and slinging his\nchest over his back with a rope, he went down with it to the quay, with\nthe intention of chartering a boat to take him over to his father. For\nthe present, however, he remained sitting upon the chest, gazing out\nabstractedly over the harbour.\n\nThe result of his reflections was that he gave up his idea of plying to\nHolland.\n\nHe took a boat to Sandvigen, but while they were on the way, he suddenly\nmade the boatman change his course, and put in to the slip on the other\nside of the harbour. He must talk to Elizabeth's aunt. There was\nsomething in his mind all the time that wouldn't let him altogether\nbelieve the worst.\n\nWhen he went in to the old woman, she recognised him at once.\n\n\"How do you do, Salv\u00c3\u00a9?\" she said, quite calmly. \"You have been a long\nwhile away--half a century almost.\"\n\nShe offered him a chair, but he remained standing, and asked abruptly--\n\n\"Is it true that Elizabeth--left Beck's like that--and went to Holland?\"\n\n\"How do you mean like that?\" she asked, sharply, while her face flushed\nslightly.\n\n\"As people say,\" replied Salv\u00c3\u00a9, with bitter emphasis.\n\n\"When people say it, a fool like you of course must believe it,\" she\nrejoined, derisively. \"I don't understand why you want to come here to\nher old aunt for information when it seems you have so many other\nconfidants about the town. But anyhow, she can tell you something\ndifferent from them, my lad; and she wouldn't do it, if it wasn't that\nshe knew the girl still loved you in spite of all the years you have\nbeen away, gadding about, God knows where, in the world. It's true\nenough she left Beck's one night and came here in the morning; but it\nwas just for your sake, and no one else's, that she might get quit of\nthe lieutenant. It was Madam Beck herself that got her a place in\nHolland, because she didn't want to have her for a daughter-in-law.\"\n\nA wild gleam of joy broke over Salv\u00c3\u00a9's features for a moment, but they\nrelapsed almost immediately into gloom.\n\n\"Was she not engaged to Carl Beck, then?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes and no,\" replied the old woman, cautiously, not wishing to depart a\nhair's-breadth from the truth. \"She allowed herself to be betrayed into\nsaying 'yes,' but fled from the house because she didn't want to have\nhim. She told me, with tears in her eyes, that she repented having said\n'no' to you.\"\n\n\"So that was the way of it,\" he rejoined sarcastically. \"The 'yes' and\n'no' meant that the Becks wouldn't have her for a daughter-in-law, and\nbundled her out of the house over to Holland; and you want me to believe\nit was for my sake she went. God knows,\" he added, sadly, and shaking\nhis head slowly, \"I would willingly believe it--more willingly than I\ncan say; but I can't, Mother Kirstine. You are her aunt, and want of\ncourse to--\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it is your misfortune, Salv\u00c3\u00a9,\" she broke in severely, \"not\nto have it in your power to believe thoroughly in any one creature upon\nthis earth; you'll be always doubting, always listening to folks' talk.\nWith the thoughts you have now in your mind, you have at any rate no\nbusiness any longer inside my door. But there is one thing I'll ask of\nyou,\" she said, with a look of mildly impressive earnestness in her\nstrong, clever face. \"I know Elizabeth's nature well, and don't you\nattempt to approach her or try to win her as long as you have a trace of\nthose doubts about her in your heart--it would only bring unhappiness to\nboth of you.\"\n\nHe looked dejected; and as he said good-bye to her, offered to take her\nhand. But she would not give it to him, and merely added instead--\n\n\"Remember that it is an old woman who has seen a good deal in the world\nwho tells you this.\"\n\nHe went away then; and while he was being rowed across to Sandvigen he\nchanged his mind again, and determined that his plan of plying to\nHolland should be carried out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n\nSkipper Garvloit, into whose family Elizabeth had come, occupied one of\nthe many-storeyed houses, with green window-shutters, narrow\nentrance-doors, and polished brass knockers, after the usual Dutch\nfashion, in the lively street leading down to the dock in Amsterdam,\nwith the canal on the other side, with its various bridges, and vessels\nand barges of all kinds unlading, running up from it into the heart of\nthe town.\n\nMadam Garvloit had four young children, and was not very strong, so that\nElizabeth's robust, healthy nature had been a perfect godsend to her in\nthe house, and she was content to overlook her occasional shortcomings\nof manner or temper in consideration of the assistance which she\nrendered in every department of the housekeeping.\n\nElizabeth had always had a pretty strong will of her own; and here,\nwhere she virtually had the control of everything, her tendency to\nself-assertion had been considerably developed. The force and decision\nwith which she gave her opinion about everything seemed to Madam\nGarvloit sometimes (although she said nothing) rather like a reversing\nof their relative positions; and on days when she was in a captious\nhumour--and those were her days of most feverish activity--she would\neven go so far as to set aside her mistress's orders altogether. In a\ngeneral way her moods were very uncertain: one day she would be in\ntearing spirits, racing up and down the stairs with the children, as if\nshe had been inhaling the wild air of Torungen again; and another she\nwould be so pensive and taciturn that they thought she must be pining\nafter home.\n\nShe had many admirers, both among young and old, her gay moods\nattracting the former, and her serious ones the latter. Among the former\nwere two young gentlemen acquaintances of the house, relatives of\nGarvloit--one a smart young clerk from one of the larger counting-houses\nin the town, who rather affected the gentleman; and the other a\nlight-haired, pink-complexioned, skipper's son from Vlieland. They both\ncame regularly every Sunday, were frantically jealous of one another,\ntried to outbid each other whenever an opportunity offered, and were\nboth fully convinced that they sighed in vain. She was so different,\nthey felt, from the other specimens of femininity of their acquaintance\nto whom their weak attentions had sometimes proved acceptable. There was\nsomething almost imperious in Elizabeth's manner at times that made them\nfeel quite small beside her; and however careless she might be of the\n_convenances_ in her way of speaking to them, they had very soon found\nthat wherever she chose to draw the line, so far could they go and no\nfarther.\n\nMadame Garvloit would take her to task sometimes for the scant courtesy\nwith which she treated the young clerk. Elizabeth would answer that he\nbored her; and Madame Garvloit would insist that a young girl ought to\nhave tact enough not to make this evident. Elizabeth, however, was not\ndeficient in tact, but disliked putting a restraint upon her feelings;\nand it seemed to her on the whole unreasonable that a person should\npretend that a thing was pleasant when in reality it was wearisome.\n\nDuring the second autumn of her service with the Garvloits, the skipper,\non his return from a trip to Norway, brought the intelligence that\nLieutenant Beck was engaged to Postmaster Forstberg's daughter in\nArendal, and he had many messages for Elizabeth from the latter. They\nwere to be married in the spring.\n\nElizabeth was overjoyed to hear it, for the thought had often weighed\nheavily on her mind that Carl Beck might be making himself miserable on\nher account. She judged so from her own feeling for Salv\u00c3\u00a9: and as she\nsat alone by her window at bedtime that night, gazing out over the canal\nand the shipping in the calm moonlight, the quiet afterglow of a holiday\nevening seemed to have shed itself over her thoughts. She knew from her\nfriend's message that she was ignorant of what had passed between\nherself and Carl Beck; and although it was a relief to think that he had\nnot taken his disappointment more to heart, the smile that played about\nher lips for a moment showed at the same time that his love had been\nduly appraised. As the shadow, then, of the window-frame in the\nmoonlight, crept slowly over the wall above her bed, her thoughts glided\noff in the direction they loved best to take--over the world and far\naway to Salv\u00c3\u00a9.\n\nShe sat with her heavy hair falling loose over her well-shaped\nshoulders, and her face grew more and more sorrowful in its absent\nexpression, and would twitch occasionally with pain. The bitter thought\nwould recur that it was she who was the cause of Salv\u00c3\u00a9's going out into\nthe world and becoming a desperate man. The thought haunted her; and\nyet, much as she wished to free herself from it, she found a pleasure in\ndwelling on it. She saw him, in fancy, miserable and proud, with his\npale face and keen, clever eyes fixed upon her in hatred, as the cause\nof his unhappiness, and then the idea occurred to her to put on sailor's\nclothes and go and seek him out in the world. But if she were to find\nhim, she knew, on the other hand, that for very shame she dared not show\nherself before him, having as good as belonged to another; and she would\nnot for all the world read her hard dismissal in his eye. She laid her\nhead upon her arms on the window-sill and sobbed convulsively, until at\nlength she dropped off to sleep where she sat.\n\nShe had been three years in the Garvloits' house when Garvloit had the\nmisfortune to run his vessel aground out near Amland, where she became a\nwreck. He lost with her nearly all he had in the world, and what was\nworse, all prospect of livelihood for the future as skipper.\n\nAn uncomfortable feeling prevailed now in the house, and Elizabeth saw\nwith regret that she would have to leave. Garvloit, who in figure\nresembled some thick, short-legged animal of the sea, a seal or walrus\ncome on land, had become perceptibly reduced in flesh, and went about\nall day long in his shirtsleeves, fanning himself with a large silk\npocket-handkerchief. On one particular afternoon it was observed that he\nindulged in this exercise with more than his usual vigour and\nrestlessness; and it was not without cause. He had had an inspiration.\nIf he could no longer follow his old trade, he would try a new one; he\nwould set up a house of entertainment for sailors. His house being so\nclose to the dock, could not be more favourably situated for the\npurpose, and they had ample accommodation. On the ground floor they\ncould have a room for common sailors, and on the floor above they had\none where captains and mates could be served.\n\nHe said nothing about it, however, to any one until the scheme had been\nfully matured; and then all of a sudden one day he came into the room\nwhere his wife was, with a bundle of printed placards and a large board\nin his hand.\n\n\"Good gracious, Garvloit, what is that?\" she cried.\n\nHe turned the board round with an important air, and without saying a\nword. Upon it there stood in large gilt letters, \"The Star.\"\n\n\"This is our new means of earning our bread, wife,\" he said. \"Next month\nthis sign hangs over our door, and these bills are to post on the walls,\nand distribute among the ships down in the harbour. Garvloit is not on\nhis beam-ends yet,\" he concluded, with self-conscious satisfaction; and\nproceeded then to explain how he intended to be landlord himself, and\nhow Elizabeth was to help him in the management of the whole.\n\nMadam Garvloit only made one slight objection--\n\n\"You know that you can't drink ale, my friend.\"\n\nAnother objection, namely, what they would say at home in Norway when\nthey heard that her husband had sunk into a mere tavern-keeper, she very\nwisely kept to herself. The important point was that they should find a\nway of living, and they had at all events the great consolation that now\nthey would be able to keep Elizabeth. What feeling of pride still\nremained she got rid of in telling Elizabeth that at home they knew\nnothing of millionaires in wooden shoes such as were to be found in\nHolland; and her husband found her much more keen for his project than\nhe had expected. Being accustomed to place great reliance upon her\nstronger understanding, he would not have been happy if she had been\nagainst the plan.\n\nThus it came about, then, that in the crowded street by the canal one\nMonday morning there appeared over one of the entrance-doors a\nsign-board with \"The Star,\" in letters of gold on a blue ground. It was\nset up at a fortunate time and in a fortunate place, and almost as soon\nas the house was opened, customers from the vessels in the harbour began\nto gather in, both into the down-stairs and up-stairs rooms, so that\nthere was a prospect of a steadily increasing traffic. Garvloit\ngenerally presided himself in the bar behind the counter, at the lower\nend of which there stood an array of stone mugs with tin lids; while in\na recess of the wall there stuck out from beside canisters of tobacco,\nlong and short Dutch clay pipes, a new one filled being handed to every\ncustomer, with whatever drink he ordered. Out of sight under the counter\nwhere the stone mugs stood was the ale-barrel, with its bright tap over\na vessel that caught the drip; and after the same cleanly Dutch fashion,\nspittoons filled with sand stood in every corner of the room. The\nshelves above were filled in rows with a regular apothecary's shop of\nbottles and jars of spirits, and among them a goodly array of\nsecurely-fastened, dark-green flasks of Dutch hollands.\n\nElizabeth had as housekeeper quite as much as she could do, and did not\ndirectly busy herself with waiting, unless there was something\nparticular required to be done for the up-stairs customers.\nOccasionally, however, she would come into the bar also, on some errand\nor another, or to make sure that nothing was wanted; and the fame of\nhandsome Elizabeth of \"The Star\" contributed not a little to bring\ncustom to the house.\n\nSuch Norwegians as came to Amsterdam with timber--the majority unloaded\ntheir cargoes up at P\u00c3\u00bcrmurende or Alkmar--invariably patronised \"The\nStar.\" Elizabeth used to talk to them as countrymen of her own; and if\nshe heard that any of them had been across the Atlantic, she would\nquietly, and as if quite casually, ask if perchance they had come across\nor had heard anything of a sailor of her acquaintance called Salv\u00c3\u00a9\nKristiansen who hailed from Arendal. No one had ever heard of him, and\nshe had begun to fear that he might be lost to her for ever.\n\nOne forenoon, however, when she had a great deal to do in the house, she\nwas passing quickly through the room up-stairs, and there sat at one of\nthe small tables, with an untouched mug of ale before him, a bearded man\nin a blue pea-jacket. In her hurry she had set him down as some mate or\ncaptain; but there must have been something about him that attracted her\nattention, for she turned again at the door for an instant, and looked\nat him before she went out. He was so pale--and he had sent her one\nlook.\n\nAs she stood outside the door she knew it was Salv\u00c3\u00a9, although she had\nalways pictured him to herself as a common sailor. She stood there\ntrembling all over, and fumbling with the latch of the door in the\ngreatest agitation, evidently debating with herself whether she should\ndare go in again. She pressed upon the latch, in the certainty that it\nwould go up before she had actually decided that she would go in; and it\ndid so. The door opened again of itself, and Elizabeth entered with\ndowncast eyes, and scarlet in the face, and passed through the room,\nmaking a slight inclination of her head, as if for greeting, as she\npassed him. She had reached the opposite door when she heard a quiet\nbitter laugh behind her.\n\nAt once she turned, with pride in every feature of her face, and looked\nat him.\n\n\"How do you do, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 Kristiansen?\" she said, firmly and quietly.\n\n\"How do you do, Elizabeth?\" he replied, rather huskily, getting up and\nlooking confused.\n\n\"Are you lying here in Amsterdam with some vessel?\"\n\nHe sat down again, for there was something in her manner that denied\napproach.\n\n\"No; in P\u00c3\u00bcrmurende,\" he replied. \"I only came in here to--\"\n\n\"You are in the timber line, then, now?\"\n\n\"Yes--Elizabeth,\" he ventured to add, in another tone, which had a whole\nvolume of meaning in it. But she took her leave of him now in the same\nproud manner, and left the room.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 sat for a while with compressed lips, looking down upon the table\nbefore him. When she turned round the first time at the door, something\ntold him that she would come in again; but he had expected quite a\ndifferent kind of scene. A good deal of the tyrant had been developed in\nhim since they had last met; and when she had come in so quietly and so\nhumbly, with the acknowledgment of the great wrong she had done him\nwritten upon her face, he felt himself at once, with a certain bitter\nand devouring pleasure, upon the judgment-seat. He must first see her\ncrushed before him; then he would have forgiven her, and loved her with\nall the passion of his soul.\n\nBut as she stood there by the door, looking so grand in her pride, and\nso pale with repressed mortification, and spoke so calmly, he had felt\nthat in that moment he had been separated farther from her than ever he\nhad been in all his wanderings at the other side of the globe.\n\nHe sat there with his mind in a chaotic state of desperation and sorrow,\nand of anger with himself. What a grand creature she was! and he--how\npitiful and petty! He set down the mug, which he had been absently\ntoying with, hard on the table, and went out.\n\nFor a long while he wandered about the quays in a state of gloomy\nindecision, stopping every now and then to run his eye over the\nshipping, and his expression becoming darker still every time he did so.\nFrom long practice he could tell by the appearance of every vessel what\ntrade it was engaged in. One was a coffee ship from Java; the next\ncarried general cargo to all parts of the world; there was another that\nbrought sugar and rum from the West Indies; and a fourth, that from its\nsquare build and breadth of beam must be a whaler returned from\nSpitzbergen. He thought of their long voyages, and of the life without\nroot or tie that was passed on board them--was he to go back to that\nlife again? It depended on Elizabeth; and he had not much hope.\n\nTo his impatient nature delay was intolerable; and he had half made up\nhis mind to have his fate decided at once. In spite of his agitation,\nhowever, he could still think with coolness; and he knew that if he was\nto have any chance at all, he must wait until the first unfortunate\nimpression had had time to pass off.\n\nIt had been a grey, foggy autumn day, but was now clearing, and blue\npatches of sky were coming out; and as he crossed the bridge the\nafternoon sun shone out, and sent a ray of glittering light against the\nwindow-panes of the street along the canal. Up in Garvloit's house\nElizabeth was standing at the open window--she, too, that day had needed\nto be alone with her thoughts. Salv\u00c3\u00a9 saw her, and stood still for a\nmoment contemplating her as she leant out over the window ledge.\n\n\"That dear head shall be mine,\" he burst out then passionately, and\nwithout knowing it, aloud; and the next moment he was at Garvloit's\ndoor.\n\nElizabeth heard the door of the room open behind her; and when she saw\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 unexpectedly standing before her, she sank down for a moment on to\na chair, but got up the next with a scared look, almost as if he was\nsome hostile apparition.\n\n\"Elizabeth!\" he said, gently, \"are you going to send me out again into\nthe world? God only knows how I shall come back if you do.\"\n\nShe did not answer, but stood looking at him with a rigid expression,\nand pale as death; she seemed to have forgotten to breathe, and to be\nonly waiting for him to say more.\n\n\"Be my wife, Elizabeth,\" he asked, \"and I shall grow up into a good man\nagain. What a pitiful creature I have been without you, you have already\nseen sufficiently this morning.\"\n\n\"God be my witness, Salv\u00c3\u00a9,\" she answered, the tears bursting into her\neyes with emotion which she tried to control, \"you alone have always had\nmy heart--but I must first know in perfect truth what you think of me.\"\n\n\"The same as I think of God's angels, Elizabeth,\" he said from his\nheart, and tried to take her hand.\n\n\"Do you know that I--was once very nearly engaged to young Beck?\" she\nasked, reddening, but with a steady look. \"I didn't know my real self\nthen, but was thinking only of folly and nonsense, until I was obliged\nto fly from it all.\"\n\n\"Your aunt has told me all about it, Elizabeth. Don't let us mention the\nsubject again.\"\n\n\"And you haven't a doubt about me in your heart? For that I never will\nbear, Salv\u00c3\u00a9, like to-day,--I can't bear it, do you understand?\" she\nsaid, with a shake in her voice, and looking as it were down into his\nvery soul.\n\n\"Doubt!\" he said; and for that moment, at all events, he was evidently\nconvinced that she had never given her real heart to any one but\nhimself.\n\nA look of inexpressible happiness came into her face; he caught her into\nhis arms, and they stood as if they never would let go of each other\nagain, cheek to cheek, not speaking, not thinking even. There was\nsomething convulsive in their embrace, as if they could not believe in\nthe reality of their happiness, and as if they felt an instinctive dread\nthat they should lose it again.\n\nUnobserved by either of them the door had opened, and in the doorway\nstood pursy Garvloit, gazing in helpless bewilderment at the scene\nbefore him. At last Elizabeth caught sight of him, and--not with any\nconfusion, but only eager to communicate her happiness--exclaimed--\n\n\"It is my lover--\"\n\n\"Your lover!\" and he fell back a step, as if he did not know what he was\ndoing.\n\n\"My name is Salv\u00c3\u00a9 Kristiansen, master of the Apollo,\" added Salv\u00c3\u00a9,\nwithout letting her go, and feeling everything around him infinitely\nsmall at that moment.\n\nGarvloit turned round and shouted several times from the top of the\nstairs, raising his voice at each repetition, \"Andrea! Andrea!\" to his\nwife; and as she did not come immediately, he stumbled as fast as his\ncorpulence would allow him down the stairs, pausing, however, with a\nvacant look upon the last step.\n\nMadam Garvloit came out with her work in her hand, and asked what the\nmatter was.\n\n\"The matter is,\" replied her husband, dismally, \"that I am ruined. There\nis Elizabeth up there sitting with some skipper, God knows whom, who she\nsays is her lover.\"\n\n\"Is it possible?\"\n\n\"Go and see for yourself;\" and as his wife hurried past him up the\nstairs, he added in the same dismal tone--\"Who shall we get to look\nafter the house now? we shall never have another like her;\" and he\nsighed profoundly.\n\nWhen Madam Garvloit appeared at the door, Elizabeth finished her\ninterrupted explanation.\n\n\"I have known him ever since I was a little girl,\" she said.\n\nIt was at once evident to her mistress that there must be a romantic\nstory here; but though brimming over with curiosity, she deferred her\nquestions until a more convenient season. In the meantime she manifested\nthe most lively sympathy; and after winning Salv\u00c3\u00a9's heart by telling him\nwhat a treasure Elizabeth had been to her, she begged that as long as he\nremained in Amsterdam he would come in and out of the house as he\npleased.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\n\nWhen Madam Garvloit had made some excuse next morning to leave the two\nalone together in her sitting-room, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 took out of his pocket a small\nparcel, and opening it deliberately, said, with a certain solemnity--\n\n\"Five years ago, Elizabeth, when I was in Boston, I bought these rings.\"\nHe took them out of the paper, and laid them in her hand. \"I have had a\ngood deal to bear since, but you see I have kept them all along\nnotwithstanding.\"\n\nShe threw her arms round his neck, hid her face upon his breast, and he\ncould feel that she was crying. She tried them on then, both on the same\nfinger, and holding up the hand to show him, said--\n\n\"That is the first ring I ever possessed.\"\n\nA shadow passed across his face, and it flushed slightly; and she only\nthen perceived what connection of ideas her remark might have suggested.\n\nHe had three days to spare before he was obliged to be back at\nP\u00c3\u00bcrmurende on board the old brig of which he was now master, and with\nwhich, patched and leaky though she was, after his sailor's pride had\nbeen overcome, he had grown to be well satisfied enough--more\nparticularly, perhaps, because she was his own. The happiness of these\ndays was not marred by a single further incident to remind him of the\npast; and it was only on the day that he was to leave that the foul\nfiend Distrust was again awakened in his unlucky heart.\n\nIt was a Sunday, and after the morning service there was to be a sort of\npopular _f\u00c3\u00aate_ in Amsterdam. At the famous town-hall, where, in\nHolland's great days, when De Ruyter's and Van Tromp's guns were\nthundering in the sea outside, the great merchant princes used to sit\nround the republican council-board, was to be exhibited that day, for\nthe first time, the new picture of the young Dutch hero, Van Spyck, who\nblew up his ship in the war of 1830 against Belgium.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 and Elizabeth joined the stream, and even caught some of the\nnational enthusiasm prevailing in the crowd that was swaying backwards\nand forwards in the courtyard, where a band was playing the stirring\nnational air, \"Wien Neerlands bloed door de aders vloeit.\"\n\nAt last they found themselves before the canvas. It represented the\nyoung cadet of seventeen years on the gunboat at the supreme moment.\n\nElizabeth stood with her hands clasped before her silently engrossed,\nwhile Salv\u00c3\u00a9 kept her from being pressed upon behind.\n\n\"Look!\" she said, turning half round to him, but without taking her eyes\noff the picture,--\"the Belgian captain is inviting him to surrender. He\nhas no choice--they are too many for him. But don't you see the thought\nhe has in his mind?--you can read it in his face. And what a fine\nfellow he looks, with his handsome uniform, and his epaulets, and his\nshort sword!\" she said, in a lower tone, with a revival of her old\nchildish enthusiasm for that kind of show.\n\nHer last words were like a dagger's thrust to Salv\u00c3\u00a9. She still had a\nhankering, then, for all this, and he stood behind her pale with\nsuppressed feeling, while she continued to gaze at the picture and think\naloud to him.\n\n\"Poor, handsome lad! But he never will surrender--one can easily see\nthat; and so he must go down,\" she said, in a subdued voice,\ninvoluntarily folding her hands, as if in fancy she went with him; \"and\nhe blows up Belgian and all into the air, Salv\u00c3\u00a9,\" she said, turning to\nhim with a fine spirited look in her face, and with moistened eyes.\n\nHe made no reply; and supposing that, like herself, he was lost in the\nscene before them, she turned again to the picture. But while, after\ngiving vent to her feelings, she stood there with a smile on her face,\nthinking that she knew one who would have been quite as capable as Van\nSpyck of such an exploit--the man, namely, who was then standing behind\nher--to him the picture had become a hateful thing; and he could have\nshot Van Spyck through the heart for his uniform's sake.\n\nThe whole of the way home he was silent and serious, and it was not\nuntil late in the afternoon that he at all recovered his spirits.\n\nAs this was to be his last trip for the year, the following spring was\nfixed for their marriage; and when he took his leave, it was with the\ngloomy presentiment that he had a dreary winter before him.\n\nCertainly, for the development of a morbid state of mind, no conditions\ncould have been more favourable than the enforced inactivity to which,\nwith many another, he was condemned for the long dark months during\nwhich the ice put a stop to navigation. To his restless, energetic\nnature, such prolonged inaction was little suited under any\ncircumstances, and in his present condition of mind it was little less\nthan disastrous.\n\n\"If she was only here!\" he would sometimes inwardly exclaim, as if\ncrying out for help against himself and the thoughts which he felt to be\nunworthy, but which nevertheless he could not shake off.\n\nHe often thought of writing to her, but was so afraid of saying\nsomething which he might afterwards regret, that he kept putting it off\nfrom time to time, until at last he could restrain himself no longer.\n\nHis letter ran as follows:--\n\n\n\"To much esteemed Miss Elizabeth Raklev--\n\n\"As concerning the Apollo, she lies in a row of other ships up in Selvig\nSound, and the ice is about a foot thick, and will be late in breaking\nup this year, they all prophesy: she is well looked after, and has a\nwatchman on board, and storage room has been taken for her rigging in\nPettersen's rigging-loft. But as touching her captain, to whom you said\nin Amsterdam you had given your full and first heart so firmly that it\ncouldn't be moved by any might or power in the world whatsoever--he has\nthought much and often about this, and would like to hold out and see\nyou again before all his shore cable is chafed away. It seems as if it\nwas holding by its last threads, and these half-scraped through. But if\nI could see you, it would become so strong again that it could hold\nagainst any stream; and you must forgive me for my weakness when you\nthink of those five years; but I won't say that it is your fault,\nneither make myself out better than I am, for I have confidence in you,\nElizabeth, if I have not the same reliance upon myself, and I can't help\nit if I haven't. When you read this letter, Elizabeth, you must remember\nthe poor sailor who is frozen up here, and not forget it afterwards till\nwe meet again, which I would give half my life-blood or more for, if it\nwas any use, as I am consuming away with impatience up here--I have such\na longing to see you again. And now, farewell from my heart, and God\nbless you. I will trust you and hope in you till my last hour, come what\nmay. Farewell, my dearest girl, with fond love from\n\n                                             \"SALV\u00c3\u0089 KRISTIANSEN.\"\n\n\nThis letter cost Elizabeth many a tear. She sat over it in the evenings\nbefore she went to bed, and felt so poignantly that it was she who had\nbrought him to this--that he could not trust her; for she understood but\ntoo well what lay between the lines. \"If I could only be with him,\" she\nthought, and she longed to be able to send him an answer; but she had\nnever learnt properly how to write or to compose a letter.\n\nWith some difficulty, however, and after several ineffectual attempts,\nshe managed to put two lines together which she remembered from the\nCatechism:--\n\n\n\"To my lover Salv\u00c3\u00a9 Kristiansen--\n\n\"You shall put your trust in God, and after Him, in me before all\nothers, who careth for you in all things, and have faith in me. That is\nthe truth from your ever-unforgetting\n                                            \"ELIZABETH RAKLEV.\nAnd in the spring,\n                                       \"ELIZABETH KRISTIANSEN.\"\n\n\nShe folded the letter, and got one of Garvloit's sons to write the\naddress; but, that it might be certain to go, she went with it herself\nto the post-office.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 received it one day with great surprise. He guessed from whom it\ncame, and delayed opening it in the fear that it might contain a\nbreaking off of their engagement occasioned by his own letter: he\nremembered that first morning in Amsterdam. What was his joy, then, when\nhe found what the contents actually were; he seemed to have the thing\nnow in black-and-white. He put the letter carefully back into his\npocket-book every time after reading it, and for a while was quite\nanother man. Still, it was high time that the ice should begin to break\nup, and that he should find occupation for his thoughts in work; he had\nbegun to be afraid to be alone with them.\n\nHis first voyage was to P\u00c3\u00bcrmurende, and thence to Amsterdam; and they\ndetermined to be married there and then, although he had but four days\nto stay while the brig was loading in P\u00c3\u00bcrmurende. Out of consideration\nfor the Garvloits, whom they wished to spare the expense of the wedding\nas much as possible, they insisted that they would be married on the day\nthey were to leave for P\u00c3\u00bcrmurende.\n\nThe morning on which the wedding took place, Garvloit's house put forth\nall its splendour. Dress suits from former days of better circumstances\nwere brought out from old boxes for the occasion; and Madam Garvloit\nappeared in a green-silk dress of stiff brocade, with a massive brooch,\nand a huge gilt comb that shone over her forehead like a piece of a\ncrown. Garvloit, too, did his best; but his utmost endeavour had only\navailed to adapt one article of his grandfather's state dress to his\ncorpulent person--a gold-laced waistcoat namely, which was much too long\nfor him, and which appeared to occasion him extreme discomfort in the\nregion of the buttons.\n\nA couple of old friends of the family and the children went with the\npair to church, and also the skipper's son from Vlieland, over whose\nround soft cheeks there trickled a regretful tear or two as the bride,\nwith her myrtle wreath and long white veil, was led up to the altar by\nGarvloit. Elizabeth wore that day a pair of particularly handsome shoes\nwith silver buckles, which Salv\u00c3\u00a9, with glad surprise, recognised as the\nones he had presented to her many years before.\n\nThere was an entertainment provided by Madam Garvloit when they returned\nfrom church, which was not a very lively affair, the Garvloits not being\nin spirits at the prospect of losing Elizabeth, and she, notwithstanding\nall her present happiness, being really sorry to go.\n\nA couple of hours after, they were on their way to P\u00c3\u00bcrmurende, and later\non in the mellow evening, were standing together on the deck of the\nApollo, as she was being towed up the wide canal. The bells were ringing\nout from Alkmar as they passed--ringing a sweet old chime of other days;\nand as they stood together by the ship's side, silently listening to the\nchanging tones from the tower as they mingled in the air above them,\nthey pleased themselves with the thought that it was their wedding\nchime.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n\nIn a small house at Tonsberg, at the entrance to the beautiful\nChristiana fjord, the first summer of their married life passed without\na cloud upon its sky. The house and all about it, with its flowers in\neach window, were a model of neatness and Dutch polish; and with\nElizabeth herself as a centre to it all, it was no wonder that Salv\u00c3\u00a9's\ncrew found him indifferent to all weathers when it was a question of\ngetting home.\n\nThe charming young skipper's wife, however, during her husband's\nfrequent absences, had attracted the notice of some of the leading\nfamilies of the town, and had come presently to be if not exactly on\nintimate terms, at all events on a footing of acquaintanceship with many\nof them; and Salv\u00c3\u00a9's enjoyment of his home ceased then to be so\nperfectly unalloyed.\n\nWhen Elizabeth recounted to him the flattering proofs of appreciation\nwhich she received, he listened in silence; and her social successes,\ninstead of giving him pleasure, had a precisely opposite effect. He\nwould not for the world have said a word to express his dislike of her\nmaking such acquaintances; and he even, when they went to church\ntogether on Sundays, liked her to be as well-dressed as any of these\nfine friends who now seemed to share his wife with him. But if he said\nnothing, and was even angry with himself for thinking about the subject,\nstill he did think about it, and with increasing irritation. He could\nnot get the idea out of his head that Elizabeth must now be always\ncontrasting him unfavourably with these people; and as he paced the deck\nof his brig alone out at sea, he would picture them to himself as\nconstantly in his house, and always talking on the subject which he\ncould least endure--the sacrifice which Elizabeth must have made to\nbecome his wife.\n\nWhen their son Gjert was born in the spring following their marriage, he\nhad been sitting by Elizabeth's bedside unable to tear himself away from\nher and the cradle, until a small present arrived from one of her\nfriends in the town, who with others had often sent to inquire after\nher, when he got up and went straight out of the house and paced\nbackwards and forwards with his hands behind his back outside, as she\ncould see through the window, thoroughly out of humour, though when he\ncame in again he was even more affectionate and attentive to her than\nbefore.\n\nAs she never for a moment imagined that he could think her deep love for\nhim could be in any way affected by the slight surface interest which\nher new acquaintances afforded her, she looked upon his jealousy of\nthem, of which she had had indications often enough before, as a\nweakness merely to which he ought to have been superior; and as he said\nnothing himself on the subject, she also let it pass without comment on\nher side, but determined at the same time that she would see less of\nthem in future, at all events while he was at home.\n\nIt happened however, unluckily, some weeks afterwards, that she had just\nbeen talking to some of them when he returned from an expedition to\nNotter\u00c3\u00b6 to hire a crew for his next voyage to Amsterdam, on which she\nwas to accompany him. \"Herr Jurgensen and his wife,\" she said, \"had just\npassed, and she had been talking to them; they were to start for\nFrederiksvoern on the following day.\"\n\n\"And fancy!\" she went on with animation, \"Fru Jurgensen knows Marie\nForstberg. So I asked her to remember me to her.\"\n\n\"Marie Forstberg?--who is she?\" asked Salv\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n\"She who was so kind to me,\"--she stopped here, and the colour came and\nwent in her face as she continued--\"it was she who married--Beck's\nson--the lieutenant.\"\n\n\"You ought to have asked Fru Jurgensen to remember me to Beck then at\nthe same time,\" he said, cuttingly, and went past her into the house\nwithout looking her in the face.\n\nElizabeth followed him, feeling very uncomfortable, and after standing\nfor a moment in indecision, went over to him, and sitting down on his\nknee, put her arm round his neck, saying--\n\n\"You are not angry with me, are you? I didn't think you would mind, or I\nwouldn't have done it.\"\n\n\"Oh! it's quite immaterial to me, of course, who you send your love to.\"\n\n\"She was my best friend when I was--in Arendal,\" Elizabeth said,\navoiding the mention of Beck's name again.\n\n\"I don't doubt you are on the best possible terms with all these\npeople,\" Salv\u00c3\u00a9 said, impatiently, and making a movement as if he would\nget up from his seat.\n\nIt was Elizabeth who rose first.\n\n\"Salv\u00c3\u00a9!\" she exclaimed, and was about to add more, when he pulled her\ndown to him again, and said in a gentle tone of remorse--\n\n\"Forgive me, Elizabeth. I didn't mean what I said. But I do so hate\nhearing you talk of these people.\"\n\nElizabeth burst into tears, protesting against his want of confidence in\nher; and Salv\u00c3\u00a9, now thoroughly distressed at the result of his want of\nself-control, overwhelmed her with tenderness in his endeavours to\nappease her. He succeeded after a while, and the evening was passed in\nsuch sunshine as only succeeds to storm.\n\nAfter a quarrel of the kind, however, there must be always something\nleft behind, and though Salv\u00c3\u00a9 was doubly affectionate for many days,\nafterwards he grew more and more silent, and presently even irritable\nand moody, and would not go to church on any of the succeeding Sundays\nwhile he remained at home.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n\nElizabeth carried out her intention of accompanying him to Amsterdam,\nwhere she paid a visit of several days to the Garvloits, and the\npleasure of the trip was only alloyed for her by the change which had\ncome over Salv\u00c3\u00a9's manner, and to which she had now to try and accustom\nherself as one does to a less brilliant light after having seen the sun.\n\nThey were on their way home again, sailing before a light breeze, and\nunder a soft blue sky, out of the busy, shallow Zuyder Zee. Elizabeth\nwas sitting on deck with little Gjert, blooming as a rose, and asking\nanimated questions of the pilot, whom they had been compelled to take on\nboard, about the various flat sandy islands and towns which came in\nsight from time to time, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 occasionally stopping in his walk to\nlisten.\n\nBy Terschelling the channel from the Zuyder Zee to the North Sea is\nmarked out like a narrow strait with black and red buoys; and even in\nthat calm weather there were foaming breakers the whole way close to the\nship on either side. \"What must it be like,\" Elizabeth asked, in a sort\nof terror, \"in a storm, when the whole sea was driving in?\"\n\n\"That is a sight it's better not to see,\" replied the pilot.\n\n\"But you have to be out, storm or not, pilot?\"\n\n\"It is my way of getting a living,\" he answered, shortly.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 stood and listened, as the conversation took this turn.\n\n\"We have pilots in Norway, too,\" she said, \"who don't mind a wet jacket\neither. It is a fine life!\"\n\nThe Dutchman merely observed, coldly, in reply--\n\n\"In two successive years--it is three years ago now--they lost out here\noff Amland a total of fifty pilots.\"\n\n\"Still, it is a fine life!\" she said; and Salv\u00c3\u00a9 resumed his walk.\n\nA couple of evenings after, the Apollo was pitching out on the\nDoggerbank in the moonlight, with a reef in her topsails. Elizabeth had\nnot yet gone below, and was sitting with her child warmly wrapped up on\nher lap, while Salv\u00c3\u00a9 paced the deck and looked at her from time to time.\nA little farther off, near the main-hatch, Nils Buvaagen (whom Salv\u00c3\u00a9 had\nmet again at Notter\u00c3\u00b6, and persuaded to take service with him) and a\ncouple of the crew who were off duty were engaged in story-telling, the\nothers lounging about near them to listen. Elizabeth, too, was\nlistening.\n\nThey had crossed that day a long stretch of dead water, and the\ncarpenter had several mysterious incidents, of which he declared he had\nbeen an eyewitness, to recount on the head of it. Meeting dead water\nlike that out in the open sea generally meant that something was going\nto happen.\n\nNils Buvaagen, like all fjord peasants, had a strong leaning towards\nevery kind of superstition; and in his many voyages across the North\nSea, he had had more than one experience of the kind in question. He had\nsat quite silent so far.\n\n\"H'm!\" he remarked now, thoughtfully taking a pull at his pipe. \"I dare\nbe sworn there's many a one out here on the Dogger. Where we are now, I\ntell you, is as it might be an old burial-ground.\"\n\nWith that he retired into himself, and began to pull away vigorously at\nhis pipe, as if he had unintentionally said more than he exactly liked.\nBut being pressed to go on, he was obliged to satisfy the curiosity he\nhad excited, and resumed accordingly in a hushed tone, after cautiously\nlooking round first.\n\n\"Do you know,\" he asked, mysteriously, \"how all the old fish come by\ntheir deaths?\"\n\nNone of his audience were able to give an answer to this unexpected\nquestion.\n\n\"You don't?\" he continued; \"nor no one else neither. But all the same,\nsuch myriads die every day that, if all was right, the whole surface of\nthe sea would be covered with their white bellies--we should be sailing\nall day long through dead fish. It is a 'mystery,' the same as it is\nwhat becomes of all the old ships in the world.\" Coming from him, that\nword \"mystery\" had something very weird and uncanny about it.\n\n\"Yes, the Dogger can be ugly enough, and may be so perhaps before we are\nclear of it,\" he concluded, and leant back against the spar behind him\nto look up at the clouds. Some scud was driving at the moment across the\nfull moon.\n\n\"But about the old fish and the old vessels, Nils?\" said the carpenter,\nrecalling him to the subject.\n\n\"Yes, it is here, to the Dogger Bank, that they resort for the most\npart, and to one or two other places perhaps in the world besides. That\nis the reason that there is always a sort of corpse sand in the water\nhere, and so many noises and things that one can't explain.\"\n\nThere was a general start as he said this, and they looked at one\nanother in silence; for it seemed as if the vessel had suddenly stopped\nwith a shock in the middle of her course, and the spray from a heavy sea\ncame pouring down over the deck.\n\n\"She heard it,\" said the carpenter, involuntarily; \"she is an old craft,\nand doesn't like going over the churchyard.\"\n\nElizabeth thought that last proposition sounded so uncomfortable that\nshe got up and went below to bed.\n\nThe sea ran high in the night, and the vessel kept pitching with dull\nthuds as if they were in very shoal water, which, however, the lead\nshowed not to be the case. In the morning the chain-cable of the anchor\nwas found tossed by the force of the sand-laden seas right over the\ndeck, and arranged there with a certain regularity. To many of the crew\nit seemed clear that other than natural causes must have been at work;\nthere were evidently \"dead hands\" upon the bank, and this was a warning.\nNils shook his head and said nothing.\n\nAll the morning they were enveloped in a thick sea fog that surrounded\nthem like a wall; but towards noon the sun began to appear like a sickly\ngleam above them, and by dinner-time they were sailing under a clear\nsky, and in a fresh green breezy sea, with sails on every side.\n\nIt was an exhilarating sight, and reminded Elizabeth of the days of her\nchildhood. She called Salv\u00c3\u00a9 over to share her enjoyment of it.\n\nOf all the vessels in sight, the handsomest, without comparison, was the\nNorth Star, a Norwegian corvette, well known along the coast of Norway,\nand which had often aroused Elizabeth's enthusiasm in earlier days. She\nwas crossing their course, and standing under full sail for the Channel.\nElizabeth recognised her at once, and exclaimed decisively--\n\n\"That is the North Star--isn't she a magnificent ship, Salv\u00c3\u00a9! See, they\nare taking in the topsails; they look like a flock of birds up there on\nthe yard among those beautiful big sails. Did you ever see anything so\ngrand as her shape? and how majestically she ploughs through the sea!\nWhen she has all her canvas spread like that, I could fancy Tordenskjold\nhimself on board of her in full chase.\"\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 looked straight before him and didn't answer. He knew, what\nElizabeth had not the faintest suspicion of, that Lieutenant Beck was on\nboard the North Star, as third in command for that year's cruise in the\nMediterranean, whither she was now bound; and a host of unpleasant\nassociations were raised by Elizabeth's innocent admiration of her.\n\n\"It was the North Star,\" she continued, \"that beat through the straits\nof Gibraltar against the current when none of the others could.\" The\nNorth Star had long ago taken the place of the Naiad as her heroine\nship, and she related the performance with a certain pride.\n\n\"How would you like to be in command of a ship like that, Salv\u00c3\u00a9?\" she\nasked, determined to wake him up and get an answer.\n\n\"It would be a very different thing from having such an old tub as the\nApollo under one--there's no disputing that,\" he replied bitterly; and\nquitted her side abruptly, as if to give orders to the crew.\n\nElizabeth remained standing where she was, utterly puzzled. What could\nthere possibly have been in what she had said to offend him? and\noffended he certainly was by the tone of voice in which he was giving\nhis orders, and the expression of his face as he stood there by the\nwheel with his hand in the breast of his pea-jacket--she felt certain it\nwas clenched there. It was really too unreasonable--the idea of his\nbeing jealous of a ship! This uncertainty about every word she spoke now\nwas getting absolutely insupportable, and with a toss of her head she\ndetermined that she would stand it no longer, but would speak her mind\nto him once for all, whether it should lead to a scene or not.\n\nNo opportunity, however, for carrying out her intention occurred during\nthe remainder of the afternoon. There appeared to be bad weather coming\nup, and many of the sails had to be taken in; and afterwards he paced up\nand down by the round-house forward for a couple of hours, purposely, as\nshe could see, avoiding her. The crew apparently had an impression, too,\nthat it was as well to keep out of his way, as they left him that side\nof the deck to himself, and stood talking in knots about the capstan,\nwith their oilskin coats and sou'westers on, in anticipation of dirty\nweather, and casting anxious glances from time to time at the banks of\ncloud that were rolling up darkly from the horizon to leeward, and\nsending already a whine through the old rigging above them. They waited\nimpatiently for the word to take in more sail, as it was obvious that\nthey must go with storm sails only for the night.\n\nIt was only at the last moment apparently that Salv\u00c3\u00a9 made up his mind,\nfor when he suddenly shouted over to them to take in topsails and put a\ncouple of reefs in the mainsail, the storm was already upon them. He\nsprang aft at the same time and seized the trumpet, saying shortly and\nharshly to Elizabeth as he passed her hurriedly, and almost without\nlooking at her--\n\n\"This is not weather for sitting up on deck, Elizabeth. You had better\ntake the child below and lie down.\"\n\nElizabeth saw that he was right, and went; but there was a look of\npained surprise in her face as she lingered for a moment and looked\nafter him. He had never spoken to her like that before.\n\nThe crew had supposed that he would of course keep away and run before\nthe gale, and not strain the old brig by beating to windward in such a\nnight as they saw before them; and it was under mute protest, therefore,\nthat they proceeded to carry out his orders to clap on preventer braces\non the rags of sail which they were carrying. The old blocks creaked and\nscreamed in the increasing darkness above the rattle of the hail\nsqualls, and the vessel careened over and went plunging into the head\nseas with successive shocks that seemed likely very soon to shake her to\npieces.\n\nNils Buvaagen was standing in moody silence, with another, at the wheel,\nand he could see by the light from the binnacle, which occasionally fell\nupon Salv\u00c3\u00a9's face as he walked up and down near them to leeward, that he\nwas ashy pale. He would have liked to say something, but it didn't seem\nadvisable.\n\n\"Topsail's flapping!\" came from forward, \"she'll be taken aback!\"\n\n\"She's an old craft, captain--her topmasts'll not bear a great deal,\"\nNils ventured to observe.\n\n\"I'll show you that I can make the old tub go,\" muttered Salv\u00c3\u00a9 between\nhis teeth, affecting not to have heard what was said.\n\n\"Keep her away, Nils--she must have more way--and so over on a new\ntack,\" was his reply in a peremptory tone.\n\n\"Stand by to 'bout ship!\"\n\nNils sighed: such sailing was quite indefensible; and there was not one\nof the crew who had not the same feeling.\n\nThrough the darkness and the blinding dash of the seas came then at\nintervals--\n\n\"Haul in the boom--hard a-lee--brace forward--brace aft!\" and here there\nwas a longer interval, for one of the ropes on the foremast had\napparently got foul, and there was a difficulty in bracing the yard, the\nsail flapping with a dull noise above and making the whole mast tremble.\nOne of the crew had to mount the old rigging at the risk of his life,\nand feel over the unsteady yard in the dark for the rope and disentangle\nit, with the white tops of the seas breaking not far under his feet.\n\n\"Sharp up aft--sharp forward!\" came then again. \"Haul the jib-sheet!\"\nbut no sooner was the jib hauled taut and made fast, than it broke loose\nand hung fluttering wildly about the stay until it gradually twisted\nitself up into a tangle.\n\nThe sails filled on the new tack; but they were not much better off than\nbefore, the sea breaking over them with such violence that the deck,\nfrom amidships forward, was only passable with the greatest difficulty\nand danger. The crew began to think the captain must have taken leave of\nhis senses; and, in fact, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 was not himself that night. He was\nsailing in this reckless way in a mere fit of temper intensified by the\nconsciousness of his own unreasonableness. Elizabeth made a mistake, he\ntold himself by way of justification, if she thought that he on board\nhis poor brig gave in to any officer in the navy, let him be who he\nmight. She should see that he, too, was a man who could beat--he\nrequired no North Star under him, he would perform the same feat in a\nleaky old barge.\n\nA couple of times when the cook, who looked after Elizabeth's wants,\ncame up the cabin stairs, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 inquired how she was getting on, and\nheard each time that she was sitting up not yet undressed. The last time\nthe good-natured cook had added--\n\n\"She wants badly to see you, captain--she isn't accustomed to this sort\nof thing.\"\n\nHe made no reply further than a scornful contraction of his features\nwhich was not visible to the other, and resumed his staggering walk to\nleeward, between the companion and the wheel.\n\nElizabeth meanwhile had been sitting a prey to most distracted thoughts.\nWhen she went below with her child, she had a dull feeling at her heart\nthat some great sorrow had come or was coming over her, and she had sat\nfor some time almost without the power to think. He had never treated\nher like that before.\n\nShe set about putting the child to bed then in her usual way, as if she\nhad been a mere machine. For him the rolling berth was only a rocking\ncradle, and he was soon sleeping quietly without an idea of danger. She\nstood with her arm leaning over the edge of the berth, supporting him,\nand gazing on his dimpled face; the lamp that swung to and fro under the\nbeam, shedding a dim light over the narrow cabin, with its small table,\nand pegs full of seamen's clothes, moving solemnly backwards and\nforwards on the wall. Between the creaking of the ship's timbers and the\nnoise of ropes being dragged across the deck, Salv\u00c3\u00a9's voice could be\nheard in harsh tones of command, and every now and then there would be a\nsudden concussion that would make the whole vessel shake, and the floor\nwould seem to go from under her feet, so that she had to hold on by the\nrail of the berth, and keep the child from falling out as best she could\nat the same time. Whenever they had had such weather before, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 had\nalways come down from time to time to see her. Now--she didn't know what\nto think. From what the cook had told her, she gathered that they were\nbeating with unjustifiable recklessness, and from the tone of Salv\u00c3\u00a9's\nvoice she knew that he was in a savagely defiant mood, and that she, for\nsome reason or other, was the cause of it. Her expression gradually\nchanged to one of deeper and deeper anxiety of soul.\n\n\"But what have I done to him?\" she exclaimed impetuously, and buried her\nface in the bedclothes.\n\n\"What have I done to him?\" she repeated. \"What can he believe?--what can\nhe possibly think?\" she asked herself, as she stood now like a statue\nalmost, lost in conjecture, until the thought which she had always tried\nto keep away came up before her in full, heavy, unmistakable clearness.\n\n\"He doesn't trust me!\" she whispered to herself, in despair. \"He has no\nfaith in me;\" and she laid her head--her beautiful head--down upon her\narm, just as her own child might have done, in an inconsolable fit of\ncrying. But to her no tears would come, and she seemed to see an abyss\nof suspicion and distrust before her in which Salv\u00c3\u00a9's love for her was\ngoing to disappear.\n\nShe heard no longer the creaking and the noise on deck--no longer cared\nabout the lurching and the thuds against the head-seas--although she had\noften to hold on to the berth with all her strength. All the energy of\nher soul was now occupied with this one awful terror which had taken\npossession of her. All her defiance was gone. Her only source of courage\nnow was to do anything or everything to keep his love. She felt ready\nfor any sacrifice whatever--ready, without a sigh, to bear the burden of\nhis suspicions all her life through if she might only keep his love. It\nwas she who had made him distrustful, and it was upon her the punishment\nshould fall, if she could not by persistent love bring him back to a\nhealthy condition of mind again.\n\nHer instinct at once suggested to her how she should begin. He should\nsee that she on her side had entire confidence in him--confidence as\nabsolute as the child's there who was sleeping before her. And with a\nsickly smile upon her lips, she undressed and laid herself down beside\nlittle Gjert.\n\nUpon deck Salv\u00c3\u00a9 had wanted the night-glass, which was down in the cabin.\nThe look-out man had fancied that he had caught a glimpse for a moment\nof a light, in which case, against Salv\u00c3\u00a9's calculations, they must be\nunder Jutland. His pride, however, would not allow him to send any one\nelse to fetch the glass, and he couldn't make up his mind to go down\nhimself. At last it became absolutely necessary, and he went hurriedly\ndown the stair.\n\nWhen he opened the cabin door he stood still for a moment in surprise,\nand looked about him. He had expected to find Elizabeth sitting up, with\nthe child on her lap, and looking frightened. In place of that all was\nquiet, and the lamp was nearly out. He strode on and took the glass from\nthe wall; and after a couple of attempts, managed to light a match, in\nspite of the damp, and held it to the barometer. He remained then\nstanding with it in his hand, and listened to hear whether she was\nasleep or not. Involuntarily he approached the berth, and looked into\nit.\n\n\"Elizabeth,\" he whispered, softly, as if he was afraid of waking her.\n\n\"Is that you, Salv\u00c3\u00a9?\" was the reply, in a perfectly calm voice.\n\n\"I thought you would be sitting up with the boy in this gale. She rolls\nso; and I--I haven't been down to see you,\" he said.\n\n\"I knew I had you on deck, Salv\u00c3\u00a9,\" she replied. \"The rest we must only\nleave to God. You have not had time to come down, poor fellow,\" she\nadded, \"you have been so busy.\"\n\n\"Elizabeth!\" he exclaimed, with a sudden pang of passionate remorse, and\nreached over impetuously into the berth to embrace her with his wet\nclothes.\n\nAt that moment a crash was heard, accompanied by a violent trembling of\nthe ship, and loud cries on deck. Something had evidently given way.\n\nWith the same movement with which he had intended to embrace her, he\nlifted her quickly out of the berth, and told her to dress herself and\nthe child, and come up to the top of the cabin stairs. The words were\nhardly out of his mouth when the vessel heeled over, and didn't right\nherself again.\n\n\"Fore-topmast gone, captain; rigging hanging!\" bawled Nils Buvaagen down\nthe stair.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 turned to her for a moment with a face full of mute, crushing\nself-reproach, and sprang up on deck.\n\n\"Keep her away, if she'll answer her helm!\" he shouted to the man at the\nwheel. \"To the axes, men!\"\n\nThe brig lay over on one side, with her brittle rigging at the mercy of\nthe wind and sea, the waves making a clean breach over her. Salv\u00c3\u00a9\nhimself went up and cut away the topmast, which went over the side to\nleeward; and as the first grey light of dawn appeared, and made the\nfigures of the crew dimly distinguishable, the axes were still being\nfeverishly plied in strong hands among the stays, backstays, and topmast\nrigging. While the work was going on the fearful rolling caused first\nthe main-topgallant sail to go, and then the topsail, with the yards and\nall belonging to it. The forestay snapped, the mainsail split, and the\nlower yards and foremast were damaged. And when at last, after desperate\nefforts, they had succeeded in freeing the ship from the encumbrance of\nthe fallen rigging, she lay there more than half a wreck, and scarcely\ncapable of doing more than run before the wind.\n\nThey had only the boom-mainsail now, and the forecourse, left; and with\nthese Salv\u00c3\u00a9 kept her away--it was the only thing now to be done--until\nthe growing light should show them whether they had sea-room, or the\ndreaded Jutland coast before them. The last, with this westerly gale\nblowing, would mean pretty nearly for a certainty stranding upon the\nsandbanks and the vessel becoming a wreck.\n\nWhen it was clear day, they made out Horn's Reef far down to the\nsouth-east; they lay about off Ringkjobing's Fjord, and would require\nnow to do their utmost to clear the coast. With some difficulty they\nsucceeded in rigging up a jury-mast, and managed by that means to keep\nup a little closer in the wind. But their only chance was that the wind\nmight go down, or shift a little to the southward, or in the current,\nwhich generally takes a northerly direction here, unless it should set\nthem in too much under land.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 paced restlessly up and down his dismantled deck, where a great\npart of the bulwarks and the round-house forward were stove in, whilst\nthe crew relieved each other two and two at the pumps. They had\nevidently sprung a serious leak, which was the more cause for anxiety\nthat they were returning in ballast, and had no timber cargo to keep\nthem afloat. He had confided their situation to Elizabeth.\n\n\"I am afraid we may be obliged to beach her at some convenient spot,\" he\nsaid, adding, with a slight quiver in his voice, \"we shall lose the\nbrig.\"\n\nHe laid emphasis upon this, because he didn't wish to tell her the\nworst--namely, that this convenient spot was not to be found upon the\nwhole coast, and that their lives were unmistakably in danger.\n\nWhatever happened, it seemed sufficient for Elizabeth that he was near\nher, and there was a look of quiet trust in her face as she turned\ntowards him that went to his heart; he could not bear it, and turned\naway.\n\nThe brig and its possible loss did not occupy much of Elizabeth's\nthoughts. In the midst of their danger she was absolutely glad at heart\nat the thought that by her display of implicit confidence she had\nsucceeded in winning a great victory with Salv\u00c3\u00a9. After what she had gone\nthrough that night, this was everything to her.\n\nThere was a fine energetic look of determination in her face, and her\neyes were moist with tears as she bent over the child in her lap and\nwhispered--\n\n\"If he cannot trust us, we two must teach him--mustn't we, Gjert?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n\nTowards dinner-time Salv\u00c3\u00a9 and Nils Buvaagen were standing for a moment\ntogether by the ship's side.\n\nThe storm had perceptibly lulled, but the weather was still dull and\nhazy, and the sea high. Two or three sea-gulls were circling drearily\nbetween them and the coast, where they could now see a long line of\nyellow foaming breakers like a huge wall, rising and falling on the\nsandbanks, with here and there a mast-high jet of spray from some reef\noutside. Although the wind was on shore they could hear the dull thunder\nof the breakers there, and a kind of dim rumbling in the air. The next\nthree or four hours would obviously decide their fate.\n\nNeither spoke; each was occupied with his own reflections. Nils was\nthinking of his wife and children at home, and Salv\u00c3\u00a9 of his future. It\nwas hard to lose the brig; he had worked hard for the money she\nrepresented, and he would have now to begin again on the lowest step of\nthe ladder--if he escaped with his life, that was to say.\n\nLess selfish thoughts succeeded then, and he turned to Nils.\n\n\"What I feel most in this business, Nils,\" he said, earnestly, \"is the\nthought that you or any of the others may perhaps pay the penalty for my\nmad sailing last night, with your lives. The brig is my own affair.\"\n\n\"Oh, it will be all right, captain, you'll see,\" replied Nils,\ncheeringly. \"If we can hang on to the old craft while she bumps over the\nbanks, we shall manage somehow or other inside I expect.\"\n\n\"God grant it!\" said Salv\u00c3\u00a9, and turned away.\n\nNils remained standing where he was for a moment, and something like a\nspasm passed across his heavy features. He believed their situation to\nbe desperate, and the vision of his home again rose before him, and\nalmost choked him.\n\n\"Relieve the pumps!\" was heard. It was his turn again, and he gave\nhimself unweariedly to the work.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 seemed like one conscience-smitten. His face wore an expression of\nstrained uneasiness, and his look more and more, as the moments passed,\nbetokened the consciousness that a struggle for life was before them.\nThrough the glass a knot of people could be seen gathering on the downs\nwhich ran along the coast, with their jagged formations showing out in\ntones of dim violet and blue.\n\nHe stood now in the companion with his wife and his child, and sighed\nheavily as he looked at them.\n\n\"I would gladly give the brig, and be reduced to my own two hands once\nmore, to have last night over again, Elizabeth!\" he said.\n\nShe pressed his hand with an expression of sympathy, which answered him\nbetter than words; and the next moment he was again the practical man,\nshowing her how she might tie the child to her breast with a\nhandkerchief.\n\n\"I can't stay with you any longer now,\" he said. \"I am responsible for\nthe lives of all on board, and must do my duty by them.\"\n\n\"Do your duty, Salv\u00c3\u00a9,\" she said.\n\n\"And so,\" he concluded, as, trying to conceal his emotion, he stroked\nher forehead and then the child's, \"you must keep a good heart. When the\npinch comes I shall be at your side, and we shall win through it, you'll\nsee.\"\n\n\"With God's gracious help!\" she answered; \"remember that, Salv\u00c3\u00a9.\"\n\nHe strode away then down the deck and called the crew aft to take\ncounsel with him on the situation. The vessel was rapidly becoming\nwater-logged.\n\n\"Listen, my lads!\" he said; \"this is a serious business, as you can all\nvery clearly see. But if we only have stout hearts we may get out of it\nyet, at all events with our lives. We have about three hours still\nbefore we run upon the sandbanks; but by that time it will have begun to\nget dark, and it may be difficult for the people on shore to come to our\nrescue. We must steer straight in and choose the likeliest place\nourselves; and if you are of the same way of thinking we'll head for the\nshore now at once, rather than wait to have the old craft flung over the\nbanks in the dark like a dead fish.\"\n\nThe crew were silent, and looked anxiously over towards the land. But\nwhen Nils Buvaagen declared himself a supporter of the captain's plan by\ncrossing over the deck to him, all the others followed.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 went himself to the wheel, and gave the order to \"Ease off the\nsheet.\"\n\n\"Ease it is,\" was the answer; and that was the last order ever given on\nboard the Apollo.\n\nRunning now before the wind, they rapidly approached the land. Salv\u00c3\u00a9\nstood at the wheel, resting his knee from time to time on one of the\nspokes, with a concentrated look on his dark keen face, and his eye\nsearching like a kite's along the coast for the place they were to make\nfor. A couple of times he took up the glass and directed it towards the\ndowns, where a group of people were moving about.\n\nThe chalk-white wall of water, rising and falling, grew higher and\nhigher as they approached it; the noise and the dull roar of the\nbreakers became more and more deafening, and a feeling of faintness\ncrept over Elizabeth as she looked towards the land, and began to\nrealise their danger.\n\nThe suspense was so painfully prolonged, a mist was coming before her\neyes, so that she could scarcely see Salv\u00c3\u00a9 over at the wheel; and she\ntried, in her terror, to keep them fixed upon the child in her arms. The\nseething, hissing sound in the air around her kept increasing, and made\nher giddy; a confusion of wild sounds, that grew louder and ever louder,\nseemed to fill her brain; and before her eyes there was nothing but a\nwhirl of scudding flakes of white. A mass of sand-laden foaming water\nappeared then suddenly to rise before her with a towering crest; she\nheard one loud cry of terror from different voices; the brig seemed\nlifted high in the air; the mainmast tottered; and a suffocating deluge\nof water came crashing down upon her, nearly carrying her with it down\nthe cabin stairs, where she was clinging. Again and again it came, and\nher one thought now was to hold fast.\n\nWhen she returned to consciousness again, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 was by her side. They\nwere fastened to the same rope, and all the crew had come aft, and\nlashed themselves there. The brig lay over on her side upon the inner\nbank, with her stern up, and with the mainmast lying over the side. She\nkept lifting and striking heavily against the bottom, while heavy seas,\none after another, swept her forward.\n\n\"The rigging to leeward must be cleared away, and we shall get off,\nlads!\" shouted Salv\u00c3\u00a9, through his hollowed hand; and he sprang over with\nan axe to do it. Nils Buvaagen came to his assistance, and Elizabeth, in\nintense anxiety, watched the two men while they cut away rope after\nrope, holding on by the rigging all the time, the sea breaking over\nthem, so that sometimes they were hardly visible through the drench of\nwater. After one last stroke, which freed them from the mast, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 was\nby her side again.\n\nThe next moment they were carried over the bank by the yellow churning\nsurge, and with a succession of jerks and bumps, over to the shoal\ninside, where the bow-timbers were stove in--\"the best thing that could\nhave happened to them,\" Salv\u00c3\u00a9 said, coolly, \"as it would relieve the\nvessel of the weight of water in the hold, and they might now be washed\nup nearer to the beach.\"\n\nAt length, after a couple of long and terrible hours, as twilight was\ncoming on, and the face of the downs was becoming darker in the gloomy\natmosphere, it seemed as if the vessel had finally settled. The waves\nnow broke less frequently over her, but left a heavy deposit of sand\nupon the deck when they did break. It seemed likely that she would go to\npieces, plank by plank, if they remained as they were through the night,\nor else perhaps they would be buried in sand.\n\nOn one side of the shoal--on the side where they saw people upon the\nbeach--ran a channel with a strong current; and they, perceived that\nthey had been fortunate to some extent in not having been washed right\nover into it, as in that case the brig must inevitably have sunk: on the\nother side there was navigable water, though with breakers here and\nthere. Their signals, they knew, had been seen by the people on shore;\nbut, to their despair, they saw them all at once disappear.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9, upon that, set to work to lash some planks together for a raft;\nand the crew followed his example with whatever they could lay their\nhands upon that would float. His idea was, to try and get Elizabeth and\nthe child to land by tying them securely to the raft, and trust to his\nown swimming powers and address to reach the shore with the line he was\nattaching to it; and the only question then would be, whether he would\nbe able to haul it to land against the strong back-suck of the receding\nwaves, that left every time a long stretch of dry sand behind them.\nElizabeth was sitting meanwhile on the cabin-stairs, scarcely in a\ncondition to comprehend what was passing.\n\nAs Salv\u00c3\u00a9 was occupied with this work, he suddenly heard a shout of joy\nround him. From behind a projection in the downs a group of men had\nappeared, carrying a large boat. They stopped at a corner of the beach.\nA number of them took their seats in the boat; and as a wave was curling\nover to break, the others ran her down, and the back flow carried her\nout to sea, the men setting to work at once with all their might at the\noars.\n\nThe plucky fellows evidently knew the water thereabouts; for they\nsteered in a wide circle up behind a line of shoals, that acted like a\nmole in breaking the force of the waves, and bore down then obliquely\nupon the wreck, to leeward of which the water was comparatively smooth.\n\n\"Now then, look alive, my hearties!\" they shouted, as they hooked on;\nand the admonition was scarcely needed.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 carried his almost unconscious wife down to the side, where they\ntook her and laid her aft in the bottom of the boat; but she sat up with\noutstretched arms until her child had been passed to her from hand to\nhand, and was safe in them again, and then she watched anxiously for\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 to come too. He sprang down into the boat the last, and then she\nfainted.\n\nThey put off, and stood in now on the crests of the waves straight for\nthe beach, where a score of men in sea-boots and woollen jackets made a\nchain down into the water by holding each other's hands, and drew the\nboat ashore.\n\nThey heard congratulations all round; and the man who had held the\ntiller exclaimed, as Salv\u00c3\u00a9 silently grasped his hand--\n\n\"It was resolutely done, Northman, to steer like that--only that you\ndid, you'd have passed the night upon the bank.\"\n\nThe invitation of their rescuers to partake of such hospitality as they\ncould offer was gladly accepted by the famished party from the wreck;\nand they followed the steersman, Ib Mathisen, and his comrades in among\nthe downs, where the wind was no longer felt. It was some miles to the\nfishing village; and they trudged on after it grew dark in silence,\nbeing too exhausted, and too dejected, to talk, their guides only\nkeeping up a low conversation among themselves. Salv\u00c3\u00a9 carried the child,\nsheltering it from the pricking sand that blew in their faces when they\ncame out upon the flat downs farther on, and supporting Elizabeth at the\nsame time.\n\nAt last they saw the lights of a group of cottages. The largest of these\nbelonged to Ib Mathisen; and into this Salv\u00c3\u00a9 and his wife were\nconducted, while the crew were distributed among the others.\n\nIb's wife, a robust-looking woman of fifty or thereabouts, with a bold,\nstraightforward expression in her tanned countenance, was standing over\nby the fire with her sleeves tucked up baking, when they came in. She\nexamined the incomers steadily for a moment without raising herself from\nher stooping position; but at the sight of Elizabeth and the child she\nexclaimed in a tone of compassion that was better than any more formal\nwelcome, \"The poor woman and her child have been cast ashore, Ib?\" and\nset about caring for their wants at once, her grown-up daughter helping\nher to draw a bench to the fire for them, and putting a kettle on to\nmake something warm for them to drink. This was evidently not her first\nexperience of the kind; and before long they had all put on dry clothes,\nand Elizabeth and the child were in a warm bed. As she went about she\nput questions in a low voice to her husband; and Salv\u00c3\u00a9, who was sitting\nwith his cheek in his hand staring into the fire, heard her say--\n\n\"Perhaps he was the owner of the vessel himself?\"\n\n\"Yes, she was all the property we possessed,\" Salv\u00c3\u00a9 answered, quietly.\n\"But we are none the less grateful to your husband for rescuing us, and\nwe have unfortunately very little to thank him with for venturing his\nlife out on the banks in such weather.\"\n\n\"So you've been at that game again, Ib,\" said the wife, turning to her\nhusband reproachfully, but not seeming altogether sincere in her\nreproach.\n\nTurning to Salv\u00c3\u00a9 then she said a little curtly, \"For the like of that we\ntake no payment,\" adding in a milder tone, \"We have two sons ourselves\nwho ply to Norway--there's a bad coast there too.\"\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 was pale and worn out with over-exertion, and after taking a\nmouthful of food he lay down to rest. But he could not sleep, and\ntowards morning he was lying awake listening to the dull booming of the\ndistant sea. Elizabeth was tossing about feverishly and talking in her\nsleep. Her brain was evidently busy with the terrors of the previous\nnight, and from occasional words it seemed as if he had a share in her\nthoughts. He lay and listened, though there was not much to be made out\nof her disjointed utterances. She grew more restless, and began to talk\nmore excitedly--\n\n\"Never! never!\" she said, vehemently; \"he shall never hear a word about\nthe brig,\" and she went on then in a confidential whisper--\n\n\"Shall he, Gjert? He shall find us in our berth, or else he will think\nwe are afraid.\"\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 kissed her forehead tenderly, but with a sigh. There had been a\nmotive then, after all, at the bottom of that display of confidence\nwhich had occasioned him such pangs of self-reproach.\n\nA couple of hours after he was on the way down to the sea to look at the\nbrig. The general aspect of the world about him was in harmony with his\nmood. The wind whistled over the dreary sand-hills, whirling the sand in\nclouds in among the downs that stretched away like a storm-tossed sea\ninto the distance, in every variety of desolate and jagged outline. Upon\nthe melancholy shore a sea-gull or two were circling round some old\nblack stumps of wreck that protruded from the sand; while beyond lay the\ndismal expanse of the western sea, without a sail upon its leaden waste\nof waters, so shunned by all. Dreariness, wreck, and desolation were on\nevery side; and it seemed to Salv\u00c3\u00a9 that it was only a reflection of his\nown life. He had got to be the owner of a brig, and there it lay, what\nremained of it, buried in the sand. He had succeeded in making Elizabeth\nhis own, but had he thereby added anything to the happiness of his life?\n\nHe stood gazing at the remains of his brig, over which the yellow waves\nwere breaking, in a state of gloomy abstraction, from which he was only\naroused by the approach of Ib Mathisen and a party of his own crew, who\nhad followed him to the shore to see if possibly they might retrieve\nsome of their property. He joined them in the search, and with but small\nresult; three ship chests and the compass being all the reward of an\nhour's labour among the timber-ends and bolts and pieces of rigging that\nstrewed the beach, or made ripples in the sand for a long distance in\neither direction.\n\nThey remained that day in the fishing hamlet; and when Salv\u00c3\u00a9 had made\nhis declaration before the authorities, and had paid the crew what he\nowed them with the greater part of the money he had saved, he and\nElizabeth took passage for Christiansand in a corn ship from Harboere.\n\nHe was very silent on the way, thinking about his future; and the\nprospect was not a bright one: he knew that there prevailed but one\nopinion among the crew about the loss of the brig, that he had his own\nfolly only to thank for it; and as this, of course, would get about, his\nchance of being employed as a skipper by any shipowner would be very\nsmall. Elizabeth's popularity in Tonsberg might probably be of service\nto him, but he would sooner starve than help himself to a situation by\nmeans of it; and in her present circumstances she should not even return\nto Tonsberg.\n\nOne only course remained open to him if he was not to begin again from\nthe very beginning--he would become an uncertificated pilot for the\nArendal district. No one knew the coast there better than he did; he had\nalways had the idea in his mind, ever since the night when he brought\nthe Juno into Merd\u00c3\u00b6; and out there, or in some other spot along the\ncoast, he reflected gloomily that he could have Elizabeth all to\nhimself.\n\nWhen he announced his decision to Elizabeth, she entered with animation\ninto the project; and when he went on to add, that she would have to be\ncontent now with being only a common man's wife, she replied,\nintrepidly--\n\n\"If he is only called Salv\u00c3\u00a9 Kristiansen, I require nothing more.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\n\nIt was so arranged then; and though Elizabeth was rather disappointed to\nhear that she was not to see her tidy house at Tonsberg again, she\nallowed no indication of the feeling to escape her, and Salv\u00c3\u00a9 went by\nhimself to arrange their affairs there.\n\nWhen he had sold what property they had, and bought his pilot-boat, they\nhad still a small sum left with which to begin housekeeping afresh, and\nMerd\u00c3\u00b6 was chosen for their future residence.\n\nFrom the outside this island looks only like one of the desolate series\nwhich form the outworks of the coast for miles here in either direction,\nwith many a spot of angry white marking the sunken rocks between. But\nthe inner side forms the well-known Merd\u00c3\u00b6 harbour of refuge, with its\nlittle hamlet of fishermen's and pilots' houses on the strand; and it\nwas in one of these, a little red painted house with a small porch in\nfront and a flagged yard and garden behind, and which presently became\ntheir own, that they eventually settled.\n\nThe coast outside Merd\u00c3\u00b6 is exceptionally dangerous, but the Merd\u00c3\u00b6 pilots\nhave also the reputation of being exceptionally brave and skilful. They\nare also perhaps the widest known. For having no defined district they\ntake a wide range, and may to-day be lying off Lindesnaes, to-morrow\nunder the Skaw or the Holmen, and the day after board a ship from\nHamburg right away down at Horn's Reef. It is a common thing to meet one\nof them with his Arendal mark, his red stripe and number on the\nmainsail, trawling for mackerel far out over the North Sea, and even\ndown as far as the Dogger Bank, where they get information from foreign\nfishing smacks of vessels from the Channel or from English or Dutch\nports. If a skipper wants news from the North Sea or Skager Rack, he\ngenerally keeps a look-out for one of these pilot-boats, and finds a\nliving shipping list, and the newest too, on board, which costs him, at\nthe most, supposing he has nothing of interest to impart in return, a\nroll of tobacco, a bottle of spirits, or a strand of rope. But it is to\nthe captain who, on some pitch-dark winter night, when the sea is\nrunning mountains high, has come in beneath bare poles under the\nTorungens, and who knows that he is doomed if he cannot get a pilot,\nthat these Merd\u00c3\u00b6 men are most familiar. When, perhaps, he has given up\nall hope, he suddenly hears himself hailed from the darkness; a line is\nthrown; and a dripping pilot stands upon the deck. When the sea is too\nrough to board a vessel in any other way, they do not think twice about\ntaking a line round their waist and jumping overboard; and when it is a\npoint of honour with them to bring in a ship, boat and home and life\nweigh but very little in the opposite scale.\n\nThe black-bearded Salv\u00c3\u00a9 Kristiansen soon came to be the best known in\nArendal of them all. The dauntless look in his keen brown eyes, his\nsharp features, and his short, sudden manner and way of speaking, gave\nthe impression of a character of uncommon energy; and it was said that\nnot the very wildest weather would deter him from going to sea. He was\nknown to have more than once stayed alone on board a water-logged vessel\nwhile he sent his comrade on shore for help; and in his little room at\nhome, with its white-painted windows, and geraniums, and Dutch\ncuckoo-clock, there stood above the roll of charts and telescope on the\nwall a bracket with more than one silver goblet upon it, which, like the\ntelescope, were presents in acknowledgment of his services in piloting\nvessels into port under circumstances of unusual difficulty and danger.\nBut, notwithstanding the repute in which he was held, he had never yet\nreceived the medal for saving life, nor had he yet been made a\ncertificated pilot of the district.\n\nHe was not a man who gathered comrades round him; and as the years\npassed, his unapproachability of demeanour, which seemed intended to\nconvey to people with a certain bitterness that he could do very well\nwithout them, increased. It was said up in the town that he had taken to\ndrink. For after selling off his mackerel down on the quay, he would\noften now sit the whole day in Mother Andersen's parlour with his\nbrandy-glass before him; and when evening approached, and his head had\nhad as much as it could carry, it was just as well to keep out of his\nway. He did not talk much; and what attraction he found in Mother\nAndersen's parlour it was not easy to say. But they knew, at all events,\nhow to treat him there; and he felt, from the casual questions that\nwould be addressed to him after he had returned from sea, or from the\nway in which a newcomer would salute him, that he was in a sympathetic\natmosphere, and that his name was in repute. It was even something more\nthan respect, perhaps, which he inspired, for a sailor would think twice\nbefore sitting down beside him, unless it came natural to him to do so\nfrom the way in which they had greeted or spoken to one other.\n\nIt was not, however, any attraction which he found in Mother Andersen's\nparlour which made him spend so much of his time there; it was that he\nwas afraid of his own temper at home.\n\nWhen he had first set up on his own account, and had had his appointment\nas a duly certificated pilot for the object of his ambition, he had\nnever made it his habit to stay in Arendal when he returned from sea\ninstead of going home. But some two or three years after he had settled\nout at Merd\u00c3\u00b6, a couple of incidents had occurred which made a new\nstarting-point, as it were, in his domestic life. They were the\nnomination of Captain Beck, who was now a wealthy man, to the post of\nmaster of the pilots of the district, and who, as such, became his\nsuperior; and the arrival of Carl Beck to live in Arendal and\nsuperintend his father's shipbuilding yard, for which purpose he had\nretired from the navy. Since the arrival of the Becks he had become more\nand more difficult to get on with; and Elizabeth's secret, self-denying\nstruggle grew proportionately harder. Whenever she returned from a\nshopping expedition to Arendal, or from seeing her aunt, she would be\nsure to find him in an irritable humour, which would generally vent\nitself in contemptuous remarks upon old Beck's incapacity for the post\nhe held; and at last, much as she longed to get a glimpse now and then\nof something different from the monotony of her daily life out on Merd\u00c3\u00b6,\nshe gave up going altogether.\n\nHer patience and self-suppression had had the effect, as years went on,\nof making a tyrant of her husband. When in one of his dark moods now, he\nwould not tolerate the slightest contradiction from her or from any one\nin the house, and all she could do was to be quietly cheerful and\naffectionate, and to try her best to avoid falling into any of the traps\nwhich he would lay to catch her, and to make her, by some chance word or\nother, or even by a slightly displeased or resigned expression, give his\nbad humour an excuse for breaking out. She had to weigh every word she\nuttered, and to take the most roundabout methods of avoiding his\nsensitiveness, and after all, she would perhaps commit herself when she\nleast expected it; upon which a scene would immediately ensue, that\nwould be all the more unpleasant from his never expressing himself\ndirectly. Sometimes Salv\u00c3\u00a9 was really desperate, and would terrify her\nwith all kinds of threats, not against her, but against himself--and she\nknew he was just the man to carry them out. It had often happened that\nfor some unlucky word of hers he had gone to sea again an hour after\ncoming home; and once in such weather that she had not the faintest hope\nof ever seeing him return.\n\nShe would sit at home and weep for hours together, striving to repress\nthe angry feelings of resentment which would rise from time to time when\nshe thought how little return she received for all she gave; how less\nthan little her happiness was considered; and how meagre a reward for\nall she had to endure were the two or three days perhaps of occasional\nhappy calm and sunshine in her home, when she seemed to have him with\nher as he had been in the first early days of their married life, and\nwhen he would find it as hard to tear himself away from his home again\nas she knew he had often found it to return. What a heart he had in\nreality! She alone knew that--the others judged him only by his hard and\nharsh exterior. And how proud she was of him when she heard the others\ntalking of the daring things he had done, and saw how they all looked up\nto him! But it was not enough. And in the dulness and loneliness of her\nlife out there on Merd\u00c3\u00b6, she enjoyed to the full, during these many\nweary years, her woman's privilege of suffering for the man she loved.\nBut it was not to be so always. Brighter days--little as she now\nexpected them--were still in store for her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\n\nWe may leave for a moment the contemplation of a domestic history\nlighted up at present by such few and fitful gleams of sunshine, and\nglance at the married life of another pair who have figured in this\nstory, and who have not been without their influence upon whatever there\nmay have been of tragic in its development.\n\nThe young Becks, as they were called in contradistinction to the\nmaster's family, were now among the first people in Arendal, and kept\none of the best houses in the town, which they had ample means to do,\nfor the shipbuilding business brought them in a considerable annual\nincome. Carl Beck had lost none of his attractiveness as he grew older.\nHis curling black hair had now an early sprinkling of grey in it, but\nwas always arranged to the very best effect; and there was, people said,\nsuch a nobleness about him (his cleverness was undisputed) that when he\nrose to propose or reply to a toast, there was not a lady at the table\nwho was not in a flutter of inward admiration. With his social\nadvantages he could not, of course, fail to be in a position of\nconsiderable influence in the town, which again heightened his welcome\nin society.\n\nBut if he was thus made much of, it was not altogether the same with his\nwife. The estimate of her which generally prevailed, that she was so\nperfectly \"correct,\" was not intended perhaps to be complimentary, but\nimplied at the same time a recognition of her social power. She was, in\nfact, her husband's timepiece, and without her tact he would not have\nkept himself as straight as he did in the midst of the gushing welcomes\nwhich he found on all sides.\n\nIn his relations with his wife he was a pink of chivalry, never omitted\nthe most trifling attention, and was always being complimented on being\na pattern husband. Some few of the intimates of the house seemed to\nthink, though, that there was something strange in their attitude to one\nanother--a sort of coolness and reserve about both--and it was whispered\nthat his wife did not appreciate him as she ought; it seemed as if the\ntwo talked together best when strangers were present. Fru Beck, too,\nalways looked so uncommonly pale, and was so frigidly calm, that it\nmight have been supposed she had no feelings at all; and in comparison\nwith his overflowing warmth of nature she certainly did seem dreadfully\nprecise and cold.\n\nWhen they first came to Frederiksv\u00c3\u00a6rn as a young newly-married couple,\nher colour had been fresh, and her expression showed that she was still\nin love; she was then completely under the spell of his attractive\nwarmth of manner, and felt safe in the possession of his love. It was\ntrue, a couple of failings, which contrasted strangely with the idea she\nhad formed of him from his manly bearing, had gradually disclosed\nthemselves--namely, an extraordinary vanity, and an almost ridiculous\ndependence upon the opinion of the world. But so long as his heart was\nin the right place, and she could feel that he loved her, these\ndisappointments were matters of but secondary consideration to her. She\nfelt that she even loved him all the more for these weaknesses; and she\ntrusted to the power which she was gaining over him more and more every\nday to get them presently corrected.\n\nThe charming Lieutenant Beck became sought after everywhere, and his\nsuccess with the ladies resulted in his having very soon established\nsentimental relations with nearly every member of the fair circle around\nhim. He nearly always had a flower in his buttonhole when he came home,\nwhich had been jokingly given to him as a _gage d'amour_ by some one or\nother of his admirers; he received presents from all sides; and they, in\nfact, laid a sort of embargo upon him as an object of general\nadmiration.\n\nThere was nothing to say against all this--far from it; but the only\nperson who felt left out in the cold was his own wife, who seemed to see\nthis enthusiastic crowd gradually establishing, as it were, a\nprescriptive right of way between herself and her husband, and treading\nunder foot the very flowers that should have grown only for their own\ntwo selves in the intimacy of their home. She became gradually a less\nanimated, but was still, he thought, an interested listener, when he\ncame home after being in the society of his lady friends, and recounted\nhis triumphs. If this was so, she at all events began to be more\nparticular about her own dress and appearance, and set to work now to\nsystematically cultivate the social talent which she naturally\npossessed. She determined to conquer her rivals, who had the advantage\nof her in appearance, but were inferior to her in talent; and she\nsucceeded. But she became naturally an object for their criticism in\nconsequence.\n\nThe only one with whom she did not succeed was her husband. His\nself-love was far too much taken up with the small flatteries of all\nkinds, and the homage of which he was the object, to have any eyes for\nthe very great compliment indeed which was being paid to him by his wife\nin the line which she had adopted. To her he was married, and therefore\nof her he was always sure enough.\n\nIt was from that time that she dated the influence which she usually\nacquired in the social circles she frequented, and which her husband's\nposition and circumstances made it easy for her to maintain when they\nchanged their residence to Arendal.\n\nBut those first years of their married life had not passed without a\nserious, and to her completely decisive, _\u00c3\u00a9claircissement_. It was\noccasioned by his relations with the wife of an officer of rank, which\nhad become really more intimate than her pride could stand, although she\nknew very well that on her husband's side it was only a sort of mixture\nof vanity and policy that prompted his affectation of devotion. She had\ntreated the lady with marked coldness at a party where they had met, and\nher husband had taken her to task for it when they got home.\n\nEntirely wrapped up in himself as he was, it had never occurred to him\nthat his wife could have any cause of complaint against him, and what\nshe had been going through had been altogether lost upon him. She did\nnot say much now in reply to his reproaches--she merely stood and looked\nat him in a way that made him feel rather uncomfortable, and then\nquietly left the room. He could hear her going with slow steps up the\nstairs.\n\nAn hour or so after, she came down again into the room with a light in\nher hand. Her expression was cold, and she did not look at him as she\nset about putting the room to rights for the night as usual. He tried to\npacify her, begged her not to take what he had said so much to heart,\nand was going to put his arm affectionately round her waist, but was\nstopped on finding himself suddenly confronted by the deadly pale face\nand flashing eyes of an infuriated woman.\n\nThe time had come to speak out, and she did speak out; and Lieutenant\nBeck heard what he would have been very sorry to repeat to his best\nfriend. For he felt in his heart that it was nothing but the truth,\nhowever soon he might forget it again.\n\nShe called him a pitiful wretch, who would sell her and everything they\njointly prized to the first comer for a little miserable flattery. He\nhad distributed himself to that extent among his giddy acquaintance, she\nwent on, with a movement as if she thrust from her something she utterly\ndespised, that there was nothing left of him for a woman with a vestige\nof truth or honour to pick up.\n\nWhen her husband threw himself upon the sofa, and exclaimed in a\nsentimental tone that he was a miserable man, she repeated the last word\ntwice in an inexpressibly contemptuous tone--\n\n\"A man!--a man!--if you had been a man, you would still have had my\nlove--at all events a remnant of it; but now, like this light\nhere,\"--and she puffed it out,--\"all is extinguished between us.\"\n\nWith that she left the room.\n\nBeck sat where he was, overwhelmed and stupefied at this sudden blow\nwhich had fallen upon his domestic happiness, and with a horrible\napprehension that she might have meant what she said in real earnest.\n\nShe sat in the room with her child the whole night, and he knew that he\ndared not disturb her.\n\nNotwithstanding the struggle which it cost his pride, he was almost\nhumble in his manner towards her for some days after, and warmly and\ncordially acknowledged that he had been in the wrong. He even tried to\nshow her that he was in earnest by assuming for a while an altered\nattitude towards the ladies, and actually succeeded so far that she\nappeared to have forgotten that anything had occurred between them, and\nwas just the same in her intercourse with him as before--quietly\nfriendly that is to say, as she had been of recent years.\n\nIt never came to any real reconciliation on her side. She had seen too\nclearly that his nature was only that of a drifting cloud, glowing for\nthe moment just as it was played upon by popular applause; and he was\ntoo profoundly selfish for any real earnest love to find a root in his\ncomposition, much less to give promise of a common life-growth. With his\nfeeling and good-nature he would have treated any wife well, even if she\nhad not made herself so necessary to him as she was; her social talent,\nshe felt, was her great safety--it made him look up to her; and his vain\nnature required that she should be something to be proud of: but she was\nforced to acknowledge in her own heart with despair that she had been\nblinded by her love for him, that his nature was absolutely deficient in\nconstancy and truth, and in every quality which she had once persuaded\nherself to see in him. She knew the secret about this man, so brilliant\nbefore the eyes of the world--that he was not a man. He lived and moved\nbefore her now like a defaced ideal, to which she was tied--to the end\nof her life. The bitterness of disappointment rankled in her mind, and\nwas all the more poignant that she had to keep it shut up within herself\nand had no one to confide in. Her life had become a desert, and at the\nvery moment when her husband would be making a brilliant little speech\nthat called forth applause all round the table, she would seem to hear\nnothing but a rattle of emptiness. She always protested to her parents,\nwhen they could not understand why she looked so pale, that she was\nperfectly happy; and they had no reason to think otherwise, for she\nseemed to be well cared for in every respect. The only real interest\nwhich she possessed now in life was her son Frederick; but she brought\nhim up with the utmost possible strictness, for she fancied she detected\nhis father's nature over again in him.\n\nShe had always retained her warm interest in Elizabeth, and the messages\nwhich she had received from her from time to time had always given her\npleasure. She had never felt so attracted towards any one since as she\nhad been to that girl; and now after her great disappointment,\nElizabeth's features, so full of character and expression, were\nconstantly before her. She had seen her sometimes in Arendal, and\nthought she knew the reason why Elizabeth always seemed to avoid meeting\nher; for she had found once, by chance, among some old letters in one of\nher husband's drawers, the note which Elizabeth had written to him.\n\nIt had been no shock to her. By that time she had come to know his\nvolatile nature, and had given up all hope of ever being more to him\nthan another would be.\n\nOn the occasions when she had caught a glimpse of the pilot's wife in\nthe street, she had looked searchingly into her face to try and satisfy\nherself whether she looked happy. But she had not been able to do so;\nthere seemed to be something on Elizabeth's mind. And taking this\nimpression in connection with what she heard of the pilot, of his\nhardness and uncompanionable temper, she thought that it was clear\nenough that Elizabeth too, was unhappy in her married life, and longed\nto have a talk with her, to know whether she herself was not the more\nunhappy of the two.\n\nNor had Fru Beck's uncommon pallor escaped Elizabeth's notice, and she\nalso longed to have a talk again with her friend of former days; but\nBeck's house was for many reasons impossible ground for her. As she was\nstanding one day with Gjert on the quay, about to start for home, Fru\nBeck passed a little way off, leaning on her husband's arm, and looked\nback with an expression so sad, and with eyes that seemed to linger so\nlongingly, as if she had something she wanted to say, or to confide,\nthat they nodded involuntarily to one another.\n\nSince then they had never met, for from that time Elizabeth had scarcely\never been in Arendal.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\n\nGjert was now ten years old; and whilst his father was sitting over his\nglass in Mother Andersen's parlour, he used generally to amuse himself\nout in the harbour with a number of the Arendal boys with whom he had\nstruck up an acquaintanceship, and who understood very little about\ndifferences of social position.\n\nThe brown-haired, brown-eyed little lad, with his sharp, intelligent\nface, was the wildest of them all, and enjoyed a certain consideration\namong them at the same time as his father's son--an honour which he\nevidently thought it incumbent upon him to maintain by every kind of\nbreak-neck exploit. His proper business, of course, was to look after\nhis father's boat in his absence; but as it was safely moored, and could\nbe seen just as well from any of the yards in the harbour, he used\ngenerally to wait in some such conspicuous position till his friends\ncame streaming down to the quay from school, and throwing their books\ndown, sailed out in some punt or other to join him. Most of the boys had\nbeen expressly warned by their mothers against the reckless\nKristiansen's son, but cross-trees and mast-heads became thereby only\nthe more attractive.\n\nOld Beck's grandson, Frederick, who was going to be a naval cadet, had\nfancied one day that he would escape observation from the windows at\nhome by climbing up to join his friend at the mast-head, on the other\nside of the mast; but the slender spar was not sufficient to protect him\nfrom the master-pilot's keen eye, and the latter came himself on board\nin full grandfatherly indignation against the skipper for allowing such\npranks to be played on board his craft, thrashed Gjert for being the\ncause of his grandson's disobedience, and told him that it was very\nclear what he would come to some day--that he came of a bad stock, and\ntook after it. His own little scion, although a couple of years older\nthan Gjert, escaped punishment altogether--the other lads, however,\ndetermining among themselves that he should have it the next time they\nmet. And he would have had it, if Gjert, who should have been the one\nmore particularly to desire revenge, had not unexpectedly taken his\npart.\n\nIt was only as they were sailing the cutter home that the pilot heard\nhow Beck had thrashed his son, and cast his horoscope. His smurched face\ngrew white as a sheet. But when Gjert went in to tell him how, all the\nsame, he had taken Frederick Beck's part, his father looked at him in\nsurprise, and then muttered something about \"telling this to his\nmother.\"\n\nElizabeth had seen the boat pass Merd\u00c3\u00b6 for Arendal the day before, and\nshe was sitting indoors now expecting her husband, having commissioned\ntheir youngest and only other son, Henrik, to keep a look-out, and come\nand tell her when he saw his father coming. Henrik, however, had\nentirely forgotten her injunctions in the more interesting occupation of\ncatching shrimps in one of the salt-water pools which a recent high tide\nhad left among the rocks; and there, in the bright afternoon, over the\nblue and gold sea, dotted with sails, was the boat with its stripe and\nnumber already close by, standing straight in for the harbour with a\nflowing sheet.\n\nWith all her deep love for her husband, Elizabeth always awaited his\nreturn now with a certain dread; and as she sat there by the window with\nher work, in her rather foreign, Dutch style of dress, with the rays of\nthe evening sun streaming in upon her through the geraniums, she did not\nlook a happy woman. She was pale, and from time to time leaned her cheek\nfor a moment on her hand, and closed her eyes with a wearied look, and\nthen went on again determinedly with her sewing. When she heard his\nvoice unexpectedly outside the door, she jumped up hurriedly, but\nstopped then with a half-frightened look, hesitating whether to go out\nand meet him or not.\n\nWhile she hesitated the door opened, and her expression changed at once\nto one of cheerfulness, and apparently glad surprise.\n\n\"Well, mother, how goes it?\" he cried, as he entered, in a light and\ncheery tone, which took in a moment a weight off her heart; \"and where\nis the 'bagman'?\"--a pet name he had for his youngest son, when he was\nin good humour.\n\nGjert's adventure with Beck's grandson had made him a different man\nto-day, and had immeasurably lightened for the time his wife's task; but\nshe was very careful not to let him see that she found him any different\nfrom usual. Still, as she helped him off with his pilot-coat he noticed\nthat her hand trembled. His attention was diverted, however, at the\nmoment by the appearance of Henrik in the doorway, looking very\nfrightened and conscious, and with his trousers still tucked up over his\nbare legs, and with the tin cup, in which he had his shrimps, in his\nhand.\n\nGjert came in now with some of the things for the house which his father\nhad bought in Arendal, and impressing the doleful-looking \"bagman\" into\nthe service, took him down with him to the boat to help him to bring up\nthe rest. He had only given his mother a hurried kiss, as he had seen at\na glance that all was right this time. When it was otherwise, he always\nkept by her, and, in look and manner, gave her all the help he could. He\nhad seen from his childhood, and comprehended so much of the unhappiness\nof her relations with his father, that he had constituted himself her\nfriend and support, although, at the same time, he was devoted to his\nfather. When Gjert was in the boat, Elizabeth had a sort of security\nthat Salv\u00c3\u00a9 would at all events not be absolutely reckless; and Gjert\nalways took care that she should have news of them by other pilots or\nfishermen from Merd\u00c3\u00b6, from the different places they put in to. If the\nboy was not with his father she would sometimes send him in to Arendal\nto look for him.\n\nThis time the pilot made a long stay at home, and during the whole time\nnot a single domestic jar occurred. For a couple, indeed, who had been\nmarried as long as they had, such unbroken harmony would, under any\ncircumstances, have been remarkable. Little Henrik had even had his\nfather as a companion on one of his shrimping expeditions; and much of\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9's time had since been taken up in rigging a little brig for his\ndelighted son.\n\nThe only point upon which a harmless little difference occurred was the\nquestion of Gjert's schooling. They were very fairly well-to-do people\nfor their position, and his mother had one day, as if the idea had\nsuddenly occurred to her, asked why they should not send him to school\nin Arendal; he would be able to lodge with her aunt there, she said. His\nfather, however, would not hear of it, and dismissed the subject very\nshortly by saying that when Gjert was old enough, he intended him to go\nto Tergesen's rigging-loft in Vraangen and learn to rig.\n\nHis mother could not, however, so easily dismiss the ambitious scheme\nfrom her mind, and it became, a few days after, the occasion of the most\nviolent scene which had ever yet put her strength of purpose to the\ntest, but from which there ensued eventually the very happiest results.\n\nA man-of-war had lately come up to Arendal from a cadet cruise to the\nMediterranean, and Gjert had been allowed to go over with one of the\nother pilots to see her.\n\nApart from the sensation which her lofty rig, the shining brass stoppers\nprotruding from her gunports, her swarm of sailors, and the sound of the\nshrill whistle and occasional beat of drum on board, suggestive of\nman-of-war discipline, created, curiosity had been further excited by\nsome rumours which were in circulation about her cruise having been a\nflogging cruise; and among Gjert's friends, and indeed among the harbour\npeople generally, she was so much the object of awe, that whenever the\nwhistle sounded, it would darkly suggest the thought that another\nflogging was going to take place, and any boats that were near at the\nmoment would sheer off to a more comfortable distance. There was just so\nmuch truth in all this that there was one very hot-tempered officer on\nboard who was very much hated by the crew, and who had been unfortunate\nenough to single out for flogging just the man whom, if he had been\nbetter advised, he would have left alone--the song-maker, namely, of the\nship. The result had been that ever since a mystic refrain, sufficiently\nsignificant, however, had been sung at the capstan, and had found its\nway on shore, where it was in the mouth now of every boy about the\nharbour.\n\nGjert's curiosity about everything connected with the vessel was\nunbounded, and Frederick Beck, with whom he had established a close\nfriendship since that little affair with the other's grandfather, when\nGjert had saved him from punishment, could not tell him half enough.\n\"Fancy,\" he thought, \"to be able to go about in a uniform all covered\nwith gold like the officers there on board!\" He could think and talk of\nnothing else all the time they were sailing home next day.\n\nThe wind had risen to half a gale, and they had three reefs in the\nmainsail. His father, who for some days past had been wandering with\nincreasing frequency up to the flag-staff, or down to the quay, where he\nwould stand with his hand behind his back alone, and look about him in\nan eager, restless way--sure signs that he was getting tired of being on\nland--had been up several times to look out for the boy, and was now\nsitting in the house, pasting together an old chart, as his son came up\nfrom the quay shouting out the new song at the top of his voice against\nthe wind. He stopped in the porch to collect his breath to give the last\nstanza with effect, and husband and wife as they listened exchanged\nglances.\n\nIt was easy to see when he came in that he was bursting with the\nconsciousness of having all sorts of wonderful things to relate. His\nmother had just laid the table for their evening meal, and as he greeted\nthem in an off-hand sort of way, he drew a chair over to the table at the\nsame time, that he might be ready to fall to the moment the food was set\ndown.\n\n\"Well, Gjert,\" said his mother, after he had sat and looked round him\nfor a moment or two, evidently expecting to be invited to gratify their\ncuriosity, \"were you on board?\"\n\n\"Not myself; but I talked to others who had been. For that matter I saw\neverything that was to be seen,\" he assured them with a self-conscious\nnod, reaching over at the same time for a crust of bread--\"from the\ntopmast of the Antonia, a schooner that was lying close alongside. She\nbarely reached up to the Eagle's bulwarks; she would just about make a\nlong-boat for her--\"\n\n\"If she was a good deal smaller,\" said his father, drily, completing the\nsentence for him, as he went over and placed the chart upon the top of\nthe small cupboard in the corner.\n\nGjert began then, addressing himself to his mother, to support his\nassertion by a comparison of the height out of the water of the\nschooner's hull and of the corvette's, by assuring her that the vane at\nher mast-head had not reached higher than the man-of-war's mainyard,\n&c., but he was interrupted by his father--\n\n\"What song was that you were singing out there?\"\n\n\"Oh, it was the one about the flogging cruise.\"\n\n\"It really was one then?\" said the pilot, with a searching look at his\nson. He did not easily give credence to gossip of the kind.\n\nTo be addressed by his father in this interested tone was highly\nflattering to Gjert's self-love. It was this, in fact, that he had been\neager all the time to tell them about; and he burst out now with the\ndeepest conviction in his manner--\n\n\"That it was, father! Some say six, others nine; but that they were all\nflogged within an inch of their lives and put in irons down in the\nMediterranean is as certain as--as,\" he looked about him eagerly here\nfor something that should be duly emphatic, and when no other more\nstriking illustration suggested itself, had to wind up finally with this\nrather lame one--\"as that the cuckoo is standing up there on the clock.\"\n\nThe intelligence had the effect of bringing his mother to a seat, with\nthe plate on her lap, while she looked apprehensively from her son to\nher husband. There was nothing, however, in the aspect of the latter to\njustify her apprehension.\n\n\"Who did you hear this from, Gjert?\" she asked.\n\n\"Who did I hear it from? From everybody.\"\n\nBut bethinking him then that in his incredulous home \"everybody\" would\nbe reckoned about as valuable an authority as \"nobody,\" he continued--\n\n\"From Frederick Beck. He had talked himself with one of the sailors who\nwas in charge of the officers' gig down by the landing-stairs while his\nchief was on shore; and that wasn't all he heard, but a lot of other\nqueer things besides.\" Here he looked round him evidently with a\nsatisfied feeling that he must have convinced them this time at any\nrate.\n\n\"He seems to have been a credible kind of a chap, that sailor,\" observed\nhis father with a mild irony, which escaped his son, however; while his\nmother looked at him in some anxiety lest he should be going to sit\nthere and make a fool of himself. \"Well, and what further did he tell\nhim?\"\n\n\"Oh, lots of things.\"\n\n\"Let us have them.\"\n\n\"He said they had had such a hurricane down there, that they came across\na whole town that had been blown away drifting out in the middle of the\nsea, with a minister praying in the midst of it;--then, that they had\nrun so close in to the land in beating up the Straits of Gibraltar, that\nthey had taken a palm-tree on board on the end of the bowsprit with a\nwhole family of negroes sitting in it, whom they had afterwards to put\nashore.\"\n\nGjert would have delivered himself of still another curious incident if\nhe had not been brought up by the laughter of his parents. The \"bagman\"\ntoo, was laughing, because he saw the others doing so, and received a\ncrushing look accordingly from Gjert, who drew in his horns at once.\n\n\"Perhaps you don't think it's true?\"\n\n\"Do you know what it is to spin a yarn, my boy? That lad down in the gig\nhas been spinning you a fine one,\" said his father, as he sat down to\nthe table.\n\nGjert continued to talk all through the meal, and when it was over,\nwhile his mother came in and out of the room, and his father sat over at\nthe window, partly listening and partly looking out at the weather. He\ndescribed everything he had seen with such life and vividness,\nparticularly all that concerned the officers and the cadets, that his\nmother sat down to listen, and his father, when there was a moment's\npause, observed with a quiet laugh--\n\n\"I daresay you would have liked to have been one of the cadets yourself,\nGjert?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said his mother, beguiled for a moment by the dazzling thought.\n\"If he were only to go to school in Arendal no one knows what might\nhappen. The clerk says that nothing is any trouble to Gjert.\"\n\nSomething in this observation must have struck discordantly upon her\nhusband's ear, for he changed colour and replied shortly after, somewhat\nsarcastically--\n\n\"It's my opinion that Gjert is not too good for his father's station,\nand that we are not going to make interest with anybody to hoist him up\ninto the company of his betters, as they call themselves.\"\n\nGjert's previous animation had been very much heightened by the picture\nwhich such a glittering prospect presented to his fancy, and he cried\nnow, without taking warning by his father's changed tone--\n\n\"Mother was saying, though, the other day, that if I were to be a cadet\nI should cut a better figure in the world than as an ordinary common\nsailor.\"\n\nIt was as if a match had been thrown into a gunpowder-magazine. His\nfather's hard face flushed up wildly, and he threw over at his wife a\nlook of inexpressible, cold scorn. Turning savagely away, he said in a\ncutting tone, that seemed to go through her--\n\n\"Do you also despise your father's station, my boy?\"\n\nWhen Gjert blundered out then in his eagerness--\n\n\"Frederick Beck is going to be a cadet,\" it was followed simply by--\n\n\"Come here, Gjert!\"--and he received a blow that sent him staggering\nagainst the table. A second was about to follow, when his father\nhappened to look up at his wife. She had sprung a couple of steps\nforward, as if to take Gjert from him, and was standing now before him\nwith crimson face and flashing eyes, and with a bearing that made him,\nat all events, lower his hand. She then turned away at once, and went\nout into the kitchen.\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 stood for a moment uncertain how to act. Then he went to the\nkitchen door, and announced, shortly and sharply, that he and Gjert were\ngoing to sea that evening--they would want provisions.\n\nThe wind and rain beat wildly against the black window-panes while\nElizabeth was carrying out his orders; but when she presently came in\nwith the ale-jar and what else they were to take with them, not a trace\nof anxiety, or of her former emotion, was to be detected. Her face was\npale, and stony-calm; and there was something almost humble in her\nbearing towards her husband. But when, for a moment, she and Gjert were\nleft alone together in the house, drawing him hastily towards her, she\nwhispered, in a voice choked with repressed emotion--\n\n\"Never let your father see that you are afraid, my boy.\"\n\nShe bade her husband farewell at the door; and there was foul weather\nboth within and without the pilot as he put to sea that evening.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\n\nElizabeth was more agitated even than usual after a scene of this kind.\nWhen he had struck her son, her indignation had almost mastered her; and\nit frightened her now to think how near she had been to an explosion.\nThis time the so-often-repeated excuses which she had accustomed herself\nto make for him would not suggest themselves; and as she lay awake in\nthe stillness of the night, and looked back through the years that were\ngone, it seemed as if she was struggling and labouring on for ever\nwithout any prospect of getting nearer to the goal, and that her\npatience was wellnigh exhausted. Had she no claim at all to\nconsideration? or must she be for ever silent like this, till one of\nthem should at last be laid in Trom\u00c3\u00b6 churchyard?\n\nThese thoughts, having been once roused, would not be repressed again.\nThey held possession of her during the following day too; and she could\nsettle down to no work of any kind. She dreaded that Salv\u00c3\u00a9 might\nunexpectedly return, and did not know how she should receive him,--she\nno longer felt sure of being able to control herself. Her own house had\nall of a sudden become confined and suffocating, as if it were a prison\nin which she had sat for years: it seemed as if she could bear this way\nof living no longer.\n\nOn one of the following days a neighbour came in with a message from her\naunt. She was ill, and wished Elizabeth to come and see her.\n\nLeaving word, accordingly, for Salv\u00c3\u00a9 when he returned, where she was\ngone, she took Henrik with her, and set out at once for Arendal. It was\nalmost a relief to think that she would be away this time when he came\nhome.\n\nThat old Mother Kirstine should be laid up, was, in its way, an event in\nthe place. Having been professed sick-nurse for so many years, she was\nconnected by ties of grateful recollection with a number of families.\nMen who were now fathers themselves remembered well her face bending\nover them when as children they had tossed about in measles or fever;\nand when any more serious illness now occurred in any of their\nhouseholds, she appeared upon the scene as a matter of course without\nwaiting to be sent for. And it was a comfort in itself to see that\nstrong, self-possessed old woman, with her quiet experienced tact and\nuntiring faculty of keeping awake, moving about the sick-bed, and giving\nher directions with a confidence that brooked no contradiction. Her\nposition, in fact, was such, that when a new doctor arrived he soon\nperceived that the first thing he had to do, if he was to have any\nreputation in the town, would be to win the confidence of old Mother\nKirstine.\n\nYoung Fru Beck, amongst others, had constantly sent to inquire after\nher; and when she heard that Elizabeth was there, she could not resist\nthe opportunity of going to see her.\n\nIt was one evening before dinner--Mother Kirstine had fallen into a\nquiet sleep, and Elizabeth was sitting by her bedside, when she saw Fru\nBeck pass the window. Elizabeth knew she would come in, and sat with\nbeating heart waiting for her knock at the door.\n\nFru Beck must have stood a long while in the porch, for some minutes\npassed before the latch was stirred. Elizabeth went softly out and\nopened the door.\n\nThey stood face to face. Elizabeth's eyes were full of tears, but Fru\nBeck's feelings were not at that moment so easily expressed. She\nsilently pressed Elizabeth's hand, and her manner, and the expression of\nher pale face, showed that she was not the less moved of the two at\ntheir meeting again.\n\nElizabeth showed her into Mother Kirstine's comfortable little kitchen,\nwhere a saucepan of broth for her sick aunt was simmering over the fire.\nShe invited her visitor to take a seat. It was so quiet that they could\nhear the watch ticking in the next room where her aunt was sleeping.\n\nNeither spoke for a moment or two. Then Fru Beck asked in a low voice--\n\n\"How is your aunt, Elizabeth?\"\n\nIt was a natural question to ask under the circumstances, but it was\nfelt by both to be only a preliminary breaking of the ice; she had,\nbesides, sent a messenger that morning already to make inquiries.\n\n\"Thank you, Fru Beck, she is improving,\" Elizabeth replied. \"She is\nasleep now, and that will do her good.\"\n\n\"It is a long time since we saw each other--nearly eighteen years,\" said\nFru Beck, and her eyes dwelt upon Elizabeth as if to find what traces\ntime had left upon her. \"But you have kept strong, I see--stronger than\nI have.\"\n\n\"It was that morning I left for Holland,\" said Elizabeth, seeming to\nrecall it with a certain pleasure.\n\n\"I have often thought of that time,\" whispered Fru Beck, more to herself\nalmost than to the person she was talking to. Her lip trembled slightly,\nand Elizabeth read an expression of mute sorrow in her face. She was on\nthe point of telling Elizabeth that she knew the reason of her going;\nbut after debating for a moment within herself whether she should or\nnot, finally let it pass.\n\n\"Ah! if we could only see into the future, Elizabeth!\" she exclaimed\nwith a sigh, and looked sadly at her, as if she thought she had given\nexpression to a feeling that must be common to them both.\n\n\"It is better as it is, Fru Beck. Many things happen in life that would\nnot be so easy to bear if we were cast down beforehand.\"\n\n\"Yes; but one could guard one's self,\" whispered Fru Beck, with a\ncertain bitterness and hardness in her voice.\n\nElizabeth made no reply, and there was a pause, which seemed to Fru Beck\nto have broken the thread of the conversation. She deliberated how she\nshould take it up again so as to get at what she wanted to say, and\ntaking Elizabeth's hand with sudden warmth, she said--\n\n\"If there is anything your aunt wants, you know, I hope, that she has\nonly to send to me.\" She would rather have made Elizabeth herself the\nobject of her interest instead of her aunt, but felt that there was much\nin the relations in which they had stood to one another to make that\nimpossible; but her meaning was just as clear.\n\n\"And for yourself, Elizabeth?\" she went on, looking searchingly into her\neyes, with an expression of deep sympathy. \"All is not right with you: I\nam afraid your marriage has not been a happy one.\"\n\nThese last words brought a sudden flush into Elizabeth's face, and she\ninvoluntarily withdrew her hand.\n\nShe looked at Fru Beck with an expression of wounded pride, as if it was\na subject she declined to discuss.\n\n\"That is not the case, Fru Beck,\" she replied. \"I am\"--she was going to\nsay \"happily,\" but preferred to say--\"not unhappily married.\" She felt\nthat that sounded rather weak, and added--\n\n\"I have never loved, never wished for, any one but him who is now my\nhusband.\"\n\n\"I am overjoyed to hear it, Elizabeth, for I had heard otherwise,\" said\nFru Beck, with some embarrassment--and there was another pause. She felt\nfrom Elizabeth's manner and bearing that she had wounded her\nself-esteem; and this last unlucky speech, she was afraid, had made\nmatters worse.\n\nThere was a movement in the adjoining room, and Elizabeth was glad of an\noccasion to break the rather painful silence, and went in to her aunt\nfor a moment.\n\nFru Beck looked after her with a rather surprised, but an unsatisfied,\nexpression; she must have been mistaken: but still, happy in her home\nElizabeth could scarcely be. And yet, she thought bitterly, what a gulf\nthere was between them! She, at all events, loved her husband.\n\nWhen Elizabeth returned, Fru Beck, with the idea of effacing the\nimpression she had already produced, and to satisfy, at the same time,\nher own longing to open her heart to somebody, said--\n\n\"You must not be offended at what I said, Elizabeth. I thought that\nothers might have sorrow too.\"\n\n\"We all have our burden, and often it is very hard to bear,\" rejoined\nElizabeth. She understood very well what Fru Beck's words had meant, and\nlooked at her compassionately; but she avoided answering directly to\nwhat she thought had been blurted out unintentionally, and said--\n\n\"You have a son. That should be a great happiness, Fru Beck, and much to\nlive for.\"\n\n\"To live for!\" she exclaimed--\"to live for! I will confide to you\nsomething that no one but you now knows. I am dying--dying every day. No\none knows as well as I do myself how much is left of me. It is little,\nand it will soon be less.\" She spoke in a cold, pale kind of ecstasy.\n\"You are the only creature I have told this to--the only one on this\nearth I really care about; hear it and forget it. And now, adieu,\" she\nsaid; \"if we ever meet again in this world, don't let the subject be\nmentioned between us.\" She felt blindly for the door, and opened it.\n\n\"Every cross comes from above, and the worst of all sins is to despair,\"\nsaid Elizabeth, with an attempt at consolation; she said what most\nreadily occurred to her at the moment.\n\nFru Beck turned at the door, and looked back at her with a white, calm,\njoyless face.\n\n\"Elizabeth,\" she said, \"I found this in one of my husband's drawers. I\ntell it you, that you may not think that that has been in any way the\ncause of my spoilt life.\"\n\nShe took from her pocket a scrap of paper, yellow with age, and handed\nit to her. The door closed behind her then, and she was gone.\n\nElizabeth sat still for a long while in sad distress, thinking of her.\nNow she understood why Fru Beck was so pale. She had not a wrinkle in\nher face--it looked so noble; but oh how cold, how pinched it had\nbecome! Poor, poor woman! her burden was indeed a heavy one. It would\nhave been difficult to recognise Marie Forstberg again in her.\n\n\"That, then, it is to have married unhappily,\" she said to herself. She\nseemed to have gazed into some terrible abyss.\n\nHer friend's sorrows continued to occupy her thoughts as she sat by her\naunt's bedside; and when at last her feelings of compassion had calmed\ndown, another point in their conversation that had been hitherto thrown\ninto the background came into increasing prominence. It lay in the words\nthat had so suddenly and grievously wounded her.\n\n\"So, that is what the world says of us,\" she thought: \"that our marriage\nhas been unhappy.\"\n\nShe had time and solitude enough, while tending her patient and sitting\nup with her, to ponder the matter; and as she thought over her married\nlife, and contemplated unflinchingly the constant, weary, fruitless\nstruggle in which it had passed, and in which she had not advanced one\nsingle step, but rather had been going always, always back, more and\nmore, she asked herself, could she say that there was happiness in a\nlife like that? And was Salv\u00c3\u00a9 himself happy? She saw him before her as\nhe was in his early youth, and as he was now--gloomy, savage, and\nsuspicious in his home; she thought how she welcomed him always with\ndisguised dread instead of with a wife's joy, how they had last parted,\nand what feelings she had since entertained; and she dwelt long and\nbitterly upon the contrast. To think that it should have come to this\nbetween them! She began with dread to reflect, \"Perhaps this is what\nthey mean by an unhappy marriage.\" It had never occurred to her before\nthat such a thing could be said of her--of her, who had married the man\nwhom of all others in the whole world she wished to marry.\n\nShe sat on far into the night with her hands folded on her knee, and\ngazing straight before her, the night-light from the glass behind the\nbed throwing its faint light over the room. Fru Beck's words, as she\nstood there so pale, and told her of her unhappiness, recurred to her\nagain and again, more distinctly, it seemed, each time. \"I am dying\nevery day. I know best myself how much is left of me. It is very little,\nand will soon be less.\"\n\nIt seemed then all in a moment to flash upon her--\n\n\"That is just how Salv\u00c3\u00a9 and I are living. We are wasting away--we are\ndying every day beside each other. That is what people do who are\nunhappily married.\"\n\nShe sat for a long while, with her head bent forward, sorrowfully\nengrossed with this thought. In all the self-sacrifice she had\npractised, because she thought he could not bear to hear the truth, she\nsaw now nothing but one long corroding lie. It was owing to the want of\nconfidence in each other, of mutual candour--to their both having\nshunned the truth, the only sure ground of happiness, that their life\ntogether had been thus spoilt. She threw back her head with a look of\nwild energy in her face, and never had she looked more handsome than\nnow, as she exclaimed decisively--\n\n\"But there shall be an end of this! Salv\u00c3\u00a9 and I shall no longer make a\ndesert of each other's life!\" and she rose from her chair in great\nagitation.\n\n\"What are you saying, Elizabeth?\" asked her aunt, whom she had\nunconsciously awakened.\n\n\"Nothing, dear aunt,\" she answered, and bent over the invalid with a cup\nof broth, which she had been keeping warm over the night-light.\n\n\"You look so--so happy, Elizabeth.\"\n\n\"It is because you have slept so well, aunt; and if you drink this you\nwill go to sleep again.\"\n\nThere was a quiet smile on her lips now, and her whole bearing was\nchanged. The burden of years was taken off her heart. At last the\nchilling, heavy, bewildering fog which had enclosed her whole life,\nmaking every footstep, every thought, every joy uncertain, had lifted,\nand she could clearly see her way.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 had been lucky; he had piloted an English bark into Hesnaes, and\nhis services had been liberally acknowledged. He had, as usual, looked\nforward with dread to coming home again; but when he found his wife not\nthere, and heard the reason, he had set off at once for Arendal to see\nafter her.\n\nShe received him out in the passage.\n\n\"Good morning, Salv\u00c3\u00a9,\" she said, shaking hands with him. \"I have been\nanxious about you, as you may suppose, and have been expecting you. You\nmustn't make a noise--come this way,\" and she showed him into the room\nat the side. \"Where is Gjert?\"\n\nHe looked at her in surprise; this was not her usual way of receiving\nhim. There was a confidence in her tone, as if she had taken upon\nherself to call him to account for his absence. It had hitherto been he\nalways who had taken the initiative and been in a gracious humour or\nnot, according as it pleased him.\n\n\"Gjert,\" he answered, rather shortly, \"is at home in the house. So you\nhave been anxious about me--expected me?\" he added, in a peculiar tone,\nas if he found something to remark upon in this way of addressing him,\nbut deferred comment for the present.\n\n\"Why, you know, goodman, that it can't be the same to me if you are lost\nout there at sea.\"\n\n\"How is your aunt?\" he asked, abruptly. \"Is she seriously ill?\"\n\n\"She can see you. Come in with me, but step gently.\"\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 felt that he could not very well refuse, and followed her. He had\nalways, as far as possible, avoided seeing Mother Kirstine, and had left\nhis wife to represent him in that quarter. He was afraid of the\npenetrating eyes which the old woman turned upon him, and had never\nforgotten the warning she had given him not to go near Elizabeth as long\nas he harboured a doubt against her in his heart.\n\nIt was with great deference that he now approached her bedside.\n\n\"Oh, it's you, Salv\u00c3\u00a9,\" she said, in a weak voice. \"It's not often I have\na sight of you. Elizabeth has been such a blessing to me; and Henrik is\nso quiet and good. Where is Gjert? Have you not brought him with you?\"\nAnd her eyes wandered in search of the boy.\n\n\"He is at home taking care of the house, aunt. How are you?\"\n\n\"Oh, thanks--as you see. I think so often what will become of that boy;\nhe is so wild, but with such a good nature, poor fellow!\"\n\n\"Oh, we shall make something of him, you'll see,\" said Elizabeth, who\nhad been standing behind Salv\u00c3\u00a9, and now came forward. \"But you must not\ntalk so much.\"\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9's face grew stern; this was the most unfortunate topic which could\nhave been suggested. And matters were presently made worse by Mother\nKirstine saying, when there was a pause--\n\n\"You looked so glad last night, Elizabeth! Who was it that was sitting\nwith you talking yesterday?\"\n\n\"It was Fru Beck.\"\n\n\"The young one?\"\n\n\"Yes. But you talk too much, aunt.\"\n\n\"I am afraid so too,\" thought Salv\u00c3\u00a9; and as he saw Elizabeth, as if\nnothing had happened, motioning to him now to come away, he controlled\nhimself for the moment, and said a little constrainedly--\n\n\"You will be quite well, aunt, I hope, by the time I come again perhaps\nin a few days. Good-bye till then.\"\n\nHe left the room rather brusquely, and his face was black as thunder.\n\nElizabeth read his thoughts, and when they came out into the kitchen she\nforestalled him.\n\n\"Listen, Salv\u00c3\u00a9,\" she said; \"I must, of course, stay here as long as aunt\nis ill.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he replied; \"and you have acquaintances here.\"\n\n\"You mean Fru Beck? Yes, she has been so kind to me, and I am attached\nto her--she is unhappily married, poor thing!\"\n\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9 was astounded. Elizabeth seemed all in a moment to have forgotten\na great deal--to have forgotten that there existed certain\nstumbling-blocks between them--was it perhaps because she was in her\naunt's house? He looked coldly at her as if he could not quite\ncomprehend what had come over her.\n\n\"You will remain, of course, as long as you please,\" he said, and\nprepared to go; but could not help adding with bitterness--\n\n\"I daresay you find it lonely and dull at home.\"\n\n\"You are not so far wrong there, Salv\u00c3\u00a9,\" she replied. \"I have indeed\nfound it lonely enough out there for many years now. You are so often\naway from home, and then I am left quite alone. It is two years now\nsince I have been in here to see my aunt.\"\n\n\"Elizabeth,\" he burst out, trying hard to restrain himself, \"have you\ntaken leave of your senses?\"\n\n\"That is just what I want to avoid, Salv\u00c3\u00a9,\" she said, with freezing\ndeliberation.\n\nHe stared at her. She could stand and tell him this to his face!\n\n\"So these are your sentiments, then,\" he observed, scornfully. \"I always\nsuspected it; and now, for what I care, you may please yourself about\ncoming home, Elizabeth,\" he continued in a cold, indifferent tone.\n\n\"You ought always to have known what my sentiments were, Salv\u00c3\u00a9; that I\nwas, perhaps, too much attached to you.\"\n\n\"I shall send you money. You shall not have that as an excuse. So far as\nI am concerned, you may enjoy the society of Fru Beck and your fine\nfriends as long as ever you please.\"\n\n\"And why should I not be allowed to speak to Fru Beck?\" she cried, with\nher head thrown back, and with an expression of rising anger. \"You don't\nmean, I suppose, that there is anything against me that should prevent\nmy entering her house? But there must be an end to this, Salv\u00c3\u00a9--and it\nis for the sake of our love I say it; for if matters go on as they have\nbeen going on so long between us,\" she concluded slowly, and with a\ntremor in her voice, \"you might live to see the day when it had ceased\nto exist. These things are not in our own power, Salv\u00c3\u00a9.\"\n\nHe stood for a moment still, and gazed at her in speechless amazement,\nwhile the flash of his dark keen eyes showed that a devil had been\nroused within him, which he had the utmost difficulty in restraining.\n\n\"I will suppose that you have said this in a moment of excitement,\" he\nsaid, with terrible calmness; \"I shall not be angry with you--I shall\nforget it; I promise you that. And I think that you have not been quite\nyourself to-day--ill--\"\n\n\"Don't deceive yourself, Salv\u00c3\u00a9. I mean every word--as surely as I love\nyou.\"\n\n\"Farewell, Elizabeth; I shall be here again on Wednesday,\" he said, as\nif he only held to his purpose, and did not care to hear any more of\nthis. He left her then, and shut the door quietly behind him.\n\nWhen he had gone, Elizabeth sank rather than sat down upon the bench.\nShe was frightened at what she had said. A profound dread took\npossession of her. She knew his nature so well, and knew that she was\nrisking everything, that the result might be that he would leave her\naltogether, and take to some misguided life far away from home. And yet\nit must--it must be dared. And with God's help she would conquer, and\nbind him to her closer than ever he had been before.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\n\nAs Salv\u00c3\u00a9 stood and steered for home, he had as yet only a dull\nconsciousness of what had occurred; but there was anger in his eye, and\na hard determined look in his face. His pride had received a terrible\nshock. She had suddenly fallen upon him with all this on neutral ground;\nshe had told him plainly that she had been unhappy, and that she felt\nshe had been living under a tyranny the whole time of their married\nlife. He smiled bitterly--well, he had been right, it seemed, all along\nin feeling that she was not open with him.\n\nYes, it was true that they had lived unhappily; but whose fault had it\nbeen? Had she not deceived him when he was young and confiding, and did\nnot know what doubt was? And since?--he knew but too well what it had\ncost her to adapt herself to his humble circumstances.\n\nHe felt that the power which he had had over her for so many years was\ngone. It was as if she had all of a sudden set down a barrel of\ngunpowder on the floor of his house and threatened to blow it up. Such\nthreats, however, would have no weight with him.\n\nWhen he came to Merd\u00c3\u00b6 he moored the cutter in silence--scarcely looking\nat Gjert, who came down to help him--and went in, without speaking, to\nthe house, where he stood by the window for a while writing on the\nwindow-pane. It was soon quite dark outside; Gjert had lit a candle, and\nhad sat down by the table. He understood that there was something wrong\nagain with his mother, but did not dare to ask after her, as he was\nlonging to do. His father, during the rest of the evening, never stirred\nfrom the corner of the bench which was his son's sleeping-place; it was\nmade to serve the double purpose of bench and bed.\n\nWhen supper-time arrived, Gjert put some food on the table. He felt that\nthe situation somehow was dangerous, and went on his tiptoes to make as\nlittle noise as possible; but he was the more awkward in consequence,\nand made a clatter with the plates.\n\nThis, and the dread of him which his son showed, irritated Salv\u00c3\u00a9. He\nflared up suddenly, and burst out in a thundering voice--\n\n\"Don't you ask after your mother, boy?\"\n\nGjert would have been frightened under ordinary circumstances, but his\nanxiety for his mother, for whom his heart bled, gave him courage to\nanswer boldly--\n\n\"Yes, father; I have been wanting all the time to ask how mother was. Is\nshe not coming? Poor mother!\" and the boy burst into tears, laid his\nhead upon his arm, and sobbed.\n\n\"Mother will come back when her aunt over in Arendal is well again,\"\nsaid the pilot, soothingly. But he soon broke out again.\n\n\"You have nothing to blubber for,\" he said; \"you can go in and see her\nif you like t-omorrow morning the first thing. You may go now and sleep\nin our bed.\"\n\nGjert obeyed; and his father paced to and fro on the floor afterwards\nfor a long while in great agitation.\n\n\"That is her game, then, is it?\" he exclaimed. \"She knew what she was\nabout, and she knew who it was she was threatening.\"\n\nHe sat down again on the bench-bed with clasped hands, and eyes fixed on\nthe ground. Passion was working strongly within him.\n\n\"But she does not put compulsion upon me.\"\n\nThe candle was expiring in the socket, and he lit another and put it in\nits place. It was past midnight. He remained for a little with the\ncandlestick in his hand, and then took the light in to Gjert. The boy\nwas lying in his mother's place, and had evidently cried himself to\nsleep.\n\nHis father stood for a long while over him. His lips quivered, and his\nface became ashy pale. He controlled himself with an effort and went\nback to the other room, where he sat down in the same attitude as\nbefore.\n\nWhen Gjert came in in the morning, he found his father lying down on the\nbench with all his clothes on. He was asleep. It was evident that he had\nsat up the whole night. It went to the boy's heart; and he felt sorry\nfor his father now.\n\nThe latter woke shortly after and looked at him rather confusedly at\nfirst. Then he said, gently--\n\n\"I promised you yesterday, my boy, that you should go to your mother in\nArendal. I daresay she is wanting to see you.\"\n\n\"If mother is not ill I had rather stay here with you, father, until you\ngo in to see her yourself. She has Henrik with her.\"\n\n\"You would?\" said his father, in a rather toneless voice, and looking at\nhim as if some new idea had been suggested to him by the boy's reply.\n\n\"But I wish you to go, Gjert,\" he said then, suddenly, in a changed\ntone, that admitted of no further question. \"Mother took no things with\nher. You must take her Sunday gown, and what else you know she will\nwant, in with you in the trunk there. It may be a long while\nbefore--before aunt is well,\" he said, and left the house.\n\nWhile Gjert packed up the things, his father went down to the strand and\ngot the row-boat ready himself for him.\n\nWhen the boy started he stroked the child's cheek, but said a little\nbitterly, \"Remember me to your mother now, and say that father is\ncoming, as he promised, on Wednesday. Be careful, now, how you go. I\nhave only given you the oars; I don't like to trust you with a sail in\nthe boat.\"\n\nHe stood for some time looking after his son as he rowed sturdily away,\nand then went up to the look-out, where he began to walk up and down\nwith his hands behind his back in his usual manner. His restlessness of\nmind, however, soon drove him back again to the house, where he remained\nalone nearly the whole day.\n\nThe first intensity of his anger had so far worked itself off now, that\nhe could think clearly; and the chief feeling which possessed him was\none of wonder as to what could have come over her all of a sudden like\nthis. It could hardly be that scene which they had had when he last went\nto sea--it had not been the first of its kind. No--it must be something\nelse; it must have been something which had occurred in Arendal. She had\nspoken of Fru Beck's unhappy married life with a certain significance,\nas if it bore upon their own. That was evidently it--she had been\ntalking to Fru Beck; she must have been put up to it by her old friend.\n\n\"What gratitude I do owe these Becks!\" he exclaimed; \"it seems as if\nevery trouble must come from that owl's nest.\"\n\n\"She has gone and thought all this at home here, concealing it from me\nthe whole time, submitting, and saying nothing. Now she has found her\nopportunity. And over there, in Arendal, she could, of course, count\nupon being able to make her own terms against her husband, the unpopular\npilot--could be sure of having every one on her side, from her aunt to\nthese same Becks.\"\n\nYes; and what was the real history of her connection with the Becks? He\nhad never had that matter satisfactorily cleared up.\n\n\"She stipulated that I should trust her--wouldn't hear mention of a\ndoubt. But I have never felt satisfied about that business.\"\n\n\"I'll not be fooled by you any longer,\" he cried then, flying into a\nsudden passion, and striding up and down the room. \"It is she who must\ngive me an explanation; it is she who has trampled me under foot!\"\n\nHe sat down at the table and pursued this train of thought.\n\n\"Elizabeth! Elizabeth! what have you done?\" he whispered, presently,\nwith emotion, and hid his forehead in his hands.\n\n\"Yes, what has she done? Nothing, I firmly believe; and that it is just\nyou, Salv\u00c3\u00a9, who are mad! Ah! if I could only really believe that there\nwas nothing to quarrel about, after all! And I can believe it, if I have\nonly been with her for a while,\" he sighed; and then added with a touch\nof self-contempt, \"the fact is, I ought never to go away from home. I am\nlike an anchovy; I don't bear taking out of the jar!\n\n\"She was so like the old Elizabeth as she stood there and told me all\nthis; it is years since I have seen her like that. There's not her match\nto be found the whole world through.\n\n\"She has told me so often that she cares for me, has always cared for\nme, ever since the time she was living with her grandfather out on the\nrock; and an untruth never came from her lips. I'd stake my life upon\nthat.\n\n\"For truth--I believe you, Elizabeth, when you stand like that and tell\nme so,\" and he struck the table as if he was making the declaration to\nher face.\n\n\"But why should she care for me?\" he went on. \"Have her thoughts not\nbeen running always on things much beyond what I, a poor pilot, and my\nhumble cottage can give her? Has she not always been hankering after\nsomething grand?\"\n\nDuring these days, while this conflict of thought was surging to and fro\nwithin him, he had the appearance of a man distraught; and if he ever\nleft the house, he could not rest until he had returned to it again. The\nprolonged agitation of mind had told upon him, and he was sitting\nnow--the day before the one when he was to go in to Arendal again--alone\nin his house, feeling very low and depressed; it looked so dreary and\nempty.\n\nOver in the window, by the leaf-table, where she generally sat to sew,\nstood the polished buffalo-hoof which he had brought long ago as a\ncuriosity from Monte Video, and had since had made into a weight for\nher; and by the wall, under the old print of the Naiad, was the\nelephant, carved out of bone, which he had also had from the time when\nhe was roaming through the world as a sailor before the mast.\n\nHe gazed at these things for a while absently, and then went in to their\nbedroom.\n\nThere was the chest of drawers by the wall, on which she always placed\nthe lacquered glass which hung in the other room, when she arranged her\nbeautiful hair. How many a conversation they had had together as she\nstood there with her back to him; and what a figure she had! often\nanswering him with merely a change of expression as she looked back at\nhim over her shoulder. Everything in the room had some such vivid memory\nto suggest; and as he sat dismally on the side of their bed, adjoining\nwhich was little Henrik's, his thoughts were occupied with many a\ntrivial recollection of the kind, which might seem almost childish in a\nman of his age and character, and of such a stern, black-bearded\nexterior; but he was anything but stern now.\n\nPresently his eyes ceased to wander. He sat perfectly still. The\nconviction had seized him that he could not possibly do without her; and\nas he looked slowly about him a great terror seemed to be taking\npossession of him. He imagined that she was really gone--that in some\nway or another he had really lost her, and that everything in the room\nwas standing just as she had left it, and as it would stand unmoved,\nundusted for ever.\n\n\"I have deserved it,\" he muttered; and a cold perspiration came out upon\nhis forehead. \"Have I treated her in such a way that I have any right to\nexpect her to care for me? Is it not just my own folly that is to blame?\nShe was right--more than right. I have behaved shamefully to her,\nsuspiciously, and tyrannically--invariably, unceasingly; and now I may\nsit here long enough and repent it, to no purpose. She would not be what\nshe is if she tamely submitted to such treatment.\"\n\nHe dwelt upon this last thought until the scales seemed to drop from his\neyes, and, acknowledging the truth at last, he broke out with bitter\nscorn against himself--\n\n\"The fact is, in my cursed pride I have never been able to bear the\nthought that she might have been better off--that I was not good enough\nfor her, not fit for her; that is what has been at the bottom of it all:\nand as I would not acknowledge that, I have insisted always to myself\nthat I could not trust her.\n\n\"Do I really believe this?\" he asked himself then slowly, and fell into\nthought again, his face growing darker and darker every minute.\n\n\"What a good-natured booby, fool, idiot, I am!\" he cried, with a\nscornful laugh. \"No, it is she who has been false and untruthful, she\nwho must acknowledge it, she who is bound to give me, once for all, full\nexplanation. Yes, it is she who must bend, and then she may have some\nclaim to hear from me what I too may have to reproach myself for in my\nacts or bearing towards her. That is how it is, and that is how it shall\nbe!\"\n\nA hard, inexorable look overspread his face as he said this; but for a\nmoment he appeared almost moved again--\n\n\"I shall speak kindly to her--be so gentle--forget everything.\n\n\"But bend she shall,\" he added; and that decision was evidently final.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\n\nThat evening was passed by Elizabeth in a terrible struggle with\nherself. When Gjert had brought her clothes she had turned very pale,\nand had felt as if she had undertaken what she would not have strength\nto carry through. And now that the decisive moment had nearly come, this\nfeeling increased almost to despair.\n\nThey had all gone to bed in the house. It was so quiet about her; and a\nfeeling came over her such as she had experienced that time on the\nApollo, as she sat and waited whilst they approached the sandbanks.\nEarly next morning the crisis would inevitably come; and it was a\nquestion now of losing more than the brig--of losing all they jointly\npossessed on earth! She saw a long, dreary life-strand stretching away\nbeyond.\n\nThis time it was she who was at the helm, and steering a desperate\ncourse--to save her love. A solemn look came over her face. The prayer\nfor seamen in danger, which she had so often used when the gusts were\nshaking the house out there on Merd\u00c3\u00b6, and she sat waiting for him in her\nsolitary home, came into her head now--the prayer that God might save\nhim from a sudden death.\n\nA sudden death!\n\nIf he really had been lost on one of those many occasions when he had\nparted from her with bitterness and anger in his heart! Would her love\nthen have been a blessing to him?\n\n\"No, Salv\u00c3\u00a9!\" she cried; \"you shall not have me to thank for such a life\nin your last hour!\"\n\nIn the night she awoke with a scream. She had dreamt that Salv\u00c3\u00a9 was\ngoing to leave her for ever, and she cried frantically after him,\n\"Salv\u00c3\u00a9! Salv\u00c3\u00a9!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\n\nHis two sons were waiting for him when the pilot came up to the jetty\nnext morning. Little Henrik had begun to shout to him gleefully while he\nwas still some way off; but Gjert was quiet. He had seen enough to feel\nthat there must be something serious the matter between his parents, and\nhe was depressed.\n\n\"Good morning, boys!\" said their father, kindly; \"how is your--aunt?\"\n\n\"Better,\" replied Gjert.\n\n\"She sleeps in the daytime, too,\" added the \"bagman,\" triumphantly--he\nhad discovered that this was what was required to make her well again.\nHe then threw his cap down on the stones with a great sailor air, and\nwith an eager \"hale-hoi--o--ohoi!\" began to haul in the shore-rope which\nhis father had thrown, while Gjert, paying no attention whatever to his\nbrother's efforts, made it fast to the mooring-ring.\n\n\"That's good lads! Stay here now, both of you, by the boat, and look\nafter her till I come back,\" said their father. \"See, Gjert, that Henrik\ndoesn't leave the quay.\"\n\nHe left them then, and went rapidly up the street.\n\nElizabeth was standing by the hearth expecting him; and something of a\nSunday calm seemed to have come over her as she stood there. She heard\nhim out in the passage; and when he entered, a rapid flush passed over\nher fine features, but it disappeared again immediately, and she stared\nat him with half-open lips, forgetting to greet him. At the same time,\nthere was a conscious self-possession in her bearing which did not\nescape him. That was the Elizabeth he loved.\n\nHe came to the point at once; and looking her full in the face, began\nwith great earnestness--\"Elizabeth, I have a serious accusation to make\nagainst you. You have not been frank towards me--you have disguised your\nreal feelings from me for many years, I am afraid during the whole time\nwe have lived together.\"\n\nHe spoke gently, and as though he had no desire to press the charge, but\nmerely waited to hear her make a full acknowledgment before he forgave\nher. She stood, however, without raising her eyes from the ground, her\nface pale, and her bosom heaving.\n\n\"And yet how I have loved you, Elizabeth!--more dearly than my life,\" he\nadded.\n\nShe still remained for a moment silent, and had to summon all her\ncourage now to speak. At last she said, in a rather strained voice, and\nwithout lifting her eyes--\n\n\"I hear you say it, Salv\u00c3\u00a9. But I have been thinking a good deal lately.\"\n\n\"You have been thinking, Elizabeth?\" he repeated, \"what have you been\nthinking?\" and his expression changed in a moment to the dark, stern one\nshe knew so well. He had made his advance; further he would not go.\n\n\"Am I right, or am I not?\" he asked, sharply.\n\n\"No, Salv\u00c3\u00a9, you are not right,\" she replied, turning to him now with a\nlook that seemed fired by all she had endured; \"you are not right. It is\nyourself, and yourself only, you have loved all along; and when you took\nme as your wife, you merely took another to help you. There were two\nabout it then, and even so it was not enough. No! no!\" she cried,\nstriking out her hand with an emphatic gesture in the bitterness of her\nfeeling--\"if you had loved me as I have loved you, we would not be\nstanding before one another as we are this day!\"\n\nHe was taken aback for a moment by this unexpected outburst, but replied\nin a cold hard voice, while his eyes never moved from her face, \"I thank\nyou, Elizabeth, for having at last told me your thoughts, though it\ncomes a little late. You see I was right when I said that you had not\nbeen frank towards me.\"\n\n\"I have not been frank with you, you say? Yes, that is true,\" she\nrejoined, while her eye met his unflinchingly. \"And it is to my honour.\nI have submitted to be an object of suspicion in my own house. I have\nshut my eyes and persisted in believing that you cared for me, in spite\nof the heavier burden which you were every day imposing upon me--in\nspite of all that I have had to endure--and it has been much, very much,\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9,--and I have done all this because I believed it was my duty, and\nbecause I thought you could not bear to hear the truth, and because I\nhoped that I might conquer in the end, and make you really love me as I\nhave all along, and but too well, loved you, Salv\u00c3\u00a9. It is true that I\nhave not been frank with you. And, I repeat, it is to my honour.\"\n\nThis interpretation of their relations together was not one which he\nchose to accept, and he rejoined in the same hard tone as before--\n\n\"However cleverly you may have tried to conceal it, Elizabeth, it has\nalways been but too evident to me what you have endured in trying to\naccommodate yourself to the humble circumstances of a man like me. I\nknow as well as you that a common seaman was little suited to be your\nhusband--I have always known it from the time we were first engaged,\nwhen we stood before Van Spyck's portrait in Amsterdam. That was the\nsort of man, I knew very well, whom you ought to have had for a husband.\nI saw it again, as I have seen it always, when you made comparisons\nbetween the North Star and my poor brig--\"\n\n\"Salv\u00c3\u00a9!\" she exclaimed, passionately, unable to control herself any\nlonger--\"what rubbish are you talking? Do you not know perfectly well\nthat if you had been an admiral itself you never would have been greater\nin my eyes than you are now, and always have been as a simple pilot? And\npray, whom was I thinking of when I was looking at Van Spyck? why, of\nwhom but of you?--thinking that the man called Salv\u00c3\u00a9 Kristiansen, who\nstood behind me, was just the one to have done what Van Spyck did. Or\nwhen I was admiring the North Star was I not thinking then too: If you,\nSalv\u00c3\u00a9, were in command of her, they would see what she could really do\nwith a proper man on board? What possible interest do you suppose I\ncould have in the North Star, except in connection with you? Were not\nyou, poor skipper of the Apollo, worth more, a thousand times more to\nme, than a hundred North Stars with all their bravery?\"\n\nWhen she spoke like this it was impossible not to believe every single\nword of what she said, and Salv\u00c3\u00a9's expression while she had been\nspeaking had gradually changed to one of inexpressible happiness. So it\nwas really he, and he alone, who had been the hero of her life! and he\nstretched out his arms to her, as though, like Alcibiades of old, he\nwould end the discussion by clasping her to his heart and carrying her\nstraight off with him to his home. But he was arrested by the deep\nrepelling seriousness with which she continued--\n\n\"No, Salv\u00c3\u00a9!--it is not which that stands between us, however ingeniously\nyou may have discovered it--it is not that,--it is something else. It is\nthat you don't trust me in your heart; that is the truth--and that has\nbeen the real source of all these morbid ideas you have formed.\n\n\"And look you,\" she went on, with wild anguish in her voice, \"we shall\nnever get on together as long as you encourage the faintest suspicion of\nsuch thoughts; we shall never have peace beside our hearth--that peace\nthat I have been striving for all these years, when I have been\nsubmitting, as I did, to everything--in a way that you know well, Salv\u00c3\u00a9,\nwas very far from natural to me,\" and as she said this she looked with a\nmagnificent air at him; \"and if you cannot yet understand that--may God\nhelp you--and us!\" she ended in despair, and turning half away again to\nthe fire, stared dejectedly into it.\n\nHe stood before her half-averted form as if he had been paralysed, and\nscarcely dared to look up at her, with such truth had all that she had\nsaid come home to him. She had held a mirror up to their life together,\nand he saw himself in it so utterly selfish and so small by the side of\nall this love. He was profoundly pained and humbled, and was too\nnaturally truthful to wish not to acknowledge it.\n\nHe went absently to the window and stood there for a moment.\n\n\"Elizabeth,\" he said then, despondently, turning round, \"you still must\nknow in your heart that you have been everything in this world to me.\nBut I know where my great fault to you has been, and I'll tell it you\nnow, fully and freely, even if you must despise me for it. Yes,\nElizabeth, it is true I have never been able to feel absolutely certain\nthat I had full possession of your heart--though, God be praised, you\nhave taught me differently to-day--since that time,\"--it evidently cost\nhim a struggle to go on with the humiliating confession--\"since that\nbusiness between you and the lieutenant. That has been the thorn in my\nflesh,\" he said, gently, as if opening his inmost heart to her, \"which I\nhave not been able to get rid of, in spite of my better reason. And I\ndon't know but what it may still be there. There lies my weakness--I\ntell it you plainly and honestly; but at the same time I can't give you\nup, Elizabeth.\n\n\"I have always seen,\" he continued, \"that the proper husband for you\nwould have been a man who was something in the world--such a one as he,\nand not a man of no position like me. In my pride I never could bear the\nthought--and it is that that has made me so full of rancour against all\nthe world, and so suspicious and bad towards you. I have not been strong\nenough--not like you--but I can truly say I have struggled with my\nweakness, Elizabeth,\" he said, pale with intensity of feeling, and\nlaying both his hands on her shoulders, and looking into her face.\n\nShe felt that his arms were trembling, and her eyes filled with\ntears--it went to her heart to see him like this. All at once on a\nsudden thought she withdrew herself from his hands and went into the\nlittle room adjoining the one they were in, and opened a drawer there.\nShe came out with the old note in her hand and held it out to him--\n\n\"That is the letter I wrote to the lieutenant the night I left the\nBecks'.\"\n\nHe looked at her a little wonderingly.\n\n\"Fru Beck gave it to me,\" she said. \"Read it, Salv\u00c3\u00a9.\"\n\nHe looked at the large clumsy writing and spelt out--\n\n\"Forgive me that I cannot be your wife, for my heart is given to\nanother.--Elizabeth Raklev.\"\n\nHe sat down on the bench and read it over again, while she bent over\nhim, looking now at the writing, and now at his face.\n\n\"What do you find there, Salv\u00c3\u00a9?\" she asked. \"Why could I not be Beck's\nwife?\"\n\n\"'Because my heart is given to another,'\" he answered, slowly, and\nlooking up at her with moistened eyes.\n\n\"Not yours; it is I who loved another. And who was that other?\"\n\n\"God bless you--it was me!\" he said, and drew her down upon his knee\ninto a long, long embrace.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe boys had become tired of waiting down at the boat, the \"bagman\"\nespecially, since it was clearly past dinner-time; the bell had rung\nover at the dry-dock, and the town boys had already passed from school.\nHis white head and heated face appeared now at the kitchen-door, and\nwith scarcely a glance over to where his father and mother were sitting\non the bench together looking very happy, he turned at once to the\nhearth and became aware of the sad fact that there was positively no\nporridge to be seen; there was not even a fire. Coming bodily into the\nroom, he asked, with tears in his voice--\n\n\"Have you had dinner? Are Gjert and I not to have any, then?\"\n\nHis mother sprang up. \"And aunt!\" she exclaimed. \"I declare it is\nhalf-past one, and no dinner put down!\" Henrik was glad to find that the\nworst danger was over.\n\nMother Kirstine had conjectured that there must be something particular\ngoing on between the pair in the kitchen, and that was the reason she\nhad not called Elizabeth. When the latter now came in, she looked at her\ninquiringly, and asked if anything had happened.\n\n\"The happiest thing of my whole life, aunt,\" said Elizabeth, coming over\nto the bed and embracing her impetuously. She hurried back then to her\nbusiness in the kitchen.\n\nThe old woman looked after her, and nodded her head a couple of times\nslowly, thoughtfully. \"No--so?\"\n\n\"He is joking with little Henrik,\" she said then to herself. \"That is\nwonderful: I have never heard him laugh before.\"\n\nWhen they went to dinner in the kitchen Salv\u00c3\u00a9 left them--he was not\nhungry--and came in to her. He had a great deal to say, and was a long\nwhile away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\n\nIt was an afternoon in the following winter in the pilot's home. His\nwife was expecting him, and kept looking uneasily out of the window. He\nwas to have been home by noon, and it was now beginning to get dark; and\nthe weather had been stormy the whole of the previous day.\n\nShe gave up sewing, and sat thinking in the twilight, with the light\nplaying over the floor from the door of the stove, where a little kettle\nwas boiling, that she might have something warm ready for him at once\nwhen he came. It was too early to light a candle.\n\nGjert was at school in Arendal, living at his aunt's; and Henrik was\nsitting by the light from the stove, cutting up a piece of wood into\nshavings.\n\n\"It is beginning to blow again, Henrik,\" she said, and put a\nhandkerchief round her head to look out.\n\n\"It is no use, mother,\" he pronounced, without stirring, and splitting a\nlong peg into two against his chest; \"it's pitch-dark, isn't it?\" So she\ngave it up again before she got to the door, but stood and listened; she\nthought she had heard a shout outside.\n\n\"He is coming!\" she cried, suddenly, and darted out; and when Salv\u00c3\u00a9\nentered the porch from the sleet squall that had just come up, with his\nsou'wester and oilskin coat all dripping, he found himself, all wet as\nhe was, suddenly encircled in the dark by a pair of loving arms.\n\n\"How long you have been!\" she cried, taking from him what he had in his\nhands, and preceding him into the house, where she lit a candle. \"What\nhas kept you? I heard that you had taken a galliot up to Arendal\nyesterday, and thought you would have been here this morning. It was\ndreadful weather yesterday, Salv\u00c3\u00a9; so I was a little anxious,\" she\ncontinued, as she helped him off with his wet oilskin coverings.\n\n\"I have done well, Elizabeth,\" he said, looking pleased.\n\n\"On the galliot?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I had a little matter to arrange in Arendal, which kept me\nthere till after midday.\"\n\n\"You saw Gjert, then?\"\n\n\"I did.\" He looked a little impatiently towards the door.\n\n\"And he is well?\"\n\n\"He can tell you now, himself,\" was the reply, as the door at the moment\nopened and Gjert entered with a loud \"Good evening, mother!\"\n\nShe sprang towards him in astonishment, and threw her arms round him.\n\"And not a dry stitch on the whole boy!\" she cried, with motherly\nconcern.\n\n\"But, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 dear, what is the meaning of this? How can the boy come away\nfrom school?\"\n\n\"When we have changed our clothes and warmed ourselves a little, I'll\ntell you, mother,\" answered the pilot, slily. \"He will be at home with\nyou the whole week.\"\n\nGjert was evidently ready to burst with some news or other, but he had\nto restrain himself until his father had taken his seat by the fire that\nwas crackling brightly on the hearth in the kitchen, and had leisurely\nfilled his pipe, and taken two or three pulls at it.\n\n\"Now then, Gjert,\" he said, \"you may tell it. I see you can't keep it in\nany longer.\"\n\n\"Well, mother!\" he exclaimed, \"father says that I shall be an officer in\nthe navy; and so he has taken me from school and is going with me to\nFrederiksvoern next week.\"\n\nHenrik's mouth opened slowly, while Elizabeth, who was stirring the\nporridge, suspended that operation, and looked in something like alarm\nat her husband.\n\n\"What do you mean, Salv\u00c3\u00a9?\"\n\n\"Wouldn't it be a fine thing, don't you think, to see the boy come home\nto you some day in a smart uniform, Elizabeth? You have always had a\nturn for that sort of thing,\" he added, jokingly. \"And since you\ncouldn't go in for it yourself,--as they don't take womenfolk in the\nnavy--and it was not much in my line either,--why, I thought we could\nmake the experiment with Gjert.\"\n\n\"Are you really in earnest, Salv\u00c3\u00a9?\" she asked, looking at him still in\nsuspense.\n\nHe nodded in confirmation.\n\n\"Well, if it is your father's wish, may--may God prosper you in it, my\nboy!\" she said, going over to Gjert and stroking his forehead.\n\n\"So--now you may take your joiner's bench into the room again, Henrik;\nyou can talk with Gjert in there--that is to say, if he will condescend\nnow to answer a common man like you--tell him you will be a merchant\ncaptain, and earn as much as two such fellows in uniform. Mother and I\ncan then enjoy a little peace from you here in the kitchen.\"\n\nWhen they were alone, Elizabeth asked--\n\n\"But how has it all happened, Salv\u00c3\u00a9?\"\n\n\"Well, you see, I had taken the idea into my head about Gjert that he\nshould become something a little better than his father had been, and so\nI went up to the Master, to Beck, and asked what I must do to push the\nthing. Yes; and I spoke to young Fru Beck too.\"\n\n\"Salv\u00c3\u00a9! did you go to Beck?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did--the boy must be pushed; and into the bargain, I half begged\nhis pardon for the way I used to turn the rough edge of my tongue on\nhim--and so we were reconciled. He is a fine old fellow in reality, and\nI have wronged him. He said he had never forgotten that I had saved the\nJuno for him, and that he had intended to put me one day in command of\nher. While we were talking, young Fru Beck came in, and when she heard\nwhat we were speaking about, she showed the greatest interest at once.\nYou were an old friend of hers, she said; and she thought we might get\nGjert into the Institute there free, when he had been up for an\nexamination in the summer. She knew some of the officials who would be\nable to get it done; and if the Master wrote,\" he continued, a little\nconsciously, \"that I was neither more nor less than a remarkable pilot\nwho ought to be salaried by the State, the thing would be as good as\ndone. So the Master wrote the application for me there and then.\"\n\n\"See that!\" cried Elizabeth.\n\n\"Ay, and he wrote a testimonial from himself underneath. I hadn't an\nidea that I was such a fine fellow,\" he laughed.\n\n\"You see,\" she cried, looking at him proudly, \"it comes at last. He\nacknowledges it now.\"\n\n\"Well, if we don't manage the thing that way, Salv\u00c3\u00a9 Kristiansen will be\nable nevertheless to work it out of his own pocket--for worked it shall\nbe, mind you. It won't be done for nothing; but we have something in the\nsavings bank, and the rest will come right enough.\n\n\"It will be just as well that I should have something to drive me out of\nthe house occasionally, for otherwise I should get too fond both of it\nand of you, Elizabeth,\" he said, and drew her towards him. \"I must have\na little rain and storm now and again--it's my nature, you know. And the\nMaster must not be made to have written lies about me.\"\n\nHis wife looked at him. A glow of deep feeling overspread her handsome\nfeatures.\n\n\"How happy we have become, Salv\u00c3\u00a9!\" she exclaimed. \"If it could only have\nbeen like this from the very beginning!\"\n\n\"I have thought over that, Elizabeth,\" he said, seriously. \"There has\nbeen One at the helm who is cleverer than I, for there was a deal of bad\nstuff to be knocked out of me after I returned from that foreign life.\nYou, poor woman, were the chief sufferer by it, I am afraid.\"\n\n\"And it was I, Salv\u00c3\u00a9, who was the chief cause of it all,\" she replied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Pilot and his Wife, by Jonas Lie\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PILOT AND HIS WIFE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 15588-8.txt or 15588-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/5\/5\/8\/15588\/\n\nProduced by Clare Boothby, Jim Wiborg and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team.\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1403,"split":"test"}
