{"ori_id":"cb33226b57202434789eedc650ebca166a458dcc","title":"The Assembly of Gods","context":"The Assembly of Gods\n The Assembly of Gods is composed of 301 seven line stanzas which have the standard ababbcc rhyme pattern of the rhyme royal. The meter, as critics have noted, is irregular. The poem can be broken into five main sections: an introduction, three distinct but connected narrative episodes and a conclusion.\nIn the introduction, the poet establishes the setting using conventional astrological and geographical references which place the poem within the traditional framework of a dream poem and introduces the dreamer who sits \u201call solytary alone besyde a lake,\/ Musyng on a maner how that I myght make\/ Reason & Sensualyte in oon to acorde\u201d (1). But, before he can think through his puzzle he is overcome by sleep. Morpheus comes and escorts him to the court of Minos which is being held at the estate of Pluto. There the dreamer watches as Diana and Neptune accuse Aeolus of flouting their authority and discrediting them in the eyes of their worshippers. Before the trial can be concluded a messenger comes from Apollo, asking Minos to hold off on the judgement and inviting all the gods to his palace for a banquet. In Apollo\u2019s palace, Diana\u2019s complaint is resolved and the dreamer describes each of the gods and goddesses as they sit down to eat. The gods won\u2019t allow Discord into their feast, but as she is leaving she meets with Atropos and sends him to stir things up. Atropos goes to the gods and complains that while the gods claim to have given him power to bring death to any who disobeyed or despised them, there is one person who has escaped his power. He threatens to leave their employ if they don\u2019t make good on their promise to him and give him power over this person. All the gods agree that they will bring down this one who defies Atropos. They quickly resolve the dispute between Neptune and Aeolus to ensure that the offender will not be able to escape in the sea or air and then ask who it is that has defied them. When Atropos tells them that it is Virtue, Pluto says he knows him well and the only thing that can harm Virtue is Vice, Pluto\u2019s bastard son. Vice is called for, and he assembles his host for battle. Morpheus warns Virtue of the impending battle and Virtue prepares his host and heads to the field of Microcosm, hoping to arrive before Vice and thus have the advantage. The descriptions of the assembly of these armies are made up long lists of characters representing various vices and virtues and types of people under the influence of Vice and Virtue.\nThe second narrative episode of the poem is a psychomachian battle between the hosts of Virtue and Vice for the field of Microcosm, which is possessed by Freewill. As the battle heats up, Freewill joins forces with Vice and they begin to drive Virtue and his host from the field. Perseverance comes and rallies Virtue\u2019s troops, defeats Vice and wins the field. Freewill goes through a process of cleansing and is made a vassal of Virtue. Reason and Sadness are given control of Microcosm and set about cleansing it of the weeds planted there by Sensuality. A disgusted Atropos determines to leave the service of the \u201ccounterfete\u201d gods saying, \u201cFor oo God ther ys that can euery dell \/ Turne as hym lyst, bothe dry & whete, \/ In to whos seruyce I shall assay to gete\u201d (39). He goes in search of the Lord of Light and is told by Righteousness that the Lord of Light has been his master all along. Atropos\u2019 name is changed to Death and he is sent to Microcosm. Priesthood and the sacraments are sent to the field to prepare it for the coming of Death who causes the grass to wither and shuts the gates on the field.\nThe third episode of the poem takes place in the arbor of Doctrine where the dreamer is taken to be instructed in the meaning of the vision he has seen. The walls of the arbor are painted with images of people from the history of the world which Doctrine uses to explain the meaning of the dream and the genesis of the pagan deities and to encourage the dreamer in the right way of life. When she is done, the dreamer remembers his question about the accord of reason and sensuality and he asks her to \u201cdetermyne that doute\u201d (56). She is surprised that he has not figured it out yet, and with that, Death appears. As the dreamer hides in fear of Death, Reason and Sensuality appear and agree that people should fear death.\nAfter Doctrine explains this accord to the dreamer he is taken back to his spot by the lake. He awakens and writes his dream, exhorting those who read it, hear it read or see it to learn from it and asking the blessings of heaven on those who do.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Assemble of Goddes, by Anonymous\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

The\nfirst mention of Lydgate's authorship of this work was made by Stephen\nHawes in 1505 as one of Lydgate's seven major works. But many scholars\nhave doubted over the years that this poem was written by Lydgate,\nbecause the style used doesn't greatly resemble the style of Lydgate's\nother works, and the vocabulary is somewhat more modern than Lydgate is\nknown to have used. Modern scholars believe that this work was written\nbetween 1478 and 1483 (about forty years after Lydgate's death).\nAnalysis of style and vocabulary have led scholars to conclude that the\nauthor might have been a woman. For further information about this poem\nplease see The Assembly of Gods, edited by Jane Chance, published by\nMedieval Institute Publications, Kalamazoo, Michigan, 1999, ISBN:\n1580440223, which is also available online at\nhttp:\/\/www.lib.rochester.edu\/camelot\/teams\/asint.htm.\n\nThe book from which this e-book was transcribed is a fascimile reprint\nof the third printing of this book, made by Wynkyn de Worde circa 1500.\nThe book was printed in blackletter font known as Wynkyn de Worde's type\n3, and uses many abbreviations, which I have expanded and rendered\ninside parenthesis, eg., {x}. The abbreviations used in this book are:\n\n  *Macron over the letter. The most common one, usually meaning\n    missing \"n\" or \"m\" after the letter. But in some cases might also\n    mean missing \"e,\" \"er\" or \"re\" after the letter. This happens\n    usually when p, q or r have macrons.\n  *Little e over Middle-English thorn, meaning \"the.\"\n  *Little t over Middle-English thorn, meaning \"that.\"\n  *Little u over Middle-English thorn, meaning \"thou.\"\n  *Little t over w, meaning \"with.\"\n  *Middle-English yogh, representing \"gh.\"\n  *Superscripted 9 after letter, meaning missing \"us.\" Used only at\n    the end of the word.\n  *Superscripted 2 after letter, meaning missing \"e,\" \"er\" or \"re.\"\n    Used only at the end of the word.\n  *Stretched s, looking like integral sign, meaning missing \"e\" or \"i\"\n    before letter s.\n  *Dot over the letter, meaning missing \"e,\" \"er\" or \"re\" after the\n    letter. Usually used with d, t, e and u. Combination q+d with dot\n    means \"quod.\"\n  *Strike through letter, meaning missing \"e,\" \"er\" or \"re\" after the\n    letter. Usually used with p, v and s. Striked through p might also\n    mean missing \"ro\" or \"or\" after p.\n\nOccasionally there were some letters printed upside down. I have\nrendered them inside brackets, e.g., [x]. The poem uses two types of\npunctuation--a dot, meaning longer pause, and a slash, meaning shorter\npause or comma. I have corrected many errors and noted them on a right\nmargin. Also this printing was missing three lines and one line had\nseveral letters missing from the middle of the line. I have marked them\non a right margin and the correct reading supplied from the modern\nedition. There were a couple of places where the word \"nota\" or \"note\"\nwas printed, but the actual notes weren't found in this reprint. There's\na fair chance that those notes were never printed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":874,"split":"train"}
