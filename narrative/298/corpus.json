Their ancestors were made Dukes and given imperial titles, and as the novel begins the two houses are among the most illustrious families in the city. One of the clan\u2019s offspring is made a Royal Consort, and a lush landscaped garden is built to receive her visit. The novel describes the Jias\u2019 wealth and influence in great naturalistic detail, and charts the Jias\u2019 fall from the height of their prestige, following some thirty main characters and over four hundred minor ones. Eventually the Jia clan falls into disfavor with the Emperor, and their mansions are raided and confiscated.\nIn the novel's frame story, a sentient Stone, abandoned by the goddess N\u00fcwa when she mended the heavens aeons ago, begs a Taoist priest and a Buddhist monk to bring it with them to see the world. The Stone, along with a companion (in Cheng-Gao versions they are merged into the same character), is then given a chance to learn from the human existence, and enters the mortal realm.\nThe main character of the novel is the carefree adolescent male heir of the family, Jia Baoyu. He was born with a magical piece of \"jade\" in his mouth. In this life he has a special bond with his sickly cousin Lin Daiyu, who shares his love of music and poetry. Baoyu, however, is predestined to marry another cousin, Xue Baochai, whose grace and intelligence exemplify an ideal woman, but with whom he lacks an emotional connection. The romantic rivalry and friendship among the three characters against the backdrop of the family's declining fortunes form the main story in the novel.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Hung Lou Meng, Book I, by Cao Xueqin\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Subsequent to the\nvisions of a dream which he had, on some previous occasion, experienced,\nthe writer personally relates, he designedly concealed the true\ncircumstances, and borrowed the attributes of perception and\nspirituality to relate this story of the Record of the Stone. With this\npurpose, he made use of such designations as Chen Shih-yin (truth under\nthe garb of fiction) and the like. What are, however, the events\nrecorded in this work? Who are the dramatis personae?\n\nWearied with the drudgery experienced of late in the world, the author\nspeaking for himself, goes on to explain, with the lack of success which\nattended every single concern, I suddenly bethought myself of the\nwomankind of past ages. Passing one by one under a minute scrutiny, I\nfelt that in action and in lore, one and all were far above me; that in\nspite of the majesty of my manliness, I could not, in point of fact,\ncompare with these characters of the gentle sex. And my shame forsooth\nthen knew no bounds; while regret, on the other hand, was of no avail,\nas there was not even a remote possibility of a day of remedy.\n\nOn this very day it was that I became desirous to compile, in a\nconnected form, for publication throughout the world, with a view to\n(universal) information, how that I bear inexorable and manifold\nretribution; inasmuch as what time, by the sustenance of the benevolence\nof Heaven, and the virtue of my ancestors, my apparel was rich and fine,\nand as what days my fare was savory and sumptuous, I disregarded the\nbounty of education and nurture of father and mother, and paid no heed\nto the virtue of precept and injunction of teachers and friends, with\nthe result that I incurred the punishment, of failure recently in the\nleast trifle, and the reckless waste of half my lifetime. There have\nbeen meanwhile, generation after generation, those in the inner\nchambers, the whole mass of whom could not, on any account, be, through\nmy influence, allowed to fall into extinction, in order that I, unfilial\nas I have been, may have the means to screen my own shortcomings.\n\nHence it is that the thatched shed, with bamboo mat windows, the bed of\ntow and the stove of brick, which are at present my share, are not\nsufficient to deter me from carrying out the fixed purpose of my mind.\nAnd could I, furthermore, confront the morning breeze, the evening moon,\nthe willows by the steps and the flowers in the courtyard, methinks\nthese would moisten to a greater degree my mortal pen with ink; but\nthough I lack culture and erudition, what harm is there, however, in\nemploying fiction and unrecondite language to give utterance to the\nmerits of these characters? And were I also able to induce the inmates\nof the inner chamber to understand and diffuse them, could I besides\nbreak the weariness of even so much as a single moment, or could I open\nthe eyes of my contemporaries, will it not forsooth prove a boon?\n\nThis consideration has led to the usage of such names as Chia Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un\nand other similar appellations.\n\nMore than any in these pages have been employed such words as dreams and\nvisions; but these dreams constitute the main argument of this work, and\ncombine, furthermore, the design of giving a word of warning to my\nreaders.\n\nReader, can you suggest whence the story begins?\n\nThe narration may border on the limits of incoherency and triviality,\nbut it possesses considerable zest. But to begin.\n\nThe Empress N\u00c3\u00bc Wo, (the goddess of works,) in fashioning blocks of\nstones, for the repair of the heavens, prepared, at the Ta Huang Hills\nand Wu Ch'i cave, 36,501 blocks of rough stone, each twelve chang in\nheight, and twenty-four chang square. Of these stones, the Empress Wo\nonly used 36,500; so that one single block remained over and above,\nwithout being turned to any account. This was cast down the Ch'ing Keng\npeak. This stone, strange to say, after having undergone a process of\nrefinement, attained a nature of efficiency, and could, by its innate\npowers, set itself into motion and was able to expand and to contract.\n\nWhen it became aware that the whole number of blocks had been made use\nof to repair the heavens, that it alone had been destitute of the\nnecessary properties and had been unfit to attain selection, it\nforthwith felt within itself vexation and shame, and day and night, it\ngave way to anguish and sorrow.\n\nOne day, while it lamented its lot, it suddenly caught sight, at a great\ndistance, of a Buddhist bonze and of a Taoist priest coming towards that\ndirection. Their appearance was uncommon, their easy manner remarkable.\nWhen they drew near this Ch'ing Keng peak, they sat on the ground to\nrest, and began to converse. But on noticing the block newly-polished\nand brilliantly clear, which had moreover contracted in dimensions, and\nbecome no larger than the pendant of a fan, they were greatly filled\nwith admiration. The Buddhist priest picked it up, and laid it in the\npalm of his hand.\n\n\"Your appearance,\" he said laughingly, \"may well declare you to be a\nsupernatural object, but as you lack any inherent quality it is\nnecessary to inscribe a few characters on you, so that every one who\nshall see you may at once recognise you to be a remarkable thing. And\nsubsequently, when you will be taken into a country where honour and\naffluence will reign, into a family cultured in mind and of official\nstatus, in a land where flowers and trees shall flourish with\nluxuriance, in a town of refinement, renown and glory; when you once\nwill have been there...\"\n\nThe stone listened with intense delight.\n\n\"What characters may I ask,\" it consequently inquired, \"will you\ninscribe? and what place will I be taken to? pray, pray explain to me in\nlucid terms.\" \"You mustn't be inquisitive,\" the bonze replied, with a\nsmile, \"in days to come you'll certainly understand everything.\" Having\nconcluded these words, he forthwith put the stone in his sleeve, and\nproceeded leisurely on his journey, in company with the Taoist priest.\nWhither, however, he took the stone, is not divulged. Nor can it be\nknown how many centuries and ages elapsed, before a Taoist priest, K'ung\nK'ung by name, passed, during his researches after the eternal reason\nand his quest after immortality, by these Ta Huang Hills, Wu Ch'i cave\nand Ch'ing Keng Peak. Suddenly perceiving a large block of stone, on the\nsurface of which the traces of characters giving, in a connected form,\nthe various incidents of its fate, could be clearly deciphered, K'ung\nK'ung examined them from first to last. They, in fact, explained how\nthat this block of worthless stone had originally been devoid of the\nproperties essential for the repairs to the heavens, how it would be\ntransmuted into human form and introduced by Mang Mang the High Lord,\nand Miao Miao, the Divine, into the world of mortals, and how it would\nbe led over the other bank (across the San Sara). On the surface, the\nrecord of the spot where it would fall, the place of its birth, as well\nas various family trifles and trivial love affairs of young ladies,\nverses, odes, speeches and enigmas was still complete; but the name of\nthe dynasty and the year of the reign were obliterated, and could not be\nascertained.\n\nOn the obverse, were also the following enigmatical verses:\n\n  Lacking in virtues meet the azure skies to mend,\n  In vain the mortal world full many a year I wend,\n  Of a former and after life these facts that be,\n  Who will for a tradition strange record for me?\n\nK'ung K'ung, the Taoist, having pondered over these lines for a while,\nbecame aware that this stone had a history of some kind.\n\n\"Brother stone,\" he forthwith said, addressing the stone, \"the concerns\nof past days recorded on you possess, according to your own account, a\nconsiderable amount of interest, and have been for this reason\ninscribed, with the intent of soliciting generations to hand them down\nas remarkable occurrences. But in my own opinion, they lack, in the\nfirst place, any data by means of which to establish the name of the\nEmperor and the year of his reign; and, in the second place, these\nconstitute no record of any excellent policy, adopted by any high\nworthies or high loyal statesmen, in the government of the state, or in\nthe rule of public morals. The contents simply treat of a certain number\nof maidens, of exceptional character; either of their love affairs or\ninfatuations, or of their small deserts or insignificant talents; and\nwere I to transcribe the whole collection of them, they would,\nnevertheless, not be estimated as a book of any exceptional worth.\"\n\n\"Sir Priest,\" the stone replied with assurance, \"why are you so\nexcessively dull? The dynasties recorded in the rustic histories, which\nhave been written from age to age, have, I am fain to think, invariably\nassumed, under false pretences, the mere nomenclature of the Han and\nT'ang dynasties. They differ from the events inscribed on my block,\nwhich do not borrow this customary practice, but, being based on my own\nexperiences and natural feelings, present, on the contrary, a novel and\nunique character. Besides, in the pages of these rustic histories,\neither the aspersions upon sovereigns and statesmen, or the strictures\nupon individuals, their wives, and their daughters, or the deeds of\nlicentiousness and violence are too numerous to be computed. Indeed,\nthere is one more kind of loose literature, the wantonness and pollution\nin which work most easy havoc upon youth.\n\n\"As regards the works, in which the characters of scholars and beauties\nis delineated their allusions are again repeatedly of Wen Ch\u00c3\u00bcn, their\ntheme in every page of Tzu Chien; a thousand volumes present no\ndiversity; and a thousand characters are but a counterpart of each\nother. What is more, these works, throughout all their pages, cannot\nhelp bordering on extreme licence. The authors, however, had no other\nobject in view than to give utterance to a few sentimental odes and\nelegant ballads of their own, and for this reason they have fictitiously\ninvented the names and surnames of both men and women, and necessarily\nintroduced, in addition, some low characters, who should, like a buffoon\nin a play, create some excitement in the plot.\n\n\"Still more loathsome is a kind of pedantic and profligate literature,\nperfectly devoid of all natural sentiment, full of self-contradictions;\nand, in fact, the contrast to those maidens in my work, whom I have,\nduring half my lifetime, seen with my own eyes and heard with my own\nears. And though I will not presume to estimate them as superior to the\nheroes and heroines in the works of former ages, yet the perusal of the\nmotives and issues of their experiences, may likewise afford matter\nsufficient to banish dulness, and to break the spell of melancholy.\n\n\"As regards the several stanzas of doggerel verse, they may too evoke\nsuch laughter as to compel the reader to blurt out the rice, and to\nspurt out the wine.\n\n\"In these pages, the scenes depicting the anguish of separation, the\nbliss of reunion, and the fortunes of prosperity and of adversity are\nall, in every detail, true to human nature, and I have not taken upon\nmyself to make the slightest addition, or alteration, which might lead\nto the perversion of the truth.\n\n\"My only object has been that men may, after a drinking bout, or after\nthey wake from sleep or when in need of relaxation from the pressure of\nbusiness, take up this light literature, and not only expunge the traces\nof antiquated books, and obtain a new kind of distraction, but that they\nmay also lay by a long life as well as energy and strength; for it bears\nno point of similarity to those works, whose designs are false, whose\ncourse is immoral. Now, Sir Priest, what are your views on the subject?\"\n\nK'ung K'ung having pondered for a while over the words, to which he had\nlistened intently, re-perused, throughout, this record of the stone; and\nfinding that the general purport consisted of nought else than a\ntreatise on love, and likewise of an accurate transcription of facts,\nwithout the least taint of profligacy injurious to the times, he\nthereupon copied the contents, from beginning to end, to the intent of\ncharging the world to hand them down as a strange story.\n\nHence it was that K'ung K'ung, the Taoist, in consequence of his\nperception, (in his state of) abstraction, of passion, the generation,\nfrom this passion, of voluptuousness, the transmission of this\nvoluptuousness into passion, and the apprehension, by means of passion,\nof its unreality, forthwith altered his name for that of \"Ch'ing Tseng\"\n(the Voluptuous Bonze), and changed the title of \"the Memoir of a Stone\"\n(Shih-t'ou-chi,) for that of \"Ch'ing Tseng Lu,\" The Record of the\nVoluptuous Bonze; while K'ung Mei-chi of Tung Lu gave it the name of\n\"Feng Y\u00c3\u00bceh Pao Chien,\" \"The Precious Mirror of Voluptuousness.\" In later\nyears, owing to the devotion by Tsao Hs\u00c3\u00bceh-ch'in in the Tao Hung study,\nof ten years to the perusal and revision of the work, the additions and\nmodifications effected by him five times, the affix of an index and the\ndivision into periods and chapters, the book was again entitled \"Chin\nLing Shih Erh Ch'ai,\" \"The Twelve Maidens of Chin Ling.\" A stanza was\nfurthermore composed for the purpose. This then, and no other, is the\norigin of the Record of the Stone. The poet says appositely:--\n\n  Pages full of silly litter,\n  Tears a handful sour and bitter;\n  All a fool the author hold,\n  But their zest who can unfold?\n\nYou have now understood the causes which brought about the Record of the\nStone, but as you are not, as yet, aware what characters are depicted,\nand what circumstances are related on the surface of the block, reader,\nplease lend an ear to the narrative on the stone, which runs as\nfollows:--\n\nIn old days, the land in the South East lay low. In this South-East part\nof the world, was situated a walled town, Ku Su by name. Within the\nwalls a locality, called the Ch'ang Men, was more than all others\nthroughout the mortal world, the centre, which held the second, if not\nthe first place for fashion and life. Beyond this Ch'ang Men was a\nstreet called Shih-li-chieh (Ten _Li_ street); in this street a lane,\nthe Jen Ch'ing lane (Humanity and Purity); and in this lane stood an old\ntemple, which on account of its diminutive dimensions, was called, by\ngeneral consent, the Gourd temple. Next door to this temple lived the\nfamily of a district official, Chen by surname, Fei by name, and\nShih-yin by style. His wife, n\u00c3\u00a9e Feng, possessed a worthy and virtuous\ndisposition, and had a clear perception of moral propriety and good\nconduct. This family, though not in actual possession of excessive\naffluence and honours, was, nevertheless, in their district, conceded to\nbe a clan of well-to-do standing. As this Chen Shih-yin was of a\ncontented and unambitious frame of mind, and entertained no hankering\nafter any official distinction, but day after day of his life took\ndelight in gazing at flowers, planting bamboos, sipping his wine and\nconning poetical works, he was in fact, in the indulgence of these\npursuits, as happy as a supernatural being.\n\nOne thing alone marred his happiness. He had lived over half a century\nand had, as yet, no male offspring around his knees. He had one only\nchild, a daughter, whose infant name was Ying Lien. She was just three\nyears of age. On a long summer day, on which the heat had been intense,\nShih-yin sat leisurely in his library. Feeling his hand tired, he\ndropped the book he held, leant his head on a teapoy, and fell asleep.\n\nOf a sudden, while in this state of unconsciousness, it seemed as if he\nhad betaken himself on foot to some spot or other whither he could not\ndiscriminate. Unexpectedly he espied, in the opposite direction, two\npriests coming towards him: the one a Buddhist, the other a Taoist. As\nthey advanced they kept up the conversation in which they were engaged.\n\"Whither do you purpose taking the object you have brought away?\" he\nheard the Taoist inquire. To this question the Buddhist replied with a\nsmile: \"Set your mind at ease,\" he said; \"there's now in maturity a plot\nof a general character involving mundane pleasures, which will presently\ncome to a denouement. The whole number of the votaries of voluptuousness\nhave, as yet, not been quickened or entered the world, and I mean to\navail myself of this occasion to introduce this object among their\nnumber, so as to give it a chance to go through the span of human\nexistence.\" \"The votaries of voluptuousness of these days will naturally\nhave again to endure the ills of life during their course through the\nmortal world,\" the Taoist remarked; \"but when, I wonder, will they\nspring into existence? and in what place will they descend?\"\n\n\"The account of these circumstances,\" the bonze ventured to reply, \"is\nenough to make you laugh! They amount to this: there existed in the\nwest, on the bank of the Ling (spiritual) river, by the side of the San\nSheng (thrice-born) stone, a blade of the Chiang Chu (purple pearl)\ngrass. At about the same time it was that the block of stone was,\nconsequent upon its rejection by the goddess of works, also left to\nramble and wander to its own gratification, and to roam about at\npleasure to every and any place. One day it came within the precincts of\nthe Ching Huan (Monitory Vision) Fairy; and this Fairy, cognizant of the\nfact that this stone had a history, detained it, therefore, to reside at\nthe Ch'ih Hsia (purple clouds) palace, and apportioned to it the duties\nof attendant on Shen Ying, a fairy of the Ch'ih Hsia palace.\n\n\"This stone would, however, often stroll along the banks of the Ling\nriver, and having at the sight of the blade of spiritual grass been\nfilled with admiration, it, day by day, moistened its roots with sweet\ndew. This purple pearl grass, at the outset, tarried for months and\nyears; but being at a later period imbued with the essence and\nluxuriance of heaven and earth, and having incessantly received the\nmoisture and nurture of the sweet dew, divested itself, in course of\ntime, of the form of a grass; assuming, in lieu, a human nature, which\ngradually became perfected into the person of a girl.\n\n\"Every day she was wont to wander beyond the confines of the Li Hen\n(divested animosities) heavens. When hungry she fed on the Pi Ch'ing\n(hidden love) fruit--when thirsty she drank the Kuan ch'ou (discharged\nsorrows,) water. Having, however, up to this time, not shewn her\ngratitude for the virtue of nurture lavished upon her, the result was\nbut natural that she should resolve in her heart upon a constant and\nincessant purpose to make suitable acknowledgment.\n\n\"I have been,\" she would often commune within herself, \"the recipient of\nthe gracious bounty of rain and dew, but I possess no such water as was\nlavished upon me to repay it! But should it ever descend into the world\nin the form of a human being, I will also betake myself thither, along\nwith it; and if I can only have the means of making restitution to it,\nwith the tears of a whole lifetime, I may be able to make adequate\nreturn.\"\n\n\"This resolution it is that will evolve the descent into the world of so\nmany pleasure-bound spirits of retribution and the experience of\nfantastic destinies; and this crimson pearl blade will also be among the\nnumber. The stone still lies in its original place, and why should not\nyou and I take it along before the tribunal of the Monitory Vision\nFairy, and place on its behalf its name on record, so that it should\ndescend into the world, in company with these spirits of passion, and\nbring this plot to an issue?\"\n\n\"It is indeed ridiculous,\" interposed the Taoist. \"Never before have I\nheard even the very mention of restitution by means of tears! Why should\nnot you and I avail ourselves of this opportunity to likewise go down\ninto the world? and if successful in effecting the salvation of a few of\nthem, will it not be a work meritorious and virtuous?\"\n\n\"This proposal,\" remarked the Buddhist, \"is quite in harmony with my own\nviews. Come along then with me to the palace of the Monitory Vision\nFairy, and let us deliver up this good-for-nothing object, and have done\nwith it! And when the company of pleasure-bound spirits of wrath descend\ninto human existence, you and I can then enter the world. Half of them\nhave already fallen into the dusty universe, but the whole number of\nthem have not, as yet, come together.\"\n\n\"Such being the case,\" the Taoist acquiesced, \"I am ready to follow you,\nwhenever you please to go.\"\n\nBut to return to Chen Shih-yin. Having heard every one of these words\ndistinctly, he could not refrain from forthwith stepping forward and\npaying homage. \"My spiritual lords,\" he said, as he smiled, \"accept my\nobeisance.\" The Buddhist and Taoist priests lost no time in responding\nto the compliment, and they exchanged the usual salutations. \"My\nspiritual lords,\" Shih-yin continued; \"I have just heard the\nconversation that passed between you, on causes and effects, a\nconversation the like of which few mortals have forsooth listened to;\nbut your younger brother is sluggish of intellect, and cannot lucidly\nfathom the import! Yet could this dulness and simplicity be graciously\ndispelled, your younger brother may, by listening minutely, with\nundefiled ear and careful attention, to a certain degree be aroused to a\nsense of understanding; and what is more, possibly find the means of\nescaping the anguish of sinking down into Hades.\"\n\nThe two spirits smiled, \"The conversation,\" they added, \"refers to the\nprimordial scheme and cannot be divulged before the proper season; but,\nwhen the time comes, mind do not forget us two, and you will readily be\nable to escape from the fiery furnace.\"\n\nShih-yin, after this reply, felt it difficult to make any further\ninquiries. \"The primordial scheme,\" he however remarked smiling,\n\"cannot, of course, be divulged; but what manner of thing, I wonder, is\nthe good-for-nothing object you alluded to a short while back? May I not\nbe allowed to judge for myself?\"\n\n\"This object about which you ask,\" the Buddhist Bonze responded, \"is\nintended, I may tell you, by fate to be just glanced at by you.\" With\nthese words he produced it, and handed it over to Shih-yin.\n\nShih-yin received it. On scrutiny he found it, in fact, to be a\nbeautiful gem, so lustrous and so clear that the traces of characters on\nthe surface were distinctly visible. The characters inscribed consisted\nof the four \"T'ung Ling Pao Y\u00c3\u00bc,\" \"Precious Gem of Spiritual Perception.\"\nOn the obverse, were also several columns of minute words, which he was\njust in the act of looking at intently, when the Buddhist at once\nexpostulated.\n\n\"We have already reached,\" he exclaimed, \"the confines of vision.\"\nSnatching it violently out of his hands, he walked away with the Taoist,\nunder a lofty stone portal, on the face of which appeared in large type\nthe four characters: \"T'ai Hs\u00c3\u00bc Huan Ching,\" \"The Visionary limits of the\nGreat Void.\" On each side was a scroll with the lines:\n\n  When falsehood stands for truth, truth likewise becomes false,\n  Where naught be made to aught, aught changes into naught.\n\nShih-yin meant also to follow them on the other side, but, as he was\nabout to make one step forward, he suddenly heard a crash, just as if\nthe mountains had fallen into ruins, and the earth sunk into\ndestruction. As Shih-yin uttered a loud shout, he looked with strained\neye; but all he could see was the fiery sun shining, with glowing rays,\nwhile the banana leaves drooped their heads. By that time, half of the\ncircumstances connected with the dream he had had, had already slipped\nfrom his memory.\n\nHe also noticed a nurse coming towards him with Ying Lien in her arms.\nTo Shih-yin's eyes his daughter appeared even more beautiful, such a\nbright gem, so precious, and so lovable. Forthwith stretching out his\narms, he took her over, and, as he held her in his embrace, he coaxed\nher to play with him for a while; after which he brought her up to the\nstreet to see the great stir occasioned by the procession that was going\npast.\n\nHe was about to come in, when he caught sight of two priests, one a\nTaoist, the other a Buddhist, coming hither from the opposite direction.\nThe Buddhist had a head covered with mange, and went barefooted. The\nTaoist had a limping foot, and his hair was all dishevelled.\n\nLike maniacs, they jostled along, chattering and laughing as they drew\nnear.\n\nAs soon as they reached Shih-yin's door, and they perceived him with\nYing Lien in his arms, the Bonze began to weep aloud.\n\nTurning towards Shih-yin, he said to him: \"My good Sir, why need you\ncarry in your embrace this living but luckless thing, which will involve\nfather and mother in trouble?\"\n\nThese words did not escape Shih-yin's ear; but persuaded that they\namounted to raving talk, he paid no heed whatever to the bonze.\n\n\"Part with her and give her to me,\" the Buddhist still went on to say.\n\nShih-yin could not restrain his annoyance; and hastily pressing his\ndaughter closer to him, he was intent upon going in, when the bonze\npointed his hand at him, and burst out in a loud fit of laughter.\n\nHe then gave utterance to the four lines that follow:\n\n  You indulge your tender daughter and are laughed at as inane;\n  Vain you face the snow, oh mirror! for it will evanescent wane,\n  When the festival of lanterns is gone by, guard 'gainst your doom,\n  'Tis what time the flames will kindle, and the fire will consume.\n\nShih-yin understood distinctly the full import of what he heard; but his\nheart was still full of conjectures. He was about to inquire who and\nwhat they were, when he heard the Taoist remark,--\"You and I cannot\nspeed together; let us now part company, and each of us will be then\nable to go after his own business. After the lapse of three ages, I\nshall be at the Pei Mang mount, waiting for you; and we can, after our\nreunion, betake ourselves to the Visionary Confines of the Great Void,\nthere to cancel the name of the stone from the records.\"\n\n\"Excellent! first rate!\" exclaimed the Bonze. And at the conclusion of\nthese words, the two men parted, each going his own way, and no trace\nwas again seen of them.\n\n\"These two men,\" Shih-yin then pondered within his heart, \"must have had\nmany experiences, and I ought really to have made more inquiries of\nthem; but at this juncture to indulge in regret is anyhow too late.\"\n\nWhile Shih-yin gave way to these foolish reflections, he suddenly\nnoticed the arrival of a penniless scholar, Chia by surname, Hua by\nname, Shih-fei by style and Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un by nickname, who had taken up his\nquarters in the Gourd temple next door. This Chia Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un was\noriginally a denizen of Hu-Chow, and was also of literary and official\nparentage, but as he was born of the youngest stock, and the possessions\nof his paternal and maternal ancestors were completely exhausted, and\nhis parents and relatives were dead, he remained the sole and only\nsurvivor; and, as he found his residence in his native place of no\navail, he therefore entered the capital in search of that reputation,\nwhich would enable him to put the family estate on a proper standing. He\nhad arrived at this place since the year before last, and had, what is\nmore, lived all along in very straitened circumstances. He had made the\ntemple his temporary quarters, and earned a living by daily occupying\nhimself in composing documents and writing letters for customers. Thus\nit was that Shih-yin had been in constant relations with him.\n\nAs soon as Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un perceived Shih-yin, he lost no time in saluting him.\n\"My worthy Sir,\" he observed with a forced smile; \"how is it you are\nleaning against the door and looking out? Is there perchance any news\nastir in the streets, or in the public places?\"\n\n\"None whatever,\" replied Shih-yin, as he returned the smile. \"Just a\nwhile back, my young daughter was in sobs, and I coaxed her out here to\namuse her. I am just now without anything whatever to attend to, so\nthat, dear brother Chia, you come just in the nick of time. Please walk\ninto my mean abode, and let us endeavour, in each other's company, to\nwhile away this long summer day.\"\n\nAfter he had made this remark, he bade a servant take his daughter in,\nwhile he, hand-in-hand with Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un, walked into the library, where a\nyoung page served tea. They had hardly exchanged a few sentences, when\none of the household came in, in flying haste, to announce that Mr. Yen\nhad come to pay a visit.\n\nShih-yin at once stood up. \"Pray excuse my rudeness,\" he remarked\napologetically, \"but do sit down; I shall shortly rejoin you, and enjoy\nthe pleasure of your society.\" \"My dear Sir,\" answered Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un, as he\ngot up, also in a conceding way, \"suit your own convenience. I've often\nhad the honour of being your guest, and what will it matter if I wait a\nlittle?\" While these apologies were yet being spoken, Shih-yin had\nalready walked out into the front parlour. During his absence, Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un\noccupied himself in turning over the pages of some poetical work to\ndispel ennui, when suddenly he heard, outside the window, a woman's\ncough. Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un hurriedly got up and looked out. He saw at a glance that\nit was a servant girl engaged in picking flowers. Her deportment was out\nof the common; her eyes so bright, her eyebrows so well defined. Though\nnot a perfect beauty, she possessed nevertheless charms sufficient to\narouse the feelings. Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un unwittingly gazed at her with fixed eye.\nThis waiting-maid, belonging to the Chen family, had done picking\nflowers, and was on the point of going in, when she of a sudden raised\nher eyes and became aware of the presence of some person inside the\nwindow, whose head-gear consisted of a turban in tatters, while his\nclothes were the worse for wear. But in spite of his poverty, he was\nnaturally endowed with a round waist, a broad back, a fat face, a square\nmouth; added to this, his eyebrows were swordlike, his eyes resembled\nstars, his nose was straight, his cheeks square.\n\nThis servant girl turned away in a hurry and made her escape.\n\n\"This man so burly and strong,\" she communed within herself, \"yet at the\nsame time got up in such poor attire, must, I expect, be no one else\nthan the man, whose name is Chia Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un or such like, time after time\nreferred to by my master, and to whom he has repeatedly wished to give a\nhelping hand, but has failed to find a favourable opportunity. And as\nrelated to our family there is no connexion or friend in such straits, I\nfeel certain it cannot be any other person than he. Strange to say, my\nmaster has further remarked that this man will, for a certainty, not\nalways continue in such a state of destitution.\"\n\nAs she indulged in this train of thought, she could not restrain herself\nfrom turning her head round once or twice.\n\nWhen Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un perceived that she had looked back, he readily interpreted\nit as a sign that in her heart her thoughts had been of him, and he was\nfrantic with irrepressible joy.\n\n\"This girl,\" he mused, \"is, no doubt, keen-eyed and eminently shrewd,\nand one in this world who has seen through me.\"\n\nThe servant youth, after a short time, came into the room; and when\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un made inquiries and found out from him that the guests in the\nfront parlour had been detained to dinner, he could not very well wait\nany longer, and promptly walked away down a side passage and out of a\nback door.\n\nWhen the guests had taken their leave, Shih-yin did not go back to\nrejoin Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un, as he had come to know that he had already left.\n\nIn time the mid-autumn festivities drew near; and Shih-yin, after the\nfamily banquet was over, had a separate table laid in the library, and\ncrossed over, in the moonlight, as far as the temple and invited\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un to come round.\n\nThe fact is that Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un, ever since the day on which he had seen the\ngirl of the Chen family turn twice round to glance at him, flattered\nhimself that she was friendly disposed towards him, and incessantly\nfostered fond thoughts of her in his heart. And on this day, which\nhappened to be the mid-autumn feast, he could not, as he gazed at the\nmoon, refrain from cherishing her remembrance. Hence it was that he gave\nvent to these pentameter verses:\n\n  Alas! not yet divined my lifelong wish,\n  And anguish ceaseless comes upon anguish\n  I came, and sad at heart, my brow I frowned;\n  She went, and oft her head to look turned round.\n  Facing the breeze, her shadow she doth watch,\n  Who's meet this moonlight night with her to match?\n  The lustrous rays if they my wish but read\n  Would soon alight upon her beauteous head!\n\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un having, after this recitation, recalled again to mind how that\nthroughout his lifetime his literary attainments had had an adverse fate\nand not met with an opportunity (of reaping distinction), went on to rub\nhis brow, and as he raised his eyes to the skies, he heaved a deep sigh\nand once more intoned a couplet aloud:\n\n  The gem in the cask a high price it seeks,\n  The pin in the case to take wing it waits.\n\nAs luck would have it, Shih-yin was at the moment approaching, and upon\nhearing the lines, he said with a smile: \"My dear Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un, really your\nattainments are of no ordinary capacity.\"\n\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un lost no time in smiling and replying. \"It would be presumption\nin my part to think so,\" he observed. \"I was simply at random humming a\nfew verses composed by former writers, and what reason is there to laud\nme to such an excessive degree? To what, my dear Sir, do I owe the\npleasure of your visit?\" he went on to inquire. \"Tonight,\" replied\nShih-yin, \"is the mid-autumn feast, generally known as the full-moon\nfestival; and as I could not help thinking that living, as you my worthy\nbrother are, as a mere stranger in this Buddhist temple, you could not\nbut experience the feeling of loneliness. I have, for the express\npurpose, prepared a small entertainment, and will be pleased if you will\ncome to my mean abode to have a glass of wine. But I wonder whether you\nwill entertain favourably my modest invitation?\" Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un, after\nlistening to the proposal, put forward no refusal of any sort; but\nremarked complacently: \"Being the recipient of such marked attention,\nhow can I presume to repel your generous consideration?\"\n\nAs he gave expression to these words, he walked off there and then, in\ncompany with Shih-yin, and came over once again into the court in front\nof the library. In a few minutes, tea was over.\n\nThe cups and dishes had been laid from an early hour, and needless to\nsay the wines were luscious; the fare sumptuous.\n\nThe two friends took their seats. At first they leisurely replenished\ntheir glasses, and quietly sipped their wine; but as, little by little,\nthey entered into conversation, their good cheer grew more genial, and\nunawares the glasses began to fly round, and the cups to be exchanged.\n\nAt this very hour, in every house of the neighbourhood, sounded the fife\nand lute, while the inmates indulged in music and singing. Above head,\nthe orb of the radiant moon shone with an all-pervading splendour, and\nwith a steady lustrous light, while the two friends, as their exuberance\nincreased, drained their cups dry so soon as they reached their lips.\n\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un, at this stage of the collation, was considerably under the\ninfluence of wine, and the vehemence of his high spirits was\nirrepressible. As he gazed at the moon, he fostered thoughts, to which\nhe gave vent by the recital of a double couplet.\n\n  'Tis what time three meets five, Selene is a globe!\n  Her pure rays fill the court, the jadelike rails enrobe!\n  Lo! in the heavens her disk to view doth now arise,\n  And in the earth below to gaze men lift their eyes.\n\n\"Excellent!\" cried Shih-yin with a loud voice, after he had heard these\nlines; \"I have repeatedly maintained that it was impossible for you to\nremain long inferior to any, and now the verses you have recited are a\nprognostic of your rapid advancement. Already it is evident that, before\nlong, you will extend your footsteps far above the clouds! I must\ncongratulate you! I must congratulate you! Let me, with my own hands,\npour a glass of wine to pay you my compliments.\"\n\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un drained the cup. \"What I am about to say,\" he explained as he\nsuddenly heaved a sigh, \"is not the maudlin talk of a man under the\neffects of wine. As far as the subjects at present set in the\nexaminations go, I could, perchance, also have well been able to enter\nthe list, and to send in my name as a candidate; but I have, just now,\nno means whatever to make provision for luggage and for travelling\nexpenses. The distance too to Shen Ching is a long one, and I could not\ndepend upon the sale of papers or the composition of essays to find the\nmeans of getting there.\"\n\nShih-yin gave him no time to conclude. \"Why did you not speak about this\nsooner?\" he interposed with haste. \"I have long entertained this\nsuspicion; but as, whenever I met you, this conversation was never\nbroached, I did not presume to make myself officious. But if such be the\nstate of affairs just now, I lack, I admit, literary qualification, but\non the two subjects of friendly spirit and pecuniary means, I have,\nnevertheless, some experience. Moreover, I rejoice that next year is\njust the season for the triennial examinations, and you should start for\nthe capital with all despatch; and in the tripos next spring, you will,\nby carrying the prize, be able to do justice to the proficiency you can\nboast of. As regards the travelling expenses and the other items, the\nprovision of everything necessary for you by my own self will again not\nrender nugatory your mean acquaintance with me.\"\n\nForthwith, he directed a servant lad to go and pack up at once fifty\ntaels of pure silver and two suits of winter clothes.\n\n\"The nineteenth,\" he continued, \"is a propitious day, and you should\nlose no time in hiring a boat and starting on your journey westwards.\nAnd when, by your eminent talents, you shall have soared high to a lofty\nposition, and we meet again next winter, will not the occasion be\nextremely felicitous?\"\n\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un accepted the money and clothes with but scanty expression of\ngratitude. In fact, he paid no thought whatever to the gifts, but went\non, again drinking his wine, as he chattered and laughed.\n\nIt was only when the third watch of that day had already struck that the\ntwo friends parted company; and Shih-yin, after seeing Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un off,\nretired to his room and slept, with one sleep all through, never waking\nuntil the sun was well up in the skies.\n\nRemembering the occurrence of the previous night, he meant to write a\ncouple of letters of recommendation for Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un to take along with him\nto the capital, to enable him, after handing them over at the mansions\nof certain officials, to find some place as a temporary home. He\naccordingly despatched a servant to ask him to come round, but the man\nreturned and reported that from what the bonze said, \"Mr. Chia had\nstarted on his journey to the capital, at the fifth watch of that very\nmorning, that he had also left a message with the bonze to deliver to\nyou, Sir, to the effect that men of letters paid no heed to lucky or\nunlucky days, that the sole consideration with them was the nature of\nthe matter in hand, and that he could find no time to come round in\nperson and bid good-bye.\"\n\nShih-yin after hearing this message had no alternative but to banish the\nsubject from his thoughts.\n\nIn comfortable circumstances, time indeed goes by with easy stride. Soon\ndrew near also the happy festival of the 15th of the 1st moon, and\nShih-yin told a servant Huo Ch'i to take Ying Lien to see the\nsacrificial fires and flowery lanterns.\n\nAbout the middle of the night, Huo Ch'i was hard pressed, and he\nforthwith set Ying Lien down on the doorstep of a certain house. When he\nfelt relieved, he came back to take her up, but failed to find anywhere\nany trace of Ying Lien. In a terrible plight, Huo Ch'i prosecuted his\nsearch throughout half the night; but even by the dawn of day, he had\nnot discovered any clue of her whereabouts. Huo Ch'i, lacking, on the\nother hand, the courage to go back and face his master, promptly made\nhis escape to his native village.\n\nShih-yin--in fact, the husband as well as the wife--seeing that their\nchild had not come home during the whole night, readily concluded that\nsome mishap must have befallen her. Hastily they despatched several\nservants to go in search of her, but one and all returned to report that\nthere was neither vestige nor tidings of her.\n\nThis couple had only had this child, and this at the meridian of their\nlife, so that her sudden disappearance plunged them in such great\ndistress that day and night they mourned her loss to such a point as to\nwell nigh pay no heed to their very lives.\n\nA month in no time went by. Shih-yin was the first to fall ill, and his\nwife, Dame Feng, likewise, by dint of fretting for her daughter, was\nalso prostrated with sickness. The doctor was, day after day, sent for,\nand the oracle consulted by means of divination.\n\nLittle did any one think that on this day, being the 15th of the 3rd\nmoon, while the sacrificial oblations were being prepared in the Hu Lu\ntemple, a pan with oil would have caught fire, through the want of care\non the part of the bonze, and that in a short time the flames would have\nconsumed the paper pasted on the windows.\n\nAmong the natives of this district bamboo fences and wooden partitions\nwere in general use, and these too proved a source of calamity so\nordained by fate (to consummate this decree).\n\nWith promptness (the fire) extended to two buildings, then enveloped\nthree, then dragged four (into ruin), and then spread to five houses,\nuntil the whole street was in a blaze, resembling the flames of a\nvolcano. Though both the military and the people at once ran to the\nrescue, the fire had already assumed a serious hold, so that it was\nimpossible for them to afford any effective assistance for its\nsuppression.\n\nIt blazed away straight through the night, before it was extinguished,\nand consumed, there is in fact no saying how many dwelling houses.\nAnyhow, pitiful to relate, the Chen house, situated as it was next door\nto the temple, was, at an early part of the evening, reduced to a heap\nof tiles and bricks; and nothing but the lives of that couple and\nseveral inmates of the family did not sustain any injuries.\n\nShih-yin was in despair, but all he could do was to stamp his feet and\nheave deep sighs. After consulting with his wife, they betook themselves\nto a farm of theirs, where they took up their quarters temporarily. But\nas it happened that water had of late years been scarce, and no crops\nbeen reaped, robbers and thieves had sprung up like bees, and though the\nGovernment troops were bent upon their capture, it was anyhow difficult\nto settle down quietly on the farm. He therefore had no other resource\nthan to convert, at a loss, the whole of his property into money, and to\ntake his wife and two servant girls and come over for shelter to the\nhouse of his father-in-law.\n\nHis father-in-law, Feng Su, by name, was a native of Ta Ju Chou.\nAlthough only a labourer, he was nevertheless in easy circumstances at\nhome. When he on this occasion saw his son-in-law come to him in such\ndistress, he forthwith felt at heart considerable displeasure.\nFortunately Shih-yin had still in his possession the money derived from\nthe unprofitable realization of his property, so that he produced and\nhanded it to his father-in-law, commissioning him to purchase, whenever\na suitable opportunity presented itself, a house and land as a provision\nfor food and raiment against days to come. This Feng Su, however, only\nexpended the half of the sum, and pocketed the other half, merely\nacquiring for him some fallow land and a dilapidated house.\n\nShih-yin being, on the other hand, a man of books and with no experience\nin matters connected with business and with sowing and reaping,\nsubsisted, by hook and by crook, for about a year or two, when he became\nmore impoverished.\n\nIn his presence, Feng Su would readily give vent to specious utterances,\nwhile, with others, and behind his back, he on the contrary expressed\nhis indignation against his improvidence in his mode of living, and\nagainst his sole delight of eating and playing the lazy.\n\nShih-yin, aware of the want of harmony with his father-in-law, could not\nhelp giving way, in his own heart, to feelings of regret and pain. In\naddition to this, the fright and vexation which he had undergone the\nyear before, the anguish and suffering (he had had to endure), had\nalready worked havoc (on his constitution); and being a man advanced in\nyears, and assailed by the joint attack of poverty and disease, he at\nlength gradually began to display symptoms of decline.\n\nStrange coincidence, as he, on this day, came leaning on his staff and\nwith considerable strain, as far as the street for a little relaxation,\nhe suddenly caught sight, approaching from the off side, of a Taoist\npriest with a crippled foot; his maniac appearance so repulsive, his\nshoes of straw, his dress all in tatters, muttering several sentiments\nto this effect:\n\n  All men spiritual life know to be good,\n  But fame to disregard they ne'er succeed!\n  From old till now the statesmen where are they?\n  Waste lie their graves, a heap of grass, extinct.\n  All men spiritual life know to be good,\n  But to forget gold, silver, ill succeed!\n  Through life they grudge their hoardings to be scant,\n  And when plenty has come, their eyelids close.\n  All men spiritual life hold to be good,\n  Yet to forget wives, maids, they ne'er succeed!\n  Who speak of grateful love while lives their lord,\n  And dead their lord, another they pursue.\n  All men spiritual life know to be good,\n  But sons and grandsons to forget never succeed!\n  From old till now of parents soft many,\n  But filial sons and grandsons who have seen?\n\nShih-yin upon hearing these words, hastily came up to the priest, \"What\nwere you so glibly holding forth?\" he inquired. \"All I could hear were a\nlot of hao liao (excellent, finality.\")\n\n\"You may well have heard the two words 'hao liao,'\" answered the Taoist\nwith a smile, \"but can you be said to have fathomed their meaning? You\nshould know that all things in this world are excellent, when they have\nattained finality; when they have attained finality, they are excellent;\nbut when they have not attained finality, they are not excellent; if\nthey would be excellent, they should attain finality. My song is\nentitled Excellent-finality (hao liao).\"\n\nShih-yin was gifted with a natural perspicacity that enabled him, as\nsoon as he heard these remarks, to grasp their spirit.\n\n\"Wait a while,\" he therefore said smilingly; \"let me unravel this\nexcellent-finality song of yours; do you mind?\"\n\n\"Please by all means go on with the interpretation,\" urged the Taoist;\nwhereupon Shih-yin proceeded in this strain:\n\n  Sordid rooms and vacant courts,\n  Replete in years gone by with beds where statesmen lay;\n  Parched grass and withered banian trees,\n  Where once were halls for song and dance!\n  Spiders' webs the carved pillars intertwine,\n  The green gauze now is also pasted on the straw windows!\n  What about the cosmetic fresh concocted or the powder just scented;\n  Why has the hair too on each temple become white like hoarfrost!\n  Yesterday the tumulus of yellow earth buried the bleached bones,\n  To-night under the red silk curtain reclines the couple!\n  Gold fills the coffers, silver fills the boxes,\n  But in a twinkle, the beggars will all abuse you!\n  While you deplore that the life of others is not long,\n  You forget that you yourself are approaching death!\n  You educate your sons with all propriety,\n  But they may some day, 'tis hard to say become thieves;\n  Though you choose (your fare and home) the fatted beam,\n  You may, who can say, fall into some place of easy virtue!\n  Through your dislike of the gauze hat as mean,\n  You have come to be locked in a cangue;\n  Yesterday, poor fellow, you felt cold in a tattered coat,\n  To-day, you despise the purple embroidered dress as long!\n  Confusion reigns far and wide! you have just sung your part, I come on\n      the boards,\n  Instead of yours, you recognise another as your native land;\n  What utter perversion!\n  In one word, it comes to this we make wedding clothes for others!\n  (We sow for others to reap.)\n\nThe crazy limping Taoist clapped his hands. \"Your interpretation is\nexplicit,\" he remarked with a hearty laugh, \"your interpretation is\nexplicit!\"\n\nShih-yin promptly said nothing more than,--\"Walk on;\" and seizing the\nstole from the Taoist's shoulder, he flung it over his own. He did not,\nhowever, return home, but leisurely walked away, in company with the\neccentric priest.\n\nThe report of his disappearance was at once bruited abroad, and plunged\nthe whole neighbourhood in commotion; and converted into a piece of\nnews, it was circulated from mouth to mouth.\n\nDame Feng, Shih-yin's wife, upon hearing the tidings, had such a fit of\nweeping that she hung between life and death; but her only alternative\nwas to consult with her father, and to despatch servants on all sides to\ninstitute inquiries. No news was however received of him, and she had\nnothing else to do but to practise resignation, and to remain dependent\nupon the support of her parents for her subsistence. She had fortunately\nstill by her side, to wait upon her, two servant girls, who had been\nwith her in days gone by; and the three of them, mistress as well as\nservants, occupied themselves day and night with needlework, to assist\nher father in his daily expenses.\n\nThis Feng Su had after all, in spite of his daily murmurings against his\nbad luck, no help but to submit to the inevitable.\n\nOn a certain day, the elder servant girl of the Chen family was at the\ndoor purchasing thread, and while there, she of a sudden heard in the\nstreet shouts of runners clearing the way, and every one explain that\nthe new magistrate had come to take up his office.\n\nThe girl, as she peeped out from inside the door, perceived the lictors\nand policemen go by two by two; and when unexpectedly in a state chair,\nwas carried past an official, in black hat and red coat, she was indeed\nquite taken aback.\n\n\"The face of this officer would seem familiar,\" she argued within\nherself; \"just as if I had seen him somewhere or other ere this.\"\n\nShortly she entered the house, and banishing at once the occurrence from\nher mind, she did not give it a second thought. At night, however, while\nshe was waiting to go to bed, she suddenly heard a sound like a rap at\nthe door. A band of men boisterously cried out: \"We are messengers,\ndeputed by the worthy magistrate of this district, and come to summon\none of you to an enquiry.\"\n\nFeng Su, upon hearing these words, fell into such a terrible\nconsternation that his eyes stared wide and his mouth gaped.\n\nWhat calamity was impending is not as yet ascertained, but, reader,\nlisten to the explanation contained in the next chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n  The spirit of Mrs. Chia Shih-yin departs from the town of Yang Chou.\n  Leng Tzu-hsing dilates upon the Jung Kuo Mansion.\n\n\nTo continue. Feng Su, upon hearing the shouts of the public messengers,\ncame out in a flurry and forcing a smile, he asked them to explain\n(their errand); but all these people did was to continue bawling out:\n\"Be quick, and ask Mr. Chen to come out.\"\n\n\"My surname is Feng,\" said Feng Su, as he promptly forced himself to\nsmile; \"It is'nt Chen at all: I had once a son-in-law whose surname was\nChen, but he has left home, it is now already a year or two back. Is it\nperchance about him that you are inquiring?\"\n\nTo which the public servants remarked: \"We know nothing about Chen or\nChia (true or false); but as he is your son-in-law, we'll take you at\nonce along with us to make verbal answer to our master and have done\nwith it.\"\n\nAnd forthwith the whole bevy of public servants hustled Feng Su on, as\nthey went on their way back; while every one in the Feng family was\nseized with consternation, and could not imagine what it was all about.\n\nIt was no earlier than the second watch, when Feng Su returned home; and\nthey, one and all, pressed him with questions as to what had happened.\n\n\"The fact is,\" he explained, \"the newly-appointed Magistrate, whose\nsurname is Chia, whose name is Huo and who is a native of Hu-chow, has\nbeen on intimate terms, in years gone by, with our son-in-law; that at\nthe sight of the girl Chiao Hsing, standing at the door, in the act of\nbuying thread, he concluded that he must have shifted his quarters over\nhere, and hence it was that his messengers came to fetch him. I gave him\na clear account of the various circumstances (of his misfortunes), and\nthe Magistrate was for a time much distressed and expressed his regret.\nHe then went on to make inquiries about my grand-daughter, and I\nexplained that she had been lost, while looking at the illuminations.\n'No matter,' put in the Magistrate, 'I will by and by order my men to\nmake search, and I feel certain that they will find her and bring her\nback.' Then ensued a short conversation, after which I was about to go,\nwhen he presented me with the sum of two taels.\"\n\nThe mistress of the Chen family (Mrs. Chen Shih-yin) could not but feel\nvery much affected by what she heard, and the whole evening she uttered\nnot a word.\n\nThe next day, at an early hour, Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un sent some of his men to bring\nover to Chen's wife presents, consisting of two packets of silver, and\nfour pieces of brocaded silk, as a token of gratitude, and to Feng Su\nalso a confidential letter, requesting him to ask of Mrs. Chen her maid\nChiao Hsing to become his second wife.\n\nFeng Su was so intensely delighted that his eyebrows expanded, his eyes\nsmiled, and he felt eager to toady to the Magistrate (by presenting the\ngirl to him). He hastened to employ all his persuasive powers with his\ndaughter (to further his purpose), and on the same evening he forthwith\nescorted Chiao Hsing in a small chair to the Yam\u00c3\u00aan.\n\nThe joy experienced by Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un need not be dilated upon. He also\npresented Feng Su with a packet containing one hundred ounces of gold;\nand sent numerous valuable presents to Mrs. Chen, enjoining her \"to live\ncheerfully in the anticipation of finding out the whereabouts of her\ndaughter.\"\n\nIt must be explained, however, that the maid Chi'ao Hsing was the very\nperson, who, a few years ago, had looked round at Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un and who, by\none simple, unpremeditated glance, evolved, in fact, this extraordinary\ndestiny which was indeed an event beyond conception.\n\nWho would ever have foreseen that fate and fortune would both have so\nfavoured her that she should, contrary to all anticipation, give birth\nto a son, after living with Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un barely a year, that in addition to\nthis, after the lapse of another half year, Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un's wife should have\ncontracted a sudden illness and departed this life, and that Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un\nshould have at once raised her to the rank of first wife. Her destiny is\nadequately expressed by the lines:\n\n  Through but one single, casual look\n  Soon an exalted place she took.\n\nThe fact is that after Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un had been presented with the money by\nShih-yin, he promptly started on the 16th day for the capital, and at\nthe triennial great tripos, his wishes were gratified to the full.\nHaving successfully carried off his degree of graduate of the third\nrank, his name was put by selection on the list for provincial\nappointments. By this time, he had been raised to the rank of Magistrate\nin this district; but, in spite of the excellence and sufficiency of his\naccomplishments and abilities, he could not escape being ambitious and\noverbearing. He failed besides, confident as he was in his own merits,\nin respect toward his superiors, with the result that these officials\nlooked upon him scornfully with the corner of the eye.\n\nA year had hardly elapsed, when he was readily denounced in a memorial\nto the Throne by the High Provincial authorities, who represented that\nhe was of a haughty disposition, that he had taken upon himself to\nintroduce innovations in the rites and ceremonies, that overtly, while\nhe endeavoured to enjoy the reputation of probity and uprightness, he,\nsecretly, combined the nature of the tiger and wolf; with the\nconsequence that he had been the cause of much trouble in the district,\nand that he had made life intolerable for the people, &c. &c.\n\nThe Dragon countenance of the Emperor was considerably incensed. His\nMajesty lost no time in issuing commands, in reply to the Memorial, that\nhe should be deprived of his official status.\n\nOn the arrival of the despatch from the Board, great was the joy felt by\nevery officer, without exception, of the prefecture in which he had held\noffice. Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un, though at heart intensely mortified and incensed,\nbetrayed not the least outward symptom of annoyance, but still\npreserved, as of old, a smiling and cheerful countenance.\n\nHe handed over charge of all official business and removed the savings\nwhich he had accumulated during the several years he had been in office,\nhis family and all his chattels to his original home; where, after\nhaving put everything in proper order, he himself travelled (carried the\nwinds and sleeved the moon) far and wide, visiting every relic of note\nin the whole Empire.\n\nAs luck would have it, on a certain day while making a second journey\nthrough the Wei Yang district, he heard the news that the Salt\nCommissioner appointed this year was Lin Ju-hai. This Lin Ju-hai's\nfamily name was Lin, his name Hai and his style Ju-hai. He had obtained\nthe third place in the previous triennial examination, and had, by this\ntime, already risen to the rank of Director of the Court of Censors. He\nwas a native of K\u00c3\u00ba Su. He had been recently named by Imperial\nappointment a Censor attached to the Salt Inspectorate, and had arrived\nat his post only a short while back.\n\nIn fact, the ancestors of Lin Ju-hai had, from years back, successively\ninherited the title of Marquis, which rank, by its present descent to\nJu-hai, had already been enjoyed by five generations. When first\nconferred, the hereditary right to the title had been limited to three\ngenerations; but of late years, by an act of magnanimous favour and\ngenerous beneficence, extraordinary bounty had been superadded; and on\nthe arrival of the succession to the father of Ju-hai, the right had\nbeen extended to another degree. It had now descended to Ju-hai, who\nhad, besides this title of nobility, begun his career as a successful\ngraduate. But though his family had been through uninterrupted ages the\nrecipient of imperial bounties, his kindred had all been anyhow men of\nculture.\n\nThe only misfortune had been that the several branches of the Lin family\nhad not been prolific, so that the numbers of its members continued\nlimited; and though there existed several households, they were all\nhowever to Ju-hai no closer relatives than first cousins. Neither were\nthere any connections of the same lineage, or of the same parentage.\n\nJu-hai was at this date past forty; and had only had a son, who had died\nthe previous year, in the third year of his age. Though he had several\nhandmaids, he had not had the good fortune of having another son; but\nthis was too a matter that could not be remedied.\n\nBy his wife, n\u00c3\u00a9e Chia, he had a daughter, to whom the infant name of Tai\nY\u00c3\u00bc was given. She was, at this time, in her fifth year. Upon her the\nparents doated as much as if she were a brilliant pearl in the palm of\ntheir hand. Seeing that she was endowed with natural gifts of\nintelligence and good looks, they also felt solicitous to bestow upon\nher a certain knowledge of books, with no other purpose than that of\nsatisfying, by this illusory way, their wishes of having a son to\nnurture and of dispelling the anguish felt by them, on account of the\ndesolation and void in their family circle (round their knees).\n\nBut to proceed. Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un, while sojourning at an inn, was unexpectedly\nlaid up with a violent chill. Finding on his recovery, that his funds\nwere not sufficient to pay his expenses, he was thinking of looking out\nfor some house where he could find a resting place when he suddenly came\nacross two friends acquainted with the new Salt Commissioner. Knowing\nthat this official was desirous to find a tutor to instruct his\ndaughter, they lost no time in recommending Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un, who moved into the\nYam\u00c3\u00aan.\n\nHis female pupil was youthful in years and delicate in physique, so that\nher lessons were irregular. Besides herself, there were only two waiting\ngirls, who remained in attendance during the hours of study, so that\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un was spared considerable trouble and had a suitable opportunity\nto attend to the improvement of his health.\n\nIn a twinkle, another year and more slipped by, and when least expected,\nthe mother of his ward, n\u00c3\u00a9e Chia, was carried away after a short\nillness. His pupil (during her mother's sickness) was dutiful in her\nattendance, and prepared the medicines for her use. (And after her\ndeath,) she went into the deepest mourning prescribed by the rites, and\ngave way to such excess of grief that, naturally delicate as she was,\nher old complaint, on this account, broke out anew.\n\nBeing unable for a considerable time to prosecute her studies, Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un\nlived at leisure and had no duties to attend to. Whenever therefore the\nwind was genial and the sun mild, he was wont to stroll at random, after\nhe had done with his meals.\n\nOn this particular day, he, by some accident, extended his walk beyond\nthe suburbs, and desirous to contemplate the nature of the rustic\nscenery, he, with listless step, came up to a spot encircled by hills\nand streaming pools, by luxuriant clumps of trees and thick groves of\nbamboos. Nestling in the dense foliage stood a temple. The doors and\ncourts were in ruins. The walls, inner and outer, in disrepair. An\ninscription on a tablet testified that this was the temple of Spiritual\nPerception. On the sides of the door was also a pair of old and\ndilapidated scrolls with the following enigmatical verses.\n\n  Behind ample there is, yet to retract the hand, the mind heeds not,\n      until.\n  Before the mortal vision lies no path, when comes to turn the will.\n\n\"These two sentences,\" Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un pondered after perusal, \"although simple\nin language, are profound in signification. I have previous to this\nvisited many a spacious temple, located on hills of note, but never have\nI beheld an inscription referring to anything of the kind. The meaning\ncontained in these words must, I feel certain, owe their origin to the\nexperiences of some person or other; but there's no saying. But why\nshould I not go in and inquire for myself?\"\n\nUpon walking in, he at a glance caught sight of no one else, but of a\nvery aged bonze, of unkempt appearance, cooking his rice. When Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un\nperceived that he paid no notice, he went up to him and asked him one or\ntwo questions, but as the old priest was dull of hearing and a dotard,\nand as he had lost his teeth, and his tongue was blunt, he made most\nirrelevant replies.\n\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un lost all patience with him, and withdrew again from the\ncompound with the intention of going as far as the village public house\nto have a drink or two, so as to enhance the enjoyment of the rustic\nscenery. With easy stride, he accordingly walked up to the place.\nScarcely had he passed the threshold of the public house, when he\nperceived some one or other among the visitors who had been sitting\nsipping their wine on the divan, jump up and come up to greet him, with\na face beaming with laughter.\n\n\"What a strange meeting! What a strange meeting!\" he exclaimed aloud.\n\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un speedily looked at him, (and remembered) that this person had,\nin past days, carried on business in a curio establishment in the\ncapital, and that his surname was Leng and his style Tzu-hsing.\n\nA mutual friendship had existed between them during their sojourn, in\ndays of yore, in the capital; and as Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un had entertained the\nhighest opinion of Leng Tzu-hsing, as being a man of action and of great\nabilities, while this Leng Tzu-hsing, on the other hand, borrowed of the\nreputation of refinement enjoyed by Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un, the two had consequently\nall along lived in perfect harmony and companionship.\n\n\"When did you get here?\" Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un eagerly inquired also smilingly. \"I\nwasn't in the least aware of your arrival. This unexpected meeting is\npositively a strange piece of good fortune.\"\n\n\"I went home,\" Tzu-hsing replied, \"about the close of last year, but now\nas I am again bound to the capital, I passed through here on my way to\nlook up a friend of mine and talk some matters over. He had the kindness\nto press me to stay with him for a couple of days longer, and as I after\nall have no urgent business to attend to, I am tarrying a few days, but\npurpose starting about the middle of the moon. My friend is busy to-day,\nso I roamed listlessly as far as here, never dreaming of such a\nfortunate meeting.\"\n\nWhile speaking, he made Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un sit down at the same table, and ordered\na fresh supply of wine and eatables; and as the two friends chatted of\none thing and another, they slowly sipped their wine.\n\nThe conversation ran on what had occurred after the separation, and\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un inquired, \"Is there any news of any kind in the capital?\"\n\n\"There's nothing new whatever,\" answered Tzu-hsing. \"There is one thing\nhowever: in the family of one of your worthy kinsmen, of the same name\nas yourself, a trifling, but yet remarkable, occurrence has taken\nplace.\"\n\n\"None of my kindred reside in the capital,\" rejoined Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un with a\nsmile. \"To what can you be alluding?\"\n\n\"How can it be that you people who have the same surname do not belong\nto one clan?\" remarked Tzu-hsing, sarcastically.\n\n\"In whose family?\" inquired Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un.\n\n\"The Chia family,\" replied Tzu-hsing smiling, \"whose quarters are in the\nJung Kuo Mansion, does not after all reflect discredit upon the lintel\nof your door, my venerable friend.\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un, \"did this affair take place in that family?\nWere we to begin reckoning, we would find the members of my clan to be\nanything but limited in number. Since the time of our ancestor Chia Fu,\nwho lived while the Eastern Han dynasty occupied the Throne, the\nbranches of our family have been numerous and flourishing; they are now\nto be found in every single province, and who could, with any accuracy,\nascertain their whereabouts? As regards the Jung-kuo branch in\nparticular, their names are in fact inscribed on the same register as\nour own, but rich and exalted as they are, we have never presumed to\nclaim them as our relatives, so that we have become more and more\nestranged.\"\n\n\"Don't make any such assertions,\" Tzu-hsing remarked with a sigh, \"the\npresent two mansions of Jung and Ning have both alike also suffered\nreverses, and they cannot come up to their state of days of yore.\"\n\n\"Up to this day, these two households of Ning and of Jung,\" Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un\nsuggested, \"still maintain a very large retinue of people, and how can\nit be that they have met with reverses?\"\n\n\"To explain this would be indeed a long story,\" said Leng Tzu-hsing.\n\"Last year,\" continued Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un, \"I arrived at Chin Ling, as I\nentertained a wish to visit the remains of interest of the six\ndynasties, and as I on that day entered the walled town of Shih T'ou, I\npassed by the entrance of that old residence. On the east side of the\nstreet, stood the Ning Kuo mansion; on the west the Jung Kuo mansion;\nand these two, adjoining each other as they do, cover in fact well-nigh\nhalf of the whole length of the street. Outside the front gate\neverything was, it is true, lonely and deserted; but at a glance into\nthe interior over the enclosing wall, I perceived that the halls,\npavilions, two-storied structures and porches presented still a majestic\nand lofty appearance. Even the flower garden, which extends over the\nwhole area of the back grounds, with its trees and rockeries, also\npossessed to that day an air of luxuriance and freshness, which betrayed\nno signs of a ruined or decrepid establishment.\"\n\n\"You have had the good fortune of starting in life as a graduate,\"\nexplained Tzu-tsing as he smiled, \"and yet are not aware of the saying\nuttered by some one of old: that a centipede even when dead does not lie\nstiff. (These families) may, according to your version, not be up to the\nprosperity of former years, but, compared with the family of an ordinary\nofficial, their condition anyhow presents a difference. Of late the\nnumber of the inmates has, day by day, been on the increase; their\naffairs have become daily more numerous; of masters and servants, high\nand low, who live in ease and respectability very many there are; but of\nthose who exercise any forethought, or make any provision, there is not\neven one. In their daily wants, their extravagances, and their\nexpenditure, they are also unable to adapt themselves to circumstances\nand practise economy; (so that though) the present external framework\nmay not have suffered any considerable collapse, their purses have\nanyhow begun to feel an exhausting process! But this is a mere trifle.\nThere is another more serious matter. Would any one ever believe that in\nsuch families of official status, in a clan of education and culture,\nthe sons and grandsons of the present age would after all be each\n(succeeding) generation below the standard of the former?\"\n\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un, having listened to these remarks, observed: \"How ever can it\nbe possible that families of such education and refinement can observe\nany system of training and nurture which is not excellent? Concerning\nthe other branches, I am not in a position to say anything; but\nrestricting myself to the two mansions of Jung and Ning, they are those\nin which, above all others, the education of their children is\nmethodical.\"\n\n\"I was just now alluding to none other than these two establishments,\"\nTzu-hsing observed with a sigh; \"but let me tell you all. In days of\nyore, the duke of Ning Kuo and the duke of Jung Kuo were two uterine\nbrothers. The Ning duke was the elder; he had four sons. After the death\nof the duke of Ning Kuo, his eldest son, Chia Tai-hua, came into the\ntitle. He also had two sons; but the eldest, whose name was Hu, died at\nthe age of eight or nine; and the only survivor, the second son, Chia\nChing, inherited the title. His whole mind is at this time set upon\nTaoist doctrines; his sole delight is to burn the pill and refine the\ndual powers; while every other thought finds no place in his mind.\nHappily, he had, at an early age, left a son, Chia Chen, behind in the\nlay world, and his father, engrossed as his whole heart was with the\nidea of attaining spiritual life, ceded the succession of the official\ntitle to him. His parent is, besides, not willing to return to the\noriginal family seat, but lives outside the walls of the capital,\nfoolishly hobnobbing with all the Taoist priests. This Mr. Chen had also\na son, Chia Jung, who is, at this period, just in his sixteenth year.\nMr. Ching gives at present no attention to anything at all, so that Mr.\nChen naturally devotes no time to his studies, but being bent upon\nnought else but incessant high pleasure, he has subversed the order of\nthings in the Ning Kuo mansion, and yet no one can summon the courage to\ncome and hold him in check. But I'll now tell you about the Jung mansion\nfor your edification. The strange occurrence, to which I alluded just\nnow, came about in this manner. After the demise of the Jung duke, the\neldest son, Chia Tai-shan, inherited the rank. He took to himself as\nwife, the daughter of Marquis Shih, a noble family of Chin Ling, by whom\nhe had two sons; the elder being Chia She, the younger Chia Cheng. This\nTai Shan is now dead long ago; but his wife is still alive, and the\nelder son, Chia She, succeeded to the degree. He is a man of amiable and\ngenial disposition, but he likewise gives no thought to the direction of\nany domestic concern. The second son Chia Cheng displayed, from his\nearly childhood, a great liking for books, and grew up to be correct and\nupright in character. His grandfather doated upon him, and would have\nhad him start in life through the arena of public examinations, but,\nwhen least expected, Tai-shan, being on the point of death, bequeathed a\npetition, which was laid before the Emperor. His Majesty, out of regard\nfor his former minister, issued immediate commands that the elder son\nshould inherit the estate, and further inquired how many sons there were\nbesides him, all of whom he at once expressed a wish to be introduced in\nhis imperial presence. His Majesty, moreover, displayed exceptional\nfavour, and conferred upon Mr. Cheng the brevet rank of second class\nAssistant Secretary (of a Board), and commanded him to enter the Board\nto acquire the necessary experience. He has already now been promoted to\nthe office of second class Secretary. This Mr. Cheng's wife, n\u00c3\u00a8e Wang,\nfirst gave birth to a son called Chia Chu, who became a Licentiate in\nhis fourteenth year. At barely twenty, he married, but fell ill and died\nsoon after the birth of a son. Her (Mrs. Cheng's) second child was a\ndaughter, who came into the world, by a strange coincidence, on the\nfirst day of the year. She had an unexpected (pleasure) in the birth,\nthe succeeding year, of another son, who, still more remarkable to say,\nhad, at the time of his birth, a piece of variegated and crystal-like\nbrilliant jade in his mouth, on which were yet visible the outlines of\nseveral characters. Now, tell me, was not this a novel and strange\noccurrence? eh?\"\n\n\"Strange indeed!\" exclaimed Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un with a smile; \"but I presume the\ncoming experiences of this being will not be mean.\"\n\nTzu-hsing gave a faint smile. \"One and all,\" he remarked, \"entertain the\nsame idea. Hence it is that his mother doats upon him like upon a\nprecious jewel. On the day of his first birthday, Mr. Cheng readily\nentertained a wish to put the bent of his inclinations to the test, and\nplaced before the child all kinds of things, without number, for him to\ngrasp from. Contrary to every expectation, he scorned every other\nobject, and, stretching forth his hand, he simply took hold of rouge,\npowder and a few hair-pins, with which he began to play. Mr. Cheng\nexperienced at once displeasure, as he maintained that this youth would,\nby and bye, grow up into a sybarite, devoted to wine and women, and for\nthis reason it is, that he soon began to feel not much attachment for\nhim. But his grandmother is the one who, in spite of everything, prizes\nhim like the breath of her own life. The very mention of what happened\nis even strange! He is now grown up to be seven or eight years old, and,\nalthough exceptionally wilful, in intelligence and precocity, however,\nnot one in a hundred could come up to him! And as for the utterances of\nthis child, they are no less remarkable. The bones and flesh of woman,\nhe argues, are made of water, while those of man of mud. 'Women to my\neyes are pure and pleasing,' he says, 'while at the sight of man, I\nreadily feel how corrupt, foul and repelling they are!' Now tell me, are\nnot these words ridiculous? There can be no doubt whatever that he will\nby and bye turn out to be a licentious rou\u00c3\u00a9.\"\n\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un, whose countenance suddenly assumed a stern air, promptly\ninterrupted the conversation. \"It doesn't quite follow,\" he suggested.\n\"You people don't, I regret to say, understand the destiny of this\nchild. The fact is that even the old Hanlin scholar Mr. Cheng was\nerroneously looked upon as a loose rake and dissolute debauchee! But\nunless a person, through much study of books and knowledge of letters,\nso increases (in lore) as to attain the talent of discerning the nature\nof things, and the vigour of mind to fathom the Taoist reason as well as\nto comprehend the first principle, he is not in a position to form any\njudgment.\"\n\nTzu-hsing upon perceiving the weighty import of what he propounded,\n\"Please explain,\" he asked hastily, \"the drift (of your argument).\" To\nwhich Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un responded: \"Of the human beings created by the operation\nof heaven and earth, if we exclude those who are gifted with extreme\nbenevolence and extreme viciousness, the rest, for the most part,\npresent no striking diversity. If they be extremely benevolent, they\nfall in, at the time of their birth, with an era of propitious fortune;\nwhile those extremely vicious correspond, at the time of their\nexistence, with an era of calamity. When those who coexist with\npropitious fortune come into life, the world is in order; when those who\ncoexist with unpropitious fortune come into life, the world is in\ndanger. Yao, Shun, Y\u00c3\u00bc, Ch'eng T'ang, Wen Wang, Wu Wang, Chou Kung, Chao\nKung, Confucius, Mencius, T'ung Hu, Han Hsin, Chou Tzu, Ch'eng Tzu, Chu\nTzu and Chang Tzu were ordained to see light in an auspicious era.\nWhereas Ch'i Yu, Kung Kung, Chieh Wang, Chou Wang, Shih Huang, Wang\nMang, Tsao Ts'ao, Wen Wen, An Hu-shan, Ch'in Kuei and others were one\nand all destined to come into the world during a calamitous age. Those\nendowed with extreme benevolence set the world in order; those possessed\nof extreme maliciousness turn the world into disorder. Purity,\nintelligence, spirituality and subtlety constitute the vital spirit of\nright which pervades heaven and earth, and the persons gifted with\nbenevolence are its natural fruit. Malignity and perversity constitute\nthe spirit of evil, which permeates heaven and earth, and malicious\npersons are affected by its influence. The days of perpetual happiness\nand eminent good fortune, and the era of perfect peace and tranquility,\nwhich now prevail, are the offspring of the pure, intelligent, divine\nand subtle spirit which ascends above, to the very Emperor, and below\nreaches the rustic and uncultured classes. Every one is without\nexception under its influence. The superfluity of the subtle spirit\nexpands far and wide, and finding nowhere to betake itself to, becomes,\nin due course, transformed into dew, or gentle breeze; and, by a process\nof diffusion, it pervades the whole world.\n\n\"The spirit of malignity and perversity, unable to expand under the\nbrilliant sky and transmuting sun, eventually coagulates, pervades and\nstops up the deep gutters and extensive caverns; and when of a sudden\nthe wind agitates it or it be impelled by the clouds, and any slight\ndisposition, on its part, supervenes to set itself in motion, or to\nbreak its bounds, and so little as even the minutest fraction does\nunexpectedly find an outlet, and happens to come across any spirit of\nperception and subtlety which may be at the time passing by, the spirit\nof right does not yield to the spirit of evil, and the spirit of evil is\nagain envious of the spirit of right, so that the two do not harmonize.\nJust like wind, water, thunder and lightning, which, when they meet in\nthe bowels of the earth, must necessarily, as they are both to dissolve\nand are likewise unable to yield, clash and explode to the end that they\nmay at length exhaust themselves. Hence it is that these spirits have\nalso forcibly to diffuse themselves into the human race to find an\noutlet, so that they may then completely disperse, with the result that\nmen and women are suddenly imbued with these spirits and spring into\nexistence. At best, (these human beings) cannot be generated into\nphilanthropists or perfect men; at worst, they cannot also embody\nextreme perversity or extreme wickedness. Yet placed among one million\nbeings, the spirit of intelligence, refinement, perception and subtlety\nwill be above these one million beings; while, on the other hand, the\nperverse, depraved and inhuman embodiment will likewise be below the\nmillion of men. Born in a noble and wealthy family, these men will be a\nsalacious, lustful lot; born of literary, virtuous or poor parentage,\nthey will turn out retired scholars or men of mark; though they may by\nsome accident be born in a destitute and poverty-stricken home, they\ncannot possibly, in fact, ever sink so low as to become runners or\nmenials, or contentedly brook to be of the common herd or to be driven\nand curbed like a horse in harness. They will become, for a certainty,\neither actors of note or courtesans of notoriety; as instanced in former\nyears by Hs\u00c3\u00bc Yu, T'ao Ch'ien, Yuan Chi, Chi Kang, Liu Ling, the two\nfamilies of Wang and Hsieh, Ku Hu-t'ou, Ch'en Hou-chu, T'ang Ming-huang,\nSung Hui-tsung, Liu T'ing-chih, Wen Fei-ching, Mei Nan-kung, Shih\nMan-ch'ing, Lui C'hih-ch'ing and Chin Shao-yu, and exemplified\nnow-a-days by Ni Y\u00c3\u00bcn-lin, T'ang Po-hu, Chu Chih-shan, and also by Li\nKuei-men, Huang P'an-cho, Ching Hsin-mo, Cho Wen-ch\u00c3\u00bcn; and the women\nHung Fu, Hsieh T'ao, Ch'\u00c3\u00bc Ying, Ch'ao Y\u00c3\u00bcn and others; all of whom were\nand are of the same stamp, though placed in different scenes of action.\"\n\n\"From what you say,\" observed Tzu-hsing, \"success makes (a man) a duke\nor a marquis; ruin, a thief!\"\n\n\"Quite so; that's just my idea!\" replied Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un; \"I've not as yet let\nyou know that after my degradation from office, I spent the last couple\nof years in travelling for pleasure all over each province, and that I\nalso myself came across two extraordinary youths. This is why, when a\nshort while back you alluded to this Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, I at once conjectured, with\na good deal of certainty, that he must be a human being of the same\nstamp. There's no need for me to speak of any farther than the walled\ncity of Chin Ling. This Mr. Chen was, by imperial appointment, named\nPrincipal of the Government Public College of the Chin Ling province. Do\nyou perhaps know him?\"\n\n\"Who doesn't know him?\" remarked Tzu-hsing. \"This Chen family is an old\nconnection of the Chia family. These two families were on terms of great\nintimacy, and I myself likewise enjoyed the pleasure of their friendship\nfor many a day.\"\n\n\"Last year, when at Chin Ling,\" Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un continued with a smile, \"some\none recommended me as resident tutor to the school in the Chen mansion;\nand when I moved into it I saw for myself the state of things. Who would\never think that that household was grand and luxurious to such a degree!\nBut they are an affluent family, and withal full of propriety, so that a\nschool like this was of course not one easy to obtain. The pupil,\nhowever, was, it is true, a young tyro, but far more troublesome to\nteach than a candidate for the examination of graduate of the second\ndegree. Were I to enter into details, you would indeed have a laugh. 'I\nmust needs,' he explained, 'have the company of two girls in my studies\nto enable me to read at all, and to keep likewise my brain clear.\nOtherwise, if left to myself, my head gets all in a muddle.' Time after\ntime, he further expounded to his young attendants, how extremely\nhonourable and extremely pure were the two words representing woman,\nthat they are more valuable and precious than the auspicious animal, the\nfelicitous bird, rare flowers and uncommon plants. 'You may not' (he was\nwont to say), 'on any account heedlessly utter them, you set of foul\nmouths and filthy tongues! these two words are of the utmost import!\nWhenever you have occasion to allude to them, you must, before you can\ndo so with impunity, take pure water and scented tea and rinse your\nmouths. In the event of any slip of the tongue, I shall at once have\nyour teeth extracted, and your eyes gouged out.' His obstinacy and\nwaywardness are, in every respect, out of the common. After he was\nallowed to leave school, and to return home, he became, at the sight of\nthe young ladies, so tractable, gentle, sharp, and polite, transformed,\nin fact, like one of them. And though, for this reason, his father has\npunished him on more than one occasion, by giving him a sound thrashing,\nsuch as brought him to the verge of death, he cannot however change.\nWhenever he was being beaten, and could no more endure the pain, he was\nwont to promptly break forth in promiscuous loud shouts, 'Girls! girls!'\nThe young ladies, who heard him from the inner chambers, subsequently\nmade fun of him. 'Why,' they said, 'when you are being thrashed, and you\nare in pain, your only thought is to bawl out girls! Is it perchance\nthat you expect us young ladies to go and intercede for you? How is that\nyou have no sense of shame?' To their taunts he gave a most plausible\nexplanation. 'Once,' he replied, 'when in the agony of pain, I gave vent\nto shouting girls, in the hope, perchance, I did not then know, of its\nbeing able to alleviate the soreness. After I had, with this purpose,\ngiven one cry, I really felt the pain considerably better; and now that\nI have obtained this secret spell, I have recourse, at once, when I am\nin the height of anguish, to shouts of girls, one shout after another.\nNow what do you say to this? Isn't this absurd, eh?\"\n\n\"The grandmother is so infatuated by her extreme tenderness for this\nyouth, that, time after time, she has, on her grandson's account, found\nfault with the tutor, and called her son to task, with the result that I\nresigned my post and took my leave. A youth, with a disposition such as\nhis, cannot assuredly either perpetuate intact the estate of his father\nand grandfather, or follow the injunctions of teacher or advice of\nfriends. The pity is, however, that there are, in that family, several\nexcellent female cousins, the like of all of whom it would be difficult\nto discover.\"\n\n\"Quite so!\" remarked Tzu-hsing; \"there are now three young ladies in the\nChia family who are simply perfection itself. The eldest is a daughter\nof Mr. Cheng, Yuan Ch'un by name, who, on account of her excellence,\nfilial piety, talents, and virtue, has been selected as a governess in\nthe palace. The second is the daughter of Mr. She's handmaid, and is\ncalled Ying Ch'un; the third is T'an Ch'un, the child of Mr. Cheng's\nhandmaid; while the fourth is the uterine sister of Mr. Chen of the Ning\nMansion. Her name is Hsi Ch'un. As dowager lady Shih is so fondly\nattached to her granddaughters, they come, for the most part, over to\ntheir grandmother's place to prosecute their studies together, and each\none of these girls is, I hear, without a fault.\"\n\n\"More admirable,\" observed Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un, \"is the r\u00c3\u00a9gime (adhered to) in the\nChen family, where the names of the female children have all been\nselected from the list of male names, and are unlike all those\nout-of-the-way names, such as Spring Blossom, Scented Gem, and the like\nflowery terms in vogue in other families. But how is it that the Chia\nfamily have likewise fallen into this common practice?\"\n\n\"Not so!\" ventured Tzu-h'sing. \"It is simply because the eldest daughter\nwas born on the first of the first moon, that the name of Yuan Ch'un was\ngiven to her; while with the rest this character Ch'un (spring) was then\nfollowed. The names of the senior generation are, in like manner,\nadopted from those of their brothers; and there is at present an\ninstance in support of this. The wife of your present worthy master, Mr.\nLin, is the uterine sister of Mr. Chia. She and Mr. Chia Cheng, and she\nwent, while at home, under the name of Chia Min. Should you question the\ntruth of what I say, you are at liberty, on your return, to make minute\ninquiries and you'll be convinced.\"\n\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un clapped his hands and said smiling, \"It's so, I know! for this\nfemale pupil of mine, whose name is Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, invariably pronounces the\ncharacter _min_ as _mi_, whenever she comes across it in the\ncourse of her reading; while, in writing, when she comes to the\ncharacter 'min,' she likewise reduces the strokes by one, sometimes by\ntwo. Often have I speculated in my mind (as to the cause), but the\nremarks I've heard you mention, convince me, without doubt, that it is\nno other reason (than that of reverence to her mother's name). Strange\nenough, this pupil of mine is unique in her speech and deportment, and\nin no way like any ordinary young lady. But considering that her mother\nwas no commonplace woman herself, it is natural that she should have\ngiven birth to such a child. Besides, knowing, as I do now, that she is\nthe granddaughter of the Jung family, it is no matter of surprise to me\nthat she is what she is. Poor girl, her mother, after all, died in the\ncourse of the last month.\"\n\nTzu-hsing heaved a sigh. \"Of three elderly sisters,\" he explained, \"this\none was the youngest, and she too is gone! Of the sisters of the senior\ngeneration not one even survives! But now we'll see what the husbands of\nthis younger generation will be like by and bye!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un. \"But some while back you mentioned that Mr.\nCheng has had a son, born with a piece of jade in his mouth, and that he\nhas besides a tender-aged grandson left by his eldest son; but is it\nlikely that this Mr. She has not, himself, as yet, had any male issue?\"\n\n\"After Mr. Cheng had this son with the jade,\" Tzu-hsing added, \"his\nhandmaid gave birth to another son, who whether he be good or bad, I\ndon't at all know. At all events, he has by his side two sons and a\ngrandson, but what these will grow up to be by and bye, I cannot tell.\nAs regards Mr. Chia She, he too has had two sons; the second of whom,\nChia Lien, is by this time about twenty. He took to wife a relative of\nhis, a niece of Mr. Cheng's wife, a Miss Wang, and has now been married\nfor the last two years. This Mr. Lien has lately obtained by purchase\nthe rank of sub-prefect. He too takes little pleasure in books, but as\nfar as worldly affairs go, he is so versatile and glib of tongue, that\nhe has recently taken up his quarters with his uncle Mr. Cheng, to whom\nhe gives a helping hand in the management of domestic matters. Who would\nhave thought it, however, ever since his marriage with his worthy wife,\nnot a single person, whether high or low, has there been who has not\nlooked up to her with regard: with the result that Mr. Lien himself has,\nin fact, had to take a back seat (_lit_. withdrew 35 li). In looks,\nshe is also so extremely beautiful, in speech so extremely quick and\nfluent, in ingenuity so deep and astute, that even a man could, in no\nway, come up to her mark.\"\n\nAfter hearing these remarks Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un smiled. \"You now perceive,\" he\nsaid, \"that my argument is no fallacy, and that the several persons\nabout whom you and I have just been talking are, we may presume, human\nbeings, who, one and all, have been generated by the spirit of right,\nand the spirit of evil, and come to life by the same royal road; but of\ncourse there's no saying.\"\n\n\"Enough,\" cried Tzu-hsing, \"of right and enough of evil; we've been\ndoing nothing but settling other people's accounts; come now, have\nanother glass, and you'll be the better for it!\"\n\n\"While bent upon talking,\" Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un explained, \"I've had more glasses\nthan is good for me.\"\n\n\"Speaking of irrelevant matters about other people,\" Tzu-hsing rejoined\ncomplacently, \"is quite the thing to help us swallow our wine; so come\nnow; what harm will happen, if we do have a few glasses more.\"\n\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un thereupon looked out of the window.\n\n\"The day is also far advanced,\" he remarked, \"and if we don't take care,\nthe gates will be closing; let us leisurely enter the city, and as we go\nalong, there will be nothing to prevent us from continuing our chat.\"\n\nForthwith the two friends rose from their seats, settled and paid their\nwine bill, and were just going, when they unexpectedly heard some one\nfrom behind say with a loud voice:\n\n\"Accept my congratulations, Brother Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un; I've now come, with the\nexpress purpose of giving you the welcome news!\"\n\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un lost no time in turning his head round to look at the speaker.\nBut reader, if you wish to learn who the man was, listen to the details\ngiven in the following chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n  Lin Ju-hai appeals to his brother-in-law, Chia Cheng, recommending\n      Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un, his daughter's tutor, to his consideration.\n  Dowager lady Chia sends to fetch her granddaughter, out of\n      commiseration for her being a motherless child.\n\n\nBut to proceed with our narrative.\n\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un, on speedily turning round, perceived that the speaker was no\nother than a certain Chang Ju-kuei, an old colleague of his, who had\nbeen denounced and deprived of office, on account of some case or other;\na native of that district, who had, since his degradation, resided in\nhis family home.\n\nHaving lately come to hear the news that a memorial, presented in the\ncapital, that the former officers (who had been cashiered) should be\nreinstated, had received the imperial consent, he had promptly done all\nhe could, in every nook and corner, to obtain influence, and to find the\nmeans (of righting his position,) when he, unexpectedly, came across\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un, to whom he therefore lost no time in offering his\ncongratulations. The two friends exchanged the conventional salutations,\nand Chang Ju-kuei forthwith communicated the tidings to Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un.\n\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un was delighted, but after he had made a few remarks, in a great\nhurry, each took his leave and sped on his own way homewards.\n\nLeng Tzu-hsing, upon hearing this conversation, hastened at once to\npropose a plan, advising Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un to request Lin Ju-hai, in his turn, to\nappeal in the capital to Mr. Chia Cheng for support.\n\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un accepted the suggestion, and parted from his companion.\n\nOn his return to his quarters, he made all haste to lay his hand on the\nMetropolitan Gazette, and having ascertained that the news was\nauthentic, he had on the next day a personal consultation with Ju-hai.\n\n\"Providence and good fortune are both alike propitious!\" exclaimed\nJu-hai. \"After the death of my wife, my mother-in-law, whose residence\nis in the capital, was so very solicitous on my daughter's account, for\nhaving no one to depend upon, that she despatched, at an early period,\nboats with men and women servants to come and fetch her. But my child\nwas at the time not quite over her illness, and that is why she has not\nyet started. I was, this very moment, cogitating to send my daughter to\nthe capital. And in view of the obligation, under which I am to you for\nthe instruction you have heretofore conferred upon her, remaining as yet\nunrequited, there is no reason why, when such an opportunity as this\npresents itself, I should not do my utmost to find means to make proper\nacknowledgment. I have already, in anticipation, given the matter my\nattention, and written a letter of recommendation to my brother-in-law,\nurging him to put everything right for you, in order that I may, to a\ncertain extent, be able to give effect to my modest wishes. As for any\noutlay that may prove necessary, I have given proper explanation, in the\nletter to my brother-in-law, so that you, my brother, need not trouble\nyourself by giving way to much anxiety.\"\n\nAs Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un bowed and expressed his appreciation in most profuse\nlanguage,--\n\n\"Pray,\" he asked, \"where does your honoured brother-in-law reside? and\nwhat is his official capacity? But I fear I'm too coarse in my manner,\nand could not presume to obtrude myself in his presence.\"\n\nJu-hai smiled. \"And yet,\" he remarked, \"this brother-in-law of mine is\nafter all of one and the same family as your worthy self, for he is the\ngrandson of the Duke Jung. My elder brother-in-law has now inherited the\nstatus of Captain-General of the first grade. His name is She, his style\nNgen-hou. My second brother-in-law's name is Cheng, his style is\nTzu-chou. His present post is that of a Second class Secretary in the\nBoard of Works. He is modest and kindhearted, and has much in him of the\nhabits of his grandfather; not one of that purse-proud and haughty kind\nof men. That is why I have written to him and made the request on your\nbehalf. Were he different to what he really is, not only would he cast a\nslur upon your honest purpose, honourable brother, but I myself likewise\nwould not have been as prompt in taking action.\"\n\nWhen Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un heard these remarks, he at length credited what had been\ntold him by Tzu-hsing the day before, and he lost no time in again\nexpressing his sense of gratitude to Lin Ju-hai.\n\nJu-hai resumed the conversation.\n\n\"I have fixed,\" (he explained,) \"upon the second of next month, for my\nyoung daughter's departure for the capital, and, if you, brother mine,\nwere to travel along with her, would it not be an advantage to herself,\nas well as to yourself?\"\n\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un signified his acquiescence as he listened to his proposal;\nfeeling in his inner self extremely elated.\n\nJu-hai availed himself of the earliest opportunity to get ready the\npresents (for the capital) and all the requirements for the journey,\nwhich (when completed,) Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un took over one by one. His pupil could\nnot, at first, brook the idea, of a separation from her father, but the\npressing wishes of her grandmother left her no course (but to comply).\n\n\"Your father,\" Ju-hai furthermore argued with her, \"is already fifty;\nand I entertain no wish to marry again; and then you are always ailing;\nbesides, with your extreme youth, you have, above, no mother of your own\nto take care of you, and below, no sisters to attend to you. If you now\ngo and have your maternal grandmother, as well as your mother's brothers\nand your cousins to depend upon, you will be doing the best thing to\nreduce the anxiety which I feel in my heart on your behalf. Why then\nshould you not go?\"\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc, after listening to what her father had to say, parted from him\nin a flood of tears and followed her nurse and several old matrons from\nthe Jung mansion on board her boat, and set out on her journey.\n\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un had a boat to himself, and with two youths to wait on him, he\nprosecuted his voyage in the wake of Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc.\n\nBy a certain day, they reached Ching Tu; and Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un, after first\nadjusting his hat and clothes, came, attended by a youth, to the door of\nthe Jung mansion, and sent in a card, which showed his lineage.\n\nChia Cheng had, by this time, perused his brother-in-law's letter, and\nhe speedily asked him to walk in. When they met, he found in Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un an\nimposing manner and polite address.\n\nThis Chia Cheng had, in fact, a great penchant above all things for men\nof education, men courteous to the talented, respectful to the learned,\nready to lend a helping hand to the needy and to succour the distressed,\nand was, to a great extent, like his grandfather. As it was besides a\nwish intimated by his brother-in-law, he therefore treated Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un with\na consideration still more unusual, and readily strained all his\nresources to assist him.\n\nOn the very day on which the memorial was submitted to the Throne, he\nobtained by his efforts, a reinstatement to office, and before the\nexpiry of two months, Y\u00c3\u00bc-t'sun was forthwith selected to fill the\nappointment of prefect of Ying T'ien in Chin Ling. Taking leave of Chia\nCheng, he chose a propitious day, and proceeded to his post, where we\nwill leave him without further notice for the present.\n\nBut to return to Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc. On the day on which she left the boat, and the\nmoment she put her foot on shore, there were forthwith at her disposal\nchairs for her own use, and carts for the luggage, sent over from the\nJung mansion.\n\nLin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc had often heard her mother recount how different was her\ngrandmother's house from that of other people's; and having seen for\nherself how above the common run were already the attendants of the\nthree grades, (sent to wait upon her,) in attire, in their fare, in all\ntheir articles of use, \"how much more,\" (she thought to herself) \"now\nthat I am going to her home, must I be careful at every step, and\ncircumspect at every moment! Nor must I utter one word too many, nor\nmake one step more than is proper, for fear lest I should be ridiculed\nby any of them!\"\n\nFrom the moment she got into the chair, and they had entered within the\ncity walls, she found, as she looked around, through the gauze window,\nat the bustle in the streets and public places and at the immense\nconcourse of people, everything naturally so unlike what she had seen\nelsewhere.\n\nAfter they had also been a considerable time on the way, she suddenly\ncaught sight, at the northern end of the street, of two huge squatting\nlions of marble and of three lofty gates with (knockers representing)\nthe heads of animals. In front of these gates, sat, in a row, about ten\nmen in coloured hats and fine attire. The main gate was not open. It was\nonly through the side gates, on the east and west, that people went in\nand came out. Above the centre gate was a tablet. On this tablet were\ninscribed in five large characters--\"The Ning Kuo mansion erected by\nimperial command.\"\n\n\"This must be grandmother's eldest son's residence,\" reflected Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc.\n\nTowards the east, again, at no great distance, were three more high\ngateways, likewise of the same kind as those she had just seen. This was\nthe Jung Kuo mansion.\n\nThey did not however go in by the main gate; but simply made their\nentrance through the east side door.\n\nWith the sedans on their shoulders, (the bearers) proceeded about the\ndistance of the throw of an arrow, when upon turning a corner, they\nhastily put down the chairs. The matrons, who came behind, one and all\nalso dismounted. (The bearers) were changed for four youths of seventeen\nor eighteen, with hats and clothes without a blemish, and while they\ncarried the chair, the whole bevy of matrons followed on foot.\n\nWhen they reached a creeper-laden gate, the sedan was put down, and all\nthe youths stepped back and retired. The matrons came forward, raised\nthe screen, and supported Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc to descend from the chair.\n\nLin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc entered the door with the creepers, resting on the hand of a\nmatron.\n\nOn both sides was a verandah, like two outstretched arms. An Entrance\nHall stood in the centre, in the middle of which was a door-screen of Ta\nLi marble, set in an ebony frame. On the other side of this screen were\nthree very small halls. At the back of these came at once an extensive\ncourtyard, belonging to the main building.\n\nIn the front part were five parlours, the frieze of the ceiling of which\nwas all carved, and the pillars ornamented. On either side, were covered\navenues, resembling passages through a rock. In the side-rooms were\nsuspended cages, full of parrots of every colour, thrushes, and birds of\nevery description.\n\nOn the terrace-steps, sat several waiting maids, dressed in red and\ngreen, and the whole company of them advanced, with beaming faces, to\ngreet them, when they saw the party approach. \"Her venerable ladyship,\"\nthey said, \"was at this very moment thinking of you, miss, and, by a\nstrange coincidence, here you are.\"\n\nThree or four of them forthwith vied with each other in raising the door\ncurtain, while at the same time was heard some one announce: \"Miss Lin\nhas arrived.\"\n\nNo sooner had she entered the room, than she espied two servants\nsupporting a venerable lady, with silver-white hair, coming forward to\ngreet her. Convinced that this lady must be her grandmother, she was\nabout to prostrate herself and pay her obeisance, when she was quickly\nclasped in the arms of her grandmother, who held her close against her\nbosom; and as she called her \"my liver! my flesh!\" (my love! my\ndarling!) she began to sob aloud.\n\nThe bystanders too, at once, without one exception, melted into tears;\nand Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc herself found some difficulty in restraining her sobs. Little\nby little the whole party succeeded in consoling her, and Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc at\nlength paid her obeisance to her grandmother. Her ladyship thereupon\npointed them out one by one to Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc. \"This,\" she said, \"is the wife of\nyour uncle, your mother's elder brother; this is the wife of your uncle,\nher second brother; and this is your eldest sister-in-law Chu, the wife\nof your senior cousin Chu.\"\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc bowed to each one of them (with folded arms).\n\n\"Ask the young ladies in,\" dowager lady Chia went on to say; \"tell them\na guest from afar has just arrived, one who comes for the first time;\nand that they may not go to their lessons.\"\n\nThe servants with one voice signified their obedience, and two of them\nspeedily went to carry out her orders.\n\nNot long after three nurses and five or six waiting-maids were seen\nushering in three young ladies. The first was somewhat plump in figure\nand of medium height; her cheeks had a congealed appearance, like a\nfresh lichee; her nose was glossy like goose fat. She was gracious,\ndemure, and lovable to look at.\n\nThe second had sloping shoulders, and a slim waist. Tall and slender was\nshe in stature, with a face like the egg of a goose. Her eyes so\nbeautiful, with their well-curved eyebrows, possessed in their gaze a\nbewitching flash. At the very sight of her refined and elegant manners\nall idea of vulgarity was forgotten.\n\nThe third was below the medium size, and her mien was, as yet,\nchildlike.\n\nIn their head ornaments, jewelry, and dress, the get-up of the three\nyoung ladies was identical.\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc speedily rose to greet them and to exchange salutations. After\nthey had made each other's acquaintance, they all took a seat, whereupon\nthe servants brought the tea. Their conversation was confined to\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc's mother,--how she had fallen ill, what doctors had attended her,\nwhat medicines had been given her, and how she had been buried and\nmourned; and dowager lady Chia was naturally again in great anguish.\n\n\"Of all my daughters,\" she remarked, \"your mother was the one I loved\nbest, and now in a twinkle, she has passed away, before me too, and I've\nnot been able to so much as see her face. How can this not make my heart\nsore-stricken?\"\n\nAnd as she gave vent to these feelings, she took Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc's hand in hers,\nand again gave way to sobs; and it was only after the members of the\nfamily had quickly made use of much exhortation and coaxing, that they\nsucceeded, little by little, in stopping her tears.\n\nThey all perceived that Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, despite her youthful years and\nappearance, was lady-like in her deportment and address, and that though\nwith her delicate figure and countenance, (she seemed as if) unable to\nbear the very weight of her clothes, she possessed, however, a certain\ncaptivating air. And as they readily noticed the symptoms of a weak\nconstitution, they went on in consequence to make inquiries as to what\nmedicines she ordinarily took, and how it was that her complaint had not\nbeen cured.\n\n\"I have,\" explained Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"been in this state ever since I was born;\nthough I've taken medicines from the very time I was able to eat rice,\nup to the present, and have been treated by ever so many doctors of\nnote, I've not derived any benefit. In the year when I was yet only\nthree, I remember a mangy-headed bonze coming to our house, and saying\nthat he would take me along, and make a nun of me; but my father and\nmother would, on no account, give their consent. 'As you cannot bear to\npart from her and to give her up,' he then remarked, 'her ailment will,\nI fear, never, throughout her life, be cured. If you wish to see her all\nright, it is only to be done by not letting her, from this day forward,\non any account, listen to the sound of weeping, or see, with the\nexception of her parents, any relatives outside the family circle. Then\nalone will she be able to go through this existence in peace and in\nquiet.' No one heeded the nonsensical talk of this raving priest; but\nhere am I, up to this very day, dosing myself with ginseng pills as a\ntonic.\"\n\n\"What a lucky coincidence!\" interposed dowager lady Chia; \"some of these\npills are being compounded here, and I'll simply tell them to have an\nextra supply made; that's all.\"\n\nHardly had she finished these words, when a sound of laughter was heard\nfrom the back courtyard. \"Here I am too late!\" the voice said, \"and not\nin time to receive the distant visitor!\"\n\n\"Every one of all these people,\" reflected Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"holds her peace and\nsuppresses the very breath of her mouth; and who, I wonder, is this\ncoming in this reckless and rude manner?\"\n\nWhile, as yet, preoccupied with these thoughts, she caught sight of a\ncrowd of married women and waiting-maids enter from the back room,\npressing round a regular beauty.\n\nThe attire of this person bore no similarity to that of the young\nladies. In all her splendour and lustre, she looked like a fairy or a\ngoddess. In her coiffure, she had a band of gold filigree work,\nrepresenting the eight precious things, inlaid with pearls; and wore\npins, at the head of each of which were five phoenixes in a rampant\nposition, with pendants of pearls. On her neck, she had a reddish gold\nnecklet, like coiled dragons, with a fringe of tassels. On her person,\nshe wore a tight-sleeved jacket, of dark red flowered satin, covered\nwith hundreds of butterflies, embroidered in gold, interspersed with\nflowers. Over all, she had a variegated stiff-silk pelisse, lined with\nslate-blue ermine; while her nether garments consisted of a jupe of\nkingfisher-colour foreign crepe, brocaded with flowers.\n\nShe had a pair of eyes, triangular in shape like those of the red\nphoenix, two eyebrows, curved upwards at each temple, like willow\nleaves. Her stature was elegant; her figure graceful; her powdered face\nlike dawning spring, majestic, yet not haughty. Her carnation lips, long\nbefore they parted, betrayed a smile.\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc eagerly rose and greeted her.\n\nOld lady Chia then smiled. \"You don't know her,\" she observed. \"This is\na cunning vixen, who has made quite a name in this establishment! In\nNanking, she went by the appellation of vixen, and if you simply call\nher Feng Vixen, it will do.\"\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc was just at a loss how to address her, when all her cousins\ninformed Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, that this was her sister-in-law Lien.\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc had not, it is true, made her acquaintance before, but she had\nheard her mother mention that her eldest maternal uncle Chia She's son,\nChia Lien, had married the niece of Madame Wang, her second brother's\nwife, a girl who had, from her infancy, purposely been nurtured to\nsupply the place of a son, and to whom the school name of Wang Hsi-feng\nhad been given.\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc lost no time in returning her smile and saluting her with all\npropriety, addressing her as my sister-in-law. This Hsi-feng laid hold\nof Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc's hand, and minutely scrutinised her, for a while, from head\nto foot; after which she led her back next to dowager lady Chia, where\nthey both took a seat.\n\n\"If really there be a being of such beauty in the world,\" she\nconsequently observed with a smile, \"I may well consider as having set\neyes upon it to-day! Besides, in the air of her whole person, she\ndoesn't in fact look like your granddaughter-in-law, our worthy\nancestor, but in every way like your ladyship's own kindred-\ngranddaughter! It's no wonder then that your venerable ladyship\nshould have, day after day, had her unforgotten, even for a second, in\nyour lips and heart. It's a pity, however, that this cousin of mine\nshould have such a hard lot! How did it happen that our aunt died at\nsuch an early period?\"\n\nAs she uttered these words, she hastily took her handkerchief and wiped\nthe tears from her eyes.\n\n\"I've only just recovered from a fit of crying,\" dowager lady Chia\nobserved, as she smiled, \"and have you again come to start me? Your\ncousin has only now arrived from a distant journey, and she is so\ndelicate to boot! Besides, we have a few minutes back succeeded in\ncoaxing her to restrain her sobs, so drop at once making any allusion to\nyour former remarks!\"\n\nThis Hsi-feng, upon hearing these words, lost no time in converting her\nsorrow into joy.\n\n\"Quite right,\" she remarked. \"But at the sight of my cousin, my whole\nheart was absorbed in her, and I felt happy, and yet wounded at heart:\nbut having disregarded my venerable ancestor's presence, I deserve to be\nbeaten, I do indeed!\"\n\nAnd hastily taking once more Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc's hand in her own: \"How old are you,\ncousin?\" she inquired; \"Have you been to school? What medicines are you\ntaking? while you live here, you mustn't feel homesick; and if there's\nanything you would like to eat, or to play with, mind you come and tell\nme! or should the waiting maids or the matrons fail in their duties,\ndon't forget also to report them to me.\"\n\nAddressing at the same time the matrons, she went on to ask, \"Have Miss\nLin's luggage and effects been brought in? How many servants has she\nbrought along with her? Go, as soon as you can, and sweep two lower\nrooms and ask them to go and rest.\"\n\nAs she spake, tea and refreshments had already been served, and Hsi-feng\nherself handed round the cups and offered the fruits.\n\nUpon hearing the question further put by her maternal aunt Secunda,\n\"Whether the issue of the monthly allowances of money had been finished\nor not yet?\" Hsi-feng replied: \"The issue of the money has also been\ncompleted; but a few moments back, when I went along with several\nservants to the back upper-loft, in search of the satins, we looked for\never so long, but we saw nothing of the kind of satins alluded to by\nyou, madame, yesterday; so may it not be that your memory misgives you?\"\n\n\"Whether there be any or not, of that special kind, is of no\nconsequence,\" observed madame Wang. \"You should take out,\" she therefore\nwent on to add, \"any two pieces which first come under your hand, for\nthis cousin of yours to make herself dresses with; and in the evening,\nif I don't forget, I'll send some one to fetch them.\"\n\n\"I've in fact already made every provision,\" rejoined Hsi-feng; \"knowing\nvery well that my cousin would be arriving within these two days, I have\nhad everything got ready for her. And when you, madame, go back, if you\nwill pass an eye over everything, I shall be able to send them round.\"\n\nMadame Wang gave a smile, nodded her head assentingly, but uttered not a\nword by way of reply.\n\nThe tea and fruit had by this time been cleared, and dowager lady Chia\ndirected two old nurses to take Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc to go and see her two maternal\nuncles; whereupon Chia She's wife, madame Hsing, hastily stood up and\nwith a smiling face suggested, \"I'll take my niece over; for it will\nafter all be considerably better if I go!\"\n\n\"Quite so!\" answered dowager lady Chia, smiling; \"you can go home too,\nand there will be no need for you to come over again!\"\n\nMadame Hsing expressed her assent, and forthwith led Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc to take\nleave of madame Wang. The whole party escorted them as far as the door\nof the Entrance Hall, hung with creepers, where several youths had drawn\na carriage, painted light blue, with a kingfisher-coloured hood.\n\nMadame Hsing led Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc by the hand and they got up into their seats.\nThe whole company of matrons put the curtain down, and then bade the\nyouths raise the carriage; who dragged it along, until they came to an\nopen space, where they at length put the mules into harness.\n\nGoing out again by the eastern side gate, they proceeded in an easterly\ndirection, passed the main entrance of the Jung mansion, and entered a\nlofty doorway painted black. On the arrival in front of the ceremonial\ngate, they at once dismounted from the curricle, and madame Hsing,\nhand-in-hand with Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, walked into the court.\n\n\"These grounds,\" surmised Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc to herself, \"must have been originally\nconverted from a piece partitioned from the garden of the Jung mansion.\"\n\nHaving entered three rows of ceremonial gates they actually caught sight\nof the main structure, with its vestibules and porches, all of which,\nthough on a small scale, were full of artistic and unique beauty. They\nwere nothing like the lofty, imposing, massive and luxurious style of\narchitecture on the other side, yet the avenues and rockeries, in the\nvarious places in the court, were all in perfect taste.\n\nWhen they reached the interior of the principal pavilion, a large\nconcourse of handmaids and waiting maids, got up in gala dress, were\nalready there to greet them. Madame Hsing pressed Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc into a seat,\nwhile she bade some one go into the outer library and request Mr. Chia\nShe to come over.\n\nIn a few minutes the servant returned. \"Master,\" she explained, \"says:\n'that he has not felt quite well for several days, that as the meeting\nwith Miss Lin will affect both her as well as himself, he does not for\nthe present feel equal to seeing each other, that he advises Miss Lin\nnot to feel despondent or homesick; that she ought to feel quite at home\nwith her venerable ladyship, (her grandmother,) as well as her maternal\naunts; that her cousins are, it is true, blunt, but that if all the\nyoung ladies associated together in one place, they may also perchance\ndispel some dulness; that if ever (Miss Lin) has any grievance, she\nshould at once speak out, and on no account feel a stranger; and\neverything will then be right.\"\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc lost no time in respectfully standing up, resuming her seat after\nshe had listened to every sentence of the message to her. After a while,\nshe said goodbye, and though madame Hsing used every argument to induce\nher to stay for the repast and then leave, Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc smiled and said, \"I\nshouldn't under ordinary circumstances refuse the invitation to dinner,\nwhich you, aunt, in your love kindly extend to me, but I have still to\ncross over and pay my respects to my maternal uncle Secundus; if I went\ntoo late, it would, I fear, be a lack of respect on my part; but I shall\naccept on another occasion. I hope therefore that you will, dear aunt,\nkindly excuse me.\"\n\n\"If such be the case,\" madame Hsing replied, \"it's all right.\" And\npresently directing two nurses to take her niece over, in the carriage,\nin which they had come a while back, Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc thereupon took her leave;\nmadame Hsing escorting her as far as the ceremonial gate, where she gave\nsome further directions to all the company of servants. She followed the\ncurricle with her eyes so long as it remained in sight, and at length\nretraced her footsteps.\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc shortly entered the Jung Mansion, descended from the carriage,\nand preceded by all the nurses, she at once proceeded towards the east,\nturned a corner, passed through an Entrance Hall, running east and west,\nand walked in a southern direction, at the back of the Large Hall. On\nthe inner side of a ceremonial gate, and at the upper end of a spacious\ncourt, stood a large main building, with five apartments, flanked on\nboth sides by out-houses (stretching out) like the antlers on the head\nof deer; side-gates, resembling passages through a hill, establishing a\nthorough communication all round; (a main building) lofty, majestic,\nsolid and grand, and unlike those in the compound of dowager lady Chia.\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc readily concluded that this at last was the main inner suite of\napartments. A raised broad road led in a straight line to the large\ngate. Upon entering the Hall, and raising her head, she first of all\nperceived before her a large tablet with blue ground, upon which figured\nnine dragons of reddish gold. The inscription on this tablet consisted\nof three characters as large as a peck-measure, and declared that this\nwas the Hall of Glorious Felicity.\n\nAt the end, was a row of characters of minute size, denoting the year,\nmonth and day, upon which His Majesty had been pleased to confer the\ntablet upon Chia Yuan, Duke of Jung Kuo. Besides this tablet, were\nnumberless costly articles bearing the autograph of the Emperor. On the\nlarge black ebony table, engraved with dragons, were placed three\nantique blue and green bronze tripods, about three feet in height. On\nthe wall hung a large picture representing black dragons, such as were\nseen in waiting chambers of the Sui dynasty. On one side stood a gold\ncup of chased work, while on the other, a crystal casket. On the ground\nwere placed, in two rows, sixteen chairs, made of hard-grained cedar.\n\nThere was also a pair of scrolls consisting of black-wood antithetical\ntablets, inlaid with the strokes of words in chased gold. Their burden\nwas this:\n\n  On the platform shine resplendent pearls like sun or moon,\n  And the sheen of the Hall fa\u00c3\u00a7ade gleams like russet sky.\n\nBelow, was a row of small characters, denoting that the scroll had been\nwritten by the hand of Mu Shih, a fellow-countryman and old friend of\nthe family, who, for his meritorious services, had the hereditary title\nof Prince of Tung Ngan conferred upon him.\n\nThe fact is that madame Wang was also not in the habit of sitting and\nresting, in this main apartment, but in three side-rooms on the east, so\nthat the nurses at once led Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc through the door of the eastern wing.\n\nOn a stove-couch, near the window, was spread a foreign red carpet. On\nthe side of honour, were laid deep red reclining-cushions, with dragons,\nwith gold cash (for scales), and an oblong brown-coloured\nsitting-cushion with gold-cash-spotted dragons. On the two sides, stood\none of a pair of small teapoys of foreign lacquer of peach-blossom\npattern. On the teapoy on the left, were spread out Wen Wang tripods,\nspoons, chopsticks and scent-bottles. On the teapoy on the right, were\nvases from the Ju Kiln, painted with girls of great beauty, in which\nwere placed seasonable flowers; (on it were) also teacups, a tea service\nand the like articles.\n\nOn the floor on the west side of the room, were four chairs in a row,\nall of which were covered with antimacassars, embroidered with\nsilverish-red flowers, while below, at the feet of these chairs, stood\nfour footstools. On either side, was also one of a pair of high teapoys,\nand these teapoys were covered with teacups and flower vases.\n\nThe other nick-nacks need not be minutely described.\n\nThe old nurses pressed Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc to sit down on the stove-couch; but, on\nperceiving near the edge of the couch two embroidered cushions, placed\none opposite the other, she thought of the gradation of seats, and did\nnot therefore place herself on the couch, but on a chair on the eastern\nside of the room; whereupon the waiting maids, in attendance in these\nquarters, hastened to serve the tea.\n\nWhile Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc was sipping her tea, she observed the headgear, dress,\ndeportment and manners of the several waiting maids, which she really\nfound so unlike what she had seen in other households. She had hardly\nfinished her tea, when she noticed a waiting maid approach, dressed in a\nred satin jacket, and a waistcoat of blue satin with scollops.\n\n\"My lady requests Miss Lin to come over and sit with her,\" she remarked\nas she put on a smile.\n\nThe old nurses, upon hearing this message, speedily ushered Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc again\nout of this apartment, into the three-roomed small main building by the\neastern porch.\n\nOn the stove-couch, situated at the principal part of the room, was\nplaced, in a transverse position, a low couch-table, at the upper end of\nwhich were laid out, in a heap, books and a tea service. Against the\npartition-wall, on the east side, facing the west, was a reclining\npillow, made of blue satin, neither old nor new.\n\nMadame Wang, however, occupied the lower seat, on the west side, on\nwhich was likewise placed a rather shabby blue satin sitting-rug, with a\nback-cushion; and upon perceiving Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc come in she urged her at once\nto sit on the east side.\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc concluded, in her mind, that this seat must certainly belong to\nChia Cheng, and espying, next to the couch, a row of three chairs,\ncovered with antimacassars, strewn with embroidered flowers, somewhat\nalso the worse for use, Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc sat down on one of these chairs.\n\nBut as madame Wang pressed her again and again to sit on the couch,\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc had at length to take a seat next to her.\n\n\"Your uncle,\" madame Wang explained, \"is gone to observe this day as a\nfast day, but you'll see him by and bye. There's, however, one thing I\nwant to talk to you about. Your three female cousins are all, it is\ntrue, everything that is nice; and you will, when later on you come\ntogether for study, or to learn how to do needlework, or whenever, at\nany time, you romp and laugh together, find them all most obliging; but\nthere's one thing that causes me very much concern. I have here one, who\nis the very root of retribution, the incarnation of all mischief, one\nwho is a ne'er-do-well, a prince of malignant spirits in this family. He\nis gone to-day to pay his vows in the temple, and is not back yet, but\nyou will see him in the evening, when you will readily be able to judge\nfor yourself. One thing you must do, and that is, from this time forth,\nnot to pay any notice to him. All these cousins of yours don't venture\nto bring any taint upon themselves by provoking him.\"\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc had in days gone by heard her mother explain that she had a\nnephew, born into the world, holding a piece of jade in his mouth, who\nwas perverse beyond measure, who took no pleasure in his books, and\nwhose sole great delight was to play the giddy dog in the inner\napartments; that her maternal grandmother, on the other hand, loved him\nso fondly that no one ever presumed to call him to account, so that\nwhen, in this instance, she heard madame Wang's advice, she at once felt\ncertain that it must be this very cousin.\n\n\"Isn't it to the cousin born with jade in his mouth, that you are\nalluding to, aunt?\" she inquired as she returned her smile. \"When I was\nat home, I remember my mother telling me more than once of this very\ncousin, who (she said) was a year older than I, and whose infant name\nwas Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. She added that his disposition was really wayward, but that\nhe treats all his cousins with the utmost consideration. Besides, now\nthat I have come here, I shall, of course, be always together with my\nfemale cousins, while the boys will have their own court, and separate\nquarters; and how ever will there be any cause of bringing any slur upon\nmyself by provoking him?\"\n\n\"You don't know the reasons (that prompt me to warn you),\" replied\nmadame Wang laughingly. \"He is so unlike all the rest, all because he\nhas, since his youth up, been doated upon by our old lady! The fact is\nthat he has been spoilt, through over-indulgence, by being always in the\ncompany of his female cousins! If his female cousins pay no heed to him,\nhe is, at any rate, somewhat orderly, but the day his cousins say one\nword more to him than usual, much trouble forthwith arises, at the\noutburst of delight in his heart. That's why I enjoin upon you not to\nheed him. From his mouth, at one time, issue sugared words and\nmellifluous phrases; and at another, like the heavens devoid of the sun,\nhe becomes a raving fool; so whatever you do, don't believe all he\nsays.\"\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc was assenting to every bit of advice as it was uttered, when\nunexpectedly she beheld a waiting-maid walk in. \"Her venerable ladyship\nover there,\" she said, \"has sent word about the evening meal.\"\n\nMadame Wang hastily took Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc by the hand, and emerging by the door of\nthe back-room, they went eastwards by the verandah at the back. Past the\nside gate, was a roadway, running north and south. On the southern side\nwere a pavilion with three divisions and a Reception Hall with a\ncolonnade. On the north, stood a large screen wall, painted white;\nbehind it was a very small building, with a door of half the ordinary\nsize.\n\n\"These are your cousin Feng's rooms,\" explained madame Wang to Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc,\nas she pointed to them smiling. \"You'll know in future your way to come\nand find her; and if you ever lack anything, mind you mention it to her,\nand she'll make it all right.\"\n\nAt the door of this court, were also several youths, who had recently\nhad the tufts of their hair tied together, who all dropped their hands\nagainst their sides, and stood in a respectful posture. Madame Wang then\nled Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc by the hand through a corridor, running east and west, into\nwhat was dowager lady Chia's back-court. Forthwith they entered the door\nof the back suite of rooms, where stood, already in attendance, a large\nnumber of servants, who, when they saw madame Wang arrive, set to work\nsetting the tables and chairs in order.\n\nChia Chu's wife, n\u00c3\u00a9e Li, served the eatables, while Hsi-feng placed the\nchopsticks, and madame Wang brought the soup in. Dowager lady Chia was\nseated all alone on the divan, in the main part of the apartment, on the\ntwo sides of which stood four vacant chairs.\n\nHsi-feng at once drew Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, meaning to make her sit in the foremost\nchair on the left side, but Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc steadily and concedingly declined.\n\n\"Your aunts and sisters-in-law, standing on the right and left,\" dowager\nlady Chia smilingly explained, \"won't have their repast in here, and as\nyou're a guest, it's but proper that you should take that seat.\"\n\nThen alone it was that Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc asked for permission to sit down, seating\nherself on the chair.\n\nMadame Wang likewise took a seat at old lady Chia's instance; and the\nthree cousins, Ying Ch'un and the others, having craved for leave to sit\ndown, at length came forward, and Ying Ch'un took the first chair on the\nright, T'an Ch'un the second, and Hsi Ch'un the second on the left.\nWaiting maids stood by holding in their hands, flips and finger-bowls\nand napkins, while Mrs. Li and lady Feng, the two of them, kept near the\ntable advising them what to eat, and pressing them to help themselves.\n\nIn the outer apartments, the married women and waiting-maids in\nattendance, were, it is true, very numerous; but not even so much as the\nsound of the cawing of a crow could be heard.\n\nThe repast over, each one was presented by a waiting-maid, with tea in a\nsmall tea tray; but the Lin family had all along impressed upon the mind\nof their daughter that in order to show due regard to happiness, and to\npreserve good health, it was essential, after every meal, to wait a\nwhile, before drinking any tea, so that it should not do any harm to the\nintestines. When, therefore, Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc perceived how many habits there were\nin this establishment unlike those which prevailed in her home, she too\nhad no alternative but to conform herself to a certain extent with them.\nUpon taking over the cup of tea, servants came once more and presented\nfinger-bowls for them to rinse their mouths, and Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc also rinsed\nhers; and after they had all again finished washing their hands, tea was\neventually served a second time, and this was, at length, the tea that\nwas intended to be drunk.\n\n\"You can all go,\" observed dowager lady Chia, \"and let us alone to have\na chat.\"\n\nMadame Wang rose as soon as she heard these words, and having made a few\nirrelevant remarks, she led the way and left the room along with the two\nladies, Mrs. Li and lady Feng.\n\nDowager lady Chia, having inquired of Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc what books she was reading,\n\"I have just begun reading the Four Books,\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc replied. \"What books\nare my cousins reading?\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc went on to ask.\n\n\"Books, you say!\" exclaimed dowager lady Chia; \"why all they know are a\nfew characters, that's all.\"\n\nThe sentence was barely out of her lips, when a continuous sounding of\nfootsteps was heard outside, and a waiting maid entered and announced\nthat Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was coming. Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc was speculating in her mind how it was\nthat this Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had turned out such a good-for-nothing fellow, when he\nhappened to walk in.\n\nHe was, in fact, a young man of tender years, wearing on his head, to\nhold his hair together, a cap of gold of purplish tinge, inlaid with\nprecious gems. Parallel with his eyebrows was attached a circlet,\nembroidered with gold, and representing two dragons snatching a pearl.\nHe wore an archery-sleeved deep red jacket, with hundreds of butterflies\nworked in gold of two different shades, interspersed with flowers; and\nwas girded with a sash of variegated silk, with clusters of designs, to\nwhich was attached long tassels; a kind of sash worn in the palace. Over\nall, he had a slate-blue fringed coat of Japanese brocaded satin, with\neight bunches of flowers in relief; and wore a pair of light blue satin\nwhite-soled, half-dress court-shoes.\n\nHis face was like the full moon at mid-autumn; his complexion, like\nmorning flowers in spring; the hair along his temples, as if chiselled\nwith a knife; his eyebrows, as if pencilled with ink; his nose like a\nsuspended gallbladder (a well-cut and shapely nose); his eyes like\nvernal waves; his angry look even resembled a smile; his glance, even\nwhen stern, was full of sentiment.\n\nRound his neck he had a gold dragon necklet with a fringe; also a cord\nof variegated silk, to which was attached a piece of beautiful jade.\n\nAs soon as Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc became conscious of his presence, she was quite taken\naback. \"How very strange!\" she was reflecting in her mind; \"it would\nseem as if I had seen him somewhere or other, for his face appears\nextremely familiar to my eyes;\" when she noticed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc face dowager\nlady Chia and make his obeisance. \"Go and see your mother and then come\nback,\" remarked her venerable ladyship; and at once he turned round and\nquitted the room.\n\nOn his return, he had already changed his hat and suit. All round his\nhead, he had a fringe of short hair, plaited into small queues, and\nbound with red silk. The queues were gathered up at the crown, and all\nthe hair, which had been allowed to grow since his birth, was plaited\ninto a thick queue, which looked as black and as glossy as lacquer.\nBetween the crown of the head and the extremity of the queue, hung a\nstring of four large pearls, with pendants of gold, representing the\neight precious things. On his person, he wore a long silvery-red coat,\nmore or less old, bestrewn with embroidery of flowers. He had still\nround his neck the necklet, precious gem, amulet of Recorded Name,\nphilacteries, and other ornaments. Below were partly visible a fir-cone\ncoloured brocaded silk pair of trousers, socks spotted with black\ndesigns, with ornamented edges, and a pair of deep red, thick-soled\nshoes.\n\n(Got up as he was now,) his face displayed a still whiter appearance, as\nif painted, and his eyes as if they were set off with carnation. As he\nrolled his eyes, they brimmed with love. When he gave utterance to\nspeech, he seemed to smile. But the chief natural pleasing feature was\nmainly centred in the curve of his eyebrows. The ten thousand and one\nfond sentiments, fostered by him during the whole of his existence, were\nall amassed in the corner of his eyes.\n\nHis outward appearance may have been pleasing to the highest degree, but\nyet it was no easy matter to fathom what lay beneath it.\n\nThere are a couple of roundelays, composed by a later poet, (after the\nexcellent rhythm of the) Hsi Chiang Yueh, which depict Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc in a most\nadequate manner.\n\nThe roundelays run as follows:\n\n  To gloom and passion prone, without a rhyme,\n  Inane and madlike was he many a time,\n  His outer self, forsooth, fine may have been,\n  But one wild, howling waste his mind within:\n  Addled his brain that nothing he could see;\n  A dunce! to read essays so loth to be!\n  Perverse in bearing, in temper wayward;\n  For human censure he had no regard.\n  When rich, wealth to enjoy he knew not how;\n  When poor, to poverty he could not bow.\n  Alas! what utter waste of lustrous grace!\n  To state, to family what a disgrace!\n  Of ne'er-do-wells below he was the prime,\n  Unfilial like him none up to this time.\n  Ye lads, pampered with sumptuous fare and dress,\n  Beware! In this youth's footsteps do not press!\n\nBut to proceed with our story.\n\n\"You have gone and changed your clothes,\" observed dowager lady Chia,\n\"before being introduced to the distant guest. Why don't you yet salute\nyour cousin?\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc had long ago become aware of the presence of a most beautiful\nyoung lady, who, he readily concluded, must be no other than the\ndaughter of his aunt Lin. He hastened to advance up to her, and make his\nbow; and after their introduction, he resumed his seat, whence he\nminutely scrutinised her features, (which he thought) so unlike those of\nall other girls.\n\nHer two arched eyebrows, thick as clustered smoke, bore a certain not\nvery pronounced frowning wrinkle. She had a pair of eyes, which\npossessed a cheerful, and yet one would say, a sad expression,\noverflowing with sentiment. Her face showed the prints of sorrow stamped\non her two dimpled cheeks. She was beautiful, but her whole frame was\nthe prey of a hereditary disease. The tears in her eyes glistened like\nsmall specks. Her balmy breath was so gentle. She was as demure as a\nlovely flower reflected in the water. Her gait resembled a frail willow,\nagitated by the wind. Her heart, compared with that of Pi Kan, had one\nmore aperture of intelligence; while her ailment exceeded (in intensity)\nby three degrees the ailment of Hsi-Tzu.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, having concluded his scrutiny of her, put on a smile and said,\n\"This cousin I have already seen in days gone by.\"\n\n\"There you are again with your nonsense,\" exclaimed lady Chia,\nsneeringly; \"how could you have seen her before?\"\n\n\"Though I may not have seen her, ere this,\" observed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc with a\nsmirk, \"yet when I look at her face, it seems so familiar, and to my\nmind, it would appear as if we had been old acquaintances; just as if,\nin fact, we were now meeting after a long separation.\"\n\n\"That will do! that will do!\" remarked dowager lady Chia; \"such being\nthe case, you will be the more intimate.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, thereupon, went up to Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, and taking a seat next to her,\ncontinued to look at her again with all intentness for a good long\nwhile.\n\n\"Have you read any books, cousin?\" he asked.\n\n\"I haven't as yet,\" replied Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"read any books, as I have only been\nto school for a year; all I know are simply a few characters.\"\n\n\"What is your worthy name, cousin?\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc went on to ask; whereupon\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc speedily told him her name.\n\n\"Your style?\" inquired Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc; to which question Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc replied, \"I have\nno style.\"\n\n\"I'll give you a style,\" suggested Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc smilingly; \"won't the double\nstyle 'P'in P'in,' 'knitting brows,' do very well?\"\n\n\"From what part of the standard books does that come?\" T'an Ch'un\nhastily interposed.\n\n\"It is stated in the Thorough Research into the state of Creation from\nremote ages to the present day,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc went on to explain, \"that, in\nthe western quarter, there exists a stone, called Tai, (black,) which\ncan be used, in lieu of ink, to blacken the eyebrows with. Besides the\neyebrows of this cousin taper in a way, as if they were contracted, so\nthat the selection of these two characters is most appropriate, isn't\nit?\"\n\n\"This is just another plagiarism, I fear,\" observed T'an Ch'un, with an\nironic smirk.\n\n\"Exclusive of the Four Books,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc remarked smilingly, \"the majority\nof works are plagiarised; and is it only I, perchance, who plagiarise?\nHave you got any jade or not?\" he went on to inquire, addressing Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc,\n(to the discomfiture) of all who could not make out what he meant.\n\n\"It's because he has a jade himself,\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc forthwith reasoned within\nher mind, \"that he asks me whether I have one or not.--No; I haven't\none,\" she replied. \"That jade of yours is besides a rare object, and how\ncould every one have one?\"\n\nAs soon as Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc heard this remark, he at once burst out in a fit of\nhis raving complaint, and unclasping the gem, he dashed it disdainfully\non the floor. \"Rare object, indeed!\" he shouted, as he heaped invective\non it; \"it has no idea how to discriminate the excellent from the mean,\namong human beings; and do tell me, has it any perception or not? I too\ncan do without this rubbish!\"\n\nAll those, who stood below, were startled; and in a body they pressed\nforward, vying with each other as to who should pick up the gem.\n\nDowager lady Chia was so distressed that she clasped Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc in her\nembrace. \"You child of wrath,\" she exclaimed. \"When you get into a\npassion, it's easy enough for you to beat and abuse people; but what\nmakes you fling away that stem of life?\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc's face was covered with the traces of tears. \"All my cousins\nhere, senior as well as junior,\" he rejoined, as he sobbed, \"have no\ngem, and if it's only I to have one, there's no fun in it, I maintain!\nand now comes this angelic sort of cousin, and she too has none, so that\nit's clear enough that it is no profitable thing.\"\n\nDowager lady Chia hastened to coax him. \"This cousin of yours,\" she\nexplained, \"would, under former circumstances, have come here with a\njade; and it's because your aunt felt unable, as she lay on her\ndeath-bed, to reconcile herself to the separation from your cousin, that\nin the absence of any remedy, she forthwith took the gem belonging to\nher (daughter), along with her (in the grave); so that, in the first\nplace, by the fulfilment of the rites of burying the living with the\ndead might be accomplished the filial piety of your cousin; and in the\nsecond place, that the spirit of your aunt might also, for the time\nbeing, use it to gratify the wish of gazing on your cousin. That's why\nshe simply told you that she had no jade; for she couldn't very well\nhave had any desire to give vent to self-praise. Now, how can you ever\ncompare yourself with her? and don't you yet carefully and circumspectly\nput it on? Mind, your mother may come to know what you have done!\"\n\nAs she uttered these words, she speedily took the jade over from the\nhand of the waiting-maid, and she herself fastened it on for him.\n\nWhen Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc heard this explanation, he indulged in reflection, but could\nnot even then advance any further arguments.\n\nA nurse came at the moment and inquired about Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc's quarters, and\ndowager lady Chia at once added, \"Shift Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc along with me, into the\nwarm room of my suite of apartments, and put your mistress, Miss Lin,\ntemporarily in the green gauze house; and when the rest of the winter is\nover, and repairs are taken in hand in spring in their rooms, an\nadditional wing can be put up for her to take up her quarters in.\"\n\n\"My dear ancestor,\" ventured Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc; \"the bed I occupy outside the green\ngauze house is very comfortable; and what need is there again for me to\nleave it and come and disturb your old ladyship's peace and quiet?\"\n\n\"Well, all right,\" observed dowager lady Chia, after some consideration;\n\"but let each one of you have a nurse, as well as a waiting-maid to\nattend on you; the other servants can remain in the outside rooms and\nkeep night watch and be ready to answer any call.\"\n\nAt an early hour, besides, Hsi-feng had sent a servant round with a grey\nflowered curtain, embroidered coverlets and satin quilts and other such\narticles.\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc had brought along with her only two servants; the one was her own\nnurse, dame Wang, and the other was a young waiting-maid of sixteen,\nwhose name was called Hs\u00c3\u00bceh Yen. Dowager lady Chia, perceiving that\nHs\u00c3\u00bceh Yen was too youthful and quite a child in her manner, while nurse\nWang was, on the other hand, too aged, conjectured that Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc would, in\nall her wants, not have things as she liked, so she detached two\nwaiting-maids, who were her own personal attendants, named Tzu Ch\u00c3\u00bcan and\nYing Ko, and attached them to Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc's service. Just as had Ying Ch'un\nand the other girls, each one of whom had besides the wet nurses of\ntheir youth, four other nurses to advise and direct them, and exclusive\nof two personal maids to look after their dress and toilette, four or\nfive additional young maids to do the washing and sweeping of the rooms\nand the running about backwards and forwards on errands.\n\nNurse Wang, Tzu Ch\u00c3\u00bcan and other girls entered at once upon their\nattendance on Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc in the green gauze rooms, while Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's wet-nurse,\ndame Li, together with an elderly waiting-maid, called Hsi Jen, were on\nduty in the room with the large bed.\n\nThis Hsi Jen had also been, originally, one of dowager lady Chia's\nservant-girls. Her name was in days gone by, Chen Chu. As her venerable\nladyship, in her tender love for Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, had feared that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's\nservant girls were not equal to their duties, she readily handed her to\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, as she had hitherto had experience of how sincere and\nconsiderate she was at heart.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, knowing that her surname was at one time Hua, and having once\nseen in some verses of an ancient poet, the line \"the fragrance of\nflowers wafts itself into man,\" lost no time in explaining the fact to\ndowager lady Chia, who at once changed her name into Hsi Jen.\n\nThis Hsi Jen had several simple traits. While in attendance upon dowager\nlady Chia, in her heart and her eyes there was no one but her venerable\nladyship, and her alone; and now in her attendance upon Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, her\nheart and her eyes were again full of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, and him alone. But as\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc was of a perverse temperament and did not heed her repeated\ninjunctions, she felt at heart exceedingly grieved.\n\nAt night, after nurse Li had fallen asleep, seeing that in the inner\nchambers, Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, Ying Ko and the others had not as yet retired to rest,\nshe disrobed herself, and with gentle step walked in.\n\n\"How is it, miss,\" she inquired smiling, \"that you have not turned in as\nyet?\"\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc at once put on a smile. \"Sit down, sister,\" she rejoined,\npressing her to take a seat. Hsi Jen sat on the edge of the bed.\n\n\"Miss Lin,\" interposed Ying Ko smirkingly, \"has been here in an awful\nstate of mind! She has cried so to herself, that her eyes were flooded,\nas soon as she dried her tears. 'It's only to-day that I've come,' she\nsaid, 'and I've already been the cause of the outbreak of your young\nmaster's failing. Now had he broken that jade, as he hurled it on the\nground, wouldn't it have been my fault? Hence it was that she was so\nwounded at heart, that I had all the trouble in the world, before I\ncould appease her.\"\n\n\"Desist at once, Miss! Don't go on like this,\" Hsi Jen advised her;\n\"there will, I fear, in the future, happen things far more strange and\nridiculous than this; and if you allow yourself to be wounded and\naffected to such a degree by a conduct such as his, you will, I\napprehend, suffer endless wounds and anguish; so be quick and dispel\nthis over-sensitive nature!\"\n\n\"What you sisters advise me,\" replied Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"I shall bear in mind, and\nit will be all right.\"\n\nThey had another chat, which lasted for some time, before they at length\nretired to rest for the night.\n\nThe next day, (she and her cousins) got up at an early hour and went\nover to pay their respects to dowager lady Chia, after which upon coming\nto madame Wang's apartments, they happened to find madame Wang and\nHsi-feng together, opening the letters which had arrived from Chin Ling.\nThere were also in the room two married women, who had been sent from\nmadame Wang's elder brother's wife's house to deliver a message.\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc was, it is true, not aware of what was up, but T'an Ch'un and the\nothers knew that they were discussing the son of her mother's sister,\nmarried in the Hs\u00c3\u00bceh family, in the city of Chin Ling, a cousin of\ntheirs, Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an, who relying upon his wealth and influence had, by\nassaulting a man, committed homicide, and who was now to be tried in the\ncourt of the Ying T'ien Prefecture.\n\nHer maternal uncle, Wang Tzu-t'eng, had now, on the receipt of the\ntidings, despatched messengers to bring over the news to the Chia\nfamily. But the next chapter will explain what was the ultimate issue of\nthe wish entertained in this mansion to send for the Hs\u00c3\u00bceh family to\ncome to the capital.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n  An ill-fated girl happens to meet an ill-fated young man.\n  The Hu Lu Bonze adjudicates the Hu Lu case.\n\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc, for we shall now return to our story, having come, along with\nher cousin to madame Wang's apartments, found madame Wang discussing\ncertain domestic occurrences with the messengers, who had arrived from\nher elder brother's wife's home, and conversing also about the case of\nhomicide, in which the family of her mother's sister had become\ninvolved, and other such relevant topics. Perceiving how pressing and\nperplexing were the matters in which madame Wang was engaged, the young\nladies promptly left her apartments, and came over to the rooms of their\nwidow sister-in-law, Mrs. Li.\n\nThis Mrs. Li had originally been the spouse of Chia Chu. Although Chu\nhad died at an early age, he had the good fortune of leaving behind him\na son, to whom the name of Chia Lan was given. He was, at this period,\njust in his fifth year, and had already entered school, and applied\nhimself to books.\n\nThis Mrs. Li was also the daughter of an official of note in Chin Ling.\nHer father's name was Li Shou-chung, who had, at one time, been Imperial\nLibationer. Among his kindred, men as well as women had all devoted\nthemselves to poetry and letters; but ever since Li Shou-chung continued\nthe line of succession, he readily asserted that the absence of literary\nattainments in his daughter was indeed a virtue, so that it soon came\nabout that she did not apply herself in real earnest to learning; with\nthe result that all she studied were some parts of the \"Four Books for\nwomen,\" and the \"Memoirs of excellent women,\" that all she read did not\nextend beyond a limited number of characters, and that all she committed\nto memory were the examples of these few worthy female characters of\ndynasties of yore; while she attached special importance to spinning and\nfemale handiwork. To this reason is to be assigned the name selected for\nher, of Li Wan (Li, the weaver), and the style of Kung Ts'ai (Palace\nSempstress).\n\nHence it was that, though this Li Wan still continued, after the loss of\nher mate, while she was as yet in the spring of her life, to live amidst\naffluence and luxury, she nevertheless resembled in every respect a\nblock of rotten wood or dead ashes. She had no inclination whatsoever to\ninquire after anything or to listen to anything; while her sole and\nexclusive thought was to wait upon her relatives and educate her son;\nand, in addition to this, to teach her young sisters-in-law to do\nneedlework and to read aloud.\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc was, it is true, at this period living as a guest in the Chia\nmansion, where she certainly had the several young ladies to associate\nwith her, but, outside her aged father, (she thought) there was really\nno need for her to extend affection to any of the rest.\n\nBut we will now speak of Chia Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un. Having obtained the appointment\nof Prefect of Ying T'ien, he had no sooner arrived at his post than a\ncharge of manslaughter was laid before his court. This had arisen from\nsome rivalry between two parties in the purchase of a slave-girl, either\nof whom would not yield his right; with the result that a serious\nassault occurred, which ended in homicide.\n\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un had, with all promptitude, the servants of the plaintiffs\nbrought before him, and subjected them to an examination.\n\n\"The victim of the assault,\" the plaintiffs deposed, \"was your servants'\nmaster. Having on a certain day, purchased a servant-girl, she\nunexpectedly turned out to be a girl who had been carried away and sold\nby a kidnapper. This kidnapper had, first of all, got hold of our\nfamily's money, and our master had given out that he would on the third\nday, which was a propitious day, take her over into the house, but\nthis kidnapper stealthily sold her over again to the Hs\u00c3\u00bceh family. When\nwe came to know of this, we went in search of the seller to lay hold of\nhim, and bring back the girl by force. But the Hs\u00c3\u00bceh party has been all\nalong _the_ bully of Chin Ling, full of confidence in his wealth,\nfull of presumption on account of his prestige; and his arrogant menials\nin a body seized our master and beat him to death. The murderous master\nand his crew have all long ago made good their escape, leaving no trace\nbehind them, while there only remain several parties not concerned in\nthe affair. Your servants have for a whole year lodged complaints, but\nthere has been no one to do our cause justice, and we therefore implore\nyour Lordship to have the bloodstained criminals arrested, and thus\nconduce to the maintenance of humanity and benevolence; and the living,\nas well as the dead, will feel boundless gratitude for this heavenly\nbounty.\"\n\nWhen Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un heard their appeal, he flew into a fiery rage. \"What!\" he\nexclaimed. \"How could a case of such gravity have taken place as the\nmurder of a man, and the culprits have been allowed to run away\nscot-free, without being arrested? Issue warrants, and despatch\nconstables to at once lay hold of the relatives of the bloodstained\ncriminals and bring them to be examined by means of torture.\"\n\nThereupon he espied a Retainer, who was standing by the judgment-table,\nwink at him, signifying that he should not issue the warrants. Y\u00c3\u00bc-t'sun\ngave way to secret suspicion, and felt compelled to desist.\n\nWithdrawing from the Court-room, he retired into a private chamber, from\nwhence he dismissed his followers, only keeping this single Retainer to\nwait upon him.\n\nThe Retainer speedily advanced and paid his obeisance. \"Your worship,\"\nhe said smiling, \"has persistently been rising in official honours, and\nincreasing in wealth so that, in the course of about eight or nine\nyears, you have forgotten me.\"\n\n\"Your face is, however, extremely familiar,\" observed Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un, \"but I\ncannot, for the moment, recall who you are.\"\n\n\"Honourable people forget many things,\" remarked the Retainer, as he\nsmiled. \"What! Have you even forgotten the place where you started in\nlife? and do you not remember what occurred, in years gone by, in the Hu\nLu Temple?\"\n\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un was filled with extreme astonishment; and past events then\nbegan to dawn upon him.\n\nThe fact is that this Retainer had been at one time a young priest in\nthe Hu Lu temple; but as, after its destruction by fire, he had no place\nto rest his frame, he remembered how light and easy was, after all, this\nkind of occupation, and being unable to reconcile himself to the\nsolitude and quiet of a temple, he accordingly availed himself of his\nyears, which were as yet few, to let his hair grow, and become a\nretainer.\n\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un had had no idea that it was he. Hastily taking his hand in his,\nhe smilingly observed, \"You are, indeed, an old acquaintance!\" and then\npressed him to take a seat, so as to have a chat with more ease, but the\nRetainer would not presume to sit down.\n\n\"Friendships,\" Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un remarked, putting on a smiling expression,\n\"contracted in poor circumstances should not be forgotten! This is a\nprivate room; so that if you sat down, what would it matter?\"\n\nThe Retainer thereupon craved permission to take a seat, and sat down\ngingerly, all awry.\n\n\"Why did you, a short while back,\" Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un inquired, \"not allow me to\nissue the warrants?\"\n\n\"Your illustrious office,\" replied the Retainer, \"has brought your\nworship here, and is it likely you have not transcribed some philactery\nof your post in this province!\"\n\n\"What is an office-philactery?\" asked Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un with alacrity.\n\n\"Now-a-days,\" explained the Retainer, \"those who become local officers\nprovide themselves invariably with a secret list, in which are entered\nthe names and surnames of the most influential and affluent gentry of\nnote in the province. This is in vogue in every province. Should\ninadvertently, at any moment, one give umbrage to persons of this\nstatus, why, not only office, but I fear even one's life, it would be\ndifficult to preserve. That's why these lists are called\noffice-philacteries. This Hs\u00c3\u00bceh family, just a while back spoken of, how\ncould your worship presume to provoke? This case in question affords no\ndifficulties whatever in the way of a settlement; but the prefects, who\nhave held office before you, have all, by doing violence to the feelings\nand good name of these people, come to the end they did.\"\n\nAs he uttered these words, he produced, from inside a purse which he had\nhandy, a transcribed office-philactery, which he handed over to\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un; who upon perusal, found it full of trite and unpolished\nexpressions of public opinion, with regard to the leading clans and\nnotable official families in that particular district. They ran as\nfollows:\n\nThe \"Chia\" family is not \"chia,\" a myth; white jade form the Halls; gold\ncompose their horses! The \"A Fang\" Palace is three hundred li in extent,\nbut is no fit residence for a \"Shih\" of Chin Ling. The eastern seas lack\nwhite jade beds, and the \"Lung Wang,\" king of the Dragons, has come to\nask for one of the Chin Ling Wang, (Mr. Wang of Chin Ling.) In a\nplenteous year, snow, (Hs\u00c3\u00bceh,) is very plentiful; their pearls and gems\nare like sand, their gold like iron.\n\nScarcely had Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un done reading, when suddenly was heard the\nannouncement, communicated by the beating of a gong, that Mr. Wang had\ncome to pay his respects.\n\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un hastily adjusted his official clothes and hat, and went out of\nthe room to greet and receive the visitor. Returning after a short while\nhe proceeded to question the Retainer (about what he had been perusing.)\n\n\"These four families,\" explained the Retainer, \"are all interlaced by\nties of relationship, so that if you offend one, you offend all; if you\nhonour one, you honour all. For support and protection, they all have\nthose to take care of their interests! Now this Hs\u00c3\u00bceh, who is charged\nwith homicide, is indeed the Hs\u00c3\u00bceh implied by 'in a plenteous year,\n(Hs\u00c3\u00bceh,) snow, is very plentiful.' In fact, not only has he these three\nfamilies to rely upon, but his (father's) old friends, and his own\nrelatives and friends are both to be found in the capital, as well as\nabroad in the provinces; and they are, what is more, not few in number.\nWho is it then that your Worship purposes having arrested?\"\n\nWhen Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un had heard these remarks, he forthwith put on a smile and\ninquired of the Retainer, \"If what you say be true, how is then this\nlawsuit to be settled? Are you also perchance well aware of the place of\nretreat of this homicide?\"\n\n\"I don't deceive your Worship,\" the Retainer ventured smiling, \"when I\nsay that not only do I know the hiding-place of this homicide, but that\nI also am acquainted with the man who kidnapped and sold the girl; I\nlikewise knew full well the poor devil and buyer, now deceased. But\nwait, and I'll tell your worship all, with full details. This person,\nwho succumbed to the assault, was the son of a minor gentry. His name\nwas Feng Y\u00c3\u00bcan. His father and mother are both deceased, and he has\nlikewise no brothers. He looked after some scanty property in order to\neke out a living. His age was eighteen or nineteen; and he had a strong\npenchant for men's, and not much for women's society. But this was too\nthe retribution (for sins committed) in a previous existence! for\ncoming, by a strange coincidence, in the way of this kidnapper, who was\nselling the maid, he straightway at a glance fell in love with this\ngirl, and made up his mind to purchase her and make her his second wife;\nentering an oath not to associate with any male friends, nor even to\nmarry another girl. And so much in earnest was he in this matter that he\nhad to wait until after the third day before she could enter his\nhousehold (so as to make the necessary preparations for the marriage).\nBut who would have foreseen the issue? This kidnapper quietly disposed\nof her again by sale to the Hs\u00c3\u00bceh family; his intention being to pocket\nthe price-money from both parties, and effect his escape. Contrary to\nhis calculations, he couldn't after all run away in time, and the two\nbuyers laid hold of him and beat him, till he was half dead; but neither\nof them would take his coin back, each insisting upon the possession of\nthe girl. But do you think that young gentleman, Mr. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh, would yield\nhis claim to her person? Why, he at once summoned his servants and bade\nthem have recourse to force; and, taking this young man Feng, they\nassailed him till they made mincemeat of him. He was then carried back\nto his home, where he finally died after the expiry of three days. This\nyoung Mr. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh had previously chosen a day, on which he meant to set\nout for the capital, and though he had beaten the young man Feng to\ndeath, and carried off the girl, he nevertheless behaved in the manner\nof a man who had had no concern in the affair. And all he gave his mind\nto was to take his family and go along on his way; but not in any wise\nin order to evade (the consequences) of this (occurrence). This case of\nhomicide, (he looked upon) as a most trivial and insignificant matter,\nwhich, (he thought), his brother and servants, who were on the spot,\nwould be enough to settle. But, however, enough of this person. Now does\nyour worship know who this girl is who was sold?\"\n\n\"How could I possibly know?\" answered Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un.\n\n\"And yet,\" remarked the Retainer, as he laughed coldly, \"this is a\nperson to whom you are indebted for great obligations; for she is no one\nelse than the daughter of Mr. Chen, who lived next door to the Hu Lu\ntemple. Her infant name is 'Ying Lien.'\"\n\n\"What! is it really she?\" exclaimed Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un full of surprise. \"I heard\nthat she had been kidnapped, ever since she was five years old; but has\nshe only been sold recently?\"\n\n\"Kidnappers of this kind,\" continued the Retainer, \"only abduct infant\ngirls, whom they bring up till they reach the age of twelve or thirteen,\nwhen they take them into strange districts and dispose of them through\ntheir agents. In days gone by, we used daily to coax this girl, Ying\nLien, to romp with us, so that we got to be exceedingly friendly. Hence\nit is that though, with the lapse of seven or eight years, her mien has\nassumed a more surpassingly lovely appearance, her general features\nhave, on the other hand, undergone no change; and this is why I can\nrecognise her. Besides, in the centre of her two eyebrows, she had a\nspot, of the size of a grain of rice, of carnation colour, which she has\nhad ever since she was born into the world. This kidnapper, it also\nhappened, rented my house to live in; and on a certain day, on which the\nkidnapper was not at home, I even set her a few questions. She said,\n'that the kidnapper had so beaten her, that she felt intimidated, and\ncouldn't on any account, venture to speak out; simply averring that the\nkidnapper was her own father, and that, as he had no funds to repay his\ndebts, he had consequently disposed of her by sale!' I tried time after\ntime to induce her to answer me, but she again gave way to tears and\nadded no more than: 'I don't really remember anything of my youth.' Of\nthis, anyhow, there can be no doubt; on a certain day the young man Feng\nand the kidnapper met, said the money was paid down; but as the\nkidnapper happened to be intoxicated, Ying Lien exclaimed, as she\nsighed: 'My punishment has this day been consummated!' Later on again,\nwhen she heard that young Feng would, after three days, have her taken\nover to his house, she once more underwent a change and put on such a\nsorrowful look that, unable to brook the sight of it, I waited till the\nkidnapper went out, when I again told my wife to go and cheer her by\nrepresenting to her that this Mr. Feng's fixed purpose to wait for a\npropitious day, on which to come and take her over, was ample proof that\nhe would not look upon her as a servant-girl. 'Furthermore,' (explained\nmy wife to her), 'he is a sort of person exceedingly given to fast\nhabits, and has at home ample means to live upon, so that if, besides,\nwith his extreme aversion to women, he actually purchases you now, at a\nfancy price, you should be able to guess the issue, without any\nexplanation. You have to bear suspense only for two or three days, and\nwhat need is there to be sorrowful and dejected?' After these\nassurances, she became somewhat composed, flattering herself that she\nwould from henceforth have a home of her own.\n\n\"But who would believe that the world is but full of disappointments! On\nthe succeeding day, it came about that the kidnapper again sold her to\nthe Hs\u00c3\u00bceh family! Had he disposed of her to any other party, no harm\nwould anyhow have resulted; but this young gentleman Hs\u00c3\u00bceh, who is\nnicknamed by all, 'the Foolish and overbearing Prince,' is the most\nperverse and passionate being in the whole world. What is more, he\nthrows money away as if it were dust. The day on which he gave the\nthrashing with blows like falling leaves and flowing water, he dragged\n(_lit_. pull alive, drag dead) Ying Lien away more dead than alive,\nby sheer force, and no one, even up to this date, is aware whether she\nbe among the dead or the living. This young Feng had a spell of empty\nhappiness; for (not only) was his wish not fulfilled, but on the\ncontrary he spent money and lost his life; and was not this a lamentable\ncase?\"\n\nWhen Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un heard this account he also heaved a sigh. \"This was\nindeed,\" he observed, \"a retribution in store for them! Their encounter\nwas likewise not accidental; for had it been, how was it that this Feng\nY\u00c3\u00bcan took a fancy to Ying Lien?\n\n\"This Ying Lien had, during all these years, to endure much harsh\ntreatment from the hands of the kidnapper, and had, at length, obtained\nthe means of escape; and being besides full of warm feeling, had he\nactually made her his wife, and had they come together, the event would\ncertainly have been happy; but, as luck would have it, there occurred\nagain this contretemps.\n\n\"This Hs\u00c3\u00bceh is, it is true, more laden with riches and honours than Feng\nwas, but when we bear in mind what kind of man he is he certainly, with\nhis large bevy of handmaids, and his licentious and inordinate habits,\ncannot ever be held equal to Feng Y\u00c3\u00bcan, who had set his heart upon one\nperson! This may appositely be termed a fantastic sentimental destiny,\nwhich, by a strange coincidence, befell a couple consisting of an\nill-fated young fellow and girl! But why discuss third parties? The only\nthing now is how to decide this case, so as to put things right.\"\n\n\"Your worship,\" remarked the Retainer smiling, \"displayed, in years gone\nby, such great intelligence and decision, and how is it that today you,\non the contrary, become a person without any resources! Your servant has\nheard that the promotion of your worship to fill up this office is due\nto the exertions of the Chia and Wang families; and as this Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an\nis a relative of the Chia mansion, why doesn't your worship take your\ncraft along with the stream, and bring, by the performance of a\nkindness, this case to an issue, so that you may again in days to come,\nbe able to go and face the two Dukes Chia and Wang?\"\n\n\"What you suggest,\" replied Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un, \"is, of course, right enough; but\nthis case involves a human life, and honoured as I have been, by His\nMajesty the Emperor, by a restoration to office, and selection to an\nappointment, how can I at the very moment, when I may strain all my\nenergies to show my gratitude, by reason of a private consideration, set\nthe laws at nought? This is a thing which I really haven't the courage\nto do.\"\n\n\"What your worship says is naturally right and proper,\" remarked the\nRetainer at these words, smiling sarcastically, \"but at the present\nstage of the world, such things cannot be done. Haven't you heard the\nsaying of a man of old to the effect that great men take action suitable\nto the times. 'He who presses,' he adds, 'towards what is auspicious and\navoids what is inauspicious is a perfect man.' From what your worship\nsays, not only you couldn't, by any display of zeal, repay your\nobligation to His Majesty, but, what is more, your own life you will\nfind it difficult to preserve. There are still three more considerations\nnecessary to insure a safe settlement.\"\n\nY\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un drooped his head for a considerable time.\n\n\"What is there in your idea to be done?\" he at length inquired.\n\n\"Your servant,\" responded the Retainer, \"has already devised a most\nexcellent plan. It's this: To-morrow, when your Lordship sits in court,\nyou should, merely for form's sake, make much ado, by despatching\nletters and issuing warrants for the arrest of the culprits. The\nmurderer will naturally not be forthcoming; and as the plaintiffs will\nbe strong in their displeasure, you will of course have some members of\nthe clan of the Hs\u00c3\u00bceh family, together with a few servants and others,\ntaken into custody, and examined under torture, when your servant will\nbe behind the scenes to bring matters to a settlement, by bidding them\nreport that the victim had succumbed to a sudden ailment, and by urging\nthe whole number of the kindred, as well as the headmen of the place, to\nhand in a declaration to that effect. Your Worship can aver that you\nunderstand perfectly how to write charms in dust, and conjure the\nspirit; having had an altar, covered with dust, placed in the court, you\nshould bid the military and people to come and look on to their heart's\ncontent. Your Worship can give out that the divining spirit has\ndeclared: 'that the deceased, Feng Y\u00c3\u00bcan, and Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an had been enemies\nin a former life, that having now met in the narrow road, their\ndestinies were consummated; that Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an has, by this time,\ncontracted some indescribable disease and perished from the effects of\nthe persecution of the spirit of Feng.' That as the calamity had\noriginated entirely from the action of the kidnapper, exclusive of\ndealing with the kidnapper according to law, the rest need not be\ninterfered with, and so on. Your servant will be in the background to\nspeak to the kidnapper and urge him to make a full confession; and when\npeople find that the response of the divining spirit harmonizes with the\nstatements of the kidnapper, they will, as a matter of course, entertain\nno suspicion.\n\n\"The Hs\u00c3\u00bceh family have plenty of money, so that if your Worship\nadjudicates that they should pay five hundred, they can afford it, or\none thousand will also be within their means; and this sum can be handed\nto the Feng family to meet the outlay of burning incense and burial\nexpenses. The Feng family are, besides, people of not much consequence,\nand (the fuss made by them) being simply for money, they too will, when\nthey have got the cash in hand, have nothing more to say. But may it\nplease your worship to consider carefully this plan and see what you\nthink of it?\"\n\n\"It isn't a safe course! It isn't a safe course!\" Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un observed as\nhe smiled. \"Let me further think and deliberate; and possibly by\nsucceeding in suppressing public criticism, the matter might also be\nsettled.\"\n\nThese two closed their consultation by a fixed determination, and the\nnext day, when he sat in judgment, he marked off a whole company of the\nplaintiffs as well as of the accused, as were mentioned by name, and had\nthem brought before him. Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un examined them with additional\nminuteness, and discovered in point of fact, that the inmates of the\nFeng family were extremely few, that they merely relied upon this charge\nwith the idea of obtaining some compensation for joss-sticks and\nburials; and that the Hs\u00c3\u00bceh family, presuming on their prestige and\nconfident of patronage, had been obstinate in the refusal to make any\nmutual concession, with the result that confusion had supervened, and\nthat no decision had been arrived at.\n\nFollowing readily the bent of his feelings, Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un disregarded the\nlaws, and adjudicated this suit in a random way; and as the Feng family\ncame in for a considerable sum, with which to meet the expense for\nincense and the funeral, they had, after all, not very much to say (in\nthe way of objections.)\n\nWith all despatch, Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un wrote and forwarded two letters, one to Chia\nCheng, and the other to Wang Tzu-t'eng, at that time commander-in-chief\nof a Metropolitan Division, simply informing them: that the case, in\nwhich their worthy nephew was concerned, had come to a close, and that\nthere was no need for them to give way to any extreme solicitude.\n\nThis case had been settled through the exclusive action of the young\npriest of the Hu Lu temple, now an official Retainer; and Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un,\napprehending, on the other hand, lest he might in the presence of\nothers, divulge the circumstances connected with the days gone by, when\nhe was in a state of penury, naturally felt very unhappy in his mind.\nBut at a later period, he succeeded, by ultimately finding in him some\nshortcoming, and deporting him to a far-away place, in setting his fears\nat rest.\n\nBut we will put Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un on one side, and refer to the young man Hs\u00c3\u00bceh,\nwho purchased Ying Lien, and assaulted Feng Yuan to death.\n\nHe too was a native of Chin Ling and belonged to a family literary\nduring successive generations; but this young Hs\u00c3\u00bceh had recently, when\nof tender age, lost his father, and his widowed mother out of pity for\nhis being the only male issue and a fatherless child, could not help\ndoating on him and indulging him to such a degree, that when he, in\ncourse of time, grew up to years of manhood, he was good for nothing.\n\nIn their home, furthermore, was the wealth of a millionaire, and they\nwere, at this time, in receipt of an income from His Majesty's privy\npurse, for the purvey of various articles.\n\nThis young Hs\u00c3\u00bceh went at school under the name of P'an. His style was\nWen Ch'i. His natural habits were extravagant; his language haughty and\nsupercilious. He had, of course, also been to school, but all he knew\nwas a limited number of characters, and those not well. The whole day\nlong, his sole delight was in cock-fighting and horse-racing, rambling\nover hills and doing the sights.\n\nThough a Purveyor, by Imperial appointment, he had not the least idea of\nanything relating to matters of business or of the world. All he was\ngood for was: to take advantage of the friendships enjoyed by his\ngrandfather in days of old, to present himself at the Board of Revenue\nto perfunctorily sign his name and to draw the allowance and rations;\nwhile the rest of his affairs he, needless to say, left his partners and\nold servants of the family to manage for him.\n\nHis widowed mother, a Miss Wang, was the youngest sister of Wang\nTzu-t'eng, whose present office was that of Commander-in-Chief of a\nMetropolitan Division; and was, with Madame Wang, the spouse of Chia\nCheng, of the Jung Kuo Mansion, sisters born of one mother. She was, in\nthis year, more or less forty years of age and had only one son: this\nHs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an.\n\nShe also had a daughter, who was two years younger than Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an, and\nwhose infant name was Pao Ch'ai. She was beautiful in appearance, and\nelegant and refined in deportment. In days gone by, when her father\nlived, he was extremely fond of this girl, and had her read books and\nstudy characters, so that, as compared with her brother, she was\nactually a hundred times his superior. Having become aware, ever since\nher father's death, that her brother could not appease the anguish of\nher mother's heart, she at once dispelled all thoughts of books, and\ngave her sole mind to needlework, to the menage and other such concerns,\nso as to be able to participate in her mother's sorrow, and to bear the\nfatigue in lieu of her.\n\nAs of late the Emperor on the Throne held learning and propriety in high\nesteem, His Majesty called together and singled out talent and ability,\nupon which he deigned to display exceptional grace and favour. Besides\nthe number called forth from private life and chosen as Imperial\nsecondary wives, the daughters of families of hereditary official status\nand renown were without exception, reported by name to the authorities,\nand communicated to the Board, in anticipation of the selection for\nmaids in waiting to the Imperial Princesses and daughters of Imperial\nPrinces in their studies, and for filling up the offices of persons of\neminence, to urge them to become excellent.\n\nEver since the death of Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an's father, the various assistants,\nmanagers and partners, and other employes in the respective provinces,\nperceiving how youthful Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an was in years, and how much he lacked\nworldly experience, readily availed themselves of the time to begin\nswindling and defrauding. The business, carried on in various different\nplaces in the capital, gradually also began to fall off and to show a\ndeficit.\n\nHs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an had all along heard that the capital was the _one_ place\nfor gaieties, and was just entertaining the idea of going on a visit,\nwhen he eagerly jumped at the opportunity (that presented itself,) first\nof all to escort his sister, who was going to wait for the selection, in\nthe second place to see his relatives, and in the third to enter\npersonally the capital, (professedly) to settle up long-standing\naccounts, and to make arrangements for new outlays, but, in reality,\nwith the sole purpose of seeing the life and splendour of the\nmetropolis.\n\nHe therefore, had, at an early period, got ready his baggage and small\nluggage, as well as the presents for relatives and friends, things of\nevery description of local production, presents in acknowledgment of\nfavours received, and other such effects, and he was about to choose a\nday to start on his journey when unexpectedly he came in the way of the\nkidnapper who offered Ying Lien for sale. As soon as Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an saw how\n_distingu\u00c3\u00a9e_ Ying Lien was in her appearance, he formed the\nresolution of buying her; and when he encountered Feng Y\u00c3\u00bcan, come with\nthe object of depriving him of her, he in the assurance of superiority,\ncalled his sturdy menials together, who set upon Feng Y\u00c3\u00bcan and beat him\nto death. Forthwith collecting all the affairs of the household, and\nentrusting them one by one to the charge of some members of the clan and\nseveral elderly servants of the family, he promptly took his mother,\nsister and others and after all started on his distant journey, while\nthe charge of homicide he, however, treated as child's play, flattering\nhimself that if he spent a few filthy pieces of money, there was no\ndoubt as to its settlement.\n\nHe had been on his journey how many days, he had not reckoned, when, on\na certain day, as they were about to enter the capital, he furthermore\nheard that his maternal uncle, Wang Tzu-t'eng, had been raised to the\nrank of Supreme Governor of nine provinces, and had been honoured with\nan Imperial command to leave the capital and inspect the frontiers.\n\nHs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an was at heart secretly elated. \"I was just lamenting,\" he\nthought, \"that on my visit to the capital, I would have my maternal\nuncle to exercise control over me, and that I wouldn't be able to gambol\nand frisk to my heart's content, but now that he is leaving the capital,\non promotion, it's evident that Heaven accomplishes man's wishes.\"\n\nAs he consequently held consultation with his mother; \"Though we have,\"\nhe argued, \"several houses of our own in the capital, yet for these last\nten years or so, there has been no one to live in them, and the people\ncharged with the looking after them must unavoidably have stealthily\nrented them to some one or other. It's therefore needful to let servants\ngo ahead to sweep and get the place in proper order, before we can very\nwell go ourselves.\"\n\n\"What need is there to go to such trouble?\" retorted his mother; \"the\nmain object of our present visit to the capital is first of all to pay\nour respects to our relatives and friends; and it is, either at your\nelder uncle's, my brother's place, or at your other uncle's, my sister's\nhusband's home, both of which families' houses are extremely spacious,\nthat we can put up provisionally, and by and bye, at our ease, we can\nsend servants to make our house tidy. Now won't this be a considerable\nsaving of trouble?\"\n\n\"My uncle, your brother,\" suggested Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an, \"has just been raised to\nan appointment in an outside province, so that, of course, in his house,\nthings must be topsy-turvey, on account of his departure; and should we\nbetake ourselves, like a hive of bees and a long trail, to him for\nshelter; won't we appear very inconsiderate?\"\n\n\"Your uncle,\" remarked his mother, \"is, it is true, going on promotion,\nbut there's besides the house of your aunt, my sister. What is more,\nduring these last few years from both your uncle's and aunt's have, time\nafter time, been sent messages, and letters forwarded, asking us to come\nover; and now that we've come, is it likely, though your uncle is busy\nwith his preparations to start on his journey, that your aunt of the\nChia family won't do all she can to press us to stay? Besides, were we\nto have our house got ready in a scramble, won't it make people think it\nstrange? I however know your idea very well that were we kept to stay at\nyour uncle's and aunt's, you won't escape being under strict restraint,\nunlike what would be the case were we to live in our own house, as you\nwould be free then to act as you please! Such being the case, go, on\nyour own account, and choose some place to take up your quarters in,\nwhile I myself, who have been separated from your aunt and cousins for\nthese several years, would however like to stay with them for a few\ndays; and I'll go along with your sister and look up your aunt at her\nhome. What do you say; will this suit you or not?\"\n\nHs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an, upon hearing his mother speak in this strain, knew well\nenough that he could not bring her round from her determination; and he\nhad no help but to issue the necessary directions to the servants to\nmake straight for the Jung Kuo mansion. Madame Wang had by this time\nalready come to know that in the lawsuit, in which Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an was\nconcerned, Chia Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un had fortunately intervened and lent his good\noffices, and was at length more composed in her mind. But when she again\nsaw that her eldest brother had been advanced to a post on the frontier,\nshe was just deploring that, deprived of the intercourse of the\nrelatives of her mother's family, how doubly lonely she would feel;\nwhen, after the lapse of a few days, some one of the household brought\nthe unexpected announcement that \"our lady, your sister, has, with the\nyoung gentleman, the young lady and her whole household, entered the\ncapital and have dismounted from their vehicles outside the main\nentrance.\" This news so delighted madame Wang that she rushed out, with\na few attendants, to greet them in the large Entrance Hall, and brought\nMrs. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh and the others into her house.\n\nThe two sisters were now reunited, at an advanced period of their lives,\nso that mixed feelings of sorrow and joy thronged together, but on these\nit is, of course, needless to dilate.\n\nAfter conversing for a time on what had occurred, subsequent to their\nseparation, madame Wang took them to pay their obeisance to dowager lady\nChia. They then handed over the various kinds of presents and indigenous\narticles, and after the whole family had been introduced, a banquet was\nalso spread to greet the guests.\n\nHs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an, having paid his respects to Chia Cheng and Chia Lien, was\nlikewise taken to see Chia She, Chia Chen and the other members.\n\nChia Cheng sent a messenger to tell madame Wang that \"'aunt' Hs\u00c3\u00bceh had\nalready seen many springs and autumns, while their nephew was of tender\nage, with no experience, so that there was every fear, were he to live\noutside, that something would again take place. In the South-east corner\nof our compound,\" (he sent word,) \"there are in the Pear Fragrance\nCourt, over ten apartments, all of which are vacant and lying idle; and\nwere we to tell the servants to sweep them, and invite 'aunt' Hs\u00c3\u00bceh and\nthe young gentleman and lady to take up their quarters there, it would\nbe an extremely wise thing.\"\n\nMadame Wang had in fact been entertaining the wish to keep them to live\nwith them, when dowager lady Chia also sent some one to say that, \"Mrs.\nHs\u00c3\u00bceh should be asked to put up in the mansion in order that a greater\nfriendliness should exist between them all.\"\n\nMrs. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh herself had all along been desirous to live in one place with\nher relatives, so as to be able to keep a certain check over her son,\nfearing that, if they lived in a separate house outside, the natural\nbent of his habits would run riot, and that some calamity would be\nbrought on; and she therefore, there and then, expressed her sense of\nappreciation, and accepted the invitation. She further privately told\nmadame Wang in clear terms, that every kind of daily expense and general\ncontribution would have to be entirely avoided and withdrawn as that\nwould be the only thing to justify her to make any protracted stay. And\nmadame Wang aware that she had, in her home, no difficulty in this line,\npromptly in fact complied with her wishes.\n\nFrom this date it was that \"aunt\" Hs\u00c3\u00bceh and her children took up their\nquarters in the Pear Fragrance Court.\n\nThis Court of Pear Fragrance had, we must explain, been at one time used\nas a place for the quiet retirement of the Duke Jung in his advanced\nyears. It was on a small scale, but ingeniously laid out. There were, at\nleast, over ten structures. The front halls and the back houses were all\nin perfect style. There was a separate door giving on to the street, and\nthe people of the household of Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an used this door to go in and\nout. At the south-west quarter, there was also a side door, which\ncommunicated with a narrow roadway. Beyond this narrow road, was the\neastern court of madame Wang's principal apartment; so that every day,\neither after her repast, or in the evening, Mrs. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh would readily\ncome over and converse, on one thing and another, with dowager lady\nChia, or have a chat with madame Wang; while Pao-ch'ai came together,\nday after day, with Tai y\u00c3\u00bc, Ying-ch'un, her sisters and the other girls,\neither to read, to play chess, or to do needlework, and the pleasure\nwhich they derived was indeed perfect.\n\nHs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an however had all along from the first instance, been loth to\nlive in the Chia mansion, as he dreaded that with the discipline\nenforced by his uncle, he would not be able to be his own master; but\nhis mother had made up her mind so positively to remain there, and what\nwas more, every one in the Chia mansion was most pressing in their\nefforts to keep them, that there was no alternative for him but to take\nup his quarters temporarily there, while he at the same time directed\nservants to go and sweep the apartments of their own house, with a view\nthat they should move into them when they were ready.\n\nBut, contrary to expectation, after they had been in their quarters for\nnot over a month, Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an came to be on intimate relations with all\nthe young men among the kindred of the Chia mansion, the half of whom\nwere extravagant in their habits, so that great was, of course, his\ndelight to frequent them. To-day, they would come together to drink\nwine; the next day to look at flowers. They even assembled to gamble, to\ndissipate and to go everywhere and anywhere; leading, with all their\nenticements, Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an so far astray, that he became far worse, by a\nhundred times, than he was hitherto.\n\nAlthough it must be conceded that Chia Cheng was in the education of his\nchildren quite correct, and in the control of his family quite\nsystematic, yet in the first place, the clan was so large and the\nmembers so numerous, that he was unable to attend to the entire\nsupervision; and, in the second place, the head of the family, at this\nperiod, was Chia Chen, who, as the eldest grandchild of the Ning\nmansion, had likewise now come into the inheritance of the official\nstatus, with the result that all matters connected with the clan\ndevolved upon his sole and exclusive control. In the third place, public\nas well as private concerns were manifold and complex, and being a man\nof negligent disposition, he estimated ordinary affairs of so little\nconsequence that any respite from his official duties he devoted to no\nmore than the study of books and the playing of chess.\n\nFurthermore, this Pear Fragrance Court was separated by two rows of\nbuildings from his quarters and was also provided with a separate door\nopening into the street, so that, being able at their own heart's desire\nto go out and to come in, these several young fellows could well indulge\ntheir caprices, and gratify the bent of their minds.\n\nHence it was that Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an, in course of time gradually extinguished\nfrom his memory every idea of shifting their quarters.\n\nBut what transpired, on subsequent days, the following chapter will\nexplain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n  The spirit of Chia Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc visits the confines of the Great Void.\n  The Monitory Vision Fairy expounds, in ballads, the Dream of the Red\n      Chamber.\n\n\nHaving in the fourth Chapter explained, to some degree, the\ncircumstances attending the settlement of the mother and children of the\nHs\u00c3\u00bceh family in the Jung mansion, and other incidental matters, we will\nnow revert to Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc.\n\nEver since her arrival in the Jung mansion, dowager lady Chia showed her\nthe highest sympathy and affection, so that in everything connected with\nsleeping, eating, rising and accommodation she was on the same footing\nas Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc; with the result that Ying Ch'un, Hsi Ch'un and T'an Ch'un,\nher three granddaughters, had after all to take a back seat. In fact,\nthe intimate and close friendliness and love which sprung up between the\ntwo persons Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc and Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, was, in the same degree, of an\nexceptional kind, as compared with those existing between the others. By\ndaylight they were wont to walk together, and to sit together. At night,\nthey would desist together, and rest together. Really it was a case of\nharmony in language and concord in ideas, of the consistency of varnish\nor of glue, (a close friendship), when at this unexpected juncture there\ncame this girl, Hs\u00c3\u00bceh Pao-ch'ai, who, though not very much older in\nyears (than the others), was, nevertheless, in manner so correct, and in\nfeatures so beautiful that the consensus of opinion was that Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc\nherself could not come up to her standard.\n\nWhat is more, in her ways Pao-Ch'ai was so full of good tact, so\nconsiderate and accommodating, so unlike Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, who was supercilious,\nself-confident, and without any regard for the world below, that the\nnatural consequence was that she soon completely won the hearts of the\nlower classes. Even the whole number of waiting-maids would also for the\nmost part, play and joke with Pao-ch'ai. Hence it was that Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc\nfostered, in her heart, considerable feelings of resentment, but of this\nhowever Pao-ch'ai had not the least inkling.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc was, likewise, in the prime of his boyhood, and was, besides, as\nfar as the bent of his natural disposition was concerned, in every\nrespect absurd and perverse; regarding his cousins, whether male or\nfemale, one and all with one common sentiment, and without any\ndistinction whatever between the degrees of distant or close\nrelationship. Sitting and sleeping, as he now was under the same roof\nwith Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc in dowager lady Chia's suite of rooms, he naturally became\ncomparatively more friendly with her than with his other cousins; and\nthis friendliness led to greater intimacy and this intimacy once\nestablished, rendered unavoidable the occurrence of the blight of\nharmony from unforeseen slight pretexts.\n\nThese two had had on this very day, for some unknown reason, words\nbetween them more or less unfriendly, and Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc was again sitting all\nalone in her room, giving way to tears. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was once more within\nhimself quite conscience-smitten for his ungraceful remarks, and coming\nforward, he humbly made advances, until, at length, Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc little by\nlittle came round.\n\nAs the plum blossom, in the eastern part of the garden of the Ning\nmansion, was in full bloom, Chia Chen's spouse, Mrs. Yu, made\npreparations for a collation, (purposing) to send invitations to dowager\nlady Chia, mesdames Hsing, and Wang, and the other members of the\nfamily, to come and admire the flowers; and when the day arrived the\nfirst thing she did was to take Chia Jung and his wife, the two of them,\nand come and ask them round in person. Dowager lady Chia and the other\ninmates crossed over after their early meal; and they at once promenaded\nthe Hui Fang (Concentrated Fragrance) Garden. First tea was served, and\nnext wine; but the entertainment was no more than a family banquet of\nthe kindred of the two mansions of Ning and Jung, so that there was a\ntotal lack of any novel or original recreation that could be put on\nrecord.\n\nAfter a little time, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc felt tired and languid and inclined for his\nmidday siesta. \"Take good care,\" dowager lady Chia enjoined some of\nthem, \"and stay with him, while he rests for a while, when he can come\nback;\" whereupon Chia Jung's wife, Mrs. Ch'in, smiled and said with\neagerness: \"We got ready in here a room for uncle Pao, so let your\nvenerable ladyship set your mind at ease. Just hand him over to my\ncharge, and he will be quite safe. Mothers and sisters,\" she continued,\naddressing herself to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's nurses and waiting maids, \"invite uncle\nPao to follow me in here.\"\n\nDowager lady Chia had always been aware of the fact that Mrs. Ch'in was\na most trustworthy person, naturally courteous and scrupulous, and in\nevery action likewise so benign and gentle; indeed the most estimable\namong the whole number of her great grandsons' wives, so that when she\nsaw her about to go and attend to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, she felt that, for a\ncertainty, everything would be well.\n\nMrs. Ch'in, there and then, led away a company of attendants, and came\ninto the rooms inside the drawing room. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, upon raising his head,\nand catching sight of a picture hung on the upper wall, representing a\nhuman figure, in perfect style, the subject of which was a portrait of\nYen Li, speedily felt his heart sink within him.\n\nThere was also a pair of scrolls, the text of which was:\n\n  A thorough insight into worldly matters arises from knowledge;\n  A clear perception of human nature emanates from literary lore.\n\nOn perusal of these two sentences, albeit the room was sumptuous and\nbeautifully laid out, he would on no account remain in it. \"Let us go at\nonce,\" he hastened to observe, \"let us go at once.\"\n\nMrs. Ch'in upon hearing his objections smiled. \"If this,\" she said, \"is\nreally not nice, where are you going? if you won't remain here, well\nthen come into my room.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc nodded his head and gave a faint grin.\n\n\"Where do you find the propriety,\" a nurse thereupon interposed, \"of an\nuncle going to sleep in the room of a nephew's wife?\"\n\n\"Ai ya!\" exclaimed Mrs. Ch'in laughing, \"I don't mind whether he gets\nangry or not (at what I say); but how old can he be as to reverentially\nshun all these things? Why my brother was with me here last month;\ndidn't you see him? he's, true enough, of the same age as uncle Pao, but\nwere the two of them to stand side by side, I suspect that he would be\nmuch higher in stature.\"\n\n\"How is it,\" asked Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"that I didn't see him? Bring him along and\nlet me have a look at him!\"\n\n\"He's separated,\" they all ventured as they laughed, \"by a distance of\ntwenty or thirty li, and how can he be brought along? but you'll see him\nsome day.\"\n\nAs they were talking, they reached the interior of Mrs. Ch'in's\napartments. As soon as they got in, a very faint puff of sweet fragrance\nwas wafted into their nostrils. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc readily felt his eyes itch and\nhis bones grow weak. \"What a fine smell!\" he exclaimed several\nconsecutive times.\n\nUpon entering the apartments, and gazing at the partition wall, he saw a\npicture the handiwork of T'ang Po-hu, consisting of Begonias drooping in\nthe spring time; on either side of which was one of a pair of scrolls,\nwritten by Ch'in Tai-hs\u00c3\u00bc, a Literary Chancellor of the Sung era, running\nas follows:\n\n  A gentle chill doth circumscribe the dreaming man, because the spring\n      is cold.\n  The fragrant whiff, which wafts itself into man's nose, is the perfume\n      of wine!\n\nOn the table was a mirror, one which had been placed, in days of yore,\nin the Mirror Palace of the Emperor Wu Tse-t'ien. On one side stood a\ngold platter, in which Fei Yen, who lived in the Ch'ao state, used to\nstand and dance. In this platter, was laid a quince, which An Lu-shan\nhad flung at the Empress T'ai Chen, inflicting a wound on her breast. In\nthe upper part of the room, stood a divan ornamented with gems, on which\nthe Emperor's daughter, Shou Ch'ang, was wont to sleep, in the Han Chang\nPalace Hanging, were curtains embroidered with strings of pearls, by\nT'ung Ch'ang, the Imperial Princess.\n\n\"It's nice in here, it's nice in here,\" exclaimed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc with a chuckle.\n\n\"This room of mine,\" observed Mrs. Ch'in smilingly, \"is I think, good\nenough for even spirits to live in!\" and, as she uttered these words,\nshe with her own hands, opened a gauze coverlet, which had been washed\nby Hsi Shih, and removed a bridal pillow, which had been held in the\narms of Hung Niang. Instantly, the nurses attended to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, until he\nhad laid down comfortably; when they quietly dispersed, leaving only the\nfour waiting maids: Hsi Jen, Ch'iu Wen, Ch'ing Wen and She Yueh to keep\nhim company.\n\n\"Mind be careful, as you sit under the eaves,\" Mrs. Ch'in recommended\nthe young waiting maids, \"that the cats do not start a fight!\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc then closed his eyes, and, little by little, became drowsy, and\nfell asleep.\n\nIt seemed to him just as if Mrs. Ch'in was walking ahead of him.\nForthwith, with listless and unsettled step, he followed Mrs. Ch'in to\nsome spot or other, where he saw carnation-like railings, jade-like\nsteps, verdant trees and limpid pools--a spot where actually no trace of\nany human being could be met with, where of the shifting mundane dust\nlittle had penetrated.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc felt, in his dream, quite delighted. \"This place,\" he mused, \"is\npleasant, and I may as well spend my whole lifetime in here! though I\nmay have to lose my home, I'm quite ready for the sacrifice, for it's\nfar better being here than being flogged, day after day, by father,\nmother, and teacher.\"\n\nWhile he pondered in this erratic strain, he suddenly heard the voice of\nsome human being at the back of the rocks, giving vent to this song:\n\n  Like scattering clouds doth fleet a vernal dream;\n  The transient flowers pass like a running stream;\n  Maidens and youths bear this, ye all, in mind;\n  In useless grief what profit will ye find?\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc perceived that the voice was that of a girl. The song was barely\nat an end, when he soon espied in the opposite direction, a beautiful\ngirl advancing with majestic and elastic step; a girl quite unlike any\nordinary mortal being. There is this poem, which gives an adequate\ndescription of her:\n\n  Lo she just quits the willow bank; and sudden now she issues from the\n      flower-bedecked house;\n  As onward alone she speeds, she startles the birds perched in the\n      trees, by the pavilion; to which as she draws nigh, her shadow\n      flits by the verandah!\n  Her fairy clothes now flutter in the wind! a fragrant perfume like\n      unto musk or olea is wafted in the air; Her apparel lotus-like is\n      sudden wont to move; and the jingle of her ornaments strikes the\n      ear.\n  Her dimpled cheeks resemble, as they smile, a vernal peach; her\n      kingfisher coiffure is like a cumulus of clouds; her lips part\n      cherry-like; her pomegranate-like teeth conceal a fragrant\n      breath.\n  Her slender waist, so beauteous to look at, is like the skipping snow\n      wafted by a gust of wind; the sheen of her pearls and kingfisher\n      trinkets abounds with splendour, green as the feathers of a duck,\n      and yellow as the plumes of a goose;\n  Now she issues to view, and now is hidden among the flowers; beautiful\n      she is when displeased, beautiful when in high spirits; with\n      lissome step, she treads along the pond, as if she soars on wings\n      or sways in the air.\n  Her eyebrows are crescent moons, and knit under her smiles; she\n      speaks, and yet she seems no word to utter; her lotus-like feet\n      with ease pursue their course; she stops, and yet she seems still\n      to be in motion; the charms of her figure all vie with ice in\n      purity, and in splendour with precious gems; Lovely is her\n      brilliant attire, so full of grandeur and refined grace.\n  Loveable her countenance, as if moulded from some fragrant substance,\n      or carved from white jade; elegant is her person, like a phoenix,\n      dignified like a dragon soaring high.\n  What is her chastity like? Like a white plum in spring with snow\n      nestling in its broken skin; Her purity? Like autumn orchids\n      bedecked with dewdrops.\n  Her modesty? Like a fir-tree growing in a barren plain; Her\n      comeliness? Like russet clouds reflected in a limpid pool.\n  Her gracefulness? Like a dragon in motion wriggling in a stream;\n      Her refinement? Like the rays of the moon shooting on to a cool\n      river.\n  Sure is she to put Hsi Tzu to shame! Bound to put Wang Ch'iang to the\n      blush! What a remarkable person! Where was she born? and whence\n      does she come?\n  One thing is true that in Fairy-land there is no second like her! that\n      in the Purple Courts of Heaven there is no one fit to be her peer!\n  Forsooth, who can it be, so surpassingly beautiful!\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, upon realising that she was a fairy, was much elated; and with\neagerness advanced and made a bow.\n\n\"My divine sister,\" he ventured, as he put on a smile. \"I don't know\nwhence you come, and whither you are going. Nor have I any idea what\nthis place is, but I make bold to entreat that you would take my hand\nand lead me on.\"\n\n\"My abode,\" replied the Fairy, \"is above the Heavens of Divested\nAnimosities, and in the ocean of Discharged Sorrows. I'm the Fairy of\nMonitory Vision, of the cave of Drooping Fragrance, in the mount of\nEmitted Spring, within the confines of the Great Void. I preside over\nthe voluptuous affections and sensual debts among the mortal race, and\nsupervise in the dusty world, the envies of women and the lusts of man.\nIt's because I've recently come to hear that the retribution for\nvoluptuousness extends up to this place, that I betake myself here in\norder to find suitable opportunities of disseminating mutual affections.\nMy encounter with you now is also not a matter of accident! This spot is\nnot distant from my confines. I have nothing much there besides a cup of\nthe tender buds of tea plucked by my own hands, and a pitcher of\nluscious wine, fermented by me as well as several spritelike singing and\ndancing maidens of great proficiency, and twelve ballads of spiritual\nsong, recently completed, on the Dream of the Red Chamber; but won't you\ncome along with me for a stroll?\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, at this proposal, felt elated to such an extraordinary degree\nthat he could skip from joy, and there and then discarding from his mind\nall idea of where Mrs. Ch'in was, he readily followed the Fairy.\n\nThey reached some spot, where there was a stone tablet, put up in a\nhorizontal position, on which were visible the four large characters:\n\"The confines of the Great Void,\" on either side of which was one of a\npair of scrolls, with the two antithetical sentences:\n\n  When falsehood stands for truth, truth likewise becomes false;\n  When naught be made to aught, aught changes into naught!\n\nPast the Portal stood the door of a Palace, and horizontally, above this\ndoor, were the four large characters: \"The Sea of Retribution, the\nHeaven of Love.\" There were also a pair of scrolls, with the inscription\nin large characters:\n\n  Passion, alas! thick as the earth, and lofty as the skies, from ages\n      past to the present hath held incessant sway;\n  How pitiful your lot! ye lustful men and women envious, that your\n      voluptuous debts should be so hard to pay!\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, after perusal, communed with his own heart. \"Is it really so!\"\nhe thought, \"but I wonder what implies the passion from old till now,\nand what are the voluptuous debts! Henceforward, I must enlighten\nmyself!\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc was bent upon this train of thoughts when he unwittingly\nattracted several evil spirits into his heart, and with speedy step he\nfollowed in the track of the fairy, and entered two rows of doors when\nhe perceived that the Lateral Halls were, on both sides, full of tablets\nand scrolls, the number of which he could not in one moment ascertain.\nHe however discriminated in numerous places the inscriptions: The Board\nof Lustful Love; the Board of contracted grudges; The Board of Matutinal\nsobs; the Board of nocturnal tears; the Board of vernal affections; and\nthe Board of autumnal anguish.\n\nAfter he had perused these inscriptions, he felt impelled to turn round\nand address the Fairy. \"May I venture to trouble my Fairy,\" he said, \"to\ntake me along for a turn into the interior of each of these Boards? May\nI be allowed, I wonder, to do so?\"\n\n\"Inside each of these Boards,\" explained the Fairy, \"are accumulated the\nregisters with the records of all women of the whole world; of those who\nhave passed away, as well as of those who have not as yet come into it,\nand you, with your mortal eyes and human body, could not possibly be\nallowed to know anything in anticipation.\"\n\nBut would Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, upon hearing these words, submit to this decree? He\nwent on to implore her permission again and again, until the Fairy\ncasting her eye upon the tablet of the board in front of her observed,\n\"Well, all right! you may go into this board and reap some transient\npleasure.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc was indescribably joyous, and, as he raised his head, he\nperceived that the text on the tablet consisted of the three characters:\nthe Board of Ill-fated lives; and that on each side was a scroll with\nthe inscription:\n\n  Upon one's self are mainly brought regrets in spring and autumn gloom;\n  A face, flowerlike may be and moonlike too; but beauty all for whom?\n\nUpon perusal of the scroll Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was, at once, the more stirred with\nadmiration; and, as he crossed the door, and reached the interior, the\nonly things that struck his eye were about ten large presses, the whole\nnumber of which were sealed with paper slips; on every one of these\nslips, he perceived that there were phrases peculiar to each province.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc was in his mind merely bent upon discerning, from the rest, the\nslip referring to his own native village, when he espied, on the other\nside, a slip with the large characters: \"the Principal Record of the\nTwelve Maidens of Chin Ling.\"\n\n\"What is the meaning,\" therefore inquired Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"of the Principal\nRecord of the Twelve Maidens of Chin Ling?\"\n\n\"As this is the record,\" explained the Fairy, \"of the most excellent and\nprominent girls in your honourable province, it is, for this reason,\ncalled the Principal Record.\"\n\n\"I've often heard people say,\" observed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"that Chin Ling is of\nvast extent; and how can there only be twelve maidens in it! why, at\npresent, in our own family alone, there are more or less several\nhundreds of young girls!\"\n\nThe Fairy gave a faint smile. \"Through there be,\" she rejoined, \"so\nlarge a number of girls in your honourable province, those only of any\nnote have been selected and entered in this record. The two presses, on\nthe two sides, contain those who are second best; while, for all who\nremain, as they are of the ordinary run, there are, consequently, no\nregisters to make any entry of them in.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc upon looking at the press below, perceived the inscription:\n\"Secondary Record of the twelve girls of Chin Ling;\" while again in\nanother press was inscribed: \"Supplementary Secondary Record of the\nTwelve girls of Chin Ling.\" Forthwith stretching out his hand, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\nopened first the doors of the press, containing the \"supplementary\nsecondary Record,\" extracted a volume of the registers, and opened it.\nWhen he came to examine it, he saw on the front page a representation of\nsomething, which, though bearing no resemblance to a human being,\npresented, at the same time, no similitude to scenery; consisting simply\nof huge blotches made with ink. The whole paper was full of nothing else\nbut black clouds and turbid mists, after which appeared the traces of a\nfew characters, explaining that--\n\n  A cloudless moon is rare forsooth to see,\n  And pretty clouds so soon scatter and flee!\n  Thy heart is deeper than the heavens are high,\n  Thy frame consists of base ignominy!\n  Thy looks and clever mind resentment will provoke,\n  And thine untimely death vile slander will evoke!\n  A loving noble youth in vain for love will yearn.\n\nAfter reading these lines, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc looked below, where was pictured a\nbouquet of fresh flowers and a bed covered with tattered matting. There\nwere also several distiches running as follows:\n\n  Thy self-esteem for kindly gentleness is but a fancy vain!\n  Thy charms that they can match the olea or orchid, but thoughts inane!\n  While an actor will, envious lot! with fortune's smiles be born,\n  A youth of noble birth will, strange to say, be luckless and forlorn.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc perused these sentences, but could not unfold their meaning, so,\nat once discarding this press, he went over and opened the door of the\npress of the \"Secondary Records\" and took out a book, in which, on\nexamination, he found a representation of a twig of Olea fragrans.\nBelow, was a pond, the water of which was parched up and the mud dry,\nthe lotus flowers decayed, and even the roots dead. At the back were\nthese lines:\n\n  The lotus root and flower but one fragrance will give;\n  How deep alas! the wounds of thy life's span will be;\n  What time a desolate tree in two places will live,\n  Back to its native home the fragrant ghost will flee!\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc read these lines, but failed to understand what they meant. He\nthen went and fetched the \"Principal Record,\" and set to looking it\nover. He saw on the first page a picture of two rotten trees, while on\nthese trees was suspended a jade girdle. There was also a heap of snow,\nand under this snow was a golden hair-pin. There were in addition these\nfour lines in verse:\n\n  Bitter thy cup will be, e'en were the virtue thine to stop the loom,\n  Thine though the gift the willow fluff to sing, pity who will thy\n      doom?\n  High in the trees doth hang the girdle of white jade,\n  And lo! among the snow the golden pin is laid!\n\nTo Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc the meaning was again, though he read the lines over, quite\nunintelligible. He was, about to make inquiries, but he felt convinced\nthat the Fairy would be both to divulge the decrees of Heaven; and\nthough intent upon discarding the book, he could not however tear\nhimself away from it. Forthwith, therefore, he prosecuted a further\nperusal of what came next, when he caught sight of a picture of a bow.\nOn this bow hung a citron. There was also this ode:\n\n  Full twenty years right and wrong to expound will be thy fate!\n  What place pomegranate blossoms come in bloom will face the Palace\n      Gate!\n  The third portion of spring, of the first spring in beauty short will\n      fall!\n  When tiger meets with hare thou wilt return to sleep perennial.\n\nFurther on, was also a sketch of two persons flying a kite; a broad\nexpanse of sea, and a large vessel; while in this vessel was a girl, who\nscreened her face bedewed with tears. These four lines were likewise\nvisible:\n\n  Pure and bright will be thy gifts, thy purpose very high;\n  But born thou wilt be late in life and luck be passed by;\n  At the tomb feast thou wilt repine tearful along the stream,\n  East winds may blow, but home miles off will be, even in dream.\n\nAfter this followed a picture of several streaks of fleeting clouds, and\nof a creek whose waters were exhausted, with the text:\n\n  Riches and honours too what benefit are they?\n  In swaddling clothes thou'lt be when parents pass away;\n  The rays will slant, quick as the twinkle of an eye;\n  The Hsiang stream will recede, the Ch'u clouds onward fly!\n\nThen came a picture of a beautiful gem, which had fallen into the mire,\nwith the verse:\n\n  Thine aim is chastity, but chaste thou wilt not be;\n  Abstraction is thy faith, but void thou may'st not see;\n  Thy precious, gemlike self will, pitiful to say,\n  Into the mundane mire collapse at length some day.\n\nA rough sketch followed of a savage wolf, in pursuit of a beautiful\ngirl, trying to pounce upon her as he wished to devour her. This was the\nburden of the distich:\n\n  Thy mate is like a savage wolf prowling among the hills;\n  His wish once gratified a haughty spirit his heart fills!\n  Though fair thy form like flowers or willows in the golden moon,\n  Upon the yellow beam to hang will shortly be its doom.\n\nBelow, was an old temple, in the interior of which was a beautiful\nperson, just in the act of reading the religious manuals, as she sat all\nalone; with this inscription:\n\n  In light esteem thou hold'st the charms of the three springs for their\n      short-liv'd fate;\n  Thine attire of past years to lay aside thou chang'st, a Taoist dress\n      to don;\n  How sad, alas! of a reputed house and noble kindred the scion,\n  Alone, behold! she sleeps under a glimmering light, an old idol for\n      mate.\n\nNext in order came a hill of ice, on which stood a hen-phoenix, while\nunder it was this motto:\n\n  When time ends, sure coincidence, the phoenix doth alight;\n  The talents of this human form all know and living see,\n  For first to yield she kens, then to control, and third genial to be;\n  But sad to say, things in Chin Ling are in more sorry plight.\n\nThis was succeeded by a representation of a desolate village, and a\ndreary inn. A pretty girl sat in there, spinning thread. These were the\nsentiments affixed below:\n\n  When riches will have flown will honours then avail?\n  When ruin breaks your home, e'en relatives will fail!\n  But sudden through the aid extended to Dame Liu,\n  A friend in need fortune will make to rise for you.\n\nFollowing these verses, was drawn a pot of Orchids, by the side of\nwhich, was a beautiful maiden in a phoenix-crown and cloudy mantle\n(bridal dress); and to this picture was appended this device:\n\n  What time spring wanes, then fades the bloom of peach as well as plum!\n  Who ever can like a pot of the olea be winsome!\n  With ice thy purity will vie, vain their envy will be!\n  In vain a laughing-stock people will try to make of thee.\n\nAt the end of this poetical device, came the representation of a lofty\nedifice, on which was a beauteous girl, suspending herself on a beam to\ncommit suicide; with this verse:\n\n  Love high as heav'n, love ocean-wide, thy lovely form will don;\n  What time love will encounter love, license must rise wanton;\n  Why hold that all impiety in Jung doth find its spring,\n  The source of trouble, verily, is centred most in Ning.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc was still bent upon prosecuting his perusal, when the Fairy\nperceiving that his intellect was eminent and bright, and his natural\ntalents quickwitted, and apprehending lest the decrees of heaven should\nbe divulged, hastily closed the Book of Record, and addressed herself to\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc. \"Come along with me,\" she said smiling, \"and see some wonderful\nscenery. What's the need of staying here and beating this gourd of\nennui?\"\n\nIn a dazed state, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc listlessly discarded the record, and again\nfollowed in the footsteps of the Fairy. On their arrival at the back, he\nsaw carnation porti\u00c3\u00a8res, and embroidered curtains, ornamented pillars,\nand carved eaves. But no words can adequately give an idea of the\nvermilion apartments glistening with splendour, of the floors garnished\nwith gold, of the snow reflecting lustrous windows, of the palatial\nmansions made of gems. He also saw fairyland flowers, beautiful and\nfragrant, and extraordinary vegetation, full of perfume. The spot was\nindeed elysian.\n\nHe again heard the Fairy observe with a smiling face: \"Come out all of\nyou at once and greet the honoured guest!\"\n\nThese words were scarcely completed, when he espied fairies walk out of\nthe mansion, all of whom were, with their dangling lotus sleeves, and\ntheir fluttering feather habiliments, as comely as spring flowers, and\nas winsome as the autumn moon. As soon as they caught sight of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc,\nthey all, with one voice, resentfully reproached the Monitory Vision\nFairy. \"Ignorant as to who the honoured guest could be,\" they argued,\n\"we hastened to come out to offer our greetings simply because you,\nelder sister, had told us that, on this day, and at this very time,\nthere would be sure to come on a visit, the spirit of the younger sister\nof Chiang Chu. That's the reason why we've been waiting for ever so\nlong; and now why do you, in lieu of her, introduce this vile object to\ncontaminate the confines of pure and spotless maidens?\"\n\nAs soon as Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc heard these remarks, he was forthwith plunged in such\na state of consternation that he would have retired, but he found it\nimpossible to do so. In fact, he felt the consciousness of the foulness\nand corruption of his own nature quite intolerable. The Monitory Vision\nFairy promptly took Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's hand in her own, and turning towards her\nyounger sisters, smiled and explained: \"You, and all of you, are not\naware of the why and wherefore. To-day I did mean to have gone to the\nJung mansion to fetch Chiang Chu, but as I went by the Ning mansion, I\nunexpectedly came across the ghosts of the two dukes of Jung and Ning,\nwho addressed me in this wise: 'Our family has, since the dynasty\nestablished itself on the Throne, enjoyed merit and fame, which pervaded\nmany ages, and riches and honours transmitted from generation to\ngeneration. One hundred years have already elapsed, but this good\nfortune has now waned, and this propitious luck is exhausted; so much so\nthat they could not be retrieved! Our sons and grandsons may be many,\nbut there is no one among them who has the means to continue the family\nestate, with the exception of our kindred grandson, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc alone, who,\nthough perverse in disposition and wayward by nature, is nevertheless\nintelligent and quick-witted and qualified in a measure to give effect\nto our hopes. But alas! the good fortune of our family is entirely\ndecayed, so that we fear there is no person to incite him to enter the\nright way! Fortunately you worthy fairy come at an unexpected moment,\nand we venture to trust that you will, above all things, warn him\nagainst the foolish indulgence of inordinate desire, lascivious\naffections and other such things, in the hope that he may, at your\ninstigation, be able to escape the snares of those girls who will allure\nhim with their blandishments, and to enter on the right track; and we\ntwo brothers will be ever grateful.'\n\n\"On language such as this being addressed to me, my feelings of\ncommiseration naturally burst forth; and I brought him here, and bade\nhim, first of all, carefully peruse the records of the whole lives of\nthe maidens in his family, belonging to the three grades, the upper,\nmiddle and lower, but as he has not yet fathomed the import, I have\nconsequently led him into this place to experience the vision of\ndrinking, eating, singing and licentious love, in the hope, there is no\nsaying, of his at length attaining that perception.\"\n\nHaving concluded these remarks, she led Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc by the hand into the\napartment, where he felt a whiff of subtle fragrance, but what it was\nthat reached his nostrils he could not tell.\n\nTo Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's eager and incessant inquiries, the Fairy made reply with a\nsardonic smile. \"This perfume,\" she said, \"is not to be found in the\nworld, and how could you discern what it is? This is made of the essence\nof the first sprouts of rare herbs, growing on all hills of fame and\nplaces of superior excellence, admixed with the oil of every species of\nsplendid shrubs in precious groves, and is called the marrow of\nConglomerated Fragrance.\"\n\nAt these words Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was, of course, full of no other feeling than\nwonder.\n\nThe whole party advanced and took their seats, and a young maidservant\npresented tea, which Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc found of pure aroma, of excellent flavour\nand of no ordinary kind. \"What is the name of this tea?\" he therefore\nasked; upon which the Fairy explained. \"This tea,\" she added,\n\"originates from the Hills of Emitted Spring and the Valley of Drooping\nFragrance, and is, besides, brewed in the night dew, found on spiritual\nplants and divine leaves. The name of this tea is 'one thousand red in\none hole.'\"\n\nAt these words Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc nodded his head, and extolled its qualities.\nEspying in the room lutes, with jasper mountings, and tripods, inlaid\nwith gems, antique paintings, and new poetical works, which were to be\nseen everywhere, he felt more than ever in a high state of delight.\nBelow the windows, were also shreds of velvet sputtered about and a\ntoilet case stained with the traces of time and smudged with cosmetic;\nwhile on the partition wall was likewise suspended a pair of scrolls,\nwith the inscription:\n\n  A lonesome, small, ethereal, beauteous nook!\n  What help is there, but Heaven's will to brook?\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc having completed his inspection felt full of admiration, and\nproceeded to ascertain the names and surnames of the Fairies. One was\ncalled the Fairy of Lustful Dreams; another \"the High Ruler of\nPropagated Passion;\" the name of one was \"the Golden Maiden of\nPerpetuated Sorrow;\" of another the \"Intelligent Maiden of Transmitted\nHatred.\" (In fact,) the respective Taoist appellations were not of one\nand the same kind.\n\nIn a short while, young maid-servants came in and laid the table, put\nthe chairs in their places, and spread out wines and eatables. There\nwere actually crystal tankards overflowing with luscious wines, and\namber glasses full to the brim with pearly strong liquors. But still\nless need is there to give any further details about the sumptuousness\nof the refreshments.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc found it difficult, on account of the unusual purity of the\nbouquet of the wine, to again restrain himself from making inquiries\nabout it.\n\n\"This wine,\" observed the Monitory Dream Fairy, \"is made of the twigs of\nhundreds of flowers, and the juice of ten thousands of trees, with the\naddition of must composed of unicorn marrow, and yeast prepared with\nphoenix milk. Hence the name of 'Ten thousand Beauties in one Cup' was\ngiven to it.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc sang its incessant praise, and, while he sipped his wine, twelve\ndancing girls came forward, and requested to be told what songs they\nwere to sing.\n\n\"Take,\" suggested the Fairy, \"the newly-composed Twelve Sections of the\nDream of the Red Chamber, and sing them.\"\n\nThe singing girls signified their obedience, and forthwith they lightly\nclapped the castagnettes and gently thrummed the virginals. These were\nthe words which they were heard to sing:\n\n  At the time of the opening of the heavens and the laying out of the\n      earth chaos prevailed.\n\nThey had just sung this one line when the Fairy exclaimed: \"This ballad\nis unlike the ballads written in the dusty world whose purport is to\nhand down remarkable events, in which the distinction of scholars,\ngirls, old men and women, and fools is essential, and in which are\nfurthermore introduced the lyrics of the Southern and Northern Palaces.\nThese fairy songs consist either of elegaic effusions on some person or\nimpressions of some occurrence or other, and are impromptu songs readily\nset to the music of wind or string instruments, so that any one who is\nnot cognisant of their gist cannot appreciate the beauties contained in\nthem. So you are not likely, I fear, to understand this lyric with any\nclearness; and unless you first peruse the text and then listen to the\nballad, you will, instead of pleasure, feel as if you were chewing wax\n(devoid of any zest).\"\n\nAfter these remarks, she turned her head round, and directed a young\nmaid-servant to fetch the text of the Dream of the Red Chamber, which\nshe handed to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, who took it over; and as he followed the words\nwith his eyes, with his ears he listened to the strains of this song:\n\nPreface of the Bream of the Red Chamber.--When the Heavens were opened\nand earth was laid out chaos prevailed! What was the germ of love? It\narises entirely from the strength of licentious love.\n\nWhat day, by the will of heaven, I felt wounded at heart, and what time\nI was at leisure, I made an attempt to disburden my sad heart; and with\nthis object in view I indited this Dream of the Bed Chamber, on the\nsubject of a disconsolate gold trinket and an unfortunate piece of jade.\n\nWaste of a whole Lifetime. All maintain that the match between gold and\njade will be happy. All I can think of is the solemn oath contracted in\ndays gone by by the plant and stone! Vain will I gaze upon the snow,\nHs\u00c3\u00bceh, [Pao-ch'ai], pure as crystal and lustrous like a gem of the\neminent priest living among the hills! Never will I forget the noiseless\nFairy Grove, Lin [Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc], beyond the confines of the mortal world!\nAlas! now only have I come to believe that human happiness is\nincomplete; and that a couple may be bound by the ties of wedlock for\nlife, but that after all their hearts are not easy to lull into\ncontentment.\n\nVain knitting of the brows. The one is a spirit flower of Fairyland; the\nother is a beautiful jade without a blemish. Do you maintain that their\nunion will not be remarkable? Why how then is it that he has come to\nmeet her again in this existence? If the union will you say, be strange,\nhow is it then that their love affair will be but empty words? The one\nin her loneliness will give way to useless sighs. The other in vain will\nyearn and crave. The one will be like the reflection of the moon in\nwater; the other like a flower reflected in a mirror. Consider, how many\ndrops of tears can there be in the eyes? and how could they continue to\ndrop from autumn to winter and from spring to flow till summer time?\n\nBut to come to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. After he had heard these ballads, so diffuse and\nvague, he failed to see any point of beauty in them; but the plaintive\nmelody of the sound was nevertheless sufficient to drive away his spirit\nand exhilarate his soul. Hence it was that he did not make any inquiries\nabout the arguments, and that he did not ask about the matter treated,\nbut simply making these ballads the means for the time being of\ndispelling melancholy, he therefore went on with the perusal of what\ncame below.\n\nDespicable Spirit of Death! You will be rejoicing that glory is at its\nheight when hateful death will come once again, and with eyes wide with\nhorror, you will discard all things, and dimly and softly the fragrant\nspirit will waste and dissolve! You will yearn for native home, but\ndistant will be the way, and lofty the mountains. Hence it is that you\nwill betake yourself in search of father and mother, while they lie\nunder the influence of a dream, and hold discourse with them. \"Your\nchild,\" you will say, \"has already trodden the path of death! Oh my\nparents, it behoves you to speedily retrace your steps and make good\nyour escape!\"\n\nSeparated from Relatives. You will speed on a journey of three thousand\nli at the mercy of wind and rain, and tear yourself from all your family\nties and your native home! Your fears will be lest anguish should do any\nharm to your parents in their failing years! \"Father and mother,\" you\nwill bid them, \"do not think with any anxiety of your child. From ages\npast poverty as well as success have both had a fixed destiny; and is it\nlikely that separation and reunion are not subject to predestination?\nThough we may now be far apart in two different places, we must each of\nus try and preserve good cheer. Your abject child has, it is true, gone\nfrom home, but abstain from distressing yourselves on her account!\"\n\nSorrow in the midst of Joy. While wrapped as yet in swaddling clothes,\nfather and mother, both alas! will depart, and dwell though you will in\nthat mass of gauze, who is there who will know how to spoil you with any\nfond attention? Born you will be fortunately with ample moral courage,\nand high-minded and boundless resources, for your parents will not have,\nin the least, their child's secret feelings at heart! You will be like a\nmoon appearing to view when the rain holds up, shedding its rays upon\nthe Jade Hall; or a gentle breeze (wafting its breath upon it). Wedded\nto a husband, fairy like fair and accomplished, you will enjoy a\nhappiness enduring as the earth and perennial as the Heavens! and you\nwill be the means of snapping asunder the bitter fate of your youth!\nBut, after all, the clouds will scatter in Kao T'ang and the waters of\nthe Hsiang river will get parched! This is the inevitable destiny of\ndissolution and continuance which prevails in the mortal world, and what\nneed is there to indulge in useless grief?\n\nIntolerable to the world. Your figure will be as winsome as an olea\nfragrans; your talents as ample as those of a Fairy! You will by nature\nbe so haughty that of the whole human race few will be like you! You\nwill look upon a meat diet as one of dirt, and treat splendour as coarse\nand loathsome! And yet you will not be aware that your high notions will\nbring upon you the excessive hatred of man! You will be very eager in\nyour desire after chastity, but the human race will despise you! Alas,\nyou will wax old in that antique temple hall under a faint light, where\nyou will waste ungrateful for beauty, looks and freshness! But after all\nyou will still be worldly, corrupt and unmindful of your vows; just like\na spotless white jade you will be whose fate is to fall into the mire!\nAnd what need will there be for the grandson of a prince or the son of a\nduke to deplore that his will not be the good fortune (of winning your\naffections)?\n\nThe Voluptuary. You will resemble a wolf in the mountains! a savage\nbeast devoid of all human feeling! Regardless in every way of the\nobligations of days gone by, your sole pleasure will be in the\nindulgence of haughtiness, extravagance, licentiousness and dissolute\nhabits! You will be inordinate in your conjugal affections, and look\ndown upon the beautiful charms of the child of a marquis, as if they\nwere cat-tail rush or willow; trampling upon the honourable daughter of\na ducal mansion, as if she were one of the common herd. Pitiful to say,\nthe fragrant spirit and beauteous ghost will in a year softly and gently\npass away!\n\nThe Perception that all things are transient like flowers. You will look\nlightly upon the three springs and regard the blush of the peach and the\ngreen of the willow as of no avail. You will beat out the fire of\nsplendour, and treat solitary retirement as genial! What is it that you\nsay about the delicate peaches in the heavens (marriage) being\nexcellent, and the petals of the almond in the clouds being plentiful\n(children)? Let him who has after all seen one of them, (really a mortal\nbeing) go safely through the autumn, (wade safely through old age),\nbehold the people in the white Poplar village groan and sigh; and the\nspirits under the green maple whine and moan! Still more wide in expanse\nthan even the heavens is the dead vegetation which covers the graves!\nThe moral is this, that the burden of man is poverty one day and\naffluence another; that bloom in spring, and decay in autumn, constitute\nthe doom of vegetable life! In the same way, this calamity of birth and\nthe visitation of death, who is able to escape? But I have heard it said\nthat there grows in the western quarter a tree called the P'o So\n(Patient Bearing) which bears the fruit of Immortal life!\n\nThe bane of Intelligence. Yours will be the power to estimate, in a\nthorough manner, the real motives of all things, as yours will be\nintelligence of an excessive degree; but instead (of reaping any\nbenefit) you will cast the die of your own existence! The heart of your\nprevious life is already reduced to atoms, and when you shall have died,\nyour nature will have been intelligent to no purpose! Your home will be\nin easy circumstances; your family will enjoy comforts; but your\nconnexions will, at length, fall a prey to death, and the inmates of\nyour family scatter, each one of you speeding in a different direction,\nmaking room for others! In vain, you will have harassed your mind with\ncankering thoughts for half a lifetime; for it will be just as if you\nhad gone through the confused mazes of a dream on the third watch!\nSudden a crash (will be heard) like the fall of a spacious palace, and a\ndusky gloominess (will supervene) such as is caused by a lamp about to\nspend itself! Alas! a spell of happiness will be suddenly (dispelled by)\nadversity! Woe is man in the world! for his ultimate doom is difficult\nto determine!\n\nLeave behind a residue of happiness! Hand down an excess of happiness;\nhand down an excess of happiness! Unexpectedly you will come across a\nbenefactor! Fortunate enough your mother, your own mother, will have\nlaid by a store of virtue and secret meritorious actions! My advice to\nyou, mankind, is to relieve the destitute and succour the distressed! Do\nnot resemble those who will harp after lucre and show themselves\nunmindful of the ties of relationship: that wolflike maternal uncle of\nyours and that impostor of a brother! True it is that addition and\nsubtraction, increase and decrease, (reward and punishment,) rest in the\nhands of Heaven above!\n\nSplendour at last. Loving affection in a mirror will be still more\nephemeral than fame in a dream. That fine splendour will fleet how soon!\nMake no further allusion to embroidered curtain, to bridal coverlet; for\nthough you may come to wear on your head a pearl-laden coronet, and, on\nyour person, a jacket ornamented with phoenixes, yours will not\nnevertheless be the means to atone for the short life (of your husband)!\nThough the saying is that mankind should not have, in their old age, the\nburden of poverty to bear, yet it is also essential that a store of\nbenevolent deeds should be laid up for the benefit of sons and\ngrandsons! (Your son) may come to be dignified in appearance and wear on\nhis head the official tassel, and on his chest may be suspended the gold\nseal resplendent in lustre; he may be imposing in his majesty, and he\nmay rise high in status and emoluments, but the dark and dreary way\nwhich leads to death is short! Are the generals and ministers who have\nbeen from ages of old still in the flesh, forsooth? They exist only in a\nfutile name handed down to posterity to reverence!\n\nDeath ensues when things propitious reign! Upon the ornamented beam will\nsettle at the close of spring the fragrant dust! Your reckless\nindulgence of licentious love and your naturally moonlike face will soon\nbe the source of the ruin of a family. The decadence of the family\nestate will emanate entirely from Ching; while the wane of the family\naffairs will be entirely attributable to the fault of Ning! Licentious\nlove will be the main reason of the long-standing grudge.\n\nThe flying birds each perch upon the trees! The family estates of those\nin official positions will fade! The gold and silver of the rich and\nhonoured will be scattered! those who will have conferred benefit will,\neven in death, find the means of escape! those devoid of human feelings\nwill reap manifest retribution! Those indebted for a life will make, in\ndue time, payment with their lives; those indebted for tears have\nalready (gone) to exhaust their tears! Mutual injuries will be revenged\nin no light manner! Separation and reunion will both alike be determined\nby predestination! You wish to know why your life will be short; look\ninto your previous existence! Verily, riches and honours, which will\ncome with old age, will likewise be a question of chance! Those who will\nhold the world in light esteem will retire within the gate of\nabstraction; while those who will be allured by enticement will have\nforfeited their lives (The Chia family will fulfil its destiny) as\nsurely as birds take to the trees after they have exhausted all they had\nto eat, and which as they drop down will pile up a hoary, vast and lofty\nheap of dust, (leaving) indeed a void behind!\n\nWhen the maidens had finished the ballads, they went on to sing the\n\"Supplementary Record;\" but the Monitory Vision Fairy, perceiving the\ntotal absence of any interest in Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, heaved a sigh. \"You silly\nbrat!\" she exclaimed. \"What! haven't you, even now, attained\nperception!\"\n\n\"There's no need for you to go on singing,\" speedily observed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, as\nhe interrupted the singing maidens; and feeling drowsy and dull, he\npleaded being under the effects of wine, and begged to be allowed to lie\ndown.\n\nThe Fairy then gave orders to clear away the remains of the feast, and\nescorted Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc to a suite of female apartments, where the splendour of\nsuch objects as were laid out was a thing which he had not hitherto\nseen. But what evoked in him wonder still more intense, was the sight,\nat an early period, of a girl seated in the room, who, in the freshness\nof her beauty and winsomeness of her charms, bore some resemblance to\nPao-ch'ai, while, in elegance and comeliness, on the other hand, to\nTai-yu.\n\nWhile he was plunged in a state of perplexity, the Fairy suddenly\nremarked: \"All those female apartments and ladies' chambers in so many\nwealthy and honourable families in the world are, without exception,\npolluted by voluptuous opulent puppets and by all that bevy of\nprofligate girls. But still more despicable are those from old till now\nnumberless dissolute rou\u00c3\u00a9s, one and all of whom maintain that libidinous\naffections do not constitute lewdness; and who try, further, to prove\nthat licentious love is not tantamount to lewdness. But all these\narguments are mere apologies for their shortcomings, and a screen for\ntheir pollutions; for if libidinous affection be lewdness, still more\ndoes the perception of licentious love constitute lewdness. Hence it is\nthat the indulgence of sensuality and the gratification of licentious\naffection originate entirely from a relish of lust, as well as from a\nhankering after licentious love. Lo you, who are the object of my love,\nare the most lewd being under the heavens from remote ages to the\npresent time!\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc was quite dumbstruck by what he heard, and hastily smiling, he\nsaid by way of reply: \"My Fairy labours under a misapprehension. Simply\nbecause of my reluctance to read my books my parents have, on repeated\noccasions, extended to me injunction and reprimand, and would I have the\ncourage to go so far as to rashly plunge in lewd habits? Besides, I am\nstill young in years, and have no notion what is implied by lewdness!\"\n\n\"Not so!\" exclaimed the Fairy; \"lewdness, although one thing in\nprinciple is, as far as meaning goes, subject to different\nconstructions; as is exemplified by those in the world whose heart is\nset upon lewdness. Some delight solely in faces and figures; others find\ninsatiable pleasure in singing and dancing; some in dalliance and\nraillery; others in the incessant indulgence of their lusts; and these\nregret that all the beautiful maidens under the heavens cannot minister\nto their short-lived pleasure. These several kinds of persons are foul\nobjects steeped skin and all in lewdness. The lustful love, for\ninstance, which has sprung to life and taken root in your natural\naffections, I and such as myself extend to it the character of an\nabstract lewdness; but abstract lewdness can be grasped by the mind, but\ncannot be transmitted by the mouth; can be fathomed by the spirit, but\ncannot be divulged in words. As you now are imbued with this desire only\nin the abstract, you are certainly well fit to be a trustworthy friend\nin (Fairyland) inner apartments, but, on the path of the mortal world,\nyou will inevitably be misconstrued and defamed; every mouth will\nridicule you; every eye will look down upon you with contempt. After\nmeeting recently your worthy ancestors, the two Dukes of Ning and Jung,\nwho opened their hearts and made their wishes known to me with such\nfervour, (but I will not have you solely on account of the splendour of\nour inner apartments look down despisingly upon the path of the world),\nI consequently led you along, my son, and inebriated you with luscious\nwines, steeped you in spiritual tea, and admonished you with excellent\nsongs, bringing also here a young sister of mine, whose infant name is\nChien Mei, and her style K'o Ching, to be given to you as your wedded\nwife. To-night, the time will be propitious and suitable for the\nimmediate consummation of the union, with the express object of letting\nyou have a certain insight into the fact that if the condition of the\nabode of spirits within the confines of Fairyland be still so\n(imperfect), how much the more so should be the nature of the affections\nwhich prevail in the dusty world; with the intent that from this time\nforth you should positively break loose from bondage, perceive and amend\nyour former disposition, devote your attention to the works of Confucius\nand Mencius, and set your steady purpose upon the principles of\nmorality.\"\n\nHaving ended these remarks, she initiated him into the mysteries of\nlicentious love, and, pushing Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc into the room, she closed the door,\nand took her departure all alone. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc in a dazed state complied with\nthe admonitions given him by the Fairy, and the natural result was, of\ncourse, a violent flirtation, the circumstances of which it would be\nimpossible to recount.\n\nWhen the next day came, he was by that time so attached to her by ties\nof tender love and their conversation was so gentle and full of charm\nthat he could not brook to part from K'o Ching. Hand-in-hand, the two of\nthem therefore, went out for a stroll, when they unexpectedly reached a\nplace, where nothing else met their gaze than thorns and brambles, which\ncovered the ground, and a wolf and a tiger walking side by side. Before\nthem stretched the course of a black stream, which obstructed their\nprogress; and over this stream there was, what is more, no bridge to\nenable one to cross it.\n\nWhile they were exercising their minds with perplexity, they suddenly\nespied the Fairy coming from the back in pursuit of them. \"Desist at\nonce,\" she exclaimed, \"from making any advance into the stream; it is\nurgent that you should, with all speed, turn your faces round!\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc lost no time in standing still. \"What is this place?\" he\ninquired.\n\n\"This is the Ford of Enticement,\" explained the Fairy. \"Its depth is ten\nthousand chang; its breadth is a thousand li; in its stream there are no\nboats or paddles by means of which to effect a passage. There is simply\na raft, of which Mu Chu-shih directs the rudder, and which Hui Shih chen\npunts with the poles. They receive no compensation in the shape of gold\nor silver, but when they come across any one whose destiny it is to\ncross, they ferry him over. You now have by accident strolled as far as\nhere, and had you fallen into the stream you would have rendered quite\nuseless the advice and admonition which I previously gave you.\"\n\nThese words were scarcely concluded, when suddenly was heard from the\nmidst of the Ford of Enticement, a sound like unto a peal of thunder,\nwhereupon a whole crowd of gobblins and sea-urchins laid hands upon\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc and dragged him down.\n\nThis so filled Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc with consternation that he fell into a\nperspiration as profuse as rain, and he simultaneously broke forth and\nshouted, \"Rescue me, K'o Ching!\"\n\nThese cries so terrified Hsi Jen and the other waiting-maids, that they\nrushed forward, and taking Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc in their arms, \"Don't be afraid,\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc,\" they said, \"we are here.\"\n\nBut we must observe that Mrs. Ch'in was just inside the apartment in the\nact of recommending the young waiting-maids to be mindful that the cats\nand dogs did not start a fight, when she unawares heard Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, in his\ndream, call her by her infant name. In a melancholy mood she therefore\ncommuned within herself, \"As far as my infant name goes, there is, in\nthis establishment, no one who has any idea what it is, and how is it\nthat he has come to know it, and that he utters it in his dream?\" And\nshe was at this period unable to fathom the reason. But, reader, listen\nto the explanations given in the chapter which follows.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n  Chia Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc reaps his first experience in licentious love.\n  Old Goody Liu pays a visit to the Jung Kuo Mansion.\n\n\nMrs. Ch'in, to resume our narrative, upon hearing Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc call her in his\ndream by her infant name, was at heart very exercised, but she did not\nhowever feel at liberty to make any minute inquiry.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc was, at this time, in such a dazed state, as if he had lost\nsomething, and the servants promptly gave him a decoction of lungngan.\nAfter he had taken a few sips, he forthwith rose and tidied his clothes.\n\nHsi Jen put out her hand to fasten the band of his garment, and as soon\nas she did so, and it came in contact with his person, it felt so icy\ncold to the touch, covered as it was all over with perspiration, that\nshe speedily withdrew her hand in utter surprise.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" she exclaimed.\n\nA blush suffused Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's face, and he took Hsi Jen's hand in a tight\ngrip. Hsi Jen was a girl with all her wits about her; she was besides a\ncouple of years older than Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc and had recently come to know\nsomething of the world, so that at the sight of his state, she to a\ngreat extent readily accounted for the reason in her heart. From modest\nshame, she unconsciously became purple in the face, and not venturing to\nask another question she continued adjusting his clothes. This task\naccomplished, she followed him over to old lady Chia's apartments; and\nafter a hurry-scurry meal, they came back to this side, and Hsi Jen\navailed herself of the absence of the nurses and waiting-maids to hand\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc another garment to change.\n\n\"Please, dear Hsi Jen, don't tell any one,\" entreated Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, with\nconcealed shame.\n\n\"What did you dream of?\" inquired Hsi Jen, smiling, as she tried to\nstifle her blushes, \"and whence comes all this perspiration?\"\n\n\"It's a long story,\" said Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"which only a few words will not\nsuffice to explain.\"\n\nHe accordingly recounted minutely, for her benefit, the subject of his\ndream. When he came to where the Fairy had explained to him the\nmysteries of love, Hsi Jen was overpowered with modesty and covered her\nface with her hands; and as she bent down, she gave way to a fit of\nlaughter. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had always been fond of Hsi Jen, on account of her\ngentleness, pretty looks and graceful and elegant manner, and he\nforthwith expounded to her all the mysteries he had been taught by the\nFairy.\n\nHsi Jen was, of course, well aware that dowager lady Chia had given her\nover to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, so that her present behaviour was likewise no\ntransgression. And subsequently she secretly attempted with Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc a\nviolent flirtation, and lucky enough no one broke in upon them during\ntheir t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate. From this date, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc treated Hsi Jen with special\nregard, far more than he showed to the other girls, while Hsi Jen\nherself was still more demonstrative in her attentions to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. But\nfor a time we will make no further remark about them.\n\nAs regards the household of the Jung mansion, the inmates may, on adding\nup the total number, not have been found many; yet, counting the high as\nwell as the low, there were three hundred persons and more. Their\naffairs may not have been very numerous, still there were, every day,\nten and twenty matters to settle; in fact, the household resembled, in\nevery way, ravelled hemp, devoid even of a clue-end, which could be used\nas an introduction.\n\nJust as we were considering what matter and what person it would be best\nto begin writing of, by a lucky coincidence suddenly from a distance of\na thousand li, a person small and insignificant as a grain of mustard\nseed happened, on account of her distant relationship with the Jung\nfamily, to come on this very day to the Jung mansion on a visit. We\nshall therefore readily commence by speaking of this family, as it after\nall affords an excellent clue for a beginning.\n\nThe surname of this mean and humble family was in point of fact Wang.\nThey were natives of this district. Their ancestor had filled a minor\noffice in the capital, and had, in years gone by, been acquainted with\nlady Feng's grandfather, that is madame Wang's father. Being covetous of\nthe influence and affluence of the Wang family, he consequently joined\nancestors with them, and was recognised by them as a nephew.\n\nAt that time, there were only madame Wang's eldest brother, that is lady\nFeng's father, and madame Wang herself, who knew anything of these\ndistant relations, from the fact of having followed their parents to the\ncapital. The rest of the family had one and all no idea about them.\n\nThis ancestor had, at this date, been dead long ago, leaving only one\nson called Wang Ch'eng. As the family estate was in a state of ruin, he\nonce more moved outside the city walls and settled down in his native\nvillage. Wang Ch'eng also died soon after his father, leaving a son,\nknown in his infancy as Kou Erh, who married a Miss Liu, by whom he had\na son called by the infant name of Pan Erh, as well as a daughter,\nCh'ing Erh. His family consisted of four, and he earned a living from\nfarming.\n\nAs Kou Erh was always busy with something or other during the day and\nhis wife, dame Liu, on the other hand, drew the water, pounded the rice\nand attended to all the other domestic concerns, the brother and sister,\nCh'ing Erh and Pan Erh, the two of them, had no one to look after them.\n(Hence it was that) Kou Erh brought over his mother-in-law, old goody\nLiu, to live with them.\n\nThis goody Liu was an old widow, with a good deal of experience. She had\nbesides no son round her knees, so that she was dependent for her\nmaintenance on a couple of acres of poor land, with the result that when\nher son-in-law received her in his home, she naturally was ever willing\nto exert heart and mind to help her daughter and her son-in-law to earn\ntheir living.\n\nThis year, the autumn had come to an end, winter had commenced, and the\nweather had begun to be quite cold. No provision had been made in the\nhousehold for the winter months, and Kou Erh was, inevitably,\nexceedingly exercised in his heart. Having had several cups of wine to\ndispel his distress, he sat at home and tried to seize upon every trifle\nto give vent to his displeasure. His wife had not the courage to force\nherself in his way, and hence goody Liu it was who encouraged him, as\nshe could not bear to see the state of the domestic affairs.\n\n\"Don't pull me up for talking too much,\" she said; \"but who of us\ncountry people isn't honest and open-hearted? As the size of the bowl we\nhold, so is the quantity of the rice we eat. In your young days, you\nwere dependent on the support of your old father, so that eating and\ndrinking became quite a habit with you; that's how, at the present time,\nyour resources are quite uncertain; when you had money, you looked\nahead, and didn't mind behind; and now that you have no money, you\nblindly fly into huffs. A fine fellow and a capital hero you have made!\nLiving though we now be away from the capital, we are after all at the\nfeet of the Emperor; this city of Ch'ang Ngan is strewn all over with\nmoney, but the pity is that there's no one able to go and fetch it away;\nand it's no use your staying at home and kicking your feet about.\"\n\n\"All you old lady know,\" rejoined Kou Erh, after he had heard what she\nhad to say, \"is to sit on the couch and talk trash! Is it likely you\nwould have me go and play the robber?\"\n\n\"Who tells you to become a robber?\" asked goody Liu. \"But it would be\nwell, after all, that we should put our heads together and devise some\nmeans; for otherwise, is the money, pray, able of itself to run into our\nhouse?\"\n\n\"Had there been a way,\" observed Kou Erh, smiling sarcastically, \"would\nI have waited up to this moment? I have besides no revenue collectors as\nrelatives, or friends in official positions; and what way could we\ndevise? 'But even had I any, they wouldn't be likely, I fear, to pay any\nheed to such as ourselves!\"\n\n\"That, too, doesn't follow,\" remarked goody Liu; \"the planning of\naffairs rests with man, but the accomplishment of them rests with\nHeaven. After we have laid our plans, we may, who can say, by relying on\nthe sustenance of the gods, find some favourable occasion. Leave it to\nme, I'll try and devise some lucky chance for you people! In years gone\nby, you joined ancestors with the Wang family of Chin Ling, and twenty\nyears back, they treated you with consideration; but of late, you've\nbeen so high and mighty, and not condescended to go and bow to them,\nthat an estrangement has arisen. I remember how in years gone by, I and\nmy daughter paid them a visit. The second daughter of the family was\nreally so pleasant and knew so well how to treat people with kindness,\nand without in fact any high airs! She's at present the wife of Mr.\nChia, the second son of the Jung Kuo mansion; and I hear people say that\nnow that she's advanced in years, she's still more considerate to the\npoor, regardful of the old, and very fond of preparing vegetable food\nfor the bonzes and performing charitable deeds. The head of the Wang\nmansion has, it is true, been raised to some office on the frontier, but\nI hope that this lady Secunda will anyhow notice us. How is it then that\nyou don't find your way as far as there; for she may possibly remember\nold times, and some good may, no one can say, come of it? I only wish\nthat she would display some of her kind-heartedness, and pluck one hair\nfrom her person which would be, yea thicker than our waist.\"\n\n\"What you suggest, mother, is quite correct,\" interposed Mrs. Liu, Kou\nErh's wife, who stood by and took up the conversation, \"but with such\nmouth and phiz as yours and mine, how could we present ourselves before\nher door? Why I fear that the man at her gate won't also like to go and\nannounce us! and we'd better not go and have our mouths slapped in\npublic!\"\n\nKou Erh, who would have thought it, prized highly both affluence and\nfame, so that when he heard these remarks, he forthwith began to feel at\nheart a little more at ease. When he furthermore heard what his wife had\nto say, he at once caught up the word as he smiled.\n\n\"Old mother,\" he rejoined; \"since that be your idea, and what's more,\nyou have in days gone by seen this lady on one occasion, why shouldn't\nyou, old lady, start to-morrow on a visit to her and first ascertain how\nthe wind blows!\"\n\n\"Ai Ya!\" exclaimed old Goody, \"It may very well be said that the\nmarquis' door is like the wide ocean! what sort of thing am I? why the\nservants of that family wouldn't even recognise me! even were I to go,\nit would be on a wild goose chase.\"\n\n\"No matter about that,\" observed Kou Erh; \"I'll tell you a good way; you\njust take along with you, your grandson, little Pan Erh, and go first\nand call upon Chou Jui, who is attached to that household; and when once\nyou've seen him, there will be some little chance. This Chou Jui, at one\ntime, was connected with my father in some affair or other, and we were\non excellent terms with him.\"\n\n\"That I too know,\" replied goody Liu, \"but the thing is that you've had\nno dealings with him for so long, that who knows how he's disposed\ntowards us now? this would be hard to say. Besides, you're a man, and\nwith a mouth and phiz like that of yours, you couldn't, on any account,\ngo on this errand. My daughter is a young woman, and she too couldn't\nvery well go and expose herself to public gaze. But by my sacrificing\nthis old face of mine, and by going and knocking it (against the wall)\nthere may, after all, be some benefit and all of us might reap profit.\"\n\nThat very same evening, they laid their plans, and the next morning\nbefore the break of day, old goody Liu speedily got up, and having\nperformed her toilette, she gave a few useful hints to Pan Erh; who,\nbeing a child of five or six years of age, was, when he heard that he\nwas to be taken into the city, at once so delighted that there was\nnothing that he would not agree to.\n\nWithout further delay, goody Liu led off Pan Erh, and entered the city,\nand reaching the Ning Jung street, she came to the main entrance of the\nJung mansion, where, next to the marble lions, were to be seen a crowd\nof chairs and horses. Goody Liu could not however muster the courage to\ngo by, but having shaken her clothes, and said a few more seasonable\nwords to Pan Erh, she subsequently squatted in front of the side gate,\nwhence she could see a number of servants, swelling out their chests,\npushing out their stomachs, gesticulating with their hands and kicking\ntheir feet about, while they were seated at the main entrance chattering\nabout one thing and another.\n\nGoody Liu felt constrained to edge herself forward. \"Gentlemen,\" she\nventured, \"may happiness betide you!\"\n\nThe whole company of servants scrutinised her for a time. \"Where do you\ncome from?\" they at length inquired.\n\n\"I've come to look up Mr. Chou, an attendant of my lady's,\" remarked\ngoody Liu, as she forced a smile; \"which of you, gentlemen, shall I\ntrouble to do me the favour of asking him to come out?\"\n\nThe servants, after hearing what she had to say, paid, the whole number\nof them, no heed to her; and it was after the lapse of a considerable\ntime that they suggested: \"Go and wait at a distance, at the foot of\nthat wall; and in a short while, the visitors, who are in their house,\nwill be coming out.\"\n\nAmong the party of attendants was an old man, who interposed,\n\n\"Don't baffle her object,\" he expostulated; \"why make a fool of her?\"\nand turning to goody Liu: \"This Mr. Chou,\" he said, \"is gone south: his\nhouse is at the back row; his wife is anyhow at home; so go round this\nway, until you reach the door, at the back street, where, if you will\nask about her, you will be on the right track.\"\n\nGoody Liu, having expressed her thanks, forthwith went, leading Pan Erh\nby the hand, round to the back door, where she saw several pedlars\nresting their burdens. There were also those who sold things to eat, and\nthose who sold playthings and toys; and besides these, twenty or thirty\nboys bawled and shouted, making quite a noise.\n\nGoody Liu readily caught hold of one of them. \"I'd like to ask you just\na word, my young friend,\" she observed; \"there's a Mrs. Chou here; is\nshe at home?\"\n\n\"Which Mrs. Chou?\" inquired the boy; \"we here have three Mrs. Chous; and\nthere are also two young married ladies of the name of Chou. What are\nthe duties of the one you want, I wonder ?\"\n\n\"She's a waiting-woman of my lady,\" replied goody Liu.\n\n\"It's easy to get at her,\" added the boy; \"just come along with me.\"\n\nLeading the way for goody Liu into the backyard, they reached the wall\nof a court, when he pointed and said, \"This is her house.--Mother Chou!\"\nhe went on to shout with alacrity; \"there's an old lady who wants to see\nyou.\"\n\nChou Jui's wife was at home, and with all haste she came out to greet\nher visitor. \"Who is it?\" she asked.\n\nGoody Liu advanced up to her. \"How are you,\" she inquired, \"Mrs. Chou?\"\n\nMrs. Chou looked at her for some time before she at length smiled and\nreplied, \"Old goody Liu, are you well? How many years is it since we've\nseen each other; tell me, for I forget just now; but please come in and\nsit.\"\n\n\"You're a lady of rank,\" answered goody Liu smiling, as she walked\nalong, \"and do forget many things. How could you remember such as\nourselves?\"\n\nWith these words still in her mouth, they had entered the house,\nwhereupon Mrs. Chou ordered a hired waiting-maid to pour the tea. While\nthey were having their tea she remarked, \"How Pan Erh has managed to\ngrow!\" and then went on to make inquiries on the subject of various\nmatters, which had occurred after their separation.\n\n\"To-day,\" she also asked of goody Liu, \"were you simply passing by? or\ndid you come with any express object?\"\n\n\"I've come, the fact is, with an object!\" promptly replied goody Liu;\n\"(first of all) to see you, my dear sister-in-law; and, in the second\nplace also, to inquire after my lady's health. If you could introduce me\nto see her for a while, it would be better; but if you can't, I must\nreadily borrow your good offices, my sister-in-law, to convey my\nmessage.\"\n\nMr. Chou Jui's wife, after listening to these words, at once became to a\ngreat extent aware of the object of her visit. Her husband had, however,\nin years gone by in his attempt to purchase some land, obtained\nconsiderably the support of Kou Erh, so that when she, on this occasion,\nsaw goody Liu in such a dilemma, she could not make up her mind to\nrefuse her wish. Being in the second place keen upon making a display of\nher own respectability, she therefore said smilingly:\n\n\"Old goody Liu, pray compose your mind! You've come from far off with a\npure heart and honest purpose, and how can I ever not show you the way\nhow to see this living Buddha? Properly speaking, when people come and\nguests arrive, and verbal messages have to be given, these matters are\nnot any of my business, as we all here have each one kind of duties to\ncarry out. My husband has the special charge of the rents of land coming\nin, during the two seasons of spring and autumn, and when at leisure, he\ntakes the young gentlemen out of doors, and then his business is done.\nAs for myself, I have to accompany my lady and young married ladies on\nanything connected with out-of-doors; but as you are a relative of my\nlady and have besides treated me as a high person and come to me for\nhelp, I'll, after all, break this custom and deliver your message.\nThere's only one thing, however, and which you, old lady, don't know. We\nhere are not what we were five years before. My lady now doesn't much\nworry herself about anything; and it's entirely lady Secunda who looks\nafter the menage. But who do you presume is this lady Secunda? She's the\nniece of my lady, and the daughter of my master, the eldest maternal\nuncle of by-gone days. Her infant name was Feng Ko.\"\n\n\"Is it really she?\" inquired promptly goody Liu, after this explanation.\n\"Isn't it strange? what I said about her years back has come out quite\ncorrect; but from all you say, shall I to-day be able to see her?\"\n\n\"That goes without saying,\" replied Chou Jui's wife; \"when any visitors\ncome now-a-days, it's always lady Feng who does the honours and\nentertains them, and it's better to-day that you should see her for a\nwhile, for then you will not have walked all this way to no purpose.\"\n\n\"O mi to fu!\" exclaimed old goody Liu; \"I leave it entirely to your\nconvenience, sister-in-law.\"\n\n\"What's that you're saying?\" observed Chou Jui's wife. \"The proverb\nsays: 'Our convenience is the convenience of others.' All I have to do\nis to just utter one word, and what trouble will that be to me.\"\n\nSaying this, she bade the young waiting maid go to the side pavilion,\nand quietly ascertain whether, in her old ladyship's apartment, table\nhad been laid.\n\nThe young waiting-maid went on this errand, and during this while, the\ntwo of them continued a conversation on certain irrelevant matters.\n\n\"This lady Feng,\" observed goody Liu, \"can this year be no older than\ntwenty, and yet so talented as to manage such a household as this! the\nlike of her is not easy to find!\"\n\n\"Hai! my dear old goody,\" said Chou Jui's wife, after listening to her,\n\"it's not easy to explain; but this lady Feng, though young in years, is\nnevertheless, in the management of affairs, superior to any man. She has\nnow excelled the others and developed the very features of a beautiful\nyoung woman. To say the least, she has ten thousand eyes in her heart,\nand were they willing to wager their mouths, why ten men gifted with\neloquence couldn't even outdo her! But by and bye, when you've seen her,\nyou'll know all about her! There's only this thing, she can't help being\nrather too severe in her treatment of those below her.\"\n\nWhile yet she spake, the young waiting-maid returned. \"In her venerable\nlady's apartment,\" she reported, \"repast has been spread, and already\nfinished; lady Secunda is in madame Wang's chamber.\"\n\nAs soon as Chou Jui's wife heard this news, she speedily got up and\npressed goody Liu to be off at once. \"This is,\" she urged, \"just the\nhour for her meal, and as she is free we had better first go and wait\nfor her; for were we to be even one step too late, a crowd of servants\nwill come with their reports, and it will then be difficult to speak to\nher; and after her siesta, she'll have still less time to herself.\"\n\nAs she passed these remarks, they all descended the couch together.\nGoody Liu adjusted their dresses, and, having impressed a few more words\nof advice on Pan Erh, they followed Chou Jui's wife through winding\npassages to Chia Lien's house. They came in the first instance into the\nside pavilion, where Chou Jui's wife placed old goody Liu to wait a\nlittle, while she herself went ahead, past the screen-wall and into the\nentrance of the court.\n\nHearing that lady Feng had not come out, she went in search of an\nelderly waiting-maid of lady Feng, P'ing Erh by name, who enjoyed her\nconfidence, to whom Chou Jui's wife first recounted from beginning to\nend the history of old goody Liu.\n\n\"She has come to-day,\" she went on to explain, \"from a distance to pay\nher obeisance. In days gone by, our lady used often to meet her, so\nthat, on this occasion, she can't but receive her; and this is why I've\nbrought her in! I'll wait here for lady Feng to come down, and explain\neverything to her; and I trust she'll not call me to task for officious\nrudeness.\"\n\nP'ing Erh, after hearing what she had to say, speedily devised the plan\nof asking them to walk in, and to sit there pending (lady Feng's\narrival), when all would be right.\n\nChou Jui's wife thereupon went out and led them in. When they ascended\nthe steps of the main apartment, a young waiting-maid raised a red\nwoollen porti\u00c3\u00a8re, and as soon as they entered the hall, they smelt a\nwhiff of perfume as it came wafted into their faces: what the scent was\nthey could not discriminate; but their persons felt as if they were\namong the clouds.\n\nThe articles of furniture and ornaments in the whole room were all so\nbrilliant to the sight, and so vying in splendour that they made the\nhead to swim and the eyes to blink, and old goody Liu did nothing else\nthe while than nod her head, smack her lips and invoke Buddha. Forthwith\nshe was led to the eastern side into the suite of apartments, where was\nthe bedroom of Chia Lien's eldest daughter. P'ing Erh, who was standing\nby the edge of the stove-couch, cast a couple of glances at old goody\nLiu, and felt constrained to inquire how she was, and to press her to\nhave a seat.\n\nGoody Liu, noticing that P'ing Erh was entirely robed in silks, that she\nhad gold pins fixed in her hair, and silver ornaments in her coiffure,\nand that her countenance resembled a flower or the moon (in beauty),\nreadily imagined her to be lady Feng, and was about to address her as my\nlady; but when she heard Mrs. Chou speak to her as Miss P'ing, and P'ing\nErh promptly address Chou Jui's wife as Mrs. Chou, she eventually became\naware that she could be no more than a waiting-maid of a certain\nrespectability.\n\nShe at once pressed old goody Liu and Pan Erh to take a seat on the\nstove-couch. P'ing Erh and Chou Jui's wife sat face to face, on the\nedges of the couch. The waiting-maids brought the tea. After they had\npartaken of it, old goody Liu could hear nothing but a \"lo tang, lo\ntang\" noise, resembling very much the sound of a bolting frame winnowing\nflour, and she could not resist looking now to the East, and now to the\nWest. Suddenly in the great Hall, she espied, suspended on a pillar, a\nbox at the bottom of which hung something like the weight of a balance,\nwhich incessantly wagged to and fro.\n\n\"What can this thing be?\" communed goody Liu in her heart, \"What can be\nits use?\" While she was aghast, she unexpectedly heard a sound of \"tang\"\nlike the sound of a golden bell or copper cymbal, which gave her quite a\nstart. In a twinkle of the eyes followed eight or nine consecutive\nstrokes; and she was bent upon inquiring what it was, when she caught\nsight of several waiting-maids enter in a confused crowd. \"Our lady has\ncome down!\" they announced.\n\nP'\u00c3\u00acng Erh, together with Chou Jui's wife, rose with all haste. \"Old\ngoody Liu,\" they urged, \"do sit down and wait till it's time, when we'll\ncome and ask you in.\"\n\nSaying this, they went out to meet lady Feng.\n\nOld goody Liu, with suppressed voice and ear intent, waited in perfect\nsilence. She heard at a distance the voices of some people laughing,\nwhereupon about ten or twenty women, with rustling clothes and\npetticoats, made their entrance, one by one, into the hall, and thence\ninto the room on the other quarter. She also detected two or three\nwomen, with red-lacquered boxes in their hands, come over on this part\nand remain in waiting.\n\n\"Get the repast ready!\" she heard some one from the offside say.\n\nThe servants gradually dispersed and went out; and there only remained\nin attendance a few of them to bring in the courses. For a long time,\nnot so much as the caw of a crow could be heard, when she unexpectedly\nperceived two servants carry in a couch-table, and lay it on this side\nof the divan. Upon this table were placed bowls and plates, in proper\norder replete, as usual, with fish and meats; but of these only a few\nkinds were slightly touched.\n\nAs soon as Pan Erh perceived (all these delicacies), he set up such a\nnoise, and would have some meat to eat, but goody Liu administered to\nhim such a slap, that he had to keep away.\n\nSuddenly, she saw Mrs. Chou approach, full of smiles, and as she waved\nher hand, she called her. Goody Liu understood her meaning, and at once\npulling Pan Erh off the couch, she proceeded to the centre of the Hall;\nand after Mrs. Chou had whispered to her again for a while, they came at\nlength with slow step into the room on this side, where they saw on the\noutside of the door, suspended by brass hooks, a deep red flowered soft\nporti\u00c3\u00a8re. Below the window, on the southern side, was a stove-couch, and\non this couch was spread a crimson carpet. Leaning against the wooden\npartition wall, on the east side, stood a chain-embroidered back-cushion\nand a reclining pillow. There was also spread a large watered satin\nsitting cushion with a gold embroidered centre, and on the side stood\ncuspidores made of silver.\n\nLady Feng, when at home, usually wore on her head a front-piece of dark\nmartin \u00c3\u00a0 la Chao Ch\u00c3\u00bcn, surrounded with tassels of strung pearls. She had\non a robe of peach-red flowered satin, a short pelisse of slate-blue\nstiff silk, lined with squirrel, and a jupe of deep red foreign crepe,\nlined with ermine. Resplendent with pearl-powder and with cosmetics, she\nsat in there, stately and majestic, with a small brass poker in her\nhands, with which she was stirring the ashes of the hand-stove. P'ing\nErh stood by the side of the couch, holding a very small lacquered\ntea-tray. In this tray was a small tea-cup with a cover. Lady Feng\nneither took any tea, nor did she raise her head, but was intent upon\nstirring the ashes of the hand-stove.\n\n\"How is it you haven't yet asked her to come in?\" she slowly inquired;\nand as she spake, she turned herself round and was about to ask for some\ntea, when she perceived that Mrs. Chou had already introduced the two\npersons and that they were standing in front of her.\n\nShe forthwith pretended to rise, but did not actually get up, and with a\nface radiant with smiles, she ascertained about their health, after\nwhich she went in to chide Chou Jui's wife. \"Why didn't you tell me they\nhad come before?\" she said.\n\nOld goody Liu was already by this time prostrated on the ground, and\nafter making several obeisances, \"How are you, my lady?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Dear Mrs. Chou,\" lady Feng immediately observed, \"do pull her up, and\ndon't let her prostrate herself! I'm yet young in years and don't know\nher much; what's more, I've no idea what's the degree of the\nrelationship between us, and I daren't speak directly to her.\"\n\n\"This is the old lady about whom I spoke a short while back,\" speedily\nexplained Mrs. Chou.\n\nLady Feng nodded her head assentingly.\n\nBy this time old goody Liu had taken a seat on the edge of the\nstove-couch. As for Pan Erh, he had gone further, and taken refuge\nbehind her back; and though she tried, by every means, to coax him to\ncome forward and make a bow, he would not, for the life of him, consent.\n\n\"Relatives though we be,\" remarked lady Feng, as she smiled, \"we haven't\nseen much of each other, so that our relations have been quite distant.\nBut those who know how matters stand will assert that you all despise\nus, and won't often come to look us up; while those mean people, who\ndon't know the truth, will imagine that we have no eyes to look at any\none.\"\n\nOld goody Liu promptly invoked Buddha. \"We are at home in great\nstraits,\" she pleaded, \"and that's why it wasn't easy for us to manage\nto get away and come! Even supposing we had come as far as this, had we\nnot given your ladyship a slap on the mouth, those gentlemen would also,\nin point of fact, have looked down upon us as a mean lot.\"\n\n\"Why, language such as this,\" exclaimed lady Feng smilingly, \"cannot\nhelp making one's heart full of displeasure! We simply rely upon the\nreputation of our grandfather to maintain the status of a penniless\nofficial; that's all! Why, in whose household is there anything\nsubstantial? we are merely the denuded skeleton of what we were in days\nof old, and no more! As the proverb has it: The Emperor himself has\nthree families of poverty-stricken relatives; and how much more such as\nyou and I?\"\n\nHaving passed these remarks, she inquired of Mrs. Chou, \"Have you let\nmadame know, yes or no?\"\n\n\"We are now waiting,\" replied Mrs. Chou, \"for my lady's orders.\"\n\n\"Go and have a look,\" said lady Feng; \"but, should there be any one\nthere, or should she be busy, then don't make any mention; but wait\nuntil she's free, when you can tell her about it and see what she says.\"\n\nChou Jui's wife, having expressed her compliance, went off on this\nerrand. During her absence, lady Feng gave orders to some servants to\ntake a few fruits and hand them to Pan Erh to eat; and she was inquiring\nabout one thing and another, when there came a large number of married\nwomen, who had the direction of affairs in the household, to make their\nseveral reports.\n\nP'ing Erh announced their arrival to lady Feng, who said: \"I'm now\nengaged in entertaining some guests, so let them come back again in the\nevening; but should there be anything pressing then bring it in and I'll\nsettle it at once.\"\n\nP'ing Erh left the room, but she returned in a short while. \"I've asked\nthem,\" she observed, \"but as there's nothing of any urgency, I told them\nto disperse.\" Lady Feng nodded her head in token of approval, when she\nperceived Chou Jui's wife come back. \"Our lady,\" she reported, as she\naddressed lady Feng, \"says that she has no leisure to-day, that if you,\nlady Secunda, will entertain them, it will come to the same thing; that\nshe's much obliged for their kind attention in going to the trouble of\ncoming; that if they have come simply on a stroll, then well and good,\nbut that if they have aught to say, they should tell you, lady Secunda,\nwhich will be tantamount to their telling her.\"\n\n\"I've nothing to say,\" interposed old goody Liu. \"I simply come to see\nour elder and our younger lady, which is a duty on my part, a relative\nas I am.\"\n\n\"Well, if there's nothing particular that you've got to say, all right,\"\nMrs. Chou forthwith added, \"but if you do have anything, don't hesitate\ntelling lady Secunda, and it will be just as if you had told our lady.\"\n\nAs she uttered these words, she winked at goody Liu. Goody Liu\nunderstood what she meant, but before she could give vent to a word, her\nface got scarlet, and though she would have liked not to make any\nmention of the object of her visit, she felt constrained to suppress her\nshame and to speak out.\n\n\"Properly speaking,\" she observed, \"this being the first time I see you,\nmy lady, I shouldn't mention what I've to say, but as I come here from\nfar off to seek your assistance, my old friend, I have no help but to\nmention it.\"\n\nShe had barely spoken as much as this, when she heard the youths at the\ninner-door cry out: \"The young gentleman from the Eastern Mansion has\ncome.\"\n\nLady Feng promptly interrupted her. \"Old goody Liu,\" she remarked, \"you\nneedn't add anything more.\" She, at the same time, inquired, \"Where's\nyour master, Mr. Jung?\" when became audible the sound of footsteps along\nthe way, and in walked a young man of seventeen or eighteen. His\nappearance was handsome, his person slender and graceful. He had on\nlight furs, a girdle of value, costly clothes and a beautiful cap.\n\nAt this stage, goody Liu did not know whether it was best to sit down or\nto stand up, neither could she find anywhere to hide herself.\n\n\"Pray sit down,\" urged lady Feng, with a laugh; \"this is my nephew!' Old\ngoody Liu then wriggled herself, now one way, and then another, on to\nthe edge of the couch, where she took a seat.\n\n\"My father,\" Chia Jung smilingly ventured, \"has sent me to ask a favour\nof you, aunt. On some previous occasion, our grand aunt gave you, dear\naunt, a stove-couch glass screen, and as to-morrow father has invited\nsome guests of high standing, he wishes to borrow it to lay it out for a\nlittle show; after which he purposes sending it back again.\"\n\n\"You're late by a day,\" replied lady Feng. \"It was only yesterday that I\ngave it to some one.\"\n\nChia Jung, upon hearing this, forthwith, with giggles and smiles, made,\nnear the edge of the couch, a sort of genuflexion. \"Aunt,\" he went on,\n\"if you don't lend it, father will again say that I don't know how to\nspeak, and I shall get another sound thrashing. You must have pity upon\nyour nephew, aunt.\"\n\n\"I've never seen anything like this,\" observed lady Feng sneeringly;\n\"the things belonging to the Wang family are all good, but where have\nyou put all those things of yours? the only good way is that you\nshouldn't see anything of ours, for as soon as you catch sight of\nanything, you at once entertain a wish to carry it off.\"\n\n\"Pray, aunt,\" entreated Chia Jung with a smile, \"do show me some\ncompassion.\"\n\n\"Mind your skin!\" lady Feng warned him, \"if you do chip or spoil it in\nthe least.\"\n\nShe then bade P'ing Erh take the keys of the door of the upstairs room\nand send for several trustworthy persons to carry it away.\n\nChia Jung was so elated that his eyebrows dilated and his eyes smiled.\n\"I've brought myself,\" he added, with vehemence, \"some men to take it\naway; I won't let them recklessly bump it about.\"\n\nSaying this, he speedily got up and left the room.\n\nLady Feng suddenly bethought herself of something, and turning towards\nthe window, she called out, \"Jung Erh, come back.\" Several servants who\nstood outside caught up her words: \"Mr. Jung,\" they cried, \"you're\nrequested to go back;\" whereupon Chia Jung turned round and retraced his\nsteps; and with hands drooping respectfully against his sides, he stood\nready to listen to his aunt's wishes.\n\nLady Feng was however intent upon gently sipping her tea, and after a\ngood long while of abstraction, she at last smiled: \"Never mind,\" she\nremarked; \"you can go. But come after you've had your evening meal, and\nI'll then tell you about it. Just now there are visitors here; and\nbesides, I don't feel in the humour.\"\n\nChia Jung thereupon retired with gentle step.\n\nOld goody Liu, by this time, felt more composed in body and heart. \"I've\nto-day brought your nephew,\" she then explained, \"not for anything else,\nbut because his father and mother haven't at home so much as anything to\neat; the weather besides is already cold, so that I had no help but to\ntake your nephew along and come to you, old friend, for assistance!\"\n\nAs she uttered these words, she again pushed Pan Erh forward. \"What did\nyour father at home tell you to say?\" she asked of him; \"and what did he\nsend us over here to do? Was it only to give our minds to eating fruit?\"\n\nLady Feng had long ago understood what she meant to convey, and finding\nthat she had no idea how to express herself in a decent manner, she\nreadily interrupted her with a smile. \"You needn't mention anything,\"\nshe observed, \"I'm well aware of how things stand;\" and addressing\nherself to Mrs. Chou, she inquired, \"Has this old lady had breakfast,\nyes or no?\"\n\nOld goody Liu hurried to explain. \"As soon as it was daylight,\" she\nproceeded, \"we started with all speed on our way here, and had we even\nso much as time to have any breakfast?\"\n\nLady Feng promptly gave orders to send for something to eat. In a short\nwhile Chou Jui's wife had called for a table of viands for the guests,\nwhich was laid in the room on the eastern side, and then came to take\ngoody Liu and Pan Erh over to have their repast.\n\n\"My dear Mrs. Chou,\" enjoined lady Feng, \"give them all they want, as I\ncan't attend to them myself;\" which said, they hastily passed over into\nthe room on the eastern side.\n\nLady Feng having again called Mrs. Chou, asked her: \"When you first\ninformed madame about them, what did she say?\" \"Our Lady observed,\"\nreplied Chou Jui's wife, \"that they don't really belong to the same\nfamily; that, in former years, their grandfather was an official at the\nsame place as our old master; that hence it came that they joined\nancestors; that these few years there hasn't been much intercourse\n(between their family and ours); that some years back, whenever they\ncame on a visit, they were never permitted to go empty-handed, and that\nas their coming on this occasion to see us is also a kind attention on\ntheir part, they shouldn't be slighted. If they've anything to say,\"\n(our lady continued), \"tell lady Secunda to do the necessary, and that\nwill be right.\"\n\n\"Isn't it strange!\" exclaimed lady Feng, as soon as she had heard the\nmessage; \"since we are all one family, how is it I'm not familiar even\nwith so much as their shadow?\"\n\nWhile she was uttering these words, old goody Liu had had her repast and\ncome over, dragging Pan Erh; and, licking her lips and smacking her\nmouth, she expressed her thanks.\n\nLady Feng smiled. \"Do pray sit down,\" she said, \"and listen to what I'm\ngoing to tell you. What you, old lady, meant a little while back to\nconvey, I'm already as much as yourself well acquainted with! Relatives,\nas we are, we shouldn't in fact have waited until you came to the\nthreshold of our doors, but ought, as is but right, to have attended to\nyour needs. But the thing is that, of late, the household affairs are\nexceedingly numerous, and our lady, advanced in years as she is,\ncouldn't at a moment, it may possibly be, bethink herself of you all!\nWhat's more, when I took over charge of the management of the menage, I\nmyself didn't know of all these family connections! Besides, though to\nlook at us from outside everything has a grand and splendid aspect,\npeople aren't aware that large establishments have such great hardships,\nwhich, were we to recount to others, they would hardly like to credit as\ntrue. But since you've now come from a great distance, and this is the\nfirst occasion that you open your mouth to address me, how can I very\nwell allow you to return to your home with empty hands! By a lucky\ncoincidence our lady gave, yesterday, to the waiting-maids, twenty taels\nto make clothes with, a sum which they haven't as yet touched, and if\nyou don't despise it as too little, you may take it home as a first\ninstalment, and employ it for your wants.\"\n\nWhen old goody Liu heard the mention made by lady Feng of their\nhardships, she imagined that there was no hope; but upon hearing her\nagain speak of giving her twenty taels, she was exceedingly delighted,\nso much so that her eyebrows dilated and her eyes gleamed with smiles.\n\n\"We too know,\" she smilingly remarked, \"all about difficulties! but the\nproverb says, 'A camel dying of leanness is even bigger by much than a\nhorse!' No matter what those distresses may be, were you yet to pluck\none single hair from your body, my old friend, it would be stouter than\nour own waist.\"\n\nChou Jui's wife stood by, and on hearing her make these coarse\nutterances, she did all she could to give her a hint by winking, and\nmake her desist. Lady Feng laughed and paid no heed; but calling P'ing\nErh, she bade her fetch the parcel of money, which had been given to\nthem the previous day, and to also bring a string of cash; and when\nthese had been placed before goody Liu's eyes: \"This is,\" said lady\nFeng, \"silver to the amount of twenty taels, which was for the time\ngiven to these young girls to make winter clothes with; but some other\nday, when you've nothing to do, come again on a stroll, in evidence of\nthe good feeling which should exist between relatives. It's besides\nalready late, and I don't wish to detain you longer and all for no\npurpose; but, on your return home, present my compliments to all those\nof yours to whom I should send them.\"\n\nAs she spake, she stood up. Old goody Liu gave utterance to a thousand\nand ten thousand expressions of gratitude, and taking the silver and\ncash, she followed Chou Jui's wife on her way to the out-houses. \"Well,\nmother dear,\" inquired Mrs. Chou, \"what did you think of my lady that\nyou couldn't speak; and that whenever you opened your mouth it was all\n'your nephew.' I'll make just one remark, and I don't mind if you do get\nangry. Had he even been your kindred nephew, you should in fact have\nbeen somewhat milder in your language; for that gentleman, Mr. Jung, is\nher kith and kin nephew, and whence has appeared such another nephew of\nhers (as Pan Erh)?\"\n\nOld goody Liu smiled. \"My dear sister-in-law,\" she replied, \"as I gazed\nupon her, were my heart and eyes, pray, full of admiration or not? and\nhow then could I speak as I should?\"\n\nAs they were chatting, they reached Chou Jui's house. They had been\nsitting for a while, when old goody Liu produced a piece of silver,\nwhich she was purposing to leave behind, to be given to the young\nservants in Chou Jui's house to purchase fruit to eat; but how could\nMrs. Chou satiate her eye with such a small piece of silver? She was\ndetermined in her refusal to accept it, so that old goody Liu, after\nassuring her of her boundless gratitude, took her departure out of the\nback gate she had come in from.\n\nReader, you do not know what happened after old goody Liu left, but\nlisten to the explanation which will be given in the next chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n  Presentation of artificial flowers made in the Palace.\n  Chia Lien disports himself with Hsi-feng.\n  Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc meets Ch'in Chung at a family party.\n\n\nTo resume our narrative. Chou Jui's wife having seen old goody Liu off,\nspeedily came to report the visit to madame Wang; but, contrary to her\nexpectation, she did not find madame Wang in the drawing-room; and it\nwas after inquiring of the waiting-maids that she eventually learnt that\nshe had just gone over to have a chat with \"aunt\" Hs\u00c3\u00bceh. Mrs. Chou, upon\nhearing this, hastily went out by the eastern corner door, and through\nthe yard on the east, into the Pear Fragrance Court.\n\nAs soon as she reached the entrance, she caught sight of madame Wang's\nwaiting-maid, Chin Ch'uan-erh, playing about on the terrace steps, with\na young girl, who had just let her hair grow. When they saw Chou Jui's\nwife approach, they forthwith surmised that she must have some message\nto deliver, so they pursed up their lips and directed her to the\ninner-room. Chou Jui's wife gently raised the curtain-screen, and upon\nentering discovered madame Wang, in voluble conversation with \"aunt\"\nHs\u00c3\u00bceh, about family questions and people in general.\n\nMrs. Chou did not venture to disturb them, and accordingly came into the\ninner room, where she found Hs\u00c3\u00bceh Pao-ch'ai in a house dress, with her\nhair simply twisted into a knot round the top of the head, sitting on\nthe inner edge of the stove-couch, leaning on a small divan table, in\nthe act of copying a pattern for embroidery, with the waiting-maid Ying\nErh. When she saw her enter, Pao Ch'ai hastily put down her pencil, and\nturning round with a face beaming with smiles, \"Sister Chou,\" she said,\n\"take a seat.\"\n\nChou Jui's wife likewise promptly returned the smile.\n\n\"How is my young lady?\" she inquired, as she sat down on the edge of the\ncouch. \"I haven't seen you come over on the other side for two or three\ndays! Has Mr. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc perhaps given you offence?\"\n\n\"What an idea!\" exclaimed Pao Ch'ai, with a smile. \"It's simply that\nI've had for the last couple of days my old complaint again, and that\nI've in consequence kept quiet all this time, and looked after myself.\"\n\n\"Is that it?\" asked Chou Jui's wife; \"but after all, what rooted kind of\ncomplaint are you subject to, miss? you should lose really no time in\nsending for a doctor to diagnose it, and give you something to make you\nall right. With your tender years, to have an organic ailment is indeed\nno trifle!\"\n\nPao Ch'ai laughed when she heard these remarks.\n\n\"Pray,\" she said, \"don't allude to this again; for this ailment of mine\nI've seen, I can't tell you, how many doctors; taken no end of medicine\nand spent I don't know how much money; but the more we did so, not the\nleast little bit of relief did I see. Lucky enough, we eventually came\nacross a bald-pated bonze, whose speciality was the cure of nameless\nillnesses. We therefore sent for him to see me, and he said that I had\nbrought this along with me from the womb as a sort of inflammatory\nvirus, that luckily I had a constitution strong and hale so that it\ndidn't matter; and that it would be of no avail if I took pills or any\nmedicines. He then told me a prescription from abroad, and gave me also\na packet of a certain powder as a preparative, with a peculiar smell and\nstrange flavour. He advised me, whenever my complaint broke out, to take\na pill, which would be sure to put me right again. And this has, after\nall, strange to say, done me a great deal of good.\"\n\n\"What kind of prescription is this one from abroad, I wonder,\" remarked\nMrs. Chou; \"if you, miss, would only tell me, it would be worth our\nwhile bearing it in mind, and recommending it to others: and if ever we\ncame across any one afflicted with this disease, we would also be doing\na charitable deed.\"\n\n\"You'd better not ask for the prescription,\" rejoined Pao Ch'ai smiling.\n\"Why, its enough to wear one out with perplexity! the necessaries and\ningredients are few, and all easy to get, but it would be difficult to\nfind the lucky moment! You want twelve ounces of the pollen of the white\npeone, which flowers in spring, twelve ounces of the pollen of the white\nsummer lily, twelve ounces of the pollen of the autumn hibiscus flower,\nand twelve ounces of the white plum in bloom in the winter. You take the\nfour kinds of pollen, and put them in the sun, on the very day of the\nvernal equinox of the succeeding year to get dry, and then you mix them\nwith the powder and pound them well together. You again want twelve mace\nof water, fallen on 'rain water' day.....\"\n\n\"Good gracious!\" exclaimed Mrs. Chou promptly, as she laughed. \"From all\nyou say, why you want three years' time! and what if no rain falls on\n'rain water' day! What would one then do?\"\n\n\"Quite so!\" Pao Ch'ai remarked smilingly; \"how can there be such an\nopportune rain on that very day! but to wait is also the best thing,\nthere's nothing else to be done. Besides, you want twelve mace of dew,\ncollected on 'White Dew' day, and twelve mace of the hoar frost,\ngathered on 'Frost Descent' day, and twelve mace of snow, fallen on\n'Slight Snow' day! You next take these four kinds of waters and mix them\nwith the other ingredients, and make pills of the size of a lungngan.\nYou keep them in an old porcelain jar, and bury them under the roots of\nsome flowers; and when the ailment betrays itself, you produce it and\ntake a pill, washing it down with two candareens of a yellow cedar\ndecoction.\"\n\n\"O-mi-to-fu!\" cried Mrs. Chou, when she heard all this, bursting out\nlaughing. \"It's really enough to kill one! you might wait ten years and\nfind no such lucky moments!\"\n\n\"Fortunate for me, however,\" pursued Pao Ch'ai, \"in the course of a year\nor two, after the bonze had told me about this prescription, we got all\nthe ingredients; and, after much trouble, we compounded a supply, which\nwe have now brought along with us from the south to the north; and lies\nat present under the pear trees.\"\n\n\"Has this medicine any name or other of its own?\" further inquired Mrs.\nChou.\n\n\"It has a name,\" replied Pao Ch'ai; \"the mangy-headed bonze also told it\nme; he called it 'cold fragrance' pill.\"\n\nChou Jui's wife nodded her head, as she heard these words. \"What do you\nfeel like after all when this complaint manifests itself?\" she went on\nto ask.\n\n\"Nothing much,\" replied Pao Ch'ai; \"I simply pant and cough a bit; but\nafter I've taken a pill, I get over it, and it's all gone.\"\n\nMrs. Chou was bent upon making some further remark, when madame Wang was\nsuddenly heard to enquire, \"Who is in here?\"\n\nMrs. Chou went out hurriedly and answered; and forthwith told her all\nabout old goody Liu's visit. Having waited for a while, and seeing that\nmadame Wang had nothing to say, she was on the point of retiring, when\n\"aunt\" Hsueh unexpectedly remarked smiling: \"Wait a bit! I've something\nto give you to take along with you.\"\n\nAnd as she spoke, she called for Hsiang Ling. The sound of the\nscreen-board against the sides of the door was heard, and in walked the\nwaiting-maid, who had been playing with Chin Ch'uan-erh. \"Did my lady\ncall?\" she asked.\n\n\"Bring that box of flowers,\" said Mrs. Hsueh.\n\nHsiang Ling assented, and brought from the other side a small\nembroidered silk box.\n\n\"These,\" explained \"aunt\" Hs\u00c3\u00bceh, \"are a new kind of flowers, made in the\npalace. They consist of twelve twigs of flowers of piled gauze. I\nthought of them yesterday, and as they will, the pity is, only get old,\nif uselessly put away, why not give them to the girls to wear them in\ntheir hair! I meant to have sent them over yesterday, but I forgot all\nabout them. You come to-day most opportunely, and if you will take them\nwith you, I shall have got them off my hands. To the three young ladies\nin your family give two twigs each, and of the six that will remain give\na couple to Miss Lin, and the other four to lady Feng.\"\n\n\"Better keep them and give them to your daughter Pao Ch'ai to wear,\"\nobserved madame Wang, \"and have done with it; why think of all the\nothers?\"\n\n\"You don't know, sister,\" replied \"aunt\" Hs\u00c3\u00bceh, \"what a crotchety thing\nPao Ch'ai is! she has no liking for flower or powder.\"\n\nWith these words on her lips, Chou Jui's wife took the box and walked\nout of the door of the room. Perceiving that Chin Ch'uan-erh was still\nsunning herself outside, Chou Jui's wife asked her: \"Isn't this Hsiang\nLing, the waiting-maid that we've often heard of as having been\npurchased just before the departure of the Hs\u00c3\u00bceh family for the capital,\nand on whose account there occurred some case of manslaughter or other?\"\n\n\"Of course it's she,\" replied Chin Ch'uan. But as they were talking,\nthey saw Hsiang Ling draw near smirkingly, and Chou Jui's wife at once\nseized her by the hand, and after minutely scrutinizing her face for a\ntime, she turned round to Chin Ch'uan-erh and smiled. \"With these\nfeatures she really resembles slightly the style of lady Jung of our\nEastern Mansion.\"\n\n\"So I too maintain!\" said Chin Ch'uan-erh.\n\nChou Jui's wife then asked Hsiang Ling, \"At what age did you enter this\nfamily? and where are your father and mother at present?\" and also\ninquired, \"In what year of your teens are you? and of what place are you\na native?\"\n\nBut Hsiang Ling, after listening to all these questions, simply nodded\nher head and replied, \"I can't remember.\"\n\nWhen Mrs. Chou and Chin Ch'uan-erh heard these words, their spirits\nchanged to grief, and for a while they felt affected and wounded at\nheart; but in a short time, Mrs. Chou brought the flowers into the room\nat the back of madame Wang's principal apartment.\n\nThe fact is that dowager lady Chia had explained that as her\ngranddaughters were too numerous, it would not be convenient to crowd\nthem together in one place, that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc and Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc should only remain\nwith her in this part to break her loneliness, but that Ying Ch'un, T'an\nCh'un, and Hsi Ch'un, the three of them, should move on this side in the\nthree rooms within the antechamber, at the back of madame lady Wang's\nquarters; and that Li Wan should be told off to be their attendant and\nto keep an eye over them.\n\nChou Jui's wife, therefore, on this occasion came first to these rooms\nas they were on her way, but she only found a few waiting-maids\nassembled in the antechamber, waiting silently to obey a call.\n\nYing Ch'un's waiting-maid, Ssu Chi, together with Shih Shu, T'an Ch'un's\nwaiting-maid, just at this moment raised the curtain, and made their\negress, each holding in her hand a tea-cup and saucer; and Chou Jui's\nwife readily concluding that the young ladies were sitting together also\nwalked into the inner room, where she only saw Ying Ch'un and T'an Ch'un\nseated near the window, in the act of playing chess. Mrs. Chou presented\nthe flowers and explained whence they came, and what they were.\n\nThe girls forthwith interrupted their game, and both with a curtsey,\nexpressed their thanks, and directed the waiting-maids to put the\nflowers away.\n\nMrs. Chou complied with their wishes (and handing over the flowers);\n\"Miss Hsi Ch'un,\" she remarked, \"is not at home; and possibly she's over\nthere with our old lady.\"\n\n\"She's in that room, isn't she?\" inquired the waiting-maids.\n\nMrs. Chou at these words readily came into the room on this side, where\nshe found Hsi Ch'un, in company with a certain Chih Neng, a young nun of\nthe \"moon reflected on water\" convent, talking and laughing together. On\nseeing Chou Jui's wife enter, Hsi Ch'un at once asked what she wanted,\nwhereupon Chou Jui's wife opened the box of flowers, and explained who\nhad sent them.\n\n\"I was just telling Chih Neng,\" remarked Hsi Ch'un laughing, \"that I\nalso purpose shortly shaving my head and becoming a nun; and strange\nenough, here you again bring me flowers; but supposing I shave my head,\nwhere can I wear them?\"\n\nThey were all very much amused for a time with this remark, and Hsi\nCh'un told her waiting-maid, Ju Hua, to come and take over the flowers.\n\n\"What time did you come over?\" then inquired Mrs. Chou of Chih Neng.\n\"Where is that bald-pated and crotchety superior of yours gone?\"\n\n\"We came,\" explained Chih Neng, \"as soon as it was day; after calling\nupon madame Wang, my superior went over to pay a visit in the mansion of\nMr. Y\u00c3\u00bc, and told me to wait for her here.\"\n\n\"Have you received,\" further asked Mrs. Chou, \"the monthly allowance for\nincense offering due on the fifteenth or not?\"\n\n\"I can't say,\" replied Chih Neng.\n\n\"Who's now in charge of the issue of the monthly allowances to the\nvarious temples?\" interposed Hsi Ch'un, addressing Mrs. Chou, as soon as\nshe heard what was said.\n\n\"It's Y\u00c3\u00bc Hsin,\" replied Chou Jui's wife, \"who's intrusted with the\ncharge.\"\n\n\"That's how it is,\" observed Hsi Ch'un with a chuckle; \"soon after the\narrival of the Superior, Y\u00c3\u00bc Hsin's wife came over and kept on whispering\nwith her for some time; so I presume it must have been about this\nallowance.\"\n\nMrs. Chou then went on to bandy a few words with Chih Neng, after which\nshe came over to lady Feng's apartments. Proceeding by a narrow passage,\nshe passed under Li Wan's back windows, and went along the wall\nornamented with creepers on the west. Going out of the western side\ngate, she entered lady Feng's court, and walked over into the Entrance\nHall, where she only found the waiting-girl Feng Erh, sitting on the\ndoorsteps of lady Feng's apartments.\n\nWhen she caught sight of Mrs. Chou approaching, she at once waved her\nhand, bidding her go to the eastern room. Chou Jui's wife understood her\nmeaning, and hastily came on tiptoe to the chamber on the east, where\nshe saw a nurse patting lady Feng's daughter to sleep.\n\nMrs. Chou promptly asked the nurse in a low tone of voice: \"Is the young\nlady asleep at this early hour? But if even she is I must wake her up.\"\n\nThe nurse nodded her head in assent, but as these inquiries were being\nmade, a sound of laughter came from over the other side, in which lady\nFeng's voice could be detected; followed, shortly after, by the sound of\na door opening, and out came P'ing Erh, with a large brass basin in her\nhands, which she told Feng Erh to fill with water and take inside.\n\nP'ing Erh forthwith entered the room on this side, and upon perceiving\nChou Jui's wife: \"What have you come here again for, my old lady?\" she\nreadily inquired.\n\nChou Jui's wife rose without any delay, and handed her the box. \"I've\ncome,\" said she, \"to bring you a present of flowers.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, P'ing Erh opened the box, and took out four sprigs,\nand, turning round, walked out of the room. In a short while she came\nfrom the inner room with two sprigs in her hand, and calling first of\nall Ts'ai Ming, she bade her take the flowers over to the mansion on the\nother side and present them to \"madame\" Jung, after which she asked Mrs.\nChou to express her thanks on her return.\n\nChou Jui's wife thereupon came over to dowager lady Chia's room on this\nside of the compound, and as she was going through the Entrance Hall,\nshe casually came, face to face, with her daughter, got up in gala\ndress, just coming from the house of her mother-in-law.\n\n\"What are you running over here for at this time?\" promptly inquired\nMrs. Chou.\n\n\"Have you been well of late, mother?\" asked her daughter. \"I've been\nwaiting for ever so long at home, but you never come out! What's there\nso pressing that has prevented you from returning home? I waited till I\nwas tired, and then went on all alone, and paid my respects to our\nvenerable lady; I'm now, on my way to inquire about our lady Wang. What\nerrand haven't you delivered as yet, ma; and what is it you're holding?\"\n\n\"Ai! as luck would have it,\" rejoined Chou Jui's wife smilingly, \"old\ngoody Liu came over to-day, so that besides my own hundred and one\nduties, I've had to run about here and there ever so long, and all for\nher! While attending to these, Mrs. Hsueh came across me, and asked me\nto take these flowers to the young ladies, and I've been at it up to\nthis very moment, and haven't done yet! But coming at this time, you\nmust surely have something or other that you want me to do for you!\nwhat's it?\"\n\n\"Really ma, you're quick at guessing!\" exclaimed her daughter with a\nsmile; \"I'll tell you what it's all about. The day before yesterday,\nyour son-in-law had a glass of wine too many, and began altercating with\nsome person or other; and some one, I don't know why, spread some evil\nreport, saying that his antecedents were not clear, and lodged a charge\nagainst him at the Yamen, pressing the authorities to deport him to his\nnative place. That's why I've come over to consult with you, as to whom\nwe should appeal to, to do us this favour of helping us out of our\ndilemma!\"\n\n\"I knew at once,\" Mrs. Chou remarked after listening, \"that there was\nsomething wrong; but this is nothing hard to settle! Go home and wait\nfor me and I'll come straightway, as soon as I've taken these flowers to\nMiss Lin; our madame Wang and lady Secunda have both no leisure (to\nattend to you now,) so go back and wait for me! What's the use of so\nmuch hurry!\"\n\nHer daughter, upon hearing this, forthwith turned round to go back, when\nshe added as she walked away, \"Mind, mother, and make haste.\"\n\n\"All right,\" replied Chou Jui's wife, \"of course I will; you are young\nyet, and without experience, and that's why you are in this flurry.\"\n\nAs she spoke, she betook herself into Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc's apartments. Contrary to\nher expectation Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc was not at this time in her own room, but in\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc's; where they were amusing themselves in trying to solve the\n\"nine strung rings\" puzzle. On entering Mrs. Chou put on a smile.\n\"'Aunt' Hs\u00c3\u00bceh,\" she explained, \"has told me to bring these flowers and\npresent them to you to wear in your hair.\"\n\n\"What flowers?\" exclaimed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. \"Bring them here and let me see them.\"\n\nAs he uttered these words, he readily stretched out his hands and took\nthem over, and upon opening the box and looking in, he discovered, in\nfact, two twigs of a novel and artistic kind of artificial flowers, of\npiled gauze, made in the palace.\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc merely cast a glance at them, as Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc held them. \"Have these\nflowers,\" she inquired eagerly, \"been sent to me alone, or have all the\nother girls got some too?\"\n\n\"Each one of the young ladies has the same,\" replied Mrs. Chou; \"and\nthese two twigs are intended for you, miss.\"\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc forced a smile. \"Oh! I see,\" she observed. \"If all the others\nhadn't chosen, even these which remain over wouldn't have been given to\nme.\"\n\nChou Jui's wife did not utter a word in reply.\n\n\"Sister Chou, what took you over on the other side?\" asked Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc.\n\n\"I was told that our madame Wang was over there,\" explained Mrs. Chou,\n\"and as I went to give her a message, 'aunt' Hs\u00c3\u00bceh seized the\nopportunity to ask me to bring over these flowers.\"\n\n\"What was cousin Pao Ch'ai doing at home?\" asked Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. \"How is it\nshe's not even been over for these few days?\"\n\n\"She's not quite well,\" remarked Mrs. Chou.\n\nWhen Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc heard this news, \"Who'll go,\" he speedily ascertained of the\nwaiting-maids, \"and inquire after her? Tell her that cousin Lin and I\nhave sent round to ask how our aunt and cousin are getting on! ask her\nwhat she's ailing from and what medicines she's taking, and explain to\nher that I know I ought to have gone over myself, but that on my coming\nback from school a short while back, I again got a slight chill; and\nthat I'll go in person another day.\"\n\nWhile Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was yet speaking, Hsi Hs\u00c3\u00bceh volunteered to take the\nmessage, and went off at once; and Mrs. Chou herself took her leave\nwithout another word.\n\nMrs. Chou's son-in-law was, in fact, Leng Tzu-hsing, the intimate friend\nof Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un. Having recently become involved with some party in a\nlawsuit, on account of the sale of some curios, he had expressly charged\nhis wife to come and sue for the favour (of a helping hand). Chou Jui's\nwife, relying upon her master's prestige, did not so much as take the\naffair to heart; and having waited till evening, she simply went over\nand requested lady Feng to befriend her, and the matter was forthwith\nended.\n\nWhen the lamps were lit, lady Feng came over, after having disrobed\nherself, to see madame Wang. \"I've already taken charge,\" she observed,\n\"of the things sent round to-day by the Chen family. As for the presents\nfrom us to them, we should avail ourselves of the return of the boats,\nby which the fresh delicacies for the new year were forwarded, to hand\nthem to them to carry back.\"\n\nMadame Wang nodded her head in token of approval.\n\n\"The birthday presents,\" continued lady Feng, \"for lady Ling Ngan, the\nmother of the Earl of Ling Ngan, have already been got together, and\nwhom will you depute to take them over?\"\n\n\"See,\" suggested madame Wang, \"who has nothing to do; let four maids go\nand all will be right! why come again and ask me?\"\n\n\"Our eldest sister-in-law Chen,\" proceeded lady Feng, \"came over to\ninvite me to go to-morrow to their place for a little change. I don't\nthink there will be anything for me to do to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Whether there be or not,\" replied madame Wang, \"it doesn't matter; you\nmust go, for whenever she comes with an invitation, it includes us, who\nare your seniors, so that, of course, it isn't such a pleasant thing for\nyou; but as she doesn't ask us this time, but only asks you, it's\nevident that she's anxious that you should have a little distraction,\nand you mustn't disappoint her good intention. Besides it's certainly\nright that you should go over for a change.\"\n\nLady Feng assented, and presently Li Wan, Ying Ch'un and the other\ncousins, likewise paid each her evening salutation and retired to their\nrespective rooms, where nothing of any notice transpired.\n\nThe next day lady Feng completed her toilette, and came over first to\ntell madame Wang that she was off, and then went to say good-bye to\ndowager lady Chia; but when Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc heard where she was going, he also\nwished to go; and as lady Feng had no help but to give in, and to wait\nuntil he had changed his clothes, the sister and brother-in-law got into\na carriage, and in a short while entered the Ning mansion.\n\nMrs. Yu, the wife of Chia Chen, and Mrs. Ch'in, the wife of Mr. Chia\nJung, the two sisters-in-law, had, along with a number of maids,\nwaiting-girls, and other servants, come as far as the ceremonial gate to\nreceive them, and Mrs. Yu, upon meeting lady Feng, for a while indulged,\nas was her wont, in humorous remarks, after which, leading Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc by the\nhand, they entered the drawing room and took their seats, Mrs. Ch'in\nhanded tea round.\n\n\"What have you people invited me to come here for?\" promptly asked lady\nFeng; \"if you have anything to present me with, hand it to me at once,\nfor I've other things to attend to.\"\n\nMrs. Yu and Mrs. Ch'in had barely any time to exchange any further\nremarks, when several matrons interposed, smilingly: \"Had our lady not\ncome to-day, there would have been no help for it, but having come, you\ncan't have it all your own way.\"\n\nWhile they were conversing about one thing and another, they caught\nsight of Chia Jung come in to pay his respects, which prompted Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc to\ninquire, \"Isn't my elder brother at home to-day?\"\n\n\"He's gone out of town to-day,\" replied Mrs. Yu, \"to inquire after his\ngrandfather. You'll find sitting here,\" she continued, \"very dull, and\nwhy not go out and have a stroll?\"\n\n\"A strange coincidence has taken place to-day,\" urged Mrs. Ch'in, with a\nsmile; \"some time back you, uncle Pao, expressed a wish to see my\nbrother, and to-day he too happens to be here at home. I think he's in\nthe library; but why not go and see for yourself, uncle Pao?\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc descended at once from the stove-couch, and was about to go, when\nMrs. Yu bade the servants to mind and go with him. \"Don't you let him\nget into trouble,\" she enjoined. \"It's a far different thing when he\ncomes over under the charge of his grandmother, when he's all right.\"\n\n\"If that be so,\" remarked lady Feng, \"why not ask the young gentleman to\ncome in, and then I too can see him. There isn't, I hope, any objection\nto my seeing him?\"\n\n\"Never mind! never mind!\" observed Mrs. Yu, smilingly; \"it's as well\nthat you shouldn't see him. This brother of mine is not, like the boys\nof our Chia family, accustomed to roughly banging and knocking about.\nOther people's children are brought up politely and properly, and not in\nthis vixenish style of yours. Why, you'd ridicule him to death!\"\n\n\"I won't laugh at him then, that's all,\" smiled lady Feng; \"tell them to\nbring him in at once.\"\n\n\"He's shy,\" proceeded Mrs. Ch'in, \"and has seen nothing much of the\nworld, so that you are sure to be put out when you see him, sister.\"\n\n\"What an idea!\" exclaimed lady Feng. \"Were he even No Cha himself, I'd\nlike to see him; so don't talk trash; if, after all, you don't bring him\nround at once, I'll give you a good slap on the mouth.\"\n\n\"I daren't be obstinate,\" answered Mrs. Ch'in smiling; \"I'll bring him\nround!\"\n\nIn a short while she did in fact lead in a young lad, who, compared with\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, was somewhat more slight but, from all appearances, superior to\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc in eyes and eyebrows, (good looks), which were so clear and\nwell-defined, in white complexion and in ruddy lips, as well as graceful\nappearance and pleasing manners. He was however bashful and timid, like\na girl.\n\nIn a shy and demure way, he made a bow to lady Feng and asked after her\nhealth.\n\nLady Feng was simply delighted with him. \"You take a low seat next to\nhim!\" she ventured laughingly as she first pushed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc back. Then\nreadily stooping forward, she took this lad by the hand and asked him to\ntake a seat next to her. Presently she inquired about his age, his\nstudies and such matters, when she found that at school he went under\nthe name of Ch'in Chung.\n\nThe matrons and maids in attendance on lady Feng, perceiving that this\nwas the first time their mistress met Ch'in Chung, (and knowing) that\nshe had not at hand the usual presents, forthwith ran over to the other\nside and told P'ing Erh about it.\n\nP'ing Erh, aware of the close intimacy that existed between lady Feng\nand Mrs. Ch'in, speedily took upon herself to decide, and selecting a\npiece of silk, and two small gold medals, (bearing the wish that he\nshould attain) the highest degree, the senior wranglership, she handed\nthem to the servants who had come over, to take away.\n\nLady Feng, however, explained that her presents were too mean by far,\nbut Mrs. Ch'in and the others expressed their appreciation of them; and\nin a short time the repast was over, and Mrs. Yu, lady Feng and Mrs.\nCh'in played at dominoes, but of this no details need be given; while\nboth Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc and Ch'in Chung sat down, got up and talked, as they\npleased.\n\nSince he had first glanced at Ch'in Chung, and seen what kind of person\nhe was, he felt at heart as if he had lost something, and after being\nplunged in a dazed state for a time, he began again to give way to\nfoolish thoughts in his mind.\n\n\"There are then such beings as he in the world!\" he reflected. \"I now\nsee there are! I'm however no better than a wallowing pig or a mangy\ncow! Despicable destiny! why was I ever born in this household of a\nmarquis and in the mansion of a duke? Had I seen the light in the home\nof some penniless scholar, or poverty-stricken official, I could long\nago have enjoyed the communion of his friendship, and I would not have\nlived my whole existence in vain! Though more honourable than he, it is\nindeed evident that silk and satins only serve to swathe this rotten\ntrunk of mine, and choice wines and rich meats only to gorge the filthy\ndrain and miry sewer of this body of mine! Wealth! and splendour! ye are\nno more than contaminated with pollution by me!\"\n\nEver since Ch'in Chung had noticed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's unusual appearance, his\nsedate deportment, and what is more, his hat ornamented with gold, and\nhis dress full of embroidery, attended by beautiful maids and handsome\nyouths, he did not indeed think it a matter of surprise that every one\nwas fond of him.\n\n\"Born as I have had the misfortune to be,\" he went on to commune within\nhimself, \"in an honest, though poor family, how can I presume to enjoy\nhis companionship! This is verily a proof of what a barrier poverty and\nwealth set between man and man. What a serious misfortune is this too in\nthis mortal world!\"\n\nIn wild and inane ideas of the same strain, indulged these two youths!\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc by and by further asked of him what books he was reading, and\nCh'in Chung, in answer to these inquiries, told him the truth. A few\nmore questions and answers followed; and after about ten remarks, a\ngreater intimacy sprang up between them.\n\nTea and fruits were shortly served, and while they were having their\ntea, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc suggested, \"We two don't take any wine, and why shouldn't we\nhave our fruit served on the small couch inside, and go and sit there,\nand thus save you all the trouble?\"\n\nThe two of them thereupon came into the inner apartment to have their\ntea; and Mrs. Ch'in attended to the laying out of fruit and wines for\nlady Feng, and hurriedly entered the room and hinted to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc: \"Dear\nuncle Pao, your nephew is young, and should he happen to say anything\ndisrespectful, do please overlook it, for my sake, for though shy, he's\nnaturally of a perverse and wilful disposition, and is rather given to\nhaving his own way.\"\n\n\"Off with you!\" cried Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc laughing; \"I know it all.\" Mrs. Ch'in then\nwent on to give a bit of advice to her brother, and at length came to\nkeep lady Feng company. Presently lady Feng and Mrs. Yu sent another\nservant to tell Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc that there was outside of everything they might\nwish to eat and that they should mind and go and ask for it; and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\nsimply signified that they would; but his mind was not set upon drinking\nor eating; all he did was to keep making inquiries of Ch'in Chung about\nrecent family concerns.\n\nCh'in Chung went on to explain that his tutor had last year relinquished\nhis post, that his father was advanced in years and afflicted with\ndisease, and had multifarious public duties to preoccupy his mind, so\nthat he had as yet had no time to make arrangements for another tutor,\nand that all he did was no more than to keep up his old tasks; that as\nregards study, it was likewise necessary to have the company of one or\ntwo intimate friends, as then only, by dint of a frequent exchange of\nideas and opinions, one could arrive at progress; and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc gave him no\ntime to complete, but eagerly urged, \"Quite so! But in our household, we\nhave a family school, and those of our kindred who have no means\nsufficient to engage the services of a tutor are at liberty to come over\nfor the sake of study, and the sons and brothers of our relatives are\nlikewise free to join the class. As my own tutor went home last year, I\nam now also wasting my time doing nothing; my father's intention was\nthat I too should have gone over to this school, so that I might at\nleast temporarily keep up what I have already read, pending the arrival\nof my tutor next year, when I could again very well resume my studies\nalone at home. But my grandmother raised objections; maintaining first\nof all, that the boys who attend the family classes being so numerous,\nshe feared we would be sure to be up to mischief, which wouldn't be at\nall proper; and that, in the second place, as I had been ill for some\ntime, the matter should be dropped, for the present. But as, from what\nyou say, your worthy father is very much exercised on this score, you\nshould, on your return, tell him all about it, and come over to our\nschool. I'll also be there as your schoolmate; and as you and I will\nreap mutual benefit from each other's companionship, won't it be nice!\"\n\n\"When my father was at home the other day,\" Ch'in Chung smiled and said,\n\"he alluded to the question of a tutor, and explained that the free\nschools were an excellent institution. He even meant to have come and\ntalked matters over with his son-in-law's father about my introduction,\nbut with the urgent concerns here, he didn't think it right for him to\ncome about this small thing, and make any trouble. But if you really\nbelieve that I might be of use to you, in either grinding the ink, or\nwashing the slab, why shouldn't you at once make the needful\narrangements, so that neither you nor I may idle our time? And as we\nshall be able to come together often and talk matters over, and set at\nthe same time our parents' minds at ease, and to enjoy the pleasure of\nfriendship, won't it be a profitable thing!\"\n\n\"Compose your mind!\" suggested Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. \"We can by and by first of all,\ntell your brother-in-law, and your sister as well as sister-in-law\nSecunda Lien; and on your return home to-day, lose no time in explaining\nall to your worthy father, and when I get back, I'll speak to my\ngrandmother; and I can't see why our wishes shouldn't speedily be\naccomplished.\"\n\nBy the time they had arrived at this conclusion, the day was far\nadvanced, and the lights were about to be lit; and they came out and\nwatched them once more for a time as they played at dominoes. When they\ncame to settle their accounts Mrs. Ch'in and Mrs. Yu were again the\nlosers and had to bear the expense of a theatrical and dinner party; and\nwhile deciding that they should enjoy this treat the day after the\nmorrow, they also had the evening repast.\n\nDarkness having set in, Mrs. Yu gave orders that two youths should\naccompany Mr. Ch'in home. The matrons went out to deliver the\ndirections, and after a somewhat long interval, Ch'in Chung said goodbye\nand was about to start on his way.\n\n\"Whom have you told off to escort him?\" asked Mrs. Yu.\n\n\"Chiao Ta,\" replied the matrons, \"has been told to go, but it happens\nthat he's under the effects of drink and making free use again of\nabusive language.\"\n\nMrs. Yu and Mrs. Chin remonstrated. \"What's the use,\" they said, \"of\nasking him? that mean fellow shouldn't be chosen, but you will go again\nand provoke him.\"\n\n\"People always maintain,\" added lady Feng, \"that you are far too\nlenient. But fancy allowing servants in this household to go on in this\nway; why, what will be the end of it?\"\n\n\"You don't mean to tell me,\" observed Mrs. Yu, \"that you don't know this\nChiao Ta? Why, even the gentlemen one and all pay no heed to his doings!\nyour eldest brother, Chia Cheng, he too doesn't notice him. It's all\nbecause when he was young he followed our ancestor in three or four\nwars, and because on one occasion, by extracting our senior from the\nheap of slain and carrying him on his back, he saved his life. He\nhimself suffered hunger and stole food for his master to eat; they had\nno water for two days; and when he did get half a bowl, he gave it to\nhis master, while he himself had sewage water. He now simply presumes\nupon the sentimental obligations imposed by these services. When the\nseniors of the family still lived, they all looked upon him with\nexceptional regard; but who at present ventures to interfere with him?\nHe is also advanced in years, and doesn't care about any decent manners;\nhis sole delight is wine; and when he gets drunk, there isn't a single\nperson whom he won't abuse. I've again and again told the stewards not\nto henceforward ask Chiao Ta to do any work whatever, but to treat him\nas dead and gone; and here he's sent again to-day.\"\n\n\"How can I not know all about this Chiao Ta?\" remarked lady Feng; \"but\nthe secret of all this trouble is, that you won't take any decisive\nstep. Why not pack him off to some distant farm, and have done with\nhim?\" And as she spoke, \"Is our carriage ready?\" she went on to inquire.\n\n\"All ready and waiting,\" interposed the married women.\n\nLady Feng also got up, said good-bye, and hand in hand with Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, they\nwalked out of the room, escorted by Mrs. Yu and the party, as far as the\nentrance of the Main Hall, where they saw the lamps shedding a brilliant\nlight and the attendants all waiting on the platforms. Chiao Ta,\nhowever, availing himself of Chia Chen's absence from home, and elated\nby wine, began to abuse the head steward Lai Erh for his injustice.\n\n\"You bully of the weak and coward with the strong,\" he cried, \"when\nthere's any pleasant charge, you send the other servants, but when it's\na question of seeing any one home in the dark, then you ask me, you\ndisorderly clown! a nice way you act the steward, indeed! Do you forget\nthat if Mr. Chiao Ta chose to raise one leg, it would be a good deal\nhigher than your head! Remember please, that twenty years ago, Mr. Chiao\nTa wouldn't even so much as look at any one, no matter who it was; not\nto mention a pack of hybrid creatures like yourselves!\"\n\nWhile he went on cursing and railing with all his might, Chia Jung\nappeared walking by lady Feng's carriage. All the servants having tried\nto hush him and not succeeding, Chia Jung became exasperated; and\nforthwith blew him up for a time. \"Let some one bind him up,\" he cried,\n\"and tomorrow, when he's over the wine, I'll call him to task, and we'll\nsee if he won't seek death.\"\n\nChiao Ta showed no consideration for Chia Jung. On the contrary, he\nshouted with more vigour. Going up to Chia Jung: \"Brother Jung,\" he\nsaid, \"don't put on the airs of a master with Chiao Ta. Not to speak of\na man such as you, why even your father and grandfather wouldn't presume\nto display such side with Chiao Ta. Were it not for Chiao Ta, and him\nalone, where would your office, honours, riches and dignity be? Your\nancestor, whom I brought back from the jaws of death, heaped up all this\nestate, but up to this very day have I received no thanks for the\nservices I rendered! on the contrary, you come here and play the master;\ndon't say a word more, and things may come right; but if you do, I'll\nplunge the blade of a knife white in you and extract it red.\"\n\nLady Feng, from inside the carriage, remarked to Chia Jung: \"Don't you\nyet pack off this insolent fellow! Why, if you keep him in your house,\nwon't he be a source of mischief? Besides, were relatives and friends to\nhear about these things, won't they have a laugh at our expense, that a\nhousehold like ours should be so devoid of all propriety?\"\n\nChia Jung assented. The whole band of servants finding that Chiao Ta was\ngetting too insolent had no help but to come up and throw him over, and\nbinding him up, they dragged him towards the stables. Chiao Ta abused\neven Chia Chen with still more vehemence, and shouted in a boisterous\nmanner. \"I want to go,\" he cried, \"to the family Ancestral Temple and\nmourn my old master. Who would have ever imagined that he would leave\nbehind such vile creatures of descendants as you all, day after day\nindulging in obscene and incestuous practices, 'in scraping of the\nashes' and in philandering with brothers-in-law. I know all about your\ndoings; the best thing is to hide one's stump of an arm in one's\nsleeve!\" (wash one's dirty clothes at home).\n\nThe servants who stood by, upon hearing this wild talk, were quite at\ntheir wits' end, and they at once seized him, tied him up, and filled\nhis mouth to the fullest extent with mud mixed with some horse refuse.\n\nLady Feng and Chia Jung heard all he said from a distance, but pretended\nnot to hear; but Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, seated in the carriage as he was, also caught\nthis extravagant talk and inquired of lady Feng: \"Sister, did you hear\nhim say something about 'scraping of the ashes?' What's it?\"\n\n\"Don't talk such rubbish!\" hastily shouted lady Feng; \"it was the\nmaudlin talk of a drunkard! A nice boy you are! not to speak of your\nlistening, but you must also inquire! wait and I'll tell your mother and\nwe'll see if she doesn't seriously take you to task.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc was in such a state of fright that he speedily entreated her to\nforgive him. \"My dear sister,\" he craved, \"I won't venture again to say\nanything of the kind\"\n\n\"My dear brother, if that be so, it's all right!\" rejoined lady Feng\nreassuringly; \"on our return we'll speak to her venerable ladyship and\nask her to send some one to arrange matters in the family school, and\ninvite Ch'in Chung to come to school for his studies.\"\n\nWhile yet this conversation was going on, they arrived at the Jung\nMansion.\n\nReader, do you wish to know what follows? if you do, the next chapter\nwill unfold it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n  By a strange coincidence, Chia Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc becomes acquainted with the\n      golden clasp.\n  In an unexpected meeting, Hs\u00c3\u00bceh Pao-ch'ai sees the jade of spiritual\n      perception.\n\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc and lady Feng, we will now explain, paid, on their return home,\ntheir respects to all the inmates, and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc availed himself of the\nfirst occasion to tell dowager lady Chia of his wish that Ch'in Chung\nshould come over to the family school. \"The presence for himself of a\nfriend as schoolmate would,\" he argued, \"be fitly excellent to stir him\nto zeal,\" and he went on to speak in terms of high praise of Ch'in\nChung, his character and his manners, which most of all made people\nesteem him.\n\nLady Feng besides stood by him and backed his request. \"In a day or\ntwo,\" she added, \"Ch'in Chung will be coming to pay his obeisance to\nyour venerable ladyship.\"\n\nThis bit of news greatly rejoiced the heart of dowager lady Chia, and\nlady Feng likewise did not let the opportunity slip, without inviting\nthe old lady to attend the theatrical performance to come off the day\nafter the morrow. Dowager lady Chia was, it is true, well on in years,\nbut was, nevertheless, very fond of enjoyment, so that when the day\narrived and Mrs. Yu came over to invite her round, she forthwith took\nmadame Wang, Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc and others along and went to the play.\n\nIt was about noon, when dowager lady Chia returned to her apartments for\nher siesta; and madame Wang, who was habitually partial to a quiet life,\nalso took her departure after she had seen the old lady retire. Lady\nFeng subsequently took the seat of honour; and the party enjoyed\nthemselves immensely till the evening, when they broke up.\n\nBut to return to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. Having accompanied his grandmother Chia back\nhome, and waited till her ladyship was in her midday sleep, he had in\nfact an inclination to return to the performance, but he was afraid lest\nhe should be a burden to Mrs. Ch'in and the rest and lest they should\nnot feel at ease. Remembering therefore that Pao Ch'ai had been at home\nunwell for the last few days, and that he had not been to see her, he\nwas anxious to go and look her up, but he dreaded that if he went by the\nside gate, at the back of the drawing-room, he would be prevented by\nsomething or other, and fearing, what would be making matters worse,\nlest he should come across his father, he consequently thought it better\nto go on his way by a detour. The nurses and waiting-maids thereupon\ncame to help him to change his clothes; but they saw him not change, but\ngo out again by the second door. These nurses and maids could not help\nfollowing him out; but they were still under the impression that he was\ngoing over to the other mansion to see the theatricals. Contrary to\ntheir speculations, upon reaching the entrance hall, he forthwith went\nto the east, then turned to the north, and walking round by the rear of\nthe hall, he happened to come face to face with two of the family\ncompanions, Mr. Ch'an Kuang, and Mr. Tan T'ing-jen. As soon as they\ncaught sight of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, they both readily drew up to him, and as they\nsmiled, the one put his arm round his waist, while the other grasped him\nby the hand.\n\n\"Oh divine brother!\" they both exclaimed, \"this we call dreaming a\npleasant dream, for it's no easy thing to come across you!\"\n\nWhile continuing their remarks they paid their salutations, and inquired\nafter his health; and it was only after they had chatted for ever so\nlong, that they went on their way. The nurse called out to them and\nstopped them, \"Have you two gentlemen,\" she said, \"come out from seeing\nmaster?\"\n\nThey both nodded assent. \"Your master,\" they explained, \"is in the Meng\nP'o Chai small library having his siesta; so that you can go through\nthere with no fear.\"\n\nAs they uttered these words, they walked away.\n\nThis remark also evoked a smile from Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, but without further delay\nhe turned a corner, went towards the north, and came into the Pear\nFragrance Court, where, as luck would have it, he met the head manager\nof the Household Treasury, Wu Hsin-teng, who, in company with the head\nof the granary, Tai Liang, and several other head stewards, seven\npersons in all, was issuing out of the Account Room.\n\nOn seeing Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc approaching, they, in a body, stood still, and hung\ndown their arms against their sides. One of them alone, a certain\nbutler, called Ch'ien Hua, promptly came forward, as he had not seen\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc for many a day, and bending on one knee, paid his respects to\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc at once gave a smile and pulled him up.\n\n\"The day before yesterday,\" smiled all the bystanders, \"we were\nsomewhere together and saw some characters written by you, master\nSecundus, in the composite style. The writing is certainly better than\nit was before! When will you give us a few sheets to stick on the wall?\"\n\n\"Where did you see them?\" inquired Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, with a grin.\n\n\"They are to be found in more than one place,\" they replied, \"and every\none praises them very much, and what's more, asks us for a few.\"\n\n\"They are not worth having,\" observed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc smilingly; \"but if you do\nwant any, tell my young servants and it will be all right.\"\n\nAs he said these words, he moved onwards. The whole party waited till he\nhad gone by, before they separated, each one to go his own way.\n\nBut we need not dilate upon matters of no moment, but return to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc.\n\nOn coming to the Pear Fragrance Court, he entered, first, into \"aunt\"\nHs\u00c3\u00bceh's room, where he found her getting some needlework ready to give\nto the waiting-maids to work at. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc forthwith paid his respects to\nher, and \"aunt\" Hs\u00c3\u00bceh, taking him by the hand, drew him towards her and\nclasped him in her embrace.\n\n\"With this cold weather,\" she smilingly urged, \"it's too kind of you, my\ndear child, to think of coming to see me; come along on the stove-couch\nat once!--Bring some tea,\" she continued, addressing the servants, \"and\nmake it as hot as it can be!\"\n\n\"Isn't Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an at home?\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc having inquired: \"He's like a horse\nwithout a halter,\" Mrs. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh remarked with a sigh; \"he's daily running\nhere and there and everywhere, and nothing can induce him to stay at\nhome one single day.\"\n\n\"Is sister (Pao Ch'ai) all right again?\" asked Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. \"Yes,\" replied\nMrs. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh, \"she's well again. It was very kind of you two days ago to\nagain think of her, and send round to inquire after her. She's now in\nthere, and you can go and see her. It's warmer there than it's here; go\nand sit with her inside, and, as soon as I've put everything away, I'll\ncome and join you and have a chat.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, upon hearing this, jumped down with alacrity from the\nstove-couch, and walked up to the door of the inner room, where he saw\nhanging a porti\u00c3\u00a8re somewhat the worse for use, made of red silk. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\nraised the porti\u00c3\u00a8re and making one step towards the interior, he found\nPao Ch'ai seated on the couch, busy over some needlework. On the top of\nher head was gathered, and made into a knot, her chevelure, black as\nlacquer, and glossy like pomade. She wore a honey-coloured wadded robe,\na rose-brown short-sleeved jacket, lined with the fur of the squirrel of\ntwo colours: the \"gold and silver;\" and a jupe of leek-yellow silk. Her\nwhole costume was neither too new, neither too old, and displayed no\nsign of extravagance.\n\nHer lips, though not rouged, were naturally red; her eyebrows, though\nnot pencilled, were yet blue black; her face resembled a silver basin,\nand her eyes, juicy plums. She was sparing in her words, chary in her\ntalk, so much so that people said that she posed as a simpleton. She was\nquiet in the acquittal of her duties and scrupulous as to the proper\nseason for everything. \"I practise simplicity,\" she would say of\nherself.\n\n\"How are you? are you quite well again, sister?\" inquired Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, as he\ngazed at her; whereupon Pao Ch'ai raised her head, and perceiving Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\nwalk in, she got up at once and replied with a smile, \"I'm all right\nagain; many thanks for your kindness in thinking of me.\"\n\nWhile uttering this, she pressed him to take a seat on the stove-couch,\nand as he sat down on the very edge of the couch, she told Ying Erh to\nbring tea and asked likewise after dowager lady Chia and lady Feng. \"And\nare all the rest of the young ladies quite well?\" she inquired.\n\nSaying this she scrutinised Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, who she saw had a head-dress of\npurplish-gold twisted threads, studded with precious stones. His\nforehead was bound with a gold circlet, representing two dragons,\nclasping a pearl. On his person he wore a light yellow, archery-sleeved\njacket, ornamented with rampant dragons, and lined with fur from the\nribs of the silver fox; and was clasped with a dark sash, embroidered\nwith different-coloured butterflies and birds. Round his neck was hung\nan amulet, consisting of a clasp of longevity, a talisman of recorded\nname, and, in addition to these, the precious jade which he had had in\nhis mouth at the time of his birth.\n\n\"I've daily heard every one speak of this jade,\" said Pao Ch'ai with a\nsmile, \"but haven't, after all, had an opportunity of looking at it\nclosely, but anyhow to-day I must see it.\"\n\nAs she spoke, she drew near. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc himself approached, and taking it\nfrom his neck, he placed it in Pao Ch'ai's hand. Pao Ch'ai held it in\nher palm. It appeared to her very much like the egg of a bird,\nresplendent as it was like a bright russet cloud; shiny and smooth like\nvariegated curd and covered with a net for the sake of protection.\n\nReaders, you should know that this was the very block of useless stone\nwhich had been on the Ta Huang Hills, and which had dropped into the\nCh'ing Keng cave, in a state of metamorphosis. A later writer expresses\nhis feelings in a satirical way as follows:\n\n  N\u00c3\u00bc Wo's fusion of stones was e'er a myth inane,\n  But from this myth hath sprung fiction still more insane!\n  Lost is the subtle life, divine, and real!--gone!\n  Assumed, mean subterfuge! foul bags of skin and bone!\n  Fortune, when once adverse, how true! gold glows no more!\n  In evil days, alas! the jade's splendour is o'er!\n  Bones, white and bleached, in nameless hill-like mounds are flung,\n  Bones once of youths renowned and maidens fair and young.\n\nThe rejected stone has in fact already given a record of the\ncircumstances of its transformation, and the inscription in seal\ncharacters, engraved upon it by the bald-headed bonze, and below will\nnow be also appended a faithful representation of it; but its real size\nis so very diminutive, as to allow of its being held by a child in his\nmouth while yet unborn, that were it to have been drawn in its exact\nproportions, the characters would, it is feared, have been so\ninsignificant in size, that the beholder would have had to waste much of\nhis eyesight, and it would besides have been no pleasant thing.\n\nWhile therefore its shape has been adhered to, its size has unavoidably\nbeen slightly enlarged, to admit of the reader being able, conveniently,\nto peruse the inscription, even by very lamplight, and though he may be\nunder the influence of wine.\n\nThese explanations have been given to obviate any such sneering remarks\nas: \"What could be, pray, the size of the mouth of a child in his\nmother's womb, and how could it grasp such a large and clumsy thing?\"\n\nOn the face of the jade was written:\n\n  Precious Gem of Spiritual Perception.\n  If thou wilt lose me not and never forget me,\n  Eternal life and constant luck will be with thee!\n\nOn the reverse was written:\n\n  1 To exorcise evil spirits and the accessory visitations;\n  2 To cure predestined sickness;\n  3 To prognosticate weal and woe.\n\nPao Ch'ai having looked at the amulet, twisted it again to the face, and\nscrutinising it closely, read aloud:\n\n  If thou wilt lose me not and never forget me,\n  Eternal life and constant luck will be with thee!\n\nShe perused these lines twice, and, turning round, she asked Ying Erh\nlaughingly: \"Why don't you go and pour the tea? what are you standing\nhere like an idiot!\"\n\n\"These two lines which I've heard,\" smiled Ying Erh, \"would appear to\npair with the two lines on your necklet, miss!\"\n\n\"What!\" eagerly observed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc with a grin, when he caught these words,\n\"are there really eight characters too on your necklet, cousin? do let\nme too see it.\"\n\n\"Don't listen to what she says,\" remarked Pao Ch'ai, \"there are no\ncharacters on it.\"\n\n\"My dear cousin,\" pleaded Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc entreatingly, \"how is it you've seen\nmine?\"\n\nPao Ch'ai was brought quite at bay by this remark of his, and she\nconsequently added, \"There are also two propitious phrases engraved on\nthis charm, and that's why I wear it every day. Otherwise, what pleasure\nwould there be in carrying a clumsy thing.\"\n\nAs she spoke, she unfastened the button, and produced from inside her\ncrimson robe, a crystal-like locket, set with pearls and gems, and with\na brilliant golden fringe. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc promptly received it from her, and\nupon minute examination, found that there were in fact four characters\non each side; the eight characters on both sides forming two sentences\nof good omen. The similitude of the locket is likewise then given below.\nOn the face of the locket is written:\n\n  \"Part not from me and cast me not away;\"\n\nAnd on the reverse:\n\n  \"And youth, perennial freshness will display!\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc examined the charm, and having also read the inscription twice\nover aloud, and then twice again to himself, he said as he smiled, \"Dear\ncousin, these eight characters of yours form together with mine an\nantithetical verse.\"\n\n\"They were presented to her,\" ventured Ying Erh, \"by a mangy-pated\nbonze, who explained that they should be engraved on a golden\ntrinket....\"\n\nPao Ch'ai left her no time to finish what she wished to say, but\nspeedily called her to task for not going to bring the tea, and then\ninquired of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc \"Where he had come from?\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc had, by this time, drawn quite close to Pao Ch'ai, and perceived\nwhiff after whiff of some perfume or other, of what kind he could not\ntell. \"What perfume have you used, my cousin,\" he forthwith asked, \"to\nfumigate your dresses with? I really don't remember smelling any\nperfumery of the kind before.\"\n\n\"I'm very averse,\" replied Pao Ch'ai blandly, \"to the odour of\nfumigation; good clothes become impregnated with the smell of smoke.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" observed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"what scent is it?\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember,\" Pao Ch'ai answered, after some reflection; \"it's the\nscent of the 'cold fragrance' pills which I took this morning.\"\n\n\"What are these cold fragrance pills,\" remarked Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc smiling, \"that\nthey have such a fine smell? Give me, cousin, a pill to try.\"\n\n\"Here you are with your nonsense again,\" Pao Ch'ai rejoined laughingly;\n\"is a pill a thing to be taken recklessly?\"\n\nShe had scarcely finished speaking, when she heard suddenly some one\noutside say, \"Miss Lin is come;\" and shortly Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc walked in in a\njaunty manner.\n\n\"Oh, I come at a wrong moment!\" she exclaimed forthwith, smirking\nsignificantly when she caught sight of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc and the rest lost no time in rising and offering her a seat,\nwhereupon Pao Ch'ai added with a smile, \"How can you say such things?\"\n\n\"Had I known sooner,\" continued Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"that he was here, I would have\nkept away.\"\n\n\"I can't fathom this meaning of yours,\" protested Pao Ch'ai.\n\n\"If one comes,\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc urged smiling, \"then all come, and when one\ndoesn't come, then no one comes. Now were he to come to-day, and I to\ncome to-morrow, wouldn't there be, by a division of this kind, always\nsome one with you every day? and in this way, you wouldn't feel too\nlonely, nor too crowded. How is it, cousin, that you didn't understand\nwhat I meant to imply?\"\n\n\"Is it snowing?\" inquired Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, upon noticing that she wore a cloak\nmade of crimson camlet, buttoning in front.\n\n\"It has been snowing for some time,\" ventured the matrons, who were\nstanding below. \"Fetch my wrapper!\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc remarked, and Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc readily\nlaughed. \"Am I not right? I come, and, of course, he must go at once.\"\n\n\"Did I ever mention that I was going?\" questioned Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc; \"I only wish\nit brought to have it ready when I want it.\"\n\n\"It's a snowy day,\" consequently remarked Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's nurse, dame Li, \"and\nwe must also look to the time, but you had better remain here and amuse\nyourself with your cousin. Your aunt has, in there, got ready tea and\nfruits. I'll tell the waiting-maid to go and fetch your wrapper and the\nboys to return home.\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc assented, and nurse Li left the room and\ntold the boys that they were at liberty to go.\n\nBy this time Mrs. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh had prepared tea and several kinds of nice\nthings and kept them all to partake of those delicacies. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, having\nspoken highly of some goose feet and ducks' tongues he had tasted some\ndays before, at his eldest sister-in-law's, Mrs. Yu's, \"aunt\" Hs\u00c3\u00bceh\npromptly produced several dishes of the same kind, made by herself, and\ngave them to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc to try. \"With a little wine,\" added Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc with a\nsmile, \"they would be first rate.\"\n\nMrs. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh thereupon bade the servants fetch some wine of the best\nquality; but dame Li came forward and remonstrated. \"My lady,\" she said,\n\"never mind the wine.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc smilingly pleaded: \"My nurse, I'll take just one cup and no\nmore.\"\n\n\"It's no use,\" nurse Li replied, \"were your grandmother and mother\npresent, I wouldn't care if you drank a whole jar. I remember the day\nwhen I turned my eyes away but for a moment, and some ignorant fool or\nother, merely with the view of pandering for your favour, gave you only\na drop of wine to drink, and how this brought reproaches upon me for a\ncouple of days. You don't know, my lady, you have no idea of his\ndisposition! it's really dreadful; and when he has had a little wine he\nshows far more temper. On days when her venerable ladyship is in high\nspirits, she allows him to have his own way about drinking, but he's not\nallowed to have wine on any and every day; and why should I have to\nsuffer inside and all for nothing at all?\"\n\n\"You antiquated thing!\" replied Mrs. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh laughing, \"set your mind at\nease, and go and drink your own wine! I won't let him have too much, and\nshould even the old lady say anything, let the fault be mine.\"\n\nSaying this, she asked a waiting-maid to take nurse Li along with her\nand give her also a glass of wine so as to keep out the cold air.\n\nWhen nurse Li heard these words, she had no alternative but to go for a\ntime with all the others and have some wine to drink.\n\n\"The wine need not be warmed: I prefer it cold!\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc went on to\nsuggest meanwhile.\n\n\"That won't do,\" remonstrated Mrs. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh; \"cold wine will make your hand\ntremble when you write.\"\n\n\"You have,\" interposed Pao Ch'ai smiling, \"the good fortune, cousin\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, of having daily opportunities of acquiring a knowledge of every\nkind of subject, and yet don't you know that the properties of wine are\nmostly heating? If you drink wine warm, its effects soon dispel, but if\nyou drink it cold, it at once congeals in you; and as upon your\nintestines devolves the warming of it, how can you not derive any harm?\nand won't you yet from this time change this habit of yours? leave off\nat once drinking that cold wine.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc finding that the words he had heard contained a good deal of\nsense, speedily put down the cold wine, and having asked them to warm\nit, he at length drank it.\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc was bent upon cracking melon seeds, saying nothing but simply\npursing up her lips and smiling, when, strange coincidence, Hs\u00c3\u00bceh Yen,\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc's waiting-maid, walked in and handed her mistress a small\nhand-stove.\n\n\"Who told you to bring it?\" ascertained Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc grinningly. \"I'm sorry to\nhave given whoever it is the trouble; I'm obliged to her. But did she\never imagine that I would freeze to death?\"\n\n\"Tzu Chuan was afraid,\" replied Hs\u00c3\u00bceh Yen, \"that you would, miss, feel\ncold, and she asked me to bring it over.\"\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc took it over and held it in her lap. \"How is it,\" she smiled,\n\"that you listen to what she tells you, but that you treat what I say,\nday after day, as so much wind blowing past your ears! How is it that\nyou at once do what she bids you, with even greater alacrity than you\nwould an imperial edict?\"\n\nWhen Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc heard this, he felt sure in his mind that Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc was\navailing herself of this opportunity to make fun of him, but he made no\nremark, merely laughing to himself and paying no further notice. Pao\nCh'ai, again, knew full well that this habit was a weak point with\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc, so she too did not go out of her way to heed what she said.\n\n\"You've always been delicate and unable to stand the cold,\" interposed\n\"aunt\" Hs\u00c3\u00bceh, \"and is it not a kind attention on their part to have\nthought of you?\"\n\n\"You don't know, aunt, how it really stands,\" responded Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc\nsmilingly; \"fortunately enough, it was sent to me here at your quarters;\nfor had it been in any one else's house, wouldn't it have been a slight\nupon them? Is it forsooth nice to think that people haven't so much as a\nhand-stove, and that one has fussily to be sent over from home? People\nwon't say that the waiting-maids are too officious, but will imagine\nthat I'm in the habit of behaving in this offensive fashion.\"\n\n\"You're far too punctilious,\" remarked Mrs. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh, \"as to entertain such\nnotions! No such ideas as these crossed my mind just now.\"\n\nWhile they were conversing, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had taken so much as three cups of\nwine, and nurse Li came forward again to prevent him from having any\nmore. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was just then in a state of exultation and excitement, (a\nstate) enhanced by the conversation and laughter of his cousins, so that\nwas he ready to agree to having no more! But he was constrained in a\nhumble spirit to entreat for permission. \"My dear nurse,\" he implored,\n\"I'll just take two more cups and then have no more.\"\n\n\"You'd better be careful,\" added nurse Li, \"your father is at home\nto-day, and see that you're ready to be examined in your lessons.\"\n\nWhen Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc heard this mention, his spirits at once sank within him, and\ngently putting the wine aside, he dropped his head upon his breast.\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc promptly remonstrated. \"You've thrown cold water,\" she said,\n\"over the spirits of the whole company; why, if uncle should ask to see\nyou, well, say that aunt Hs\u00c3\u00bceh detained you. This old nurse of yours has\nbeen drinking, and again makes us the means of clearing her muddled\nhead!\"\n\nWhile saying this, she gave Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc a big nudge with the intent of\nstirring up his spirits, adding, as she addressed him in a low tone of\nvoice: \"Don't let us heed that old thing, but mind our own enjoyment.\"\n\nDame Li also knew very well Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc's disposition, and therefore\nremarked: \"Now, Miss Lin, don't you urge him on; you should after all,\ngive him good advice, as he may, I think, listen to a good deal of what\nyou say to him.\"\n\n\"Why should I urge him on?\" rejoined Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, with a sarcastic smile,\n\"nor will I trouble myself to give him advice. You, old lady, are far\ntoo scrupulous! Old lady Chia has also time after time given him wine,\nand if he now takes a cup or two more here, at his aunt's, lady Hs\u00c3\u00bceh's\nhouse, there's no harm that I can see. Is it perhaps, who knows, that\naunt is a stranger in this establishment, and that we have in fact no\nright to come over here to see her?\"\n\nNurse Li was both vexed and amused by the words she had just heard.\n\"Really,\" she observed, \"every remark this girl Lin utters is sharper\nthan a razor! I didn't say anything much!\"\n\nPao Ch'ai too could not suppress a smile, and as she pinched Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc's\ncheek, she exclaimed, \"Oh the tongue of this frowning girl! one can\nneither resent what it says, nor yet listen to it with any\ngratification!\"\n\n\"Don't be afraid!\" Mrs. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh went on to say, \"don't be afraid; my son,\nyou've come to see me, and although I've nothing good to give you, you\nmustn't, through fright, let the trifle you've taken lie heavy on your\nstomach, and thus make me uneasy; but just drink at your pleasure, and\nas much as you like, and let the blame fall on my shoulders. What's\nmore, you can stay to dinner with me, and then go home; or if you do get\ntipsy, you can sleep with me, that's all.\"\n\nShe thereupon told the servants to heat some more wine. \"I'll come,\" she\ncontinued, \"and keep you company while you have two or three cups, after\nwhich we'll have something to eat!\"\n\nIt was only after these assurances that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's spirits began at\nlength, once more to revive, and dame Li then directed the waiting-maids\nwhat to do. \"You remain here,\" she enjoined, \"and mind, be diligent\nwhile I go home and change; when I'll come back again. Don't allow him,\"\nshe also whispered to \"aunt\" Hs\u00c3\u00bceh, \"to have all his own way and drink\ntoo much.\"\n\nHaving said this, she betook herself back to her quarters; and during\nthis while, though there were two or three nurses in attendance, they\ndid not concern themselves with what was going on. As soon as they saw\nthat nurse Li had left, they likewise all quietly slipped out, at the\nfirst opportunity they found, while there remained but two\nwaiting-maids, who were only too glad to curry favour with Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. But\nfortunately \"aunt\" Hs\u00c3\u00bceh, by much coaxing and persuading, only let him\nhave a few cups, and the wine being then promptly cleared away, pickled\nbamboo shoots and chicken-skin soup were prepared, of which Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc drank\nwith relish several bowls full, eating besides more than half a bowl of\nfinest rice congee.\n\nBy this time, Hs\u00c3\u00bceh Pao Ch'ai and Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc had also finished their\nrepast; and when Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had drunk a few cups of strong tea, Mrs. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh\nfelt more easy in her mind. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh Yen and the others, three or four of\nthem in all, had also had their meal, and came in to wait upon them.\n\n\"Are you now going or not?\" inquired Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc looked askance with his drowsy eyes. \"If you want to go,\" he\nobserved, \"I'll go with you.\"\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc hearing this, speedily rose. \"We've been here nearly the whole\nday,\" she said, \"and ought to be going back.\"\n\nAs she spoke the two of them bade good-bye, and the waiting-maids at\nonce presented a hood to each of them.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc readily lowered his head slightly and told a waiting-maid to put\nit on. The girl promptly took the hood, made of deep red cloth, and\nshaking it out of its folds, she put it on Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's head.\n\n\"That will do,\" hastily exclaimed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. \"You stupid thing! gently a\nbit; is it likely you've never seen any one put one on before? let me do\nit myself.\"\n\n\"Come over here, and I'll put it on for you,\" suggested Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, as she\nstood on the edge of the couch. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc eagerly approached her, and\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc carefully kept the cap, to which his hair was bound, fast down,\nand taking the hood she rested its edge on the circlet round his\nforehead. She then raised the ball of crimson velvet, which was as large\nas a walnut, and put it in such a way that, as it waved tremulously, it\nshould appear outside the hood. These arrangements completed she cast a\nlook for a while at what she had done. \"That's right now,\" she added,\n\"throw your wrapper over you!\"\n\nWhen Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc caught these words, he eventually took the wrapper and threw\nit over his shoulders.\n\n\"None of your nurses,\" hurriedly interposed aunt Hs\u00c3\u00bceh, \"are yet come,\nso you had better wait a while.\"\n\n\"Why should we wait for them?\" observed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. \"We have the\nwaiting-maids to escort us, and surely they should be enough.\"\n\nMrs. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh finding it difficult to set her mind at ease deputed two\nmarried women to accompany the two cousins; and after they had both\nexpressed (to these women) their regret at having troubled them, they\ncame straightway to dowager lady Chia's suite of apartments.\n\nHer venerable ladyship had not, as yet, had her evening repast. Hearing\nthat they had been at Mrs. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh's, she was extremely pleased; but\nnoticing that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had had some wine, she gave orders that he should\nbe taken to his room, and put to bed, and not be allowed to come out\nagain.\n\n\"Do take good care of him,\" she therefore enjoined the servants, and\nwhen suddenly she bethought herself of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's attendants, \"How is it,\"\nshe at once inquired of them all, \"that I don't see nurse Li here?\"\n\nThey did not venture to tell her the truth, that she had gone home, but\nsimply explained that she had come in a few moments back, and that they\nthought she must have again gone out on some business or other.\n\n\"She's better off than your venerable ladyship,\" remarked Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc,\nturning round and swaying from side to side. \"Why then ask after her?\nWere I rid of her, I believe I might live a little longer.\"\n\nWhile uttering these words, he reached the door of his bedroom, where he\nsaw pen and ink laid out on the writing table.\n\n\"That's nice,\" exclaimed Ch'ing Wen, as she came to meet him with a\nsmile on her face, \"you tell me to prepare the ink for you, but though\nwhen you get up, you were full of the idea of writing, you only wrote\nthree characters, when you discarded the pencil, and ran away, fooling\nme, by making me wait the whole day! Come now at once and exhaust all\nthis ink before you're let off.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc then remembered what had taken place in the morning. \"Where are\nthe three characters I wrote?\" he consequently inquired, smiling.\n\n\"Why this man is tipsy,\" remarked Ch'ing Wen sneeringly. \"As you were\ngoing to the other mansion, you told me to stick them over the door. I\nwas afraid lest any one else should spoil them, as they were being\npasted, so I climbed up a high ladder and was ever so long in putting\nthem up myself; my hands are even now numb with cold.\"\n\n\"Oh I forgot all about it,\" replied Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc grinning, \"if your hands are\ncold, come and I'll rub them warm for you.\"\n\nPromptly stretching out his hand, he took those of Ch'ing Wen in his,\nand the two of them looked at the three characters, which he recently\nhad written, and which were pasted above the door. In a short while,\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc came.\n\n\"My dear cousin,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc said to her smilingly, \"tell me without any\nprevarication which of the three characters is the best written?\"\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc raised her head and perceived the three characters: Red, Rue,\nHall. \"They're all well done,\" she rejoined, with a smirk, \"How is it\nyou've written them so well? By and bye you must also write a tablet for\nme.\"\n\n\"Are you again making fun of me?\" asked Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc smiling; \"what about\nsister Hsi Jen?\" he went on to inquire.\n\nCh'ing Wen pouted her lips, pointing towards the stove-couch in the\ninner room, and, on looking in, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc espied Hsi Jen fast asleep in her\ndaily costume.\n\n\"Well,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc observed laughing, \"there's no harm in it, but its rather\nearly to sleep. When I was having my early meal, on the other side,\" he\nproceeded, speaking to Ch'ing Wen, \"there was a small dish of dumplings,\nwith bean-curd outside; and as I thought you would like to have some, I\nasked Mrs. Yu for them, telling her that I would keep them, and eat them\nin the evening; I told some one to bring them over, but have you\nperchance seen them?\"\n\n\"Be quick and drop that subject,\" suggested Ch'ing Wen; \"as soon as they\nwere brought over, I at once knew they were intended for me; as I had\njust finished my meal, I put them by in there, but when nurse Li came\nshe saw them. 'Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc,' she said, 'is not likely to eat them, so I'll\ntake them and give them to my grandson.' And forthwith she bade some one\ntake them over to her home.\"\n\nWhile she was speaking, Hsi Hs\u00c3\u00bceh brought in tea, and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc pressed his\ncousin Lin to have a cup.\n\n\"Miss Lin has gone long ago,\" observed all of them, as they burst out\nlaughing, \"and do you offer her tea?\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc drank about half a cup, when he also suddenly bethought himself\nof some tea, which had been brewed in the morning. \"This morning,\" he\ntherefore inquired of Hsi Hs\u00c3\u00bceh, \"when you made a cup of maple-dew tea,\nI told you that that kind of tea requires brewing three or four times\nbefore its colour appears; and how is that you now again bring me this\ntea?\"\n\n\"I did really put it by,\" answered Hsi Hs\u00c3\u00bceh, \"but nurse Li came and\ndrank it, and then went off.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc upon hearing this, dashed the cup he held in his hand on the\nground, and as it broke into small fragments, with a crash, it spattered\nHsi Hs\u00c3\u00bceh's petticoat all over.\n\n\"Of whose family is she the mistress?\" inquired Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc of Hsi Hs\u00c3\u00bceh, as\nhe jumped up, \"that you all pay such deference to her. I just simply had\na little of her milk, when I was a brat, and that's all; and now she has\ngot into the way of thinking herself more high and mighty than even the\nheads of the family! She should be packed off, and then we shall all\nhave peace and quiet.\"\n\nSaying this, he was bent upon going, there and then, to tell dowager\nlady Chia to have his nurse driven away.\n\nHsi Jen was really not asleep, but simply feigning, with the idea, when\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc came, to startle him in play. At first, when she heard him speak\nof writing, and inquire after the dumplings, she did not think it\nnecessary to get up, but when he flung the tea-cup on the floor, and got\ninto a temper, she promptly jumped up and tried to appease him, and to\nprevent him by coaxing from carrying out his threat.\n\nA waiting-maid sent by dowager lady Chia came in, meanwhile, to ask what\nwas the matter.\n\n\"I had just gone to pour tea,\" replied Hsi Jen, without the least\nhesitation, \"and I slipped on the snow and fell, while the cup dropped\nfrom my hand and broke. Your decision to send her away is good,\" she\nwent on to advise Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"and we are all willing to go also; and why\nnot avail yourself of this opportunity to dismiss us in a body? It will\nbe for our good, and you too on the other hand, needn't perplex yourself\nabout not getting better people to come and wait on you!\"\n\nWhen Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc heard this taunt, he had at length not a word to say, and\nsupported by Hsi Jen and the other attendants on to the couch, they\ndivested him of his clothes. But they failed to understand the drift of\nwhat Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc kept on still muttering, and all they could make out was an\nendless string of words; but his eyes grew heavier and drowsier, and\nthey forthwith waited upon him until he went to sleep; when Hsi Jen\nunclasped the jade of spiritual perception, and rolling it up in a\nhandkerchief, she lay it under the mattress, with the idea that when he\nput it on the next day it should not chill his neck.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc fell sound asleep the moment he lay his head on the pillow. By\nthis time nurse Li and the others had come in, but when they heard that\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc was tipsy, they too did not venture to approach, but gently made\ninquiries as to whether he was asleep or not. On hearing that he was,\nthey took their departure with their minds more at ease.\n\nThe next morning the moment Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc awoke, some one came in to tell him\nthat young Mr. Jung, living in the mansion on the other side, had\nbrought Ch'in Chung to pay him a visit.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc speedily went out to greet them and to take them over to pay\ntheir respects to dowager lady Chia. Her venerable ladyship upon\nperceiving that Ch'in Chung, with his handsome countenance, and his\nrefined manners, would be a fit companion for Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc in his studies,\nfelt extremely delighted at heart; and having readily detained him to\ntea, and kept him to dinner, she went further and directed a servant to\nescort him to see madame Wang and the rest of the family.\n\nWith the fond regard of the whole household for Mrs. Ch'in, they were,\nwhen they saw what a kind of person Ch'in Chung was, so enchanted with\nhim, that at the time of his departure, they all had presents to give\nhim; even dowager lady Chia herself presented him with a purse and a\ngolden image of the God of Learning, with a view that it should incite\nhim to study and harmony.\n\n\"Your house,\" she further advised him, \"is far off, and when it's cold\nor hot, it would be inconvenient for you to come all that way, so you\nhad better come and live over here with me. You'll then be always with\nyour cousin Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, and you won't be together, in your studies, with\nthose fellow-pupils of yours who have no idea what progress means.\"\n\nCh'in Chung made a suitable answer to each one of her remarks, and on\nhis return home he told everything to his father.\n\nHis father, Ch'in Pang-yeh, held at present the post of Secretary in the\nPeking Field Force, and was well-nigh seventy. His wife had died at an\nearly period, and as she left no issue, he adopted a son and a daughter\nfrom a foundling asylum.\n\nBut who would have thought it, the boy also died, and there only\nremained the girl, known as K\u00c3\u00b3 Ch'ing in her infancy, who when she grew\nup, was beautiful in face and graceful in manners, and who by reason of\nsome relationship with the Chia family, was consequently united by the\nties of marriage (to one of the household).\n\nCh'in Pang-yeh was in his fiftieth year when he at length got this son.\nAs his tutor had the previous year left to go south, he remained at home\nkeeping up his former lessons; and (his father) had been just thinking\nof talking over the matter with his relatives of the Chia family, and\nsending his son to the private school, when, as luck would have it, this\nopportunity of meeting Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc presented itself.\n\nKnowing besides that the family school was under the direction of the\nvenerable scholar Chia Tai-ju, and hoping that by joining his class,\n(his son) might advance in knowledge and by these means reap reputation,\nhe was therefore intensely gratified. The only drawbacks were that his\nofficial emoluments were scanty, and that both the eyes of everyone in\nthe other establishment were set upon riches and honours, so that he\ncould not contribute anything short of the amount (given by others); but\nhis son's welfare throughout life was a serious consideration, and he,\nneedless to say, had to scrape together from the East and to collect\nfrom the West; and making a parcel, with all deference, of twenty-four\ntaels for an introduction present, he came along with Ch'in Chung to\nTai-ju's house to pay their respects. But he had to wait subsequently\nuntil Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc could fix on an auspicious date on which they could\ntogether enter the school.\n\nAs for what happened after they came to school, the next chapter will\ndivulge.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n  Chia Cheng gives good advice to his wayward son.\n  Li Kuei receives a reprimand.\n  Chia Jui and Li Kuei rebuke the obstinate youths!\n  Ming Yen causes trouble in the school-room.\n\n\nBut to return to our story. Mr. Ch'in, the father, and Ch'in Chung, his\nson, only waited until the receipt, by the hands of a servant, of a\nletter from the Chia family about the date on which they were to go to\nschool. Indeed, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was only too impatient that he and Ch'in Chung\nshould come together, and, without loss of time, he fixed upon two days\nlater as the day upon which they were definitely to begin their studies,\nand he despatched a servant with a letter to this effect.\n\nOn the day appointed, as soon as it was daylight, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc turned out of\nbed. Hsi Jen had already by that time got books, pencils and all writing\nnecessaries in perfect readiness, and was sitting on the edge of the bed\nin a moping mood; but as soon as she saw Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc approach, she was\nconstrained to wait upon him in his toilette and ablutions.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, noticing how despondent she was, made it a point to address her.\n\"My dear sister,\" he said, \"how is it you aren't again yourself? Is it\nlikely that you bear me a grudge for being about to go to school,\nbecause when I leave you, you'll all feel dull?\"\n\nHsi Jen smiled. \"What an ideal\" she replied. \"Study is a most excellent\nthing, and without it a whole lifetime is a mere waste, and what good\ncomes in the long run? There's only one thing, which is simply that when\nengaged in reading your books, you should set your mind on your books;\nand that you should think of home when not engaged in reading. Whatever\nyou do, don't romp together with them, for were you to meet our master,\nyour father, it will be no joke! Although it's asserted that a scholar\nmust strain every nerve to excel, yet it's preferable that the tasks\nshould be somewhat fewer, as, in the first place, when one eats too\nmuch, one cannot digest it; and, in the second place, good health must\nalso be carefully attended to. This is my view on the subject, and you\nshould at all times consider it in practice.\"\n\nWhile Hsi Jen gave utterance to a sentence, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc nodded his head in\nsign of approval of that sentence. Hsi Jen then went on to speak. \"I've\nalso packed up,\" she continued, \"your long pelisse, and handed it to the\npages to take it over; so mind, when it's cold in the school-room,\nplease remember to put on this extra clothing, for it's not like home,\nwhere you have people to look after you. The foot-stove and hand-stove,\nI've also sent over; and urge that pack of lazy-bones to attend to their\nwork, for if you say nothing, they will be so engrossed in their\nfrolics, that they'll be loth to move, and let you, all for nothing,\ntake a chill and ruin your constitution.\"\n\n\"Compose your mind,\" replied Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc; \"when I go out, I know well enough\nhow to attend to everything my own self. But you people shouldn't remain\nin this room, and mope yourselves to death; and it would be well if you\nwould often go over to cousin Lin's for a romp.\"\n\nWhile saying this, he had completed his toilette, and Hsi Jen pressed\nhim to go and wish good morning to dowager lady Chia, Chia Cheng, madame\nWang, and the other members of the family.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, after having gone on to give a few orders to Ch'ing Wen and She\nYueh, at length left his apartments, and coming over, paid his obeisance\nto dowager lady Chia. Her venerable Ladyship had likewise, as a matter\nof course, a few recommendations to make to him, which ended, he next\nwent and greeted madame Wang; and leaving again her quarters, he came\ninto the library to wish Chia Cheng good morning.\n\nAs it happened, Chia Cheng had on this day returned home at an early\nhour, and was, at this moment, in the library, engaged in a friendly\nchat with a few gentlemen, who were family companions. Suddenly\nperceiving Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc come in to pay his respects, and report that he was\nabout to go to school, Chia Cheng gave a sardonic smile. \"If you do\nagain,\" he remarked, \"make allusions to the words going to school,\nyou'll make even me blush to death with shame! My advice to you is that\nyou should after all go your own way and play; that's the best thing for\nyou; and mind you don't pollute with dirt this floor by standing here,\nand soil this door of mine by leaning against it!\"\n\nThe family companions stood up and smilingly expostulated.\n\n\"Venerable Sir,\" they pleaded, \"why need you be so down upon him? Our\nworthy brother is this day going to school, and may in two or three\nyears be able to display his abilities and establish his reputation. He\nwill, beyond doubt, not behave like a child, as he did in years gone\npast. But as the time for breakfast is also drawing nigh, you should,\nworthy brother, go at once.\"\n\nWhen these words had been spoken, two among them, who were advanced in\nyears, readily took Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc by the hand, and led him out of the library.\n\n\"Who are in attendance upon Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc?\" Chia Cheng having inquired, he\nheard a suitable reply, \"We, Sir!\" given from outside; and three or four\nsturdy fellows entered at an early period and fell on one knee, and\nbowed and paid their obeisance.\n\nWhen Chia Cheng came to scrutinise who they were, and he recognised Li\nKuei, the son of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's nurse, he addressed himself to him. \"You\npeople,\" he said, \"remain waiting upon him the whole day long at school,\nbut what books has he after all read? Books indeed! why, he has read and\nfilled his brains with a lot of trashy words and nonsensical phrases,\nand learnt some ingenious way of waywardness. Wait till I have a little\nleisure, and I'll set to work, first and foremost, and flay your skin\noff, and then settle accounts with that good-for-nothing!\"\n\nThis threat so terrified Li Kuei that he hastily fell on both his knees,\npulled off his hat, knocked his head on the ground, and gave vent to\nrepeated assenting utterances: \"Oh, quite so, Sir! Our elder brother Mr.\nPao has,\" he continued, \"already read up to the third book of the Book\nof Odes, up to where there's something or other like: 'Yiu, Yiu, the\ndeer bleat; the lotus leaves and duckweed.' Your servant wouldn't\npresume to tell a lie!\"\n\nAs he said this, the whole company burst out into a boisterous fit of\nlaughter, and Chia Cheng himself could not also contain his countenance\nand had to laugh. \"Were he even,\" he observed, \"to read thirty books of\nthe Book of Odes, it would be as much an imposition upon people and no\nmore, as (when the thief) who, in order to steal the bell, stops up his\nown ears! You go and present my compliments to the gentleman in the\nschoolroom, and tell him, from my part, that the whole lot of Odes and\nold writings are of no use, as they are subjects for empty show; and\nthat he should, above all things, take the Four Books, and explain them\nto him, from first to last, and make him know them all thoroughly by\nheart,--that this is the most important thing!\"\n\nLi Kuei signified his obedience with all promptitude, and perceiving\nthat Chia Cheng had nothing more to say, he retired out of the room.\n\nDuring this while, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had been standing all alone outside in the\ncourt, waiting quietly with suppressed voice, and when they came out he\nat once walked away in their company.\n\nLi Kuei and his companions observed as they shook their clothes, \"Did\nyou, worthy brother, hear what he said that he would first of all flay\nour skins off! People's servants acquire some respectability from the\nmaster whom they serve, but we poor fellows fruitlessly wait upon you,\nand are beaten and blown up in the bargain. It would be well if we were,\nfrom henceforward, to be treated with a certain amount of regard.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc smiled, \"Dear Brother,\" he added, \"don't feel aggrieved; I'll\ninvite you to come round to-morrow!\"\n\n\"My young ancestor,\" replied Li Kuei, \"who presumes to look forward to\nan invitation? all I entreat you is to listen to one or two words I have\nto say, that's all.\"\n\nAs they talked they came over once more to dowager lady Chia's on this\nside.\n\nCh'in Chung had already arrived, and the old lady was first having a\nchat with him. Forthwith the two of them exchanged salutations, and took\nleave of her ladyship; but Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, suddenly remembering that he had not\nsaid good-bye to Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, promptly betook himself again to Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc's\nquarters to do so.\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc was, at this time, below the window, facing the mirror, and\nadjusting her toilette. Upon hearing Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc mention that he was on his\nway to school, she smiled and remarked, \"That's right! you're now going\nto school and you'll be sure to reach the lunar palace and pluck the\nolea fragrans; but I can't go along with you.\"\n\n\"My dear cousin,\" rejoined Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"wait for me to come out from school,\nbefore you have your evening meal; wait also until I come to prepare the\ncosmetic of rouge.\"\n\nAfter a protracted chat, he at length tore himself away and took his\ndeparture.\n\n\"How is it,\" interposed Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, as she once again called out to him and\nstopped him, \"that you don't go and bid farewell to your cousin Pao\nCh'ai?\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc smiled, and saying not a word by way of reply he straightway\nwalked to school, accompanied by Ch'in Chung.\n\nThis public school, which it must be noticed was also not far from his\nquarters, had been originally instituted by the founder of the\nestablishment, with the idea that should there be among the young\nfellows of his clan any who had not the means to engage a tutor, they\nshould readily be able to enter this class for the prosecution of their\nstudies; that all those of the family who held official position should\nall give (the institution) pecuniary assistance, with a view to meet the\nexpenses necessary for allowances to the students; and that they were to\nselect men advanced in years and possessed of virtue to act as tutors of\nthe family school.\n\nThe two of them, Ch'in Chung and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, had now entered the class, and\nafter they and the whole number of their schoolmates had made each\nother's acquaintance, their studies were commenced. Ever since this\ntime, these two were wont to come together, go together, get up\ntogether, and sit together, till they became more intimate and close.\nBesides, dowager lady Chia got very fond of Ch'in Chung, and would again\nand again keep him to stay with them for three and five days at a time,\ntreating him as if he were one of her own great-grandsons. Perceiving\nthat in Ch'in Chung's home there was not much in the way of sufficiency,\nshe also helped him in clothes and other necessaries; and scarcely had\none or two months elapsed before Ch'in Chung got on friendly terms with\nevery one in the Jung mansion.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc was, however, a human being who could not practise contentment\nand observe propriety; and as his sole delight was to have every caprice\ngratified, he naturally developed a craving disposition. \"We two, you\nand I, are,\" he was also wont secretly to tell Ch'in Chung, \"of the same\nage, and fellow-scholars besides, so that there's no need in the future\nto pay any regard to our relationship of uncle and nephew; and we should\ntreat each other as brothers or friends, that's all.\"\n\nCh'in Chung at first (explained that) he could not be so presumptuous;\nbut as Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc would not listen to any such thing, but went on to address\nhim as brother and to call him by his style Ch'ing Ch'ing, he had\nlikewise himself no help, but to begin calling him, at random, anything\nand anyhow.\n\nThere were, it is true, a large number of pupils in this school, but\nthese consisted of the sons and younger brothers of that same clan, and\nof several sons and nephews of family connections. The proverb\nappositely describes that there are nine species of dragons, and that\neach species differs; and it goes of course without saying that in a\nlarge number of human beings there were dragons and snakes, confusedly\nadmixed, and that creatures of a low standing were included.\n\nEver since the arrival of the two young fellows, Ch'in Chung and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc,\nboth of whom were in appearance as handsome as budding flowers, and\nthey, on the one hand, saw how modest and genial Ch'in Chung was, how he\nblushed before he uttered a word, how he was timid and demure like a\ngirl, and on the other hand, how that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was naturally proficient in\nabasing and demeaning himself, how he was so affable and good-natured,\nconsiderate in his temperament and so full of conversation, and how that\nthese two were, in consequence, on such terms of intimate friendship, it\nwas, in fact, no matter of surprise that the whole company of\nfellow-students began to foster envious thoughts, that they, behind\ntheir backs, passed on their account, this one one disparaging remark\nand that one another, and that they insinuated slanderous lies against\nthem, which extended inside as well as outside the school-room.\n\nIndeed, after Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an had come over to take up his quarters in madame\nWang's suite of apartments, he shortly came to hear of the existence of\na family school, and that this school was mainly attended by young\nfellows of tender years, and inordinate ideas were suddenly aroused in\nhim. While he therefore fictitiously gave out that he went to school,\n[he was as irregular in his attendance as the fisherman] who catches\nfish for three days, and suns his nets for the next two; simply\npresenting his school-fee gift to Chia Tai-jui and making not the least\nprogress in his studies; his sole dream being to knit a number of\nfamiliar friendships. Who would have thought it, there were in this\nschool young pupils, who, in their greed to obtain money, clothes and\neatables from Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an, allowed themselves to be cajoled by him, and\nplayed tricks upon; but on this topic, it is likewise superfluous to\ndilate at any length.\n\nThere were also two lovable young scholars, relatives of what branch of\nthe family is not known, and whose real surnames and names have also not\nbeen ascertained, who, by reason of their good and winsome looks, were,\nby the pupils in the whole class, given two nicknames, to one that of\n\"Hsiang Lin,\" \"Fragrant Love,\" and to the other \"Y\u00c3\u00bc Ai,\" \"Precious\nAffection.\" But although every one entertained feelings of secret\nadmiration for them, and had the wish to take liberties with the young\nfellows, they lived, nevertheless, one and all, in such terror of Hs\u00c3\u00bceh\nP'an's imperious influence, that they had not the courage to come\nforward and interfere with them.\n\nAs soon as Ch'in Chung and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had, at this time, come to school, and\nthey had made the acquaintance of these two fellow-pupils, they too\ncould not help becoming attached to them and admiring them, but as they\nalso came to know that they were great friends of Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an, they did\nnot, in consequence, venture to treat them lightly, or to be unseemly in\ntheir behaviour towards them. Hsiang Lin and Y\u00c3\u00bc Ai both kept to\nthemselves the same feelings, which they fostered for Ch'in Chung and\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, and to this reason is to be assigned the fact that though these\nfour persons nurtured fond thoughts in their hearts there was however no\nvisible sign of them. Day after day, each one of them would, during\nschool hours, sit in four distinct places: but their eight eyes were\nsecretly linked together; and, while indulging either in innuendoes or\nin double entendres, their hearts, in spite of the distance between\nthem, reflected the whole number of their thoughts.\n\nBut though their outward attempts were devoted to evade the detection of\nother people's eyes, it happened again that, while least expected,\nseveral sly lads discovered the real state of affairs, with the result\nthat the whole school stealthily frowned their eyebrows at them, winked\ntheir eyes at them, or coughed at them, or raised their voices at them;\nand these proceedings were, in fact, not restricted to one single day.\n\nAs luck would have it, on this day Tai-jui was, on account of business,\ncompelled to go home; and having left them as a task no more than a\nheptameter line for an antithetical couplet, explaining that they should\nfind a sentence to rhyme, and that the following day when he came back,\nhe would set them their lessons, he went on to hand the affairs\nconnected with the class to his elder grandson, Chia Jui, whom he asked\nto take charge.\n\nWonderful to say Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an had of late not frequented school very\noften, not even so much as to answer the roll, so that Ch'in Chung\navailed himself of his absence to ogle and smirk with Hsiang Lin; and\nthese two pretending that they had to go out, came into the back court\nfor a chat.\n\n\"Does your worthy father at home mind your having any friends?\" Ch'in\nChung was the first to ask. But this sentence was scarcely ended, when\nthey heard a sound of coughing coming from behind. Both were taken much\naback, and, speedily turning their heads round to see, they found that\nit was a fellow-scholar of theirs, called Chin Jung.\n\nHsiang Lin was naturally of somewhat hasty temperament, so that with\nshame and anger mutually impelling each other, he inquired of him,\n\"What's there to cough at? Is it likely you wouldn't have us speak to\neach other?\"\n\n\"I don't mind your speaking,\" Chin Jung observed laughing; \"but would\nyou perchance not have me cough? I'll tell you what, however; if you\nhave anything to say, why not utter it in intelligible language? Were\nyou allowed to go on in this mysterious manner, what strange doings\nwould you be up to? But I have sure enough found you out, so what's the\nneed of still prevaricating? But if you will, first of all, let me\npartake of a share in your little game, you and I can hold our tongue\nand utter not a word. If not, why the whole school will begin to turn\nthe matter over.\"\n\nAt these words, Ch'in Chung and Hsiang Lin were so exasperated that\ntheir blood rushed up to their faces. \"What have you found out?\" they\nhastily asked.\n\n\"What I have now detected,\" replied Chin Jung smiling, \"is the plain\ntruth!\" and saying this he went on to clap his hands and to call out\nwith a loud voice as he laughed: \"They have moulded some nice well-baked\ncakes, won't you fellows come and buy one to eat!\" (These two have been\nup to larks, won't you come and have some fun!)\n\nBoth Ch'in Chung and Hsiang Lin felt resentful as well as fuming with\nrage, and with hurried step they went in, in search of Chia Jui, to whom\nthey reported Chin Jung, explaining that Chin Jung had insulted them\nboth, without any rhyme or reason.\n\nThe fact is that this Chia Jui was, in an extraordinary degree, a man\nwith an eye to the main chance, and devoid of any sense of propriety.\nHis wont was at school to take advantage of public matters to serve his\nprivate interest, and to bring pressure upon his pupils with the intent\nthat they should regale him. While subsequently he also lent his\ncountenance to Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an, scheming to get some money or eatables out of\nhim, he left him entirely free to indulge in disorderly behaviour; and\nnot only did he not go out of his way to hold him in check, but, on the\ncontrary, he encouraged him, infamous though he was already, to become a\nbully, so as to curry favour with him.\n\nBut this Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an was, by nature, gifted with a fickle disposition;\nto-day, he would incline to the east, and to-morrow to the west, so that\nhaving recently obtained new friends, he put Hsiang Lin and Y\u00c3\u00bc Ai aside.\nChin Jung too was at one time an intimate friend of his, but ever since\nhe had acquired the friendship of the two lads, Hsiang Lin and Y\u00c3\u00bc Ai, he\nforthwith deposed Chin Jung. Of late, he had already come to look down\nupon even Hsiang Lin and Y\u00c3\u00bc Ai, with the result that Chia Jui as well\nwas deprived of those who could lend him support, or stand by him; but\nhe bore Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an no grudge, for wearying with old friends, as soon as\nhe found new ones, but felt angry that Hsiang Lin and Y\u00c3\u00bc Ai had not put\nin a word on his behalf with Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an. Chia Jui, Chin Jung and in fact\nthe whole crowd of them were, for this reason, just harbouring a jealous\ngrudge against these two, so that when he saw Ch'in Chung and Hsiang Lin\ncome on this occasion and lodge a complaint against Chin Jung, Chia Jui\nreadily felt displeasure creep into his heart; and, although he did not\nventure to call Ch'in Chung to account, he nevertheless made an example\nof Hsiang Lin. And instead (of taking his part), he called him a\nbusybody and denounced him in much abusive language, with the result\nthat Hsiang Lin did not, contrariwise, profit in any way, but brought\ndispleasure upon himself. Even Ch'in Chung grumbled against the\ntreatment, as each of them resumed their places.\n\nChin Jung became still more haughty, and wagging his head and smacking\nhis lips, he gave vent to many more abusive epithets; but as it happened\nthat they also reached Y\u00c3\u00bc Ai's ears, the two of them, though seated\napart, began an altercation in a loud tone of voice.\n\nChin Jung, with obstinate pertinacity, clung to his version. \"Just a\nshort while back,\" he said, \"I actually came upon them, as they were\nindulging in demonstrations of intimate friendship in the back court.\nThese two had resolved to be one in close friendship, and were eloquent\nin their protestations, mindful only in persistently talking their\ntrash, but they were not aware of the presence of another person.\"\n\nBut his language had, contrary to all expectations, given, from the very\nfirst, umbrage to another person, and who do you, (gentle reader,)\nimagine this person to have been?\n\nThis person was, in fact, one whose name was Chia Se; a grandson\nlikewise of a main branch of the Ning mansion. His parents had died at\nan early period, and he had, ever since his youth, lived with Chia Chen.\nHe had at this time grown to be sixteen years of age, and was, as\ncompared with Chia Jung, still more handsome and good looking. These two\ncousins were united by ties of the closest intimacy, and were always\ntogether, whether they went out or stayed at home.\n\nThe inmates of the Ning mansion were many in number, and their opinions\nof a mixed kind; and that whole bevy of servants, devoid as they were of\nall sense of right, solely excelled in the practice of inventing stories\nto backbite their masters; and this is how some mean person or other\nagain, who it was is not known, insinuated slanderous and opprobrious\nreports (against Chia Se). Chia Chen had, presumably, also come to hear\nsome unfavourable criticisms (on his account), and having, of course, to\nsave himself from odium and suspicion, he had, at this juncture, after\nall, to apportion him separate quarters, and to bid Chia Se move outside\nthe Ning mansion, where he went and established a home of his own to\nlive in.\n\nThis Chia Se was handsome as far as external appearances went, and\nintelligent withal in his inward natural gifts, but, though he nominally\ncame to school, it was simply however as a mere blind; for he treated,\nas he had ever done, as legitimate occupations, such things as cock\nfighting, dog-racing and visiting places of easy virtue. And as, above,\nhe had Chia Chen to spoil him by over-indulgence; and below, there was\nChia Jung to stand by him, who of the clan could consequently presume to\nrun counter to him?\n\nSeeing that he was on the closest terms of friendship with Chia Jung,\nhow could he reconcile himself to the harsh treatment which he now saw\nCh'in Chung receive from some persons? Being now bent upon pushing\nhimself forward to revenge the injustice, he was, for the time, giving\nhimself up to communing with his own heart. \"Chin Jung, Chia Jui and the\nrest are,\" he pondered, \"friends of uncle Hs\u00c3\u00bceh, but I too am on\nfriendly terms with him, and he with me, and if I do come forward and\nthey tell old Hs\u00c3\u00bceh, won't we impair the harmony which exists between\nus? and if I don't concern myself, such idle tales make, when spoken,\nevery one feel uncomfortable; and why shouldn't I now devise some means\nto hold them in check, so as to stop their mouths, and prevent any loss\nof face!\"\n\nHaving concluded this train of thought, he also pretended that he had to\ngo out, and, walking as far as the back, he, with low voice, called to\nhis side Ming Yen, the page attending upon Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc in his studies, and in\none way and another, he made use of several remarks to egg him on.\n\nThis Ming Yen was the smartest of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's attendants, but he was also\nyoung in years and lacked experience, so that he lent a patient ear to\nwhat Chia Se had to say about the way Chin Jung had insulted Ch'in\nChung. \"Even your own master, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc,\" (Chia Se added), \"is involved,\nand if you don't let him know a bit of your mind, he will next time be\nstill more arrogant.\"\n\nThis Ming Yen was always ready, even with no valid excuse, to be\ninsolent and overbearing to people, so that after hearing the news and\nbeing furthermore instigated by Chia Se, he speedily rushed into the\nschoolroom and cried out \"Chin Jung;\" nor did he address him as Mr.\nChin, but merely shouted \"What kind of fellow is this called Chin?\"\n\nChia Se presently shuffled his feet, while he designedly adjusted his\ndress and looked at the rays of the sun. \"It's time,\" he observed and\nwalking forthwith, first up to Chia Jui, he explained to him that he had\nsomething to attend to and would like to get away a little early; and as\nChia Jui did not venture to stop him, he had no alternative but to let\nhim have his way and go.\n\nDuring this while, Ming Yen had entered the room and promptly seizing\nChin Jung in a grip: \"What we do, whether proper or improper,\" he said,\n\"doesn't concern you! It's enough anyway that we don't defile your\nfather! A fine brat you are indeed, to come out and meddle with your Mr.\nMing!\"\n\nThese words plunged the scholars of the whole class in such\nconsternation that they all wistfully and absently looked at him.\n\n\"Ming Yen,\" hastily shouted out Chia Jui, \"you're not to kick up a\nrumpus.\"\n\nChin Jung was so full of anger that his face was quite yellow. \"What a\nsubversion of propriety! a slave and a menial to venture to behave in\nthis manner! I'll just simply speak to your master,\" he exclaimed as he\nreadily pushed his hands off and was about to go and lay hold of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\nto beat him.\n\nCh'in Chung was on the point of turning round to leave the room, when\nwith a sound of 'whiff' which reached him from behind, he at once caught\nsight of a square inkslab come flying that way. Who had thrown it he\ncould not say, but it struck the desk where Chia Lan and Chia Ch\u00c3\u00bcn were\nseated.\n\nThese two, Chia Lan and Chia Ch\u00c3\u00bcn, were also the great-grandsons of a\nclose branch of the Jung mansion. This Chia Ch\u00c3\u00bcn had been left\nfatherless at an early age, and his mother doated upon him in an unusual\nmanner, and it was because at school he was on most friendly terms with\nChia Lan, that these two sat together at the same desk. Who would have\nbelieved that Chia Ch\u00c3\u00bcn would, in spite of being young in years, have\nhad an extremely strong mind, and that he would be mostly up to mischief\nwithout the least fear of any one. He watched with listless eye from his\nseat Chin Jung's friends stealthily assist Chin Jung, as they flung an\ninkslab to strike Ming Yen, but when, as luck would have it, it hit the\nwrong mark, and fell just in front of him, smashing to atoms the\nporcelain inkslab and water bottle, and smudging his whole book with\nink, Chia Ch\u00c3\u00bcn was, of course, much incensed, and hastily gave way to\nabuse. \"You consummate pugnacious criminal rowdies! why, doesn't this\namount to all of you taking a share in the fight!\" And as he uttered\nthis abuse, he too forthwith seized an inkslab, which he was bent upon\nflinging.\n\nChia Lan was one who always tried to avoid trouble, so that he lost no\ntime in pressing down the inkslab, while with all the words his mouth\ncould express, he tried to pacify him, adding \"My dear brother, it's no\nbusiness of yours and mine.\"\n\nChia Ch\u00c3\u00bcn could not repress his resentment; and perceiving that the\ninkslab was held down, he at once laid hold of a box containing books,\nwhich he flung in this direction; but being, after all, short of\nstature, and weak of strength, he was unable to send it anywhere near\nthe mark; so that it dropped instead when it got as far as the desk\nbelonging to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc and Ch'in Chung, while a dreadful crash became\naudible as it fell smash on the table. The books, papers, pencils,\ninkslabs, and other writing materials were all scattered over the whole\ntable; and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's cup besides containing tea was itself broken to\npieces and the tea spilt.\n\nChia Ch\u00c3\u00bcn forthwith jumped forward with the intent of assailing the\nperson who had flung the inkslab at the very moment that Chin Jung took\nhold of a long bamboo pole which was near by; but as the space was\nlimited, and the pupils many, how could he very well brandish a long\nstick? Ming Yen at an early period received a whack, and he shouted\nwildly, \"Don't you fellows yet come to start a fight.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc had, besides, along with him several pages, one of whom was\ncalled Sao Hung, another Ch'u Yo, another Mo Y\u00c3\u00bc. These three were\nnaturally up to every mischief, so that with one voice, bawling\nboisterously, \"You children of doubtful mothers, have you taken up\narms?\" Mo Y\u00c3\u00bc promptly took up the bar of a door; while Sao Hung and Ch'u\nYo both laid hold of horsewhips, and they all rushed forward like a hive\nof bees.\n\nChia Jui was driven to a state of exasperation; now he kept this one in\ncheck, and the next moment he reasoned with another, but who would\nlisten to his words? They followed the bent of their inclinations and\nstirred up a serious disturbance.\n\nOf the whole company of wayward young fellows, some there were who gave\nsly blows for fun's sake; others there were who were not gifted with\nmuch pluck and hid themselves on one side; there were those too who\nstood on the tables, clapping their hands and laughing immoderately,\nshouting out: \"Go at it.\"\n\nThe row was, at this stage, like water bubbling over in a cauldron, when\nseveral elderly servants, like Li Kuei and others, who stood outside,\nheard the uproar commence inside, and one and all came in with all haste\nand united in their efforts to pacify them. Upon asking \"What's the\nmatter?\" the whole bevy of voices shouted out different versions; this\none giving this account, while another again another story. But Li Kuei\ntemporised by rebuking Ming Yen and others, four in all, and packing\nthem off.\n\nCh'in Chung's head had, at an early period, come into contact with Chin\nJung's pole and had had the skin grazed off. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was in the act of\nrubbing it for him, with the overlap of his coat, but realising that the\nwhole lot of them had been hushed up, he forthwith bade Li Kuei collect\nhis books.\n\n\"Bring my horse round,\" he cried; \"I'm going to tell Mr. Chia Tai-ju\nthat we have been insulted. I won't venture to tell him anything else,\nbut (tell him I will) that having come with all propriety and made our\nreport to Mr. Chia Jui, Mr. Chia Jui instead (of helping us) threw the\nfault upon our shoulders. That while he heard people abuse us, he went\nso far as to instigate them to beat us; that Ming Yen seeing others\ninsult us, did naturally take our part; but that they, instead (of\ndesisting,) combined together and struck Ming Yen and even broke open\nCh'in Chung's head. And that how is it possible for us to continue our\nstudies in here?\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" replied Li Kuei coaxingly, \"don't be so impatient! As Mr.\nChia Tai-ju has had something to attend to and gone home, were you now,\nfor a trifle like this, to go and disturb that aged gentleman, it will\nmake us, indeed, appear as if we had no sense of propriety: my idea is\nthat wherever a thing takes place, there should it be settled; and\nwhat's the need of going and troubling an old man like him. This is all\nyou, Mr. Chia Jui, who is to blame; for in the absence of Mr. Chia\nTai-ju, you, sir, are the head in this school, and every one looks to\nyou to take action. Had all the pupils been at fault, those who deserved\na beating should have been beaten, and those who merited punishment\nshould have been punished! and why did you wait until things came to\nsuch a pass, and didn't even exercise any check?\"\n\n\"I blew them up,\" pleaded Chia Jui, \"but not one of them would listen.\"\n\n\"I'll speak out, whether you, worthy sir, resent what I'm going to say\nor not,\" ventured Li Kuei. \"It's you, sir, who all along have after all\nhad considerable blame attached to your name; that's why all these young\nmen wouldn't hear you! Now if this affair is bruited, until it reaches\nMr. Chia Tai-ju's ears, why even you, sir, will not be able to escape\ncondemnation; and why don't you at once make up your mind to disentangle\nthe ravelled mess and dispel all trouble and have done with it!\"\n\n\"Disentangle what?\" inquired Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc; \"I shall certainly go and make my\nreport.\"\n\n\"If Chin Jung stays here,\" interposed Ch'in Chung sobbing, \"I mean to go\nback home.\"\n\n\"Why that?\" asked Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. \"Is it likely that others can safely come and\nthat you and I can't? I feel it my bounden duty to tell every one\neverything at home so as to expel Chin Jung. This Chin Jung,\" he went on\nto inquire as he turned towards Lei Kuei, \"is the relative or friend of\nwhat branch of the family?\"\n\nLi Kuei gave way to reflection and then said by way of reply: \"There's\nno need whatever for you to raise this question; for were you to go and\nreport the matter to the branch of the family to which he belongs, the\nharmony which should exist between cousins will be still more impaired.\"\n\n\"He's the nephew of Mrs. Huang, of the Eastern mansion,\" interposed Ming\nYen from outside the window. \"What a determined and self-confident\nfellow he must be to even come and bully us; Mrs. Huang is his paternal\naunt! That mother of yours is only good for tossing about like a\nmillstone, for kneeling before our lady Lien, and begging for something\nto pawn. I've no eye for such a specimen of mistress.\"\n\n\"What!\" speedily shouted Li Kuei, \"does this son of a dog happen to know\nof the existence of all these gnawing maggots?\" (these disparaging\nfacts).\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc gave a sardonic smile. \"I was wondering whose relative he was,\"\nhe remarked; \"is he really sister-in-law Huang's nephew? well, I'll go\nat once and speak to her.\"\n\nAs he uttered these words, his purpose was to start there and then, and\nhe called Ming Yen in, to come and pack up his books. Ming Yen walked in\nand put the books away. \"Master,\" he went on to suggest, in an exultant\nmanner, \"there's no need for you to go yourself to see her; I'll go to\nher house and tell her that our old lady has something to ask of her. I\ncan hire a carriage to bring her over, and then, in the presence of her\nvenerable ladyship, she can be spoken to; and won't this way save a lot\nof trouble?\"\n\n\"Do you want to die?\" speedily shouted Li Kuei; \"mind, when you go back,\nwhether right or wrong, I'll first give you a good bumping, and then go\nand report you to our master and mistress, and just tell them that it's\nyou, and only you, who instigated Mr. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc! I've succeeded, after ever\nso much trouble, in coaxing them, and mending matters to a certain\nextent, and now you come again to continue a new plan. It's you who\nstirred up this row in the school-room; and not to speak of your\nfinding, as would have been the proper course, some way of suppressing\nit, there you are instead still jumping into the fire.\"\n\nMing Yen, at this juncture, could not muster the courage to utter a\nsound. By this time Chia Jui had also apprehended that if the row came\nto be beyond clearing up, he himself would likewise not be clear of\nblame, so that circumstances compelled him to pocket his grievances and\nto come and entreat Ch'in Chung as well as to make apologies to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc.\nThese two young fellows would not at first listen to his advances, but\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc at length explained that he would not go and report the\noccurrence, provided only Chin Jung admitted his being in the wrong.\nChin Jung refused, at the outset, to agree to this, but he ultimately\ncould find no way out of it, as Chia Jui himself urged him to make some\ntemporising apology.\n\nLi Kuei and the others felt compelled to tender Chin Jung some good\nadvice: \"It's you,\" they said, \"who have given rise to the disturbance,\nand if you don't act in this manner, how will the matter ever be brought\nto an end?\" so that Chin Jung found it difficult to persist in his\nobstinacy, and was constrained to make a bow to Ch'in Chung.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc was, however, not yet satisfied, but would insist upon his\nknocking his head on the ground, and Chia Jui, whose sole aim was to\ntemporarily smother the affair, quietly again urged Chin Jung, adding\nthat the proverb has it: \"That if you keep down the anger of a minute,\nyou will for a whole life-time feel no remorse.\"\n\nWhether Chin Jung complied or not to his advice is not known, but the\nfollowing chapter will explain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n  Widow Chin, prompted by a desire to reap advantage, puts up\n      temporarily with an insult.\n  Dr. Chang in discussing Mrs. Chin's illness minutely exhausts its\n      origin.\n\n\nWe will now resume our story. As the persons against Chin Jung were so\nmany and their pressure so great, and as, what was more, Chia Jui urged\nhim to make amends, he had to knock his head on the ground before Ch'in\nChung. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc then gave up his clamorous remonstrances and the whole\ncrowd dispersed from school.\n\nChin Jung himself returned home all alone, but the more he pondered on\nthe occurrence, the more incensed he felt. \"Ch'in Chung,\" he argued, \"is\nsimply Chia Jung's young brother-in-law, and is no son or grandson of\nthe Chia family, and he too joins the class and prosecutes his studies\non no other footing than that of mine; but it's because he relies upon\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc's friendship for him that he has no eye for any one. This being\nthe case, he should be somewhat proper in his behaviour, and there would\nbe then not a word to say about it! He has besides all along been very\nmystical with Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, imagining that we are all blind, and have no eyes\nto see what's up! Here he goes again to-day and mixes with people in\nillicit intrigues; and it's all because they happened to obtrude\nthemselves before my very eyes that this rumpus has broken out; but of\nwhat need I fear?\"\n\nHis mother, n\u00c3\u00a9e Hu, hearing him mutter; \"Why meddle again,\" she\nexplained, \"in things that don't concern you? I had endless trouble in\ngetting to speak to your paternal aunt; and your aunt had, on the other\nhand, a thousand and one ways and means to devise, before she could\nappeal to lady Secunda, of the Western mansion; and then only it was\nthat you got this place to study in. Had we not others to depend upon\nfor your studies, would we have in our house the means sufficient to\nengage a teacher? Besides, in other people's school, tea and eatables\nare all ready and found; and these two years that you've been there for\nyour lessons, we've likewise effected at home a great saving in what\nwould otherwise have been necessary for your eating and use. Something\nhas been, it's true, economised; but you have further a liking for spick\nand span clothes. Besides, it's only through your being there to study,\nthat you've come to know Mr. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh! that Mr. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh, who has even in one\nyear given us so much pecuniary assistance as seventy and eighty taels!\nAnd now you would go and raise a row in this school-room! why, if we\nwere bent upon finding such another place, I tell you plainly, and once\nfor all, that we would find it more difficult than if we tried to scale\nthe heavens! Now do quietly play for a while, and then go to sleep, and\nyou'll be ever so much better for it then.\"\n\nChin Jung thereupon stifled his anger and held his tongue; and, after a\nshort while, he in fact went to sleep of his own accord.\n\nThe next day he again went to school, and no further comment need be\nmade about it; but we will go on to explain that a young lady related to\nher had at one time been given in marriage to a descendant (of the\neldest branch) of the Chia family, (whose names were written) with the\njade radical, Chia Huang by name; but how could the whole number of\nmembers of the clan equal in affluence and power the two mansions of\nNing and Jung? This fact goes, as a matter of course, without saying.\nThe Chia Huang couple enjoyed some small income; but they also went, on\nfrequent occasions, to the mansions of Ning and Jung to pay their\nrespects; and they knew likewise so well how to adulate lady Feng and\nMrs. Yu, that lady Feng and Mrs. Yu would often grant them that\nassistance and support which afforded them the means of meeting their\ndaily expenses.\n\nIt just occurred on this occasion that the weather was clear and fine,\nand that there happened, on the other hand, to be nothing to attend to\nat home, so forthwith taking along with her a matron, (Mrs. Chia Huang)\ngot into a carriage and came over to see widow Chin and her nephew.\nWhile engaged in a chat, Chin Jung's mother accidentally broached the\nsubject of the affair, which had transpired in the school-room of the\nChia mansion on the previous day, and she gave, for the benefit of her\nyoung sister-in-law, a detailed account of the whole occurrence from\nbeginning to end.\n\nThis Mrs. Huang would not have had her temper ruffled had she not come\nto hear what had happened; but having heard about it, anger sprung from\nthe very depths of her heart. \"This fellow, Ch'in Chung,\" she exclaimed,\n\"is a relative of the Chia family, but is it likely that Jung Erh isn't,\nin like manner, a relative of the Chia family; and when relatives are\nmany, there's no need to put on airs! Besides, does his conduct consist,\nfor the most part, of anything that would make one get any face? In\nfact, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc himself shouldn't do injury to himself by condescending to\nlook at him. But, as things have come to this pass, give me time and\nI'll go to the Eastern mansion and see our lady Chen and then have a\nchat with Ch'in Chung's sister, and ask her to decide who's right and\nwho's wrong!\"\n\nChin Jung's mother upon hearing these words was terribly distressed.\n\"It's all through my hasty tongue,\" she observed with vehemence, \"that\nI've told you all, sister-in-law: but please, sister, give up at once\nthe idea of going over to say anything about it! Don't trouble yourself\nas to who is in the right, and who is in the wrong; for were any\nunpleasantness to come out of it, how could we here stand on our legs?\nand were we not to stand on our legs, not only would we never be able to\nengage a tutor, but the result will be, on the contrary, that for his\nown person will be superadded many an expense for eatables and\nnecessaries.\"\n\n\"What do I care about how many?\" replied Mrs. Huang; \"wait till I've\nspoken about it, and we'll see what will be the result.\" Nor would she\naccede to her sister-in-law's entreaties, but bidding, at the same time,\nthe matron look after the carriage, she got into it, and came over to\nthe Ning Mansion.\n\nOn her arrival at the Ning Mansion, she entered by the eastern side\ngate, and dismounting from the carriage, she went in to call on Mrs. Yu,\nthe spouse of Chia Chen, with whom she had not the courage to put on any\nhigh airs; but gently and quietly she made inquiries after her health,\nand after passing some irrelevant remarks, she ascertained: \"How is it I\ndon't see lady Jung to-day?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Mrs. Yu, \"what's the matter with her these last\nfew days; but she hasn't been herself for two months and more; and the\ndoctor who was asked to see her declares that it is nothing connected\nwith any happy event. A couple of days back, she felt, as soon as the\nafternoon came, both to move, and both even to utter a word; while the\nbrightness of her eyes was all dimmed; and I told her, 'You needn't\nstick to etiquette, for there's no use for you to come in the forenoon\nand evening, as required by conventionalities; but what you must do is,\nto look after your own health. Should any relative come over, there's\nalso myself to receive them; and should any of the senior generation\nthink your absence strange, I'll explain things for you, if you'll let\nme.'\n\n\"I also advised brother Jung on the subject: 'You shouldn't,' I said,\n'allow any one to trouble her; nor let her be put out of temper, but let\nher quietly attend to her health, and she'll get all right. Should she\nfancy anything to eat, just come over here and fetch it; for, in the\nevent of anything happening to her, were you to try and find another\nsuch a wife to wed, with such a face and such a disposition, why, I\nfear, were you even to seek with a lantern in hand, there would really\nbe no place where you could discover her. And with such a temperament\nand deportment as hers, which of our relatives and which of our elders\ndon't love her?' That's why my heart has been very distressed these two\ndays! As luck would have it early this morning her brother turned up to\nsee her, but who would have fancied him to be such a child, and so\nignorant of what is proper and not proper to do? He saw well enough that\nhis sister was not well; and what's more all these matters shouldn't\nhave been recounted to her; for even supposing he had received the\ngravest offences imaginable, it behoved him anyhow not to have broached\nthe subject to her! Yesterday, one would scarcely believe it, a fight\noccurred in the school-room, and some pupil or other who attends that\nclass, somehow insulted him; besides, in this business, there were a\ngood many indecent and improper utterances, but all these he went and\ntold his sister! Now, sister-in-law, you are well aware that though (our\nson Jung's) wife talks and laughs when she sees people, that she is\nnevertheless imaginative and withal too sensitive, so that no matter\nwhat she hears, she's for the most part bound to brood over it for three\ndays and five nights, before she loses sight of it, and it's from this\nexcessive sensitiveness that this complaint of hers arises. Today, when\nshe heard that some one had insulted her brother, she felt both vexed\nand angry; vexed that those fox-like, cur-like friends of his had moved\nright and wrong, and intrigued with this one and deluded that one; angry\nthat her brother had, by not learning anything profitable, and not\nhaving his mind set upon study, been the means of bringing about a row\nat school; and on account of this affair, she was so upset that she did\nnot even have her early meal. I went over a short while back and\nconsoled her for a time, and likewise gave her brother a few words of\nadvice; and after having packed off that brother of hers to the mansion\non the other side, in search of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, and having stood by and seen her\nhave half a bowl of birds' nests soup, I at length came over. Now,\nsister-in-law, tell me, is my heart sore or not? Besides, as there's\nnowadays no good doctor, the mere thought of her complaint makes my\nheart feel as if it were actually pricked with needles! But do you and\nyours, perchance, know of any good practitioner?\"\n\nMrs. Chin had, while listening to these words, been, at an early period,\nso filled with concern that she cast away to distant lands the reckless\nrage she had been in recently while at her sister-in-law's house, when\nshe had determined to go and discuss matters over with Mrs. Ch'in. Upon\nhearing Mrs. Yu inquire of her about a good doctor, she lost no time in\nsaying by way of reply: \"Neither have we heard of any one speak of a\ngood doctor; but from the account I've just heard of Mrs. Ch'in's\nillness, it may still, there's no saying, be some felicitous ailment;\nso, sister-in-law, don't let any one treat her recklessly, for were she\nto be treated for the wrong thing, the result may be dreadful!\"\n\n\"Quite so!\" replied Mrs. Yu.\n\nBut while they were talking, Chia Chen came in from out of doors, and\nupon catching sight of Mrs. Chin; \"Isn't this Mrs. Huang?\" he inquired\nof Mrs. Yu; whereupon Mrs. Chin came forward and paid her respects to\nChia Chen.\n\n\"Invite this lady to have her repast here before she goes,\" observed\nChia Chen to Mrs. Yu; and as he uttered these words he forthwith walked\ninto the room on the off side.\n\nThe object of Mrs. Chin's present visit had originally been to talk to\nMrs. Ch'in about the insult which her brother had received from the\nhands of Ch'in Chung, but when she heard that Mrs. Ch'in was ill, she\ndid not have the courage to even so much as make mention of the object\nof her errand. Besides, as Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu had given her a most\ncordial reception, her resentment was transformed into pleasure, so that\nafter a while spent in a further chat about one thing and another, she\nat length returned to her home.\n\nIt was only after the departure of Mrs. Chin that Chia Chen came over\nand took a seat. \"What did she have to say for herself during this visit\nto-day?\" he asked of Mrs. Yu.\n\n\"She said nothing much,\" replied Mrs. Yu. \"When she first entered the\nroom, her face bore somewhat of an angry look, but, after a lengthy chat\nand as soon as mention of our son's wife's illness was made, this\nangered look after all gradually abated. You also asked me to keep her\nfor the repast, but, having heard that our son's wife was so ill she\ncould not very well stay, so that all she did was to sit down, and after\nmaking a few more irrelevant remarks, she took her departure. But she\nhad no request to make. To return however now to the illness of Jung's\nwife, it's urgent that you should find somewhere a good doctor to\ndiagnose it for her; and whatever you do, you should lose no time. The\nwhole body of doctors who at present go in and out of our household, are\nthey worth having? Each one of them listens to what the patient has to\nsay of the ailment, and then, adding a string of flowery sentences, out\nhe comes with a long rigmarole; but they are exceedingly diligent in\npaying us visits; and in one day, three or four of them are here at\nleast four and five times in rotation! They come and feel her pulse,\nthey hold consultation together, and write their prescriptions, but,\nthough she has taken their medicines, she has seen no improvement; on\nthe contrary, she's compelled to change her clothes three and five times\neach day, and to sit up to see the doctor; a thing which, in fact, does\nthe patient no good.\"\n\n\"This child too is somewhat simple,\" observed Chia Chen; \"for what need\nhas she to be taking off her clothes, and changing them for others? And\nwere she again to catch a chill, she would add something more to her\nillness; and won't it be dreadful! The clothes may be no matter how\nfine, but what is their worth, after all? The health of our child is\nwhat is important to look to! and were she even to wear out a suit of\nnew clothes a-day, what would that too amount to? I was about to tell\nyou that a short while back, Feng Tzu-ying came to see me, and,\nperceiving that I had somewhat of a worried look, he asked me what was\nup; and I told him that our son's wife was not well at all, that as we\ncouldn't get any good doctor, we couldn't determine with any certainty,\nwhether she was in an interesting condition, or whether she was\nsuffering from some disease; that as we could neither tell whether there\nwas any danger or not, my heart was, for this reason, really very much\ndistressed. Feng Tzu-ying then explained that he knew a young doctor who\nhad made a study of his profession, Chang by surname, and Yu-shih by\nname, whose learning was profound to a degree; who was besides most\nproficient in the principles of medicine, and had the knack of\ndiscriminating whether a patient would live or die; that this year he\nhad come to the capital to purchase an official rank for his son, and\nthat he was now living with him in his house. In view of these\ncircumstances, not knowing but that if, perchance, the case of our\ndaughter-in-law were placed in his hands, he couldn't avert the danger,\nI readily despatched a servant, with a card of mine, to invite him to\ncome; but the hour to-day being rather late, he probably won't be round,\nbut I believe he's sure to be here to-morrow. Besides, Feng-Tzu-ying was\nalso on his return home, to personally entreat him on my behalf, so that\nhe's bound, when he has asked him, to come and see her. Let's therefore\nwait till Dr. Chang has been here and seen her, when we can talk matters\nover!\"\n\nMrs. Yu was very much cheered when she heard what was said. \"The day\nafter to-morrow,\" she felt obliged to add, \"is again our senior's, Mr.\nChia Ching's birthday, and how are we to celebrate it after all?\"\n\n\"I've just been over to our Senior's and paid my respects,\" replied Chia\nChen, \"and further invited the old gentleman to come home, and receive\nthe congratulations of the whole family.\n\n\"'I'm accustomed,' our Senior explained, 'to peace and quiet, and have\nno wish to go over to that worldly place of yours; for you people are\ncertain to have published that it's my birthday, and to entertain the\ndesign to ask me to go round to receive the bows of the whole lot of\nyou. But won't it be better if you were to give the \"Record of\nMeritorious Acts,\" which I annotated some time ago, to some one to copy\nout clean for me, and have it printed? Compared with asking me to come,\nand uselessly receive the obeisances of you all, this will be yea even a\nhundred times more profitable! In the event of the whole family wishing\nto pay me a visit on any of the two days, to-morrow or the day after\nto-morrow, if you were to stay at home and entertain them in proper\nstyle, that will be all that is wanted; nor will there be any need to\nsend me anything! Even you needn't come two days from this; and should\nyou not feel contented at heart, well, you had better bow your head\nbefore me to-day before you go. But if you do come again the day after\nto-morrow, with a lot of people to disturb me, I shall certainly be\nangry with you.' After what he said, I will not venture to go and see\nhim two days hence; but you had better send for Lai Sheng, and bid him\nget ready a banquet to continue for a couple of days.\"\n\nMrs. Yu, having asked Chia Jung to come round, told him to direct Lai\nSheng to make the usual necessary preparations for a banquet to last for\na couple of days, with due regard to a profuse and sumptuous style.\n\n\"You go by-and-by,\" (she advised him), \"in person to the Western Mansion\nand invite dowager lady Chia, mesdames Hsing and Wang, and your\nsister-in-law Secunda lady Lien to come over for a stroll. Your father\nhas also heard of a good doctor, and having already sent some one to ask\nhim round, I think that by to-morrow he's sure to come; and you had\nbetter tell him, in a minute manner, the serious symptoms of her ailment\nduring these few days.\"\n\nChia Jung having signified his obedience to each of her recommendations,\nand taken his leave, was just in time to meet the youth coming back from\nFeng Tzu-ying's house, whither he had gone a short while back to invite\nthe doctor round.\n\n\"Your slave,\" he consequently reported, \"has just been with a card of\nmaster's to Mr. Feng's house and asked the doctor to come. 'The gentleman\nhere,' replied the doctor, 'has just told me about it; but to-day, I've\nhad to call on people the whole day, and I've only this moment come\nhome; and I feel now my strength (so worn out), that I couldn't really\nstand any exertion. In fact were I even to get as far as the mansion, I\nshouldn't be in a fit state to diagnose the pulses! I must therefore\nhave a night's rest, but, to-morrow for certain, I shall come to the\nmansion. My medical knowledge,' he went on to observe, 'is very shallow,\nand I don't deserve the honour of such eminent recommendation; but as\nMr. Feng has already thus spoken of me in your mansion, I can't but\npresent myself. It will be all right if in anticipation you deliver this\nmessage for me to your honourable master; but as for your worthy\nmaster's card, I cannot really presume to keep it.' It was again at his\ninstance that I've brought it back; but, Sir, please mention this result\nfor me (to master).\"\n\nChia Jung turned back again, and entering the house delivered the\nmessage to Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu; whereupon he walked out, and, calling\nLai Sheng before him, he transmitted to him the orders to prepare the\nbanquet for a couple of days.\n\nAfter Lai Sheng had listened to the directions, he went off, of course,\nto get ready the customary preparations; but upon these we shall not\ndilate, but confine ourselves to the next day.\n\nAt noon, a servant on duty at the gate announced that the Doctor Chang,\nwho had been sent for, had come, and Chia Chen conducted him along the\nCourt into the large reception Hall, where they sat down; and after they\nhad partaken of tea, he broached the subject.\n\n\"Yesterday,\" he explained, \"the estimable Mr. Feng did me the honour to\nspeak to me of your character and proficiency, venerable doctor, as well\nas of your thorough knowledge of medicine, and I, your mean brother, was\nfilled with an immeasurable sense of admiration!\"\n\n\"Your Junior,\" remonstrated Dr. Chang, \"is a coarse, despicable and mean\nscholar and my knowledge is shallow and vile! but as worthy Mr. Feng did\nme the honour yesterday of telling me that your family, sir, had\ncondescended to look upon me, a low scholar, and to favour me too with\nan invitation, could I presume not to obey your commands? But as I\ncannot boast of the least particle of real learning, I feel overburdened\nwith shame!\"\n\n\"Why need you be so modest?\" observed Chia Chen; \"Doctor, do please walk\nin at once to see our son's wife, for I look up, with full reliance, to\nyour lofty intelligence to dispel my solicitude!\"\n\nChia Jung forthwith walked in with him. When they reached the inner\napartment, and he caught sight of Mrs. Ch'in, he turned round and asked\nChia Jung, \"This is your honourable spouse, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is,\" assented Chia Jung; \"but please, Doctor, take a seat, and\nlet me tell you the symptoms of my humble wife's ailment, before her\npulse be felt. Will this do?\"\n\n\"My mean idea is,\" remarked the Doctor, \"that it would, after all, be\nbetter that I should begin by feeling her pulse, before I ask you to\ninform me what the source of the ailment is. This is the first visit I\npay to your honourable mansion; besides, I possess no knowledge of\nanything; but as our worthy Mr. Feng would insist upon my coming over to\nsee you, I had in consequence no alternative but to come. After I have\nnow made a diagnosis, you can judge whether what I say is right or not,\nbefore you explain to me the phases of the complaint during the last few\ndays, and we can deliberate together upon some prescription; as to the\nsuitableness or unsuitableness of which your honourable father will then\nhave to decide, and what is necessary will have been done.\"\n\n\"Doctor,\" rejoined Chia Jung, \"you are indeed eminently clear sighted;\nall I regret at present is that we have met so late! But please, Doctor,\ndiagnose the state of the pulse, so as to find out whether there be hope\nof a cure or not; if a cure can be effected, it will be the means of\nallaying the solicitude of my father and mother.\"\n\nThe married women attached to that menage forthwith presented a pillow;\nand as it was being put down for Mrs. Ch'in to rest her arm on, they\nraised the lower part of her sleeve so as to leave her wrist exposed.\nThe Doctor thereupon put out his hand and pressed it on the pulse of the\nright hand. Regulating his breath (to the pulsation) so as to be able to\ncount the beatings, he with due care and minuteness felt the action for\na considerable time, when, substituting the left hand, he again went\nthrough the same operation.\n\n\"Let us go and sit outside,\" he suggested, after he had concluded\nfeeling her pulses. Chia Jung readily adjourned, in company with the\nDoctor, to the outer apartment, where they seated themselves on the\nstove-couch. A matron having served tea; \"Please take a cup of tea,\ndoctor,\" Chia Jung observed. When tea was over, \"Judging,\" he inquired,\n\"Doctor, from the present action of the pulses, is there any remedy or\nnot?\"\n\n\"The action of the pulse, under the forefinger, on the left hand of your\nhonorable spouse,\" proceeded the Doctor, \"is deep and agitated; the left\nhand pulse, under the second finger, is deep and faint. The pulse, under\nthe forefinger, of the right hand, is gentle and lacks vitality. The\nright hand pulse, under my second finger, is superficial, and has lost\nall energy. The deep and agitated beating of the forepulse of the left\nhand arises from the febrile state, due to the weak action of the heart.\nThe deep and delicate condition of the second part of the pulse of the\nleft wrist, emanates from the sluggishness of the liver, and the\nscarcity of the blood in that organ. The action of the forefinger pulse,\nof the right wrist, is faint and lacks strength, as the breathing of the\nlungs is too weak. The second finger pulse of the right wrist is\nsuperficial and devoid of vigour, as the spleen must be affected\ninjuriously by the liver. The weak action of the heart, and its febrile\nstate, should be the natural causes which conduce to the present\nirregularity in the catamenia, and insomnia at night; the poverty of\nblood in the liver, and the sluggish condition of that organ must\nnecessarily produce pain in the ribs; while the overdue of the\ncatamenia, the cardiac fever, and debility of the respiration of the\nlungs, should occasion frequent giddiness in the head, and swimming of\nthe eyes, the certain recurrence of perspiration between the periods of\n3 to 5 and 5 to 7, and the sensation of being seated on board ship. The\nobstruction of the spleen by the liver should naturally create distaste\nfor liquid or food, debility of the vital energies and prostration of\nthe four limbs. From my diagnosis of these pulses, there should exist\nthese various symptoms, before (the pulses and the symptoms can be said)\nto harmonise. But should perchance (any doctor maintain) that this state\nof the pulses imports a felicitous event, your servant will not presume\nto give an ear to such an opinion!\"\n\nA matron, who was attached as a personal attendant (to Mrs. Ch'in,) and\nwho happened to be standing by interposed: \"How could it be otherwise?\"\nshe ventured. \"In real truth, Doctor, you speak like a supernatural\nbeing, and there's verily no need for us to say anything! We have now,\nready at hand, in our household, a good number of medical gentlemen, who\nare in attendance upon her, but none of these are proficient enough to\nspeak in this positive manner. Some there are who say that it's a\ngenital complaint; others maintain that it's an organic disease. This\ndoctor explains that there is no danger: while another, again, holds\nthat there's fear of a crisis either before or after the winter\nsolstice; but there is, in one word, nothing certain said by them. May\nit please you, sir, now to favour us with your clear directions.\"\n\n\"This complaint of your lady's,\" observed the Doctor, \"has certainly\nbeen neglected by the whole number of doctors; for had a treatment with\ncertain medicines been initiated at the time of the first occurrence of\nher habitual sickness, I cannot but opine that, by this time, a perfect\ncure would have been effected. But seeing that the organic complaint has\nnow been, through neglect, allowed to reach this phase, this calamity\nwas, in truth, inevitable. My ideas are that this illness stands, as\nyet, a certain chance of recovery, (three chances out of ten); but we\nwill see how she gets on, after she has had these medicines of mine.\nShould they prove productive of sleep at night, then there will be added\nfurthermore two more chances in the grip of our hands. From my\ndiagnosis, your lady is a person, gifted with a pre\u00c3\u00abminently excellent,\nand intelligent disposition; but an excessive degree of intelligence is\nthe cause of frequent contrarieties; and frequent contrarieties give\norigin to an excessive amount of anxious cares. This illness arises from\nthe injury done, by worrying and fretting, to the spleen, and from the\ninordinate vigour of the liver; hence it is that the relief cannot come\nat the proper time and season. Has not your lady, may I ask, heretofore\nat the period of the catamenia, suffered, if indeed not from anaemia,\nthen necessarily from plethora? Am I right in assuming this or not?\"\n\n\"To be sure she did,\" replied the matron; \"but she has never been\nsubject to anaemia, but to a plethora, varying from either two to three\ndays, and extending, with much irregularity, to even ten days.\"\n\n\"Quite so!\" observed the Doctor, after hearing what she had to say, \"and\nthis is the source of this organic illness! Had it in past days been\ntreated with such medicine as could strengthen the heart, and improve\nthe respiration, would it have reached this stage? This has now overtly\nmade itself manifest in an ailment originating from the paucity of water\nand the vigour of fire; but let me make use of some medicines, and we'll\nsee how she gets on!\"\n\nThere and then he set to work and wrote a prescription, which he handed\nto Chia Jung, the purpose of which was: Decoction for the improvement of\nrespiration, the betterment of the blood, and the restoration of the\nspleen. Ginseng, Atractylodes Lancea; Yunnan root; Prepared Ti root;\nAralia edulis; Peony roots; Levisticum from Sze Ch'uan; Sophora\ntormentosa; Cyperus rotundus, prepared with rice; Gentian, soaked in\nvinegar; Huai Shan Yao root; Real \"O\" glue; Carydalis Ambigua; and Dried\nliquorice. Seven Fukien lotus seeds, (the cores of which should be\nextracted,) and two large zizyphi to be used as a preparative.\n\n\"What exalted intelligence!\" Chia Jung, after perusing it, exclaimed.\n\"But I would also ask you, Doctor, to be good enough to tell me whether\nthis illness will, in the long run, endanger her life or not?\"\n\nThe Doctor smiled. \"You, sir, who are endowed with most eminent\nintelligence (are certain to know) that when a human illness has reached\nthis phase, it is not a derangement of a day or of a single night; but\nafter these medicines have been taken, we shall also have to watch the\neffect of the treatment! My humble opinion is that, as far as the winter\nof this year goes, there is no fear; in fact, after the spring equinox,\nI entertain hopes of a complete cure.\"\n\nChia Jung was likewise a person with all his wits about him, so that he\ndid not press any further minute questions.\n\nChia Jung forthwith escorted the Doctor and saw him off, and taking the\nprescription and the diagnosis, he handed them both to Chia Chen for his\nperusal, and in like manner recounted to Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu all that\nhad been said on the subject.\n\n\"The other doctors have hitherto not expressed any opinions as positive\nas this one has done,\" observed Mrs. Yu, addressing herself to Chia\nChen, \"so that the medicines to be used are, I think, surely the right\nones!\"\n\n\"He really isn't a man,\" rejoined Chia Chen, \"accustomed to give much of\nhis time to the practice of medicine, in order to earn rice for his\nsupport: and it's Feng Tzu-ying, who is so friendly with us, who is\nmainly to be thanked for succeeding, after ever so much trouble, in\ninducing him to come. But now that we have this man, the illness of our\nson's wife may, there is no saying, stand a chance of being cured. But\non that prescription of his there is ginseng mentioned, so you had\nbetter make use of that catty of good quality which was bought the other\nday.\"\n\nChia Jung listened until the conversation came to a close, after which\nhe left the room, and bade a servant go and buy the medicines, in order\nthat they should be prepared and administered to Mrs. Ch'in.\n\nWhat was the state of Mrs. Ch'in's illness, after she partook of these\nmedicines, we do not know; but, reader, listen to the explanation given\nin the chapter which follows.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n  In honour of Chia Ching's birthday, a family banquet is spread in the\n      Ning Mansion.\n  At the sight of Hsi-feng, Chia Jui entertains feelings of licentious\n      love.\n\n\nWe will now explain, in continuation of our story, that on the day of\nChia Ching's birthday, Chia Chen began by getting ready luscious\ndelicacies and rare fruits, which he packed in sixteen spacious present\nboxes, and bade Chia Jung take them, along with the servants belonging\nto the household, over to Chia Ching.\n\nTurning round towards Chia Jung: \"Mind,\" he said, \"that you observe\nwhether your grandfather be agreeable or not, before you set to work and\npay your obeisance! 'My father,' tell him, 'has complied with your\ndirections, venerable senior, and not presumed to come over; but he has\nat home ushered the whole company of the members of the family (into\nyour apartments), where they all paid their homage facing the side of\nhonour.'\"\n\nAfter Chia Jung had listened to these injunctions, he speedily led off\nthe family domestics, and took his departure. During this interval, one\nby one arrived the guests. First came Chia Lien and Chia Se, who went to\nsee whether the seats in the various places (were sufficient). \"Is there\nto be any entertainment or not?\" they also inquired.\n\n\"Our master,\" replied the servants, \"had, at one time, intended to\ninvite the venerable Mr. Chia Ching to come and spend this day at home,\nand hadn't for this reason presumed to get up any entertainment. But\nwhen the other day he came to hear that the old gentleman was not\ncoming, he at once gave us orders to go in search of a troupe of young\nactors, as well as a band of musicians, and all these people are now\nengaged making their preparations on the stage in the garden.\"\n\nNext came, in a group, mesdames Hsing and Wang, lady Feng and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc,\nfollowed immediately after by Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu; Mrs. Yu's mother\nhaving already arrived and being in there in advance of her. Salutations\nwere exchanged between the whole company, and they pressed one another\nto take a seat. Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu both handed the tea round.\n\n\"Our venerable lady,\" they explained, as they smiled, \"is a worthy\nsenior; while our father is, on the other hand, only her nephew; so that\non a birthday of a man of his age, we should really not have had the\naudacity to invite her ladyship; but as the weather, at this time, is\ncool, and the chrysanthemums, in the whole garden, are in luxuriant\nblossom, we have requested our venerable ancestor to come for a little\ndistraction, and to see the whole number of her children and\ngrand-children amuse themselves. This was the object we had in view,\nbut, contrary to our expectations, our worthy senior has not again\nconferred upon us the lustre of her countenance.\"\n\nLady Feng did not wait until madame Wang could open her mouth, but took\nthe initiative to reply. \"Our venerable lady,\" she urged, \"had, even so\nlate as yesterday, said that she meant to come; but, in the evening,\nupon seeing brother Pao eating peaches, the mouth of the old lady once\nagain began to water, and after partaking of a little more than the half\nof one, she had, about the fifth watch, to get out of bed two\nconsecutive times, with the result that all the forenoon to-day, she\nfelt her body considerably worn out. She therefore bade me inform our\nworthy senior that it was utterly impossible for her to come to-day;\nadding however that, if there were any delicacies, she fancied a few\nkinds, but that they should be very tender.\"\n\nWhen Chia Chen heard these words, he smiled. \"Our dowager lady,\" he\nreplied, \"is, I argued, so fond of amusement that, if she doesn't come\nto-day, there must, for a certainty, be some valid reason; and that's\nexactly what happens to be the case.\"\n\n\"The other day I heard your eldest sister explain,\" interposed madame\nWang, \"that Chia Jung's wife was anything but well; but what's after all\nthe matter with her?\"\n\n\"She has,\" observed Mrs. Yu, \"contracted this illness verily in a\nstrange manner! Last moon at the time of the mid-autumn festival, she\nwas still well enough to be able to enjoy herself, during half the\nnight, in company with our dowager lady and madame Wang. On her return,\nshe continued in good health, until after the twentieth, when she began\nto feel more and more languid every day, and loth, likewise, to eat\nanything; and this has been going on for well-nigh half a month and\nmore; she hasn't besides been anything like her old self for two\nmonths.\"\n\n\"May she not,\" remarked madame Hsing, taking up the thread of the\nconversation, \"be ailing for some happy event?\"\n\nBut while she was uttering these words, some one from outside announced:\n\"Our senior master, second master and all the gentlemen of the family\nhave come, and are standing in the Reception Hall!\" Whereupon Chia Chen\nand Chia Lien quitted the apartment with hurried step; and during this\nwhile, Mrs. Yu reiterated how that some time ago a doctor had also\nexpressed the opinion that she was ailing for a happy event, but that\nthe previous day, had come a doctor, recommended by Feng Tzu-ying--a\ndoctor, who had from his youth up made medicine his study, and was very\nproficient in the treatment of diseases,--who asserted, after he had\nseen her, that it was no felicitous ailment, but that it was some grave\ncomplaint. \"It was only yesterday,\" (she explained,) \"that he wrote his\nprescription; and all she has had is but one dose, and already to-day\nthe giddiness in the head is considerably better; as regards the other\nsymptoms they have as yet shown no marked improvement.\"\n\n\"I maintain,\" remarked lady Feng, \"that, were she not quite unfit to\nstand the exertion, would she in fact, on a day like this, be unwilling\nto strain every nerve and come round.\"\n\n\"You saw her,\" observed Mrs. Yu, \"on the third in here; how that she\nbore up with a violent effort for ever so long, but it was all because\nof the friendship that exists between you two, that she still longed for\nyour society, and couldn't brook the idea of tearing herself away.\"\n\nWhen lady Feng heard these words, her eyes got quite red, and after a\ntime she at length exclaimed: \"In the Heavens of a sudden come wind and\nrain; while with man, in a day and in a night, woe and weal survene! But\nwith her tender years, if for a complaint like this she were to run any\nrisk, what pleasure is there for any human being to be born and to\nsojourn in the world?\"\n\nShe was just speaking, when Chia Jung walked into the apartment; and\nafter paying his respects to madame Hsing, madame Wang, and lady Feng,\nhe then observed to Mrs. Yu: \"I have just taken over the eatables to our\nvenerable ancestor; and, at the same time, I told him that my father was\nat home waiting upon the senior, and entertaining the junior gentlemen\nof the whole family, and that in compliance with grandfather's orders,\nhe did not presume to go over. The old gentleman was much delighted by\nwhat he heard me say, and having signified that that was all in order,\nbade me tell father and you, mother, to do all you can in your\nattendance upon the senior gentlemen and ladies, enjoining me to\nentertain, with all propriety, my uncles, aunts, and my cousins. He also\nwent on to urge me to press the men to cut, with all despatch, the\nblocks for the Record of Meritorious Deeds, and to print ten thousand\ncopies for distribution. All these messages I have duly delivered to my\nfather, but I must now be quick and go out, so as to send the eatables\nfor the elder as well as for the younger gentlemen of the entire\nhousehold.\"\n\n\"Brother Jung Erh,\" exclaimed lady Feng, \"wait a moment. How is your\nwife getting on? how is she, after all, to-day?\"\n\n\"Not well,\" replied Chia Jung. \"But were you, aunt, on your return to go\nin and see her, you will find out for yourself.\"\n\nChia Jung forthwith left the room. During this interval, Mrs. Yu\naddressed herself to mesdames Hsing and Wang; \"My ladies,\" she asked,\n\"will you have your repast in here, or will you go into the garden for\nit? There are now in the garden some young actors engaged in making\ntheir preparations?\"\n\n\"It's better in here,\" madame Wang remarked, as she turned towards\nmadame Hsing.\n\nMrs. Yu thereupon issued directions to the married women and matrons to\nbe quick in serving the eatables. The servants, in waiting outside the\ndoor, with one voice signified their obedience; and each of them went\noff to fetch what fell to her share. In a short while, the courses were\nall laid out, and Mrs. Yu pressed mesdames Hsing and Wang, as well as\nher mother, into the upper seats; while she, together with lady Feng and\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, sat at a side table.\n\n\"We've come,\" observed mesdames Hsing and Wang, \"with the original idea\nof paying our congratulations to our venerable senior on the occasion of\nhis birthday; and isn't this as if we had come for our own birthdays?\"\n\n\"The old gentleman,\" answered lady Feng, \"is a man fond of a quiet life;\nand as he has already consummated a process of purification, he may well\nbe looked upon as a supernatural being, so that the purpose to which\nyour ladyships have given expression may be considered as manifest to\nhis spirit, upon the very advent of the intention.\"\n\nAs this sentence was uttered the whole company in the room burst out\nlaughing. Mrs. Yu's mother, mesdames Hsing and Wang, and lady Feng\nhaving one and all partaken of the banquet, rinsed their mouths and\nwashed their hands, which over, they expressed a wish to go into the\ngarden.\n\nChia Jung entered the room. \"The senior gentlemen,\" he said to Mrs. Yu,\n\"as well as all my uncles and cousins, have finished their repast; but\nthe elder gentleman Mr. Chia She, who excused himself on the score of\nhaving at home something to attend to, and Mr. Secundus (Chia Cheng),\nwho is not partial to theatrical performances and is always afraid that\npeople will be too boisterous in their entertainments, have both of them\ntaken their departure. The rest of the family gentlemen have been taken\nover by uncle Secundus Mr. Lien, and Mr. Se, to the other side to listen\nto the play. A few moments back Prince Nan An, Prince Tung P'ing, Prince\nHsi Ning, Prince Pei Ching, these four Princes, with Niu, Duke of Chen\nKuo, and five other dukes, six in all, and Shih, Marquis of Chung Ching,\nand other seven, in all eight marquises, sent their messengers with\ntheir cards and presents. I have already told father all about it; but\nbefore I did so, the presents were put away in the counting room, the\nlists of presents were all entered in the book, and the 'received with\nthanks' cards were handed to the respective messengers of the various\nmansions; the men themselves were also tipped in the customary manner,\nand all of them were kept to have something to eat before they went on\ntheir way. But, mother, you should invite the two ladies, your mother\nand my aunt, to go over and sit in the garden.\"\n\n\"Just so!\" observed Mrs. Yu, \"but we've only now finished our repast,\nand were about to go over.\"\n\n\"I wish to tell you, madame,\" interposed lady Feng, \"that I shall go\nfirst and see brother Jung's wife and then come and join you.\"\n\n\"All right,\" replied madame Wang; \"we should all have been fain to have\npaid her a visit, did we not fear lest she should look upon our\ndisturbing her with displeasure, but just tell her that we would like to\nknow how she is getting on!\"\n\n\"My dear sister,\" remarked Mrs. Yu, \"as our son's wife has a ready ear\nfor all you say, do go and cheer her up, (and if you do so,) it will\nbesides set my own mind at ease; but be quick and come as soon as you\ncan into the garden.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc being likewise desirous to go along with lady Feng to see lady\nCh'in, madame Wang remarked, \"Go and see her just for a while, and then\ncome over at once into the garden; (for remember) she is your nephew's\nwife, (and you couldn't sit in there long).\"\n\nMrs. Yu forthwith invited mesdames Wang and Hsing, as well as her own\nmother, to adjourn to the other side, and they all in a body walked into\nthe garden of Concentrated Fragrance; while lady Feng and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc betook\nthemselves, in company with Chia Jung, over to this side.\n\nHaving entered the door, they with quiet step walked as far as the\nentrance of the inner chamber. Mrs. Ch'in, upon catching sight of them,\nwas bent upon getting up; but \"Be quick,\" remonstrated lady Feng, \"and\ngive up all idea of standing up; for take care your head will feel\ndizzy.\"\n\nLady Feng hastened to make a few hurried steps forward and to grasp Mrs.\nCh'in's hand in hers. \"My dear girl!\" she exclaimed; \"How is it that\nduring the few days I've not seen you, you have grown so thin?\"\n\nReadily she then took a seat on the rug, on which Mrs. Ch'in was seated,\nwhile Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, after inquiring too about her health, sat in the chair on\nthe opposite side.\n\n\"Bring the tea in at once,\" called out Chia Jung, \"for aunt and uncle\nSecundus have not had any tea in the drawing room.\"\n\nMrs. Ch'in took lady Feng's hand in her own and forced a smile. \"This is\nall due to my lack of good fortune; for in such a family as this, my\nfather and mother-in-law treat me just as if I were a daughter of their\nown flesh and blood! Besides, your nephew, (my husband,) may, it is\ntrue, my dear aunt, be young in years, but he is full of regard for me,\nas I have regard for him, and we have had so far no misunderstanding\nbetween us! In fact, among the senior generation, as well as that of the\nsame age as myself, in the whole clan, putting you aside, aunt, about\nwhom no mention need be made, there is not one who has not ever had\nanything but love for me, and not one who has not ever shown me anything\nbut kindness! But since I've fallen ill with this complaint, all my\nenergy has even every bit of it been taken out of me, so that I've been\nunable to show to my father and mother-in-law any mark of filial\nattention, yea so much as for one single day and to you, my dear aunt,\nwith all this affection of yours for me, I have every wish to be dutiful\nto the utmost degree, but, in my present state, I'm really not equal to\nit; my own idea is, that it isn't likely that I shall last through this\nyear.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc kept, while (she spoke,) his eyes fixed intently upon a picture\non the opposite side, representing some begonias drooping in the spring\ntime, and upon a pair of scrolls, with this inscription written by Ch'in\nTai-hs\u00c3\u00bc:\n\n  A gentle chill doth circumscribe the dreaming man because the spring\n      is cold!\n  The fragrant whiff which wafts itself into man's nose, is the perfume\n      of wine!\n\nAnd he could not help recalling to mind his experiences at the time when\nhe had fallen asleep in this apartment, and had, in his dream, visited\nthe confines of the Great Void. He was just plunged in a state of\nabstraction, when he heard Mrs. Ch'in give utterance to these\nsentiments, which pierced his heart as if they were ten thousand arrows,\n(with the result that) tears unwittingly trickled from his eyes.\n\nLady Feng perceiving him in tears felt it extremely painful within\nherself to bear the sight; but she was on pins and needles lest the\npatient should detect their frame of mind, and feel, instead (of\nbenefit), still more sore at heart, which would not, after all, be quite\nthe purpose of her visit; which was to afford her distraction and\nconsolation. \"Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc,\" she therefore exclaimed, \"you are like an old\nwoman! Ill, as she is, simply makes her speak in this wise, and how ever\ncould things come to such a pass! Besides, she is young in years, so\nthat after a short indisposition, her illness will get all right!\"\n\"Don't,\" she said as she turned towards Mrs. Ch'in, \"give way to silly\nthoughts and idle ideas! for by so doing won't you yourself be\naggravating your ailment?\"\n\n\"All that her sickness in fact needs,\" observed Chia Jung, \"is, that she\nshould be able to take something to eat, and then there will be nothing\nto fear.\"\n\n\"Brother Pao,\" urged lady Feng, \"your mother told you to go over, as\nsoon as you could, so that don't stay here, and go on in the way you're\ndoing, for you after all incite this lady also to feel uneasy at heart.\nBesides, your mother over there is solicitous on your account.\" \"You had\nbetter go ahead with your uncle Pao,\" she consequently continued,\naddressing herself to Chia Jung, \"while I sit here a little longer.\"\n\nWhen Chia Jung heard this remark, he promptly crossed over with Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\ninto the garden of Concentrated Fragrance, while lady Feng went on both\nto cheer her up for a time, and to impart to her, in an undertone, a\ngood deal of confidential advice.\n\nMrs. Yu had despatched servants, on two or three occasions, to hurry\nlady Feng, before she said to Mrs. Ch'in: \"Do all you can to take good\ncare of yourself, and I'll come and see you again. You're bound to get\nover this illness; and now, in fact, that you've come across that\nrenowned doctor, you have really nothing more to fear.\"\n\n\"He might,\" observed Mrs. Ch'in as she smiled, \"even be a supernatural\nbeing and succeed in healing my disease, but he won't be able to remedy\nmy destiny; for, my dear aunt, I feel sure that with this complaint of\nmine, I can do no more than drag on from day to day.\"\n\n\"If you encourage such ideas,\" remonstrated lady Feng, \"how can this\nillness ever get all right? What you absolutely need is to cast away all\nthese notions, and then you'll improve. I hear moreover that the doctor\nasserts that if no cure be effected, the fear is of a change for the\nworse in spring, and not till then. Did you and I moreover belong to a\nfamily that hadn't the means to afford any ginseng, it would be\ndifficult to say how we could manage to get it; but were your father and\nmother-in-law to hear that it's good for your recovery, why not to speak\nof two mace of ginseng a day, but even two catties will be also within\ntheir means! So mind you do take every care of your health! I'm now off\non my way into the garden.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, my dear aunt,\" added Mrs. Ch'in, \"that I can't go with you;\nbut when you have nothing to do, I entreat you do come over and see me!\nand you and I can sit and have a long chat.\"\n\nAfter lady Feng had heard these words, her eyes unwillingly got quite\nred again. \"When I'm at leisure I shall, of course,\" she rejoined, \"come\noften to see you;\" and forthwith leading off the matrons and married\nwomen, who had come over with her, as well as the women and matrons of\nthe Ning mansion, she passed through the inner part of the house, and\nentered, by a circuitous way, the side gate of the park, when she\nperceived: yellow flowers covering the ground; white willows flanking\nthe slopes; diminutive bridges spanning streams, resembling the Jo Yeh;\nzigzag pathways (looking as if) they led to the steps of Heaven; limpid\nsprings dripping from among the rocks; flowers hanging from hedges\nemitting their fragrance, as they were flapped by the winds; red leaves\non the tree tops swaying to and fro; groves picture-like, half stripped\nof foliage; the western breeze coming with sudden gusts, and the wail of\nthe oriole still audible; the warm sun shining with genial rays, and the\ncicada also adding its chirp: structures, visible to the gaze at a\ndistance in the South-east, soaring high on various sites and resting\nagainst the hills; three halls, visible near by on the North-west,\nstretching in one connected line, on the bank of the stream; strains of\nmusic filling the pavilion, imbued with an unwonted subtle charm; and\nmaidens in fine attire penetrating the groves, lending an additional\nspell to the scene.\n\nLady Feng, while engaged in contemplating the beauties of the spot,\nadvanced onwards step by step. She was plunged in a state of ecstasy,\nwhen suddenly, from the rear of the artificial rockery, egressed a\nperson, who approached her and facing her said, \"My respects to you,\nsister-in-law.\"\n\nLady Feng was so startled by this unexpected appearance that she drew\nback. \"Isn't this Mr. Jui?\" she ventured.\n\n\"What! sister-in-law,\" exclaimed Chia Jui, \"don't you recognise even\nme?\"\n\n\"It isn't that I didn't recognise you,\" explained lady Feng, \"but at the\nsudden sight of you, I couldn't conceive that it would possibly be you,\nsir, in this place!\"\n\n\"This was in fact bound to be,\" replied Chia Jui; \"for there's some\nsubtle sympathy between me and you, sister-in-law. Here I just\nstealthily leave the entertainment, in order to revel for a while in\nthis solitary place when, against every expectation, I come across you,\nsister-in-law; and isn't this a subtle sympathy?\"\n\nAs he spoke, he kept his gaze fixed on lady Feng, who being an\nintelligent person, could not but arrive, at the sight of his manner, at\nthe whole truth in her surmises. \"It isn't to be wondered at,\" she\nconsequently observed, as she smiled hypocritically, \"that your eldest\nbrother should make frequent allusion to your qualities! for after\nseeing you on this occasion, and hearing you utter these few remarks, I\nhave readily discovered what an intelligent and genial person you are! I\nam just now on my way to join the ladies on the other side, and have no\nleisure to converse with you; but wait until I've nothing to attend to,\nwhen we can meet again.\"\n\n\"I meant to have gone over to your place and paid my respects to you,\nsister-in-law,\" pleaded Chia Jui, \"but I was afraid lest a person of\ntender years like yourself mightn't lightly receive any visitors!\"\n\nLady Feng gave another sardonic smile. \"Relatives,\" she continued, \"of\none family, as we are, what need is there to say anything of tender\nyears?\"\n\nAfter Chia Jui had heard these words, he felt his heart swell within him\nwith such secret joy that he was urged to reflect: \"I have at length\nto-day, when least I expected it, obtained this remarkable encounter\nwith her!\"\n\nBut as the display of his passion became still more repulsive, lady Feng\nurged him to go. \"Be off at once,\" she remarked, \"and join the\nentertainment; for mind, if they find you out, they will mulct you in so\nmany glasses of wine!\"\n\nBy the time this suggestion had reached Chia Jui's ears, half of his\nbody had become stiff like a log of wood; and as he betook himself away,\nwith lothful step, he turned his head round to cast glances at her. Lady\nFeng purposely slackened her pace; and when she perceived that he had\ngone a certain distance, she gave way to reflection. \"This is indeed,\"\nshe thought, \"knowing a person, as far as face goes, and not as heart!\nCan there be another such a beast as he! If he really continues to\nbehave in this manner, I shall soon enough compass his death, with my\nown hands, and he'll then know what stuff I'm made of.\"\n\nLady Feng, at this juncture moved onward, and after turning round a\nchain of hillocks, she caught sight of two or three matrons coming along\nwith all speed. As soon as they espied lady Feng they put on a smile.\n\"Our mistress,\" they said, \"perceiving that your ladyship was not\nforthcoming, has been in a great state of anxiety, and bade your\nservants come again to request you to come over.\n\n\"Is your mistress,\" observed lady Feng, \"so like a quick-footed demon?\"\n\nWhile lady Feng advanced leisurely, she inquired, \"How many plays have\nbeen recited?\" to which question one of the matrons replied, \"They have\ngone through eight or nine.\" But while engaged in conversation, they had\nalready reached the back door of the Tower of Celestial Fragrance, where\nshe caught sight of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc playing with a company of waiting-maids and\npages. \"Brother Pao,\" lady Feng exclaimed, \"don't be up to too much\nmischief!\" \"The ladies are all sitting upstairs,\" interposed one of the\nmaids. \"Please, my lady, this is the way up.\"\n\nAt these words lady Feng slackened her pace, raised her dress, and\nwalked up the stairs, where Mrs. Yu was already at the top of the\nlanding waiting for her.\n\n\"You two,\" remarked Mrs. Yu, smiling, \"are so friendly, that having met\nyou couldn't possibly tear yourself away to come. You had better\nto-morrow move over there and take up your quarters with her and have\ndone; but sit down and let me, first of all, present you a glass of\nwine.\"\n\nLady Feng speedily drew near mesdames Hsing and Wang, and begged\npermission to take a seat; while Mrs. Yu brought the programme, and\npressed lady Feng to mark some plays.\n\n\"The senior ladies occupy the seats of honour,\" remonstrated lady Feng,\n\"and how can I presume to choose?\"\n\n\"We, and our relative by marriage, have selected several plays,\"\nexplained mesdames Hsing and Wang, \"and it's for you now to choose some\ngood ones for us to listen to.\"\n\nStanding up, lady Feng signified her obedience; and taking over the\nprogramme, and perusing it from top to bottom, she marked off one\nentitled, the \"Return of the Spirit,\" and another called \"Thrumming and\nSinging;\" after which she handed back the programme, observing, \"When\nthey have done with the 'Ennoblement of two Officers,' which they are\nsinging just at present, it will be time enough to sing these two.\"\n\n\"Of course it will,\" retorted madame Wang, \"but they should get it over\nas soon as they can, so as to allow your elder Brother and your\nSister-in-law to have rest; besides, their hearts are not at ease.\"\n\n\"You senior ladies don't come often,\" expostulated Mrs. Yu, \"and you and\nI will derive more enjoyment were we to stay a little longer; it's as\nyet early in the day!\"\n\nLady Feng stood up and looked downstairs. \"Where have all the gentlemen\ngone to?\" she inquired.\n\n\"The gentlemen have just gone over to the Pavilion of Plenteous\nEffulgence,\" replied a matron, who stood by; \"they have taken along with\nthem ten musicians and gone in there to drink their wine.\"\n\n\"It wasn't convenient for them,\" remarked lady Feng, \"to be over here;\nbut who knows what they have again gone to do behind our backs?\"\n\n\"Could every one,\" interposed Mrs. Yu, \"resemble you, a person of such\npropriety!\"\n\nWhile they indulged in chatting and laughing, the plays they had chosen\nwere all finished; whereupon the tables were cleared of the wines, and\nthe repast was served. The meal over, the whole company adjourned into\nthe garden, and came and sat in the drawing-room. After tea, they at\nlength gave orders to get ready the carriages, and they took their leave\nof Mrs. Yu's mother. Mrs. Yu, attended by all the secondary wives,\nservants, and married women, escorted them out, while Chia Chen, along\nwith the whole bevy of young men, stood by the vehicles, waiting in a\ngroup for their arrival.\n\nAfter saluting mesdames Hsing and Wang, \"Aunts,\" they said, \"you must\ncome over again to-morrow for a stroll.\"\n\n\"We must be excused,\" observed madame Wang, \"we've sat here the whole\nday to-day, and are, after all, feeling quite tired; besides, we shall\nneed to have some rest to-morrow.\"\n\nBoth of them thereupon got into their carriages and took their\ndeparture, while Chia Jui still kept a fixed gaze upon lady Feng; and it\nwas after Chia Chen had gone in that Li Kuei led round the horse, and\nthat Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc mounted and went off, following in the track of mesdames\nHsing and Wang.\n\nChia Chen and the whole number of brothers and nephews belonging to the\nfamily had, during this interval, partaken of their meal, and the whole\nparty at length broke up. But in like manner, all the inmates of the\nclan and the guests spent on the morrow another festive day, but we need\nnot advert to it with any minuteness.\n\nAfter this occasion, lady Feng came in person and paid frequent visits\nto Mrs. Ch'in; but as there were some days on which her ailment was\nconsiderably better, and others on which it was considerably worse, Chia\nChen, Mrs. Yu, and Chia Jung were in an awful state of anxiety.\n\nChia Jui, it must moreover be noticed, came over, on several instances,\non a visit to the Jung mansion; but it invariably happened that he found\nthat lady Feng had gone over to the Ning mansion.\n\nThis was just the thirtieth of the eleventh moon, the day on which the\nwinter solstice fell; and the few days preceding that season, dowager\nlady Chia, madame Wang and lady Feng did not let one day go by without\nsending some one to inquire about Mrs. Ch'in; and as the servants, on\ntheir return, repeatedly reported that, during the last few days,\nneither had her ailment aggravated, nor had it undergone any marked\nimprovement, madame Wang explained to dowager lady Chia, that as a\ncomplaint of this nature had reached this kind of season without getting\nany worse, there was some hope of recovery.\n\n\"Of course there is!\" observed the old lady; \"what a dear child she is!\nshould anything happen to her, won't it be enough to make people die\nfrom grief!\" and as she spake she felt for a time quite sore at heart.\n\"You and she,\" continuing, she said to lady Feng, \"have been friends for\never so long; to-morrow is the glorious first (and you can't go), but\nafter to-morrow you should pay her a visit and minutely scrutinise her\nappearance: and should you find her any better, come and tell me on your\nreturn! Whatever things that dear child has all along a fancy for, do\nsend her round a few even as often as you can by some one or other!\"\n\nLady Feng assented to each of her recommendations; and when the second\narrived, she came, after breakfast, to the Ning mansion to see how Mrs.\nCh'in was getting on; and though she found her none the worse, the flesh\nall over her face and person had however become emaciated and parched\nup. She readily sat with Mrs. Ch'in for a long while, and after they had\nchatted on one thing and another, she again reiterated the assurances\nthat this illness involved no danger, and distracted her for ever so\nlong.\n\n\"Whether I get well or not,\" observed Mrs. Ch'in, \"we'll know in spring;\nnow winter is just over, and I'm anyhow no worse, so that possibly I may\nget all right; and yet there's no saying; but, my dear sister-in-law, do\npress our old lady to compose her mind! yesterday, her ladyship sent me\nsome potato dumplings, with minced dates in them, and though I had two,\nthey seem after all to be very easily digested!\"\n\n\"I'll send you round some more to-morrow,\" lady Feng suggested; \"I'm now\ngoing to look up your mother-in-law, and will then hurry back to give my\nreport to our dowager lady.\"\n\n\"Please, sister-in-law,\" Mrs. Ch'in said, \"present my best respects to\nher venerable ladyship, as well as to madame Wang.\"\n\nLady Feng signified that she would comply with her wishes, and,\nforthwith leaving the apartment, she came over and sat in Mrs. Yu's\nsuite of rooms.\n\n\"How do you, who don't see our son's wife very often, happen to find\nher?\" inquired Mrs. Yu.\n\nLady Feng drooped her head for some time. \"There's no help,\" she\nventured, \"for this illness! but you should likewise make every\nsubsequent preparation, for it would also be well if you could scour it\naway.\"\n\n\"I've done so much as to secretly give orders,\" replied Mrs. Yu, \"to get\nthings ready; but for that thing (the coffin), there's no good timber to\nbe found, so that it will have to be looked after by and by.\"\n\nLady Feng swallowed hastily a cup of tea, and after a short chat, \"I\nmust be hurrying back,\" she remarked, \"to deliver my message to our\ndowager lady!\"\n\n\"You should,\" urged Mrs. Yu, \"be sparse in what you tell her lady ship\nso as not to frighten an old person like her!\"\n\n\"I know well enough what to say,\" replied lady Feng.\n\nWithout any further delay, lady Feng then sped back. On her arrival at\nhome she looked up the old lady. \"Brother Jung's wife,\" she explained,\n\"presents her compliments, and pays obeisance to your venerable\nladyship; she says that she's much better, and entreats you, her worthy\nsenior, to set your mind at ease! That as soon as she's a little better\nshe will come and prostrate herself before your ladyship.\"\n\n\"How do you find her?\" inquired dowager lady Chia.\n\n\"For the present there's nothing to fear,\" continued lady Feng; \"for her\nmien is still good.\"\n\nAfter the old lady had heard these words, she was plunged for a long\nwhile in deep reflection; and as she turned towards lady Feng, \"Go and\ndivest yourself of your toilette,\" she said, \"and have some rest.\"\n\nLady Feng in consequence signified her obedience, and walked away,\nreturning home after paying madame Wang a visit. P'ing Erh helped lady\nFeng to put on the house costume, which she had warmed by the fire, and\nlady Feng eventually took a seat and asked \"whether there was anything\ndoing at home?\"\n\nP'ing Erh then brought the tea, and after going over to hand the cup:\n\"There's nothing doing,\" she replied; \"as regards the interest on the\nthree hundred taels, Wang Erh's wife has brought it in, and I've put it\naway. Besides this, Mr. Jui sent round to inquire if your ladyship was\nat home or not, as he meant to come and pay his respects and to have a\nchat.\"\n\n\"Heng!\" exclaimed lady Feng at these words. \"Why should this beast\ncompass his own death? we'll see when he comes what is to be done.\"\n\n\"Why is this Mr. Jui so bent upon coming?' P'ing Erh having inquired,\nlady Feng readily gave her an account of how she had met him in the\ncourse of the ninth moon in the Ning mansion, and of what had been said\nby him.\n\n\"What a mangy frog to be bent upon eating the flesh of a heavenly\ngoose!\" ejaculated P'ing Erh. \"A stupid and disorderly fellow with no\nconception of relationship, to harbour such a thought! but we'll make\nhim find an unnatural death!\"\n\n\"Wait till he comes,\" added lady Feng, \"when I feel certain I shall find\nsome way.\"\n\nWhat happened, however, when Chia Jui came has not, as yet, been\nascertained, but listen, reader, to the explanation given in the next\nchapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n  Wang Hsi-feng maliciously lays a trap for Chia Jui, under pretence\n      that his affection is reciprocated.\n  Chia T'ien-hsiang gazes at the face of the mirror of Voluptuousness.\n\n\nLady Feng, it must be noticed in continuation of our narrative, was just\nengaged in talking with P'ing Erh, when they heard some one announce\nthat Mr. Jui had come. Lady Feng gave orders that he should be invited\nto step in, and Chia Jui perceiving that he had been asked to walk in\nwas at heart elated at the prospect of seeing her.\n\nWith a face beaming with smiles, Lady Feng inquired again and again how\nhe was; and, with simulated tenderness she further pressed him to take a\nseat and urged him to have a cup of tea.\n\nChia Jui noticed how still more voluptuous lady Feng looked in her\npresent costume, and, as his eyes burnt with love, \"How is it,\" he\ninquired, \"that my elder brother Secundus is not yet back?\"\n\n\"What the reason is I cannot tell,\" lady Feng said by way of reply.\n\n\"May it not be,\" Chia Jui smilingly insinuated, \"that some fair damsel\nhas got hold of him on the way, and that he cannot brook to tear himself\nfrom her to come home?\"\n\n\"That makes it plain that there are those among men who fall in love\nwith any girl they cast their eyes on,\" hinted lady Feng.\n\n\"Your remarks are, sister-in-law, incorrect, for I'm none of this kind!\"\nChia Jui explained smirkingly.\n\n\"How many like you can there be!\" rejoined lady Feng with a sarcastic\nsmile; \"in ten, not one even could be picked out!\"\n\nWhen Chia Jui heard these words, he felt in such high glee that he\nrubbed his ears and smoothed his cheeks. \"My sister-in-law,\" he\ncontinued, \"you must of course be extremely lonely day after day.\"\n\n\"Indeed I am,\" observed lady Feng, \"and I only wish some one would come\nand have a chat with me to break my dull monotony.\"\n\n\"I daily have ample leisure,\" Chia Jui ventured with a simper, \"and\nwouldn't it be well if I came every day to dispel your dulness,\nsister-in-law?\"\n\n\"You are simply fooling me,\" exclaimed lady Feng laughing. \"It isn't\nlikely you would wish to come over here to me?\"\n\n\"If in your presence, sister-in-law, I utter a single word of falsehood,\nmay the thunder from heaven blast me!\" protested Chia Jui. \"It's only\nbecause I had all along heard people say that you were a dreadful\nperson, and that you cannot condone even the slightest shortcoming\ncommitted in your presence, that I was induced to keep back by fear; but\nafter seeing you, on this occasion, so chatty, so full of fun and most\nconsiderate to others, how can I not come? were it to be the cause of my\ndeath, I would be even willing to come!\"\n\n\"You're really a clever person,\" lady Feng observed sarcastically. \"And\noh so much superior to both Chia Jung and his brother! Handsome as their\npresence was to look at, I imagined their minds to be full of\nintelligence, but who would have thought that they would, after all, be\na couple of stupid worms, without the least notion of human affection!\"\n\nThe words which Chia Jui heard, fell in so much the more with his own\nsentiments, that he could not restrain himself from again pressing\nforward nearer to her; and as with eyes strained to give intentness to\nhis view, he gazed at lady Feng's purse: \"What rings have you got on?\"\nhe went on to ask.\n\n\"You should be a little more deferential,\" remonstrated lady Feng in a\nlow tone of voice, \"so as not to let the waiting-maids detect us.\"\n\nChia Jui withdrew backward with as much alacrity as if he had received\nan Imperial decree or a mandate from Buddha.\n\n\"You ought to be going!\" lady Feng suggested, as she gave him a smile.\n\n\"Do let me stay a while longer,\" entreated Chia Jui, \"you are indeed\nruthless, my sister-in-law.\"\n\nBut with gentle voice did lady Feng again expostulate. \"In broad\ndaylight,\" she said, \"with people coming and going, it is not really\nconvenient that you should abide in here; so you had better go, and when\nit's dark and the watch is set, you can come over, and quietly wait for\nme in the corridor on the Eastern side!\"\n\nAt these words, Chia Jui felt as if he had received some jewel or\nprecious thing. \"Don't make fun of me!\" he remarked with vehemence. \"The\nonly thing is that crowds of people are ever passing from there, and how\nwill it be possible for me to evade detection?\"\n\n\"Set your mind at ease!\" lady Feng advised; \"I shall dismiss on leave\nall the youths on duty at night; and when the doors, on both sides, are\nclosed, there will be no one else to come in!\"\n\nChia Jui was delighted beyond measure by the assurance, and with\nimpetuous haste, he took his leave and went off; convinced at heart of\nthe gratification of his wishes. He continued, up to the time of dusk, a\nprey to keen expectation; and, when indeed darkness fell, he felt his\nway into the Jung mansion, availing himself of the moment, when the\ndoors were being closed, to slip into the corridor, where everything was\nactually pitch dark, and not a soul to be seen going backwards or\nforwards.\n\nThe door leading over to dowager lady Chia's apartments had already been\nput under key, and there was but one gate, the one on the East, which\nhad not as yet been locked. Chia Jui lent his ear, and listened for ever\nso long, but he saw no one appear. Suddenly, however, was heard a sound\nlike \"lo teng,\" and the east gate was also bolted; but though Chia Jui\nwas in a great state of impatience, he none the less did not venture to\nutter a sound. All that necessity compelled him to do was to issue, with\nquiet steps, from his corner, and to try the gates by pushing; but they\nwere closed as firmly as if they had been made fast with iron bolts; and\nmuch though he may, at this juncture, have wished to find his way out,\nescape was, in fact, out of the question; on the south and north was one\ncontinuous dead wall, which, even had he wished to scale, there was\nnothing which he could clutch and pull himself up by.\n\nThis room, besides, was one the interior (of which was exposed) to the\nwind, which entered through (the fissure) of the door; and was perfectly\nempty and bare; and the weather being, at this time, that of December,\nand the night too very long, the northerly wind, with its biting gusts,\nwas sufficient to penetrate the flesh and to cleave the bones, so that\nthe whole night long he had a narrow escape from being frozen to death;\nand he was yearning, with intolerable anxiety for the break of day, when\nhe espied an old matron go first and open the door on the East side, and\nthen come in and knock at the western gate.\n\nChia Jui seeing that she had turned her face away, bolted out, like a\nstreak of smoke, as he hugged his shoulders with his hands (from intense\ncold.) As luck would have it, the hour was as yet early, so that the\ninmates of the house had not all got out of bed; and making his escape\nfrom the postern door, he straightaway betook himself home, running back\nthe whole way.\n\nChia Jui's parents had, it must be explained, departed life at an early\nperiod, and he had no one else, besides his grandfather Tai-ju, to take\ncharge of his support and education. This Tai-ju had, all along,\nexercised a very strict control, and would not allow Chia Jui to even\nmake one step too many, in the apprehension that he might gad about out\nof doors drinking and gambling, to the neglect of his studies.\n\nSeeing, on this unexpected occasion, that he had not come home the whole\nnight, he simply felt positive, in his own mind, that he was certain to\nhave run about, if not drinking, at least gambling, and dissipating in\nhouses of the demi-monde up to the small hours; but he never even gave\nso much as a thought to the possibility of a public scandal, as that in\nwhich he was involved. The consequence was that during the whole length\nof the night he boiled with wrath.\n\nChia Jui himself, on the other hand, was (in such a state of\ntrepidation) that he could wipe the perspiration (off his face) by\nhandfuls; and he felt constrained on his return home, to have recourse\nto deceitful excuses, simply explaining that he had been at his eldest\nmaternal uncle's house, and that when it got dark, they kept him to\nspend the night there.\n\n\"Hitherto,\" remonstrated Tai-ju, \"when about to go out of doors, you\nnever ventured to go, on your own hook, without first telling me about\nit, and how is it that yesterday you surreptitiously left the house? for\nthis offence alone you deserve a beating, and how much more for the lie\nimposed upon me.\"\n\nInto such a violent fit of anger did he consequently fly that laying\nhands on him, he pulled him over and administered to him thirty or forty\nblows with a cane. Nor would he allow him to have anything to eat, but\nbade him remain on his knees in the court conning essays; impressing on\nhis mind that he would not let him off, before he had made up for the\nlast ten days' lessons.\n\nChia Jui had in the first instance, frozen the whole night, and, in the\nnext place, came in for a flogging. With a stomach, besides, gnawed by\nthe pangs of hunger, he had to kneel in a place exposed to drafts\nreading the while literary compositions, so that the hardships he had to\nendure were of manifold kinds.\n\nChia Jui's infamous intentions had at this junction undergone no change;\nbut far from his thoughts being even then any idea that lady Feng was\nhumbugging him, he seized, after the lapse of a couple of days, the\nfirst leisure moments to come again in search of that lady.\n\nLady Feng pretended to bear him a grudge for his breach of faith, and\nChia Jui was so distressed that he tried by vows and oaths (to establish\nhis innocence.) Lady Feng perceiving that he had, of his own accord,\nfallen into the meshes of the net laid for him, could not but devise\nanother plot to give him a lesson and make him know what was right and\nmend his ways.\n\nWith this purpose, she gave him another assignation. \"Don't go over\nthere,\" she said, \"to-night, but wait for me in the empty rooms giving\non to a small passage at the back of these apartments of mine. But\nwhatever you do, mind don't be reckless.\"\n\n\"Are you in real earnest?\" Chia Jui inquired.\n\n\"Why, who wants to play with you?\" replied lady Feng; \"if you don't\nbelieve what I say, well then don't come!\"\n\n\"I'll come, I'll come, yea I'll come, were I even to die!\" protested\nChia Jui.\n\n\"You should first at this very moment get away!\" lady Feng having\nsuggested, Chia Jui, who felt sanguine that when evening came, success\nwould for a certainty crown his visit, took at once his departure in\nanticipation (of his pleasure.)\n\nDuring this interval lady Feng hastily set to work to dispose of her\nresources, and to add to her stratagems, and she laid a trap for her\nvictim; while Chia Jui, on the other hand, was until the shades of\ndarkness fell, a prey to incessant expectation.\n\nAs luck would have it a relative of his happened to likewise come on\nthat very night to their house and to only leave after he had dinner\nwith them, and at an hour of the day when the lamps had already been\nlit; but he had still to wait until his grandfather had retired to rest\nbefore he could, at length with precipitate step, betake himself into\nthe Jung mansion.\n\nStraightway he came into the rooms in the narrow passage, and waited\nwith as much trepidation as if he had been an ant in a hot pan. He\nhowever waited and waited, but he saw no one arrive; he listened but not\neven the sound of a voice reached his ear. His heart was full of intense\nfear, and he could not restrain giving way to surmises and suspicion.\n\"May it not be,\" he thought, \"that she is not coming again; and that I\nmay have once more to freeze for another whole night?\"\n\nWhile indulging in these erratic reflections, he discerned some one\ncoming, looking like a black apparition, who Chia Jui readily concluded,\nin his mind, must be lady Feng; so that, unmindful of distinguishing\nblack from white, he as soon as that person arrived in front of him,\nspeedily clasped her in his embrace, like a ravenous tiger pouncing upon\nits prey, or a cat clawing a rat, and cried: \"My darling sister, you\nhave made me wait till I'm ready to die.\"\n\nAs he uttered these words, he dragged the comer, in his arms, on to the\ncouch in the room; and while indulging in kisses and protestations of\nwarm love, he began to cry out at random epithets of endearment.\n\nNot a sound, however, came from the lips of the other person; and Chia\nJui had in the fulness of his passion, exceeded the bounds of timid love\nand was in the act of becoming still more affectionate in his\nprotestations, when a sudden flash of a light struck his eye, by the\nrays of which he espied Chia Se with a candle in hand, casting the light\nround the place, \"Who's in this room?\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Uncle Jui,\" he heard some one on the couch explain, laughing, \"was\ntrying to take liberties with me!\"\n\nChia Jui at one glance became aware that it was no other than Chia Jung;\nand a sense of shame at once so overpowered him that he could find\nnowhere to hide himself; nor did he know how best to extricate himself\nfrom the dilemma. Turning himself round, he made an attempt to make good\nhis escape, when Chia Se with one grip clutched him in his hold.\n\n\"Don't run away,\" he said; \"sister-in-law Lien has already reported your\nconduct to madame Wang; and explained that you had tried to make her\ncarry on an improper flirtation with you; that she had temporised by\nhaving recourse to a scheme to escape your importunities, and that she\nhad imposed upon you in such a way as to make you wait for her in this\nplace. Our lady was so terribly incensed, that she well-nigh succumbed;\nand hence it is that she bade me come and catch you! Be quick now and\nfollow me, and let us go and see her.\"\n\nAfter Chia Jui had heard these words, his very soul could not be\ncontained within his body.\n\n\"My dear nephew,\" he entreated, \"do tell her that it wasn't I; and I'll\nshow you my gratitude to-morrow in a substantial manner.\"\n\n\"Letting you off,\" rejoined Chia Se, \"is no difficult thing; but how\nmuch, I wonder, are you likely to give? Besides, what you now utter with\nyour lips, there will be no proof to establish; so you had better write\na promissory note.\"\n\n\"How could I put what happened in black and white on paper?\" observed\nChia Jui.\n\n\"There's no difficulty about that either!\" replied Chia Se; \"just write\nan account of a debt due, for losses in gambling, to some one outside;\nfor payment of which you had to raise funds, by a loan of a stated\nnumber of taels, from the head of the house; and that will be all that\nis required.\"\n\n\"This is, in fact, easy enough!\" Chia Jui having added by way of answer;\nChia Se turned round and left the room; and returning with paper and\npencils, which had been got ready beforehand for the purpose, he bade\nChia Jui write. The two of them (Chia Jung and Chia Se) tried, the one\nto do a good turn, and the other to be perverse in his insistence; but\n(Chia Jui) put down no more than fifty taels, and appended his\nsignature.\n\nChia Se pocketed the note, and endeavoured subsequently to induce Chia\nJung to come away; but Chia Jung was, at the outset, obdurate and\nunwilling to give in, and kept on repeating; \"To-morrow, I'll tell the\nmembers of our clan to look into your nice conduct!\"\n\nThese words plunged Chia Jui in such a state of dismay, that he even\nwent so far as to knock his head on the ground; but, as Chia Se was\ntrying to get unfair advantage of him though he had at first done him a\ngood turn, he had to write another promissory note for fifty taels,\nbefore the matter was dropped.\n\nTaking up again the thread of the conversation, Chia Se remarked, \"Now\nwhen I let you go, I'm quite ready to bear the blame! But the gate at\nour old lady's over there is already bolted, and Mr. Chia Cheng is just\nnow engaged in the Hall, looking at the things which have arrived from\nNanking, so that it would certainly be difficult for you to pass through\nthat way. The only safe course at present is by the back gate; but if\nyou do go by there, and perchance meet any one, even I will be in for a\nmess; so you might as well wait until I go first and have a peep, when\nI'll come and fetch you! You couldn't anyhow conceal yourself in this\nroom; for in a short time they'll be coming to stow the things away, and\nyou had better let me find a safe place for you.\"\n\nThese words ended, he took hold of Chia Jui, and, extinguishing again\nthe lantern, he brought him out into the court, feeling his way up to\nthe bottom of the steps of the large terrace. \"It's safe enough in this\nnest,\" he observed, \"but just squat down quietly and don't utter a\nsound; wait until I come back before you venture out.\"\n\nHaving concluded this remark, the two of them (Chia Se and Chia Jung)\nwalked away; while Chia Jui was, all this time, out of his senses, and\nfelt constrained to remain squatting at the bottom of the terrace\nstairs. He was about to consider what course was open for him to adopt,\nwhen he heard a noise just over his head; and, with a splash, the\ncontents of a bucket, consisting entirely of filthy water, was emptied\nstraight down over him from above, drenching, as luck would have it, his\nwhole person and head.\n\nChia Jui could not suppress an exclamation. \"Ai ya!\" he cried, but he\nhastily stopped his mouth with his hands, and did not venture to give\nvent to another sound. His whole head and face were a mass of filth, and\nhis body felt icy cold. But as he shivered and shook, he espied Chia Se\ncome running. \"Get off,\" he shouted, \"with all speed! off with you at\nonce!\"\n\nAs soon as Chia Jui returned to life again, he bolted with hasty\nstrides, out of the back gate, and ran the whole way home. The night had\nalready reached the third watch, so that he had to knock at the door for\nit to be opened.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" inquired the servants, when they saw him in this\nsorry plight; (an inquiry) which placed him in the necessity of making\nsome false excuse. \"The night was dark,\" he explained, \"and my foot\nslipped and I fell into a gutter.\"\n\nSaying this, he betook himself speedily to his own apartment; and it was\nonly after he had changed his clothes and performed his ablutions, that\nhe began to realise that lady Feng had made a fool of him. He\nconsequently gave way to a fit of wrath; but upon recalling to mind the\ncharms of lady Feng's face, he felt again extremely aggrieved that he\ncould not there and then clasp her in his embrace, and as he indulged in\nthese wild thoughts and fanciful ideas, he could not the whole night\nlong close his eyes.\n\nFrom this time forward his mind was, it is true, still with lady Feng,\nbut he did not have the courage to put his foot into the Jung mansion;\nand with Chia Jung and Chia Se both coming time and again to dun him for\nthe money, he was likewise full of fears lest his grandfather should\ncome to know everything.\n\nHis passion for lady Feng was, in fact, already a burden hard to bear,\nand when, moreover, the troubles of debts were superadded to his tasks,\nwhich were also during the whole day arduous, he, a young man of about\ntwenty, as yet unmarried, and a prey to constant cravings for lady Feng,\nwhich were difficult to gratify, could not avoid giving way, to a great\nextent, to such evil habits as exhausted his energies. His lot had, what\nis more, been on two occasions to be frozen, angered and to endure much\nhardship, so that with the attacks received time and again from all\nsides, he unconsciously soon contracted an organic disease. In his heart\ninflammation set in; his mouth lost the sense of taste; his feet got as\nsoft as cotton from weakness; his eyes stung, as if there were vinegar\nin them. At night, he burnt with fever. During the day, he was\nrepeatedly under the effects of lassitude. Perspiration was profuse,\nwhile with his expectorations of phlegm, he brought up blood. The whole\nnumber of these several ailments came upon him, before the expiry of a\nyear, (with the result that) in course of time, he had not the strength\nto bear himself up. Of a sudden, he would fall down, and with his eyes,\nalbeit closed, his spirit would be still plunged in confused dreams,\nwhile his mouth would be full of nonsense and he would be subject to\nstrange starts.\n\nEvery kind of doctor was asked to come in, and every treatment had\nrecourse to; and, though of such medicines as cinnamon, aconitum seeds,\nturtle shell, ophiopogon, Y\u00c3\u00bc-ch\u00c3\u00bc herb, and the like, he took several\ntens of catties, he nevertheless experienced no change for the better;\nso that by the time the twelfth moon drew once again to an end, and\nspring returned, this illness had become still more serious.\n\nTai-ju was very much concerned, and invited doctors from all parts to\nattend to him, but none of them could do him any good. And as later on,\nhe had to take nothing else but decoctions of pure ginseng, Tai-ju could\nnot of course afford it. Having no other help but to come over to the\nJung mansion, and make requisition for some, Madame Wang asked lady Feng\nto weigh two taels of it and give it to him. \"The other day,\" rejoined\nlady Feng, \"not long ago, when we concocted some medicine for our\ndowager lady, you told us, madame, to keep the pieces that were whole,\nto present to the spouse of General Yang to make physic with, and as it\nhappens it was only yesterday that I sent some one round with them.\"\n\n\"If there's none over here in our place,\" suggested madame Wang, \"just\nsend a servant to your mother-in-law's, on the other side, to inquire\nwhether they have any. Or it may possibly be that your elder\nbrother-in-law Chen, over there, might have a little. If so, put all you\nget together, and give it to them; and when he shall have taken it, and\ngot well and you shall have saved the life of a human being, it will\nreally be to the benefit of you all.\"\n\nLady Feng acquiesced; but without directing a single person to institute\nany search, she simply took some refuse twigs, and making up a few mace,\nshe despatched them with the meagre message that they had been sent by\nmadame Wang, and that there was, in fact, no more; subsequently\nreporting to madame Wang that she had asked for and obtained all there\nwas and that she had collected as much as two taels, and forwarded it to\nthem.\n\nChia Jui was, meanwhile, very anxious to recover his health, so that\nthere was no medicine that he would not take, but the outlay of money\nwas of no avail, for he derived no benefit.\n\nOn a certain day and at an unexpected moment, a lame Taoist priest came\nto beg for alms, and he averred that he had the special gift of healing\ndiseases arising from grievances received, and as Chia Jui happened,\nfrom inside, to hear what he said, he forthwith shouted out: \"Go at\nonce, and bid that divine come in and save my life!\" while he\nreverentially knocked his head on the pillow.\n\nThe whole bevy of servants felt constrained to usher the Taoist in; and\nChia Jui, taking hold of him with a dash, \"My Buddha!\" he repeatedly\ncried out, \"save my life!\"\n\nThe Taoist heaved a sigh. \"This ailment of yours,\" he remarked, \"is not\none that could be healed with any medicine; I have a precious thing here\nwhich I'll give you, and if you gaze at it every day, your life can be\nsaved!\"\n\nWhen he had done talking, he produced from his pouch a looking-glass\nwhich could reflect a person's face on the front and back as well. On\nthe upper part of the back were engraved the four characters: \"Precious\nMirror of Voluptuousness.\" Handing it over to Chia Jui: \"This object,\"\nhe proceeded, \"emanates from the primordial confines of the Great Void\nand has been wrought by the Monitory Dream Fairy in the Palace of\nUnreality and Spirituality, with the sole intent of healing the\nillnesses which originate from evil thoughts and improper designs.\nPossessing, as it does, the virtue of relieving mankind and preserving\nlife, I have consequently brought it along with me into the world, but I\nonly give it to those intelligent pre\u00c3\u00abminent and refined princely men to\nset their eyes on. On no account must you look at the front side; and\nyou should only gaze at the back of it; this is urgent, this is\nexpedient! After three days, I shall come and fetch it away; by which\ntime, I'm sure, it will have made him all right.\"\n\nThese words finished, he walked away with leisurely step, and though all\ntried to detain him, they could not succeed.\n\nChia Jui received the mirror. \"This Taoist,\" he thought, \"would seem to\nspeak sensibly, and why should I not look at it and try its effect?\" At\nthe conclusion of these thoughts, he took up the Mirror of\nVoluptuousness, and cast his eyes on the obverse side; but upon\nperceiving nought else than a skeleton standing in it, Chia Jui\nsustained such a fright that he lost no time in covering it with his\nhands and in abusing the Taoist. \"You good-for-nothing!\" he exclaimed,\n\"why should you frighten me so? but I'll go further and look at the\nfront and see what it's like.\"\n\nWhile he reflected in this manner, he readily looked into the face of\nthe mirror, wherein he caught sight of lady Feng standing, nodding her\nhead and beckoning to him. With one gush of joy, Chia Jui felt himself,\nin a vague and mysterious manner, transported into the mirror, where he\nheld an affectionate t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate with lady Feng. Lady Feng escorted him\nout again. On his return to bed, he gave vent to an exclamation of \"Ai\nyah!\" and opening his eyes, he turned the glass over once more; but\nstill, as hitherto, stood the skeleton in the back part.\n\nChia Jui had, it is true, experienced all the pleasant sensations of a\nt\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate, but his heart nevertheless did not feel gratified; so that\nhe again turned the front round, and gazed at lady Feng, as she still\nwaved her hand and beckoned to him to go. Once more entering the mirror,\nhe went on in the same way for three or four times, until this occasion,\nwhen just as he was about to issue from the mirror, he espied two\npersons come up to him, who made him fast with chains round the neck,\nand hauled him away. Chia Jui shouted. \"Let me take the mirror and I'll\ncome along.\" But only this remark could he utter, for it was forthwith\nbeyond his power to say one word more. The servants, who stood by in\nattendance, saw him at first still holding the glass in his hand and\nlooking in, and then, when it fell from his grasp, open his eyes again\nto pick it up, but when at length the mirror dropped, and he at once\nceased to move, they in a body came forward to ascertain what had\nhappened to him. He had already breathed his last. The lower part of his\nbody was icy-cold; his clothes moist from profuse perspiration. With all\npromptitude they changed him there and then, and carried him to another\nbed.\n\nTai-ju and his wife wept bitterly for him, to the utter disregard of\ntheir own lives, while in violent terms they abused the Taoist priest.\n\"What kind of magical mirror is it?\" they asked. \"If we don't destroy\nthis glass, it will do harm to not a few men in the world!\"\n\nHaving forthwith given directions to bring fire and burn it, a voice was\nheard in the air to say, \"Who told you to look into the face of it? You\nyourselves have mistaken what is false for what is true, and why burn\nthis glass of mine?\"\n\nSuddenly the mirror was seen to fly away into the air; and when Tai-ju\nwent out of doors to see, he found no one else than the limping Taoist,\nshouting, \"Who is he who wishes to destroy the Mirror of\nVoluptuousness?\" While uttering these words, he snatched the glass, and,\nas all eyes were fixed upon him, he moved away lissomely, as if swayed\nby the wind.\n\nTai-ju at once made preparations for the funeral and went everywhere to\ngive notice that on the third day the obsequies would commence, that on\nthe seventh the procession would start to escort the coffin to the Iron\nFence Temple, and that on the subsequent day, it would be taken to his\noriginal home.\n\nNot much time elapsed before all the members of the Chia family came, in\na body, to express their condolences. Chia She, of the Jung Mansion,\npresented twenty taels, and Chia Cheng also gave twenty taels. Of the\nNing Mansion, Chia Chen likewise contributed twenty taels. The remainder\nof the members of the clan, of whom some were poor and some rich, and\nnot equally well off, gave either one or two taels, or three or four,\nsome more, some less. Among strangers, there were also contributions,\nrespectively presented by the families of his fellow-scholars,\namounting, likewise, collectively to twenty or thirty taels.\n\nThe private means of Tai-ju were, it is true, precarious, but with the\nmonetary assistance he obtained, he anyhow performed the funeral rites\nwith all splendour and \u00c3\u00a9clat.\n\nBut who would have thought it, at the close of winter of this year, Lin\nJu-hai contracted a serious illness, and forwarded a letter, by some\none, with the express purpose of fetching Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc back. These\ntidings, when they reached dowager lady Chia, naturally added to the\ngrief and distress (she already suffered), but she felt compelled to\nmake speedy preparations for Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc's departure. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc too was\nintensely cut up, but he had no alternative but to defer to the\naffection of father and daughter; nor could he very well place any\nhindrance in the way.\n\nOld lady Chia, in due course, made up her mind that she would like Chia\nLien to accompany her, and she also asked him to bring her back again\nalong with him. But no minute particulars need be given of the manifold\nlocal presents and of the preparations, which were, of course,\neverything that could be wished for in excellence and perfectness.\nForthwith the day for starting was selected, and Chia Lien, along with\nLin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, said good-bye to all the members of the family, and,\nfollowed by their attendants, they went on board their boats, and set\nout on their journey for Yang Chou.\n\nBut, Reader, should you have any wish to know fuller details, listen to\nthe account given in the subsequent Chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n  Ch'in K'o-ch'ing dies, and Chia Jung is invested with the rank of\n      military officer to the Imperial Body-guard.\n  Wang Hsi-feng lends her help in the management of the Jung Kuo\n      Mansion.\n\n\nLady Feng, it must be added, in prosecuting our narrative, was ever\nsince Chia Lien's departure to accompany Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc to Yang Chou, really\nvery dejected at heart; and every day, when evening came, she would,\nafter simply indulging in a chat and a laugh with P'ing Erh, turn in, in\na heedless frame of mind, for the night.\n\nIn the course of the night of this day, she had been sitting with P'ing\nErh by lamp-light clasping the hand-stove; and weary of doing her work\nof embroidery, she had at an early hour, given orders to warm the\nembroidered quilt, and both had gone to bed; and as she was bending her\nfingers, counting the progress of the journey, and when they should be\narriving, unexpectedly, the third watch struck.\n\nP'ing Erh had already fallen fast asleep; and lady Feng was feeling at\nlength her sleepy eyes slightly dose, when she faintly discerned Mrs.\nCh'in walk in from outside.\n\n\"My dear sister-in-law,\" she said as she smiled, \"sleep in peace; I'm on\nmy way back to-day, and won't even you accompany me just one stage? But\nas you and I have been great friends all along, I cannot part from you,\nsister-in-law, and have therefore come to take my leave of you. There\nis, besides, a wish of mine, which isn't yet accomplished; and if I\ndon't impart it to you, it isn't likely that telling any one else will\nbe of any use.\"\n\nLady Feng could not make out the sense of the words she heard. \"What\nwish is it you have?\" she inquired, \"do tell me, and it will be safe\nenough with me.\"\n\n\"You are, my dear sister-in-law, a heroine among women,\" observed Mrs.\nCh'in, \"so much so that those famous men, with sashes and official hats,\ncannot excel you; how is it that you're not aware of even a couple of\nlines of common adages, of that trite saying, 'when the moon is full, it\nbegins to wane; when the waters are high, they must overflow?' and of\nthat other which says that 'if you ascend high, heavy must be your\nfall.' Our family has now enjoyed splendour and prosperity for already\nwell-nigh a century, but a day comes when at the height of good fortune,\ncalamity arises; and if the proverb that 'when the tree falls, the\nmonkeys scatter,' be fulfilled, will not futile have been the reputation\nof culture and old standing of a whole generation?\"\n\nLady Feng at these words felt her heart heavy, and overpowered by\nintense awe and veneration.\n\n\"The fears you express are well founded,\" she urgently remarked, \"but\nwhat plan is there adequate to preserve it from future injury?\"\n\n\"My dear sister-in-law,\" rejoined Mrs. Ch'in with a sardonic smile,\n\"you're very simple indeed! When woe has reached its climax, weal\nsupervenes. Prosperity and adversity, from days of yore up to the\npresent time, now pass away, and now again revive, and how can\n(prosperity) be perpetuated by any human exertion? But if now, we could\nin the time of good fortune, make provision against any worldly\nconcerns, which might arise at any season of future adversity, we might\nin fact prolong and preserve it. Everything, for instance, is at present\nwell-regulated; but there are two matters which are not on a sure\nfooting, and if such and such suitable action could be adopted with\nregard to these concerns, it will, in subsequent days, be found easy to\nperpetuate the family welfare in its entity.\"\n\n\"What matters are these?\" inquired lady Feng.\n\n\"Though at the graves of our ancestors,\" explained Mrs. Ch'in,\n\"sacrifices and oblations be offered at the four seasons, there's\nnevertheless no fixed source of income. In the second place, the family\nschool is, it is true, in existence; but it has no definite\ngrants-in-aid. According to my views, now that the times are prosperous,\nthere's, as a matter of course, no lack of offerings and contributions;\nbut by and bye, when reverses set in, whence will these two outlays be\nmet from? Would it not be as well, and my ideas are positive on this\nscore, to avail ourselves of the present time, when riches and honours\nstill reign, to establish in the immediate vicinity of our ancestral\ntombs, a large number of farms, cottages, and estates, in order to\nenable the expenditure for offerings and grants to entirely emanate from\nthis source? And if the household school were also established on this\nprinciple, the old and young in the whole clan can, after they have, by\ncommon consent, determined upon rules, exercise in days to come control,\nin the order of the branches, over the affairs connected with the landed\nproperty, revenue, ancestral worship and school maintenance for the year\n(of their respective term.) Under this rotatory system, there will\nlikewise be no animosities; neither will there be any mortgages, or\nsales, or any of these numerous malpractices; and should any one happen\nto incur blame, his personal effects can be confiscated by Government.\nBut the properties, from which will be derived the funds for ancestral\nworship, even the officials should not be able to appropriate, so that\nwhen reverses do supervene, the sons and grandsons of the family may be\nable to return to their homes, and prosecute their studies, or go in for\nfarming. Thus, while they will have something to fall back upon, the\nancestral worship will, in like manner, be continued in perpetuity. But,\nif the present affluence and splendour be looked upon as bound to go on\nwithout intermission, and with no thought for the day to come, no\nenduring plan be after all devised, presently, in a little while, there\nwill, once again, transpire a felicitous occurrence of exceptional kind,\nwhich, in point of fact, will resemble the splendour of oil scorched on\na violent fire, or fresh flowers decorated with brocades. You should\nbear in mind that it will also be nothing more real than a transient\npageant, nothing but a short-lived pleasure! Whatever you do, don't\nforget the proverb, that 'there's no banquet, however sumptuous, from\nwhich the guests do not disperse;' and unless you do, at an early date,\ntake precautions against later evils, regret will, I apprehend, be of no\navail.\"\n\n\"What felicitous occurrence will take place?\" lady Feng inquired with\nalacrity.\n\n\"The decrees of Heaven cannot be divulged; but as I have been very\nfriendly with you, sister-in-law, for so long, I will present you,\nbefore I take my leave, with two lines, which it behoves you to keep in\nmind,\" rejoined Mrs. Ch'in, as she consequently proceeded to recite what\nfollows:\n\n  The three springs, when over, all radiance will wane;\n  The inmates to seek each a home will be fain.\n\nLady Feng was bent upon making further inquiries, when she heard a\nmessenger at the second gate strike the \"cloudy board\" four consecutive\nblows. It was indeed the announcement of a death; and it woke up lady\nFeng with a start. A servant reported that lady Jung of the eastern\nmansion was no more.\n\nLady Feng was so taken aback that a cold perspiration broke out all over\nher person, and she fell for a while into vacant abstraction. But she\nhad to change her costume, with all possible haste, and to come over to\nmadame Wang's apartments.\n\nBy this time, all the members of the family were aware of the tidings,\nand there was not one of them who did not feel disconsolate; one and all\nof them were much wounded at heart. The elder generation bethought\nthemselves of the dutiful submission which she had all along displayed;\nthose of the same age as herself reflected upon the friendship and\nintimacy which had ever existed with her; those younger than her\nremembered her past benevolence. Even the servants of the household,\nwhether old or young, looked back upon her qualities of sympathy with\nthe poor, pity of the destitute, affection for the old, and\nconsideration for the young; and not one of them all was there who did\nnot mourn her loss, and give way to intense grief.\n\nBut these irrelevant details need not be dilated upon; suffice it to\nconfine ourselves to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc.\n\nConsequent upon Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc's return home, he was left to his own self\nand felt very lonely. Neither would he go and disport himself with\nothers; but with the daily return of dusk, he was wont to retire quietly\nto sleep.\n\nOn this day, while he was yet under the influence of a dream, he heard\nthe announcement of Mrs. Ch'in's death, and turning himself round\nquickly he crept out of bed, when he felt as if his heart had been\nstabbed with a sword. With a sudden retch, he straightway expectorated a\nmouthful of blood, which so frightened Hsi Jen and the rest that they\nrushed forward and supported him.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" they inquired, and they meant also to go and let\ndowager lady Chia know, so as to send for a doctor, but Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc dissuaded\nthem.\n\n\"There's no need of any flurry; it's nothing at all,\" he said, \"it's\nsimply that the fire of grief has attacked the heart, and that the blood\ndid not circulate through the arteries.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he speedily raised himself up, and, after asking for his\nclothes and changing, he came over to see dowager lady Chia. His wish\nwas to go at once to the other side; and Hsi Jen, though feeling uneasy\nat heart, seeing the state of mind he was in, did not again hinder him,\nas she felt constrained to let him please himself.\n\nWhen old lady Chia saw that he was bent upon going: \"The breath is just\ngone out of the body,\" she consequently remonstrated, \"and that side is\nstill sullied. In the second place it's now dark, and the wind is high;\nso you had better wait until to-morrow morning, when you will be in\nample time.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc would not agree to this, and dowager lady Chia gave orders to get\nthe carriage ready, and to depute a few more attendants and followers to\ngo with him. Under this escort he went forward and straightway arrived\nin front of the Ning mansion, where they saw the main entrance wide\nopen, the lamps on the two sides giving out a light as bright as day,\nand people coming and going in confused and large numbers; while the\nsound of weeping inside was sufficient to shake the mountains and to\nmove the hills.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc dismounted from the carriage; and with hurried step, walked into\nthe apartment, where the coffin was laid. He gave vent to bitter tears\nfor a few minutes, and subsequently paid his salutations to Mrs. Yu.\nMrs. Yu, as it happened, had just had a relapse of her old complaint of\npains in the stomach and was lying on her bed.\n\nHe eventually came out again from her chamber to salute Chia Chen, just\nat the very moment that Chia Tai-ju, Chia Tai-hsiu, Chia Ch'ih, Chiao\nHsiao, Chia Tun, Chia She, Chia Cheng, Chia Tsung, Chia Pin, Chia Hsing,\nChia Kuang, Chia Shen, Chia Ch'iung, Chia Lin, Chia Se, Chia Ch'ang,\nChia Ling, Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn, Chia Ch'in, Chia Chen, Chia P'ing, Chia Tsao, Chia\nHeng, Chia Fen, Chia Fang, Chia Lan, Chia Chun, Chia Chih and the other\nrelatives of the families had likewise arrived in a body.\n\nChia Chen wept so bitterly that he was like a man of tears. \"Of the\nwhole family, whether young or old, distant relatives or close friends,\"\nhe was just explaining to Chia Tai-ju and the rest, \"who did not know\nthat this girl was a hundred times better than even our son? but now\nthat her spirit has retired, it's evident that this elder branch of the\nfamily will be cut off and that there will be no survivor.\"\n\nWhile he gave vent to these words, he again burst into tears, and the\nwhole company of relatives set to work at once to pacify him. \"She has\nalready departed this life,\" they argued, \"and tears are also of no\navail, besides the pressing thing now is to consult as to what kind of\narrangements are to be made.\"\n\nChia Chen clapped his hands. \"What arrangements are to be made!\" he\nexclaimed; \"nothing is to be done, but what is within my means.\"\n\nAs they conversed, they perceived Ch'in Yeh and Ch'in Chung, as well as\nseveral relations of Mrs. Yu, arrive, together with Mrs. Yu's sisters;\nand Chia Chen forthwith bade Chia Ch'ung, Chia Shen, Chia Lin and Chia\nSe, the four of them, to go and entertain the guests; while he, at the\nsame time, issued directions to go and ask the Astrologer of the\nImperial Observatory to come and choose the days for the ceremonies.\n\n(This Astrologer) decided that the coffin should remain in the house for\nseven times seven days, that is forty-nine days; that after the third\nday, the mourning rites should be begun and the formal cards should be\ndistributed; that all that was to be done during these forty-nine days\nwas to invite one hundred and eight Buddhist bonzes to perform, in the\nmain Hall, the High Confession Mass, in order to ford the souls of\ndeparted relatives across the abyss of suffering, and afterwards to\ntransmute the spirit (of Mrs. Ch'in); that, in addition, an altar should\nbe erected in the Tower of Heavenly Fragrance, where nine times nine\nvirtuous Taoist priests should, for nineteen days, offer up prayers for\nabsolution from punishment, and purification from retribution. That\nafter these services, the tablet should be moved into the Garden of\nConcentrated Fragrance, and that in the presence of the tablet, fifteen\nadditional eminent bonzes and fifteen renowned Taoist Priests should\nconfront the altar and perform meritorious deeds every seven days.\n\nThe news of the death of the wife of his eldest grandson reached Chia\nChing; but as he himself felt sure that, at no distant date, he would\nascend to the regions above, he was loth to return again to his home,\nand so expose himself to the contamination of the world, as to\ncompletely waste the meritorious excellence acquired in past days. For\nthis reason, he paid no heed to the event, but allowed Chia Chen a free\nhand to accomplish the necessary preparations.\n\nChia Chen, to whom we again revert, was fond of display and\nextravagance, so that he found, on inspection of coffins, those few made\nof pine-wood unsuitable to his taste; when, strange coincidence, Hs\u00c3\u00bceh\nP'an came to pay his visit of condolence, and perceiving that Chia Chen\nwas in quest of a good coffin: \"In our establishment,\" he readily\nsuggested, \"we have a lot of timber of some kind or other called Ch'iang\nwood, which comes from the T'ieh Wang Mount, in Huang Hai; and which\nmade into coffins will not rot, not for ten thousand years. This lot\nwas, in fact, brought down, some years back, by my late father; and had\nat one time been required by His Highness I Chung, a Prince of the royal\nblood; but as he became guilty of some mismanagement, it was, in\nconsequence, not used, and is still lying stored up in our\nestablishment; and another thing besides is that there's no one with the\nmeans to purchase it. But if you do want it, you should come and have a\nlook at it.\"\n\nChia Chen, upon hearing this, was extremely delighted, and gave orders\nthat the planks should be there and then brought over. When the whole\nfamily came to inspect them, they found those for the sides and the\nbottom to be all eight inches thick, the grain like betel-nut, the smell\nlike sandal-wood or musk, while, when tapped with the hand, the sound\nemitted was like that of precious stones; so that one and all agreed in\npraising the timber for its remarkable quality.\n\n\"What is their price?\" Chia Chen inquired with a smile.\n\n\"Even with one thousand taels in hand,\" explained Hs\u00c3\u00bceh P'an laughingly,\n\"I feel sure you wouldn't find any place, where you could buy the like.\nWhy ask about price? if you just give the workmen a few taels for their\nlabour, it will be quite sufficient.\"\n\nChia Chen, at these words, lost no time in giving expression to profuse\nassurances of gratitude, and was forthwith issuing directions that the\ntimber should be split, sawn and made up, when Chia Cheng proffered his\nadvice. \"Such articles shouldn't,\" he said, \"be, in my idea, enjoyed by\npersons of the common run; it would be quite ample if the body were\nplaced in a coffin made of pine of the best quality.\"\n\nBut Chia Chen would not listen to any suggestion.\n\nSuddenly he further heard that Mrs. Ch'in's waiting-maid, Jui Chu by\nname, had, after she had become alive to the fact that her mistress had\ndied, knocked her head against a post, and likewise succumbed to the\nblows. This unusual occurrence the whole clan extolled in high terms;\nand Chia Chen promptly directed that, with regard to ceremonies, she\nshould be treated as a granddaughter, and that the body should, after it\nhad been placed in the coffin, be also deposited in the Hall of Attained\nImmortality, in the Garden of Concentrated Fragrance.\n\nThere was likewise a young waiting-maid, called Pao Chu, who, as Mrs.\nCh'in left no issue, was willing to become an adopted child, and begged\nto be allowed to undertake the charge of dashing the mourning bowl, and\naccompanying the coffin; which pleased Chia Chen so much that he\nspeedily transmitted orders that from that time forth Pao Chu should be\naddressed by all as 'young miss.'\n\nPao Chu, after the rites of an unmarried daughter, mourned before the\ncoffin to such an unwonted degree, as if bent upon snapping her own\nlife; while the members of the entire clan, as well as the inmates of\nthe Mansions, each and all, readily observed, in their conduct, the\nestablished mourning usages, without of course any transgression or\nconfusion.\n\n\"Chia Jung,\" pondered Chia Chen, \"has no higher status than that of\ngraduate by purchase, and were this designation written on the funeral\nstreamer, it will not be imposing, and, in point of fact, the retinue\nwill likewise be small.\" He therefore was exceedingly unhappy, in his\nown mind, when, as luck would have it, on this day, which was the fourth\nday of the first seven, Tai Ch'\u00c3\u00bcan, a eunuch of the Palace of High\nRenown, whose office was that of Palace Overseer, first prepared\nsacrificial presents, which he sent round by messengers, and next came\nhimself in an official chair, preceded by criers beating the gong, to\noffer sacrificial oblations.\n\nChia Chen promptly received him, and pressed him into a seat; and when\nthey adjourned into the Hall of the Loitering Bees, tea was presented.\n\nChia Chen had already arrived at a fixed purpose, so that he seized an\nopportunity to tell him of his wish to purchase an office for Chia\nJung's advancement.\n\nTai Ch'\u00c3\u00bcan understood the purport of his remark. \"It is, I presume,\" he\nadded smilingly, \"that the funeral rites should be a little more\nsumptuous.\"\n\n\"My worthy sir,\" eagerly rejoined Chia Chen, \"your surmise on that score\nis perfectly correct.\"\n\n\"The question,\" explained Tai Ch'\u00c3\u00bcan, \"comes up at an opportune moment;\nfor there is just at present a good vacancy. Of the three hundred\nofficers who at present constitute the Imperial Body Guard, there are\ntwo wanting. Yesterday marquis Hsiang Yang's third brother came to\nappeal to me with one thousand five hundred taels of ready money, which\nhe brought over to my house. You know the friendship of old standing\nwhich exists between him and me, so that, placing other considerations\naside, I without a second thought, assented for his father's sake. But\nthere still remains another vacancy, which, who would have thought it,\nfat general Feng, of Yung Hsing, asked to purchase for his son; but I\nhave had no time to give him an answer. Besides, as our child wants to\npurchase it, you had better at once write a statement of his\nantecedents.\"\n\nChia Chen lost no time in bidding some one write the statement on red\npaper, which Tai Ch'\u00c3\u00bcan found, on perusal, to record that Chia Jung was\na graduate, by purchase, of the District of Chiang Ning, of the Ying\nT'ien Prefecture, in Chiang Nan; that Chia Tai-hua, his great\ngrandfather, had been Commander-in-Chief of the Metropolitan Camp, and\nan hereditary general of the first class, with the prefix of Spiritual\nMajesty; that his grandfather Chia Ching was a metropolitan graduate of\nthe tripos in the Ping Ch'en year; and that his father Chia Chen had\ninherited a rank of nobility of the third degree, and was a general,\nwith the prefix of Majestic Intrepidity.\n\nTai Ch'\u00c3\u00bcan, after perusal, turned his hand behind him and passed (the\nstatement) to a constant attendant of his, to put away: \"Go back,\" he\nenjoined him, \"and give it to His Excellency Mr. Chao, at the head of\nthe Board of Revenue, and tell him, that I present him my compliments,\nand would like him to draw up a warrant for subaltern of the Imperial\nBody Guard of the fifth grade, and to also issue a commission; that he\nshould take the particulars from this statement and fill them up; and\nthat to-morrow I'll come and have the money weighed and sent over.\"\n\nThe young attendant signified his obedience, and Tai Ch'\u00c3\u00bcan thereupon\ntook his leave. Chia Chen did all he could to detain him, but with no\nsuccess; so that he had no alternative but to escort him as far as the\nentrance of the Mansion. As he was about to mount into his chair, Chia\nChen inquired, \"As regards the money, shall I go and pay it into the\nBoard, or am I to send it to the Board of Eunuchs?\"\n\n\"If you were to go and pay it at the Board,\" observed Tai Ch'\u00c3\u00bcan; \"you\nare sure to suffer loss; so that it would be better if you just weighed\nexactly one thousand taels and sent them over to my place; for then an\nend will be put to all trouble.\"\n\nChia Chen was incessant in his expression of gratitude. \"When the period\nof mourning has expired,\" he consequently added, \"I shall lead in\nperson, my despicable eldest son to your mansion, to pay our obeisance,\nand express our thanks.\"\n\nThey then parted company, but close upon this, were heard again the\nvoices of runners. It was, in fact, the spouse of Shih Ting, the marquis\nof Chung Ching, who was just arriving. Shih Hsiang-yun, mesdames Wang,\nand Hsing, lady Feng and the rest came out at once, to greet her, and\nlead her into the Main Building; when they further saw the sacrificial\npresents of the three families, of the marquis of Chin Hsiang, the\nmarquis of Ch'uan Ning, and the earl of Shou Shan, likewise spread out\nin front of the tablet.\n\nIn a short while, these three noblemen descended from their chairs, and\nChia Chen received them in the Large Hall. In like manner all the\nrelatives and friends arrived in such quick succession, one coming,\nanother going, that it is impossible to remember even so much as their\nnumber. One thing need be said that during these forty-nine days the\nstreet on which the Ning Kuo mansion stood, was covered with a sheet of\nwhite, formed by the people, coming and going; and thronged with\nclusters of flowers, as the officials came and went.\n\nAt the instance of Chia Chen, Chia Jung, the next day donned his gala\ndress and went over for his papers; and on his return the articles in\nuse in front of the coffin, as well as those belonging to the cortege\nand other such things, were all regulated by the rules prescribed for an\nofficial status of the fifth degree; while, on the tablet and notice\nalike the inscription consisted of: Spirit of lady Ch'in, (by marriage)\nof the Chia mansion, and by patent a lady of the fifth rank (of the\ntitles of honour).\n\nThe main entrance of the Garden of Concentrated Fragrance, adjoining the\nstreet, was opened wide; and on both sides were raised sheds for the\nmusicians, and two companies of players, dressed in blue, discoursed\nmusic at the proper times; while one pair after another of the\nparaphernalia was drawn out so straight as if cut by a knife or slit by\nan axe. There were also two large carmine boards, carved with gilt\ninscriptions, erected outside the gate; the designations in bold\ncharacters on the upper sides being: Guard of the Imperial Antechamber,\ncharged with the protection of the Inner Palace and Roads, in the Red\nProhibited City.\n\nOn the opposite side, facing each other, rose, high above the ground,\ntwo altars for the services of the Buddhist and Taoist priests, while a\nplacard bore the inscription in bold type: Funeral Obsequies of lady\nCh'in, (by marriage) of the Chia mansion, by patent a lady of the fifth\nrank, consort of the eldest grandson of the hereditary duke of Ning Kuo,\nand guard of the Imperial Antechamber, charged with the protection of\nthe Inner Palace and Roads in the Red Prohibited City. We, Wan Hs\u00c3\u00bc, by\nHeaven's commands charged with the perennial preservation of perfect\npeace in the Kingdom of the Four Continents, as well as of the lands\ncontained therein, Head Controller of the School of Void and Asceticism,\nand Superior in Chief (of the Buddhist hierarchy); and Yeh Sheng,\nPrincipal Controller, since the creation, of the Disciples of Perfect\nExcellence and Superior in Chief (of the Taoist priesthood), and others,\nhaving in a reverent spirit purified ourselves by abstinence, now raise\nour eyes up to Heaven, prostrate ourselves humbly before Buddha, and\ndevoutly pray all the Chia Lans, Chieh Tis, Kung Ts'aos and other\ndivinities to extend their sacred bounties, and from afar to display\ntheir spiritual majesty, during the forty-nine days (of the funeral\nrites), for the deliverance from judgment and the absolution from\nretribution (of the spirit of lady Ch'in), so that it may enjoy a\npeaceful and safe passage, whether by sea or by land; and other such\nprayers to this effect, which are in fact not worth the trouble of\nputting on record.\n\nChia Chen had, it is true, all his wishes gratified; but, as his wife\nwas laid up in the inner chambers, with a relapse of her old complaint,\nand was not in a fit state to undertake the direction of the ceremonies,\nhe was very much distressed lest, when the high officials (and their\nwives) came and went, there should occur any breach of the prescribed\nconventionalities, which he was afraid would evoke ridicule. Hence it\nwas that he felt in low spirits; but while he was plunged in solicitude\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, who happened to be close by, readily inquired, \"Everything may\nbe safely looked upon as being satisfactorily settled, and why need you,\nelder brother, still be so full of concern?\"\n\nChia Chen forthwith explained to him how it was that in the ladies'\napartments there was no one (to do the honours), but Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc at these\nwords smiled: \"What difficulty is there about it?\" he remarked; \"I'll\nrecommend some one to take temporary charge of the direction of things\nfor you during the month, and I can guarantee that everything will be\nproperly carried out.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\" Chia Chen was quick to ask; but as Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc perceived that\nthere were still too many relatives and friends seated around, he did\nnot feel as if he could very well speak out; so that he went up to Chia\nChen and whispered a couple of remarks in his ear.\n\nChia Chen's joy knew no bounds when he heard this suggestion.\n\"Everything will indeed be properly carried out,\" he added laughingly;\n\"but I must now be going at once.\"\n\nWith these words, he drew Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc along, and taking leave of the whole\nnumber of visitors, they forthwith came into the drawing rooms.\n\nThis day was luckily not a grand occasion, so that few relatives and\nfriends had come. In the inner apartments there were only a small number\nof ladies of close kinship. Mesdames Hsing and Wang, and lady Feng, and\nthe women of the whole household, were entertaining the guests, when\nthey heard a servant announce that Mr. Chia Chen had come. (This\nannouncement) took the whole body of ladies and young ladies so much by\nsurprise, that, with a rushing sound, they tried to hide in the back\nrooms; but they were not quick enough (to effect their escape).\n\nLady Feng alone composedly stood up. Chia Chen was himself at this time\nrather unwell, and being also very much cut up, he entered the room\nshuffling along, propping himself up with a staff.\n\n\"You are not well?\" therefore remarked madame Hsing and the others, \"and\nyou've had besides so much to attend to during these consecutive days,\nthat what you require is rest to get all right; and why do you again\ncome over?\"\n\nChia Chen was, as he leant on his staff, straining every nerve to bend\nhis body so as to fall on his knees and pay his respects to them, and\nexpress his sense of obligation for the trouble they had taken, when\nmadame Hsing and the other ladies hastily called Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc to raise him up,\nbidding a servant move a chair for him to sit on. Chia Chen would not\ntake a seat; but making an effort to return a smile, \"Your nephew,\" he\nurged, \"has come over, as there's a favour that I want to ask of my two\naunts as well as of my eldest cousin.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" promptly inquired madame Hsing and the rest.\n\n\"My aunts,\" Chia Chen replied with all haste, \"you surely are aware that\nyour grandson's wife is now no more; your nephew's wife is also laid up\nunwell, and, as I see that things in the inner apartments are really not\nwhat they should properly be, I would trouble my worthy eldest cousin to\nundertake in here the direction of affairs for a month; and if she does,\nmy mind will be set at ease.\"\n\nMadame Hsing smiled. \"Is it really about this that you've come?\" she\nasked; \"your eldest cousin is at present staying with your aunt Secunda,\nand all you have to do is to speak to her and it will be all right.\"\n\n\"How ever could a mere child like her,\" speedily remonstrated madame\nWang, \"carry out all these matters? and shouldn't she manage things\nproperly, she will, on the contrary, make people laugh, so it would\ntherefore be better that you should trouble some one else.\"\n\n\"What your ideas are, aunt,\" rejoined Chia Chen smiling, \"your nephew\nhas guessed; you're afraid lest my eldest cousin should have to bear\nfatigue and annoyance; for as to what you say, that she cannot manage\nthings, why my eldest cousin has, from her youth up, ever been in her\nromping and playing so firm and decided; and now that she has entered\nthe married estate, and has the run of affairs in that mansion, she must\nhave reaped so much the more experience, and have become quite an old\nhand! I've been thinking these last few days that outside my eldest\ncousin, there's no one else who could come to my help; and, aunt, if you\ndon't do it for the face of your nephew and your nephew's wife, do it,\nat least, for the affection you bore to her who is no more.\"\n\nWhile he uttered these words tears trickled down his face. The fears\nthat madame Wang inwardly entertained were that lady Feng had no\nexperience in funeral matters, and she apprehended, that if she was not\nequal to managing them, she would incur the ridicule of others; but when\nshe now heard Chia Chen make the appeal in such a disconsolate mood, she\nrelented considerably in her resolution. But as she turned her eyes\ntowards lady Feng (to ascertain her wishes), she saw that she was\nplunged in abstraction.\n\nLady Feng had all along found the greatest zest in taking the initiative\nin everything, with the idea of making a display of her abilities, so\nthat when she perceived how earnest Chia Chen was in his entreaties, she\nhad, at an early period, made up her mind to give a favourable reply.\nSeeing besides madame Wang show signs of relenting, she readily turned\nround and said to her, \"My elder cousin has made his appeal in such a\nsolicitous way that your ladyship should give your consent and have done\nwith it.\"\n\n\"Do you think you are equal to the task?\" inquired madame Wang in a\nwhisper.\n\n\"What's there that I couldn't be equal to?\" replied lady Feng; \"for\nurgent matters outside, my cousin may be said to have already made full\nprovision; and all there is to be done is to keep an eye over things\ninside. But should there occur anything that I don't know, I can ask\nyou, madame, and it will be right.\"\n\nMadame Wang perceiving the reasonableness of what she heard her say,\nuttered not a word, and when Chia Chen saw that lady Feng had assented;\n\"How much you do attend to I don't mind,\" he observed, forcing another\nsmile, \"but I must, in any case, entreat you, cousin, to assume the\nonerous charge. As a first step I'll pay my obeisance to you in here,\nand when everything has been finished, I shall then come over into that\nmansion to express my thanks.\"\n\nWith these words still on his lips, he made a low bow, but lady Feng had\nscarcely had time to return the compliment, before Chia Chen had\ndirected a servant to fetch the warrant of the Ning mansion, which he\nbade Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc hand over to lady Feng.\n\n\"Cousin,\" he added, \"take whatever steps you think best; and if you want\nanything, all you have to do is to simply send for it with this, and\nthere will even be no use to consult me. The only thing I must ask you\nis, not to be too careful in order to save me expense, for the main\nconsideration is that things should be handsomely done. In the second\nplace, it will be well if you were also to treat servants here in the\nsame way as in the other mansion, and not be too scrupulous in the fear\nthat any one might take offence. Outside these two concerns, there's\nnothing else to disturb my mind.\"\n\nLady Feng did not venture to take over the warrant at once, but merely\nturned round to ascertain what were madame Wang's wishes.\n\n\"In view of the reason brother Chen advances,\" madame Wang rejoined,\n\"you had better assume the charge at once and finish with it; don't,\nhowever, act on your own ideas; but when there's aught to be done, be\ncareful and send some one to consult your cousin's wife, ever so little\nthough it be on the subject.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc had already taken over the warrant from Chia Chen's grasp, and\nforcibly handed it to lady Feng, \"Will you, cousin,\" he went on to\nquestion, \"take up your quarters here or will you come every day? should\nyou cross over, day after day, it will be ever so much more fatiguing\nfor you, so that I shall speedily have a separate court got ready for\nyou in here, where you, cousin, can put up for these several days and be\nmore comfortable.\"\n\n\"There's no need,\" replied lady Feng smiling; \"for on that side they\ncan't do without me; and it will be better if I were to come daily.\"\n\n\"Do as you like,\" Chia Chen observed; and after subsequently passing a\nfew more irrelevant remarks, he at length left the room.\n\nAfter a time, the lady relatives dispersed, and madame Wang seized the\nopportunity to inquire of lady Feng, \"What do you purpose doing to-day?\"\n\n\"You had better, please madame, go back,\" urged lady Feng, \"for I must\nfirst of all find out some clue before I can go home.\"\n\nMadame Wang, upon hearing these words, returned to her quarters, in\nadvance, in company with madame Hsing, where we will leave them.\n\nLady Feng meanwhile came into a colonnade, which enclosed a suite of\nthree apartments, and taking a seat, she gave way to reflection. \"The\nfirst consideration,\" she communed within herself, \"is that the\nhousehold is made up of mixed elements, and things might be lost; the\nsecond is that the preparations are under no particular control, with\nthe result that, when the time comes, the servants might shirk their\nduties; the third is that the necessary expenditure being great, there\nwill be reckless disbursements and counterfeit receipts; the fourth,\nthat with the absence of any distinction in the matter of duties,\nwhether large or small, hardship and ease will be unequally shared; and\nthe fifth, that the servants being arrogant, through leniency, those\nwith any self-respect will not brook control, while those devoid of\n'face' will not be able to improve their ways.\"\n\nThese five were, in point of fact, usages in vogue in the Ning mansion.\nBut as you are unable, reader, to ascertain here how lady Feng set\nthings right, listen to the explanations given in the following chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n  Lin Ju-hai dies in the City of Yang Chou.\n  Chia Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc meets the Prince of Pei Ching on the way.\n\n\nWhen Lai Sheng, be it noticed in continuing our story, the major-domo in\nthe Ning Kuo mansion, came to hear that from inside an invitation had\nbeen extended to lady Feng to act as deputy, he summoned together his\nco-workers and other servants. \"Lady Secunda, of the western mansion,\"\nhe harangued them, \"has now been asked to take over the control of\ninternal affairs; and should she come we must, when we apply for\nanything, or have anything to say, be circumspect in our service; we\nshould all every day come early and leave late; and it's better that we\nshould exert ourselves during this one month and take rest after it's\nover. We mustn't throw away our old 'face,' for she's well known to be\nan impetuous thing, with a soured face and a hard heart, who, when\nangry, knows no distinction of persons.\"\n\nThe whole company unanimously admitted that he was right; and one of\ntheir number too observed smilingly, \"It's but right that for the inner\napartments, we should, in fact, get her to come and put things in proper\norder, as everything is very much what it should not be.\"\n\nBut while he uttered these words, they saw Lai Wang's wife coming, with\nan indent in hand, to fetch paper for the supplications and prayers, the\namount of which was mentioned on the order; and they one and all\nhastened to press her into a seat, and to help her to a cup of tea;\nwhile a servant was told to fetch the quantity of paper required. (When\nit was brought,) Lai Wang carried it in his arms and came, the whole way\nwith his wife, as far as the ceremonial gate; when he, at length,\ndelivered it over to her and she clasped it, and walked into the room\nall alone.\n\nLady Feng issued prompt directions to Ts'ai Ming to prepare a register;\nand sending, there and then, for Lai Sheng's wife, she asked her to\nsubmit, for her perusal, the roll with the servants' names. She\nfurthermore fixed upon an early hour of the following day to convene the\ndomestics and their wives in the mansion, in order that they should\nreceive their orders; but, after cursorily glancing over the number of\nentries in the list, and making a few inquiries of Lai Sheng's wife, she\nsoon got into her curricle, and went home.\n\nOn the next day, at six and two quarters, she speedily came over. The\nmatrons and married women of the Ning Kuo mansion assembled together, as\nsoon as they heard of her arrival; but, perceiving lady Feng, assisted\nby Lai Sheng's wife, engaged in apportioning the duties of each servant,\nthey could not presume to intrude, but remained outside the window\nlistening to what was going on.\n\n\"As I've been asked to take over the charge,\" they heard lady Feng\nexplain to Lai Sheng's wife, \"I'm, needless to say, sure to incur the\ndispleasure of you all, for I can't compare with your mistress, who has\nsuch a sweet temper, and allows you to have your own way. But saying\nnothing more of those ways, which prevailed hitherto among your people\nin this mansion, you must now do as I tell you; for on the slightest\ndisregard of my orders, I shall, with no discrimination between those\nwho may be respectable and those who may not be, clearly and distinctly\ncall all alike to account.\"\n\nHaving concluded these remarks, she went on to order Ts'ai Ming to read\nthe roll; and, as their names were uttered, one by one was called in,\nand passed under inspection. After this inspection, which was got over\nin a short time, she continued giving further directions. \"These\ntwenty,\" she said \"should be divided into two companies; ten in each\ncompany, whose sole daily duties should be to attend inside to the\nguests, coming and going, and to serve tea for them; while with any\nother matters, they needn't have anything to do. These other twenty\nshould also be divided into two companies, whose exclusive duties will\nbe, day after day, to look after the tea and eatables of the relatives\nof our family; and these too will have no business to concern themselves\nwith outside matters. These forty will again be divided into two\ncompanies, who will have nothing else to look to than to remain in front\nof the coffin and offer incense, renew the oil, hang up the streamers,\nwatch the coffin, offer sacrifices of rice, and oblations of tea, and\nmourn with the mourners; and neither need they mind anything outside\nthese duties. These four servants will be specially attached to the\ninner tea-rooms to look after cups, saucers and the tea articles\ngenerally; and in the event of the loss of any single thing, the four of\nthem will have to make it good between them. These other four servants\nwill have the sole charge of the articles required for eatables and\nwine; and should any get mislaid compensation will have likewise to be\nmade by them. These eight servants will only have to attend to taking\nover the sacrificial offerings; while these eight will have nothing more\nto see to beyond keeping an eye over the lamps, oil, candles and paper\nwanted everywhere. I'll have a whole supply served out and handed to you\neight to by and by apportion to the various places, in quantities which\nI will determine. These thirty servants are each day, by rotation, to\nkeep watch everywhere during the night, looking after the gates and\nwindows, taking care of the fires and candles, and sweeping the grounds;\nwhile the servants, who remain, are to be divided for duty in the houses\nand rooms, each one having charge of a particular spot. And beginning\nfrom the tables, chairs and curios in each place, up to the very\ncuspidors and brooms, yea even to each blade of grass or sprout of herb,\nwhich may be there, the servants looking after this part will be called\nupon to make good anything that may be either mislaid or damaged. You,\nLai Sheng's wife, will every day have to exercise general supervision\nand inspection; and should there be those who be lazy, any who may\ngamble, drink, fight or wrangle, come at once and report the matter to\nme; and you mustn't show any leniency, for if I come to find it out, I\nshall have no regard to the good old name of three or four generations,\nwhich you may enjoy. You now all have your fixed duties, so that\nwhatever batch of you after this acts contrary to these orders, I shall\nsimply have something to say to that batch and to no one else. The\nservants, who have all along been in my service, carry watches on their\npersons, and things, whether large or small, are invariably done at a\nfixed time. But, in any case, you also have clocks in your master's\nrooms, so that at 6.30, I shall come and read the roll, and at ten\nyou'll have breakfast. Whenever there is any indent of any permits to be\nmade or any report to be submitted, it should be done at 11.30 a.m. and\nno later. At 7 p.m., after the evening paper has been burnt, I shall\ncome to each place in person to hold an inspection; and on my return,\nthe servants on watch for the night will hand over the keys. The next\nday, I shall again come over at 6.30 in the morning; and needless to say\nwe must all do the best we can for these few days; and when the work has\nbeen finished your master is sure to recompense you.\"\n\nWhen she had done speaking, she went on to give orders that tea, oil,\ncandles, feather dusters, brooms and other necessaries should be issued,\naccording to the fixed quantities. She also had furniture, such as\ntable-covers, antimacassars, cushions, rugs, cuspidors, stools and the\nlike brought over and distributed; while, at the same time, she took up\nthe pencil and made a note of the names of the persons in charge of the\nvarious departments, and of the articles taken over by the respective\nservants, in entries remarkable for the utmost perspicacity.\n\nThe whole body of servants received their charge and left; but they all\nhad work to go and attend to; not as in former times, when they were at\nliberty to select for themselves what was convenient to do, while the\narduous work, which remained over, no one could be found to take in\nhand. Neither was it possible for them in the various establishments to\nany longer avail themselves of the confusion to carelessly mislay\nthings. In fact, visitors came and guests left, but everything after all\nwent off quietly, unlike the disorderly way which prevailed hitherto,\nwhen there was no clue to the ravel; and all such abuses as indolence,\nand losses, and the like were completely eradicated.\n\nLady Feng, on her part, (perceiving) the weight her influence had in\nenjoining the observance of her directions, was in her heart exceedingly\ndelighted. But as she saw, that Chia Chen was, in consequence of Mrs.\nYu's indisposition, even so much the more grieved as to take very little\nto drink or to eat, she daily, with her own hands, prepared, in the\nother mansion, every kind of fine congee and luscious small dishes,\nwhich she sent over, in order that he might be tempted to eat.\n\nAnd Chia Lien had likewise given additional directions that every day\nthe finest delicacies should be taken into the ante-chamber, for the\nexclusive use of lady Feng.\n\nLady Feng was not one to shirk exertion and fatigue, so that, day after\nday, she came over at the proper time, called the roll, and managed\nbusiness, sitting all alone in the ante-chamber, and not congregating\nwith the whole bevy of sisters-in-law. Indeed, even when relatives or\nvisitors came or went, she did not go to receive them, or see them off.\n\nThis day was the thirty-fifth day, the very day of the fifth seven, and\nthe whole company of bonzes had just (commenced the services) for\nunclosing the earth, and breaking Hell open; for sending a light to show\nthe way to the departed spirit; for its being admitted to an audience by\nthe king of Hell; for arresting all the malicious devils, as well as for\nsoliciting the soul-saving Buddha to open the golden bridge and to lead\nthe way with streamers. The Taoist priests were engaged in reverently\nreading the prayers; in worshipping the Three Pure Ones and in\nprostrating themselves before the Gemmy Lord. The disciples of\nabstraction were burning incense, in order to release the hungered\nspirits, and were reading the water regrets manual. There was also a\ncompany of twelve nuns of tender years, got up in embroidered dresses,\nand wearing red shoes, who stood before the coffin, silently reading all\nthe incantations for the reception of the spirit (from the lower\nregions,) with the result that the utmost bustle and stir prevailed.\n\nLady Feng, well aware that not a few guests would call on this day, was\nquick to get out of bed at four sharp, to dress her hair and perform her\nablutions. After having completed every arrangement for the day, she\nchanged her costume, washed her hands, and swallowed a couple of\nmouthfuls of milk. By the time she had rinsed her mouth, it was exactly\n6.30; and Lai Wang's wife, at the head of a company of servants, had\nbeen waiting a good long while, when lady Feng appeared in front of the\nEntrance Hall, mounted her carriage and betook herself, preceded by a\npair of transparent horn lanterns, on which were written, in large type,\nthe three characters, Jung Kuo mansion, to the main entrance gate of the\nNing Household. The door lanterns shed brilliant rays from where they\nwere suspended; while on either side the lanterns, of uniform colours,\npropped upright, emitted a lustrous light as bright as day.\n\nThe servants of the family, got up in their mourning clothes, covered\nthe ground far and wide like a white sheet. They stood drawn in two\nrows, and requested that the carriage should drive up to the main\nentrance. The youths retired, and all the married women came forward,\nand raising the curtain of the carriage, lady Feng alighted; and as with\none arm she supported herself on Feng Erh, two married women, with\nlanterns in their hands, lighted the way. Pressed round by the servants,\nlady Feng made her entry. The married women of the Ning mansion advanced\nto greet her, and to pay their respects; and this over, lady Feng, with\ngraceful bearing, entered the Garden of Concentrated Fragrance.\nAscending the Spirit Hall, where the tablet was laid, the tears, as soon\nas she caught sight of the coffin, trickled down her eyes like pearls\nwhose string had snapped; while the youths in the court, and their\nnumber was not small, stood in a reverent posture, with their arms\nagainst their sides, waiting to burn the paper. Lady Feng uttered one\nremark, by way of command: \"Offer the tea and burn the paper!\" when the\nsound of two blows on the gong was heard and the whole band struck up\ntogether. A servant had at an early period placed a large armchair in\nfront of the tablet, and lady Feng sat down, and gave way to loud\nlamentations. Promptly all those, who stood inside or outside, whether\nhigh or low, male or female, took up the note, and kept on wailing and\nweeping until Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu, after a time, sent a message to\nadvise her to withhold her tears; when at length lady Feng desisted.\n\nLai Wang's wife served the tea; and when she had finished rinsing her\nmouth, lady Feng got up; and, taking leave of all the members of the\nclan, she walked all alone into the ante-chamber, where she ascertained,\nin the order of their names, the number of the servants of every\ndenomination in there. They were all found to be present, with the\nexception of one, who had failed to appear, whose duties consisted in\nreceiving and escorting the relatives and visitors. Orders were promptly\ngiven to summon him, and the man appeared in a dreadful fright. \"What!\"\nexclaimed lady Feng, as she forced a smile, \"is it you who have been\nremiss? Is it because you're more respectable than they that you don't\nchoose to listen to my words?\"\n\n\"Your servant,\" he pleaded, \"has come at an early hour every day; and\nit's only to-day that I come late by one step; and I entreat your\nladyship to forgive this my first offence.\"\n\nWhile yet he spoke, she perceived the wife of Wang Hsing, of the Jung\nKuo mansion, come forward and pop her head in to see what was going on;\nbut lady Feng did not let this man go, but went on to inquire of Wang\nHsing's wife what she had come for.\n\nWang Hsing's wife drew near. \"I've come,\" she explained, \"to get an\norder, so as to obtain some thread to make tassels for the carriages and\nchairs.\" Saying this, she produced the permit and handed it up,\nwhereupon lady Feng directed Ts'ai Ming to read the contents aloud. \"For\ntwo large, sedan chairs,\" he said, \"four small sedan chairs and four\ncarriages, are needed in all so many large and small tassels, each\ntassel requiring so many catties of beads and thread.\"\n\nLady Feng finding, after she had heard what was read, that the numbers\n(and quantities) corresponded, forthwith bade Ts'ai Ming make the proper\nentry; and when the order from the Jung Kuo mansion had been fetched,\nand thrown at her, Wang Hsing's wife took her departure.\n\nLady Feng was on the very point of saying something, when she espied\nfour managers of the Jung Kuo mansion walk in; all of whom wanted\npermits to indent for stores. Having asked them to read out the list of\nwhat they required, she ascertained that they wanted four kinds of\narticles in all. Drawing attention to two items: \"These entries,\" she\nremarked, \"are wrong; and you had better go again and make out the\naccount clearly, and then come and fetch a permit.\"\n\nWith these words, she flung down the requisitions, and the two men went\ntheir way in lower spirits than when they had come.\n\nLady Feng then caught sight of the wife of Chang Ts'ai standing by, and\nasked her what was her business, whereupon Chang Ts'ai's wife promptly\nproduced an indent. \"The covers of the carriages and sedan chairs,\" she\nreported, \"have just been completed, and I've come to fetch the amount\ndue to the tailors for wages.\"\n\nLady Feng, upon hearing her explanation, took over the indent, and\ndirected Ts'ai Ming to enter the items in the book. After Wang Hsing had\nhanded over the money, and obtained the receipt of the accountant, duly\nsigned, which tallied with the payment, he subsequently walked away in\ncompany with Chang Ts'ai's wife. Lady Feng simultaneously proceeded to\ngive orders that another indent should be read, which was for money to\npurchase paper with to paste on the windows of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's outer\nschool-room, the repairs to which had been brought to completion, and as\nsoon as lady Feng heard the nature of the application, she there and\nthen gave directions that the permit should be taken over and an entry\nmade, and that the money should be issued after Chang Ts'ai's wife had\ndelivered everything clearly.\n\n\"If to-morrow he were to come late,\" lady Feng then remarked, \"and if\nthe day after, I were to come late; why by and by there'll be no one\nhere at all! I should have liked to have let you off, but if I be\nlenient with you on this first instance, it will be hard for me, on the\noccurrence of another offence, to exercise any control over the rest.\nIt's much better therefore that I should settle accounts with you.\"\n\nThe moment she uttered these words, she put on a serious look, and gave\norders that he should be taken out and administered twenty blows with\nthe bamboo. When the servants perceived that lady Feng was in an angry\nmood, they did not venture to dilly-dally, but dragged him out, and gave\nhim the full number of blows; which done, they came in to report that\nthe punishment had been inflicted.\n\nLady Feng likewise threw down the Ning Mansion order and exclaimed,\naddressing herself to Lai Sheng: \"Cut him a month's wages and rice! and\ntell them all to disperse, and have done with it!\"\n\nAll the servants at length withdrew to attend to their respective\nduties, while the man too, who had been flogged, walked away, as he did\nall he could to conceal his shame and stifle his tears. About this time\narrived and went, in an incessant stream, servants from both the Jung\nand Ning mansions, bent upon applying for permits and returning permits,\nand with one by one again did lady Feng settle accounts. And, as in due\ncourse, the inmates of the Ning mansion came to know how terrible lady\nFeng was, each and all were ever since so wary and dutiful that they did\nnot venture to be lazy.\n\nBut without going into further details on this subject, we shall now\nreturn to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. Seeing that there were a lot of people about and\nfearing lest Ch'in Chung might receive some offence, he lost no time in\ncoming along with him to sit over at lady Feng's. Lady Feng was just\nhaving her repast, and upon seeing them arrive: \"Your legs are long\nenough, and couldn't you have come somewhat quicker!\" she laughingly\nobserved.\n\n\"We've had our rice, thanks,\" replied Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc.\n\n\"Have you had it,\" inquired lady Feng, \"outside here, or over on the\nother side?\"\n\n\"Would we eat anything with all that riff-raff?\" exclaimed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc;\n\"we've really had it over there; in fact, I now come after having had\nmine with dowager lady Chia.\"\n\nAs he uttered these words, they took their seats. Lady Feng had just\nfinished her meal, when a married woman from the Ning mansion came to\nget an order to obtain an advance of money to purchase incense and\nlanterns with.\n\n\"I calculated,\" observed lady Feng, \"that you would come to-day to make\nrequisition, but I was under the impression that you had forgotten; had\nyou really done so you would certainly have had to get them on your own\naccount, and I would have been the one to benefit.\"\n\n\"Didn't I forget? I did,\" rejoined the married woman as she smiled; \"and\nit's only a few minutes back that it came to my mind; had I been one\nsecond later I wouldn't have been in time to get the things.\"\n\nThese words ended, she took over the order and went off. Entries had, at\nthe time to be made in the books, and orders to be issued, and Ch'in\nChung was induced to interpose with a smirk, \"In both these mansions of\nyours, such orders are alike in use; but were any outsider stealthily to\ncounterfeit one and to abscond, after getting the money, what could ever\nbe done?\"\n\n\"In what you say,\" replied lady Feng, \"you take no account of the laws\nof the land.\"\n\n\"How is it that from our house, no one comes to get any orders or to\nobtain anything?\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc having inquired: \"At the time they come to\nfetch them,\" rejoined lady Feng, \"you're still dreaming; but let me ask\nyou one thing, when will you two at last begin your evening course of\nstudies?\"\n\n\"Oh, I wish we were able to begin our studies this very day,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\nadded; \"that would be the best thing, but they're very slow in putting\nthe school-room in order, so that there's no help for it!\"\n\nLady Feng laughed. \"Had you asked me,\" she remarked, \"I can assure you\nit would have been ready quick enough.\"\n\n\"You too would have been of no use,\" observed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"for it will\ncertainly be ready by the time they ought to finish it in.\"\n\n\"But in order that they should do the work,\" suggested lady Feng, \"it's\nalso necessary that they should have the material, they can't do without\nthem; and if I don't give them any permits, it will be difficult to\nobtain them.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc at these words readily drew near to lady Feng, and there and then\napplied for the permits. \"My dear sister,\" he added, \"do give them the\npermits to enable them to obtain the material and effect the repairs.\"\n\n\"I feel quite sore from fatigue,\" ventured lady Feng, \"and how can I\nstand your rubbing against me? but compose your mind. They have this\nvery day got the paper, and gone to paste it; and would they, for\nwhatever they need, have still waited until they had been sent for? they\nare not such fools after all!\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc would not believe it, and lady Feng at once called Ts'ai Ming to\nlook up the list, which she handed for Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's inspection; but while\nthey were arguing a servant came in to announce that Chao Erh, who had\ngone to Su Chow, had returned, and lady Feng all in a flurry directed\nthat he should be asked to walk in. Chao Erh bent one knee and paid his\nobeisance.\n\n\"Why have you come back?\" lady Feng readily inquired.\n\n\"Mr. Secundus (Chia Lien),\" he reported, \"sent me back to tell you that\nMr. Lin (our dowager lady's) son-in-law, died on the third of the ninth\nmoon; that Master Secundus is taking Miss Lin along with him to escort\nthe coffin of Mr. Lin as far as Su Chow; and that they hope to be back\nsome time about the end of the year. Master despatched me to come and\nannounce the news, to bring his compliments, and to crave our old lady's\ninstructions as well as to see how you are getting on in my lady's home.\nHe also bade me take back to him a few long fur pelisses.\"\n\n\"Have you seen any one else besides me?\" lady Feng inquired.\n\n\"I've seen every one,\" rejoined Chao Erh; and withdrew hastily at the\nconclusion of this remark, out of the apartment, while lady Feng turned\ntowards Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc with a smile and said, \"Your cousin Lin can now live in\nour house for ever.\"\n\n\"Poor thing!\" exclaimed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. \"I presume that during all these days\nshe has wept who knows how much;\" and saying this he wrinkled his brow\nand heaved a deep sigh.\n\nLady Feng saw Chao Erh on his return, but as she could not very well, in\nthe presence of third persons, make minute inquiries after Chia Lien,\nshe had to continue a prey to inward solicitude till it was time to go\nhome, for, not having got through what she had to do, she was compelled\nto wait patiently until she went back in the evening, when she again\nsent word for Chao Erh to come in, and asked him with all minuteness\nwhether the journey had been pleasant throughout, and for full\nparticulars. That very night, she got in readiness the long pelisses,\nwhich she herself, with the assistance of P'ing Erh, packed up in a\nbundle; and after careful thought as to what things he would require,\nshe put them in the same bundle and committed them to Chao Erh's care.\nShe went on to solicitously impress upon Chao Erh to be careful in his\nattendance abroad. \"Don't provoke your master to wrath,\" she said, \"and\nfrom time to time do advise him not to drink too much wine; and don't\nentice him to make the acquaintance of any low people; for if you do,\nwhen you come back I will cut your leg off.\"\n\nThe preparations were hurriedly and confusedly completed; and it was\nalready the fourth watch of the night when she went to sleep. But soon\nagain the day dawned, and after hastily performing her toilette and\nablutions, she came over to the Ning Mansion.\n\nAs Chia Chen realised that the day for escorting the body away was\ndrawing nigh, he in person went out in a curricle, along with\ngeomancers, to the Temple of the Iron Fence to inspect a suitable place\nfor depositing the coffin. He also, point by point, enjoined the\nresident managing-bonze, Se K'ung, to mind and get ready brand-new\narticles of decoration and furniture, and to invite a considerable\nnumber of bonzes of note to be at hand to lend their services for the\nreception of the coffin.\n\nSe K'ung lost no time in getting ready the evening meal, but Chia Chen\nhad, in fact, no wish for any tea or rice; and, as the day was far\nadvanced and he was not in time to enter the city, he had, after all, to\nrest during that night as best he could in a \"chaste\" room in the\ntemple. The next morning, as soon as it was day, he hastened to come\ninto the city and to make every preparation for the funeral. He likewise\ndeputed messengers to proceed ahead to the Temple of the Iron Fence to\ngive, that very night, additional decorative touches to the place where\nthe coffin was to be deposited, and to get ready tea and all the other\nnecessaries, for the use of the persons who would be present at the\nreception of the coffin.\n\nLady Feng, seeing that the day was not far distant, also apportioned\nduties and made provision for everything beforehand with circumspect\ncare; while at the same time she chose in the Jung mansion, such\ncarriages, sedan chairs and retinue as were to accompany the cortege, in\nattendance upon madame Wang, and gave her mind furthermore to finding a\nplace where she herself could put up in at the time of the funeral.\nAbout this very time, it happened that the consort of the Duke Shan Kuo\ndeparted this life, and that mesdames Wang and Hsing had likewise to go\nand offer sacrifices, and to follow the burial procession; that the\nbirthday occurred of the consort of Prince Hsi An; that presents had to\nbe forwarded on the occasion of this anniversary; and that the consort\nof the Duke of Chen Kuo gave birth to a first child, a son, and\ncongratulatory gifts had, in like manner, to be provided. Besides, her\nuterine brother Wang Jen was about to return south, with all his family,\nand she had too to write her home letters, to send her reverent\ncompliments to her father and mother, as well as to get the things ready\nthat were to be taken along. There was also Ying Ch'un, who had\ncontracted some illness, and the doctor had every day to be sent for,\nand medicines to be administered, the notes of the doctor to be looked\nafter, consisting of the bulletins of the diagnosis and the\nprescriptions, with the result that the various things that had to be\nattended to by lady Feng were so manifold that it would, indeed, be\ndifficult to give an exhaustive idea of them.\n\nIn addition to all this, the day for taking the coffin away was close at\nhand, so that lady Feng was so hard pressed for time that she had even\nno desire for any tea to drink or anything to eat, and that she could\nnot sit or rest in peace. As soon as she put her foot into the Ning\nmansion, the inmates of the Jung mansion would follow close upon her\nheels; and the moment she got back into the Jung mansion, the servants\nagain of the Ning mansion would follow her about. In spite however of\nthis great pressure, lady Feng, whose natural disposition had ever been\nto try and excel, was urged to strain the least of her energies, as her\nsole dread was lest she should incur unfavourable criticism from any\none; and so excellent were the plans she devised, that every one in the\nclan, whether high or low, readily conceded her unlimited praise.\n\nOn the night of this day, the body had to be watched, and in the inner\nsuite of apartments two companies of young players as well as jugglers\nentertained the relatives, friends and other visitors during the whole\nof the night. Mrs. Yu was still laid up in the inside room, so that the\nwhole task of attending to and entertaining the company devolved upon\nlady Feng alone, who had to look after everything; for though there\nwere, in the whole clan, many sisters-in-law, some there were too\nbashful to speak, others too timid to stand on their feet; while there\nwere also those who were not accustomed to meeting company; and those\nlikewise who were afraid of people of high estate and shy of officials.\nOf every kind there were, but the whole number of them could not come up\nto lady Feng's standard, whose deportment was correct and whose speech\nwas according to rule. Hence it was that she did not even so much as\nheed any of that large company, but gave directions and issued orders,\nadopting any course of action which she fancied, just as if there were\nno bystander.\n\nThe whole night, the lanterns emitted a bright light and the fires\nbrilliant rays; while guests were escorted on their way out and\nofficials greeted on their way in; but of this hundredfold bustle and\nstir nothing need, of course, be said.\n\nThe next morning at the dawn of day, and at a propitious moment,\nsixty-four persons, dressed all alike in blue, carried the coffin,\npreceded by a streamer with the record in large characters: Coffin of\nlady Ch'in, a lady of the fifth degree, (by marriage) of the Chia\nmansion, deceased at middle age, consort of the grandson of the Ning Kuo\nDuke with the first rank title of honour, (whose status is) a guard of\nthe Imperial antechamber, charged with the protection of the Inner\nPalace and Roads in the Red Prohibited City.\n\nThe various paraphernalia and ornaments were all brand-new, hurriedly\nmade for the present occasion, and the uniform lustrous brilliancy they\nshed was sufficient to dazzle the eyes.\n\nPao-chu, of course, observed the rites prescribed for unmarried\ndaughters, and dashed the bowl and walked by the coffin, as she gave way\nto most bitter lamentations.\n\nAt that time, among the officials who escorted the funeral procession,\nwere Niu Chi-tsung, the grandson of the Chen Kuo duke, who had now\ninherited the status of earl of the first degree; Liu Fang, the grandson\nof Liu Piao, duke of Li Kuo, who had recently inherited the rank of\nviscount of the first class; Ch'en Jui-wen, a grandson of Ch'en Yi, duke\nof Ch'i Kuo, who held the hereditary rank of general of the third\ndegree, with the prefix of majestic authority; Ma Shang, the grandson of\nMa K'uei, duke of Chih Kuo, by inheritance general of the third rank\nwith the prefix of majesty afar; Hou Hsiao-keng, an hereditary viscount\nof the first degree, grandson of the duke of Hsiu Kuo, Hou Hsiao-ming by\nname; while the death of the consort of the duke of Shan Kuo had obliged\nhis grandson Shih Kuang-chu to go into mourning so that he could not be\npresent. These were the six families which had, along with the two\nhouseholds of Jung and Ning, been, at one time, designated the eight\ndukes.\n\nAmong the rest, there were besides the grandson of the Prince of Nan An;\nthe grandson of the Prince of Hsi An; Shih Ting, marquis of Chung Ching;\nChiang Tzu-ning, an hereditary baron of the second grade, grandson of\nthe earl of P'ing Yuan; Hsieh K'un, an hereditary baron of the second\norder and Captain of the Metropolitan camp, grandson of the marquis of\nTing Ch'ang: Hsi Chien-hui, an hereditary baron of the second rank, a\ngrandson of the marquis of Nang Yang; Ch'in Liang, in command of the\nFive Cities, grandson of the marquis of Ching T'ien. The remainder were\nWei Chi, the son of the earl of Chin Hsiang; Feng Tzu-ying, the son of a\ngeneral, whose prefix was supernatural martial spirit; Ch'en Yeh-ch\u00c3\u00bcn,\nWei Jo-lan and others, grandsons and sons of princes who could not be\nenumerated.\n\nIn the way of ladies, there were also in all about ten large official\nsedan chairs full of them, thirty or forty private chairs, and including\nthe official and non-official chairs, and carriages containing inmates\nof the household, there must have been over a hundred and ten; so that\nwith the various kinds of paraphernalia, articles of decoration and\nhundreds of nick-nacks, which preceded, the vast expanse of the cortege\ncovered a continuous line extending over three or four li.\n\nThey had not been very long on their way, when they reached variegated\nsheds soaring high by the roadside, in which banquets were spread,\nfeasts laid out, and music discoursed in unison. These were the viatory\nsacrificial offerings contributed by the respective families. The first\nshed contained the sacrificial donations of the mansion of the Prince of\nTung P'ing; the second shed those of the Prince of Nan An; the third\nthose of the Prince of Hsi Ning, and the fourth those of the Prince of\nPei Ching.\n\nIndeed of these four Princes, the reputation enjoyed in former days by\nthe Prince of Pei Ching had been the most exalted, and to this day his\nsons and grandsons still succeeded to the inheritance of the princely\ndignity. The present incumbent of the Princedom of Pei Ching, Shih Jung,\nhad not as yet come of age, but he was gifted with a presence of\nexceptional beauty, and with a disposition condescending and genial. At\nthe demise, recently, of the consort of the eldest grandson of the\nmansion of Ning Kuo, he, in consideration of the friendship which had\nformerly existed between the two grandfathers, by virtue of which they\nhad been inseparable, both in adversity as well as in prosperity,\ntreating each other as if they had not been of different surnames, was\nconsequently induced to pay no regard to princely dignity or to his\nimportance, but having like the others paid, on the previous day, his\ncondolences and presented sacrificial offerings, he had further now\nraised a shed wherein to offer libations. Having directed every one of\nhis subordinate officers to remain in this spot in attendance, he\nhimself went at the fifth watch to court, and when he acquitted himself\nof his public duties he forthwith changed his attire for a mourning\ncostume, and came along, in an official sedan chair, preceded by gongs\nand umbrellas. Upon reaching the front of the shed the chair was\ndeposited on the ground, and as his subordinate officers pressed on\neither side and waited upon him, neither the military nor the populace,\nwhich composed the mass of people, ventured to make any commotion. In a\nshort while, the long procession of the Ning mansion became visible,\nspreading far and wide, covering in its course from the north, the whole\nground like a silver mountain. At an early hour, the forerunners,\nmessengers and other attendants on the staff of the Ning mansion\napprised Chia Chen (of the presence of the sheds), and Chia Chen with\nall alacrity gave orders that the foremost part of the cortege should\nhalt. Attended by Chia She and Chia Chen, the three of them came with\nhurried step to greet (the Prince of Pei Ching), whom they saluted with\ndue ceremony. Shih Jung, who was seated in his sedan chair, made a bow\nand returned their salutations with a smile, proceeding to address them\nand to treat them, as he had done hitherto, as old friends, without any\nairs of self-importance.\n\n\"My daughter's funeral has,\" observed Chia Chen, \"put your Highness to\nthe trouble of coming, an honour which we, though noble by birth, do not\ndeserve.\"\n\nShih Jung smiled. \"With the terms of friendship,\" he added, \"which have\nexisted for so many generations (between our families), is there any\nneed for such apologies?\"\n\nTurning his head round there and then, he gave directions to the senior\nofficer of his household to preside at the sacrifices and to offer\nlibations in his stead; and Chia She and the others stood together on\none side and made obeisance in return, and then came in person again and\ngave expression to their gratitude for his bounty.\n\nShih Jung was most affable and complaisant. \"Which is the gentleman,\" he\ninquired of Chia Chen, \"who was born with a piece of jade in his mouth?\nI've long had a wish to have the pleasure of seeing him, and as he's\nsure to be on the spot on an occasion like this, why shouldn't you\ninvite him to come round?\"\n\nChia Chen speedily drew back, and bidding Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc change his mourning\nclothes, he led him forward and presented him.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc had all along heard that Shih Jung was a worthy Prince, perfect\nin ability as well as in appearance, pleasant and courteous, not bound\ndown by any official custom or state rite, so that he had repeatedly\nfelt a keen desire to meet him. With the sharp control, however, which\nhis father exercised over him, he had not been able to gratify his wish.\nBut on this occasion, he saw on the contrary that he came to call him,\nand it was but natural that he should be delighted. Whilst advancing, he\nscrutinised Shih Jung with the corner of his eye, who, seated as he was\nin the sedan chair, presented an imposing sight.\n\nBut, reader, what occurred on his approach is not yet known, but listen\nto the next chapter, which will divulge it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n  Lady Peng, n\u00c3\u00a9e Wang, exercises her authority in the Iron Fence Temple.\n  Ch'in Ching-ch'ing (Ch'ing Chung) amuses himself in the Man-t'ou\n      (Bread) nunnery.\n\n\nBut we shall now resume our story. When Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc raised his eyes, he\nnoticed that Shih Jung, Prince of Pei Ching, wore on his head a princely\ncap with pure white tassels and silvery feathers, that he was appareled\nin a white ceremonial robe, (with a pattern representing) the toothlike\nripple of a river and the waters of the sea, embroidered with\nfive-clawed dragons; and that he was girded with a red leather belt,\ninlaid with white jade. That his face was like a beauteous gem; that his\neyes were like sparkling stars; and that he was, in very truth, a human\nbeing full of graceful charms.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc hastily pressed forward and made a reverent obeisance, and Shih\nJung lost no time in extending his arms from inside the sedan-chair, and\nembracing him. At a glance, he saw that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had on his head a silver\ncap, to which the hair was attached, that he had, round his forehead, a\nflap on which were embroidered a couple of dragons issuing from the sea,\nthat he wore a white archery-sleeved robe, ornamented with dragons, and\nthat his waist was encircled by a silver belt, inlaid with pearls; that\nhis face resembled vernal flowers and that his eyes were like drops of\nlacquer.\n\nShih Jung smiled. \"Your name is,\" he said, \"no trumped-up story; for\nyou, verily, resemble a precious gem; but where's the valuable trinket\nyou had in your mouth?\" he inquired.\n\nAs soon as Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc heard this inquiry, he hastened to produce the jade\nfrom inside his clothes and to hand it over to Shih Jung. Shih Jung\nminutely examined it; and having also read the motto on it, he\nconsequently ascertained whether it was really efficacious or not.\n\n\"It's true that it's said to be,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc promptly explained, \"but it\nhasn't yet been put to the test.\"\n\nShih Jung extolled it with unbounded praise, and, as he did so, he set\nthe variegated tassels in proper order, and, with his own hands,\nattached it on to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's neck. Taking also his hand in his, he\ninquired of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc what was his age? and what books he was reading at\npresent, to each of which questions Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc gave suitable answer.\n\nShih Jung perceiving the perspicacity of his speech and the propriety of\nhis utterances, simultaneously turned towards Chia Chen and observed\nwith a smile on his face: \"Your worthy son is, in very truth, like the\nyoung of a dragon or like the nestling of a phoenix! and this isn't an\nidle compliment which I, a despicable prince, utter in your venerable\npresence! But how much more glorious will be, in the future, the voice\nof the young phoenix than that of the old phoenix, it isn't easy to\nascertain.\"\n\nChia Chen forced a smile: \"My cur-like son,\" he replied, \"cannot presume\nto such bountiful praise and golden commendation; but if, by the virtue\nof your Highness' excess of happiness, he does indeed realise your\nwords, he will be a source of joy to us all!\"\n\n\"There's one thing, however,\" continued Shih Jung; \"with the excellent\nabilities which your worthy scion possesses, he's sure, I presume, to be\nextremely loved by her dowager ladyship, (his grandmother), and by all\nclasses. But for young men of our age it's a great drawback to be doated\nupon, for with over-fondness, we cannot help utterly frustrating the\nbenefits of education. When I, a despicable prince, was young, I walked\nin this very track, and I presume that your honourable son cannot\nlikewise but do the same. By remaining at home, your worthy scion will\nfind it difficult to devote his attention to study; and he will not reap\nany harm, were he to come, at frequent intervals, to my humble home; for\nthough my deserts be small, I nevertheless enjoy the great honour of the\nacquaintance of all the scholars of note in the Empire, so that,\nwhenever any of them visit the capital, not one of them is there who\ndoes not lower his blue eyes upon me. Hence it is that in my mean abode,\neminent worthies rendezvous; and were your esteemed son to come, as\noften as he can, and converse with them and meet them, his knowledge\nwould, in that case, have every opportunity of making daily strides\ntowards improvement.\"\n\nChia Chen speedily bent his body and expressed his acquiescence, by way\nof reply; whereupon Shih Jung went further, and taking off from his\nwrist a chaplet of pearls, he presented it to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc.\n\n\"This is the first time we meet,\" he observed. \"Our meeting was so\nunexpected that I have no suitable congratulatory present to offer you.\nThis was conferred upon me by His Majesty, and is a string of\nchaplet-pearls, scented with Ling Ling, which will serve as a temporary\ntoken of respectful congratulations.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc hastened to receive it from his hands, and turning round, he\nreverently presented it to Chia Chen. Chia Chen and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc jointly\nreturned thanks; and forthwith Chia She, Chia Chen and the rest came\nforward in a body, and requested the Prince to turn his chair homewards.\n\n\"The departed,\" expostulated Shih Jung, \"has already ascended the\nspiritual regions, and is no more a mortal being in this dusty world\nexposed to vicissitude like you and I. Although a mean prince like me\nhas been the recipient of the favour of the Emperor, and has\nundeservedly been called to the princely inheritance, how could I\npresume to go before the spiritual hearse and return home?\"\n\nChia She and the others, perceiving how persistent he was in his refusal\nhad no course but to take their leave, express their sense of gratitude\nand to rejoin the cortege. They issued orders to their servants to stop\nthe band, and to hush the music, and making the procession go by, they\nat length left the way clear for Shih Jung to prosecute his way.\n\nBut we will now leave him and resume our account of the funeral of the\nNing mansion. All along its course the road was plunged in unusual\ncommotion. As soon as they reached the city gates Chia She, Chia Cheng,\nChia Chen, and the others again received donations from all their fellow\nofficers and subordinates, in sacrificial sheds erected by their\nrespective families, and after they returned thanks to one after\nanother, they eventually issued from the city walls, and proceeded\neventually along the highway, in the direction of the Temple of the Iron\nFence.\n\nChia Chen, at this time, went, together with Chia Jung, up to all their\nseniors, and pressed them to get into their sedan chairs, and to ride\ntheir horses; and Chia She and all of the same age as himself were\nconsequently induced to mount into their respective carriages or chairs.\nChia Chen and those of the same generation were likewise about to ride\ntheir horses, when lady Feng, through her solicitude on Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's\naccount, gave way to fears lest now that they had reached the open\ncountry, he should do as he pleased, and not listen to the words of any\nof the household, and lest Chia Chen should not be able to keep him in\ncheck; and, as she dreaded that he might go astray, she felt compelled\nto bid a youth call him to her; and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had no help but to appear\nbefore her curricle.\n\n\"My dear brother,\" lady Feng remarked smiling, \"you are a respectable\nperson, and like a girl in your ways, and shouldn't imitate those\nmonkeys on horseback! do get down and let both you and I sit together in\nthis carriage; and won't that be nice?\"\n\nAt these words, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc readily dismounted and climbed up into the\ncarriage occupied by lady Feng; and they both talked and laughed, as\nthey continued their way.\n\nBut not a long time elapsed before two men, on horseback, were seen\napproaching from the opposite direction. Coming straight up to lady\nFeng's vehicle they dismounted, and said, as they leaned on the sides of\nher carriage, \"There's a halting place here, and will it not please your\nladyship to have a rest and change?\"\n\nLady Feng directed them to ask the two ladies Hsing and Wang what they\nwould like to do, and the two men explained: \"These ladies have\nsignified that they had no desire to rest, and they wish your ladyship\nto suit your convenience.\"\n\nLady Feng speedily issued orders that they should have a rest, before\nthey prosecuted their way, and the servant youth led the harnessed\nhorses through the crowd of people and came towards the north, while\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, from inside the carriage, urgently asked that Mr. Ch'in should\nbe requested to come.\n\nCh'in Chung was at this moment on horseback following in the track of\nhis father's carriage, when unexpectedly he caught sight of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's\npage, come at a running pace and invite him to have some refreshment.\nCh'in Chung perceived from a distance that the horse, which Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had\nbeen riding, walked behind lady Feng's vehicle, as it went towards the\nnorth, with its saddle and bridles all piled up, and readily concluding\nthat Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc must be in the same carriage with that lady, he too turned\nhis horse and came over in haste and entered, in their company, the door\nof a farm-house.\n\nThis dwelling of the farmer's did not contain many rooms so that the\nwomen and girls had nowhere to get out of the way; and when the village\nlasses and country women perceived the bearing and costumes of lady\nFeng, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, and Ch'in Chung, they were inclined to suspect that\ncelestial beings had descended into the world.\n\nLady Feng entered a thatched house, and, in the first place, asked\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc and the rest to go out and play. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc took the hint, and, along\nwith Ch'in Chung, he led off the servant boys and went to romp all over\nthe place.\n\nThe various articles in use among the farmers they had not seen before,\nwith the result that after Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had inspected them, he thought them\nall very strange; but he could neither make out their names nor their\nuses. But among the servant boys, there were those who knew, and they\nexplained to them, one after another, what they were called, as well as\nwhat they were for. As Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, after this explanation, nodded his head;\n\"It isn't strange,\" he said, \"that an old writer has this line in his\npoetical works, 'Who can realise that the food in a bowl is, grain by\ngrain, all the fruit of labour.' This is indeed so!\" As he spoke, they\nhad come into another house; and at the sight of a spinning wheel on a\nstove-bed, they thought it still more strange and wonderful, but the\nservant boys again told them that it was used for spinning the yarn to\nweave cloth with, and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc speedily jumping on to the stove-bed, set\nto work turning the wheel for the sake of fun, when a village lass of\nabout seventeen or eighteen years of age came forward, and asked them\nnot to meddle with it and spoil it.\n\nThe servant boys promptly stopped her interference; but Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc himself\ndesisted, as he added: \"It's because I hadn't seen one before that I\ncame to try it for fun.\"\n\n\"You people can't do it,\" rejoined the lass, \"let me turn it for you to\nsee.\"\n\nCh'in Chung secretly pulled Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc and remarked, \"It's great fun in this\nvillage!\" but Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc gave him a nudge and observed, \"If you talk\nnonsense again, I'll beat you.\" Watching intently, as he uttered these\nwords, the village girl who started reeling the thread, and presented,\nin very truth, a pretty sight. But suddenly an old woman from the other\nside gave a shout. \"My girl Secunda, come over at once;\" and the lass\ndiscarded the spinning-wheel and hastily went on her way.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc was the while feeling disappointed and unhappy, when he espied a\nservant, whom lady Feng had sent, come and call them both in. Lady Feng\nhad washed her hands and changed her costume; and asked him whether he\nwould change or not, and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, having replied \"No! it doesn't matter\nafter all if I don't change,\" the female attendants served tea, cakes\nand fruits and also poured the scented tea. Lady Feng and the others\ndrank their tea, and waiting until they had put the various articles by,\nand made all the preparations, they promptly started to get into their\ncarriages. Outside, Wang Erh had got ready tips and gave them to the\npeople of the farm, and the farm women and all the inmates went up to\nthem to express their gratitude; but when Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc came to look carefully,\nhe failed to see anything of the lass who had reeled the thread. But\nthey had not gone far before they caught sight of this girl Secunda\ncoming along with a small child in her arms, who, they concluded, was\nher young brother, laughing and chatting, in company with a few young\ngirls.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc could not suppress the voice of love, but being seated in the\ncarriage, he was compelled to satisfy himself by following her with his\neyes. Soon however the vehicle sped on as rapidly as a cloud impelled by\nthe wind, so that when he turned his head round, there was already no\nvestige to be seen of her; but, while they were bandying words, they had\nunexpectedly overtaken the great concourse of the cortege.\n\nLikewise, at an early stage men were stationed ahead, with Buddhist\ndrums and gold cymbals, with streamers, and jewelled coverings; and the\nwhole company of bonzes, belonging to the Iron Fence Temple, had already\nbeen drawn out in a line by the sides of the road. In a short while,\nthey reached the interior of the temple, where additional sacrifices\nwere offered and Buddhistic services performed; and where altars had\nagain been erected to burn incense on. The coffin was deposited in a\nside room of the inner court; and Pao Chu got ready a bed-room in which\nshe could keep her watch.\n\nIn the outer apartments, Chia Chen did the honours among the whole party\nof relatives and friends, some of whom asked to be allowed to stay for\ntheir meals, while others at this stage took their leave. And after they\nhad one by one returned thanks, the dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts\nand barons, each in respective batches, (got up to go,) and they kept on\nleaving from between 1 and 3 p.m. before they had finally all dispersed.\n\nIn the inner Chambers, the ladies were solely entertained and attended\nto by lady Feng. First to make a move were the consorts of officials;\nand noon had also come, by the time the whole party of them had taken\ntheir departure. Those that remained were simply a few relatives of the\nsame clan and others like them, who eventually left after the completion\nof the three days' rationalistic liturgies.\n\nThe two ladies Hsing and Wang, well aware at this time that lady Feng\ncould on no account return home, desired to enter the city at once; and\nmadame Wang wanted to take Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc home; but Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, who had, on an\nunexpected occasion, come out into the country, entertained, of course,\nno wish to go back; and he would agree to nothing else than to stay\nbehind with lady Feng, so that madame Wang had no alternative but to\nhand him over to her charge and to start.\n\nThis Temple of the Iron Fence had, in fact, been erected in days gone\nby, at the expense of the two dukes Ning and Jung; and there still\nremained up to these days, acres of land, from which were derived the\nfunds for incense and lights for such occasions, on which the coffins of\nany members, old or young, (who died) in the capital, had to be\ndeposited in this temple; and the inner and outer houses, in this\ncompound were all kept in readiness and good order, for the\naccommodation of those who formed part of the cort\u00c3\u00a8ge.\n\nAt this time, as it happened, the descendants mustered an immense crowd,\nand among them were poor and rich of various degrees, or with likes and\ndislikes diametrically opposed. There were those, who, being in\nstraitened circumstances at home, and easily contented, readily took up\ntheir quarters in the temple. And there were those with money and\nposition, and with extravagant ideas, who maintained that the\naccommodation in the temple was not suitable, and, of course, went in\nsearch of additional quarters, either in country houses, or in convents,\nwhere they could have their meals and retire, after the ceremonies were\nover.\n\nOn the occasion of Mrs. Ch'in's funeral, all the members of the clan put\nup temporarily in the Iron Fence Temple; lady Feng alone looked down\nupon it as inconvenient, and consequently despatched a servant to go and\ntell Ch'ing Hs\u00c3\u00bc, a nun in the Bread Convent, to empty two rooms for her\nto go and live in.\n\nThis Bread Convent had at one time been styled the Shui Yueh nunnery\n(water moon); but as good bread was made in that temple, it gave rise to\nthis nickname.\n\nThis convent was not very distant from the Temple of the Iron Fence, so\nthat as soon as the bonzes brought their functions to a close, and the\nsacrifice of evening was offered, Chia Chen asked Chia Jung to request\nlady Feng to retire to rest; and as lady Feng perceived that there still\nremained several sisters-in-law to keep company to the female relatives,\nshe readily, of her own accord, took leave of the whole party, and,\nalong with Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc and Ch'in Chung, came to the Water Moon Convent.\n\nCh'in Yeh, it must be noticed, was advanced in years and a victim to\nmany ailments, so that he was unable to remain in the temple long, and\nhe bade Ch'in Chung tarry until the coffin had been set in its resting\nplace, with the result that Ch'in Chung came along, at the same time as\nlady Feng and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, to the Water Moon Convent, where Ch'ing Hs\u00c3\u00bc\nappeared, together with two neophytes, Chih Shan and Chih Neng, to\nreceive them. After they had exchanged greetings, lady Feng and the\nothers entered the \"chaste\" apartments to change their clothes and wash\ntheir hands; and when they had done, as she perceived how much taller in\nstature Chih Neng had grown and how much handsomer were her features,\nshe felt prompted to inquire, \"How is it that your prioress and\nyourselves haven't been all these days as far as our place?\"\n\n\"It's because during these days we haven't had any time which we could\ncall our own,\" explained Ch'ing Hs\u00c3\u00bc. \"Owing to the birth of a son in Mr.\nHu's mansion, dame Hu sent over about ten taels and asked that we should\ninvite several head-nuns to read during three days the service for the\nchurching of women, with the result that we've been so very busy and had\nso little leisure, that we couldn't come over to pay our respects to\nyour ladyship.\"\n\nBut leaving aside the old nun, who kept lady Feng company, we will now\nreturn to the two lads Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc and Ch'in Chung. They were up to their\npranks in the main building of the convent, when seeing Chih Neng come\nover: \"Here's Neng Erh,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc exclaimed with a smile.\n\n\"Why notice a creature like her?\" remarked Ch'in Chung; to which Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\nrejoined laughingly: \"Don't be sly! why then did you the other day, when\nyou were in the old lady's rooms, and there was not a soul present, hold\nher in your arms? and do you want to fool me now ?\"\n\n\"There was nothing of the kind,\" observed Ch'in Chung smiling.\n\n\"Whether there was or not,\" replied Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"doesn't concern me; but if\nyou will stop her and tell her to pour a cup of tea and bring it to me\nto drink, I'll then keep hands off.\"\n\n\"This is indeed very strange!\" Ch'in Chung answered laughing; \"do you\nfear that if you told her to pour you one, that she wouldn't; and what\nneed is there that I should tell her?\"\n\n\"If I ask her,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc observed, \"to pour it, she wouldn't be as ready\nas she would were you to tell her about it.\"\n\nCh'in Chung had no help but to speak. \"Neng Erh!\" he said, \"bring a cup\nof tea.\"\n\nThis Neng Erh had, since her youth, been in and out of the Jung mansion,\nso that there was no one that she did not know; and she had also, time\nafter time, romped and laughed with Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc and Ch'in Chung. Being now\ngrown up she gradually came to know the import of love, and she readily\ntook a fancy to Ch'in Chung, who was an amorous being. Ch'in Chung too\nreturned her affection, on account of her good looks; and, although he\nand she had not had any very affectionate t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aates, they had,\nhowever, long ago come to understand each other's feelings and wishes.\n\nChih Neng walked away and returned after having poured the tea.\n\n\"Give it to me,\" Ch'in Chung cried out smirkingly; while Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc likewise\nshouted: \"Give it to me.\"\n\nChih Neng compressed her lips and sneeringly rejoined, \"Are you going to\nhave a fight even over a cup of tea? Is it forsooth likely that there's\nhoney in my hand?\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc was the first to grasp and take over the cup, but while drinking\nit, he was about to make some inquiry, when he caught sight of Chih\nShan, who came and called Chih Neng away to go and lay the plates with\nfruit on the table. Not much time elapsed before she came round to\nrequest the two lads to go and have tea and refreshments; but would they\neat such things as were laid before them? They simply sat for a while\nand came out again and resumed their play.\n\nLady Feng too stayed for a few moments, and then returned, with the old\nnun as her escort, into the \"unsullied\" rooms to lie down. By this time,\nall the matrons and married women discovered that there was nothing else\nto be done, and they dispersed in succession, retiring each to rest.\nThere only remained in attendance several young girls who enjoyed her\nconfidence, and the old nun speedily availed herself of the opportunity\nto speak. \"I've got something,\" she said, \"about which I mean to go to\nyour mansion to beg of madame Wang; but I'll first request you, my lady,\nto tell me how to set to work.\"\n\n\"What's it?\" ascertained lady Feng.\n\n\"O-mi-to-fu!\" exclaimed the old nun, \"It's this; in days gone by, I\nfirst lived in the Ch'ang An district. When I became a nun and entered\nthe monastery of Excellent Merit, there lived, at that time, a\nsubscriber, Chang by surname, a very wealthy man. He had a daughter,\nwhose infant name was Chin Ko; the whole family came in the course of\nthat year to the convent I was in, to offer incense, and as luck would\nhave it they met Li Ya-nei, a brother of a secondary wife of the Prefect\nof the Ch'ang An Prefecture. This Li Ya-nei fell in love at first sight\nwith her, and would wed Chin Ko as his wife. He sent go-betweens to ask\nher in marriage, but, contrary to his expectations, Chin Ko had already\nreceived the engagement presents of the son of the ex-Major of the\nCh'ang An Prefecture. The Chang family, on the other hand, were afraid\nthat if they withdrew from the match, the Major would not give up his\nclaim, and they therefore replied that she was already promised to\nanother. But, who would have thought it, this Mr. Li was seriously bent\nupon marrying the young lady. But while the Chang family were at a loss\nwhat plan to devise, and both parties were in a dilemma, the family of\nthe Major came unexpectedly to hear of the news; and without even\nlooking thoroughly into the matter, they there and then had recourse to\ninsult and abuse. 'Is a girl,' they insinuated, 'to be promised to the\nsons of several families!' And obstinately refusing to allow the\nrestitution of the betrothal presents, they at once had recourse to\nlitigation and brought an action (against the girl's people.) That\nfamily was at their wits' end, and had no alternative but to find some\none to go to the capital to obtain means of assistance; and, losing all\npatience, they insisted upon the return of the presents. I believe that\nthe present commander of the troops at Ch'ang An, Mr. Y\u00c3\u00bcn, is on\nfriendly terms with your honourable family, and could one solicit madame\nWang to put in a word with Mr. Chia Cheng to send a letter and ask Mr.\nY\u00c3\u00bcn to speak to that Major, I have no fear that he will not agree.\nShould (your ladyship) be willing to take action, the Chang family are\neven ready to present all they have, though it may entail the ruin of\ntheir estate.\"\n\n\"This affair is, it's true, of no great moment,\" lady Feng replied\nsmiling, after hearing this appeal; \"but the only thing is that madame\nWang does no longer attend to matters of this nature.\"\n\n\"If madame doesn't heed them,\" suggested the old nun, \"you, my lady, can\nsafely assume the direction.\"\n\n\"I'm neither in need of any money to spend,\" added lady Feng with a\nsmirk, \"nor do I undertake such matters!\"\n\nThese words did not escape Ching Hs\u00c3\u00bc's ear; they scattered to the winds\nher vain hopes. After a minute or so she heaved a sigh.\n\n\"What you say may be true enough,\" she remarked; \"but the Chang family\nare also aware that I mean to come and make my appeal to your mansion;\nand were you now not to manage this affair, the Chang family having no\nidea that the lack of time prevents any steps being taken and that no\nimportance is attached to their presents, it will appear, on the\ncontrary, as if there were not even this little particle of skill in\nyour household.\"\n\nAt these words lady Feng felt at once inspirited. \"You've known of old,\"\nshe added, \"that I've never had any faith in anything concerning\nretribution in the Court of Judgment in the unseen or in hell; and that\nwhatever I say that I shall do, that I do; tell them therefore to bring\nthree thousand taels; and I shall then remedy this grievance of theirs.\"\n\nThe old nun upon hearing this remark was so exceedingly delighted, that\nshe precipitately exclaimed, \"They've got it, they've got it! there will\nbe no difficulty about it.\"\n\n\"I'm not,\" lady Feng went on to add, \"like those people, who afford help\nand render assistance with an eye to money; these three thousand taels\nwill be exclusively devoted for the travelling expenses of those youths,\nwho will be sent to deliver messages and for them to make a few cash for\ntheir trouble; but as for me I don't want even so much as a cash. In\nfact I'm able at this very moment to produce as much as thirty thousand\ntaels.\"\n\nThe old nun assented with alacrity, and said by way of reply, \"If that\nbe so, my lady, do display your charitable bounty at once to-morrow and\nbring things to an end.\"\n\n\"Just see,\" remarked lady Feng, \"how hard pressed I am; which place can\ndo without me? but since I've given you my word, I shall, needless to\nsay, speedily bring the matter to a close.\"\n\n\"A small trifle like this,\" hinted the old nun, \"would, if placed in the\nhands of any one else, flurry her to such an extent that she would be\nquite at a loss what to do; but in your hands, my lady, even if much\nmore were superadded, it wouldn't require as much exertion as a wave of\nyour hand. But the proverb well says: 'that those who are able have much\nto do;' for madame Wang, seeing that your ladyship manages all concerns,\nwhether large or small, properly, has still more shoved the burden of\neverything on your shoulders, my lady; but you should, it's but right,\nalso take good care of your precious health.\"\n\nThis string of flattery pleased lady Feng more and more, so that\nheedless of fatigue she went on to chat with still greater zest.\n\nBut, thing unthought of, Ch'in Chung availed himself of the darkness, as\nwell as of the absence of any one about, to come in quest of Chih Neng.\nAs soon as he reached the room at the back, he espied Chih Neng all\nalone inside washing the tea cups; and Ch'in Chung forthwith seized her\nin his arms and implanted kisses on her cheek. Chih Neng got in a\ndreadful state, and stamping her feet, cried, \"What are you up to?\" and\nshe was just on the point of shouting out, when Ch'in Chung rejoined:\n\"My dear girl! I'm nearly dead from impatience, and if you don't again\nto-day accept my advances, I shall this very moment die on this spot.\"\n\n\"What you're bent upon,\" added Chih Neng, \"can't be effected; not unless\nyou wait until I've left this den and parted company from these people,\nwhen it will be safe enough.\"\n\n\"This is of course easy enough!\" remonstrated Ch'in Chung; \"but the\ndistant water cannot extinguish the close fire!\"\n\nAs he spoke, with one puff, he put out the light, plunging the whole\nroom in pitch darkness; and seizing Chih Neng, he pushed her on to the\nstove-couch and started a violent love affair. Chih Neng could not,\nthough she strained every nerve, escape his importunities; nor could she\nvery well shout, so that she felt compelled to humour him; but while he\nwas in the midst of his ecstatic joy, they perceived a person walk in,\nwho pressed both of them down, without uttering even so much as a sound,\nand plunged them both in such a fright that their very souls flew away\nand their spirits wandered from their bodies; and it was after the third\nparty had burst out laughing with a spurting sound that they eventually\nbecame aware that it was Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc; when, springing to his feet\nimpetuously, Ch'in Chung exclaimed full of resentment, \"What's this that\nyou're up to!\"\n\n\"If you get your monkey up,\" retorted Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"why, then let you and I\nstart bawling out;\" which so abashed Chih Neng that she availed herself\nof the gloomy light to make her escape; while Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had dragged Ch'in\nChung out of the room and asked, \"Now then, do you still want to play\nthe bully!\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" pleaded Ch'in Chung smilingly, \"whatever you do don't\nshout out and let every one know; and all you want, I'll agree to.\"\n\n\"We needn't argue just now,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc observed with a grin; \"wait a while,\nand when all have gone to sleep, we can minutely settle accounts\ntogether.\"\n\nSoon it was time to ease their clothes, and go to bed; and lady Feng\noccupied the inner room; Ch'in Chung and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc the outer; while the\nwhole ground was covered with matrons of the household, who had spread\ntheir bedding, and sat watching. As lady Feng entertained fears that the\njade of Spiritual Perception might be lost, she waited until Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc fell\nasleep, when having directed a servant to bring it to her, she placed it\nunder the side of her own pillow.\n\nWhat accounts Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc settled with Ch'in Chung cannot be ascertained; and\nas in the absence of any positive proof what is known is based upon\nsurmises, we shall not venture to place it on record.\n\nNothing worth noticing occurred the whole night; but the next day, as\nsoon as the morning dawned, dowager lady Chia and madame Wang promptly\ndespatched servants to come and see how Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was getting on; and to\ntell him likewise to put on two pieces of extra clothing, and that if\nthere was nothing to be done it would be better for him to go back.\n\nBut was it likely that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc would be willing to go back? Besides Ch'in\nChung, in his inordinate passion for Chih Neng, instigated Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc to\nentreat lady Feng to remain another day. Lady Feng pondered in her own\nmind that, although the most important matters connected with the\nfuneral ceremonies had been settled satisfactorily, there were still a\nfew minor details, for which no provision had been made, so that could\nshe avail herself of this excuse to remain another day would she not win\nfrom Chia Chen a greater degree of approbation, in the second place,\nwould she not be able further to bring Ch'ing Hs\u00c3\u00bc's business to an\nissue, and, in the third place, to humour Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's wish? In view of\nthese three advantages, which would accrue, \"All that I had to do, I\nhave done,\" she readily signified to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"and if you be bent upon\nrunning about in here, you'll unavoidably place me in still greater\ntrouble; so that we must for certain start homewards to-morrow.\"\n\n\"My dear cousin, my own dear cousin,\" urgently entreated Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, when he\nheard these words, \"let's stay only this one day, and to-morrow we can\ngo back without fail.\"\n\nThey actually spent another night there, and lady Feng availed herself\nof their stay to give directions that the case which had been entrusted\nto her the previous day by the old nun should be secretly communicated\nto Lai Wang Erh. Lai Wang's mind grasped the import of all that was said\nto him, and, having entered the city with all despatch, he went in\nsearch of the gentleman, who acted as secretary (in Mr. Y\u00c3\u00bcn's office),\npretending that he had been directed by Mr. Chia Lien to come and ask\nhim to write a letter and to send it that very night to the Ch'ang An\nmagistrate. The distance amounted to no more than one hundred li, so\nthat in the space of two days everything was brought to a satisfactory\nsettlement. The general, whose name was Y\u00c3\u00bcn Kuang, had been for a long\ntime under obligations to the Chia family, so that he naturally could\nnot refuse his co-operation in such small trifles. When he had handed\nhis reply, Wang Erh started on his way back; where we shall leave him\nand return to lady Feng.\n\nHaving spent another day, she on the morrow took leave of the old nun,\nwhom she advised to come to the mansion after the expiry of three days\nto fetch a reply.\n\nCh'in Chung and Chih Neng could not, by any means, brook the separation,\nand they secretly agreed to a clandestine assignation; but to these\ndetails we need not allude with any minuteness; sufficient to say that\nthey had no alternative but to bear the anguish and to part.\n\nLady Feng crossed over again to the temple of the Iron Fence and\nascertained how things were progressing. But as Pao Chu was obstinate in\nher refusal to return home, Chia Chen found himself under the necessity\nof selecting a few servants to act as her companions. But the reader\nmust listen to what is said in the next chapter by way of explanation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n  Chia Yuan-ch'un is, on account of her talents, selected to enter the\n      Feng Ts'ao Palace.\n  Ch'in Ching-ch'ing departs, in the prime of life, by the yellow spring\n      road.\n\n\nBut we must now return to the two lads, Ch'in Chung and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. After\nthey had passed, along with lady Feng from the Temple of the Iron Fence,\nwhither she had gone to see how things were getting on, they entered the\ncity in their carriages. On their arrival at home, they paid their\nobeisance to dowager lady Chia, madame Wang and the other members of the\nfamily, whence they returned to their own quarters, where nothing worth\nmentioning transpired during the night.\n\nOn the next day, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc perceiving that the repairs to the outer\nschoolroom had been completed, settled with Ch'in Chung that they should\nhave evening classes. But as it happened that Ch'in Chung, who was\nnaturally of an extremely delicate physique, caught somewhat of a chill\nin the country and clandestinely indulged, besides, in an intimacy with\nChih Neng, which unavoidably made him fail to take good care of himself,\nhe was, shortly after his return, troubled with a cough and a feverish\ncold, with nausea for drink and food, and fell into such an extremely\npoor state of health that he simply kept indoors and nursed himself, and\nwas not in a fit condition to go to school. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's spirits were\nreadily damped, but as there was likewise no remedy he had no other\ncourse than to wait until his complete recovery, before he could make\nany arrangements.\n\nLady Feng had meanwhile received a reply from Y\u00c3\u00bcn Kuang, in which he\ninformed her that everything had been satisfactorily settled, and the\nold nun apprised the Chang family that the major had actually suppressed\nhis indignation, hushed his complaints, and taken back the presents of\nthe previous engagement. But who would have ever anticipated that a\nfather and mother, whose hearts were set upon position and their\nambition upon wealth, could have brought up a daughter so conscious of\npropriety and so full of feeling as to seize the first opportunity,\nafter she had heard that she had been withdrawn from her former\nintended, and been promised to the Li family, to stealthily devise a way\nto commit suicide, by means of a handkerchief. The son of the Major,\nupon learning that Chin Ko had strangled herself, there and then jumped\ninto the river and drowned himself, as he too was a being full of love.\nThe Chang and Li families were, sad to relate, very much cut up, and, in\nvery truth, two lives and money had been sacrificed all to no use.\n\nLady Feng, however, during this while, quietly enjoyed the three\nthousand taels, and madame Wang did not have even so much as the\nfaintest idea of the whole matter. But ever since this occasion, lady\nFeng's audacity acquired more and more strength; and the actions of this\nkind, which she, in after days, performed, defy enumeration.\n\nOne day, the very day on which Chia Cheng's birthday fell, while the\nmembers of the two households of Ning and Jung were assembled together\noffering their congratulations, and unusual bustle and stir prevailed, a\ngatekeeper came in, at quite an unexpected moment, to announce that Mr.\nHsia, Metropolitan Head Eunuch of the six palaces, had come with the\nspecial purpose of presenting an edict from his Majesty; a bit of news\nwhich plunged Chia She, Chia Cheng and the whole company into great\nconsternation, as they could not make out what was up. Speedily\ninterrupting the theatrical performance, they had the banquet cleared,\nand the altar laid out with incense, and opening the centre gate they\nfell on their knees to receive the edict.\n\nSoon they caught sight of the head eunuch, Hsia Ping-chung, advancing on\nhorseback, and besides himself, a considerable retinue of eunuchs. The\neunuch Hsia did not, in fact, carry any mandate or present any decree;\nbut straightway advancing as far as the main hall, he dismounted, and,\nwith a face beaming with smiles, he walked into the Hall and took his\nstand on the southern side.\n\n\"I have had the honour,\" he said, \"of receiving a special order to at\nonce summon Chia Cheng to present himself at Court and be admitted in\nHis Majesty's presence in the Lin Ching Hall.\"\n\nWhen he had delivered this message, he did not so much as take any tea,\nbut forthwith mounted his horse and took his leave.\n\nChia Cheng and the others could not even conceive what omen this summons\nimplied, but he had no alternative but to change his clothes with all\nhaste and to present himself at Court, while dowager lady Chia and the\ninmates of the whole household were, in their hearts, a prey to such\nperplexity and uncertainty that they incessantly despatched messengers\non flying steeds to go and bring the news.\n\nAfter the expiry of four hours, they suddenly perceived Lai Ta and three\nor four other butlers run in, quite out of breath, through the\nceremonial gate and report the glad tidings. \"We have received,\" they\nadded, \"our master's commands, to hurriedly request her venerable\nladyship to take madame Wang and the other ladies into the Palace, to\nreturn thanks for His Majesty's bounty;\" and other words to the same\npurport.\n\nDowager lady Chia was, at this time, standing, with agitated heart,\nunder the verandah of the Large Hall waiting for tidings, whilst the two\nladies, mesdames Hsing and Wang, Mrs. Yu, Li Wan, lady Feng, Ying Ch'un\nand her sisters, even up to Mrs. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh and the rest, were congregated in\none place ascertaining what was the news. Old lady Chia likewise called\nLai Ta in and minutely questioned him as to what had happened. \"Your\nservants,\" replied Lai Ta, \"simply stood waiting outside the Lin Chuang\ngate, so that we were in total ignorance of what was going on inside,\nwhen presently the Eunuch Hsia came out and imparted to us the glad\ntidings; telling us that the eldest of the young ladies in our household\nhad been raised, by His Majesty, to be an overseer in the Feng Ts'ao\nPalace, and that he had, in addition, conferred upon her the rank of\nworthy and virtuous secondary consort. By and by, Mr. Chia Cheng came\nout and also told us the same thing. Master is now gone back again to\nthe Eastern Palace, whither he requests your venerable ladyship to go at\nonce and offer thanks for the Imperial favour.\"\n\nWhen old lady Chia and the other members of the family heard these\ntidings they were at length reassured in their minds, and so elated were\nthey all in one moment that joy was visible in their very faces. Without\nloss of time, they commenced to don the gala dresses suitable to their\nrank; which done, old lady Chia led the way for the two ladies, mesdames\nHsing and Wang, as well as for Mrs. Yu; and their official chairs, four\nof them in all, entered the palace like a trail of fish; while Chia She\nand Chia Chen, who had likewise changed their clothes for their court\ndress, took Chia Se and Chia Jung along and proceeded in attendance upon\ndowager lady Chia.\n\nIndeed, of the two households of Ning and Jung, there was not one,\nwhether high or low, woman or man, who was not in a high state of\nexultation, with the exception of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, who behaved just as if the\nnews had not reached his ears; and can you, reader, guess why? The fact\nis that Chih Neng, of the Water Moon Convent, had recently entered the\ncity in a surreptitious manner in search of Ch'in Chung; but, contrary\nto expectation, her visit came to be known by Ch'in Yeh, who drove Chih\nNeng away and laid hold of Ch'in Chung and gave him a flogging. But this\noutburst of temper of his brought about a relapse of his old complaint,\nwith the result that in three or five days, he, sad to say, succumbed.\nCh'in Chung had himself ever been in a delicate state of health and had\nbesides received a caning before he had got over his sickness, so that\nwhen he now saw his aged father pass away from the consequences of a fit\nof anger, he felt, at this stage, so full of penitence and distress that\nthe symptoms of his illness were again considerably aggravated. Hence it\nwas that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was downcast and unhappy at heart, and that nothing\ncould, in spite of the promotion of Yuan Ch'un by imperial favour,\ndispel the depression of his spirits.\n\nDowager lady Chia and the rest in due course offered thanks and returned\nhome, the relatives and friends came to present their congratulations,\ngreat stir and excitement prevailed during these few days in the two\nmansions of Ning and Jung, and every one was in high glee; but he alone\nlooked upon everything as if it were nothing; taking not the least\ninterest in anything; and as this reason led the whole family to sneer\nat him, the result was that he got more and more doltish.\n\nLuckily, however, Chia Lien and Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc were on their way back, and had\ndespatched messengers, in advance, to announce the news that they would\nbe able to reach home the following day, so that when Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc heard the\ntidings, he was at length somewhat cheered. And when he came to\ninstitute minute inquiries, he eventually found out: \"that Chia Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un\nwas also coming to the capital to have an audience with His Majesty,\nthat it was entirely because Wang Tzu-t'eng had repeatedly laid before\nthe Throne memorials recommending him that he was coming on this\noccasion to wait in the metropolis for a vacancy which he could fill up;\nthat as he was a kinsman of Chia Lien's, acknowledging the same\nancestors as he did, and he stood, on the other hand, with Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, in\nthe relationship of tutor and pupil, he was in consequence following the\nsame road and coming as their companion; that Lin Ju-hai had already\nbeen buried in the ancestral vault, and that every requirement had been\nattended to with propriety; that Chia Lien, on this voyage to the\ncapital, would, had he progressed by the ordinary stages, have been over\na month before he could reach home, but that when he came to hear the\ngood news about Yuan Ch'un, he pressed on day and night to enter the\ncapital; and that the whole journey had been throughout, in every\nrespect, both pleasant and propitious.\"\n\nBut Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc merely ascertained whether Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc was all right, and did not\neven so much as trouble his mind with the rest of what he heard; and he\nremained on the tiptoe of expectation, till noon of the morrow; when, in\npoint of fact, it was announced that Mr. Lien, together with Miss Lin,\nhad made their entrance into the mansion. When they came face to face,\ngrief and joy vied with each other; and they could not help having a\ngood cry for a while; after which followed again expressions of sympathy\nand congratulations; while Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc pondered within himself that Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc\nhad become still more surpassingly handsome.\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc had also brought along with her a good number of books, and she\npromptly gave orders that the sleeping rooms should be swept, and that\nthe various nicknacks should be put in their proper places. She further\nproduced a certain quantity of paper, pencils and other such things, and\ndistributed them among Pao Ch'ai, Ying Ch'un, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc and the rest; and\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc also brought out, with extreme care, the string of Ling-ling\nscented beads, which had been given to him by the Prince of Pei Ching,\nand handed them, in his turn, to Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc as a present.\n\n\"What foul man has taken hold of them?\" exclaimed Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc. \"I don't want\nany such things;\" and as she forthwith dashed them down, and would not\naccept them, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was under the necessity of taking them back. But for\nthe time being we will not allude to them, but devote our attention to\nChia Lien.\n\nHaving, after his arrival home, paid his salutations to all the inmates,\nhe retired to his own quarters at the very moment that lady Feng had\nmultifarious duties to attend to, and had not even a minute to spare;\nbut, considering that Chia Lien had returned from a distant journey, she\ncould not do otherwise than put by what she had to do, and to greet him\nand wait on him.\n\n\"Imperial uncle,\" she said, in a jocose manner, when she realised that\nthere was no outsider present in the room, \"I congratulate you! What\nfatigue and hardship you, Imperial uncle, have had to bear throughout\nthe whole journey, your humble servant heard yesterday, when the courier\nsent ahead came and announced that Your Highness would this day reach\nthis mansion. I have merely got ready a glass of mean wine for you to\nwipe down the dust with, but I wonder, whether Your Highness will deign\nto bestow upon it the lustre of your countenance, and accept it.\"\n\nChia Lien smiled. \"How dare I presume to such an honour,\" he added by\nway of rejoinder; \"I'm unworthy of such attention! Many thanks, many\nthanks.\"\n\nP'ing Erh and the whole company of waiting-maids simultaneously paid\ntheir obeisance to him, and this ceremony concluded, they presented tea.\nChia Lien thereupon made inquiries about the various matters, which had\ntranspired in their home after his departure, and went on to thank lady\nFeng for all the trouble she had taken in the management of them.\n\n\"How could I control all these manifold matters,\" remarked lady Feng;\n\"my experience is so shallow, my speech so dull and my mind so simple,\nthat if any one showed me a club, I would mistake it for a pin. Besides,\nI'm so tender-hearted that were any one to utter a couple of glib\nremarks, I couldn't help feeling my heart give way to compassion and\nsympathy. I've had, in addition, no experience in any weighty questions;\nmy pluck is likewise so very small that when madame Wang has felt in the\nleast displeased, I have not been able to close my eyes and sleep.\nUrgently did I more than once resign the charge, but her ladyship\nwouldn't again agree to it; maintaining, on the contrary, that my object\nwas to be at ease, and that I was not willing to reap experience.\nLeaving aside that she doesn't know that I take things so much to heart,\nthat I can scoop the perspiration in handfuls, that I daren't utter one\nword more than is proper, nor venture to recklessly take one step more\nthan I ought to, you know very well which of the women servants, in\ncharge of the menage in our household, is easy to manage! If ever I make\nthe slightest mistake, they laugh at me and poke fun at me; and if I\nincline a little one way, they show their displeasure by innuendoes;\nthey sit by and look on, they use every means to do harm, they stir up\ntrouble, they stand by on safe ground and look on and don't give a\nhelping hand to lift any one they have thrown over, and they are, one\nand all of them, old hands in such tricks. I'm moreover young in years\nand not able to keep people in check, so that they naturally don't show\nany regard for me! What is still more ridiculous is that after the death\nof Jung Erh's wife in that mansion, brother Chen, time and again, begged\nmadame Wang, on his very knees, to do him the favour to ask me to lend\nhim a hand for several days. I repeatedly signified my refusal, but her\nladyship gave her consent in order to oblige him, so that I had no help\nbut to carry out her wish; putting, as is my wont, everything\ntopsy-turvey, and making matters worse than they were; with the result\nthat brother Chen up to this day bears me a grudge and regrets having\nasked for my assistance. When you see him to-morrow, do what you can to\nexcuse me by him. 'Young as she is,' tell him, 'and without experience\nof the world, who ever could have instigated Mr. Chia Cheng to make such\na mistake as to choose her.'\"\n\nWhile they were still chatting, they heard people talking in the outer\napartments, and lady Feng speedily inquired who it was. P'ing Erh\nentered the room to reply. \"Lady Hs\u00c3\u00bceh,\" she said, \"has sent sister\nHsiang Ling over to ask me something; but I've already given her my\nanswer and sent her back.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" interposed Chia Lien with a smile. \"A short while ago I went\nto look up Mrs. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh and came face to face with a young girl, whose\nfeatures were supremely perfect, and as I suspected that, in our\nhousehold, there was no such person, I asked in the course of\nconversation, Mrs. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh about her, and found out eventually that this\nwas the young waiting-maid they had purchased on their way to the\ncapital, Hsiang Ling by name, and that she had after all become an\ninmate of the household of that big fool Hs\u00c3\u00bceh. Since she's had her hair\ndressed as a married woman she does look so much more pre-eminently\nbeautiful! But that big fool Hs\u00c3\u00bceh has really brought contamination upon\nher.\"\n\n\"Ai!\" exclaimed lady Feng, \"here you are back from a trip to Suchow and\nHang Chow, where you should have seen something of the world! and have\nyou still an eye as envious and a heart so covetous? Well, if you wish\nto bestow your love on her, there's no difficulty worth speaking of.\nI'll take P'ing Erh over and exchange her for her; what do you say to\nthat? that old brother Hs\u00c3\u00bceh is also one of those men, who, while eating\nwhat there is in the bowl, keeps an eye on what there is in the pan! For\nthe last year or so, as he couldn't get Hsiang Ling to be his, he made\never so many distressing appeals to Mrs. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh; and Mrs. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh while\nesteeming Hsiang Ling's looks, though fine, as after all a small matter,\n(thought) her deportment and conduct so far unlike those of other girls,\nso gentle and so demure that almost the very daughters of masters and\nmistresses couldn't attain her standard, that she therefore went to the\ntrouble of spreading a banquet, and of inviting guests, and in open\ncourt, and in the legitimate course, she gave her to him for a secondary\nwife. But half a month had scarcely elapsed before he looked upon her\nalso as a good-for-nothing person as he did upon a large number of them!\nI can't however help feeling pity for her in my heart.\"\n\nScarcely had she time to conclude what she had to say when a youth, on\nduty at the second gate, transmitted the announcement that Mr. Chia\nCheng was in the Library waiting for Mr. Secundus. At these words, Chia\nLien speedily adjusted his clothes, and left the apartment; and during\nhis absence, lady Feng inquired of P'ing Erh what Mrs. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh wanted a\nfew minutes back, that she sent Hsiang Ling round in such a hurry.\n\n\"What Hsiang Ling ever came?\" replied P'ing Erh. \"I simply made use of\nher name to tell a lie for the occasion. Tell me, my lady, (what's come\nto) Wang Erh's wife? why she's got so bad that there's even no common\nsense left in her!\" Saying this she again drew near lady Feng's side,\nand in a soft tone of voice, she continued: \"That interest of yours, my\nlady, she doesn't send later, nor does she send it sooner; but she must\nsend it round the very moment when master Secundus is at home! But as\nluck would have it, I was in the hall, so that I came across her;\notherwise, she would have walked in and told your ladyship, and Mr.\nSecundus would naturally have come to know about it! And our master\nwould, with that frame of mind of his, have fished it out and spent it,\nhad the money even been at the bottom of a pan full of oil! and were he\nto have heard that my lady had private means, would he not have been\nstill more reckless in spending? Hence it was that, losing no time in\ntaking the money over, I had to tell her a few words which, who would\nhave thought, happened to be overheard by your ladyship; that's why, in\nthe presence of master Secundus, I simply explained that Hsiang Ling had\ncome!\"\n\nThese words evoked a smile from lady Feng. \"Mrs. Hsueh, I thought to\nmyself,\" she observed, \"knows very well that your Mr. Secundus has come,\nand yet, regardless of propriety, she, instead (of keeping her at home),\nsends some one over from her inner rooms! and it was you after all, you\nvixen, playing these pranks!\"\n\nAs she uttered this remark, Chia Lien walked in, and lady Feng issued\norders to serve the wine and the eatables, and husband and wife took\ntheir seats opposite to each other; but notwithstanding that lady Feng\nwas very partial to drink, she nevertheless did not have the courage to\nindulge her weakness, but merely partook of some to keep him company.\nChia Lien's nurse, dame Chao, entered the room, and Chia Lien and lady\nFeng promptly pressed her to have a glass of wine, and bade her sit on\nthe stove-couch, but dame Chao was obstinate in her refusal. P'ing Erh\nand the other waiting-maids had at an early hour placed a square stool\nnext to the edge of the couch, where was likewise a small footstool, and\non this footstool dame Chao took a seat, whereupon Chia Lien chose two\ndishes of delicacies from the table, which he handed her to place on the\nsquare stool for her own use.\n\n\"Dame Chao,\" lady Feng remarked, \"couldn't very well bite through that,\nfor mind it might make her teeth drop! This morning,\" she therefore\nasked of P'ing Erh, \"I suggested that that shoulder of pork stewed with\nham was so tender as to be quite the thing to be given to dame Chao to\neat; and how is it you haven't taken it over to her? But go at once and\ntell them to warm it and bring it in! Dame Chao,\" she went on, \"just you\ntaste this Hui Ch'\u00c3\u00bcan wine brought by your foster-son.\"\n\n\"I'll drink it,\" replied dame Chao, \"but you, my lady, must also have a\ncup: what's there to fear? the one thing to guard against is any excess,\nthat's all! But I've now come over, not for any wine or eatables; on the\ncontrary, there's a serious matter, which I would ask your ladyship to\nimpress on your mind, and to show me some regard, for this master of\nours is only good to utter fine words, but when the time (to act) does\ncome, he forgets all about us! As I have had the good fortune to nurse\nhim in his infancy and to bring him up to this age, 'I too have grown\nold in years,' I said to him, 'and all that belong to me are those two\nsons, and do look upon them with some particular favour!' With any one\nelse I shouldn't have ventured to open my mouth, but him I anyway\nentreated time and again on several occasions. His assent was of course\nwell and good, but up to this very moment he still withholds his help.\nNow besides from the heavens has dropped such a mighty piece of good\nluck; and in what place will there be no need of servants? that's why I\ncome to tell you, my lady, as is but right, for were I to depend upon\nour master, I fear I shall even die of starvation.\"\n\nLady Feng laughed. \"You'd better,\" she suggested, \"put those two elder\nfoster brothers of his both under my charge! But you've nursed that\nfoster-son from his babyhood, and don't you yet know that disposition of\nhis, how that he takes his skin and flesh and sticks it, (not on the\nbody of a relative), but, on the contrary, on that of an outsider and\nstranger? (to Chia Lien.) Which of those foster brothers whom you have\nnow discarded, isn't clearly better than others? and were you to have\nshown them some favour and consideration, who would have ventured to\nhave said 'don't?' Instead of that, you confer benefits upon thorough\nstrangers, and all to no purpose whatever! But these words of mine are\nalso incorrect, eh? for those whom we regard as strangers you,\ncontrariwise, will treat just as if they were relatives!\"\n\nAt these words every one present in the room burst out laughing; even\nnurse Chao could not repress herself; and as she invoked Buddha,--\"In\nvery truth,\" she exclaimed, \"in this room has sprung up a kind-hearted\nperson! as regards relatives and strangers, such foolish distinctions\naren't drawn by our master; and it's simply because he's full of pity\nand is tenderhearted that he can't put off any one who gives vent to a\nfew words of entreaty, and nothing else!\"\n\n\"That's quite it!\" rejoined lady Feng smiling sarcastically, \"to those\nwhom he looks upon as relatives, he's kindhearted, but with me and his\nmother he's as hard as steel.\"\n\n\"What you say, my lady, is very considerate,\" remarked nurse Chao, \"and\nI'm really so full of delight that I'll have another glass of good wine!\nand, if from this time forward, your ladyship will act as you think\nbest, I'll have then nothing to be sorry for!\"\n\nChia Lien did not at this juncture feel quite at his ease, but he could\ndo no more than feign a smile. \"You people,\" he said, \"should leave off\ntalking nonsense, and bring the eatables at once and let us have our\nmeal, as I have still to go on the other side and see Mr. Chia Chen, to\nconsult with him about business.\"\n\n\"To be sure you have,\" ventured lady Feng, \"and you shouldn't neglect\nyour legitimate affairs; but what did Mr. Chia Chen tell you when he\nsent for you just a while back?\"\n\n\"It was about the visit (of Yuan Ch'un) to her parents,\" Chia Lien\nexplained.\n\n\"Has after all permission for the visit been granted?\" lady Feng\ninquired with alacrity.\n\n\"Though not quite granted,\" Chia Lien replied joyously, \"it's\nnevertheless more or less an accomplished fact.\"\n\n\"This is indeed evidence of the great bounty of the present Emperor!\"\nlady Feng observed smirkingly; \"one doesn't hear in books, or see in\nplays, written from time to time, any mention of such an instance, even\nso far back as the days of old!\"\n\nDame Chao took up again the thread of the conversation. \"Indeed it's\nso!\" she interposed; \"But I'm in very truth quite stupid from old age,\nfor I've heard every one, high and low, clamouring during these few\ndays, something or other about 'Hsing Ch'in' or no 'Hsing Ch'in,' but I\ndidn't really pay any heed to it; and now again, here's something more\nabout this 'Hsing Ch'in,' but what's it all about, I wonder?\"\n\n\"The Emperor at present on the Throne,\" explained Chia Lien, \"takes into\nconsideration the feelings of his people. In the whole world, there is\n(in his opinion), no more essential thing than filial piety; maintaining\nthat the feelings of father, mother, son and daughter are\nindiscriminately subject to one principle, without any distinction\nbetween honorable and mean. The present Emperor himself day and night\nwaits upon their majesties his Father and the Empress Dowager, and yet\ncannot, in the least degree, carry out to the full his ideal of filial\npiety. The secondary consorts, meritorious persons and other inmates of\nthe Palace, he remembered, had entered within its precincts many years\nback, casting aside fathers and mothers, so how could they not help\nthinking of them? Besides, the fathers and mothers, who remain at home\nmust long for their daughters, of whom they cannot get even so much as a\nglimpse, and if, through this solicitude, they were to contract any\nillness, the harmony of heaven would also be seriously impaired, so for\nthis reason, he memorialised the Emperor, his father, and the Empress\nDowager that every month, on the recurrence of the second and sixth\ndays, permission should be accorded to the relatives of the imperial\nconsorts to enter the palace and make application to see their\ndaughters. The Emperor, his father, and Empress Dowager were, forthwith,\nmuch delighted by this representation, and eulogised, in high terms, the\npiety and generosity of the present Emperor, his regard for the will of\nheaven and his research into the nature of things. Both their sacred\nMajesties consequently also issued a decree to the effect: that the\nentrance of the relatives of the imperial consorts into the Palace could\nnot but interfere with the dignity of the state, and the rules of\nconventional rites, but that as the mothers and daughters could not\ngratify the wishes of their hearts, Their Majesties would, after all,\nshow a high proof of expedient grace, and issue a special command that:\n'exclusive of the generous bounty, by virtue of which the worthy\nrelations of the imperial consorts could enter the palace on the second\nand sixth days, any family, having extensive accommodation and separate\ncourts suitable for the cantonment of the imperial body-guard, could,\nwithout any detriment, make application to the Inner Palace, for the\nentrance of the imperial chair into the private residences, to the end\nthat the personal feelings of relations might be gratified, and that\nthey should collectively enjoy the bliss of a family reunion.' After the\nissue of this decree, who did not leap from grateful joy! The father of\nthe honourable secondary consort Chou has now already initiated works,\nin his residence, for the repairs to the separate courts necessary for\nthe visiting party. Wu T'ien-yu too, the father of Wu, the distinguished\nconsort, has likewise gone outside the city walls in search of a\nsuitable plot of ground; and don't these amount to well-nigh\naccomplished facts?\"\n\n\"O-mi-to-fu!\" exclaimed dame Chao. \"Is it really so? but from what you\nsay, our family will also be making preparations for the reception of\nthe eldest young lady!\"\n\n\"That goes without saying,\" added Chia Lien, \"otherwise, for what\npurpose could we be in such a stir just now?\"\n\n\"It's of course so!\" interposed lady Feng smiling, \"and I shall now have\nan opportunity of seeing something great of the world. My misfortune is\nthat I'm young by several years; for had I been born twenty or thirty\nyears sooner, all these old people wouldn't really be now treating me\ncontemptuously for not having seen the world! To begin with, the Emperor\nTai Tsu, in years gone by, imitated the old policy of Shun, and went on\na tour, giving rise to more stir than any book could have ever produced;\nbut I happen to be devoid of that good fortune which could have enabled\nme to come in time.\"\n\n\"Ai ya, ya!\" ejaculated dame Chao, \"such a thing is rarely met with in a\nthousand years! I was old enough at that time to remember the\noccurrence! Our Chia family was then at Ku Su, Yangchow and all along\nthat line, superintending the construction of ocean vessels, and the\nrepairs to the seaboard. This was the only time in which preparations\nwere made for the reception of the Emperor, and money was lavished in\nquantities as great as the billowing waters of the sea!\"\n\nThis subject once introduced, lady Feng took up the thread of the\nconversation with vehemence. \"Our Wang family,\" she said, \"did also make\npreparations on one occasion. At that time my grandfather was in sole\ncharge of all matters connected with tribute from various states, as\nwell as with general lev\u00c3\u00a9es, so that whenever any foreigners arrived,\nthey all came to our house to be entertained, while the whole of the\ngoods, brought by foreign vessels from the two Kuang provinces, from\nFukien, Yunnan and Chekiang, were the property of our family.\"\n\n\"Who isn't aware of these facts?\" ventured dame Chao; \"there is up to\nthis day a saying that, 'in the eastern sea, there was a white jade bed\nrequired, and the dragon prince came to request Mr. Wang of Chin Ling\n(to give it to him)!' This saying relates to your family, my lady, and\nremains even now in vogue. The Chen family of Chiang Nan has recently\nheld, oh such a fine old standing! it alone has entertained the Emperor\non four occasions! Had we not seen these things with our own eyes, were\nwe to tell no matter whom, they wouldn't surely ever believe them! Not\nto speak of the money, which was as plentiful as mud, all things,\nwhether they were to be found in the world or not, were they not heaped\nup like hills, and collected like the waters of the sea? But with the\nfour characters representing sin and pity they didn't however trouble\ntheir minds.\"\n\n\"I've often heard,\" continued lady Feng, \"my eldest uncle say that\nthings were in such a state, and how couldn't I believe? but what\nsurprises me is how it ever happened that this family attained such\nopulence and honour!\"\n\n\"I'll tell your ladyship and all in one sentence,\" replied nurse Chao.\n\"Why they simply took the Emperor's money and spent it for the Emperor's\nperson, that's all! for what family has such a lot of money as to\nindulge in this useless extravagance?\"\n\nWhile they were engaged in this conversation, a servant came a second\ntime, at the instance of madame Wang, to see whether lady Feng had\nfinished her meal or not; and lady Feng forthwith concluding that there\nmust be something waiting for her to attend to, hurriedly rushed through\nher repast. She had just rinsed her mouth and was about to start when\nthe youths, on duty at the second gate, also reported that the two\ngentlemen, Mr. Chia Jung and Mr. Chia Se, belonging to the Eastern\nmansion, had arrived.\n\nChia Lien had, at length, rinsed his mouth; but while P'ing Erh\npresented a basin for him to wash his hands, he perceived the two young\nmen walk in, and readily inquired of them what they had to say.\n\nLady Feng was, on account (of their arrival), likewise compelled to\nstay, and she heard Chia Jung take the lead and observe: \"My father has\nsent me to tell you, uncle, that the gentlemen, have already decided\nthat the whole extent of ground, starting from the East side, borrowing\n(for the occasion) the flower garden of the Eastern mansion, straight up\nto the North West, had been measured and found to amount in all to three\nand a half li; that it will be suitable for the erection of extra\naccommodation for the visiting party; that they have already\ncommissioned an architect to draw a plan, which will be ready by\nto-morrow; that as you, uncle, have just returned home, and must\nunavoidably feel fatigued, you need not go over to our house, but that\nif you have anything to say you should please come tomorrow morning, as\nearly as you can, and consult verbally with him.\"\n\n\"Thank uncle warmly,\" Chia Lien rejoined smilingly, \"for the trouble he\nhas taken in thinking of me; I shall, in that case, comply with his\nwishes and not go over. This plan is certainly the proper one, for while\ntrouble will thus be saved, the erection of the quarters will likewise\nbe an easy matter; for had a distinct plot to be selected and to be\npurchased, it would involve far greater difficulties. What's more,\nthings wouldn't, after all, be what they properly should be. When you\nget back, tell your father that this decision is the right one, and that\nshould the gentlemen have any further wish to introduce any change in\ntheir proposals, it will rest entirely with my uncle to prevent them, as\nit's on no account advisable to go and cast one's choice on some other\nplot; that to-morrow as soon as it's daylight, I'll come and pay my\nrespects to uncle, when we can enter into further details in our\ndeliberations!\"\n\nChia Jung hastily signified his assent by several yes's, and Chia Se\nalso came forward to deliver his message. \"The mission to Ku Su,\" he\nexplained, \"to find tutors, to purchase servant girls, and to obtain\nmusical instruments, and theatrical properties and the like, my uncle\nhas confided to me; and as I'm to take along with me the two sons of a\ncouple of majordomos, and two companions of the family, besides, Tan\nP'ing-jen and Pei Ku-hsiu, he has, for this reason, enjoined me to come\nand see you, uncle.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Chia Lien scrutinised Chia Se. \"What!\" he asked, \"are\nyou able to undertake these commissions? These matters are, it's true,\nof no great moment; but there's something more hidden in them!\"\n\nChia Se smiled. \"The best thing I can do,\" he remarked, \"will be to\nexecute them in my novice sort of way, that's all.\"\n\nChia Jung was standing next to lady Feng, out of the light of the lamp,\nand stealthily pulled the lapel of her dress. Lady Feng understood the\nhint, and putting on a smiling expression, \"You are too full of fears!\"\nshe interposed. \"Is it likely that our uncle Chen doesn't, after all,\nknow better than we do what men to employ, that you again give way to\napprehensions that he isn't up to the mark! but who are those who are,\nin every respect, up to the mark? These young fellows have grown up\nalready to this age, and if they haven't eaten any pork, they have\nnevertheless seen a pig run. If Mr. Chen has deputed him to go, he is\nsimply meant to sit under the general's standard; and do you imagine,\nforsooth, that he has, in real earnest, told him to go and bargain about\nthe purchase money, and to interview the brokers himself? My own idea is\nthat (the choice) is a very good one.\"\n\n\"Of course it is!\" observed Chia Lien; \"but it isn't that I entertain\nany wish to be factious; my only object is to devise some plan or other\nfor him. Whence will,\" he therefore went on to ask, \"the money required\nfor this purpose come from?\"\n\n\"A little while ago the deliberations reached this point,\" rejoined Chia\nSe; \"and Mr. Lai suggested that there was no necessity at all to take\nany funds from the capital, as the Chen family, in Chiang Nan, had still\nin their possession Tls. 50,000 of our money. That he would to-morrow\nwrite a letter of advice and a draft for us to take along, and that we\nshould, first of all, obtain cash to the amount of Tls. 30,000, and let\nthe balance of Tls. 20,000 remain over, for the purchase of painted\nlanterns, and coloured candles, as well as for the outlay for every kind\nof portieres, banners, curtains and streamers.\"\n\nChia Lien nodded his head. \"This plan is first-rate!\" he added.\n\n\"Since that be so,\" observed lady Feng, as she addressed herself to Chia\nSe, \"I've two able and reliable men; and if you would take them with\nyou, to attend to these matters, won't it be to your convenience?\"\n\nChia Se forced a smile. \"I was just on the point,\" he rejoined, \"of\nasking you, aunt, for the loan of two men, so that this suggestion is a\nstrange coincidence.\"\n\nAs he went on to ascertain what were their names, lady Feng inquired\nwhat they were of nurse Chao. But nurse Chao had, by this time, become\nquite dazed from listening to the conversation, and P'ing Erh had to\ngive her a push, as she smiled, before she returned to consciousness.\n\"The one,\" she hastened to reply, \"is called Chao T'ien-liang and the\nother Chao T'ien-tung.\"\n\n\"Whatever you do,\" suggested lady Feng, \"don't forget them; but now I'm\noff to look after my duties.\"\n\nWith these words, she left the room, and Chia Jung promptly followed her\nout, and with gentle voice he said to her: \"Of whatever you want, aunt,\nissue orders that a list be drawn up, and I'll give it to my brother to\ntake with him, and he'll carry out your commissions according to the\nlist.\"\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense!\" replied lady Feng laughing; \"I've found no place,\nas yet, where I could put away all my own things; and do the stealthy\npractices of you people take my fancy?\"\n\nAs she uttered these words she straightway went her way.\n\nChia Se, at this time, likewise, asked Chia Lien: \"If you want anything\n(in the way of curtains), I can conveniently have them woven for you,\nalong with the rest, and bring them as a present to you.\"\n\n\"Don't be in such high glee!\" Chia Lien urged with a grin, \"you've but\nrecently been learning how to do business, and have you come first and\nforemost to excel in tricks of this kind? If I require anything, I'll of\ncourse write and tell you, but we needn't talk about it.\"\n\nHaving finished speaking, he dismissed the two young men; and, in quick\nsuccession, servants came to make their business reports, not limited to\nthree and five companies, but as Chia Lien felt exhausted, he forthwith\nsent word to those on duty at the second gate not to allow any one at\nall to communicate any reports, and that the whole crowd should wait\ntill the next day, when he would give his mind to what had to be done.\n\nLady Feng did not come to retire to rest till the third watch; but\nnothing need be said about the whole night.\n\nThe next morning, at an early hour, Chia Lien got up and called on Chia\nShe and Chia Cheng; after which, he came over to the Ning Kuo mansion;\nwhen, in company with the old major-domos and other servants, as well as\nwith several old family friends and companions, he inspected the grounds\nof the two mansions, and drew plans of the palatial buildings (for the\naccommodation of the Imperial consort and her escort) on her visit to\nher parents; deliberating at the same time, on the subject of the works\nand workmen.\n\nFrom this day the masons and workmen of every trade were collected to\nthe full number; and the articles of gold, silver, copper, and pewter,\nas well as the earth, timber, tiles, and bricks, were brought over, and\ncarried in, in incessant supplies. In the first place, orders were\nissued to the workmen to demolish the wall and towers of the garden of\nConcentrated Fragrance, and extend a passage to connect in a straight\nline with the large court in the East of the Jung mansion; for the whole\nextent of servants' quarters on the Eastern side of the Jung mansion had\npreviously been pulled down.\n\nThe two residences of Ning and Jung were, in these days, it is true,\ndivided by a small street, which served as a boundary line, and there\nwas no communication between them, but this narrow passage was also\nprivate property, and not in any way a government street, so that they\ncould easily be connected, and as in the garden of Concentrated\nFragrance, there was already a stream of running water, which had been\nintroduced through the corner of the Northern wall, there was no further\nneed now of going to the trouble of bringing in another. Although the\nrockeries and trees were not sufficient, the place where Chia She lived,\nwas an old garden of the Jung mansion, so that the bamboos, trees, and\nrockeries in that compound, as well as the arbours, railings and other\nsuch things could all be very well removed to the front; and by these\nmeans, these two grounds, situated as they were besides so very near to\neach other, could, by being thrown into one, conduce to the saving of\nconsiderable capital and labour; for, in spite of some deficiency, what\nhad to be supplied did not amount to much. And it devolved entirely upon\na certain old Hu, a man of note, styled Shan Tzu-yeh, to deliberate upon\none thing after another, and to initiate its construction.\n\nChia Cheng was not up to these ordinary matters, so that it fell to Chia\nShe, Chia Chen, Chia Lien, Lai Ta, Lai Sheng, Lin Chih-hsiao, Wu\nHsin-teng, Chan Kuang, Ch'eng Jih-hsing and several others to allot the\nsites, to set things in order, (and to look after) the heaping up of\nrockeries, the digging of ponds, the construction of two-storied\nbuildings, the erection of halls, the plantation of bamboos and the\ncultivation of flowers, everything connected with the improvement of the\nscenery devolving, on the other hand, upon Shan Tzu-yeh to make\nprovision for, and after leaving Court, he would devote such leisure\nmoments as he had to merely going everywhere to give a look at the most\nimportant spots, and to consult with Chia She and the others; after\nwhich he troubled his mind no more with anything. And as Chia She did\nnothing else than stay at home and lie off, whenever any matter turned\nup, trifling though it may have been as a grain of mustard seed or a\nbean, Chia Chen and his associates had either to go and report it in\nperson or to write a memorandum of it. Or if he had anything to say, he\nsent for Chia Lien, Lai Ta and others to come and receive his\ninstructions. Chia Jung had the sole direction of the manufacture of the\narticles in gold and silver; and as for Chia Se, he had already set out\non his journey to Ku Su. Chia Chen, Lai Ta and the rest had also to call\nout the roll with the names of the workmen, to superintend the works and\nother duties relative thereto, which could not be recorded by one pen\nalone; sufficient to say that a great bustle and stir prevailed, but to\nthis subject we shall not refer for a time, but allude to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc.\n\nAs of late there were in the household concerns of this magnitude to\nattend to, Chia Cheng did not come to examine him in his lessons, so\nthat he was, of course, in high spirits, but, as unfortunately Ch'in\nChung's complaint became, day by day, more serious, he was at the same\ntime really so very distressed at heart on his account, that enjoyment\nwas for him out of the question.\n\nOn this day, he got up as soon as it was dawn, and having just combed\nhis hair and washed his face and hands, he was bent upon going to ask\ndowager lady Chia to allow him to pay a visit to Ch'in Chung, when he\nsuddenly espied Ming Yen peep round the curtain-wall at the second gate,\nand then withdraw his head. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc promptly walked out and inquired what\nhe was up to.\n\n\"Mr. Ch'in Chung,\" observed Ming Yen, \"is not well at all.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc at these words was quite taken aback. \"It was only yesterday,\" he\nhastily added, \"that I saw him, and he was still bright and cheery; and\nhow is it that he's anything but well now?\"\n\n\"I myself can't explain,\" replied Ming Yen; \"but just a few minutes ago\nan old man belonging to his family came over with the express purpose of\ngiving me the tidings.\"\n\nUpon hearing this news, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc there and then turned round and told\ndowager lady Chia; and the old lady issued directions to depute some\ntrustworthy persons to accompany him. \"Let him go,\" (she said), \"and\nsatisfy his feelings towards his fellow-scholar; but as soon as he has\ndone, he must come back; and don't let him tarry too long.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc with hurried step left the room and came and changed his clothes.\nBut as on his arrival outside, the carriage had not as yet been got\nready, he fell into such a state of excitement, that he went round and\nround all over the hall in quite an erratic manner. In a short while,\nafter pressure had been brought to bear, the carriage arrived, and\nspeedily mounting the vehicle, he drove up to the door of Ch'in Chung's\nhouse, followed by Li Kuei, Ming Yen and the other servants. Everything\nwas quiet. Not a soul was about. Like a hive of bees they flocked into\nthe house, to the astonishment of two distant aunts, and of several male\ncousins of Ch'in Chung, all of whom had no time to effect their retreat.\n\nCh'in Chung had, by this time, had two or three fainting fits, and had\nalready long ago been changed his mat. As soon as Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc realised the\nsituation, he felt unable to repress himself from bursting forth aloud.\nLi Kuei promptly reasoned with him. \"You shouldn't go on in this way,\"\nhe urged, \"you shouldn't. It's because Mr. Ch'in is so weak that lying\nflat on the stove-couch naturally made his bones feel uncomfortable; and\nthat's why he has temporarily been removed down here to ease him a\nlittle. But if you, sir, go on in this way, will you not, instead of\ndoing him any good, aggravate his illness?\"\n\nAt these words, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc accordingly restrained himself, and held his\ntongue; and drawing near, he gazed at Ch'in Chung's face, which was as\nwhite as wax, while with closed eyes, he gasped for breath, rolling\nabout on his pillow.\n\n\"Brother Ching,\" speedily exclaimed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc is here!\" But though\nhe shouted out two or three consecutive times, Ch'in Chung did not heed\nhim.\n\n\"Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc has come!\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc went on again to cry. But Ch'in Chung's spirit\nhad already departed from his body, leaving behind only a faint breath\nof superfluous air in his lungs.\n\nHe had just caught sight of a number of recording devils, holding a\nwarrant and carrying chains, coming to seize him, but Ch'in Chung's soul\nwould on no account go along with them; and remembering how that there\nwas in his home no one to assume the direction of domestic affairs, and\nfeeling concerned that Chih Neng had as yet no home, he consequently\nused hundreds of arguments in his entreaties to the recording devils;\nbut alas! these devils would, none of them, show him any favour. On the\ncontrary, they heaped invectives upon Ch'in Chung.\n\n\"You're fortunate enough to be a man of letters,\" they insinuated, \"and\ndon't you know the common saying that: 'if the Prince of Hell call upon\nyou to die at the third watch, who can presume to retain you, a human\nbeing, up to the fifth watch?' In our abode, in the unseen, high as well\nas low, have all alike a face made of iron, and heed not selfish\nmotives; unlike the mortal world, where favouritism and partiality\nprevail. There exist therefore many difficulties in the way (to our\nyielding to your wishes).\"\n\nWhile this fuss was going on, Ch'in Chung's spirit suddenly grasped the\nfour words, \"Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc has come,\" and without loss of time, it went on\nagain to make further urgent appeals. \"Gentlemen, spiritual deputies,\"\nit exclaimed; \"show me a little mercy and allow me to return to make\njust one remark to an intimate friend of mine, and I'll be back again.\"\n\n\"What intimate friend is this again?\" the devils observed with one\nvoice.\n\n\"I'm not deceiving you, gentlemen,\" rejoined Ch'in Chung; \"it's the\ngrandson of the duke of Jung Kuo, whose infant name is Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc.\"\n\nThe Decider of life was, at first, upon hearing these words, so seized\nwith dismay that he vehemently abused the devils sent on the errand.\n\n\"I told you,\" he shouted, \"to let him go back for a turn; but you would\nby no means comply with my words! and now do you wait until he has\nsummoned a man of glorious fortune and prosperous standing to at last\ndesist?\"\n\nWhen the company of devils perceived the manner of the Decider of life,\nthey were all likewise so seized with consternation that they bustled\nwith hand and feet; while with hearts also full of resentment: \"You,\nsir,\" they replied, \"were at one time such a terror, formidable as\nlightning; and are you not forsooth able to listen with equanimity to\nthe two sounds of 'Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc?' our humble idea is that mortal as he is, and\nimmortal as we are, it wouldn't be to our credit if we feared him!\"\n\nBut whether Ch'in Chung, after all, died or survived, the next chapter\nwill explain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n  In the Ta Kuan Garden, (Broad Vista,) the merits of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc are put to\n      the test, by his being told to write devices for scrolls and\n      tablets.\n  Yuan Ch'un returns to the Jung Kuo mansion, on a visit to her parents,\n      and offers her congratulations to them on the feast of lanterns,\n      on the fifteenth of the first moon.\n\n\nCh'in Chung, to resume our story, departed this life, and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc went on\nso unceasingly in his bitter lamentations, that Li Kuei and the other\nservants had, for ever so long, an arduous task in trying to comfort him\nbefore he desisted; but on his return home he was still exceedingly\ndisconsolate.\n\nDowager lady Chia afforded monetary assistance to the amount of several\ntens of taels; and exclusive of this, she had sacrificial presents\nlikewise got ready. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc went and paid a visit of condolence to the\nfamily, and after seven days the funeral and burial took place, but\nthere are no particulars about them which could be put on record.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, however, continued to mourn (his friend) from day to day, and\nwas incessant in his remembrance of him, but there was likewise no help\nfor it. Neither is it known after how many days he got over his grief.\n\nOn this day, Chia Chen and the others came to tell Chia Cheng that the\nworks in the garden had all been reported as completed, and that Mr.\nChia She had already inspected them. \"It only remains,\" (they said),\n\"for you, sir, to see them; and should there possibly be anything which\nis not proper, steps will be at once taken to effect the alterations, so\nthat the tablets and scrolls may conveniently be written.\"\n\nAfter Chia Cheng had listened to these words, he pondered for a while.\n\"These tablets and scrolls,\" he remarked, \"present however a difficult\ntask. According to the rites, we should, in order to obviate any\nshortcoming, request the imperial consort to deign and compose them; but\nif the honourable consort does not gaze upon the scenery with her own\neyes, it will also be difficult for her to conceive its nature and\nindite upon it! And were we to wait until the arrival of her highness,\nto request her to honour the grounds with a visit, before she composes\nthe inscriptions, such a wide landscape, with so many pavilions and\narbours, will, without one character in the way of a motto, albeit it\nmay abound with flowers, willows, rockeries, and streams, nevertheless\nin no way be able to show off its points of beauty to advantage.\"\n\nThe whole party of family companions, who stood by, smiled. \"Your views,\nremarkable sir,\" they ventured, \"are excellent; but we have now a\nproposal to make. Tablets and scrolls for every locality cannot, on any\naccount, be dispensed with, but they could not likewise, by any means,\nbe determined upon for good! Were now, for the time being, two, three or\nfour characters fixed upon, harmonising with the scenery, to carry out,\nfor form's sake, the idea, and were they provisionally utilised as\nmottoes for the lanterns, tablets and scrolls, and hung up, pending the\narrival of her highness, and her visit through the grounds, when she\ncould be requested to decide upon the devices, would not two exigencies\nbe met with satisfactorily?\"\n\n\"Your views are perfectly correct,\" observed Chia Cheng, after he had\nheard their suggestion; \"and we should go to-day and have a look at the\nplace so as then to set to work to write the inscriptions; which, if\nsuitable, can readily be used; and, if unsuitable, Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un can then be\nsent for, and asked to compose fresh ones.\"\n\nThe whole company smiled. \"If you, sir, were to compose them to-day,\"\nthey ventured, \"they are sure to be excellent; and what need will there\nbe again to wait for Y\u00c3\u00bc-ts'un!\"\n\n\"You people are not aware,\" Chia Cheng added with a smiling countenance,\n\"that I've been, even in my young days, very mediocre in the composition\nof stanzas on flowers, birds, rockeries and streams; and that now that\nI'm well up in years and have moreover the fatigue and trouble of my\nofficial duties, I've become in literary compositions like these, which\nrequire a light heart and gladsome mood, still more inapt. Were I even\nto succeed in composing any, they will unavoidably be so doltish and\nforced that they would contrariwise be instrumental in making the\nflowers, trees, garden and pavilions, through their demerits, lose in\nbeauty, and present instead no pleasing feature.\"\n\n\"This wouldn't anyhow matter,\" remonstrated all the family companions,\n\"for after perusing them we can all decide upon them together, each one\nof us recommending those he thinks best; which if excellent can be kept,\nand if faulty can be discarded; and there's nothing unfeasible about\nthis!\"\n\n\"This proposal is most apposite,\" rejoined Chia Cheng. \"What's more, the\nweather is, I rejoice, fine to-day; so let's all go in a company and\nhave a look.\"\n\nSaying this, he stood up and went forward, at the head of the whole\nparty; while Chia Chen betook himself in advance into the garden to let\nevery one know of their coming. As luck would have it, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc--for he\nhad been these last few days thinking of Ch'in Chung and so ceaselessly\nsad and wounded at heart, that dowager lady Chia had frequently directed\nthe servants to take him into the new garden to play--made his entrance\njust at this very time, and suddenly became aware of the arrival of Chia\nChen, who said to him with a smile, \"Don't you yet run away as fast as\nyou can? Mr. Chia Cheng will be coming in a while.\"\n\nAt these words, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc led off his nurse and the youths, and rushed at\nonce out of the garden, like a streak of smoke; but as he turned a\ncorner, he came face to face with Chia Cheng, who was advancing towards\nthat direction, at the head of all the visitors; and as he had no time\nto get out of the way, the only course open to him was to stand on one\nside.\n\nChia Cheng had, of late, heard the tutor extol him by saying that he\ndisplayed special ability in rhyming antithetical lines, and that\nalthough he did not like to read his books, he nevertheless possessed\nsome depraved talents, and hence it was that he was induced at this\nmoment to promptly bid him follow him into the garden, with the intent\nof putting him to the test.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc could not make out what his object was, but he was compelled to\nfollow. As soon as they reached the garden gate, and he caught sight of\nChia Chen, standing on one side, along with several managers: \"See that\nthe garden gate is closed for a time,\" Chia Cheng exclaimed, \"for we'll\nfirst see the outside and then go in.\"\n\nChia Chen directed a servant to close the gate, and Chia Cheng first\nlooked straight ahead of him towards the gate and espied on the same\nside as the main entrance a suite of five apartments. Above, the\ncylindrical tiles resembled the backs of mud eels. The doors, railings,\nwindows, and frames were all finely carved with designs of the new\nfashion, and were painted neither in vermilion nor in white colours. The\nwhole extent of the walls was of polished bricks of uniform colour;\nwhile below, the white marble on the terrace and steps was engraved with\nwestern foreign designs; and when he came to look to the right and to\nthe left, everything was white as snow. At the foot of the white-washed\nwalls, tiger-skin pebbles were, without regard to pattern, promiscuously\ninserted in the earth in such a way as of their own selves to form\nstreaks. Nothing fell in with the custom of gaudiness and display so\nmuch in vogue, so that he naturally felt full of delight; and, when he\nforthwith asked that the gate should be thrown open, all that met their\neyes was a long stretch of verdant hills, which shut in the view in\nfront of them.\n\n\"What a fine hill, what a pretty hill!\" exclaimed all the companions\nwith one voice.\n\n\"Were it not for this one hill,\" Chia Cheng explained, \"whatever scenery\nis contained in it would clearly strike the eye, as soon as one entered\ninto the garden, and what pleasure would that have been?\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" rejoined all of them. \"But without large hills and ravines\nin one's breast (liberal capacities), how could one attain such\nimagination!\"\n\nAfter the conclusion of this remark, they cast a glance ahead of them,\nand perceived white rugged rocks looking, either like goblins, or\nresembling savage beasts, lying either crossways, or in horizontal or\nupright positions; on the surface of which grew moss and lichen with\nmottled hues, or parasitic plants, which screened off the light; while,\nslightly visible, wound, among the rocks, a narrow pathway like the\nintestines of a sheep.\n\n\"If we were now to go and stroll along by this narrow path,\" Chia Cheng\nsuggested, \"and to come out from over there on our return, we shall have\nbeen able to see the whole grounds.\"\n\nHaving finished speaking, he asked Chia Chen to lead the way; and he\nhimself, leaning on Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, walked into the gorge with leisurely step.\nRaising his head, he suddenly beheld on the hill a block of stone, as\nwhite as the surface of a looking-glass, in a site which was, in very\ndeed, suitable to be left for an inscription, as it was bound to meet\nthe eye.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" Chia Cheng observed, as he turned his head round and\nsmiled, \"please look at this spot. What name will it be fit to give it?\"\n\nWhen the company heard his remark, some maintained that the two words\n\"Heaped verdure\" should be written; and others upheld that the device\nshould be \"Embroidered Hill.\" Others again suggested: \"Vying with the\nHsiang Lu;\" and others recommended \"the small Chung Nan.\" And various\nkinds of names were proposed, which did not fall short of several tens.\n\nAll the visitors had been, it must be explained, aware at an early\nperiod of the fact that Chia Cheng meant to put Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's ability to the\ntest, and for this reason they merely proposed a few combinations in\ncommon use. But of this intention, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc himself was likewise\ncognizant.\n\nAfter listening to the suggestions, Chia Cheng forthwith turned his head\nround and bade Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc think of some motto.\n\n\"I've often heard,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc replied, \"that writers of old opine that it's\nbetter to quote an old saying than to compose a new one; and that an old\nengraving excels in every respect an engraving of the present day.\nWhat's more, this place doesn't constitute the main hill or the chief\nfeature of the scenery, and is really no site where any inscription\nshould be put, as it no more than constitutes the first step in the\ninspection of the landscape. Won't it be well to employ the exact text\nof an old writer consisting of 'a tortuous path leading to a secluded\n(nook).' This line of past days would, if inscribed, be, in fact,\nliberal to boot.\"\n\nAfter listening to the proposed line, they all sang its praise.\n\"First-rate! excellent!\" they cried, \"the natural talents of your second\nson, dear friend, are lofty; his mental capacity is astute; he is unlike\nourselves, who have read books but are simple fools.\"\n\n\"You shouldn't,\" urged Chia Cheng smilingly, \"heap upon him excessive\npraise; he's young in years, and merely knows one thing which he turns\nto the use of ten purposes; you should laugh at him, that's all; but we\ncan by and by choose some device.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he entered the cave, where he perceived beautiful trees\nwith thick foliage, quaint flowers in lustrous bloom, while a line of\nlimpid stream emanated out of a deep recess among the flowers and trees,\nand oozed down through the crevice of the rock. Progressing several\nsteps further in, they gradually faced the northern side, where a\nstretch of level ground extended far and wide, on each side of which\nsoared lofty buildings, intruding themselves into the skies, whose\ncarved rafters and engraved balustrades nestled entirely among the\ndepressions of the hills and the tops of the trees. They lowered their\neyes and looked, and beheld a pure stream flowing like jade, stone steps\ntraversing the clouds, a balustrade of white marble encircling the pond\nin its embrace, and a stone bridge with three archways, the animals upon\nwhich had faces disgorging water from their mouths. A pavilion stood on\nthe bridge, and in this pavilion Chia Chen and the whole party went and\nsat.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he inquired, \"what shall we write about this?\"\n\n\"In the record,\" they all replied, \"of the 'Drunken Old Man's Pavilion,'\nwritten in days of old by Ou Yang, appears this line: 'There is a\npavilion pinioned-like,' so let us call this 'the pinioned-like\npavilion,' and finish.\"\n\n\"Pinioned-like,\" observed Chia Cheng smiling, \"is indeed excellent; but\nthis pavilion is constructed over the water, and there should, after\nall, be some allusion to the water in the designation. My humble opinion\nis that of the line in Ou Yang's work, '(the water) drips from between\nthe two peaks,' we should only make use of that single word 'drips.'\"\n\n\"First-rate!\" rejoined one of the visitors, \"capital! but what would\nreally be appropriate are the two characters 'dripping jadelike.'\"\n\nChia Chen pulled at his moustache, as he gave way to reflection; after\nwhich, he asked Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc to also propose one himself.\n\n\"What you, sir, suggested a while back,\" replied Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"will do very\nwell; but if we were now to sift the matter thoroughly, the use of the\nsingle word 'drip' by Ou Yang, in his composition about the Niang\nspring, would appear quite apposite; while the application, also on this\noccasion, to this spring, of the character 'drip' would be found not\nquite suitable. Moreover, seeing that this place is intended as a\nseparate residence (for the imperial consort), on her visit to her\nparents, it is likewise imperative that we should comply with all the\nprinciples of etiquette, so that were words of this kind to be used,\nthey would besides be coarse and inappropriate; and may it please you to\nfix upon something else more recondite and abstruse.\"\n\n\"What do you, gentlemen, think of this argument?\" Chia Cheng remarked\nsneeringly. \"A little while ago, when the whole company devised\nsomething original, you observed that it would be better to quote an old\ndevice; and now that we have quoted an old motto, you again maintain\nthat it's coarse and inappropriate! But you had better give us one of\nyours.\"\n\n\"If two characters like 'dripping jadelike' are to be used,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\nexplained, \"it would be better then to employ the two words 'Penetrating\nFragrance,' which would be unique and excellent, wouldn't they?\"\n\nChia Cheng pulled his moustache, nodded his head and did not utter a\nword; whereupon the whole party hastily pressed forward with one voice\nto eulogize Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's acquirements as extraordinary.\n\n\"The selection of two characters for the tablet is an easy matter,\"\nsuggested Chia Cheng, \"but now go on and compose a pair of antithetical\nphrases with seven words in each.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc cast a glance round the four quarters, when an idea came into his\nhead, and he went on to recite:\n\n  The willows, which enclose the shore, the green borrow from three\n      bamboos;\n  On banks apart, the flowers asunder grow, yet one perfume they give.\n\nUpon hearing these lines, Chia Cheng gave a faint smile, as he nodded\nhis head, whilst the whole party went on again to be effusive in their\npraise. But forthwith they issued from the pavilions, and crossed the\npond, contemplating with close attention each elevation, each stone,\neach flower, or each tree. And as suddenly they raised their heads, they\ncaught sight, in front of them, of a line of white wall, of numbers of\ncolumns, and beautiful cottages, where flourished hundreds and thousands\nof verdant bamboos, which screened off the rays of the sun.\n\n\"What a lovely place!\" they one and all exclaimed.\n\nSpeedily the whole company penetrated inside, perceiving, as soon as\nthey had entered the gate, a zigzag arcade, below the steps of which was\na raised pathway, laid promiscuously with stones, and on the furthest\npart stood a diminutive cottage with three rooms, two with doors leading\ninto them and one without. Everything in the interior, in the shape of\nbeds, teapoys, chairs and tables, were made to harmonise with the space\navailable. Leading out of the inner room of the cottage was a small door\nfrom which, as they egressed, they found a back-court with lofty pear\ntrees in blossom and banana trees, as well as two very small retiring\nback-courts. At the foot of the wall, unexpectedly became visible an\naperture where was a spring, for which a channel had been opened\nscarcely a foot or so wide, to enable it to run inside the wall. Winding\nround the steps, it skirted the buildings until it reached the front\ncourt, where it coiled and curved, flowing out under the bamboos.\n\n\"This spot,\" observed Chia Cheng full of smiles, \"is indeed pleasant!\nand could one, on a moonlight night, sit under the window and study, one\nwould not spend a whole lifetime in vain!\"\n\nAs he said this, he quickly cast a glance at Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, and so terrified\ndid Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc feel that he hastily drooped his head. The whole company lost\nno time in choosing some irrelevant talk to turn the conversation, and\ntwo of the visitors prosecuted their remarks by adding that on the\ntablet, in this spot, four characters should be inscribed.\n\n\"Which four characters?\" Chia Cheng inquired, laughingly.\n\n\"The bequeathed aspect of the river Ch'i!\" suggested one of them.\n\n\"It's commonplace,\" observed Chia Cheng.\n\nAnother person recommended \"the remaining vestiges of the Ch\u00c3\u00bc Garden.\"\n\n\"This too is commonplace!\" replied Chia Cheng.\n\n\"Let brother Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc again propound one!\" interposed Chia Chen, who stood\nby.\n\n\"Before he composes any himself,\" Chia Cheng continued, \"his wont is to\nfirst discuss the pros and cons of those of others; so it's evident that\nhe's an impudent fellow!\"\n\n\"He's most reasonable in his arguments,\" all the visitors protested,\n\"and why should he be called to task?\"\n\n\"Don't humour him so much!\" Chia Cheng expostulated. \"I'll put up for\nto-day,\" he however felt constrained to tell Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"with your haughty\nmanner, and your rubbishy speech, so that after you have, to begin with,\ngiven us your opinion, you may next compose a device. But tell me, are\nthere any that will do among the mottoes suggested just now by all the\ngentlemen?\"\n\n\"They all seem to me unsuitable!\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc did not hesitate to say by way\nof reply to this question.\n\nChia Cheng gave a sardonic smile. \"How all unsuitable?\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"This,\" continued Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"is the first spot which her highness will\nhonour on her way, and there should be inscribed, so that it should be\nappropriate, something commending her sacred majesty. But if a tablet\nwith four characters has to be used, there are likewise devices ready at\nhand, written by poets of old; and what need is there to compose any\nmore?\"\n\n\"Are forsooth the devices 'the river Ch'i and the Chu Garden' not those\nof old authors?\" insinuated Chia Cheng.\n\n\"They are too stiff,\" replied Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. \"Would not the four characters: 'a\nphoenix comes with dignified air,' be better?\"\n\nWith clamorous unanimity the whole party shouted: \"Excellent:\" and Chia\nCheng nodding his head; \"You beast, you beast!\" he ejaculated, \"it may\nwell be said about you that you see through a thin tube and have no more\njudgment than an insect! Compose another stanza,\" he consequently bade\nhim; and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc recited:\n\n  In the precious tripod kettle, tea is brewed, but green is still the\n      smoke!\n  O'er is the game of chess by the still window, but the fingers are yet\n      cold.\n\nChia Cheng shook his head. \"Neither does this seem to me good!\" he said;\nand having concluded this remark he was leading the company out, when\njust as he was about to proceed, he suddenly bethought himself of\nsomething.\n\n\"The several courts and buildings and the teapoys, sideboards, tables\nand chairs,\" he added, \"may be said to be provided for. But there are\nstill all those curtains, screens and portieres, as well as the\nfurniture, nicknacks and curios; and have they too all been matched to\nsuit the requirements of each place?\"\n\n\"Of the things that have to be placed about,\" Chia Chen explained, a\ngood number have, at an early period, been added, and of course when the\ntime comes everything will be suitably arranged. As for the curtains,\nscreens, and portieres, which have to be hung up, I heard yesterday\nbrother Lien say that they are not as yet complete, that when the works\nwere first taken in hand, the plan of each place was drawn, the\nmeasurements accurately calculated and some one despatched to attend to\nthe things, and that he thought that yesterday half of them were bound\nto come in.\n\nChia Cheng, upon hearing this explanation, readily remembered that with\nall these concerns Chia Chen had nothing to do; so that he speedily sent\nsome one to go and call Chia Lien.\n\nHaving arrived in a short while, \"How many sorts of things are there in\nall?\" Chia Cheng inquired of him. \"Of these how many kinds have by this\ntime been got ready? and how many more are short?\"\n\nAt this question, Chia Lien hastily produced, from the flaps of his\nboot, a paper pocket-book, containing a list, which he kept inside the\ntops of his boot. After perusing it and reperusing it, he made suitable\nreply. \"Of the hundred and twenty curtains,\" he proceeded, \"of stiff\nspotted silks, embroidered with dragons in relief, and of the curtains\nlarge and small, of every kind of damask silk, eighty were got\nyesterday, so that there still remain forty of them to come. The two\nportieres were both received yesterday; and besides these, there are the\ntwo hundred red woollen portieres, two hundred portieres of Hsiang Fei\nbamboo; two hundred door-screens of rattan, with gold streaks, and of\nred lacquered bamboo; two hundred portieres of black lacquered rattan;\ntwo hundred door-screens of variegated thread-netting with clusters of\nflowers. Of each of these kinds, half have come in, but the whole lot of\nthem will be complete no later than autumn. Antimacassars, table-cloths,\nflounces for the beds, and cushions for the stools, there are a thousand\ntwo hundred of each, but these likewise are ready and at hand.\"\n\nAs he spoke, they proceeded outwards, but suddenly they perceived a hill\nextending obliquely in such a way as to intercept the passage; and as\nthey wound round the curve of the hill faintly came to view a line of\nyellow mud walls, the whole length of which was covered with paddy\nstalks for the sake of protection, and there were several hundreds of\napricot trees in bloom, which presented the appearance of being fire,\nspurted from the mouth, or russet clouds, rising in the air. Inside this\nenclosure, stood several thatched cottages. Outside grew, on the other\nhand, mulberry trees, elms, mallows, and silkworm oaks, whose tender\nshoots and new twigs, of every hue, were allowed to bend and to\nintertwine in such a way as to form two rows of green fence. Beyond this\nfence and below the white mound, was a well, by the side of which stood\na well-sweep, windlass and such like articles; the ground further down\nbeing divided into parcels, and apportioned into fields, which, with the\nfine vegetables and cabbages in flower, presented, at the first glance,\nthe aspect of being illimitable.\n\n\"This is,\" Chia Cheng observed chuckling, \"the place really imbued with\na certain amount of the right principle; and laid out, though it has\nbeen by human labour, yet when it strikes my eye, it so moves my heart,\nthat it cannot help arousing in me the wish to return to my native place\nand become a farmer. But let us enter and rest a while.\"\n\nAs he concluded these words, they were on the point of walking in, when\nthey unexpectedly discerned a stone, outside the trellis gate, by the\nroadside, which had also been left as a place on which to inscribe a\nmotto.\n\n\"Were a tablet,\" argued the whole company smilingly, \"put up high in a\nspot like this, to be filled up by and by, the rustic aspect of a farm\nwould in that case be completely done away with; and it will be better,\nyea far better to erect this slab on the ground, as it will further make\nmanifest many points of beauty. But unless a motto could be composed of\nthe same excellence as that in Fan Shih-hu's song on farms, it will not\nbe adequate to express its charms!\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" observed Chia Cheng, \"please suggest something.\"\n\n\"A short while back,\" replied the whole company, \"your son, venerable\nbrother, remarked that devising a new motto was not equal to quoting an\nold one, and as sites of this kind have been already exhausted by\nwriters of days of old, wouldn't it be as well that we should\nstraightway call it the 'apricot blossom village?' and this will do\nsplendidly.\"\n\nWhen Chia Cheng heard this remark, he smiled and said, addressing\nhimself to Chia Chen: \"This just reminds me that although this place is\nperfect in every respect, there's still one thing wanting in the shape\nof a wine board; and you had better then have one made to-morrow on the\nvery same pattern as those used outside in villages; and it needn't be\nanything gaudy, but hung above the top of a tree by means of bamboos.\"\n\nChia Chen assented. \"There's no necessity,\" he went on to explain, \"to\nkeep any other birds in here, but only to rear a few geese, ducks, fowls\nand such like; as in that case they will be in perfect keeping with the\nplace.\"\n\n\"A splendid idea!\" Chia Cheng rejoined, along with all the party.\n\n\"'Apricot blossom village' is really first-rate,\" continued Chia Cheng\nas he again addressed himself to the company; \"but the only thing is\nthat it encroaches on the real designation of the village; and it will\nbe as well to wait (until her highness comes), when we can request her\nto give it a name.\"\n\n\"Certainly!\" answered the visitors with one voice; \"but now as far as a\nname goes, for mere form, let us all consider what expressions will be\nsuitable to employ.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc did not however give them time to think; nor did he wait for Chia\nCheng's permission, but suggested there and then: \"In old poetical works\nthere's this passage: 'At the top of the red apricot tree hangs the flag\nof an inn,' and wouldn't it be advisable, on this occasion, to\ntemporarily adopt the four words: 'the sign on the apricot tree is\nvisible'?\"\n\n\"'Is visible' is excellent,\" suggested the whole number of them, \"and\nwhat's more it secretly accords with the meaning implied by 'apricot\nblossom village.'\"\n\n\"Were the two words 'apricot blossom' used for the name of the village,\nthey would be too commonplace and unsuitable;\" added Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc with a\nsardonic grin, \"but there's another passage in the works of a poet of\nthe T'ang era: 'By the wooden gate near the water the corn-flower emits\nits fragrance;' and why not make use of the motto 'corn fragrance\nvillage,' which will be excellent?\"\n\nWhen the company heard his proposal, they, with still greater vigour,\nunanimously combined in crying out \"Capital!\" as they clapped their\nhands.\n\nChia Cheng, with one shout, interrupted their cries, \"You ignorant child\nof wrath!\" he ejaculated; \"how many old writers can you know, and how\nmany stanzas of ancient poetical works can you remember, that you will\nhave the boldness to show off in the presence of all these experienced\ngentlemen? (In allowing you to give vent to) all the nonsense you\nuttered my object was no other than to see whether your brain was clear\nor muddled; and all for fun's sake, that's all; and lo, you've taken\nthings in real earnest!\"\n\nSaying this, he led the company into the interior of the hall with the\nmallows. The windows were pasted with paper, and the bedsteads made of\nwood, and all appearance of finery had been expunged, and Chia Cheng's\nheart was naturally much gratified; but nevertheless, scowling angrily\nat Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"What do you think of this place?\" he asked.\n\nWhen the party heard this question, they all hastened to stealthily give\na nudge to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, with the express purpose of inducing him to say it\nwas nice; but Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc gave no ear to what they all urged. \"It's by far\nbelow the spot,\" he readily replied, \"designated 'a phoenix comes with\ndignified air.'\"\n\n\"You ignorant stupid thing!\" exclaimed Chia Cheng at these words; \"what\nyou simply fancy as exquisite, with that despicable reliance of yours\nupon luxury and display, are two-storied buildings and painted pillars!\nBut how can you know anything about this aspect so pure and unobtrusive,\nand this is all because of that failing of not studying your books!\"\n\n\"Sir,\" hastily answered Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"your injunctions are certainly correct;\nbut men of old have often made allusion to 'natural;' and what is, I\nwonder, the import of these two characters?\"\n\nThe company had perceived what a perverse mind Pao y\u00c3\u00bc possessed, and\nthey one and all were much surprised that he should be so silly beyond\nthe possibility of any change; and when now they heard the question he\nasked, about the two characters representing \"natural,\" they, with one\naccord, speedily remarked, \"Everything else you understand, and how is\nit that on the contrary you don't know what 'natural' implies? The word\n'natural' means effected by heaven itself and not made by human labour.\"\n\n\"Well, just so,\" rejoined Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc; \"but the farm, which is laid out in\nthis locality, is distinctly the handiwork of human labour; in the\ndistance, there are no neighbouring hamlets; near it, adjoin no wastes;\nthough it bears a hill, the hill is destitute of streaks; though it be\nclose to water, this water has no spring; above, there is no pagoda\nnestling in a temple; below, there is no bridge leading to a market; it\nrises abrupt and solitary, and presents no grand sight! The palm would\nseem to be carried by the former spot, which is imbued with the natural\nprinciple, and possesses the charms of nature; for, though bamboos have\nbeen planted in it, and streams introduced, they nevertheless do no\nviolence to the works executed. 'A natural landscape,' says, an ancient\nauthor in four words; and why? Simply because he apprehended that what\nwas not land, would, by forcible ways, be converted into land; and that\nwhat was no hill would, by unnatural means, be raised into a hill. And\ningenious though these works might be in a hundred and one ways, they\ncannot, after all, be in harmony.\"...\n\nBut he had no time to conclude, as Chia Cheng flew into a rage. \"Drive\nhim off,\" he shouted; (but as Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc) was on the point of going out, he\nagain cried out: \"Come back! make up,\" he added, \"another couplet, and\nif it isn't clear, I'll for all this give you a slap on your mouth.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc had no alternative but to recite as follows:\n\n  A spot in which the \"Ko\" fibre to bleach, as the fresh tide doth swell\n      the waters green!\n  A beauteous halo and a fragrant smell the man encompass who the cress\n      did pluck!\n\nChia Cheng, after this recital, nodded his head. \"This is still worse!\"\nhe remarked, but as he reproved him, he led the company outside, and\nwinding past the mound, they penetrated among flowers, and wending their\nsteps by the willows, they touched the rocks and lingered by the stream.\nPassing under the trellis with yellow roses, they went into the shed\nwith white roses; they crossed by the pavilion with peonies, and walked\nthrough the garden, where the white peony grew; and entering the court\nwith the cinnamon roses, they reached the island of bananas. As they\nmeandered and zigzagged, suddenly they heard the rustling sound of the\nwater, as it came out from a stone cave, from the top of which grew\nparasitic plants drooping downwards, while at its bottom floated the\nfallen flowers.\n\n\"What a fine sight!\" they all exclaimed; \"what beautiful scenery!\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" observed Chia Cheng, \"what name do you propose for this\nplace?\"\n\n\"There's no further need for deliberation,\" the company rejoined; \"for\nthis is just the very spot fit for the three words 'Wu Ling Spring.'\"\n\n\"This too is matter-of-fact!\" Chia Cheng objected laughingly, \"and\nlikewise antiquated.\"\n\n\"If that won't do,\" the party smiled, \"well then what about the four\ncharacters implying 'An old cottage of a man of the Ch'in dynasty?'\"\n\n\"This is still more exceedingly plain!\" interposed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. \"'The old\ncottage of a man of the Ch'in dynasty' is meant to imply a retreat from\nrevolution, and how will it suit this place? Wouldn't the four\ncharacters be better denoting 'an isthmus with smart weed, and a stream\nwith flowers'?\"\n\nWhen Chia Cheng heard these words, he exclaimed: \"You're talking still\nmore stuff and nonsense?\" and forthwith entering the grotto, Chia Cheng\nwent on to ask of Chia Chen, \"Are there any boats or not?\"\n\n\"There are to be,\" replied Chia Chen, \"four boats in all from which to\npick the lotus, and one boat for sitting in; but they haven't now as yet\nbeen completed.\"\n\n\"What a pity!\" Chia Cheng answered smilingly, \"that we cannot go in.\"\n\n\"But we could also get into it by the tortuous path up the hill,\" Chia\nChen ventured; and after finishing this remark, he walked ahead to show\nthe way, and the whole party went over, holding on to the creepers, and\nsupporting themselves by the trees, when they saw a still larger\nquantity of fallen leaves on the surface of the water, and the stream\nitself, still more limpid, gently and idly meandering along on its\ncircuitous course. By the bank of the pond were two rows of weeping\nwillows, which, intermingling with peach and apricot trees, screened the\nheavens from view, and kept off the rays of the sun from this spot,\nwhich was in real truth devoid of even a grain of dust.\n\nSuddenly, they espied in the shade of the willows, an arched wooden\nbridge also reveal itself to the eye, with bannisters of vermilion\ncolour. They crossed the bridge, and lo, all the paths lay open before\nthem; but their gaze was readily attracted by a brick cottage spotless\nand cool-looking; whose walls were constructed of polished bricks, of\nuniform colour; (whose roof was laid) with speckless tiles; and whose\nenclosing walls were painted; while the minor slopes, which branched off\nfrom the main hill, all passed along under the walls on to the other\nside.\n\n\"This house, in a site like this, is perfectly destitute of any charm!\"\nadded Chia Cheng.\n\nAnd as they entered the door, abruptly appeared facing them, a large\nboulder studded with holes and soaring high in the skies, which was\nsurrounded on all four sides by rocks of every description, and\ncompletely, in fact, hid from view the rooms situated in the compound.\nBut of flowers or trees, there was not even one about; and all that was\nvisible were a few strange kinds of vegetation; some being of the\ncreeper genus, others parasitic plants, either hanging from the apex of\nthe hill, or inserting themselves into the base of the rocks; drooping\ndown even from the eaves of the house, entwining the pillars, and\nclosing round the stone steps. Or like green bands, they waved and\nflapped; or like gold thread, they coiled and bent, either with seeds\nresembling cinnabar, or with blossoms like golden olea; whose fragrance\nand aroma could not be equalled by those emitted by flowers of ordinary\nspecies.\n\n\"This is pleasant!\" Chia Cheng could not refrain from saying; \"the only\nthing is that I don't know very much about flowers.\"\n\n\"What are here are lianas and ficus pumila!\" some of the company\nobserved.\n\n\"How ever can the liana and the ficus have such unusual scent?\"\nquestioned Chia Cheng.\n\n\"Indeed they aren't!\" interposed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. \"Among all these flowers, there\nare also ficus and liana, but those scented ones are iris, ligularia,\nand 'Wu' flowers; that kind consist, for the most part, of 'Ch'ih'\nflowers and orchids; while this mostly of gold-coloured dolichos. That\nspecies is the hypericum plant, this the 'Y\u00c3\u00bc Lu' creeper. The red ones\nare, of course, the purple rue; the green ones consist for certain, of\nthe green 'Chih' plant; and, to the best of my belief, these various\nplants are mentioned in the 'Li Sao' and 'Wen Hsuan.' These rare plants\nare, some of them called something or other like 'Huo Na' and 'Chiang\nHui;' others again are designated something like 'Lun Tsu' and 'Tz'u\nFeng;' while others there are whose names sound like 'Shih Fan,' 'Shui\nSung' and 'Fu Liu,' which together with other species are to be found in\nthe 'Treatise about the Wu city' by Tso T'ai-chung. There are also those\nwhich go under the appellation of 'Lu T'i,' or something like that;\nwhile there are others that are called something or other like 'Tan\nChiao,' 'Mi Wu' and 'Feng Lien;' reference to which is made in the\n'Treatise on the Shu city.' But so many years have now elapsed, and the\ntimes have so changed (since these treatises were written), that people,\nbeing unable to discriminate (the real names) may consequently have had\nto appropriate in every case such names as suited the external aspect,\nso that they may, it is quite possible, have gradually come to be called\nby wrong designations.\"\n\nBut he had no time to conclude; for Chia Cheng interrupted him. \"Who has\never asked you about it?\" he shouted; which plunged Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc into such a\nfright, that he drew back, and did not venture to utter another word.\n\nChia Cheng perceiving that on both sides alike were covered passages\nresembling outstretched arms, forthwith continued his steps and entered\nthe covered way, when he caught sight, at the upper end, of a\nfive-roomed building, without spot or blemish, with folding blinds\nextending in a connected line, and with corridors on all four sides; (a\nbuilding) which with its windows so green, and its painted walls,\nexcelled, in spotless elegance, the other buildings they had seen\nbefore, to which it presented such a contrast.\n\nChia Cheng heaved a sigh. \"If one were able,\" he observed, \"to boil his\ntea and thrum his lyre in here, there wouldn't even be any need for him\nto burn any more incense. But the execution of this structure is so\nbeyond conception that you must, gentlemen, compose something nice and\noriginal to embellish the tablet with, so as not to render such a place\nof no effect!\"\n\n\"There's nothing so really pat,\" suggested the company smiling; \"as 'the\norchid-smell-laden breeze' and 'the dew-bedecked epidendrum!\"\n\n\"These are indeed the only four characters,\" rejoined Chia Cheng, \"that\ncould be suitably used; but what's to be said as far as the scroll\ngoes?\"\n\n\"I've thought of a couplet,\" interposed one of the party, \"which you'll\nall have to criticise, and put into ship-shape; its burden is this:\n\n \"The musk-like epidendrum smell enshrouds the court, where shines the\n      sun with oblique beams;\n  The iris fragrance is wafted over the isle illumined by the moon's\n      clear rays.\"\n\n\"As far as excellence is concerned, it's excellent,\" observed the whole\nparty, \"but the two words representing 'with oblique beams' are not\nfelicitous.\"\n\nAnd as some one quoted the line from an old poem:\n\n  The angelica fills the court with tears, what time the sun doth slant.\n\n\"Lugubrious, lugubrious!\" expostulated the company with one voice.\n\nAnother person then interposed. \"I also have a couplet, whose merits\nyou, gentlemen, can weigh; it runs as follows:\n\n \"Along the three pathways doth float the Y\u00c3\u00bc Hui scented breeze!\n  The radiant moon in the whole hall shines on the gold orchid!\"\n\nChia Cheng tugged at his moustache and gave way to meditation. He was\njust about also to suggest a stanza, when, upon suddenly raising his\nhead, he espied Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc standing by his side, too timid to give vent to a\nsingle sound.\n\n\"How is it,\" he purposely exclaimed, \"that when you should speak, you\ncontrariwise don't? Is it likely that you expect some one to request you\nto confer upon us the favour of your instruction?\"\n\n\"In this place,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc rejoined at these words, \"there are no such\nthings as orchids, musk, resplendent moon or islands; and were one to\nbegin quoting such specimens of allusions, to scenery, two hundred\ncouplets could be readily given without, even then, having been able to\nexhaust the supply!\"\n\n\"Who presses your head down,\" Chia Cheng urged, \"and uses force that you\nmust come out with all these remarks?\"\n\n\"Well, in that case,\" added Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"there are no fitter words to put on\nthe tablet than the four representing: 'The fragrance pure of the\nligularia and iris.' While the device on the scroll might be:\n\n \"Sung is the nutmeg song, but beauteous still is the sonnet!\n  Near the T'u Mei to sleep, makes e'en a dream with fragrance full!\"\n\n\"This is,\" laughed Chia Cheng sneeringly, \"an imitation of the line:\n\n \"A book when it is made of plaintain leaves, the writing green is also\n      bound to be!\n\n\"So that there's nothing remarkable about it.\"\n\n\"Li T'ai-po, in his work on the Phoenix Terrace,\" protested the whole\nparty, \"copied, in every point, the Huang Hua Lou. But what's essential\nis a faultless imitation. Now were we to begin to criticise minutely the\ncouplet just cited, we would indeed find it to be, as compared with the\nline 'A book when it is made of plantain leaves,' still more elegant and\nof wider application!\"\n\n\"What an idea?\" observed Chia Cheng derisively.\n\nBut as he spoke, the whole party walked out; but they had not gone very\nfar before they caught sight of a majestic summer house, towering high\npeak-like, and of a structure rising loftily with storey upon storey;\nand completely locked in as they were on every side they were as\nbeautiful as the Jade palace. Far and wide, road upon road coiled and\nwound; while the green pines swept the eaves, the jady epidendrum\nencompassed the steps, the animals' faces glistened like gold, and the\ndragons' heads shone resplendent in their variegated hues.\n\n\"This is the Main Hall,\" remarked Chia Cheng; \"the only word against it\nis that there's a little too much finery.\"\n\n\"It should be so,\" rejoined one and all, \"so as to be what it's intended\nto be! The imperial consort has, it is true, an exalted preference for\neconomy and frugality, but her present honourable position requires the\nobservance of such courtesies, so that (finery) is no fault.\"\n\nAs they made these remarks and advanced on their way the while, they\nperceived, just in front of them, an archway project to view,\nconstructed of jadelike stone; at the top of which the coils of large\ndragons and the scales of small dragons were executed in perforated\nstyle.\n\n\"What's the device to be for this spot?\" inquired Chia Cheng.\n\n\"It should be 'fairy land,'\" suggested all of them, \"so as to be\napposite!\"\n\nChia Cheng nodded his head and said nothing. But as soon as Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\ncaught sight of this spot something was suddenly aroused in his heart\nand he began to ponder within himself. \"This place really resembles\nsomething that I've seen somewhere or other.\" But he could not at the\nmoment recall to mind what year, moon, or day this had happened.\n\nChia Cheng bade him again propose a motto; but Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was bent upon\nthinking over the details of the scenery he had seen on a former\noccasion, and gave no thought whatever to this place, so that the whole\ncompany were at a loss what construction to give to his silence, and\ncame simply to the conclusion that, after the bullying he had had to put\nup with for ever so long, his spirits had completely vanished, his\ntalents become exhausted and his speech impoverished; and that if he\nwere harassed and pressed, he might perchance, as the result of anxiety,\ncontract some ailment or other, which would of course not be a suitable\nissue, and they lost no time in combining together to dissuade Chia\nCheng.\n\n\"Never mind,\" they said, \"to-morrow will do to compose some device;\nlet's drop it now.\"\n\nChia Cheng himself was inwardly afraid lest dowager lady Chia should be\nanxious, so that he hastily remarked as he forced a smile. \"You beast,\nthere are, after all, also occasions on which you are no good! but never\nmind! I'll give you one day to do it in, and if by to-morrow you haven't\nbeen able to compose anything, I shall certainly not let you off. This\nis the first and foremost place and you must exercise due care in what\nyou write.\"\n\nSaying this, he sallied out, at the head of the company, and cast\nanother glance at the scenery.\n\nIndeed from the time they had entered the gate up to this stage, they\nhad just gone over five or six tenths of the whole ground, when it\nhappened again that a servant came and reported that some one had\narrived from Mr. Y\u00c3\u00bc-'ts'un's to deliver a message. \"These several places\n(which remain),\" Chia Cheng observed with a smile, \"we have no time to\npass under inspection; but we might as well nevertheless go out at least\nby that way, as we shall be able, to a certain degree, to have a look at\nthe general aspect.\"\n\nWith these words, he showed the way for the family companions until they\nreached a large bridge, with water entering under it, looking like a\ncurtain made of crystal. This bridge, the fact is, was the dam, which\ncommunicated with the river outside, and from which the stream was\nintroduced into the grounds.\n\n\"What's the name of this water-gate?\" Chia Cheng inquired.\n\n\"This is,\" replied Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"the main stream of the Hsin Fang river, and\nis therefore called the Hsin Fang water-gate.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Chia Cheng. \"The two words Hsin Fang must on no\naccount be used!\"\n\nAnd as they speedily advanced on their way, they either came across\nelegant halls, or thatched cottages; walls made of piled-up stone, or\ngates fashioned of twisted plants; either a secluded nunnery or Buddhist\nfane, at the foot of some hill; or some unsullied houses, hidden in a\ngrove, tenanted by rationalistic priestesses; either extensive corridors\nand winding grottoes; or square buildings, and circular pavilions. But\nChia Cheng had not the energy to enter any of these places, for as he\nhad not had any rest for ever so long, his legs felt shaky and his feet\nweak.\n\nSuddenly they also discerned ahead of them a court disclose itself to\nview.\n\n\"When we get there,\" Chia Cheng suggested, \"we must have a little rest.\"\nStraightway as he uttered the remark, he led them in, and winding round\nthe jade-green peach-trees, covered with blossom, they passed through\nthe bamboo fence and flower-laden hedge, which were twisted in such a\nway as to form a circular, cavelike gateway, when unexpectedly appeared\nbefore their eyes an enclosure with whitewashed walls, in which verdant\nwillows drooped in every direction.\n\nChia Cheng entered the gateway in company with the whole party. Along\nthe whole length of both sides extended covered passages, connected with\neach other; while in the court were laid out several rockeries. In one\nquarter were planted a number of banana trees; on the opposite stood a\nplant of begonia from Hsi Fu. Its appearance was like an open umbrella.\nThe gossamer hanging (from its branches) resembled golden threads. The\ncorollas (seemed) to spurt out cinnabar.\n\n\"What a beautiful flower! what a beautiful flower!\" ejaculated the whole\nparty with one voice; \"begonias are verily to be found; but never before\nhave we seen anything the like of this in beauty.\"\n\n\"This is called the maiden begonia and is, in fact, a foreign species,\"\nChia Cheng observed. \"There's a homely tradition that it is because it\nemanates from the maiden kingdom that its flowers are most prolific; but\nthis is likewise erratic talk and devoid of common sense.\"\n\n\"They are, after all,\" rejoined the whole company, \"so unlike others (we\nhave seen), that what's said about the maiden kingdom is, we are\ninclined to believe, possibly a fact.\"\n\n\"I presume,\" interposed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"that some clever bard or poet,\n(perceiving) that this flower was red like cosmetic, delicate as if\npropped up in sickness, and that it closely resembled the nature of a\nyoung lady, gave it, consequently, the name of maiden! People in the\nworld will propagate idle tales, all of which are unavoidably treated as\ngospel!\"\n\n\"We receive (with thanks) your instructions; what excellent\nexplanation!\" they all remarked unanimously, and as they expressed these\nwords, the whole company took their seats on the sofas under the\ncolonnade.\n\n\"Let's think of some original text or other for a motto,\" Chia Cheng\nhaving suggested, one of the companions opined that the two characters:\n\"Banana and stork\" would be felicitous; while another one was of the\nidea that what would be faultless would be: \"Collected splendour and\nwaving elegance!\"\n\n\"'Collected splendour and waving elegance' is excellent,\" Chia Cheng\nobserved addressing himself to the party; and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc himself, while also\nextolling it as beautiful, went on to say: \"There's only one thing\nhowever to be regretted!\"\n\n\"What about regret?\" the company inquired.\n\n\"In this place,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc explained, \"are set out both bananas as well as\nbegonias, with the intent of secretly combining in them the two\nproperties of red and green; and if mention of one of them be made, and\nthe other be omitted, (the device) won't be good enough for selection.\"\n\n\"What would you then suggest?\" Chia Cheng asked.\n\n\"I would submit the four words, 'the red (flowers) are fragrant, the\ngreen (banana leaves) like jade,' which would render complete the\nbeauties of both (the begonias and bananas).\"\n\n\"It isn't good! it isn't good!\" Chia Cheng remonstrated as he shook his\nhead; and while passing this remark, he conducted the party into the\nhouse, where they noticed that the internal arrangements effected\ndiffered from those in other places, as no partitions could, in fact, be\ndiscerned. Indeed, the four sides were all alike covered with boards\ncarved hollow with fretwork, (in designs consisting) either of rolling\nclouds and hundreds of bats; or of the three friends of the cold season\nof the year, (fir, bamboo and almond); of scenery and human beings, or\nof birds or flowers; either of clusters of decoration, or of relics of\nolden times; either of ten thousand characters of happiness or of ten\nthousand characters of longevity. The various kinds of designs had been\nall carved by renowned hands, in variegated colours, inlaid with gold,\nand studded with precious gems; while on shelf upon shelf were either\narranged collections of books, or tripods were laid out; either pens and\ninkslabs were distributed about, or vases with flowers set out, or\nfigured pots were placed about; the designs of the shelves being either\nround or square; or similar to sunflowers or banana leaves; or like\nlinks, half overlapping each other. And in very truth they resembled\nbouquets of flowers or clusters of tapestry, with all their fretwork so\ntransparent. Suddenly (the eye was struck) by variegated gauzes pasted\n(on the wood-work), actually forming small windows; and of a sudden by\nfine thin silks lightly overshadowing (the fretwork) just as if there\nwere, after all, secret doors. The whole walls were in addition traced,\nwith no regard to symmetry, with outlines of the shapes of curios and\nnick-nacks in imitation of lutes, double-edged swords, hanging bottles\nand the like, the whole number of which, though (apparently) suspended\non the walls, were all however on a same level with the surface of the\npartition walls.\n\n\"What fine ingenuity!\" they all exclaimed extollingly; \"what a labour\nthey must have been to carry out!\"\n\nChia Cheng had actually stepped in; but scarcely had they reached the\nsecond stage, before the whole party readily lost sight of the way by\nwhich they had come in. They glanced on the left, and there stood a\ndoor, through which they could go. They cast their eyes on the right,\nand there was a window which suddenly impeded their progress. They went\nforward, but there again they were obstructed by a bookcase. They turned\ntheir heads round, and there too stood windows pasted with transparent\ngauze and available door-ways: but the moment they came face to face\nwith the door, they unexpectedly perceived that a whole company of\npeople had likewise walked in, just in front of them, whose appearance\nresembled their own in every respect. But it was only a mirror. And when\nthey rounded the mirror, they detected a still larger number of doors.\n\n\"Sir,\" Chia Chen remarked with a grin; \"if you'll follow me out through\nthis door, we'll forthwith get into the back-court; and once out of the\nback-court, we shall be, at all events, nearer than we were before.\"\n\nTaking the lead, he conducted Chia Cheng and the whole party round two\ngauze mosquito houses, when they verily espied a door through which they\nmade their exit, into a court, replete with stands of cinnamon roses.\nPassing round the flower-laden hedge, the only thing that spread before\ntheir view was a pure stream impeding their advance. The whole company\nwas lost in admiration. \"Where does this water again issue from?\" they\ncried.\n\nChia Chen pointed to a spot at a distance. \"Starting originally,\" he\nexplained, \"from that water-gate, it runs as far as the mouth of that\ncave, when from among the hills on the north-east side, it is introduced\ninto that village, where again a diverging channel has been opened and\nit is made to flow in a south-westerly direction; the whole volume of\nwater then runs to this spot, where collecting once more in one place,\nit issues, on its outward course, from beneath that wall.\"\n\n\"It's most ingenious!\" they one and all exclaimed, after they had\nlistened to him; but, as they uttered these words, they unawares\nrealised that a lofty hill obstructed any further progress. The whole\nparty felt very hazy about the right road. But \"Come along after me,\"\nChia Chen smilingly urged, as he at once went ahead and showed the way,\nwhereupon the company followed in his steps, and as soon as they turned\nround the foot of the hill, a level place and broad road lay before\nthem; and wide before their faces appeared the main entrance.\n\n\"This is charming! this is delightful!\" the party unanimously exclaimed,\n\"what wits must have been ransacked, and ingenuity attained, so as to\nbring things to this extreme degree of excellence!\"\n\nForthwith the party egressed from the garden, and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's heart\nanxiously longed for the society of the young ladies in the inner\nquarters, but as he did not hear Chia Cheng bid him go, he had no help\nbut to follow him into the library. But suddenly Chia Cheng bethought\nhimself of him. \"What,\" he said, \"you haven't gone yet! the old lady\nwill I fear be anxious on your account; and is it pray that you haven't\nas yet had enough walking?\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc at length withdrew out of the library. On his arrival in the\ncourt, a page, who had been in attendance on Chia Cheng, at once pressed\nforward, and took hold of him fast in his arms. \"You've been lucky\nenough,\" he said, \"to-day to have been in master's good graces! just a\nwhile back when our old mistress despatched servants to come on several\noccasions and ask after you, we replied that master was pleased with\nyou; for had we given any other answer, her ladyship would have sent to\nfetch you to go in, and you wouldn't have had an opportunity of\ndisplaying your talents. Every one admits that the several stanzas you\nrecently composed were superior to those of the whole company put\ntogether; but you must, after the good luck you've had to-day, give us a\ntip!\"\n\n\"I'll give each one of you a tiao,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc rejoined smirkingly.\n\n\"Who of us hasn't seen a tiao?\" they all exclaimed, \"let's have that\npurse of yours, and have done with it!\"\n\nSaying this, one by one advanced and proceeded to unloosen the purse,\nand to unclasp the fan-case; and allowing Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc no time to make any\nremonstrance, they stripped him of every ornament in the way of\nappendage which he carried about on his person. \"Whatever we do let's\nescort him home!\" they shouted, and one after another hustled round him\nand accompanied him as far as dowager lady Chia's door.\n\nHer ladyship was at this moment awaiting his arrival, so that when she\nsaw him walk in, and she found out that (Chia Cheng) had not bullied\nhim, she felt, of course, extremely delighted. But not a long interval\nelapsed before Hsi Jen came to serve the tea; and when she perceived\nthat on his person not one of the ornaments remained, she consequently\nsmiled and inquired: \"Have all the things that you had on you been again\ntaken away by these barefaced rascals?\"\n\nAs soon as Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc heard this remark, she crossed over to him and saw\nat a glance that not one single trinket was, in fact, left. \"Have you\nalso given them,\" she felt constrained to ask, \"the purse that I gave\nyou? Well, by and by, when you again covet anything of mine, I shan't\nlet you have it.\"\n\nAfter uttering these words, she returned into her apartment in high\ndudgeon, and taking the scented bag, which Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had asked her to make\nfor him, and which she had not as yet finished, she picked up a pair of\nscissors, and instantly cut it to pieces.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc noticing that she had lost her temper, came after her with\nhurried step, but the bag had already been cut with the scissors; and as\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc observed how extremely fine and artistic this scented bag was, in\nspite of its unfinished state, he verily deplored that it should have\nbeen rent to pieces for no rhyme or reason. Promptly therefore\nunbuttoning his coat, he produced from inside the lapel the purse, which\nhad been fastened there. \"Look at this!\" he remarked as he handed it to\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc; \"what kind of thing is this! have I given away to any one what\nwas yours?\" Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, upon seeing how much he prized it as to wear it\nwithin his clothes, became alive to the fact that it was done with\nintent, as he feared lest any one should take it away; and as this\nconviction made her sorry that she had been so impetuous as to have cut\nthe scented bag, she lowered her head and uttered not a word.\n\n\"There was really no need for you to have cut it,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc observed; \"but\nas I know that you're loth to give me anything, what do you say to my\nreturning even this purse?\"\n\nWith these words, he threw the purse in her lap and walked off; which\nvexed Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc so much the more that, after giving way to tears, she took\nup the purse in her hands to also destroy it with the scissors, when\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc precipitately turned round and snatched it from her grasp.\n\n\"My dear cousin,\" he smilingly pleaded, \"do spare it!\" and as Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc\ndashed down the scissors and wiped her tears: \"You needn't,\" she urged,\n\"be kind to me at one moment, and unkind at another; if you wish to have\na tiff, why then let's part company!\" But as she spoke, she lost control\nover her temper, and, jumping on her bed, she lay with her face turned\ntowards the inside, and set to work drying her eyes.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc could not refrain from approaching her. \"My dear cousin, my own\ncousin,\" he added, \"I confess my fault!\"\n\n\"Go and find Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc!\" dowager lady Chia thereupon gave a shout from\nwhere she was in the front apartment, and all the attendants explained\nthat he was in Miss Lin's room.\n\n\"All right, that will do! that will do!\" her ladyship rejoined, when she\nheard this reply; \"let the two cousins play together; his father kept\nhim a short while back under check, for ever so long, so let him have\nsome distraction. But the only thing is that you mustn't allow them to\nhave any quarrels.\" To which the servants in a body expressed their\nobedience.\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc, unable to put up with Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's importunity, felt compelled to\nrise. \"Your object seems to be,\" she remarked, \"not to let me have any\nrest. If it is, I'll run away from you.\" Saying which, she there and\nthen was making her way out, when Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc protested with a face full of\nsmiles: \"Wherever you go, I'll follow!\" and as he, at the same time,\ntook the purse and began to fasten it on him, Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc stretched out her\nhand, and snatching it away, \"You say you don't want it,\" she observed,\n\"and now you put it on again! I'm really much ashamed on your account!\"\nAnd these words were still on her lips when with a sound of Ch'ih, she\nburst out laughing.\n\n\"My dear cousin,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc added, \"to-morrow do work another scented bag\nfor me!\"\n\n\"That too will rest upon my good pleasure,\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc rejoined.\n\nAs they conversed, they both left the room together and walked into\nmadame Wang's suite of apartments, where, as luck would have it,\nPao-ch'ai was also seated.\n\nUnusual commotion prevailed, at this time, over at madame Wang's, for\nthe fact is that Chia Se had already come back from Ku Su, where he had\nselected twelve young girls, and settled about an instructor, as well as\nabout the theatrical properties and the other necessaries. And as Mrs.\nHs\u00c3\u00bceh had by this date moved her quarters into a separate place on the\nnortheast side, and taken up her abode in a secluded and quiet house,\n(madame Wang) had had repairs of a distinct character executed in the\nPear Fragrance Court, and then issued directions that the instructor\nshould train the young actresses in this place; and casting her choice\nupon all the women, who had, in days of old, received a training in\nsinging, and who were now old matrons with white hair, she bade them\nhave an eye over them and keep them in order. Which done, she enjoined\nChia Se to assume the chief control of all matters connected with the\ndaily and monthly income and outlay, as well as of the accounts of all\narticles in use of every kind and size.\n\nLin Chih-hsiao also came to report: \"that the twelve young nuns and\nTaoist girls, who had been purchased after proper selection, had all\narrived, and that the twenty newly-made Taoist coats had also been\nreceived. That there was besides a maiden, who though devoted to\nasceticism, kept her chevelure unshaved; that she was originally a\ndenizen of Suchow, of a family whose ancestors were also people of\nletters and official status; that as from her youth up she had been\nstricken with much sickness, (her parents) had purchased a good number\nof substitutes (to enter the convent), but all with no relief to her,\nuntil at last this girl herself entered the gate of abstraction when she\nat once recovered. That hence it was that she grew her hair, while she\ndevoted herself to an ascetic life; that she was this year eighteen\nyears of age, and that the name given to her was Miao Y\u00c3\u00bc; that her\nfather and mother were, at this time, already dead; that she had only by\nher side, two old nurses and a young servant girl to wait upon her; that\nshe was most proficient in literature, and exceedingly well versed in\nthe classics and canons; and that she was likewise very attractive as\nfar as looks went; that having heard that in the city of Ch'ang-an,\nthere were vestiges of Kuan Yin and relics of the canons inscribed on\nleaves, she followed, last year, her teacher (to the capital). She now\nlives,\" he said, \"in the Lao Ni nunnery, outside the western gate; her\nteacher was a great expert in prophetic divination, but she died in the\nwinter of last year, and her dying words were that as it was not\nsuitable for (Miao Y\u00c3\u00bc) to return to her native place, she should await\nhere, as something in the way of a denouement was certain to turn up;\nand this is the reason why she hasn't as yet borne the coffin back to\nher home!\"\n\n\"If such be the case,\" madame Wang readily suggested, \"why shouldn't we\nbring her here?\"\n\n\"If we are to ask her,\" Lin Chih-hsiao's wife replied, \"she'll say that\na marquis' family and a duke's household are sure, in their honourable\nposition, to be overbearing to people; and I had rather not go.\"\n\n\"As she's the daughter of an official family,\" madame Wang continued,\n\"she's bound to be inclined to be somewhat proud; but what harm is there\nto our sending her a written invitation to ask her to come!\"\n\nLin Chih-hsiao's wife assented; and leaving the room, she made the\nsecretary write an invitation and then went to ask Miao Y\u00c3\u00bc. The next day\nservants were despatched, and carriages and sedan chairs were got ready\nto go and bring her over.\n\nWhat subsequently transpired is not as yet known, but, reader, listen to\nthe account given in the following chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n  His Majesty shows magnanimous bounty.\n  The Imperial consort Yuan pays a visit to her parents.\n  The happiness of a family gathering.\n  Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc displays his polished talents.\n\n\nBut let us resume our story. A servant came, at this moment, to report\nthat for the works in course of execution, they were waiting for gauze\nand damask silk to paste on various articles, and that they requested\nlady Feng to go and open the dep\u00c3\u00b4t for them to take the gauze and silk,\nwhile another servant also came to ask lady Feng to open the treasury\nfor them to receive the gold and silver ware. And as Madame Wang, the\nwaiting-maids and the other domestics of the upper rooms had all no\nleisure, Pao-ch'ai suggested: \"Don't let us remain in here and be in the\nway of their doing what there is to be done, and of going where they\nhave to go,\" and saying this, she betook herself, escorted by Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc and\nthe rest, into Ying Ch'un's rooms.\n\nMadame Wang continued day after day in a great state of flurry and\nconfusion, straight up to within the tenth moon, by which time every\narrangement had been completed, and the overseers had all handed in a\nclear statement of their accounts. The curios and writing materials,\nwherever needed, had all already been laid out and everything got ready,\nand the birds (and animals), from the stork, the deer and rabbits to the\nchickens, geese and the like, had all been purchased and handed over to\nbe reared in the various localities in the garden; and over at Chia\nSe's, had also been learnt twenty miscellaneous plays, while a company\nof young nuns and Taoist priestesses had likewise the whole number of\nthem, mastered the intonation of Buddhist classics and incantations.\n\nChia Cheng after this, at length, was slightly composed in mind, and\ncheerful at heart; and having further invited dowager lady Chia and\nother inmates to go into the garden, he deliberated with them on, and\nmade arrangements for, every detail in such a befitting manner that not\nthe least trifle remained for which suitable provision had not been\nmade; and Chia Cheng eventually mustered courage to indite a memorial,\nand on the very day on which the memorial was presented, a decree was\nreceived fixing upon the fifteenth day of the first moon of the ensuing\nyear, the very day of the Shang Yuan festival, for the honourable\nconsorts to visit their homes.\n\nUpon the receipt of this decree, with which the Chia family was\nhonoured, they had still less leisure, both by day as well as by night;\nso much so that they could not even properly observe the new year\nfestivities. But in a twinkle of the eye, the festival of the full moon\nof the first moon drew near; and beginning from the eighth day of the\nfirst moon, eunuchs issued from the palace and inspected beforehand the\nvarious localities, the apartments in which the imperial consort was to\nchange her costume; the place where she would spend her leisure moments;\nthe spot where she would receive the conventionalities; the premises\nwhere the banquets would be spread; the quarters where she would retire\nfor rest.\n\nThere were also eunuchs who came to assume the patrol of the grounds and\nthe direction of the defences; and they brought along with them a good\nmany minor eunuchs, whose duty it was to look after the safety of the\nvarious localities, to screen the place with enclosing curtains, to\ninstruct the inmates and officials of the Chia mansion whither to go out\nand whence to come in from, what side the viands should be brought in\nfrom, where to report matters, and in the observance of every kind of\netiquette; and for outside the mansion, there were, on the other hand,\nofficers from the Board of Works, and a superintendent of the Police, of\nthe \"Five Cities,\" in charge of the sweeping of the streets and roads,\nand the clearing away of loungers. While Chia She and the others\nsuperintended the workmen in such things as the manufacture of flowered\nlanterns and fireworks.\n\nThe fourteenth day arrived and everything was in order; but on this\nnight, one and all whether high or low, did not get a wink of sleep; and\nwhen the fifteenth came, every one, at the fifth watch, beginning from\ndowager lady Chia and those who enjoyed any official status, appeared in\nfull gala dress, according to their respective ranks. In the garden, the\ncurtains were, by this time, flapping like dragons, the portieres flying\nabout like phoenixes with variegated plumage. Gold and silver glistened\nwith splendour. Pearls and precious gems shed out their brilliant\nlustre. The tripod censers burnt the Pai-ho incense. In the vases were\nplaced evergreens. Silence and stillness prevailed, and not a man\nventured so much as to cough.\n\nChia She and the other men were standing outside the door giving on to\nthe street on the west; and old lady Chia and the other ladies were\noutside the main entrance of the Jung mansion at the head of the street,\nwhile at the mouth of the lane were placed screens to rigorously\nobstruct the public gaze. They were unable to bear the fatigue of any\nfurther waiting when, at an unexpected moment, a eunuch arrived on\nhorseback, and Chia Cheng went up to meet him, and ascertained what\ntidings he was the bearer of.\n\n\"It's as yet far too early,\" rejoined the eunuch, \"for at one o'clock\n(her highness) will have her evening repast, and at two she has to\nbetake herself to the Palace of Precious Perception to worship Buddha.\nAt five, she will enter the Palace of Great Splendour to partake of a\nbanquet, and to see the lanterns, after which, she will request His\nMajesty's permission; so that, I'm afraid, it won't be earlier than\nseven before they set out.\"\n\nLady Feng's ear caught what was said. \"If such be the case,\" she\ninterposed, \"may it please your venerable ladyship, and you, my lady, to\nreturn for a while to your apartments, and wait; and if you come when\nit's time you'll be here none too late.\"\n\nDowager lady Chia and the other ladies immediately left for a time and\nsuited their own convenience, and as everything in the garden devolved\nupon lady Feng to supervise, she ordered the butlers to take the eunuchs\nand give them something to eat and drink; and at the same time, she sent\nword that candles should be brought in and that the lanterns in the\nvarious places should be lit.\n\nBut unexpectedly was heard from outside the continuous patter of horses\nrunning, whereupon about ten eunuchs hurried in gasping and out of\nbreath. They clapped their hands, and the several eunuchs (who had come\nbefore), understanding the signal, and knowing that the party had\narrived, stood in their respective positions; while Chia She, at the\nhead of all the men of the clan, remained at the western street door,\nand dowager lady Chia, at the head of the female relatives of the\nfamily, waited outside the principal entrance to do the honours.\n\nFor a long interval, everything was plunged in silence and quiet; when\nsuddenly two eunuchs on horseback were espied advancing with leisurely\nstep. Reaching the western street gate, they dismounted, and, driving\ntheir horses beyond the screens, they forthwith took their stand facing\nthe west. After another long interval, a second couple arrived, and went\nlikewise through the same proceedings. In a short time, drew near about\nten couples, when, at length, were heard the gentle strains of music,\nand couple by couple advanced with banners, dragons, with fans made with\nphoenix feathers, and palace flabella of pheasant plumes; and those\nbesides who carried gold-washed censers burning imperial incense. Next\nin order was brought past a state umbrella of golden yellow, with\ncrooked handle and embroidered with seven phoenixes; after which quickly\nfollowed the crown, robe, girdle and shoes.\n\nThere were likewise eunuchs, who took a part in the procession, holding\nscented handkerchiefs and embroidered towels, cups for rinsing the\nmouth, dusters and other such objects; and company after company went\npast, when, at the rear, approached with stately step eight eunuchs\ncarrying an imperial sedan chair, of golden yellow, with a gold knob and\nembroidered with phoenixes.\n\nOld lady Chia and the other members of the family hastily fell on their\nknees, but a eunuch came over at once to raise her ladyship and the\nrest; and the imperial chair was thereupon carried through the main\nentrance, the ceremonial gate and into a court on the eastern side, at\nthe door of which stood a eunuch, who prostrated himself and invited\n(her highness) to dismount and change her costume.\n\nHaving forthwith carried her inside the gate, the eunuchs dispersed; and\nonly the maids-of-honour and ladies-in-waiting ushered Yuan Ch'un out of\nthe chair, when what mainly attracted her eye in the park was the\nbrilliant lustre of the flowered lamps of every colour, all of which\nwere made of gauze or damask, and were beautiful in texture, and out of\nthe common run; while on the upper side was a flat lantern with the\ninscription in four characters, \"Regarded (by His Majesty's) benevolence\nand permeated by his benefits.\"\n\nYuan Ch'un entered the apartment and effected the necessary changes in\nher toilette; after which, she again egressed, and, mounting her chair,\nshe made her entry into the garden, when she perceived the smoke of\nincense whirling and twirling, and the reflection of the flowers\nconfusing the eyes. Far and wide, the rays of light, shed by the\nlanterns, intermingled their brilliancy, while, from time to time, fine\nstrains of music sounded with clamorous din. But it would be impossible\nto express adequately the perfect harmony in the aspect of this scene,\nand the grandeur of affluence and splendour.\n\nThe imperial consort of the Chia family, we must now observe, upon\ncatching sight, from the interior of her chair, of the picture presented\nwithin as well as without the confines of this garden, shook her head\nand heaved a sigh. \"What lavish extravagance! What excessive waste!\" she\nsoliloquised.\n\nBut of a sudden was again seen a eunuch who, on his knees, invited her\nto get into a boat; and the Chia consort descended from the chair and\nstepped into the craft, when the expanse of a limpid stream met her\ngaze, whose grandeur resembled that of the dragon in its listless\ncourse. The stone bannisters, on each side, were one mass of air-tight\nlanterns, of every colour, made of crystal or glass, which threw out a\nlight like the lustre of silver or the brightness of snow.\n\nThe willow, almond and the whole lot of trees, on the upper side, were,\nit is true, without blossom and leaves; but pongee and damask silks,\npaper and lustring had been employed, together with rice-paper, to make\nflowers of, which had been affixed on the branches. Upon each tree were\nsuspended thousands of lanterns; and what is more, the lotus and aquatic\nplants, the ducks and water fowl in the pond had all, in like manner,\nbeen devised out of conches and clams, plumes and feathers. The various\nlanterns, above and below, vied in refulgence. In real truth, it was a\ncrystal region, a world of pearls and precious stones. On board the boat\nwere also every kind of lanterns representing such designs as are used\non flower-pots, pearl-laden portieres, embroidered curtains, oars of\ncinnamon wood, and paddles of magnolia, which need not of course be\nminutely described.\n\nThey entered a landing with a stone curb; and on this landing was\nerected a flat lantern upon which were plainly visible the four\ncharacters the \"Persicary beach and flower-laden bank.\" But, reader, you\nhave heard how that these four characters \"the persicary beach and the\nflower-laden bank,\" the motto \"a phoenix comes with dignified air,\" and\nthe rest owe one and all their origin to the unexpected test to which\nChia Cheng submitted, on a previous occasion, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's literary\nabilities; but how did it come about that they were actually adopted?\n\nYou must remember that the Chia family had been, generation after\ngeneration, given to the study of letters, so that it was only natural\nthat there should be among them one or two renowned writers of verses;\nfor how could they ever resemble the families of such upstarts, who only\nemploy puerile expressions as a makeshift to get through what they have\nto do? But the why and the wherefore must be sought in the past. The\nconsort, belonging to the Chia mansion, had, before she entered the\npalace, been, from her infancy, also brought up by dowager lady Chia;\nand when Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was subsequently added to the family, she was the eldest\nsister and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc the youngest child. The Chia consort, bearing in mind\nhow that she had, when her mother was verging on old age, at length\nobtained this younger brother, she for this reason doated upon him with\nsingle love; and as they were besides companions in their attendance\nupon old lady Chia, they were inseparable for even a moment. Before\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc had entered school, and when three or four years of age, he had\nalready received oral instruction from the imperial spouse Chia from the\ncontents of several books and had committed to memory several thousands\nof characters, for though they were only sister and brother, they were\nlike mother and child. And after she had entered the Palace, she was\nwont time and again to have letters taken out to her father and her\ncousins, urgently recommending them to be careful with his bringing up,\nthat if they were not strict, he could not possibly become good for\nanything, and that if they were immoderately severe, there was the\ndanger of something unpropitious befalling him, with the result,\nmoreover, that his grandmother would be stricken with sorrow; and this\nsolicitude on his account was never for an instant lost sight of by her.\n\nHence it was that Chia Cheng having, a few days back, heard his teacher\nextol him for his extreme abilities, he forthwith put him to the test on\nthe occasion of their ramble through the garden. And though (his\ncompositions) were not in the bold style of a writer of note, yet they\nwere productions of their own family, and would, moreover, be\ninstrumental, when the Chia consort had her notice attracted by them,\nand come to know that they were devised by her beloved brother, in also\nnot rendering nugatory the anxious interest which she had ever\nentertained on his behalf, and he, therefore, purposely adopted what had\nbeen suggested by Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc; while for those places, for which on that day\nno devices had been completed, a good number were again subsequently\ncomposed to make up what was wanted.\n\nAfter the Chia consort had, for we shall now return to her, perused the\nfour characters, she gave a smile. \"The two words 'flower-laden bank,'\"\nshe said, \"are really felicitous, so what use was there for 'persicary\nbeach?'\"\n\nWhen the eunuch in waiting heard this observation, he promptly jumped\noff the craft on to the bank, and at a flying pace hurried to\ncommunicate it to Chia Cheng, and Chia Cheng instantly effected the\nnecessary alteration.\n\nBy this time the craft had reached the inner bank, and leaving the boat,\nand mounting into her sedan chair, she in due course contemplated the\nmagnificent Jade-like Palace; the Hall of cinnamon wood, lofty and\nsublime; and the marble portals with the four characters in bold style:\nthe \"Precious confines of heavenly spirits,\" which the Chia consort gave\ndirections should be changed for the four words denoting: \"additional\nHall (for the imperial consort) on a visit to her parents.\" And\nforthwith making her entrance into the travelling lodge her gaze was\nattracted by torches burning in the court encompassing the heavens,\nfragments of incense strewn on the ground, fire-like trees and gem-like\nflowers, gold-like windows and jade-like bannisters. But it would be\ndifficult to give a full account of the curtains, which rolled up (as\nfine as a) shrimp's moustache; of the carpets of other skins spread on\nthe floor; of the tripods exhaling the fragrant aroma of the brain of\nthe musk deer; of the screens in a row resembling fans made of pheasant\ntails. Indeed, the gold-like doors and the windows like jade were\nsuggestive of the abode of spirits; while the halls made of cinnamon\nwood and the palace of magnolia timber, of the very homes of the\nimperial secondary consorts.\n\n\"Why is it,\" the Chia consort inquired, \"that there is no tablet in this\nHall?\"\n\nThe eunuch in waiting fell on his knees. \"This is the main Hall,\" he\nreverently replied, \"and the officials, outside the palace, did not\npresume to take upon themselves to suggest any motto.\"\n\nThe Chia consort shook her head and said not a word; whereupon the\neunuch, who acted as master of ceremonies, requested Her Majesty to\nascend the throne and receive homage. The band stationed on the two\nflights of steps struck up a tune, while two eunuchs ushered Chia She,\nChia Cheng and the other members on to the moonlike stage, where they\narranged themselves in order and ascended into the hall, but when the\nladies-in-waiting transmitted her commands that the homage could be\ndispensed with, they at once retraced their footsteps.\n\n(The master of the ceremonies), in like manner led forward the dowager\nlady of the Jung Kuo mansion, as well as the female relatives, from the\nsteps on the east side, on to the moon-like stage; where they were\nplaced according to their ranks. But the maids-of-honour again commanded\nthat they should dispense with the ceremony, so they likewise promptly\nwithdrew.\n\nAfter tea had been thrice presented, the Chia consort descended the\nThrone, and the music ceased. She retired into a side room to change her\ncostume, and the private chairs were then got ready for her visit to her\nparents. Issuing from the garden, she came into the main quarters\nbelonging to dowager lady Chia, where she was bent upon observing the\ndomestic conventionalities, when her venerable ladyship, and the other\nmembers of the family, prostrated themselves in a body before her, and\nmade her desist. Tears dropped down from the eyes of the Chia consort as\n(she and her relatives) mutually came forward, and greeted each other,\nand as with one hand she grasped old lady Chia, and with the other she\nheld madame Wang, the three had plenty in their hearts which they were\nfain to speak about; but, unable as each one of them was to give\nutterance to their feelings, all they did was to sob and to weep, as\nthey kept face to face to each other; while madame Hsing, widow Li Wan,\nWang Hsi-feng, and the three sisters: Ying Ch'un, T'an Ch'un, and Hsi\nCh'un, stood aside in a body shedding tears and saying not a word.\n\nAfter a long time, the Chia consort restrained her anguish, and forcing\na smile, she set to work to reassure old lady Chia and madame Wang.\n\"Having in days gone by,\" she urged, \"been sent to that place where no\nhuman being can be seen, I have to-day after extreme difficulty returned\nhome; and now that you ladies and I have been reunited, instead of\nchatting or laughing we contrariwise give way to incessant tears! But\nshortly, I shall be gone, and who knows when we shall be able again to\neven see each other!\"\n\nWhen she came to this sentence, they could not help bursting into\nanother tit of crying; and Madame Hsing hastened to come forward, and to\nconsole dowager lady Chia and the rest. But when the Chia consort\nresumed her seat, and one by one came again, in turn, to exchange\nsalutations, they could not once more help weeping and sobbing for a\ntime.\n\nNext in order, were the managers and servants of the eastern and western\nmansions to perform their obeisance in the outer pavilion; and after the\nmarried women and waiting-maids had concluded their homage, the Chia\nconsort heaved a sigh. \"How many relatives,\" she observed, \"there are\nall of whom, alas! I may not see.\"\n\n\"There are here now,\" madame Wang rejoined with due respect, \"kindred\nwith outside family names, such as Mrs. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh, n\u00c3\u00a9e Wang, Pao-ch'ai, and\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc waiting for your commands; but as they are distant relatives, and\nwithout official status, they do not venture to arrogate to themselves\nthe right of entering into your presence.\" But the Chia consort issued\ndirections that they should be invited to come that they should see each\nother; and in a short while, Mrs. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh and the other relatives walked\nin, but as they were on the point of performing the rites, prescribed by\nthe state, she bade them relinquish the observance so that they came\nforward, and each, in turn, alluded to what had transpired during the\nlong separation.\n\nPao Ch'in also and a few other waiting-maids, whom the Chia consort had\noriginally taken along with her into the palace, knocked their heads\nbefore dowager lady Chia, but her ladyship lost no time in raising them\nup, and in bidding them go into a separate suite of rooms to be\nentertained; and as for the retainers, eunuchs as well as\nmaids-of-honour, ladies-in-waiting and every attendant, there were\nneedless to say, those in the two places, the Ning mansion and Chia\nShe's residence, to wait upon them; there only remained three or four\nyoung eunuchs to answer the summons.\n\nThe mother and daughter and her cousins conversed for some time on what\nhad happened during the protracted separation, as well as on domestic\naffairs and their private feelings, when Chia Cheng likewise advanced as\nfar as the other side of the portiere, and inquired after her health,\nand the Chia consort from inside performed the homage and other\nconventionalities (due to her parent).\n\n\"The families of farmers,\" she further went on to say to her father,\n\"feed on salted cabbage, and clothe in cotton material; but they readily\nenjoy the happiness of the relationships established by heaven! We,\nhowever, relatives though we now be of one bone and flesh, are, with all\nour affluence and honours, living apart from each other, and deriving no\nhappiness whatsoever!\"\n\nChia Cheng, on his part endeavoured, to restrain his tears. \"I\nbelonged,\" he rejoined, \"to a rustic and poor family; and among that\nwhole number of pigeons and pheasants, how could I have imagined that I\nwould have obtained the blessing of a hidden phoenix! Of late all for\nthe sake of your honourable self, His Majesty, above, confers upon us\nhis heavenly benefits; while we, below, show forth the virtue of our\nancestors! And it is mainly because the vital principle of the hills,\nstreams, sun, and moon, and the remote virtue of our ancestors have been\nimplanted in you alone that this good fortune has attained me Cheng and\nmy wife! Moreover, the present emperor, bearing in mind the great bounty\nshewn by heaven and earth in promoting a ceaseless succession, has\nvouchsafed a more generous act of grace than has ever been displayed\nfrom old days to the present. And although we may besmear our liver and\nbrain in the mire, how could we show our gratitude, even to so slight a\ndegree as one ten-thousandth part. But all I can do is, in the daytime,\nto practise diligence, vigilance at night, and loyalty in my official\nduties. My humble wish is that His Majesty, my master, may live ten\nthousand years and see thousands of autumns, so as to promote the\nwelfare of all mankind in the world! And you, worthy imperial consort,\nmust, on no account, be mindful of me Cheng and my wife, decrepid as we\nare in years. What I would solicit more than anything is that you should\nbe more careful of yourself, and that you should be diligent and\nreverential in your service to His Majesty, with the intent that you may\nnot prove ungrateful of his affectionate regard and bountiful grace.\"\n\nThe Chia consort, on the other hand, enjoined \"that much as it was\nexpedient to display zeal, in the management of state matters, it\nbehoved him, when he had any leisure, to take good care of himself, and\nthat he should not, whatever he did, give way to solicitude on her\nbehalf.\" And Chia Cheng then went on to say \"that the various\ninscriptions in the park over the pavilions, terraces, halls and\nresidences had been all composed by Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, and, that in the event of\nthere being one or two that could claim her attention, he would be happy\nif it would please her to at once favour him with its name.\" Whereupon\nthe imperial consort Y\u00c3\u00bcan, when she heard that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc could compose\nverses, forthwith exclaimed with a smile: \"He has in very truth made\nprogress!\"\n\nAfter Chia Cheng had retired out of the hall, the Chia consort made it a\npoint to ask: \"How is it that I do not see Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc?\" and dowager lady\nChia explained: \"An outside male relative as he is, and without official\nrank, he does not venture to appear before you of his own accord.\"\n\n\"Bring him in!\" the imperial consort directed; whereupon a young eunuch\nushered Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc in. After he had first complied with the state\nceremonies, she bade him draw near to her, and taking his hand, she held\nit in her lap, and, as she went on to caress his head and neck, she\nsmiled and said: \"He's grown considerably taller than he was before;\"\nbut she had barely concluded this remark, when her tears ran down as\nprofuse as rain. Mrs. Yu, lady Feng, and the rest pressed forward. \"The\nbanquet is quite ready,\" they announced, \"and your highness is requested\nto favour the place with your presence.\"\n\nThe imperial consort Yuan stood up and asking Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc to lead the way,\nshe followed in his steps, along with the whole party, and betook\nherself on foot as far as the entrance of the garden gate, whence she at\nonce espied, in the lustre shed by the lanterns, every kind of\ndecorations. Entering the garden, they first passed the spots with the\ndevice \"a phoenix comes with dignified air,\" \"the red (flowers are)\nfragrant and the green (banana leaves like) jade!\" \"the sign on the\napricot tree is visible,\" \"the fragrance pure of the ligularia and\niris,\" and other places; and ascending the towers they walked up the\nhalls, forded the streams and wound round the hills; contemplating as\nthey turned their gaze from side to side, each place arranged in a\ndifferent style, and each kind of article laid out in unique designs.\nThe Chia consort expressed her admiration in most profuse eulogiums, and\nthen went on to advise them: \"that it was not expedient to indulge in\nfuture in such excessive extravagance and that all these arrangements\nwere over and above what should have been done.\"\n\nPresently they reached the main pavilion, where she commanded that they\ncould dispense with the rites and take their seats. A sumptuous banquet\nwas laid out, at which dowager lady Chia and the other ladies occupied\nthe lower seats and entertained each other, while Mrs. Yu, widow Li Wan,\nlady Feng and the rest presented the soup and handed the cups. The\nImperial consort Yuan subsequently directed that the pencils and\ninkslabs should be brought, and with her own hands she opened the silken\npaper. She chose the places she liked, and conferred upon them a name;\nand devising a general designation for the garden, she called it the Ta\nKuan garden (Broad vista), while for the tablet of the main pavilion the\ndevice she composed ran as follows: \"Be mindful of the grace and\nremember the equity (of His Majesty);\" with this inscription on the\nantithetical scrolls:\n\n  Mercy excessive Heaven and earth display,\n  And it men young and old hail gratefully;\n  From old till now they pour their bounties great\n  Those rich gifts which Cathay and all states permeate.\n\nChanging also the text: \"A phoenix comes with dignified air for the\nHsiao Hsiang Lodge.\"\n\n\"The red (flowers are) fragrant and the green (banana leaves like)\njade,\" she altered into \"Happy red and joyful green\"; bestowing upon the\nplace the appellation of the I Hung court (joyful red). The spot where\n\"the fragrance pure of the ligularia and iris,\" was inscribed, she\ncalled \"the ligularia and the 'Wu' weed court;\" and where was \"the sign\nin the apricot tree is visible,\" she designated \"the cottage in the\nhills where dolichos is bleached.\" The main tower she called the Broad\nVista Tower. The lofty tower facing the east, she designated \"the\nvariegated and flowery Hall;\" bestowing on the line of buildings, facing\nthe west, the appellation of \"the Hall of Occult Fragrance;\" and besides\nthese figured such further names as: \"the Hall of peppery wind,\" \"the\nArbour of lotus fragrance,\" \"the Islet of purple caltrop,\" \"the Bank of\ngolden lotus,\" and the like. There were also tablets with four\ncharacters such as: \"the peach blossom and the vernal rain;\" \"the\nautumnal wind prunes the Eloecocca,\" \"the artemisia leaves and the night\nsnow,\" and other similar names which could not all be placed on record.\nShe furthermore directed that such tablets as were already put up,\nshould not be dismounted, and she forthwith took the lead and composed\nan heptameter stanza, the burden of which was:\n\n  Hills it enclasps, embraces streams, with skill it is laid out:\n  What task the grounds to raise! the works to start and bring about!\n  Of scenery in heaven and amongst men store has been made;\n  The name Broad Vista o'er the fragrant park should be engraved.\n\nWhen she had finished writing, she observed smilingly, as she addressed\nherself to all the young ladies: \"I have all along lacked the quality of\nsharpness and never besides been good at verses; as you, sisters, and\nall of you have ever been aware; but, on a night like this I've been\nfain to do my best, with the object of escaping censure, and of not\nreflecting injustice on this scenery and nothing more. But some other\nday when I've got time, be it ever so little, I shall deem it my duty to\nmake up what remains by inditing a record of the Broad Vista Garden, as\nwell as a song on my visit to my parents and other such literary\nproductions in memory of the events of this day. You sisters and others\nmust, each of you, in like manner compose a stanza on the motto on each\ntablet, expressing your sentiments, as you please, without being\nrestrained by any regard for my meagre ability. Knowing as I do besides\nthat Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc is, indeed, able to write verses, I feel the more delighted!\nBut among his compositions, those I like the best are those in the two\nplaces, 'the Hsiao Hsiang Lodge,' and 'the court of Heng and Wu;' and\nnext those of 'the Joyful red court,' and 'the cottage in the hills,\nwhere the dolichos is bleached.' As for grand sites like these four,\nthere should be found some out-of-the-way expressions to insert in the\nverses so that they should be felicitous. The antithetical lines\ncomposed by you, (Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc), on a former occasion are excellent, it is\ntrue; but you should now further indite for each place, a pentameter\nstanza, so that by allowing me to test you in my presence, you may not\nshow yourself ungrateful for the trouble I have taken in teaching you\nfrom your youth up.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc had no help but to assent, and descending from the hall, he went\noff all alone to give himself up to reflection.\n\nOf the three Ying Ch'un, T'an Ch'un, and Hsi Ch'un, T'an Ch'un must be\nconsidered to have also been above the standard of her sisters, but she,\nin her own estimation, imagined it, in fact, difficult to compete with\nHs\u00c3\u00bceh Pao-ch'ai and Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc. With no alternative however than that of\ndoing her best, she followed the example of all the rest with the sole\npurpose of warding off criticism. And Li Wan too succeeded, after much\nexertion, in putting together a stanza.\n\nThe consort of the Chia family perused in due order the verses written\nby the young ladies, the text of which is given below.\n\nThe lines written by Ying Ch'un on the tablet of \"Boundless spirits and\nblissful heart\" were:\n\n  A park laid out with scenery surpassing fine and rare!\n  Submissive to thy will, on boundless bliss bashful I write!\n  Who could believe that yonder scenes in this world found a share!\n  Will not thy heart be charmed on thy visit by the sight?\n\nThese are the verses by T'an Ch'un on the tablet of \"All nature vies in\nsplendour\":\n\n  Of aspect lofty and sublime is raised a park of fame!\n  Honoured with thy bequest, my shallow lore fills me with shame.\n  No words could e'er amply exhaust the beauteous skill,\n  For lo! in very truth glory and splendour all things fill!\n\nThus runs Hsi Ch'un's stanza on the tablet of the \"Conception of\nliterary compositions\":\n\n  The hillocks and the streams crosswise beyond a thousand li extend!\n  The towers and terraces 'midst the five-coloured clouds lofty ascend!\n  In the resplendent radiance of both sun and moon the park it lies!\n  The skill these scenes to raise the skill e'en essays to conceive\n      outvies!\n\nThe lines composed by Li Wan on the tablet \"grace and elegance,\"\nconsisted of:\n\n  The comely streams and hillocks clear, in double folds, embrace;\n  E'en Fairyland, forsooth, transcend they do in elegance and grace!\n  The \"Fragrant Plant\" the theme is of the ballad fan, green-made.\n  Like drooping plum-bloom flap the lapel red and the Hsiang gown.\n  From prosperous times must have been handed down those pearls and\n      jade.\n  What bliss! the fairy on the jasper terrace will come down!\n  When to our prayers she yields, this glorious park to contemplate,\n  No mortal must e'er be allowed these grounds to penetrate.\n\nThe ode by Hs\u00c3\u00bceh Pao-ch'ai on the tablet of \"Concentrated Splendour and\nAccumulated auspiciousness\" was:\n\n  Raised on the west of the Imperial city, lo! the park stored with\n      fragrant smell,\n  Shrouded by Phoebe's radiant rays and clouds of good omen, in wondrous\n      glory lies!\n  The willows tall with joy exult that the parrots their nests have\n      shifted from the dell.\n  The bamboo groves, when laid, for the phoenix with dignity to come,\n      were meant to rise.\n  The very eve before the Empress' stroll, elegant texts were ready and\n      affixed.\n  If even she her parents comes to see, how filial piety supreme must\n      be!\n  When I behold her beauteous charms and talents supernatural, with awe\n      transfixed,\n  One word, to utter more how can I troth ever presume, when shame\n      overpowers me.\n\nThe distich by Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc on the tablet of \"Spiritual stream outside the\nworld,\" ran thus:\n\n  Th' imperial visit doth enhance joy and delight.\n  This fairy land from mortal scenes what diff'rent sight!\n  The comely grace it borrows of both hill and stream;\n  And to the landscape it doth add a charm supreme.\n  The fumes of Chin Ku wine everything permeate;\n  The flowers the inmate of the Jade Hall fascinate.\n  The imperial favour to receive how blessed our lot!\n  For oft the palace carriage will pass through this spot.\n\nThe Chia consort having concluded the perusal of the verses, and\nextolled them for a time: \"After all,\" she went on to say with a smile,\n\"those composed by my two cousins, Hs\u00c3\u00bceh Pao-ch'ai and Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc,\ndiffer in excellence from those of all the rest; and neither I, stupid\nas I am, nor my sisters can attain their standard.\"\n\nLin Tao-y\u00c3\u00bc had, in point of fact, made up her mind to display, on this\nevening, her extraordinary abilities to their best advantage, and to put\ndown every one else, but contrary to her expectations the Chia consort\nhad expressed her desire that no more than a single stanza should be\nwritten on each tablet, so that unable, after all, to disregard her\ndirections by writing anything in excess, she had no help but to compose\na pentameter stanza, in an offhand way, merely with the intent of\ncomplying with her wishes.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc had by this time not completed his task. He had just finished two\nstanzas on the Hsiao Hsiang Lodge and the Heng Wu garden, and was just\nthen engaged in composing a verse on the \"Happy red Court.\" In his draft\nfigured a line: \"The (leaves) of jade-like green in spring are yet\nrolled up,\" which Pao-ch'ai stealthily observed as she turned her eyes\nfrom side to side; and availing herself of the very first moment, when\nnone of the company could notice her, she gave him a nudge. \"As her\nhighness,\" she remarked, \"doesn't relish the four characters,\nrepresenting the red (flowers are) fragrant, and the green (banana\nleaves) like jade, she changed them, just a while back, for 'the joyful\nred and gladsome green;' and if you deliberately now again employ these\ntwo words 'jade-like green,' won't it look as if you were bent upon\nbeing at variance with her? Besides, very many are the old books, in\nwhich the banana leaves form the theme, so you had better think of\nanother line and substitute it and have done with it!\"\n\nWhen Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc heard the suggestion made by Pao-ch'ai, he speedily replied,\nas he wiped off the perspiration: \"I can't at all just at present call\nto mind any passage from the contents of some old book.\"\n\n\"Just simply take,\" proposed Pao-ch'ai smilingly, \"the character jade in\njade-like green and change it into the character wax, that's all.\"\n\n\"Does 'green wax,'\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc inquired, \"come out from anywhere?\"\n\nPao-ch'ai gently smacked her lips and nodded her head as she laughed. \"I\nfear,\" she said, \"that if, on an occasion like to-night, you show no\nmore brains than this, by and by when you have to give any answers in\nthe golden hall, to the questions (of the examiner), you will, really,\nforget (the very first four names) of Chao, Oh'ien, Sun and Li (out of\nthe hundred)! What, have you so much as forgotten the first line of the\npoem by Han Y\u00c3\u00bc, of the T'ang dynasty, on the Banana leaf:\n\n \"Cold is the candle and without a flame, the green wax dry?\"\n\nOn hearing these words, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's mind suddenly became enlightened. \"What\na fool I am!\" he added with a simper; \"I couldn't for the moment even\nremember the lines, ready-made though they were and staring at me in my\nvery eyes! Sister, you really can be styled my teacher, little though\nyou may have taught me, and I'll henceforward address you by no other\nname than 'teacher,' and not call you 'sister' any more!\"\n\n\"Don't you yet hurry to go on,\" Pao-ch'ai again observed in a gentle\ntone of voice sneeringly, \"but keep on calling me elder sister and\nyounger sister? Who's your sister? that one over there in a yellow coat\nis your sister!\"\n\nBut apprehending, as she bandied these jokes, lest she might be wasting\nhis time, she felt constrained to promptly move away; whereupon Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\ncontinued the ode he had been working at, and brought it to a close,\nwriting in all three stanzas.\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc had not had so far an opportunity of making a display of her\nability, and was feeling at heart in a very dejected mood; but when she\nperceived that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was having intense trouble in conceiving what he\nhad to write, and she found, upon walking up to the side of the table,\nthat he had only one stanza short, that on \"the sign on the apricot tree\nis visible,\" she consequently bade him copy out clean the first three\nodes, while she herself composed a stanza, which she noted down on a\nslip of paper, rumpled up into a ball, and threw just in front of\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc.\n\nAs soon as Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc opened it and glanced at it, he realised that it was a\nhundred times better than his own three stanzas, and transcribing it\nwithout loss of time, in a bold writing, he handed up his compositions.\n\nOn perusal, the Chia Consort read what follows. By Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, on: \"A\nphoenix comes with dignified air:\"\n\n  The bamboos just now don that jadelike grace,\n  Which worthy makes them the pheasant to face;\n  Each culm so tender as if to droop fain,\n  Each one so verdant, in aspect so cool,\n  The curb protects, from the steps wards the pool.\n  The pervious screens the tripod smell restrain.\n  The shadow will be strewn, mind do not shake\n  And (Hsieh) from her now long fine dream (awake)!\n\nOn \"the pure fragrance of the Ligularia and Iris Florentina:\"\n\n  Hengs and Wus the still park permeate;\n  The los and pis their sweet perfume enhance;\n  And supple charms the third spring flowers ornate;\n  Softly is wafted one streak of fragrance!\n  A light mist doth becloud the tortuous way!\n  With moist the clothes bedews, that verdure cold!\n  The pond who ever sinuous could hold?\n  Dreams long and subtle, dream the household Hsieh.\n\nOn \"the happy red and joyful green:\"\n\n  Stillness pervades the deep pavilion on a lengthy day.\n  The green and red, together matched, transcendent grace display.\n  Unfurled do still remain in spring the green and waxlike leaves.\n  No sleep yet seeks the red-clad maid, though night's hours be\n      far-spent,\n  But o'er the rails lo, she reclines, dangling her ruddy sleeves;\n  Against the stone she leans shrouded by taintless scent,\n  And stands the quarter facing whence doth blow the eastern wind!\n  Her lord and master must look up to her with feelings kind.\n\nOn \"the sign on the apricot tree is visible:\"\n\n  The apricot tree sign to drink wayfarers doth invite;\n  A farm located on a hill, lo! yonder strikes the sight!\n  And water caltrops, golden lotus, geese, as well as flows,\n  And mulberry and elm trees which afford rest to swallows.\n  That wide extent of spring leeks with verdure covers the ground;\n  And o'er ten li the paddy blossom fragrance doth abound.\n  In days of plenty there's a lack of dearth and of distress,\n  And what need then is there to plough and weave with such briskness?\n\nWhen the Chia consort had done with the perusal, excessive joy filled\nher heart. \"He has indeed made progress!\" she exclaimed, and went on to\npoint at the verses on \"the sign on the apricot tree,\" as being the\ncrowning piece of the four stanzas. In due course, she with her own\nhands changed the motto \"a cottage in the hills where dolichos is\nbleached\" into \"the paddy-scented village;\" and bidding also T'an Ch'un\nto take the several tens of stanzas written then, and to transcribe them\nseparately on ornamented silk paper, she commanded a eunuch to send them\nto the outer quarters. And when Chia Cheng and the other men perused\nthem, one and all sung their incessant praise, while Chia Cheng, on his\npart, sent in some complimentary message, with regard to her return home\non a visit.\n\nYuan Ch'un went further and gave orders that luscious wines, a ham and\nother such presents should be conferred upon Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, as well as upon\nChia Lan. This Chia Lan was as yet at this time a perfect youth without\nany knowledge of things in general, so that all that he could do was to\nfollow the example of his mother, and imitate his uncle in performing\nthe conventional rites.\n\nAt the very moment that Chia Se felt unable, along with a company of\nactresses, to bear the ordeal of waiting on the ground floor of the\ntwo-storied building, he caught sight of a eunuch come running at a\nflying pace. \"The composition of verses is over,\" he said, \"so quick\ngive me the programme;\" whereupon Chia Se hastened to present the\nprogramme as well as a roll of the names of the twelve girls. And not a\nlong interval elapsed before four plays were chosen; No. 1 being the\nImperial Banquet; No. 2 Begging (the weaver goddess) for skill in\nneedlework; No. 3 The spiritual match; and No. 4 the Parting spirit.\nChia Se speedily lent a hand in the getting up, and the preparations for\nthe performance, and each of the girls sang with a voice sufficient to\nsplit the stones and danced in the manner of heavenly spirits; and\nthough their exterior was that of the characters in which they were\ndressed up for the play, their acting nevertheless represented, in a\nperfect manner, both sorrow as well as joy. As soon as the performance\nwas brought to a close, a eunuch walked in holding a golden salver\ncontaining cakes, sweets, and the like, and inquired who was Ling Kuan;\nand Chia Se readily concluding that these articles were presents\nbestowed upon Ling Kuan, made haste to take them over, as he bade Ling\nKuan prostrate herself.\n\n\"The honourable consort,\" the eunuch further added, \"directs that Ling\nKuan, who is the best actress of the lot, should sing two more songs;\nany two will do, she does not mind what they are.\"\n\nChia Se at once expressed his obedience, and felt constrained to urge\nLing Kuan to sing the two ballads entitled: \"The walk through the\ngarden\" and \"Frightened out of a dream.\" But Ling Kuan asserted that\nthese two ballads had not originally been intended for her own role; and\nbeing firm in her refusal to accede and insisting upon rendering the two\nsongs \"The Mutual Promise\" and \"The Mutual Abuse,\" Chia Se found it hard\nto bring her round, and had no help but to let her have her own way. The\nChia consort was so extremely enchanted with her that she gave\ndirections that she should not be treated harshly, and that this girl\nshould receive a careful training, while besides the fixed number of\npresents, she gave her two rolls of palace silk, two purses, gold and\nsilver ingots, and presents in the way of eatables.\n\nSubsequently, when the banquet had been cleared, and she once more\nprosecuted her visit through those places to which she had not been, she\nquite accidentally espied the Buddhist Temple encircled by hills, and\npromptly rinsing her hands, she walked in and burnt incense and\nworshipped Buddha. She also composed the device for a tablet, \"a humane\nboat on the (world's) bitter sea,\" and went likewise so far as to show\nspecial acts of additional grace to a company of ascetic nuns and Taoist\npriestesses.\n\nA eunuch came in a short while and reverently fell on his knees. \"The\npresents are all in readiness,\" he reported, \"and may it please you to\ninspect them and to distribute them, in compliance with custom;\" and\npresented to her a list, which the Chia consort perused from the very\ntop throughout without raising any objection, and readily commanding\nthat action should be taken according to the list, a eunuch descended\nand issued the gifts one after another. The presents for dowager lady\nChia consisted, it may be added, of two sceptres, one of gold, the other\nof jade, with \"may your wishes be fulfilled\" inscribed on them; a staff\nmade of lign-aloes; a string of chaplet beads of Chia-nan fragrant wood;\nfour rolls of imperial satins with words \"Affluence and honours\" and\nPerennial Spring (woven in them); four rolls of imperial silk with\nPerennial Happiness and Longevity; two shoes of purple gold bullion,\nrepresenting a pen, an ingot and \"as you like;\" and ten silver ingots\nwith the device \"Felicitous Blessings.\" While the two shares for madame\nHsing and madame Wang were only short of hers by the sceptres and\nstaffs, four things in all. Chia She, Chia Cheng and the others had each\napportioned to him a work newly written by the Emperor, two boxes of\nsuperior ink, and gold and silver cups, two pairs of each; their other\ngifts being identical with those above. Pao-ch'ai, Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, all the\nsisters and the rest were assigned each a copy of a new book, a fine\nslab and two pair of gold and silver ornaments of a novel kind and\noriginal shape; Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc likewise receiving the same presents. Chia Lan's\ngifts consisted of two necklets, one of gold, the other of silver, and\nof two pair of gold ingots. Mrs. Yu, widow Li Wan, lady Feng and the\nothers had each of them, four ingots of gold and silver; and, in the way\nof keepsakes, four pieces of silk. There were, in addition, presents\nconsisting of twenty-four pieces of silk and a thousand strings of good\ncash to be allotted to the nurses, and waiting-maids, in the apartments\nof dowager lady Chia, madame Wang and of the respective sisters; while\nChia Chen, Chia Lien, Chia Huan, Chia Jung and the rest had, every one,\nfor presents, a piece of silk, and a pair of gold and silver ingots.\n\nAs regards the other gifts, there were a hundred rolls of various\ncoloured silks, a thousand ounces of pure silver, and several bottles of\nimperial wine, intended to be bestowed upon all the men-servants of the\nmansions, on the East and the West, as well as upon those who had been\nin the garden overseeing works, arranging the decorations, and in\nwaiting to answer calls, and upon those who looked after the theatres\nand managed the lanterns. There being, besides, five hundred strings of\npure cash for the cooks, waiters, jugglers and hundreds of actors and\nevery kind of domestic.\n\nThe whole party had finished giving expression to their thanks for her\nbounty, when the managers and eunuchs respectfully announced: \"It is\nalready a quarter to three, and may it please your Majesty to turn back\nyour imperial chariot;\" whereupon, much against her will, the Chia\nconsort's eyes brimmed over, and she once more gave vent to tears.\nForcing herself however again to put on a smile, she clasped old lady\nChia's and madame Wang's hands, and could not bring herself to let them\ngo; while she repeatedly impressed upon their minds: that there was no\nneed to give way to any solicitude, and that they should take good care\nof their healths; that the grace of the present emperor was so vast,\nthat once a month he would grant permission for them to enter the palace\nand pay her a visit. \"It is easy enough for us to see each other,\" (she\nsaid,) \"and why should we indulge in any excess of grief? But when his\nmajesty in his heavenly generosity allows me another time to return\nhome, you shouldn't go in for such pomp and extravagance.\"\n\nDowager lady Chia and the other inmates had already cried to such an\nextent that sobs choked their throats and they could with difficulty\ngive utterance to speech. But though the Chia consort could not\nreconcile herself to the separation, the usages in vogue in the imperial\nhousehold could not be disregarded or infringed, so that she had no\nalternative but to stifle the anguish of her heart, to mount her\nchariot, and take her departure.\n\nThe whole family experienced meanwhile a hard task before they succeeded\nin consoling the old lady and madame Wang and in supporting them away\nout of the garden. But as what follows is not ascertained, the next\nchapter will disclose it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n  In the vehemence of her feelings, Hua (Hsi Jen) on a quiet evening\n      admonishes Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc.\n  While (the spell) of affection continues unbroken, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, on a still\n      day, perceives the fragrance emitted from Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc's person.\n\n\nThe Chia consort, we must now go on to explain, returned to the Palace,\nand the next day, on her appearance in the presence of His Majesty, she\nthanked him for his bounty and gave him furthermore an account of her\nexperiences on her visit home. His Majesty's dragon countenance was much\nelated, and he also issued from the privy store coloured satins, gold\nand silver and such like articles to be presented to Chia Cheng and the\nother officials in the various households of her relatives. But\ndispensing with minute details about them, we will now revert to the two\nmansions of Jung and Ning.\n\nWith the extreme strain on mind and body for successive days, the\nstrength of one and all was, in point of fact, worn out and their\nrespective energies exhausted. And it was besides after they had been\nputting by the various decorations and articles of use for two or three\ndays, that they, at length, got through the work.\n\nLady Feng was the one who had most to do, and whose responsibilities\nwere greatest. The others could possibly steal a few leisure moments and\nretire to rest, while she was the sole person who could not slip away.\nIn the second place, naturally anxious as she was to excel and both to\nfall in people's estimation, she put up with the strain just as if she\nwere like one of those who had nothing to attend to. But the one who had\nthe least to do and had the most leisure was Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc.\n\nAs luck would have it on this day, at an early hour, Hsi Jen's mother\ncame again in person and told dowager lady Chia that she would take Hsi\nJen home to drink a cup of tea brewed in the new year and that she would\nreturn in the evening. For this reason Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was only in the company of\nall the waiting-maids, throwing dice, playing at chess and amusing\nhimself. But while he was in the room playing with them with a total\nabsence of zest, he unawares perceived a few waiting-maids arrive, who\ninformed him that their senior master Mr. Chen, of the Eastern Mansion,\nhad come to invite him to go and see a theatrical performance, and the\nfireworks, which were to be let off.\n\nUpon hearing these words, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc speedily asked them to change his\nclothes; but just as he was ready to start, presents of cream, steamed\nwith sugar, arrived again when least expected from the Chia Consort, and\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc recollecting with what relish Hsi Jen had partaken of this dish\non the last occasion forthwith bid them keep it for her; while he went\nhimself and told dowager lady Chia that he was going over to see the\nplay.\n\nThe plays sung over at Chia Chen's consisted, who would have thought it,\nof \"Ting L'ang recognises his father,\" and \"Huang Po-ying deploys the\nspirits for battle,\" and in addition to these, \"Sung Hsing-che causes\ngreat commotion in the heavenly palace;\" \"Ghiang T'ai-kung kills the\ngeneral and deifies him,\" and other such like. Soon appeared the spirits\nand devils in a confused crowd on the stage, and suddenly also became\nvisible the whole band of sprites and goblins, among which were some\nwaving streamers, as they went past in a procession, invoking Buddha and\nburning incense. The sound of the gongs and drums and of shouts and\ncries were audible at a distance beyond the lane; and in the whole\nstreet, one and all extolled the performance as exceptionally grand, and\nthat the like could never have been had in the house of any other\nfamily.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, noticing that the commotion and bustle had reached a stage so\nunbearable to his taste, speedily betook himself, after merely sitting\nfor a little while, to other places in search of relaxation and fun.\nFirst of all, he entered the inner rooms, and after spending some time\nin chatting and laughing with Mrs. Yu, the waiting-maids, and secondary\nwives, he eventually took his departure out of the second gate; and as\nMrs. Yu and her companions were still under the impression that he was\ngoing out again to see the play, they let him speed on his way, without\nso much as keeping an eye over him.\n\nChia Chen, Chia Lien, Hs\u00c3\u00baeh P'an and the others were bent upon guessing\nenigmas, enforcing the penalties and enjoying themselves in a hundred\nand one ways, so that even allowing that they had for a moment noticed\nthat he was not occupying his seat, they must merely have imagined that\nhe had gone inside and not, in fact, worried their minds about him. And\nas for the pages, who had come along with Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, those who were a\nlittle advanced in years, knowing very well that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc would, on an\noccasion like the present, be sure not to be going before dusk,\nstealthily therefore took advantage of his absence, those, who could, to\ngamble for money, and others to go to the houses of relatives and\nfriends to drink of the new year tea, so that what with gambling and\ndrinking the whole bevy surreptitiously dispersed, waiting for dusk\nbefore they came back; while those, who were younger, had all crept into\nthe green rooms to watch the excitement; with the result that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\nperceiving not one of them about bethought himself of a small reading\nroom, which existed in previous days on this side, in which was\nsuspended a picture of a beauty so artistically executed as to look\nlife-like. \"On such a bustling day as this,\" he reasoned, \"it's pretty\ncertain, I fancy, that there will be no one in there; and that beautiful\nperson must surely too feel lonely, so that it's only right that I\nshould go and console her a bit.\" With these thoughts, he hastily betook\nhimself towards the side-house yonder, and as soon as he came up to the\nwindow, he heard the sound of groans in the room. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was really\nquite startled. \"What!\" (he thought), \"can that beautiful girl,\npossibly, have come to life!\" and screwing up his courage, he licked a\nhole in the paper of the window and peeped in. It was not she, however,\nwho had come to life, but Ming Yen holding down a girl and likewise\nindulging in what the Monitory Dream Fairy had taught him.\n\n\"Dreadful!\" exclaimed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, aloud, unable to repress himself, and,\nstamping one of his feet, he walked into the door to the terror of both\nof them, who parting company, shivered with fear, like clothes that are\nbeing shaken. Ming Yen perceiving that it was Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc promptly fell on\nhis knees and piteously implored for pardon.\n\n\"What! in broad daylight! what do you mean by it? Were your master Mr.\nChen to hear of it, would you die or live?\" asked Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, as he\nsimultaneously cast a glance at the servant-girl, who although not a\nbeauty was anyhow so spick and span, and possessed besides a few charms\nsufficient to touch the heart. From shame, her face was red and her ears\npurple, while she lowered her head and uttered not a syllable.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc stamped his foot. \"What!\" he shouted, \"don't you yet bundle\nyourself away!\"\n\nThis simple remark suggested the idea to the girl's mind who ran off, as\nif she had wings to fly with; but as Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc went also so far as to go in\npursuit of her, calling out: \"Don't be afraid, I'm not one to tell\nanyone,\" Ming Yen was so exasperated that he cried, as he went after\nthem, \"My worthy ancestor, this is distinctly telling people about it.\"\n\n\"How old is that servant girl?\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc having asked; \"She's, I expect,\nno more than sixteen or seventeen,\" Ming Yen rejoined.\n\n\"Well, if you haven't gone so far as to even ascertain her age,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\nobserved, \"you're sure to know still less about other things; and it\nmakes it plain enough that her acquaintance with you is all vain and\nfutile! What a pity! what a pity!\"\n\nHe then went on to enquire what her name was; and \"Were I,\" continued\nMing Yen smiling, \"to tell you about her name it would involve a long\nyarn; it's indeed a novel and strange story! She relates that while her\nmother was nursing her, she dreamt a dream and obtained in this dream\npossession of a piece of brocaded silk, on which were designs, in\nvariegated colours, representing opulence and honour, and a continuous\nline of the character Wan; and that this reason accounts for the name of\nWan Erh, which was given her.\"\n\n\"This is really strange!\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc exclaimed with a grin, after lending an\near to what he had to say; \"and she is bound, I think, by and by to have\na good deal of good fortune!\"\n\nThese words uttered, he plunged in deep thought for a while, and Ming\nYen having felt constrained to inquire: \"Why aren't you, Mr. Secundus,\nwatching a theatrical performance of this excellent kind?\" \"I had been\nlooking on for ever so long,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc replied, \"until I got quite weary;\nand had just come out for a stroll, when I happened to meet you two. But\nwhat's to be done now?\"\n\nMing Yen gave a faint smile. \"As there's no one here to know anything\nabout it,\" he added, \"I'll stealthily take you, Mr. Secundus, for a walk\noutside the city walls; and we'll come back shortly, before they've got\nwind of it.\"\n\n\"That won't do,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc demurred, \"we must be careful, or else some\nbeggar might kidnap us away; besides, were they to come to hear of it,\nthere'll be again a dreadful row; and isn't it better that we should go\nto some nearer place, from which we could, after all, return at once?\"\n\n\"As for some nearer place,\" Ming Yen observed; \"to whose house can we\ngo? It's really no easy matter!\"\n\n\"My idea is,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc suggested with a smirk, \"that we should simply go,\nand find sister Hua, and see what she's up to at home.\"\n\n\"Yes! Yes!\" Ming Yen replied laughingly; \"the fact is I had forgotten\nall about her home; but should it reach their ears,\" he continued,\n\"they'll say that it was I who led you, Mr. Secundus, astray, and\nthey'll beat me!\"\n\n\"I'm here for you!\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc having assured him; Ming Yen at these words\nled the horses round, and the two of them speedily made their exit by\nthe back gate. Luckily Hsi Jen's house was not far off. It was no\nfurther than half a li's distance, so that in a twinkle they had already\nreached the front of the door, and Ming Yen was the first to walk in and\nto call for Hsi Jen's eldest brother Hua Tzu-fang.\n\nHsi Jen's mother had, on this occasion, united in her home Hsi Jen,\nseveral of her sister's daughters, as well as a few of her nieces, and\nthey were engaged in partaking of fruits and tea, when they heard some\none outside call out, \"Brother Hua.\" Hua Tzu-fang lost no time in\nrushing out; and upon looking and finding that it was the two of them,\nthe master and his servant, he was so taken by surprise that his fears\ncould not be set at rest. Promptly, he clasped Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc in his arms and\ndismounted him, and coming into the court, he shouted out at the top of\nhis voice: \"Mr. Pao has come.\" The other persons heard the announcement\nof his arrival, with equanimity, but when it reached Hsi Jen's ears, she\ntruly felt at such a loss to fathom the object of his visit that issuing\nhastily out of the room, she came to meet Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, and as she laid hold\nof him: \"Why did you come?\" she asked.\n\n\"I felt awfully dull,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc rejoined with a smile, \"and came to see\nwhat you were up to.\"\n\nHsi Jen at these words banished, at last, all anxiety from her mind.\n\"You're again up to your larks,\" she observed, \"but what's the aim of\nyour visit? Who else has come along with him?\" she at the same time went\non to question Ming Yen.\n\n\"All the others know nothing about it!\" explained Ming Yen exultingly;\n\"only we two do, that's all.\"\n\nWhen Hsi Jen heard this remark, she gave way afresh to solicitous fears:\n\"This is dreadful!\" she added; \"for were you to come across any one from\nthe house, or to meet master; or were, in the streets, people to press\nagainst you, or horses to collide with you, as to make (his horse) shy,\nand he were to fall, would that too be a joke? The gall of both of you\nis larger than a peck measure; but it's all you, Ming Yen, who has\nincited him, and when I go back, I'll surely tell the nurses to beat\nyou.\"\n\nMing Yen pouted his mouth. \"Mr. Secundus,\" he pleaded, \"abused me and\nbeat me, as he bade me bring him here, and now he shoves the blame on my\nshoulders! 'Don't let us go,' I suggested; 'but if you do insist, well\nthen let us go and have done.'\"\n\nHua Tzu-fang promptly interceded. \"Let things alone,\" he said; \"now that\nthey're already here, there's no need whatever of much ado. The only\nthing is that our mean house with its thatched roof is both so crammed\nand so filthy that how could you, sir, sit in it!\"\n\nHsi Jen's mother also came out at an early period to receive him, and\nHsi Jen pulled Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc in. Once inside the room, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc perceived three\nor five girls, who, as soon as they caught sight of him approaching, all\nlowered their heads, and felt so bashful that their faces were suffused\nwith blushes. But as both Hua Tzu-fang and his mother were afraid that\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc would catch cold, they pressed him to take a seat on the\nstove-bed, and hastened to serve a fresh supply of refreshments, and to\nat once bring him a cup of good tea.\n\n\"You needn't be flurrying all for nothing,\" Hsi Jen smilingly\ninterposed; \"I, naturally, should know; and there's no use of even\nlaying out any fruits, as I daren't recklessly give him anything to\neat.\"\n\nSaying this, she simultaneously took her own cushion and laid it on a\nstool, and after Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc took a seat on it, she placed the footstove she\nhad been using, under his feet; and producing, from a satchet, two\npeach-blossom-scented small cakes, she opened her own hand-stove and\nthrew them into the fire; which done, she covered it well again and\nplaced it in Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's lap. And eventually, she filled her own tea-cup\nwith tea and presented it to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, while, during this time, her mother\nand sister had been fussing about, laying out in fine array a tableful\nof every kind of eatables.\n\nHsi Jen noticed that there were absolutely no things that he could eat,\nbut she felt urged to say with a smile: \"Since you've come, it isn't\nright that you should go empty away; and you must, whether the things be\ngood or bad, taste a little, so that it may look like a visit to my\nhouse!\"\n\nAs she said this, she forthwith took several seeds of the fir-cone, and\ncracking off the thin skin, she placed them in a handkerchief and\npresented them to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. But Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, espying that Hsi Jen's two eyes\nwere slightly red, and that the powder was shiny and moist, quietly\ntherefore inquired of Hsi Jen, \"Why do you cry for no rhyme or reason?\"\n\n\"Why should I cry?\" Hsi Jen laughed; \"something just got into my eyes\nand I rubbed them.\" By these means she readily managed to evade\ndetection; but seeing that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc wore a deep red archery-sleeved\npelisse, ornamented with gold dragons, and lined with fur from foxes'\nribs and a grey sable fur surtout with a fringe round the border. \"What!\nhave you,\" she asked, \"put on again your new clothes for? specially to\ncome here? and didn't they inquire of you where you were going?\"\n\n\"I had changed,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc explained with a grin, \"as Mr. Chen had invited\nme to go over and look at the play.\"\n\n\"Well, sit a while and then go back;\" Hsi Jen continued as she nodded\nher head; \"for this isn't the place for you to come to!\"\n\n\"You'd better be going home now,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc suggested smirkingly; \"where\nI've again kept something good for you.\"\n\n\"Gently,\" smiled Hsi Jen, \"for were you to let them hear, what figure\nwould we cut?\" And with these, words, she put out her hand and\nunclasping from Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's neck the jade of Spiritual Perception, she\nfaced her cousins and remarked exultingly. \"Here! see for yourselves;\nlook at this and learn! When I repeatedly talked about it, you all\nthought it extraordinary, and were anxious to have a glance at it;\nto-day, you may gaze on it with all your might, for whatever precious\nthing you may by and by come to see will really never excel such an\nobject as this!\"\n\nWhen she had finished speaking, she handed it over to them, and after\nthey had passed it round for inspection, she again fastened it properly\non Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's neck, and also bade her brother go and hire a small\ncarriage, or engage a small chair, and escort Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc back home.\n\n\"If I see him back,\" Hua Tzu-fang remarked, \"there would be no harm,\nwere he even to ride his horse!\"\n\n\"It isn't because of harm,\" Hsi Jen replied; \"but because he may come\nacross some one from the house.\"\n\nHua Tzu-fang promptly went and bespoke a small chair; and when it came\nto the door, the whole party could not very well detain him, and they of\ncourse had to see Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc out of the house; while Hsi Jen, on the other\nhand, snatched a few fruits and gave them to Ming Yen; and as she at the\nsame time pressed in his hand several cash to buy crackers with to let\noff, she enjoined him not to tell any one as he himself would likewise\nincur blame.\n\nAs she uttered these words, she straightway escorted Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc as far as\noutside the door, from whence having seen him mount into the sedan\nchair, she dropped the curtain; whereupon Ming Yen and her brother, the\ntwo of them, led the horses and followed behind in his wake. Upon\nreaching the street where the Ning mansion was situated, Ming Yen told\nthe chair to halt, and said to Hua Tzu-fang, \"It's advisable that I\nshould again go, with Mr. Secundus, into the Eastern mansion, to show\nourselves before we can safely betake ourselves home; for if we don't,\npeople will suspect!\"\n\nHua Tzu-fang, upon hearing that there was good reason in what he said,\npromptly clasped Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc out of the chair and put him on the horse,\nwhereupon after Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc smilingly remarked: \"Excuse me for the trouble\nI've surely put you to,\" they forthwith entered again by the back gate;\nbut putting aside all details, we will now confine ourselves to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc.\n\nAfter he had walked out of the door, the several waiting-maids in his\napartments played and laughed with greater zest and with less restraint.\nSome there were who played at chess, others who threw the dice or had a\ngame of cards; and they covered the whole floor with the shells of\nmelon-seeds they were cracking, when dame Li, his nurse, happened to\ncome in, propping herself on a staff, to pay her respects and to see\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, and perceiving that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was not at home and that the\nservant-girls were only bent upon romping, she felt intensely disgusted.\n\"Since I've left this place,\" she therefore exclaimed with a sigh, \"and\ndon't often come here, you've become more and more unmannerly; while the\nother nurse does still less than ever venture to expostulate with you;\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc is like a candlestick eighty feet high, shedding light on others,\nand throwing none upon himself! All he knows is to look down upon people\nas being filthy; and yet this is his room and he allows you to put it\ntopsy-turvey, and to become more and more unmindful of decorum!\"\n\nThese servant-girls were well aware that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was not particular in\nthese respects, and that in the next place nurse Li, having pleaded old\nage, resigned her place and gone home, had nowadays no control over\nthem, so that they simply gave their minds to romping and joking, and\npaid no heed whatever to her. Nurse Li however still kept on asking\nabout Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"How much rice he now ate at one meal? and at what time he\nwent to sleep?\" to which questions, the servant-girls replied quite at\nrandom; some there being too who observed: \"What a dreadful despicable\nold thing she is!\"\n\n\"In this covered bowl,\" she continued to inquire, \"is cream, and why not\ngive it to me to eat?\" and having concluded these words, she took it up\nand there and then began eating it.\n\n\"Be quick, and leave it alone!\" a servant-girl expostulated, \"that, he\nsaid, was kept in order to be given to Hsi Jen; and on his return, when\nhe again gets into a huff, you, old lady, must, on your own motion,\nconfess to having eaten it, and not involve us in any way as to have to\nbear his resentment.\"\n\nNurse Li, at these words, felt both angry and ashamed. \"I can't\nbelieve,\" she forthwith remarked, \"that he has become so bad at heart!\nNot to speak of the milk I've had, I have, in fact every right to even\nsomething more expensive than this; for is it likely that he holds Hsi\nJen dearer than myself? It can't forsooth be that he doesn't bear in\nmind how that I've brought him up to be a big man, and how that he has\neaten my blood transformed into milk and grown up to this age! and will\nbe because I'm now having a bowl of milk of his be angry on that score!\nI shall, yes, eat it, and we'll see what he'll do! I don't know what you\npeople think of Hsi Jen, but she was a lowbred girl, whom I've with my\nown hands raised up! and what fine object indeed was she!\"\n\nAs she spoke, she flew into a temper, and taking the cream she drank the\nwhole of it.\n\n\"They don't know how to speak properly!\" another servant-girl interposed\nsarcastically, \"and it's no wonder that you, old lady, should get angry!\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc still sends you, venerable dame, presents as a proof of his\ngratitude, and is it possible that he will feel displeased for such a\nthing like this?\"\n\n\"You girls shouldn't also pretend to be artful flatterers to cajole me!\"\nnurse Li added; \"do you imagine that I'm not aware of the dismissal, the\nother day, of Hsi Hs\u00c3\u00bceh, on account of a cup of tea? and as it's clear\nenough that I've incurred blame, I'll come by and by and receive it!\"\n\nHaving said this, she went off in a dudgeon, but not a long interval\nelapsed before Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc returned, and gave orders to go and fetch Hsi Jen;\nand perceiving Ching Ling reclining on the bed perfectly still: \"I\npresume she's ill,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc felt constrained to inquire, \"or if she isn't\nill, she must have lost at cards.\"\n\n\"Not so!\" observed Chiu Wen; \"she had been a winner, but dame Li came in\nquite casually and muddled her so that she lost; and angry at this she\nrushed off to sleep.\"\n\n\"Don't place yourselves,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc smiled, \"on the same footing as nurse\nLi, and if you were to let her alone, everything will be all right.\"\n\nThese words were still on his lips when Hsi Jen arrived. After the\nmutual salutations, Hsi Jen went on to ask of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc: \"Where did you\nhave your repast? and what time did you come back?\" and to present\nlikewise, on behalf of her mother and sister, her compliments to all the\ngirls, who were her companions. In a short while, she changed her\ncostume and divested herself of her fineries, and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc bade them fetch\nthe cream.\n\n\"Nurse Li has eaten it,\" the servant-girls rejoined, and as Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was\non the point of making some remark Hsi Jen hastened to interfere,\nlaughing the while; \"Is it really this that you had kept for me? many\nthanks for the trouble; the other day, when I had some, I found it very\ntoothsome, but after I had partaken of it, I got a pain in the stomach,\nand was so much upset, that it was only after I had brought it all up\nthat I felt all right. So it's as well that she has had it, for, had it\nbeen kept here, it would have been wasted all for no use! What I fancy\nare dry chestnuts; and while you clean a few for me, I'll go and lay the\nbed!\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc upon hearing these words credited them as true, so that he\ndiscarded all thought of the cream and fetched the chestnuts, which he,\nwith his own hands, selected and pealed. Perceiving at the same time\nthat none of the party were present in the room, he put on a smile and\ninquired of Hsi Jen: \"Who were those persons dressed in red to day?\"\n\n\"They're my two cousins on my mother's side,\" Hsi Jen explained, and\nhearing this, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc sang their praise as he heaved a couple of sighs.\n\n\"What are you sighing for?\" Hsi Jen remarked. \"I know the secret reasons\nof your heart; it's I fancy because she isn't fit to wear red!\"\n\n\"It isn't that,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc protested smilingly, \"it isn't that; if such a\nperson as that isn't good enough to be dressed in red, who would\nforsooth presume to wear it? It's because I find her so really lovely!\nand if we could, after all, manage to get her into our family, how nice\nit would be then!\"\n\nHsi Jen gave a sardonic smile. \"That it's my own fate to be a slave\ndoesn't matter, but is it likely that the destiny of even my very\nrelatives could be to become one and all of them bond servants? But you\nshould certainly set your choice upon some really beautiful girl, for\nshe would in that case be good enough to enter your house.\"\n\n\"Here you are again with your touchiness!\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc eagerly exclaimed\nsmiling, \"if I said that she should come to our house, does it\nnecessarily imply that she should be a servant? and wouldn't it do were\nI to mention that she should come as a relative!\"\n\n\"That too couldn't exalt her to be a fit match for you!\" rejoined Hsi\nJen; but Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc being loth to continue the conversation, simply busied\nhimself with cleaning the chestnuts.\n\n\"How is it you utter not a word?\" Hsi Jen laughed; \"I expect it's\nbecause I just offended you by my inconsiderate talk! But if by and by\nyou have your purpose fixed on it, just spend a few ounces of silver to\npurchase them with, and bring them in and have done!\"\n\n\"How would you have one make any reply?\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc smilingly rejoined; \"all\nI did was to extol her charms; for she's really fit to have been born in\na deep hall and spacious court as this; and it isn't for such foul\nthings as myself and others to contrariwise spend our days in this\nplace!\"\n\n\"Though deprived of this good fortune,\" Hsi Jen explained, \"she's\nnevertheless also petted and indulged and the jewel of my maternal uncle\nand my aunt! She's now seventeen years of age, and everything in the way\nof trousseau has been got ready, and she's to get married next year.\"\n\nUpon hearing the two words \"get married,\" he could not repress himself\nfrom again ejaculating: \"Hai hai!\" but while he was in an unhappy frame\nof mind, he once more heard Hsi Jen remark as she heaved a sigh: \"Ever\nsince I've come here, we cousins haven't all these years been able to\nget to live together, and now that I'm about to return home, they, on\nthe other hand, will all be gone!\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, realising that there lurked in this remark some meaning or\nother, was suddenly so taken aback that dropping the chestnuts, he\ninquired: \"How is it that you now want to go back?\"\n\n\"I was present to-day,\" Hsi Jen explained, \"when mother and brother held\nconsultation together, and they bade me be patient for another year, and\nthat next year they'll come up and redeem me out of service!\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, at these words, felt the more distressed. \"Why do they want to\nredeem you?\" he consequently asked.\n\n\"This is a strange question!\" Hsi Jen retorted, \"for I can't really be\ntreated as if I were the issue born in this homestead of yours! All the\nmembers of my family are elsewhere, and there's only myself in this\nplace, so that how could I end my days here?\"\n\n\"If I don't let you go, it will verily be difficult for you to get\naway!\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc replied.\n\n\"There has never been such a principle of action!\" urged Hsi Jen; \"even\nin the imperial palace itself, there's a fixed rule, by which possibly\nevery certain number of years a selection (of those who have to go takes\nplace), and every certain number of years a new batch enters; and\nthere's no such practice as that of keeping people for ever; not to\nspeak of your own home.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc realised, after reflection, that she, in point of fact, was\nright, and he went on to observe: \"Should the old lady not give you your\nrelease, it will be impossible for you to get off.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't she release me?\" Hsi Jen questioned. \"Am I really so very\nextraordinary a person as to have perchance made such an impression upon\nher venerable ladyship and my lady that they will be positive in not\nletting me go? They may, in all likelihood, give my family some more\nounces of silver to keep me here; that possibly may come about. But, in\ntruth, I'm also a person of the most ordinary run, and there are many\nmore superior to me, yea very many! Ever since my youth up, I've been in\nher old ladyship's service; first by waiting upon Miss Shih for several\nyears, and recently by being in attendance upon you for another term of\nyears; and now that our people will come to redeem me, I should, as a\nmatter of right, be told to go. My idea is that even the very redemption\nmoney won't be accepted, and that they will display such grace as to let\nme go at once. And, as for being told that I can't be allowed to go as\nI'm so diligent in my service to you, that's a thing that can on no\naccount come about! My faithful attendance is an obligation of my\nduties, and is no exceptional service! and when I'm gone you'll again\nhave some other faithful attendant, and it isn't likely that when I'm no\nmore here, you'll find it impracticable to obtain one!\"\n\nAfter Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had listened to these various arguments, which proved the\nreasonableness of her going and the unreasonableness of any detention,\nhe felt his heart more than ever a prey to distress. \"In spite of all\nyou say,\" he therefore continued, \"the sole desire of my heart is to\ndetain you; and I have no doubt but that the old lady will speak to your\nmother about it; and if she were to give your mother ample money,\nshe'll, of course, not feel as if she could very well with any decency\ntake you home!\"\n\n\"My mother won't naturally have the audacity to be headstrong!\" Hsi Jen\nventured, \"not to speak besides of the nice things, which may be told\nher and the lots of money she may, in addition, be given; but were she\neven not to be paid any compliments, and not so much as a single cash\ngiven her, she won't, if you set your mind upon keeping me here, presume\nnot to comply with your wishes, were it also against my inclination. One\nthing however; our family would never rely upon prestige, and trust upon\nhonorability to do anything so domineering as this! for this isn't like\nanything else, which, because you take a fancy to it, a hundred per cent\nprofit can be added, and it obtained for you! This action can be well\ntaken if the seller doesn't suffer loss! But in the present instance,\nwere they to keep me back for no rhyme or reason, it would also be of no\nbenefit to yourself; on the contrary, they would be instrumental in\nkeeping us blood relatives far apart; a thing the like of which, I feel\npositive that dowager lady Chia and my lady will never do!\"\n\nAfter lending an ear to this argument, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc cogitated within himself\nfor a while. \"From what you say,\" he then observed, \"when you say you'll\ngo, it means that you'll go for certain!\"\n\n\"Yes, that I'll go for certain,\" Hsi Jen rejoined.\n\n\"Who would have anticipated,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, after these words, mused in his\nown heart, \"that a person like her would have shown such little sense of\ngratitude, and such a lack of respect! Had I,\" he then remarked aloud\nwith a sigh, \"been aware, at an early date, that your whole wish would\nhave been to go, I wouldn't, in that case, have brought you over! But\nwhen you're away, I shall remain alone, a solitary spirit!\"\n\nAs he spoke, he lost control over his temper, and, getting into bed, he\nwent to sleep.\n\nThe fact is that when Hsi Jen had been at home, and she heard her mother\nand brother express their intention of redeeming her back, she there and\nthen observed that were she even at the point of death, she would not\nreturn home. \"When in past days,\" she had argued, \"you had no rice to\neat, there remained myself, who was still worth several taels; and\nhadn't I urged you to sell me, wouldn't I have seen both father and\nmother die of starvation under my very eyes? and you've now had the good\nfortune of selling me into this place, where I'm fed and clothed just\nlike a mistress, and where I'm not beaten by day, nor abused by night!\nBesides, though now father be no more, you two have anyhow by putting\nthings straight again, so adjusted the family estate that it has resumed\nits primitive condition. And were you, in fact, still in straitened\ncircumstances, and you could by redeeming me back, make again some more\nmoney, that would be well and good; but the truth is that there's no\nsuch need, and what would be the use for you to redeem me at such a time\nas this? You should temporarily treat me as dead and gone, and shouldn't\nagain recall any idea of redeeming me!\"\n\nHaving in consequence indulged in a loud fit of crying, her mother and\nbrother resolved, when they perceived her in this determined frame of\nmind, that for a fact there was no need for her to come out of service.\nWhat is more they had sold her under contract until death, in the\ndistinct reliance that the Chia family, charitable and generous a family\nas it was, would, possibly, after no more than a few entreaties, make\nthem a present of her person as well as the purchase money. In the\nsecond place, never had they in the Chia mansion ill-used any of those\nbelow; there being always plenty of grace and little of imperiousness.\nBesides, the servant-girls, who acted as personal attendants in the\napartments of the old as well as of the young, were treated so far\nunlike the whole body of domestics in the household that the daughters\neven of an ordinary and penniless parentage could not have been so\nlooked up to. And these considerations induced both the mother as well\nas her son to at once dispel the intention and not to redeem her, and\nwhen Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had subsequently paid them an unexpected visit, and the two\nof them (Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc and Hsi Jen) were seen to be also on such terms, the\nmother and her son obtained a clearer insight into their relations, and\nstill one more burden (which had pressed on their mind) fell to the\nground, and as besides this was a contingency, which they had never\nreckoned upon, they both composed their hearts, and did not again\nentertain any idea of ransoming her.\n\nIt must be noticed moreover that Hsi Jen had ever since her youth not\nbeen blind to the fact that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had an extraordinary temperament,\nthat he was self-willed and perverse, far even in excess of all young\nlads, and that he had, in addition, a good many peculiarities and many\nunspeakable defects. And as of late he had placed such reliance in the\nfond love of his grandmother that his father and mother even could not\nexercise any extreme control over him, he had become so much the more\nremiss, dissolute, selfish and unconcerned, not taking the least\npleasure in what was proper, that she felt convinced, whenever she\nentertained the idea of tendering him advice, that he would not listen\nto her. On this day, by a strange coincidence, came about the discussion\nrespecting her ransom, and she designedly made use, in the first\ninstance, of deception with a view to ascertain his feelings, to\nsuppress his temper, and to be able subsequently to extend to him some\nwords of admonition; and when she perceived that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had now silently\ngone to sleep, she knew that his feelings could not brook the idea of\nher return and that his temper had already subsided. She had never had,\nas far as she was concerned, any desire of eating chestnuts, but as she\nfeared lest, on account of the cream, some trouble might arise, which\nmight again lead to the same results as when Hsi Hs\u00c3\u00bceh drank the tea,\nshe consequently made use of the pretence that she fancied chestnuts, in\norder to put off Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc from alluding (to the cream) and to bring the\nmatter speedily to an end. But telling forthwith the young waiting-maids\nto take the chestnuts away and eat them, she herself came and pushed\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc; but at the sight of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc with the traces of tears on his face,\nshe at once put on a smiling expression and said: \"What's there in this\nto wound your heart? If you positively do wish to keep me, I shall, of\ncourse, not go away!\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc noticed that these words contained some hidden purpose, and\nreadily observed: \"Do go on and tell me what else I can do to succeed in\nkeeping you here, for of my own self I find it indeed difficult to say\nhow!\"\n\n\"Of our friendliness all along,\" Hsi Jen smilingly rejoined, \"there's\nnaturally no need to speak; but, if you have this day made up your mind\nto retain me here, it isn't through this friendship that you'll succeed\nin doing so. But I'll go on and mention three distinct conditions, and,\nif you really do accede to my wishes, you'll then have shown an earnest\ndesire to keep me here, and I won't go, were even a sword to be laid on\nmy neck!\"\n\n\"Do tell me what these conditions are,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc pressed her with\nalacrity, as he smiled, \"and I'll assent to one and all. My dear sister,\nmy own dear sister, not to speak of two or three, but even two or three\nhundred of them I'm quite ready to accept. All I entreat you is that you\nand all of you should combine to watch over me and take care of me,\nuntil some day when I shall be transformed into flying ashes; but flying\nashes are, after all, not opportune, as they have form and substance and\nthey likewise possess sense, but until I've been metamorphosed into a\nstreak of subtle smoke. And when the wind shall have with one puff\ndispelled me, all of you then will be unable to attend to me, just as\nmuch as I myself won't be able to heed you. You will, when that time\ncomes, let me go where I please, as I'll let you speed where you choose\nto go!\"\n\nThese words so harassed Hsi Jen that she hastened to put her hand over\nhis mouth. \"Speak decently,\" she said; \"I was on account of this just\nabout to admonish you, and now here you are uttering all this still more\nloathsome trash.\"\n\n\"I won't utter these words again,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc eagerly added.\n\n\"This is the first fault that you must change,\" Hsi Jen replied.\n\n\"I'll amend,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc observed, \"and if I say anything of the kind again\nyou can wring my mouth; but what else is there?\"\n\n\"The second thing is this,\" Hsi Jen explained; \"whether you really like\nto study or whether you only pretend to like study is immaterial; but\nyou should, when you are in the presence of master, or in the presence\nof any one else, not do nothing else than find fault with people and\nmake fun of them, but behave just as if you were genuinely fond of\nstudy, so that you shouldn't besides provoke your father so much to\nanger, and that he should before others have also a chance of saying\nsomething! 'In my family,' he reflects within himself, 'generation after\ngeneration has been fond of books, but ever since I've had you, you\nhaven't accomplished my expectations, and not only is it that you don't\ncare about reading books,'--and this has already filled his heart with\nanger and vexation,--'but both before my face and behind my back, you\nutter all that stuff and nonsense, and give those persons, who have,\nthrough their knowledge of letters, attained high offices, the nickname\nof the \"the salaried worms.\" You also uphold that there's no work\nexclusive (of the book where appears) \"fathom spotless virtue;\" and that\nall other books consist of foolish compilations, which owe their origin\nto former authors, who, unable themselves to expound the writings of\nConfucius, readily struck a new line and invented original notions.' Now\nwith words like these, how can one wonder if master loses all patience,\nand if he does from time to time give you a thrashing! and what do you\nmake other people think of you?\"\n\n\"I won't say these things again,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc laughingly protested, \"these\nare the reckless and silly absurdities of a time when I was young and\nhad no idea of the height of the heavens and the thickness of the earth;\nbut I'll now no more repeat them. What else is there besides?\"\n\n\"It isn't right that you should sneer at the bonzes and vilify the\nTaoist priests, nor mix cosmetics or prepare rouge,\" Hsi Jen continued;\n\"but there's still another thing more important, you shouldn't again\nindulge the bad habits of licking the cosmetic, applied by people on\ntheir lips, nor be fond of (girls dressed) in red!\"\n\n\"I'll change in all this,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc added by way of rejoinder; \"I'll\nchange in all this; and if there's anything more be quick and tell me.\"\n\n\"There's nothing more,\" Hsi Jen observed; \"but you must in everything\nexercise a little more diligence, and not indulge your caprices and\nallow your wishes to run riot, and you'll be all right. And should you\ncomply to all these things in real earnest, you couldn't carry me out,\neven in a chair with eight bearers.\"\n\n\"Well, if you do stay in here long enough,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc remarked with a\nsmile, \"there's no fear as to your not having an eight-bearer-chair to\nsit in!\"\n\nHsi Jen gave a sardonic grin. \"I don't care much about it,\" she replied;\n\"and were I even to have such good fortune, I couldn't enjoy such a\nright. But allowing I could sit in one, there would be no pleasure in\nit!\"\n\nWhile these two were chatting, they saw Ch'iu Wen walk in. \"It's the\nthird watch of the night,\" she observed, \"and you should go to sleep.\nJust a few moments back your grandmother lady Chia and our lady sent a\nnurse to ask about you, and I replied that you were asleep.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc bade her fetch a watch, and upon looking at the time, he found\nindeed that the hand was pointing at ten; whereupon rinsing his mouth\nagain and loosening his clothes, he retired to rest, where we will leave\nhim without any further comment.\n\nThe next day, Hsi Jen got up as soon as it was dawn, feeling her body\nheavy, her head sore, her eyes swollen, and her limbs burning like fire.\nShe managed however at first to keep up, an effort though it was, but as\nsubsequently she was unable to endure the strain, and all she felt\ndisposed to do was to recline, she therefore lay down in her clothes on\nthe stove-couch. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc hastened to tell dowager lady Chia, and the\ndoctor was sent for, who, upon feeling her pulse and diagnosing her\ncomplaint, declared that there was nothing else the matter with her than\na chill, which she had suddenly contracted, that after she had taken a\ndose or two of medicine, it would be dispelled, and that she would be\nquite well. After he had written the prescription and taken his\ndeparture, some one was despatched to fetch the medicines, which when\nbrought were properly decocted. As soon as she had swallowed a dose,\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc bade her cover herself with her bed-clothes so as to bring on\nperspiration; while he himself came into Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc's room to look her up.\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc was at this time quite alone, reclining on her bed having a\nmidday siesta, and the waiting-maids having all gone out to attend to\nwhatever they pleased, the whole room was plunged in stillness and\nsilence. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc raised the embroidered soft thread portiere and walked\nin; and upon espying Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc in the room fast asleep, he hurriedly\napproached her and pushing her: \"Dear cousin,\" he said, \"you've just had\nyour meal, and are you asleep already?\" and he kept on calling \"Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc\"\ntill he woke her out of her sleep.\n\nPerceiving that it was Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"You had better go for a stroll,\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc\nurged, \"for the day before yesterday I was disturbed the whole night,\nand up to this day I haven't had rest enough to get over the fatigue. My\nwhole body feels languid and sore.\"\n\n\"This languor and soreness,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc rejoined, \"are of no consequence;\nbut if you go on sleeping you'll be feeling very ill; so I'll try and\ndistract you, and when we've dispelled this lassitude, you'll be all\nright.\"\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc closed her eyes. \"I don't feel any lassitude,\" she explained,\n\"all I want is a little rest; and you had better go elsewhere and come\nback after romping about for a while.\"\n\n\"Where can I go?\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc asked as he pushed her. \"I'm quite sick and\ntired of seeing the others.\"\n\nAt these words, Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc burst out laughing with a sound of Ch'ih. \"Well!\nsince you wish to remain here,\" she added, \"go over there and sit down\nquietly, and let's have a chat.\"\n\n\"I'll also recline,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc suggested.\n\n\"Well, then, recline!\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc assented.\n\n\"There's no pillow,\" observed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"so let us lie on the same\npillow.\"\n\n\"What nonsense!\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc urged, \"aren't those pillows outside? get one\nand lie on it.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc walked into the outer apartment, and having looked about him, he\nreturned and remarked with a smile: \"I don't want those, they may be,\nfor aught I know, some dirty old hag's.\"\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc at this remark opened her eyes wide, and as she raised herself\nup: \"You're really,\" she exclaimed laughingly, \"the evil star of my\nexistence! here, please recline on this pillow!\" and as she uttered\nthese words, she pushed her own pillow towards Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, and, getting up\nshe went and fetched another of her own, upon which she lay her head in\nsuch a way that both of them then reclined opposite to each other. But\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc, upon turning up her eyes and looking, espied on Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's cheek\non the left side of his face, a spot of blood about the size of a\nbutton, and speedily bending her body, she drew near to him, and rubbing\nit with her hand, she scrutinised it closely. \"Whose nail,\" she went on\nto inquire, \"has scratched this open?\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc with his body still reclining withdrew from her reach, and as he\ndid so, he answered with a smile: \"It isn't a scratch; it must, I\npresume, be simply a drop, which bespattered my cheek when I was just\nnow mixing and clarifying the cosmetic paste for them.\"\n\nSaying this, he tried to get at his handkerchief to wipe it off; but\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc used her own and rubbed it clean for him, while she observed: \"Do\nyou still give your mind to such things? attend to them you may; but\nmust you carry about you a placard (to make it public)? Though uncle\nmayn't see it, were others to notice it, they would treat it as a\nstrange occurrence and a novel bit of news, and go and tell him to curry\nfavour, and when it has reached uncle's ear, we shall all again not come\nout clean, and provoke him to anger.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc did not in the least heed what she said, being intent upon\nsmelling a subtle scent which, in point of fact, emanated from Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc's\nsleeve, and when inhaled inebriated the soul and paralysed the bones.\nWith a snatch, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc laid hold of Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc's sleeve meaning to see what\nobject was concealed in it; but Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc smilingly expostulated: \"At such\na time as this,\" she said, \"who keeps scents about one?\"\n\n\"Well, in that case,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc rejoined with a smirking face, \"where does\nthis scent come from?\"\n\n\"I myself don't know,\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc replied; \"I presume it must be, there's no\nsaying, some scent in the press which has impregnated the clothes.\"\n\n\"It doesn't follow,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc added, as he shook his head; \"the fumes of\nthis smell are very peculiar, and don't resemble the perfume of\nscent-bottles, scent-balls, or scented satchets!\"\n\n\"Is it likely that I have, like others, Buddhistic disciples,\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc\nasked laughing ironically, \"or worthies to give me novel kinds of\nscents? But supposing there is about me some peculiar scent, I haven't,\nat all events, any older or younger brothers to get the flowers, buds,\ndew, and snow, and concoct any for me; all I have are those common\nscents, that's all.\"\n\n\"Whenever I utter any single remark,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc urged with a grin, \"you at\nonce bring up all these insinuations; but unless I deal with you\nseverely, you'll never know what stuff I'm made of; but from henceforth\nI'll no more show you any grace!\"\n\nAs he spoke, he turned himself over, and raising himself, he puffed a\ncouple of breaths into both his hands, and hastily stretching them out,\nhe tickled Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc promiscuously under her armpits, and along both sides.\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc had never been able to stand tickling, so that when Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc put\nout his two hands and tickled her violently, she forthwith giggled to\nsuch an extent that she could scarcely gasp for breath. \"If you still go\non teasing me,\" she shouted, \"I'll get angry with you!\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc then kept his hands off, and as he laughed, \"Tell me,\" he asked,\n\"will you again come out with all those words or not?\"\n\n\"I daren't do it again,\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc smiled and adjusted her hair; adding\nwith another laugh: \"I may have peculiar scents, but have you any 'warm'\nscents?\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc at this question, could not for a time unfold its meaning: \"What\n'warm' scent?\" he therefore asked.\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc nodded her head and smiled deridingly. \"How stupid! what a fool!\"\nshe sighed; \"you have jade, and another person has gold to match with\nyou, and if some one has 'cold' scent, haven't you any 'warm' scent as a\nset-off?\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc at this stage alone understood the import of her remark.\n\n\"A short while back you craved for mercy,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc observed smilingly,\n\"and here you are now going on talking worse than ever;\" and as he spoke\nhe again put out his hands.\n\n\"Dear cousin,\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc speedily implored with a smirk, \"I won't venture\nto do it again.\"\n\n\"As for letting you off,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc remarked laughing, \"I'll readily let\nyou off, but do allow me to take your sleeve and smell it!\" and while\nuttering these words, he hastily pulled the sleeve, and pressing it\nagainst his face, kept on smelling it incessantly, whereupon Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc drew\nher hand away and urged: \"You must be going now!\"\n\n\"Though you may wish me to go, I can't,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc smiled, \"so let us now\nlie down with all propriety and have a chat,\" laying himself down again,\nas he spoke, while Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc likewise reclined, and covered her face with\nher handkerchief. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc in a rambling way gave vent to a lot of\nnonsense, which Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc did not heed, and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc went on to inquire: \"How\nold she was when she came to the capital? what sights and antiquities\nshe saw on the journey? what relics and curiosities there were at Yang\nChou? what were the local customs and the habits of the people?\"\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc made no reply; and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc fearing lest she should go to sleep,\nand get ill, readily set to work to beguile her to keep awake. \"Ai yah!\"\nhe exclaimed, \"at Yang Chou, where your official residence is, has\noccurred a remarkable affair; have you heard about it?\"\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc perceiving that he spoke in earnest, that his words were correct\nand his face serious, imagined that what he referred to was a true\nstory, and she therefore inquired what it was?\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc upon hearing her ask this question, forthwith suppressed a laugh,\nand, with a glib tongue, he began to spin a yarn. \"At Yang Chou,\" he\nsaid, \"there's a hill called the Tai hill; and on this hill stands a\ncave called the Lin Tzu.\"\n\n\"This must all be lies,\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc answered sneeringly, \"as I've never\nbefore heard of such a hill.\"\n\n\"Under the heavens many are the hills and rivers,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc rejoined, \"and\nhow could you know them all? Wait until I've done speaking, when you\nwill be free to express your opinion!\"\n\n\"Go on then,\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc suggested, whereupon Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc prosecuted his\nraillery. \"In this Lin Tzu cave,\" he said, \"there was once upon a time a\nwhole swarm of rat-elves. In some year or other and on the seventh day\nof the twelfth moon, an old rat ascended the throne to discuss matters.\n'Tomorrow,' he argued, 'is the eighth of the twelfth moon, and men in\nthe world will all be cooking the congee of the eighth of the twelfth\nmoon. We have now in our cave a short supply of fruits of all kinds, and\nit would be well that we should seize this opportunity to steal a few\nand bring them over.' Drawing a mandatory arrow, he handed it to a\nsmall rat, full of aptitude, to go forward on a tour of inspection. The\nyoung rat on his return reported that he had already concluded his\nsearch and inquiries in every place and corner, and that in the temple\nat the bottom of the hill alone was the largest stock of fruits and\nrice. 'How many kinds of rice are there?' the old rat ascertained, 'and\nhow many species of fruits?' 'Rice and beans,' the young rat rejoined,\n'how many barns-full there are, I can't remember; but in the way of\nfruits there are five kinds: 1st, red dates; 2nd, chestnuts; 3rd, ground\nnuts; 4th, water caltrops, and 5th, scented taros.' At this report the\nold rat was so much elated that he promptly detailed rats to go forth;\nand as he drew the mandatory arrow, and inquired who would go and steal\nthe rice, a rat readily received the order and went off to rob the rice.\nDrawing another mandatory arrow, he asked who would go and abstract the\nbeans, when once more a rat took over the arrow and started to steal the\nbeans; and one by one subsequently received each an arrow and started on\nhis errand. There only remained the scented taros, so that picking again\na mandatory arrow, he ascertained who would go and carry away the taros:\nwhereupon a very puny and very delicate rat was heard to assent. 'I\nwould like,' he said, 'to go and steal the scented taros.' The old rat\nand all the swarm of rats, upon noticing his state, feared that he would\nnot be sufficiently expert, and apprehending at the same time that he\nwas too weakly and too devoid of energy, they one and all would not\nallow him to proceed. 'Though I be young in years and though my frame be\ndelicate,' the wee rat expostulated, 'my devices are unlimited, my talk\nis glib and my designs deep and farseeing; and I feel convinced that, on\nthis errand, I shall be more ingenious in pilfering than any of them.'\n'How could you be more ingenious than they?' the whole company of rats\nasked. 'I won't,' explained the young rat, 'follow their example, and go\nstraight to work and steal, but by simply shaking my body, and\ntransforming myself, I shall metamorphose myself into a taro, and roll\nmyself among the heap of taros, so that people will not be able to\ndetect me, and to hear me; whereupon I shall stealthily, by means of the\nmagic art of dividing my body into many, begin the removal, and little\nby little transfer the whole lot away, and will not this be far more\ningenious than any direct pilfering or forcible abstraction?' After the\nwhole swarm of rats had listened to what he had to say, they, with one\nvoice, exclaimed: 'Excellent it is indeed, but what is this art of\nmetamorphosis we wonder? Go forth you may, but first transform yourself\nand let us see you.' At these words the young rat laughed. 'This isn't a\nhard task!' he observed, 'wait till I transform myself.'\n\n\"Having done speaking, he shook his body and shouted out 'transform,'\nwhen he was converted into a young girl, most beauteous and with a most\nlovely face.\n\n\"'You've transformed yourself into the wrong thing,' all the rats\npromptly added deridingly; 'you said that you were to become a fruit,\nand how is it that you've turned into a young lady?'\n\n\"The young rat in its original form rejoined with a sneering smile: 'You\nall lack, I maintain, experience of the world; what you simply are aware\nof is that this fruit is the scented taro, but have no idea that the\nyoung daughter of Mr. Lin, of the salt tax, is, in real truth, a genuine\nscented taro.'\"\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc having listened to this story, turned herself round and raising\nherself, she observed laughing, while she pushed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc: \"I'll take that\nmouth of yours and pull it to pieces! Now I see that you've been\nimposing upon me.\"\n\nWith these words on her lips, she readily gave him a pinch, and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\nhastened to plead for mercy. \"My dear cousin,\" he said, \"spare me; I\nwon't presume to do it again; and it's when I came to perceive this\nperfume of yours, that I suddenly bethought myself of this old story.\"\n\n\"You freely indulge in abusing people,\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc added with a smile, \"and\nthen go on to say that it's an old story.\"\n\nBut hardly had she concluded this remark before they caught sight of\nPao-ch'ai walk in. \"Who has been telling old stories?\" she asked with a\nbeaming face; \"do let me also hear them.\"\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc pressed her at once into a seat. \"Just see for yourself who else\nbesides is here!\" she smiled; \"he goes in for profuse abuses and then\nmaintains that it's an old story!\"\n\n\"Is it indeed cousin Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc?\" Pao-ch'ai remarked. \"Well, one can't feel\nsurprised at his doing it; for many have ever been the stories stored up\nin his brain. The only pity is that when he should make use of old\nstories, he invariably forgets them! To-day, he can easily enough recall\nthem to mind, but in the stanza of the other night on the banana leaves,\nwhen he should have remembered them, he couldn't after all recollect\nwhat really stared him in the face! and while every one else seemed so\ncool, he was in such a flurry that he actually perspired! And yet, at\nthis moment, he happens once again to have a memory!\"\n\nAt these words, Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc laughed. \"O-mi-to-fu!\" she exclaimed. \"You are\nindeed my very good cousin! But you've also (to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc) come across your\nmatch. And this makes it clear that requital and retribution never fail\nor err.\"\n\nShe had just reached this part of her sentence, when in Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's rooms\nwas heard a continuous sound of wrangling; but as what transpired is not\nyet known, the ensuing chapter will explain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\n  Wang Hsi-feng with earnest words upbraids Mrs. Chao's jealous notions.\n  Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc uses specious language to make sport of Shih Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn's\n      querulous tone of voice.\n\n\nBut to continue. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was in Tai y\u00c3\u00bc's apartments relating about the\nrat-elves, when Pao-ch'ai entered unannounced, and began to gibe Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc,\nwith trenchant irony: how that on the fifteenth of the first moon, he\nhad shown ignorance of the allusion to the green wax; and the three of\nthem then indulged in that room in mutual poignant satire, for the sake\nof fun. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had been giving way to solicitude lest Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc should, by\nbeing bent upon napping soon after her meal, be shortly getting an\nindigestion, or lest sleep should, at night, be completely dispelled, as\nneither of these things were conducive to the preservation of good\nhealth, when luckily Pao-ch'ai walked in, and they chatted and laughed\ntogether; and when Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc at length lost all inclination to dose, he\nhimself then felt composed in his mind. But suddenly they heard\nclamouring begin in his room, and after they had all lent an ear and\nlistened, Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc was the first to smile and make a remark. \"It's\nyour nurse having a row with Hsi Jen!\" she said. \"Hsi Jen treats her\nwell enough, but that nurse of yours would also like to keep her well\nunder her thumb; she's indeed an old dotard;\" and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was anxious to\ngo over at once, but Pao-ch'ai laid hold of him and kept him back,\nsuggesting: \"It's as well that you shouldn't wrangle with your nurse,\nfor she's quite stupid from old age; and it's but fair, on the contrary,\nthat you should bear with her a little.\"\n\n\"I know all about that!\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc rejoined. But having concluded this\nremark, he walked into his room, where he discovered nurse Li, leaning\non her staff, standing in the centre of the floor, abusing Hsi Jen,\nsaying: \"You young wench! how utterly unmindful you are of your origin!\nIt's I who've raised you up, and yet, when I came just now, you put on\nhigh airs and mighty side, and remained reclining on the stove-couch!\nYou saw me well enough, but you paid not the least heed to me! Your\nwhole heart is set upon acting like a wily enchantress to befool Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc;\nand you so impose upon Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc that he doesn't notice me, but merely\nlends an ear to what you people have to say! You're no more than a low\ngirl bought for a few taels and brought in here; and will it ever do\nthat you should be up to your mischievous tricks in this room? But\nwhether you like it or not, I'll drag you out from this, and give you to\nsome mean fellow, and we'll see whether you will still behave like a\nvery imp, and cajole people or not?\"\n\nHsi Jen was, at first, under the simple impression that the nurse was\nwrath for no other reason than because she remained lying down, and she\nfelt constrained to explain that \"she was unwell, that she had just\nsucceeded in perspiring, and that having had her head covered, she\nhadn't really perceived the old lady;\" but when she came subsequently to\nhear her mention that she imposed upon Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, and also go so far as to\nadd that she would be given to some mean fellow, she unavoidably\nexperienced both a sense of shame and injury, and found it impossible to\nrestrain herself from beginning to cry.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc had, it is true, caught all that had been said, but unable with\nany propriety to take notice of it, he thought it his duty to explain\nmatters for her. \"She's ill,\" he observed, \"and is taking medicines; and\nif you don't believe it,\" he went on, \"well then ask the rest of the\nservant-girls.\"\n\nNurse Li at these words flew into a more violent dudgeon. \"Your sole\ndelight is to screen that lot of sly foxes!\" she remarked, \"and do you\npay any notice to me? No, none at all! and whom would you like me to go\nand ask; who's it that doesn't back you? and who hasn't been dismounted\nfrom her horse by Hsi Jen? I know all about it; but I'll go with you and\nexplain all these matters to our old mistress and my lady; for I've\nnursed you till I've brought you to this age, and now that you don't\nfeed on milk, you thrust me on one side, and avail yourself of the\nservant-girls, in your wish to browbeat me.\"\n\nAs she uttered this remark, she too gave way to tears, but by this time,\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc and Pao-ch'ai had also come over, and they set to work to\nreassure her. \"You, old lady,\" they urged, \"should bear with them a\nlittle, and everything will be right!\" And when nurse Li saw these two\narrive, she hastened to lay bare her grievances to them; and taking up\nthe question of the dismissal in days gone by, of Hsi Hs\u00c3\u00bceh, for having\ndrunk some tea, of the cream eaten on the previous day, and other\nsimilar matters, she spun a long, interminable yarn.\n\nBy a strange coincidence lady Feng was at this moment in the upper\nrooms, where she had been making up the account of losses and winnings,\nand upon hearing at the back a continuous sound of shouting and\nbustling, she readily concluded that nurse Li's old complaint was\nbreaking forth, and that she was finding fault with Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's servants.\nBut she had, as luck would have it, lost money in gambling on this\noccasion, so that she was ready to visit her resentment upon others.\nWith hurried step, she forthwith came over, and laying hold of nurse Li,\n\"Nurse,\" she said smiling, \"don't lose your temper, on a great festival\nlike this, and after our venerable lady has just gone through a day in\nexcellent spirits! You're an old dame, and should, when others get up a\nrow, still do what is right and keep them in proper order; and aren't\nyou, instead of that, aware what good manners imply, that you will start\nvociferating in this place, and make our dowager lady full of\ndispleasure? Tell me who's not good, and I'll beat her for you; but be\nquick and come along with me over to my quarters, where a pheasant which\nthey have roasted is scalding hot, and let us go and have a glass of\nwine!\" And as she spoke, she dragged her along and went on her way.\n\"Feng Erh,\" she also called, \"hold the staff for your old lady Li, and\nthe handkerchief to wipe her tears with!\" While nurse Li walked along\nwith lady Feng, her feet scarcely touched the ground, as she kept on\nsaying: \"I don't really attach any value to this decrepid existence of\nmine! and I had rather disregard good manners, have a row and lose face,\nas it's better, it seems to me, than to put up with the temper of that\nwench!\"\n\nBehind followed Pao-ch'ai and Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, and at the sight of the way in\nwhich lady Feng dealt with her, they both clapped their hands, and\nexclaimed, laughing, \"What piece of luck that this gust of wind has\ncome, and dragged away this old matron!\" while Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc nodded his head to\nand fro and soliloquised with a sigh: \"One can neither know whence\noriginates this score; for she will choose the weak one to maltreat; nor\ncan one see what girl has given her offence that she has come to be put\nin her black books!\"\n\nScarcely had he ended this remark, before Ch'ing Wen, who stood by, put\nin her word. \"Who's gone mad again?\" she interposed, \"and what good\nwould come by hurting her feelings? But did even any one happen to hurt\nher, she would have pluck enough to bear the brunt, and wouldn't act so\nimproperly as to involve others!\"\n\nHsi Jen wept, and as she, did so, she drew Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc towards her: \"All\nthrough my having aggrieved an old nurse,\" she urged, \"you've now again\ngiven umbrage, entirely on my account, to this crowd of people; and\nisn't this still enough for me to bear but must you also go and drag in\nthird parties?\"\n\nWhen Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc realised that to this sickness of hers, had also been\nsuperadded all these annoyances, he promptly stifled his resentment,\nsuppressed his voice and consoled her so far as to induce her to lie\ndown again to perspire. And when he further noticed how scalding like\nsoup and burning like fire she was, he himself watched by her, and\nreclining by her side, he tried to cheer her, saying: \"All you must do\nis to take good care of your ailment; and don't give your mind to those\ntrifling matters, and get angry.\"\n\n\"Were I,\" Hsi Jen smiled sardonically, \"to lose my temper over such\nconcerns, would I be able to stand one moment longer in this room? The\nonly thing is that if she goes on, day after day, doing nothing else\nthan clamour in this manner, how can she let people get along? But you\nrashly go and hurt people's feelings for our sakes; but they'll bear it\nin mind, and when they find an opportunity, they'll come out with what's\neasy enough to say, but what's not pleasant to hear, and how will we all\nfeel then?\"\n\nWhile her mouth gave utterance to these words, she could not stop her\ntears from running; but fearful, on the other hand, lest Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc should\nbe annoyed, she felt compelled to again strain every nerve to repress\nthem. But in a short while, the old matrons employed for all sorts of\nduties, brought in some mixture of two drugs; and, as Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc noticed\nthat she was just on the point of perspiring, he did not allow her to\nget up, but readily taking it up to her, she immediately swallowed it,\nwith her head still on her pillow; whereupon he gave speedy directions\nto the young servant-maids to lay her stove-couch in order.\n\n\"Whether you mean to have anything to eat or not,\" Hsi Jen advised, \"you\nshould after all sit for a time with our old mistress and our lady, and\nhave a romp with the young ladies; after which you can come back again;\nwhile I, by quietly keeping lying down, will also feel the better.\"\n\nWhen Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc heard this suggestion, he had no help but to accede, and,\nafter she had divested herself of her hair-pins and earrings, and he saw\nher lie down, he betook himself into the drawing-rooms, where he had his\nrepast with old lady Chia. But the meal over, her ladyship felt still\ndisposed to play at cards with the nurses, who had looked after the\nhousehold for many years; and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, bethinking himself of Hsi Jen,\nhastened to return to his apartments; where seeing that Hsi Jen was\ndrowsily falling asleep, he himself would have wished to go to bed, but\nthe hour was yet early. And as about this time Ch'ing Wen, I Hsia, Ch'in\nWen, Pi Hen had all, in their desire of getting some excitement, started\nin search of Y\u00c3\u00bcan Yang, Hu Po and their companions, to have a romp with\nthem, and he espied She Y\u00c3\u00bceh alone in the outer room, having a game of\ndominoes by lamp-light, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc inquired full of smiles: \"How is it you\ndon't go with them?\"\n\n\"I've no money,\" She Y\u00c3\u00bceh replied.\n\n\"Under the bed,\" continued Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"is heaped up all that money, and\nisn't it enough yet for you to lose from?\"\n\n\"Had we all gone to play,\" She Y\u00c3\u00bceh added, \"to whom would the charge of\nthis apartment have been handed over? That other one is sick again, and\nthe whole room is above, one mass of lamps, and below, full of fire; and\nall those old matrons, ancient as the heavens, should, after all their\nexertions in waiting upon you from morning to night, be also allowed\nsome rest; while the young servant girls, on the other hand, have\nlikewise been on duty the whole day long, and shouldn't they even at\nthis hour be left to go and have some distraction? and that's why I am\nin here on watch.\"\n\nWhen Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc heard these words, which demonstrated distinctly that she\nwas another Hsi Jen, he consequently put on a smile and remarked: \"I'll\nsit in here, so you had better set your mind at ease and go!\"\n\n\"Since you remain in here, there's less need for me to go,\" resumed She\nY\u00c3\u00bceh, \"for we two can chat and play and laugh; and won't that be nice?\"\n\n\"What can we two do? it will be awfully dull! but never mind,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\nrejoined; \"this morning you said that your head itched, and now that you\nhave nothing to do, I may as well comb it for you.\"\n\n\"Yes! do so!\" readily assented She Y\u00c3\u00bceh, upon catching what he\nsuggested; and while still speaking, she brought over the dressing-case\ncontaining a set of small drawers and looking-glass, and taking off her\nornaments, she dishevelled her hair; whereupon Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc picked up the fine\ncomb and passed it repeatedly through her hair; but he had only combed\nit three or five times, when he perceived Ch'ing Wen hurriedly walk in\nto fetch some money. As soon as she caught sight of them both: \"You\nhaven't as yet drunk from the marriage cup,\" she said with a smile full\nof irony, \"and have you already put up your hair?\"\n\n\"Now that you've come, let me also comb yours for you,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\ncontinued.\n\n\"I'm not blessed with such excessive good fortune!\" Ch'ing Wen retorted,\nand as she uttered these words, she took the money, and forthwith\ndashing the portiere after her, she quitted the room.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc stood at the back of She Y\u00c3\u00bceh, and She Y\u00c3\u00bceh sat opposite the\nglass, so that the two of them faced each other in it, and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\nreadily observed as he gazed in the glass, \"In the whole number of rooms\nshe's the only one who has a glib tongue!\"\n\nShe Y\u00c3\u00bceh at these words hastily waved her hand towards the inside of the\nglass, and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc understood the hint; and suddenly a sound of \"hu\" was\nheard from the portiere, and Ch'ing Wen ran in once again.\n\n\"How have I got a glib tongue?\" she inquired; \"it would be well for us\nto explain ourselves.\"\n\n\"Go after your business, and have done,\" She Y\u00c3\u00bceh interposed laughingly;\n\"what's the use of your coming and asking questions of people?\"\n\n\"Will you also screen him?\" Ch'ing Wen smiled significantly; \"I know all\nabout your secret doings, but wait until I've got back my capital, and\nwe'll then talk matters over!\"\n\nWith this remark still on her lips, she straightway quitted the room,\nand during this while, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc having finished combing her hair, asked\nShe Y\u00c3\u00bceh to quietly wait upon him, while he went to sleep, as he would\nnot like to disturb Hsi Jen.\n\nOf the whole night there is nothing to record. But the next day, when he\ngot up at early dawn, Hsi Jen had already perspired, during the night,\nso that she felt considerably lighter and better; but limiting her diet\nto a little rice soup, she remained quiet and nursed herself, and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\nwas so relieved in mind that he came, after his meal, over on this side\nto his aunt Hs\u00c3\u00bceh's on a saunter. The season was the course of the first\nmoon, and the school was shut up for the new year holidays; while in the\ninner chambers the girls had put by their needlework, and were all\nhaving a time of leisure, and hence it was that when Chia Huan too came\nover in search of distraction, he discovered Pao-ch'ai, Hsiang Ling,\nYing Erh, the three of them, in the act of recreating themselves by\nplaying at chess. Chia Huan, at the sight of them, also wished to join\nin their games; and Pao-ch'ai, who had always looked upon him with, in\nfact, the same eye as she did Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, and with no different sentiment of\nany kind, pressed him to come up, upon hearing that he was on this\noccasion desirous to play; and, when he had seated himself together with\nthem, they began to gamble, staking each time a pile of ten cash. The\nfirst time, he was the winner, and he felt supremely elated at heart,\nbut as it happened that he subsequently lost in several consecutive\ngames he soon became a prey to considerable distress. But in due course\ncame the game in which it was his turn to cast the dice, and, if in\nthrowing, he got seven spots, he stood to win, but he was likewise bound\nto be a winner were he to turn up six; and when Ying Erh had turned up\nthree spots and lost, he consequently took up the dice, and dashing them\nwith spite, one of them settled at five; and, as the other reeled wildly\nabout, Ying Erh clapped her hands, and kept on shouting, \"one spot;\"\nwhile Chia Huan at once gazed with fixed eye and cried at random: \"It's\nsix, it's seven, it's eight!\" But the dice, as it happened, turned up at\none spot, and Chia Huan was so exasperated that putting out his hand, he\nspeedily made a snatch at the dice, and eventually was about to lay hold\nof the money, arguing that it was six spot. But Ying Erh expostulated,\n\"It was distinctly an ace,\" she said. And as Pao-ch'ai noticed how\ndistressed Chia Huan was, she forthwith cast a glance at Ying Erh and\nobserved: \"The older you get, the less manners you have! Is it likely\nthat gentlemen will cheat you? and don't you yet put down the money?\"\n\nYing Erh felt her whole heart much aggrieved, but as she heard Pao-ch'ai\nmake these remarks, she did not presume to utter a sound, and as she was\nunder the necessity of laying down the cash, she muttered to herself:\n\"This one calls himself a gentleman, and yet cheats us of these few\ncash, for which I myself even have no eye! The other day when I played\nwith Mr. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, he lost ever so many, and yet he did not distress\nhimself! and what remained of the cash were besides snatched away by a\nfew servant-girls, but all he did was to smile, that's all!\"\n\nPao-ch'ai did not allow her time to complete what she had to say, but\nthere and then called her to account and made her desist; whereupon Chia\nHuan exclaimed: \"How can I compare with Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc; you all fear him, and\nkeep on good terms with him, while you all look down upon me for not\nbeing the child of my lady.\" And as he uttered these words, he at once\ngave way to tears.\n\n\"My dear cousin,\" Pao-ch'ai hastened to advise him, \"leave off at once\nlanguage of this kind, for people will laugh at you;\" and then went on\nto scold Ying Erh, when Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc just happened to come in. Perceiving him\nin this plight, \"What is the matter?\" he asked; but Chia Huan had not\nthe courage to say anything.\n\nPao-ch'ai was well aware of the custom, which prevailed in their family,\nthat younger brothers lived in respect of the elder brothers, but she\nwas not however cognisant of the fact that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc would not that any one\nshould entertain any fear of him. His idea being that elder as well as\nyounger brothers had, all alike, father and mother to admonish them, and\nthat there was no need for any of that officiousness, which, instead of\ndoing good gave, on the contrary, rise to estrangement. \"Besides,\" (he\nreasoned,) \"I'm the offspring of the primary wife, while he's the son of\nthe secondary wife, and, if by treating him as leniently as I have done,\nthere are still those to talk about me, behind my back, how could I\nexercise any control over him?\" But besides these, there were other\nstill more foolish notions, which he fostered in his mind; but what\nfoolish notions they were can you, reader, guess? As a result of his\ngrowing up, from his early youth, among a crowd of girls, of whom, in\nthe way of sister, there was Y\u00c3\u00bcan Ch'un, of cousins, from his paternal\nuncle's side, there were Ying Ch'un, and Hsi Ch'un, and of relatives\nalso there were Shih Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn, Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, Hs\u00c3\u00bceh Pao-ch'ai and the\nrest, he, in due course, resolved in his mind that the divine and\nunsullied virtue of Heaven and earth was only implanted in womankind,\nand that men were no more than feculent dregs and foul dirt. And for\nthis reason it was that men were without discrimination, considered by\nhim as so many filthy objects, which might or might not exist; while the\nrelationships of father, paternal uncles, and brothers, he did not\nhowever presume to disregard, as these were among the injunctions\nbequeathed by the holy man, and he felt bound to listen to a few of\ntheir precepts. But to the above causes must be assigned the fact that,\namong his brothers, he did no more than accomplish the general purport\nof the principle of human affections; bearing in mind no thought\nwhatever that he himself was a human being of the male sex, and that it\nwas his duty to be an example to his younger brothers. And this is why\nChia Huan and the others entertained no respect for him, though in their\nveneration for dowager lady Chia, they yielded to him to a certain\ndegree.\n\nPao-ch'ai harboured fears lest, on this occasion, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc should call him\nto book, and put him out of face, and she there and then lost no time in\ntaking Chia Huan's part with a view to screening him.\n\n\"In this felicitous first moon what are you blubbering for?\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\ninquired, \"if this place isn't nice, why then go somewhere else to play.\nBut from reading books, day after day, you've studied so much that\nyou've become quite a dunce. If this thing, for instance, isn't good,\nthat must, of course, be good, so then discard this and take up that,\nbut is it likely that by sticking to this thing and crying for a while\nthat it will become good? You came originally with the idea of reaping\nsome fun, and you've instead provoked yourself to displeasure, and isn't\nit better then that you should be off at once.\"\n\nChia Huan upon hearing these words could not but come back to his\nquarters; and Mrs. Chao noticing the frame of mind in which he was felt\nconstrained to inquire: \"Where is it that you've been looked down upon\nby being made to fill up a hole, and being trodden under foot?\"\n\n\"I was playing with cousin Pao-ch'ai,\" Chia Huan readily replied, \"when\nYing Erh insulted me, and deprived me of my money, and brother Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\ndrove me away.\"\n\n\"Ts'ui!\" exclaimed Mrs. Chao, \"who bade you (presume so high) as to get\nup into that lofty tray? You low and barefaced thing! What place is\nthere that you can't go to and play; and who told you to run over there\nand bring upon yourself all this shame?\"\n\nAs she spoke, lady Feng was, by a strange coincidence, passing outside\nunder the window; so that every word reached her ear, and she speedily\nasked from outside the window: \"What are you up to in this happy first\nmoon? These brothers are, really, but mere children, and will you just\nfor a slight mistake, go on preaching to him! what's the use of coming\nout with all you've said? Let him go wherever he pleases; for there are\nstill our lady and Mr. Chia Cheng to keep him in order. But you go and\nsputter him with your gigantic mouth; he's at present a master, and if\nthere be anything wrong about him, there are, after all, those to rate\nhim; and what business is that of yours? Brother Huan, come out with\nyou, and follow me and let us go and enjoy ourselves.\"\n\nChia Huan had ever been in greater fear and trembling of lady Feng, than\nof madame Wang, so that when her summons reached his ear, he hurriedly\nwent out, while Mrs. Chao, on the other hand, did not venture to breathe\na single word.\n\n\"You too,\" resumed lady Feng, addressing Chia Huan; \"are a thing devoid\nof all natural spirit! I've often told you that if you want to eat,\ndrink, play, or laugh, you were quite free to go and play with whatever\nfemale cousin, male cousin, or sister-in-law you choose to disport\nyourself with; but you won't listen to my words. On the contrary, you\nlet all these persons teach you to be depraved in your heart, perverse\nin your mind, to be sly, artful, and domineering; and you've, besides,\nno respect for your own self, but will go with that low-bred lot! and\nyour perverse purpose is to begrudge people's preferences! But what\nyou've lost are simply a few cash, and do you behave in this manner? How\nmuch did you lose?\" she proceeded to ask Chia Huan; and Chia Huan, upon\nhearing this question, felt constrained to obey, by saying something in\nthe way of a reply. \"I've lost,\" he explained, \"some hundred or two\nhundred cash.\"\n\n\"You have,\" rejoined lady Feng, \"the good fortune of being a gentleman,\nand do you make such a fuss for the loss of a hundred or two hundred\ncash!\" and turning her head round, \"Feng Erh,\" she added, \"go and fetch\na thousand cash; and as the girls are all playing at the back, take him\nalong to go and play. And if again by and by, you're so mean and\ndeceitful, I shall, first of all, beat you, and then tell some one to\nreport it at school, and won't your skin be flayed for you? All because\nof this want of respect of yours, your elder cousin is so angry with you\nthat his teeth itch; and were it not that I prevent him, he would hit\nyou with his foot in the stomach and kick all your intestines out! Get\naway,\" she then cried; whereupon Chia Huan obediently followed Feng Erh,\nand taking the money he went all by himself to play with Ying Ch'un and\nthe rest; where we shall leave him without another word.\n\nBut to return to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. He was just amusing himself and laughing with\nPao-ch'ai, when at an unexpected moment, he heard some one announce that\nMiss Shih had come. At these words, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc rose, and was at once going\noff when \"Wait,\" shouted Pao-ch'ai with a smile, \"and we'll go over\ntogether and see her.\"\n\nSaying this, she descended from the stove-couch, and came, in company\nwith Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, to dowager lady Chia's on this side, where they saw Shih\nHsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn laughing aloud, and talking immoderately; and upon catching\nsight of them both, she promptly inquired after their healths, and\nexchanged salutations.\n\n\nLin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc just happened to be standing by, and having set the question\nto Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc \"Where do you come from?\" \"I come from cousin Pao-ch'ai's\nrooms,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc readily replied.\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc gave a sardonic smile. \"What I maintain is this,\" she rejoined,\n\"that lucky enough for you, you were detained over there; otherwise, you\nwould long ago have, at once, come flying in here!\"\n\n\"Am I only free to play with you?\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc inquired, \"and to dispel your\nennui! I simply went over to her place for a run, and that quite\ncasually, and will you insinuate all these things?\"\n\n\"Your words are quite devoid of sense,\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc added; \"whether you go or\nnot what's that to me? neither did I tell you to give me any\ndistraction; you're quite at liberty from this time forth not to pay any\nnotice to me!\"\n\nSaying this, she flew into a high dudgeon and rushed back into her room;\nbut Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc promptly followed in her footsteps: \"Here you are again in a\nhuff,\" he urged, \"and all for no reason! Had I even passed any remark\nthat I shouldn't, you should anyhow have still sat in there, and chatted\nand laughed with the others for a while; instead of that, you come again\nto sit and mope all alone!\"\n\n\"Are you my keeper?\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc expostulated.\n\n\"I couldn't, of course,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc smiled, \"presume to exercise any\ninfluence over you; but the only thing is that you are doing your own\nhealth harm!\"\n\n\"If I do ruin my health,\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc rejoined, \"and I die, it's my own\nlookout! what's that to do with you?\"\n\n\"What's the good,\" protested Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"of talking in this happy first\nmoon of dying and of living?\"\n\n\"I _will_ say die,\" insisted Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"die now, at this very moment!\nbut you're afraid of death; and you may live a long life of a hundred\nyears, but what good will that be!\"\n\n\"If all we do is to go on nagging in this way,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc remarked smiling,\n\"will I any more be afraid to die? on the contrary, it would be better\nto die, and be free!\"\n\n\"Quite so!\" continued Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc with alacrity, \"if we go on nagging in this\nway, it would be better for me to die, and that you should be free of\nme!\"\n\n\"I speak of my own self dying,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc added, \"so don't misunderstand my\nwords and accuse people wrongly.\"\n\nWhile he was as yet speaking, Pao-ch'ai entered the room: \"Cousin Shih\nis waiting for you;\" she said; and with these words, she hastily pushed\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc on, and they walked away.\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc, meanwhile, became more and more a prey to resentment; and\ndisconsolate as she felt, she shed tears in front of the window. But not\ntime enough had transpired to allow two cups of tea to be drunk, before\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc came back again. At the sight of him, Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc sobbed still more\nfervently and incessantly, and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc realising the state she was in,\nand knowing well enough how arduous a task it would be to bring her\nround, began to join together a hundred, yea a thousand kinds of soft\nphrases and tender words to console her. But at an unforeseen moment,\nand before he could himself open his mouth, he heard Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc anticipate\nhim.\n\n\"What have you come back again for?\" she asked. \"Let me die or live, as\nI please, and have done! You've really got at present some one to play\nwith you, one who, compared with me, is able to read and able to\ncompose, able to write, to speak, as well as to joke, one too who for\nfear lest you should have ruffled your temper dragged you away: and what\ndo you return here for now?\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, after listening to all she had to say, hastened to come up to\nher. \"Is it likely,\" he observed in a low tone of voice, \"that an\nintelligent person like you isn't so much as aware that near relatives\ncan't be separated by a distant relative, and a remote friend set aside\nan old friend! I'm stupid, there's no gainsaying, but I do anyhow\nunderstand what these two sentiments imply. You and I are, in the first\nplace, cousins on my father's sister's side; while sister Pao-ch'ai and\nI are two cousins on mother's sides, so that, according to the degrees\nof relationship, she's more distant than yourself. In the second place,\nyou came here first, and we two have our meals at one table and sleep in\none bed, having ever since our youth grown up together; while she has\nonly recently come, and how could I ever distance you on her account?\"\n\n\"Ts'ui!\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc exclaimed. \"Will I forsooth ever make you distance her!\nwho and what kind of person have I become to do such a thing? What (I\nsaid) was prompted by my own motives.\"\n\n\"I too,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc urged, \"made those remarks prompted by my own heart's\nmotives, and do you mean to say that your heart can only read the\nfeelings of your own heart, and has no idea whatsoever of my own?\"\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc at these words, lowered her head and said not a word. But after a\nlong interval, \"You only know,\" she continued, \"how to feel bitter\nagainst people for their action in censuring you: but you don't, after\nall, know that you yourself provoke people to such a degree, that it's\nhard for them to put up with it! Take for instance the weather of to-day\nas an example. It's distinctly very cold, to-day, and yet, how is it\nthat you are so contrary as to go and divest yourself of the pelisse\nwith the bluish breast-fur overlapping the cloth?\"\n\n\"Why say I didn't wear it?\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc smilingly observed. \"I did, but\nseeing you get angry I felt suddenly in such a terrible blaze, that I at\nonce took it off!\"\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc heaved a sigh. \"You'll by and by catch a cold,\" she remarked,\n\"and then you'll again have to starve, and vociferate for something to\neat!\"\n\nWhile these two were having this colloquy, Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn was seen to walk\nin! \"You two, Ai cousin and cousin Lin,\" she ventured jokingly, \"are\ntogether playing every day, and though I've managed to come after ever\nso much trouble, you pay no heed to me at all!\"\n\n\"It's invariably the rule,\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc retorted smilingly, \"that those who\nhave a defect in their speech will insist upon talking; she can't even\ncome out correctly with 'Erh' (secundus) cousin, and keeps on calling\nhim 'Ai' cousin, 'Ai' cousin! And by and by when you play 'Wei Ch'i'\nyou're sure also to shout out yao, ai, (instead of erh), san; (one, two,\nthree).\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc laughed. \"If you imitate her,\" he interposed, \"and get into that\nhabit, you'll also begin to bite your tongue when you talk.\"\n\n\"She won't make even the slightest allowance for any one,\" Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn\nrejoined; \"her sole idea being to pick out others' faults. You may\nreadily be superior to any mortal being, but you shouldn't, after all,\noffend against what's right and make fun of every person you come\nacross! But I'll point out some one, and if you venture to jeer her,\nI'll at once submit to you.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc vehemently inquired.\n\n\"If you do have the courage,\" Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn answered, \"to pick out cousin\nPao-ch'ai's faults, you then may well be held to be first-rate!\"\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc after hearing these words, gave a sarcastic smile. \"I was\nwondering,\" she observed, \"who it was. Is it indeed she? How could I\never presume to pick out hers?\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc allowed her no time to finish, but hastened to say something to\ninterrupt the conversation.\n\n\"I couldn't, of course, during the whole of this my lifetime,\"\nHsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn laughed, \"attain your standard! but my earnest wish is that\nby and by should be found for you, cousin Lin, a husband, who bites his\ntongue when he speaks, so that you should every minute and second listen\nto 'ai-ya-os!' O-mi-to-fu, won't then your reward be manifest to my\neyes!\"\n\nAs she made this remark, they all burst out laughing heartily, and\nHsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn speedily turned herself round and ran away.\n\nBut reader, do you want to know the sequel? Well, then listen to the\nexplanation given in the next chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n  The eminent Hsi Jen, with winsome ways, rails at Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, with a view\n      to exhortation.\n  The beauteous P'ing Erh, with soft words, screens Chia Lien.\n\n\nBut to resume our story. When Shih Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn ran out of the room, she\nwas all in a flutter lest Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc should catch her up; but Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc,\nwho came after her, readily shouted out, \"You'll trip and fall. How ever\ncould she come up to you?\"\n\nLin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc went in pursuit of her as far as the entrance, when she was\nimpeded from making further progress by Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, who stretched his arms\nout against the posts of the door.\n\n\"Were I to spare Y\u00c3\u00bcn Erh, I couldn't live!\" Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc exclaimed, as she\ntugged at his arms. But Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn, perceiving that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc obstructed\nthe door, and surmising that Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc could not come out, speedily stood\nstill. \"My dear cousin,\" she smilingly pleaded, \"do let me off this\ntime!\"\n\nBut it just happened that Pao-ch'ai, who was coming along, was at the\nback of Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn, and with a face also beaming with smiles: \"I advise\nyou both,\" she said, \"to leave off out of respect for cousin Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, and\nhave done.\"\n\n\"I don't agree to that,\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc rejoined; \"are you people, pray, all of\none mind to do nothing but make fun of me?\"\n\n\"Who ventures to make fun of you?\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc observed advisingly; \"and\nhadn't you made sport of her, would she have presumed to have said\nanything about you?\"\n\nWhile this quartet were finding it an arduous task to understand one\nanother, a servant came to invite them to have their repast, and they\neventually crossed over to the front side, and as it was already time\nfor the lamps to be lit, madame Wang, widow Li Wan, lady Feng, Ying\nCh'un, T'an Ch'un, Hsi Ch'un and the other cousins, adjourned in a body\nto dowager lady Chia's apartments on this side, where the whole company\nspent a while in a chat on irrelevant topics, after which they each\nreturned to their rooms and retired to bed. Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn, as of old,\nbetook herself to Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc's quarters to rest, and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc escorted them\nboth into their apartment, and it was after the hour had already past\nthe second watch, and Hsi Jen had come and pressed him several times,\nthat he at length returned to his own bedroom and went to sleep. The\nnext morning, as soon as it was daylight, he threw his clothes over him,\nput on his low shoes and came over into Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc's room, where he however\nsaw nothing of the two girls Tzu Ch\u00c3\u00bcan and Ts'ui Lu, as there was no one\nelse here in there besides his two cousins, still reclining under the\ncoverlets. Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc was closely wrapped in a quilt of almond-red silk, and\nlying quietly, with closed eyes fast asleep; while Shih Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn, with\nher handful of shiny hair draggling along the edge of the pillow, was\ncovered only up to the chest, and outside the coverlet rested her curved\nsnow-white arm, with the gold bracelets, which she had on.\n\nAt the sight of her, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc heaved a sigh. \"Even when asleep,\" he\nsoliloquised, \"she can't be quiet! but by and by, when the wind will\nhave blown on her, she'll again shout that her shoulder is sore!\" With\nthese words, he gently covered her, but Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc had already awoke out\nof her sleep, and becoming aware that there was some one about, she\npromptly concluded that it must, for a certainty, be Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, and turning\nherself accordingly round, and discovering at a glance that the truth\nwas not beyond her conjectures, she observed: \"What have you run over to\ndo at this early hour?\" to which question Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc replied: \"Do you call\nthis early? but get up and see for yourself!\"\n\n\"First quit the room,\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc suggested, \"and let us get up!\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc thereupon made his exit into the ante-chamber, and Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc jumped\nout of bed, and awoke Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn. When both of them had put on their\nclothes, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc re-entered and took a seat by the side of the toilet\ntable; whence he beheld Tzu-ch\u00c3\u00bcan and Hs\u00c3\u00bceh Yen walk in and wait upon\nthem, as they dressed their hair and performed their ablutions.\nHsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn had done washing her face, and Ts'\u00c3\u00bci L\u00c3\u00bc at once took the\nremaining water and was about to throw it away, when Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc interposed,\nsaying: \"Wait, I'll avail myself of this opportunity to wash too and\nfinish with it, and thus save myself the trouble of having again to go\nover!\" Speaking the while, he hastily came forward, and bending his\nwaist, he washed his face twice with two handfuls of water, and when Tzu\nCh\u00c3\u00bcan went over to give him the scented soap, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc added: \"In this\nbasin, there's a good deal of it, and there's no need of rubbing any\nmore!\" He then washed his face with two more handfuls, and forthwith\nasked for a towel, and Ts'\u00c3\u00bci L\u00c3\u00bc exclaimed: \"What! have you still got\nthis failing? when will you turn a new leaf?\" But Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc paid not so\nmuch as any heed to her, and there and then called for some salt, with\nwhich he rubbed his teeth, and rinsed his mouth. When he had done, he\nperceived that Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn had already finished combing her hair, and\nspeedily coming up to her, he put on a smile, and said: \"My dear cousin,\ncomb my hair for me!\"\n\n\"This can't be done!\" Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn objected.\n\n\"My dear cousin,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc continued smirkingly, \"how is it that you\ncombed it for me in former times?\"\n\n\"I've forgotten now how to comb it!\" Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn replied.\n\n\"I'm not, after all, going out of doors,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc observed, \"nor will I\nwear a hat or frontlet, so that all that need be done is to plait a few\nqueues, that's all!\" Saying this, he went on to appeal to her in a\nthousand and one endearing terms, so that Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn had no alternative,\nbut to draw his head nearer to her and to comb one queue after another,\nand as when he stayed at home he wore no hat, nor had, in fact, any\ntufted horns, she merely took the short surrounding hair from all four\nsides, and twisting it into small tufts, she collected it together over\nthe hair on the crown of the head, and plaited a large queue, binding it\nfast with red ribbon; while from the root of the hair to the end of the\nqueue, were four pearls in a row, below which, in the way of a tip, was\nsuspended a golden pendant.\n\n\"Of these pearls there are only three,\" Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn remarked as she went\non plaiting; \"this isn't one like them; I remember these were all of one\nkind, and how is it that there's one short?\"\n\n\"I've lost one,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc rejoined.\n\n\"It must have dropped,\" Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn added, \"when you went out of doors,\nand been picked up by some one when you were off your guard; and he's\nnow, instead of you, the richer for it.\"\n\n\"One can neither tell whether it has been really lost,\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, who\nstood by, interposed, smiling the while sarcastically; \"nor could one\nsay whether it hasn't been given away to some one to be mounted in some\ntrinket or other and worn!\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc made no reply; but set to work, seeing that the two sides of the\ndressing table were all full of toilet boxes and other such articles,\ntaking up those that came under his hand and examining them. Grasping\nunawares a box of cosmetic, which was within his reach, he would have\nliked to have brought it to his lips, but he feared again lest\nHsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn should chide him. While he was hesitating whether to do so or\nnot, Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn, from behind, stretched forth her arm and gave him a\nsmack, which sent the cosmetic flying from his hand, as she cried out:\n\"You good-for-nothing! when will you mend those weaknesses of yours!\"\nBut hardly had she had time to complete this remark, when she caught\nsight of Hsi Jen walk in, who upon perceiving this state of things,\nbecame aware that he was already combed and washed, and she felt\nconstrained to go back and attend to her own coiffure and ablutions. But\nsuddenly, she saw Pao-ch'ai come in and inquire: \"Where's cousin Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\ngone?\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say,\" Hsi Jen insinuated with a sardonic smile, \"that\nyour cousin Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc has leisure to stay at home?\"\n\nWhen Pao-ch'ai heard these words, she inwardly comprehended her meaning,\nand when she further heard Hsi Jen remark with a sigh: \"Cousins may well\nbe on intimate terms, but they should also observe some sort of\npropriety; and they shouldn't night and day romp together; and no matter\nhow people may tender advice it's all like so much wind blowing past the\nears.\" Pao-ch'ai began, at these remarks, to cogitate within her mind:\n\"May I not, possibly, have been mistaken in my estimation of this girl;\nfor to listen to her words, she would really seem to have a certain\namount of _savoir faire_!\"\n\nPao-ch'ai thereupon took a seat on the stove-couch, and quietly, in the\ncourse of their conversation on one thing and another, she managed to\nascertain her age, her native village and other such particulars, and\nthen setting her mind diligently to put, on the sly, her conversation\nand mental capacity to the test, she discovered how deeply worthy she\nwas to be respected and loved. But in a while Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc arrived, and\nPao-ch'ai at once quitted the apartment.\n\n\"How is it,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc at once inquired, \"that cousin Pao-ch'ai was\nchatting along with you so lustily, and that as soon as she saw me\nenter, she promptly ran away?\"\n\nHsi Jen did not make any reply to his first question, and it was only\nwhen he had repeated it that Hsi Jen remarked: \"Do you ask me? How can I\nknow what goes on between you two?\"\n\nWhen Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc heard these words, and he noticed that the look on her face\nwas so unlike that of former days, he lost no time in putting on a smile\nand asking: \"Why is it that you too are angry in real earnest?\"\n\n\"How could I presume to get angry!\" Hsi Jen rejoined smiling\nindifferently; \"but you mustn't, from this day forth, put your foot into\nthis room! and as you have anyhow people to wait on you, you shouldn't\ncome again to make use of my services, for I mean to go and attend to\nour old mistress, as in days of old.\"\n\nWith this remark still on her lips, she lay herself down on the\nstove-couch and closed her eyes. When Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc perceived the state of mind\nshe was in, he felt deeply surprised and could not refrain from coming\nforward and trying to cheer her up. But Hsi Jen kept her eyes closed and\npaid no heed to him, so that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was quite at a loss how to act. But\nespying She Y\u00c3\u00bceh enter the room, he said with alacrity: \"What's up with\nyour sister?\"\n\n\"Do I know?\" answered She Y\u00c3\u00bceh, \"examine your own self and you'll\nreadily know!\"\n\nAfter these words had been heard by Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, he gazed vacantly for some\ntime, feeling the while very unhappy; but raising himself impetuously:\n\"Well!\" he exclaimed, \"if you don't notice me, all right, I too will go\nto sleep,\" and as he spoke he got up, and, descending from the couch, he\nbetook himself to his own bed and went to sleep. Hsi Jen noticing that\nhe had not budged for ever so long, and that he faintly snored, presumed\nthat he must have fallen fast asleep, so she speedily rose to her feet,\nand, taking a wrapper, came over and covered him. But a sound of \"hu\"\nreached her ear, as Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc promptly threw it off and once again closed\nhis eyes and feigned sleep. Hsi Jen distinctly grasped his idea and,\nforthwith nodding her head, she smiled coldly. \"You really needn't lose\nyour temper! but from this time forth, I'll become mute, and not say one\nword to you; and what if I do?\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc could not restrain himself from rising. \"What have I been up to\nagain,\" he asked, \"that you're once more at me with your advice? As far\nas your advice goes, it's all well and good; but just now without one\nword of counsel, you paid no heed to me when I came in, but, flying into\na huff, you went to sleep. Nor could I make out what it was all about,\nand now here you are again maintaining that I'm angry. But when did I\nhear you, pray, give me a word of advice of any kind?\"\n\n\"Doesn't your mind yet see for itself?\" Hsi Jen replied; \"and do you\nstill expect me to tell you?\"\n\nWhile they were disputing, dowager lady Chia sent a servant to call him\nto his repast, and he thereupon crossed over to the front; but after he\nhad hurriedly swallowed a few bowls of rice, he returned to his own\napartment, where he discovered Hsi Jen reclining on the outer\nstove-couch, while She Y\u00c3\u00bceh was playing with the dominoes by her side.\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc had been ever aware of the intimacy which existed between She\nY\u00c3\u00bceh and Hsi Jen, so that paying not the slightest notice to even She\nY\u00c3\u00bceh, he raised the soft portiere and straightway walked all alone into\nthe inner apartment. She Y\u00c3\u00bceh felt constrained to follow him in, but\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc at once pushed her out, saying: \"I don't venture to disturb you\ntwo;\" so that She Y\u00c3\u00bceh had no alternative but to leave the room with a\nsmiling countenance, and to bid two young waiting-maids go in. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\ntook hold of a book and read for a considerable time in a reclining\nposition; but upon raising his head to ask for some tea, he caught sight\nof a couple of waiting-maids, standing below; the one of whom, slightly\nolder than the other, was exceedingly winsome.\n\n\"What's your name?\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc eagerly inquired.\n\n\"I'm called Hui Hsiang, (orchid fragrance),\" that waiting-maid rejoined\nsimperingly.\n\n\"Who gave you this name?\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc went on to ask.\n\n\"I went originally under the name of Y\u00c3\u00bcn Hsiang (Gum Sandarac),\" added\nHui Hsiang, \"but Miss Hua it was who changed it.\"\n\n\"You should really be called Hui Ch'i, (latent fragrance), that would be\nproper; and why such stuff as Hui Hsiang, (orchid fragrance)?\"\n\n\"How many sisters have you got?\" he further went on to ask of her.\n\n\"Four,\" replied Hui Hsiang.\n\n\"Which of them are you?\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc asked.\n\n\"The fourth,\" answered Hui Hsiang.\n\n\"By and by you must be called Ssu Erh, (fourth child),\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\nsuggested, \"for there's no need for any such nonsense as Hui Hsiang\n(orchid fragrance) or Lan Ch'i (epidendrum perfume.) Which single girl\ndeserves to be compared to all these flowers, without profaning pretty\nnames and fine surnames!\"\n\nAs he uttered these words, he bade her give him some tea, which he\ndrank; while Hsi Jen and She Y\u00c3\u00bceh, who were in the outer apartment, had\nbeen listening for a long time and laughing with compressed lips.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc did not, on this day, so much as put his foot outside the door of\nhis room, but sat all alone sad and dejected, simply taking up his\nbooks, in order to dispel his melancholy fit, or diverting himself with\nhis writing materials; while he did not even avail himself of the\nservices of any of the family servants, but simply bade Ssu Erh answer\nhis calls.\n\nThis Ssu Erh was, who would have thought it, a girl gifted with\nmatchless artfulness, and perceiving that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had requisitioned her\nservices, she speedily began to devise extreme ways and means to\ninveigle him. When evening came, and dinner was over, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's eyes were\nscorching hot and his ears burning from the effects of two cups of wine\nthat he had taken. Had it been in past days, he would have now had Hsi\nJen and her companions with him, and with all their good cheer and\nlaughter, he would have been enjoying himself. But here was he, on this\noccasion, dull and forlorn, a solitary being, gazing at the lamp with an\nabsolute lack of pleasure. By and by he felt a certain wish to go after\nthem, but dreading that if they carried their point, they would, in the\nfuture, come and tender advice still more immoderate, and that, were he\nto put on the airs of a superior to intimidate them, he would appear to\nbe too deeply devoid of all feeling, he therefore, needless to say,\nthwarted the wish of his heart, and treated them just as if they were\ndead. And as anyway he was constrained also to live, alone though he\nwas, he readily looked upon them, for the time being as departed, and\ndid not worry his mind in the least on their account. On the contrary,\nhe was able to feel happy and contented with his own society. Hence it\nwas that bidding Ssu Erh trim the candles and brew the tea, he himself\nperused for a time the \"Nan Hua Ching,\" and upon reaching the precept:\n\"On thieves,\" given on some additional pages, the burden of which was:\n\"Therefore by exterminating intuitive wisdom, and by discarding\nknowledge, highway robbers will cease to exist, and by taking off the\njade and by putting away the pearls, pilferers will not spring to\nexistence; by burning the slips and by breaking up the seals, by\nsmashing the measures, and snapping the scales, the result will be that\nthe people will not wrangle; by abrogating, to the utmost degree, wise\nrules under the heavens, the people will, at length, be able to take\npart in deliberation. By putting to confusion the musical scale, and\ndestroying fifes and lutes, by deafening the ears of the blind Kuang,\nthen, at last, will the human race in the world constrain his sense of\nhearing. By extinguishing literary compositions, by dispersing the five\ncolours and by sticking the eyes of Li Chu, then, at length, mankind\nunder the whole sky, will restrain the perception of his eyes. By\ndestroying and eliminating the hooks and lines, by discarding the\ncompasses and squares, and by amputating Kung Chui's fingers, the human\nrace will ultimately succeed in constraining his ingenuity,\"--his high\nspirits, on perusal of this passage, were so exultant that taking\nadvantage of the exuberance caused by the wine, he picked up his pen,\nfor he could not repress himself, and continued the text in this wise:\n\"By burning the flower, (Hua-Hsi Jen) and dispersing the musk, (She\nY\u00c3\u00bceh), the consequence will be that the inmates of the inner chambers\nwill, eventually, keep advice to themselves. By obliterating Pao-ch'ai's\nsupernatural beauty, by reducing to ashes Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc's spiritual perception,\nand by destroying and extinguishing my affectionate preferences, the\nbeautiful in the inner chambers as well as the plain will then, at\nlength, be put on the same footing. And as they will keep advice to\nthemselves, there will be no fear of any disagreement. By obliterating\nher supernatural beauty, I shall then have no incentive for any violent\naffection; by dissolving her spiritual perception, I will have no\nfeelings with which to foster the memory of her talents. The hair-pin,\njade, flower and musk (Pao-ch'ai, Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, Hsi Jen and She Y\u00c3\u00bceh) do each\nand all spread out their snares and dig mines, and thus succeed in\ninveigling and entrapping every one in the world.\"\n\nAt the conclusion of this annex, he flung the pen away, and lay himself\ndown to sleep. His head had barely reached the pillow before he at once\nfell fast asleep, remaining the whole night long perfectly unconscious\nof everything straight up to the break of day, when upon waking and\nturning himself round, he, at a glance, caught sight of no one else than\nHsi Jen, sleeping in her clothes over the coverlet.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc had already banished from his mind every thought of what had\ntranspired the previous day, so that forthwith giving Hsi Jen a push:\n\"Get up!\" he said, \"and be careful where you sleep, as you may catch\ncold.\"\n\nThe fact is that Hsi Jen was aware that he was, without regard to day or\nnight, ever up to mischief with his female cousins; but presuming that\nif she earnestly called him to account, he would not mend his ways, she\nhad, for this reason, had recourse to tender language to exhort him, in\nthe hope that, in a short while, he would come round again to his better\nself. But against all her expectations Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had, after the lapse of a\nwhole day and night, not changed the least in his manner, and as she\nreally was in her heart quite at a loss what to do, she failed to find\nthroughout the whole night any proper sleep. But when on this day, she\nunexpectedly perceived Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc in this mood, she flattered herself that\nhe had made up his mind to effect a change, and readily thought it best\nnot to notice him. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, seeing that she made no reply, forthwith\nstretched out his hand and undid her jacket; but he had just unclasped\nthe button, when his arm was pushed away by Hsi Jen, who again made it\nfast herself.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc was so much at his wit's ends that he had no alternative but to\ntake her hand and smilingly ask: \"What's the matter with you, after all,\nthat I've had to ask you something time after time?\"\n\nHsi Jen opened her eyes wide. \"There's nothing really the matter with\nme!\" she observed; \"but as you're awake, you surely had better be going\nover into the opposite room to comb your hair and wash; for if you\ndilly-dally any longer, you won't be in time.\"\n\n\"Where shall I go over to?\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc inquired.\n\nHsi Jen gave a sarcastic grin. \"Do you ask me?\" she rejoined; \"do I\nknow? you're at perfect liberty to go over wherever you like; from this\nday forth you and I must part company so as to avoid fighting like cocks\nor brawling like geese, to the amusement of third parties. Indeed, when\nyou get surfeited on that side, you come over to this, where there are,\nafter all, such girls as Fours and Fives (Ssu Erh and Wu Erh) to dance\nattendance upon you. But such kind of things as ourselves uselessly\ndefile fine names and fine surnames.\"\n\n\"Do you still remember this to-day!\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc asked with a smirk.\n\n\"Hundred years hence I shall still bear it in mind,\" Hsi Jen protested;\n\"I'm not like you, who treat my words as so much wind blowing by the\nside of your ears, that what I've said at night, you've forgotten early\nin the morning.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc perceiving what a seductive though angry air pervaded her face\nfound it difficult to repress his feelings, and speedily taking up, from\nthe side of the pillow, a hair-pin made of jade, he dashed it down\nbreaking it into two exclaiming: \"If I again don't listen to your words,\nmay I fare like this hair-pin.\"\n\nHsi Jen immediately picked up the hair-pin, as she remarked: \"What's up\nwith you at this early hour of the morning? Whether you listen or not is\nof no consequence; and is it worth while that you should behave as you\ndo?\"\n\n\"How can you know,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc answered, \"the anguish in my heart!\"\n\n\"Do you also know what anguish means?\" Hsi Jen observed laughing; \"if\nyou do, then you can judge what the state of my heart is! But be quick\nand get up, and wash your face and be off!\"\n\nAs she spoke, they both got out of bed and performed their toilette; but\nafter Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had gone to the drawing rooms, and at a moment least\nexpected by any one, Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc walked into his apartment. Noticing that\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc was not in, she was fumbling with the books on the table and\nexamining them, when, as luck would have it, she turned up the Chuang\nTzu of the previous day. Upon perusing the passage tagged on by Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc,\nshe could not help feeling both incensed and amused. Nor could she\nrestrain herself from taking up the pen and appending a stanza to this\neffect:\n\n  Who is that man, who of his pen, without good rhyme, made use,\n  A toilsome task to do into the Chuang-tzu text to steal,\n  Who for the knowledge he doth lack no sense of shame doth feel,\n  But language vile and foul employs third parties to abuse?\n\nAt the conclusion of what she had to write, she too came into the\ndrawing room; but after paying her respects to dowager lady Chia, she\nwalked over to madame Wang's quarters.\n\nContrary to everybody's expectations, lady Feng's daughter, Ta Chieh\nErh, had fallen ill, and a great fuss was just going on as the doctor\nhad been sent for to diagnose her ailment.\n\n\"My congratulations to you, ladies,\" the doctor explained; \"this young\nlady has fever, as she has small-pox; indeed it's no other complaint!\"\n\nAs soon as madame Wang and lady Feng heard the tidings, they lost no\ntime in sending round to ascertain whether she was getting on all right\nor not, and the doctor replied: \"The symptoms are, it is true, serious,\nbut favourable; but though after all importing no danger, it's necessary\nto get ready the silkworms and pigs' tails.\"\n\nWhen lady Feng received this report, she, there and then, hastened to\nmake the necessary preparations, and while she had the rooms swept and\noblations offered to the goddess of small-pox, she, at the same time,\ntransmitted orders to her household to avoid viands fried or roasted in\nfat, or other such heating things; and also bade P'ing Erh get ready the\nbedding and clothes for Chia Lien in a separate room, and taking pieces\nof deep red cotton material, she distributed them to the nurses,\nwaiting-maids and all the servants, who were in close attendance, to cut\nout clothes for themselves. And having had likewise some apartments\noutside swept clean, she detained two doctors to alternately deliberate\non the treatment, feel the pulse and administer the medicines; and for\ntwelve days, they were not at liberty to return to their homes; while\nChia Lien had no help but to move his quarters temporarily into the\nouter library, and lady Feng and P'ing Erh remained both in daily\nattendance upon madame Wang in her devotions to the goddess.\n\nChia Lien, now that he was separated from lady Feng, soon felt disposed\nto look round for a flame. He had only slept alone for a couple of\nnights, but these nights had been so intensely intolerable that he had\nno option than to choose, for the time being, from among the young\npages, those who were of handsome appearance, and bring them over to\nrelieve his monotony. In the Jung Kuo mansion, there was, it happened, a\ncook, a most useless, good-for-nothing drunkard, whose name was To Kuan,\nin whom people recognised an infirm and a useless husband so that they\nall dubbed him with the name of To Hun Ch'ung, the stupid worm To. As\nthe wife given to him in marriage by his father and mother was this year\njust twenty, and possessed further several traits of beauty, and was\nalso naturally of a flighty and frivolous disposition, she had an\nextreme penchant for violent flirtations. But To Hun-ch'ung, on the\nother hand, did not concern himself (with her deportment), and as long\nas he had wine, meat and money he paid no heed whatever to anything. And\nfor this reason it was that all the men in the two mansions of Ning and\nJung had been successful in their attentions; and as this woman was\nexceptionally fascinating and incomparably giddy, she was generally\nknown by all by the name To Ku Ning (Miss To).\n\nChia Lien, now that he had his quarters outside, chafed under the pangs\nof irksome ennui, yet he too, in days gone by, had set his eyes upon\nthis woman, and had for long, watered in the mouth with admiration; but\nas, inside, he feared his winsome wife, and outside, he dreaded his\nbeloved lads, he had not made any advances. But this To Ku Niang had\nlikewise a liking for Chia Lien, and was full of resentment at the\nabsence of a favourable opportunity; but she had recently come to hear\nthat Chia Lien had shifted his quarters into the outer library, and her\nwont was, even in the absence of any legitimate purpose, to go over\nthree and four times to entice him on; but though Chia Lien was, in\nevery respect, like a rat smitten with hunger, he could not dispense\nwith holding consultation with the young friends who enjoyed his\nconfidence; and as he struck a bargain with them for a large amount of\nmoney and silks, how could they ever not have come to terms (with him to\nspeak on his behalf)? Besides, they were all old friends of this woman,\nso that, as soon as they conveyed the proposal, she willingly accepted\nit. When night came To Hun Ch'ung was lying on the couch in a state of\ndrunkenness, and at the second watch, when every one was quiet, Chia\nLien at once slipped in, and they had their assignation. As soon as he\ngazed upon her face, he lost control over his senses, and without even\none word of ordinary greeting or commonplace remark, they forthwith,\nfervently indulged in a most endearing t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate.\n\nThis woman possessed, who could have thought it, a strange natural\ncharm; for, as soon as any one of her lovers came within any close\ndistance of her, he speedily could not but notice that her very tendons\nand bones mollified, paralysed-like from feeling, so that his was the\nsensation of basking in a soft bower of love. What is more, her\ndemonstrative ways and free-and-easy talk put even those of a born\ncoquette to shame, with the result that while Chia Lien, at this time,\nlonged to become heart and soul one with her, the woman designedly\nindulged in immodest innuendoes.\n\n\"Your daughter is at home,\" she insinuated in her recumbent position,\n\"ill with the small-pox, and prayers are being offered to the goddess;\nand your duty too should be to abstain from love affairs for a couple of\ndays, but on the contrary, by flirting with me, you've contaminated\nyourself! but, you'd better be off at once from me here!\"\n\n\"You're my goddess!\" gaspingly protested Chia Lien, as he gave way to\ndemonstrativeness; \"what do I care about any other goddess!\"\n\nThe woman began to be still more indelicate in her manner, so that Chia\nLien could not refrain himself from making a full exhibition of his warm\nsentiments. When their t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate had come to a close, they both went\non again to vow by the mountains and swear by the seas, and though they\nfound it difficult to part company and hard to tear themselves away,\nthey, in due course, became, after this occasion, mutual sworn friends.\nBut by a certain day the virus in Ta Chieh's system had become\nexhausted, and the spots subsided, and at the expiry of twelve days the\ngoddess was removed, and the whole household offered sacrifices to\nheaven, worshipped the ancestors, paid their vows, burnt incense,\nexchanged congratulations, and distributed presents. And these\nformalities observed, Chia Lien once more moved back into his own\nbedroom and was reunited with lady Feng. The proverb is indeed true\nwhich says: \"That a new marriage is not equal to a long separation,\" for\nthere ensued between them demonstrations of loving affection still more\nnumerous than heretofore, to which we need not, of course, refer with\nany minuteness.\n\nThe next day, at an early hour, after lady Feng had gone into the upper\nrooms, P'ing Erh set to work to put in order the clothes and bedding,\nwhich had been brought from outside, when, contrary to her expectation,\na tress of hair fell out from inside the pillow-case, as she was intent\nupon shaking it. P'ing Erh understood its import, and taking at once the\nhair, she concealed it in her sleeve, and there and then came over into\nthe room on this side, where she produced the hair, and smirkingly asked\nChia Lien, \"What's this?\"\n\nChia Lien, at the sight of it, lost no time in making a snatch with the\nidea of depriving her of it; and when P'ing Erh speedily endeavoured to\nrun away, she was clutched by Chia Lien, who put her down on the\nstove-couch, and came up to take it from her hand.\n\n\"You heartless fellow!\" P'ing Erh laughingly exclaimed, \"I conceal this,\nwith every good purpose, from her knowledge, and come to ask you about\nit, and you, on the contrary, fly into a rage! But wait till she comes\nback, and I'll tell her, and we'll see what will happen.\"\n\nAt these words, Chia Lien hastily forced a smile. \"Dear girl!\" he\nentreated, \"give it to me, and I won't venture again to fly into a\npassion.\"\n\nBut hardly was this remark finished, when they heard the voice of lady\nFeng penetrate into the room. As soon as it reached the ear of Chia\nLien, he was at a loss whether it was better to let her go or to snatch\nit away, and kept on shouting, \"My dear girl! don't let her know.\"\n\nP'ing Erh at once rose to her feet; but lady Feng had already entered\nthe room; and she went on to bid P'ing Erh be quick and open a box and\nfind a pattern for madame Wang. P'ing Erh expressed her obedience with\nalacrity; but while in search of it, lady Feng caught sight of Chia\nLien; and suddenly remembering something, she hastened to ask P'ing Erh\nabout it.\n\n\"The other day,\" she observed, \"some things were taken out, and have you\nbrought them all in or not?\"\n\n\"I have!\" P'ing Erh assented.\n\n\"Is there anything short or not?\" lady Feng inquired.\n\n\"I've carefully looked at them,\" P'ing Erh added, \"and haven't found\neven one single thing short.\"\n\n\"Is there anything in excess?\" lady Feng went on to ascertain.\n\nP'ing Erh laughed. \"It's enough,\" she rejoined, \"that there's nothing\nshort; and how could there really turn out to be anything over and\nabove?\"\n\n\"That this half month,\" lady Feng continued still smiling, \"things have\ngone on immaculately it would be hard to vouch; for some intimate friend\nthere may have been, who possibly has left something behind, in the\nshape of a ring, handkerchief or other such object, there's no saying\nfor certain!\"\n\nWhile these words were being spoken, Chia Lien's face turned perfectly\nsallow, and, as he stood behind lady Feng, he was intent upon gazing at\nP'ing Erh, making signs to her (that he was going) to cut her throat as\na chicken is killed, (threatening her not to utter a sound) and\nentreating her to screen him; but P'ing Erh pretended not to notice him,\nand consequently observed smiling: \"How is it that my ideas should\ncoincide with those of yours, my lady; and as I suspected that there may\nhave been something of the kind, I carefully searched all over, but I\ndidn't find even so much as the slightest thing wrong; and if you don't\nbelieve me, my lady, you can search for your own self.\"\n\n\"You fool!\" lady Feng laughed, \"had he any things of the sort, would he\nbe likely to let you and I discover them!\"\n\nWith these words still on her lips, she took the patterns and went her\nway; whereupon P'ing Erh pointed at her nose, and shook her head to and\nfro. \"In this matter,\" she smiled, \"how much you should be grateful to\nme!\" A remark which so delighted Chia Lien that his eyebrows distended,\nand his eyes smiled, and running over, he clasped her in his embrace,\nand called her promiscuously: \"My darling, my pet, my own treasure!\"\n\n\"This,\" observed P'ing Erh, with the tress in her hand, \"will be my\nsource of power, during all my lifetime! if you treat me kindly, then\nwell and good! but if you behave unkindly, then we'll at once produce\nthis thing!\"\n\n\"Do put it away, please,\" Chia Lien entreated smirkingly, \"and don't, on\nan any account, let her know about it!\" and as he uttered these words,\nhe noticed that she was off her guard, and, with a snatch, readily\ngrabbed it adding laughingly: \"In your hands, it would be a source of\nwoe, so that it's better that I should burn it, and have done with it!\"\nSaying this he simultaneously shoved it down the sides of his boot,\nwhile P'ing Erh shouted as she set her teeth close: \"You wicked man! you\ncross the river and then demolish the bridge! but do you imagine that\nI'll by and by again tell lies on your behalf!\"\n\nChia Lien perceiving how heart-stirring her seductive charms were,\nforthwith clasped her in his arms, and begged her to be his; but P'ing\nErh snatched her hands out of his grasp and ran away out of the room;\nwhich so exasperated Chia Lien that as he bent his body, he exclaimed,\nfull of indignation: \"What a dreadful niggardly young wench! she\nactually sets her mind to stir up people's affections with her wanton\nblandishments, and then, after all, she runs away!\"\n\n\"If I be wanton, it's my own look-out;\" P'ing Erh answered, from outside\nthe window, with a grin, \"and who told you to arouse your affections? Do\nyou forsooth mean to imply that my wish is to become your tool? And did\nshe come to know about it would she again ever forgive me?\"\n\n\"You needn't dread her!\" Chia Lien urged; \"wait till my monkey is up,\nand I'll take this jealous woman, and beat her to atoms; and she'll then\nknow what stuff I'm made of. She watches me just as she would watch a\nthief! and she's only to hobnob with men, and I'm not to say a word to\nany girl! and if I do say aught to a girl, or get anywhere near one, she\nmust at once give way to suspicion. But with no regard to younger\nbrothers or nephews, to young and old, she prattles and giggles with\nthem, and doesn't entertain any fear that I may be jealous; but\nhenceforward I too won't allow her to set eyes upon any man.\"\n\n\"If she be jealous, there's every reason,\" P'ing Erh answered, \"but for\nyou to be jealous on her account isn't right. Her conduct is really\nstraightforward, and her deportment upright, but your conduct is\nactuated by an evil heart, so much so that even I don't feel my heart at\nease, not to say anything of her.\"\n\n\"You two,\" continued Chia Lien, \"have a mouth full of malicious breath!\nEverything the couple of you do is invariably proper, while whatever I\ndo is all from an evil heart! But some time or other I shall bring you\nboth to your end with my own hands!\"\n\nThis sentence was scarcely at an end, when lady Feng walked into the\ncourt. \"If you're bent upon chatting,\" she urgently inquired, upon\nseeing P'ing Erh outside the window, \"why don't you go into the room?\nand what do you mean, instead, by running out, and speaking with the\nwindow between?\"\n\nChia Lien from inside took up the string of the conversation. \"You\nshould ask her,\" he said. \"It would verily seem as if there were a tiger\nin the room to eat her up.\"\n\n\"There's not a single person in the room,\" P'ing Erh rejoined, \"and what\nshall I stay and do with him?\"\n\n\"It's just the proper thing that there should be no one else! Isn't it?\"\nlady Feng remarked grinning sarcastically.\n\n\"Do these words allude to me?\" P'ing Erh hastily asked, as soon as she\nhad heard what she said.\n\nLady Feng forthwith laughed. \"If they don't allude to you,\" she\ncontinued, \"to whom do they?\"\n\n\"Don't press me to come out with some nice things!\" P'ing Erh\ninsinuated, and, as she spoke, she did not even raise the portiere (for\nlady Feng to enter), but straightway betook herself to the opposite\nside.\n\nLady Feng lifted the portiere with her own hands, and walked into the\nroom. \"That girl P'ing Erh,\" she exclaimed, \"has gone mad, and if this\nhussey does in real earnest wish to try and get the upper hand of me, it\nwould be well for you to mind your skin.\"\n\nChia Lien listened to her, as he kept reclining on the couch. \"I never\nin the least knew,\" he ventured, clapping his hands and laughing, \"that\nP'ing Erh was so dreadful; and I must, after all, from henceforth look\nup to her with respect!\"\n\n\"It's all through your humouring her,\" lady Feng rejoined; \"so I'll\nsimply settle scores with you and finish with it.\"\n\n\"Ts'ui!\" ejaculated Chia Lien at these words, \"because you two can't\nagree, must you again make a scapegoat of me! Well then, I'll get out of\nthe way of both of you!\"\n\n\"I'll see where you'll go and hide,\" lady Feng observed.\n\n\"I've got somewhere to go!\" Chia Lien added; and with these words, he\nwas about to go, when lady Feng urged: \"Don't be off! I have something\nto tell you.\"\n\nWhat it is, is not yet known, but, reader, listen to the account given\nin the next chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n  Upon hearing the text of the stanza, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc comprehends the Buddhistic\n      spells.\n  While the enigmas for the lanterns are being devised, Chia Cheng is\n      grieved by a prognostic.\n\n\nChia Lien, for we must now prosecute our story, upon hearing lady Feng\nobserve that she had something to consult about with him, felt\nconstrained to halt and to inquire what it was about.\n\n\"On the 21st,\" lady Feng explained, \"is cousin Hs\u00c3\u00bceh's birthday, and\nwhat do you, after all, purpose doing?\"\n\n\"Do I know what to do?\" exclaimed Chia Lien; \"you have made, time and\nagain, arrangements for ever so many birthdays of grown-up people, and\ndo you, really, find yourself on this occasion without any resources?\"\n\n\"Birthdays of grown-up people are subject to prescribed rules,\" lady\nFeng expostulated; \"but her present birthday is neither one of an adult\nnor that of an infant, and that's why I would like to deliberate with\nyou!\"\n\nChia Lien upon hearing this remark, lowered his head and gave himself to\nprotracted reflection. \"You're indeed grown dull!\" he cried; \"why you've\na precedent ready at hand to suit your case! Cousin Lin's birthday\naffords a precedent, and what you did in former years for cousin Lin,\nyou can in this instance likewise do for cousin Hs\u00c3\u00bceh, and it will be\nall right.\"\n\nAt these words lady Feng gave a sarcastic smile. \"Do you, pray, mean to\ninsinuate,\" she added, \"that I'm not aware of even this! I too had\npreviously come, after some thought, to this conclusion; but old lady\nChia explained, in my hearing yesterday, that having made inquiries\nabout all their ages and their birthdays, she learnt that cousin Hs\u00c3\u00bceh\nwould this year be fifteen, and that though this was not the birthday,\nwhich made her of age, she could anyhow well be regarded as being on the\ndawn of the year, in which she would gather up her hair, so that our\ndowager lady enjoined that her anniversary should, as a matter of\ncourse, be celebrated, unlike that of cousin Lin.\"\n\n\"Well, in that case,\" Chia Lien suggested, \"you had better make a few\nadditions to what was done for cousin Lin!\"\n\n\"That's what I too am thinking of,\" lady Feng replied, \"and that's why\nI'm asking your views; for were I, on my own hook, to add anything you\nwould again feel hurt for my not have explained things to you.\"\n\n\"That will do, that will do!\" Chia Lien rejoined laughing, \"none of\nthese sham attentions for me! So long as you don't pry into my doings it\nwill be enough; and will I go so far as to bear you a grudge?\"\n\nWith these words still in his mouth, he forthwith went off. But leaving\nhim alone we shall now return to Shih Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn. After a stay of a\ncouple of days, her intention was to go back, but dowager lady Chia\nsaid: \"Wait until after you have seen the theatrical performance, when\nyou can return home.\"\n\nAt this proposal, Shih Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn felt constrained to remain, but she,\nat the same time, despatched a servant to her home to fetch two pieces\nof needlework, which she had in former days worked with her own hands,\nfor a birthday present for Pao-ch'ai.\n\nContrary to all expectations old lady Chia had, since the arrival of\nPao-ch'ai, taken quite a fancy to her, for her sedateness and good\nnature, and as this happened to be the first birthday which she was\nabout to celebrate (in the family) she herself readily contributed\ntwenty taels which, after sending for lady Feng, she handed over to her,\nto make arrangements for a banquet and performance.\n\n\"A venerable senior like yourself,\" lady Feng thereupon smiled and\nventured, with a view to enhancing her good cheer, \"is at liberty to\ncelebrate the birthday of a child in any way agreeable to you, without\nany one presuming to raise any objection; but what's the use again of\ngiving a banquet? But since it be your good pleasure and your purpose to\nhave it celebrated with \u00c3\u00a9clat, you could, needless to say, your own self\nhave spent several taels from the private funds in that old treasury of\nyours! But you now produce those twenty taels, spoiled by damp and\nmould, to play the hostess with, with the view indeed of compelling us\nto supply what's wanted! But hadn't you really been able to contribute\nany more, no one would have a word to say; but the gold and silver,\nround as well as flat, have with their heavy weight pressed down the\nbottom of the box! and your sole object is to harass us and to extort\nfrom us. But raise your eyes and look about you; who isn't your\nvenerable ladyship's son and daughter? and is it likely, pray, that in\nthe future there will only be cousin Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc to carry you, our old lady,\non his head, up the Wu T'ai Shan? You may keep all these things for him\nalone! but though we mayn't at present, deserve that anything should be\nspent upon us, you shouldn't go so far as to place us in any\nperplexities (by compelling us to subscribe). And is this now enough for\nwines, and enough for the theatricals?\"\n\nAs she bandied these words, every one in the whole room burst out\nlaughing, and even dowager lady Chia broke out in laughter while she\nobserved: \"Do you listen to that mouth? I myself am looked upon as\nhaving the gift of the gab, but why is it that I can't talk in such a\nwise as to put down this monkey? Your mother-in-law herself doesn't dare\nto be so overbearing in her speech; and here you are jabber, jabber with\nme!\"\n\n\"My mother-in-law,\" explained lady Feng, \"is also as fond of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc as\nyou are, so much so that I haven't anywhere I could go and give vent to\nmy grievances; and instead of (showing me some regard) you say that I'm\noverbearing in my speech!\"\n\nWith these words, she again enticed dowager lady Chia to laugh for a\nwhile. The old lady continued in the highest of spirits, and, when\nevening came, and they all appeared in her presence to pay their\nobeisance, her ladyship made it a point, while the whole company of\nladies and young ladies were engaged in chatting, to ascertain of\nPao-ch'ai what play she liked to hear, and what things she fancied to\neat.\n\nPao-ch'ai was well aware that dowager lady Chia, well up in years though\nshe was, delighted in sensational performances, and was partial to sweet\nand tender viands, so that she readily deferred, in every respect, to\nthose things, which were to the taste of her ladyship, and enumerated a\nwhole number of them, which made the old lady become the more exuberant.\nAnd the next day, she was the first to send over clothes, nicknacks and\nsuch presents, while madame Wang and lady Feng, Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc and the other\ngirls, as well as the whole number of inmates had all presents for her,\nregulated by their degree of relationship, to which we need not allude\nin detail.\n\nWhen the 21st arrived, a stage of an ordinary kind, small but yet handy,\nwas improvised in dowager lady Chia's inner court, and a troupe of young\nactors, who had newly made their d\u00c3\u00a9but, was retained for the nonce,\namong whom were both those who could sing tunes, slow as well as fast.\nIn the drawing rooms of the old lady were then laid out several tables\nfor a family banquet and entertainment, at which there was not a single\noutside guest; and with the exception of Mrs. Hs\u00c3\u00bceh, Shih Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn,\nand Pao-ch'ai, who were visitors, the rest were all inmates of her\nhousehold.\n\nOn this day, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc failed, at any early hour, to see anything of Lin\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc, and coming at once to her rooms in search of her, he discovered\nher reclining on the stove-couch. \"Get up,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc pressed her with a\nsmile, \"and come and have breakfast, for the plays will commence\nshortly; but whichever plays you would like to listen to, do tell me so\nthat I may be able to choose them.\"\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc smiled sarcastically. \"In that case,\" she rejoined, \"you had\nbetter specially engage a troupe and select those I like sung for my\nbenefit; for on this occasion you can't be so impertinent as to make use\nof their expense to ask me what I like!\"\n\n\"What's there impossible about this?\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc answered smiling; \"well,\nto-morrow I'll readily do as you wish, and ask them too to make use of\nwhat is yours and mine.\"\n\nAs he passed this remark, he pulled her up, and taking her hand in his\nown, they walked out of the room and came and had breakfast. When the\ntime arrived to make a selection of the plays, dowager lady Chia of her\nown motion first asked Pao-ch'ai to mark off those she liked; and though\nfor a time Pao-ch'ai declined, yielding the choice to others, she had no\nalternative but to decide, fixing upon a play called, \"the Record of the\nWestern Tour,\" a play of which the old lady was herself very fond. Next\nin order, she bade lady Feng choose, and lady Feng, had, after all, in\nspite of madame Wang ranking before her in precedence, to consider old\nlady Chia's request, and not to presume to show obstinacy by any\ndisobedience. But as she knew well enough that her ladyship had a\npenchant for what was exciting, and that she was still more partial to\njests, jokes, epigrams, and buffoonery, she therefore hastened to\nprecede (madame Wang) and to choose a play, which was in fact no other\nthan \"Liu Erh pawns his clothes.\"\n\nDowager lady Chia was, of course, still more elated. And after this she\nspeedily went on to ask Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc to choose. Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc likewise concedingly\nyielded her turn in favour of madame Wang and the other seniors, to make\ntheir selections before her, but the old lady expostulated. \"To-day,\"\nshe said, \"is primarily an occasion, on which I've brought all of you\nhere for your special recreation; and we had better look after our own\nselves and not heed them! For have I, do you imagine, gone to the\ntrouble of having a performance and laying a feast for their special\nbenefit? they're already reaping benefit enough by being in here,\nlistening to the plays and partaking of the banquet, when they have no\nright to either; and are they to be pressed further to make a choice of\nplays?\"\n\nAt these words, the whole company had a hearty laugh; after which,\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc, at length, marked off a play; next in order following Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc,\nShih Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn, Ying-ch'un, T'an Ch'un, Hsi Ch'un, widow Li Wan, and\nthe rest, each and all of whom made a choice of plays, which were sung\nin the costumes necessary for each. When the time came to take their\nplaces at the banquet, dowager lady Chia bade Pao-ch'ai make another\nselection, and Pao-ch'ai cast her choice upon the play: \"Lu Chih-shen,\nin a fit of drunkenness stirs up a disturbance up the Wu T'ai mountain;\"\nwhereupon Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc interposed, with the remark: \"All you fancy is to\nchoose plays of this kind;\" to which Pao-ch'ai rejoined, \"You've\nlistened to plays all these years to no avail! How could you know the\nbeauties of this play? the stage effect is grand, but what is still\nbetter are the apt and elegant passages in it.\"\n\n\"I've always had a dread of such sensational plays as these!\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\nretorted.\n\n\"If you call this play sensational,\" Pao-ch'ai smilingly expostulated,\n\"well then you may fitly be looked upon as being no connoisseur of\nplays. But come over and I'll tell you. This play constitutes one of a\nset of books, entitled the 'Pei Tien Peng Ch'un,' which, as far as\nharmony, musical rests and closes, and tune go, is, it goes without\nsaying, perfect; but there's among the elegant compositions a ballad\nentitled: 'the Parasitic Plant,' written in a most excellent style; but\nhow could you know anything about it?\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, upon hearing her speak of such points of beauty, hastily drew\nnear to her. \"My dear cousin,\" he entreated, \"recite it and let me hear\nit!\" Whereupon Pao-ch'ai went on as follows:\n\n  My manly tears I will not wipe away,\n  But from this place, the scholar's home, I'll stray.\n  The bonze for mercy I shall thank; under the lotus altar shave my\n      pate;\n  With Y\u00c3\u00bcan to be the luck I lack; soon in a twinkle we shall separate,\n  And needy and forlorn I'll come and go, with none to care about my\n      fate.\n  Thither shall I a suppliant be for a fog wrapper and rain hat; my\n      warrant I shall roll,\n  And listless with straw shoes and broken bowl, wherever to convert my\n      fate may be, I'll stroll.\n\nAs soon as Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had listened to her recital, he was so full of\nenthusiasm, that, clapping his knees with his hands, and shaking his\nhead, he gave vent to incessant praise; after which he went on to extol\nPao-ch'ai, saying: \"There's no book that you don't know.\"\n\n\"Be quiet, and listen to the play,\" Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc urged; \"they haven't yet\nsung about the mountain gate, and you already pretend to be mad!\"\n\nAt these words, Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn also laughed. But, in due course, the whole\nparty watched the performance until evening, when they broke up. Dowager\nlady Chia was so very much taken with the young actor, who played the\nrole of a lady, as well as with the one who acted the buffoon, that she\ngave orders that they should be brought in; and, as she looked at them\nclosely, she felt so much the more interest in them, that she went on to\ninquire what their ages were. And when the would-be lady (replied) that\nhe was just eleven, while the would-be buffoon (explained) that he was\njust nine, the whole company gave vent for a time to expressions of\nsympathy with their lot; while dowager lady Chia bade servants bring a\nfresh supply of meats and fruits for both of them, and also gave them,\nbesides their wages, two tiaos as a present.\n\n\"This lad,\" lady Feng observed smiling, \"is when dressed up (as a girl),\na living likeness of a certain person; did you notice it just now?\"\n\nPao-ch'ai was also aware of the fact, but she simply nodded her head\nassentingly and did not say who it was. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc likewise expressed his\nassent by shaking his head, but he too did not presume to speak out.\nShih Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn, however, readily took up the conversation. \"He\nresembles,\" she interposed, \"cousin Lin's face!\" When this remark\nreached Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's ear, he hastened to cast an angry scowl at Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn,\nand to make her a sign; while the whole party, upon hearing what had\nbeen said, indulged in careful and minute scrutiny of (the lad); and as\nthey all began to laugh: \"The resemblance is indeed striking!\" they\nexclaimed.\n\nAfter a while, they parted; and when evening came Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn directed\nTs'ui L\u00c3\u00bc to pack up her clothes.\n\n\"What's the hurry?\" Ts'ui L\u00c3\u00bc asked. \"There will be ample time to pack\nup, on the day on which we go!\"\n\n\"We'll go to-morrow,\" Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn rejoined; \"for what's the use of\nremaining here any longer--to look at people's mouths and faces?\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, at these words, lost no time in pressing forward.\n\n\"My dear cousin,\" he urged; \"you're wrong in bearing me a grudge! My\ncousin Lin is a girl so very touchy, that though every one else\ndistinctly knew (of the resemblance), they wouldn't speak out; and all\nbecause they were afraid that she would get angry; but unexpectedly out\nyou came with it, at a moment when off your guard; and how ever couldn't\nshe but feel hurt? and it's because I was in dread that you would give\noffence to people that I then winked at you; and now here you are angry\nwith me; but isn't that being ungrateful to me? Had it been any one\nelse, would I have cared whether she had given offence to even ten; that\nwould have been none of my business!\"\n\nHsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn waved her hand: \"Don't,\" she added, \"come and tell me these\nflowery words and this specious talk, for I really can't come up to your\ncousin Lin. If others poke fun at her, they all do so with impunity,\nwhile if I say anything, I at once incur blame. The fact is I shouldn't\nhave spoken of her, undeserving as I am; and as she's the daughter of a\nmaster, while I'm a slave, a mere servant girl, I've heaped insult upon\nher!\"\n\n\"And yet,\" pleaded Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, full of perplexity, \"I had done it for your\nsake; and through this, I've come in for reproach. But if it were with\nan evil heart I did so, may I at once become ashes, and be trampled upon\nby ten thousands of people!\"\n\n\"In this felicitous firstmonth,\" Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn remonstrated, \"you shouldn't\ntalk so much reckless nonsense! All these worthless despicable oaths,\ndisjointed words, and corrupt language, go and tell for the benefit of\nthose mean sort of people, who in everything take pleasure in irritating\nothers, and who keep you under their thumb! But mind don't drive me to\nspit contemptuously at you.\"\n\nAs she gave utterance to these words, she betook herself in the inner\nroom of dowager lady Chia's suite of apartments, where she lay down in\nhigh dudgeon, and, as Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was so heavy at heart, he could not help\ncoming again in search of Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc; but strange to say, as soon as he put\nhis foot inside the doorway, he was speedily hustled out of it by\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc, who shut the door in his face.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc was once more unable to fathom her motives, and as he stood\noutside the window, he kept on calling out: \"My dear cousin,\" in a low\ntone of voice; but Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc paid not the slightest notice to him so that\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc became so melancholy that he drooped his head, and was plunged in\nsilence. And though Hsi Jen had, at an early hour, come to know the\ncircumstances, she could not very well at this juncture tender any\nadvice.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc remained standing in such a vacant mood that Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc imagined that\nhe had gone back; but when she came to open the door she caught sight of\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc still waiting in there; and as Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc did not feel justified to\nagain close the door, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc consequently followed her in.\n\n\"Every thing has,\" he observed, \"a why and a wherefore; which, when\nspoken out, don't even give people pain; but you will rush into a rage,\nand all without any rhyme! but to what really does it owe its rise?\"\n\n\"It's well enough, after all, for you to ask me,\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc rejoined with\nan indifferent smile, \"but I myself don't know why! But am I here to\nafford you people amusement that you will compare me to an actress, and\nmake the whole lot have a laugh at me?\"\n\n\"I never did liken you to anything,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc protested, \"neither did I\never laugh at you! and why then will you get angry with me?\"\n\n\"Was it necessary that you should have done so much as made the\ncomparison,\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc urged, \"and was there any need of even any laughter\nfrom you? why, though you mayn't have likened me to anything, or had a\nlaugh at my expense, you were, yea more dreadful than those who did\ncompare me (to a singing girl) and ridiculed me!\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc could not find anything with which to refute the argument he had\njust heard, and Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc went on to say. \"This offence can, anyhow, be\ncondoned; but, what is more, why did you also wink at Y\u00c3\u00bcn Erh? What was\nthis idea which you had resolved in your mind? wasn't it perhaps that if\nshe played with me, she would be demeaning herself, and making herself\ncheap? She's the daughter of a duke or a marquis, and we forsooth the\nmean progeny of a poor plebeian family; so that, had she diverted\nherself with me, wouldn't she have exposed herself to being depreciated,\nhad I, perchance, said anything in retaliation? This was your idea\nwasn't it? But though your purpose was, to be sure, honest enough, that\ngirl wouldn't, however, receive any favours from you, but got angry with\nyou just as much as I did; and though she made me also a tool to do you\na good turn, she, on the contrary, asserts that I'm mean by nature and\ntake pleasure in irritating people in everything! and you again were\nafraid lest she should have hurt my feelings, but, had I had a row with\nher, what would that have been to you? and had she given me any offence,\nwhat concern would that too have been of yours?\"\n\nWhen Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc heard these words, he at once became alive to the fact that\nshe too had lent an ear to the private conversation he had had a short\nwhile back with Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn: \"All because of my, fears,\" he carefully\nmused within himself, \"lest these two should have a misunderstanding, I\nwas induced to come between them, and act as a mediator; but I myself\nhave, contrary to my hopes, incurred blame and abuse on both sides! This\njust accords with what I read the other day in the Nan Hua Ching. 'The\ningenious toil, the wise are full of care; the good-for-nothing seek for\nnothing, they feed on vegetables, and roam where they list; they wander\npurposeless like a boat not made fast!' 'The mountain trees,' the text\ngoes on to say, 'lead to their own devastation; the spring (conduces) to\nits own plunder; and so on.\" And the more he therefore indulged in\nreflection, the more depressed he felt. \"Now there are only these few\ngirls,\" he proceeded to ponder minutely, \"and yet, I'm unable to treat\nthem in such a way as to promote perfect harmony; and what will I\nforsooth do by and by (when there will be more to deal with)!\"\n\nWhen he had reached this point in his cogitations, (he decided) that it\nwas really of no avail to agree with her, so that turning round, he was\nmaking his way all alone into his apartments; but Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, upon\nnoticing that he had left her side, readily concluded that reflection\nhad marred his spirits and that he had so thoroughly lost his temper as\nto be going without even giving vent to a single word, and she could not\nrestrain herself from feeling inwardly more and more irritated. \"After\nyou've gone this time,\" she hastily exclaimed, \"don't come again, even\nfor a whole lifetime; and I won't have you either so much as speak to\nme!\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc paid no heed to her, but came back to his rooms, and laying\nhimself down on his bed, he kept on muttering in a state of chagrin; and\nthough Hsi Jen knew full well the reasons of his dejection, she found it\ndifficult to summon up courage to say anything to him at the moment, and\nshe had no alternative but to try and distract him by means of\nirrelevant matters. \"The theatricals which you've seen to-day,\" she\nconsequently observed smiling, \"will again lead to performances for\nseveral days, and Miss Pao-ch'ai will, I'm sure, give a return feast.\"\n\n\"Whether she gives a return feast or not,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc rejoined with an\napathetic smirk, \"is no concern of mine!\"\n\nWhen Hsi Jen perceived the tone, so unlike that of other days, with\nwhich these words were pronounced: \"What's this that you're saying?\" she\ntherefore remarked as she gave another smile. \"In this pleasant and\npropitious first moon, when all the ladies and young ladies are in high\nglee, how is it that you're again in a mood of this sort?\"\n\n\"Whether the ladies and my cousins be in high spirits or not,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\nreplied forcing a grin, \"is also perfectly immaterial to me.\"\n\n\"They are all,\" Hsi Jen added, smilingly, \"pleasant and agreeable, and\nwere you also a little pleasant and agreeable, wouldn't it conduce to\nthe enjoyment of the whole company?\"\n\n\"What about the whole company, and they and I?\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc urged. \"They all\nhave their mutual friendships; while I, poor fellow, all forlorn, have\nnone to care a rap for me.\"\n\nHis remarks had reached this clause, when inadvertently the tears\ntrickled down; and Hsi Jen realising the state of mind he was in, did\nnot venture to say anything further. But as soon as Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had reflected\nminutely over the sense and import of this sentence, he could not\nrefrain from bursting forth into a loud fit of crying, and, turning\nhimself round, he stood up, and, drawing near the table, he took up the\npencil, and eagerly composed these enigmatical lines:\n\n  If thou wert me to test, and I were thee to test,\n  Our hearts were we to test, and our minds to test,\n  When naught more there remains for us to test\n  That will yea very well be called a test,\n  And when there's naught to put, we could say, to the test,\n  We will a place set up on which our feet to rest.\n\nAfter he had finished writing, he again gave way to fears that though he\nhimself could unfold their meaning, others, who came to peruse these\nlines, would not be able to fathom them, and he also went on\nconsequently to indite another stanza, in imitation of the \"Parasitic\nPlant,\" which he inscribed at the close of the enigma; and when he had\nread it over a second time, he felt his heart so free of all concern\nthat forthwith he got into his bed, and went to sleep.\n\nBut, who would have thought it, Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, upon seeing Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc take his\ndeparture in such an abrupt manner, designedly made use of the excuse\nthat she was bent upon finding Hsi Jen, to come round and see what he\nwas up to.\n\n\"He's gone to sleep long ago!\" Hsi Jen replied.\n\nAt these words, Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc felt inclined to betake herself back at once; but\nHsi Jen smiled and said: \"Please stop, miss. Here's a slip of paper, and\nsee what there is on it!\" and speedily taking what Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had written a\nshort while back, she handed it over to Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc to examine. Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, on\nperusal, discovered that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had composed it, at the spur of the\nmoment, when under the influence of resentment; and she could not help\nthinking it both a matter of ridicule as well as of regret; but she\nhastily explained to Hsi Jen: \"This is written for fun, and there's\nnothing of any consequence in it!\" and having concluded this remark, she\nreadily took it along with her to her room, where she conned it over in\ncompany with Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn; handing it also the next day to Pao-ch'ai to\nperuse. The burden of what Pao-ch'ai read was:\n\n  In what was no concern of mine, I should to thee have paid no heed,\n  For while I humour this, that one to please I don't succeed!\n  Act as thy wish may be! go, come whene'er thou list; 'tis naught to\n      me.\n  Sorrow or joy, without limit or bound, to indulge thou art free!\n  What is this hazy notion about relatives distant or close?\n  For what purpose have I for all these days racked my heart with woes?\n  Even at this time when I look back and think, my mind no pleasure\n      knows.\n\nAfter having finished its perusal, she went on to glance at the\nBuddhistic stanza, and smiling: \"This being,\" she soliloquised; \"has\nawakened to a sense of perception; and all through my fault, for it's\nthat ballad of mine yesterday which has incited this! But the subtle\ndevices in all these rationalistic books have a most easy tendency to\nunsettle the natural disposition, and if to-morrow he does actually get\nup, and talk a lot of insane trash, won't his having fostered this idea\nowe its origin to that ballad of mine; and shan't I have become the\nprime of all guilty people?\"\n\nSaying this, she promptly tore the paper, and, delivering the pieces to\nthe servant girls, she bade them go at once and burn them.\n\n\"You shouldn't have torn it!\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc remonstrated laughingly. \"But wait\nand I'll ask him about it! so come along all of you, and I vouch I'll\nmake him abandon that idiotic frame of mind and that depraved language.\"\n\nThe three of them crossed over, in point of fact, into Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's room,\nand Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc was the first to smile and observe. \"Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, may I ask you\nsomething? What is most valuable is a precious thing; and what is most\nfirm is jade, but what value do you possess and what firmness is innate\nin you?\"\n\nBut as Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc could not, say anything by way of reply, two of them\nremarked sneeringly: \"With all this doltish bluntness of his will he\nafter all absorb himself in abstraction?\" While Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn also clapped\nher hands and laughed, \"Cousin Pao has been discomfited.\"\n\n\"The latter part of that apothegm of yours,\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc continued, \"says:\n\n \"We would then find some place on which our feet to rest.\n\n\"Which is certainly good; but in my view, its excellence is not as yet\ncomplete! and I should still tag on two lines at its close;\" as she\nproceeded to recite:\n\n \"If we do not set up some place on which our feet to rest,\n  For peace and freedom then it will be best.\"\n\n\"There should, in very truth, be this adjunct to make it thoroughly\nexplicit!\" Pao-ch'ai added. \"In days of yore, the sixth founder of the\nSouthern sect, Hui Neng, came, when he went first in search of his\npatron, in the Shao Chou district; and upon hearing that the fifth\nfounder, Hung Jen, was at Huang Mei, he readily entered his service in\nthe capacity of Buddhist cook; and when the fifth founder, prompted by a\nwish to select a Buddhistic successor, bade his neophytes and all the\nbonzes to each compose an enigmatical stanza, the one who occupied the\nupper seat, Shen Hsiu, recited:\n\n \"A P'u T'i tree the body is, the heart so like a stand of mirror\n      bright,\n  On which must needs, by constant careful rubbing, not be left dust to\n      alight!\n\n\"And Hui Neng, who was at this time in the cook-house pounding rice,\noverheard this enigma. 'Excellent, it is excellent,' he ventured, 'but\nas far as completeness goes it isn't complete;' and having bethought\nhimself of an apothegm: 'The P'u T'i, (an expression for Buddha or\nintelligence),' he proceeded, 'is really no tree; and the resplendent\nmirror, (Buddhistic term for heart), is likewise no stand; and as, in\nfact, they do not constitute any tangible objects, how could they be\ncontaminated by particles of dust?' Whereupon the fifth founder at once\ntook his robe and clap-dish and handed them to him. Well, the text now\nof this enigma presents too this identical idea, for the simple fact is\nthat those lines full of subtleties of a short while back are not, as\nyet, perfected or brought to an issue, and do you forsooth readily give\nup the task in this manner?\"\n\n\"He hasn't been able to make any reply,\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc rejoined sneeringly,\n\"and must therefore be held to be discomfited; but were he even to make\nsuitable answer now, there would be nothing out of the common about it!\nAnyhow, from this time forth you mustn't talk about Buddhistic spells,\nfor what even we two know and are able to do, you don't as yet know and\ncan't do; and do you go and concern yourself with abstraction?\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc had, in his own mind, been under the impression that he had\nattained perception, but when he was unawares and all of a sudden\nsubjected to this question by Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, he soon found it beyond his power\nto give any ready answer. And when Pao-ch'ai furthermore came out with a\nreligious disquisition, by way of illustration, and this on subjects, in\nall of which he had hitherto not seen them display any ability, he\ncommuned within himself: \"If with their knowledge, which is indeed in\nadvance of that of mine, they haven't, as yet, attained perception, what\nneed is there for me now to bring upon myself labour and vexation?\"\n\n\"Who has, pray,\" he hastily inquired smilingly, after arriving at the\nend of his reflections, \"indulged in Buddhistic mysteries? what I did\namounts to nothing more than nonsensical trash, written, at the spur of\nthe moment, and nothing else.\"\n\nAt the close of this remark all four came to be again on the same terms\nas of old; but suddenly a servant announced that the Empress (Y\u00c3\u00bcan\nCh'un) had despatched a messenger to bring over a lantern-conundrum with\nthe directions that they should all go and guess it, and that after they\nhad found it out, they should each also devise one and send it in. At\nthese words, the four of them left the room with hasty step, and\nadjourned into dowager lady Chia's drawing room, where they discovered a\nyoung eunuch, holding a four-cornered, flat-topped lantern, of white\ngauze, which had been specially fabricated for lantern riddles. On the\nfront side, there was already a conundrum, and the whole company were\nvying with each other in looking at it and making wild guesses; when the\nyoung eunuch went on to transmit his orders, saying: \"Young ladies, you\nshould not speak out when you are guessing; but each one of you should\nsecretly write down the solutions for me to wrap them up, and take them\nall in together to await her Majesty's personal inspection as to whether\nthey be correct or not.\"\n\nUpon listening to these words, Pao-ch'ai drew near, and perceived at a\nglance, that it consisted of a stanza of four lines, with seven\ncharacters in each; but though there was no novelty or remarkable\nfeature about it, she felt constrained to outwardly give utterance to\nwords of praise. \"It's hard to guess!\" she simply added, while she\npretended to be plunged in thought, for the fact is that as soon as she\nhad cast her eye upon it, she had at once solved it. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc,\nHsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn, and T'an-ch'un, had all four also hit upon the answer, and\neach had secretly put it in writing; and Chia Huan, Chia Lan and the\nothers were at the same time sent for, and every one of them set to work\nto exert the energies of his mind, and, when they arrived at a guess,\nthey noted it down on paper; after which every individual member of the\nfamily made a choice of some object, and composed a riddle, which was\ntranscribed in a large round hand, and affixed on the lantern. This\ndone, the eunuch took his departure, and when evening drew near, he came\nout and delivered the commands of the imperial consort. \"The conundrum,\"\nhe said, \"written by Her Highness, the other day, has been solved by\nevery one, with the exception of Miss Secunda and master Tertius, who\nmade a wrong guess. Those composed by you, young ladies, have likewise\nall been guessed; but Her Majesty does not know whether her solutions\nare right or not.\" While speaking, he again produced the riddles, which\nhad been written by them, among which were those which had been solved,\nas well as those which had not been solved; and the eunuch, in like\nmanner, took the presents, conferred by the imperial consort, and handed\nthem over to those who had guessed right. To each person was assigned a\nbamboo vase, inscribed with verses, which had been manufactured for\npalace use, as well as articles of bamboo for tea; with the exception of\nYing-ch'un and Chia Huan, who were the only two persons who did not\nreceive any. But as Ying-ch'un looked upon the whole thing as a joke and\na trifle, she did not trouble her mind on that score, but Chia Huan at\nonce felt very disconsolate.\n\n\"This one devised by Mr. Tertius,\" the eunuch was further heard to say,\n\"is not properly done; and as Her Majesty herself has been unable to\nguess it she commanded me to bring it back, and ask Mr. Tertius what it\nis about.\"\n\nAfter the party had listened to these words, they all pressed forward to\nsee what had been written. The burden of it was this:\n\n  The elder brother has horns only eight;\n  The second brother has horns only two;\n  The elder brother on the bed doth sit;\n  Inside the room the second likes to squat.\n\nAfter perusal of these lines, they broke out, with one voice, into a\nloud fit of laughter; and Chia Huan had to explain to the eunuch that\nthe one was a pillow, and the other the head of an animal. Having\ncommitted the explanation to memory and accepted a cup of tea, the\neunuch took his departure; and old lady Chia, noticing in what buoyant\nspirits Y\u00c3\u00bcan Ch'un was, felt herself so much the more elated, that\nissuing forthwith directions to devise, with every despatch, a small but\ningenious lantern of fine texture in the shape of a screen, and put it\nin the Hall, she bade each of her grandchildren secretly compose a\nconundrum, copy it out clean, and affix it on the frame of the lantern;\nand she had subsequently scented tea and fine fruits, as well as every\nkind of nicknacks, got ready, as prizes for those who guessed right.\n\nAnd when Chia Cheng came from court and found the old lady in such high\nglee he also came over in the evening, as the season was furthermore\nholiday time, to avail himself of her good cheer to reap some enjoyment.\nIn the upper part of the room seated themselves, at one table dowager\nlady Chia, Chia Cheng, and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc; madame Wang, Pao-ch'ai, Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc,\nHsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn sat round another table, and Ying-ch'un, Tan-ch'un and Hsi\nCh'un the three of them, occupied a separate table, and both these\ntables were laid in the lower part, while below, all over the floor,\nstood matrons and waiting-maids for Li Kung-ts'ai and Hsi-feng were both\nseated in the inner section of the Hall, at another table.\n\nChia Chen failed to see Chia Lan, and he therefore inquired: \"How is it\nI don't see brother Lan,\" whereupon the female servants, standing below,\nhastily entered the inner room and made inquiries of widow Li. \"He\nsays,\" Mrs. Li stood up and rejoined with a smile, \"that as your master\ndidn't go just then to ask him round, he has no wish to come!\" and when\na matron delivered the reply to Chia Cheng; the whole company exclaimed\nmuch amused: \"How obstinate and perverse his natural disposition is!\"\nBut Chia Cheng lost no time in sending Chia Huan, together with two\nmatrons, to fetch Chia Lan; and, on his arrival, dowager lady Chia bade\nhim sit by her side, and, taking a handful of fruits, she gave them to\nhim to eat; after which the party chatted, laughed, and enjoyed\nthemselves.\n\nOrdinarily, there was no one but Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc to say much or talk at any\nlength, but on this day, with Chia Cheng present, his remarks were\nlimited to assents. And as to the rest, Hsiang-y\u00c3\u00bcn had, though a young\ngirl, and of delicate physique, nevertheless ever been very fond of\ntalking and discussing; but, on this instance, Chia Cheng was at the\nfeast, so that she also held her tongue and restrained her words. As for\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc she was naturally peevish and listless, and not very much\ninclined to indulge in conversation; while Pao-ch'ai, who had never been\nreckless in her words or frivolous in her deportment, likewise behaved\non the present occasion in her usual dignified manner. Hence it was that\nthis banquet, although a family party, given for the sake of relaxation,\nassumed contrariwise an appearance of restraint, and as old lady Chia\nwas herself too well aware that it was to be ascribed to the presence of\nChia Cheng alone, she therefore, after the wine had gone round three\ntimes, forthwith hurried off Chia Cheng to retire to rest.\n\nNo less cognisant was Chia Cheng himself that the old lady's motives in\npacking him off were to afford a favourable opportunity to the young\nladies and young men to enjoy themselves, and that is why, forcing a\nsmile, he observed: \"Having to-day heard that your venerable ladyship\nhad got up in here a large assortment of excellent riddles, on the\noccasion of the spring festival of lanterns, I too consequently prepared\nprizes, as well as a banquet, and came with the express purpose of\njoining the company; and why don't you in some way confer a fraction of\nthe fond love, which you cherish for your grandsons and granddaughters,\nupon me also, your son?\"\n\n\"When you're here,\" old lady Chia replied smilingly, \"they won't venture\nto chat or laugh; and unless you go, you'll really fill me with intense\ndejection! But if you feel inclined to guess conundrums, well, I'll tell\nyou one for you to solve; but if you don't guess right, mind, you'll be\nmulcted!\"\n\n\"Of course I'll submit to the penalty,\" Chia Cheng rejoined eagerly, as\nhe laughed, \"but if I do guess right, I must in like manner receive a\nreward!\"\n\n\"This goes without saying!\" dowager lady Chia added; whereupon she went\non to recite:\n\n  The monkey's body gently rests on the tree top!\n\n\"This refers,\" she said, \"to the name of a fruit.\"\n\nChia Cheng was already aware that it was a lichee, but he designedly\nmade a few guesses at random, and was fined several things; but he\nsubsequently gave, at length, the right answer, and also obtained a\npresent from her ladyship.\n\nIn due course he too set forth this conundrum for old lady Chia to\nguess:\n\n  Correct its body is in appearance,\n  Both firm and solid is it in substance;\n  To words, it is true, it cannot give vent,\n  But spoken to, it always does assent.\n\nWhen he had done reciting it, he communicated the answer in an undertone\nto Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc; and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc fathoming what his intention was, gently too told\nhis grandmother Chia, and her ladyship finding, after some reflection,\nthat there was really no mistake about it, readily remarked that it was\nan inkslab.\n\n\"After all,\" Chia Cheng smiled; \"Your venerable ladyship it is who can\nhit the right answer with one guess!\" and turning his head round, \"Be\nquick,\" he cried, \"and bring the prizes and present them!\" whereupon the\nmarried women and waiting-maids below assented with one voice, and they\nsimultaneously handed up the large trays and small boxes.\n\nOld lady Chia passed the things, one by one, under inspection; and\nfinding that they consisted of various kinds of articles, novel and\ningenious, of use and of ornament, in vogue during the lantern festival,\nher heart was so deeply elated that with alacrity she shouted, \"Pour a\nglass of wine for your master!\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc took hold of the decanter, while Ying Ch'un presented the cup of\nwine.\n\n\"Look on that screen!\" continued dowager lady Chia, \"all those riddles\nhave been written by the young ladies; so go and guess them for my\nbenefit!\"\n\nChia Cheng signified his obedience, and rising and walking up to the\nfront of the screen, he noticed the first riddle, which was one composed\nby the Imperial consort Y\u00c3\u00bcan, in this strain:\n\n  The pluck of devils to repress in influence it abounds,\n  Like bound silk is its frame, and like thunder its breath resounds.\n  But one report rattles, and men are lo! in fear and dread;\n  Transformed to ashes 'tis what time to see you turn the head.\n\n\"Is this a cracker?\" Chia Cheng inquired.\n\n\"It is,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc assented.\n\nChia Cheng then went on to peruse that of Ying-Ch'un's, which referred\nto an article of use:\n\n  Exhaustless is the principle of heavenly calculations and of human\n      skill;\n  Skill may exist, but without proper practice the result to find hard\n      yet\n  will be!\n  Whence cometh all this mixed confusion on a day so still?\n  Simply it is because the figures Yin and Yang do not agree.\n\n\"It's an abacus,\" Chia Cheng observed.\n\n\"Quite so!\" replied Ying Ch'un smiling; after which they also conned the\none below, by T'an-ch'un, which ran thus and had something to do with an\nobject:\n\n  This is the time when 'neath the stairs the pages their heads raise!\n  The term of \"pure brightness\" is the meetest time this thing to make!\n  The vagrant silk it snaps, and slack, without tension it strays!\n  The East wind don't begrudge because its farewell it did take!\n\n\"It would seem,\" Chia Cheng suggested, \"as if that must be a kite!\"\n\n\"It is,\" answered T'an C'h'un; whereupon Chia Cheng read the one below,\nwhich was written by Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc to this effect and bore upon some thing:\n\n  After the audience, his two sleeves who brings with fumes replete?\n  Both by the lute and in the quilt, it lacks luck to abide!\n  The dawn it marks; reports from cock and man renders effete!\n  At midnight, maids no trouble have a new one to provide!\n  The head, it glows during the day, as well as in the night!\n  Its heart, it burns from day to day and 'gain from year to year!\n  Time swiftly flies and mete it is that we should hold it dear!\n  Changes might come, but it defies wind, rain, days dark or bright!\n\n\"Isn't this a scented stick to show the watch?\" Chia Cheng inquired.\n\n\"Yes!\" assented Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, speaking on Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc's behalf; and Chia Cheng\nthereupon prosecuted the perusal of a conundrum, which ran as follows,\nand referred to an object;\n\n  With the South, it sits face to face,\n  And the North, the while, it doth face;\n  If the figure be sad, it also is sad,\n  If the figure be glad, it likewise is glad!\n\n\"Splendid! splendid!\" exclaimed Chia Cheng, \"my guess is that it's a\nlooking-glass. It's excellently done!\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc smiled. \"It is a looking glass!\" he rejoined.\n\n\"This is, however, anonymous; whose work is it?\" Chia Cheng went on to\nask, and dowager lady Chia interposed: \"This, I fancy, must have been\ncomposed by Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc,\" and Chia Cheng then said not a word, but continued\nreading the following conundrum, which was that devised by Pao-ch'ai, on\nsome article or other:\n\n  Eyes though it has; eyeballs it has none, and empty 'tis inside!\n  The lotus flowers out of the water peep, and they with gladness meet,\n  But when dryandra leaves begin to drop, they then part and divide,\n  For a fond pair they are, but, united, winter they cannot greet.\n\nWhen Chia Cheng finished scanning it, he gave way to reflection. \"This\nobject,\" he pondered, \"must surely be limited in use! But for persons of\ntender years to indulge in all this kind of language, would seem to be\nstill less propitious; for they cannot, in my views, be any of them the\nsort of people to enjoy happiness and longevity!\" When his reflections\nreached this point, he felt the more dejected, and plainly betrayed a\nsad appearance, and all he did was to droop his head and to plunge in a\nbrown study.\n\nBut upon perceiving the frame of mind in which Chia Cheng was, dowager\nlady Chia arrived at the conclusion that he must be fatigued; and\nfearing, on the other hand, that if she detained him, the whole party of\nyoung ladies would lack the spirit to enjoy themselves, she there and\nthen faced Chia Cheng and suggested: \"There's no need really for you to\nremain here any longer, and you had better retire to rest; and let us\nsit a while longer; after which, we too will break up!\"\n\nAs soon as Chia Cheng caught this hint, he speedily assented several\nconsecutive yes's; and when he had further done his best to induce old\nlady Chia to have a cup of wine, he eventually withdrew out of the Hall.\nOn his return to his bedroom, he could do nothing else than give way to\ncogitation, and, as he turned this and turned that over in his mind, he\ngot still more sad and pained.\n\n\"Amuse yourselves now!\" readily exclaimed dowager lady Chia, during this\nwhile, after seeing Chia Cheng off; but this remark was barely finished,\nwhen she caught sight of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc run up to the lantern screen, and give\nvent, as he gesticulated with his hands and kicked his feet about, to\nany criticisms that first came to his lips. \"In this,\" he remarked,\n\"this line isn't happy; and that one, hasn't been suitably solved!\"\nwhile he behaved just like a monkey, whose fetters had been let loose.\n\n\"Were the whole party after all,\" hastily ventured Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, \"to sit down,\nas we did a short while back and chat and laugh; wouldn't that be more\nin accordance with good manners?\"\n\nLady Feng thereupon egressed from the room in the inner end and\ninterposed her remarks. \"Such a being as you are,\" she said, \"shouldn't\nsurely be allowed by Mr. Chia Cheng, an inch or a step from his side,\nand then you'll be all right. But just then it slipped my memory, for\nwhy didn't I, when your father was present, instigate him to bid you\ncompose a rhythmical enigma; and you would, I have no doubt, have been\nup to this moment in a state of perspiration!\"\n\nAt these words, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc lost all patience, and laying hold of lady Feng,\nhe hustled her about for a few moments.\n\nBut old lady Chia went on for some time to bandy words with Li\nKung-ts'ai, with the whole company of young ladies and the rest, so that\nshe, in fact, felt considerably tired and worn out; and when she heard\nthat the fourth watch had already drawn nigh, she consequently issued\ndirections that the eatables should be cleared away and given to the\ncrowd of servants, and suggested, as she readily rose to her feet, \"Let\nus go and rest! for the next day is also a feast, and we must get up at\nan early hour; and to-morrow evening we can enjoy ourselves again!\"\nwhereupon the whole company dispersed.\n\nBut now, reader, listen to the sequel given in the chapter which\nfollows.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n  Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc and Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc make use of some beautiful passages from the Record\n      of the Western Side-building to bandy jokes.\n  The excellent ballads sung in the Peony Pavilion touch the tender\n      heart of Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc.\n\n\nSoon after the day on which Chia Yuan-ch'un honoured the garden of Broad\nVista with a visit, and her return to the Palace, so our story goes, she\nforthwith desired that T'an-ch'un should make a careful copy, in\nconsecutive order, of the verses, which had been composed and read out\non that occasion, in order that she herself should assign them their\nrank, and adjudge the good and bad. And she also directed that an\ninscription should be engraved on a stone, in the Broad Vista park, to\nserve in future years as a record of the pleasant and felicitous event;\nand Chia Cheng, therefore, gave orders to servants to go far and wide,\nand select skilful artificers and renowned workmen, to polish the stone\nand engrave the characters in the garden of Broad Vista; while Chia Chen\nput himself at the head of Chia Jung, Chia P'ing and others to\nsuperintend the work. And as Chia Se had, on the other hand, the control\nof Wen Kuan and the rest of the singing girls, twelve in all, as well as\nof their costumes and other properties, he had no leisure to attend to\nanything else, and consequently once again sent for Chia Ch'ang and Chia\nLing to come and act as overseers.\n\nOn a certain day, the works were taken in hand for rubbing the stones\nsmooth with wax, for carving the inscription, and tracing it with\nvermilion, but without entering into details on these matters too\nminutely, we will return to the two places, the Yu Huang temple and the\nTa Mo monastery. The company of twelve young bonzes and twelve young\nTaoist priests had now moved out of the Garden of Broad Vista, and Chia\nCheng was meditating upon distributing them to various temples to live\napart, when unexpectedly Chia Ch'in's mother, n\u00c3\u00a9e Chou,--who resided in\nthe back street, and had been at the time contemplating to pay a visit\nto Chia Cheng on this side so as to obtain some charge, be it either\nlarge or small, for her son to look after, that he too should be put in\nthe way of turning up some money to meet his expenses with,--came, as\nluck would have it, to hear that some work was in hand in this mansion,\nand lost no time in driving over in a curricle and making her appeal to\nlady Feng. And as lady Feng remembered that she had all along not\npresumed on her position to put on airs, she willingly acceded to her\nrequest, and after calling to memory some suitable remarks, she at once\nwent to make her report to madame Wang: \"These young bonzes and Taoist\npriests,\" she said, \"can by no means be sent over to other places; for\nwere the Imperial consort to come out at an unexpected moment, they\nwould then be required to perform services; and in the event of their\nbeing scattered, there will, when the time comes to requisition their\nhelp, again be difficulties in the way; and my idea is that it would be\nbetter to send them all to the family temple, the Iron Fence Temple; and\nevery month all there will be to do will be to depute some one to take\nover a few taels for them to buy firewood and rice with, that's all, and\nwhen there's even a sound of their being required uttered, some one can\nat once go and tell them just one word 'come,' and they will come\nwithout the least trouble!\"\n\nMadame Wang gave a patient ear to this proposal, and, in due course,\nconsulted with Chia Cheng.\n\n\"You've really,\" smiled Chia Cheng at these words, \"reminded me how I\nshould act! Yes, let this be done!\" And there and then he sent for Chia\nLien.\n\nChia Lien was, at the time, having his meal with lady Feng, but as soon\nas he heard that he was wanted, he put by his rice and was just walking\noff, when lady Feng clutched him and pulled him back. \"Wait a while,\"\nshe observed with a smirk, \"and listen to what I've got to tell you! if\nit's about anything else, I've nothing to do with it; but if it be about\nthe young bonzes and young Taoists, you must, in this particular matter,\nplease comply with this suggestion of mine,\" after which, she went on in\nthis way and that way to put him up to a whole lot of hints.\n\n\"I know nothing about it,\" Chia Lien rejoined smilingly, \"and as you\nhave the knack you yourself had better go and tell him!\"\n\nBut as soon as lady Feng heard this remark, she stiffened her head and\nthrew down the chopsticks; and, with an expression on her cheeks, which\nlooked like a smile and yet not a smile, she glanced angrily at Chia\nLien. \"Are you speaking in earnest,\" she inquired, \"or are you only\njesting?\"\n\n\"Y\u00c3\u00bcn Erh, the son of our fifth sister-in-law of the western porch, has\ncome and appealed to me two or three times, asking for something to look\nafter,\" Chia Lien laughed, \"and I assented and bade him wait; and now,\nafter a great deal of trouble, this job has turned up; and there you are\nonce again snatching it away!\"\n\n\"Compose your mind,\" lady Feng observed grinning, \"for the Imperial\nConsort has hinted that directions should be given for the planting, in\nthe north-east corner of the park, of a further plentiful supply of pine\nand cedar trees, and that orders should also be issued for the addition,\nround the base of the tower, of a large number of flowers and plants and\nsuch like; and when this job turns up, I can safely tell you that Yun\nErh will be called to assume control of these works.\"\n\n\"Well if that be really so,\" Chia Lien rejoined, \"it will after all do!\nBut there's only one thing; all I was up to last night was simply to\nhave some fun with you, but you obstinately and perversely wouldn't.\"\n\nLady Feng, upon hearing these words, burst out laughing with a sound of\nCh'ih, and spurting disdainfully at Chia Lien, she lowered her head and\nwent on at once with her meal; during which time Chia Lien speedily\nwalked away laughing the while, and betook himself to the front, where\nhe saw Chia Cheng. It was, indeed, about the young bonzes, and Chia Lien\nreadily carried out lady Feng's suggestion. \"As from all appearances,\"\nhe continued, \"Ch'in Erh has, actually, so vastly improved, this job\nshould, after all, be entrusted to his care and management; and provided\nthat in observance with the inside custom Ch'in Erh were each day told\nto receive the advances, things will go on all right.\" And as Chia Cheng\nhad never had much attention to give to such matters of detail, he, as\nsoon as he heard what Chia Lien had to say, immediately signified his\napproval and assent. And Chia Lien, on his return to his quarters,\ncommunicated the issue to lady Feng; whereupon lady Feng at once sent\nsome one to go and notify dame Chou.\n\nChia Ch'in came, in due course, to pay a visit to Chia Lien and his\nwife, and was incessant in his expressions of gratitude; and lady Feng\nbestowed upon him a further favour by giving him, as a first instalment,\nan advance of the funds necessary for three months' outlay, for which\nshe bade him write a receipt; while Chia Lien filled up a cheque and\nsigned it; and a counter-order was simultaneously issued, and he came\nout into the treasury where the sum specified for three months'\nsupplies, amounting to three hundred taels, was paid out in pure ingots.\n\nChia Ch'in took the first piece of silver that came under his hand, and\ngave it to the men in charge of the scales, with which he told them to\nhave a cup of tea, and bidding, shortly after, a boy-servant take the\nmoney to his home, he held consultation with his mother; after which, he\nhired a donkey for himself to ride on, and also bespoke several\ncarriages, and came to the back gate of the Jung Kuo mansion; where\nhaving called out the twenty young priests, they got into the carriages,\nand sped straightway beyond the city walls, to the Temple of the Iron\nFence, where nothing of any note transpired at the time.\n\nBut we will now notice Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcan-ch'un, within the precincts of the\nPalace. When she had arranged the verses composed in the park of Broad\nVista in their order of merit, she suddenly recollected that the sights\nin the garden were sure, ever since her visit through them, to be\ndiligently and respectfully kept locked up by her father and mother; and\nthat by not allowing any one to go in was not an injustice done to this\ngarden? \"Besides,\" (she pondered), \"in that household, there are at\npresent several young ladies, capable of composing odes, and able to\nwrite poetry, and why should not permission be extended to them to go\nand take their quarters in it; in order too that those winsome persons\nmight not be deprived of good cheer, and that the flowers and willows\nmay not lack any one to admire them!\"\n\nBut remembering likewise that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had from his infancy grown up among\nthat crowd of female cousins, and was such a contrast to the rest of his\nmale cousins that were he not allowed to move into it, he would, she\nalso apprehended, be made to feel forlorn; and dreading lest his\ngrandmother and his mother should be displeased at heart, she thought it\nimperative that he too should be permitted to take up his quarters\ninside, so that things should be put on a satisfactory footing; and\ndirecting the eunuch Hsia Chung to go to the Jung mansion and deliver\nher commands, she expressed the wish that Pao-ch'ai and the other girls\nshould live in the garden and that it should not be kept closed, and\nurged that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc should also shift into it, at his own pleasure, for\nthe prosecution of his studies. And Chia Cheng and madame Wang, upon\nreceiving her commands, hastened, after the departure of Hsia Chung, to\nexplain them to dowager lady Chia, and to despatch servants into the\ngarden to tidy every place, to dust, to sweep, and to lay out the\nportieres and bed-curtains. The tidings were heard by the rest even with\nperfect equanimity, but Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was immoderately delighted; and he was\nengaged in deliberation with dowager lady Chia as to this necessary and\nto that requirement, when suddenly they descried a waiting-maid arrive,\nwho announced: \"Master wishes to see Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc gazed vacantly for a while. His spirits simultaneously were swept\naway; his countenance changed colour; and clinging to old lady Chia, he\nreadily wriggled her about, just as one would twist the sugar (to make\nsweetmeats with), and could not, for the very death of him, summon up\ncourage to go; so that her ladyship had no alternative but to try and\nreassure him. \"My precious darling\" she urged, \"just you go, and I'll\nstand by you! He won't venture to be hard upon you; and besides, you've\ndevised these excellent literary compositions; and I presume as Her\nMajesty has desired that you should move into the garden, his object is\nto give you a few words of advice; simply because he fears that you\nmight be up to pranks in those grounds. But to all he tells you,\nwhatever you do, mind you acquiesce and it will be all right!\"\n\nAnd as she tried to compose him, she at the same time called two old\nnurses and enjoined them to take Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc over with due care, \"And don't\nlet his father,\" she added, \"frighten him!\"\n\nThe old nurses expressed their obedience, and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc felt constrained to\nwalk ahead; and with one step scarcely progressing three inches, he\nleisurely came over to this side. Strange coincidence Chia Cheng was in\nmadame Wang's apartments consulting with her upon some matter or other,\nand Chin Ch'uan-erh, Ts'ai Yun, Ts'ai Feng, Ts'ai Luan, Hsiu Feng and\nthe whole number of waiting-maids were all standing outside under the\nverandah. As soon as they caught sight of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, they puckered up their\nmouths and laughed at him; while Chin Ch'uan grasped Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc with one\nhand, and remarked in a low tone of voice: \"On these lips of mine has\njust been rubbed cosmetic, soaked with perfume, and are you now inclined\nto lick it or not?\" whereupon Ts'ai Y\u00c3\u00bcn pushed off Chin Ch'uan with one\nshove, as she interposed laughingly, \"A person's heart is at this moment\nin low spirits and do you still go on cracking jokes at him? But avail\nyourself of this opportunity when master is in good cheer to make haste\nand get in!\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc had no help but to sidle against the door and walk in. Chia Cheng\nand madame Wang were, in fact, both in the inner rooms, and dame Chou\nraised the porti\u00c3\u00a8re. Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc stepped in gingerly and perceived Chia Cheng\nand madame Wang sitting opposite to each other, on the stove-couch,\nengaged in conversation; while below on a row of chairs sat Ying Ch'un,\nT'an Ch'un, Hsi Ch'un and Chia Huan; but though all four of them were\nseated in there only T'an Ch'un, Hsi Ch'un and Chia Huan rose to their\nfeet, as soon as they saw him make his appearance in the room; and when\nChia Cheng raised his eyes and noticed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc standing in front of him,\nwith a gait full of ease and with those winsome looks of his, so\ncaptivating, he once again realised what a mean being Chia Huan was, and\nhow coarse his deportment. But suddenly he also bethought himself of\nChia Chu, and as he reflected too that madame Wang had only this son of\nher own flesh and blood, upon whom she ever doated as upon a gem, and\nthat his own beard had already begun to get hoary, the consequence was\nthat he unwittingly stifled, well nigh entirely, the feeling of hatred\nand dislike, which, during the few recent years he had ordinarily\nfostered towards Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. And after a long pause, \"Her Majesty,\" he\nobserved, \"bade you day after day ramble about outside to disport\nyourself, with the result that you gradually became remiss and lazy; but\nnow her desire is that we should keep you under strict control, and that\nin prosecuting your studies in the company of your cousins in the\ngarden, you should carefully exert your brains to learn; so that if you\ndon't again attend to your duties, and mind your regular tasks, you had\nbetter be on your guard!\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc assented several consecutive yes's;\nwhereupon madame Wang drew him by her side and made him sit down, and\nwhile his three cousins resumed the seats they previously occupied:\n\"Have you finished all the pills you had been taking a short while\nback?\" madame Wang inquired, as she rubbed Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's neck.\n\n\"There's still one pill remaining,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc explained by way of reply.\n\n\"You had better,\" madame Wang added, \"fetch ten more pills tomorrow\nmorning; and every day about bedtime tell Hsi Jen to give them to you;\nand when you've had one you can go to sleep!\"\n\n\"Ever since you, mother, bade me take them,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc rejoined, \"Hsi Jen\nhas daily sent me one, when I was about to turn in.\"\n\n\"Who's this called Hsi Jen?\" Chia Chen thereupon ascertained.\n\n\"She's a waiting-maid!\" madame Wang answered.\n\n\"A servant girl,\" Chia Cheng remonstrated, \"can be called by whatever\nname one chooses; anything is good enough; but who's it who has started\nthis kind of pretentious name!\"\n\nMadame Wang noticed that Chia Cheng was not in a happy frame of mind, so\nthat she forthwith tried to screen matters for Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, by saying: \"It's\nour old lady who has originated it!\"\n\n\"How can it possibly be,\" Chia Cheng exclaimed, \"that her ladyship knows\nanything about such kind of language? It must, for a certainty, be\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc!\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc perceiving that he could not conceal the truth from him, was\nunder the necessity of standing up and of explaining; \"As I have all\nalong read verses, I remembered the line written by an old poet:\n\n \"What time the smell of flowers wafts itself into man, one knows the\n      day is warm.\n\n\"And as this waiting-maid's surname was Hua (flower), I readily gave her\nthe name, on the strength of this sentiment.\"\n\n\"When you get back,\" madame Wang speedily suggested addressing Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc,\n\"change it and have done; and you, sir, needn't lose your temper over\nsuch a trivial matter!\"\n\n\"It doesn't really matter in the least,\" Chia Cheng continued; \"so that\nthere's no necessity of changing it; but it's evident that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\ndoesn't apply his mind to legitimate pursuits, but mainly devotes his\nenergies to such voluptuous expressions and wanton verses!\" And as he\nfinished these words, he abruptly shouted out: \"You brute-like child of\nretribution! Don't you yet get out of this?\"\n\n\"Get away, off with you!\" madame Wang in like manner hastened to urge;\n\"our dowager lady is waiting, I fear, for you to have her repast!\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc assented, and, with gentle step, he withdrew out of the room,\nlaughing at Chin Ch'uan-erh, as he put out his tongue; and leading off\nthe two nurses, he went off on his way like a streak of smoke. But no\nsooner had he reached the door of the corridor than he espied Hsi Jen\nstanding leaning against the side; who perceiving Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc come back safe\nand sound heaped smile upon smile, and asked: \"What did he want you\nfor?\"\n\n\"There was nothing much,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc explained, \"he simply feared that I\nwould, when I get into the garden, be up to mischief, and he gave me all\nsorts of advice;\" and, as while he explained matters, they came into the\npresence of lady Chia, he gave her a clear account, from first to last,\nof what had transpired. But when he saw that Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc was at the\nmoment in the room, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc speedily inquired of her: \"Which place do you\nthink best to live in?\"\n\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc had just been cogitating on this subject, so that when she\nunexpectedly heard Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's inquiry, she forthwith rejoined with a\nsmile: \"My own idea is that the Hsio Hsiang Kuan is best; for I'm fond\nof those clusters of bamboos, which hide from view the tortuous\nbalustrade and make the place more secluded and peaceful than any\nother!\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc at these words clapped his hands and smiled. \"That just meets\nwith my own views!\" he remarked; \"I too would like you to go and live in\nthere; and as I am to stay in the I Hung Yuan, we two will be, in the\nfirst place, near each other; and next, both in quiet and secluded\nspots.\"\n\nWhile the two of them were conversing, a servant came, sent over by Chia\nCheng, to report to dowager lady Chia that: \"The 22nd of the second moon\nwas a propitious day for Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc and the young ladies to shift their\nquarters into the garden; that during these few days, servants should be\nsent in to put things in their proper places and to clean; that Hsueh\nPao-ch'ai should put up in the Heng Wu court; that Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc was to\nlive in the Hsiao Hsiang lodge; that Chia Ying-ch'un should move into\nthe Cho Chin two-storied building; that T'an Ch'un should put up in the\nCh'iu Yen library; that Hsi Ch'un should take up her quarters in the\nLiao Feng house; that widow Li should live in the Tao Hsiang village,\nand that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was to live in the I Hung court. That at every place two\nold nurses should be added and four servant-girls; that exclusive of the\nnurse and personal waiting-maid of each, there should, in addition, be\nservants, whose special duties should be to put things straight and to\nsweep the place; and that on the 22nd, they should all, in a body, move\ninto the garden.\"\n\nWhen this season drew near, the interior of the grounds, with the\nflowers waving like embroidered sashes, and the willows fanned by the\nfragrant breeze, was no more as desolate and silent as it had been in\nprevious days; but without indulging in any further irrelevant details,\nwe shall now go back to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc.\n\nEver since he shifted his quarters into the park, his heart was full of\njoy, and his mind of contentment, fostering none of those extraordinary\nideas, whose tendency could be to give birth to longings and hankerings.\nDay after day, he simply indulged, in the company of his female cousins\nand the waiting-maids, in either reading his books, or writing\ncharacters, or in thrumming the lute, playing chess, drawing pictures\nand scanning verses, even in drawing patterns of argus pheasants, in\nembroidering phoenixes, contesting with them in searching for strange\nplants, and gathering flowers, in humming poetry with gentle tone,\nsinging ballads with soft voice, dissecting characters, and in playing\nat mora, so that, being free to go everywhere and anywhere, he was of\ncourse completely happy. From his pen emanate four ballads on the times\nof the four seasons, which, although they could not be looked upon as\nfirst-rate, afford anyhow a correct idea of his sentiments, and a true\naccount of the scenery.\n\nThe ballad on the spring night runs as follows:\n\n  The silken curtains, thin as russet silk, at random are spread out.\n  The croak of frogs from the adjoining lane but faintly strikes the\n      ear.\n  The pillow a slight chill pervades, for rain outside the window falls.\n  The landscape, which now meets the eye, is like that seen in dreams by\n      man.\n  In plenteous streams the candles' tears do drop, but for whom do they\n      weep?\n  Each particle of grief felt by the flowers is due to anger against me.\n  It's all because the maids have by indulgence indolent been made.\n  The cover over me I'll pull, as I am loth to laugh and talk for long.\n\nThis is the description of the aspect of nature on a summer night:\n\n  The beauteous girl, weary of needlework, quiet is plunged in a long\n      dream.\n  The parrot in the golden cage doth shout that it is time the tea to\n      brew.\n  The lustrous windows with the musky moon like open palace-mirrors\n      look;\n  The room abounds with fumes of sandalwood and all kinds of imperial\n      scents.\n  From the cups made of amber is poured out the slippery dew from the\n      lotus.\n  The banisters of glass, the cool zephyr enjoy flapped by the willow\n      trees.\n  In the stream-spanning kiosk, the curtains everywhere all at one time\n      do wave.\n  In the vermilion tower the blinds the maidens roll, for they have made\n      the night's toilette.\n\nThe landscape of an autumnal evening is thus depicted:\n\n  In the interior of the Chiang Y\u00c3\u00bcn house are hushed all clamorous din\n      and noise.\n  The sheen, which from Selene flows, pervades the windows of carnation\n      gauze.\n  The moss-locked, streaked rocks shelter afford to the cranes, plunged\n      in sleep.\n  The dew, blown on the t'ung tree by the well, doth wet the roosting\n      rooks.\n  Wrapped in a quilt, the maid comes the gold phoenix coverlet to\n      spread.\n  The girl, who on the rails did lean, on her return drops the\n      kingfisher flowers!\n  This quiet night his eyes in sleep he cannot close, as he doth long\n      for wine.\n  The smoke is stifled, and the fire restirred, when tea is ordered to\n      be brewed.\n\nThe picture of a winter night is in this strain:\n\n  The sleep of the plum trees, the dream of the bamboos the third watch\n      have already reached.\n  Under the embroidered quilt and the kingfisher coverlet one can't\n      sleep for the cold.\n  The shadow of fir trees pervades the court, but cranes are all that\n      meet the eye.\n  Both far and wide the pear blossom covers the ground, but yet the hawk\n      cannot be heard.\n  The wish, verses to write, fostered by the damsel with the green\n      sleeves, has wax\u00c3\u00a9d cold.\n  The master, with the gold sable pelisse, cannot endure much wine.\n  But yet he doth rejoice that his attendant knows the way to brew the\n      tea.\n  The newly-fallen snow is swept what time for tea the water must be\n      boiled.\n\nBut putting aside Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, as he leisurely was occupied in scanning some\nverses, we will now allude to all these ballads. There lived, at that\ntime, a class of people, whose wont was to servilely court the\ninfluential and wealthy, and who, upon perceiving that the verses were\ncomposed by a young lad of the Jung Kuo mansion, of only twelve or\nthirteen years of age, had copies made, and taking them outside sang\ntheir praise far and wide. There were besides another sort of\nlight-headed young men, whose heart was so set upon licentious and\nseductive lines, that they even inscribed them on fans and screen-walls,\nand time and again kept on humming them and extolling them. And to the\nabove reasons must therefore be ascribed the fact that persons came in\nsearch of stanzas and in quest of manuscripts, to apply for sketches and\nto beg for poetical compositions, to the increasing satisfaction of\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, who day after day, when at home, devoted his time and attention\nto these extraneous matters. But who would have anticipated that he\ncould ever in his quiet seclusion have become a prey to a spirit of\nrestlessness? Of a sudden, one day he began to feel discontent, finding\nfault with this and turning up his nose at that; and going in and coming\nout he was simply full of ennui. And as all the girls in the garden were\njust in the prime of youth, and at a time of life when, artless and\nunaffected, they sat and reclined without regard to retirement, and\ndisported themselves and joked without heed, how could they ever have\ncome to read the secrets which at this time occupied a place in the\nheart of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc? But so unhappy was Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc within himself that he soon\nfelt loth to stay in the garden, and took to gadding about outside like\nan evil spirit; but he behaved also the while in an idiotic manner.\n\nMing Yen, upon seeing him go on in this way, felt prompted, with the\nidea of affording his mind some distraction, to think of this and to\ndevise that expedient; but everything had been indulged in with surfeit\nby Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, and there was only this resource, (that suggested itself to\nhim,) of which Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had not as yet had any experience. Bringing his\nreflections to a close, he forthwith came over to a bookshop, and\nselecting novels, both of old and of the present age, traditions\nintended for outside circulation on Fei Yen, Ho Te, Wu Tse-t'ien, and\nYang Kuei-fei, as well as books of light literature consisting of\nstrange legends, he purchased a good number of them with the express\npurpose of enticing Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc to read them. As soon as Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc caught sight\nof them, he felt as if he had obtained some gem or jewel. \"But you\nmustn't,\" Ming Yen went on to enjoin him, \"take them into the garden;\nfor if any one were to come to know anything about them, I shall then\nsuffer more than I can bear; and you should, when you go along, hide\nthem in your clothes!\"\n\nBut would Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc agree to not introducing them into the garden? So after\nmuch wavering, he picked out only several volumes of those whose style\nwas more refined, and took them in, and threw them over the top of his\nbed for him to peruse when no one was present; while those coarse and\nvery indecent ones, he concealed in a bundle in the outer library.\n\nOn one day, which happened to be the middle decade of the third moon,\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, after breakfast, took a book, the \"Hui Chen Chi,\" in his hand\nand walked as far as the bridge of the Hsin Fang lock. Seating himself\non a block of rock, that lay under the peach trees in that quarter, he\nopened the Hui Chen Chi and began to read it carefully from the\nbeginning. But just as he came to the passage: \"the falling red\n(flowers) have formed a heap,\" he felt a gust of wind blow through the\ntrees, bringing down a whole bushel of peach blossoms; and, as they\nfell, his whole person, the entire surface of the book as well as a\nlarge extent of ground were simply bestrewn with petals of the blossoms.\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc was bent upon shaking them down; but as he feared lest they\nshould be trodden under foot, he felt constrained to carry the petals in\nhis coat and walk to the bank of the pond and throw them into the\nstream. The petals floated on the surface of the water, and, after\nwhirling and swaying here and there, they at length ran out by the Hsin\nFang lock. But, on his return under the tree, he found the ground again\none mass of petals, and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was just hesitating what to do, when he\nheard some one behind his back inquire, \"What are you up to here?\" and\nas soon as Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc turned his head round, he discovered that it was Lin\nTai-y\u00c3\u00bc, who had come over carrying on her shoulder a hoe for raking\nflowers, that on this hoe was suspended a gauze-bag, and that in her\nhand she held a broom.\n\n\"That's right, well done!\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc remarked smiling; \"come and sweep\nthese flowers, and throw them into the water yonder. I've just thrown a\nlot in there myself!\"\n\n\"It isn't right,\" Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc rejoined, \"to throw them into the water.\nThe water, which you see, is clean enough here, but as soon as it finds\nits way out, where are situated other people's grounds, what isn't there\nin it? so that you would be misusing these flowers just as much as if\nyou left them here! But in that corner, I have dug a hole for flowers,\nand I'll now sweep these and put them into this gauze-bag and bury them\nin there; and, in course of many days, they will also become converted\ninto earth, and won't this be a clean way (of disposing of them)?\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc, after listening to these words, felt inexpressibly delighted.\n\"Wait!\" he smiled, \"until I put down my book, and I'll help you to clear\nthem up!\"\n\n\"What's the book?\" Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc inquired.\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc at this question was so taken aback that he had no time to\nconceal it. \"It's,\" he replied hastily, \"the Chung Yung and the Ta\nHs\u00c3\u00bceh!\"\n\n\"Are you going again to play the fool with me? Be quick and give it to\nme to see; and this will be ever so much better a way!\"\n\n\"Cousin,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc replied, \"as far as you yourself are concerned I don't\nmind you, but after you've seen it, please don't tell any one else. It's\nreally written in beautiful style; and were you to once begin reading\nit, why even for your very rice you wouldn't have a thought?\"\n\nAs he spoke, he handed it to her; and Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc deposited all the flowers\non the ground, took over the book, and read it from the very first page;\nand the more she perused it, she got so much the more fascinated by it,\nthat in no time she had finished reading sixteen whole chapters. But\naroused as she was to a state of rapture by the diction, what remained\neven of the fascination was enough to overpower her senses; and though\nshe had finished reading, she nevertheless continued in a state of\nabstraction, and still kept on gently recalling the text to mind, and\nhumming it to herself.\n\n\"Cousin, tell me is it nice or not?\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc grinned.\n\n\"It is indeed full of zest!\" Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc replied exultingly.\n\n\"I'm that very sad and very sickly person,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc explained laughing,\n\"while you are that beauty who could subvert the empire and overthrow\nthe city.\"\n\nLin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc became, at these words, unconsciously crimson all over her\ncheeks, even up to her very ears; and raising, at the same moment, her\ntwo eyebrows, which seemed to knit and yet not to knit, and opening wide\nthose eyes, which seemed to stare and yet not to stare, while her\npeach-like cheeks bore an angry look and on her thin-skinned face lurked\ndispleasure, she pointed at Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc and exclaimed: \"You do deserve death,\nfor the rubbish you talk! without any provocation you bring up these\nlicentious expressions and wanton ballads to give vent to all this\ninsolent rot, in order to insult me; but I'll go and tell uncle and\naunt.\"\n\nAs soon as she pronounced the two words \"insult me,\" her eyeballs at\nonce were suffused with purple, and turning herself round she there and\nthen walked away; which filled Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc with so much distress that he\njumped forward to impede her progress, as he pleaded: \"My dear cousin, I\nearnestly entreat you to spare me this time! I've indeed said what I\nshouldn't; but if I had any intention to insult you, I'll throw myself\nto-morrow into the pond, and let the scabby-headed turtle eat me up, so\nthat I become transformed into a large tortoise. And when you shall have\nby and by become the consort of an officer of the first degree, and you\nshall have fallen ill from old age and returned to the west, I'll come\nto your tomb and bear your stone tablet for ever on my back!\"\n\nAs he uttered these words, Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc burst out laughing with a sound of\n\"pu ch'ih,\" and rubbing her eyes, she sneeringly remarked: \"I too can\ncome out with this same tune; but will you now still go on talking\nnonsense? Pshaw! you're, in very truth, like a spear-head, (which looks)\nlike silver, (but is really soft as) wax!\"\n\n\"Go on, go on!\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc smiled after this remark; \"and what you've said,\nI too will go and tell!\"\n\n\"You maintain,\" Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc rejoined sarcastically, \"that after glancing\nat anything you're able to recite it; and do you mean to say that I\ncan't even do so much as take in ten lines with one gaze?\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc smiled and put his book away, urging: \"Let's do what's right and\nproper, and at once take the flowers and bury them; and don't let us\nallude to these things!\"\n\nForthwith the two of them gathered the fallen blossoms; but no sooner\nhad they interred them properly than they espied Hsi Jen coming, who\nwent on to observe: \"Where haven't I looked for you? What! have you\nfound your way as far as this! But our senior master, Mr. Chia She, over\nthere isn't well; and the young ladies have all gone over to pay their\nrespects, and our old lady has asked that you should be sent over; so go\nback at once and change your clothes!\"\n\nWhen Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc heard what she said, he hastily picked up his books, and\nsaying good bye to Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, he came along with Hsi Jen, back into his\nroom, where we will leave him to effect the necessary change in his\ncostume. But during this while, Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc was, after having seen Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\nwalk away, and heard that all her cousins were likewise not in their\nrooms, wending her way back alone, in a dull and dejected mood, towards\nher apartment, when upon reaching the outside corner of the wall of the\nPear Fragrance court, she caught, issuing from inside the walls, the\nharmonious strains of the fife and the melodious modulations of voices\nsinging. Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc readily knew that it was the twelve singing-girls\nrehearsing a play; and though she did not give her mind to go and\nlisten, yet a couple of lines were of a sudden blown into her ears, and\nwith such clearness, that even one word did not escape. Their burden was\nthis:\n\n  These troth are beauteous purple and fine carmine flowers, which in\n      this way all round do bloom,\n  And all together lie ensconced along the broken well, and the\n      dilapidated wall!\n\nBut the moment Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc heard these lines, she was, in fact, so\nintensely affected and agitated that she at once halted and lending an\near listened attentively to what they went on to sing, which ran thus:\n\n  A glorious day this is, and pretty scene, but sad I feel at heart!\n  Contentment and pleasure are to be found in whose family courts?\n\nAfter overhearing these two lines, she unconsciously nodded her head,\nand sighed, and mused in her own mind. \"Really,\" she thought, \"there is\nfine diction even in plays! but unfortunately what men in this world\nsimply know is to see a play, and they don't seem to be able to enjoy\nthe beauties contained in them.\"\n\nAt the conclusion of this train of thought, she experienced again a\nsting of regret, (as she fancied) she should not have given way to such\nidle thoughts and missed attending to the ballads; but when she once\nmore came to listen, the song, by some coincidence, went on thus:\n\n  It's all because thy loveliness is like a flower and like the comely\n      spring,\n  That years roll swiftly by just like a running stream.\n\nWhen this couplet struck Tai-yu's ear, her heart felt suddenly a prey to\nexcitement and her soul to emotion; and upon further hearing the words:\n\n  Alone you sit in the secluded inner rooms to self-compassion giving\n      way.\n\n--and other such lines, she became still more as if inebriated, and like\nas if out of her head, and unable to stand on her feet, she speedily\nstooped her body, and, taking a seat on a block of stone, she minutely\npondered over the rich beauty of the eight characters:\n\n  It's all because thy loveliness is like a flower and like the comely\n      spring,\n  That years roll swiftly by just like a running stream.\n\nOf a sudden, she likewise bethought herself of the line:\n\n  Water flows away and flowers decay, for both no feelings have.\n\n--which she had read some days back in a poem of an ancient writer, and\nalso of the passage:\n\n  When on the running stream the flowers do fall, spring then is past\n      and gone;\n\n--and of:\n\n  Heaven (differs from) the human race,\n\n--which also appeared in that work; and besides these, the lines, which\nshe had a short while back read in the Hsi Hiang Chi:\n\n  The flowers, lo, fall, and on their course the waters red do flow!\n  Petty misfortunes of ten thousand kinds (my heart assail!)\n\nboth simultaneously flashed through her memory; and, collating them all\ntogether, she meditated on them minutely, until suddenly her heart was\nstricken with pain and her soul fleeted away, while from her eyes\ntrickled down drops of tears. But while nothing could dispel her present\nstate of mind, she unexpectedly realised that some one from behind gave\nher a tap; and, turning her head round to look, she found that it was a\nyoung girl; but who it was, the next chapter will make known.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\n  The drunken Chin Kang makes light of lucre and shows a preference for\n      generosity.\n  The foolish girl mislays her handkerchief and arouses mutual thoughts.\n\n\n\nBut to return to our narrative. Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc's sentimental reflections\nwere the while reeling and ravelling in an intricate maze, when\nunexpectedly some one from behind gave her a tap, saying: \"What are you\nup to all alone here?\" which took Lin Tai-yu so much by surprise that\nshe gave a start, and turning her head round to look and noticing that\nit was Hsiang Ling and no one else; \"You stupid girl!\" Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc\nreplied, \"you've given me such a fright! But where do you come from at\nthis time?\"\n\nHsiang Ling giggled and smirked. \"I've come,\" she added, \"in search of\nour young lady, but I can't find her anywhere. But your Tzu Chuan is\nalso looking after you; and she says that lady Secunda has sent a\npresent to you of some tea. But you had better go back home and sit\ndown.\"\n\nAs she spoke, she took Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc by the hand, and they came along back to\nthe Hsiao Hsiang Kuan; where lady Feng had indeed sent her two small\ncatties of a new season tea, of superior quality. But Lin Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc sat\ndown, in company with Hsiang Ling, and began to converse on the merits\nof this tapestry and the fineness of that embroidery; and after they had\nalso had a game at chess, and read a few sentences out of a book, Hsiang\nLing took her departure. But we need not speak of either of them, but\nreturn now to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. Having been found, and brought back home, by Hsi\nJen, he discovered Yuan Yang reclining on the bed, in the act of\nexamining Hsi Jen's needlework; but when she perceived Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc arrive,\nshe forthwith remarked: \"Where have you been? her venerable ladyship is\nwaiting for you to tell you to go over and pay your obeisance to our\nSenior master, and don't you still make haste to go and change your\nclothes and be off!\"\n\nHsi Jen at once walked into the room to fetch his clothes, and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\nsat on the edge of the bed, and pushed his shoes off with his toes; and,\nwhile waiting for his boots to put them on, he turned round and\nperceiving that Y\u00c3\u00bcan Yang, who was clad in a light red silk jacket and a\ngreen satin waistcoat, and girdled with a white crepe sash, had her face\nturned the other way, and her head lowered giving her attention to the\ncriticism of the needlework, while round her neck she wore a collar with\nembroidery, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc readily pressed his face against the nape of her\nneck, and as he sniffed the perfume about it, he did not stay his hand\nfrom stroking her neck, which in whiteness and smoothness was not below\nthat of Hsi Jen; and as he approached her, \"My dear girl,\" he said\nsmiling and with a drivelling face, \"do let me lick the cosmetic off\nyour mouth!\" clinging to her person, as he uttered these words, like\ntwisted sweetmeat.\n\n\"Hsi Jen!\" cried Y\u00c3\u00bcan Yang at once, \"come out and see! You've been with\nhim a whole lifetime, and don't you give him any advice; but let him\nstill behave in this fashion!\" Whereupon, Hsi Jen walked out, clasping\nthe clothes, and turning to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, she observed, \"I advise you in this\nway and it's no good, I advise you in that way and you don't mend; and\nwhat do you mean to do after all? But if you again behave like this, it\nwill then, in fact, be impossible for me to live any longer in this\nplace!\"\n\nAs she tendered these words of counsel, she urged him to put his clothes\non, and, after he had changed, he betook himself, along with Yuan Yang,\nto the front part of the mansion, and bade good-bye to dowager lady\nChia; after which he went outside, where the attendants and horses were\nall in readiness; but when he was about to mount his steed, he perceived\nChia Lien back from his visit and in the act of dismounting; and as the\ntwo of them stood face to face, and mutually exchanged some inquiries,\nthey saw some one come round from the side, and say: \"My respects to\nyou, uncle Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc!\"\n\nWhen Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc came to look at him, he noticed that this person had an\noblong face, that his body was tall and lanky, that his age was only\neighteen or nineteen, and that he possessed, in real truth, an air of\nrefinement and elegance; but though his features were, after all,\nexceedingly familiar, he could not recall to mind to what branch of the\nfamily he belonged, and what his name was.\n\n\"What are you staring vacantly for?\" Chia Lien inquired laughing.\n\n\"Don't you even recognise him? He's Y\u00c3\u00bcn Erh, the son of our fifth\nsister-in-law, who lives in the back court!\"\n\n\"Of course!\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc assented complacently. \"How is it that I had\nforgotten just now!\" And having gone on to ask how his mother was, and\nwhat work he had to do at present; \"I've come in search of uncle\nSecundus, to tell him something,\" Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn replied, as he pointed at\nChia Lien.\n\n\"You've really improved vastly from what you were before,\" added Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\nsmiling; \"you verily look just is if you were my son!\"\n\n\"How very barefaced!\" Chia Lien exclaimed as he burst out laughing;\n\"here's a person four or five years your senior to be made your son!\"\n\n\"How far are you in your teens this year?\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc inquired with a smile.\n\n\"Eighteen!\" Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn rejoined.\n\nThis Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn was, in real deed, sharp and quick-witted; and when he\nheard Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc remark that he looked like his son, he readily gave a\nsarcastic smile and observed, \"The proverb is true which says, 'the\ngrandfather is rocked in the cradle while the grandson leans on a\nstaff.' But though old enough in years, I'm nevertheless like a\nmountain, which, in spite of its height, cannot screen the sun from\nview. Besides, since my father's death, I've had no one to look after\nme, and were you, uncle Pao, not to disdain your doltish nephew, and to\nacknowledge me as your son, it would be your nephew's good fortune!\"\n\n\"Have you heard what he said?\" Chia Lien interposed cynically. \"But to\nacknowledge him as a son is no easy question to settle!\" and with these\nwords, he walked in; whereupon Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc smilingly said: \"To-morrow when\nyou have nothing to do, just come and look me up; but don't go and play\nany devilish pranks with them! I've just now no leisure, so come\nto-morrow, into the library, where I'll have a chat with you for a whole\nday, and take you into the garden for some fun!\"\n\nWith this remark still on his lips, he laid hold of the saddle and\nmounted his horse; and, followed by the whole bevy of pages, he crossed\nover to Chia She's on this side; where having discovered that Chia She\nhad nothing more the matter with him than a chill which he had suddenly\ncontracted, he commenced by delivering dowager lady Chia's message, and\nnext paid his own obeisance. Chia She, at first, stood up and made\nsuitable answer to her venerable ladyship's inquiries, and then calling\na servant, \"Take the gentleman,\" he said, \"into my lady's apartment to\nsit down.\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc withdrew out of the room, and came by the back to the upper\napartment; and as soon as madame Hsing caught sight of him, she, before\neverything else, rose to her feet and asked after old lady Chia's\nhealth; after which, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc made his own salutation, and madame Hsing\ndrew him on to the stove-couch, where she induced him to take a seat,\nand eventually inquired after the other inmates, and also gave orders to\nserve the tea. But scarcely had they had tea, before they perceived Chia\nTsung come in to pay his respects to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc.\n\n\"Where could one find such a living monkey as this!\" madame Hsing\nremarked; \"is that nurse of yours dead and gone that she doesn't even\nkeep you clean and tidy, and that she lets you go about with those\neyebrows of yours so black and that mouth so filthy! you scarcely look\nlike the child of a great family of scholars.\"\n\nWhile she spoke, she perceived both Chia Huan and Chia Lan, one of whom\nwas a young uncle and the other his nephew, also advance and present\ntheir compliments, and madame Hsing bade the two of them sit down on the\nchairs. But when Chia Huan noticed that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc sat on the same rug with\nmadame Hsing, and that her ladyship was further caressing and petting\nhim in every possible manner, he soon felt so very unhappy at heart,\nthat, after sitting for a short time, he forthwith made a sign to Chia\nLan that he would like to go; and as Chia Lan could not but humour him,\nthey both got up together to take their leave. But when Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc perceived\nthem rise, he too felt a wish to go back along with them, but madame\nHsing remarked smilingly, \"You had better sit a while as I've something\nmore to tell you,\" so that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had no alternative but to stay. \"When\nyou get back,\" madame Hsing added, addressing the other two, \"present,\neach one of you, my regards to your respective mothers. The young\nladies, your cousins, are all here making such a row that my head is\ndazed, so that I won't to-day keep you to have your repast here.\" To\nwhich Chia Huan and Chia Lan assented and quickly walked out.\n\n\"If it be really the case that all my cousins have come over,\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\nventured with a smirk, \"how is it that I don't see them?\"\n\n\"After sitting here for a while,\" madame Hsing explained, \"they all went\nat the back; but in what rooms they have gone, I don't know.\"\n\n\"My senior aunt, you said you had something to tell me, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc observed;\nwhat's it, I wonder?\"\n\n\"What can there possibly be to tell you?\" madame Hsing laughed; \"it was\nsimply to make you wait and have your repast with the young ladies and\nthen go; but there's also a fine plaything that I'll give you to take\nback to amuse yourself with.\"\n\nThese two, the aunt and her nephew, were going on with their colloquy\nwhen, much to their surprise, it was time for dinner and the young\nladies were all invited to come. The tables and chairs were put in their\nplaces, and the cups and plates were arranged in proper order; and,\nafter the mother, her daughter and the cousins had finished their meal,\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc bade good-bye to Chia She and returned home in company with all\nthe young ladies; and when they had said good-night to dowager lady\nChia, madame Wang and the others, they each went back into their rooms\nand retired to rest; where we shall leave them without any further\ncomment and speak of Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn's visit to the mansion. As soon as he saw\nChia Lien, he inquired what business it was that had turned up, and Chia\nLien consequently explained: \"The other day something did actually\npresent itself, but as it happened that your aunt had again and again\nentreated me, I gave it to Chia Ch'in; as she promised me that there\nwould be by and by in the garden several other spots where flowers and\ntrees would be planted; and that when this job did occur, she would, for\na certainty, give it to you and finish!\"\n\nChia Y\u00c3\u00bcn, upon hearing these words, suggested after a short pause; \"If\nthat be so, there's nothing for me to do than to wait; but, uncle, you\ntoo mustn't make any allusion beforehand in the presence of aunt to my\nhaving come to-day to make any inquiries; for there will really be ample\ntime to speak to her when the job turns up!\"\n\n\"Why should I allude to it?\" Chia Lien rejoined. \"Have I forsooth got\nall this leisure to talk of irrelevant matters! But to-morrow, besides,\nI've got to go as far as Hsing Yi for a turn, and it's absolutely\nnecessary that I should hurriedly come back the very same day; so off\nwith you now and go and wait; and the day after to-morrow, after the\nwatch has been set, come and ask for news; but mind at any earlier hour,\nI shan't have any leisure!\" With these words, he hastily went at the\nback to change his clothes. And from the time Chia Yun put his foot out\nof the door of the Jung Kuo mansion, he was, the whole way homeward,\nplunged in deep thought; but having bethought himself of some expedient,\nhe straightway wended his steps towards the house of his maternal uncle,\nPu Shih-jen. This Pu Shih-jen, it must be explained, kept, at the\npresent date, a shop for the sale of spices. He had just returned home\nfrom his shop, and as soon as he noticed Chia Yun, he inquired of him\nwhat business brought him there.\n\n\"There's something,\" Chia Yun replied, \"in which I would like to crave\nyour assistance, uncle; I'm in need of some baroos camphor and musk, so\nplease, uncle, give me on credit four ounces of each kind, and on the\nfestival of the eighth moon, I'll bring you the amount in full.\"\n\nPu Shih-jen gave a sardonic smile. \"Don't,\" he said, \"again allude to\nany such thing as selling on tick! Some time back a partner in our\nestablishment got several ounces of goods for his relatives on credit,\nand up to this date the bill hasn't as yet been settled; the result\nbeing that we've all had to make the amount good, so that we've entered\ninto an agreement that we should no more allow any one to obtain on tick\nanything on behalf of either relative or friend, and that whoever acted\ncontrary to this resolution should be, at once, fined twenty taels, with\nwhich to stand a treat. Besides, the stock of these articles is now\nshort, and were you also to come, with ready money to this our mean shop\nto buy any, we wouldn't even have as much to give you. The best way\ntherefore is for you to go elsewhere. This is one side of the question;\nfor on the other, you can't have anything above-board in view; and were\nyou to obtain what you want as a loan you would again go and play the\ngiddy dog! But you'll simply say that on every occasion your uncle sees\nyou, he avails himself of it to find fault with you, but a young fellow\nlike you doesn't know what's good and what is bad; and you should,\nbesides, make up your mind to earn a few cash, wherewith to clothe and\nfeed yourself, so that, when I see you, I too may rejoice!\"\n\n\"What you, uncle, say,\" Chia Yun rejoined smiling, \"is perfectly right;\nthe only thing is that at the time of my father's death, I was likewise\nso young in years that I couldn't understand anything; but later on, I\nheard my mother explain how that for everything, it was lucky that you,\nafter all, my uncles, went over to our house and devised the ways and\nmeans, and managed the funeral; and is it likely you, uncle, aren't\naware of these things? Besides, have I forsooth had a single acre of\nland or a couple of houses, the value of which I've run through as soon\nas it came into my hands? An ingenious wife cannot make boiled rice\nwithout raw rice; and what would you have me do? It's your good fortune\nhowever that you've got to deal with one such as I am, for had it been\nany one else barefaced and shameless, he would have come, twice every\nthree days, to worry you, uncle, by asking for two pints of rice and two\nof beans, and you then, uncle, would have had no help for it.\"\n\n\"My dear child,\" Pu Shih-jen exclaimed, \"had I anything that I could\ncall my own, your uncle as I am, wouldn't I feel bound to do something\nfor you? I've day after day mentioned to your aunt that the misfortune\nwas that you had no resources. But should you ever succeed in making up\nyour mind, you should go into that mighty household of yours, and when\nthe gentlemen aren't looking, forthwith pocket your pride and hobnob\nwith those managers, or possibly with the butlers, as you may, even\nthrough them, be able to get some charge or other! The other day, when I\nwas out of town, I came across that old Quartus of the third branch of\nthe family, astride of a tall donkey, at the head of four or five\ncarriages, in which were about forty to fifty bonzes and Taoist priests\non their way to the family fane, and that man can't lack brains, for\nsuch a charge to have fallen to his share!\"\n\nChia Y\u00c3\u00bcn, upon hearing these words, indulged in a long and revolting\nrigmarole, and then got up to take his leave.\n\n\"What are you in such a hurry for?\" Pu Shih-jen remarked. \"Have your\nmeal and then go!\"\n\nBut this remark was scarcely ended when they heard his wife say: \"Are\nyou again in the clouds? When I heard that there was no rice, I bought\nhalf a catty of dry rice paste, and brought it here for you to eat; and\ndo you pray now still put on the airs of a well-to-do, and keep your\nnephew to feel the pangs of hunger?\"\n\n\"Well, then, buy half a catty more, and add to what there is, that's\nall,\" Pu Shih-jen continued; whereupon her mother explained to her\ndaughter, Yin Chieh, \"Go over to Mrs. Wang's opposite, and ask her if\nshe has any cash, to lend us twenty or thirty of them; and to-morrow,\nwhen they're brought over, we'll repay her.\"\n\nBut while the husband and wife were carrying on this conversation, Chia\nY\u00c3\u00bcn had, at an early period, repeated several times: \"There's no need to\ngo to this trouble,\" and off he went, leaving no trace or shadow behind.\nBut without passing any further remarks on the husband and wife of the\nPu family, we will now confine ourselves to Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn. Having gone in\nhigh dudgeon out of the door of his uncle's house, he started straight\non his way back home; but while distressed in mind, and preoccupied with\nhis thoughts, he paced on with drooping head, he unexpectedly came into\ncollision with a drunken fellow, who gripped Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn, and began to\nabuse him, crying: \"Are your eyes gone blind, that you come bang against\nme?\"\n\nThe tone of voice, when it reached Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn ears, sounded like that of\nsome one with whom he was intimate; and, on careful scrutiny, he found,\nin fact, that it was his next-door neighbour, Ni Erh. This Ni Erh was a\ndissolute knave, whose only idea was to give out money at heavy rates of\ninterest and to have his meals in the gambling dens. His sole delight\nwas to drink and to fight.\n\nHe was, at this very moment, coming back home from the house of a\ncreditor, whom he had dunned, and was already far gone with drink, so\nthat when, at an unforeseen moment, Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn ran against him, he meant\nthere and then to start a scuffle with him.\n\n\"Old Erh!\" Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn shouted, \"stay your hand; it's I who have hustled\nagainst you.\"\n\nAs soon as Ni Erh heard the tone of his voice, he opened wide his\ndrunken eyes and gave him a look; and realising that it was Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn, he\nhastened to loosen his grasp and to remark with a smile, as he staggered\nabout, \"Is it you indeed, master Chia Secundus? where were you off to\nnow?\"\n\n\"I couldn't tell you!\" Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn rejoined; \"I've again brought\ndispleasure upon me, and all through no fault of mine.\"\n\n\"Never mind!\" urged Ni Erh, \"if you're in any trouble you just tell me,\nand I'll give vent to your spite for you; for in these three streets,\nand six lanes, no matter who may give offence to any neighbours of mine,\nof me, Ni Erh, the drunken Chin Kang, I'll wager that I compel that\nman's family to disperse, and his home to break up!\"\n\n\"Old Ni, don't lose your temper,\" Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn protested, \"but listen and\nlet me tell you what happened!\" After which, he went on to tell Ni Erh\nthe whole affair with Pu Shih-jen. As soon as Ni Erh heard him, he got\ninto a frightful rage; \"Were he not,\" he shouted, a \"relative of yours,\nmaster Secundus, I would readily give him a bit of my mind! Really\nresentment will stifle my breath! but never mind! you needn't however\ndistress yourself. I've got here a few taels ready at hand, which, if\nyou require, don't scruple to take; and from such good neighbours as you\nare, I won't ask any interest upon this money.\"\n\nWith this remark still on his lips, he produced from his pouch a bundle\nof silver.\n\n\"Ni Erh has, it is true, ever been a rogue,\" Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn reflected in his\nown mind, \"but as he is regulated in his dealings by a due regard to\npersons, he enjoys, to a great degree, the reputation of generosity; and\nwere I to-day not to accept this favour of his, he'll, I fear, be put to\nshame; and it won't contrariwise be nice on my part! and isn't it better\nthat I should make use of his money, and by and by I can repay him\ndouble, and things will be all right!\"\n\n\"Old Erh,\" he therefore observed aloud with a smile, \"you're really a\nfine fellow, and as you've shown me such eminent consideration, how can\nI presume not to accept your offer! On my return home, I'll write the\ncustomary I.O.U., and send it to you, and all will be in order.\"\n\nNi Erh gave a broad grin. \"It's only fifteen taels and three mace,\" he\nanswered, \"and if you insist upon writing an I.O.U., I won't then lend\nit to you!\"\n\nChia Y\u00c3\u00bcn at these words, took over the money, smiling the while. \"I'll\nreadily,\" he retorted, \"comply with your wishes and have done; for\nwhat's the use of exasperating you!\"\n\n\"Well then that will be all right!\" Ni Erh laughed; \"but the day is\ngetting dark; and I shan't ask you to have a cup of tea or stand you a\ndrink, for I've some small things more to settle. As for me, I'm going\nover there, but you, after all, should please wend your way homewards;\nand I shall also request you to take a message for me to my people. Tell\nthem to close the doors and turn in, as I'm not returning home; and that\nin the event of anything occurring, to bid our daughter come over\nto-morrow, as soon as it is daylight, to short-legged Wang's house, the\nhorse-dealer's, in search of me!\" And as he uttered this remark he\nwalked away, stumbling and hobbling along. But we will leave him without\nfurther notice and allude to Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn.\n\nHe had, at quite an unexpected juncture, met this piece of luck, so that\nhis heart was, of course, delighted to the utmost degree. \"This Ni Erh,\"\nhe mused, \"is really a good enough sort of fellow, but what I dread is\nthat he may have been open-handed in his fit of drunkenness, and that he\nmayn't, by and by, ask for his money to be paid twice over; and what\nwill I do then? Never mind,\" he suddenly went on to ponder, \"when that\njob has become an accomplished fact, I shall even have the means to pay\nhim back double the original amount.\"\n\nPrompted by this resolution, he came over to a money-shop, and when he\nhad the silver weighed, and no discrepancy was discovered in the weight,\nhe was still more elated at heart; and on his way back, he first and\nforemost delivered Ni Erh's message to his wife, and then returned to\nhis own home, where he found his mother seated all alone on a\nstove-couch spinning thread. As soon as she saw him enter, she inquired\nwhere he had been the whole day long, in reply to which Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn,\nfearing lest his parent should be angry, forthwith made no allusion to\nwhat transpired with Pu Shih-jen, but simply explained that he had been\nin the western mansion, waiting for his uncle Secundus, Lien. This over,\nhe asked his mother whether she had had her meal or not, and his parent\nsaid by way of reply: \"I've had it, but I've kept something for you in\nthere,\" and calling to the servant-maid, she bade her bring it round,\nand set it before him to eat. But as it was already dark, when the lamps\nhad to be lit, Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn, after partaking of his meal, got ready and\nturned in.\n\nNothing of any notice transpired the whole night; but the next day, as\nsoon it was dawn, he got up, washed his face, and came to the main\nstreet, outside the south gate, and purchasing some musk from a\nperfumery shop, he, with rapid stride, entered the Jung Kuo mansion; and\nhaving, as a result of his inquiries, found out that Chia Lien had gone\nout of doors, Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn readily betook himself to the back, in front of\nthe door of Chia Lien's court, where he saw several servant-lads, with\nimmense brooms in their hands, engaged in that place in sweeping the\ncourt. But as he suddenly caught sight of Chou Jui's wife appear outside\nthe door, and call out to the young boys; \"Don't sweep now, our lady is\ncoming out,\" Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn eagerly walked up to her and inquired, with a face\nbeaming with smiles: \"Where's aunt Secunda going to?\"\n\nTo this inquiry, Chou Jui's wife explained: \"Our old lady has sent for\nher, and I expect, it must be for her to cut some piece of cloth or\nother.\" But while she yet spoke, they perceived a whole bevy of people,\npressing round lady Feng, as she egressed from the apartment.\n\nChia Y\u00c3\u00bcn was perfectly aware that lady Feng took pleasure in flattery,\nand delighted in display, so that hastily dropping his arms, he with all\nreverence, thrust himself forward and paid his respects to her. But lady\nFeng did not even so much as turn to look at him with straight eyes; but\ncontinued, as hitherto, her way onwards, simply confining herself to\nascertaining whether his mother was all right, and adding: \"How is it\nthat she doesn't come to our house for a stroll?\"\n\n\"The thing is,\" Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn replied, \"that she's not well: she, however,\noften thinks fondly of you, aunt, and longs to see you; but as for\ncoming round, she's quite unable to do so.\"\n\n\"You have, indeed, the knack of telling lies!\" lady Feng laughed with\nirony; \"for hadn't I alluded to her, she would never have thought of\nme!\"\n\n\"Isn't your nephew afraid,\" Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn protested smilingly, \"of being\nblasted by lightning to have the audacity of telling lies in the\npresence of an elder! Even so late as yesterday evening, she alluded to\nyou, aunt! 'Though naturally,' she said, 'of a weak constitution, you\nhad, however, plenty to attend to! that it's thanks to your supremely\neminent energies, aunt, that you're, after all, able to manage\neverything in such a perfect manner; and that had you ever made the\nslightest slip, there would have long ago crept up, goodness knows, what\ntroubles!'\"\n\nAs soon as lady Feng heard these words, her whole face beamed with\nsmiles, and she unconsciously halted her steps, while she proceeded to\nask: \"How is it that, both your mother and yourself, tattle about me\nbehind my back, without rhyme or reason?\"\n\n\"There's a reason for it,\" Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn observed, \"which is simply this.\nI've an excellent friend with considerable money of his own at home, who\nrecently kept a perfumery shop; but as he obtained, by purchase, the\nrank of deputy sub-prefect, he was, the other day, selected for a post\nin Yunnan, in some prefecture or other unknown to me; whither he has\ngone together with his family. He even closed this shop of his, and\nforthwith collecting all his wares, he gave away, what he could give\naway, and what he had to sell at a discount, was sold at a loss; while\nsuch valuable articles, as these, were all presented to relatives or\nfriends; and that's why it is that I came in for some baroos camphor and\nmusk. But I at the time, deliberated with my mother that to sell them\nbelow their price would be a pity, and that if we wished to give them as\na present to any one, there was no one good enough to use such perfumes.\nBut remembering how you, aunt, had all along in years gone by, even to\nthis day, to spend large bundles of silver, in purchasing such articles,\nand how, not to speak of this year with an imperial consort in the\nPalace, what's even required for this dragon boat festival, will also\nnecessitate the addition of hundred times as much as the quantity of\nprevious years, I therefore present them to you, aunt, as a token of my\nesteem!\"\n\nWith these words still on his lips, he simultaneously produced an\nornamented box, which he handed over to her. And as lady Feng was, at\nthis time, making preparations for presents for the occasion of the\ndragon boat festival, for which perfumes were obligatory, she, with all\npromptitude, directed Feng Erh: \"Receive Mr. Y\u00c3\u00bcn's present and take it\nhome and hand it over to P'ing Erh. To one,\" she consequently added,\n\"who seems to me so full of discrimination, it isn't a wonder that your\nuncle is repeatedly alluding, and that he speaks highly of you; how that\nyou talk with all intelligence and that you have experience stored up in\nyour mind.\"\n\nChia Y\u00c3\u00bcn upon hearing this propitious language, hastily drew near one\nstep, and designedly asked: \"Does really uncle often refer to me?\"\n\nThe moment lady Feng caught this question, she was at once inclined to\ntell him all about the charge to be entrusted to him, but on second\nthought, she again felt apprehensive lest she should be looked lightly\nupon by him, by simply insinuating that she had promptly and needlessly\npromised him something to do, so soon as she got a little scented ware;\nand this consideration urged her to once more restrain her tongue, so\nthat she never made the slightest reference even to so much as one word\nabout his having been chosen to look after the works of planting the\nflowers and trees. And after confining herself to making the first few\nirrelevant remarks which came to her lips, she hastily betook herself\ninto dowager lady Chia's apartments.\n\nChia Y\u00c3\u00bcn himself did not feel as if he could very well advert to the\nsubject, with the result that he had no alternative but to retrace his\nsteps homewards. But as when he had seen Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc the previous day, he had\nasked him to go into the outer library and wait for him, he therefore\nfinished his meal and then once again entered the mansion and came over\ninto the I Hsia study, situated outside the ceremonial gate, over at old\nlady Chia's part of the compound, where he discovered the two lads Ming\nYen, whose name had been changed into Pei Ming, and Chu Yo playing at\nchess, and just arguing about the capture of a castle; and besides them,\nYin Ch'uan, Sao Hua, T'iao Y\u00c3\u00bcn, Pan Ho, these four or five of them, up\nto larks, stealing the young birds from the nests under the eaves of the\nhouse.\n\nAs soon as Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn entered the court, he stamped his foot and shouted,\n\"The monkeys are up to mischief! Here I am, I've come;\" and when the\ncompany of servant-boys perceived him, they one and all promptly\ndispersed; while Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn walked into the library, and seating himself\nat once in a chair, he inquired, \"Has your master Secundus, Mr. Pao,\ncome down?\"\n\n\"He hasn't been down here at all to-day,\" Pei Ming replied, \"but if you,\nMr. Secundus, have anything to tell him, I'll go and see what he's up to\nfor you.\"\n\nSaying this he there and then left the room; and Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn meanwhile gave\nhimself to the inspection of the pictures and nicknacks. But some\nconsiderable time elapsed, and yet he did not see him arrive; and\nnoticing besides that the other lads had all gone to romp, he was just\nplunged in a state of despondency, when he heard outside the door a\nvoice cry out, with winning tone, and tender accents: \"My elder\nbrother!\"\n\nChia Y\u00c3\u00bcn looked out, and saw that it was a servant-maid of fifteen or\nsixteen, who was indeed extremely winsome and spruce. As soon however as\nthe maid caught a glimpse of Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn, she speedily turned herself round\nand withdrew out of sight. But, as luck would have it, it happened that\nPei Ming was coming along, and seeing the servant-maid in front of the\ndoor, he observed: \"Welcome, welcome! I was quite at a loss how to get\nany news of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc.\" And as Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn discerned Pei Ming, he hastily too,\nran out in pursuit of him, and ascertained what was up; whereupon Pei\nMing returned for answer: \"I waited a whole day long, and not a single\nsoul came over; but this girl is attached to master Secundus' (Mr.\nPao's) rooms!\" and, \"My dear girl,\" he consequently went on to say, \"go\nin and take a message. Say that Mr. Secundus, who lives under the\nportico, has come!\"\n\nThe servant-maid, upon hearing these words, knew at once that he was a\nyoung gentleman belonging to the family in which she served, and she did\nnot skulk out of sight, as she had done in the first instance; but with\na gaze sufficient to kill, she fixed her two eyes upon Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn, when\nshe heard Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn interpose: \"What about over the portico and under the\nportico; you just tell him that Y\u00c3\u00bcn Erh is come, that's all.\"\n\nAfter a while this girl gave a sarcastic smile. \"My idea is,\" she\nventured, \"that you, master Secundus, should really, if it so please\nyou, go back, and come again to-morrow; and to-night, if I find time,\nI'll just put in a word with him!\"\n\n\"What's this that you're driving at?\" Pei Ming then shouted.\n\nAnd the maid rejoined: \"He's not even had a siesta to-day, so that he'll\nhave his dinner at an early hour, and won't come down again in the\nevening; and is it likely that you would have master Secundus wait here\nand suffer hunger? and isn't it better than he should return home? The\nright thing is that he should come to-morrow; for were even by and by\nsome one to turn up, who could take a message, that person would simply\nacquiesce with the lips, but would he be willing to deliver the message\nin for you?\"\n\nChia Y\u00c3\u00bcn, upon finding how concise and yet how well expressed this\ngirl's remarks had been, was bent upon inquiring what her name was; but\nas she was a maid employed in Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's apartments, he did not therefore\nfeel justified in asking the question, and he had no other course but to\nadd, \"What you say is quite right, I'll come to-morrow!\" and as he\nspoke, he there and then was making his way outside, when Pei Ming\nremarked: \"I'll go and pour a cup of tea; and master Secundus, have your\ntea and then go.\"\n\nChia Y\u00c3\u00bcn turned his head round, as he kept on his way, and said by way\nof rejoinder: \"I won't have any tea; for I've besides something more to\nattend to!\" and while with his lips he uttered these words, he, with his\neyes, stared at the servant-girl, who was still standing in there.\n\nChia Y\u00c3\u00bcn wended his steps straightway home; and the next day, he came to\nthe front entrance, where, by a strange coincidence, he met lady Feng on\nher way to the opposite side to pay her respects. She had just mounted\nher carriage, but perceiving Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn arrive, she eagerly bade a servant\nstop him, and, with the window between them, she smiled and observed:\n\"Y\u00c3\u00bcn Erh, you're indeed bold in playing your pranks with me! I thought\nit strange that you should give me presents; but the fact is you had a\nfavour to ask of me; and your uncle told me even yesterday that you had\nappealed to him!\"\n\nChia Y\u00c3\u00bcn smiled. \"Of my appeal to uncle, you needn't, aunt, make any\nmention; for I'm at this moment full of regret at having made it. Had I\nknown, at an early hour, that things would have come to this pass, I\nwould, from the very first, have made my request to you, aunt; and by\nthis time everything would have been settled long ago! But who would\nhave anticipated that uncle was, after all, a man of no worth!\"\n\n\"Strange enough,\" lady Feng remarked sneeringly, \"when you found that\nyou didn't succeed in that quarter, you came again yesterday in search\nof me!\"\n\n\"Aunt, you do my filial heart an injustice,\" Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn protested; \"I\nnever had such a thought; had I entertained any such idea, wouldn't I,\naunt, have made my appeal to you yesterday? But as you are now aware of\neverything, I'll really put uncle on one side, and prefer my request to\nyou; for circumstances compel me to entreat you, aunt, to be so good as\nto show me some little consideration!\"\n\nLady Feng laughed sardonically. \"You people will choose the long road to\nfollow and put me also in a dilemma! Had you told me just one word at an\nearly hour, what couldn't have been brought about? an affair of state\nindeed to be delayed up to this moment! In the garden, there are to be\nmore trees planted and flowers laid down, and I couldn't think of any\nperson that I could have recommended, and had you spoken before this,\nwouldn't the whole question have been settled soon enough?\"\n\n\"Well, in that case, aunt,\" ventured Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn with a smile, \"you had\nbetter depute me to-morrow, and have done!\"\n\n\"This job,\" continued lady Feng after a pause, \"is not, my impression\nis, very profitable; and if you were to wait till the first moon of next\nyear, when the fireworks, lanterns, and candles will have to be\npurveyed, I'll depute you as soon as those extensive commissions turn\nup.\"\n\n\"My dear aunt,\" pleaded Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn, \"first appoint me to this one, and if\nI do really manage this satisfactorily, you can then commission me with\nthat other!\"\n\n\"You know in truth how to draw a long thread,\" lady Feng observed\nlaughing. \"But hadn't it been that your uncle had spoken to me on your\naccount, I wouldn't have concerned myself about you. But as I shall\ncross over here soon after the repast, you had better come at eleven\na.m., and fetch the money, for you to enter into the garden the day\nafter to-morrow, and have the flowers planted!\"\n\nAs she said this, she gave orders to drive the \"scented\" carriage, and\nwent on her way by the quickest cut; while Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn, who was\nirrepressibly delighted, betook himself into the I Hsia study, and\ninquired after Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. But, who would have thought it, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc had, at an\nearly hour, gone to the mansion of the Prince of Pei Ching, so that Chia\nY\u00c3\u00bcn had to sit in a listless mood till noon; and when he found out that\nlady Feng had returned, he speedily wrote an acknowledgment and came to\nreceive the warrant. On his arrival outside the court, he commissioned a\nservant to announce him, and Ts'ai Ming thereupon walked out, and merely\nasking for the receipt, went in, and, after filling in the amount, the\nyear and moon, he handed it over to Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn together with the warrant.\nChia Y\u00c3\u00bcn received them from him, and as the entry consisted of two\nhundred taels, his heart was full of exultant joy; and turning round, he\nhurried to the treasury, where after he had taken over the amount in\nsilver, he returned home and laid the case before his mother, and\nneedless to say, that both the parent and her son were in high spirits.\nThe next day, at the fifth watch, Chia Yun first came in search of Ni\nErh, to whom he repaid the money, and then taking fifty taels along with\nhim, he sped outside the western gate to the house of Fang Ch'un, a\ngardener, to purchase trees, where we will leave him without saying\nanything more about him.\n\nWe will now resume our story with Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. The day on which he\nencountered Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn, he asked him to come in on the morrow and have a\nchat with him, but this invitation was practically the mere formal talk\nof a rich and well-to-do young man, and was not likely to be so much as\nborne in mind; and so it was that it readily slipped from his memory. On\nthe evening of the day, however, on which he returned home from the\nmansion of the Prince Pei Ching, he came, after paying his salutations\nto dowager lady Chia, madame Wang, and the other inmates, back into the\ngarden; but upon divesting himself of all his fineries, he was just\nabout to have his bath, when, as Hsi Jen had, at the invitation of Hs\u00c3\u00bceh\nPao-ch'ai, crossed over to tie a few knotted buttons, as Ch'in Wen and\nPi Hen had both gone to hurry the servants to bring the water, as T'an\nYun had likewise been taken home, on account of her mother's illness,\nand She Yueh, on the other hand, was at present ailing in her quarters,\nwhile the several waiting-maids, who were in there besides to attend to\nthe dirty work, and answer the calls, had, surmising that he would not\nrequisition their services, one and all gone out in search of their\nfriends and in quest of their companions, it occurred, contrary to their\ncalculations, that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc remained this whole length of time quite alone\nin his apartments; and as it so happened that Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc wanted tea to\ndrink, he had to call two or three times before he at last saw three old\nmatrons walk in. But at the sight of them, Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc hastily waved his hand\nand exclaimed: \"No matter, no matter; I don't want you,\" whereupon the\nmatrons had no help but to withdraw out of the rooms; and as Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\nperceived that there were no waiting-maids at hand, he had to come down\nand take a cup and go up to the teapot to pour the tea; when he heard\nsome one from behind him observe: \"Master Secundus, beware, you'll\nscorch your hand; wait until I come to pour it!\" And as she spoke, she\nwalked up to him, and took the cup from his grasp, to the intense\nsurprise, in fact, of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, who inquired: \"Where were you that you\nhave suddenly come to give me a start?\"\n\nThe waiting-maid smiled as she handed him the tea. \"I was in the back\ncourt,\" she replied, \"and just came in from the back door of the inner\nrooms; and is it likely that you didn't, sir, hear the sound of my\nfootsteps?\"\n\nPao-y\u00c3\u00bc drank his tea, and as he simultaneously passed the servant-girl\nunder a minute inspection, he found that though she wore several\narticles of clothing the worse for wear, she was, nevertheless, with\nthat head of beautiful hair, as black as the plumage of a raven, done up\nin curls, her face so oblong, her figure so slim and elegant, indeed,\nsupremely beautiful, sweet, and spruce, and Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc eagerly inquired:\n\"Are you also a girl attached to this room of mine?\"\n\n\"I am,\" rejoined that waiting-maid.\n\n\"But since you belong to this room, how is it I don't know you?\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc\nadded.\n\nWhen the maid heard these words, she forced a laugh. \"There are even\nmany,\" she explained, \"that are strangers to you; and is it only myself?\nI've never, before this, served tea, or handed water, or brought in\nanything; nor have I attended to a single duty in your presence, so how\ncould you know me?\"\n\n\"But why don't you attend to any of those duties that would bring you to\nmy notice?\" Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc questioned.\n\n\"I too,\" answered the maid, \"find it as difficult to answer such a\nquestion. There's however one thing that I must report to you, master\nSecundus. Yesterday, some Mr. Y\u00c3\u00bcn Erh or other came to see you; but as I\nthought you, sir, had no leisure, I speedily bade Pei Ming tell him to\ncome early to-day. But you unexpectedly went over again to the mansion\nof the Prince of Pei Ching.\"\n\nWhen she had spoken as far as this, she caught sight of Ch'iu Wen and Pi\nHen enter the court, giggling and laughing; the two of them carrying\nbetween them a bucket of water; and while raising their skirts with one\nhand, they hobbled along, as the water spurted and plashed. The\nwaiting-maid hastily come out to meet them so as to relieve them of\ntheir burden, but Ch'iu Wen and Pi Hen were in the act of standing face\nto face and finding fault with each other; one saying, \"You've wetted my\nclothes,\" the other adding, \"You've trod on my shoes,\" and upon, all of\na sudden, espying some one walk out to receive the water, and\ndiscovering, when they came to see, that it was actually no one else\nthan Hsiao Hung, they were at once both so taken aback that, putting\ndown the bucket, they hurried into the room; and when they looked about\nand saw that there was no other person inside besides Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc they were\nat once displeased. But as they were meanwhile compelled to get ready\nthe articles necessary for his bath, they waited until Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc was about\nto divest himself of his clothes, when the couple of them speedily\npulled the door to behind them, as they went out, and walked as far as\nthe room on the opposite side, in search of Hsiao Hung; of whom they\ninquired: \"What were you doing in his room a short while back?\"\n\n\"When was I ever in the room?\" Hsiao Hung replied; \"simply because I\nlost sight of my handkerchief, I went to the back to try and find it,\nwhen unexpectedly Mr. Secundus, who wanted tea, called for you sisters;\nand as there wasn't one even of you there, I walked in and poured a cup\nfor him, and just at that very moment you sisters came back.\"\n\n\"You barefaced, low-bred thing!\" cried Ch'iu Wen, turning towards her\nand spurting in her face. \"It was our bounden duty to tell you to go and\nhurry them for the water, but you simply maintained that you were busy\nand made us go instead, in order to afford you an opportunity of\nperforming these wily tricks! and isn't this raising yourself up li by\nli? But don't we forsooth, even so much as come up to you? and you just\ntake that looking-glass and see for yourself, whether you be fit to\nserve tea and to hand water or not?\"\n\n\"To-morrow,\" continued Pi Hea, \"I'll tell them that whenever there's\nanything to do connected with his wanting tea, or asking for water, or\nwith fetching things for him, not one of us should budge, and that\n_she_ alone should be allowed to go, and have done!\"\n\n\"If this be your suggestion,\" remarked Ch'iu Wen, \"wouldn't it be still\nbetter that we should all disperse, and let her reign supreme in this\nroom!\"\n\nBut while the two of them were up to this trouble, one saying one thing,\nand another, another, they caught sight of two old nurses walk in to\ndeliver a message from lady Feng; who explained: \"To-morrow, someone\nwill bring in gardeners to plant trees, and she bids you keep under more\nrigorous restraint, and not sun your clothes and petticoats anywhere and\neverywhere; nor air them about heedlessly; that the artificial hill\nwill, all along, be entirely shut in by screening curtains, and that you\nmustn't he running about at random.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" interposed Ch'iu Wen with alacrity, \"who it is that will\nbring the workmen to-morrow, and supervise the works?\"\n\n\"Some one or other called Mr. Y\u00c3\u00bcn, living at the back portico,\" the old\nwoman observed.\n\nBut Ch'iu Wen and Pi Hen were neither of them acquainted with him, and\nthey went on promiscuously asking further questions on his account, but\nHsiao Hung knew distinctly in her mind who it was, and was well aware\nthat it was the person whom she had seen, the previous day, in the outer\nlibrary.\n\nThe surname of this Hsiao Hung had, in fact, been originally Lin, while\nher infant name had been Hung Y\u00c3\u00bc; but as the word Y\u00c3\u00bc improperly\ncorresponded with the names of Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc and Tai-y\u00c3\u00bc, she was, in due\ncourse, simply called Hsiao Hung. She was indeed an hereditary servant\nof the mansion; and her father had latterly taken over the charge of all\nmatters connected with the farms and farmhouses in every locality. This\nHung-y\u00c3\u00bc came, at the age of sixteen, into the mansion, to enter into\nservice, and was attached to the Hung Yuan, where in point of fact she\nfound both a quiet and pleasant home; and when contrary to all\nexpectation, the young ladies as well as Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc, were subsequently\npermitted to move their quarters into the garden of Broad Vista, it so\nhappened that this place was, moreover, fixed upon by Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. This Hsiao\nHung was, it is true, a girl without any experience, but as she could,\nto a certain degree, boast of a pretty face, and as, in her own heart,\nshe recklessly fostered the idea of exalting herself to a higher\nstandard, she was ever ready to thrust herself in Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's way, with a\nview to showing herself off. But attached to Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc's personal service\nwere a lot of servants, all of whom were glib and specious, so that how\ncould she ever find an opportunity of thrusting herself forward? But\ncontrary to her anticipations, there turned up, eventually on this day,\nsome faint glimmer of hope, but as she again came in for a spell of\nspiteful abuse from Ch'iu Wen and her companion, her expectations were\nsoon considerably frustrated, and she was just plunged in a melancholy\nmood, when suddenly she heard the old nurse begin the conversation about\nChia Y\u00c3\u00bcn, which unconsciously so affected her heart that she hastily\nreturned, quite disconsolate, into her room, and lay herself down on her\nbed, giving herself quietly to reflection. But while she was racking and\ntorturing her brain and at a moment when she was at a loss what decision\nto grasp, her ear unexpectedly caught, emanating from outside the\nwindow, a faint voice say: \"Hsiao Hung, I've picked up your pocket\nhandkerchief in here!\" and as soon as Hsiao Hung heard these words, she\nwalked out with hurried step and found that it was no one else than Chia\nY\u00c3\u00bcn in person; and as Hsiao Hung unwillingly felt her powdered face\nsuffused with brushes: \"Where did you pick it up, Mr. Secundus?\" she\nasked.\n\n\"Come over,\" Chia Y\u00c3\u00bcn smiled, \"and I'll tell you!\" And as he uttered\nthese words, he came up and drew her to him; but Hsiao Hung twisted\nherself round and ran away; but was however tripped over by the step of\nthe door.\n\nNow, reader, do you want to know the sequel? If so the next chapter will\nexplain.\n\n\n\n\nEND OF BOOK I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  ERRATA [as noted in the original book].\n\n\n  Preface           rhythm not rhymes\n\n  Chap.

The original Chinese novel was\nwritten by Cao Xueqin. Another author later added half again as much. H.\nBencraft Joly translated only the work of the first author, essentially\ntwo-thirds of the whole; the work ends abruptly at the end of volume II\nas if he intended to go on, but the third volume was never published.\nThe work was not well proofread originally. There are other better and\nmore complete English translations, but this is the only one we could\nfind that is in the public domain in the USA.\n\nBoth lists of errata have been corrected in the text. The error noted\nin the original errata list as being on page 140 was actually on page\n145. There were far too many punctuation errata that were corrected,\nto list them all here.\n\nThere IS such a word as 'teapoy'; it is NOT 'teapot' and it means a\nthree-legged table. 'Dullness' was consistently spelled 'dulness' and is\nleft thus. 'Decrepit' was consistently spelled 'decrepid' and is left\nthus. 'Dote, dotes,' etc. was consistently spelled 'doat, doats,' etc.\nand is left thus. 'License' is spelled once thus and once 'licence.' The\nword 'speciality' appears only once, and that is the proper British\nspelling.\n\nWhenever a proper name normally contained an umlaut we attempted to\nsupply it in the instances where it was missing; this was most common\nwith the name Pao-y\u00c3\u00bc. There were also variations of use of apostrophes\nin proper names, and many were corrected. Neither of these is\nlisted in the errata above.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Hung Lou Meng, Book I, by Cao Xueqin\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HUNG LOU MENG, BOOK I ***\n\n***** This file should be named 9603-8.txt or 9603-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/9\/6\/0\/9603\/\n\nProduced by Juliet Sutherland and Project Gutenberg\nDistributed Proofreaders\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":298,"split":"train"}
