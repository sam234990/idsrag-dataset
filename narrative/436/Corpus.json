With the savings of a frugal life, and a loan, he has leased and stocked a sheep farm. He falls in love with a newcomer six years his junior, Bathsheba Everdene, a proud beauty who arrives to live with her aunt, Mrs. Hurst. Over time, Bathsheba and Gabriel grow to like each other well enough, and Bathsheba even saves his life once. However, when he makes her an unadorned offer of marriage, she refuses; she values her independence too much, and him too little. Feeling betrayed and embarrassed, Gabriel offers blunt protestations that only foster her haughtiness. After a few days, she moves to Weatherbury, a village some miles off.\nWhen next they meet, their circumstances have changed drastically. An inexperienced new sheepdog drives Gabriel's flock over a cliff, ruining him. After selling off everything of value, he manages to settle all his debts but emerges penniless. He seeks employment at a hiring fair in the town of Casterbridge. When he finds none, he heads to another such fair in Shottsford, a town about ten miles from Weatherbury. On the way, he happens upon a dangerous fire on a farm and leads the bystanders in putting it out. When the veiled owner comes to thank him, he asks if she needs a shepherd. She uncovers her face and reveals herself to be none other than Bathsheba. She has recently inherited her uncle's estate and is now wealthy. Though somewhat uncomfortable, she employs him.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Far from the Madding Crowd, by Thomas Hardy\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most\nother parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\nwhatsoever.

The series of novels I\nprojected being mainly of the kind called local, they seemed to\nrequire a territorial definition of some sort to lend unity to their\nscene.  Finding that the area of a single county did not afford a\ncanvas large enough for this purpose, and that there were objections\nto an invented name, I disinterred the old one.  The press and the\npublic were kind enough to welcome the fanciful plan, and willingly\njoined me in the anachronism of imagining a Wessex population living\nunder Queen Victoria;--a modern Wessex of railways, the penny post,\nmowing and reaping machines, union workhouses, lucifer matches,\nlabourers who could read and write, and National school children.\nBut I believe I am correct in stating that, until the existence of\nthis contemporaneous Wessex was announced in the present story, in\n1874, it had never been heard of, and that the expression, \"a Wessex\npeasant,\" or \"a Wessex custom,\" would theretofore have been taken to\nrefer to nothing later in date than the Norman Conquest.\n\nI did not anticipate that this application of the word to a modern\nuse would extend outside the chapters of my own chronicles.  But the\nname was soon taken up elsewhere as a local designation.  The first\nto do so was the now defunct _Examiner_, which, in the impression\nbearing date July 15, 1876, entitled one of its articles \"The Wessex\nLabourer,\" the article turning out to be no dissertation on farming\nduring the Heptarchy, but on the modern peasant of the south-west\ncounties, and his presentation in these stories.\n\nSince then the appellation which I had thought to reserve to the\nhorizons and landscapes of a merely realistic dream-country, has\nbecome more and more popular as a practical definition; and the\ndream-country has, by degrees, solidified into a utilitarian region\nwhich people can go to, take a house in, and write to the papers\nfrom.  But I ask all good and gentle readers to be so kind as to\nforget this, and to refuse steadfastly to believe that there are any\ninhabitants of a Victorian Wessex outside the pages of this and the\ncompanion volumes in which they were first discovered.\n\nMoreover, the village called Weatherbury, wherein the scenes of the\npresent story of the series are for the most part laid, would perhaps\nbe hardly discernible by the explorer, without help, in any existing\nplace nowadays; though at the time, comparatively recent, at which\nthe tale was written, a sufficient reality to meet the descriptions,\nboth of backgrounds and personages, might have been traced easily\nenough.  The church remains, by great good fortune, unrestored and\nintact, and a few of the old houses; but the ancient malt-house,\nwhich was formerly so characteristic of the parish, has been pulled\ndown these twenty years; also most of the thatched and dormered\ncottages that were once lifeholds.  The game of prisoner's base,\nwhich not so long ago seemed to enjoy a perennial vitality in front\nof the worn-out stocks, may, so far as I can say, be entirely unknown\nto the rising generation of schoolboys there.  The practice of\ndivination by Bible and key, the regarding of valentines as things of\nserious import, the shearing-supper, and the harvest-home, have, too,\nnearly disappeared in the wake of the old houses; and with them have\ngone, it is said, much of that love of fuddling to which the village\nat one time was notoriously prone.  The change at the root of this\nhas been the recent supplanting of the class of stationary cottagers,\nwho carried on the local traditions and humours, by a population\nof more or less migratory labourers, which has led to a break of\ncontinuity in local history, more fatal than any other thing to the\npreservation of legend, folk-lore, close inter-social relations, and\neccentric individualities.  For these the indispensable conditions\nof existence are attachment to the soil of one particular spot by\ngeneration after generation.\n\nT.H.\n\nFebruary 1895\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF FARMER OAK--AN INCIDENT\n\n\nWhen Farmer Oak smiled, the corners of his mouth spread till they\nwere within an unimportant distance of his ears, his eyes were\nreduced to chinks, and diverging wrinkles appeared round them,\nextending upon his countenance like the rays in a rudimentary sketch\nof the rising sun.\n\nHis Christian name was Gabriel, and on working days he was a young\nman of sound judgment, easy motions, proper dress, and general good\ncharacter.  On Sundays he was a man of misty views, rather given to\npostponing, and hampered by his best clothes and umbrella: upon the\nwhole, one who felt himself to occupy morally that vast middle space\nof Laodicean neutrality which lay between the Communion people of\nthe parish and the drunken section,--that is, he went to church, but\nyawned privately by the time the congregation reached the Nicene\ncreed, and thought of what there would be for dinner when he meant to\nbe listening to the sermon. Or, to state his character as it stood\nin the scale of public opinion, when his friends and critics were in\ntantrums, he was considered rather a bad man; when they were pleased,\nhe was rather a good man; when they were neither, he was a man whose\nmoral colour was a kind of pepper-and-salt mixture.\n\nSince he lived six times as many working-days as Sundays, Oak's\nappearance in his old clothes was most peculiarly his own--the mental\npicture formed by his neighbours in imagining him being always\ndressed in that way.  He wore a low-crowned felt hat, spread out at\nthe base by tight jamming upon the head for security in high winds,\nand a coat like Dr. Johnson's; his lower extremities being encased\nin ordinary leather leggings and boots emphatically large, affording\nto each foot a roomy apartment so constructed that any wearer might\nstand in a river all day long and know nothing of damp--their maker\nbeing a conscientious man who endeavoured to compensate for any\nweakness in his cut by unstinted dimension and solidity.\n\nMr. Oak carried about him, by way of watch, what may be called a\nsmall silver clock; in other words, it was a watch as to shape and\nintention, and a small clock as to size. This instrument being\nseveral years older than Oak's grandfather, had the peculiarity of\ngoing either too fast or not at all.  The smaller of its hands, too,\noccasionally slipped round on the pivot, and thus, though the minutes\nwere told with precision, nobody could be quite certain of the hour\nthey belonged to.  The stopping peculiarity of his watch Oak remedied\nby thumps and shakes, and he escaped any evil consequences from the\nother two defects by constant comparisons with and observations of\nthe sun and stars, and by pressing his face close to the glass of his\nneighbours' windows, till he could discern the hour marked by the\ngreen-faced timekeepers within.  It may be mentioned that Oak's fob\nbeing difficult of access, by reason of its somewhat high situation\nin the waistband of his trousers (which also lay at a remote height\nunder his waistcoat), the watch was as a necessity pulled out by\nthrowing the body to one side, compressing the mouth and face to a\nmere mass of ruddy flesh on account of the exertion required, and\ndrawing up the watch by its chain, like a bucket from a well.\n\nBut some thoughtful persons, who had seen him walking across one\nof his fields on a certain December morning--sunny and exceedingly\nmild--might have regarded Gabriel Oak in other aspects than these.\nIn his face one might notice that many of the hues and curves of\nyouth had tarried on to manhood: there even remained in his remoter\ncrannies some relics of the boy.  His height and breadth would\nhave been sufficient to make his presence imposing, had they been\nexhibited with due consideration.  But there is a way some men have,\nrural and urban alike, for which the mind is more responsible than\nflesh and sinew: it is a way of curtailing their dimensions by their\nmanner of showing them.  And from a quiet modesty that would have\nbecome a vestal, which seemed continually to impress upon him that he\nhad no great claim on the world's room, Oak walked unassumingly and\nwith a faintly perceptible bend, yet distinct from a bowing of the\nshoulders.  This may be said to be a defect in an individual if he\ndepends for his valuation more upon his appearance than upon his\ncapacity to wear well, which Oak did not.\n\nHe had just reached the time of life at which \"young\" is ceasing to\nbe the prefix of \"man\" in speaking of one.  He was at the brightest\nperiod of masculine growth, for his intellect and his emotions were\nclearly separated: he had passed the time during which the influence\nof youth indiscriminately mingles them in the character of impulse,\nand he had not yet arrived at the stage wherein they become united\nagain, in the character of prejudice, by the influence of a wife and\nfamily.  In short, he was twenty-eight, and a bachelor.\n\nThe field he was in this morning sloped to a ridge called Norcombe\nHill.  Through a spur of this hill ran the highway between Emminster\nand Chalk-Newton.  Casually glancing over the hedge, Oak saw coming\ndown the incline before him an ornamental spring waggon, painted\nyellow and gaily marked, drawn by two horses, a waggoner walking\nalongside bearing a whip perpendicularly.  The waggon was laden with\nhousehold goods and window plants, and on the apex of the whole sat\na woman, young and attractive.  Gabriel had not beheld the sight for\nmore than half a minute, when the vehicle was brought to a standstill\njust beneath his eyes.\n\n\"The tailboard of the waggon is gone, Miss,\" said the waggoner.\n\n\"Then I heard it fall,\" said the girl, in a soft, though not\nparticularly low voice.  \"I heard a noise I could not account for\nwhen we were coming up the hill.\"\n\n\"I'll run back.\"\n\n\"Do,\" she answered.\n\nThe sensible horses stood--perfectly still, and the waggoner's steps\nsank fainter and fainter in the distance.\n\nThe girl on the summit of the load sat motionless, surrounded by\ntables and chairs with their legs upwards, backed by an oak settle,\nand ornamented in front by pots of geraniums, myrtles, and cactuses,\ntogether with a caged canary--all probably from the windows of the\nhouse just vacated.  There was also a cat in a willow basket, from\nthe partly-opened lid of which she gazed with half-closed eyes, and\naffectionately surveyed the small birds around.\n\nThe handsome girl waited for some time idly in her place, and the\nonly sound heard in the stillness was the hopping of the canary up\nand down the perches of its prison.  Then she looked attentively\ndownwards.  It was not at the bird, nor at the cat; it was at an\noblong package tied in paper, and lying between them.  She turned her\nhead to learn if the waggoner were coming.  He was not yet in sight;\nand her eyes crept back to the package, her thoughts seeming to run\nupon what was inside it.  At length she drew the article into her\nlap, and untied the paper covering; a small swing looking-glass was\ndisclosed, in which she proceeded to survey herself attentively.  She\nparted her lips and smiled.\n\nIt was a fine morning, and the sun lighted up to a scarlet glow the\ncrimson jacket she wore, and painted a soft lustre upon her bright\nface and dark hair.  The myrtles, geraniums, and cactuses packed\naround her were fresh and green, and at such a leafless season they\ninvested the whole concern of horses, waggon, furniture, and girl\nwith a peculiar vernal charm.  What possessed her to indulge in\nsuch a performance in the sight of the sparrows, blackbirds, and\nunperceived farmer who were alone its spectators,--whether the smile\nbegan as a factitious one, to test her capacity in that art,--nobody\nknows; it ended certainly in a real smile.  She blushed at herself,\nand seeing her reflection blush, blushed the more.\n\nThe change from the customary spot and necessary occasion of such an\nact--from the dressing hour in a bedroom to a time of travelling out\nof doors--lent to the idle deed a novelty it did not intrinsically\npossess.  The picture was a delicate one.  Woman's prescriptive\ninfirmity had stalked into the sunlight, which had clothed it in the\nfreshness of an originality.  A cynical inference was irresistible by\nGabriel Oak as he regarded the scene, generous though he fain would\nhave been.  There was no necessity whatever for her looking in the\nglass.  She did not adjust her hat, or pat her hair, or press a\ndimple into shape, or do one thing to signify that any such intention\nhad been her motive in taking up the glass.  She simply observed\nherself as a fair product of Nature in the feminine kind, her\nthoughts seeming to glide into far-off though likely dramas in which\nmen would play a part--vistas of probable triumphs--the smiles being\nof a phase suggesting that hearts were imagined as lost and won.\nStill, this was but conjecture, and the whole series of actions was\nso idly put forth as to make it rash to assert that intention had any\npart in them at all.\n\nThe waggoner's steps were heard returning.  She put the glass in the\npaper, and the whole again into its place.\n\nWhen the waggon had passed on, Gabriel withdrew from his point of\nespial, and descending into the road, followed the vehicle to the\nturnpike-gate some way beyond the bottom of the hill, where the\nobject of his contemplation now halted for the payment of toll.\nAbout twenty steps still remained between him and the gate, when he\nheard a dispute.  It was a difference concerning twopence between the\npersons with the waggon and the man at the toll-bar.\n\n\"Mis'ess's niece is upon the top of the things, and she says that's\nenough that I've offered ye, you great miser, and she won't pay any\nmore.\"  These were the waggoner's words.\n\n\"Very well; then mis'ess's niece can't pass,\" said the turnpike-keeper,\nclosing the gate.\n\nOak looked from one to the other of the disputants, and fell into\na reverie.  There was something in the tone of twopence remarkably\ninsignificant.  Threepence had a definite value as money--it was an\nappreciable infringement on a day's wages, and, as such, a higgling\nmatter; but twopence--\"Here,\" he said, stepping forward and handing\ntwopence to the gatekeeper; \"let the young woman pass.\"  He looked up\nat her then; she heard his words, and looked down.\n\nGabriel's features adhered throughout their form so exactly to the\nmiddle line between the beauty of St. John and the ugliness of Judas\nIscariot, as represented in a window of the church he attended, that\nnot a single lineament could be selected and called worthy either of\ndistinction or notoriety.  The red-jacketed and dark-haired maiden\nseemed to think so too, for she carelessly glanced over him, and told\nher man to drive on.  She might have looked her thanks to Gabriel on\na minute scale, but she did not speak them; more probably she felt\nnone, for in gaining her a passage he had lost her her point, and we\nknow how women take a favour of that kind.\n\nThe gatekeeper surveyed the retreating vehicle.  \"That's a\nhandsome maid,\" he said to Oak.\n\n\"But she has her faults,\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"True, farmer.\"\n\n\"And the greatest of them is--well, what it is always.\"\n\n\"Beating people down? ay, 'tis so.\"\n\n\"O no.\"\n\n\"What, then?\"\n\nGabriel, perhaps a little piqued by the comely traveller's\nindifference, glanced back to where he had witnessed her performance\nover the hedge, and said, \"Vanity.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nNIGHT--THE FLOCK--AN INTERIOR--ANOTHER INTERIOR\n\n\nIt was nearly midnight on the eve of St. Thomas's, the shortest day\nin the year.  A desolating wind wandered from the north over the hill\nwhereon Oak had watched the yellow waggon and its occupant in the\nsunshine of a few days earlier.\n\nNorcombe Hill--not far from lonely Toller-Down--was one of the spots\nwhich suggest to a passer-by that he is in the presence of a shape\napproaching the indestructible as nearly as any to be found on\nearth.  It was a featureless convexity of chalk and soil--an ordinary\nspecimen of those smoothly-outlined protuberances of the globe which\nmay remain undisturbed on some great day of confusion, when far\ngrander heights and dizzy granite precipices topple down.\n\nThe hill was covered on its northern side by an ancient and decaying\nplantation of beeches, whose upper verge formed a line over the\ncrest, fringing its arched curve against the sky, like a mane.\nTo-night these trees sheltered the southern slope from the keenest\nblasts, which smote the wood and floundered through it with a sound\nas of grumbling, or gushed over its crowning boughs in a weakened\nmoan.  The dry leaves in the ditch simmered and boiled in the same\nbreezes, a tongue of air occasionally ferreting out a few, and\nsending them spinning across the grass.  A group or two of the latest\nin date amongst the dead multitude had remained till this very\nmid-winter time on the twigs which bore them and in falling rattled\nagainst the trunks with smart taps.\n\nBetween this half-wooded half-naked hill, and the vague still horizon\nthat its summit indistinctly commanded, was a mysterious sheet of\nfathomless shade--the sounds from which suggested that what it\nconcealed bore some reduced resemblance to features here.  The thin\ngrasses, more or less coating the hill, were touched by the wind in\nbreezes of differing powers, and almost of differing natures--one\nrubbing the blades heavily, another raking them piercingly, another\nbrushing them like a soft broom.  The instinctive act of humankind\nwas to stand and listen, and learn how the trees on the right and the\ntrees on the left wailed or chaunted to each other in the regular\nantiphonies of a cathedral choir; how hedges and other shapes to\nleeward then caught the note, lowering it to the tenderest sob; and\nhow the hurrying gust then plunged into the south, to be heard no\nmore.\n\nThe sky was clear--remarkably clear--and the twinkling of all the\nstars seemed to be but throbs of one body, timed by a common pulse.\nThe North Star was directly in the wind's eye, and since evening the\nBear had swung round it outwardly to the east, till he was now at\na right angle with the meridian.  A difference of colour in the\nstars--oftener read of than seen in England--was really perceptible\nhere.  The sovereign brilliancy of Sirius pierced the eye with a\nsteely glitter, the star called Capella was yellow, Aldebaran and\nBetelgueux shone with a fiery red.\n\nTo persons standing alone on a hill during a clear midnight such as\nthis, the roll of the world eastward is almost a palpable movement.\nThe sensation may be caused by the panoramic glide of the stars past\nearthly objects, which is perceptible in a few minutes of stillness,\nor by the better outlook upon space that a hill affords, or by the\nwind, or by the solitude; but whatever be its origin, the impression\nof riding along is vivid and abiding.  The poetry of motion is a\nphrase much in use, and to enjoy the epic form of that gratification\nit is necessary to stand on a hill at a small hour of the night,\nand, having first expanded with a sense of difference from the mass\nof civilised mankind, who are dreamwrapt and disregardful of all\nsuch proceedings at this time, long and quietly watch your stately\nprogress through the stars.  After such a nocturnal reconnoitre it is\nhard to get back to earth, and to believe that the consciousness of\nsuch majestic speeding is derived from a tiny human frame.\n\nSuddenly an unexpected series of sounds began to be heard in this\nplace up against the sky.  They had a clearness which was to be found\nnowhere in the wind, and a sequence which was to be found nowhere in\nnature.  They were the notes of Farmer Oak's flute.\n\nThe tune was not floating unhindered into the open air: it seemed\nmuffled in some way, and was altogether too curtailed in power to\nspread high or wide.  It came from the direction of a small dark\nobject under the plantation hedge--a shepherd's hut--now presenting\nan outline to which an uninitiated person might have been puzzled\nto attach either meaning or use.\n\nThe image as a whole was that of a small Noah's Ark on a small\nArarat, allowing the traditionary outlines and general form of\nthe Ark which are followed by toy-makers--and by these means are\nestablished in men's imaginations among their firmest, because\nearliest impressions--to pass as an approximate pattern.  The hut\nstood on little wheels, which raised its floor about a foot from the\nground.  Such shepherds' huts are dragged into the fields when the\nlambing season comes on, to shelter the shepherd in his enforced\nnightly attendance.\n\nIt was only latterly that people had begun to call Gabriel \"Farmer\"\nOak.  During the twelvemonth preceding this time he had been enabled\nby sustained efforts of industry and chronic good spirits to lease\nthe small sheep-farm of which Norcombe Hill was a portion, and stock\nit with two hundred sheep.  Previously he had been a bailiff for a\nshort time, and earlier still a shepherd only, having from his\nchildhood assisted his father in tending the flocks of large\nproprietors, till old Gabriel sank to rest.\n\nThis venture, unaided and alone, into the paths of farming as master\nand not as man, with an advance of sheep not yet paid for, was a\ncritical juncture with Gabriel Oak, and he recognised his position\nclearly.  The first movement in his new progress was the lambing of\nhis ewes, and sheep having been his speciality from his youth, he\nwisely refrained from deputing the task of tending them at this\nseason to a hireling or a novice.\n\nThe wind continued to beat about the corners of the hut, but the\nflute-playing ceased.  A rectangular space of light appeared in the\nside of the hut, and in the opening the outline of Farmer Oak's\nfigure.  He carried a lantern in his hand, and closing the door\nbehind him, came forward and busied himself about this nook of the\nfield for nearly twenty minutes, the lantern light appearing and\ndisappearing here and there, and brightening him or darkening him\nas he stood before or behind it.\n\nOak's motions, though they had a quiet-energy, were slow, and their\ndeliberateness accorded well with his occupation.  Fitness being the\nbasis of beauty, nobody could have denied that his steady swings and\nturns in and about the flock had elements of grace.  Yet, although if\noccasion demanded he could do or think a thing with as mercurial a\ndash as can the men of towns who are more to the manner born, his\nspecial power, morally, physically, and mentally, was static, owing\nlittle or nothing to momentum as a rule.\n\nA close examination of the ground hereabout, even by the wan\nstarlight only, revealed how a portion of what would have been\ncasually called a wild slope had been appropriated by Farmer Oak for\nhis great purpose this winter.  Detached hurdles thatched with straw\nwere stuck into the ground at various scattered points, amid and\nunder which the whitish forms of his meek ewes moved and rustled.\nThe ring of the sheep-bell, which had been silent during his absence,\nrecommenced, in tones that had more mellowness than clearness, owing\nto an increasing growth of surrounding wool.  This continued till Oak\nwithdrew again from the flock.  He returned to the hut, bringing in\nhis arms a new-born lamb, consisting of four legs large enough for\na full-grown sheep, united by a seemingly inconsiderable membrane\nabout half the substance of the legs collectively, which constituted\nthe animal's entire body just at present.\n\nThe little speck of life he placed on a wisp of hay before the small\nstove, where a can of milk was simmering.  Oak extinguished the\nlantern by blowing into it and then pinching the snuff, the cot being\nlighted by a candle suspended by a twisted wire.  A rather hard\ncouch, formed of a few corn sacks thrown carelessly down, covered\nhalf the floor of this little habitation, and here the young man\nstretched himself along, loosened his woollen cravat, and closed his\neyes.  In about the time a person unaccustomed to bodily labour would\nhave decided upon which side to lie, Farmer Oak was asleep.\n\nThe inside of the hut, as it now presented itself, was cosy and\nalluring, and the scarlet handful of fire in addition to the candle,\nreflecting its own genial colour upon whatever it could reach, flung\nassociations of enjoyment even over utensils and tools.  In the\ncorner stood the sheep-crook, and along a shelf at one side were\nranged bottles and canisters of the simple preparations pertaining to\novine surgery and physic; spirits of wine, turpentine, tar, magnesia,\nginger, and castor-oil being the chief.  On a triangular shelf across\nthe corner stood bread, bacon, cheese, and a cup for ale or cider,\nwhich was supplied from a flagon beneath.  Beside the provisions lay\nthe flute, whose notes had lately been called forth by the lonely\nwatcher to beguile a tedious hour.  The house was ventilated by two\nround holes, like the lights of a ship's cabin, with wood slides.\n\nThe lamb, revived by the warmth began to bleat, and the sound entered\nGabriel's ears and brain with an instant meaning, as expected\nsounds will.  Passing from the profoundest sleep to the most alert\nwakefulness with the same ease that had accompanied the reverse\noperation, he looked at his watch, found that the hour-hand had\nshifted again, put on his hat, took the lamb in his arms, and carried\nit into the darkness.  After placing the little creature with its\nmother, he stood and carefully examined the sky, to ascertain the\ntime of night from the altitudes of the stars.\n\nThe Dog-star and Aldebaran, pointing to the restless Pleiades, were\nhalf-way up the Southern sky, and between them hung Orion, which\ngorgeous constellation never burnt more vividly than now, as it\nsoared forth above the rim of the landscape.  Castor and Pollux with\ntheir quiet shine were almost on the meridian: the barren and gloomy\nSquare of Pegasus was creeping round to the north-west; far away\nthrough the plantation Vega sparkled like a lamp suspended amid the\nleafless trees, and Cassiopeia's chair stood daintily poised on the\nuppermost boughs.\n\n\"One o'clock,\" said Gabriel.\n\nBeing a man not without a frequent consciousness that there was some\ncharm in this life he led, he stood still after looking at the sky\nas a useful instrument, and regarded it in an appreciative spirit,\nas a work of art superlatively beautiful.  For a moment he seemed\nimpressed with the speaking loneliness of the scene, or rather with\nthe complete abstraction from all its compass of the sights and\nsounds of man.  Human shapes, interferences, troubles, and joys\nwere all as if they were not, and there seemed to be on the shaded\nhemisphere of the globe no sentient being save himself; he could\nfancy them all gone round to the sunny side.\n\nOccupied thus, with eyes stretched afar, Oak gradually perceived\nthat what he had previously taken to be a star low down behind the\noutskirts of the plantation was in reality no such thing.  It was an\nartificial light, almost close at hand.\n\nTo find themselves utterly alone at night where company is desirable\nand expected makes some people fearful; but a case more trying by\nfar to the nerves is to discover some mysterious companionship when\nintuition, sensation, memory, analogy, testimony, probability,\ninduction--every kind of evidence in the logician's list--have united\nto persuade consciousness that it is quite in isolation.\n\nFarmer Oak went towards the plantation and pushed through its lower\nboughs to the windy side.  A dim mass under the slope reminded him\nthat a shed occupied a place here, the site being a cutting into the\nslope of the hill, so that at its back part the roof was almost level\nwith the ground.  In front it was formed of board nailed to posts and\ncovered with tar as a preservative.  Through crevices in the roof and\nside spread streaks and dots of light, a combination of which made\nthe radiance that had attracted him.  Oak stepped up behind, where,\nleaning down upon the roof and putting his eye close to a hole, he\ncould see into the interior clearly.\n\nThe place contained two women and two cows.  By the side of the\nlatter a steaming bran-mash stood in a bucket.  One of the women was\npast middle age.  Her companion was apparently young and graceful;\nhe could form no decided opinion upon her looks, her position being\nalmost beneath his eye, so that he saw her in a bird's-eye view, as\nMilton's Satan first saw Paradise.  She wore no bonnet or hat, but\nhad enveloped herself in a large cloak, which was carelessly flung\nover her head as a covering.\n\n\"There, now we'll go home,\" said the elder of the two, resting her\nknuckles upon her hips, and looking at their goings-on as a whole.\n\"I do hope Daisy will fetch round again now.  I have never been more\nfrightened in my life, but I don't mind breaking my rest if she\nrecovers.\"\n\nThe young woman, whose eyelids were apparently inclined to fall\ntogether on the smallest provocation of silence, yawned without\nparting her lips to any inconvenient extent, whereupon Gabriel caught\nthe infection and slightly yawned in sympathy.\n\n\"I wish we were rich enough to pay a man to do these things,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"As we are not, we must do them ourselves,\" said the other; \"for you\nmust help me if you stay.\"\n\n\"Well, my hat is gone, however,\" continued the younger. \"It went over\nthe hedge, I think.  The idea of such a slight wind catching it.\"\n\nThe cow standing erect was of the Devon breed, and was encased in a\ntight warm hide of rich Indian red, as absolutely uniform from eyes\nto tail as if the animal had been dipped in a dye of that colour, her\nlong back being mathematically level.  The other was spotted, grey\nand white.  Beside her Oak now noticed a little calf about a day old,\nlooking idiotically at the two women, which showed that it had not\nlong been accustomed to the phenomenon of eyesight, and often turning\nto the lantern, which it apparently mistook for the moon, inherited\ninstinct having as yet had little time for correction by experience.\nBetween the sheep and the cows Lucina had been busy on Norcombe Hill\nlately.\n\n\"I think we had better send for some oatmeal,\" said the elder woman;\n\"there's no more bran.\"\n\n\"Yes, aunt; and I'll ride over for it as soon as it is light.\"\n\n\"But there's no side-saddle.\"\n\n\"I can ride on the other: trust me.\"\n\nOak, upon hearing these remarks, became more curious to observe her\nfeatures, but this prospect being denied him by the hooding effect of\nthe cloak, and by his aerial position, he felt himself drawing upon\nhis fancy for their details.  In making even horizontal and clear\ninspections we colour and mould according to the wants within us\nwhatever our eyes bring in.  Had Gabriel been able from the first to\nget a distinct view of her countenance, his estimate of it as very\nhandsome or slightly so would have been as his soul required a\ndivinity at the moment or was ready supplied with one.  Having for\nsome time known the want of a satisfactory form to fill an increasing\nvoid within him, his position moreover affording the widest scope for\nhis fancy, he painted her a beauty.\n\nBy one of those whimsical coincidences in which Nature, like a busy\nmother, seems to spare a moment from her unremitting labours to turn\nand make her children smile, the girl now dropped the cloak, and\nforth tumbled ropes of black hair over a red jacket.  Oak knew\nher instantly as the heroine of the yellow waggon, myrtles, and\nlooking-glass: prosily, as the woman who owed him twopence.\n\nThey placed the calf beside its mother again, took up the lantern,\nand went out, the light sinking down the hill till it was no more\nthan a nebula.  Gabriel Oak returned to his flock.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nA GIRL ON HORSEBACK--CONVERSATION\n\n\nThe sluggish day began to break.  Even its position terrestrially is\none of the elements of a new interest, and for no particular reason\nsave that the incident of the night had occurred there Oak went again\ninto the plantation.  Lingering and musing here, he heard the steps of\na horse at the foot of the hill, and soon there appeared in view an\nauburn pony with a girl on its back, ascending by the path leading\npast the cattle-shed.  She was the young woman of the night before.\nGabriel instantly thought of the hat she had mentioned as having\nlost in the wind; possibly she had come to look for it.  He hastily\nscanned the ditch and after walking about ten yards along it found\nthe hat among the leaves.  Gabriel took it in his hand and returned\nto his hut.  Here he ensconced himself, and peeped through the\nloophole in the direction of the rider's approach.\n\nShe came up and looked around--then on the other side of the hedge.\nGabriel was about to advance and restore the missing article when\nan unexpected performance induced him to suspend the action for\nthe present.  The path, after passing the cowshed, bisected the\nplantation.  It was not a bridle-path--merely a pedestrian's track,\nand the boughs spread horizontally at a height not greater than seven\nfeet above the ground, which made it impossible to ride erect beneath\nthem.  The girl, who wore no riding-habit, looked around for a\nmoment, as if to assure herself that all humanity was out of view,\nthen dexterously dropped backwards flat upon the pony's back, her\nhead over its tail, her feet against its shoulders, and her eyes to\nthe sky.  The rapidity of her glide into this position was that of\na kingfisher--its noiselessness that of a hawk.  Gabriel's eyes had\nscarcely been able to follow her.  The tall lank pony seemed used to\nsuch doings, and ambled along unconcerned.  Thus she passed under the\nlevel boughs.\n\nThe performer seemed quite at home anywhere between a horse's head\nand its tail, and the necessity for this abnormal attitude having\nceased with the passage of the plantation, she began to adopt\nanother, even more obviously convenient than the first.  She had\nno side-saddle, and it was very apparent that a firm seat upon the\nsmooth leather beneath her was unattainable sideways.  Springing to\nher accustomed perpendicular like a bowed sapling, and satisfying\nherself that nobody was in sight, she seated herself in the manner\ndemanded by the saddle, though hardly expected of the woman, and\ntrotted off in the direction of Tewnell Mill.\n\nOak was amused, perhaps a little astonished, and hanging up the hat\nin his hut, went again among his ewes.  An hour passed, the girl\nreturned, properly seated now, with a bag of bran in front of\nher.  On nearing the cattle-shed she was met by a boy bringing a\nmilking-pail, who held the reins of the pony whilst she slid off.\nThe boy led away the horse, leaving the pail with the young woman.\n\nSoon soft spirts alternating with loud spirts came in regular\nsuccession from within the shed, the obvious sounds of a person\nmilking a cow.  Gabriel took the lost hat in his hand, and waited\nbeside the path she would follow in leaving the hill.\n\nShe came, the pail in one hand, hanging against her knee. The left\narm was extended as a balance, enough of it being shown bare to make\nOak wish that the event had happened in the summer, when the whole\nwould have been revealed.  There was a bright air and manner about\nher now, by which she seemed to imply that the desirability of her\nexistence could not be questioned; and this rather saucy assumption\nfailed in being offensive because a beholder felt it to be, upon the\nwhole, true.  Like exceptional emphasis in the tone of a genius,\nthat which would have made mediocrity ridiculous was an addition to\nrecognised power.  It was with some surprise that she saw Gabriel's\nface rising like the moon behind the hedge.\n\nThe adjustment of the farmer's hazy conceptions of her charms to the\nportrait of herself she now presented him with was less a diminution\nthan a difference.  The starting-point selected by the judgment was\nher height. She seemed tall, but the pail was a small one, and the\nhedge diminutive; hence, making allowance for error by comparison\nwith these, she could have been not above the height to be chosen by\nwomen as best.  All features of consequence were severe and regular.\nIt may have been observed by persons who go about the shires with\neyes for beauty, that in Englishwoman a classically-formed face is\nseldom found to be united with a figure of the same pattern, the\nhighly-finished features being generally too large for the remainder\nof the frame; that a graceful and proportionate figure of eight heads\nusually goes off into random facial curves.  Without throwing a\nNymphean tissue over a milkmaid, let it be said that here criticism\nchecked itself as out of place, and looked at her proportions with a\nlong consciousness of pleasure.  From the contours of her figure in\nits upper part, she must have had a beautiful neck and shoulders; but\nsince her infancy nobody had ever seen them.  Had she been put into\na low dress she would have run and thrust her head into a bush.  Yet\nshe was not a shy girl by any means; it was merely her instinct to\ndraw the line dividing the seen from the unseen higher than they do\nit in towns.\n\nThat the girl's thoughts hovered about her face and form as soon as\nshe caught Oak's eyes conning the same page was natural, and almost\ncertain.  The self-consciousness shown would have been vanity if\na little more pronounced, dignity if a little less.  Rays of male\nvision seem to have a tickling effect upon virgin faces in rural\ndistricts; she brushed hers with her hand, as if Gabriel had been\nirritating its pink surface by actual touch, and the free air of her\nprevious movements was reduced at the same time to a chastened phase\nof itself.  Yet it was the man who blushed, the maid not at all.\n\n\"I found a hat,\" said Oak.\n\n\"It is mine,\" said she, and, from a sense of proportion, kept down to\na small smile an inclination to laugh distinctly: \"it flew away last\nnight.\"\n\n\"One o'clock this morning?\"\n\n\"Well--it was.\"  She was surprised.  \"How did you know?\" she said.\n\n\"I was here.\"\n\n\"You are Farmer Oak, are you not?\"\n\n\"That or thereabouts.  I'm lately come to this place.\"\n\n\"A large farm?\" she inquired, casting her eyes round, and swinging\nback her hair, which was black in the shaded hollows of its mass; but\nit being now an hour past sunrise the rays touched its prominent\ncurves with a colour of their own.\n\n\"No; not large.  About a hundred.\"  (In speaking of farms the word\n\"acres\" is omitted by the natives, by analogy to such old expressions\nas \"a stag of ten.\")\n\n\"I wanted my hat this morning,\" she went on.  \"I had to ride to\nTewnell Mill.\"\n\n\"Yes you had.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"I saw you.\"\n\n\"Where?\" she inquired, a misgiving bringing every muscle of her\nlineaments and frame to a standstill.\n\n\"Here--going through the plantation, and all down the hill,\" said\nFarmer Oak, with an aspect excessively knowing with regard to some\nmatter in his mind, as he gazed at a remote point in the direction\nnamed, and then turned back to meet his colloquist's eyes.\n\nA perception caused him to withdraw his own eyes from hers as\nsuddenly as if he had been caught in a theft.  Recollection of the\nstrange antics she had indulged in when passing through the trees was\nsucceeded in the girl by a nettled palpitation, and that by a hot\nface.  It was a time to see a woman redden who was not given to\nreddening as a rule; not a point in the milkmaid but was of the\ndeepest rose-colour.  From the Maiden's Blush, through all varieties\nof the Provence down to the Crimson Tuscany, the countenance of Oak's\nacquaintance quickly graduated; whereupon he, in considerateness,\nturned away his head.\n\nThe sympathetic man still looked the other way, and wondered when she\nwould recover coolness sufficient to justify him in facing her again.\nHe heard what seemed to be the flitting of a dead leaf upon the\nbreeze, and looked.  She had gone away.\n\nWith an air between that of Tragedy and Comedy Gabriel returned to\nhis work.\n\nFive mornings and evenings passed.  The young woman came regularly to\nmilk the healthy cow or to attend to the sick one, but never allowed\nher vision to stray in the direction of Oak's person.  His want of\ntact had deeply offended her--not by seeing what he could not help,\nbut by letting her know that he had seen it.  For, as without law\nthere is no sin, without eyes there is no indecorum; and she appeared\nto feel that Gabriel's espial had made her an indecorous woman\nwithout her own connivance.  It was food for great regret with him;\nit was also a _contretemps_ which touched into life a latent heat he\nhad experienced in that direction.\n\nThe acquaintanceship might, however, have ended in a slow forgetting,\nbut for an incident which occurred at the end of the same week.  One\nafternoon it began to freeze, and the frost increased with evening,\nwhich drew on like a stealthy tightening of bonds.  It was a time\nwhen in cottages the breath of the sleepers freezes to the sheets;\nwhen round the drawing-room fire of a thick-walled mansion the\nsitters' backs are cold, even whilst their faces are all aglow.  Many\na small bird went to bed supperless that night among the bare boughs.\n\nAs the milking-hour drew near, Oak kept his usual watch upon the\ncowshed.  At last he felt cold, and shaking an extra quantity of\nbedding round the yearling ewes he entered the hut and heaped more\nfuel upon the stove.  The wind came in at the bottom of the door,\nand to prevent it Oak laid a sack there and wheeled the cot round a\nlittle more to the south.  Then the wind spouted in at a ventilating\nhole--of which there was one on each side of the hut.\n\nGabriel had always known that when the fire was lighted and the door\nclosed one of these must be kept open--that chosen being always on\nthe side away from the wind.  Closing the slide to windward, he\nturned to open the other; on second thoughts the farmer considered\nthat he would first sit down leaving both closed for a minute or two,\ntill the temperature of the hut was a little raised.  He sat down.\n\nHis head began to ache in an unwonted manner, and, fancying himself\nweary by reason of the broken rests of the preceding nights, Oak\ndecided to get up, open the slide, and then allow himself to fall\nasleep.  He fell asleep, however, without having performed the\nnecessary preliminary.\n\nHow long he remained unconscious Gabriel never knew.  During the\nfirst stages of his return to perception peculiar deeds seemed to be\nin course of enactment.  His dog was howling, his head was aching\nfearfully--somebody was pulling him about, hands were loosening his\nneckerchief.\n\nOn opening his eyes he found that evening had sunk to dusk in\na strange manner of unexpectedness.  The young girl with the\nremarkably pleasant lips and white teeth was beside him.  More than\nthis--astonishingly more--his head was upon her lap, his face and\nneck were disagreeably wet, and her fingers were unbuttoning his\ncollar.\n\n\"Whatever is the matter?\" said Oak, vacantly.\n\nShe seemed to experience mirth, but of too insignificant a kind to\nstart enjoyment.\n\n\"Nothing now,\" she answered, \"since you are not dead. It is a wonder\nyou were not suffocated in this hut of yours.\"\n\n\"Ah, the hut!\" murmured Gabriel.  \"I gave ten pounds for that hut.\nBut I'll sell it, and sit under thatched hurdles as they did in old\ntimes, and curl up to sleep in a lock of straw!  It played me nearly\nthe same trick the other day!\"  Gabriel, by way of emphasis, brought\ndown his fist upon the floor.\n\n\"It was not exactly the fault of the hut,\" she observed in a tone\nwhich showed her to be that novelty among women--one who finished a\nthought before beginning the sentence which was to convey it.  \"You\nshould, I think, have considered, and not have been so foolish as to\nleave the slides closed.\"\n\n\"Yes I suppose I should,\" said Oak, absently.  He was endeavouring to\ncatch and appreciate the sensation of being thus with her, his head\nupon her dress, before the event passed on into the heap of bygone\nthings.  He wished she knew his impressions; but he would as soon\nhave thought of carrying an odour in a net as of attempting to convey\nthe intangibilities of his feeling in the coarse meshes of language.\nSo he remained silent.\n\nShe made him sit up, and then Oak began wiping his face and shaking\nhimself like a Samson.  \"How can I thank 'ee?\" he said at last,\ngratefully, some of the natural rusty red having returned to his\nface.\n\n\"Oh, never mind that,\" said the girl, smiling, and allowing her smile\nto hold good for Gabriel's next remark, whatever that might prove to\nbe.\n\n\"How did you find me?\"\n\n\"I heard your dog howling and scratching at the door of the hut when\nI came to the milking (it was so lucky, Daisy's milking is almost\nover for the season, and I shall not come here after this week or the\nnext).  The dog saw me, and jumped over to me, and laid hold of my\nskirt.  I came across and looked round the hut the very first thing\nto see if the slides were closed.  My uncle has a hut like this one,\nand I have heard him tell his shepherd not to go to sleep without\nleaving a slide open.  I opened the door, and there you were like\ndead.  I threw the milk over you, as there was no water, forgetting\nit was warm, and no use.\"\n\n\"I wonder if I should have died?\" Gabriel said, in a low voice, which\nwas rather meant to travel back to himself than to her.\n\n\"Oh no!\" the girl replied.  She seemed to prefer a less tragic\nprobability; to have saved a man from death involved talk that should\nharmonise with the dignity of such a deed--and she shunned it.\n\n\"I believe you saved my life, Miss--I don't know your name.  I know\nyour aunt's, but not yours.\"\n\n\"I would just as soon not tell it--rather not.  There is no reason\neither why I should, as you probably will never have much to do with\nme.\"\n\n\"Still, I should like to know.\"\n\n\"You can inquire at my aunt's--she will tell you.\"\n\n\"My name is Gabriel Oak.\"\n\n\"And mine isn't.  You seem fond of yours in speaking it so\ndecisively, Gabriel Oak.\"\n\n\"You see, it is the only one I shall ever have, and I must make the\nmost of it.\"\n\n\"I always think mine sounds odd and disagreeable.\"\n\n\"I should think you might soon get a new one.\"\n\n\"Mercy!--how many opinions you keep about you concerning other\npeople, Gabriel Oak.\"\n\n\"Well, Miss--excuse the words--I thought you would like them.  But I\ncan't match you, I know, in mapping out my mind upon my tongue.  I\nnever was very clever in my inside.  But I thank you.  Come, give me\nyour hand.\"\n\nShe hesitated, somewhat disconcerted at Oak's old-fashioned earnest\nconclusion to a dialogue lightly carried on.  \"Very well,\" she\nsaid, and gave him her hand, compressing her lips to a demure\nimpassivity. He held it but an instant, and in his fear of being too\ndemonstrative, swerved to the opposite extreme, touching her fingers\nwith the lightness of a small-hearted person.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" he said the instant after.\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"Letting your hand go so quick.\"\n\n\"You may have it again if you like; there it is.\"  She gave him her\nhand again.\n\nOak held it longer this time--indeed, curiously long.  \"How soft it\nis--being winter time, too--not chapped or rough or anything!\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"There--that's long enough,\" said she, though without pulling it\naway. \"But I suppose you are thinking you would like to kiss it?  You\nmay if you want to.\"\n\n\"I wasn't thinking of any such thing,\" said Gabriel, simply; \"but I\nwill--\"\n\n\"That you won't!\" She snatched back her hand.\n\nGabriel felt himself guilty of another want of tact.\n\n\"Now find out my name,\" she said, teasingly; and withdrew.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nGABRIEL'S RESOLVE--THE VISIT--THE MISTAKE\n\n\nThe only superiority in women that is tolerable to the rival sex is,\nas a rule, that of the unconscious kind; but a superiority which\nrecognizes itself may sometimes please by suggesting possibilities\nof capture to the subordinated man.\n\nThis well-favoured and comely girl soon made appreciable inroads upon\nthe emotional constitution of young Farmer Oak.\n\nLove, being an extremely exacting usurer (a sense of exorbitant\nprofit, spiritually, by an exchange of hearts, being at the bottom of\npure passions, as that of exorbitant profit, bodily or materially,\nis at the bottom of those of lower atmosphere), every morning Oak's\nfeelings were as sensitive as the money-market in calculations upon\nhis chances.  His dog waited for his meals in a way so like that in\nwhich Oak waited for the girl's presence, that the farmer was quite\nstruck with the resemblance, felt it lowering, and would not look at\nthe dog.  However, he continued to watch through the hedge for her\nregular coming, and thus his sentiments towards her were deepened\nwithout any corresponding effect being produced upon herself.  Oak\nhad nothing finished and ready to say as yet, and not being able to\nframe love phrases which end where they begin; passionate tales--\n\n\n         --Full of sound and fury\n      --Signifying nothing--\n\n\nhe said no word at all.\n\nBy making inquiries he found that the girl's name was Bathsheba\nEverdene, and that the cow would go dry in about seven days.  He\ndreaded the eighth day.\n\nAt last the eighth day came.  The cow had ceased to give milk for\nthat year, and Bathsheba Everdene came up the hill no more.  Gabriel\nhad reached a pitch of existence he never could have anticipated\na short time before.  He liked saying \"Bathsheba\" as a private\nenjoyment instead of whistling; turned over his taste to black hair,\nthough he had sworn by brown ever since he was a boy, isolated\nhimself till the space he filled in the public eye was contemptibly\nsmall.  Love is a possible strength in an actual weakness.  Marriage\ntransforms a distraction into a support, the power of which should\nbe, and happily often is, in direct proportion to the degree of\nimbecility it supplants.  Oak began now to see light in this\ndirection, and said to himself, \"I'll make her my wife, or upon my\nsoul I shall be good for nothing!\"\n\nAll this while he was perplexing himself about an errand on which he\nmight consistently visit the cottage of Bathsheba's aunt.\n\nHe found his opportunity in the death of a ewe, mother of a living\nlamb.  On a day which had a summer face and a winter constitution--a\nfine January morning, when there was just enough blue sky visible\nto make cheerfully-disposed people wish for more, and an occasional\ngleam of silvery sunshine, Oak put the lamb into a respectable Sunday\nbasket, and stalked across the fields to the house of Mrs. Hurst, the\naunt--George, the dog walking behind, with a countenance of great\nconcern at the serious turn pastoral affairs seemed to be taking.\n\nGabriel had watched the blue wood-smoke curling from the chimney with\nstrange meditation.  At evening he had fancifully traced it down the\nchimney to the spot of its origin--seen the hearth and Bathsheba\nbeside it--beside it in her out-door dress; for the clothes she had\nworn on the hill were by association equally with her person included\nin the compass of his affection; they seemed at this early time of\nhis love a necessary ingredient of the sweet mixture called Bathsheba\nEverdene.\n\nHe had made a toilet of a nicely-adjusted kind--of a nature between\nthe carefully neat and the carelessly ornate--of a degree between\nfine-market-day and wet-Sunday selection.  He thoroughly cleaned his\nsilver watch-chain with whiting, put new lacing straps to his boots,\nlooked to the brass eyelet-holes, went to the inmost heart of the\nplantation for a new walking-stick, and trimmed it vigorously on his\nway back; took a new handkerchief from the bottom of his clothes-box,\nput on the light waistcoat patterned all over with sprigs of an\nelegant flower uniting the beauties of both rose and lily without the\ndefects of either, and used all the hair-oil he possessed upon his\nusually dry, sandy, and inextricably curly hair, till he had deepened\nit to a splendidly novel colour, between that of guano and Roman\ncement, making it stick to his head like mace round a nutmeg, or wet\nseaweed round a boulder after the ebb.\n\nNothing disturbed the stillness of the cottage save the chatter of a\nknot of sparrows on the eaves; one might fancy scandal and rumour to\nbe no less the staple topic of these little coteries on roofs than of\nthose under them.  It seemed that the omen was an unpropitious one,\nfor, as the rather untoward commencement of Oak's overtures, just\nas he arrived by the garden gate, he saw a cat inside, going into\nvarious arched shapes and fiendish convulsions at the sight of his\ndog George.  The dog took no notice, for he had arrived at an age at\nwhich all superfluous barking was cynically avoided as a waste of\nbreath--in fact, he never barked even at the sheep except to order,\nwhen it was done with an absolutely neutral countenance, as a sort of\nCommination-service, which, though offensive, had to be gone through\nonce now and then to frighten the flock for their own good.\n\nA voice came from behind some laurel-bushes into which the cat had\nrun:\n\n\"Poor dear!  Did a nasty brute of a dog want to kill it;--did he,\npoor dear!\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Oak to the voice, \"but George was walking\non behind me with a temper as mild as milk.\"\n\nAlmost before he had ceased speaking, Oak was seized with a misgiving\nas to whose ear was the recipient of his answer. Nobody appeared, and\nhe heard the person retreat among the bushes.\n\nGabriel meditated, and so deeply that he brought small furrows into\nhis forehead by sheer force of reverie.  Where the issue of an\ninterview is as likely to be a vast change for the worse as for\nthe better, any initial difference from expectation causes nipping\nsensations of failure.  Oak went up to the door a little abashed:\nhis mental rehearsal and the reality had had no common grounds of\nopening.\n\nBathsheba's aunt was indoors.  \"Will you tell Miss Everdene that\nsomebody would be glad to speak to her?\" said Mr. Oak.  (Calling\none's self merely Somebody, without giving a name, is not to be taken\nas an example of the ill-breeding of the rural world: it springs\nfrom a refined modesty, of which townspeople, with their cards and\nannouncements, have no notion whatever.)\n\nBathsheba was out.  The voice had evidently been hers.\n\n\"Will you come in, Mr. Oak?\"\n\n\"Oh, thank 'ee,\" said Gabriel, following her to the fireplace.  \"I've\nbrought a lamb for Miss Everdene.  I thought she might like one to\nrear; girls do.\"\n\n\"She might,\" said Mrs. Hurst, musingly; \"though she's only a visitor\nhere.  If you will wait a minute, Bathsheba will be in.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will wait,\" said Gabriel, sitting down.  \"The lamb isn't\nreally the business I came about, Mrs. Hurst.  In short, I was going\nto ask her if she'd like to be married.\"\n\n\"And were you indeed?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Because if she would, I should be very glad to marry her.\nD'ye know if she's got any other young man hanging about her at all?\"\n\n\"Let me think,\" said Mrs. Hurst, poking the fire superfluously....\n\"Yes--bless you, ever so many young men.  You see, Farmer Oak, she's\nso good-looking, and an excellent scholar besides--she was going to\nbe a governess once, you know, only she was too wild.  Not that her\nyoung men ever come here--but, Lord, in the nature of women, she must\nhave a dozen!\"\n\n\"That's unfortunate,\" said Farmer Oak, contemplating a crack in the\nstone floor with sorrow.  \"I'm only an every-day sort of man, and my\nonly chance was in being the first comer ... Well, there's no use in\nmy waiting, for that was all I came about: so I'll take myself off\nhome-along, Mrs. Hurst.\"\n\nWhen Gabriel had gone about two hundred yards along the down, he\nheard a \"hoi-hoi!\" uttered behind him, in a piping note of more\ntreble quality than that in which the exclamation usually embodies\nitself when shouted across a field.  He looked round, and saw a girl\nracing after him, waving a white handkerchief.\n\nOak stood still--and the runner drew nearer.  It was Bathsheba\nEverdene.  Gabriel's colour deepened: hers was already deep, not, as\nit appeared, from emotion, but from running.\n\n\"Farmer Oak--I--\" she said, pausing for want of breath pulling up in\nfront of him with a slanted face and putting her hand to her side.\n\n\"I have just called to see you,\" said Gabriel, pending her further\nspeech.\n\n\"Yes--I know that,\" she said panting like a robin, her face red and\nmoist from her exertions, like a peony petal before the sun dries off\nthe dew.  \"I didn't know you had come to ask to have me, or I should\nhave come in from the garden instantly.  I ran after you to say--that\nmy aunt made a mistake in sending you away from courting me--\"\n\nGabriel expanded. \"I'm sorry to have made you run so fast, my dear,\"\nhe said, with a grateful sense of favours to come. \"Wait a bit till\nyou've found your breath.\"\n\n\"--It was quite a mistake--aunt's telling you I had a young man\nalready,\" Bathsheba went on.  \"I haven't a sweetheart at all--and I\nnever had one, and I thought that, as times go with women, it was\nSUCH a pity to send you away thinking that I had several.\"\n\n\"Really and truly I am glad to hear that!\" said Farmer Oak, smiling\none of his long special smiles, and blushing with gladness.  He held\nout his hand to take hers, which, when she had eased her side by\npressing it there, was prettily extended upon her bosom to still her\nloud-beating heart.  Directly he seized it she put it behind her, so\nthat it slipped through his fingers like an eel.\n\n\"I have a nice snug little farm,\" said Gabriel, with half a degree\nless assurance than when he had seized her hand.\n\n\"Yes; you have.\"\n\n\"A man has advanced me money to begin with, but still, it will soon\nbe paid off, and though I am only an every-day sort of man, I have\ngot on a little since I was a boy.\"  Gabriel uttered \"a little\" in a\ntone to show her that it was the complacent form of \"a great deal.\"\nHe continued: \"When we be married, I am quite sure I can work twice\nas hard as I do now.\"\n\nHe went forward and stretched out his arm again.  Bathsheba had\novertaken him at a point beside which stood a low stunted holly bush,\nnow laden with red berries.  Seeing his advance take the form of an\nattitude threatening a possible enclosure, if not compression, of her\nperson, she edged off round the bush.\n\n\"Why, Farmer Oak,\" she said, over the top, looking at him with\nrounded eyes, \"I never said I was going to marry you.\"\n\n\"Well--that IS a tale!\" said Oak, with dismay. \"To run after anybody\nlike this, and then say you don't want him!\"\n\n\"What I meant to tell you was only this,\" she said eagerly, and yet\nhalf conscious of the absurdity of the position she had made for\nherself--\"that nobody has got me yet as a sweetheart, instead of my\nhaving a dozen, as my aunt said; I HATE to be thought men's property\nin that way, though possibly I shall be had some day.  Why, if I'd\nwanted you I shouldn't have run after you like this; 'twould have\nbeen the FORWARDEST thing!  But there was no harm in hurrying to\ncorrect a piece of false news that had been told you.\"\n\n\"Oh, no--no harm at all.\"  But there is such a thing as being too\ngenerous in expressing a judgment impulsively, and Oak added with a\nmore appreciative sense of all the circumstances--\"Well, I am not\nquite certain it was no harm.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I hadn't time to think before starting whether I wanted to\nmarry or not, for you'd have been gone over the hill.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Gabriel, freshening again; \"think a minute or two.  I'll\nwait a while, Miss Everdene.  Will you marry me?  Do, Bathsheba.  I\nlove you far more than common!\"\n\n\"I'll try to think,\" she observed, rather more timorously; \"if I can\nthink out of doors; my mind spreads away so.\"\n\n\"But you can give a guess.\"\n\n\"Then give me time.\"  Bathsheba looked thoughtfully into the\ndistance, away from the direction in which Gabriel stood.\n\n\"I can make you happy,\" said he to the back of her head, across the\nbush.  \"You shall have a piano in a year or two--farmers' wives are\ngetting to have pianos now--and I'll practise up the flute right well\nto play with you in the evenings.\"\n\n\"Yes; I should like that.\"\n\n\"And have one of those little ten-pound gigs for market--and nice\nflowers, and birds--cocks and hens I mean, because they be useful,\"\ncontinued Gabriel, feeling balanced between poetry and practicality.\n\n\"I should like it very much.\"\n\n\"And a frame for cucumbers--like a gentleman and lady.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And when the wedding was over, we'd have it put in the newspaper\nlist of marriages.\"\n\n\"Dearly I should like that!\"\n\n\"And the babies in the births--every man jack of 'em!  And at home by\nthe fire, whenever you look up, there I shall be--and whenever I look\nup there will be you.\"\n\n\"Wait, wait, and don't be improper!\"\n\nHer countenance fell, and she was silent awhile.  He regarded the red\nberries between them over and over again, to such an extent, that\nholly seemed in his after life to be a cypher signifying a proposal\nof marriage.  Bathsheba decisively turned to him.\n\n\"No; 'tis no use,\" she said.  \"I don't want to marry you.\"\n\n\"Try.\"\n\n\"I have tried hard all the time I've been thinking; for a marriage\nwould be very nice in one sense.  People would talk about me, and\nthink I had won my battle, and I should feel triumphant, and all\nthat, But a husband--\"\n\n\"Well!\"\n\n\"Why, he'd always be there, as you say; whenever I looked up, there\nhe'd be.\"\n\n\"Of course he would--I, that is.\"\n\n\"Well, what I mean is that I shouldn't mind being a bride at a\nwedding, if I could be one without having a husband.  But since a\nwoman can't show off in that way by herself, I shan't marry--at least\nyet.\"\n\n\"That's a terrible wooden story!\"\n\nAt this criticism of her statement Bathsheba made an addition to her\ndignity by a slight sweep away from him.\n\n\"Upon my heart and soul, I don't know what a maid can say stupider\nthan that,\" said Oak.  \"But dearest,\" he continued in a palliative\nvoice, \"don't be like it!\" Oak sighed a deep honest sigh--none the\nless so in that, being like the sigh of a pine plantation, it was\nrather noticeable as a disturbance of the atmosphere.  \"Why won't you\nhave me?\" he appealed, creeping round the holly to reach her side.\n\n\"I cannot,\" she said, retreating.\n\n\"But why?\" he persisted, standing still at last in despair of ever\nreaching her, and facing over the bush.\n\n\"Because I don't love you.\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\"\n\nShe contracted a yawn to an inoffensive smallness, so that it was\nhardly ill-mannered at all.  \"I don't love you,\" she said.\n\n\"But I love you--and, as for myself, I am content to be liked.\"\n\n\"Oh Mr. Oak--that's very fine!  You'd get to despise me.\"\n\n\"Never,\" said Mr Oak, so earnestly that he seemed to be coming, by\nthe force of his words, straight through the bush and into her arms.\n\"I shall do one thing in this life--one thing certain--that is, love\nyou, and long for you, and KEEP WANTING YOU till I die.\"  His voice\nhad a genuine pathos now, and his large brown hands perceptibly\ntrembled.\n\n\"It seems dreadfully wrong not to have you when you feel so much!\"\nshe said with a little distress, and looking hopelessly around\nfor some means of escape from her moral dilemma.  \"How I wish I\nhadn't run after you!\"  However she seemed to have a short cut for\ngetting back to cheerfulness, and set her face to signify archness.\n\"It wouldn't do, Mr Oak.  I want somebody to tame me; I am too\nindependent; and you would never be able to, I know.\"\n\nOak cast his eyes down the field in a way implying that it was\nuseless to attempt argument.\n\n\"Mr. Oak,\" she said, with luminous distinctness and common sense,\n\"you are better off than I.  I have hardly a penny in the world--I am\nstaying with my aunt for my bare sustenance.  I am better educated\nthan you--and I don't love you a bit: that's my side of the case.\nNow yours: you are a farmer just beginning; and you ought in common\nprudence, if you marry at all (which you should certainly not think\nof doing at present), to marry a woman with money, who would stock a\nlarger farm for you than you have now.\"\n\nGabriel looked at her with a little surprise and much admiration.\n\n\"That's the very thing I had been thinking myself!\" he na\u00c3\u00afvely said.\n\nFarmer Oak had one-and-a-half Christian characteristics too many to\nsucceed with Bathsheba: his humility, and a superfluous moiety of\nhonesty.  Bathsheba was decidedly disconcerted.\n\n\"Well, then, why did you come and disturb me?\" she said, almost\nangrily, if not quite, an enlarging red spot rising in each cheek.\n\n\"I can't do what I think would be--would be--\"\n\n\"Right?\"\n\n\"No: wise.\"\n\n\"You have made an admission NOW, Mr. Oak,\" she exclaimed, with even\nmore hauteur, and rocking her head disdainfully.  \"After that, do you\nthink I could marry you?  Not if I know it.\"\n\nHe broke in passionately.  \"But don't mistake me like that!  Because\nI am open enough to own what every man in my shoes would have thought\nof, you make your colours come up your face, and get crabbed with me.\nThat about your not being good enough for me is nonsense.  You speak\nlike a lady--all the parish notice it, and your uncle at Weatherbury\nis, I have heerd, a large farmer--much larger than ever I shall be.\nMay I call in the evening, or will you walk along with me o' Sundays?\nI don't want you to make-up your mind at once, if you'd rather not.\"\n\n\"No--no--I cannot.  Don't press me any more--don't.  I don't love\nyou--so 'twould be ridiculous,\" she said, with a laugh.\n\nNo man likes to see his emotions the sport of a merry-go-round of\nskittishness.  \"Very well,\" said Oak, firmly, with the bearing of one\nwho was going to give his days and nights to Ecclesiastes for ever.\n\"Then I'll ask you no more.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nDEPARTURE OF BATHSHEBA--A PASTORAL TRAGEDY\n\n\nThe news which one day reached Gabriel, that Bathsheba Everdene\nhad left the neighbourhood, had an influence upon him which might\nhave surprised any who never suspected that the more emphatic the\nrenunciation the less absolute its character.\n\nIt may have been observed that there is no regular path for getting\nout of love as there is for getting in.  Some people look upon\nmarriage as a short cut that way, but it has been known to fail.\nSeparation, which was the means that chance offered to Gabriel Oak by\nBathsheba's disappearance, though effectual with people of certain\nhumours, is apt to idealize the removed object with others--notably\nthose whose affection, placid and regular as it may be, flows deep\nand long.  Oak belonged to the even-tempered order of humanity, and\nfelt the secret fusion of himself in Bathsheba to be burning with a\nfiner flame now that she was gone--that was all.\n\nHis incipient friendship with her aunt had been nipped by the\nfailure of his suit, and all that Oak learnt of Bathsheba's\nmovements was done indirectly.  It appeared that she had gone to\na place called Weatherbury, more than twenty miles off, but in\nwhat capacity--whether as a visitor, or permanently, he could not\ndiscover.\n\nGabriel had two dogs.  George, the elder, exhibited an ebony-tipped\nnose, surrounded by a narrow margin of pink flesh, and a coat marked\nin random splotches approximating in colour to white and slaty\ngrey; but the grey, after years of sun and rain, had been scorched\nand washed out of the more prominent locks, leaving them of a\nreddish-brown, as if the blue component of the grey had faded, like\nthe indigo from the same kind of colour in Turner's pictures.  In\nsubstance it had originally been hair, but long contact with sheep\nseemed to be turning it by degrees into wool of a poor quality and\nstaple.\n\nThis dog had originally belonged to a shepherd of inferior morals\nand dreadful temper, and the result was that George knew the exact\ndegrees of condemnation signified by cursing and swearing of all\ndescriptions better than the wickedest old man in the neighbourhood.\nLong experience had so precisely taught the animal the difference\nbetween such exclamations as \"Come in!\" and \"D---- ye, come in!\" that\nhe knew to a hair's breadth the rate of trotting back from the ewes'\ntails that each call involved, if a staggerer with the sheep crook\nwas to be escaped.  Though old, he was clever and trustworthy still.\n\nThe young dog, George's son, might possibly have been the image\nof his mother, for there was not much resemblance between him and\nGeorge.  He was learning the sheep-keeping business, so as to follow\non at the flock when the other should die, but had got no further\nthan the rudiments as yet--still finding an insuperable difficulty\nin distinguishing between doing a thing well enough and doing it too\nwell.  So earnest and yet so wrong-headed was this young dog (he had\nno name in particular, and answered with perfect readiness to any\npleasant interjection), that if sent behind the flock to help them\non, he did it so thoroughly that he would have chased them across the\nwhole county with the greatest pleasure if not called off or reminded\nwhen to stop by the example of old George.\n\nThus much for the dogs.  On the further side of Norcombe Hill was\na chalk-pit, from which chalk had been drawn for generations, and\nspread over adjacent farms.  Two hedges converged upon it in the form\nof a V, but without quite meeting.  The narrow opening left, which\nwas immediately over the brow of the pit, was protected by a rough\nrailing.\n\nOne night, when Farmer Oak had returned to his house, believing there\nwould be no further necessity for his attendance on the down, he\ncalled as usual to the dogs, previously to shutting them up in the\nouthouse till next morning.  Only one responded--old George; the\nother could not be found, either in the house, lane, or garden.\nGabriel then remembered that he had left the two dogs on the hill\neating a dead lamb (a kind of meat he usually kept from them, except\nwhen other food ran short), and concluding that the young one had\nnot finished his meal, he went indoors to the luxury of a bed, which\nlatterly he had only enjoyed on Sundays.\n\nIt was a still, moist night.  Just before dawn he was assisted in\nwaking by the abnormal reverberation of familiar music.  To the\nshepherd, the note of the sheep-bell, like the ticking of the clock\nto other people, is a chronic sound that only makes itself noticed by\nceasing or altering in some unusual manner from the well-known idle\ntwinkle which signifies to the accustomed ear, however distant, that\nall is well in the fold.  In the solemn calm of the awakening morn\nthat note was heard by Gabriel, beating with unusual violence and\nrapidity.  This exceptional ringing may be caused in two ways--by\nthe rapid feeding of the sheep bearing the bell, as when the flock\nbreaks into new pasture, which gives it an intermittent rapidity,\nor by the sheep starting off in a run, when the sound has a regular\npalpitation.  The experienced ear of Oak knew the sound he now heard\nto be caused by the running of the flock with great velocity.\n\nHe jumped out of bed, dressed, tore down the lane through a foggy\ndawn, and ascended the hill.  The forward ewes were kept apart from\nthose among which the fall of lambs would be later, there being two\nhundred of the latter class in Gabriel's flock.  These two hundred\nseemed to have absolutely vanished from the hill.  There were the\nfifty with their lambs, enclosed at the other end as he had left\nthem, but the rest, forming the bulk of the flock, were nowhere.\nGabriel called at the top of his voice the shepherd's call:\n\n\"Ovey, ovey, ovey!\"\n\nNot a single bleat.  He went to the hedge; a gap had been broken\nthrough it, and in the gap were the footprints of the sheep.  Rather\nsurprised to find them break fence at this season, yet putting it\ndown instantly to their great fondness for ivy in winter-time, of\nwhich a great deal grew in the plantation, he followed through the\nhedge.  They were not in the plantation.  He called again: the\nvalleys and farthest hills resounded as when the sailors invoked the\nlost Hylas on the Mysian shore; but no sheep.  He passed through the\ntrees and along the ridge of the hill.  On the extreme summit, where\nthe ends of the two converging hedges of which we have spoken were\nstopped short by meeting the brow of the chalk-pit, he saw the\nyounger dog standing against the sky--dark and motionless as Napoleon\nat St. Helena.\n\nA horrible conviction darted through Oak.  With a sensation of bodily\nfaintness he advanced: at one point the rails were broken through,\nand there he saw the footprints of his ewes.  The dog came up, licked\nhis hand, and made signs implying that he expected some great reward\nfor signal services rendered.  Oak looked over the precipice.  The\newes lay dead and dying at its foot--a heap of two hundred mangled\ncarcasses, representing in their condition just now at least two\nhundred more.\n\nOak was an intensely humane man: indeed, his humanity often tore in\npieces any politic intentions of his which bordered on strategy, and\ncarried him on as by gravitation.  A shadow in his life had always\nbeen that his flock ended in mutton--that a day came and found every\nshepherd an arrant traitor to his defenseless sheep.  His first\nfeeling now was one of pity for the untimely fate of these gentle\newes and their unborn lambs.\n\nIt was a second to remember another phase of the matter.  The\nsheep were not insured.  All the savings of a frugal life had been\ndispersed at a blow; his hopes of being an independent farmer were\nlaid low--possibly for ever.  Gabriel's energies, patience, and\nindustry had been so severely taxed during the years of his life\nbetween eighteen and eight-and-twenty, to reach his present stage of\nprogress that no more seemed to be left in him.  He leant down upon a\nrail, and covered his face with his hands.\n\nStupors, however, do not last for ever, and Farmer Oak recovered from\nhis.  It was as remarkable as it was characteristic that the one\nsentence he uttered was in thankfulness:--\n\n\"Thank God I am not married: what would SHE have done in the poverty\nnow coming upon me!\"\n\nOak raised his head, and wondering what he could do, listlessly\nsurveyed the scene.  By the outer margin of the Pit was an oval pond,\nand over it hung the attenuated skeleton of a chrome-yellow moon\nwhich had only a few days to last--the morning star dogging her on\nthe left hand.  The pool glittered like a dead man's eye, and as the\nworld awoke a breeze blew, shaking and elongating the reflection of\nthe moon without breaking it, and turning the image of the star to a\nphosphoric streak upon the water.  All this Oak saw and remembered.\n\nAs far as could be learnt it appeared that the poor young dog, still\nunder the impression that since he was kept for running after sheep,\nthe more he ran after them the better, had at the end of his meal\noff the dead lamb, which may have given him additional energy and\nspirits, collected all the ewes into a corner, driven the timid\ncreatures through the hedge, across the upper field, and by main\nforce of worrying had given them momentum enough to break down a\nportion of the rotten railing, and so hurled them over the edge.\n\nGeorge's son had done his work so thoroughly that he was considered\ntoo good a workman to live, and was, in fact, taken and tragically\nshot at twelve o'clock that same day--another instance of the\nuntoward fate which so often attends dogs and other philosophers\nwho follow out a train of reasoning to its logical conclusion, and\nattempt perfectly consistent conduct in a world made up so largely\nof compromise.\n\nGabriel's farm had been stocked by a dealer--on the strength of Oak's\npromising look and character--who was receiving a percentage from the\nfarmer till such time as the advance should be cleared off. Oak found\nthat the value of stock, plant, and implements which were really his\nown would be about sufficient to pay his debts, leaving himself a\nfree man with the clothes he stood up in, and nothing more.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nTHE FAIR--THE JOURNEY--THE FIRE\n\n\nTwo months passed away.  We are brought on to a day in February, on\nwhich was held the yearly statute or hiring fair in the county-town\nof Casterbridge.\n\nAt one end of the street stood from two to three hundred blithe and\nhearty labourers waiting upon Chance--all men of the stamp to whom\nlabour suggests nothing worse than a wrestle with gravitation, and\npleasure nothing better than a renunciation of the same. Among\nthese, carters and waggoners were distinguished by having a piece\nof whip-cord twisted round their hats; thatchers wore a fragment of\nwoven straw; shepherds held their sheep-crooks in their hands; and\nthus the situation required was known to the hirers at a glance.\n\nIn the crowd was an athletic young fellow of somewhat superior\nappearance to the rest--in fact, his superiority was marked enough to\nlead several ruddy peasants standing by to speak to him inquiringly,\nas to a farmer, and to use \"Sir\" as a finishing word.  His answer\nalways was,--\n\n\"I am looking for a place myself--a bailiff's.  Do ye know of anybody\nwho wants one?\"\n\nGabriel was paler now.  His eyes were more meditative, and his\nexpression was more sad.  He had passed through an ordeal of\nwretchedness which had given him more than it had taken away.  He\nhad sunk from his modest elevation as pastoral king into the very\nslime-pits of Siddim; but there was left to him a dignified calm he\nhad never before known, and that indifference to fate which, though\nit often makes a villain of a man, is the basis of his sublimity when\nit does not.  And thus the abasement had been exaltation, and the\nloss gain.\n\nIn the morning a regiment of cavalry had left the town, and a\nsergeant and his party had been beating up for recruits through the\nfour streets.  As the end of the day drew on, and he found himself\nnot hired, Gabriel almost wished that he had joined them, and gone\noff to serve his country.  Weary of standing in the market-place, and\nnot much minding the kind of work he turned his hand to, he decided\nto offer himself in some other capacity than that of bailiff.\n\nAll the farmers seemed to be wanting shepherds.  Sheep-tending was\nGabriel's speciality.  Turning down an obscure street and entering\nan obscurer lane, he went up to a smith's shop.\n\n\"How long would it take you to make a shepherd's crook?\"\n\n\"Twenty minutes.\"\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"Two shillings.\"\n\nHe sat on a bench and the crook was made, a stem being given him into\nthe bargain.\n\nHe then went to a ready-made clothes' shop, the owner of which had a\nlarge rural connection.  As the crook had absorbed most of Gabriel's\nmoney, he attempted, and carried out, an exchange of his overcoat for\na shepherd's regulation smock-frock.\n\nThis transaction having been completed, he again hurried off to the\ncentre of the town, and stood on the kerb of the pavement, as a\nshepherd, crook in hand.\n\nNow that Oak had turned himself into a shepherd, it seemed that\nbailiffs were most in demand.  However, two or three farmers noticed\nhim and drew near.  Dialogues followed, more or less in the subjoined\nform:--\n\n\"Where do you come from?\"\n\n\"Norcombe.\"\n\n\"That's a long way.\n\n\"Fifteen miles.\"\n\n\"Who's farm were you upon last?\"\n\n\"My own.\"\n\nThis reply invariably operated like a rumour of cholera. The\ninquiring farmer would edge away and shake his head dubiously.\nGabriel, like his dog, was too good to be trustworthy, and he never\nmade advance beyond this point.\n\nIt is safer to accept any chance that offers itself, and extemporize\na procedure to fit it, than to get a good plan matured, and wait for\na chance of using it.  Gabriel wished he had not nailed up his\ncolours as a shepherd, but had laid himself out for anything in the\nwhole cycle of labour that was required in the fair.  It grew dusk.\nSome merry men were whistling and singing by the corn-exchange.\nGabriel's hand, which had lain for some time idle in his smock-frock\npocket, touched his flute which he carried there.  Here was an\nopportunity for putting his dearly bought wisdom into practice.\n\nHe drew out his flute and began to play \"Jockey to the Fair\" in the\nstyle of a man who had never known moment's sorrow.  Oak could pipe\nwith Arcadian sweetness, and the sound of the well-known notes\ncheered his own heart as well as those of the loungers.  He played on\nwith spirit, and in half an hour had earned in pence what was a small\nfortune to a destitute man.\n\nBy making inquiries he learnt that there was another fair at\nShottsford the next day.\n\n\"How far is Shottsford?\"\n\n\"Ten miles t'other side of Weatherbury.\"\n\nWeatherbury!  It was where Bathsheba had gone two months before.\nThis information was like coming from night into noon.\n\n\"How far is it to Weatherbury?\"\n\n\"Five or six miles.\"\n\nBathsheba had probably left Weatherbury long before this time, but\nthe place had enough interest attaching to it to lead Oak to choose\nShottsford fair as his next field of inquiry, because it lay in the\nWeatherbury quarter.  Moreover, the Weatherbury folk were by no means\nuninteresting intrinsically.  If report spoke truly they were as\nhardy, merry, thriving, wicked a set as any in the whole county.  Oak\nresolved to sleep at Weatherbury that night on his way to Shottsford,\nand struck out at once into the high road which had been recommended\nas the direct route to the village in question.\n\nThe road stretched through water-meadows traversed by little brooks,\nwhose quivering surfaces were braided along their centres, and\nfolded into creases at the sides; or, where the flow was more\nrapid, the stream was pied with spots of white froth, which rode\non in undisturbed serenity.  On the higher levels the dead and\ndry carcasses of leaves tapped the ground as they bowled along\nhelter-skelter upon the shoulders of the wind, and little birds in\nthe hedges were rustling their feathers and tucking themselves in\ncomfortably for the night, retaining their places if Oak kept moving,\nbut flying away if he stopped to look at them.  He passed by Yalbury\nWood where the game-birds were rising to their roosts, and heard the\ncrack-voiced cock-pheasants \"cu-uck, cuck,\" and the wheezy whistle of\nthe hens.\n\nBy the time he had walked three or four miles every shape in the\nlandscape had assumed a uniform hue of blackness.  He descended\nYalbury Hill and could just discern ahead of him a waggon, drawn up\nunder a great over-hanging tree by the roadside.\n\nOn coming close, he found there were no horses attached to it, the\nspot being apparently quite deserted.  The waggon, from its position,\nseemed to have been left there for the night, for beyond about half\na truss of hay which was heaped in the bottom, it was quite empty.\nGabriel sat down on the shafts of the vehicle and considered his\nposition.  He calculated that he had walked a very fair proportion of\nthe journey; and having been on foot since daybreak, he felt tempted\nto lie down upon the hay in the waggon instead of pushing on to the\nvillage of Weatherbury, and having to pay for a lodging.\n\nEating his last slices of bread and ham, and drinking from the bottle\nof cider he had taken the precaution to bring with him, he got into\nthe lonely waggon.  Here he spread half of the hay as a bed, and,\nas well as he could in the darkness, pulled the other half over\nhim by way of bed-clothes, covering himself entirely, and feeling,\nphysically, as comfortable as ever he had been in his life.  Inward\nmelancholy it was impossible for a man like Oak, introspective far\nbeyond his neighbours, to banish quite, whilst conning the present\nuntoward page of his history.  So, thinking of his misfortunes,\namorous and pastoral, he fell asleep, shepherds enjoying, in common\nwith sailors, the privilege of being able to summon the god instead\nof having to wait for him.\n\nOn somewhat suddenly awaking, after a sleep of whose length he had no\nidea, Oak found that the waggon was in motion.  He was being carried\nalong the road at a rate rather considerable for a vehicle without\nsprings, and under circumstances of physical uneasiness, his\nhead being dandled up and down on the bed of the waggon like a\nkettledrum-stick.  He then distinguished voices in conversation,\ncoming from the forpart of the waggon.  His concern at this dilemma\n(which would have been alarm, had he been a thriving man; but\nmisfortune is a fine opiate to personal terror) led him to peer\ncautiously from the hay, and the first sight he beheld was the stars\nabove him.  Charles's Wain was getting towards a right angle with\nthe Pole star, and Gabriel concluded that it must be about nine\no'clock--in other words, that he had slept two hours.  This small\nastronomical calculation was made without any positive effort, and\nwhilst he was stealthily turning to discover, if possible, into whose\nhands he had fallen.\n\nTwo figures were dimly visible in front, sitting with their legs\noutside the waggon, one of whom was driving.  Gabriel soon found that\nthis was the waggoner, and it appeared they had come from\nCasterbridge fair, like himself.\n\nA conversation was in progress, which continued thus:--\n\n\"Be as 'twill, she's a fine handsome body as far's looks be\nconcerned.  But that's only the skin of the woman, and these dandy\ncattle be as proud as a lucifer in their insides.\"\n\n\"Ay--so 'a do seem, Billy Smallbury--so 'a do seem.\"  This utterance\nwas very shaky by nature, and more so by circumstance, the jolting of\nthe waggon not being without its effect upon the speaker's larynx.\nIt came from the man who held the reins.\n\n\"She's a very vain feymell--so 'tis said here and there.\"\n\n\"Ah, now.  If so be 'tis like that, I can't look her in the face.\nLord, no: not I--heh-heh-heh!  Such a shy man as I be!\"\n\n\"Yes--she's very vain.  'Tis said that every night at going to bed\nshe looks in the glass to put on her night-cap properly.\"\n\n\"And not a married woman.  Oh, the world!\"\n\n\"And 'a can play the peanner, so 'tis said.  Can play so clever that\n'a can make a psalm tune sound as well as the merriest loose song a\nman can wish for.\"\n\n\"D'ye tell o't!  A happy time for us, and I feel quite a new man!\nAnd how do she pay?\"\n\n\"That I don't know, Master Poorgrass.\"\n\nOn hearing these and other similar remarks, a wild thought flashed\ninto Gabriel's mind that they might be speaking of Bathsheba.  There\nwere, however, no grounds for retaining such a supposition, for the\nwaggon, though going in the direction of Weatherbury, might be going\nbeyond it, and the woman alluded to seemed to be the mistress of some\nestate.  They were now apparently close upon Weatherbury and not to\nalarm the speakers unnecessarily, Gabriel slipped out of the waggon\nunseen.\n\nHe turned to an opening in the hedge, which he found to be a gate,\nand mounting thereon, he sat meditating whether to seek a cheap\nlodging in the village, or to ensure a cheaper one by lying under\nsome hay or corn-stack.  The crunching jangle of the waggon died upon\nhis ear.  He was about to walk on, when he noticed on his left hand\nan unusual light--appearing about half a mile distant.  Oak watched\nit, and the glow increased.  Something was on fire.\n\nGabriel again mounted the gate, and, leaping down on the other side\nupon what he found to be ploughed soil, made across the field in the\nexact direction of the fire.  The blaze, enlarging in a double ratio\nby his approach and its own increase, showed him as he drew nearer\nthe outlines of ricks beside it, lighted up to great distinctness.  A\nrick-yard was the source of the fire.  His weary face now began to\nbe painted over with a rich orange glow, and the whole front of his\nsmock-frock and gaiters was covered with a dancing shadow pattern of\nthorn-twigs--the light reaching him through a leafless intervening\nhedge--and the metallic curve of his sheep-crook shone silver-bright\nin the same abounding rays.  He came up to the boundary fence, and\nstood to regain breath.  It seemed as if the spot was unoccupied by\na living soul.\n\nThe fire was issuing from a long straw-stack, which was so far gone\nas to preclude a possibility of saving it.  A rick burns differently\nfrom a house.  As the wind blows the fire inwards, the portion in\nflames completely disappears like melting sugar, and the outline is\nlost to the eye.  However, a hay or a wheat-rick, well put together,\nwill resist combustion for a length of time, if it begins on the\noutside.\n\nThis before Gabriel's eyes was a rick of straw, loosely put together,\nand the flames darted into it with lightning swiftness.  It glowed on\nthe windward side, rising and falling in intensity, like the coal of\na cigar.  Then a superincumbent bundle rolled down, with a whisking\nnoise; flames elongated, and bent themselves about with a quiet\nroar, but no crackle.  Banks of smoke went off horizontally at the\nback like passing clouds, and behind these burned hidden pyres,\nilluminating the semi-transparent sheet of smoke to a lustrous yellow\nuniformity.  Individual straws in the foreground were consumed in a\ncreeping movement of ruddy heat, as if they were knots of red worms,\nand above shone imaginary fiery faces, tongues hanging from lips,\nglaring eyes, and other impish forms, from which at intervals sparks\nflew in clusters like birds from a nest.\n\nOak suddenly ceased from being a mere spectator by discovering the\ncase to be more serious than he had at first imagined.  A scroll\nof smoke blew aside and revealed to him a wheat-rick in startling\njuxtaposition with the decaying one, and behind this a series of\nothers, composing the main corn produce of the farm; so that instead\nof the straw-stack standing, as he had imagined comparatively\nisolated, there was a regular connection between it and the remaining\nstacks of the group.\n\nGabriel leapt over the hedge, and saw that he was not alone.  The\nfirst man he came to was running about in a great hurry, as if his\nthoughts were several yards in advance of his body, which they could\nnever drag on fast enough.\n\n\"O, man--fire, fire!  A good master and a bad servant is fire,\nfire!--I mane a bad servant and a good master.  Oh, Mark Clark--come!\nAnd you, Billy Smallbury--and you, Maryann Money--and you, Jan\nCoggan, and Matthew there!\"  Other figures now appeared behind this\nshouting man and among the smoke, and Gabriel found that, far from\nbeing alone he was in a great company--whose shadows danced merrily\nup and down, timed by the jigging of the flames, and not at all by\ntheir owners' movements.  The assemblage--belonging to that class of\nsociety which casts its thoughts into the form of feeling, and its\nfeelings into the form of commotion--set to work with a remarkable\nconfusion of purpose.\n\n\"Stop the draught under the wheat-rick!\" cried Gabriel to those\nnearest to him.  The corn stood on stone staddles, and between these,\ntongues of yellow hue from the burning straw licked and darted\nplayfully.  If the fire once got UNDER this stack, all would be lost.\n\n\"Get a tarpaulin--quick!\" said Gabriel.\n\nA rick-cloth was brought, and they hung it like a curtain across the\nchannel.  The flames immediately ceased to go under the bottom of the\ncorn-stack, and stood up vertical.\n\n\"Stand here with a bucket of water and keep the cloth wet.\" said\nGabriel again.\n\nThe flames, now driven upwards, began to attack the angles of the\nhuge roof covering the wheat-stack.\n\n\"A ladder,\" cried Gabriel.\n\n\"The ladder was against the straw-rick and is burnt to a cinder,\"\nsaid a spectre-like form in the smoke.\n\nOak seized the cut ends of the sheaves, as if he were going to engage\nin the operation of \"reed-drawing,\" and digging in his feet, and\noccasionally sticking in the stem of his sheep-crook, he clambered up\nthe beetling face.  He at once sat astride the very apex, and began\nwith his crook to beat off the fiery fragments which had lodged\nthereon, shouting to the others to get him a bough and a ladder, and\nsome water.\n\nBilly Smallbury--one of the men who had been on the waggon--by this\ntime had found a ladder, which Mark Clark ascended, holding on beside\nOak upon the thatch.  The smoke at this corner was stifling, and\nClark, a nimble fellow, having been handed a bucket of water, bathed\nOak's face and sprinkled him generally, whilst Gabriel, now with a\nlong beech-bough in one hand, in addition to his crook in the other,\nkept sweeping the stack and dislodging all fiery particles.\n\nOn the ground the groups of villagers were still occupied in doing\nall they could to keep down the conflagration, which was not much.\nThey were all tinged orange, and backed up by shadows of varying\npattern.  Round the corner of the largest stack, out of the direct\nrays of the fire, stood a pony, bearing a young woman on its back.\nBy her side was another woman, on foot.  These two seemed to keep at\na distance from the fire, that the horse might not become restive.\n\n\"He's a shepherd,\" said the woman on foot.  \"Yes--he is. See how his\ncrook shines as he beats the rick with it.  And his smock-frock is\nburnt in two holes, I declare!  A fine young shepherd he is too,\nma'am.\"\n\n\"Whose shepherd is he?\" said the equestrian in a clear voice.\n\n\"Don't know, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Don't any of the others know?\"\n\n\"Nobody at all--I've asked 'em.  Quite a stranger, they say.\"\n\nThe young woman on the pony rode out from the shade and looked\nanxiously around.\n\n\"Do you think the barn is safe?\" she said.\n\n\"D'ye think the barn is safe, Jan Coggan?\" said the second woman,\npassing on the question to the nearest man in that direction.\n\n\"Safe-now--leastwise I think so.  If this rick had gone the barn\nwould have followed.  'Tis that bold shepherd up there that have done\nthe most good--he sitting on the top o' rick, whizzing his great\nlong-arms about like a windmill.\"\n\n\"He does work hard,\" said the young woman on horseback, looking up at\nGabriel through her thick woollen veil.  \"I wish he was shepherd\nhere.  Don't any of you know his name.\"\n\n\"Never heard the man's name in my life, or seed his form afore.\"\n\nThe fire began to get worsted, and Gabriel's elevated position being\nno longer required of him, he made as if to descend.\n\n\"Maryann,\" said the girl on horseback, \"go to him as he comes down,\nand say that the farmer wishes to thank him for the great service he\nhas done.\"\n\nMaryann stalked off towards the rick and met Oak at the foot of the\nladder.  She delivered her message.\n\n\"Where is your master the farmer?\" asked Gabriel, kindling with the\nidea of getting employment that seemed to strike him now.\n\n\"'Tisn't a master; 'tis a mistress, shepherd.\"\n\n\"A woman farmer?\"\n\n\"Ay, 'a b'lieve, and a rich one too!\" said a bystander. \"Lately\n'a came here from a distance.  Took on her uncle's farm, who died\nsuddenly.  Used to measure his money in half-pint cups.  They say\nnow that she've business in every bank in Casterbridge, and thinks\nno more of playing pitch-and-toss sovereign than you and I, do\npitch-halfpenny--not a bit in the world, shepherd.\"\n\n\"That's she, back there upon the pony,\" said Maryann; \"wi' her face\na-covered up in that black cloth with holes in it.\"\n\nOak, his features smudged, grimy, and undiscoverable from the smoke\nand heat, his smock-frock burnt into holes and dripping with water,\nthe ash stem of his sheep-crook charred six inches shorter, advanced\nwith the humility stern adversity had thrust upon him up to the\nslight female form in the saddle.  He lifted his hat with respect,\nand not without gallantry: stepping close to her hanging feet he said\nin a hesitating voice,--\n\n\"Do you happen to want a shepherd, ma'am?\"\n\nShe lifted the wool veil tied round her face, and looked all\nastonishment.  Gabriel and his cold-hearted darling, Bathsheba\nEverdene, were face to face.\n\nBathsheba did not speak, and he mechanically repeated in an abashed\nand sad voice,--\n\n\"Do you want a shepherd, ma'am?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nRECOGNITION--A TIMID GIRL\n\n\nBathsheba withdrew into the shade.  She scarcely knew whether most to\nbe amused at the singularity of the meeting, or to be concerned at\nits awkwardness.  There was room for a little pity, also for a very\nlittle exultation: the former at his position, the latter at her own.\nEmbarrassed she was not, and she remembered Gabriel's declaration of\nlove to her at Norcombe only to think she had nearly forgotten it.\n\n\"Yes,\" she murmured, putting on an air of dignity, and turning again\nto him with a little warmth of cheek; \"I do want a shepherd.  But--\"\n\n\"He's the very man, ma'am,\" said one of the villagers, quietly.\n\nConviction breeds conviction.  \"Ay, that 'a is,\" said a second,\ndecisively.\n\n\"The man, truly!\" said a third, with heartiness.\n\n\"He's all there!\" said number four, fervidly.\n\n\"Then will you tell him to speak to the bailiff,\" said Bathsheba.\n\nAll was practical again now.  A summer eve and loneliness would have\nbeen necessary to give the meeting its proper fulness of romance.\n\nThe bailiff was pointed out to Gabriel, who, checking the palpitation\nwithin his breast at discovering that this Ashtoreth of strange\nreport was only a modification of Venus the well-known and admired,\nretired with him to talk over the necessary preliminaries of hiring.\n\nThe fire before them wasted away.  \"Men,\" said Bathsheba, \"you shall\ntake a little refreshment after this extra work.  Will you come to\nthe house?\"\n\n\"We could knock in a bit and a drop a good deal freer, Miss, if so be\nye'd send it to Warren's Malthouse,\" replied the spokesman.\n\nBathsheba then rode off into the darkness, and the men straggled on\nto the village in twos and threes--Oak and the bailiff being left by\nthe rick alone.\n\n\"And now,\" said the bailiff, finally, \"all is settled, I think, about\nyour coming, and I am going home-along.  Good-night to ye, shepherd.\"\n\n\"Can you get me a lodging?\" inquired Gabriel.\n\n\"That I can't, indeed,\" he said, moving past Oak as a Christian edges\npast an offertory-plate when he does not mean to contribute.  \"If you\nfollow on the road till you come to Warren's Malthouse, where they\nare all gone to have their snap of victuals, I daresay some of 'em\nwill tell you of a place.  Good-night to ye, shepherd.\"\n\nThe bailiff who showed this nervous dread of loving his neighbour as\nhimself, went up the hill, and Oak walked on to the village, still\nastonished at the reencounter with Bathsheba, glad of his nearness to\nher, and perplexed at the rapidity with which the unpractised girl of\nNorcombe had developed into the supervising and cool woman here.  But\nsome women only require an emergency to make them fit for one.\n\nObliged, to some extent, to forgo dreaming in order to find the way,\nhe reached the churchyard, and passed round it under the wall where\nseveral ancient trees grew.  There was a wide margin of grass along\nhere, and Gabriel's footsteps were deadened by its softness, even at\nthis indurating period of the year.  When abreast of a trunk which\nappeared to be the oldest of the old, he became aware that a figure\nwas standing behind it.  Gabriel did not pause in his walk, and in\nanother moment he accidentally kicked a loose stone. The noise was\nenough to disturb the motionless stranger, who started and assumed\na careless position.\n\nIt was a slim girl, rather thinly clad.\n\n\"Good-night to you,\" said Gabriel, heartily.\n\n\"Good-night,\" said the girl to Gabriel.\n\nThe voice was unexpectedly attractive; it was the low and dulcet note\nsuggestive of romance; common in descriptions, rare in experience.\n\n\"I'll thank you to tell me if I'm in the way for Warren's Malthouse?\"\nGabriel resumed, primarily to gain the information, indirectly to get\nmore of the music.\n\n\"Quite right.  It's at the bottom of the hill.  And do you know--\"\nThe girl hesitated and then went on again.  \"Do you know how late\nthey keep open the Buck's Head Inn?\"  She seemed to be won by\nGabriel's heartiness, as Gabriel had been won by her modulations.\n\n\"I don't know where the Buck's Head is, or anything about it.  Do you\nthink of going there to-night?\"\n\n\"Yes--\"  The woman again paused.  There was no necessity for any\ncontinuance of speech, and the fact that she did add more seemed to\nproceed from an unconscious desire to show unconcern by making a\nremark, which is noticeable in the ingenuous when they are acting by\nstealth.  \"You are not a Weatherbury man?\" she said, timorously.\n\n\"I am not.  I am the new shepherd--just arrived.\"\n\n\"Only a shepherd--and you seem almost a farmer by your ways.\"\n\n\"Only a shepherd,\" Gabriel repeated, in a dull cadence of finality.\nHis thoughts were directed to the past, his eyes to the feet of the\ngirl; and for the first time he saw lying there a bundle of some\nsort.  She may have perceived the direction of his face, for she said\ncoaxingly,--\n\n\"You won't say anything in the parish about having seen me here, will\nyou--at least, not for a day or two?\"\n\n\"I won't if you wish me not to,\" said Oak.\n\n\"Thank you, indeed,\" the other replied.  \"I am rather poor, and I\ndon't want people to know anything about me.\"  Then she was silent\nand shivered.\n\n\"You ought to have a cloak on such a cold night,\" Gabriel observed.\n\"I would advise 'ee to get indoors.\"\n\n\"O no!  Would you mind going on and leaving me?  I thank you much for\nwhat you have told me.\"\n\n\"I will go on,\" he said; adding hesitatingly,--\"Since you are not\nvery well off, perhaps you would accept this trifle from me.  It is\nonly a shilling, but it is all I have to spare.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will take it,\" said the stranger gratefully.\n\nShe extended her hand; Gabriel his.  In feeling for each other's palm\nin the gloom before the money could be passed, a minute incident\noccurred which told much.  Gabriel's fingers alighted on the young\nwoman's wrist.  It was beating with a throb of tragic intensity.  He\nhad frequently felt the same quick, hard beat in the femoral artery\nof his lambs when overdriven.  It suggested a consumption too great\nof a vitality which, to judge from her figure and stature, was\nalready too little.\n\n\"What is the matter?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"But there is?\"\n\n\"No, no, no!  Let your having seen me be a secret!\"\n\n\"Very well; I will.  Good-night, again.\"\n\n\"Good-night.\"\n\nThe young girl remained motionless by the tree, and Gabriel descended\ninto the village of Weatherbury, or Lower Longpuddle as it was\nsometimes called.  He fancied that he had felt himself in the\npenumbra of a very deep sadness when touching that slight and fragile\ncreature.  But wisdom lies in moderating mere impressions, and\nGabriel endeavoured to think little of this.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nTHE MALTHOUSE--THE CHAT--NEWS\n\n\nWarren's Malthouse was enclosed by an old wall inwrapped with ivy,\nand though not much of the exterior was visible at this hour, the\ncharacter and purposes of the building were clearly enough shown by\nits outline upon the sky.  From the walls an overhanging thatched\nroof sloped up to a point in the centre, upon which rose a small\nwooden lantern, fitted with louvre-boards on all the four sides,\nand from these openings a mist was dimly perceived to be escaping\ninto the night air.  There was no window in front; but a square\nhole in the door was glazed with a single pane, through which red,\ncomfortable rays now stretched out upon the ivied wall in front.\nVoices were to be heard inside.\n\nOak's hand skimmed the surface of the door with fingers extended to\nan Elymas-the-Sorcerer pattern, till he found a leathern strap, which\nhe pulled.  This lifted a wooden latch, and the door swung open.\n\nThe room inside was lighted only by the ruddy glow from the kiln\nmouth, which shone over the floor with the streaming horizontality\nof the setting sun, and threw upwards the shadows of all facial\nirregularities in those assembled around.  The stone-flag floor was\nworn into a path from the doorway to the kiln, and into undulations\neverywhere.  A curved settle of unplaned oak stretched along one\nside, and in a remote corner was a small bed and bedstead, the owner\nand frequent occupier of which was the maltster.\n\nThis aged man was now sitting opposite the fire, his frosty white\nhair and beard overgrowing his gnarled figure like the grey moss and\nlichen upon a leafless apple-tree.  He wore breeches and the laced-up\nshoes called ankle-jacks; he kept his eyes fixed upon the fire.\n\nGabriel's nose was greeted by an atmosphere laden with the sweet\nsmell of new malt.  The conversation (which seemed to have been\nconcerning the origin of the fire) immediately ceased, and every one\nocularly criticised him to the degree expressed by contracting the\nflesh of their foreheads and looking at him with narrowed eyelids, as\nif he had been a light too strong for their sight.  Several exclaimed\nmeditatively, after this operation had been completed:--\n\n\"Oh, 'tis the new shepherd, 'a b'lieve.\"\n\n\"We thought we heard a hand pawing about the door for the bobbin, but\nweren't sure 'twere not a dead leaf blowed across,\" said another.\n\"Come in, shepherd; sure ye be welcome, though we don't know yer\nname.\"\n\n\"Gabriel Oak, that's my name, neighbours.\"\n\nThe ancient maltster sitting in the midst turned at this--his turning\nbeing as the turning of a rusty crane.\n\n\"That's never Gable Oak's grandson over at Norcombe--never!\" he said,\nas a formula expressive of surprise, which nobody was supposed for a\nmoment to take literally.\n\n\"My father and my grandfather were old men of the name of Gabriel,\"\nsaid the shepherd, placidly.\n\n\"Thought I knowed the man's face as I seed him on the rick!--thought\nI did!  And where be ye trading o't to now, shepherd?\"\n\n\"I'm thinking of biding here,\" said Mr. Oak.\n\n\"Knowed yer grandfather for years and years!\" continued the maltster,\nthe words coming forth of their own accord as if the momentum\npreviously imparted had been sufficient.\n\n\"Ah--and did you!\"\n\n\"Knowed yer grandmother.\"\n\n\"And her too!\"\n\n\"Likewise knowed yer father when he was a child.  Why, my boy\nJacob there and your father were sworn brothers--that they were\nsure--weren't ye, Jacob?\"\n\n\"Ay, sure,\" said his son, a young man about sixty-five, with a\nsemi-bald head and one tooth in the left centre of his upper jaw,\nwhich made much of itself by standing prominent, like a milestone in\na bank.  \"But 'twas Joe had most to do with him.  However, my son\nWilliam must have knowed the very man afore us--didn't ye, Billy,\nafore ye left Norcombe?\"\n\n\"No, 'twas Andrew,\" said Jacob's son Billy, a child of forty, or\nthereabouts, who manifested the peculiarity of possessing a cheerful\nsoul in a gloomy body, and whose whiskers were assuming a chinchilla\nshade here and there.\n\n\"I can mind Andrew,\" said Oak, \"as being a man in the place when I\nwas quite a child.\"\n\n\"Ay--the other day I and my youngest daughter, Liddy, were over at\nmy grandson's christening,\" continued Billy.  \"We were talking about\nthis very family, and 'twas only last Purification Day in this very\nworld, when the use-money is gied away to the second-best poor folk,\nyou know, shepherd, and I can mind the day because they all had to\ntraypse up to the vestry--yes, this very man's family.\"\n\n\"Come, shepherd, and drink.  'Tis gape and swaller with us--a drap of\nsommit, but not of much account,\" said the maltster, removing from\nthe fire his eyes, which were vermilion-red and bleared by gazing\ninto it for so many years.  \"Take up the God-forgive-me, Jacob.  See\nif 'tis warm, Jacob.\"\n\nJacob stooped to the God-forgive-me, which was a two-handled tall mug\nstanding in the ashes, cracked and charred with heat: it was rather\nfurred with extraneous matter about the outside, especially in the\ncrevices of the handles, the innermost curves of which may not have\nseen daylight for several years by reason of this encrustation\nthereon--formed of ashes accidentally wetted with cider and baked\nhard; but to the mind of any sensible drinker the cup was no\nworse for that, being incontestably clean on the inside and about\nthe rim.  It may be observed that such a class of mug is called a\nGod-forgive-me in Weatherbury and its vicinity for uncertain reasons;\nprobably because its size makes any given toper feel ashamed of\nhimself when he sees its bottom in drinking it empty.\n\nJacob, on receiving the order to see if the liquor was warm enough,\nplacidly dipped his forefinger into it by way of thermometer, and\nhaving pronounced it nearly of the proper degree, raised the cup and\nvery civilly attempted to dust some of the ashes from the bottom with\nthe skirt of his smock-frock, because Shepherd Oak was a stranger.\n\n\"A clane cup for the shepherd,\" said the maltster commandingly.\n\n\"No--not at all,\" said Gabriel, in a reproving tone of\nconsiderateness.  \"I never fuss about dirt in its pure state, and\nwhen I know what sort it is.\"  Taking the mug he drank an inch or\nmore from the depth of its contents, and duly passed it to the\nnext man.  \"I wouldn't think of giving such trouble to neighbours\nin washing up when there's so much work to be done in the world\nalready.\" continued Oak in a moister tone, after recovering from the\nstoppage of breath which is occasioned by pulls at large mugs.\n\n\"A right sensible man,\" said Jacob.\n\n\"True, true; it can't be gainsaid!\" observed a brisk young man--Mark\nClark by name, a genial and pleasant gentleman, whom to meet anywhere\nin your travels was to know, to know was to drink with, and to drink\nwith was, unfortunately, to pay for.\n\n\"And here's a mouthful of bread and bacon that mis'ess have sent,\nshepherd.  The cider will go down better with a bit of victuals.\nDon't ye chaw quite close, shepherd, for I let the bacon fall in\nthe road outside as I was bringing it along, and may be 'tis rather\ngritty.  There, 'tis clane dirt; and we all know what that is, as you\nsay, and you bain't a particular man we see, shepherd.\"\n\n\"True, true--not at all,\" said the friendly Oak.\n\n\"Don't let your teeth quite meet, and you won't feel the sandiness at\nall.  Ah! 'tis wonderful what can be done by contrivance!\"\n\n\"My own mind exactly, neighbour.\"\n\n\"Ah, he's his grandfer's own grandson!--his grandfer were just such a\nnice unparticular man!\" said the maltster.\n\n\"Drink, Henry Fray--drink,\" magnanimously said Jan Coggan, a person\nwho held Saint-Simonian notions of share and share alike where liquor\nwas concerned, as the vessel showed signs of approaching him in its\ngradual revolution among them.\n\nHaving at this moment reached the end of a wistful gaze into mid-air,\nHenry did not refuse.  He was a man of more than middle age, with\neyebrows high up in his forehead, who laid it down that the law of\nthe world was bad, with a long-suffering look through his listeners\nat the world alluded to, as it presented itself to his imagination.\nHe always signed his name \"Henery\"--strenuously insisting upon that\nspelling, and if any passing schoolmaster ventured to remark that the\nsecond \"e\" was superfluous and old-fashioned, he received the reply\nthat \"H-e-n-e-r-y\" was the name he was christened and the name he\nwould stick to--in the tone of one to whom orthographical differences\nwere matters which had a great deal to do with personal character.\n\nMr. Jan Coggan, who had passed the cup to Henery, was a crimson man\nwith a spacious countenance and private glimmer in his eye, whose\nname had appeared on the marriage register of Weatherbury and\nneighbouring parishes as best man and chief witness in countless\nunions of the previous twenty years; he also very frequently filled\nthe post of head godfather in baptisms of the subtly-jovial kind.\n\n\"Come, Mark Clark--come.  Ther's plenty more in the barrel,\" said\nJan.\n\n\"Ay--that I will, 'tis my only doctor,\" replied Mr. Clark, who,\ntwenty years younger than Jan Coggan, revolved in the same orbit.  He\nsecreted mirth on all occasions for special discharge at popular\nparties.\n\n\"Why, Joseph Poorgrass, ye han't had a drop!\" said Mr. Coggan to a\nself-conscious man in the background, thrusting the cup towards him.\n\n\"Such a modest man as he is!\" said Jacob Smallbury.  \"Why, ye've\nhardly had strength of eye enough to look in our young mis'ess's\nface, so I hear, Joseph?\"\n\nAll looked at Joseph Poorgrass with pitying reproach.\n\n\"No--I've hardly looked at her at all,\" simpered Joseph, reducing his\nbody smaller whilst talking, apparently from a meek sense of undue\nprominence.  \"And when I seed her, 'twas nothing but blushes with\nme!\"\n\n\"Poor feller,\" said Mr. Clark.\n\n\"'Tis a curious nature for a man,\" said Jan Coggan.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued Joseph Poorgrass--his shyness, which was so painful\nas a defect, filling him with a mild complacency now that it was\nregarded as an interesting study.  \"'Twere blush, blush, blush with\nme every minute of the time, when she was speaking to me.\"\n\n\"I believe ye, Joseph Poorgrass, for we all know ye to be a very\nbashful man.\"\n\n\"'Tis a' awkward gift for a man, poor soul,\" said the maltster.  \"And\nhow long have ye have suffered from it, Joseph?\" [a]\n\n   [Transcriber's note a: Alternate text, appears in all three\n   editions on hand: \"'Tis a' awkward gift for a man, poor soul,\"\n   said the maltster.  \"And ye have suffered from it a long time, we\n   know.\"\n\n   \"Ay, ever since...\"]\n\n\"Oh, ever since I was a boy.  Yes--mother was concerned to her heart\nabout it--yes.  But 'twas all nought.\"\n\n\"Did ye ever go into the world to try and stop it, Joseph Poorgrass?\"\n\n\"Oh ay, tried all sorts o' company.  They took me to Greenhill\nFair, and into a great gay jerry-go-nimble show, where there were\nwomen-folk riding round--standing upon horses, with hardly anything\non but their smocks; but it didn't cure me a morsel.  And then I\nwas put errand-man at the Women's Skittle Alley at the back of the\nTailor's Arms in Casterbridge.  'Twas a horrible sinful situation,\nand a very curious place for a good man.  I had to stand and look\nba'dy people in the face from morning till night; but 'twas no use--I\nwas just as bad as ever after all.  Blushes hev been in the family\nfor generations.  There, 'tis a happy providence that I be no worse.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Jacob Smallbury, deepening his thoughts to a profounder\nview of the subject.  \"'Tis a thought to look at, that ye might have\nbeen worse; but even as you be, 'tis a very bad affliction for 'ee,\nJoseph.  For ye see, shepherd, though 'tis very well for a woman,\ndang it all, 'tis awkward for a man like him, poor feller?\"\n\n\"'Tis--'tis,\" said Gabriel, recovering from a meditation.  \"Yes, very\nawkward for the man.\"\n\n\"Ay, and he's very timid, too,\" observed Jan Coggan.  \"Once he had\nbeen working late at Yalbury Bottom, and had had a drap of drink, and\nlost his way as he was coming home-along through Yalbury Wood, didn't\nye, Master Poorgrass?\"\n\n\"No, no, no; not that story!\" expostulated the modest man, forcing a\nlaugh to bury his concern.\n\n\"--And so 'a lost himself quite,\" continued Mr. Coggan, with an\nimpassive face, implying that a true narrative, like time and tide,\nmust run its course and would respect no man.  \"And as he was coming\nalong in the middle of the night, much afeared, and not able to\nfind his way out of the trees nohow, 'a cried out, 'Man-a-lost!\nman-a-lost!'  A owl in a tree happened to be crying 'Whoo-whoo-whoo!'\nas owls do, you know, shepherd\" (Gabriel nodded), \"and Joseph, all in\na tremble, said, 'Joseph Poorgrass, of Weatherbury, sir!'\"\n\n\"No, no, now--that's too much!\" said the timid man, becoming a man\nof brazen courage all of a sudden.  \"I didn't say SIR.  I'll take my\noath I didn't say 'Joseph Poorgrass o' Weatherbury, sir.'  No, no;\nwhat's right is right, and I never said sir to the bird, knowing very\nwell that no man of a gentleman's rank would be hollering there at\nthat time o' night.  'Joseph Poorgrass of Weatherbury,'--that's every\nword I said, and I shouldn't ha' said that if 't hadn't been for\nKeeper Day's metheglin....  There, 'twas a merciful thing it ended\nwhere it did.\"\n\nThe question of which was right being tacitly waived by the company,\nJan went on meditatively:--\n\n\"And he's the fearfullest man, bain't ye, Joseph?  Ay, another time\nye were lost by Lambing-Down Gate, weren't ye, Joseph?\"\n\n\"I was,\" replied Poorgrass, as if there were some conditions too\nserious even for modesty to remember itself under, this being one.\n\n\"Yes; that were the middle of the night, too.  The gate would not\nopen, try how he would, and knowing there was the Devil's hand in it,\nhe kneeled down.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said Joseph, acquiring confidence from the warmth of the fire,\nthe cider, and a perception of the narrative capabilities of the\nexperience alluded to.  \"My heart died within me, that time; but I\nkneeled down and said the Lord's Prayer, and then the Belief right\nthrough, and then the Ten Commandments, in earnest prayer.  But\nno, the gate wouldn't open; and then I went on with Dearly Beloved\nBrethren, and, thinks I, this makes four, and 'tis all I know out\nof book, and if this don't do it nothing will, and I'm a lost man.\nWell, when I got to Saying After Me, I rose from my knees and found\nthe gate would open--yes, neighbours, the gate opened the same as\never.\"\n\nA meditation on the obvious inference was indulged in by all, and\nduring its continuance each directed his vision into the ashpit,\nwhich glowed like a desert in the tropics under a vertical sun,\nshaping their eyes long and liny, partly because of the light, partly\nfrom the depth of the subject discussed.\n\nGabriel broke the silence.  \"What sort of a place is this to live at,\nand what sort of a mis'ess is she to work under?\" Gabriel's bosom\nthrilled gently as he thus slipped under the notice of the assembly\nthe inner-most subject of his heart.\n\n\"We d' know little of her--nothing.  She only showed herself a few\ndays ago.  Her uncle was took bad, and the doctor was called with his\nworld-wide skill; but he couldn't save the man.  As I take it, she's\ngoing to keep on the farm.\n\n\"That's about the shape o't, 'a b'lieve,\" said Jan Coggan.  \"Ay, 'tis\na very good family.  I'd as soon be under 'em as under one here and\nthere.  Her uncle was a very fair sort of man.  Did ye know en,\nshepherd--a bachelor-man?\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"I used to go to his house a-courting my first wife, Charlotte,\nwho was his dairymaid.  Well, a very good-hearted man were Farmer\nEverdene, and I being a respectable young fellow was allowed to call\nand see her and drink as much ale as I liked, but not to carry away\nany--outside my skin I mane of course.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, Jan Coggan; we know yer maning.\"\n\n\"And so you see 'twas beautiful ale, and I wished to value his\nkindness as much as I could, and not to be so ill-mannered as to\ndrink only a thimbleful, which would have been insulting the man's\ngenerosity--\"\n\n\"True, Master Coggan, 'twould so,\" corroborated Mark Clark.\n\n\"--And so I used to eat a lot of salt fish afore going, and then by\nthe time I got there I were as dry as a lime-basket--so thorough dry\nthat that ale would slip down--ah, 'twould slip down sweet!  Happy\ntimes!  Heavenly times!  Such lovely drunks as I used to have at that\nhouse!  You can mind, Jacob?  You used to go wi' me sometimes.\"\n\n\"I can--I can,\" said Jacob.  \"That one, too, that we had at Buck's\nHead on a White Monday was a pretty tipple.\"\n\n\"'Twas.  But for a wet of the better class, that brought you no\nnearer to the horned man than you were afore you begun, there was\nnone like those in Farmer Everdene's kitchen.  Not a single damn\nallowed; no, not a bare poor one, even at the most cheerful moment\nwhen all were blindest, though the good old word of sin thrown in\nhere and there at such times is a great relief to a merry soul.\"\n\n\"True,\" said the maltster.  \"Nater requires her swearing at the\nregular times, or she's not herself; and unholy exclamations is a\nnecessity of life.\"\n\n\"But Charlotte,\" continued Coggan--\"not a word of the sort would\nCharlotte allow, nor the smallest item of taking in vain....  Ay,\npoor Charlotte, I wonder if she had the good fortune to get into\nHeaven when 'a died!  But 'a was never much in luck's way, and\nperhaps 'a went downwards after all, poor soul.\"\n\n\"And did any of you know Miss Everdene's father and mother?\" inquired\nthe shepherd, who found some difficulty in keeping the conversation\nin the desired channel.\n\n\"I knew them a little,\" said Jacob Smallbury; \"but they were\ntownsfolk, and didn't live here.  They've been dead for years.\nFather, what sort of people were mis'ess' father and mother?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the maltster, \"he wasn't much to look at; but she was a\nlovely woman.  He was fond enough of her as his sweetheart.\"\n\n\"Used to kiss her scores and long-hundreds o' times, so 'twas said,\"\nobserved Coggan.\n\n\"He was very proud of her, too, when they were married, as I've been\ntold,\" said the maltster.\n\n\"Ay,\" said Coggan.  \"He admired her so much that he used to light the\ncandle three times a night to look at her.\"\n\n\"Boundless love; I shouldn't have supposed it in the universe!\"\nmurmured Joseph Poorgrass, who habitually spoke on a large scale in\nhis moral reflections.\n\n\"Well, to be sure,\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"Oh, 'tis true enough.  I knowed the man and woman both well.  Levi\nEverdene--that was the man's name, sure.  'Man,' saith I in my\nhurry, but he were of a higher circle of life than that--'a was a\ngentleman-tailor really, worth scores of pounds.  And he became a\nvery celebrated bankrupt two or three times.\"\n\n\"Oh, I thought he was quite a common man!\" said Joseph.\n\n\"Oh no, no!  That man failed for heaps of money; hundreds in gold and\nsilver.\"\n\nThe maltster being rather short of breath, Mr. Coggan, after absently\nscrutinising a coal which had fallen among the ashes, took up the\nnarrative, with a private twirl of his eye:--\n\n\"Well, now, you'd hardly believe it, but that man--our Miss\nEverdene's father--was one of the ficklest husbands alive, after a\nwhile.  Understand? 'a didn't want to be fickle, but he couldn't help\nit.  The pore feller were faithful and true enough to her in his\nwish, but his heart would rove, do what he would.  He spoke to me in\nreal tribulation about it once.  'Coggan,' he said, 'I could never\nwish for a handsomer woman than I've got, but feeling she's ticketed\nas my lawful wife, I can't help my wicked heart wandering, do what I\nwill.'  But at last I believe he cured it by making her take off her\nwedding-ring and calling her by her maiden name as they sat together\nafter the shop was shut, and so 'a would get to fancy she was only\nhis sweetheart, and not married to him at all.  And as soon as he\ncould thoroughly fancy he was doing wrong and committing the seventh,\n'a got to like her as well as ever, and they lived on a perfect\npicture of mutel love.\"\n\n\"Well, 'twas a most ungodly remedy,\" murmured Joseph Poorgrass; \"but\nwe ought to feel deep cheerfulness that a happy Providence kept it\nfrom being any worse.  You see, he might have gone the bad road and\ngiven his eyes to unlawfulness entirely--yes, gross unlawfulness, so\nto say it.\"\n\n\"You see,\" said Billy Smallbury, \"The man's will was to do right,\nsure enough, but his heart didn't chime in.\"\n\n\"He got so much better, that he was quite godly in his later years,\nwasn't he, Jan?\" said Joseph Poorgrass.  \"He got himself confirmed\nover again in a more serious way, and took to saying 'Amen' almost as\nloud as the clerk, and he liked to copy comforting verses from the\ntombstones.  He used, too, to hold the money-plate at Let Your Light\nso Shine, and stand godfather to poor little come-by-chance children;\nand he kept a missionary box upon his table to nab folks unawares\nwhen they called; yes, and he would box the charity-boys' ears, if\nthey laughed in church, till they could hardly stand upright, and do\nother deeds of piety natural to the saintly inclined.\"\n\n\"Ay, at that time he thought of nothing but high things,\" added Billy\nSmallbury.  \"One day Parson Thirdly met him and said, 'Good-Morning,\nMister Everdene; 'tis a fine day!'  'Amen' said Everdene, quite\nabsent-like, thinking only of religion when he seed a parson.  Yes,\nhe was a very Christian man.\"\n\n\"Their daughter was not at all a pretty chiel at that time,\" said\nHenery Fray.  \"Never should have thought she'd have growed up such a\nhandsome body as she is.\"\n\n\"'Tis to be hoped her temper is as good as her face.\"\n\n\"Well, yes; but the baily will have most to do with the business and\nourselves.  Ah!\" Henery gazed into the ashpit, and smiled volumes of\nironical knowledge.\n\n\"A queer Christian, like the Devil's head in a cowl, [1] as the\nsaying is,\" volunteered Mark Clark.\n\n   [Footnote 1: This phrase is a conjectural emendation of the\n   unintelligible expression, \"as the Devil said to the Owl,\"\n   used by the natives.]\n\n\"He is,\" said Henery, implying that irony must cease at a certain\npoint.  \"Between we two, man and man, I believe that man would as\nsoon tell a lie Sundays as working-days--that I do so.\"\n\n\"Good faith, you do talk!\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"True enough,\" said the man of bitter moods, looking round upon\nthe company with the antithetic laughter that comes from a keener\nappreciation of the miseries of life than ordinary men are capable\nof.  \"Ah, there's people of one sort, and people of another, but\nthat man--bless your souls!\"\n\nGabriel thought fit to change the subject.  \"You must be a very aged\nman, malter, to have sons growed mild and ancient,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Father's so old that 'a can't mind his age, can ye, father?\"\ninterposed Jacob.  \"And he's growed terrible crooked too, lately,\"\nJacob continued, surveying his father's figure, which was rather\nmore bowed than his own.  \"Really one may say that father there is\nthree-double.\"\n\n\"Crooked folk will last a long while,\" said the maltster, grimly, and\nnot in the best humour.\n\n\"Shepherd would like to hear the pedigree of yer life, father--\nwouldn't ye, shepherd?\"\n\n\"Ay that I should,\" said Gabriel with the heartiness of a man who had\nlonged to hear it for several months.  \"What may your age be,\nmalter?\"\n\nThe maltster cleared his throat in an exaggerated form for emphasis,\nand elongating his gaze to the remotest point of the ashpit, said, in\nthe slow speech justifiable when the importance of a subject is so\ngenerally felt that any mannerism must be tolerated in getting at it,\n\"Well, I don't mind the year I were born in, but perhaps I can reckon\nup the places I've lived at, and so get it that way.  I bode at\nUpper Longpuddle across there\" (nodding to the north) \"till I were\neleven. I bode seven at Kingsbere\" (nodding to the east) \"where\nI took to malting.  I went therefrom to Norcombe, and malted\nthere two-and-twenty years, and-two-and-twenty years I was there\nturnip-hoeing and harvesting.  Ah, I knowed that old place, Norcombe,\nyears afore you were thought of, Master Oak\" (Oak smiled sincere\nbelief in the fact).  \"Then I malted at Durnover four year, and\nfour year turnip-hoeing; and I was fourteen times eleven months at\nMillpond St. Jude's\" (nodding north-west-by-north).  \"Old Twills\nwouldn't hire me for more than eleven months at a time, to keep me\nfrom being chargeable to the parish if so be I was disabled.  Then I\nwas three year at Mellstock, and I've been here one-and-thirty year\ncome Candlemas.  How much is that?\"\n\n\"Hundred and seventeen,\" chuckled another old gentleman, given to\nmental arithmetic and little conversation, who had hitherto sat\nunobserved in a corner.\n\n\"Well, then, that's my age,\" said the maltster, emphatically.\n\n\"O no, father!\" said Jacob.  \"Your turnip-hoeing were in the summer\nand your malting in the winter of the same years, and ye don't ought\nto count-both halves, father.\"\n\n\"Chok' it all!  I lived through the summers, didn't I?  That's my\nquestion.  I suppose ye'll say next I be no age at all to speak of?\"\n\n\"Sure we shan't,\" said Gabriel, soothingly.\n\n\"Ye be a very old aged person, malter,\" attested Jan Coggan, also\nsoothingly. \"We all know that, and ye must have a wonderful talented\nconstitution to be able to live so long, mustn't he, neighbours?\"\n\n\"True, true; ye must, malter, wonderful,\" said the meeting\nunanimously.\n\nThe maltster, being now pacified, was even generous enough to\nvoluntarily disparage in a slight degree the virtue of having lived a\ngreat many years, by mentioning that the cup they were drinking out\nof was three years older than he.\n\nWhile the cup was being examined, the end of Gabriel Oak's flute\nbecame visible over his smock-frock pocket, and Henery Fray\nexclaimed, \"Surely, shepherd, I seed you blowing into a great flute\nby now at Casterbridge?\"\n\n\"You did,\" said Gabriel, blushing faintly.  \"I've been in great\ntrouble, neighbours, and was driven to it.  I used not to be so poor\nas I be now.\"\n\n\"Never mind, heart!\" said Mark Clark.  \"You should take it\ncareless-like, shepherd, and your time will come.  But we could thank\nye for a tune, if ye bain't too tired?\"\n\n\"Neither drum nor trumpet have I heard since Christmas,\" said Jan\nCoggan.  \"Come, raise a tune, Master Oak!\"\n\n\"Ay, that I will,\" said Gabriel, pulling out his flute and putting it\ntogether.  \"A poor tool, neighbours; but such as I can do ye shall\nhave and welcome.\"\n\nOak then struck up \"Jockey to the Fair,\" and played that sparkling\nmelody three times through, accenting the notes in the third round in\na most artistic and lively manner by bending his body in small jerks\nand tapping with his foot to beat time.\n\n\"He can blow the flute very well--that 'a can,\" said a young married\nman, who having no individuality worth mentioning was known as \"Susan\nTall's husband.\"  He continued, \"I'd as lief as not be able to blow\ninto a flute as well as that.\"\n\n\"He's a clever man, and 'tis a true comfort for us to have such a\nshepherd,\" murmured Joseph Poorgrass, in a soft cadence.  \"We ought\nto feel full o' thanksgiving that he's not a player of ba'dy songs\ninstead of these merry tunes; for 'twould have been just as easy for\nGod to have made the shepherd a loose low man--a man of iniquity, so\nto speak it--as what he is.  Yes, for our wives' and daughters' sakes\nwe should feel real thanksgiving.\"\n\n\"True, true,--real thanksgiving!\" dashed in Mark Clark conclusively,\nnot feeling it to be of any consequence to his opinion that he had\nonly heard about a word and three-quarters of what Joseph had said.\n\n\"Yes,\" added Joseph, beginning to feel like a man in the Bible; \"for\nevil do thrive so in these times that ye may be as much deceived in\nthe cleanest shaved and whitest shirted man as in the raggedest tramp\nupon the turnpike, if I may term it so.\"\n\n\"Ay, I can mind yer face now, shepherd,\" said Henery Fray,\ncriticising Gabriel with misty eyes as he entered upon his second\ntune.  \"Yes--now I see 'ee blowing into the flute I know 'ee to be\nthe same man I see play at Casterbridge, for yer mouth were scrimped\nup and yer eyes a-staring out like a strangled man's--just as they be\nnow.\"\n\n\"'Tis a pity that playing the flute should make a man look such a\nscarecrow,\" observed Mr. Mark Clark, with additional criticism of\nGabriel's countenance, the latter person jerking out, with the\nghastly grimace required by the instrument, the chorus of \"Dame\nDurden:\"--\n\n   'Twas Moll' and Bet', and Doll' and Kate',\n   And Dor'-othy Drag'-gle Tail'.\n\n\"I hope you don't mind that young man's bad manners in naming your\nfeatures?\" whispered Joseph to Gabriel.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Mr. Oak.\n\n\"For by nature ye be a very handsome man, shepherd,\" continued Joseph\nPoorgrass, with winning sauvity.\n\n\"Ay, that ye be, shepard,\" said the company.\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" said Oak, in the modest tone good manners\ndemanded, thinking, however, that he would never let Bathsheba see\nhim playing the flute; in this resolve showing a discretion equal to\nthat related to its sagacious inventress, the divine Minerva herself.\n\n\"Ah, when I and my wife were married at Norcombe Church,\" said the\nold maltster, not pleased at finding himself left out of the subject,\n\"we were called the handsomest couple in the neighbourhood--everybody\nsaid so.\"\n\n\"Danged if ye bain't altered now, malter,\" said a voice with the\nvigour natural to the enunciation of a remarkably evident truism.\nIt came from the old man in the background, whose offensiveness and\nspiteful ways were barely atoned for by the occasional chuckle he\ncontributed to general laughs.\n\n\"O no, no,\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"Don't ye play no more shepherd\" said Susan Tall's husband, the young\nmarried man who had spoken once before.  \"I must be moving and when\nthere's tunes going on I seem as if hung in wires.  If I thought\nafter I'd left that music was still playing, and I not there, I\nshould be quite melancholy-like.\"\n\n\"What's yer hurry then, Laban?\" inquired Coggan.  \"You used to bide\nas late as the latest.\"\n\n\"Well, ye see, neighbours, I was lately married to a woman, and she's\nmy vocation now, and so ye see--\"  The young man halted lamely.\n\n\"New Lords new laws, as the saying is, I suppose,\" remarked Coggan.\n\n\"Ay, 'a b'lieve--ha, ha!\" said Susan Tall's husband, in a tone\nintended to imply his habitual reception of jokes without minding\nthem at all.  The young man then wished them good-night and withdrew.\n\nHenery Fray was the first to follow.  Then Gabriel arose and went off\nwith Jan Coggan, who had offered him a lodging.  A few minutes later,\nwhen the remaining ones were on their legs and about to depart, Fray\ncame back again in a hurry.  Flourishing his finger ominously he\nthrew a gaze teeming with tidings just where his eye alighted by\naccident, which happened to be in Joseph Poorgrass's face.\n\n\"O--what's the matter, what's the matter, Henery?\" said Joseph,\nstarting back.\n\n\"What's a-brewing, Henrey?\" asked Jacob and Mark Clark.\n\n\"Baily Pennyways--Baily Pennyways--I said so; yes, I said so!\"\n\n\"What, found out stealing anything?\"\n\n\"Stealing it is.  The news is, that after Miss Everdene got home she\nwent out again to see all was safe, as she usually do, and coming in\nfound Baily Pennyways creeping down the granary steps with half a a\nbushel of barley.  She fleed at him like a cat--never such a tomboy\nas she is--of course I speak with closed doors?\"\n\n\"You do--you do, Henery.\"\n\n\"She fleed at him, and, to cut a long story short, he owned to having\ncarried off five sack altogether, upon her promising not to persecute\nhim.  Well, he's turned out neck and crop, and my question is, who's\ngoing to be baily now?\"\n\nThe question was such a profound one that Henery was obliged to drink\nthere and then from the large cup till the bottom was distinctly\nvisible inside.  Before he had replaced it on the table, in came the\nyoung man, Susan Tall's husband, in a still greater hurry.\n\n\"Have ye heard the news that's all over parish?\"\n\n\"About Baily Pennyways?\"\n\n\"But besides that?\"\n\n\"No--not a morsel of it!\" they replied, looking into the very midst\nof Laban Tall as if to meet his words half-way down his throat.\n\n\"What a night of horrors!\" murmured Joseph Poorgrass, waving his\nhands spasmodically.  \"I've had the news-bell ringing in my left ear\nquite bad enough for a murder, and I've seen a magpie all alone!\"\n\n\"Fanny Robin--Miss Everdene's youngest servant--can't be found.\nThey've been wanting to lock up the door these two hours, but she\nisn't come in.  And they don't know what to do about going to bed for\nfear of locking her out.  They wouldn't be so concerned if she hadn't\nbeen noticed in such low spirits these last few days, and Maryann d'\nthink the beginning of a crowner's inquest has happened to the poor\ngirl.\"\n\n\"Oh--'tis burned--'tis burned!\" came from Joseph Poorgrass's dry\nlips.\n\n\"No--'tis drowned!\" said Tall.\n\n\"Or 'tis her father's razor!\" suggested Billy Smallbury, with a vivid\nsense of detail.\n\n\"Well--Miss Everdene wants to speak to one or two of us before we go\nto bed.  What with this trouble about the baily, and now about the\ngirl, mis'ess is almost wild.\"\n\nThey all hastened up the lane to the farmhouse, excepting the old\nmaltster, whom neither news, fire, rain, nor thunder could draw from\nhis hole.  There, as the others' footsteps died away he sat down\nagain and continued gazing as usual into the furnace with his red,\nbleared eyes.\n\nFrom the bedroom window above their heads Bathsheba's head and\nshoulders, robed in mystic white, were dimly seen extended into the\nair.\n\n\"Are any of my men among you?\" she said anxiously.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, several,\" said Susan Tall's husband.\n\n\"To-morrow morning I wish two or three of you to make inquiries in\nthe villages round if they have seen such a person as Fanny Robin.\nDo it quietly; there is no reason for alarm as yet.  She must have\nleft whilst we were all at the fire.\"\n\n\"I beg yer pardon, but had she any young man courting her in the\nparish, ma'am?\" asked Jacob Smallbury.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Bathsheba.\n\n\"I've never heard of any such thing, ma'am,\" said two or three.\n\n\"It is hardly likely, either,\" continued Bathsheba.  \"For any lover\nof hers might have come to the house if he had been a respectable\nlad.  The most mysterious matter connected with her absence--indeed,\nthe only thing which gives me serious alarm--is that she was seen\nto go out of the house by Maryann with only her indoor working gown\non--not even a bonnet.\"\n\n\"And you mean, ma'am, excusing my words, that a young woman would\nhardly go to see her young man without dressing up,\" said Jacob,\nturning his mental vision upon past experiences.  \"That's true--she\nwould not, ma'am.\"\n\n\"She had, I think, a bundle, though I couldn't see very well,\" said a\nfemale voice from another window, which seemed that of Maryann.  \"But\nshe had no young man about here.  Hers lives in Casterbridge, and I\nbelieve he's a soldier.\"\n\n\"Do you know his name?\" Bathsheba said.\n\n\"No, mistress; she was very close about it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I might be able to find out if I went to Casterbridge\nbarracks,\" said William Smallbury.\n\n\"Very well; if she doesn't return to-morrow, mind you go there and try\nto discover which man it is, and see him.  I feel more responsible\nthan I should if she had had any friends or relations alive.  I do\nhope she has come to no harm through a man of that kind....  And then\nthere's this disgraceful affair of the bailiff--but I can't speak of\nhim now.\"\n\nBathsheba had so many reasons for uneasiness that it seemed she did\nnot think it worth while to dwell upon any particular one.  \"Do as I\ntold you, then,\" she said in conclusion, closing the casement.\n\n\"Ay, ay, mistress; we will,\" they replied, and moved away.\n\nThat night at Coggan's, Gabriel Oak, beneath the screen of closed\neyelids, was busy with fancies, and full of movement, like a river\nflowing rapidly under its ice.  Night had always been the time at\nwhich he saw Bathsheba most vividly, and through the slow hours\nof shadow he tenderly regarded her image now.  It is rarely that\nthe pleasures of the imagination will compensate for the pain of\nsleeplessness, but they possibly did with Oak to-night, for the\ndelight of merely seeing her effaced for the time his perception\nof the great difference between seeing and possessing.\n\nHe also thought of plans for fetching his few utensils and books from\nNorcombe.  _The Young Man's Best Companion_, _The Farrier's Sure\nGuide_, _The Veterinary Surgeon_, _Paradise Lost_, _The Pilgrim's\nProgress_, _Robinson Crusoe_, Ash's _Dictionary_, and Walkingame's\n_Arithmetic_, constituted his library; and though a limited series,\nit was one from which he had acquired more sound information by\ndiligent perusal than many a man of opportunities has done from a\nfurlong of laden shelves.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nTHE HOMESTEAD--A VISITOR--HALF-CONFIDENCES\n\n\nBy daylight, the bower of Oak's new-found mistress, Bathsheba\nEverdene, presented itself as a hoary building, of the early stage of\nClassic Renaissance as regards its architecture, and of a proportion\nwhich told at a glance that, as is so frequently the case, it had\nonce been the memorial hall upon a small estate around it, now\naltogether effaced as a distinct property, and merged in the vast\ntract of a non-resident landlord, which comprised several such modest\ndemesnes.\n\nFluted pilasters, worked from the solid stone, decorated its front,\nand above the roof the chimneys were panelled or columnar, some coped\ngables with finials and like features still retaining traces of their\nGothic extraction.  Soft brown mosses, like faded velveteen, formed\ncushions upon the stone tiling, and tufts of the houseleek or\nsengreen sprouted from the eaves of the low surrounding buildings.  A\ngravel walk leading from the door to the road in front was encrusted\nat the sides with more moss--here it was a silver-green variety, the\nnut-brown of the gravel being visible to the width of only a foot\nor two in the centre.  This circumstance, and the generally sleepy\nair of the whole prospect here, together with the animated and\ncontrasting state of the reverse fa\u00c3\u00a7ade, suggested to the imagination\nthat on the adaptation of the building for farming purposes the\nvital principle of the house had turned round inside its body to\nface the other way.  Reversals of this kind, strange deformities,\ntremendous paralyses, are often seen to be inflicted by trade upon\nedifices--either individual or in the aggregate as streets and\ntowns--which were originally planned for pleasure alone.\n\nLively voices were heard this morning in the upper rooms, the\nmain staircase to which was of hard oak, the balusters, heavy as\nbed-posts, being turned and moulded in the quaint fashion of their\ncentury, the handrail as stout as a parapet-top, and the stairs\nthemselves continually twisting round like a person trying to look\nover his shoulder.  Going up, the floors above were found to have a\nvery irregular surface, rising to ridges, sinking into valleys; and\nbeing just then uncarpeted, the face of the boards was seen to be\neaten into innumerable vermiculations.  Every window replied by a\nclang to the opening and shutting of every door, a tremble followed\nevery bustling movement, and a creak accompanied a walker about the\nhouse, like a spirit, wherever he went.\n\nIn the room from which the conversation proceeded Bathsheba and her\nservant-companion, Liddy Smallbury, were to be discovered sitting\nupon the floor, and sorting a complication of papers, books, bottles,\nand rubbish spread out thereon--remnants from the household stores\nof the late occupier.  Liddy, the maltster's great-granddaughter,\nwas about Bathsheba's equal in age, and her face was a prominent\nadvertisement of the light-hearted English country girl.  The beauty\nher features might have lacked in form was amply made up for by\nperfection of hue, which at this winter-time was the softened\nruddiness on a surface of high rotundity that we meet with in a\nTerburg or a Gerard Douw; and, like the presentations of those great\ncolourists, it was a face which kept well back from the boundary\nbetween comeliness and the ideal.  Though elastic in nature she was\nless daring than Bathsheba, and occasionally showed some earnestness,\nwhich consisted half of genuine feeling, and half of mannerliness\nsuperadded by way of duty.\n\nThrough a partly-opened door the noise of a scrubbing-brush led up to\nthe charwoman, Maryann Money, a person who for a face had a circular\ndisc, furrowed less by age than by long gazes of perplexity at\ndistant objects.  To think of her was to get good-humoured; to speak\nof her was to raise the image of a dried Normandy pippin.\n\n\"Stop your scrubbing a moment,\" said Bathsheba through the door to\nher.  \"I hear something.\"\n\nMaryann suspended the brush.\n\nThe tramp of a horse was apparent, approaching the front of the\nbuilding.  The paces slackened, turned in at the wicket, and, what\nwas most unusual, came up the mossy path close to the door.  The door\nwas tapped with the end of a crop or stick.\n\n\"What impertinence!\" said Liddy, in a low voice.  \"To ride up the\nfootpath like that!  Why didn't he stop at the gate? Lord!  'Tis a\ngentleman!  I see the top of his hat.\"\n\n\"Be quiet!\" said Bathsheba.\n\nThe further expression of Liddy's concern was continued by aspect\ninstead of narrative.\n\n\"Why doesn't Mrs. Coggan go to the door?\" Bathsheba continued.\n\nRat-tat-tat-tat resounded more decisively from Bathsheba's oak.\n\n\"Maryann, you go!\" said she, fluttering under the onset of a crowd of\nromantic possibilities.\n\n\"Oh ma'am--see, here's a mess!\"\n\nThe argument was unanswerable after a glance at Maryann.\n\n\"Liddy--you must,\" said Bathsheba.\n\nLiddy held up her hands and arms, coated with dust from the rubbish\nthey were sorting, and looked imploringly at her mistress.\n\n\"There--Mrs. Coggan is going!\" said Bathsheba, exhaling her relief\nin the form of a long breath which had lain in her bosom a minute or\nmore.\n\nThe door opened, and a deep voice said--\n\n\"Is Miss Everdene at home?\"\n\n\"I'll see, sir,\" said Mrs. Coggan, and in a minute appeared in the\nroom.\n\n\"Dear, what a thirtover place this world is!\" continued Mrs. Coggan\n(a wholesome-looking lady who had a voice for each class of remark\naccording to the emotion involved; who could toss a pancake or twirl\na mop with the accuracy of pure mathematics, and who at this moment\nshowed hands shaggy with fragments of dough and arms encrusted with\nflour).  \"I am never up to my elbows, Miss, in making a pudding but\none of two things do happen--either my nose must needs begin\ntickling, and I can't live without scratching it, or somebody knocks\nat the door.  Here's Mr. Boldwood wanting to see you, Miss Everdene.\"\n\nA woman's dress being a part of her countenance, and any disorder in\nthe one being of the same nature with a malformation or wound in the\nother, Bathsheba said at once--\n\n\"I can't see him in this state.  Whatever shall I do?\"\n\nNot-at-homes were hardly naturalized in Weatherbury farmhouses, so\nLiddy suggested--\"Say you're a fright with dust, and can't come\ndown.\"\n\n\"Yes--that sounds very well,\" said Mrs. Coggan, critically.\n\n\"Say I can't see him--that will do.\"\n\nMrs. Coggan went downstairs, and returned the answer as requested,\nadding, however, on her own responsibility, \"Miss is dusting bottles,\nsir, and is quite a object--that's why 'tis.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" said the deep voice indifferently.  \"All I wanted to\nask was, if anything had been heard of Fanny Robin?\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir--but we may know to-night.  William Smallbury is gone\nto Casterbridge, where her young man lives, as is supposed, and the\nother men be inquiring about everywhere.\"\n\nThe horse's tramp then recommenced and retreated, and the door\nclosed.\n\n\"Who is Mr. Boldwood?\" said Bathsheba.\n\n\"A gentleman-farmer at Little Weatherbury.\"\n\n\"Married?\"\n\n\"No, miss.\"\n\n\"How old is he?\"\n\n\"Forty, I should say--very handsome--rather stern-looking--and rich.\"\n\n\"What a bother this dusting is!  I am always in some unfortunate\nplight or other,\" Bathsheba said, complainingly.  \"Why should he\ninquire about Fanny?\"\n\n\"Oh, because, as she had no friends in her childhood, he took her and\nput her to school, and got her her place here under your uncle.  He's\na very kind man that way, but Lord--there!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Never was such a hopeless man for a woman!  He's been courted by\nsixes and sevens--all the girls, gentle and simple, for miles round,\nhave tried him.  Jane Perkins worked at him for two months like a\nslave, and the two Miss Taylors spent a year upon him, and he cost\nFarmer Ives's daughter nights of tears and twenty pounds' worth of\nnew clothes; but Lord--the money might as well have been thrown out\nof the window.\"\n\nA little boy came up at this moment and looked in upon them.  This\nchild was one of the Coggans, who, with the Smallburys, were as\ncommon among the families of this district as the Avons and Derwents\namong our rivers.  He always had a loosened tooth or a cut finger to\nshow to particular friends, which he did with an air of being thereby\nelevated above the common herd of afflictionless humanity--to which\nexhibition people were expected to say \"Poor child!\" with a dash of\ncongratulation as well as pity.\n\n\"I've got a pen-nee!\" said Master Coggan in a scanning measure.\n\n\"Well--who gave it you, Teddy?\" said Liddy.\n\n\"Mis-terr Bold-wood!  He gave it to me for opening the gate.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"He said, 'Where are you going, my little man?' and I said, 'To Miss\nEverdene's please,' and he said, 'She is a staid woman, isn't she, my\nlittle man?' and I said, 'Yes.'\"\n\n\"You naughty child!  What did you say that for?\"\n\n\"'Cause he gave me the penny!\"\n\n\"What a pucker everything is in!\" said Bathsheba, discontentedly\nwhen the child had gone.  \"Get away, Maryann, or go on with your\nscrubbing, or do something!  You ought to be married by this time,\nand not here troubling me!\"\n\n\"Ay, mistress--so I did.  But what between the poor men I won't have,\nand the rich men who won't have me, I stand as a pelican in the\nwilderness!\"\n\n\"Did anybody ever want to marry you miss?\" Liddy ventured to ask when\nthey were again alone.  \"Lots of 'em, I daresay?\"\n\nBathsheba paused, as if about to refuse a reply, but the temptation\nto say yes, since it was really in her power was irresistible by\naspiring virginity, in spite of her spleen at having been published\nas old.\n\n\"A man wanted to once,\" she said, in a highly experienced tone, and\nthe image of Gabriel Oak, as the farmer, rose before her.\n\n\"How nice it must seem!\" said Liddy, with the fixed features of\nmental realization.  \"And you wouldn't have him?\"\n\n\"He wasn't quite good enough for me.\"\n\n\"How sweet to be able to disdain, when most of us are glad to say,\n'Thank you!'  I seem I hear it.  'No, sir--I'm your better.' or 'Kiss\nmy foot, sir; my face is for mouths of consequence.'  And did you\nlove him, miss?\"\n\n\"Oh, no.  But I rather liked him.\"\n\n\"Do you now?\"\n\n\"Of course not--what footsteps are those I hear?\"\n\nLiddy looked from a back window into the courtyard behind, which was\nnow getting low-toned and dim with the earliest films of night.  A\ncrooked file of men was approaching the back door.  The whole string\nof trailing individuals advanced in the completest balance of\nintention, like the remarkable creatures known as Chain Salp\u00c3\u00a6, which,\ndistinctly organized in other respects, have one will common to a\nwhole family.  Some were, as usual, in snow-white smock-frocks of\nRussia duck, and some in whitey-brown ones of drabbet--marked on the\nwrists, breasts, backs, and sleeves with honeycomb-work.  Two or\nthree women in pattens brought up the rear.\n\n\"The Philistines be upon us,\" said Liddy, making her nose white\nagainst the glass.\n\n\"Oh, very well.  Maryann, go down and keep them in the kitchen till I\nam dressed, and then show them in to me in the hall.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nMISTRESS AND MEN\n\n\nHalf-an-hour later Bathsheba, in finished dress, and followed by\nLiddy, entered the upper end of the old hall to find that her men had\nall deposited themselves on a long form and a settle at the lower\nextremity.  She sat down at a table and opened the time-book, pen in\nher hand, with a canvas money-bag beside her.  From this she poured\na small heap of coin.  Liddy chose a position at her elbow and began\nto sew, sometimes pausing and looking round, or, with the air of\na privileged person, taking up one of the half-sovereigns lying\nbefore her and surveying it merely as a work of art, while strictly\npreventing her countenance from expressing any wish to possess it as\nmoney.\n\n\"Now before I begin, men,\" said Bathsheba, \"I have two matters to\nspeak of.  The first is that the bailiff is dismissed for thieving,\nand that I have formed a resolution to have no bailiff at all, but to\nmanage everything with my own head and hands.\"\n\nThe men breathed an audible breath of amazement.\n\n\"The next matter is, have you heard anything of Fanny?\"\n\n\"Nothing, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Have you done anything?\"\n\n\"I met Farmer Boldwood,\" said Jacob Smallbury, \"and I went with him\nand two of his men, and dragged Newmill Pond, but we found nothing.\"\n\n\"And the new shepherd have been to Buck's Head, by Yalbury, thinking\nshe had gone there, but nobody had seed her,\" said Laban Tall.\n\n\"Hasn't William Smallbury been to Casterbridge?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, but he's not yet come home.  He promised to be back by\nsix.\"\n\n\"It wants a quarter to six at present,\" said Bathsheba, looking at\nher watch.  \"I daresay he'll be in directly.  Well, now then\"--she\nlooked into the book--\"Joseph Poorgrass, are you there?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir--ma'am I mane,\" said the person addressed.  \"I be the\npersonal name of Poorgrass.\"\n\n\"And what are you?\"\n\n\"Nothing in my own eye.  In the eye of other people--well, I don't\nsay it; though public thought will out.\"\n\n\"What do you do on the farm?\"\n\n\"I do do carting things all the year, and in seed time I shoots the\nrooks and sparrows, and helps at pig-killing, sir.\"\n\n\"How much to you?\"\n\n\"Please nine and ninepence and a good halfpenny where 'twas a bad\none, sir--ma'am I mane.\"\n\n\"Quite correct.  Now here are ten shillings in addition as a small\npresent, as I am a new comer.\"\n\nBathsheba blushed slightly at the sense of being generous in public,\nand Henery Fray, who had drawn up towards her chair, lifted his\neyebrows and fingers to express amazement on a small scale.\n\n\"How much do I owe you--that man in the corner--what's your name?\"\ncontinued Bathsheba.\n\n\"Matthew Moon, ma'am,\" said a singular framework of clothes with\nnothing of any consequence inside them, which advanced with the toes\nin no definite direction forwards, but turned in or out as they\nchanced to swing.\n\n\"Matthew Mark, did you say?--speak out--I shall not hurt you,\"\ninquired the young farmer, kindly.\n\n\"Matthew Moon, mem,\" said Henery Fray, correctingly, from behind her\nchair, to which point he had edged himself.\n\n\"Matthew Moon,\" murmured Bathsheba, turning her bright eyes to the\nbook.  \"Ten and twopence halfpenny is the sum put down to you, I\nsee?\"\n\n\"Yes, mis'ess,\" said Matthew, as the rustle of wind among dead\nleaves.\n\n\"Here it is, and ten shillings.  Now the next--Andrew Randle, you are\na new man, I hear.  How come you to leave your last farm?\"\n\n\"P-p-p-p-p-pl-pl-pl-pl-l-l-l-l-ease, ma'am, p-p-p-p-pl-pl-pl-pl-please,\nma'am-please'm-please'm--\"\n\n\"'A's a stammering man, mem,\" said Henery Fray in an undertone, \"and\nthey turned him away because the only time he ever did speak plain\nhe said his soul was his own, and other iniquities, to the squire.\n'A can cuss, mem, as well as you or I, but 'a can't speak a common\nspeech to save his life.\"\n\n\"Andrew Randle, here's yours--finish thanking me in a day or two.\nTemperance Miller--oh, here's another, Soberness--both women I\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"Yes'm.  Here we be, 'a b'lieve,\" was echoed in shrill unison.\n\n\"What have you been doing?\"\n\n\"Tending thrashing-machine and wimbling haybonds, and saying 'Hoosh!'\nto the cocks and hens when they go upon your seeds, and planting\nEarly Flourballs and Thompson's Wonderfuls with a dibble.\"\n\n\"Yes--I see.  Are they satisfactory women?\" she inquired softly of\nHenery Fray.\n\n\"Oh mem--don't ask me!  Yielding women--as scarlet a pair as ever\nwas!\" groaned Henery under his breath.\n\n\"Sit down.\"\n\n\"Who, mem?\"\n\n\"Sit down.\"\n\nJoseph Poorgrass, in the background twitched, and his lips became\ndry with fear of some terrible consequences, as he saw Bathsheba\nsummarily speaking, and Henery slinking off to a corner.\n\n\"Now the next.  Laban Tall, you'll stay on working for me?\"\n\n\"For you or anybody that pays me well, ma'am,\" replied the young\nmarried man.\n\n\"True--the man must live!\" said a woman in the back quarter, who had\njust entered with clicking pattens.\n\n\"What woman is that?\" Bathsheba asked.\n\n\"I be his lawful wife!\" continued the voice with greater prominence\nof manner and tone.  This lady called herself five-and-twenty, looked\nthirty, passed as thirty-five, and was forty.  She was a woman who\nnever, like some newly married, showed conjugal tenderness in public,\nperhaps because she had none to show.\n\n\"Oh, you are,\" said Bathsheba.  \"Well, Laban, will you stay on?\"\n\n\"Yes, he'll stay, ma'am!\" said again the shrill tongue of Laban's\nlawful wife.\n\n\"Well, he can speak for himself, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Oh Lord, not he, ma'am!  A simple tool.  Well enough, but a poor\ngawkhammer mortal,\" the wife replied.\n\n\"Heh-heh-heh!\" laughed the married man with a hideous effort of\nappreciation, for he was as irrepressibly good-humoured under ghastly\nsnubs as a parliamentary candidate on the hustings.\n\nThe names remaining were called in the same manner.\n\n\"Now I think I have done with you,\" said Bathsheba, closing the book\nand shaking back a stray twine of hair.  \"Has William Smallbury\nreturned?\"\n\n\"No, ma'am.\"\n\n\"The new shepherd will want a man under him,\" suggested Henery Fray,\ntrying to make himself official again by a sideway approach towards\nher chair.\n\n\"Oh--he will.  Who can he have?\"\n\n\"Young Cain Ball is a very good lad,\" Henery said, \"and Shepherd Oak\ndon't mind his youth?\" he added, turning with an apologetic smile to\nthe shepherd, who had just appeared on the scene, and was now leaning\nagainst the doorpost with his arms folded.\n\n\"No, I don't mind that,\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"How did Cain come by such a name?\" asked Bathsheba.\n\n\"Oh you see, mem, his pore mother, not being a Scripture-read woman,\nmade a mistake at his christening, thinking 'twas Abel killed Cain,\nand called en Cain, meaning Abel all the time.  The parson put it\nright, but 'twas too late, for the name could never be got rid of in\nthe parish.  'Tis very unfortunate for the boy.\"\n\n\"It is rather unfortunate.\"\n\n\"Yes.  However, we soften it down as much as we can, and call him\nCainy.  Ah, pore widow-woman! she cried her heart out about it\nalmost.  She was brought up by a very heathen father and mother, who\nnever sent her to church or school, and it shows how the sins of the\nparents are visited upon the children, mem.\"\n\nMr. Fray here drew up his features to the mild degree of melancholy\nrequired when the persons involved in the given misfortune do not\nbelong to your own family.\n\n\"Very well then, Cainey Ball to be under-shepherd.  And you quite\nunderstand your duties?--you I mean, Gabriel Oak?\"\n\n\"Quite well, I thank you, Miss Everdene,\" said Shepherd Oak from the\ndoorpost.  \"If I don't, I'll inquire.\"  Gabriel was rather staggered\nby the remarkable coolness of her manner.  Certainly nobody without\nprevious information would have dreamt that Oak and the handsome\nwoman before whom he stood had ever been other than strangers.  But\nperhaps her air was the inevitable result of the social rise which\nhad advanced her from a cottage to a large house and fields.  The\ncase is not unexampled in high places.  When, in the writings of the\nlater poets, Jove and his family are found to have moved from their\ncramped quarters on the peak of Olympus into the wide sky above it,\ntheir words show a proportionate increase of arrogance and reserve.\n\nFootsteps were heard in the passage, combining in their character\nthe qualities both of weight and measure, rather at the expense of\nvelocity.\n\n(All.) \"Here's Billy Smallbury come from Casterbridge.\"\n\n\"And what's the news?\" said Bathsheba, as William, after marching to\nthe middle of the hall, took a handkerchief from his hat and wiped\nhis forehead from its centre to its remoter boundaries.\n\n\"I should have been sooner, miss,\" he said, \"if it hadn't been for\nthe weather.\"  He then stamped with each foot severely, and on\nlooking down his boots were perceived to be clogged with snow.\n\n\"Come at last, is it?\" said Henery.\n\n\"Well, what about Fanny?\" said Bathsheba.\n\n\"Well, ma'am, in round numbers, she's run away with the soldiers,\"\nsaid William.\n\n\"No; not a steady girl like Fanny!\"\n\n\"I'll tell ye all particulars.  When I got to Casterbridge Barracks,\nthey said, 'The Eleventh Dragoon-Guards be gone away, and new troops\nhave come.' The Eleventh left last week for Melchester and onwards.\nThe Route came from Government like a thief in the night, as is his\nnature to, and afore the Eleventh knew it almost, they were on the\nmarch.  They passed near here.\"\n\nGabriel had listened with interest.  \"I saw them go,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued William, \"they pranced down the street playing 'The\nGirl I Left Behind Me,' so 'tis said, in glorious notes of triumph.\nEvery looker-on's inside shook with the blows of the great drum to\nhis deepest vitals, and there was not a dry eye throughout the town\namong the public-house people and the nameless women!\"\n\n\"But they're not gone to any war?\"\n\n\"No, ma'am; but they be gone to take the places of them who may,\nwhich is very close connected.  And so I said to myself, Fanny's\nyoung man was one of the regiment, and she's gone after him.  There,\nma'am, that's it in black and white.\"\n\n\"Did you find out his name?\"\n\n\"No; nobody knew it.  I believe he was higher in rank than a\nprivate.\"\n\nGabriel remained musing and said nothing, for he was in doubt.\n\n\"Well, we are not likely to know more to-night, at any rate,\"\nsaid Bathsheba.  \"But one of you had better run across to Farmer\nBoldwood's and tell him that much.\"\n\nShe then rose; but before retiring, addressed a few words to them\nwith a pretty dignity, to which her mourning dress added a soberness\nthat was hardly to be found in the words themselves.\n\n\"Now mind, you have a mistress instead of a master. I don't yet know\nmy powers or my talents in farming; but I shall do my best, and if\nyou serve me well, so shall I serve you.  Don't any unfair ones among\nyou (if there are any such, but I hope not) suppose that because I'm\na woman I don't understand the difference between bad goings-on and\ngood.\"\n\n(All.) \"No'm!\"\n\n(Liddy.) \"Excellent well said.\"\n\n\"I shall be up before you are awake; I shall be afield before you are\nup; and I shall have breakfasted before you are afield.  In short, I\nshall astonish you all.\"\n\n(All.) \"Yes'm!\"\n\n\"And so good-night.\"\n\n(All.) \"Good-night, ma'am.\"\n\nThen this small thesmothete stepped from the table, and surged out of\nthe hall, her black silk dress licking up a few straws and dragging\nthem along with a scratching noise upon the floor.  Liddy, elevating\nher feelings to the occasion from a sense of grandeur, floated\noff behind Bathsheba with a milder dignity not entirely free from\ntravesty, and the door was closed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nOUTSIDE THE BARRACKS--SNOW--A MEETING\n\n\nFor dreariness nothing could surpass a prospect in the outskirts of a\ncertain town and military station, many miles north of Weatherbury,\nat a later hour on this same snowy evening--if that may be called a\nprospect of which the chief constituent was darkness.\n\nIt was a night when sorrow may come to the brightest without causing\nany great sense of incongruity: when, with impressible persons, love\nbecomes solicitousness, hope sinks to misgiving, and faith to hope:\nwhen the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret at\nopportunities for ambition that have been passed by, and anticipation\ndoes not prompt to enterprise.\n\nThe scene was a public path, bordered on the left hand by a river,\nbehind which rose a high wall.  On the right was a tract of land,\npartly meadow and partly moor, reaching, at its remote verge, to a\nwide undulating upland.\n\nThe changes of the seasons are less obtrusive on spots of this\nkind than amid woodland scenery.  Still, to a close observer, they\nare just as perceptible; the difference is that their media of\nmanifestation are less trite and familiar than such well-known ones\nas the bursting of the buds or the fall of the leaf.  Many are not\nso stealthy and gradual as we may be apt to imagine in considering\nthe general torpidity of a moor or waste.  Winter, in coming to the\ncountry hereabout, advanced in well-marked stages, wherein might\nhave been successively observed the retreat of the snakes, the\ntransformation of the ferns, the filling of the pools, a rising of\nfogs, the embrowning by frost, the collapse of the fungi, and an\nobliteration by snow.\n\nThis climax of the series had been reached to-night on the aforesaid\nmoor, and for the first time in the season its irregularities were\nforms without features; suggestive of anything, proclaiming nothing,\nand without more character than that of being the limit of something\nelse--the lowest layer of a firmament of snow.  From this chaotic\nskyful of crowding flakes the mead and moor momentarily received\nadditional clothing, only to appear momentarily more naked thereby.\nThe vast arch of cloud above was strangely low, and formed as it were\nthe roof of a large dark cavern, gradually sinking in upon its floor;\nfor the instinctive thought was that the snow lining the heavens and\nthat encrusting the earth would soon unite into one mass without any\nintervening stratum of air at all.\n\nWe turn our attention to the left-hand characteristics; which were\nflatness in respect of the river, verticality in respect of the wall\nbehind it, and darkness as to both.  These features made up the mass.\nIf anything could be darker than the sky, it was the wall, and if any\nthing could be gloomier than the wall it was the river beneath.  The\nindistinct summit of the facade was notched and pronged by chimneys\nhere and there, and upon its face were faintly signified the oblong\nshapes of windows, though only in the upper part.  Below, down to the\nwater's edge, the flat was unbroken by hole or projection.\n\nAn indescribable succession of dull blows, perplexing in their\nregularity, sent their sound with difficulty through the fluffy\natmosphere.  It was a neighbouring clock striking ten.  The bell was\nin the open air, and being overlaid with several inches of muffling\nsnow, had lost its voice for the time.\n\nAbout this hour the snow abated: ten flakes fell where twenty had\nfallen, then one had the room of ten.  Not long after a form moved\nby the brink of the river.\n\nBy its outline upon the colourless background, a close observer\nmight have seen that it was small.  This was all that was positively\ndiscoverable, though it seemed human.\n\nThe shape went slowly along, but without much exertion, for the snow,\nthough sudden, was not as yet more than two inches deep.  At this\ntime some words were spoken aloud:--\n\n\"One.  Two.  Three.  Four.  Five.\"\n\nBetween each utterance the little shape advanced about half a dozen\nyards.  It was evident now that the windows high in the wall were\nbeing counted.  The word \"Five\" represented the fifth window from the\nend of the wall.\n\nHere the spot stopped, and dwindled smaller.  The figure was\nstooping.  Then a morsel of snow flew across the river towards the\nfifth window.  It smacked against the wall at a point several yards\nfrom its mark.  The throw was the idea of a man conjoined with the\nexecution of a woman.  No man who had ever seen bird, rabbit, or\nsquirrel in his childhood, could possibly have thrown with such utter\nimbecility as was shown here.\n\nAnother attempt, and another; till by degrees the wall must have\nbecome pimpled with the adhering lumps of snow.  At last one fragment\nstruck the fifth window.\n\nThe river would have been seen by day to be of that deep smooth sort\nwhich races middle and sides with the same gliding precision, any\nirregularities of speed being immediately corrected by a small\nwhirlpool.  Nothing was heard in reply to the signal but the gurgle\nand cluck of one of these invisible wheels--together with a few small\nsounds which a sad man would have called moans, and a happy man\nlaughter--caused by the flapping of the waters against trifling\nobjects in other parts of the stream.\n\nThe window was struck again in the same manner.\n\nThen a noise was heard, apparently produced by the opening of the\nwindow.  This was followed by a voice from the same quarter.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\nThe tones were masculine, and not those of surprise.  The high\nwall being that of a barrack, and marriage being looked upon with\ndisfavour in the army, assignations and communications had probably\nbeen made across the river before to-night.\n\n\"Is it Sergeant Troy?\" said the blurred spot in the snow,\ntremulously.\n\nThis person was so much like a mere shade upon the earth, and the\nother speaker so much a part of the building, that one would have\nsaid the wall was holding a conversation with the snow.\n\n\"Yes,\" came suspiciously from the shadow. \"What girl are you?\"\n\n\"Oh, Frank--don't you know me?\" said the spot.  \"Your wife, Fanny\nRobin.\"\n\n\"Fanny!\" said the wall, in utter astonishment.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the girl, with a half-suppressed gasp of emotion.\n\nThere was something in the woman's tone which is not that of the\nwife, and there was a manner in the man which is rarely a husband's.\nThe dialogue went on:\n\n\"How did you come here?\"\n\n\"I asked which was your window.  Forgive me!\"\n\n\"I did not expect you to-night.  Indeed, I did not think you would\ncome at all.  It was a wonder you found me here.  I am orderly\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"You said I was to come.\"\n\n\"Well--I said that you might.\"\n\n\"Yes, I mean that I might.  You are glad to see me, Frank?\"\n\n\"Oh yes--of course.\"\n\n\"Can you--come to me!\"\n\n\"My dear Fan, no!  The bugle has sounded, the barrack gates are\nclosed, and I have no leave.  We are all of us as good as in the\ncounty gaol till to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Then I shan't see you till then!\"  The words were in a faltering\ntone of disappointment.\n\n\"How did you get here from Weatherbury?\"\n\n\"I walked--some part of the way--the rest by the carriers.\"\n\n\"I am surprised.\"\n\n\"Yes--so am I.  And Frank, when will it be?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That you promised.\"\n\n\"I don't quite recollect.\"\n\n\"O you do!  Don't speak like that.  It weighs me to the earth.  It\nmakes me say what ought to be said first by you.\"\n\n\"Never mind--say it.\"\n\n\"O, must I?--it is, when shall we be married, Frank?\"\n\n\"Oh, I see.  Well--you have to get proper clothes.\"\n\n\"I have money.  Will it be by banns or license?\"\n\n\"Banns, I should think.\"\n\n\"And we live in two parishes.\"\n\n\"Do we?  What then?\"\n\n\"My lodgings are in St. Mary's, and this is not.  So they will have\nto be published in both.\"\n\n\"Is that the law?\"\n\n\"Yes.  O Frank--you think me forward, I am afraid!  Don't, dear\nFrank--will you--for I love you so.  And you said lots of times you\nwould marry me, and--and--I--I--I--\"\n\n\"Don't cry, now!  It is foolish.  If I said so, of course I will.\"\n\n\"And shall I put up the banns in my parish, and will you in yours?\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\n\"To-morrow?\"\n\n\"Not to-morrow.  We'll settle in a few days.\"\n\n\"You have the permission of the officers?\"\n\n\"No, not yet.\"\n\n\"O--how is it?  You said you almost had before you left\nCasterbridge.\"\n\n\"The fact is, I forgot to ask.  Your coming like this is so sudden\nand unexpected.\"\n\n\"Yes--yes--it is.  It was wrong of me to worry you.  I'll go away\nnow.  Will you come and see me to-morrow, at Mrs. Twills's, in North\nStreet?  I don't like to come to the Barracks.  There are bad women\nabout, and they think me one.\"\n\n\"Quite, so.  I'll come to you, my dear.  Good-night.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Frank--good-night!\"\n\nAnd the noise was again heard of a window closing.  The little spot\nmoved away.  When she passed the corner a subdued exclamation was\nheard inside the wall.\n\n\"Ho--ho--Sergeant--ho--ho!\" An  expostulation followed, but it was\nindistinct; and it became lost amid a low peal of laughter, which was\nhardly distinguishable from the gurgle of the tiny whirlpools\noutside.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nFARMERS--A RULE--AN EXCEPTION\n\n\nThe first public evidence of Bathsheba's decision to be a farmer in\nher own person and by proxy no more was her appearance the following\nmarket-day in the cornmarket at Casterbridge.\n\nThe low though extensive hall, supported by beams and pillars,\nand latterly dignified by the name of Corn Exchange, was thronged\nwith hot men who talked among each other in twos and threes, the\nspeaker of the minute looking sideways into his auditor's face and\nconcentrating his argument by a contraction of one eyelid during\ndelivery.  The greater number carried in their hands ground-ash\nsaplings, using them partly as walking-sticks and partly for poking\nup pigs, sheep, neighbours with their backs turned, and restful\nthings in general, which seemed to require such treatment in the\ncourse of their peregrinations.  During conversations each subjected\nhis sapling to great varieties of usage--bending it round his back,\nforming an arch of it between his two hands, overweighting it on the\nground till it reached nearly a semicircle; or perhaps it was hastily\ntucked under the arm whilst the sample-bag was pulled forth and a\nhandful of corn poured into the palm, which, after criticism, was\nflung upon the floor, an issue of events perfectly well known to\nhalf-a-dozen acute town-bred fowls which had as usual crept into the\nbuilding unobserved, and waited the fulfilment of their anticipations\nwith a high-stretched neck and oblique eye.\n\nAmong these heavy yeomen a feminine figure glided, the single one of\nher sex that the room contained.  She was prettily and even daintily\ndressed.  She moved between them as a chaise between carts, was heard\nafter them as a romance after sermons, was felt among them like a\nbreeze among furnaces.  It had required a little determination--far\nmore than she had at first imagined--to take up a position here, for\nat her first entry the lumbering dialogues had ceased, nearly every\nface had been turned towards her, and those that were already turned\nrigidly fixed there.\n\nTwo or three only of the farmers were personally known to Bathsheba,\nand to these she had made her way.  But if she was to be the\npractical woman she had intended to show herself, business must\nbe carried on, introductions or none, and she ultimately acquired\nconfidence enough to speak and reply boldly to men merely known to\nher by hearsay.  Bathsheba too had her sample-bags, and by degrees\nadopted the professional pour into the hand--holding up the grains\nin her narrow palm for inspection, in perfect Casterbridge manner.\n\nSomething in the exact arch of her upper unbroken row of teeth, and\nin the keenly pointed corners of her red mouth when, with parted\nlips, she somewhat defiantly turned up her face to argue a point with\na tall man, suggested that there was potentiality enough in that\nlithe slip of humanity for alarming exploits of sex, and daring\nenough to carry them out.  But her eyes had a softness--invariably a\nsoftness--which, had they not been dark, would have seemed mistiness;\nas they were, it lowered an expression that might have been piercing\nto simple clearness.\n\nStrange to say of a woman in full bloom and vigor, she always allowed\nher interlocutors to finish their statements before rejoining with\nhers.  In arguing on prices, she held to her own firmly, as was\nnatural in a dealer, and reduced theirs persistently, as was\ninevitable in a woman.  But there was an elasticity in her firmness\nwhich removed it from obstinacy, as there was a _na\u00c3\u00afvet\u00c3\u00a9_ in her\ncheapening which saved it from meanness.\n\nThose of the farmers with whom she had no dealings (by far the\ngreater part) were continually asking each other, \"Who is she?\"\nThe reply would be--\n\n\"Farmer Everdene's niece; took on Weatherbury Upper Farm; turned away\nthe baily, and swears she'll do everything herself.\"\n\nThe other man would then shake his head.\n\n\"Yes, 'tis a pity she's so headstrong,\" the first would say.  \"But we\nought to be proud of her here--she lightens up the old place.  'Tis\nsuch a shapely maid, however, that she'll soon get picked up.\"\n\nIt would be ungallant to suggest that the novelty of her engagement\nin such an occupation had almost as much to do with the magnetism\nas had the beauty of her face and movements.  However, the interest\nwas general, and this Saturday's _d\u00c3\u00a9but_ in the forum, whatever it\nmay have been to Bathsheba as the buying and selling farmer, was\nunquestionably a triumph to her as the maiden.  Indeed, the sensation\nwas so pronounced that her instinct on two or three occasions was\nmerely to walk as a queen among these gods of the fallow, like a\nlittle sister of a little Jove, and to neglect closing prices\naltogether.\n\nThe numerous evidences of her power to attract were only thrown into\ngreater relief by a marked exception.  Women seem to have eyes in\ntheir ribbons for such matters as these.  Bathsheba, without looking\nwithin a right angle of him, was conscious of a black sheep among the\nflock.\n\nIt perplexed her first.  If there had been a respectable minority on\neither side, the case would have been most natural.  If nobody had\nregarded her, she would have taken the matter indifferently--such\ncases had occurred.  If everybody, this man included, she would have\ntaken it as a matter of course--people had done so before.  But the\nsmallness of the exception made the mystery.\n\nShe soon knew thus much of the recusant's appearance.  He was a\ngentlemanly man, with full and distinctly outlined Roman features,\nthe prominences of which glowed in the sun with a bronze-like\nrichness of tone.  He was erect in attitude, and quiet in demeanour.\nOne characteristic pre-eminently marked him--dignity.\n\nApparently he had some time ago reached that entrance to middle age\nat which a man's aspect naturally ceases to alter for the term of\na dozen years or so; and, artificially, a woman's does likewise.\nThirty-five and fifty were his limits of variation--he might have\nbeen either, or anywhere between the two.\n\nIt may be said that married men of forty are usually ready and\ngenerous enough to fling passing glances at any specimen of moderate\nbeauty they may discern by the way.  Probably, as with persons\nplaying whist for love, the consciousness of a certain immunity under\nany circumstances from that worst possible ultimate, the having to\npay, makes them unduly speculative.  Bathsheba was convinced that\nthis unmoved person was not a married man.\n\nWhen marketing was over, she rushed off to Liddy, who was waiting\nfor her beside the yellow gig in which they had driven to town.\nThe horse was put in, and on they trotted--Bathsheba's sugar, tea,\nand drapery parcels being packed behind, and expressing in some\nindescribable manner, by their colour, shape, and general lineaments,\nthat they were that young lady-farmer's property, and the grocer's\nand draper's no more.\n\n\"I've been through it, Liddy, and it is over.  I shan't mind it\nagain, for they will all have grown accustomed to seeing me there;\nbut this morning it was as bad as being married--eyes everywhere!\"\n\n\"I knowed it would be,\" Liddy said.  \"Men be such a terrible class of\nsociety to look at a body.\"\n\n\"But there was one man who had more sense than to waste his time upon\nme.\"  The information was put in this form that Liddy might not for a\nmoment suppose her mistress was at all piqued.  \"A very good-looking\nman,\" she continued, \"upright; about forty, I should think.  Do you\nknow at all who he could be?\"\n\nLiddy couldn't think.\n\n\"Can't you guess at all?\" said Bathsheba with some disappointment.\n\n\"I haven't a notion; besides, 'tis no difference, since he took less\nnotice of you than any of the rest.  Now, if he'd taken more, it\nwould have mattered a great deal.\"\n\nBathsheba was suffering from the reverse feeling just then, and they\nbowled along in silence.  A low carriage, bowling along still more\nrapidly behind a horse of unimpeachable breed, overtook and passed\nthem.\n\n\"Why, there he is!\" she said.\n\nLiddy looked.  \"That!  That's Farmer Boldwood--of course 'tis--the\nman you couldn't see the other day when he called.\"\n\n\"Oh, Farmer Boldwood,\" murmured Bathsheba, and looked at him as he\noutstripped them.  The farmer had never turned his head once, but\nwith eyes fixed on the most advanced point along the road, passed as\nunconsciously and abstractedly as if Bathsheba and her charms were\nthin air.\n\n\"He's an interesting man--don't you think so?\" she remarked.\n\n\"O yes, very.  Everybody owns it,\" replied Liddy.\n\n\"I wonder why he is so wrapt up and indifferent, and seemingly so far\naway from all he sees around him.\"\n\n\"It is said--but not known for certain--that he met with some bitter\ndisappointment when he was a young man and merry.  A woman jilted\nhim, they say.\"\n\n\"People always say that--and we know very well women scarcely ever\njilt men; 'tis the men who jilt us.  I expect it is simply his nature\nto be so reserved.\"\n\n\"Simply his nature--I expect so, miss--nothing else in the world.\"\n\n\"Still, 'tis more romantic to think he has been served cruelly, poor\nthing'!  Perhaps, after all, he has!\"\n\n\"Depend upon it he has.  Oh yes, miss, he has!  I feel he must have.\"\n\n\"However, we are very apt to think extremes of people.  I shouldn't\nwonder after all if it wasn't a little of both--just between the\ntwo--rather cruelly used and rather reserved.\"\n\n\"Oh dear no, miss--I can't think it between the two!\"\n\n\"That's most likely.\"\n\n\"Well, yes, so it is.  I am convinced it is most likely. You may take\nmy word, miss, that that's what's the matter with him.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nSORTES SANCTORUM--THE VALENTINE\n\n\nIt was Sunday afternoon in the farmhouse, on the thirteenth of\nFebruary.  Dinner being over, Bathsheba, for want of a better\ncompanion, had asked Liddy to come and sit with her.  The mouldy pile\nwas dreary in winter-time before the candles were lighted and the\nshutters closed; the atmosphere of the place seemed as old as the\nwalls; every nook behind the furniture had a temperature of its own,\nfor the fire was not kindled in this part of the house early in the\nday; and Bathsheba's new piano, which was an old one in other annals,\nlooked particularly sloping and out of level on the warped floor\nbefore night threw a shade over its less prominent angles and hid\nthe unpleasantness.  Liddy, like a little brook, though shallow, was\nalways rippling; her presence had not so much weight as to task\nthought, and yet enough to exercise it.\n\nOn the table lay an old quarto Bible, bound in leather.  Liddy\nlooking at it said,--\n\n\"Did you ever find out, miss, who you are going to marry by means of\nthe Bible and key?\"\n\n\"Don't be so foolish, Liddy.  As if such things could be.\"\n\n\"Well, there's a good deal in it, all the same.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, child.\"\n\n\"And it makes your heart beat fearful.  Some believe in it; some\ndon't; I do.\"\n\n\"Very well, let's try it,\" said Bathsheba, bounding from her seat\nwith that total disregard of consistency which can be indulged in\ntowards a dependent, and entering into the spirit of divination at\nonce.  \"Go and get the front door key.\"\n\nLiddy fetched it.  \"I wish it wasn't Sunday,\" she said, on returning.\n\"Perhaps 'tis wrong.\"\n\n\"What's right week days is right Sundays,\" replied her mistress in a\ntone which was a proof in itself.\n\nThe book was opened--the leaves, drab with age, being quite worn away\nat much-read verses by the forefingers of unpractised readers in\nformer days, where they were moved along under the line as an aid to\nthe vision.  The special verse in the Book of Ruth was sought out by\nBathsheba, and the sublime words met her eye.  They slightly thrilled\nand abashed her.  It was Wisdom in the abstract facing Folly in the\nconcrete.  Folly in the concrete blushed, persisted in her intention,\nand placed the key on the book.  A rusty patch immediately upon the\nverse, caused by previous pressure of an iron substance thereon, told\nthat this was not the first time the old volume had been used for the\npurpose.\n\n\"Now keep steady, and be silent,\" said Bathsheba.\n\nThe verse was repeated; the book turned round; Bathsheba blushed\nguiltily.\n\n\"Who did you try?\" said Liddy curiously.\n\n\"I shall not tell you.\"\n\n\"Did you notice Mr. Boldwood's doings in church this morning, miss?\"\nLiddy continued, adumbrating by the remark the track her thoughts had\ntaken.\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said Bathsheba, with serene indifference.\n\n\"His pew is exactly opposite yours, miss.\"\n\n\"I know it.\"\n\n\"And you did not see his goings on!\"\n\n\"Certainly I did not, I tell you.\"\n\nLiddy assumed a smaller physiognomy, and shut her lips decisively.\n\nThis move was unexpected, and proportionately disconcerting.  \"What\ndid he do?\" Bathsheba said perforce.\n\n\"Didn't turn his head to look at you once all the service.\"\n\n\"Why should he?\" again demanded her mistress, wearing a nettled look.\n\"I didn't ask him to.\"\n\n\"Oh no.  But everybody else was noticing you; and it was odd he\ndidn't.  There, 'tis like him.  Rich and gentlemanly, what does he\ncare?\"\n\nBathsheba dropped into a silence intended to express that she had\nopinions on the matter too abstruse for Liddy's comprehension, rather\nthan that she had nothing to say.\n\n\"Dear me--I had nearly forgotten the valentine I bought yesterday,\"\nshe exclaimed at length.\n\n\"Valentine! who for, miss?\" said Liddy.  \"Farmer Boldwood?\"\n\nIt was the single name among all possible wrong ones that just at\nthis moment seemed to Bathsheba more pertinent than the right.\n\n\"Well, no.  It is only for little Teddy Coggan.  I have promised him\nsomething, and this will be a pretty surprise for him.  Liddy, you\nmay as well bring me my desk and I'll direct it at once.\"\n\nBathsheba took from her desk a gorgeously illuminated and embossed\ndesign in post-octavo, which had been bought on the previous\nmarket-day at the chief stationer's in Casterbridge.  In the centre\nwas a small oval enclosure; this was left blank, that the sender\nmight insert tender words more appropriate to the special occasion\nthan any generalities by a printer could possibly be.\n\n\"Here's a place for writing,\" said Bathsheba.  \"What shall I put?\"\n\n\"Something of this sort, I should think,\" returned Liddy promptly:--\n\n\n   \"The rose is red,\n   The violet blue,\n   Carnation's sweet,\n   And so are you.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, that shall be it.  It just suits itself to a chubby-faced child\nlike him,\" said Bathsheba.  She inserted the words in a small though\nlegible handwriting; enclosed the sheet in an envelope, and dipped\nher pen for the direction.\n\n\"What fun it would be to send it to the stupid old Boldwood, and how\nhe would wonder!\" said the irrepressible Liddy, lifting her eyebrows,\nand indulging in an awful mirth on the verge of fear as she thought\nof the moral and social magnitude of the man contemplated.\n\nBathsheba paused to regard the idea at full length.  Boldwood's had\nbegun to be a troublesome image--a species of Daniel in her kingdom\nwho persisted in kneeling eastward when reason and common sense said\nthat he might just as well follow suit with the rest, and afford her\nthe official glance of admiration which cost nothing at all.  She was\nfar from being seriously concerned about his nonconformity.  Still,\nit was faintly depressing that the most dignified and valuable man\nin the parish should withhold his eyes, and that a girl like Liddy\nshould talk about it.  So Liddy's idea was at first rather harassing\nthan piquant.\n\n\"No, I won't do that.  He wouldn't see any humour in it.\"\n\n\"He'd worry to death,\" said the persistent Liddy.\n\n\"Really, I don't care particularly to send it to Teddy,\" remarked her\nmistress.  \"He's rather a naughty child sometimes.\"\n\n\"Yes--that he is.\"\n\n\"Let's toss as men do,\" said Bathsheba, idly.  \"Now then, head,\nBoldwood; tail, Teddy.  No, we won't toss money on a Sunday, that\nwould be tempting the devil indeed.\"\n\n\"Toss this hymn-book; there can't be no sinfulness in that, miss.\"\n\n\"Very well.  Open, Boldwood--shut, Teddy.  No; it's more likely to\nfall open.  Open, Teddy--shut, Boldwood.\"\n\nThe book went fluttering in the air and came down shut.\n\nBathsheba, a small yawn upon her mouth, took the pen, and with\noff-hand serenity directed the missive to Boldwood.\n\n\"Now light a candle, Liddy.  Which seal shall we use? Here's a\nunicorn's head--there's nothing in that.  What's this?--two\ndoves--no.  It ought to be something extraordinary, ought it not,\nLiddy? Here's one with a motto--I remember it is some funny one, but\nI can't read it. We'll try this, and if it doesn't do we'll have\nanother.\"\n\nA large red seal was duly affixed.  Bathsheba looked closely at the\nhot wax to discover the words.\n\n\"Capital!\" she exclaimed, throwing down the letter frolicsomely.\n\"'Twould upset the solemnity of a parson and clerke too.\"\n\nLiddy looked at the words of the seal, and read--\n\n\n   \"MARRY ME.\"\n\n\nThe same evening the letter was sent, and was duly sorted in\nCasterbridge post-office that night, to be returned to Weatherbury\nagain in the morning.\n\nSo very idly and unreflectingly was this deed done.  Of love as a\nspectacle Bathsheba had a fair knowledge; but of love subjectively\nshe knew nothing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nEFFECT OF THE LETTER--SUNRISE\n\n\nAt dusk, on the evening of St. Valentine's Day, Boldwood sat down\nto supper as usual, by a beaming fire of aged logs.  Upon the\nmantel-shelf before him was a time-piece, surmounted by a spread\neagle, and upon the eagle's wings was the letter Bathsheba had sent.\nHere the bachelor's gaze was continually fastening itself, till the\nlarge red seal became as a blot of blood on the retina of his eye;\nand as he ate and drank he still read in fancy the words thereon,\nalthough they were too remote for his sight--\n\n\n   \"MARRY ME.\"\n\n\nThe pert injunction was like those crystal substances which,\ncolourless themselves, assume the tone of objects about them.  Here,\nin the quiet of Boldwood's parlour, where everything that was not\ngrave was extraneous, and where the atmosphere was that of a Puritan\nSunday lasting all the week, the letter and its dictum changed their\ntenor from the thoughtlessness of their origin to a deep solemnity,\nimbibed from their accessories now.\n\nSince the receipt of the missive in the morning, Boldwood had felt\nthe symmetry of his existence to be slowly getting distorted in the\ndirection of an ideal passion.  The disturbance was as the first\nfloating weed to Columbus--the contemptibly little suggesting\npossibilities of the infinitely great.\n\nThe letter must have had an origin and a motive.  That the latter\nwas of the smallest magnitude compatible with its existence at all,\nBoldwood, of course, did not know.  And such an explanation did not\nstrike him as a possibility even.  It is foreign to a mystified\ncondition of mind to realize of the mystifier that the processes of\napproving a course suggested by circumstance, and of striking out a\ncourse from inner impulse, would look the same in the result.  The\nvast difference between starting a train of events, and directing\ninto a particular groove a series already started, is rarely apparent\nto the person confounded by the issue.\n\nWhen Boldwood went to bed he placed the valentine in the corner of\nthe looking-glass.  He was conscious of its presence, even when his\nback was turned upon it.  It was the first time in Boldwood's life\nthat such an event had occurred.  The same fascination that caused\nhim to think it an act which had a deliberate motive prevented\nhim from regarding it as an impertinence.  He looked again at\nthe direction.  The mysterious influences of night invested the\nwriting with the presence of the unknown writer.  Somebody's--some\nWOMAN'S--hand had travelled softly over the paper bearing his name;\nher unrevealed eyes had watched every curve as she formed it; her\nbrain had seen him in imagination the while.  Why should she have\nimagined him?  Her mouth--were the lips red or pale, plump or\ncreased?--had curved itself to a certain expression as the pen went\non--the corners had moved with all their natural tremulousness: what\nhad been the expression?\n\nThe vision of the woman writing, as a supplement to the words\nwritten, had no individuality.  She was a misty shape, and well she\nmight be, considering that her original was at that moment sound\nasleep and oblivious of all love and letter-writing under the sky.\nWhenever Boldwood dozed she took a form, and comparatively ceased to\nbe a vision: when he awoke there was the letter justifying the dream.\n\nThe moon shone to-night, and its light was not of a customary kind.\nHis window admitted only a reflection of its rays, and the pale sheen\nhad that reversed direction which snow gives, coming upward and\nlighting up his ceiling in an unnatural way, casting shadows in\nstrange places, and putting lights where shadows had used to be.\n\nThe substance of the epistle had occupied him but little in\ncomparison with the fact of its arrival.  He suddenly wondered\nif anything more might be found in the envelope than what he had\nwithdrawn.  He jumped out of bed in the weird light, took the\nletter, pulled out the flimsy sheet, shook the envelope--searched it.\nNothing more was there.  Boldwood looked, as he had a hundred times\nthe preceding day, at the insistent red seal: \"Marry me,\" he said\naloud.\n\nThe solemn and reserved yeoman again closed the letter, and stuck\nit in the frame of the glass.  In doing so he caught sight of his\nreflected features, wan in expression, and insubstantial in form.\nHe saw how closely compressed was his mouth, and that his eyes were\nwide-spread and vacant.  Feeling uneasy and dissatisfied with himself\nfor this nervous excitability, he returned to bed.\n\nThen the dawn drew on.  The full power of the clear heaven was not\nequal to that of a cloudy sky at noon, when Boldwood arose and\ndressed himself.  He descended the stairs and went out towards the\ngate of a field to the east, leaning over which he paused and looked\naround.\n\nIt was one of the usual slow sunrises of this time of the year, and\nthe sky, pure violet in the zenith, was leaden to the northward,\nand murky to the east, where, over the snowy down or ewe-lease on\nWeatherbury Upper Farm, and apparently resting upon the ridge, the\nonly half of the sun yet visible burnt rayless, like a red and\nflameless fire shining over a white hearthstone.  The whole effect\nresembled a sunset as childhood resembles age.\n\nIn other directions, the fields and sky were so much of one colour by\nthe snow, that it was difficult in a hasty glance to tell whereabouts\nthe horizon occurred; and in general there was here, too, that\nbefore-mentioned preternatural inversion of light and shade which\nattends the prospect when the garish brightness commonly in the sky\nis found on the earth, and the shades of earth are in the sky.  Over\nthe west hung the wasting moon, now dull and greenish-yellow, like\ntarnished brass.\n\nBoldwood was listlessly noting how the frost had hardened and glazed\nthe surface of the snow, till it shone in the red eastern light with\nthe polish of marble; how, in some portions of the slope, withered\ngrass-bents, encased in icicles, bristled through the smooth wan\ncoverlet in the twisted and curved shapes of old Venetian glass; and\nhow the footprints of a few birds, which had hopped over the snow\nwhilst it lay in the state of a soft fleece, were now frozen to a\nshort permanency.  A half-muffled noise of light wheels interrupted\nhim.  Boldwood turned back into the road.  It was the mail-cart--a\ncrazy, two-wheeled vehicle, hardly heavy enough to resist a puff of\nwind.  The driver held out a letter.  Boldwood seized it and opened\nit, expecting another anonymous one--so greatly are people's ideas of\nprobability a mere sense that precedent will repeat itself.\n\n\"I don't think it is for you, sir,\" said the man, when he saw\nBoldwood's action.  \"Though there is no name, I think it is for your\nshepherd.\"\n\nBoldwood looked then at the address--\n\n\n   To the New Shepherd,\n         Weatherbury Farm,\n               Near Casterbridge\n\n\n\"Oh--what a mistake!--it is not mine.  Nor is it for my shepherd.  It\nis for Miss Everdene's.  You had better take it on to him--Gabriel\nOak--and say I opened it in mistake.\"\n\nAt this moment, on the ridge, up against the blazing sky, a figure\nwas visible, like the black snuff in the midst of a candle-flame.\nThen it moved and began to bustle about vigorously from place to\nplace, carrying square skeleton masses, which were riddled by the\nsame rays.  A small figure on all fours followed behind.  The tall\nform was that of Gabriel Oak; the small one that of George; the\narticles in course of transit were hurdles.\n\n\"Wait,\" said Boldwood. \"That's the man on the hill.  I'll take the\nletter to him myself.\"\n\nTo Boldwood it was now no longer merely a letter to another man.  It\nwas an opportunity.  Exhibiting a face pregnant with intention, he\nentered the snowy field.\n\nGabriel, at that minute, descended the hill towards the right.  The\nglow stretched down in this direction now, and touched the distant\nroof of Warren's Malthouse--whither the shepherd was apparently bent:\nBoldwood followed at a distance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nA MORNING MEETING--THE LETTER AGAIN\n\n\nThe scarlet and orange light outside the malthouse did not penetrate\nto its interior, which was, as usual, lighted by a rival glow of\nsimilar hue, radiating from the hearth.\n\nThe maltster, after having lain down in his clothes for a few\nhours, was now sitting beside a three-legged table, breakfasting of\nbread and bacon.  This was eaten on the plateless system, which is\nperformed by placing a slice of bread upon the table, the meat flat\nupon the bread, a mustard plaster upon the meat, and a pinch of salt\nupon the whole, then cutting them vertically downwards with a large\npocket-knife till wood is reached, when the severed lump is impaled\non the knife, elevated, and sent the proper way of food.\n\nThe maltster's lack of teeth appeared not to sensibly diminish\nhis powers as a mill.  He had been without them for so many years\nthat toothlessness was felt less to be a defect than hard gums an\nacquisition.  Indeed, he seemed to approach the grave as a hyperbolic\ncurve approaches a straight line--less directly as he got nearer,\ntill it was doubtful if he would ever reach it at all.\n\nIn the ashpit was a heap of potatoes roasting, and a boiling pipkin\nof charred bread, called \"coffee\", for the benefit of whomsoever\nshould call, for Warren's was a sort of clubhouse, used as an\nalternative to the inn.\n\n\"I say, says I, we get a fine day, and then down comes a snapper at\nnight,\" was a remark now suddenly heard spreading into the malthouse\nfrom the door, which had been opened the previous moment.  The form\nof Henery Fray advanced to the fire, stamping the snow from his boots\nwhen about half-way there.  The speech and entry had not seemed to be\nat all an abrupt beginning to the maltster, introductory matter being\noften omitted in this neighbourhood, both from word and deed, and\nthe maltster having the same latitude allowed him, did not hurry to\nreply.  He picked up a fragment of cheese, by pecking upon it with\nhis knife, as a butcher picks up skewers.\n\nHenery appeared in a drab kerseymere great-coat, buttoned over his\nsmock-frock, the white skirts of the latter being visible to the\ndistance of about a foot below the coat-tails, which, when you\ngot used to the style of dress, looked natural enough, and even\nornamental--it certainly was comfortable.\n\nMatthew Moon, Joseph Poorgrass, and other carters and waggoners\nfollowed at his heels, with great lanterns dangling from their hands,\nwhich showed that they had just come from the cart-horse stables,\nwhere they had been busily engaged since four o'clock that morning.\n\n\"And how is she getting on without a baily?\" the maltster inquired.\nHenery shook his head, and smiled one of the bitter smiles, dragging\nall the flesh of his forehead into a corrugated heap in the centre.\n\n\"She'll rue it--surely, surely!\" he said.  \"Benjy Pennyways were not\na true man or an honest baily--as big a betrayer as Judas Iscariot\nhimself.  But to think she can carr' on alone!\" He allowed his head\nto swing laterally three or four times in silence.  \"Never in all my\ncreeping up--never!\"\n\nThis was recognized by all as the conclusion of some gloomy speech\nwhich had been expressed in thought alone during the shake of the\nhead; Henery meanwhile retained several marks of despair upon his\nface, to imply that they would be required for use again directly\nhe should go on speaking.\n\n\"All will be ruined, and ourselves too, or there's no meat in\ngentlemen's houses!\" said Mark Clark.\n\n\"A headstrong maid, that's what she is--and won't listen to no advice\nat all.  Pride and vanity have ruined many a cobbler's dog.  Dear,\ndear, when I think o' it, I sorrows like a man in travel!\"\n\n\"True, Henery, you do, I've heard ye,\" said Joseph Poorgrass in a\nvoice of thorough attestation, and with a wire-drawn smile of misery.\n\n\"'Twould do a martel man no harm to have what's under her bonnet,\"\nsaid Billy Smallbury, who had just entered, bearing his one tooth\nbefore him.  \"She can spaik real language, and must have some sense\nsomewhere.  Do ye foller me?\"\n\n\"I do, I do; but no baily--I deserved that place,\" wailed Henery,\nsignifying wasted genius by gazing blankly at visions of a high\ndestiny apparently visible to him on Billy Smallbury's smock-frock.\n\"There, 'twas to be, I suppose.  Your lot is your lot, and Scripture\nis nothing; for if you do good you don't get rewarded according to\nyour works, but be cheated in some mean way out of your recompense.\"\n\n\"No, no; I don't agree with'ee there,\" said Mark Clark.  \"God's a\nperfect gentleman in that respect.\"\n\n\"Good works good pay, so to speak it,\" attested Joseph Poorgrass.\n\nA short pause ensued, and as a sort of _entr'acte_ Henery turned and\nblew out the lanterns, which the increase of daylight rendered no\nlonger necessary even in the malthouse, with its one pane of glass.\n\n\"I wonder what a farmer-woman can want with a harpsichord, dulcimer,\npianner, or whatever 'tis they d'call it?\" said the maltster.  \"Liddy\nsaith she've a new one.\"\n\n\"Got a pianner?\"\n\n\"Ay.  Seems her old uncle's things were not good enough for her.\nShe've bought all but everything new.  There's heavy chairs for the\nstout, weak and wiry ones for the slender; great watches, getting on\nto the size of clocks, to stand upon the chimbley-piece.\"\n\n\"Pictures, for the most part wonderful frames.\"\n\n\"And long horse-hair settles for the drunk, with horse-hair pillows\nat each end,\" said Mr. Clark.  \"Likewise looking-glasses for the\npretty, and lying books for the wicked.\"\n\nA firm loud tread was now heard stamping outside; the door was opened\nabout six inches, and somebody on the other side exclaimed--\n\n\"Neighbours, have ye got room for a few new-born lambs?\"\n\n\"Ay, sure, shepherd,\" said the conclave.\n\nThe door was flung back till it kicked the wall and trembled from\ntop to bottom with the blow.  Mr. Oak appeared in the entry with a\nsteaming face, hay-bands wound about his ankles to keep out the snow,\na leather strap round his waist outside the smock-frock, and looking\naltogether an epitome of the world's health and vigour.  Four lambs\nhung in various embarrassing attitudes over his shoulders, and the\ndog George, whom Gabriel had contrived to fetch from Norcombe,\nstalked solemnly behind.\n\n\"Well, Shepherd Oak, and how's lambing this year, if I mid say it?\"\ninquired Joseph Poorgrass.\n\n\"Terrible trying,\" said Oak.  \"I've been wet through twice a-day,\neither in snow or rain, this last fortnight.  Cainy and I haven't\ntined our eyes to-night.\"\n\n\"A good few twins, too, I hear?\"\n\n\"Too many by half.  Yes; 'tis a very queer lambing this year.  We\nshan't have done by Lady Day.\"\n\n\"And last year 'twer all over by Sexajessamine Sunday,\" Joseph\nremarked.\n\n\"Bring on the rest Cain,\" said Gabriel, \"and then run back to the\newes.  I'll follow you soon.\"\n\nCainy Ball--a cheery-faced young lad, with a small circular orifice\nby way of mouth, advanced and deposited two others, and retired as he\nwas bidden.  Oak lowered the lambs from their unnatural elevation,\nwrapped them in hay, and placed them round the fire.\n\n\"We've no lambing-hut here, as I used to have at Norcombe,\" said\nGabriel, \"and 'tis such a plague to bring the weakly ones to a house.\nIf 'twasn't for your place here, malter, I don't know what I should\ndo i' this keen weather.  And how is it with you to-day, malter?\"\n\n\"Oh, neither sick nor sorry, shepherd; but no younger.\"\n\n\"Ay--I understand.\"\n\n\"Sit down, Shepherd Oak,\" continued the ancient man of malt.  \"And\nhow was the old place at Norcombe, when ye went for your dog?  I\nshould like to see the old familiar spot; but faith, I shouldn't know\na soul there now.\"\n\n\"I suppose you wouldn't.  'Tis altered very much.\"\n\n\"Is it true that Dicky Hill's wooden cider-house is pulled down?\"\n\n\"Oh yes--years ago, and Dicky's cottage just above it.\"\n\n\"Well, to be sure!\"\n\n\"Yes; and Tompkins's old apple-tree is rooted that used to bear two\nhogsheads of cider; and no help from other trees.\"\n\n\"Rooted?--you don't say it!  Ah! stirring times we live in--stirring\ntimes.\"\n\n\"And you can mind the old well that used to be in the middle of the\nplace?  That's turned into a solid iron pump with a large stone\ntrough, and all complete.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear--how the face of nations alter, and what we live to see\nnowadays!  Yes--and 'tis the same here.  They've been talking but now\nof the mis'ess's strange doings.\"\n\n\"What have you been saying about her?\" inquired Oak, sharply turning\nto the rest, and getting very warm.\n\n\"These middle-aged men have been pulling her over the coals for pride\nand vanity,\" said Mark Clark; \"but I say, let her have rope enough.\nBless her pretty face--shouldn't I like to do so--upon her cherry\nlips!\" The gallant Mark Clark here made a peculiar and well known\nsound with his own.\n\n\"Mark,\" said Gabriel, sternly, \"now you mind this! none of that\ndalliance-talk--that smack-and-coddle style of yours--about Miss\nEverdene.  I don't allow it.  Do you hear?\"\n\n\"With all my heart, as I've got no chance,\" replied Mr. Clark,\ncordially.\n\n\"I suppose you've been speaking against her?\" said Oak, turning to\nJoseph Poorgrass with a very grim look.\n\n\"No, no--not a word I--'tis a real joyful thing that she's no worse,\nthat's what I say,\" said Joseph, trembling and blushing with terror.\n\"Matthew just said--\"\n\n\"Matthew Moon, what have you been saying?\" asked Oak.\n\n\"I?  Why ye know I wouldn't harm a worm--no, not one underground\nworm?\" said Matthew Moon, looking very uneasy.\n\n\"Well, somebody has--and look here, neighbours,\" Gabriel, though one\nof the quietest and most gentle men on earth, rose to the occasion,\nwith martial promptness and vigour.  \"That's my fist.\"  Here he\nplaced his fist, rather smaller in size than a common loaf, in the\nmathematical centre of the maltster's little table, and with it gave\na bump or two thereon, as if to ensure that their eyes all thoroughly\ntook in the idea of fistiness before he went further.  \"Now--the\nfirst man in the parish that I hear prophesying bad of our mistress,\nwhy\" (here the fist was raised and let fall as Thor might have done\nwith his hammer in assaying it)--\"he'll smell and taste that--or I'm\na Dutchman.\"\n\nAll earnestly expressed by their features that their minds did not\nwander to Holland for a moment on account of this statement, but were\ndeploring the difference which gave rise to the figure; and Mark\nClark cried \"Hear, hear; just what I should ha' said.\" The dog George\nlooked up at the same time after the shepherd's menace, and though he\nunderstood English but imperfectly, began to growl.\n\n\"Now, don't ye take on so, shepherd, and sit down!\" said Henery,\nwith a deprecating peacefulness equal to anything of the kind in\nChristianity.\n\n\"We hear that ye be a extraordinary good and clever man, shepherd,\"\nsaid Joseph Poorgrass with considerable anxiety from behind the\nmaltster's bedstead, whither he had retired for safety.  \"'Tis a\ngreat thing to be clever, I'm sure,\" he added, making movements\nassociated with states of mind rather than body; \"we wish we were,\ndon't we, neighbours?\"\n\n\"Ay, that we do, sure,\" said Matthew Moon, with a small anxious laugh\ntowards Oak, to show how very friendly disposed he was likewise.\n\n\"Who's been telling you I'm clever?\" said Oak.\n\n\"'Tis blowed about from pillar to post quite common,\" said Matthew.\n\"We hear that ye can tell the time as well by the stars as we can by\nthe sun and moon, shepherd.\"\n\n\"Yes, I can do a little that way,\" said Gabriel, as a man of medium\nsentiments on the subject.\n\n\"And that ye can make sun-dials, and prent folks' names upon their\nwaggons almost like copper-plate, with beautiful flourishes, and\ngreat long tails.  A excellent fine thing for ye to be such a clever\nman, shepherd.  Joseph Poorgrass used to prent to Farmer James\nEverdene's waggons before you came, and 'a could never mind which way\nto turn the J's and E's--could ye, Joseph?\" Joseph shook his head\nto express how absolute was the fact that he couldn't.  \"And so you\nused to do 'em the wrong way, like this, didn't ye, Joseph?\" Matthew\nmarked on the dusty floor with his whip-handle\n\n\n   [the word J A M E S appears here with the \"J\" and the \"E\"\n   printed backwards]\n\n\n\"And how Farmer James would cuss, and call thee a fool, wouldn't he,\nJoseph, when 'a seed his name looking so inside-out-like?\" continued\nMatthew Moon with feeling.\n\n\"Ay--'a would,\" said Joseph, meekly.  \"But, you see, I wasn't so much\nto blame, for them J's and E's be such trying sons o' witches for the\nmemory to mind whether they face backward or forward; and I always\nhad such a forgetful memory, too.\"\n\n\"'Tis a very bad affliction for ye, being such a man of calamities in\nother ways.\"\n\n\"Well, 'tis; but a happy Providence ordered that it should be no\nworse, and I feel my thanks.  As to shepherd, there, I'm sure mis'ess\nought to have made ye her baily--such a fitting man for't as you be.\"\n\n\"I don't mind owning that I expected it,\" said Oak, frankly.\n\"Indeed, I hoped for the place.  At the same time, Miss Everdene has\na right to be her own baily if she choose--and to keep me down to be\na common shepherd only.\"  Oak drew a slow breath, looked sadly into\nthe bright ashpit, and seemed lost in thoughts not of the most\nhopeful hue.\n\nThe genial warmth of the fire now began to stimulate the nearly\nlifeless lambs to bleat and move their limbs briskly upon the hay,\nand to recognize for the first time the fact that they were born.\nTheir noise increased to a chorus of baas, upon which Oak pulled the\nmilk-can from before the fire, and taking a small tea-pot from the\npocket of his smock-frock, filled it with milk, and taught those of\nthe helpless creatures which were not to be restored to their dams\nhow to drink from the spout--a trick they acquired with astonishing\naptitude.\n\n\"And she don't even let ye have the skins of the dead lambs, I hear?\"\nresumed Joseph Poorgrass, his eyes lingering on the operations of Oak\nwith the necessary melancholy.\n\n\"I don't have them,\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"Ye be very badly used, shepherd,\" hazarded Joseph again, in the hope\nof getting Oak as an ally in lamentation after all.  \"I think she's\ntook against ye--that I do.\"\n\n\"Oh no--not at all,\" replied Gabriel, hastily, and a sigh escaped\nhim, which the deprivation of lamb skins could hardly have caused.\n\nBefore any further remark had been added a shade darkened the door,\nand Boldwood entered the malthouse, bestowing upon each a nod of a\nquality between friendliness and condescension.\n\n\"Ah! Oak, I thought you were here,\" he said.  \"I met the mail-cart\nten minutes ago, and a letter was put into my hand, which I opened\nwithout reading the address.  I believe it is yours.  You must excuse\nthe accident please.\"\n\n\"Oh yes--not a bit of difference, Mr. Boldwood--not a bit,\" said\nGabriel, readily.  He had not a correspondent on earth, nor was there\na possible letter coming to him whose contents the whole parish would\nnot have been welcome to peruse.\n\nOak stepped aside, and read the following in an unknown hand:--\n\n\n   DEAR FRIEND,--I do not know your name, but I think these\n   few lines will reach you, which I wrote to thank you for\n   your kindness to me the night I left Weatherbury in a\n   reckless way.  I also return the money I owe you, which you\n   will excuse my not keeping as a gift.  All has ended well,\n   and I am happy to say I am going to be married to the young\n   man who has courted me for some time--Sergeant Troy, of\n   the 11th Dragoon Guards, now quartered in this town.  He\n   would, I know, object to my having received anything except\n   as a loan, being a man of great respectability and high\n   honour--indeed, a nobleman by blood.\n\n   I should be much obliged to you if you would keep the\n   contents of this letter a secret for the present, dear\n   friend.  We mean to surprise Weatherbury by coming there\n   soon as husband and wife, though I blush to state it to one\n   nearly a stranger.  The sergeant grew up in Weatherbury.\n   Thanking you again for your kindness,\n\n            I am, your sincere well-wisher,\n                     FANNY ROBIN.\n\n\n\"Have you read it, Mr. Boldwood?\" said Gabriel; \"if not, you had\nbetter do so.  I know you are interested in Fanny Robin.\"\n\nBoldwood read the letter and looked grieved.\n\n\"Fanny--poor Fanny! the end she is so confident of has not yet\ncome, she should remember--and may never come.  I see she gives no\naddress.\"\n\n\"What sort of a man is this Sergeant Troy?\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"H'm--I'm afraid not one to build much hope upon in such a case as\nthis,\" the farmer murmured, \"though he's a clever fellow, and up to\neverything.  A slight romance attaches to him, too.  His mother was\na French governess, and it seems that a secret attachment existed\nbetween her and the late Lord Severn.  She was married to a poor\nmedical man, and soon after an infant was born; and while money was\nforthcoming all went on well.  Unfortunately for her boy, his best\nfriends died; and he got then a situation as second clerk at a\nlawyer's in Casterbridge.  He stayed there for some time, and might\nhave worked himself into a dignified position of some sort had he not\nindulged in the wild freak of enlisting.  I have much doubt if ever\nlittle Fanny will surprise us in the way she mentions--very much\ndoubt. A silly girl!--silly girl!\"\n\nThe door was hurriedly burst open again, and in came running Cainy\nBall out of breath, his mouth red and open, like the bell of a penny\ntrumpet, from which he coughed with noisy vigour and great distension\nof face.\n\n\"Now, Cain Ball,\" said Oak, sternly, \"why will you run so fast and\nlose your breath so?  I'm always telling you of it.\"\n\n\"Oh--I--a puff of mee breath--went--the--wrong way, please, Mister\nOak, and made me cough--hok--hok!\"\n\n\"Well--what have you come for?\"\n\n\"I've run to tell ye,\" said the junior shepherd, supporting his\nexhausted youthful frame against the doorpost, \"that you must come\ndirectly.  Two more ewes have twinned--that's what's the matter,\nShepherd Oak.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's it,\" said Oak, jumping up, and dimissing for the present\nhis thoughts on poor Fanny.  \"You are a good boy to run and tell me,\nCain, and you shall smell a large plum pudding some day as a treat.\nBut, before we go, Cainy, bring the tarpot, and we'll mark this lot\nand have done with 'em.\"\n\nOak took from his illimitable pockets a marking iron, dipped it\ninto the pot, and imprinted on the buttocks of the infant sheep the\ninitials of her he delighted to muse on--\"B. E.,\" which signified to\nall the region round that henceforth the lambs belonged to Farmer\nBathsheba Everdene, and to no one else.\n\n\"Now, Cainy, shoulder your two, and off. Good morning, Mr. Boldwood.\"\nThe shepherd lifted the sixteen large legs and four small bodies he\nhad himself brought, and vanished with them in the direction of the\nlambing field hard by--their frames being now in a sleek and hopeful\nstate, pleasantly contrasting with their death's-door plight of half\nan hour before.\n\nBoldwood followed him a little way up the field, hesitated, and\nturned back.  He followed him again with a last resolve, annihilating\nreturn.  On approaching the nook in which the fold was constructed,\nthe farmer drew out his pocket-book, unfastened it, and allowed it to\nlie open on his hand.  A letter was revealed--Bathsheba's.\n\n\"I was going to ask you, Oak,\" he said, with unreal carelessness, \"if\nyou know whose writing this is?\"\n\nOak glanced into the book, and replied instantly, with a flushed\nface, \"Miss Everdene's.\"\n\nOak had coloured simply at the consciousness of sounding her name.\nHe now felt a strangely distressing qualm from a new thought.  The\nletter could of course be no other than anonymous, or the inquiry\nwould not have been necessary.\n\nBoldwood mistook his confusion: sensitive persons are always ready\nwith their \"Is it I?\" in preference to objective reasoning.\n\n\"The question was perfectly fair,\" he returned--and there was\nsomething incongruous in the serious earnestness with which he\napplied himself to an argument on a valentine.  \"You know it is\nalways expected that privy inquiries will be made: that's where\nthe--fun lies.\"  If the word \"fun\" had been \"torture,\" it could not\nhave been uttered with a more constrained and restless countenance\nthan was Boldwood's then.\n\nSoon parting from Gabriel, the lonely and reserved man returned to\nhis house to breakfast--feeling twinges of shame and regret at having\nso far exposed his mood by those fevered questions to a stranger.  He\nagain placed the letter on the mantelpiece, and sat down to think of\nthe circumstances attending it by the light of Gabriel's information.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nALL SAINTS' AND ALL SOULS'\n\n\nOn a week-day morning a small congregation, consisting mainly of\nwomen and girls, rose from its knees in the mouldy nave of a church\ncalled All Saints', in the distant barrack-town before-mentioned, at\nthe end of a service without a sermon.  They were about to disperse,\nwhen a smart footstep, entering the porch and coming up the central\npassage, arrested their attention.  The step echoed with a ring\nunusual in a church; it was the clink of spurs.  Everybody looked.  A\nyoung cavalry soldier in a red uniform, with the three chevrons of a\nsergeant upon his sleeve, strode up the aisle, with an embarrassment\nwhich was only the more marked by the intense vigour of his step, and\nby the determination upon his face to show none.  A slight flush had\nmounted his cheek by the time he had run the gauntlet between these\nwomen; but, passing on through the chancel arch, he never paused till\nhe came close to the altar railing.  Here for a moment he stood\nalone.\n\nThe officiating curate, who had not yet doffed his surplice,\nperceived the new-comer, and followed him to the communion-space.  He\nwhispered to the soldier, and then beckoned to the clerk, who in his\nturn whispered to an elderly woman, apparently his wife, and they\nalso went up the chancel steps.\n\n\"'Tis a wedding!\" murmured some of the women, brightening.  \"Let's\nwait!\"\n\nThe majority again sat down.\n\nThere was a creaking of machinery behind, and some of the young ones\nturned their heads.  From the interior face of the west wall of the\ntower projected a little canopy with a quarter-jack and small bell\nbeneath it, the automaton being driven by the same clock machinery\nthat struck the large bell in the tower.  Between the tower and the\nchurch was a close screen, the door of which was kept shut during\nservices, hiding this grotesque clockwork from sight.  At present,\nhowever, the door was open, and the egress of the jack, the blows on\nthe bell, and the mannikin's retreat into the nook again, were\nvisible to many, and audible throughout the church.\n\nThe jack had struck half-past eleven.\n\n\"Where's the woman?\" whispered some of the spectators.\n\nThe young sergeant stood still with the abnormal rigidity of the old\npillars around.  He faced the south-east, and was as silent as he was\nstill.\n\nThe silence grew to be a noticeable thing as the minutes went on,\nand nobody else appeared, and not a soul moved.  The rattle of the\nquarter-jack again from its niche, its blows for three-quarters, its\nfussy retreat, were almost painfully abrupt, and caused many of the\ncongregation to start palpably.\n\n\"I wonder where the woman is!\" a voice whispered again.\n\nThere began now that slight shifting of feet, that artificial\ncoughing among several, which betrays a nervous suspense.  At length\nthere was a titter.  But the soldier never moved.  There he stood,\nhis face to the south-east, upright as a column, his cap in his hand.\n\nThe clock ticked on.  The women threw off their nervousness, and\ntitters and giggling became more frequent.  Then came a dead silence.\nEvery one was waiting for the end.  Some persons may have noticed how\nextraordinarily the striking of quarters seems to quicken the flight\nof time.  It was hardly credible that the jack had not got wrong with\nthe minutes when the rattle began again, the puppet emerged, and the\nfour quarters were struck fitfully as before.  One could almost be\npositive that there was a malicious leer upon the hideous creature's\nface, and a mischievous delight in its twitchings.  Then followed the\ndull and remote resonance of the twelve heavy strokes in the tower\nabove.  The women were impressed, and there was no giggle this time.\n\nThe clergyman glided into the vestry, and the clerk vanished.  The\nsergeant had not yet turned; every woman in the church was waiting to\nsee his face, and he appeared to know it.  At last he did turn, and\nstalked resolutely down the nave, braving them all, with a compressed\nlip.  Two bowed and toothless old almsmen then looked at each other\nand chuckled, innocently enough; but the sound had a strange weird\neffect in that place.\n\nOpposite to the church was a paved square, around which several\noverhanging wood buildings of old time cast a picturesque shade.  The\nyoung man on leaving the door went to cross the square, when, in the\nmiddle, he met a little woman.  The expression of her face, which had\nbeen one of intense anxiety, sank at the sight of his nearly to\nterror.\n\n\"Well?\" he said, in a suppressed passion, fixedly looking at her.\n\n\"Oh, Frank--I made a mistake!--I thought that church with the spire\nwas All Saints', and I was at the door at half-past eleven to a\nminute as you said.  I waited till a quarter to twelve, and found\nthen that I was in All Souls'.  But I wasn't much frightened, for\nI thought it could be to-morrow as well.\"\n\n\"You fool, for so fooling me!  But say no more.\"\n\n\"Shall it be to-morrow, Frank?\" she asked blankly.\n\n\"To-morrow!\" and he gave vent to a hoarse laugh.  \"I don't go through\nthat experience again for some time, I warrant you!\"\n\n\"But after all,\" she expostulated in a trembling voice, \"the mistake\nwas not such a terrible thing!  Now, dear Frank, when shall it be?\"\n\n\"Ah, when?  God knows!\" he said, with a light irony, and turning from\nher walked rapidly away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nIN THE MARKET-PLACE\n\n\nOn Saturday Boldwood was in Casterbridge market house as usual, when\nthe disturber of his dreams entered and became visible to him.  Adam\nhad awakened from his deep sleep, and behold! there was Eve.  The\nfarmer took courage, and for the first time really looked at her.\n\nMaterial causes and emotional effects are not to be arranged in\nregular equation.  The result from capital employed in the production\nof any movement of a mental nature is sometimes as tremendous as the\ncause itself is absurdly minute.  When women are in a freakish mood,\ntheir usual intuition, either from carelessness or inherent defect,\nseemingly fails to teach them this, and hence it was that Bathsheba\nwas fated to be astonished to-day.\n\nBoldwood looked at her--not slily, critically, or understandingly,\nbut blankly at gaze, in the way a reaper looks up at a passing\ntrain--as something foreign to his element, and but dimly understood.\nTo Boldwood women had been remote phenomena rather than necessary\ncomplements--comets of such uncertain aspect, movement, and\npermanence, that whether their orbits were as geometrical,\nunchangeable, and as subject to laws as his own, or as absolutely\nerratic as they superficially appeared, he had not deemed it his duty\nto consider.\n\nHe saw her black hair, her correct facial curves and profile, and\nthe roundness of her chin and throat.  He saw then the side of her\neyelids, eyes, and lashes, and the shape of her ear.  Next he noticed\nher figure, her skirt, and the very soles of her shoes.\n\nBoldwood thought her beautiful, but wondered whether he was right in\nhis thought, for it seemed impossible that this romance in the flesh,\nif so sweet as he imagined, could have been going on long without\ncreating a commotion of delight among men, and provoking more inquiry\nthan Bathsheba had done, even though that was not a little.  To the\nbest of his judgement neither nature nor art could improve this\nperfect one of an imperfect many.  His heart began to move within\nhim.  Boldwood, it must be remembered, though forty years of age, had\nnever before inspected a woman with the very centre and force of his\nglance; they had struck upon all his senses at wide angles.\n\nWas she really beautiful?  He could not assure himself that his\nopinion was true even now.  He furtively said to a neighbour, \"Is\nMiss Everdene considered handsome?\"\n\n\"Oh yes; she was a good deal noticed the first time she came, if you\nremember.  A very handsome girl indeed.\"\n\nA man is never more credulous than in receiving favourable opinions\non the beauty of a woman he is half, or quite, in love with; a mere\nchild's word on the point has the weight of an R.A.'s.  Boldwood was\nsatisfied now.\n\nAnd this charming woman had in effect said to him, \"Marry me.\"  Why\nshould she have done that strange thing?  Boldwood's blindness to\nthe difference between approving of what circumstances suggest, and\noriginating what they do not suggest, was well matched by Bathsheba's\ninsensibility to the possibly great issues of little beginnings.\n\nShe was at this moment coolly dealing with a dashing young farmer,\nadding up accounts with him as indifferently as if his face had been\nthe pages of a ledger.  It was evident that such a nature as his had\nno attraction for a woman of Bathsheba's taste.  But Boldwood grew\nhot down to his hands with an incipient jealousy; he trod for the\nfirst time the threshold of \"the injured lover's hell.\"  His first\nimpulse was to go and thrust himself between them.  This could be\ndone, but only in one way--by asking to see a sample of her corn.\nBoldwood renounced the idea.  He could not make the request; it was\ndebasing loveliness to ask it to buy and sell, and jarred with his\nconceptions of her.\n\nAll this time Bathsheba was conscious of having broken into that\ndignified stronghold at last.  His eyes, she knew, were following her\neverywhere.  This was a triumph; and had it come naturally, such a\ntriumph would have been the sweeter to her for this piquing delay.\nBut it had been brought about by misdirected ingenuity, and she\nvalued it only as she valued an artificial flower or a wax fruit.\n\nBeing a woman with some good sense in reasoning on subjects wherein\nher heart was not involved, Bathsheba genuinely repented that a freak\nwhich had owed its existence as much to Liddy as to herself, should\never have been undertaken, to disturb the placidity of a man she\nrespected too highly to deliberately tease.\n\nShe that day nearly formed the intention of begging his pardon on\nthe very next occasion of their meeting.  The worst features of this\narrangement were that, if he thought she ridiculed him, an apology\nwould increase the offence by being disbelieved; and if he thought\nshe wanted him to woo her, it would read like additional evidence of\nher forwardness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nBOLDWOOD IN MEDITATION--REGRET\n\n\nBoldwood was tenant of what was called Little Weatherbury Farm, and\nhis person was the nearest approach to aristocracy that this remoter\nquarter of the parish could boast of.  Genteel strangers, whose god\nwas their town, who might happen to be compelled to linger about this\nnook for a day, heard the sound of light wheels, and prayed to see\ngood society, to the degree of a solitary lord, or squire at the very\nleast, but it was only Mr. Boldwood going out for the day.  They\nheard the sound of wheels yet once more, and were re-animated to\nexpectancy: it was only Mr. Boldwood coming home again.\n\nHis house stood recessed from the road, and the stables, which are\nto a farm what a fireplace is to a room, were behind, their lower\nportions being lost amid bushes of laurel.  Inside the blue door,\nopen half-way down, were to be seen at this time the backs and tails\nof half-a-dozen warm and contented horses standing in their stalls;\nand as thus viewed, they presented alternations of roan and bay,\nin shapes like a Moorish arch, the tail being a streak down the\nmidst of each.  Over these, and lost to the eye gazing in from the\nouter light, the mouths of the same animals could be heard busily\nsustaining the above-named warmth and plumpness by quantities of oats\nand hay.  The restless and shadowy figure of a colt wandered about a\nloose-box at the end, whilst the steady grind of all the eaters was\noccasionally diversified by the rattle of a rope or the stamp of a\nfoot.\n\nPacing up and down at the heels of the animals was Farmer Boldwood\nhimself.  This place was his almonry and cloister in one: here, after\nlooking to the feeding of his four-footed dependants, the celibate\nwould walk and meditate of an evening till the moon's rays streamed\nin through the cobwebbed windows, or total darkness enveloped the\nscene.\n\nHis square-framed perpendicularity showed more fully now than in the\ncrowd and bustle of the market-house.  In this meditative walk his\nfoot met the floor with heel and toe simultaneously, and his fine\nreddish-fleshed face was bent downwards just enough to render obscure\nthe still mouth and the well-rounded though rather prominent and\nbroad chin.  A few clear and thread-like horizontal lines were the\nonly interruption to the otherwise smooth surface of his large\nforehead.\n\nThe phases of Boldwood's life were ordinary enough, but his was not\nan ordinary nature.  That stillness, which struck casual observers\nmore than anything else in his character and habit, and seemed so\nprecisely like the rest of inanition, may have been the perfect\nbalance of enormous antagonistic forces--positives and negatives in\nfine adjustment.  His equilibrium disturbed, he was in extremity at\nonce.  If an emotion possessed him at all, it ruled him; a feeling\nnot mastering him was entirely latent.  Stagnant or rapid, it was\nnever slow.  He was always hit mortally, or he was missed.\n\nHe had no light and careless touches in his constitution, either\nfor good or for evil.  Stern in the outlines of action, mild in the\ndetails, he was serious throughout all.  He saw no absurd sides to\nthe follies of life, and thus, though not quite companionable in the\neyes of merry men and scoffers, and those to whom all things show\nlife as a jest, he was not intolerable to the earnest and those\nacquainted with grief.  Being a man who read all the dramas of life\nseriously, if he failed to please when they were comedies, there was\nno frivolous treatment to reproach him for when they chanced to end\ntragically.\n\nBathsheba was far from dreaming that the dark and silent shape upon\nwhich she had so carelessly thrown a seed was a hotbed of tropic\nintensity.  Had she known Boldwood's moods, her blame would have\nbeen fearful, and the stain upon her heart ineradicable.  Moreover,\nhad she known her present power for good or evil over this man, she\nwould have trembled at her responsibility.  Luckily for her present,\nunluckily for her future tranquillity, her understanding had not yet\ntold her what Boldwood was.  Nobody knew entirely; for though it was\npossible to form guesses concerning his wild capabilities from old\nfloodmarks faintly visible, he had never been seen at the high tides\nwhich caused them.\n\nFarmer Boldwood came to the stable-door and looked forth across the\nlevel fields.  Beyond the first enclosure was a hedge, and on the\nother side of this a meadow belonging to Bathsheba's farm.\n\nIt was now early spring--the time of going to grass with the sheep,\nwhen they have the first feed of the meadows, before these are laid\nup for mowing.  The wind, which had been blowing east for several\nweeks, had veered to the southward, and the middle of spring had come\nabruptly--almost without a beginning.  It was that period in the\nvernal quarter when we may suppose the Dryads to be waking for the\nseason.  The vegetable world begins to move and swell and the saps to\nrise, till in the completest silence of lone gardens and trackless\nplantations, where everything seems helpless and still after the\nbond and slavery of frost, there are bustlings, strainings, united\nthrusts, and pulls-all-together, in comparison with which the\npowerful tugs of cranes and pulleys in a noisy city are but pigmy\nefforts.\n\nBoldwood, looking into the distant meadows, saw there three figures.\nThey were those of Miss Everdene, Shepherd Oak, and Cainy Ball.\n\nWhen Bathsheba's figure shone upon the farmer's eyes it lighted him\nup as the moon lights up a great tower.  A man's body is as the\nshell, or the tablet, of his soul, as he is reserved or ingenuous,\noverflowing or self-contained.  There was a change in Boldwood's\nexterior from its former impassibleness; and his face showed that he\nwas now living outside his defences for the first time, and with a\nfearful sense of exposure.  It is the usual experience of strong\nnatures when they love.\n\nAt last he arrived at a conclusion.  It was to go across and inquire\nboldly of her.\n\nThe insulation of his heart by reserve during these many years,\nwithout a channel of any kind for disposable emotion, had worked its\neffect.  It has been observed more than once that the causes of love\nare chiefly subjective, and Boldwood was a living testimony to the\ntruth of the proposition.  No mother existed to absorb his devotion,\nno sister for his tenderness, no idle ties for sense.  He became\nsurcharged with the compound, which was genuine lover's love.\n\nHe approached the gate of the meadow.  Beyond it the ground was\nmelodious with ripples, and the sky with larks; the low bleating of\nthe flock mingling with both.  Mistress and man were engaged in the\noperation of making a lamb \"take,\" which is performed whenever an ewe\nhas lost her own offspring, one of the twins of another ewe being\ngiven her as a substitute.  Gabriel had skinned the dead lamb, and\nwas tying the skin over the body of the live lamb, in the customary\nmanner, whilst Bathsheba was holding open a little pen of four\nhurdles, into which the Mother and foisted lamb were driven, where\nthey would remain till the old sheep conceived an affection for the\nyoung one.\n\nBathsheba looked up at the completion of the manoeuvre and saw the\nfarmer by the gate, where he was overhung by a willow tree in full\nbloom.  Gabriel, to whom her face was as the uncertain glory of an\nApril day, was ever regardful of its faintest changes, and instantly\ndiscerned thereon the mark of some influence from without, in the\nform of a keenly self-conscious reddening.  He also turned and beheld\nBoldwood.\n\nAt once connecting these signs with the letter Boldwood had shown\nhim, Gabriel suspected her of some coquettish procedure begun by that\nmeans, and carried on since, he knew not how.\n\nFarmer Boldwood had read the pantomime denoting that they were aware\nof his presence, and the perception was as too much light turned upon\nhis new sensibility.  He was still in the road, and by moving on he\nhoped that neither would recognize that he had originally intended\nto enter the field.  He passed by with an utter and overwhelming\nsensation of ignorance, shyness, and doubt.  Perhaps in her manner\nthere were signs that she wished to see him--perhaps not--he could\nnot read a woman.  The cabala of this erotic philosophy seemed to\nconsist of the subtlest meanings expressed in misleading ways.  Every\nturn, look, word, and accent contained a mystery quite distinct from\nits obvious import, and not one had ever been pondered by him until\nnow.\n\nAs for Bathsheba, she was not deceived into the belief that Farmer\nBoldwood had walked by on business or in idleness.  She collected\nthe probabilities of the case, and concluded that she was herself\nresponsible for Boldwood's appearance there.  It troubled her much\nto see what a great flame a little wildfire was likely to kindle.\nBathsheba was no schemer for marriage, nor was she deliberately a\ntrifler with the affections of men, and a censor's experience on\nseeing an actual flirt after observing her would have been a feeling\nof surprise that Bathsheba could be so different from such a one,\nand yet so like what a flirt is supposed to be.\n\nShe resolved never again, by look or by sign, to interrupt the steady\nflow of this man's life.  But a resolution to avoid an evil is\nseldom framed till the evil is so far advanced as to make avoidance\nimpossible.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nTHE SHEEP-WASHING--THE OFFER\n\n\nBoldwood did eventually call upon her.  She was not at home.  \"Of\ncourse not,\" he murmured.  In contemplating Bathsheba as a woman, he\nhad forgotten the accidents of her position as an agriculturist--that\nbeing as much of a farmer, and as extensive a farmer, as himself,\nher probable whereabouts was out-of-doors at this time of the year.\nThis, and the other oversights Boldwood was guilty of, were natural\nto the mood, and still more natural to the circumstances.  The\ngreat aids to idealization in love were present here: occasional\nobservation of her from a distance, and the absence of social\nintercourse with her--visual familiarity, oral strangeness.  The\nsmaller human elements were kept out of sight; the pettinesses that\nenter so largely into all earthly living and doing were disguised by\nthe accident of lover and loved-one not being on visiting terms; and\nthere was hardly awakened a thought in Boldwood that sorry household\nrealities appertained to her, or that she, like all others, had\nmoments of commonplace, when to be least plainly seen was to be most\nprettily remembered.  Thus a mild sort of apotheosis took place\nin his fancy, whilst she still lived and breathed within his own\nhorizon, a troubled creature like himself.\n\nIt was the end of May when the farmer determined to be no longer\nrepulsed by trivialities or distracted by suspense.  He had by this\ntime grown used to being in love; the passion now startled him less\neven when it tortured him more, and he felt himself adequate to the\nsituation.  On inquiring for her at her house they had told him she\nwas at the sheep-washing, and he went off to seek her there.\n\nThe sheep-washing pool was a perfectly circular basin of brickwork in\nthe meadows, full of the clearest water.  To birds on the wing its\nglassy surface, reflecting the light sky, must have been visible for\nmiles around as a glistening Cyclops' eye in a green face.  The grass\nabout the margin at this season was a sight to remember long--in a\nminor sort of way.  Its activity in sucking the moisture from the\nrich damp sod was almost a process observable by the eye.  The\noutskirts of this level water-meadow were diversified by rounded and\nhollow pastures, where just now every flower that was not a buttercup\nwas a daisy.  The river slid along noiselessly as a shade, the\nswelling reeds and sedge forming a flexible palisade upon its moist\nbrink.  To the north of the mead were trees, the leaves of which\nwere new, soft, and moist, not yet having stiffened and darkened\nunder summer sun and drought, their colour being yellow beside a\ngreen--green beside a yellow.  From the recesses of this knot of\nfoliage the loud notes of three cuckoos were resounding through the\nstill air.\n\nBoldwood went meditating down the slopes with his eyes on his boots,\nwhich the yellow pollen from the buttercups had bronzed in artistic\ngradations.  A tributary of the main stream flowed through the\nbasin of the pool by an inlet and outlet at opposite points of its\ndiameter.  Shepherd Oak, Jan Coggan, Moon, Poorgrass, Cain Ball,\nand several others were assembled here, all dripping wet to the\nvery roots of their hair, and Bathsheba was standing by in a new\nriding-habit--the most elegant she had ever worn--the reins of her\nhorse being looped over her arm.  Flagons of cider were rolling about\nupon the green.  The meek sheep were pushed into the pool by Coggan\nand Matthew Moon, who stood by the lower hatch, immersed to their\nwaists; then Gabriel, who stood on the brink, thrust them under as\nthey swam along, with an instrument like a crutch, formed for the\npurpose, and also for assisting the exhausted animals when the wool\nbecame saturated and they began to sink.  They were let out against\nthe stream, and through the upper opening, all impurities flowing\naway below.  Cainy Ball and Joseph, who performed this latter\noperation, were if possible wetter than the rest; they resembled\ndolphins under a fountain, every protuberance and angle of their\nclothes dribbling forth a small rill.\n\nBoldwood came close and bade her good morning, with such constraint\nthat she could not but think he had stepped across to the washing for\nits own sake, hoping not to find her there; more, she fancied his\nbrow severe and his eye slighting.  Bathsheba immediately contrived\nto withdraw, and glided along by the river till she was a stone's\nthrow off.  She heard footsteps brushing the grass, and had a\nconsciousness that love was encircling her like a perfume.  Instead\nof turning or waiting, Bathsheba went further among the high sedges,\nbut Boldwood seemed determined, and pressed on till they were\ncompletely past the bend of the river. Here, without being seen,\nthey could hear the splashing and shouts of the washers above.\n\n\"Miss Everdene!\" said the farmer.\n\nShe trembled, turned, and said \"Good morning.\"  His tone was so\nutterly removed from all she had expected as a beginning.  It was\nlowness and quiet accentuated: an emphasis of deep meanings, their\nform, at the same time, being scarcely expressed.  Silence has\nsometimes a remarkable power of showing itself as the disembodied\nsoul of feeling wandering without its carcase, and it is then more\nimpressive than speech.  In the same way, to say a little is often to\ntell more than to say a great deal.  Boldwood told everything in that\nword.\n\nAs the consciousness expands on learning that what was fancied to\nbe the rumble of wheels is the reverberation of thunder, so did\nBathsheba's at her intuitive conviction.\n\n\"I feel--almost too much--to think,\" he said, with a solemn\nsimplicity.  \"I have come to speak to you without preface.  My life\nis not my own since I have beheld you clearly, Miss Everdene--I come\nto make you an offer of marriage.\"\n\nBathsheba tried to preserve an absolutely neutral countenance, and\nall the motion she made was that of closing lips which had previously\nbeen a little parted.\n\n\"I am now forty-one years old,\" he went on.  \"I may have been called\na confirmed bachelor, and I was a confirmed bachelor.  I had never\nany views of myself as a husband in my earlier days, nor have I made\nany calculation on the subject since I have been older.  But we all\nchange, and my change, in this matter, came with seeing you.  I have\nfelt lately, more and more, that my present way of living is bad in\nevery respect.  Beyond all things, I want you as my wife.\"\n\n\"I feel, Mr. Boldwood, that though I respect you much, I do not\nfeel--what would justify me to--in accepting your offer,\" she\nstammered.\n\nThis giving back of dignity for dignity seemed to open the sluices of\nfeeling that Boldwood had as yet kept closed.\n\n\"My life is a burden without you,\" he exclaimed, in a low voice.  \"I\nwant you--I want you to let me say I love you again and again!\"\n\nBathsheba answered nothing, and the horse upon her arm seemed so\nimpressed that instead of cropping the herbage she looked up.\n\n\"I think and hope you care enough for me to listen to what I have to\ntell!\"\n\nBathsheba's momentary impulse at hearing this was to ask why he\nthought that, till she remembered that, far from being a conceited\nassumption on Boldwood's part, it was but the natural conclusion of\nserious reflection based on deceptive premises of her own offering.\n\n\"I wish I could say courteous flatteries to you,\" the farmer\ncontinued in an easier tone, \"and put my rugged feeling into a\ngraceful shape: but I have neither power nor patience to learn such\nthings.  I want you for my wife--so wildly that no other feeling can\nabide in me; but I should not have spoken out had I not been led to\nhope.\"\n\n\"The valentine again!  O that valentine!\" she said to herself, but\nnot a word to him.\n\n\"If you can love me say so, Miss Everdene.  If not--don't say no!\"\n\n\"Mr. Boldwood, it is painful to have to say I am surprised, so that\nI don't know how to answer you with propriety and respect--but am\nonly just able to speak out my feeling--I mean my meaning; that I am\nafraid I can't marry you, much as I respect you.  You are too\ndignified for me to suit you, sir.\"\n\n\"But, Miss Everdene!\"\n\n\"I--I didn't--I know I ought never to have dreamt of sending that\nvalentine--forgive me, sir--it was a wanton thing which no woman with\nany self-respect should have done.  If you will only pardon my\nthoughtlessness, I promise never to--\"\n\n\"No, no, no.  Don't say thoughtlessness!  Make me think it was\nsomething more--that it was a sort of prophetic instinct--the\nbeginning of a feeling that you would like me.  You torture me to say\nit was done in thoughtlessness--I never thought of it in that light,\nand I can't endure it. Ah!  I wish I knew how to win you! but that I\ncan't do--I can only ask if I have already got you.  If I have not,\nand it is not true that you have come unwittingly to me as I have to\nyou, I can say no more.\"\n\n\"I have not fallen in love with you, Mr. Boldwood--certainly I must\nsay that.\"  She allowed a very small smile to creep for the first\ntime over her serious face in saying this, and the white row of upper\nteeth, and keenly-cut lips already noticed, suggested an idea of\nheartlessness, which was immediately contradicted by the pleasant\neyes.\n\n\"But you will just think--in kindness and condescension think--if you\ncannot bear with me as a husband!  I fear I am too old for you, but\nbelieve me I will take more care of you than would many a man of your\nown age.  I will protect and cherish you with all my strength--I will\nindeed!  You shall have no cares--be worried by no household affairs,\nand live quite at ease, Miss Everdene.  The dairy superintendence\nshall be done by a man--I can afford it well--you shall never have\nso much as to look out of doors at haymaking time, or to think of\nweather in the harvest.  I rather cling to the chaise, because it is\nthe same my poor father and mother drove, but if you don't like it\nI will sell it, and you shall have a pony-carriage of your own.  I\ncannot say how far above every other idea and object on earth you\nseem to me--nobody knows--God only knows--how much you are to me!\"\n\nBathsheba's heart was young, and it swelled with sympathy for the\ndeep-natured man who spoke so simply.\n\n\"Don't say it! don't!  I cannot bear you to feel so much, and me to\nfeel nothing.  And I am afraid they will notice us, Mr. Boldwood.\nWill you let the matter rest now?  I cannot think collectedly.  I did\nnot know you were going to say this to me.  Oh, I am wicked to have\nmade you suffer so!\"  She was frightened as well as agitated at his\nvehemence.\n\n\"Say then, that you don't absolutely refuse.  Do not quite refuse?\"\n\n\"I can do nothing.  I cannot answer.\"\n\n\"I may speak to you again on the subject?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I may think of you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose you may think of me.\"\n\n\"And hope to obtain you?\"\n\n\"No--do not hope!  Let us go on.\"\n\n\"I will call upon you again to-morrow.\"\n\n\"No--please not.  Give me time.\"\n\n\"Yes--I will give you any time,\" he said earnestly and gratefully.\n\"I am happier now.\"\n\n\"No--I beg you!  Don't be happier if happiness only comes from my\nagreeing.  Be neutral, Mr. Boldwood!  I must think.\"\n\n\"I will wait,\" he said.\n\nAnd then she turned away.  Boldwood dropped his gaze to the ground,\nand stood long like a man who did not know where he was.  Realities\nthen returned upon him like the pain of a wound received in an\nexcitement which eclipses it, and he, too, then went on.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nPERPLEXITY--GRINDING THE SHEARS--A QUARREL\n\n\n\"He is so disinterested and kind to offer me all that I can desire,\"\nBathsheba mused.\n\nYet Farmer Boldwood, whether by nature kind or the reverse to kind,\ndid not exercise kindness, here.  The rarest offerings of the purest\nloves are but a self-indulgence, and no generosity at all.\n\nBathsheba, not being the least in love with him, was eventually able\nto look calmly at his offer.  It was one which many women of her own\nstation in the neighbourhood, and not a few of higher rank, would\nhave been wild to accept and proud to publish.  In every point of\nview, ranging from politic to passionate, it was desirable that she,\na lonely girl, should marry, and marry this earnest, well-to-do,\nand respected man.  He was close to her doors: his standing was\nsufficient: his qualities were even supererogatory.  Had she felt,\nwhich she did not, any wish whatever for the married state in the\nabstract, she could not reasonably have rejected him, being a woman\nwho frequently appealed to her understanding for deliverance from\nher whims.  Boldwood as a means to marriage was unexceptionable: she\nesteemed and liked him, yet she did not want him.  It appears that\nordinary men take wives because possession is not possible without\nmarriage, and that ordinary women accept husbands because marriage\nis not possible without possession; with totally differing aims the\nmethod is the same on both sides.  But the understood incentive on\nthe woman's part was wanting here.  Besides, Bathsheba's position\nas absolute mistress of a farm and house was a novel one, and the\nnovelty had not yet begun to wear off.\n\nBut a disquiet filled her which was somewhat to her credit, for it\nwould have affected few.  Beyond the mentioned reasons with which\nshe combated her objections, she had a strong feeling that, having\nbeen the one who began the game, she ought in honesty to accept the\nconsequences.  Still the reluctance remained.  She said in the same\nbreath that it would be ungenerous not to marry Boldwood, and that\nshe couldn't do it to save her life.\n\nBathsheba's was an impulsive nature under a deliberative aspect.  An\nElizabeth in brain and a Mary Stuart in spirit, she often performed\nactions of the greatest temerity with a manner of extreme discretion.\nMany of her thoughts were perfect syllogisms; unluckily they always\nremained thoughts. Only a few were irrational assumptions; but,\nunfortunately, they were the ones which most frequently grew into\ndeeds.\n\nThe next day to that of the declaration she found Gabriel Oak at the\nbottom of her garden, grinding his shears for the sheep-shearing.\nAll the surrounding cottages were more or less scenes of the same\noperation; the scurr of whetting spread into the sky from all parts\nof the village as from an armoury previous to a campaign.  Peace and\nwar kiss each other at their hours of preparation--sickles, scythes,\nshears, and pruning-hooks, ranking with swords, bayonets, and lances,\nin their common necessity for point and edge.\n\nCainy Ball turned the handle of Gabriel's grindstone, his head\nperforming a melancholy see-saw up and down with each turn of the\nwheel.  Oak stood somewhat as Eros is represented when in the act of\nsharpening his arrows: his figure slightly bent, the weight of his\nbody thrown over on the shears, and his head balanced side-ways, with\na critical compression of the lips and contraction of the eyelids to\ncrown the attitude.\n\nHis mistress came up and looked upon them in silence for a minute or\ntwo; then she said--\n\n\"Cain, go to the lower mead and catch the bay mare.  I'll turn the\nwinch of the grindstone.  I want to speak to you, Gabriel.\"\n\nCain departed, and Bathsheba took the handle.  Gabriel had glanced up\nin intense surprise, quelled its expression, and looked down again.\nBathsheba turned the winch, and Gabriel applied the shears.\n\nThe peculiar motion involved in turning a wheel has a wonderful\ntendency to benumb the mind.  It is a sort of attenuated variety of\nIxion's punishment, and contributes a dismal chapter to the history\nof gaols.  The brain gets muddled, the head grows heavy, and the\nbody's centre of gravity seems to settle by degrees in a leaden lump\nsomewhere between the eyebrows and the crown.  Bathsheba felt the\nunpleasant symptoms after two or three dozen turns.\n\n\"Will you turn, Gabriel, and let me hold the shears?\" she said.  \"My\nhead is in a whirl, and I can't talk.\"\n\nGabriel turned.  Bathsheba then began, with some awkwardness,\nallowing her thoughts to stray occasionally from her story to attend\nto the shears, which required a little nicety in sharpening.\n\n\"I wanted to ask you if the men made any observations on my going\nbehind the sedge with Mr. Boldwood yesterday?\"\n\n\"Yes, they did,\" said Gabriel.  \"You don't hold the shears right,\nmiss--I knew you wouldn't know the way--hold like this.\"\n\nHe relinquished the winch, and inclosing her two hands completely in\nhis own (taking each as we sometimes slap a child's hand in teaching\nhim to write), grasped the shears with her.  \"Incline the edge so,\"\nhe said.\n\nHands and shears were inclined to suit the words, and held thus for a\npeculiarly long time by the instructor as he spoke.\n\n\"That will do,\" exclaimed Bathsheba.  \"Loose my hands.  I won't have\nthem held!  Turn the winch.\"\n\nGabriel freed her hands quietly, retired to his handle, and the\ngrinding went on.\n\n\"Did the men think it odd?\" she said again.\n\n\"Odd was not the idea, miss.\"\n\n\"What did they say?\"\n\n\"That Farmer Boldwood's name and your own were likely to be flung\nover pulpit together before the year was out.\"\n\n\"I thought so by the look of them!  Why, there's nothing in it.  A\nmore foolish remark was never made, and I want you to contradict it!\nthat's what I came for.\"\n\nGabriel looked incredulous and sad, but between his moments of\nincredulity, relieved.\n\n\"They must have heard our conversation,\" she continued.\n\n\"Well, then, Bathsheba!\" said Oak, stopping the handle, and gazing\ninto her face with astonishment.\n\n\"Miss Everdene, you mean,\" she said, with dignity.\n\n\"I mean this, that if Mr. Boldwood really spoke of marriage, I bain't\ngoing to tell a story and say he didn't to please you.  I have\nalready tried to please you too much for my own good!\"\n\nBathsheba regarded him with round-eyed perplexity.  She did not know\nwhether to pity him for disappointed love of her, or to be angry with\nhim for having got over it--his tone being ambiguous.\n\n\"I said I wanted you just to mention that it was not true I was going\nto be married to him,\" she murmured, with a slight decline in her\nassurance.\n\n\"I can say that to them if you wish, Miss Everdene.  And I could\nlikewise give an opinion to 'ee on what you have done.\"\n\n\"I daresay.  But I don't want your opinion.\"\n\n\"I suppose not,\" said Gabriel bitterly, and going on with his\nturning, his words rising and falling in a regular swell and cadence\nas he stooped or rose with the winch, which directed them, according\nto his position, perpendicularly into the earth, or horizontally\nalong the garden, his eyes being fixed on a leaf upon the ground.\n\nWith Bathsheba a hastened act was a rash act; but, as does not always\nhappen, time gained was prudence insured.  It must be added, however,\nthat time was very seldom gained.  At this period the single opinion\nin the parish on herself and her doings that she valued as sounder\nthan her own was Gabriel Oak's.  And the outspoken honesty of his\ncharacter was such that on any subject, even that of her love for,\nor marriage with, another man, the same disinterestedness of opinion\nmight be calculated on, and be had for the asking.  Thoroughly\nconvinced of the impossibility of his own suit, a high resolve\nconstrained him not to injure that of another.  This is a lover's\nmost stoical virtue, as the lack of it is a lover's most venial sin.\nKnowing he would reply truly she asked the question, painful as\nshe must have known the subject would be.  Such is the selfishness\nof some charming women.  Perhaps it was some excuse for her thus\ntorturing honesty to her own advantage, that she had absolutely no\nother sound judgment within easy reach.\n\n\"Well, what is your opinion of my conduct,\" she said, quietly.\n\n\"That it is unworthy of any thoughtful, and meek, and comely woman.\"\n\nIn an instant Bathsheba's face coloured with the angry crimson of\na Danby sunset.  But she forbore to utter this feeling, and the\nreticence of her tongue only made the loquacity of her face the more\nnoticeable.\n\nThe next thing Gabriel did was to make a mistake.\n\n\"Perhaps you don't like the rudeness of my reprimanding you, for I\nknow it is rudeness; but I thought it would do good.\"\n\nShe instantly replied sarcastically--\n\n\"On the contrary, my opinion of you is so low, that I see in your\nabuse the praise of discerning people!\"\n\n\"I am glad you don't mind it, for I said it honestly and with every\nserious meaning.\"\n\n\"I see.  But, unfortunately, when you try not to speak in jest you\nare amusing--just as when you wish to avoid seriousness you sometimes\nsay a sensible word.\"\n\nIt was a hard hit, but Bathsheba had unmistakably lost her temper,\nand on that account Gabriel had never in his life kept his own\nbetter.  He said nothing.  She then broke out--\n\n\"I may ask, I suppose, where in particular my unworthiness lies?  In\nmy not marrying you, perhaps!\"\n\n\"Not by any means,\" said Gabriel quietly.  \"I have long given up\nthinking of that matter.\"\n\n\"Or wishing it, I suppose,\" she said; and it was apparent that she\nexpected an unhesitating denial of this supposition.\n\nWhatever Gabriel felt, he coolly echoed her words--\n\n\"Or wishing it either.\"\n\nA woman may be treated with a bitterness which is sweet to her,\nand with a rudeness which is not offensive.  Bathsheba would have\nsubmitted to an indignant chastisement for her levity had Gabriel\nprotested that he was loving her at the same time; the impetuosity\nof passion unrequited is bearable, even if it stings and\nanathematizes--there is a triumph in the humiliation, and a\ntenderness in the strife.  This was what she had been expecting,\nand what she had not got.  To be lectured because the lecturer saw\nher in the cold morning light of open-shuttered disillusion was\nexasperating.  He had not finished, either.  He continued in a more\nagitated voice:--\n\n\"My opinion is (since you ask it) that you are greatly to blame for\nplaying pranks upon a man like Mr. Boldwood, merely as a pastime.\nLeading on a man you don't care for is not a praiseworthy action.\nAnd even, Miss Everdene, if you seriously inclined towards him, you\nmight have let him find it out in some way of true loving-kindness,\nand not by sending him a valentine's letter.\"\n\nBathsheba laid down the shears.\n\n\"I cannot allow any man to--to criticise my private conduct!\" she\nexclaimed.  \"Nor will I for a minute.  So you'll please leave the\nfarm at the end of the week!\"\n\nIt may have been a peculiarity--at any rate it was a fact--that when\nBathsheba was swayed by an emotion of an earthly sort her lower lip\ntrembled: when by a refined emotion, her upper or heavenward one.\nHer nether lip quivered now.\n\n\"Very well, so I will,\" said Gabriel calmly.  He had been held to\nher by a beautiful thread which it pained him to spoil by breaking,\nrather than by a chain he could not break.  \"I should be even better\npleased to go at once,\" he added.\n\n\"Go at once then, in Heaven's name!\" said she, her eyes flashing at\nhis, though never meeting them.  \"Don't let me see your face any\nmore.\"\n\n\"Very well, Miss Everdene--so it shall be.\"\n\nAnd he took his shears and went away from her in placid dignity, as\nMoses left the presence of Pharaoh.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nTROUBLES IN THE FOLD--A MESSAGE\n\n\nGabriel Oak had ceased to feed the Weatherbury flock for about\nfour-and-twenty hours, when on Sunday afternoon the elderly gentlemen\nJoseph Poorgrass, Matthew Moon, Fray, and half-a-dozen others, came\nrunning up to the house of the mistress of the Upper Farm.\n\n\"Whatever IS the matter, men?\" she said, meeting them at the door\njust as she was coming out on her way to church, and ceasing in a\nmoment from the close compression of her two red lips, with which\nshe had accompanied the exertion of pulling on a tight glove.\n\n\"Sixty!\" said Joseph Poorgrass.\n\n\"Seventy!\" said Moon.\n\n\"Fifty-nine!\" said Susan Tall's husband.\n\n\"--Sheep have broke fence,\" said Fray.\n\n\"--And got into a field of young clover,\" said Tall.\n\n\"--Young clover!\" said Moon.\n\n\"--Clover!\" said Joseph Poorgrass.\n\n\"And they be getting blasted,\" said Henery Fray.\n\n\"That they be,\" said Joseph.\n\n\"And will all die as dead as nits, if they bain't got out and cured!\"\nsaid Tall.\n\nJoseph's countenance was drawn into lines and puckers by his concern.\nFray's forehead was wrinkled both perpendicularly and crosswise,\nafter the pattern of a portcullis, expressive of a double despair.\nLaban Tall's lips were thin, and his face was rigid.  Matthew's jaws\nsank, and his eyes turned whichever way the strongest muscle happened\nto pull them.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Joseph, \"and I was sitting at home, looking for\nEphesians, and says I to myself, ''Tis nothing but Corinthians and\nThessalonians in this danged Testament,' when who should come in but\nHenery there: 'Joseph,' he said, 'the sheep have blasted\ntheirselves--'\"\n\nWith Bathsheba it was a moment when thought was speech and speech\nexclamation.  Moreover, she had hardly recovered her equanimity since\nthe disturbance which she had suffered from Oak's remarks.\n\n\"That's enough--that's enough!--oh, you fools!\" she cried, throwing\nthe parasol and Prayer-book into the passage, and running out of\ndoors in the direction signified.  \"To come to me, and not go and get\nthem out directly!  Oh, the stupid numskulls!\"\n\nHer eyes were at their darkest and brightest now.  Bathsheba's beauty\nbelonging rather to the demonian than to the angelic school, she\nnever looked so well as when she was angry--and particularly when the\neffect was heightened by a rather dashing velvet dress, carefully put\non before a glass.\n\nAll the ancient men ran in a jumbled throng after her to the\nclover-field, Joseph sinking down in the midst when about half-way,\nlike an individual withering in a world which was more and more\ninsupportable.  Having once received the stimulus that her presence\nalways gave them they went round among the sheep with a will.  The\nmajority of the afflicted animals were lying down, and could not be\nstirred.  These were bodily lifted out, and the others driven into\nthe adjoining field.  Here, after the lapse of a few minutes, several\nmore fell down, and lay helpless and livid as the rest.\n\nBathsheba, with a sad, bursting heart, looked at these primest\nspecimens of her prime flock as they rolled there--\n\n\n   Swoln with wind and the rank mist they drew.\n\n\nMany of them foamed at the mouth, their breathing being quick and\nshort, whilst the bodies of all were fearfully distended.\n\n\"Oh, what can I do, what can I do!\" said Bathsheba, helplessly.\n\"Sheep are such unfortunate animals!--there's always something\nhappening to them!  I never knew a flock pass a year without getting\ninto some scrape or other.\"\n\n\"There's only one way of saving them,\" said Tall.\n\n\"What way?  Tell me quick!\"\n\n\"They must be pierced in the side with a thing made on purpose.\"\n\n\"Can you do it?  Can I?\"\n\n\"No, ma'am.  We can't, nor you neither.  It must be done in a\nparticular spot.  If ye go to the right or left but an inch you stab\nthe ewe and kill her.  Not even a shepherd can do it, as a rule.\"\n\n\"Then they must die,\" she said, in a resigned tone.\n\n\"Only one man in the neighbourhood knows the way,\" said Joseph, now\njust come up.  \"He could cure 'em all if he were here.\"\n\n\"Who is he?  Let's get him!\"\n\n\"Shepherd Oak,\" said Matthew.  \"Ah, he's a clever man in talents!\"\n\n\"Ah, that he is so!\" said Joseph Poorgrass.\n\n\"True--he's the man,\" said Laban Tall.\n\n\"How dare you name that man in my presence!\" she said excitedly.  \"I\ntold you never to allude to him, nor shall you if you stay with me.\nAh!\" she added, brightening, \"Farmer Boldwood knows!\"\n\n\"O no, ma'am\" said Matthew.  \"Two of his store ewes got into some\nvetches t'other day, and were just like these.  He sent a man on\nhorseback here post-haste for Gable, and Gable went and saved 'em.\nFarmer Boldwood hev got the thing they do it with.  'Tis a holler\npipe, with a sharp pricker inside.  Isn't it, Joseph?\"\n\n\"Ay--a holler pipe,\" echoed Joseph.  \"That's what 'tis.\"\n\n\"Ay, sure--that's the machine,\" chimed in Henery Fray, reflectively,\nwith an Oriental indifference to the flight of time.\n\n\"Well,\" burst out Bathsheba, \"don't stand there with your 'ayes'\nand your 'sures' talking at me!  Get somebody to cure the sheep\ninstantly!\"\n\nAll then stalked off in consternation, to get somebody as directed,\nwithout any idea of who it was to be.  In a minute they had vanished\nthrough the gate, and she stood alone with the dying flock.\n\n\"Never will I send for him--never!\" she said firmly.\n\nOne of the ewes here contracted its muscles horribly, extended\nitself, and jumped high into the air.  The leap was an astonishing\none.  The ewe fell heavily, and lay still.\n\nBathsheba went up to it.  The sheep was dead.\n\n\"Oh, what shall I do--what shall I do!\" she again exclaimed, wringing\nher hands.  \"I won't send for him.  No, I won't!\"\n\nThe most vigorous expression of a resolution does not always coincide\nwith the greatest vigour of the resolution itself.  It is often flung\nout as a sort of prop to support a decaying conviction which, whilst\nstrong, required no enunciation to prove it so.  The \"No, I won't\" of\nBathsheba meant virtually, \"I think I must.\"\n\nShe followed her assistants through the gate, and lifted her hand to\none of them.  Laban answered to her signal.\n\n\"Where is Oak staying?\"\n\n\"Across the valley at Nest Cottage!\"\n\n\"Jump on the bay mare, and ride across, and say he must return\ninstantly--that I say so.\"\n\nTall scrambled off to the field, and in two minutes was on Poll,\nthe bay, bare-backed, and with only a halter by way of rein.  He\ndiminished down the hill.\n\nBathsheba watched.  So did all the rest.  Tall cantered along the\nbridle-path through Sixteen Acres, Sheeplands, Middle Field, The\nFlats, Cappel's Piece, shrank almost to a point, crossed the bridge,\nand ascended from the valley through Springmead and Whitepits on the\nother side.  The cottage to which Gabriel had retired before taking\nhis final departure from the locality was visible as a white spot on\nthe opposite hill, backed by blue firs.  Bathsheba walked up and\ndown.  The men entered the field and endeavoured to ease the anguish\nof the dumb creatures by rubbing them.  Nothing availed.\n\nBathsheba continued walking.  The horse was seen descending the\nhill, and the wearisome series had to be repeated in reverse order:\nWhitepits, Springmead, Cappel's Piece, The Flats, Middle Field,\nSheeplands, Sixteen Acres.  She hoped Tall had had presence of mind\nenough to give the mare up to Gabriel, and return himself on foot.\nThe rider neared them.  It was Tall.\n\n\"Oh, what folly!\" said Bathsheba.\n\nGabriel was not visible anywhere.\n\n\"Perhaps he is already gone!\" she said.\n\nTall came into the inclosure, and leapt off, his face tragic as\nMorton's after the battle of Shrewsbury.\n\n\"Well?\" said Bathsheba, unwilling to believe that her verbal\n_lettre-de-cachet_ could possibly have miscarried.\n\n\"He says BEGGARS MUSTN'T BE CHOOSERS,\" replied Laban.\n\n\"What!\" said the young farmer, opening her eyes and drawing in her\nbreath for an outburst.  Joseph Poorgrass retired a few steps behind\na hurdle.\n\n\"He says he shall not come onless you request en to come civilly and\nin a proper manner, as becomes any 'ooman begging a favour.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh, that's his answer!  Where does he get his airs?  Who am I,\nthen, to be treated like that?  Shall I beg to a man who has begged\nto me?\"\n\nAnother of the flock sprang into the air, and fell dead.\n\nThe men looked grave, as if they suppressed opinion.\n\nBathsheba turned aside, her eyes full of tears.  The strait she was\nin through pride and shrewishness could not be disguised longer: she\nburst out crying bitterly; they all saw it; and she attempted no\nfurther concealment.\n\n\"I wouldn't cry about it, miss,\" said William Smallbury,\ncompassionately.  \"Why not ask him softer like?  I'm sure he'd come\nthen.  Gable is a true man in that way.\"\n\nBathsheba checked her grief and wiped her eyes.  \"Oh, it is a wicked\ncruelty to me--it is--it is!\" she murmured.  \"And he drives me to do\nwhat I wouldn't; yes, he does!--Tall, come indoors.\"\n\nAfter this collapse, not very dignified for the head of an\nestablishment, she went into the house, Tall at her heels.  Here she\nsat down and hastily scribbled a note between the small convulsive\nsobs of convalescence which follow a fit of crying as a ground-swell\nfollows a storm.  The note was none the less polite for being written\nin a hurry.  She held it at a distance, was about to fold it, then\nadded these words at the bottom:--\n\n\n   \"DO NOT DESERT ME, GABRIEL!\"\n\n\nShe looked a little redder in refolding it, and closed her lips,\nas if thereby to suspend till too late the action of conscience in\nexamining whether such strategy were justifiable.  The note was\ndespatched as the message had been, and Bathsheba waited indoors\nfor the result.\n\nIt was an anxious quarter of an hour that intervened between the\nmessenger's departure and the sound of the horse's tramp again\noutside.  She could not watch this time, but, leaning over the old\nbureau at which she had written the letter, closed her eyes, as if\nto keep out both hope and fear.\n\nThe case, however, was a promising one.  Gabriel was not angry: he\nwas simply neutral, although her first command had been so haughty.\nSuch imperiousness would have damned a little less beauty; and\non the other hand, such beauty would have redeemed a little less\nimperiousness.\n\nShe went out when the horse was heard, and looked up.  A mounted\nfigure passed between her and the sky, and drew on towards the field\nof sheep, the rider turning his face in receding.  Gabriel looked at\nher.  It was a moment when a woman's eyes and tongue tell distinctly\nopposite tales. Bathsheba looked full of gratitude, and she said:--\n\n\"Oh, Gabriel, how could you serve me so unkindly!\"\n\nSuch a tenderly-shaped reproach for his previous delay was the\none speech in the language that he could pardon for not being\ncommendation of his readiness now.\n\nGabriel murmured a confused reply, and hastened on.  She knew from\nthe look which sentence in her note had brought him.  Bathsheba\nfollowed to the field.\n\nGabriel was already among the turgid, prostrate forms.  He had flung\noff his coat, rolled up his shirt-sleeves, and taken from his pocket\nthe instrument of salvation.  It was a small tube or trochar, with\na lance passing down the inside; and Gabriel began to use it with a\ndexterity that would have graced a hospital surgeon.  Passing his\nhand over the sheep's left flank, and selecting the proper point, he\npunctured the skin and rumen with the lance as it stood in the tube;\nthen he suddenly withdrew the lance, retaining the tube in its place.\nA current of air rushed up the tube, forcible enough to have\nextinguished a candle held at the orifice.\n\nIt has been said that mere ease after torment is delight for a time;\nand the countenances of these poor creatures expressed it now.\nForty-nine operations were successfully performed.  Owing to the\ngreat hurry necessitated by the far-gone state of some of the flock,\nGabriel missed his aim in one case, and in one only--striking wide\nof the mark, and inflicting a mortal blow at once upon the suffering\newe.  Four had died; three recovered without an operation.  The total\nnumber of sheep which had thus strayed and injured themselves so\ndangerously was fifty-seven.\n\nWhen the love-led man had ceased from his labours, Bathsheba came and\nlooked him in the face.\n\n\"Gabriel, will you stay on with me?\" she said, smiling winningly,\nand not troubling to bring her lips quite together again at the end,\nbecause there was going to be another smile soon.\n\n\"I will,\" said Gabriel.\n\nAnd she smiled on him again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nTHE GREAT BARN AND THE SHEEP-SHEARERS\n\n\nMen thin away to insignificance and oblivion quite as often by not\nmaking the most of good spirits when they have them as by lacking\ngood spirits when they are indispensable.  Gabriel lately, for the\nfirst time since his prostration by misfortune, had been independent\nin thought and vigorous in action to a marked extent--conditions\nwhich, powerless without an opportunity as an opportunity without\nthem is barren, would have given him a sure lift upwards when the\nfavourable conjunction should have occurred.  But this incurable\nloitering beside Bathsheba Everdene stole his time ruinously.  The\nspring tides were going by without floating him off, and the neap\nmight soon come which could not.\n\nIt was the first day of June, and the sheep-shearing season\nculminated, the landscape, even to the leanest pasture, being\nall health and colour.  Every green was young, every pore was\nopen, and every stalk was swollen with racing currents of juice.\nGod was palpably present in the country, and the devil had gone\nwith the world to town.  Flossy catkins of the later kinds,\nfern-sprouts like bishops' croziers, the square-headed moschatel,\nthe odd cuckoo-pint,--like an apoplectic saint in a niche of\nmalachite,--snow-white ladies'-smocks, the toothwort, approximating\nto human flesh, the enchanter's night-shade, and the black-petaled\ndoleful-bells, were among the quainter objects of the vegetable world\nin and about Weatherbury at this teeming time; and of the animal,\nthe metamorphosed figures of Mr. Jan Coggan, the master-shearer; the\nsecond and third shearers, who travelled in the exercise of their\ncalling, and do not require definition by name; Henery Fray the\nfourth shearer, Susan Tall's husband the fifth, Joseph Poorgrass\nthe sixth, young Cain Ball as assistant-shearer, and Gabriel Oak as\ngeneral supervisor.  None of these were clothed to any extent worth\nmentioning, each appearing to have hit in the matter of raiment the\ndecent mean between a high and low caste Hindoo.  An angularity of\nlineament, and a fixity of facial machinery in general, proclaimed\nthat serious work was the order of the day.\n\nThey sheared in the great barn, called for the nonce the\nShearing-barn, which on ground-plan resembled a church with\ntransepts.  It not only emulated the form of the neighbouring church\nof the parish, but vied with it in antiquity.  Whether the barn had\never formed one of a group of conventual buildings nobody seemed to\nbe aware; no trace of such surroundings remained.  The vast porches\nat the sides, lofty enough to admit a waggon laden to its highest\nwith corn in the sheaf, were spanned by heavy-pointed arches of\nstone, broadly and boldly cut, whose very simplicity was the origin\nof a grandeur not apparent in erections where more ornament has been\nattempted.  The dusky, filmed, chestnut roof, braced and tied in\nby huge collars, curves, and diagonals, was far nobler in design,\nbecause more wealthy in material, than nine-tenths of those in our\nmodern churches.  Along each side wall was a range of striding\nbuttresses, throwing deep shadows on the spaces between them, which\nwere perforated by lancet openings, combining in their proportions\nthe precise requirements both of beauty and ventilation.\n\nOne could say about this barn, what could hardly be said of either\nthe church or the castle, akin to it in age and style, that the\npurpose which had dictated its original erection was the same with\nthat to which it was still applied.  Unlike and superior to either\nof those two typical remnants of medi\u00c3\u00a6valism, the old barn embodied\npractices which had suffered no mutilation at the hands of time.\nHere at least the spirit of the ancient builders was at one with\nthe spirit of the modern beholder.  Standing before this abraded\npile, the eye regarded its present usage, the mind dwelt upon its\npast history, with a satisfied sense of functional continuity\nthroughout--a feeling almost of gratitude, and quite of pride, at the\npermanence of the idea which had heaped it up.  The fact that four\ncenturies had neither proved it to be founded on a mistake, inspired\nany hatred of its purpose, nor given rise to any reaction that had\nbattered it down, invested this simple grey effort of old minds with\na repose, if not a grandeur, which a too curious reflection was apt\nto disturb in its ecclesiastical and military compeers.  For once\nmedi\u00c3\u00a6valism and modernism had a common stand-point.  The lanceolate\nwindows, the time-eaten archstones and chamfers, the orientation of\nthe axis, the misty chestnut work of the rafters, referred to no\nexploded fortifying art or worn-out religious creed.  The defence and\nsalvation of the body by daily bread is still a study, a religion,\nand a desire.\n\nTo-day the large side doors were thrown open towards the sun to admit\na bountiful light to the immediate spot of the shearers' operations,\nwhich was the wood threshing-floor in the centre, formed of thick\noak, black with age and polished by the beating of flails for many\ngenerations, till it had grown as slippery and as rich in hue as\nthe state-room floors of an Elizabethan mansion.  Here the shearers\nknelt, the sun slanting in upon their bleached shirts, tanned arms,\nand the polished shears they flourished, causing these to bristle\nwith a thousand rays strong enough to blind a weak-eyed man.  Beneath\nthem a captive sheep lay panting, quickening its pants as misgiving\nmerged in terror, till it quivered like the hot landscape outside.\n\nThis picture of to-day in its frame of four hundred years ago did\nnot produce that marked contrast between ancient and modern which\nis implied by the contrast of date.  In comparison with cities,\nWeatherbury was immutable.  The citizen's THEN is the rustic's\nNOW.  In London, twenty or thirty-years ago are old times; in Paris\nten years, or five; in Weatherbury three or four score years were\nincluded in the mere present, and nothing less than a century set a\nmark on its face or tone.  Five decades hardly modified the cut of a\ngaiter, the embroidery of a smock-frock, by the breadth of a hair.\nTen generations failed to alter the turn of a single phrase.  In\nthese Wessex nooks the busy outsider's ancient times are only old;\nhis old times are still new; his present is futurity.\n\nSo the barn was natural to the shearers, and the shearers were in\nharmony with the barn.\n\nThe spacious ends of the building, answering ecclesiastically to nave\nand chancel extremities, were fenced off with hurdles, the sheep\nbeing all collected in a crowd within these two enclosures; and in\none angle a catching-pen was formed, in which three or four sheep\nwere continuously kept ready for the shearers to seize without loss\nof time.  In the background, mellowed by tawny shade, were the three\nwomen, Maryann Money, and Temperance and Soberness Miller, gathering\nup the fleeces and twisting ropes of wool with a wimble for tying\nthem round.  They were indifferently well assisted by the old\nmaltster, who, when the malting season from October to April had\npassed, made himself useful upon any of the bordering farmsteads.\n\nBehind all was Bathsheba, carefully watching the men to see that\nthere was no cutting or wounding through carelessness, and that the\nanimals were shorn close.  Gabriel, who flitted and hovered under her\nbright eyes like a moth, did not shear continuously, half his time\nbeing spent in attending to the others and selecting the sheep for\nthem.  At the present moment he was engaged in handing round a mug of\nmild liquor, supplied from a barrel in the corner, and cut pieces of\nbread and cheese.\n\nBathsheba, after throwing a glance here, a caution there, and\nlecturing one of the younger operators who had allowed his last\nfinished sheep to go off among the flock without re-stamping it with\nher initials, came again to Gabriel, as he put down the luncheon to\ndrag a frightened ewe to his shear-station, flinging it over upon its\nback with a dexterous twist of the arm.  He lopped off the tresses\nabout its head, and opened up the neck and collar, his mistress\nquietly looking on.\n\n\"She blushes at the insult,\" murmured Bathsheba, watching the pink\nflush which arose and overspread the neck and shoulders of the ewe\nwhere they were left bare by the clicking shears--a flush which was\nenviable, for its delicacy, by many queens of coteries, and would\nhave been creditable, for its promptness, to any woman in the world.\n\nPoor Gabriel's soul was fed with a luxury of content by having her\nover him, her eyes critically regarding his skilful shears, which\napparently were going to gather up a piece of the flesh at every\nclose, and yet never did so.  Like Guildenstern, Oak was happy in\nthat he was not over happy.  He had no wish to converse with her:\nthat his bright lady and himself formed one group, exclusively their\nown, and containing no others in the world, was enough.\n\nSo the chatter was all on her side.  There is a loquacity that tells\nnothing, which was Bathsheba's; and there is a silence which says\nmuch: that was Gabriel's.  Full of this dim and temperate bliss, he\nwent on to fling the ewe over upon her other side, covering her head\nwith his knee, gradually running the shears line after line round her\ndewlap; thence about her flank and back, and finishing over the tail.\n\n\"Well done, and done quickly!\" said Bathsheba, looking at her watch\nas the last snip resounded.\n\n\"How long, miss?\" said Gabriel, wiping his brow.\n\n\"Three-and-twenty minutes and a half since you took the first lock\nfrom its forehead.  It is the first time that I have ever seen one\ndone in less than half an hour.\"\n\nThe clean, sleek creature arose from its fleece--how perfectly\nlike Aphrodite rising from the foam should have been seen to be\nrealized--looking startled and shy at the loss of its garment, which\nlay on the floor in one soft cloud, united throughout, the portion\nvisible being the inner surface only, which, never before exposed,\nwas white as snow, and without flaw or blemish of the minutest kind.\n\n\"Cain Ball!\"\n\n\"Yes, Mister Oak; here I be!\"\n\nCainy now runs forward with the tar-pot.  \"B. E.\" is newly stamped\nupon the shorn skin, and away the simple dam leaps, panting, over the\nboard into the shirtless flock outside.  Then up comes Maryann;\nthrows the loose locks into the middle of the fleece, rolls it up,\nand carries it into the background as three-and-a-half pounds of\nunadulterated warmth for the winter enjoyment of persons unknown and\nfar away, who will, however, never experience the superlative comfort\nderivable from the wool as it here exists, new and pure--before\nthe unctuousness of its nature whilst in a living state has dried,\nstiffened, and been washed out--rendering it just now as superior\nto anything WOOLLEN as cream is superior to milk-and-water.\n\nBut heartless circumstance could not leave entire Gabriel's happiness\nof this morning.  The rams, old ewes, and two-shear ewes had duly\nundergone their stripping, and the men were proceeding with the\nshear-lings and hogs, when Oak's belief that she was going to stand\npleasantly by and time him through another performance was painfully\ninterrupted by Farmer Boldwood's appearance in the extremest corner\nof the barn.  Nobody seemed to have perceived his entry, but there he\ncertainly was.  Boldwood always carried with him a social atmosphere\nof his own, which everybody felt who came near him; and the talk,\nwhich Bathsheba's presence had somewhat suppressed, was now totally\nsuspended.\n\nHe crossed over towards Bathsheba, who turned to greet him with a\ncarriage of perfect ease.  He spoke to her in low tones, and she\ninstinctively modulated her own to the same pitch, and her voice\nultimately even caught the inflection of his.  She was far from\nhaving a wish to appear mysteriously connected with him; but woman at\nthe impressionable age gravitates to the larger body not only in her\nchoice of words, which is apparent every day, but even in her shades\nof tone and humour, when the influence is great.\n\nWhat they conversed about was not audible to Gabriel, who was too\nindependent to get near, though too concerned to disregard.  The\nissue of their dialogue was the taking of her hand by the courteous\nfarmer to help her over the spreading-board into the bright June\nsunlight outside.  Standing beside the sheep already shorn, they went\non talking again.  Concerning the flock?  Apparently not. Gabriel\ntheorized, not without truth, that in quiet discussion of any matter\nwithin reach of the speakers' eyes, these are usually fixed upon\nit.  Bathsheba demurely regarded a contemptible straw lying upon the\nground, in a way which suggested less ovine criticism than womanly\nembarrassment.  She became more or less red in the cheek, the blood\nwavering in uncertain flux and reflux over the sensitive space\nbetween ebb and flood.  Gabriel sheared on, constrained and sad.\n\nShe left Boldwood's side, and he walked up and down alone for nearly\na quarter of an hour.  Then she reappeared in her new riding-habit of\nmyrtle green, which fitted her to the waist as a rind fits its fruit;\nand young Bob Coggan led on her mare, Boldwood fetching his own horse\nfrom the tree under which it had been tied.\n\nOak's eyes could not forsake them; and in endeavouring to continue\nhis shearing at the same time that he watched Boldwood's manner,\nhe snipped the sheep in the groin.  The animal plunged; Bathsheba\ninstantly gazed towards it, and saw the blood.\n\n\"Oh, Gabriel!\" she exclaimed, with severe remonstrance, \"you who are\nso strict with the other men--see what you are doing yourself!\"\n\nTo an outsider there was not much to complain of in this remark; but\nto Oak, who knew Bathsheba to be well aware that she herself was the\ncause of the poor ewe's wound, because she had wounded the ewe's\nshearer in a still more vital part, it had a sting which the abiding\nsense of his inferiority to both herself and Boldwood was not\ncalculated to heal.  But a manly resolve to recognize boldly that he\nhad no longer a lover's interest in her, helped him occasionally to\nconceal a feeling.\n\n\"Bottle!\" he shouted, in an unmoved voice of routine.  Cainy Ball ran\nup, the wound was anointed, and the shearing continued.\n\nBoldwood gently tossed Bathsheba into the saddle, and before they\nturned away she again spoke out to Oak with the same dominative and\ntantalizing graciousness.\n\n\"I am going now to see Mr. Boldwood's Leicesters.  Take my place in\nthe barn, Gabriel, and keep the men carefully to their work.\"\n\nThe horses' heads were put about, and they trotted away.\n\nBoldwood's deep attachment was a matter of great interest among all\naround him; but, after having been pointed out for so many years\nas the perfect exemplar of thriving bachelorship, his lapse was an\nanticlimax somewhat resembling that of St. John Long's death by\nconsumption in the midst of his proofs that it was not a fatal\ndisease.\n\n\"That means matrimony,\" said Temperance Miller, following them out of\nsight with her eyes.\n\n\"I reckon that's the size o't,\" said Coggan, working along without\nlooking up.\n\n\"Well, better wed over the mixen than over the moor,\" said Laban\nTall, turning his sheep.\n\nHenery Fray spoke, exhibiting miserable eyes at the same time: \"I\ndon't see why a maid should take a husband when she's bold enough\nto fight her own battles, and don't want a home; for 'tis keeping\nanother woman out.  But let it be, for 'tis a pity he and she should\ntrouble two houses.\"\n\nAs usual with decided characters, Bathsheba invariably provoked the\ncriticism of individuals like Henery Fray.  Her emblazoned fault was\nto be too pronounced in her objections, and not sufficiently overt in\nher likings.  We learn that it is not the rays which bodies absorb,\nbut those which they reject, that give them the colours they are\nknown by; and in the same way people are specialized by their\ndislikes and antagonisms, whilst their goodwill is looked upon as no\nattribute at all.\n\nHenery continued in a more complaisant mood: \"I once hinted my mind\nto her on a few things, as nearly as a battered frame dared to do so\nto such a froward piece.  You all know, neighbours, what a man I be,\nand how I come down with my powerful words when my pride is boiling\nwi' scarn?\"\n\n\"We do, we do, Henery.\"\n\n\"So I said, 'Mistress Everdene, there's places empty, and there's\ngifted men willing; but the spite'--no, not the spite--I didn't say\nspite--'but the villainy of the contrarikind,' I said (meaning\nwomankind), 'keeps 'em out.'  That wasn't too strong for her, say?\"\n\n\"Passably well put.\"\n\n\"Yes; and I would have said it, had death and salvation overtook me\nfor it.  Such is my spirit when I have a mind.\"\n\n\"A true man, and proud as a lucifer.\"\n\n\"You see the artfulness?  Why, 'twas about being baily really; but\nI didn't put it so plain that she could understand my meaning, so I\ncould lay it on all the stronger.  That was my depth! ... However,\nlet her marry an she will.  Perhaps 'tis high time.  I believe Farmer\nBoldwood kissed her behind the spear-bed at the sheep-washing t'other\nday--that I do.\"\n\n\"What a lie!\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"Ah, neighbour Oak--how'st know?\" said, Henery, mildly.\n\n\"Because she told me all that passed,\" said Oak, with a pharisaical\nsense that he was not as other shearers in this matter.\n\n\"Ye have a right to believe it,\" said Henery, with dudgeon; \"a very\ntrue right.  But I mid see a little distance into things!  To be\nlong-headed enough for a baily's place is a poor mere trifle--yet\na trifle more than nothing.  However, I look round upon life quite\ncool.  Do you heed me, neighbours?  My words, though made as simple\nas I can, mid be rather deep for some heads.\"\n\n\"O yes, Henery, we quite heed ye.\"\n\n\"A strange old piece, goodmen--whirled about from here to yonder, as\nif I were nothing!  A little warped, too.  But I have my depths; ha,\nand even my great depths!  I might gird at a certain shepherd, brain\nto brain.  But no--O no!\"\n\n\"A strange old piece, ye say!\" interposed the maltster, in a\nquerulous voice.  \"At the same time ye be no old man worth naming--no\nold man at all.  Yer teeth bain't half gone yet; and what's a old\nman's standing if so be his teeth bain't gone?  Weren't I stale in\nwedlock afore ye were out of arms?  'Tis a poor thing to be sixty,\nwhen there's people far past four-score--a boast weak as water.\"\n\nIt was the unvarying custom in Weatherbury to sink minor differences\nwhen the maltster had to be pacified.\n\n\"Weak as water! yes,\" said Jan Coggan. \"Malter, we feel ye to be a\nwonderful veteran man, and nobody can gainsay it.\"\n\n\"Nobody,\" said Joseph Poorgrass.  \"Ye be a very rare old spectacle,\nmalter, and we all admire ye for that gift.\"\n\n\"Ay, and as a young man, when my senses were in prosperity, I was\nlikewise liked by a good-few who knowed me,\" said the maltster.\n\n\"'Ithout doubt you was--'ithout doubt.\"\n\nThe bent and hoary man was satisfied, and so apparently was Henery\nFray.  That matters should continue pleasant Maryann spoke, who, what\nwith her brown complexion, and the working wrapper of rusty linsey,\nhad at present the mellow hue of an old sketch in oils--notably some\nof Nicholas Poussin's:--\n\n\"Do anybody know of a crooked man, or a lame, or any second-hand\nfellow at all that would do for poor me?\" said Maryann.  \"A perfect\none I don't expect to get at my time of life.  If I could hear of\nsuch a thing twould do me more good than toast and ale.\"\n\nCoggan furnished a suitable reply.  Oak went on with his shearing,\nand said not another word.  Pestilent moods had come, and teased\naway his quiet.  Bathsheba had shown indications of anointing him\nabove his fellows by installing him as the bailiff that the farm\nimperatively required.  He did not covet the post relatively to the\nfarm: in relation to herself, as beloved by him and unmarried to\nanother, he had coveted it.  His readings of her seemed now to be\nvapoury and indistinct.  His lecture to her was, he thought, one of\nthe absurdest mistakes.  Far from coquetting with Boldwood, she had\ntrifled with himself in thus feigning that she had trifled with\nanother.  He was inwardly convinced that, in accordance with the\nanticipations of his easy-going and worse-educated comrades, that day\nwould see Boldwood the accepted husband of Miss Everdene.  Gabriel\nat this time of his life had out-grown the instinctive dislike which\nevery Christian boy has for reading the Bible, perusing it now\nquite frequently, and he inwardly said, \"'I find more bitter than\ndeath the woman whose heart is snares and nets!'\" This was mere\nexclamation--the froth of the storm.  He adored Bathsheba just the\nsame.\n\n\"We workfolk shall have some lordly junketing to-night,\" said Cainy\nBall, casting forth his thoughts in a new direction.  \"This morning I\nsee 'em making the great puddens in the milking-pails--lumps of fat\nas big as yer thumb, Mister Oak!  I've never seed such splendid large\nknobs of fat before in the days of my life--they never used to be\nbigger then a horse-bean.  And there was a great black crock upon the\nbrandish with his legs a-sticking out, but I don't know what was in\nwithin.\"\n\n\"And there's two bushels of biffins for apple-pies,\" said Maryann.\n\n\"Well, I hope to do my duty by it all,\" said Joseph Poorgrass, in a\npleasant, masticating manner of anticipation.  \"Yes; victuals and\ndrink is a cheerful thing, and gives nerves to the nerveless, if the\nform of words may be used.  'Tis the gospel of the body, without\nwhich we perish, so to speak it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nEVENTIDE--A SECOND DECLARATION\n\n\nFor the shearing-supper a long table was placed on the grass-plot\nbeside the house, the end of the table being thrust over the sill\nof the wide parlour window and a foot or two into the room.  Miss\nEverdene sat inside the window, facing down the table.  She was\nthus at the head without mingling with the men.\n\nThis evening Bathsheba was unusually excited, her red cheeks and lips\ncontrasting lustrously with the mazy skeins of her shadowy hair.  She\nseemed to expect assistance, and the seat at the bottom of the table\nwas at her request left vacant until after they had begun the meal.\nShe then asked Gabriel to take the place and the duties appertaining\nto that end, which he did with great readiness.\n\nAt this moment Mr. Boldwood came in at the gate, and crossed the\ngreen to Bathsheba at the window.  He apologized for his lateness:\nhis arrival was evidently by arrangement.\n\n\"Gabriel,\" said she, \"will you move again, please, and let Mr.\nBoldwood come there?\"\n\nOak moved in silence back to his original seat.\n\nThe gentleman-farmer was dressed in cheerful style, in a new coat\nand white waistcoat, quite contrasting with his usual sober suits of\ngrey.  Inwardy, too, he was blithe, and consequently chatty to an\nexceptional degree.  So also was Bathsheba now that he had come,\nthough the uninvited presence of Pennyways, the bailiff who had been\ndismissed for theft, disturbed her equanimity for a while.\n\nSupper being ended, Coggan began on his own private account, without\nreference to listeners:--\n\n\n   I've lost my love, and I care not,\n   I've lost my love, and I care not;\n     I shall soon have another\n     That's better than t'other;\n   I've lost my love, and I care not.\n\n\nThis lyric, when concluded, was received with a silently appreciative\ngaze at the table, implying that the performance, like a work by\nthose established authors who are independent of notices in the\npapers, was a well-known delight which required no applause.\n\n\"Now, Master Poorgrass, your song!\" said Coggan.\n\n\"I be all but in liquor, and the gift is wanting in me,\" said Joseph,\ndiminishing himself.\n\n\"Nonsense; wou'st never be so ungrateful, Joseph--never!\" said\nCoggan, expressing hurt feelings by an inflection of voice.  \"And\nmistress is looking hard at ye, as much as to say, 'Sing at once,\nJoseph Poorgrass.'\"\n\n\"Faith, so she is; well, I must suffer it! ... Just eye my features,\nand see if the tell-tale blood overheats me much, neighbours?\"\n\n\"No, yer blushes be quite reasonable,\" said Coggan.\n\n\"I always tries to keep my colours from rising when a beauty's eyes\nget fixed on me,\" said Joseph, differently; \"but if so be 'tis willed\nthey do, they must.\"\n\n\"Now, Joseph, your song, please,\" said Bathsheba, from the window.\n\n\"Well, really, ma'am,\" he replied, in a yielding tone, \"I don't know\nwhat to say.  It would be a poor plain ballet of my own composure.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" said the supper-party.\n\nPoorgrass, thus assured, trilled forth a flickering yet commendable\npiece of sentiment, the tune of which consisted of the key-note and\nanother, the latter being the sound chiefly dwelt upon.  This was so\nsuccessful that he rashly plunged into a second in the same breath,\nafter a few false starts:--\n\n\n   I sow'-ed th'-e .....\n   I sow'-ed .....\n   I sow'-ed th'-e seeds' of' love',\n      I-it was' all' i'-in the'-e spring',\n   I-in A'-pril', Ma'-ay, a'-nd sun'-ny' June',\n      When sma'-all bi'-irds they' do' sing.\n\n\n\"Well put out of hand,\" said Coggan, at the end of the verse.  \"'They\ndo sing' was a very taking paragraph.\"\n\n\"Ay; and there was a pretty place at 'seeds of love.' and 'twas well\nheaved out.  Though 'love' is a nasty high corner when a man's voice\nis getting crazed.  Next verse, Master Poorgrass.\"\n\nBut during this rendering young Bob Coggan exhibited one of those\nanomalies which will afflict little people when other persons are\nparticularly serious: in trying to check his laughter, he pushed down\nhis throat as much of the tablecloth as he could get hold of, when,\nafter continuing hermetically sealed for a short time, his mirth\nburst out through his nose.  Joseph perceived it, and with hectic\ncheeks of indignation instantly ceased singing.  Coggan boxed Bob's\nears immediately.\n\n\"Go on, Joseph--go on, and never mind the young scamp,\" said Coggan.\n\"'Tis a very catching ballet.  Now then again--the next bar; I'll\nhelp ye to flourish up the shrill notes where yer wind is rather\nwheezy:--\n\n\n   \"Oh the wi'-il-lo'-ow tree' will' twist',\n   And the wil'-low' tre'-ee wi'-ill twine'.\"\n\n\nBut the singer could not be set going again.  Bob Coggan was sent\nhome for his ill manners, and tranquility was restored by Jacob\nSmallbury, who volunteered a ballad as inclusive and interminable\nas that with which the worthy toper old Silenus amused on a similar\noccasion the swains Chromis and Mnasylus, and other jolly dogs of\nhis day.\n\nIt was still the beaming time of evening, though night was stealthily\nmaking itself visible low down upon the ground, the western lines of\nlight raking the earth without alighting upon it to any extent, or\nilluminating the dead levels at all.  The sun had crept round the\ntree as a last effort before death, and then began to sink, the\nshearers' lower parts becoming steeped in embrowning twilight, whilst\ntheir heads and shoulders were still enjoying day, touched with a\nyellow of self-sustained brilliancy that seemed inherent rather than\nacquired.\n\nThe sun went down in an ochreous mist; but they sat, and talked on,\nand grew as merry as the gods in Homer's heaven.  Bathsheba still\nremained enthroned inside the window, and occupied herself in\nknitting, from which she sometimes looked up to view the fading scene\noutside.  The slow twilight expanded and enveloped them completely\nbefore the signs of moving were shown.\n\nGabriel suddenly missed Farmer Boldwood from his place at the bottom\nof the table.  How long he had been gone Oak did not know; but he\nhad apparently withdrawn into the encircling dusk.  Whilst he was\nthinking of this, Liddy brought candles into the back part of the\nroom overlooking the shearers, and their lively new flames shone down\nthe table and over the men, and dispersed among the green shadows\nbehind.  Bathsheba's form, still in its original position, was now\nagain distinct between their eyes and the light, which revealed that\nBoldwood had gone inside the room, and was sitting near her.\n\nNext came the question of the evening.  Would Miss Everdene sing to\nthem the song she always sang so charmingly--\"The Banks of Allan\nWater\"--before they went home?\n\nAfter a moment's consideration Bathsheba assented, beckoning to\nGabriel, who hastened up into the coveted atmosphere.\n\n\"Have you brought your flute?\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, miss.\"\n\n\"Play to my singing, then.\"\n\nShe stood up in the window-opening, facing the men, the candles\nbehind her, Gabriel on her right hand, immediately outside the\nsash-frame.  Boldwood had drawn up on her left, within the room.\nHer singing was soft and rather tremulous at first, but it soon\nswelled to a steady clearness.  Subsequent events caused one of the\nverses to be remembered for many months, and even years, by more\nthan one of those who were gathered there:--\n\n\n   For his bride a soldier sought her,\n     And a winning tongue had he:\n   On the banks of Allan Water\n     None was gay as she!\n\n\nIn addition to the dulcet piping of Gabriel's flute, Boldwood\nsupplied a bass in his customary profound voice, uttering his notes\nso softly, however, as to abstain entirely from making anything like\nan ordinary duet of the song; they rather formed a rich unexplored\nshadow, which threw her tones into relief.  The shearers reclined\nagainst each other as at suppers in the early ages of the world, and\nso silent and absorbed were they that her breathing could almost be\nheard between the bars; and at the end of the ballad, when the last\ntone loitered on to an inexpressible close, there arose that buzz of\npleasure which is the attar of applause.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to state that Gabriel could not avoid noting\nthe farmer's bearing to-night towards their entertainer.  Yet there\nwas nothing exceptional in his actions beyond what appertained to\nhis time of performing them.  It was when the rest were all looking\naway that Boldwood observed her; when they regarded her he turned\naside; when they thanked or praised he was silent; when they\nwere inattentive he murmured his thanks.  The meaning lay in the\ndifference between actions, none of which had any meaning of itself;\nand the necessity of being jealous, which lovers are troubled with,\ndid not lead Oak to underestimate these signs.\n\nBathsheba then wished them good-night, withdrew from the window, and\nretired to the back part of the room, Boldwood thereupon closing the\nsash and the shutters, and remaining inside with her.  Oak wandered\naway under the quiet and scented trees.  Recovering from the softer\nimpressions produced by Bathsheba's voice, the shearers rose to\nleave, Coggan turning to Pennyways as he pushed back the bench to\npass out:--\n\n\"I like to give praise where praise is due, and the man deserves\nit--that 'a do so,\" he remarked, looking at the worthy thief, as if\nhe were the masterpiece of some world-renowned artist.\n\n\"I'm sure I should never have believed it if we hadn't proved it, so\nto allude,\" hiccupped Joseph Poorgrass, \"that every cup, every one of\nthe best knives and forks, and every empty bottle be in their place\nas perfect now as at the beginning, and not one stole at all.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't deserve half the praise you give me,\" said the\nvirtuous thief, grimly.\n\n\"Well, I'll say this for Pennyways,\" added Coggan, \"that whenever he\ndo really make up his mind to do a noble thing in the shape of a good\naction, as I could see by his face he did to-night afore sitting\ndown, he's generally able to carry it out.  Yes, I'm proud to say,\nneighbours, that he's stole nothing at all.\"\n\n\"Well, 'tis an honest deed, and we thank ye for it, Pennyways,\" said\nJoseph; to which opinion the remainder of the company subscribed\nunanimously.\n\nAt this time of departure, when nothing more was visible of the\ninside of the parlour than a thin and still chink of light between\nthe shutters, a passionate scene was in course of enactment there.\n\nMiss Everdene and Boldwood were alone.  Her cheeks had lost a\ngreat deal of their healthful fire from the very seriousness of\nher position; but her eye was bright with the excitement of a\ntriumph--though it was a triumph which had rather been contemplated\nthan desired.\n\nShe was standing behind a low arm-chair, from which she had just\nrisen, and he was kneeling in it--inclining himself over its back\ntowards her, and holding her hand in both his own.  His body moved\nrestlessly, and it was with what Keats daintily calls a too happy\nhappiness.  This unwonted abstraction by love of all dignity from\na man of whom it had ever seemed the chief component, was, in its\ndistressing incongruity, a pain to her which quenched much of the\npleasure she derived from the proof that she was idolized.\n\n\"I will try to love you,\" she was saying, in a trembling voice quite\nunlike her usual self-confidence.  \"And if I can believe in any way\nthat I shall make you a good wife I shall indeed be willing to marry\nyou.  But, Mr. Boldwood, hesitation on so high a matter is honourable\nin any woman, and I don't want to give a solemn promise to-night.  I\nwould rather ask you to wait a few weeks till I can see my situation\nbetter.\n\n\"But you have every reason to believe that THEN--\"\n\n\"I have every reason to hope that at the end of the five or six\nweeks, between this time and harvest, that you say you are going to\nbe away from home, I shall be able to promise to be your wife,\" she\nsaid, firmly.  \"But remember this distinctly, I don't promise yet.\"\n\n\"It is enough; I don't ask more.  I can wait on those dear words.\nAnd now, Miss Everdene, good-night!\"\n\n\"Good-night,\" she said, graciously--almost tenderly; and Boldwood\nwithdrew with a serene smile.\n\nBathsheba knew more of him now; he had entirely bared his heart\nbefore her, even until he had almost worn in her eyes the sorry look\nof a grand bird without the feathers that make it grand.  She had\nbeen awe-struck at her past temerity, and was struggling to make\namends without thinking whether the sin quite deserved the penalty\nshe was schooling herself to pay.  To have brought all this about her\nears was terrible; but after a while the situation was not without\na fearful joy.  The facility with which even the most timid women\nsometimes acquire a relish for the dreadful when that is amalgamated\nwith a little triumph, is marvellous.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nTHE SAME NIGHT--THE FIR PLANTATION\n\n\nAmong the multifarious duties which Bathsheba had voluntarily imposed\nupon herself by dispensing with the services of a bailiff, was the\nparticular one of looking round the homestead before going to bed,\nto see that all was right and safe for the night.  Gabriel had\nalmost constantly preceded her in this tour every evening, watching\nher affairs as carefully as any specially appointed officer of\nsurveillance could have done; but this tender devotion was to a\ngreat extent unknown to his mistress, and as much as was known was\nsomewhat thanklessly received.  Women are never tired of bewailing\nman's fickleness in love, but they only seem to snub his constancy.\n\nAs watching is best done invisibly, she usually carried a dark\nlantern in her hand, and every now and then turned on the light\nto examine nooks and corners with the coolness of a metropolitan\npoliceman.  This coolness may have owed its existence not so much\nto her fearlessness of expected danger as to her freedom from the\nsuspicion of any; her worst anticipated discovery being that a horse\nmight not be well bedded, the fowls not all in, or a door not closed.\n\nThis night the buildings were inspected as usual, and she went round\nto the farm paddock.  Here the only sounds disturbing the stillness\nwere steady munchings of many mouths, and stentorian breathings from\nall but invisible noses, ending in snores and puffs like the blowing\nof bellows slowly.  Then the munching would recommence, when the\nlively imagination might assist the eye to discern a group of\npink-white nostrils, shaped as caverns, and very clammy and humid on\ntheir surfaces, not exactly pleasant to the touch until one got used\nto them; the mouths beneath having a great partiality for closing\nupon any loose end of Bathsheba's apparel which came within reach of\ntheir tongues.  Above each of these a still keener vision suggested a\nbrown forehead and two staring though not unfriendly eyes, and above\nall a pair of whitish crescent-shaped horns like two particularly\nnew moons, an occasional stolid \"moo!\" proclaiming beyond the shade\nof a doubt that these phenomena were the features and persons of\nDaisy, Whitefoot, Bonny-lass, Jolly-O, Spot, Twinkle-eye, etc.,\netc.--the respectable dairy of Devon cows belonging to Bathsheba\naforesaid.\n\nHer way back to the house was by a path through a young plantation of\ntapering firs, which had been planted some years earlier to shelter\nthe premises from the north wind.  By reason of the density of\nthe interwoven foliage overhead, it was gloomy there at cloudless\nnoontide, twilight in the evening, dark as midnight at dusk, and\nblack as the ninth plague of Egypt at midnight.  To describe the spot\nis to call it a vast, low, naturally formed hall, the plumy ceiling\nof which was supported by slender pillars of living wood, the floor\nbeing covered with a soft dun carpet of dead spikelets and mildewed\ncones, with a tuft of grass-blades here and there.\n\nThis bit of the path was always the crux of the night's ramble,\nthough, before starting, her apprehensions of danger were not vivid\nenough to lead her to take a companion.  Slipping along here covertly\nas Time, Bathsheba fancied she could hear footsteps entering the\ntrack at the opposite end.  It was certainly a rustle of footsteps.\nHer own instantly fell as gently as snowflakes.  She reassured\nherself by a remembrance that the path was public, and that the\ntraveller was probably some villager returning home; regretting,\nat the same time, that the meeting should be about to occur in the\ndarkest point of her route, even though only just outside her own\ndoor.\n\nThe noise approached, came close, and a figure was apparently on the\npoint of gliding past her when something tugged at her skirt and\npinned it forcibly to the ground.  The instantaneous check nearly\nthrew Bathsheba off her balance.  In recovering she struck against\nwarm clothes and buttons.\n\n\"A rum start, upon my soul!\" said a masculine voice, a foot or so\nabove her head.  \"Have I hurt you, mate?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Bathsheba, attempting to shrink away.\n\n\"We have got hitched together somehow, I think.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Are you a woman?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"A lady, I should have said.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter.\"\n\n\"I am a man.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\nBathsheba softly tugged again, but to no purpose.\n\n\"Is that a dark lantern you have?  I fancy so,\" said the man.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"If you'll allow me I'll open it, and set you free.\"\n\nA hand seized the lantern, the door was opened, the rays burst\nout from their prison, and Bathsheba beheld her position with\nastonishment.\n\nThe man to whom she was hooked was brilliant in brass and scarlet.\nHe was a soldier.  His sudden appearance was to darkness what the\nsound of a trumpet is to silence.  Gloom, the _genius loci_ at all\ntimes hitherto, was now totally overthrown, less by the lantern-light\nthan by what the lantern lighted.  The contrast of this revelation\nwith her anticipations of some sinister figure in sombre garb was so\ngreat that it had upon her the effect of a fairy transformation.\n\nIt was immediately apparent that the military man's spur had become\nentangled in the gimp which decorated the skirt of her dress.  He\ncaught a view of her face.\n\n\"I'll unfasten you in one moment, miss,\" he said, with new-born\ngallantry.\n\n\"Oh no--I can do it, thank you,\" she hastily replied, and stooped for\nthe performance.\n\nThe unfastening was not such a trifling affair.  The rowel of the\nspur had so wound itself among the gimp cords in those few moments,\nthat separation was likely to be a matter of time.\n\nHe too stooped, and the lantern standing on the ground betwixt them\nthrew the gleam from its open side among the fir-tree needles and the\nblades of long damp grass with the effect of a large glowworm.  It\nradiated upwards into their faces, and sent over half the plantation\ngigantic shadows of both man and woman, each dusky shape becoming\ndistorted and mangled upon the tree-trunks till it wasted to nothing.\n\nHe looked hard into her eyes when she raised them for a moment;\nBathsheba looked down again, for his gaze was too strong to be\nreceived point-blank with her own.  But she had obliquely noticed\nthat he was young and slim, and that he wore three chevrons upon his\nsleeve.\n\nBathsheba pulled again.\n\n\"You are a prisoner, miss; it is no use blinking the matter,\" said\nthe soldier, drily.  \"I must cut your dress if you are in such a\nhurry.\"\n\n\"Yes--please do!\" she exclaimed, helplessly.\n\n\"It wouldn't be necessary if you could wait a moment,\" and he unwound\na cord from the little wheel.  She withdrew her own hand, but,\nwhether by accident or design, he touched it.  Bathsheba was vexed;\nshe hardly knew why.\n\nHis unravelling went on, but it nevertheless seemed coming to no end.\nShe looked at him again.\n\n\"Thank you for the sight of such a beautiful face!\" said the young\nsergeant, without ceremony.\n\nShe coloured with embarrassment.  \"'Twas unwillingly shown,\" she\nreplied, stiffly, and with as much dignity--which was very little--as\nshe could infuse into a position of captivity.\n\n\"I like you the better for that incivility, miss,\" he said.\n\n\"I should have liked--I wish--you had never shown yourself to me by\nintruding here!\" She pulled again, and the gathers of her dress began\nto give way like liliputian musketry.\n\n\"I deserve the chastisement your words give me.  But why should such\na fair and dutiful girl have such an aversion to her father's sex?\"\n\n\"Go on your way, please.\"\n\n\"What, Beauty, and drag you after me?  Do but look; I never saw such\na tangle!\"\n\n\"Oh, 'tis shameful of you; you have been making it worse on purpose\nto keep me here--you have!\"\n\n\"Indeed, I don't think so,\" said the sergeant, with a merry twinkle.\n\n\"I tell you you have!\" she exclaimed, in high temper.  \"I insist upon\nundoing it.  Now, allow me!\"\n\n\"Certainly, miss; I am not of steel.\"  He added a sigh which had as\nmuch archness in it as a sigh could possess without losing its nature\naltogether.  \"I am thankful for beauty, even when 'tis thrown to me\nlike a bone to a dog.  These moments will be over too soon!\"\n\nShe closed her lips in a determined silence.\n\nBathsheba was revolving in her mind whether by a bold and desperate\nrush she could free herself at the risk of leaving her skirt bodily\nbehind her.  The thought was too dreadful.  The dress--which she had\nput on to appear stately at the supper--was the head and front of her\nwardrobe; not another in her stock became her so well.  What woman\nin Bathsheba's position, not naturally timid, and within call of her\nretainers, would have bought escape from a dashing soldier at so dear\na price?\n\n\"All in good time; it will soon be done, I perceive,\" said her cool\nfriend.\n\n\"This trifling provokes, and--and--\"\n\n\"Not too cruel!\"\n\n\"--Insults me!\"\n\n\"It is done in order that I may have the pleasure of apologizing to\nso charming a woman, which I straightway do most humbly, madam,\" he\nsaid, bowing low.\n\nBathsheba really knew not what to say.\n\n\"I've seen a good many women in my time,\" continued the young man in\na murmur, and more thoughtfully than hitherto, critically regarding\nher bent head at the same time; \"but I've never seen a woman so\nbeautiful as you.  Take it or leave it--be offended or like it--I\ndon't care.\"\n\n\"Who are you, then, who can so well afford to despise opinion?\"\n\n\"No stranger.  Sergeant Troy.  I am staying in this place.--There!\nit is undone at last, you see.  Your light fingers were more eager\nthan mine.  I wish it had been the knot of knots, which there's no\nuntying!\"\n\nThis was worse and worse.  She started up, and so did he.  How to\ndecently get away from him--that was her difficulty now.  She sidled\noff inch by inch, the lantern in her hand, till she could see the\nredness of his coat no longer.\n\n\"Ah, Beauty; good-bye!\" he said.\n\nShe made no reply, and, reaching a distance of twenty or thirty\nyards, turned about, and ran indoors.\n\nLiddy had just retired to rest.  In ascending to her own chamber,\nBathsheba opened the girl's door an inch or two, and, panting, said--\n\n\"Liddy, is any soldier staying in the village--sergeant somebody--\nrather gentlemanly for a sergeant, and good looking--a red coat with\nblue facings?\"\n\n\"No, miss ... No, I say; but really it might be Sergeant Troy home on\nfurlough, though I have not seen him.  He was here once in that way\nwhen the regiment was at Casterbridge.\"\n\n\"Yes; that's the name.  Had he a moustache--no whiskers or beard?\"\n\n\"He had.\"\n\n\"What kind of a person is he?\"\n\n\"Oh! miss--I blush to name it--a gay man!  But I know him to be very\nquick and trim, who might have made his thousands, like a squire.\nSuch a clever young dandy as he is!  He's a doctor's son by name,\nwhich is a great deal; and he's an earl's son by nature!\"\n\n\"Which is a great deal more.  Fancy!  Is it true?\"\n\n\"Yes.  And, he was brought up so well, and sent to Casterbridge\nGrammar School for years and years.  Learnt all languages while he\nwas there; and it was said he got on so far that he could take down\nChinese in shorthand; but that I don't answer for, as it was only\nreported.  However, he wasted his gifted lot, and listed a soldier;\nbut even then he rose to be a sergeant without trying at all.  Ah!\nsuch a blessing it is to be high-born; nobility of blood will shine\nout even in the ranks and files.  And is he really come home, miss?\"\n\n\"I believe so.  Good-night, Liddy.\"\n\nAfter all, how could a cheerful wearer of skirts be permanently\noffended with the man?  There are occasions when girls like Bathsheba\nwill put up with a great deal of unconventional behaviour.  When they\nwant to be praised, which is often, when they want to be mastered,\nwhich is sometimes; and when they want no nonsense, which is seldom.\nJust now the first feeling was in the ascendant with Bathsheba,\nwith a dash of the second.  Moreover, by chance or by devilry, the\nministrant was antecedently made interesting by being a handsome\nstranger who had evidently seen better days.\n\nSo she could not clearly decide whether it was her opinion that he\nhad insulted her or not.\n\n\"Was ever anything so odd!\" she at last exclaimed to herself, in her\nown room.  \"And was ever anything so meanly done as what I did--to\nskulk away like that from a man who was only civil and kind!\" Clearly\nshe did not think his barefaced praise of her person an insult now.\n\nIt was a fatal omission of Boldwood's that he had never once told her\nshe was beautiful.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\nTHE NEW ACQUAINTANCE DESCRIBED\n\n\nIdiosyncrasy and vicissitude had combined to stamp Sergeant Troy as\nan exceptional being.\n\nHe was a man to whom memories were an incumbrance, and anticipations\na superfluity.  Simply feeling, considering, and caring for what was\nbefore his eyes, he was vulnerable only in the present.  His outlook\nupon time was as a transient flash of the eye now and then: that\nprojection of consciousness into days gone by and to come, which\nmakes the past a synonym for the pathetic and the future a word\nfor circumspection, was foreign to Troy.  With him the past was\nyesterday; the future, to-morrow; never, the day after.\n\nOn this account he might, in certain lights, have been regarded as\none of the most fortunate of his order.  For it may be argued with\ngreat plausibility that reminiscence is less an endowment than a\ndisease, and that expectation in its only comfortable form--that of\nabsolute faith--is practically an impossibility; whilst in the form\nof hope and the secondary compounds, patience, impatience, resolve,\ncuriosity, it is a constant fluctuation between pleasure and pain.\n\nSergeant Troy, being entirely innocent of the practice of\nexpectation, was never disappointed.  To set against this negative\ngain there may have been some positive losses from a certain\nnarrowing of the higher tastes and sensations which it entailed.  But\nlimitation of the capacity is never recognized as a loss by the loser\ntherefrom: in this attribute moral or \u00c3\u00a6sthetic poverty contrasts\nplausibly with material, since those who suffer do not mind it,\nwhilst those who mind it soon cease to suffer.  It is not a denial\nof anything to have been always without it, and what Troy had never\nenjoyed he did not miss; but, being fully conscious that what sober\npeople missed he enjoyed, his capacity, though really less, seemed\ngreater than theirs.\n\nHe was moderately truthful towards men, but to women lied like\na Cretan--a system of ethics above all others calculated to win\npopularity at the first flush of admission into lively society; and\nthe possibility of the favour gained being transitory had reference\nonly to the future.\n\nHe never passed the line which divides the spruce vices from the\nugly; and hence, though his morals had hardly been applauded,\ndisapproval of them had frequently been tempered with a smile.  This\ntreatment had led to his becoming a sort of regrater of other men's\ngallantries, to his own aggrandizement as a Corinthian, rather than\nto the moral profit of his hearers.\n\nHis reason and his propensities had seldom any reciprocating\ninfluence, having separated by mutual consent long ago: thence it\nsometimes happened that, while his intentions were as honourable as\ncould be wished, any particular deed formed a dark background which\nthrew them into fine relief.  The sergeant's vicious phases being the\noffspring of impulse, and his virtuous phases of cool meditation, the\nlatter had a modest tendency to be oftener heard of than seen.\n\nTroy was full of activity, but his activities were less of a\nlocomotive than a vegetative nature; and, never being based upon\nany original choice of foundation or direction, they were exercised\non whatever object chance might place in their way.  Hence, whilst\nhe sometimes reached the brilliant in speech because that was\nspontaneous, he fell below the commonplace in action, from inability\nto guide incipient effort.  He had a quick comprehension and\nconsiderable force of character; but, being without the power to\ncombine them, the comprehension became engaged with trivialities\nwhilst waiting for the will to direct it, and the force wasted itself\nin useless grooves through unheeding the comprehension.\n\nHe was a fairly well-educated man for one of middle class--\nexceptionally well educated for a common soldier.  He spoke fluently\nand unceasingly.  He could in this way be one thing and seem another:\nfor instance, he could speak of love and think of dinner; call on the\nhusband to look at the wife; be eager to pay and intend to owe.\n\nThe wondrous power of flattery in _passados_ at woman is a perception\nso universal as to be remarked upon by many people almost as\nautomatically as they repeat a proverb, or say that they are\nChristians and the like, without thinking much of the enormous\ncorollaries which spring from the proposition.  Still less is it\nacted upon for the good of the complemental being alluded to.\nWith the majority such an opinion is shelved with all those trite\naphorisms which require some catastrophe to bring their tremendous\nmeanings thoroughly home.  When expressed with some amount of\nreflectiveness it seems co-ordinate with a belief that this flattery\nmust be reasonable to be effective.  It is to the credit of men that\nfew attempt to settle the question by experiment, and it is for\ntheir happiness, perhaps, that accident has never settled it for\nthem.  Nevertheless, that a male dissembler who by deluging her with\nuntenable fictions charms the female wisely, may acquire powers\nreaching to the extremity of perdition, is a truth taught to many by\nunsought and wringing occurrences.  And some profess to have attained\nto the same knowledge by experiment as aforesaid, and jauntily\ncontinue their indulgence in such experiments with terrible effect.\nSergeant Troy was one.\n\nHe had been known to observe casually that in dealing with womankind\nthe only alternative to flattery was cursing and swearing.  There was\nno third method.  \"Treat them fairly, and you are a lost man.\" he\nwould say.\n\nThis person's public appearance in Weatherbury promptly followed his\narrival there.  A week or two after the shearing, Bathsheba, feeling\na nameless relief of spirits on account of Boldwood's absence,\napproached her hayfields and looked over the hedge towards the\nhaymakers.  They consisted in about equal proportions of gnarled and\nflexuous forms, the former being the men, the latter the women, who\nwore tilt bonnets covered with nankeen, which hung in a curtain upon\ntheir shoulders.  Coggan and Mark Clark were mowing in a less forward\nmeadow, Clark humming a tune to the strokes of his scythe, to\nwhich Jan made no attempt to keep time with his.  In the first mead\nthey were already loading hay, the women raking it into cocks and\nwindrows, and the men tossing it upon the waggon.\n\nFrom behind the waggon a bright scarlet spot emerged, and went on\nloading unconcernedly with the rest.  It was the gallant sergeant,\nwho had come haymaking for pleasure; and nobody could deny that\nhe was doing the mistress of the farm real knight-service by this\nvoluntary contribution of his labour at a busy time.\n\nAs soon as she had entered the field Troy saw her, and sticking his\npitchfork into the ground and picking up his crop or cane, he came\nforward.  Bathsheba blushed with half-angry embarrassment, and\nadjusted her eyes as well as her feet to the direct line of her path.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\nSCENE ON THE VERGE OF THE HAY-MEAD\n\n\n\"Ah, Miss Everdene!\" said the sergeant, touching his diminutive cap.\n\"Little did I think it was you I was speaking to the other night.\nAnd yet, if I had reflected, the 'Queen of the Corn-market' (truth is\ntruth at any hour of the day or night, and I heard you so named in\nCasterbridge yesterday), the 'Queen of the Corn-market.' I say, could\nbe no other woman.  I step across now to beg your forgiveness a\nthousand times for having been led by my feelings to express myself\ntoo strongly for a stranger.  To be sure I am no stranger to the\nplace--I am Sergeant Troy, as I told you, and I have assisted your\nuncle in these fields no end of times when I was a lad.  I have been\ndoing the same for you to-day.\"\n\n\"I suppose I must thank you for that, Sergeant Troy,\" said the Queen\nof the Corn-market, in an indifferently grateful tone.\n\nThe sergeant looked hurt and sad.  \"Indeed you must not, Miss\nEverdene,\" he said.  \"Why could you think such a thing necessary?\"\n\n\"I am glad it is not.\"\n\n\"Why? if I may ask without offence.\"\n\n\"Because I don't much want to thank you for anything.\"\n\n\"I am afraid I have made a hole with my tongue that my heart will\nnever mend.  O these intolerable times: that ill-luck should follow\na man for honestly telling a woman she is beautiful!  'Twas the most\nI said--you must own that; and the least I could say--that I own\nmyself.\"\n\n\"There is some talk I could do without more easily than money.\"\n\n\"Indeed.  That remark is a sort of digression.\"\n\n\"No.  It means that I would rather have your room than your company.\"\n\n\"And I would rather have curses from you than kisses from any other\nwoman; so I'll stay here.\"\n\nBathsheba was absolutely speechless.  And yet she could not help\nfeeling that the assistance he was rendering forbade a harsh repulse.\n\n\"Well,\" continued Troy, \"I suppose there is a praise which is\nrudeness, and that may be mine.  At the same time there is a\ntreatment which is injustice, and that may be yours.  Because a plain\nblunt man, who has never been taught concealment, speaks out his mind\nwithout exactly intending it, he's to be snapped off like the son of\na sinner.\"\n\n\"Indeed there's no such case between us,\" she said, turning away.  \"I\ndon't allow strangers to be bold and impudent--even in praise of me.\"\n\n\"Ah--it is not the fact but the method which offends you,\" he said,\ncarelessly.  \"But I have the sad satisfaction of knowing that my\nwords, whether pleasing or offensive, are unmistakably true.  Would\nyou have had me look at you, and tell my acquaintance that you are\nquite a common-place woman, to save you the embarrassment of being\nstared at if they come near you?  Not I.  I couldn't tell any such\nridiculous lie about a beauty to encourage a single woman in England\nin too excessive a modesty.\"\n\n\"It is all pretence--what you are saying!\" exclaimed Bathsheba,\nlaughing in spite of herself at the sly method.  \"You have a rare\ninvention, Sergeant Troy.  Why couldn't you have passed by me that\nnight, and said nothing?--that was all I meant to reproach you for.\"\n\n\"Because I wasn't going to.  Half the pleasure of a feeling lies in\nbeing able to express it on the spur of the moment, and I let out\nmine.  It would have been just the same if you had been the reverse\nperson--ugly and old--I should have exclaimed about it in the same\nway.\"\n\n\"How long is it since you have been so afflicted with strong feeling,\nthen?\"\n\n\"Oh, ever since I was big enough to know loveliness from deformity.\"\n\n\"'Tis to be hoped your sense of the difference you speak of doesn't\nstop at faces, but extends to morals as well.\"\n\n\"I won't speak of morals or religion--my own or anybody else's.\nThough perhaps I should have been a very good Christian if you pretty\nwomen hadn't made me an idolater.\"\n\nBathsheba moved on to hide the irrepressible dimplings of merriment.\nTroy followed, whirling his crop.\n\n\"But--Miss Everdene--you do forgive me?\"\n\n\"Hardly.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"You say such things.\"\n\n\"I said you were beautiful, and I'll say so still; for, by G---- so you\nare!  The most beautiful ever I saw, or may I fall dead this instant!\nWhy, upon my ----\"\n\n\"Don't--don't!  I won't listen to you--you are so profane!\" she said,\nin a restless state between distress at hearing him and a _penchant_\nto hear more.\n\n\"I again say you are a most fascinating woman.  There's nothing\nremarkable in my saying so, is there?  I'm sure the fact is evident\nenough.  Miss Everdene, my opinion may be too forcibly let out\nto please you, and, for the matter of that, too insignificant to\nconvince you, but surely it is honest, and why can't it be excused?\"\n\n\"Because it--it isn't a correct one,\" she femininely murmured.\n\n\"Oh, fie--fie!  Am I any worse for breaking the third of that\nTerrible Ten than you for breaking the ninth?\"\n\n\"Well, it doesn't seem QUITE true to me that I am fascinating,\" she\nreplied evasively.\n\n\"Not so to you: then I say with all respect that, if so, it is owing\nto your modesty, Miss Everdene.  But surely you must have been told\nby everybody of what everybody notices?  And you should take their\nwords for it.\"\n\n\"They don't say so exactly.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, they must!\"\n\n\"Well, I mean to my face, as you do,\" she went on, allowing herself\nto be further lured into a conversation that intention had rigorously\nforbidden.\n\n\"But you know they think so?\"\n\n\"No--that is--I certainly have heard Liddy say they do, but--\"  She\npaused.\n\nCapitulation--that was the purport of the simple reply, guarded as it\nwas--capitulation, unknown to herself.  Never did a fragile tailless\nsentence convey a more perfect meaning.  The careless sergeant smiled\nwithin himself, and probably too the devil smiled from a loop-hole in\nTophet, for the moment was the turning-point of a career.  Her tone\nand mien signified beyond mistake that the seed which was to lift the\nfoundation had taken root in the chink: the remainder was a mere\nquestion of time and natural changes.\n\n\"There the truth comes out!\" said the soldier, in reply.  \"Never tell\nme that a young lady can live in a buzz of admiration without knowing\nsomething about it.  Ah, well, Miss Everdene, you are--pardon my\nblunt way--you are rather an injury to our race than otherwise.\"\n\n\"How--indeed?\" she said, opening her eyes.\n\n\"Oh, it is true enough.  I may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb\n(an old country saying, not of much account, but it will do for a\nrough soldier), and so I will speak my mind, regardless of your\npleasure, and without hoping or intending to get your pardon.  Why,\nMiss Everdene, it is in this manner that your good looks may do more\nharm than good in the world.\"  The sergeant looked down the mead in\ncritical abstraction.  \"Probably some one man on an average falls in\nlove with each ordinary woman.  She can marry him: he is content,\nand leads a useful life.  Such women as you a hundred men always\ncovet--your eyes will bewitch scores on scores into an unavailing\nfancy for you--you can only marry one of that many.  Out of these\nsay twenty will endeavour to drown the bitterness of despised love\nin drink; twenty more will mope away their lives without a wish or\nattempt to make a mark in the world, because they have no ambition\napart from their attachment to you; twenty more--the susceptible\nperson myself possibly among them--will be always draggling after\nyou, getting where they may just see you, doing desperate things.\nMen are such constant fools!  The rest may try to get over their\npassion with more or less success.  But all these men will be\nsaddened.  And not only those ninety-nine men, but the ninety-nine\nwomen they might have married are saddened with them.  There's my\ntale.  That's why I say that a woman so charming as yourself, Miss\nEverdene, is hardly a blessing to her race.\"\n\nThe handsome sergeant's features were during this speech as rigid and\nstern as John Knox's in addressing his gay young queen.\n\nSeeing she made no reply, he said, \"Do you read French?\"\n\n\"No; I began, but when I got to the verbs, father died,\" she said\nsimply.\n\n\"I do--when I have an opportunity, which latterly has not been often\n(my mother was a Parisienne)--and there's a proverb they have,\n_Qui aime bien, ch\u00c3\u00a2tie bien_--'He chastens who loves well.'  Do you\nunderstand me?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" she replied, and there was even a little tremulousness in the\nusually cool girl's voice; \"if you can only fight half as winningly\nas you can talk, you are able to make a pleasure of a bayonet wound!\"\nAnd then poor Bathsheba instantly perceived her slip in making this\nadmission: in hastily trying to retrieve it, she went from bad to\nworse.  \"Don't, however, suppose that _I_ derive any pleasure from\nwhat you tell me.\"\n\n\"I know you do not--I know it perfectly,\" said Troy, with much hearty\nconviction on the exterior of his face: and altering the expression\nto moodiness; \"when a dozen men are ready to speak tenderly to you,\nand give the admiration you deserve without adding the warning you\nneed, it stands to reason that my poor rough-and-ready mixture of\npraise and blame cannot convey much pleasure.  Fool as I may be, I\nam not so conceited as to suppose that!\"\n\n\"I think you--are conceited, nevertheless,\" said Bathsheba, looking\naskance at a reed she was fitfully pulling with one hand, having\nlately grown feverish under the soldier's system of procedure--not\nbecause the nature of his cajolery was entirely unperceived, but\nbecause its vigour was overwhelming.\n\n\"I would not own it to anybody else--nor do I exactly to you.  Still,\nthere might have been some self-conceit in my foolish supposition\nthe other night.  I knew that what I said in admiration might be\nan opinion too often forced upon you to give any pleasure, but I\ncertainly did think that the kindness of your nature might prevent\nyou judging an uncontrolled tongue harshly--which you have done--and\nthinking badly of me and wounding me this morning, when I am working\nhard to save your hay.\"\n\n\"Well, you need not think more of that: perhaps you did not mean to\nbe rude to me by speaking out your mind: indeed, I believe you did\nnot,\" said the shrewd woman, in painfully innocent earnest.  \"And I\nthank you for giving help here.  But--but mind you don't speak to me\nagain in that way, or in any other, unless I speak to you.\"\n\n\"Oh, Miss Bathsheba!  That is too hard!\"\n\n\"No, it isn't.  Why is it?\"\n\n\"You will never speak to me; for I shall not be here long.  I am soon\ngoing back again to the miserable monotony of drill--and perhaps\nour regiment will be ordered out soon.  And yet you take away the\none little ewe-lamb of pleasure that I have in this dull life\nof mine. Well, perhaps generosity is not a woman's most marked\ncharacteristic.\"\n\n\"When are you going from here?\" she asked, with some interest.\n\n\"In a month.\"\n\n\"But how can it give you pleasure to speak to me?\"\n\n\"Can you ask Miss Everdene--knowing as you do--what my offence is\nbased on?\"\n\n\"If you do care so much for a silly trifle of that kind, then, I\ndon't mind doing it,\" she uncertainly and doubtingly answered.  \"But\nyou can't really care for a word from me? you only say so--I think\nyou only say so.\"\n\n\"That's unjust--but I won't repeat the remark.  I am too gratified to\nget such a mark of your friendship at any price to cavil at the tone.\nI DO, Miss Everdene, care for it.  You may think a man foolish to\nwant a mere word--just a good morning.  Perhaps he is--I don't know.\nBut you have never been a man looking upon a woman, and that woman\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Well.\"\n\n\"Then you know nothing of what such an experience is like--and Heaven\nforbid that you ever should!\"\n\n\"Nonsense, flatterer!  What is it like?  I am interested in knowing.\"\n\n\"Put shortly, it is not being able to think, hear, or look in\nany direction except one without wretchedness, nor there without\ntorture.\"\n\n\"Ah, sergeant, it won't do--you are pretending!\" she said, shaking\nher head. \"Your words are too dashing to be true.\"\n\n\"I am not, upon the honour of a soldier.\"\n\n\"But WHY is it so?--Of course I ask for mere pastime.\"\n\n\"Because you are so distracting--and I am so distracted.\"\n\n\"You look like it.\"\n\n\"I am indeed.\"\n\n\"Why, you only saw me the other night!\"\n\n\"That makes no difference.  The lightning works instantaneously.  I\nloved you then, at once--as I do now.\"\n\nBathsheba surveyed him curiously, from the feet upward, as high as\nshe liked to venture her glance, which was not quite so high as his\neyes.\n\n\"You cannot and you don't,\" she said demurely.  \"There is no such\nsudden feeling in people.  I won't listen to you any longer.  Hear\nme, I wish I knew what o'clock it is--I am going--I have wasted too\nmuch time here already!\"\n\nThe sergeant looked at his watch and told her.  \"What, haven't you a\nwatch, miss?\" he inquired.\n\n\"I have not just at present--I am about to get a new one.\"\n\n\"No.  You shall be given one.  Yes--you shall.  A gift, Miss\nEverdene--a gift.\"\n\nAnd before she knew what the young man was intending, a heavy gold\nwatch was in her hand.\n\n\"It is an unusually good one for a man like me to possess,\" he\nquietly said.  \"That watch has a history.  Press the spring and open\nthe back.\"\n\nShe did so.\n\n\"What do you see?\"\n\n\"A crest and a motto.\"\n\n\"A coronet with five points, and beneath, _Cedit amor rebus_--'Love\nyields to circumstance.' It's the motto of the Earls of Severn.\nThat watch belonged to the last lord, and was given to my mother's\nhusband, a medical man, for his use till I came of age, when it was\nto be given to me.  It was all the fortune that ever I inherited.\nThat watch has regulated imperial interests in its time--the stately\nceremonial, the courtly assignation, pompous travels, and lordly\nsleeps.  Now it is yours.\"\n\n\"But, Sergeant Troy, I cannot take this--I cannot!\" she exclaimed,\nwith round-eyed wonder.  \"A gold watch!  What are you doing?  Don't\nbe such a dissembler!\"\n\nThe sergeant retreated to avoid receiving back his gift, which she\nheld out persistently towards him.  Bathsheba followed as he retired.\n\n\"Keep it--do, Miss Everdene--keep it!\" said the erratic child of\nimpulse.  \"The fact of your possessing it makes it worth ten times\nas much to me.  A more plebeian one will answer my purpose just\nas well, and the pleasure of knowing whose heart my old one beats\nagainst--well, I won't speak of that.  It is in far worthier hands\nthan ever it has been in before.\"\n\n\"But indeed I can't have it!\" she said, in a perfect simmer of\ndistress.  \"Oh, how can you do such a thing; that is if you really\nmean it!  Give me your dead father's watch, and such a valuable one!\nYou should not be so reckless, indeed, Sergeant Troy!\"\n\n\"I loved my father: good; but better, I love you more.  That's how I\ncan do it,\" said the sergeant, with an intonation of such exquisite\nfidelity to nature that it was evidently not all acted now.  Her\nbeauty, which, whilst it had been quiescent, he had praised in jest,\nhad in its animated phases moved him to earnest; and though his\nseriousness was less than she imagined, it was probably more than he\nimagined himself.\n\nBathsheba was brimming with agitated bewilderment, and she said, in\nhalf-suspicious accents of feeling, \"Can it be!  Oh, how can it be,\nthat you care for me, and so suddenly!  You have seen so little\nof me: I may not be really so--so nice-looking as I seem to you.\nPlease, do take it; Oh, do!  I cannot and will not have it.  Believe\nme, your generosity is too great.  I have never done you a single\nkindness, and why should you be so kind to me?\"\n\nA factitious reply had been again upon his lips, but it was again\nsuspended, and he looked at her with an arrested eye.  The truth was,\nthat as she now stood--excited, wild, and honest as the day--her\nalluring beauty bore out so fully the epithets he had bestowed upon\nit that he was quite startled at his temerity in advancing them as\nfalse.  He said mechanically, \"Ah, why?\" and continued to look at\nher.\n\n\"And my workfolk see me following you about the field, and are\nwondering.  Oh, this is dreadful!\" she went on, unconscious of the\ntransmutation she was effecting.\n\n\"I did not quite mean you to accept it at first, for it was my one\npoor patent of nobility,\" he broke out, bluntly; \"but, upon my soul,\nI wish you would now.  Without any shamming, come!  Don't deny me the\nhappiness of wearing it for my sake?  But you are too lovely even to\ncare to be kind as others are.\"\n\n\"No, no; don't say so!  I have reasons for reserve which I cannot\nexplain.\"\n\n\"Let it be, then, let it be,\" he said, receiving back the watch at\nlast; \"I must be leaving you now.  And will you speak to me for these\nfew weeks of my stay?\"\n\n\"Indeed I will.  Yet, I don't know if I will!  Oh, why did you come\nand disturb me so!\"\n\n\"Perhaps in setting a gin, I have caught myself.  Such things have\nhappened.  Well, will you let me work in your fields?\" he coaxed.\n\n\"Yes, I suppose so; if it is any pleasure to you.\"\n\n\"Miss Everdene, I thank you.\"\n\n\"No, no.\"\n\n\"Good-bye!\"\n\nThe sergeant brought his hand to the cap on the slope of his head,\nsaluted, and returned to the distant group of haymakers.\n\nBathsheba could not face the haymakers now.  Her heart erratically\nflitting hither and thither from perplexed excitement, hot, and\nalmost tearful, she retreated homeward, murmuring, \"Oh, what have I\ndone!  What does it mean!  I wish I knew how much of it was true!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\nHIVING THE BEES\n\n\nThe Weatherbury bees were late in their swarming this year. It was in\nthe latter part of June, and the day after the interview with Troy in\nthe hayfield, that Bathsheba was standing in her garden, watching a\nswarm in the air and guessing their probable settling place.  Not\nonly were they late this year, but unruly.  Sometimes throughout a\nwhole season all the swarms would alight on the lowest attainable\nbough--such as part of a currant-bush or espalier apple-tree; next\nyear they would, with just the same unanimity, make straight off to\nthe uppermost member of some tall, gaunt costard, or quarrenden,\nand there defy all invaders who did not come armed with ladders and\nstaves to take them.\n\nThis was the case at present.  Bathsheba's eyes, shaded by one hand,\nwere following the ascending multitude against the unexplorable\nstretch of blue till they ultimately halted by one of the unwieldy\ntrees spoken of.  A process somewhat analogous to that of alleged\nformations of the universe, time and times ago, was observable.  The\nbustling swarm had swept the sky in a scattered and uniform haze,\nwhich now thickened to a nebulous centre: this glided on to a bough\nand grew still denser, till it formed a solid black spot upon the\nlight.\n\nThe men and women being all busily engaged in saving the hay--even\nLiddy had left the house for the purpose of lending a hand--Bathsheba\nresolved to hive the bees herself, if possible.  She had dressed the\nhive with herbs and honey, fetched a ladder, brush, and crook, made\nherself impregnable with armour of leather gloves, straw hat, and\nlarge gauze veil--once green but now faded to snuff colour--and\nascended a dozen rungs of the ladder.  At once she heard, not ten\nyards off, a voice that was beginning to have a strange power in\nagitating her.\n\n\"Miss Everdene, let me assist you; you should not attempt such a\nthing alone.\"\n\nTroy was just opening the garden gate.\n\nBathsheba flung down the brush, crook, and empty hive, pulled the\nskirt of her dress tightly round her ankles in a tremendous flurry,\nand as well as she could slid down the ladder.  By the time she\nreached the bottom Troy was there also, and he stooped to pick up\nthe hive.\n\n\"How fortunate I am to have dropped in at this moment!\" exclaimed the\nsergeant.\n\nShe found her voice in a minute.  \"What! and will you shake them in\nfor me?\" she asked, in what, for a defiant girl, was a faltering way;\nthough, for a timid girl, it would have seemed a brave way enough.\n\n\"Will I!\" said Troy.  \"Why, of course I will.  How blooming you are\nto-day!\"  Troy flung down his cane and put his foot on the ladder to\nascend.\n\n\"But you must have on the veil and gloves, or you'll be stung\nfearfully!\"\n\n\"Ah, yes.  I must put on the veil and gloves.  Will you kindly show\nme how to fix them properly?\"\n\n\"And you must have the broad-brimmed hat, too, for your cap has no\nbrim to keep the veil off, and they'd reach your face.\"\n\n\"The broad-brimmed hat, too, by all means.\"\n\nSo a whimsical fate ordered that her hat should be taken off--veil\nand all attached--and placed upon his head, Troy tossing his own into\na gooseberry bush.  Then the veil had to be tied at its lower edge\nround his collar and the gloves put on him.\n\nHe looked such an extraordinary object in this guise that, flurried\nas she was, she could not avoid laughing outright. It was the removal\nof yet another stake from the palisade of cold manners which had kept\nhim off.\n\nBathsheba looked on from the ground whilst he was busy sweeping and\nshaking the bees from the tree, holding up the hive with the other\nhand for them to fall into.  She made use of an unobserved minute\nwhilst his attention was absorbed in the operation to arrange her\nplumes a little.  He came down holding the hive at arm's length,\nbehind which trailed a cloud of bees.\n\n\"Upon my life,\" said Troy, through the veil, \"holding up this hive\nmakes one's arm ache worse than a week of sword-exercise.\" When the\nmanoeuvre was complete he approached her.  \"Would you be good enough\nto untie me and let me out? I am nearly stifled inside this silk\ncage.\"\n\nTo hide her embarrassment during the unwonted process of untying the\nstring about his neck, she said:--\n\n\"I have never seen that you spoke of.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The sword-exercise.\"\n\n\"Ah! would you like to?\" said Troy.\n\nBathsheba hesitated.  She had heard wondrous reports from time to\ntime by dwellers in Weatherbury, who had by chance sojourned awhile\nin Casterbridge, near the barracks, of this strange and glorious\nperformance, the sword-exercise.  Men and boys who had peeped through\nchinks or over walls into the barrack-yard returned with accounts of\nits being the most flashing affair conceivable; accoutrements and\nweapons glistening like stars--here, there, around--yet all by rule\nand compass.  So she said mildly what she felt strongly.\n\n\"Yes; I should like to see it very much.\"\n\n\"And so you shall; you shall see me go through it.\"\n\n\"No!  How?\"\n\n\"Let me consider.\"\n\n\"Not with a walking-stick--I don't care to see that.  It must be a\nreal sword.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know; and I have no sword here; but I think I could get one\nby the evening.  Now, will you do this?\"\n\nTroy bent over her and murmured some suggestion in a low voice.\n\n\"Oh no, indeed!\" said Bathsheba, blushing. \"Thank you very much, but\nI couldn't on any account.\"\n\n\"Surely you might?  Nobody would know.\"\n\nShe shook her head, but with a weakened negation.  \"If I were to,\"\nshe said, \"I must bring Liddy too.  Might I not?\"\n\nTroy looked far away.  \"I don't see why you want to bring her,\" he\nsaid coldly.\n\nAn unconscious look of assent in Bathsheba's eyes betrayed that\nsomething more than his coldness had made her also feel that Liddy\nwould be superfluous in the suggested scene.  She had felt it, even\nwhilst making the proposal.\n\n\"Well, I won't bring Liddy--and I'll come.  But only for a very short\ntime,\" she added; \"a very short time.\"\n\n\"It will not take five minutes,\" said Troy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\nTHE HOLLOW AMID THE FERNS\n\n\nThe hill opposite Bathsheba's dwelling extended, a mile off, into an\nuncultivated tract of land, dotted at this season with tall thickets\nof brake fern, plump and diaphanous from recent rapid growth, and\nradiant in hues of clear and untainted green.\n\nAt eight o'clock this midsummer evening, whilst the bristling ball\nof gold in the west still swept the tips of the ferns with its long,\nluxuriant rays, a soft brushing-by of garments might have been heard\namong them, and Bathsheba appeared in their midst, their soft,\nfeathery arms caressing her up to her shoulders.  She paused, turned,\nwent back over the hill and half-way to her own door, whence she cast\na farewell glance upon the spot she had just left, having resolved\nnot to remain near the place after all.\n\nShe saw a dim spot of artificial red moving round the shoulder of the\nrise.  It disappeared on the other side.\n\nShe waited one minute--two minutes--thought of Troy's disappointment\nat her non-fulfilment of a promised engagement, till she again ran\nalong the field, clambered over the bank, and followed the original\ndirection.  She was now literally trembling and panting at this her\ntemerity in such an errant undertaking; her breath came and went\nquickly, and her eyes shone with an infrequent light.  Yet go she\nmust.  She reached the verge of a pit in the middle of the ferns.\nTroy stood in the bottom, looking up towards her.\n\n\"I heard you rustling through the fern before I saw you,\" he said,\ncoming up and giving her his hand to help her down the slope.\n\nThe pit was a saucer-shaped concave, naturally formed, with a top\ndiameter of about thirty feet, and shallow enough to allow the\nsunshine to reach their heads.  Standing in the centre, the sky\noverhead was met by a circular horizon of fern: this grew nearly to\nthe bottom of the slope and then abruptly ceased.  The middle within\nthe belt of verdure was floored with a thick flossy carpet of moss\nand grass intermingled, so yielding that the foot was half-buried\nwithin it.\n\n\"Now,\" said Troy, producing the sword, which, as he raised it into\nthe sunlight, gleamed a sort of greeting, like a living thing,\n\"first, we have four right and four left cuts; four right and four\nleft thrusts.   Infantry cuts and guards are more interesting than\nours, to my mind; but they are not so swashing.  They have seven\ncuts and three thrusts.   So much as a preliminary.  Well, next, our\ncut one is as if you were sowing your corn--so.\"  Bathsheba saw a\nsort of rainbow, upside down in the air, and Troy's arm was still\nagain.  \"Cut two, as if you were hedging--so.  Three, as if you were\nreaping--so. Four, as if you were threshing--in that way.  Then the\nsame on the left.  The thrusts are these: one, two, three, four,\nright; one, two, three, four, left.\"  He repeated them.  \"Have 'em\nagain?\" he said.  \"One, two--\"\n\nShe hurriedly interrupted: \"I'd rather not; though I don't mind your\ntwos and fours; but your ones and threes are terrible!\"\n\n\"Very well.  I'll let you off the ones and threes.  Next, cuts,\npoints and guards altogether.\"  Troy duly exhibited them.  \"Then\nthere's pursuing practice, in this way.\"  He gave the movements as\nbefore.   \"There, those are the stereotyped forms.  The infantry have\ntwo most diabolical upward cuts, which we are too humane to use.\nLike this--three, four.\"\n\n\"How murderous and bloodthirsty!\"\n\n\"They are rather deathly.  Now I'll be more interesting, and let you\nsee some loose play--giving all the cuts and points, infantry and\ncavalry, quicker than lightning, and as promiscuously--with just\nenough rule to regulate instinct and yet not to fetter it.  You are\nmy antagonist, with this difference from real warfare, that I shall\nmiss you every time by one hair's breadth, or perhaps two.  Mind you\ndon't flinch, whatever you do.\"\n\n\"I'll be sure not to!\" she said invincibly.\n\nHe pointed to about a yard in front of him.\n\nBathsheba's adventurous spirit was beginning to find some grains of\nrelish in these highly novel proceedings.  She took up her position\nas directed, facing Troy.\n\n\"Now just to learn whether you have pluck enough to let me do what I\nwish, I'll give you a preliminary test.\"\n\nHe flourished the sword by way of introduction number two, and the\nnext thing of which she was conscious was that the point and blade of\nthe sword were darting with a gleam towards her left side, just above\nher hip; then of their reappearance on her right side, emerging as\nit were from between her ribs, having apparently passed through her\nbody.  The third item of consciousness was that of seeing the same\nsword, perfectly clean and free from blood held vertically in Troy's\nhand (in the position technically called \"recover swords\").  All was\nas quick as electricity.\n\n\"Oh!\" she cried out in affright, pressing her hand to her side. \"Have\nyou run me through?--no, you have not!  Whatever have you done!\"\n\n\"I have not touched you,\" said Troy, quietly.  \"It was mere sleight\nof hand.  The sword passed behind you.  Now you are not afraid, are\nyou?  Because if you are I can't perform.  I give my word that I will\nnot only not hurt you, but not once touch you.\"\n\n\"I don't think I am afraid.  You are quite sure you will not hurt\nme?\"\n\n\"Quite sure.\"\n\n\"Is the sword very sharp?\"\n\n\"O no--only stand as still as a statue.  Now!\"\n\nIn an instant the atmosphere was transformed to Bathsheba's eyes.\nBeams of light caught from the low sun's rays, above, around, in\nfront of her, well-nigh shut out earth and heaven--all emitted in\nthe marvellous evolutions of Troy's reflecting blade, which seemed\neverywhere at once, and yet nowhere specially.  These circling gleams\nwere accompanied by a keen rush that was almost a whistling--also\nspringing from all sides of her at once.  In short, she was enclosed\nin a firmament of light, and of sharp hisses, resembling a sky-full\nof meteors close at hand.\n\nNever since the broadsword became the national weapon had there been\nmore dexterity shown in its management than by the hands of Sergeant\nTroy, and never had he been in such splendid temper for the\nperformance as now in the evening sunshine among the ferns with\nBathsheba.  It may safely be asserted with respect to the closeness\nof his cuts, that had it been possible for the edge of the sword to\nleave in the air a permanent substance wherever it flew past, the\nspace left untouched would have been almost a mould of Bathsheba's\nfigure.\n\nBehind the luminous streams of this _aurora militaris_, she could see\nthe hue of Troy's sword arm, spread in a scarlet haze over the space\ncovered by its motions, like a twanged harpstring, and behind all\nTroy himself, mostly facing her; sometimes, to show the rear cuts,\nhalf turned away, his eye nevertheless always keenly measuring\nher breadth and outline, and his lips tightly closed in sustained\neffort.  Next, his movements lapsed slower, and she could see them\nindividually.  The hissing of the sword had ceased, and he stopped\nentirely.\n\n\"That outer loose lock of hair wants tidying,\" he said, before she\nhad moved or spoken.  \"Wait: I'll do it for you.\"\n\nAn arc of silver shone on her right side: the sword had descended.\nThe lock dropped to the ground.\n\n\"Bravely borne!\" said Troy.  \"You didn't flinch a shade's thickness.\nWonderful in a woman!\"\n\n\"It was because I didn't expect it.  Oh, you have spoilt my hair!\"\n\n\"Only once more.\"\n\n\"No--no!  I am afraid of you--indeed I am!\" she cried.\n\n\"I won't touch you at all--not even your hair.  I am only going to\nkill that caterpillar settling on you.  Now: still!\"\n\nIt appeared that a caterpillar had come from the fern and chosen the\nfront of her bodice as his resting place.  She saw the point glisten\ntowards her bosom, and seemingly enter it.  Bathsheba closed her eyes\nin the full persuasion that she was killed at last.  However, feeling\njust as usual, she opened them again.\n\n\"There it is, look,\" said the sergeant, holding his sword before her\neyes.\n\nThe caterpillar was spitted upon its point.\n\n\"Why, it is magic!\" said Bathsheba, amazed.\n\n\"Oh no--dexterity.  I merely gave point to your bosom where the\ncaterpillar was, and instead of running you through checked the\nextension a thousandth of an inch short of your surface.\"\n\n\"But how could you chop off a curl of my hair with a sword that has\nno edge?\"\n\n\"No edge!  This sword will shave like a razor.  Look here.\"\n\nHe touched the palm of his hand with the blade, and then, lifting it,\nshowed her a thin shaving of scarf-skin dangling therefrom.\n\n\"But you said before beginning that it was blunt and couldn't cut\nme!\"\n\n\"That was to get you to stand still, and so make sure of your safety.\nThe risk of injuring you through your moving was too great not to\nforce me to tell you a fib to escape it.\"\n\nShe shuddered.  \"I have been within an inch of my life, and didn't\nknow it!\"\n\n\"More precisely speaking, you have been within half an inch of being\npared alive two hundred and ninety-five times.\"\n\n\"Cruel, cruel, 'tis of you!\"\n\n\"You have been perfectly safe, nevertheless.  My sword never errs.\"\nAnd Troy returned the weapon to the scabbard.\n\nBathsheba, overcome by a hundred tumultuous feelings resulting from\nthe scene, abstractedly sat down on a tuft of heather.\n\n\"I must leave you now,\" said Troy, softly.  \"And I'll venture to take\nand keep this in remembrance of you.\"\n\nShe saw him stoop to the grass, pick up the winding lock which he\nhad severed from her manifold tresses, twist it round his fingers,\nunfasten a button in the breast of his coat, and carefully put\nit inside.  She felt powerless to withstand or deny him.  He was\naltogether too much for her, and Bathsheba seemed as one who, facing\na reviving wind, finds it blow so strongly that it stops the breath.\nHe drew near and said, \"I must be leaving you.\"\n\nHe drew nearer still.  A minute later and she saw his scarlet form\ndisappear amid the ferny thicket, almost in a flash, like a brand\nswiftly waved.\n\nThat minute's interval had brought the blood beating into her face,\nset her stinging as if aflame to the very hollows of her feet, and\nenlarged emotion to a compass which quite swamped thought.  It had\nbrought upon her a stroke resulting, as did that of Moses in Horeb,\nin a liquid stream--here a stream of tears.  She felt like one who\nhas sinned a great sin.\n\nThe circumstance had been the gentle dip of Troy's mouth downwards\nupon her own.  He had kissed her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\nPARTICULARS OF A TWILIGHT WALK\n\n\nWe now see the element of folly distinctly mingling with the many\nvarying particulars which made up the character of Bathsheba\nEverdene.  It was almost foreign to her intrinsic nature.  Introduced\nas lymph on the dart of Eros, it eventually permeated and coloured\nher whole constitution.  Bathsheba, though she had too much\nunderstanding to be entirely governed by her womanliness, had too\nmuch womanliness to use her understanding to the best advantage.\nPerhaps in no minor point does woman astonish her helpmate more than\nin the strange power she possesses of believing cajoleries that she\nknows to be false--except, indeed, in that of being utterly sceptical\non strictures that she knows to be true.\n\nBathsheba loved Troy in the way that only self-reliant women\nlove when they abandon their self-reliance.  When a strong woman\nrecklessly throws away her strength she is worse than a weak woman\nwho has never had any strength to throw away.  One source of her\ninadequacy is the novelty of the occasion. She has never had practice\nin making the best of such a condition.  Weakness is doubly weak by\nbeing new.\n\nBathsheba was not conscious of guile in this matter.  Though in one\nsense a woman of the world, it was, after all, that world of daylight\ncoteries and green carpets wherein cattle form the passing crowd and\nwinds the busy hum; where a quiet family of rabbits or hares lives on\nthe other side of your party-wall, where your neighbour is everybody\nin the tything, and where calculation is confined to market-days.\nOf the fabricated tastes of good fashionable society she knew but\nlittle, and of the formulated self-indulgence of bad, nothing at all.\nHad her utmost thoughts in this direction been distinctly worded (and\nby herself they never were), they would only have amounted to such a\nmatter as that she felt her impulses to be pleasanter guides than her\ndiscretion.  Her love was entire as a child's, and though warm as\nsummer it was fresh as spring.  Her culpability lay in her making\nno attempt to control feeling by subtle and careful inquiry into\nconsequences.  She could show others the steep and thorny way, but\n\"reck'd not her own rede.\"\n\nAnd Troy's deformities lay deep down from a woman's vision, whilst\nhis embellishments were upon the very surface; thus contrasting with\nhomely Oak, whose defects were patent to the blindest, and whose\nvirtues were as metals in a mine.\n\nThe difference between love and respect was markedly shown in her\nconduct.  Bathsheba had spoken of her interest in Boldwood with the\ngreatest freedom to Liddy, but she had only communed with her own\nheart concerning Troy.\n\nAll this infatuation Gabriel saw, and was troubled thereby from the\ntime of his daily journey a-field to the time of his return, and on\nto the small hours of many a night.  That he was not beloved had\nhitherto been his great sorrow; that Bathsheba was getting into\nthe toils was now a sorrow greater than the first, and one which\nnearly obscured it.  It was a result which paralleled the oft-quoted\nobservation of Hippocrates concerning physical pains.\n\nThat is a noble though perhaps an unpromising love which not even the\nfear of breeding aversion in the bosom of the one beloved can deter\nfrom combating his or her errors.  Oak determined to speak to his\nmistress.  He would base his appeal on what he considered her unfair\ntreatment of Farmer Boldwood, now absent from home.\n\nAn opportunity occurred one evening when she had gone for a short\nwalk by a path through the neighbouring cornfields.  It was dusk when\nOak, who had not been far a-field that day, took the same path and\nmet her returning, quite pensively, as he thought.\n\nThe wheat was now tall, and the path was narrow; thus the way was\nquite a sunken groove between the embowing thicket on either side.\nTwo persons could not walk abreast without damaging the crop, and\nOak stood aside to let her pass.\n\n\"Oh, is it Gabriel?\" she said.  \"You are taking a walk too.\nGood-night.\"\n\n\"I thought I would come to meet you, as it is rather late,\" said Oak,\nturning and following at her heels when she had brushed somewhat\nquickly by him.\n\n\"Thank you, indeed, but I am not very fearful.\"\n\n\"Oh no; but there are bad characters about.\"\n\n\"I never meet them.\"\n\nNow Oak, with marvellous ingenuity, had been going to introduce the\ngallant sergeant through the channel of \"bad characters.\"  But all at\nonce the scheme broke down, it suddenly occurring to him that this\nwas rather a clumsy way, and too barefaced to begin with.  He tried\nanother preamble.\n\n\"And as the man who would naturally come to meet you is away from\nhome, too--I mean Farmer Boldwood--why, thinks I, I'll go,\" he said.\n\n\"Ah, yes.\"  She walked on without turning her head, and for many\nsteps nothing further was heard from her quarter than the rustle\nof her dress against the heavy corn-ears.  Then she resumed rather\ntartly--\n\n\"I don't quite understand what you meant by saying that Mr. Boldwood\nwould naturally come to meet me.\"\n\n\"I meant on account of the wedding which they say is likely to take\nplace between you and him, miss.  Forgive my speaking plainly.\"\n\n\"They say what is not true.\" she returned quickly.  \"No marriage is\nlikely to take place between us.\"\n\nGabriel now put forth his unobscured opinion, for the moment had\ncome.  \"Well, Miss Everdene,\" he said, \"putting aside what people\nsay, I never in my life saw any courting if his is not a courting\nof you.\"\n\nBathsheba would probably have terminated the conversation there and\nthen by flatly forbidding the subject, had not her conscious weakness\nof position allured her to palter and argue in endeavours to better\nit.\n\n\"Since this subject has been mentioned,\" she said very emphatically,\n\"I am glad of the opportunity of clearing up a mistake which is very\ncommon and very provoking.  I didn't definitely promise Mr. Boldwood\nanything.  I have never cared for him.  I respect him, and he has\nurged me to marry him.  But I have given him no distinct answer.\nAs soon as he returns I shall do so; and the answer will be that I\ncannot think of marrying him.\"\n\n\"People are full of mistakes, seemingly.\"\n\n\"They are.\"\n\n\"The other day they said you were trifling with him, and you almost\nproved that you were not; lately they have said that you be not, and\nyou straightway begin to show--\"\n\n\"That I am, I suppose you mean.\"\n\n\"Well, I hope they speak the truth.\"\n\n\"They do, but wrongly applied.  I don't trifle with him; but then, I\nhave nothing to do with him.\"\n\nOak was unfortunately led on to speak of Boldwood's rival in a wrong\ntone to her after all.  \"I wish you had never met that young Sergeant\nTroy, miss,\" he sighed.\n\nBathsheba's steps became faintly spasmodic.  \"Why?\" she asked.\n\n\"He is not good enough for 'ee.\"\n\n\"Did any one tell you to speak to me like this?\"\n\n\"Nobody at all.\"\n\n\"Then it appears to me that Sergeant Troy does not concern us here,\"\nshe said, intractably. \"Yet I must say that Sergeant Troy is an\neducated man, and quite worthy of any woman.  He is well born.\"\n\n\"His being higher in learning and birth than the ruck o' soldiers\nis anything but a proof of his worth.  It show's his course to be\ndown'ard.\"\n\n\"I cannot see what this has to do with our conversation.  Mr. Troy's\ncourse is not by any means downward; and his superiority IS a proof\nof his worth!\"\n\n\"I believe him to have no conscience at all.  And I cannot help\nbegging you, miss, to have nothing to do with him.  Listen to me this\nonce--only this once!  I don't say he's such a bad man as I have\nfancied--I pray to God he is not.  But since we don't exactly know\nwhat he is, why not behave as if he MIGHT be bad, simply for your own\nsafety?  Don't trust him, mistress; I ask you not to trust him so.\"\n\n\"Why, pray?\"\n\n\"I like soldiers, but this one I do not like,\" he said, sturdily.\n\"His cleverness in his calling may have tempted him astray, and what\nis mirth to the neighbours is ruin to the woman.  When he tries to\ntalk to 'ee again, why not turn away with a short 'Good day'; and\nwhen you see him coming one way, turn the other.  When he says\nanything laughable, fail to see the point and don't smile, and speak\nof him before those who will report your talk as 'that fantastical\nman,' or 'that Sergeant What's-his-name.' 'That man of a family\nthat has come to the dogs.'  Don't be unmannerly towards en, but\nharmless-uncivil, and so get rid of the man.\"\n\nNo Christmas robin detained by a window-pane ever pulsed as did\nBathsheba now.\n\n\"I say--I say again--that it doesn't become you to talk about\nhim.  Why he should be mentioned passes me quite!\" she exclaimed\ndesperately.  \"I know this, th-th-that he is a thoroughly\nconscientious man--blunt sometimes even to rudeness--but always\nspeaking his mind about you plain to your face!\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"He is as good as anybody in this parish!  He is very particular,\ntoo, about going to church--yes, he is!\"\n\n\"I am afeard nobody saw him there.  I never did, certainly.\"\n\n\"The reason of that is,\" she said eagerly, \"that he goes in privately\nby the old tower door, just when the service commences, and sits at\nthe back of the gallery.  He told me so.\"\n\nThis supreme instance of Troy's goodness fell upon Gabriel ears like\nthe thirteenth stroke of crazy clock.  It was not only received with\nutter incredulity as regarded itself, but threw a doubt on all the\nassurances that had preceded it.\n\nOak was grieved to find how entirely she trusted him.  He brimmed\nwith deep feeling as he replied in a steady voice, the steadiness of\nwhich was spoilt by the palpableness of his great effort to keep it\nso:--\n\n\"You know, mistress, that I love you, and shall love you always.\nI only mention this to bring to your mind that at any rate I would\nwish to do you no harm: beyond that I put it aside.  I have lost in\nthe race for money and good things, and I am not such a fool as to\npretend to 'ee now I am poor, and you have got altogether above me.\nBut Bathsheba, dear mistress, this I beg you to consider--that, both\nto keep yourself well honoured among the workfolk, and in common\ngenerosity to an honourable man who loves you as well as I, you\nshould be more discreet in your bearing towards this soldier.\"\n\n\"Don't, don't, don't!\" she exclaimed, in a choking voice.\n\n\"Are ye not more to me than my own affairs, and even life!\" he went\non.  \"Come, listen to me!  I am six years older than you, and Mr.\nBoldwood is ten years older than I, and consider--I do beg of 'ee to\nconsider before it is too late--how safe you would be in his hands!\"\n\nOak's allusion to his own love for her lessened, to some extent, her\nanger at his interference; but she could not really forgive him for\nletting his wish to marry her be eclipsed by his wish to do her good,\nany more than for his slighting treatment of Troy.\n\n\"I wish you to go elsewhere,\" she commanded, a paleness of face\ninvisible to the eye being suggested by the trembling words.  \"Do not\nremain on this farm any longer.  I don't want you--I beg you to go!\"\n\n\"That's nonsense,\" said Oak, calmly.  \"This is the second time you\nhave pretended to dismiss me; and what's the use o' it?\"\n\n\"Pretended!  You shall go, sir--your lecturing I will not hear!  I am\nmistress here.\"\n\n\"Go, indeed--what folly will you say next?  Treating me like Dick,\nTom and Harry when you know that a short time ago my position was as\ngood as yours!  Upon my life, Bathsheba, it is too barefaced.  You\nknow, too, that I can't go without putting things in such a strait as\nyou wouldn't get out of I can't tell when.  Unless, indeed, you'll\npromise to have an understanding man as bailiff, or manager, or\nsomething.  I'll go at once if you'll promise that.\"\n\n\"I shall have no bailiff; I shall continue to be my own manager,\" she\nsaid decisively.\n\n\"Very well, then; you should be thankful to me for biding.  How would\nthe farm go on with nobody to mind it but a woman?  But mind this, I\ndon't wish 'ee to feel you owe me anything.  Not I.  What I do, I do.\nSometimes I say I should be as glad as a bird to leave the place--for\ndon't suppose I'm content to be a nobody.  I was made for better\nthings.  However, I don't like to see your concerns going to ruin, as\nthey must if you keep in this mind....  I hate taking my own measure\nso plain, but, upon my life, your provoking ways make a man say\nwhat he wouldn't dream of at other times!  I own to being rather\ninterfering.  But you know well enough how it is, and who she is that\nI like too well, and feel too much like a fool about to be civil to\nher!\"\n\nIt is more than probable that she privately and unconsciously\nrespected him a little for this grim fidelity, which had been shown\nin his tone even more than in his words.  At any rate she murmured\nsomething to the effect that he might stay if he wished.  She said\nmore distinctly, \"Will you leave me alone now?  I don't order it\nas a mistress--I ask it as a woman, and I expect you not to be so\nuncourteous as to refuse.\"\n\n\"Certainly I will, Miss Everdene,\" said Gabriel, gently.  He wondered\nthat the request should have come at this moment, for the strife was\nover, and they were on a most desolate hill, far from every human\nhabitation, and the hour was getting late.  He stood still and\nallowed her to get far ahead of him till he could only see her form\nupon the sky.\n\nA distressing explanation of this anxiety to be rid of him at that\npoint now ensued.  A figure apparently rose from the earth beside\nher.  The shape beyond all doubt was Troy's.  Oak would not be even\na possible listener, and at once turned back till a good two hundred\nyards were between the lovers and himself.\n\nGabriel went home by way of the churchyard.  In passing the tower\nhe thought of what she had said about the sergeant's virtuous habit\nof entering the church unperceived at the beginning of service.\nBelieving that the little gallery door alluded to was quite disused,\nhe ascended the external flight of steps at the top of which\nit stood, and examined it.  The pale lustre yet hanging in the\nnorth-western heaven was sufficient to show that a sprig of ivy had\ngrown from the wall across the door to a length of more than a foot,\ndelicately tying the panel to the stone jamb.  It was a decisive\nproof that the door had not been opened at least since Troy came back\nto Weatherbury.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n\nHOT CHEEKS AND TEARFUL EYES\n\n\nHalf an hour later Bathsheba entered her own house.  There burnt\nupon her face when she met the light of the candles the flush and\nexcitement which were little less than chronic with her now.  The\nfarewell words of Troy, who had accompanied her to the very door,\nstill lingered in her ears.  He had bidden her adieu for two days,\nwhich were, so he stated, to be spent at Bath in visiting some\nfriends.  He had also kissed her a second time.\n\nIt is only fair to Bathsheba to explain here a little fact which\ndid not come to light till a long time afterwards: that Troy's\npresentation of himself so aptly at the roadside this evening was\nnot by any distinctly preconcerted arrangement.  He had hinted--she\nhad forbidden; and it was only on the chance of his still coming\nthat she had dismissed Oak, fearing a meeting between them just\nthen.\n\nShe now sank down into a chair, wild and perturbed by all these\nnew and fevering sequences.  Then she jumped up with a manner of\ndecision, and fetched her desk from a side table.\n\nIn three minutes, without pause or modification, she had written a\nletter to Boldwood, at his address beyond Casterbridge, saying mildly\nbut firmly that she had well considered the whole subject he had\nbrought before her and kindly given her time to decide upon; that\nher final decision was that she could not marry him.  She had\nexpressed to Oak an intention to wait till Boldwood came home before\ncommunicating to him her conclusive reply.  But Bathsheba found that\nshe could not wait.\n\nIt was impossible to send this letter till the next day; yet to quell\nher uneasiness by getting it out of her hands, and so, as it were,\nsetting the act in motion at once, she arose to take it to any one of\nthe women who might be in the kitchen.\n\nShe paused in the passage.  A dialogue was going on in the kitchen,\nand Bathsheba and Troy were the subject of it.\n\n\"If he marry her, she'll gie up farming.\"\n\n\"'Twill be a gallant life, but may bring some trouble between the\nmirth--so say I.\"\n\n\"Well, I wish I had half such a husband.\"\n\nBathsheba had too much sense to mind seriously what her servitors\nsaid about her; but too much womanly redundance of speech to leave\nalone what was said till it died the natural death of unminded\nthings.  She burst in upon them.\n\n\"Who are you speaking of?\" she asked.\n\nThere was a pause before anybody replied.  At last Liddy said\nfrankly, \"What was passing was a bit of a word about yourself, miss.\"\n\n\"I thought so!  Maryann and Liddy and Temperance--now I forbid you\nto suppose such things.  You know I don't care the least for Mr.\nTroy--not I.   Everybody knows how much I hate him.--Yes,\" repeated\nthe froward young person, \"HATE him!\"\n\n\"We know you do, miss,\" said Liddy; \"and so do we all.\"\n\n\"I hate him too,\" said Maryann.\n\n\"Maryann--Oh you perjured woman!  How can you speak that wicked\nstory!\" said Bathsheba, excitedly.  \"You admired him from your heart\nonly this morning in the very world, you did.  Yes, Maryann, you know\nit!\"\n\n\"Yes, miss, but so did you.  He is a wild scamp now, and you are\nright to hate him.\"\n\n\"He's NOT a wild scamp!  How dare you to my face!  I have no right to\nhate him, nor you, nor anybody.  But I am a silly woman!  What is it\nto me what he is?  You know it is nothing.  I don't care for him; I\ndon't mean to defend his good name, not I.  Mind this, if any of you\nsay a word against him you'll be dismissed instantly!\"\n\nShe flung down the letter and surged back into the parlour, with a\nbig heart and tearful eyes, Liddy following her.\n\n\"Oh miss!\" said mild Liddy, looking pitifully into Bathsheba's face.\n\"I am sorry we mistook you so!  I did think you cared for him; but I\nsee you don't now.\"\n\n\"Shut the door, Liddy.\"\n\nLiddy closed the door, and went on: \"People always say such foolery,\nmiss.  I'll make answer hencefor'ard, 'Of course a lady like Miss\nEverdene can't love him'; I'll say it out in plain black and white.\"\n\nBathsheba burst out: \"O Liddy, are you such a simpleton?  Can't you\nread riddles?  Can't you see?  Are you a woman yourself?\"\n\nLiddy's clear eyes rounded with wonderment.\n\n\"Yes; you must be a blind thing, Liddy!\" she said, in reckless\nabandonment and grief.  \"Oh, I love him to very distraction and\nmisery and agony!  Don't be frightened at me, though perhaps I am\nenough to frighten any innocent woman.  Come closer--closer.\" She\nput her arms round Liddy's neck.  \"I must let it out to somebody; it\nis wearing me away!  Don't you yet know enough of me to see through\nthat miserable denial of mine?  O God, what a lie it was! Heaven and\nmy Love forgive me.  And don't you know that a woman who loves at\nall thinks nothing of perjury when it is balanced against her love?\nThere, go out of the room; I want to be quite alone.\"\n\nLiddy went towards the door.\n\n\"Liddy, come here.  Solemnly swear to me that he's not a fast man;\nthat it is all lies they say about him!\"\n\n\"But, miss, how can I say he is not if--\"\n\n\"You graceless girl!  How can you have the cruel heart to repeat what\nthey say?  Unfeeling thing that you are....  But I'LL see if you or\nanybody else in the village, or town either, dare do such a thing!\"\nShe started off, pacing from fireplace to door, and back again.\n\n\"No, miss.  I don't--I know it is not true!\" said Liddy, frightened\nat Bathsheba's unwonted vehemence.\n\n\"I suppose you only agree with me like that to please me.  But,\nLiddy, he CANNOT BE bad, as is said.  Do you hear?\"\n\n\"Yes, miss, yes.\"\n\n\"And you don't believe he is?\"\n\n\"I don't know what to say, miss,\" said Liddy, beginning to cry.  \"If\nI say No, you don't believe me; and if I say Yes, you rage at me!\"\n\n\"Say you don't believe it--say you don't!\"\n\n\"I don't believe him to be so bad as they make out.\"\n\n\"He is not bad at all....  My poor life and heart, how weak I\nam!\" she moaned, in a relaxed, desultory way, heedless of Liddy's\npresence.  \"Oh, how I wish I had never seen him!  Loving is misery\nfor women always.  I shall never forgive God for making me a woman,\nand dearly am I beginning to pay for the honour of owning a pretty\nface.\"  She freshened and turned to Liddy suddenly.  \"Mind this,\nLydia Smallbury, if you repeat anywhere a single word of what I have\nsaid to you inside this closed door, I'll never trust you, or love\nyou, or have you with me a moment longer--not a moment!\"\n\n\"I don't want to repeat anything,\" said Liddy, with womanly dignity\nof a diminutive order; \"but I don't wish to stay with you.  And,\nif you please, I'll go at the end of the harvest, or this week, or\nto-day....  I don't see that I deserve to be put upon and stormed at\nfor nothing!\" concluded the small woman, bigly.\n\n\"No, no, Liddy; you must stay!\" said Bathsheba, dropping from\nhaughtiness to entreaty with capricious inconsequence.  \"You must not\nnotice my being in a taking just now.  You are not as a servant--you\nare a companion to me.  Dear, dear--I don't know what I am doing\nsince this miserable ache of my heart has weighted and worn upon me\nso!  What shall I come to!  I suppose I shall get further and further\ninto troubles.  I wonder sometimes if I am doomed to die in the\nUnion.  I am friendless enough, God knows!\"\n\n\"I won't notice anything, nor will I leave you!\" sobbed Liddy,\nimpulsively putting up her lips to Bathsheba's, and kissing her.\n\nThen Bathsheba kissed Liddy, and all was smooth again.\n\n\"I don't often cry, do I, Lidd? but you have made tears come into my\neyes,\" she said, a smile shining through the moisture.  \"Try to think\nhim a good man, won't you, dear Liddy?\"\n\n\"I will, miss, indeed.\"\n\n\"He is a sort of steady man in a wild way, you know.  That's better\nthan to be as some are, wild in a steady way.  I am afraid that's\nhow I am.  And promise me to keep my secret--do, Liddy!  And do not\nlet them know that I have been crying about him, because it will be\ndreadful for me, and no good to him, poor thing!\"\n\n\"Death's head himself shan't wring it from me, mistress, if I've\na mind to keep anything; and I'll always be your friend,\" replied\nLiddy, emphatically, at the same time bringing a few more tears into\nher own eyes, not from any particular necessity, but from an artistic\nsense of making herself in keeping with the remainder of the picture,\nwhich seems to influence women at such times.  \"I think God likes us\nto be good friends, don't you?\"\n\n\"Indeed I do.\"\n\n\"And, dear miss, you won't harry me and storm at me, will you?\nbecause you seem to swell so tall as a lion then, and it frightens\nme!  Do you know, I fancy you would be a match for any man when you\nare in one o' your takings.\"\n\n\"Never! do you?\" said Bathsheba, slightly laughing, though somewhat\nseriously alarmed by this Amazonian picture of herself.  \"I hope I am\nnot a bold sort of maid--mannish?\" she continued with some anxiety.\n\n\"Oh no, not mannish; but so almighty womanish that 'tis getting on\nthat way sometimes.  Ah! miss,\" she said, after having drawn her\nbreath very sadly in and sent it very sadly out, \"I wish I had half\nyour failing that way.  'Tis a great protection to a poor maid in\nthese illegit'mate days!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n\nBLAME--FURY\n\n\nThe next evening Bathsheba, with the idea of getting out of the way\nof Mr. Boldwood in the event of his returning to answer her note\nin person, proceeded to fulfil an engagement made with Liddy some\nfew hours earlier.  Bathsheba's companion, as a gauge of their\nreconciliation, had been granted a week's holiday to visit her\nsister, who was married to a thriving hurdler and cattle-crib-maker\nliving in a delightful labyrinth of hazel copse not far beyond\nYalbury.  The arrangement was that Miss Everdene should honour\nthem by coming there for a day or two to inspect some ingenious\ncontrivances which this man of the woods had introduced into his\nwares.\n\nLeaving her instructions with Gabriel and Maryann, that they were to\nsee everything carefully locked up for the night, she went out of the\nhouse just at the close of a timely thunder-shower, which had refined\nthe air, and daintily bathed the coat of the land, though all beneath\nwas dry as ever.  Freshness was exhaled in an essence from the varied\ncontours of bank and hollow, as if the earth breathed maiden breath;\nand the pleased birds were hymning to the scene.  Before her, among\nthe clouds, there was a contrast in the shape of lairs of fierce\nlight which showed themselves in the neighbourhood of a hidden sun,\nlingering on to the farthest north-west corner of the heavens that\nthis midsummer season allowed.\n\nShe had walked nearly two miles of her journey, watching how the\nday was retreating, and thinking how the time of deeds was quietly\nmelting into the time of thought, to give place in its turn to the\ntime of prayer and sleep, when she beheld advancing over Yalbury\nhill the very man she sought so anxiously to elude.  Boldwood was\nstepping on, not with that quiet tread of reserved strength which\nwas his customary gait, in which he always seemed to be balancing\ntwo thoughts.  His manner was stunned and sluggish now.\n\nBoldwood had for the first time been awakened to woman's privileges\nin tergiversation even when it involves another person's possible\nblight.  That Bathsheba was a firm and positive girl, far less\ninconsequent than her fellows, had been the very lung of his hope;\nfor he had held that these qualities would lead her to adhere to a\nstraight course for consistency's sake, and accept him, though her\nfancy might not flood him with the iridescent hues of uncritical\nlove.  But the argument now came back as sorry gleams from a broken\nmirror.  The discovery was no less a scourge than a surprise.\n\nHe came on looking upon the ground, and did not see Bathsheba till\nthey were less than a stone's throw apart.  He looked up at the sound\nof her pit-pat, and his changed appearance sufficiently denoted to\nher the depth and strength of the feelings paralyzed by her letter.\n\n\"Oh; is it you, Mr. Boldwood?\" she faltered, a guilty warmth pulsing\nin her face.\n\nThose who have the power of reproaching in silence may find it a\nmeans more effective than words.  There are accents in the eye which\nare not on the tongue, and more tales come from pale lips than can\nenter an ear.  It is both the grandeur and the pain of the remoter\nmoods that they avoid the pathway of sound.  Boldwood's look was\nunanswerable.\n\nSeeing she turned a little aside, he said, \"What, are you afraid of\nme?\"\n\n\"Why should you say that?\" said Bathsheba.\n\n\"I fancied you looked so,\" said he.  \"And it is most strange, because\nof its contrast with my feeling for you.\"\n\nShe regained self-possession, fixed her eyes calmly, and waited.\n\n\"You know what that feeling is,\" continued Boldwood, deliberately.\n\"A thing strong as death.  No dismissal by a hasty letter affects\nthat.\"\n\n\"I wish you did not feel so strongly about me,\" she murmured.  \"It is\ngenerous of you, and more than I deserve, but I must not hear it\nnow.\"\n\n\"Hear it?  What do you think I have to say, then?  I am not to marry\nyou, and that's enough.  Your letter was excellently plain.  I want\nyou to hear nothing--not I.\"\n\nBathsheba was unable to direct her will into any definite groove for\nfreeing herself from this fearfully awkward position.  She confusedly\nsaid, \"Good evening,\" and was moving on.  Boldwood walked up to her\nheavily and dully.\n\n\"Bathsheba--darling--is it final indeed?\"\n\n\"Indeed it is.\"\n\n\"Oh, Bathsheba--have pity upon me!\" Boldwood burst out. \"God's sake,\nyes--I am come to that low, lowest stage--to ask a woman for pity!\nStill, she is you--she is you.\"\n\nBathsheba commanded herself well.  But she could hardly get a clear\nvoice for what came instinctively to her lips: \"There is little\nhonour to the woman in that speech.\"  It was only whispered, for\nsomething unutterably mournful no less than distressing in this\nspectacle of a man showing himself to be so entirely the vane of a\npassion enervated the feminine instinct for punctilios.\n\n\"I am beyond myself about this, and am mad,\" he said.  \"I am no stoic\nat all to be supplicating here; but I do supplicate to you.  I wish\nyou knew what is in me of devotion to you; but it is impossible,\nthat.  In bare human mercy to a lonely man, don't throw me off now!\"\n\n\"I don't throw you off--indeed, how can I?  I never had you.\"  In her\nnoon-clear sense that she had never loved him she forgot for a moment\nher thoughtless angle on that day in February.\n\n\"But there was a time when you turned to me, before I thought of you!\nI don't reproach you, for even now I feel that the ignorant and cold\ndarkness that I should have lived in if you had not attracted me by\nthat letter--valentine you call it--would have been worse than my\nknowledge of you, though it has brought this misery.  But, I say,\nthere was a time when I knew nothing of you, and cared nothing\nfor you, and yet you drew me on.  And if you say you gave me no\nencouragement, I cannot but contradict you.\"\n\n\"What you call encouragement was the childish game of an idle minute.\nI have bitterly repented of it--ay, bitterly, and in tears.  Can you\nstill go on reminding me?\"\n\n\"I don't accuse you of it--I deplore it.  I took for earnest what\nyou insist was jest, and now this that I pray to be jest you say is\nawful, wretched earnest.  Our moods meet at wrong places.  I wish\nyour feeling was more like mine, or my feeling more like yours!  Oh,\ncould I but have foreseen the torture that trifling trick was going\nto lead me into, how I should have cursed you; but only having been\nable to see it since, I cannot do that, for I love you too well!  But\nit is weak, idle drivelling to go on like this....  Bathsheba, you\nare the first woman of any shade or nature that I have ever looked at\nto love, and it is the having been so near claiming you for my own\nthat makes this denial so hard to bear.  How nearly you promised me!\nBut I don't speak now to move your heart, and make you grieve because\nof my pain; it is no use, that.  I must bear it; my pain would get no\nless by paining you.\"\n\n\"But I do pity you--deeply--O, so deeply!\" she earnestly said.\n\n\"Do no such thing--do no such thing.  Your dear love, Bathsheba, is\nsuch a vast thing beside your pity, that the loss of your pity as\nwell as your love is no great addition to my sorrow, nor does the\ngain of your pity make it sensibly less.  O sweet--how dearly you\nspoke to me behind the spear-bed at the washing-pool, and in the barn\nat the shearing, and that dearest last time in the evening at your\nhome!  Where are your pleasant words all gone--your earnest hope to\nbe able to love me?  Where is your firm conviction that you would get\nto care for me very much?  Really forgotten?--really?\"\n\nShe checked emotion, looked him quietly and clearly in the face, and\nsaid in her low, firm voice, \"Mr. Boldwood, I promised you nothing.\nWould you have had me a woman of clay when you paid me that furthest,\nhighest compliment a man can pay a woman--telling her he loves her?\nI was bound to show some feeling, if I would not be a graceless\nshrew.  Yet each of those pleasures was just for the day--the day\njust for the pleasure.  How was I to know that what is a pastime to\nall other men was death to you?  Have reason, do, and think more\nkindly of me!\"\n\n\"Well, never mind arguing--never mind.  One thing is sure: you\nwere all but mine, and now you are not nearly mine.  Everything is\nchanged, and that by you alone, remember.  You were nothing to me\nonce, and I was contented; you are now nothing to me again, and how\ndifferent the second nothing is from the first!  Would to God you\nhad never taken me up, since it was only to throw me down!\"\n\nBathsheba, in spite of her mettle, began to feel unmistakable signs\nthat she was inherently the weaker vessel. She strove miserably\nagainst this femininity which would insist upon supplying unbidden\nemotions in stronger and stronger current.  She had tried to elude\nagitation by fixing her mind on the trees, sky, any trivial object\nbefore her eyes, whilst his reproaches fell, but ingenuity could not\nsave her now.\n\n\"I did not take you up--surely I did not!\" she answered as heroically\nas she could.  \"But don't be in this mood with me.  I can endure\nbeing told I am in the wrong, if you will only tell it me gently!\nO sir, will you not kindly forgive me, and look at it cheerfully?\"\n\n\"Cheerfully!  Can a man fooled to utter heart-burning find a reason\nfor being merry?  If I have lost, how can I be as if I had won?\nHeavens you must be heartless quite!  Had I known what a fearfully\nbitter sweet this was to be, how I would have avoided you, and never\nseen you, and been deaf of you.  I tell you all this, but what do you\ncare!  You don't care.\"\n\nShe returned silent and weak denials to his charges, and swayed\nher head desperately, as if to thrust away the words as they came\nshowering about her ears from the lips of the trembling man in the\nclimax of life, with his bronzed Roman face and fine frame.\n\n\"Dearest, dearest, I am wavering even now between the two opposites\nof recklessly renouncing you, and labouring humbly for you again.\nForget that you have said No, and let it be as it was!  Say,\nBathsheba, that you only wrote that refusal to me in fun--come, say\nit to me!\"\n\n\"It would be untrue, and painful to both of us.  You overrate my\ncapacity for love.  I don't possess half the warmth of nature you\nbelieve me to have.  An unprotected childhood in a cold world has\nbeaten gentleness out of me.\"\n\nHe immediately said with more resentment: \"That may be true,\nsomewhat; but ah, Miss Everdene, it won't do as a reason!  You are\nnot the cold woman you would have me believe.  No, no!  It isn't\nbecause you have no feeling in you that you don't love me.  You\nnaturally would have me think so--you would hide from me that you\nhave a burning heart like mine.  You have love enough, but it is\nturned into a new channel. I know where.\"\n\nThe swift music of her heart became hubbub now, and she throbbed\nto extremity.  He was coming to Troy.  He did then know what had\noccurred!  And the name fell from his lips the next moment.\n\n\"Why did Troy not leave my treasure alone?\" he asked, fiercely.\n\"When I had no thought of injuring him, why did he force himself upon\nyour notice!  Before he worried you your inclination was to have me;\nwhen next I should have come to you your answer would have been Yes.\nCan you deny it--I ask, can you deny it?\"\n\nShe delayed the reply, but was too honest to withhold it.  \"I\ncannot,\" she whispered.\n\n\"I know you cannot.  But he stole in in my absence and robbed me.\nWhy didn't he win you away before, when nobody would have been\ngrieved?--when nobody would have been set tale-bearing.  Now the\npeople sneer at me--the very hills and sky seem to laugh at me till I\nblush shamefully for my folly.  I have lost my respect, my good name,\nmy standing--lost it, never to get it again.  Go and marry your\nman--go on!\"\n\n\"Oh sir--Mr. Boldwood!\"\n\n\"You may as well.  I have no further claim upon you.  As for me, I\nhad better go somewhere alone, and hide--and pray. I loved a woman\nonce.  I am now ashamed.  When I am dead they'll say, miserable\nlove-sick man that he was.  Heaven--heaven--if I had got jilted\nsecretly, and the dishonour not known, and my position kept!  But\nno matter, it is gone, and the woman not gained.  Shame upon\nhim--shame!\"\n\nHis unreasonable anger terrified her, and she glided from him,\nwithout obviously moving, as she said, \"I am only a girl--do not\nspeak to me so!\"\n\n\"All the time you knew--how very well you knew--that your new freak\nwas my misery.  Dazzled by brass and scarlet--Oh, Bathsheba--this is\nwoman's folly indeed!\"\n\nShe fired up at once.  \"You are taking too much upon yourself!\" she\nsaid, vehemently.  \"Everybody is upon me--everybody.  It is unmanly\nto attack a woman so!  I have nobody in the world to fight my battles\nfor me; but no mercy is shown.  Yet if a thousand of you sneer and\nsay things against me, I WILL NOT be put down!\"\n\n\"You'll chatter with him doubtless about me.  Say to him, 'Boldwood\nwould have died for me.'  Yes, and you have given way to him, knowing\nhim to be not the man for you.  He has kissed you--claimed you as\nhis.  Do you hear--he has kissed you.  Deny it!\"\n\nThe most tragic woman is cowed by a tragic man, and although Boldwood\nwas, in vehemence and glow, nearly her own self rendered into another\nsex, Bathsheba's cheek quivered.  She gasped, \"Leave me, sir--leave\nme!  I am nothing to you.  Let me go on!\"\n\n\"Deny that he has kissed you.\"\n\n\"I shall not.\"\n\n\"Ha--then he has!\" came hoarsely from the farmer.\n\n\"He has,\" she said, slowly, and, in spite of her fear, defiantly.  \"I\nam not ashamed to speak the truth.\"\n\n\"Then curse him; and curse him!\" said Boldwood, breaking into a\nwhispered fury. \"Whilst I would have given worlds to touch your hand,\nyou have let a rake come in without right or ceremony and--kiss you!\nHeaven's mercy--kiss you! ...  Ah, a time of his life shall come\nwhen he will have to repent, and think wretchedly of the pain he has\ncaused another man; and then may he ache, and wish, and curse, and\nyearn--as I do now!\"\n\n\"Don't, don't, oh, don't pray down evil upon him!\" she implored in a\nmiserable cry.  \"Anything but that--anything.  Oh, be kind to him,\nsir, for I love him true!\"\n\nBoldwood's ideas had reached that point of fusion at which outline\nand consistency entirely disappear.  The impending night appeared to\nconcentrate in his eye.  He did not hear her at all now.\n\n\"I'll punish him--by my soul, that will I!  I'll meet him, soldier or\nno, and I'll horsewhip the untimely stripling for this reckless theft\nof my one delight.  If he were a hundred men I'd horsewhip him--\"\nHe dropped his voice suddenly and unnaturally.  \"Bathsheba, sweet,\nlost coquette, pardon me!  I've been blaming you, threatening you,\nbehaving like a churl to you, when he's the greatest sinner.  He\nstole your dear heart away with his unfathomable lies! ...  It is a\nfortunate thing for him that he's gone back to his regiment--that\nhe's away up the country, and not here!  I hope he may not return\nhere just yet.  I pray God he may not come into my sight, for I may\nbe tempted beyond myself.  Oh, Bathsheba, keep him away--yes, keep\nhim away from me!\"\n\nFor a moment Boldwood stood so inertly after this that his soul\nseemed to have been entirely exhaled with the breath of his\npassionate words.  He turned his face away, and withdrew, and his\nform was soon covered over by the twilight as his footsteps mixed\nin with the low hiss of the leafy trees.\n\nBathsheba, who had been standing motionless as a model all this\nlatter time, flung her hands to her face, and wildly attempted to\nponder on the exhibition which had just passed away.  Such astounding\nwells of fevered feeling in a still man like Mr. Boldwood were\nincomprehensible, dreadful.  Instead of being a man trained to\nrepression he was--what she had seen him.\n\nThe force of the farmer's threats lay in their relation to a\ncircumstance known at present only to herself: her lover was coming\nback to Weatherbury in the course of the very next day or two.  Troy\nhad not returned to his distant barracks as Boldwood and others\nsupposed, but had merely gone to visit some acquaintance in Bath,\nand had yet a week or more remaining to his furlough.\n\nShe felt wretchedly certain that if he revisited her just at this\nnick of time, and came into contact with Boldwood, a fierce quarrel\nwould be the consequence.  She panted with solicitude when she\nthought of possible injury to Troy.  The least spark would kindle\nthe farmer's swift feelings of rage and jealousy; he would lose his\nself-mastery as he had this evening; Troy's blitheness might become\naggressive; it might take the direction of derision, and Boldwood's\nanger might then take the direction of revenge.\n\nWith almost a morbid dread of being thought a gushing girl, this\nguileless woman too well concealed from the world under a manner of\ncarelessness the warm depths of her strong emotions.  But now there\nwas no reserve.  In her distraction, instead of advancing further she\nwalked up and down, beating the air with her fingers, pressing on her\nbrow, and sobbing brokenly to herself.  Then she sat down on a heap\nof stones by the wayside to think.  There she remained long.  Above\nthe dark margin of the earth appeared foreshores and promontories of\ncoppery cloud, bounding a green and pellucid expanse in the western\nsky.  Amaranthine glosses came over them then, and the unresting\nworld wheeled her round to a contrasting prospect eastward, in the\nshape of indecisive and palpitating stars.  She gazed upon their\nsilent throes amid the shades of space, but realised none at all.\nHer troubled spirit was far away with Troy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n\nNIGHT--HORSES TRAMPING\n\n\nThe village of Weatherbury was quiet as the graveyard in its midst,\nand the living were lying well-nigh as still as the dead.  The church\nclock struck eleven.  The air was so empty of other sounds that the\nwhirr of the clock-work immediately before the strokes was distinct,\nand so was also the click of the same at their close.  The notes flew\nforth with the usual blind obtuseness of inanimate things--flapping\nand rebounding among walls, undulating against the scattered clouds,\nspreading through their interstices into unexplored miles of space.\n\nBathsheba's crannied and mouldy halls were to-night occupied only by\nMaryann, Liddy being, as was stated, with her sister, whom Bathsheba\nhad set out to visit.  A few minutes after eleven had struck, Maryann\nturned in her bed with a sense of being disturbed.  She was totally\nunconscious of the nature of the interruption to her sleep.  It led\nto a dream, and the dream to an awakening, with an uneasy sensation\nthat something had happened.  She left her bed and looked out of the\nwindow.  The paddock abutted on this end of the building, and in the\npaddock she could just discern by the uncertain gray a moving figure\napproaching the horse that was feeding there.  The figure seized the\nhorse by the forelock, and led it to the corner of the field.  Here\nshe could see some object which circumstances proved to be a vehicle,\nfor after a few minutes spent apparently in harnessing, she heard the\ntrot of the horse down the road, mingled with the sound of light\nwheels.\n\nTwo varieties only of humanity could have entered the paddock with\nthe ghostlike glide of that mysterious figure.  They were a woman and\na gipsy man.  A woman was out of the question in such an occupation\nat this hour, and the comer could be no less than a thief, who might\nprobably have known the weakness of the household on this particular\nnight, and have chosen it on that account for his daring attempt.\nMoreover, to raise suspicion to conviction itself, there were gipsies\nin Weatherbury Bottom.\n\nMaryann, who had been afraid to shout in the robber's presence,\nhaving seen him depart had no fear.  She hastily slipped on her\nclothes, stumped down the disjointed staircase with its hundred\ncreaks, ran to Coggan's, the nearest house, and raised an alarm.\nCoggan called Gabriel, who now again lodged in his house as at first,\nand together they went to the paddock.  Beyond all doubt the horse\nwas gone.\n\n\"Hark!\" said Gabriel.\n\nThey listened.  Distinct upon the stagnant air came the sounds of a\ntrotting horse passing up Longpuddle Lane--just beyond the gipsies'\nencampment in Weatherbury Bottom.\n\n\"That's our Dainty--I'll swear to her step,\" said Jan.\n\n\"Mighty me!  Won't mis'ess storm and call us stupids when she comes\nback!\" moaned Maryann.  \"How I wish it had happened when she was at\nhome, and none of us had been answerable!\"\n\n\"We must ride after,\" said Gabriel, decisively.  \"I'll  be\nresponsible to Miss Everdene for what we do.  Yes, we'll follow.\"\n\n\"Faith, I don't see how,\" said Coggan.  \"All our horses are too heavy\nfor that trick except little Poppet, and what's she between two of\nus?--If we only had that pair over the hedge we might do something.\"\n\n\"Which pair?\"\n\n\"Mr. Boldwood's Tidy and Moll.\"\n\n\"Then wait here till I come hither again,\" said Gabriel.  He ran down\nthe hill towards Farmer Boldwood's.\n\n\"Farmer Boldwood is not at home,\" said Maryann.\n\n\"All the better,\" said Coggan.  \"I know what he's gone for.\"\n\nLess than five minutes brought up Oak again, running at the same\npace, with two halters dangling from his hand.\n\n\"Where did you find 'em?\" said Coggan, turning round and leaping upon\nthe hedge without waiting for an answer.\n\n\"Under the eaves.  I knew where they were kept,\" said Gabriel,\nfollowing him.  \"Coggan, you can ride bare-backed? there's no time to\nlook for saddles.\"\n\n\"Like a hero!\" said Jan.\n\n\"Maryann, you go to bed,\" Gabriel shouted to her from the top of the\nhedge.\n\nSpringing down into Boldwood's pastures, each pocketed his halter to\nhide it from the horses, who, seeing the men empty-handed, docilely\nallowed themselves to be seized by the mane, when the halters were\ndexterously slipped on.  Having neither bit nor bridle, Oak and\nCoggan extemporized the former by passing the rope in each case\nthrough the animal's mouth and looping it on the other side.  Oak\nvaulted astride, and Coggan clambered up by aid of the bank, when\nthey ascended to the gate and galloped off in the direction taken by\nBathsheba's horse and the robber.  Whose vehicle the horse had been\nharnessed to was a matter of some uncertainty.\n\nWeatherbury Bottom was reached in three or four minutes.  They\nscanned the shady green patch by the roadside.  The gipsies were\ngone.\n\n\"The villains!\" said Gabriel.  \"Which way have they gone, I wonder?\"\n\n\"Straight on, as sure as God made little apples,\" said Jan.\n\n\"Very well; we are better mounted, and must overtake em\", said Oak.\n\"Now on at full speed!\"\n\nNo sound of the rider in their van could now be discovered.  The\nroad-metal grew softer and more clayey as Weatherbury was left\nbehind, and the late rain had wetted its surface to a somewhat\nplastic, but not muddy state.  They came to cross-roads.  Coggan\nsuddenly pulled up Moll and slipped off.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"We must try to track 'em, since we can't hear 'em,\" said Jan,\nfumbling in his pockets.  He struck a light, and held the match to\nthe ground.  The rain had been heavier here, and all foot and horse\ntracks made previous to the storm had been abraded and blurred by\nthe drops, and they were now so many little scoops of water, which\nreflected the flame of the match like eyes.  One set of tracks was\nfresh and had no water in them; one pair of ruts was also empty,\nand not small canals, like the others.  The footprints forming this\nrecent impression were full of information as to pace; they were in\nequidistant pairs, three or four feet apart, the right and left foot\nof each pair being exactly opposite one another.\n\n\"Straight on!\" Jan exclaimed.  \"Tracks like that mean a stiff gallop.\nNo wonder we don't hear him.  And the horse is harnessed--look at the\nruts.  Ay, that's our mare sure enough!\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"Old Jimmy Harris only shoed her last week, and I'd swear to his make\namong ten thousand.\"\n\n\"The rest of the gipsies must ha' gone on earlier, or some other\nway,\" said Oak.  \"You saw there were no other tracks?\"\n\n\"True.\" They rode along silently for a long weary time. Coggan\ncarried an old pinchbeck repeater which he had inherited from some\ngenius in his family; and it now struck one.  He lighted another\nmatch, and examined the ground again.\n\n\"'Tis a canter now,\" he said, throwing away the light.  \"A twisty,\nrickety pace for a gig.  The fact is, they over-drove her at\nstarting; we shall catch 'em yet.\"\n\nAgain they hastened on, and entered Blackmore Vale.  Coggan's watch\nstruck one.  When they looked again the hoof-marks were so spaced as\nto form a sort of zigzag if united, like the lamps along a street.\n\n\"That's a trot, I know,\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"Only a trot now,\" said Coggan, cheerfully.  \"We shall overtake him\nin time.\"\n\nThey pushed rapidly on for yet two or three miles.  \"Ah! a moment,\"\nsaid Jan.  \"Let's see how she was driven up this hill.  'Twill help\nus.\"  A light was promptly struck upon his gaiters as before, and the\nexamination made.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" said Coggan.  \"She walked up here--and well she might.  We\nshall get them in two miles, for a crown.\"\n\nThey rode three, and listened.  No sound was to be heard save a\nmillpond trickling hoarsely through a hatch, and suggesting gloomy\npossibilities of drowning by jumping in.  Gabriel dismounted when\nthey came to a turning.  The tracks were absolutely the only guide as\nto the direction that they now had, and great caution was necessary\nto avoid confusing them with some others which had made their\nappearance lately.\n\n\"What does this mean?--though I guess,\" said Gabriel, looking up\nat Coggan as he moved the match over the ground about the turning.\nCoggan, who, no less than the panting horses, had latterly shown\nsigns of weariness, again scrutinized the mystic characters.  This\ntime only three were of the regular horseshoe shape.  Every fourth\nwas a dot.\n\nHe screwed up his face and emitted a long \"Whew-w-w!\"\n\n\"Lame,\" said Oak.\n\n\"Yes.  Dainty is lamed; the near-foot-afore,\" said Coggan slowly,\nstaring still at the footprints.\n\n\"We'll push on,\" said Gabriel, remounting his humid steed.\n\nAlthough the road along its greater part had been as good as any\nturnpike-road in the country, it was nominally only a byway.  The\nlast turning had brought them into the high road leading to Bath.\nCoggan recollected himself.\n\n\"We shall have him now!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Sherton Turnpike.  The keeper of that gate is the sleepiest man\nbetween here and London--Dan Randall, that's his name--knowed en for\nyears, when he was at Casterbridge gate. Between the lameness and the\ngate 'tis a done job.\"\n\nThey now advanced with extreme caution.  Nothing was said until,\nagainst a shady background of foliage, five white bars were visible,\ncrossing their route a little way ahead.\n\n\"Hush--we are almost close!\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"Amble on upon the grass,\" said Coggan.\n\nThe white bars were blotted out in the midst by a dark shape in\nfront of them.  The silence of this lonely time was pierced by an\nexclamation from that quarter.\n\n\"Hoy-a-hoy!  Gate!\"\n\nIt appeared that there had been a previous call which they had not\nnoticed, for on their close approach the door of the turnpike-house\nopened, and the keeper came out half-dressed, with a candle in his\nhand.  The rays illumined the whole group.\n\n\"Keep the gate close!\" shouted Gabriel.  \"He has stolen the horse!\"\n\n\"Who?\" said the turnpike-man.\n\nGabriel looked at the driver of the gig, and saw a woman--Bathsheba,\nhis mistress.\n\nOn hearing his voice she had turned her face away from the light.\nCoggan had, however, caught sight of her in the meanwhile.\n\n\"Why, 'tis mistress--I'll take my oath!\" he said, amazed.\n\nBathsheba it certainly was, and she had by this time done the trick\nshe could do so well in crises not of love, namely, mask a surprise\nby coolness of manner.\n\n\"Well, Gabriel,\" she inquired quietly, \"where are you going?\"\n\n\"We thought--\" began Gabriel.\n\n\"I am driving to Bath,\" she said, taking for her own use the\nassurance that Gabriel lacked.  \"An important matter made it\nnecessary for me to give up my visit to Liddy, and go off at once.\nWhat, then, were you following me?\"\n\n\"We thought the horse was stole.\"\n\n\"Well--what a thing!  How very foolish of you not to know that I had\ntaken the trap and horse.  I could neither wake Maryann nor get into\nthe house, though I hammered for ten minutes against her window-sill.\nFortunately, I could get the key of the coach-house, so I troubled no\none further. Didn't you think it might be me?\"\n\n\"Why should we, miss?\"\n\n\"Perhaps not.  Why, those are never Farmer Boldwood's horses!\nGoodness mercy! what have you been doing--bringing trouble upon me in\nthis way?  What! mustn't a lady move an inch from her door without\nbeing dogged like a thief?\"\n\n\"But how was we to know, if you left no account of your doings?\"\nexpostulated Coggan, \"and ladies don't drive at these hours, miss,\nas a jineral rule of society.\"\n\n\"I did leave an account--and you would have seen it in the morning.\nI wrote in chalk on the coach-house doors that I had come back for\nthe horse and gig, and driven off; that I could arouse nobody, and\nshould return soon.\"\n\n\"But you'll consider, ma'am, that we couldn't see that till it got\ndaylight.\"\n\n\"True,\" she said, and though vexed at first she had too much sense\nto blame them long or seriously for a devotion to her that was as\nvaluable as it was rare.  She added with a very pretty grace, \"Well,\nI really thank you heartily for taking all this trouble; but I wish\nyou had borrowed anybody's horses but Mr. Boldwood's.\"\n\n\"Dainty is lame, miss,\" said Coggan.  \"Can ye go on?\"\n\n\"It was only a stone in her shoe.  I got down and pulled it out a\nhundred yards back.  I can manage very well, thank you.  I shall be\nin Bath by daylight.  Will you now return, please?\"\n\nShe turned her head--the gateman's candle shimmering upon her quick,\nclear eyes as she did so--passed through the gate, and was soon\nwrapped in the embowering shades of mysterious summer boughs.  Coggan\nand Gabriel put about their horses, and, fanned by the velvety air of\nthis July night, retraced the road by which they had come.\n\n\"A strange vagary, this of hers, isn't it, Oak?\" said Coggan,\ncuriously.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Gabriel, shortly.\n\n\"She won't be in Bath by no daylight!\"\n\n\"Coggan, suppose we keep this night's work as quiet as we can?\"\n\n\"I am of one and the same mind.\"\n\n\"Very well.  We shall be home by three o'clock or so, and can creep\ninto the parish like lambs.\"\n\n\nBathsheba's perturbed meditations by the roadside had ultimately\nevolved a conclusion that there were only two remedies for the\npresent desperate state of affairs.  The first was merely to\nkeep Troy away from Weatherbury till Boldwood's indignation had\ncooled; the second to listen to Oak's entreaties, and Boldwood's\ndenunciations, and give up Troy altogether.\n\nAlas!  Could she give up this new love--induce him to renounce her\nby saying she did not like him--could no more speak to him, and beg\nhim, for her good, to end his furlough in Bath, and see her and\nWeatherbury no more?\n\nIt was a picture full of misery, but for a while she contemplated it\nfirmly, allowing herself, nevertheless, as girls will, to dwell upon\nthe happy life she would have enjoyed had Troy been Boldwood, and the\npath of love the path of duty--inflicting upon herself gratuitous\ntortures by imagining him the lover of another woman after forgetting\nher; for she had penetrated Troy's nature so far as to estimate his\ntendencies pretty accurately, but unfortunately loved him no less in\nthinking that he might soon cease to love her--indeed, considerably\nmore.\n\nShe jumped to her feet.  She would see him at once.  Yes, she would\nimplore him by word of mouth to assist her in this dilemma.  A letter\nto keep him away could not reach him in time, even if he should be\ndisposed to listen to it.\n\nWas Bathsheba altogether blind to the obvious fact that the support\nof a lover's arms is not of a kind best calculated to assist a\nresolve to renounce him?  Or was she sophistically sensible, with a\nthrill of pleasure, that by adopting this course for getting rid of\nhim she was ensuring a meeting with him, at any rate, once more?\n\nIt was now dark, and the hour must have been nearly ten.  The only\nway to accomplish her purpose was to give up her idea of visiting\nLiddy at Yalbury, return to Weatherbury Farm, put the horse into\nthe gig, and drive at once to Bath.  The scheme seemed at first\nimpossible: the journey was a fearfully heavy one, even for a strong\nhorse, at her own estimate; and she much underrated the distance.\nIt was most venturesome for a woman, at night, and alone.\n\nBut could she go on to Liddy's and leave things to take their course?\nNo, no; anything but that.  Bathsheba was full of a stimulating\nturbulence, beside which caution vainly prayed for a hearing.  She\nturned back towards the village.\n\nHer walk was slow, for she wished not to enter Weatherbury till the\ncottagers were in bed, and, particularly, till Boldwood was secure.\nHer plan was now to drive to Bath during the night, see Sergeant Troy\nin the morning before he set out to come to her, bid him farewell,\nand dismiss him: then to rest the horse thoroughly (herself to weep\nthe while, she thought), starting early the next morning on her\nreturn journey.  By this arrangement she could trot Dainty gently\nall the day, reach Liddy at Yalbury in the evening, and come home to\nWeatherbury with her whenever they chose--so nobody would know she\nhad been to Bath at all.  Such was Bathsheba's scheme.  But in her\ntopographical ignorance as a late comer to the place, she misreckoned\nthe distance of her journey as not much more than half what it really\nwas.\n\nThis idea she proceeded to carry out, with what initial success we\nhave already seen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n\nIN THE SUN--A HARBINGER\n\n\nA week passed, and there were no tidings of Bathsheba; nor was there\nany explanation of her Gilpin's rig.\n\nThen a note came for Maryann, stating that the business which had\ncalled her mistress to Bath still detained her there; but that she\nhoped to return in the course of another week.\n\nAnother week passed.  The oat-harvest began, and all the men were\na-field under a monochromatic Lammas sky, amid the trembling air\nand short shadows of noon.  Indoors nothing was to be heard save\nthe droning of blue-bottle flies; out-of-doors the whetting of\nscythes and the hiss of tressy oat-ears rubbing together as their\nperpendicular stalks of amber-yellow fell heavily to each swath.\nEvery drop of moisture not in the men's bottles and flagons in the\nform of cider was raining as perspiration from their foreheads and\ncheeks.  Drought was everywhere else.\n\nThey were about to withdraw for a while into the charitable shade\nof a tree in the fence, when Coggan saw a figure in a blue coat and\nbrass buttons running to them across the field.\n\n\"I wonder who that is?\" he said.\n\n\"I hope nothing is wrong about mistress,\" said Maryann, who with some\nother women was tying the bundles (oats being always sheafed on this\nfarm), \"but an unlucky token came to me indoors this morning.  I\nwent to unlock the door and dropped the key, and it fell upon the\nstone floor and broke into two pieces.  Breaking a key is a dreadful\nbodement.  I wish mis'ess was home.\"\n\n\"'Tis Cain Ball,\" said Gabriel, pausing from whetting his reaphook.\n\nOak was not bound by his agreement to assist in the corn-field; but\nthe harvest month is an anxious time for a farmer, and the corn was\nBathsheba's, so he lent a hand.\n\n\"He's dressed up in his best clothes,\" said Matthew Moon.  \"He hev\nbeen away from home for a few days, since he's had that felon upon\nhis finger; for 'a said, since I can't work I'll have a hollerday.\"\n\n\"A good time for one--a' excellent time,\" said Joseph Poorgrass,\nstraightening his back; for he, like some of the others, had a way\nof resting a while from his labour on such hot days for reasons\npreternaturally small; of which Cain Ball's advent on a week-day in\nhis Sunday-clothes was one of the first magnitude.  \"Twas a bad leg\nallowed me to read the _Pilgrim's Progress_, and Mark Clark learnt\nAll-Fours in a whitlow.\"\n\n\"Ay, and my father put his arm out of joint to have time to go\ncourting,\" said Jan Coggan, in an eclipsing tone, wiping his face\nwith his shirt-sleeve and thrusting back his hat upon the nape of\nhis neck.\n\nBy this time Cainy was nearing the group of harvesters, and was\nperceived to be carrying a large slice of bread and ham in one hand,\nfrom which he took mouthfuls as he ran, the other being wrapped in a\nbandage.  When he came close, his mouth assumed the bell shape, and\nhe began to cough violently.\n\n\"Now, Cainy!\" said Gabriel, sternly.  \"How many more times must I\ntell you to keep from running so fast when you be eating?  You'll\nchoke yourself some day, that's what you'll do, Cain Ball.\"\n\n\"Hok-hok-hok!\" replied Cain.  \"A crumb of my victuals went the\nwrong way--hok-hok!  That's what 'tis, Mister Oak!  And I've been\nvisiting to Bath because I had a felon on my thumb; yes, and I've\nseen--ahok-hok!\"\n\nDirectly Cain mentioned Bath, they all threw down their hooks and\nforks and drew round him.  Unfortunately the erratic crumb did not\nimprove his narrative powers, and a supplementary hindrance was that\nof a sneeze, jerking from his pocket his rather large watch, which\ndangled in front of the young man pendulum-wise.\n\n\"Yes,\" he continued, directing his thoughts to Bath and letting his\neyes follow, \"I've seed the world at last--yes--and I've seed our\nmis'ess--ahok-hok-hok!\"\n\n\"Bother the boy!\" said Gabriel. \"Something is always going the wrong\nway down your throat, so that you can't tell what's necessary to be\ntold.\"\n\n\"Ahok! there!  Please, Mister Oak, a gnat have just fleed into my\nstomach and brought the cough on again!\"\n\n\"Yes, that's just it.  Your mouth is always open, you young rascal!\"\n\n\"'Tis terrible bad to have a gnat fly down yer throat, pore boy!\"\nsaid Matthew Moon.\n\n\"Well, at Bath you saw--\" prompted Gabriel.\n\n\"I saw our mistress,\" continued the junior shepherd, \"and a sojer,\nwalking along.  And bymeby they got closer and closer, and then they\nwent arm-in-crook, like courting complete--hok-hok! like courting\ncomplete--hok!--courting complete--\"  Losing the thread of his\nnarrative at this point simultaneously with his loss of breath, their\ninformant looked up and down the field apparently for some clue to\nit.  \"Well, I see our mis'ess and a soldier--a-ha-a-wk!\"\n\n\"Damn the boy!\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"'Tis only my manner, Mister Oak, if ye'll excuse it,\" said Cain\nBall, looking reproachfully at Oak, with eyes drenched in their own\ndew.\n\n\"Here's some cider for him--that'll cure his throat,\" said Jan\nCoggan, lifting a flagon of cider, pulling out the cork, and applying\nthe hole to Cainy's mouth; Joseph Poorgrass in the meantime beginning\nto think apprehensively of the serious consequences that would follow\nCainy Ball's strangulation in his cough, and the history of his Bath\nadventures dying with him.\n\n\"For my poor self, I always say 'please God' afore I do anything,\"\nsaid Joseph, in an unboastful voice; \"and so should you, Cain Ball.\n'Tis a great safeguard, and might perhaps save you from being choked\nto death some day.\"\n\nMr. Coggan poured the liquor with unstinted liberality at the\nsuffering Cain's circular mouth; half of it running down the side of\nthe flagon, and half of what reached his mouth running down outside\nhis throat, and half of what ran in going the wrong way, and being\ncoughed and sneezed around the persons of the gathered reapers in the\nform of a cider fog, which for a moment hung in the sunny air like a\nsmall exhalation.\n\n\"There's a great clumsy sneeze!  Why can't ye have better manners,\nyou young dog!\" said Coggan, withdrawing the flagon.\n\n\"The cider went up my nose!\" cried Cainy, as soon as he could speak;\n\"and now 'tis gone down my neck, and into my poor dumb felon, and\nover my shiny buttons and all my best cloze!\"\n\n\"The poor lad's cough is terrible unfortunate,\" said Matthew Moon.\n\"And a great history on hand, too.  Bump his back, shepherd.\"\n\n\"'Tis my nater,\" mourned Cain.  \"Mother says I always was so\nexcitable when my feelings were worked up to a point!\"\n\n\"True, true,\" said Joseph Poorgrass.  \"The Balls were always a very\nexcitable family.  I knowed the boy's grandfather--a truly nervous\nand modest man, even to genteel refinery. 'Twas blush, blush with\nhim, almost as much as 'tis with me--not but that 'tis a fault in\nme!\"\n\n\"Not at all, Master Poorgrass,\" said Coggan.  \"'Tis a very noble\nquality in ye.\"\n\n\"Heh-heh! well, I wish to noise nothing abroad--nothing at all,\"\nmurmured Poorgrass, diffidently.  \"But we be born to things--that's\ntrue.  Yet I would rather my trifle were hid; though, perhaps, a high\nnater is a little high, and at my birth all things were possible to\nmy Maker, and he may have begrudged no gifts....  But under your\nbushel, Joseph! under your bushel with 'ee!  A strange desire,\nneighbours, this desire to hide, and no praise due.  Yet there is a\nSermon on the Mount with a calendar of the blessed at the head, and\ncertain meek men may be named therein.\"\n\n\"Cainy's grandfather was a very clever man,\" said Matthew Moon.\n\"Invented a' apple-tree out of his own head, which is called by his\nname to this day--the Early Ball.  You know 'em, Jan?  A Quarrenden\ngrafted on a Tom Putt, and a Rathe-ripe upon top o' that again.  'Tis\ntrew 'a used to bide about in a public-house wi' a 'ooman in a way he\nhad no business to by rights, but there--'a were a clever man in the\nsense of the term.\"\n\n\"Now then,\" said Gabriel, impatiently, \"what did you see, Cain?\"\n\n\"I seed our mis'ess go into a sort of a park place, where there's\nseats, and shrubs and flowers, arm-in-crook with a sojer,\" continued\nCainy, firmly, and with a dim sense that his words were very\neffective as regarded Gabriel's emotions.  \"And I think the sojer\nwas Sergeant Troy.  And they sat there together for more than\nhalf-an-hour, talking moving things, and she once was crying a'most\nto death. And when they came out her eyes were shining and she was\nas white as a lily; and they looked into one another's faces, as\nfar-gone friendly as a man and woman can be.\"\n\nGabriel's features seemed to get thinner.  \"Well, what did you see\nbesides?\"\n\n\"Oh, all sorts.\"\n\n\"White as a lily?  You are sure 'twas she?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, what besides?\"\n\n\"Great glass windows to the shops, and great clouds in the sky, full\nof rain, and old wooden trees in the country round.\"\n\n\"You stun-poll!  What will ye say next?\" said Coggan.\n\n\"Let en alone,\" interposed Joseph Poorgrass.  \"The boy's meaning is\nthat the sky and the earth in the kingdom of Bath is not altogether\ndifferent from ours here.  'Tis for our good to gain knowledge of\nstrange cities, and as such the boy's words should be suffered, so\nto speak it.\"\n\n\"And the people of Bath,\" continued Cain, \"never need to light their\nfires except as a luxury, for the water springs up out of the earth\nready boiled for use.\"\n\n\"'Tis true as the light,\" testified Matthew Moon. \"I've heard other\nnavigators say the same thing.\"\n\n\"They drink nothing else there,\" said Cain, \"and seem to enjoy it, to\nsee how they swaller it down.\"\n\n\"Well, it seems a barbarian practice enough to us, but I daresay the\nnatives think nothing o' it,\" said Matthew.\n\n\"And don't victuals spring up as well as drink?\" asked Coggan,\ntwirling his eye.\n\n\"No--I own to a blot there in Bath--a true blot.  God didn't provide\n'em with victuals as well as drink, and 'twas a drawback I couldn't\nget over at all.\"\n\n\"Well, 'tis a curious place, to say the least,\" observed Moon; \"and\nit must be a curious people that live therein.\"\n\n\"Miss Everdene and the soldier were walking about together, you say?\"\nsaid Gabriel, returning to the group.\n\n\"Ay, and she wore a beautiful gold-colour silk gown, trimmed with\nblack lace, that would have stood alone 'ithout legs inside if\nrequired.  'Twas a very winsome sight; and her hair was brushed\nsplendid.  And when the sun shone upon the bright gown and his red\ncoat--my! how handsome they looked.  You could see 'em all the\nlength of the street.\"\n\n\"And what then?\" murmured Gabriel.\n\n\"And then I went into Griffin's to hae my boots hobbed, and then I\nwent to Riggs's batty-cake shop, and asked 'em for a penneth of the\ncheapest and nicest stales, that were all but blue-mouldy, but not\nquite.  And whilst I was chawing 'em down I walked on and seed a\nclock with a face as big as a baking trendle--\"\n\n\"But that's nothing to do with mistress!\"\n\n\"I'm coming to that, if you'll leave me alone, Mister Oak!\"\nremonstrated Cainy.  \"If you excites me, perhaps you'll bring on my\ncough, and then I shan't be able to tell ye nothing.\"\n\n\"Yes--let him tell it his own way,\" said Coggan.\n\nGabriel settled into a despairing attitude of patience, and Cainy\nwent on:--\n\n\"And there were great large houses, and more people all the week long\nthan at Weatherbury club-walking on White Tuesdays.  And I went to\ngrand churches and chapels.  And how the parson would pray!  Yes; he\nwould kneel down and put up his hands together, and make the holy\ngold rings on his fingers gleam and twinkle in yer eyes, that he'd\nearned by praying so excellent well!--Ah yes, I wish I lived there.\"\n\n\"Our poor Parson Thirdly can't get no money to buy such rings,\" said\nMatthew Moon, thoughtfully.  \"And as good a man as ever walked.  I\ndon't believe poor Thirdly have a single one, even of humblest tin\nor copper.  Such a great ornament as they'd be to him on a dull\nafternoon, when he's up in the pulpit lighted by the wax candles!\nBut 'tis impossible, poor man.  Ah, to think how unequal things be.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he's made of different stuff than to wear 'em,\" said\nGabriel, grimly. \"Well, that's enough of this.  Go on, Cainy--quick.\"\n\n\"Oh--and the new style of parsons wear moustaches and long beards,\"\ncontinued the illustrious traveller, \"and look like Moses and Aaron\ncomplete, and make we fokes in the congregation feel all over like\nthe children of Israel.\"\n\n\"A very right feeling--very,\" said Joseph Poorgrass.\n\n\"And there's two religions going on in the nation now--High Church\nand High Chapel.  And, thinks I, I'll play fair; so I went to High\nChurch in the morning, and High Chapel in the afternoon.\"\n\n\"A right and proper boy,\" said Joseph Poorgrass.\n\n\"Well, at High Church they pray singing, and worship all the colours\nof the rainbow; and at High Chapel they pray preaching, and worship\ndrab and whitewash only.  And then--I didn't see no more of Miss\nEverdene at all.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you say so afore, then?\" exclaimed Oak, with much\ndisappointment.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Matthew Moon, \"she'll wish her cake dough if so be she's\nover intimate with that man.\"\n\n\"She's not over intimate with him,\" said Gabriel, indignantly.\n\n\"She would know better,\" said Coggan.  \"Our mis'ess has too much\nsense under they knots of black hair to do such a mad thing.\"\n\n\"You see, he's not a coarse, ignorant man, for he was well brought\nup,\" said Matthew, dubiously.  \"'Twas only wildness that made him a\nsoldier, and maids rather like your man of sin.\"\n\n\"Now, Cain Ball,\" said Gabriel restlessly, \"can you swear in the most\nawful form that the woman you saw was Miss Everdene?\"\n\n\"Cain Ball, you be no longer a babe and suckling,\" said Joseph in the\nsepulchral tone the circumstances demanded, \"and you know what taking\nan oath is.  'Tis a horrible testament mind ye, which you say and\nseal with your blood-stone, and the prophet Matthew tells us that on\nwhomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder.  Now, before\nall the work-folk here assembled, can you swear to your words as the\nshepherd asks ye?\"\n\n\"Please no, Mister Oak!\" said Cainy, looking from one to the other\nwith great uneasiness at the spiritual magnitude of the position.  \"I\ndon't mind saying 'tis true, but I don't like to say 'tis damn true,\nif that's what you mane.\"\n\n\"Cain, Cain, how can you!\" asked Joseph sternly.  \"You be asked to\nswear in a holy manner, and you swear like wicked Shimei, the son of\nGera, who cursed as he came.  Young man, fie!\"\n\n\"No, I don't!  'Tis you want to squander a pore boy's soul, Joseph\nPoorgrass--that's what 'tis!\" said Cain, beginning to cry.  \"All I\nmane is that in common truth 'twas Miss Everdene and Sergeant Troy,\nbut in the horrible so-help-me truth that ye want to make of it\nperhaps 'twas somebody else!\"\n\n\"There's no getting at the rights of it,\" said Gabriel, turning to\nhis work.\n\n\"Cain Ball, you'll come to a bit of bread!\" groaned Joseph Poorgrass.\n\nThen the reapers' hooks were flourished again, and the old sounds\nwent on.  Gabriel, without making any pretence of being lively, did\nnothing to show that he was particularly dull.  However, Coggan knew\npretty nearly how the land lay, and when they were in a nook together\nhe said--\n\n\"Don't take on about her, Gabriel.  What difference does it make\nwhose sweetheart she is, since she can't be yours?\"\n\n\"That's the very thing I say to myself,\" said Gabriel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\nHOME AGAIN--A TRICKSTER\n\n\nThat same evening at dusk Gabriel was leaning over Coggan's\ngarden-gate, taking an up-and-down survey before retiring to rest.\n\nA vehicle of some kind was softly creeping along the grassy margin of\nthe lane.  From it spread the tones of two women talking.  The tones\nwere natural and not at all suppressed. Oak instantly knew the voices\nto be those of Bathsheba and Liddy.\n\nThe carriage came opposite and passed by.  It was Miss Everdene's\ngig, and Liddy and her mistress were the only occupants of the seat.\nLiddy was asking questions about the city of Bath, and her companion\nwas answering them listlessly and unconcernedly.  Both Bathsheba and\nthe horse seemed weary.\n\nThe exquisite relief of finding that she was here again, safe and\nsound, overpowered all reflection, and Oak could only luxuriate in\nthe sense of it.  All grave reports were forgotten.\n\nHe lingered and lingered on, till there was no difference between the\neastern and western expanses of sky, and the timid hares began to\nlimp courageously round the dim hillocks.  Gabriel might have been\nthere an additional half-hour when a dark form walked slowly by.\n\"Good-night, Gabriel,\" the passer said.\n\nIt was Boldwood.  \"Good-night, sir,\" said Gabriel.\n\nBoldwood likewise vanished up the road, and Oak shortly afterwards\nturned indoors to bed.\n\nFarmer Boldwood went on towards Miss Everdene's house.  He reached\nthe front, and approaching the entrance, saw a light in the parlour.\nThe blind was not drawn down, and inside the room was Bathsheba,\nlooking over some papers or letters.  Her back was towards Boldwood.\nHe went to the door, knocked, and waited with tense muscles and an\naching brow.\n\nBoldwood had not been outside his garden since his meeting with\nBathsheba in the road to Yalbury.  Silent and alone, he had remained\nin moody meditation on woman's ways, deeming as essentials of the\nwhole sex the accidents of the single one of their number he had ever\nclosely beheld.  By degrees a more charitable temper had pervaded\nhim, and this was the reason of his sally to-night.  He had come to\napologize and beg forgiveness of Bathsheba with something like a\nsense of shame at his violence, having but just now learnt that she\nhad returned--only from a visit to Liddy, as he supposed, the Bath\nescapade being quite unknown to him.\n\nHe inquired for Miss Everdene.  Liddy's manner was odd, but he did\nnot notice it.  She went in, leaving him standing there, and in her\nabsence the blind of the room containing Bathsheba was pulled down.\nBoldwood augured ill from that sign.  Liddy came out.\n\n\"My mistress cannot see you, sir,\" she said.\n\nThe farmer instantly went out by the gate.  He was unforgiven--that\nwas the issue of it all.  He had seen her who was to him\nsimultaneously a delight and a torture, sitting in the room he had\nshared with her as a peculiarly privileged guest only a little\nearlier in the summer, and she had denied him an entrance there now.\n\nBoldwood did not hurry homeward.  It was ten o'clock at least, when,\nwalking deliberately through the lower part of Weatherbury, he heard\nthe carrier's spring van entering the village.  The van ran to and\nfrom a town in a northern direction, and it was owned and driven by\na Weatherbury man, at the door of whose house it now pulled up.  The\nlamp fixed to the head of the hood illuminated a scarlet and gilded\nform, who was the first to alight.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Boldwood to himself, \"come to see her again.\"\n\nTroy entered the carrier's house, which had been the place of his\nlodging on his last visit to his native place.  Boldwood was moved\nby a sudden determination.  He hastened home.  In ten minutes he was\nback again, and made as if he were going to call upon Troy at the\ncarrier's.  But as he approached, some one opened the door and came\nout.  He heard this person say \"Good-night\" to the inmates, and the\nvoice was Troy's.  This was strange, coming so immediately after\nhis arrival.  Boldwood, however, hastened up to him.  Troy had what\nappeared to be a carpet-bag in his hand--the same that he had brought\nwith him.  It seemed as if he were going to leave again this very\nnight.\n\nTroy turned up the hill and quickened his pace.  Boldwood stepped\nforward.\n\n\"Sergeant Troy?\"\n\n\"Yes--I'm Sergeant Troy.\"\n\n\"Just arrived from up the country, I think?\"\n\n\"Just arrived from Bath.\"\n\n\"I am William Boldwood.\"\n\n\"Indeed.\"\n\nThe tone in which this word was uttered was all that had been wanted\nto bring Boldwood to the point.\n\n\"I wish to speak a word with you,\" he said.\n\n\"What about?\"\n\n\"About her who lives just ahead there--and about a woman you have\nwronged.\"\n\n\"I wonder at your impertinence,\" said Troy, moving on.\n\n\"Now look here,\" said Boldwood, standing in front of him, \"wonder or\nnot, you are going to hold a conversation with me.\"\n\nTroy heard the dull determination in Boldwood's voice, looked at his\nstalwart frame, then at the thick cudgel he carried in his hand.  He\nremembered it was past ten o'clock. It seemed worth while to be civil\nto Boldwood.\n\n\"Very well, I'll listen with pleasure,\" said Troy, placing his bag on\nthe ground, \"only speak low, for somebody or other may overhear us in\nthe farmhouse there.\"\n\n\"Well then--I know a good deal concerning your Fanny Robin's\nattachment to you.  I may say, too, that I believe I am the only\nperson in the village, excepting Gabriel Oak, who does know it.  You\nought to marry her.\"\n\n\"I suppose I ought.  Indeed, I wish to, but I cannot.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nTroy was about to utter something hastily; he then checked himself\nand said, \"I am too poor.\"  His voice was changed.  Previously it had\nhad a devil-may-care tone.  It was the voice of a trickster now.\n\nBoldwood's present mood was not critical enough to notice tones.  He\ncontinued, \"I may as well speak plainly; and understand, I don't\nwish to enter into the questions of right or wrong, woman's honour\nand shame, or to express any opinion on your conduct.  I intend a\nbusiness transaction with you.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Troy.  \"Suppose we sit down here.\"\n\nAn old tree trunk lay under the hedge immediately opposite, and they\nsat down.\n\n\"I was engaged to be married to Miss Everdene,\" said Boldwood, \"but\nyou came and--\"\n\n\"Not engaged,\" said Troy.\n\n\"As good as engaged.\"\n\n\"If I had not turned up she might have become engaged to you.\"\n\n\"Hang might!\"\n\n\"Would, then.\"\n\n\"If you had not come I should certainly--yes, CERTAINLY--have been\naccepted by this time.  If you had not seen her you might have been\nmarried to Fanny.  Well, there's too much difference between Miss\nEverdene's station and your own for this flirtation with her ever to\nbenefit you by ending in marriage.  So all I ask is, don't molest her\nany more. Marry Fanny.  I'll make it worth your while.\"\n\n\"How will you?\"\n\n\"I'll pay you well now, I'll settle a sum of money upon her, and\nI'll see that you don't suffer from poverty in the future.  I'll put\nit clearly.  Bathsheba is only playing with you: you are too poor\nfor her as I said; so give up wasting your time about a great match\nyou'll never make for a moderate and rightful match you may make\nto-morrow; take up your carpet-bag, turn about, leave Weatherbury\nnow, this night, and you shall take fifty pounds with you.  Fanny\nshall have fifty to enable her to prepare for the wedding, when you\nhave told me where she is living, and she shall have five hundred\npaid down on her wedding-day.\"\n\nIn making this statement Boldwood's voice revealed only too clearly\na consciousness of the weakness of his position, his aims, and his\nmethod.  His manner had lapsed quite from that of the firm and\ndignified Boldwood of former times; and such a scheme as he had now\nengaged in he would have condemned as childishly imbecile only a few\nmonths ago.  We discern a grand force in the lover which he lacks\nwhilst a free man; but there is a breadth of vision in the free\nman which in the lover we vainly seek.  Where there is much bias\nthere must be some narrowness, and love, though added emotion, is\nsubtracted capacity.  Boldwood exemplified this to an abnormal\ndegree: he knew nothing of Fanny Robin's circumstances or\nwhereabouts, he knew nothing of Troy's possibilities, yet that was\nwhat he said.\n\n\"I like Fanny best,\" said Troy; \"and if, as you say, Miss Everdene is\nout of my reach, why I have all to gain by accepting your money, and\nmarrying Fan.  But she's only a servant.\"\n\n\"Never mind--do you agree to my arrangement?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Boldwood, in a more elastic voice.  \"Oh, Troy, if you like\nher best, why then did you step in here and injure my happiness?\"\n\n\"I love Fanny best now,\" said Troy.  \"But Bathsh--Miss Everdene\ninflamed me, and displaced Fanny for a time.  It is over now.\"\n\n\"Why should it be over so soon?  And why then did you come here\nagain?\"\n\n\"There are weighty reasons.  Fifty pounds at once, you said!\"\n\n\"I did,\" said Boldwood, \"and here they are--fifty sovereigns.\" He\nhanded Troy a small packet.\n\n\"You have everything ready--it seems that you calculated on my\naccepting them,\" said the sergeant, taking the packet.\n\n\"I thought you might accept them,\" said Boldwood.\n\n\"You've only my word that the programme shall be adhered to, whilst\nI at any rate have fifty pounds.\"\n\n\"I had thought of that, and I have considered that if I can't appeal\nto your honour I can trust to your--well, shrewdness we'll call\nit--not to lose five hundred pounds in prospect, and also make a\nbitter enemy of a man who is willing to be an extremely useful\nfriend.\"\n\n\"Stop, listen!\" said Troy in a whisper.\n\nA light pit-pat was audible upon the road just above them.\n\n\"By George--'tis she,\" he continued.  \"I must go on and meet her.\"\n\n\"She--who?\"\n\n\"Bathsheba.\"\n\n\"Bathsheba--out alone at this time o' night!\" said Boldwood in\namazement, and starting up. \"Why must you meet her?\"\n\n\"She was expecting me to-night--and I must now speak to her, and wish\nher good-bye, according to your wish.\"\n\n\"I don't see the necessity of speaking.\"\n\n\"It can do no harm--and she'll be wandering about looking for me if\nI don't.  You shall hear all I say to her.  It will help you in your\nlove-making when I am gone.\"\n\n\"Your tone is mocking.\"\n\n\"Oh no.  And remember this, if she does not know what has become of\nme, she will think more about me than if I tell her flatly I have\ncome to give her up.\"\n\n\"Will you confine your words to that one point?--Shall I hear every\nword you say?\"\n\n\"Every word.  Now sit still there, and hold my carpet bag for me, and\nmark what you hear.\"\n\nThe light footstep came closer, halting occasionally, as if the\nwalker listened for a sound.  Troy whistled a double note in a soft,\nfluty tone.\n\n\"Come to that, is it!\" murmured Boldwood, uneasily.\n\n\"You promised silence,\" said Troy.\n\n\"I promise again.\"\n\nTroy stepped forward.\n\n\"Frank, dearest, is that you?\" The tones were Bathsheba's.\n\n\"O God!\" said Boldwood.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Troy to her.\n\n\"How late you are,\" she continued, tenderly.  \"Did you come by the\ncarrier?  I listened and heard his wheels entering the village, but\nit was some time ago, and I had almost given you up, Frank.\"\n\n\"I was sure to come,\" said Frank.  \"You knew I should, did you not?\"\n\n\"Well, I thought you would,\" she said, playfully; \"and, Frank, it\nis so lucky!  There's not a soul in my house but me to-night.  I've\npacked them all off so nobody on earth will know of your visit to\nyour lady's bower.  Liddy wanted to go to her grandfather's to tell\nhim about her holiday, and I said she might stay with them till\nto-morrow--when you'll be gone again.\"\n\n\"Capital,\" said Troy.  \"But, dear me, I had better go back for my\nbag, because my slippers and brush and comb are in it; you run home\nwhilst I fetch it, and I'll promise to be in your parlour in ten\nminutes.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" She turned and tripped up the hill again.\n\nDuring the progress of this dialogue there was a nervous twitching\nof Boldwood's tightly closed lips, and his face became bathed in a\nclammy dew.  He now started forward towards Troy.  Troy turned to\nhim and took up the bag.\n\n\"Shall I tell her I have come to give her up and cannot marry her?\"\nsaid the soldier, mockingly.\n\n\"No, no; wait a minute.  I want to say more to you--more to you!\"\nsaid Boldwood, in a hoarse whisper.\n\n\"Now,\" said Troy, \"you see my dilemma.  Perhaps I am a bad man--the\nvictim of my impulses--led away to do what I ought to leave undone.\nI can't, however, marry them both.  And I have two reasons for\nchoosing Fanny.  First, I like her best upon the whole, and second,\nyou make it worth my while.\"\n\nAt the same instant Boldwood sprang upon him, and held him by the\nneck.  Troy felt Boldwood's grasp slowly tightening. The move was\nabsolutely unexpected.\n\n\"A moment,\" he gasped.  \"You are injuring her you love!\"\n\n\"Well, what do you mean?\" said the farmer.\n\n\"Give me breath,\" said Troy.\n\nBoldwood loosened his hand, saying, \"By Heaven, I've a mind to kill\nyou!\"\n\n\"And ruin her.\"\n\n\"Save her.\"\n\n\"Oh, how can she be saved now, unless I marry her?\"\n\nBoldwood groaned.  He reluctantly released the soldier, and flung him\nback against the hedge.  \"Devil, you torture me!\" said he.\n\nTroy rebounded like a ball, and was about to make a dash at the\nfarmer; but he checked himself, saying lightly--\n\n\"It is not worth while to measure my strength with you.  Indeed it\nis a barbarous way of settling a quarrel.  I shall shortly leave the\narmy because of the same conviction.  Now after that revelation of\nhow the land lies with Bathsheba, 'twould be a mistake to kill me,\nwould it not?\"\n\n\"'Twould be a mistake to kill you,\" repeated Boldwood, mechanically,\nwith a bowed head.\n\n\"Better kill yourself.\"\n\n\"Far better.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you see it.\"\n\n\"Troy, make her your wife, and don't act upon what I arranged just\nnow.  The alternative is dreadful, but take Bathsheba; I give her up!\nShe must love you indeed to sell soul and body to you so utterly as\nshe has done.  Wretched woman--deluded woman--you are, Bathsheba!\"\n\n\"But about Fanny?\"\n\n\"Bathsheba is a woman well to do,\" continued Boldwood, in nervous\nanxiety, \"and, Troy, she will make a good wife; and, indeed, she is\nworth your hastening on your marriage with her!\"\n\n\"But she has a will--not to say a temper, and I shall be a mere slave\nto her.  I could do anything with poor Fanny Robin.\"\n\n\"Troy,\" said Boldwood, imploringly, \"I'll do anything for you, only\ndon't desert her; pray don't desert her, Troy.\"\n\n\"Which, poor Fanny?\"\n\n\"No; Bathsheba Everdene.  Love her best!  Love her tenderly!  How\nshall I get you to see how advantageous it will be to you to secure\nher at once?\"\n\n\"I don't wish to secure her in any new way.\"\n\nBoldwood's arm moved spasmodically towards Troy's person again.  He\nrepressed the instinct, and his form drooped as with pain.\n\nTroy went on--\n\n\"I shall soon purchase my discharge, and then--\"\n\n\"But I wish you to hasten on this marriage!  It will be better for\nyou both.  You love each other, and you must let me help you to do\nit.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Why, by settling the five hundred on Bathsheba instead of Fanny, to\nenable you to marry at once.  No; she wouldn't have it of me.  I'll\npay it down to you on the wedding-day.\"\n\nTroy paused in secret amazement at Boldwood's wild infatuation.  He\ncarelessly said, \"And am I to have anything now?\"\n\n\"Yes, if you wish to.  But I have not much additional money with me.\nI did not expect this; but all I have is yours.\"\n\nBoldwood, more like a somnambulist than a wakeful man, pulled out the\nlarge canvas bag he carried by way of a purse, and searched it.\n\n\"I have twenty-one pounds more with me,\" he said.  \"Two notes and a\nsovereign.  But before I leave you I must have a paper signed--\"\n\n\"Pay me the money, and we'll go straight to her parlour, and make any\narrangement you please to secure my compliance with your wishes.  But\nshe must know nothing of this cash business.\"\n\n\"Nothing, nothing,\" said Boldwood, hastily.  \"Here is the sum, and\nif you'll come to my house we'll write out the agreement for the\nremainder, and the terms also.\"\n\n\"First we'll call upon her.\"\n\n\"But why?  Come with me to-night, and go with me to-morrow to the\nsurrogate's.\"\n\n\"But she must be consulted; at any rate informed.\"\n\n\"Very well; go on.\"\n\nThey went up the hill to Bathsheba's house.  When they stood at the\nentrance, Troy said, \"Wait here a moment.\"  Opening the door, he\nglided inside, leaving the door ajar.\n\nBoldwood waited.  In two minutes a light appeared in the passage.\nBoldwood then saw that the chain had been fastened across the door.\nTroy appeared inside, carrying a bedroom candlestick.\n\n\"What, did you think I should break in?\" said Boldwood,\ncontemptuously.\n\n\"Oh, no, it is merely my humour to secure things.  Will you read this\na moment?  I'll hold the light.\"\n\nTroy handed a folded newspaper through the slit between door and\ndoorpost, and put the candle close.  \"That's the paragraph,\" he said,\nplacing his finger on a line.\n\nBoldwood looked and read--\n\n\n   MARRIAGES.\n\n   On the 17th inst., at St. Ambrose's Church, Bath, by the\n   Rev. G. Mincing, B.A., Francis Troy, only son of the late\n   Edward Troy, Esq., M.D., of Weatherbury, and sergeant with\n   Dragoon Guards, to Bathsheba, only surviving daughter of\n   the late Mr. John Everdene, of Casterbridge.\n\n\n\"This may be called Fort meeting Feeble, hey, Boldwood?\" said Troy.\nA low gurgle of derisive laughter followed the words.\n\nThe paper fell from Boldwood's hands.  Troy continued--\n\n\"Fifty pounds to marry Fanny.  Good.  Twenty-one pounds not to marry\nFanny, but Bathsheba.  Good.  Finale: already Bathsheba's husband.\nNow, Boldwood, yours is the ridiculous fate which always attends\ninterference between a man and his wife.  And another word.  Bad as I\nam, I am not such a villain as to make the marriage or misery of any\nwoman a matter of huckster and sale.  Fanny has long ago left me.  I\ndon't know where she is.  I have searched everywhere.  Another word\nyet.  You say you love Bathsheba; yet on the merest apparent evidence\nyou instantly believe in her dishonour.  A fig for such love!  Now\nthat I've taught you a lesson, take your money back again.\"\n\n\"I will not; I will not!\" said Boldwood, in a hiss.\n\n\"Anyhow I won't have it,\" said Troy, contemptuously.  He wrapped the\npacket of gold in the notes, and threw the whole into the road.\n\nBoldwood shook his clenched fist at him.  \"You juggler of Satan!  You\nblack hound!  But I'll punish you yet; mark me, I'll punish you yet!\"\n\nAnother peal of laughter.  Troy then closed the door, and locked\nhimself in.\n\nThroughout the whole of that night Boldwood's dark form might have\nbeen seen walking about the hills and downs of Weatherbury like an\nunhappy Shade in the Mournful Fields by Acheron.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\n\nAT AN UPPER WINDOW\n\n\nIt was very early the next morning--a time of sun and dew.  The\nconfused beginnings of many birds' songs spread into the healthy air,\nand the wan blue of the heaven was here and there coated with thin\nwebs of incorporeal cloud which were of no effect in obscuring day.\nAll the lights in the scene were yellow as to colour, and all the\nshadows were attenuated as to form.  The creeping plants about the\nold manor-house were bowed with rows of heavy water drops, which\nhad upon objects behind them the effect of minute lenses of high\nmagnifying power.\n\nJust before the clock struck five Gabriel Oak and Coggan passed the\nvillage cross, and went on together to the fields.  They were yet\nbarely in view of their mistress's house, when Oak fancied he saw the\nopening of a casement in one of the upper windows.  The two men were\nat this moment partially screened by an elder bush, now beginning\nto be enriched with black bunches of fruit, and they paused before\nemerging from its shade.\n\nA handsome man leaned idly from the lattice.  He looked east and then\nwest, in the manner of one who makes a first morning survey.  The\nman was Sergeant Troy.  His red jacket was loosely thrown on, but\nnot buttoned, and he had altogether the relaxed bearing of a soldier\ntaking his ease.\n\nCoggan spoke first, looking quietly at the window.\n\n\"She has married him!\" he said.\n\nGabriel had previously beheld the sight, and he now stood with his\nback turned, making no reply.\n\n\"I fancied we should know something to-day,\" continued Coggan.  \"I\nheard wheels pass my door just after dark--you were out somewhere.\"\nHe glanced round upon Gabriel.  \"Good heavens above us, Oak, how\nwhite your face is; you look like a corpse!\"\n\n\"Do I?\" said Oak, with a faint smile.\n\n\"Lean on the gate: I'll wait a bit.\"\n\n\"All right, all right.\"\n\nThey stood by the gate awhile, Gabriel listlessly staring at the\nground.  His mind sped into the future, and saw there enacted in\nyears of leisure the scenes of repentance that would ensue from this\nwork of haste.  That they were married he had instantly decided.  Why\nhad it been so mysteriously managed?  It had become known that she\nhad had a fearful journey to Bath, owing to her miscalculating the\ndistance: that the horse had broken down, and that she had been more\nthan two days getting there.  It was not Bathsheba's way to do things\nfurtively.  With all her faults, she was candour itself.  Could she\nhave been entrapped?  The union was not only an unutterable grief to\nhim: it amazed him, notwithstanding that he had passed the preceding\nweek in a suspicion that such might be the issue of Troy's meeting\nher away from home.  Her quiet return with Liddy had to some extent\ndispersed the dread.  Just as that imperceptible motion which appears\nlike stillness is infinitely divided in its properties from stillness\nitself, so had his hope undistinguishable from despair differed from\ndespair indeed.\n\nIn a few minutes they moved on again towards the house.  The sergeant\nstill looked from the window.\n\n\"Morning, comrades!\" he shouted, in a cheery voice, when they came\nup.\n\nCoggan replied to the greeting.  \"Bain't ye going to answer the man?\"\nhe then said to Gabriel.  \"I'd say good morning--you needn't spend a\nhapenny of meaning upon it, and yet keep the man civil.\"\n\nGabriel soon decided too that, since the deed was done, to put the\nbest face upon the matter would be the greatest kindness to her he\nloved.\n\n\"Good morning, Sergeant Troy,\" he returned, in a ghastly voice.\n\n\"A rambling, gloomy house this,\" said Troy, smiling.\n\n\"Why--they MAY not be married!\" suggested Coggan.  \"Perhaps she's not\nthere.\"\n\nGabriel shook his head.  The soldier turned a little towards the\neast, and the sun kindled his scarlet coat to an orange glow.\n\n\"But it is a nice old house,\" responded Gabriel.\n\n\"Yes--I suppose so; but I feel like new wine in an old bottle here.\nMy notion is that sash-windows should be put throughout, and these\nold wainscoted walls brightened up a bit; or the oak cleared quite\naway, and the walls papered.\"\n\n\"It would be a pity, I think.\"\n\n\"Well, no.  A philosopher once said in my hearing that the old\nbuilders, who worked when art was a living thing, had no respect\nfor the work of builders who went before them, but pulled down and\naltered as they thought fit; and why shouldn't we?  'Creation and\npreservation don't do well together,' says he, 'and a million of\nantiquarians can't invent a style.' My mind exactly.  I am for making\nthis place more modern, that we may be cheerful whilst we can.\"\n\nThe military man turned and surveyed the interior of the room, to\nassist his ideas of improvement in this direction.  Gabriel and\nCoggan began to move on.\n\n\"Oh, Coggan,\" said Troy, as if inspired by a recollection \"do you\nknow if insanity has ever appeared in Mr. Boldwood's family?\"\n\nJan reflected for a moment.\n\n\"I once heard that an uncle of his was queer in his head, but I don't\nknow the rights o't,\" he said.\n\n\"It is of no importance,\" said Troy, lightly.  \"Well, I shall be down\nin the fields with you some time this week; but I have a few matters\nto attend to first.  So good-day to you.  We shall, of course, keep\non just as friendly terms as usual.  I'm not a proud man: nobody is\never able to say that of Sergeant Troy.  However, what is must be,\nand here's half-a-crown to drink my health, men.\"\n\nTroy threw the coin dexterously across the front plot and over the\nfence towards Gabriel, who shunned it in its fall, his face turning\nto an angry red.  Coggan twirled his eye, edged forward, and caught\nthe money in its ricochet upon the road.\n\n\"Very well--you keep it, Coggan,\" said Gabriel with disdain and\nalmost fiercely.  \"As for me, I'll do without gifts from him!\"\n\n\"Don't show it too much,\" said Coggan, musingly.  \"For if he's\nmarried to her, mark my words, he'll buy his discharge and be our\nmaster here.  Therefore 'tis well to say 'Friend' outwardly, though\nyou say 'Troublehouse' within.\"\n\n\"Well--perhaps it is best to be silent; but I can't go further than\nthat.  I can't flatter, and if my place here is only to be kept by\nsmoothing him down, my place must be lost.\"\n\nA horseman, whom they had for some time seen in the distance, now\nappeared close beside them.\n\n\"There's Mr. Boldwood,\" said Oak.  \"I wonder what Troy meant by his\nquestion.\"\n\nCoggan and Oak nodded respectfully to the farmer, just checked their\npaces to discover if they were wanted, and finding they were not\nstood back to let him pass on.\n\nThe only signs of the terrible sorrow Boldwood had been combating\nthrough the night, and was combating now, were the want of colour\nin his well-defined face, the enlarged appearance of the veins in\nhis forehead and temples, and the sharper lines about his mouth.\nThe horse bore him away, and the very step of the animal seemed\nsignificant of dogged despair.  Gabriel, for a minute, rose above his\nown grief in noticing Boldwood's.  He saw the square figure sitting\nerect upon the horse, the head turned to neither side, the elbows\nsteady by the hips, the brim of the hat level and undisturbed in\nits onward glide, until the keen edges of Boldwood's shape sank by\ndegrees over the hill.  To one who knew the man and his story there\nwas something more striking in this immobility than in a collapse.\nThe clash of discord between mood and matter here was forced\npainfully home to the heart; and, as in laughter there are more\ndreadful phases than in tears, so was there in the steadiness of\nthis agonized man an expression deeper than a cry.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\n\nWEALTH IN JEOPARDY--THE REVEL\n\n\nOne night, at the end of August, when Bathsheba's experiences as a\nmarried woman were still new, and when the weather was yet dry and\nsultry, a man stood motionless in the stockyard of Weatherbury Upper\nFarm, looking at the moon and sky.\n\nThe night had a sinister aspect.  A heated breeze from the south\nslowly fanned the summits of lofty objects, and in the sky dashes\nof buoyant cloud were sailing in a course at right angles to that\nof another stratum, neither of them in the direction of the breeze\nbelow.  The moon, as seen through these films, had a lurid metallic\nlook.  The fields were sallow with the impure light, and all were\ntinged in monochrome, as if beheld through stained glass.  The same\nevening the sheep had trailed homeward head to tail, the behaviour of\nthe rooks had been confused, and the horses had moved with timidity\nand caution.\n\nThunder was imminent, and, taking some secondary appearances into\nconsideration, it was likely to be followed by one of the lengthened\nrains which mark the close of dry weather for the season.  Before\ntwelve hours had passed a harvest atmosphere would be a bygone thing.\n\nOak gazed with misgiving at eight naked and unprotected ricks,\nmassive and heavy with the rich produce of one-half the farm for\nthat year.  He went on to the barn.\n\nThis was the night which had been selected by Sergeant Troy--ruling\nnow in the room of his wife--for giving the harvest supper and dance.\nAs Oak approached the building the sound of violins and a tambourine,\nand the regular jigging of many feet, grew more distinct.  He came\nclose to the large doors, one of which stood slightly ajar, and\nlooked in.\n\nThe central space, together with the recess at one end, was emptied\nof all incumbrances, and this area, covering about two-thirds of\nthe whole, was appropriated for the gathering, the remaining end,\nwhich was piled to the ceiling with oats, being screened off with\nsail-cloth.  Tufts and garlands of green foliage decorated the walls,\nbeams, and extemporized chandeliers, and immediately opposite to Oak\na rostrum had been erected, bearing a table and chairs.  Here sat\nthree fiddlers, and beside them stood a frantic man with his hair\non end, perspiration streaming down his cheeks, and a tambourine\nquivering in his hand.\n\nThe dance ended, and on the black oak floor in the midst a new row of\ncouples formed for another.\n\n\"Now, ma'am, and no offence I hope, I ask what dance you would like\nnext?\" said the first violin.\n\n\"Really, it makes no difference,\" said the clear voice of Bathsheba,\nwho stood at the inner end of the building, observing the scene from\nbehind a table covered with cups and viands.  Troy was lolling beside\nher.\n\n\"Then,\" said the fiddler, \"I'll venture to name that the right and\nproper thing is 'The Soldier's Joy'--there being a gallant soldier\nmarried into the farm--hey, my sonnies, and gentlemen all?\"\n\n\"It shall be 'The Soldier's Joy,'\" exclaimed a chorus.\n\n\"Thanks for the compliment,\" said the sergeant gaily, taking\nBathsheba by the hand and leading her to the top of the dance.  \"For\nthough I have purchased my discharge from Her Most Gracious Majesty's\nregiment of cavalry the 11th Dragoon Guards, to attend to the new\nduties awaiting me here, I shall continue a soldier in spirit and\nfeeling as long as I live.\"\n\nSo the dance began.  As to the merits of \"The Soldier's Joy,\" there\ncannot be, and never were, two opinions.  It has been observed in the\nmusical circles of Weatherbury and its vicinity that this melody, at\nthe end of three-quarters of an hour of thunderous footing, still\npossesses more stimulative properties for the heel and toe than the\nmajority of other dances at their first opening.  \"The Soldier's Joy\"\nhas, too, an additional charm, in being so admirably adapted to the\ntambourine aforesaid--no mean instrument in the hands of a performer\nwho understands the proper convulsions, spasms, St. Vitus's dances,\nand fearful frenzies necessary when exhibiting its tones in their\nhighest perfection.\n\nThe immortal tune ended, a fine DD rolling forth from the bass-viol\nwith the sonorousness of a cannonade, and Gabriel delayed his entry\nno longer.  He avoided Bathsheba, and got as near as possible\nto the platform, where Sergeant Troy was now seated, drinking\nbrandy-and-water, though the others drank without exception cider and\nale. Gabriel could not easily thrust himself within speaking distance\nof the sergeant, and he sent a message, asking him to come down for a\nmoment.  The sergeant said he could not attend.\n\n\"Will you tell him, then,\" said Gabriel, \"that I only stepped ath'art\nto say that a heavy rain is sure to fall soon, and that something\nshould be done to protect the ricks?\"\n\n\"Mr. Troy says it will not rain,\" returned the messenger, \"and he\ncannot stop to talk to you about such fidgets.\"\n\nIn juxtaposition with Troy, Oak had a melancholy tendency to look\nlike a candle beside gas, and ill at ease, he went out again,\nthinking he would go home; for, under the circumstances, he had no\nheart for the scene in the barn.  At the door he paused for a moment:\nTroy was speaking.\n\n\"Friends, it is not only the harvest home that we are celebrating\nto-night; but this is also a Wedding Feast.  A short time ago I had\nthe happiness to lead to the altar this lady, your mistress, and not\nuntil now have we been able to give any public flourish to the event\nin Weatherbury.  That it may be thoroughly well done, and that every\nman may go happy to bed, I have ordered to be brought here some\nbottles of brandy and kettles of hot water.  A treble-strong goblet\nwill be handed round to each guest.\"\n\nBathsheba put her hand upon his arm, and, with upturned pale face,\nsaid imploringly, \"No--don't give it to them--pray don't, Frank!  It\nwill only do them harm: they have had enough of everything.\"\n\n\"True--we don't wish for no more, thank ye,\" said one or two.\n\n\"Pooh!\" said the sergeant contemptuously, and raised his voice as\nif lighted up by a new idea.  \"Friends,\" he said, \"we'll send the\nwomen-folk home!  'Tis time they were in bed.  Then we cockbirds will\nhave a jolly carouse to ourselves!  If any of the men show the white\nfeather, let them look elsewhere for a winter's work.\"\n\nBathsheba indignantly left the barn, followed by all the women and\nchildren.  The musicians, not looking upon themselves as \"company,\"\nslipped quietly away to their spring waggon and put in the horse.\nThus Troy and the men on the farm were left sole occupants of the\nplace.  Oak, not to appear unnecessarily disagreeable, stayed a\nlittle while; then he, too, arose and quietly took his departure,\nfollowed by a friendly oath from the sergeant for not staying to a\nsecond round of grog.\n\nGabriel proceeded towards his home.  In approaching the door, his\ntoe kicked something which felt and sounded soft, leathery, and\ndistended, like a boxing-glove.  It was a large toad humbly\ntravelling across the path.  Oak took it up, thinking it might be\nbetter to kill the creature to save it from pain; but finding it\nuninjured, he placed it again among the grass.  He knew what this\ndirect message from the Great Mother meant.  And soon came another.\n\nWhen he struck a light indoors there appeared upon the table a thin\nglistening streak, as if a brush of varnish had been lightly dragged\nacross it.  Oak's eyes followed the serpentine sheen to the other\nside, where it led up to a huge brown garden-slug, which had come\nindoors to-night for reasons of its own.  It was Nature's second way\nof hinting to him that he was to prepare for foul weather.\n\nOak sat down meditating for nearly an hour.  During this time two\nblack spiders, of the kind common in thatched houses, promenaded the\nceiling, ultimately dropping to the floor.  This reminded him that\nif there was one class of manifestation on this matter that he\nthoroughly understood, it was the instincts of sheep.  He left the\nroom, ran across two or three fields towards the flock, got upon a\nhedge, and looked over among them.\n\nThey were crowded close together on the other side around some furze\nbushes, and the first peculiarity observable was that, on the sudden\nappearance of Oak's head over the fence, they did not stir or run\naway.  They had now a terror of something greater than their terror\nof man.  But this was not the most noteworthy feature: they were all\ngrouped in such a way that their tails, without a single exception,\nwere towards that half of the horizon from which the storm\nthreatened.  There was an inner circle closely huddled, and outside\nthese they radiated wider apart, the pattern formed by the flock as a\nwhole not being unlike a vandyked lace collar, to which the clump of\nfurze-bushes stood in the position of a wearer's neck.\n\nThis was enough to re-establish him in his original opinion.  He knew\nnow that he was right, and that Troy was wrong. Every voice in nature\nwas unanimous in bespeaking change.  But two distinct translations\nattached to these dumb expressions.  Apparently there was to be a\nthunder-storm, and afterwards a cold continuous rain.  The creeping\nthings seemed to know all about the later rain, but little of the\ninterpolated thunder-storm; whilst the sheep knew all about the\nthunder-storm and nothing of the later rain.\n\nThis complication of weathers being uncommon, was all the more to be\nfeared.  Oak returned to the stack-yard.  All was silent here, and\nthe conical tips of the ricks jutted darkly into the sky.  There were\nfive wheat-ricks in this yard, and three stacks of barley.  The wheat\nwhen threshed would average about thirty quarters to each stack; the\nbarley, at least forty.  Their value to Bathsheba, and indeed to\nanybody, Oak mentally estimated by the following simple\ncalculation:--\n\n\n      5 x 30 = 150 quarters = 500 L.\n      3 x 40 = 120 quarters = 250 L.\n                            -------\n                    Total . . 750 L.\n\n\nSeven hundred and fifty pounds in the divinest form that money can\nwear--that of necessary food for man and beast: should the risk be\nrun of deteriorating this bulk of corn to less than half its value,\nbecause of the instability of a woman?  \"Never, if I can prevent it!\"\nsaid Gabriel.\n\nSuch was the argument that Oak set outwardly before him.  But man,\neven to himself, is a palimpsest, having an ostensible writing, and\nanother beneath the lines.  It is possible that there was this golden\nlegend under the utilitarian one: \"I will help to my last effort the\nwoman I have loved so dearly.\"\n\nHe went back to the barn to endeavour to obtain assistance for\ncovering the ricks that very night.  All was silent within, and he\nwould have passed on in the belief that the party had broken up, had\nnot a dim light, yellow as saffron by contrast with the greenish\nwhiteness outside, streamed through a knot-hole in the folding doors.\n\nGabriel looked in.  An unusual picture met his eye.\n\nThe candles suspended among the evergreens had burnt down to their\nsockets, and in some cases the leaves tied about them were scorched.\nMany of the lights had quite gone out, others smoked and stank,\ngrease dropping from them upon the floor.  Here, under the table, and\nleaning against forms and chairs in every conceivable attitude except\nthe perpendicular, were the wretched persons of all the work-folk,\nthe hair of their heads at such low levels being suggestive of mops\nand brooms.  In the midst of these shone red and distinct the figure\nof Sergeant Troy, leaning back in a chair.  Coggan was on his back,\nwith his mouth open, huzzing forth snores, as were several others;\nthe united breathings of the horizonal assemblage forming a subdued\nroar like London from a distance.  Joseph Poorgrass was curled round\nin the fashion of a hedge-hog, apparently in attempts to present the\nleast possible portion of his surface to the air; and behind him\nwas dimly visible an unimportant remnant of William Smallbury.\nThe glasses and cups still stood upon the table, a water-jug being\noverturned, from which a small rill, after tracing its course with\nmarvellous precision down the centre of the long table, fell into the\nneck of the unconscious Mark Clark, in a steady, monotonous drip,\nlike the dripping of a stalactite in a cave.\n\nGabriel glanced hopelessly at the group, which, with one or two\nexceptions, composed all the able-bodied men upon the farm.  He saw\nat once that if the ricks were to be saved that night, or even the\nnext morning, he must save them with his own hands.\n\nA faint \"ting-ting\" resounded from under Coggan's waistcoat.  It was\nCoggan's watch striking the hour of two.\n\nOak went to the recumbent form of Matthew Moon, who usually undertook\nthe rough thatching of the home-stead, and shook him.  The shaking\nwas without effect.\n\nGabriel shouted in his ear, \"where's your thatching-beetle and\nrick-stick and spars?\"\n\n\"Under the staddles,\" said Moon, mechanically, with the unconscious\npromptness of a medium.\n\nGabriel let go his head, and it dropped upon the floor like a bowl.\nHe then went to Susan Tall's husband.\n\n\"Where's the key of the granary?\"\n\nNo answer.  The question was repeated, with the same result.  To be\nshouted to at night was evidently less of a novelty to Susan Tall's\nhusband than to Matthew Moon.  Oak flung down Tall's head into the\ncorner again and turned away.\n\nTo be just, the men were not greatly to blame for this painful and\ndemoralizing termination to the evening's entertainment.  Sergeant\nTroy had so strenuously insisted, glass in hand, that drinking should\nbe the bond of their union, that those who wished to refuse hardly\nliked to be so unmannerly under the circumstances.  Having from their\nyouth up been entirely unaccustomed to any liquor stronger than cider\nor mild ale, it was no wonder that they had succumbed, one and all,\nwith extraordinary uniformity, after the lapse of about an hour.\n\nGabriel was greatly depressed.  This debauch boded ill for that\nwilful and fascinating mistress whom the faithful man even now felt\nwithin him as the embodiment of all that was sweet and bright and\nhopeless.\n\nHe put out the expiring lights, that the barn might not be\nendangered, closed the door upon the men in their deep and oblivious\nsleep, and went again into the lone night.  A hot breeze, as if\nbreathed from the parted lips of some dragon about to swallow the\nglobe, fanned him from the south, while directly opposite in the\nnorth rose a grim misshapen body of cloud, in the very teeth of the\nwind.  So unnaturally did it rise that one could fancy it to be\nlifted by machinery from below.  Meanwhile the faint cloudlets had\nflown back into the south-east corner of the sky, as if in terror of\nthe large cloud, like a young brood gazed in upon by some monster.\n\nGoing on to the village, Oak flung a small stone against the window\nof Laban Tall's bedroom, expecting Susan to open it; but nobody\nstirred.  He went round to the back door, which had been left\nunfastened for Laban's entry, and passed in to the foot of the\nstaircase.\n\n\"Mrs. Tall, I've come for the key of the granary, to get at the\nrick-cloths,\" said Oak, in a stentorian voice.\n\n\"Is that you?\" said Mrs. Susan Tall, half awake.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"Come along to bed, do, you drawlatching rogue--keeping a body awake\nlike this!\"\n\n\"It isn't Laban--'tis Gabriel Oak.  I want the key of the granary.\"\n\n\"Gabriel!  What in the name of fortune did you pretend to be Laban\nfor?\"\n\n\"I didn't.  I thought you meant--\"\n\n\"Yes you did!  What do you want here?\"\n\n\"The key of the granary.\"\n\n\"Take it then.  'Tis on the nail.  People coming disturbing women at\nthis time of night ought--\"\n\nGabriel took the key, without waiting to hear the conclusion of the\ntirade.  Ten minutes later his lonely figure might have been seen\ndragging four large water-proof coverings across the yard, and soon\ntwo of these heaps of treasure in grain were covered snug--two cloths\nto each.  Two hundred pounds were secured.  Three wheat-stacks\nremained open, and there were no more cloths.  Oak looked under the\nstaddles and found a fork.  He mounted the third pile of wealth and\nbegan operating, adopting the plan of sloping the upper sheaves one\nover the other; and, in addition, filling the interstices with the\nmaterial of some untied sheaves.\n\nSo far all was well.  By this hurried contrivance Bathsheba's\nproperty in wheat was safe for at any rate a week or two, provided\nalways that there was not much wind.\n\nNext came the barley.  This it was only possible to protect by\nsystematic thatching.  Time went on, and the moon vanished not to\nreappear.  It was the farewell of the ambassador previous to war.\nThe night had a haggard look, like a sick thing; and there came\nfinally an utter expiration of air from the whole heaven in the form\nof a slow breeze, which might have been likened to a death.  And now\nnothing was heard in the yard but the dull thuds of the beetle which\ndrove in the spars, and the rustle of thatch in the intervals.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\n\nTHE STORM--THE TWO TOGETHER\n\n\nA light flapped over the scene, as if reflected from phosphorescent\nwings crossing the sky, and a rumble filled the air.  It was the\nfirst move of the approaching storm.\n\nThe second peal was noisy, with comparatively little visible\nlightning.  Gabriel saw a candle shining in Bathsheba's bedroom,\nand soon a shadow swept to and fro upon the blind.\n\nThen there came a third flash.  Manoeuvres of a most extraordinary\nkind were going on in the vast firmamental hollows overhead.  The\nlightning now was the colour of silver, and gleamed in the heavens\nlike a mailed army. Rumbles became rattles.  Gabriel from his\nelevated position could see over the landscape at least half-a-dozen\nmiles in front.  Every hedge, bush, and tree was distinct as in a\nline engraving.  In a paddock in the same direction was a herd of\nheifers, and the forms of these were visible at this moment in the\nact of galloping about in the wildest and maddest confusion, flinging\ntheir heels and tails high into the air, their heads to earth.\nA poplar in the immediate foreground was like an ink stroke on\nburnished tin.  Then the picture vanished, leaving the darkness so\nintense that Gabriel worked entirely by feeling with his hands.\n\nHe had stuck his ricking-rod, or poniard, as it was indifferently\ncalled--a long iron lance, polished by handling--into the stack,\nused to support the sheaves instead of the support called a groom\nused on houses.  A blue light appeared in the zenith, and in some\nindescribable manner flickered down near the top of the rod.  It\nwas the fourth of the larger flashes.  A moment later and there was\na smack--smart, clear, and short.  Gabriel felt his position to be\nanything but a safe one, and he resolved to descend.\n\nNot a drop of rain had fallen as yet.  He wiped his weary brow, and\nlooked again at the black forms of the unprotected stacks.  Was his\nlife so valuable to him after all?  What were his prospects that he\nshould be so chary of running risk, when important and urgent labour\ncould not be carried on without such risk?  He resolved to stick to\nthe stack.  However, he took a precaution.  Under the staddles was a\nlong tethering chain, used to prevent the escape of errant horses.\nThis he carried up the ladder, and sticking his rod through the clog\nat one end, allowed the other end of the chain to trail upon the\nground.  The spike attached to it he drove in.  Under the shadow of\nthis extemporized lightning-conductor he felt himself comparatively\nsafe.\n\nBefore Oak had laid his hands upon his tools again out leapt the\nfifth flash, with the spring of a serpent and the shout of a fiend.\nIt was green as an emerald, and the reverberation was stunning.  What\nwas this the light revealed to him?  In the open ground before him,\nas he looked over the ridge of the rick, was a dark and apparently\nfemale form.  Could it be that of the only venturesome woman in the\nparish--Bathsheba?  The form moved on a step: then he could see no\nmore.\n\n\"Is that you, ma'am?\" said Gabriel to the darkness.\n\n\"Who is there?\" said the voice of Bathsheba.\n\n\"Gabriel.  I am on the rick, thatching.\"\n\n\"Oh, Gabriel!--and are you?  I have come about them.  The weather\nawoke me, and I thought of the corn.  I am so distressed about\nit--can we save it anyhow?  I cannot find my husband.  Is he with\nyou?\"\n\n\"He is not here.\"\n\n\"Do you know where he is?\"\n\n\"Asleep in the barn.\"\n\n\"He promised that the stacks should be seen to, and now they are all\nneglected!  Can I do anything to help?  Liddy is afraid to come out.\nFancy finding you here at such an hour!  Surely I can do something?\"\n\n\"You can bring up some reed-sheaves to me, one by one, ma'am; if you\nare not afraid to come up the ladder in the dark,\" said Gabriel.\n\"Every moment is precious now, and that would save a good deal of\ntime.  It is not very dark when the lightning has been gone a bit.\"\n\n\"I'll do anything!\" she said, resolutely.  She instantly took a sheaf\nupon her shoulder, clambered up close to his heels, placed it behind\nthe rod, and descended for another.  At her third ascent the rick\nsuddenly brightened with the brazen glare of shining majolica--every\nknot in every straw was visible.  On the slope in front of him\nappeared two human shapes, black as jet.  The rick lost its\nsheen--the shapes vanished.  Gabriel turned his head.  It had been\nthe sixth flash which had come from the east behind him, and the two\ndark forms on the slope had been the shadows of himself and\nBathsheba.\n\nThen came the peal.  It hardly was credible that such a heavenly\nlight could be the parent of such a diabolical sound.\n\n\"How terrible!\" she exclaimed, and clutched him by the sleeve.\nGabriel turned, and steadied her on her aerial perch by holding\nher arm.  At the same moment, while he was still reversed in his\nattitude, there was more light, and he saw, as it were, a copy of the\ntall poplar tree on the hill drawn in black on the wall of the barn.\nIt was the shadow of that tree, thrown across by a secondary flash\nin the west.\n\nThe next flare came.  Bathsheba was on the ground now, shouldering\nanother sheaf, and she bore its dazzle without flinching--thunder\nand all--and again ascended with the load.  There was then a silence\neverywhere for four or five minutes, and the crunch of the spars, as\nGabriel hastily drove them in, could again be distinctly heard.  He\nthought the crisis of the storm had passed.  But there came a burst\nof light.\n\n\"Hold on!\" said Gabriel, taking the sheaf from her shoulder, and\ngrasping her arm again.\n\nHeaven opened then, indeed.  The flash was almost too novel for its\ninexpressibly dangerous nature to be at once realized, and they could\nonly comprehend the magnificence of its beauty.  It sprang from\neast, west, north, south, and was a perfect dance of death.  The\nforms of skeletons appeared in the air, shaped with blue fire for\nbones--dancing, leaping, striding, racing around, and mingling\naltogether in unparalleled confusion.  With these were intertwined\nundulating snakes of green, and behind these was a broad mass of\nlesser light.  Simultaneously came from every part of the tumbling\nsky what may be called a shout; since, though no shout ever came\nnear it, it was more of the nature of a shout than of anything else\nearthly.  In the meantime one of the grisly forms had alighted upon\nthe point of Gabriel's rod, to run invisibly down it, down the chain,\nand into the earth.  Gabriel was almost blinded, and he could feel\nBathsheba's warm arm tremble in his hand--a sensation novel and\nthrilling enough; but love, life, everything human, seemed small and\ntrifling in such close juxtaposition with an infuriated universe.\n\nOak had hardly time to gather up these impressions into a thought,\nand to see how strangely the red feather of her hat shone in this\nlight, when the tall tree on the hill before mentioned seemed on fire\nto a white heat, and a new one among these terrible voices mingled\nwith the last crash of those preceding.  It was a stupefying blast,\nharsh and pitiless, and it fell upon their ears in a dead, flat blow,\nwithout that reverberation which lends the tones of a drum to more\ndistant thunder.  By the lustre reflected from every part of the\nearth and from the wide domical scoop above it, he saw that the\ntree was sliced down the whole length of its tall, straight stem, a\nhuge riband of bark being apparently flung off.  The other portion\nremained erect, and revealed the bared surface as a strip of white\ndown the front.  The lightning had struck the tree.  A sulphurous\nsmell filled the air; then all was silent, and black as a cave in\nHinnom.\n\n\"We had a narrow escape!\" said Gabriel, hurriedly.  \"You had better\ngo down.\"\n\nBathsheba said nothing; but he could distinctly hear her rhythmical\npants, and the recurrent rustle of the sheaf beside her in response\nto her frightened pulsations.  She descended the ladder, and, on\nsecond thoughts, he followed her.  The darkness was now impenetrable\nby the sharpest vision.  They both stood still at the bottom, side by\nside.  Bathsheba appeared to think only of the weather--Oak thought\nonly of her just then.  At last he said--\n\n\"The storm seems to have passed now, at any rate.\"\n\n\"I think so too,\" said Bathsheba.  \"Though there are multitudes of\ngleams, look!\"\n\nThe sky was now filled with an incessant light, frequent repetition\nmelting into complete continuity, as an unbroken sound results from\nthe successive strokes on a gong.\n\n\"Nothing serious,\" said he.  \"I cannot understand no rain falling.\nBut Heaven be praised, it is all the better for us.  I am now going\nup again.\"\n\n\"Gabriel, you are kinder than I deserve!  I will stay and help you\nyet.  Oh, why are not some of the others here!\"\n\n\"They would have been here if they could,\" said Oak, in a hesitating\nway.\n\n\"O, I know it all--all,\" she said, adding slowly: \"They are all\nasleep in the barn, in a drunken sleep, and my husband among them.\nThat's it, is it not?  Don't think I am a timid woman and can't\nendure things.\"\n\n\"I am not certain,\" said Gabriel.  \"I will go and see.\"\n\nHe crossed to the barn, leaving her there alone.  He looked through\nthe chinks of the door.  All was in total darkness, as he had left\nit, and there still arose, as at the former time, the steady buzz of\nmany snores.\n\nHe felt a zephyr curling about his cheek, and turned.  It was\nBathsheba's breath--she had followed him, and was looking into the\nsame chink.\n\nHe endeavoured to put off the immediate and painful subject of\ntheir thoughts by remarking gently, \"If you'll come back again,\nmiss--ma'am, and hand up a few more; it would save much time.\"\n\nThen Oak went back again, ascended to the top, stepped off the ladder\nfor greater expedition, and went on thatching.  She followed, but\nwithout a sheaf.\n\n\"Gabriel,\" she said, in a strange and impressive voice.\n\nOak looked up at her.  She had not spoken since he left the barn.\nThe soft and continual shimmer of the dying lightning showed a marble\nface high against the black sky of the opposite quarter.  Bathsheba\nwas sitting almost on the apex of the stack, her feet gathered up\nbeneath her, and resting on the top round of the ladder.\n\n\"Yes, mistress,\" he said.\n\n\"I suppose you thought that when I galloped away to Bath that night\nit was on purpose to be married?\"\n\n\"I did at last--not at first,\" he answered, somewhat surprised at the\nabruptness with which this new subject was broached.\n\n\"And others thought so, too?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you blamed me for it?\"\n\n\"Well--a little.\"\n\n\"I thought so.  Now, I care a little for your good opinion, and\nI want to explain something--I have longed to do it ever since I\nreturned, and you looked so gravely at me.  For if I were to die--and\nI may die soon--it would be dreadful that you should always think\nmistakenly of me.  Now, listen.\"\n\nGabriel ceased his rustling.\n\n\"I went to Bath that night in the full intention of breaking off my\nengagement to Mr. Troy.  It was owing to circumstances which occurred\nafter I got there that--that we were married.  Now, do you see the\nmatter in a new light?\"\n\n\"I do--somewhat.\"\n\n\"I must, I suppose, say more, now that I have begun.  And perhaps\nit's no harm, for you are certainly under no delusion that I ever\nloved you, or that I can have any object in speaking, more than that\nobject I have mentioned.  Well, I was alone in a strange city, and\nthe horse was lame.  And at last I didn't know what to do.  I saw,\nwhen it was too late, that scandal might seize hold of me for meeting\nhim alone in that way.  But I was coming away, when he suddenly said\nhe had that day seen a woman more beautiful than I, and that his\nconstancy could not be counted on unless I at once became his....\nAnd I was grieved and troubled--\"  She cleared her voice, and waited\na moment, as if to gather breath.  \"And then, between jealousy\nand distraction, I married him!\" she whispered with desperate\nimpetuosity.\n\nGabriel made no reply.\n\n\"He was not to blame, for it was perfectly true about--about his\nseeing somebody else,\" she quickly added.  \"And now I don't wish for\na single remark from you upon the subject--indeed, I forbid it.  I\nonly wanted you to know that misunderstood bit of my history before\na time comes when you could never know it.--You want some more\nsheaves?\"\n\nShe went down the ladder, and the work proceeded.  Gabriel soon\nperceived a languor in the movements of his mistress up and down, and\nhe said to her, gently as a mother--\n\n\"I think you had better go indoors now, you are tired.  I can finish\nthe rest alone.  If the wind does not change the rain is likely to\nkeep off.\"\n\n\"If I am useless I will go,\" said Bathsheba, in a flagging cadence.\n\"But O, if your life should be lost!\"\n\n\"You are not useless; but I would rather not tire you longer.  You\nhave done well.\"\n\n\"And you better!\" she said, gratefully.  \"Thank you for your\ndevotion, a thousand times, Gabriel!  Goodnight--I know you are doing\nyour very best for me.\"\n\nShe diminished in the gloom, and vanished, and he heard the latch\nof the gate fall as she passed through.  He worked in a reverie\nnow, musing upon her story, and upon the contradictoriness of that\nfeminine heart which had caused her to speak more warmly to him\nto-night than she ever had done whilst unmarried and free to speak\nas warmly as she chose.\n\nHe was disturbed in his meditation by a grating noise from the\ncoach-house.  It was the vane on the roof turning round, and this\nchange in the wind was the signal for a disastrous rain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\n\nRAIN--ONE SOLITARY MEETS ANOTHER\n\n\nIt was now five o'clock, and the dawn was promising to break in hues\nof drab and ash.\n\nThe air changed its temperature and stirred itself more vigorously.\nCool breezes coursed in transparent eddies round Oak's face.  The\nwind shifted yet a point or two and blew stronger.  In ten minutes\nevery wind of heaven seemed to be roaming at large.  Some of the\nthatching on the wheat-stacks was now whirled fantastically aloft,\nand had to be replaced and weighted with some rails that lay near at\nhand.  This done, Oak slaved away again at the barley.  A huge drop\nof rain smote his face, the wind snarled round every corner, the\ntrees rocked to the bases of their trunks, and the twigs clashed in\nstrife.  Driving in spars at any point and on any system, inch by\ninch he covered more and more safely from ruin this distracting\nimpersonation of seven hundred pounds.  The rain came on in earnest,\nand Oak soon felt the water to be tracking cold and clammy routes\ndown his back.  Ultimately he was reduced well-nigh to a homogeneous\nsop, and the dyes of his clothes trickled down and stood in a pool\nat the foot of the ladder.  The rain stretched obliquely through the\ndull atmosphere in liquid spines, unbroken in continuity between\ntheir beginnings in the clouds and their points in him.\n\nOak suddenly remembered that eight months before this time he had\nbeen fighting against fire in the same spot as desperately as he\nwas fighting against water now--and for a futile love of the same\nwoman.  As for her--But Oak was generous and true, and dismissed\nhis reflections.\n\nIt was about seven o'clock in the dark leaden morning when Gabriel\ncame down from the last stack, and thankfully exclaimed, \"It is\ndone!\"  He was drenched, weary, and sad, and yet not so sad as\ndrenched and weary, for he was cheered by a sense of success in a\ngood cause.\n\nFaint sounds came from the barn, and he looked that way.  Figures\nstepped singly and in pairs through the doors--all walking awkwardly,\nand abashed, save the foremost, who wore a red jacket, and advanced\nwith his hands in his pockets, whistling.  The others shambled after\nwith a conscience-stricken air: the whole procession was not unlike\nFlaxman's group of the suitors tottering on towards the infernal\nregions under the conduct of Mercury.  The gnarled shapes passed\ninto the village, Troy, their leader, entering the farmhouse.  Not a\nsingle one of them had turned his face to the ricks, or apparently\nbestowed one thought upon their condition.\n\nSoon Oak too went homeward, by a different route from theirs.  In\nfront of him against the wet glazed surface of the lane he saw a\nperson walking yet more slowly than himself under an umbrella.  The\nman turned and plainly started; he was Boldwood.\n\n\"How are you this morning, sir?\" said Oak.\n\n\"Yes, it is a wet day.--Oh, I am well, very well, I thank you; quite\nwell.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear it, sir.\"\n\nBoldwood seemed to awake to the present by degrees.  \"You look tired\nand ill, Oak,\" he said then, desultorily regarding his companion.\n\n\"I am tired.  You look strangely altered, sir.\"\n\n\"I?  Not a bit of it: I am well enough.  What put that into your\nhead?\"\n\n\"I thought you didn't look quite so topping as you used to, that was\nall.\"\n\n\"Indeed, then you are mistaken,\" said Boldwood, shortly.  \"Nothing\nhurts me.  My constitution is an iron one.\"\n\n\"I've been working hard to get our ricks covered, and was barely in\ntime.  Never had such a struggle in my life....  Yours of course are\nsafe, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" Boldwood added, after an interval of silence: \"What did you\nask, Oak?\"\n\n\"Your ricks are all covered before this time?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"At any rate, the large ones upon the stone staddles?\"\n\n\"They are not.\"\n\n\"Them under the hedge?\"\n\n\"No.  I forgot to tell the thatcher to set about it.\"\n\n\"Nor the little one by the stile?\"\n\n\"Nor the little one by the stile.  I overlooked the ricks this year.\"\n\n\"Then not a tenth of your corn will come to measure, sir.\"\n\n\"Possibly not.\"\n\n\"Overlooked them,\" repeated Gabriel slowly to himself.  It is\ndifficult to describe the intensely dramatic effect that announcement\nhad upon Oak at such a moment.  All the night he had been feeling\nthat the neglect he was labouring to repair was abnormal and\nisolated--the only instance of the kind within the circuit of the\ncounty.  Yet at this very time, within the same parish, a greater\nwaste had been going on, uncomplained of and disregarded.  A few\nmonths earlier Boldwood's forgetting his husbandry would have been as\npreposterous an idea as a sailor forgetting he was in a ship.  Oak\nwas just thinking that whatever he himself might have suffered from\nBathsheba's marriage, here was a man who had suffered more, when\nBoldwood spoke in a changed voice--that of one who yearned to make\na confidence and relieve his heart by an outpouring.\n\n\"Oak, you know as well as I that things have gone wrong with me\nlately.  I may as well own it.  I was going to get a little settled\nin life; but in some way my plan has come to nothing.\"\n\n\"I thought my mistress would have married you,\" said Gabriel, not\nknowing enough of the full depths of Boldwood's love to keep silence\non the farmer's account, and determined not to evade discipline by\ndoing so on his own.  \"However, it is so sometimes, and nothing\nhappens that we expect,\" he added, with the repose of a man whom\nmisfortune had inured rather than subdued.\n\n\"I daresay I am a joke about the parish,\" said Boldwood, as if\nthe subject came irresistibly to his tongue, and with a miserable\nlightness meant to express his indifference.\n\n\"Oh no--I don't think that.\"\n\n\"--But the real truth of the matter is that there was not, as some\nfancy, any jilting on--her part.  No engagement ever existed between\nme and Miss Everdene.  People say so, but it is untrue: she never\npromised me!\"  Boldwood stood still now and turned his wild face to\nOak.  \"Oh, Gabriel,\" he continued, \"I am weak and foolish, and I\ndon't know what, and I can't fend off my miserable grief! ...  I had\nsome faint belief in the mercy of God till I lost that woman.  Yes,\nHe prepared a gourd to shade me, and like the prophet I thanked Him\nand was glad.  But the next day He prepared a worm to smite the gourd\nand wither it; and I feel it is better to die than to live!\"\n\nA silence followed.  Boldwood aroused himself from the momentary\nmood of confidence into which he had drifted, and walked on again,\nresuming his usual reserve.\n\n\"No, Gabriel,\" he resumed, with a carelessness which was like\nthe smile on the countenance of a skull: \"it was made more of by\nother people than ever it was by us.  I do feel a little regret\noccasionally, but no woman ever had power over me for any length of\ntime.  Well, good morning; I can trust you not to mention to others\nwhat has passed between us two here.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\n\nCOMING HOME--A CRY\n\n\nOn the turnpike road, between Casterbridge and Weatherbury, and about\nthree miles from the former place, is Yalbury Hill, one of those\nsteep long ascents which pervade the highways of this undulating\npart of South Wessex.  In returning from market it is usual for the\nfarmers and other gig-gentry to alight at the bottom and walk up.\n\nOne Saturday evening in the month of October Bathsheba's vehicle was\nduly creeping up this incline.  She was sitting listlessly in the\nsecond seat of the gig, whilst walking beside her in a farmer's\nmarketing suit of unusually fashionable cut was an erect, well-made\nyoung man.  Though on foot, he held the reins and whip, and\noccasionally aimed light cuts at the horse's ear with the end of the\nlash, as a recreation.  This man was her husband, formerly Sergeant\nTroy, who, having bought his discharge with Bathsheba's money, was\ngradually transforming himself into a farmer of a spirited and very\nmodern school.  People of unalterable ideas still insisted upon\ncalling him \"Sergeant\" when they met him, which was in some degree\nowing to his having still retained the well-shaped moustache of his\nmilitary days, and the soldierly bearing inseparable from his form\nand training.\n\n\"Yes, if it hadn't been for that wretched rain I should have cleared\ntwo hundred as easy as looking, my love,\" he was saying.  \"Don't you\nsee, it altered all the chances?  To speak like a book I once read,\nwet weather is the narrative, and fine days are the episodes, of our\ncountry's history; now, isn't that true?\"\n\n\"But the time of year is come for changeable weather.\"\n\n\"Well, yes.  The fact is, these autumn races are the ruin of\neverybody.  Never did I see such a day as 'twas!  'Tis a wild open\nplace, just out of Budmouth, and a drab sea rolled in towards us like\nliquid misery.  Wind and rain--good Lord!  Dark?  Why, 'twas as black\nas my hat before the last race was run.  'Twas five o'clock, and\nyou couldn't see the horses till they were almost in, leave alone\ncolours.  The ground was as heavy as lead, and all judgment from a\nfellow's experience went for nothing.  Horses, riders, people, were\nall blown about like ships at sea.  Three booths were blown over,\nand the wretched folk inside crawled out upon their hands and knees;\nand in the next field were as many as a dozen hats at one time.  Ay,\nPimpernel regularly stuck fast, when about sixty yards off, and when\nI saw Policy stepping on, it did knock my heart against the lining\nof my ribs, I assure you, my love!\"\n\n\"And you mean, Frank,\" said Bathsheba, sadly--her voice was painfully\nlowered from the fulness and vivacity of the previous summer--\"that\nyou have lost more than a hundred pounds in a month by this dreadful\nhorse-racing?  O, Frank, it is cruel; it is foolish of you to take\naway my money so.  We shall have to leave the farm; that will be the\nend of it!\"\n\n\"Humbug about cruel.  Now, there 'tis again--turn on the waterworks;\nthat's just like you.\"\n\n\"But you'll promise me not to go to Budmouth second meeting, won't\nyou?\" she implored.  Bathsheba was at the full depth for tears, but\nshe maintained a dry eye.\n\n\"I don't see why I should; in fact, if it turns out to be a fine day,\nI was thinking of taking you.\"\n\n\"Never, never!  I'll go a hundred miles the other way first. I hate\nthe sound of the very word!\"\n\n\"But the question of going to see the race or staying at home has\nvery little to do with the matter.  Bets are all booked safely enough\nbefore the race begins, you may depend.  Whether it is a bad race for\nme or a good one, will have very little to do with our going there\nnext Monday.\"\n\n\"But you don't mean to say that you have risked anything on this one\ntoo!\" she exclaimed, with an agonized look.\n\n\"There now, don't you be a little fool.  Wait till you are told.\nWhy, Bathsheba, you have lost all the pluck and sauciness you\nformerly had, and upon my life if I had known what a chicken-hearted\ncreature you were under all your boldness, I'd never have--I know\nwhat.\"\n\nA flash of indignation might have been seen in Bathsheba's dark eyes\nas she looked resolutely ahead after this reply.  They moved on\nwithout further speech, some early-withered leaves from the trees\nwhich hooded the road at this spot occasionally spinning downward\nacross their path to the earth.\n\nA woman appeared on the brow of the hill.  The ridge was in a\ncutting, so that she was very near the husband and wife before she\nbecame visible.  Troy had turned towards the gig to remount, and\nwhilst putting his foot on the step the woman passed behind him.\n\nThough the overshadowing trees and the approach of eventide enveloped\nthem in gloom, Bathsheba could see plainly enough to discern the\nextreme poverty of the woman's garb, and the sadness of her face.\n\n\"Please, sir, do you know at what time Casterbridge Union-house\ncloses at night?\"\n\nThe woman said these words to Troy over his shoulder.\n\nTroy started visibly at the sound of the voice; yet he seemed to\nrecover presence of mind sufficient to prevent himself from giving\nway to his impulse to suddenly turn and face her.  He said, slowly--\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nThe woman, on hearing him speak, quickly looked up, examined the side\nof his face, and recognized the soldier under the yeoman's garb.  Her\nface was drawn into an expression which had gladness and agony both\namong its elements.  She uttered an hysterical cry, and fell down.\n\n\"Oh, poor thing!\" exclaimed Bathsheba, instantly preparing to alight.\n\n\"Stay where you are, and attend to the horse!\" said Troy,\nperemptorily throwing her the reins and the whip.  \"Walk the horse\nto the top: I'll see to the woman.\"\n\n\"But I--\"\n\n\"Do you hear?  Clk--Poppet!\"\n\nThe horse, gig, and Bathsheba moved on.\n\n\"How on earth did you come here?  I thought you were miles away, or\ndead!  Why didn't you write to me?\" said Troy to the woman, in a\nstrangely gentle, yet hurried voice, as he lifted her up.\n\n\"I feared to.\"\n\n\"Have you any money?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"Good Heaven--I wish I had more to give you!  Here's--wretched--the\nmerest trifle.  It is every farthing I have left.  I have none but\nwhat my wife gives me, you know, and I can't ask her now.\"\n\nThe woman made no answer.\n\n\"I have only another moment,\" continued Troy; \"and now listen.  Where\nare you going to-night?  Casterbridge Union?\"\n\n\"Yes; I thought to go there.\"\n\n\"You shan't go there; yet, wait.  Yes, perhaps for to-night; I can\ndo nothing better--worse luck!  Sleep there to-night, and stay there\nto-morrow.  Monday is the first free day I have; and on Monday\nmorning, at ten exactly, meet me on Grey's Bridge just out of the\ntown.  I'll bring all the money I can muster.  You shan't want--I'll\nsee that, Fanny; then I'll get you a lodging somewhere.  Good-bye\ntill then.  I am a brute--but good-bye!\"\n\nAfter advancing the distance which completed the ascent of the\nhill, Bathsheba turned her head.  The woman was upon her feet, and\nBathsheba saw her withdrawing from Troy, and going feebly down the\nhill by the third milestone from Casterbridge.  Troy then came on\ntowards his wife, stepped into the gig, took the reins from her hand,\nand without making any observation whipped the horse into a trot.  He\nwas rather agitated.\n\n\"Do you know who that woman was?\" said Bathsheba, looking searchingly\ninto his face.\n\n\"I do,\" he said, looking boldly back into hers.\n\n\"I thought you did,\" said she, with angry hauteur, and still\nregarding him.  \"Who is she?\"\n\nHe suddenly seemed to think that frankness would benefit neither of\nthe women.\n\n\"Nothing to either of us,\" he said.  \"I know her by sight.\"\n\n\"What is her name?\"\n\n\"How should I know her name?\"\n\n\"I think you do.\"\n\n\"Think if you will, and be--\" The sentence was completed by a smart\ncut of the whip round Poppet's flank, which caused the animal to\nstart forward at a wild pace.  No more was said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\n\nON CASTERBRIDGE HIGHWAY\n\n\nFor a considerable time the woman walked on.  Her steps became\nfeebler, and she strained her eyes to look afar upon the naked road,\nnow indistinct amid the penumbr\u00c3\u00a6 of night.  At length her onward walk\ndwindled to the merest totter, and she opened a gate within which was\na haystack.  Underneath this she sat down and presently slept.\n\nWhen the woman awoke it was to find herself in the depths of a\nmoonless and starless night.  A heavy unbroken crust of cloud\nstretched across the sky, shutting out every speck of heaven; and a\ndistant halo which hung over the town of Casterbridge was visible\nagainst the black concave, the luminosity appearing the brighter by\nits great contrast with the circumscribing darkness.  Towards this\nweak, soft glow the woman turned her eyes.\n\n\"If I could only get there!\" she said.  \"Meet him the day after\nto-morrow: God help me!  Perhaps I shall be in my grave before then.\"\n\nA manor-house clock from the far depths of shadow struck the hour,\none, in a small, attenuated tone.  After midnight the voice of a\nclock seems to lose in breadth as much as in length, and to diminish\nits sonorousness to a thin falsetto.\n\nAfterwards a light--two lights--arose from the remote shade, and grew\nlarger.  A carriage rolled along the road, and passed the gate.  It\nprobably contained some late diners-out.  The beams from one lamp\nshone for a moment upon the crouching woman, and threw her face into\nvivid relief.  The face was young in the groundwork, old in the\nfinish; the general contours were flexuous and childlike, but the\nfiner lineaments had begun to be sharp and thin.\n\nThe pedestrian stood up, apparently with revived determination, and\nlooked around.  The road appeared to be familiar to her, and she\ncarefully scanned the fence as she slowly walked along.  Presently\nthere became visible a dim white shape; it was another milestone.\nShe drew her fingers across its face to feel the marks.\n\n\"Two more!\" she said.\n\nShe leant against the stone as a means of rest for a short interval,\nthen bestirred herself, and again pursued her way.  For a slight\ndistance she bore up bravely, afterwards flagging as before.  This\nwas beside a lone copsewood, wherein heaps of white chips strewn upon\nthe leafy ground showed that woodmen had been faggoting and making\nhurdles during the day.  Now there was not a rustle, not a breeze,\nnot the faintest clash of twigs to keep her company.  The woman\nlooked over the gate, opened it, and went in.  Close to the entrance\nstood a row of faggots, bound and un-bound, together with stakes of\nall sizes.\n\nFor a few seconds the wayfarer stood with that tense stillness which\nsignifies itself to be not the end, but merely the suspension, of\na previous motion.  Her attitude was that of a person who listens,\neither to the external world of sound, or to the imagined discourse\nof thought.  A close criticism might have detected signs proving that\nshe was intent on the latter alternative.  Moreover, as was shown by\nwhat followed, she was oddly exercising the faculty of invention upon\nthe speciality of the clever Jacquet Droz, the designer of automatic\nsubstitutes for human limbs.\n\nBy the aid of the Casterbridge aurora, and by feeling with her hands,\nthe woman selected two sticks from the heaps.  These sticks were\nnearly straight to the height of three or four feet, where each\nbranched into a fork like the letter Y.  She sat down, snapped off\nthe small upper twigs, and carried the remainder with her into the\nroad.  She placed one of these forks under each arm as a crutch,\ntested them, timidly threw her whole weight upon them--so little that\nit was--and swung herself forward.  The girl had made for herself a\nmaterial aid.\n\nThe crutches answered well.  The pat of her feet, and the tap of\nher sticks upon the highway, were all the sounds that came from\nthe traveller now.  She had passed the last milestone by a good\nlong distance, and began to look wistfully towards the bank as if\ncalculating upon another milestone soon.  The crutches, though so\nvery useful, had their limits of power.  Mechanism only transfers\nlabour, being powerless to supersede it, and the original amount of\nexertion was not cleared away; it was thrown into the body and arms.\nShe was exhausted, and each swing forward became fainter.  At last\nshe swayed sideways, and fell.\n\nHere she lay, a shapeless heap, for ten minutes and more.  The\nmorning wind began to boom dully over the flats, and to move afresh\ndead leaves which had lain still since yesterday.  The woman\ndesperately turned round upon her knees, and next rose to her feet.\nSteadying herself by the help of one crutch, she essayed a step, then\nanother, then a third, using the crutches now as walking-sticks only.\nThus she progressed till descending Mellstock Hill another milestone\nappeared, and soon the beginning of an iron-railed fence came into\nview.  She staggered across to the first post, clung to it, and\nlooked around.\n\nThe Casterbridge lights were now individually visible. It was getting\ntowards morning, and vehicles might be hoped for, if not expected\nsoon.  She listened.  There was not a sound of life save that acme\nand sublimation of all dismal sounds, the bark of a fox, its three\nhollow notes being rendered at intervals of a minute with the\nprecision of a funeral bell.\n\n\"Less than a mile!\" the woman murmured.  \"No; more,\" she added, after\na pause.  \"The mile is to the county hall, and my resting-place is on\nthe other side Casterbridge.  A little over a mile, and there I am!\"\nAfter an interval she again spoke.  \"Five or six steps to a yard--six\nperhaps.  I have to go seventeen hundred yards.  A hundred times six,\nsix hundred.  Seventeen times that.  O pity me, Lord!\"\n\nHolding to the rails, she advanced, thrusting one hand forward upon\nthe rail, then the other, then leaning over it whilst she dragged her\nfeet on beneath.\n\nThis woman was not given to soliloquy; but extremity of feeling\nlessens the individuality of the weak, as it increases that of the\nstrong.  She said again in the same tone, \"I'll believe that the end\nlies five posts forward, and no further, and so get strength to pass\nthem.\"\n\nThis was a practical application of the principle that a half-feigned\nand fictitious faith is better than no faith at all.\n\nShe passed five posts and held on to the fifth.\n\n\"I'll pass five more by believing my longed-for spot is at the next\nfifth.  I can do it.\"\n\nShe passed five more.\n\n\"It lies only five further.\"\n\nShe passed five more.\n\n\"But it is five further.\"\n\nShe passed them.\n\n\"That stone bridge is the end of my journey,\" she said, when the\nbridge over the Froom was in view.\n\nShe crawled to the bridge.  During the effort each breath of the\nwoman went into the air as if never to return again.\n\n\"Now for the truth of the matter,\" she said, sitting down.  \"The\ntruth is, that I have less than half a mile.\"  Self-beguilement with\nwhat she had known all the time to be false had given her strength to\ncome over half a mile that she would have been powerless to face in\nthe lump.  The artifice showed that the woman, by some mysterious\nintuition, had grasped the paradoxical truth that blindness may\noperate more vigorously than prescience, and the short-sighted effect\nmore than the far-seeing; that limitation, and not comprehensiveness,\nis needed for striking a blow.\n\nThe half-mile stood now before the sick and weary woman like a stolid\nJuggernaut.  It was an impassive King of her world.  The road here\nran across Durnover Moor, open to the road on either side.  She\nsurveyed the wide space, the lights, herself, sighed, and lay down\nagainst a guard-stone of the bridge.\n\nNever was ingenuity exercised so sorely as the traveller here\nexercised hers.  Every conceivable aid, method, stratagem, mechanism,\nby which these last desperate eight hundred yards could be overpassed\nby a human being unperceived, was revolved in her busy brain,\nand dismissed as impracticable.  She thought of sticks, wheels,\ncrawling--she even thought of rolling.  But the exertion demanded\nby either of these latter two was greater than to walk erect.  The\nfaculty of contrivance was worn out.  Hopelessness had come at last.\n\n\"No further!\" she whispered, and closed her eyes.\n\nFrom the stripe of shadow on the opposite side of the bridge a\nportion of shade seemed to detach itself and move into isolation\nupon the pale white of the road.  It glided noiselessly towards the\nrecumbent woman.\n\nShe became conscious of something touching her hand; it was softness\nand it was warmth.  She opened her eyes, and the substance touched\nher face.  A dog was licking her cheek.\n\nHe was a huge, heavy, and quiet creature, standing darkly against the\nlow horizon, and at least two feet higher than the present position\nof her eyes.  Whether Newfoundland, mastiff, bloodhound, or what\nnot, it was impossible to say.  He seemed to be of too strange and\nmysterious a nature to belong to any variety among those of popular\nnomenclature.  Being thus assignable to no breed, he was the ideal\nembodiment of canine greatness--a generalization from what was common\nto all.  Night, in its sad, solemn, and benevolent aspect, apart from\nits stealthy and cruel side, was personified in this form.  Darkness\nendows the small and ordinary ones among mankind with poetical power,\nand even the suffering woman threw her idea into figure.\n\nIn her reclining position she looked up to him just as in earlier\ntimes she had, when standing, looked up to a man.  The animal, who\nwas as homeless as she, respectfully withdrew a step or two when the\nwoman moved, and, seeing that she did not repulse him, he licked her\nhand again.\n\nA thought moved within her like lightning.  \"Perhaps I can make use\nof him--I might do it then!\"\n\nShe pointed in the direction of Casterbridge, and the dog seemed to\nmisunderstand: he trotted on.  Then, finding she could not follow, he\ncame back and whined.\n\nThe ultimate and saddest singularity of woman's effort and invention\nwas reached when, with a quickened breathing, she rose to a stooping\nposture, and, resting her two little arms upon the shoulders of the\ndog, leant firmly thereon, and murmured stimulating words.  Whilst\nshe sorrowed in her heart she cheered with her voice, and what was\nstranger than that the strong should need encouragement from the weak\nwas that cheerfulness should be so well stimulated by such utter\ndejection.  Her friend moved forward slowly, and she with small\nmincing steps moved forward beside him, half her weight being thrown\nupon the animal.  Sometimes she sank as she had sunk from walking\nerect, from the crutches, from the rails.  The dog, who now\nthoroughly understood her desire and her incapacity, was frantic in\nhis distress on these occasions; he would tug at her dress and run\nforward.  She always called him back, and it was now to be observed\nthat the woman listened for human sounds only to avoid them.  It was\nevident that she had an object in keeping her presence on the road\nand her forlorn state unknown.\n\nTheir progress was necessarily very slow.  They reached the bottom\nof the town, and the Casterbridge lamps lay before them like fallen\nPleiads as they turned to the left into the dense shade of a deserted\navenue of chestnuts, and so skirted the borough.  Thus the town was\npassed, and the goal was reached.\n\nOn this much-desired spot outside the town rose a picturesque\nbuilding.  Originally it had been a mere case to hold people.  The\nshell had been so thin, so devoid of excrescence, and so closely\ndrawn over the accommodation granted, that the grim character of what\nwas beneath showed through it, as the shape of a body is visible\nunder a winding-sheet.\n\nThen Nature, as if offended, lent a hand.  Masses of ivy grew up,\ncompletely covering the walls, till the place looked like an abbey;\nand it was discovered that the view from the front, over the\nCasterbridge chimneys, was one of the most magnificent in the\ncounty. A neighbouring earl once said that he would give up a year's\nrental to have at his own door the view enjoyed by the inmates from\ntheirs--and very probably the inmates would have given up the view\nfor his year's rental.\n\nThis stone edifice consisted of a central mass and two wings, whereon\nstood as sentinels a few slim chimneys, now gurgling sorrowfully to\nthe slow wind.  In the wall was a gate, and by the gate a bellpull\nformed of a hanging wire.  The woman raised herself as high as\npossible upon her knees, and could just reach the handle.  She moved\nit and fell forwards in a bowed attitude, her face upon her bosom.\n\nIt was getting on towards six o'clock, and sounds of movement were\nto be heard inside the building which was the haven of rest to this\nwearied soul.  A little door by the large one was opened, and a man\nappeared inside.  He discerned the panting heap of clothes, went back\nfor a light, and came again.  He entered a second time, and returned\nwith two women.\n\nThese lifted the prostrate figure and assisted her in through the\ndoorway.  The man then closed the door.\n\n\"How did she get here?\" said one of the women.\n\n\"The Lord knows,\" said the other.\n\n\"There is a dog outside,\" murmured the overcome traveller.  \"Where is\nhe gone?  He helped me.\"\n\n\"I stoned him away,\" said the man.\n\nThe little procession then moved forward--the man in front bearing\nthe light, the two bony women next, supporting between them the small\nand supple one.  Thus they entered the house and disappeared.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\n\nSUSPICION--FANNY IS SENT FOR\n\n\nBathsheba said very little to her husband all that evening of their\nreturn from market, and he was not disposed to say much to her.  He\nexhibited the unpleasant combination of a restless condition with a\nsilent tongue.  The next day, which was Sunday, passed nearly in the\nsame manner as regarded their taciturnity, Bathsheba going to church\nboth morning and afternoon.  This was the day before the Budmouth\nraces.  In the evening Troy said, suddenly--\n\n\"Bathsheba, could you let me have twenty pounds?\"\n\nHer countenance instantly sank. \"Twenty pounds?\" she said.\n\n\"The fact is, I want it badly.\"  The anxiety upon Troy's face was\nunusual and very marked.  It was a culmination of the mood he had\nbeen in all the day.\n\n\"Ah! for those races to-morrow.\"\n\nTroy for the moment made no reply.  Her mistake had its advantages\nto a man who shrank from having his mind inspected as he did now.\n\"Well, suppose I do want it for races?\" he said, at last.\n\n\"Oh, Frank!\" Bathsheba replied, and there was such a volume of\nentreaty in the words.  \"Only such a few weeks ago you said that I\nwas far sweeter than all your other pleasures put together, and that\nyou would give them all up for me; and now, won't you give up this\none, which is more a worry than a pleasure?  Do, Frank.  Come, let\nme fascinate you by all I can do--by pretty words and pretty looks,\nand everything I can think of--to stay at home.  Say yes to your\nwife--say yes!\"\n\nThe tenderest and softest phases of Bathsheba's nature were prominent\nnow--advanced impulsively for his acceptance, without any of the\ndisguises and defences which the wariness of her character when she\nwas cool too frequently threw over them.  Few men could have resisted\nthe arch yet dignified entreaty of the beautiful face, thrown a\nlittle back and sideways in the well known attitude that expresses\nmore than the words it accompanies, and which seems to have been\ndesigned for these special occasions.  Had the woman not been his\nwife, Troy would have succumbed instantly; as it was, he thought he\nwould not deceive her longer.\n\n\"The money is not wanted for racing debts at all,\" he said.\n\n\"What is it for?\" she asked.  \"You worry me a great deal by these\nmysterious responsibilities, Frank.\"\n\nTroy hesitated.  He did not now love her enough to allow himself\nto be carried too far by her ways.  Yet it was necessary to be\ncivil.  \"You wrong me by such a suspicious manner,\" he said.  \"Such\nstrait-waistcoating as you treat me to is not becoming in you at so\nearly a date.\"\n\n\"I think that I have a right to grumble a little if I pay,\" she said,\nwith features between a smile and a pout.\n\n\"Exactly; and, the former being done, suppose we proceed to the\nlatter.  Bathsheba, fun is all very well, but don't go too far, or\nyou may have cause to regret something.\"\n\nShe reddened.  \"I do that already,\" she said, quickly.\n\n\"What do you regret?\"\n\n\"That my romance has come to an end.\"\n\n\"All romances end at marriage.\"\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't talk like that.  You grieve me to my soul by\nbeing smart at my expense.\"\n\n\"You are dull enough at mine.  I believe you hate me.\"\n\n\"Not you--only your faults.  I do hate them.\"\n\n\"'Twould be much more becoming if you set yourself to cure them.\nCome, let's strike a balance with the twenty pounds, and be friends.\"\n\nShe gave a sigh of resignation.  \"I have about that sum here for\nhousehold expenses.  If you must have it, take it.\"\n\n\"Very good.  Thank you.  I expect I shall have gone away before you\nare in to breakfast to-morrow.\"\n\n\"And must you go?  Ah! there was a time, Frank, when it would have\ntaken a good many promises to other people to drag you away from me.\nYou used to call me darling, then.  But it doesn't matter to you how\nmy days are passed now.\"\n\n\"I must go, in spite of sentiment.\"  Troy, as he spoke, looked at his\nwatch, and, apparently actuated by _non lucendo_ principles, opened\nthe case at the back, revealing, snugly stowed within it, a small\ncoil of hair.\n\nBathsheba's eyes had been accidentally lifted at that moment, and she\nsaw the action and saw the hair.  She flushed in pain and surprise,\nand some words escaped her before she had thought whether or not it\nwas wise to utter them.  \"A woman's curl of hair!\" she said.  \"Oh,\nFrank, whose is that?\"\n\nTroy had instantly closed his watch.  He carelessly replied, as one\nwho cloaked some feelings that the sight had stirred.  \"Why, yours,\nof course.  Whose should it be?  I had quite forgotten that I had\nit.\"\n\n\"What a dreadful fib, Frank!\"\n\n\"I tell you I had forgotten it!\" he said, loudly.\n\n\"I don't mean that--it was yellow hair.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"That's insulting me.  I know it was yellow.  Now whose was it?  I\nwant to know.\"\n\n\"Very well--I'll tell you, so make no more ado.  It is the hair of a\nyoung woman I was going to marry before I knew you.\"\n\n\"You ought to tell me her name, then.\"\n\n\"I cannot do that.\"\n\n\"Is she married yet?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Is she alive?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Is she pretty?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It is wonderful how she can be, poor thing, under such an awful\naffliction!\"\n\n\"Affliction--what affliction?\" he inquired, quickly.\n\n\"Having hair of that dreadful colour.\"\n\n\"Oh--ho--I like that!\" said Troy, recovering himself.  \"Why, her hair\nhas been admired by everybody who has seen her since she has worn it\nloose, which has not been long.  It is beautiful hair.  People used\nto turn their heads to look at it, poor girl!\"\n\n\"Pooh! that's nothing--that's nothing!\" she exclaimed, in incipient\naccents of pique.  \"If I cared for your love as much as I used to I\ncould say people had turned to look at mine.\"\n\n\"Bathsheba, don't be so fitful and jealous.  You knew what married\nlife would be like, and shouldn't have entered it if you feared these\ncontingencies.\"\n\nTroy had by this time driven her to bitterness: her heart was big in\nher throat, and the ducts to her eyes were painfully full.  Ashamed\nas she was to show emotion, at last she burst out:--\n\n\"This is all I get for loving you so well!  Ah! when I married you\nyour life was dearer to me than my own.  I would have died for\nyou--how truly I can say that I would have died for you!  And now\nyou sneer at my foolishness in marrying you.  O! is it kind to me to\nthrow my mistake in my face?  Whatever opinion you may have of my\nwisdom, you should not tell me of it so mercilessly, now that I am\nin your power.\"\n\n\"I can't help how things fall out,\" said Troy; \"upon my heart, women\nwill be the death of me!\"\n\n\"Well you shouldn't keep people's hair.  You'll burn it, won't you,\nFrank?\"\n\nFrank went on as if he had not heard her.  \"There are considerations\neven before my consideration for you; reparations to be made--ties\nyou know nothing of.  If you repent of marrying, so do I.\"\n\nTrembling now, she put her hand upon his arm, saying, in mingled\ntones of wretchedness and coaxing, \"I only repent it if you don't\nlove me better than any woman in the world!  I don't otherwise,\nFrank.  You don't repent because you already love somebody better\nthan you love me, do you?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  Why do you say that?\"\n\n\"You won't burn that curl.  You like the woman who owns that pretty\nhair--yes; it is pretty--more beautiful than my miserable black mane!\nWell, it is no use; I can't help being ugly.  You must like her best,\nif you will!\"\n\n\"Until to-day, when I took it from a drawer, I have never looked upon\nthat bit of hair for several months--that I am ready to swear.\"\n\n\"But just now you said 'ties'; and then--that woman we met?\"\n\n\"'Twas the meeting with her that reminded me of the hair.\"\n\n\"Is it hers, then?\"\n\n\"Yes.  There, now that you have wormed it out of me, I hope you are\ncontent.\"\n\n\"And what are the ties?\"\n\n\"Oh! that meant nothing--a mere jest.\"\n\n\"A mere jest!\" she said, in mournful astonishment.  \"Can you jest\nwhen I am so wretchedly in earnest?  Tell me the truth, Frank.  I\nam not a fool, you know, although I am a woman, and have my woman's\nmoments.  Come! treat me fairly,\" she said, looking honestly and\nfearlessly into his face.  \"I don't want much; bare justice--that's\nall!  Ah! once I felt I could be content with nothing less than the\nhighest homage from the husband I should choose.  Now, anything\nshort of cruelty will content me.  Yes! the independent and spirited\nBathsheba is come to this!\"\n\n\"For Heaven's sake don't be so desperate!\" Troy said, snappishly,\nrising as he did so, and leaving the room.\n\nDirectly he had gone, Bathsheba burst into great sobs--dry-eyed sobs,\nwhich cut as they came, without any softening by tears.  But she\ndetermined to repress all evidences of feeling.  She was conquered;\nbut she would never own it as long as she lived.  Her pride was\nindeed brought low by despairing discoveries of her spoliation by\nmarriage with a less pure nature than her own.  She chafed to and fro\nin rebelliousness, like a caged leopard; her whole soul was in arms,\nand the blood fired her face.  Until she had met Troy, Bathsheba had\nbeen proud of her position as a woman; it had been a glory to her to\nknow that her lips had been touched by no man's on earth--that her\nwaist had never been encircled by a lover's arm.  She hated herself\nnow.  In those earlier days she had always nourished a secret\ncontempt for girls who were the slaves of the first good-looking\nyoung fellow who should choose to salute them.  She had never taken\nkindly to the idea of marriage in the abstract as did the majority of\nwomen she saw about her.  In the turmoil of her anxiety for her lover\nshe had agreed to marry him; but the perception that had accompanied\nher happiest hours on this account was rather that of self-sacrifice\nthan of promotion and honour.  Although she scarcely knew the\ndivinity's name, Diana was the goddess whom Bathsheba instinctively\nadored.  That she had never, by look, word, or sign, encouraged a man\nto approach her--that she had felt herself sufficient to herself,\nand had in the independence of her girlish heart fancied there was\na certain degradation in renouncing the simplicity of a maiden\nexistence to become the humbler half of an indifferent matrimonial\nwhole--were facts now bitterly remembered.  Oh, if she had never\nstooped to folly of this kind, respectable as it was, and could only\nstand again, as she had stood on the hill at Norcombe, and dare Troy\nor any other man to pollute a hair of her head by his interference!\n\nThe next morning she rose earlier than usual, and had the horse\nsaddled for her ride round the farm in the customary way.  When she\ncame in at half-past eight--their usual hour for breakfasting--she\nwas informed that her husband had risen, taken his breakfast, and\ndriven off to Casterbridge with the gig and Poppet.\n\nAfter breakfast she was cool and collected--quite herself in\nfact--and she rambled to the gate, intending to walk to another\nquarter of the farm, which she still personally superintended as\nwell as her duties in the house would permit, continually, however,\nfinding herself preceded in forethought by Gabriel Oak, for whom she\nbegan to entertain the genuine friendship of a sister.  Of course,\nshe sometimes thought of him in the light of an old lover, and had\nmomentary imaginings of what life with him as a husband would have\nbeen like; also of life with Boldwood under the same conditions.\nBut Bathsheba, though she could feel, was not much given to futile\ndreaming, and her musings under this head were short and entirely\nconfined to the times when Troy's neglect was more than ordinarily\nevident.\n\nShe saw coming up the road a man like Mr. Boldwood.  It was Mr.\nBoldwood.  Bathsheba blushed painfully, and watched.  The farmer\nstopped when still a long way off, and held up his hand to Gabriel\nOak, who was in a footpath across the field.  The two men then\napproached each other and seemed to engage in earnest conversation.\n\nThus they continued for a long time.  Joseph Poorgrass now passed\nnear them, wheeling a barrow of apples up the hill to Bathsheba's\nresidence.  Boldwood and Gabriel called to him, spoke to him for a\nfew minutes, and then all three parted, Joseph immediately coming\nup the hill with his barrow.\n\nBathsheba, who had seen this pantomime with some surprise,\nexperienced great relief when Boldwood turned back again.  \"Well,\nwhat's the message, Joseph?\" she said.\n\nHe set down his barrow, and, putting upon himself the refined aspect\nthat a conversation with a lady required, spoke to Bathsheba over the\ngate.\n\n\"You'll never see Fanny Robin no more--use nor principal--ma'am.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because she's dead in the Union.\"\n\n\"Fanny dead--never!\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\n\"What did she die from?\"\n\n\"I don't know for certain; but I should be inclined to think it was\nfrom general neshness of constitution.  She was such a limber maid\nthat 'a could stand no hardship, even when I knowed her, and 'a went\nlike a candle-snoff, so 'tis said.  She was took bad in the morning,\nand, being quite feeble and worn out, she died in the evening.  She\nbelongs by law to our parish; and Mr. Boldwood is going to send a\nwaggon at three this afternoon to fetch her home here and bury her.\"\n\n\"Indeed I shall not let Mr. Boldwood do any such thing--I shall do\nit!  Fanny was my uncle's servant, and, although I only knew her\nfor a couple of days, she belongs to me.  How very, very sad this\nis!--the idea of Fanny being in a workhouse.\"  Bathsheba had begun to\nknow what suffering was, and she spoke with real feeling....  \"Send\nacross to Mr. Boldwood's, and say that Mrs. Troy will take upon\nherself the duty of fetching an old servant of the family....  We\nought not to put her in a waggon; we'll get a hearse.\"\n\n\"There will hardly be time, ma'am, will there?\"\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" she said, musingly.  \"When did you say we must be at\nthe door--three o'clock?\"\n\n\"Three o'clock this afternoon, ma'am, so to speak it.\"\n\n\"Very well--you go with it.  A pretty waggon is better than an ugly\nhearse, after all.  Joseph, have the new spring waggon with the blue\nbody and red wheels, and wash it very clean.  And, Joseph--\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Carry with you some evergreens and flowers to put upon her\ncoffin--indeed, gather a great many, and completely bury her in\nthem.  Get some boughs of laurustinus, and variegated box, and yew,\nand boy's-love; ay, and some bunches of chrysanthemum.  And let old\nPleasant draw her, because she knew him so well.\"\n\n\"I will, ma'am.  I ought to have said that the Union, in the form of\nfour labouring men, will meet me when I gets to our churchyard gate,\nand take her and bury her according to the rites of the Board of\nGuardians, as by law ordained.\"\n\n\"Dear me--Casterbridge Union--and is Fanny come to this?\" said\nBathsheba, musing.  \"I wish I had known of it sooner.  I thought she\nwas far away.  How long has she lived there?\"\n\n\"On'y been there a day or two.\"\n\n\"Oh!--then she has not been staying there as a regular inmate?\"\n\n\"No.  She first went to live in a garrison-town t'other side o'\nWessex, and since then she's been picking up a living at seampstering\nin Melchester for several months, at the house of a very respectable\nwidow-woman who takes in work of that sort.  She only got handy the\nUnion-house on Sunday morning 'a b'lieve, and 'tis supposed here and\nthere that she had traipsed every step of the way from Melchester.\nWhy she left her place, I can't say, for I don't know; and as to a\nlie, why, I wouldn't tell it.  That's the short of the story, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Ah-h!\"\n\nNo gem ever flashed from a rosy ray to a white one more rapidly than\nchanged the young wife's countenance whilst this word came from her\nin a long-drawn breath.  \"Did she walk along our turnpike-road?\" she\nsaid, in a suddenly restless and eager voice.\n\n\"I believe she did....  Ma'am, shall I call Liddy?  You bain't well,\nma'am, surely?  You look like a lily--so pale and fainty!\"\n\n\"No; don't call her; it is nothing.  When did she pass Weatherbury?\"\n\n\"Last Saturday night.\"\n\n\"That will do, Joseph; now you may go.\"\n\n\"Certainly, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Joseph, come hither a moment.  What was the colour of Fanny Robin's\nhair?\"\n\n\"Really, mistress, now that 'tis put to me so judge-and-jury like, I\ncan't call to mind, if ye'll believe me!\"\n\n\"Never mind; go on and do what I told you.  Stop--well no, go on.\"\n\nShe turned herself away from him, that he might no longer notice the\nmood which had set its sign so visibly upon her, and went indoors\nwith a distressing sense of faintness and a beating brow.  About an\nhour after, she heard the noise of the waggon and went out, still\nwith a painful consciousness of her bewildered and troubled look.\nJoseph, dressed in his best suit of clothes, was putting in the horse\nto start.  The shrubs and flowers were all piled in the waggon, as\nshe had directed; Bathsheba hardly saw them now.\n\n\"Died of what? did you say, Joseph?\"\n\n\"I don't know, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Are you quite sure?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, quite sure.\"\n\n\"Sure of what?\"\n\n\"I'm sure that all I know is that she arrived in the morning and died\nin the evening without further parley.  What Oak and Mr. Boldwood\ntold me was only these few words.  'Little Fanny Robin is dead,\nJoseph,' Gabriel said, looking in my face in his steady old way.\nI was very sorry, and I said, 'Ah!--and how did she come to die?'\n'Well, she's dead in Casterbridge Union,' he said, 'and perhaps\n'tisn't much matter about how she came to die.  She reached the\nUnion early Sunday morning, and died in the afternoon--that's clear\nenough.' Then I asked what she'd been doing lately, and Mr. Boldwood\nturned round to me then, and left off spitting a thistle with the end\nof his stick.  He told me about her having lived by seampstering in\nMelchester, as I mentioned to you, and that she walked therefrom at\nthe end of last week, passing near here Saturday night in the dusk.\nThey then said I had better just name a hint of her death to you, and\naway they went.  Her death might have been brought on by biding in\nthe night wind, you know, ma'am; for people used to say she'd go off\nin a decline: she used to cough a good deal in winter time.  However,\n'tisn't much odds to us about that now, for 'tis all over.\"\n\n\"Have you heard a different story at all?\" She looked at him so\nintently that Joseph's eyes quailed.\n\n\"Not a word, mistress, I assure 'ee!\" he said.  \"Hardly anybody in\nthe parish knows the news yet.\"\n\n\"I wonder why Gabriel didn't bring the message to me himself.  He\nmostly makes a point of seeing me upon the most trifling errand.\"\nThese words were merely murmured, and she was looking upon the\nground.\n\n\"Perhaps he was busy, ma'am,\" Joseph suggested.  \"And sometimes he\nseems to suffer from things upon his mind, connected with the time\nwhen he was better off than 'a is now.  'A's rather a curious item,\nbut a very understanding shepherd, and learned in books.\"\n\n\"Did anything seem upon his mind whilst he was speaking to you about\nthis?\"\n\n\"I cannot but say that there did, ma'am.  He was terrible down, and\nso was Farmer Boldwood.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Joseph.  That will do.  Go on now, or you'll be late.\"\n\nBathsheba, still unhappy, went indoors again.  In the course of the\nafternoon she said to Liddy, who had been informed of the occurrence,\n\"What was the colour of poor Fanny Robin's hair?  Do you know?  I\ncannot recollect--I only saw her for a day or two.\"\n\n\"It was light, ma'am; but she wore it rather short, and packed away\nunder her cap, so that you would hardly notice it.  But I have seen\nher let it down when she was going to bed, and it looked beautiful\nthen.  Real golden hair.\"\n\n\"Her young man was a soldier, was he not?\"\n\n\"Yes.  In the same regiment as Mr. Troy.  He says he knew him very\nwell.\"\n\n\"What, Mr. Troy says so?  How came he to say that?\"\n\n\"One day I just named it to him, and asked him if he knew Fanny's\nyoung man.  He said, 'Oh yes, he knew the young man as well as he\nknew himself, and that there wasn't a man in the regiment he liked\nbetter.'\"\n\n\"Ah!  Said that, did he?\"\n\n\"Yes; and he said there was a strong likeness between himself and the\nother young man, so that sometimes people mistook them--\"\n\n\"Liddy, for Heaven's sake stop your talking!\" said Bathsheba, with\nthe nervous petulance that comes from worrying perceptions.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\n\nJOSEPH AND HIS BURDEN--BUCK'S HEAD\n\n\nA wall bounded the site of Casterbridge Union-house, except along a\nportion of the end.  Here a high gable stood prominent, and it was\ncovered like the front with a mat of ivy.  In this gable was no\nwindow, chimney, ornament, or protuberance of any kind.  The single\nfeature appertaining to it, beyond the expanse of dark green leaves,\nwas a small door.\n\nThe situation of the door was peculiar.  The sill was three or four\nfeet above the ground, and for a moment one was at a loss for an\nexplanation of this exceptional altitude, till ruts immediately\nbeneath suggested that the door was used solely for the passage of\narticles and persons to and from the level of a vehicle standing on\nthe outside.  Upon the whole, the door seemed to advertise itself as\na species of Traitor's Gate translated to another sphere.  That entry\nand exit hereby was only at rare intervals became apparent on noting\nthat tufts of grass were allowed to flourish undisturbed in the\nchinks of the sill.\n\nAs the clock over the South-street Alms-house pointed to five minutes\nto three, a blue spring waggon, picked out with red, and containing\nboughs and flowers, passed the end of the street, and up towards this\nside of the building.  Whilst the chimes were yet stammering out a\nshattered form of \"Malbrook,\" Joseph Poorgrass rang the bell, and\nreceived directions to back his waggon against the high door under\nthe gable.  The door then opened, and a plain elm coffin was slowly\nthrust forth, and laid by two men in fustian along the middle of the\nvehicle.\n\nOne of the men then stepped up beside it, took from his pocket a lump\nof chalk, and wrote upon the cover the name and a few other words in\na large scrawling hand.  (We believe that they do these things more\ntenderly now, and provide a plate.) He covered the whole with a\nblack cloth, threadbare, but decent, the tail-board of the waggon\nwas returned to its place, one of the men handed a certificate of\nregistry to Poorgrass, and both entered the door, closing it behind\nthem.  Their connection with her, short as it had been, was over for\never.\n\nJoseph then placed the flowers as enjoined, and the evergreens\naround the flowers, till it was difficult to divine what the waggon\ncontained; he smacked his whip, and the rather pleasing funeral car\ncrept down the hill, and along the road to Weatherbury.\n\nThe afternoon drew on apace, and, looking to the right towards the\nsea as he walked beside the horse, Poorgrass saw strange clouds and\nscrolls of mist rolling over the long ridges which girt the landscape\nin that quarter.  They came in yet greater volumes, and indolently\ncrept across the intervening valleys, and around the withered papery\nflags of the moor and river brinks.  Then their dank spongy forms\nclosed in upon the sky.  It was a sudden overgrowth of atmospheric\nfungi which had their roots in the neighbouring sea, and by the time\nthat horse, man, and corpse entered Yalbury Great Wood, these silent\nworkings of an invisible hand had reached them, and they were\ncompletely enveloped, this being the first arrival of the autumn\nfogs, and the first fog of the series.\n\nThe air was as an eye suddenly struck blind.  The waggon and its load\nrolled no longer on the horizontal division between clearness and\nopacity, but were imbedded in an elastic body of a monotonous pallor\nthroughout.  There was no perceptible motion in the air, not a\nvisible drop of water fell upon a leaf of the beeches, birches,\nand firs composing the wood on either side.  The trees stood in an\nattitude of intentness, as if they waited longingly for a wind to\ncome and rock them.  A startling quiet overhung all surrounding\nthings--so completely, that the crunching of the waggon-wheels\nwas as a great noise, and small rustles, which had never obtained\na hearing except by night, were distinctly individualized.\n\nJoseph Poorgrass looked round upon his sad burden as it loomed\nfaintly through the flowering laurustinus, then at the unfathomable\ngloom amid the high trees on each hand, indistinct, shadowless, and\nspectre-like in their monochrome of grey.  He felt anything but\ncheerful, and wished he had the company even of a child or dog.\nStopping the horse, he listened.  Not a footstep or wheel was audible\nanywhere around, and the dead silence was broken only by a heavy\nparticle falling from a tree through the evergreens and alighting\nwith a smart rap upon the coffin of poor Fanny.  The fog had by this\ntime saturated the trees, and this was the first dropping of water\nfrom the overbrimming leaves.  The hollow echo of its fall reminded\nthe waggoner painfully of the grim Leveller.  Then hard by came down\nanother drop, then two or three.  Presently there was a continual\ntapping of these heavy drops upon the dead leaves, the road, and\nthe travellers.  The nearer boughs were beaded with the mist to the\ngreyness of aged men, and the rusty-red leaves of the beeches were\nhung with similar drops, like diamonds on auburn hair.\n\nAt the roadside hamlet called Roy-Town, just beyond this wood,\nwas the old inn Buck's Head.  It was about a mile and a half from\nWeatherbury, and in the meridian times of stage-coach travelling\nhad been the place where many coaches changed and kept their relays\nof horses.  All the old stabling was now pulled down, and little\nremained besides the habitable inn itself, which, standing a little\nway back from the road, signified its existence to people far up and\ndown the highway by a sign hanging from the horizontal bough of an\nelm on the opposite side of the way.\n\nTravellers--for the variety _tourist_ had hardly developed into a\ndistinct species at this date--sometimes said in passing, when they\ncast their eyes up to the sign-bearing tree, that artists were fond\nof representing the signboard hanging thus, but that they themselves\nhad never before noticed so perfect an instance in actual working\norder.  It was near this tree that the waggon was standing into which\nGabriel Oak crept on his first journey to Weatherbury; but, owing to\nthe darkness, the sign and the inn had been unobserved.\n\nThe manners of the inn were of the old-established type.  Indeed,\nin the minds of its frequenters they existed as unalterable formul\u00c3\u00a6:\n_e.g._--\n\n\n   Rap with the bottom of your pint for more liquor.\n   For tobacco, shout.\n   In calling for the girl in waiting, say, \"Maid!\"\n   Ditto for the landlady, \"Old Soul!\" etc., etc.\n\n\nIt was a relief to Joseph's heart when the friendly signboard came in\nview, and, stopping his horse immediately beneath it, he proceeded to\nfulfil an intention made a long time before.  His spirits were oozing\nout of him quite.  He turned the horse's head to the green bank, and\nentered the hostel for a mug of ale.\n\nGoing down into the kitchen of the inn, the floor of which was a\nstep below the passage, which in its turn was a step below the\nroad outside, what should Joseph see to gladden his eyes but two\ncopper-coloured discs, in the form of the countenances of Mr. Jan\nCoggan and Mr. Mark Clark.  These owners of the two most appreciative\nthroats in the neighbourhood, within the pale of respectability, were\nnow sitting face to face over a three-legged circular table, having\nan iron rim to keep cups and pots from being accidentally elbowed\noff; they might have been said to resemble the setting sun and the\nfull moon shining _vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis_ across the globe.\n\n\"Why, 'tis neighbour Poorgrass!\" said Mark Clark.  \"I'm sure your\nface don't praise your mistress's table, Joseph.\"\n\n\"I've had a very pale companion for the last four miles,\" said\nJoseph, indulging in a shudder toned down by resignation.  \"And to\nspeak the truth, 'twas beginning to tell upon me.  I assure ye, I\nha'n't seed the colour of victuals or drink since breakfast time\nthis morning, and that was no more than a dew-bit afield.\"\n\n\"Then drink, Joseph, and don't restrain yourself!\" said Coggan,\nhanding him a hooped mug three-quarters full.\n\nJoseph drank for a moderately long time, then for a longer time,\nsaying, as he lowered the jug, \"'Tis pretty drinking--very pretty\ndrinking, and is more than cheerful on my melancholy errand, so to\nspeak it.\"\n\n\"True, drink is a pleasant delight,\" said Jan, as one who repeated a\ntruism so familiar to his brain that he hardly noticed its passage\nover his tongue; and, lifting the cup, Coggan tilted his head\ngradually backwards, with closed eyes, that his expectant soul\nmight not be diverted for one instant from its bliss by irrelevant\nsurroundings.\n\n\"Well, I must be on again,\" said Poorgrass.  \"Not but that I should\nlike another nip with ye; but the parish might lose confidence in me\nif I was seed here.\"\n\n\"Where be ye trading o't to to-day, then, Joseph?\"\n\n\"Back to Weatherbury.  I've got poor little Fanny Robin in my waggon\noutside, and I must be at the churchyard gates at a quarter to five\nwith her.\"\n\n\"Ay--I've heard of it.  And so she's nailed up in parish boards after\nall, and nobody to pay the bell shilling and the grave half-crown.\"\n\n\"The parish pays the grave half-crown, but not the bell shilling,\nbecause the bell's a luxery: but 'a can hardly do without the grave,\npoor body.  However, I expect our mistress will pay all.\"\n\n\"A pretty maid as ever I see!  But what's yer hurry, Joseph?  The\npore woman's dead, and you can't bring her to life, and you may as\nwell sit down comfortable, and finish another with us.\"\n\n\"I don't mind taking just the least thimbleful ye can dream of more\nwith ye, sonnies.  But only a few minutes, because 'tis as 'tis.\"\n\n\"Of course, you'll have another drop.  A man's twice the man\nafterwards.  You feel so warm and glorious, and you whop and slap at\nyour work without any trouble, and everything goes on like sticks\na-breaking.  Too much liquor is bad, and leads us to that horned man\nin the smoky house; but after all, many people haven't the gift of\nenjoying a wet, and since we be highly favoured with a power that\nway, we should make the most o't.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Mark Clark.  \"'Tis a talent the Lord has mercifully\nbestowed upon us, and we ought not to neglect it. But, what with the\nparsons and clerks and school-people and serious tea-parties, the\nmerry old ways of good life have gone to the dogs--upon my carcase,\nthey have!\"\n\n\"Well, really, I must be onward again now,\" said Joseph.\n\n\"Now, now, Joseph; nonsense!  The poor woman is dead, isn't she, and\nwhat's your hurry?\"\n\n\"Well, I hope Providence won't be in a way with me for my doings,\"\nsaid Joseph, again sitting down.  \"I've been troubled with weak\nmoments lately, 'tis true.  I've been drinky once this month already,\nand I did not go to church a-Sunday, and I dropped a curse or two\nyesterday; so I don't want to go too far for my safety.  Your next\nworld is your next world, and not to be squandered offhand.\"\n\n\"I believe ye to be a chapelmember, Joseph.  That I do.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no!  I don't go so far as that.\"\n\n\"For my part,\" said Coggan, \"I'm staunch Church of England.\"\n\n\"Ay, and faith, so be I,\" said Mark Clark.\n\n\"I won't say much for myself; I don't wish to,\" Coggan continued,\nwith that tendency to talk on principles which is characteristic of\nthe barley-corn.  \"But I've never changed a single doctrine: I've\nstuck like a plaster to the old faith I was born in.  Yes; there's\nthis to be said for the Church, a man can belong to the Church and\nbide in his cheerful old inn, and never trouble or worry his mind\nabout doctrines at all.  But to be a meetinger, you must go to chapel\nin all winds and weathers, and make yerself as frantic as a skit.\nNot but that chapel members be clever chaps enough in their way.\nThey can lift up beautiful prayers out of their own heads, all about\ntheir families and shipwrecks in the newspaper.\"\n\n\"They can--they can,\" said Mark Clark, with corroborative feeling;\n\"but we Churchmen, you see, must have it all printed aforehand, or,\ndang it all, we should no more know what to say to a great gaffer\nlike the Lord than babes unborn.\"\n\n\"Chapelfolk be more hand-in-glove with them above than we,\" said\nJoseph, thoughtfully.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Coggan.  \"We know very well that if anybody do go to\nheaven, they will.  They've worked hard for it, and they deserve to\nhave it, such as 'tis.  I bain't such a fool as to pretend that we\nwho stick to the Church have the same chance as they, because we\nknow we have not.  But I hate a feller who'll change his old ancient\ndoctrines for the sake of getting to heaven.  I'd as soon turn\nking's-evidence for the few pounds you get.  Why, neighbours, when\nevery one of my taties were frosted, our Parson Thirdly were the man\nwho gave me a sack for seed, though he hardly had one for his own\nuse, and no money to buy 'em.  If it hadn't been for him, I shouldn't\nhae had a tatie to put in my garden.  D'ye think I'd turn after that?\nNo, I'll stick to my side; and if we be in the wrong, so be it: I'll\nfall with the fallen!\"\n\n\"Well said--very well said,\" observed Joseph.--\"However, folks, I\nmust be moving now: upon my life I must.  Pa'son Thirdly will be\nwaiting at the church gates, and there's the woman a-biding outside\nin the waggon.\"\n\n\"Joseph Poorgrass, don't be so miserable!  Pa'son Thirdly won't mind.\nHe's a generous man; he's found me in tracts for years, and I've\nconsumed a good many in the course of a long and shady life; but he's\nnever been the man to cry out at the expense.  Sit down.\"\n\nThe longer Joseph Poorgrass remained, the less his spirit was\ntroubled by the duties which devolved upon him this afternoon.\nThe minutes glided by uncounted, until the evening shades began\nperceptibly to deepen, and the eyes of the three were but sparkling\npoints on the surface of darkness.  Coggan's repeater struck six\nfrom his pocket in the usual still small tones.\n\nAt that moment hasty steps were heard in the entry, and the door\nopened to admit the figure of Gabriel Oak, followed by the maid of\nthe inn bearing a candle.  He stared sternly at the one lengthy\nand two round faces of the sitters, which confronted him with the\nexpressions of a fiddle and a couple of warming-pans.  Joseph\nPoorgrass blinked, and shrank several inches into the background.\n\n\"Upon my soul, I'm ashamed of you; 'tis disgraceful, Joseph,\ndisgraceful!\" said Gabriel, indignantly.  \"Coggan, you call yourself\na man, and don't know better than this.\"\n\nCoggan looked up indefinitely at Oak, one or other of his eyes\noccasionally opening and closing of its own accord, as if it were not\na member, but a dozy individual with a distinct personality.\n\n\"Don't take on so, shepherd!\" said Mark Clark, looking reproachfully\nat the candle, which appeared to possess special features of interest\nfor his eyes.\n\n\"Nobody can hurt a dead woman,\" at length said Coggan, with the\nprecision of a machine.  \"All that could be done for her is\ndone--she's beyond us: and why should a man put himself in a tearing\nhurry for lifeless clay that can neither feel nor see, and don't know\nwhat you do with her at all?  If she'd been alive, I would have been\nthe first to help her.  If she now wanted victuals and drink, I'd pay\nfor it, money down.  But she's dead, and no speed of ours will bring\nher to life.  The woman's past us--time spent upon her is throwed\naway: why should we hurry to do what's not required?  Drink,\nshepherd, and be friends, for to-morrow we may be like her.\"\n\n\"We may,\" added Mark Clark, emphatically, at once drinking himself,\nto run no further risk of losing his chance by the event alluded\nto, Jan meanwhile merging his additional thoughts of to-morrow in a\nsong:--\n\n\n                          To-mor-row, to-mor-row!\n    And while peace and plen-ty I find at my board,\n       With a heart free from sick-ness and sor-row,\n    With my friends will I share what to-day may af-ford,\n       And let them spread the ta-ble to-mor-row.\n                          To-mor-row', to-mor--\n\n\n\"Do hold thy horning, Jan!\" said Oak; and turning upon Poorgrass, \"as\nfor you, Joseph, who do your wicked deeds in such confoundedly holy\nways, you are as drunk as you can stand.\"\n\n\"No, Shepherd Oak, no!  Listen to reason, shepherd.  All that's the\nmatter with me is the affliction called a multiplying eye, and that's\nhow it is I look double to you--I mean, you look double to me.\"\n\n\"A multiplying eye is a very bad thing,\" said Mark Clark.\n\n\"It always comes on when I have been in a public-house a little\ntime,\" said Joseph Poorgrass, meekly.  \"Yes; I see two of every\nsort, as if I were some holy man living in the times of King Noah\nand entering into the ark....  Y-y-y-yes,\" he added, becoming much\naffected by the picture of himself as a person thrown away, and\nshedding tears; \"I feel too good for England: I ought to have lived\nin Genesis by rights, like the other men of sacrifice, and then I\nshouldn't have b-b-been called a d-d-drunkard in such a way!\"\n\n\"I wish you'd show yourself a man of spirit, and not sit whining\nthere!\"\n\n\"Show myself a man of spirit? ...  Ah, well! let me take the name of\ndrunkard humbly--let me be a man of contrite knees--let it be!  I\nknow that I always do say 'Please God' afore I do anything, from my\ngetting up to my going down of the same, and I be willing to take as\nmuch disgrace as there is in that holy act.  Hah, yes! ...  But not\na man of spirit?  Have I ever allowed the toe of pride to be lifted\nagainst my hinder parts without groaning manfully that I question\nthe right to do so?  I inquire that query boldly?\"\n\n\"We can't say that you have, Hero Poorgrass,\" admitted Jan.\n\n\"Never have I allowed such treatment to pass unquestioned!  Yet the\nshepherd says in the face of that rich testimony that I be not a man\nof spirit!  Well, let it pass by, and death is a kind friend!\"\n\nGabriel, seeing that neither of the three was in a fit state to take\ncharge of the waggon for the remainder of the journey, made no reply,\nbut, closing the door again upon them, went across to where the\nvehicle stood, now getting indistinct in the fog and gloom of this\nmildewy time.  He pulled the horse's head from the large patch of\nturf it had eaten bare, readjusted the boughs over the coffin, and\ndrove along through the unwholesome night.\n\nIt had gradually become rumoured in the village that the body to be\nbrought and buried that day was all that was left of the unfortunate\nFanny Robin who had followed the Eleventh from Casterbridge through\nMelchester and onwards.  But, thanks to Boldwood's reticence\nand Oak's generosity, the lover she had followed had never been\nindividualized as Troy.  Gabriel hoped that the whole truth of the\nmatter might not be published till at any rate the girl had been in\nher grave for a few days, when the interposing barriers of earth\nand time, and a sense that the events had been somewhat shut into\noblivion, would deaden the sting that revelation and invidious\nremark would have for Bathsheba just now.\n\nBy the time that Gabriel reached the old manor-house, her residence,\nwhich lay in his way to the church, it was quite dark.  A man came\nfrom the gate and said through the fog, which hung between them like\nblown flour--\n\n\"Is that Poorgrass with the corpse?\"\n\nGabriel recognized the voice as that of the parson.\n\n\"The corpse is here, sir,\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"I have just been to inquire of Mrs. Troy if she could tell me the\nreason of the delay.  I am afraid it is too late now for the funeral\nto be performed with proper decency.  Have you the registrar's\ncertificate?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Gabriel.  \"I expect Poorgrass has that; and he's at the\nBuck's Head.  I forgot to ask him for it.\"\n\n\"Then that settles the matter.  We'll put off the funeral till\nto-morrow morning.  The body may be brought on to the church, or\nit may be left here at the farm and fetched by the bearers in the\nmorning. They waited more than an hour, and have now gone home.\"\n\nGabriel had his reasons for thinking the latter a most objectionable\nplan, notwithstanding that Fanny had been an inmate of the farm-house\nfor several years in the lifetime of Bathsheba's uncle.  Visions\nof several unhappy contingencies which might arise from this delay\nflitted before him.  But his will was not law, and he went indoors\nto inquire of his mistress what were her wishes on the subject.  He\nfound her in an unusual mood: her eyes as she looked up to him were\nsuspicious and perplexed as with some antecedent thought.  Troy\nhad not yet returned.  At first Bathsheba assented with a mien of\nindifference to his proposition that they should go on to the church\nat once with their burden; but immediately afterwards, following\nGabriel to the gate, she swerved to the extreme of solicitousness on\nFanny's account, and desired that the girl might be brought into the\nhouse.  Oak argued upon the convenience of leaving her in the waggon,\njust as she lay now, with her flowers and green leaves about her,\nmerely wheeling the vehicle into the coach-house till the morning,\nbut to no purpose.  \"It is unkind and unchristian,\" she said, \"to\nleave the poor thing in a coach-house all night.\"\n\n\"Very well, then,\" said the parson.  \"And I will arrange that the\nfuneral shall take place early to-morrow.  Perhaps Mrs. Troy is\nright in feeling that we cannot treat a dead fellow-creature too\nthoughtfully.  We must remember that though she may have erred\ngrievously in leaving her home, she is still our sister: and it is\nto be believed that God's uncovenanted mercies are extended towards\nher, and that she is a member of the flock of Christ.\"\n\nThe parson's words spread into the heavy air with a sad yet\nunperturbed cadence, and Gabriel shed an honest tear.  Bathsheba\nseemed unmoved.  Mr. Thirdly then left them, and Gabriel lighted\na lantern.  Fetching three other men to assist him, they bore the\nunconscious truant indoors, placing the coffin on two benches in the\nmiddle of a little sitting-room next the hall, as Bathsheba directed.\n\nEvery one except Gabriel Oak then left the room.  He still\nindecisively lingered beside the body.  He was deeply troubled at the\nwretchedly ironical aspect that circumstances were putting on with\nregard to Troy's wife, and at his own powerlessness to counteract\nthem.  In spite of his careful manoeuvering all this day, the very\nworst event that could in any way have happened in connection with\nthe burial had happened now.  Oak imagined a terrible discovery\nresulting from this afternoon's work that might cast over Bathsheba's\nlife a shade which the interposition of many lapsing years might but\nindifferently lighten, and which nothing at all might altogether\nremove.\n\nSuddenly, as in a last attempt to save Bathsheba from, at any rate,\nimmediate anguish, he looked again, as he had looked before, at the\nchalk writing upon the coffin-lid.  The scrawl was this simple one,\n\"FANNY ROBIN AND CHILD.\"  Gabriel took his handkerchief and carefully\nrubbed out the two latter words, leaving visible the inscription\n\"FANNY ROBIN\" only.  He then left the room, and went out quietly by\nthe front door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\n\nFANNY'S REVENGE\n\n\n\"Do you want me any longer ma'am?\" inquired Liddy, at a later hour\nthe same evening, standing by the door with a chamber candlestick in\nher hand and addressing Bathsheba, who sat cheerless and alone in the\nlarge parlour beside the first fire of the season.\n\n\"No more to-night, Liddy.\"\n\n\"I'll sit up for master if you like, ma'am.  I am not at all afraid\nof Fanny, if I may sit in my own room and have a candle.  She was\nsuch a childlike, nesh young thing that her spirit couldn't appear\nto anybody if it tried, I'm quite sure.\"\n\n\"Oh no, no!  You go to bed.  I'll sit up for him myself till twelve\no'clock, and if he has not arrived by that time, I shall give him up\nand go to bed too.\"\n\n\"It is half-past ten now.\"\n\n\"Oh! is it?\"\n\n\"Why don't you sit upstairs, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Why don't I?\" said Bathsheba, desultorily.  \"It isn't worth\nwhile--there's a fire here, Liddy.\"  She suddenly exclaimed in an\nimpulsive and excited whisper, \"Have you heard anything strange said\nof Fanny?\" The words had no sooner escaped her than an expression of\nunutterable regret crossed her face, and she burst into tears.\n\n\"No--not a word!\" said Liddy, looking at the weeping woman with\nastonishment.  \"What is it makes you cry so, ma'am; has anything hurt\nyou?\"  She came to Bathsheba's side with a face full of sympathy.\n\n\"No, Liddy--I don't want you any more.  I can hardly say why I have\ntaken to crying lately: I never used to cry.  Good-night.\"\n\nLiddy then left the parlour and closed the door.\n\nBathsheba was lonely and miserable now; not lonelier actually than\nshe had been before her marriage; but her loneliness then was to that\nof the present time as the solitude of a mountain is to the solitude\nof a cave.  And within the last day or two had come these disquieting\nthoughts about her husband's past.  Her wayward sentiment that\nevening concerning Fanny's temporary resting-place had been the\nresult of a strange complication of impulses in Bathsheba's bosom.\nPerhaps it would be more accurately described as a determined\nrebellion against her prejudices, a revulsion from a lower instinct\nof uncharitableness, which would have withheld all sympathy from\nthe dead woman, because in life she had preceded Bathsheba in the\nattentions of a man whom Bathsheba had by no means ceased from\nloving, though her love was sick to death just now with the gravity\nof a further misgiving.\n\nIn five or ten minutes there was another tap at the door.  Liddy\nreappeared, and coming in a little way stood hesitating, until at\nlength she said, \"Maryann has just heard something very strange, but\nI know it isn't true.  And we shall be sure to know the rights of it\nin a day or two.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing connected with you or us, ma'am.  It is about Fanny.\nThat same thing you have heard.\"\n\n\"I have heard nothing.\"\n\n\"I mean that a wicked story is got to Weatherbury within this last\nhour--that--\"  Liddy came close to her mistress and whispered the\nremainder of the sentence slowly into her ear, inclining her head as\nshe spoke in the direction of the room where Fanny lay.\n\nBathsheba trembled from head to foot.\n\n\"I don't believe it!\" she said, excitedly.  \"And there's only one\nname written on the coffin-cover.\"\n\n\"Nor I, ma'am.  And a good many others don't; for we should surely\nhave been told more about it if it had been true--don't you think so,\nma'am?\"\n\n\"We might or we might not.\"\n\nBathsheba turned and looked into the fire, that Liddy might not see\nher face.  Finding that her mistress was going to say no more, Liddy\nglided out, closed the door softly, and went to bed.\n\nBathsheba's face, as she continued looking into the fire that\nevening, might have excited solicitousness on her account even among\nthose who loved her least.  The sadness of Fanny Robin's fate did not\nmake Bathsheba's glorious, although she was the Esther to this poor\nVashti, and their fates might be supposed to stand in some respects\nas contrasts to each other.  When Liddy came into the room a second\ntime the beautiful eyes which met hers had worn a listless, weary\nlook.  When she went out after telling the story they had expressed\nwretchedness in full activity.  Her simple country nature, fed on\nold-fashioned principles, was troubled by that which would have\ntroubled a woman of the world very little, both Fanny and her child,\nif she had one, being dead.\n\nBathsheba had grounds for conjecturing a connection between her own\nhistory and the dimly suspected tragedy of Fanny's end which Oak\nand Boldwood never for a moment credited her with possessing.  The\nmeeting with the lonely woman on the previous Saturday night had been\nunwitnessed and unspoken of.  Oak may have had the best of intentions\nin withholding for as many days as possible the details of what had\nhappened to Fanny; but had he known that Bathsheba's perceptions had\nalready been exercised in the matter, he would have done nothing to\nlengthen the minutes of suspense she was now undergoing, when the\ncertainty which must terminate it would be the worst fact suspected\nafter all.\n\nShe suddenly felt a longing desire to speak to some one stronger than\nherself, and so get strength to sustain her surmised position with\ndignity and her lurking doubts with stoicism.  Where could she find\nsuch a friend? nowhere in the house.  She was by far the coolest of\nthe women under her roof.  Patience and suspension of judgement for\na few hours were what she wanted to learn, and there was nobody to\nteach her.  Might she but go to Gabriel Oak!--but that could not be.\nWhat a way Oak had, she thought, of enduring things.  Boldwood,\nwho seemed so much deeper and higher and stronger in feeling than\nGabriel, had not yet learnt, any more than she herself, the simple\nlesson which Oak showed a mastery of by every turn and look he\ngave--that among the multitude of interests by which he was\nsurrounded, those which affected his personal well-being were not the\nmost absorbing and important in his eyes.  Oak meditatively looked\nupon the horizon of circumstances without any special regard to his\nown standpoint in the midst.  That was how she would wish to be.  But\nthen Oak was not racked by incertitude upon the inmost matter of his\nbosom, as she was at this moment.  Oak knew all about Fanny that he\nwished to know--she felt convinced of that.  If she were to go to him\nnow at once and say no more than these few words, \"What is the truth\nof the story?\" he would feel bound in honour to tell her.  It would\nbe an inexpressible relief.  No further speech would need to be\nuttered.  He knew her so well that no eccentricity of behaviour in\nher would alarm him.\n\nShe flung a cloak round her, went to the door and opened it.  Every\nblade, every twig was still.  The air was yet thick with moisture,\nthough somewhat less dense than during the afternoon, and a steady\nsmack of drops upon the fallen leaves under the boughs was almost\nmusical in its soothing regularity.  It seemed better to be out of\nthe house than within it, and Bathsheba closed the door, and walked\nslowly down the lane till she came opposite to Gabriel's cottage,\nwhere he now lived alone, having left Coggan's house through being\npinched for room.  There was a light in one window only, and that\nwas downstairs.  The shutters were not closed, nor was any blind or\ncurtain drawn over the window, neither robbery nor observation being\na contingency which could do much injury to the occupant of the\ndomicile.  Yes, it was Gabriel himself who was sitting up: he was\nreading.  From her standing-place in the road she could see him\nplainly, sitting quite still, his light curly head upon his hand, and\nonly occasionally looking up to snuff the candle which stood beside\nhim.  At length he looked at the clock, seemed surprised at the\nlateness of the hour, closed his book, and arose.  He was going to\nbed, she knew, and if she tapped it must be done at once.\n\nAlas for her resolve!  She felt she could not do it.  Not for worlds\nnow could she give a hint about her misery to him, much less ask him\nplainly for information on the cause of Fanny's death.  She must\nsuspect, and guess, and chafe, and bear it all alone.\n\nLike a homeless wanderer she lingered by the bank, as if lulled and\nfascinated by the atmosphere of content which seemed to spread from\nthat little dwelling, and was so sadly lacking in her own.  Gabriel\nappeared in an upper room, placed his light in the window-bench,\nand then--knelt down to pray.  The contrast of the picture with her\nrebellious and agitated existence at this same time was too much for\nher to bear to look upon longer.  It was not for her to make a truce\nwith trouble by any such means.  She must tread her giddy distracting\nmeasure to its last note, as she had begun it.  With a swollen heart\nshe went again up the lane, and entered her own door.\n\nMore fevered now by a reaction from the first feelings which Oak's\nexample had raised in her, she paused in the hall, looking at the\ndoor of the room wherein Fanny lay.  She locked her fingers, threw\nback her head, and strained her hot hands rigidly across her\nforehead, saying, with a hysterical sob, \"Would to God you would\nspeak and tell me your secret, Fanny! ... Oh, I hope, hope it is not\ntrue that there are two of you! ... If I could only look in upon you\nfor one little minute, I should know all!\"\n\nA few moments passed, and she added, slowly, \"AND I WILL.\"\n\nBathsheba in after times could never gauge the mood which carried\nher through the actions following this murmured resolution on this\nmemorable evening of her life.  She went to the lumber-closet for a\nscrew-driver.  At the end of a short though undefined time she found\nherself in the small room, quivering with emotion, a mist before her\neyes, and an excruciating pulsation in her brain, standing beside the\nuncovered coffin of the girl whose conjectured end had so entirely\nengrossed her, and saying to herself in a husky voice as she gazed\nwithin--\n\n\"It was best to know the worst, and I know it now!\"\n\nShe was conscious of having brought about this situation by a series\nof actions done as by one in an extravagant dream; of following that\nidea as to method, which had burst upon her in the hall with glaring\nobviousness, by gliding to the top of the stairs, assuring herself by\nlistening to the heavy breathing of her maids that they were asleep,\ngliding down again, turning the handle of the door within which the\nyoung girl lay, and deliberately setting herself to do what, if she\nhad anticipated any such undertaking at night and alone, would have\nhorrified her, but which, when done, was not so dreadful as was the\nconclusive proof of her husband's conduct which came with knowing\nbeyond doubt the last chapter of Fanny's story.\n\nBathsheba's head sank upon her bosom, and the breath which had been\nbated in suspense, curiosity, and interest, was exhaled now in the\nform of a whispered wail: \"Oh-h-h!\" she said, and the silent room\nadded length to her moan.\n\nHer tears fell fast beside the unconscious pair in the coffin:\ntears of a complicated origin, of a nature indescribable, almost\nindefinable except as other than those of simple sorrow.  Assuredly\ntheir wonted fires must have lived in Fanny's ashes when events were\nso shaped as to chariot her hither in this natural, unobtrusive, yet\neffectual manner.  The one feat alone--that of dying--by which a mean\ncondition could be resolved into a grand one, Fanny had achieved.\nAnd to that had destiny subjoined this reencounter to-night, which\nhad, in Bathsheba's wild imagining, turned her companion's failure to\nsuccess, her humiliation to triumph, her lucklessness to ascendency;\nit had thrown over herself a garish light of mockery, and set upon\nall things about her an ironical smile.\n\nFanny's face was framed in by that yellow hair of hers; and there was\nno longer much room for doubt as to the origin of the curl owned by\nTroy.  In Bathsheba's heated fancy the innocent white countenance\nexpressed a dim triumphant consciousness of the pain she was\nretaliating for her pain with all the merciless rigour of the Mosaic\nlaw: \"Burning for burning; wound for wound: strife for strife.\"\n\nBathsheba indulged in contemplations of escape from her position by\nimmediate death, which, thought she, though it was an inconvenient\nand awful way, had limits to its inconvenience and awfulness that\ncould not be overpassed; whilst the shames of life were measureless.\nYet even this scheme of extinction by death was but tamely copying\nher rival's method without the reasons which had glorified it in her\nrival's case.  She glided rapidly up and down the room, as was mostly\nher habit when excited, her hands hanging clasped in front of her, as\nshe thought and in part expressed in broken words: \"O, I hate her,\nyet I don't mean that I hate her, for it is grievous and wicked; and\nyet I hate her a little!  Yes, my flesh insists upon hating her,\nwhether my spirit is willing or no! ... If she had only lived, I\ncould have been angry and cruel towards her with some justification;\nbut to be vindictive towards a poor dead woman recoils upon myself.\nO God, have mercy!  I am miserable at all this!\"\n\nBathsheba became at this moment so terrified at her own state of mind\nthat she looked around for some sort of refuge from herself.  The\nvision of Oak kneeling down that night recurred to her, and with the\nimitative instinct which animates women she seized upon the idea,\nresolved to kneel, and, if possible, pray.  Gabriel had prayed; so\nwould she.\n\nShe knelt beside the coffin, covered her face with her hands, and\nfor a time the room was silent as a tomb.  Whether from a purely\nmechanical, or from any other cause, when Bathsheba arose it was with\na quieted spirit, and a regret for the antagonistic instincts which\nhad seized upon her just before.\n\nIn her desire to make atonement she took flowers from a vase by the\nwindow, and began laying them around the dead girl's head.  Bathsheba\nknew no other way of showing kindness to persons departed than by\ngiving them flowers.  She knew not how long she remained engaged\nthus.  She forgot time, life, where she was, what she was doing.  A\nslamming together of the coach-house doors in the yard brought her to\nherself again.  An instant after, the front door opened and closed,\nsteps crossed the hall, and her husband appeared at the entrance to\nthe room, looking in upon her.\n\nHe beheld it all by degrees, stared in stupefaction at the scene, as\nif he thought it an illusion raised by some fiendish incantation.\nBathsheba, pallid as a corpse on end, gazed back at him in the same\nwild way.\n\nSo little are instinctive guesses the fruit of a legitimate induction\nthat, at this moment, as he stood with the door in his hand, Troy\nnever once thought of Fanny in connection with what he saw.  His\nfirst confused idea was that somebody in the house had died.\n\n\"Well--what?\" said Troy, blankly.\n\n\"I must go!  I must go!\" said Bathsheba, to herself more than to him.\nShe came with a dilated eye towards the door, to push past him.\n\n\"What's the matter, in God's name? who's dead?\" said Troy.\n\n\"I cannot say; let me go out.  I want air!\" she continued.\n\n\"But no; stay, I insist!\"  He seized her hand, and then volition\nseemed to leave her, and she went off into a state of passivity.  He,\nstill holding her, came up the room, and thus, hand in hand, Troy and\nBathsheba approached the coffin's side.\n\nThe candle was standing on a bureau close by them, and the light\nslanted down, distinctly enkindling the cold features of both mother\nand babe.  Troy looked in, dropped his wife's hand, knowledge of it\nall came over him in a lurid sheen, and he stood still.\n\nSo still he remained that he could be imagined to have left in him no\nmotive power whatever.  The clashes of feeling in all directions\nconfounded one another, produced a neutrality, and there was motion\nin none.\n\n\"Do you know her?\" said Bathsheba, in a small enclosed echo, as from\nthe interior of a cell.\n\n\"I do,\" said Troy.\n\n\"Is it she?\"\n\n\"It is.\"\n\nHe had originally stood perfectly erect.  And now, in the well-nigh\ncongealed immobility of his frame could be discerned an incipient\nmovement, as in the darkest night may be discerned light after a\nwhile.  He was gradually sinking forwards.  The lines of his features\nsoftened, and dismay modulated to illimitable sadness.  Bathsheba\nwas regarding him from the other side, still with parted lips and\ndistracted eyes.  Capacity for intense feeling is proportionate to\nthe general intensity of the nature, and perhaps in all Fanny's\nsufferings, much greater relatively to her strength, there never was\na time she suffered in an absolute sense what Bathsheba suffered now.\n\nWhat Troy did was to sink upon his knees with an indefinable union of\nremorse and reverence upon his face, and, bending over Fanny Robin,\ngently kissed her, as one would kiss an infant asleep to avoid\nawakening it.\n\nAt the sight and sound of that, to her, unendurable act, Bathsheba\nsprang towards him.  All the strong feelings which had been scattered\nover her existence since she knew what feeling was, seemed gathered\ntogether into one pulsation now.  The revulsion from her indignant\nmood a little earlier, when she had meditated upon compromised\nhonour, forestalment, eclipse in maternity by another, was violent\nand entire.  All that was forgotten in the simple and still\nstrong attachment of wife to husband.  She had sighed for her\nself-completeness then, and now she cried aloud against the severance\nof the union she had deplored.  She flung her arms round Troy's neck,\nexclaiming wildly from the deepest deep of her heart--\n\n\"Don't--don't kiss them!  O, Frank, I can't bear it--I can't!  I love\nyou better than she did: kiss me too, Frank--kiss me!  YOU WILL,\nFRANK, KISS ME TOO!\"\n\nThere was something so abnormal and startling in the childlike pain\nand simplicity of this appeal from a woman of Bathsheba's calibre\nand independence, that Troy, loosening her tightly clasped arms from\nhis neck, looked at her in bewilderment.  It was such an unexpected\nrevelation of all women being alike at heart, even those so different\nin their accessories as Fanny and this one beside him, that Troy\ncould hardly seem to believe her to be his proud wife Bathsheba.\nFanny's own spirit seemed to be animating her frame.  But this was\nthe mood of a few instants only.  When the momentary surprise had\npassed, his expression changed to a silencing imperious gaze.\n\n\"I will not kiss you!\" he said pushing her away.\n\nHad the wife now but gone no further.  Yet, perhaps, under the\nharrowing circumstances, to speak out was the one wrong act which\ncan be better understood, if not forgiven in her, than the right and\npolitic one, her rival being now but a corpse.  All the feeling she\nhad been betrayed into showing she drew back to herself again by a\nstrenuous effort of self-command.\n\n\"What have you to say as your reason?\" she asked, her bitter voice\nbeing strangely low--quite that of another woman now.\n\n\"I have to say that I have been a bad, black-hearted man,\" he\nanswered.\n\n\"And that this woman is your victim; and I not less than she.\"\n\n\"Ah! don't taunt me, madam.  This woman is more to me, dead as she\nis, than ever you were, or are, or can be.  If Satan had not tempted\nme with that face of yours, and those cursed coquetries, I should\nhave married her.  I never had another thought till you came in my\nway.  Would to God that I had; but it is all too late!\"  He turned\nto Fanny then.  \"But never mind, darling,\" he said; \"in the sight of\nHeaven you are my very, very wife!\"\n\nAt these words there arose from Bathsheba's lips a long, low cry of\nmeasureless despair and indignation, such a wail of anguish as had\nnever before been heard within those old-inhabited walls.  It was the\n\"Tetelestai\" [GREEK word meaning \"it is finished\"] of her union with Troy.\n\n\"If she's--that,--what--am I?\" she added, as a continuation of the\nsame cry, and sobbing pitifully: and the rarity with her of such\nabandonment only made the condition more dire.\n\n\"You are nothing to me--nothing,\" said Troy, heartlessly.  \"A\nceremony before a priest doesn't make a marriage.  I am not morally\nyours.\"\n\nA vehement impulse to flee from him, to run from this place, hide,\nand escape his words at any price, not stopping short of death\nitself, mastered Bathsheba now.  She waited not an instant, but\nturned to the door and ran out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\n\nUNDER A TREE--REACTION\n\n\nBathsheba went along the dark road, neither knowing nor caring about\nthe direction or issue of her flight.  The first time that she\ndefinitely noticed her position was when she reached a gate leading\ninto a thicket overhung by some large oak and beech trees.  On\nlooking into the place, it occurred to her that she had seen it by\ndaylight on some previous occasion, and that what appeared like an\nimpassable thicket was in reality a brake of fern now withering fast.\nShe could think of nothing better to do with her palpitating self\nthan to go in here and hide; and entering, she lighted on a spot\nsheltered from the damp fog by a reclining trunk, where she sank down\nupon a tangled couch of fronds and stems.  She mechanically pulled\nsome armfuls round her to keep off the breezes, and closed her eyes.\n\nWhether she slept or not that night Bathsheba was not clearly aware.\nBut it was with a freshened existence and a cooler brain that, a long\ntime afterwards, she became conscious of some interesting proceedings\nwhich were going on in the trees above her head and around.\n\nA coarse-throated chatter was the first sound.\n\nIt was a sparrow just waking.\n\nNext: \"Chee-weeze-weeze-weeze!\" from another retreat.\n\nIt was a finch.\n\nThird: \"Tink-tink-tink-tink-a-chink!\" from the hedge.\n\nIt was a robin.\n\n\"Chuck-chuck-chuck!\" overhead.\n\nA squirrel.\n\nThen, from the road, \"With my ra-ta-ta, and my rum-tum-tum!\"\n\nIt was a ploughboy.  Presently he came opposite, and she believed\nfrom his voice that he was one of the boys on her own farm.  He was\nfollowed by a shambling tramp of heavy feet, and looking through the\nferns Bathsheba could just discern in the wan light of daybreak a\nteam of her own horses.  They stopped to drink at a pond on the other\nside of the way.  She watched them flouncing into the pool, drinking,\ntossing up their heads, drinking again, the water dribbling from\ntheir lips in silver threads.  There was another flounce, and they\ncame out of the pond, and turned back again towards the farm.\n\nShe looked further around.  Day was just dawning, and beside its cool\nair and colours her heated actions and resolves of the night stood\nout in lurid contrast.  She perceived that in her lap, and clinging\nto her hair, were red and yellow leaves which had come down from\nthe tree and settled silently upon her during her partial sleep.\nBathsheba shook her dress to get rid of them, when multitudes of the\nsame family lying round about her rose and fluttered away in the\nbreeze thus created, \"like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing.\"\n\nThere was an opening towards the east, and the glow from the as yet\nunrisen sun attracted her eyes thither.  From her feet, and between\nthe beautiful yellowing ferns with their feathery arms, the ground\nsloped downwards to a hollow, in which was a species of swamp,\ndotted with fungi.  A morning mist hung over it now--a fulsome\nyet magnificent silvery veil, full of light from the sun, yet\nsemi-opaque--the hedge behind it being in some measure hidden by its\nhazy luminousness.  Up the sides of this depression grew sheaves of\nthe common rush, and here and there a peculiar species of flag, the\nblades of which glistened in the emerging sun, like scythes.  But\nthe general aspect of the swamp was malignant.  From its moist and\npoisonous coat seemed to be exhaled the essences of evil things in\nthe earth, and in the waters under the earth.  The fungi grew in\nall manner of positions from rotting leaves and tree stumps, some\nexhibiting to her listless gaze their clammy tops, others their\noozing gills.  Some were marked with great splotches, red as arterial\nblood, others were saffron yellow, and others tall and attenuated,\nwith stems like macaroni.  Some were leathery and of richest browns.\nThe hollow seemed a nursery of pestilences small and great, in the\nimmediate neighbourhood of comfort and health, and Bathsheba arose\nwith a tremor at the thought of having passed the night on the brink\nof so dismal a place.\n\nThere were now other footsteps to be heard along the road.\nBathsheba's nerves were still unstrung: she crouched down out of\nsight again, and the pedestrian came into view.  He was a schoolboy,\nwith a bag slung over his shoulder containing his dinner, and a\nbook in his hand.  He paused by the gate, and, without looking up,\ncontinued murmuring words in tones quite loud enough to reach her\nears.\n\n\"'O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord':--that I know out o' book.\n'Give us, give us, give us, give us, give us':--that I know.  'Grace\nthat, grace that, grace that, grace that':--that I know.\" Other\nwords followed to the same effect.  The boy was of the dunce class\napparently; the book was a psalter, and this was his way of learning\nthe collect.  In the worst attacks of trouble there appears to be\nalways a superficial film of consciousness which is left disengaged\nand open to the notice of trifles, and Bathsheba was faintly amused\nat the boy's method, till he too passed on.\n\nBy this time stupor had given place to anxiety, and anxiety began to\nmake room for hunger and thirst.  A form now appeared upon the rise\non the other side of the swamp, half-hidden by the mist, and came\ntowards Bathsheba.  The woman--for it was a woman--approached with\nher face askance, as if looking earnestly on all sides of her.\nWhen she got a little further round to the left, and drew nearer,\nBathsheba could see the newcomer's profile against the sunny sky, and\nknew the wavy sweep from forehead to chin, with neither angle nor\ndecisive line anywhere about it, to be the familiar contour of Liddy\nSmallbury.\n\nBathsheba's heart bounded with gratitude in the thought that she was\nnot altogether deserted, and she jumped up.  \"Oh, Liddy!\" she said,\nor attempted to say; but the words had only been framed by her lips;\nthere came no sound.  She had lost her voice by exposure to the\nclogged atmosphere all these hours of night.\n\n\"Oh, ma'am!  I am so glad I have found you,\" said the girl, as soon\nas she saw Bathsheba.\n\n\"You can't come across,\" Bathsheba said in a whisper, which she\nvainly endeavoured to make loud enough to reach Liddy's ears.  Liddy,\nnot knowing this, stepped down upon the swamp, saying, as she did so,\n\"It will bear me up, I think.\"\n\nBathsheba never forgot that transient little picture of Liddy\ncrossing the swamp to her there in the morning light.  Iridescent\nbubbles of dank subterranean breath rose from the sweating sod beside\nthe waiting-maid's feet as she trod, hissing as they burst and\nexpanded away to join the vapoury firmament above.  Liddy did not\nsink, as Bathsheba had anticipated.\n\nShe landed safely on the other side, and looked up at the beautiful\nthough pale and weary face of her young mistress.\n\n\"Poor thing!\" said Liddy, with tears in her eyes, \"Do hearten\nyourself up a little, ma'am.  However did--\"\n\n\"I can't speak above a whisper--my voice is gone for the present,\"\nsaid Bathsheba, hurriedly.  \"I suppose the damp air from that\nhollow has taken it away.  Liddy, don't question me, mind.  Who\nsent you--anybody?\"\n\n\"Nobody.  I thought, when I found you were not at home, that\nsomething cruel had happened.  I fancy I heard his voice late last\nnight; and so, knowing something was wrong--\"\n\n\"Is he at home?\"\n\n\"No; he left just before I came out.\"\n\n\"Is Fanny taken away?\"\n\n\"Not yet.  She will soon be--at nine o'clock.\"\n\n\"We won't go home at present, then.  Suppose we walk about in this\nwood?\"\n\nLiddy, without exactly understanding everything, or anything, in this\nepisode, assented, and they walked together further among the trees.\n\n\"But you had better come in, ma'am, and have something to eat.  You\nwill die of a chill!\"\n\n\"I shall not come indoors yet--perhaps never.\"\n\n\"Shall I get you something to eat, and something else to put over\nyour head besides that little shawl?\"\n\n\"If you will, Liddy.\"\n\nLiddy vanished, and at the end of twenty minutes returned with a\ncloak, hat, some slices of bread and butter, a tea-cup, and some hot\ntea in a little china jug.\n\n\"Is Fanny gone?\" said Bathsheba.\n\n\"No,\" said her companion, pouring out the tea.\n\nBathsheba wrapped herself up and ate and drank sparingly.  Her voice\nwas then a little clearer, and trifling colour returned to her face.\n\"Now we'll walk about again,\" she said.\n\nThey wandered about the wood for nearly two hours, Bathsheba replying\nin monosyllables to Liddy's prattle, for her mind ran on one subject,\nand one only.  She interrupted with--\n\n\"I wonder if Fanny is gone by this time?\"\n\n\"I will go and see.\"\n\nShe came back with the information that the men were just taking\naway the corpse; that Bathsheba had been inquired for; that she had\nreplied to the effect that her mistress was unwell and could not be\nseen.\n\n\"Then they think I am in my bedroom?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"  Liddy then ventured to add: \"You said when I first found you\nthat you might never go home again--you didn't mean it, ma'am?\"\n\n\"No; I've altered my mind.  It is only women with no pride in them\nwho run away from their husbands.  There is one position worse than\nthat of being found dead in your husband's house from his ill usage,\nand that is, to be found alive through having gone away to the house\nof somebody else.  I've thought of it all this morning, and I've\nchosen my course.  A runaway wife is an encumbrance to everybody,\na burden to herself and a byword--all of which make up a heap of\nmisery greater than any that comes by staying at home--though this\nmay include the trifling items of insult, beating, and starvation.\nLiddy, if ever you marry--God forbid that you ever should!--you'll\nfind yourself in a fearful situation; but mind this, don't you\nflinch. Stand your ground, and be cut to pieces.  That's what I'm\ngoing to do.\"\n\n\"Oh, mistress, don't talk so!\" said Liddy, taking her hand; \"but I\nknew you had too much sense to bide away.  May I ask what dreadful\nthing it is that has happened between you and him?\"\n\n\"You may ask; but I may not tell.\"\n\nIn about ten minutes they returned to the house by a circuitous\nroute, entering at the rear.  Bathsheba glided up the back stairs to\na disused attic, and her companion followed.\n\n\"Liddy,\" she said, with a lighter heart, for youth and hope had\nbegun to reassert themselves; \"you are to be my confidante for the\npresent--somebody must be--and I choose you.  Well, I shall take up\nmy abode here for a while.  Will you get a fire lighted, put down\na piece of carpet, and help me to make the place comfortable.\nAfterwards, I want you and Maryann to bring up that little stump\nbedstead in the small room, and the bed belonging to it, and a table,\nand some other things....  What shall I do to pass the heavy time\naway?\"\n\n\"Hemming handkerchiefs is a very good thing,\" said Liddy.\n\n\"Oh no, no!  I hate needlework--I always did.\"\n\n\"Knitting?\"\n\n\"And that, too.\"\n\n\"You might finish your sampler.  Only the carnations and peacocks\nwant filling in; and then it could be framed and glazed, and hung\nbeside your aunt's ma'am.\"\n\n\"Samplers are out of date--horribly countrified.  No Liddy, I'll\nread.  Bring up some books--not new ones.  I haven't heart to read\nanything new.\"\n\n\"Some of your uncle's old ones, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Some of those we stowed away in boxes.\"  A faint gleam\nof humour passed over her face as she said: \"Bring Beaumont and\nFletcher's _Maid's Tragedy_, and the _Mourning Bride_, and--let\nme see--_Night Thoughts_, and the _Vanity of Human Wishes_.\"\n\n\"And that story of the black man, who murdered his wife Desdemona?\nIt is a nice dismal one that would suit you excellent just now.\"\n\n\"Now, Liddy, you've been looking into my books without telling me;\nand I said you were not to!  How do you know it would suit me?  It\nwouldn't suit me at all.\"\n\n\"But if the others do--\"\n\n\"No, they don't; and I won't read dismal books.  Why should\nI read dismal books, indeed?  Bring me _Love in a Village_,\nand _Maid of the Mill_, and _Doctor Syntax_, and some volumes of\nthe _Spectator-_.\"\n\nAll that day Bathsheba and Liddy lived in the attic in a state of\nbarricade; a precaution which proved to be needless as against Troy,\nfor he did not appear in the neighbourhood or trouble them at all.\nBathsheba sat at the window till sunset, sometimes attempting to\nread, at other times watching every movement outside without much\npurpose, and listening without much interest to every sound.\n\nThe sun went down almost blood-red that night, and a livid cloud\nreceived its rays in the east.  Up against this dark background the\nwest front of the church tower--the only part of the edifice visible\nfrom the farm-house windows--rose distinct and lustrous, the vane\nupon the summit bristling with rays.  Hereabouts, at six o'clock, the\nyoung men of the village gathered, as was their custom, for a game\nof Prisoners' base.  The spot had been consecrated to this ancient\ndiversion from time immemorial, the old stocks conveniently forming\na base facing the boundary of the churchyard, in front of which the\nground was trodden hard and bare as a pavement by the players.  She\ncould see the brown and black heads of the young lads darting about\nright and left, their white shirt-sleeves gleaming in the sun;\nwhilst occasionally a shout and a peal of hearty laughter varied the\nstillness of the evening air.  They continued playing for a quarter\nof an hour or so, when the game concluded abruptly, and the players\nleapt over the wall and vanished round to the other side behind a\nyew-tree, which was also half behind a beech, now spreading in one\nmass of golden foliage, on which the branches traced black lines.\n\n\"Why did the base-players finish their game so suddenly?\" Bathsheba\ninquired, the next time that Liddy entered the room.\n\n\"I think 'twas because two men came just then from Casterbridge and\nbegan putting up a grand carved tombstone,\" said Liddy.  \"The lads\nwent to see whose it was.\"\n\n\"Do you know?\" Bathsheba asked.\n\n\"I don't,\" said Liddy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV\n\n\nTROY'S ROMANTICISM\n\n\nWhen Troy's wife had left the house at the previous midnight his\nfirst act was to cover the dead from sight.  This done he ascended\nthe stairs, and throwing himself down upon the bed dressed as he was,\nhe waited miserably for the morning.\n\nFate had dealt grimly with him through the last four-and-twenty\nhours.  His day had been spent in a way which varied very materially\nfrom his intentions regarding it.  There is always an inertia to\nbe overcome in striking out a new line of conduct--not more in\nourselves, it seems, than in circumscribing events, which appear as\nif leagued together to allow no novelties in the way of amelioration.\n\nTwenty pounds having been secured from Bathsheba, he had managed to\nadd to the sum every farthing he could muster on his own account,\nwhich had been seven pounds ten.  With this money, twenty-seven\npounds ten in all, he had hastily driven from the gate that morning\nto keep his appointment with Fanny Robin.\n\nOn reaching Casterbridge he left the horse and trap at an inn, and\nat five minutes before ten came back to the bridge at the lower end\nof the town, and sat himself upon the parapet.  The clocks struck\nthe hour, and no Fanny appeared.  In fact, at that moment she was\nbeing robed in her grave-clothes by two attendants at the Union\npoorhouse--the first and last tiring-women the gentle creature had\never been honoured with.  The quarter went, the half hour.  A rush of\nrecollection came upon Troy as he waited: this was the second time\nshe had broken a serious engagement with him.  In anger he vowed\nit should be the last, and at eleven o'clock, when he had lingered\nand watched the stone of the bridge till he knew every lichen upon\ntheir face and heard the chink of the ripples underneath till they\noppressed him, he jumped from his seat, went to the inn for his\ngig, and in a bitter mood of indifference concerning the past, and\nrecklessness about the future, drove on to Budmouth races.\n\nHe reached the race-course at two o'clock, and remained either there\nor in the town till nine.  But Fanny's image, as it had appeared to\nhim in the sombre shadows of that Saturday evening, returned to his\nmind, backed up by Bathsheba's reproaches.  He vowed he would not\nbet, and he kept his vow, for on leaving the town at nine o'clock in\nthe evening he had diminished his cash only to the extent of a few\nshillings.\n\nHe trotted slowly homeward, and it was now that he was struck for the\nfirst time with a thought that Fanny had been really prevented by\nillness from keeping her promise.  This time she could have made no\nmistake.  He regretted that he had not remained in Casterbridge and\nmade inquiries.  Reaching home he quietly unharnessed the horse and\ncame indoors, as we have seen, to the fearful shock that awaited him.\n\n\nAs soon as it grew light enough to distinguish objects, Troy arose\nfrom the coverlet of the bed, and in a mood of absolute indifference\nto Bathsheba's whereabouts, and almost oblivious of her existence, he\nstalked downstairs and left the house by the back door.  His walk was\ntowards the churchyard, entering which he searched around till he\nfound a newly dug unoccupied grave--the grave dug the day before for\nFanny.  The position of this having been marked, he hastened on to\nCasterbridge, only pausing and musing for a while at the hill whereon\nhe had last seen Fanny alive.\n\nReaching the town, Troy descended into a side street and entered a\npair of gates surmounted by a board bearing the words, \"Lester, stone\nand marble mason.\"  Within were lying about stones of all sizes and\ndesigns, inscribed as being sacred to the memory of unnamed persons\nwho had not yet died.\n\nTroy was so unlike himself now in look, word, and deed, that the\nwant of likeness was perceptible even to his own consciousness.  His\nmethod of engaging himself in this business of purchasing a tomb was\nthat of an absolutely unpractised man.  He could not bring himself\nto consider, calculate, or economize.  He waywardly wished for\nsomething, and he set about obtaining it like a child in a nursery.\n\"I want a good tomb,\" he said to the man who stood in a little office\nwithin the yard.  \"I want as good a one as you can give me for\ntwenty-seven pounds.\"\n\nIt was all the money he possessed.\n\n\"That sum to include everything?\"\n\n\"Everything.  Cutting the name, carriage to Weatherbury, and\nerection.  And I want it now, at once.\"\n\n\"We could not get anything special worked this week.\"\n\n\"I must have it now.\"\n\n\"If you would like one of these in stock it could be got ready\nimmediately.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Troy, impatiently.  \"Let's see what you have.\"\n\n\"The best I have in stock is this one,\" said the stone-cutter, going\ninto a shed.  \"Here's a marble headstone beautifully crocketed, with\nmedallions beneath of typical subjects; here's the footstone after\nthe same pattern, and here's the coping to enclose the grave.  The\npolishing alone of the set cost me eleven pounds--the slabs are the\nbest of their kind, and I can warrant them to resist rain and frost\nfor a hundred years without flying.\"\n\n\"And how much?\"\n\n\"Well, I could add the name, and put it up at Weatherbury for the sum\nyou mention.\"\n\n\"Get it done to-day, and I'll pay the money now.\"\n\nThe man agreed, and wondered at such a mood in a visitor who wore not\na shred of mourning.  Troy then wrote the words which were to form\nthe inscription, settled the account and went away.  In the afternoon\nhe came back again, and found that the lettering was almost done.  He\nwaited in the yard till the tomb was packed, and saw it placed in the\ncart and starting on its way to Weatherbury, giving directions to the\ntwo men who were to accompany it to inquire of the sexton for the\ngrave of the person named in the inscription.\n\nIt was quite dark when Troy came out of Casterbridge.  He carried\nrather a heavy basket upon his arm, with which he strode moodily\nalong the road, resting occasionally at bridges and gates, whereon\nhe deposited his burden for a time.  Midway on his journey he met,\nreturning in the darkness, the men and the waggon which had conveyed\nthe tomb.  He merely inquired if the work was done, and, on being\nassured that it was, passed on again.\n\nTroy entered Weatherbury churchyard about ten o'clock and went\nimmediately to the corner where he had marked the vacant grave early\nin the morning.  It was on the obscure side of the tower, screened to\na great extent from the view of passers along the road--a spot which\nuntil lately had been abandoned to heaps of stones and bushes of\nalder, but now it was cleared and made orderly for interments, by\nreason of the rapid filling of the ground elsewhere.\n\nHere now stood the tomb as the men had stated, snow-white and shapely\nin the gloom, consisting of head and foot-stone, and enclosing border\nof marble-work uniting them.  In the midst was mould, suitable for\nplants.\n\nTroy deposited his basket beside the tomb, and vanished for a few\nminutes.  When he returned he carried a spade and a lantern, the\nlight of which he directed for a few moments upon the marble, whilst\nhe read the inscription.  He hung his lantern on the lowest bough\nof the yew-tree, and took from his basket flower-roots of several\nvarieties.  There were bundles of snow-drop, hyacinth and crocus\nbulbs, violets and double daisies, which were to bloom in early\nspring, and of carnations, pinks, picotees, lilies of the valley,\nforget-me-not, summer's farewell, meadow-saffron and others, for\nthe later seasons of the year.\n\nTroy laid these out upon the grass, and with an impassive face set\nto work to plant them.  The snowdrops were arranged in a line on the\noutside of the coping, the remainder within the enclosure of the\ngrave.  The crocuses and hyacinths were to grow in rows; some of\nthe summer flowers he placed over her head and feet, the lilies and\nforget-me-nots over her heart.  The remainder were dispersed in the\nspaces between these.\n\nTroy, in his prostration at this time, had no perception that in the\nfutility of these romantic doings, dictated by a remorseful reaction\nfrom previous indifference, there was any element of absurdity.\nDeriving his idiosyncrasies from both sides of the Channel, he showed\nat such junctures as the present the inelasticity of the Englishman,\ntogether with that blindness to the line where sentiment verges on\nmawkishness, characteristic of the French.\n\nIt was a cloudy, muggy, and very dark night, and the rays from Troy's\nlantern spread into the two old yews with a strange illuminating\npower, flickering, as it seemed, up to the black ceiling of cloud\nabove.  He felt a large drop of rain upon the back of his hand, and\npresently one came and entered one of the holes of the lantern,\nwhereupon the candle sputtered and went out.  Troy was weary and\nit being now not far from midnight, and the rain threatening to\nincrease, he resolved to leave the finishing touches of his labour\nuntil the day should break.  He groped along the wall and over the\ngraves in the dark till he found himself round at the north side.\nHere he entered the porch, and, reclining upon the bench within,\nfell asleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI\n\n\nTHE GURGOYLE: ITS DOINGS\n\n\nThe tower of Weatherbury Church was a square erection of\nfourteenth-century date, having two stone gurgoyles on each of the\nfour faces of its parapet.  Of these eight carved protuberances\nonly two at this time continued to serve the purpose of their\nerection--that of spouting the water from the lead roof within.  One\nmouth in each front had been closed by bygone church-wardens as\nsuperfluous, and two others were broken away and choked--a matter not\nof much consequence to the wellbeing of the tower, for the two mouths\nwhich still remained open and active were gaping enough to do all the\nwork.\n\nIt has been sometimes argued that there is no truer criterion of the\nvitality of any given art-period than the power of the master-spirits\nof that time in grotesque; and certainly in the instance of Gothic\nart there is no disputing the proposition.  Weatherbury tower was a\nsomewhat early instance of the use of an ornamental parapet in parish\nas distinct from cathedral churches, and the gurgoyles, which are the\nnecessary correlatives of a parapet, were exceptionally prominent--of\nthe boldest cut that the hand could shape, and of the most original\ndesign that a human brain could conceive.  There was, so to speak,\nthat symmetry in their distortion which is less the characteristic\nof British than of Continental grotesques of the period.  All the\neight were different from each other.  A beholder was convinced that\nnothing on earth could be more hideous than those he saw on the north\nside until he went round to the south.  Of the two on this latter\nface, only that at the south-eastern corner concerns the story.  It\nwas too human to be called like a dragon, too impish to be like a\nman, too animal to be like a fiend, and not enough like a bird to be\ncalled a griffin.  This horrible stone entity was fashioned as if\ncovered with a wrinkled hide; it had short, erect ears, eyes starting\nfrom their sockets, and its fingers and hands were seizing the\ncorners of its mouth, which they thus seemed to pull open to give\nfree passage to the water it vomited.  The lower row of teeth was\nquite washed away, though the upper still remained.  Here and thus,\njutting a couple of feet from the wall against which its feet rested\nas a support, the creature had for four hundred years laughed at the\nsurrounding landscape, voicelessly in dry weather, and in wet with a\ngurgling and snorting sound.\n\nTroy slept on in the porch, and the rain increased outside. Presently\nthe gurgoyle spat.  In due time a small stream began to trickle\nthrough the seventy feet of aerial space between its mouth and\nthe ground, which the water-drops smote like duckshot in their\naccelerated velocity.  The stream thickened in substance, and\nincreased in power, gradually spouting further and yet further from\nthe side of the tower.  When the rain fell in a steady and ceaseless\ntorrent the stream dashed downward in volumes.\n\nWe follow its course to the ground at this point of time. The end of\nthe liquid parabola has come forward from the wall, has advanced over\nthe plinth mouldings, over a heap of stones, over the marble border,\ninto the midst of Fanny Robin's grave.\n\nThe force of the stream had, until very lately, been received upon\nsome loose stones spread thereabout, which had acted as a shield to\nthe soil under the onset.  These during the summer had been cleared\nfrom the ground, and there was now nothing to resist the down-fall\nbut the bare earth.  For several years the stream had not spouted\nso far from the tower as it was doing on this night, and such a\ncontingency had been over-looked.  Sometimes this obscure corner\nreceived no inhabitant for the space of two or three years, and\nthen it was usually but a pauper, a poacher, or other sinner of\nundignified sins.\n\nThe persistent torrent from the gurgoyle's jaws directed all its\nvengeance into the grave.  The rich tawny mould was stirred into\nmotion, and boiled like chocolate.  The water accumulated and washed\ndeeper down, and the roar of the pool thus formed spread into the\nnight as the head and chief among other noises of the kind created\nby the deluging rain.  The flowers so carefully planted by Fanny's\nrepentant lover began to move and writhe in their bed.  The\nwinter-violets turned slowly upside down, and became a mere mat of\nmud.  Soon the snowdrop and other bulbs danced in the boiling mass\nlike ingredients in a cauldron.  Plants of the tufted species were\nloosened, rose to the surface, and floated off.\n\nTroy did not awake from his comfortless sleep till it was broad day.\nNot having been in bed for two nights his shoulders felt stiff, his\nfeet tender, and his head heavy.  He remembered his position, arose,\nshivered, took the spade, and again went out.\n\nThe rain had quite ceased, and the sun was shining through the\ngreen, brown, and yellow leaves, now sparkling and varnished by the\nraindrops to the brightness of similar effects in the landscapes of\nRuysdael and Hobbema, and full of all those infinite beauties that\narise from the union of water and colour with high lights.  The air\nwas rendered so transparent by the heavy fall of rain that the autumn\nhues of the middle distance were as rich as those near at hand, and\nthe remote fields intercepted by the angle of the tower appeared in\nthe same plane as the tower itself.\n\nHe entered the gravel path which would take him behind the tower.\nThe path, instead of being stony as it had been the night before, was\nbrowned over with a thin coating of mud.  At one place in the path\nhe saw a tuft of stringy roots washed white and clean as a bundle\nof tendons.  He picked it up--surely it could not be one of the\nprimroses he had planted?  He saw a bulb, another, and another as\nhe advanced.  Beyond doubt they were the crocuses.  With a face of\nperplexed dismay Troy turned the corner and then beheld the wreck\nthe stream had made.\n\nThe pool upon the grave had soaked away into the ground, and in its\nplace was a hollow.  The disturbed earth was washed over the grass\nand pathway in the guise of the brown mud he had already seen, and it\nspotted the marble tombstone with the same stains.  Nearly all the\nflowers were washed clean out of the ground, and they lay, roots\nupwards, on the spots whither they had been splashed by the stream.\n\nTroy's brow became heavily contracted.  He set his teeth closely,\nand his compressed lips moved as those of one in great pain.  This\nsingular accident, by a strange confluence of emotions in him, was\nfelt as the sharpest sting of all.  Troy's face was very expressive,\nand any observer who had seen him now would hardly have believed him\nto be a man who had laughed, and sung, and poured love-trifles into\na woman's ear.  To curse his miserable lot was at first his impulse,\nbut even that lowest stage of rebellion needed an activity whose\nabsence was necessarily antecedent to the existence of the morbid\nmisery which wrung him.  The sight, coming as it did, superimposed\nupon the other dark scenery of the previous days, formed a sort of\nclimax to the whole panorama, and it was more than he could endure.\nSanguine by nature, Troy had a power of eluding grief by simply\nadjourning it.  He could put off the consideration of any particular\nspectre till the matter had become old and softened by time.  The\nplanting of flowers on Fanny's grave had been perhaps but a species\nof elusion of the primary grief, and now it was as if his intention\nhad been known and circumvented.\n\nAlmost for the first time in his life, Troy, as he stood by this\ndismantled grave, wished himself another man.  It is seldom that a\nperson with much animal spirit does not feel that the fact of his\nlife being his own is the one qualification which singles it out as a\nmore hopeful life than that of others who may actually resemble him\nin every particular.  Troy had felt, in his transient way, hundreds\nof times, that he could not envy other people their condition,\nbecause the possession of that condition would have necessitated a\ndifferent personality, when he desired no other than his own.  He had\nnot minded the peculiarities of his birth, the vicissitudes of his\nlife, the meteor-like uncertainty of all that related to him, because\nthese appertained to the hero of his story, without whom there would\nhave been no story at all for him; and it seemed to be only in the\nnature of things that matters would right themselves at some proper\ndate and wind up well.  This very morning the illusion completed its\ndisappearance, and, as it were, all of a sudden, Troy hated himself.\nThe suddenness was probably more apparent than real.  A coral reef\nwhich just comes short of the ocean surface is no more to the horizon\nthan if it had never been begun, and the mere finishing stroke is\nwhat often appears to create an event which has long been potentially\nan accomplished thing.\n\nHe stood and meditated--a miserable man.  Whither should he\ngo?  \"He that is accursed, let him be accursed still,\" was the\npitiless anathema written in this spoliated effort of his new-born\nsolicitousness.  A man who has spent his primal strength in\njourneying in one direction has not much spirit left for reversing\nhis course.  Troy had, since yesterday, faintly reversed his; but the\nmerest opposition had disheartened him.  To turn about would have\nbeen hard enough under the greatest providential encouragement; but\nto find that Providence, far from helping him into a new course, or\nshowing any wish that he might adopt one, actually jeered his first\ntrembling and critical attempt in that kind, was more than nature\ncould bear.\n\nHe slowly withdrew from the grave.  He did not attempt to fill up the\nhole, replace the flowers, or do anything at all.  He simply threw up\nhis cards and forswore his game for that time and always.  Going out\nof the churchyard silently and unobserved--none of the villagers\nhaving yet risen--he passed down some fields at the back, and emerged\njust as secretly upon the high road.  Shortly afterwards he had gone\nfrom the village.\n\nMeanwhile, Bathsheba remained a voluntary prisoner in the attic.  The\ndoor was kept locked, except during the entries and exits of Liddy,\nfor whom a bed had been arranged in a small adjoining room.  The\nlight of Troy's lantern in the churchyard was noticed about ten\no'clock by the maid-servant, who casually glanced from the window in\nthat direction whilst taking her supper, and she called Bathsheba's\nattention to it.  They looked curiously at the phenomenon for a time,\nuntil Liddy was sent to bed.\n\nBathsheba did not sleep very heavily that night.  When her attendant\nwas unconscious and softly breathing in the next room, the mistress\nof the house was still looking out of the window at the faint gleam\nspreading from among the trees--not in a steady shine, but blinking\nlike a revolving coast-light, though this appearance failed to\nsuggest to her that a person was passing and repassing in front\nof it.  Bathsheba sat here till it began to rain, and the light\nvanished, when she withdrew to lie restlessly in her bed and re-enact\nin a worn mind the lurid scene of yesternight.\n\nAlmost before the first faint sign of dawn appeared she arose again,\nand opened the window to obtain a full breathing of the new morning\nair, the panes being now wet with trembling tears left by the night\nrain, each one rounded with a pale lustre caught from primrose-hued\nslashes through a cloud low down in the awakening sky.  From the\ntrees came the sound of steady dripping upon the drifted leaves under\nthem, and from the direction of the church she could hear another\nnoise--peculiar, and not intermittent like the rest, the purl of\nwater falling into a pool.\n\nLiddy knocked at eight o'clock, and Bathsheba un-locked the door.\n\n\"What a heavy rain we've had in the night, ma'am!\" said Liddy, when\nher inquiries about breakfast had been made.\n\n\"Yes, very heavy.\"\n\n\"Did you hear the strange noise from the churchyard?\"\n\n\"I heard one strange noise.  I've been thinking it must have been the\nwater from the tower spouts.\"\n\n\"Well, that's what the shepherd was saying, ma'am.  He's now gone on\nto see.\"\n\n\"Oh!  Gabriel has been here this morning!\"\n\n\"Only just looked in in passing--quite in his old way, which I\nthought he had left off lately.  But the tower spouts used to spatter\non the stones, and we are puzzled, for this was like the boiling of a\npot.\"\n\nNot being able to read, think, or work, Bathsheba asked Liddy to stay\nand breakfast with her.  The tongue of the more childish woman still\nran upon recent events.  \"Are you going across to the church, ma'am?\"\nshe asked.\n\n\"Not that I know of,\" said Bathsheba.\n\n\"I thought you might like to go and see where they have put Fanny.\nThe trees hide the place from your window.\"\n\nBathsheba had all sorts of dreads about meeting her husband.  \"Has\nMr. Troy been in to-night?\" she said.\n\n\"No, ma'am; I think he's gone to Budmouth.\"\n\nBudmouth!  The sound of the word carried with it a much diminished\nperspective of him and his deeds; there were thirteen miles interval\nbetwixt them now.  She hated questioning Liddy about her husband's\nmovements, and indeed had hitherto sedulously avoided doing so; but\nnow all the house knew that there had been some dreadful disagreement\nbetween them, and it was futile to attempt disguise.  Bathsheba had\nreached a stage at which people cease to have any appreciative regard\nfor public opinion.\n\n\"What makes you think he has gone there?\" she said.\n\n\"Laban Tall saw him on the Budmouth road this morning before\nbreakfast.\"\n\nBathsheba was momentarily relieved of that wayward heaviness of the\npast twenty-four hours which had quenched the vitality of youth in\nher without substituting the philosophy of maturer years, and she\nresolved to go out and walk a little way.  So when breakfast was\nover, she put on her bonnet, and took a direction towards the church.\nIt was nine o'clock, and the men having returned to work again from\ntheir first meal, she was not likely to meet many of them in the\nroad.  Knowing that Fanny had been laid in the reprobates' quarter\nof the graveyard, called in the parish \"behind church,\" which was\ninvisible from the road, it was impossible to resist the impulse to\nenter and look upon a spot which, from nameless feelings, she at\nthe same time dreaded to see.  She had been unable to overcome an\nimpression that some connection existed between her rival and the\nlight through the trees.\n\nBathsheba skirted the buttress, and beheld the hole and the tomb, its\ndelicately veined surface splashed and stained just as Troy had seen\nit and left it two hours earlier.  On the other side of the scene\nstood Gabriel.  His eyes, too, were fixed on the tomb, and her\narrival having been noiseless, she had not as yet attracted his\nattention.  Bathsheba did not at once perceive that the grand tomb\nand the disturbed grave were Fanny's, and she looked on both sides\nand around for some humbler mound, earthed up and clodded in the\nusual way.  Then her eye followed Oak's, and she read the words with\nwhich the inscription opened:--\n\n\n     ERECTED BY FRANCIS TROY\n      IN BELOVED MEMORY OF\n           FANNY ROBIN\n\n\nOak saw her, and his first act was to gaze inquiringly and learn how\nshe received this knowledge of the authorship of the work, which to\nhimself had caused considerable astonishment.  But such discoveries\ndid not much affect her now.  Emotional convulsions seemed to have\nbecome the commonplaces of her history, and she bade him good\nmorning, and asked him to fill in the hole with the spade which\nwas standing by.  Whilst Oak was doing as she desired, Bathsheba\ncollected the flowers, and began planting them with that sympathetic\nmanipulation of roots and leaves which is so conspicuous in a woman's\ngardening, and which flowers seem to understand and thrive upon.  She\nrequested Oak to get the churchwardens to turn the leadwork at the\nmouth of the gurgoyle that hung gaping down upon them, that by this\nmeans the stream might be directed sideways, and a repetition of the\naccident prevented.  Finally, with the superfluous magnanimity of\na woman whose narrower instincts have brought down bitterness upon\nher instead of love, she wiped the mud spots from the tomb as if she\nrather liked its words than otherwise, and went again home. [2]\n\n   [Footnote 2: The local tower and churchyard do not answer\n   precisely to the foregoing description.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII\n\n\nADVENTURES BY THE SHORE\n\n\nTroy wandered along towards the south.  A composite feeling, made up\nof disgust with the, to him, humdrum tediousness of a farmer's life,\ngloomy images of her who lay in the churchyard, remorse, and a\ngeneral averseness to his wife's society, impelled him to seek a\nhome in any place on earth save Weatherbury.  The sad accessories of\nFanny's end confronted him as vivid pictures which threatened to be\nindelible, and made life in Bathsheba's house intolerable.  At three\nin the afternoon he found himself at the foot of a slope more than\na mile in length, which ran to the ridge of a range of hills lying\nparallel with the shore, and forming a monotonous barrier between\nthe basin of cultivated country inland and the wilder scenery of the\ncoast.  Up the hill stretched a road nearly straight and perfectly\nwhite, the two sides approaching each other in a gradual taper till\nthey met the sky at the top about two miles off.  Throughout the\nlength of this narrow and irksome inclined plane not a sign of life\nwas visible on this garish afternoon.  Troy toiled up the road with a\nlanguor and depression greater than any he had experienced for many a\nday and year before.  The air was warm and muggy, and the top seemed\nto recede as he approached.\n\nAt last he reached the summit, and a wide and novel prospect burst\nupon him with an effect almost like that of the Pacific upon Balboa's\ngaze.  The broad steely sea, marked only by faint lines, which had\na semblance of being etched thereon to a degree not deep enough to\ndisturb its general evenness, stretched the whole width of his front\nand round to the right, where, near the town and port of Budmouth,\nthe sun bristled down upon it, and banished all colour, to substitute\nin its place a clear oily polish.  Nothing moved in sky, land, or\nsea, except a frill of milkwhite foam along the nearer angles of the\nshore, shreds of which licked the contiguous stones like tongues.\n\nHe descended and came to a small basin of sea enclosed by the cliffs.\nTroy's nature freshened within him; he thought he would rest and\nbathe here before going farther.  He undressed and plunged in.\nInside the cove the water was uninteresting to a swimmer, being\nsmooth as a pond, and to get a little of the ocean swell, Troy\npresently swam between the two projecting spurs of rock which\nformed the pillars of Hercules to this miniature Mediterranean.\nUnfortunately for Troy a current unknown to him existed outside,\nwhich, unimportant to craft of any burden, was awkward for a swimmer\nwho might be taken in it unawares.  Troy found himself carried to\nthe left and then round in a swoop out to sea.\n\nHe now recollected the place and its sinister character.  Many\nbathers had there prayed for a dry death from time to time, and, like\nGonzalo also, had been unanswered; and Troy began to deem it possible\nthat he might be added to their number.  Not a boat of any kind was\nat present within sight, but far in the distance Budmouth lay upon\nthe sea, as it were quietly regarding his efforts, and beside the\ntown the harbour showed its position by a dim meshwork of ropes and\nspars.  After well-nigh exhausting himself in attempts to get back to\nthe mouth of the cove, in his weakness swimming several inches deeper\nthan was his wont, keeping up his breathing entirely by his nostrils,\nturning upon his back a dozen times over, swimming _en papillon_, and\nso on, Troy resolved as a last resource to tread water at a slight\nincline, and so endeavour to reach the shore at any point, merely\ngiving himself a gentle impetus inwards whilst carried on in the\ngeneral direction of the tide.  This, necessarily a slow process,\nhe found to be not altogether so difficult, and though there was no\nchoice of a landing-place--the objects on shore passing by him in a\nsad and slow procession--he perceptibly approached the extremity of a\nspit of land yet further to the right, now well defined against the\nsunny portion of the horizon.  While the swimmer's eyes were fixed\nupon the spit as his only means of salvation on this side of the\nUnknown, a moving object broke the outline of the extremity, and\nimmediately a ship's boat appeared manned with several sailor lads,\nher bows towards the sea.\n\nAll Troy's vigour spasmodically revived to prolong the struggle yet a\nlittle further.  Swimming with his right arm, he held up his left to\nhail them, splashing upon the waves, and shouting with all his might.\nFrom the position of the setting sun his white form was distinctly\nvisible upon the now deep-hued bosom of the sea to the east of the\nboat, and the men saw him at once.  Backing their oars and putting\nthe boat about, they pulled towards him with a will, and in five or\nsix minutes from the time of his first halloo, two of the sailors\nhauled him in over the stern.\n\nThey formed part of a brig's crew, and had come ashore for sand.\nLending him what little clothing they could spare among them as a\nslight protection against the rapidly cooling air, they agreed to\nland him in the morning; and without further delay, for it was\ngrowing late, they made again towards the roadstead where their\nvessel lay.\n\nAnd now night drooped slowly upon the wide watery levels in front;\nand at no great distance from them, where the shoreline curved round,\nand formed a long riband of shade upon the horizon, a series of\npoints of yellow light began to start into existence, denoting the\nspot to be the site of Budmouth, where the lamps were being lighted\nalong the parade.  The cluck of their oars was the only sound of any\ndistinctness upon the sea, and as they laboured amid the thickening\nshades the lamp-lights grew larger, each appearing to send a flaming\nsword deep down into the waves before it, until there arose, among\nother dim shapes of the kind, the form of the vessel for which they\nwere bound.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII\n\n\nDOUBTS ARISE--DOUBTS LINGER\n\n\nBathsheba underwent the enlargement of her husband's absence from\nhours to days with a slight feeling of surprise, and a slight feeling\nof relief; yet neither sensation rose at any time far above the\nlevel commonly designated as indifference.  She belonged to him: the\ncertainties of that position were so well defined, and the reasonable\nprobabilities of its issue so bounded that she could not speculate on\ncontingencies.  Taking no further interest in herself as a splendid\nwoman, she acquired the indifferent feelings of an outsider in\ncontemplating her probable fate as a singular wretch; for Bathsheba\ndrew herself and her future in colours that no reality could exceed\nfor darkness.  Her original vigorous pride of youth had sickened,\nand with it had declined all her anxieties about coming years, since\nanxiety recognizes a better and a worse alternative, and Bathsheba\nhad made up her mind that alternatives on any noteworthy scale had\nceased for her.  Soon, or later--and that not very late--her husband\nwould be home again.  And then the days of their tenancy of the Upper\nFarm would be numbered.  There had originally been shown by the agent\nto the estate some distrust of Bathsheba's tenure as James Everdene's\nsuccessor, on the score of her sex, and her youth, and her beauty;\nbut the peculiar nature of her uncle's will, his own frequent\ntestimony before his death to her cleverness in such a pursuit, and\nher vigorous marshalling of the numerous flocks and herds which came\nsuddenly into her hands before negotiations were concluded, had won\nconfidence in her powers, and no further objections had been raised.\nShe had latterly been in great doubt as to what the legal effects of\nher marriage would be upon her position; but no notice had been taken\nas yet of her change of name, and only one point was clear--that in\nthe event of her own or her husband's inability to meet the agent at\nthe forthcoming January rent-day, very little consideration would be\nshown, and, for that matter, very little would be deserved.  Once out\nof the farm, the approach of poverty would be sure.\n\nHence Bathsheba lived in a perception that her purposes were broken\noff.  She was not a woman who could hope on without good materials\nfor the process, differing thus from the less far-sighted and\nenergetic, though more petted ones of the sex, with whom hope goes\non as a sort of clockwork which the merest food and shelter are\nsufficient to wind up; and perceiving clearly that her mistake had\nbeen a fatal one, she accepted her position, and waited coldly for\nthe end.\n\nThe first Saturday after Troy's departure she went to Casterbridge\nalone, a journey she had not before taken since her marriage.  On\nthis Saturday Bathsheba was passing slowly on foot through the crowd\nof rural business-men gathered as usual in front of the market-house,\nwho were as usual gazed upon by the burghers with feelings that\nthose healthy lives were dearly paid for by exclusion from possible\naldermanship, when a man, who had apparently been following her,\nsaid some words to another on her left hand.  Bathsheba's ears were\nkeen as those of any wild animal, and she distinctly heard what the\nspeaker said, though her back was towards him.\n\n\"I am looking for Mrs. Troy.  Is that she there?\"\n\n\"Yes; that's the young lady, I believe,\" said the the person\naddressed.\n\n\"I have some awkward news to break to her.  Her husband is drowned.\"\n\nAs if endowed with the spirit of prophecy, Bathsheba gasped out, \"No,\nit is not true; it cannot be true!\"  Then she said and heard no more.\nThe ice of self-command which had latterly gathered over her was\nbroken, and the currents burst forth again, and overwhelmed her.  A\ndarkness came into her eyes, and she fell.\n\nBut not to the ground.  A gloomy man, who had been observing her from\nunder the portico of the old corn-exchange when she passed through\nthe group without, stepped quickly to her side at the moment of her\nexclamation, and caught her in his arms as she sank down.\n\n\"What is it?\" said Boldwood, looking up at the bringer of the big\nnews, as he supported her.\n\n\"Her husband was drowned this week while bathing in Lulwind Cove.\nA coastguardsman found his clothes, and brought them into Budmouth\nyesterday.\"\n\nThereupon a strange fire lighted up Boldwood's eye, and his face\nflushed with the suppressed excitement of an unutterable thought.\nEverybody's glance was now centred upon him and the unconscious\nBathsheba.  He lifted her bodily off the ground, and smoothed down\nthe folds of her dress as a child might have taken a storm-beaten\nbird and arranged its ruffled plumes, and bore her along the\npavement to the King's Arms Inn.  Here he passed with her under the\narchway into a private room; and by the time he had deposited--so\nlothly--the precious burden upon a sofa, Bathsheba had opened her\neyes.  Remembering all that had occurred, she murmured, \"I want to go\nhome!\"\n\nBoldwood left the room.  He stood for a moment in the passage to\nrecover his senses.  The experience had been too much for his\nconsciousness to keep up with, and now that he had grasped it it had\ngone again.  For those few heavenly, golden moments she had been in\nhis arms.  What did it matter about her not knowing it?  She had been\nclose to his breast; he had been close to hers.\n\nHe started onward again, and sending a woman to her, went out to\nascertain all the facts of the case.  These appeared to be limited to\nwhat he had already heard.  He then ordered her horse to be put into\nthe gig, and when all was ready returned to inform her.  He found\nthat, though still pale and unwell, she had in the meantime sent for\nthe Budmouth man who brought the tidings, and learnt from him all\nthere was to know.\n\nBeing hardly in a condition to drive home as she had driven to town,\nBoldwood, with every delicacy of manner and feeling, offered to get\nher a driver, or to give her a seat in his phaeton, which was more\ncomfortable than her own conveyance.  These proposals Bathsheba\ngently declined, and the farmer at once departed.\n\nAbout half-an-hour later she invigorated herself by an effort, and\ntook her seat and the reins as usual--in external appearance much\nas if nothing had happened.  She went out of the town by a tortuous\nback street, and drove slowly along, unconscious of the road and the\nscene.  The first shades of evening were showing themselves when\nBathsheba reached home, where, silently alighting and leaving the\nhorse in the hands of the boy, she proceeded at once upstairs.\nLiddy met her on the landing.  The news had preceded Bathsheba to\nWeatherbury by half-an-hour, and Liddy looked inquiringly into her\nmistress's face.  Bathsheba had nothing to say.\n\nShe entered her bedroom and sat by the window, and thought and\nthought till night enveloped her, and the extreme lines only of her\nshape were visible.  Somebody came to the door, knocked, and opened\nit.\n\n\"Well, what is it, Liddy?\" she said.\n\n\"I was thinking there must be something got for you to wear,\" said\nLiddy, with hesitation.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Mourning.\"\n\n\"No, no, no,\" said Bathsheba, hurriedly.\n\n\"But I suppose there must be something done for poor--\"\n\n\"Not at present, I think.  It is not necessary.\"\n\n\"Why not, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Because he's still alive.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\" said Liddy, amazed.\n\n\"I don't know it.  But wouldn't it have been different, or shouldn't\nI have heard more, or wouldn't they have found him, Liddy?--or--I\ndon't know how it is, but death would have been different from how\nthis is.  I am perfectly convinced that he is still alive!\"\n\n\nBathsheba remained firm in this opinion till Monday, when two\ncircumstances conjoined to shake it.  The first was a short paragraph\nin the local newspaper, which, beyond making by a methodizing\npen formidable presumptive evidence of Troy's death by drowning,\ncontained the important testimony of a young Mr. Barker, M.D., of\nBudmouth, who spoke to being an eyewitness of the accident, in a\nletter to the editor.  In this he stated that he was passing over the\ncliff on the remoter side of the cove just as the sun was setting.\nAt that time he saw a bather carried along in the current outside the\nmouth of the cove, and guessed in an instant that there was but a\npoor chance for him unless he should be possessed of unusual muscular\npowers.  He drifted behind a projection of the coast, and Mr. Barker\nfollowed along the shore in the same direction.  But by the time that\nhe could reach an elevation sufficiently great to command a view of\nthe sea beyond, dusk had set in, and nothing further was to be seen.\n\nThe other circumstance was the arrival of his clothes, when it became\nnecessary for her to examine and identify them--though this had\nvirtually been done long before by those who inspected the letters in\nhis pockets.  It was so evident to her in the midst of her agitation\nthat Troy had undressed in the full conviction of dressing again\nalmost immediately, that the notion that anything but death could\nhave prevented him was a perverse one to entertain.\n\nThen Bathsheba said to herself that others were assured in their\nopinion; strange that she should not be.  A strange reflection\noccurred to her, causing her face to flush.  Suppose that Troy had\nfollowed Fanny into another world. Had he done this intentionally,\nyet contrived to make his death appear like an accident?\nNevertheless, this thought of how the apparent might differ from the\nreal--made vivid by her bygone jealousy of Fanny, and the remorse\nhe had shown that night--did not blind her to the perception of a\nlikelier difference, less tragic, but to herself far more disastrous.\n\nWhen alone late that evening beside a small fire, and much calmed\ndown, Bathsheba took Troy's watch into her hand, which had been\nrestored to her with the rest of the articles belonging to him.  She\nopened the case as he had opened it before her a week ago.  There was\nthe little coil of pale hair which had been as the fuze to this great\nexplosion.\n\n\"He was hers and she was his; they should be gone together,\" she\nsaid.  \"I am nothing to either of them, and why should I keep\nher hair?\"  She took it in her hand, and held it over the fire.\n\"No--I'll not burn it--I'll keep it in memory of her, poor thing!\"\nshe added, snatching back her hand.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX\n\n\nOAK'S ADVANCEMENT--A GREAT HOPE\n\n\nThe later autumn and the winter drew on apace, and the leaves lay\nthick upon the turf of the glades and the mosses of the woods.\nBathsheba, having previously been living in a state of suspended\nfeeling which was not suspense, now lived in a mood of quietude which\nwas not precisely peacefulness.  While she had known him to be alive\nshe could have thought of his death with equanimity; but now that it\nmight be she had lost him, she regretted that he was not hers still.\nShe kept the farm going, raked in her profits without caring keenly\nabout them, and expended money on ventures because she had done so\nin bygone days, which, though not long gone by, seemed infinitely\nremoved from her present.  She looked back upon that past over a\ngreat gulf, as if she were now a dead person, having the faculty of\nmeditation still left in her, by means of which, like the mouldering\ngentlefolk of the poet's story, she could sit and ponder what a gift\nlife used to be.\n\nHowever, one excellent result of her general apathy was the\nlong-delayed installation of Oak as bailiff; but he having virtually\nexercised that function for a long time already, the change, beyond\nthe substantial increase of wages it brought, was little more than a\nnominal one addressed to the outside world.\n\nBoldwood lived secluded and inactive.  Much of his wheat and all his\nbarley of that season had been spoilt by the rain.  It sprouted,\ngrew into intricate mats, and was ultimately thrown to the pigs in\narmfuls.  The strange neglect which had produced this ruin and waste\nbecame the subject of whispered talk among all the people round; and\nit was elicited from one of Boldwood's men that forgetfulness had\nnothing to do with it, for he had been reminded of the danger to his\ncorn as many times and as persistently as inferiors dared to do.\nThe sight of the pigs turning in disgust from the rotten ears seemed\nto arouse Boldwood, and he one evening sent for Oak.  Whether it\nwas suggested by Bathsheba's recent act of promotion or not, the\nfarmer proposed at the interview that Gabriel should undertake the\nsuperintendence of the Lower Farm as well as of Bathsheba's, because\nof the necessity Boldwood felt for such aid, and the impossibility\nof discovering a more trustworthy man. Gabriel's malignant star was\nassuredly setting fast.\n\nBathsheba, when she learnt of this proposal--for Oak was obliged to\nconsult her--at first languidly objected.  She considered that the\ntwo farms together were too extensive for the observation of one\nman.  Boldwood, who was apparently determined by personal rather than\ncommercial reasons, suggested that Oak should be furnished with a\nhorse for his sole use, when the plan would present no difficulty,\nthe two farms lying side by side.  Boldwood did not directly\ncommunicate with her during these negotiations, only speaking to Oak,\nwho was the go-between throughout.  All was harmoniously arranged at\nlast, and we now see Oak mounted on a strong cob, and daily trotting\nthe length and breadth of about two thousand acres in a cheerful spirit\nof surveillance, as if the crops all belonged to him--the actual\nmistress of the one-half and the master of the other, sitting in\ntheir respective homes in gloomy and sad seclusion.\n\nOut of this there arose, during the spring succeeding, a talk in the\nparish that Gabriel Oak was feathering his nest fast.\n\n\"Whatever d'ye think,\" said Susan Tall, \"Gable Oak is coming it quite\nthe dand.  He now wears shining boots with hardly a hob in 'em, two\nor three times a-week, and a tall hat a-Sundays, and 'a hardly knows\nthe name of smockfrock.  When I see people strut enough to be cut up\ninto bantam cocks, I stand dormant with wonder, and says no more!\"\n\nIt was eventually known that Gabriel, though paid a fixed wage by\nBathsheba independent of the fluctuations of agricultural profits,\nhad made an engagement with Boldwood by which Oak was to receive a\nshare of the receipts--a small share certainly, yet it was money of\na higher quality than mere wages, and capable of expansion in a way\nthat wages were not.  Some were beginning to consider Oak a \"near\"\nman, for though his condition had thus far improved, he lived in no\nbetter style than before, occupying the same cottage, paring his own\npotatoes, mending his stockings, and sometimes even making his bed\nwith his own hands.  But as Oak was not only provokingly indifferent\nto public opinion, but a man who clung persistently to old habits and\nusages, simply because they were old, there was room for doubt as to\nhis motives.\n\nA great hope had latterly germinated in Boldwood, whose unreasoning\ndevotion to Bathsheba could only be characterized as a fond madness\nwhich neither time nor circumstance, evil nor good report, could\nweaken or destroy.  This fevered hope had grown up again like a grain\nof mustard-seed during the quiet which followed the hasty conjecture\nthat Troy was drowned.  He nourished it fearfully, and almost shunned\nthe contemplation of it in earnest, lest facts should reveal the\nwildness of the dream.  Bathsheba having at last been persuaded to\nwear mourning, her appearance as she entered the church in that\nguise was in itself a weekly addition to his faith that a time was\ncoming--very far off perhaps, yet surely nearing--when his waiting on\nevents should have its reward.  How long he might have to wait he had\nnot yet closely considered.  What he would try to recognize was that\nthe severe schooling she had been subjected to had made Bathsheba\nmuch more considerate than she had formerly been of the feelings of\nothers, and he trusted that, should she be willing at any time in the\nfuture to marry any man at all, that man would be himself.  There was\na substratum of good feeling in her: her self-reproach for the injury\nshe had thoughtlessly done him might be depended upon now to a much\ngreater extent than before her infatuation and disappointment.  It\nwould be possible to approach her by the channel of her good nature,\nand to suggest a friendly businesslike compact between them for\nfulfilment at some future day, keeping the passionate side of his\ndesire entirely out of her sight.  Such was Boldwood's hope.\n\nTo the eyes of the middle-aged, Bathsheba was perhaps additionally\ncharming just now.  Her exuberance of spirit was pruned down; the\noriginal phantom of delight had shown herself to be not too bright\nfor human nature's daily food, and she had been able to enter this\nsecond poetical phase without losing much of the first in the\nprocess.\n\nBathsheba's return from a two months' visit to her old aunt at\nNorcombe afforded the impassioned and yearning farmer a pretext for\ninquiring directly after her--now possibly in the ninth month of her\nwidowhood--and endeavouring to get a notion of her state of mind\nregarding him.  This occurred in the middle of the haymaking, and\nBoldwood contrived to be near Liddy, who was assisting in the fields.\n\n\"I am glad to see you out of doors, Lydia,\" he said pleasantly.\n\nShe simpered, and wondered in her heart why he should speak so\nfrankly to her.\n\n\"I hope Mrs. Troy is quite well after her long absence,\" he\ncontinued, in a manner expressing that the coldest-hearted neighbour\ncould scarcely say less about her.\n\n\"She is quite well, sir.\"\n\n\"And cheerful, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Yes, cheerful.\"\n\n\"Fearful, did you say?\"\n\n\"Oh no.  I merely said she was cheerful.\"\n\n\"Tells you all her affairs?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Some of them?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Troy puts much confidence in you, Lydia, and very wisely,\nperhaps.\"\n\n\"She do, sir.  I've been with her all through her troubles, and was\nwith her at the time of Mr. Troy's going and all.  And if she were\nto marry again I expect I should bide with her.\"\n\n\"She promises that you shall--quite natural,\" said the strategic\nlover, throbbing throughout him at the presumption which Liddy's\nwords appeared to warrant--that his darling had thought of\nre-marriage.\n\n\"No--she doesn't promise it exactly.  I merely judge on my own\naccount.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I understand.  When she alludes to the possibility of\nmarrying again, you conclude--\"\n\n\"She never do allude to it, sir,\" said Liddy, thinking how very\nstupid Mr. Boldwood was getting.\n\n\"Of course not,\" he returned hastily, his hope falling again.  \"You\nneedn't take quite such long reaches with your rake, Lydia--short\nand quick ones are best.  Well, perhaps, as she is absolute mistress\nagain now, it is wise of her to resolve never to give up her\nfreedom.\"\n\n\"My mistress did certainly once say, though not seriously, that she\nsupposed she might marry again at the end of seven years from last\nyear, if she cared to risk Mr. Troy's coming back and claiming her.\"\n\n\"Ah, six years from the present time.  Said that she might.  She\nmight marry at once in every reasonable person's opinion, whatever\nthe lawyers may say to the contrary.\"\n\n\"Have you been to ask them?\" said Liddy, innocently.\n\n\"Not I,\" said Boldwood, growing red.  \"Liddy, you needn't stay here\na minute later than you wish, so Mr. Oak says.  I am now going on a\nlittle farther.  Good-afternoon.\"\n\nHe went away vexed with himself, and ashamed of having for this one\ntime in his life done anything which could be called underhand.  Poor\nBoldwood had no more skill in finesse than a battering-ram, and he\nwas uneasy with a sense of having made himself to appear stupid and,\nwhat was worse, mean.  But he had, after all, lighted upon one fact\nby way of repayment.  It was a singularly fresh and fascinating fact,\nand though not without its sadness it was pertinent and real.  In\nlittle more than six years from this time Bathsheba might certainly\nmarry him.  There was something definite in that hope, for admitting\nthat there might have been no deep thought in her words to Liddy\nabout marriage, they showed at least her creed on the matter.\n\nThis pleasant notion was now continually in his mind.  Six years were\na long time, but how much shorter than never, the idea he had for so\nlong been obliged to endure!  Jacob had served twice seven years for\nRachel: what were six for such a woman as this?  He tried to like the\nnotion of waiting for her better than that of winning her at once.\nBoldwood felt his love to be so deep and strong and eternal, that\nit was possible she had never yet known its full volume, and this\npatience in delay would afford him an opportunity of giving sweet\nproof on the point.  He would annihilate the six years of his life as\nif they were minutes--so little did he value his time on earth beside\nher love.  He would let her see, all those six years of intangible\nethereal courtship, how little care he had for anything but as it\nbore upon the consummation.\n\nMeanwhile the early and the late summer brought round the week in\nwhich Greenhill Fair was held.  This fair was frequently attended by\nthe folk of Weatherbury.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L\n\n\nTHE SHEEP FAIR--TROY TOUCHES HIS WIFE'S HAND\n\n\nGreenhill was the Nijni Novgorod of South Wessex; and the busiest,\nmerriest, noisiest day of the whole statute number was the day of\nthe sheep fair.  This yearly gathering was upon the summit of a\nhill which retained in good preservation the remains of an ancient\nearthwork, consisting of a huge rampart and entrenchment of an oval\nform encircling the top of the hill, though somewhat broken down here\nand there.  To each of the two chief openings on opposite sides a\nwinding road ascended, and the level green space of ten or fifteen\nacres enclosed by the bank was the site of the fair.  A few permanent\nerections dotted the spot, but the majority of visitors patronized\ncanvas alone for resting and feeding under during the time of their\nsojourn here.\n\nShepherds who attended with their flocks from long distances started\nfrom home two or three days, or even a week, before the fair, driving\ntheir charges a few miles each day--not more than ten or twelve--and\nresting them at night in hired fields by the wayside at previously\nchosen points, where they fed, having fasted since morning.  The\nshepherd of each flock marched behind, a bundle containing his kit\nfor the week strapped upon his shoulders, and in his hand his crook,\nwhich he used as the staff of his pilgrimage.  Several of the sheep\nwould get worn and lame, and occasionally a lambing occurred on the\nroad.  To meet these contingencies, there was frequently provided, to\naccompany the flocks from the remoter points, a pony and waggon into\nwhich the weakly ones were taken for the remainder of the journey.\n\nThe Weatherbury Farms, however, were no such long distance from the\nhill, and those arrangements were not necessary in their case.  But\nthe large united flocks of Bathsheba and Farmer Boldwood formed a\nvaluable and imposing multitude which demanded much attention, and\non this account Gabriel, in addition to Boldwood's shepherd and Cain\nBall, accompanied them along the way, through the decayed old town of\nKingsbere, and upward to the plateau,--old George the dog of course\nbehind them.\n\nWhen the autumn sun slanted over Greenhill this morning and lighted\nthe dewy flat upon its crest, nebulous clouds of dust were to be seen\nfloating between the pairs of hedges which streaked the wide prospect\naround in all directions.  These gradually converged upon the base of\nthe hill, and the flocks became individually visible, climbing the\nserpentine ways which led to the top.  Thus, in a slow procession,\nthey entered the opening to which the roads tended, multitude after\nmultitude, horned and hornless--blue flocks and red flocks, buff\nflocks and brown flocks, even green and salmon-tinted flocks,\naccording to the fancy of the colourist and custom of the farm.\nMen were shouting, dogs were barking, with greatest animation, but\nthe thronging travellers in so long a journey had grown nearly\nindifferent to such terrors, though they still bleated piteously at\nthe unwontedness of their experiences, a tall shepherd rising here\nand there in the midst of them, like a gigantic idol amid a crowd\nof prostrate devotees.\n\nThe great mass of sheep in the fair consisted of South Downs and the\nold Wessex horned breeds; to the latter class Bathsheba's and Farmer\nBoldwood's mainly belonged.  These filed in about nine o'clock, their\nvermiculated horns lopping gracefully on each side of their cheeks in\ngeometrically perfect spirals, a small pink and white ear nestling\nunder each horn.  Before and behind came other varieties, perfect\nleopards as to the full rich substance of their coats, and only\nlacking the spots.  There were also a few of the Oxfordshire breed,\nwhose wool was beginning to curl like a child's flaxen hair, though\nsurpassed in this respect by the effeminate Leicesters, which were in\nturn less curly than the Cotswolds.  But the most picturesque by far\nwas a small flock of Exmoors, which chanced to be there this year.\nTheir pied faces and legs, dark and heavy horns, tresses of wool\nhanging round their swarthy foreheads, quite relieved the monotony\nof the flocks in that quarter.\n\nAll these bleating, panting, and weary thousands had entered and were\npenned before the morning had far advanced, the dog belonging to each\nflock being tied to the corner of the pen containing it.  Alleys for\npedestrians intersected the pens, which soon became crowded with\nbuyers and sellers from far and near.\n\nIn another part of the hill an altogether different scene began\nto force itself upon the eye towards midday.  A circular tent, of\nexceptional newness and size, was in course of erection here.  As\nthe day drew on, the flocks began to change hands, lightening the\nshepherd's responsibilities; and they turned their attention to\nthis tent and inquired of a man at work there, whose soul seemed\nconcentrated on tying a bothering knot in no time, what was going\non.\n\n\"The Royal Hippodrome Performance of Turpin's Ride to York and the\nDeath of Black Bess,\" replied the man promptly, without turning his\neyes or leaving off tying.\n\nAs soon as the tent was completed the band struck up highly\nstimulating harmonies, and the announcement was publicly made, Black\nBess standing in a conspicuous position on the outside, as a living\nproof, if proof were wanted, of the truth of the oracular utterances\nfrom the stage over which the people were to enter.  These were so\nconvinced by such genuine appeals to heart and understanding both\nthat they soon began to crowd in abundantly, among the foremost being\nvisible Jan Coggan and Joseph Poorgrass, who were holiday keeping\nhere to-day.\n\n\"That's the great ruffen pushing me!\" screamed a woman in front of\nJan over her shoulder at him when the rush was at its fiercest.\n\n\"How can I help pushing ye when the folk behind push me?\" said\nCoggan, in a deprecating tone, turning his head towards the aforesaid\nfolk as far as he could without turning his body, which was jammed as\nin a vice.\n\nThere was a silence; then the drums and trumpets again sent forth\ntheir echoing notes.  The crowd was again ecstasied, and gave another\nlurch in which Coggan and Poorgrass were again thrust by those behind\nupon the women in front.\n\n\"Oh that helpless feymels should be at the mercy of such ruffens!\"\nexclaimed one of these ladies again, as she swayed like a reed shaken\nby the wind.\n\n\"Now,\" said Coggan, appealing in an earnest voice to the public at\nlarge as it stood clustered about his shoulder-blades, \"did ye ever\nhear such onreasonable woman as that?  Upon my carcase, neighbours,\nif I could only get out of this cheese-wring, the damn women might\neat the show for me!\"\n\n\"Don't ye lose yer temper, Jan!\" implored Joseph Poorgrass, in a\nwhisper.  \"They might get their men to murder us, for I think by the\nshine of their eyes that they be a sinful form of womankind.\"\n\nJan held his tongue, as if he had no objection to be pacified to\nplease a friend, and they gradually reached the foot of the ladder,\nPoorgrass being flattened like a jumping-jack, and the sixpence, for\nadmission, which he had got ready half-an-hour earlier, having become\nso reeking hot in the tight squeeze of his excited hand that the\nwoman in spangles, brazen rings set with glass diamonds, and with\nchalked face and shoulders, who took the money of him, hastily\ndropped it again from a fear that some trick had been played to burn\nher fingers.  So they all entered, and the cloth of the tent, to the\neyes of an observer on the outside, became bulged into innumerable\npimples such as we observe on a sack of potatoes, caused by the\nvarious human heads, backs, and elbows at high pressure within.\n\nAt the rear of the large tent there were two small dressing-tents.\nOne of these, alloted to the male performers, was partitioned into\nhalves by a cloth; and in one of the divisions there was sitting on\nthe grass, pulling on a pair of jack-boots, a young man whom we\ninstantly recognise as Sergeant Troy.\n\nTroy's appearance in this position may be briefly accounted for.  The\nbrig aboard which he was taken in Budmouth Roads was about to start\non a voyage, though somewhat short of hands.  Troy read the articles\nand joined, but before they sailed a boat was despatched across the\nbay to Lulwind cove; as he had half expected, his clothes were gone.\nHe ultimately worked his passage to the United States, where he made\na precarious living in various towns as Professor of Gymnastics,\nSword Exercise, Fencing, and Pugilism.  A few months were sufficient\nto give him a distaste for this kind of life.  There was a certain\nanimal form of refinement in his nature; and however pleasant a\nstrange condition might be whilst privations were easily warded off,\nit was disadvantageously coarse when money was short.  There was ever\npresent, too, the idea that he could claim a home and its comforts\ndid he but chose to return to England and Weatherbury Farm.  Whether\nBathsheba thought him dead was a frequent subject of curious\nconjecture.  To England he did return at last; but the fact of\ndrawing nearer to Weatherbury abstracted its fascinations, and his\nintention to enter his old groove at the place became modified.  It\nwas with gloom he considered on landing at Liverpool that if he\nwere to go home his reception would be of a kind very unpleasant\nto contemplate; for what Troy had in the way of emotion was an\noccasional fitful sentiment which sometimes caused him as much\ninconvenience as emotion of a strong and healthy kind.  Bathsheba was\nnot a woman to be made a fool of, or a woman to suffer in silence;\nand how could he endure existence with a spirited wife to whom at\nfirst entering he would be beholden for food and lodging?  Moreover,\nit was not at all unlikely that his wife would fail at her farming,\nif she had not already done so; and he would then become liable for\nher maintenance: and what a life such a future of poverty with her\nwould be, the spectre of Fanny constantly between them, harrowing\nhis temper and embittering her words!  Thus, for reasons touching on\ndistaste, regret, and shame commingled, he put off his return from\nday to day, and would have decided to put it off altogether if he\ncould have found anywhere else the ready-made establishment which\nexisted for him there.\n\nAt this time--the July preceding the September in which we find\nat Greenhill Fair--he fell in with a travelling circus which was\nperforming in the outskirts of a northern town.  Troy introduced\nhimself to the manager by taming a restive horse of the troupe,\nhitting a suspended apple with a pistol-bullet fired from the\nanimal's back when in full gallop, and other feats.  For his\nmerits in these--all more or less based upon his experiences as a\ndragoon-guardsman--Troy was taken into the company, and the play\nof Turpin was prepared with a view to his personation of the chief\ncharacter.  Troy was not greatly elated by the appreciative spirit in\nwhich he was undoubtedly treated, but he thought the engagement might\nafford him a few weeks for consideration.  It was thus carelessly,\nand without having formed any definite plan for the future, that Troy\nfound himself at Greenhill Fair with the rest of the company on this\nday.\n\nAnd now the mild autumn sun got lower, and in front of the pavilion\nthe following incident had taken place.  Bathsheba--who was driven\nto the fair that day by her odd man Poorgrass--had, like every one\nelse, read or heard the announcement that Mr. Francis, the Great\nCosmopolitan Equestrian and Roughrider, would enact the part of\nTurpin, and she was not yet too old and careworn to be without a\nlittle curiosity to see him.  This particular show was by far the\nlargest and grandest in the fair, a horde of little shows grouping\nthemselves under its shade like chickens around a hen.  The crowd had\npassed in, and Boldwood, who had been watching all the day for an\nopportunity of speaking to her, seeing her comparatively isolated,\ncame up to her side.\n\n\"I hope the sheep have done well to-day, Mrs. Troy?\" he said,\nnervously.\n\n\"Oh yes, thank you,\" said Bathsheba, colour springing up in the\ncentre of her cheeks.  \"I was fortunate enough to sell them all just\nas we got upon the hill, so we hadn't to pen at all.\"\n\n\"And now you are entirely at leisure?\"\n\n\"Yes, except that I have to see one more dealer in two hours' time:\notherwise I should be going home.  He was looking at this large tent\nand the announcement.  Have you ever seen the play of 'Turpin's Ride\nto York'?  Turpin was a real man, was he not?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, perfectly true--all of it.  Indeed, I think I've heard Jan\nCoggan say that a relation of his knew Tom King, Turpin's friend,\nquite well.\"\n\n\"Coggan is rather given to strange stories connected with his\nrelations, we must remember.  I hope they can all be believed.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; we know Coggan.  But Turpin is true enough.  You have\nnever seen it played, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Never.  I was not allowed to go into these places when I was young.\nHark!  What's that prancing?  How they shout!\"\n\n\"Black Bess just started off, I suppose.  Am I right in supposing\nyou would like to see the performance, Mrs. Troy?  Please excuse my\nmistake, if it is one; but if you would like to, I'll get a seat for\nyou with pleasure.\"  Perceiving that she hesitated, he added, \"I\nmyself shall not stay to see it: I've seen it before.\"\n\nNow Bathsheba did care a little to see the show, and had only\nwithheld her feet from the ladder because she feared to go in alone.\nShe had been hoping that Oak might appear, whose assistance in such\ncases was always accepted as an inalienable right, but Oak was\nnowhere to be seen; and hence it was that she said, \"Then if you will\njust look in first, to see if there's room, I think I will go in for\na minute or two.\"\n\nAnd so a short time after this Bathsheba appeared in the tent with\nBoldwood at her elbow, who, taking her to a \"reserved\" seat, again\nwithdrew.\n\nThis feature consisted of one raised bench in a very conspicuous\npart of the circle, covered with red cloth, and floored with a piece\nof carpet, and Bathsheba immediately found, to her confusion, that\nshe was the single reserved individual in the tent, the rest of\nthe crowded spectators, one and all, standing on their legs on the\nborders of the arena, where they got twice as good a view of the\nperformance for half the money.  Hence as many eyes were turned upon\nher, enthroned alone in this place of honour, against a scarlet\nbackground, as upon the ponies and clown who were engaged in\npreliminary exploits in the centre, Turpin not having yet appeared.\nOnce there, Bathsheba was forced to make the best of it and remain:\nshe sat down, spreading her skirts with some dignity over the\nunoccupied space on each side of her, and giving a new and feminine\naspect to the pavilion.  In a few minutes she noticed the fat red\nnape of Coggan's neck among those standing just below her, and Joseph\nPoorgrass's saintly profile a little further on.\n\nThe interior was shadowy with a peculiar shade.  The strange luminous\nsemi-opacities of fine autumn afternoons and eves intensified into\nRembrandt effects the few yellow sunbeams which came through holes\nand divisions in the canvas, and spirted like jets of gold-dust\nacross the dusky blue atmosphere of haze pervading the tent, until\nthey alighted on inner surfaces of cloth opposite, and shone like\nlittle lamps suspended there.\n\nTroy, on peeping from his dressing-tent through a slit for a\nreconnoitre before entering, saw his unconscious wife on high before\nhim as described, sitting as queen of the tournament.  He started\nback in utter confusion, for although his disguise effectually\nconcealed his personality, he instantly felt that she would be sure\nto recognize his voice.  He had several times during the day thought\nof the possibility of some Weatherbury person or other appearing and\nrecognizing him; but he had taken the risk carelessly.  If they see\nme, let them, he had said.  But here was Bathsheba in her own person;\nand the reality of the scene was so much intenser than any of his\nprefigurings that he felt he had not half enough considered the\npoint.\n\nShe looked so charming and fair that his cool mood about Weatherbury\npeople was changed.  He had not expected her to exercise this power\nover him in the twinkling of an eye.  Should he go on, and care\nnothing?  He could not bring himself to do that.  Beyond a politic\nwish to remain unknown, there suddenly arose in him now a sense of\nshame at the possibility that his attractive young wife, who already\ndespised him, should despise him more by discovering him in so mean a\ncondition after so long a time.  He actually blushed at the thought,\nand was vexed beyond measure that his sentiments of dislike towards\nWeatherbury should have led him to dally about the country in this\nway.\n\nBut Troy was never more clever than when absolutely at his wit's end.\nHe hastily thrust aside the curtain dividing his own little dressing\nspace from that of the manager and proprietor, who now appeared as\nthe individual called Tom King as far down as his waist, and as the\naforesaid respectable manager thence to his toes.\n\n\"Here's the devil to pay!\" said Troy.\n\n\"How's that?\"\n\n\"Why, there's a blackguard creditor in the tent I don't want to see,\nwho'll discover me and nab me as sure as Satan if I open my mouth.\nWhat's to be done?\"\n\n\"You must appear now, I think.\"\n\n\"I can't.\"\n\n\"But the play must proceed.\"\n\n\"Do you give out that Turpin has got a bad cold, and can't speak his\npart, but that he'll perform it just the same without speaking.\"\n\nThe proprietor shook his head.\n\n\"Anyhow, play or no play, I won't open my mouth,\" said Troy, firmly.\n\n\"Very well, then let me see.  I tell you how we'll manage,\" said the\nother, who perhaps felt it would be extremely awkward to offend his\nleading man just at this time.  \"I won't tell 'em anything about your\nkeeping silence; go on with the piece and say nothing, doing what\nyou can by a judicious wink now and then, and a few indomitable nods\nin the heroic places, you know.  They'll never find out that the\nspeeches are omitted.\"\n\nThis seemed feasible enough, for Turpin's speeches were not many or\nlong, the fascination of the piece lying entirely in the action; and\naccordingly the play began, and at the appointed time Black Bess\nleapt into the grassy circle amid the plaudits of the spectators.\nAt the turnpike scene, where Bess and Turpin are hotly pursued at\nmidnight by the officers, and the half-awake gatekeeper in his\ntasselled nightcap denies that any horseman has passed, Coggan\nuttered a broad-chested \"Well done!\" which could be heard all over\nthe fair above the bleating, and Poorgrass smiled delightedly with a\nnice sense of dramatic contrast between our hero, who coolly leaps\nthe gate, and halting justice in the form of his enemies, who must\nneeds pull up cumbersomely and wait to be let through.  At the death\nof Tom King, he could not refrain from seizing Coggan by the hand,\nand whispering, with tears in his eyes, \"Of course he's not really\nshot, Jan--only seemingly!\"  And when the last sad scene came on, and\nthe body of the gallant and faithful Bess had to be carried out on a\nshutter by twelve volunteers from among the spectators, nothing could\nrestrain Poorgrass from lending a hand, exclaiming, as he asked\nJan to join him, \"Twill be something to tell of at Warren's in\nfuture years, Jan, and hand down to our children.\"  For many a year\nin Weatherbury, Joseph told, with the air of a man who had had\nexperiences in his time, that he touched with his own hand the hoof\nof Bess as she lay upon the board upon his shoulder.  If, as some\nthinkers hold, immortality consists in being enshrined in others'\nmemories, then did Black Bess become immortal that day if she never\nhad done so before.\n\nMeanwhile Troy had added a few touches to his ordinary make-up for\nthe character, the more effectually to disguise himself, and though\nhe had felt faint qualms on first entering, the metamorphosis\neffected by judiciously \"lining\" his face with a wire rendered him\nsafe from the eyes of Bathsheba and her men.  Nevertheless, he was\nrelieved when it was got through.\n\nThere was a second performance in the evening, and the tent was\nlighted up.  Troy had taken his part very quietly this time,\nventuring to introduce a few speeches on occasion; and was just\nconcluding it when, whilst standing at the edge of the circle\ncontiguous to the first row of spectators, he observed within a\nyard of him the eye of a man darted keenly into his side features.\nTroy hastily shifted his position, after having recognized in the\nscrutineer the knavish bailiff Pennyways, his wife's sworn enemy,\nwho still hung about the outskirts of Weatherbury.\n\nAt first Troy resolved to take no notice and abide by circumstances.\nThat he had been recognized by this man was highly probable; yet\nthere was room for a doubt.  Then the great objection he had felt to\nallowing news of his proximity to precede him to Weatherbury in the\nevent of his return, based on a feeling that knowledge of his present\noccupation would discredit him still further in his wife's eyes,\nreturned in full force.  Moreover, should he resolve not to return at\nall, a tale of his being alive and being in the neighbourhood would\nbe awkward; and he was anxious to acquire a knowledge of his wife's\ntemporal affairs before deciding which to do.\n\nIn this dilemma Troy at once went out to reconnoitre.  It occurred\nto him that to find Pennyways, and make a friend of him if possible,\nwould be a very wise act.  He had put on a thick beard borrowed from\nthe establishment, and in this he wandered about the fair-field.  It\nwas now almost dark, and respectable people were getting their carts\nand gigs ready to go home.\n\nThe largest refreshment booth in the fair was provided by an\ninnkeeper from a neighbouring town.  This was considered an\nunexceptionable place for obtaining the necessary food and rest:\nHost Trencher (as he was jauntily called by the local newspaper)\nbeing a substantial man of high repute for catering through all the\ncountry round.  The tent was divided into first and second-class\ncompartments, and at the end of the first-class division was a yet\nfurther enclosure for the most exclusive, fenced off from the body\nof the tent by a luncheon-bar, behind which the host himself stood\nbustling about in white apron and shirt-sleeves, and looking as if\nhe had never lived anywhere but under canvas all his life.  In these\npenetralia were chairs and a table, which, on candles being lighted,\nmade quite a cozy and luxurious show, with an urn, plated tea and\ncoffee pots, china teacups, and plum cakes.\n\nTroy stood at the entrance to the booth, where a gipsy-woman was\nfrying pancakes over a little fire of sticks and selling them at a\npenny a-piece, and looked over the heads of the people within.  He\ncould see nothing of Pennyways, but he soon discerned Bathsheba\nthrough an opening into the reserved space at the further end.  Troy\nthereupon retreated, went round the tent into the darkness, and\nlistened.  He could hear Bathsheba's voice immediately inside the\ncanvas; she was conversing with a man.  A warmth overspread his\nface: surely she was not so unprincipled as to flirt in a fair!\nHe wondered if, then, she reckoned upon his death as an absolute\ncertainty.  To get at the root of the matter, Troy took a penknife\nfrom his pocket and softly made two little cuts crosswise in the\ncloth, which, by folding back the corners left a hole the size of a\nwafer.  Close to this he placed his face, withdrawing it again in a\nmovement of surprise; for his eye had been within twelve inches of\nthe top of Bathsheba's head.  It was too near to be convenient.  He\nmade another hole a little to one side and lower down, in a shaded\nplace beside her chair, from which it was easy and safe to survey\nher by looking horizontally.\n\nTroy took in the scene completely now.  She was leaning back, sipping\na cup of tea that she held in her hand, and the owner of the male\nvoice was Boldwood, who had apparently just brought the cup to her,\nBathsheba, being in a negligent mood, leant so idly against the\ncanvas that it was pressed to the shape of her shoulder, and she was,\nin fact, as good as in Troy's arms; and he was obliged to keep his\nbreast carefully backward that she might not feel its warmth through\nthe cloth as he gazed in.\n\nTroy found unexpected chords of feeling to be stirred again within\nhim as they had been stirred earlier in the day.  She was handsome\nas ever, and she was his.  It was some minutes before he could\ncounteract his sudden wish to go in, and claim her.  Then he thought\nhow the proud girl who had always looked down upon him even whilst it\nwas to love him, would hate him on discovering him to be a strolling\nplayer.  Were he to make himself known, that chapter of his life\nmust at all risks be kept for ever from her and from the Weatherbury\npeople, or his name would be a byword throughout the parish.  He\nwould be nicknamed \"Turpin\" as long as he lived.  Assuredly before\nhe could claim her these few past months of his existence must be\nentirely blotted out.\n\n\"Shall I get you another cup before you start, ma'am?\" said Farmer\nBoldwood.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Bathsheba.  \"But I must be going at once.  It was\ngreat neglect in that man to keep me waiting here till so late.  I\nshould have gone two hours ago, if it had not been for him.  I had no\nidea of coming in here; but there's nothing so refreshing as a cup of\ntea, though I should never have got one if you hadn't helped me.\"\n\nTroy scrutinized her cheek as lit by the candles, and watched each\nvarying shade thereon, and the white shell-like sinuosities of her\nlittle ear.  She took out her purse and was insisting to Boldwood on\npaying for her tea for herself, when at this moment Pennyways entered\nthe tent.  Troy trembled: here was his scheme for respectability\nendangered at once.  He was about to leave his hole of espial,\nattempt to follow Pennyways, and find out if the ex-bailiff had\nrecognized him, when he was arrested by the conversation, and found\nhe was too late.\n\n\"Excuse me, ma'am,\" said Pennyways; \"I've some private information\nfor your ear alone.\"\n\n\"I cannot hear it now,\" she said, coldly.  That Bathsheba could not\nendure this man was evident; in fact, he was continually coming to\nher with some tale or other, by which he might creep into favour at\nthe expense of persons maligned.\n\n\"I'll write it down,\" said Pennyways, confidently.  He stooped over\nthe table, pulled a leaf from a warped pocket-book, and wrote upon\nthe paper, in a round hand--\n\n\"YOUR HUSBAND IS HERE.  I'VE SEEN HIM.  WHO'S THE FOOL NOW?\"\n\nThis he folded small, and handed towards her.  Bathsheba would not\nread it; she would not even put out her hand to take it.  Pennyways,\nthen, with a laugh of derision, tossed it into her lap, and, turning\naway, left her.\n\nFrom the words and action of Pennyways, Troy, though he had not been\nable to see what the ex-bailiff wrote, had not a moment's doubt that\nthe note referred to him.  Nothing that he could think of could be\ndone to check the exposure.  \"Curse my luck!\" he whispered, and\nadded imprecations which rustled in the gloom like a pestilent wind.\nMeanwhile Boldwood said, taking up the note from her lap--\n\n\"Don't you wish to read it, Mrs. Troy?  If not, I'll destroy it.\"\n\n\"Oh, well,\" said Bathsheba, carelessly, \"perhaps it is unjust not to\nread it; but I can guess what it is about.  He wants me to recommend\nhim, or it is to tell me of some little scandal or another connected\nwith my work-people.  He's always doing that.\"\n\nBathsheba held the note in her right hand.  Boldwood handed towards\nher a plate of cut bread-and-butter; when, in order to take a slice,\nshe put the note into her left hand, where she was still holding\nthe purse, and then allowed her hand to drop beside her close to\nthe canvas.  The moment had come for saving his game, and Troy\nimpulsively felt that he would play the card.  For yet another time\nhe looked at the fair hand, and saw the pink finger-tips, and the\nblue veins of the wrist, encircled by a bracelet of coral chippings\nwhich she wore: how familiar it all was to him!  Then, with the\nlightning action in which he was such an adept, he noiselessly\nslipped his hand under the bottom of the tent-cloth, which was far\nfrom being pinned tightly down, lifted it a little way, keeping his\neye to the hole, snatched the note from her fingers, dropped the\ncanvas, and ran away in the gloom towards the bank and ditch, smiling\nat the scream of astonishment which burst from her.  Troy then slid\ndown on the outside of the rampart, hastened round in the bottom of\nthe entrenchment to a distance of a hundred yards, ascended again,\nand crossed boldly in a slow walk towards the front entrance of\nthe tent.  His object was now to get to Pennyways, and prevent a\nrepetition of the announcement until such time as he should choose.\n\nTroy reached the tent door, and standing among the groups there\ngathered, looked anxiously for Pennyways, evidently not wishing to\nmake himself prominent by inquiring for him.  One or two men were\nspeaking of a daring attempt that had just been made to rob a young\nlady by lifting the canvas of the tent beside her.  It was supposed\nthat the rogue had imagined a slip of paper which she held in her\nhand to be a bank note, for he had seized it, and made off with\nit, leaving her purse behind.  His chagrin and disappointment at\ndiscovering its worthlessness would be a good joke, it was said.\nHowever, the occurrence seemed to have become known to few, for it\nhad not interrupted a fiddler, who had lately begun playing by the\ndoor of the tent, nor the four bowed old men with grim countenances\nand walking-sticks in hand, who were dancing \"Major Malley's Reel\"\nto the tune.  Behind these stood Pennyways.  Troy glided up to him,\nbeckoned, and whispered a few words; and with a mutual glance of\nconcurrence the two men went into the night together.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI\n\n\nBATHSHEBA TALKS WITH HER OUTRIDER\n\n\nThe arrangement for getting back again to Weatherbury had been that\nOak should take the place of Poorgrass in Bathsheba's conveyance and\ndrive her home, it being discovered late in the afternoon that Joseph\nwas suffering from his old complaint, a multiplying eye, and was,\ntherefore, hardly trustworthy as coachman and protector to a woman.\nBut Oak had found himself so occupied, and was full of so many\ncares relative to those portions of Boldwood's flocks that were not\ndisposed of, that Bathsheba, without telling Oak or anybody, resolved\nto drive home herself, as she had many times done from Casterbridge\nMarket, and trust to her good angel for performing the journey\nunmolested.  But having fallen in with Farmer Boldwood accidentally\n(on her part at least) at the refreshment-tent, she found it\nimpossible to refuse his offer to ride on horseback beside her as\nescort.  It had grown twilight before she was aware, but Boldwood\nassured her that there was no cause for uneasiness, as the moon\nwould be up in half-an-hour.\n\nImmediately after the incident in the tent, she had risen to\ngo--now absolutely alarmed and really grateful for her old lover's\nprotection--though regretting Gabriel's absence, whose company she\nwould have much preferred, as being more proper as well as more\npleasant, since he was her own managing-man and servant.  This,\nhowever, could not be helped; she would not, on any consideration,\ntreat Boldwood harshly, having once already ill-used him, and the\nmoon having risen, and the gig being ready, she drove across the\nhilltop in the wending way's which led downwards--to oblivious\nobscurity, as it seemed, for the moon and the hill it flooded with\nlight were in appearance on a level, the rest of the world lying as\na vast shady concave between them.  Boldwood mounted his horse, and\nfollowed in close attendance behind.  Thus they descended into the\nlowlands, and the sounds of those left on the hill came like voices\nfrom the sky, and the lights were as those of a camp in heaven.  They\nsoon passed the merry stragglers in the immediate vicinity of the\nhill, traversed Kingsbere, and got upon the high road.\n\nThe keen instincts of Bathsheba had perceived that the farmer's\nstaunch devotion to herself was still undiminished, and she\nsympathized deeply.  The sight had quite depressed her this evening;\nhad reminded her of her folly; she wished anew, as she had wished\nmany months ago, for some means of making reparation for her fault.\nHence her pity for the man who so persistently loved on to his own\ninjury and permanent gloom had betrayed Bathsheba into an injudicious\nconsiderateness of manner, which appeared almost like tenderness,\nand gave new vigour to the exquisite dream of a Jacob's seven years\nservice in poor Boldwood's mind.\n\nHe soon found an excuse for advancing from his position in the rear,\nand rode close by her side.  They had gone two or three miles in\nthe moonlight, speaking desultorily across the wheel of her gig\nconcerning the fair, farming, Oak's usefulness to them both, and\nother indifferent subjects, when Boldwood said suddenly and simply--\n\n\"Mrs. Troy, you will marry again some day?\"\n\nThis point-blank query unmistakably confused her, and it was not till\na minute or more had elapsed that she said, \"I have not seriously\nthought of any such subject.\"\n\n\"I quite understand that.  Yet your late husband has been dead nearly\none year, and--\"\n\n\"You forget that his death was never absolutely proved, and may not\nhave taken place; so that I may not be really a widow,\" she said,\ncatching at the straw of escape that the fact afforded.\n\n\"Not absolutely proved, perhaps, but it was proved circumstantially.\nA man saw him drowning, too.  No reasonable person has any doubt of\nhis death; nor have you, ma'am, I should imagine.\"\n\n\"I have none now, or I should have acted differently,\" she said,\ngently.  \"I certainly, at first, had a strange unaccountable feeling\nthat he could not have perished, but I have been able to explain that\nin several ways since.  But though I am fully persuaded that I shall\nsee him no more, I am far from thinking of marriage with another.  I\nshould be very contemptible to indulge in such a thought.\"\n\nThey were silent now awhile, and having struck into an unfrequented\ntrack across a common, the creaks of Boldwood's saddle and her gig\nsprings were all the sounds to be heard. Boldwood ended the pause.\n\n\"Do you remember when I carried you fainting in my arms into the\nKing's Arms, in Casterbridge?  Every dog has his day: that was mine.\"\n\n\"I know--I know it all,\" she said, hurriedly.\n\n\"I, for one, shall never cease regretting that events so fell out as\nto deny you to me.\"\n\n\"I, too, am very sorry,\" she said, and then checked herself.  \"I\nmean, you know, I am sorry you thought I--\"\n\n\"I have always this dreary pleasure in thinking over those past times\nwith you--that I was something to you before HE was anything, and\nthat you belonged ALMOST to me.  But, of course, that's nothing.  You\nnever liked me.\"\n\n\"I did; and respected you, too.\"\n\n\"Do you now?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Which?\"\n\n\"How do you mean which?\"\n\n\"Do you like me, or do you respect me?\"\n\n\"I don't know--at least, I cannot tell you.  It is difficult for a\nwoman to define her feelings in language which is chiefly made by men\nto express theirs.  My treatment of you was thoughtless, inexcusable,\nwicked!  I shall eternally regret it.  If there had been anything\nI could have done to make amends I would most gladly have done\nit--there was nothing on earth I so longed to do as to repair the\nerror.  But that was not possible.\"\n\n\"Don't blame yourself--you were not so far in the wrong as you\nsuppose.  Bathsheba, suppose you had real complete proof that you are\nwhat, in fact, you are--a widow--would you repair the old wrong to me\nby marrying me?\"\n\n\"I cannot say.  I shouldn't yet, at any rate.\"\n\n\"But you might at some future time of your life?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I might at some time.\"\n\n\"Well, then, do you know that without further proof of any kind you\nmay marry again in about six years from the present--subject to\nnobody's objection or blame?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" she said, quickly.  \"I know all that.  But don't talk of\nit--seven or six years--where may we all be by that time?\"\n\n\"They will soon glide by, and it will seem an astonishingly short\ntime to look back upon when they are past--much less than to look\nforward to now.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; I have found that in my own experience.\"\n\n\"Now listen once more,\" Boldwood pleaded.  \"If I wait that time, will\nyou marry me?  You own that you owe me amends--let that be your way\nof making them.\"\n\n\"But, Mr. Boldwood--six years--\"\n\n\"Do you want to be the wife of any other man?\"\n\n\"No indeed!  I mean, that I don't like to talk about this matter now.\nPerhaps it is not proper, and I ought not to allow it.  Let us drop\nit.  My husband may be living, as I said.\"\n\n\"Of course, I'll drop the subject if you wish.  But propriety has\nnothing to do with reasons.  I am a middle-aged man, willing to\nprotect you for the remainder of our lives.  On your side, at least,\nthere is no passion or blamable haste--on mine, perhaps, there is.\nBut I can't help seeing that if you choose from a feeling of pity,\nand, as you say, a wish to make amends, to make a bargain with me for\na far-ahead time--an agreement which will set all things right and\nmake me happy, late though it may be--there is no fault to be found\nwith you as a woman.  Hadn't I the first place beside you?  Haven't\nyou been almost mine once already?  Surely you can say to me as much\nas this, you will have me back again should circumstances permit?\nNow, pray speak!  O Bathsheba, promise--it is only a little\npromise--that if you marry again, you will marry me!\"\n\nHis tone was so excited that she almost feared him at this moment,\neven whilst she sympathized.  It was a simple physical fear--the weak\nof the strong; there was no emotional aversion or inner repugnance.\nShe said, with some distress in her voice, for she remembered vividly\nhis outburst on the Yalbury Road, and shrank from a repetition of his\nanger:--\n\n\"I will never marry another man whilst you wish me to be your wife,\nwhatever comes--but to say more--you have taken me so by surprise--\"\n\n\"But let it stand in these simple words--that in six years' time you\nwill be my wife?  Unexpected accidents we'll not mention, because\nthose, of course, must be given way to.  Now, this time I know you\nwill keep your word.\"\n\n\"That's why I hesitate to give it.\"\n\n\"But do give it!  Remember the past, and be kind.\"\n\nShe breathed; and then said mournfully: \"Oh what shall I do?  I don't\nlove you, and I much fear that I never shall love you as much as a\nwoman ought to love a husband.  If you, sir, know that, and I can\nyet give you happiness by a mere promise to marry at the end of six\nyears, if my husband should not come back, it is a great honour to\nme.  And if you value such an act of friendship from a woman who\ndoesn't esteem herself as she did, and has little love left, why\nI--I will--\"\n\n\"Promise!\"\n\n\"--Consider, if I cannot promise soon.\"\n\n\"But soon is perhaps never?\"\n\n\"Oh no, it is not!  I mean soon.  Christmas, we'll say.\"\n\n\"Christmas!\"  He said nothing further till he added: \"Well, I'll say\nno more to you about it till that time.\"\n\n\nBathsheba was in a very peculiar state of mind, which showed how\nentirely the soul is the slave of the body, the ethereal spirit\ndependent for its quality upon the tangible flesh and blood.  It is\nhardly too much to say that she felt coerced by a force stronger than\nher own will, not only into the act of promising upon this singularly\nremote and vague matter, but into the emotion of fancying that she\nought to promise.  When the weeks intervening between the night of\nthis conversation and Christmas day began perceptibly to diminish,\nher anxiety and perplexity increased.\n\nOne day she was led by an accident into an oddly confidential\ndialogue with Gabriel about her difficulty.  It afforded her a little\nrelief--of a dull and cheerless kind.  They were auditing accounts,\nand something occurred in the course of their labours which led Oak\nto say, speaking of Boldwood, \"He'll never forget you, ma'am, never.\"\n\nThen out came her trouble before she was aware; and she told him how\nshe had again got into the toils; what Boldwood had asked her, and\nhow he was expecting her assent.  \"The most mournful reason of all\nfor my agreeing to it,\" she said sadly, \"and the true reason why I\nthink to do so for good or for evil, is this--it is a thing I have\nnot breathed to a living soul as yet--I believe that if I don't give\nmy word, he'll go out of his mind.\"\n\n\"Really, do ye?\" said Gabriel, gravely.\n\n\"I believe this,\" she continued, with reckless frankness; \"and Heaven\nknows I say it in a spirit the very reverse of vain, for I am grieved\nand troubled to my soul about it--I believe I hold that man's future\nin my hand.  His career depends entirely upon my treatment of him.  O\nGabriel, I tremble at my responsibility, for it is terrible!\"\n\n\"Well, I think this much, ma'am, as I told you years ago,\" said Oak,\n\"that his life is a total blank whenever he isn't hoping for 'ee; but\nI can't suppose--I hope that nothing so dreadful hangs on to it as\nyou fancy.  His natural manner has always been dark and strange, you\nknow.  But since the case is so sad and odd-like, why don't ye give\nthe conditional promise?  I think I would.\"\n\n\"But is it right?  Some rash acts of my past life have taught me that\na watched woman must have very much circumspection to retain only a\nvery little credit, and I do want and long to be discreet in this!\nAnd six years--why we may all be in our graves by that time, even if\nMr. Troy does not come back again, which he may not impossibly do!\nSuch thoughts give a sort of absurdity to the scheme.  Now, isn't\nit preposterous, Gabriel?  However he came to dream of it, I cannot\nthink.  But is it wrong?  You know--you are older than I.\"\n\n\"Eight years older, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Yes, eight years--and is it wrong?\"\n\n\"Perhaps it would be an uncommon agreement for a man and woman to\nmake: I don't see anything really wrong about it,\" said Oak, slowly.\n\"In fact the very thing that makes it doubtful if you ought to marry\nen under any condition, that is, your not caring about him--for I\nmay suppose--\"\n\n\"Yes, you may suppose that love is wanting,\" she said shortly.  \"Love\nis an utterly bygone, sorry, worn-out, miserable thing with me--for\nhim or any one else.\"\n\n\"Well, your want of love seems to me the one thing that takes away\nharm from such an agreement with him.  If wild heat had to do wi'\nit, making ye long to over-come the awkwardness about your husband's\nvanishing, it mid be wrong; but a cold-hearted agreement to oblige a\nman seems different, somehow.  The real sin, ma'am in my mind, lies\nin thinking of ever wedding wi' a man you don't love honest and\ntrue.\"\n\n\"That I'm willing to pay the penalty of,\" said Bathsheba, firmly.\n\"You know, Gabriel, this is what I cannot get off my conscience--that\nI once seriously injured him in sheer idleness.  If I had never\nplayed a trick upon him, he would never have wanted to marry me.  Oh\nif I could only pay some heavy damages in money to him for the harm\nI did, and so get the sin off my soul that way!...  Well, there's\nthe debt, which can only be discharged in one way, and I believe\nI am bound to do it if it honestly lies in my power, without any\nconsideration of my own future at all.  When a rake gambles away his\nexpectations, the fact that it is an inconvenient debt doesn't make\nhim the less liable.  I've been a rake, and the single point I ask\nyou is, considering that my own scruples, and the fact that in the\neye of the law my husband is only missing, will keep any man from\nmarrying me until seven years have passed--am I free to entertain\nsuch an idea, even though 'tis a sort of penance--for it will be\nthat?  I HATE the act of marriage under such circumstances, and the\nclass of women I should seem to belong to by doing it!\"\n\n\"It seems to me that all depends upon whe'r you think, as everybody\nelse do, that your husband is dead.\"\n\n\"Yes--I've long ceased to doubt that.  I well know what would have\nbrought him back long before this time if he had lived.\"\n\n\"Well, then, in a religious sense you will be as free to THINK o'\nmarrying again as any real widow of one year's standing.  But why\ndon't ye ask Mr. Thirdly's advice on how to treat Mr. Boldwood?\"\n\n\"No.  When I want a broad-minded opinion for general enlightenment,\ndistinct from special advice, I never go to a man who deals in\nthe subject professionally.  So I like the parson's opinion on\nlaw, the lawyer's on doctoring, the doctor's on business, and my\nbusiness-man's--that is, yours--on morals.\"\n\n\"And on love--\"\n\n\"My own.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid there's a hitch in that argument,\" said Oak, with a grave\nsmile.\n\nShe did not reply at once, and then saying, \"Good evening, Mr. Oak.\"\nwent away.\n\nShe had spoken frankly, and neither asked nor expected any reply\nfrom Gabriel more satisfactory than that she had obtained.  Yet in\nthe centremost parts of her complicated heart there existed at this\nminute a little pang of disappointment, for a reason she would not\nallow herself to recognize.  Oak had not once wished her free that he\nmight marry her himself--had not once said, \"I could wait for you as\nwell as he.\"  That was the insect sting.  Not that she would have\nlistened to any such hypothesis.  O no--for wasn't she saying all\nthe time that such thoughts of the future were improper, and wasn't\nGabriel far too poor a man to speak sentiment to her?  Yet he might\nhave just hinted about that old love of his, and asked, in a playful\noff-hand way, if he might speak of it.  It would have seemed pretty\nand sweet, if no more; and then she would have shown how kind and\ninoffensive a woman's \"No\" can sometimes be.  But to give such cool\nadvice--the very advice she had asked for--it ruffled our heroine all\nthe afternoon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII\n\n\nCONVERGING COURSES\n\n\nI\n\n\nChristmas-eve came, and a party that Boldwood was to give in the\nevening was the great subject of talk in Weatherbury.  It was not\nthat the rarity of Christmas parties in the parish made this one a\nwonder, but that Boldwood should be the giver.  The announcement\nhad had an abnormal and incongruous sound, as if one should hear of\ncroquet-playing in a cathedral aisle, or that some much-respected\njudge was going upon the stage.  That the party was intended to be\na truly jovial one there was no room for doubt.  A large bough of\nmistletoe had been brought from the woods that day, and suspended\nin the hall of the bachelor's home.  Holly and ivy had followed in\narmfuls.  From six that morning till past noon the huge wood fire\nin the kitchen roared and sparkled at its highest, the kettle, the\nsaucepan, and the three-legged pot appearing in the midst of the\nflames like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; moreover, roasting\nand basting operations were continually carried on in front of the\ngenial blaze.\n\nAs it grew later the fire was made up in the large long hall into\nwhich the staircase descended, and all encumbrances were cleared out\nfor dancing.  The log which was to form the back-brand of the evening\nfire was the uncleft trunk of a tree, so unwieldy that it could be\nneither brought nor rolled to its place; and accordingly two men were\nto be observed dragging and heaving it in by chains and levers as the\nhour of assembly drew near.\n\nIn spite of all this, the spirit of revelry was wanting in the\natmosphere of the house.  Such a thing had never been attempted\nbefore by its owner, and it was now done as by a wrench.  Intended\ngaieties would insist upon appearing like solemn grandeurs, the\norganization of the whole effort was carried out coldly, by\nhirelings, and a shadow seemed to move about the rooms, saying that\nthe proceedings were unnatural to the place and the lone man who\nlived therein, and hence not good.\n\n\nII\n\n\nBathsheba was at this time in her room, dressing for the event.  She\nhad called for candles, and Liddy entered and placed one on each side\nof her mistress's glass.\n\n\"Don't go away, Liddy,\" said Bathsheba, almost timidly. \"I am\nfoolishly agitated--I cannot tell why.  I wish I had not been obliged\nto go to this dance; but there's no escaping now.  I have not spoken\nto Mr. Boldwood since the autumn, when I promised to see him at\nChristmas on business, but I had no idea there was to be anything of\nthis kind.\"\n\n\"But I would go now,\" said Liddy, who was going with her; for\nBoldwood had been indiscriminate in his invitations.\n\n\"Yes, I shall make my appearance, of course,\" said Bathsheba.  \"But I\nam THE CAUSE of the party, and that upsets me!--Don't tell, Liddy.\"\n\n\"Oh no, ma'am.  You the cause of it, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Yes.  I am the reason of the party--I.  If it had not been for me,\nthere would never have been one.  I can't explain any more--there's\nno more to be explained.  I wish I had never seen Weatherbury.\"\n\n\"That's wicked of you--to wish to be worse off than you are.\"\n\n\"No, Liddy.  I have never been free from trouble since I have lived\nhere, and this party is likely to bring me more.  Now, fetch my black\nsilk dress, and see how it sits upon me.\"\n\n\"But you will leave off that, surely, ma'am?  You have been a\nwidow-lady fourteen months, and ought to brighten up a little on\nsuch a night as this.\"\n\n\"Is it necessary?  No; I will appear as usual, for if I were to wear\nany light dress people would say things about me, and I should seem\nto be rejoicing when I am solemn all the time.  The party doesn't\nsuit me a bit; but never mind, stay and help to finish me off.\"\n\n\nIII\n\n\nBoldwood was dressing also at this hour.  A tailor from Casterbridge\nwas with him, assisting him in the operation of trying on a new coat\nthat had just been brought home.\n\nNever had Boldwood been so fastidious, unreasonable about the fit,\nand generally difficult to please.  The tailor walked round and round\nhim, tugged at the waist, pulled the sleeve, pressed out the collar,\nand for the first time in his experience Boldwood was not bored.\nTimes had been when the farmer had exclaimed against all such\nniceties as childish, but now no philosophic or hasty rebuke whatever\nwas provoked by this man for attaching as much importance to a crease\nin the coat as to an earthquake in South America.  Boldwood at last\nexpressed himself nearly satisfied, and paid the bill, the tailor\npassing out of the door just as Oak came in to report progress for\nthe day.\n\n\"Oh, Oak,\" said Boldwood.  \"I shall of course see you here to-night.\nMake yourself merry.  I am determined that neither expense nor\ntrouble shall be spared.\"\n\n\"I'll try to be here, sir, though perhaps it may not be very early,\"\nsaid Gabriel, quietly.  \"I am glad indeed to see such a change in\n'ee from what it used to be.\"\n\n\"Yes--I must own it--I am bright to-night: cheerful and more than\ncheerful--so much so that I am almost sad again with the sense that\nall of it is passing away.  And sometimes, when I am excessively\nhopeful and blithe, a trouble is looming in the distance: so that I\noften get to look upon gloom in me with content, and to fear a happy\nmood.  Still this may be absurd--I feel that it is absurd.  Perhaps\nmy day is dawning at last.\"\n\n\"I hope it 'ill be a long and a fair one.\"\n\n\"Thank you--thank you.  Yet perhaps my cheerfulness rests on a\nslender hope.  And yet I trust my hope.  It is faith, not hope.  I\nthink this time I reckon with my host.--Oak, my hands are a little\nshaky, or something; I can't tie this neckerchief properly.  Perhaps\nyou will tie it for me.  The fact is, I have not been well lately,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to hear that, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing.  I want it done as well as you can, please.  Is\nthere any late knot in fashion, Oak?\"\n\n\"I don't know, sir,\" said Oak.  His tone had sunk to sadness.\n\nBoldwood approached Gabriel, and as Oak tied the neckerchief the\nfarmer went on feverishly--\n\n\"Does a woman keep her promise, Gabriel?\"\n\n\"If it is not inconvenient to her she may.\"\n\n\"--Or rather an implied promise.\"\n\n\"I won't answer for her implying,\" said Oak, with faint bitterness.\n\"That's a word as full o' holes as a sieve with them.\"\n\n\"Oak, don't talk like that.  You have got quite cynical lately--how\nis it?  We seem to have shifted our positions: I have become the\nyoung and hopeful man, and you the old and unbelieving one.  However,\ndoes a woman keep a promise, not to marry, but to enter on an\nengagement to marry at some time?  Now you know women better than\nI--tell me.\"\n\n\"I am afeard you honour my understanding too much.  However, she may\nkeep such a promise, if it is made with an honest meaning to repair\na wrong.\"\n\n\"It has not gone far yet, but I think it will soon--yes, I know it\nwill,\" he said, in an impulsive whisper.  \"I have pressed her upon\nthe subject, and she inclines to be kind to me, and to think of me\nas a husband at a long future time, and that's enough for me.  How\ncan I expect more?  She has a notion that a woman should not marry\nwithin seven years of her husband's disappearance--that her own self\nshouldn't, I mean--because his body was not found.  It may be merely\nthis legal reason which influences her, or it may be a religious\none, but she is reluctant to talk on the point. Yet she has\npromised--implied--that she will ratify an engagement to-night.\"\n\n\"Seven years,\" murmured Oak.\n\n\"No, no--it's no such thing!\" he said, with impatience.  \"Five years,\nnine months, and a few days.  Fifteen months nearly have passed since\nhe vanished, and is there anything so wonderful in an engagement of\nlittle more than five years?\"\n\n\"It seems long in a forward view.  Don't build too much upon such\npromises, sir.  Remember, you have once be'n deceived.  Her meaning\nmay be good; but there--she's young yet.\"\n\n\"Deceived?  Never!\" said Boldwood, vehemently.  \"She never promised\nme at that first time, and hence she did not break her promise!  If\nshe promises me, she'll marry me.  Bathsheba is a woman to her word.\"\n\n\nIV\n\n\nTroy was sitting in a corner of The White Hart tavern at\nCasterbridge, smoking and drinking a steaming mixture from a glass.\nA knock was given at the door, and Pennyways entered.\n\n\"Well, have you seen him?\" Troy inquired, pointing to a chair.\n\n\"Boldwood?\"\n\n\"No--Lawyer Long.\"\n\n\"He wadn' at home.  I went there first, too.\"\n\n\"That's a nuisance.\"\n\n\"'Tis rather, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Yet I don't see that, because a man appears to be drowned and was\nnot, he should be liable for anything.  I shan't ask any lawyer--not\nI.\"\n\n\"But that's not it, exactly.  If a man changes his name and so forth,\nand takes steps to deceive the world and his own wife, he's a cheat,\nand that in the eye of the law is ayless a rogue, and that is ayless\na lammocken vagabond; and that's a punishable situation.\"\n\n\"Ha-ha!  Well done, Pennyways,\" Troy had laughed, but it was with\nsome anxiety that he said, \"Now, what I want to know is this, do you\nthink there's really anything going on between her and Boldwood?\nUpon my soul, I should never have believed it!  How she must detest\nme!  Have you found out whether she has encouraged him?\"\n\n\"I haen't been able to learn.  There's a deal of feeling on his side\nseemingly, but I don't answer for her.  I didn't know a word about\nany such thing till yesterday, and all I heard then was that she was\ngwine to the party at his house to-night.  This is the first time she\nhas ever gone there, they say.  And they say that she've not so much\nas spoke to him since they were at Greenhill Fair: but what can folk\nbelieve o't?  However, she's not fond of him--quite offish and quite\ncareless, I know.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that....  She's a handsome woman, Pennyways, is\nshe not?  Own that you never saw a finer or more splendid creature\nin your life.  Upon my honour, when I set eyes upon her that day I\nwondered what I could have been made of to be able to leave her by\nherself so long.  And then I was hampered with that bothering show,\nwhich I'm free of at last, thank the stars.\"  He smoked on awhile,\nand then added, \"How did she look when you passed by yesterday?\"\n\n\"Oh, she took no great heed of me, ye may well fancy; but she looked\nwell enough, far's I know.  Just flashed her haughty eyes upon my\npoor scram body, and then let them go past me to what was yond, much\nas if I'd been no more than a leafless tree.  She had just got off\nher mare to look at the last wring-down of cider for the year; she\nhad been riding, and so her colours were up and her breath rather\nquick, so that her bosom plimmed and fell--plimmed and fell--every\ntime plain to my eye.  Ay, and there were the fellers round her\nwringing down the cheese and bustling about and saying, 'Ware o' the\npommy, ma'am: 'twill spoil yer gown.'  'Never mind me,' says she.\nThen Gabe brought her some of the new cider, and she must needs go\ndrinking it through a strawmote, and not in a nateral way at all.\n'Liddy,' says she, 'bring indoors a few gallons, and I'll make some\ncider-wine.'  Sergeant, I was no more to her than a morsel of scroff\nin the fuel-house!\"\n\n\"I must go and find her out at once--O yes, I see that--I must go.\nOak is head man still, isn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes, 'a b'lieve.  And at Little Weatherbury Farm too.  He manages\neverything.\"\n\n\"'Twill puzzle him to manage her, or any other man of his compass!\"\n\n\"I don't know about that.  She can't do without him, and knowing it\nwell he's pretty independent.  And she've a few soft corners to her\nmind, though I've never been able to get into one, the devil's in't!\"\n\n\"Ah, baily, she's a notch above you, and you must own it: a higher\nclass of animal--a finer tissue.  However, stick to me, and neither\nthis haughty goddess, dashing piece of womanhood, Juno-wife of mine\n(Juno was a goddess, you know), nor anybody else shall hurt you.  But\nall this wants looking into, I perceive.  What with one thing and\nanother, I see that my work is well cut out for me.\"\n\n\nV\n\n\n\"How do I look to-night, Liddy?\" said Bathsheba, giving a final\nadjustment to her dress before leaving the glass.\n\n\"I never saw you look so well before.  Yes--I'll tell you when you\nlooked like it--that night, a year and a half ago, when you came in\nso wildlike, and scolded us for making remarks about you and Mr.\nTroy.\"\n\n\"Everybody will think that I am setting myself to captivate Mr.\nBoldwood, I suppose,\" she murmured.  \"At least they'll say so.  Can't\nmy hair be brushed down a little flatter? I dread going--yet I dread\nthe risk of wounding him by staying away.\"\n\n\"Anyhow, ma'am, you can't well be dressed plainer than you are,\nunless you go in sackcloth at once.  'Tis your excitement is what\nmakes you look so noticeable to-night.\"\n\n\"I don't know what's the matter, I feel wretched at one time, and\nbuoyant at another.  I wish I could have continued quite alone as I\nhave been for the last year or so, with no hopes and no fears, and\nno pleasure and no grief.\"\n\n\"Now just suppose Mr. Boldwood should ask you--only just suppose\nit--to run away with him, what would you do, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Liddy--none of that,\" said Bathsheba, gravely.  \"Mind, I won't hear\njoking on any such matter.  Do you hear?\"\n\n\"I beg pardon, ma'am.  But knowing what rum things we women be, I\njust said--however, I won't speak of it again.\"\n\n\"No marrying for me yet for many a year; if ever, 'twill be for\nreasons very, very different from those you think, or others will\nbelieve!  Now get my cloak, for it is time to go.\"\n\n\nVI\n\n\n\"Oak,\" said Boldwood, \"before you go I want to mention what has been\npassing in my mind lately--that little arrangement we made about\nyour share in the farm I mean.  That share is small, too small,\nconsidering how little I attend to business now, and how much time\nand thought you give to it.  Well, since the world is brightening\nfor me, I want to show my sense of it by increasing your proportion\nin the partnership.  I'll make a memorandum of the arrangement which\nstruck me as likely to be convenient, for I haven't time to talk\nabout it now; and then we'll discuss it at our leisure.  My intention\nis ultimately to retire from the management altogether, and until you\ncan take all the expenditure upon your shoulders, I'll be a sleeping\npartner in the stock.  Then, if I marry her--and I hope--I feel I\nshall, why--\"\n\n\"Pray don't speak of it, sir,\" said Oak, hastily.  \"We don't know\nwhat may happen.  So many upsets may befall 'ee.  There's many a\nslip, as they say--and I would advise you--I know you'll pardon me\nthis once--not to be TOO SURE.\"\n\n\"I know, I know.  But the feeling I have about increasing your share\nis on account of what I know of you.  Oak, I have learnt a little\nabout your secret: your interest in her is more than that of bailiff\nfor an employer.  But you have behaved like a man, and I, as a sort\nof successful rival--successful partly through your goodness of\nheart--should like definitely to show my sense of your friendship\nunder what must have been a great pain to you.\"\n\n\"O that's not necessary, thank 'ee,\" said Oak, hurriedly. \"I must get\nused to such as that; other men have, and so shall I.\"\n\nOak then left him.  He was uneasy on Boldwood's account, for he saw\nanew that this constant passion of the farmer made him not the man\nhe once had been.\n\nAs Boldwood continued awhile in his room alone--ready and dressed to\nreceive his company--the mood of anxiety about his appearance seemed\nto pass away, and to be succeeded by a deep solemnity.  He looked out\nof the window, and regarded the dim outline of the trees upon the\nsky, and the twilight deepening to darkness.\n\nThen he went to a locked closet, and took from a locked drawer\ntherein a small circular case the size of a pillbox, and was about to\nput it into his pocket.  But he lingered to open the cover and take\na momentary glance inside.  It contained a woman's finger-ring, set\nall the way round with small diamonds, and from its appearance had\nevidently been recently purchased.  Boldwood's eyes dwelt upon its\nmany sparkles a long time, though that its material aspect concerned\nhim little was plain from his manner and mien, which were those of\na mind following out the presumed thread of that jewel's future\nhistory.\n\nThe noise of wheels at the front of the house became audible.\nBoldwood closed the box, stowed it away carefully in his pocket, and\nwent out upon the landing.  The old man who was his indoor factotum\ncame at the same moment to the foot of the stairs.\n\n\"They be coming, sir--lots of 'em--a-foot and a-driving!\"\n\n\"I was coming down this moment.  Those wheels I heard--is it Mrs.\nTroy?\"\n\n\"No, sir--'tis not she yet.\"\n\nA reserved and sombre expression had returned to Boldwood's face\nagain, but it poorly cloaked his feelings when he pronounced\nBathsheba's name; and his feverish anxiety continued to show its\nexistence by a galloping motion of his fingers upon the side of\nhis thigh as he went down the stairs.\n\n\nVII\n\n\n\"How does this cover me?\" said Troy to Pennyways.  \"Nobody would\nrecognize me now, I'm sure.\"\n\nHe was buttoning on a heavy grey overcoat of Noachian cut, with cape\nand high collar, the latter being erect and rigid, like a girdling\nwall, and nearly reaching to the verge of a travelling cap which was\npulled down over his ears.\n\nPennyways snuffed the candle, and then looked up and deliberately\ninspected Troy.\n\n\"You've made up your mind to go then?\" he said.\n\n\"Made up my mind?  Yes; of course I have.\"\n\n\"Why not write to her?  'Tis a very queer corner that you have got\ninto, sergeant.  You see all these things will come to light if you\ngo back, and they won't sound well at all.  Faith, if I was you I'd\neven bide as you be--a single man of the name of Francis.  A good\nwife is good, but the best wife is not so good as no wife at all.\nNow that's my outspoke mind, and I've been called a long-headed\nfeller here and there.\"\n\n\"All nonsense!\" said Troy, angrily.  \"There she is with plenty of\nmoney, and a house and farm, and horses, and comfort, and here am I\nliving from hand to mouth--a needy adventurer.  Besides, it is no use\ntalking now; it is too late, and I am glad of it; I've been seen and\nrecognized here this very afternoon.  I should have gone back to her\nthe day after the fair, if it hadn't been for you talking about the\nlaw, and rubbish about getting a separation; and I don't put it off\nany longer.  What the deuce put it into my head to run away at all, I\ncan't think!  Humbugging sentiment--that's what it was.  But what man\non earth was to know that his wife would be in such a hurry to get\nrid of his name!\"\n\n\"I should have known it.  She's bad enough for anything.\"\n\n\"Pennyways, mind who you are talking to.\"\n\n\"Well, sergeant, all I say is this, that if I were you I'd go abroad\nagain where I came from--'tisn't too late to do it now.  I wouldn't\nstir up the business and get a bad name for the sake of living with\nher--for all that about your play-acting is sure to come out, you\nknow, although you think otherwise.  My eyes and limbs, there'll\nbe a racket if you go back just now--in the middle of Boldwood's\nChristmasing!\"\n\n\"H'm, yes.  I expect I shall not be a very welcome guest if he has\nher there,\" said the sergeant, with a slight laugh.  \"A sort of\nAlonzo the Brave; and when I go in the guests will sit in silence and\nfear, and all laughter and pleasure will be hushed, and the lights in\nthe chamber burn blue, and the worms--Ugh, horrible!--Ring for some\nmore brandy, Pennyways, I felt an awful shudder just then!  Well,\nwhat is there besides?  A stick--I must have a walking-stick.\"\n\nPennyways now felt himself to be in something of a difficulty, for\nshould Bathsheba and Troy become reconciled it would be necessary\nto regain her good opinion if he would secure the patronage of her\nhusband.  \"I sometimes think she likes you yet, and is a good woman\nat bottom,\" he said, as a saving sentence.  \"But there's no telling\nto a certainty from a body's outside.  Well, you'll do as you like\nabout going, of course, sergeant, and as for me, I'll do as you tell\nme.\"\n\n\"Now, let me see what the time is,\" said Troy, after emptying his\nglass in one draught as he stood.  \"Half-past six o'clock.  I shall\nnot hurry along the road, and shall be there then before nine.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII\n\n\nCONCURRITUR--HORAE MOMENTO\n\n\nOutside the front of Boldwood's house a group of men stood in the\ndark, with their faces towards the door, which occasionally opened\nand closed for the passage of some guest or servant, when a golden\nrod of light would stripe the ground for the moment and vanish again,\nleaving nothing outside but the glowworm shine of the pale lamp amid\nthe evergreens over the door.\n\n\"He was seen in Casterbridge this afternoon--so the boy said,\" one of\nthem remarked in a whisper.  \"And I for one believe it.  His body was\nnever found, you know.\"\n\n\"'Tis a strange story,\" said the next.  \"You may depend upon't that\nshe knows nothing about it.\"\n\n\"Not a word.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he don't mean that she shall,\" said another man.\n\n\"If he's alive and here in the neighbourhood, he means mischief,\"\nsaid the first.  \"Poor young thing: I do pity her, if 'tis true.\nHe'll drag her to the dogs.\"\n\n\"O no; he'll settle down quiet enough,\" said one disposed to take a\nmore hopeful view of the case.\n\n\"What a fool she must have been ever to have had anything to do with\nthe man!  She is so self-willed and independent too, that one is more\nminded to say it serves her right than pity her.\"\n\n\"No, no.  I don't hold with 'ee there.  She was no otherwise than a\ngirl mind, and how could she tell what the man was made of?  If 'tis\nreally true, 'tis too hard a punishment, and more than she ought to\nhae.--Hullo, who's that?\"  This was to some footsteps that were heard\napproaching.\n\n\"William Smallbury,\" said a dim figure in the shades, coming up and\njoining them.  \"Dark as a hedge, to-night, isn't it? I all but missed\nthe plank over the river ath'art there in the bottom--never did such\na thing before in my life.  Be ye any of Boldwood's workfolk?\"  He\npeered into their faces.\n\n\"Yes--all o' us.  We met here a few minutes ago.\"\n\n\"Oh, I hear now--that's Sam Samway: thought I knowed the voice, too.\nGoing in?\"\n\n\"Presently.  But I say, William,\" Samway whispered, \"have ye heard\nthis strange tale?\"\n\n\"What--that about Sergeant Troy being seen, d'ye mean, souls?\" said\nSmallbury, also lowering his voice.\n\n\"Ay: in Casterbridge.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have.  Laban Tall named a hint of it to me but now--but I\ndon't think it.  Hark, here Laban comes himself, 'a b'lieve.\"  A\nfootstep drew near.\n\n\"Laban?\"\n\n\"Yes, 'tis I,\" said Tall.\n\n\"Have ye heard any more about that?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Tall, joining the group.  \"And I'm inclined to think we'd\nbetter keep quiet.  If so be 'tis not true, 'twill flurry her, and do\nher much harm to repeat it; and if so be 'tis true, 'twill do no good\nto forestall her time o' trouble.  God send that it mid be a lie, for\nthough Henery Fray and some of 'em do speak against her, she's never\nbeen anything but fair to me.  She's hot and hasty, but she's a brave\ngirl who'll never tell a lie however much the truth may harm her, and\nI've no cause to wish her evil.\"\n\n\"She never do tell women's little lies, that's true; and 'tis a thing\nthat can be said of very few.  Ay, all the harm she thinks she says\nto yer face: there's nothing underhand wi' her.\"\n\nThey stood silent then, every man busied with his own thoughts,\nduring which interval sounds of merriment could be heard within.\nThen the front door again opened, the rays streamed out, the\nwell-known form of Boldwood was seen in the rectangular area of\nlight, the door closed, and Boldwood walked slowly down the path.\n\n\"'Tis master,\" one of the men whispered, as he neared them. \"We'd\nbetter stand quiet--he'll go in again directly.  He would think it\nunseemly o' us to be loitering here.\"\n\nBoldwood came on, and passed by the men without seeing them, they\nbeing under the bushes on the grass.  He paused, leant over the gate,\nand breathed a long breath.  They heard low words come from him.\n\n\"I hope to God she'll come, or this night will be nothing but misery\nto me!  Oh my darling, my darling, why do you keep me in suspense\nlike this?\"\n\nHe said this to himself, and they all distinctly heard it.  Boldwood\nremained silent after that, and the noise from indoors was again\njust audible, until, a few minutes later, light wheels could be\ndistinguished coming down the hill.  They drew nearer, and ceased at\nthe gate.  Boldwood hastened back to the door, and opened it; and the\nlight shone upon Bathsheba coming up the path.\n\nBoldwood compressed his emotion to mere welcome: the men marked her\nlight laugh and apology as she met him: he took her into the house;\nand the door closed again.\n\n\"Gracious heaven, I didn't know it was like that with him!\" said one\nof the men.  \"I thought that fancy of his was over long ago.\"\n\n\"You don't know much of master, if you thought that,\" said Samway.\n\n\"I wouldn't he should know we heard what 'a said for the world,\"\nremarked a third.\n\n\"I wish we had told of the report at once,\" the first uneasily\ncontinued.  \"More harm may come of this than we know of.  Poor Mr.\nBoldwood, it will be hard upon en.  I wish Troy was in--Well, God\nforgive me for such a wish!  A scoundrel to play a poor wife such\ntricks.  Nothing has prospered in Weatherbury since he came here.\nAnd now I've no heart to go in.  Let's look into Warren's for a few\nminutes first, shall us, neighbours?\"\n\nSamway, Tall, and Smallbury agreed to go to Warren's, and went out at\nthe gate, the remaining ones entering the house.  The three soon drew\nnear the malt-house, approaching it from the adjoining orchard, and\nnot by way of the street.  The pane of glass was illuminated as\nusual.  Smallbury was a little in advance of the rest when, pausing,\nhe turned suddenly to his companions and said, \"Hist!  See there.\"\n\nThe light from the pane was now perceived to be shining not upon the\nivied wall as usual, but upon some object close to the glass.  It was\na human face.\n\n\"Let's come closer,\" whispered Samway; and they approached on tiptoe.\nThere was no disbelieving the report any longer.  Troy's face was\nalmost close to the pane, and he was looking in.  Not only was he\nlooking in, but he appeared to have been arrested by a conversation\nwhich was in progress in the malt-house, the voices of the\ninterlocutors being those of Oak and the maltster.\n\n\"The spree is all in her honour, isn't it--hey?\" said the old man.\n\"Although he made believe 'tis only keeping up o' Christmas?\"\n\n\"I cannot say,\" replied Oak.\n\n\"Oh 'tis true enough, faith.  I cannot understand Farmer Boldwood\nbeing such a fool at his time of life as to ho and hanker after this\nwoman in the way 'a do, and she not care a bit about en.\"\n\nThe men, after recognizing Troy's features, withdrew across\nthe orchard as quietly as they had come.  The air was big with\nBathsheba's fortunes to-night: every word everywhere concerned her.\nWhen they were quite out of earshot all by one instinct paused.\n\n\"It gave me quite a turn--his face,\" said Tall, breathing.\n\n\"And so it did me,\" said Samway.  \"What's to be done?\"\n\n\"I don't see that 'tis any business of ours,\" Smallbury murmured\ndubiously.\n\n\"But it is!  'Tis a thing which is everybody's business,\" said\nSamway.  \"We know very well that master's on a wrong tack, and that\nshe's quite in the dark, and we should let 'em know at once.  Laban,\nyou know her best--you'd better go and ask to speak to her.\"\n\n\"I bain't fit for any such thing,\" said Laban, nervously.  \"I should\nthink William ought to do it if anybody.  He's oldest.\"\n\n\"I shall have nothing to do with it,\" said Smallbury.  \"'Tis a\nticklish business altogether.  Why, he'll go on to her himself in a\nfew minutes, ye'll see.\"\n\n\"We don't know that he will.  Come, Laban.\"\n\n\"Very well, if I must I must, I suppose,\" Tall reluctantly answered.\n\"What must I say?\"\n\n\"Just ask to see master.\"\n\n\"Oh no; I shan't speak to Mr. Boldwood.  If I tell anybody, 'twill be\nmistress.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Samway.\n\nLaban then went to the door.  When he opened it the hum of bustle\nrolled out as a wave upon a still strand--the assemblage being\nimmediately inside the hall--and was deadened to a murmur as he\nclosed it again.  Each man waited intently, and looked around at\nthe dark tree tops gently rocking against the sky and occasionally\nshivering in a slight wind, as if he took interest in the scene,\nwhich neither did.  One of them began walking up and down, and then\ncame to where he started from and stopped again, with a sense that\nwalking was a thing not worth doing now.\n\n\"I should think Laban must have seen mistress by this time,\" said\nSmallbury, breaking the silence.  \"Perhaps she won't come and speak\nto him.\"\n\nThe door opened.  Tall appeared, and joined them.\n\n\"Well?\" said both.\n\n\"I didn't like to ask for her after all,\" Laban faltered out.  \"They\nwere all in such a stir, trying to put a little spirit into the\nparty.  Somehow the fun seems to hang fire, though everything's there\nthat a heart can desire, and I couldn't for my soul interfere and\nthrow damp upon it--if 'twas to save my life, I couldn't!\"\n\n\"I suppose we had better all go in together,\" said Samway, gloomily.\n\"Perhaps I may have a chance of saying a word to master.\"\n\nSo the men entered the hall, which was the room selected and arranged\nfor the gathering because of its size.  The younger men and maids\nwere at last just beginning to dance.  Bathsheba had been perplexed\nhow to act, for she was not much more than a slim young maid herself,\nand the weight of stateliness sat heavy upon her.  Sometimes she\nthought she ought not to have come under any circumstances; then she\nconsidered what cold unkindness that would have been, and finally\nresolved upon the middle course of staying for about an hour only,\nand gliding off unobserved, having from the first made up her mind\nthat she could on no account dance, sing, or take any active part in\nthe proceedings.\n\nHer allotted hour having been passed in chatting and looking on,\nBathsheba told Liddy not to hurry herself, and went to the small\nparlour to prepare for departure, which, like the hall, was decorated\nwith holly and ivy, and well lighted up.\n\nNobody was in the room, but she had hardly been there a moment when\nthe master of the house entered.\n\n\"Mrs. Troy--you are not going?\" he said.  \"We've hardly begun!\"\n\n\"If you'll excuse me, I should like to go now.\"  Her manner was\nrestive, for she remembered her promise, and imagined what he was\nabout to say.  \"But as it is not late,\" she added, \"I can walk home,\nand leave my man and Liddy to come when they choose.\"\n\n\"I've been trying to get an opportunity of speaking to you,\" said\nBoldwood.  \"You know perhaps what I long to say?\"\n\nBathsheba silently looked on the floor.\n\n\"You do give it?\" he said, eagerly.\n\n\"What?\" she whispered.\n\n\"Now, that's evasion!  Why, the promise.  I don't want to intrude\nupon you at all, or to let it become known to anybody.  But do give\nyour word!  A mere business compact, you know, between two people who\nare beyond the influence of passion.\"  Boldwood knew how false this\npicture was as regarded himself; but he had proved that it was the\nonly tone in which she would allow him to approach her.  \"A promise\nto marry me at the end of five years and three-quarters.  You owe it\nto me!\"\n\n\"I feel that I do,\" said Bathsheba; \"that is, if you demand it.  But\nI am a changed woman--an unhappy woman--and not--not--\"\n\n\"You are still a very beautiful woman,\" said Boldwood.  Honesty and\npure conviction suggested the remark, unaccompanied by any perception\nthat it might have been adopted by blunt flattery to soothe and win\nher.\n\nHowever, it had not much effect now, for she said, in a passionless\nmurmur which was in itself a proof of her words: \"I have no feeling\nin the matter at all.  And I don't at all know what is right to do\nin my difficult position, and I have nobody to advise me.  But I\ngive my promise, if I must.  I give it as the rendering of a debt,\nconditionally, of course, on my being a widow.\"\n\n\"You'll marry me between five and six years hence?\"\n\n\"Don't press me too hard.  I'll marry nobody else.\"\n\n\"But surely you will name the time, or there's nothing in the promise\nat all?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know, pray let me go!\" she said, her bosom beginning to\nrise.  \"I am afraid what to do! I want to be just to you, and to be\nthat seems to be wronging myself, and perhaps it is breaking the\ncommandments.  There is considerable doubt of his death, and then it\nis dreadful; let me ask a solicitor, Mr. Boldwood, if I ought or no!\"\n\n\"Say the words, dear one, and the subject shall be dismissed;\na blissful loving intimacy of six years, and then marriage--O\nBathsheba, say them!\" he begged in a husky voice, unable to sustain\nthe forms of mere friendship any longer.  \"Promise yourself to me; I\ndeserve it, indeed I do, for I have loved you more than anybody in\nthe world!  And if I said hasty words and showed uncalled-for heat\nof manner towards you, believe me, dear, I did not mean to distress\nyou; I was in agony, Bathsheba, and I did not know what I said.  You\nwouldn't let a dog suffer what I have suffered, could you but know\nit!  Sometimes I shrink from your knowing what I have felt for you,\nand sometimes I am distressed that all of it you never will know.  Be\ngracious, and give up a little to me, when I would give up my life\nfor you!\"\n\nThe trimmings of her dress, as they quivered against the light,\nshowed how agitated she was, and at last she burst out crying.  \"And\nyou'll not--press me--about anything more--if I say in five or six\nyears?\" she sobbed, when she had power to frame the words.\n\n\"Yes, then I'll leave it to time.\"\n\nShe waited a moment.  \"Very well.  I'll marry you in six years from\nthis day, if we both live,\" she said solemnly.\n\n\"And you'll take this as a token from me.\"\n\nBoldwood had come close to her side, and now he clasped one of her\nhands in both his own, and lifted it to his breast.\n\n\"What is it?  Oh I cannot wear a ring!\" she exclaimed, on seeing\nwhat he held; \"besides, I wouldn't have a soul know that it's an\nengagement!  Perhaps it is improper?  Besides, we are not engaged in\nthe usual sense, are we?  Don't insist, Mr. Boldwood--don't!\"  In her\ntrouble at not being able to get her hand away from him at once, she\nstamped passionately on the floor with one foot, and tears crowded to\nher eyes again.\n\n\"It means simply a pledge--no sentiment--the seal of a practical\ncompact,\" he said more quietly, but still retaining her hand in\nhis firm grasp.  \"Come, now!\" And Boldwood slipped the ring on her\nfinger.\n\n\"I cannot wear it,\" she said, weeping as if her heart would break.\n\"You frighten me, almost.  So wild a scheme!  Please let me go home!\"\n\n\"Only to-night: wear it just to-night, to please me!\"\n\nBathsheba sat down in a chair, and buried her face in her\nhandkerchief, though Boldwood kept her hand yet.  At length she\nsaid, in a sort of hopeless whisper--\n\n\"Very well, then, I will to-night, if you wish it so earnestly.  Now\nloosen my hand; I will, indeed I will wear it to-night.\"\n\n\"And it shall be the beginning of a pleasant secret courtship of six\nyears, with a wedding at the end?\"\n\n\"It must be, I suppose, since you will have it so!\" she said, fairly\nbeaten into non-resistance.\n\nBoldwood pressed her hand, and allowed it to drop in her lap.  \"I am\nhappy now,\" he said.  \"God bless you!\"\n\nHe left the room, and when he thought she might be sufficiently\ncomposed sent one of the maids to her.  Bathsheba cloaked the effects\nof the late scene as she best could, followed the girl, and in a few\nmoments came downstairs with her hat and cloak on, ready to go.  To\nget to the door it was necessary to pass through the hall, and before\ndoing so she paused on the bottom of the staircase which descended\ninto one corner, to take a last look at the gathering.\n\nThere was no music or dancing in progress just now.  At the lower\nend, which had been arranged for the work-folk specially, a group\nconversed in whispers, and with clouded looks.  Boldwood was standing\nby the fireplace, and he, too, though so absorbed in visions arising\nfrom her promise that he scarcely saw anything, seemed at that moment\nto have observed their peculiar manner, and their looks askance.\n\n\"What is it you are in doubt about, men?\" he said.\n\nOne of them turned and replied uneasily: \"It was something Laban\nheard of, that's all, sir.\"\n\n\"News?  Anybody married or engaged, born or dead?\" inquired the\nfarmer, gaily.  \"Tell it to us, Tall.  One would think from your\nlooks and mysterious ways that it was something very dreadful\nindeed.\"\n\n\"Oh no, sir, nobody is dead,\" said Tall.\n\n\"I wish somebody was,\" said Samway, in a whisper.\n\n\"What do you say, Samway?\" asked Boldwood, somewhat sharply.  \"If you\nhave anything to say, speak out; if not, get up another dance.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Troy has come downstairs,\" said Samway to Tall.  \"If you want\nto tell her, you had better do it now.\"\n\n\"Do you know what they mean?\" the farmer asked Bathsheba, across the\nroom.\n\n\"I don't in the least,\" said Bathsheba.\n\nThere was a smart rapping at the door.  One of the men opened it\ninstantly, and went outside.\n\n\"Mrs. Troy is wanted,\" he said, on returning.\n\n\"Quite ready,\" said Bathsheba.  \"Though I didn't tell them to send.\"\n\n\"It is a stranger, ma'am,\" said the man by the door.\n\n\"A stranger?\" she said.\n\n\"Ask him to come in,\" said Boldwood.\n\nThe message was given, and Troy, wrapped up to his eyes as we have\nseen him, stood in the doorway.\n\nThere was an unearthly silence, all looking towards the newcomer.\nThose who had just learnt that he was in the neighbourhood recognized\nhim instantly; those who did not were perplexed.  Nobody noted\nBathsheba.  She was leaning on the stairs.  Her brow had heavily\ncontracted; her whole face was pallid, her lips apart, her eyes\nrigidly staring at their visitor.\n\nBoldwood was among those who did not notice that he was Troy.  \"Come\nin, come in!\" he repeated, cheerfully, \"and drain a Christmas beaker\nwith us, stranger!\"\n\nTroy next advanced into the middle of the room, took off his cap,\nturned down his coat-collar, and looked Boldwood in the face.  Even\nthen Boldwood did not recognize that the impersonator of Heaven's\npersistent irony towards him, who had once before broken in upon his\nbliss, scourged him, and snatched his delight away, had come to do\nthese things a second time.  Troy began to laugh a mechanical laugh:\nBoldwood recognized him now.\n\nTroy turned to Bathsheba.  The poor girl's wretchedness at this time\nwas beyond all fancy or narration.  She had sunk down on the lowest\nstair; and there she sat, her mouth blue and dry, and her dark eyes\nfixed vacantly upon him, as if she wondered whether it were not all\na terrible illusion.\n\nThen Troy spoke.  \"Bathsheba, I come here for you!\"\n\nShe made no reply.\n\n\"Come home with me: come!\"\n\nBathsheba moved her feet a little, but did not rise.  Troy went\nacross to her.\n\n\"Come, madam, do you hear what I say?\" he said, peremptorily.\n\nA strange voice came from the fireplace--a voice sounding far off\nand confined, as if from a dungeon.  Hardly a soul in the assembly\nrecognized the thin tones to be those of Boldwood.  Sudden despair\nhad transformed him.\n\n\"Bathsheba, go with your husband!\"\n\nNevertheless, she did not move.  The truth was that Bathsheba was\nbeyond the pale of activity--and yet not in a swoon.  She was in a\nstate of mental _gutta serena_; her mind was for the minute totally\ndeprived of light at the same time no obscuration was apparent from\nwithout.\n\nTroy stretched out his hand to pull her her towards him, when she\nquickly shrank back.  This visible dread of him seemed to irritate\nTroy, and he seized her arm and pulled it sharply.  Whether his grasp\npinched her, or whether his mere touch was the cause, was never\nknown, but at the moment of his seizure she writhed, and gave a\nquick, low scream.\n\nThe scream had been heard but a few seconds when it was followed by\nsudden deafening report that echoed through the room and stupefied\nthem all.  The oak partition shook with the concussion, and the place\nwas filled with grey smoke.\n\nIn bewilderment they turned their eyes to Boldwood.  At his back,\nas stood before the fireplace, was a gun-rack, as is usual in\nfarmhouses, constructed to hold two guns.  When Bathsheba had cried\nout in her husband's grasp, Boldwood's face of gnashing despair had\nchanged.  The veins had swollen, and a frenzied look had gleamed in\nhis eye.  He had turned quickly, taken one of the guns, cocked it,\nand at once discharged it at Troy.\n\nTroy fell.  The distance apart of the two men was so small that\nthe charge of shot did not spread in the least, but passed like a\nbullet into his body.  He uttered a long guttural sigh--there was\na contraction--an extension--then his muscles relaxed, and he lay\nstill.\n\nBoldwood was seen through the smoke to be now again engaged with the\ngun.  It was double-barrelled, and he had, meanwhile, in some way\nfastened his hand-kerchief to the trigger, and with his foot on the\nother end was in the act of turning the second barrel upon himself.\nSamway his man was the first to see this, and in the midst of the\ngeneral horror darted up to him.  Boldwood had already twitched\nthe handkerchief, and the gun exploded a second time, sending its\ncontents, by a timely blow from Samway, into the beam which crossed\nthe ceiling.\n\n\"Well, it makes no difference!\" Boldwood gasped.  \"There is another\nway for me to die.\"\n\nThen he broke from Samway, crossed the room to Bathsheba, and kissed\nher hand.  He put on his hat, opened the door, and went into the\ndarkness, nobody thinking of preventing him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV\n\n\nAFTER THE SHOCK\n\n\nBoldwood passed into the high road and turned in the direction of\nCasterbridge.  Here he walked at an even, steady pace over Yalbury\nHill, along the dead level beyond, mounted Mellstock Hill, and\nbetween eleven and twelve o'clock crossed the Moor into the town.\nThe streets were nearly deserted now, and the waving lamp-flames only\nlighted up rows of grey shop-shutters, and strips of white paving\nupon which his step echoed as his passed along.  He turned to the\nright, and halted before an archway of heavy stonework, which was\nclosed by an iron studded pair of doors.  This was the entrance\nto the gaol, and over it a lamp was fixed, the light enabling the\nwretched traveller to find a bell-pull.\n\nThe small wicket at last opened, and a porter appeared.  Boldwood\nstepped forward, and said something in a low tone, when, after a\ndelay, another man came.  Boldwood entered, and the door was closed\nbehind him, and he walked the world no more.\n\nLong before this time Weatherbury had been thoroughly aroused, and\nthe wild deed which had terminated Boldwood's merrymaking became\nknown to all.  Of those out of the house Oak was one of the first to\nhear of the catastrophe, and when he entered the room, which was\nabout five minutes after Boldwood's exit, the scene was terrible.\nAll the female guests were huddled aghast against the walls like\nsheep in a storm, and the men were bewildered as to what to do.  As\nfor Bathsheba, she had changed.  She was sitting on the floor beside\nthe body of Troy, his head pillowed in her lap, where she had herself\nlifted it.  With one hand she held her handkerchief to his breast and\ncovered the wound, though scarcely a single drop of blood had flowed,\nand with the other she tightly clasped one of his.  The household\nconvulsion had made her herself again.  The temporary coma had\nceased, and activity had come with the necessity for it.  Deeds of\nendurance, which seem ordinary in philosophy, are rare in conduct,\nand Bathsheba was astonishing all around her now, for her philosophy\nwas her conduct, and she seldom thought practicable what she did\nnot practise.  She was of the stuff of which great men's mothers\nare made.  She was indispensable to high generation, hated at tea\nparties, feared in shops, and loved at crises.  Troy recumbent in\nhis wife's lap formed now the sole spectacle in the middle of the\nspacious room.\n\n\"Gabriel,\" she said, automatically, when he entered, turning up a\nface of which only the well-known lines remained to tell him it\nwas hers, all else in the picture having faded quite.  \"Ride to\nCasterbridge instantly for a surgeon.  It is, I believe, useless,\nbut go.  Mr. Boldwood has shot my husband.\"\n\nHer statement of the fact in such quiet and simple words came with\nmore force than a tragic declamation, and had somewhat the effect of\nsetting the distorted images in each mind present into proper focus.\nOak, almost before he had comprehended anything beyond the briefest\nabstract of the event, hurried out of the room, saddled a horse and\nrode away.  Not till he had ridden more than a mile did it occur to\nhim that he would have done better by sending some other man on this\nerrand, remaining himself in the house.  What had become of Boldwood?\nHe should have been looked after.  Was he mad--had there been a\nquarrel?  Then how had Troy got there?  Where had he come from?  How\ndid this remarkable reappearance effect itself when he was supposed\nby many to be at the bottom of the sea?  Oak had in some slight\nmeasure been prepared for the presence of Troy by hearing a rumour\nof his return just before entering Boldwood's house; but before he\nhad weighed that information, this fatal event had been superimposed.\nHowever, it was too late now to think of sending another messenger,\nand he rode on, in the excitement of these self-inquiries\nnot discerning, when about three miles from Casterbridge, a\nsquare-figured pedestrian passing along under the dark hedge in the\nsame direction as his own.\n\nThe miles necessary to be traversed, and other hindrances incidental\nto the lateness of the hour and the darkness of the night, delayed\nthe arrival of Mr. Aldritch, the surgeon; and more than three hours\npassed between the time at which the shot was fired and that of his\nentering the house.  Oak was additionally detained in Casterbridge\nthrough having to give notice to the authorities of what had\nhappened; and he then found that Boldwood had also entered the town,\nand delivered himself up.\n\nIn the meantime the surgeon, having hastened into the hall at\nBoldwood's, found it in darkness and quite deserted.  He went on to\nthe back of the house, where he discovered in the kitchen an old man,\nof whom he made inquiries.\n\n\"She's had him took away to her own house, sir,\" said his informant.\n\n\"Who has?\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Mrs. Troy.  'A was quite dead, sir.\"\n\nThis was astonishing information.  \"She had no right to do that,\"\nsaid the doctor.  \"There will have to be an inquest, and she should\nhave waited to know what to do.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; it was hinted to her that she had better wait till the law\nwas known.  But she said law was nothing to her, and she wouldn't let\nher dear husband's corpse bide neglected for folks to stare at for\nall the crowners in England.\"\n\nMr. Aldritch drove at once back again up the hill to Bathsheba's.\nThe first person he met was poor Liddy, who seemed literally to have\ndwindled smaller in these few latter hours.  \"What has been done?\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"I don't know, sir,\" said Liddy, with suspended breath.  \"My mistress\nhas done it all.\"\n\n\"Where is she?\"\n\n\"Upstairs with him, sir.  When he was brought home and taken\nupstairs, she said she wanted no further help from the men.  And then\nshe called me, and made me fill the bath, and after that told me I\nhad better go and lie down because I looked so ill.  Then she locked\nherself into the room alone with him, and would not let a nurse come\nin, or anybody at all.  But I thought I'd wait in the next room in\ncase she should want me.  I heard her moving about inside for more\nthan an hour, but she only came out once, and that was for more\ncandles, because hers had burnt down into the socket.  She said we\nwere to let her know when you or Mr. Thirdly came, sir.\"\n\nOak entered with the parson at this moment, and they all went\nupstairs together, preceded by Liddy Smallbury.  Everything was\nsilent as the grave when they paused on the landing.  Liddy knocked,\nand Bathsheba's dress was heard rustling across the room: the key\nturned in the lock, and she opened the door.  Her looks were calm and\nnearly rigid, like a slightly animated bust of Melpomene.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Aldritch, you have come at last,\" she murmured from her lips\nmerely, and threw back the door.  \"Ah, and Mr. Thirdly.  Well, all is\ndone, and anybody in the world may see him now.\"  She then passed by\nhim, crossed the landing, and entered another room.\n\nLooking into the chamber of death she had vacated they saw by the\nlight of the candles which were on the drawers a tall straight\nshape lying at the further end of the bedroom, wrapped in white.\nEverything around was quite orderly.  The doctor went in, and after a\nfew minutes returned to the landing again, where Oak and the parson\nstill waited.\n\n\"It is all done, indeed, as she says,\" remarked Mr. Aldritch, in a\nsubdued voice.  \"The body has been undressed and properly laid out in\ngrave clothes.  Gracious Heaven--this mere girl!  She must have the\nnerve of a stoic!\"\n\n\"The heart of a wife merely,\" floated in a whisper about the ears\nof the three, and turning they saw Bathsheba in the midst of them.\nThen, as if at that instant to prove that her fortitude had been\nmore of will than of spontaneity, she silently sank down between\nthem and was a shapeless heap of drapery on the floor.  The simple\nconsciousness that superhuman strain was no longer required had at\nonce put a period to her power to continue it.\n\nThey took her away into a further room, and the medical attendance\nwhich had been useless in Troy's case was invaluable in Bathsheba's,\nwho fell into a series of fainting-fits that had a serious aspect\nfor a time.  The sufferer was got to bed, and Oak, finding from the\nbulletins that nothing really dreadful was to be apprehended on her\nscore, left the house.  Liddy kept watch in Bathsheba's chamber,\nwhere she heard her mistress, moaning in whispers through the dull\nslow hours of that wretched night: \"Oh it is my fault--how can I\nlive!  O Heaven, how can I live!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV\n\n\nTHE MARCH FOLLOWING--\"BATHSHEBA BOLDWOOD\"\n\n\nWe pass rapidly on into the month of March, to a breezy day without\nsunshine, frost, or dew.  On Yalbury Hill, about midway between\nWeatherbury and Casterbridge, where the turnpike road passes over\nthe crest, a numerous concourse of people had gathered, the eyes of\nthe greater number being frequently stretched afar in a northerly\ndirection.  The groups consisted of a throng of idlers, a party of\njavelin-men, and two trumpeters, and in the midst were carriages, one\nof which contained the high sheriff.  With the idlers, many of whom\nhad mounted to the top of a cutting formed for the road, were several\nWeatherbury men and boys--among others Poorgrass, Coggan, and Cain\nBall.\n\nAt the end of half-an-hour a faint dust was seen in the expected\nquarter, and shortly after a travelling-carriage, bringing one of the\ntwo judges on the Western Circuit, came up the hill and halted on the\ntop.  The judge changed carriages whilst a flourish was blown by the\nbig-cheeked trumpeters, and a procession being formed of the vehicles\nand javelin-men, they all proceeded towards the town, excepting the\nWeatherbury men, who as soon as they had seen the judge move off\nreturned home again to their work.\n\n\"Joseph, I seed you squeezing close to the carriage,\" said Coggan, as\nthey walked.  \"Did ye notice my lord judge's face?\"\n\n\"I did,\" said Poorgrass.  \"I looked hard at en, as if I would read\nhis very soul; and there was mercy in his eyes--or to speak with the\nexact truth required of us at this solemn time, in the eye that was\ntowards me.\"\n\n\"Well, I hope for the best,\" said Coggan, \"though bad that must be.\nHowever, I shan't go to the trial, and I'd advise the rest of ye\nthat bain't wanted to bide away.  'Twill disturb his mind more than\nanything to see us there staring at him as if he were a show.\"\n\n\"The very thing I said this morning,\" observed Joseph, \"'Justice is\ncome to weigh him in the balances,' I said in my reflectious way,\n'and if he's found wanting, so be it unto him,' and a bystander said\n'Hear, hear!  A man who can talk like that ought to be heard.' But I\ndon't like dwelling upon it, for my few words are my few words, and\nnot much; though the speech of some men is rumoured abroad as though\nby nature formed for such.\"\n\n\"So 'tis, Joseph.  And now, neighbours, as I said, every man bide at\nhome.\"\n\nThe resolution was adhered to; and all waited anxiously for the news\nnext day.  Their suspense was diverted, however, by a discovery which\nwas made in the afternoon, throwing more light on Boldwood's conduct\nand condition than any details which had preceded it.\n\nThat he had been from the time of Greenhill Fair until the fatal\nChristmas Eve in excited and unusual moods was known to those who had\nbeen intimate with him; but nobody imagined that there had shown in\nhim unequivocal symptoms of the mental derangement which Bathsheba\nand Oak, alone of all others and at different times, had momentarily\nsuspected.  In a locked closet was now discovered an extraordinary\ncollection of articles.  There were several sets of ladies' dresses\nin the piece, of sundry expensive materials; silks and satins,\npoplins and velvets, all of colours which from Bathsheba's style of\ndress might have been judged to be her favourites.  There were two\nmuffs, sable and ermine.  Above all there was a case of jewellery,\ncontaining four heavy gold bracelets and several lockets and rings,\nall of fine quality and manufacture.  These things had been bought in\nBath and other towns from time to time, and brought home by stealth.\nThey were all carefully packed in paper, and each package was\nlabelled \"Bathsheba Boldwood,\" a date being subjoined six years in\nadvance in every instance.\n\nThese somewhat pathetic evidences of a mind crazed with care and love\nwere the subject of discourse in Warren's malt-house when Oak entered\nfrom Casterbridge with tidings of sentence. He came in the afternoon,\nand his face, as the kiln glow shone upon it, told the tale\nsufficiently well.  Boldwood, as every one supposed he would do, had\npleaded guilty, and had been sentenced to death.\n\nThe conviction that Boldwood had not been morally responsible for his\nlater acts now became general.  Facts elicited previous to the trial\nhad pointed strongly in the same direction, but they had not been of\nsufficient weight to lead to an order for an examination into the\nstate of Boldwood's mind.  It was astonishing, now that a presumption\nof insanity was raised, how many collateral circumstances were\nremembered to which a condition of mental disease seemed to afford\nthe only explanation--among others, the unprecedented neglect of his\ncorn stacks in the previous summer.\n\nA petition was addressed to the Home Secretary, advancing\nthe circumstances which appeared to justify a request for a\nreconsideration of the sentence.  It was not \"numerously signed\"\nby the inhabitants of Casterbridge, as is usual in such cases, for\nBoldwood had never made many friends over the counter.  The shops\nthought it very natural that a man who, by importing direct from\nthe producer, had daringly set aside the first great principle of\nprovincial existence, namely that God made country villages to supply\ncustomers to county towns, should have confused ideas about the\nDecalogue.  The prompters were a few merciful men who had perhaps too\nfeelingly considered the facts latterly unearthed, and the result was\nthat evidence was taken which it was hoped might remove the crime in\na moral point of view, out of the category of wilful murder, and lead\nit to be regarded as a sheer outcome of madness.\n\nThe upshot of the petition was waited for in Weatherbury with\nsolicitous interest.  The execution had been fixed for eight o'clock\non a Saturday morning about a fortnight after the sentence was\npassed, and up to Friday afternoon no answer had been received.  At\nthat time Gabriel came from Casterbridge Gaol, whither he had been\nto wish Boldwood good-bye, and turned down a by-street to avoid the\ntown.  When past the last house he heard a hammering, and lifting\nhis bowed head he looked back for a moment.  Over the chimneys he\ncould see the upper part of the gaol entrance, rich and glowing\nin the afternoon sun, and some moving figures were there.  They\nwere carpenters lifting a post into a vertical position within the\nparapet.  He withdrew his eyes quickly, and hastened on.\n\nIt was dark when he reached home, and half the village was out to\nmeet him.\n\n\"No tidings,\" Gabriel said, wearily.  \"And I'm afraid there's no\nhope.  I've been with him more than two hours.\"\n\n\"Do ye think he REALLY was out of his mind when he did it?\" said\nSmallbury.\n\n\"I can't honestly say that I do,\" Oak replied.  \"However, that we can\ntalk of another time.  Has there been any change in mistress this\nafternoon?\"\n\n\"None at all.\"\n\n\"Is she downstairs?\"\n\n\"No.  And getting on so nicely as she was too.  She's but very little\nbetter now again than she was at Christmas.  She keeps on asking\nif you be come, and if there's news, till one's wearied out wi'\nanswering her.  Shall I go and say you've come?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Oak.  \"There's a chance yet; but I couldn't stay in town\nany longer--after seeing him too.  So Laban--Laban is here, isn't\nhe?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Tall.\n\n\"What I've arranged is, that you shall ride to town the last thing\nto-night; leave here about nine, and wait a while there, getting home\nabout twelve.  If nothing has been received by eleven to-night, they\nsay there's no chance at all.\"\n\n\"I do so hope his life will be spared,\" said Liddy.  \"If it is not,\nshe'll go out of her mind too.  Poor thing; her sufferings have been\ndreadful; she deserves anybody's pity.\"\n\n\"Is she altered much?\" said Coggan.\n\n\"If you haven't seen poor mistress since Christmas, you wouldn't know\nher,\" said Liddy.  \"Her eyes are so miserable that she's not the same\nwoman.  Only two years ago she was a romping girl, and now she's\nthis!\"\n\nLaban departed as directed, and at eleven o'clock that night several\nof the villagers strolled along the road to Casterbridge and awaited\nhis arrival--among them Oak, and nearly all the rest of Bathsheba's\nmen.  Gabriel's anxiety was great that Boldwood might be saved, even\nthough in his conscience he felt that he ought to die; for there had\nbeen qualities in the farmer which Oak loved.  At last, when they all\nwere weary the tramp of a horse was heard in the distance--\n\n\n     First dead, as if on turf it trode,\n     Then, clattering on the village road\n     In other pace than forth he yode.\n\n\n\"We shall soon know now, one way or other.\" said Coggan, and they all\nstepped down from the bank on which they had been standing into the\nroad, and the rider pranced into the midst of them.\n\n\"Is that you, Laban?\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"Yes--'tis come.  He's not to die.  'Tis confinement during Her\nMajesty's pleasure.\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\" said Coggan, with a swelling heart.  \"God's above the devil\nyet!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI\n\n\nBEAUTY IN LONELINESS--AFTER ALL\n\n\nBathsheba revived with the spring.  The utter prostration that\nhad followed the low fever from which she had suffered diminished\nperceptibly when all uncertainty upon every subject had come to\nan end.\n\nBut she remained alone now for the greater part of her time, and\nstayed in the house, or at furthest went into the garden.  She\nshunned every one, even Liddy, and could be brought to make no\nconfidences, and to ask for no sympathy.\n\nAs the summer drew on she passed more of her time in the open air,\nand began to examine into farming matters from sheer necessity,\nthough she never rode out or personally superintended as at former\ntimes.  One Friday evening in August she walked a little way along\nthe road and entered the village for the first time since the sombre\nevent of the preceding Christmas.  None of the old colour had as yet\ncome to her cheek, and its absolute paleness was heightened by the\njet black of her gown, till it appeared preternatural.  When she\nreached a little shop at the other end of the place, which stood\nnearly opposite to the churchyard, Bathsheba heard singing inside the\nchurch, and she knew that the singers were practising.  She crossed\nthe road, opened the gate, and entered the graveyard, the high sills\nof the church windows effectually screening her from the eyes of\nthose gathered within.  Her stealthy walk was to the nook wherein\nTroy had worked at planting flowers upon Fanny Robin's grave, and\nshe came to the marble tombstone.\n\nA motion of satisfaction enlivened her face as she read the complete\ninscription.  First came the words of Troy himself:--\n\n\n     ERECTED BY FRANCIS TROY\n      IN BELOVED MEMORY OF\n          FANNY ROBIN,\n    WHO DIED OCTOBER 9, 18--,\n          AGED 20 YEARS\n\n\nUnderneath this was now inscribed in new letters:--\n\n\n      IN THE SAME GRAVE LIE\n   THE REMAINS OF THE AFORESAID\n          FRANCIS TROY,\n   WHO DIED DECEMBER 24TH, 18--,\n          AGED 26 YEARS\n\n\nWhilst she stood and read and meditated the tones of the organ\nbegan again in the church, and she went with the same light step\nround to the porch and listened.  The door was closed, and the\nchoir was learning a new hymn.  Bathsheba was stirred by emotions\nwhich latterly she had assumed to be altogether dead within her.\nThe little attenuated voices of the children brought to her ear\nin distinct utterance the words they sang without thought or\ncomprehension--\n\n\n     Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,\n       Lead Thou me on.\n\n\nBathsheba's feeling was always to some extent dependent upon her\nwhim, as is the case with many other women.  Something big came into\nher throat and an uprising to her eyes--and she thought that she\nwould allow the imminent tears to flow if they wished.  They did\nflow and plenteously, and one fell upon the stone bench beside her.\nOnce that she had begun to cry for she hardly knew what, she could\nnot leave off for crowding thoughts she knew too well.  She would\nhave given anything in the world to be, as those children were,\nunconcerned at the meaning of their words, because too innocent to\nfeel the necessity for any such expression.  All the impassioned\nscenes of her brief experience seemed to revive with added emotion at\nthat moment, and those scenes which had been without emotion during\nenactment had emotion then.  Yet grief came to her rather as a luxury\nthan as the scourge of former times.\n\nOwing to Bathsheba's face being buried in her hands she did not\nnotice a form which came quietly into the porch, and on seeing\nher, first moved as if to retreat, then paused and regarded her.\nBathsheba did not raise her head for some time, and when she looked\nround her face was wet, and her eyes drowned and dim.  \"Mr. Oak,\"\nexclaimed she, disconcerted, \"how long have you been here?\"\n\n\"A few minutes, ma'am,\" said Oak, respectfully.\n\n\"Are you going in?\" said Bathsheba; and there came from within the\nchurch as from a prompter--\n\n\n     I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,\n     Pride ruled my will: remember not past years.\n\n\n\"I was,\" said Gabriel.  \"I am one of the bass singers, you know.  I\nhave sung bass for several months.\"\n\n\"Indeed: I wasn't aware of that.  I'll leave you, then.\"\n\n\n     Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile,\n\n\nsang the children.\n\n\"Don't let me drive you away, mistress.  I think I won't go in\nto-night.\"\n\n\"Oh no--you don't drive me away.\"\n\nThen they stood in a state of some embarrassment, Bathsheba trying to\nwipe her dreadfully drenched and inflamed face without his noticing\nher.  At length Oak said, \"I've not seen you--I mean spoken to\nyou--since ever so long, have I?\"  But he feared to bring distressing\nmemories back, and interrupted himself with: \"Were you going into\nchurch?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said.  \"I came to see the tombstone privately--to see if\nthey had cut the inscription as I wished.  Mr. Oak, you needn't mind\nspeaking to me, if you wish to, on the matter which is in both our\nminds at this moment.\"\n\n\"And have they done it as you wished?\" said Oak.\n\n\"Yes.  Come and see it, if you have not already.\"\n\nSo together they went and read the tomb.  \"Eight months ago!\" Gabriel\nmurmured when he saw the date.  \"It seems like yesterday to me.\"\n\n\"And to me as if it were years ago--long years, and I had been dead\nbetween.  And now I am going home, Mr. Oak.\"\n\nOak walked after her.  \"I wanted to name a small matter to you as\nsoon as I could,\" he said, with hesitation.  \"Merely about business,\nand I think I may just mention it now, if you'll allow me.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, certainly.\"\n\n\"It is that I may soon have to give up the management of your farm,\nMrs. Troy.  The fact is, I am thinking of leaving England--not yet,\nyou know--next spring.\"\n\n\"Leaving England!\" she said, in surprise and genuine disappointment.\n\"Why, Gabriel, what are you going to do that for?\"\n\n\"Well, I've thought it best,\" Oak stammered out.  \"California is the\nspot I've had in my mind to try.\"\n\n\"But it is understood everywhere that you are going to take poor Mr.\nBoldwood's farm on your own account.\"\n\n\"I've had the refusal o' it 'tis true; but nothing is settled yet,\nand I have reasons for giving up.  I shall finish out my year there\nas manager for the trustees, but no more.\"\n\n\"And what shall I do without you?  Oh, Gabriel, I don't think you\nought to go away.  You've been with me so long--through bright times\nand dark times--such old friends as we are--that it seems unkind\nalmost.  I had fancied that if you leased the other farm as master,\nyou might still give a helping look across at mine.  And now going\naway!\"\n\n\"I would have willingly.\"\n\n\"Yet now that I am more helpless than ever you go away!\"\n\n\"Yes, that's the ill fortune o' it,\" said Gabriel, in a distressed\ntone.  \"And it is because of that very helplessness that I feel bound\nto go.  Good afternoon, ma'am\" he concluded, in evident anxiety to\nget away, and at once went out of the churchyard by a path she could\nfollow on no pretence whatever.\n\nBathsheba went home, her mind occupied with a new trouble, which\nbeing rather harassing than deadly was calculated to do good by\ndiverting her from the chronic gloom of her life.  She was set\nthinking a great deal about Oak and of his wish to shun her;\nand there occurred to Bathsheba several incidents of her latter\nintercourse with him, which, trivial when singly viewed, amounted\ntogether to a perceptible disinclination for her society.  It broke\nupon her at length as a great pain that her last old disciple was\nabout to forsake her and flee.  He who had believed in her and argued\non her side when all the rest of the world was against her, had at\nlast like the others become weary and neglectful of the old cause,\nand was leaving her to fight her battles alone.\n\nThree weeks went on, and more evidence of his want of interest in\nher was forthcoming.  She noticed that instead of entering the small\nparlour or office where the farm accounts were kept, and waiting, or\nleaving a memorandum as he had hitherto done during her seclusion,\nOak never came at all when she was likely to be there, only entering\nat unseasonable hours when her presence in that part of the house\nwas least to be expected.  Whenever he wanted directions he sent a\nmessage, or note with neither heading nor signature, to which she was\nobliged to reply in the same offhand style.  Poor Bathsheba began to\nsuffer now from the most torturing sting of all--a sensation that she\nwas despised.\n\nThe autumn wore away gloomily enough amid these melancholy\nconjectures, and Christmas-day came, completing a year of her legal\nwidowhood, and two years and a quarter of her life alone.  On\nexamining her heart it appeared beyond measure strange that the\nsubject of which the season might have been supposed suggestive--the\nevent in the hall at Boldwood's--was not agitating her at all; but\ninstead, an agonizing conviction that everybody abjured her--for what\nshe could not tell--and that Oak was the ringleader of the recusants.\nComing out of church that day she looked round in hope that Oak,\nwhose bass voice she had heard rolling out from the gallery overhead\nin a most unconcerned manner, might chance to linger in her path in\nthe old way.  There he was, as usual, coming down the path behind\nher.  But on seeing Bathsheba turn, he looked aside, and as soon\nas he got beyond the gate, and there was the barest excuse for a\ndivergence, he made one, and vanished.\n\nThe next morning brought the culminating stroke; she had been\nexpecting it long.  It was a formal notice by letter from him that he\nshould not renew his engagement with her for the following Lady-day.\n\nBathsheba actually sat and cried over this letter most bitterly.  She\nwas aggrieved and wounded that the possession of hopeless love from\nGabriel, which she had grown to regard as her inalienable right for\nlife, should have been withdrawn just at his own pleasure in this\nway.  She was bewildered too by the prospect of having to rely on her\nown resources again: it seemed to herself that she never could again\nacquire energy sufficient to go to market, barter, and sell.\nSince Troy's death Oak had attended all sales and fairs for her,\ntransacting her business at the same time with his own.  What should\nshe do now?  Her life was becoming a desolation.\n\nSo desolate was Bathsheba this evening, that in an absolute hunger\nfor pity and sympathy, and miserable in that she appeared to have\noutlived the only true friendship she had ever owned, she put on her\nbonnet and cloak and went down to Oak's house just after sunset,\nguided on her way by the pale primrose rays of a crescent moon a few\ndays old.\n\nA lively firelight shone from the window, but nobody was visible in\nthe room.  She tapped nervously, and then thought it doubtful if\nit were right for a single woman to call upon a bachelor who lived\nalone, although he was her manager, and she might be supposed to call\non business without any real impropriety.  Gabriel opened the door,\nand the moon shone upon his forehead.\n\n\"Mr. Oak,\" said Bathsheba, faintly.\n\n\"Yes; I am Mr. Oak,\" said Gabriel.  \"Who have I the honour--O how\nstupid of me, not to know you, mistress!\"\n\n\"I shall not be your mistress much longer, shall I Gabriel?\" she\nsaid, in pathetic tones.\n\n\"Well, no.  I suppose--But come in, ma'am.  Oh--and I'll get a\nlight,\" Oak replied, with some awkwardness.\n\n\"No; not on my account.\"\n\n\"It is so seldom that I get a lady visitor that I'm afraid I haven't\nproper accommodation.  Will you sit down, please? Here's a chair, and\nthere's one, too.  I am sorry that my chairs all have wood seats, and\nare rather hard, but I--was thinking of getting some new ones.\"  Oak\nplaced two or three for her.\n\n\"They are quite easy enough for me.\"\n\nSo down she sat, and down sat he, the fire dancing in their faces,\nand upon the old furniture,\n\n\n            all a-sheenen\n     Wi' long years o' handlen, [3]\n\n   [Footnote 3: W. Barnes]\n\nthat formed Oak's array of household possessions, which sent back a\ndancing reflection in reply.  It was very odd to these two persons,\nwho knew each other passing well, that the mere circumstance of their\nmeeting in a new place and in a new way should make them so awkward\nand constrained.  In the fields, or at her house, there had never\nbeen any embarrassment; but now that Oak had become the entertainer\ntheir lives seemed to be moved back again to the days when they were\nstrangers.\n\n\"You'll think it strange that I have come, but--\"\n\n\"Oh no; not at all.\"\n\n\"But I thought--Gabriel, I have been uneasy in the belief that I\nhave offended you, and that you are going away on that account.  It\ngrieved me very much and I couldn't help coming.\"\n\n\"Offended me!  As if you could do that, Bathsheba!\"\n\n\"Haven't I?\" she asked, gladly.  \"But, what are you going away for\nelse?\"\n\n\"I am not going to emigrate, you know; I wasn't aware that you would\nwish me not to when I told 'ee or I shouldn't ha' thought of doing\nit,\" he said, simply.  \"I have arranged for Little Weatherbury Farm\nand shall have it in my own hands at Lady-day.  You know I've had a\nshare in it for some time.  Still, that wouldn't prevent my attending\nto your business as before, hadn't it been that things have been said\nabout us.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Bathsheba, in surprise.  \"Things said about you and me!\nWhat are they?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you.\"\n\n\"It would be wiser if you were to, I think.  You have played the part\nof mentor to me many times, and I don't see why you should fear to do\nit now.\"\n\n\"It is nothing that you have done, this time.  The top and tail\no't is this--that I am sniffing about here, and waiting for poor\nBoldwood's farm, with a thought of getting you some day.\"\n\n\"Getting me!  What does that mean?\"\n\n\"Marrying of 'ee, in plain British.  You asked me to tell, so you\nmustn't blame me.\"\n\nBathsheba did not look quite so alarmed as if a cannon had been\ndischarged by her ear, which was what Oak had expected.  \"Marrying\nme!  I didn't know it was that you meant,\" she said, quietly.  \"Such\na thing as that is too absurd--too soon--to think of, by far!\"\n\n\"Yes; of course, it is too absurd.  I don't desire any such thing;\nI should think that was plain enough by this time.  Surely, surely\nyou be the last person in the world I think of marrying.  It is too\nabsurd, as you say.\"\n\n\"'Too--s-s-soon' were the words I used.\"\n\n\"I must beg your pardon for correcting you, but you said, 'too\nabsurd,' and so do I.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon too!\" she returned, with tears in her eyes.  \"'Too\nsoon' was what I said.  But it doesn't matter a bit--not at all--but\nI only meant, 'too soon.'  Indeed, I didn't, Mr. Oak, and you must\nbelieve me!\"\n\nGabriel looked her long in the face, but the firelight being faint\nthere was not much to be seen.  \"Bathsheba,\" he said, tenderly and in\nsurprise, and coming closer: \"if I only knew one thing--whether you\nwould allow me to love you and win you, and marry you after all--if\nI only knew that!\"\n\n\"But you never will know,\" she murmured.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because you never ask.\"\n\n\"Oh--Oh!\" said Gabriel, with a low laugh of joyousness.  \"My own\ndear--\"\n\n\"You ought not to have sent me that harsh letter this morning,\" she\ninterrupted.  \"It shows you didn't care a bit about me, and were\nready to desert me like all the rest of them!  It was very cruel of\nyou, considering I was the first sweetheart that you ever had, and\nyou were the first I ever had; and I shall not forget it!\"\n\n\"Now, Bathsheba, was ever anybody so provoking,\" he said, laughing.\n\"You know it was purely that I, as an unmarried man, carrying on a\nbusiness for you as a very taking young woman, had a proper hard part\nto play--more particular that people knew I had a sort of feeling for\n'ee; and I fancied, from the way we were mentioned together, that it\nmight injure your good name.  Nobody knows the heat and fret I have\nbeen caused by it.\"\n\n\"And was that all?\"\n\n\"All.\"\n\n\"Oh, how glad I am I came!\" she exclaimed, thankfully, as she rose\nfrom her seat.  \"I have thought so much more of you since I fancied\nyou did not want even to see me again.  But I must be going now, or\nI shall be missed.  Why Gabriel,\" she said, with a slight laugh, as\nthey went to the door, \"it seems exactly as if I had come courting\nyou--how dreadful!\"\n\n\"And quite right too,\" said Oak.  \"I've danced at your skittish\nheels, my beautiful Bathsheba, for many a long mile, and many a long\nday; and it is hard to begrudge me this one visit.\"\n\nHe accompanied her up the hill, explaining to her the details of\nhis forthcoming tenure of the other farm.  They spoke very little\nof their mutual feeling; pretty phrases and warm expressions being\nprobably unnecessary between such tried friends.  Theirs was that\nsubstantial affection which arises (if any arises at all) when the\ntwo who are thrown together begin first by knowing the rougher\nsides of each other's character, and not the best till further on,\nthe romance growing up in the interstices of a mass of hard prosaic\nreality.  This good-fellowship--_camaraderie_--usually occurring\nthrough similarity of pursuits, is unfortunately seldom superadded\nto love between the sexes, because men and women associate, not in\ntheir labours, but in their pleasures merely.  Where, however, happy\ncircumstance permits its development, the compounded feeling proves\nitself to be the only love which is strong as death--that love which\nmany waters cannot quench, nor the floods drown, beside which the\npassion usually called by the name is evanescent as steam.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII\n\n\nA FOGGY NIGHT AND MORNING--CONCLUSION\n\n\n\"The most private, secret, plainest wedding that it is possible to\nhave.\"\n\nThose had been Bathsheba's words to Oak one evening, some time after\nthe event of the preceding f, and he meditated a full hour by\nthe clock upon how to carry out her wishes to the letter.\n\n\"A license--O yes, it must be a license,\" he said to himself at last.\n\"Very well, then; first, a license.\"\n\nOn a dark night, a few days later, Oak came with mysterious steps\nfrom the surrogate's door, in Casterbridge.  On the way home he heard\na heavy tread in front of him, and, overtaking the man, found him to\nbe Coggan.  They walked together into the village until they came to\na little lane behind the church, leading down to the cottage of Laban\nTall, who had lately been installed as clerk of the parish, and was\nyet in mortal terror at church on Sundays when he heard his lone\nvoice among certain hard words of the Psalms, whither no man ventured\nto follow him.\n\n\"Well, good-night, Coggan,\" said Oak, \"I'm going down this way.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Coggan, surprised; \"what's going on to-night then, make so\nbold Mr. Oak?\"\n\nIt seemed rather ungenerous not to tell Coggan, under the\ncircumstances, for Coggan had been true as steel all through the time\nof Gabriel's unhappiness about Bathsheba, and Gabriel said, \"You can\nkeep a secret, Coggan?\"\n\n\"You've proved me, and you know.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have, and I do know.  Well, then, mistress and I mean to get\nmarried to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Heaven's high tower!  And yet I've thought of such a thing from time\nto time; true, I have.  But keeping it so close!  Well, there, 'tis\nno consarn of of mine, and I wish 'ee joy o' her.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Coggan.  But I assure 'ee that this great hush is not\nwhat I wished for at all, or what either of us would have wished if\nit hadn't been for certain things that would make a gay wedding seem\nhardly the thing.  Bathsheba has a great wish that all the parish\nshall not be in church, looking at her--she's shy-like and nervous\nabout it, in fact--so I be doing this to humour her.\"\n\n\"Ay, I see: quite right, too, I suppose I must say.  And you be now\ngoing down to the clerk.\"\n\n\"Yes; you may as well come with me.\"\n\n\"I am afeard your labour in keeping it close will be throwed away,\"\nsaid Coggan, as they walked along.  \"Labe Tall's old woman will horn\nit all over parish in half-an-hour.\"\n\n\"So she will, upon my life; I never thought of that,\" said Oak,\npausing.  \"Yet I must tell him to-night, I suppose, for he's working\nso far off, and leaves early.\"\n\n\"I'll tell 'ee how we could tackle her,\" said Coggan.  \"I'll knock\nand ask to speak to Laban outside the door, you standing in the\nbackground.  Then he'll come out, and you can tell yer tale.  She'll\nnever guess what I want en for; and I'll make up a few words about\nthe farm-work, as a blind.\"\n\nThis scheme was considered feasible; and Coggan advanced boldly, and\nrapped at Mrs. Tall's door.  Mrs. Tall herself opened it.\n\n\"I wanted to have a word with Laban.\"\n\n\"He's not at home, and won't be this side of eleven o'clock.  He've\nbeen forced to go over to Yalbury since shutting out work.  I shall\ndo quite as well.\"\n\n\"I hardly think you will.  Stop a moment;\" and Coggan stepped round\nthe corner of the porch to consult Oak.\n\n\"Who's t'other man, then?\" said Mrs. Tall.\n\n\"Only a friend,\" said Coggan.\n\n\"Say he's wanted to meet mistress near church-hatch to-morrow morning\nat ten,\" said Oak, in a whisper.  \"That he must come without fail,\nand wear his best clothes.\"\n\n\"The clothes will floor us as safe as houses!\" said Coggan.\n\n\"It can't be helped,\" said Oak.  \"Tell her.\"\n\nSo Coggan delivered the message.  \"Mind, het or wet, blow or snow,\nhe must come,\" added Jan.  \"'Tis very particular, indeed.  The fact\nis, 'tis to witness her sign some law-work about taking shares wi'\nanother farmer for a long span o' years.  There, that's what 'tis,\nand now I've told 'ee, Mother Tall, in a way I shouldn't ha' done\nif I hadn't loved 'ee so hopeless well.\"\n\nCoggan retired before she could ask any further; and next they called\nat the vicar's in a manner which excited no curiosity at all.  Then\nGabriel went home, and prepared for the morrow.\n\n\n\"Liddy,\" said Bathsheba, on going to bed that night, \"I want you to\ncall me at seven o'clock to-morrow, In case I shouldn't wake.\"\n\n\"But you always do wake afore then, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I have something important to do, which I'll tell you of\nwhen the time comes, and it's best to make sure.\"\n\nBathsheba, however, awoke voluntarily at four, nor could she by any\ncontrivance get to sleep again.  About six, being quite positive that\nher watch had stopped during the night, she could wait no longer.\nShe went and tapped at Liddy's door, and after some labour awoke her.\n\n\"But I thought it was I who had to call you?\" said the bewildered\nLiddy.  \"And it isn't six yet.\"\n\n\"Indeed it is; how can you tell such a story, Liddy?  I know it must\nbe ever so much past seven.  Come to my room as soon as you can; I\nwant you to give my hair a good brushing.\"\n\nWhen Liddy came to Bathsheba's room her mistress was already waiting.\nLiddy could not understand this extraordinary promptness.  \"Whatever\nIS going on, ma'am?\" she said.\n\n\"Well, I'll tell you,\" said Bathsheba, with a mischievous smile in\nher bright eyes.  \"Farmer Oak is coming here to dine with me to-day!\"\n\n\"Farmer Oak--and nobody else?--you two alone?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But is it safe, ma'am, after what's been said?\" asked her companion,\ndubiously.  \"A woman's good name is such a perishable article that--\"\n\nBathsheba laughed with a flushed cheek, and whispered in Liddy's ear,\nalthough there was nobody present.  Then Liddy stared and exclaimed,\n\"Souls alive, what news!  It makes my heart go quite bumpity-bump!\"\n\n\"It makes mine rather furious, too,\" said Bathsheba.  \"However,\nthere's no getting out of it now!\"\n\nIt was a damp disagreeable morning.  Nevertheless, at twenty minutes\nto ten o'clock, Oak came out of his house, and\n\n\n              Went up the hill side\n              With that sort of stride\n     A man puts out when walking in search of a bride,\n\n\nand knocked Bathsheba's door.  Ten minutes later a large and a\nsmaller umbrella might have been seen moving from the same door, and\nthrough the mist along the road to the church.  The distance was not\nmore than a quarter of a mile, and these two sensible persons deemed\nit unnecessary to drive.  An observer must have been very close\nindeed to discover that the forms under the umbrellas were those of\nOak and Bathsheba, arm-in-arm for the first time in their lives, Oak\nin a greatcoat extending to his knees, and Bathsheba in a cloak that\nreached her clogs.  Yet, though so plainly dressed, there was a\ncertain rejuvenated appearance about her:--\n\n\n     As though a rose should shut and be a bud again.\n\n\nRepose had again incarnadined her cheeks; and having, at Gabriel's\nrequest, arranged her hair this morning as she had worn it years ago\non Norcombe Hill, she seemed in his eyes remarkably like a girl of\nthat fascinating dream, which, considering that she was now only\nthree or four-and-twenty, was perhaps not very wonderful.  In the\nchurch were Tall, Liddy, and the parson, and in a remarkably short\nspace of time the deed was done.\n\nThe two sat down very quietly to tea in Bathsheba's parlour in the\nevening of the same day, for it had been arranged that Farmer Oak\nshould go there to live, since he had as yet neither money, house,\nnor furniture worthy of the name, though he was on a sure way towards\nthem, whilst Bathsheba was, comparatively, in a plethora of all\nthree.\n\nJust as Bathsheba was pouring out a cup of tea, their ears were\ngreeted by the firing of a cannon, followed by what seemed like a\ntremendous blowing of trumpets, in the front of the house.\n\n\"There!\" said Oak, laughing, \"I knew those fellows were up to\nsomething, by the look on their faces\"\n\nOak took up the light and went into the porch, followed by Bathsheba\nwith a shawl over her head.  The rays fell upon a group of male\nfigures gathered upon the gravel in front, who, when they saw the\nnewly-married couple in the porch, set up a loud \"Hurrah!\" and at the\nsame moment bang again went the cannon in the background, followed by\na hideous clang of music from a drum, tambourine, clarionet, serpent,\nhautboy, tenor-viol, and double-bass--the only remaining relics\nof the true and original Weatherbury band--venerable worm-eaten\ninstruments, which had celebrated in their own persons the victories\nof Marlborough, under the fingers of the forefathers of those who\nplayed them now.  The performers came forward, and marched up to the\nfront.\n\n\"Those bright boys, Mark Clark and Jan, are at the bottom of all\nthis,\" said Oak.  \"Come in, souls, and have something to eat and\ndrink wi' me and my wife.\"\n\n\"Not to-night,\" said Mr. Clark, with evident self-denial.  \"Thank\nye all the same; but we'll call at a more seemly time.  However, we\ncouldn't think of letting the day pass without a note of admiration\nof some sort.  If ye could send a drop of som'at down to Warren's,\nwhy so it is.  Here's long life and happiness to neighbour Oak and\nhis comely bride!\"\n\n\"Thank ye; thank ye all,\" said Gabriel.  \"A bit and a drop shall be\nsent to Warren's for ye at once.  I had a thought that we might very\nlikely get a salute of some sort from our old friends, and I was\nsaying so to my wife but now.\"\n\n\"Faith,\" said Coggan, in a critical tone, turning to his companions,\n\"the man hev learnt to say 'my wife' in a wonderful naterel way,\nconsidering how very youthful he is in wedlock as yet--hey,\nneighbours all?\"\n\n\"I never heerd a skilful old married feller of twenty years'\nstanding pipe 'my wife' in a more used note than 'a did,\" said Jacob\nSmallbury.  \"It might have been a little more true to nater if't had\nbeen spoke a little chillier, but that wasn't to be expected just\nnow.\"\n\n\"That improvement will come wi' time,\" said Jan, twirling his eye.\n\nThen Oak laughed, and Bathsheba smiled (for she never laughed readily\nnow), and their friends turned to go.\n\n\"Yes; I suppose that's the size o't,\" said Joseph Poorgrass with a\ncheerful sigh as they moved away; \"and I wish him joy o' her; though\nI were once or twice upon saying to-day with holy Hosea, in my\nscripture manner, which is my second nature, 'Ephraim is joined to\nidols: let him alone.'  But since 'tis as 'tis, why, it might have\nbeen worse, and I feel my thanks accordingly.\"\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 107-8.txt or 107-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/1\/0\/107\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":436,"split":"train"}
