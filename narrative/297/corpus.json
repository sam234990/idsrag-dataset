{"ori_id":"4499cd7074278be578db6861f7862c3a846e1f5d","title":"Pudd'nhead Wilson","context":"Pudd'nhead Wilson\n The setting is the fictional Missouri frontier town of Dawson's Landing on the banks of the Mississippi River in the first half of the 19th century. David Wilson, a young lawyer, moves to town and a clever remark of his is misunderstood, which causes locals to brand him a \"pudd'nhead\"\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 a nitwit. His hobby of collecting fingerprints does not raise his standing in the townsfolk's eyes, who see him as an eccentric and do not frequent his law practice.\nPuddn'head Wilson moves into the background as the focus shifts to the slave Roxy, her son, and the family they serve. Roxy is only one-sixteenth black, and her son Valet de Chambre (referred to as \"Chambers\") is only 1\/32 black. Roxy is principally charged with caring for her inattentive master's infant son Tom Driscoll, who is the same age as her own son. After fellow slaves are caught stealing and are nearly sold \"down the river\", to a master further south, Roxy fears for her life and the life of her son. First she decides to kill herself and Chambers to avoid being sold down the river, but then decides instead to switch Chambers and Tom in their cribs so that her son will live a life of privilege.\nThe narrative moves forward two decades, and Tom Driscoll (formerly Valet de Chambre), believing himself to be wholly white and raised as a spoiled aristocrat, has grown to be a selfish and dissolute young man. Tom's father has died and granted Roxy her freedom. Roxy worked for a time on river boats, and saved money for her retirement. When she finally is able to retire, she discovers that her bank has failed and all of her savings are gone. She returns to Dawson's Landing to ask for money from Tom.\nTom meets Roxy with derision and Roxy tells him that he is her son, and uses this fact to blackmail him into financially supporting her.\nTwin Italian noblemen visit the town to some fanfare, and Tom quarrels with one. Then at last, desperate for money, Tom robs and murders his wealthy uncle and the blame falls wrongly on one of the Italians. Thereafter the story takes on the form of a crime novel. In a courtroom scene, the whole mystery is solved when Wilson demonstrates, through fingerprints, that Tom is both the murderer, and not the real Driscoll heir.\nThe book ends in bitter irony. Although the real Tom Driscoll is restored to his rights, his life changes for the worse, for having been raised a slave, he feels intense unease in white society, while as a white man he is forever excluded from the company of blacks.\nIn a final twist, the murdered man's creditors successfully petition the governor to have Tom's death sentence overturned. Now that he is shown to be black, he is a slave, and as such, is rightfully their property. His sale \"down the river\" helps them recoup their losses.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson, by\nMark Twain (Samuel Clemens)\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

These chapters are\nright, now, in every detail, for they were rewritten under the immediate\neye of William Hicks, who studied law part of a while in southwest\nMissouri thirty-five years ago and then came over here to Florence for\nhis health and is still helping for exercise and board in Macaroni\nVermicelli's horse-feed shed, which is up the back alley as you turn\naround the corner out of the Piazza del Duomo just beyond the house where\nthat stone that Dante used to sit on six hundred years ago is let into\nthe wall when he let on to be watching them build Giotto's campanile and\nyet always got tired looking as Beatrice passed along on her way to get a\nchunk of chestnut cake to defend herself with in case of a Ghibelline\noutbreak before she got to school, at the same old stand where they sell\nthe same old cake to this day and it is just as light and good as it was\nthen, too, and this is not flattery, far from it. He was a little rusty\non his law, but he rubbed up for this book, and those two or three legal\nchapters are right and straight, now. He told me so himself.\n\nGiven under my hand this second day of January, 1893, at the Villa\nViviani, village of Settignano, three miles back of Florence, on the\nhills--the same certainly affording the most charming view to be found\non this planet, and with it the most dreamlike and enchanting sunsets to\nbe found in any planet or even in any solar system--and given, too, in\nthe swell room of the house, with the busts of Cerretani senators and\nother grandees of this line looking approvingly down upon me, as they\nused to look down upon Dante, and mutely asking me to adopt them into my\nfamily, which I do with pleasure, for my remotest ancestors are but\nspring chickens compared with these robed and stately antiques, and it\nwill be a great and satisfying lift for me, that six hundred years will.\n\nMark Twain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 -- Pudd'nhead Wins His Name\n\n     _Tell the truth or trump--but get the trick._ --Pudd'nhead\n     Wilson's Calendar\n\n\nThe scene of this chronicle is the town of Dawson's Landing, on the\nMissouri side of the Mississippi, half a day's journey, per steamboat,\nbelow St. Louis.\n\nIn 1830 it was a snug collection of modest one- and two-story frame\ndwellings, whose whitewashed exteriors were almost concealed from sight\nby climbing tangles of rose vines, honeysuckles, and morning glories.\nEach of these pretty homes had a garden in front fenced with white\npalings and opulently stocked with hollyhocks, marigolds, touch-me-nots,\nprince's-feathers, and other old-fashioned flowers; while on the\nwindowsills of the houses stood wooden boxes containing moss rose plants\nand terra-cotta pots in which grew a breed of geranium whose spread of\nintensely red blossoms accented the prevailing pink tint of the rose-clad\nhouse-front like an explosion of flame. When there was room on the ledge\noutside of the pots and boxes for a cat, the cat was there--in sunny\nweather--stretched at full length, asleep and blissful, with her furry\nbelly to the sun and a paw curved over her nose. Then that house was\ncomplete, and its contentment and peace were made manifest to the world\nby this symbol, whose testimony is infallible. A home without a cat--and\na well-fed, well-petted, and properly revered cat--may be a perfect\nhome, perhaps, but how can it prove title?\n\nAll along the streets, on both sides, at the outer edge of the brick\nsidewalks, stood locust trees with trunks protected by wooden boxing, and\nthese furnished shade for summer and a sweet fragrancer in spring, when\nthe clusters of buds came forth. The main street, one block back from\nthe river, and running parallel with it, was the sole business street.\nIt was six blocks long, and in each block two or three brick stores,\nthree stories high, towered above interjected bunches of little frame\nshops. Swinging signs creaked in the wind the street's whole length.\nThe candy-striped pole, which indicates nobility proud and ancient along\nthe palace-bordered canals of Venice, indicated merely the humble\nbarbershop along the main street of Dawson's Landing. On a chief corner\nstood a lofty unpainted pole wreathed from top to bottom with tin pots\nand pans and cups, the chief tinmonger's noisy notice to the world (when\nthe wind blew) that his shop was on hand for business at that corner.\n\nThe hamlet's front was washed by the clear waters of the great river; its\nbody stretched itself rearward up a gentle incline; its most rearward\nborder fringed itself out and scattered its houses about its base line of\nthe hills; the hills rose high, enclosing the town in a half-moon curve,\nclothed with forests from foot to summit.\n\nSteamboats passed up and down every hour or so. Those belonging to the\nlittle Cairo line and the little Memphis line always stopped; the big\nOrleans liners stopped for hails only, or to land passengers or freight;\nand this was the case also with the great flotilla of \"transients.\"\nThese latter came out of a dozen rivers--the Illinois, the Missouri, the\nUpper Mississippi, the Ohio, the Monongahela, the Tennessee, the Red\nRiver, the White River, and so on--and were bound every whither and\nstocked with every imaginable comfort or necessity, which the\nMississippi's communities could want, from the frosty Falls of St.\nAnthony down through nine climates to torrid New Orleans.\n\nDawson's Landing was a slaveholding town, with a rich, slave-worked grain\nand pork country back of it. The town was sleepy and comfortable and\ncontented. It was fifty years old, and was growing slowly--very slowly,\nin fact, but still it was growing.\n\nThe chief citizen was York Leicester Driscoll, about forty years old,\njudge of the county court. He was very proud of his old Virginian\nancestry, and in his hospitalities and his rather formal and stately\nmanners, he kept up its traditions. He was fine and just and generous.\nTo be a gentleman--a gentleman without stain or blemish--was his only\nreligion, and to it he was always faithful. He was respected, esteemed,\nand beloved by all of the community. He was well off, and was gradually\nadding to his store. He and his wife were very nearly happy, but not\nquite, for they had no children. The longing for the treasure of a child\nhad grown stronger and stronger as the years slipped away, but the\nblessing never came--and was never to come.\n\nWith this pair lived the judge's widowed sister, Mrs. Rachel Pratt, and\nshe also was childless--childless, and sorrowful for that reason, and not\nto be comforted. The women were good and commonplace people, and did\ntheir duty, and had their reward in clear consciences and the community's\napprobation. They were Presbyterians, the judge was a freethinker.\n\nPembroke Howard, lawyer and bachelor, aged almost forty, was another old\nVirginian grandee with proved descent from the First Families. He was a\nfine, majestic creature, a gentleman according to the nicest requirements\nof the Virginia rule, a devoted Presbyterian, an authority on the \"code\",\nand a man always courteously ready to stand up before you in the field if\nany act or word of his had seemed doubtful or suspicious to you, and\nexplain it with any weapon you might prefer from bradawls to artillery.\nHe was very popular with the people, and was the judge's dearest friend.\n\nThen there was Colonel Cecil Burleigh Essex, another F.F.V. of formidable\ncaliber--however, with him we have no concern.\n\nPercy Northumberland Driscoll, brother to the judge, and younger than he\nby five years, was a married man, and had had children around his\nhearthstone; but they were attacked in detail by measles, croup, and\nscarlet fever, and this had given the doctor a chance with his effective\nantediluvian methods; so the cradles were empty. He was a prosperous\nman, with a good head for speculations, and his fortune was growing. On\nthe first of February, 1830, two boy babes were born in his house; one to\nhim, one to one of his slave girls, Roxana by name. Roxana was twenty\nyears old. She was up and around the same day, with her hands full, for\nshe was tending both babes.\n\nMrs. Percy Driscoll died within the week. Roxy remained in charge of the\nchildren. She had her own way, for Mr. Driscoll soon absorbed himself in\nhis speculations and left her to her own devices.\n\nIn that same month of February, Dawson's Landing gained a new citizen.\nThis was Mr. David Wilson, a young fellow of Scotch parentage. He had\nwandered to this remote region from his birthplace in the interior of the\nState of New York, to seek his fortune. He was twenty-five years old,\ncollege bred, and had finished a post-college course in an Eastern law\nschool a couple of years before.\n\nHe was a homely, freckled, sandy-haired young fellow, with an intelligent\nblue eye that had frankness and comradeship in it and a covert twinkle of\na pleasant sort. But for an unfortunate remark of his, he would no doubt\nhave entered at once upon a successful career at Dawson's Landing. But he\nmade his fatal remark the first day he spent in the village, and it\n\"gaged\" him. He had just made the acquaintance of a group of citizens\nwhen an invisible dog began to yelp and snarl and howl and make himself\nvery comprehensively disagreeable, whereupon young Wilson said, much as\none who is thinking aloud:\n\n\"I wish I owned half of that dog.\"\n\n\"Why?\" somebody asked.\n\n\"Because I would kill my half.\"\n\nThe group searched his face with curiosity, with anxiety even, but found\nno light there, no expression that they could read. They fell away from\nhim as from something uncanny, and went into privacy to discuss him. One\nsaid:\n\n\"'Pears to be a fool.\"\n\n\"'Pears?\" said another. \"_Is,_ I reckon you better say.\"\n\n\"Said he wished he owned _half_ of the dog, the idiot,\" said a third.\n\"What did he reckon would become of the other half if he killed his half?\nDo you reckon he thought it would live?\"\n\n\"Why, he must have thought it, unless he IS the downrightest fool in the\nworld; because if he hadn't thought it, he would have wanted to own the\nwhole dog, knowing that if he killed his half and the other half died, he\nwould be responsible for that half just the same as if he had killed that\nhalf instead of his own. Don't it look that way to you, gents?\"\n\n\"Yes, it does. If he owned one half of the general dog, it would be so;\nif he owned one end of the dog and another person owned the other end, it\nwould be so, just the same; particularly in the first case, because if\nyou kill one half of a general dog, there ain't any man that can tell\nwhose half it was; but if he owned one end of the dog, maybe he could\nkill his end of it and--\"\n\n\"No, he couldn't either; he couldn't and not be responsible if the other\nend died, which it would. In my opinion that man ain't in his right\nmind.\"\n\n\"In my opinion he hain't _got_ any mind.\"\n\nNo. 3 said: \"Well, he's a lummox, anyway.\"\n\n\"That's what he is;\" said No. 4. \"He's a labrick--just a Simon-pure\nlabrick, if there was one.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, he's a dam fool. That's the way I put him up,\" said No. 5.\n\"Anybody can think different that wants to, but those are my sentiments.\"\n\n\"I'm with you, gentlemen,\" said No. 6. \"Perfect jackass--yes, and it\nain't going too far to say he is a pudd'nhead. If he ain't a pudd'nhead,\nI ain't no judge, that's all.\"\n\nMr. Wilson stood elected. The incident was told all over the town, and\ngravely discussed by everybody. Within a week he had lost his first\nname; Pudd'nhead took its place. In time he came to be liked, and well\nliked too; but by that time the nickname had got well stuck on, and it\nstayed. That first day's verdict made him a fool, and he was not able to\nget it set aside, or even modified. The nickname soon ceased to carry\nany harsh or unfriendly feeling with it, but it held its place, and was\nto continue to hold its place for twenty long years.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 -- Driscoll Spares His Slaves\n\n     _Adam was but human--this explains it all. He did not want\n     the apple for the apple's sake, he wanted it only because it\n     was forbidden. The mistake was in not forbidding the\n     serpent; then he would have eaten the serpent._ --Pudd'nhead\n     Wilson's Calendar\n\n\nPudd'nhead Wilson had a trifle of money when he arrived, and he bought a\nsmall house on the extreme western verge of the town. Between it and\nJudge Driscoll's house there was only a grassy yard, with a paling fence\ndividing the properties in the middle. He hired a small office down in\nthe town and hung out a tin sign with these words on it:\n\nD A V I D W I L S O N\n\nATTORNEY AND COUNSELOR-AT-LAW\n\nSURVEYING, CONVEYANCING, ETC.\n\nBut his deadly remark had ruined his chance--at least in the law. No\nclients came. He took down his sign, after a while, and put it up on his\nown house with the law features knocked out of it. It offered his\nservices now in the humble capacities of land surveyor and expert\naccountant. Now and then he got a job of surveying to do, and now and\nthen a merchant got him to straighten out his books. With Scotch patience\nand pluck he resolved to live down his reputation and work his way into\nthe legal field yet. Poor fellow, he could foresee that it was going to\ntake him such a weary long time to do it.\n\nHe had a rich abundance of idle time, but it never hung heavy on his\nhands, for he interested himself in every new thing that was born into\nthe universe of ideas, and studied it, and experimented upon it at his\nhouse. One of his pet fads was palmistry. To another one he gave no\nname, neither would he explain to anybody what its purpose was, but\nmerely said it was an amusement. In fact, he had found that his fads\nadded to his reputation as a pudd'nhead; there, he was growing chary of\nbeing too communicative about them. The fad without a name was one which\ndealt with people's finger marks. He carried in his coat pocket a\nshallow box with grooves in it, and in the grooves strips of glass five\ninches long and three inches wide. Along the lower edge of each strip\nwas pasted a slip of white paper. He asked people to pass their hands\nthrough their hair (thus collecting upon them a thin coating of the\nnatural oil) and then making a thumb-mark on a glass strip, following it\nwith the mark of the ball of each finger in succession. Under this row\nof faint grease prints he would write a record on the strip of white\npaper--thus:\n\nJOHN SMITH, right hand--\n\nand add the day of the month and the year, then take Smith's left hand on\nanother glass strip, and add name and date and the words \"left hand.\" The\nstrips were now returned to the grooved box, and took their place among\nwhat Wilson called his \"records.\"\n\nHe often studied his records, examining and poring over them with\nabsorbing interest until far into the night; but what he found there--if\nhe found anything--he revealed to no one. Sometimes he copied on paper\nthe involved and delicate pattern left by the ball of the finger, and\nthen vastly enlarged it with a pantograph so that he could examine its\nweb of curving lines with ease and convenience.\n\nOne sweltering afternoon--it was the first day of July, 1830--he was at\nwork over a set of tangled account books in his workroom, which looked\nwestward over a stretch of vacant lots, when a conversation outside\ndisturbed him. It was carried on in yells, which showed that the people\nengaged in it were not close together.\n\n\"Say, Roxy, how does yo' baby come on?\" This from the distant voice.\n\n\"Fust-rate. How does _you_ come on, Jasper?\" This yell was from close\nby.\n\n\"Oh, I's middlin'; hain't got noth'n' to complain of, I's gwine to come\na-court'n you bimeby, Roxy.\"\n\n\"_You_ is, you black mud cat! Yah--yah--yah! I got somep'n' better to\ndo den 'sociat'n' wid niggers as black as you is. Is ole Miss Cooper's\nNancy done give you de mitten?\" Roxy followed this sally with another\ndischarge of carefree laughter.\n\n\"You's jealous, Roxy, dat's what's de matter wid you, you\nhussy--yah--yah--yah! Dat's de time I got you!\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, _you_ got me, hain't you. 'Clah to goodness if dat conceit o'\nyo'n strikes in, Jasper, it gwine to kill you sho'. If you b'longed to\nme, I'd sell you down de river 'fo' you git too fur gone. Fust time I\nruns acrost yo' marster, I's gwine to tell him so.\"\n\nThis idle and aimless jabber went on and on, both parties enjoying the\nfriendly duel and each well satisfied with his own share of the wit\nexchanged--for wit they considered it.\n\nWilson stepped to the window to observe the combatants; he could not work\nwhile their chatter continued. Over in the vacant lots was Jasper,\nyoung, coal black, and of magnificent build, sitting on a wheelbarrow in\nthe pelting sun--at work, supposably, whereas he was in fact only\npreparing for it by taking an hour's rest before beginning. In front of\nWilson's porch stood Roxy, with a local handmade baby wagon, in which sat\nher two charges--one at each end and facing each other. From Roxy's\nmanner of speech, a stranger would have expected her to be black, but she\nwas not. Only one sixteenth of her was black, and that sixteenth did not\nshow. She was of majestic form and stature, her attitudes were imposing\nand statuesque, and her gestures and movements distinguished by a noble\nand stately grace. Her complexion was very fair, with the rosy glow of\nvigorous health in her cheeks, her face was full of character and\nexpression, her eyes were brown and liquid, and she had a heavy suit of\nfine soft hair which was also brown, but the fact was not apparent\nbecause her head was bound about with a checkered handkerchief and the\nhair was concealed under it. Her face was shapely, intelligent, and\ncomely--even beautiful. She had an easy, independent carriage--when she\nwas among her own caste--and a high and \"sassy\" way, withal; but of\ncourse she was meek and humble enough where white people were.\n\nTo all intents and purposes Roxy was as white as anybody, but the one\nsixteenth of her which was black outvoted the other fifteen parts and\nmade her a Negro. She was a slave, and salable as such. Her child was\nthirty-one parts white, and he, too, was a slave, and by a fiction of law\nand custom a Negro. He had blue eyes and flaxen curls like his white\ncomrade, but even the father of the white child was able to tell the\nchildren apart--little as he had commerce with them--by their clothes;\nfor the white babe wore ruffled soft muslin and a coral necklace, while\nthe other wore merely a coarse tow-linen shirt which barely reached to\nits knees, and no jewelry.\n\nThe white child's name was Thomas a Becket Driscoll, the other's name was\nValet de Chambre: no surname--slaves hadn't the privilege. Roxana had\nheard that phrase somewhere, the fine sound of it had pleased her ear,\nand as she had supposed it was a name, she loaded it on to her darling.\nIt soon got shorted to \"Chambers,\" of course.\n\nWilson knew Roxy by sight, and when the duel of wits begun to play out,\nhe stepped outside to gather in a record or two. Jasper went to work\nenergetically, at once, perceiving that his leisure was observed. Wilson\ninspected the children and asked:\n\n\"How old are they, Roxy?\"\n\n\"Bofe de same age, sir--five months. Bawn de fust o' Feb'uary.\"\n\n\"They're handsome little chaps. One's just as handsome as the other,\ntoo.\"\n\nA delighted smile exposed the girl's white teeth, and she said:\n\n\"Bless yo' soul, Misto Wilson, it's pow'ful nice o' you to say dat,\n'ca'se one of 'em ain't on'y a nigger. Mighty prime little nigger, _I_\nal'ays says, but dat's 'ca'se it's mine, o' course.\"\n\n\"How do you tell them apart, Roxy, when they haven't any clothes on?\"\n\nRoxy laughed a laugh proportioned to her size, and said:\n\n\"Oh, _I_ kin tell 'em 'part, Misto Wilson, but I bet Marse Percy\ncouldn't, not to save his life.\"\n\nWilson chatted along for awhile, and presently got Roxy's fingerprints\nfor his collection--right hand and left--on a couple of his glass strips;\nthen labeled and dated them, and took the \"records\" of both children, and\nlabeled and dated them also.\n\nTwo months later, on the third of September, he took this trio of finger\nmarks again. He liked to have a \"series,\" two or three \"takings\" at\nintervals during the period of childhood, these to be followed at\nintervals of several years.\n\nThe next day--that is to say, on the fourth of September--something\noccurred which profoundly impressed Roxana. Mr. Driscoll missed another\nsmall sum of money--which is a way of saying that this was not a new\nthing, but had happened before. In truth, it had happened three times\nbefore. Driscoll's patience was exhausted. He was a fairly humane man\ntoward slaves and other animals; he was an exceedingly humane man toward\nthe erring of his own race. Theft he could not abide, and plainly there\nwas a thief in his house. Necessarily the thief must be one of his\nNegros. Sharp measures must be taken. He called his servants before him.\nThere were three of these, besides Roxy: a man, a woman, and a boy\ntwelve years old. They were not related. Mr. Driscoll said:\n\n\"You have all been warned before. It has done no good. This time I will\nteach you a lesson. I will sell the thief. Which of you is the guilty\none?\"\n\nThey all shuddered at the threat, for here they had a good home, and a\nnew one was likely to be a change for the worse. The denial was general.\nNone had stolen anything--not money, anyway--a little sugar, or cake, or\nhoney, or something like that, that \"Marse Percy wouldn't mind or miss\"\nbut not money--never a cent of money. They were eloquent in their\nprotestations, but Mr. Driscoll was not moved by them. He answered each\nin turn with a stern \"Name the thief!\"\n\nThe truth was, all were guilty but Roxana; she suspected that the others\nwere guilty, but she did not know them to be so. She was horrified to\nthink how near she had come to being guilty herself; she had been saved\nin the nick of time by a revival in the colored Methodist Church, a\nfortnight before, at which time and place she \"got religion.\" The very\nnext day after that gracious experience, while her change of style was\nfresh upon her and she was vain of her purified condition, her master\nleft a couple dollars unprotected on his desk, and she happened upon that\ntemptation when she was polishing around with a dustrag. She looked at\nthe money awhile with a steady rising resentment, then she burst out\nwith:\n\n\"Dad blame dat revival, I wisht it had 'a' be'n put off till tomorrow!\"\n\nThen she covered the tempter with a book, and another member of the\nkitchen cabinet got it. She made this sacrifice as a matter of religious\netiquette; as a thing necessary just now, but by no means to be wrested\ninto a precedent; no, a week or two would limber up her piety, then she\nwould be rational again, and the next two dollars that got left out in\nthe cold would find a comforter--and she could name the comforter.\n\nWas she bad? Was she worse than the general run of her race? No. They\nhad an unfair show in the battle of life, and they held it no sin to take\nmilitary advantage of the enemy--in a small way; in a small way, but not\nin a large one. They would smouch provisions from the pantry whenever\nthey got a chance; or a brass thimble, or a cake of wax, or an emery bag,\nor a paper of needles, or a silver spoon, or a dollar bill, or small\narticles of clothing, or any other property of light value; and so far\nwere they from considering such reprisals sinful, that they would go to\nchurch and shout and pray the loudest and sincerest with their plunder in\ntheir pockets. A farm smokehouse had to be kept heavily padlocked, or\neven the colored deacon himself could not resist a ham when Providence\nshowed him in a dream, or otherwise, where such a thing hung lonesome,\nand longed for someone to love. But with a hundred hanging before him,\nthe deacon would not take two--that is, on the same night. On frosty\nnights the humane Negro prowler would warm the end of the plank and put\nit up under the cold claws of chickens roosting in a tree; a drowsy hen\nwould step on to the comfortable board, softly clucking her gratitude,\nand the prowler would dump her into his bag, and later into his stomach,\nperfectly sure that in taking this trifle from the man who daily robbed\nhim of an inestimable treasure--his liberty--he was not committing any\nsin that God would remember against him in the Last Great Day.\n\n\"Name the thief!\"\n\nFor the fourth time Mr. Driscoll had said it, and always in the same hard\ntone. And now he added these words of awful import:\n\n\"I give you one minute.\" He took out his watch. \"If at the end of that\ntime, you have not confessed, I will not only sell all four of you,\nBUT--I will sell you DOWN THE RIVER!\"\n\nIt was equivalent to condemning them to hell! No Missouri Negro doubted\nthis. Roxy reeled in her tracks, and the color vanished out of her face;\nthe others dropped to their knees as if they had been shot; tears gushed\nfrom their eyes, their supplicating hands went up, and three answers came\nin the one instant.\n\n\"I done it!\"\n\n\"I done it!\"\n\n\"I done it!--have mercy, marster--Lord have mercy on us po' niggers!\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said the master, putting up his watch, \"I will sell you\n_here_ though you don't deserve it. You ought to be sold down the\nriver.\"\n\nThe culprits flung themselves prone, in an ecstasy of gratitude, and\nkissed his feet, declaring that they would never forget his goodness and\nnever cease to pray for him as long as they lived. They were sincere, for\nlike a god he had stretched forth his mighty hand and closed the gates of\nhell against them. He knew, himself, that he had done a noble and\ngracious thing, and was privately well pleased with his magnanimity; and\nthat night he set the incident down in his diary, so that his son might\nread it in after years, and be thereby moved to deeds of gentleness and\nhumanity himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 -- Roxy Plays a Shrewd Trick\n\n     _Whoever has lived long enough to find out what life is,\n     knows how deep a debt of gratitude we owe to Adam, the first\n     great benefactor of our race. He brought death into the\n     world._ --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n\nPercy Driscoll slept well the night he saved his house minions from\ngoing down the river, but no wink of sleep visited Roxy's eyes. A\nprofound terror had taken possession of her. Her child could grow up and\nbe sold down the river! The thought crazed her with horror. If she dozed\nand lost herself for a moment, the next moment she was on her feet flying\nto her child's cradle to see if it was still there. Then she would gather\nit to her heart and pour out her love upon it in a frenzy of kisses,\nmoaning, crying, and saying, \"Dey sha'n't, oh, dey _sha'nt'!'_--yo' po'\nmammy will kill you fust!\"\n\nOnce, when she was tucking him back in its cradle again, the other child\nnestled in its sleep and attracted her attention. She went and stood\nover it a long time communing with herself.\n\n\"What has my po' baby done, dat he couldn't have yo' luck? He hain't done\nnuth'n. God was good to you; why warn't he good to him? Dey can't sell\n_you_ down de river. I hates yo' pappy; he hain't got no heart--for\nniggers, he hain't, anyways. I hates him, en I could kill him!\" She\npaused awhile, thinking; then she burst into wild sobbings again, and\nturned away, saying, \"Oh, I got to kill my chile, dey ain't no yuther\nway--killin' _him_ wouldn't save de chile fum goin' down de river. Oh, I\ngot to do it, yo' po' mammy's got to kill you to save you, honey.\" She\ngathered her baby to her bosom now, and began to smother it with\ncaresses. \"Mammy's got to kill you--how _kin_ I do it! But yo' mammy\nain't gwine to desert you--no, no, _dah_, don't cry--she gwine _wid_\nyou, she gwine to kill herself too. Come along, honey, come along wid\nmammy; we gwine to jump in de river, den troubles o' dis worl' is all\nover--dey don't sell po' niggers down the river over _yonder_.\"\n\nShe stared toward the door, crooning to the child and hushing it; midway\nshe stopped, suddenly. She had caught sight of her new Sunday gown--a\ncheap curtain-calico thing, a conflagration of gaudy colors and fantastic\nfigures. She surveyed it wistfully, longingly.\n\n\"Hain't ever wore it yet,\" she said, \"en it's just lovely.\" Then she\nnodded her head in response to a pleasant idea, and added, \"No, I ain't\ngwine to be fished out, wid everybody lookin' at me, in dis mis'able ole\nlinsey-woolsey.\"\n\nShe put down the child and made the change. She looked in the glass and\nwas astonished at her beauty. She resolved to make her death toilet\nperfect. She took off her handkerchief turban and dressed her glossy\nwealth of hair \"like white folks\"; she added some odds and ends of rather\nlurid ribbon and a spray of atrocious artificial flowers; finally she\nthrew over her shoulders a fluffy thing called a \"cloud\" in that day,\nwhich was of a blazing red complexion. Then she was ready for the tomb.\n\nShe gathered up her baby once more; but when her eye fell upon its\nmiserably short little gray tow-linen shirt and noted the contrast\nbetween its pauper shabbiness and her own volcanic eruption of infernal\nsplendors, her mother-heart was touched, and she was ashamed.\n\n\"No, dolling mammy ain't gwine to treat you so. De angels is gwine to\n'mire you jist as much as dey does yo' mammy. Ain't gwine to have 'em\nputt'n dey han's up 'fo' dey eyes en sayin' to David and Goliah en dem\nyuther prophets, 'Dat chile is dress' to indelicate fo' dis place.'\"\n\nBy this time she had stripped off the shirt. Now she clothed the naked\nlittle creature in one of Thomas `a Becket's snowy, long baby gowns, with\nits bright blue bows and dainty flummery of ruffles.\n\n\"Dah--now you's fixed.\" She propped the child in a chair and stood off\nto inspect it. Straightway her eyes begun to widen with astonishment and\nadmiration, and she clapped her hands and cried out, \"Why, it do beat\nall! I _never_ knowed you was so lovely. Marse Tommy ain't a bit\nputtier--not a single bit.\"\n\nShe stepped over and glanced at the other infant; she flung a glance\nback at her own; then one more at the heir of the house. Now a strange\nlight dawned in her eyes, and in a moment she was lost in thought. She\nseemed in a trance; when she came out of it, she muttered, \"When I 'uz\na-washin' 'em in de tub, yistiddy, he own pappy asked me which of 'em was\nhis'n.\"\n\nShe began to move around like one in a dream. She undressed Thomas `a\nBecket, stripping him of everything, and put the tow-linen shirt on him.\nShe put his coral necklace on her own child's neck. Then she placed the\nchildren side by side, and after earnest inspection she muttered:\n\n\"Now who would b'lieve clo'es could do de like o' dat? Dog my cats if it\nain't all _I_ kin do to tell t' other fum which, let alone his pappy.\"\n\nShe put her cub in Tommy's elegant cradle and said:\n\n\"You's young Marse _Tom_ fum dis out, en I got to practice and git used\nto 'memberin' to call you dat, honey, or I's gwine to make a mistake\nsometime en git us bofe into trouble. Dah--now you lay still en don't\nfret no mo', Marse Tom. Oh, thank de lord in heaven, you's saved, you's\nsaved! Dey ain't no man kin ever sell mammy's po' little honey down de\nriver now!\"\n\nShe put the heir of the house in her own child's unpainted pine cradle,\nand said, contemplating its slumbering form uneasily:\n\n\"I's sorry for you, honey; I's sorry, God knows I is--but what _kin_ I\ndo, what _could_ I do? Yo' pappy would sell him to somebody, sometime,\nen den he'd go down de river, sho', en I couldn't, couldn't, _couldn't_\nstan' it.\"\n\nShe flung herself on her bed and began to think and toss, toss and think.\nBy and by she sat suddenly upright, for a comforting thought had flown\nthrough her worried mind--\n\n\"'T ain't no sin--_white_ folks has done it! It ain't no sin, glory to\ngoodness it ain't no sin! _Dey's_ done it--yes, en dey was de biggest\nquality in de whole bilin', too--_kings!\"_\n\nShe began to muse; she was trying to gather out of her memory the dim\nparticulars of some tale she had heard some time or other. At last she\nsaid--\n\n\"Now I's got it; now I 'member. It was dat ole nigger preacher dat tole\nit, de time he come over here fum Illinois en preached in de nigger\nchurch. He said dey ain't nobody kin save his own self--can't do it by\nfaith, can't do it by works, can't do it no way at all. Free grace is de\n_on'y_ way, en dat don't come fum nobody but jis' de Lord; en _he_ kin\ngive it to anybody He please, saint or sinner--_he_ don't kyer. He do\njis' as He's a mineter. He s'lect out anybody dat suit Him, en put\nanother one in his place, and make de fust one happy forever en leave t'\nother one to burn wid Satan. De preacher said it was jist like dey done\nin Englan' one time, long time ago. De queen she lef' her baby layin'\naroun' one day, en went out callin'; an one 'o de niggers roun'bout de\nplace dat was 'mos' white, she come in en see de chile layin' aroun', en\ntuck en put her own chile's clo's on de queen's chile, en put de queen's\nchile's clo'es on her own chile, en den lef' her own chile layin' aroun',\nen tuck en toted de queen's chile home to de nigger quarter, en nobody\never foun' it out, en her chile was de king bimeby, en sole de queen's\nchile down de river one time when dey had to settle up de estate. Dah,\nnow--de preacher said it his own self, en it ain't no sin, 'ca'se white\nfolks done it. DEY done it--yes, DEY done it; en not on'y jis' common\nwhite folks nuther, but de biggest quality dey is in de whole bilin'.\n_Oh_, I's _so_ glad I 'member 'bout dat!\"\n\nShe got lighthearted and happy, and went to the cradles, and spent what\nwas left of the night \"practicing.\" She would give her own child a light\npat and say humbly, \"Lay still, Marse Tom,\" then give the real Tom a pat\nand say with severity, \"Lay _still_, Chambers! Does you want me to take\nsomep'n _to_ you?\"\n\nAs she progressed with her practice, she was surprised to see how\nsteadily and surely the awe which had kept her tongue reverent and her\nmanner humble toward her young master was transferring itself to her\nspeech and manner toward the usurper, and how similarly handy she was\nbecoming in transferring her motherly curtness of speech and\nperemptoriness of manner to the unlucky heir of the ancient house of\nDriscoll.\n\nShe took occasional rests from practicing, and absorbed herself in\ncalculating her chances.\n\n\"Dey'll sell dese niggers today fo' stealin' de money, den dey'll buy\nsome mo' dat don't now de chillen--so _dat's_ all right. When I takes de\nchillen out to git de air, de minute I's roun' de corner I's gwine to\ngaum dey mouths all roun' wid jam, den dey can't _nobody_ notice dey's\nchanged. Yes, I gwine ter do dat till I's safe, if it's a year.\n\n\"Dey ain't but one man dat I's afeard of, en dat's dat Pudd'nhead Wilson.\nDey calls him a pudd'nhead, en says he's a fool. My lan, dat man ain't\nno mo' fool den I is! He's de smartes' man in dis town, lessn' it's\nJedge Driscoll or maybe Pem Howard. Blame dat man, he worries me wid dem\nornery glasses o' his'n; _I_ b'lieve he's a witch. But nemmine, I's gwine\nto happen aroun' dah one o' dese days en let on dat I reckon he wants to\nprint a chillen's fingers ag'in; en if HE don't notice dey's changed, I\nbound dey ain't nobody gwine to notice it, en den I's safe, sho'. But I\nreckon I'll tote along a hoss-shoe to keep off de witch work.\"\n\nThe new Negros gave Roxy no trouble, of course. The master gave her\nnone, for one of his speculations was in jeopardy, and his mind was so\noccupied that he hardly saw the children when he looked at them, and all\nRoxy had to do was to get them both into a gale of laughter when he came\nabout; then their faces were mainly cavities exposing gums, and he was\ngone again before the spasm passed and the little creatures resumed a\nhuman aspect.\n\nWithin a few days the fate of the speculation became so dubious that Mr.\nPercy went away with his brother, the judge, to see what could be done\nwith it. It was a land speculation as usual, and it had gotten\ncomplicated with a lawsuit. The men were gone seven weeks. Before they\ngot back, Roxy had paid her visit to Wilson, and was satisfied. Wilson\ntook the fingerprints, labeled them with the names and with the date\n--October the first--put them carefully away, and continued his chat with\nRoxy, who seemed very anxious that he should admire the great advance in\nflesh and beauty which the babes had made since he took their\nfingerprints a month before. He complimented their improvement to her\ncontentment; and as they were without any disguise of jam or other stain,\nshe trembled all the while and was miserably frightened lest at any\nmoment he--\n\nBut he didn't. He discovered nothing; and she went home jubilant, and\ndropped all concern about the matter permanently out of her mind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 -- The Ways of the Changelings\n\n     _Adam and Eve had many advantages, but the principal one\n     was, that they escaped teething._ --Pudd'nhead Wilson's\n     Calendar\n\n     _There is this trouble about special providences--namely,\n     there is so often a doubt as to which party was intended to\n     be the beneficiary. In the case of the children, the bears,\n     and the prophet, the bears got more real satisfaction out of\n     the episode than the prophet did, because they got the\n     children._ --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n\nThis history must henceforth accommodate itself to the change which\nRoxana has consummated, and call the real heir \"Chambers\" and the\nusurping little slave, \"Thomas `a Becket\"--shortening this latter name to\n\"Tom,\" for daily use, as the people about him did.\n\n\"Tom\" was a bad baby, from the very beginning of his usurpation. He would\ncry for nothing; he would burst into storms of devilish temper without\nnotice, and let go scream after scream and squall after squall, then\nclimax the thing with \"holding his breath\"--that frightful specialty of\nthe teething nursling, in the throes of which the creature exhausts its\nlungs, then is convulsed with noiseless squirmings and twistings and\nkickings in the effort to get its breath, while the lips turn blue and\nthe mouth stands wide and rigid, offering for inspection one wee tooth\nset in the lower rim of a hoop of red gums; and when the appalling\nstillness has endured until one is sure the lost breath will never\nreturn, a nurse comes flying, and dashes water in the child's face,\nand--presto! the lungs fill, and instantly discharge a shriek, or a yell,\nor a howl which bursts the listening ear and surprises the owner of it\ninto saying words which would not go well with a halo if he had one. The\nbaby Tom would claw anybody who came within reach of his nails, and pound\nanybody he could reach with his rattle. He would scream for water until\nhe got it, and then throw cup and all on the floor and scream for more.\nHe was indulged in all his caprices, howsoever troublesome and\nexasperating they might be; he was allowed to eat anything he wanted,\nparticularly things that would give him the stomach-ache.\n\nWhen he got to be old enough to begin to toddle about and say broken\nwords and get an idea of what his hands were for, he was a more\nconsummate pest than ever. Roxy got no rest while he was awake. He would\ncall for anything and everything he saw, simply saying, \"Awnt it!\" (want\nit), which was a command. When it was brought, he said in a frenzy, and\nmotioning it away with his hands, \"Don't awnt it! don't awnt it!\" and the\nmoment it was gone he set up frantic yells of \"Awnt it! awnt it!\" and\nRoxy had to give wings to her heels to get that thing back to him again\nbefore he could get time to carry out his intention of going into\nconvulsions about it.\n\nWhat he preferred above all other things was the tongs. This was because\nhis \"father\" had forbidden him to have them lest he break windows and\nfurniture with them. The moment Roxy's back was turned he would toddle\nto the presence of the tongs and say, \"Like it!\" and cock his eye to one\nside or see if Roxy was observed; then, \"Awnt it!\" and cock his eye\nagain; then, \"Hab it!\" with another furtive glance; and finally, \"Take\nit!\"--and the prize was his. The next moment the heavy implement was\nraised aloft; the next, there was a crash and a squall, and the cat was\noff on three legs to meet an engagement; Roxy would arrive just as the\nlamp or a window went to irremediable smash.\n\nTom got all the petting, Chambers got none. Tom got all the delicacies,\nChambers got mush and milk, and clabber without sugar. In consequence\nTom was a sickly child and Chambers wasn't. Tom was \"fractious,\" as Roxy\ncalled it, and overbearing; Chambers was meek and docile.\n\nWith all her splendid common sense and practical everyday ability, Roxy\nwas a doting fool of a mother. She was this toward her child--and she\nwas also more than this: by the fiction created by herself, he was\nbecome her master; the necessity of recognizing this relation outwardly\nand of perfecting herself in the forms required to express the\nrecognition, had moved her to such diligence and faithfulness in\npracticing these forms that this exercise soon concreted itself into\nhabit; it became automatic and unconscious; then a natural result\nfollowed: deceptions intended solely for others gradually grew\npractically into self-deceptions as well; the mock reverence became real\nreverence, the mock homage real homage; the little counterfeit rift of\nseparation between imitation-slave and imitation-master widened and\nwidened, and became an abyss, and a very real one--and on one side of it\nstood Roxy, the dupe of her own deceptions, and on the other stood her\nchild, no longer a usurper to her, but her accepted and recognized\nmaster. He was her darling, her master, and her deity all in one, and in\nher worship of him she forgot who she was and what he had been.\n\nIn babyhood Tom cuffed and banged and scratched Chambers unrebuked, and\nChambers early learned that between meekly bearing it and resenting it,\nthe advantage all lay with the former policy. The few times that his\npersecutions had moved him beyond control and made him fight back had\ncost him very dear at headquarters; not at the hands of Roxy, for if she\never went beyond scolding him sharply for \"forgett'n' who his young\nmarster was,\" she at least never extended her punishment beyond a box on\nthe ear. No, Percy Driscoll was the person. He told Chambers that under\nno provocation whatever was he privileged to lift his hand against his\nlittle master. Chambers overstepped the line three times, and got three\nsuch convincing canings from the man who was his father and didn't know\nit, that he took Tom's cruelties in all humility after that, and made no\nmore experiments.\n\nOutside the house the two boys were together all through their boyhood.\nChambers was strong beyond his years, and a good fighter; strong because\nhe was coarsely fed and hard worked about the house, and a good fighter\nbecause Tom furnished him plenty of practice--on white boys whom he\nhated and was afraid of. Chambers was his constant bodyguard, to and\nfrom school; he was present on the playground at recess to protect his\ncharge. He fought himself into such a formidable reputation, by and by,\nthat Tom could have changed clothes with him, and \"ridden in peace,\" like\nSir Kay in Launcelot's armor.\n\nHe was good at games of skill, too. Tom staked him with marbles to play\n\"keeps\" with, and then took all the winnings away from him. In the winter\nseason Chambers was on hand, in Tom's worn-out clothes, with \"holy\" red\nmittens, and \"holy\" shoes, and pants \"holy\" at the knees and seat, to\ndrag a sled up the hill for Tom, warmly clad, to ride down on; but he\nnever got a ride himself. He built snowmen and snow fortifications under\nTom's directions. He was Tom's patient target when Tom wanted to do some\nsnowballing, but the target couldn't fire back. Chambers carried Tom's\nskates to the river and strapped them on him, then trotted around after\nhim on the ice, so as to be on hand when he wanted; but he wasn't ever\nasked to try the skates himself.\n\nIn summer the pet pastime of the boys of Dawson's Landing was to steal\napples, peaches, and melons from the farmer's fruit wagons--mainly on\naccount of the risk they ran of getting their heads laid open with the\nbutt of the farmer's whip. Tom was a distinguished adept at these\nthefts--by proxy. Chambers did his stealing, and got the peach stones,\napple cores, and melon rinds for his share.\n\nTom always made Chambers go in swimming with him, and stay by him as a\nprotection. When Tom had had enough, he would slip out and tie knots in\nChamber's shirt, dip the knots in the water and make them hard to undo,\nthen dress himself and sit by and laugh while the naked shiverer tugged\nat the stubborn knots with his teeth.\n\nTom did his humble comrade these various ill turns partly out of native\nviciousness, and partly because he hated him for his superiorities of\nphysique and pluck, and for his manifold cleverness. Tom couldn't dive,\nfor it gave him splitting headaches. Chambers could dive without\ninconvenience, and was fond of doing it. He excited so much admiration,\none day, among a crowd of white boys, by throwing back somersaults from\nthe stern of a canoe, that it wearied Tom's spirit, and at last he shoved\nthe canoe underneath Chambers while he was in the air--so he came down on\nhis head in the canoe bottom; and while he lay unconscious, several of\nTom's ancient adversaries saw that their long-desired opportunity was\ncome, and they gave the false heir such a drubbing that with Chamber's\nbest help he was hardly able to drag himself home afterward.\n\nWhen the boys was fifteen and upward, Tom was \"showing off\" in the river\none day, when he was taken with a cramp, and shouted for help. It was a\ncommon trick with the boys--particularly if a stranger was present--to\npretend a cramp and howl for help; then when the stranger came tearing\nhand over hand to the rescue, the howler would go on struggling and\nhowling till he was close at hand, then replace the howl with a sarcastic\nsmile and swim blandly away, while the town boys assailed the dupe with a\nvolley of jeers and laughter. Tom had never tried this joke as yet, but\nwas supposed to be trying it now, so the boys held warily back; but\nChambers believed his master was in earnest; therefore, he swam out, and\narrived in time, unfortunately, and saved his life.\n\nThis was the last feather. Tom had managed to endure everything else,\nbut to have to remain publicly and permanently under such an obligation\nas this to a nigger, and to this nigger of all niggers--this was too\nmuch. He heaped insults upon Chambers for \"pretending\" to think he was in\nearnest in calling for help, and said that anybody but a blockheaded\nnigger would have known he was funning and left him alone.\n\nTom's enemies were in strong force here, so they came out with their\nopinions quite freely. They laughed at him, and called him coward, liar,\nsneak, and other sorts of pet names, and told him they meant to call\nChambers by a new name after this, and make it common in the town--\"Tom\nDriscoll's nigger pappy,\"--to signify that he had had a second birth into\nthis life, and that Chambers was the author of his new being. Tom grew\nfrantic under these taunts, and shouted:\n\n\"Knock their heads off, Chambers! Knock their heads off! What do you\nstand there with your hands in your pockets for?\"\n\nChambers expostulated, and said, \"But, Marse Tom, dey's too many of\n'em--dey's--\"\n\n\"Do you hear me?\"\n\n\"Please, Marse Tom, don't make me! Dey's so many of 'em dat--\"\n\nTom sprang at him and drove his pocketknife into him two or three times\nbefore the boys could snatch him away and give the wounded lad a chance\nto escape. He was considerably hurt, but not seriously. If the blade had\nbeen a little longer, his career would have ended there.\n\nTom had long ago taught Roxy \"her place.\" It had been many a day now\nsince she had ventured a caress or a fondling epithet in his quarter.\nSuch things, from a \"nigger,\" were repulsive to him, and she had been\nwarned to keep her distance and remember who she was. She saw her\ndarling gradually cease from being her son, she saw THAT detail perish\nutterly; all that was left was master--master, pure and simple, and it\nwas not a gentle mastership, either. She saw herself sink from the\nsublime height of motherhood to the somber depths of unmodified slavery,\nthe abyss of separation between her and her boy was complete. She was\nmerely his chattel now, his convenience, his dog, his cringing and\nhelpless slave, the humble and unresisting victim of his capricious\ntemper and vicious nature.\n\nSometimes she could not go to sleep, even when worn out with fatigue,\nbecause her rage boiled so high over the day's experiences with her boy.\nShe would mumble and mutter to herself:\n\n\"He struck me en I warn't no way to blame--struck me in de face, right\nbefore folks. En he's al'ays callin' me nigger wench, en hussy, en all\ndem mean names, when I's doin' de very bes' I kin. Oh, Lord, I done so\nmuch for him--I lif' him away up to what he is--en dis is what I git for\nit.\"\n\nSometimes when some outrage of peculiar offensiveness stung her to the\nheart, she would plan schemes of vengeance and revel in the fancied\nspectacle of his exposure to the world as an imposter and a slave; but in\nthe midst of these joys fear would strike her; she had made him too\nstrong; she could prove nothing, and--heavens, she might get sold down\nthe river for her pains! So her schemes always went for nothing, and she\nlaid them aside in impotent rage against the fates, and against herself\nfor playing the fool on that fatal September day in not providing herself\nwith a witness for use in the day when such a thing might be needed for\nthe appeasing of her vengeance-hungry heart.\n\nAnd yet the moment Tom happened to be good to her, and kind--and this\noccurred every now and then--all her sore places were healed, and she was\nhappy; happy and proud, for this was her son, her nigger son, lording it\namong the whites and securely avenging their crimes against her race.\n\nThere were two grand funerals in Dawson's Landing that fall--the fall of\n1845. One was that of Colonel Cecil Burleigh Essex, the other that of\nPercy Driscoll.\n\nOn his deathbed Driscoll set Roxy free and delivered his idolized\nostensible son solemnly into the keeping of his brother, the judge, and\nhis wife. Those childless people were glad to get him. Childless people\nare not difficult to please.\n\nJudge Driscoll had gone privately to his brother, a month before, and\nbought Chambers. He had heard that Tom had been trying to get his father\nto sell the boy down the river, and he wanted to prevent the scandal--for\npublic sentiment did not approve of that way of treating family servants\nfor light cause or for no cause.\n\nPercy Driscoll had worn himself out in trying to save his great\nspeculative landed estate, and had died without succeeding. He was hardly\nin his grave before the boom collapsed and left his envied young devil of\nan heir a pauper. But that was nothing; his uncle told him he should be\nhis heir and have all his fortune when he died; so Tom was comforted.\n\nRoxy had no home now; so she resolved to go around and say good-by to her\nfriends and then clear out and see the world--that is to say, she would\ngo chambermaiding on a steamboat, the darling ambition of her race and\nsex.\n\nHer last call was on the black giant, Jasper. She found him chopping\nPudd'nhead Wilson's winter provision of wood.\n\nWilson was chatting with him when Roxy arrived. He asked her how she\ncould bear to go off chambermaiding and leave her boys; and chaffingly\noffered to copy off a series of their fingerprints, reaching up to their\ntwelfth year, for her to remember them by; but she sobered in a moment,\nwondering if he suspected anything; then she said she believed she didn't\nwant them. Wilson said to himself, \"The drop of black blood in her is\nsuperstitious; she thinks there's some devilry, some witch business about\nmy glass mystery somewhere; she used to come here with an old horseshoe\nin her hand; it could have been an accident, but I doubt it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 -- The Twins Thrill Dawson's Landing\n\n     _Training is everything. The peach was once a bitter almond;\n     cauliflower is nothing but cabbage with a college\n     education._ --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n     _Remark of Dr. Baldwin's, concerning upstarts: We don't care\n     to eat toadstools that think they are truffles._\n     --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n\nMrs. York Driscoll enjoyed two years of bliss with that prize,\nTom--bliss that was troubled a little at times, it is true, but bliss\nnevertheless; then she died, and her husband and his childless sister,\nMrs. Pratt, continued this bliss-business at the old stand. Tom was\npetted and indulged and spoiled to his entire content--or nearly that.\nThis went on till he was nineteen, then he was sent to Yale. He went\nhandsomely equipped with \"conditions,\" but otherwise he was not an object\nof distinction there. He remained at Yale two years, and then threw up\nthe struggle. He came home with his manners a good deal improved; he had\nlost his surliness and brusqueness, and was rather pleasantly soft and\nsmooth, now; he was furtively, and sometimes openly, ironical of speech,\nand given to gently touching people on the raw, but he did it with a\ngood-natured semiconscious air that carried it off safely, and kept him\nfrom getting into trouble. He was as indolent as ever and showed no very\nstrenuous desire to hunt up an occupation. People argued from this that\nhe preferred to be supported by his uncle until his uncle's shoes should\nbecome vacant. He brought back one or two new habits with him, one of\nwhich he rather openly practiced--tippling--but concealed another, which\nwas gambling. It would not do to gamble where his uncle could hear of\nit; he knew that quite well.\n\nTom's Eastern polish was not popular among the young people. They could\nhave endured it, perhaps, if Tom had stopped there; but he wore gloves,\nand that they couldn't stand, and wouldn't; so he was mainly without\nsociety. He brought home with him a suit of clothes of such exquisite\nstyle and cut in fashion--Eastern fashion, city fashion--that it filled\neverybody with anguish and was regarded as a peculiarly wanton affront.\nHe enjoyed the feeling which he was exciting, and paraded the town serene\nand happy all day; but the young fellows set a tailor to work that night,\nand when Tom started out on his parade next morning, he found the old\ndeformed Negro bell ringer straddling along in his wake tricked out in a\nflamboyant curtain-calico exaggeration of his finery, and imitating his\nfancy Eastern graces as well as he could.\n\nTom surrendered, and after that clothed himself in the local fashion. But\nthe dull country town was tiresome to him, since his acquaintanceship\nwith livelier regions, and it grew daily more and more so. He began to\nmake little trips to St. Louis for refreshment. There he found\ncompanionship to suit him, and pleasures to his taste, along with more\nfreedom, in some particulars, than he could have at home. So, during the\nnext two years, his visits to the city grew in frequency and his\ntarryings there grew steadily longer in duration.\n\nHe was getting into deep waters. He was taking chances, privately, which\nmight get him into trouble some day--in fact, _did_.\n\nJudge Driscoll had retired from the bench and from all business\nactivities in 1850, and had now been comfortably idle three years. He was\npresident of the Freethinkers' Society, and Pudd'nhead Wilson was the\nother member. The society's weekly discussions were now the old lawyer's\nmain interest in life. Pudd'nhead was still toiling in obscurity at the\nbottom of the ladder, under the blight of that unlucky remark which he\nhad let fall twenty-three years before about the dog.\n\nJudge Driscoll was his friend, and claimed that he had a mind above the\naverage, but that was regarded as one of the judge's whims, and it failed\nto modify the public opinion. Or rather, that was one of the reasons why\nit failed, but there was another and better one. If the judge had stopped\nwith bare assertion, it would have had a good deal of effect; but he made\nthe mistake of trying to prove his position. For some years Wilson had\nbeen privately at work on a whimsical almanac, for his amusement--a\ncalendar, with a little dab of ostensible philosophy, usually in ironical\nform, appended to each date; and the judge thought that these quips and\nfancies of Wilson's were neatly turned and cute; so he carried a handful\nof them around one day, and read them to some of the chief citizens. But\nirony was not for those people; their mental vision was not focused for\nit. They read those playful trifles in the solidest terms, and decided\nwithout hesitancy that if there had ever been any doubt that Dave Wilson\nwas a pudd'nhead--which there hadn't--this revelation removed that doubt\nfor good and all. That is just the way in this world; an enemy can partly\nruin a man, but it takes a good-natured injudicious friend to complete\nthe thing and make it perfect. After this the judge felt tenderer than\never toward Wilson, and surer than ever that his calendar had merit.\n\nJudge Driscoll could be a freethinker and still hold his place in society\nbecause he was the person of most consequence to the community, and\ntherefore could venture to go his own way and follow out his own notions.\nThe other member of his pet organization was allowed the like liberty\nbecause he was a cipher in the estimation of the public, and nobody\nattached any importance to what he thought or did. He was liked, he was\nwelcome enough all around, but he simply didn't count for anything.\n\nThe Widow Cooper--affectionately called \"Aunt Patsy\" by everybody--lived\nin a snug and comely cottage with her daughter Rowena, who was nineteen,\nromantic, amiable, and very pretty, but otherwise of no consequence.\nRowena had a couple of young brothers--also of no consequence.\n\nThe widow had a large spare room, which she let to a lodger, with board,\nwhen she could find one, but this room had been empty for a year now, to\nher sorrow. Her income was only sufficient for the family support, and\nshe needed the lodging money for trifling luxuries. But now, at last, on\na flaming June day, she found herself happy; her tedious wait was ended;\nher year-worn advertisement had been answered; and not by a village\napplicant, no, no!--this letter was from away off yonder in the dim great\nworld to the North; it was from St. Louis. She sat on her porch gazing\nout with unseeing eyes upon the shining reaches of the mighty\nMississippi, her thoughts steeped in her good fortune. Indeed it was\nspecially good fortune, for she was to have two lodgers instead of one.\n\nShe had read the letter to the family, and Rowena had danced away to see\nto the cleaning and airing of the room by the slave woman, Nancy, and the\nboys had rushed abroad in the town to spread the great news, for it was a\nmatter of public interest, and the public would wonder and not be pleased\nif not informed. Presently Rowena returned, all ablush with joyous\nexcitement, and begged for a rereading of the letter. It was framed thus:\n\nHONORED MADAM: My brother and I have seen your advertisement, by chance,\nand beg leave to take the room you offer. We are twenty-four years of\nage and twins. We are Italians by birth, but have lived long in the\nvarious countries of Europe, and several years in the United States. Our\nnames are Luigi and Angelo Capello. You desire but one guest; but, dear\nmadam, if you will allow us to pay for two, we will not incommode you.\nWe shall be down Thursday.\n\n\"Italians! How romantic! Just think, Ma--there's never been one in this\ntown, and everybody will be dying to see them, and they're all OURS!\nThink of that!\"\n\n\"Yes, I reckon they'll make a grand stir.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed they will. The whole town will be on its head!\nThink--they've been in Europe and everywhere! There's never been a\ntraveler in this town before, Ma, I shouldn't wonder if they've seen\nkings!\"\n\n\"Well, a body can't tell, but they'll make stir enough, without that.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's of course. Luigi--Angelo. They're lovely names; and so\ngrand and foreign--not like Jones and Robinson and such. Thursday they\nare coming, and this is only Tuesday; it's a cruel long time to wait.\nHere comes Judge Driscoll in at the gate. He's heard about it. I'll go\nand open the door.\"\n\nThe judge was full of congratulations and curiosity. The letter was read\nand discussed. Soon Justice Robinson arrived with more congratulations,\nand there was a new reading and a new discussion. This was the beginning.\nNeighbor after neighbor, of both sexes, followed, and the procession\ndrifted in and out all day and evening and all Wednesday and Thursday.\nThe letter was read and reread until it was nearly worn out; everybody\nadmired its courtly and gracious tone, and smooth and practiced style,\neverybody was sympathetic and excited, and the Coopers were steeped in\nhappiness all the while.\n\nThe boats were very uncertain in low water in these primitive times. This\ntime the Thursday boat had not arrived at ten at night--so the people\nhad waited at the landing all day for nothing; they were driven to their\nhomes by a heavy storm without having had a view of the illustrious\nforeigners.\n\nEleven o'clock came; and the Cooper house was the only one in the town\nthat still had lights burning. The rain and thunder were booming yet,\nand the anxious family were still waiting, still hoping. At last there\nwas a knock at the door, and the family jumped to open it. Two Negro men\nentered, each carrying a trunk, and proceeded upstairs toward the guest\nroom. Then entered the twins--the handsomest, the best dressed, the most\ndistinguished-looking pair of young fellows the West had ever seen. One\nwas a little fairer than the other, but otherwise they were exact\nduplicates.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6 -- Swimming in Glory\n\n     _Let us endeavor so to live that when we come to die even\n     the undertaker will be sorry._ --Pudd'nhead Wilson's\n     Calendar\n\n     _Habit is habit, and not to be flung out of the window by\n     any man, but coaxed downstairs a step at a time._\n     --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n\nAt breakfast in the morning, the twins' charm of manner and easy and\npolished bearing made speedy conquest of the family's good graces. All\nconstraint and formality quickly disappeared, and the friendliest feeling\nsucceeded. Aunt Patsy called them by their Christian names almost from\nthe beginning. She was full of the keenest curiosity about them, and\nshowed it; they responded by talking about themselves, which pleased her\ngreatly. It presently appeared that in their early youth they had known\npoverty and hardship. As the talk wandered along, the old lady watched\nfor the right place to drop in a question or two concerning that matter,\nand when she found it, she said to the blond twin, who was now doing the\nbiographies in his turn while the brunette one rested:\n\n\"If it ain't asking what I ought not to ask, Mr. Angelo, how did you come\nto be so friendless and in such trouble when you were little? Do you mind\ntelling? But don't, if you do.\"\n\n\"Oh, we don't mind it at all, madam; in our case it was merely\nmisfortune, and nobody's fault. Our parents were well to do, there in\nItaly, and we were their only child. We were of the old Florentine\nnobility\"--Rowena's heart gave a great bound, her nostrils expanded, and\na fine light played in her eyes--\"and when the war broke out, my father\nwas on the losing side and had to fly for his life. His estates were\nconfiscated, his personal property seized, and there we were, in Germany,\nstrangers, friendless, and in fact paupers. My brother and I were ten\nyears old, and well educated for that age, very studious, very fond of\nour books, and well grounded in the German, French, Spanish, and English\nlanguages. Also, we were marvelous musical prodigies--if you will allow\nme to say it, it being only the truth.\n\n\"Our father survived his misfortunes only a month, our mother soon\nfollowed him, and we were alone in the world. Our parents could have\nmade themselves comfortable by exhibiting us as a show, and they had many\nand large offers; but the thought revolted their pride, and they said\nthey would starve and die first. But what they wouldn't consent to do,\nwe had to do without the formality of consent. We were seized for the\ndebts occasioned by their illness and their funerals, and placed among\nthe attractions of a cheap museum in Berlin to earn the liquidation\nmoney. It took us two years to get out of that slavery. We traveled all\nabout Germany, receiving no wages, and not even our keep. We had to be\nexhibited for nothing, and beg our bread.\n\n\"Well, madam, the rest is not of much consequence. When we escaped from\nthat slavery at twelve years of age, we were in some respects men.\nExperience had taught us some valuable things; among others, how to take\ncare of ourselves, how to avoid and defeat sharks and sharpers, and how\nto conduct our own business for our own profit and without other people's\nhelp. We traveled everywhere--years and years--picking up smatterings\nof strange tongues, familiarizing ourselves with strange sights and\nstrange customs, accumulating an education of a wide and varied and\ncurious sort. It was a pleasant life. We went to Venice--to London,\nParis, Russia, India, China, Japan--\"\n\nAt this point Nancy, the slave woman, thrust her head in at the door and\nexclaimed:\n\n\"Ole Missus, de house is plum' jam full o' people, en dey's jes\na-spi'lin' to see de gen'lemen!\" She indicated the twins with a nod of\nher head, and tucked it back out of sight again.\n\nIt was a proud occasion for the widow, and she promised herself high\nsatisfaction in showing off her fine foreign birds before her neighbors\nand friends--simple folk who had hardly ever seen a foreigner of any\nkind, and never one of any distinction or style. Yet her feeling was\nmoderate indeed when contrasted with Rowena's. Rowena was in the clouds,\nshe walked on air; this was to be the greatest day, the most romantic\nepisode in the colorless history of that dull country town. She was to\nbe familiarly near the source of its glory and feel the full flood of it\npour over her and about her; the other girls could only gaze and envy,\nnot partake.\n\nThe widow was ready, Rowena was ready, so also were the foreigners.\n\nThe party moved along the hall, the twins in advance, and entered the\nopen parlor door, whence issued a low hum of conversation. The twins took\na position near the door, the widow stood at Luigi's side, Rowena stood\nbeside Angelo, and the march-past and the introductions began. The widow\nwas all smiles and contentment. She received the procession and passed\nit on to Rowena.\n\n\"Good mornin', Sister Cooper\"--handshake.\n\n\"Good morning, Brother Higgins--Count Luigi Capello, Mr. Higgins\"\n--handshake, followed by a devouring stare and \"I'm glad to see ye,\"\non the part of Higgins, and a courteous inclination of the head and a\npleasant \"Most happy!\" on the part of Count Luigi.\n\n\"Good mornin', Roweny\"--handshake.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Higgins--present you to Count Angelo Capello.\"\nHandshake, admiring stare, \"Glad to see ye\"--courteous nod, smily \"Most\nhappy!\" and Higgins passes on.\n\nNone of these visitors was at ease, but, being honest people, they didn't\npretend to be. None of them had ever seen a person bearing a title of\nnobility before, and none had been expecting to see one now, consequently\nthe title came upon them as a kind of pile-driving surprise and caught\nthem unprepared. A few tried to rise to the emergency, and got out an\nawkward \"My lord,\" or \"Your lordship,\" or something of that sort, but the\ngreat majority were overwhelmed by the unaccustomed word and its dim and\nawful associations with gilded courts and stately ceremony and anointed\nkingship, so they only fumbled through the handshake and passed on,\nspeechless. Now and then, as happens at all receptions everywhere, a\nmore than ordinary friendly soul blocked the procession and kept it\nwaiting while he inquired how the brothers liked the village, and how\nlong they were going to stay, and if their family was well, and dragged\nin the weather, and hoped it would get cooler soon, and all that sort of\nthing, so as to be able to say, when he got home, \"I had quite a long\ntalk with them\"; but nobody did or said anything of a regrettable kind,\nand so the great affair went through to the end in a creditable and\nsatisfactory fashion.\n\nGeneral conversation followed, and the twins drifted about from group to\ngroup, talking easily and fluently and winning approval, compelling\nadmiration and achieving favor from all. The widow followed their\nconquering march with a proud eye, and every now and then Rowena said to\nherself with deep satisfaction, \"And to think they are ours--all ours!\"\n\nThere were no idle moments for mother or daughter. Eager inquiries\nconcerning the twins were pouring into their enchanted ears all the time;\neach was the constant center of a group of breathless listeners; each\nrecognized that she knew now for the first time the real meaning of that\ngreat word Glory, and perceived the stupendous value of it, and\nunderstood why men in all ages had been willing to throw away meaner\nhappiness, treasure, life itself, to get a taste of its sublime and\nsupreme joy. Napoleon and all his kind stood accounted for--and\njustified.\n\nWhen Rowena had at last done all her duty by the people in the parlor,\nshe went upstairs to satisfy the longings of an overflow meeting there,\nfor the parlor was not big enough to hold all the comers. Again she was\nbesieged by eager questioners, and again she swam in sunset seas of\nglory. When the forenoon was nearly gone, she recognized with a pang\nthat this most splendid episode of her life was almost over, that nothing\ncould prolong it, that nothing quite its equal could ever fall to her\nfortune again. But never mind, it was sufficient unto itself, the grand\noccasion had moved on an ascending scale from the start, and was a noble\nand memorable success. If the twins could but do some crowning act now\nto climax it, something usual, something startling, something to\nconcentrate upon themselves the company's loftiest admiration, something\nin the nature of an electric surprise--\n\nHere a prodigious slam-banging broke out below, and everybody rushed down\nto see. It was the twins, knocking out a classic four-handed piece on\nthe piano in great style. Rowena was satisfied--satisfied down to the\nbottom of her heart.\n\nThe young strangers were kept long at the piano. The villagers were\nastonished and enchanted with the magnificence of their performance, and\ncould not bear to have them stop. All the music that they had ever heard\nbefore seemed spiritless prentice-work and barren of grace and charm when\ncompared with these intoxicating floods of melodious sound. They realized\nthat for once in their lives they were hearing masters.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7 -- The Unknown Nymph\n\n     _One of the most striking differences between a cat and a\n     lie is that a cat has only nine lives._ --Pudd'nhead\n     Wilson's Calendar\n\n\nThe company broke up reluctantly, and drifted toward their several\nhomes, chatting with vivacity and all agreeing that it would be many a\nlong day before Dawson's Landing would see the equal of this one again.\nThe twins had accepted several invitations while the reception was in\nprogress, and had also volunteered to play some duets at an amateur\nentertainment for the benefit of a local charity. Society was eager to\nreceive them to its bosom. Judge Driscoll had the good fortune to secure\nthem for an immediate drive, and to be the first to display them in\npublic. They entered his buggy with him and were paraded down the main\nstreet, everybody flocking to the windows and sidewalks to see.\n\nThe judge showed the strangers the new graveyard, and the jail, and where\nthe richest man lived, and the Freemasons' hall, and the Methodist\nchurch, and the Presbyterian church, and where the Baptist church was\ngoing to be when they got some money to build it with, and showed them\nthe town hall and the slaughterhouse, and got out the independent fire\ncompany in uniform and had them put out an imaginary fire; then he let\nthem inspect the muskets of the militia company, and poured out an\nexhaustless stream of enthusiasm over all these splendors, and seemed\nvery well satisfied with the responses he got, for the twins admired his\nadmiration, and paid him back the best they could, though they could have\ndone better if some fifteen or sixteen hundred thousand previous\nexperiences of this sort in various countries had not already rubbed off\na considerable part of the novelty in it.\n\nThe judge laid himself out hospitality to make them have a good time, and\nif there was a defect anywhere, it was not his fault. He told them a good\nmany humorous anecdotes, and always forgot the nub, but they were always\nable to furnish it, for these yarns were of a pretty early vintage, and\nthey had had many a rejuvenating pull at them before. And he told them\nall about his several dignities, and how he had held this and that and\nthe other place of honor or profit, and had once been to the legislature,\nand was now president of the Society of Freethinkers. He said the\nsociety had been in existence four years, and already had two members,\nand was firmly established. He would call for the brothers in the\nevening, if they would like to attend a meeting of it.\n\nAccordingly he called for them, and on the way he told them all about\nPudd'nhead Wilson, in order that they might get a favorable impression of\nhim in advance and be prepared to like him. This scheme succeeded--the\nfavorable impression was achieved. Later it was confirmed and solidified\nwhen Wilson proposed that out of courtesy to the strangers the usual\ntopics be put aside and the hour be devoted to conversation upon ordinary\nsubjects and the cultivation of friendly relations and good-fellowship--a\nproposition which was put to vote and carried.\n\nThe hour passed quickly away in lively talk, and when it was ended, the\nlonesome and neglected Wilson was richer by two friends than he had been\nwhen it began. He invited the twins to look in at his lodgings\npresently, after disposing of an intervening engagement, and they\naccepted with pleasure.\n\nToward the middle of the evening, they found themselves on the road to\nhis house. Pudd'nhead was at home waiting for them and putting in his\ntime puzzling over a thing which had come under his notice that morning.\nThe matter was this: He happened to be up very early--at dawn, in fact;\nand he crossed the hall, which divided his cottage through the center,\nand entered a room to get something there. The window of the room had no\ncurtains, for that side of the house had long been unoccupied, and\nthrough this window he caught sight of something which surprised and\ninterested him. It was a young woman--a young woman where properly no\nyoung woman belonged; for she was in Judge Driscoll's house, and in the\nbedroom over the judge's private study or sitting room. This was young\nTom Driscoll's bedroom. He and the judge, the judge's widowed sister Mrs.\nPratt, and three Negro servants were the only people who belonged in the\nhouse. Who, then, might this young lady be? The two houses were\nseparated by an ordinary yard, with a low fence running back through its\nmiddle from the street in front to the lane in the rear. The distance\nwas not great, and Wilson was able to see the girl very well, the window\nshades of the room she was in being up, and the window also. The girl had\non a neat and trim summer dress, patterned in broad stripes of pink and\nwhite, and her bonnet was equipped with a pink veil. She was practicing\nsteps, gaits and attitudes, apparently; she was doing the thing\ngracefully, and was very much absorbed in her work. Who could she be, and\nhow came she to be in young Tom Driscoll's room?\n\nWilson had quickly chosen a position from which he could watch the girl\nwithout running much risk of being seen by her, and he remained there\nhoping she would raise her veil and betray her face. But she\ndisappointed him. After a matter of twenty minutes she disappeared and\nalthough he stayed at his post half an hour longer, she came no more.\n\nToward noon he dropped in at the judge's and talked with Mrs. Pratt about\nthe great event of the day, the levee of the distinguished foreigners at\nAunt Patsy Cooper's. He asked after her nephew Tom, and she said he was\non his way home and that she was expecting him to arrive a little before\nnight, and added that she and the judge were gratified to gather from his\nletters that he was conducting himself very nicely and creditably--at\nwhich Wilson winked to himself privately. Wilson did not ask if there was\na newcomer in the house, but he asked questions that would have brought\nlight-throwing answers as to that matter if Mrs. Pratt had had any light\nto throw; so he went away satisfied that he knew of things that were\ngoing on in her house of which she herself was not aware.\n\nHe was now awaiting for the twins, and still puzzling over the problem of\nwho that girl might be, and how she happened to be in that young fellow's\nroom at daybreak in the morning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8 -- Marse Tom Tramples His Chance\n\n     _The holy passion of Friendship is of so sweet and steady\n     and loyal and enduring a nature that it will last through a\n     whole lifetime, if not asked to lend money._ --Pudd'nhead\n     Wilson's Calendar\n\n     _Consider well the proportions of things. It is better to be\n     a young June bug than an old bird of paradise._ --Pudd'nhead\n     Wilson's Calendar\n\n\nIt is necessary now to hunt up Roxy.\n\nAt the time she was set free and went away chambermaiding, she was\nthirty-five. She got a berth as second chambermaid on a Cincinnati boat\nin the New Orleans trade, the _Grand Mogul_. A couple of trips made her\nwonted and easygoing at the work, and infatuated her with the stir and\nadventure and independence of steamboat life. Then she was promoted and\nbecome head chambermaid. She was a favorite with the officers, and\nexceedingly proud of their joking and friendly way with her.\n\nDuring eight years she served three parts of the year on that boat, and\nthe winters on a Vicksburg packet. But now for two months, she had had\nrheumatism in her arms, and was obliged to let the washtub alone. So she\nresigned. But she was well fixed--rich, as she would have described it;\nfor she had lived a steady life, and had banked four dollars every month\nin New Orleans as a provision for her old age. She said in the start\nthat she had \"put shoes on one bar'footed nigger to tromple on her with,\"\nand that one mistake like that was enough; she would be independent of\nthe human race thenceforth forevermore if hard work and economy could\naccomplish it. When the boat touched the levee at New Orleans she bade\ngood-by to her comrades on the _Grand Mogul_ and moved her kit ashore.\n\nBut she was back in a hour. The bank had gone to smash and carried her\nfour hundred dollars with it. She was a pauper and homeless. Also\ndisabled bodily, at least for the present. The officers were full of\nsympathy for her in her trouble, and made up a little purse for her. She\nresolved to go to her birthplace; she had friends there among the Negros,\nand the unfortunate always help the unfortunate, she was well aware of\nthat; those lowly comrades of her youth would not let her starve.\n\nShe took the little local packet at Cairo, and now she was on the\nhomestretch. Time had worn away her bitterness against her son, and she\nwas able to think of him with serenity. She put the vile side of him out\nof her mind, and dwelt only on recollections of his occasional acts of\nkindness to her. She gilded and otherwise decorated these, and made them\nvery pleasant to contemplate. She began to long to see him. She would go\nand fawn upon him slavelike--for this would have to be her attitude, of\ncourse--and maybe she would find that time had modified him, and that he\nwould be glad to see his long-forgotten old nurse and treat her gently.\nThat would be lovely; that would make her forget her woes and her\npoverty.\n\nHer poverty! That thought inspired her to add another castle to her\ndream: maybe he would give her a trifle now and then--maybe a dollar,\nonce a month, say; any little thing like that would help, oh, ever so\nmuch.\n\nBy the time she reached Dawson's Landing, she was her old self again; her\nblues were gone, she was in high feather. She would get along, surely;\nthere were many kitchens where the servants would share their meals with\nher, and also steal sugar and apples and other dainties for her to carry\nhome--or give her a chance to pilfer them herself, which would answer\njust as well. And there was the church. She was a more rabid and devoted\nMethodist than ever, and her piety was no sham, but was strong and\nsincere. Yes, with plenty of creature comforts and her old place in the\namen corner in her possession again, she would be perfectly happy and at\npeace thenceforward to the end.\n\nShe went to Judge Driscoll's kitchen first of all. She was received\nthere in great form and with vast enthusiasm. Her wonderful travels, and\nthe strange countries she had seen, and the adventures she had had, made\nher a marvel and a heroine of romance. The Negros hung enchanted upon a\ngreat story of her experiences, interrupting her all along with eager\nquestions, with laughter, exclamations of delight, and expressions of\napplause; and she was obliged to confess to herself that if there was\nanything better in this world than steamboating, it was the glory to be\ngot by telling about it. The audience loaded her stomach with their\ndinners, and then stole the pantry bare to load up her basket.\n\nTom was in St. Louis. The servants said he had spent the best part of\nhis time there during the previous two years. Roxy came every day, and\nhad many talks about the family and its affairs. Once she asked why Tom\nwas away so much. The ostensible \"Chambers\" said:\n\n\"De fac' is, ole marster kin git along better when young marster's away\nden he kin when he's in de town; yes, en he love him better, too; so he\ngives him fifty dollahs a month--\"\n\n\"No, is dat so? Chambers, you's a-jokin', ain't you?\"\n\n\"'Clah to goodness I ain't, Mammy; Marse Tom tole me so his own self. But\nnemmine, 'tain't enough.\"\n\n\"My lan', what de reason 'tain't enough?\"\n\n\"Well, I's gwine to tell you, if you gimme a chanst, Mammy. De reason it\nain't enough is 'ca'se Marse Tom gambles.\"\n\nRoxy threw up her hands in astonishment, and Chambers went on:\n\n\"Ole marster found it out, 'ca'se he had to pay two hundred dollahs for\nMarse Tom's gamblin' debts, en dat's true, Mammy, jes as dead certain as\nyou's bawn.\"\n\n\"Two--hund'd dollahs! Why, what is you talkin' 'bout?\nTwo--hund'd--dollahs. Sakes alive, it's 'mos' enough to buy a tol'able\ngood secondhand nigger wid. En you ain't lyin', honey? You wouldn't lie\nto you' old Mammy?\"\n\n\"It's God's own truth, jes as I tell you--two hund'd dollahs--I wisht I\nmay never stir outen my tracks if it ain't so. En, oh, my lan', ole Marse\nwas jes a-hoppin'! He was b'ilin' mad, I tell you! He tuck 'n'\ndissenhurrit him.\"\n\n\"Disen_whiched_ him?\"\n\n\"Dissenhurrit him.\"\n\n\"What's dat? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Means he bu'sted de will.\"\n\n\"Bu's--ted de will! He wouldn't _ever_ treat him so! Take it back, you\nmis'able imitation nigger dat I bore in sorrow en tribbilation.\"\n\nRoxy's pet castle--an occasional dollar from Tom's pocket--was tumbling\nto ruin before her eyes. She could not abide such a disaster as that;\nshe couldn't endure the thought of it. Her remark amused Chambers.\n\n\"Yah-yah-yah! Jes listen to dat! If I's imitation, what is you? Bofe of\nus is imitation _white_--dat's what we is--en pow'ful good imitation,\ntoo. Yah-yah-yah! We don't 'mount to noth'n as imitation _niggers_; en\nas for--\"\n\n\"Shet up yo' foolin', 'fo' I knock you side de head, en tell me 'bout de\nwill. Tell me 'tain't bu'sted--do, honey, en I'll never forgit you.\"\n\n\"Well, _'tain't_--'ca'se dey's a new one made, en Marse Tom's all right\nag'in. But what is you in sich a sweat 'bout it for, Mammy? 'Tain't\nnone o' your business I don't reckon.\"\n\n\"'Tain't none o' my business? Whose business is it den, I'd like to\nknow? Wuz I his mother tell he was fifteen years old, or wusn't I?--you\nanswer me dat. En you speck I could see him turned out po' and ornery on\nde worl' en never care noth'n' 'bout it? I reckon if you'd ever be'n a\nmother yo'self, Valet de Chambers, you wouldn't talk sich foolishness as\ndat.\"\n\n\"Well, den, ole Marse forgive him en fixed up de will ag'in--do dat\nsatisfy you?\"\n\nYes, she was satisfied now, and quite happy and sentimental over it. She\nkept coming daily, and at last she was told that Tom had come home. She\nbegan to tremble with emotion, and straightway sent to beg him to let his\n\"po' ole nigger Mammy have jes one sight of him en die for joy.\"\n\nTom was stretched at his lazy ease on a sofa when Chambers brought the\npetition. Time had not modified his ancient detestation of the humble\ndrudge and protector of his boyhood; it was still bitter and\nuncompromising. He sat up and bent a severe gaze upon the face of the\nyoung fellow whose name he was unconsciously using and whose family\nrights he was enjoying. He maintained the gaze until the victim of it\nhad become satisfactorily pallid with terror, then he said:\n\n\"What does the old rip want with me?\"\n\nThe petition was meekly repeated.\n\n\"Who gave you permission to come and disturb me with the social\nattentions of niggers?\"\n\nTom had risen. The other young man was trembling now, visibly. He saw\nwhat was coming, and bent his head sideways, and put up his left arm to\nshield it. Tom rained cuffs upon the head and its shield, saying no\nword: the victim received each blow with a beseeching, \"Please, Marse\nTom!--oh, please, Marse Tom!\" Seven blows--then Tom said, \"Face the\ndoor--march!\" He followed behind with one, two, three solid kicks. The\nlast one helped the pure-white slave over the door-sill, and he limped\naway mopping his eyes with his old, ragged sleeve. Tom shouted after\nhim, \"Send her in!\"\n\nThen he flung himself panting on the sofa again, and rasped out the\nremark, \"He arrived just at the right moment; I was full to the brim with\nbitter thinkings, and nobody to take it out of. How refreshing it was!\nI feel better.\"\n\nTom's mother entered now, closing the door behind her, and approached her\nson with all the wheedling and supplication servilities that fear and\ninterest can impart to the words and attitudes of the born slave. She\nstopped a yard from her boy and made two or three admiring exclamations\nover his manly stature and general handsomeness, and Tom put an arm under\nhis head and hoisted a leg over the sofa back in order to look properly\nindifferent.\n\n\"My lan', how you is growed, honey! 'Clah to goodness, I wouldn't\na-knowed you, Marse Tom! 'Deed I wouldn't! Look at me good; does you\n'member old Roxy? Does you know yo' old nigger mammy, honey? Well now, I\nkin lay down en die in peace, 'ca'se I'se seed--\"\n\n\"Cut it short, Goddamn it, cut it short! What is it you want?\"\n\n\"You heah dat? Jes the same old Marse Tom, al'ays so gay and funnin' wid\nde ole mammy. I'uz jes as shore--\"\n\n\"Cut it short, I tell you, and get along! What do you want?\"\n\nThis was a bitter disappointment. Roxy had for so many days nourished\nand fondled and petted her notion that Tom would be glad to see his old\nnurse, and would make her proud and happy to the marrow with a cordial\nword or two, that it took two rebuffs to convince her that he was not\nfunning, and that her beautiful dream was a fond and foolish variety, a\nshabby and pitiful mistake. She was hurt to the heart, and so ashamed\nthat for a moment she did not quite know what to do or how to act. Then\nher breast began to heave, the tears came, and in her forlornness she was\nmoved to try that other dream of hers--an appeal to her boy's charity;\nand so, upon the impulse, and without reflection, she offered her\nsupplication:\n\n\"Oh, Marse Tom, de po' ole mammy is in sich hard luck dese days; en she's\nkinder crippled in de arms and can't work, en if you could gimme a\ndollah--on'y jes one little dol--\"\n\nTom was on his feet so suddenly that the supplicant was startled into a\njump herself.\n\n\"A dollar!--give you a dollar! I've a notion to strangle you! Is _that_\nyour errand here? Clear out! And be quick about it!\"\n\nRoxy backed slowly toward the door. When she was halfway she stopped,\nand said mournfully:\n\n\"Marse Tom, I nussed you when you was a little baby, en I raised you all\nby myself tell you was 'most a young man; en now you is young en rich, en\nI is po' en gitt'n ole, en I come heah b'leavin' dat you would he'p de\nole mammy 'long down de little road dat's lef' 'twix' her en de grave,\nen--\"\n\nTom relished this tune less than any that he had preceded it, for it\nbegan to wake up a sort of echo in his conscience; so he interrupted and\nsaid with decision, though without asperity, that he was not in a\nsituation to help her, and wasn't going to do it.\n\n\"Ain't you ever gwine to he'p me, Marse Tom?\"\n\n\"No! Now go away and don't bother me any more.\"\n\nRoxy's head was down, in an attitude of humility. But now the fires of\nher old wrongs flamed up in her breast and began to burn fiercely. She\nraised her head slowly, till it was well up, and at the same time her\ngreat frame unconsciously assumed an erect and masterful attitude, with\nall the majesty and grace of her vanished youth in it. She raised her\nfinger and punctuated with it.\n\n\"You has said de word. You has had yo' chance, en you has trompled it\nunder yo' foot. When you git another one, you'll git down on yo' knees\nen _beg_ for it!\"\n\nA cold chill went to Tom's heart, he didn't know why; for he did not\nreflect that such words, from such an incongruous source, and so solemnly\ndelivered, could not easily fail of that effect. However, he did the\nnatural thing: he replied with bluster and mockery.\n\n\"_You'll_ give me a chance--_you_! Perhaps I'd better get down on my\nknees now! But in case I don't--just for argument's sake--what's going\nto happen, pray?\"\n\n\"Dis is what is gwine to happen, I's gwine as straight to yo' uncle as I\nkin walk, en tell him every las' thing I knows 'bout you.\"\n\nTom's cheek blenched, and she saw it. Disturbing thoughts began to chase\neach other through his head. \"How can she know? And yet she must have\nfound out--she looks it. I've had the will back only three months, and\nam already deep in debt again, and moving heaven and earth to save myself\nfrom exposure and destruction, with a reasonably fair show of getting the\nthing covered up if I'm let alone, and now this fiend has gone and found\nme out somehow or other. I wonder how much she knows? Oh, oh, oh, it's\nenough to break a body's heart! But I've got to humor her--there's no\nother way.\"\n\nThen he worked up a rather sickly sample of a gay laugh and a hollow\nchipperness of manner, and said:\n\n\"Well, well, Roxy dear, old friends like you and me mustn't quarrel.\nHere's your dollar--now tell me what you know.\"\n\nHe held out the wildcat bill; she stood as she was, and made no movement.\nIt was her turn to scorn persuasive foolery now, and she did not waste\nit. She said, with a grim implacability in voice and manner which made\nTom almost realize that even a former slave can remember for ten minutes\ninsults and injuries returned for compliments and flatteries received,\nand can also enjoy taking revenge for them when the opportunity offers:\n\n\"What does I know? I'll tell you what I knows, I knows enough to bu'st\ndat will to flinders--en more, mind you, _more!_\"\n\nTom was aghast.\n\n\"More?\" he said, \"What do you call more? Where's there any room for\nmore?\"\n\nRoxy laughed a mocking laugh, and said scoffingly, with a toss of her\nhead, and her hands on her hips:\n\n\"Yes!--oh, I reckon! _co'se_ you'd like to know--wid yo' po' little ole\nrag dollah. What you reckon I's gwine to tell _you_ for?--you ain't got\nno money. I's gwine to tell yo' uncle--en I'll do it dis minute,\ntoo--he'll gimme FIVE dollahs for de news, en mighty glad, too.\"\n\nShe swung herself around disdainfully, and started away. Tom was in a\npanic. He seized her skirts, and implored her to wait. She turned and\nsaid, loftily:\n\n\"Look-a-heah, what 'uz it I tole you?\"\n\n\"You--you--I don't remember anything. What was it you told me?\"\n\n\"I tole you dat de next time I give you a chance you'd git down on yo'\nknees en beg for it.\"\n\nTom was stupefied for a moment. He was panting with excitement. Then he\nsaid:\n\n\"Oh, Roxy, you wouldn't require your young master to do such a horrible\nthing. You can't mean it.\"\n\n\"I'll let you know mighty quick whether I means it or not! You call me\nnames, en as good as spit on me when I comes here, po' en ornery en\n'umble, to praise you for bein' growed up so fine and handsome, en tell\nyou how I used to nuss you en tend you en watch you when you 'uz sick en\nhadn't no mother but me in de whole worl', en beg you to give de po' ole\nnigger a dollah for to get her som'n' to eat, en you call me\nnames--_names_, dad blame you! Yassir, I gives you jes one chance mo',\nand dat's _now_, en it las' on'y half a second--you hear?\"\n\nTom slumped to his knees and began to beg, saying:\n\n\"You see I'm begging, and it's honest begging, too! Now tell me, Roxy,\ntell me.\"\n\nThe heir of two centuries of unatoned insult and outrage looked down on\nhim and seemed to drink in deep draughts of satisfaction. Then she said:\n\n\"Fine nice young white gen'l'man kneelin' down to a nigger wench! I's\nwanted to see dat jes once befo' I's called. Now, Gabr'el, blow de hawn,\nI's ready . . . Git up!\"\n\nTom did it. He said, humbly:\n\n\"Now, Roxy, don't punish me any more. I deserved what I've got, but be\ngood and let me off with that. Don't go to uncle. Tell me--I'll give\nyou the five dollars.\"\n\n\"Yes, I bet you will; en you won't stop dah, nuther. But I ain't gwine\nto tell you heah--\"\n\n\"Good gracious, no!\"\n\n\"Is you 'feared o' de ha'nted house?\"\n\n\"N-no.\"\n\n\"Well, den, you come to de ha'nted house 'bout ten or 'leven tonight, en\nclimb up de ladder, 'ca'se de sta'rsteps is broke down, en you'll find\nme. I's a-roostin' in de ha'nted house 'ca'se I can't 'ford to roos'\nnowher's else.\" She started toward the door, but stopped and said,\n\"Gimme de dollah bill!\" He gave it to her. She examined it and said,\n\"H'm--like enough de bank's bu'sted.\" She started again, but halted\nagain. \"Has you got any whisky?\"\n\n\"Yes, a little.\"\n\n\"Fetch it!\"\n\nHe ran to his room overhead and brought down a bottle which was\ntwo-thirds full. She tilted it up and took a drink. Her eyes sparkled\nwith satisfaction, and she tucked the bottle under her shawl, saying,\n\"It's prime. I'll take it along.\"\n\nTom humbly held the door for her, and she marched out as grim and erect\nas a grenadier.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9 -- Tom Practices Sycophancy\n\n     _Why is it that we rejoice at a birth and grieve at a\n     funeral? It is because we are not the person involved._\n     --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n     _It is easy to find fault, if one has that disposition.\n     There was once a man who, not being able to find any other\n     fault with his coal, complained that there were too many\n     prehistoric toads in it._ --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n\nTom flung himself on the sofa, and put his throbbing head in his hands,\nand rested his elbows on his knees. He rocked himself back and forth and\nmoaned.\n\n\"I've knelt to a nigger wench!\" he muttered. \"I thought I had struck the\ndeepest depths of degradation before, but oh, dear, it was nothing to\nthis. . . . Well, there is one consolation, such as it is--I've struck\nbottom this time; there's nothing lower.\"\n\nBut that was a hasty conclusion.\n\nAt ten that night he climbed the ladder in the haunted house, pale, weak,\nand wretched. Roxy was standing in the door of one of the rooms,\nwaiting, for she had heard him.\n\nThis was a two-story log house which had acquired the reputation a few\nyears ago of being haunted, and that was the end of its usefulness.\nNobody would live in it afterward, or go near it by night, and most\npeople even gave it a wide berth in the daytime. As it had no\ncompetition, it was called _the_ haunted house. It was getting crazy and\nruinous now, from long neglect. It stood three hundred yards beyond\nPudd'nhead Wilson's house, with nothing between but vacancy. It was the\nlast house in the town at that end.\n\nTom followed Roxy into the room. She had a pile of clean straw in the\ncorner for a bed, some cheap but well-kept clothing was hanging on the\nwall, there was a tin lantern freckling the floor with little spots of\nlight, and there were various soap and candle boxes scattered about,\nwhich served for chairs. The two sat down. Roxy said:\n\n\"Now den, I'll tell you straight off, en I'll begin to k'leck de money\nlater on; I ain't in no hurry. What does you reckon I's gwine to tell\nyou?\"\n\n\"Well, you--you--oh, Roxy, don't make it too hard for me! Come right out\nand tell me you've found out somehow what a shape I'm in on account of\ndissipation and foolishness.\"\n\n\"Disposition en foolishness! NO sir, dat ain't it. Dat jist ain't\nnothin' at all, 'longside o' what _I_ knows.\"\n\nTom stared at her, and said:\n\n\"Why, Roxy, what do you mean?\"\n\nShe rose, and gloomed above him like a Fate.\n\n\"I means dis--en it's de Lord's truth. You ain't no more kin to ole\nMarse Driscoll den I is! _dat's_ what I means!\" and her eyes flamed\nwith triumph.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Yassir, en _dat_ ain't all! You's a _nigger!_--_bawn_ a nigger and a\n_slave!_--en you's a nigger en a slave dis minute; en if I opens my mouf\nole Marse Driscoll'll sell you down de river befo' you is two days older\nden what you is now!\"\n\n\"It's a thundering lie, you miserable old blatherskite!\"\n\n\"It ain't no lie, nuther. It's just de truth, en nothin' _but_ de truth,\nso he'p me. Yassir--you's my _son_--\"\n\n\"You devil!\"\n\n\"En dat po' boy dat you's be'n a-kickin' en a-cuffin' today is Percy\nDriscoll's son en yo' _marster_--\"\n\n\"You beast!\"\n\n\"En _his_ name is Tom Driscoll, en _yo's_ name's Valet de Chambers, en\nyou ain't GOT no fambly name, beca'se niggers don't _have_ em!\"\n\nTom sprang up and seized a billet of wood and raised it, but his mother\nonly laughed at him, and said:\n\n\"Set down, you pup! Does you think you kin skyer me? It ain't in you,\nnor de likes of you. I reckon you'd shoot me in de back, maybe, if you\ngot a chance, for dat's jist yo' style--_I_ knows you, throo en\nthroo--but I don't mind gitt'n killed, beca'se all dis is down in writin'\nand it's in safe hands, too, en de man dat's got it knows whah to look\nfor de right man when I gits killed. Oh, bless yo' soul, if you puts yo'\nmother up for as big a fool as _you_ is, you's pow'ful mistaken, I kin\ntell you! Now den, you set still en behave yo'self; en don't you git up\nag'in till I tell you!\"\n\nTom fretted and chafed awhile in a whirlwind of disorganizing sensations\nand emotions, and finally said, with something like settled conviction:\n\n\"The whole thing is moonshine; now then, go ahead and do your worst; I'm\ndone with you.\"\n\nRoxy made no answer. She took the lantern and started for the door. Tom\nwas in a cold panic in a moment.\n\n\"Come back, come back!\" he wailed. \"I didn't mean it, Roxy; I take it\nall back, and I'll never say it again! Please come back, Roxy!\"\n\nThe woman stood a moment, then she said gravely:\n\n\"Dat's one thing you's got to stop, Valet de Chambers. You can't call me\n_Roxy_, same as if you was my equal. Chillen don't speak to dey mammies\nlike dat. You'll call me ma or mammy, dat's what you'll call\nme--leastways when de ain't nobody aroun'. _Say_ it!\"\n\nIt cost Tom a struggle, but he got it out.\n\n\"Dat's all right, don't you ever forgit it ag'in, if you knows what's\ngood for you. Now den, you had said you wouldn't ever call it lies en\nmoonshine ag'in. I'll tell you dis, for a warnin': if you ever does say\nit ag'in, it's de LAS' time you'll ever say it to me; I'll tramp as\nstraight to de judge as I kin walk, en tell him who you is, en _prove_\nit. Does you b'lieve me when I says dat?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" groaned Tom, \"I more than believe it; I _know_ it.\"\n\nRoxy knew her conquest was complete. She could have proved nothing to\nanybody, and her threat of writings was a lie; but she knew the person\nshe was dealing with, and had made both statements without any doubt as\nto the effect they would produce.\n\nShe went and sat down on her candle box, and the pride and pomp of her\nvictorious attitude made it a throne. She said:\n\n\"Now den, Chambers, we's gwine to talk business, en dey ain't gwine to be\nno mo' foolishness. In de fust place, you gits fifty dollahs a month;\nyou's gwine to han' over half of it to yo' ma. Plank it out!\"\n\nBut Tom had only six dollars in the world. He gave her that, and\npromised to start fair on next month's pension.\n\n\"Chambers, how much is you in debt?\"\n\nTom shuddered, and said:\n\n\"Nearly three hundred dollars.\"\n\n\"How is you gwine to pay it?\"\n\nTom groaned out: \"Oh, I don't know; don't ask me such awful questions.\"\n\nBut she stuck to her point until she wearied a confession out of him: he\nhad been prowling about in disguise, stealing small valuables from\nprivate houses; in fact, he made a good deal of a raid on his fellow\nvillagers a fortnight before, when he was supposed to be in St. Louis;\nbut he doubted if he had sent away enough stuff to realize the required\namount, and was afraid to make a further venture in the present excited\nstate of the town. His mother approved of his conduct, and offered to\nhelp, but this frightened him. He tremblingly ventured to say that if\nshe would retire from the town he should feel better and safer, and could\nhold his head higher--and was going on to make an argument, but she\ninterrupted and surprised him pleasantly by saying she was ready; it\ndidn't make any difference to her where she stayed, so that she got her\nshare of the pension regularly. She said she would not go far, and would\ncall at the haunted house once a month for her money. Then she said:\n\n\"I don't hate you so much now, but I've hated you a many a year--and\nanybody would. Didn't I change you off, en give you a good fambly en a\ngood name, en made you a white gen'l'man en rich, wid store clothes\non--en what did I git for it? You despised me all de time, en was al'ays\nsayin' mean hard things to me befo' folks, en wouldn't ever let me forgit\nI's a nigger--en--en--\"\n\nShe fell to sobbing, and broke down. Tom said: \"But you know I didn't\nknow you were my mother; and besides--\"\n\n\"Well, nemmine 'bout dat, now; let it go. I's gwine to fo'git it.\" Then\nshe added fiercely, \"En don't ever make me remember it ag'in, or you'll\nbe sorry, _I_ tell you.\"\n\nWhen they were parting, Tom said, in the most persuasive way he could\ncommand:\n\n\"Ma, would you mind telling me who was my father?\"\n\nHe had supposed he was asking an embarrassing question. He was mistaken.\nRoxy drew herself up with a proud toss of her head, and said:\n\n\"Does I mine tellin' you? No, dat I don't! You ain't got no 'casion to\nbe shame' o' yo' father, _I_ kin tell you. He wuz de highest quality in\ndis whole town--ole Virginny stock. Fust famblies, he wuz. Jes as good\nstock as de Driscolls en de Howards, de bes' day dey ever seed.\" She put\non a little prouder air, if possible, and added impressively: \"Does you\n'member Cunnel Cecil Burleigh Essex, dat died de same year yo' young\nMarse Tom Driscoll's pappy died, en all de Masons en Odd Fellers en\nChurches turned out en give him de bigges' funeral dis town ever seed?\nDat's de man.\"\n\nUnder the inspiration of her soaring complacency the departed graces of\nher earlier days returned to her, and her bearing took to itself a\ndignity and state that might have passed for queenly if her surroundings\nhad been a little more in keeping with it.\n\n\"Dey ain't another nigger in dis town dat's as highbawn as you is. Now\nden, go 'long! En jes you hold yo' head up as high as you want to--you\nhas de right, en dat I kin swah.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10 -- The Nymph Revealed\n\n     _All say, \"How hard it is that we have to die\"--a strange\n     complaint to come from the mouths of people who have had to\n     live._ --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n     _When angry, count four; when very angry, swear._\n     --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n\nEvery now and then, after Tom went to bed, he had sudden wakings out of\nhis sleep, and his first thought was, \"Oh, joy, it was all a dream!\"\nThen he laid himself heavily down again, with a groan and the muttered\nwords, \"A nigger! I am a nigger! Oh, I wish I was dead!\"\n\nHe woke at dawn with one more repetition of this horror, and then he\nresolved to meddle no more with that treacherous sleep. He began to\nthink. Sufficiently bitter thinkings they were. They wandered along\nsomething after this fashion:\n\n\"Why were niggers _and_ whites made? What crime did the uncreated first\nnigger commit that the curse of birth was decreed for him? And why is\nthis awful difference made between white and black? . . . How hard the\nnigger's fate seems, this morning!--yet until last night such a thought\nnever entered my head.\"\n\nHe sighed and groaned an hour or more away. Then \"Chambers\" came humbly\nin to say that breakfast was nearly ready. \"Tom\" blushed scarlet to see\nthis aristocratic white youth cringe to him, a nigger, and call him\n\"Young Marster.\" He said roughly:\n\n\"Get out of my sight!\" and when the youth was gone, he muttered, \"He has\ndone me no harm, poor wretch, but he is an eyesore to me now, for he is\nDriscoll, the young gentleman, and I am a--oh, I wish I was dead!\"\n\nA gigantic eruption, like that of Krakatoa a few years ago, with the\naccompanying earthquakes, tidal waves, and clouds of volcanic dust,\nchanges the face of the surrounding landscape beyond recognition,\nbringing down the high lands, elevating the low, making fair lakes where\ndeserts had been, and deserts where green prairies had smiled before.\nThe tremendous catastrophe which had befallen Tom had changed his moral\nlandscape in much the same way. Some of his low places he found lifted to\nideals, some of his ideas had sunk to the valleys, and lay there with the\nsackcloth and ashes of pumice stone and sulphur on their ruined heads.\n\nFor days he wandered in lonely places, thinking, thinking, thinking\n--trying to get his bearings. It was new work. If he met a friend, he\nfound that the habit of a lifetime had in some mysterious way vanished\n--his arm hung limp, instead of involuntarily extending the hand for a\nshake. It was the \"nigger\" in him asserting its humility, and he blushed\nand was abashed. And the \"nigger\" in him was surprised when the white\nfriend put out his hand for a shake with him. He found the \"nigger\" in\nhim involuntarily giving the road, on the sidewalk, to a white rowdy and\nloafer. When Rowena, the dearest thing his heart knew, the idol of his\nsecret worship, invited him in, the \"nigger\" in him made an embarrassed\nexcuse and was afraid to enter and sit with the dread white folks on\nequal terms. The \"nigger\" in him went shrinking and skulking here and\nthere and yonder, and fancying it saw suspicion and maybe detection in\nall faces, tones, and gestures. So strange and uncharacteristic was\nTom's conduct that people noticed it, and turned to look after him when\nhe passed on; and when he glanced back--as he could not help doing, in\nspite of his best resistance--and caught that puzzled expression in a\nperson's face, it gave him a sick feeling, and he took himself out of\nview as quickly as he could. He presently came to have a hunted sense\nand a hunted look, and then he fled away to the hilltops and the\nsolitudes. He said to himself that the curse of Ham was upon him.\n\nHe dreaded his meals; the \"nigger\" in him was ashamed to sit at the white\nfolk's table, and feared discovery all the time; and once when Judge\nDriscoll said, \"What's the matter with you? You look as meek as a\nnigger,\" he felt as secret murderers are said to feel when the accuser\nsays, \"Thou art the man!\" Tom said he was not well, and left the table.\n\nHis ostensible \"aunt's\" solicitudes and endearments were become a terror\nto him, and he avoided them.\n\nAnd all the time, hatred of his ostensible \"uncle\" was steadily growing\nin his heart; for he said to himself, \"He is white; and I am his chattel,\nhis property, his goods, and he can sell me, just as he could his dog.\"\n\nFor as much as a week after this, Tom imagined that his character had\nundergone a pretty radical change. But that was because he did not know\nhimself.\n\nIn several ways his opinions were totally changed, and would never go\nback to what they were before, but the main structure of his character\nwas not changed, and could not be changed. One or two very important\nfeatures of it were altered, and in time effects would result from this,\nif opportunity offered--effects of a quite serious nature, too. Under the\ninfluence of a great mental and moral upheaval, his character and his\nhabits had taken on the appearance of complete change, but after a while\nwith the subsidence of the storm, both began to settle toward their\nformer places. He dropped gradually back into his old frivolous and\neasygoing ways and conditions of feeling and manner of speech, and no\nfamiliar of his could have detected anything in him that differentiated\nhim from the weak and careless Tom of other days.\n\nThe theft raid which he had made upon the village turned out better than\nhe had ventured to hope. It produced the sum necessary to pay his gaming\ndebts, and saved him from exposure to his uncle and another smashing of\nthe will. He and his mother learned to like each other fairly well. She\ncouldn't love him, as yet, because there \"warn't nothing _to_ him,\" as\nshe expressed it, but her nature needed something or somebody to rule\nover, and he was better than nothing. Her strong character and\naggressive and commanding ways compelled Tom's admiration in spite of the\nfact that he got more illustrations of them than he needed for his\ncomfort. However, as a rule her conversation was made up of racy tales\nabout the privacies of the chief families of the town (for she went\nharvesting among their kitchens every time she came to the village), and\nTom enjoyed this. It was just in his line. She always collected her\nhalf of his pension punctually, and he was always at the haunted house to\nhave a chat with her on these occasions. Every now and then, she paid\nhim a visit there on between-days also.\n\nOccasions he would run up to St. Louis for a few weeks, and at last\ntemptation caught him again. He won a lot of money, but lost it, and\nwith it a deal more besides, which he promised to raise as soon as\npossible.\n\nFor this purpose he projected a new raid on his town. He never meddled\nwith any other town, for he was afraid to venture into houses whose ins\nand outs he did not know and the habits of whose households he was not\nacquainted with. He arrived at the haunted house in disguise on the\nWednesday before the advent of the twins--after writing his Aunt Pratt\nthat he would not arrive until two days after--and laying in hiding there\nwith his mother until toward daylight Friday morning, when he went to his\nuncle's house and entered by the back way with his own key, and slipped\nup to his room where he could have the use of the mirror and toilet\narticles. He had a suit of girl's clothes with him in a bundle as a\ndisguise for his raid, and was wearing a suit of his mother's clothing,\nwith black gloves and veil. By dawn he was tricked out for his raid, but\nhe caught a glimpse of Pudd'nhead Wilson through the window over the way,\nand knew that Pudd'nhead had caught a glimpse of him. So he entertained\nWilson with some airs and graces and attitudes for a while, then stepped\nout of sight and resumed the other disguise, and by and by went down and\nout the back way and started downtown to reconnoiter the scene of his\nintended labors.\n\nBut he was ill at ease. He had changed back to Roxy's dress, with the\nstoop of age added to the disguise, so that Wilson would not bother\nhimself about a humble old women leaving a neighbor's house by the back\nway in the early morning, in case he was still spying. But supposing\nWilson had seen him leave, and had thought it suspicious, and had also\nfollowed him? The thought made Tom cold. He gave up the raid for the\nday, and hurried back to the haunted house by the obscurest route he\nknew. His mother was gone; but she came back, by and by, with the news of\nthe grand reception at Patsy Cooper's, and soon persuaded him that the\nopportunity was like a special Providence, it was so inviting and\nperfect. So he went raiding, after all, and made a nice success of it\nwhile everybody was gone to Patsy Cooper's. Success gave him nerve and\neven actual intrepidity; insomuch, indeed, that after he had conveyed his\nharvest to his mother in a back alley, he went to the reception himself,\nand added several of the valuables of that house to his takings.\n\nAfter this long digression we have now arrived once more at the point\nwhere Pudd'nhead Wilson, while waiting for the arrival of the twins on\nthat same Friday evening, sat puzzling over the strange apparition of\nthat morning--a girl in young Tom Driscoll's bedroom; fretting, and\nguessing, and puzzling over it, and wondering who the shameless creature\nmight be.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11 -- Pudd'nhead's Thrilling Discovery\n\n     _There are three infallible ways of pleasing an author, and\n     the three form a rising scale of compliment: 1--to tell him\n     you have read one of his books; 2--to tell him you have read\n     all of his books; 3--to ask him to let you read the\n     manuscript of his forthcoming book. No. 1 admits you to his\n     respect; No. 2 admits you to his admiration; No. 3 carries\n     you clear into his heart._ --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n     _As to the Adjective: when in doubt, strike it out._\n     --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n\nThe twins arrived presently, and talk began. It flowed along chattily\nand sociably, and under its influence the new friendship gathered ease\nand strength. Wilson got out his Calendar, by request, and read a\npassage or two from it, which the twins praised quite cordially. This\npleased the author so much that he complied gladly when they asked him to\nlend them a batch of the work to read at home. In the course of their\nwide travels, they had found out that there are three sure ways of\npleasing an author; they were now working the best of the three.\n\nThere was an interruption now. Young Driscoll appeared, and joined the\nparty. He pretended to be seeing the distinguished strangers for the\nfirst time when they rose to shake hands; but this was only a blind, as\nhe had already had a glimpse of them, at the reception, while robbing the\nhouse. The twins made mental note that he was smooth-faced and rather\nhandsome, and smooth and undulatory in his movements--graceful, in fact.\nAngelo thought he had a good eye; Luigi thought there was something\nveiled and sly about it. Angelo thought he had a pleasant free-and-easy\nway of talking; Luigi thought it was more so than was agreeable. Angelo\nthought he was a sufficiently nice young man; Luigi reserved his\ndecision. Tom's first contribution to the conversation was a question\nwhich he had put to Wilson a hundred times before. It was always cheerily\nand good-natured put, and always inflicted a little pang, for it touched\na secret sore; but this time the pang was sharp, since strangers were\npresent.\n\n\"Well, how does the law come on? Had a case yet?\"\n\nWilson bit his lip, but answered, \"No--not yet,\" with as much\nindifference as he could assume. Judge Driscoll had generously left the\nlaw feature out of Wilson's biography which he had furnished to the\ntwins. Young Tom laughed pleasantly, and said:\n\n\"Wilson's a lawyer, gentlemen, but he doesn't practice now.\"\n\nThe sarcasm bit, but Wilson kept himself under control, and said without\npassion:\n\n\"I don't practice, it is true. It is true that I have never had a case,\nand have had to earn a poor living for twenty years as an expert\naccountant in a town where I can't get a hold of a set of books to\nuntangle as often as I should like. But it is also true that I did\nmyself well for the practice of the law. By the time I was your age,\nTom, I had chosen a profession, and was soon competent to enter upon it.\"\nTom winced. \"I never got a chance to try my hand at it, and I may never\nget a chance; and yet if I ever do get it, I shall be found ready, for I\nhave kept up my law studies all these years.\"\n\n\"That's it; that's good grit! I like to see it. I've a notion to throw\nall my business your way. My business and your law practice ought to\nmake a pretty gay team, Dave,\" and the young fellow laughed again.\n\n\"If you will throw--\" Wilson had thought of the girl in Tom's bedroom,\nand was going to say, \"If you will throw the surreptitious and\ndisreputable part of your business my way, it may amount to something,\"\nbut thought better of it and said,\n\n\"However, this matter doesn't fit well in a general conversation.\"\n\n\"All right, we'll change the subject; I guess you were about to give me\nanother dig, anyway, so I'm willing to change. How's the Awful Mystery\nflourishing these days? Wilson's got a scheme for driving plain window\nglass panes out of the market by decorating it with greasy finger marks,\nand getting rich by selling it at famine prices to the crowned heads over\nin Europe to outfit their palaces with. Fetch it out, Dave.\"\n\nWilson brought three of his glass strips, and said:\n\n\"I get the subject to pass the fingers of his right hand through his hair,\nso as to get a little coating of the natural oil on them, and then press\nthe balls of them on the glass. A fine and delicate print of the lines\nin the skin results, and is permanent, if it doesn't come in contact with\nsomething able to rub it off. You begin, Tom.\"\n\n\"Why, I think you took my finger marks once or twice before.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you were a little boy the last time, only about twelve years\nold.\"\n\n\"That's so. Of course, I've changed entirely since then, and variety is\nwhat the crowned heads want, I guess.\"\n\nHe passed his fingers through his crop of short hair, and pressed them\none at a time on the glass. Angelo made a print of his fingers on\nanother glass, and Luigi followed with a third. Wilson marked the\nglasses with names and dates, and put them away. Tom gave one of his\nlittle laughs, and said:\n\n\"I thought I wouldn't say anything, but if variety is what you are after,\nyou have wasted a piece of glass. The hand print of one twin is the same\nas the hand print of the fellow twin.\"\n\n\"Well, it's done now, and I like to have them both, anyway,\" said Wilson,\nreturned to his place.\n\n\"But look here, Dave,\" said Tom, \"you used to tell people's fortunes, too,\nwhen you took their finger marks. Dave's just an all-round genius--a\ngenius of the first water, gentlemen; a great scientist running to seed\nhere in this village, a prophet with the kind of honor that prophets\ngenerally get at home--for here they don't give shucks for his\nscientifics, and they call his skull a notion factory--hey, Dave, ain't\nit so? But never mind, he'll make his mark someday--finger mark, you\nknow, he-he! But really, you want to let him take a shy at your palms\nonce; it's worth twice the price of admission or your money's returned at\nthe door. Why, he'll read your wrinkles as easy as a book, and not only\ntell you fifty or sixty things that's going to happen to you, but fifty\nor sixty thousand that ain't. Come, Dave, show the gentlemen what an\ninspired jack-at-all-science we've got in this town, and don't know it.\"\n\nWilson winced under this nagging and not very courteous chaff, and the\ntwins suffered with him and for him. They rightly judged, now, that the\nbest way to relieve him would be to take the thing in earnest and\ntreat it with respect, ignoring Tom's rather overdone raillery; so Luigi\nsaid:\n\n\"We have seen something of palmistry in our wanderings, and know very\nwell what astonishing things it can do. If it isn't a science, and one\nof the greatest of them too, I don't know what its other name ought to\nbe. In the Orient--\"\n\nTom looked surprised and incredulous. He said:\n\n\"That juggling a science? But really, you ain't serious, are you?\"\n\n\"Yes, entirely so. Four years ago we had our hands read out to us as if\nour plans had been covered with print.\"\n\n\"Well, do you mean to say there was actually anything in it?\" asked Tom,\nhis incredulity beginning to weaken a little.\n\n\"There was this much in it,\" said Angelo: \"what was told us of our\ncharacters was minutely exact--we could have not have bettered it\nourselves. Next, two or three memorable things that have happened to us\nwere laid bare--things which no one present but ourselves could have\nknown about.\"\n\n\"Why, it's rank sorcery!\" exclaimed Tom, who was now becoming very much\ninterested. \"And how did they make out with what was going to happen to\nyou in the future?\"\n\n\"On the whole, quite fairly,\" said Luigi. \"Two or three of the most\nstriking things foretold have happened since; much the most striking one\nof all happened within that same year. Some of the minor prophesies have\ncome true; some of the minor and some of the major ones have not been\nfulfilled yet, and of course may never be: still, I should be more\nsurprised if they failed to arrive than if they didn't.\"\n\nTom was entirely sobered, and profoundly impressed. He said,\napologetically:\n\n\"Dave, I wasn't meaning to belittle that science; I was only chaffing\n--chattering, I reckon I'd better say. I wish you would look at their\npalms. Come, won't you?\"\n\n\"Why certainly, if you want me to; but you know I've had no chance to\nbecome an expert, and don't claim to be one. When a past event is\nsomewhat prominently recorded in the palm, I can generally detect that,\nbut minor ones often escape me--not always, of course, but often--but I\nhaven't much confidence in myself when it comes to reading the future. I\nam talking as if palmistry was a daily study with me, but that is not so.\nI haven't examined half a dozen hands in the last half dozen years; you\nsee, the people got to joking about it, and I stopped to let the talk die\ndown. I'll tell you what we'll do, Count Luigi: I'll make a try at your\npast, and if I have any success there--no, on the whole, I'll let the\nfuture alone; that's really the affair of an expert.\"\n\nHe took Luigi's hand. Tom said:\n\n\"Wait--don't look yet, Dave! Count Luigi, here's paper and pencil. Set\ndown that thing that you said was the most striking one that was foretold\nto you, and happened less than a year afterward, and give it to me so I\ncan see if Dave finds it in your hand.\"\n\nLuigi wrote a line privately, and folded up the piece of paper, and\nhanded it to Tom, saying:\n\n\"I'll tell you when to look at it, if he finds it.\"\n\nWilson began to study Luigi's palm, tracing life lines, heart lines, head\nlines, and so on, and noting carefully their relations with the cobweb of\nfiner and more delicate marks and lines that enmeshed them on all sides;\nhe felt of the fleshy cushion at the base of the thumb and noted its\nshape; he felt of the fleshy side of the hand between the wrist and the\nbase of the little finger and noted its shape also; he painstakingly\nexamined the fingers, observing their form, proportions, and natural\nmanner of disposing themselves when in repose. All this process was\nwatched by the three spectators with absorbing interest, their heads bent\ntogether over Luigi's palm, and nobody disturbing the stillness with a\nword. Wilson now entered upon a close survey of the palm again, and his\nrevelations began.\n\nHe mapped out Luigi's character and disposition, his tastes, aversions,\nproclivities, ambitions, and eccentricities in a way which sometimes made\nLuigi wince and the others laugh, but both twins declared that the chart\nwas artistically drawn and was correct.\n\nNext, Wilson took up Luigi's history. He proceeded cautiously and with\nhesitation now, moving his finger slowly along the great lines of the\npalm, and now and then halting it at a \"star\" or some such landmark, and\nexamining that neighborhood minutely. He proclaimed one or two past\nevents, Luigi confirmed his correctness, and the search went on.\nPresently Wilson glanced up suddenly with a surprised expression.\n\n\"Here is a record of an incident which you would perhaps not wish me\nto--\"\n\n\"Bring it out,\" said Luigi, good-naturedly. \"I promise you sha'n't\nembarrass me.\"\n\nBut Wilson still hesitated, and did not seem quite to know what to do.\nThen he said:\n\n\"I think it is too delicate a matter to--to--I believe I would rather\nwrite it or whisper it to you, and let you decide for yourself whether\nyou want it talked out or not.\"\n\n\"That will answer,\" said Luigi. \"Write it.\"\n\nWilson wrote something on a slip of paper and handed it to Luigi, who\nread it to himself and said to Tom:\n\n\"Unfold your slip and read it, Mr. Driscoll.\"\n\nTom said:\n\n\"'IT WAS PROPHESIED THAT I WOULD KILL A MAN. IT CAME TRUE BEFORE THE\nYEAR WAS OUT.'\"\n\nTom added, \"Great Scott!\"\n\nLuigi handed Wilson's paper to Tom, and said:\n\n\"Now read this one.\"\n\nTom read:\n\n\"'YOU HAVE KILLED SOMEONE, BUT WHETHER MAN, WOMAN, OR CHILD, I DO NOT\nMAKE OUT.'\"\n\n\"Caesar's ghost!\" commented Tom, with astonishment. \"It beats anything\nthat was ever heard of! Why, a man's own hand is his deadliest enemy!\nJust think of that--a man's own hand keeps a record of the deepest and\nfatalest secrets of his life, and is treacherously ready to expose\nhimself to any black-magic stranger that comes along. But what do you\nlet a person look at your hand for, with that awful thing printed on it?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Luigi, reposefully, \"I don't mind it. I killed the man for\ngood reasons, and I don't regret it.\"\n\n\"What were the reasons?\"\n\n\"Well, he needed killing.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you why he did it, since he won't say himself,\" said Angelo,\nwarmly. \"He did it to save my life, that's what he did it for. So it was\na noble act, and not a thing to be hid in the dark.\"\n\n\"So it was, so it was,\" said Wilson. \"To do such a thing to save a\nbrother's life is a great and fine action.\"\n\n\"Now come,\" said Luigi, \"it is very pleasant to hear you say these\nthings, but for unselfishness, or heroism, or magnanimity, the\ncircumstances won't stand scrutiny. You overlook one detail; suppose I\nhadn't saved Angelo's life, what would have become of mine? If I had let\nthe man kill him, wouldn't he have killed me, too? I saved my own life,\nyou see.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is your way of talking,\" said Angelo, \"but I know you--I\ndon't believe you thought of yourself at all. I keep that weapon yet\nthat Luigi killed the man with, and I'll show it to you sometime. That\nincident makes it interesting, and it had a history before it came into\nLuigi's hands which adds to its interest. It was given to Luigi by a\ngreat Indian prince, the Gaikowar of Baroda, and it had been in his\nfamily two or three centuries. It killed a good many disagreeable people\nwho troubled the hearthstone at one time or another. It isn't much too\nlook at, except it isn't shaped like other knives, or dirks, or whatever\nit may be called--here, I'll draw it for you.\" He took a sheet of paper\nand made a rapid sketch. \"There it is--a broad and murderous blade, with\nedges like a razor for sharpness. The devices engraved on it are the\nciphers or names of its long line of possessors--I had Luigi's name added\nin Roman letters myself with our coat of arms, as you see. You notice\nwhat a curious handle the thing has. It is solid ivory, polished like a\nmirror, and is four or five inches long--round, and as thick as a large\nman's wrist, with the end squared off flat, for your thumb to rest on;\nfor you grasp it, with your thumb resting on the blunt end--so--and lift\nit along and strike downward. The Gaikowar showed us how the thing was\ndone when he gave it to Luigi, and before that night was ended, Luigi had\nused the knife, and the Gaikowar was a man short by reason of it. The\nsheath is magnificently ornamented with gems of great value. You will\nfind a sheath more worth looking at than the knife itself, of course.\"\n\nTom said to himself:\n\n\"It's lucky I came here. I would have sold that knife for a song; I\nsupposed the jewels were glass.\"\n\n\"But go on; don't stop,\" said Wilson. \"Our curiosity is up now, to hear\nabout the homicide. Tell us about that.\"\n\n\"Well, briefly, the knife was to blame for that, all around. A native\nservant slipped into our room in the palace in the night, to kill us and\nsteal the knife on account of the fortune encrusted on its sheath,\nwithout a doubt. Luigi had it under his pillow; we were in bed together.\nThere was a dim night-light burning. I was asleep, but Luigi was awake,\nand he thought he detected a vague form nearing the bed. He slipped the\nknife out of the sheath and was ready and unembarrassed by hampering\nbedclothes, for the weather was hot and we hadn't any. Suddenly that\nnative rose at the bedside, and bent over me with his right hand lifted\nand a dirk in it aimed at my throat; but Luigi grabbed his wrist, pulled\nhim downward, and drove his own knife into the man's neck. That is the\nwhole story.\"\n\nWilson and Tom drew deep breaths, and after some general chat about the\ntragedy, Pudd'nhead said, taking Tom's hand:\n\n\"Now, Tom, I've never had a look at your palms, as it happens; perhaps\nyou've got some little questionable privacies that need--hel-lo!\"\n\nTom had snatched away his hand, and was looking a good deal confused.\n\n\"Why, he's blushing!\" said Luigi.\n\nTom darted an ugly look at him, and said sharply:\n\n\"Well, if I am, it ain't because I'm a murderer!\" Luigi's dark face\nflushed, but before he could speak or move, Tom added with anxious haste:\n\"Oh, I beg a thousand pardons. I didn't mean that; it was out before I\nthought, and I'm very, very sorry--you must forgive me!\"\n\nWilson came to the rescue, and smoothed things down as well as he could;\nand in fact was entirely successful as far as the twins were concerned,\nfor they felt sorrier for the affront put upon him by his guest's\noutburst of ill manners than for the insult offered to Luigi. But the\nsuccess was not so pronounced with the offender. Tom tried to seem at\nhis ease, and he went through the motions fairly well, but at bottom he\nfelt resentful toward all the three witnesses of his exhibition; in fact,\nhe felt so annoyed at them for having witnessed it and noticed it that he\nalmost forgot to feel annoyed at himself for placing it before them.\nHowever, something presently happened which made him almost comfortable,\nand brought him nearly back to a state of charity and friendliness. This\nwas a little spat between the twins; not much of a spat, but still a\nspat; and before they got far with it, they were in a decided condition\nof irritation while pretending to be actuated by more respectable\nmotives. By his help the fire got warmed up to the blazing point, and he\nmight have had the happiness of seeing the flames show up in another\nmoment, but for the interruption of a knock on the door--an interruption\nwhich fretted him as much as it gratified Wilson. Wilson opened the\ndoor.\n\nThe visitor was a good-natured, ignorant, energetic middle-aged Irishman\nnamed John Buckstone, who was a great politician in a small way, and\nalways took a large share in public matters of every sort. One of the\ntown's chief excitements, just now, was over the matter of rum. There\nwas a strong rum party and a strong anti-rum party. Buckstone was\ntraining with the rum party, and he had been sent to hunt up the twins\nand invite them to attend a mass meeting of that faction. He delivered\nhis errand, and said the clans were already gathering in the big hall\nover the market house. Luigi accepted the invitation cordially. Angelo\nless cordially, since he disliked crowds, and did not drink the powerful\nintoxicants of America. In fact, he was even a teetotaler sometimes\n--when it was judicious to be one.\n\nThe twins left with Buckstone, and Tom Driscoll joined the company with\nthem uninvited.\n\nIn the distance, one could see a long wavering line of torches drifting\ndown the main street, and could hear the throbbing of the bass drum, the\nclash of cymbals, the squeaking of a fife or two, and the faint roar of\nremote hurrahs. The tail end of this procession was climbing the market\nhouse stairs when the twins arrived in its neighborhood; when they\nreached the hall, it was full of people, torches, smoke, noise, and\nenthusiasm. They were conducted to the platform by Buckstone--Tom\nDriscoll still following--and were delivered to the chairman in the midst\nof a prodigious explosion of welcome. When the noise had moderated a\nlittle, the chair proposed that \"our illustrious guests be at once\nelected, by complimentary acclamation, to membership in our ever-glorious\norganization, the paradise of the free and the perdition of the slave.\"\n\nThis eloquent discharge opened the floodgates of enthusiasm again, and\nthe election was carried with thundering unanimity. Then arose a storm\nof cries:\n\n\"Wet them down! Wet them down! Give them a drink!\"\n\nGlasses of whisky were handed to the twins. Luigi waves his aloft, then\nbrought it to his lips; but Angelo set his down. There was another storm\nof cries.\n\n\"What's the matter with the other one?\" \"What is the blond one going\nback on us for?\" \"Explain! Explain!\"\n\nThe chairman inquired, and then reported:\n\n\"We have made an unfortunate mistake, gentlemen. I find that the Count\nAngelo Capello is opposed to our creed--is a teetotaler, in fact, and was\nnot intending to apply for membership with us. He desires that we\nreconsider the vote by which he was elected. What is the pleasure of the\nhouse?\"\n\nThere was a general burst of laughter, plentifully accented with\nwhistlings and catcalls, but the energetic use of the gavel presently\nrestored something like order. Then a man spoke from the crowd, and said\nthat while he was very sorry that the mistake had been made, it would not\nbe possible to rectify it at the present meeting. According to the\nbylaws, it must go over to the next regular meeting for action. He would\nnot offer a motion, as none was required. He desired to apologize to the\ngentlemen in the name of the house, and begged to assure him that as far\nas it might lie in the power of the Sons of Liberty, his temporary\nmembership in the order would be made pleasant to him.\n\nThis speech was received with great applause, mixed with cries of:\n\n\"That's the talk!\" \"He's a good fellow, anyway, if he _is_ a teetotaler!\"\n\"Drink his health!\" \"Give him a rouser, and no heeltaps!\"\n\nGlasses were handed around, and everybody on the platform drank Angelo's\nhealth, while the house bellowed forth in song:\n\n\n      For he's a jolly good fel-low,\n      For he's a jolly good fel-low,\n      For he's a jolly good fe-el-low,\n      Which nobody can deny.\n\nTom Driscoll drank. It was his second glass, for he had drunk Angelo's\nthe moment that Angelo had set it down. The two drinks made him very\nmerry--almost idiotically so, and he began to take a most lively and\nprominent part in the proceedings, particularly in the music and catcalls\nand side remarks.\n\nThe chairman was still standing at the front, the twins at his side. The\nextraordinarily close resemblance of the brothers to each other suggested\na witticism to Tom Driscoll, and just as the chairman began a speech he\nskipped forward and said, with an air of tipsy confidence, to the\naudience:\n\n\"Boys, I move that he keeps still and lets this human philopena snip you\nout a speech.\"\n\nThe descriptive aptness of the phrase caught the house, and a mighty\nburst of laughter followed.\n\nLuigi's southern blood leaped to the boiling point in a moment under the\nsharp humiliation of this insult delivered in the presence of four\nhundred strangers. It was not in the young man's nature to let the\nmatter pass, or to delay the squaring of the account. He took a couple of\nstrides and halted behind the unsuspecting joker. Then he drew back and\ndelivered a kick of such titanic vigor that it lifted Tom clear over the\nfootlights and landed him on the heads of the front row of the Sons of\nLiberty.\n\nEven a sober person does not like to have a human being emptied on him\nwhen he is not doing any harm; a person who is not sober cannot endure\nsuch an attention at all. The nest of Sons of Liberty that Driscoll\nlanded in had not a sober bird in it; in fact there was probably not an\nentirely sober one in the auditorium. Driscoll was promptly and\nindignantly flung on the heads of Sons in the next row, and these Sons\npassed him on toward the rear, and then immediately began to pummel the\nfront row Sons who had passed him to them. This course was strictly\nfollowed by bench after bench as Driscoll traveled in his tumultuous and\nairy flight toward the door; so he left behind him an ever-lengthening\nwake of raging and plunging and fighting and swearing humanity. Down went\ngroup after group of torches, and presently above the deafening clatter\nof the gavel, roar of angry voices, and crash of succumbing benches, rose\nthe paralyzing cry of \"_fire!_\"\n\nThe fighting ceased instantly; the cursing ceased; for one distinctly\ndefined moment, there was a dead hush, a motionless calm, where the\ntempest had been; then with one impulse the multitude awoke to life and\nenergy again, and went surging and struggling and swaying, this way and\nthat, its outer edges melting away through windows and doors and\ngradually lessening the pressure and relieving the mass.\n\nThe fireboys were never on hand so suddenly before; for there was no\ndistance to go this time, their quarters being in the rear end of the\nmarket house, There was an engine company and a hook-and-ladder company.\nHalf of each was composed of rummies and the other half of anti-rummies,\nafter the moral and political share-and-share-alike fashion of the\nfrontier town of the period. Enough anti-rummies were loafing in quarters\nto man the engine and the ladders. In two minutes they had their red\nshirts and helmets on--they never stirred officially in unofficial\ncostume--and as the mass meeting overhead smashed through the long row of\nwindows and poured out upon the roof of the arcade, the deliverers were\nready for them with a powerful stream of water, which washed some of them\noff the roof and nearly drowned the rest. But water was preferable to\nfire, and still the stampede from the windows continued, and still the\npitiless drenching assailed it until the building was empty; then the\nfireboys mounted to the hall and flooded it with water enough to\nannihilate forty times as much fire as there was there; for a village\nfire company does not often get a chance to show off, and so when it does\nget a chance, it makes the most of it. Such citizens of that village as\nwere of a thoughtful and judicious temperament did not insure against\nfire; they insured against the fire company.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12 -- The Shame of Judge Driscoll\n\n     _Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear--not absence\n     of fear. Except a creature be part coward, it is not a\n     compliment to say it is brave; it is merely a loose\n     misapplication of the word. Consider the flea!--incomparably\n     the bravest of all the creatures of God, if ignorance of\n     fear were courage. Whether you are asleep or awake he will\n     attack you, caring nothing for the fact that in bulk and\n     strength you are to him as are the massed armies of the\n     earth to a sucking child; he lives both day and night and\n     all days and nights in the very lap of peril and the\n     immediate presence of death, and yet is no more afraid than\n     is the man who walks the streets of a city that was\n     threatened by an earthquake ten centuries before. When we\n     speak of Clive, Nelson, and Putnam as men who \"didn't know\n     what fear was,\" we ought always to add the flea--and put him\n     at the head of the procession._ --Pudd'nhead Wilson's\n     Calendar\n\n\nJudge Driscoll was in bed and asleep by ten o'clock on Friday night, and\nhe was up and gone a-fishing before daylight in the morning with his\nfriend Pembroke Howard. These two had been boys together in Virginia\nwhen that state still ranked as the chief and most imposing member of the\nUnion, and they still coupled the proud and affectionate adjective \"old\"\nwith her name when they spoke of her. In Missouri a recognized\nsuperiority attached to any person who hailed from Old Virginia; and this\nsuperiority was exalted to supremacy when a person of such nativity could\nalso prove descent from the First Families of that great commonwealth.\nThe Howards and Driscolls were of this aristocracy. In their eyes, it\nwas a nobility. It had its unwritten laws, and they were as clearly\ndefined and as strict as any that could be found among the printed\nstatutes of the land. The F.F.V. was born a gentleman; his highest duty in\nlife was to watch over that great inheritance and keep it unsmirched. He\nmust keep his honor spotless. Those laws were his chart; his course was\nmarked out on it; if he swerved from it by so much as half a point of the\ncompass, it meant shipwreck to his honor; that is to say, degradation\nfrom his rank as a gentleman. These laws required certain things of him\nwhich his religion might forbid: then his religion must yield--the laws\ncould not be relaxed to accommodate religions or anything else. Honor\nstood first; and the laws defined what it was and wherein it differed in\ncertain details from honor as defined by church creeds and by the social\nlaws and customs of some of the minor divisions of the globe that had got\ncrowded out when the sacred boundaries of Virginia were staked out.\n\nIf Judge Driscoll was the recognized first citizen of Dawson's Landing,\nPembroke Howard was easily its recognized second citizen. He was called\n\"the great lawyer\"--an earned title. He and Driscoll were of the same\nage--a year or two past sixty.\n\nAlthough Driscoll was a freethinker and Howard a strong and determined\nPresbyterian, their warm intimacy suffered no impairment in consequence.\nThey were men whose opinions were their own property and not subject to\nrevision and amendment, suggestion or criticism, by anybody, even their\nfriends.\n\nThe day's fishing finished, they came floating downstream in their skiff,\ntalking national politics and other high matters, and presently met a\nskiff coming up from town, with a man in it who said:\n\n\"I reckon you know one of the new twins gave your nephew a kicking last\nnight, Judge?\"\n\n\"Did WHAT?\"\n\n\"Gave him a kicking.\"\n\nThe old judge's lips paled, and his eyes began to flame. He choked with\nanger for a moment, then he got out what he was trying to say:\n\n\"Well--well--go on! Give me the details!\"\n\nThe man did it. At the finish the judge was silent a minute, turning\nover in his mind the shameful picture of Tom's flight over the\nfootlights; then he said, as if musing aloud,\n\n\"H'm--I don't understand it. I was asleep at home. He didn't wake me.\nThought he was competent to manage his affair without my help, I reckon.\"\nHis face lit up with pride and pleasure at that thought, and he said with\na cheery complacency, \"I like that--it's the true old blood--hey,\nPembroke?\"\n\nHoward smiled an iron smile, and nodded his head approvingly. Then the\nnews-bringer spoke again.\n\n\"But Tom beat the twin on the trial.\"\n\nThe judge looked at the man wonderingly, and said:\n\n\"The trial? What trial?\"\n\n\"Why, Tom had him up before Judge Robinson for assault and battery.\"\n\nThe old man shrank suddenly together like one who has received a death\nstroke. Howard sprang for him as he sank forward in a swoon, and took\nhim in his arms, and bedded him on his back in the boat. He sprinkled\nwater in his face, and said to the startled visitor:\n\n\"Go, now--don't let him come to and find you here. You see what an\neffect your heedless speech has had; you ought to have been more\nconsiderate than to blurt out such a cruel piece of slander as that.\"\n\n\"I'm right down sorry I did it now, Mr. Howard, and I wouldn't have done\nit if I had thought; but it ain't slander; it's perfectly true, just as I\ntold him.\"\n\nHe rowed away. Presently the old judge came out of his faint and looked\nup piteously into the sympathetic face that was bent over him.\n\n\"Say it ain't true, Pembroke; tell me it ain't true!\" he said in a weak\nvoice.\n\nThere was nothing weak in the deep organ tones that responded:\n\n\"You know it's a lie as well as I do, old friend. He is of the best\nblood of the Old Dominion.\"\n\n\"God bless you for saying it!\" said the old gentleman, fervently. \"Ah,\nPembroke, it was such a blow!\"\n\nHoward stayed by his friend, and saw him home, and entered the house with\nhim. It was dark, and past supper-time, but the judge was not thinking\nof supper; he was eager to hear the slander refuted from headquarters,\nand as eager to have Howard hear it, too. Tom was sent for, and he came\nimmediately. He was bruised and lame, and was not a happy-looking\nobject. His uncle made him sit down, and said:\n\n\"We have been hearing about your adventure, Tom, with a handsome lie\nadded for embellishment. Now pulverize that lie to dust! What measures\nhave you taken? How does the thing stand?\"\n\nTom answered guilelessly: \"It don't stand at all; it's all over. I had\nhim up in court and beat him. Pudd'nhead Wilson defended him--first\ncase he ever had, and lost it. The judge fined the miserable hound five\ndollars for the assault.\"\n\nHoward and the judge sprang to their feet with the opening sentence\n--why, neither knew; then they stood gazing vacantly at each other.\nHoward stood a moment, then sat mournfully down without saying anything.\nThe judge's wrath began to kindle, and he burst out:\n\n\"You cur! You scum! You vermin! Do you mean to tell me that blood of\nmy race has suffered a blow and crawled to a court of law about it?\nAnswer me!\"\n\nTom's head drooped, and he answered with an eloquent silence. His uncle\nstared at him with a mixed expression of amazement and shame and\nincredulity that was sorrowful to see. At last he said:\n\n\"Which of the twins was it?\"\n\n\"Count Luigi.\"\n\n\"You have challenged him?\"\n\n\"N--no,\" hesitated Tom, turning pale.\n\n\"You will challenge him tonight. Howard will carry it.\"\n\nTom began to turn sick, and to show it. He turned his hat round and\nround in his hand, his uncle glowering blacker and blacker upon him as\nthe heavy seconds drifted by; then at last he began to stammer, and said\npiteously:\n\n\"Oh, please, don't ask me to do it, uncle! He is a murderous devil--I\nnever could--I--I'm afraid of him!\"\n\nOld Driscoll's mouth opened and closed three times before he could get it\nto perform its office; then he stormed out:\n\n\"A coward in my family! A Driscoll a coward! Oh, what have I done to\ndeserve this infamy!\" He tottered to his secretary in the corner,\nrepeated that lament again and again in heartbreaking tones, and got out\nof a drawer a paper, which he slowly tore to bits, scattering the bits\nabsently in his track as he walked up and down the room, still grieving\nand lamenting. At last he said:\n\n\"There it is, shreds and fragments once more--my will. Once more you\nhave forced me to disinherit you, you base son of a most noble father!\nLeave my sight! Go--before I spit on you!\"\n\nThe young man did not tarry. Then the judge turned to Howard:\n\n\"You will be my second, old friend?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"There is pen and paper. Draft the cartel, and lose no time.\"\n\n\"The Count shall have it in his hands in fifteen minutes,\" said Howard.\n\nTom was very heavyhearted. His appetite was gone with his property and\nhis self-respect. He went out the back way and wandered down the obscure\nlane grieving, and wondering if any course of future conduct, however\ndiscreet and carefully perfected and watched over, could win back his\nuncle's favor and persuade him to reconstruct once more that generous\nwill which had just gone to ruin before his eyes. He finally concluded\nthat it could. He said to himself that he had accomplished this sort of\ntriumph once already, and that what had been done once could be done\nagain. He would set about it. He would bend every energy to the task,\nand he would score that triumph once more, cost what it might to his\nconvenience, limit as it might his frivolous and liberty-loving life.\n\n\"To begin,\" he says to himself, \"I'll square up with the proceeds of my\nraid, and then gambling has got to be stopped--and stopped short off.\nIt's the worst vice I've got--from my standpoint, anyway, because it's\nthe one he can most easily find out, through the impatience of my\ncreditors. He thought it expensive to have to pay two hundred dollars to\nthem for me once. Expensive--_that!_ Why, it cost me the whole of his\nfortune--but, of course, he never thought of that; some people can't\nthink of any but their own side of a case. If he had known how deep I am\nin now, the will would have gone to pot without waiting for a duel to\nhelp. Three hundred dollars! It's a pile! But he'll never hear of it,\nI'm thankful to say. The minute I've cleared it off, I'm safe; and I'll\nnever touch a card again. Anyway, I won't while he lives, I make oath to\nthat. I'm entering on my last reform--I know it--yes, and I'll win; but\nafter that, if I ever slip again I'm gone.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13 -- Tom Stares at Ruin\n\n     _When I reflect upon the number of disagreeable people who I\n     know have gone to a better world, I am moved to lead a\n     different life._ --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n     _October. This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to\n     speculate in stocks in. The others are July, January,\n     September, April, November, May, March, June, December,\n     August, and February._ --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n\nThus mournfully communing with himself, Tom moped along the lane past\nPudd'nhead Wilson's house, and still on and on between fences enclosing\nvacant country on each hand till he neared the haunted house, then he\ncame moping back again, with many sighs and heavy with trouble. He sorely\nwanted cheerful company. Rowena! His heart gave a bound at the thought,\nbut the next thought quieted it--the detested twins would be there.\n\nHe was on the inhabited side of Wilson's house, and now as he approached\nit, he noticed that the sitting room was lighted. This would do; others\nmade him feel unwelcome sometimes, but Wilson never failed in courtesy\ntoward him, and a kindly courtesy does at least save one's feelings, even\nif it is not professing to stand for a welcome. Wilson heard footsteps at\nhis threshold, then the clearing of a throat.\n\n\"It's that fickle-tempered, dissipated young goose--poor devil, he find\nfriends pretty scarce today, likely, after the disgrace of carrying a\npersonal assault case into a law-court.\"\n\nA dejected knock. \"Come in!\"\n\nTom entered, and dropped into a chair, without saying anything. Wilson\nsaid kindly:\n\n\"Why, my boy, you look desolate. Don't take it so hard. Try and forget\nyou have been kicked.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear,\" said Tom, wretchedly, \"it's not that, Pudd'nhead--it's not\nthat. It's a thousand times worse than that--oh, yes, a million times\nworse.\"\n\n\"Why, Tom, what do you mean? Has Rowena--\"\n\n\"Flung me? _No_, but the old man has.\"\n\nWilson said to himself, \"Aha!\" and thought of the mysterious girl in the\nbedroom. \"The Driscolls have been making discoveries!\" Then he said\naloud, gravely:\n\n\"Tom, there are some kinds of dissipation which--\"\n\n\"Oh, shucks, this hasn't got anything to do with dissipation. He wanted\nme to challenge that derned Italian savage, and I wouldn't do it.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course he would do that,\" said Wilson in a meditative\nmatter-of-course way, \"but the thing that puzzled me was, why he didn't\nlook to that last night, for one thing, and why he let you carry such a\nmatter into a court of law at all, either before the duel or after it.\nIt's no place for it. It was not like him. I couldn't understand it.\nHow did it happen?\"\n\n\"It happened because he didn't know anything about it. He was asleep\nwhen I got home last night.\"\n\n\"And you didn't wake him? Tom, is that possible?\"\n\nTom was not getting much comfort here. He fidgeted a moment, then said:\n\n\"I didn't choose to tell him--that's all. He was going a-fishing before\ndawn, with Pembroke Howard, and if I got the twins into the common\ncalaboose--and I thought sure I could--I never dreamed of their slipping\nout on a paltry fine for such an outrageous offense--well, once in the\ncalaboose they would be disgraced, and uncle wouldn't want any duels with\nthat sort of characters, and wouldn't allow any.\n\n\"Tom, I am ashamed of you! I don't see how you could treat your good old\nuncle so. I am a better friend of his than you are; for if I had known\nthe circumstances I would have kept that case out of court until I got\nword to him and let him have the gentleman's chance.\"\n\n\"You would?\" exclaimed Tom, with lively surprise. \"And it your first\ncase! And you know perfectly well there never would have _been_ any case\nif he had got that chance, don't you? And you'd have finished your days\na pauper nobody, instead of being an actually launched and recognized\nlawyer today. And you would really have done that, would you?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nTom looked at him a moment or two, then shook his head sorrowfully and\nsaid:\n\n\"I believe you--upon my word I do. I don't know why I do, but I do.\nPudd'nhead Wilson, I think you're the biggest fool I ever saw.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it.\"\n\n\"Well, he has been requiring you to fight the Italian, and you have\nrefused. You degenerate remnant of an honorable line! I'm thoroughly\nashamed of you, Tom!\"\n\n\"Oh, that's nothing! I don't care for anything, now that the will's torn\nup again.\"\n\n\"Tom, tell me squarely--didn't he find any fault with you for anything\nbut those two things--carrying the case into court and refusing to\nfight?\"\n\nHe watched the young fellow's face narrowly, but it was entirely\nreposeful, and so also was the voice that answered:\n\n\"No, he didn't find any other fault with me. If he had had any to find,\nhe would have begun yesterday, for he was just in the humor for it. He\ndrove that jack-pair around town and showed them the sights, and when he\ncame home he couldn't find his father's old silver watch that don't keep\ntime and he thinks so much of, and couldn't remember what he did with it\nthree or four days ago when he saw it last, and when I suggested that it\nprobably wasn't lost but stolen, it put him in a regular passion, and he\nsaid I was a fool--which convinced me, without any trouble, that that\nwas just what he was afraid _had_ happened, himself, but did not want to\nbelieve it, because lost things stand a better chance of being found\nagain than stolen ones.\"\n\n\"Whe-ew!\" whistled Wilson. \"Score another one the list.\"\n\n\"Another what?\"\n\n\"Another theft!\"\n\n\"Theft?\"\n\n\"Yes, theft. That watch isn't lost, it's stolen. There's been another\nraid on the town--and just the same old mysterious sort of thing that has\nhappened once before, as you remember.\"\n\n\"You don't mean it!\"\n\n\"It's as sure as you are born! Have you missed anything yourself?\"\n\n\"No. That is, I did miss a silver pencil case that Aunt Mary Pratt gave\nme last birthday--\"\n\n\"You'll find it stolen--that's what you'll find.\"\n\n\"No, I sha'n't; for when I suggested theft about the watch and got such a\nrap, I went and examined my room, and the pencil case was missing, but it\nwas only mislaid, and I found it again.\"\n\n\"You are sure you missed nothing else?\"\n\n\"Well, nothing of consequence. I missed a small plain gold ring worth\ntwo or three dollars, but that will turn up. I'll look again.\"\n\n\"In my opinion you'll not find it. There's been a raid, I tell you. Come\n_in!_\"\n\nMr. Justice Robinson entered, followed by Buckstone and the town\nconstable, Jim Blake. They sat down, and after some wandering and\naimless weather-conversation Wilson said:\n\n\"By the way, We've just added another to the list of thefts, maybe two.\nJudge Driscoll's old silver watch is gone, and Tom here has missed a gold\nring.\"\n\n\"Well, it is a bad business,\" said the justice, \"and gets worse the\nfurther it goes. The Hankses, the Dobsons, the Pilligrews, the Ortons,\nthe Grangers, the Hales, the Fullers, the Holcombs, in fact everybody\nthat lives around about Patsy Cooper's had been robbed of little things\nlike trinkets and teaspoons and suchlike small valuables that are easily\ncarried off. It's perfectly plain that the thief took advantage of the\nreception at Patsy Cooper's when all the neighbors were in her house and\nall their niggers hanging around her fence for a look at the show, to\nraid the vacant houses undisturbed. Patsy is miserable about it;\nmiserable on account of the neighbors, and particularly miserable on\naccount of her foreigners, of course; so miserable on their account that\nshe hasn't any room to worry about her own little losses.\"\n\n\"It's the same old raider,\" said Wilson. \"I suppose there isn't any\ndoubt about that.\"\n\n\"Constable Blake doesn't think so.\"\n\n\"No, you're wrong there,\" said Blake. \"The other times it was a man;\nthere was plenty of signs of that, as we know, in the profession, though\nwe never got hands on him; but this time it's a woman.\"\n\nWilson thought of the mysterious girl straight off. She was always in\nhis mind now. But she failed him again. Blake continued:\n\n\"She's a stoop-shouldered old woman with a covered basket on her arm, in\na black veil, dressed in mourning. I saw her going aboard the ferryboat\nyesterday. Lives in Illinois, I reckon; but I don't care where she\nlives, I'm going to get her--she can make herself sure of that.\"\n\n\"What makes you think she's the thief?\"\n\n\"Well, there ain't any other, for one thing; and for another, some nigger\ndraymen that happened to be driving along saw her coming out of or going\ninto houses, and told me so--and it just happens that they was _robbed_,\nevery time.\"\n\nIt was granted that this was plenty good enough circumstantial evidence.\nA pensive silence followed, which lasted some moments, then Wilson said:\n\n\"There's one good thing, anyway. She can't either pawn or sell Count\nLuigi's costly Indian dagger.\"\n\n\"My!\" said Tom. \"Is _that_ gone?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, that was a haul! But why can't she pawn it or sell it?\"\n\n\"Because when the twins went home from the Sons of Liberty meeting last\nnight, news of the raid was sifting in from everywhere, and Aunt Patsy\nwas in distress to know if they had lost anything. They found that the\ndagger was gone, and they notified the police and pawnbrokers everywhere.\nIt was a great haul, yes, but the old woman won't get anything out of it,\nbecause she'll get caught.\"\n\n\"Did they offer a reward?\" asked Buckstone.\n\n\"Yes, five hundred dollars for the knife, and five hundred more for the\nthief.\"\n\n\"What a leather-headed idea!\" exclaimed the constable. \"The thief das'n't\ngo near them, nor send anybody. Whoever goes is going to get himself\nnabbed, for their ain't any pawnbroker that's going to lose the chance\nto--\"\n\nIf anybody had noticed Tom's face at that time, the gray-green color of\nit might have provoked curiosity; but nobody did. He said to himself:\n\"I'm gone! I never can square up; the rest of the plunder won't pawn or\nsell for half of the bill. Oh, I know it--I'm gone, I'm gone--and this\ntime it's for good. Oh, this is awful--I don't know what to do, nor\nwhich way to turn!\"\n\n\"Softly, softly,\" said Wilson to Blake. \"I planned their scheme for them\nat midnight last night, and it was all finished up shipshape by two this\nmorning. They'll get their dagger back, and then I'll explain to you how\nthe thing was done.\"\n\nThere were strong signs of a general curiosity, and Buckstone said:\n\n\"Well, you have whetted us up pretty sharp, Wilson, and I'm free to say\nthat if you don't mind telling us in confidence--\"\n\n\"Oh, I'd as soon tell as not, Buckstone, but as long as the twins and I\nagreed to say nothing about it, we must let it stand so. But you can take\nmy word for it, you won't be kept waiting three days. Somebody will apply\nfor that reward pretty promptly, and I'll show you the thief and the\ndagger both very soon afterward.\"\n\nThe constable was disappointed, and also perplexed. He said:\n\n\"It may all be--yes, and I hope it will, but I'm blamed if I can see my\nway through it. It's too many for yours truly.\"\n\nThe subject seemed about talked out. Nobody seemed to have anything\nfurther to offer. After a silence the justice of the peace informed\nWilson that he and Buckstone and the constable had come as a committee,\non the part of the Democratic party, to ask him to run for mayor--for the\nlittle town was about to become a city and the first charter election was\napproaching. It was the first attention which Wilson had ever received\nat the hands of any party; it was a sufficiently humble one, but it was a\nrecognition of his debut into the town's life and activities at last; it\nwas a step upward, and he was deeply gratified. He accepted, and the\ncommittee departed, followed by young Tom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14 -- Roxana Insists Upon Reform\n\n     _The true Southern watermelon is a boon apart, and not to be\n     mentioned with commoner things. It is chief of this world's\n     luxuries, king by the grace of God over all the fruits of\n     the earth. When one has tasted it, he knows what the angels\n     eat. It was not a Southern watermelon that Eve took: we know\n     it because she repented._ --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n\nAbout the time that Wilson was bowing the committee out, Pembroke Howard\nwas entering the next house to report. He found the old judge sitting\ngrim and straight in his chair, waiting.\n\n\"Well, Howard--the news?\"\n\n\"The best in the world.\"\n\n\"Accepts, does he?\" and the light of battle gleamed joyously in the\nJudge's eye.\n\n\"Accepts? Why he jumped at it.\"\n\n\"Did, did he? Now that's fine--that's very fine. I like that. When is\nit to be?\"\n\n\"Now! Straight off! Tonight! An admirable fellow--admirable!\"\n\n\"Admirable? He's a darling! Why, it's an honor as well as a pleasure to\nstand up before such a man. Come--off with you! Go and arrange\neverything--and give him my heartiest compliments. A rare fellow, indeed;\nan admirable fellow, as you have said!\"\n\n\"I'll have him in the vacant stretch between Wilson's and the haunted\nhouse within the hour, and I'll bring my own pistols.\"\n\nJudge Driscoll began to walk the floor in a state of pleased excitement;\nbut presently he stopped, and began to think--began to think of Tom.\nTwice he moved toward the secretary, and twice he turned away again; but\nfinally he said:\n\n\"This may be my last night in the world--I must not take the chance. He\nis worthless and unworthy, but it is largely my fault. He was entrusted\nto me by my brother on his dying bed, and I have indulged him to his\nhurt, instead of training him up severely, and making a man of him, I\nhave violated my trust, and I must not add the sin of desertion to that.\nI have forgiven him once already, and would subject him to a long and\nhard trial before forgiving him again, if I could live; but I must not\nrun that risk. No, I must restore the will. But if I survive the duel, I\nwill hide it away, and he will not know, and I will not tell him until he\nreforms, and I see that his reformation is going to be permanent.\"\n\nHe redrew the will, and his ostensible nephew was heir to a fortune\nagain. As he was finishing his task, Tom, wearied with another brooding\ntramp, entered the house and went tiptoeing past the sitting room door.\nHe glanced in, and hurried on, for the sight of his uncle was nothing but\nterrors for him tonight. But his uncle was writing! That was unusual at\nthis late hour. What could he be writing? A chill of anxiety settled\ndown upon Tom's heart. Did that writing concern him? He was afraid so.\nHe reflected that when ill luck begins, it does not come in sprinkles,\nbut in showers. He said he would get a glimpse of that document or know\nthe reason why. He heard someone coming, and stepped out of sight and\nhearing. It was Pembroke Howard. What could be hatching?\n\nHoward said, with great satisfaction:\n\n\"Everything's right and ready. He's gone to the battleground with his\nsecond and the surgeon--also with his brother. I've arranged it all with\nWilson--Wilson's his second. We are to have three shots apiece.\"\n\n\"Good! How is the moon?\"\n\n\"Bright as day, nearly. Perfect, for the distance--fifteen yards. No\nwind--not a breath; hot and still.\"\n\n\"All good; all first-rate. Here, Pembroke, read this, and witness it.\"\n\nPembroke read and witnessed the will, then gave the old man's hand a\nhearty shake and said:\n\n\"Now that's right, York--but I knew you would do it. You couldn't leave\nthat poor chap to fight along without means or profession, with certain\ndefeat before him, and I knew you wouldn't, for his father's sake if not\nfor his own.\"\n\n\"For his dead father's sake, I couldn't, I know; for poor Percy--but you\nknow what Percy was to me. But mind--Tom is not to know of this unless I\nfall tonight.\"\n\n\"I understand. I'll keep the secret.\"\n\nThe judge put the will away, and the two started for the battleground. In\nanother minute the will was in Tom's hands. His misery vanished, his\nfeelings underwent a tremendous revulsion. He put the will carefully back\nin its place, and spread his mouth and swung his hat once, twice, three\ntimes around his head, in imitation of three rousing huzzahs, no sound\nissuing from his lips. He fell to communing with himself excitedly and\njoyously, but every now and then he let off another volley of dumb\nhurrahs.\n\nHe said to himself: \"I've got the fortune again, but I'll not let on\nthat I know about it. And this time I'm going to hang on to it. I take no\nmore risks. I'll gamble no more, I'll drink no more, because--well,\nbecause I'll not go where there is any of that sort of thing going on,\nagain. It's the sure way, and the only sure way; I might have thought of\nthat sooner--well, yes, if I had wanted to. But now--dear me, I've had a\nscare this time, and I'll take no more chances. Not a single chance\nmore. Land! I persuaded myself this evening that I could fetch him\naround without any great amount of effort, but I've been getting more and\nmore heavyhearted and doubtful straight along, ever since. If he tells\nme about this thing, all right; but if he doesn't, I sha'n't let on.\nI--well, I'd like to tell Pudd'nhead Wilson, but--no, I'll think about\nthat; perhaps I won't.\" He whirled off another dead huzzah, and said,\n\"I'm reformed, and this time I'll stay so, sure!\"\n\nHe was about to close with a final grand silent demonstration, when he\nsuddenly recollected that Wilson had put it out of his power to pawn or\nsell the Indian knife, and that he was once more in awful peril of\nexposure by his creditors for that reason. His joy collapsed utterly, and\nhe turned away and moped toward the door moaning and lamenting over the\nbitterness of his luck. He dragged himself upstairs, and brooded in his\nroom a long time, disconsolate and forlorn, with Luigi's Indian knife for\na text. At last he sighed and said:\n\n\"When I supposed these stones were glass and this ivory bone, the thing\nhadn't any interest for me because it hadn't any value, and couldn't help\nme out of my trouble. But now--why, now it is full of interest; yes, and\nof a sort to break a body's heart. It's a bag of gold that has turned to\ndirt and ashes in my hands. It could save me, and save me so easily, and\nyet I've got to go to ruin. It's like drowning with a life preserver in\nmy reach. All the hard luck comes to me, and all the good luck goes to\nother people--Pudd'nhead Wilson, for instance; even his career has got a\nsort of a little start at last, and what has he done to deserve it, I\nshould like to know? Yes, he has opened his own road, but he isn't\ncontent with that, but must block mine. It's a sordid, selfish world, and\nI wish I was out of it.\" He allowed the light of the candle to play upon\nthe jewels of the sheath, but the flashings and sparklings had no charm\nfor his eye; they were only just so many pangs to his heart. \"I must not\nsay anything to Roxy about this thing,\" he said. \"She is too daring. She\nwould be for digging these stones out and selling them, and then--why,\nshe would be arrested and the stones traced, and then--\" The thought made\nhim quake, and he hid the knife away, trembling all over and glancing\nfurtively about, like a criminal who fancies that the accuser is already\nat hand.\n\nShould he try to sleep? Oh, no, sleep was not for him; his trouble was\ntoo haunting, too afflicting for that. He must have somebody to mourn\nwith. He would carry his despair to Roxy.\n\nHe had heard several distant gunshots, but that sort of thing was not\nuncommon, and they had made no impression upon him. He went out at the\nback door, and turned westward. He passed Wilson's house and proceeded\nalong the lane, and presently saw several figures approaching Wilson's\nplace through the vacant lots. These were the duelists returning from the\nfight; he thought he recognized them, but as he had no desire for white\npeople's company, he stooped down behind the fence until they were out of\nhis way.\n\nRoxy was feeling fine. She said:\n\n\"Whah was you, child? Warn't you in it?\"\n\n\"In what?\"\n\n\"In de duel.\"\n\n\"Duel? Has there been a duel?\"\n\n\"Co'se dey has. De ole Jedge has be'n havin' a duel wid one o' dem\ntwins.\"\n\n\"Great Scott!\" Then he added to himself: \"That's what made him remake\nthe will; he thought he might get killed, and it softened him toward me.\nAnd that's what he and Howard were so busy about. . . . Oh dear, if the\ntwin had only killed him, I should be out of my--\"\n\n\"What is you mumblin' 'bout, Chambers? Whah was you? Didn't you know dey\nwas gwine to be a duel?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't. The old man tried to get me to fight one with Count\nLuigi, but he didn't succeed, so I reckon he concluded to patch up the\nfamily honor himself.\"\n\nHe laughed at the idea, and went rambling on with a detailed account of\nhis talk with the judge, and how shocked and ashamed the judge was to\nfind that he had a coward in his family. He glanced up at last, and got\na shock himself. Roxana's bosom was heaving with suppressed passion, and\nshe was glowering down upon him with measureless contempt written in her\nface.\n\n\"En you refuse' to fight a man dat kicked you, 'stid o' jumpin' at de\nchance! En you ain't got no mo' feelin' den to come en tell me, dat\nfetched sich a po' lowdown ornery rabbit into de worl'! Pah! it make me\nsick! It's de nigger in you, dat's what it is. Thirty-one parts o' you\nis white, en on'y one part nigger, en dat po' little one part is yo'\n_soul_. 'Tain't wuth savin'; 'tain't wuth totin' out on a shovel en\nthrowin' en de gutter. You has disgraced yo' birth. What would yo' pa\nthink o' you? It's enough to make him turn in his grave.\"\n\nThe last three sentences stung Tom into a fury, and he said to himself\nthat if his father were only alive and in reach of assassination his\nmother would soon find that he had a very clear notion of the size of his\nindebtedness to that man, and was willing to pay it up in full, and would\ndo it too, even at risk of his life; but he kept this thought to himself;\nthat was safest in his mother's present state.\n\n\"Whatever has come o' yo' Essex blood? Dat's what I can't understan'.\nEn it ain't on'y jist Essex blood dat's in you, not by a long\nsight--'deed it ain't! My great-great-great-gran'father en yo'\ngreat-great-great-great-gran'father was Ole Cap'n John Smith, de highest\nblood dat Ole Virginny ever turned out, en _his_ great-great-gran'mother,\nor somers along back dah, was Pocahontas de Injun queen, en her husbun'\nwas a nigger king outen Africa--en yit here you is, a slinkin' outen a\nduel en disgracin' our whole line like a ornery lowdown hound! Yes, it's\nde nigger in you!\"\n\nShe sat down on her candle box and fell into a reverie. Tom did not\ndisturb her; he sometimes lacked prudence, but it was not in\ncircumstances of this kind, Roxana's storm went gradually down, but it\ndied hard, and even when it seemed to be quite gone, it would now and\nthen break out in a distant rumble, so to speak, in the form of muttered\nejaculations. One of these was, \"Ain't nigger enough in him to show in\nhis fingernails, en dat takes mighty little--yit dey's enough to pain\nhis soul.\"\n\nPresently she muttered. \"Yassir, enough to paint a whole thimbleful of\n'em.\" At last her ramblings ceased altogether, and her countenance began\nto clear--a welcome sight to Tom, who had learned her moods, and knew she\nwas on the threshold of good humor now. He noticed that from time to time\nshe unconsciously carried her finger to the end of her nose. He looked\ncloser and said:\n\n\"Why, Mammy, the end of your nose is skinned. How did that come?\"\n\nShe sent out the sort of wholehearted peal of laughter which God had\nvouchsafed in its perfection to none but the happy angels in heaven and\nthe bruised and broken black slave on the earth, and said:\n\n\"Dad fetch dat duel, I be'n in it myself.\"\n\n\"Gracious! did a bullet do that?\"\n\n\"Yassir, you bet it did!\"\n\n\"Well, I declare! Why, how did that happen?\"\n\n\"Happened dis-away. I 'uz a-sett'n' here kinder dozin' in de dark, en\n_che-bang!_ goes a gun, right out dah. I skips along out towards t'other\nend o' de house to see what's gwine on, en stops by de ole winder on de\nside towards Pudd'nhead Wilson's house dat ain't got no sash in it--but\ndey ain't none of 'em got any sashes, for as dat's concerned--en I stood\ndah in de dark en look out, en dar in the moonlight, right down under me\n'uz one o' de twins a-cussin'--not much, but jist a-cussin' soft--it 'uz\nde brown one dat 'uz cussin,' 'ca'se he 'uz hit in de shoulder. En\nDoctor Claypool he 'uz a-workin' at him, en Pudd'nhead Wilson he 'uz\na-he'pin', en ole Jedge Driscoll en Pem Howard 'uz a-standin' out yonder\na little piece waitin' for 'em to get ready agin. En treckly dey squared\noff en give de word, en _bang-bang_ went de pistols, en de twin he say,\n'Ouch!'--hit him on de han' dis time--en I hear dat same bullet go\n_spat!_ ag'in de logs under de winder; en de nex' time dey shoot, de twin\nsay, 'Ouch!' ag'in, en I done it too, 'ca'se de bullet glance' on his\ncheekbone en skip up here en glance' on de side o' de winder en whiz\nright acrost my face en tuck de hide off'n my nose--why, if I'd 'a'\nbe'n jist a inch or a inch en a half furder 't would 'a' tuck de whole\nnose en disfiggered me. Here's de bullet; I hunted her up.\"\n\n\"Did you stand there all the time?\"\n\n\"Dat's a question to ask, ain't it! What else would I do? Does I git a\nchance to see a duel every day?\"\n\n\"Why, you were right in range! Weren't you afraid?\"\n\nThe woman gave a sniff of scorn.\n\n\"'Fraid! De Smith-Pocahontases ain't 'fraid o' nothin', let alone\nbullets.\"\n\n\"They've got pluck enough, I suppose; what they lack is judgment. _I_\nwouldn't have stood there.\"\n\n\"Nobody's accusin' you!\"\n\n\"Did anybody else get hurt?\"\n\n\"Yes, we all got hit 'cep' de blon' twin en de doctor en de seconds. De\nJedge didn't git hurt, but I hear Pudd'nhead say de bullet snip some o'\nhis ha'r off.\"\n\n\"'George!\" said Tom to himself, \"to come so near being out of my trouble,\nand miss it by an inch. Oh dear, dear, he will live to find me out and\nsell me to some nigger trader yet--yes, and he would do it in a minute.\"\nThen he said aloud, in a grave tone:\n\n\"Mother, we are in an awful fix.\"\n\nRoxana caught her breath with a spasm, and said:\n\n\"Chile! What you hit a body so sudden for, like dat? What's be'n en gone\nen happen'?\"\n\n\"Well, there's one thing I didn't tell you. When I wouldn't fight, he\ntore up the will again, and--\"\n\nRoxana's face turned a dead white, and she said:\n\n\"Now you's _done!_--done forever! Dat's de end. Bofe un us is gwine to\nstarve to--\"\n\n\"Wait and hear me through, can't you! I reckon that when he resolved to\nfight, himself, he thought he might get killed and not have a chance to\nforgive me any more in this life, so he made the will again, and I've\nseen it, and it's all right. But--\"\n\n\"Oh, thank goodness, den we's safe ag'in!--safe! en so what did you want\nto come here en talk sich dreadful--\"\n\n\"Hold ON, I tell you, and let me finish. The swag I gathered won't half\nsquare me up, and the first thing we know, my creditors--well, you know\nwhat'll happen.\"\n\nRoxana dropped her chin, and told her son to leave her alone--she must\nthink this matter out. Presently she said impressively:\n\n\"You got to go mighty keerful now, I tell you! En here's what you got to\ndo. He didn't git killed, en if you gives him de least reason, he'll\nbust de will ag'in, en dat's de _las'_ time, now you hear me! So--you's\ngot to show him what you kin do in de nex' few days. You got to be pison\ngood, en let him see it; you got to do everything dat'll make him b'lieve\nin you, en you got to sweeten aroun' ole Aunt Pratt, too--she's pow'ful\nstrong with de Jedge, en de bes' frien' you got. Nex', you'll go 'long\naway to Sent Louis, en dat'll _keep_ him in yo' favor. Den you go en make\na bargain wid dem people. You tell 'em he ain't gwine to live long--en\ndat's de fac', too--en tell 'em you'll pay 'em intrust, en big intrust,\ntoo--ten per--what you call it?\"\n\n\"Ten percent a month?\"\n\n\"Dat's it. Den you take and sell yo' truck aroun', a little at a time,\nen pay de intrust. How long will it las'?\"\n\n\"I think there's enough to pay the interest five or six months.\" \"Den\nyou's all right. If he don't die in six months, dat don't make no\ndiff'rence--Providence'll provide. You's gwine to be safe--if you\nbehaves.\" She bent an austere eye on him and added, \"En you IS gwine to\nbehave--does you know dat?\"\n\nHe laughed and said he was going to try, anyway. She did not unbend. She\nsaid gravely:\n\n\"Tryin' ain't de thing. You's gwine to _do_ it. You ain't gwine to\nsteal a pin--'ca'se it ain't safe no mo'; en you ain't gwine into no bad\ncomp'ny--not even once, you understand; en you ain't gwine to drink a\ndrop--nary a single drop; en you ain't gwine to gamble one single\ngamble--not one! Dis ain't what you's gwine to try to do, it's what\nyou's gwine to DO. En I'll tell you how I knows it. Dis is how. I's\ngwine to foller along to Sent Louis my own self; en you's gwine to come\nto me every day o' your life, en I'll look you over; en if you fails in\none single one o' dem things--jist _one_--I take my oath I'll come\nstraight down to dis town en tell de Jedge you's a nigger en a slave--en\n_prove_ it!\" She paused to let her words sink home. Then she added,\n\"Chambers, does you b'lieve me when I says dat?\"\n\nTom was sober enough now. There was no levity in his voice when he\nanswered:\n\n\"Yes, Mother, I know, now, that I am reformed--and permanently.\nPermanently--and beyond the reach of any human temptation.\"\n\n\"Den g'long home en begin!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15 -- The Robber Robbed\n\n     _Nothing so needs reforming as other people's habits._\n     --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n     _Behold, the fool saith, \"Put not all thine eggs in the one\n     basket\"--which is but a manner of saying, \"Scatter your\n     money and your attention\"; but the wise man saith, \"Put all\n     your eggs in the one basket and--WATCH THAT BASKET!\"_\n     --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n\nWhat a time of it Dawson's Landing was having! All its life it had been\nasleep, but now it hardly got a chance for a nod, so swiftly did big\nevents and crashing surprises come along in one another's wake: Friday\nmorning, first glimpse of Real Nobility, also grand reception at Aunt\nPatsy Cooper's, also great robber raid; Friday evening, dramatic kicking\nof the heir of the chief citizen in presence of four hundred people;\nSaturday morning, emergence as practicing lawyer of the long-submerged\nPudd'nhead Wilson; Saturday night, duel between chief citizen and titled\nstranger.\n\nThe people took more pride in the duel than in all the other events put\ntogether, perhaps. It was a glory to their town to have such a thing\nhappen there. In their eyes the principals had reached the summit of\nhuman honor. Everybody paid homage to their names; their praises were in\nall mouths. Even the duelists' subordinates came in for a handsome share\nof the public approbation: wherefore Pudd'nhead Wilson was suddenly\nbecome a man of consequence. When asked to run for the mayoralty Saturday\nnight, he was risking defeat, but Sunday morning found him a made man and\nhis success assured.\n\nThe twins were prodigiously great now; the town took them to its bosom\nwith enthusiasm. Day after day, and night after night, they went dining\nand visiting from house to house, making friends, enlarging and\nsolidifying their popularity, and charming and surprising all with their\nmusical prodigies, and now and then heightening the effects with samples\nof what they could do in other directions, out of their stock of rare and\ncurious accomplishments. They were so pleased that they gave the\nregulation thirty days' notice, the required preparation for citizenship,\nand resolved to finish their days in this pleasant place. That was the\nclimax. The delighted community rose as one man and applauded; and when\nthe twins were asked to stand for seats in the forthcoming aldermanic\nboard, and consented, the public contentment was rounded and complete.\n\nTom Driscoll was not happy over these things; they sunk deep, and hurt\nall the way down. He hated the one twin for kicking him, and the other\none for being the kicker's brother.\n\nNow and then the people wondered why nothing was heard of the raider, or\nof the stolen knife or the other plunder, but nobody was able to throw\nany light on that matter. Nearly a week had drifted by, and still the\nthing remained a vexed mystery.\n\nOn Sunday Constable Blake and Pudd'nhead Wilson met on the street, and\nTom Driscoll joined them in time to open their conversation for them. He\nsaid to Blake: \"You are not looking well, Blake; you seem to be annoyed\nabout something. Has anything gone wrong in the detective business? I\nbelieve you fairly and justifiably claim to have a pretty good reputation\nin that line, isn't it so?\"--which made Blake feel good, and look it;\nbut Tom added, \"for a country detective\"--which made Blake feel the other\nway, and not only look it, but betray it in his voice.\n\n\"Yes, sir, I _have_ got a reputation; and it's as good as anybody's in\nthe profession, too, country or no country.\"\n\n\"Oh, I beg pardon; I didn't mean any offense. What I started out to ask\nwas only about the old woman that raided the town--the stoop-shouldered\nold woman, you know, that you said you were going to catch; and I knew\nyou would, too, because you have the reputation of never boasting,\nand--well, you--you've caught the old woman?\"\n\n\"Damn the old woman!\"\n\n\"Why, sho! you don't mean to say you haven't caught her?\"\n\n\"No, I haven't caught her. If anybody could have caught her, I could;\nbut nobody couldn't, I don't care who he is.\"\n\n\"I am sorry, real sorry--for your sake; because, when it gets around that\na detective has expressed himself confidently, and then--\"\n\n\"Don't you worry, that's all--don't you worry; and as for the town, the\ntown needn't worry either. She's my meat--make yourself easy about that.\nI'm on her track; I've got clues that--\"\n\n\"That's good! Now if you could get an old veteran detective down from\nSt. Louis to help you find out what the clues mean, and where they lead\nto, and then--\"\n\n\"I'm plenty veteran enough myself, and I don't need anybody's help. I'll\nhave her inside of a we--inside of a month. That I'll swear to!\"\n\nTom said carelessly:\n\n\"I suppose that will answer--yes, that will answer. But I reckon she is\npretty old, and old people don't often outlive the cautious pace of the\nprofessional detective when he has got his clues together and is out on\nhis still-hunt.\"\n\nBlake's dull face flushed under this gibe, but before he could set his\nretort in order Tom had turned to Wilson, and was saying, with placid\nindifference of manner and voice:\n\n\"Who got the reward, Pudd'nhead?\"\n\nWilson winced slightly, and saw that his own turn was come.\n\n\"What reward?\"\n\n\"Why, the reward for the thief, and the other one for the knife.\"\n\nWilson answered--and rather uncomfortably, to judge by his hesitating\nfashion of delivering himself:\n\n\"Well, the--well, in face, nobody has claimed it yet.\"\n\nTom seemed surprised.\n\n\"Why, is that so?\"\n\nWilson showed a trifle of irritation when he replied:\n\n\"Yes, it's so. And what of it?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing. Only I thought you had struck out a new idea, and invented\na scheme that was going to revolutionize the timeworn and ineffectual\nmethods of the--\" He stopped, and turned to Blake, who was happy now\nthat another had taken his place on the gridiron. \"Blake, didn't you\nunderstand him to intimate that it wouldn't be necessary for you to hunt\nthe old woman down?\"\n\n\"'B'George, he said he'd have thief and swag both inside of three days\n--he did, by hokey! and that's just about a week ago. Why, I said at the\ntime that no thief and no thief's pal was going to try to pawn or sell a\nthing where he knowed the pawnbroker could get both rewards by taking HIM\ninto camp _with_ the swag. It was the blessedest idea that ever I\nstruck!\"\n\n\"You'd change your mind,\" said Wilson, with irritated bluntness, \"if you\nknew the entire scheme instead of only part of it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the constable, pensively, \"I had the idea that it wouldn't\nwork, and up to now I'm right anyway.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, let it stand at that, and give it a further show. It\nhas worked at least as well as your own methods, you perceive.\"\n\nThe constable hadn't anything handy to hit back with, so he discharged a\ndiscontented sniff, and said nothing.\n\nAfter the night that Wilson had partly revealed his scheme at his house,\nTom had tried for several days to guess out the secret of the rest of it,\nbut had failed. Then it occurred to him to give Roxana's smarter head a\nchance at it. He made up a supposititious case, and laid it before\nher. She thought it over, and delivered her verdict upon it. Tom said\nto himself, \"She's hit it, sure!\" He thought he would test that verdict\nnow, and watch Wilson's face; so he said reflectively:\n\n\"Wilson, you're not a fool--a fact of recent discovery. Whatever your\nscheme was, it had sense in it, Blake's opinion to the contrary\nnotwithstanding. I don't ask you to reveal it, but I will suppose a\ncase--a case which you will answer as a starting point for the real thing\nI am going to come at, and that's all I want. You offered five hundred\ndollars for the knife, and five hundred for the thief. We will suppose,\nfor argument's sake, that the first reward is _advertised_ and the second\noffered by _private letter_ to pawnbrokers and--\"\n\nBlake slapped his thigh, and cried out:\n\n\"By Jackson, he's got you, Pudd'nhead! Now why couldn't I or _any_ fool\nhave thought of that?\"\n\nWilson said to himself, \"Anybody with a reasonably good head would have\nthought of it. I am not surprised that Blake didn't detect it; I am only\nsurprised that Tom did. There is more to him than I supposed.\" He said\nnothing aloud, and Tom went on:\n\n\"Very well. The thief would not suspect that there was a trap, and he\nwould bring or send the knife, and say he bought it for a song, or found\nit in the road, or something like that, and try to collect the reward,\nand be arrested--wouldn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Wilson.\n\n\"I think so,\" said Tom. \"There can't be any doubt of it. Have you ever\nseen that knife?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Has any friend of yours?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of.\"\n\n\"Well, I begin to think I understand why your scheme failed.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Tom? What are you driving at?\" asked Wilson, with a\ndawning sense of discomfort.\n\n\"Why, that there _isn't_ any such knife.\"\n\n\"Look here, Wilson,\" said Blake, \"Tom Driscoll's right, for a thousand\ndollars--if I had it.\"\n\nWilson's blood warmed a little, and he wondered if he had been played\nupon by those strangers; it certainly had something of that look. But\nwhat could they gain by it? He threw out that suggestion. Tom replied:\n\n\"Gain? Oh, nothing that you would value, maybe. But they are strangers\nmaking their way in a new community. Is it nothing to them to appear as\npets of an Oriental prince--at no expense? Is it nothing to them to be\nable to dazzle this poor town with thousand-dollar rewards--at no\nexpense? Wilson, there isn't any such knife, or your scheme would have\nfetched it to light. Or if there is any such knife, they've got it yet.\nI believe, myself, that they've seen such a knife, for Angelo pictured it\nout with his pencil too swiftly and handily for him to have been\ninventing it, and of course I can't swear that they've never had it; but\nthis I'll go bail for--if they had it when they came to this town,\nthey've got it yet.\"\n\nBlake said:\n\n\"It looks mighty reasonable, the way Tom puts it; it most certainly\ndoes.\"\n\nTom responded, turning to leave:\n\n\"You find the old woman, Blake, and if she can't furnish the knife, go\nand search the twins!\"\n\nTom sauntered away. Wilson felt a good deal depressed. He hardly knew\nwhat to think. He was loath to withdraw his faith from the twins, and\nwas resolved not to do it on the present indecisive evidence; but--well,\nhe would think, and then decide how to act.\n\n\"Blake, what do you think of this matter?\"\n\n\"Well, Pudd'nhead, I'm bound to say I put it up the way Tom does. They\nhadn't the knife; or if they had it, they've got it yet.\"\n\nThe men parted. Wilson said to himself:\n\n\"I believe they had it; if it had been stolen, the scheme would have\nrestored it, that is certain. And so I believe they've got it.\"\n\nTom had no purpose in his mind when he encountered those two men. When he\nbegan his talk he hoped to be able to gall them a little and get a trifle\nof malicious entertainment out of it. But when he left, he left in great\nspirits, for he perceived that just by pure luck and no troublesome labor\nhe had accomplished several delightful things: he had touched both men\non a raw spot and seen them squirm; he had modified Wilson's sweetness\nfor the twins with one small bitter taste that he wouldn't be able to get\nout of his mouth right away; and, best of all, he had taken the hated\ntwins down a peg with the community; for Blake would gossip around\nfreely, after the manner of detectives, and within a week the town would\nbe laughing at them in its sleeve for offering a gaudy reward for a\nbauble which they either never possessed or hadn't lost. Tom was very\nwell satisfied with himself.\n\nTom's behavior at home had been perfect during the entire week. His uncle\nand aunt had seen nothing like it before. They could find no fault with\nhim anywhere.\n\nSaturday evening he said to the Judge:\n\n\"I've had something preying on my mind, uncle, and as I am going away,\nand might never see you again, I can't bear it any longer. I made you\nbelieve I was afraid to fight that Italian adventurer. I had to get out\nof it on some pretext or other, and maybe I chose badly, being taken\nunawares, but no honorable person could consent to meet him in the field,\nknowing what I knew about him.\"\n\n\"Indeed? What was that?\"\n\n\"Count Luigi is a confessed assassin.\"\n\n\"Incredible.\"\n\n\"It's perfectly true. Wilson detected it in his hand, by palmistry, and\ncharged him with it, and cornered him up so close that he had to confess;\nbut both twins begged us on their knees to keep the secret, and swore\nthey would lead straight lives here; and it was all so pitiful that we\ngave our word of honor never to expose them while they kept the promise.\nYou would have done it yourself, uncle.\"\n\n\"You are right, my boy; I would. A man's secret is still his own\nproperty, and sacred, when it has been surprised out of him like that.\nYou did well, and I am proud of you.\" Then he added mournfully, \"But I\nwish I could have been saved the shame of meeting an assassin on the\nfield of honor.\"\n\n\"It couldn't be helped, uncle. If I had known you were going to\nchallenge him, I should have felt obliged to sacrifice my pledged word in\norder to stop it, but Wilson couldn't be expected to do otherwise than\nkeep silent.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Wilson did right, and is in no way to blame. Tom, Tom, you have\nlifted a heavy load from my heart; I was stung to the very soul when I\nseemed to have discovered that I had a coward in my family.\"\n\n\"You may imagine what it cost ME to assume such a part, uncle.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know it, poor boy, I know it. And I can understand how much it\nhas cost you to remain under that unjust stigma to this time. But it is\nall right now, and no harm is done. You have restored my comfort of\nmind, and with it your own; and both of us had suffered enough.\"\n\nThe old man sat awhile plunged in thought; then he looked up with a\nsatisfied light in his eye, and said: \"That this assassin should have\nput the affront upon me of letting me meet him on the field of honor as\nif he were a gentleman is a matter which I will presently settle--but not\nnow. I will not shoot him until after election. I see a way to ruin them\nboth before; I will attend to that first. Neither of them shall be\nelected, that I promise. You are sure that the fact that he is an\nassassin has not got abroad?\"\n\n\"Perfectly certain of it, sir.\"\n\n\"It will be a good card. I will fling a hint at it from the stump on the\npolling day. It will sweep the ground from under both of them.\"\n\n\"There's not a doubt of it. It will finish them.\"\n\n\"That and outside work among the voters will, to a certainty. I want you\nto come down here by and by and work privately among the rag-tag and\nbobtail. You shall spend money among them; I will furnish it.\"\n\nAnother point scored against the detested twins! Really it was a great\nday for Tom. He was encouraged to chance a parting shot, now, at the\nsame target, and did it.\n\n\"You know that wonderful Indian knife that the twins have been making\nsuch a to-do about? Well, there's no track or trace of it yet; so the\ntown is beginning to sneer and gossip and laugh. Half the people believe\nthey never had any such knife, the other half believe they had it and\nhave got it still. I've heard twenty people talking like that today.\"\n\nYes, Tom's blemishless week had restored him to the favor of his aunt and\nuncle.\n\nHis mother was satisfied with him, too. Privately, she believed she was\ncoming to love him, but she did not say so. She told him to go along to\nSt. Louis now, and she would get ready and follow. Then she smashed her\nwhisky bottle and said:\n\n\"Dah now! I's a-gwine to make you walk as straight as a string,\nChambers, en so I's bown, you ain't gwine to git no bad example out o'\nyo' mammy. I tole you you couldn't go into no bad comp'ny. Well, you's\ngwine into my comp'ny, en I's gwine to fill de bill. Now, den, trot\nalong, trot along!\"\n\nTom went aboard one of the big transient boats that night with his heavy\nsatchel of miscellaneous plunder, and slept the sleep of the unjust,\nwhich is serener and sounder than the other kind, as we know by the\nhanging-eve history of a million rascals. But when he got up in the\nmorning, luck was against him again: a brother thief had robbed him while\nhe slept, and gone ashore at some intermediate landing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16 -- Sold Down the River\n\n     _If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he\n     will not bite you. This is the principal difference between\n     a dog and a man._ --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n     _We all know about the habits of the ant, we know all about\n     the habits of the bee, but we know nothing at all about the\n     habits of the oyster. It seems almost certain that we have\n     been choosing the wrong time for studying the oyster._\n     --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n\nWhen Roxana arrived, she found her son in such despair and misery that\nher heart was touched and her motherhood rose up strong in her. He was\nruined past hope now; his destruction would be immediate and sure, and he\nwould be an outcast and friendless. That was reason enough for a mother\nto love a child; so she loved him, and told him so. It made him wince,\nsecretly--for she was a \"nigger.\" That he was one himself was far from\nreconciling him to that despised race.\n\nRoxana poured out endearments upon him, to which he responded\nuncomfortably, but as well as he could. And she tried to comfort him, but\nthat was not possible. These intimacies quickly became horrible to him,\nand within the hour he began to try to get up courage enough to tell her\nso, and require that they be discontinued or very considerably modified.\nBut he was afraid of her; and besides, there came a lull now, for she had\nbegun to think. She was trying to invent a saving plan. Finally she\nstarted up, and said she had found a way out. Tom was almost suffocated\nby the joy of this sudden good news. Roxana said:\n\n\"Here is de plan, en she'll win, sure. I's a nigger, en nobody ain't\ngwine to doubt it dat hears me talk. I's wuth six hund'd dollahs. Take\nen sell me, en pay off dese gamblers.\"\n\nTom was dazed. He was not sure he had heard aright. He was dumb for a\nmoment; then he said:\n\n\"Do you mean that you would be sold into slavery to save me?\"\n\n\"Ain't you my chile? En does you know anything dat a mother won't do for\nher chile? Day ain't nothin' a white mother won't do for her chile. Who\nmade 'em so? De Lord done it. En who made de niggers? De Lord made 'em.\nIn de inside, mothers is all de same. De good lord he made 'em so. I's\ngwine to be sole into slavery, en in a year you's gwine to buy yo' ole\nmammy free ag'in. I'll show you how. Dat's de plan.\"\n\nTom's hopes began to rise, and his spirits along with them. He said:\n\n\"It's lovely of you, Mammy--it's just--\"\n\n\"Say it ag'in! En keep on sayin' it! It's all de pay a body kin want in\ndis worl', en it's mo' den enough. Laws bless you, honey, when I's slav'\naroun', en dey 'buses me, if I knows you's a-sayin' dat, 'way off yonder\nsomers, it'll heal up all de sore places, en I kin stan' 'em.\"\n\n\"I DO say it again, Mammy, and I'll keep on saying it, too. But how am I\ngoing to sell you? You're free, you know.\"\n\n\"Much diff'rence dat make! White folks ain't partic'lar. De law kin sell\nme now if dey tell me to leave de state in six months en I don't go. You\ndraw up a paper--bill o' sale--en put it 'way off yonder, down in de\nmiddle o' Kaintuck somers, en sign some names to it, en say you'll sell\nme cheap 'ca'se you's hard up; you'll find you ain't gwine to have no\ntrouble. You take me up de country a piece, en sell me on a farm; dem\npeople ain't gwine to ask no questions if I's a bargain.\"\n\nTom forged a bill of sale and sold his mother to an Arkansas cotton\nplanter for a trifle over six hundred dollars. He did not want to commit\nthis treachery, but luck threw the man in his way, and this saved him the\nnecessity of going up-country to hunt up a purchaser, with the added risk\nof having to answer a lot of questions, whereas this planter was so\npleased with Roxy that he asked next to none at all. Besides, the\nplanter insisted that Roxy wouldn't know where she was, at first, and\nthat by the time she found out she would already have been contented.\n\nSo Tom argued with himself that it was an immense advantaged for Roxy to\nhave a master who was pleased with her, as this planter manifestly was.\nIn almost no time his flowing reasonings carried him to the point of even\nhalf believing he was doing Roxy a splendid surreptitious service in\nselling her \"down the river.\" And then he kept diligently saying to\nhimself all the time: \"It's for only a year. In a year I buy her free\nagain; she'll keep that in mind, and it'll reconcile her.\" Yes; the\nlittle deception could do no harm, and everything would come out right\nand pleasant in the end, anyway. By agreement, the conversation in\nRoxy's presence was all about the man's \"up-country\" farm, and how\npleasant a place it was, and how happy the slaves were there; so poor\nRoxy was entirely deceived; and easily, for she was not dreaming that her\nown son could be guilty of treason to a mother who, in voluntarily going\ninto slavery--slavery of any kind, mild or severe, or of any duration,\nbrief or long--was making a sacrifice for him compared with which death\nwould have been a poor and commonplace one. She lavished tears and\nloving caresses upon him privately, and then went away with her owner\n--went away brokenhearted, and yet proud to do it.\n\nTom scored his accounts, and resolved to keep to the very letter of his\nreform, and never to put that will in jeopardy again. He had three\nhundred dollars left. According to his mother's plan, he was to put that\nsafely away, and add her half of his pension to it monthly. In one year\nthis fund would buy her free again.\n\nFor a whole week he was not able to sleep well, so much the villainy\nwhich he had played upon his trusting mother preyed upon his rag of\nconscience; but after that he began to get comfortable again, and was\npresently able to sleep like any other miscreant.\n\nThe boat bore Roxy away from St. Louis at four in the afternoon, and she\nstood on the lower guard abaft the paddle box and watched Tom through a\nblur of tears until he melted into the throng of people and disappeared;\nthen she looked no more, but sat there on a coil of cable crying till far\ninto the night. When she went to her foul steerage bunk at last, between\nthe clashing engines, it was not to sleep, but only to wait for the\nmorning, and, waiting, grieve.\n\nIt had been imagined that she \"would not know,\" and would think she was\ntraveling upstream. She! Why, she had been steamboating for years. At\ndawn she got up and went listlessly and sat down on the cable coil again.\nShe passed many a snag whose \"break\" could have told her a thing to break\nher heart, for it showed a current moving in the same direction that the\nboat was going; but her thoughts were elsewhere, and she did not notice.\nBut at last the roar of a bigger and nearer break than usual brought her\nout of her torpor, and she looked up, and her practiced eye fell upon\nthat telltale rush of water. For one moment her petrified gaze fixed\nitself there. Then her head dropped upon her breast, and she said:\n\n\"Oh, de good Lord God have mercy on po' sinful me--I'S SOLE DOWN DE\nRIVER!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17 -- The Judge Utters Dire Prophesy\n\n     _Even popularity can be overdone.

The\ntwins threw themselves into it with their whole heart, for their\nself-love was engaged. Their popularity, so general at first, had\nsuffered afterward; mainly because they had been TOO popular, and so a\nnatural reaction had followed. Besides, it had been diligently whispered\naround that it was curious--indeed, VERY curious--that that wonderful\nknife of theirs did not turn up--IF it was so valuable, or IF it had ever\nexisted. And with the whisperings went chucklings and nudgings and winks,\nand such things have an effect. The twins considered that success in the\nelection would reinstate them, and that defeat would work them\nirreparable damage. Therefore they worked hard, but not harder than\nJudge Driscoll and Tom worked against them in the closing days of the\ncanvass. Tom's conduct had remained so letter-perfect during two whole\nmonths now, that his uncle not only trusted him with money with which to\npersuade voters, but trusted him to go and get it himself out of the safe\nin the private sitting room.\n\nThe closing speech of the campaign was made by Judge Driscoll, and he\nmade it against both of the foreigners. It was disastrously effective.\nHe poured out rivers of ridicule upon them, and forced the big mass\nmeeting to laugh and applaud. He scoffed at them as adventurers,\nmountebanks, sideshow riffraff, dime museum freaks; he assailed their\nshowy titles with measureless derision; he said they were back-alley\nbarbers disguised as nobilities, peanut peddlers masquerading as\ngentlemen, organ-grinders bereft of their brother monkey. At last he\nstopped and stood still. He waited until the place had become absolutely\nsilent and expectant, then he delivered his deadliest shot; delivered it\nwith ice-cold seriousness and deliberation, with a significant emphasis\nupon the closing words: he said he believed that the reward offered for\nthe lost knife was humbug and bunkum, and that its owner would know where\nto find it whenever he should have occasion TO ASSASSINATE SOMEBODY.\n\nThen he stepped from the stand, leaving a startled and impressive hush\nbehind him instead of the customary explosion of cheers and party cries.\n\nThe strange remark flew far and wide over the town and made an\nextraordinary sensation. Everybody was asking, \"What could he mean by\nthat?\" And everybody went on asking that question, but in vain; for the\njudge only said he knew what he was talking about, and stopped there; Tom\nsaid he hadn't any idea what his uncle meant, and Wilson, whenever he was\nasked what he thought it meant, parried the question by asking the\nquestioner what HE thought it meant.\n\nWilson was elected, the twins were defeated--crushed, in fact, and left\nforlorn and substantially friendless. Tom went back to St. Louis happy.\n\nDawson's Landing had a week of repose now, and it needed it. But it was\nin an expectant state, for the air was full of rumors of a new duel.\nJudge Driscoll's election labors had prostrated him, but it was said that\nas soon as he was well enough to entertain a challenge he would get one\nfrom Count Luigi.\n\nThe brothers withdrew entirely from society, and nursed their humiliation\nin privacy. They avoided the people, and went out for exercise only late\nat night, when the streets were deserted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18 -- Roxana Commands\n\n     _Gratitude and treachery are merely the two extremities of\n     the same procession. You have seen all of it that is worth\n     staying for when the band and the gaudy officials have gone\n     by._ --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n     _THANKSGIVING DAY. Let us all give humble, hearty, and\n     sincere thanks now, but the turkeys. In the island of Fiji\n     they do not use turkeys; they use plumbers. It does not\n     become you and me to sneer at Fiji._ --Pudd'nhead Wilson's\n     Calendar\n\n\nThe Friday after the election was a rainy one in St. Louis. It rained\nall day long, and rained hard, apparently trying its best to wash that\nsoot-blackened town white, but of course not succeeding. Toward midnight\nTom Driscoll arrived at his lodgings from the theater in the heavy\ndownpour, and closed his umbrella and let himself in; but when he would\nhave shut the door, he found that there was another person\nentering--doubtless another lodger; this person closed the door and\ntramped upstairs behind Tom. Tom found his door in the dark, and entered\nit, and turned up the gas. When he faced about, lightly whistling, he\nsaw the back of a man. The man was closing and locking his door from\nhim. His whistle faded out and he felt uneasy. The man turned around, a\nwreck of shabby old clothes, sodden with rain and all a-drip, and showed\na black face under an old slouch hat. Tom was frightened. He tried to\norder the man out, but the words refused to come, and the other man got\nthe start. He said, in a low voice:\n\n\"Keep still--I's yo' mother!\"\n\nTom sunk in a heap on a chair, and gasped out:\n\n\"It was mean of me, and base--I know it; but I meant it for the best, I\ndid indeed--I can swear it.\"\n\nRoxana stood awhile looking mutely down on him while he writhed in shame\nand went on incoherently babbling self-accusations mixed with pitiful\nattempts at explanation and palliation of his crime; then she seated\nherself and took off her hat, and her unkept masses of long brown hair\ntumbled down about her shoulders.\n\n\"It warn't no fault o' yo'n dat dat ain't gray,\" she said sadly, noticing\nthe hair.\n\n\"I know it, I know it! I'm a scoundrel. But I swear I meant it for the\nbest. It was a mistake, of course, but I thought it was for the best, I\ntruly did.\"\n\nRoxana began to cry softly, and presently words began to find their way\nout between her sobs. They were uttered lamentingly, rather than\nangrily.\n\n\"Sell a pusson down de river--DOWN DE RIVER!--for de bes'! I wouldn't\ntreat a dog so! I is all broke down en wore out now, en so I reckon\nit ain't in me to storm aroun' no mo', like I used to when I 'uz trompled\non en 'bused. I don't know--but maybe it's so. Leastways, I's suffered\nso much dat mournin' seem to come mo' handy to me now den stormin'.\"\n\nThese words should have touched Tom Driscoll, but if they did, that\neffect was obliterated by a stronger one--one which removed the heavy\nweight of fear which lay upon him, and gave his crushed spirit a most\ngrateful rebound, and filled all his small soul with a deep sense of\nrelief. But he kept prudently still, and ventured no comment. There was\na voiceless interval of some duration now, in which no sounds were heard\nbut the beating of the rain upon the panes, the sighing and complaining\nof the winds, and now and then a muffled sob from Roxana. The sobs became\nmore and more infrequent, and at last ceased. Then the refugee began to\ntalk again.\n\n\"Shet down dat light a little. More. More yit. A pusson dat is hunted\ndon't like de light. Dah--dat'll do. I kin see whah you is, en dat's\nenough. I's gwine to tell you de tale, en cut it jes as short as I kin,\nen den I'll tell you what you's got to do. Dat man dat bought me ain't a\nbad man; he's good enough, as planters goes; en if he could 'a' had his\nway I'd 'a' be'n a house servant in his fambly en be'n comfortable: but\nhis wife she was a Yank, en not right down good lookin', en she riz up\nagin me straight off; so den dey sent me out to de quarter 'mongst de\ncommon fiel' han's. Dat woman warn't satisfied even wid dat, but she\nworked up de overseer ag'in' me, she 'uz dat jealous en hateful; so de\noverseer he had me out befo' day in de mawnin's en worked me de whole\nlong day as long as dey'uz any light to see by; en many's de lashin's I\ngot 'ca'se I couldn't come up to de work o' de stronges'. Dat overseer\nwuz a Yank too, outen New Englan', en anybody down South kin tell you\nwhat dat mean. DEY knows how to work a nigger to death, en dey knows how\nto whale 'em too--whale 'em till dey backs is welted like a washboard.\n'Long at fust my marster say de good word for me to de overseer, but dat\n'uz bad for me; for de mistis she fine it out, en arter dat I jist\nketched it at every turn--dey warn't no mercy for me no mo'.\"\n\nTom's heart was fired--with fury against the planter's wife; and he said\nto himself, \"But for that meddlesome fool, everything would have gone all\nright.\" He added a deep and bitter curse against her.\n\nThe expression of this sentiment was fiercely written in his face, and\nstood thus revealed to Roxana by a white glare of lightning which turned\nthe somber dusk of the room into dazzling day at that moment. She was\npleased--pleased and grateful; for did not that expression show that her\nchild was capable of grieving for his mother's wrongs and of feeling\nresentment toward her persecutors?--a thing which she had been doubting.\nBut her flash of happiness was only a flash, and went out again and left\nher spirit dark; for she said to herself, \"He sole me down de river--he\ncan't feel for a body long; dis'll pass en go.\" Then she took up her tale\nagain.\n\n\"'Bout ten days ago I 'uz sayin' to myself dat I couldn't las' many mo'\nweeks I 'uz so wore out wid de awful work en de lashin's, en so\ndownhearted en misable. En I didn't care no mo', nuther--life warn't\nwuth noth'n' to me, if I got to go on like dat. Well, when a body is in\na frame o' mine like dat, what do a body care what a body do? Dey was a\nlittle sickly nigger wench 'bout ten year ole dat 'uz good to me, en\nhadn't no mammy, po' thing, en I loved her en she loved me; en she come\nout whah I 'uz workin' en she had a roasted tater, en tried to slip it to\nme--robbin' herself, you see, 'ca'se she knowed de overseer didn't give\nme enough to eat--en he ketched her at it, en giver her a lick acrost de\nback wid his stick, which 'uz as thick as a broom handle, en she drop'\nscreamin' on de groun', en squirmin' en wallerin' aroun' in de dust like\na spider dat's got crippled. I couldn't stan' it. All de hellfire dat\n'uz ever in my heart flame' up, en I snatch de stick outen his han' en\nlaid him flat. He laid dah moanin' en cussin', en all out of his head,\nyou know, en de niggers 'uz plumb sk'yred to death. Dey gathered roun'\nhim to he'p him, en I jumped on his hoss en took out for de river as\ntight as I could go. I knowed what dey would do wid me. Soon as he got\nwell he would start in en work me to death if marster let him; en if dey\ndidn't do dat, they'd sell me furder down de river, en dat's de same\nthing, so I 'lowed to drown myself en git out o' my troubles. It 'uz\ngitt'n' towards dark. I 'uz at de river in two minutes. Den I see a\ncanoe, en I says dey ain't no use to drown myself tell I got to; so I\nties de hoss in de edge o' de timber en shove out down de river, keepin'\nin under de shelter o' de bluff bank en prayin' for de dark to shet down\nquick. I had a pow'ful good start, 'ca'se de big house 'uz three mile\nback f'om de river en on'y de work mules to ride dah on, en on'y niggers\nride 'em, en DEY warn't gwine to hurry--dey'd gimme all de chance dey\ncould. Befo' a body could go to de house en back it would be long pas'\ndark, en dey couldn't track de hoss en fine out which way I went tell\nmawnin', en de niggers would tell 'em all de lies dey could 'bout it.\n\n\"Well, de dark come, en I went on a-spinnin' down de river. I paddled\nmo'n two hours, den I warn't worried no mo', so I quit paddlin' en\nfloated down de current, considerin' what I 'uz gwine to do if I didn't\nhave to drown myself. I made up some plans, en floated along, turnin'\n'em over in my mine. Well, when it 'uz a little pas' midnight, as I\nreckoned, en I had come fifteen or twenty mile, I see de lights o' a\nsteamboat layin' at de bank, whah dey warn't no town en no woodyard, en\nputty soon I ketched de shape o' de chimbly tops ag'in' de stars, en den\ngood gracious me, I 'most jumped out o' my skin for joy! It 'uz de GRAN'\nMOGUL--I 'uz chambermaid on her for eight seasons in de Cincinnati en\nOrleans trade. I slid 'long pas'--don't see nobody stirrin' nowhah--hear\n'em a-hammerin' away in de engine room, den I knowed what de matter\nwas--some o' de machinery's broke. I got asho' below de boat and turn'\nde canoe loose, den I goes 'long up, en dey 'uz jes one plank out, en I\nstep' 'board de boat. It 'uz pow'ful hot, deckhan's en roustabouts 'uz\nsprawled aroun' asleep on de fo'cas'l', de second mate, Jim Bangs, he sot\ndah on de bitts wid his head down, asleep--'ca'se dat's de way de second\nmate stan' de cap'n's watch!--en de ole watchman, Billy Hatch, he 'uz\na-noddin' on de companionway;--en I knowed 'em all; en, lan', but dey did\nlook good! I says to myself, I wished old marster'd come along NOW en\ntry to take me--bless yo' heart, I's 'mong frien's, I is. So I tromped\nright along 'mongst 'em, en went up on de b'iler deck en 'way back aft to\nde ladies' cabin guard, en sot down dah in de same cheer dat I'd sot in\n'mos' a hund'd million times, I reckon; en it 'uz jist home ag'in, I tell\nyou!\n\n\"In 'bout an hour I heard de ready bell jingle, en den de racket begin.\nPutty soon I hear de gong strike. 'Set her back on de outside,' I says\nto myself. 'I reckon I knows dat music!' I hear de gong ag'in. 'Come\nahead on de inside,' I says. Gong ag'in. 'Stop de outside.' gong ag'in.\n'Come ahead on de outside--now we's pinted for Sent Louis, en I's outer\nde woods en ain't got to drown myself at all.' I knowed de MOGUL 'uz in\nde Sent Louis trade now, you see. It 'uz jes fair daylight when we\npassed our plantation, en I seed a gang o' niggers en white folks huntin'\nup en down de sho', en troublin' deyselves a good deal 'bout me; but I\nwarn't troublin' myself none 'bout dem.\n\n\"'Bout dat time Sally Jackson, dat used to be my second chambermaid en\n'uz head chambermaid now, she come out on de guard, en 'uz pow'ful glad\nto see me, en so 'uz all de officers; en I tole 'em I'd got kidnapped en\nsole down de river, en dey made me up twenty dollahs en give it to me, en\nSally she rigged me out wid good clo'es, en when I got here I went\nstraight to whah you used to wuz, en den I come to dis house, en dey say\nyou's away but 'spected back every day; so I didn't dast to go down de\nriver to Dawson's, 'ca'se I might miss you.\n\n\"Well, las' Monday I 'uz pass'n by one o' dem places in fourth street\nwhah deh sticks up runaway nigger bills, en he'ps to ketch 'em, en I seed\nmy marster! I 'mos' flopped down on de groun', I felt so gone. He had\nhis back to me, en 'uz talkin' to de man en givin' him some bills--nigger\nbills, I reckon, en I's de nigger. He's offerin' a reward--dat's it.\nAin't I right, don't you reckon?\"\n\nTom had been gradually sinking into a state of ghastly terror, and he\nsaid to himself, now: \"I'm lost, no matter what turn things take! This\nman has said to me that he thinks there was something suspicious about\nthat sale; he said he had a letter from a passenger on the GRAND MOGUL\nsaying that Roxy came here on that boat and that everybody on board knew\nall about the case; so he says that her coming here instead of flying to\na free state looks bad for me, and that if I don't find her for him, and\nthat pretty soon, he will make trouble for me. I never believed that\nstory; I couldn't believe she would be so dead to all motherly instincts\nas to come here, knowing the risk she would run of getting me into\nirremediable trouble. And after all, here she is! And I stupidly swore\nI would help find her, thinking it was a perfectly safe thing to promise.\nIf I venture to deliver her up, she--she--but how can I help myself?\nI've got to do that or pay the money, and where's the money to come from?\nI--I--well, I should think that if he would swear to treat her kindly\nhereafter--and she says, herself, that he is a good man--and if he would\nswear to never allow her to be overworked, or ill fed, or--\"\n\nA flash of lightning exposed Tom's pallid face, drawn and rigid with\nthese worrying thoughts. Roxana spoke up sharply now, and there was\napprehension in her voice.\n\n\"Turn up dat light! I want to see yo' face better. Dah now--lemme look\nat you. Chambers, you's as white as yo' shirt! Has you see dat man? Has\nhe be'n to see you?\"\n\n\"Ye-s.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"Monday noon.\"\n\n\"Monday noon! Was he on my track?\"\n\n\"He--well, he thought he was. That is, he hoped he was. This is the bill\nyou saw.\" He took it out of his pocket.\n\n\"Read it to me!\"\n\nShe was panting with excitement, and there was a dusky glow in her eyes\nthat Tom could not translate with certainty, but there seemed to be\nsomething threatening about it. The handbill had the usual rude woodcut\nof a turbaned Negro woman running, with the customary bundle on a stick\nover her shoulder, and the heading in bold type, \"$100 REWARD.\" Tom read\nthe bill aloud--at least the part that described Roxana and named the\nmaster and his St. Louis address and the address of the Fourth street\nagency; but he left out the item that applicants for the reward might\nalso apply to Mr. Thomas Driscoll.\n\n\"Gimme de bill!\"\n\nTom had folded it and was putting it in his pocket. He felt a chilly\nstreak creeping down his back, but said as carelessly as he could:\n\n\"The bill? Why, it isn't any use to you, you can't read it. What do you\nwant with it?\"\n\n\"Gimme de bill!\" Tom gave it to her, but with a reluctance which he\ncould not entirely disguise. \"Did you read it ALL to me?\"\n\n\"Certainly I did.\"\n\n\"Hole up yo' han' en swah to it.\"\n\nTom did it. Roxana put the bill carefully away in her pocket, with her\neyes fixed upon Tom's face all the while; then she said:\n\n\"Yo's lyin'!\"\n\n\"What would I want to lie about it for?\"\n\n\"I don't know--but you is. Dat's my opinion, anyways. But nemmine 'bout\ndat. When I seed dat man I 'uz dat sk'yerd dat I could sca'cely wobble\nhome. Den I give a nigger man a dollar for dese clo'es, en I ain't be'in\nin a house sence, night ner day, till now. I blacked my face en laid hid\nin de cellar of a ole house dat's burnt down, daytimes, en robbed de\nsugar hogsheads en grain sacks on de wharf, nights, to git somethin' to\neat, en never dast to try to buy noth'n', en I's 'mos' starved. En I\nnever dast to come near dis place till dis rainy night, when dey ain't no\npeople roun' sca'cely. But tonight I be'n a-stanin' in de dark alley\never sence night come, waitin' for you to go by. En here I is.\"\n\nShe fell to thinking. Presently she said:\n\n\"You seed dat man at noon, las' Monday?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I seed him de middle o' dat arternoon. He hunted you up, didn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Did he give you de bill dat time?\"\n\n\"No, he hadn't got it printed yet.\"\n\nRoxana darted a suspicious glance at him.\n\n\"Did you he'p him fix up de bill?\"\n\nTom cursed himself for making that stupid blunder, and tried to rectify\nit by saying he remembered now that it WAS at noon Monday that the man\ngave him the bill. Roxana said:\n\n\"You's lyin' ag'in, sho.\" Then she straightened up and raised her\nfinger:\n\n\"Now den! I's gwine to ask you a question, en I wants to know how you's\ngwine to git aroun' it. You knowed he 'uz arter me; en if you run off,\n'stid o' stayin' here to he'p him, he'd know dey 'uz somethin' wrong\n'bout dis business, en den he would inquire 'bout you, en dat would take\nhim to yo' uncle, en yo' uncle would read de bill en see dat you be'n\nsellin' a free nigger down de river, en you know HIM, I reckon! He'd\nt'ar up de will en kick you outen de house. Now, den, you answer me dis\nquestion: hain't you tole dat man dat I would be sho' to come here, en\nden you would fix it so he could set a trap en ketch me?\"\n\nTom recognized that neither lies nor arguments could help him any\nlonger--he was in a vise, with the screw turned on, and out of it there\nwas no budging. His face began to take on an ugly look, and presently he\nsaid, with a snarl:\n\n\"Well, what could I do? You see, yourself, that I was in his grip and\ncouldn't get out.\"\n\nRoxy scorched him with a scornful gaze awhile, then she said:\n\n\"What could you do? You could be Judas to yo' own mother to save yo'\nwuthless hide! Would anybody b'lieve it? No--a dog couldn't! You is de\nlowdownest orneriest hound dat was ever pup'd into dis worl'--en I's\n'sponsible for it!\"--and she spat on him.\n\nHe made no effort to resent this. Roxy reflected a moment, then she\nsaid:\n\n\"Now I'll tell you what you's gwine to do. You's gwine to give dat man\nde money dat you's got laid up, en make him wait till you kin go to de\njudge en git de res' en buy me free agin.\"\n\n\"Thunder! What are you thinking of? Go and ask him for three hundred\ndollars and odd? What would I tell him I want it for, pray?\"\n\nRoxy's answer was delivered in a serene and level voice.\n\n\"You'll tell him you's sole me to pay yo' gamblin' debts en dat you lied\nto me en was a villain, en dat I 'quires you to git dat money en buy me\nback ag'in.\"\n\n\"Why, you've gone stark mad! He would tear the will to shreds in a\nminute--don't you know that?\"\n\n\"Yes, I does.\"\n\n\"Then you don't believe I'm idiot enough to go to him, do you?\"\n\n\"I don't b'lieve nothin' 'bout it--I KNOWS you's a-goin'. I knows it\n'ca'se you knows dat if you don't raise dat money I'll go to him myself,\nen den he'll sell YOU down de river, en you kin see how you like it!\"\n\nTom rose, trembling and excited, and there was an evil light in his eye.\nHe strode to the door and said he must get out of this suffocating place\nfor a moment and clear his brain in the fresh air so that he could\ndetermine what to do. The door wouldn't open. Roxy smiled grimly, and\nsaid:\n\n\"I's got the key, honey--set down. You needn't cle'r up yo' brain none\nto fine out what you gwine to do--_I_ knows what you's gwine to do.\" Tom\nsat down and began to pass his hands through his hair with a helpless and\ndesperate air. Roxy said, \"Is dat man in dis house?\"\n\nTom glanced up with a surprised expression, and asked:\n\n\"What gave you such an idea?\"\n\n\"You done it. Gwine out to cle'r yo' brain! In de fust place you ain't\ngot none to cle'r, en in de second place yo' ornery eye tole on you.\nYou's de lowdownest hound dat ever--but I done told you dat befo'. Now\nden, dis is Friday. You kin fix it up wid dat man, en tell him you's\ngwine away to git de res' o' de money, en dat you'll be back wid it nex'\nTuesday, or maybe Wednesday. You understan'?\"\n\nTom answered sullenly: \"Yes.\"\n\n\"En when you gits de new bill o' sale dat sells me to my own self, take\nen send it in de mail to Mr. Pudd'nhead Wilson, en write on de back dat\nhe's to keep it tell I come. You understan'?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Dat's all den. Take yo' umbreller, en put on yo' hat.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Beca'se you's gwine to see me home to de wharf. You see dis knife? I's\ntoted it aroun' sence de day I seed dat man en bought dese clo'es en it.\nIf he ketch me, I's gwine to kill myself wid it. Now start along, en go\nsof', en lead de way; en if you gives a sign in dis house, or if anybody\ncomes up to you in de street, I's gwine to jam it right into you.\nChambers, does you b'lieve me when I says dat?\"\n\n\"It's no use to bother me with that question. I know your word's good.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's diff'rent from yo'n! Shet de light out en move along--here's\nde key.\"\n\nThey were not followed. Tom trembled every time a late straggler brushed\nby them on the street, and half expected to feel the cold steel in his\nback. Roxy was right at his heels and always in reach. After tramping a\nmile they reached a wide vacancy on the deserted wharves, and in this\ndark and rainy desert they parted.\n\nAs Tom trudged home his mind was full of dreary thoughts and wild plans;\nbut at last he said to himself, wearily:\n\n\"There is but the one way out. I must follow her plan. But with a\nvariation--I will not ask for the money and ruin myself; I will ROB the\nold skinflint.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19 -- The Prophesy Realized\n\n     _Few things are harder to put up with than the annoyance of\n     a good example._ --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n     _It were not best that we should all think alike; it is\n     difference of opinion that makes horse races._ --Pudd'nhead\n     Wilson's Calendar\n\n\nDawson's Landing was comfortably finishing its season of dull repose and\nwaiting patiently for the duel. Count Luigi was waiting, too; but not\npatiently, rumor said. Sunday came, and Luigi insisted on having his\nchallenge conveyed. Wilson carried it. Judge Driscoll declined to fight\nwith an assassin--\"that is,\" he added significantly, \"in the field of\nhonor.\"\n\nElsewhere, of course, he would be ready. Wilson tried to convince him\nthat if he had been present himself when Angelo told him about the\nhomicide committed by Luigi, he would not have considered the act\ndiscreditable to Luigi; but the obstinate old man was not to be moved.\n\nWilson went back to his principal and reported the failure of his\nmission. Luigi was incensed, and asked how it could be that the old\ngentleman, who was by no means dull-witted, held his trifling nephew's\nevidence in inferences to be of more value than Wilson's. But Wilson\nlaughed, and said:\n\n\"That is quite simple; that is easily explicable. I am not his doll--his\nbaby--his infatuation: his nature is. The judge and his late wife never\nhad any children. The judge and his wife were past middle age when this\ntreasure fell into their lap. One must make allowances for a parental\ninstinct that has been starving for twenty-five or thirty years. It is\nfamished, it is crazed with hunger by that time, and will be entirely\nsatisfied with anything that comes handy; its taste is atrophied, it\ncan't tell mud cat from shad. A devil born to a young couple is\nmeasurably recognizable by them as a devil before long, but a devil\nadopted by an old couple is an angel to them, and remains so, through\nthick and thin. Tom is this old man's angel; he is infatuated with him.\nTom can persuade him into things which other people can't--not all\nthings; I don't mean that, but a good many--particularly one class of\nthings: the things that create or abolish personal partialities or\nprejudices in the old man's mind. The old man liked both of you. Tom\nconceived a hatred for you. That was enough; it turned the old man\naround at once. The oldest and strongest friendship must go to the ground\nwhen one of these late-adopted darlings throws a brick at it.\"\n\n\"It's a curious philosophy,\" said Luigi.\n\n\"It ain't philosophy at all--it's a fact. And there is something\npathetic and beautiful about it, too. I think there is nothing more\npathetic than to see one of these poor old childless couples taking a\nmenagerie of yelping little worthless dogs to their hearts; and then\nadding some cursing and squawking parrots and a jackass-voiced macaw; and\nnext a couple of hundred screeching songbirds, and presently some fetid\nguinea pigs and rabbits, and a howling colony of cats. It is all a\ngroping and ignorant effort to construct out of base metal and brass\nfilings, so to speak, something to take the place of that golden treasure\ndenied them by Nature, a child. But this is a digression. The unwritten\nlaw of this region requires you to kill Judge Driscoll on sight, and he\nand the community will expect that attention at your hands--though of\ncourse your own death by his bullet will answer every purpose. Look out\nfor him! Are you healed--that is, fixed?\"\n\n\"Yes, he shall have his opportunity. If he attacks me, I will respond.\"\n\nAs Wilson was leaving, he said:\n\n\"The judge is still a little used up by his campaign work, and will not\nget out for a day or so; but when he does get out, you want to be on the\nalert.\"\n\nAbout eleven at night the twins went out for exercise, and started on a\nlong stroll in the veiled moonlight.\n\nTom Driscoll had landed at Hackett's Store, two miles below Dawson's,\njust about half an hour earlier, the only passenger for that lonely spot,\nand had walked up the shore road and entered Judge Driscoll's house\nwithout having encountered anyone either on the road or under the roof.\n\nHe pulled down his window blinds and lighted his candle. He laid off his\ncoat and hat and began his preparations. He unlocked his trunk and got\nhis suit of girl's clothes out from under the male attire in it, and laid\nit by. Then he blacked his face with burnt cork and put the cork in his\npocket. His plan was to slip down to his uncle's private sitting room\nbelow, pass into the bedroom, steal the safe key from the old gentleman's\nclothes, and then go back and rob the safe. He took up his candle to\nstart. His courage and confidence were high, up to this point, but both\nbegan to waver a little now. Suppose he should make a noise, by some\naccident, and get caught--say, in the act of opening the safe? Perhaps\nit would be well to go armed. He took the Indian knife from its hiding\nplace, and felt a pleasant return of his wandering courage. He slipped\nstealthily down the narrow stair, his hair rising and his pulses halting\nat the slightest creak. When he was halfway down, he was disturbed to\nperceive that the landing below was touched by a faint glow of light.\nWhat could that mean? Was his uncle still up? No, that was not likely;\nhe must have left his night taper there when he went to bed. Tom crept\non down, pausing at every step to listen. He found the door standing\nopen, and glanced in. What he saw pleased him beyond measure. His uncle\nwas asleep on the sofa; on a small table at the head of the sofa a lamp\nwas burning low, and by it stood the old man's small cashbox, closed.\nNear the box was a pile of bank notes and a piece of paper covered with\nfigures in pencil. The safe door was not open. Evidently the sleeper had\nwearied himself with work upon his finances, and was taking a rest.\n\nTom set his candle on the stairs, and began to make his way toward the\npile of notes, stooping low as he went. When he was passing his uncle,\nthe old man stirred in his sleep, and Tom stopped instantly--stopped, and\nsoftly drew the knife from its sheath, with his heart thumping, and his\neyes fastened upon his benefactor's face. After a moment or two he\nventured forward again--one step--reached for his prize and seized it,\ndropping the knife sheath. Then he felt the old man's strong grip upon\nhim, and a wild cry of \"Help! help!\" rang in his ear. Without hesitation\nhe drove the knife home--and was free. Some of the notes escaped from his\nleft hand and fell in the blood on the floor. He dropped the knife and\nsnatched them up and started to fly; transferred them to his left hand,\nand seized the knife again, in his fright and confusion, but remembered\nhimself and flung it from him, as being a dangerous witness to carry away\nwith him.\n\nHe jumped for the stair-foot, and closed the door behind him; and as he\nsnatched his candle and fled upward, the stillness of the night was\nbroken by the sound of urgent footsteps approaching the house. In another\nmoment he was in his room, and the twins were standing aghast over the\nbody of the murdered man!\n\nTom put on his coat, buttoned his hat under it, threw on his suit of\ngirl's clothes, dropped the veil, blew out his light, locked the room\ndoor by which he had just entered, taking the key, passed through his\nother door into the black hall, locked that door and kept the key, then\nworked his way along in the dark and descended the black stairs. He was\nnot expecting to meet anybody, for all interest was centered in the other\npart of the house now; his calculation proved correct. By the time he\nwas passing through the backyard, Mrs. Pratt, her servants, and a dozen\nhalf-dressed neighbors had joined the twins and the dead, and accessions\nwere still arriving at the front door.\n\nAs Tom, quaking as with a palsy, passed out at the gate, three women came\nflying from the house on the opposite side of the lane. They rushed by\nhim and in at the gate, asking him what the trouble was there, but not\nwaiting for an answer. Tom said to himself, \"Those old maids waited to\ndress--they did the same thing the night Stevens's house burned down next\ndoor.\" In a few minutes he was in the haunted house. He lighted a candle\nand took off his girl-clothes. There was blood on him all down his left\nside, and his right hand was red with the stains of the blood-soaked\nnotes which he has crushed in it; but otherwise he was free from this\nsort of evidence. He cleansed his hand on the straw, and cleaned most of\nthe smut from his face. Then he burned the male and female attire to\nashes, scattered the ashes, and put on a disguise proper for a tramp. He\nblew out his light, went below, and was soon loafing down the river road\nwith the intent to borrow and use one of Roxy's devices. He found a\ncanoe and paddled down downstream, setting the canoe adrift as dawn\napproached, and making his way by land to the next village, where he kept\nout of sight till a transient steamer came along, and then took deck\npassage for St. Louis. He was ill at ease until Dawson's Landing was behind\nhim; then he said to himself, \"All the detectives on earth couldn't trace\nme now; there's not a vestige of a clue left in the world; that homicide\nwill take its place with the permanent mysteries, and people won't get\ndone trying to guess out the secret of it for fifty years.\"\n\nIn St. Louis, next morning, he read this brief telegram in the\npapers--dated at Dawson's Landing:\n\n      Judge Driscoll, an old and respected citizen, was assassinated\n      here about midnight by a profligate Italian nobleman or a\n      barber on account of a quarrel growing out of the recent\n      election. The assassin will probably be lynched.\n\n\"One of the twins!\" soliloquized Tom. \"How lucky! It is the knife that\nhas done him this grace. We never know when fortune is trying to favor\nus. I actually cursed Pudd'nhead Wilson in my heart for putting it out\nof my power to sell that knife. I take it back now.\"\n\nTom was now rich and independent. He arranged with the planter, and\nmailed to Wilson the new bill of sale which sold Roxana to herself; then\nhe telegraphed his Aunt Pratt:\n\n      Have seen the awful news in the papers and am almost\n      prostrated with grief. Shall start by packet today. Try to\n      bear up till I come.\n\nWhen Wilson reached the house of mourning and had gathered such details\nas Mrs. Pratt and the rest of the crowd could tell him, he took command\nas mayor, and gave orders that nothing should be touched, but everything\nleft as it was until Justice Robinson should arrive and take the proper\nmeasures as coroner. He cleared everybody out of the room but the twins\nand himself. The sheriff soon arrived and took the twins away to jail.\nWilson told them to keep heart, and promised to do his best in their\ndefense when the case should come to trial. Justice Robinson came\npresently, and with him Constable Blake. They examined the room\nthoroughly. They found the knife and the sheath. Wilson noticed that\nthere were fingerprints on the knife's handle. That pleased him, for the\ntwins had required the earliest comers to make a scrutiny of their hands\nand clothes, and neither these people nor Wilson himself had found any\nbloodstains upon them. Could there be a possibility that the twins had\nspoken the truth when they had said they found the man dead when they ran\ninto the house in answer to the cry for help? He thought of that\nmysterious girl at once. But this was not the sort of work for a girl to\nbe engaged in. No matter; Tom Driscoll's room must be examined.\n\nAfter the coroner's jury had viewed the body and its surroundings, Wilson\nsuggested a search upstairs, and he went along. The jury forced an\nentrance to Tom's room, but found nothing, of course.\n\nThe coroner's jury found that the homicide was committed by Luigi, and\nthat Angelo was accessory to it.\n\nThe town was bitter against the misfortunates, and for the first few days\nafter the murder they were in constant danger of being lynched. The\ngrand jury presently indicted Luigi for murder in the first degree, and\nAngelo as accessory before the fact. The twins were transferred from the\ncity jail to the county prison to await trial.\n\nWilson examined the finger marks on the knife handle and said to himself,\n\"Neither of the twins made those marks. Then manifestly there was\nanother person concerned, either in his own interest or as hired\nassassin.\"\n\nBut who could it be? That, he must try to find out. The safe was not\nopened, the cashbox was closed, and had three thousand dollars in it.\nThen robbery was not the motive, and revenge was. Where had the murdered\nman an enemy except Luigi? There was but that one person in the world\nwith a deep grudge against him.\n\nThe mysterious girl! The girl was a great trial to Wilson. If the motive\nhad been robbery, the girl might answer; but there wasn't any girl that\nwould want to take this old man's life for revenge. He had no quarrels\nwith girls; he was a gentleman.\n\nWilson had perfect tracings of the finger marks of the knife handle; and\namong his glass records he had a great array of fingerprints of women and\ngirls, collected during the last fifteen or eighteen years, but he\nscanned them in vain, they successfully withstood every test; among them\nwere no duplicates of the prints on the knife.\n\nThe presence of the knife on the stage of the murder was a worrying\ncircumstance for Wilson. A week previously he had as good as admitted to\nhimself that he believed Luigi had possessed such a knife, and that he\nstill possessed it notwithstanding his pretense that it had been stolen.\nAnd now here was the knife, and with it the twins. Half the town had\nsaid the twins were humbugging when they claimed they had lost their\nknife, and now these people were joyful, and said, \"I told you so!\"\n\nIf their fingerprints had been on the handle--but useless to bother any\nfurther about that; the fingerprints on the handle were NOT theirs--that\nhe knew perfectly.\n\nWilson refused to suspect Tom; for first, Tom couldn't murder anybody--he\nhadn't character enough; secondly, if he could murder a person he\nwouldn't select his doting benefactor and nearest relative; thirdly,\nself-interest was in the way; for while the uncle lived, Tom was sure of\na free support and a chance to get the destroyed will revived again, but\nwith the uncle gone, that chance was gone too. It was true the will had\nreally been revived, as was now discovered, but Tom could not have been\naware of it, or he would have spoken of it, in his native talky,\nunsecretive way. Finally, Tom was in St. Louis when the murder was done,\nand got the news out of the morning journals, as was shown by his\ntelegram to his aunt. These speculations were unemphasized sensations\nrather than articulated thoughts, for Wilson would have laughed at the\nidea of seriously connecting Tom with the murder.\n\nWilson regarded the case of the twins as desperate--in fact, about\nhopeless. For he argued that if a confederate was not found, an\nenlightened Missouri jury would hang them; sure; if a confederate was\nfound, that would not improve the matter, but simply furnish one more\nperson for the sheriff to hang. Nothing could save the twins but the\ndiscovery of a person who did the murder on his sole personal account--an\nundertaking which had all the aspect of the impossible. Still, the\nperson who made the fingerprints must be sought. The twins might have no\ncase WITH them, but they certainly would have none without him.\n\nSo Wilson mooned around, thinking, thinking, guessing, guessing, day and\nnight, and arriving nowhere. Whenever he ran across a girl or a woman he\nwas not acquainted with, he got her fingerprints, on one pretext or\nanother; and they always cost him a sigh when he got home, for they never\ntallied with the finger marks on the knife handle.\n\nAs to the mysterious girl, Tom swore he knew no such girl, and did not\nremember ever seeing a girl wearing a dress like the one described by\nWilson. He admitted that he did not always lock his room, and that\nsometimes the servants forgot to lock the house doors; still, in his\nopinion the girl must have made but few visits or she would have been\ndiscovered. When Wilson tried to connect her with the stealing raid, and\nthought she might have been the old woman's confederate, if not the very\nthief disguised as an old woman, Tom seemed stuck, and also much\ninterested, and said he would keep a sharp eye out for this person or\npersons, although he was afraid that she or they would be too smart to\nventure again into a town where everybody would now be on the watch for a\ngood while to come.\n\nEverybody was pitying Tom, he looked so quiet and sorrowful, and seemed\nto feel his great loss so deeply. He was playing a part, but it was not\nall a part. The picture of his alleged uncle, as he had last seen him,\nwas before him in the dark pretty frequently, when he was away, and\ncalled again in his dreams, when he was asleep. He wouldn't go into the\nroom where the tragedy had happened. This charmed the doting Mrs. Pratt,\nwho realized now, \"as she had never done before,\" she said, what a\nsensitive and delicate nature her darling had, and how he adored his poor\nuncle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20 -- The Murderer Chuckles\n\n     _Even the clearest and most perfect circumstantial evidence\n     is likely to be at fault, after all, and therefore ought to\n     be received with great caution. Take the case of any pencil,\n     sharpened by any woman; if you have witnesses, you will find\n     she did it with a knife; but if you take simply the aspect\n     of the pencil, you will say she did it with her teeth._\n     --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n\nThe weeks dragged along, no friend visiting the jailed twins but their\ncounsel and Aunt Patsy Cooper, and the day of trial came at last--the\nheaviest day in Wilson's life; for with all his tireless diligence he had\ndiscovered no sign or trace of the missing confederate. \"Confederate\"\nwas the term he had long ago privately accepted for that person--not as\nbeing unquestionably the right term, but as being the least possibly the\nright one, though he was never able to understand why the twins did not\nvanish and escape, as the confederate had done, instead of remaining by\nthe murdered man and getting caught there.\n\nThe courthouse was crowded, of course, and would remain so to the finish,\nfor not only in the town itself, but in the country for miles around, the\ntrial was the one topic of conversation among the people. Mrs. Pratt, in\ndeep mourning, and Tom with a weed on his hat, had seats near Pembroke\nHoward, the public prosecutor, and back of them sat a great array of\nfriends of the family. The twins had but one friend present to keep\ntheir counsel in countenance, their poor old sorrowing landlady. She sat\nnear Wilson, and looked her friendliest. In the \"nigger corner\" sat\nChambers; also Roxy, with good clothes on, and her bill of sale in her\npocket. It was her most precious possession, and she never parted with\nit, day or night. Tom had allowed her thirty-five dollars a month ever\nsince he came into his property, and had said that he and she ought to be\ngrateful to the twins for making them rich; but had roused such a temper\nin her by this speech that he did not repeat the argument afterward. She\nsaid the old judge had treated her child a thousand times better than he\ndeserved, and had never done her an unkindness in his life; so she hated\nthese outlandish devils for killing him, and shouldn't ever sleep\nsatisfied till she saw them hanged for it. She was here to watch the\ntrial now, and was going to lift up just one \"hooraw\" over it if the\ncounty judge put her in jail a year for it. She gave her turbaned head a\ntoss and said, \"When dat verdic' comes, I's gwine to lif' dat ROOF, now,\nI TELL you.\"\n\nPembroke Howard briefly sketched the state's case. He said he would show\nby a chain of circumstantial evidence without break or fault in it\nanywhere, that the principal prisoner at the bar committed the murder;\nthat the motive was partly revenge, and partly a desire to take his own\nlife out of jeopardy, and that his brother, by his presence, was a\nconsenting accessory to the crime; a crime which was the basest known to\nthe calendar of human misdeeds--assassination; that it was conceived by\nthe blackest of hearts and consummated by the cowardliest of hands; a\ncrime which had broken a loving sister's heart, blighted the happiness of\na young nephew who was as dear as a son, brought inconsolable grief to\nmany friends, and sorrow and loss to the whole community. The utmost\npenalty of the outraged law would be exacted, and upon the accused, now\npresent at the bar, that penalty would unquestionably be executed. He\nwould reserve further remark until his closing speech.\n\nHe was strongly moved, and so also was the whole house; Mrs. Pratt and\nseveral other women were weeping when he sat down, and many an eye that\nwas full of hate was riveted upon the unhappy prisoners.\n\nWitness after witness was called by the state, and questioned at length;\nbut the cross questioning was brief. Wilson knew they could furnish\nnothing valuable for his side. People were sorry for Pudd'nhead Wilson;\nhis budding career would get hurt by this trial.\n\nSeveral witnesses swore they heard Judge Driscoll say in his public\nspeech that the twins would be able to find their lost knife again when\nthey needed it to assassinate somebody with. This was not news, but now\nit was seen to have been sorrowfully prophetic, and a profound sensation\nquivered through the hushed courtroom when those dismal words were\nrepeated.\n\nThe public prosecutor rose and said that it was within his knowledge,\nthrough a conversation held with Judge Driscoll on the last day of his\nlife, that counsel for the defense had brought him a challenge from the\nperson charged at the bar with murder; that he had refused to fight with\na confessed assassin--\"that is, on the field of honor,\" but had added\nsignificantly, that he would be ready for him elsewhere. Presumably\nthe person here charged with murder was warned that he must kill or be\nkilled the first time he should meet Judge Driscoll. If counsel for the\ndefense chose to let the statement stand so, he would not call him to the\nwitness stand. Mr. Wilson said he would offer no denial. [Murmurs in the\nhouse: \"It is getting worse and worse for Wilson's case.\"]\n\nMrs. Pratt testified that she heard no outcry, and did not know what woke\nher up, unless it was the sound of rapid footsteps approaching the front\ndoor. She jumped up and ran out in the hall just as she was, and heard\nthe footsteps flying up the front steps and then following behind her as\nshe ran to the sitting room. There she found the accused standing over\nher murdered brother. [Here she broke down and sobbed. Sensation in the\ncourt.] Resuming, she said the persons entered behind her were Mr. Rogers\nand Mr. Buckstone.\n\nCross-examined by Wilson, she said the twins proclaimed their innocence;\ndeclared that they had been taking a walk, and had hurried to the house\nin response to a cry for help which was so loud and strong that they had\nheard it at a considerable distance; that they begged her and the\ngentlemen just mentioned to examine their hands and clothes--which was\ndone, and no blood stains found.\n\nConfirmatory evidence followed from Rogers and Buckstone.\n\nThe finding of the knife was verified, the advertisement minutely\ndescribing it and offering a reward for it was put in evidence, and its\nexact correspondence with that description proved. Then followed a few\nminor details, and the case for the state was closed.\n\nWilson said that he had three witnesses, the Misses Clarkson, who would\ntestify that they met a veiled young woman leaving Judge Driscoll's\npremises by the back gate a few minutes after the cries for help were\nheard, and that their evidence, taken with certain circumstantial\nevidence which he would call the court's attention to, would in his\nopinion convince the court that there was still one person concerned in\nthis crime who had not yet been found, and also that a stay of\nproceedings ought to be granted, in justice to his clients, until that\nperson should be discovered. As it was late, he would ask leave to defer\nthe examination of his three witnesses until the next morning.\n\nThe crowd poured out of the place and went flocking away in excited\ngroups and couples, taking the events of the session over with vivacity\nand consuming interest, and everybody seemed to have had a satisfactory\nand enjoyable day except the accused, their counsel, and their old lady\nfriend. There was no cheer among these, and no substantial hope.\n\nIn parting with the twins Aunt Patsy did attempt a good-night with a gay\npretense of hope and cheer in it, but broke down without finishing.\n\nAbsolutely secure as Tom considered himself to be, the opening\nsolemnities of the trial had nevertheless oppressed him with a vague\nuneasiness, his being a nature sensitive to even the smallest alarms; but\nfrom the moment that the poverty and weakness of Wilson's case lay\nexposed to the court, he was comfortable once more, even jubilant. He\nleft the courtroom sarcastically sorry for Wilson. \"The Clarksons met an\nunknown woman in the back lane,\" he said to himself, \"THAT is his case!\nI'll give him a century to find her in--a couple of them if he likes. A\nwoman who doesn't exist any longer, and the clothes that gave her her sex\nburnt up and the ashes thrown away--oh, certainly, he'll find HER easy\nenough!\" This reflection set him to admiring, for the hundredth time,\nthe shrewd ingenuities by which he had insured himself against\ndetection--more, against even suspicion.\n\n\"Nearly always in cases like this there is some little detail or other\noverlooked, some wee little track or trace left behind, and detection\nfollows; but here there's not even the faintest suggestion of a trace\nleft. No more than a bird leaves when it flies through the air--yes,\nthrough the night, you may say. The man that can track a bird through the\nair in the dark and find that bird is the man to track me out and find\nthe judge's assassin--no other need apply. And that is the job that has\nbeen laid out for poor Pudd'nhead Wilson, of all people in the world!\nLord, it will be pathetically funny to see him grubbing and groping after\nthat woman that don't exist, and the right person sitting under his very\nnose all the time!\" The more he thought the situation over, the more the\nhumor of it struck him. Finally he said, \"I'll never let him hear the\nlast of that woman. Every time I catch him in company, to his dying day,\nI'll ask him in the guileless affectionate way that used to gravel him so\nwhen I inquired how his unborn law business was coming along, 'Got on her\ntrack yet--hey, Pudd'nhead?'\" He wanted to laugh, but that would not\nhave answered; there were people about, and he was mourning for his\nuncle. He made up his mind that it would be good entertainment to look\nin on Wilson that night and watch him worry over his barren law case and\ngoad him with an exasperating word or two of sympathy and commiseration\nnow and then.\n\nWilson wanted no supper, he had no appetite. He got out all the\nfingerprints of girls and women in his collection of records and pored\ngloomily over them an hour or more, trying to convince himself that that\ntroublesome girl's marks were there somewhere and had been overlooked.\nBut it was not so. He drew back his chair, clasped his hands over his\nhead, and gave himself up to dull and arid musings.\n\nTom Driscoll dropped in, an hour after dark, and said with a pleasant\nlaugh as he took a seat:\n\n\"Hello, we've gone back to the amusements of our days of neglect and\nobscurity for consolation, have we?\" and he took up one of the glass\nstrips and held it against the light to inspect it. \"Come, cheer up, old\nman; there's no use in losing your grip and going back to this child's\nplay merely because this big sunspot is drifting across your shiny new\ndisk. It'll pass, and you'll be all right again\"--and he laid the glass\ndown. \"Did you think you could win always?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Wilson, with a sigh, \"I didn't expect that, but I can't\nbelieve Luigi killed your uncle, and I feel very sorry for him. It makes\nme blue. And you would feel as I do, Tom, if you were not prejudiced\nagainst those young fellows.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" and Tom's countenance darkened, for his memory\nreverted to his kicking. \"I owe them no good will, considering the\nbrunet one's treatment of me that night. Prejudice or no prejudice,\nPudd'nhead, I don't like them, and when they get their deserts you're not\ngoing to find me sitting on the mourner's bench.\"\n\nHe took up another strip of glass, and exclaimed:\n\n\"Why, here's old Roxy's label! Are you going to ornament the royal\npalaces with nigger paw marks, too? By the date here, I was seven months\nold when this was done, and she was nursing me and her little nigger cub.\nThere's a line straight across her thumbprint. How comes that?\" and Tom\nheld out the piece of glass to Wilson.\n\n\"That is common,\" said the bored man, wearily. \"Scar of a cut or a\nscratch, usually\"--and he took the strip of glass indifferently, and\nraised it toward the lamp.\n\nAll the blood sank suddenly out of his face; his hand quaked, and he\ngazed at the polished surface before him with the glassy stare of a\ncorpse.\n\n\"Great heavens, what's the matter with you, Wilson? Are you going to\nfaint?\"\n\nTom sprang for a glass of water and offered it, but Wilson shrank\nshuddering from him and said:\n\n\"No, no!--take it away!\" His breast was rising and falling, and he moved\nhis head about in a dull and wandering way, like a person who had been\nstunned. Presently he said, \"I shall feel better when I get to bed; I\nhave been overwrought today; yes, and overworked for many days.\"\n\n\"Then I'll leave you and let you get to your rest. Good night, old man.\"\nBut as Tom went out he couldn't deny himself a small parting gibe:\n\"Don't take it so hard; a body can't win every time; you'll hang somebody\nyet.\"\n\nWilson muttered to himself, \"It is no lie to say I am sorry I have to\nbegin with you, miserable dog though you are!\"\n\nHe braced himself up with a glass of cold whisky, and went to work again.\nHe did not compare the new finger marks unintentionally left by Tom a few\nminutes before on Roxy's glass with the tracings of the marks left on the\nknife handle, there being no need for that (for his trained eye), but\nbusied himself with another matter, muttering from time to time, \"Idiot\nthat I was!--Nothing but a GIRL would do me--a man in girl's clothes\nnever occurred to me.\" First, he hunted out the plate containing the\nfingerprints made by Tom when he was twelve years old, and laid it by\nitself; then he brought forth the marks made by Tom's baby fingers when\nhe was a suckling of seven months, and placed these two plates with the\none containing this subject's newly (and unconsciously) made record.\n\n\"Now the series is complete,\" he said with satisfaction, and sat down to\ninspect these things and enjoy them.\n\nBut his enjoyment was brief. He stared a considerable time at the three\nstrips, and seemed stupefied with astonishment. At last he put them down\nand said, \"I can't make it out at all--hang it, the baby's don't tally\nwith the others!\"\n\nHe walked the floor for half an hour puzzling over his enigma, then he\nhunted out the other glass plates.\n\nHe sat down and puzzled over these things a good while, but kept\nmuttering, \"It's no use; I can't understand it. They don't tally right,\nand yet I'll swear the names and dates are right, and so of course they\nOUGHT to tally. I never labeled one of these thing carelessly in my\nlife. There is a most extraordinary mystery here.\"\n\nHe was tired out now, and his brains were beginning to clog. He said he\nwould sleep himself fresh, and then see what he could do with this\nriddle. He slept through a troubled and unrestful hour, then\nunconsciousness began to shred away, and presently he rose drowsily to a\nsitting posture. \"Now what was that dream?\" he said, trying to recall\nit. \"What was that dream? It seemed to unravel that puz--\"\n\nHe landed in the middle of the floor at a bound, without finishing the\nsentence, and ran and turned up his light and seized his \"records.\" He\ntook a single swift glance at them and cried out:\n\n\"It's so! Heavens, what a revelation! And for twenty-three years no man\nhas ever suspected it!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21 -- Doom\n\n     _He is useless on top of the ground; he ought to be under\n     it, inspiring the cabbages._ --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n     _APRIL 1. This is the day upon which we are reminded of what\n     we are on the other three hundred and sixty-four._\n     --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n\nWilson put on enough clothes for business purposes and went to work\nunder a high pressure of steam. He was awake all over. All sense of\nweariness had been swept away by the invigorating refreshment of the\ngreat and hopeful discovery which he had made. He made fine and accurate\nreproductions of a number of his \"records,\" and then enlarged them on a\nscale of ten to one with his pantograph. He did these pantograph\nenlargements on sheets of white cardboard, and made each individual line\nof the bewildering maze of whorls or curves or loops which consisted of\nthe \"pattern\" of a \"record\" stand out bold and black by reinforcing it\nwith ink. To the untrained eye the collection of delicate originals made\nby the human finger on the glass plates looked about alike; but when\nenlarged ten times they resembled the markings of a block of wood that\nhas been sawed across the grain, and the dullest eye could detect at a\nglance, and at a distance of many feet, that no two of the patterns were\nalike. When Wilson had at last finished his tedious and difficult work,\nhe arranged his results according to a plan in which a progressive order\nand sequence was a principal feature; then he added to the batch several\npantograph enlargements which he had made from time to time in bygone\nyears.\n\nThe night was spent and the day well advanced now. By the time he had\nsnatched a trifle of breakfast, it was nine o'clock, and the court was\nready to begin its sitting. He was in his place twelve minutes later\nwith his \"records.\"\n\nTom Driscoll caught a slight glimpse of the records, and nudged his\nnearest friend and said, with a wink, \"Pudd'nhead's got a rare eye to\nbusiness--thinks that as long as he can't win his case it's at least a\nnoble good chance to advertise his window palace decorations without any\nexpense.\" Wilson was informed that his witnesses had been delayed, but\nwould arrive presently; but he rose and said he should probably not have\noccasion to make use of their testimony. [An amused murmur ran through\nthe room: \"It's a clean backdown! he gives up without hitting a lick!\"]\nWilson continued: \"I have other testimony--and better. [This compelled\ninterest, and evoked murmurs of surprise that had a detectable ingredient\nof disappointment in them.] If I seem to be springing this evidence upon\nthe court, I offer as my justification for this, that I did not discover\nits existence until late last night, and have been engaged in examining\nand classifying it ever since, until half an hour ago. I shall offer it\npresently; but first I wish to say a few preliminary words.\n\n\"May it please the court, the claim given the front place, the claim most\npersistently urged, the claim most strenuously and I may even say\naggressively and defiantly insisted upon by the prosecution is this--that\nthe person whose hand left the bloodstained fingerprints upon the handle\nof the Indian knife is the person who committed the murder.\" Wilson\npaused, during several moments, to give impressiveness to what he was\nabout to say, and then added tranquilly, \"WE GRANT THAT CLAIM.\"\n\nIt was an electrical surprise. No one was prepared for such an\nadmission. A buzz of astonishment rose on all sides, and people were\nheard to intimate that the overworked lawyer had lost his mind. Even the\nveteran judge, accustomed as he was to legal ambushes and masked\nbatteries in criminal procedure, was not sure that his ears were not\ndeceiving him, and asked counsel what it was he had said. Howard's\nimpassive face betrayed no sign, but his attitude and bearing lost\nsomething of their careless confidence for a moment. Wilson resumed:\n\n\"We not only grant that claim, but we welcome it and strongly endorse it.\nLeaving that matter for the present, we will now proceed to consider\nother points in the case which we propose to establish by evidence, and\nshall include that one in the chain in its proper place.\"\n\nHe had made up his mind to try a few hardy guesses, in mapping out his\ntheory of the origin and motive of the murder--guesses designed to fill\nup gaps in it--guesses which could help if they hit, and would probably\ndo no harm if they didn't.\n\n\"To my mind, certain circumstances of the case before the court seem to\nsuggest a motive for the homicide quite different from the one insisted\non by the state. It is my conviction that the motive was not revenge,\nbut robbery. It has been urged that the presence of the accused brothers\nin that fatal room, just after notification that one of them must take\nthe life of Judge Driscoll or lose his own the moment the parties should\nmeet, clearly signifies that the natural instinct of self-preservation\nmoved my clients to go there secretly and save Count Luigi by destroying\nhis adversary.\n\n\"Then why did they stay there, after the deed was done? Mrs. Pratt had\ntime, although she did not hear the cry for help, but woke up some\nmoments later, to run to that room--and there she found these men\nstanding and making no effort to escape. If they were guilty, they ought\nto have been running out of the house at the same time that she was\nrunning to that room. If they had had such a strong instinct toward\nself-preservation as to move them to kill that unarmed man, what had\nbecome of it now, when it should have been more alert than ever. Would\nany of us have remained there? Let us not slander our intelligence to\nthat degree.\n\n\"Much stress has been laid upon the fact that the accused offered a very\nlarge reward for the knife with which this murder was done; that no thief\ncame forward to claim that extraordinary reward; that the latter fact was\ngood circumstantial evidence that the claim that the knife had been\nstolen was a vanity and a fraud; that these details taken in connection\nwith the memorable and apparently prophetic speech of the deceased\nconcerning that knife, and the final discovery of that very knife in\nthe fatal room where no living person was found present with the\nslaughtered man but the owner of the knife and his brother, form an\nindestructible chain of evidence which fixed the crime upon those\nunfortunate strangers.\n\n\"But I shall presently ask to be sworn, and shall testify that there was\na large reward offered for the THIEF, also; and it was offered secretly\nand not advertised; that this fact was indiscreetly mentioned--or at\nleast tacitly admitted--in what was supposed to be safe circumstances,\nbut may NOT have been. The thief may have been present himself. [Tom\nDriscoll had been looking at the speaker, but dropped his eyes at this\npoint.] In that case he would retain the knife in his possession, not\ndaring to offer it for sale, or for pledge in a pawnshop. [There was a\nnodding of heads among the audience by way of admission that this was not\na bad stroke.] I shall prove to the satisfaction of the jury that there\nWAS a person in Judge Driscoll's room several minutes before the accused\nentered it. [This produced a strong sensation; the last drowsy head in\nthe courtroom roused up now, and made preparation to listen.] If it\nshall seem necessary, I will prove by the Misses Clarkson that they met a\nveiled person--ostensibly a woman--coming out of the back gate a few\nminutes after the cry for help was heard. This person was not a woman,\nbut a man dressed in woman's clothes.\" Another sensation. Wilson had his\neye on Tom when he hazarded this guess, to see what effect it would\nproduce. He was satisfied with the result, and said to himself, \"It was\na success--he's hit!\"\n\n\"The object of that person in that house was robbery, not murder. It is\ntrue that the safe was not open, but there was an ordinary cashbox on the\ntable, with three thousand dollars in it. It is easily supposable that\nthe thief was concealed in the house; that he knew of this box, and of\nits owner's habit of counting its contents and arranging his accounts at\nnight--if he had that habit, which I do not assert, of course--that he\ntried to take the box while its owner slept, but made a noise and was\nseized, and had to use the knife to save himself from capture; and that\nhe fled without his booty because he heard help coming.\n\n\"I have now done with my theory, and will proceed to the evidences by\nwhich I propose to try to prove its soundness.\" Wilson took up several of\nhis strips of glass. When the audience recognized these familiar\nmementos of Pudd'nhead's old time childish \"puttering\" and folly, the\ntense and funereal interest vanished out of their faces, and the house\nburst into volleys of relieving and refreshing laughter, and Tom chirked\nup and joined in the fun himself; but Wilson was apparently not\ndisturbed. He arranged his records on the table before him, and said:\n\n\"I beg the indulgence of the court while I make a few remarks in\nexplanation of some evidence which I am about to introduce, and which I\nshall presently ask to be allowed to verify under oath on the witness\nstand. Every human being carries with him from his cradle to his grave\ncertain physical marks which do not change their character, and by which\nhe can always be identified--and that without shade of doubt or question.\nThese marks are his signature, his physiological autograph, so to speak,\nand this autograph can not be counterfeited, nor can he disguise it or\nhide it away, nor can it become illegible by the wear and mutations of\ntime. This signature is not his face--age can change that beyond\nrecognition; it is not his hair, for that can fall out; it is not his\nheight, for duplicates of that exist; it is not his form, for duplicates\nof that exist also, whereas this signature is each man's very own--there\nis no duplicate of it among the swarming populations of the globe! [The\naudience were interested once more.]\n\n\"This autograph consists of the delicate lines or corrugations with which\nNature marks the insides of the hands and the soles of the feet. If you\nwill look at the balls of your fingers--you that have very sharp\neyesight--you will observe that these dainty curving lines lie close\ntogether, like those that indicate the borders of oceans in maps, and\nthat they form various clearly defined patterns, such as arches, circles,\nlong curves, whorls, etc., and that these patterns differ on the different\nfingers. [Every man in the room had his hand up to the light now, and\nhis head canted to one side, and was minutely scrutinizing the balls of\nhis fingers; there were whispered ejaculations of 'Why, it's so--I never\nnoticed that before!'] The patterns on the right hand are not the same as\nthose on the left. [Ejaculations of 'Why, that's so, too!'] Taken finger\nfor finger, your patterns differ from your neighbor's. [Comparisons were\nmade all over the house--even the judge and jury were absorbed in this\ncurious work.] The patterns of a twin's right hand are not the same as\nthose on his left. One twin's patterns are never the same as his fellow\ntwin's patterns--the jury will find that the patterns upon the finger\nballs of the twins' hands follow this rule. [An examination of the\ntwins' hands was begun at once.] You have often heard of twins who were\nso exactly alike that when dressed alike their own parents could not tell\nthem apart. Yet there was never a twin born in to this world that did not\ncarry from birth to death a sure identifier in this mysterious and\nmarvelous natal autograph. That once known to you, his fellow twin could\nnever personate him and deceive you.\"\n\nWilson stopped and stood silent. Inattention dies a quick and sure death\nwhen a speaker does that. The stillness gives warning that something is\ncoming. All palms and finger balls went down now, all slouching forms\nstraightened, all heads came up, all eyes were fastened upon Wilson's\nface. He waited yet one, two, three moments, to let his pause complete\nand perfect its spell upon the house; then, when through the profound\nhush he could hear the ticking of the clock on the wall, he put out his\nhand and took the Indian knife by the blade and held it aloft where all\ncould see the sinister spots upon its ivory handle; then he said, in a\nlevel and passionless voice:\n\n\"Upon this haft stands the assassin's natal autograph, written in the\nblood of that helpless and unoffending old man who loved you and whom you\nall loved. There is but one man in the whole earth whose hand can\nduplicate that crimson sign\"--he paused and raised his eyes to the\npendulum swinging back and forth--\"and please God we will produce that\nman in this room before the clock strikes noon!\"\n\nStunned, distraught, unconscious of its own movement, the house half\nrose, as if expecting to see the murderer appear at the door, and a\nbreeze of muttered ejaculations swept the place. \"Order in the\ncourt!--sit down!\" This from the sheriff. He was obeyed, and quiet\nreigned again. Wilson stole a glance at Tom, and said to himself, \"He is\nflying signals of distress now; even people who despise him are pitying\nhim; they think this is a hard ordeal for a young fellow who has lost his\nbenefactor by so cruel a stroke--and they are right.\" He resumed his\nspeech:\n\n\"For more than twenty years I have amused my compulsory leisure with\ncollecting these curious physical signatures in this town. At my house I\nhave hundreds upon hundreds of them. Each and every one is labeled with\nname and date; not labeled the next day or even the next hour, but in the\nvery minute that the impression was taken. When I go upon the witness\nstand I will repeat under oath the things which I am now saying. I have\nthe fingerprints of the court, the sheriff, and every member of the jury.\nThere is hardly a person in this room, white or black, whose natal\nsignature I cannot produce, and not one of them can so disguise himself\nthat I cannot pick him out from a multitude of his fellow creatures and\nunerringly identify him by his hands. And if he and I should live to be a\nhundred I could still do it. [The interest of the audience was steadily\ndeepening now.]\n\n\"I have studied some of these signatures so much that I know them as well\nas the bank cashier knows the autograph of his oldest customer. While I\nturn my back now, I beg that several persons will be so good as to pass\ntheir fingers through their hair, and then press them upon one of the\npanes of the window near the jury, and that among them the accused may\nset THEIR finger marks. Also, I beg that these experimenters, or others,\nwill set their fingers upon another pane, and add again the marks of the\naccused, but not placing them in the same order or relation to the other\nsignatures as before--for, by one chance in a million, a person might\nhappen upon the right marks by pure guesswork, ONCE, therefore I wish to\nbe tested twice.\"\n\nHe turned his back, and the two panes were quickly covered with\ndelicately lined oval spots, but visible only to such persons as could\nget a dark background for them--the foliage of a tree, outside, for\ninstance. Then upon call, Wilson went to the window, made his\nexamination, and said:\n\n\"This is Count Luigi's right hand; this one, three signatures below, is\nhis left. Here is Count Angelo's right; down here is his left. Now for\nthe other pane: here and here are Count Luigi's, here and here are his\nbrother's.\" He faced about. \"Am I right?\"\n\nA deafening explosion of applause was the answer. The bench said:\n\n\"This certainly approaches the miraculous!\"\n\nWilson turned to the window again and remarked, pointing with his finger:\n\n\"This is the signature of Mr. Justice Robinson. [Applause.] This, of\nConstable Blake. [Applause.] This of John Mason, juryman. [Applause.]\nThis, of the sheriff. [Applause.] I cannot name the others, but I have\nthem all at home, named and dated, and could identify them all by my\nfingerprint records.\"\n\nHe moved to his place through a storm of applause--which the sheriff\nstopped, and also made the people sit down, for they were all standing\nand struggling to see, of course. Court, jury, sheriff, and everybody\nhad been too absorbed in observing Wilson's performance to attend to the\naudience earlier.\n\n\"Now then,\" said Wilson, \"I have here the natal autographs of the two\nchildren--thrown up to ten times the natural size by the pantograph, so\nthat anyone who can see at all can tell the markings apart at a glance.\nWe will call the children A and B. Here are A's finger marks, taken at\nthe age of five months. Here they are again taken at seven months. [Tom\nstarted.] They are alike, you see. Here are B's at five months, and also\nat seven months. They, too, exactly copy each other, but the patterns\nare quite different from A's, you observe. I shall refer to these again\npresently, but we will turn them face down now.\n\n\"Here, thrown up ten sizes, are the natal autographs of the two persons\nwho are here before you accused of murdering Judge Driscoll. I made these\npantograph copies last night, and will so swear when I go upon the\nwitness stand. I ask the jury to compare them with the finger marks of\nthe accused upon the windowpanes, and tell the court if they are the\nsame.\"\n\nHe passed a powerful magnifying glass to the foreman.\n\nOne juryman after another took the cardboard and the glass and made the\ncomparison. Then the foreman said to the judge:\n\n\"Your honor, we are all agreed that they are identical.\"\n\nWilson said to the foreman:\n\n\"Please turn that cardboard face down, and take this one, and compare it\nsearchingly, by the magnifier, with the fatal signature upon the knife\nhandle, and report your finding to the court.\"\n\nAgain the jury made minute examinations, and again reported:\n\n\"We find them to be exactly identical, your honor.\"\n\nWilson turned toward the counsel for the prosecution, and there was a\nclearly recognizable note of warning in his voice when he said:\n\n\"May it please the court, the state has claimed, strenuously and\npersistently, that the bloodstained fingerprints upon that knife handle\nwere left there by the assassin of Judge Driscoll. You have heard us\ngrant that claim, and welcome it.\" He turned to the jury: \"Compare the\nfingerprints of the accused with the fingerprints left by the\nassassin--and report.\"\n\nThe comparison began. As it proceeded, all movement and all sound\nceased, and the deep silence of an absorbed and waiting suspense settled\nupon the house; and when at last the words came, \"THEY DO NOT EVEN\nRESEMBLE,\" a thundercrash of applause followed and the house sprang to\nits feet, but was quickly repressed by official force and brought to\norder again. Tom was altering his position every few minutes now, but\nnone of his changes brought repose nor any small trifle of comfort. When\nthe house's attention was become fixed once more, Wilson said gravely,\nindicating the twins with a gesture:\n\n\"These men are innocent--I have no further concern with them. [Another\noutbreak of applause began, but was promptly checked.] We will now\nproceed to find the guilty. [Tom's eyes were starting from their\nsockets--yes, it was a cruel day for the bereaved youth, everybody\nthought.] We will return to the infant autographs of A and B. I will\nask the jury to take these large pantograph facsimilies of A's marked\nfive months and seven months. Do they tally?\"\n\nThe foreman responded: \"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Now examine this pantograph, taken at eight months, and also marked A.\nDoes it tally with the other two?\"\n\nThe surprised response was:\n\n\"NO--THEY DIFFER WIDELY!\"\n\n\"You are quite right. Now take these two pantographs of B's autograph,\nmarked five months and seven months. Do they tally with each other?\"\n\n\"Yes--perfectly.\"\n\n\"Take this third pantograph marked B, eight months. Does it tally with\nB's other two?\"\n\n\"BY NO MEANS!\"\n\n\"Do you know how to account for those strange discrepancies? I will tell\nyou. For a purpose unknown to us, but probably a selfish one, somebody\nchanged those children in the cradle.\"\n\nThis produced a vast sensation, naturally; Roxana was astonished at this\nadmirable guess, but not disturbed by it. To guess the exchange was one\nthing, to guess who did it quite another. Pudd'nhead Wilson could do\nwonderful things, no doubt, but he couldn't do impossible ones. Safe?\nShe was perfectly safe. She smiled privately.\n\n\"Between the ages of seven months and eight months those children were\nchanged in the cradle\"--he made one of this effect--collecting pauses,\nand added--\"and the person who did it is in this house!\"\n\nRoxy's pulses stood still! The house was thrilled as with an electric\nshock, and the people half rose as if to seek a glimpse of the person who\nhad made that exchange. Tom was growing limp; the life seemed oozing out\nof him. Wilson resumed:\n\n\"A was put into B's cradle in the nursery; B was transferred to the\nkitchen and became a Negro and a slave [Sensation--confusion of angry\nejaculations]--but within a quarter of an hour he will stand before you\nwhite and free! [Burst of applause, checked by the officers.] From\nseven months onward until now, A has still been a usurper, and in my\nfinger record he bears B's name. Here is his pantograph at the age of\ntwelve. Compare it with the assassin's signature upon the knife handle.\nDo they tally?\"\n\nThe foreman answered:\n\n\"TO THE MINUTEST DETAIL!\"\n\nWilson said, solemnly:\n\n\"The murderer of your friend and mine--York Driscoll of the generous hand\nand the kindly spirit--sits in among you. Valet de Chambre, Negro and\nslave--falsely called Thomas a Becket Driscoll--make upon the window the\nfingerprints that will hang you!\"\n\nTom turned his ashen face imploring toward the speaker, made some\nimpotent movements with his white lips, then slid limp and lifeless to\nthe floor.\n\nWilson broke the awed silence with the words:\n\n\"There is no need. He has confessed.\"\n\nRoxy flung herself upon her knees, covered her face with her hands, and\nout through her sobs the words struggled:\n\n\"De Lord have mercy on me, po' misasble sinner dat I is!\"\n\nThe clock struck twelve.\n\nThe court rose; the new prisoner, handcuffed, was removed.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n     _It is often the case that the man who can't tell a lie\n     thinks he is the best judge of one._ --Pudd'nhead Wilson's\n     Calendar\n\n     _OCTOBER 12, THE DISCOVERY. It was wonderful to find\n     America, but it would have been more wonderful to miss it._\n     --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar\n\n\nThe town sat up all night to discuss the amazing events of the day and\nswap guesses as to when Tom's trial would begin. Troop after troop of\ncitizens came to serenade Wilson, and require a speech, and shout\nthemselves hoarse over every sentence that fell from his lips--for all\nhis sentences were golden, now, all were marvelous. His long fight\nagainst hard luck and prejudice was ended; he was a made man for good.\nAnd as each of these roaring gangs of enthusiasts marched away, some\nremorseful member of it was quite sure to raise his voice and say:\n\n\"And this is the man the likes of us have called a pudd'nhead for more\nthan twenty years. He has resigned from that position, friends.\"\n\n\"Yes, but it isn't vacant--we're elected.\"\n\nThe twins were heroes of romance, now, and with rehabilitated\nreputations. But they were weary of Western adventure, and straightway\nretired to Europe.\n\nRoxy's heart was broken. The young fellow upon whom she had inflicted\ntwenty-three years of slavery continued the false heir's pension of\nthirty-five dollars a month to her, but her hurts were too deep for money\nto heal; the spirit in her eye was quenched, her martial bearing departed\nwith it, and the voice of her laughter ceased in the land. In her church\nand its affairs she found her only solace.\n\nThe real heir suddenly found himself rich and free, but in a most\nembarrassing situation. He could neither read nor write, and his speech\nwas the basest dialect of the Negro quarter. His gait, his attitudes, his\ngestures, his bearing, his laugh--all were vulgar and uncouth; his\nmanners were the manners of a slave. Money and fine clothes could not\nmend these defects or cover them up; they only made them more glaring and\nthe more pathetic. The poor fellow could not endure the terrors of the\nwhite man's parlor, and felt at home and at peace nowhere but in the\nkitchen. The family pew was a misery to him, yet he could nevermore enter\ninto the solacing refuge of the \"nigger gallery\"--that was closed to him\nfor good and all. But we cannot follow his curious fate further--that\nwould be a long story.\n\nThe false heir made a full confession and was sentenced to imprisonment\nfor life. But now a complication came up. The Percy Driscoll estate was\nin such a crippled shape when its owner died that it could pay only sixty\npercent of its great indebtedness, and was settled at that rate. But the\ncreditors came forward now, and complained that inasmuch as through an\nerror for which THEY were in no way to blame the false heir was not\ninventoried at the time with the rest of the property, great wrong and\nloss had thereby been inflicted upon them. They rightly claimed that\n\"Tom\" was lawfully their property and had been so for eight years; that\nthey had already lost sufficiently in being deprived of his services\nduring that long period, and ought not to be required to add anything to\nthat loss; that if he had been delivered up to them in the first place,\nthey would have sold him and he could not have murdered Judge Driscoll;\ntherefore it was not that he had really committed the murder, the guilt\nlay with the erroneous inventory. Everybody saw that there was reason in\nthis. Everybody granted that if \"Tom\" were white and free it would be\nunquestionably right to punish him--it would be no loss to anybody; but\nto shut up a valuable slave for life--that was quite another matter.\n\nAs soon as the Governor understood the case, he pardoned Tom at once, and\nthe creditors sold him down the river.\n\n\n\n\n\nAUTHOR'S NOTE TO \"THOSE EXTRAORDINARY TWINS\"\n\nA man who is not born with the novel-writing gift has a troublesome time\nof it when he tries to build a novel. I know this from experience. He\nhas no clear idea of his story; in fact he has no story. He merely has\nsome people in his mind, and an incident or two, also a locality, and he\ntrusts he can plunge those people into those incidents with interesting\nresults. So he goes to work. To write a novel? No--that is a thought\nwhich comes later; in the beginning he is only proposing to tell a little\ntale, a very little tale, a six-page tale. But as it is a tale which he\nis not acquainted with, and can only find out what it is by listening as\nit goes along telling itself, it is more than apt to go on and on and on\ntill it spreads itself into a book. I know about this, because it has\nhappened to me so many times.\n\nAnd I have noticed another thing: that as the short tale grows into the\nlong tale, the original intention (or motif) is apt to get abolished and\nfind itself superseded by a quite different one. It was so in the case\nof a magazine sketch which I once started to write--a funny and fantastic\nsketch about a prince and a pauper; it presently assumed a grave cast of\nits own accord, and in that new shape spread itself out into a book. Much\nthe same thing happened with PUDD'NHEAD WILSON. I had a sufficiently\nhard time with that tale, because it changed itself from a farce to a\ntragedy while I was going along with it--a most embarrassing\ncircumstance. But what was a great deal worse was, that it was not one\nstory, but two stories tangled together; and they obstructed and\ninterrupted each other at every turn and created no end of confusion and\nannoyance. I could not offer the book for publication, for I was afraid\nit would unseat the reader's reason, I did not know what was the matter\nwith it, for I had not noticed, as yet, that it was two stories in one.\nIt took me months to make that discovery. I carried the manuscript back\nand forth across the Atlantic two or three times, and read it and studied\nover it on shipboard; and at last I saw where the difficulty lay. I had\nno further trouble. I pulled one of the stories out by the roots, and\nleft the other--a kind of literary Caesarean operation.\n\nWould the reader care to know something about the story which I pulled\nout? He has been told many a time how the born-and-trained novelist\nworks; won't he let me round and complete his knowledge by telling him\nhow the jackleg does it?\n\nOriginally the story was called THOSE EXTRAORDINARY TWINS. I meant to\nmake it very short. I had seen a picture of a youthful Italian\n\"freak\"--or \"freaks\"--which was--or which were--on exhibition in our\ncities--a combination consisting of two heads and four arms joined to a\nsingle body and a single pair of legs--and I thought I would write an\nextravagantly fantastic little story with this freak of nature for\nhero--or heroes--a silly young miss for heroine, and two old ladies and\ntwo boys for the minor parts. I lavishly elaborated these people and\ntheir doings, of course. But the tale kept spreading along and spreading\nalong, and other people got to intruding themselves and taking up more\nand more room with their talk and their affairs. Among them came a\nstranger named Pudd'nhead Wilson, and a woman named Roxana; and presently\nthe doings of these two pushed up into prominence a young fellow named\nTom Driscoll, whose proper place was away in the obscure background.\nBefore the book was half finished those three were taking things almost\nentirely into their own hands and working the whole tale as a private\nventure of their own--a tale which they had nothing at all to do with, by\nrights.\n\nWhen the book was finished and I came to look around to see what had\nbecome of the team I had originally started out with--Aunt Patsy Cooper,\nAunt Betsy Hale, and two boys, and Rowena the lightweight heroine--they\nwere nowhere to be seen; they had disappeared from the story some time or\nother. I hunted about and found them--found them stranded, idle,\nforgotten, and permanently useless. It was very awkward. It was awkward\nall around, but more particularly in the case of Rowena, because there\nwas a love match on, between her and one of the twins that constituted\nthe freak, and I had worked it up to a blistering heat and thrown in a\nquite dramatic love quarrel, wherein Rowena scathingly denounced her\nbetrothed for getting drunk, and scoffed at his explanation of how it had\nhappened, and wouldn't listen to it, and had driven him from her in the\nusual \"forever\" way; and now here she sat crying and brokenhearted; for\nshe had found that he had spoken only the truth; that it was not he, but\nthe other of the freak that had drunk the liquor that made him drunk;\nthat her half was a prohibitionist and had never drunk a drop in his\nlife, and altogether tight as a brick three days in the week, was wholly\ninnocent of blame; and indeed, when sober, was constantly doing all he\ncould to reform his brother, the other half, who never got any\nsatisfaction out of drinking, anyway, because liquor never affected him.\nYes, here she was, stranded with that deep injustice of hers torturing\nher poor torn heart.\n\nI didn't know what to do with her. I was as sorry for her as anybody\ncould be, but the campaign was over, the book was finished, she was\nsidetracked, and there was no possible way of crowding her in, anywhere.\nI could not leave her there, of course; it would not do. After spreading\nher out so, and making such a to-do over her affairs, it would be\nabsolutely necessary to account to the reader for her. I thought and\nthought and studied and studied; but I arrived at nothing. I finally saw\nplainly that there was really no way but one--I must simply give her the\ngrand bounce. It grieved me to do it, for after associating with her so\nmuch I had come to kind of like her after a fashion, notwithstanding she\nwas such an ass and said such stupid, irritating things and was so\nnauseatingly sentimental. Still it had to be done. So at the top of\nChapter XVII I put a \"Calendar\" remark concerning July the Fourth, and\nbegan the chapter with this statistic:\n\n\"Rowena went out in the backyard after supper to see the fireworks and\nfell down the well and got drowned.\"\n\nIt seemed abrupt, but I thought maybe the reader wouldn't notice it,\nbecause I changed the subject right away to something else. Anyway it\nloosened up Rowena from where she was stuck and got her out of the way,\nand that was the main thing. It seemed a prompt good way of weeding out\npeople that had got stalled, and a plenty good enough way for those\nothers; so I hunted up the two boys and said, \"They went out back one\nnight to stone the cat and fell down the well and got drowned.\" Next I\nsearched around and found old Aunt Patsy and Aunt Betsy Hale where they\nwere around, and said, \"They went out back one night to visit the sick\nand fell down the well and got drowned.\" I was going to drown some\nothers, but I gave up the idea, partly because I believed that if I kept\nthat up it would arouse attention, and perhaps sympathy with those people,\nand partly because it was not a large well and would not hold any more\nanyway.\n\nStill the story was unsatisfactory. Here was a set of new characters who\nwere become inordinately prominent and who persisted in remaining so to\nthe end; and back yonder was an older set who made a large noise and a\ngreat to-do for a little while and then suddenly played out utterly and\nfell down the well. There was a radical defect somewhere, and I must\nsearch it out and cure it.\n\nThe defect turned out to be the one already spoken of--two stories in\none, a farce and a tragedy. So I pulled out the farce and left the\ntragedy. This left the original team in, but only as mere names, not as\ncharacters. Their prominence was wholly gone; they were not even worth\ndrowning; so I removed that detail. Also I took the twins apart and made\ntwo separate men of them. They had no occasion to have foreign names now,\nbut it was too much trouble to remove them all through, so I left them\nchristened as they were and made no explanation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson, by\nMark Twain (Samuel Clemens)\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TRAGEDY OF PUDD'NHEAD WILSON ***\n\n***** This file should be named 102.txt or 102.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/0\/102\/\n\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":297,"split":"train"}
