{"ori_id":"fc7187dffd2fe9018b288b0d81c5e049ce0ad716","title":"Jack the Giant Killer","context":"Jack the Giant Killer\n This plot summary is based on a text published ca. 1760 by John Cotton and Joshua Eddowes, which in its turn was based on a chapbook ca. 1711, and reprinted in 'The Classic Fairy Tales' by Iona and Peter Opie in 1974.\nThe tale is set during the reign of King Arthur and tells of a young Cornish farmer's son named Jack who is not only strong but so clever he easily confounds the learned with his penetrating wit. Jack encounters a cattle-eating giant called Cormoran (Cornish: 'The Giant of the Sea' SWF:Kowr-Mor-An) and lures him to his death in a pit trap. Jack is dubbed 'Jack the Giant-Killer' for this feat and receives not only the giant's wealth, but a sword and belt to commemorate the event. Another giant named Blunderbore vows vengeance for Cormoran's death and carries Jack off to an enchanted castle. Jack manages to slay Blunderbore and his brother Rebecks by hanging and stabbing them. He frees three ladies held captive in the giant's castle.\nOn a trip into Wales, Jack tricks a two-headed Welsh giant into slashing his own belly open. King Arthur's son now enters the story and Jack becomes his servant. They spend the night with a three-headed giant and rob him in the morning. In gratitude for having spared his castle, the three-headed giant gives Jack a magic sword, a cap of knowledge, a cloak of invisibility, and shoes of swiftness. On the road, Jack and the Prince meet an enchanted Lady serving Lucifer. Jack breaks the spell with his magic accessories, beheads Lucifer, and the Lady marries the Prince. Jack is rewarded with membership in the Round Table.\nJack ventures forth alone with his magic shoes, sword, cloak, and cap to rid the realm of troublesome giants. He encounters a giant terrorizing a knight and his lady. He cuts off the giant's legs then puts him to death. He discovers the giant's companion in a cave. Invisible in his cloak, Jack cuts off the giant's nose then slays him by plunging his sword into the monster's back. He frees the giant's captives and returns to the house of the knight and lady he earlier had rescued. A banquet is prepared, but it is interrupted by the two-headed giant Thunderdel chanting \"Fee, fau, fum\". Jack defeats and beheads the giant with a trick involving the house's moat and drawbridge.\nGrowing weary of the festivities, Jack sallies forth for more adventures and meets an elderly man who directs him to an enchanted castle belonging to the giant Galigantus (Galligantua, in the Joseph Jacobs version). The giant holds captive many knights and ladies and a Duke's daughter who has been transformed into a white doe through the power of a sorcerer. Jack beheads the giant, the sorcerer flees, the Duke's daughter is restored to her true shape, and the captives are freed.\nAt the court of King Arthur, Jack marries the Duke's daughter and the two are given an estate where they live happily ever after.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Jack The Giant Killer, by Percival Leigh\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

portentous meteors, they\n     Glimmered, glowed, and flashed away;\n\n     His cheeks and nose were fiery too;\n             Like wire on his chin the bristles grew;\n             And his tangled locks hung down his back,\n             Like the legs of a Brobdignag spider so black;\n             Ready, the thickest skull to crack\n             That ever county member wore,\n     His iron club beside him lay.\n\n     He was in a terrible way,\n             For he voted his brother's not coming a bore.\n\n\n     VIII.\n\n             The hero, Jack, dismounts to dress--\n             What was his toilet you may guess;\n\n{041}\n\n         So may I be ever dight\n         When I bow me for the fight.\n\n\n     IX.\n\n\n     Like a cliff o'er ocean lowering,\n     Or some old and cross curmudgeon\n     Waiting, dinnerless, in dudgeon,\n     Sits the Giant glumly glowering.\n\n     Hears he not a whisper say,\n     \"So there you are, old rascal, eh? \"\n     Hears he not a step approaching,\n     Though he may n't the comer see?\n     No; like rogue by streamlet poaching,\n     Creeps Jack near him stealthily.\n\n\n[Illustration: 071]\n\n\n     X.\n\n\n     As when some school-boy--idle thief--\n     With double-knotted handkerchief,\n     What time his comrade stooping low,\n     With tightened skin invites the blow;\n     With sundry feints, delays to smite,\n     And baulks, to linger out delight;\n     So Jack, with thorough-going blade,\n     Stood aiming at the Giant's head.\n\n     At last the champion cried, \"Here goes\n     Struck, and cut off the monster's--nose.\n     Like a thousand bulls all roaring mad,\n     Was the furious Giant's shout,\n\n\n{042}\n\n\n     With the iron club, which I said he had,\n        Oh! how he laid about!\n     \"Oho! if that's your way, old cock,\n     We must finish the game,\" quoth Jack;\n     So he vaulted upon the chopping-block,\n        And ran him through the back.\n\n     The Giant howled; the rocks around\n         Thrilled with his demon squall,\n     Then flat he fell upon the ground,\n        As the Monument might fall.\n\n\n     XI.\n\n\n     The Giants slain, the Cornish man\n     Despatched their gory heads by van\n     To great King Arthur;--gifts more queer\n     Have ne'er been sent to our Sovereign dear.\n     She gets gigantic cheeses, cakes,\n     Which loyal-hearted subject makes;\n     Gigantic peaches, melons, pumpkins,\n     Presented by her faithful bumpkins;\n     And giant heads of brocoli--not\n     The heads of Giants sent to pot--\n     Long may such heads, and such alone,\n     Be laid before her stainless throne!\n\n\n     XII.\n\n\n     Now Jack the darksome den explores,\n     And through its turns and windings pores,\n     'Till to a spacious hall he comes,\n     Where, o'er the hearth, a cauldron hums,\n     Much like a knacker's in the slums;\n\n\n{043}\n\n\n     Hard by, a squalid table stood,\n     All foul with fat, and brains, and blood;\n     The two great Ogres' carrion food.\n\n     Through iron grate, the board beside,\n     Pale captive wretches he descried;\n     Who, when they saw the hero, cried,\n     \"Alas! here

vain,\n         Behold, my bucks of brass, you 're free!\"\n         And he brast the bars right speedily.\n\n     To meat they went, and, supper done,\n     To the treasury they hied each one\n          And filled their pockets full of money.\n     What Giants could want with silver and gold,\n     In sooth tradition hath not told:--\n         'T is a question rather funny.\n\n\n     XIII.\n\n\n              The very next day\n              The rest went away,\n     To their dear little wives and their daughters,\n     But Jack to the knight's\n     Repairs with delights\n     To recruit

 They decked his finger with a ring\n                    Of gold that with the diamond shone--\n     This motto was engraved thereon:--\n\n                                         See Page Image==>

         Who larruped the Giants out-and-out;\n               When, lo! all their mirth was changed to gloom,\n     For a herald, all whey-faced, rushed into the room.\n\n                Oh, the horrified wight!\n     What a terrible sight!\n     He spoke--five hundred jaws were still;\n     Eyes, twice five hundred, staring wide--\n               \"Mac Thundel's coming, bent to kill\n

\"Gentles and ladies, pray walk below\n       To the castle yard with me;\n       You don't object to sport I know,\n       And rare sport you shall see.\"\n\n       \"Success to gallant Jack!\" they shout,\n       And follow, straight, the champion stout.\n       The knight's retainers he summons, all hands,\n       And thus with hasty speech commands:-\n\n       \"Ho! merrymen, all, to the

died?\n     Then 'a will tear thee wi' my fangs,\n     And quaff thy bluid to quit thy wrangs!\"\n     \"You must catch me first, old stupid ass!\"\n     Said Jack--he quoted Mrs. Glass;\n     And he scampers away in his nimble shoes:\n     Like a walking Ben Lomond, Mac Thundel pursues.\n\n                      In and out,\n                      Round about,\n               Jack dodges the Giant apace,\n                      Round the castle wall,\n                      That the guests may all\n               Enjoy the stirring chase.\n\n     O'er the drawbridge he courses, mid shouts of laughter\n     Mac Thundel heavily flounders after,\n     Whirling his mace around his head:--\n     The drawbridge groans beneath his tread--\n     It creaks--it crashes--he tumbles in,\n     Very nearly up to his chin,\n     Amid the assembled company's jeers,\n     Who hail his fall with \"ironical cheers.\"\n\n\n{047}\n\n     He roars, rolls, splashes, and behaves\n     Much like some monster of the waves,\n     When \"sleeping on the Norway foam,\"\n     The barb\u00c3\u00a9d harpoon strikes him home.\n\n     By the side of the moat Jack, standing safe,\n     Begins the Giant thus to chafe;--\n     \"Just now, old chap, I thought you said\n     You'd grind my bones to make your bread.\"\n\n     Mac Thundel plunged from side to side,\n     But he could n't get out although he tried;\n     Sooth to say, he was thoroughly done--\n     \"Now,\" said Jack, \"we 'll end the fun.\n\n              Yon cart rope bring,\n              Ay--that's the thing!\"\n     And he cast it o'er the heads so big;\n              A team was at hand,\n     And he drew him to land,\n     While all the spectators cried, \"That's the rig!\"\n     His falchion gleams aloft in air,\n              It falls; the monster's heads, I ween,\n     Are off as quick as Frenchmen's e'er\n     Were severed by the guillotine.\n\n     With shouts of joy the castle rang,\n           And they hied them again to the festal cheer\n     Long life to brave Sir Jack they sang,\n           And they drank his health in floods of beer.\n\n\n{048}\n\n\n     XVII.\n\n\n     Awhile the hero now reposes,\n     In knightly hall an honoured guest;\n     His brow by beauty crowned with roses,\n     And filled his belly with the best.\n\n     But soon the life of idlesse palls,\n     For daring deeds his heart is \"game;\"\n     \"Farewell,\" he cries, \"ye lordly walls!\"\n     And starts anew in quest of fame.\n\n     Over hill and dale he wends;\n     Fate no fresh adventure sends\n     To reward him for his pains,\n     Till a mountain's foot he gains.\n\n     Underneath that hill prodigious\n     Dwelt an anchorite religious:\n     He batter'd the door with divers knocks;\n     He didn't make a little din;\n     And the hermit old, with his hoary locks,\n     Came forth at the summons to let him in\n     \"Reverend sire,\" cried Jack, \"I say,\n     Can you lodge a chap who has lost his way?\n     The grey-beard eremite answered \"Yea--\n     That is if thou cans't take 'pot luck.'\"\n\n     \"I rather think I can, old buck!\"\n     The hero answer made, and went\n     To supper with no small content.\n\n{049}\n\n\n     XX.\n\n\n     When Jack had eaten all he could,\n     Bespoke him thus the hermit good,-\n     \"My son, I think I 'twig' the man\n     Who 'slew the Giant Cormoran.'\n\n     On yonder hill-top a regular bad 'un\n     Dwells in a castle just like Haddon\n     (Haddon!--thou know'st its time-worn towers,\n     Drawn by ascertain friend of 'ours');\n     That Giant's name is Catawampus;\n     And much I fear he soon will swamp us,\n     Unless that arm--\" Cried Jack \"Enow;\n     He dies!\" The hermit said, \"Allow\n     Me to remark--you wo n't be daunted--\n     But know his castle is enchanted;\n     Him aids a sorcerer of might\n     Slockdollagos the villain's hight;\n     They crossed the main from western climes;\n     And here, confederate in crimes\n     (They term them 'notion's'), play their tricks;\n     Bold knights (to use their slang) they 'fix,'\n     Transforming them, at treacherous feasts,\n     With stuff called 'julep,' into beasts.\n\n     They served a duke's fair daughter so,\n     Whom they transmuted to a doe;\n     Hither they brought the maid forlorn,\n     On car by fiery dragons borne;\n     To free her, champions not a few\n     Have tried, but found it would n't do;\n\n\n{050}\n\n\n     Two griffins, breathing sulph'rous fire,\n     Destroy all those who venture nigh her;\n     But thee thy coat will keep secure.\"\n\n     Jack answered gaily, \"To be sure; \"\n     And swore that when the morning came,\n     He 'd lose his life or free the dame.\n\n\n     XXI.\n\n\n     Now Night o'er earth her pall had spread,\n     And dauntless Jack repaired to bed.\n\n     O'er the hero as he slumbers,\n     Spirits hymn aerial numbers;\n          In a chorus manifold,\n     Of the deeds and days of old;\n     Fairy dreams his rest beguile,\n     Till he feels Aurora's smile.\n\n\n     XXII.\n\n\n     \"Hallo!\" cries Jack, as he awakes,\n     Just as the early morning breaks,\n     And rubs his eyes,--\n           \"'Tis time to-rise.\"\n\n     And ready for mischief he gaily makes.\n\n\n     XXIII.\n\n\n     With the mist of the morning, a little bit\n     More transparent, I trow, than it,\n     He climbs the mountain's craggy side;\n     Anon the castle's lordly pride\n\n{051}\n\n\n     He braves with free and fearless brow,\n     And mutters, \"Now then for the row! \"\n\n     Before the gates on either side,\n     A \"formidable shape\" he spied;\n     A monstrous griffin right and left,\n     Like to an antediluvian eft;\n     Green of back and yellow of maw,\n     Forked of tongue, and crooked of claw;\n     Belching and snivelling flame and fire,--\n     A regular pair of chimeras dire.\n\n     \"Oh!\" said Jack, and he made a face,\n     \"I never saw such a scaly brace!\"\n\n     Unharmed he 'scaped, because unseen,\n     Those monsters all so fierce and green;\n     Through files of reptile guards he passed,\n     Scolopendras black and vast;\n     Many a hydra, many a lizard,\n     Heros' tomb its filthy gizzard;\n     Dragon with mouth like \u00c3\u0086tna's crater,\n     Crocodile and alligator;\n     Huge spiders and scorpions round him crawled,\n     Monstrous toads before him sprawled;\n     Great rattle-snakes their fangs displayed--\n     \"Hurrah!\" he shouted, \"who's afraid?\"\n\n     And now upon the inner gate\n     He reads these mystic words of fate:--\n\n                                         See Page Image==> {051}\n\n\n{052}\n\n\n     XXIV.\n\n\n      Above the distich hung the trump:-\n      The hero got it with a jump,\n      And shouting gallantly, \"Ya--hips!\"\n      Applied the mouth-piece to his lips.\n\n      A blast he blew,-\n      Asunder flew\n      The portals with a brazen clang:\n               Windows were smashed,\n      And chains were clashed,\n      While a thousand gongs in discord rang.\n\n      A voice within, that seemed the note\n      Of some prodigious magpie's throat,\n      In ranc'rous tone cried, \"Hallo, now!\n      I say, what means this tarnel row?\"\n      And out came Catawampus, cross;\n      Behind him slunk Slockdollagos;\n      The Great Sea Serpent, trailing slim\n      His coils tremendous, after him.\n\n\n     XXV.\n\n\n      Six of the tallest men that e'er\n      Raised in old Kentucky were,\n      Each standing on the other's head,\n      Had scarce o'ertopped the monster dread;\n      The brim of his hat, so considerate,\n      Was half as big round as the King's Round Table;\n      His massive club was a maple's trunk:-\n      He might have made great Arthur \"funk.\"\n\n\n{053}\n\n\n     Arthur the First, or Arthur the Second,\n     As Arthur oe Wellington may be reckoned.\n     Slockdollagos was rather less,\n     But he was n't very short, I guess:--\n     He was fashionably drest,\n     In the style of a Wizard of the West.\n\n\n     XXVI.\n\n\n     \"Clear off, now,\" was the Giant's cry;\n     \"The oldest man in all Kentucky\n     My father whopp'd--my father, I:--\n     Absquotilate, and cut your lucky!\"\n     Catawampus looked on every side,\n     But not a single soul espied;\n     To the right and left he grimly grinned,\n     Till the trunks of the very trees were skinned.\n\n     \"Come out!\" he bawled, \"or I swear I 'll dash\n     Your brains into an immortal smash!\n     Don't raise my dander; if you do,\n     You won't much like me,--_I_ tell you.\"\n\n\n     XXVII.\n\n\n     Jack laughed this bootless brag to hear,\n     And thus he sang in the Giant's ear:-\n     \"Yankee doodle doodle doo,\n        Yankee doodle dandy;\n     Prepare your knavish deeds to rue,\n     For know, your fate is handy!\"\n\n{054}\n\n\n     XXVIII.\n\n\n     Slockdollagos turned green and blue,\n     But Catawampus in fury flew,\n     And brandished at random his maple stick,\n     Smashing the nose of the wizard \"slick\n     Who fetched him in return a kick,\n     Crying, \"Hallo! I wish you'd mind;\n     I rather speculate you 're blind.\"\n\n\n     XXIX.\n\n\n     Catawampus bellowed \"Oh!\n     I say, tarnation sieze your toe!\"\n     Rubbing the part as he limped and hopped:\n     Jack his legs in sunder chopped.\n\n     He fell with an astounding sound,\n     And his castle tottered to the ground.\n     In faith, the most \"tremendous fall\n     In tea,\" to this, was nothing at all.\n\n     No wallop'd nigger, to compare\n         Small things, for the nonce, with great,\n     Ever so dismally the air\n         Rent with shrieks, I estimate.\n\n     The monstrous Yankee thus laid low,\n         Jack settled his hash with another blow;\n     So he gave up the ghost, and his dying groan\n     Had a \"touch of the earthquake\" in its tone.\n\n\n[Illustration: 088]\n\n\n     XXX.\n\n\n     Biting his nails, and shaking with fear,\n     The wizard vile was standing near;\n\n\n{055}\n\n\n     When he saw Catawampus fall and die,\n     He knew that the end of his course was nigh.\n     \"My flint,\" he cried, \"is fixed, I snore!\"\n     He rent his hair and his garments tore,\n     Blasphemed and cursed, and vowed and swore.\n\n     Jack felt half frightened and greatly shocked,\n     When, behold! the mountain rocked:\n\n     Sudden night overspread the sky;\n     Pale blue lightnings glimmered by;\n     Roared the thunder, yawned the earth;\n     And with yells of hideous mirth,\n     Mid serpents and skeletons ghastly and dire,\n     The spirits of evil came in fire;-\n     Beelzebub and Zatanai,\n     Asdramelech and Asmodai,\n     Zamiel and Ashtaroth, with legions\n     Of frightful shapes from Pluto's regions;\n     And, the sorceror shrieking with frantic dismay,\n     On the wings of a whilwind they bore him away.\n\n     When once again the daylight broke,\n     The castle had vanished away like smoke.\n\n\n     XXXI.\n\n\n     \"My eye!\" said Jack, a little serious;\n     \"Upon my word, that _was_ mysterious!\"\n\n     But cheers and joyous gratulations\n     Cut short the hero's meditations;\n\n     The \"deformed transformed\" round him press,\n     Knights and ladies numberless;\n\n            Who each, as Jack, you know, had heard,\n            The warlock had changed to beast and bird;\n            And who straight had recovered their pristine condition\n            When Old Nick flew away with the wicked magician.\n\n\n     XXXII.\n\n\n            Hurrah! Jack's labours now are done,\n            He hath slain the Giants all, save one;\n            I mean his great uncle; and he's bound o'er\n            To keep the peace for evermore.\n\n\n\n     XXXIII.\n\n\n               To ancient Yenta's city fair\n               Forthwith the champion makes resort;\n     For Arthur kept his castle there\n     (Still, in the _Nisi Prius_ Court,\n\n               The Table Round of his famous hall\n               Gaily flaunts upon the wall).\n\n               Through the King's gate he took his way\n               (He had come by sea to Hampton town,\n               Where he called, just \"How d' ye do?\" to say,\n               On Bevis, knight of high renown).\n\n     As he passed through the Close, all the friars, to see him,\n     Came out in canonicals, singing \"Te Deum;\"\n     As he rode up the High Street, the little boys followed,\n     And they flung up their caps, cheered, and shouted, and halloed.\n     The windows were crowded with ladies so bright,\n     All smiling and waving their kerchiefs of white.\n\n                  Jack with dignity bowed\n                  Right and left to the crowd,\n\n     Gracefully mingling the humble and proud.\n\n\n{057}\n\n\n     XXXIV.\n\n     He now before King Arthur's throne,\n     Knelt with obeisance grave;\n     A thousand bright eyes on him shone,\n     As they shine upon the brave.\n\n\n[Illustration: 092]\n\n\n{058}\n\n\n     \"Rise up,\" the noble Arthur said,\n     \"Sir Jack, a Baron bold;\"\n     And he placed upon the champion's head\n         A coronet of gold.\n\n     \"This Princess fair shall be thy bride,\n     Our cousin, by my fay;\n     And let the nuptial knot be tied\n         This morn without delay.\"\n\n\n     XXXV.\n\n\n     The holy wedding mass was sung,\n     And the cathedral's bells were rung;\n     A banquet was made in the royal hall,\n     And after that there was a ball.\n\n     There waltzed Sir Lancelot du Lac,\n     And eke Sir Tristram bold;\n     Likewise the stout Sir Caradoc,\n     \"That won the cup of gold.\"\n\n     But none among King Arthur's court,\n     For style, and grace, and air,\n     And noble mien, and knightly port,\n     Could with Sir Jack compare.\n\n\n     XXXVI.\n\n\n     Together with a beauteous mate\n     The King gave Jack a great estate:\n     In bliss the hero, with his wife,\n     Lived the remainder of his life.\n\n     \"In story shall he live for aye\n         Such is the say of Merlin, sage;\n     And by Saint George! fair England's stay,\n     His name, till time shall pass away,\n         Shall never fade from glory's page.\n     For all your march of intellect,\n     Your pumps so prim, and blues so clever,\n     The useful-knowledge-mongering sect,--\n     Jack, famous Jack, shall live for ever!\n\n[Illustration; 094]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Jack The Giant Killer, by Percival Leigh\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK JACK THE GIANT KILLER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 45021-8.txt or 45021-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/4\/5\/0\/2\/45021\/\n\nProduced by David Widger from images generously provided\nby The Internet Archive\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1446,"split":"test"}
