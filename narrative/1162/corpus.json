{"ori_id":"24c8ed4f493ab62acff4da9bad5c6a1c07e4770d","title":"The Maid of Sker","context":"The Maid of Sker\n The Maid of Sker is set at the end of the 18th century, and the story is told by Davy Llewellyn, an old fisherman. The story concerns a two-year-old girl who drifts in a boat onto a beach in Glamorganshire in the calm before a storm. The little girl calls herself Bardie. Llewellyn is tempted to keep the girl, but decides to give her up and keeps the boat for himself. He quarters the pretty child in a simple, but well-to-do, household in his neighbourhood. As she grows up he dotes upon her so far as he can. He watches anxiously over her fortunes, partly or principally because he thinks his own may be bound up with them. It is clear from the refinement of the girl's manners, and from the fineness of her clothes she was washed ashore in, that she is no common child.\nDavy joins the crew of a ketch trading between Barnstaple and Porthcawl. Whilst in Devon, he encounters several characters who hold the key to solving the mystery of the maid of Sker. These include Sir Philip Bampfylde who spends most of his time looking for his two grandchildren who have mysteriously disappeared; Parson Chowne, a parson of demoniac wickedness and craft who works his will for many years in the north of Devon, defying God, man, and the law; and Captain Drake Bamfylde who is under suspicion of having made away with the children of his elder brother, and heirs to the family property. Old Davy gradually unravels the mystery and sets matters right, although many distractions delay him including an extended period at sea in which Blackmore gives a graphic account of the Battle of the Nile.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's The Maid of Sker, by Richard Doddridge Blackmore\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Yet no peace there is for me among my friends\nand neighbours, unless I will set to and try--as they bid me twice a-day\nperhaps--whether I cannot tell the rights of a curious adventure which\nit pleased Providence should happen, off and on, amidst us, now for a\ngood many years, and with many ins and outs to it. They assure me, also,\nthat all good people who can read and write for ten, or it may be\ntwenty, miles around the place I live in, will buy my book--if I can\nmake it--at a higher price, perhaps, per lb., than they would give me\neven for sewin, which are the very best fish I catch: and hence\nprovision may be found for the old age and infirmities, now gaining upon\nme, every time I try to go out fishing.\n\nIn this encouragement and prospect I have little faith, knowing how much\nmore people care about what they eat than what they read. Nevertheless I\nwill hope for the best, especially as my evenings now are very long and\nwearisome; and I was counted a hopeful scholar, fifty years agone\nperhaps, in our village school here--not to mention the Royal Navy; and\nmost of all, because a very wealthy gentleman, whose name will appear in\nthis story, has promised to pay all expenses, and \u00c2\u00a350 down (if I do it\nwell), and to leave me the profit, if any.\n\nNotwithstanding this, the work of writing must be very dull to me,\nafter all the change of scene, and the open air and sea, and the many\nsprees ashore, and the noble fights with Frenchmen, and the power of\noaths that made me jump so in his Majesty's navy. God save the King, and\nQueen, and members of the Royal Family, be they as many as they\nwill--and they seem, in faith, to be manifold. But His power is equal to\nit all, if they will but try to meet Him.\n\nHowever, not to enter upon any view of politics--all of which are far\nbeyond the cleverest hand at a bait among us--I am inditing of a thing\nvery plain and simple, when you come to understand it; yet containing a\nlittle strangeness, and some wonder, here and there, and apt to move\ngood people's grief at the wrongs we do one another. Great part of it\nfell under mine own eyes, for a period of a score of years, or something\nthereabout. My memory still is pretty good; but if I contradict myself,\nor seem to sweep beyond my reach, or in any way to meddle with things\nwhich I had better have let alone, as a humble man and a Christian, I\npray you to lay the main fault thereof on the badness of the times, and\nthe rest upon human nature. For I have been a roving man, and may have\ngathered much of evil from contact with my fellow-men, although by\norigin meant for good. In this I take some blame to myself; for if I had\npolished my virtue well, the evil could not have stuck to it.\nNevertheless, I am, on the whole, pretty well satisfied with myself;\nhoping to be of such quality as the Lord prefers to those perfect\ncreatures with whom He has no trouble at all, and therefore no\nenjoyment.\n\nBut sometimes, taking up a book, I am pestered with a troop of doubts;\nnot only about my want of skill, and language, and experience, but\nchiefly because I never have been a man of consummate innocence,\nexcellence, and high wisdom, such as all these writers are, if we go by\ntheir own opinions.\n\nNow, when I plead among my neighbours, at the mouth of the old well, all\nthe above, my sad shortcomings, and my own strong sense of them (which\nperhaps is somewhat over-strong), they only pat me on the back, and\nsmile at one another, and make a sort of coughing noise, according to my\nbashfulness. And then if I look pleased (which for my life I cannot help\ndoing), they wink, as it were, at one another, and speak up like this:--\n\n\"Now, Davy, you know better. You think yourself at least as good as any\none of us, Davy, and likely far above us all. Therefore, Davy the\nfisherman, out with all you have to say, without any French palaver.\nYou have a way of telling things so that we can see them.\"\n\nWith this, and with that, and most of all with hinting about a\nFrenchman, they put me on my mettle, so that I sit upon the side-stones\nof the old-well gallery (which are something like the companion-rail of\na fore-and-after), and gather them around me, with the householders put\nforemost, according to their income, and the children listening between\ntheir legs; and thus I begin, but never end, the tale I now begin to\nyou, and perhaps shall never end it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nHUNGER DRIVES HIM A-FISHING.\n\n\nIn the summer of the year 1782, I, David Llewellyn, of Newton-Nottage,\nfisherman and old sailor, was in great distress and trouble, more than I\nlike to tell you. My dear wife (a faithful partner for eight-and-twenty\nyears, in spite of a very quick temper) was lately gone to a better\nworld; and I missed her tongue and her sharp look-out at almost every\ncorner. Also my son (as fine a seaman as ever went aloft), after helping\nLord Rodney to his great victory over Grass the Frenchman, had been lost\nin a prize-ship called the Tonner, of 54 guns and 500 Crappos, which\nsank with all hands on her way home to Spithead, under Admiral Graves.\nHis young wife (who had been sent to us to see to, with his blessing) no\nsooner heard of this sad affair as in the Gazette reported, and his pay\nthat week stopped on her, but she fell into untimely travail, and was\ndead ere morning. So I buried my wife and daughter-in-law, and lost all\nchance to bury my son, between two Bridgend market-days.\n\nNow this is not very much, of course, compared with the troubles some\npeople have. But I had not been used to this matter, except in case of a\nmessmate; and so I was greatly broken down, and found my eyes so weak of\na morning, that I would not be seen out of doors, almost.\n\nThe only one now to keep a stir or sound of life in my little cottage,\nwhich faces to the churchyard, was my orphan grandchild \"Bunny,\"\ndaughter of my son just drowned, and his only child that we knew of.\nBunny was a rare strong lass, five years old about then, I think; a\nstout and hearty-feeding child, able to chew every bit of her victuals,\nand mounting a fine rosy colour, and eyes as black as Archangel pitch.\n\nOne day, when I was moping there, all abroad about my bearings, and no\nbetter than water-ballasted, the while I looked at my wife's new broom,\nnow carrying cobweb try-sails, this little Bunny came up to me as if she\nhad a boarding-pike, and sprang into the netting hammocks of the best\nblack coat I wore.\n\n\"Grand-da!\" she said, and looked to know in what way I would look at\nher; \"Grand-da, I must have sumkin more to eat.\"\n\n\"Something more to eat!\" I cried, almost with some astonishment, well as\nI knew her appetite; for the child had eaten a barley-loaf, and two\npig's feet, and a dog-fish.\n\n\"Yes, more; more bexfass, grand-da.\" And though she had not the words to\ntell, she put her hands in a way that showed me she ought to have more\nsolid food. I could not help looking sadly at her, proud as I was of her\nappetite. But, recovering in a minute or two, I put a good face upon it.\n\n\"My dear, and you shall have more,\" I said; \"only take your feet out of\nmy pocket. Little heart have I for fishing, God knows; but a-fishing I\nwill go this day, if mother Jones will see to you.\"\n\nFor I could not leave her alone quite yet, although she was a brave\nlittle maid, and no fire now was burning. But within a child's trot from\nmy door, and down toward the sandhills, was that famous ancient well of\nwhich I spoke just now, dedicate to St John the Baptist, where they used\nto scourge themselves. The village church stood here, they say, before\nthe inroad of the sand; and the water was counted holy. How that may be,\nI do not know; but the well is very handy. It has a little grey round\ntower of stone domed over the heart of it, to which a covered way goes\ndown, with shallow steps irregular. If it were not for this plan, the\nsand would whelm the whole of it over; even as it has overwhelmed all\nthe departure of the spring, and the cottages once surrounding it. Down\nthese steps the children go, each with a little brown pitcher, holding\nhands and groping at the sides, as they begin to feel darker. And what\nwith the sand beneath their feet, and the narrowing of the roof above,\nand the shadows moving round them, and the doubt where the water begins\nor ends (which nobody knows at any time), it is much but what some\nlittle maid tumbles in, and the rest have to pull her out again.\n\nFor this well has puzzled all the country, and all the men of great\nlearning, being as full of contrariety as a maiden courted. It comes and\ngoes, in a manner, against the coming and going of the sea, which is\nonly half a mile from it; and twice in a day it is many feet deep, and\nagain not as many inches. And the water is so crystal-clear, that down\nin the dark it is like a dream. Some people say that John the Baptist\nhad nothing to do with the making of it, because it was made before his\ntime by the ancient family of De Sandford, who once owned all the manors\nhere. In this, however, I place no faith, having read my Bible to better\npurpose than to believe that John Baptist was the sort of man to claim\nanything, least of all any water, unless he came honestly by it.\n\nIn either case, it is very pretty to see the children round the entrance\non a summer afternoon, when they are sent for water. They are all a\nlittle afraid of it, partly because of its maker's name, and his having\nhis head on a charger, and partly on account of its curious ways, and\nthe sand coming out of its \"nostrils\" when first it begins to flow.\n\nThat day with which I begin my story, Mrs Jones was good enough to take\ncharge of little Bunny; and after getting ready to start, I set the\nthong of our latch inside, so that none but neighbours who knew the\ntrick could enter our little cottage (or rather \"mine\" I should say\nnow); and thus with conger-rod, and prawn-net, and a long pole for the\nbass, and a junk of pressed tobacco, and a lump of barley-bread, and a\nmaybird stuffed with onions (just to refine the fishiness), away I set\nfor a long-shore day, upon as dainty a summer morn as ever shone out of\nthe heavens.\n\n\"Fisherman Davy\" (as they call me all around our parts) was fifty and\ntwo years of age, I believe, that very same July, and with all my heart\nI wish that he were as young this very day. For I never have found such\ncall to enter into the affairs of another world, as to forget my\nbusiness here, or press upon Providence impatiently for a more heavenly\nstate of things. People may call me worldly-minded for cherishing such a\nview of this earth; and perhaps it is not right of me. However, I can\nput up with it, and be in no unkindly haste to say \"good-bye\" to my\nneighbours. For, to my mind, such a state of seeking, as many amongst us\ndo even boast of, is, unless in a bad cough or a perilous calenture, a\ncertain proof of curiosity displeasing to our Maker, and I might even\nsay of fickleness degrading to a true Briton.\n\nThe sun came down upon my head, so that I thought of bygone days, when I\nserved under Captain Howe, or Sir Edward Hawke, and used to stroll away\nupon leave, with half a hundred Jacks ashore, at Naples, or in Bermudas,\nor wherever the luck might happen. Now, however, was no time for me to\nthink of strolling, because I could no longer live at the expense of the\nGovernment, which is the highest luck of all, and full of noble dignity.\nThings were come to such a push that I must either work or starve; and\ncould I but recall the past, I would stroll less in the days gone by. A\npension of one and eightpence farthing for the weeks I was alive (being\nin right of a heavy wound in capture of the Bellona, Frenchman of\ntwo-and-thirty guns, by his Majesty's frigate Vesta, under Captain Hood)\nwas all I had to hold on by, in support of myself and Bunny, except the\nslippery fish that come and go as Providence orders them. She had sailed\nfrom Martinique, when luckily we fell in with her; and I never shall\nforget the fun, and the five hours at close quarters. We could see the\npowder on the other fellows' faces while they were training their guns\nat us, and we showed them, with a slap, our noses, which they never\ncontrived to hit. She carried heavier metal than ours, and had sixty\nmore men to work it, and therefore we were obliged at last to capture\nher by boarding. I, like a fool, was the first that leaped into her\nmizen-chains, without looking before me, as ought to have been. The\nFrenchmen came too fast upon me, and gave me more than I bargained for.\n\nThus it happened that I fell off, in the very prime of life and\nstrength, from an able-bodied seaman and captain of the foretop to a\nsort of lurcher along shore, and a man who must get his own living with\nnets and rods and suchlike. For that very beautiful fight took place in\nthe year 1759, before I was thirty years old, and before his present\nmost gracious Majesty came to the throne of England. And inasmuch as a\nvillanous Frenchman made at me with a cutlash, and a power of blue oaths\n(taking a nasty advantage of me, while I was yet entangled), and thumped\nin three of my ribs before a kind Providence enabled me to relieve him\nof his head at a blow--I was discharged, when we came to Spithead, with\nan excellent character in a silk bag, and a considerable tightness of\nbreathing, and leave to beg my way home again.\n\nNow I had not the smallest meaning to enter into any of these\nparticulars about myself, especially as my story must be all about other\npeople--beautiful maidens, and fine young men, and several of the prime\ngentry. But as I have written it, so let it stay; because, perhaps,\nafter all, it is well that people should have some little knowledge of\nthe man they have to deal with, and learn that his character and\nposition are a long way above all attempt at deceit.\n\nTo come back once again, if you please, to that very hot day of July\n1782--whence I mean to depart no more until I have fully done with\nit--both from the state of the moon, I knew, and from the neap when my\nwife went off, that the top of the spring was likely to be in the dusk\nof that same evening. At first I had thought of going down straight\nbelow us to Newton Bay, and peddling over the Black Rocks towards the\nOgmore river, some two miles to the east of us. But the bright sun gave\nme more enterprise; and remembering how the tide would ebb, also how low\nmy pocket was, I felt myself bound in honour to Bunny to make a real\npush for it, and thoroughly search the conger-holes and the\nlobster-ledges, which are the best on all our coast, round about Pool\nTavan, and down below the old house at Sker.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE FISH ARE AS HUNGRY AS HE IS.\n\n\nTo fish at Sker had always been a matter of some risk and conflict;\ninasmuch as Evan Thomas, who lived in the ancient house there, and kept\nthe rabbit-warren, never could be brought to know that the sea did not\nbelong to him. He had a grant from the manor, he said, and the shore was\npart of the manor; and whosoever came hankering there was a poacher, a\nthief, and a robber. With these hard words, and harder blows, he kept\noff most of the neighbourhood; but I always felt that the lurch of the\ntide was no more than the heeling of a ship, and therefore that any one\nfree of the sea, was free of the ebb and flow of it.\n\nSo when he began to reproach me once, I allowed him to swear himself\nthoroughly out, and then, in a steadfast manner, said, \"Black Evan, the\nshore is not mine or yours. Stand you here and keep it, and I will never\ncome again;\" for in three hours' time there would be a fathom of water\nwhere we stood. And when he caught me again, I answered, \"Evan Black, if\nyou catch me inland, meddling with any of your land-goods, coneys, or\nhares, or partridges, give me a leathering like a man, and I must put up\nwith it; but dare you touch me on this shore, which belongs to our lord\nthe King, all the way under high-water mark, and by the rod of the Red\nSea I will show you the law of it.\"\n\nHe looked at me and the pole I bore, and, heavy and strong man as he\nwas, he thought it wiser to speak me fair. \"Well, well, Dyo, dear,\" he\nsaid in Welsh, having scarce any English, \"you have served the King,\nDyo, and are bound to know what is right and wrong; only let me know,\ngood man, if you see any other rogues fishing here.\"\n\nThis I promised him freely enough, because, of course, I had no\nobjection to his forbidding other people, and especially one vile\nScotchman. Yet being a man of no liberality, he never could see even me\nfish there without following and abusing me, and most of all after a\nmarket-day.\n\nThat tide I had the rarest sport that ever you did see. Scarcely a\nconger-hole I tried without the landlord being at home, and biting\nsavagely at the iron, which came (like a rate) upon him; whereupon I had\nhim by the jaw, as the tax-collector has us. Scarcely a lobster-shelf I\nfelt, tickling as I do under the weeds, but what a grand old soldier\ncame to the portcullis of his stronghold, and nabbed the neat-hide up my\nfingers, and stuck thereto till I hauled him out \"nolus-woluss,\" as we\nsay; and there he showed his purple nippers, and his great long\nwhiskers, and then his sides, hooped like a cask, till his knuckled legs\nfought with the air, and the lobes of his tail were quivering. It was\nfine to see these fellows, worth at least a shilling, and to pop them\ninto my basket, where they clawed at one another. Glorious luck I had,\nin truth, and began to forget my troubles, and the long way home again\nto a lonely cottage, and my fear that little Bunny was passing a sorry\nday of it. She should have a new pair of boots, and mother Jones a good\nSunday dinner; and as for myself, I would think, perhaps, about half a\nglass of fine old rum (to remind me of the navy), and a pipe of the\nshort cut Bristol tobacco--but that must depend upon circumstances.\n\nNow circumstances had so much manners (contrary to their custom) that\nthey contrived to keep themselves continually in my favour. Not only did\nI fetch up and pile a noble heap of oysters and mussels just at the\nlowest of the ebb, but after that, when the tide was flowing, and my\nwork grew brisker--as it took me by the calves, and my feet were not cut\nby the mussels more than I could walk upon--suddenly I found a thing\nbeating all experience both of the past and future.\n\nThis was, that the heat of the weather, and the soft south wind\nprevailing, had filled the deep salt-water pools among the rocks of Pool\nTavan, and as far as Ffynnon wen, with the finest prawns ever seen or\ndreamed of; and also had peopled the shallow pools higher up the beach\nwith shoals of silver mullet-fry--small indeed, and as quick as\nlightning, but well worth a little trouble to catch, being as fine\neating as any lady in the land could long for.\n\nAnd here for a moment I stood in some doubt, whether first to be down on\nthe prawns or the mullet; but soon I remembered the tide would come\nfirst into the pools that held the prawns. Now it did not take me very\nlong to fill a great Holland bag with these noble fellows, rustling\ntheir whiskers, and rasping their long saws at one another. Four gallons\nI found, and a little over, when I came to measure them; and sixteen\nshillings I made of them, besides a good many which Bunny ate raw.\n\nNeither was my luck over yet, for being now in great heart and good\nfeather, what did I do but fall very briskly upon the grey mullet in the\npools: and fast as they scoured away down the shallows, fluting the\nsurface with lines of light, and huddling the ripples all up in a curve,\nas they swung themselves round on their tails with a sweep, when they\ncould swim no further--nevertheless it was all in vain, for I blocked\nthem in with a mole of kelp, weighted with heavy pebbles, and then baled\nthem out at my pleasure.\n\nNow the afternoon was wearing away, and the flood making strongly up\nchannel by the time I came back from Ffynnon wen--whither the mullet had\nled me--to my headquarters opposite Sker farmhouse, at the basin of Pool\nTavan. This pool is made by a ring of rocks sloping inward from the sea,\nand is dry altogether for two hours' ebb and two hours' flow of a good\nspring-tide, except so much as a little land-spring, sliding down the\nslippery sea-weed, may have power to keep it moist.\n\nA wonderful place here is for wild-fowl, the very choicest of all I\nknow, both when the sluice of the tide runs out and when it comes\nswelling back again; for as the water ebbs away with a sulky wash in the\nhollow places, and the sand runs down in little crannies, and the\nbladder-weeds hang trickling, and the limpets close their valves, and\nthe beautiful jelly-flowers look no better than chilblains,--all this\nvoid and glistening basin is at once alive with birds.\n\nFirst the seapie runs and chatters, and the turn-stone pries about with\nhis head laid sideways in a most sagacious manner, and the sanderlings\nglide in file, and the greenshanks separately. Then the shy curlews over\nthe point warily come, and leave one to watch; while the brave little\nmallard teal, with his green triangles glistening, stands on one foot in\nthe fresh-water runnel, and shakes with his quacks of enjoyment.\n\nAgain, at the freshening of the flood, when the round pool fills with\nsea (pouring in through the gate of rock), and the waves push merrily\nonward, then a mighty stir arises, and a different race of birds--those\nwhich love a swimming dinner--swoop upon Pool Tavan. Here is the giant\ngrey gull, breasting (like a cherub in church) before he dowses down his\nhead, and here the elegant kittywake, and the sullen cormorant in the\nshadow swimming; and the swiftest of swift wings, the silver-grey\nsea-swallow, dips like a butterfly and is gone; while from slumber out\nat sea, or on the pool of Kenfig, in a long wedge, cleaves the air the\nwhistling flight of wild-ducks.\n\nStanding upright for a moment, with their red toes on the water, and\ntheir strong wings flapping, in they souse with one accord and a\nstrenuous delight. Then ensues a mighty quacking of unanimous content, a\ncourteous nodding of quick heads, and a sluicing and a shovelling of\nwater over shoulder-blades, in all the glorious revelry of insatiable\nwashing.\n\nRecovering thence, they dress themselves in a sober-minded manner,\npaddling very quietly, proudly puffing out their breasts, arching their\nnecks, and preening themselves, titivating (as we call it) with their\nbills in and out the down, and shoulders up to run the wet off; then\nturning their heads, as if on a swivel, they fettle their backs and\ntheir scapular plume. Then, being as clean as clean can be, they begin\nto think of their dinners, and with stretched necks down they dive to\ncatch some luscious morsel, and all you can see is a little sharp tail\nand a pair of red feet kicking.\n\nBless all their innocent souls, how often I longed to have a good shot\nat them, and might have killed eight or ten at a time with a long gun\nheavily loaded! But all these birds knew, as well as I did, that I had\nno gun with me; and although they kept at a tidy distance, yet they let\nme look at them, which I did with great peace of mind all the time I was\neating my supper. The day had been too busy till now to stop for any\nfeeding; but now there would be twenty minutes or so ere the bass came\ninto Pool Tavan, for these like a depth of water.\n\nSo after consuming my bread and maybird, and having a good drink from\nthe spring, I happened to look at my great flag-basket, now ready to\nburst with congers and lobsters and mullet, and spider-crabs for Bunny\n(who could manage any quantity), also with other good saleable fish; and\nI could not help saying to myself, \"Come, after all now, Davy Llewellyn,\nyou are not gone so far as to want a low Scotchman to show you the place\nwhere the fish live.\" And with that I lit a pipe.\n\nWhat with the hard work, and the heat, and the gentle plash of wavelets,\nand the calmness of the sunset, and the power of red onions, what did I\ndo but fall asleep as snugly as if I had been on watch in one of his\nMajesty's ships of the line after a heavy gale of wind? And when I woke\nup again, behold, the shadows of the rocks were over me, and the sea was\nsaluting the calves of my legs, which up to that mark were naked; and\nbut for my instinct in putting my basket up on a rock behind me, all my\nnoble catch of fish must have gone to the locker of Davy Jones.\n\nAt this my conscience smote me hard, as if I were getting old too soon;\nand with one or two of the short strong words which I had learned in the\nnavy, where the chaplain himself stirred us up with them, up I roused\nand rigged my pole for a good bout at the bass. At the butt of the ash\nwas a bar of square oak, figged in with a screw-bolt, and roven round\nthis was my line of good hemp, twisted evenly, so that if any fish came\nwho could master me, and pull me off the rocks almost, I could indulge\nhim with some slack by unreeving a fathom of line. At the end of the\npole was a strong loop-knot, through which ran the line, bearing two\nlarge hooks, with the eyes of their shanks lashed tightly with cobbler's\nends upon whipcord. The points of the hooks were fetched up with a file,\nand the barbs well backened, and the whole dressed over with whale-oil.\nThen upon one hook I fixed a soft crab, and on the other a cuttle-fish.\nThere were lug-worms also in my pot, but they would do better after\ndark, when a tumbling cod might be on the feed.\n\nGood-luck and bad-luck has been my lot ever since I can remember;\nsometimes a long spell of one, wing and wing, as you might say, and then\na long leg of the other. But never in all my born days did I have such a\nspell of luck in the fishing way as on that blessed 10th of July 1782.\n\nWhat to do with it all now became a puzzle, for I could not carry it\nhome all at once; and as to leaving a bit behind, or refusing to catch a\nsingle fish that wanted to be caught, neither of these was a possible\nthing to a true-born fisherman.\n\nAt last things came to such a pitch that it was difficult not to believe\nthat all must be the crowd and motion of a very pleasant dream. Here was\nthe magic ring of the pool, shaped by a dance of sea-fairies, and the\nfading light shed doubtfully upon the haze of the quivering sea, and the\nsilver water lifting like a mirror on a hinge, while the black rocks\nseemed to nod to it; and here was I pulling out big fishes almost faster\nthan I cast in.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nHE LANDS AN UNEXPECTED FISH.\n\n\nNow, as the rising sea came sliding over the coronet of rocks, as well\nas through the main entrance--for even the brim of the pool is covered\nat high water--I beheld a glorious sight, stored in my remembrance of\nthe southern regions, but not often seen at home. The day had been very\nhot and brilliant, with a light air from the south; and at sunset a haze\narose, and hung as if it were an awning over the tranquil sea. First, a\ngauze of golden colour, as the western light came through, and then a\ntissue shot with red, and now a veil of silvery softness, as the summer\nmoon grew bright.\n\nThen the quiet waves began--as their plaited lines rolled onward into\nfrills of whiteness--in the very curl and fall, to glisten with a\nflitting light. Presently, as each puny breaker overshone the one in\nfront, not the crest and comb alone, but the slope behind it, and the\ncrossing flaws inshore, gleamed with hovering radiance and soft flashes\nvanishing; till, in the deepening of the dusk, each advancing crest was\nsparkling with a mane of fire, every breaking wavelet glittered like a\nshaken seam of gold. Thence the shower of beads and lustres lapsed into\na sliding tier, moving up the sands with light, or among the pebbles\nbreaking into a cataract of gems.\n\nBeing an ancient salt, of course I was not dismayed by this show of\nphosphorus, nor even much astonished, but rather pleased to watch the\nbrightness, as it brought back to my mind thoughts of beautiful sunburnt\ndamsels whom I had led along the shore of the lovely Mediterranean. Yet\nour stupid landsmen, far and wide, were panic-struck; and hundreds fell\nupon their knees, expecting the last trump to sound. All I said to\nmyself was this: \"No wonder I had such sport to-day; change of weather\nsoon, I doubt, and perhaps a thunderstorm.\"\n\nAs I gazed at all this beauty, trying not to go astray with wonder and\nwith weariness, there, in the gateway of black rock, with the offing\ndark behind her, and the glittering waves upon their golden shoulders\nbearing her--sudden as an apparition came a smoothly-gliding boat.\nBeaded all athwart the bows and down the bends with drops of light,\nholding stem well up in air, and the forefoot shedding gold, she came as\nstrait toward this poor and unconverted Davy as if an angel held the\ntiller, with an admiral in the stern-sheets.\n\nHereupon such terror seized me, after the wonders of the day, that my\npole fell downright into the water (of which a big fish wronged me so as\nto slip the hook and be off again), and it was no more than the turn of\na hair but what I had run away head over heels. For the day had been so\nmiraculous, beginning with starvation, and going on with so much heat\nand hard work and enjoyment, and such a draught of fishes, that a poor\nbody's wits were gone with it; and therefore I doubt not it must have\nbeen an especial decree of Providence that in turning round to run away\nI saw my big fish-basket.\n\nTo carry this over the rocks at a run was entirely impossible (although\nI was still pretty good in my legs), but to run away without it was a\ngreat deal more impossible for a man who had caught the fish himself;\nand beside the fish in the basket, there must have been more than two\nhundredweight of bass that would not go into it. Three hundred and a\nhalf in all was what I set it down at, taking no heed of prawns and\nlobsters; and with any luck in selling, it must turn two guineas.\n\nHence, perhaps, it came to pass (as much as from downright bravery, of\nwhich sometimes I have some little) that I felt myself bound to creep\nback again, under the shade of a cold wet rock, just to know what that\nboat was up to.\n\nA finer floatage I never saw, and her lines were purely elegant, and\nshe rode above the water without so much as parting it. Then, in spite\nof all my fear, I could not help admiring; and it struck me hotly at the\nheart, \"Oh, if she is but a real boat, what a craft for my business!\"\nAnd with that I dropped all fear. For I had not been able, for many\nyears, to carry on my fishing as skill and knowledge warranted, only\nbecause I could not afford to buy a genuine boat of my own, and hitherto\nhad never won the chance without the money.\n\nAs yet I could see no soul on board. No one was rowing, that was\ncertain, neither any sign of a sail to give her steerage-way. However,\nshe kept her course so true that surely there must be some hand\ninvisible at the tiller. This conclusion flurried me again, very\nundesirably; and I set my right foot in such a manner as to be off in a\ntwinkling of anything unholy.\n\nBut God has care of the little souls which nobody else takes heed of;\nand so He ordained that the boat should heel, and then yaw across the\nmiddle of the pool; but for which black rocks alone would have been her\nwelcome.\n\nAt once my heart came back to me; for I saw at once, as an old sailor\npretty well up in shipwrecks, that the boat was no more than a derelict;\nand feeling that here was my chance of chances, worth perhaps ten times\nmy catch of fish, I set myself in earnest to the catching of that boat.\n\nTherefore I took up my pole again, and finding that the brace of fish\nwhom I had been over-scared to land had got away during my slackness, I\nspread the hooks, and cast them both, with the slugs of lead upon them,\nand half a fathom of spare line ready, as far as ever my arms would\nthrow.\n\nThe flight of the hooks was beyond my sight, for the phosphorus spread\nconfusion; but I heard most clearly the thump, thump of the two leaden\nbobs--the heavy and the light one--upon hollow planking. Upon this I\nstruck as I would at a fish, and the hooks got hold (or at any rate one\nof them), and I felt the light boat following faster as she began to get\nway on the haul; and so I drew her gently toward me, being still in some\nmisgiving, although resolved to go through with it.\n\nBut, bless my heart, when the light boat glided buoyantly up to my very\nfeet, and the moon shone over the starboard gunwale, and without much\ndrawback I gazed at it--behold! the little craft was laden with a\nfreight of pure innocence! All for captain, crew, and cargo, was a\nlittle helpless child. In the stern-sheets, fast asleep, with the baby\nface towards me, lay a little child in white. Something told me that it\nwas not dead, or even ailing; only adrift upon the world, and not at\nall aware of it. Quite an atom of a thing, taking God's will anyhow;\ncast, no doubt, according to the rocking of the boat, only with one tiny\narm put up to keep the sun away, before it fell asleep.\n\nBeing taken quite aback with pity, sorrow, and some anger (which must\nhave been of instinct), I laid hold of the bows of the skiff, and drew\nher up a narrow channel, where the land-spring found its way. The lift\nof a round wave helped her on, and the bladder-weed saved any chafing. A\nbrand-new painter (by the feel) it was that I caught hold of; but\ninstead of a hitch at the end, it had a clean sharp cut across it.\nHaving made it fast with my fishing-pole jammed hard into a crevice of\nrock, I stepped on board rather gingerly, and, seating myself on the\nforward thwart, gazed from a respectful distance at the little stranger.\n\nThe light of the moon was clear and strong, and the phosphorus of the\nsea less dazing as the night grew deeper, therefore I could see pretty\nwell; and I took a fresh plug of tobacco before any further meddling.\nFor the child was fast asleep; and, according to my experience, they are\nalways best in that way.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nA LITTLE ORPHAN MERMAID.\n\n\nBy the clear moonlight I saw a very wee maiden, all in white, having\nneither cloak nor shawl, nor any other soft appliance to protect or\ncomfort her, but lying with her little back upon the aftmost planking,\nwith one arm bent (as I said before), and the other drooping at her\nside, as if the baby-hand had been at work to ease her crying; and then,\nwhen tears were tired out, had dropped in sleep or numb despair.\n\nMy feelings were so moved by this, as I became quite sure at last that\nhere was a little mortal, that the tears came to mine own eyes too, she\nlooked so purely pitiful. \"The Lord in heaven have mercy on the little\ndear!\" I cried, without another thought about it; and then I went and\nsat close by, so that she lay between my feet.\n\nHowever, she would not awake, in spite of my whistling gradually, and\nsinging a little song to her, and playing with her curls of hair;\ntherefore, as nothing can last for ever, and the tide was rising fast, I\nwas forced to give the little lady, not what you would call a kick so\nmuch as a very gentle movement of the muscles of the foot.\n\nShe opened her eyes at this, and yawned, but was much inclined to shut\nthem again; till I (having to get home that night) could make no further\nallowance for her, as having no home to go to; and upon this I got over\nall misgivings about the dirtiness of my jacket, and did what I had\nfeared to do, by reason of great respect for her; that is to say, I put\nboth hands very carefully under her, and lifted her like a delicate\nfish, and set her crosswise on my lap, and felt as if I understood her;\nand she could not have weighed more than twenty pounds, according to my\nheft of fish.\n\nHaving been touched with trouble lately, I was drawn out of all\nexperience now (for my nature is not over-soft) towards this little\nthing, so cast, in a dream almost, upon me. I thought of her mother,\nwell drowned, no doubt, and the father who must have petted her, and of\nthe many times to come when none would care to comfort her. And though a\nchild is but a child, somehow I took to that child. Therefore I became\nmost anxious as to her state of body, and handled her little mites of\nfeet, and her fingers, and all her outworks; because I was not sure at\nall that the manner of her yawning might be nothing more or less than a\ngoing out of this world almost. For think, if you can see it so, how\neverything was against her. To be adrift without any food, or any one to\ntend her, many hours, or days perhaps, with a red-hot sun or cold stars\noverhead, and the greedy sea beneath her!\n\nHowever, there she was alive, and warm, and limp, to the best of my\njudgment, sad though I was to confess to myself that I knew more of bass\nthan of babies. For it had always so pleased God that I happened to be\naway at sea when He thought fit to send them; therefore my legs went\nabroad with fear of dandling this one, that now was come, in a way to\ndisgrace a seaman; for if she should happen to get into irons, I never\ncould get her out again.\n\nUpon that matter, at any rate, I need not have concerned myself, for the\nchild was so trim and well ballasted, also ribbed so stiff and sound,\nthat any tack I set her on she would stick to it, and start no rope; and\nknowing that this was not altogether the manner of usual babies (who yaw\nabout, and no steerage-way), I felt encouraged, and capable almost of a\nwoman's business. Therefore I gave her a little tickle; and verily she\nbegan to laugh, or perhaps I should say by rights to smile, in a gentle\nand superior way--for she always was superior. And a funnier creature\nnever lived, neither one that could cry so distressfully.\n\n\"Wake up, wake up, my deary,\" said I, \"and don't you be afraid of me. A\nfine little girl I've got at home, about twice the size that you be, and\ngoes by the name of 'Bunny.'\"\n\n\"Bunny!\" she said; and I was surprised, not being up to her qualities,\nthat she could speak so clearly. Then it struck me that if she could\ntalk like that I might as well know more about her. So I began, very\ncraftily, with the thing all children are proud about, and are generally\nsure to be up to.\n\n\"Pretty little soul,\" I said, \"how old do you call yourself?\"\n\nAt this she gathered up her forehead, not being used to the way I put\nit, while she was trying to think it out.\n\n\"How old are you, deary?\" said I, trying hard to suck up my lips and\nchirp, as I had seen the nurses do.\n\n\"I'se two, I'se two,\" she answered, looking with some astonishment;\n\"didn't 'a know that? Hot's 'a name?\"\n\nThis proof of her high standing and knowledge of the world took me for\nthe moment a good deal off my legs, until I remembered seeing it put as\na thing all must give in to, that the rising generation was beyond our\nunderstanding. So I answered, very humbly, \"Deary, my name is 'old\nDavy.' Baby, kiss old Davy.\"\n\n\"I 'ill,\" she answered, briskly. \"Old Davy, I likes 'a. I'll be a good\ngal, I 'ill.\"\n\n\"A good girl! To be sure you will. Bless my heart, I never saw such a\ngirl.\" And I kissed her three or four times over, until she began to\nsmell my plug, and Bunny was nobody in my eyes. \"But what's your own\nname, deary, now you know old Davy's name?\"\n\n\"I'se Bardie. Didn't 'a know that?\"\n\n\"To be sure I did,\" for a little fib was needful from the way she looked\nat me, and the biggest one ever told would have been a charity under the\ncircumstances.\n\n\"Pease, old Davy, I'se aye hungy,\" she went on ere I was right again,\n\"and I 'ants a dink o' yater.\"\n\n\"What a fool I am!\" cried I. \"Of course you do, you darling. What an\natomy you are to talk! Stop here a moment.\"\n\nSetting her on the seat by herself (like a stupid, as I was, for she\nmight have tumbled overboard), I jumped out of the boat to fetch her\nwater from the spring-head, as well as the relics of my food from the\ncorner of the fish-basket. And truly vexed was I with myself for\ndevouring of my dinner so. But no sooner was I gone, than feeling so\nleft alone again after so much desertion, what did the little thing do\nbut spring like a perfect grasshopper, and, slipping under the\nafter-thwart, set off in the bravest toddle for the very bow of the\nboat, in fear of losing sight of me? Unluckily, the boat just happened\nto lift upon a bit of a wave, and, not having won her sea-legs yet in\nspite of that long cruise, down came poor Bardie with a thump, which\nhurt me more than her, I think.\n\nKnowing what Bunny would have done, I expected a fearful roar, and back\nI ran to lift her up. But even before I could interfere, she was up\nagain and all alive, with both her arms stretched out to show, and her\nface set hard to defy herself.\n\n\"I 'ont ky, I 'ont, I tell 'a. 'Ee see if I does now, and ma say hot a\ngood gal I is.\"\n\n\"Where did you knock yourself, little wonder? Let old Davy make it well.\nShow old Davy the poor sore place.\"\n\n\"Nare it is. Gardy l\u00c3\u00a0! nare poor Bardie knock herself.\"\n\nAnd she held up her short white smock, and showed me the bend of her\ndelicate round knee as simply and kindly as could be.\n\n\"I 'ont ky; no, I 'ont,\" she went on, with her pretty lips screwed up.\n\"Little brother ky, 'e know; but Bardie a gate big gal, savvy voo?\nBardie too big enough to ky.\"\n\nHowever, all this greatness vanished when a drop of blood came oozing\nfrom the long black bruise, and still more when I tried to express my\ndeep compassion. The sense of bad-luck was too strong for the courage of\neven two years' growth, and little Bardie proved herself of just the\nright age for crying. I had observed how clear and bright and musical\nher voice was for such a tiny creature; and now the sound of her great\nwoe, and scene of her poor helpless plight, was enough to move the rocks\ninto a sense of pity for her.\n\nHowever, while she had her cry out (as the tide would never wait), I\ntook the liberty of stowing all my fish and fishing-tackle on board of\nthat handy little boat, which I began to admire and long for more and\nmore every time I jumped from the rock into her foresheets. And finding\nhow tight and crank she was, and full of spring at every step and with a\npair of good ash sculls, and, most of all, discovering the snuggest of\nsnug lockers, my conscience (always a foremost feature) showed me in the\nstrongest light that it would be a deeply ungracious, ungrateful, and\neven sinful thing, if I failed to thank an ever wise and overruling\nProvidence for sending me this useful gift in so express a manner.\n\nAnd taking this pious and humble view of the night's occurrence, I soon\nperceived a special fitness in the time of its ordering. For it happened\nto be the very night when Evan Thomas was out of the way, as I had been\ntold at Nottage, and the steward of the manor safe to be as drunk as a\nfiddler at Bridgend; and it was not more than a few months since that\nenvious Scotchman, Sandy Macraw (a scurvy limb of the coastguards, who\nlived by poaching on my born rights), had set himself up with a boat,\nforsooth, on purpose to rogue me and rob me the better. No doubt he had\nstolen it somewhere, for he first appeared at night with it; and now\nhere was a boat, in all honesty mine, which would travel two feet for\neach one of his tub!\n\nBy the time I had finished these grateful reflections, and resolved to\ncontribute any unsold crabs to the Dissenting minister's salary (in\nrecognition of the hand of Providence, and what he had taught me\nconcerning it no longer ago than last Sabbath-day, when he said that the\nLord would make up to me for the loss of my poor wife, though never\ndreaming, I must confess, of anything half so good as a boat), and by\nthe time that I had moored this special mercy snugly, and hidden the\noars, so that no vile wrecker could make off with her feloniously, that\ndear little child was grown quiet again, being unable to cry any more,\nand now beginning to watch my doings as much as I could wish, or more.\n\nShe never seemed tired of watching me, having slept out all her sleep\nfor the moment; and as I piled up fish on fish, and they came sliding,\nslippery, she came shyly, eyeing them with a desire to see each one,\npushing her mites of fingers out, and then drawing back in a hurry as\ntheir bellies shone in the moonlight. Some of the congers could wriggle\nstill, and they made her scream when they did it; but the lobsters were\nher chief delight, being all alive and kicking. She came and touched\nthem reverently, and ready to run if they took it amiss; and then she\nstroked their whiskers, crying, \"Pitty, pitty! jolly, jolly!\" till one\ngreat fellow, who knew no better, would have nipped her wrist asunder if\nI had not ricked his claw.\n\n\"Now, deary,\" said I, as I drew her away, \"you have brought poor old\nDavy a beautiful boat, and the least that he can do for you is to get\nyou a good supper.\" For since her tumble the little soul had seemed\nneither hungry nor thirsty.\n\n\"Pease, old Davy,\" she answered, \"I 'ants to go to mama and papa, and\nickle bother and Susan.\"\n\n\"The devil you do!\" thought I, in a whistle, not seeing my way to a fib\nas yet.\n\n\"Does 'ee know mama and papa, and ickle bother, old Davy?\"\n\n\"To be sure I do, my deary--better than I know you, almost.\"\n\n\"'Et me go to them, 'et me go to them. Hot ma say about my poor leggy\npeggy?\"\n\nThis was more than I could tell; believing her mother to be, no doubt,\nsome thirty fathoms under water, and her father and little brother in\nabout the same predicament.\n\n\"Come along, my little dear, and I'll take you to your mother.\" This was\nwhat I said, not being ready, as yet, with a corker.\n\n\"I'se yeady, old Davy,\" she answered; \"I'se kite yeady. 'Hen 'll 'e be\nyeady? Peshy voo.\"\n\n\"Ready and steady: word of command! march!\" said I, looking up at the\nmoon, to try to help me out of it. But the only thing that I could find\nto help me in this trouble was to push about and stir, and keep her\nlooking at me. She was never tired of looking at things with life or\nmotion in them; and this I found the special business of her nature\nafterwards.\n\nNow, being sure of my boat, I began to think what to do with Bardie. And\nmany foolish ideas came, but I saw no way to a wise one, or at least I\nthought so then, and unhappily looked to prudence more than to gracious\nProvidence, for which I have often grieved bitterly, ever since it\nturned out who Bardie was.\n\nFor the present, however (though strongly smitten with her manners,\nappearance, and state of shipwreck, as well as impressed with a general\nsense of her being meant for good-luck to me), I could not see my way to\ntake her to my home and support her. Many and many times over I said to\nmyself, in my doubt and uneasiness, and perhaps more times than need\nhave been if my conscience had joined me, that it was no good to be a\nfool, to give way (as a woman might do) to the sudden affair of the\nmoment, and a hot-hearted mode of regarding it. And the harder I worked\nat the stowing of fish, the clearer my duty appeared to me.\n\nSo by the time that all was ready for starting with this boat of mine,\nthe sea being all the while as pretty as a pond by candle-light, it was\nsettled in my mind what to do with Bardie. She must go to the old\nSker-house. And having taken a special liking (through the goodness of\nmy nature and the late distress upon me) to this little helpless thing,\nmost sincerely I prayed to God that all might be ordered for the best;\nas indeed it always is, if we leave it to Him.\n\nNevertheless I ought never to have left it to Him, as every one now\nacknowledges. But how could I tell?\n\nBy this time she began to be overcome with circumstances, as might\nhappen naturally to a child but two years old, after long exposure\nwithout any food or management. Scared, and strange, and tired out, she\nfell down anyhow in the boat, and lay like a log, and frightened me.\nMany men would have cared no more, but, taking the baby for dead, have\ndropped her into the grave of the waters. I, however, have always been\nof a very different stamp from these; and all the wars, and discipline,\nand doctrine I have encountered, never could imbue me with the cruelty\nof my betters. Therefore I was shocked at thinking that the little dear\nwas dead.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nFINDS A HOME OF SOME SORT.\n\n\nHowever, it was high time now, if we had any hope at all of getting into\nSker-house that night, to be up and moving. For though Evan Thomas might\nbe late, Moxy, his wife, would be early; and the door would open to none\nbut the master after the boys were gone to bed. For the house is very\nlonely; and people no longer innocent as they used to be in that\nneighbourhood.\n\nI found the child quite warm and nice, though overwhelmed with weight of\nsleep; and setting her crosswise on my shoulders, whence she slid down\ninto my bosom, over the rocks I picked my way, by the light of the full\nclear moon, towards the old Sker-Grange, which stands a little back\nfrom the ridge of beach, and on the edge of the sandhills.\n\nThis always was, and always must be, a very sad and lonesome place,\nclose to a desolate waste of sand, and the continual roaring of the sea\nupon black rocks. A great grey house, with many chimneys, many gables,\nand many windows, yet not a neighbour to look out on, not a tree to feed\nits chimneys, scarce a firelight in its gables in the very depth of\nwinter. Of course, it is said to be haunted; and though I believe not\naltogether in any stories of that kind--despite some very strange things\nindeed which I have beheld at sea--at any rate, I would rather not hear\nany yarns on that matter just before bedtime in that house; and most\npeople would agree with me, unless I am much mistaken.\n\nFor the whole neighbourhood--if so you may call it, where there are no\nneighbours--is a very queer one--stormy, wild, and desolate, with little\nmore than rocks and sand and sea to make one's choice among. As to the\nsea, not only dull, and void it is of any haven, or of proper traffic,\nbut as dangerous as need be, even in good weather, being full of\ndraughts and currents, with a tide like a mill-race, suffering also the\nups and downs which must be where the Atlantic Ocean jostles with blind\nnarrowings: it offers, moreover, a special peril (a treacherous and a\nshifty one) in the shape of some horrible quicksands, known as the\n\"Sker-Weathers:\" these at the will of storm and current change about\nfrom place to place, but are, for the most part, some two miles from\nshore, and from two to four miles long, according to circumstances;\nsometimes almost bare at half-tide, and sometimes covered at low water.\nIf any ship falls into them, the bravest skipper that ever stood upon a\nquarter-deck can do no more than pipe to prayers, though one or two\ncraft have escaped when the tide was rising rapidly.\n\nAs for the shore, it is no better (when once you get beyond the rocks)\nthan a stretch of sandhills, with a breadth of flaggy marsh behind them\nall the way to the mouth of Neath river, some three leagues to the\nwestward. Eastward, the scene is fairer inland, but the coast itself\nmore rugged and steep, and scarcely more inhabited, having no house\nnearer than Rhwychyns, which is only a small farm, nearly two miles from\nSker-Grange, and a mile from any other house. And if you strike inland\nfrom Sker--that is to say, to the northward--there is nothing to see but\nsand, warren, and furze, and great fields marked with rubble, even as\nfar as Kenfig.\n\nLooking at that vast lonely house, there were two things I never could\nmake out. The first was, who could ever have been mad enough to build it\nthere?--for it must have cost a mint of money, being all of quarried and\ncarried stone, and with no rich farm to require it. And the second thing\nwas still worse a puzzle: how could any one ever live there?\n\nAs to the first point, the story is, that the house was built by abbots\nof Neath, when owners of Sker-manor, adding to it, very likely, as they\nfollowed one another; and then it was used as their manor-court, and for\npurposes more important, as a place of refection, being near good\nfisheries, and especially Kenfig Pool, stocked with all fresh-water\nfish, and every kind of wild-fowl.\n\nBut upon the other question all that I can say is this: I have knocked\nabout the world a good bit, and have suffered many trials, by the which\nI am, no doubt, chastened and highly rectified; nevertheless, I would\nrather end my life among the tomb-stones, if only allowed three\nfarthings' worth of tobacco every day, than live with all those abbots'\nluxuries in that old grey house.\n\nHowever, there were no abbots now, nor any sort of luxury, only a rough\nunpleasant farmer, a kind but slovenly wife of his, and five great lads,\nnotorious for pleasing no one except themselves; also a boy of a\ndifferent order, as you soon shall see.\n\nThinking of all this, I looked with tenderness at the little dear,\nfallen back so fast asleep, innocent, and trustful, with her head upon\nmy shoulder, and her breathing in my beard. Turning away at view of the\nhouse, I brought the moonlight on her face, and this appeared so pure,\nand calm, and fit for better company, that a pain went to my heart, as\nin Welsh we speak of it.\n\nBecause she was so fast asleep, and that alone is something holy in a\nvery little child; so much it seems to be the shadow of the death\nitself, in their pausing fluttering lives, in their want of wit for\ndreaming, and their fitness for a world of which they must know more\nthan this; also to a man who feels the loss of much believing, and what\ngrievous gain it is to make doubt of everything, such a simple trust in\nHim, than whom we find no better father, such a confidence of safety at\nthe very outset seems a happy art unknown, and tempts him back to\nignorance. Well aware what years must bring, from all the ill they have\nbrought to us, we cannot watch this simple sort without a sadness on our\nside, a pity, and a longing, as for something lost and gone.\n\nIn the scoop between two sandhills such a power of moonlight fell upon\nthe face of this baby, that it only wanted the accident of her lifting\nbright eyes to me to make me cast away all prudence, and even the dread\nof Bunny. But a man at my time of life must really look to the main\nchance first, and scout all romantic visions; and another face means\nanother mouth, however pretty it may be. Moreover, I had no wife now,\nnor woman to look after us; and what can even a man-child do, without\ntheir apparatus? While on the other hand I knew that (however dreary\nSker might be) there was one motherly heart inside it. Therefore it came\nto pass that soon the shadow of that dark house fell upon the little one\nin my arms, while with a rotten piece of timber, which was lying handy,\nI thumped and thumped at the old oak door, but nobody came to answer me;\nnobody even seemed to hear, though every knock went further and further\ninto the emptiness of the place.\n\nBut just as I had made up my mind to lift the latch, and to walk in\nfreely, as I would have done in most other houses, but stood upon\nscruple with Evan Thomas, I heard a slow step in the distance, and Moxy\nThomas appeared at last--a kindly-hearted and pleasant woman, but apt to\nbe low-spirited (as was natural for Evan's wife), and not very much of a\nmanager. And yet it seems hard to blame her there, when I come to think\nof it, for most of the women are but so, round about our\nneighbourhood--sanding up of room and passage, and forming patterns on\nthe floor every other Saturday, and yet the roof all frayed with\ncobwebs, and the corners such as, in the navy, we should have been\nrope-ended for.\n\nBy means of nature, Moxy was shaped for a thoroughly good and lively\nwoman; and such no doubt she would have been, if she had had the luck to\nmarry me, as at one time was our signification. God, however, ordered\nthings in a different manner, and no doubt He was considering what might\nbe most for my benefit. Nevertheless, in the ancient days, when I was a\nfine young tar on leave, and all Sunday-school set caps at me (perhaps I\nwas two-and-twenty then), the only girl I would allow to sit on the\ncrossing of my legs, upon a well-dusted tombstone, and suck the things I\ncarried for them (all being fond of peppermint), was this little Moxy\nStradling, of good Newton family, and twelve years old at that time. She\nmade me swear on the blade of my knife never to have any one but her;\nand really I looked forward to it as almost beyond a joke; and her\nfather had some money.\n\n\"Who's there at this time of night?\" cried Moxy Thomas, sharply, and in\nWelsh of course, although she had some English; \"pull the latch, if you\nbe honest. Evan Black is in the house.\"\n\nBy the tone of her voice I knew that this last was a fib of fright, and\nglad I was to know it so. Much the better chance was left me of\ndisposing Bardie somewhere, where she might be comfortable.\n\nSoon as Mrs Thomas saw us by the light of a home-made dip, she scarcely\nstopped to stare before she wanted the child out of my arms, and was\nready to devour it, guessing that it came from sea, and talking all the\nwhile, full gallop, as women find the way to do. I was expecting fifty\nquestions, and, no doubt, she asked them, yet seemed to answer them all\nherself, and be vexed with me for talking, yet to want me to go on.\n\n\"Moxy, now be quick,\" I said; \"this little thing from out the sea----\"\n\n\"Quick is it? Quick indeed! Much quick you are, old Dyo!\" she replied in\nEnglish. \"The darling dear, the pretty love!\" for the child had spread\nits hands to her, being taken with a woman's dress. \"Give her to me,\nclumsy Davy. Is it that way you do carry her?\"\n\n\"Old Davy tarry me aye nicely, I tell 'a. Old Davy good and kind; and I\n'ont have him called kumsy.\"\n\nSo spake up my two-year-old, astonishing me (as she always has done) by\nher wonderful cleverness, and surprising Moxy Thomas that such clear\ngood words should come from so small a creature.\n\n\"My goodness me! you little vixen! wherever did you come from? Bring her\nin yourself, then, Dyo, if she thinks so much of you. Let me feel her.\nNot wet she is. Where-ever did you get her? Put her on this little\nstool, and let her warm them mites of feet till I go for bread and\nbutter.\"\n\nAlthough the weather was so hot, a fire of coal and driftwood was\nburning in the great chimney-place, for cooking of black Evan's supper;\nbecause he was an outrageous man to eat, whenever he was drunk, which\n(as a doctor told me once) shows the finest of all constitutions.\n\nBut truly there was nothing else of life, or cheer, or comfort, in the\ngreat sad stony room. A floor of stone, six gloomy doorways, and a\nblack-beamed ceiling--no wonder that my little darling cowered back into\nmy arms, and put both hands before her eyes.\n\n\"No, no, no!\" she said. \"Bardie doesn't 'ike it. When mama come, she be\nvery angy with 'a, old Davy.\"\n\nI felt myself bound to do exactly as Mrs Thomas ordered me, and so I\ncarried Miss Finical to the three-legged stool of firwood which had been\npointed out to me; and having a crick in my back for a moment after\nbearing her so far, down I set her upon her own legs, which, although so\nneat and pretty, were uncommonly steadfast. To my astonishment, off she\nstarted (before I could fetch myself to think) over the rough stone\nflags of the hall, trotting on her toes entirely, for the very life of\nher. Before I could guess what she was up to, she had pounced upon an\nold kitchen-towel, newly washed, but full of splinters, hanging on a\nthree-legged horse, and back she ran in triumph with it--for none could\nsay that she toddled--and with a want of breath, and yet a vigour that\nmade up for it, began to rub with all her power, as well as a highly\nskilful turn, the top of that blessed three-legged stool, and some way\ndown the sides of it.\n\n\"What's the matter, my dear?\" I asked, almost losing my mind at this,\nafter all her other wonders.\n\n\"Dirt,\" she replied; \"degustin' dirt!\" never stopping to look up at me.\n\n\"What odds for a little dirt, when a little soul is hungry?\"\n\n\"Bardie a boofley kean gal, and this 'tool degustin' cochong!\" was all\nthe reply she vouchsafed me; but I saw that she thought less of me.\nHowever, I was glad enough that Moxy did not hear her, for Mrs Thomas\nhad no unreasonable ill-will towards dirt, but rather liked it in its\nplace; and with her its place was everywhere. But I, being used to see\nevery cranny searched and scoured with holy-stone, blest, moreover, when\nashore, with a wife like Amphitrite (who used to come aboard of us),\ncould thoroughly enter into the cleanliness of this Bardie, and thought\nmore of her accordingly.\n\nWhile this little trot was working, in the purest ignorance of father\nand of mother, yet perhaps in her tiny mind hoping to have pleased them\nboth, back came Mrs Thomas, bringing all the best she had of comfort and\nof cheer for us, although not much to speak of.\n\nI took a little hollands hot, on purpose to oblige her, because she had\nno rum; and the little baby had some milk and rabbit-gravy, being set up\nin a blanket, and made the most we could make of her. And she ate a\ntruly beautiful supper, sitting gravely on the stool, and putting both\nhands to her mouth in fear of losing anything. All the boys were gone\nto bed after a long day's rabbiting, and Evan Black still on the spree;\nso that I was very pleasant (knowing my boat to be quite safe) toward my\nancient sweetheart. And we got upon the old times so much, in a\npleasing, innocent, teasing way, that but for fear of that vile black\nEvan we might have forgotten poor Bardie.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nBOAT _VERSUS_ BARDIE.\n\n\nGlad as I was, for the poor child's sake, that Black Evan happened to be\nfrom home, I had perhaps some reason also to rejoice on my own account.\nFor if anything of any kind could ever be foretold about that most\nuncertain fellow's conduct, it was that when in his cups he would\nfight--with cause, if he could find any; otherwise, without it.\n\nAnd in the present case, perhaps, was some little cause for fighting;\ntouching (as he no doubt would think) not only his marital but manorial\nrights of plunder. Of course, between Moxy and myself all was purely\nharmless, each being thankful to have no more than a pleasant eye for\nthe other; and of course, in really serious ways, I had done no harm to\nhim; that boat never being his, except by downright piracy. Nevertheless\nfew men there are who look at things from what I may call a large and\nopen standing-place; and Evan might even go so far as to think that I\ndid him a double wrong, in taking that which was his, the boat, and\nleaving that which should have been mine--to wit, the little maiden--as\na helpless burden upon his hands, without so much as a change of\nclothes; and all this after a great day's sport among his rocks, without\nhis permission!\n\nFeeling how hopeless it would be to reason these matters out with him,\nespecially as he was sure to be drunk, I was glad enough to say\n\"Good-night\" to my new young pet, now fast asleep, and to slip off\nquietly to sea with my little frigate and its freight, indulging also my\nnatural pride at being, for the first time in my life, a legitimate\nshipowner and independent deep-sea fisherman. By this time the tide was\nturned, of course, and running strong against me as I laid her head for\nNewton Bay by the light of the full moon; and proud I was, without\nmistake, to find how fast I could send my little crank barky against the\ncurrent, having being a fine oarsman in my day, and always stroke of the\ncaptain's gig.\n\nBut as one who was well acquainted with the great dearth of honesty (not\nin our own parish only, but for many miles around), I could not see my\nway to the public ownership of this boat, without a deal of trouble and\nvexation. Happening so that I did not buy it, being thoroughly void of\nmoney (which was too notorious, especially after two funerals conducted\nto everybody's satisfaction), big rogues would declare at once, judging\nme by themselves, perhaps, that I had been and stolen it. And likely\nenough, to the back of this, they would lay me half-a-dozen murders and\na wholesale piracy.\n\nNow I have by nature the very strongest affection for truth that can be\nreconciled with a good man's love of reason. But sometimes it happens so\nthat we must do violence to ourselves for the sake of our\nfellow-creatures. If these, upon occasion offered, are only too sure to\nturn away and reject the truth with a strong disgust, surely it is dead\nagainst the high and pure duty we owe them, to saddle them with such a\nheavy and deep responsibility. And to take still loftier views of the\ncharity and kindness needful towards our fellow-beings--when they hanker\nfor a thing, as they do nearly always for a lie, and have set their\nhearts upon it, how selfish it must be, and inhuman, not to let them\nhave it! Otherwise, like a female in a delicate condition, to what\nextent of injury may we not expose them? Now sailors have a way of\ntelling great facts of imagination in the most straightforward and\nsimple manner, being so convinced themselves that they care not a rope's\nend who besides is convinced, and who is not. And to make other people\nbelieve, the way is not to want them to do it; only the man must himself\nbelieve, and be above all reasoning.\n\nAnd I was beginning to believe more and more as I went on, and the\nimportance of it grew clearer, all about that ill-fated ship of which I\nhad been thinking ever since the boat came in. Twelve years ago, as\nnearly as need be, and in the height of summer--namely, on the 3d of\nJune 1770--a large ship called the 'Planter's Welvard,' bound from\nSurinam to the Port of Amsterdam, had been lost and swallowed up near\nthis very dangerous place. Three poor children of the planter (whose\nname was J. S. Jackert), on their way home to be educated, had floated\nashore, or at least their bodies, and are now in Newton churchyard. The\nsame must have been the fate of Bardie but for the accident of that\nboat. And though she was not a Dutchman's child, so far as one could\nguess, from her wonderful power of English, and no sign of Dutch build\nabout her, she might very well have been in a Dutch ship with her father\nand mother, and little brother and Susan, in the best cabin. It was well\nknown among us that Dutch vessels lay generally northward of their true\ncourse, and from the likeness of the soundings often came up the Bristol\ninstead of the English Channel; and that this mistake (which the set of\nthe stream would increase) generally proved fatal to them in the absence\nof any lighthouse.\n\nThat some ship or other had been lost, was to my mind out of all\ndispute, although the weather had been so lovely; but why it must have\nbeen a Dutch rather than an English ship, and why I need so very plainly\nhave seen the whole of it myself (as by this time I began to believe\nthat I had done), is almost more than I can tell, except that I hoped it\nmight be so, as giving me more thorough warrant in the possession of my\nprize. This boat, moreover, seemed to be of foreign build, so far as I\ncould judge of it by moonlight: but of that hereafter.\n\nThe wonder is that I could judge of anything at all, I think, after the\nlong and hard day's work, for a man not so young as he used to be. And\nrocks are most confusing things to be among for a length of time, and\naway from one's fellow-creatures, and nothing substantial on the\nstomach. They do so darken and jag and quiver, and hang over heavily as\na man wanders under them, with never a man to speak to; and then the\nsands have such a way of shaking, and of shivering, and changing colour\nbeneath the foot, and shining in and out with patterns coming all astray\nto you! When to these contrary vagaries you begin to add the loose\nunprincipled curve of waves, and the up and down of light around you,\nand to and fro of sea-breezes, and startling noise of sea-fowl, and a\nworld of other confusions, with roar of the deep confounding them--it\nbecomes a bitter point to judge a man of what he saw, and what he thinks\nhe must have seen.\n\nIt is beneath me to go on with what might seem excuses. Enough that I\nfelt myself in the right; and what more can any man do, if you please,\nhowever perfect he may be? Therefore I stowed away my boat (well earned\nboth by mind and body) snugly enough to defy, for the present, even the\nsharp eyes of Sandy Macraw, under Newton Point, where no one ever went\nbut myself. Some of my fish I put to freshen in a solid mass of\nbladder-weed, and some I took home for the morning, and a stroke of\nbusiness after church. And if any man in the world deserved a downright\npiece of good rest that night, with weary limbs and soft conscience, you\nwill own it was Davy Llewellyn.\n\nSunday morning I lay abed, with Bunny tugging very hard to get me up for\nbreakfast, until it was almost eight o'clock, and my grandchild in a\nbitter strait of hunger for the things she smelled. After satisfying\nher, and scoring at the \"Jolly Sailors\" three fine bass against my shot,\nwhat did I do but go to church with all my topmost togs on? And that not\nfrom respect alone for the parson, who was a customer, nor even that\nColonel Lougher of Candleston Court might see me, and feel inclined to\ndischarge me as an exemplary Churchman (when next brought up before\nhim). These things weighed with me a little, it is useless to deny; but\nmy main desire was that the parish should see me there, and know that I\nwas not abroad on a long-shore expedition, but was ready to hold up my\nhead on a Sunday with the best of them, as I always had done.\n\nAt one time, while I ate my breakfast, I had some idea perhaps that it\nwould be more pious almost, and create a stronger belief in me, as well\nas ease my own penitence with more relief of groaning, if I were to\nappear in the chapel of the Primitive Christians, after certain fish\nwere gutted. But partly the fear of their singing noise (unsuitable to\nmy head that morning after the Hollands at Sker-house), and partly my\nsense that after all it was but forecastle work there, while the church\nwas quarter-deck, and most of all the circumstance that no magistrate\never went there, led me, on the whole, to give the preference to the old\nconcern, supported so bravely by royalty. Accordingly to church I went,\nand did a tidy stroke of business, both before and after service, in the\nway of lobsters.\n\nWe made a beautiful dinner that day, Bunny and I, and mother Jones, who\nwas good enough to join us; and after slipping down to see how my boat\nlay for the tide, and finding her as right as could be, it came into my\nhead that haply it would be a nice attention, as well as ease my mind\nupon some things that were running in it, if only I could pluck up\nspirit to defy the heat of the day, and challenge my own weariness by\nwalking over to Sker-Manor. For of course the whole of Monday, and\nperhaps of Tuesday too, and even some part of Wednesday (with people not\ntoo particular), must be occupied in selling my great catch of Saturday:\nso I resolved to go and see how the little visitor was getting on, and\nto talk with her. For though, in her weariness and wandering of the\nnight before, she did not seem to remember much, as was natural at her\ntender age, who could tell what might have come to her memory by this\ntime, especially as she was so clever? And it might be a somewhat\nawkward thing if the adventures which I felt really must have befallen\nher should happen to be contradicted by her own remembrance: for all I\nwanted was the truth; and if her truths contradicted mine, why, mine\nmust be squared off to meet them; for great is truth, and shall prevail.\n\nI thought it as well to take Bunny with me, for children have a\nremarkable knack of talking to one another, which they will not use to\ngrown people; also the walk across the sands is an excellent thing for\nyoung legs, we say, being apt to crack the skin a little, and so\nenabling them to grow. A strong and hearty child was Bunny, fit to be\nrated A.B., almost, as behoved a fine sailor's daughter. And as proud as\nyou could wish to see, and never willing to give in; so I promised\nmyself some little sport in watching our Bunny's weariness, as the sand\ngrew deeper, and yet her pride to the last declaring that I should not\ncarry her.\n\nBut here I reckoned quite amiss, for the power of the heat was\nsuch--being the very hottest day I ever knew out of the tropics, and the\ngreat ridge of sandhills shutting us off from any sight of the\nwater--that my little grandchild scarcely plodded a mile ere I had to\ncarry her. And this was such a heavy job among the deep dry mounds of\nsand, that for a time I repented much of the over-caution which had\nstopped me from using my beautiful new boat at once, to paddle down with\nthe ebb to Sker, and come home gently afterwards with the flow of the\ntide towards evening. Nevertheless, as matters proved, it was wiser to\nrisk the broiling.\n\nThis heat was not of the sun alone (such as we get any summer's day, and\nsuch as we had yesterday), but thickened heat from the clouds\nthemselves, shedding it down like a burning-glass, and weltering all\nover us. It was, though I scarcely knew it then, the summing-up and\ncrowning period of whole weeks of heat and drought, and indeed of the\nhottest summer known for at least a generation. And in the hollows of\nyellow sand, without a breath of air to stir, or a drop of moisture, or\na firm place for the foot, but a red and fiery haze to go through, it\nwas all a man could do to keep himself from staggering.\n\nHence it was close upon three o'clock, by the place the sun was in, when\nBunny and I came in sight of Sker-house, and hoped to find some water\nthere. Beer, of course, I would rather have; but never was there a\nchance of that within reach of Evan Thomas. And I tried to think this\nall the better; for half a gallon would not have gone any distance with\nme, after ploughing so long through sand, with the heavy weight of\nBunny, upon a day like that. Only I hoped that my dear little grandchild\nmight find something fit for her, and such as to set her up again; for\nnever before had I seen her, high and strong as her spirit was, so\novercome by the power and pressure of the air above us. She lay in my\narms almost as helpless as little Bardie, three years younger, had lain\nthe night before; and knowing how children will go off without a man's\nexpecting it, I was very uneasy, though aware of her constitution. So in\nthe heat I chirped and whistled, though ready to drop myself almost; and\ncoming in sight of the house, I tried my best to set her up again,\nfinding half of her clothes gone down her back, and a great part of her\nfat legs somehow sinking into her Sunday shoes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nCHILDREN WILL BE CHILDREN.\n\n\nThe \"boys of Sker,\" as we always called those rough fellows over at\nNewton, were rabbiting in the warren; according to their usual practice,\non a Sunday afternoon. A loose unseemly lot of lads, from fifteen up to\ntwo-and-twenty years of age, perhaps, and very little to choose between\nthem as to work and character. All, however, were known to be first-rate\nhands at any kind of sporting, or of poaching, or of any roving\npleasure.\n\nWatkin, the sixth and youngest boy, was of a different nature. His\nbrothers always cast him off, and treated him with a high contempt, yet\nnever could despise him. In their rough way, they could hardly help a\nsulky sort of love for him.\n\nThe seventh and last child had been a girl--a sweet little creature as\ncould be seen, and taking after Watkin. But she had something on her\nthroat from six months up to six years old; and when she died, some\nthree months back, people who had been in the house said that her mother\nwould sooner have lost all the boys put together, if you left Watkin out\nof them. How that was I cannot say, and prefer to avoid those subjects.\nBut I know that poor black Evan swore no oath worth speaking of for one\ngreat market and two small ones, but seemed brought down to sit by\nhimself, drinking quietly all day long.\n\nWhen we came to the ancient hall (or kitchen, as now they called it),\nfor a moment I was vexed--expecting more of a rush, perhaps, than I was\nentitled to. Knowing how much that young child owed me for her\npreservation, and feeling how fond I was of her, what did I look for but\nwild delight at seeing \"old Davy\" back again? However, it seems, she had\ntaken up with another and forgotten me.\n\nWatkin, the youngest boy of Sker, was an innocent good little fellow,\nabout twelve years old at that time. Bardie had found this out already;\nas quickly as she found out my goodness, even by the moonlight. She had\ntaken the lead upon Watkin, and was laying down the law to him, upon a\nquestion of deep importance, about the manner of dancing. I could dance\na hornpipe with anybody, and forward I came to listen.\n\n\"No, no, no! I tell 'a. 'E mustn't do like that, Yatkin. 'E must go\nyound and yound like this; and 'e must hold 'a cothes out, same as I\ndoes. Gardy l\u00c3\u00a0! 'E must hold 'a cothes out all the time, 'e must.\"\n\nThe little atom, all the time she delivered these injunctions, was\nholding out her tiny frock in the daintiest manner, and tripping\nsideways here and there, and turning round quite upon tiptoe, with her\nchildish figure poised, and her chin thrown forward; and then she would\ngive a good hard jump, but all to the tune of the brass jew's-harp which\nthe boy was playing for his very life. And all the while she was doing\nthis, the amount of energy and expression in her face was wonderful. You\nwould have thought there was nothing else in all the world that required\ndoing with such zeal and abandonment. Presently the boy stopped for a\nmoment, and she came and took the knee of his trousers, and put it to\nher pretty lips with the most ardent gratitude.\n\n\"She must be a foreigner,\" said I to myself: \"no British child could\ndance like that, and talk so; and no British child ever shows\ngratitude.\"\n\nAs they had not espied us yet, where we stood in the passage-corner, I\ndrew Bunny backward, and found her all of a tremble with eagerness to go\nand help.\n\n\"More pay,\" said little missy, with a coaxing look; \"more pay, Yatkin!\"\n\n\"No, no. You must say 'more play, please, Watkin.'\"\n\n\"See voo pay, Yatkin; I 'ants--more pay!\" The funny thing laughed at\nherself while saying it, as if with some comic inner sense of her own\ninsatiability in the matter of play.\n\n\"But how do you expect me to play the music,\" asked Watkin, very\nreasonably, \"if I am to hold my clothes out all the time?\"\n\n\"Can't 'a?\" she replied, looking up at him with the deepest\ndisappointment; \"can't 'a pay and dance too, Yatkin? I thought 'a could\ndo anything. I 'ants to go to my dear mama and papa and ickle bother.\"\n\nHere she began to set up a very lamentable cry, and Watkin in vain tried\nto comfort her, till, hearing us, she broke from him.\n\n\"Nare's my dear mama, nare's my dear mama coming!\" she exclaimed, as she\ntrotted full speed to the door. \"Mama! mama! here I is. And 'e mustn't\nscold poor Susan.\"\n\nIt is out of my power to describe how her little flushed countenance\nfell when she saw only me and Bunny. She drew back suddenly, with the\nbrightness fading out of her eager eyes, and the tears that were in them\nbegan to roll, and her bits of hands went up to her forehead, as if she\nhad lost herself, and the corners of her mouth came down; and then with\na sob she turned away, and with quivering shoulders hid herself. I\nscarcely knew what to do for the best; but our Bunny was very good to\nher, even better than could have been hoped, although she came of a\nkindly race. Without standing upon ceremony, as many children would have\ndone, up she ran to the motherless stranger, and, kneeling down on the\nfloor, contrived to make her turn and look at her. Then Bunny pulled out\nher new handkerchief, of which she was proud, I can tell you, being the\nfirst she had ever owned, made from the soundest corner of mother\nJones's old window-blind, and only allowed with a Sunday frock; and\nalthough she had too much respect for this to wet it with anything\nherself, she never for a moment grudged to wipe poor Bardie's eyes with\nit. Nay, she even permitted her--which was much more for a child to\ndo--to take it into her own two hands and rub away at her eyes with it.\n\nGradually she coaxed her out of the cupboard of her refuge, and sitting\nin some posture known to none but women children, without a stool to\nhelp her, she got the little one on her lap, and stroked at her, and\nmurmured to her, as if she had found a favourite doll in the depth of\ntrouble. Upon the whole, I was so pleased that I vowed to myself I would\ngive my Bunny the very brightest halfpenny I should earn upon the\nmorrow.\n\nMeanwhile, the baby of higher birth--as a glance was enough to show\nher--began to relax and come down a little, both from her dignity and\nher woe. She looked at Bunny with a gleam of humour, to which her wet\neyes gave effect.\n\n\"'E call that a ponkey-hankerchy? Does 'a call that a ponkey-hankerchy?\"\n\nBunny was so overpowered by this, after all that she had done, and at\nthe air of pity wherewith her proud ornament was flung on the floor,\nthat she could only look at me as if I had cheated her about it. And\ntruly I had seen no need to tell her about mother Jones and her blind.\nThen these little ones got up, having sense of a natural discordance of\nrank between them, and Bunny no longer wiped the eyes of Bardie, nor\nBardie wept in the arms of Bunny. They put their little hands behind\nthem, and stood apart to think a bit, and watched each other shyly. To\nsee them move their mouths and fingers, and peep from the corners of\ntheir eyes, was as good as almost any play without a hornpipe in it. It\nmade no difference, however. Very soon they came to settle it between\nthem. The low-born Bunny looked down upon Bardie for being so much\nsmaller, and the high-born Bardie looked down upon Bunny for being so\nmuch coarser. But neither was able to tell the other at all what her\nopinion was; and so, without any further trouble, they became very\nexcellent playmates.\n\nDoing my best to make them friends, I seized the little stranger, and\ngave her several good tosses-up, as well as tickles between them; and\nthis was more than she could resist, being, as her nature shows,\nthoroughly fond of any kind of pleasure and amusement. She laughed, and\nshe flung out her arms, and every time she made such jumps as to go up\nlike a feather. Pretty soon I saw, however, that this had gone on too\nlong for Bunny. She put her poor handkerchief out of sight, and then\nsome fingers into her mouth, and she looked as black as a dog in a\nkennel. But Bardie showed good-nature now, for she ran up to Bunny and\ntook her hand and led her to me, and said very nicely, \"Give this ickle\ngal some, old Davy. She haven't had no pay at all. Oh, hot boofley\nbuckens oo's got! Jolly, jolly! Keel song grand!\"\n\nThis admiration of my buttons--which truly were very handsome, being on\nmy regulation-coat, and as good as gilt almost, with \"Minotaur\" (a kind\nof grampus, as they say) done round them--this appreciation of the navy\nmade me more and more perceive what a dear child was come ashore to us,\nand that we ought to look alive to make something out of her. If she had\nany friends remaining (and they could scarcely have all been drowned),\nbeing, as she clearly was, of a high and therefore rich family, it might\nbe worth ten times as much as even my boat had been to me, to keep her\nsafe and restore her in a fat state when demanded. With that I made up\nmy mind to take her home with me that very night, especially as Bunny\nseemed to have set up a wonderful fancy to her. But man sees single, God\nsees double, as our saying is, and her bits of French made me afraid\nthat she might after all be a beggar.\n\n\"Now go and play, like two little dears, and remember whose day it is,\"\nI said to them both, for I felt the duty of keeping my grandchild up to\nthe mark on all religious questions; \"and be sure you don't go near the\nwell, nor out of sight of the house at all, nor pull the tails of the\nchickens out, nor throw stones at the piggy-wiggy,\" for I knew what\nBunny's tricks were. \"And now, Watty, my boy, come and talk to me, and\nperhaps I will give you a juneating apple from my own tree under the\nClevice.\"\n\nAlthough the heat was tremendous now (even inside those three-feet\nwalls), the little things did as I bade them. And I made the most of\nthis occasion to have a talk with Watkin, who told me everything he\nknew. His mother had not been down since dinner, which they always got\nanyhow; because his father, who had been poorly for some days, and\nfeverish, and forced to lie in bed a little, came to the top of the\nstairs, and called, requiring some attendance. What this meant I knew as\nwell as if I had seen black Evan there, parched with thirst and with\ngreat eyes rolling after helpless drunkenness, and roaring, with his\nnight-clothes on, for a quart of fresh-drawn ale.\n\nBut about the shipwrecked child Watty knew scarce anything. He had found\nher in his bed that morning--Moxy, no doubt, having been hard pushed\n(with her husband in that state) what to do. And knowing how kind young\nWatty was, she had quartered the baby upon him. But Watkin, though\ngifted with pretty good English (or \"Sassenach,\" as we call it) beyond\nall the rest of his family, could not follow the little creature in her\nmanner of talking; which indeed, as I found thereafter, nobody in the\nparish could do except myself, and an Englishwoman whose word was not\nworth taking.\n\n\"Indeed and indeed then, Mr Llewellyn,\" he went on in English, having an\nevident desire to improve himself by discourse with me, \"I did try, and\nI did try; and my mother, she try too. Times and times, for sure we\ntried. But no use was the whole of it. She only shakes her head, and\nthinks with all her might, as you may say. And then she says 'No! I'se\nnot hot you says. I'se two years old, and I'se Bardie. And my papa he be\nvery angy if 'e goes on so with me. My mama yoves me, and I yove her,\nand papa, and ickle bother, and everybody. But not the naughty bad man,\nI doesn't.' That isn't true English now, I don't think; is it then, Mr\nLlewellyn?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" I answered, seeing that my character for good English\nwas at stake.\n\n\"And mother say she know well enough the baby must be a foreigner. On\nher dress it is to show it. No name, as the Christians put, but marks\nwithout any meaning. And of clothes so few upon her till mother go to\nthe old cupboard. Rich people mother do say they must be; but dead by\nthis time, she make no doubt.\"\n\n\"Boy,\" I replied, \"your mother, I fear, is right in that particular. To\nme it is a subject of anxiety and sorrow. And I know perhaps more about\nit than any one else can pretend to do.\"\n\nThe boy looked at me with wonder and eagerness about it. But I gave him\na look, as much as to say, \"Ask no more at present.\" However, he was so\nfull of her that he could not keep from talking.\n\n\"We asked who the naughty bad man was, but she was afraid at that, and\nwent all round the room with her eyes, and hid under mother's apron. And\ndreadful she cried at breakfast about her mama and her own spoon. To my\nheart I feel the pain when she does cry; I know I do. And then of a\nsudden she is laughing, and no reason for it! I never did see such a\nbaby before. Do you think so, Mr Llewellyn?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nSANDHILLS TURNED TO SAND-HOLES.\n\n\nWhile I was talking thus with the boy, and expecting his mother every\nminute (with hope of a little refreshment when the farmer should have\ndropped off into his usual Sunday sleep), a very strange thing began\nmore and more to force itself on my attention. I have said that the hall\nof this desolate house was large and long, and had six doorways--narrow\narches of heavy stone without a door to any of them. Three of these\narches were at the west and three at the east end of the room, and on\nthe south were two old windows, each in a separate gable, high up from\nthe floor, and dark with stone-work and with lead-work; and in the\ncalmest weather these would draw the air and make a rattle. At the north\nside of the hall was nothing but dead wall, and fireplace, and\ncupboards, and the broad oak staircase. Having used the freedom to light\na pipe, I sate with my face to the chimney-corner, where some wood-ashes\nwere smouldering, after the dinner was done with; and sitting thus, I\nbecame aware of a presence of some sort over my right shoulder. At first\nI thought it was nothing more than the smoke from my own pipe, for I\npuffed rather hard, in anxiety about that little darling. But seeing\nsurprise, and alarm perhaps, in Watkin's face, who sate opposite, I\nturned round, and there beheld three distinct and several pillars of a\nbrownish-yellow light standing over against the doorways of the western\nend.\n\nAt first I was a little scared, and the more so because the rest of the\nhall was darkening with a pulse of colour gradually vanishing; and for\nan instant I really thought that the ghosts of the wrecked child's\nfather and mother, and perhaps her nurse, were come to declare the truth\nabout her, and challenge me for my hesitation. But presently I called to\nmind how many strange things had befallen me, both at sea and on the\ncoast, in the way of feeling and vision too, designed, however, by the\nPower that sends them, more to forewarn than frighten us, and, as we get\nused to them, to amuse or edify.\n\nTherefore I plucked my spirit up and approached this odd appearance, and\nfound that no part of it was visible upon the spot where it seemed to\nstand. But Watkin, who was much emboldened by my dauntless carriage,\ncalled out in Welsh that he could see me walking in and out of them,\nlike so many haystacks. Upon this I took yet further courage, having a\nwitness so close at hand, and nothing seeming to hurt me. So what did I\ndo but go outside, without any motion of running away, but to face the\nthing to its utmost; and Watkin, keeping along the wall, took good care\nto come after me.\n\nHere I discovered in half a second that I had been wise as well as\nstrong in meeting the matter valiantly; for what we had seen was but the\nglancing--or reflection, as they call it now--of what was being done\noutside. In a word, the thick and stifling heat of the day (which had\ngathered to a head the glaring and blazing power of the last two months\nof hot summer) was just beginning to burst abroad in whirlwind, hail,\nand thunder. All the upper heaven was covered with a spread of burning\nyellow; all the half-way sky was red as blood with fibres under it, and\nall the sides and margin looked as black as the new-tarred bends of a\nship. But what threw me most astray was, that the whole was whirling,\ntossing upward jets of darkness, as a juggler flings his balls, yet at\none time spinning round, and at the same time scowling down.\n\n\"It is a hurricane,\" said I, having seen some in the West Indies which\nbegan like this. Watkin knew not much of my meaning, but caught hold of\nmy coat, and stood. And in truth it was enough to make not only a slip\nof a boy, but a veteran sailor, stand and fear.\n\nNot a flash of lightning yet broke the expectation of it, nor had been a\ndrop of rain. But to my surprise, and showing how little we know of\nanything, over the high land broke a sand-storm, such as they have in\nAfrica. It had been brewing some time, most likely in the Kenfig\nburrows, toward the westward and the windward, although no wind was\nastir with us. I thought of a dance of waterspouts, such as we had twice\nencountered in the royal navy; once, I know, was after clearing the\nmouth of the Strait of Malaccas; where the other was I truly forget,\nhaving had so much to go everywhere. But this time the whirling stuff\nwas neither water, nor smoke, nor cloud; but sand, as plain as could be.\nIt was just like the parson's hour-glass--only going up, not coming\ndown, and quickly instead of slowly. And of these funnels, spinning\naround, and coming near and nearer, there may have been perhaps a dozen,\nor there may have been threescore. They differed very much in size,\naccording to the breadth of whirlwind, and the stuff it fed upon, and\nthe hole in the air it bored; but all alike had a tawny colour, and a\nmanner of bulking upward, and a loose uncertain edge, often lashing off\nin frays; and between them black clouds galloped; and sometimes two fell\ninto one, and bodily broke downward; then a pile (as big as Newton Rock)\nrose in a moment anyhow. Hill or valley made no odds; sandhill, or\nsand-bottom; the sand was in the place of the air, and the air itself\nwas sand.\n\nMany people have asked me, over and over again (because such a thing was\nscarcely known, except at the great storm of sand four hundred years\nago, they say)--our people, ever so many times, assert their privilege\nto ask me (now again especially) how many of these pillars there were! I\nwish to tell the truth exactly, having no interest in the matter--and if\nI had, no other matter would it be to me; and after going into my memory\ndeeper than ever I could have expected there would be occasion for, all\nI can say is this--legion was their number; because they were all coming\ndown upon me; and how could I stop to count them?\n\nWatkin lost his mind a little, and asked me (with his head gone under my\nregulation-coat) if I thought it was the judgment-day.\n\nTo this question I \"replied distinctly in the negative\" (as the man of\nthe paper wrote, when I said \"no\" about poaching); and then I cheered\nyoung Watkin up, and told him that nothing more was wanted than to keep\na weather-helm.\n\nBefore his wit could answer helm so much as to clear my meaning, the\nstorm was on me, and broke my pipe, and filled my lungs and all my\npockets, and spoiled every corner of the hat I had bought for my dear\nwife's funeral. I pulled back instantly (almost as quickly as boy Watkin\ncould), and we heard the sand burst over the house, with a rattle like\nshot, and a roar like cannon. And being well inside the walls, we fixed\nour eyes on one another, in the gloom and murkiness, as much as we could\ndo for coughing, to be sure of something.\n\n\"Where is Bardie gone?\" I asked, as soon as my lungs gave speech to me:\nit should have been, \"Where is Bunny gone?\" But my head was full of the\nlittle one.\n\n\"Who can tell?\" cried the boy, in Welsh, being thoroughly scared of his\nEnglish. \"Oh, Dyo dear, God the great only knows.\"\n\n\"God will guard her,\" I said softly, yet without pure faith in it,\nhaving seen such cruel things; but the boy's face moved me. Moreover,\nBardie seemed almost too full of life for quenching; and having escaped\nrocks, waves, and quicksands, surely she would never be wrecked upon dry\nland ignobly. Nevertheless, at the mere idea of those helpless little\nones out in all this raging havoc, tears came to my eyes, until the\nsand, of which the very house was full, crusted up and blinded them.\n\nIt was time to leave off thinking, if one meant to do any good. The\nwhirlwinds spun and whistled round us, now on this side, now on that;\nand the old house creaked and rattled as the weather pulled or pushed at\nit. The sand was drifted in the courtyard (without any special\nwhirlwind) three feet deep in the north-east corner; and the sky, from\nall sides, fell upon us, like a mountain undermined.\n\n\"Boy, go into your mother,\" I said; and I thank God for enabling me,\nelse might she have been childless. \"Tell your mother not to be\nfrightened, but to get your father up, and to have the kettle boiling.\"\n\n\"Oh, Dyo--dear Dyo! let me come with you, after that poor little child,\nand after my five brothers.\"\n\n\"Go in, you helpless fool,\" I said; and he saw the set of my\ncountenance, and left me, though but half-content.\n\nIt needed all my strength to draw the door of the house behind me,\nalthough the wind was bent no more on one way than another, but\nuniversal uproar. And down-roar too; for it fell on my head quite as\nmuch as it jerked my legs, and took me aback, and took me in front, and\nspun me round, and laughed at me. Then of a sudden all wind dropped, and\nyellow sky was over me.\n\nWhat course to take (if I had the choice) in search of those poor\nchildren, was more at first than I could judge, or bring my mind to bear\nupon. For as sure as we live by the breath of the Lord, the blast of His\nanger deadens us.\n\nPerhaps it was my instinct only, having been so long afloat, which drove\nme, straight as affairs permitted, toward the margin of the sea. And\nperhaps I had some desire to know how the sea itself would look under\nthis strange visiting. Moreover, it may have come across me, without any\nthinking twice of it, that Bunny had an inborn trick of always running\ntoward the sea, as behoved a sailor's daughter.\n\nAnyhow, that way I took, so far as it was left to me to know the points\nof the compass, or the shape and manner of anything. For simple and\nshort as the right road was, no simpleton or shortwitted man could have\nhit it, or come near it, in that ravenous weather. In the whirl and\ngrim distortion of the air and the very earth, a man was walking (as you\nmight say) in the depth of a perfect calm, with stifling heat upon him,\nand a piece of shadow to know himself by; and then, the next moment,\nthere he was in a furious state of buffeting, baffled in front, and\nbelaboured aback, and bellowed at under the swing of his arms, and the\nstaggering failure of his poor legs.\n\nNevertheless, in the lull and the slack times, I did my utmost to get\non, having more presence of mind perhaps than any landsman could have\nowned. Poor fellows they are when it comes to blow; and what could they\ndo in a whirlwind?\n\nAs I began to think of them, and my luck in being a seaman, my courage\nimproved to that degree that I was able quite heartily to commend myself\nto the power of God, whom, as a rule, I remember best when the world\nseems coming to an end. And I think it almost certain that this piety on\nmy part enabled me to get on as I did.\n\nFor without any skill at all or bravery of mine, but only the calmness\nwhich fell upon me, as it used to do in the heat of battle, when I\nthought on my Maker, all at once I saw a way to elude a great deal of\nthe danger. This was as simple as could be, yet never would have come\nhome to a man unable to keep his wits about him.\n\nBlurred and slurred as the whole sky was with twisted stuff and with\nyellowness, I saw that the whirling pillars of sand not only whirled but\nalso travelled in one spiral only. They all came from the west, where\nlay the largest spread of sandhills, and they danced away to the\nnorth-east first, and then away to south of east, shaping a round like a\nship with her helm up, preserving their spiral from left to right as all\nwaterspouts do on the north of the Line.\n\nSo when a column of sand came nigh to suck me up, or to bury\nme--although it went thirty miles an hour, and I with the utmost care of\nmy life could not have managed ten perhaps--by porting my helm without\ncarrying sail, and so working a traverse, I kept the weather-gage of it\nand that made all the difference.\n\nOf course I was stung in the face and neck as bad as a thousand\nmusquitoes when the skirts of the whirl flapped round at me, but what\nwas that to care about? It gave me pleasure to walk in such peril, and\nfeel myself almost out of it by virtue of coolness and readiness.\nNevertheless it gave me far greater pleasure, I can assure you, to feel\nhard ground beneath my feet, and stagger along the solid pebbles of the\nbeach of Sker, where the sand-storm could not come so much.\n\nHereupon I do believe that, in spite of all my courage--so stout and\nstrong in the moment of trial--all my power fell away before the sense\nof safety. What could my old battered life matter to any one in the\nworld, except myself and Bunny? However, I was so truly thankful to kind\nProvidence for preserving it, that I cannot have given less than nine\njumps, and said, \"Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,\" three times over, and\nin both ways.\n\nThis brought me back to the world again, as any power of piety always\ndoes when I dwell therein, and it drove me thereupon to trust in\nProvidence no longer than the time was needful for me to recover\nbreathing.\n\nWhen I came to my breath and prudence, such a fright at first oppressed\nme, that I made a start for running into the foremost of the waves,\nthinking (if I thought at all) of lying down there, with my head kept\nup, and defying the sand to quench the sea.\n\nSoon, however, I perceived that this was not advisable. Such a roar\narose around me from the blows of hills and rocks, and the fretful\neagerness of the sea to be at war again, and the deep sound of the\ndistance--the voice of man could travel less than that of a sandpiper,\nand the foot of man might long to be the foot of a sandhopper. For the\nsea was rising fast up the verge of ground-swell, and a deep hoarse echo\nrolling down the shoaling of the surges. This to me was pleasant music,\nsuch as makes a man awake.\n\nThe colour of the sun and sky was just as I had once beholden near the\npearl-grounds of Ceylon, where the bottom of the sea comes up with a\nvery mournful noise, and the fish sing dirges, and no man, however clear\nof eye, can open the sea and the sky asunder. And by this time being\nable to look round a little--for the air was not so full of sand, though\nstill very thick and dusty--I knew that we were on the brink of a kind\nof tornado, as they call it in the tropics,--a storm that very seldom\ncomes into these northern latitudes, being raised by violence of heat,\nas I have heard a surveyor say, the air going upward rapidly, with a\ngreat hole left below it.\n\nNow as I stood on watch, as it were, and, being in such a situation,\nlonged for more tobacco, what came to pass was exactly this--so far as a\nman can be exact when his wits have long been failing him.\n\nThe heaven opened, or rather seemed to be cloven by a sword-sweep, and a\nsolid mass of lightning fell, with a cone like a red-hot anvil. The ring\nof black rocks received its weight, and leaped like a boiling caldron,\nwhile the stormy waters rose into a hiss and heap of steam. Then the\ncrash of heaven stunned me.\n\nWhen I came to myself it was raining as if it had never rained before.\nThe rage of sand and air was beaten flat beneath the rain, and the\nfretful lifting of the sea was hushed off into bubbles. What to do I\ncould not tell, in spite of all experience, but rubbed the sand from\nboth my eyes, as bad as the beard of an oyster, and could see no clear\nway anywhere.\n\nNow the sky was spread and traversed with a net of crossing fires, in\nand out like mesh and needle, only without time to look. Some were\nyellow, some deep red, and some like banks of violet, and others of a\npale sweet blue, like gazing through a window. They might have been very\nbeautiful, and agreeable to consider, if they had been further off, and\nwithout that wicked crack of thunder through the roar. Worse storms I\nhad seen, of course, in the hot world and up mountains, and perhaps\nthought little of them; but then there was this difference, I had always\nplenty of fellows with me, and it was not Sunday. Also, I then was\nyoung, and trained for cannons to be shot at me. Neither had I a boat of\nmy own, but my dear wife was alive.\n\nThese considerations moved me to be careful of my life--a duty which\nincreases on us after the turn of the balance; and seeing all things\nblack behind me, and a world of storm around, knowing every hole as I\ndid, with many commendations of myself to God for the sake of Bunny, in\nI went into a hole under a good solid rock, where I could watch the sea,\nand care for nothing but an earthquake.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nUNDER THE ROCK.\n\n\nFor a while the power of the lightning seemed to quench the wind almost,\nand one continuous roar of thunder rang around the darkness. Then, with\na bellow, the wind sprang forth (like a wild bull out of a mountain),\nand shattered the rain and drowned the thunder, and was lord of\neverything. Under its weight the flat sea quivered, and the crests flew\ninto foam, and the scourge upon the waters seemed to beat them all\ntogether. The whirlwinds now were past and done with, and a violent gale\nbegun, and in the burst and change of movement there appeared a helpless\nship.\n\nShe was bearing towards Pool Tavan, as poor Bardie's boat had done, but\nwithout the summer glory and the golden wealth of waves. All was smooth\nand soft and gentle, as the moonlight in a glass, when the little boat\ncame gliding with its baby captain. All was rough and hard and furious\nas a fight of devils, when that ship came staggering with its load of\nsin and woe. And yet there had not been so much as twenty-four hours\nbetween the two.\n\nNot one of our little coasting vessels, but a full-rigged ship she\nloomed, of foreign build, although at present carrying no colours. I saw\nat once what her business was, to bring from the West Indies sugar, rum,\nand suchlike freight, to Bristol, or to the Dutchmen. This was in her\nclearance-bill; but behind that she had other import not so clearly\nentered. In a word, she carried negroes from the overstocked\nplantations, not to be quite slaves (at least in the opinion of their\nmasters), but to be distributed, for their own Christian benefit, at a\ncertain sum per head, among the Bristol or Dutch merchants, or wherever\nit might be. And it serves them right, I always say; for the fuss that\nwe now make about those black men must bring down the anger of the\nCreator, who made them black, upon us.\n\nAs the gale set to its work, and the sea arose in earnest, and the\nlightning drifted off into the scud of clouds, I saw, as plain as a\npikestaff, that the ship must come ashore, and go to pieces very likely,\nbefore one could say \"Jack Robinson.\" She had been on the Sker-weather\nsands already, and lost her rudder and some of her sternpost, as the\nlift of the water showed; and now there was nothing left on board her of\ncourage or common seamanship. The truth of it was, although of course I\ncould not know it then, that nearly all the ship's company acted as was\nto be expected from a lot of foreigners; that is to say, if such they\nwere. They took to the boats in a kind of panic when first she struck\namong the sands in the whirlwind which began the storm. There could have\nbeen then no great sea running, only quiet rollers; and being but two\nmiles off the shore, they hoped, no doubt, to land well enough, after\nleaving the stupid negroes and the helpless passengers to the will of\nProvidence.\n\nHowever, before they had rowed a mile, with the flood-tide making\neastward, one of the boats was struck by lightning, and the other caught\nin a whirl vorago (as the Spaniards call it), and not a soul ever came\nto land, and scarcely any bodies. Both these accidents were seen from\nPorthcawl Point by Sandy Macraw through a telescope: and much as he was\nmine enemy, I do him the justice to believe it; partly because he could\nlook for no money from any lies in the matter, and still more because I\nhave heard that some people said that they saw him see it.\n\nBut to come back to this poor ship: the wind, though blowing madly\nenough (as a summer gale is often hotter for a while than a winter one),\nhad not time and sweep as yet to raise any very big rollers. The sea was\nsometimes beaten flat and then cast up in hillocks; but the mighty march\nof waters fetched by a tempest from the Atlantic was not come, and would\nnot come in a veering storm like this. For it takes a gale of at least\nthree tides, such as we never have in summer, to deliver the true buffet\nof the vast Atlantic.\n\nNevertheless the sea was nasty and exceeding vicious; and the wind more\nmadly wild, perhaps, than when it has full time to blow; in short, the\nwant of depth and power was made up by rage and spite. And for a ship\nnot thoroughly sound and stanch in all her timbers it had been better,\nperhaps, to rise and fall upon long billows, with a chance of casting\nhigh and dry, than to be twirled round and plucked at, thrown on\nbeam-ends, and taken aback, as this hapless craft was being, in the lash\nof rocky waters and the drift of gale and scud.\n\nBy this time she was close ashore, and not a man (except myself) to help\nor even pity her. All around her was wind and rocks, and a mad sea\nrushing under her. The negroes, crouching in the scuppers, or clinging\nto the masts and rails, or rolling over one another in their want of\npluck and skill, seemed to shed their blackness on the snowy spray and\ncurdled foam, like cuttle-fish in a lump of froth. Poor things! they are\ngrieved to die as much, perhaps, as any white man; and my heart was\novercome, in spite of all I know of them.\n\nThe ship had no canvas left, except some tatters of the fore-topsail,\nand a piece of the main-royals; but she drifted broadside on, I daresay\nfive or six knots an hour. She drew too much water, unluckily, to come\ninto Pool Tavan at that time of the tide, even if the mouth had been\nwide enough; but crash she went on a ledge of rocks thoroughly well\nknown to me, every shelf of which was a razor. Half a cable's length\nbelow the entrance to Pool Tavan, it had the finest steps and stairs for\ncongers and for lobsters, whenever one could get at it in a low\nspring-tide; but the worst of beaks and barbs for a vessel to strike\nupon at half-flow, and with a violent sea, and a wind as wild as Bedlam.\n\nWith the pressure of these, she lay so much to leeward before striking\n(and perhaps her cargo had shifted), that the poor blackies rolled down\nthe deck like pickling walnuts on a tray; and they had not even the\nchance of dying each in his own direction.\n\nI was forced to shut my eyes; till a grey squall came, and caught her\nup, as if she had been a humming-top, and flung her (as we drown a\nkitten) into the mashing waters.\n\nNow I hope no man who knows me would ever take me for such a fool as to\ndream for a moment--after all I have seen of them--that a negro is \"our\nown flesh and blood, and a brother immortal,\" as the parsons begin to\nprate, under some dark infection. They differ from us a great deal more\nthan an ass does from a horse; but for all that I was right down\nglad--as a man of loving-kindness--that such a pelt of rain came up as\nsaved me from the discomfort--or pain, if you must have the truth--of\nbeholding several score, no doubt, of unfortunate blacks a-drowning.\n\nIf it had pleased Providence to drown any white men with them, and to\nlet me know it, beyond a doubt I had rushed in, though without so much\nas a rope to help me; and as it was, I was ready to do my very best to\nsave them if they had only shown some readiness to be hawled ashore by a\nman of proper colour. But being, as negroes always are, of a most\ncontrary nature, no doubt they preferred to drift out to sea rather than\nChristian burial. At any rate, none of them came near me, kindly\ndisposed as I felt myself, and ready to tuck up my Sunday trousers at\nthe very first sight of a woolly head. But several came ashore next\ntide--when it could be no comfort at all to them. And such, as I have\nalways found, is the nature of black people.\n\nBut for me it was a sad, and, as I thought, severe, visitation to be\nforced on a Sabbath-day--my only holiday of the week--to meditate over a\nscene like this. As a truly consistent and truth-seeking Christian\n(especially when I go round with fish on a Monday morning among\nNonconformists), it was a bitter trial for me to reflect upon those\npoor negroes, gone without any sense at all, except of good Christians'\nwickedness, to the judgment we decree for all, except ourselves and\nfamilies.\n\nBut there was worse than this behind; for after waiting as long as there\nseemed good chance of anything coming ashore, which might go into my\npocket, without risk of my pension, and would truly be mine in all\nhonesty--and after seeing that the wreck would not break up till the\ntide rose higher, though all on board were swept away--suddenly it came\ninto my head about poor Bardie and Bunny. They were worth all the\nniggers that ever made coal look the colour of pipeclay; and with a\ndepth of self-reproach which I never deserved to feel, having truly done\nmy utmost--for who could walk in such weather?--forth I set, resolved to\nface whatever came out of the heavens. Verily nothing could come much\nworse than what was come already. Rheumatics, I mean, which had struck\nme there, under the rock, as a snake might. Three hours ago all the\nworld was sweat, and now all the air was shivers. Such is the climate of\nour parts, and many good people rail at it, who have not been under\ndiscipline. But all who have felt that gnawing anguish, or that fiery\nfreezing, burning at once and benumbing (like a dead bone put into the\nlive ones, with a train of powder down it)--all these will have pity for\na man who had crouched beneath a rock for at least three hours, with\ndripping clothes, at the age of two-and-fifty.\n\nFor a hero I never set up to be, and never came across one until my old\nage in the navy, as hereafter to be related. And though I had served on\nboard of one in my early years, off La Hague and Cape Grisnez, they told\nme she was only a woman that used to hold a lantern. Hero, however, or\nno hero, in spite of all discouragement and the aching of my bones,\nresolved I was to follow out the fate of those two children. There\nseemed to be faint hope, indeed, concerning the little stranger; but\nBunny might be all alive and strong, as was right and natural for a\nchild of her age and substance. But I was sore downcast about it when I\nlooked around and saw the effect of the storm that had been over them.\nFor the alteration of everything was nothing less than amazing.\n\nIt is out of my power to tell you how my heart went up to God, and all\nmy spirit and soul was lifted into something purer, when of a sudden, in\na scoop of sand, with the rushes overhanging, I came on those two little\ndears, fast asleep in innocence. A perfect nest of peace they had, as if\nbeneath their Father's eye, and by His own hand made for them. The fury\nof the earth and sky was all around and over them; the deep revenge of\nthe sea was rolling, not a hundred yards away; and here those two little\ndots were asleep, with their angels trying to make them dream.\n\nBunny, being the elder and much the stronger child, had thrown the skirt\nof her frock across poor little Bardie's naked shoulders; while Bardie,\nfinding it nice and warm, had nestled her delicate head into the lap of\nher young nurse, and had tried (as it seemed), before dropping off, to\ntell her gratitude by pressing Bunny's red hands to her lips. In a word,\nyou might go a long way and scarcely see a prettier or more moving\npicture, or more apt to lead a man who seldom thinks of his Maker. As\nfor me, I became so proud of my own granddaughter's goodness, and of the\nlittle lady's trust and pure repose therein, that my heart went back at\nonce to my dead boy Harry, and I do believe that I must have wept, if I\ncould have stopped to look at them.\n\nBut although I was truly loath to spoil this pretty picture, the poor\nthings must be partly wet, even in that nest of rushes, which the\nwhirlwinds had not touched. So I awoke them very gently, and shook off\nthe sand, while they rubbed their eyes, and gaped, and knew no more of\ntheir danger than if they had been in their own dear beds. Then, with\nBardie in my arms, and Bunny trotting stoutly with her thumb spliced\ninto my trousers, I shaped a course for Sker farmhouse, having a strong\ngale still abaft, but the weather slightly moderating.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nA WRECKER WRECKED.\n\n\nNear the gate I met Evan Thomas, the master of the house himself, at\nlength astir, but still three-parts drunk, and--if I may say so with due\ncompassion for the trouble then before him--in a very awkward state of\nmind. It happened so that the surliness of his liquor and of his nature\nmingled at this moment with a certain exultation, a sense of good-luck,\nand a strong desire to talk and be told again of it. And this is the\nnature of all Welshmen; directly they have any luck, they must begin to\nbrag of it. You will find the same in me perhaps, or, at any rate, think\nyou do, although I try to exclude it, having to deal with Englishmen,\nwho make nothing of all the great deeds they have done until you begin\nto agree with them. And then, my goodness, they do come out! But the\nobject of my writing is to make them understand us, which they never yet\nhave done, being unlike somehow in nature, although we are much of their\nfathers.\n\nHaving been almost equally among both these nations, and speaking\nEnglish better perhaps than my native tongue of the Cymry--of which\nanybody can judge who sees the manner in which I do it--it is against my\nwish to say what Evan Thomas looked like. His dark face, overhung with\nhair, and slouched with a night of drinking, was beginning to burn up,\nfrom paleness and from weariness, into a fury of plunder. Scarcely did I\nknow the man, although I had so many recollections of evil against him.\nA big, strong, clumsy fellow at all times, far more ready to smite than\nsmile, and wholly void of that pleasant humour, which among almost all\nmy neighbours--though never yet could I find out why--creates a pleasing\neagerness for my humble society as punctual as my pension-day.\n\nBut now his reeling staggering manner of coming along towards us, and\nthe hunching of his shoulders, and the swagging of his head, and, most\nof all, the great gun he carried, were enough to make good quiet people\nwho had been to church get behind a sandhill. However, for that it was\ntoo late. I was bound to face him. Bardie dropped her eyes under my\nbeard, and Bunny crept closer behind my leg. For my part, although the\nway was narrow, and the lift of the storm gave out some light, it would\nhave moved no resentment in me if he had seen (as rich men do) unfit to\nsee a poor man.\n\nHowever, there was no such luck. He carried his loaded gun with its\nmuzzle representing a point of view the very last I could have\ndesired--namely, at my midships; and he carried it so that I longed to\nhave said a little word about carefulness. But I durst not, with his\ncoal-black eyes fixed upon me as they were, and so I pulled up suddenly.\nFor he had given me an imperious nod, as good as ordering me to stop.\n\n\"Wreck ashore!\" he cried out in Welsh, having scarce a word of\nEnglish--\"wreck ashore! I smell her, Dyo. Don't tell me no lies, my boy.\nI smelled her all the afternoon. And high time to have one.\"\n\n\"There is a wreck ashore,\" I answered, looking with some disgust at him,\nas a man who has been wrecked himself must do at a cruel wrecker; \"but\nthe ebb most likely will draw her off and drift her into the\nquicksands.\"\n\n\"Great God! speak not like that, my boy. The worst you are of\neverything. If those two children came ashore, there must have been\nsomething better.\" And he peered at the children as if to search for any\ngold upon them.\n\n\"Neither child came from that wreck. One is my granddaughter Bunny.\nBunny, show yourself to black Evan.\" But the child shrank closer behind\nme. \"Evan black, you know her well. And the other is a little thing I\npicked up on the coast last night.\"\n\n\"Ha, ha! you pick up children where you put them, I suppose. But take\nthem indoors and be done with them. Cubs to come with a wreck ashore, a\nnoble wreck ashore, I say! But come you down again, fisherman Dyo.\" He\nused the word \"fisherman\" with a peculiar stress, and a glance of\nsuspicion at my pockets. \"Come you down again, Dyo dear. I shall want\nyou to help me against those thieves from Kenfig. Bring my other gun\nfrom the clock-case, and tell the boys to run down with their\nbando-sticks. I'll warrant we'll clear the shore between us; and then,\ngood Dyo, honest Dyo, you shall have some--you shall, you dog.\nFair-play, Dyo; fair share and share, though every stick is mine of\nright. Ah, Dyo, Dyo, you cunning sheep's head, you love a keg of rum,\nyou dog.\"\n\nThis I knew to be true enough, but only within the bounds of both\nhonesty and sobriety. But so much talking had made his brain, in its\npresent condition, go round again; and while I was thinking how far it\nmight be safe and right to come into his views, his loaded gun began\nwagging about in a manner so highly dangerous, that for the sake of the\ntwo poor children I was obliged to get out of his way, and, looking back\nfrom a safer distance, there I beheld him flourishing with his arms on\nthe top of a sandhill, and waving his hat on the top of his gun, for\nhis sons to come over the warren.\n\nMoxy Thomas was very kind; she never could help being so, and therefore\nnever got any thanks. She stripped the two wet children at once, and put\nthem in bed together to keep each other warm. But first she had them\nsnugly simmering in a milk-pan of hot water with a little milk for the\nsake of their skins. Bunny was heavy and sleepy therein, and did nothing\nbut yawn and stretch out her arms. Bardie, on the other hand, was ready\nto boil over with delight and liveliness, flashing about like a little\ndab-chick.\n\n\"Old Davy,\" she said, as I came to see her at her own invitation, and\nshe sate quite over Bunny, \"'Ill 'a have a ickle dop?\" With the water up\nto her neck, she put one mite of a transparent finger to my grizzled\nmouth, and popped a large drop in, and laughed, until I could have\nworshipped her.\n\nNow, having seen these two little dears fast asleep and warmly\ncompassed, I began, according to Evan's orders, to ask about the boys,\nnot having seen any sign of them. Moxy said that Watkin went out to look\nfor his five brothers about an hour after I had left, and in spite of\nthe rain and lightning. She had tried in vain to stop him: something was\non his mind, it seemed; and when she went up to attend on his father, he\ntook the opportunity to slip out of the kitchen.\n\nNow Moxy having been in the house, and the house away from the worst of\nthe storm, being moreover a woman, and therefore wholly abroad about\nweather, it was natural that she should not have even the least idea of\nthe jeopardy encountered by her five great sons in the warren. Enough\nfor her that they were not at sea. Danger from weather upon dry land was\nout of her comprehension.\n\nIt wanted perhaps half an hour of dusk, and had given over raining, but\nwas blowing a good reef-topsail gale, when I started to search for the\nsons of Sker. Of course I said nothing to make their mother at all\nuneasy about them, but took from the clock-case the loaded gun (as Evan\nhad commanded me), and set forth upon the track of young Watkin, better\nfoot foremost. For he was likely to know best what part of the warren\nhis five great brothers had chosen for their sport that day; and in the\nwet sand it was easy to follow the course the boy had taken.\n\nThe whirlwinds had ceased before he went forth, and the deluge of rain\nwas now soaked in, through the drought so long abiding. But the wind was\nwailing pitifully, and the rushes swaying wearily; and the yellow\nbaldness, here and there, of higher sandhills, caught the light. Ragged\nclouds ran over all, and streamers of the sunset; and the sky was like a\nschool let loose, with the joy of wind and rain again. It is not much of\nme that swears, when circumstances force me; only a piece, perhaps, of\ncustom, and a piece of honesty. These two lead one astray sometimes; and\nthen comes disappointment. For I had let some anger vex me at the\nrudeness of black Evan, and the ungodliness of his sons, which forced me\nthus to come abroad, when full of wet and weariness. In spite of this,\nI was grieved and frightened, and angry with no one but myself, when I\nchanced upon boy Watkin, fallen into a tuft of rushes, with his blue\neyes running torrents. There he lay, like a heap of trouble, as young\nfolk do ere they learn the world; and I put him on his legs three times,\nbut he managed to go down again. At last I got his knees to stick; but\neven so he turned away, and put his head between his hands, and could\nnot say a word to me. And by the way his shoulders went, I knew that he\nwas sobbing. I asked him what the matter was, and what he was taking so\nmuch to heart; and, not to be too long over a trifle, at last I got this\nout of him:--\n\n\"Oh, good Mr Llewellyn, dear, I never shall see nothing more of my great\nbrothers five, so long as ever I do live. And when they kicked me out of\nbed every Sunday morning, and spread the basins over me, it was not that\nthey meant to harm--I do feel it, I do feel it; and perhaps my knees ran\ninto them. Under the sands, the sands, they are; and never to kick me\nagain no more! Of sorrow it is more than ever I can tell.\"\n\n\"Watty,\" said I, \"why talk you so? Your brothers know every crick and\ncorner of this warren, miles and miles; and could carry a sandhill\namong them. They are snug enough somewhere with their game, and perhaps\ngone to sleep, like the little ones.\"\n\nOf the babies' adventures he knew nothing, and only stared at me; so I\nasked him what had scared him so.\n\n\"Under the sands, the sands, they are, so sure as ever I do live. Or the\nrabbit-bag would not be here, and Dutch, who never, never leaves them,\nhowling at the rabbit-bag!\"\n\nLooking further through the tussocks, I saw that it was even so. Dutch,\nthe mongrel collie, crouched beside a bag of something, with her tail\ncurled out of sight, and her ears laid flat and listless, and her jowl\nalong the ground. And every now and then she gave a low but very\ngrievous howl.\n\n\"Now, boy, don't be a fool,\" I said, with the desire to encourage him;\n\"soon we shall find your brothers five, with another great sack of\nrabbits. They left the bitch yonder to watch the sack, while they went\non for more, you see.\"\n\n\"It is the sack; the sack it is! And no other sack along of them. Oh, Mr\nLlewellyn, dear, here is the bag, and there is Dutch, and never no sign\nat all of them!\"\n\nAt this I began to fear indeed that the matter was past helping--that\nan accident and a grief had happened worse than the drowning of all the\nnegroes, which it has ever pleased Providence (in a darkness of mood) to\ncreate for us. But my main desire was to get poor Watty away at once,\nlest he should encounter things too dreadful for a boy like him.\n\n\"Go home,\" I said, \"with the bag of rabbits, and give poor Dutch her\nsupper. Your father is down on the shore of the sea, and no doubt the\nboys are with him. They are gone to meet a great shipwreck, worth all\nthe rabbits all the way from Dunraven to Giant's Grave.\"\n\n\"But little Dutch, it is little Dutch! They never would leave her, if\nwreck there was. She can fetch out of the water so good almost as any\ndog.\"\n\nI left him to his own devices, being now tired of arguing. For by this\ntime it was growing dark; and a heavy sea was roaring; and the wreck was\nsure to be breaking up, unless she had been swallowed up. And the\ncommon-sense of our village, and parish, would go very hard against me\nfor not being on the spot to keep the adjacent parish from stealing. For\nKenfig and Newton are full of each other, with a fine old ancient\nhatred. So we climbed over the crest of high sand, where the rushes lay\nweltering after the wind; and then with a plunge of long strides down\nhill, and plucking our feet out hastily, on the watered marge we stood,\nto which the sea was striving.\n\nAmong the rocks black Evan leaped, with white foam rushing under him,\nand sallies of the stormy tide volleying to engulf him. Strong liquor\nstill was in his brain, and made him scorn his danger, and thereby saved\nhim from it. One timid step, and the churning waters would have made a\ncurd of him. The fury of his visage showed that somebody had wronged\nhim, after whom he rushed with vengeance, and his great gun swinging.\n\n\"Sons of dogs!\" he cried in Welsh, alighting on the pebbles; \"may the\ndevil feed their fathers with a melting bowl!\"\n\n\"What's the rumpus now?\" I asked; \"what have your sons been doing?\"\n\nFor he always swore at his sons as freely as at anybody's, and at\nhimself for begetting them.\n\n\"My sons!\" he cried, with a stamp of rage; \"if my sons had been here,\nwhat man would have dared to do on the top of my head this thing? Where\nare they? I sent you for them.\"\n\n\"I have sought for them high and low,\" I answered; \"here is the only one\nI could find.\"\n\n\"Watkin! What use of Watkin? A boy like a girl or a baby! I want my five\ntall bully-boys to help their poor father's livelihood. There's little\nTom tailor gone over the sandhills with a keg of something; and Teddy\nshoemaker with a spar; and I only shot between them! Cursed fool! what\nshall I come to, not to be able to shoot a man?\"\n\nHe had fired his gun, and was vexed, no doubt, at wasting a charge so\nrandomly; then spying his other gun on my shoulder, with the flint and\nthe priming set, he laid his heavy hand on it. I scarce knew what to do,\nbut feared any accident in the struggle; and after all, he was not so\ndrunk that the law would deny him his own gun.\n\n\"Ha, ha!\" with a pat of the breech, he cried; \"for this I owe thee a\ngood turn, Dyo. Thou art loaded with rocks, my darling, as the other was\nwith cowries. Twenty to the pound of lead for any long-shore robbers. I\nsee a lot more sneaking down. Dyo, now for sport, my boy.\"\n\nI saw some people, dark in the distance, under the brow of a sandhill;\nand before I could speak or think, black Evan was off to run at them. I\ntoo set my feet for speed, but the strings of my legs hung backward; and\nWatty, who could run like a hare, seemed to lag behind me. And behind\nhim there was little Dutch, crawling with her belly down, and her eyes\nturned up at us, as if we were dragging her to be hanged.\n\nUntil we heard a shout of people, through the roar of wind and sea, in\nfront of where black Evan strode; and making towards it, we beheld, in\nglimmering dusk of shore and sky, something we knew nothing of.\n\nA heavy sandhill hung above them, with its brow come over; and long\nroots of rushes naked in the shrillness of the wind. Under this were men\nat work, as we work for lives of men; and their Sunday shirt-sleeves\nflashed, white like ghosts, and gone again. Up to them strode Evan\nblack, over the marge of the wild March tides; and grounded his gun and\nlooked at them. They for a breath gazed up at him, and seemed to think\nand wonder; and then, as though they had not seen him, fell again\na-digging.\n\n\"What means this?\" he roared at them, with his great eyes flashing fire,\nand his long gun levelled. But they neither left their work nor lifted\nhead to answer him. The yellow sand came sliding down, in wedge-shaped\nrunnels, over them, and their feet sank out of sight; but still they\nkept on working.\n\n\"Come away, then, Evan great; come away and seek for wreck,\" I shouted,\nwhile he seemed to stand in heaviness of wonder. \"This is not a place\nfor you. Come away, my man, my boy.\"\n\nThus I spoke, in Welsh of course, and threw my whole weight on his arm,\nto make him come away with me. But he set his feet in sand, and spread\nhis legs, and looked at me; and the strongest man that was ever born\ncould not have torn him from his hold, with those eyes upon him.\n\n\"Dyo, I am out of dreaming. Dyo, I must see this wreck; only take the\ngun from me.\"\n\nThis I would have done right gladly, but he changed his mind about it,\nfalling back to a savage mood.\n\n\"You down there, who gave you leave to come and dig my sandhills?\nAnswer, or have skins of lead.\"\n\nTwo or three of the men looked up, and wanted to say something. But the\nhead-man from the mines, who understood the whole of them, nodded, and\nthey held their tongues. Either they were brave men all (which never is\nwithout discipline), or else the sense of human death confused and\noverpowered them. Whatever they meant, they went on digging.\n\n\"Some damned sailor under there,\" cried Evan, losing patience; \"little\nmustard-spoons of sand. Can't you throw it faster? Fine young fellows\nthree of them, in the hole their own ship made, last March tide, it must\nhave been. Let us see this new batch come. They always seem to have\nspent their wages before they learn to drown themselves.\"\n\nHe laughed and laid his gun aside, and asked me for tobacco, and, trying\nto be sober, sang \"the rising of the lark.\" I, for my part, shrunk away,\nand my flesh crawled over me.\n\n\"Work away, my lads, work away. You are all of a mind to warm\nyourselves. Let me know when you have done. And all you find belongs to\nme. I can sit and see it out, and make a list of everything. Ear-rings\ngold, and foreign pieces, and the trinkets they have worn. Out with\nthem! I know them all. Fools! what use of skulking? You are on soft\nstuff, I see. Have out every one of them.\"\n\nSo they did; and laid before him, in the order of their birth, the\ncarcases of his five sons. Evan first, his eldest born; Thomas next, and\nRees, and Hopkin, and then (with the sigh of death still in him) Jenkin,\nnewly turned fifteen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nHOW TO SELL FISH.\n\n\nWhat I had seen that night upset me more than I like to dwell upon. But\nwith all my fish on hand, I was forced to make the best of it. For a\ndown-hearted man will turn meat, as we say, and much more, fish, to a\nfarthing's-worth. And though my heart was sore and heavy for my ancient\nsweetheart Moxy, and for little Bardie in the thick of such disasters,\nthat could be no excuse to me for wasting good fish--or at least pretty\ngood--and losing thoroughly good money.\n\nHere were the mullet, with less of shine than I always recommended and\nhonestly wish them to possess; here were the prawns, with a look of\npaleness and almost of languishing, such as they are bound to avoid\nuntil money paid and counted; and most of all, here were lawful bass, of\nvery great size and substance, inclined to do themselves more justice in\nthe scales than on the dish.\n\nI saw that this would never answer to my present high repute. Concerning\nquestions afterwards, and people being hard upon me, out of thoughtless\nignorance, that was none of my affair. The whole of that would go, of\ncourse, upon the weather and sudden changes, such as never were known\nbefore. And if good religious people would not so be satisfied with the\nwill of Providence to have their fish as fish are made, against them I\nhad another reason, which never fails to satisfy.\n\nThe \"burning tide,\" as they called it (through which poor Bardie first\nappeared), had been heard of far inland, and with one consent pronounced\nto be the result of the devil improperly flipping his tail while\nbathing. Although the weather had been so hot, this rumour was beyond my\nbelief; nevertheless I saw my way, if any old customer should happen,\nwhen it came to his dinner-time, to be at all discontented (which no man\nwith a fine appetite and a wholesome nose should indulge in)--I saw my\nway to sell him more, upon the following basket-day, by saying what good\npeople said, and how much I myself had seen of it.\n\nWith these reflections I roused my spirits, and resolved to let no good\nfish be lost, though it took all the week to sell them. For, in spite of\nthe laws laid down in the books (for young married women, and so\nforth), there is scarcely any other thing upon which both men and women\nmay be led astray so pleasantly as why to buy fish, and when to buy\nfish, and what fish to buy.\n\nTherefore I started in good spirits on the Monday morning, carrying with\nme news enough to sell three times the weight I bore, although it was\nbreaking my back almost. Good fish it was, and deserved all the praise\nthat ever I could bestow on it, for keeping so well in such shocking\nweather; and so I sprinkled a little salt in some of the delicate\nplaces, just to store the flavour there; for cooks are so forgetful, and\nalways put the blame on me when they fail of producing a fine fresh\nsmell.\n\nAlso knowing, to my sorrow, how suspicious people are, and narrow-minded\nto a degree none would give them credit for, I was forced to do a thing\nwhich always makes me to myself seem almost uncharitable.\n\nBut I felt that I could trust nobody to have proper faith in me,\nespecially when they might behold the eyes of the fishes retire a\nlittle, as they are very apt to do when too many cooks have looked at\nthem. And knowing how strong the prejudice of the public is in this\nrespect, I felt myself bound to gratify it, though at some cost of time\nand trouble. This method I do not mind describing (as I am now pretty\nclear of the trade) for the good of my brother fishermen.\n\nWhen the eyes of a fish begin to fail him through long retirement from\nthe water, you may strengthen his mode of regarding the world (and\ntherefore the world's regard for him) by a delicate piece of handling.\nKeep a ray-fish always ready--it does not matter how stale he is--and on\nthe same day on which you are going to sell your bass, or mullet, or\ncod, or whatever it may be, pull a few sharp spines, as clear as you\ncan, out of this good ray. Then open the mouth of your languid fish and\nembolden the aspect of either eye by fetching it up from despondency\nwith a skewer of proper length extended from one ball to the other. It\nis almost sure to drop out in the cooking; and even if it fails to do\nso, none will be the wiser, but take it for a provision of nature--as\nindeed it ought to be.\n\nNow, if anybody is rude enough to gainsay your fish in the market, you\nhave the evidence of the eyes and hands against that of the nose alone.\n\"Why, bless me, madam,\" I used to say, \"a lady like you, that\nunderstands fish a great deal better than I do! His eyes are coming out\nof his head, ma'am, to hear you say such things of him. Afloat he was at\nfour this morning, and his eyes will speak to it.\" And so he was, well\nafloat in my tub, before I began to prepare him for a last appeal to the\npublic. Only they must not float too long, or the scales will not be\nstiff enough.\n\nBeing up to a few of these things, and feeling very keenly how hard the\npublic always tries to get upper hand of me, and would beat me down to\nhalf nothing a pound (if allowed altogether its own way), I fought very\nbravely the whole of that Monday to turn a few honest shillings. \"Good\nold Davy, fine old Davy, brave old Davy!\" they said I was every time I\nabated a halfpenny; and I called them generous gentlemen and\nChristian-minded ladies every time they wanted to smell my fish, which\nis not right before payment. What right has any man to disparage the\nproperty of another? When you have bought him, he is your own, and you\nhave the title to canvas him; but when he is put in the scales, remember\n\"nothing but good of the dead,\" if you remember anything.\n\nAs I sate by the cross roads in Bridgend on the bottom of a bucket, and\nwith a four-legged dressing-table (hired for twopence) in front of me,\nwho should come up but the well-known Brother Hezekiah? Truly tired I\nwas getting, after plodding through Merthyr Mawr, Ogmore, and Ewenny,\nLlaleston, and Newcastle, and driven at last to the town of Bridgend.\nFor some of my fish had a gamesome odour, when first I set off in the\nmorning; and although the rain had cooled down the air, it was now\nbecome an unwise thing to recommend what still remained to any man of\nunchristian spirit, or possessing the ear of the magistrates.\n\nNow perhaps I should not say this thing, and many may think me inclined\nto vaunt, and call me an old coxcomb; but if any man could sell stinking\nfish in the times of which I am writing--and then it was ten times\nharder than now, because women looked after marketing--that man I verily\nbelieve was this old Davy Llewellyn; and right he has to be proud of it.\nBut what were left on my hands that evening were beginning to get so\nstrong, that I feared they must go over Bridgend bridge into the river\nOgmore.\n\nThe big coach with the London letters, which came then almost twice\na-week, was just gone on, after stopping three hours to rest the horses\nand feed the people; and I had done some business with them, for London\nfolk for the most part have a kind and pleasing ignorance. They paid me\nwell, and I served them well with fish of a fine high flavour; but now I\nhad some which I would not offer to such kind-hearted gentry.\n\nHezekiah wanted fish. I saw it by his nostrils, and I knew it for\ncertain when he pretended not to see me or my standing. He went a good\nbit round the corner, as if to deal with the ironmonger. But for all\nthat, I knew as well as if I could hear his wife beginning to rake the\nfire, that fish for supper was the business which had brought him across\nthe bridge. Therefore I refused an offer which I would have jumped at\nbefore seeing Hezekiah, of twopence a-pound for the residue from an old\nwoman who sold pickles; and I made up my mind to keep up the price,\nknowing the man to have ten in family, and all blessed with good\nappetites.\n\n\"What, Davy! Brother Davy!\" he cried, being compelled to begin, because\nI took care not to look at him. \"Has it been so ordered that I behold\ngood brother Davy with fish upon a Monday?\" His object in this was plain\nenough--to beat down my goods by terror of an information for\nSabbath-labour.\n\n\"The Lord has been merciful to me,\" I answered, patting my best fish on\nhis shoulder; \"not only in sending them straight to my net, at nine\no'clock this morning; but also, brother Hezekiah, in the hunger all\npeople have for them. I would that I could have kept thee a taste; not\nsoon wouldst thou forget it. Sweeter fish and finer fish never came out\nof Newton Bay\"--this I said because Newton Bay is famous for high\nquality. \"But, brother Hezekiah, thou art come too late.\" And I began to\npack up very hastily.\n\n\"What!\" cried Hezekiah, with a keen and hungrily grievous voice; \"all\nthose fish bespoken, Davy?\"\n\n\"Every one of them bespoken, brother; by a man who knows a right down\ngood bass, better almost than I do. Griffy, the 'Cat and Snuffers.'\"\n\nNow, Griffith, who kept the \"Cat and Snuffers,\" was a very jovial man,\nand a bitter enemy to Hezekiah Perkins; and I knew that the latter would\ngladly offer a penny a-pound upon Griffy's back, to spoil him of his\nsupper, and to make him offend his customers.\n\n\"Stop, brother Davy,\" cried Hezekiah, stretching out his broad fat\nhands, as I began to pack my fish, with the freshest smellers uppermost;\n\"Davy dear, this is not right, nor like our ancient friendship. A rogue\nlike Griffy to cheat you so! What had he beaten you down to, Davy?\"\n\n\"Beaten me down!\" I said, all in a hurry; \"is it likely I would be\nbeaten down, with their eyes coming out of their heads like that?\"\n\n\"Now, dear brother Dyo, do have patience! What was he going to give you\na-pound?\"\n\n\"Fourpence a-pound, and ten pound of them. Three-and-fourpence for a lot\nlike that! Ah, the times are bad indeed!\"\n\n\"Dear brother Dyo, fourpence-halfpenny! Three-and-nine down, for the lot\nas it stands.\"\n\n\"Hezekiah, for what do you take me? Cut a farthing in four, when you get\nit. Do I look a likely man to be a rogue for fivepence?\"\n\n\"No, no, Davy; don't be angry with me. Say as much as tenpence.\nFour-and-twopence, ready money; and no Irish coinage.\"\n\n\"Brother Hezekiah,\" said I, \"a bargain struck is a bargain kept. Rob a\nman of his supper for tenpence!\"\n\n\"Oh, Dyo, Dyo! you never would think of that man's supper, with my wife\nlonging for fish so! Such a family as we have, and the weakness in\nHepzibah's back! Five shillings for the five, Davy.\"\n\n\"There, there; take them along,\" I cried at last, with a groan from my\nchest: \"you are bound to be the ruin of me. But what can I do with a\ndelicate lady? Brother, surely you have been a little too hard upon me.\nWhatever shall I find to say to a man who never beats me down?\"\n\n\"Tell that worldly 'Cat and Snuffers' that your fish were much too\ngood--why, Davy, they seem to smell a little!\"\n\n\"And small use they would be, Hezekiah, either for taste or for\nnourishment, unless they had the sea-smell now. Brother, all your money\nback, and the fish to poor Griffy, if you know not the smell of salt\nwater yet.\"\n\n\"Now, don't you be so hot, old Davy. The fish are good enough, no doubt;\nand it may be from the skewer-wood; but they have a sort, not to say a\nsmell, but a manner of reminding one----\"\n\n\"Of the savoury stuff they feed on,\" said I; \"and the thorough good use\nthey make of it. A fish must eat, and so must we, and little blame to\nboth of us.\"\n\nWith that he bade me \"good-night,\" and went with alacrity towards his\nsupper, scornfully sneering as he passed the door of the \"Cat and\nSnuffers.\" But though it was a fine thing for me, and an especial\nProvidence, to finish off my stock so well, at a time when I would have\ntaken gladly a shilling for the lot of it, yet I felt that circumstances\nwere against my lingering. Even if Hezekiah, unable to enter into the\nvein of my fish, should find himself too fat to hurry down the steep\nhill after me, still there were many other people, fit for supper, and\nfresh for it, from the sudden coolness, whom it was my duty now to\npreserve from mischief; by leaving proper interval for consideration,\nbefore I might happen to be in front of their dining room windows\nanother day.\n\nTherefore, with a grateful sense of goodwill to all customers, I thought\nit better to be off. There I had been, for several hours, ready to prove\nanything, but never challenged by anybody; and my spirit had grown\naccordingly. But I never yet have found it wise to overlie success. Win\nit, and look at it, and be off, is the quickest way to get some more. So\nI scarcely even called so much as a pint at the \"Cat and Snuffers,\" to\nhave a laugh with Griffy; but set off for Newton, along the old road,\nwith a good smart heel, and a fine day's business, and a light heart\ninside of me.\n\nWhen I had passed Red-hill and Tythegston, and clearly was out upon\nNewton Down, where the glow-worms are most soft and sweet, it came upon\nme, in looking up from the glow-worms to the stars of heaven, to think\nand balance how far I was right in cheating Hezekiah. It had been done\nwith the strictest justice, because his entire purpose was purely to\ncheat me. Whereupon Providence had stepped in and seen that I was the\nbetter man. I was not so ungrateful--let nobody suppose it--as to repine\nat this result. So far from that, that I rattled my money and had a good\nlaugh, and went on again. But being used to watch the stars, as an old\nsailor is bound to do, I thought that Orion ought to be up, and I could\nnot see Orion. This struck me as an unkindly thing, although, when I\nthought of it next day, I found that Orion was quite right, and perhaps\nthe beer a little strong which had led me to look out for him; anyhow,\nit threw me back to think of Hezekiah, and make the worst of him to\nmyself for having had the best of him.\n\nEverybody may be sure that I never would have gone out of the way to\ndescribe my traffic with that man unless there were good reason. Nay,\nbut I wanted to show you exactly the cast and the colour of man he was,\nby setting forth his low attempt to get my fish for nothing.\n\nThere was no man, of course, in my native village, and very few in\nBridgend perhaps, to whom I would have sold those fish, unless they were\ngoing to sell it again. But Hezekiah Perkins, a member and leading elder\nof the \"Nicodemus-Christians,\" was so hard a man to cheat--except by\nstirring of his gall--and so keen a cheat himself; so proud, moreover,\nof his wit and praying, and truly brotherly,--that to lead him astray\nwas the very first thing desired by a sound Churchman.\n\nBy trade and calling he had been--before he received his special\ncall--no more than a common blacksmith. Now a blacksmith is a most\nuseful man, full of news and full of jokes, and very often by no means\ndrunk; this, however, was not enough to satisfy Hezekiah. Having parts,\nas he always told us--and sometimes we wished that he had no\nwhole--cultivated parts, moreover, and taken up by the gentry, nothing\nof a lower order came up to his merits than to call himself as follows:\n\"Horologist, Gunsmith, Practical Turner, Working Goldsmith and Jeweller,\nMaker of all Machinery, and Engineman to the King and Queen.\"\n\nThe first time he put this over his door, all the neighbours laughed at\nhim, knowing (in spite of the book he had got full of figures and shapes\nand crossings, which he called \"Three-gun-ometry\") that his education\nwas scarcely up to the rule of three, without any guns. Nevertheless he\ngot on well, having sense enough to guide him when to talk large (in the\npresence of people who love large talk, as beyond them), and when to\nsing small, and hold his tongue, and nod at the proper distances, if\never his business led him among gentry of any sense or science, such as\nwe sometimes hear of. Hence it was that he got the order to keep the\nchurch-clock of Bridgend a-going by setting the hands on twice a-day,\nand giving a push to the pendulum; and so long as the clock would only\ngo, nobody in the town cared a tick whether it kept right time or wrong.\nAnd if people from the country durst say anything about it, it was\nalways enough to ask them what their own clocks had to say.\n\nThere were not then many stable-clocks, such as are growing upon us now,\nso that every horse has his own dinner-bell; only for all those that\nwere, Hezekiah received, I daresay, from five to ten shillings a-month\napiece in order to keep them moving. But, bless my heart! he knew less\nof a clock than I, old Davy Llewellyn, and once on a time I asked him,\nwhen he talked too much of his \"ometries\"--as a sailor might do in his\nsimpleness--I asked him to take an \"observation,\" as I had seen a good\ndeal of it. But all he did was to make a very profane and unpleasant\none. As for this man's outward looks, he was nothing at all particular,\nbut usually with dirt about him, and a sense of oiliness. Why he must\nneeds set up for a saint the father of evil alone may tell; but they\nsaid that the clock that paid him best (being the worst in the\nneighbourhood) belonged to a Nicodemus-Christian, with a great cuckoo\nover it. Having never seen it, I cannot say; and the town is so full of\ngossip that I throw myself down on my back and listen, being wholly\nunable to vie with them in depth or in compass of story-telling, even\nwhen fish are a week on my hands.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nTHE CORONER AND THE CORONET.\n\n\nAn officer of high repute had lately been set over us, to hold account\nof the mischief, and to follow evidence, and make the best he could of\nit when anybody chose to die without giving proper notice. He called\nhimself \"Coroner of the King;\" and all the doctors, such as they were,\nmade it a point that he must come, whenever there was a dead man or\nwoman who had died without their help.\n\nNow all about the storm of sand, and all about the shipwreck, was known\nin every part of the parish, before the church clock had contrived, in\ngratitude to Hezekiah, to strike the noon of Monday. Every child that\nwent to the well knew the truth of everything; and every woman of Newton\nand Nottage had formed from the men her own opinion, and was ready to\nstand thereby, and defy all the other women.\n\nNevertheless some busy doctor (who had better been in the stocks) took\nit for a public duty to send notice and demand for the Coroner to sit\nupon us. The wrath of the parish (now just beginning to find some wreck,\nthat would pay for the ropes) was so honest and so grave, that the\nlittle doctor was compelled to run and leave his furniture. And so it\nalways ought to be with people who are meddlesome.\n\nIt came to my knowledge that this must happen, and that I was bound to\nhelp in it, somewhere about middle-day of Tuesday; at a time when I was\nnot quite as well as I find myself when I have no money. For, being\npleased with my luck perhaps, and not content quite to smoke in the\ndark, and a little dry after the glow-worms, it happened (I will not\npretend to say how) that I dropped into the \"Jolly Sailors,\" to know\nwhat the people could be about, making such a great noise as they were,\nand keeping a quiet man out of his bed.\n\nThere I smelled a new tobacco, directly I was in the room; and somebody\n(pleased with my perception) gave me several pipes of it, with a\nthimbleful--as I became more and more agreeable--of a sort of\nrum-and-water. And, confining myself, as my principle is, to what the\npublic treat me to, it is not quite out of the question that I may have\nbeen too generous. And truly full I was of grief, upon the following\nmorning, that somebody had made me promise, in a bubbling moment, to be\nthere again, and bring my fiddle, on the Tuesday night.\n\nNow, since the death of my dear wife, who never put up with my fiddle\n(except when I was courting her), it had seemed to my feelings to be\nalmost a levity to go fiddling. Also I knew what everybody would begin\nto say of me; but the landlord, foreseeing a large attendance after the\nCoroner's inquest, would not for a moment hear of any breach of my\nfiddle pledge.\n\nHalf of Newton, and perhaps all Nottage, went to Sker the following day\nto see the Coroner, and to give him the benefit of their opinions. And\nanother piece of luck there was to tempt them in that direction. For the\nship which had been wrecked and had disappeared for a certain time, in a\nmost atrocious manner, was rolled about so by the tide and a shift of\nthe wind on Monday, that a precious large piece of her stern was in\nsight from the shore on Tuesday morning. It lay not more than a cable's\nlength from low-water mark, and was heaved up so that we could see as\nfar as the starboard mizzen-chains. Part of the taffrail was carried\naway, and the carving gone entirely, but the transom and transom-knees\nstood firm; and of the ship's name done in gold I could make out in\nlarge letters TA LUCIA; and underneath, in a curve, and in smaller\nletters, ADOR.\n\nOf course no one except myself could make head or tail of this; but\nafter thinking a little while, I was pretty sure of the meaning of\nit--namely, that the craft was Portuguese, called the Santa Lucia, and\ntrading from San Salvador, the capital of Brazils. And in this opinion I\nwas confirmed by observing through my spy-glass, copper bolt-heads of a\npattern such as I had seen at Lisbon, but never in any British ship.\nHowever, I resolved, for the present, to keep my opinion to myself,\nunless it were demanded upon good authority. For it made me feel\nconfused in mind, and perhaps a little uneasy, when, being struck by\nsome resemblance, I pulled from the lining of my hat a leaf of a book,\nupon which I copied all that could be made out of the letters, each side\nof the tiller of my new boat; and now I found them to be these,--UC from\nthe starboard side, just where they would have stood in Lucia--and DOR\nfrom the further end of the line, just as in San Salvador.\n\nThe sands were all alive with people, and the rocks, and every place\nwhere anything good might have drifted. For Evan Thomas could scarcely\ncome at a time of such affliction to assert his claims of wreck, and to\nbelabour right and left. Therefore, for a mile or more, from where the\nland begins to dip, and the old stone wall, like a jagged cord, divides\nour parish from Kenfig, hundreds of figures might be seen, running along\nthe grey wet sands, and reflected by their brightness. The day was going\nfor two of the clock, and the tide growing near to the turn of ebb; and\nthe landsprings oozing down from the beach, spread the whole of the flat\nsands so, with a silver overlaying, that without keen sight it was hard\nto tell where the shore ended and sea began. And a great part of this\nspace was sprinkled with naked feet going pattering--boys and girls, and\nyoung women and men, who had left their shoes up high on the rocks to\nhave better chance in the racing.\n\nNow it is not for me to say that all or half of these good people were\nso brisk because they expected any fine thing for themselves. I would\nnot even describe them as waiting in readiness for the force of fortune\nby the sea administered. I believe that all were most desirous of doing\ngood, if possible. In the first case, to the poor people drowned; but if\ntoo late, then to console any disconsolate relations: failing of which,\nit would be hard if anybody should blame them for picking up something\nfor themselves.\n\n\"What! you here, mother Probyn?\" I cried, coming upon a most pious old\nwoman, who led the groaning at Zoar Chapel, and being for the moment\nstruck out of all my manners by sight of her.\n\n\"Indeed, and so I am, old Davy,\" she answered, without abashment, and\nalmost too busy to notice me; \"the Lord may bless my poor endeavours to\nrescue them poor Injuns. But I can't get on without a rake. If I had\nonly had the sense to bring my garden-rake. There are so many little\nthings, scarcely as big as cockleshells; and the waves do drag them away\nfrom me. Oh, there, and there goes another! Gwenny, if I don't smack\nyou!\"\n\nAll these people, and all their doings, I left with a sort of contempt,\nperhaps, such as breaks out on me now and then at any very great\nlittleness. And I knew that nothing worth wet of the knees could be\nfound with the ebb-tide running, and ere the hold of the ship broke up.\n\nSo I went toward the great house, whose sorrows and whose desolation\nthey took little heed of. And nothing made me feel more sad--strange as\nit may seem, and was--than to think of poor black Evan, thus unable to\nstand up and fight for his unrighteous rights.\n\nIn the great hall were six bodies, five of strong young men laid quiet,\neach in his several coffin; and the other of a little child in a simple\ndress of white, stretched upon a piece of board. Death I have seen in\nall his manners, since I was a cabin-boy, and I took my hat off to the\nbodies, as I had seen them do abroad; but when I saw the small dead\nchild, a thrill and pang of cold went through me. I made sure of nothing\nelse, except that it was dear Bardie. That little darling whom I loved,\nfor her gifts direct from God, and her ways, so out of the way to all\nother children--it struck my heart with a power of death, that here this\nlively soul was dead.\n\nWhen a man makes a fool of himself, anybody may laugh at him; and this\ndoes him good, perhaps, and hardens him against more trouble. But bad as\nI am, and sharp as I am, in other people's opinion (and proud sometimes\nto think of it), I could not help a good gulp of a tear, over what I\nbelieved to be the body of poor little Bardie. For that child had such\nnice ways, and took such upper hand of me; that, expecting to find a\nCaptain always, especially among women----\n\n\"Old Davy, I 'ants 'a. Old Davy, 'hen is 'a coming?\"\n\nBy the union-jack, it was as good as a dozen kegs of rum to me. There\nwas no mistaking the sweetest and clearest voice ever heard outside of a\nflute. And presently began pit-pat of the prettiest feet ever put in a\nshoe, down the great oak staircase. She held on by the rails, and showed\nno fear at all about it, though the least slip might have killed her.\nThen she saw the sad black sight after she turned the corner, and\nwondered at the meaning of it, and her little heart stood still. As she\nturned to me in awe, and held out both hands quivering, I caught her\nup, and spread my grey beard over her young frightened eyes, and took\nher out of sight of all those cold and very dreadful things.\n\nI had never been up the stairs before in that dark and ancient house;\nand the length, and the width, and the dreariness, and the creaking\nnoises, frightened me; not so much for my own sake (being never required\nto sleep there), but for the tender little creature, full already of\ntimid fancies, who must spend the dark nights there. And now the house,\nleft empty of its noise, and strength, and boastfulness, had only five\nmore ghosts to wander silent through the silent places. And this they\nbegan the very night after their bodies were in the churchyard.\n\nThe Coroner came on an old white pony, nearly four hours after the time\nfor which his clerk had ordered us. Being used, for my part, to royal\ndiscipline, and everything done to the minute fixed, with the captain's\nvoice like the crack of a gun, I was vexed and surprised; but expected\nhim to give us some reason, good or bad. Instead of that he roared out\nto us, with his feet still in both stirrups, \"Is there none of you\nTaffies with manners enough to come and hold a gentleman's horse? Here\nyou, Davy Jones, you are long enough, and lazy enough; put your hand to\nthe bridle, will you?\"\n\nThis was to me, who was standing by, in the very height of innocence,\nhaving never yet seen any man appointed to sit upon dead bodies, and\ndesiring to know how he could help them. I did for his Honour all I\ncould, although his manner of speech was not in any way to my liking.\nBut my rule has always been that of the royal navy, than which there is\nno wiser. If my equal insults me, I knock him down; if my officer does\nit, I knock under.\n\nMeanwhile our people were muttering \"Sassenach, Sassenach!\" And from\ntheir faces it was plain that they did not like an Englishman to sit\nupon Cymric bodies. However, it was the old, old thing. The Welsh must\ndo all the real work; and the English be paid for sitting upon them\nafter they are dead.\n\n\"I never sate on a black man yet, and I won't sit on a black man now,\"\nthe Coroner said, when he was sure about oats enough for his pony; \"I'll\nnot disgrace his Majesty's writ by sitting upon damned niggers.\"\n\n\"Glory be to God, your Honour!\" Stradling Williams cried, who had come\nas head of the jury: clerk he was of Newton Church, and could get no\nfees unless upon a Christian burial: \"we thought your Honour would\nhardly put so great a disgrace upon us; but we knew not how the law\nlay.\"\n\n\"The law requires no Christian man,\" pronounced the Crowner, that all\nmight hear, \"to touch pitch, and defile himself. Both in body and soul,\nMaster Clerk, to lower and defile himself!\"\n\nHereupon a high hard screech, which is all we have in Wales for the\nbrave hurrah of Englishmen, showed that all the jury were of one accord\nwith the Coroner: and I was told by somebody that all had shaken hands,\nand sworn to strike work, rather than put up with misery of conscience.\n\n\"But, your Honour,\" said Mr Lewis, bailiff to Colonel Lougher, \"if we\nhold no quest on the black men, how shall we certify anything about this\nterrible shipwreck?\"\n\n\"The wreck is no concern of mine,\" answered the Crowner, crustily: \"it\nis not my place to sit upon planks, but upon Christian bodies. Do you\nattend to your own business, and leave mine to me, sir.\"\n\nThe bailiff, being a nice quiet man, thought it best to say no more. But\nsome of the people who were thronging from every direction to see his\nHonour, told him about the little white baby found among the\nbladder-weed. He listened to this, and then he said,--\n\n\"Show me this little white infant discovered among the black men. My\nbusiness here is not with infants, but with five young smothered men.\nHowever, if there be an infant of another accident, and of Christian\ncolour, I will take it as a separate case, and damn the county in the\nfees.\"\n\nWe assured his lordship, as every one now began to call him (in virtue\nof his swearing so, which no doubt was right in a man empowered to make\nother people swear), we did our best at any rate to convince the\nCrowner, that over and above all black men, there verily was a little\nchild, and, for all one could tell, a Christian child, entitled to the\nchurchyard, and good enough for him to sit on. And so he entered the\nhouse to see it.\n\nBut if he had sworn a little before (and more than I durst set down for\nhim), he certainly swore a great deal now, and poured upon us a bitter\nheat of English indignation. All of the jury were taken aback; and I as\na witness felt most uneasy; until we came to understand that his\nHonour's wrath was justly kindled on account of some marks on the baby's\nclothes.\n\n\"A coronet!\" he cried, stamping about; \"a coronet on my young lord's\npinafore, and you stupid oafs never told me!\"\n\nNobody knew except myself (who had sailed with an earl for a captain)\nwhat the meaning of this thing was; and when the clerk of the church was\nasked, rather than own his ignorance, he said it was part of the arms of\nthe crown; and the Crowner was bound like a seal by it.\n\nThis explanation satisfied all the people of the parish, except a few\nfar-going Baptists, with whom it was a point of faith always to cavil\nand sneer at every \"wind of doctrine\" as they always called it--the\nscent of which could be traced, anyhow, to either the parson or the\nclerk, or even the gravedigger. But I was content to look on and say\nnothing, having fish to sell, at least twice a-week, and finding all\ncustomers orthodox, until they utter bad shillings.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nIN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EVIDENCE.\n\n\nThere is no need for me to follow all the Crowner's doings, or all that\nthe juries thought and said, which was different altogether from what\nthey meant to think and say. And he found himself bound to have two of\nthem, with first right of inquest to the baby because of the stamp on\nhis pinafore. And here I was, foreman of the jury, with fifteenpence for\nmy services, and would gladly have served on the other jury after\nwalking all that way, but was disabled for doing so, and only got\nninepence for testimony. With that, however, I need not meddle, as every\none knows all about it; only, to make clear all that happened, and,\nindeed, to clear myself, I am forced to put before you all that we did\nabout that baby, as fully and emphatically as the state of our doings\nupon that occasion permitted me to remember it.\n\nFor the Coroner sate at the head of the table, in the great parlour of\nthe house; and the dead child came in on his board, and we all regarded\nhim carefully, especially heeding his coronet mark, and then set him by\nthe window. A fine young boy enough to look at, about the age of our\nBardie, and might have been her twin-brother, as everybody vowed he was,\nonly his face was bolder and stronger, and his nose quite different,\nand altogether a brave young chap, instead of funny and delicate. All\nthis, however, might well have come from knocking about in the sea so\nmuch.\n\nI would have given a good half-crown to have bitten off my foolish\ntongue, when one of the jurymen stood up and began to address the\nCoroner. He spoke, unluckily, very good English, and his Honour was glad\nto pay heed to him. And the clerk put down nearly all he said, word for\nword, as might be. This meddlesome fellow (being no less than brother\nHezekiah's self) nodded to me for leave to speak, which I could not deny\nhim; and his Honour lost no time whatever to put his mouth into his\nrummer of punch, as now provided for all of us, and to bow (whenever his\nmouth was empty) to that Hezekiah. For the man had won some reputation,\nor rather had made it, for himself, by perpetual talking, as if he were\nskilled in the history and antiquities of the neighbourhood. Of these he\nmade so rare a patchwork, heads and tails, prose, verse, and proverbs,\nhistories, and his stories, that (as I heard from a man of real teaching\nand learning who met him once and kept out of his way ever after) any\none trusting him might sit down in the chair of Canute at King Arthur's\ntable. Not that I or any of my neighbours would be the worse for doing\nthat; only the thought of it frightened us, and made us unwilling to\nhearken him much.\n\nHowever, if there was any matter on which Hezekiah deserved to be heard,\nno doubt it was this upon which he was now delivering his opinions--to\nwit, the great inroad or invasion of the sand, for miles along our\ncoast; of which there are very strange things to tell, and of which he\nhad made an especial study, having a field at Candleston with a shed\nupon it and a rick of hay, all which disappeared in a single night, and\nnone was ever seen afterwards. It was the only field he had, being left\nto him by his grandmother; and many people were disappointed that he had\nnot slept with his cow that night. This directed his attention to the\nserious consideration, as he always told us at first start, being a\nlover of three-decked words, of the most important contemplation which\ncould occupy the attention of any Cambrian landowner.\n\n\"Show your land,\" cried a wag of a tailor, with none to cross his legs\nupon; but we put him down, and pegged him down, till his manners should\nbe of the pattern-book. Hezekiah went on to tell, in words too long to\nanswer the helm of such a plain sailor as I am, how the sweep of\nhundreds of miles of sand had come up from the west and south-west in\nonly two hundred and fifty years. How it had first begun to flow about\nthe Scilly Islands, as mentioned by one Borlase, and came to the mouth\nof Hayle river, in Cornwall, in the early years of King Henry VIII., and\nafter that blocked up Bude Haven, and swallowed the ploughs in the\narable land. Then at Llanant it came like a cloud over the moon one\nwinter night, and buried five-and-thirty houses with the people in them.\n\nAn Act of Parliament was passed--chapter the second of Philip and\nMary--to keep it out of Glamorganshire; and good commissioners were\nappointed, and a survey made along the coast, especially of Kenfig.\nNevertheless the dash of sand was scarcely on their ink, when swarming,\ndriving, darkening the air, the storm swept on their survey. At the\nmouths of the Tawey and Afan rivers the two sailors' chapels were\nburied, and then it swept up the great Roman road, a branch of the\nJulian way, and smothered the pillars of Gordian, and swallowed the\ncastle of Kenfig, which stood by the side of the western road; and still\nrushing eastward, took Newton village and Newton old church beneath it.\nAnd so it went on for two hundred years, coming up from the sea, no\ndoubt, carried by the perpetual gales, which always are from the south\nand west--filling all the hollow places, changing all bright mossy pools\ninto hills of yellow drought, and, like a great encampment, dwelling\nover miles and leagues of land. And like a camp it was in this, that it\nwas always striking tent. Six times in the last few years had the\nhighest peak of sand--the general's tent it might be called--been\nshifted miles away, perhaps, and then come back towards Ogmore; and it\nwas only the other day that, through some shift or swirl of wind, a\nwindmill, with its sails entire, had been laid bare near Candleston, of\nwhich the last record was in Court-rolls of a hundred and fifty years\nagone.[A]\n\nNow all this, though Hezekiah said it, was true enough, I do believe,\nhaving heard things much to the same purpose from my own old\ngrandfather. The Coroner listened with more patience than we had given\nhim credit for, although he told us that brother Perkins should have\nreserved his learned speech for the second inquiry, which was to be\nabout the deaths of the five young men; for to him it appeared that\nthis noble infant must lay the blame of his grievous loss not on the\nsand but upon the sea. Hezekiah replied, with great deference, that the\ncause in both cases was the same, for that the movement of sand went\non under the sea even more than ashore, and hence the fatal gulfing of\nthat ship, the Andalusia, and the loss of his young lordship.\n\nThe name he had given the ship surprised me; and indeed I felt sure that\nit was quite wrong; and so I said immediately, without any low\nconsideration of what might be mine own interest. But the Coroner would\nnot hearken to me, being much impressed now with the learning and wisdom\nof Hezekiah Perkins. And when Hezekiah presented his card, beginning\nwith \"horologist,\" and ending with the \"king and queen,\" he might have\nhad any verdict he liked, if he himself had been upon trial.\n\nTherefore, after calling in (for the sake of form) the two poor women\nwho found the dead baby among the sea-weed, and had sevenpence apiece\nfor doing so, and who cried all the while that they talked in Welsh\n(each having seen a dear baby like him not more than twenty years ago),\nwe came in the most unanimous manner, under his lordship's guidance, to\nthe following excellent verdict:--\n\n\"Found drowned on Pool Tavan rocks, a man-child, supposed to be two\nyears old; believed to be a young nobleman, from marks on pinafore, and\nhigh bearing; but cast away by a storm of sand from the ship Andalusia\nof Appledore.\"\n\nNow I was as certain, as sure could be, that half of this verdict must\nbe wrong; especially as to the name of the ship, and her belonging to\nAppledore, which never yet owned any craft of more than 200 tons at the\nutmost--a snow, or a brig at the very outside. Nevertheless I was\ncompelled to give in to the rest of them, and most of all to the\nCoroner. Only I said, as many who are still alive can remember, and are\nnot afraid to speak to, and especially my good friend Mr Lewis, \"The\nship was not called the Andalusia; the ship was never from Appledore;\nneither was she of British build. As an old seaman, it is likely that I\nknow more of the build of a ship than a lubber of a clock-maker, or\nrather a clock-mauler.\"\n\nBut here I was put down sternly; and hearing of verdicts a great deal\nworse, without any mischief come of them, I was even content to sign the\nreturn, and have a new pipe of bird's-eye. And a bird's-eye view this\ngave me of them at the second inquest wherein I had to give evidence;\nand was not of the jury. They wanted to cross-examine me, because I had\nbeen unpleasant, but of that they got the worst, and dropped it. But as\nall our jurymen declared upon their oaths that the little nobleman was\ndrowned in a storm of sand, so they found that the five young rabbiters\ncame to their end of smothering through a violent sea-tempest.\n\nIn the days of my youth such judgments perhaps would have tried my\npatience; but now I knew that nothing ever follows truth and justice.\nPeople talk of both these things, and perhaps the idea does them good.\n\nBe that according to God's will--as we always say when deprived of our\nown--at any rate, I am bound to tell one little thing more about each\nquest. And first about the first one. Why was I so vexed and angry with\nmy foolish tongue when Hezekiah began to speak? Only because I knew full\nwell that it would lead to the very thing, which it was my one desire to\navoid, if possible. And this--as you may guess at once, after what\nhappened on the stairs--was the rude fetching and exposing of the dear\nlittle maid among so many common fellows; and to show her the\nbaby-corpse. I feared that it must come to this, through my own\nthoughtless blabbing about her \"ickle bother\" in the presence of\nHezekiah: and if ever man had a hollow dry heart from over-pumping of\nthe tongue, I had it when Hezekiah came in; bearing, in a depth of\nfright and wonder, and contempt of him, my own delicate Bardie. I had\nset my back against the door, and sworn that they should not have her;\nbut crafty Perkins had stolen out by another door while they humoured\nme. Now my pretty dear was awed, and hushed beyond all crying, and even\ncould not move her feet, as children do, in a kicking way. Trying to get\nas far as possible from Hezekiah's nasty face--which gave me a great\ndeal of pleasure, because she had never done the like to me, unless I\nwere full of tobacco--she stretched away from his greasy shoulder, and\nthen she saw old Davy. Her hands came toward me, and so did her eyes,\nand so did her lips, with great promise of kisses, such as her father\nand mother perhaps might have been mightily tempted by; but nobody now\nto care for them.\n\nWhen Hezekiah, pretending to dandle this little lady in a jaunty way,\nlike one of his filthy low children, was taking her towards that poor\nlittle corpse, so white in the light of the window; and when he made\nher look at it, and said, \"Is that ickle bother, my dear?\" and she all\nthe time was shivering and turning her eyes away from it, and seeking\nfor me to help her, I got rid of the two men who held me, nor hearkened\nI the Coroner, but gave Hezekiah such a grip as he felt for three months\nafterwards, and with Bardie on my left arm, kept my right fist ready.\n\nNobody cared to encounter this; for I had happened to tell the\nneighbourhood how the Frenchman's head came off at the time when he\ntried to injure me; and so I bore off the little one, till her chest\nbegan to pant and her tears ran down my beard. And then as I spoke\nsoftly to her and began to raise her fingers, and to tickle her frizzy\nhair, all of a sudden she flung both arms around my neck, and loved me.\n\n\"Old Davy, poor ickle Bardie not go to 'e back pit-hole yet?\"\n\n\"No, my dear, not for ever so long. Not for eighty years at least. And\nthen go straight to heaven!\"\n\n\"Ickle bother go to 'e back pit-hole? Does 'a think, old Davy?\"\n\nThis was more than I could tell, though inclined to think it very\nlikely. However, before I could answer, some of the jury followed us,\nand behind them the Coroner himself; they insisted on putting a question\nto her, and so long as they did not force her again to look at that\nwhich terrified her, I had no right to prevent them. They all desired to\nspeak at once; but the clerk of the Coroner took the lead, having as yet\nperformed no work toward the earning of his salt or rum. An innocent old\nman he was, but very free from cleanliness; and the child being most\nparticular of all ever born in that matter, turned away with her mite of\na nose, in a manner indescribable.\n\nHe was much too dull to notice this; but putting back his spectacles,\nand stooping over her hair and ears (which was all she left outside my\nbeard), he wanted to show his skill in babies, of which he boasted\nhimself a grandfather. And so he began to whisper,--\n\n\"My little dear, you will be a good child--a very good child; won't you,\nnow? I can see it in your little face. Such a pretty dear you are! And\nall good children always do as they are told, you know. We want you to\ntell us a little thing about pretty little brother. I have got a little\ngirl at home not so old as you are, and she is so clever, you can't\nthink. Everything she does and says; everything we tell her----\"\n\n\"Take ayay 'e nasty old man. Take ayay 'e bad old man; or I never tis 'a\nagain, old Davy.\"\n\nShe flashed up at me with such wrath, that I was forced to obey her;\nwhile the old man put down his goggles to stare, and all the jury\nlaughed at him. And I was running away with her, for her little breath\nwas hot and short; when the Coroner called out, \"Stop, man; I know how\nto manage her.\" At this I was bound to pull up, and set her to look at\nhim, as he ordered me. She sate well up in my arms, and looked, and\nseemed not to think very highly of him.\n\n\"Look at his Honour, my dear,\" said I, stroking her hair as I knew she\nliked; \"look at his lordship, you pretty duck.\"\n\n\"Little child,\" began his Honour, \"you have a duty to perform, even at\nthis early period of your very beginning life. We are most desirous to\nspare your feelings, having strong reasons to believe that you are\nsprung from a noble family. But in our duty towards your lineage, we\nmust require you, my little dear--we must request you, my little\nlady--to assist us in our endeavour to identify----\"\n\n\"I can say 'dentify,' old Davy; tell 'e silly old man to say 'dentify'\nsame as I does.\"\n\nShe spread her little open hand with such contempt at the Coroner, that\neven his own clerk could not keep his countenance from laughing. And his\nHonour, having good reason to think her a baby of high position before,\nwas now so certain that he said, \"God bless her! What a child she is!\nTake her away, old mariner. She is used to high society.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nA VERDICT ON THE JURY.\n\n\nAs to the second inquest, I promised (as you may remember) to tell\nsomething also. But in serious truth, if I saw a chance to escape it,\nwithout skulking watch, I would liefer be anywhere else almost--except\nin a French prison.\n\nAfter recording with much satisfaction our verdict upon Bardie's\nbrother--which nearly all of us were certain that the little boy must\nbe--the Coroner bade his second jury to view the bodies of the five\nyoung men. These were in the great dark hall, set as in a place of\nhonour, and poor young Watkin left to mind them; and very pale and ill\nhe looked.\n\n\"If you please, sir, they are all stretched out, and I am not afraid of\nthem;\" he said to me, as I went to console him: \"father cannot look at\nthem; but mother and I are not afraid. They are placed according to\ntheir ages, face after face, and foot after foot. And I am sure they\nnever meant it, sir, when they used to kick me out of bed: and\noftentimes I deserved it.\"\n\nI thought much less of those five great corpses than of the gentle and\nloving boy who had girt up his heart to conquer fear, and who tried to\nthink evil of himself for the comforting of his brethren's souls.\n\nBut he nearly broke down when the jurymen came; and I begged them to\nspare him the pain and trial of going before the Coroner to identify the\nbodies, which I could do, as well as any one; and to this they all\nagreed.\n\nWhen we returned to the long oak parlour, we found that the dignity of\nthe house was maintained in a way which astonished us. There had been\nsome little refreshment before, especially for his Honour; but now all\nthese things were cleared away, and the table was spread with a noble\nsight of glasses, and bottles, and silver implements, fit for the mess\nof an admiral. Neither were these meant for show alone, inasmuch as to\nmake them useful, there was water cold and water hot, also lemons, and\nsugar, and nutmeg, and a great black George of ale, a row of pipes, and\na jar of tobacco, also a middling keg of Hollands, and an anker of old\nrum. At first we could hardly believe our eyes, knowing how poor and\ndesolate, both of food and furniture, that old grange had always been.\nBut presently one of us happened to guess, and Hezekiah confirmed it,\nthat the lord of the manor had taken compassion upon his afflicted\ntenant, and had furnished these things in a handsome manner, from his\nown great house some five miles distant. But in spite of the custom of\nthe country, I was for keeping away from it all, upon so sad an\noccasion. And one or two more were for holding aloof, although they cast\nsheep's-eyes at it.\n\nHowever, the Crowner rubbed his hands, and sate down at the top of the\ntable, and then the foreman sate down also, and said that, being so much\nupset, he was half inclined to take a glass of something weak. He was\nrecommended, if he felt like that, whatever he did, not to take it weak,\nbut to think of his wife and family; for who could say what such a turn\nmight lead to, if neglected? And this reflection had such weight, that\ninstead of mixing for himself, he allowed a friend to mix for him.\n\nThe Crowner said, \"Now, gentlemen, in the presence of such fearful\ntrouble and heavy blows from Providence, no man has any right to give\nthe rein to his own feelings. It is his duty, as a man, to control his\nsad emotions; and his duty, as a family-man, to attend to his\nconstitution.\" With these words he lit a pipe, and poured himself a\nglass of Hollands, looking sadly upward, so that the measure quite\nescaped him. \"Gentlemen of the jury,\" he continued with such authority,\nthat the jury were almost ready to think that they must have begun to be\ngentlemen--till they looked at one another; \"gentlemen of the jury, life\nis short, and trouble long. I have sate upon hundreds of poor people who\ndestroyed themselves by nothing else than want of self-preservation. I\nhave made it my duty officially to discourage such shortcomings. Mr\nForeman, be good enough to send the lemons this way; and when ready for\nbusiness, say so.\"\n\nCrowner Bowles was now as pleasant as he had been grumpy in the morning;\nand finding him so, we did our best to keep him in that humour. Neither\nwas it long before he expressed himself in terms which were an honour\nalike to his heart and head. For he told us, in so many words--though I\nwas not of the jury now, nevertheless I held on to them, and having been\nforeman just now, could not be, for a matter of form, when it came to\nglasses, cold-shouldered,--worthy Crowner Bowles, I say, before he had\nstirred many slices of lemon, told us all, in so many words--and the\nmore, the more we were pleased with them--that for a thoroughly honest,\nintelligent, and hard-working jury, commend him henceforth and as long\nas he held his Majesty's sign-manual, to a jury made of Newton parish\nand of Kenfig burgesses!\n\nWe drank his health with bumpers round, every man upon his legs, and\nthen three cheers for his lordship; until his clerk, who was rather\nsober, put his thumb up, and said \"Stop.\" And from the way he went on\njerking with his narrow shoulders, we saw that he would recall our\nthoughts to the hall that had no door to it. Then following his looks,\nwe saw the distance of the silence.\n\nThis took us all aback so much, that we had in the witnesses--of whom I\nthe head man was there already--and for fear of their being nervous, and\nso confusing testimony, gave them a cordial after swearing. Everybody\nknew exactly what each one of them had to say. But it would have been\nvery hard, and might have done them an injury, not to let them say it.\n\nThe Coroner, having found no need to charge (except his rummer), left\nhis men for a little while to deliberate their verdict.\n\n\"Visitation of God, of course it must be,\" Stradling Williams began to\nsay; \"visitation of Almighty God.\"\n\nSome of the jury took the pipes out of their mouths and nodded at him,\nwhile they blew a ring of smoke; and others nodded without that trouble;\nand all seemed going pleasantly. When suddenly a little fellow, whose\nname was Simon Edwards, a brother of the primitive Christians, or at\nleast of their minister, being made pugnacious by ardent spirits, rose,\nand holding the arm of his chair, thus delivered his sentiments;\nspeaking, of course, in his native tongue.\n\n\"Head-man, and brothers of the jury, I-I-I do altogether refuse and deny\nthe goodness of that judgment. The only judgment I will certify is in\nthe lining of my hat,--'Judgment of Almighty God, for rabbiting on the\nSabbath-day.' Hezekiah Perkins, I call upon thee, as a brother\nChristian, and a consistent member, to stand on the side of the Lord\nwith me.\"\n\nHis power of standing on any side was by this time, however, exhausted;\nand falling into his chair he turned pale, and shrunk to the very back\nof it. For over against him stood Evan Thomas, whom none of us had seen\ntill then. It was a sight that sobered us, and made the blood fly from\nour cheeks, and forced us to set down the glass.\n\nThe face of black Evan was ashy grey, and his heavy square shoulders\nslouching forward, and his hands hung by his side. Only his deep eyes\nshone without moving; and Simon backed further and further away, without\nany power to gaze elsewhere. Then Evan Thomas turned from him, without\nany word, or so much as a sigh, and looked at us all; and no man had\npower to meet the cold quietness of his regard. And not having thought\nmuch about his troubles, we had nothing at all to say to him.\n\nAfter waiting for us to begin, and finding no one ready, he spake a few\nwords to us all in Welsh, and the tone of his voice seemed different.\n\n\"Noble gentlemen, I am proud that my poor hospitality pleases you. Make\nthe most of the time God gives; for six of you have seen the white\nhorse.\" With these words he bowed his head, and left us shuddering in\nthe midst of all the heat of cordials. For it is known that men, when\nprostrate by a crushing act of God, have the power to foresee the death\nof other men that feel no pity for them. And to see the white horse on\nthe night of new moon, even through closed eyelids, and without sense of\nvision, is the surest sign of all sure signs of death within the\ntwelvemonth. Therefore all the jury sate glowering at one another, each\nman ready to make oath that Evan's eyes were not on him.\n\nNow there are things beyond our knowledge, or right of explanation, in\nwhich I have a pure true faith--for instance, the \"Flying Dutchman,\"\nwhom I had twice beheld already, and whom no man may three times see,\nand then survive the twelvemonth; in him, of course, I had true\nfaith--for what can be clearer than eyesight? Many things, too, which\nbrave seamen have beheld, and can declare; but as for landsmen's\nsuperstitions, I scarcely cared to laugh at them. However, strange\nenough it is, all black Evan said came true. Simon Edwards first went\noff, by falling into Newton Wayn, after keeping it up too late at\nchapel. And after him the other five, all within the twelvemonth; some\nin their beds, and some abroad, but all gone to their last account. And\nheartily glad I was for my part (as one after other they dropped off\nthus), not to have served on that second jury; and heartily sorry I was\nalso that brother Hezekiah had not taken the luck to behold the white\nhorse.\n\nPlain enough it will be now, to any one who knows our parts, that after\nwhat Evan Thomas said, and the way in which he withdrew from us, the\nonly desire the jury had was to gratify him with their verdict, and to\nhasten home, ere the dark should fall, and no man to walk by himself on\nthe road. Accordingly, without more tobacco, though some took another\nglass for strength, they returned the following verdict:--\n\n\"We find that these five young and excellent men\"--here came their\nnames, with a Mister to each--\"were lost on their way to a place of\nworship, by means of a violent storm of the sea. And the jury cannot\nseparate without offering their heartfelt pity\"--the Crowner's clerk\nchanged it to 'sympathy'--\"to their bereaved and affectionate parents.\nGod save the King!\"\n\nAfter this, they all went home; and it took good legs to keep up with\nthem along \"Priest Lane,\" in some of the darker places, and especially\nwhere a white cow came, and looked over a gate for the milking-time. I\ncould not help laughing, although myself not wholly free from\nuneasiness; and I grieved that my joints were not as nimble as those of\nSimon Edwards.\n\nBut while we frightened one another, like so many children, each\nperceiving something which was worse to those who perceived it not,\nHezekiah carried on as if we were a set of fools, and nothing ever could\nfrighten him. To me, who was the bravest of them, this was very irksome;\nbut it happened that I knew brother Perkins's pet belief. His wife had\nlived at Longlands once, a lonely house between Nottage and Newton, on\nthe rise of a little hill. And they say that on one night of the year,\nall the funerals that must pass from Nottage to Newton in the\ntwelvemonth, go by in succession there, with all the mourners after\nthem, and the very hymns that they will sing passing softly on the wind.\n\nSo as we were just by Longlands in the early beat of the stars, I\nmanaged to be at Perkins's side. Then suddenly, as a bat went by, I\ncaught the arm of Hezekiah, and drew back, and shivered.\n\n\"Name of God, Davy! what's the matter?\"\n\n\"Can't you see them, you blind-eye? There they go! there they\ngo! All the coffins with palls to them. And the names upon the\nhead-plates:--Evan, and Thomas, and Hopkin, and Rees, and Jenkin, with\nonly four bearers! And the psalm they sing is the thirty-fourth.\"\n\n\"So it is! I can see them all. The Lord have mercy upon my soul! Oh\nDavy, Davy! don't leave me here.\"\n\nHe could not walk another step, but staggered against the wall and\ngroaned, and hid his face inside his hat. We got him to Newton with much\nado; but as for going to Bridgend that night, he found that our\nchurch-clock must be seen to, the very first thing in the morning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nTRUTH LIES SOMETIMES IN A WELL.\n\n\nThe following morning it happened so that I did not get up over early;\nnot, I assure you, from any undue enjoyment of the grand Crowner's\nquests; but partly because the tide for fishing would not suit till the\nafternoon, and partly because I had worked both hard and long at the\n\"Jolly Sailors:\" and this in fulfilment of a pledge from which there was\nno escaping, when I promised on the night before to grease and tune my\nviolin, and display the true practice of hornpipe. Rash enough this\npromise was, on account of my dear wife's memory, and the things bad\npeople would say of it. And but for the sad uneasiness created by black\nEvan's prophecy, and the need of lively company to prevent my seeing\nwhite horses, the fear of the parish might have prevailed with me over\nall fear of the landlord. Hence I began rather shyly; but when my first\ntune had been received with hearty applause from all the room, how could\nI allow myself to be clapped on the back, and then be lazy?\n\nNow Bunny was tugging and clamouring for her bit of breakfast, almost\nbefore I was wide-awake, when the latch of my cottage-door was lifted,\nand in walked Hezekiah. Almost any other man would have been more\nwelcome; for though he had not spoken of it on the day before, he was\nsure to annoy me, sooner or later, about the fish he had forced me to\nsell him. When such a matter is over and done with, surely no man, in\ncommon-sense, has a right to reopen the question. The time to find fault\nwith a fish, in all conscience, is before you have bought him. Having\nonce done that, he is now your own; and to blame him is to find fault\nwith the mercy which gave you the money to buy him. A foolish thing as\nwell; because you are running down your own property, and spoiling your\nrelish for him. Conduct like this is below contempt; even more\nungraceful and ungracious than that of a man who spreads abroad the\nfaults of his own wife.\n\nHezekiah, however, on this occasion, was not quite so bad as that. His\nerrand, according to his lights, was of a friendly nature; for he pried\nall round my little room with an extremely sagacious leer, and then\ngazed at me with a dark cock of his eye, and glanced askance at Bunny,\nand managed to wink, like the Commodore's ship beginning to light\npoop-lanterns.\n\n\"Speak out, like a man,\" I said; \"is your wife confined with a prophecy,\nor what is the matter with you?\"\n\n\"Hepzibah, the prophetess, is well; and her prophecies are abiding the\nfulness of their fulfilment. I would speak with you on a very secret and\nimportant matter, concerning also her revealings.\"\n\n\"Then I will send the child away. Here, Bunny, run and ask mother\nJones----\"\n\n\"That will not do; I will not speak here. Walls are thin, and walls have\nears. Come down to the well with me.\"\n\n\"But the well is a lump of walls,\" I answered, \"and children almost\nalways near it.\"\n\n\"There are no children. I have been down. The well is dry, and the\nchildren know it. No better place can be for speaking.\"\n\nLooking down across the churchyard, I perceived that he was right; and\nso I left Bunny to dwell on her breakfast, and went with Hezekiah. Among\nthe sandhills there was no one; for fright had fallen on everybody,\nsince the sands began to walk, as the general folk now declared of them.\nAnd nobody looked at a sandhill now with any other feeling than towards\nhis grave and tombstone.\n\nEven my heart was a little heavy, in spite of all scientific points,\nwhen I straddled over the stone that led into the sandy passage. After\nme came Hezekiah, groping with his grimy hands, and calling out for me\nto stop, until he could have hold of me. However, I left him to follow\nthe darkness, in the wake of his own ideas.\n\nA better place for secret talk, in a parish full of echoes, scarcely\ncould be found, perhaps, except the old \"Red House\" on the shore. So I\nwaited for Perkins to unfold, as soon as we stood on the bottom step,\nwith three or four yards of quicksand, but no dip for a pitcher below\nus. The children knew that the well was dry, and some of them perhaps\nwere gone to try to learn their letters.\n\nWhat then was my disappointment, as it gradually came out, that so far\nfrom telling me a secret, Hezekiah's object was to deprive me of my own!\nHowever, if I say what happened, nobody can grumble.\n\nIn the first place, he man\u00c5\u0093uvred much to get the weather-gage of me, by\nsetting me so that the light that slanted down the grey slope should\ngather itself upon my honest countenance. I for my part, as a man\nunwarned how far it might become a duty to avoid excess of accuracy,\ntook the liberty to prefer a less conspicuous position; not that I had\nany lies to tell, but might be glad to hear some. Therefore, I stuck to\na pleasant seat upon a very nice sandy slab, where the light so shot and\nwavered, that a badly inquisitive man might seek in vain for a flush or\na flickering of the most delicate light of all--that which is cast by\nthe heart or mind of man into the face of man.\n\nUpon the whole, it could scarcely be said, at least as concerned\nHezekiah, that truth was to be found, just now, at the bottom of this\nwell.\n\n\"Dear brother Dyo,\" he gently began, with the most brotherly voice and\nmanner; \"it has pleased the Lord, who does all things aright, to send me\nto you for counsel now, as well as for comfort, beloved Dyo.\"\n\n\"All that I have is at your service,\" I answered very heartily; looking\nfor something about his wife, and always enjoying a thing of that kind\namong those righteous fellows; and we heard that Hepzibah had taken up,\nunder word of the Lord, with the Shakers.[B]\n\n\"Brother David, I have wrestled hard in the night-season, about that\nwhich has come to pass. My wife----\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" I said.\n\n\"My wife, who was certified seven times as a vessel for the Spirit----\"\n\n\"To be sure--they always are; and then they gad about so----\"\n\n\"Brother, you understand me not; or desire to think evil. Hepzibah,\nsince her last confinement, is a vessel for the Spirit to the square of\nwhat she was. Seven times seven is forty-nine, and requires no\ncertificate. But these are carnal calculations.\"\n\nAll this took me beyond my depth, and I answered him rather crustily;\nand my word ended with both those letters which, as I learned from my\nCatechism, belong to us by baptism.\n\n\"Unholy David, shun evil words. Pray without ceasing, but swear not at\nall. In a vision of the night, Hepzibah hath seen terrible things of\nthee.\"\n\n\"Why, you never went home last night, Hezekiah. How can you tell what\nyour wife dreamed?\"\n\n\"I said not when it came to pass. And how could I speak of it yesterday\nbefore that loose assembly?\"\n\n\"Well, well, out with it! What was this wonderful vision?\"\n\n\"Hepzibah, the prophetess, being in a trance, and deeply inspired of\nthe Lord, beheld the following vision: A long lonely sea was spread\nbefore her, shining in the moonlight smoothly, and in places strewed\nwith gold. A man was standing on a low black rock, casting a line, and\ndrawing great fish out almost every time he cast. Then there arose from\nout the water a dear little child all dressed in white, carrying with\nboth hands her cradle, and just like our little maiden, Martha----\"\n\n\"Like your dirty Martha indeed!\" I was at the very point of saying, but\nsnapped my lips, and saved myself.\n\n\"This small damsel approached the fisherman, and presented her cradle to\nhim, with a very trustful smile. Then he said, 'Is it gold?' And she\nsaid, 'No, it is only a white lily.' Upon which he shouted, 'Be off with\nyou!' And the child fell into a desolate hole, and groped about vainly\nfor her cradle. Then all the light faded out of the sea, and the waves\nand the rocks began moaning, and the fisherman fell on his knees, and\nsought in vain for the cradle. And while he was moaning, came Satan\nhimself, bearing the cradle red-hot and crackling; and he seized the\npoor man by his blue woollen smock, and laid him in the cradle, and\nrocked it, till his shrieks awoke Hepzibah. And Hepzibah is certain that\nyou are the man.\"\n\nTo hear all this in that sudden manner quite took my breath away for a\nminute, so that I fell back and knocked my head, purely innocent as I\nwas. But presently I began to hope that the prophetess might be wrong\nthis time; and the more so because that vile trance of hers might have\ncome from excessive enjoyment of those good fish of mine. And it grew\nupon me more and more, the more I disliked her prediction about me, that\nif she had such inspiration, scarcely would she have sent Hezekiah to\nbuy her supper from my four-legged table. Therefore I spoke without much\nloss of courage.\n\n\"Brother Hezekiah, there is something wrong with Hepzibah. Send her, I\npray you, to Dr Ap-Yollup before she prophesies anything more. No blue\nwoollen smock have I worn this summer, but a canvas jacket only, and\nmore often a striped jersey. It is Sandy Macraw she has seen in her\ndream, with the devil both roasting and rocking him. Glory be to the\nLord for it!\"\n\n\"Glory be to Him, Dyo, whichever of you two it was! I hope that it may\nhave been Sandy. But Hepzibah is always accurate, even among fishermen.\"\n\n\"Even fishermen,\" I answered (being a little touched with wrath), \"know\nthe folk that understood them, and the folk that cannot. Even fishermen\nhave their right, especially when reduced to it, not to be blasphemed in\nthat way, even by a prophetess.\"\n\n\"Dyo, you are hot again. What makes you go on so? A friend's advice is\nsuch a thing, that I nearly always take it; unless I find big obstacles.\nDyo, now be advised by me.\"\n\n\"That depends on how I like it,\" was the best thing I could say.\n\n\"David Llewellyn, the only chance to save thy sinful soul is this. Open\nthine heart to the chosen one, to the favoured of the Lord. Confess to\nHepzibah the things that befell thee, and how the tempter prevailed with\nthee. Especially bring forth, my brother, the accursed thing thou hast\nhid in thy tent, the wedge of gold, and the shekels of silver, and the\nBabylonish garment. Thou hast stolen, and dissembled also; and put it\neven among thine own stuff. Cast it from thee, deliver it up, lay it\nbefore the ark of the Lord, and Hepzibah shall fall down and pray, lest\nthou be consumed and burnt with fire, like the son of Carmi the son of\nZabdi, and covered over with a great heap of stones, even such as this\nis.\"\n\nMy wrath at this foul accusation, and daring attempt to frighten me, was\nkindled so that I could not speak; and if this had happened in the open\nair, I should have been certain to knock him down. However, I began to\nthink, for Perkins was a litigious fellow; and however strict a man's\nconduct is, he does not want his affairs all exposed. Therefore I kept\nmy knit knuckles at home, but justly felt strong indignation. Perkins\nthought he had terrified me, for perhaps in that bad light I looked\npale; and so he began to triumph upon me, which needs, as everybody\nknows, a better man than Hezekiah.\n\n\"Come, come, brother Dyo,\" he said, in a voice quite different from the\nChapel-Scriptural style he had used; \"you see, we know all about it. Two\ndear children come ashore, one dead, and the other not dead. You\ncontrive to receive them both, with your accustomed poaching skill. For\neverybody says that you are always to be found everywhere, except in\nyour chapel, on Sabbath-day. Now, David, what do our good people, having\nfamilies of their own, find upon these children? Not so much as a chain,\nor locket, or even a gold pin. I am a jeweller, and I know that children\nof high position always have some trinket on them, when their mothers\nlove them. A child with a coronet, and no gold! David, this is wrong of\nwrong. And worse than this, you conceal the truth, even from me your\nancient friend. There must be a great deal to be made, either from those\nwho would hold them in trust, or from those in whose way they stood. For\nthe family died out, very likely, in all male inheritance. Think what we\nmight make of it, by acting under my direction. And you shall have half\nof it all, old Davy, by relieving your mind, and behaving in a sensible\nand religious manner.\"\n\nThis came home to my sense of experience more than all Hepzibah's divine\npredictions or productions. At the same time I saw that Hezekiah was all\nabroad in the dark, and groping right and left after the bodily truth.\nAnd what call had he to cry shares with me, because he had more\nreputation, and a higher conceit of himself, of course? But it crossed\nmy mind that this nasty fellow, being perhaps in front of me in some\nlittle tricks of machinery, might be useful afterwards in getting at the\nreal truth, which often kept me awake at night. Only I was quite\nresolved not to encourage roguery, by letting him into partnership.\nPerceiving my depth of consideration--for it suited my purpose to hear\nhim out, and learn how much he suspected--it was natural that he should\ntry again to impress me yet further by boasting.\n\n\"Dyo, I have been at a Latin school for as much as three months\ntogether. My father gave me a rare education, and I made the most of it.\nNone of your ignorance for me! I am up to the moods and the tenses, the\naccidents and the proselytes. The present I know, and the future I know;\nthe Peter-perfection, and the hay-roost----\"\n\n\"I call that stuff gibberish. Talk plain English if you can.\"\n\n\"Understand you then so much as this? I speak in a carnal manner now. I\nspeak as a fool unto a fool. I am up to snuff, good Dyo; I can tell the\ntime of day.\"\n\n\"Then you are a devilish deal cleverer than any of your clocks are. But\nnow thou speakest no parables, brother. Now I know what thou meanest.\nThou art up for robbing somebody; and if I would shun Satan's clutches,\nI must come and help thee.\"\n\n\"Dyo, this is inconsistent, nor can I call it brotherly. We wish to do\ngood, both you and I, and to raise a little money for works of love;\nyou, no doubt, with a good end in view, to console you for much\ntribulation; and I with a single eye to the advancement of the cause\nwhich I have at heart, to save many brands from the burning. Then, Dyo,\nwhy not act together? Why not help one another, dear brother; thou with\nthe good-luck, and I with the brains?\"\n\nHe laid his hand on my shoulder kindly, with a yearning of his bowels\ntowards me, such as true Nonconformists feel at the scent of any money.\nI found myself also a little moved, not being certain how far it was\nwise to throw him altogether over.\n\nBut suddenly, by what means I know not, except the will of Providence,\nthere arose before me that foul wrong which the Nicodemus-Christian had\ncommitted against me some three years back. I had forborne to speak of\nit till now, wishing to give the man fair-play.\n\n\"Hezekiah, do you remember,\" I asked, with much solemnity \"do you\nremember your twentieth wedding-day?\"\n\n\"Davy, my brother, how many times--never mind talking about that now.\"\n\n\"You had a large company coming, and to whom did you give a special\norder to catch you a turbot at tenpence a-pound?\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, my dear friend Dyo; shall I never get that thing out of your\nstupid head?\"\n\n\"You had known me for twenty years at least as the very best fisherman\non the coast, and a man that could be relied upon. Yet you must go and\ngive that order, not to a man of good Welsh blood--with ten Welshmen\ncoming to dinner, mind--not to a man that was bred and born within five\nmiles of your dirty house--not to a man that knew every cranny and\ncrinkle of sand where the turbots lie; but to a tag-rag Scotchman! It\nwas spoken of upon every pebble from Briton Ferry to Aberthaw. David\nLlewellyn put under the feet of a fellow like Sandy Macraw--a beggarly,\ninterloping, freckled, bitter weed of a Scotchman!\"\n\n\"Well, Davy, I have apologised. How many times more must I do it? It was\nnot that I doubted your skill. You tell us of that so often, that none\nof us ever question it. It was simply because--I feared just then to\ncome near your excellent and lamented----\"\n\n\"No excuses, no excuses, Mr Perkins, if you please! You only make the\nmatter worse. As if a man's wife could come into the question, when it\ncomes to business! Yours may, because you don't know how to manage her;\nbut mine----\"\n\n\"Well, now she is gone, Dyo; and very good she was to you, And in your\nheart, you know it.\"\n\nWhether he said this roguishly, or from the feeling which all of us have\nwhen it comes to one another, I declare I knew not then, and I know not\neven now. For I did not feel so sharply up to look to mine own interest,\nwith these recollections over me. I waited for him to begin again, but\nhe seemed to stick back in the corner. And in spite of all that turbot\nbusiness, at the moment I could not help holding out my hand to him.\n\nHe took it, and shook it, with as much emotion as if he had truly been\nfond of my wife; and I felt that nothing more must be said concerning\nthat order to Sandy Macraw. It seemed to be very good reason also, for\ngetting out of that interview; for I might say things to be sorry for,\nif I allowed myself to go on any more with my heart so open. Therefore I\ncalled in my usual briskness, \"Lo, the water is rising! The children\nmust be at the mouth of the well. What will the good wife prophesy if\nshe sees thee coming up the stairs with thy two feet soaking wet, Master\nHezekiah?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nFOR A LITTLE CHANGE OF AIR.\n\n\nOn the very next day, I received such a visit as never had come to my\nhouse before. For while I was trimming my hooks, and wondering how to\nget out of all this trouble with my conscience sound and my pocket\nimproved; suddenly I heard a voice not to be found anywhere.\n\n\"I 'ants to yalk, I tell 'a, Yatkin. Put me down derekkerly. I 'ants to\nsee old Davy.\"\n\n\"And old Davy wants to see you, you beauty,\" I cried, as she jumped like\na little wild kid, and took all my house with a glance, and then me.\n\n\"Does 'a know, I yikes this house, and I yikes 'a, and I yikes Yatkin,\nand ickle Bunny, and evelybody?\"\n\nShe pointed all round for everybody, with all ten fingers spread\neveryway. Then Watkin came after her, like her slave, with a foolish\ngrin on his countenance, in spite of the undertaking business.\n\n\"If you please, sir, Mr Llewellyn,\" he said, \"we was forced to bring her\nover; she have been crying so dreadful, and shivering about the black\npit-hole so. And when the black things came into the house, she was\ngoing clean out of her little mind, ever so many times almost. No use\nit was at all to tell her ever so much a-yard they was. 'I don't yike\nback, and I 'on't have back. Yite I yikes, and boo I yikes; and my dear\npapa be so very angy, when I tells him all about it.' She went on like\nthat, and she did so cry, mother said she must change the air a bit.\"\n\nAll the time he was telling me this, she watched him with her head on\none side and her lips kept ready in the most comic manner, as much as to\nsay, \"Now you tell any stories at my expense, and you may look out.\" But\nWatkin was truth itself, and she nodded, and said \"Ness,\" at the end of\nhis speech.\n\n\"And, if you please, sir, Mr Llewellyn, whatever is a 'belung,' sir? All\nthe way she have been asking for 'belung, belung, belung.' And I cannot\ntell for the life of me whatever is 'belung.'\"\n\n\"Boy, never ask what is unbecoming,\" I replied, in a manner which made\nhim blush, according to my intention. For the word might be English for\nall I knew, and have something of high life in it. However, I found,\nby-and-by, that it meant what she was able to call \"Ummibella,\" when\npromoted a year in the dictionary.\n\nBut now anybody should only have seen her, who wanted a little rousing\nup. My cottage, of course, is not much to boast of, compared with\ncastles, and so on; nevertheless there is something about it pleasant\nand good, like its owner. You might see ever so many houses, and think\nthem larger, and grander, and so on, with more opportunity for sitting\ndown, and less for knocking your head perhaps; and after all you would\ncome back to mine. Not for the sake of the meat in the cupboard--because\nI seldom had any, and far inferior men had more; but because--well, it\ndoes not matter. I never could make you understand, unless you came to\nsee it.\n\nOnly I felt that I had found a wonderful creature to make me out, and\nenter almost into my own views (of which the world is not capable) every\ntime I took this child up and down the staircase. She would have jumps,\nand she made me talk in a manner that quite surprised myself; and such a\nfine feeling grew up between us, that it was a happy thing for the whole\nof us, not to have Bunny in the way just then. Mother Jones was giving\nher apple-party; as she always did when the red streaks came upon her\n\"Early Margarets.\" But I always think the White Juneating is a far\nsuperior apple: and I have a tree of it. My little garden is nothing\ngrand, any more than the rest of my premises, or even myself, if it\ncomes to that; still you might go for a long day's walk, and find very\nfew indeed to beat it, unless you were contradictory. For ten doors at\nleast, both west and east, this was admitted silently; as was proved by\ntheir sending to me for a cabbage, an artichoke, or an onion, or\nanything choice for a Sunday dinner. It may suit these very people now\nto shake their heads and to run me down, but they should not forget what\nI did for them, when it comes to pronouncing fair judgment.\n\nPoor Bardie appeared as full of bright spirit, and as brave as ever, and\nwhen she tumbled from jumping two steps, what did she do but climb back\nand jump three, which even Bunny was afraid to do. But I soon perceived\nthat this was only a sort of a flash in the pan, as it were. The happy\nchange from the gloom of Sker House, from the silent corners and\ncreaking stairs, and long-faced people keeping watch, and howling every\nnow and then--also the sight of me again (whom she looked upon as her\nchief protector), and the general air of tidiness belonging to my\ndwelling--these things called forth all at once the play and joyful\nspring of her nature. But when she began to get tired of this, and to\nlong for a little coaxing, even the stupidest gaffer could see that she\nwas not the child she had been. Her little face seemed pinched and pale,\nand prematurely grave and odd; while in the grey eyes tears shone ready\nat any echo of thought to fall. Also her forehead, broad and white,\nwhich marked her so from common children, looked as if too much of\npuzzling and of wondering had been done there. Even the gloss of her\nrich brown poll was faded, with none to care for it; while the dainty\nfeet and hands, so sensitive as to a speck of dirt, were enough to bring\nthe tears of pity into a careful mother's eyes.\n\n\"Gardy la! 'Ook 'e see, 'hot degustin' naily pailies! And poor Bardie\nnuffin to kean 'em with!\"\n\nWhile I was setting this grief to rest (for which she kissed me\nbeautifully), many thoughts came through my mind about this little\ncreature. She and I were of one accord, upon so many important points;\nand when she differed from me, perhaps she was in the right almost:\nwhich is a thing that I never knew happen in a whole village of grown-up\npeople. And by the time I had brushed her hair and tied up the bows of\nher frock afresh, and when she began to dance again, and to play every\nkind of trick with me, I said to myself, \"I must have this child.\nWhatever may come of it, I will risk--when the price of butcher's-meat\ncomes down.\"\n\nThis I said in real earnest; but the price of butcher's-meat went up,\nand I never have known it come down again.\n\nWhile I was thinking, our Bunny came in, full of apples, raw and\nroasted, and of the things the children said. But at the very first\nsight of Bardie, everything else was gone from her. All the other\nchildren were fit only to make dirt-pies of. This confirmed and held me\nsteadfast in the opinions which I had formed without any female\nassistance.\n\nIn spite of all her own concerns (of which she was full enough, goodness\nknows), Bunny came up, and pulled at her, by reason of something down\nher back, which wanted putting to rights a little--a plait, or a tuck,\nor some manner of gear; only I thought it a clever thing, and the little\none approved of it. And then, our Bunny being in her best, these\nchildren took notice of one another, to settle which of them was nearer\nto the proper style of clothes. And each admired the other for anything\nwhich she had not got herself.\n\n\"Come, you baby-chits,\" said I, being pleased at their womanly ways, so\nearly; \"all of us want some food, I think. Can we eat our dresses?\" The\nchildren, of course, understood me not; nevertheless, what I said was\nsense.\n\nAnd if, to satisfy womankind--for which I have deepest regard and\nrespect--I am forced to enter into questions higher than reason of men\ncan climb--of washing, and ironing, and quilling, and gaufreing, and\nsetting up, and styles of transparent reefing, and all our other\nendeavours to fetch this child up to her station--the best thing I can\ndo will be to have mother Jones in to write it for me; if only she can\nbe forced to spell.\n\nHowever, that is beyond all hope; and even I find it hard sometimes to\nbe sure of the royal manner. Only I go by the Bible always, for every\nword that I can find; being taught (ever since I could read at all) that\nhis Majesty, James I., confirmed it.\n\nNow this is not all the thing which I wanted to put before you clearly;\nbecause I grow like a tombstone often, only fit to make you laugh, when\nI stand on my right to be serious. My great desire is to tell you what I\ndid, and how I did it, as to the managing of these children, even for a\nday or two, so as to keep them from crying, or scorching, or spoiling\ntheir clothes, or getting wet, or having too much victuals or too\nlittle. Of course I consulted that good mother Jones five or six times\nevery day; and she never was weary of giving advice, though she said\nevery time that it must be the last. And a lucky thing it was for me in\nall this responsibility to have turned enough of money, through skilful\ncatch and sale of fish, to allow of my staying at home a little, and not\nonly washing and mending of clothes, but treating the whole of the\nhousehold to the delicacies of the season. However, it is not my habit\nto think myself anything wonderful; that I leave to the rest of the\nworld: and no doubt any good and clever man might have done a great part\nof what I did. Only if anything should befall us, out of the reach of a\nsailor's skill and the depth of Bunny's experience, mother Jones\npromised to come straight in, the very moment I knocked at the wall; and\nher husband slept with such musical sound that none could be lonely in\nany house near, and so did all of her ten children who could crack a\nlollipop.\n\nUpon the whole, we passed so smoothly over the first evening, with the\ntwo children as hard at play as if they were paid fifty pounds for it,\nthat having some twenty-five shillings in hand after payment of all\ncreditors, and only ten weeks to my pension-day, with my boat unknown to\nanybody, and a very good prospect of fish running up from the Mumbles at\nthe next full moon, I set the little one on my lap, after a good bout of\nlaughing at her very queer ins and outs--for all things seem to be all\nalive with, as well as to, her.\n\n\"Will you stay with me, my dear?\" I said, as bold as King George and the\nDragon; \"would you like to live with old Davy and Bunny, and have ever\nso many frocks washed, soon as ever he can buy them?\" For nothing\nsatisfied her better than to see her one gown washed. She laid her head\non one side a little, so that I felt it hot to my bosom, being excused\nof my waistcoat; and I knew that she had overworked herself.\n\n\"Ness,\" she said, after thinking a bit. \"Ness, I live with 'a, old Davy,\ntill my dear mama come for me. Does 'e know, old Davy, 'hot I thinks?\"\n\n\"No, my pretty; I only know that you are always thinking.\" And so she\nwas; no doubt of it.\n\n\"I tell 'a, old Davy, 'hot I thinks. No--I can't tell 'a; only sompfin.\n'Et me go for more pay with Bunny.\"\n\n\"No, my dear, just stop a minute. Bunny has got no breath left in her;\nshe is such a great fat Bunny. What you mean to say is, that you don't\nknow how papa and mama could ever think of leaving you such a long, long\ntime away.\"\n\nShe shook her curly pate as if each frizzle were a puzzle; and her sweet\nwhite forehead seemed a mainsail full of memory; and then gay presence\nwas in her eyes, and all the play which I had stopped broke upon her\nmind again.\n\n\"Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor,\" she began, with her beautiful fingers\ncrawling, like white carnelian compasses, up the well-made buttons of my\nnew smock-guernsey; for though I had begged my hot waistcoat off, I\nnever was lax of dress in her presence as I would be in Bunny's--or, in\nshort, with anybody except this little lady. I myself taught her that\n\"tinker, tailor,\" and had a right to have it done to me. And she\nfinished it off with such emphasis upon button No. 7, which happened to\nbe the last of them, \"gentleman, ploughboy, fief,\" looking straight into\nmy eyes, and both of us laughing at the fine idea that I could possibly\nbe called a thief! But fearing to grow perhaps foolish about her, as she\ndid these charming things to me, I carried her up to bed with Bunny, and\nsung them both away to sleep with a melancholy dirge of sea.\n\nInto whatever state of life it may please God to call me--though I fear\nthere cannot be many more at this age of writing--it always will be, as\nit always has been, my first principle and practice to do my very utmost\n(which is far less than it was, since the doctor stopped my hornpipes)\nto be pleasant and good company. And it is this leading motive which has\nkept me from describing--as I might have done, to make you tingle and be\nangry afterwards--the state of Sker House, and of Evan Thomas, and Moxy\nhis wife, and all their friends, about those five poor rabbiters. Also\nother darkish matters, such as the plight of those obstinate black men\nwhen they came ashore at last, three together, and sometimes four, as if\nthey had fought in the water. And, after all, what luck they had in\nobtaining proper obsequies, inasmuch as, by order of Crowner Bowles, a\ngreat hole in the sand was dug in a little sheltered valley, and kept\nopen till it was fairly thought that the sea must have finished with\nthem; and then, after being carefully searched for anything of value,\nthey were rolled in all together and kept down with stones, like the\nparish mangle, and covered with a handsome mound of sand. And not only\nthis, but in spite of expense and the murmuring of the vestry, a board\nwell tarred (to show their colour) was set up in the midst of it, and\ntheir number \"35\" chalked up; and so they were stopped of their mischief\nawhile, after shamefully robbing their poor importer.\n\nBut if this was conducted handsomely, how much more so were the\nfunerals of the five young white men! The sense of the neighbourhood,\nand the stir, and the presence of the Coroner (who stopped a whole week\nfor sea air and freshness, after seeing so many good things come in, and\nperceiving so many ways home that night, that he made up his mind to\nnone of them); also the feeling (which no one expressed, but all would\nhave been disappointed of) that honest black Evan, after knocking so\nmany men down in both parishes and the extra-parochial manor, was\ndesigned, by this downright blow from above, to repent and to entertain\nevery one; and most of all, the fact that five of a highly respectable\nfamily were to be buried at once, to the saving of four future funerals,\nall of which must have been fine ones,--these universal sympathies\ncompelled the house and the people therein to exert themselves to the\nuttermost.\n\nEnough that it gave satisfaction, not universal, but general; and even\nthat last is a hard thing to do in such great outbursts of sympathy.\nThough Moudlin church is more handy for Sker, and the noble Portreeve of\nKenfig stood upon his right to it, still there were stronger reasons why\nold Newton should have the preference. And Sker being outside either\nparish, Crowner Bowles, on receipt of a guinea, swore down the Portreeve\nto his very vamps. For Moxy Thomas was a Newton woman, and loved every\nscrape of a shoe there; and her uncle, the clerk, would have ended his\ndays if the fees had gone over to Kenfig. Our parson, as well, was a\nvery fine man, and a match for the whole of the service; while the\nlittle fellow at Moudlin always coughed at a word of three syllables.\n\nThere was one woman in our village who was always right. She had been\ndisappointed, three times over, in her early and middle days; and the\neffect of this on her character was so lasting and so wholesome, that\nshe never spoke without knowing something. When from this capital female\nI heard that our churchyard had won the victory, and when I foresaw the\ndemented condition of glory impending upon our village (not only from\nfive magnificent palls, each with its proper attendance of black, and\neach with fine hymns and good howling, but yet more than that from the\nhot strength of triumph achieved over vaunting Kenfig), then it came\ninto my mind to steal away with Bardie.\n\nA stern and sad sacrifice of myself, I assured myself that it was, and\nwould be; for few even of our oldest men could enjoy a funeral more than\nI did, with its sad reflections and junketings. And I might have been\nhead-man of all that day, entitled not only to drop the mould, but to\nmake the speech afterwards at the Inn.\n\nBut I abandoned all these rights, and braved once more the opinions of\nneighbours (which any man may do once too often); and when the advance\nof sound came towards us, borne upon the western wind from the end of\nNewton Wayn, slowly hanging through the air, as if the air loved death\nof man--the solemn singing of the people who must go that way\nthemselves, and told it in their melody; and when the Clevice rock rung\nsoftly with the tolling bell, as well as with the rolling dirges, we\nslipped away at the back of it--that is to say, pretty Bardie and I. For\nBunny was purer of Newton birth than to leave such a sight without\ntearing away. And desiring some little to hear all about it, I left her\nwith three very good young women, smelling strongly of southernwood, who\nwere beginning to weep already, and promised to tell me the whole of it.\n\nAs we left this dismal business, Bardie danced along beside me, like an\nostrich-feather blown at. In among the sandhills soon I got her, where\nshe could see nothing, and the thatch of rushes deadened every pulse of\nthe funeral bell. And then a strange idea took me, all things being\nstrange just now, that it might prove a rich wise thing to go for a\nquiet cruise with Bardie. In that boat, and on the waves, she might\nremember things recovered by the chance of semblance. Therefore, knowing\nthat all living creatures five miles either way of us were sure to be in\nNewton churchyard nearly all the afternoon, and then in the\npublic-houses, I scrupled not to launch my boat and go to sea with the\nlittle one. For if we steered a proper course no funeral could see us.\nAnd so I shipped her gingerly. The glory of her mind was such that\noverboard she must have jumped, except for my Sunday neck-tie with a\nhalf-hitch knot around her. And the more I rowed the more she laughed,\nand looked at the sun with her eyes screwed up, and at the water with\nall wide open. \"'Hare is 'a going, old Davy?\" she said, slipping from\nunder my Sunday splice, and coming to me wonderfully, and laying her\ntiny hands on mine, which beat me always, as she had found out; \"is 'a\ngoing to my dear papa, and mama, and ickle bother?\"\n\n\"No, my pretty, you must wait for them to come. We are going to catch\nsome fish, and salt them, that they may keep with a very fine smell,\ntill your dear papa brings your mama and all the family with him; and\nthen what a supper we will have!\"\n\n\"'Ill 'a,\" she said; \"and poor Bardie too?\"\n\nBut the distance of the supper-time was a very sad disappointment to\nher, and her bright eyes filled with haze. And then she said \"Ness\" very\nquietly, because she was growing to understand that she could not have\nher own way now. I lay on my oars and watched her carefully, while she\nwas shaking her head and wondering, with her little white shoulders\nabove the thwart, and her innocent and intelligent eyes full of the\nspreading sky and sea. It was not often one had the chance, through the\never-flitting change, to learn the calm and true expression of that poor\nyoung creature's face. Even now I could not tell, except that her\nplayful eyes were lonely, and her tender lips were trembling, and a\nheartful of simple love could find no outlet, and lost itself. These\nlittle things, when thinking thus, or having thought flow through them,\nnever ought to be disturbed, because their brains are tender. The\nunknown stream will soon run out, and then they are fit again for play,\nwhich is the proper work of man. We open the world, and we close the\nworld, with nothing more than this; and while our manhood is too grand\n(for a score and a half of years, perhaps), to take things but in\nearnest, the justice of our birth is on us,--we are fortune's plaything.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nPUBLIC APPROBATION.\n\n\nIf that child had no luck herself (except, of course, in meeting me), at\nany rate she never failed to bring me wondrous fortune. The air was\nsmooth, and sweet, and soft, the sky had not a wrinkle, and the fickle\nsea was smiling, proud of pleasant manners. Directly I began to fish at\nthe western tail of the Tuskar, scarcely a fish forebore me.\nWhiting-pollacks run in shoals, and a shoal I had of them; and the way I\nsplit and dried them made us long for breakfast-time. And Bardie did\nenjoy them so.\n\nThe more I dwelled with that little child, the more I grew wrapped up in\nher. Her nature was so odd and loving, and her ways so pretty. Many men\nforego their goodness, so that they forget the nature of a little\ndarling child. Otherwise, perhaps, we might not, if we kept our hearts\naright, so despise the days of loving, and the time of holiness. Now\nthis baby almost shamed me, and I might say Bunny too, when, having\nundressed her, and put the coarse rough night-gown on her, which came\nfrom Sker with the funerals, my grandchild called me from up-stairs, to\nmeet some great emergency.\n\n\"Granny, come up with the stick dreckly moment, granny dear! Missy 'ont\ngo into bed. Such a bad wicked child she is.\"\n\nI ran up-stairs, and there was Bunny all on fire with noble wrath, and\nthere stood Bardie sadly scraping the worm-eaten floor with her small\nwhite toes.\n\n\"I'se not a yicked shild,\" she said, \"I'se a yae good gal, I is; I 'ont\ngo to bed till I say my payers to 'Mighty God, as my dear mama make me.\nShe be very angy with 'a, Bunny, 'hen she knows it.\"\n\nHereupon I gave Bunny a nice little smack, and had a great mind to let\nher taste the stick which she had invoked so eagerly. However, she\nroared enough without it, because her feelings were deeply hurt. Bardie\nalso cried for company, or, perhaps, at my serious aspect, until I put\nher down on her knees and bade her say her prayers, and have done with\nit. At the same time it struck me how stupid I was not to have asked\nabout this before, inasmuch as even a child's religion may reveal some\nof its history.\n\nShe knelt as prettily as could be, with her head thrown back, and her\ntiny palms laid together upon her breast, and thus she said her simple\nprayer.\n\n\"Pay God bless dear papa, and mama, and ickle bother. Gentle Jesus, meek\nand mild, 'ook upon a ickle shild, and make me a good gal. Amen.\"\n\nThen she got up and kissed poor Bunny, and was put into bed as good as\ngold, and slept like a little dormouse till morning.\n\nTake it altogether now, we had a happy time of it. Every woman in Newton\npraised me for my kindness to the child; and even the men who had too\nmany could not stand against Bardie's smile. They made up, indeed, some\nscandalous story, as might have been expected, about my relationship to\nthe baby, and her sudden appearance so shortly after my poor wife's\ndeath. However, by knocking three men down, I produced a more active\ngrowth of charity in our neighbourhood.\n\nAnd very soon a thing came to pass, such as I never could have\nexpected, and of a nature to lift me (even more than the free use of my\npole) for a period of at least six months, above the reach of libel,\nfrom any one below the rank of a justice of the peace. This happened\njust as follows:--One night the children were snug in bed, and finding\nthe evenings long, because the days were shortening in so fast--which\nseemed to astonish everybody--it came into my head to go no more than\noutside my own door, and into the \"Jolly Sailors.\" For the autumn seemed\nto be coming on, and I like to express my opinions upon that point in\nsociety; never being sure where I may be before ever another autumn.\nMoreover, the landlord was not a man to be neglected with impunity. He\nnever liked his customers to stay too long away from him, any more than\nour parson did; and pleasant as he was when pleased, and generous in the\nway of credit to people with any furniture, nothing was more sure to vex\nhim, than for a man without excuse, to pretend to get on without him.\n\nNow when I came into the room, where our little sober proceedings are--a\nnarrow room, and dark enough, yet full of much good feeling, also with\nhard wooden chairs worn soft by generations of sitting--a sudden stir\narose among the excellent people present. They turned and looked at me,\nas if they had never enjoyed that privilege, or, at any rate, had failed\nto make proper use of it before. And ere my modesty was certain whether\nthis were for good or harm, they raised such a clapping with hands and\nfeet, and a clinking of glasses in a line with it, that I felt myself\nworthy of some great renown. I stood there and bowed, and made my best\nleg, and took off my hat in acknowledgment. Observing this, they were\nall delighted, as if I had done them a real honour; and up they arose\nwith one accord, and gave me three cheers, with an Englishman setting\nthe proper tune for it.\n\nI found myself so overcome all at once with my own fame and celebrity,\nthat I called for a glass of hot rum-and-water, with the nipple of a\nlemon in it, and sugar the size of a nutmeg. My order was taken with a\nspeed and deference hitherto quite unknown to me; and better than that,\nseven men opened purses, and challenged the right to pay for it.\nEntering into so rare a chance of getting on quite gratis, and knowing\nthat such views are quick to depart, I called for six oz. of tobacco,\nwith the Bristol stamp (a red crown) upon it. Scarce had I tested the\ndraught of a pipe--which I had to do sometimes for half an hour, with\nall to blow out, and no drawing in--when the tobacco was at my elbow,\nserved with a saucer, and a curtsey. \"Well,\" thought I, \"this is real\nglory.\" And I longed to know how I had earned it.\n\nIt was not likely, with all those people gazing so respectfully, that I\nwould deign to ask them coarsely, what the deuce could have made them do\nit. I had always felt myself unworthy of obscure position, and had\ndreamed, for many years, of having my merits perceived at last. And to\nask the reason would have been indeed a degradation, although there was\nnot a fibre of me but quivered to know all about it. Herein, however, I\novershot the mark, as I found out afterwards; for my careless manner\nmade people say that I must have written the whole myself--a thing so\nvery far below me, that I scorn to answer it. But here it is; and then\nyou can judge from the coarse style, and the three-decked words, whether\nit be work of mine.\n\nFelix Farley's Bristol Journal, Saturday, July 24, 1782.--\"_Shipwreck\nand loss of all hands_--_Heroism of a British tar_.--We hear of a sad\ncatastrophe from the coast of Glamorganshire. The season of great heat\nand drought, from which our readers must have suffered, broke up, as\nthey may kindly remember, with an almost unprecedented gale of wind and\nthunder, on Sunday, the 11th day of this month. In the height of the\ntempest a large ship was descried, cast by the fury of the elements upon\na notorious reef of rocks, at a little place called Sker, about twenty\nmiles to the east of Swansea. Serious apprehensions were entertained by\nthe spectators for the safety of the crew, which appeared to consist of\nblack men. Their fears were too truly verified, for in less than an hour\nthe ill-fated bark succumbed to her cruel adversaries. No adult male of\neither colour appears to have reached the shore alive, although a\ncelebrated fisherman, and heroic pensioner of our royal navy, whose name\nis David Llewellyn, and who traces his lineage from the royal bard of\nthat patronymic, performed prodigies of valour, and proved himself\nutterly regardless of his own respectable and blameless life, by\nplunging repeatedly into the boiling surges, and battling with the\nraging elements, in the vain hope of extricating the sufferers from a\nwatery grave. With the modesty which appears to be, under some\ninscrutable law of nature, inseparable from courage of the highest\norder, this heroic tar desires to remain in obscurity. This we could not\nreconcile with our sense of duty; and if any lover of our black brethren\nfinds himself moved by this narration, we shall be happy to take charge\nof any remittance marked 'D. L.' It grieves us to add that none escaped\nexcept an intelligent young female, who clung to the neck of Llewellyn.\nShe states that the ship was the Andalusia, and had sailed from\nAppledore, which is, we believe, in Devonshire. The respected Coroner\nBowles held an inquest, which afforded universal satisfaction.\"\n\nDeeply surprised as I was to find how accurately, upon the whole, this\npaper had got the story of it--for not much less than half was true--it\nwas at first a puzzle to me how they could have learned so much about\nmyself, and the valiant manner in which I intended to behave, but found\nno opportunity. Until I remembered that a man, possessing a very bad\nhat, had requested the honour of introducing himself to me, in my own\nhouse, and had begged me by all means to consider myself at home, and to\nallow him to send for refreshment, which I would not hear of twice, but\ngave him what I thought up to his mark, according to manners and\nappearance. And very likely he made a mistake between my description of\nwhat I was ready, as well as desirous, to carry out, and what I bodily\ndid go through, ay, and more, to the back of it. However, I liked this\naccount very much, and resolved to encourage yet more warmly the next\nman who came to me with a bad hat. What, then, was my disgust at\nperceiving, at the very foot of that fine description, a tissue of stuff\nlike the following!\n\n\"_Another account_ [from a highly-esteemed correspondent].--The great\ninvasion of sand, which has for so many generations spread such wide\ndevastation, and occasioned such grievous loss to landowners on the\nwestern coast of Glamorganshire, made another great stride in the storm\nof Sabbath-day, July 11. A vessel of considerable burthen, named the\nAndalusia, and laden with negroes, most carefully shipped for conversion\namong the good merchants of Bristol, appears to have been swallowed up\nby the sand; and our black fellow-creatures disappeared. It is to be\nfeared, from this visitation of an ever-benign Providence, that few of\nthem had been converted, and that the burden of their sins disabled them\nfrom swimming. If one had been snatched as a brand from the burning,\ngladly would we have recorded it, and sent him forward prayerfully for\nsustenance on his way to the Lord. But the only eyewitness (whose word\nmust never be relied upon when mammon enters into the conflict), a\nworn-out but well-meaning sailor, who fattens upon the revenue of an\noverburdened country--this man ran away so fast that he saw hardly\nanything. The Lord, however, knoweth His own in the days of visitation.\nA little child came ashore alive, and a dead child bearing a coronet.\nMany people have supposed that the pusillanimous sailor aforesaid knows\nmuch more than he will tell. It is not for us to enter into that part of\nthe question. Duty, however, compels us to say, that any one desiring to\nhave a proper comprehension of this heavy but righteous judgment--for He\ndoeth all things well--cannot do better than apply to the well-known\nhorologist of Bridgend, Hezekiah Perkins, also to the royal family.\"\n\nThe above yarn may simply be described as a gallow's-rope spun by Jack\nKetch himself from all the lies of all the scoundrels he has ever\nhanged, added to all that his own vile heart can invent, with the devil\nto help him. The cold-blooded, creeping, and crawling manner in which I\nmyself was alluded to--although without the manliness even to set my\nname down--as well as the low hypocrisy of the loathsome white-livered\nsyntax of it, made me,--well, I will say no more--the filthiness reeks\nwithout my stirring, and, indeed, no honest man should touch it; only,\nif Hezekiah Perkins had chanced to sneak into the room just then, his\nwife might have prophesied shrouds and weeds.\n\nFor who else was capable of such lies, slimed with so much sanctimony,\nlike cellar slugs, or bilge-hole rats, rolling in Angelica, while all\ntheir entrails are of brimstone, such as Satan would scorn to vomit? A\nbitter pain went up my right arm, for the weakness of my heart, when\nthat miscreant gave me insult, and I never knocked him down the well.\nAnd over and over again I have found it a thorough mistake to be always\nforgiving. However, to have done with reflections which must suggest\nthemselves to any one situated like me--if, indeed, any one ever\nwas--after containing myself, on account of the people who surrounded\nme, better than could have been hoped for, I spoke, because they\nexpected it.\n\n\"Truly, my dear friends, I am thankful for your goodwill towards me.\nAlso to the unknown writer, who has certainly made too much of my poor\nunaided efforts. I did my best; it was but little: and who dreams of\nbeing praised for it? Again, I am thankful to this other writer, who has\noverlooked me altogether. For the sake of poor Sandy Macraw, we must\nthank him that he kindly forbore to make public the name.\"\n\nYou should have seen the faces of all the folk around the table when I\ngave them this surprise.\n\n\"Why,\" said one, \"we thought for sure that it was you he was meaning,\nDyo dear. And in our hearts we were angry to him, for such falsehoods\nlarge and black. Indeed and indeed, true enough it may be of a man\noutlandish such as Sandy Macraw is.\"\n\n\"Let us not hasten to judge,\" I replied; \"Sandy is brave enough, I\ndaresay, and he can take his own part well. I will not believe that he\nran away; very likely he never was there at all. If he was, he deserves\nhigh praise for taking some little care of himself. I should not have\nbeen so stiff this night, if I had only had the common-sense to follow\nhis example.\"\n\nAll our people began to rejoice; and yet they required, as all of us do,\nsomething more than strongest proof.\n\n\"What reason is to show then, Dyo, that this man of letters meant not\nyou, but Sandy Macraw, to run away so?\"\n\n\"Hopkin, read it aloud,\" I said; \"neither do I know, nor care, what the\nwriter's meaning was. Only I thought there was something spoken about\nhis Majesty's revenue. Is it I, or is it Sandy, that belongs to the\nrevenue?\"\n\nThis entirely settled it. All our people took it up, and neglected not\nto tell one another. So that in less than three days' time, my name was\nspread far and wide for the praise, and the Scotchman's for the\ncondemnation. I desired it not, as my friends well knew; but what use to\nbeat to windward, against the breath of the whole of the world?\nTherefore I was not so obstinate as to set my opinion against the rest;\nbut left it to Mr Macraw to rebut, if he could, his pusillanimity.\n\nAs for Hezekiah Perkins, all his low creations fell upon the head from\nwhich they sprang. I spoke to our rector about his endeavour to harm a\nrespectable Newton man--for you might call Macraw that by comparison,\nthough he lived at Porthcawl, and was not respectable--and everybody was\nstruck with my kindness in using such handsome terms of a rival. The\nresult was that Perkins lost our church-clock, which paid him as well as\na many two others, having been presented to the parish, and therefore\nnot likely to go without pushing. For our rector was a peppery man,\nexcept when in the pulpit, and what he said to Hezekiah was exactly\nthis.\n\n\"What, Perkins! another great bill again! 'To repair of church-clock,\nseven-and-sixpence; to ten miles' travelling, at threepence per\nmile,'--and so on, and so on! Why, you never came further than my\nbrother the Colonel's, the last three times you have charged for. Allow\nme to ask you a little question: to whom did you go for the keys of the\nchurch?\"\n\n\"As if I should want any keys of the church! There is no church-lock in\nthe county that I cannot open, as soon as whistle.\"\n\n\"Indeed! So you pick our lock. Do you ever open a church-door honestly,\nfor the purpose of worshipping the Lord? I have kept my eye upon you,\nsir, because I hear that you have been reviling my parishioners. And I\nhappen to know that you never either opened the lock of our church or\npicked it, for the last three times you have charged for. But one thing\nyou have picked for many years, and that is the pocket of my ratepayers.\nBe off, sir--be off with your trumpery bill! We will have a good\nchurchman to do our clock--a thoroughly honest seaman, and a regular\nchurch-goer.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that big thief, Davy Llewellyn? Well, well, do as you\nplease. But I will thank you to pay my bill first.\"\n\n\"Thank me when you get it, sir. You may fall down on your canting knees,\nand thank the Lord for one thing.\"\n\n\"What am I to thank the Lord for? For allowing you to cheat me thus?\"\n\n\"For giving me self-command enough not to knock you down, sir.\" With\nthat the rector came so nigh him, that brother Perkins withdrew in\nhaste; for the parson had done that sort of thing to people who ill-used\nhim; and the sense of the parish was always with him. Hence the\nmanagement of the church-clock passed entirely into my hands, and I kept\nit almost always going, at less than half Hezekiah's price; and this\nreunited me to the Church (from which my poor wife perhaps had led me\nastray some little), by a monthly arrangement which reflected equal\ncredit on either party.\n\nAnd even this was not the whole of the blessings that now rolled down\nupon me, for the sake, no doubt, of little Bardie, as with the ark in\nthe Bible. For this fine Felix Farley was the only great author of news\nat that time prevalent among us. It is true that there was another\njournal nearer to us, at Hereford, and a highly good one, but for a very\nclear reason it failed to have command of the public-houses. For the\ncustomers liked both their pipes and their papers to be of the same\norigin, and go together kindly. And Hereford sent out no tobacco; while\nBristol was more famous for the best Virginian birdseye, than even for\nrum, or intelligence.\n\nTherefore, as everybody gifted with the gift of reading came to the\npublic-houses gradually, and to compare interpretation over those two\nnarratives, both of which stirred our county up, my humble name was in\ntheir mouths as freely and approvingly as the sealing-wax end of their\npipe stems. Unanimous consent accrued (when all had said the same thing\nover, fifty times in different manners, and with fine-drawn argument)\nthat after all, and upon the whole, David Llewellyn was an honour to\ncounty and to country.\n\nAfter that, for at least a fortnight, no more dogs were set at me. When\nI showed myself over a gentleman's gate, in the hope of selling fish to\nhim, it used to be always, \"At him, Pincher!\" \"Into his legs, Growler,\nboy!\" so that I was compelled to carry my conger-rod to save me. Now,\nhowever, and for a season till my fame grew stale, I never lifted the\nlatch of a gate without hearing grateful utterance, \"Towser, down, you\nson of a gun! Yelp and Vick, hold your stupid tongues, will you?\" The\nvalue of my legs was largely understood by gentlemen. As for the ladies\nand the housemaids, if conceit were in my nature, what a run it would\nhave had! Always and always the same am I, and above even women's\nopinions. But I know no other man whose head would not have been turned\nwith a day of it. For my rap at the door was scarcely given (louder,\nperhaps, than it used to be) before every maid in the house was out, and\nthe lady looking through the blinds. I used to dance on the step, and\nbeat my arms on my breast, with my basket down between my legs, and\ntremble almost for a second rap; and then it was, \"Like your imperence!\"\n\"None of your stinking stuff!\" and so on. But now they ran down\nbeautifully, and looked up under their eyelids at me, and left me to\nshow them what I liked, and never beat down a halfpenny, and even\naccepted my own weight. Such is the grand effect of glory; and I might\nhave kissed every one of them, and many even of the good plain cooks, if\nI could have reconciled it with my sense of greatness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nA CRAFT BEYOND THE LAW.\n\n\nColonel Lougher, of Candleston Court, was one of the finest and noblest\nmen it was ever my luck to come across. He never would hear a word\nagainst me, any more than I would against him; and no sooner did I see\nhim upon the Bench than I ceased to care what the evidence was. If they\nfailed to prove their falsehoods (as nearly always came to pass), he\ndismissed them with a stern reprimand for taking away my character; and\nif they seemed to establish anything by low devices against me, what did\nhe say? Why, no more than this: \"David, if what they say be true, you\nappear to have forgotten yourself in a very unusual manner. You have\npromised me always to improve; and I thought that you were doing it.\nThis seems to be a trifling charge--however, I must convict you. The\npenalty is one shilling, and the costs fifteen.\"\n\n\"May it please your worship,\" I always used to answer, \"is an honest man\nto lose his good name, and pay those who have none for stealing it?\"\n\nHaving seen a good deal of the world, he always felt the force of this,\nbut found it difficult to say so with prejudiced men observing him. Only\nI knew that my fine and costs would be slipped into my hand by-and-by,\nwith a glimpse of the Candleston livery.\n\nThis was no more than fair between us; for not more than seven\ngenerations had passed since Griffith Llewellyn, of my true stock, had\nbeen the proper and only bard to the great Lord Lougher of Coity, whence\ndescended our good Colonel. There had been some little mistake about the\ndeparture of the title, no doubt through extremes of honesty, but no\nlord in the county came of better blood than Colonel Lougher. To such a\nman it was a hopeless thing for the bitterest enemy--if he had one--to\nimpute one white hair's breadth of departure from the truth. A\nthoroughly noble man to look at, and a noble man to hearken to, because\nhe knew not his own kindness, but was kind to every one. Now this good\nman had no child at all, as generally happens to very good men, for fear\nof mankind improving much. And the great king of Israel, David, from\nwhom our family has a tradition--yet without any Jewish blood in us--he\nsays (if I am not mistaken) that it is a sure mark of the ungodly to\nhave children at their desire, and to leave the rest of their substance\nto ungodly infants.\n\nNot to be all alone, the Colonel, after the death of his excellent wife,\npersuaded his only sister, the Lady Bluett, widow of Lord Bluett, to set\nup with him at Candleston. And this she was not very loath to do,\nbecause her eldest son, the present Lord Bluett, was of a wild and\nsporting turn, and no sooner became of age but that he wanted no mother\nover him. Therefore she left him for a while to his own devices, hoping\nevery month to hear of his suddenly repenting.\n\nNow this was a lady fit to look at. You might travel all day among\npeople that kept drawing-rooms, and greenhouses, and the new safe of\nmusic, well named from its colour \"grand paeony,\" and you might go up and\ndown Bridgend, even on a fair-day, yet nobody would you set eyes on fit\nto be looked at as a lady on the day that you saw Lady Bluett.\n\nIt was not that she pretended anything; that made all the difference.\nOnly she felt such a thorough knowledge that she was no more than we\nmight have been, except for a width of accidents. And nothing ever\nparted her from any one with good in him. For instance, the first time\nshe saw me again (after thirty years, perhaps, from the season of her\nbeauty-charm, when I had chanced to win all the prizes in the sports\ngiven at Candleston Court, for the manhood of now Colonel Lougher), not\nonly did she at once recognise me, in spite of all my battering, but she\nheld out her beautiful hand, and said, \"How are you, Mr Llewellyn?\"\nNobody had ever called me \"Mr Llewellyn\" much till then; but, by good\nluck, a washerwoman heard it and repeated it; and since that day there\nare not many people (leaving out clods and low enemies) with the face to\naccost me otherwise.\n\nHowever, this is not to the purpose, any more than it is worthy of me.\nHow can it matter what people call me when I am clear of my fish-basket?\nas, indeed, I always feel at the moment of unstrapping. No longer any\nreputation to require my fist ready. I have done my utmost, and I have\nreceived the money.\n\nThese are the fine perceptions which preserve a man of my position from\nthe effects of calumny. And, next to myself, the principal guardian of\nmy honour was this noble Colonel Lougher. Moreover, a fine little chap\nthere was, Lady Bluett's younger son, Honourable Rodney Bluett by name;\nfor his father had served under Admiral Rodney, and been very friendly\nwith him, and brought him to church as a godfather. This young Rodney\nBluett was about ten years old at that time, and the main delight of his\nlife was this, to come fishing with old Davy. The wondrous yarns I used\nto spin had such an effect on his little brain, that his prospects on\ndry land, and love of his mother, and certain inheritance from the\nColonel, were helpless to keep him from longing always to see the things\nwhich I had seen. With his large blue eyes upon me, and his flaxen hair\ntied back, and his sleeves tucked up for paddling, hour by hour he would\nlisten, when the weather was too rough to do much more than look at it.\nOr if we went out in a boat (as we did when he could pay for hiring, and\nwhen his mother was out of the way), many and many a time I found him,\nwhen he should have been quick with the bait, dwelling upon the fine\nideas which my tales had bred in him. I took no trouble in telling them,\nneither did I spare the truth when it would come in clumsily (like a\nlubber who cannot touch his hat), but they all smelled good and true,\nbecause they had that character.\n\nHowever, he must bide his time, as every one of us has to do, before I\nmake too much of him. And just at the period now in hand he was down in\nmy black books for never coming near me. It may have been that he had\norders not to be so much with me, and very likely that was wise; for\nneither his mother nor his uncle could bear the idea of his going to\nsea, but meant to make a red herring of him, as we call those poor\nland-soldiers. Being so used to his pretty company, and his admiration,\nalso helping him as I did to spend his pocket-money, I missed him more\nthan I could have believed; neither could I help sorrowing at this great\nloss of opportunity; for many an honest shilling might have been turned\nere winter by the hire of my boat to him when he came out with me\nfishing. I had prepared a scale of charges, very little over Captain\nBob's, to whom he used to pay 4d. an hour, when I let him come after the\nwhiting with me. And now, for no more than 6d. an hour, he should have\nmy very superior boat, and keep her head by my directions, for he\nunderstood a rudder, and bait my hooks, and stow my fish, and enjoy (as\nall boys should) the idea of being useful.\n\nFor, as concerns that little barkie, I had by this time secured myself\nfrom any further uneasiness, or troublesome need of concealment, by a\nbold and spirited facing of facts, which deserve the congratulation of\nall honest fishermen. The boat, like her little captain, was at first\nall white--as I may have said--but now, before her appearance in public,\nI painted her gunwale and strakes bright blue, even down to her\nwater-mark; and then, without meddling with her name, or rather that of\nthe ship she belonged to, I retraced very lightly, but so that any one\ncould read it, the name of the port from which she hailed, and which (as\nI felt certain now, from what I had seen on the poor wrecked ship) must\nhave been San Salvador; and the three last letters were so plain, that I\nscarcely had to touch them.\n\nNow this being done, and an old worn painter shipped instead of the new\none, which seemed to have been chopped off with an axe, I borrowed a\nboat and stood off to sea from Porthcawl Point, where they beach them,\nhaving my tackle and bait on board, as if for an evening off the Tuskar,\nwhere turbot and whiting-pollack are. Here I fished until dusk of the\nnight, and as long as the people ashore could see me; but as soon as all\nwas dark and quiet, I just pulled into Newton Bay, and landed opposite\nthe old \"Red house,\" where my new boat lay in ordinary, snug as could\nbe, and all out of sight. For the ruins of this old \"Red house\" had such\na repute for being haunted, ever since a dreadful murder cast a ban\naround it, that even I never wished to stop longer than need be there at\nnight; and once or twice I heard a noise that went to the marrow of my\nback; of which, however, I will say no more, until it comes to the\nproper place. Enough that no man, woman, or child, for twenty miles\nround, except myself, had a conscience clear enough to go in there after\ndark, and scarcely even by daylight. My little craft was so light and\nhandy, that, with the aid of the rollers ready, I led her down over the\nbeach myself, and presently towed her out to sea, with the water as\nsmooth as a duck-pond, and the tide of the neap very silent. The weather\nwas such as I could not doubt, being now so full of experience.\nTherefore, I had no fear to lie in a very dangerous berth indeed, when\nany cockle of a sea gets up, or even strong tides are running. This was\nthe west-end fork of the Tuskar, making what we call \"callipers;\" for\nthe back of the Tuskar dries at half-ebb, and a wonderful ridge stops\nthe run of the tide, not only for weeds but for fish as well. Here with\nmy anchor down, I slept, as only a virtuous man can sleep.\n\nIn the grey of the morning, I was up, ere the waning moon was done with,\nand found the very thing to suit me going on delightfully. The heavy dew\nof autumn, rising from the land by perspiration, spread a cloud along\nthe shore. A little mist was also crawling on the water here and there;\nand having slept with a watch-coat and tarpaulin over me, I shook myself\nup, without an ache, and like a good bee at the gate of the hive, was\nbrisk for making honey.\n\nHence I pulled away from land, with the heavy boat towing the light one,\nand even Sandy Macraw unable to lay his gimlet eye on me. And thus I\nrowed, until quite certain of being over three miles from land. Then\nwith the broad sun rising nobly, and for a moment bowing, till the white\nfog opened avenues, I spread upon my pole a shirt which mother Jones had\nwashed for me. It was the time when Sandy Macraw was bound to be up to\nhis business; and I had always made a point of seeing that he did it. To\nhave a low fellow of itchy character, and no royal breed about him,\nthrust by a feeble and reckless government into the berth that by nature\nwas mine, and to find him not content with this, but even in his hours\nof duty poaching, both day and night, after my fish; and when I desired\nto argue with him, holding his tongue to irritate me,--satisfaction\nthere could be none for it; the only alleviation left me was to rout up\nthis man right early, and allow him no chance of napping.\n\nTherefore, I challenged him with my shirt, thus early in the morning,\nbecause he was bound to be watching the world, if he acted up to his\nnasty business, such as no seaman would deign to; and after a quarter of\nan hour perhaps, very likely it was his wife that answered. At any rate\nthere was a signal up, and through my spy-glass I saw that people wanted\nto launch a boat, but failed. Therefore I made a great waving of shirt,\nas much as to say, \"extreme emergency; have the courage to try again.\"\nExpecting something good from this, they laid their shoulders, and\nworked their legs, and presently the boat was bowing on the\ngently-fluted sea.\n\nNow it was not that I wanted help, for I could have managed it all well\nenough; but I wanted witnesses. For never can I bear to seem to set at\nnought legality. And these men were sure, upon half-a-crown, to place\nthe facts before the public in an honest manner. So I let them row away\nfor the very lives of them, as if the salvage of the nation hung upon\ntheir thumbs and elbows; only I dowsed my shirt as soon as I found them\ngetting eager. And I thought that they might as well hail me first, and\nslope off disappointment.\n\n\"Hoy there! Boat ahoy! What, old Davy Llewellyn!\"\n\nWhat man had a right to call me \"old\"? There I was as fresh as ever. And\nI felt it the more that the man who did it was grey on the cheeks with a\nvery large family, and himself that vile old Sandy! Nevertheless I\npreserved good manners.\n\n\"Ship your starboard oars, you lubbers. Do you want to run me down? What\nthe devil brings you here, at this time of the morning?\" Hereupon these\nworthy fellows dropped their oars, from wonder; until I showed them\ntheir mistake, and begged them to sheer off a little. For if I had\naccepted rope, such as they wished to throw me, they might have put in\nadverse claims, and made me pay for my own boat!\n\n\"When a poor man has been at work all night,\" said I, to break off their\nofficiousness; \"while all you lazy galley-rakers were abed and snoring,\ncan't he put his shirt to dry, without you wanting to plunder him?\"\n\nTo temper off what might appear a little rude, though wholesome, I now\npermitted them to see a stoneware gallon full of beer, or at least I had\nonly had two pints out. Finding this to be the case, and being hot with\nrowing so rapidly to my rescue, they were well content to have some\nbeer, and drop all further claims. And as I never can bear to be mean, I\ngave them the two and sixpence also.\n\nSandy Macraw took all this money; and I only hope that he shared it\nduly; and then, as he never seemed at all to understand my contempt of\nhim, he spoke in that dry drawl of his, which he always droned to drive\nme into very dreadful words, and then to keep his distance.\n\n\"I am heartily glad, ma mon, to see the loock ye have encoontered. Never\nshall ye say agin that I have the advantage of ye. The boit stud me in\nmickle siller; but ye have grappit a boit for nort.\"\n\nI cannot write down his outlandish manner of pronouncing English; nor\nwill I say much more about it; because he concealed his jealousy so,\nthat I had no enjoyment of it, except when I reasoned with myself. And I\nneed have expected nothing better from such a self-controlling rogue.\nBut when we came to Porthcawl Point--where some shelter is from wind,\nand two public-houses, and one private--the whole affair was so\nstraightforward, and the distance of my boat from shore, at time of\ncapture, so established and so witnessed, that no steward of any manor\ndurst even cast sheep's-eyes at her. A paper was drawn up and signed;\nand the two public-houses, at my expense, christened her \"Old Davy.\"\nAnd indeed, for a little spell, I had enough to do with people, who came\nat all hours of the day, to drink the health of my boat and me; many of\nwhom seemed to fail to remember really who was the one to pay. And being\nstill in cash a little, and so generous always, I found a whole basket\nof whiting, and three large congers, and a lobster, disappear against\nchalk-marks, whereof I had no warning, and far worse, no flavour. But\nwhat I used to laugh at was, that when we explained to one another how\nthe law lay on this question, and how the craft became legally mine, as\na derelict from the Andalusia, drifting at more than a league from\nland,--all our folk being short and shallow in the English language,\ntook up the word, and called my boat, all over the parish, my \"RELICT;\"\nas if, in spite of the Creator's wisdom, I were dead and my wife alive!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL INTERCOURSE.\n\n\nBut everybody must be tired of all this trouble about that boat. It\nshows what a state of things we live in, and what a meddlesome lot we\nare, that a good man cannot receive a gift straight into his hands from\nProvidence, which never before rewarded him, though he said his prayers\nevery night almost, and did his very best to cheat nobody; it proves, at\nleast to my mind, something very rotten somewhere, when a man of\nblameless character must prove his right to what he finds. However, I\nhad proved my right, and cut in Colonel Lougher's woods a larger pole\nthan usual, because the law would guarantee me, if at all assaulted.\n\nAnd truly, after all my care to be on the right side of it, such a vile\nattack of law was now impending on me, that with all my study of it, and\nperpetual attempts to jam its helm up almost into the very eye of\nreason, my sails very nearly failed to draw, and left me shivering in\nthe wind. But first for what comes foremost.\n\nAt that particular moment all things seemed to be most satisfactory.\nHere was my property duly secured and most useful to me, here was a run\nof fish up from the Mumbles of a very superior character, here was my\nown reputation spread by the vigilance of the public press, so that I\ncharged three farthings a-pound more than Sandy Mac did, and here was my\ncottage once more all alive with the mirth of our Bunny and Bardie. To\nsee them playing at hide-and-seek with two chairs and a table; or\n\"French and English,\" which I taught them; or \"come and visit my\ngrandmother;\" or making a cat of the kettle-holder, with a pair of ears\nand a tail to it; or giving a noble dinner-party with cockles and\noyster-shells, and buttons, and apple-peel chopped finely; or, what was\neven a grander thing, eating their own dinners prettily, with their\ndolls beside them,--scarcely any one would have believed that these\nlittle ones had no mothers.\n\nAnd yet they did not altogether seem to be forgetful, or to view the\nworld as if there were no serious side to it. Very grave discourse was\nsometimes held between their bouts of play, and subjects of great depth\nand wonder introduced by doll's clothes. For instance:--\n\n\"Hasn't 'a got no mama, poor Bunny, to thread 'e needle?\"\n\n\"No, my dear,\" I answered, for my grandchild looked stupid about it;\n\"poor Bunny's mother is gone to heaven.\"\n\n\"My mama not gone to heaven. My mama come demorrow-day. I'se almost\ntired of yaiting, old Davy, but she sure to come demorrow-day.\"\n\nBut as the brave little creature spoke, I saw that \"the dust was in her\neyes.\" This was her own expression always, to escape the reproach of\ncrying, when her lonely heart was working with its misty troubles, and\nsent the tears into her eyes, before the tongue could tell of them.\n\"Demorrow-day, demorrow-day,\" all her loss was to be recovered always on\n\"demorrow-day.\"\n\nNot even so much as a doll had been saved from the total wreck of her\nfortunes; and when I beheld her wistful eyes set one day upon Bunny's\ndoll--although only fit for hospital, having one arm and one leg and no\nnose, besides her neck being broken--I set to at once and sharpened my\nknife upon a piece of sandstone. Then I sought out a piece of abele,\nlaid by from the figure-head of a wrecked Dutchman, and in earnest I\nfell to, and shaped such a carving of a doll as never was seen before or\nsince. Of course the little pet came, and stood, and watched every chip\nas I sliced it along, with sighs of deep expectancy, and a laugh when I\ngot to the tail of it; and of course she picked up every one, not only\nas neatest of the neat, but also accounting them sacred offsets of the\nmysterious doll unborn. I could not get her to go to bed; and it was as\ngood as a guinea to me to see the dancing in her eyes, and the spring of\nher body returning.\n\n\"'E can make a boofely doll, old Davy; but 'e doesn't know the yay to\ndess a doll.\"\n\n\"You are quite wrong there,\" said I, perceiving that I should go up, or\ndown, according to my assertion; and it made her open her eyes to see me\ncut out, with about five snips, a pair of drawers quite good enough for\nany decent woman. And she went to bed hugging the doll in that state,\nand praying to have her improved to-morrow.\n\nAt breakfast-time mother Jones dropped in, for she loved a good\nsalt-herring, and to lay down the law for the day almost; as if I knew\nscarce anything. And I always let her have her talk, and listened to it\ngravely; and clever women, as a rule, should not be denied of this\nattention; for if they are, it sours them. While she was sucking the\nlast of the tail, and telling me excellent scandal, my little lady\nmarched in straight, having finished her breakfast long ago, and bearing\nher new doll pompously. The fly-away colour in her cheeks, which always\nmade her beautiful, and the sparkle of her gleeful eyes, were come again\nwith pleasure, and so was the lovely pink of her lips, and the proper\naspect of her nose. Also she walked with such motherly rank, throwing\nher legs with a female jerk--it is enough for me to say that any\nnewly-married woman would have kissed her all round the room.\n\nNow, mother Jones, having ten fine children (five male and five female)\ngoing about with clothes up to their forks, need not have done what she\ndid, I think, and made me so bashful in my own house. For no sooner did\nshe see this doll, than she cried, \"Oh, my!\" and covered up her face.\nThe little maid looked up at me in great wonder, as if I were leading\nher astray; and I felt so angry with Mrs Jones, after all the things I\nhad seen abroad, and even in English churches, that I would not trust\nmyself to speak. However, to pay her out for that, I begged her to cure\nthe mischief herself, which she could not well decline; and some of the\ngreen blind still remaining, Dolly became a most handsome sight, with a\ncrackle in front and a sweeping behind, so that our clerk, a good\nnatured man, was invited to christen her; and \"Patty Green\" was the name\nhe gave: and Bunny's doll was nobody. Such a baby-like thing might seem\nalmost below my dignity, and that of all the rest of us; only this child\nhad the power to lead us, as by a special enchantment, back to our own\nchildhood. Moreover, it was needful for me to go through with this\ndoll's birth (still more so with her dress, of course, having her a\nfemale), because through her I learned a great deal more of Bardie's\nhistory than ever our Bunny could extract.\n\nEverybody who has no patience with the ways of childhood, may be vexed,\nand must be vexed, with our shipwrecked maid for knowing many things,\nbut not the right; but I think she was to blame, only for her innocence.\nIn her tiny brain was moving some uncertain sense of wrong; whether done\nby herself, or to her, was beyond her infant groping. If she could have\nmade her mind up, in its little milky shell, that the evil had befallen,\nwithout harm on her part, doubtless she had done her best to let us know\nthe whole of it. Her best, of course, would be but little, looking at\nher age and so on; and perhaps from some harsh word or frown, stamped\ninto the tender flux of infantile memory, a heavy dread both darkened\nand repressed much recollection. Hence, if one tried to examine her, in\norder to find out who she was, she would shake her head, and say, \"No!\nsompfin;\" as she always did when puzzled or unable to pronounce a word.\nThe only chance of learning even any little things she knew, was to\nleave her to her own way, and not interrupt her conversation with wooden\nor crockery playmates. All of these she endowed with life, having such\npower of life herself, and she reckoned them up for good behaviour, or\nfor bad, as the case might be. And often was I touched at heart, after a\nday of bitter fighting with a world that wronged me, by hearing her in\nbaby-prattle tell her playthings of their unkindness to a little thing\nwith none to love her.\n\nBut when I had finished Patty's face up to complete expression, with two\nblack buttons for her eyes, and a cowry for her mouth, and a nose of\ncoral, also a glorious head of hair of crinkled sea-weed growing out of\na shell (toothed like an ivory comb almost), the ecstasy of the child\nwas such, that I obtained, as well as deserved, some valuable\ninformation.\n\n\"Patty Geen, 'e's been aye good,\" I heard her say in my window-place,\none morning after breakfast; \"and 'e is the most boofely doll ever seen,\nand I tell 'a sompfin; only 'e musn't tell anybody, till my dear mama\ncomes. Nat wasn't ickle bother, Patty.\"\n\n\"How do you know, Miss?\" Patty inquired by means of my voice in the\ndistance, and a little art I had learned abroad of throwing it into\ncorners.\n\n\"I tell 'a, Patty, I tell 'a. I 'ouldn't tell 'e nasty man, but I tell\nold Davy some day. Ickle bother not like nat at all. Ickle bother not so\nbig enough, and only two ickle teeth in front, and his hair all gone\nayay it is, but mama say soon come back again.\"\n\n\"And what is little brother's name?\" said Patty, in a whisper; \"and what\nis your name and papa's?\"\n\n\"Oh, 'e silly Patty Geen! As if 'e didn't know I'se Bardie, ever since I\nwas anytin. And papa, is papa, he is. Patty, I'se kite ashamed of 'a.\n'E's such a silly ickle fin!\"\n\n\"Well, I know I am not very clever, Miss. But tell me some more things\nyou remember.\"\n\n\"I tell 'a, if 'e stop kiet. 'I 'ish 'a many happy turns of the day,\nMiss Bardie. Many happy turns of the day to 'a!' And poor Bardie get off\nher stool, and say what her dear papa tell. 'Gentleyums and yadies, I'se\naye much obiged to 'a.' And then have boofely appledies, and carbies,\nand a ickle dop of good yiney-piney. Does 'e know 'hot that means, poor\nPatty?\"\n\n\"No, my dear; how should I know?\"\n\n\"'E mustn't call me 'my dear,' I tell 'a. 'E must know 'a's pace in\nyife. Why, 'e's only a doll, Patty, and Bardie's a young yady, and a\n'streamly 'cocious gal I is, and the gentleyums all say so. Ickle bother\ncan't say nuffin, without me to sow him the yay of it. But Bardie say\nalmost anyfin; anyfin, when I yikes to ty. Bardie say 'Pomyoleanian\ndog!'\"\n\nThis cost her a long breath, and a great effort; but Patty expressed\nintense amazement at such power of diction, and begged to know something\nmore about that extraordinary animal.\n\n\"Pomyoleanian dog is yite, yite all over 'sept his collar, and his\ncollar's boo. And he's got hair that long, Patty, ever so much longer\nthan yours. And he yun yound and yound, he does. Oh, I do so yant my\nPomyoleanian dog!\"\n\nPatty waited for two great tears to run quietly down two little cheeks;\nand then she expressed some contempt of the dog, and a strong desire to\nhear some more about the happy turns of the day.\n\n\"Don't 'e be jealous, now, Patty, I tell 'a. 'E ickle yite dog can eat,\nbut 'e can't. And happy turns of the day is yen a geat big gal is two\nyears old with a ickle bother. And he can't say nuffin, 'cos he grow\ntoo strong enough, and 'e young yady must repy; and ayebody yooks at 'a,\nand yaffs, and put 'e gasses up, and say, 'Hot a 'cocious ickle fin!'\nAnd my dear papa say, 'Hot a good gal!' and mama come and tiss 'a all\nover a'most, and then 'e all have some more puddeny-pie!\"\n\nOvercome with that last memory, she could go no further; and being\nunable to give her pies, I felt myself bound to abandon any more\ninquiries. For that child scarcely ever roared, so as to obtain relief;\nbut seemed with a kind of self-control--such as unlucky people form,\nhowever early in their lives--to take her troubles inwardly, and to be\nfull to the very lip of them, without the power of spilling. This,\nthough a comfort to other people, is far worse for themselves, I fear.\nAnd I knew that she did love pastry rarely; for one day, after a fine\npair of soles, I said to the two children, \"Now, put your little hands\ntogether, and thank God for a good dinner.\" Bunny did this in a grateful\nmanner, but Bardie said, \"No, I 'ont, old Davy; I'll thank God when I\ngets puddeny-pie.\"\n\nUpon the whole, I concluded thus, that the little creature was after all\n(and as might have been expected with any other child almost) too young,\nin the third year of her age, to maintain any clear ideas of place, or\ntime, or names, or doings, or anything that might establish from her own\nwords only, whence she came or who she was. However, I now knew quite\nenough, if the right people ever came to seek for her, to \"'dentify\"\nher, as she expressed it to that stupid Coroner.\n\nMoxy Thomas came to fetch her back to Sker, in a few days' time. I was\nnow resolved to keep her, and she resolved to stay with me--and\ndoubtless I had first right to her. But when I saw poor Moxy's face, and\ncalled to mind her desolation, and when she kissed my fishy hand to let\nher have this comfort, after all the Lord had taken from her, I could\nnot find it in my heart to stand to my own interest. It came across me\ntoo that Bardie scarcely throve on so much fish; and we never had any\nbutcher's meat, or meat of any kind at all, unless I took shares in a\npig, after saving up money for Christmas, or contrived to defend myself\nagainst the hares that would run at me so, when I happened to come\nthrough a gate at night.\n\nSo with a clearly-pronounced brave roar, having more music than Bunny's\nin it, and enough to wash a great deal of \"dust\" out of her woefully\nlingering eyes, away she went in Moxy's arms, with Patty Green in her\nown looking likely to get wet through. And Bunny stuck her thumbs into\nmy legs, which she had a knack of doing, especially after sucking them;\nso thus we stood, at our cottage door, looking after Bardie; and I took\noff my hat, and she spread her hand out, in the intervals of woe; and\nlittle thought either of us, I daresay, of the many troubles in store\nfor us both.\n\nOnly before that grievous parting, she had done a little thing which\ncertainly did amaze me. And if anybody knows the like, I shall be glad\nto hear of it. I had a snug and tidy locker very near the fireplace,\nwherein I kept some little trifles; such as Bunny had an eye for, but\nwas gradually broken into distant admiration. One morning I came\nsuddenly in from looking to my night-lines, and a pretty scene I saw.\nThe door of my cupboard was wide open, and there stood little Bardie\ngiving a finishing lick to her fingers. Bunny also in the corner, with\nher black eyes staring, as if at the end of the world itself. However,\nher pinafore was full.\n\nNo sooner did my grandchild see me, than she rushed away with shrieks,\ncasting down all stolen goods in agony of conscience. I expected Bardie\nto do the same; but to my great wonderment up she walked and faced me.\n\n\"Must I beat poor Patty Geen?\" The tears were in her eyes at having to\npropose so sad a thing. And she stroked the doll, to comfort her.\n\n\"Beat poor Patty!\" said I, in amazement. \"Why, what harm has Patty\ndone?\"\n\n\"Nare she have been, all 'e time, stealing 'a soogar, old Davy!\" And she\nlooked at me as if she had done a good turn by the information. I\nscarcely knew what to do, I declare; for her doll was so truly alive to\nher, that she might and perhaps did believe it. However, I shut her in\nmy little bedroom, until her heart was almost broken; and then I tried\nto reason with her, on the subject of telling lies; but she could not\nunderstand what they were; until I said what I was forced to do, when I\nwent among bad people.\n\nThat evening, after she was gone, and while I was very dull about it,\nfinding poor Bunny so slow and stupid, and nothing to keep me wide\nawake--there I was bound to be wide awake, more than at Petty Sessions\neven, when mine enemies throng against me. For almost before I had\nsmoked two pipes, or made up my mind what to do with myself, finding a\nhollow inside of me, the great posting-coach from Bridgend came up, with\nthe sun setting bright on its varnish, and at my very door it stopped.\nNext to the driver sat a constable who was always unjust to me; and\nfrom the inside came out first Justice Anthony Stew of Pen Coed, as\nodious and as meddlesome a justice of the peace as ever signed a\nwarrant; and after him came a tall elderly gentleman, on whom I had\nnever set eyes before, but I felt that he must be a magistrate.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nCROSS-EXAMINATION.\n\n\nThose justices of the peace, although appointed by his Majesty, have\nnever been a comfort to me, saving only Colonel Lougher. They never seem\nto understand me, or to make out my desires, or to take me at my word,\nas much as I take them at theirs. My desire has always been to live in a\npainfully loyal manner, to put up with petty insults from customers who\nknow no better, leaving them to self-reflection, and if possible to\nrepentance, while I go my peaceful way, nor let them hear their money\njingle, or even spend it in their sight. To be pleased and trustful also\nwith the folk who trust in me, and rather to abandon much, and give back\ntwopence in a shilling, than cause any purchaser self-reproach for\nhaving sworn falsely before the bench,--now, if all this would not do,\nto keep me out of the session-books, can any man point out a clearer\nproof of the vicious administration of what they call \"justice\" around\nour parts? And when any trumpery case was got up, on purpose to worry\nand plague me, the only chance left me, of any fair-play, was to throw\nup my day's work, and wear out my shoes in trudging to Candleston Court,\nto implore that good Colonel Lougher to happen to sit on the bench that\nday.\n\nWhen those two gentlemen alighted from that rickety old coach, and\nordered that very low constable to pace to and fro at the door of my\nhouse, boldly I came out to meet them, having injured no man, nor done\nharm of any sort that I could think of, lately. Stew came first, a man\nof no lineage, but pushed on by impudence; \"Anthony Stew can look you\nthrough,\" an English poacher said of him; and this he tried always to do\nwith me, and thoroughly welcome he was to succeed.\n\nI will not say that my inner movements may not have been uneasy, in\nspite of all my rectitude; however, I showed their two worships inside,\nin the very host style of the quarter-deck such as I had gathered from\nthat coroneted captain, my proud connection with whom, perhaps, I may\nhave spoken of ere this, or at any rate ought to have done so, for I had\nthe honour of swabbing his pumps for him almost every morning; and he\nwas kind enough to call me \"Davy.\"\n\nEvery Briton, in his own house, is bound to do his utmost; so I touched\nmy grey forelock, and made two good bows, and set a chair for each of\nthem, happening to have no more just now, though with plenty of money to\nbuy them. Self-controlled as I always am, many things had tried me, of\nlate, almost to the verge of patience; such imputations as fall most\ntenderly on a sorrowful widower; and my pure admiration of Bardie, and\ncertainty of her lofty birth, had made me the more despise such\nfoulness. So it came to pass that two scandalous men were given over by\nthe doctors (for the pole I had cut was a trifle too thick),\nnevertheless they recovered bravely, and showed no more gratitude\ntowards God, than to take out warrants against me! But their low devices\nwere frustrated by the charge being taken before Colonel Lougher. And\nwhat did that excellent magistrate do? He felt himself compelled to do\nsomething. Therefore he fined me a shilling per head for the two heads\nbroken, with 10s. costs (which he paid, as usual), and gave me a very\nsevere reprimand.\n\n\"Llewellyn,\" he said, \"the time is come for you to leave off this course\nof action. I do not wonder that you felt provoked; but you must seek for\nsatisfaction in the legal channels. Suppose these men had possessed thin\nheads, why you might have been guilty of murder! Make out his commitment\nto Cardiff Gaol, in default of immediate payment.\"\n\nAll this was good, and sustained one's faith in the efficacy of British\nlaw; and trusting that nothing might now be amiss in the minds of these\ntwo magistrates, I fetched the block of sycamore, whereupon my fish were\nin the habit of having their fins and tails chopped off; and there I\nsate down, and presented myself both ready and respectful. On the other\nhand, my visitors looked very grave and silent; whether it were to\nprolong my doubts, or as having doubts of their own, perhaps.\n\n\"Your worships,\" I began at last, in fear of growing timorous, with any\nlonger waiting--\"your worships must have driven far.\"\n\n\"To see you, Llewellyn,\" Squire Stew said, with a nasty snap, hoping the\nmore to frighten me.\n\n\"Not only a pleasure to me, your worships, but a very great honour to my\npoor house. What will your worships be pleased to eat? Butcher's meat I\nwould have had, if only I had known of it. But one thing I can truly\nsay, my cottage has the best of fish.\"\n\n\"That I can believe,\" said Stew; \"because you sell all the worst to me.\nAnother such a trick, Llewellyn, and I have you in the stocks.\"\n\nThis astonished me so much--for his fish had never died over four\ndays--that nothing but my countenance could express my feelings.\n\n\"I crave your pardon, Justice Stew,\" said the tall grey gentleman with\nthe velvet coat, as he rose in a manner that overawed me, for he stood a\ngood foot over Anthony Stew, and a couple of inches over me; \"may we not\nenter upon the matter which has led us to this place?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Sir Philip, certainly,\" Stew replied, with a style which\nproved that Sir Philip must be of no small position; \"all I meant, Sir\nPhilip, was just to let you see the sort of fellow we have to deal\nwith.\"\n\n\"My integrity is well known,\" I answered, turning from him to the\ngentleman; \"not only in this parish, but for miles and miles round. It\nis not my habit to praise myself; and in truth I find no necessity. Even\na famous newspaper, so far away as Bristol, the celebrated 'Felix\nFarley's Journal'----\"\n\n\"Just so,\" said the elder gentleman; \"it is that which has brought us\nhere; although, as I fear, on a hopeless errand.\"\n\nWith these words he leaned away, as if he had been long accustomed to be\ndisappointed. To me it was no small relief to find their business\npeaceable, and that neither a hare which had rushed at me like a lion\nthrough a gate by moonlight, nor a stupid covey of partridges (nineteen\nin number, which gave me no peace while excluded from my dripping-pan),\nnor even a pheasant cock whose crowing was of the most insulting\ntone,--that none of these had been complaining to the bench emboldened\nme, and renewed my sense of reason. But I felt that Justice Stew could\nnot be trusted for a moment to take this point in a proper light.\nTherefore I kept my wits in the chains, taking soundings of them both.\n\n\"Now, Llewellyn, no nonsense, mind!\" began Squire Stew, with his face\nlike a hatchet, and scollops over his eyebrows: \"what we are come for is\nvery simple, and need not unsettle your conscience, as you have allowed\nit to do, I fear. Keep your aspect of innocent wonder for the next time\nyou are brought before me. I only wish your fish were as bright and\nslippery as you are.\"\n\n\"May I humbly ask what matter it pleases your worship to be thinking\nof?\"\n\n\"Oh, of course you cannot imagine, Davy. But let that pass, as you were\nacquitted, by virtue of your innocent face, in the teeth of all the\nevidence. If you had only dropped your eyes, instead of wondering so\nmuch--but never mind, stare as you may, some day we shall be sure to\nhave you.\"\n\nNow, I will put it to anybody whether this was not too bad, in my own\nhouse, and with the Bench seated on my own best chairs! However, knowing\nwhat a man he was, and how people do attribute to me things I never\ndreamed of, and what little chance a poor man has if he takes to\ncontradiction, all I did was to look my feelings, which were truly\nvirtuous. Nor were they lost upon Sir Philip.\n\n\"You will forgive me, good sir, I hope,\" he said to Squire Anthony; \"but\nunless we are come with any charge against this--Mr Llewellyn, it is\nhardly fair to reopen any awkward questions of which he has been\nacquitted. In his own house, moreover, and when he has offered kind\nhospitality to us--in a word, I will say no more.\"\n\nHere he stopped, for fear perhaps of vexing the other magistrate; and I\ntouched my grizzled curl and said, \"Sir, I thank you for a gentleman.\"\nThis was the way to get on with me, instead of driving and bullying; for\na gentleman or a lady can lead me to any extremes of truth; but not a\nlawyer, much less a justice. And Anthony Stew had no faith in truth,\nunless she came out to his own corkscrew.\n\n\"British tar,\" he exclaimed, with his nasty sneer; \"now for some more of\nyour heroism! You look as if you were up for doing something very\nglorious. I have seen that colour in your cheeks when you sold me a\nsewin that shone in the dark. A glorious exploit; wasn't it now?\"\n\n\"That it was, your worship, to such a customer as you.\"\n\nWhile Anthony Stew was digesting this, which seemed a puzzle to him, the\ntall grey gentleman, feeling but little interest in my commerce, again\ndesired to hurry matters. \"Forgive me again, I beseech you, good sir;\nbut ere long it will be dark, and as yet we have learned nothing.\"\n\n\"Leave it all to me, Sir Philip; your wisest plan is to leave it to me.\nI know all the people around these parts, and especially this fine\nfellow. I have made a sort of study of him, because I consider him what\nI may call a thoroughly typical character.\"\n\n\"I am not a typical character,\" I answered, over-hastily, for I found\nout afterwards what he meant. \"I never tipple; but when I drink, my rule\nis to go through with it.\"\n\nSquire Stew laughed loud at my mistake, as if he had been a great\nscholar himself; and even Sir Philip smiled a little in his sweet and\nlofty manner. No doubt but I was vexed for a moment, scenting (though I\ncould not see) error on my own part. But now I might defy them both,\never to write such a book as this. For vanity has always been so foreign\nto my nature, that I am sure to do my best, and, after all, think\nnothing of it, so long as people praise me. And now, in spite of all\nrude speeches, if Sir Philip had only come without that Squire Anthony,\nnot a thing of all that happened would I have retained from him. It is\nhopeless for people to say that my boat crippled speech on my part.\nTush! I would have pulled her plug out on the tail of the Tuskar rather\nthan one moment stand against the light for Bardie.\n\nSquire Stew asked me all sorts of questions having no more substance in\nthem than the blowing-hole at the end of an egg, or the bladder of a\nskate-fish. All of these I answered boldly, finding his foot outside my\nshoes. And so he came back again, as they do after trying foolish\nexcursions, to the very point he started with.\n\n\"Am I to understand, my good fellow, that the ship, which at least you\nallow to be wrecked, may have been or might have been something like a\nforeigner?\"\n\n\"Therein lies the point whereon your worship cannot follow me, any more\nthan could the Coroner. Neither he, nor his clerk, nor the rest of the\njury, would listen to common-sense about it. That ship no more came from\nAppledore than a whale was hatched from a herring's egg.\"\n\n\"I knew it; I knew it,\" broke in Sir Philip. \"They have only small\ncoasters at Appledore. I said that the newspaper must be wrong. However,\nfor the sake of my two poor sons, I am bound to leave no clue\nunfollowed. There is nothing more to be done, Mr Stew, except to express\nmy many and great obligations for your kindness.\" Herewith he made a\nmost stately bow, and gave even me a corner of it.\n\n\"Stay, Sir Philip; one moment more. This fellow is such a crafty file.\nCertain I am that he never would look so unnaturally frank and candid\nunless he were in his most slippery mood. You know the old proverb, I\ndaresay, 'Put a Taffy on his mettle, he'll boil Old Nick in his own\nfish-kettle.' Dyo, where did your boat come from?\"\n\nThis question he put in a very sudden, and I might well say vicious,\nmanner, darting a glance at me like the snake's tongues in the island of\nDas Cobras. I felt such contempt that I turned my back, and gave him a\nview of the \"boofely buckens\" admired so much by Bardie.\n\n\"Well done!\" he cried. \"Your resources, Dyo, are an infinite credit to\nyou. And, do you know, when I see your back, I can almost place some\nfaith in you. It is broad and flat and sturdy, Dyo. Ah! many a fine hare\nhas swung there head downwards. Nevertheless, we must see this boat.\"\n\nNothing irritates me more than what low Englishmen call \"chaff.\" I\nlike to be pleasant and jocular upon other people; but I don't like\nthat sort of thing tried upon me when I am not in the humour for it.\nTherefore I answered crustily, \"Your worship is welcome to see my boat,\nand go to sea in her if you please, with the plug out of her bottom.\nUnder Porthcawl Point she lies; and all the people there know all about\nher. Only, I will beg your worship to excuse my presence, lest you\nshould have low suspicions that I came to twist their testimony.\"\n\n\"Well said, David! well said, my fine fellow! Almost I begin to believe\nthee, in spite of all experience. Now, Sir Philip.\"\n\n\"Your pardon, good sir; I follow you into the carriage.\"\n\nSo off they set to examine my boat; and I hoped to see no more of them,\nfor one thing was certain--to wit, that their coachman never would face\nthe sandhills, and no road ever is, or ever can be, to Porthcawl; so\nthat these two worthy gentlemen needs must exert their noble legs for at\nleast one-half of the distance. And knowing that Squire Stew's soles\nwere soft, I thought it a blessing for him to improve the only soft part\nabout him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT.\n\n\nHighly pleased with these reflections, what did I do but take a pipe,\nand sit like a lord at my own doorway, having sent poor Bunny with a\nsmack to bed, because she had shown curiosity: for this leading vice of\nthe female race cannot be too soon discouraged. But now I began to fear\nalmost that it would be growing too dark very soon for me to see what\nbecame of the carriage returning with those two worships. Moreover, I\nfelt that I had no right to let them go so easily, without even knowing\nSir Philip's surname, or what might be the especial craze which had led\nthem to honour me so. And sundry other considerations slowly prevailed\nover me; until it would have gone sore with my mind, to be kept in the\ndark concerning them. So, when heavy dusk of autumn drove in over the\nnotch of sandhills from the far-away of sea, and the green of grass was\ngone, and you hardly could tell a boy from a girl among the children\nplaying, unless you knew their mothers; I rejoicing in their pleasures,\nquite forgot the justices. For all our children have a way of letting\nout their liveliness, such as makes old people feel a longing to be in\nwith them. Not like Bardie, of course; but still a satisfactory feeling.\nAnd the better my tobacco grew, the sweeter were my memories.\n\nBefore I had courted my wife and my sweethearts (a dozen and a-half\nperhaps, or at the outside say two dozen) anything more than twice\napiece, in the gentle cud of memory; and with very quiet sighs indeed,\nfor echoes of great thumping ones; and just as I wondered what execution\na beautiful child, with magnificent legs, would do when I lay in the\nchurchyard--all of a heap I was fetched out of dreaming into\ncommon-sense again. There was the great yellow coach at the corner of\nthe old grey wall that stopped the sand; and all the village children\nleft their \"hide-and-seek\" to whisper. Having fallen into a different\nmood from that of curiosity, and longing only for peace just now, or\ntender styles of going, back went I into my own cottage, hoping to hear\nthem smack whip and away. Even my hand was on the bolt--for a bolt I had\nnow on account of the cats, who understand every manner of latch,\nwherever any fish be--and perhaps it is a pity that I did not shoot it.\n\nBut there came three heavy knocks; and I scarcely had time to unbutton\nmy coat, in proof of their great intrusion, before I was forced to show\nmy face, and beg to know their business.\n\n\"Now, Dyo, Dyo,\" said that damned Stew [saving your presence, I can't\ncall him else]; \"this is a little too bad of you! Retiring ere dusk!\nAha! aha! And how many hours after midnight will you keep your hornpipes\nup, among the 'jolly sailors!' Great Davy, I admire you.\"\n\nI saw that it was not in his power to enter into my state of mind: nor\ncould I find any wit in his jokes, supposing them to be meant for such.\n\n\"Well, what did your worships think of Porthcawl?\" I asked, after\nsetting the chairs again, while I bustled about for my tinder-box: \"did\nyou happen to come across the man whose evil deeds are always being\nsaddled upon me?\"\n\n\"We found a respectable worthy Scotchman, whose name is Alexander\nMacraw; and who told us more in about five minutes than we got out of\nyou in an hour or more. He has given us stronger reason to hope that we\nmay be on the right track at last to explain a most painful mystery, and\nrelieve Sir Philip from the most cruel suspense and anxiety.\"\n\nAt these words of Squire Anthony, the tall grey gentleman with the\nvelvet coat bowed, and would fain have spoken, but feared perhaps that\nhis voice would tremble.\n\n\"Macraw thinks it highly probable,\" Justice Stew continued, \"that the\nship, though doubtless a foreigner, may have touched on the opposite\ncoast for supplies, after a long ocean voyage: and though Sir Philip has\nseen your boat, and considers it quite a stranger, that proves nothing\neither way, as the boat of course would belong to the ship. But one very\nsimple and speedy way there is of settling the question. You thought\nproper to conceal the fact that the Coroner had committed to your charge\nas foreman of the jury--and a precious jury it must have been--so as to\npreserve near the spot, in case of any inquiry, the dress of the poor\nchild washed ashore. This will save us the journey to Sker, which in the\ndusk would be dangerous. David Llewellyn, produce that dress, under my\nauthority.\"\n\n\"That I will, your worship, with the greatest pleasure. I am sure I\nwould have told you all about it, if I had only thought of it.\"\n\n\"Ahem!\" was all Squire Stew's reply, for a horribly suspicious man hates\nsuch downright honesty. But without taking further notice of him, I\nwent to my locker of old black oak, and thence I brought that upper\ngarment something like a pinafore, the sight of which had produced so\nstrong an effect upon the Coroner. It was made of the very finest linen,\nand perhaps had been meant for the child to wear in lieu of a frock in\nsome hot climate. As I brought this carefully up to the table, Squire\nStew cried, \"Light another candle,\" just as if I kept the village shop!\nThis I might have done at one time, if it had only happened to me, at\nthe proper period, to marry the niece of the man that lived next door to\nthe chapel, where they dried the tea-leaves. She took a serious liking\nto me, with my navy trousers on; but I was fool enough to find fault\nwith a little kink in her starboard eye. I could have carried on such a\ntrade, with my knowledge of what people are, and description of foreign\nclimates--however, it was not to be, and I had to buy my candles.\n\nAs soon as we made a fine strong light, both the gentlemen came nigh,\nand Sir Philip, who had said so little, even now forbore to speak. I\nheld the poor dress, tattered by much beating on the points of rocks;\nand as I unrolled it slowly, he withdrew his long white hands, lest we\nshould remark their quivering.\n\n\"You are not such fools as I thought,\" said Stew; \"it is a coronet\nbeyond doubt. I can trace the lines and crossings, though the threads\nare frayed a little. And here in the corner, a moneygrum--ah! you never\nsaw that, you stupes--do you know the mark, sir?\"\n\n\"I do not,\" Sir Philip answered, and seemed unable to fetch more words;\nand then like a strong man turned away, to hide all disappointment. Even\nAnthony Stew had the manners to feel that here was a sorrow beyond his\ndepth, and he covered his sense of it, like a gentleman, by some petty\ntalk with me. And it made me almost respect him to find that he dropped\nall his banter, as out of season.\n\nBut presently the tall grey gentleman recovered from his loss of hope,\nand with a fine brave face regarded us. And his voice was firm and very\nsweet.\n\n\"It is not right for me to cause you pain by my anxieties; and I fear\nthat you will condemn me for dwelling upon them overmuch. But you, Mr\nStew, already know, and you my friend have a right to know, after your\nkind and ready help, that it is not only the piteous loss of two little\ninnocent children, very dear ones both of them, but also the loss of\nfair repute to an honourable family, and the cruel suspicion cast upon\na fine brave fellow, who would scorn, sir, who would scorn, for the\nwealth of all this kingdom, to hurt the hair of a baby's head.\"\n\nHere Sir Philip's voice was choked with indignation more than sorrow,\nand he sat down quickly, and waved his hand, as much as to say, \"I am an\nold fool, I had much better not pretend to talk.\" And much as I longed\nto know all about it, of course it was not my place to ask.\n\n\"Exactly, my dear sir, exactly,\" Squire Anthony went on, for the sake of\nsaying something; \"I understand you, my dear sir, and feel for you, and\nrespect you greatly for your manly fortitude under this sad calamity.\nTrust in Providence, my dear sir; as indeed I need not tell you.\"\n\n\"I will do my best; but this is now the seventh disappointment we have\nhad. It would have been a heavy blow, of course, to have found the poor\nlittle fellow dead. But even that, with the recovery of the other, would\nhave been better than this dark mystery, and, above all, would have\nfreed the living from these maddening suspicions. But as it is, we must\ntry to bear it, and to say, 'God's will be done.' But I am thinking too\nmuch about ourselves. Mr Stew, I am very ungrateful not to think more of\nyour convenience. You must be longing to be at home.\"\n\n\"At your service, Sir Philip--quite at your service. My time is entirely\nmy own.\"\n\nThis was simply a bit of brag; and I saw that he was beginning to\nfidget; for, bold as his worship was on the bench, we knew that he was\nbut a coward at board, where Mrs Stew ruled with a rod of iron: and now\nit was long past dinner-time, even in the finest houses.\n\n\"One thing more, then, before we go,\" answered Sir Philip, rising;\n\"according to the newspaper, and as I hear, one young maiden was really\nsaved from that disastrous shipwreck. I wish we could have gone on to\nsee her; but I must return to-morrow morning, having left many anxious\nhearts behind. And to cross the sands in the dark, they say, is utterly\nimpossible.\"\n\n\"Not at all, Sir Philip,\" said I, very firmly, for I honestly wished\nto go through with it; \"although the sand is very deep, there is no\nfear at all, if one knows the track. It is only the cowardice of these\npeople ever since the sand-storm. I would answer to take you in the\ndarkest night, if only I had ever learned to drive,\" But Anthony Stew\nbroke in with a smile, \"It would grieve me to sit behind you, Dyo, and\nI trow that Sir Philip would never behold Appledore again. There is\nnothing these sailors will not attempt.\"\n\nAlthough I could sit the bow-thwart of a cart very well, with a boy to\ndrive me, and had often advised the hand at the tiller, and sometimes as\nmuch as held the whip, all this, to my diffidence, seemed too little to\nwarrant me in navigating a craft that carried two horses.\n\nSir Philip looked at me, and perhaps he thought that I had not the cut\nof a coachman. However, all he said was this:\n\n\"In spite of your kindness, Mr Stew, and your offer, my good sir\"--this\nwas to me, with much dignity--\"I perceive that we must not think of it.\nAnd of what use could it be except to add new troubles to old ones? Sir,\nI have trespassed too much on your kindness; in a minute I will follow\nyou.\" Anthony Stew, being thus addressed, was only too glad to skip into\nthe carriage. \"By, by, Dyo,\" he cried; \"mend your ways, if you can, my\nman. I think you have told fewer lies than usual; knock off one every\ntime of speaking, and in ten years you will speak the truth.\"\n\nOf this low rubbish I took no heed any more than any one would who knows\nme, especially as I beheld Sir Philip signalling with his purse to me,\nso that Stew might not be privy to it. Entering into the spirit of this,\nI had some pleasant memories of gentlemanly actions done by the superior\nclasses towards me, but longer agone than I could have desired. And now\nbeing out of the habit of it, I showed some natural reluctance to begin\nagain, unless it were really worth my while. Sir Philip understood my\nfeelings, and I rose in his esteem, so that half-guineas went back to\nhis pocket, and guineas took the place of them.\n\n\"Mr Llewellyn, I know,\" he said, \"that you have served your country\nwell; and it grieves me to think that on my account you have met with\nsome harsh words to-day.\"\n\n\"If your worship only knew how little a thing of that sort moves me when\nI think of the great injustice. But I suppose it must be expected by a\npoor man such as I am. Justice Stew is spoiled by having so many rogues\nto deal with. I always make allowance for him; and of course I know that\nhe likes to play with the lofty character I bear. If I had his house and\nhis rich estate--but it does not matter--after all, what are we?\"\n\n\"Ah, you may well say that, Llewellyn. Two months ago I could not have\nbelieved--but who are we to find fault with the doings of our Maker? All\nwill be right if we trust in Him, although it is devilish hard to do.\nBut that poor maid at that wretched place--what is to become of her?\"\n\n\"She has me to look after her, your worship, and she shall not starve\nwhile I have a penny.\"\n\n\"Bravely said, Llewellyn! My son is a sailor, and I understand them. I\nknow that I can trust you fully to take charge of a trifle for her.\"\n\n\"I love the maid,\" I answered truly; \"I would sooner rob myself than\nher.\"\n\n\"Of course you would, after saving her life. I have not time to say much\nto you, only take this trifle for the benefit of that poor thing.\"\n\nFrom a red leathern bag he took out ten guineas, and hastily plunged\nthem into my hand, not wishing Stew to have knowledge of it. But I was\ndesirous that everybody should have the chance to be witness of it, and\nso I held my hand quite open. And just at that moment our Bunny snored.\n\n\"What! have you children yourself, Llewellyn? I thought that you were an\nold bachelor.\"\n\n\"An ancient widower, your worship, with a little grandchild; and how to\nkeep her to the mark, with father none and mother none, quite takes me\noff my head sometimes. Let me light your honour to your carriage.\"\n\n\"Not for a moment, if you please; I wish I had known all this before. Mr\nStew never told me a word of this.\"\n\n\"It would have been strange if he had,\" said I; \"he is always so bitter\nagainst me, because he can never prove anything.\"\n\n\"Then, Llewellyn, you must oblige me. Spend this trifle on clothes and\nthings for that little snorer.\"\n\nHe gave me a little crisp affair, feeling like a child's caul dried, and\nI thought it was no more than that. However I touched my brow and\nthanked him as he went to the carriage-steps; and after consulting all\nthe village, I found it a stanch pledge from the Government for no less\nthan five pounds sterling.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nINTO GOOD SOCIETY.\n\n\nIn spite of all that poor landsmen say about equinoctial gales and so\non, we often have the loveliest weather of all the year in September. If\nthis sets in, it lasts sometimes for three weeks or a month together.\nThen the sky is bright and fair, with a firm and tranquil blue, not so\ndeep of tint or gentle as the blue of spring-tide, but more truly staid\nand placid, and far more trustworthy. The sun, both when he rises over\nthe rounded hills behind the cliffs, and when he sinks into the level of\nthe width of waters, shines with ripe and quiet lustre, to complete a\nyear of labour. As the eastern in the morning, so at sunset the western\nheaven glows with an even flush of light through the entire depth\npervading, and unbroken by any cloud. Then at dusk the dew fog wavers in\nwhite stripes over the meadowland, or in winding combes benighted\npillows down, and leaves its impress a sparkling path for the sun's\nreturn. To my mind no other part of the year is pleasanter than this end\nof harvest, with golden stubble, and orchards gleaming, and the\nhedgerows turning red. Then fish are in season, and fruit is wholesome,\nand the smell of sweet brewing is rich on the air.\n\nThis beautiful weather it was that tempted Colonel Lougher and Lady\nBluett to take a trip for the day to Sker. The distance from Candleston\nCourt must be at least two good leagues of sandy road, or rather of sand\nwithout any road, for a great part of the journey. Therefore, instead of\ntheir heavy coach, they took a light two-wheeled car, and a steady-going\npony, which was very much wiser of them. Also, which was wiser still,\nthey had a good basket of provisions, intending to make a long sea-side\nday, and expecting a lively appetite. I saw them pass through Newton as\nI chanced to be mending my nets by the well; and I touched my hat to the\nColonel of course, and took it off to the lady. The Colonel was driving\nhimself, so as not to be cumbered with any servant; and happening to see\nsuch a basket of food, I felt pretty sure there would be some over, for\nthe quality never eat like us. Then it came into my memory that they\ncould not bear Evan Thomas, and it struck me all of a sudden that it\nmight be well worth my while to happen to meet them upon their return,\nbefore they passed any poor houses, as well as to happen to be swinging\nan empty basket conspicuously. It was a provident thought of mine, and\nturned out as well as its foresight deserved.\n\nThey passed a very pleasant day at Sker (as I was told that evening),\npushing about among rocks and stones, and routing out this, that, and\nthe other, of shells and sea-weed and starfish, and all the rest of the\nrubbish, such as amuses great gentry, because they have nothing to do\nfor their living. And though money is nothing to them, they always seem\nto reckon what they find by money-value. Not Colonel Lougher, of course,\nI mean, and even less Lady Bluett. I only speak of some grand people who\ncome raking along our beach. And of all of these there was nobody with\nthe greediness Anthony Stew had. A crab that had died in changing his\nshell would hardly come amiss to him. Let that pass--who cares about\nhim? I wish to speak of better people. The Colonel, though he could not\nkeep ill-will against any one on earth, did not choose to be indebted to\nSker-grange for even so much as a bite of hay for his pony. Partly,\nperhaps, that he might not appear to play false to his own tenantry; for\nthe Nottage farmers, who held of the Colonel, were always at feud with\nEvan Thomas. Therefore he baited the pony himself, after easing off some\nof the tackle, and moored him to an ancient post in a little sheltered\nhollow. Their rations also he left in the car, for even if any one did\ncome by, none would ever think of touching this good magistrate's\nproperty.\n\nQuite early in the afternoon, their appetites grew very brisk by reason\nof the crisp sea-breeze and sparkling freshness of the waves.\nAccordingly, after consultation, they agreed that the time was come to\nsee what Crumpy, their honest old butler, had put into the basket. The\nColonel held his sister's hand to help her up rough places, and\nbreasting a little crest of rushes, they broke upon a pretty sight,\nwhich made them both say \"hush,\" and wonder.\n\nIn a hollow place of sand, spread with dry white bones, skates' pouches,\nblades of cuttle-fish, sea-snail shells, and all the other things that\nstorm and sea drive into and out of the sands, a very tiny maid was\nsitting, holding audience all alone. She seemed to have no sense at all\nof loneliness or of earthly trouble in the importance of the moment and\nthe gravity of play. Before her sat three little dolls, arranged\naccording to their rank, cleverly posted in chairs of sand. The one in\nthe middle was \"Patty Green,\" the other two strange imitations\nfashioned by young Watkin's knife. Each was urging her claim to shells,\nwhich the mistress was dispensing fairly, and with good advice to each,\nthen laughing at herself and them, and trying to teach them a\nnursery-song, which broke down from forgetfulness. And all the while her\nquick bright face, and the crisp grain of her attitudes, and the jerk of\nher thick short curls, were enough to make any one say, \"What a queer\nlittle soul!\" Therefore it is not to be surprised at that Colonel\nLougher could not make her out, or that while he was feeling about for\nhis eye-glass of best crystal, his sister was (as behoves a female)\nrasher to express opinion. For she had lost a little girl, and sometimes\ngrieved about it still.\n\n\"What a queer little, dear little thing, Henry! I never saw such a\nchild. Where can she have dropped from? Did you see any carriage come\nafter us? It is useless to tell me that she can belong to any of the\npeople about here. Look at her forehead, and look at her manners, and\nhow she touches everything! Now did you see that? What a wonderful\nchild! Every movement is grace and delicacy. Oh, you pretty darling!\"\n\nHer ladyship could wait no longer for the Colonel's opinion (which he\nwas inclined to think of ere he should come out with it), and she ran\ndown the sandhill almost faster than became her dignity. But if she had\nbeen surprised before, how was she astonished now at Bardie's reception\nof her?\n\n\"Don'e tush. Knee tushy paw, see voo pay. All 'e dollies is yae good;\njust going to dinny, and 'e mustn't 'poil their appeties.\"\n\nAnd the little atom arose and moved Lady Bluett's skirt out of her magic\ncircle. And then, having saved her children, she stood scarcely up to\nthe lady's knee, and looked at her as much as to ask, \"Are you of the\nquality?\" And being well satisfied on that point, she made what the lady\ndeclared to be the most elegant curtsy she ever had seen.\n\nMeanwhile the Colonel was coming up, in a dignified manner, and\nleisurely, perceiving no cause to rush through rushes, and knowing that\nhis sister was often too quick. This had happened several times in the\nmatter of beggars and people on crutches, and skin-collectors, and\nsuchlike, who cannot always be kept out of the way of ladies; and his\nworship the Colonel had been compelled to endeavour to put a stop to it.\nTherefore (as the best man in the world cannot in reason be expected to\nbe in a moment abreast with the sallies of even the best womankind, but\nlikes to see to the bottom of it) the Colonel came up crustily.\n\n\"Eleanor, can you not see that the child does not wish for your\ninterference? Her brothers and sisters are sure to be here from Kenfig\nmost likely, or at any rate some of her relations, and busy perhaps with\nour basket.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the child, looking up at him, \"I'se got no 'lations now; all\ngone ayae; but all come back de-morrow day.\"\n\n\"Why, Henry, what are we thinking of? This must be the poor little girl\nthat was wrecked. And I wanted you so to come down and see her; but you\nrefused on account of her being under the care of Farmer Thomas.\"\n\n\"No, my dear, not exactly that, but on account of the trouble in the\nhouse I did not like to appear to meddle.\"\n\n\"Whatever your reason was,\" answered the lady, \"no doubt you were quite\nright; but now I must know more of this poor little thing. Come and have\nsome dinner with us, my darling; I am sure you must be hungry. Don't be\nafraid of the Colonel. He loves little children when they are good.\"\n\nBut poor Bardie hung down her head and was shy, which never happened to\nher with me or any of the common people; she seemed to know, as if by\ninstinct, that she was now in the company of her equals. Lady Bluett,\nhowever, was used to children, and very soon set her quite at ease by\ninviting her dolls, and coaxing them and listening to their histories,\nand all the other little turns that unlock the hearts of innocence. So\nit came to pass that the castaway dined in good society for the first\ntime since her great misfortune. Here she behaved so prettily, and I\nmight say elegantly, that Colonel Lougher (who was of all men the most\nthoroughly just and upright) felt himself bound to confess his error in\ntaking her for a Kenfig nobody. Now, as it happened to be his birthday,\nthe lady had ordered Mr Crumpy, the butler, to get a bottle of the\nchoicest wine, and put it into the hamper without saying anything to the\nColonel, so that she might drink his health, and persuade him to do\nhimself the like good turn. Having done this, she gave the child a drop\nin the bottom of her own wine-glass, which the little one tossed off\nmost fluently, and with a sigh of contentment said--\n\n\"I'se not had a dop of that yiney-piney ever since--sompfin.\"\n\n\"Why, what wine do you call it, my little dear?\" the Colonel asked,\nbeing much amused with her air of understanding it.\n\n\"Doesn't 'a know?\" she replied, with some pity; \"nat's hot I calls a dop\nof good Sam Paine.\"\n\n\"Give her some more,\" said the Colonel; \"upon my word she deserves it.\nEleanor, you were right about her; she is a wonderful little thing.\"\n\nAll the afternoon they kept her with them, being more and more delighted\nwith her as she began to explain her opinions; and Watty, who came to\nlook after her, was sent home with a shilling in his pocket. And some of\nthe above I learned from him, and some from Mr Crumpy (who was a very\ngreat friend of mine), and a part from little Bardie, and the rest even\nfrom her good ladyship, except what trifles I add myself, being gifted\nwith power of seeing things that happen in my absence.\n\nThis power has been in my family for upwards of a thousand years, coming\nout and forming great bards sometimes, and at other times great\nstory-tellers. Therefore let no one find any fault or doubt any single\nthing I tell them concerning some people who happen just now to be five\nor six shelves in the world above me, for I have seen a great deal of\nthe very highest society when I cleaned my Earl's pumps and epaulettes,\nand waited upon him at breakfast; and I know well how those great people\ntalk, not from observation only, but by aid of my own fellow-feeling for\nthem, which, perhaps, owes its power of insight not to my own sagacity\nonly, but to my ancestors' lofty positions, as poets to royal families.\nNow although I may have mentioned this to the man of the Press--whose\nhat appeared to have undergone Press experience--I have otherwise kept\nit quite out of sight, because every writer should hold himself entirely\nround the corner, and discover his hand, but not his face, to as many as\nkindly encourage him. Of late, however, it has been said--not by people\nof our own parish, who have seen and heard me at the well and elsewhere,\nbut by persons with no more right than power to form opinions--that I\ncannot fail of breaking down when I come to describe great people. To\nthese my answer is quite conclusive. From my long connection with\nroyalty, lasting over a thousand years, I need not hesitate to describe\nthe Prince of Wales himself; and inasmuch as His Royal Highness is not\nof pure ancient British descent, I verily doubt whether he could manage\nto better my humble style to my liking.\n\nEnough of that. I felt doubts at beginning, but I find myself stronger\nas I get on. You may rely upon me now to leave the question to your own\nintelligence. The proof of the pudding is in the eating; and if any one\nfears that I cannot cook it, I only beg him to wait and see.\n\nLady Bluett was taken so much with my Bardie, and the Colonel the\nsame--though he tried at first to keep it under--that nothing except\ntheir own warm kindness stopped them from making off with her. The lady\nhad vowed that she would do so, for it would be so much for the little\nsoul's good; and of course, so far as legality went, the Chief-Justice\nof the neighbourhood had more right to her than a common rough farmer.\nBut Watty came down, being sent by Moxy, after he went home with that\nshilling, and must needs make show of it. He came down shyly, from habit\nof nature, to the black eyebrows of the tide, where the Colonel and\nBardie were holding grand play, with the top of the spring running up to\nthem. She was flying at the wink of every wave, and trying to push him\nback into it; and he was laughing with all his heart at her spry ways\nand audacity, and the quickness of her smiles and frowns, and the whole\nof her nature one whirl of play, till he thought nothing more of his\ncoat-tails.\n\n\"What do you want here, boy?\" the Colonel asked, being not best pleased\nthat a man of his standing should be caught in the middle of such\nantics.\n\nWatkin opened his great blue eyes, and opened his mouth as well, but\ncould not get steerage-way on his tongue, being a boy of great\nreverence.\n\n\"Little fellow, what are you come for?\" with these words he smiled on\nthe boy, and was vexed with himself for frightening him.\n\n\"Oh sir, oh sir, if you please, sir, mother says as Miss Delushy must\ncome home to bed, sir.\"\n\n\"'E go ayay now, 'e bad Yatkin! I 'ants more pay with my dear Colonel\nYucca.\"\n\n\"I am not at all sure,\" said the Colonel, laughing, \"that I shall not\nput her into my car, and drive away with her, Watkin.\"\n\n\"You may go home, my good boy, and tell your mother that we have taken\nthis poor little dear to Candleston.\" This, of course, was Lady Bluett.\n\nYou should have seen Watkin's face, they told me, when I came to hear of\nit. Betwixt his terror of giving offence, and his ignorance how to\nexpress his meaning, and the sorrow he felt on his mother's account, and\nperhaps his own pain also, not a word had he to say, but made a grope\nafter the baby's hands. Then the little child ran up to him, and flung\nboth arms around his leg, and showed the stanchness of her breed. Could\nany one, even of six years old, better enter into it?\n\n\"I yoves Yatkin. Yatkin is aye good and kind. And I yoves poor Moky. I\n'ont go ayay till my dear papa and my dear mamma comes for me.\"\n\nLady Bluett, being quick and soft, could not keep her tears from\nstarting; and the Colonel said, \"It must be so. We might have done a\ngreat wrong, my dear. Consider all\"--and here he whispered out of\nWatkin's hearing, and the lady nodded sadly, having known what trouble\nis. But the last words he spoke bravely, \"God has sent her for a comfort\nwhere He saw that it was needed. We must not give way to a passing fancy\nagainst a deep affliction; only we will keep our eyes upon this little\norphan darling.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nSOUND INVESTMENTS.\n\n\nThe spring-tides led me to Sker the next day, and being full early for\nthe ebb, I went in to see what the Colonel had done. For if he should\nhappen to take up the child, she would pass out of my hands altogether,\nwhich might of course be a serious injury, as well as a very great\nhardship. For of Moxy's claim I had little fear if it came to a question\nof title, inasmuch as I had made her sign a document prepared and copied\nby myself, clearly declaring my prior right in virtue of rescue and\nprovidential ordinance. But as against Colonel Lougher I durst not think\nof asserting my claims, even if the law were with me; and not only so;\nbut I felt all along that the matter was not one for money to heal, but\na question of the deepest feelings.\n\nAnd now the way in which Moxy came out, while Bardie was making much of\nme (who always saw everything first, of course), and the style of her\nmeddling in between us, led me to know that a man has no chance to be up\nto the tricks of a female. For the dialogue going on between us was of\nthe very simplest nature, as you may judge by the following:--\n\n\"Hy'se 'a been so long, old Davy, afore 'a come to see poor Bardie?\"\n\n\"Because, my pretty dear, I have been forced to work, all day long\nalmost.\"\n\n\"Hasn't 'a had no time to pay?\"\n\n\"No, my dear, not a moment to play. Work, work, work! Money, money,\nmoney! Till old Davy is quite worn out.\"\n\nI may have put horns to the truth in this. But at any rate not very long\nones. And the child began to ponder it.\n\n\"I tell 'a, old Davy, 'hot to do. Susan say to me one day, kite yell, I\namember, ickle Bardie made of money! Does 'a sink so?\"\n\n\"I think you are made of gold, you beauty; and of diamonds, and the\nRevelations.\"\n\n\"Aye yell! Then I tell 'a hot to do. Take poor Bardie to markiss, old\nDavy; and 'e get a great big money for her.\"\n\nShe must have seen some famous market; for acting everything as she did\n(by means of working face, arms, and legs), she put herself up like a\nfowl in a basket, and spread herself, making the most of her breast, and\nlimping her neck as the dead chickens do. Before I could begin to laugh,\nMoxy was upon us.\n\n\"Dyo! Why for you come again? Never you used to come like this. Put down\nDelushy, directly moment. No fish she is for you to catch. When you\nmight have had her, here you left her through the face of everything.\nAnd now, because great Evan's staff is cloven, by the will of God, who\ntakes not advantage of him? I thought you would have known better, Dyo.\nAnd this little one, that he dotes upon----\"\n\n\"It is enough,\" I answered, with a dignity which is natural to me, when\nfemales wound my feelings; \"Madame Thomas, it is enough. I will quit\nyour premises.\" With these words I turned away, and never looked over my\nshoulder even, though the little one screamed after me; until I felt\nWatty hard under my stern, and like a kedge-anchor dragging. Therefore,\nI let them apologise; till my desire was to forgive them. And after they\nbrought forth proper things, I denied all evil will, and did my best to\naccomplish it.\n\nMrs Thomas returning slowly to her ancient style with me, as I relaxed\nmy dignity, said that now the little maid was getting more at home with\nthem. Mr Thomas, after what had happened in the neighbourhood--this was\nthe death of her five sons--felt naturally low of spirit; and it was\ngood for him to have a lively child around him. He did not seem quite\nwhat he was. And nothing brought him to himself so much as to watch this\nshadow of life; although she was still afraid of him.\n\nEvery word of this was clear to me. It meant ten times what it\nexpressed. Because our common people have a \"height of kindness,\" some\nwould say, and some a \"depth of superstition,\" such as leads them\ndelicately to slope off their meaning. But in my blunt and sailor\nfashion, I said that black Evan must, I feared, be growing rather shaky.\nI had better have kept this opinion quiet; for Moxy bestowed on me such\na gaze of pity mingled with contempt, that knowing what sort of a man he\nhad been, I felt all abroad about everything. All I could say to myself\nwas this, that the only woman of superior mind I ever had the luck to\ncome across, and carefully keep clear of, had taken good care not to\nhave a husband, supposing there had been the occasion. And I think I\nmade mention of her before; because she had been thrice disappointed;\nand all she said was true almost.\n\nHowever, Sker-house might say just what it pleased, while I had my\nwritten document, and \"Delushy\" herself (as they stupidly called her by\ncorruption of Andalusia) was not inclined to abandon me. And now she\nmade them as jealous as could be, for she clung to me fast with one\nhand, while she spread the beautiful tiny fingers of the other to Moxy,\nas much as to say, \"Interrupt me not; I have such a lot of things to\ntell old Davy.\"\n\nAnd so she had without any mistake; and the vast importance of each\nmatter lost nothing for want of emphasis. Patty Green had passed through\na multitude of most surprising adventures, some of them even\ntranscending her larceny of my sugar. Watty had covered himself with\nglory, and above all little \"Dutch,\" the sheep-dog, was now become a\nmost benevolent and protecting power.\n\n\"'Hots 'a think, old Davy? Patty Geen been yecked, she has.\"\n\n\"'Yecked!' I don't know what that is, my dear.\"\n\n\"Ness, I said, 'yecked,' old Davy; yecked down nare, same as Bardie\nwas.\"\n\nIt was clear that she now had taken up with the story which everybody\ntold; and she seemed rather proud of having been wrecked.\n\n\"And Patty,\" she went on, quite out of breath; \"Patty 'poiled all her\nboofely cothes: such a mess 'e never see a'most! And poor Patty go to 'e\nback pit-hole, till 'e boofely Dush yun all into 'e yater.\"\n\n\"Oh, and Dutch pulled her out again, did she?\"\n\n\"Ness, and her head come kite out of her neck. But Yatty put 'e guepot\non, and make it much better than ever a'most.\"\n\n\"Now, Delushy, what a child you are!\" cried Mrs Thomas, proudly; \"you\nnever told Mr. Llewellyn that you ran into the sea yourself, to save\nyour doll; and drownded you must have been, but for our Watkin.\"\n\n\"Bardie 'poil her cothes,\" she said, looking rather shy about it:\n\"Bardie's cothes not boofely now, not same as they used to be.\"\n\nBut if she regretted her change of apparel, she had ceased by this time,\nMoxy said, to fret much for her father and mother. For Watkin, or some\none, had inspired her with a most comforting idea--to wit, that her\nparents had placed her there for the purpose of growing faster; and that\nwhen she had done her best to meet their wishes in this respect, they\nwould suddenly come to express their pride and pleasure at her\nmagnitude. Little brother also would appear in state, and so would\nSusan, and find it needful to ascend the dairy-stool to measure her. As\nat present her curly head was scarcely up to the mark of that stool, the\nduty of making a timely start in this grand business of growing became\nat once self-evident. To be \"a geat big gal\" was her chief ambition;\ninasmuch as \"'hen I'se a geat big gal, mama and papa be so peased, and\nsay, 'hot a good gal 'e is, Bardie, to do as I tell 'a!\"\n\nOften when her heart was heavy in the loneliness of that house, and the\nloss of all she loved, and with dirty things around her, the smile would\ncome back to her thoughtful eyes, and she would open her mouth again for\nthe coarse but wholesome food, which was to make a \"big gal\" of her.\nBelieving herself now well embarked toward this desired magnitude, she\nhad long been making ready for the joy it would secure. \"'E come and\nsee, old Davy. I sow 'a sompfin,\" she whispered to me, when she thought\nthe others were not looking, so I gave a wink to Moxy Thomas, whose\nmisbehaviour I had overlooked, and humouring the child I let her lead me\nto her sacred spot.\n\nThis was in an unused passage, with the end door nailed to jambs, and\nblack oak-panelling along it, and a floor of lias stone. None in the\nhouse durst enter it except this little creature; at least unless there\nwere three or four to hearten one another, and a strong sun shining. The\nAbbot's Walk was its proper name; because a certain Abbot of Neath, who\nhad made too much stir among the monks, received (as we say) his quietus\nthere during a winter excursion; and in spite of all the masses said,\ncould not keep his soul at rest. Therefore his soul came up and down;\nand that is worse than a dozen spirits; for the soul can groan, but the\nspirit is silent.\n\nInto this dark lonely passage I was led by a little body, too newly\ninhabited by spirit to be at all afraid of it. And she came to a\ncupboard door, and tugged, and made a face as usual, when the button was\nhard to move. But as for allowing me to help her,--not a bit of it, if\nyou please. With many grunts and jerks of breath, at last she fetched it\noutward, having made me promise first not to touch, however grand and\ntempting might be the scene disclosed to me.\n\nWhat do you think was there collected, and arranged in such a system\nthat no bee could equal it? Why, every bit of everything that every one\nwho loved her (which amounts to everybody) ever had bestowed upon her,\nfor her own sweet use and pleasure, since ashore she came to us. Not a\nlollipop was sucked, not a bit of \"taffy\" tasted, not a plaything had\nbeen used, but just enough to prove it; all were set in portions four,\ntwo of which were double-sized of what the other two were. Nearly half\nthese things had come, I am almost sure, from Newton; and among the\nchoicest treasures which were stored in scollop shells, I descried one\nof my own buttons which I had honestly given her, because two eyelets\nhad run together; item, a bowl of an unsmoked pipe (which had snapped in\nmy hand one evening); item, as sure as I am alive, every bit of the\nsugar which the Dolly had taken from out my locker.\n\nTimes there are when a hardy man, at sense of things (however childish),\nwhich have left their fibre in him, finds himself, or loses self, in a\nsudden softness. So it almost was with me (though the bait on my hooks\nall the time was drying), and for no better reason than the hopeless\nhopes of a very young child. I knew what all her storehouse meant before\nshe began to tell me. And her excitement while she told me scarcely left\nher breath to speak.\n\n\"'Nat for papa, with 'e kean pipe to 'moke, and 'nat for mamma with 'e\nboofely bucken for her coke, and 'nat for my dear ickle bother, because\nit just fit in between his teeth, and 'nis with 'e 'ooking-gass for\nSusan, because she do her hair all day yong.\"\n\nShe held up the little bit of tin, and mimicked Susan's self-adornment,\nmaking such a comic face, and looking so conceited, that I felt as if I\nshould know her Susan, anywhere in a hundred of women, if only she\nshould turn up so. And I began to smile a little; and she took it up\ntenfold.\n\n\"'E make me yaff so, I do decare, 'e silly old Davy; I doesn't know 'hat\nto do a'most. But 'e mustn't tell anybody.\"\n\nThis I promised, and so went a-fishing, wondering what in the world\nwould become of the queerest fish I had ever caught, as well as the\nhighest-flavoured one. It now seemed a toss-up whether or not something\nor other might turn up, in the course of one's life, about her. At any\nrate she was doing well, with her very bright spirits to help her, and\neven Black Evan, so broken down as not to be hard upon any one. And as\nthings fell out to take me from her, without any warning, upon the whole\nit was for the best to find the last sight comfortable.\n\nAnd a man of my power must not always be poking after babies, even the\nbest that were ever born. Tush, what says King David, who was a\ngreat-grandfather of mine; less distant than Llewellyn Harper, but as\nmuch respected; in spite of his trying to contribute Jewish blood to the\nlot of us in some of his rasher moments? But ancestor though we\nacknowledge him (when our neighbourhood has a revival), I will not be\ncarried away by his fame to copy, so much as to hearken him. The autumn\nnow grew fast upon us, and the beach was shifting; and neither room nor\ntime remained for preaching under the sandhills, even if any one could\nbe found with courage to sit under them. And as the nights turned cold\nand damp, everybody grumbled much; which was just and right enough, in\nbalance of their former grumbling at the summer drought and heat. And it\nwas mainly this desire not to be behind my neighbours in the comfort and\nthe company of grumbling and exchanging grumbles, which involved me in a\ncourse of action highly lowering to my rank and position in society, but\nwithout which I could never have been enabled to tell this story. And\nyet before entering on that subject, everybody will want to know how I\ndischarged my important and even arduous duties as trustee through Sir\nPhilip's munificence for both those little children. In the first place,\nI felt that my position was strictly confidential, and that it would be\na breach of trust to disclose to any person (especially in a loquacious\nvillage) a matter so purely of private discretion. Three parties there\nwere to be considered, and only three, whatever point of view one chose\nto take of it. The first of these was Sir Philip, the second the two\nchildren, and the third of course myself. To the first my duty was\ngratitude (which I felt and emitted abundantly), to the second both zeal\nand integrity; and for myself there was one course only (to which I am\nnaturally addicted), namely, a lofty self-denial. This duty to myself I\ndischarged at once, by forming a stern resolution not to charge either\nof those children so much as a single farthing for taking care of her\nproperty until she was twenty-one years of age. Then as regards the\nsecond point, I displayed my zeal immediately, by falling upon Bunny\nsoon after daylight, and giving her a small-tooth-combing to begin with,\ntill the skin of her hair was as bright as a prawn; after which, without\nany heed whatever of roars, or even kicks, I took a piece of holy-stone,\nand after a rinsing of soda upon her, I cleaned down her planking to\nsuch a degree that our admiral might have inspected her. She was clean\nenough for a captain's daughter before, and dandy-trimmed more than need\nhave been for a little craft built to be only a coaster. But now when\nher yelling had done her good, and her Sunday frock was shipped, and her\nblack hair spanked with a rose-coloured ribbon, and the smiles flowed\ninto her face again with the sense of all this smartness, Sir Philip\nhimself would have thought her consistent with the owner of five pounds\nsterling.\n\nAnd as touching the money itself, and the honesty rightly expected from\nme, although the sum now in my hands was larger than it ever yet had\npleased the Lord to send me, for out and out my own, nevertheless there\nwas no such thing as leading me astray about it. And this was the more\nto my credit, because that power of evil, who has more eyes than all the\nangels put together, or, at any rate, keeps them wider open, he came\naft, seeing how the wind was, and planted his hoof within half a plank\nof the tiller of my conscience. But I heaved him overboard at once, and\nlaid my course with this cargo of gold, exactly as if it were shipper's\nfreight, under bond and covenant. Although, in downright common-sense,\nhaving Bunny for my grandchild, I also possessed beyond any doubt\nwhatever belonged to Bunny; just as the owner of a boat owns the oars\nand rudder also. And the same held true, as most people would think,\nconcerning Bardie's property; for if I had not saved her life, how could\nshe have owned any?\n\nSo far, however, from dealing thus, I not only kept all their money for\nthem, but invested it in the manner which seemed to be most for their\ninterest. To this intent I procured a book for three halfpence (paid out\nof mine own pocket), wherein I declared a partnership, and established a\nfishing association, under the name, style, and description of \"Bardie,\nBunny, Llewellyn, and Co.\" To this firm I contributed not only my\nindustry and skill, but also nets, tackle, rods and poles, hooks and\ncorks, and two kettles for bait, and a gridiron fit to land and cook\nwith; also several well-proven pipes, and a perfectly sound tobacco-box.\nEvery one of these items, and many others, I entered in the ledger of\npartnership; and Mother Jones, being strange to much writing, recorded\nher mark at the bottom of it (one stroke with one hand and one with the\nother), believing it to be my testament, with an Amen coming after it.\n\nBut knowing what the tricks of fortune are, and creditors so\nunreasonable, I thought it much better to keep my boat outside of the\nassociation. If the firm liked, they might hire it, and have credit\nuntil distribution-day, which I fixed for the first day of every three\nmonths. My partners had nothing to provide, except just an anchor, a\nmast, and a lug-sail, a new net or two, because mine were wearing, and\none or two other trifles perhaps, scarcely worth describing. For after\nall, who could be hard upon them, when all they contributed to the firm\nwas fifteen pounds and ten shillings?\n\nIt was now in the power of both my partners to advance towards fortune;\nto permit very little delay before they insisted on trebling their\ncapital; and so reinvest it in the firm; and hence at the age of\ntwenty-one, be fit to marry magistrates. And I made every preparation to\ncarry their shares of the profits over. Nevertheless, things do not\nalways follow the line of the very best and soundest calculations. The\nfish that were running up from the Mumbles, fast enough to wear their\nfins out, all of a sudden left off altogether, as if they had heard of\nthe association. Not even a twopenny glass of grog did I ever take out\nof our capital, nor a night of the week did I lie abed, when the lines\nrequired attendance. However, when fish are entirely absent, the very\nbest fishermen in the world cannot manage to create them; and therefore\nour partnership saw the wisdom of declaring no dividends for the first\nquarter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nA LONG GOOD-BYE.\n\n\nIt is an irksome task for a man who has always stood upon his position,\nand justified the universal esteem and respect of the neighbourhood, to\nhave to recount his own falling off, and loss of proper station, without\nbeing able to render for it any cause or reason, except indeed his own\ngreat folly, with fortune too ready to second it. However, as every\ndownfall has a slope which leads towards it, so in my case small\ndownhills led treacherously to the precipice. In the first place, the\ndog-fish and the sting-rays (which alone came into the nets of our new\nassociation) set me swearing very hard; which, of course, was a trifling\nthing, and must have befallen St Peter himself, whose character I can\nwell understand. But what was wrong in me was this, that after it went\non for a fortnight, and not even a conger turned up, I became proud of\nmy swearing with practice, instead of praying to be forgiven, which I\nalways feel done to me, if desired. For my power of words began to\nplease me--which was a bait of the devil, no doubt--as every tide I felt\nmore and more that married life had not deprived me of my gift of\nlanguage; or, at any rate, that widowership had restored my vigour\npromptly.\n\nAfter this, being a little exhausted, for two days and two nights I\nsmoked pipes. Not in any mood soever unfit for a Christian; quite the\ncontrary, and quite ready to submit to any discipline; being ordered\nalso to lay by, and expect a sign from heaven. And at this time came\nseveral preachers; although I had very little for them, and was grieved\nto disappoint their remembrance of the ham that my wife used to keep in\ncut. And in so many words I said that now I was bound to the Church by a\ncontract of a shilling a-week, and if they waited long enough, they\nmight hear the clock strike--something. This, combined with a crab whose\nsubstance had relapsed to water, and the sign of nothing in my locker\nexcept a pint of peppermint, induced these excellent pastors to go; and\nif they shook off (as they declared) the dirt of their feet at me, it\nmust have been much to their benefit. This trifle, however, heaped up my\ngrievance, although I thought scorn to think of it; and on the back of\nit there came another wrong far more serious. Tidings, to wit, of a\nwretched warrant being likely to issue against me from that low tyrant\nAnthony Stew, on a thoroughly lying information by one of his own\ngamekeepers. It was true enough that I went through his wood, with a\ncouple of sailors from Porthcawl; by no means with any desire to harm,\nbut to see if his game was healthy. Few things occur that exalt the mind\nmore than natural history; and if a man dare not go into a wood, how can\nhe be expected to improve his knowledge? Tho other men perhaps employed\ntheir means to obtain a more intimate acquaintance with the structure\nand methods of various creatures, going on two legs, or going on four;\nbut as for myself, not so much as a gun did any one see in my hands that\nday.\n\nAt first I thought of standing it out on the strength of all my glory;\nbut knowing what testimony is, when it gets into the mouths of\ngamekeepers, and feeling my honour concerned, to say nothing of the\nother fellows (who were off to sea), also cherishing much experience of\nthe way Stew handled me, upon the whole I had half a mind to let the\nneighbourhood and the county learn to feel the want of me.\n\nAlso what Joe Jenkins said perhaps had some effect on me. This was a\nyoung fellow of great zeal, newly appointed to Zoar Chapel, instead of\nthe steady Nathaniel Edwards, who had been caught sheep-stealing; and\ninasmuch as the chapel stood at the western end of the village, next\ndoor to the \"Welcome to Town, my Lads,\" all the maids of Newton ran\nmightily to his doctrine. For he happened to be a smart young fellow,\nand it was largely put abroad that an uncle of his had a butter-shop,\nwithout any children, and bringing in four pounds a-week at Chepstow.\n\nThere is scarcely a day of my life on which I do not receive a lesson:\nand the difference betwixt me and a fool is that I receive, and he\nscorns it. And a finer lesson I have rarely had than for letting Joe\nJenkins into my well-conducted cottage, for no better reason than that\nthe \"Welcome to Town\" was out of beer. I ought to have known much\nbetter, of course, with a fellow too young to shave himself, and myself\na good hearty despiser of schism, and above all having such a fine\nconnection with the Church of England. But that fellow had such a\ntongue--they said it must have come out of the butter. I gave him a\nglass of my choicest rum, when all he deserved was a larruping. And I\nnearly lost the church-clock through it.\n\nWhen I heard of this serious consequence, I began to call to mind, too\nlate, what the chaplain of the Spitfire--32-gun razy--always used to say\nto us; and a finer fellow to stand to his guns, whenever it came to\nclose quarters, I never saw before or since. \"Go down, parson, go down,\"\nwe said; \"sir, this is no place for your cloth.\" \"Sneaking schismatics\nmay skulk,\" he answered, with the powder-mop in his hand; for we had\nimpressed a Methody, who bolted below at exceeding long range; \"but if\nmy cloth is out of its place, I'll fight the devil naked.\" This won over\nto the side of the Church every man of our crew that was gifted with any\nperception of reasoning.\n\nHowever, I never shall get on if I tell all the fine things I have seen.\nOnly I must set forth how I came to disgrace myself so deeply that I\ncould not hope for years and years to enjoy the luxury of despising so\nmuch as a lighterman again. The folk of our parish could hardly believe\nit; and were it to be done in any way consistent with my story, I would\nnot put it on paper now. But here it is. Make the worst of it. You will\nfind me redeem it afterwards. The famous David Llewellyn, of His\nMajesty's Royal Navy, took a berth in a trading-schooner, called the\n\"Rose of Devon!\"\n\nAfter such a fall as this, if I happened to speak below my mark, or not\ndescribe the gentry well, everybody must excuse me: for I went so low in\nmy own esteem, that I could not have knocked even Anthony Stew's\nunder-keeper down! I was making notes, here and there, already,\nconcerning the matters at Sker House, and the delicate sayings of\nBardie, not with any view to a story perfect and clear as this is, but\nfor my own satisfaction in case of anything worth going on with. And but\nfor this forethought, you could not have learned both her sayings and\ndoings so bright as above. And now being taken away from it, I tried to\nfind some one with wit enough to carry it on in my absence. In a\npopulous neighbourhood this might have been; but the only man near us\nwho had the conceit to try to carry it on a bit, fell into such a\ncondition of mind that his own wife did not know him. But in spite of\nthe open state of his head, he held on very stoutly, trying to keep\nhimself up to the mark with ale, and even Hollands; until it pleased God\nthat his second child should fall into the chicken-pox; and then all the\nneighbours spoke up so much--on account of his being a tailor--that it\ncame to one thing or the other. Either he must give up his trade, and\nlet his apprentice have it--to think of which was worse than gall and\nwormwood to his wife--or else he must give up all meddling with pen and\nink and the patterns of chicken-pox. How could he hesitate, when he knew\nthat the very worst tailor can make in a day as much as the best writer\ncan in a month?\n\nUpon the whole I was pleased with this; for I never could bear that\nrogue of a snip, any more than he could put up with me for making my own\nclothes and Bunny's. I challenged him once on a buttonhole, for I was\nhis master without a thimble. And for this ninth part of a man to think\nof taking up my pen!\n\nThe name of our schooner, or rather ketch--for she was no more than that\n(to tell truth), though I wished her to be called a \"schooner\"--was, as\nI said, the \"Rose of Devon,\" and the name of her captain was \"Fuzzy.\"\nNot a bad man, I do believe, but one who almost drove me wicked, because\nI never could make him out. A tender and compassionate interest in the\naffairs of everybody, whom it pleases Providence that we should even\nhear of, has been (since our ancestors baffled the Flood, without\nconsulting Noah) one of the most distinct and noblest national traits of\nWelshmen. Pious also; for if the Lord had not meant us to inquire, He\nnever would have sent us all those fellow-creatures to arouse unallayed\ndisquietude. But this man \"Fuzzy,\" as every one called him, although his\ntrue name was \"Bethel Jose,\" seemed to be sent from Devonshire for the\nmere purpose of distracting us. Concerning the other two\n\"stone-captains\" (as we call those skippers who come for limestone, and\nsteal it from Colonel Lougher's rocks), we knew as much as would keep us\ngoing whenever their names were mentioned; but as to Fuzzy, though this\nwas the third year of his trading over, there was not a woman in Newton\nwho knew whether he had a wife or not! And the public eagerness over\nthis subject grew as the question deepened; until there were seven of\nour best young women ready to marry him, at risk of bigamy, to find out\nthe matter and to make it known.\n\nTherefore, of course, he rose more and more in public esteem, voyage\nafter voyage; and I became jealous, perhaps, of his fame, and resolved\nto expose its hollow basis, as compared with that of mine. Accordingly,\nwhen it came to pass that my glory, though still in its prime, was\nimperilled by that Irish Stew's proceedings--for he must have been Irish\nby origin--having my choice (as a matter of course) among the three\nstone captains, I chose that very hard stone to crack; and every one\nall through the village rejoiced, though bitterly grieved to lose me,\nand dreading the price there would be for fish, with that extortionate\nSandy Macraw left alone to create a monopoly. There was not a man in all\nNewton that feared to lay half-a-crown to a sixpence that I brought back\nthe whole of old Fuzzy's concerns: but the women, having tried Skipper\nJose with everything they could think of, and not understanding the odds\nof betting, were ready to lay a crooked sixpence on Fuzzy, whenever they\nhad one.\n\nTo begin with, he caught me on the hop; at a moment of rumours and\nserious warnings, and thoroughly pure indignation on my part. At the\nmoment, I said (and he made me sign) that I was prepared to ship with\nhim. After which he held me fast, and frightened me with the land-crabs,\nand gave me no chance to get out of his jaws. I tried to make him laugh\nwith some of the many jokes and stories, which everybody knows of mine,\nand likes them for long acquaintance' sake. However, not one of them\nmoved him so much as to fetch one squirt of tobacco-juice. This alone\nenabled him to take a strong lead over me. Every time that he was bound\nto laugh, according to human nature, and yet had neither a wag in his\nnose, nor a pucker upon his countenance, nor even so much as a gleam in\nhis eye, so many times I felt in my heart that this man was the wise\nman, and that laughter is a folly. And I had to bottle down the laughs\n(which always rise inside of me, whenever my joke has the cream on it)\nuntil I could find some other fellow fit to understand me; because I\nknew that my jokes were good.\n\nWhen I found no means of backing out from that degrading contract, my\nvery first thought was to do strict justice to our association, and\natone for the loss of my services to it. Therefore, in case of anything\nundesirable befalling me--in short, if I should be ordered aloft with no\nleave to come down again--there I made my will, and left my property to\nestablish credit, for a new start among them. Chairs and tables, knives\nand forks, iron spoons, brought into the family by my wife's\ngrandfather, several pairs of duds of my own, and sundry poles, as\nbefore described, also nets to a good extent--though some had gone under\nusury--bait-kettles, I forget how many, and even my character in a\nsilk-bag; item, a great many sundry things of almost equal value; the\nwhole of which I bravely put into my will, and left them. And knowing\nthat the proper thing is to subscribe a codicil, therein I placed a set\nof delf, and after that my blessing. Eighteenpence I was compelled to\npay for this pious document to a man who had been turned out of the law\nbecause he charged too little. And a better shilling-and-sixpence worth\nof sense, with heads and tails to it, his lordship the Bishop of\nLlandaff will own that he never set seal upon; unless I make another\none. Only I felt it just to leave my boat entire to Bardie.\n\nHaving done my duty thus, I found a bracing strength upon me to go\nthrough with everything. No man should know how much I felt my violent\ndegradation from being captain of a gun, to have to tread mercantile\nboards! Things have changed since then so much, through the parsimony of\nGovernment, that our very best sailors now tail off into the Merchant\nservice. But it was not so, when I was young; and even when I was turned\nof fifty, we despised the traders. Even the largest of their vessels, of\nfour or as much as five hundred tons, we royal tars regarded always as\nso many dust-bins with three of the clothes-props hoisted. And now, as I\nlooked in the glass, I beheld no more than the mate of a fifty-ton\nketch, for a thirty-mile voyage out of Newton bay!\n\nHowever, I had lived long enough then to be taught one simple thing.\nWhatever happens, one may descry (merely by using manly aspect) dawning\nglimpses of that light which the will of God intended to be joy for all\nof us; but so scattered now and vapoured by our own misdoings, still it\nwill come home some time, and then we call it \"comfort.\"\n\nAccordingly, though so deeply fallen in my own regard, I did not find\nthat people thought so very much the less of me. Nay, some of them even\ndrove me wild, by talking of my \"rise in life,\" as if I had been a pure\nnobody! But on the whole we learned my value, when I was going away from\nus. For all the village was stirred up with desire to see the last of\nme. My well-known narratives at the well would be missed all through the\nautumn; and those who had dared to call them \"lies,\" were the foremost\nto feel the lack of them. Especially the children cried \"Old Davy going\nto be drownded! No more stories at the well!\" Until I vowed to be back\nalmost before they could fill their pitchers.\n\nThese things having proved to me, in spite of inordinate modesty, that I\nhad a certain value, I made the very best of it; and let everybody know\nhow much I wished to say \"Good-bye\" to them, although so short of money.\nFrom \"Felix Farley\" I had received no less than seven-and-tenpence--for\nsaving the drowned black people--under initials \"D. L.\" at the office;\naccruing to a great extent from domestic female servants. Some of these\ncraved my candid opinion as to accepting the humble addresses of\ncoloured gentlemen in good livery, and whether it made so much\ndifference. And now I thought that Newton might have a mark of esteem\nprepared for me.\n\nBut though they failed to think of that--purely from want of\nexperience--everything else was done that could be done for a man who\nhad no money, by his neighbours who had less; and sixpence never entered\ntwice into the thoughts of any one. Richard Matthews, the pilot,\npromised to mind the church-clock for me, without even handling my\nsalary. As for Bunny, glorification is the shortest word I know. A young\nman, who had never paid his bill, put her into two-inch ribbon from the\nBaptist preacher's shop. Also a pair of shoes upon her, which had right\nand left to them, although not marked by nature. And upon the front of\nher bosom, lace that made me think of smuggling; and such as that young\nman never could have expected to get booked to him, if he had felt\nhimself to be more than a month converted.\n\nMoreover, instead of Mother Jones (who was very well in her way, to be\nsure), the foremost folk in all the village, and even Master Charles\nMorgan himself, carpenter and churchwarden, were beginning to vie, one\nwith the other, in desire to entertain her, without any word of her\nfive-pound note. In short, many kind things were said and done; enough\nto make any unbashful man desire to represent them. But I, for my part,\nwas quite overcome, and delivered my speech with such power of doubt\nconcerning my own worthiness, that they had to send back to the inn\nthree times, before they could properly say \"Good-bye.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nBRAUNTON BURROWS.\n\n\nThe weather was still as fair as could be, with a light wind from the\neast-north-east; and as our course lay west by south, and the ebb was\nrunning, we slipped along at the rate of six or seven knots an hour,\nthough heavily-laden with the Colonel's rocks; and after rounding\nPorthcawl Point we came abreast of the old Sker House a little after\nsunset. Skipper Jose would never have ventured inside the Sker-weathers,\nonly that I held the tiller, and knew every vein of sand and rock. And I\nkept so close in shore, because one of the things that vexed me most in\nall this sudden departure, was to run away without proper ceremony from\nBardie. She was certain to feel it much, and too young to perceive the\nnecessity; and fried pudding had been promised her at my table come the\nvery next Sunday.\n\nThe windows of the old grey mansion gleamed in the fading western light,\nbut we descried no smoke or movement, neither any life or variance, only\na dreary pile of loneliness in the middle of yellow sands. Then I rigged\nout my perspective glass, and levelled it on the cuddy chimney--for the\nketch was a half-decker--to spy if the little one might so chance to be\nmaking her solitary play, as she was used to do all day, and most of all\nere bedtime. And if she should so happen, I knew how wild her delight\nwould be to discover a vessel so near the shore; because whenever a sail\nwent by, even at two or three leagues of distance, there was no\ncontaining her. Out she would rush with her face on fire, and curly hair\nall jogging, and up would go two little hands, spread to the sky and the\nvast wide sea. \"Mammy dear, I 'ants 'a so. Dear papa, I has yaited so\nyong. Ickle bother, such a lot of things Bardie's got to tell 'a.\" And\nthus she would run on the brink of the waves with hope and sadness\nfluctuating on her unformed countenance, until the sail became a speck.\nHowever, now I saw no token of this little rover, unless it were some\nwashed clothes flapping on the rushen tufts to dry; and Jose called me\nback to my spell at the helm before I had finished gazing. And in less\nthan half an hour the landmark of the ancient house was fading in the\ndew-fog.\n\nOur ship's company amounted to no less than four, all hands told--viz.,\nCaptain Bethel Jose, _alias_ Fuzzy; Isaac Hutchings, the mate; my humble\nself (who found it my duty to supersede Ikey and appoint myself); and a\nboy of general incapacity, and of the name of \"Bang.\"\n\nMaking fine weather as we did, and with myself at the helm all night,\nand taking command (as my skill required), we slanted across Channel\nvery sweetly; and when the grey of morning broke, Lundy Isle was on our\nlee-bow. Hereupon I gave the helm to old Ike, for beyond this was\nunknown to me, and Providence had never led me over Barnstaple bar as\nyet. So I tumbled in, and turned up no more until we were close on the\nbar itself, about ten o'clock of the forenoon. This is a thoroughly\ndangerous place, a meeting of treacherous winds and waters, in amongst\nuncertain shoaling, and would be worse than our Sker-weathers if it lay\nopen to south-west gales. We waited for the tide, and then slipped over\nvery cleverly, with Hartland Point on our starboard beam; and presently\nwe found ourselves in a fine broad open water, with plenty of grey\nstretch going along it, and green hills tufting away from it. Everything\nlooked so mild and handsome, that I wondered whether these men of\nDevonshire might not be such fools for bragging after all, when tested.\n\nBecause, when I found no means to escape this degrading voyage to\nDevonshire, I had said to myself that at any rate it would enable me to\npeg down those people for the future. Not that they boasted, so to\nspeak, but that they held their tongues at our boasts; as much as to\nsay, \"You may talk if you please; it does you good; and our land is such\nthat we never need contradict you.\"\n\nBut now when I saw these ins and outs, and ups and downs, and cornering\nplaces, and the wrinkles of the valleys, and the cheeks of the very\nrocks, set with green as bright and lively (after a burning summer) as\nour own country can show in May, I began to think--though I would not\nsay it, through patriotic unwillingness--that the people who lived in\nsuch land as this could well afford to hold their tongues, and hearken\nour talk with pleasure. Captain Fuzzy said no word, to show that he was\nhome again; neither did he care to ask my opinion about the look of it.\nAnd old Ike treating me likewise, though he ought to have known much\nbetter, there I found myself compelled by my natural desire to know all\nabout my fellow-creatures, to carry on what must have been a most highly\nflattering patronage towards the boy who did our slop-work, and whose\nname was \"Bang,\" because everybody banged him.\n\nThis boy, forgetting the respect which is due to the mate of a ship of\ncommerce--for I now assumed that position legally, over the head of old\nIkey, who acknowledged my rank when announced to him--this ignorant boy\nhad the insolence to give me a clumsy nudge, and inquire--\n\n\"Du 'e knaw thiccy peart over yanner? Them down-plasses, and them zandy\nbacks?\"\n\n\"My boy,\" I replied, \"I have not the honour of knowing anything about\nthem. Very likely you think a good deal of them.\"\n\n\"Whai, thee must be a born vule. Them be Braunton Burrusses!\"\n\n\"Be them indeed? Take this, my boy, for such valuable information.\" And\nI gave him a cuff of an earnest nature, such as he rarely obtained,\nperhaps, and well calculated to be of timely service to him. He howled a\ngood bit, and attempted to kick; whereupon I raised him from his natural\nlevel, and made his head acquainted with the nature of the foremast,\npreserving my temper quite admirably, but bearing in mind the great\nimportance of impressing discipline at an early age. And I reaped a\nwell-deserved reward in his lifelong gratitude and respect.\n\nWhile Bang went below to complete his weeping, and to find some plaster,\nI began to take accurate observation of these Braunton Burrows, of which\nI had often heard before from the Devonshire men, who frequent our coast\nfor the purpose of stealing coal or limestone. An up-and-down sort of a\nplace it appeared, as I made it out with my spy-glass; and I could not\nperceive that it beat our sands, as those good people declared of it.\nOnly I noticed that these sandhills were of a different hue from ours.\nNot so bare and yellow-faced, not so swept by western winds, neither\nwith their tops thrown up like the peak of a new volcano. Rushes,\nspurge, and goose-foot grasses, and the rib-leafed iris, and in hollow\nplaces cat's-mint, loose-strife, and low eye-bright--these and a\nthousand other plants seemed to hold the flaky surface so as not to fly\nlike ours. Ike broke silence, which to him was worse than breaking his\nown windows, and said that all for leagues around was full of giants and\ngreat spectres. Moreover, that all of it long had been found an unkid\nand unholy place, bad for a man to walk in, and swarming with great\ncreatures, striped the contrary way to all good-luck, and having eight\nlegs every side, and a great horn crawling after them. And their food\nall night was known to be travellers' skulls and sailors' bones. Having\nseen a good deal of land-crabs, I scarcely dared to deny the story, and\nyet I could hardly make it out. Therefore, without giving vent to\nopinions of things which might turn out otherwise, I levelled my\nspy-glass again at the region of which I had heard such a strange\naccount. And suddenly here I beheld a man of no common appearance,\nwandering in and out the hollows, as if he never meant to stop; a tall\nman with a long grey beard, and wearing a cocked-hat like a colonel.\nThere was something about him that startled me, and drew my whole\nattention. Therefore, with my perspective glass not long ago cleaned,\nand set ship-shape by a man who understood the bearings--after that\nrogue of a Hezekiah had done his best to spoil it--with this honest\nmagnifier (the only one that tells no lies) I carefully followed up and\ndown the figure, some three cables'-lengths away, of this strange walker\namong the sandhills. We were in smooth water now, gliding gently up the\nriver, with the mainsail paying over just enough for steerage-way; and\nso I got my level truly, and could follow every step.\n\nIt was a fine old-fashioned man, tall and very upright, with a broad\nribbon upon his breast, and something of metal shining; and his Hessian\nboots flashed now and then as he passed along with a stately stride. His\nbeard was like a streak of silver, and his forehead broad and white; but\nall the rest of his face was dark, as if from foreign service. His dress\nseemed to be of a rich black velvet, very choice and costly, and a long\nsword hung at his side, although so many gentlemen now have ceased to\ncarry even a rapier. I like to see them carry their swords--it shows\nthat they can command themselves; but what touched me most with feeling\nwas his manner of going on. He seemed to be searching, ever searching,\nup the hills and down the hollows, through the troughs and on the\nbreastlands, in the shadow and the sunlight, seeking for some precious\nloss.\n\nAfter watching this figure some little time, it was natural that I\nshould grow desirous to know something more about him; especially as I\nobtained an idea, in spite of the distance and different dress, that I\nhad seen some one like this gentleman not such a very long time ago. But\nI could not recall to my mind who it was that was hovering on the skirts\nof it; therefore I looked around for help. Ike Hutchings, my under-mate,\nwas at the tiller, but I durst not lend him my glass, because he knew\nnot one end from the other; so I shouted aloud for Captain Jose, and\nbegged him to take a good look, and tell me everything that he knew or\nthought. He just set his eye, and then shut up the glass, and handed it\nto me without a word and walked off, as if I were nobody! This vexed me,\nso that I holloaed out: \"Are all of you gone downright mad on this side\nof the Channel? Can't a man ask a civil question, and get a civil\nanswer?\"\n\n\"When he axeth what consarneth him,\" was the only answer Captain Fuzzy\nvouchsafed me over his shoulder.\n\nI could not find it worth my while to quarrel with this ignorant man for\nthe sake of a foolish word or two, considering how morose he was, and\nkept the keys of everything. For the moment, I could not help regretting\nmy wholesome chastisement of the boy Bang; for he would have told me at\nleast all he knew, if I could have taught him to take a good look. And\nas for Ike, when I went and tried him, whether it was that he failed of\nmy meaning, or that he chose to pretend to do so (on account of my\nhaving deposed him), or that he truly knew nothing at all--at any rate,\nI got nothing from him. This was, indeed, a heavy trial. It is\nacknowleged that we have such hearts, and strength of goodwill to the\nuniverse, and power of entering into things, that not a Welshman of us\nis there but yearns to know all that can be said about every one he has\never seen, or heard, or even thought of. And this kind will, instead of\nbeing at all repressed by discouragement, increases tenfold in\nproportion as others manifest any unkind desire to keep themselves out\nof the way of it. My certy, no low curiosity is this, but lofty\nsympathy.\n\nMy grandfather nine generations back, Yorath the celebrated bard, begins\nperhaps his most immortal ode to a gentleman who had given him a quart\nof beer with this noble moral precept: \"Lift up your eyes to the castle\ngates and behold on how small a hinge they move! The iron is an inch and\na quarter thick, the gates are an hundred and fifty feet wide!\" And\nthough the gates of my history are not quite so wide as that, they often\nmove on a hinge even less than an inch and a quarter in thickness;\nthough I must not be too sure, of course, as to the substance of Bang's\nhead. However, allow even two inches for it, and it seems but a very\ntrifling matter to tell as it did upon great adventures. The boy was as\nsound as a boy need be in a couple of hours afterwards, except that he\nhad, or pretended to have, a kind of a buzzing in one ear; and I found\nhim so grateful for my correction, that I could not bear to urge his\nhead with inquiries for the moment.\n\nTo Captain Fuzzy I said no more. If he could not see the advantage of\nattending to his own business, but must needs go out of his way to\nadminister public reproof to me, I could only be sorry for him. To Ikey,\nhowever, I put some questions of a general tendency; but from his\nbarbarous broken English--if this jargon could be called English at\nall--the only thing I could gather was, that none but true Devonshire\nfolk had a right to ask about Devonshire families. This might be true\nto a certain extent, though I never have seen such a law laid down. The\nanswer, however, is perfectly simple. If these people carry on in a\nmanner that cannot fail to draw public attention, they attack us at once\non our tenderest point, and tenfold so if they are our betters; for what\nman of common-sense could admit the idea of anybody setting up to be\nnobody? Therefore I felt myself quite ready to give a week's pay and\nvictuals, in that state of life to which God alone could have seen fit\nto call me--as mate of that Devonshire ketch, or hoy, or tub, or\nwhatever it might be--four shillings and a bag of suet-dumplings, twice\na-day, I would have given, to understand upon the spot all about that\nelderly gentleman.\n\nIt helped me very little, indeed, that I kept on saying to myself, \"This\nmatters not; 'tis a few hours only. The moment we get to Barnstaple, I\nshall find some women;--the women can never help telling everything, and\nfor the most part ten times that. Only contradict them bravely, and they\nhave no silence left.\" However, it helped me not a little when Captain\nFuzzy, with a duck of his head, tumbled up from the cuddy, brimful, as\nwe saw, of the dinner-time. A man of my experience, who has lived for\nsix weeks on the horns of sea-snails, which the officers found too hard\nfor them, that time we were wrecked in the Palamede--what can a man of\nthis kind feel when a trumpery coaster dares to pipe all hands to\ndinner?\n\nHowever, it so happened for the moment that what I felt was appetite:\nand Fuzzy, who was a first-rate cook, and knew seasoning without\ncounting, had brought an iron ladle up, so as to save his words, and yet\nto give us some idea. Soup it was of a sort, that set us thinking of all\nthe meat under it. I blew upon it, and tasted a drop, and found that\nother people's business would keep till at least after dinner. In the\nmidst of dinner we came to the meeting of two fine rivers, called Tawe\nand Torridge, and with the tide still making strong we slanted up the\nformer. The channel was given to twists and turns, but the fine open\nvalley made up for it, and the wealth of land on either side, sloping\nwith green meadows gently, and winding in and out with trees. Here were\ncattle, as red as chesnuts, running about with tails like spankers, such\nas I never saw before; but Ikey gave me to understand that the colour of\nthe earth was the cause of it, and that if I lived long upon corned beef\nmade of them (whose quality no other land could create), I should be\nturned to that hue myself. At this I laughed, as a sailor's yarn; but\nafter regarding him steadfastly, and then gazing again at the bullocks,\nI thought there might be some truth in it.\n\nOne thing I will say of these sons of Devon: rough they may be, and\nshort of grain, and fond of their own opinions, and not well up in\npoints of law--which is our very nature--queer, moreover, in thought and\nword, and obstinate as hedgehogs,--yet they show, and truly have, a kind\ndesire to feed one well. Money they have no great love of spending round\nthe corner, neither will they go surety freely for any man who is free\nto run; but \"vittels,\" as they call them, \"vittels!\"--before you have\nbeen in a house two minutes out come these, and eat you must! Happily,\nupon this point I was able to afford them large and increasing\nsatisfaction, having rarely enjoyed so fine a means of pleasing myself\nand others also. For the things are good, and the people too; and it\ntakes a bad man to gainsay either.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nA FINE SPECTACLE.\n\n\nWe brought the Rose of Devon to her moorings on the south side of the\nriver, about two miles short of Barnstaple, where a little bend and\ncreek is, and a place for barges, and \"Deadman's Pill\" was the name of\nit. What could a dead man want with a pill, was the very first thing I\nasked them; but they said that was no concern of theirs; there were\npills up and down the river for miles, as well as a town called\nPill-town. The cleverest man that I came across said that it must be by\nreason of piles driven in where the corners were to prevent the washing,\nand he showed me some piles, or their stumps, to prove it, and defied\nall further argument. For the time I was beaten, until of a sudden, and\ntoo late to let him know, I saw like a stupid that it must be no other\nthan our own word \"Pwll,\" which differs much from an English \"pool,\"\nbecause it may be either dry or wet, so long as it lies in a hollow. And\nwith that I fell a-thinking of poor Bardie and Pwll Tavan. To be quit of\nremorse, and to see the world, I accepted old Ikey's invitation to\nBarnstaple fair for the very next day. We could not begin to discharge\nour limestone, as even that obstinate Fuzzy confessed, upon a sacred day\nlike that. Fuzzy himself had a mind for going, as we half suspected,\nalthough he held his tongue about it; and my under-mate told me to let\nhim alone, and see what would come of it.\n\nThe town is a pleasant and pretty one, and has always been famous for\nthinking itself more noble than any other; also the fair was a fine\nthing to see, full of people, and full of noise, and most outrageous\ndialect; everybody in fine broad humour, and no fighting worth even\nlooking at. This disappointed me; for in Wales we consider the off-day\nmarket a poor one, unless at least some of the women pull caps. I tried,\nhowever, not to miss it, having seen in foreign countries people meeting\npeaceably. Of this I could have had no intention to complain to poor\nIkey Hutchings. However, he took it as if I had, and offered to find me\na man from Bratton, or himself, to have a square with me, and stake\nhalf-a-crown upon it. He must have found early cause for repentance, if\nI had taken him at his word; but every one would have cried shame upon\nme against such a poor little fellow. And so we pushed on, and the\npeople pushed us.\n\nAfter a little more of this, and Ikey bragging all the time, though I\nsaw nothing very wonderful, we turned the corner of a narrow street, and\nopened into a broader one. Here there seemed to be no bullocks, such as\nhad made us keep springs on our cables, but a very amazing lot of\nhorses, trotting about, and parading, and rushing, most of them with\ntheir tails uphoisted, as if by discharging tackle. Among them stood\nmen, making much of their virtues, and sinking their faults (if they had\nany), and cracking a whip every now and then, with a style of applause\ntoward them.\n\nNow I have a natural love of the horse, though I never served long on\nboard of one; and I regularly feel, at sight of them, a desire to mount\nthe rigging. Many a time I have reasoned to my own conviction and my\nneighbours', that a man who can stand on the mizzen-top-gallant yard in\na heavy gale of wind, must find it a ridiculously easy thing to hold on\nby a horse with the tackle to help him, and very likely a dead calm all\nround. Nevertheless, somehow or other, the result seems always\notherwise.\n\nI had just hailed a man with a colt to show off, and commodore's\npendants all over his tail, and was keeping clear of his counter to\ncatch the rise of the wave for boarding him, when a hush came over all\nhands as if the street had been raked with chain-shot. And on both sides\nof the street all people fell back and backed their horses, so that all\nthe roadway stood as clear as if the fair had turned into a Sunday\nmorning.\n\nUp the centre, and heeding the people no more than they would two rows\nof trees, came two grave gentlemen, daintily walking arm in arm, and\ndressed in black. They had broad-flapped hats, long coats of broadcloth,\nblack silk tunics, and buckled breeches, and black polished boots\nreaching up to the buckles.\n\nMeanwhile all the people stood huddled together upon the pitched stones\non either side, touching their hats, and scarce whispering, and even the\nshowing off of the horses went into the side-streets.\n\nAfter all the bowing and legging that I had beheld in the Royal Navy,\nthe double file, the noble salutes, the manning of the sides and yards,\nthe drums, the oars all upon the catch, and all the other glorious\nthings that fit us to thrash the Frenchmen so, there was nothing else\nleft for me to suppose but that here were two mighty admirals, gone into\nmourning very likely for the loss of the Royal George, or come on the\nsly perhaps to enjoy the rollicking of the fair, and sinking the uniform\nfor variety. How could I tell, and least of all would I think of\ninterfering with the pleasure of my betters; therefore I stopped in my\nthroat the cheer (which naturally seemed to rise the moment I took my\nhat off), for fear of letting the common people know that I understood\ntheir Honours. But after looking again so long as one might without\nbeing inquisitive, I saw that neither of these great men could walk the\ndeck in a rolling sea.\n\nI had been so bold in the thick of the horses, that Ikey had found it\ntoo much for him always to keep close to me; but now, as the nearest\nhorse must have drifted the length of two jolly-boats away, this little\nsailor came up and spoke.\n\n\"Can 'e show the laikes of they two, in Taffy-land, old Taffy now?\"\n\n\"Plenty, I should hope,\" said I (though proud in the end to say \"not\none\"); \"but what a fuss you make! Who are they?\"\n\n\"As if thee didn't know!\" cried Ikey, staring with indignation at me.\n\n\"How should I know when I never clapped eyes on either of them till this\nmoment?\"\n\n\"Thou hast crossed the water for something then, Davy. Them be the two\nPassons!\"\n\n\"Two Passons!\" I could not say it exactly as he sounded it. \"I never\nheard of two Passons.\"\n\n\"'A wants to draive me mad, 'a dooth,\" said Ikey, in self-commune: \"Did\n'e never hear tell of Passon Chowne, and Passon Jack, man alive now?\"\n\nIt was hopeless to try any more with him, for I could not ding into his\nstupid head the possibility of such ignorance. He could only believe\nthat I feigned it for the purpose of driving him out of his senses, or\nmaking little of his native land. So I felt that the best thing I could\ndo was to look at those two great gentlemen accurately and impartially,\nand thus form my own opinion. Hence there was prospect of further\npleasure, in coming to know more about them.\n\nVerily they were goodly men, so far as the outer frame goes; the one for\nsize, and strength, and stature--and the other for face, form, and\nquickness. I felt as surely as men do feel, who have dealed much among\nother men, that I was gazing upon two faces not of the common order. And\nthey walked as if they knew themselves to be ever so far from the\naverage. Not so much with pride, or conceit, or any sort of arrogance,\nbut with a manner of going distinct from the going of fellow-creatures.\nWhether this may have been so, because they were both going straight to\nthe devil, is a question that never crossed my mind, until I knew more\nabout them. For our parsons in Wales, take them all in all, can hardly\nbe called gentlemen; except, of course, our own, who was Colonel\nLougher's brother, also the one at Merthyr Mawr, and St Brides, and one\nor two other places where they were customers of mine; but most of the\nrest were small farmers' sons, or shopkeepers' boys, and so on. These\nmay do very well for a parish, or even a congregation that never sees a\ngentleman (except when they are summoned--and not always then); however,\nthis sort will not do for a man who has served, ay, and been in battle,\nunder two baronets and an earl.\n\nTherefore I looked with some misgiving at these two great parsons; but\nit did not take mo long to perceive that each of them was of good birth\nat least, whatever his manners afterwards,--men who must feel themselves\nout of their rank when buttoned into a pulpit for reasoning with\nDevonshire plough-tail Bobs, if indeed they ever did so; and as for\ntheir flocks, they kept dogs enough at any rate to look after them. For\nthey both kept hounds; and both served their Churches in true hunting\nfashion--that is to say, with a steeplechase, taking true country at\nfull gallop over hedges and ditches, and stabling the horse in the\nvestry. All this I did not know as yet, or I must have thought even\nmore than I did concerning those two gentlemen. The taller of the two\nwas as fair and ruddy, and as free of countenance as a June rose in the\nsunshine; a man of commanding build and figure, but with no other\ncommand about him, and least of all, that of his own self. The other it\nwas that took my gaze, and held it, having caught mine eyes, until I\nforgot myself, and dropped them under some superior strength. For the\ntime, I knew not how I felt, or what it was that vanquished me; only\nthat my spirit owned this man's to be its master. Whether from excess of\ngoodness, or from depth of desperate evil, at the time I knew not.\n\nIt was the most wondrous unfathomable face that ever fellow-man fixed\ngaze upon; lost to mankindliness, lost to mercy, lost to all memory of\nGod. As handsome a face as need be seen, with a very strong forehead and\ncoal-black eyes, a straight white nose, and a sharp-cut mouth, and the\nchin like a marble sculpture. Disdain was the first thing it gave one to\nthink of; and after that, cold relentless humour; and after that,\nanything dark and bad.\n\nMeanwhile this was a very handsome man, as women reckon beauty; and his\nage not over forty, perhaps; also of good average stature, active and\nelegant form, and so on. Neither years nor cubits make much odds to a\nman of that sort; and the ladies pronounce him perfect.\n\nWhen these two were gone by, I was able to gaze again at the taller one.\nTruly a goodly man he was, though spared from being a good one. He\nseemed to stand over me, like Sir Philip; although I was measured for\nsix feet and one inch, before I got into rheumatic ways. And as for size\nand compass, my parents never could give me food to fetch out my girth,\nas this parson's was. He looked a good yard and a half round the chest,\nand his arms were like oak-saplings. However, he proved to be a man void\nof some pride and some evil desires, unless anybody bore hard on him;\nand as for reading the collects, or lessons, or even the burial service,\nI was told that no man in the British realm was fit to say \"Amen\" to\nhim. This had something to do with the size of his chest, and perhaps\nmight have helped to increase it. His sermons also were done in a style\nthat women would come many miles to enjoy; beginning very soft and\nsweet, so as to melt the milder ones; and then of a sudden roaring\ngreatly with all the contents of enormous lungs, so as to ring all round\nthe sides of the strongest weaker vessels. And as for the men, what\ncould they think, when the preacher could drub any six of them?\n\nThis was \"Parson Jack,\" if you please, his surname being \"Rambone,\" as I\nneed not say, unless I write for unborn generations. His business in\nBoutport Street that day was to see if any man would challenge him. He\nhad held the belt seven years, they said, for wrestling, as well as for\nbruising; the condition whereof was to walk the street both at\nBarnstaple fair and at Bodmin revels, and watch whether any man laid\nfoot across him.\n\nThis he did purely as a layman might. But the boxing and bruising were\npart of his office, so that he hung up his cassock always for a\nchallenge to make rent in it. There had been some talk of a Cornishman\ninterfering about the wrestling; and bad people hoped that he might so\nattempt, and never know the way home again; but as for the fighting, the\ncassock might hang till the beard of Parson Jack was grey, before any\none made a hole in it. Also the Cornish wrestler found, after looking at\nParson Jack, that the wisest plan before him was to challenge the other\nCornishmen, and leave the belt in Devonshire.\n\nAll this I found out at a little gathering which was held round the\ncorner, in Bear Street, to reflect upon the business done at the fair,\nand compare opinions. And although I had never beheld till then any of\nour good company, neither expected to see them again, there were no two\nopinions about my being the most agreeable man in the room. I showed\nthem how to make punch to begin with, as had been done by his Royal\nHighness, with me to declare proportions; and as many of the farmers had\nturned some money, they bade me think twice about no ingredient that\nwould figure on the bill, even half-a-crown.\n\nBy right of superior knowledge, and also as principal guest of the\nevening, I became voted the chairman, upon the clear understanding that\nI would do them the honour of paying nothing; and therein I found not a\nman that would think of evading his duty towards the chair. I entreated\nthem all to be frank, and regard me as if I were born in Barnstaple,\nwhich they might look upon as being done otherwise, as the mere turn of\na shaving; for my father had been there twice, and my mother more than\nonce thought of trying it. Everybody saw the force of this; and after a\nvery fine supper we grew as genial as could be. And leading them all\nwith a delicate knowledge of the ins and outs of these natives (many of\nwhich I had learned at the fair), and especially by encouraging their\nbent for contradiction, I heard a good deal of the leading people in the\ntown or out of it. I listened, of course, to a very great deal, which\nmight be of use to me or might not; but my object was, when I could\ngather in their many-elbowed stories, to be thoroughly up to the mark on\nthree points.\n\nFirst, about Fuzzy, and most important. Who was he? What was he? Where\ndid he live? Had he got a wife? And if so, why? And if not, more\nespecially, why again? Also, how much money had he, and what in the\nworld did he do with it; and could he have, under the rose, any reason\nfor keeping our women so distant? Particularly, I had orders to know\nwhether he was considered handsome by the Devonshire women. For our\nwomen could not make up their minds, and feared to give way to the high\nopinion engendered by his contempt of them. Only they liked his general\nhairiness, if it could be warranted not to come off.\n\nUpon this point I learned nothing at all. No man even knew Bethel Jose,\nor, at any rate, none would own to it, perhaps because Ikey was there to\nhearken; so I left that until I should get with the women. My next\nmatter was about Braunton Burrows, and the gentleman of high rank who\nwandered up and down without telling us why. And I might hereupon have\nwon some knowledge, and was beginning to do so, when a square stout man\ncame in and said \"Hush!\" and I would gladly have thrown a jug at him.\nNevertheless, I did learn something which I mean to tell next to\ndirectly.\n\nBut as concerned the third question before me (and to myself the most\nitching of any), satisfaction, to at least half-measure, was by proper\nskill and fortune brought within my reach almost. And this I must set\ndown at leisure, soberly thinking over it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nSOMETHING ABOUT HIM.\n\n\nIt was of course not Parson Rambone but the Parson Chowne who aroused my\ndesire of knowledge so strongly. And even here I was met at first by\nfailure and disappointment. The men would only shake their hands and\nsay \"Ah, he is a queer one!\" or, \"Well, well, we can't expect all folk\nto be alike, you know;\" or even some of the ruder spirits, \"You had\nbetter go yourself and ask him\"--a most absurd suggestion, for never yet\nhad I seen a man less fit to encourage impertinence. Far more ready\nwould I have been to displease even his great comrade, the Reverend John\nRambone; and no one who saw them together could doubt which of the two\nwas the master. My true course was clearly to bide my time, and, as\nchairman, to enhance the goodwill and geniality of the evening. And this\nI was ready enough to do--ay, and in the vein for it--bearing in mind\nthe wisdom of enjoying to the utmost such favourable circumstances, to\nbe on the free boot, and well received in a place entirely new to me,\nwhere I found myself so much ahead of everybody in matter of mind, and\nsome of them glad to acknowledge it; also where no customer could be\nwaiting to reproach me, nor even a justice of the peace well versed in\nmy countenance; moreover, blessed as I was with a sense of pity for\nthese natives, and a largeness of goodwill to them, such a chance had\nnever crossed me since the day my wife did.\n\nIkey and I had a good laugh also at that surly Bethel Jose, who had\nshown himself so much above the fair in mind, yet was there in body.\nNone but Bang, the boy, had been left for captain and crew of the Rose\nof Devon, and before it was dark we had found Bang shooting, at four\nshots a-penny, for cocoa-nut slices, with ginger-beer poured over them.\n\nNow fortune stood my friend that night, for before we began to find\nourselves in a condition at all uproarious, I managed to loosen the\ntongues of these natives by means of some excellent stories. Recalling\nthe fame of my grandfather (that long David Llewellyn, who made on his\nharp three unconquered ballads, and won the first prize at all the\nEisteddfods held during his life for Englynion), I could not accept it\nas my business to play second fiddle. Therefore, being in a happy mood,\nI was enabled to recount such stories as made these Devonshire folk open\ntheir mouths like a man at a great rock-oyster, while their experience\nwas in contention with faith and perhaps good manners. And as their\nnature is obstinate and most unwilling to be outdone, they found\nthemselves driven down at last to tell the most wonderful things they\nknew, or else to be almost nobodies. And putting aside what their\ngrandfathers might have seen or heard or even done--which is a mistake\nto dwell upon--all their stories worth curve of the ear were of Parson\nChowne, and no other.\n\nFor this man was a man, as we say. No other man must have a will that\nstood across the path of his. If he heard of any one unwilling to give\nway to him, he would not go to bed until he had taken that arrogance out\nof him. Many people, and even some of ten times his own fortune, had\ndone their best, one after the other, not to be beaten by him. All of\nthem found that they could not do it, and that their only chance of\ncomfort was to knock under to Parson Chowne. And even after that had\nbeen done, he was not always satisfied, but let them know from time to\ntime their folly in offending him. And most of all, he made a point (as\nwas natural perhaps) of keeping the Lord Bishop of the country under\nhim. Some of these had done their best (before they understood him) to\nmake his habits hold themselves within some stretch of discipline; or,\nif that could not be hoped, at any rate to keep silent. When he heard of\nthese ideas he was not a little pleased, because he descried a rare\nchance of sport, and he followed it up with their lordships. The law he\nknew to its lowest tittle, and while he broke it every day himself, woe\nto any man who dared to break it against him. And gradually these\nbishops came (one after the other growing a little alive to what the\nparsons were) not so much to let him alone as to desire his\nacquaintance--out of school, if so I may put it, in my ignorance of the\nbench of bishops. For well as I know a fish called \"the Pope,\" and also\na pear said to be \"Bishop's thumb,\" not to mention a grass called\n\"Timothy,\" it has not been my luck thus far to rise above the bench of\nmagistrates.\n\n\"Let be\" is the wisest thing one can say; and so everybody said of him,\nso soon as ever it was acknowledged that he could never be put down. And\nthus he might have done well enough if he would have been content with\nthis. Only it never was his nature to be content with anything, which is\nthe only true way to get on; if any one cares for that sort of thing,\nwho knows mankind's great randomness. Because the one who shoves and\nswears without being too particular, has the best chance to hoist\nhimself upon the backs of the humble. By dint of this, and to keep him\nquiet, Parson Chowne himself, they said, might have been bishop if so he\nhad chosen. For this he had some fine qualifications, for his very\nchoicest pleasure was found in tormenting his fellow-parsons: and a man\nof so bold a mind he was, that he believed in nothing except himself.\n\nEven his own servants never knew how to come nigh him. One at the\nstables would touch his hat, and he would kick him for reply; then\nanother would come without ceremony, and he knocked him down to learn\nit. Also in the house, the maidens had the same account to give. However\nmuch they might think of themselves, and adorn themselves to that\nestimate, he never was known to do so much as to chuck any one of them\nunder the chin, as they had been at all other places much in the habit\nof feeling; neither did he make a joke to excuse himself for omitting\nit. As to that, they would scorn themselves ever to think of permitting\nit, being young women of high respect, and quite aware how to conduct\nthemselves. But they might have liked to stop him, and they got no\nchance of doing it.\n\nAll this small-talk almost vexed me more than the content it gave. Every\nnow and then I could see the man in these little corner views, but they\ndid not show me round him so as to get his girth and substance. \"Think\nof the devil,\" is an old saying; and while I thought of him, in he\nwalked.\n\nAt the very first glimpse of him, all those people who had been talking\nso freely about him shrank away, and said, \"Servant, sir!\" and looked so\nfoolish more than usual, that he read them with one eye. He had his\nriding-clothes on now, and it made him look still sharper.\n\n\"Talking of me, good people, eh? I hope the subject pleases you. Open\nyour ranks, if you please, and show me whether my groom is behind you.\"\nHe cracked a great hunting-whip as he spoke, and it seemed a poor\nprospect for the groom, wherever he might be loitering.\n\n\"Plaize your honour, your honour's groom have not been here all day\na'most; and if her coom'th, us 'ont keep un.\"\n\n\"In that resolution you are wise. What! you here, Welshman? I marked you\nto-day. You will come to me by noon to-morrow. Here is for your\ncharges.\"\n\nHe threw on the table two crown-pieces, and was gone before I knew what\nanswer I was bound to make to him. The men, recovering from his\npresence, ran to the window to watch him as far as the flaring lights of\nthe fair, now spluttering low, displayed him. Without being able to see\nso much as I strongly desired to see of him, I could not help admiring\nnow his look, and his manner, and strong steady gait, and the general\nstyle of his outward man. His free way of going along made clear the\nexcellence of his clothing; and he swung his right elbow, as I was told,\nfrom his constant desire to lash a horse. He was the devil himself to\nride, so everybody said of him; and Parson Chowne's horse was now become\na by-word for any one thoroughly thrashed. And yet no other man must\never dare to touch his horses. If any one did, no deadlier outrage could\nbe put upon him.\n\nHearing these things from fourteen customers able to express their\nthoughts, I was sorry when the corner turned upon Parson Chowne, so\nwalking in the light of long deal tables, set with finely-guttering\ncandles, and with goods not quite sold out. And he left upon my memory a\nvision of a great commander, having a hat of controlling movements, and\na riding-coat so shaped that a horse appeared to be under it; and lower\ndown, buff leathern breeches, and boots well over the hinge of his legs,\nand silver heels, and silver spurs, and nothing to obscure him. No\ntopcoat or outer style of means to fend the weather, because he could\nkeep it in order always.\n\n\"I wish I was like him, then,\" said I; \"and what does he mean by\ninsulting me? I know a hundred bigger fellows. Am I at his beck and\ncall?\"\n\n\"I warr'n thou wilt be, zoon enough,\" answered, with a heavy grin, a\nlout of a fellow, who had shown no more sense than to leave the room at\nthe very crash and crown of one of my best stories; \"hast heered what\nPasson have now a dooed?\" He was come in primed with some rubbishing\ntale, and wanted the room to make much of him. Nevertheless, the men of\nperception had not done with me yet.\n\n\"Wuttever be un? wuttever be un? Spak up, Oasler Jan!\" cried some of the\naltogether younger men, who never know good work from bad, but seek some\nnew astonishment. Goodness knows how hard it was, and how wholly\nundeserved, for me to withdraw and let them talk, only because their\nnews was newer, and about a favourite man to talk of. However, I pressed\ndown my feelings, not being certain about my bill, if I offended any\none. For mercy's sake I spare their brogue, and tell their story\ndecently. And Ostler John's tale was as follows, so far as I could make\nit out, by means of good luck, and by watching his face.\n\nA certain justice of the peace, whose name was Captain Vellacott, a\ngentleman of spirit, who lived in one of the parishes belonging to this\nParson Chowne (who happened to have two churches), this gentleman had\ncontrived to give, as almost every one managed to do, deadly offence to\nParson Chowne. It was expected that the Parson would be content to have\nhim down and horsewhip him (as his manner was), and burn his house down\nafterwards. But the people who thought this were too hasty, and\nunderstood not his reverence. Whether from dislike of sitting upon the\nbench with him afterwards, or whether because Mrs Vellacott also had\ndared to shake hands with her gauntlet on, or because the baby cried\nwhen offered up to kiss the Parson--at any rate, Captain Vellacott must\nhave more than a simple chastisement. The Captain being a quick sharp\nman, who said a hot word and forgot it, laughed at every one who told\nhim to see to himself; and so on. \"The Parson,\" said he, \"is a man of\nhis cloth; so am I of mine; and I will not insult him by expecting\ninsult.\" So it came to pass that he made the mistake of measuring\nanother man by his own measure. After a few months this gentleman felt\nthat the Parson had quite forgiven him, no evil having befallen him yet,\nexcept that his rick-yard had twice been fired, and his wife insulted by\nthe naked people whom Chowne maintained upon Nympton Moor. And so, when\nthey met in the fair this day, the Captain bowed to the Parson, and\nmeant to go on and see to his business. But the other would not have it\nso. He offered his hand most cordially, and asked how Mrs Vellacott was,\nand all the five children, according to ages, using the Christian name\nof each. Captain Vellacott was so pleased by the kindness of his memory,\nand the nobility shown in dropping whatever had been between them, that\nwhat did he do but invite Master Chowne to dine with him up at the\nFortescue Arms Hotel, and see a young horse he had bought in the fair,\ngiving his own for it and five guineas; for he was not a rich man at\nall, and was come to make a moderate bargain.\n\nEverything might have gone on well, and perhaps the Parson really meant\nto forgive him at the moment for having dared, in the bygone matter, to\nhave a will of his own almost. But, as bad luck would have it, this very\nhorse that the Captain had bought turned out to be one which the Parson\nhad eye upon ever since last year's hunting season. However, not to\npaint the devil too black, it was confessed that he offered Vellacott\nfive pounds for his bargain. This ought to have satisfied any man who\nknew what Parson Chowne was, and that fifty times five pounds would be\nsaved by keeping out of his black books. Nevertheless the Captain stuck\nto his bargain and ruined himself.\n\nThe two gentlemen parted very good friends, shaking hands warmly, and\nhaving their joke, and hoping to dine again soon together; for Parson\nChowne could beat all the world at after-dinner stories; and the Captain\nwas the best man to laugh anywhere round the neighbourhood. And so he\nstarted rather early, on purpose to show his new horse to his wife.\n\nBut the ostler, who was a very old codger, and had seen a little of\nParson's ways, shook his head after the Captain's shilling, and spat\nupon it to prevent bad luck, and laid it on the shelf where he kept his\nblacking. He was too clever to say one word; but every one remembered\nhow he had behaved, and the sigh he gave--when he reminded them.\n\nIt may have been half an hour afterwards, or it may have been an hour\nand a half (so much these people differed), when Captain Vellacott on a\nhurdle came to Surgeon Cutcliffe's door, and the horse was led to\nFarrier Gould, who sent him to the mayor for opinions, and his worship\nsent him on to Pilch of the knacker's yard. Poor Justice Vellacott's\ncollar bone was snapped in two places, and his left thigh broken, also\nthree of his ribs stoven in, and a good deal of breakage abroad in his\nhead. However, they hoped that he might come round; and being a\nDevonshire man, he did, as I found out afterwards.\n\nThis tale, which Ostler John delivered at ten times the length of the\nabove, caused a very great stir and excitement and comparison of\nopinions. And when these wiseacres had almost exhausted their powers of\nwonder, I desired to know, in the name of goodness, why the poor Parson\nmust be saddled with every man who fell off his horse. In the first\nplace, he must have been far away from the scene of the misfortune,\ninasmuch as no more than an hour ago he was seeking his groom amongst\nus. And, again, what could be more likely than that Captain Vellacott\nmight have taken, with a view to good luck for his purchase, a bottle or\ntwo of wine beyond what otherwise would have contented him? And even if\nnot--why, a horse might fall, much more a man (who has only two legs),\nwithout anybody having designed it.\n\nThis reasoning of mine made no impression, because everybody's opinion\nwas set. \"Passon Chowne had adooed it;\" they scratched their heads and\nwent into side questions, but on the main point all agreed--\"'twor\nayther the Passon or the devil himzell.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nA VISIT TO A PARSON.\n\n\nMy opinion of Devonshire now grew fast that most of the people are mad\nthere. Honest, respectable, very kind-hearted, shrewd at a bargain, yet\ntrustful, simple, manly, and outspoken, nevertheless they must be mad to\nkeep Parson Chowne among them. But here, as in one or two other matters,\nI found myself wrong ere I finished with it. If a man visits a strange\ncountry, he ought to take time to think about it, and not judge the\nnatives by first appearance, however superior he may be. This I felt\neven then, and tried my very best to act up to it: nevertheless it came\nback on me always that in the large county of Devon there were only two\nsound people; Parson Chowne for the one--and, of course, for the other,\nDavy Llewellyn.\n\nSo I resolved to see this thing out, especially as (when I came to\nthink) nothing could be clearer than that the Parson himself had\ndescried and taken me (with his wonderful quickness) for the only\nintelligent man to be found. How he knew me to be a Welshman, I could\nnot tell then, and am not sure now. It must have been because I looked\nso superior to the rest of them. I gazed at the two crown-pieces, when I\ncame to be active again the next day; and finding them both very good, I\ndetermined to keep them, and go to see after some more. But if I thought\nto have got the right side of the bargain, so far as the money went, I\nreckoned amiss considerably; for I found that the Parson lived so far\naway, that I could not walk thither and back again without being\nfootsore for a week; and Captain Fuzzy would not allow it, especially as\nhe had bound me to help in discharging cargo. And being quite ignorant\nas to the road, to hire a horse would not avail me, even supposing I\ncould stay on board of him, which was against all experience. And by the\ntime I had hired a cart to take me to Nympton on the Moors, as well as a\nhand to pilot her, behold I was on the wrong side of my two crowns,\nwithout any allowance for rations. They told me that everybody always\ncharged double price for going up to the Parson's, and even so did not\ncare for the job much. Because, though it was possible to come back\nsafe, there was a poor chance of doing so without some damage to man or\nbeast, and perhaps to the vehicle also.\n\nHereupon I had a great mind not to go; but being assured upon all sides\nthat this would be a most dangerous thing, as well as supported,\nperhaps, by my native resolution and habits of inquiry, I nailed my\ncolours to the mast, and mounted the cart by the larboard slings. It was\na long and tiresome journey, quite up into a wilderness; and, for the\nlatter part of it, the track could not have been found, except by means\nof a rough stone flung down here and there. But the driver told me that\nParson Chowne took the whole of it three times a-week at a gallop, not\nbeing able to live without more harm than this lonely place afforded.\nFinding this fellow more ahead of his wits than most of those Devonshire\nyokels are, I beguiled the long journey by letting him talk, and now and\nthen putting a question to him. He was full, of course, like all the\ntown, of poor Captain Vellacott's misadventure, and the terrible spell\nput upon his new horse, which had seemed in the morning so quiet and\ndocile. This he pretended at first to explain as the result of a compact\nformed some years back between his reverence and the devil. For Parson\nChowne had thoroughly startled and robbed the latter of all self-esteem,\nuntil he had given in, and contracted to be at his beck and call (like a\ngood servant) until it should come to the settlement. And poor Parson\nJack was to be thrown in, though not such a very bad man sometimes; it\nbeing thoroughly understood, though not expressed between them, that\nParson Chowne was to lead him on, step by step, with his own pilgrimage.\n\nAll this I listened to very quietly, scarce knowing what to say about\nit. However, I asked the driver, as a man having intimate knowledge of\nhorses, whether he really did believe that they (like the swine of the\nGadarenes) were laid open to infection from even a man with seven devils\nin him; and the more so as these had been never cast out, according to\nall that appeared of him. At this he cracked his whip and thought, not\nbeing much at theology; and not having met, it may be, until now, a man\nso thoroughly versed in it. I gave him his time to consider it out; but\nthe trouble seemed only to grow on him, until he laid down his whip and\nsaid, not being able to do any more, \"Horses is horses, and pigs is\npigs, every bit the same as men be men. If the Lord made 'em both, the\ndevil had the right to take 'em both.\"\n\nThis was so sound in point of reasoning, as well as of what we do hear\nin church, that never another word could I say, being taken in my own\nshallowness. And this is the only thing that can happen to a fellow too\nfond of objections. However, the driver, perceiving now that he had been\ntoo much for me, was pleased with me, and became disposed to make it up\nby a freedom of further information. If I were to put this in his own\nwords, who could make head or tail of it? And indeed I could not stoop\nmy pen to write such outlandish language. He said that his cousin was\nthe very same knacker who had slaughtered that poor horse last night, to\nput it out of misery. Having an order from the mayor, \"Putt thiss here\nhannimall to deth,\" he did it, and thought no more about it, until he\ngot up in the morning. Then, as no boiling was yet on hand, he went to\nlook at this fine young horse, whose time had been so hastened. And the\nbrains being always so valuable for mixing with fresh--but I will not\ntell for the sake of honour--it was natural that he should look at the\nhead of this poor creature. Finding the eyes in a strange condition, he\nexamined them carefully, and, lifting the lids and probing round, in\neach he found a berry. My coachman said that his cousin now took these\ntwo berries which he had thus discovered out of a new horn-box, in which\nhe had placed them for certainty, and asked him to make out what they\nwere. The knacker, for his part, believed that they came from a creeping\nplant called the \"Bitter-sweet nightshade,\" or sometimes the \"Lady's\nnecklace.\" But his cousin, my coachman, thought otherwise. He had\nwandered a good deal about in the fields before he married his young\nwoman; and there he had seen, in autumnal days, the very same things as\nhad killed the poor horse. A red thing that sticks in a cloven pod, much\nharder than berries of nightshade, and likely to keep in its poison\nuntil the moisture and warmth should dissolve its skin. I knew what he\nmeant after thinking a while, because when a child I had gathered them.\nIt is the seed of a nasty flag, which some call the \"Roast-beef plant,\"\nand others the \"Stinking Iris.\" These poisonous things in the eyes of a\nhorse, cleverly pushed in under the lids, heating and melting, according\nas the heating and working of muscles crushed them; then shooting their\nred fire over the agonised tissues of eyeballs,--what horse would not\nhave gone mad with it?\n\nAlso finding so rare a chance of a Devonshire man who was not dumb, I\ntook opportunity of going into the matter of that fine old gentleman,\nwhose strange and unreasonable habit of seeking among those Braunton\nBurrows (as if for somebody buried there) had almost broken my rest ever\nsince, till I stumbled on yet greater wonders. Coachman, however, knew\nnothing about it, or else was not going to tell too much, and took a\nsudden turn of beginning to think that I asked too many questions,\nwithout even an inn to stand treat at. And perhaps he found out, with\nthe jerks of the cart, that I had a very small phial of rum, not enough\nfor two people to think of.\n\nHe may have been bidding for that, with his news; if so, he made a great\nmistake. Not that I ever grudge anything; only that there was not half\nenough for myself under the trying circumstances, and the man should\nhave shown better manners than ever to cast even half an eye on it.\n\nAt last we were forced, on the brow of a hill, to come to a mooring in a\nfine old ditch, not having even a wall, or a tree, or a rick of peat to\nshelter us. And half a mile away round the corner might be found (as the\ndriver said) the rectory house of Parson Chowne. Neither horse nor man\nwould budge so much as a yard more in that direction, and it took a\ngreat deal to make them promise to wait there till two of the clock for\nme. But I had sense enough to pay nothing until they should carry me\nhome again. Still I could not feel quite sure how far their courage\nwould hold out in a lonely place, and so unkind.\n\nAnd even with all that I feel within me of royal blood from royal\nbards--which must be the highest form of it--I did not feel myself so\nwholly comfortable and relishing as my duty is towards dinner-time.\nNevertheless I plucked up courage, and went round the corner. Here I\nfound a sort of a road with fir-trees on each side of it, all blown one\nway by strong storms, and unable to get back again. The road lay not in\na hollow exactly, but in a shallow trough of the hills, which these\nfir-trees were meant to fill up, if the wind would allow them occasion.\nAnd going between them I felt the want of the pole I had left behind me.\nAnd if I had happened to own a gold watch, or anything fit to breed\nenemies, the knowledge of my price would have kept me from such\ntemptation of Providence.\n\nA tremendous roaring of dogs broke upon me the moment I got the first\nglimpse of the house; and this obliged me to go on carefully, because of\nthat race I have had too much, and never found them mannersome. One huge\nfellow rushed up to me, and disturbed my mind to so great a degree that\nI was unable to take heed of anything about the place except his savage\neyes and highly alarming expression and manner. For he kept on showing\nhis horrible tusks, and growling a deep growl broken with snarls, and\nsidling to and fro, so as to get the better chance of a dash at me; and\nI durst not take my eyes from his, or his fangs would have been in my\nthroat at a spring. I called him every endearing name that I could lay\nmy tongue to, and lavished upon him such admiration as might have melted\nthe sternest heart; but he placed no faith in a word of it, and nothing\nexcept my determined gaze kept him at bay for a moment. Therefore I felt\nfor my sailor's knife, which luckily hung by a string from my belt; and\nif he had leaped at me he would have had it, as sure as my name is\nLlewellyn; and few men, I think, would find fault with me for doing my\nbest to defend myself. However, one man did, for a stern voice cried--\n\n\"Shut your knife, you scoundrel! Poor Sammy, did the villain threaten\nyou?\"\n\nSammy crouched, and fawned, and whimpered, and went on his belly to lick\nhis master, while I wiped the perspiration of my fright beneath my hat.\n\n\"This is a nice way to begin,\" said Chowne, after giving his dog a kick,\n\"to come here and draw a knife on my very best dog. Go down on your\nknees, sir, and beg Sammy's pardon.\"\n\n\"May it please your reverence,\" I replied, in spite of his eyes, which\nlay fiercer upon me than even those of the dog had done, \"I would have\ncut his throat; and I will, if he dares to touch me.\"\n\n\"That would grieve me, my good Welshman, because I should then let loose\nthe pack, and we might have to bury you. However, no more of this\ntrifle. Go in to my housekeeper, and recover your nerves a little, and\nin half an hour come to my study.\"\n\nI touched my hat and obeyed his order, following the track which he\npointed out, but keeping still ready for action if any more dogs should\nbear down on me. However, I met no creature worse than a very morose old\nwoman, who merely grunted in reply to the very best flourish I could\ncontrive, and led me into a long low kitchen. Dinner-time for the common\npeople being now at maturity, I expected to see all the servants of\ncourse, and to smell something decent and gratifying. However, there was\nno such luck, only, without even asking my taste, she gave me a small\njug of sour ale, and the bottom of a loaf, and a bit of Dutch cheese. Of\ncourse this was good enough for me; and having an appetite after the\nride, I felt truly grateful. However, I could not help feeling also that\nin the cupboard just over my elbow there lay a fillet of fine spiced\nbeef, to which I have always been partial. And after the perils I had\nencountered, the least she could do was to offer it down. Anywhere else\nI might have taken the liberty of suggesting this, but in that house I\ndurst not, further than to ask very delicately--\n\n\"Madam, it is early for great people; but has his reverence been pleased\nto dine?\"\n\n\"Did he give you leave to ask, sir?\"\n\n\"No, I cannot say that he did. I meant no offence; but only----\"\n\n\"I mean no offence; but only, you must be a stranger to think of asking\na question in this house without his leave.\"\n\nNothing could have been said to me more thoroughly grievous and\noppressive. And she offered no line or opening for me to begin again, as\ncross women generally do, by not being satisfied with their sting. So I\nmade the best of my bread-and-cheese, and thought that Sker House was a\nparadise compared to Nympton Rectory.\n\n\"It is time for you now to go to my master,\" she broke in with her cold\nharsh voice, before I had scraped all the rind of my cheese, and when I\nwas looking for more sour beer.\n\n\"Very well,\" I replied; \"there is no temptation of any sort, madam, to\nlinger here.\"\n\nShe smiled, for the first time, a very tart smile, even worse than the\nflavour of that shrewd ale, but without its weakness. And then she\npointed up some steps, and along a stone passage, and said, exactly as\nif she took me for no more than a common tramp--\n\n\"At the end of that passage turn to the left, and knock at the third\ndoor round the corner. You dare not lay hands on anything. My master\nwill know it if you do.\"\n\nThis was a little too much for me, after all the insults I had now put\nup with. I turned and gazed full on her strange square face, and into\nthe depth of her narrow black eyes, with a glimpse of the window showing\nthem.\n\n\"Your master!\" I said. \"Your son, you mean! And much there is to choose\nbetween you!\"\n\nShe did not betray any signs of surprise at this hap-hazard shot of\nmine, but coldly answered my gaze, and said--\n\n\"You are very insolent. Let me give you a warning. You seem to be a\npowerful man: in the hands of my master you would be a babe, although\nyou are so much larger. And were I to tell him what you have said, there\nwould not be a sound piece of skin on you. Now, let me hear no more of\nyou.\"\n\n\"With the greatest pleasure, madam. I am sure I can't understand\nwhatever could bring me here.\"\n\n\"But I can;\" she answered, more to her own thoughts than to mine, as she\nshut the door quite on my heels, and left me to my own devices. I felt\nalmost as much amiss as if I were in an evil dream of being chased\nthrough caves of rock by some of my very best customers, all bearing\nred-hot toasting forks, and pelting me with my own good fish. It is the\nvery worst dream I have, and it never comes after a common supper; which\nproves how clear my conscience is. And even now I might have escaped,\nbecause there were side passages; and for a minute I stood in doubt,\nuntil there came into my mind the tales of the pack of hounds he kept,\nand two or three people torn to pieces, and nobody daring to interfere.\nAlso, I wanted to see him again, for he beat everybody I had ever seen;\nand I longed to be able to describe him to a civilised audience at the\n\"Jolly Sailors.\" Therefore I knocked at the door of his room,\napproaching it very carefully, and thanking the Lord for His last great\nmercy in having put my knife into my head.\n\n\"You may come in,\" was the answer I got at last; and so in I went; and a\nqueerer room I never did go into. But wonderful as the room was surely,\nand leaving on memory a shade of half-seen wonders afterwards, for the\ntime I had no power to look at anything but the man.\n\nPeople may laugh (and they always do until they gain experience) at the\nidea of one man binding other men prisoners to his will. For all their\nlaughing, there stands the truth; and the men who resist such influence\nbest are those who do not laugh at it. I have seen too much of the\ntricks of the world to believe in anything supernatural; but the\ngranting of this power is most strictly within nature's scope; and\nsomebody must have it. One man has the gift of love, that everybody\nloves him; another has the gift of hate, that nobody comes near him; the\nthird, and far the rarest gift, combines the two others (one more, one\nless), and adds to them both the gift of fear. I felt, as I tried to\nmeet his gaze and found my eyes quiver away from it, that the further I\nkept from this man's sight, the better it would be for me.\n\nHe sat in a high-backed chair, and pointed to a three-legged stool, as\nmuch as to say, \"You may even sit down.\" This I did, and waited for him.\n\n\"Your name is David Llewellyn,\" he said, caring no more to look at me;\n\"you came from the coast of Glamorgan, three days ago, in the Rose of\nDevon schooner.\"\n\n\"Ketch, your reverence, if you please. The difference is in the\nmizzen-mast.\"\n\n\"Well, Jack Ketch, if you like, sir. No more interrupting me. Now you\nwill answer a few questions; and if you tell me one word of\nfalsehood----\"\n\nHe did not finish his sentence, but he frightened me far more than if he\nhad. I promised to do my best to tell the truth, so far as lies in me.\n\n\"Do you know what child that was that came ashore drowned upon your\ncoast, when the coroner made such a fool of himself?\"\n\n\"And the jury as well, your reverence. About the child I know nothing at\nall.\"\n\n\"Describe that child to the best of your power: for you are not\naltogether a fool.\"\n\nI told him what the poor babe was like, so far as I could remember it.\nBut something holy and harmless kept me from saying one word about\nBardie. And to the last day of my life I shall rejoice that I so\nbehaved. He saw that I was speaking truth; but he showed no signs of joy\nor sorrow, until I ventured to put in--\n\n\"May I ask why your reverence wishes to know, and what you think of this\nmatter, and how----\"\n\n\"Certainly you may ask, Llewellyn; it is a woman's and a Welshman's\nprivilege; but certainly you shall have no reply. What inquiry has been\nmade along your coast about this affair?\"\n\nI longed to answer him in my humour, even as he had answered me. With\nany one else I could have done it, but I durst not so with him.\nTherefore I told him all the truth, to the utmost of my\nknowledge,--making no secret of Hezekiah, and his low curiosity; also\nthe man of the press with the hat; and then I could not quite leave out\nthe visit of Anthony Stew and Sir Philip.\n\nThis more than anything else aroused Parson Chowne's attention. For the\npapers he cared not a damn, he said; for two of them lived by abusing\nhim; but as he swore not (except that once), it appeared to me that he\ndid care. However, he pressed me most close and hard about Anthony Stew\nand Sir Philip.\n\nWhen he had got from me all that I knew--except that he never once hit\nupon Bardie (the heart and the jewel of everything), he asked me without\nany warning--\n\n\"Do you know who that Sir Philip is?\"\n\n\"No, your reverence; I have not even heard so much as his surname,\nalthough, no doubt, I shall find out.\"\n\n\"You fool! Is that all the wit you have? Three days in and out of\nBarnstaple! It is Sir Philip Bampfylde of Narnton Court, close by you.\"\n\n\"There is no Narnton Court, that I know of, your reverence, anywhere\nround our neighbourhood. There is Candleston Court, and Court Isa, and\nCourt----\"\n\n\"Tush, I mean near where your ship is lying. And that is chiefly what I\nwant with you. I know men well; and I know that you are a man that will\ndo anything for money.\"\n\nMy breath was taken away at this: so far was it from my true character.\nI like money well enough in its way; but as for a single disgraceful\naction----\n\n\"Your reverence never made such a mistake. For coming up here I have\neven paid more than you were pleased to give me. If that is your point I\nwill go straight back. Do anything, indeed, for money!\"\n\n\"Pooh! This is excellent indignation. What man is there but will do so?\nI mean, of course, anything you consider to be right and virtuous.\"\n\n\"Anything which is undeniably right, and upright, and virtuous. Ah! now\nyour reverence understands me. Such has always been my character.\"\n\n\"In your own opinion. Well, self-respect is a real blessing: I will not\nask you to forego it. Your business will be of a nature congenial as\nwell as interesting to you. Your ship lies just in the right position\nfor the service I require; and as she is known to have come from Wales,\nno Revenue-men will trouble you. You will have to keep watch, both day\nand night, upon Sir Philip and Narnton Court.\"\n\n\"Nothing in the nature of spying, your reverence, or sneaking after\nservants, or underhand work----\"\n\n\"Nothing at all of that sort. You have nothing to do but to use your\neyes upon the river-front of the building, especially the landing-place.\nYou will come and tell me as soon as ever you see any kind of boat or\nvessel either come to or leave the landing-place. Also, if any man with\na trumpet hails either boat or vessel. In short, any kind of\ncommunication betwixt Narnton Court and the river. You need not take\nany trouble, except when the tide is up the river.\"\n\n\"Am I to do this against Sir Philip, who has been so kind and good to\nme? If so, I will hear no more of it.\"\n\n\"Not so; it is for Sir Philip's good. He is in danger, and very\nobstinate. He stupidly meddles with politics. My object is to save him.\"\n\n\"I see what your reverence means,\" I answered, being greatly relieved by\nthis; for then (and even to this day, I believe) many of the ancient\nfamilies were not content with his gracious Majesty, but hankered after\nungracious Stuarts, mainly because they could not get them. \"I will do\nmy best to oblige you, sir.\" I finished, and made a bow to him.\n\n\"To obey me, you mean. Of course you will. But remember one thing--you\nare not to dare to ask a single word about this family, or even mention\nSir Philip's name to anybody except myself. I have good reason for this\norder. If you break it I shall know it, and turn you to stone\nimmediately. You are aware that I possess that power.\"\n\n\"Please your reverence, I have heard so; and I would gladly see it\ndone--not to myself as yet, but rather to that old woman in the kitchen.\nIt could not make much difference to her.\"\n\n\"Keep your position, sir,\" he answered, in a tone which frightened me;\nit was not violent, but so deep. \"And now for your scale of wages. Of\ncourse, being opposite that old house, you would watch it without any\norders. The only trouble I give you is this--when the tide runs up after\ndark, and smooth water lets vessels over the bar, you will have to\nloosen your boat or dingy, punt, or whatever you call her, and pull\nacross the river, and lie in a shaded corner which you will find below\nNarnton Court, and commanding a view of it. Have you firearms? Then take\nthis. The stock is hollow, and contains six charges. You can shoot; I am\nsure of that. I know a poacher by his eyelids.\"\n\nHe gave me a heavy two-barrelled pistol, long enough for a gun almost,\nand meant to be fired from the shoulder. Then pressing a spring in the\nstock, he laid bare a chamber containing some ammunition, as well as a\ncouple of spare flints. He was going to teach me how to load it, till I\ntold him that I had been captain of cannon, and perhaps the best shot in\nthe royal navy.\n\n\"Then don't shoot yourself,\" he said, \"as most of the old sailors have\nreason to do. But now you will earn your living well, what with your\nwages on board the schooner and the crown a-week I shall give you.\"\n\n\"A crown a-week, your reverence!\" My countenance must have fallen sadly;\nfor I looked to a guinea a-week at least. \"And to have to stay out of my\nbed like that!\"\n\n\"It is a large sum, I know, Llewellyn. But you must do your best to earn\nit, by diligence and alacrity. I could have sent one of my fine naked\nfellows, and of course not have paid him anything. But the fools near\nthe towns are so fidgety now that they stare at these honest Adamites,\nand talk of them--which would defeat my purpose. Be off with you! I must\ngo and see them. Nothing else refreshes me after talking so long to a\nfellow like you. Here are two guineas for you--one in advance for your\nfirst month's wage; the other you will keep until I have done with you,\nand then return it to me.\"\n\n\"A month, your honour!\" I cried in dismay. \"I never could stop in this\ncountry a month. Why, a week of it would be enough to drive me out of my\nmind almost.\"\n\n\"You will stay as long as I please, Llewellyn. That second guinea, which\nyou pouched so promptly, is to enable you to come to me, by day or by\nnight, on the very moment you see anything worth reporting. You are\nafraid of the dogs? Yes, all rogues are. Here, take this whistle. They\nare trained to obey it--they will crouch and fawn to you when you blow\nit.\" He gave me a few more minute instructions, and then showed me out\nby a little side-door; and all the way back such a weight was upon me,\nand continual presence of strange black eyes, and dread of some hovering\ndanger, that I answered the driver to never a word, nor cared for any of\nhis wondrous stories about the naked people (whose huts we beheld in a\nvalley below us); nay, not even--though truly needing it, and to my own\ngreat amazement--could I manage a drop of my pittance of rum. So the\ndriver got it after all, or at least whatever remained of it, while I\nwished myself back at Old Newton Nottage, and seemed to be wrapped in an\nevil dream. Both horse and driver, however, found themselves not only\nthankful, but light-hearted, at getting away from Nympton Moor. Jack\neven sang a song when five miles off, and in his clumsy way rallied me.\nBut finding this useless, he said that it was no more than he had\nexpected; because it was known that it always befell every man who\nforgot his baptism, and got into dealings with Parson Chowne.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nON DUTY.\n\n\nThere are many people who cannot enter into my meaning altogether. This\nI have felt so often that now I may have given utterance to it once or\npossibly twice before. If so, you will find me consistent wholly, and\nquite prepared to abide by it. In all substantial things I am clearer\nthan the noon-day sun itself; and, to the very utmost farthing,\nrighteous and unimpeachable. Money I look at, now and then, when it\ncomes across me; and I like it well enough for the sake of the things it\ngoes for. But as for committing an action below the honour of my family\nand ancestors (who never tuned their harps for less than a mark\na-night), also, and best of all, my own conscience--a power that thumps\nall night like a ghost if I have not strictly humoured it,--for me to\ntalk of such things seems almost to degrade the whole of them.\n\nTherefore, if any one dreams, in his folly, that I would play the spy\nupon that great house over the river, I have no more to say, except that\nhe is not worthy to read my tale. I regard him with contempt, and loathe\nhim for his vile insinuations. Such a man is only fit to take the place\nof a spy himself, and earn perhaps something worth talking of, if his\ninterest let him talk of it. For taking friendly observation of Narnton\nCourt, for its inmates' sake, I was to have just five shillings a-week!\n\nIt became my duty now to attend to the getting out of the limestone; and\nI fetched it up with a swing that shook every leaf of the Rose of Devon.\nFuzzy attempted to govern me; but I let him know that I would not have\nit, and never knocked under to any man. And if Parson Chowne had come\nalongside, I would have said the same to him.\n\nNevertheless, as an honest man, I took good care to earn my money,\nthough less than the value of one good sewin, or at any rate of a fine\nturbot, each week. No craft of any sort went up or down that blessed\nriver without my laying perspective on her, if there chanced to be light\nenough; or if she slipped along after dark--which is not worth while to\ndo, on account of the shoals and windings--there was I, in our little\ndingy, not so far off as they might imagine. And I could answer for it,\neven with disdainful Chowne looking down through me, that nothing\nlarger than a row-boat could have made for Narnton Court. But I have not\nsaid much of the river as yet; and who can understand me?\n\nThis river bends in graceful courtesies to the sweet land it is leaving,\nand the hills that hold its birth. Also with a vein of terror at the\nunknown sea before it, back it comes, when you grieve to think that it\nmust have said \"good-bye\" for ever. Such a lovely winding river, with so\nmany wilful ways, silvery shallows, and deep, rich shadows, where the\ntrees come down to drink; also, beautiful bright-green meadows, sloping\nto have a taste of it, and the pleaches of bright sand offered to\nsatisfy the tide, and the dark points jutting out on purpose to protect\nit! Many rivers have I seen, nobler, grander, more determined, yet among\nthem all not one that took and led my heart so.\n\nHad I been born on its banks, or among the hills that gaze down over it,\nwhat a song I would have made to it!--although the Bardic inspiration\nseems to have dropped out of my generation, yet will it return with\nfourfold vigour, probably in Bunny's children, if she ever has any, that\nis to say, of the proper gender; for the thumb of a woman is weak on the\nharp. And Bunny's only aspiration is for ribbons and lollipops, which\nmust be beaten out of her.\n\nHowever, my principal business now was not to admire this river, but\nwatch it; and sometimes I found it uncommonly cold, and would gladly\nhave had quite an ugly river, if less attractive to white frosts. And\nwhat with the clearing of our cargo, and the grumbling afterwards, and\nthe waiting for sailing-orders and never getting any, and the setting-in\nof a sudden gale (which, but for me, must have capsized us when her hold\nwas empty), as well as some more delays which now I cannot stop to think\nof--the middle of October found us still made fast, by stem and stern,\nin Barnstaple river, at Deadman's Pill.\n\nParson Chowne (who never happened to neglect a single thing that did\nconcern his interests, any more than he ever happened to forget an\ninjury), twice or thrice a-week he came, mounted on his coal-black mare,\nto know what was going on with us. I saw--for I am pretty sharp, though\nnot pretending to vie with him, as no man might who had not dealt in a\nwholesale mode with the devil--I saw (though the clumsy under-strappers\nmeant me not to notice it) that Bethel Jose, our captain, was no more\nthan a slave of the Parson's. This made clear to me quite a lump of what\nhad seemed hopeless mysteries. Touching my poor self, to begin with,\nChowne knew all about me, of course, by means of this dirty Fuzzy. Also\nFuzzy's silence now, and the difficulty of working him (with any number\nof sheets in the wind), which had puzzled both Newton and Nottage, and\nthe two public-houses at Porthcawl, and might have enabled him to marry\neven a farmer's widow with a rabbit-warren, and \u00c2\u00a3350 to dispose of, and\na reputation for sheep's-milk cheese, and herself not bad-looking, in\nspite of a beard.\n\nI could see, and could carry home the truth, having thoroughly got to\nthe bottom of it; and might have a chance myself to settle, if I dealt\nmy secret well, with some of the women who had sworn to be single, until\nthat Fuzzy provoked them so. This consideration added, more than can be\nnow described, to my desire to get home before any one got in front of\nme. But Fuzzy, from day to day, pretended that the ketch was not\nvictualled to sail, any more than she was even ballasted. She must load\nwith hay, or with bricks, or pottery, or with something to fill her hold\nand pay freight, or what was to fill our bellies all the way back? And\nso on, and so on; until I was sure that he had some dark reason for\nlingering there.\n\nOf course I had not been such a pure fool--in spite of short seasons for\ngoing from home--as to forget my desire and need to come home, after\nproper interval. The whole of the parish would yearn for me, and so\nwould Ewenny and Llaleston, long ere the Christmas cod comes in; and I\nmade a point in my promises to be back before Gunpowder Treason and\nPlot. As a thoroughly ancient hand at the cannon, I always led the\nfireworks; and the Pope having done something violent lately, they were\nto be very grand this year. What is a man when outside his own\ncountry--a prophet, a magistrate, even a sailor, who has kept well in\nwith his relations? All his old friends are there, longing to praise\nhim, when they hear of good affairs; and as to his enemies--a man of my\nbreadth of nature has none.\n\nThis made it dreadfully grievous for me not to be getting home again;\nand my heart was like a sprouted onion when I thought of Bardie. Bunny\nwould fight on, I knew, and get converted to the Church in the house of\nour churchwarden, and perhaps be baptised after all, which my wife never\nwould have done to her. However, I did not care for that, because no\ngreat harm could come of it; and if the Primitives gave her ribbons, the\nChurch would be bound to grant Honiton lace.\n\nThinking of all my engagements, and compacts, and serious trusteeships,\nand the many yearnings after me, I told Bethel Jose, in so many words,\nthat I was not a black man, but a white man, unable to be trampled on,\nand prepared (unless they could show me better) to place my matter in\nthe hands of his worship, no less than the Mayor of Barnstaple. Fuzzy\ngrinned, and so did Ike; and finding the mayor sitting handsomely upon\nthe very next market-day, I laid my case before him. His worship (as\nkeeping a grocer's shop, at which I had bought three pounds of onions,\nand a quarter of a pound of speckled cheese, and half an ounce of\ntobacco) was much inclined to do me justice; and, indeed, began to do so\nin a loud and powerful voice, and eager for people to hearken him. But\nsomebody whispered something to him, containing, no doubt, the great\nParson's name, and he shrank back into his hole, and discharged my\nsummons, like a worm with lime laid on his tail.\n\nSuch things are painful; yet no man must insist upon them hardly,\nbecause our ancestors got on among far greater hardships. And it would\nprove us a bad low age if we turned sour about them. We are the finest\nfellows to fight that were ever according to Providence; we ought to be\nthankful for this great privilege (as I mean to show by-and-by), and I\nwould not shake hands with any man, who, for trumpery stuff, would dare\nto make such a terrible force internal.\n\nThis grand soundness of my nature led me to go under orders, though\nacquit of legal contract, only seeking to do the right while receiving\nthe money beforehand. Now this created a position of trust, for it\ninvolved a strong confidence in one's honour. Any man paying me\nbeforehand places me at a disadvantage, which is hardly fair of him. I\ndo not like to refuse him, because it would seem so ungraceful; and yet\nI can never be sure but that I ought to take consideration.\n\nNot to dwell too much upon scruples which scarcely any one else might\nfeel, and no other man can enter into, be it enough that my honour now\nwas bound to do what was expected. But what a hardship it was, to be\nsure, to find myself debarred entirely from forming acquaintance, or\nasking questions, or going into the matter in my own style! especially\nnow that my anxiety was quickened beyond bearing to get to the bottom of\nall these wonders about Sir Philip Bampfylde. What had led him to visit\nme? What was he seeking on Braunton Burrows--for now I knew that it must\nbe he? Why did Parson Chowne desire to keep such watch on the visitors\nto Narnton Court by water, while all the world might pass into or out of\nthe house by land? Or did the Parson keep other people watching the\nother side of the house, and prevent me from going near them, lest we\nshould league together to cheat him? This last thing seemed to be very\nlikely, and it proved to be more than that.\n\nRevolving all this much at leisure in the quiet churn of mind, I pushed\noff with my little dingy from the side of the Rose of Devon, when the\nevening dusk was falling, somewhere at October's end. This little boat\nnow seemed to be placed at my disposal always, although there used to be\nsuch a fuss, and turn for turn, in taking her. Now the glance of light\non water, and the flowing shadows, keeping humour with the quiet play of\nevening breezes, here a hill and there a tree or rock to be regarded,\nwhile the strong influx of sea with white wisps traced the middle\nchannel, and the little nooks withdrawn under gentle promontories took\nno heed of anything; when the moon came over these, dissipating clouds\nand moving sullen mists aside her track, I found it uncommonly difficult\nto be sure what I was up to. The full moon, lately risen, gazed directly\ndown the river; but memory of daylight still was coming from the\nwestward, feeble, and inclined to yield. What business was all this of\nmine? God makes all things to have turn; and I doubt if He ever meant\nmankind to be always spying into it. Ever so much better go these things\nwithout our bother; and our parson said, being a noble preacher, and fit\nany day for the navy, that the people who conquered the world, according\nto the prophet Joel--20th after Trinity--never noticed nature, never did\nconsult the Lord of Hosts, and yet must have contented Him.\n\nDifficult questions of this colour must be left to parsons (who beat all\nlawyers, out and out, in the matter of pure cleverness; because the\nlatter never can anyhow, but the former, somehow, with the greatest\nease, reconcile all difficulties). The only business I have to deal with\nis what I bodily see, feel, and hear, and have mind to go through with,\nand work out to perfect satisfaction. And this night I found more than\never broke upon my wits before, except when muzzle gapes at muzzle, and\nto blow or be blown up depends upon a single spark.\n\nBecause now, in my quiet manner (growing to be customary, under Parson\nChowne's regard) dipping oars, I crossed the river, making slant for\nrunning tide. That man, knowing everybody who might suit his purpose,\nhad employed me rather than old Ikey or even Fuzzy, partly because I\ncould row so well and make no sound in doing it; while either of them,\nwith muffled rowlocks, would splash and grunt, to be heard across river,\nand half-way to Barnstaple Bridge almost. As silently as an owl I\nskimmed across the silent river, not with the smallest desire to spy,\nbut because the poetry of my nature came out strongly. And having this\nupon me still, I rowed my boat into a drooping tree, overhanging a quiet\nnook. Here I commanded the river-front of all that great house, Narnton\nCourt, which stands on the north side of the water over against our\nDeadman's Pill. After several voyages under sundry states of light and\nweather, this was now approved to me as the very best point of\nobservation. For all the long and straggling house (quite big enough for\nany three of the magistrates' houses on our side) could have been taken\nand raked (as it were) like a great ship with her stern to me, from the\nspot where I lay hidden. Such a length it stretched along, with little\nexcept the west end to me, and a show of front-windows dark and void;\nand all along the river-terrace, and the narrow spread of it,\noverlooking the bright water, pagan gods, or wicked things just as bad,\nall standing. However, that was not my business; if the gentry will\nforego the whole of their Christianity, they must answer for themselves,\nwhen the proper time appears. Only we would let them know that we hold\naloof from any breach of their commandments.\n\nA flight of ten wild ducks had been seen coming up the river, every now\nand then, as well as fourteen red-caps, and three or four good wisps of\nteal. Having to see to my victualling now, as well as for the sport of\nit, I loaded the Parson's two-foot pistol, which was as good as a gun\nalmost, with three tobacco pipes full of powder poured into each barrel,\nand then a piece of an ancient hat (which Ikey had worn so long that no\nman could distinguish it from wadding), and upon the top of the hat\nthree ounces of leaden pellets, and all kept tight with a good dollop of\noakum. It must kill a wild duck at forty yards, or a red-cap up to\nfifty, if I hit the rogues in the head at all.\n\nThe tide must have been pretty nigh the flood, and the moon was rising\nhazily, and all the river was pale and lonely, for the brown-sailed\nlighters (which they call the \"Tawton fleet\") had long passed by, when I\nheard that silvery sound of swiftness cleaving solitude--the flight of a\nwedge of wild ducks. I knelt in the very smallest form that nature would\nallow of, and with one hand held a branch to keep the boat from surging.\nPlash they came down, after two short turns (as sudden as forked\nlightning), heads down for a moment, then heads up, and wings flapping,\nsousing, and subsiding. Quacks began, from the old drake first, and then\nfrom the rest of the company, and a racing after one another, and a\nrapid gambolling. Under and between them all, the river lost its\nsmoothness, beaten into ups and downs that sloped away in ridge and\nfurrow.\n\nThese fine fellows, as fat as butter after the barley-stubble time,\ncarried on such joy and glory within twenty yards of me that I could not\nbring my gun to bear for quiet shot, so as to settle four. Like an\nancient gunner, I bided my time, being up to the tricks of most of them.\nWhen their wild delight of water should begin to sate itself, what would\nthey do? Why, gather in round the father of the family, and bob their\nheads together. This is the time to be sure of them, especially with two\nbarrels fired at once, as I could easily manage. I never felt surer of\nbirds in my life; I smelt them in the dripping-pan, and beheld myself\nquite basting them, but all of a sudden, up they flew, when I had got\nthree in a line, and waited for two more to come into it, just as the\nmuzzle was true upon them--up and away, and left me nothing except to\nrub my eyes and swear. I might have shot as they rose, but something\ntold me not to do so. Therefore I crept back in my little punt, and\nwaited. In another moment I heard the swing of stout oars pulled with\ntime and power, such as I had not heard for years, nor since myself was\nstroke of it. Of course I knew that this must be a boat of the British\nnavy, probably the captain's gig, and choice young fellows rowing her;\nand the tears sprang into my eyes at thought of all the times and things\nbetween, and all the heavy falls of life, since thus I clove the waters.\nAll my heart went out towards her, and I held my breath with longing (as\nI looked between the branches of the dark and fluttering tree), just to\nlet them know that here was one who understood them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nTWO LOVERS.\n\n\nThe boat came round the corner swiftly of the wooded stretch of rock,\nwithin whose creek I lay concealed; and the officer in the stern-sheets\ncried, in the short sharp tone of custom, \"Easy, stroke; hold all!\" I\nheard him jerk the rudder-lines, as they passed within biscuit-toss of\nme, and with a heavy sheer he sent her, as if he knew every inch of\nwater, to the steps of Narnton Court: not the handsome balustrade, only\na landing of narrow stone-way nearer to me than the western end, and\nwhere the river-side terrace stopped. Two men sprang ashore and made the\nboat fast at the landing, and then some others lifted out what seemed to\nbe a heavy chest, and placed it on the topmost step, until the officer,\nhaving landed, signed to them to bear it further to a corner of the\nparapet. I could see the whole of these doings, and distinguish him by\nhis uniform, because the boat and the group of sailors were not more\nthan fifty yards from me, and almost in the track of the moon from the\nplace where I was hiding. In a minute or two all returned to the boat,\nwith the exception of the officer, and I heard him give orders from the\nshore--\n\n\"Round the point, men! Keep close, and wait for me under the Yellow Hook\nI showed you.\"\n\nThe coxswain jumped into the stern-sheets; in a second or two they had\nput about, and the light gig pulling six good oars shot by me, on the\nfirst of the ebb, as swiftly almost as the wild ducks flew. Meanwhile\nthe officer stood and gazed until they had rounded the western point,\nfrom which they had spoiled my shot so; and knowing the vigilant\nkeenness of a British captain's eyes, I feared that he might espy my\npunt, which would have disgraced me dreadfully. And even without this I\nfelt how much I would rather be far away. There could have been no man\nmore against my taste to keep a watch upon than a captain in the royal\nnavy, whose father might have been over me. And vigorously as I called\nto mind that all I was doing must be for his good, as well as for that\nof his relatives, I could not find that satisfaction which ought to flow\nfrom such benevolence. However, it now was too late to back out, even if\nmy desire to know the end of this matter allowed of it.\n\nThe officer stood for a minute or two, as if in brown thoughts and deep\nmelancholy, and turned to the house once or twice, and seemed to\nhesitate as to approaching it. The long great house, with the broad\nriver-front, looked all dark and desolate; not a servant, a horse, or\neven a dog was moving, and the only sign of life I could see was a dull\nlight in a little window over a narrow doorway. While I was wondering at\nall this, and the captain standing gloomily, a little dark figure\ncrossed the moonlight from the shadowy doorway, and the officer made a\nstep or two, and held out his arms and received it. They seemed to stay\npretty well satisfied thus, the figure being wholly female, until, with\na sudden change of thought, there seemed to be some sobbing. This led\nthe captain to try again some soft modes of persuasion, such as I could\nnot see into, even if I would have deigned to do a thing against my\ngrain so, because I have been in that way myself, and did not want to be\nlooked at. However, not to be too long over what every man almost goes\nthrough (some honestly, and some anyhow, but all tending to experience),\nmy only desire was, finding them at it, to get out of the way very\nquickly. For, poor as I am, there were several women of Newton, and\nLlaleston, and Ewenny, and even of Bridgend, our market-town, setting\ntheir caps, like springles, at me! Whereas I laboured at nothing else\nbut to pay respect to my poor wife's memory, and never have a poor woman\nafter her. And now all these romantic doings made me feel uneasy, and\nready to be infected, so as to settle with nothing more than had been\noffered me thrice, and three times refused--a 7-foot-and-6-inch mangle;\nand (if she proved a tiger) have to work it myself perhaps!\n\nBe that either way, these two unhappy lovers came along, while I was\nwondering at them, yet able to make allowance so, until they must have\nseen me, if they had a corner of an eye for anything less than one\nanother. They stood on a plank that crossed the narrow creek or slot\n(wherein I lay, under a willow full of brown leaves), and scarcely ten\nyards from me. Here there was a rail across, about as big as a\nkidney-bean stick, whereupon they leaned, and looked into the water\nunder them. Then they sighed, and made such sorrow (streaked somehow\nwith happiness) that I got myself ready to leap overboard if either or\nboth of them should jump in. However, they had more sense than that;\nthough they went on very tenderly, and with a soft strain quite unfit to\nbelong to a British officer. Being, from ancient though humble birth,\ngifted with a deal of delicacy, I pulled out two plugs of tobacco, which\nhappened to be in my mouth just now, and I spared them both to stop my\nears, though striking inwards painfully. I tried to hear nothing for\never so long; but I found myself forced to ease out the plugs, they did\nsmart so confoundedly. And this pair wanted some one now to take a\njudicious view of them, for which few men, perhaps, could be found\nbetter qualified than I was. For they carried on in so high a manner,\nthat it seemed as if they could be cured by nothing short of married\nlife, of which I had so much experience. And the principal principle of\nthat state is, that neither party must begin to make too much of the\nother side. But being now over that sort of thing, I found myself snug\nin a corner, and able to view them with interest and considerable\ncandour.\n\n\"Is there no hope of it, then, after all; after all you have done and\nsuffered, and the prayers of everybody?\" This was the maiden, of course\nhaving right to the first word, and the last of it.\n\n\"There is hope enough, my darling; but nothing ever comes of it. And how\ncan I search out this strange matter, while I am on service always?\"\n\n\"Throw it up, Drake; my dear heart, for my sake, throw it up, and throw\nover all ambition, until you are cleared of this foul shame.\"\n\n\"My ambition is slender now,\" he answered, \"and would be content with\none slender lady.\" Here he gave her a squeeze, that threatened not only\nto make her slenderer, but also to make the rail need more stoutness,\nand me to keep ready for plunging. \"Nevertheless, you know,\" he went on,\nwhen the plank and the rail put up with it, \"I cannot think of myself\nfor a moment, while I am thus on duty. We expect orders for America.\"\n\n\"So you said; and it frightens me. If that should be so, what ever, ever\ncan become of us?\"\n\n\"My own dear, you are a child; almost a child for a man like me, knocked\nabout the world so much, and ever so unfortunate.\"\n\nThe rest of his speech was broken into, much to my dissatisfaction, by a\nsoft caressing comfort, such as women's pity yields without any\nconsideration. Only they made all sorts of foolish promises, and eternal\npledges, touched up with confidence, and hope, and mutual praise, and\nfaith, and doubt, and the other ins and outs of love.\n\n\"I won't cry any more,\" she said, with several sobs between it; \"I ought\nnot to be so with you, who are so strong, and good, and kind. Your\nhonour is cruelly wronged at home: you never shall say that your own,\nown love wished you to peril it also abroad.\"\n\nHe took her quietly into his arms; and they seemed to strengthen one\nanother. And to my eyes came old tears, or at any rate such as had come\nlong ago. These two people stood a great time, silent, full of one\nanother, keeping close with reverent longing, gazing yet not looking at\nthe moonlight and the water. Then the delicate young maiden (for such\nher voice and outline showed her, though I could not judge her face)\nshivered in the curling fog which the climbing moon had brought.\nHereupon the captain felt that her lungs must be attended to, as well as\nher lips, and her waist, and heart; and he said in a soft way, like a\nshawl--\n\n\"Come away, my lovely darling, from the cold, and fog, and mist. Your\nlittle cloak is damp all through; and time it is for me to go.\nDiscipline I will have always; and I must have the same with you, until\nyou take command of me.\"\n\n\"Many, many a weary year, ere I have the chance of it, Captain Drake.\"\nThe young thing sighed as she spoke, though perhaps without any sense of\nprophecy.\n\n\"Isabel, let us not talk like that, even if we think it. The luck must\nturn some day, my darling; even I cannot be always on the evil side of\nit. How often has my father said so! And what stronger proof can I have\nthan you? As long as you are true to me----\"\n\nThey were turning away, when this bright idea, which seems to occur to\nlovers always, under some great law of nature, to prolong their\ninterviews;--this compelled them to repeat pretty much the same forms,\nand ceremonies, assurances, pledges, and suchlike, which had passed\nbetween them scarcely more than three or four minutes ago, at the\nutmost. And again I looked away, because I would have had others do so\nto me; and there was nothing new to learn by it.\n\n\"Only one thing more, my own,\" said the lady, taking his arm again; \"one\nmore thing you must promise me. If you care for me at all, keep out of\nthe way of that dreadful man.\"\n\n\"Why, how can I meet him at sea, my Bell? Even if he dislikes me, as you\ntell me perpetually, though I never gave him cause, that I know of.\"\n\n\"He does not dislike you, Drake Bampfylde; he hates you with all the\nvenomous, cold, black hatred, such as I fear to think of--oh my dear, oh\nmy dear!\"\n\n\"Now, Isabel, try not to be so foolish. I never could believe such a\nthing, and I never will, without clearest proof. I never could feel like\nthat myself, even if any one wronged me deeply. And in spite of all my\nbad luck, Bell, I have never wronged any one. At least more than you\nknow of.\"\n\n\"Then don't wrong me, my own dear love, by taking no heed of yourself.\nHere, there, and everywhere seems to be his nature. You may be proud of\nyour ship and people, and of course they are proud of you. You may be\nordered to Gibraltar, where they have done so gloriously, or to America,\nor to India. But wherever you are, you never can be out of the reach of\nthat terrible man. His ways are so crooked, and so dark, and so\ndreadfully cold-blooded.\"\n\n\"Isabel, Isabel, now be quiet. What an imagination you have! A man in\nholy orders, a man of a good old family, who have been ancient friends\nof ours----\"\n\n\"A bad old family, you mean--bad for generations. It does not matter, of\ncourse, what I say, because I am so young and stupid. But you are so\nfrank, and good, and simple, and so very brave and careless, and I know\nthat you will own some day--oh, it frightens mo so to think of it!--that\nyou were wrong in this matter, and your Isabel was right.\"\n\nWhat his answer was I cannot tell, because they passed beyond my hearing\nupon their way towards the house. The young lady, with her long hair\nshining like woven gold in the moonlight, tried (so far as I could see)\nto persuade him to come in with her. This, however, he would not do,\nthough grieving to refuse her; and she seemed to know the reason of it,\nand to cease to urge him. In and out of many things, which they seemed\nto have to talk of, he showed her the great chest in the dark corner;\nand perhaps she paid good heed to it. As to that, how can I tell, when\nthey both were so far off, and river-fogs arising? Yet one thing I well\ncould tell, or at any rate could have told it in the times when my blood\nran fast, and my habit of life was romantic. Even though the light was\nfoggy, and there was no time to waste, these two people seemed so to\nstay with a great dislike of severing.\n\nHowever, they managed it at last; and growing so cold in my shoulders\nnow, as well as my knees uncomfortable, right glad was I to hear what\nthe maiden listened to with intense despair; that is to say, the\ncaptain's footfall, a yard further off every time of the sound. Ho went\nalong the Braunton road, to find his boat where the river bends. And\nmuch as I longed to know him better, and understand why he did such\nthings, and what he meant by hankering so after this young lady, outside\nhis own father's house, and refusing to go inside when invited, and\nspeaking of his own bad luck so much, and having a chest put away from\nthe moonlight, likewise his men in the distance so far, and compelled to\nkeep round the corner, not to mention his manner of walking, and\nswinging his shoulders, almost as if the world was nothing to him;\nalthough I had never been perhaps so thoroughly pushed with desire of\nknowledge, and all my best feelings uppermost, there was nothing for me\nleft except to ponder, and to chow my quid, rowing softly through the\nlanes and lines of misty moonlight, to my little cuddy-home across the\ntidal river.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nAMONG THE SAVAGES.\n\n\nAt this moment it became a very nice point to perceive what was really\nhonest and right, and then to carry it out with all that fearless\nalacrity, which in such cases I find to be, as it were, constitutional\nto me. My high sense of honour would fain persuade me to keep in\nstrictest secrecy that which (so far as I could judge) was not, or might\nnot have been, intended for my eyes, or ears, or tongue. On the other\nhand, my still higher sense of duty to my employer (which is a most\nneedful and practical feeling), and that power of loyalty which descends\nto me, and perhaps will die with me, as well as a strong, and no less\nancestral, eagerness to be up to the tricks of all mysterious beings--I\ndo not exaggerate when I say that the cut-water of my poor mind knew not\nwhich of these two hands pulled the stronger oar.\n\nIn short, being tired, and sleepy, and weary, and worn out with want of\nperceiving my way, although I smoked three pipes all alone (not from the\nsmallest desire for them, but because I have routed the devil thus many\nand many a night I know--as the priests do with their incense; the\nreason of which I take to be, that having so much smoke at home, he\nshuns it when coming for change of air--growing dreamy thus), I said,\nwith nobody to answer me, \"I will tumble into my berth, as this dirty\ncraft has no room for hammocks; and, between Parson and Captain, I will\nleave my dreams to guide me.\"\n\nI played with myself, in saying this. No man ever should play with\nhimself. It shows that he thinks too troublesomely; and soon may come,\nif he carries it on, almost to forget that other people are nothing,\nwhile himself is everything. And if any man comes to that state of mind,\nthere is nothing more to hope of him.\n\nI was not so far gone as that. Nevertheless, it served me right (for\nthinking such dreadful looseness) to have no broad fine road of sleep,\nin the depth whereof to be borne along, and lie wherever wanted; but\ninstead of that to toss and kick, with much self-damage, and worst of\nall, to dream such murder that I now remember it. What it was, belongs\nto me, who paid for it with a loss of hair, very serious at my time of\nlife. However, not to dwell upon that, or upon myself in any way--such\nbeing my perpetual wish, yet thwarted by great activity--let it be\nenough to say that Parson Chowne in my visions came and horribly stood\nover me.\n\nTherefore, arising betimes, I hired a very fine horse, and, manning him\nbravely, laid his head east and by south, as near as might be, according\nto our binnacle. But though the wind was abaft the beam, and tide and\nall in his favour, and a brave commander upon his poop, what did he do\nbut bouse his stem, and run out his spanker-driver, and up with his\ntaffrail, as if I was wearing him in a thundering heavy sea. I resolved\nto get the upper hand of this uncalled-for mutiny; and the more so\nbecause all our crew were gazing, and at the fair I had laid down the\nlaw very strictly concerning horses. I slipped my feet out of the\nchains, for fear of any sudden capsize, and then I rapped him over the\ncatheads, where his anchor ought to hang. He, however, instead of doing\nat all what I expected, up with his bolt-sprit and down with his\nquarter, as if struck by a whale under his forefoot. This was so far\nfrom true seamanship, and proved him to be so unbuilt for sailing, that\nI was content to disembark over his stern, and with slight concussions.\n\n\"Never say die\" has always been my motto, and always will be: nailing my\ncolours to the mast, I embarked upon another horse of less than half the\ntonnage of that one who would not answer helm. And this craft, being\nbroken-backed, with a strange sound at her port-holes, could not under\npress of sail bowl along more than four knots an hour. And we adjusted\nmatters between us so, that when she was tired I also was sore, and\ntherefore disembarked and towed her, until we were both lit for sea\nagain. Therefore it must have been good meridian when I met Parson\nChowne near his house.\n\nThis man was seldom inside his own house, except at his meal-times, or\nwhen asleep, but roving about uncomfortably, seeing to the veriest\ntrifles, everywhere abusing or kicking everybody. And but for the\ncertainty of his witchcraft (ninefold powerful, as they told me, when\nconferred upon a parson), and the black strength of his eyes, and the\ndoom that had befallen all who dared to go against him, the men about\nthe yards and stables told me--when he was miles away--that they never\ncould have put up with him; for his wages were also below their deserts.\n\nHe came to me from the kennel of hounds, which he kept not for his own\npleasure so much as for the delight of forbidding gentlemen, whenever\nthe whim might take him so, especially if they were nobly accoutred,\nfrom earning at his expense the glory of jumping hedges and ditches.\nNow, as he came towards me, or rather beckoned for me to come to him, I\nsaw that the other truly eminent parson, the Reverend John Rambone, was\nwith him, and giving advice about the string at the back of a young\ndog's tongue. Although this man was his greatest friend, Master Chowne\ntreated him no better than anybody else would fare; but signed to the\nmate of the hounds, or whatever those fox-hunters call their chief\nofficer, to heed every word of what Rambone said. Because these two\ndivines had won faith, throughout all parishes and hundreds: Chowne for\nthe doctrine of horses; and for discipline of dogs, John Rambone.\n\nHis Reverence fixed a stern gaze upon me, because I had not hurried\nmyself--a thing which I never do except in a glorious naval action--and\nthen he bade me follow him. This I did; and I declare even now I cannot\ntell whither he took me. For I seemed to have no power, in his presence,\nof heeding anything but himself: only I know that we passed through\ntrees, and sate down somewhere afterwards. Wherever it was, or may have\nbeen, so far as my memory serves, I think that I held him at bay some\nlittle. For instance, I took the greatest care not to speak of the fair\nyoung lady; inasmuch as she might not have done all she did, if she had\nchanced to possess the knowledge of my being under the willow-tree. But\nParson Chowne, without my telling, knew the whole of what was done; and\nwhat he thought of it none might guess in the shadowy shining of his\neyes.\n\n\"You have done pretty well on the whole,\" he said, after asking many\nshort questions; \"but you must do better next time, my man. You must not\nallow all these delicate feelings, chivalry, resolute honesty, and\nlittle things of that sort, to interfere thus with business. These\nthings do some credit to you, Llewellyn, and please you, and add to your\nhappiness, which consists largely with you (as it does with all men) in\nconceit. But you must not allow yourself thus to coquet with these\nbeauties of human nature. It needs a rich man to do that. Even add my\nfive shillings to your own four, and you cannot thus go to Corinth.\"\n\nI had been at Corinth twice, and found it not at all desirable; so I\ncould not make out what his Reverence meant, except that it must be\nsomething bad; which at my time of life should not be put into the mind\neven by a clergyman. But what I could least put up with was, the want of\nencouragement I found for all my better feelings. These seemed to meet\nwith nothing more than discouragement and disparagement, whereas I knew\nthem to be sound, substantial, and solid; and I always felt upon going\nto bed what happiness they afforded me. And if the days of my youth had\nonly passed through learned languages, Latin and Greek and Hebrew, I\ndoubt whether even Parson Chowne could have laid his own will upon me\nso.\n\n\"Supposing, then, that your Reverence should make it ten,\" I answered;\n\"with my own four, that would be fourteen.\"\n\n\"I can truly believe that it would, my man. And you may come to that, if\nyou go on well. Now go into the house and enjoy yourself. You Welshmen\nare always hungry. And you may talk as freely as you like; which is your\nnext desire. Every word you say will come back to me; and some of it may\namuse me. If you have no sense you have some cunning. You will know what\nthings to speak of. And be sure that you wait until I come back.\"\n\nThis was so wholly below and outside of the thing which I love to\nreconcile with my own constitution (having so long been respected for\nthem, as well as rewarded by conscience), that I scarcely knew where or\nwho I was, or what might next come over me. And to complete my\nuncomfortable sense of being nobody, I heard the sound of a galloping\nhorse downhill as wild as could be, and found myself left as if all the\nideas which I was prepared to suggest were nothing. However, that was\nnot my loss, but his; so I entered the house, with considerable hope of\nenjoying myself, as commanded. For this purpose I have always found it,\nin the house of a gentleman, the height of luck to get among three young\nwomen and one old one. The elderly woman attends to the cooking, which\nis not understood by the young ones, or at any rate cannot be much\nexpected; while, on the other hand, the young ones flirt in and out in a\npleasant way, laying the table and showing their arms (which are of a\nlovely red, as good as any gravy); and then if you know how to manage\nthem well, with a wholesome deference to the old cook, and yet an\nunderstanding--while she is basting, and as one might almost say, behind\nher back--a confidential feeling established that you know how she\ntreats those young ones, and how harshly she dares to speak, if a coal\ncomes into the dripping-pan, and in casting it out she burns her face,\nand abuses the whole of them for her own fault; also a little shy\nsuggestion that they must put up with all this, because the old cook is\npast sweethearting time, and the parlour-maid scarcely come to it,\naccompanied by a wink or two, and a hint in the direction of the\nstables--some of the very noblest dinners that ever I made have been\nthus introduced. But what forgiveness could I expect, or who would\nlisten to me, if I dared to speak in the same dinner-hour of the goodly\nkitchen at Candleston Court, or even at Court Ysha, and the place that\nserved as a sort of kitchen, so far as they seemed to want one, at this\nNympton Rectory? A chill came over every man, directly he went into it;\nand he knew that his meat would be hocks and bones, and his gravy (if\nany) would stand cold dead. However, I made the best of it, as my manner\nis with everything; and though the old stony woman sate, and seemed to\nmake stone of every one, I kept my spirits up, and became (in spite of\nall her stoppage) what a man of my knowledge of mankind must be among\nwomankind. In a word, though I do not wish to set down exactly how I\nmanaged it, in half an hour I could see, while carefully concealing it,\nthat there was not a single young woman there without beginning to say\nto herself, \"Should I like to be Mrs Llewellyn?\" After that, I can have\nthem always. But I know them too well, to be hasty. No prospects would\nsuit me, at my time of life, unless they came after some cash in hand.\nThe louts from the stables and kennels poured in, some of them very\n\"degustin\" (as my Bardie used to say), nevertheless the girls seemed to\nlike them; and who was I, even when consulted, to pretend to say\notherwise? In virtue of what I had seen, among barbarous tribes and\neverywhere, and all my knowledge of ceremonies, and the way they marry\none another, it took me scarcely half an hour (especially among poor\nvictuals) to have all the women watching for every word I was prepared\nto drop. Although this never fails to happen, yet it always pleases me;\nand to find it in Parson Chowne's kitchen go thus, and the stony woman\nherself compelled to be bitten by mustard for fear of smiling, and two\nor three maids quite unfit to get on without warm pats on their\nshoulder-blades, and the dogs quite aware that men were laughing, and\nthat this meant luck for them if they put up their noses; it was not for\nme to think much of myself; and yet how could I help doing it?\n\nIn the midst of this truly social joy, and natural commune over\nvictuals, and easing of thought to suit one another in the courtesies of\ndigestion; and just as the slowest amongst us began to enter into some\nknowledge of me, in walked that great Parson Rambone, with his hands\nbehind his back, and between them a stout hunting-crop. The maidens\nseemed to be taken aback, but the men were not much afraid of him.\n\n\"What a rare royster you are making! Out by the kennel I heard you.\nHowever can I write my sermons?\"\n\n\"Does your Reverence write them in the kennel?\" Thus the chief huntsman\nmade inquiry, having a certain privilege.\n\n\"Clear out, clear out,\" said Rambone, fetching his whip toward all of\nus; \"I am left in authority here, and I must have proper discipline. Mrs\nSteelyard, I am surprised at you. Girls, you must never go on like this.\nWhat will his Reverence say to me? Come along with me, thou villain\nWelshman, and give me a light for my pipe, if you please.\"\n\nIt was a sad thing to behold a man of this noble nature, having gifts of\neverything (whether of body, or heart, or soul), only wanting gift of\nmind; and for want of that alone, making wreck of all the rest. I let\nhim lead me; while I felt how I longed to have the lead of him. But that\nwas in stronger hands than mine.\n\n\"Come, and I'll show thee a strange sight, Taffy,\" he said to me very\npleasantly, as soon as his pipe was kindled; \"only I must have my horse,\nto inspire them with respect for me, as well as to keep my distance.\nWhere is thy charger, thou valiant Taffy?\"\n\nI answered his Reverence that I would rather travel afoot, if it were\nnot too far; neither could he persuade me, after the experience of that\nmorning, to hoist my flag on an unknown horse, the command of which he\noffered me. So forth we set, the Parson on horseback, and in very high\nspirits, trolling songs, leaping hedges, frolicking enough to frighten\none, and I on foot, rather stiff and weary, and needing a glass of grog,\nwithout any visible chance of getting it.\n\n\"Here, you despondent Taffy; take this, and brighten up a bit. It is\ntrue you are going to the gallows; but there's no room for you there\njust now.\"\n\nI saw what he meant, as he handed me his silver hunting-flask, for they\nhave a fashion about there of hanging bad people at cross ways, and\nleaving them there for the good of others, and to encourage honesty. And\ntruly the place was chosen well; for in the hollow not far below it,\nmight be found those savage folk, of whom I said something a good while\nago. And I did not say then what I might have said; because I felt\nscandalised, and unwilling to press any question of doubtful doings upon\nthoroughly accomplished people. But now I am bound, like a hospital\nsurgeon, to display the whole of it.\n\n\"Take hold of the tail of my horse, old Taffy,\" said his Reverence to\nme; \"and I will see you clear of them. Have no fear, for they all know\nme.\"\n\nBy this time we were surrounded with fifteen or twenty strange-looking\ncreatures, enough to frighten anybody. Many fine savages have I seen--on\nthe shores of the Land of Fire, for instance, or on the coast of Guinea,\nor of the Gulf of Panama, and in fifty other places--yet none did I ever\ncome across so outrageous as these were. They danced, and capered, and\ncaught up stones, and made pretence to throw at us; and then, with\nhorrible grimaces, showed their teeth and jeered at us. Scarcely any of\nthe men had more than a piece of old sack upon him; and as for the\nwomen, the less I say, the more you will believe it. My respect for\nrespectable women is such that I scarcely dare to irritate them, by not\nsaying what these other women were as concerns appearance. And yet I\nwill confine myself, as if of the female gender, to a gentle hint that\nthese women might have looked much nicer, if only they had clothes on.\n\nBut the poor little \"piccaninies,\" as the niggers call them these poor\nlittle devils were far worse off than any hatch of negroes, or Maroons,\nor copper-colours anywhere in the breeding-grounds. Not so much from any\nwant of tendance or clean management, which none of the others ever got;\nbut from difference of climate, and the moisture of their native soil.\nThese little creatures, all stark naked, seemed to be well enough off\nfor food, of some sort or another, but to be very badly off for want of\nwashing and covering up. And their little legs seemed to be growing\ncrooked; the meaning of which was beyond me then; until I was told that\nit took its rise from the way they were forced to crook them in, to lay\nhold of one another's legs, for the sake of natural warmth and comfort,\nas the winter-time came on, when they slept in the straw all together. I\nbelieve this was so; but I never saw it.\n\nThe Reverend John Rambone took no other notice of these people than to\nbe amused with them. He knew some two or three of the men, and spoke of\nthem by their nicknames, such as \"Browny,\" or \"Horse-hair,\" or \"Sandy\nboy;\" and the little children came crawling on their bellies to him.\nThis seemed to be their natural manner of going at an early age: and\nonly one of all the very little children walked upright. This one came\nto the Parson's horse, and being still of a tottery order, laid hold of\na fore-leg to fetch up his own; and having such moorage, looked up at\nthe horse. The horse, for his part, looked down upon him, bending his\nneck, as if highly pleased; yet with his nostrils desiring to snort, and\nthe whole of his springy leg quivering, but trying to keep quiet, lest\nthe baby might be injured. This made me look at the child again, whose\nlittle foolish life was hanging upon the behaviour of a horse. The rider\nperceived that he could do nothing, in spite of all his great strength\nand skill, to prevent the horse from dashing out the baby's brains with\nhis fore-hoof, if only he should rear or fret. And so he only soothed\nhim. But I, being up to all these things, and full for ever of presence\nof mind, slipped in under the hold of the horse, as quietly as possible,\nand in a manner which others might call at the same time daring and\ndexterous, I fetched the poor little fellow out of his dangerous\nposition.\n\n\"Well done, Taffy!\" said Parson Jack; \"I should never have thought you\nhad sense enough for it. You had a narrow shave, my man.\"\n\nFor the horse, being frightened by so much nakedness, made a most sudden\nspring over my body, before I could rise with the child in my arms; and\none of his after-hoofs knocked my hat off, so that I felt truly thankful\nnot to have had a worse business of it. But I would not let any one\nlaugh at my fright.\n\n\"A miss is as good as a mile, your Reverence. Many a cannon-ball has\npassed me nearer than your horse's hoof. Tush, a mere trifle! Will your\nReverence give this poor little man a ride?\" And with that I offered him\nthe child upon his saddlebow, naked, and unwashed, and kicking.\n\n\"Keep off, or you shall taste my horsewhip. Keep away with your dirty\nbrat--and yet--oh, poor little devil! If I only had a cloth with me!\"\n\nFor this parson was of tender nature, although so wild and reckless; and\nin his light way he was moved at the wretched plight of this small\ncreature, and the signs of heavy stripes upon him. Not all over him, as\nthe Parson said, being prone to exaggerate; but only extending over his\nback, and his hams, and other convenient places. And perhaps my jacket\nmade them smart, for he roared every time I lifted him. And every time I\nset him down, he stared with a wistful kind of wonder at our clothes,\nand at the noble horse, as if he were trying to remember something.\n\"Where can they have picked up this poor little beggar?\" said Parson\nJack, more to himself than to me: \"he looks of a different breed\naltogether. I wonder if this is one of Stoyle's damned tricks.\" And all\nthe way back he spoke never a word, but seemed to be worrying with\nhimself. But I having set the child down on his feet, and dusted my\nclothes, and cleaned myself, followed the poor little creature's toddle,\nand examined him carefully. The rest of the children seemed to hate him,\nand he, to shrink out of their way almost; and yet he was the only fine\nand handsome child among them. For in spite of all the dirt upon it, his\nface was honest, and fair, and open, with large soft eyes of a dainty\nblue, and short thick curls of yellow hair that wanted combing sadly.\nAnd though he had rolled in muddy places, as little wild children always\ndo, for the sake of keeping the cold out, his skin was white, where the\nmud had peeled, and his form lacked nothing but washing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\nIN A STATE OF NATURE.\n\n\nNow all these things contributed, coming as they did so rapidly, to\narouse inside me a burning and almost desperate curiosity. It was in\nvain that I said to myself, \"these are no concerns of mine: let them\nmanage their own affairs: the less I meddle, the better for me: I seem\nto be in a barbarous land, and I must expect things barbarous. And after\nall, what does it come to, compared with the great things I have seen,\nay, and played my part in?\" To reason thus, and regard it thus, and seek\nonly to be quit of it, was a proof of the highest wisdom any man could\nmanifest: if he could only stick to it. And this I perceived, and thus I\nfelt, and praised myself for enforcing it so; until it became not only\nsafe, but a bounden duty to reward my conscience by a little talk or so.\n\nHence I lounged into the stable-yard--for that terrible Chowne was not\nyet come back, neither were maids to be got at for talking, only that\nstony Steelyard--and there I found three or four shirt-sleeved fellows,\nhissing at horses, and rubbing away, to put their sleeping polish on\nthem, before the master should return. Also three or four more were\nlabouring in the stalls very briskly, one at a sort of holy-stoning,\nmaking patterns with brick and sand, and the others setting up the\nhammocks for the nags to lie in, with a lashing of twisted straw aft of\ntheir after-heels and taffrails, as the wake of a ship might be. And all\nof it done most ship-shape. This amused me mightily; for I never had\nseen such a thing before, even among wild horses, who have power to\nmanage their own concerns. But to see them all go in so snugly, and with\nsuch a sweet, clean savour, each to his own oats or mashings, with the\ngolden straw at foot, made me think, and forced me to it, of those\nwretched white barbarians (white, at least, just here and there), whom\ngood Parson Jack--as one might almost try to call him--had led me to\nvisit that same afternoon.\n\nPerceiving how the wind sate, I even held back, and smoked a pipe,\nexactly as if I were overseer, and understood the whole of it, yet did\nnot mean to make rash reproach. This had a fine effect upon them,\nespecially as I chewed a straw, by no means so as to stop my pipe, but\nto exhibit mastery. And when I put my leg over a rail, as if I found it\ndifficult to keep myself from horseback, the head-man came to me\nstraightforward, and asked me when I had hunted last.\n\nI told him that I was always hunting, week-days, and Sundays, and all\nthe year round, because it was our fashion; and that we hunted creatures\nsuch as he never had the luck to set eyes on. And when I had told him a\nfew more things (such as flow from experience, when mixed with\nimagination), a duller man than myself might see that he longed for me\nto sup with him. And he spoke of things that made me ready, such as\ntripe and onions.\n\nHowever, this would never do. I felt myself strongly under orders; and\nbut for this paramount sense of duty, never could I have done the things\nmodestly mentioned as of yore; and those of hereafter tenfold as fine,\nsuch as no modesty dare suppress. So, when I had explained to him\nexactly how I stood about it, he did not refuse to fill his pipe with a\nbit of my choice tobacco, and to come away from all idle folk, to a\nplace in the shelter of a rick, where he was sure to hear the hoofs of\nhis master's horse returning. I sate with him thus, and we got on well;\nand as he was going to marry soon the daughter of a publican, who had as\ngood as fifty pounds, and nothing that could be set on fire, and lived\nfifty miles away almost, he did not mind telling me all the truth,\nbecause he saw that I could keep it; and at his age he could not enter\ninto the spirit of being kicked so. I told him I should like to see a\nman kick me! But he said that I might come to it.\n\nThis was a very superior man, and I durst not contradict him; and having\narranged so to settle in life, how could he hope to tell any more lies?\nFor I have always found all men grow pugnaciously truthful, so to put\nit, for a month almost before wedlock; while the women are doing the\nopposite. However, not to go far into that, what he told me was much as\nfollows:--\n\nParson Chowne, in early life, before his mind was put into shape for\nanything but to please itself, had been dreadfully vexed and thwarted.\nEvery matter had gone amiss, directly he was concerned in it; his\nguardians had cheated him, so had his step-mother, so had his favourite\nuncle, and of course so had his lawyers done. In the thick of that\nbitterness, what did his sweetheart do but throw him over. She took a\ngreat scare of his strange black eyes, when she found that his money was\ndoubtful. This was instinct, no doubt, on her part, and may have been a\ngreat saving for her; but to him it was terrible loss. His faith was\nalready astray a little; but a dear wife might have brought it back, or\nat any rate made him think so. And he was not of the nature which gropes\nafter the bottom of everything, like a twisting augur. Having a prospect\nof good estates, he was sent to London to learn the law, after finishing\nat Oxford, not that he might practise it, but to introduce a new element\nto the county magistrates, when he should mount the bench among them.\nHere he got rogued, as was only natural, and a great part of his land\nfell from him, and therefore he took to the clerical line; and being of\na stern and decided nature, he married three wives, one after the other,\nand thus got a good deal of property. It was said, of course, as it\nalways is of any man thrice a widower, that he or his manner had killed\nhis wives; a charge which should never be made without strong evidence\nin support of it. At any rate there had been no children; and different\nopinions were entertained whether this were the cause or effect of the\nParson's dislike and contempt of little ones. Moreover, as women usually\nare of a tougher staple than men can be, Chowne's successive liberation\nfrom three wives had added greatly to his fame for witchcraft, such as\nfirst accrued from his commanding style, nocturnal habits, method of\nquenching other people, and collection of pots and kettles. The\nhead-groom told me, with a knowing wink, that in his opinion the Parson\nwas now looking after wife No. 4, for he never had known him come out so\nsmart with silver heels and crested head-piece, and even the mark of the\nsaddle must not show upon his breeches. This was a sure sign, he\nthought, that there was a young lady in the wind, possessing both money\nand good looks, such as Chowne was entitled to, and always had insisted\non. Upon that point I could have thrown some light (if prudence had\npermitted it), or at least I had some shrewd suspicions, after what\nhappened beside the river; however, I said nothing. But I asked him what\nin his opinion first had soured the young man Chowne against the whole\nof the world so sadly, as he seemed to retain it now. And he answered me\nthat he could not tell, inasmuch as the cause which he had heard given\nseemed to him to be most unlikely, according to all that he saw of the\nman. Nevertheless I bade him tell it, being an older man than he was,\nand therefore more able to enter into what young folk call\n\"inconsistencies.\" And so he told me that it was this. Chowne, while\nstill a young boy, had loved, with all the force of his heart, a boy a\nfew years younger than himself, a cousin of his own, but not with\nprospects such as he had. And this boy had been killed at school, and\nthe matter hushed up comfortably among all high authorities. But Stoyle\nChowne had made a vow to discover and hunt it out to the uttermost, and\nsooner or later to have revenge. But when his own wrongs fell upon him,\ndoubtless he had forgotten it. I said that I did not believe he had done\nso, or ever would, to the uttermost.\n\nThen I asked about Parson Jack, and heard pretty much what I expected.\nThat he was a well-meaning man enough, although without much sense of\nright or wrong, until his evil star led him into Parson Chowne's\nsociety. But still he had instincts now and then, such as a horse has,\nof the right road; and an old woman of his church declared that he did\nfeel his own sermons, and if let alone, and listened to, might come to\nact up to them. I asked whether Parson Chowne might do the like, but was\ntold that he never preached any.\n\nWe were talking thus, and I had quite agreed to his desire of my company\nfor supper-time, when the sound of a horse upon stony ground, tearing\nalong at a dangerous speed, quite broke up our conference. The groom, at\nthe sound of it, damped out his pipe, and signified to me to do the\nsame.\n\n\"I have fired a-many of his enemies' ricks,\" he whispered, in his haste\nand fright; \"but if he were to smell me a-smoking near to a rick of his\nown, good Lord!\" and he pointed to a hay-rope, as if he saw his halter.\nAnd though he had boasted of speedy marriage, and caring no fig for\nParson Chowne, he set off for the stables at a pace likely to prove\ninjurious to his credit for consistency.\n\nOn the other hand, I, in a leisurely manner, picked myself up from the\nattitude natural to me when listening kindly, and calmly asserting my\nright to smoke, approached the track by which I knew that the rider must\ncome into the yard; for all the dogs had no fear of me now, by virtue of\nthe whistle which I bore. And before I had been there half a minute, the\nParson dashed up with his horse all smoking, and himself in a heavy\nblackness of temper, such as I somehow expected of him.\n\n\"No Jack here! not a Jack to be seen. Have the kindness to look for my\nstable-whip. Ho, Llewellyn is it?\"\n\n\"Yes, your Reverence, David Llewellyn, once of his Majesty's Royal Navy,\nand now of----\"\n\n\"No more of that! You have played me false. I expected it from a rogue\nlike you. Restore me that trust-guinea.\"\n\nThis so largely differed from what even Anthony Stew would dare to say\nin conversation with me (much less at times of evidence), that I lifted\nup my heart to heaven, as two or three preachers had ordered me; and\neven our parson had backed it up, with lineage at least as good and\nperhaps much better than Parson Chowne's, by right of Welsh blood under\nit: the whole of this overcame me so, that I could only say, \"What\nguinea, sir?\"\n\n\"What guinea, indeed! You would rob me, would you? Don't you know better\nthan that, my man? Come to me in two hours' time. Stop, give me that\ndog's whistle!\"\n\nTaking that heed of me, and no more, he cast the reins to my friend the\nhead-groom, who came up, looking for all the world as if never had he\nseen me, and wondered strangely who I could be. And this air of fright\nand denial always pervaded the whole household. All of which was quite\nagainst what I had been long accustomed to, wherever I deigned to go in\nwith my news to the servants' place, or the housekeeper's room, or\nanywhere pointed out to me as the best for entertainment. Here, however,\nalthough the servants seemed to be plentiful enough, and the horses and\nthe hounds to have as much as they could eat, there was not a trace of\nwhat I may call good domestic comfort. When this prevails, as it ought\nto do in every gentleman's household, the marks may be discovered in the\neyes and the mouth of everybody. Nobody thinks of giving way to\ninjudicious hurry when bells ring, or when shouts are heard, or horses'\nfeet at the front door. And if on the part of the carpeted rooms any\ndisquietude is shown, or desire to play, or feed, or ride, at times\noutside the convenience of the excellent company down-stairs, there is\nnothing more to be said, except that it cannot be done, and should never\nin common reason have been thought of. For all servants must enjoy their\nmeals, and must have time to digest them with proper ease for\nconversation and expansion afterwards. At Candleston Court it was always\nso; and so it should be everywhere.\n\nHowever, to return to my groom, whose cordiality revived at the moment\nhis master turned the corner, perceiving that Chowne had some matter on\nhand which would not allow him to visit the stables, just for the\npresent at any rate, he turned the black mare over to the care of an\nunderstrapper, and with a wink and a smack of his lips, gave me to know\nthat his supper was toward. Neither were we disappointed, but found it\nall going on very sweetly, in a little private room used for cleaning\nharness. And he told me that this young cook maid, of unusual abilities,\nhad attached herself to him very strongly, with an eye to promotion, and\nhaving no scent of his higher engagement: neither would he have been\nunwilling to carry out her wishes if she could only have shown a\nsixpence against the innkeeper's daughter's shilling. I told him that he\nwas too romantic, and he said with a sigh that he could not help it; but\nall would come right in the end, no doubt.\n\nThis honest affection impressed me not a little in his favour, and in\nless than half an hour I found him a thoroughly worthy fellow: while he\nperceived, through a square-stalked rummer, that my character was\ncongenial. I told him therefore some foreign stories, many of which were\nexceedingly true, and he by this time was ready to answer almost\nanything that I chose to ask, even though he knew nothing about it. As\nfor the people that wore no clothes, but lived all together in the old\nmud-house, there need be and could be no mystery. Every one knew that\nhis Reverence had picked them up in his early days, and been pleased\nwith their simple appearance and dislike of cultivation. Perceiving even\nthen how glad he might be, in after-life, to annoy his neighbours, what\ndid he do but bring these people (then six in number, and all of them\nwives and husbands to one another) and persuade them to dig themselves\nout a house, and by deed of gift establish them on forty acres of their\nown land, so that, as Englishmen love to say, their house was now their\ncastle. Not that these were perhaps English folk, but rather of a Gipsy\ncross, capable, however, of becoming white if a muscular man should\nscrub them. The groom said that nobody durst go near them, except Parson\nChowne and Parson Jack, and that they seemed to get worse and worse, as\nthey began to be persecuted by clothes-wearing people. I asked him what\ntheir manners were; and he said he believed they were good enough, so\nlong as not interfered with; and who could blame them for maintaining\nthat whether they wore clothes or not was entirely their own concern:\nalso, that if outer strangers intruded, from motives of low curiosity,\nupon their unclad premises, it was only fair to point out to them the\ndisadvantages of costume, by making it very hard to wash? There was some\nsense in this, because the main anxiety of mankind is to convert one\nanother; and the pelting of mud is usually the beginning of such\novertures. And these fine fellows having recurred (as Parson Chowne\nsaid) to a natural state, their very first desire would be to redeem all\nfellow-creatures from the evils of civilisation. Whereof the foremost\nperhaps is clothes, and the time we take in dressing--a twelfth part of\ntheir waking life, with even the wisest women, and with the unwise\nvirgins, often not less than three-quarters; and with many men not much\nbetter.--But to come back to my savages. I asked this good groom how it\ncame to pass that none of the sheriffs, or deputies, or even magistrates\nof the shire, put down this ungoodly company. He said that they had\ntried, but failed, according to the laws of England, on the best\nauthority. Because these men of the ancient Adam went back to the time\nbefore the beasts had come to Adam to get their names. They brought up\ntheir children without a name, and now all names were dying out, and\nthey agreed much better in consequence. And how could any writ, warrant,\nor summons, run against people without a name? It had once been tried\nwith a \"Nesho Kiss,\" the meaning of which was beyond me; but Parson\nChowne upset that at once; and the bailiff was fit to make bricks of.\n\nAt this I shook my head and smiled; because we put up with many evils on\nour side of the water, but never with people so unbecoming in their\nmanner of life and clothes. And I thought how even mild Colonel Lougher\nwould have behaved upon such a point, and how sharp Anthony Stew would\nhave stamped when they began to pelt him; and how I wished him there to\ntry it!\n\nNevertheless I desired to know what victuals these good barbarians had;\nbecause, although like the Indian Jogis (mentioned by some great\ntraveller) they might prove their right to go without clothes, which\nnever were born upon them, they could not to my mind prove their power\nto do so well without victuals. He answered that this was a clever thing\non my part to inquire about; but that I was so far wrong that these\npeople would eat anything. His Reverence sent them every week the refuse\nof his garden, as well as of stable-yard and kennel, and they had a gift\nof finding food in everything around them. Their favourite dish--so to\nsay, when they had never a dish among them--was what they discovered in\nthe pasture-land; and this they divided carefully; accounting it the\ndepth of shame, and the surest mark of civilisation, to cheat one\nanother. But they could not expect to get this every day, in a\nneighbourhood of moorland; therefore, instead of grumbling, they did\ntheir best to get on without it. And Providence always sends thousands\nof victuals for all whose stomachs have not been ruined by thinking too\nmuch about them; or very likely through the women beginning to make them\ndelicate. So when a man is sea-sick, he thinks of and hates almost\neverything.\n\nOn the other hand, these noble fellows hated nothing that could be\nchewed. Twenty-one sorts of toad-stool, with the insects which inhabit\nthem; three varieties of eft, and of frogs no less than seven; also\nslugs six inches long, too large to have a house built; moles that live\nin lines of decks, like a man-of-war's-man; also rats, and brindled\nhedgehogs, and the grubs of hornets (which far surpass all\noysters)--these, and other little things, like goat-moths, leopards, and\nmoney-grubs, kept them so alive as never to come down on the parish.\nNeither was there any hen-roost, rick-yard, apple-room, or dairy, on the\nfarms around them, but in it they found nourishment. Into all this I\ncould enter, while the groom only showed the door of it.\n\nBut while we were talking thus, I heard the stable-clock strike eight,\nwhich brought Hezekiah to my mind, and my own church-clock at Newton. It\nstruck in such a manner, that I saw the door of my own cottage, also\nBunny in bed, with her nostrils ready to twitch for snoring, and Mother\nJones, with a candle, stooping to ease her by means of a drop of hot\ngrease; and inside, by the wall, lay Bardie, sleeping (as she always\nslept) with a smile of high-born quietude. And what would all three say\nto me if ever I got back again?\n\nThanking this excellent groom for all his hospitality to me, and\npromising at his desire to keep it from his master, I took my way (as\npointed out) to the room where his Reverence might be found. I feared\nthat his temper would be black, unless he had dined as I had supped, and\ntaken a good glass afterwards. And I could not believe what the groom\nhad told me concerning one particular. There is a most utterly pestilent\nrace arising, and growing up around us, whose object is to destroy old\nEngland, by forbidding a man to drink. St Paul speaks against them, and\nall the great prophets; and the very first thing that was done by our\nLord, after answering them in the Temple, was to put them to shame with\na great many firkins. Also one of the foremost parables is concerning\nbottles, as especially honest things (while bushels are to the\ncontrary), and the tendency of all Scripture is such--whichever\nTestament you take--that no man in his wits can doubt it. And though I\nnever read the Koran, and only have heard some verses of it, I know\nenough to say positively, that Mahomet began this movement to establish\nAntichrist.\n\nHowever, my groom said that Parson Chowne, though not such a fool as to\nstop other people, scarcely ever took a drop himself; and his main\ndelight was to make low beasts of the clergy who had no self-command.\nAnd two or three years ago he had played a trick on his brother parsons,\nsuch as no man would ever have tried who took his own glass in\nmoderation and enjoyed it heartily, as Scripture even commands us to do,\nto promote good-fellowship and discretion. Having a power of visitation,\nfrom some faculty he enjoyed, he sent all round to demand their presence\nat a certain time, for dinner. All the parsons were glad enough,\nespecially as their wives could not, in good manners, be invited,\nbecause there was now no Mrs Chowne. And they saw a rare chance to tell\ngood stories, and get on without the little snaps which are apt to occur\namong ladies. Therefore they all appeared in strength, having\nrepresented it as a high duty, whatever their better halves might think.\nWhen a parson says this, his wife must knock under, or never go to\nchurch again. Being there, they were treated well, and had the good\ndinner they all deserved, and found their host very different from what\nthey had been led to expect of him. He gave them as much wine as they\nneeded, and a very good wine too. He let them tell their stories, though\nhis own taste was quite different; and he even humoured them so as to\nlaugh the while he was despising them. And though he could not bear\ntobacco, that and pipes were brought in for them.\n\nAll went smoothly until one of them, edged on by the others, called for\nspirits and hot water. This Master Chowne had prepared for, of course,\nand meant to present the things in good time; but now being gored thus\nin his own house, the devil entered into him. His dark face grew of a\nleaden colour, while he begged their pardon. Then out he went to Mother\nSteelyard, and told her exactly what to do. Two great jacks of brown\nbrandy came in, and were placed upon the table, and two silver kettles\nupon the hobs. He begged all his guests to help themselves, showing the\nlemons and sugar-caddy, the bottles, and kettles, and everything: and\nthen he left them to their own devices, while he talked with Parson\nJack, who had dropped in suddenly.\n\nNow, what shall I tell you came to pass--as a very great traveller\nalways says--why, only that these parsons grew more drunk than despair,\nor even hope. Because, in the silver kettles was not water, but whisky\nat boiling-point, and the more they desired to weaken their brandy, the\nmore they fortified it: until they tumbled out altogether, in every\nstate of disorder. For this he had prepared, by placing at the foot of\nhis long steps half-a-dozen butts of liquid from the cleaning of his\ndrains, meant to be spread on the fields next day. And into the whole of\nthis they fell, and he bolted the doors upon them.\n\nThis made a stir in the clerical circles, when it came to be talked\nabout; but upon reference to the bishop, he thought they had better say\nnothing about it, only be more considerate. And on the whole it\nredounded greatly to the credit of Parson Chowne.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nWAITING AND LEARNING.\n\n\nWhat this great man now said to me had better not be set down perhaps;\nbecause it proved him incapable of forming due estimate of my character.\nEnough that he caused me some alarm and considerable annoyance by his\nsupercilious vein, and assumption of evil motives. Whereas you could not\nfind anywhere purer or loftier reasons, and I might say, more poetical\nones, than those which had led me to abstain from speaking of the fair\nyoung lady. However, as this Chowne had learned all about her, from some\nskulking landsman, whom he maintained as a spy at the back of the\npremises, it was certain that I could in no way harm her, by earning a\ntrifle of money in front, in a thoroughly open and disciplined way. And\nit might even lie in my power thereby to defeat the devices of enemies,\nand rescue this beautiful young female from any one who would dare to\nthink of presuming to injure her.\n\nI found my breast and heart aglow with all the fine feeling of younger\ndays, the moment the above occurred to me; and it would not have cost me\ntwo blows to knock down any man who misunderstood me. However, his\nReverence did not afford me any chance for this exercise; but seemed to\nallow me the benefit which such ideas afford a man; and promised to\ngive me three half-crowns, instead of five shillings a week, as before.\n\nHe allowed me a hay-loft to sleep in that night, after taking good care\nthat I had not even a flint to strike a light with. For, cordially as he\ndid enjoy the firing of an enemy's barns or stacks, his Reverence never\ncould bear the idea of so much as a spark coming near his own. And the\nfollowing morning I saddled my horse, with a good chain undergirding,\nand taking turn and turn about, got home to the Rose of Devon.\n\nAnd here I found very unjust work, Fuzzy gone, and Ike not to be found,\nand the ketch laid up for the winter. Only Bang, the boy, was left, and\nthe purpose of his remaining was to bear me a wicked message. Namely,\nthat I had been so much away, both in the boat and on horseback, that\nthe captain would not be bound to me, except to get home again, how I\nmight. And if this could not be brought about, and I chose to take care\nof the ketch for the winter, two shillings a-week was what I might draw,\nalso the wood on the wharf, so long as it would last for firing; and any\nfish I could catch with lines; and any birds I could shoot on the river,\nwith a stone of rock-powder that was in the hold.\n\nBang was ashamed to deliver this message; and I cannot describe to you\nmy wrath, as slowly I wrung it out of him. His head went into his neck\nalmost, for fear of my taking it by the handles, which nature had\nprovided in his two ears, and letting him learn (as done once before)\nthat the mast had harder knots in it. But I always scorn injustice; and\nBang was not to be blamed for this. So I treated him kindly; as I might\nwish a boy of my own to be treated by a man of large experience. And I\nlet him go home to his mother's house, which was said to be somewhere\nwithin a league, and then I went to see what manners had been shown in\nthe pickling-tub.\n\nHere I found precious little indeed, and only the bottom stuff of\ncoxcombs, tails, and nails, and over-harpings, thready bits, and\ntapeworm stuff, such as we pray deliverance from, unless it comes to\nfamine. Nevertheless, in my now condition I grieved that there was not\nmore of it. Because how could I get across to my native land again? All\nthe small coasting-craft were laid up, as if they were china for\nshelfing, immediately after that gale of wind, which (but for me) must\nhave capsized us. These fellows up the rivers never get a breath of\nseamanship. Sudden squalls are all they think of. Sea room, and the\npower of it, they would be afraid of.\n\nAt one time I thought of walking home, because none of these traders\nwould venture it; and if I had only a guinea to start with on the road\nto Bristol, nothing could have stopped me. For, say what I might to\nmyself about it, and reason however carefully, I could not reconcile\nwith my conscience these things that detained me. The more I considered\nonly three half-crowns, and the mere chance of wild-ducks on the river,\nthe less I perceived how my duty lay, and the more it appeared to be\nmovable. And why was I bound to stop here like this, when their place\nwas to take me home again, according to stipulation? To apply to the\nmayor, as I knew, was useless, especially now that I owed him a bill; as\nfor the bench of magistrates, one had already a bias against me, because\nI went into a wood one night to watch an eclipse of the moon, and took\nmy telescope; which they all swore was a gun! Being disappointed with\nthe moon's proceedings, I slammed up my telescope hastily, and at the\nsame time puffed my pipe; and there was a fellow on watch so vile as to\nswear to the sound and the smoke of a gun! And this fellow proved to be\na Welshman of the name of Llewellyn, and a cousin of mine within seven\ngenerations! I acquit him of knowing this fact at the time; and when in\ncross-examination I let him know it, and nobody else, he came back to\nhis duty, and swore white all the black he had sworn before.\nNevertheless I did not like it (though acquitted amidst universal\napplause) on account of the notoriety; and finding him one night upon\nthe barge walk, and his manners irritating, I was enabled to impress him\nwith a sense of consanguinity. And after that I might bear my telescope,\nand take observations throughout the coverts, whenever the pheasants did\nnot disturb me.\n\nThis privilege, and a flight of wild-ducks, followed by a team of geese,\nand rumours even of two wild swans, moderated my desire to be back at\nhome again. There no man can get a shot, except in very bitter weather,\nor when the golden plovers come in, unless he likes to take on himself a\nstrong defiance of public opinion. Because Colonel Lougher is so kind,\nand so forbears to prosecute, that to shoot his game is no game at all,\nand shames almost any man afterwards. And the glory of all that\nnight-work is, the sense of wronging somebody.\n\nMoreover, a little thing occurred, which, in my doubt of conclusion, led\nme to stay a bit longer. Some people may think nothing of it, but a kind\ntouch takes a hold on me. I have spoken of a boy, by the name of Bang,\npossessing many good qualities, yet calling for education. Of this I\nhad given him some little, administered not to his head alone, but to\nmore influential quarters; and the result was a crop of gratitude\nwatered by humility. When he went home for the winter months, I expected\nto hear no more of him, having been served in that manner often by boys\nwhom I have corrected. Therefore all who have ever observed the want of\nthankfulness in the young, will enter into my feelings when an ancient\nwoman, Bang's grandmother, hailed me in a shaky voice over the side of\nmy ketch, with Bang in the distance watching her. Between her feet was a\ngood large basket, which with my usual fine feeling I leaped out to ease\nher of. But on no account would she let me touch it, until she knew more\nabout me.\n\n\"Be you the man?\" she said.\n\n\"Madam,\" I answered, \"I be the man.\"\n\n\"The man as goes on so wicked to Bang, for the sake of his soul\nhereafter?\"\n\n\"Yes, madam, I am he who clothed in the wholesome garb of severity a\ndeep and parental affection;\" for now I smelled something uncommonly\ngood.\n\n\"Be you the chap as wolloped him?\"\n\n\"That I can proudly say I am.\"\n\n\"Look 'e see, here, this be for 'e, then!\"\n\nWith no common self-approval, I observed what she turned out; although I\nlonged much to unpack them myself, for fear of her spoiling anything.\nBut she put me back in a wholesale manner, and spread it all out like a\nmarket-stand. And really it was almost enough to make a market of; for\nshe was a very wiry old woman, and Bang had helped carry, as far as the\nwharf, when he saw me, and fled. Especially did I admire a goose, fat\nwith golden fat upon him, trussed, and laid on stuffing-herbs. Also, a\nlittle pig for roasting, too young to object to it, yet with his\ncharacter formed enough to make his brains delicious. And as for\nsausages--but no more.\n\nThe goodness of these things preserved me from going off on the tramp\njust yet. That is the last thing a sailor should do, though gifted with\nan iron-tipped wooden leg. The Government drove me into it once, when my\nwound allowed me to be discharged; but it took more out of my\nself-respect than ever I have recovered. And if I do anything under the\nmark (which, to my knowledge, I never do), it dates from the time the\nKing drove me to alms. However, I never do dwell upon that, unless\nthere is something wrong down in my hold; and when that is right, I am\nthankful again. And none of that ever befalls me, when I get my rations\nregular. But who cares to hear any more about me, with all these great\nthings coming on? You may look on me now as nobody.\n\nBecause I fell so much beneath my own idea of myself, and all that\nothers said of me, through my nasty want of strength, when Parson Chowne\ncame over me. It is easy enough to understand that a man, in\ngood-nature, may knock under to another man of good-nature also; all in\nfriendship and in fun, and for the benefit of the world. But for a man\nof intellect not so very far under the average--as will now be admitted\nof me, in spite of all inborn diffidence--as well as a man of a\ncharacter formed and framed by experience, now to be boarded and\nviolently driven under hatches, without any power to strike a blow, by a\nman who was never on board of a ship--at any rate to my knowledge; to\nthink of this and yet not help it, made me chafe like a fellow in irons.\n\nThere was one thing, however, that helped to make me put up with my\npresent position a little, and that was my hope to be truly of service\nto my genuine benefactor, poor Sir Philip Bampfylde. This old gentleman\nclearly was not going on very comfortably; and Parson Chowne had given\nme to understand, without any words, that the great chest landed at the\nend of his house, was full of arms and all other treason. These were to\nbe smuggled in, after the Captain's departure; and the Captain would not\nenter the house, through fear of the servants suspecting something.\n\nI could not reconcile this account with what I had seen the young lady\ndo, and the Captain's mode of receiving it; but as I would not tell the\nParson a word about that young lady, I could not make that objection to\nhim. Nor did I say, though I might have done so, that I would not and\ncould not believe for a moment that any British naval captain would\nemploy his ship and crew for a purpose of high treason to his lawful\nmaster. That Parson Chowne should dare to think that I would swallow\nsuch stuff as that, made me angry with myself for not having\ncontradicted him. But all this time I was very wise, and had no call to\nreproach myself. Seldom need any man repent for not having said more\nthan he did; and never so needeth a Welshman.\n\nAnd now, though I still took observation of Narnton Court (as in honour\nbound to deserve my salary), and though the Parson still rode down, and\nwent the round of the deck at times when nobody could expect him; yet it\nwas not in my nature to be kept from asking something as to all these\npeople. You may frighten a man, and scare his wits, and keep him under,\nand trample on him, and even beat his feelers down, and shut him up like\na jellyfish; but, after all this, if he is a man, he will want to know\nthe reason. For this makes half of the difference between man and the\nlower animals:--the latter, when punished, accept it as a thing that\nmust befall them; and so do the negroes, and all proper women: but a man\nalways wants to know why it must be; though it greatly increases his\ntrouble to ask, and still more to tell it again, if you please.\n\nSir Philip Bampfylde, as every one said, was a very nice gentleman\nindeed, the head of an ancient family, and the owner of a large estate.\nKind, moreover, and affable, though perhaps a little stately, from\nhaving long held high command and important rank in the army. Some years\nago he had attained even to the rank of general, which is the same thing\namong land-forces as an admiral is with us; and he was so proud of this\nposition that he always wished to be so addressed, rather than by the\ntitle which had been so long in the family. For his argument was that he\nhad to thank good fortune for being a baronet, whereas good conduct and\nperseverance alone could have made him a general. Now if these had made\nhim an admiral, I would always entitle him so; as it is, I shall call\nhim \"Sir Philip,\" or \"General,\" just as may happen to come to my mind.\nNow this gentleman had two sons, and no other children; the elder was\nPhilip Bampfylde, Esquire, and the younger Captain Drake Bampfylde, of\nwhom I have spoken already. Philip, the heir, had been appointed to\nmanage the family property, which spread for miles and miles away; and\nthis gave him quite enough to do, because his father for years and years\nwas away on foreign service. And during this time Squire Philip married\na lady of great beauty, sent home by his father from foreign parts after\nrescue from captivity. She was of very good extraction, so far as\nforeigners can be, and a princess (they said) in her own right, though\nwithout much chance of getting it. And she spoke the prettiest broken\nEnglish, being very sensitive.\n\nWell, everything thus far went purely enough, and the lady had brought\nhim a pair of twins, and was giving good promise of going on, and\neverybody was pleased with her, and most of all her husband, and Sir\nPhilip was come home from governorship, but only on leave of absence,\nand they were trying hard to persuade him now to retire and live in\npeace, when who should come with his evil luck to spoil everything, but\nDrake Bampfylde? How it came to pass was not clearly known, at least to\nthe folk on our side of the river, or those whom I met in Barnstaple.\nAnd I durst not ask on the further side, that is to say around Narnton\nCourt, because the Parson's spies were there. Only the old women felt\npretty sure that they had heard say, though it might be wrong, that\nCaptain Drake Bampfylde had drowned the children, some said by accident,\nsome said on purpose, and buried them somewhere on Braunton Burrows. And\nthe effect of this on the foreign lady, being as she was, poor thing,\nmight have been foreseen almost. For she fell into untimely pains, and\nneither herself nor her babe survived, exactly as happened to my son's\nwife.\n\nThis was a very sad story, I thought, but they said that the worst of it\nstill lay behind: for poor Squire Philip had been so upset by the hurry\nof all these misfortunes, that nobody knew what to do with him. He\nalways had been a most warm-hearted man, foolishly fond of his wife and\nchildren, and of a soft and retiring nature. Moreover, he looked on his\nyounger brother, who had seen so much more of the world than himself,\nand was of a bolder character, not with an elder son's usual\ncarelessness, but with a thorough admiration. And when he found him\nbehave in this manner (according, at least, to what every one said), and\nall for the sake of the property, without a sharp word between them, it\nwent to his heart, in the thick of his losses, so that he was beside\nhimself. He let his beard grow and his hair turn white, although he was\nnot yet forty, and he put up the shutters of his room, and kept candles\naround him, and little dolls. He refused to see his brother Drake, and\nhis father Sir Philip, and everybody, except his own attendant, and the\nnurse of his poor children. And finding this, the Captain left the\nhouse, as if cursed out of it.\n\nThe only one who took things bravely was the ancient General. Much as he\ngrieved at the loss of his race, and extinction, perhaps, of the family,\nhe swore that he never would be cast down, or doubt the honour of his\nfavourite son, until that son confessed it. This Drake Bampfylde had\nnever done, although the case was hard against him, and scarcely any\none, except his father, now stood up for him. But of the few who still\nheld him guiltless, was one especial comforter: Isabel Carey to wit, a\nyoung lady of very good Devonshire family, left as a ward to Sir Philip\nBampfylde, and waiting for three or four years more of age, to come into\nlarge estates in South Devon.\n\nThe general people did not know this; but I happened to get ahead of\nthem; and having a knack in my quiet way of putting two and two\ntogether, also having seen the Captain, and shaped my opinions, I would\nhave staked my boat against a cuttle-fish that he was quite innocent. If\nthe children were found buried--although I could never quite get at\nthis, but only a story of a man who had seen him doing it, as I shall\ntell hereafter--but even supposing them deep in the sand (which I was a\nlittle inclined to do, from trusting my spy-glass so thoroughly), yet\nthere might have been other people quite as likely to put them there as\nthat unlucky Captain Drake.\n\nIt has been my lot to sail under a great many various captains, not only\nwhom I have hinted at in the days when I was too young for work, but\nwhom I mean to describe hereafter in my far greater experiences; really\nfinding (although I have tried to convince people to the contrary) that\nwhat they have told me was perfectly true, and that I come out far\nstronger and better whenever my reins are tried and proved; and my loins\nas sound as a bell, although hereditary from King David. Let that pass.\nI find one fault, and it is the only one to be found with me; it is that\nthe style of our bards will come out, and spread me abroad in their\nlofty allusions.\n\nTo come back to these captains. I never found one who would do such a\nthing as kill and slay two children, much less dig their graves in the\nsand, and come home to dinner afterwards. And of all the captains I had\nseen, Drake Bampfylde seemed as unfit as any to do a thing of that\ndirtiness. However, as I have not too much trust in human nature (after\nthe way it has used me, and worst of all when in the Government), I said\nto myself that it was important to know at what time this Captain\nBampfylde won the love of that fine Miss Carey. Because, after that, he\nhad no temptation to put the little ones out of the way; and I quite\nsettled it in my own mind, that if they had set up their horses\ntogether, before the young children went out of the world, Captain Drake\nBampfylde was not likely to have made them go so. For that fair maiden's\nestates, I was told, would feed four hundred people.\n\nNo one had seen this, exactly as I did, nor could I beat it into them;\nand I found from one or two symptoms that it was high time for me to\nleave off talking. Parson Chowne came down one night, as black as a\ntarred thunderbolt, and though he said nothing to let me know, I felt\nafraid of his meaning. Also Parson Jack rode down, in his headlong\ncareless way, and filled his pipe from my tobacco-bag, and gave me a\nwink, and said, \"Keep your mouth shut.\" It was always a pleasure to me\nto behold him; whatever his principles may have been, and if I could\nhave said a word to stop him from his downward road, or to make it go\nless sudden, goodness knows I would have done it, at the risk of three\nhalf-crowns a-week.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\nTHE POLITE FERRYMAN.\n\n\nNow, for a man of my age and knowledge, keeping an eye on his own\nconcerns, and under the eyes of a good many women (eager to have him,\nbecause confessed superior to the neighbourhood, yet naturally doubtful\nhow much money would be wanted), for such a man to attend to things\nwhich could not concern him in any way, without neglecting what now he\nhad found a serious matter at his time of life--this, to my mind, proves\na breadth of sympathy rarely found outside of Wales.\n\nEntering into these things largely, and desiring to do my best, having,\nmoreover, nought else to do except among dabs and flounders, I was led\nby a naturally active mind to try to turn a penny; not for my own good\nso much as for the use of Bunny. Therefore, having the punt at command,\nand a good pair of oars, and a good pair of arms, what did I do but set\nup a ferry, such as had never been heard of before, and never might have\nbeen dreamed of, except for my intelligence? Because we had two miles to\nBarnstaple Bridge, and no bridge at all to be found below us, and a good\nmany houses here and there, on either side of the river. And I saw that\nthey must know one another, and were longing to dine or to gossip\ntogether, except for the water between them, or the distance to walk all\nthe way by the bridge. So being left in this desolate state, and\nshamefully treated by Captain Fuzzy, and Bang's grandmother now\nneglecting me, at a period of sadness, while smoking a pipe, Providence\ngave me this brilliant idea.\n\nI never had dreamed for a moment of settling without something\npermanent; and not even \u00c2\u00a330 a-year would tempt me to do any despite to\nmy late dear wife's remembrance. A year and a day at the very least was\nI resolved to mourn for her: still, as the time was drawing on, I\ndesired to have some prospect. Not to settle rashly, as young people do\nin such affairs (which really should be important), but to begin to feel\nabout, and put the price against the weight, and then take time to think\nabout it. Only I had made up my mind not to look twice at the very\nrichest and most beautiful Methodist. Enough had I had for my life of\nthem, and the fellows that come after them: Church of England, or Church\nof Rome, for me this time at any rate; with preference to the latter\nbecause having no chapel in our neighbourhood.\n\nAnd I worked this ferry, if you will believe me, not for the sake of the\ntwopence both ways, half so much as because of my thoughts of the\nconfidence that I must create. I knew for I won't say forty years, but\nat any rate good thirty, what women are the very moment they must needs\ncome into a boat. The very shyest and wisest of them are at the mercy of\na man right out. And I never could help believing that they come for\nthat very reason. I know all their queerness of placing their toes, and\nhow they fetch their figures up, and manage to hitch their petticoats,\nand try to suppose they are quite on a balance, and then go down plump\non the nearest thwart, and pretend that they did it on purpose.\nNevertheless they are very good; and we are bound to make the best of\nthem.\n\nWhen I told Parson Chowne of my ferry-boat, rather than let him find it\nout, which of course must have happened immediately, a quick gleam of\nwrath at my daring to do such a thing without consulting him moved in\nthe depth of his great black eyes. At least I believed so, but was not\nsure; for I never could bear to look straight at his eyes, as I do to\nall other people, especially Anthony Stew, Esquire. I thought that my\nferry would be forbidden; but with his usual quickness he saw that it\nmight serve his purpose in several ways. Because it would help to keep\nme there, as well as account for my being there, and afford me the best\nchance in the world of watching the river traffic. So he changed his\nfrown to an icy smile, such as I never could smile at, and said--\n\n\"Behold now what good-luck comes of my service! Only remember, no fares\nto be taken when the tide serves for you know what. And especially no\ngossiping.\"\n\nThis being settled to my content, I took a great peace of loose\ntarpaulin out of the hold of the Rose of Devon, and with a bucket of\nthick lime-whiting explained to the public in printing letters, each as\nlarge as a marlinspike, who I was, and of what vocation, and how\nthoroughly trustworthy. And let any one read it, and then give opinion\nin common fairness, whether any man capable of being considered a spy\nwould ever have done such a thing as this:--\n\n\"David Llewellyn, Mariner of the Royal Navy, Ferryman to King George the\nIIId. Each way or both ways only Twopence. Ladies put carefully over the\nMud. Live Fish on hand at an hour's notice, and of the choicest\nQuality.\" This last statement was not quite so accurate as I could have\ndesired. To oblige the public, I kept the fish too long on hand\noccasionally, because I never had proper notice when it might be wanted.\nAnd therefore no reasonable person ever took offence at me.\n\nOne fine day towards the frosty time, who should appear at my\nlanding-stage on the further side of the river, just by the lime-kiln\nnot far from the eastern end of Narnton Court--who but a beautiful young\nlady with her maid attending her? The tide was out, and I was crossing\nwith a good sixpennyworth, that being all that my boat would hold,\nunless it were of children. And seeing her there, I put on more speed,\nso as not to keep her waiting. When I had carried my young women over\nthe mud and received their twopences, I took off my hat to the fair\nyoung lady, who had kept in the background, and asked to what part I\nmight have the honour of conveying her ladyship.\n\n\"I am not a ladyship,\" she answered, with a beautiful bright smile; \"I\nam only a common lady; and I think you must be an Irishman.\"\n\nThis I never am pleased to hear, because those Irish are so untruthful;\nhowever, I made her another fine bow, and let her have her own way about\nit.\n\n\"Then, Mr Irishman,\" she continued; \"you are so polite, we will cross\nthe water. No, no, thank you,\" as I offered to carry her; \"you may carry\nNanette, if she thinks proper. Nanette has the greatest objection to\nmud; but I am not quite so particular.\" And she tripped with her little\nfeet over the bank too lightly to break the green cake of the ooze.\n\n\"You sall elave me, my good man,\" said Nanette, who was rather a pretty\nFrench girl; \"Mamselle can afford to defigure her dress; but I can no\nsuch thing do at all.\"\n\nMeanwhile the young lady was in the boat, sitting in the stern-sheets\nlike a lieutenant, and laughing merrily at Nanette, who was making the\nprettiest fuss in the world, not indeed with regard to her legs, which\nan English girl would have considered first, but as to her frills and\nfripperies; and smelling my quid, she had no more sense than to call me\na coachman, or something like it. However, I took little heed of her,\nalthough her figure was very good; for I knew that she could not have\nsixpence, and scarcely a hundred a-year would induce me to degrade\nmyself down to a real French wife. For how could I expect my son ever to\nbe a sailor?\n\nNow as I pulled, and this fine young lady, who clearly knew something\nabout a boat, nodded her head to keep time with me, and showed her white\nteeth as she smiled at herself, my own head was almost turned, I\ndeclare; and I must have blushed, if it could have been that twenty\nyears of the fish-trade had left that power in me. Because this young\nlady was so exactly what my highest dreams of a female are, and never\nyet realised in my own scope. And her knowledge of a boat, and courage,\nand pleasant contempt of that French chit who had dared to call me a\n\"coachman,\" when added to her way of looking over the water with fine\nfeeling (such as I very often have, and must have shown it long ago),\nalso the whole of this combined with a hat of a very fine texture\nindeed, such as I knew for Italian, and a feather that curled over\ngolden pennon of hair in the wind like a Spanish ensign; and not only\nthese things, but a face, and manner, and genuine beauty of speech, not\nto be found in a million of women,--after dwelling on all these things\nboth steadily and soberly, over my last drop of grog, before I went into\nmy berth that night, and prayed for the sins of the day to go upward,\nwhat do you think I said on the half-deck, and with all the stars\nobserving me--\"I'm damned if I'll serve Parson Chowne any more.\" I said\nit, and I swore it.\n\nAnd when I came to think of it, in a practical manner, next morning, and\nto balance the ins and outs, and what I might come to, if thus led\nastray, by a man in holy orders (yet whose orders were all unholy, at\nany rate, such as he gave to me), and when I reflected on three\nhalf-crowns for finding me in everything, and then remembered how I had\nturned two guineas in a day, when poor Bardie came to me, and with a\nconscience as clear as a spent cuttle-fish; and never a sign of my heels\nbehind me, when squeamish customers sat down to dinner; also good\nMother Jones with sweet gossip, while my bit of flesh was grilling, and\nmy little nip of rum, and the sound of Bunny snoring, while I smoked a\npipe and praised myself; also the pleasure of doubting whether they\ncould do without me at the \"Jolly\" through the wall, and the certain\nknowledge how the whole of the room would meet me, if I could deny\nmyself enough to go among them;--these things made me lose myself, as in\nthis sentence I have done, in longing to find old times and places, and\nold faces, once again, and some one to call me \"Old Dyo.\"\n\nNow who would believe that the whole of all this was wrought in my not\nvery foolish mind, by the sight of a beautiful high-bred face, and the\nsound of a very sweet softening voice? Also the elegant manner in which\nshe never asked what the passage would come to, but gave me a bright and\ntrue half-crown for herself and that frippery French girl. I must be a\nfool; no doubt I am, when the spirit of ancestors springs within me,\nspoiling all trade; as an inborn hiccough ruins the best pipe that ever\nwas filled. For though I owed three tidy bills, I had no comfort until I\ndrilled a little hole in that bright half-crown, and hung it with my\ncharms and knobs and caul inside my Jersey. And thus the result became\npermanent, and my happiness was in my heart again, and all my\nself-respect leaped up as ready to fight as it ever had been, when I had\nshaped a firm resolve to shake off Chowne, like the devil himself.\n\nI cannot imagine a lower thing than for any man to say--and some were\neven to that degree base--that I thus resolved upon calculation, and\nability now to get on without him, and balance of his three half-crowns\nagainst the income of my ferry, with which I admit that his work\ninterfered. Neither would any but a very vile man dare to cast\nreflections upon me, for having created by skill and eloquence a small\nsnug trade in the way of fish, and of those birds which are sent by the\nLord in a casual way, and without any ownership, for the good of us\nunestated folk. While I deny as unequivocally as if upon oath before\nmagistrates, that more than fifty hares and pheasants--but there! I may\ngo on for ever rebutting those endless charges and calumnies, which the\nmere force of my innocent candour seems to strike out of maliciousness.\nOnce for all, I never poach, I never stab salmon, I never smuggle, I\nnever steal boats, I never sell fish with any stink outside of it,--and\nhow can I tell what it does inside, or what it may do afterwards? I\nnever tell lies to anybody who does not downright call for it; and you\nmay go miles and miles, I am sure, to find a more thoroughly honourable,\ngood-hearted, brave, and agreeable man.\n\nNow I did not mean to say any of this, when I began about it; neither am\nI in the habit of deigning even to clear myself; but once beginning with\nan explanation, I found it the best to start clear again; because Parson\nChowne, and my manner towards him (which for the life of me I could not\nhelp), also my service under him, and visit at his house, and so on, and\neven my liking for Parson Jack (after his sale to Satan, though managed\nwithout his privity), as well as my being had up for shooting pheasants\nwith a telescope;--these and many other things, too small now to dwell\nupon, may have spread a cloud betwixt my poor self and my readers; and a\ncloud whose belly is a gale of wind.\n\nIt is not that I ever could do any unworthy action. It is simply that I\ncan conceive the possibility of it seeming so to those who have never\nmet me; and who from my over-candid account (purposely shaped dead\nagainst myself) may be at a loss to enter into the delicacies of my\nconduct. But you shall see by-and-by; and seeing is believing.\n\nNow it was a lucky thing, that on the very morning after I had made my\nmind up so, and before it was altered much, down came Chowne in a\ntearing mood, with his beautiful black mare all in a lather. I was on\nboard of the Rose of Devon, smoking my first after-breakfast pipe, and\ncounting my cash from the ferry business of the day before--except, of\ncourse, the half-crown which lay among my charms, and strengthened me.\nThe ketch was aground in a cradle of sand, which she had long ago\nscooped for herself, and which she seldom got out of now, except just to\nfloat at the top of the springs. She stood almost on an even keel,\nunless it were blowing heavily. Our punt (or rather I should call her\nmine by this time, for of course she most justly belonged to me, after\nall their breach of contract, and desertion of their colours)--at any\nrate, there she was afloat and ready for any passenger, while my notice\nto the public flapped below the mainboom of the ketch.\n\n\"You precious rascal,\" cried Chowne, from the wharf, with his horse\nstaring at the tarpaulin, and half inclined to shy from it; \"who was it\ncrossed the river twice in your rotten ferry-boat yesterday?\"\n\n\"Please your Reverence,\" I answered, calmly puffing at my pipe, which I\nknew would still more infuriate him: \"will your Reverence give me time\nto think? Let me see--why, let me see--there was Mother Pugsley from up\nthe hill, and Mother Bidgood from round the corner, and Farmer Skinner,\nand young Joe Thorne, and Eliza Tucker from the mill, and Jenny\nStribling, and Honor Jose, first cousin to our captain, and--well I\nthink that's nearly all that I know the name of, your Reverence.\"\n\n\"I thought you knew me better now than to lie to me, Llewellyn. You know\nwhat I mean as well as I do.\"\n\n\"To be sure, to be sure, your Reverence; I beg your pardon altogether. I\nought to have remembered poor old Nanny Gotobed.\"\n\nThe wharf was high, and our gunwale below it; he put his mare at it,\nclapped in the spurs, and before I could think or even wonder, he had me\nby the nape of the neck, with his knuckles grinding into me, and his\nface, now ashy white with rage, fixed on me, so that I could not move.\n\n\"Will you tell me?\" he cried.\n\n\"I won't,\" said I; crack came his hunting-whip round my sides--crack,\nand wish, and crack again; then I caught up a broken spar, and struck\nhim senseless over the tail of his horse. The mare ramped all round the\nhalf-deck mad, then leaped ashore, with her legs all bloody, and scoured\naway with her saddle off.\n\nChowne lay so long insensible, that a cold sweat broke through the heat\nof my wrath, to think that I had killed him. And but for his hat, I had\ndone no less, for I struck with the strength of a maddened man, and the\nspar was of heavy Dantzic. I untied his neckcloth, and ran for water,\nand propped him up, and bathed his forehead, although my hands were\ntrembling so that I could scarcely hold the swab. And now as I watched\nhis pale stern face without a weak line in it even from fainting, I was\namazed at having ever dared to lift hand against him. But what Royal\nNavyman could ever put up with horsewhip?\n\nAt last he fetched a strong breath, and opened the usual wickedness of\nhis eyes, and knew me at once, but did not know exactly what had\nbefallen him. I have had a good deal to do with knocking down a good\nmany men, and know that such is their usual practice; and that if you\ntake them promptly then, they will sometimes believe things very freely.\nTherefore I said, \"Your Reverence has contrived to hit yourself very\nhard, but I hope you will soon be better again.\"\n\n\"Hit myself! Why, somebody hit me!\" and then he went off again into a\ndoze, from the buzzing of his head perhaps Perceiving that he would\nsoon come to himself, and desiring to be acquitted of any violent charge\nof battery, I jumped down into the hold and fetched an old boom that was\nlying there, and hoisted it up in the tackle-fall, so as to hang at\nabout the right height. Moreover, I put the spar well away; and then,\nwith a sluice of water, I fetched his Reverence back to himself again. I\nfound him very correct this time, and beginning to look about pretty\nbriskly, therefore I turned him away and said, \"Your Reverence must not\nlook at it--it will make your head go round again; either shut your eyes\nor look away, your Worship.\"\n\nHe seemed not to notice me, so I went on, \"Your Reverence has had a\nnarrow escape. What a mercy your head is not broken! Your Reverence went\nto chastise me, and lo! your horse reared and threw your Reverence\nagainst that great boom which that lubberly Jose has left there ever\nsince we broke cargo.\"\n\n\"You are a liar,\" he said; \"you struck me. To the last day of your life\nyou shall rue it.\"\n\nThe voice of his throat ran cold all through me, being so low and so\ncold itself; and the strength of his eyes was coming back, and the\nbitter disdain of his countenance. The devil, who wanted him for a rare\nmorsel in the way of cannibalism, stood at my elbow; but luckily thought\nit sweeter not to hurry it. The foulest man on all God's earth, who made\na scoff of mercy's self, lay at my mercy for a minute, defied it, took\nit, and hated it. For the sake of myself, I let him go. For the sake of\nmankind, I should have slain him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nUNDER FAIRER AUSPICES.\n\n\nKnowing now what I had to expect from Parson Chowne and from all his\ntrain (whether clothed or naked), and even perhaps from Parson Jack, who\nlay beneath his thumb so much, and who could thrash me properly; I\nseized the chance of a good high tide, and gave a man sixpence to help\nme, and warped the Rose of Devon to a berth where she could float and\nswing, and nobody come a-nigh her without a boat or a swimming-bout.\nBecause I knew from so many folk what a fiend I had to deal with, and\nthat his first resort for vengeance (haply through his origin) generally\nwas to fire. They told me that when he condescended to do duty in either\nchurch--for two he had, as I may have said--all the farmers took it for\na call to have their ricks burned. They durst not stay away from church,\nto save the very lives of them, nor could they leave their wives behind,\non account of the unclothed people: all they could hope was that no\noffence had come from their premises, since last service. The service he\nheld just as suited his mood; sometimes three months, and the\nchurch-door locked; sometimes three Sundays one after the other, man,\nwoman, and child demanded. Whenever this happened, the congregation knew\nthat the parish had displeased him, and that he wanted them all in\nchurch; while his boy was at the stackyards. He never deigned to preach,\nbut made the prayers themselves a comedy, singing them up to the clerk's\n\"amen,\" and the neigh of his mare from the vestry.\n\nI cannot believe even half that I hear from the very best authority;\ntherefore I set nothing down which may be overcoloured. But the\nfollowing story I know to be true, because seven people have told it to\nme, and not any two very different. Two or three bishops and archdeacons\n(or deacons of arches, I know not which, at any rate high free-masons)\ndesired to know some little more about a man in their jurisdiction\neminent to that extent, and equally notorious. They meant no harm at\nall, but just to take a little feel of him. Because he had come to\nvisitation, once or twice when summoned, with his huntsman and his\nhounds, and himself in leathern breeches. There must have been something\namiss in this, or at any rate they thought so; and his lordship, a\nbishop just appointed, made up his mind to tackle him. He came in a\ncoach-and-four, and wearing all his high canonicals, and they managed\nsomehow to get up the hill, and appear at Nympton Rectory. Then a\nfootman struck the door with a gold stick well embossed; and he struck\nagain, and he struck again, more in dudgeon every time.\n\nBecause no man had yet been seen, nor woman on the premises; only dogs\nvery wild and mad, but kept away from biting. \"Strike again,\" said his\nlordship, nodding under his wig, with some courtesy; \"we must never be\nimpatient. Jemmy, strike again, my lad.\" Jemmy struck a thundering\nstroke, and out came Mrs Steelyard. She looked at them all, and then she\nsaid, with her eyes full on the Bishop's, \"Are you robbers, or are you\nsavages? My master in that state and you do this!\" And they all saw that\nshe could not weep, by reason of too much sorrow. \"It is the Lord\nBishop,\" said the footman, keeping a little away from her. \"Excellent\nfemale,\" began his Lordship, spreading his hands in a habit learned\naccording to his duties, \"tell your master that his[C] Jehoshaphat wishes\nto see him.\" \"Mr Jehoshaphat,\" she replied, \"you are just in time, and\nno more, sir. How we have longed for a minister! You are just in time\nand no more, sir. Will you have the kindness to come this way, and to\nstep as quietly as you can?\" His Lordship liked not the look of this;\nbeing, however, a resolute man, he followed the stony woman up the\nstaircase, and into a bedroom with the window-curtains three quarters\ndrawn. And here he found a pastille burning, and a lot of medicine\nbottles, and a Bible on the table open, and on it a pair of spectacles.\nIn the bed lay some one, with a face of fire heavily blotched with bungs\nof black, and all his body tossing with spasms and weak groaning. \"What\nmeans this?\" asked his Lordship, drawing considerably nearer to the\ndoor. \"Only the[D] plague,\" said the stony woman; \"he was took with it\nyesterday; doctor says he may last two hours more almost, particular if\nhe can get anybody to take the symptoms off him. I expect to be down\nwith it some time to-night, because I feel the tingling. But your\nHighness will stop and help us.\" \"I am damned if I will,\" cried the\nBishop, sinking both manners and dignity in the violence of alarm; and\nhe ran down the stairs at such a pace that his apron strings burst, and\nhe left it behind, and he jumped into the coach with his two feet\nforemost, and slammed up the windows, and ordered full speed. Then\nParson Chowne rose, and threw off his mask, and drew back the\nwindow-curtain, and sat in his hunting-clothes, and watched with his\nusual bitter smile the rapid departure of his foe. And he had the\nBishop's apron framed, and hung it in the parsonage hall, from a\nred-deer's antlers, with the name and date below. And so of that Bishop\nhe heard no more.\n\nNow a man who had beaten three bishops, and all the archdeacons in the\ncountry, was of course tenfold of a match for me; and when he rode down\nsmoothly to me, as he did in a few days' time, and never touched on our\nlittle skirmish, except with a sort of playful hit (so far as his\nhaughty mind could play), and riding another horse without a word about\nthe mischief which his favourite mare had taken, and demanded, as a\nmatter of justice, that having quitted his service now, I should pay\nback seven-and-sixpence drawn in advance for wages, I was obliged to\ntouch my hat, as if I had never made stroke at his, or put my knee upon\nhim. He had flogged me to such purpose that I ever must admire him; for\nthe flick of the boatswain's lash was a tickle compared to what Chowne\ntook out of me; and if I must tell the whole truth, I was prouder of\nhaving knocked down such a wonderful man than of all of my victories put\ntogether. But one of my weak and unreasonable views of life is this,\nthat having thrashed a man, I feel a great power of goodwill to him, and\na desire to give him quarter, and the more so the less he cries for it.\n\nBut, on the whole, I was not so young after all that was said by\neverybody, as to imagine for a moment that I had felt the last of him.\nThe very highest in the land had been compelled to yield to him: as when\nhe turned out my Lord G----'s horses from the stabling ordered at Lord\nG----'s inn. Would such a man accept defeat from a crazy old mariner\nlike me? Feeling my danger, and meaning never to knock under any more, I\nrefused, as a matter of principle, to restore so much as a halfpenny;\nand if I understand law at all, he was bound to give me another week's\nwages, in default of notice. However, I could not get it; and therefore\nam glad to quit such trifles.\n\nFrom all experience it was known that this man never hurried vengeance.\nHe knew that he was sure to get it; and he liked to dwell upon it, thus\nprolonging his enjoyment by the means of hope. He loved, as in the case\nof that unfortunate Captain Vellacott, to persuade his enemies that he\nhad forgiven, or at least forgotten them, and then to surprise them, and\nlaugh to himself at their ignorance of his nature. So I felt pretty sure\nthat I had some time till my life would be in danger. For, of course, he\nknew that my ferry business, growing in profit daily, would keep me\nwithin his reach for the present, over and above the difficulty of\ngetting across the Channel now. However, he began upon me sooner than I\nexpected, on account, perhaps, of my low degree.\n\nBut in the meanwhile, feeling sure that I could not stand worse with him\nthan I did--desiring, moreover, to ease my conscience, and perhaps\nimprove my income, by an act of justice--I crossed the river to Narnton\nCourt, and getting among the servants nicely, sent word in to Miss\nIsabel Carey that the old ferryman begged leave to see her upon business\nmost particular. For, of course (although, in the hurry of things, I\nmay have forgotten to mention it), the lovely young lady I ferried\nacross, and whose name I was thrashed so for not betraying, was Captain\nDrake's sweetheart, the ward of Sir Philip.\n\nOne of the most hateful things in Chowne was, that he never did anything\nin the good old-fashioned manner, unless it were use of the horsewhip.\nAnd it now rejoiced my heart almost to be shown into a fine dark room,\nby the side of good long passages, with a footman going before me, and\nshowing legs of a quite superior order, and then under my instructions\nboldly throwing an oaken door wide, and announcing, \"Mr David Llewellyn,\nma'am!\"\n\nFor though I had left Felix Farley behind, from a sort of romantic\nbashfulness, I had seen in the hall a coloured gentleman, who seemed\njustly popular; therefore I had just dropped a hint (not meant to go any\nfurther) concerning my risk of life and fortitude for the sake of black\nmen. And this made the women admire me, for it turned out that this\nworthy negro stood high in the house, and had saved some cash. The room\nwhich I entered was large and high, with an amazing number of books in\nit, and smelling exceeding learned. And there in a deep window sat the\nyoung lady, with the light from the river glancing on the bright\nelegance of her hair. And when she rose and came towards me, I felt\nuncommonly proud of having been even thrashed for her sake: nor did I\nwonder at Captain Drake's warm manner of proceeding, or at Chowne's\nresolve to keep so jealous a watch over her. Over and above her beauty,\nwhich was no business of mine, of course, she had such pretty eyebrows\nand so sweet a way of looking, that a thrill went to my experienced\nheart, in spite of all experience; and women seemed a different thing\nfrom what I was accustomed to.\n\nTherefore I left her to begin; while I made bows, and felt afraid of\ngiving offence by gazing. She, however, put me at my ease almost\ndirectly, having such a high-bred way, so clarified and gentle, that I\nneither could be distant nor familiar with her. Only to be quite at\nease, like, respect, and love her. And this lady was only about\nseventeen! It is wonderful how they learn so much.\n\nI need not follow all I said, or even what she said to me. Without for a\nmoment sacrificing my true sense of dignity, I gave her to understand,\nvery mildly, that I had seen something, and had taken a vague sense of\nits import, when I chanced to be after wild-ducks. Also that strong\nattempts had been made to set me spying after her, and that I might have\nyielded to them, but for my own lofty sense of being a victorious\nveteran, and the way in which I was conquered by her extraordinary\nbeauty.\n\nShe seemed for a moment to doubt how far I should have touched that\nsubject; and if I had only looked up she would have rung the bell\ndecidedly. But I bowed, and kept down my eyelashes; which were grey now,\nand helped me much in paying innocent compliments to every kind of\nwoman. Even in the bar of very first-rate public-houses have I been\npressed to take, and not pay for, glasses even of ancient stingo,\nbecause of the way I have paid respects, and looked through my shadows\nafterwards. Therefore this young lady said, \"I hardly know what to do or\nsay. Mr Llewellyn, it is a strange tale. Why should any one watch me?\"\n\n\"That is more than I can say, my lady. I only know that the thing is\ndone, and by a very wicked man indeed.\"\n\n\"And you have found it out, as ferryman? How clever of you, to be sure!\nAnd how honest to come and tell me! You have been a royal sailor?\"\n\n\"In the Royal Navy, ma'am! Our captains are the most noble men, so\nbrave, and glorious, and handsome! If you could only see one of them!\"\n\n\"Perhaps I have,\" she said, under her breath, being carried away by my\ndescription, as I hoped to do to her; and then she came back through a\nshading of colours to herself, and looked at me, as if to say, \"Have you\ndetected me now?\" I touched my lock; and by no means seemed to have\ndreamed a suspicion of anything.\n\n\"You are a most worthy man,\" she said; \"and wonderfully straightforward.\nNone but a Royal Navy sailor could have behaved so nobly. In spite of\nall the bribes offered you----\"\n\n\"No, no, no!\" I cried; \"nothing to speak of! nothing to speak of! What\nis a guinea and a half a-week when it touches a man's integrity?\"\n\n\"Three guineas a-week you shall have at once; because you have behaved\nso nobly, and because you have fought for your country so, and been left\nwith nothing (I think you said), with half of your lungs quite shot\naway, except twopence a-day to live upon!\"\n\n\"One and eightpence farthing a-week, my lady; and to be signed by a\nclergyman; and twenty-eight miles to walk for it.\"\n\n\"It vexes mo so to hear such things. Don't tell me any more of it. What\nis the use of having money except for the people who want it? Mr\nLlewellyn, you must try not to be offended.\"\n\nI saw that there was something coming, but looked very grave about it. A\nman of my rank and mark must never be at all ready, and much less eager,\nto lay himself under any form of trifling obligation. And thoroughly as\nshe had won me over, I tried very hard not to be offended, while she was\ngoing to a small black desk. If she had come thence with a guinea or\ntwo, my mind was made up to do nothing more than gracefully wave it back\nagain, and show myself hurt at such ignorance of me. But now when she\ncame with a \u00c2\u00a35 note (such as Sir Philip seemed to keep in stock), my\nduty to Bardie and Bunny rose as upright as could be before my eyes, and\noverpowered all selfish niceties. I would not make a fuss about it, lest\nI might hurt her feelings, but placed it in my pocket with a bow of\nsilent gratitude. Perhaps my face conveyed to her that it was not the\nmoney I cared for; only to do what was just and right, as any British\nsailor must when delicately handled. Also her confidence in me was so\nthoroughly sweet and delicate, that I felt the whole of my heart wrapped\nup in saving her from her enemies. We made no arrangements about it; but\nI went into her service bodily, being left to my own discretion, as\nseemed due to my skill and experience. I was to keep the ferry going,\nbecause of the opportunities, as well as to lull suspicion, and always\nat dark I was bound to be (according to my own proposal) near the river\nfront of the house, to watch against all wicked treachery. And\nespecially if a spy of Chowne's should come sneaking and skulking there,\nwhether in a boat or out of it, I gladly volunteered to thrash him\nwithin an inch of his foul base life. The bad man's name never passed\nbetween us; and indeed I may say that the lady forbore from committing\nherself against anybody, so that I was surprised to find such wit in one\nso youthful.\n\nWe settled between us that my duties were to begin that very day, and my\nsalary of course to run, also how the lady was to let me know when\nwanted, and I to tell her when I discovered anything suspicious. And as\nI had been compelled to restore the Parson's gun to his gunmaker, Miss\nCarey led me to a place you might almost call an armoury, and bade me\nchoose any piece I liked, and her own maid should place it where I could\nfind it that same evening, as though it were to shoot wild-fowl for\nthem. But she advised me on no account to have any talk with Nanette, or\nany servants of the household, whether male or female, not only because\nof the wicked reports and cruel slanders prevailing, but also that it\nmight not be known how I was to act in her interest. And then having\nordered me a good hot dinner in the butler's pantry, as often was done\nfor poor people, she let me go once, and then called me back, and said,\n\"Oh, nothing;\" and then called me again, and said, looking steadily out\nof the window, \"By the by, I have quite forgotten to say that there is a\nboat belonging to a ship commanded by a son of Sir Philip Bampfylde, a\nwhite boat, with three oars on each side, and sometimes an officer\nbehind them. If they should happen to come up the river, or to go ashore\nupon business here, you need not--I mean, you will quite understand that\nno harm whatever is intended to me, and therefore that you may--you see\nwhat I mean.\"\n\n\"To be sure, to be sure, my lady. Of course I may quit my duty so long\nas there is a man-of-war's boat in the river; even the boldest and worst\nof men would venture nothing against you then.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" she replied, looking bravely round, with as much of pride in\nher bright blue eyes as of colour on her soft fresh cheeks. So I made my\nbest bow and departed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nTWO POOR CHILDREN.\n\n\nBy this time I owe it to all the kind people who have felt some pity for\nour Bardie and her fortunes, to put off no longer a few little things\nwhich I ought to tell them. In the first place, they must not think of\nme, but look upon me as nobody (treat me, in fact, as I treat myself),\nand never ask what I knew just now, and what I came to know afterwards.\nOnly to trust me (as now they must) to act in all things honourably, and\nwith no regard to self; and not only that, but with lofty feeling, and a\nsense of devotion towards the members of the weaker sex.\n\nCaptain Drake Bampfylde was the most unlucky of born mortals. To begin\nwith, he was the younger son of that very fine Sir Philip, and feeling\nthat he had far more wit and enterprise than his elder brother, while\nthankful to nature for these endowments, he needs must feel amiss with\nher for having mismanaged his time of birth. Now please to observe my\nform of words. I never said that he did so feel, I only say that he must\nhave done so, unless she had made him beyond herself; which, from her\nlove for us, she hardly ever tries to do. However, he might have put up\nwith that mistake of the goddess that sits cross-legged,--I have heard\nof her, I can tell you, and a ship named after her; though to spell her\nname would be a travail to me, fatal perhaps at my time of life,--I mean\nto say, at any rate, that young Drake Bampfylde might have managed to\nget over the things against him, and to be a happy fellow, if he only\nhad common luck. But Providence having gifted him with unusual\nadvantages of body, and mind, and so forth, seemed to think its duty\ndone, and to leave him to the devil afterwards.\n\nThis is a bad way of beginning life, especially at too young an age to\nbe up to its philosophy; and the only thing that can save such a man is\na tremendous illness, or the downright love of a first-rate woman.\nThence they recover confidence, or are brought into humility, and get a\nbit of faith again, as well as being looked after purely, and finding a\nvalue again to fight for, after abandoning their own. Not that Drake\nBampfylde ever did slip into evil courses, so far as I could hear of\nhim, or even give way to the sense of luck, and abandon that of duty. I\nam only saying how things turn out, with nineteen men out of twenty. In\nspite of chances, he may have happened just to be the twentieth. I know\nfor sure that he turned up well, though vexed with tribulation. Evil\ntimes began upon him, when he was nothing but a boy. He fell into a pit\nof trouble through his education; and ever since from time to time new\ngrief had overtaken him. A merrier little chap, or one more glad to make\nthe best of things, could not be found; as was said to me by the cook,\nand also the parlour-maid. He would do things, when he came out among\nthe servants, beautifully; and the maids used to kiss him so that his\nbreath was taken away with pleasing them. And then he went to school,\nand all the maids, and boys, and men almost, came out to see the yellow\ncoach, and throw an old shoe after him. This, however, did not help him,\nas was seriously hoped; and why? Because it went heel-foremost, from the\nstupidity of the caster. News came, in a little time, that there was\nmischief upward, and that Master Drake must be fetched home, to give\nany kind of content again. For he was at an ancient grammar-school in a\ntown seven miles from Exeter, where everything was done truly well to\nkeep the boys from fighting. Only the habit and tradition was that if\nthey must fight, fight they should until one fell down, and could not\ncome to the scratch again. And Drake had a boy of equal spirit with his\nown to contend against, not however of bone and muscle to support him\nthoroughly. But who could grieve, or feel it half so much as young Drake\nBampfylde did, when the other boy, in three days' time, died from a\nbuzzing upon his brain? He might have got into mischief now, even though\nhe was of far higher family than the boy who had foundered instead of\nstriking; but chiefly for the goodwill of the school, and by reason of\nthe boy's father having plenty of children still to feed, and consenting\nto accept aid therein, that little matter came to be settled among them\nvery pleasantly. Only the course of young Drake's life was changed\nthereby, as follows.\n\nThe plan of his family had been to let him get plenty of learning at\nschool, and then go to Oxford Colleges and lay in more, if agreeable;\nand so grow into holy orders of the Church of England, well worth the\nwhile of any man who has a good connection. But now it was seen, without\nthinking twice, that all the disturbers and blasphemers of the\nNonconformist tribe, now arising everywhere (as in dirty Hezekiah, and\nthat greasy Hepzibah, who dared to dream such wickedness concerning even\nme), every one of these rogues was sure to cast it up against a parson,\nin his most heavenly stroke of preaching, that he must hold his hand,\nfor fear of killing the clerk beneath him. And so poor Drake was sent to\nsea; the place for all the scape-goats.\n\nHere ill fortune dogged him still, as its manner always is, after\ngetting taste of us. He heeded his business so closely that he tumbled\ninto the sea itself; and one of those brindle-bellied sharks took a\nmouthful out of him. Nevertheless he got over that, and fell into worse\ntrouble. To wit, in a very noble fight between his Britannic Majesty's\nsloop of war \"Hellgoblins,\" carrying twelve guns and two carronades\n(which came after my young time), and the French corvette \"Heloise,\" of\nsix-and twenty heavy guns, he put himself so forward that they trained\nevery gun upon him. Of course those fellows can never shoot anything\nunder the height of the moon, because they never stop to think;\nnevertheless he contrived to take considerable disadvantage. By a\nrandom shot they carried off the whole of one side of his whiskers; and\nthe hearing of the other ear fell off, though not involved in it. The\ndoctors could not make it out: however, I could thoroughly, from long\nacquaintance with cannon-balls. Also he had marks of powder under his\nskin, that would never come out, being of a coarse-grained sort, and\nsomething like the bits of tea that float in rich folks' tea-cups.\nHappening, as he did by nature, to be a fine, florid, and handsome man,\nthis powder vexed him dreadfully. Nevertheless the ladies said, loving\npowder of their own, that it made him look so much nicer.\n\nThat, however, was quite a trifle, when compared to his next misfortune.\nBeing gazetted to a ship, and the whole crew proud to sail under him, he\nleft the Downs with the wind abaft, and all hands in high spirits. There\nwas nothing those lads could not have done; and in less than twelve\nhours they could do nothing. A terrible gale from south-west arose; in\nspite of utmost seamanship they were caught in the callipers of the\nVarne, and not a score left to tell of it.\n\nThese were things to try a man, and prove the stuff inside him. However,\nhe came out gallantly. For being set afloat again, after swimming all\nnight and half a day, he brought into the Portland Roads a Crappo ship\nof twice his tonnage, and three times his gunnage; and now his sailors\nwere delighted, having hope of prize-money. That they never got, of\ncourse (which, no doubt, was all the better for their constitutions),\nbut their knowledge of battle led them to embark again with him, having\nsense (as we always have) of luck, and a crooked love of a man whose bad\nluck seems to have taken the turn. And yet their judgment was quite\namiss, and any turn taken was all for the worse. Captain Bampfylde did a\nthing, which even I, in my hotter days, would rather have avoided. He\nran a thirty-two gun frigate under the chains of a sixty-four. He\nthought that they must shoot over him, while he laid his muzzles to her\nwater-line, and then carried her by boarding.\n\nNothing could have been finer than this idea of doing it, and with eight\nFrench ships out of nine, almost, he must have succeeded. But once more\nhis luck came over, like a cloud, and darkened him. The Frenchmen had\nnot only courage (which they have too much of), but also what is not\ntheir gift, with lucky people against them, self-command and steadiness.\nThey closed their lower ports, and waited for the Englishmen to come\nup. They knew that the side of their ship fell in, like the thatch of a\nrick, from the lower ports, ten feet above the enemy. They had their\nnettings ready, and a lively sea was running.\n\nIt grieves as well as misbecomes me to describe the rest of it. The\nEnglishmen swore with all their hearts at their ladders, the sea, and\neverything, and their captain was cast down between the two ships, and\ncompelled to dive tremendously; in a word it came to this, that our\npeople either were totally shot and drowned, or spent the next Sunday in\nprison at Brest.\n\nNow here was a thing for a British captain, such as the possibility of\nit never could be dreamed of. To have lost one ship upon a French shoal,\nand the other to a Frenchman! Drake Bampfylde, but for inborn courage,\nmust have hanged himself outright. And, as it was, he could not keep\nfrom unaccustomed melancholy. And, when he came home upon exchange, it\nwas no less than his duty to abandon pleasure now, and cheerfulness, and\ncomfort; only to consider how he might redeem his honour.\n\nIn the thick of this great trouble came another three times worse. I\nknow not how I could have borne it, if it had been my case, stoutly as I\nfight against the public's rash opinions. For this Captain was believed,\nand with a deal of evidence, to have committed slaughter upon his\nbrother's children, and even to have buried them. He found it out of his\npower to prove that really he had not done it, nor had even entertained\na wish that it might happen so. Everybody thought how much their dying\nmust avail him; and though all had a good idea of his being upright,\nmost of them felt that this was nothing, in such strong temptation. I\nhave spoken of this before, and may be obliged again to speak of it;\nonly I have rebutted always, and ever shall rebut, low ideas. Yet if\ntruly he did kill them, was he to be blamed or praised, for giving them\ngood burial? The testimony upon this point was no more than that of an\nunclad man, which must of course have been worthless; until they put him\ninto a sack, and in that form received it. This fellow said that he was\ncoming home towards his family, very late one Friday night; and he knew\nthat it was Friday night because of the songs along the road of the folk\nfrom Barnstaple market. He kept himself out of their way, because they\nhad such a heap of clothes on; and being established upon the sands, for\nthe purpose of washing his wife and children, who never had seen water\nbefore, and had therefore become visited, he made a short cut across the\nsands to the hole they had all helped to scoop out, in a stiff place\nwhere some roots grew. This was his home; and not a bad one for a\nsea-side visit. At any rate he seemed to have been as happy there as any\nman with a family can experience; especially when all the members need\ncontinual friction.\n\nThis fine fellow was considering how he could get on at all with that\nnecessary practice, if the magistrates should order all his frame to be\ncovered up; and fearing much to lose all chance of any natural\naction--because there was a crusade threatened--he lay down in the\nmoonlight, and had a thoroughly fine roll in the sand. Before he had\nworn out this delight, and while he stopped to enjoy it more, he heard a\nsound, not far away, of somebody digging rapidly. Or at any rate, if it\nwas not digging, it was something like it. The weather was wonderfully\nhot, so that the rushes scarcely felt even cool to his breast and legs.\nIn that utterly lonely place (for now the road was a mile behind him,\nand the sands without a track, and the stars almost at midnight), there\ncame upon him sudden fright, impossible to reason with. He had nothing\nto be robbed off, neither had he enemy; as for soul, he never yet had\nheard of any such ownership. But an unknown latitude of terror\noverpowered him. Nothing leads a man like fear; and this poor savage,\nthough so naked, was a man of some sort.\n\nTherefore, although he would far liefer have skulked off in the\ncrannying shadows, leaving the moon to see to it, he could by no means\nfind the power to withdraw himself like that. The sound came through the\nrushes, and between the moonlit hillocks so, that he was bound to follow\nit. Crouching through the darker seams, and setting down his toe-balls\nfirst, as naked feet alone can do, step by step he drew more near,\nthough longing to be further off. And still he heard the heel-struck\nspade, and then a cast, and then the sullen sound of sand a-sliding.\nThen he came to a hollow place, and feared to turn the corner.\n\nBeing by this time frightened more than any words can set before us,\nback he stroked his shaggy hair, and in a hat of rushes laid his poor\nwild face for gazing. And in the depth of the hollow where the moonlight\nscarcely marked itself, and there seemed a softer herbage than of dry\njunk-rushes, but the banks combed over so as to bury the whole three\nfathoms deep at their very first subsiding--a man was digging a small\ndeep grave.\n\nOn the slope of the bank, and so as to do no mischief any longer, two\nlittle bodies lay put back; not flung anyhow; but laid, as if respect\nwas shown to them. Each had a clean white night-gown on, and lay in\ndecorous attitude, only side by side, and ready to go into the grave\ntogether. The man who was digging looked up at them, and sighed at so\nmuch necessity; and then fell to again, and seemed desirous to have done\nwith it.\n\nSo was the naked man who watched him, fright by this time over-creeping\neven his very eyeballs. He blessed himself for his harmlessness, and\nill-will to discipline, all the way home to his own sandhill; and a\nhundredfold when he came to know (after the dregs of fright had cleared)\nthat he had seen laid by for coolness, by this awful gravedigger, the\ncocked-hat of a British Captain in the Royal Navy. This hat he had seen\nonce before, and wondered much at the use of it, and obtained an\nexplanation which he could not help remembering. And fitting this to his\nown ideas, he was as sure as sure could be, that Captain Bampfylde was\nthe man who was burying the children.\n\nNow when this story reached the ears of poor old Sir Philip, whether\nbefore or after his visit to our country matters not, it may be supposed\nwhat his feelings were of sorrow and indignation. He sent for this\nsavage, who seemed beyond the rest of his tribe in intelligence, as\nindeed was plainly shown by his coming to bathe his family, and in spite\nof all the difference of rank and manner between them, questions\nmanifold he put, but never shook his story. And then he sent to Exeter\nfor a lawyer, thoroughly famous for turning any man inside out and\nputting what he pleased inside him. But even he was altogether puzzled\nby this man in the sack, wherein he now lived for decorum's sake,\nhowever raw it made him. And the honest fellow said that clothing\ntempted him so to forsake the truth, when he could not tell his own legs\nin it, that it sapped all principle.\n\nThat question is not for me to deal with, nor even a very much wiser\nman, except that my glimpses of foreign tribes have all been in favour\nof nudity. And the opposite practice is evidently against all the bent\nof our civilised women, who are perpetually rebelling, and more and more\neager to open their hearts to their natural manifestation. For the heart\nof a woman is not like a man's, \"desperately wicked;\" and how can they\nprove this unless they show its usual style of working? Only the other\nday I saw----but back I must go to the heart of my tale. In a word,\nthis fine male savage convinced every one he came into contact with\n(which after his bathing was permitted, if the other man bathed\nafterwards), that truly, surely, and with no mistake he must have seen\nsomething. What it was became naturally quite another question; and upon\nthis head no two people could be found of one opinion. But though it\nproved an important point, I will not dwell too long on it.\n\nCaptain Drake's boat, to my firm belief, never came once up the river\nnow; and I thought that my beautiful young lady seemed a little grieved\nat this. Every now and then she crossed, on her way to see old women,\nand even that old Mother Bang; and the French maid became a plague to\nme. She had laid herself out to obtain me, because of the softness with\nwhich I carried her; and her opposition to my quid naturally set her\nheart all the more upon me. I will not be false enough to say that I did\nnot think of her sometimes, because she really did go on in a\ntantalising manner. And we seemed to have between us something, when her\nlady's back was turned. However, she ought to have known that I never\nmean anything by this; and if she chose to lie back like that, and put\nher red lips toppermost, the least thing she should have done was first\nto be up to our manners and customs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\nA FINE OLD GENTLEMAN.\n\n\nWhen I came to look round upon this state of things, and consider it, I\nmade up my mind to tempt Providence, or rather perhaps the most opposite\nPower, by holding on where I was, in spite of the Parson and all his\ndevices. This was a stupid resolve, and one on which he had fully\ncalculated. I was getting a little perhaps fond of Nanette, though not\nquite so much as she fancied; feeling unable to pin my faith to a thing\nshe had whispered into my ear; to wit, that she would thrice soon\ninherit one three grand money, hunder tousand, more than one great\nstrong man could leeft. I asked her to let me come and try; and she said\nit was possible to be. Having a thorough acquaintance with Crappos, and\nthe small wretched particles of their money, I did not attach much\nimportance to this; for I like our King's face, and they have not got\nit; and they seem to stamp their stuff anyhow. But in spite of all\nprejudice, it would be well to look a little into it; particularly as\nthis girl (whether right or wrong in thousands) had a figure not to be\ndenied, when you came home to her.\n\nNevertheless I am not the man to part with myself at random; and there\nwas a good farmer's daughter now, solid, and two-and-thirty--which is my\nfavourite ship to sail in, handy, strong, and with guns well up--this\nyoung woman crossed the ferry, at eightpence a-day, for my sake; and I\nthought of retaining a lawyer to find what might be her prospects. She\nwas by no means bad to look at, when you got accustomed; and her nature\nvery kind, and likely to see to Bunny's clothes; also she never\ncontradicted; which is cotton-wool to one who ever has rheumatics. But I\ndid not wish to pay six-and-eightpence, and then be compelled to lose\neightpence a-day, in order to steer clear of her. So I ferried both her\nand Nanette alike, and let them encounter one another, and charged no\ndifference in their weight.\n\nNothing better fits a man, for dealing with the womankind, than to be\nwell up in fish. Now I found the benefit of that knowledge where I never\nlooked for it; and I knew the stale from the fresh--though these come\nalike in the pickle of matrimony--also (which is far more to the point)\nthe soft roes from the hard roes. These you cannot change; but must\npersuade yourself to like whichever you happen to get of them. And that\nyou find out afterwards.\n\nWhile I was dwelling upon these trifles, and getting on well with my\nserious trade, working my ferry, and catching salmon so as to amaze the\nneighbourhood, also receiving my well-earned salary from the fair\nMistress Isabel, and surprising the public-houses every night with my\nnarratives--in a word, becoming the polar-star of both sides of the\nriver--a thing befell me which was quite beyond all sense of reason.\n\nThrough wholesome fear of Parson Chowne, and knowledge of his\nfire-tricks, I kept the Rose of Devon in a berth of deep fresh water;\nwhere a bulk of sand backed up, and left a large calm pool of river.\nHere the dimpling water scarcely had the life to flow along--when the\ntide was well away; and scarcely brought a single bubble big enough to\nbreak upon us. According to the weather, so the colour of the water was.\nOnly when you understood, it seemed to please you always.\n\nOne night I was not asleep, but getting very near it; setting in my mind\nafloat (as I felt the young tide flowing) thoughts or dreams, or lighter\nvisions than the lightest dream that flits, of, about, concerning,\ntouching, anyhow regarding, or, in any lightest side-light, gleaming,\nwho can tell, or glancing from the chequers of the day-work. Suddenly a\ngreat explosion blew me out of my berth, and filled the whole of the\ncuddy with blaze and smoke. I lay on the floor half-stunned, and with\nonly sense enough for wondering. Then Providence enabled me, on the\nstrength of the battles I had been through, to get on my elbow, and look\naround. Everything seemed quite odd and stupid for a little while to me.\nI neither knew where I was, nor what had happened or would happen me.\n\nIt may have been half an hour, or it may have been only half a minute,\nbefore I was all alive again, and able to see to the mischief. Then I\nfound that a very rude thing had been done, and a most unclerical\naction, not to be lightly excused, and wholly Undeserved on my part. A\ngood-sized kettle of gunpowder had been cast into my cuddy, possibly as\na warning to me; but, to say the least, a dangerous one. My wrath\novercame all fear so much, that in spite of the risk of meeting others,\nI rushed through the smoke and up the ladder, and seized my gun from its\nsling on the deck, and gazed (or rather I should say stared) in every\ndirection around me. But whether from the darkness of the night, or the\nstinging and stunning turmoil in my eyes and upon my brain, I could not\ndescry any moving shape, or any living creature. And this even added to\nmy alarm, so that I got very little more sleep that night, I do assure\nyou.\n\nHowever, I kept my own counsel about it, even from my lady patroness,\nresolving to maintain a sharp look-out, and act as behoved a gallant\nCymro, thrown amongst a host of savages. To this intent, I took our\ntiller, which was just about six feet long, and entirely useless now,\nand I put a bit of a bottom to it, so as to stand quite decently, and\nfixed a cross-tressel for shoulders, and then dressed it up so with my\nold fishing-suit and a castaway hat to encourage my brains, that really,\nthough the thing was so grave, I could not help laughing at myself; in\nthe dusk it was so like me. When the labours of the day were over, and\nthe gleam of the water deadened, I set up this other fine Davy\nLlewellyn on board the ketch, now here now there, sometimes leaning over\nthe bulwarks in contemplation of the river (which was my favourite\nattitude, from my natural turn for reflection), sometimes idly at work\nwith a rope, or anything or nothing, only so as to be seen from shore,\nand expose to the public his whereabouts. Meanwhile I crouched in a\nditch hard by, and with both barrels loaded.\n\nYou will say this was an unchristian thing, especially as I suspected\nstrongly that my besiegers wore naked backs, and would therefore receive\nmy discharge in full. I will not argue that point, but tell you (in\ncommon fairness to myself, and to prevent any slur of the warm\naffection, long subsisting between all who have cared to listen to me\nand my free self) that whenever I hoped for a chance at those fellows, I\ndrew the duck-shot from the first barrel, and put a light charge of\nsnipe-shot in, which no man could object to. The second barrel was\nready, in case that the worst should come to the worst, as we say.\n\nNow it is a proof of my bad luck, and perhaps of my having done a thing\nbelow the high Welsh nature, that Providence never vouchsafed me a\nsingle shot at any one of them. The more trouble I took, the less they\ncame; until I could scarcely crook my fingers through the rheumatics\nthey brought on me. Night after night, I said to myself, \"If it only\npleases the Lord to save me from the wiles of this anointed one, I vow\nto go back to my duty, and teach those other young chits of boys their\nwork.\" For I had observed (though I would not tell it, except in a\nrheumatic twinge) that even Captain Bampfylde's men had lost the style\nof drawing oars through the water properly, and as I used to give the\ntune, five-and-twenty years agone.\n\nIt is needless to say, that after all the close actions I have conquered\nin, a canister of gunpowder was nothing to disturb me. But as they might\ndo worse next time, whether in joke or earnest, I made me a hutch of\nstout strong oak, also cut the bulkhead out, and freed myself into the\nhold at once, upon any unjust disturbance. Nigh me was my double gun,\nheavily shotted at bedtime, and the spar which had knocked down Parson\nChowne, and might have to do it again perhaps. And now I began to\npersuade myself into happy sleep again; for my nature is not vindictive.\n\nOne night I lay broad awake, perhaps from having shot a curlew, and\neaten him, without an onion sewn inside while roasting, but he had been\nso hard to shoot that I was full of zeal to dine upon him, and had no\nonion handy. Whether it were so or not, I lay awake and thought about\nthe strange things now come over me. To be earning money at a very noble\nrate indeed; to be winning the attentions of it may be ten young women\n(each of whom believed that never had I been in love before); and to be\nestablishing a business which could scarcely fail of growing to a\npublic-house with benches and glass windows looking down upon the river;\nand yet with all this prospect brewing, scarcely to have a moment's\npeace! What a lucky thing for Parson Chowne that I have no cold black\nblood in me! In this medley of vague thoughts (such as all men of large\nbrain have, and even myself when the moon ordains it) a strong and good\nidea struck me, and one to be dwelled upon to-morrow; and if then\napproved, to be carried out immediately. This was no less than to beg an\naudience of Sir Philip Bampfylde himself, and tell him all that I ever\nhad seen of Chowne and his devices, and place Sir Philip on his guard,\nand learn maybe a little of the many things that puzzled me. Of course I\nhad thought of this before; but for several reasons had forborne to\ncarry it any further. In the first place, it seemed such a coarse rude\nway of meeting plans that should be met with equal stealth and subtlety,\nunless a man were prepared to own himself vanquished in intelligence.\nAgain, it would have been very difficult to obtain a private interview\nwithout some stir concerning it. Moreover, I felt a delicacy with\nrespect to my stewardship on behalf of those two children; for a\nstranger might not at a glance perceive that prudence and self-denial on\nmy part, which the worrisome frivolousness of the fish had, for the\ntime, frustrated. However, I now perceived that a gentleman of Sir\nPhilip's lofty bearing could not with any grace or dignity allude to his\nown beneficence; and as for the second difficulty, I might hope for Miss\nCarey's good offices, while I could no longer think to encounter Chowne\nwith his own weapons, since he had blown me out of bed.\n\nAccordingly I persuaded my beautiful young lady, who had plenty of sense\nbut not much craft, and was pleased with my straightforwardness, to lead\nme into Sir Philip's presence in a lonely part of the grounds near the\nriver, to the westward, and out of sight of the house; in a word, not\nfar from the Braunton Burrows.\n\nHere the river made a bend and came to the breast of an ancient\norchard, rich with grass and thick with trees leafless now, but thickly\nbearded upon every twig with moss. This was of every form and fashion,\nand of almost every hue. I had never seen such a freaksome piece of work\noutside the tropics, although in Devonshire common enough, where the\nsoil is moist and the climate damp. Some of these trees lay down on the\nground, as if they wore tired of standing, and some were in sitting\npostures, and some half leaning over; but all alive, in spite of that,\nand fruitful when it suited them. And everything being neglected now,\nfrom want of the Squire's attention, heaps of rosy and golden apples lay\nwhere they had been piled to sweat, but never led to the cider-press.\n\nPerceiving no sign of Sir Philip about, and remembering how it was now\nbeginning to draw on for Christmas-time, I felt myself welcome to one or\ntwo of these neglected apples; for it was much if nobody of the farmers'\nwives who crossed the ferry could afford me a goose for Christmas in my\nsolitary hole. And even if all should fail disgracefully of their duty\ntowards me, I had my eye on a nice young bird of more than the average\nplumpness, who neglected his parents' advice every day, and came for\nsome favourite grass of his, which only grew just on the river's verge,\nwithin thirty yards of my fusil. It would have shown low curiosity to\nask if he owned an owner. From his independent manner I felt that he\nmust be public property; and I meant to reduce him into possession right\nearly in the morning of the Saint that was so incredulous. It is every\nman's duty to treat himself well at the time of the Holy Nativity; and\nhaving a knowledge of Devonshire geese, after two months on the\nstubbles, I could not do better than store in my boat one or two of\nthese derelict apples.\n\nNever do I see or taste an apple without thinking of poor Bardie.\n\"Appledies,\" she always called them, and she was so fond of them, and\nher little white teeth made marks like a small-tooth comb in the flesh\nof them. I was thinking of her, and had scarcely embarked more than a\nbushel or so, for sauce, in a little snug locker of my own, when I had\nthe pleasure of seeing the gentleman whom I had come all that way to\nsee.\n\nAt my own desire, and through Miss Carey's faith in me, it had not been\nlaid before Sir Philip that I was likely to meet him here; only she had\ntold me when and where to come across him, so as not to be broken in\nupon. Now he came down the narrow winding walk, at the lower side of the\norchard, a path overhanging a little brook which murmured under last\nsummer's growth; and I gazed at him silently for a while, through the\nbushes that overhung my boat. He was dressed as when I had seen him last\nthrough my telescope, at the time we came up the river; that is to say,\nin black velvet, and with his long sword hanging beside him. A brave,\nand stately, and noble man, walking through a steady gloom of grief, and\nyet content to walk alone, and never speak of it.\n\nI leaped through the bush at the river's brink, and suddenly stood\nbefore him. He set his calm cold gaze upon me, without a shadow of\nsurprise, as if to say, \"You have no business in my private grounds;\nhowever, it is not worth speaking of.\" I made him a low bow with my hat\noff; and he moved his own, and was passing on.\n\n\"Will your Worship look at me,\" I said, \"and see whether you remember\nme?\" He seemed just a little surprised, and then with his inborn\ncourtesy complied.\n\n\"I have seen you before, but I know not where. Sir, I often need pardon\nnow for the weakness of my memory.\"\n\nIn a few short words I brought to his mind that evening visit to my\ncottage, with Anthony Stew and the yellow carriage.\n\n\"To be sure, to be sure! I remember now,\" he said, with his grave and\nplacid smile: \"David Llewellyn! Both good old names, and the latter, I\ndaresay, in your belief, both the older and the better one. I remember\nyour hospitality, your patience, and your love of children. Is there\nanything I can do for you?\"\n\n\"No, your Worship, nothing. I am here for your sake only; although if I\nwanted, I would ask you, having found you so good and kind.\"\n\n\"Whence did you get that expression, my friend? The common usage is\n'kind and good;' I once knew a very little child--but I suppose it is\nthe Welsh idiom.\"\n\n\"Your Worship, I can speak English thoroughly; better even than my own\nlanguage; and all around us the scholarly people have more English than\nof Welsh. But to let your Worship know my cause to come so much upon\nyou, is of things more to the purpose. I have found a bad man meaning\nmischief to your Worship.\"\n\n\"It cannot be so,\" he replied, withdrawing, as if I were taking a\nliberty; \"no doubt but you mean me well, Llewellyn, and yourself believe\nit. But neither I, nor any one else of all my family, now so small, can\nhave given reason for any ill-will towards us.\"\n\nIt was not for me to dare to speak, while the General was reflecting\nthus, as if in his own mind going through every small accident of his\nlife; even the servants he might have discharged; or the land-forces\nordered for punishment, whereof to my mind they lack more than they get,\nand grow their backs up in a manner beyond all perception of discipline.\n\nFor my part, I could not help thinking, as I watched him carefully, how\nlow and black must be the nature of the heart that could rejoice in such\na man's unhappiness. A man who, at threescore years and five, was\ncompelled to rack his memory (even after being long in uncontrolled\nauthority) to find a time when he might have given cause for private\nenmity! If I had only enjoyed such chances, I must have had at least a\nscore of strong enemies by this time. Being a little surprised, I looked\nagain and again at his white eyebrows, while his eyes were on the\nground; also at his lips and nostrils, which were highly dignified. And\nI saw, in my dry low way, one reason why he had never given offence. He\nwas perhaps a little scant of humour and of quickness; which two things\ngive more offence to the outer world that has them not, than the longest\ncourse of rigid business carried on without them. I have seen a man who\ncould not crack nuts fly into a fury with one who could. And these\nreflections made me even yet more anxious to serve him, so grave, and\ncalm, and simple-minded, and so patient was his face.\n\nNevertheless I did not desire, and would at the point of his sword have\nrefused, a halfpenny, for the things of import which I now disclosed to\nhim. He led me to an ancient bench, beneath a well-worn apple-tree; and\nsat thereon, and even signed for me to sit beside him. My knowledge of\nhis rank would not permit me to do this; until I was compelled to argue.\nA gentleman more shaped and set inside his own opinions, it had never\nbeen my luck to have to deal with, now and then. There are men you\ncannot laugh at, though you get the best of them, unless your conscience\nworks with such integrity as theirs does. And the sense of this, in some\nway unknown, may have now been over me. How I began it, or even showed\nmy sense of manners, and of all the different rank between us, is beyond\nmy knowledge now; and must have flowed from instinct then. Enough that I\ndid lead Sir Philip to have thoughts, and to hearken me.\n\nWith a power not expected by myself at first beginning, while in doubt\nof throat and words, I contrived to set before him much that had\nbefallen me. Though I never said a word that lay outside my knowledge,\nneither let a spark of heat find entrance to my mind at all, and would\nrather speak too little than be thought outrageous, there could be no\ndoubt that my simple way of putting all I had to say, moved this lofty\nman, as if he were one of the children at the well belonging to John the\nBaptist. I thought of all those pretty dears (as I beheld him\nlistening), and the way they sat around me, and their style of moving\ntoes at any great catastrophe; whiles they kept their hands and noses\nunder very stiff control; also the universal sigh, when my story killed\nany one by any means unfit to die; and their pure contempt of the things\nthey suck, the whole while they are swallowing. Sir Philip (to whom my\nthoughts meant no failure of respect, but feeling of simplicity), this\nold gentleman let me speak as one well accustomed to lengthiness. But I\ndid my best to keep a small helm, and yards on the creak for bracing.\n\n\"If I take you aright,\" he said, as I drew near the end of my story,\n\"you have not a high opinion of that reverend gentleman, Stoyle Chowne.\"\n\n\"I look upon him, your Worship, as the blackest-hearted son of Belial\never sent into this world.\"\n\nSir Philip frowned, as behoved a man accustomed to authority, and only\nto have little words, half spoken out, before him. But at my time of\nlife, no officer under an admiral on full pay, could have any right to\ndamp my power of expression. However, my respect was such for the\npresence of this noble man, that I rose and made a leg to him.\n\n\"I am sorry to say,\" he answered, bowing to my bow, as all gentlemen\nmust do; \"that this is not the first time I have heard unpleasant things\nabout poor Stoyle. He is my godson, and has been almost as one of my own\nchildren. I never can believe that he would ever do me injury. If I\nthought it, I should have to think amiss of almost every one.\"\n\nHe turned away, as if already he had said more than he meaned; and\nfeeling how he treated me, as if of his own rank almost, I did not\nwonder at the tales of men who gave their lives to save him, in the\nbloody battle-time. Knowing the world as I do, I only sighed, and waited\nfor him.\n\n\"You are very good,\" he said, without a tone of patronage, \"to have\nthought to help me by delivering your opinions. A heavy trouble has\nfallen upon us, and the goodwill of the neighbourhood has many times\nastonished me. However, you must indulge no more in any such wild ideas.\nThey all proceed from the evil one, and are his choicest device to lower\nthe value of holy orders. The Reverend Stoyle Chowne descends from a\nvery good old family, at any rate on his father's side; and he has his\ndignity to maintain, and his holy office to support him. On this head, I\nwill hear no more.\"\n\nThe General shut his mouth and closed it, so that I could never dare to\nopen mine again to him, concerning this one subject. And his manner\nstopped me so that I only made my duty. This he acknowledged in a manner\nwhich became both him and me; and then he passed through a little gate\nto his usual walk upon Braunton Burrows.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\nNOTICE TO QUIT.\n\n\nWe were now come to the time of year which all good Christians celebrate\nby goodwill and festivities. Even I, in my humble way, had made some\npreparation for this holy period by shooting Farmer Badcock's goose;\nwhich had long been in my mind. Upon plucking, he turned out even whiter\nand better than expectation, and the tender down clung to him, in a way\nthat showed his texture. I hung him up in a fine through-draught, and\nrejoiced in the thought of him every time my head came in between his\nlegs. Neither did he fall away when he came to roasting.\n\nBut when I had put him down, upon the Christmas morning, with intent to\nstick thereby, and baste him up to one o'clock, dipping bits of bread\nbeneath him, as he might begin to drip, and winning thus foretaste of\nhim--all my plans were overset by a merry party coming, and demanding\n\"ferry.\" With my lovely goose beginning just to spread his skin a\nlittle, and hiss sweetly at the fire, up I ran, with resolution not to\nferry anybody, but to cook my goose aright.\n\nNevertheless it might not be so. Here were three young fellows ramping\nof the high nobility, swearing to come aboard and stick me, if I would\nnot ferry them. It was not that I feared of this, but that I beheld a\nguinea spinning in the morning sun, which compelled me to forego, and\nleave my poor young goose to roll around, and try to roast himself.\nTherefore I backed him from the fire, and laid half a pound of slow lard\non his breast, and trusted his honour to keep alive.\n\nThese young joyous fellows now were awake to everything. They had begun\nthe morning bravely with a cup of rum and lemon, then a tender grill of\nbeef, and a quart of creamy ale, every one accordingly. And they meant\nto keep the day up to no less a pattern, being all of fine old birth,\nand bound to act accordingly. However, it had been said by some one,\nthat they ought to go to church; and they happened to feel the strength\nof this, and vowed that the devil should catch the hindmost, unless they\nstruck out for it.\n\nHence I came to win the pleasure of their company, that day. Their\nnearest church was the little, simple, quiet old church at Ashford. From\nmy ferry I could see it; and it often made me sigh, because it looked so\ntranquil. Sweet green land sloped up towards it, with a trace of crooked\nfootpaths, and the nicks of elbowed hedges, where the cows came down and\nstood. Also from it, looking downward through the valley of the Tawe,\nmay be seen a spread of beauty, and of soft variety, and of largeness\nopening larger with the many winding waters, to the ocean unbeheld, that\nthe sternest man must sigh, and look again and look again.\n\nA genuine parson now was master of this queer old quiet church; a man\nwho gave his life entire for the good of other men. In a little hut he\nlived, which the clerk's house overrode, just at the turning of the\nlane, upon the steep ascent, and where the thunder-showers flooded it.\nAll the poor folk soon began to dwell upon his noble nature, and to feel\nthat here was some one fit to talk of Saviours. Miles around they came\nto hear him, so that he was forced to stand on a stool in the porch, and\nspeak to them. For speaking it was, and not preaching; which made all\nthe difference.\n\nThese three gay young sparks leaped lightly into the bow of my\nferry-boat, and bade me pull for my very life, unless I desired to be\nflung into the water then and there. A strong spring-tide was running\nup, and I was forced to pull the starboard oar with all my might to keep\nthe course. My passengers were carrying on with every sort of quip and\ncrank, and jokes, that made the boat to tilt, when suddenly a rush of\nwater flooded their silk stockings. I thought at first that the bung\nwas out, and told them not to be frightened; but in another breath I saw\nthat it was a great deal worse than that. The water was rushing in\nthrough a mighty hole in the planks of the larboard bow; and in three\nminutes we must be swamped. \"All aft, all aft in a moment!\" I cried; \"it\nis our only chance of reaching shore.\" The gallants were sobered at once\nby fright, and I bundled them into the stern-sheets, sat on the aftmost\nthwart myself, and for the lives of us all pulled back towards the bank\nwe had lately quitted. By casting all the weight thus astern, I raised\nthe leak up to the water-line, except when we plunged to the lift of the\noars, and the water poured in less rapidly now, with the set of the tide\non our starboard beam. However, with all this, and all my speed, and my\npassengers showing great presence of mind, we barely managed to touch\nthe bank and jump out, when down she foundered.\n\nAt first I was at a loss altogether even to guess how this thing had\nhappened; for the boat seemed perfectly sound and dry at the time of our\nleaving the shore. But as soon as the tide was out, and I could get at\nher, I perceived that a trick of entirely fiendish cunning and atrocity\nhad been played upon me. A piece of planking a foot in length and from\neight to ten inches wide had been cut out with a key-hole saw, at the\ntime she was lying high and dry, and doubtless before daybreak. This had\nbeen then replaced most carefully with a little caulking, so that it was\nwater-tight without strong pressure from outside; but the villain had\ncontrived it, knowing in what state of tide I was likely next to work\nthe ferry, so that the rush of water could not fail to beat the piece\nin.\n\nIt made my blood run cold to think of the stealthiness of this attempt,\nas well as the skill it was compassed with, for the chances were ten to\none almost in favour of its drowning me, and leaving a bad name behind\nme too, for having drowned my passengers. And to this it must have come\nif so much as a single woman had been in the boat that day. For these,\nwhen in danger, always do the very worst thing possible; and the manager\nof this clever scheme knew of course that my freight was likely, on the\nChristmas morning, to be chiefly female. Luckily I had refused two\nboat-loads of young and attractive womankind, not from religious feeling\nonly, but because I had to chop a trencherful of stuffing.\n\nThis affair impressed me so with a sense of awe and reverence, and a\ncertainty that Parson Chowne must be in direct receipt of counsel from\nthe evil one, that my mind was good to be off at once, and thank the\nLord for escaping him. For let us see what must have happened but for\nthe goodness and fatherly care of a merciful Providence over me. The\nboat would have sunk in the very midst of the rapid and icy river. David\nLlewellyn, with his accustomed fortitude, would have endeavoured to swim\nashore, and yet could not have resisted the claims of three or even four\nyoung women, who doubtless would have laid hold of him, all screaming,\nsplashing, and dragging him down. The mind refuses to contemplate such a\npicture any longer!\n\nThis matter could not be kept quiet, as the first attempt had been, but\nspread from house to house, and gained in size from each successive\ntongue, until the man at the foot of the bridge, who naturally detested\nme, whispered into every ear, that it was high time to have a care of\nthat interloping Welshman, who had drowned six fine young noblemen, for\nthe sake of their buckles and watches. And my courage was at so low an\nebb, that when he retreated into his house, I could not even bring my\nmind to the power of kicking his door in. Hence that calumny, not being\nquenched, went the round of the neighbourhood; and I might as well haul\ndown my sign, and the hopes of any public-house became a fading vision.\nAnd of all the fine young women who had set their hearts upon keeping it\n(as I described my intention to them), and who had picked up bits of\nWelsh, for an access to my heart in all its patriotism, there was not\none worth looking at, or fit to be a landlady, who took the trouble to\ncome near me, in the frosty weather.\n\nWhen a man is forsaken by the world, he must have recourse to reason.\nAnd if only borne up thereby, and with a little cash in hand, he can\nwait till the world comes round again. This was my position now. I never\nhad behaved so well in all my life before, I think; though always\nconscientious. But of late I had felt, as it were, in one perpetual\nround of bitter wrestling with the evil one. Men of a loose kind may not\nsee that this was tenfold hard upon me, from my props being knocked\naway. I mean my entire trust and leaning upon the ancient Church of\nEngland, which (perhaps by repulsion from those fellows that came after\nour old ham, as well as our proper parson's knowledge of soles and the\nway to fry them) had increased upon me so, that my heart leaped up\nwhenever I heard the swing of a bell on Sunday. Some of this perhaps\nwas owing to my thoughts of Newton clock, and twelve shillings now due\nto me from my captainship thereof: but how could this loyal and\necclesiastical fervour thrive, while a man in holy orders did such\nunholy things to me?\n\nThe only one with faith enough, and sense enough, to stand by me now,\nthrough this bitter trial, was that beautiful young lady, whom I did\nadmire so. And if till now I admired only, now I did adore her. Nanette\ndid for herself with me, and all her hopes of ever being Mrs David\nLlewellyn, by poking up her little toes,--and I saw that they were all\nsquare almost,--and with guttural noises crying that on board my boat\nshe would not dare. Miss Carey laughed at her, and stepped with her\nbeautiful boots on board of me; and from that moment she might do\nexactly as she pleased with me.\n\nHowever my ferry was knocked on the head; and all the hopes of a wife\nand family, and even a public-house and skittles, which I had long been\nbuilding up, as well as to train our Bunny for barmaid; which must\nalways be done quite young, to get the proper style of it, and thorough\nacquaintance with measures, how to make them look quite brim up when\nthey are only three-parts full. All golden dreams will vanish thus; no\nlife of smiling Boniface, but of gun-muzzles was before me; no\ncasting-up of shot by pence, but ramming down on pounds of powder. Let\nthat pass; my only wish is to conceal, in the strictest manner, little\ntrifles about myself.\n\nIsabel Carey was so shocked at hearing of our danger (as by me\ndistinctly told without a word of flourish), that she made me promise\nstrongly to give up my ferrying. This I was becoming ready, more and\nmore every day, to do; especially as nobody ever now came down for\nporterage. But I told the lady how hard it was to have formed such a\nvaluable trade, or you might say an institution; and then to lose it\nall, because of certain private enmities. What she said or did hereon is\nstrictly a family question, and can in no way concern the public, since\nI hauled my flag down.\n\nAnd now I gained more insight into my great enemy's schemes and doings,\nthan I could have acquired while engaged so much at ferry. For time\nallowed me to maintain that strict watch upon Narnton Court, which was\nnow become my duty, as well as an especial pleasure, for the following\nreason. I began to see most clearly that the foul outrage upon my boat\nmust have been perpetrated by one or both of those savage fellows who\nwere employed as spies upon this great house, from the landward side.\nThey must have forded the river, which is not more than three feet deep\nin places, when the tide is out, and no floods coming down. These two\ncunning barbarians came of course from the Nympton rookery, but were\nlodging for the present in a hole they had scooped for themselves in the\nloneliest part of Braunton Burrows. Of course they durst not go about in\na peopled and civilised neighbourhood, with such an absence of apparel\nas they could indulge at home. Still they were unsightly objects; and\ndecent people gave them a wide berth, when possible. But my firm\nintention was to grapple with these savage scoundrels, and to prove at\ntheir expense what a civilised Welshman is, and how capable of asserting\nhis commercial privileges. Only as they carried knives, I durst not meet\nthem both at once; and even should I catch them singly, some care was\nadvisable, so as take them off their guard; because I would not lower\nmyself to the use of anything more barbarous than an honest cudgel.\n\nHowever, although I watched and waited, and caught sight of them more\nthan once, especially at night-time when they roved most freely, it was\nlong before I found it prudent to bear down on the enemy. Not from any\nfear of them, but for fear of slaying them, as I might be forced to do,\nif they rushed with steel at me.\n\nOne night, after the turn of the days, and with mild weather now\nprevailing, and a sense of spring already fluttering in the valleys, I\nsat in a dark embrasure at the end of Narnton Court. There had been more\nlight than usual in the windows of the great dining-room, which now was\nvery seldom used for hospitable purposes. And now two gentlemen came\nforth, as if for a little air, to take a turn on the river-terrace. It\ndid not cost me long to learn that one was good Sir Philip Bampfylde,\nand the other that very wicked Chowne. The latter had manifestly been\ntelling some of his choicest stories, and held the upper hand as usual.\n\n\"General, take my arm. The flags are rough, and the night is of the\ndarkest. You must gravel this terrace, for the sake of your guests,\nafter your port-wine.\"\n\n\"Dick,\" said the General, with a sigh, for he was a most hospitable man,\nand accustomed to the army; \"Dick, thou hast hardly touched my port; and\nI like not to have it slighted, sir.\"\n\nWhat excuse the Parson made I did not hear, but knew already that one of\nhis countless villanies was his rude contempt of the gift of God, as\nvouchsafed to Noah, and confirmed by the very first rainbow, which\ncontinues the colours thereof up to this time of writing.\n\nSir Philip leaned on the parapet some twenty yards to windward of me,\nand he sniffed the fine fresh smell of sea-weed and sea-water coming up\nthe river with a movement of four knots an hour. And in his heart he\nthanked the Lord, very likely without knowing it. Then he seemed to sigh\na little, and to turn to Chowne, and say--\n\n\"Dick, this is not as it should be. Look at all this place, and up and\ndown all this length of river; every light you can see burning, is in a\nhouse that 'longs to me. And who is now to have it all? It used to make\nme proud; but now it makes me very humble. You are a parson; tell me,\nDick, what have I done to deserve it all?\"\n\nThe Rev. Richard Stoyle Chowne had not--whatever his other vices\nwere--one grain of pious hypocrisy in all his foul composition. If he\nhad, he might have flourished, and with his native power, must have been\none of the foremost men of this, or any other age. But his pride allowed\nhim never to let in pretence religious into the texture of his ways. A\nworse man need not be desired: and yet he did abhor all cant, to such a\ndegree that he made a mock of his own church-services.\n\n\"General, I have nought to say. You have asked this question more than\nonce. You know what my opinion is.\"\n\n\"I know that you have the confidence, sir, every honourable man must\nhave, in my poor son's innocence. You support it against every one.\"\n\n\"Against all the world: against even you, when you allow yourself to\ndoubt it. Tush! I would not twice think of it. However many candles\nburn\"--this was a touch of his nasty sarcasm, which he never could deny\nhimself--\"up and down the valley, General, no son of yours, however\nwild, and troubled in expenditure, could ever shape or even dream of\nanything dishonourable.\"\n\n\"I hope not--I hope to God, not,\" Sir Philip said, with a little gasp,\nas if he were fearing otherwise: \"Dick, you are my godson, and you have\nbeen the greatest comfort to me; because you never would believe----\"\n\n\"Not another word, General. You must not dwell on this matter so. The\nchildren were fine little dears of course, very clever and very\nprecious----\"\n\n\"Oh, if you only knew the words, Dick, my little granddaughter could\ncome out with! Scarcely anything you could think of would have been too\nbig for her little mouth. And if she could not do it once, she never\nleft it till she did. Where it came from I could not tell, for we are\nnot great at languages: but it must have been of her mother's race. And\nthe boy, though not with gifts of that sort--oh, you ought to have seen\nhis legs, Dick--at least till he took the whooping-cough!\" The stately\nold gentleman leaned, and dropped a tear perhaps into the river Tawe.\n\n\"General, I understand it all,\" said Chowne, though he never had a\nchild, by reason of the Almighty's mercy to the next generation: \"of\ncourse these pretty children were a great delight to every one. But\naffairs of this sort happen in all ancient families. The mere extent of\nland appears to open for clandestine graves----\"\n\n\"That wicked devilish story, Dick! Did you tell me, or did you not, to\ntake it as the Fiend's own lie?\"\n\n\"A lie, of course, as concerns the Captain: from their want of\nknowledge. But concerning some one else, true enough, I fear, I fear.\"\n\nBoth men had by this time very nearly said their say throughout. The\nGeneral seemed to be overcome, and the Parson to be growing weary of a\nsubject often treated in discourse between them. \"Before you go in the\nmorning, Dick,\" said the old man, now recovering, \"I wish to consult you\nabout a matter nearly concerning young Isabel. She is a distant cousin\nof yours. You thoroughly understand the law, of which I have very little\nknowledge. Perhaps you will meet me in the book-room, for half an hour's\nquiet talk, before we go to breakfast.\"\n\n\"I cannot do it, Sir Philip. I have my own affairs to see to: I must be\noff when the moon is up. I cannot sleep in your house, this night.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\nFORCIBLE EJECTMENT.\n\n\nThose things which have been settled for us by long generations of\nancestors, all of whom must have considered the subjects, one after the\nother painfully, and brought good minds of ancient strength (less led\naway than ours are) to bear upon what lay before them, also living in a\ntime when money went much further, and got a deal more change in\nhonesty, which was then more plentiful--to rush, I say, against the\nbulwarks of our noble elders (who showed the warmth of their faith by\nroasting all who disagreed with them), would be, ay and ever will be, a\nproof of a rebellious, scurvy, and perpetually scabby nature. The above\nfine reflection came home to me, just as my pipe grew sweet and rich,\nafter an excellent dinner, provided by that most thoughtful and bright\nyoung lady, the Honourable Isabel Carey, upon a noble New Year's Day, in\nthe year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three. Her\nladyship now had begun to feel that interest in my intelligence and\nunusual power of narrative, as well as that confidence in my honour and\nextreme veracity, which, without the smallest effort or pretence on my\npart, seem to spring by some law of nature in every candid mind I meet.\n\nCombining this lady's testimonials, as presented weekly, with some\nhonourable trifles picked up here and there along shore, in spite of all\ndiscouragement, perhaps I congratulated myself on having turned the\ncorner of another year not badly. I counted my money, to the tune of\nfive-and-twenty level pounds; an amount of cash beyond all experience!\nYet, instead of being dazzled, I began to see no reason for not having\nfifty. Not that I ever thought of money; but for the sake of the\nchildren. The tears came into my eyes, to think of these poor little\ncreatures; Bardie with all her fount of life sanded up (as one might\nsay) in that old Sker warren; and Bunny with her strength of feeding\nweakened over rice and fowl-food; such as old Charles Morgan kept, who\nhad been known to threaten to feed his family upon sawdust. A most\nrespectable man, as well as churchwarden and undertaker; but being bred\na pure carpenter, he thought (when his money came in fast, and great\nsuccess surprised him) that Providence would be offended at his waste of\nsawdust.\n\nNow this was the man who had Bunny to keep, entirely from his own wish\nof course, or the sense of the village concerning her; and many times I\nhad been ready to laugh, and as many times to cry almost, whenever I\nthought of the many things that were likely to happen between them. To\nlaugh, when I thought of Churchwarden's face regarding our Bunny at\nbreakfast-time, and the way she would say, \"I want some more,\" through\nhis narrow-shouldered children. To cry, when I thought of my dear son's\nchild (and as dear to me as my own almost) getting less of victuals\ndaily, as her welcome should grow staler, and giving way to her old\ntrick of standing on the floor with eyes shut, and with shut mouth to\ndeclare, \"I won't eat, now you have starved me so;\" and no one in that\nhouse with wit to understand and humour her. And then I could see her go\nto bed, in a violent temper anyhow: and when the wind boxed round to\nnorth, I could hear her calling, \"Granny.\"\n\nThis very tender state of mind, and sense of domestic memories, seems to\nhave drawn me (so far as I can, in a difficult case, remember it)\ntowards a very ancient inn having two bow-windows. When I entered, no\nman could be in a stricter state of sobriety: and as if it were\nyesterday, I remember asking the price of everything. The people were\neven inclined to refuse to draw anything in the small-liquor line for a\nman with so little respect for trade as to walk so straight upon New\nYear's Day. After a little while, I made them see that this was not so\nmuch my fault as my misfortune; and when I declared my name, of course,\nand my character came forward, even rum-shrub out of a cask with golden\nhoops around it scarcely seemed to be considered good enough for me,\ngratis. But throughout the whole of this, I felt an anxious and burning\nsense of eager responsibility, coupled with a strong desire to be\neverywhere at once.\n\nRight early, to the very utmost of my recollection, I tumbled into my\nlonely berth, after seeing my fusil primed, and praying to the Lord for\nguidance through another and a better year. I had clean sheets, which\nare my most luxurious gift of feeling; and having no room to stretch my\nlegs, or roll, I managed space to yawn, and then went off deliciously.\nNow I was beginning to dream about the hole I had placed my money in--a\nclever contrivance of my own, and not in the cuddy at all, because the\nenemy might attack me there--when a terrible fit of coughing came and\nsaved my life by waking me. The little cuddy was full of\nsmoke--parching, blinding, choking smoke--so thick that I could scarcely\nsee the red glare of fire behind it, through the brattice of the\nbulkhead.\n\n\"Good Lord,\" I cried, \"have mercy on me! Sure enough, I am done for now.\nAnd nobody ever will know or care what the end was of old Dyo!\"\n\nI did not stop still to say all this, that you may be quite sure of, and\nit argues no small power of speech that I was able to say anything. For\nwith a last desire for life, and despairing resolve to try again, I\nbroke my knuckles against the hatch which I had made so heavy for the\npurpose of protecting me. To go out through my door would have been to\nrush into the fire itself; and what with the choking, and the thickness,\nand the terror of the flames violently reddening and roaring a few feet\naway, I felt my wits beginning to fail me, which of course was certain\ndeath. So I sate down on a three-legged stool, which was all my\nfurniture; and for a moment the rushing smoke drew, by some draught,\notherwhere; and whether I would or no, a deal of my past life came up to\nme. I wondered whether I might have been too hard sometimes on any one,\nor whether I might have forgotten to think of the Lord, upon any Sunday.\nAnd then my thoughts were elevated to the two dear children.\n\nNow what do you think happened to me, when I thought of those two\ndarlings, and the tears from smoke made way for the deep-born tears of a\nnoble heart? Why simply that a flash of flame glanced upon the iron\ncrowbar, wherewith I had opened hatch. I could not have been in pure\nbright possession of my Maker's gifts to me when I chanced, before going\nto bed, to lay that crowbar for my pillow-case. Nevertheless I had done\nit well: and in the stern perception of this desperate extremity, I\ncould not help smiling at the way I had tucked up my head on the\ncrowbar. But (though no time is lost in smiling) I had not a moment to\nlose even now, although with my utmost wits all awake and coughing. I\nprised the hatch up in half a moment, where it was stuck in the\ncombings; and if ever a man enjoyed a draught, I did so of air that\nmoment. Many men might have been frightened still, and not have known\nwhat to do with themselves. But I assure you, in all honour, that the\nwhole of my mind came back quite calmly, when I was out of smothering.\nPeople may say what they like; but I know, after seeing every form of\ndeath (and you need not laugh at me very much, if I even said feeling\nit)--I know no anguish to be compared to the sense of being pressed\nunder slowly; and the soul with no room to get away.\n\nBut I was under the good stars now, and able to think and to look about;\nand though the ketch could not last long, being of 92 tons only, I found\ntime enough to kneel and thank my God for His mercy to me. There was no\nice in the river now, and to swim ashore would have been but little,\nexcept for rheumatics afterwards. But it seemed just as well to escape\neven these; and having been burned out at sea before, I was better\nenabled to manage it. The whole of the waist of the ketch was in flames,\ncurling and beginning now to indulge their desire of roaring; but the\nkindness of the Lord prevented wind from blowing. Had there been only a\nfour-knot breeze, you would never have heard of me again; surely which\nwould grieve you.\n\nIn this very sad state of mind, combined with a longing for\nthankfulness, and while I was thinking about the fire--to say the truth,\nvery stupidly, and wondering instead of working--quite an old-fashioned\naffair restored me to my wits and my love of the world again. This was\nthe strong sour sound of the air when a bullet comes through it hastily,\nand casting reproach upon what we breathe, for its want of a stronger\nactivity. A man had made a shot at me, and must have been a lubber by\nhis want of range and common-sense. Before I could think, I was all\nalive, and fit to enjoy myself almost, as if it were a fight with\nFrenchmen. The first thing I thought of was the gun lent to me by Miss\nCarey. To rescue this, I went down even into the cuddy which had so\nlately proved my very grave almost; and after this I saw no reason why I\nshould not save my money, if the Lord so willed it. From a sense of all\nthe mischief even now around me, I had made a clever hole in the\nbow-knees of the ketch (where the wood lay thickest), and so had plugged\nmy money up, with the power to count it daily. And now in spite of\nflame, and roar, and heat of all the 'midships, and the spluttering of\nthe rock-powder bags too wet to be unanimous, I made my mind up just to\ntry to save my bit of money.\n\nBecause, although a man may be as coarse, and wicked, and vile-hearted,\nas even my very worst enemies are, he cannot fail of getting on, and\nbeing praised, and made the best of, if he only does his best to stick\ntight to his money. Therefore, having no boat within reach, and the\n'midship all aflame, I made a raft of the cuddy-hatch, and warped along\nby the side of the ketch, and purchased my cash from its little nest;\nand then with a thankful heart, and nothing but a pair of breeches on,\nmade the best of my way ashore, punting myself with a broken oar.\n\nThis desire to sacrifice me (without the trouble even taken to count\nwhat my value was) gave me such a sense of shock, and of spreading\nabroad everywhere, without any knowledge left of what might have become\nof me, and the subject liable to be dropped, if ever entered into by a\nJolly Crowner, and a jury glad to please him, that for the moment I\nsate down upon a shelf of clay, until the wet came through my want of\nclothes. Suddenly this roused me up to make another trial for the sake\nof my well-accustomed and familiar suit of clothes, so well beloved;\nalso even my Sunday style, more striking but less comfortable; in lack\nof which the world could never have gone on in our neighbourhood.\nTherefore I ran to my little punt, and pushed off and was just in time\nto save my kit, with a little singeing.\n\nThe ketch burned down to the water's edge, and then a rough tide came up\nand sank her, leaving me in a bitter plight, and for some time quite\nuncertain how to face the future. From knowledge of the Parson's style\nof treating similar cases, I felt it to be a most likely thing that I\nshould be charged with firing her, robbing her, and concealing booty.\nAnd this injustice added to the bitterness of my close escape. \"It is no\nuse,\" I said aloud; \"it is useless to contend with him. He has sold\nhimself to Satan, and, thank God, I have no chance with him.\" Therefore\nby the time the fire had created some disturbance in the cottage\nbedrooms, I had got my clothing on, in a decent though hasty manner, and\nslipped into a little wood with my spy-glass, happily saved, and\nresolved to watch what happened in among the bumpkins.\n\nThese came down, and stared and gawked, and picked up bits of singed\nspars, and so on, and laid down the law to one another, and fought for\nthe relics, and thought it hard that no man's body was to be found with\nclothes on. I saw them hunting for me, up and down the river channel,\nwith a desperate ignorance of tide (although living so close to it), and\nI did not like to have my body hunted for like that. But I repressed all\nfiner feelings, as a superior man must do, and chewed the tip of a\nbullock's tongue, which luckily was in my waistcoat-pocket, ready for\ngreat emergency; and which, if a man keeps going on with, he may go,\nlike the great Elijah, forty days, and feel no hunger. At least, I have\nheard so, and can believe it, having seen men who told me so; but I\nwould rather have it proved by another man's experience.\n\nWhile I was looking on at these things, down came Parson Chowne himself,\nin a happy mood, and riding the black mare, now brought out of dock\nagain. The country folk all fell away from their hope of stealing\nsomething, and laid fingers to their hats, being afraid to talk of him.\nHe, however, did no more than sign to the serving-man behind him, to\nacknowledge compliments (which was outside his own custom), and then he\nput spurs to his horse and galloped right and left through the lot of\nthem. In my anxiety to learn what this dreadful man was up to, I slipped\ndown through the stubs of the wood, where the faggot-cutters had been at\nwork, gliding even upon my jersey, because of the Parson's piercing\neyes, and there in the ditch I found some shelter, and spied through a\nbushy breastwork.\n\n\"No more than I expected,\" he cried, \"from what I have seen of the\nfellow; he has fired the ship, and run away with all he could lay hands\non. As a Justice of the Peace, I offer ten pounds reward for David\nLlewellyn, brought before me, alive or dead. Is there one of you\nrantipoles can row? Oh, you can. Take this shilling, and be off with\nthat big thief's ferry-boat, and leave it at Sam Tucker's shipyard, in\nthe name of the Reverend Stoyle Chowne.\"\n\nIt went to my heart that none of the people to whom I had been so \"good\nand kind\"--to use pretty Bardie's phrase--now had the courage to stand\nup, and say that my character was most noble, and claim back my boat for\nme. Instead of that, they all behaved as if I had never ferried them;\nand the ingratitude of the young women made me long to be in Wales\nagain. Because, you may say what you like; but the first point in our\npeople is gratitude.\n\n\"Of course,\" cried Chowne, and his voice, though gently used, came down\nthe wind like a bell; \"of course, good people, you have not found the\ncorpse of that wretched villain.\"\n\n\"Us would giv' un up, glad enough, if us only gat the loock, for tan\nzhilling, your Raverance. Lave aloun tan poond.\"\n\nWhen that miserable miser said a thing so low as that, my very flesh\ncrept on my bones, and my inmost heart was sick with being made so very\nlittle of. To myself I always had a proper sense of estimation; and to\nbe put at this low figure made me doubt of everything. However, I came\nto feel, after a bit, that this is one of the trials which all good men\nmust put up with: neither would a common man find his corpse worth ten\npounds sterling.\n\nBetwixt my sense of public value (a definite sum, at any rate) and\nimagination of what my truly natural abilities might lead me to, if\nproperly neglected, I found it a blessed hard thing to lie quiet until\ndark, and then slip out. And the more so, because my stock of food was\nall consumed by middle day; and before the sun went down, hunger of a\ngreat shape and size arose and raged within me. This is always\ndifficult to discipline or to reason with; and to men of the common\norder it suggests great violence. To me it did nothing of that kind, but\nled me into a little shop, where I paid my money, and got my loaf. My\nflint and steel and tinder-box lay in my pocket handy. These I felt and\nfelt again, and went into the woods and thought, and found that even\nwant of food had failed to give me a thorough-going and consistent\nappetite. Because, for the first time in my life, I had shaped a strong\nresolve, and sworn to the Lord concerning it--to commit a downright\ncrime, and one which I might be hanged for. Although every one who has\nentered into my sufferings and my dignity must perceive how right I was,\nand would never inform against me, I will only say that on Saturday\nevening Parson Chowne had fourteen ricks, and on Sunday morning he had\nnone, and might begin to understand the feelings of the many farmers who\nhad been treated thus by him. Right gladly would I have beheld his face\n(so rigid and contemptuous at other people's trouble) when he should\ncome to contemplate his own works thus brought home to him. But I could\nnot find a hedge thick enough to screen me from his terrible piercing\neyes.\n\nThis little bit of righteous action made a stir, you may be sure,\nbecause it was so contrary to the custom of the neighbourhood. Although\nI went to see this fire, I took the finest care to leave no evidence\nbehind me; and even turned my bits of toggery inside out at starting.\nBut there was a general sense in among these people, that only a\nforeigner could have dared to fly in the Parson's face so. I waited long\nenough to catch the turn of the public feeling, and finding it set hard\nagainst me, my foremost thought was the love of home.\n\nKeeping this in view, and being pressed almost beyond bearing now, with\nno certainty, moreover, as to warrants coming out, and the people\nlooking strangely, every time they met me, I could have no peace until I\nsaw the beautiful young lady, and to her told everything. You should\nhave seen her eyes and cheeks, as well as the way her heart went; and\nthe pride with which she gathered all her meaning up to speak; even\nafter I had told her how the ricks would burn themselves.\n\n\"You dear old Davy,\" she said, \"I never thought you had so much courage.\nYou are the very bravest man--but stop, did you burn the whole of them?\"\n\n\"Every one burned itself, your ladyship; I saw the ashes dying down, and\nhis summer-house as well took fire, through the mischief of the wind,\nand all his winter stock of wood, and his tool-house, and his----\"\n\n\"Any more, any more, old David?\"\n\n\"Yes, your ladyship, his cow-house, after the cows were all set free,\nand his new cart-shed fifty feet long, also his carpenter's shop, and\nhis cider-press.\"\n\n\"You are the very best man,\" she answered, with her beautiful eyes full\nupon me, \"that I have seen, since I was a child. I must think what to do\nfor you. Did you burn anything more, old Davy?\"\n\n\"The fire did, your ladyship, three large barns, and a thing they call a\n'linhay;' also the granary, and the meal-house, and the apple-room, and\nthe churn-room, and only missed the dairy by a little nasty slant of\nwind.\"\n\n\"What a good thing you have done! There is scarcely any man I know, that\nwould have shown such courage. Mr Llewellyn, is there anything in my\npower to do for you?\"\n\nNothing could have pleased me more than to find this fair young lady\nrejoicing in this generous manner at the Parson's misadventure. And her\ndelight in the contemplation made me almost feel repentance at the\ndelicate forbearance of the flames from the Rectory itself. But I could\nnot help reflecting how intense and bitter must be this young harmless\ncreature's wrong received and dwelling in her mind, ere she could find\npleasure from wild havoc and destruction.\n\n\"There is one thing you can do,\" I answered very humbly; \"and it is my\nonly chance to escape from misconstruction. I never thought, at my time\nof life, to begin life so again. But I am now a homeless man, burned out\nof my latest refuge, and with none to care for me. Perhaps I may be\ntaken up to-morrow, or the next day. And with such a man against me, it\nmust end in hanging.\"\n\n\"I never heard such a thing,\" she said: \"he tries to burn you in your\nbed, after blowing you up, and doing his very best to drown you; and\nthen you are to be hanged because there is a bonfire on his premises! It\nis impossible, Mr Llewellyn, to think twice of such a thing.\"\n\n\"Your ladyship may be right,\" I answered; \"and in the case of some one\nelse, reasoning would convince me. But if I even stop to think twice, it\nwill lead to handcuffs; and handcuffs lead to halter.\"\n\nAt this she began to be frightened much, and her fright grew worse, as I\ndescribed the unpleasantness of hanging; how I had helped myself to run\nup nine good men at the yard-arm. And a fine thing for their souls, no\ndoubt, to stop them from more mischief, and let them go up while the\nLord might think that other men had injured them.\n\n\"Your ladyship,\" I began again, when I saw all her delicate colour\nebbing; \"it is not for a poor hunted man to dare to beg a favour.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, it is, it is,\" she cried; \"that is the very time to do it.\nAnything in my power, David, after all you have done for me.\"\n\n\"Then all that I want of your ladyship is to get me rated aboard of\nCaptain Drake Bampfylde's ship.\"\n\nShe coloured up so clearly that I was compelled to look away: and then\nshe said--\n\n\"How do you know--I mean who can have told you that--but are you not\ntoo--perhaps a little----\"\n\n\"Too old, your ladyship? Not a day. I am worth half-a-dozen of those\nyoung chips who have got no bones to their legs yet. And as for\nshooting, if his Honour wants a man to train a cannon, I can hit a\nmarlinspike with a round-shot, at a mile and a half, as soon as I learn\nthe windage.\"\n\nFor I knew by this time that Captain Bampfylde's ship, the Alcestis, was\nin reserve, as a feeder for the Royal Navy, to catch young hands and\ntrain them to some knowledge of sealife, and smartness, and the styles\nof gunnery. And who could teach them these things better than a veteran\nlike me?\n\nMiss Carey smiled at my conceit, as perhaps she considered it; \"Well,\nDavy, if you can fire a gun, as well as you can a hay-rick----\"\n\n\"No more, your ladyship, I beseech you. Even walls like these have ears;\nand every time I see my shadow, I take it for a constable. I am sure\nthere are two men after me----\"\n\n\"Have you then two shadows?\" she asked, in her peculiar pleasant way:\n\"at any rate no one will dare to meddle with you, or any of us, I should\nhope, in the General's own house. Come in here. I expect, or at least I\nthink, there is some prospect of a boat from the Alcestis coming up the\nriver this very evening. Perhaps you have some baggage.\"\n\n\"No, your ladyship, not a bit. They burned me out of all of it. But I\nsaved some money kindly, by special grace of God, at the loss of all my\nleg-hair.\"\n\nI ought not to have said that, I knew, directly after uttering it, to a\nyoung lady who could not yet be up to things of that kind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nTHE RIGHT MAN IN THE RIGHT PLACE.\n\n\nThe very next day, I was afloat as a seaman of the Royal Navy of the\nUnited Kingdom. None but a sailor can imagine what I felt and what I\nthought. Here for years I had been adrift from the very work God shaped\nme for, wrecked before my time by undue violence of a Frenchman. Also I\nhad bred my son up to supply my place a little; and a very noble fellow,\nthough he could not handle cutlash or lay gun as I had done. But he\nmight have come to it if he ever had come to my own time of life. This\nhowever had been cut short by the will of Providence; and now I felt\nbound to make good for it. Only one thing grieved me, viz., to find the\nwar declining. This went to my heart the more, because our Navy had not\ndone according to its ancient fame, anywhere but at Gibraltar and with\nAdmiral Rodney, in the year before I rejoined it. Off the coast of\nAmerica, things I could not bear to hear; also the loss of the Royal\nGeorge, the capture of the Leeward Islands, and of Minorca by the\nFrench; and even a British sloop of war taken by a French corvette. Such\nthings moved me to the marrow, after all I had seen and done; and all\nour ship's company understood that I returned to the service in the hope\nto put a stop to it. This reclaiming of me to the thing that I was meant\nfor took less time than I might use to bring a gun to its bearings. That\nbeautiful Miss Carey managed everything with Captain Drake, and in less\nthan fifty kisses they had settled my affairs. I could have no more\nself-respect, if I said another word.\n\nBut the King and the nation won the entire benefit of this. It came to\npass that I was made a second-instructor in gunnery, with an entire new\nkit found me, and six-and-twopence a-week appointed, together with\nsecond right to stick a fork into the boiler. Of course I could not have\nwon all this by favour; but showed merit. It had however been allowed\nme, under an agreement (just enough, yet brought about by special love\nof justice) that I should receive a month ashore at Newton-Nottage, in\nthe course of the spring, whenever it might suit our cruising. My\nprivate affairs demanded this; as well as love of neighbours, and\nstrong desire to let them know how much they ought to make of me.\n\nHow I disdained my rod and pole, and the long-shore life and the\nlubberly ways, when I felt once more the bounding of the open water, the\nspring of the buoyant timbers answering every movement gallantly, the\ngenerous vehemence of the canvas, and the noble freedom of the ocean\nwinds around us! The rush up a liquid mountain, and the sway on the\nbalance of the world, then the plunge into the valley, almost out of the\nsight of God, though we feel Him hovering over us. While the heart leaps\nwith the hope of yet more glorious things to come--the wild delight, the\nrage, suspense, and majesty of battle.\n\nNothing vexed me now so much as to hear from private people, and even\nfrom the public sailors, that the nation wanted peace. No nation ever\nshould want peace, until it has thoroughly thrashed the other, or is\nbound by wicked luck to knock under hopelessly. And neither of those\nthings had befallen England at this period. But I have not skill enough\nto navigate in politics. And before we had been long at sea, we spoke a\nfull-rigged ship from Hamburg, which had touched at Falmouth; and two\nGerman boys, in training for the British Navy, let us know that peace\nwas signed between Great Britain, France, and Spain, as nearly as might\nbe on Valentine's Day of the year 1783. A sad and hard thing we found to\nbelieve it, and impossible to be pleased after such practice of gunnery.\n\nNevertheless it was true enough, and confirmed by another ship; and now\na new Ministry was in office under a man of the name of Fox, doubtless\nof that nature also, ready always to run to earth. Nothing more could be\nhoped except to put up with all degradation. A handful of barbarous\nfellows, wild in the woods and swamps of America, most of them sent from\nthis home-country through their contempt of discipline, fellows of this\nsort had been able (mainly by skulking and shirking fight) to elude and\nget the better of His Britannic Majesty's forces, and pretend to set up\non their own account, as if they could ever get on so. No one who sees\nthese things as clearly as I saw them then and there, can doubt as to\nthe call I felt to rejoin the Royal Navy.\n\nOf course I could not dream that now there was rising in a merchant-ship\ncaptured from the Frenchmen, and fitted with two dozen guns, a British\nCaptain such as never had been seen before, nor will ever be again; and\nwhose skill and daring left the Frenchmen one hope only--to run ashore,\nand stay there.\n\nHowever, not to dwell too long on the noblest and purest motives, it did\nnot take me quite three weeks to supersede the first instructor, and to\nget him sent ashore, and find myself hoisted into his berth, with a rise\nof two-and-two per week. This gave me eight-and-fourpence, with another\nstripe on my right arm, and what was far more to the purpose, added\ngreatly to the efficiency of the British Navy. Because the man was very\nwell, or at any rate well enough, in his way and in his manners, and\nquite worth his wages; but to see him train a gun, and to call him First\nInstructor! Captain Bampfylde saw, in twenty minutes, that I could shoot\nthis fine fellow's head off, unwilling as I was to give offence, and\ndelicate about priming. And all the men felt at once the power of a\npractised hand set over them. I saw that the Navy had fallen back very\nmuch in the matter of gunnery, in the time of the twenty years, or so,\nsince I had been Gun-captain; and it came into my head to show them many\nthings forgotten. The force of nature carried me into this my proper\nposition; and the more rapidly, because it happened to occur to me that\nhere was the very man pointed out, as it were by the hand of Providence,\nfor Parson Chowne to blow up next. Our Captain had the very utmost\nconfidence that could be in him, and he stood on his legs with a breadth\nthat spoke to the strength of his constitution; a man of enduring\ngravity. Also his weight was such that the Parson never could manage to\nblow him up, with any powder as yet admitted into the Royal Dockyards. I\nliked this man, and I let him know it; but I thought it better for him\nto serve his country on shore a little, after being so long afloat; if\n(as I put it to his conscience) he could keep from poaching, and from\nfiring stackyards, or working dangerous ferries. He told me that he had\nno temptation towards what I had mentioned; but on the other hand felt\ninclined, after so many years at sea, to have a family of his own; and a\nwife, if found consistent. This I assured him I could manage; and in a\nfew words did so; asking for nothing more on his part than entire\nconfidence. My nature commanded this from him; and we settled to\nexchange our duties in a pleasant manner. I gave him introduction to the\nliveliest of the farmers' daughters, telling him what their names were.\nAnd being over-full of money, he paid me half-a-crown apiece, for\nthirteen girls to whom I gave him letters of commendation. This was far\ntoo cheap, with all of them handsomer than he had any right to; and\nthree of them only daughters, and two with no more than grandmothers.\nBut I love to help a fellow-sailor; and thus I got rid of him. For our\nCaptain had the utmost faith in this poor man's discretion, and had\nthought, before I said it, of laying him up at Narnton Court, to keep a\ngeneral look-out, because his eyes were failing. I did not dare to offer\nmore opinion than was asked for, but it struck me that if Parson Chowne\nhad been too clever for David Llewellyn, and made the place too hot for\nhim, he was not likely to be outwitted by Naval Instructor Heaviside.\n\nHowever, I could not see much occasion for Chowne to continue his plots\nany longer, or even to keep watch on the house, unless it were from\njealousy of our Captain's visits. As far as any one might fathom that\nunfathomable Parson, he had two principal ends in view. The first was to\nget possession of Miss Carey and all her property, by making her Mrs\nChowne, No. 4; the second, which would help him towards the first, was\nto keep up against poor Captain Drake the horrible charge of having\nkilled those two children, whose burial had been seen as before related.\nAnd here I may mention what I had forgotten, through entire want of\nvindictive feeling--to wit, that I had, as a matter of duty, contrived\nto thrash very heavily both of those fellows on Braunton Burrows, who\nhad been spying on Narnton Court, and committed such outrages against\nme. Without doing this, I could not have left the county\nconscientiously.\n\nAnd now on board the Alcestis, a rattling fine frigate of 44 guns, it\ngave me no small pleasure to find that (although the gunnery-practice\nwas not so good as I was accustomed to), in seamanship, and discipline,\nand general smartness, there was little to be reasonably complained of;\nespecially when it was borne in mind what our special duty was, and why\nwe were kept in commission when so many other ships were paid off, at\nthe conclusion of the war. Up to that time the Alcestis had orders to\ncruise off the western coasts, not only on account of some French\nprivateers, which had made mischief with our shipping, but also as a\ndraft-ship for receiving and training batches of young hands, who were\ntransferred, as occasion offered, to Halifax, or the West Indies\nstation. And now as the need for new forces ceased, Captain Drake was\nbeginning to expect orders for Spithead to discharge. Instead of that,\nhowever, the Admiralty had determined to employ this ship, which had\ndone so much in the way of education, for the more thorough settlement\nof a question upon which they differed from the general opinion of the\nNavy, and especially of the Ordnance Board. This was concerning the\nvalue of a new kind of artillery invented by a clever Scotchman, and\ncalled a \"Carronade,\" because it was cast at certain iron-works on the\nbanks of the river Carron. This gun is now so thoroughly well known and\napproved, and has done so much to help us to our recent triumphs, that I\nneed not stop to describe it, although at first it greatly puzzled me.\nIt was so short, and light, and handy, and of such large caliber,\nmoreover with a great chamber for the powder, such as a mortar has, that\nat first it quite upset me, knowing that I must appear familiar, yet not\nbeing so. However, I kept in the background, and nodded and shook my\nhead so that every one misunderstood me differently.\n\nThat night I arose and studied it, and resolved to back it up, because\nonly Captain Drake was in its favour, and the first-lieutenant.\nHeaviside was against it strongly, although he said that six months ago\nthe Rainbow, an old 44, being refitted with nothing else but carronades\nof large caliber, had created such terror in a French ship of almost\nequal force, that she fired a broadside of honour, and then surrendered\nto the Rainbow. But to come back to our Alcestis, at the time I was\npromoted to first place in gunnery. Over and above her proper armament\nof long guns, eighteen and twelve pounders, she carried on the\nquarter-deck six 24-pounder carronades, and two of 18 in the forecastle.\nSo that in truth she had fifty-two guns, and was a match in weight of\nmetal for a French ship of sixty guns, as at that time fitted.\nAfterwards it was otherwise; and their artillery outweighed ours, as\nmuch as a true Briton outweighs them.\n\nNow Naval Instructor Mr Llewellyn had such a busy time of it, and was\nfound so indispensable on board the Alcestis, that I do assure you they\ncould not spare him for even a glimpse of old Newton-Nottage, until the\nbeginning of the month of May. But as I always find that people become\nloose in their sense of duty, unless girt up well with money (even as\nthe ancients used to carry their cash in their girdles), I had taken\nadvantage of a run ashore at Pembroke, to send our excellent Parson\nLougher a letter containing a \u00c2\u00a35 note, as well as a few words about my\npresent position, authority, and estimation. I trusted to him as a\ngentleman not to speak of those last matters to any untrustworthy\nperson whatever; because there would be six months' pension falling due\nto me at Swansea, at the very time of writing; and which of course I\nmeant to have; for my zeal in overlooking my wound could not replace me\nunwounded, I trow. But knowing our Government to be thoroughly versed in\nevery form of stinginess and peculation (which was sure to be doubled\nnow a Fox was in), I thought that they might even have the dishonesty to\ndeny me my paltry pittance on account of ancient merit and great valour,\nupon the shabby plea that now I was on full pay again! They would have\ndone so, I do believe, if their own clumsy and careless ways had allowed\nthem to get scent of it. But they do things so stupidly, that a clever\nman need never allow them to commit roguery upon him. And by means of\ndiscreet action, I was enabled for fourteen years to draw the pension I\nhad won so nobly, as well as the pay I was earning so grandly. However,\nthese are trifles.\n\nThe \u00c2\u00a35 note was for Mother Jones, to help our Bunny with spring-clothes,\nand to lay out at her discretion for my grandchild's benefit, supposing\n(as I must needs suppose) that Churchwarden Morgan, in face of his\npromise, would refuse indignantly to accept a farthing for the child's\nnourishment. He disappointed me, however, by accepting four pound ten,\nand Mrs Jones was quite upset; for even Bunny never could have eaten\nthat much in the time. Charles was a worthy man enough (as undertakers\nalways are), but it was said that he could not do according to his\nlights, when fancy brought his wife across them. Poor Mother Jones was\nso put out, that she quite forgot what she was doing until she had spent\nthe ten shillings of change in drawers for her middle children. And so\npoor Bunny got nothing at all; nor even did poorer Bardie. For this\nlittle dear I had begged to be bought, for the sake of her vast\nimagination, nothing less than a two-shilling doll, jointed both at knee\nand elbow, as the Dutchmen turn them out. It was to be naked (like\nParson Chowne's folk), but with the girls at the well stirred up to make\nit more becoming. And then Mother Jones was to go to Sker, and in my\nname present it.\n\nAll things fail, unless a man himself goes and looks after them. And so\nmy \u00c2\u00a35 note did; and when I was able to follow it, complaint was too\nlate, as usual. But you should have seen the village on the day when our\nCaptain Drake--as we delighted to call him--found himself for the first\ntime able to carry out his old promise to me, made beneath the very\neyes of his true-love, Isabel. The thought of this had long been chafing\nin between his sense of honour, and of duty set before him by the\npresent Naval Board. And but for his own deeper troubles, though I did\nmy best for ease, he must have felt discomfort. If I chose, I could give\nmany tokens of what he thought of me, not expressed, nor even hinted;\nyet to my mind palpable. But as long as our Navy lasts, no man will dare\nto intrude on his Captain.\n\nBe it enough, and it was enough, that his Majesty's 44-gun ship Alcestis\nbrought up, as near as her draught allowed, to Porthcawl Point, on the\n5th of May 1783. This was by no means my desire, because it went against\nmy nature to exhibit any grandeur. And I felt in my heart the most warm\ndesire that Master Alexander Macraw might happen to be from home that\nday. Nothing could have grieved me more, than for a man of that small\nnature to behold me stepping up in my handsome uniform, with all the\noars saluting me, and the second-lieutenant in the stern-sheets crying,\n\"Farewell, Mr David!\" also officership marked upon every piece of my\nclothes in sight; and the dignity of my bearing not behind any one of\nthem. But as my evil luck would have it, there was poor Sandy Mac\nhimself, and more half-starved than ever. Such is the largeness of my\nnature, that I sank all memory of wrongs, and upon his touching his hat\nto me I gave him an order for a turbot, inasmuch as my clothes were now\ntoo good, and my time too valuable, to permit of my going fishing.\n\nThis, however, was nothing at all, compared with what awaited me among\nthe people at the well. All Newton was assembled there to welcome and\ncongratulate me, and most of them called me \"Captain Llewellyn,\" and\nevery one said I looked ten years younger in my handsome uniform. I gave\nmyself no airs whatever--that I leave for smaller men--but entered so\nheartily into the shaking of hands, that if I had been a pump, the well\nbeneath us must have gone quite dry. But all this time I was looking for\nBunny, who was not among them; and presently I saw short legs of a size\nand strength unparalleled, except by one another, coming at a mighty\npace down the yellow slope of sand, and scattering the geese on the\nsmall green patches. Mrs Morgan had kept her to smarten up,--and really\nshe was a credit to them, so clean, and bright, and rosy-faced. At first\nshe was shy of my grand appearance; but we very soon made that right.\n\nNow I will not enlarge upon or even hint at the honour done me for\nhaving done such honour to my native place, because as yet I had done\nbut little, except putting that coat on, to deserve it. Enough that I\ndrew my salary for attending to the old church clock, also my pension at\nSwansea, and was feasted and entertained, and became for as long as\ncould be expected the hero of the neighbourhood. And I found that Mother\nJones had kept my cottage in such order, that after a day or two I was\nable to go to Sker for the purpose of begging the favour of a visit from\nBardie.\n\nBut first, as in duty bound, of course, I paid my respects to Colonel\nLougher. As luck would have it, both the worthy Colonel and Lady Bluett\nwere gone from home; but my old friend Crumpy, their honest butler,\nkindly invited me in, and gave me an excellent dinner in his own pantry;\nbecause he did not consider it proper that an officer of the Royal Navy\nshould dine with the maids in the kitchen, however unpretending might be\nhis behaviour. And here, while we were exchanging experience over a fine\nold cordial, in bursts the Honourable Rodney, without so much as\nknocking at the door. Upon seeing me his delight was such that I could\nforgive him anything; and his admiration of my dress, when I stood up\nand made the salute to him, proved that he was born a sailor. A fine\nyoung fellow he was as need be, in his twelfth year now, and come on a\nmitching expedition from the great grammar-school at Cowbridge. To drink\nhis health, both Crumpy and myself had courage for another glass; and\nwhen I began to tell sea-stories, with all the emphasis and expression\nflowing out of my uniform, he was so overpowered that he insisted on a\nhornpipe. This, although it might be now considered under dignity, I\ncould not refuse as a mark of respect for him, and for the service; and\nwhen I had executed, as perhaps no other man can, this loyal and\ninimitable dance, his feelings were carried away so strongly that he\noffered all the money left him by a course of schoolwork (and amounting\nto fourpence-halfpenny) if I would only agree to smuggle him on board\nour Alcestis, when she should come to fetch me.\n\nThis, of course, I could not think of, even for a hundred pounds; and\nmuch as I longed for the boy to have the play of his inclination. And in\nthe presence of Crumpy too, who with all his goodwill to me, would be\nsure to give evidence badly, if his young master were carried away! And\nunder such love and obligation to the noble Colonel, I behaved as a man\nshould do, when having to deal with a boyish boy; that is to say, I told\nhis guardians on the next opportunity.\n\nBut to break away at once from all these trifling matters, only one day\ncame to pass before I went for Bardie. All along the sea-coast I was\ngoing very sadly; half in hopes, but more in fear, because I had bad\nnews of her. What little they could tell at Newton was that Delushy was\nalmost dead, by means of a dreadful whooping-cough, all throughout the\nwinter, and the small caliber of her throat. And Charles Morgan had no\nmore knowledge of my warm feeling thitherway, than to show me that he\nhad been keeping some boards of sawn and seasoned elm, two feet six in\nlength, and in breadth ten inches, from what he had heard about her\nhealth, and the likelihood of her measurement. When I heard this, you\nmight knock me down, in spite of all my uniform, with a tube of\nmacaroni. People have a foolish habit, when a man comes home again, of\nkeeping all the bad news from him, and pushing forward all the good. If\nthis had not been done to me, I never could have slept a wink, ere going\nto Sker Manor.\n\nTo me that old house always seemed even more desolate and forlorn with\nthe summer sunshine on it, than in the fogs and storms of winter;\nperhaps from the bareness of the sandhills, and the rocks, and\ndry-stone walls, showing more in the brightness, and when woods and\nbanks are fairest. I looked in vain for a moving creature; there seemed\nto be none for miles around, except a sullen cormorant sleeping far away\nat sea. Only little Dutch was howling in some lonely corner slowly, as\nwhen her five young masters died.\n\nAs I approached the door in fear of being too late to say good-bye to my\npretty little one, yet trying to think how well it might be for her poor\nyoung life to flutter to some guardian angel, my old enemy Black Evan\nstood and barred the way for me. I doubt if he knew me, at first sight;\nand beyond any doubt at all, I never should have known him, if I had\nchanced to meet him elsewhere. For I had not set eyes on his face from\nthe day when he frightened us so at the Inquest; and in those ten\nmonths, what a change from rugged strength to decrepitude!\n\n\"You cannot see any one in this house,\" he said very quietly, and of\ncourse in Welsh; \"every one is very busy, and in great trouble every\none.\"\n\n\"Evan Black, I feel sorrow for you. And have felt it, through all your\ntroubles. Take the hand of a man who has come with goodwill, and to help\nyou.\"\n\nHe put out his hand, and its horn was gone. I found it flabby, cold, and\ntrembling. A year ago he had been famous for crushing everything in his\npalm.\n\n\"You cannot help us; neither can any man born of a woman,\" he answered,\nwith his black eyes big with tears: \"it is the will of the Lord to slay\nall whom He findeth dear to me.\"\n\n\"Is Delushy dead?\" I asked, with a great sob rising in my throat, like\nwadding rammed by an untaught man.\n\n\"The little sweetheart is not yet dead; but she cannot live beyond the\nday. She lies panting with lips open. What food has she taken for five\ndays?\"\n\nAny one whose nature leads him to be moved by little things, would have\nbeen distressed at seeing such a most unlucky creature finishing her\ntender days in that quiet childish manner, among strangers' tenderness.\nIn her weak, defeated state, with all her clever notions gone, she lay\nwith a piece of striped flannel round her, the lips, that used to\nprattle so, now gasping for another breath, and the little toes that\ndanced so, limp, and frail, and feebly twitching. The tiny frame was too\nworn to cough, and could only shudder faintly, when the fit came through\nit. Yet I could see that the dear little eyes looked at me, and tried to\nsay to the wandering wits that it was Old Davy; and the helpless tongue\nmade effort to express that love of beauty, which had ever seemed to be\nthe ruling baby passion. The crown and stripes upon my right arm were\ndone in gold--at my own expense, for Government only allowed yellow\nthread. Upon these her dim eyes fastened, with a pleasure of surprise;\nand though she could not manage it, she tried to say, \"How boofely!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nTHE LITTLE MAID, AND THE MIDSHIPMAN.\n\n\nIn this sad predicament, I looked from one to other of them, hoping for\nsome counsel. There was Moxy, crying quite as if it were her own child\nalmost; and there was Peggy the milking-maid, allowed to offer her\nopinion (having had a child, although not authorised to produce one);\nalso myself in uniform, and Black Evan coming up softly, with a\nnewly-discovered walk. And yet not one had a word to say except \"poor\nlittle dear!\" sometimes; and sometimes, \"we must trust in God.\"\n\n\"I tell you,\" I cried; \"that never does. And I never knew good come of\nit. A man's first place is to trust to himself, and to pray to the Lord\nto help him. Have you nothing more to say?\"\n\n\"Here be all her little things,\" Black Evan whispered to his wife; \"put\nthem ready to go with her.\" His two great hands were full of little odds\nand ends which she had gathered in her lonely play along the beach, and\non the sandhills.\n\n\"Is that all that you can do? Watkin could do more than that. And now\nwhere is young Watkin?\"\n\nThey assured me there was no more to do. They were tired of trying\neverything. As for Watkin, he it was who had brought the malady into the\nhouse, and now they had sent him for change of air to an uncle he had at\nLlynvi. Concerning Delushy, there was nothing for her to do, but to die,\nand to go to heaven.\n\n\"She shan't die, I tell you,\" I cried out strongly: \"you are a set of\nhopeless ones. Twice have I saved her life before, when I was only a\nfisherman. I am a man in authority now; and please God, I am just in\ntime to save her life, once more, my friends. Do you give her up, you\nstupids?\"\n\nThey plainly thought that I was gone mad, by reason of my rise in life;\nand tenfold sure of it they were, when I called for a gown of red\nPembrokeshire flannel, belonging to Moxy for ten years now. However poor\nMoxy herself went for it; and I took the child out of her stuffy bed,\nand the hot close room containing it, and bore her gently in my arms\nwith the red flannel round her, and was shocked to find how light she\nwas. Down the great staircase I took her, and then feeling her breath\nstill going, and even a stir of her toes, as if the life was coming back\nto her, what did I do but go out of doors, into the bright May sunshine?\nI held her uncommon and clearly-shaped face on my bosom, to front the\nsunlight, and her long eyelashes lifted, and her small breast gave three\nsighs.\n\n\"Good-bye all of you,\" I cried: \"she comes away with me this minute.\nPeggy may come, if she likes, with half a sheep on her back to-morrow.\"\n\nAnd so she did: and I could not give her less than half-a-crown for it;\nbecause of the difference and the grace of God to darling Bardie. In my\narms the whole way home, she lay like a new-born lamb almost, with her\nbreath overcome at first, and heavily drawn, while her eyes were waking.\nThen as the air of the open heaven found its way to her worn-out lungs,\ndown her quiet eyelids dropped, with a sleepy sense of happiness, and\nher weak lips dreamed of smiling, and her infant breast began to rise\nand fall quite steadily. And so she fell into a great deep sleep, and so\nI took her to my home, and the air of Newton saved her.\n\nOur Bunny was very good. There could hardly have been any better child,\nwhen her victuals were not invaded. She entered into Bardie's condition,\nand took quite a motherly attitude towards her. And while the tiny one\nlay so weak, Bunny felt that the lead of mind was hers for the present,\nand might be established by a vigorous policy. However in this point she\nwas wrong, or at any rate failed to work it out. In a fortnight Bardie\nwas mistress again; and poor Bunny had to trot after her.\n\nNow although it was very pleasant to see the thankfulness of Black Evan,\nwhen he came over every day, and brought his pockets full of things, and\ntried to look pleased when truthful Bardie refused downright to kiss\nhim; pleasant also for me to be begged not only to fish, but even to\nshoot--perhaps because now the wrong time of year--in and over and\nthrough a place, where the mere sight of my hat had been sure to lead to\na black eye under it; in despite of all these pleasures, I perceived\nthat business must be thoroughly attended to. And taking this view I was\nstrengthened in my own opinions, by the concurrence of every neighbour\npossessing a particle of sense. Not only Mother Jones--who might be\nhard, from so much family--but also the landlord of the Jolly quite\nagreed with the landlady, and even Crumpy, a man of the utmost\ntenderness ever known almost, and who must admire children, because he\nnever yet had owned any--all these authorities agreed that I must take\ncare what I was about. For my part, finding their opinions go beyond my\nown almost, or at any rate take a form of words different from my own,\nand having no assurance how it might end, I felt inclined to go back,\nand give fair-play to both sides of the argument.\n\nBut, as often happens when a man desires to see the right, and act\nstrictly up to it, the whole affair was interrupted, and my attention\ncalled away by another important matter, and the duties springing out of\nit. And this came to pass in the following manner. It happened upon\nOak-apple morning that I was down on a little sandhill, smoking a\npipe, and with both children building houses upon my pumps. These pumps\nhad lovely buckles of the very latest regulation; and it was a pleasure\nto regard them when at leisure, and reflect upon their quality, as well\nas signification. The children, however, took this matter from another\npoint of view; and there was scarcely anything to their little minds\nmore delightful than to obscure my pumps with sand, and put up a tower\nover them. And then if I moved, down came the whole; and instead of\nthemselves, they laughed at me. I had worked very hard in the Alcestis,\nand for almost a week after landing found it a most delicious thing,\nbecause so incomprehensible, to have nothing whatever to do. But long\nbefore now, I was tired of it, and yearned to put on my old slops again,\nand have a long day of fishing as if Bunny's life and mine hung on it.\nAnd when I gave a feast of turbot caught by that excellent Sandy Macraw\n(and paid for at just what he chose to charge), you would not have\nguessed it, but such were my feelings, that I only could make believe to\neat. And Sandy himself, by special desire, took the foot of the table,\nand went largely into everything; but behaved uncommonly well, for him.\n\nNow this is just the way I keep on going out of the proper track. If I\ncould not train a gun, much straighter than I can tell a story, France\nwould have conquered England, I believe, in spite of Nelson. It is the\nexcess of windage, coming down to me from great bards, which prevents my\nshot from flying point-blank, as it ought to do. Nevertheless the\nvillage children loved my style, especially since his Majesty had\nembellished me. And this was why I shunned the well, and sate among the\nsandhills; for really it was too hard to be expected to have in throat\na new story, never heard before, every time a little pitcher came on the\nhead of a little maid, to be filled, and then to go off again. Bardie\nand Bunny knew better than that, and never came for stories, till the\nproper time--the twilight.\n\nNow, as I was longing much to sacrifice all dignity, and throw off\ngold-lace and blue-cloth, and verily go at the congers (which I did the\nnext day, and defied the parish to think what it chose of me), I beheld\na pair of horses, with a carriage after them, coming in a lively manner\ntowards my nest of refuge.\n\n\"It is useless now,\" I cried aloud; \"I can hope for no more peace.\nEverybody knows me, or believes it right to know me.\"\n\nNevertheless, on the whole, I felt pleased, when I saw that the harness\nwas very bright, and the running-gear knopped with silver. And my\namazement was what you may enter into, when really the driver proved to\nbe no bigger than that little Master Rodney Bluett. He had the proper\ncoachman by his side, for fear of accidents; but to me, who had seen so\nmuch of horses now in Devonshire, it appeared a most rash thing to allow\nsuch a boy to navigate.\n\nHowever, having caught me thus, he jumped out without accident, while\nthe coachman touched his hat to me, or to his Majesty as now represented\nby me.\n\nThen that noble boy--as he ought no doubt to be entitled, being the son\nof a nobleman, although in common parlance styled an honourable boy,\nwhich to my mind is no more than a simple contradiction--up he ran with\nhis usual haste, expecting to find only Bunny and me. But his\nastonishment was worth seeing, on account of his being such a fair young\nchap, when suddenly he beheld poor Bardie, standing weakly on her legs\nnot quite re-established yet, and in her shy manner of inner doctrine\ntaking observation of him. A more free-and-easy schoolboy there could\nscarcely be than Rodney; and as for our Bunny, he used to toss her,\nuntil her weight overpowered him. But with this little lady looking so\npale, and drawn, and delicate, he knew (as if by instinct) that he must\nbegin very gingerly.\n\n\"Captain Llewellyn,\" he said; \"I am come to tell you that my mind is\nquite made up. I mean to go to sea as soon as I can have my clothes\nmade.\"\n\n\"But, young sir,\" I answered, with a wish to humour this fine boy, yet a\ndesire to escape the noble Colonel's anger; \"it is useless now to go to\nsea. There is no war. We must wait, and trust the Lord to send one.\"\n\n\"And how shall I be fit to manage a ship, and fight our enemies, unless\nI begin at once, and practise, Captain Llewellyn?\"\n\nIn this there was so much truth, as well as sense of discipline,\nmoreover such fine power of hope for another good bout at the French,\nthat I looked at my pocket-lappets for an answer; and found none.\n\n\"I can stand a great deal,\" he cried; \"on account of my age, and so on.\nBut I can't stand Latin and Greek, and I cannot stand being put off\nalways. I know what they want me to do. They want me to grow too old for\nthe Navy! And I do believe they will manage it. I am getting twelve,\nevery day almost, and I can pull a pair of oars, and fire a cannon nine\ninches long, and sail a boat, if it doesn't blow.\"\n\n\"For all that I can answer, sir,\" my words were, being proud of him;\n\"and you know who taught you this, and that. And you know that he always\ndid impress upon your early mind the necessity of stern discipline, and\nobedience to superiors. Your first duty is to your King and country, in\nthe glorious time of war. But with a wretched peace prevailing, your\nduty is to the powers placed by Providence to look after you.\"\n\n\"I have heard that till I am sick of it,\" he answered rather rudely, for\nI seemed to myself to have put it well: \"is that all you can do for me?\nI had better not have come at all. Look, I have five guineas here, given\nme yesterday, and all good ones. I will put them just in there--and my\nword of honour----\"\n\n\"My boy, if it were fifty, five hundred, or five thousand, would an\nofficer of the Royal Navy think of listening to them? You have hurt my\nsense of honour.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Captain Llewellyn,\" he said, hanging down his head:\n\"but you used not to be quite so proud. You used to like five shillings\neven.\"\n\n\"That is neither here nor there,\" I answered very loftily, and\nincreasing his confusion: \"five shillings honourably earned no man need\nbe ashamed of. But what you have offered me is a bribe, for the low\npurpose of cheating your good uncle and dear mother. You ought to sink\ninto the sand, sir.\"\n\nHe seemed pretty nearly fit to do so, for I put a stern face on, though\nall the time I could hardly keep from laughing most good-naturedly; when\na little hand went into his, and a little face defied me. Poor sick\nBardie had watched every word, and though unable to understand, she took\nhot sides with the weaker one.\n\n\"'E san't sink into 'e sand, I tell 'a, 'e yicked bad old Davy. 'Hot's a\ndone to be 'colded so? I's very angy with 'a indeed, to go on so to a\ngentleyum.\"\n\nBy what instinct could she tell that this was a young gentleman? By the\nsame, I suppose, by which he knew that she was a young lady. And each of\nthem ready to stand up for the other immediately! It made me laugh: and\nyet it is a sad thing to go into.\n\n\"Now, my boy,\" I began for fear of losing the upper hand of them; \"you\nare old enough to understand good sense when put before you. It is true\nenough that if you mean to walk the planks like a sailor, you can hardly\nbegin too soon at the time of life you are come to. I was afloat at\nhalf your age, so far as I can remember. But I am bound to lay before\nyou two very serious questions. You will have to meet, and never escape\nfrom, every kind of dirt, and hardship, narrowness, and\nhalf-starving--not an atom of comfort left, such as you are accustomed\nto. Danger I will not speak of, because it would only lead you on to it.\nBut the other thing is this: By going to sea, you will for ever grieve\nand drive out of your prospects not only your good uncle, but perhaps\nalmost your mother.\"\n\nI thought I had made a most excellent speech, and Bardie looked up with\nadmiration, to know when I meant to finish. But to my surprise, young\nRodney took very little heed of it.\n\n\"That shows how much you know, old Davy! Why I was come on purpose to\ntell you that they are tired out at last: and that I may go to sea, if\nonly you will appoint me a place on board of your ship Alcestis. Now do,\nCaptain Llewellyn, do, and I will never forgot it to you, if ever I\nbecome a great man.\"\n\n\"My dear boy, I would do it this minute if I had the power. But though\nthey call me 'Captain' here, I am only Captain of a gun, and Instructor\nof Artillery. And even our Captain himself could not do it. He could\nonly take you as a volunteer, and now there is no call for them. You\nmust get your appointment as midshipman in the regular way from London.\nAnd the chances are fifty to one against your joining the Alcestis. That\nis to say, of course, unless you have some special interest.\"\n\nHis countenance fell to the lowest ebb, and great tears stood in his\nbold blue eyes; but presently the hopeful spirit of youth and brave\nlineage returned.\n\n\"I will write to my brother in London,\" he said; \"he has never done me a\ngood turn yet; perhaps he will begin this time.\"\n\nNot to be too long about it, either by that or some other influence, he\nobtained his heart's desire, and was appointed midshipman, with orders\nto join the Alcestis, upon her next appearance off our coast. You should\nhave seen the fuss he made, and his mother too, about his outfit; and\neven Colonel Lougher could not help being much excited. As for me, I was\nforced to go to and fro betwixt Newton and Candleston Court every day,\nand twice a-day, for the purpose of delivering judgment upon every box\nthat came. But when Master Rodney made me toss his spelling-books and\ngrammar at his breast, to practise parrying with his little dirk, I\nbegged him to let me take them home, as soon as he was tired. I have\nthem now with his little stabs in them, and they make me almost\nindependent of the schoolmaster in writing.\n\nNot only was I treated so that I need not have bought any food at\nall--except for Bardie and Bunny--but also employed at a pleasant price\nto deliver lessons every morning as to the names of sails and ropes and\nthe proper style of handling them. We used to walk down to the hard\nsea-shore, with a couple of sharp sticks, whenever the tide allowed fair\ndrawing-room. And the two little children enjoyed it almost as much as\nthe rising hero did. The difficulty was to keep the village children,\nwho paid nothing, from taking the benefit of my lecture as much as\nMidshipman Bluett did. And they might have done so, if they cared to do\nit, for I like a good large audience; but they always went into playing\nhopscotch, in among my ropes and yards, when all done beautifully in\nfine sand, and ready to begin almost--for the proper way is to have a\nship spread naked first, and then hoist sail, if you want to show its\nmeaning. I could not bear to be hard upon these young ones--and some of\nthem good Mother Jones's own--all in a mess of activity; and I tried to\nthink that it was all right, because money was earning anyhow. But I\ncould not reconcile it with my sense of duty to make a game of well-paid\nwork; therefore I kept the children out, in a manner I need not now\ndescribe, only you may rely upon it for real ingenuity; for children are\nworse to manage than folk who have been through having them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nA FINE PRICE FOR BARDIE.\n\n\nNow our own two little darlings had behaved so beautifully, gazing at\nthe bad works of the others from a distance only, though sadly pushed to\nshare in them, and keeping their little garters up, when the others were\nhopscotching; also feeling, and pointing out, and almost exaggerating\nthe ruin wrought by the other small ones (which they durst not come down\nto help), that I determined to give them both a magnificent Sunday\ndinner. I would gladly have had the young midshipman down--for on Sunday\nhe was such an ornament, as good as the best church-window!--but now our\ntime was almost up; and though his mother would have let him come to\ngrace my humble cottage, the Colonel insisted that he must go to take\nfarewell of some excellent aunts, from whom he had large expectations,\nand who had ordered him up for the Sunday to the neighbourhood of\nCardiff. However, we could get on very well with our own aristocracy\nonly, which I was sure poor Bardie was, though without any aunts to dine\nher, and it only made me the more determined to have a family party fed\non good fare. We envied nobody as we sate down, and the little ones put\nup both hands, according to some ancient teaching. For the first course,\nwe had conger, baked; a most nourishing, excellent dish, full of jelly\nand things for children. And this one was stuffed, like a loaded cannon,\nwith meat-balls, pork fat, and carraways. Bunny went at him as if she\nhad never secured such a chance in her life before, but Bardie seemed\ninclined to wait for what was coming afterwards, and spent the time in\nwatching Bunny with admiration and contempt mixed, as they are on a\nchild's face only.\n\nThen I brought in the dish of the day, with Bunny skipping and going\nabout, and scorching her fingers to help me; but Bardie (having gone\ninto her grandeur) sitting at table steadfastly, and with a resolute\nmind to know what it was before approval. She had the most delicate\nnostrils, but what I brought made her open them. Because I had the very\nbest half of the very best ham ever cured in our parish, through a whole\nseries of good-luck. Luck, and skill, and the will of the Lord, must all\ncombine for a first-rate ham; and here they were met, and no mistake,\nboth by one another and by excellent cooking afterwards. It would not\nbecome me to say any more, when it comes to my mind that the delicate\ngold of infant cabbage, by side of it, was also of my own planting, in a\nbit of black mould in a choice niche, ere Bethel Jose had tempted me. In\nspite of all this wonderful cheer, and the little ones going on\nfamously, the sight of that young cabbage struck a vein of sorrow in me\nsomewhere. To go away, and leave my house and garden for whole years\nperhaps, and feel that it was all behind me, in neglect and loneliness,\nwith no one to undo the windows, or to sow a row of peas, or even dib a\ncabbage in, and perhaps myself to find no chance of coming back to it,\nand none to feel the difference! Like a knife all this went through me;\nso that I must look upward quite, for fear of the little ones watching\nme.\n\nThose two little creatures ate with a power and a heartiness enough to\nmake anybody rejoice in the harmless glory of feeding them. After the\nvery first taste, they never stopped to wipe their lips, or to consider\nanything, but dealt with what they had won, and felt, and thoroughly\nentered into it. Only every now and then they could not help admiring\nwhat I take to be the surest proof of a fine ham and good cookery; that\nis to say, bright stripes of scarlet in between fat of a clear French\nwhite, not unlike our streaky jaspers interlaid with agate. To see that\nlittle thing, who scarce could lift a finger three weeks ago, now\nplaying so brisk a knife and fork, filled me with gratitude and joy, so\nthat I made up my mind to finish my dinner from the conger, and keep the\nrest of the ham for her.\n\nI gave the little souls their wine--as they called it--of\ngooseberry-water, a good egg-cup full apiece; and away they went, like\ntwo little women, into the garden to play with it, and see who would\nkeep it the longest. Then I put the rest of the ham in the cupboard, and\nreturning to the conger, began to enjoy the carver's privilege of ten\nminutes for his own fork. But just as I had done handsomely well, and\nwas now preparing to think about a pipe of fine Navy tobacco, and a\nsmall nip of old rum and water, suddenly my door was darkened, and there\nstood the very last man (save one) whom, for my comfort and calm Sabbath\nfeeling, I could ever have wished to see.\n\n\"Peace be to this house,\" he began, with his hands spread out, and his\neyes turned up, but his nostrils taking sniff of things: \"peace be to\nthis humble home, and the perishing flesh contained in it! Brother Davy,\nis it well with thee?\"\n\n\"Brother Hezekiah,\" said I, perceiving what he was up to: \"no flesh does\nthis house contain; for that it is too humble. But in the name of the\nLord, right welcome art thou to cold conger! Brother, I pray thee, arise\nand eat; and go forty days hence on the strength of it.\"\n\n\"It hath been done,\" replied Hezekiah, \"by Divine grace and unceasing\nprayer. But come, old chap, I am sure you have got something better in\nthat cupboard. Stinking fish hast thou often sold me, and lo I have\nstriven to like it! therefore give me good meat now, and let us rejoice\nat thy great doings.\"\n\nThis speech was so full of truth that it got the upper hand of me, both\nby the sense of compunction and the strength of hospitality, and I could\nno longer deny to Perkins all that remained of poor Bardie's ham. \"I\nhave expounded the word of the Lord, I have been as Lot in your little\nZoar,\" he cried, going on for the third help of ham; \"my spirit was\nmighty within me, David; and Hepzibah took up the wondrous tale.\nBacksliding brother, where hast thou been? There is a movement and\nrevival set afoot from my burning words and Hepzibah's prophecies such\nas shall make your rotten old Church----\"\n\n\"Have a drop of beer,\" I said, for I did not like to see him shake his\nfist at our church-tower.\n\n\"Well, I don't mind if I do,\" he answered, \"now I come to think of it.\nEverything in its season, brother. And a drop of your old rum\nafterwards.\"\n\nI pretended not to hear this last; for though I might stand him in\ntwopenny ale, I saw no reason for spoiling the tops of a bottle or two\nthat I scorned to open, even when my rheumatics had leapt from my double\nhalf-ribs to my ear-drops. So, after observing that things were locked\nup, I ran into the Jolly, and fetched a pint of small ale, very rapidly.\nNot expecting me back so soon, he had made a good round, with his knife\nin his hand, to see what might be hoped for. Now back he came with a\ngroan, and said that he knew not what he was fit for. When the power of\nthe Word came upon him, he had such spasms afterwards.\n\nI never love to be in company with a man of this sort. When my time is\ncome for thanking God for a fine dinner, I would rather be alongside of\na simple man and a stupid one, who can sit and think with me, and say no\nmore about it. He knew my feelings, I do believe, and enjoyed them like\npickles with his meat; and after finishing every morsel, even down to\nthe mark of the saw upon the very knuck of it, up he put his tallowy\nthumbs with the black nails outwards, and drew a long breath, and\ndelivered, \"In the name of the Lord, Amen. And now, Brother David,\nrejoice a little, as behoves a Christian man, upon the blessed\nSabbath-day.\"\n\n\"Hezekiah, I have rejoiced to behold your joy in feeding, and to\nminister thereto. Now, having fruition of fleshly things, take the word\nof the Lord, oh my brother, and expound doctrinally; though it be but a\nscore of chapters. I will smoke, and hearken thee.\"\n\n\"Strong meat is not for babes, my son; and a babe art thou, old Dyo.\nChaps like you must wait and watch for the times of edification. There\nis a time for sowing, and there is a time for reaping. Small ale is not\nmeat for such as bear the burden of the day.\"\n\n\"'Kiah, the smith,\" I asked, very shortly, \"what is it you would have of\nme?\"\n\n\"Brother Davy, I have offered a blessing on thy flesh-pots; and good\nthey were, though not manifold. It is comely that I should offer another\nblessing on thy vessels, Davy.\"\n\nWhat could I do with such a man in my own house? Brother Hezekiah\nbecame, at my expense, most hospitable. I found no escape from my own\nbottle, without being rude to my visitor's glass; and yet I enjoyed not\na single drop, for want of real companionship. For all my wits were up\nin arms, as if against Parson Chowne almost; because I knew that Master\nPerkins wanted to make a fool of me. So I feigned to be half-seas-over,\nthat he might think he had done it.\n\n\"Ancient friend,\" he began at last, when he thought that I was ripe for\nit; \"thou hast lifted me above the height of edification. Peradventure I\nsay words that savour not of wisdom, beloved brother, the fault is\nthine: here I am, and there you are.\"\n\n\"How can any man having a smithy of his own go on so? An thou wert not\ntipsy, 'Kiah, thou couldst see the contrary. I am here, and thou art\nthere.\"\n\n\"Just so. You have put it wonderfully,\" he answered, after thinking: \"we\nmay both say right is right, which is the end of everything. Keziah said\nto me, 'Go seek where he is, and how he is; because I have seen noble\nvisions of his exaltation.' And yet, you see, exalted brother, scarce\nthe tenth part came to her.\"\n\n\"She knows what she is about,\" said I; \"she dreamed of a red-hot cradle,\nand the hoof of Satan rocking me. Now I see the whole of it. It was\nParson Chowne, and the ferry-boat, and the ketch I was all but burned\nin. Perkins, tell me more, my friend. I have groaned much for neglecting\nthe warning of the prophetess.\"\n\n\"How many men have groaned in vain for that same cause, old Dyo!\nVainglorious males, they doubt her gift, because she is a female! Out of\nthe mouths of babes and women--brother, I forget the passage, but it\ncomes to that, I think. And now she hath been again in trouble.\"\n\n\"Concerning what, old Hezekiah? As concerning what, I pray thee?\"\n\n\"Even touching the child Delushy, in the godless house of Sker. In a\nholy trance it hath been vouchsafed her to behold that poor kid of the\nflock bearing in her mouth a paper, whereupon in letters of blood was\nwritten, 'Come over, and help us.' And we have found a way to help her,\nwith thy faithful testimony.\"\n\nIn his crafty sheep's-eyed manner, made of crawling piety mixed with\nsharp and spiteful worldliness, he began to feel my soundings towards a\nscheme so low and infamous, that my blood within me boiled for being\nforced to bear with him. He had prepared the whole plot well, and what\nit came to was just this: Inland there lived a wealthy smelter of the\nMethodist tribe, and Hezekiah was deep in his books for long supply of\nmaterial. Rees ap Rees was his name, and he longed, as every year he\ngrew older, to make up for an ancient wrong, which was coming home to\nhim. In the early days when he was poor, and clever, and ambitious, he\nhad ousted his elder brother from his father's hearth, and banished him.\nThis poor fellow fled to the colonies; and for many years no token and\nno news came home of him. Meanwhile Rees ap Rees was growing elderly,\nand worn out with money, which is a frightful thing to feel. But about a\nyear ago, a half-cast sailor had come to his house, bringing a wretched\ndeath-scrawl from this supplanted, but never yet forgotten, and only\nbrother. There were not a dozen lines, but they told a tale that made\nthe rich man weep and eat dry bread for days and days. His brother\nhaving been born without the art of getting on at all, was dying for\nwant of food and comfort, having spent his last penny to keep the mouths\nof his two little babes at work. These poor children had lost their\nmother, and were losing their father now, who with his last breath\nalmost, forgetting wrongs, as we do in death, very humbly committed them\nto the charge of his rich brother. And he said that his only remaining\nfriend, captain of the Nova Scotia, had promised to deliver them safe in\nBristol, to be sent for. The dying father had no strength to speak of\ntheir names, or age, or any other particulars.\n\nNow it so happened that Rees ap Rees was dearly fond of children, as all\nrich childless people are, on account of being denied them: and since\nhis wife died, he had often thought of adopting some one. But being\nrich, he was fidgety now; and none of the children in his neighbourhood\never blew their noses. So here he found, as it were from heaven, two\nlittle dears coming down upon him, his next of kin and right heirs, and\nalso enabling him to go to his parish churchyard, with a sense of duty\ndone, although preferring to rest elsewhere, if by law allowable. You\nmay suppose how he waited and watched; but those two little dears never\ncame. Upon that he longed for them so much more that he offered a reward\nof \u00c2\u00a3100 for any tidings of them, and of \u00c2\u00a3200 for both or either, brought\nto his house in safety. Hence it will be clear enough what Hezekiah's\nscheme was; and half the reward was to be my own.\n\n\"All thou hast to say, good Dyo, is what thou saidest at the very time;\nthat the ship was not called Andalusia, but to the best of thy belief\nwas more like Nova Scotia. Also that she was bound for Bristol, and that\nthe other baby's clothes bore no coronet, as they fancied, but the\nletter R. done fancifully, as might be by a freemason, such as the poor\nfather was said to be. That garment must be destroyed of course. I have\none prepared for the child Delushy, with 'Martha ap Rees' in faint\nwriting upon it. This the old man must find out for himself, after our\noverlooking it. He will then believe it tenfold. And after the sight of\nthy uniform, Dyo----ha! how sayest thou, old friend? A snug little sum\nto invest for old age. Thou knowest the old saying, 'Scurvy in the Navy;\nbut the Navy's self more scurvy!' When thou art discharged with three\nhalfpence a-day, one hundred pound with accumulations, say \u00c2\u00a3150 then,\nwill help to buy sulphur for thy rheumatics. Myself will give thee ten\nper cent for it, upon sound security.\"\n\n\"It sounds very well,\" said I, to lead him; \"one hundred and fifty\npounds have a fine sound.\"\n\n\"Not only that, my noble boy: but the hold thou wilt have on a rich\nyoung maiden, such as Martha ap Rees will be. The old fellow can't last\nvery long: none of those smelters ever do, and he hath heart-disease as\nwell. Little Martha will come into \u00c2\u00a320,000 or more, and every penny of\nit hanging upon thee, and me, my lad. Is it well devised, is it grand,\nmy boy; is it worthy of old 'Kiah?\"\n\n\"That it is,\" I cried; \"most worthy!\"\n\nHe flourished his glass in the pride of his heart, and even began to\nsing a song with a chorus of \"Spankadilloes,\" forgetting whose holy day\nit was. Unfortunately I did the same; for my nature can never resist a\nsong: moreover I wanted to think a little. Not from any desire to dwell\nfor a moment on my own interest, but from the great temptation to make\nthe fortunes of our poor castaway. But while I was nursing my left\nknee, with the foot giving time for another chorus (which was just\nbeginning), I heard a tiny pipe, and turned round, and there was the\nlittle thing herself, dancing on one foot, and jerking the other in\nmockery of my attitude, nodding her head to keep time as well, and for\nher very life singing out, \"Pankydillo, dillo, dillo,\" while Bunny\npeeping round the door-post, with a power of Sabbath feeling, looked as\nif the world were ending. It was clear that Bardie had not seen Perkins,\nwhom she never could endure, else would she not have run in from the\ngarden, to bear a share in our melody; and that good brother was so full\nof his noble scheme, and his song, and my rum, that he never noticed her\nbaby voice; and her quick light figure was out of his sight, from the\ncorner of his boozing. Therefore I managed to get her away, and send her\nfor a good walk with Bunny, to look for water-cress at Bruwys Well; for\nI thought it wiser to keep that Perkins ignorant of her whereabouts; and\nBunny could be trusted now to see to any one anywhere.\n\nOff went the heavy one very gravely, and the light one full of antics,\neven in front of the cottages singing \"Pankydillo\" (which hit her\nfancy), so that I feared some disrepute, at such a thing going forth\nfrom our house upon a Sabbath evening. I tried to frown, but she made me\nlaugh by turning round and clapping her knee, exactly as she had seen me\ndo; and it seemed the best thing to go back out of sight, ere neighbours\ngot the key to it. Little she guessed that the fate of her life was\ndancing in the balance, and that her own lightsome play had turned it,\nwhether for good or evil.\n\nHow could I let such a spring of life, such a mischievous innocence, and\nthoroughly earnest devotion to play, sink and be quenched by a formal\nold Methodist in the iron district? Sker House was dull enough for dry\nbones: but there at least she had the sands, and sea, and shells, and\nrabbits, and wild-fowl: nor any one to terrify her with religious\nterrors--which to the young are worst of all--unless it were a ghost or\ntwo of wicked abbots repenting. Whereas I knew what an old compunctious\nMethodist is, who has made some money, and devotes his last years to\n\"the service of Jehovah.\" Even \u00c2\u00a320,000 could not make it up to her.\n\nTherefore I shook Master Perkins up, for he really had been a little too\nfree, and was going to sleep with his spectacles stuck for a corkscrew\ninto another bottle, and I made him understand that his plan was a great\ndeal too crooked for me, and that the sooner he went to seek Hepzibah\n(who was prophesying on a stool for pickling pork, down at Betsy\nMatthew's), and to prepare for his midnight service, with a strong\nRevival rising, the better chance he would have of escaping my now\nrapidly-growing desire to afford him total immersion (which is the only\nsalvation of one highly respectable lot of them) in the well of John the\nBaptist. Hezekiah dreaded water so much that this hint was enough for\nhim; and off he set in a tipsy shamble, to lie down on the sandhills,\nere he came face to face with the prophetess. When I had put things a\nlittle aright, and brushed up the hearth to a bit of fire (to warm the\nmilk for the little ones), and by opening doors and windows sweetened\nall the place with summer flowing in and nestling round the relics of\nthe sunset, and when the neighbours' chairs (whereon the very old men\nhad been sitting for their Sunday evening) creaked, as if carried in and\ndusted for another Sunday, and there was not one child left (except a\nbad child by the well, whose loose mind was astray with stars, and took\nno heed of supper-time), then the two best children in the village,\nneighbourhood, or county, hand-in-hand came to my door. They were\nwonderfully silent, and they stole (each in her own manner) just a\nlittle glimpse at me, to feel how my temper lay; then they looked at one\nanother, to exchange opinions on that all-important matter. They knew\nthey had been out too late, and had frightened Granny a little perhaps,\nand therefore now had angered him. And in their simple way, they thought\nit wiser not to broach the question. I meant to scold them, but could\nnot find it, when I beheld their pretty ways, within my power to do so.\nAnd lucky for them that I did not know, until next day, when too late to\nscold, what a dreadful mess their clothes were in. In that light I could\nonly see their pretty faces glowing, and their bright eyes full of\ndoubt, and their little bodies shrinking back. Also bundles of\nwater-cress put forward to mitigate righteous wrath. I felt that I had\nbeen having my spree, and these small creatures had only had theirs. So\nI kissed them both, and gave them good supper, and blessed them into\ntheir little bed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nPROVIDES FOR EDUCATION.\n\n\nHaving before me several years of absence from home, if it should please\nthe Lord so long to spare me, I now took measures for the welfare of\nthose who would chiefly miss me. The little cottage was my own from many\ngenerations, and in a new will made by a clever man (no less than our\nnew schoolmaster), I left it to Bunny, and all my effects, except my\nboat, and the sum of ten guineas, which two items, as honour demanded,\nwere for Miss Delushy. But what is wealth without education? No more\nthan a plummet without the line. Knowing this, I provided as follows.\n\nA thoroughly fine new schoolmaster had arisen, as aforesaid, for the\npurpose of educating all our Newton children. Our good parson had\nbrought him in, not because the old one, being challenged by the village\ntailor to spell the word \"horse\" without the picture, proved his command\nof the alphabet by accomplishing it in nine different ways, all wrong\n(for that was entered to his credit, when the tailor failed to do the\nlike), but because he horsed a boy and left him there for the afternoon,\nhaving fallen asleep without thrashing him. And it shows what the public\nconfusion of mind is, that there were not three people in all the parish\nwho could help jumbling these stories together, because each of them had\na horse in it! However the poor old man had to go, and Colonel Lougher,\nhaving nothing to do with the spelling of the children, thought it so\nhard on his brother's part, that he made the old man his head gardener,\nso as to double his wages, and enable him to sleep not half, but the\nwhole of the afternoon.\n\nHis successor in the school had been sought out very diligently, and he\ncould spell almost as well as Bardie could pronounce a word. But when we\nfound that he came from a distance more than a quick man could walk in a\nday, and that he could not through all his forefathers (although they\nwere quite at his finger-ends) claim so much even as intermarriage with\nany of our third-rate families, much less with any Llewellyns, or\nHopkins, or Bevans, or even Thomases, we saw that even Parson Lougher\nhad gone a little too far for us, and not a woman in the place would let\na bedroom to that man. However we could not bolt him out of his own\nschoolroom, and there he slept, contented with a pile of slates for\nbedstead, and of copy-books for bolster and for pillow. For a week at\nleast he had no school, but he went to church and sang beautifully\n(which brought half the women over), and the children began to be such a\nplague, at home, before Monday morning, that eight or nine were sent\nback to school, as if with halters round their necks. With these he took\nso much kind trouble, that in three hours they learned more than the\nparish had learned for a generation; so much that they could not keep it\ndown when they went home for dinner. In the afternoon there were twenty\npupils, and by the end of the week three dozen. But how could they prove\nhim to their parents qualified for a bedroom?\n\nUpon the strength of my present position, and unrivalled experience, I\nfound it my duty to come to the fore, and take the command of the\nhouseholders. And knowing of course what a waste of time it is to reason\nwith anybody, I seized the bull by the horns, and offered Master Roger\nBerkrolles the occupancy of my cottage upon most liberal conditions.\n\"That is to say for rent per quarter, one sea-snail, and per annum one\ncockleshell, to preserve the title; provided nevertheless and upon this\nexpress condition that my lawful granddaughter Bunny should be fed,\nalimented, sufficiently nourished, clothed, clad, apparelled, and in\ngarments found; also taught, instructed, indoctrined, educated and\nperfected in every branch of useful knowledge by the said Roger\nBerkrolles. Item, that if a certain child of tender years known as\n'Delushy,' should at any time appear on the premises and demand\ninstruction, instruction of the highest order, and three slices of\nbread-and-butter, should be imparted to her without charge, _de die in\ndiem_.\" I objected to these \"dies,\" as being of a nasty churchyard\nsound; but Master Roger convinced me soon, and must have convinced a far\ntougher fellow, that to put our latter end out of sight and out of mind\nso, is a bad example and discouragement for the young ones, whose place\nit is to dwell on it.\n\nA man of far coarser tone of mind than mine would be required to\ndescribe Master Roger's sense of gratitude towards me. When I do a\nhandsome thing, I cannot bear to tell of it, nor even to receive the\npraise accruing from what neighbours know. \"Do it, and be done with it,\"\nin all such cases is my rule; and if Roger chose to give me an inventory\nof goods and chattels, he can bear me out in saying that I scorned to\ncall a witness in to put his name to it. Business is not my strong\npoint, and it never is with a man of largeness.\n\nThe next thing for me to see to was to get some wicked warrants quashed;\nwhich a deep ignorance of my character, and the lies of very low\nvillains, had induced some weak or vicious magistrates to issue; so that\nin the sporting season (when I might have done my best), I was forced to\ndecamp with my telescope. This has been mentioned perhaps before; but\nnot my strong resolution to face it out, as soon as ever the sense of a\nstrong position enabled me. No doubt they had meant to do their duty;\nand I forgave them altogether. There were three of them. Two names I\nquite forget. How can one think of such trifles at sea? But the third\nwas one Master Anthony Stew, who had tyrannised over me dreadfully, in\nthe times of my tribulation. Up to this man's gate I went, and rang the\ngreat bell, with my three stripes on, and a cap of fronted tapestry.\nSquire Anthony was about, somewhere on the premises, would my honour\nmind waiting while the boy went round to look for him? This maid never\nguessed how often she had told me my fish was bad, and what a shame it\nwas to make them eat it up in the kitchen, or starve; and where did I\nhope to go to? Neither did she recollect how she had as good as made me\nkiss her behind the meat-screen, when my glory began to grow for saving\nthose drowned niggers. And yet I could not be sure that she did not know\nit all, and hide it all, for the joy of boasting afterwards. I\nunderstand everything, except women.\n\nWhen I was shown into the drawing-room, and Mrs Stew with a curtsy went\nout, as if afraid to trust herself in a presence so imposing, I had a\ngreat mind to take a nip at some of the rubbish upon the table. The\nwhole of these nick-nacks could never have paid me half what this fellow\nhad cost me in fines, expenses, costs, and so on; without a bit of\nevidence from any man of character. However, I only looked at them.\n\nWhen that low Anthony Stew came in, he knew me (before I could speak\nalmost); he gave a quick glance at the table, and then without another\nword showed me out, in spite of all my uniform, to his dirty little\njustice-room. With such a man, I should think it wrong to go into\nhis ribaldry; only he said this, at last; \"Davy, thou thief, we will\nwithdraw them, because we cannot execute them; now thou art in Royal\nService. Five there are, if I remember. Does your conscience plead to\nmore?\"\n\n\"My conscience pleads to none, your Worship. Perjured scoundrels all of\nthem. Five was the number, I do believe. Alas! what may we come to?\"\n\n\"The gallows, Dyo, the gallows, thou rogue! Thou hast had some shavings.\nBut when thy turn comes, good Dyo, I will do thee a good turn, if I\ncan.\"\n\n\"Will your Worship tell me why? I never looked for anything but the\nflint-edge from your Worship.\"\n\n\"Because thou art the only rogue I never was a match for. There, go thy\nway now; go thy way; or I shall be asking thee to dinner.\"\n\n\"Nay, your Worship, God forbid! What food have I had since\nbreakfast-time?\" And so I won the last word of him.\n\nAfter this provision for my good repute, and defiance of magisterial\nscandal on behalf of Bunny, my next act was one of pure generosity\ntowards an ancient enemy. Poor Sandy Macraw had a very hard fight to\nmaintain himself and his numerous and still increasing family. Sometimes\nthey did not taste so much as a rind of bacon for months together, but\nlived on barley-bread and dog-fish, or such stuff as he could not sell,\nwith oatmeal cakes for a noble treat every other Sunday. What did I do\nbut impart to him, under document drawn by Berkrolles, that licence to\nfish off and on Sker Point which my courage had well established, with\nauthority to him and covenant by him to attack and scare all poachers;\nthe whole to be void upon my return, if so I should think proper. And\nnot only this, but I put him in funds to replace all his tackle, by\nenabling him to sell his boat. For I went so far as to lease him my own,\nat a moderate yearly rental, upon condition that he should keep her in\nthorough repair and as good as new. And for the further validity (as the\nlease said) of this agreement, two years' rent became due at once, and\nwas paid from the price of the other boat. My boat went twice as fast as\nSandy's, and was far more handy, so that this bargain was fair and\ngenerous, and did honour to all concerned.\n\nThe next and last thing, before starting, was to provide for poor Bardie\nherself. For I feared that Hezekiah, or some other unprincipled fellow,\nmight trump up a case, and get hold of her, and sell, or by other means\nturn into money my little pet, to the loss of my rights, and perhaps her\nown undoing. Resolved as I was to stop all chances of villany of that\nkind, I went direct to Colonel Lougher and to Lady Bluett. Here I made\nthe cleanest breast that ever was scooped out almost. I may declare\nthat I kept in nothing, except about painting the boat, and one or two\ninfinite trifles of that sort, which it would have been a downright\nimpertinence to dwell upon. Nevertheless Colonel Lougher said that some\nblame might attach to me in spite of all pure intentions.\n\nBut Lady Bluett said no, no. She would not hear of it for a moment. The\nonly thing that surprised her was Llewellyn's thorough unselfishness,\nand chivalrous devotion to a child who was nothing to him. She was a\nbewitching little dear; no one who saw her could doubt that; still it\nshowed a very soft side to a wonderfully gallant character, when through\nall modesty it appeared what womanly tenderness there had been. And this\nproved how entirely right her opinion had been from the very first, and\nwhat a mistake the good Colonel had made, in declining to let her even\nargue.\n\n\"My dear Eleanor, my dear Eleanor,\" cried the Colonel, with his eyes\nwide open, and his white hand spread to her; \"I am surprised to hear you\nsay so. But we cannot go into that question now. Llewellyn begged for my\nopinion. Yours, my dear (as you have proved), is of course more\nvaluable: still I thought that it was mine----\"\n\n\"To be sure it was, dear Henry. Yours is what was asked for. My rule is\nnever to interrupt you, but to listen silently.\"\n\n\"To be sure, Eleanor, to be sure! And we always agree in the end, my\ndear. But so far as I can judge at present, Llewellyn, although with the\nvery best meaning----\"\n\n\"And a display of the greatest valour. Come, Colonel, even by his own\naccount----\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear, great valour, no doubt, coupled with very sound\ndiscretion. Yet when I come to consider the whole, I really do think\nthat your hero might have entered more fully into these particulars\nabout the boat. Of course, he had no motive, and it was simply an error\nof judgment----\"\n\n\"Henry, there was no error at all. What could he do when they would not\neven listen to him about the name of the ship? If they would not listen\nabout a ship, is it likely they would listen about a boat? And a very\nsmall atom of a boat! The thing is too ridiculous.\"\n\nPerceiving a pause, I made my bow; for the very last thing I could\ndesire would be to sow a controversy between the gentleman and lady,\nwhom of all the county I esteemed the most and loved the best. And I\nknew that if I caused dissension in a pair so well united, each would\nthink the less of me, when they came to make it up together. Moreover,\nmy object was attained. Their attention was drawn to the child again:\nthe Colonel, as the nearest magistrate, was put in legal charge of her:\nI was now quit of all concealment: and Lady Bluett had promised to see\nto the poor thing's education, if ever she should need any.\n\nThis I hoped with all my heart that she would do, and quickly too. And\nindeed she was growing at such a pace after that long illness, also\ngetting so wonderfully clever about almost everything, and full of\nremarks that might never strike a grown man till he thought of them,\nthat the only way or chance I saw of taking the genius out of her, was\nto begin her education. Forgetting just now a good deal of my own, and\nbeing so full of artillery, I got Master Berkrolles to make the first\nstart, and show her the way to the alphabet. Our Bunny now could spell\n\"cat\" and \"dog,\" and could make a good shot at some other words, and\nenjoyed a laugh at children (head and shoulders over her) whenever they\nwent amiss, and she from the master's face was sure of it. But Bardie\nhad never been to school; for I thought it below her rank so much; and\nnow I contrived for our great schoolmaster to come to my cottage, and\nthere begin.\n\nIt must have made the very gravest man, ever cut from a block of wood,\nlaugh to behold Master Roger, and her. He with his natural dignity, and\nwell-founded sense of learning, and continual craving for a perfect form\nof discipline; yet unable to conceal his great wonder at her ways: she\non her side taking measure of him in a shy glance or two, and letting\nher long eyelashes fall, and crossing her feet with one shoulder towards\nhim, for him to begin with her. He vowed that he never had such a pupil;\ninstead of learning, she wanted to know the reason why of everything.\nWhy had A two legs and a girdle, while B had two stomachs and no leg at\nall? C was the moon, from the shape of it. It was no good to tell her\nthat C was the cat; a cat had four legs and C had none: and as for D\nbeing a dog, she would fetch dear Dutch, if he would not believe her,\nand show him what a dog was like. And then perceiving how patient he\nwas, and understanding his goodness, the poor little fatherless soul\njumped up on his knee, and demanded a play with him. He did not know how\nto play very well, because he was an ancient bachelor; but entering into\nher sad luck, from knowledge of her history, he did the very best thing\n(as I thought) that ever had been done to her. He put her on a stool\nbetween his knees, and through the gloss of her hair he poured such very\nbeautiful and true stories, that one could almost see her mind (like the\nbud of a primrose) opening. She pushed up her little hands and tossed\nher thick hair out of the hearing way, and then, being absorbed in some\nadventures like her own almost, round she turned and laid her eyes upon\nhis furrowed yet beaming face, and her delicate elbows on his knees, and\ndrank in every word, with sighs, and short breath, and a tear or two.\n\nAlthough, from one point of view, I did not like to be superseded so,\nespecially in my own department, as might be said, of story-telling, yet\nI put small feelings away, and all the jaundice of jealousy. If I were\nbound to go wherever Government might order me, for the safety of our\nnative land, and with moderate pay accruing, also with a high position,\nand good hopes of raising it, the least I could do was to thank the Lord\nfor sending those two poor children a man, so wise, and accomplished,\nand kind-hearted, bound over to look after them. And yet I would almost\nas lief have committed them into the hands of Mother Jones, who could\nscarcely vie with me. But they promised never to forget me; and the\nnight before I went away, I carried Bardie back to Sker, and saw that\nBlack Evan was dying.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\nINTRODUCES A REAL HERO.\n\n\nMy orders were to rejoin at Pembroke on the 10th of June, where the\nAlcestis lay refitting, and taking in stores for an ocean-cruise. Of\ncourse I was punctual to the day, and carried with me a fine recruit,\nMaster Rodney Bluett. I received not only minute directions from his\nlady-mother, but also a tidy little salary, to enable me to look after\nhim. This was a lady of noble spirit, and ready to devote her son for\nthe benefit of his country; because there was no fighting now, nor any\nwar in prospect. Also Colonel Lougher came as far as the gate, where the\ngriffins are, and patted his nephew's curly head; and said that although\nit was not quite as he himself could have wished it, he could trust the\nboy to be an honour to a loyal family, and to write home every now and\nthen, for the sake of his poor mother. For his own sake also, I think\nthe Colonel might have very truly said; because while he was talking so,\nand trying to insist on duty, as the one thing needful, I could not for\na moment trust my own eyes to examine him. So we all tried to say\n\"good-bye,\" as if there was nothing in it.\n\nIt was a very long \"good-bye,\" even longer than we could by any stretch\nhave dreamed of. Two or three years was the utmost that we then looked\nforward to: but I tell you simple truth, in saying that not one of us\nhad the chance of seeing England, much less any part of Wales, for a\nshorter period than seven years and two months added. You may doubt me,\nand say, \"Pooh, pooh! that was your fault;\" and so on. But you would be\nwholly wrong; and from the Admiralty records our Captain could prove it\nthoroughly. And what is much clearer than all, do you think that Captain\nDrake Bampfylde would have been seven years, or even seven days, away,\nwithout sight of his beautiful lady, Isabel Carey, if it could have been\nmanaged otherwise?\n\nIt was a mixture of bad luck. I can explain a good deal of it, but not\nall the ins and outs. We were ordered here, and ordered there, and then\nsometimes receiving three contradictions of everything. Until we should\nscarcely have been surprised at receiving signal, \"H.M.S. Alcestis to\nthe moon; to wait for orders.\"\n\nAnd if we had received that signal, I believe we should have tried it,\nbeing by this time the best-trained and finest ship's company in the\nworld. We had ceased to be a receiving-ship, as soon as the war was\nover, and now were what they begin to call--though it sounds against the\ngrain to me--an \"Experimental Ship.\" And the Lord knows that we made\nexperiments enough to drown, or blow up, or blow arms off, every man\nborne on our blessed books. They placed me at the head of it all, until\nthe others were up to it; and a more uneasy or ticklish time I never\nhave known, before or since. Over and over again I expected to go up to\nthe sky almost; and you may pretty well conceive how frequent was my\nuneasiness. Nevertheless I still held on; and Government had to pay for\nit.\n\nIn four years' time the old frigate began to be knocked almost to\npieces; and we made up our minds to be ordered home, and set our\nmemories at work upon all who were likely to meet us, if still in the\nland of the living. While at Halifax thinking thus, and looking forward\nto Christmas-time among our own families, a spick and span new frigate\ncame, of the loveliest lines we had ever seen, and standing-gear the\nmost elegant. She took our eyes so much at once, and she sat the water\nso, that there was not a man of us able to think of anything else till\nall hands piped down. This was the Thetis, if you please, taken from the\nCrappos in the very last action of the war, a 46-gun frigate, but larger\nthan an English 60-gun ship. The French shipbuilders are better than\nours, but their riggers not to be compared; which is the reason perhaps\nwhy they always shoot at our rigging instead of our hulls. At any rate,\nhaving been well overhauled, and thoroughly refitted at Chatham, and\nrigged anew from step to truck, she presented an appearance of most\ntempting character.\n\nIt was a trick of the Naval Board to keep us together, and it succeeded.\nThose gentlemen knew what we were by this time, the very best ship's\ncompany to be found in all the service; and as there were signs already\nof some mischief brewing, their desire was still to keep together such a\npiece of discipline. My humble name had been brought forward many times\nwith approval, but without any effect so far upon wages or position.\nNow, however, my Lords had found it expedient to remember me, and David\nLlewellyn was appointed master's mate to the Thetis, if he should think\nfit to join her; for the whole after our long service was a matter of\nvolunteering.\n\nThere was not a man of us dared to leave Captain Drake Bampfylde\nshabbily. We turned over to the Thetis, in a body, with him; and the\ncrew that had manned her from England took the old Alcestis home again.\nAnd junior Lieutenant Bluett, now a fine young fellow, walked the\nquarter-deck of the Thetis, so that you should have seen him. But first\nand foremost was to see our great Captain Drake; as ready as if he were\nalways looking out for an enemy's ship from the foretop. He walked a\nlittle lame, on account of the piece the shark took out of him;\nnevertheless we had not a man to equal him for activity. I remember once\nwhen a violent gale caught us on the banks of Newfoundland, and the sky\ncame down upon us black as any thunder-cloud. The wind grew on us so\ntowards nightfall, that after taking in reef after reef, the orders were\nto make all snug, send down the topgallant-masts, and lie-to under\nclose-reefed main-topsail and fore-topmast staysail. Captain Drake was\nhimself on deck, as he always was in time of danger, and through the\nroar of the gale his orders came as clear as a bell almost, from the\nmouth of his speaking-trumpet. \"Main-top men, to station! Close reef the\nmain-topsail. Mr Bluett, clew up, clew up. There is not a moment to\nlose, my men. Spit to your hands and stick like pitch. What! are you\nafraid then, all of you?\"\n\nFor the sail was lashing about like thunder, having broken from the\nquarter-gasket, and when the men came to the topsail-yard they durst not\ngo upon it. Then a black squall struck them with blinding rain, and they\nscarce could see one another's faces, till a cheery voice came from the\nend of the yard, \"Hold on, my lads--hold on there! You seem so skeery of\nthis job, I will do it for you.\" \"'Tis the devil himself!\" cried old Ben\nBower, captain of the main-top; \"let him fly, let him fly, my lads!\" \"It\nis our Captain,\" said I, who was coming slowly up to see to it, myself\nprepared to do the job, and shame all those young fellows; \"skulk below,\nyou jelly-pots, and leave it to me and the Captain.\" \"A cheer for the\nCaptain, a cheer for the Captain!\" they cried before I could follow\nthem, and a score of men stood against the sky, in the black pitch of\nthe hurricane, as if it were a review almost. For they guessed what the\nCaptain must have done, and it made a hero of each of them. While they\ncame slowly up the ratlins, he clomb the rigging like a cat, and before\nthey got to the lubber's hole he was at the topmasthead, whence he slid\ndown by the topping-lift to the very end of the mainyard. Such a thing\ndone in a furious gale, and the sea going mountains high almost, beat\neven my experience of what British captains are up to. After that, if he\nhad cried, \"Make sail to\"--Heligoland, with no landing to it--there was\nnot a man of us but would have touched his hat, and said, \"Ay, ay, sir!\"\n\nAnd now we first met Captain Nelson in command of the Boreas, a poor\nlittle frigate; we could have sunk her as easily as we outsailed her.\nBut as senior to Captain Drake, he at once assumed command of us;\nalthough it was not in our instructions to be at his disposal. The\nAmericans then were carrying on with the privileges of British subjects,\nin trading with the Leeward Islands; although they had cast off our\nauthority in a most uncourteous, and I might say headstrong manner.\nCaptain Nelson could never put up with the presumptuous manners of this\nrace, and he felt bitterly how feeble had been our behaviour to them.\nThese are people who will always lead the whole world, if they can;\ncounting it honour to depart from and get over old ideas. And now they\nwere doing a snug bit of roguery with the Leeward Islands, pretending\nto have British bottoms, while at bottom Yankees.\n\nNelson set his face against it; and whenever he set his face, his hand\ncame quickly afterwards. We soon cut up that bit of smuggling, although\nthe Governor of the Islands was himself against us. Captain Nelson's\norders were to enforce the Navigation Act; and we did it thoroughly.\n\nEver so many times I met him, as he now came to and fro; and he took the\nbarge-tiller out of my hand, at least a dozen times, I think. For he\nnever could bear that another man should seem to do his work for him,\nany more than he could bear to see a thing done badly. Not that he found\nfault with my steering (which was better than his own, no doubt), but\nthat he wanted to steer himself. And he never could sit a boat quietly,\nfrom his perpetual ups and downs, and longing to do something. He knew\nmy name; he knew every one's name; he called me \"old Dyo,\" continually,\nbecause the men had caught it up; and in my position, I could not\nperceive what right he had to do so. I had him on my lap, I won't say\nfifty times, but at least fifteen: for he never had sea-legs at all when\na heavy sea was running: and I never thought it any honour, but\ncherished some hopes of a shilling, or so. As for appearance, at first\nsight he struck me as rather grotesque-looking than imposing, in spite\nof his full-laced uniform, and the broad flaps of his waistcoat. His\nhair, moreover, was drawn away from his forehead, and tied in a lanky\ntail, leaving exposed, in all its force, rather a sad face, pale and\nthin, and with the nose somewhat lop-sided. Also the shoulders badly\nshaped, and the body set up anyhow; and the whole arrangement of his\nframe nervous, more than muscular.\n\nIn spite of all this, any man who knows the faces of men, and their true\nmeaning, could not fail to perceive at once that here was no common\nmortal. The vigour and spirit of his eyes were such that they not only\nseemed to be looking through whatever lay before them, but to have\ndistinct perception of a larger distance, and eagerness to deal with it.\nAnd the whole expression of his face told of powerful impatience, and a\nlonging for great deeds, dashed with melancholy. The entire crew of his\nship, I was told, were altogether wrapped up in him, and would give\ntheir lives for him without thought; and there was not one of them but\nwas mad with our Government for being at peace, and barring Captain\nNelson from the exploits he was pining for. One of them struck at me\nwith an oar, when I said how puny Nelson was, compared with our Drake\nBampfylde, and only the strong sense of my position enabled me to put up\nwith it. And what I said was all the time the very truest of the true;\nand that was why it hurt them so. We being now the finest and smartest\nfrigate in the service, looked down upon that tub of a Boreas, and her\nwaddle-footed crew, and her pale, pig-tailed commander, with a power of\nignominy which they were not pleased with. And all the time we were at\ntheir orders, and they took care to let us know it! We would have fought\nthem with pleasure, if the rules of the service allowed it.\n\nEnough of that uncomfortable discontent and soreness. The hardest point\nis for a very great man to begin to set forth his greatness. We could\nnot, at the moment, see why Horatio Nelson should thus sweep off with\nthe lead so. But after he had once established what he was, and what he\nmeant, there was no more jealousy. To this I shall come in its proper\nplace; I am only now picking up crumbs, as it were, and chewing small\njobs honourably.\n\nBut against one thing I must guard. Our Captain Drake was never for a\nmoment jealous of Captain Nelson. It was one of the things that annoyed\nus most, when we looked down on the Boreas, and would gladly have had a\ngood turn with those fellows who assumed such airs to us, to find that\nour beloved Captain was as full of Nelson as the worst of the Boreasses.\nAnd one of our men who went on strongly, took six dozen, and no mistake,\nand acknowledged how well he deserved it. That is the way to do things,\nand makes all of us one family.\n\nIt is time for me now to crowd all sail for Spithead, as we did at last.\nSeven round years and two months were gone since I had seen old Cymru,\nand I could fill seven thousand pages with our whole adventures. But\nnone of them bore much on my tale, and nobody cares for my adventures,\nsince I ceased to be young and handsome; and sometimes I almost thought\n(in spite of all experience) that I had better have gone into matrimony\nwith a young woman of moderate substance. But (as is the case with those\nthings) when I had the chance I scorned it; not being touched in the\nheart by any one, and so proud of freedom. Moreover, the competition for\na man amongst young women may become so lively as to make him bear away\nlarge down wind. Exactly what had happened to me in the land of\nDevonshire.\n\nThree quarters of my pay had been assigned to Roger Berkrolles, under\nmy hand and signature, for the maintenance of our Bunny (so far as the\nrent might not provide it), and for the general management of things,\nand then to accumulate. So that, after all, I had not any amazing sum to\ndraw, remembering, too, that from time to time we had our little tastes\nof it. Nevertheless, when added up, I really was surprised to find that\nthe good clerks thought it worth so much quill-chop over it. And now I\nhad been for several years on the pay of a petty officer (master's\nmate), and looking forward to be master, if he were good enough to drop\noff.\n\nHe was truly tough, and would never drop off; and I felt it the more\nbecause he was ten years my junior, and unseasoned. He drew half again\nas much as I did, though he knew that I had done all the work. He gave\nme two fingers to say good-bye, which is a loathsome trick to me; so I\nput out my thumb, which was difficult to him: and the next time I saw\nhim, he lay dead in the cockpit of the Goliath.\n\nIn a word, I got so little after all my long endeavours to secure the\nBritish nation from its many enemies, that verily I must have fallen to\nthe old resource again, and been compelled to ask for alms to help me\nhome in 1790, as had happened to me in the year of grace 1759. We\nsailors always seem to be going either up or down so much, without\nseeming to know why. Perhaps it is a custom from our being on the waves\nso much. However, I was saved from doing such disgrace to the uniform\nand to my veteran aspect, and the hair by this time as white as snow,\nsimply through the liberality of our Captain Bampfylde. For he made me\nan offer both kind and handsome, though not more perhaps than might be\nexpected, after our sailing together so long. This was to take me home\nwith him to Narnton Court, or the neighbourhood, according to how the\nland might lie, and thence to secure me a passage (which is easy enough\nin the summer-time) by one of the stone-boats to Newton Nottage. I felt\nthat I might have come home in grander style than this was like to be;\nand yet it was better than begging my way; and scarcely any man should\nhope to be landed twice in all his life, at his native village from a\nman-of-war. Of course, if Master Rodney Bluett had still been with us,\nhe would have seen to my return, and been proud of it; but he had been\nforced to leave us, having received his appointment as 3d lieutenant to\nthe Boadicea, 74.\n\nTherefore I travelled with Captain Drake, and made myself useful upon\nthe road, finding his coxswain (who came with us in a miserably menial\nmanner) utterly useless, whenever a knowledge of life and the world was\ndemanded. And over and over again, my assistance paid my fare, I am sure\nof it, whether it were by coach or post. Because the great mass of\nseaman appear, whenever they come on shore, to enjoy a good cheating\nmore than anything. The reason is clear enough--to wit, that having seen\nno rogues so long, they are happy to pay for that pleasure now.\n\nIt was said that even the Admiralty had been playing the rogue with us,\nstopping our letters, and our news, to keep us altogether free from any\ndisturbances of home. At any rate, very few of us had heard a word of\nEngland, except from such old papers as we picked up in the colonies.\nAnd now, after seven years, how could we tell what to expect, or how\nmuch to fear?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\nAFTER SEVEN YEARS.\n\n\nFrom Exeter to Barnstaple, we crowded sail with horses' tails, and a\nheavy sea of mud leaping and breaking under the forefoot of our coach.\nAlso two boys on the horses, dressed like any admirals, one with horn on\nhis starboard thigh, and the other with jack-boots only. It was my\nprivilege to sit up in the foretop, as might be, with Coxswain Toms in\nthe mizentop, and the Captain down in the waist by himself. We made\nabout six knots an hour perhaps; whenever we got jerks enough to keep up\nthe swearing.\n\nBut the impatience of our Captain showed how very young he was, now at\nforty years of age, according to chronology, though nobody would believe\nit! Surely he might have waited well, after so long waiting; and if he\ncould not chew a quid--which breeds a whole brood of patience--at any\nrate he had fine pipes, and with common-sense might have kindled them. I\nhanded him down my flint and steel, and my hat to make a job of it; but\nhe shut up the glass, and cried, \"More sail!\" in a voice that almost\nfrightened me.\n\nIt was as dark as main-top-tree holes by the time we got to Barnstaple;\nbut we found no less than four fine lamps of sperm-oil burning, and\ntallow-candles here and there, in shops of spirit and enterprise. The\nhorses were stalled, and the baggage housed in a very fine inn, looking\nup the street, and then the Captain told Toms and me to house up our\njibs, while he went out. This we were only too glad to do after so much\nheavy rolling upon _terra firma_, as those landsmen love to call it, in\nspite of all earthquakes, such as killed thirty thousand Italian people,\nwhen first I took to the sea again.\n\nBut before long, Toms and I began to feel that we had no right to\nabandon our commander so. Here we were in a town that hardly ever saw a\nroyal sailor, and could not be supposed to know for a moment what his\nduties were, or even to take a proper pride in seeing him borne\nharmless. And here was our Captain gone out in the dark, with his\ncocked-hat on, and his gold lace shining wherever a tallow-candle hung;\nalso with a pleasant walk as if he were full of prize-money; though the\nEvil One had so patched up a peace that we never clinked a halfpenny.\n\nWhen old Jerry Toms and my humble self had scarcely gone through three\nglasses, he said to me, and I said to him, that we were carrying on too\ncoolly in a hostile town like this. And just at this moment the Navy was\ndown in popular estimation; for such is the public urgency, whenever we\nare paid for, without being killed or wounded. Therefore Jerry and I\nwere bound to steer with a small helm, and double the watch.\n\nWe beat up the enemy's quarters calmly, finding none to challenge us;\nand then we got tidings of our Captain out upon the Braunton road. Jerry\nwas a man of valour, and I could not hang back to be far behind him; and\nwe had been concerned in storming many savage villages. So we stormed\nthis little town, carrying our hangers, and nobody denied us. But before\nwe were half a mile entirely out of hearing, the mayor arose from his\nsupper, and turned out the watch, and beat the drums, and bred such\nalarm that in one street there were three more people alive ere morning.\n\nMeanwhile Jerry Toms and I shaped our course for the Braunton road, and\nhit it, and held on to it. And, because no man, in strange places, knows\nwhat the air may contain for him, Jerry sang a song, and I struck\nchorus; with such an effect that the cows were frightened all along the\nhedgerows. This put us quite on our legs again; and a more deeply sober\ncouple could not, or at any rate need not, be seen, than that which\nmyself and Jerry were, after two miles of walking.\n\nIn this manner, steering free, yet full of responsibility, we doubled\nthe last point of the road, where it fetches round to Narnton Court. And\nhere we lay to, and held council, out of the tide of the road, and in\nwhat seemed to be a lime-kiln.\n\nThe coxswain wanted to board the house, and demand our Captain out of\nit; we had carried all public opinion thus, and the right thing was to\ngo on with it. But I told him very strongly (so that he put down his\ncollar from his ears to listen) that no doubt he was right enough upon a\nhundred thousand subjects, yet was gone astray in this. And if we\nboarded a house at night, after carrying all the town by storm, what\nship had we to bear us away from the mayor and his constables to-morrow?\n\nIn this dilemma, who should appear but the Captain himself, with his\nhead bowed down, and his walk (which was usually so brisk in spite of a\ntrifling lameness), his very walk expressing that his heart was full of\nsadness.\n\n\"How much longer? How much longer?\" he was saying to himself, being so\ntroubled that he did not see us in the shadow there. \"My own brother to\nhave sworn it! Will the Lord never hold His hand from scourging and from\ncrushing me? Would that I were shot and shrouded! It is more than I can\nbear.\"\n\nIn this gloomy vein he passed us; and we looked at one another, daring\nnot to say a word. How could a pair of petty officers think of intruding\nupon the troubles and private affairs of a post-captain, even though,\nsince our ship was paid off, we could hardly be said to serve under him?\n\"Blow me out of the mouth of a gun,\" cried Coxswain Toms, in a shaking\nvoice, \"if ever I was so amazed before! I would have sworn that our\nSkipper was not only the handsomest but the happiest man in all the\nservice.\"\n\n\"Then, Jerry, I could have set you to rights. How many times have I\nhinted that our Skipper had something on his mind, and none of you would\nhearken me?\"\n\n\"True for you, my lad. I remember, now you come to speak of it. But we\npaid no heed; because you looked so devilish knowing, and would go no\nfurther. Old Dyo, I beg your pardon now; there is good stuff in you,\nfriend Dyo--thoroughly good stuff in you.\"\n\n\"I should rather think there was,\" I replied, perhaps a little drily,\nfor he ought to have known it long ago: \"Jerry, I could tell you things\nthat would burst the tar of your pig-tail. Nevertheless I will abstain,\nbeing undervalued so. Ho, shipmate! Haul your wind, and hail! I am\nblessed if it isn't old Heaviside!\"\n\nEven in the dark, I knew by the walk that it was a seaman, and now my\neyes were so accustomed to look out in all sorts of weather, that day or\nnight made little difference to my sense of vision, which (as you may\nsee hereafter) saved a British fleet, unless I do forget to tell of it.\n\n\"Heaviside is my name, sir. And I should like to know what yours may\nbe.\"\n\n\"David Llewellyn.\" And so we met; and I squeezed his hand till he longed\nto dance; and I was ready to cut a caper from my depth of feeling.\n\nI introduced him to Jerry Toms, according to strict formality; and both\nbeing versed in the rules of the service, neither would take precedence;\nbut each of them hung back for the other fellow to pretend to it, if he\ndared. I saw exactly how they stood; and being now, as master's mate,\nsuperior officer to both, I put them at their ease, by showing that we\nmust not be too grand. Thus being all in a happy mood, and desirous to\nmake the best of things, we could not help letting our Captain go to\ndwell upon his own fortunes. Not that we failed of desire to help him,\nbut that our own business pressed.\n\nGunner Heaviside led us down to a little cabin set up by himself on the\nvery brink of Tawe high-water mark, as a place of retirement when hard\npressed, and unable to hold his own in the bosom of his family. You may\nwell be surprised--for I was more, I was downright astonished--to find\nthat this was my old ferry-boat, set up (like a dog begging) on shores,\nwith the poop channelled into the sand, and the sides eked out with\ntarpaulin. A snugger berth I never saw for a quiet man to live in: and\nthough Heaviside scorned to tell us, and we disdained to ask him,\nthat--as I guessed from the first--was the true meaning of it. This poor\nfellow had been seduced--and I felt for his temptations--(when he came\nfresh from salt water, and our rolling ideas of women) into rapid\nmatrimony with that sharp Nanette. He ought to have known much better;\nand I ought to have given him warning; but when he had made up his mind\nto settle, I thought it was something solid. I gave him the names, as I\nmay have said, of good substantial farmers' daughters, owning at least a\ngood cow apiece from the date of their majority, also having sheets and\nblankets, and (as they told me many a time) picked goosefeathers enough\nfor two. And yet he must go and throw himself away upon that Nanette so!\n\nBut when I came to hear his case, and he for a moment would not admit\nthat it was worse than usual, or that he wanted pity more than any other\nmen do, and scarcely knew how far he ought, or dared even, to accept it;\nand then at the gurgling of his pipe, fancied that he heard somebody;\nJerry and I squeezed hands for a moment, and were very careful not to\ntantalise this poor man, with our strong-set resolution. \"Give a wide\nberth to all womankind,\" was what we would have said, if we could when\nnow it was too late for him; \"failing that, stand off and on, and let\nthe inhabitants come down, and push off their boats, and victual you.\"\n\nPoor Heaviside fetched a sigh enough to upset all arrangements; for\nJerry and I (good widowers both) were not likely to be damped, at the\nproper time for jollifying, by the troubles of a man who was meant to\nafford us rather a subject for rejoicing. Therefore we roused him up,\nand said, or at least conveyed to him, that he must not be so sadly down\nupon his luck like this. And hearing that he had six children now, and\nwas in fear of a seventh one, I was enabled to recollect more than\ntwenty instances of excellent women who had managed six, and gone off at\nthe seventh visitation.\n\nThis good news put such sudden spirit into my old shipmate, that he\nceased for a long time to be afeared of all that his wife could do to\nhim. He never said a word to show what his mind suggested to him,\nwhether good or evil. Only he made me tell those cases of unmerited\nmercy (as he put it) such a number of times that I saw what comfort he\nwas deriving. And then we challenged him to tell us what was going on\nwith him.\n\nHe seemed rather shy of discussing himself, but said that he was in Sir\nPhilip's service, as boatman, long-shoreman, and river-bailiff, also\npork-salter (as a son of the brine), and watercress-picker to the\nfamily. In a word, he had no work whatever to do; as you may pretty\nsafely conclude, when a man is compelled to go into a catalogue of his\nactivities. This sense of ease overweighed him no doubt, and made the\ntime hang heavily, after so much active service, so that Naval\nInstructor Heaviside moved about, and began to gossip, and having no\nbusiness of his own, spent his mind upon other folks'. Now, as we began\nto see through him, and the monotony of a fellow who is under his wife's\nthumb (without the frankness to acknowledge, and enlist our sympathies\nfor this universal burden), both Jerry and I desired to hear something a\nlittle more new than this. All things are good in their way, and devised\nby a finely careful Providence; so that no man, whose wife is a plague\nto him, can fail of one blessed reflection--to wit, that things are\nordered so for the benefit of his fellow-creatures.\n\nThus our noble Heaviside, not being satisfied with the state of things\nat home--especially after he had appealed to Nanette's strong sense of\nreason (which bore sway in the very first week of half the honeymoon\ngloriously), and after he had yielded slowly all his outworks of\ntobacco, coming down from plugs to pipes, and from pipes to paper\nthings, without stink enough to pay for rolling, and so on in the\ndownward course, till he would have been glad of dry sugar-canes, or the\nstems of \"old-man's beard,\"--this poor but very worthy fellow gallantly\nsurrendered, and resolved to rejoice, for the rest of his time, in his\nneighbours' business mainly.\n\nHerein he found great and constant change from his own sharp troubles.\nEverybody was glad to see him; and the wives who were the very hardest\nupon their own husbands, thought that he showed himself much too soft in\nthe matter of Madame Heaviside. It was not his place, when that subject\narose, to say either \"yes\" or \"no;\" but to put aside the question, as\none that cannot be debated, out of the house, with dignity. Only every\none liked him the more, the moment they remembered how contagious his\ncomplaint was.\n\nRegard this question as you will (according to lack of experience), it\nwas much for our benefit that the Naval Instructor was henpecked. He had\naccumulated things, such as no man can put together, whose wife allows\nhim to have his talk. If he may lay down the law, or even suggest for\nconsideration, he lets out half his knowledge, and forgets the other\nhalf of it. Whereas, if all his utterance is cut short at beginning, he\nhas a good chance to get something well condensed inside him. Thus, if\nyou find any very close-texture and terseness in my writings, the credit\nis due to my dear, good wife, who never let me finish a sentence. I\ndaresay she had trouble with me; and I must be fair to her. It takes a\nvery different man to understand a different woman; and these things\nwill often touch us too late, and too sadly. I gave her a beautiful\nfuneral, to my utmost farthing; and took her headstone upon credit,\nalmost before the sexton would warrant that the earth was settled.\n\nThat night my old friend Heaviside (who has led me, from like\nexperience, into a wholly different thing) showed some little of himself\nagain, before our whale-oil light began to splutter and bubble too\nviolently. Our society quite renewed his hope of getting away again;\nespecially when I explained to him that (according to my long\nacquaintance with law), no one could hold him accountable for any\nquantity of children which a Frenchwoman might happen to have. An alien,\nto wit, and a foreigner, worst of all a Frenchwoman, could not expect\nall her froggy confinements to hold good in England. He had committed a\nfoolish and unloyal act in buckling to with an alien enemy, and he\ndeserved to pay out for it; but I thought (and Coxswain Toms was of the\nsame opinion) that poor Heaviside now had suffered ever so much more\nthan even a Frenchwoman could expect of him. And we begged him to go\nafloat again.\n\nHe shook his head, and said that he had not invited our opinions, but to\na certain extent endeavoured to be thankful for them. Yet he suggested\ndelicately that after being so long at sea, we might have waited for our\nland-legs, before we became so positive. And if we would not mind\nallowing him to see to his own concerns, he would gladly tell all he\nknew about those of other people. This appeared to me to be a perfectly\nfair offer; but Jerry Toms took a little offence, on account of not\nknowing the neighbourhood. As superior officer of the three, I insisted\nupon silence, especially as from old times I knew what villany might be\naround us. And as soon as Heaviside could descry quite clearly what tack\nI stood upon, he distinctly gave his pledge to be open as the day.\nTherefore we all filled our pipes again, and took fresh lights for them,\nand looked at one another, while this old chap told his story. And\nplease to mind that he had picked up a prawn-netful of little trifles,\nsuch as I never could stoop to scoop, because he won such chances\nthrough the way the women pitied him. Only I must in ship-shape put his\nrambling mode of huddling things. If you please, we are now going back\nseven years, and more than that, to the very date of my escape from\nDevonshire; so as to tell you what none of us knew, until we met with\nHeaviside.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\nMISCHIEF IN A HOUSEHOLD.\n\n\nIt seems that no sooner did Parson Chowne discover how cleverly I had\nescaped him (after leaving my mark behind, in a way rather hard to put\nup with), than he began to cast about to win the last stroke somehow.\nAnd this, not over me alone, but over a very much greater man, who had\ncarried me off so shamefully--that is to say, Captain Bampfylde.\nHeaviside was not there as yet, but with us in the Alcestis, so that he\ncould not describe exactly the manner of Chowne's appearance. Only he\nheard from the people there, that never had such terror seized the house\nwithin human memory. Not that Chowne attempted any violence with any\none; but that all observed his silence, and were afraid to ask him.\n\nWhat was done that night between Sir Philip and the Parson, or even\nbetween the Parson and Sir Philip's heir, the Squire (whose melancholy\nroom that Chowne had dared to force himself into), nobody seemed to be\nsure, although every one craved to have better knowledge. But it was\ncertain that Isabel Carey went to her room very early that night, and\nwould have no Nanette for her hair; and in the morning was \"not fit for\nany one to look at,\" unless it were one who loved her.\n\nGreat disturbances of this sort happen (by some law of nature), often in\nlarge households. Give me the quiet cottage, where a little row, just\nnow and then, comes to pass, and is fought out, and lapses (when its\nheat is over) into very nice explanations, and women's heads laid on\nmen's shoulders, and tears that lose their way in smiles, and reproach\nthat melts into self-reproach. However, this was not the sort of thing\nthat any sane person could hope for in thirty miles' distance from\nMaster Stoyle Chowne, after once displeasing him. And what do you think\nParson Chowne did now, or at least I mean soon afterwards? That night he\nhad pressed his attentions on the beautiful young lady, so that in\nsimple self-defence she was forced to show her spirit. This aroused the\npower of darkness always lurking in him, so that his eyes shone, and his\njaws met, and his forehead was very smooth. For he had a noble forehead;\nand the worse his state of mind might be, the calmer was his upper brow.\nAfter frightening poor Miss Carey, not with words, but want of them\n(which is a far more alarming thing, when a man encounters women), he\ntook out his rights in the house by having an interview with Sir Philip;\nand no one could make any guess about what passed between them. Only it\ncould not be kept from knowledge of the household, that Parson Chowne\nobtained or took admission to Squire Philip also.\n\nOf this unhappy gentleman very little has been said, because I then knew\nso little. I am always the last man in the world to force myself into\nprivate things; and finding out once that I must not ask, never to ask\nis my rule of action, unless I know the people. However, it does not\nlook as if Master Heaviside had been gifted with any of this rare\ndelicacy. And thus he discovered as follows.\n\nSquire Philip's brain was not so strong as Captain Bampfylde's. He had\nbeen very good at figures, while things went on quietly; also able to\nride round and see the tenants, and deal with them, as the heir to a\nlarge estate should do. The people thought him very good: and that was\nabout the whole of it. He never hunted, he never shot, he did not even\ncare for fishing. A man may do without these things, if he gets repute\nin other ways (especially in witchcraft), but if he cannot show good\ncause for sticking thus inside four walls, an English neighbourhood is\napt to set him down for a milksop. And tenfold thus, if he has the means\nto ride the best horse, and to own the best dogs, and to wear the best\nbreeches that are to be bought.\n\nSquire Philip must not be regarded, however, with prejudice. He had good\nlegs, and a very good seat, and his tailor said the same of him. Also,\nhe took no objection to the scattering of a fox, with nothing left for\nhis brush to sweep up, and his smell made into incense; nor was the\nSquire, from any point of view, or of feeling, squeamish. Nevertheless\nhe did not give satisfaction as he should have done. He meant well, but\nhe did not outspeak it; only because to his quiet nature that appeared\nso needless. And the rough, rude world undervalued him, because he did\nnot overvalue himself. This was the man who had withdrawn, after deep\naffliction, into a life, or a death, of his own, abandoning hope too\nrapidly. He had been blessed, or cursed, by nature, with a large, soft\nheart; and not the flint in his brains there should be for a wholesome\nbalance. I know the men. They are not very common; and I should like to\nsee more of them.\n\nThis Squire Philip's hair was whiter than his father's now, they said;\nand his way of sitting, and of walking, growing older. No wonder, when\nhe never took a walk, or even showed himself; rather like a woman\nyielding, who has lost her only child. It is not my place to defend him.\nAll our ways are not alike. To my experience he seemed bound to grieve\nmost about his children. For a man may always renew his wife more easily\nthan his children. But Squire Philip's view of the matter took a\ndifferent starting-point. It was the loss of his wife that thus unwisely\novercame him.\n\nAccordingly he had given orders for women alone to come near him,\nbecause they reminded him of his wife, and went all around in a\nflat-footed way, and gave him to see that they never would ask, yet\ngladly would know, his sentiments. And living thus, he must have grown a\nlittle weak of mind, as all men do, with too much of a female circle\nround them.\n\nWhat Parson Chowne said to this poor gentleman, on the night we are\nspeaking of, was known to none except themselves and two or three maids\nwho listened at the door, because their duty compelled them thus to\nprotect their master. And all of these told different stories, agreeing\nonly upon one point; but the best of them told it, as follows. Chowne\nexpressed his surprise and concern at the change in his ancient friend's\nappearance, and said that it was enough to make him do what he often had\nthreatened to do. Squire Philip then asked what he meant by this; and he\nanswered in a deep, low voice, \"Bring to justice the villain who, for\nthe sake of his own advantage, has left my poor Philip childless: and\nwith all the fair Isabel's property too! Greedy, greedy scoundrel!\" They\ncould not see the poor Squire's face, when these words came home to him;\nbut they knew that he fell into a chair, and his voice so trembled that\nhe could not shape his answer properly.\n\n\"Then you too think, as I have feared, as I have prayed, as I would die,\nrather than be forced to think. My only brother! And I have been so kind\nto him for years and years. That he was strong and rough, I know--but\nsuch a thing, such a thing as this----\"\n\n\"He began to indulge his propensities for slaughter rather early--I\nthink I have heard people say.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, that boy at school. But this is a wholly different\nthing--what had my poor wife done to him?\"\n\n\"Did you ever hear that Drake Bampfylde offered himself to the Princess,\nwhile you were away from home, and a little before you did?\"\n\n\"I never heard anything of the kind. And I think that she would have\ntold me.\"\n\n\"I rather think not. It would be a very delicate point for a lady.\nHowever, it may not be true.\"\n\n\"Chowne, it is true, from the way you say it. You know it to be true;\nand you never told me, because it prevents any further doubt. Now I see\neverything, everything now. Chowne, you are one of the best of men.\"\n\n\"I know that I am,\" said the Parson, calmly; \"although it does not\nappear to be the public opinion. However, that will come right in the\nend. Now, my poor fellow, your wisest plan will be to leave yourself\naltogether to a thoroughly trustworthy man. Do you know where to find\nhim?\"\n\n\"Only in you, in you, my friend. My father will never come to see me,\nbecause--you know what I mean--because--I dared to think what is now\nproved true.\"\n\n\"Now, Philip, my old friend, you know what I am. A man who detests every\nkind of pretence. Even a little inclined perhaps to go too far the other\nway.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; I have always known it. You differ from other men; and the\ngreat fault of your nature is bluntness.\"\n\n\"Philip, you have hit the mark. I could not have put it so well myself.\nMy fine fellow, never smother yourself while you have such abilities.\"\n\n\"Alas! I have no abilities, Chowne. The whole of them went, when my\ngood-luck went. And if any remained to me, how could I care to use them?\nAfter what you have told me too. My life is over, my life is dead.\"\n\nAll the maids agreed at this point, and would scorn to contradict, that\npoor Squire Philip fell down in a lump, and they must have run in with\ntheir bottles and so on, only that the door was locked. Moreover, they\nfelt, and had the courage to whisper to one another, that they were a\nlittle timid of the Parson's witchcraft. There had been a girl in\nSherwell parish who went into the Parson's service, and because she\ndared to have a sweetheart on the premises, she had orders for half an\nhour, before and after the moon rose, to fly up and down the river Yeo,\nfrom Sherwell Mill to Pilton Bridge; and her own mother had seen her.\nTherefore these maids only listened.\n\n\"All this shows a noble vein of softness in you, my good friend\"--this\nwas the next thing they could hear--\"it is truly good and grand. What a\nhappy thing to have a darling wife and two sweet children, for the\npurpose of having them slain, and then in the grandeur of soul\nforgiving it! This is noble, this is true love! How it sets one\nthinking!\" This was the last that the maids could hear; for after that\nall was whispering. Only it was spread in every street, and road, and\nlane around, in about twelve hours afterwards, that a warrant from\nJustices Chowne and Rambone, and, with consent of Philip Bampfylde, was\nplaced in the hands of the officers of the peace for the apprehension of\nCaptain Drake, upon a charge of murder.\n\nWhen Sir Philip heard of this outrage on himself--and tenfold\nworse--upon their blameless lineage, he ordered his finest horse to be\nsaddled, and put some of his army-clothes on; not his best, for fear of\nvaunting, but enough to know him by. Then he rode slowly up and down the\nnarrow streets of Barnstaple, and sent for the mayor and the\ntown-council, who tumbled out of their shops to meet him. To these he\nread a copy of the warrant, obtained from the head-constable, and asked,\nupon what information laid, such a thing had issued. Betwixt their\nrespect for Sir Philip Bampfylde and their awe of Parson Chowne, these\npoor men knew not what to say, but to try to be civil to every one. Sir\nPhilip rode home to Narnton Court, and changed his dress, and his horse\nas well, and thus set off for Chowne's house.\n\nWhat happened there was known to none except the two parsons and the\nGeneral; but every one was amazed when Chowne, in company with Parson\nJack, rode into Barnstaple at full gallop, and redemanded his warrant\nfrom the head-constable, who held it, and also caused all entries and\ncopies thereof to be destroyed and erased, as might be; and for this he\ncondescended to assign no reason. In that last point he was consistent\nwith his usual character; but that he should undo his own act, was so\nunlike himself that no one could at first believe it. Of course people\nsaid that it was pity for Sir Philip's age and character and position,\nthat made him relent so: but others, who knew the man better, perceived\nthat he had only acted as from the first was his intention. He knew that\nthe Captain could not be taken, of course, for many a month to come, and\nhe did not mean to have him taken or put upon his trial; for he knew\nright well that there was no chance of getting him convicted. But by\nissue of that warrant he had stirred up and given shape to all the\nsuspicions now languishing, and had enabled good honest people to lay\ntheir heads together and shake them, and the boldest of them to whisper\nthat if a common man had done this deed, or been called in question of\nit, the warrant would have held its ground, until he faced an impartial\njury of his fellow-countrymen. And what was far more to Chowne's\npurpose, he had thus contrived to spread between Sir Philip and his\neldest son a deadly breach, unlikely ever to be bridged across at all,\nand quite sure to stand wide for healing, up to the dying hour. Because\nit was given to all to know that this vile warrant issued upon oath of\nSquire Philip and by his demanding; and the father's pride would never\nlet him ask if this were so.\n\nNow people tried to pass this over, as they do with unpleasant matters,\nand to say, \"let bygones go;\" yet mankind will never have things\nsmothered thus, and put away. When a game is begun, it should be played\nout: when a battle is fought, let it be fought out--these are principles\nquite as strong in the bosoms of spectators, as in our own breasts the\nfeeling--\"let us live our lives out.\"\n\nBut Isabel Carey's wrath would not have any reason laid near it. Her\nspirit was as fine and clear almost as her lovely face was, and she\nwould not even dream that evil may get the upper hand of us.\n\nShe said to Sir Philip, \"I will not have it. I will not stay in a house\nwhere such things can be said of any one. I am very nearly eighteen\nyears old, and I will not be made a child of. You have been wonderfully\nkind and good, and as dear to me as a father; but I must go away now; I\nmust go away.\"\n\n\"So you shall,\" said poor Sir Philip; \"it is the best thing that can be\ndone. You have another guardian, more fortunate than I am; and, my dear,\nyou shall go to him.\"\n\nThen she clung to his neck, and begged and prayed him not to think of it\nmore, only to let her stop where she was, in the home of all her\nhappiness. But the General was worse to move than the rock of Gibraltar,\nwhenever his honour was touched upon.\n\n\"My dear Isabel,\" he answered, \"you are young, and I am old. You were\nquicker than I have been, to see what harm might come to you. That is\nthe very thing which I am bound to save you from, my darling. I love you\nas if you were my own daughter; and this sad house will be, God knows,\ntenfold more sad without you. But it must be so, my child. You ought to\nbe too proud to cry, when I turn you out so.\"\n\nNot to dwell upon things too much--especially when grievous--Narnton\nCourt was compelled to get on without that bright young Isabel, and the\nfemale tailors who were always coming after her, as well as the noble\ngallants who hankered, every now and then, for a glimpse of her beauty\nand property. Isabel Carey went away to her other guardian, Lord\nPomeroy, at a place where a castle of powder was; and all the old people\nat Narnton Court determined not to think of it; while all the young folk\nsobbed and cried; and take it on the average, a guinea a-year was lost\nto them.\n\nAll this had happened for seven years now: but it was that last piece of\nnews, no doubt, almost as much as the warrant itself, that made our\nCaptain carry on so when we were in the lime-kiln. Because Lord Pomeroy\nhad forbidden Isabel to write to her lover, while in this predicament.\nHe, on the other hand, getting no letters, without knowing why or\nwherefore, was too proud to send any to her.\n\nWe saw the force of this at once, especially after our own\ncorrespondence (under both mark and signature) had for years been like\nthe wind, going where it listeth. So we resolved to stop where we were,\nupon receipt of rations; and Heaviside told us not to be uneasy about\nanything. For although he durst not invite us to his own little cottage,\nor rather his wife Nanette's, he stood so well in the cook's good graces\nthat he could provide for us; so he took us into the kitchen of Narnton\nCourt, where they made us very welcome as Captain Drake's retainers, and\ntold us all that had happened since the departure of Miss Isabel,\nbetween Narnton Court and Nympton. In the first place, Parson Chowne had\nbeen so satisfied with his mischief, that he spared himself time for\nanother wedlock, taking as Mrs Chowne No. 4 a young lady of some wealth\nand beauty, but reputed such a shrew that nobody durst go near her.\nBefore she had been Mrs Chowne a fortnight, her manners were so much\nimproved that a child might contradict her; and within a month she had\nlost the power of frowning, but had learned to sigh. However, she was\nstill alive, having a stronger constitution than any of the Parson's\nformer wives.\n\nParson Jack had also married, and his wife was a good one; but Chowne\n(being out of other mischief) sowed such jealousies between them for his\nown enjoyment, that poor Master Rambone had taken to drink, and his wife\nwas so driven that she almost did the thing she was accused of. Very\nseldom now did either of these two great parsons come to visit Sir\nPhilip Bampfylde. Not that the latter entertained any ill-will towards\nChowne for the matter of the warrant. For that he blamed his own son,\nthe Squire, having received Chowne's version of it, and finding poor\nPhilip too proud and moody to offer any explanation.\n\nWe had not been at Narnton Court more than a night, before I saw the\nbrave General; for hearing that I was in the house, and happening now to\nremember my name, he summoned me into his private room, to ask about the\nCaptain, who had started off (as I felt no doubt) for the castle of Lord\nPomeroy. I found Sir Philip looking of course much older from the seven\nyears past, but as upright and dignified, and trustful in the Lord as\never. Nevertheless he must have grown weaker, though he did his best to\nhide it; for at certain things I told him of his favourite son, great\ntears came into his eyes, and his thin lips trembled, and he was forced\nto turn away without finishing his sentences. Then he came back, as if\nashamed of his own desire to hide no shame, and he put his flowing white\nhair back, and looked at me very steadily.\n\n\"Llewellyn,\" he said, \"I trust in God. Years of trouble have taught me\nthat. I speak to you as a friend almost, from your long acquaintance\nwith my son, and knowledge of our story. My age will be three score\nyears and ten, if I live (please God) till my next birthday. But I tell\nyou, David Llewellyn, and I beg you to mark my words, I shall not die\nuntil I have seen the whole of this mystery cleared off, the honour of\nmy name restored, and my innocent son replaced in the good opinion of\nmankind.\"\n\nThis calm brave faith of a long-harassed man in the goodness of his\nMaker made me look at him with admiration and with glistening eyes; for\nI said to myself that with such a deep knave as Chowne at the bottom of\nhis troubles, his confidence even in the Lord was very likely to be\nmisplaced. And yet the very next day we made an extraordinary discovery,\nwhich went no little way to prove the soundness of the old man's faith.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\nA BREATHLESS DISINTERMENT.\n\n\nBy this time we were up to all the ins and outs of everything. A sailor\nhas such a knowledge of knots, and the clever art of splicing, that you\ncannot play loose tricks, in trying on a yarn with him. Jerry Toms and I\nwere ready, long before that day was out, to tie up our minds in a\nbow-line knot, and never more undo them. Jerry went even beyond my\nviews, as was sure to be, because he knew so much less of the matter; he\nwould have it that Parson Chowne had choked the two children without any\naid, and then in hatred and mockery of the noble British uniform, had\nburied them deep in Braunton Burrows, wearing a cockade for a shovel\nhat, purely by way of outrage.\n\nOn the other hand, while I agreed with Jerry up to a certain distance, I\nknew more of Parson Chowne (whom he never had set eyes upon) than to\nlisten to such rubbish. And while we agreed in the main so truly, and\nthoroughly praised each other's wisdom, all the people in the house made\nso highly much of us, that Jerry forgot the true line of reasoning, even\nbefore nine o'clock at night, and dissented from my conclusions so\nwidely, and with so much arrogance, that it did not grieve me (after he\ngot up) to have knocked him down like a ninepin.\n\nHowever, in the morning he was all right, and being informed upon every\nside that the cook did it with the rolling-pin, he acknowledged the\njustice of it, having paid more attention to her than a married lady\nshould admit, though parted from her husband. However, she forgave him\nnobly, and he did the same to her; and I, with all my knowledge of\nwomen, made avowal in the presence of the lady-housekeeper, that my only\nuneasiness was to be certain whether I ought to admire the more Jerry's\nbehaviour or Mrs Cook's. And the cook had no certainty in the morning,\nexactly what she might have done.\n\nThis little matter made a stir far beyond its value; and having some\nknowledge of British nature, I proposed to the comitatus, with deference\nboth to the cook and housekeeper, also a glance at the first housemaid,\nthat we should right all misunderstanding by dining together\ncomfortably, an hour before the usual time. Because, as I clearly\nexpressed it, yet most inoffensively, our breakfast had been ruined by a\npiece, I might say, of misconstruction overnight between two admirable\npersons. And Heaviside came in just then, and put the cap on all of it,\nby saying that true sailors were the greatest of all sportsmen;\ntherefore, in honour of our arrival, he had asked, and got leave from\nthe gamekeepers, to give a great rabbiting that afternoon down on\nBraunton Burrows; and he hoped that Mrs Cockhanterbury, being the\nlady-housekeeper, would grace the scene with her presence, and let every\nmaid come to the utmost.\n\nHeaviside's speech, though nothing in itself, neither displaying any\nmanner at all, was received with the hottest applause; and for some time\nJerry and I had to look at one another, without any woman to notice us.\nWe made allowance for this, of course, although we did not like it. For,\nafter all, who was Heaviside? But we felt so sorely the ill effects of\nthe absence of perfect harmony upon the preceding evening (when all our\nmale members of the human race took more or less the marks of knuckles),\nthat a sense of stiffness helped us to make no objection to anything.\nAnd tenfold thus, when we saw how the maids had made up their minds for\nfrolicking.\n\nThese young things must have their way, as well as the nobler lot of us:\nfor they really have not so very much less of mind than higher women\nhave; and they feel what a woman is too well to push themselves so\nforward. They know their place, and they like their place, and they\ntempt us down into it.\n\nBe that either way--and now unwomanly women waste their good brains upon\na trifle of this kind--rabbiting was to be our sport; and no sooner was\nthe dinner done, and ten minutes given to the maids to dress, than every\ndog on the premises worth his salt was whistled for. It would have\namused you to see the maids, or I might say all the womankind, coming\nout with their best things on, and their hair done up, and all\npretending never even to have seen a looking-glass.\n\nMadame Heaviside (as she commanded all people to entitle her) was of the\nwhole the very grandest as regards appearance. Also in manner and\ncarrying on; but of this I have no time to speak. Enough that the former\nNaval Instructor thought it wiser to keep his own place, and let her\nflirt with the game keepers. We had dogs, and ferrets, and nets, and\nspades, and guns for those who were clever enough to keep from letting\nthem off at all, and to frighten the women without any harm. There must\nhave been five-and-twenty of us in number altogether, besides at least a\nscore of children who ran down from Braunton village, when they saw what\nwe were at. There was no restraint laid upon us by any presence of the\ngentry; for Sir Philip was not in the humour for sport, and the Squire\nof course kept himself to his room; and as for the Captain, we had no\ntoken of his return from South Devon yet.\n\nTherefore we had the most wonderful fun, enjoying the wildness of\nthe place, and the freshness of the river air, and wilfulness of\nthe sandhills, also the hide-and-seek of the rushes, and the many\nups and downs and pleasure of helping the young women in and out,\nalso how these latter got (if they had any feet to be proud of)\ninto rabbit-holes on purpose to be lifted out of them, and fill the\nrosettes of their shoes, and have them dusted by a naval man's very\nbest pocket-handkerchief--together with a difficulty of standing on one\nfoot while doing it, or having it done to them, and a fear of breathing\ntoo much out--after smothered rabbit at dinner-time--which made their\nfigures look beautiful. Enough that I took my choice among them, for\nconsideration; and jotted down the names of three, who must have\nsome cash from their petticoats. Let nobody for a moment dream that\nI started with this intention. The rest of my life was to be devoted\nto the Royal Navy, if only a hot war should come again; of which we\nalready felt simmerings. But I could not regard all these things, after\nso many years at sea, without some desire for further acquaintance with\nthe meaning of everything. At sea we forget a great deal of their ways.\nWhen we come ashore--there they are again!\n\nThis is a very childish thing for a man like me to think of.\nNevertheless I do fall back from perfect propriety sometimes; never as\nregards money; but when my feelings are touched by the way in which\nsuperior young women try to catch me; or when my opinion is asked\nconscientiously as to cordials. And this same afternoon the noble\nclearness of the sun and air, and the sound of merry voices glancing\nwhere all the world (unless it were soft sand) would have echoed them,\nand the sense of going sporting--which is half the game of it--these and\nother things, as well as the fatness of the rabbits' backs, and great\nskill not to bruise them, led the whole of us, more or less, into\ncontemplation of Nature's beauties. We must have killed more than a\nhundred and fifty coneys, in one way and another, when Heaviside came\nup, almost at a run, to a hill where Jerry Toms and I were sitting down,\nto look about a bit, and to let the young women admire us.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" said I, not liking to be interrupted thus.\n\n\"Matter enough,\" he panted out; \"where is Madame? The Lord keep her\naway.\"\n\n\"Madame is gone down to the water-side,\" said Jerry, though I frowned at\nhim, \"together with that smart young fellow--I forget his\nname--under-keeper they call him.\"\n\n\"Hurrah, my hearties!\" cried Heaviside; \"that is luck, and no mistake.\nNow lend a hand, every lubber of you. Her pet dog Snap is in the sand;\n'with the devil to pay, and no pitch hot,' if we take long to get him\nout again.\"\n\nWe knew what he meant; for several dogs of an over-zealous character had\ngot into premature burial in the rabbit-galleries, through the stupidity\nof people who crowded upon the cone over them. Some had been dug out\nalive, and some dead, according to what their luck was. And now we were\nbound to dig out poor Snap, and woe to us all if we found him dead!\n\nI took the biggest spade, as well as the entire command of all of us,\nand we started at quick step for the place which Heaviside pointed out\nto us. He told us, so far as his breath allowed, that his small brown\nterrier Snap had found a rabbit of tender age hiding in a tuft of\nrushes. Snap put all speed on at once, but young bunny had the heels of\nhim, and flipped up her tail at the mouth of a hole, with an air of\ndefiance which provoked Snap beyond all discretion. He scarcely stopped\nto think before he plunged with a yelp into the hole, while another and\na wiser dog came up, and shook his ears at it. For a little while they\nheard poor Snap working away in great ecstasy, scratching at narrow\nturns, and yelping when he almost got hold of fur. Heaviside stood, in\nhis heavy way, whistling into the entrance-hole, which went down from a\nsteep ascent with a tuft of rushes over it. But Snap was a great deal\ntoo gamesome a dog to come back--even if he heard him. Meanwhile a lot\nof bulky fellows, who could do no more than clap their hands, got on the\nbrow of the burrow and stamped, and shouted to Snap to dig deeper. Then\nof a sudden the whole hill slided, as a hollow fire does, and cast a\ngreat part of itself into a deep gully on the north of it. And those\ngreat louts who had sent it down so, found it very hard (and never\ndeserved) to get their clumsy legs out.\n\nNo wonder that Heaviside had made such a run to come and fetch us. For\nSnap must be now many feet underground, and the Naval Instructor knew\nwhat it would be to go home to Nanette without him. He stood above the\nslip and listened, and there was no bark of Snap; while to my mind came\nback strangely thoughts of the five poor sons of Sker, and of the little\nchild dwelling in sand, forlorn and abandoned Bardie.\n\n\"Dig away, my lads, dig away!\" I cried, from force of memory, and\nsetting example to every one; \"I have seen a thing like this before; it\nonly wants quick digging.\" We dug and dug, and drove our pit through\nseveral decks of rabbit-berths; and still I cried \"Dig on, my lads!\"\nalthough they said it was hopeless. Then suddenly some one struck\nsomething hard, and cried \"Halloa!\" and frightened us. We crowded round,\nand I took the lead, and made the rest keep back from me, in right of\nsuperior discipline. And thence I heaved out a beautiful cocked-hat of a\nBritish Captain of the Royal Navy, with Snap inside of it and not quite\ndead!\n\nSuch a cheer and sound arose (the moment that Snap gave a little sniff),\nfrom universal excitement and joy, with Heaviside at the head of it,\nthat I feared to be hoisted quite out of the hole, and mounted on human\nshoulders. This I like well enough now and then, having many a time\ndeserved without altogether ensuing it; but I could not stop to think of\nany private triumph now. The whole of my heart was hot inside me,\nthrough what I was thinking of.\n\nThat poor honest fellow, who so eschewed the adornment of the outward\nman, and carried out pure Christianity so as to take no heed of what he\nwore, or whether he wore anything whatever; yet who really felt for\npeople of a weaker cultivation, to such an extreme that he hardly ever\nwent about by day much,--this noble man had given evidence such as no\nman, who had lost respect by keeping a tailor, could doubt of. In\nitself, it was perspicuous; and so was the witness, before he put up\nwith a sack, in order to tender it.\n\nThe whole force of this broke upon me now; while the others were showing\nthe hat round, or blowing into the little dog's nostrils, and with a\nrabbit's tail tickling him; because in a single glance I had seen that\nthe hat was our Captain Bampfylde's. And then I thought of old Sir\nPhilip, striding sadly along these burrows, for ever seeking something.\n\n\"Dig away, dig away, my lads. Never mind the little dog. Let the maidens\nsee to him. Under our feet there is something now, worth a hundred\nthousand dogs.\"\n\nAll the people stood and stared, and thought that I was off my wits; and\nbut for my uniform, not one would ever have stopped to harken me. It was\nuseless to speak to Heaviside. The whole of his mind was exhausted by\nanxiety as to his wife's little dog. No sleep could he see before him\nfor at least three lunar months, unless little Snap came round again. So\nI had to rely on myself alone, and Jerry Toms, and two gamekeepers.\n\nAll these were for giving up; because I can tell you it is no joke to\nthrow out spadeful after spadeful of this heavy deceitful sand, with\nhalf of it coming back into the hole; and the place where you stand not\nsteadfast. And the rushes were combing darkly over us, showing their\nginger-coloured roots, and with tufts of jagged eyebrows threatening\noverwhelment. For our lives we worked away--with me (as seems to be my\nfate) compelled to be the master--and all the people looking down, and\nready to revile us, if we could not find a stirring thing. But we did\nfind a stirring thing, exactly as I will tell you.\n\nFor suddenly my spade struck something soft, something which returned no\nsound, and yet was firm enough to stop, or at any rate to clog the tool.\nAlthough it was scarcely twilight yet, and many people stood around us,\na feeling not of fear so much as horror seized upon me. Because this was\nnot like the case of digging out poor bodies smothered by accident or\nthe will of God, but was something far more dreadful; proof, to wit, of\natrocious murder done by villany of mankind upon two little helpless\nbabes. So that I scarce could hold the spade, when a piece of white\nlinen appeared through the sand, and then some tresses of long fair\nhair, and then two little hands crossed on the breast, and a set of\nsmall toes sticking upward. And close at hand lay another young body, of\nabout the same size, or a trifle larger.\n\nAt this terrible sight, the deepest breath of awe drew through all of\nus, and several of the women upon the hill shrieked and dropped, and the\nchildren fled, and the men feared to come any nearer. Even my three or\nfour fellow-diggers leaped from the hole with alacrity, leaving me all\nby myself to go on with this piteous disinterment. For a moment I\ntrembled too much to do so, and leaned on my spade in the dusky grave,\nwatching the poor little things, and loath to break with sacrilegious\nhands such innocent and eternal rest. \"Ye pure and stainless souls,\" I\ncried, \"hovering even now above us, in your guardian angel's arms, and\nappealing for judgment on your icy-hearted murderer, pardon me for thus\ninvading, in the sacred cause of justice, the calm sleep of your\ntenements.\"\n\nIn this sad and solemn moment, with all the best spectators moved to\ntears by my deep eloquence, as well as their own rich sympathies, it\nstruck me that the legs of one of the corpses stuck up rather strangely.\nI had not been taken aback, at all, by the bright preservation of hands\nand toes, because I knew well what the power of sand is when the air is\nkept far away; but it was dead against all my experience, that even a\nbaby, eight years buried, should have that muscular power of leg.\nWithout any further hesitation, up I caught the nearest of them, being\ndesperate now to know what would be the end of it.\n\nThree or four women, whose age had passed from lying in to laying out,\nnow ran down the hill in great zealousness; but though their profession\nis perhaps the most needful of all yet invented by human nature, there\nwas no exercise for it now. For behold, in the evening light, and on the\nbrink of the grave, were laid two very handsome and large Dutch dolls,\nclad in their night-gowns, and looking as fresh as when they left the\ndoll-maker's shop. The sand remained in their hair of course, and in\ntheir linen, but fell away (by reason of its dryness) from their faces,\nand hands, and feet, the whole of which were of fine hard wax. But the\njoints of their arms and legs had stiffened, from having no children to\nwork them, also their noses had been spoiled at some stage of their\nobsequies; and upon the whole it seemed hard to say whether their\nappearance was more ludicrous or deplorable.\n\nHowever, that matter was settled for them by the universal guffaw of the\nfellows who had been scared of their scanty wits not more than two\nminutes since, but all of whom now were as brave as lions to make\nlaughter at my expense. This is a thing which I never allow, but very\nsoon put a stop to it. And so I did now, without any hard words, but\nturning their thoughts discreetly.\n\n\"Come, my lads,\" I said, \"we have done a better turn to the gentleman\nwho feeds us, than if we had found two thousand babies, such as you ran\naway from. Rally round me, if you have a spark of courage in your\nloutish bodies. You little know how much hangs on this; while in your\nclumsy witless way, you are making a stupid joke of it. Mr Heaviside, I\npray you, seek for me Mistress Cockhanterbury; while I knock down any\nrogue who shows the impudence to come near me.\"\n\nEvery man pulled his proud stomach in, when I spoke of the\nlady-housekeeper, who was a Tartar, high up on a shelf, allowing no\nmargin for argument. She appeared in the distance, as managing-women\nalways do when called upon; and she saw the good sense of what little I\nsaid, and she laid them all under my orders.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX.\n\nONE WHO HAS INTERRED HIMSELF.\n\n\nSuch an effect was now produced all over all around us, that every man\npressed for his neighbour's opinion, rather than offer his own, almost.\nThis is a state of the public mind that cannot be long put up with; for\nhalf the pleasure goes out of life when a man is stinted of argument.\nBut inasmuch as I was always ready for all comers, and would not for a\nmoment harken any other opinion, the great bulk of conclusion ran into\nthe grooves I laid for it.\n\nThis was neither more nor less than that Satan's own chaplain, Chowne,\nwas at the helm of the whole of it. Some people said that I formed this\nopinion through an unchristian recollection of his former rudeness to\nme; I mean when he blew me out of bed, and tried to drown, and to burn\nme alive. However, the great majority saw that my nature was not of this\nsort, but rather inclined to reflect with pleasure upon any spirited\nconduct. And to tell the whole truth, upon looking back at the Parson, I\nadmired him more than any other man I had seen, except Captain Nelson.\nFor it is so rare to meet with a man who knows his own mind thoroughly,\nthat if you find him add thereto a knowledge of his neighbours' minds,\ncertain you may be that here is one entitled to lead the nation. He may\nbe almost too great to care about putting this power in exercise, unless\nany grand occasion betides him; just as Parson Chowne refused to go into\nthe bishopric; and just as Nelson was vexed at being the supervisor of\nsmugglers. Nevertheless these men are ready, when God sees fit to\nappoint them.\n\nHowever, to come back to these dolls, and the opening now before them.\nThe public (although at first disappointed not to have found two real\nbabies strangled in an experienced manner) perceived the expediency of\nrejoicing in the absence of any such horror. Only there were many\npeople, of the lower order, so disgusted at this cheat, and strain upon\ntheir glands of weeping, with no blood to show for it, that they\ndeclared their firm resolve to have nothing more to do with it.\n\nFor my part, being some little aware of the way in which laurels are\nstolen, I kept my spade well up, and the two dolls in my arms, with\ntheir heads down, and even their feet grudged to the view of the\ngossipers. In the midst of an excited mob, a calm sight of the right\nthing to do may lead them almost anywhere. And I saw that the only\nproper thing was to leave everything to me. They (with that sense of\nfairness which exists in slow minds more than in quick ones) fell behind\nme, because all knew that the entire discovery was my own. Of course\nwithout Snap I could never have done it; nor yet without further\naccidents: still there it was; and no man even of our diffident Welsh\nnation, can in any fairness be expected to obscure himself.\n\nMy tendency, throughout this story, always has been to do this. But I\nreally did begin to feel the need of abjuring this national fault, since\nmen of a mixture of any sort, without even Celtic blood in them, over\nand over again had tried to make a mere nobody of me.\n\nHence it was, and not from any desire to advance myself, that among the\ninferior race, I stood upon my rights, and stuck to them. If ever there\nhad been any drop of desire for money left in me, after perpetual\npurification (from seven years of getting only coppers, and finding most\nof them forgeries), this scene was alone sufficient to make me glad of\nan empty purse. For any man who has any money must long to put more to\nit; as the children pile their farthings, hoping how high they may go. I\nlike to see both old and young full of schemes so noble; only they must\nlet an ancient fellow like me keep out of them.\n\nThese superior senses glowed within me, and would not be set aside by\nany other rogue preceding me, when I knocked at Sir Philip's door, and\nclaimed first right of audience. The other fellows were all put away by\nthe serving-men, as behoved them; then I carried in everything, just as\nit was, and presented the whole with the utmost deference.\n\nSir Philip had inkling of something important, and was beginning to\nshake now and then; nevertheless he acknowledged my entrance with his\nwonted dignity; signed to the footman to refresh the sperm-oil lamps in\nthe long dark room; and then to me to come and spread my burden on a\ntable. Nothing could more clearly show the self-command which a good man\nwins by wrestling long with adversity. For rumour had reached him that I\nhad dug up his son's cocked-hat, and his two grandchildren, all as fresh\nas the day itself. It is not for me (who have never been so deeply\nstirred in the grain of the heart by heaven's visitations) to go through\nand make a show of this most noble and ancient gentleman's doings, or\nfeelings, or language even. A man of low station, like myself, would be\nloath to have this done to him, at many and many a time of his life; so\n(if I could even do it in the case of a man so far above me, and so far\nmore deeply harrowed) instead of being proud of describing, I must only\ndespise myself.\n\nEnough to say that this snowy-haired, most simple yet stately gentleman,\nmixed the usual mixture of the things that weep and the things that\nlaugh; which are the joint-stock of our nature, from the old Adam and\nthe young one. What I mean--if I keep to facts--is, that he knelt on a\nstrip of canvas laid at the end of the table, and after some trouble to\nplace his elbows (because of the grit of the sandiness), bowed his white\nforehead and silvery hair, and the calm majesty of his face, over those\ntwo dollies, and over his son's very best cocked-hat, and in silence\nwept thanksgiving to the great Father of everything.\n\n\"David Llewellyn,\" he said, as he rose and approached me as if I were\nquite his equal; \"allow me to take your hand, my friend. There are few\nmen to whom I would sooner owe this great debt of gratitude than\nyourself, because you have sailed with my son so long. To you and your\npatience and sagacity, under the mercy of God, I owe the proof, or at\nany rate these tokens of my poor son's innocence. I--I thank the Lord\nand you----\"\n\nHere the General for the moment could not say another word.\n\n\"It is true, your Worship,\" I answered, \"that none of your own people\nshowed the sense or the courage to go on. But it is a Welshman's honest\npride to surpass all other races in valour and ability. I am no more\nthan the very humblest of my ancestors may have been.\"\n\n\"Then all of them must have been very fine fellows,\" Sir Philip replied,\nwith a twinkling glance. \"But now I will beg of you one more favour.\nCarry all these things, just as they are, to the room of my son, Mr\nPhilip Bampfylde.\"\n\nAt first I was so taken aback that I could only gaze at him. And then I\nbegan to think, and to see the reason of his asking it.\n\n\"I have asked you to do a strange thing, good David; if it is an\nunpleasant one, say so in your blunt sailor's fashion.\"\n\n\"Your honour,\" I answered, with all the delicacy of my nature upwards;\n\"say not another word. I will do it.\"\n\nFor truly to speak it, if anything had been often a grief and a care to\nme, it was the bitterness of thinking of that Squire Philip deeply, and\nnot knowing anything. The General bowed to me with a kindness none could\ntake advantage of, and signalled me to collect my burden. Then he\nappointed me how to go, together with a very old and long-accustomed\nservitor. Himself would not come near his son, for fear of triumph over\nhim.\n\nAfter a long bit of tapping, and whispering, and the mystery servants\nalways love to make of the simplest orders, I was shown with my arms\nwell aching (for those wooden dolls were no joke, and the Captain's hat\nweighed a stone at least, with all the sand in the lining) into a dark\nroom softly strewn, and hung with ancient damask. The light of the\nevening was shut out, and the failure of the candles made it seem a\ncloudy starlight. Only in the furthest corner there was light enough to\nsee by; and there sate, at a very old desk, a white-haired man with his\nhat on.\n\nIf I can say one thing truly (while I am striving at every line to tell\nthe downright honesty), this truth is that my bones and fibres now grew\ncold inside of me. There was about this man, so placed, and with the\ndimness round him, such an air of difference from whatever we can reason\nwith, and of far withdrawal from the ways of human nature, as must send\na dismal shudder through a genial soul like mine. There he sate, and\nthere he spent three parts of his time with his hat on, gazing at some\nold grey tokens of a happy period, but (so far as could be judged)\nhoping, fearing, doing, thinking, even dreaming--nothing! He would not\nallow any clock or watch, or other record of time in the chamber, he\nwould not read or be read to, neither write or receive a letter.\n\nThere he sate, with one hand on his forehead pushing back the old dusty\nhat, with his white hair straggling under it and even below the gaunt\nshoulder-blades, his face set a little on one side, without any kind of\nmeaning in it, unless it were long weariness, and patient waiting God's\ntime of death.\n\nI was told that once a-day, whenever the sun was going down over the\nbar, in winter or summer, in wet or dry, this unfortunate man arose, as\nif he knew the time by instinct without view of heaven, and drew the\nvelvet curtain back and flung the shutter open, and for a moment stood\nand gazed with sorrow-worn yet tearless eyes upon the solemn hills and\nwoods, and down the gliding of the river, following the pensive footfall\nof another receding day. Then with a deep sigh he retired from all\nchance of starlight, darkening body, mind, and soul, until another\nsunset.\n\nUpon the better side of my heart, I could feel true pity for a man\noverwhelmed like this by fortune; while my strength of mind was vexed to\nsee him carry on so. Therefore straight I marched up to him, when I\nbegan to recover myself, having found no better way of getting through\nperplexity.\n\nAs my footsteps sounded heavily in the gloomy chamber, Squire Philip\nturned, and gazed at first with cold displeasure, and then with strong\namazement at me. I waited for him to begin, but he could not, whether\nfrom surprise or loss of readiness through such long immurement.\n\n\"May it please your Honour,\" I said; \"the General has sent me hither to\nclear my Captain from the charge of burying your Honour's children.\"\n\n\"What--what do you mean?\" was all that he could stammer forth, while his\nglassy eyes were roving from my face to the dolls I bore, and round the\nroom, and then back again.\n\n\"Exactly as I say, your Honour. These are what the wild man took for\nyour two children in Braunton Burrows; and here is the Captain's\ncocked-hat, which some one stole, to counterfeit him. The whole thing\nwas a vile artifice, a delusion, cheat, and mockery.\"\n\nI need not repeat how I set this before him, but only his mode of\nreceiving it. At first he seemed wholly confused and stunned, pressing\nhis head with both hands, and looking as if he knew not where he was.\nThen he began to enter slowly into what I was telling him, but without\nthe power to see its bearing, or judge how to take it. He examined the\ndolls, and patted them, and added them to a whole school which he kept,\nwith two candles burning before them. And then he said, \"They have long\nbeen missing: I am pleased to recover them.\"\n\nThen for a long time he sate in silence, and in his former attitude,\nquite as if his mind relapsed into its old condition: and verily I began\nto think that the only result of my discovery, so far as concerned poor\nSquire Philip, would be a small addition to his gallery of dolls.\nHowever, after a while he turned round, and cried with a piercing gaze\nat me--\n\n\"Mariner, whoever you are, I do not believe one word of your tale. The\nhat is as new and the dolls are as fresh as if they were buried\nyesterday. And I take that to be the truth of it. How many years have I\nbeen here? I know not. Bring me a looking-glass.\"\n\nHe pointed to a small mirror which stood among his precious relics.\nBeing mounted with silver and tortoise-shell, this had been (as they\ntold me afterwards) the favourite toy of his handsome wife. When I\nhanded him this, he took off his hat, and shook his white hair back, and\ngazed earnestly, but without any sorrow, at his mournful image.\n\n\"Twenty years at least,\" he pronounced it, in a clear decided voice;\n\"twenty years it must have taken to have made me what I am. Would twenty\nyears in a dripping sandhill leave a smart gentleman's laced hat and a\npoor little baby's dolls as fresh and bright as the day they were\nburied? Old mariner, I am sorry that you should lend yourself to such\ndevices. But perhaps you thought it right.\"\n\nThis, although so much perverted, made me think of his father's goodness\nand kind faith in every one. And I saw that here was no place now for\nany sort of argument.\n\n\"Your Honour is altogether wrong,\" I answered, very gently: \"the matter\ncould have been, at the utmost, scarcely more than eight years ago,\naccording to what they tell me. And if you can suppose that a man of my\nrank and age and service would lend himself to mean devices, there are\nat least thirty of your retainers, and of honest neighbours, who have\nseen the whole thing and can swear to its straightforwardness. And your\nHonour, of course, knows everything a thousand times better than I do;\nbut of sand, and how it keeps things everlasting (so long as dry), your\nHonour seems, if I may say it, to have no experience.\"\n\nHe did not take the trouble to answer, but fell back into his old way of\nsitting, as if there was nothing worth argument.\n\nPeople say that every man is like his father in many ways; but the\nfirst resemblance that I perceived between Sir Philip and his elder son\nwas, that the squire arose and bowed with courtesy as I departed.\n\nUpon the whole, this undertaking proved a disappointment to me. And it\nmattered a hundredfold as much that our noble General was not only\nvexed, but angered more than one could hope of him. Having been treated\na little amiss, I trusted that Sir Philip would contribute to my\nself-respect by also feeling angry. Still I did not desire more than\njust enough to support me, or at the utmost to overlap me, and give me\nthe sense of acting aright by virtue of appeasing him. But on the\npresent occasion he showed so large and cloudy a shape of anger, wholly\nwithdrawn from my sight (as happens with the Peak of Teneriffe)--also he\nso clearly longed to be left alone and meditate, that I had no chance to\noffer him more than three opinions. All these were of genuine value at\nthe time of offering; and must have continued so to be, if the facts had\nnot belied them. Allowing for this adverse view, I will not even state\nthem.\n\nNevertheless I had the warmest invitation to abide, and be welcome to\nthe best that turned upon any of all the four great spits, or simmered\nand lifted the pot-lids suddenly for a puff of fine smell to come out in\nadvance. To a man of less patriotic feeling this might thus have\ncommended itself. But to my mind there was nothing visible in these\nhills and valleys, and their sloping towards the sea, which could make a\ntrue Welshman doubt the priority of Welshland. For with us the sun is\nbetter, and the air moves less in creases, and the sea has more of rapid\ngaiety in breaking. The others may have higher diffs, or deeper valleys\ndown them, also (if they like to think so) darker woods for robbers'\nnests--but our own land has a sweetness, and a gentle liking for us, and\na motherly pleasure in its bosom when we do come home to it, such as no\nother land may claim--according to my experience.\n\nThese were my sentiments as I climbed, upon the ensuing Sunday, a lofty\nhill near the Ilfracombe road, commanding a view of the Bristol Channel\nand the Welsh coast beyond it. The day was so clear that I could follow\nthe stretches and curves of my native shore, from the low lands of Gower\naway in the west through the sandy ridges of Aberavon and the grey rocks\nof Sker and Porthcawl, as far as the eastern cliffs of Dunraven and the\nfading bend of St Donat's.\n\nThe sea between us looked so calm, and softly touched with shaded lights\nand gentle variations, also in unruffled beauty so fostering and\nbenevolent, that the white sailed coasters seemed to be babies fast\nasleep on their mother's lap.\n\n\"How long is this mere river to keep me from my people at home?\" I\ncried; \"it looks as if one could jump it almost! A child in a\ncockleshell could cross it.\"\n\nAt these words of my own, a sudden thought, which had never occurred\nbefore, struck me so that my brain seemed to buzz.\n\nBut presently reason came to my aid; and I said, \"No, no; it is out of\nthe question; without even a thread of sail! I must not let these clods\nlaugh at me for such a wild idea. And the name in the stern of the boat\nas well, downright 'Santa Lucia!' Chowne must have drowned those two\npoor children, and then rehearsed this farce of a burial with the\nCaptain's hat on, to enable his man to swear truly to it. Tush, I am not\nin my dotage yet. I can see the force of everything.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nA BRAVE MAN RUNS AWAY.\n\n\nIt may be the power of honesty, or it may be strength of character\ncoupled with a more than usual brightness of sagacity--but whatever the\ncause may be, the result seems always to be the same, in spite of inborn\nhumility--to wit, that poor old Davy Llewellyn, wherever his ups and\ndowns may throw him, always has to take the lead! This necessity, as\nusual, seemed to be arising now at Narnton Court--the very last place in\nthe world where one could have desired it. Since the present grand war\nbegan (with the finest promise of lasting, because nobody knows any\ncause for it, so that it must be a law of nature), I have not found much\noccasion to dwell upon common inland incidents. These are in nature so\nfar below all maritime proceedings, that a sailor is tempted to forget\nsuch trifles as people are doing ashore.\n\nEven upon Holy Scripture (since the stirring times began for me\nhenceforth to chronicle), it has not been my good-luck to be able to sit\nand think of anything. Nevertheless I am almost sure that it must have\nbeen an active man of the name of Nehemiah, who drew for his rations\nevery day, one fat ox, and six choice sheep, and fowls of order various.\n\nAll of these might I have claimed, if my capacity had been equal to this\ngreat occasion. Hence it may be well supposed that the kitchen was my\nfavourite place, whenever I deigned to enter into converse with the\nservants. At first the head-cook was a little shy; but I put her soon at\nher ease by describing (from my vast breadth of experience) the proper\nmanner to truss and roast a man--and still better a woman. The knowledge\nI displayed upon a thing so far above her level, coupled with my tales\nof what we sailors did in consequence, led this excellent creature so to\nappreciate my character, and thirst for more of my narratives, that I\nnever could come amiss, even at dishing-up time.\n\nBut here I fell into a snare, as every seaman is sure to do when he\nrelaxes his mind too much in the charms of female society. Not\nconcerning the cook herself--for I gave her to understand at the outset\nthat I was not a marrying man, and she (possessing a husband somewhere)\nresolved not to hanker after me--but by means of a fair young maid,\nnewly apprenticed to our head-cook, although of a loftier origin.\n\nMore than once, while telling my stories, I had obtained a little\nglimpse of long bright ringlets flashing and of shy young eyes just\npeeping through the hatch of the scullery-door, where the huckaback\ntowel hung down from the roller. And then, on detection, there used to\nensue a very quick fumbling of small red hands, as if being dried with a\ndesperate haste in the old jack-towel; and then a short sigh, and light\nfeet retiring.\n\nWhen this had happened for three or four times, I gave my head-cook a\nsudden wink, and sprang through the scullery-door and caught the little\nred hands in the fold of the towel, and brought forth the owner, in\nspite of deep blushes, and even a little scream or two. Then I placed\nher in a chair behind the jack-chains, and continued my harrowing\ndescription of the way I was larded for roasting once; by a score of\nunclothed Gabooners. Also how the skewers of bar-wood thrust in to make\nme of a good rich colour, when I should come to table, had not that\ntenacity which our English wood is gifted with; so that I was enabled to\nshake (after praying to God for assistance) my right arm out, and then\nmy left; and after clapping both together (to restore circulation), it\ncame providentially into my head to lay hold of the spit and charge\nthem. And then ensued such a scene as I could not even think of laying\nbefore young and delicate females.\n\nThis young girl, whoso name was \"Polly,\" always (at this pitch of\nterror) not only shivered but shuddered so, and needed support for her\nfigure beyond the power of stays to communicate, also let such tears\nbegin to betray themselves and then retreat, and then come out and defy\nthe world, with a brave sob at their back almost,--that I do not\nexaggerate in saying how many times I had the pleasure of roasting\nmyself for the sake of them.\n\nHowever it always does turn out that pleasures of this sort are\ntransient; and I could not have been going on with Polly more than ten\ndays at the utmost, when I found myself in a rare scrape, to be sure.\nAnd this was the worse, because Sir Philip so strongly desired my\npresence now, perhaps in the vain hope of my convincing that obstinate\nSquire of his brother's innocence, when that brother should return.\n\nNow I need not have spoken as yet of Miss Polly if she had been but a\ncommon servant, because in that case her peace of mind would have been\nof no consequence to the household. But, as it happened, she was a\nperson of no small importance, by reason of the very lofty nature of her\nconnections: for she was no less than genuine niece to the\nlady-housekeeper Mrs Cockhanterbury herself. And hence she became the\ninnocent cause of my departure from Narnton Court, before I had time to\nbegin my inquiries about the two poor little children.\n\nThis I had made up my mind to do, as soon as that strange idea had\ncrossed it, while I was gazing upon the sea; and my meaning was to go\nthrough all the traces that might still be found of them, and the mode\nof their disappearance. It is true that this resolve was weakened by a\ntempest which arose that very same evening after the Channel had looked\nso insignificant, and which might have been expected after that\nappearance. Nevertheless I must have proceeded according to my\nintention, if my heart had not been too much for me in the matter of\nPolly Cockhanterbury.\n\nBeing just now in my sixtieth year, I could not prove such a coxcomb, of\ncourse, as to imagine that a pretty girl of two-and-twenty could care\nfor me, so that no course remained open to me as an honourable man and\ngallant British officer who studies his own peace of mind, except to\nwithdraw from this too tempting neighbourhood.\n\nAnd in this resolution I was confirmed by Mrs Cockhanterbury's\nreluctance to declare in a binding manner her intentions towards her\nniece. Also by finding that somehow or other the whole of the\nground-floor at Narnton Court had taken it into their heads to regard me\nas a man of desirable substance. It is possible that in larger moments,\nwhen other people were boasting, I may have insisted a little too much\nupon my position as landowner in the parish of Newton Nottage. Also I\nmay have described too warmly my patronage of the schoolmaster, and\ninvestment of cash with a view to encourage the literature of the\nparish. But I never could have said--what all of them deposed to--such a\nvery strong untruth, as to convey the conclusion (even to a Devonshire\nstate of mind), that Colonel Lougher and I divided the whole of the\nparish between us!\n\nBe that as it may, there was not any maid over thirty who failed to set\nher cap at me, and my silver hair was quite restored to a youthful tinge\nof gold. Hence I was horrified at the thought that Polly might even\nconsent to have me for the sake of my property, and upon discovering its\npoetical existence, lead me a perfectly wretched life, as bad as that of\npoor Heaviside.\n\nSo that, in spite of all attractions, and really serious business,\nand the important duty of awaiting the Captain's return from Pomeroy\nCastle, and even in spite of Jerry Toms' offer to take Polly off my\nhands--as if she would say a word to him!--and all the adjurations of\npoor Heaviside, who had defied his wife (all the time I was there to\nback him up), and now must have to pay out for it--what did I do but\nagree to doff my uniform, and work my passage on board the Majestic, a\nfore-and-aft-rigged limestone boat of forty-eight tons and a half? Of\ncourse she was bound on the usual business of stealing the good Colonel\nLougher's rocks, but I distinctly stipulated to have nothing to do with\nthat.\n\nMy popularity now was such, with all ranks of society, also I found\nmyself pledged for so many stories that same evening, that I imparted to\nnone except Sir Philip, and Polly, and Jerry Toms, and Heaviside, and\none or two more, the scheme of my sudden departure. My mind was on the\npoint of changing when I beheld sweet Polly's tears, until I felt that I\nmust behave, at my time of life, as her father would; because she had no\nfather.\n\nWhen I brought the Majestic into shallow water off the Tuskar, every\ninch of which I knew, it was no small comfort to me that I could not\nsee the shore. For years I had longed to see that shore, and dreamed of\nit perpetually, while tossing ten thousand miles away; and now I was\nglad to have it covered with the twilight fogginess. It suited me better\nto land at night, only because my landing would not be such as I was\nentitled to. And every one knows how the Navy and Army drop in public\nestimation, when the wars seem to be done with. Therefore I expected\nlittle; and I give you my word that I got still less.\n\nIt may have been over eleven o'clock, but at any rate nothing to call\nvery late, just at the crest of the summer-time, when I gave three good\nstrong raps at the door of my own cottage, knowing exactly where the\nknots were. I had not met a single soul to know me, or to speak my name,\nalthough the moon was a quarter old, and I found a broken spar, and bore\nit as I used to bear my fishing-pole.\n\nNo man who has not been long a-roving can understand all the fluttering\nways of a man's heart when he comes home again. How he looks at every\none of all the old houses he knows so well; at first as if he feared it\nfor having another piece built on, or grander people inside of it. And\nthen upon finding this fear vain, he is almost ready to beg its pardon\nfor not having looked at it such a long time. It is not in him to say a\nword to, or even about, the children coming out thus to stare at him.\nAll the children he used to know are gone to day's work long ago; and\nthe new ones would scarcely trust him so as to suck a foreign lollipop.\nHe knows them by their mothers; but he cannot use their names to them.\n\nThere is nothing solid dwelling for a poor man long away, except the big\ntrees that lay hold upon the ground in earnest, and the tomb-stones\nkeeping up his right to the parish churchyard. Along the wall of this I\nglanced, with joy to keep outside of it; while I struck, for the third\ntime strongly, at not being let into mine own house.\n\nAt last a weak and faltering step sounded in my little room, and then a\nvoice came through the latch-hole, \"Man of noise, how dare you thus? you\nwill wake up our young lady.\"\n\n\"Master Roger, let me in. Know you not your own landlord?\"\n\nThe learned schoolmaster was so astonished that he could scarcely draw\nback the bolt. \"Is it so? Is it so indeed? I thank the Lord for sending\nthee,\" was all he could say, while he stood there shaking both my hands\nto the very utmost that his slender palms could compass.\n\n\"Friend Llewellyn,\" he whispered at last, \"I beg thy pardon heartily,\nfor having been so rude to thee. But it is such a business to hush the\nyoung lady; and if she once wakes she talks all the night long. I fear\nthat her mind is almost too active for a maid of her tender years.\"\n\n\"What young lady do you mean?\" I asked; \"is Bunny become a young lady\nnow?\"\n\n\"Bunny!\" he cried, with no small contempt; then perceiving how rude this\nwas to me, began casting about for apologies.\n\n\"Never mind that,\" I said; \"only tell me who this wonderful young lady\nis.\"\n\n\"Miss Andalusia, the 'Maid of Sker,' as every one now begins to call\nher. There is no other young lady in the neighbourhood to my knowledge.\"\n\n\"Nor in the whole world for you, I should say, by the look of your eyes,\nMaster Roger Berkrolles. Nevertheless put your coat on, my friend, and\ngive your old landlord a bit to eat. I trow that the whole of my house\ndoes not belong even to Miss Delushy. Have I not even a granddaughter?\"\n\n\"To be sure, and a very fine damsel she is, ay, and a good and comely\none; though she hath no turn for erudition. What we should do without\nBunny I know not. She is a most rare young housewife.\"\n\nThe tears sprang into my eyes at this, as I thought of her poor\ngrandmother, and I gave Master Berkrolles' hand a squeeze which brought\nsome into his as well.\n\n\"Let me see her,\" was all I said; \"it is not easy to break her rest,\nunless she is greatly altered.\"\n\n\"She is not in bed; she is singing her young friend to sleep. I will\ncall her presently.\"\n\nThis was rather more, however, than even my patience could endure: so I\nwent quietly up the stairs, and pushing the door of the best room\ngently, there I heard a pretty voice, and saw a very pretty sight. In a\nlittle bed which seemed almost to shine with cleanliness, there lay a\nyoung girl fast asleep, but lying in such a way that none who had ever\nseen could doubt of her. That is to say, with one knee up, and the foot\nof the other leg thrown back, and showing through the bed-clothes, as if\nshe were running a race in sleep. And yet with the back laid flat, and\nsinking into the pillow deeply; while a pair of little restless arms\ncame out and strayed on the coverlet. Her full and lively red lips were\nparted, as if she wanted to have a snore, also her little nose well up,\nand the rounding of the tender cheeks untrimmed to the maiden oval. Down\nupon these dark lashes hung, fluttering with the pulse of sleep; while\nheavy clusters of curly hair, dishevelled upon the pillow, framed the\ngentle curve of the forehead and smiling daintiness of the whole.\n\nNear this delicate creature sate, in a bending attitude of protection, a\nstrong and well-made girl, with black hair, jet-black eyes, and a rosy\ncolour spread upon a round plump face. She was smiling as she watched\nthe effect of an old Welsh air which she had been singing--\"Ar hyd y\nnos.\" To look at her size and figure, you would say that her age was\nfourteen at least; but I knew that she was but twelve years old, as she\nhappened to be our Bunny.\n\nYou may suppose that this child was amazed to see her old Granny again\nonce more, and hardly able to recognise him, except by his voice, and\neyes, and manner, and a sort of way about him such as only relations\nhave. For really, if I must tell the truth, the great roundness of the\nworld had taken such a strong effect upon me, that I had not been able\nto manage one straight line towards Newton Nottage for something over\nsix years now. Perhaps I have said that the Admiralty did not encourage\nour correspondence; and most of us were very well content to allow our\ndear friends to think of us. So that by my pay alone could my native\nparish argue whether I were alive or dead.\n\nIt would not become me to enter into the public rejoicing upon the\nmorrow, after my well-accustomed face was proved to be genuine at the\n\"Jolly.\" There are moments that pass our very clearest perception, and\njudgment, and even our strength to go through them again. And it was too\nearly yet--except for a man from low latitudes--to call for\nrum-and-water. The whole of this I let them know, while capable of\nreceiving it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nTRIPLE EDUCATION.\n\n\nMaster Roger Berkrolles had proved himself a schoolmaster of the very\ndriest honesty. This expression, upon afterthought, I beg to use\nexpressly. My own honesty is of a truly unusual and choice character;\nand I have not found, say a dozen men, fit anyhow to approach it. But\nthere is always a sense of humour, and a view of honour, wagging in\namong my principles to such an extent that they never get dry, as the\nmultiplication-table does. Master Berkrolles was a man of too much mind\nfor joking.\n\nTherefore, upon the very first morning after my return, and even before\nour breakfast-time, he poured me out such a lot of coin as I never did\nhope to see, himself regarding them as no more than so many shells of\nthe sea to count. All these he had saved from my pay in a manner wholly\nbeyond my imagination, because, though I love to make money of people, I\nsoon let them make it of me again. And this was my instinct now; but\nRoger laid his thin hand on the heap most gravely, and through his\nspectacles watched me softly, so that I could not be wroth with him.\n\n\"Friend Llewellyn, I crave your pardon. All this money is lawfully\nyours; neither have I, or anybody, the right to meddle with it. But I\nbeg you to consider what occasions may arise for some of these coins\nhereafter. Also, if it should please the Lord to call me away while you\nare at sea, what might become of the dear child Bunny, without this\nmammon to procure her friends? Would you have her, like poor Andalusia,\ndependent upon charity?\"\n\n\"Hush!\" I whispered; too late, however, for there stood Bardie herself,\na slim, light-footed, and graceful child, about ten years old just then,\nI think. Her dress of slate-coloured stuff was the very plainest of the\nplain, and made by hands more familiar with the needle than the\nscissors. No ornament, or even change of colour, was she decked with,\nnot so much as a white crimped frill for the fringes of hair to dance\nupon. No child that came to the well (so long as she possessed a mother)\never happened to be dressed in this denying manner. But two girls\nblessed with good stepmothers, having children of their own, were\nindued, as was known already, with dresses cut from the self-same\nremnant. Now, as she looked at Roger Berkrolles with a steadfast wonder,\nnot appearing for the moment to remember me at all, a deep spring of\nindefinite sadness filled her dark grey eyes with tears.\n\n\"Charity!\" she said at last: \"if you please, sir, what is charity?\"\n\n\"Charity, my dear, is kindness; the natural kindness of good people.\"\n\n\"Is it what begins at home, sir; as they say in the copy books?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear; but it never stops there. It is a most beautiful thing.\nIt does good to everybody. You heard me say, my dear child, that you are\ndependent on charity. It is through no fault of your own, remember; but\nby the will of God. You need not be ashamed to depend on the kindness of\ngood people.\"\n\nHer eyes shone, for a moment, with bright gratitude towards him for\nreconciling her with her pride; and then being shy at my presence\nperhaps, she turned away, just as she used to do, and said to herself\nvery softly--\"I would rather have a home though--I would rather have a\nhome, and a father and mother of my own, instead of beautiful charity.\"\n\nMaster Berkrolles told me, when she was gone, that many children of the\nplace had no better manners than to be always shouting after her, when\ncoming back from the sandhills, \"Where's your father? Where's your\nmother? Where's your home, Delushy?\"\n\nThis, of course, was grievous to her, and should never have been done;\nand I let Roger know that his business was to stop any scandal of this\nkind. But he declared that really the whole of his mind was taken up,\nand much of his body also, in maintaining rule and reason through the\nproper hours. After school-time it was not the place of the\nschoolmaster, but of the parson of the parish, or by deputy\nchurchwardens, or failing them the clerk, and (if he were out of the\nway) the sexton, to impress a certain tone of duty on the young ones.\nEspecially the sexton need not even call his wife to help, if he would\nbut have the wit to cultivate more young thoughtfulness, by digging a\ngrave every other day, and trusting the Lord for orders.\n\nIt was not long before Delushy learned some memory of me, partly with\nthe aid of Bunny, partly through the ship I made--such as no other\nman could turn out--partly through my uniform, and the rest of it by\nmeans of goodness only can tell what. A man who is knocked about, all\nover rounds, and flats, and sides of mountains, also kicked into and out\nof every hole and corner, and the strong and weak places of the earth,\nand upset after all the most by his fellow-creatures' doings, although\nhe may have started with more principle than was good for him, comes\nhome, in the end, to look at results far more than causes.\n\nThis was exactly mine own case. I can hardly state it more clearly. I\nwanted no praise from anybody; because I felt it due to me. A fellow who\ndoubts about himself may value approbation; and such was the case with\nme, perhaps, while misunderstood by the magistrates. But now all the\nmoney which I had saved, under stewardship of Berkrolles, enabled all my\nhousehold to stand up and challenge calumny.\n\nThere is a depth of tender feeling in the hearts of Welshmen, such as\ncannot anywhere else be discovered by a Welshman. Heartily we love to\nfind man or woman of our own kin (even at the utmost nip of the calipers\nof pedigree) doing anything which reflects a spark of glory on us. Of\nthis man, or woman even, we make all the very utmost, to the extremest\npoint where truth assuages patriotism. The whole of our neighbourhood\ntook this matter from a proper point of view, and sent me such an\ninvitation to a public dinner, that I was obliged to show them all the\ncorners of the road, when the stupid fellows thought it safer to conduct\nme home again.\n\nUpon that festive occasion, also, Sandy Macraw took a great deal too\nmuch, so entirely in honour of me that I felt the deepest goodwill\ntowards him before the evening was over, even going so far, it appears,\nas to discharge him from all backrent for the use of my little frigate.\nI certainly could not remember such an excess of generosity, upon the\nfollowing morning; until he pulled off his hat and showed me the\nfollowing document inscribed with a pencil on the lining: \"Dearest and\nbest of friends,--After the glorious tribute paid by the generous\nScotchman to the humble but warm-hearted Cambrian, the latter would be\nbelow contempt if he took a penny from him. Signed DAVID LLEWELLYN;\nwitness Rees Hopkins, chairman, his mark.\"\n\nAfter this, and the public manner of my execution, there was nothing to\nbe said, except that Sandy Macraw was below contempt for turning to\ninferior use the flow of our finest feelings. Therefore I went, with\nsome indignation, to resume possession of my poor boat, which might as\nwell have been Sandy's own, during the last five years and more.\nHowever, I could not deny that the Scotchman had kept his part of the\ncontract well, for my boat was beautifully clean and in excellent\nrepair; in a word, as good as new almost. So I put Miss Delushy on board\nof her, with Bunny for the lady's-maid, and finding a strong ebb under\nus, I paddled away towards Sker and landed bravely at Pool Tavan.\n\nFor poor Black Evan lay now in our churchyard by the side of his live\nbold sons, having beheld the white horse as plainly as any of the\nCoroner's jury. The reason was clear enough to all who know anything of\nmedicine, to wit, his unwise and pernicious step in prostituting his\nconstitution to the use of water.\n\nIf any unfortunate man is harassed with such want of self-respect, and\nutter distrust of Providence, as well as unpleasancy of behaviour\ntowards all worthy neighbours, and black ingratitude to his life, as to\nmake a vow for ever never to drink any good stuff again, that man must\nbe pitied largely; but let no one speak harshly of him; because he must\nso soon be dead. And this in half the needful time, if formerly he went\non too much.\n\nPoor Moxy now, with young Watkin only, carried on this desert farm. It\nwas said that no farmer, ever since the Abbots were turned out, could\ncontrive to get on at Sker. One after the other failed to get a return\nfor the money sunk into the desolate sandy soil. Black Evan's father\ntook the place with a quarter of a bushel heaped with golden guineas of\nQueen Anne. And very bravely he began, but nothing ever came of it,\nexcept that he hanged himself at last, and left his son to go on with\nit. What chance was there now for Moxy, with no money, and one son only,\nand a far better heart than head?\n\nNevertheless she would not hear for one moment of such a thing as giving\nup Delushy. This little maid had a way of her own of winding herself\ninto people's hearts, given to her by the Lord Himself, to make up for\nhard dealings. Moxy loved her almost as much as her own son Watkin, and\nwas brought with the greatest trouble to consent to lose her often, for\nthe sake of learning. Because there never could be at Sker the smallest\nchance of growing strongly into education. And everybody felt that\nBardie was of a birth and nature such as demanded this thing highly.\n\nHowever, even this public sentiment might have ended in talk alone, if\nLady Bluett had not borne in mind her solemn pledge to me. Roger\nBerkrolles would have done his best, of course, to see to it; but his\nauthority in the parish hung for a while upon female tongues, which\nforced him to be most cautious. So that I, though seven years absent, am\nbeyond doubt entitled to the credit of this child's scholarship. I had\nseen the very beginning of it, as I must have said long ago, but what\nwas that compared with all that happened in my absence? Berkrolles was a\nmighty scholar (knowing every book almost that ever in reason ought to\nhave been indited or indicted), and his calm opinion was, that \"he never\nhad led into letters such a mind as Bardie's!\"\n\nShe learned more in a week almost, than all the rising generation sucked\nin for the quarter. Not a bit of milching knowledge could he gently\noffer her, ere she dragged the whole of it out of his crop, like a young\npigeon feeding. And sometimes she would put such questions that he could\ndo nothing more than cover both his eyes up!\n\nAll such things are well enough for people who forget how much the body\ndoes outweigh the mind, being meant, of course, to do so, getting more\nfood, as it does, and able to enjoy it more, by reason of less\ndaintiness. But for my part, I have always found it human prudence to\nprevent the mind, or soul, or other parts invisible, from conspiracy to\noutgo, what I can see, and feel, and manage, and be punished for not\nheeding--that is to say, my body.\n\nNow the plan arranged for Bardie was the most perfect that could be\nimagined, springing from the will of Providence, and therefore far\nsuperior to any human invention. Master Berkrolles told me that a human\nbeing may be supposed to consist principally of three parts--the body,\nwhich is chiefly water (this I could not bear to hear of, unless it were\nsalt water, which he said might be the case with me); the mind, which\nmay be formed of air, if it is formed of anything; and the soul, which\nis strong spirit, and for that reason keeps the longest.\n\nAccordingly this homeless maiden's time was so divided, that her three\nparts were provided for, one after other, most beautifully. She made her\nrounds, with her little bag, from Sker to Candleston Court, and thence\nto Master Berkrolles at my cottage, and back again to Sker, when Moxy\ncould not do without her. She would spend, perhaps, a fortnight at\nCandleston, then a fortnight in Newton village, and after that a month\nat Sker, more or less, as might be, according to the weather and the\nchances of conveyance.\n\nAt Candleston, of course, she got the best of bodily food as well; but\nLady Bluett made a point of attending especially to her soul, not in a\nsanctimonious way, but concerning grace, and manners, and the love of\nmusic, and the handling of a knife and fork, and all the thousand little\nthings depending on that part of us. And here she was made a most\nperfect pet, and wore very beautiful clothes, and so on; but left them\nall behind, and went as plain as a nun to Newton, as soon as the time\narrived for giving her mind its proper training.\n\nNow when her mind was ready to burst with the piles of learning stored\nin it, and she could not sleep at night without being hushed by means of\nsinging, Moxy would come from Sker to fetch her, and scold both the\nMaster and Bunny well, for the paleness of Delushy's face, and end by\nbegging their pardon and bearing the child away triumphantly, with\nWatkin to carry the bag for her.\n\nAnd then for a month there was play, and sea-air, and rocks to climb\nover, and sandhills, and rabbits and wild-fowl to watch by the hour, and\nbathing throughout the summer-time, and nothing but very plain food at\nregular intervals of fine appetite.\n\nSo the over-active mind sank back to its due repose, and the tender\ncheeks recovered, with kind Nature's nursing, all the bloom the flowers\nhave, because they think of nothing. Also the lightsome feet returned,\nand the native grace of movement, and the enjoyment of good runs, and\nlaughter unrepressed but made harmonious by discipline. And then the\nhair came into gloss, and the eyes to depths of brightness, and all the\nmysteries of wisdom soon were tickled out of her.\n\nThis was the life she had been leading, now for some six years or more;\nand being of a happy nature, she was quite contented. In the boat I did\nmy utmost, that day, to examine her as to all her recollections of her\nearly history. But she seemed to dwell upon nothing now, except the most\ntrifling incidents, such as a crab lifting up the cover one day when Old\nDavy was boiling him, or \"Dutch\" being found with a lot of small\nDutches, and nobody knew where they came from. She had no recollection\nof any boat, or even a Coroner's inquest; and as to papa, and mama, and\nbrother--she put her hand up to her beautiful forehead, to think, and\nthen wondered about them.\n\nHaving cleverly brought you thus to a proper acquaintance with the\npresent situation, I really think that you must excuse me from going\ninto all Moxy's transports, called forth by the sight of me.\n\nIn spite of all that, I always say in depreciation of myself (ay, and\noften mean it too), nobody can have failed to gather that my countrymen\nat large, and (which matters more) my countrywomen, take a most kind\nview of me. And it would have been hard indeed if Moxy could not find a\ntear or two. And Watkin now was a fine young fellow, turned of twenty\nsome time ago, straight as an arrow, and swift as a bird, but shy as a\ntrout in a mountain-stream. From a humble distance he admired Miss\nDelushy profoundly, and was ever at her beck and call; so that of course\nshe liked him much, but entertained a feminine contempt for such a\nfellow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII.\n\nGREAT MARCH OF INTELLECT.\n\n\nNow I come to larger actions, and the rise of great events, and the\nmovements of mankind, enough to make their mother earth tremble, and\ntake them for suicides, and even grudge her bosom for their naked\nburial. Often had I longed for war, not from love of slaughter, but\nbecause it is so good for us. It calls out the strength of a man from\nhis heart, into the swing of his legs and arms, and fills him with his\nduty to the land that is his mother; and scatters far away small things,\nand shows beyond dispute God's wisdom, when He made us male and female.\n\nThe fair sex (after long peace) always want to take the lead of us,\nhaving rash faith in their quicker vigour of words and temper. But they\nprove their goodness always, coming down to their work at once, when the\nblood flows, and the bones are split into small splinters, and a man\ndies bravely in their arms, through doing his duty to them.\n\nBut though war is good, no doubt (till men shall be too good for it),\nthere was not one man as yet in Great Britain, who would have gone of\nhis own accord into the grand and endless war at this time impending.\nMaster Roger Berkrolles told me that throughout all history (every in\nand out of which he knew, while pretending otherwise) never had been\nknown such war, and destruction of God's men, as might now be looked\nfor. He said that it was no question now of nation against nation, such\nas may be fought out and done with, after rapid victory; neither a piece\nof mere covetousness for a small advance of dominion; nor even a contest\nof dynasties, which might prove the tougher one. But that it was\nuniversal clash; half of mankind imbittered to a deadly pitch with the\nother half; and that now no peace could be, till one side was crushed\nunder.\n\nThese things were beyond my grasp of widest comprehension, neither could\nI desire a war, begun about nothing, anyhow. If the Frenchmen insulted\nour flag, or wanted back some of their islands, or kept us from\nexamining their customs (when imported), no true Briton could hesitate\nto keep his priming ready.\n\nBut at present they were only plucking up courage to affront us, being\nengrossed with their own looseness, and broad spread of idiocy. For they\neven went the length of declaring all men to be equal, the whole world\ncommon property, and the very names of the months all wrong! After this\nit was natural, and one might say the only sensible thing they ever did,\nto deny the existence of their Maker. For it could hardly be argued that\nthe Almighty ever did lay hand to such a lot of scoundrels.\n\nNow if these rats of the bilge-hole had chosen to cock their tails in\ntheir dirt, and devour one another, pleasure alone need have been the\nfeeling of the human race looking down at them. But the worst of it was\nthat real men, and women, far above them, took up their filthy tricks\nand antics, and their little buck-jumps, and allowed their judgment so\nto be taken with grimaces--even as a man who mocks a fit may fall into\nit--that in every country there were \"sympathisers with the great and\nglorious march of intellect.\"\n\nIn Devonshire, I had heard none of all this, for none of the servants\never set eyes, or desired to do so, on \"public journals.\" They had heard\nof these, but believed them to be very dangerous and wicked things; also\ndevoid of interest, for what was the good of knowing things which\nanybody else might know?[E]\n\nAnd even if they had taken trouble ever to hear of the great outbreak,\nthey would have replied (until it led to recruiting in their own\nparish), \"Thiccy be no consarn to we.\"\n\nBut in our enlightened neighbourhood things were very different. There\nhad long been down among us ever so many large-minded fellows, anxious\nto advance mankind, by great jumps, towards perfection. And in this they\nshowed their wisdom (being all young bachelors) to strive to catch the\ngolden age before they got rheumatics.\n\nHowever, to men whose life has been touched with the proper grey and\nbrown of earth, all these bright ideas seemed a baseless dance of\nrainbows. Man's perfection was a thing we had not found in this world;\nand being by divine wisdom weaned from human pride concerning it, we\ncould be well content to wait our inevitable opportunity for seeking it\nin the other world. We had found this world wag slowly; sometimes\nbetter, and sometimes worse, pretty much according to the way in which\nit treated us. Neither had we yet perceived, in the generation newly\nbreeched, any grand advance, but rather a very poor backsliding, from\nwhat we were at their time of life. We all like a strong fellow when we\nsee him; and we all like a very bright child, who leaps through our\nmisty sense of childhood. To either of these an average chap knocks\nunder, when quite sure of it. And yet, in our parish, there was but one\nof the one sort, and one of the other. Bardie, of course, of the new\ngeneration; and old Davy of the elder. It vexes me to tell the truth so.\nBut how can I help it, unless I spoil my story?\n\nEver so many people got a meeting in the chapel up, to sign a paper, and\nto say that nobody could guess the mischief done by all except\nthemselves. They scouted the French Revolution as the direct work of the\ndevil; and in the very next sentence vowed it the work of the seventh\nangel, to shatter the Church of England. They came with this rubbish for\nme to sign; and I signed it (and some of them also) with my\nwell-attested toe and heel.\n\nAfter such a demonstration, any man of candid mind falls back on\nhimself, to judge if he may have been too forcible. But I could not see\nmy way to any cross-road of repentance; and when I found what good I had\ndone, I wished that I had kicked harder. By doing so, I might have\nquenched a pestilential doctrine; as every orthodox person told me, when\nthey heard how the fellows ran. But--as my bad luck always conquers--I\nhad but a pair of worn-out pumps on, and the only toe which a man can\ntrust (through his own defects of discipline) happened to be in hospital\nnow, and short of spring and flavour. Nevertheless some good was done.\nFor Parson Lougher not only praised me, but in his generous manner\nprovided a new pair of shoes for me, to kick harder, if again so\nvisited. And the news of these prevented them.\n\nBut even the way these fellows had to rub themselves was not enough to\nstop the spreading of low opinions; for the strength of my manifestation\nwas impressive rather than permanent. Also all the lower lot of\nNonconformists and schismatics ran with their tongues out, like mad\ndogs, all over the country raving, snapping at every good gentleman's\nheels, and yelping that the seventh vial was open, and the seventh seal\nbroken. To argue with a gale of wind would show more sense than to try\ndiscussion with such a set of ninnies; and when I asked them to\nreconcile their admiration of atheism with their religious fervour, one\nof them answered bravely that he would rather worship the Goddess of\nReason than the God of the Church of England.\n\nHowever, the followers of John Wesley, and all the respectable\nMethodists, scouted these ribalds as much as we did; and even Hezekiah\nhad the sense to find himself going too far with them, and to repair the\nseventh seal, and clap it on Hepzibah's mouth. For how could he sell a\nclock, if time was declared by the trumpet to be no more?\n\nAmid this universal turmoil, uproar, and upheaving, I received a letter\nfrom Captain Bampfylde, very short, and without a word of thanks for\nwhat I had done for him, but saying that he was just appointed to the\nBellona, 74, carrying 6 carronades on the poop; that she was fitting now\nat Chatham, and in two months' time would be at Spithead, where he was\nto man her. He believed that the greater part of the fine ship's company\nof the Thetis would be only too glad to sail under him, and he was\nenabled to offer me the master's berth, if I saw fit. He said that he\nknew my efficiency, but would not have ventured to take this step but\nfor what I had told him about my thorough acquirement of navigation\nunder the care of a learned man. After saying that if I reported myself\nat Narnton Court by the end of October he would have me cared for and\nsent on, he concluded with these stirring words:--\n\n\"There is a great war near at hand; our country will want every man,\nyoung or old, who can fight a gun.\"\n\nThese last words fixed my resolve. I had not been very well treated,\nperhaps; at any rate, my abilities had not been recognised too highly,\nlest they should have to be paid for with a little handsomeness. But a\nman of large mind allows for this, feeling that the world, of course,\nwould gladly have him at half-price. But when it came to talking of the\nproper style to fight a gun, how could I give way to any small\nconsiderations?\n\nFuzzy and Ike were stealing rock at this particular period in a new\nketch called the Devil (wholly in honour of Parson Chowne); and through\nthese worthy fellows, and Bang (now the most trustworthy of all), I sent\na letter to Narnton Court, accepting the mastership of his Majesty's\nship of the line, Bellona.\n\nNow everybody in earnest began to call me \"Captain Llewellyn\"--not at my\nown instigation, but in spite of all done to the contrary. The master of\na ship must be the captain, they argued, obstinately; and my well-known\nmodesty had the blame of all that I urged against it. But I need not say\nany more about it; because the war has gone on so long, and so many\nseamen have now been killed, that the nation has been stirred up to\nlearn almost a little about us.\n\nWhile I was dwelling on all these subjects, who should appear but Miss\nDelushy, newly delivered from Candleston Court, on her round of high\neducation? And to my amazement, who but Lieutenant Bluett delivered her?\nI had not even heard that he was come home; so much does a man, when he\nrises in life, fail in proper wakefulness! But now he leaped down from\nthe forecastle, and with a grave and most excellent courtesy, and his\nbright uniform very rich and noble, and his face outdoing it, forth he\nled this little lady, who was clad in simple grey. She descended quite\nas if it was the proper thing to do; and then she turned and kissed the\ntips of her fingers to him gracefully. And she was not yet eleven years\nold! How can we be amazed at any revolutions after this?\n\n\"Bardie!\" I cried, with some indignation, as if she were growing beyond\nmy control; and she stood on the spring of her toes exactly as she had\ndone when two years old, and offered her bright lips for a kiss, to\nprove that she was not arrogant. None but a surly bear could refuse her;\nstill my feelings were deeply hurt, that other people should take\nadvantage of my being from home so much, to wean the affections of this\ndarling from her own old Davy, and perhaps to set up a claim for her.\n\nBerkrolles knew what my rights were; and finding him such a quiet man,\nI gave it to him thoroughly well, before I went to bed that night. I let\nhim know that his staying there depended wholly upon myself; not only as\nhis landlord, but as holding such a position now in Newton, and Nottage,\nand miles around, that the lifting of my finger would leave him without\na scholar or a crust. Also I wished him to know that he must not, as a\nwretched landsman, take any liberties with me, because I had allowed him\ngratis to impart to me the vagueness of what he called \"Mathematics,\" in\nthe question of navigation. Of that queer science I made out some; but\nthe rest went from me, through the clearness of my brain (which let\nthings pass through it); otherwise I would have paid him gladly, if he\nhad earned it. But he said (or I may myself have said, to suggest some\nsense to him) that my brain was now too full of experience for\nexperiments. And of all the knowledge put into me by this good man\ncarefully, and I may say laboriously, I could not call to mind a letter,\nfigure, stroke, or even sign, when I led the British fleet into action,\nat the battle of the Nile. Nevertheless, it may all have been there,\nsteadily underlying all, coming through great moments, like a quiet\nperspiration.\n\nBut if I could not take much learning, here was some one else who could;\nand there could be no finer sight for lovers of education than to watch\nold Mr Berkrolles and his pupil entering into the very pith of\neverything. I could not perceive any cause for excitement, in a dull\nmatter of this sort; nevertheless they seemed to manage to get stirred\nup about it. For when they came to any depth of mystery for fathoming,\nit was beautiful to behold the long white hair and the short brown curls\ndancing together over it. That good old Roger was so clever in every\nstyle of teaching, that he often feigned not to know a thing of the\nsimplest order to him; so that his pupil might work it out, and have a\nbit of triumph over him. He knew that nothing puts such speed into\nlittle folk and their steps--be they of mind or body--as to run a race\nwith grown-up people, whether nurse or tutor.\n\nBut in spite of all these brilliant beams of knowledge now shed over\nher, our poor Bardie was held fast in an awkward cleft of conscience. I\nmay not have fully contrived to show that this little creature was as\nquick of conscience as myself almost; although, of course, in a smaller\nway, and without proper sense of proportions. But there was enough of it\nleft to make her sigh very heavily, lest she might have gone too far in\none way or the other. Her meaning had been, from her earliest years, to\nmarry, or be married. She had promised me through my grey whiskers often\n(with two years to teach her her own mind), never, as long as she lived,\nto accept any one but old Davy. We had settled it ever so many times,\nwhile she sate upon my shoulder; and she smacked me every now and then,\nto prove that she meant matrimony. Now, when I called to her mind all\nthis, she said that I was an old stupid, and she meant to do just what\nshe liked; though admitting that everybody wanted her. And after a\nlittle thought she told me, crossing her legs (in the true old style),\nand laying down her lashes, that her uncertainty lay between Master\nRoger and Mr Bluett. She had promised them both, she did believe,\nwithout proper time to think of it; and could she marry them both,\nbecause the one was so young and the other so old? I laid before her\nthat the proper middle age of matrimony could not be attained in this\nway; though in the present upside-down of the world it might come to be\nthought of. And then she ran away and danced (exactly as she used to\ndo), and came back with her merry laugh to argue the point again with\nme.\n\nBefore I set off for Narnton Court, on my way to join the Bellona,\nLieutenant Bluett engaged my boat and my services, both with oar and\nnet, for a day's whole pleasure off shore and on. I asked how many he\nmeant to take, for the craft was a very light one; but he answered, \"As\nmany as ever he chose, for he hoped that two officers of the Royal Navy\nknew better than to swamp a boat in a dead calm such as this was.\" My\nself-respect derived such comfort from his outspoken and gallant way of\ncalling me a brother officer (as well as from the most delicate air of\nignorance which he displayed when I took up a two-guinea piece which\nhappened to have come through my roof at this moment perhaps, or at any\nrate somehow to be lying in an old tobacco-box on my table), that I\ndeclared my boat and self at his command entirely.\n\nWe had a very pleasant party, and not so many as to endanger us, if the\nladies showed good sense. Colonel Lougher and Lady Bluett, also the\nlieutenant, of course, and a young lady staying at Candleston Court, and\ndoing her utmost to entrap the youthful sailor--her name has quite\nescaped me--also Delushy, and myself. These were all, or would have been\nall, if Master Rodney had not chanced, as we marched away from my\ncottage, with two men carrying hampers, to espy, in the corner of the\nold well, a face so sad, and eyes so black, that they pierced his happy\nand genial heart.\n\n\"I'll give it to you, you sly minx,\" I cried, \"for an impudent, brazen\ntrick like this. What orders did I give you, Miss? A master of a ship of\nthe line, and not master of his own grandchild!\"\n\nThe young lieutenant laughed so that the rushes on the sandhills shook,\nfor he saw in a moment all the meaning of this most outrageous trick.\nBunny, forgetting her grade in life, had been crying, ever since she\nawoke, at receiving no invitation to this great festivity. She had even\nshown ill-will and jealousy towards Bardie, and a want of proper\nsubmission to her inevitable rank in the world. I perceived that these\nvile emotions grew entirely from the demagogic spirit of the period,\nwhich must be taken in hand at once. Wherefore I boxed her ears with\nvigour, and locked her into an empty cupboard, there to wait for our\nreturn, with a junk of bread and a cheese-rind. However, she made her\nway out, as her father had done with the prison of Dunkirk; and here she\nwas in spite of all manners, good faith, and discipline.\n\n\"Let her come; she deserves to come; she shall come,\" Master Rodney\ncried; and as all the others said the same, I was forced to give in to\nit; and upon the whole I was proud perhaps of our Bunny's resolution.\nNeither did it turn out ill, but rather a good luck for us, because the\nyoung lady who wooed the lieutenant proved her entire unfitness for a\nmaritime alliance, by wanting, before we had long been afloat, although\nthe sea was as smooth as a duck-pond, some one to attend upon her.\n\nEvery one knows what the Tuskar Rock is, and the caves under Southern\nDown; neither am I at all of a nature to dwell upon eating and drinking.\nAnd though all these were of lofty order, and I made a fire of\nwreck-wood (just to broil some collops of a sewin, who came from the\nwater into it, through a revival of my old skill; and to do a few\noysters in their shells, with their gravy sputtering, to let us know\nwhen they were done, and to call for a bit of butter), no small\nconsiderations, or most grateful memories of flavour could have\nwhispered to me twice, thus to try my mouth with waterings over such a\ncookery. But I have two reasons for enlarging on this happy day; and\nthese two would be four at once, if any one contradicted them.\n\nMy chief reason is that poor dear Bardie first obtained a pure\nknowledge of her desolate state upon that occasion;--at least so far as\nwe can guess what works inside the little chips of skulls that we call\nbabyish. Everybody had spoiled her so (being taken with her lovingness,\nand real newness of going on, and power to look into things, together\nwith such a turn for play as never can be satiated in a world like ours;\nnot to mention heaps of things which you must see to understand), let me\nnot overdo it now, in saying that this little dear had taken such good\neducation, through my liberal management, as to long to know a little\nmore about herself, if possible.\n\nThis is a very legitimate wish, and deserving of more encouragement than\nmost of us care to give to it; because so many of us are not the waifs\nand strays, and salvage only, but the dead shipwrecks of ourselves;\ncontent with the bottom of the great deep, only if no shallow fellows\nshall come diving down for us.\n\nHaving the joy of sun and sea, and the gratitude for a most lovely\ndinner, such as none could take from me, I happened to lie on my oars\nand think, while all my passengers roved on the rock. They were astray\nupon bladder-weed, pop-weed, dellusk, oar-weed, ribbons, frills, kelp,\nwrack, or five-tails--anything you like to call them, without falling\nover them. My orders were to stand off and on, till the gentry had\namused themselves. Only I must look alive; for the Tuskar rock would be\ntwo fathoms under water, in about four hours, at a mile and a half from\nthe nearest land.\n\nThe sunset wanted not so much as a glance of sea to answer it, but lay\nhovering quietly, and fading beneath the dark brows of the cliffs; which\ndo sometimes glorify, and sometimes so discourage it. The meaning of the\nweather and the arrangement of the sky and sea, was not to make a show\nfor once, but to let the sunset gently glide into the twilight, and the\ntwilight take its time for melting into starlight. This I never thus\nhave watched except in our old island.\n\nThere was not a wave to be seen or felt, only the glassy heave of the\ntide lifted my boat every now and then, or lapped among the wrinkles of\nthe rocks, and spread their fringes. Not a sound was in the air, and on\nthe water nothing, except the little tinkling softness of the drops that\nfeathered off from my suspended oar-blades.\n\nFloating round a corner thus, I came upon a sight as gently sad as sky\nand sea were. A little maid was leaning on a shelf of stone with her\nhair dishevelled as the kelp it mingled with. Her plain brown hat was\ncast aside, and her clasped hands hid her face, while her slender feet\nhung down, and scarcely cared to paddle in the water that embraced them.\nNow and then a quiet sob, in harmony with the evening tide, showed that\nthe storm of grief was over, but the calm of deep sorrow abiding.\n\n\"What is the matter, my pretty dear?\" I asked, after landing, and\ncoaxing her. \"Tell old Davy; Captain David will see the whole of it put\nto rights.\"\n\n\"It cannot be put to yights,\" she answered, being even now unable to\npronounce the _r_ aright, although it was rather a lisp than any clear\nsound that supplied its place; \"it never can be put to yights: when the\nother children had fathers and mothers, God left me outside of them; and\nthe young lady says that I must not aspiya ever to marry a gentleman. I\nam ony fit for Watkin, or Tommy-Toms, or nobody! Old Dyo, why did I\nnever have a father or a mother?\"\n\n\"My dear, you had plenty of both,\" I replied; \"but they were\nshipwrecked, and so were you. Only before the storm came on, you were\nput into this boat somehow, nobody living can tell how, and the boat\ncame safe, though the ship was wrecked.\"\n\n\"This boat!\" she cried, spreading out her hands to touch it upon either\nside--for by this time I had shipped her--\"was it this boat saved me?\"\n\n\"Yes, you beauty of the world. Now tell me what that wicked girl had the\nimpudence to say to you.\"\n\nThis I need not here set down. Enough that it flowed from jealousy,\njealousy of the lowest order, caused by the way in which Lieutenant\nRodney played with Bardie. This of course interfered with the lady's\nchances of spreading nets for him, so that soon she lost her temper,\nfell upon Delushy, and upbraided her for being no more than an utterly\nunknown castaway.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII.\n\nBEATING UP FOR THE NAVY.\n\n\nMy other reason for setting down some short account of that evening was\nto give you a little peace, and sense of gratitude to the Lord, for our\nmany quiet sunsets, and the tranquillity of our shores. It really seems\nas if no other land was blest as ours is, with quiet orderly folk inside\nit, and good rulers over it, and around it not too much of sun or moon,\nor anything, unless it may be, now and then, a little bit of cloudiness.\nAnd this love of our country seems ever to be strongest, whether at\ndeparting for the wars with turbulent nations, or upon returning home,\nas soon as we have conquered them. But now for a long time, I shall have\nvery little peace to dwell upon.\n\nAt Narnton Court I found no solace for my warmth of feeling. Polly had\nbeen sent out of the way, on purpose, because I was coming; which was a\nmost unhandsome thing on the part of Mrs Cockhanterbury. For the very\nexpectation which had buoyed me up at a flattish period, and induced me\nto do without three quids of cross-cut negrohead, was my simple and\nhumble looking forward to my Polly. I knew that I was a fool, of course;\nbut still I could not help it; and I had got on so well among young\nwomen always, that I found it very hard to miss the only chance I cared\nfor. I feared that my age was beginning to tell; for often, since I had\nbeen ashore, my rheumatics had come back again. Neither was that my only\ngrief and source of trouble at this time; but many other matters quite\nas grave combined against me. Heaviside was not there to talk, and make\nme hug my singleness; nor even Jerry Toms, nor the cook, who used to let\nme teach her. It was not that all these had left the place for any\nmischief. In an ancient household such a loss is not allowable. All\nmeant to come back again, when it suited their opportunities, and each\nperceived that the house was sure to go to the dogs in the absence of\nthemselves and one another. Heaviside had found Nanette (in spite of my\nbest prognostics) overget her seventh occasion of producing small\nCrappos, and his natural disappointment with her led to such words that\nhe shouldered his bundle and made off for Spithead, in company with\nJerry, who was compelled to forsake his creditors. And as for the cook,\nI did hear, though unable to believe it, that she was in trouble about a\nyoung fellow scarcely worthy to turn her jack.\n\nIn other respects I found that nothing of much importance had occurred\nsince I was there in the summer-time. Sir Philip continued to trust in\nthe Lord, and the Squire to watch the sunsets; neither had the latter\nbeen persuaded to absolve his brother. The Captain had been at home one\nor two days, inquiring into my discovery of the buried dolls. He did\nnot attach so much importance to this matter as his father had done, but\nsaid that it made a mysterious question even more mysterious. And\nfailing, as a blunt sailor would, to make either head or tail of it, and\nbeing disgusted with his brother for refusing to see him, he vowed to\nremain in the house no longer, but set off for Pomeroy Castle again,\nwhere he had formed a close friendship with the eldest son of the owner.\nHis lady-love, the fair Isabel, was not living there now, but might very\neasily be met with; for on coming of age three years ago, she had taken\npossession of her domain, \"Carey Park,\" a magnificent place adjoining\nthe Pomeroy property. It was said that the Earl had done his best to\ncatch the young heiress for his son, and therefore had made a pretext of\nthe old charge against the Captain, for the purpose of putting a stop to\ncommunication with him. But his son, Lord Mohun, upon finding how the\nyoung lady's heart was settled, withdrew his suit (like a man of\nhonour), and all the more promptly, perhaps, because he had made up his\nmind to another lady before Miss Carey came to them.\n\nIt was said that the Captain might now have persuaded the beautiful\nheiress to marry him, and finish their long affection, if he could have\nthoroughly made up his mind that honour would bear him out in it. For\nher confidence was so perfect in him, that she left it to his own\njudgment, herself perhaps longing to put an end to their wearisome\nuncertainty. Sir Philip heard of it, and came down, to implore them thus\nto settle themselves. And Captain Bampfylde was so hard set by the\nnature of the case, that he might have been enticed away from what his\nconscience told him. This was that the solemn oath which he had taken in\nthe church, with Isabel beside him, to purge himself of all foul charges\n(ere he made another guilty, if himself were guilty), could not thus be\nlaid aside without a loss of honour. Sir Philip would be the last man in\nthe world to counsel dishonest actions; but being an old man, and\nreluctant that his race should all expire, he looked upon that sacrament\nas no more than a piece of sacrilege, or a hasty pledge of which the\nLord would never take advantage.\n\nNobody knows what might have happened with Captain Bampfylde so beset,\nand longing to think that he ought to act as everybody told him: but he\nbegged for a night to think over it; and in the morning he received his\nappointment to the Bellona. Even Sir Philip could not deny that the\nhand and the will of the Almighty must herein be recognised. And there\nwas a chance of a brush with Spain, about the Nootka Sound, just then;\nand if anything makes a sailor's fortune, it is a fight with these fine\nold Dons. A Frenchman is sure to be captured, but not half so sure as a\nSpaniard; and the hidalgoes do turn out good gold, with good manners\nbehind it. Many ships have I boarded, but with brightest alacrity always\na good fat old Spaniard.\n\nTherefore the Captain brushed away any little weakness, and set out for\nSpithead bravely, in a bachelor condition. And after trying to collect\nwhat news there was at Narnton, and finding that I must not think of\nmeeting my dear Polly, I quietly drew my travelling-money, and set forth\nto join him.\n\nOnly every one will reproach me, and have right to do so, if I fail to\ntell the latest tidings of that Parson Chowne. People seemed to like\nthis man, because they never could make him out, and nearly all the\nworld is pleased to hear of the rest being vanquished. It seems that a\nwholly new bishop arose, by reason of the other dying, and this\ngentleman swore on the Bible to have things in order. When he heard of\nChowne, and his high defiance of all former bishops, he said, \"Fie, fie!\nthis must not be; I will very soon put this to rights.\" To follow up\nthis resolution he appointed Tiverton, and the old church of St Peter,\nfor Chowne to bring his young people up to a noble confirmation; also\nfor a visitation of the clergy all around; such as they have now and\nthen, to stop the spread of king's evil.\n\nHis holiness the Bishop was surprised to receive this answer: \"My dear\nLord,--My meet is at Calverly on the day you speak of. We always find a\nfox hard by; and if he should make for Stoodleigh coverts, I may come\ndown the Bolham road in time to meet your Lordship. At any rate, I shall\ndine at 'The Angel,' somewhere between three and five o'clock, and hope\nto find you there, and have a pleasant evening with you.--Yours very\ntruly, R. S. CHOWNE.\n\n\"_P.S._--If you bring your two Archdeacons, we will have a rubber: but I\nnever go beyond guinea points.\"\n\nThe whole of this was written with Cumberland lead, on the back of a\npaper, showing how to treat hounds in distemper; and the Bishop was\ndispleased about it, and declined his society; especially as he had\ninvitation to the good Tidcombe Rectory. And there he was treated so\nhospitably by a very handsome family, that he put up his glass of a\nnoble wine, and saw the sun set through it, and vowed that his Magna\nCharta, or Habeas Corpus, or Writ of Error--I never can remember\nwhich--but at any rate that his royal orders should fall out of his\napron-pocket, if he failed to execute them.\n\nIn this state of mind he received a letter from Parson Chowne himself,\nfull of respect, and most cleverly turned, as well as describing the\nParson's grief at being unable to bring to his holiness any one fit to\nlay hands upon. The standard set before them had been (before laying on\nof hands) to say the Lord's Prayer backwards; and there was not one of\nthem up to it. This angered the Bishop to such a degree, that he ordered\nout his heavy coach with the six long-tailed black horses, and the\ncoachman with cocked-hat and flowing wig, and four great footmen\nshouldering blunderbusses; himself sate inside with his crosier and\nmitre, and lawn sleeves, and all the rest of it. Now this was just the\nvery thing the refractory Parson expected; therefore he rode round\novernight and bade every farmer in the neighbourhood send all his hands\nwith pickaxes and shovels, by four o'clock the next morning: also he\ngathered all his own men there, as well as the unclad folk who were\nentirely at his orders. Then he sent for Parson Jack, as being the\nstrongest man about there, and imparted his intention to him, and placed\nhim over the workmen.\n\nEarly in the afternoon the Bishop's state-carriage was descried moving\nup the Tiverton highroad, with a noble and imposing aspect. Before he\narrived at the cross-road leading off to Nympton Rectory, his Lordship\nwas surprised to see a great collection of people standing on a hill\nabove the road, and all saluting him with the deepest respect. \"Not so\nbad after all,\" he exclaimed; \"brother Chowne has brought his men into\ngood order, which is the noblest use of the Church. Ah! they don't see a\nbishop every day, and they know when a thing is worth looking at, for\ntheir faces are black with astonishment. Holloa, Bob! what's that?\"\n\n\"Up with the glass, your Lordship,\" the coachman shouted back; \"or it\nwill be all over with you. We are in a damned slough, and no mistake.\"\n\nAnd so they were. His Lordship had no time to slam the windows up,\nbefore the coach lay wallowing in a bog of nighty blackness. In it\npoured, and filled the coach, and nearly smothered his Lordship, who was\ndragged out at last with the greatest trouble, as black as if he were\ndipped in pitch. For the Parson had done a most shameful thing, and too\nbad for even him to think of. He had taken up his private road, and dug\nout the ground some six feet deep, and then (by means of carts and\nharrows) transferred to it the contents of a quagmire, which lay handy,\nand spread the surface again with road-dirt, so that it looked as sound\nas a rock. Having seen with a telescope from his window the grand\nsuccess of his engineering, he sent down a groom in smart livery, to\npresent his compliments to the traveller who had happened to lose his\nway, and fall into a moor-hole, and was there anything he could do to\nmitigate that misfortune? But the Bishop sputtered out through his\nchattering teeth that he hoped to hear no more of him, and that none but\na Devonshire man was fit to oversee Devonshire parsons. And this made\nthe fifth bishop conquered by Chowne.\n\nTo return to our noble selves--that is to say, to the better people\ndealt with in our history. At the close of this year 1790, to wit, upon\nChristmas-day of that excellent year of grace, no less than three of us\ndined together (of course, with a good many others also) in the\nCaptain's cabin of the Bellona, 74-gun ship of the British Navy,\ncarrying also six carronades. These three were, Captain Drake Bampfylde,\nof course, the Honourable Rodney Bluett, now our second lieutenant, and\nthe Master of the ship, whose name was something like \"David Llewellyn.\"\nThis latter was now remarkable for the dignity of his appearance and the\ngravity of his deportment; and although he was only ranked after the\nyoungest of the lieutenants, and just before chits of reefers (called by\nsome people \"midshipmen\"), and though upon any but festive occasions you\nmight not have spied him at the Captain's table, you could scarcely have\nfound any officer more satisfied with his position and more capable of\nmaintaining it.\n\nWe were cruising off the south coast of Ireland, under orders to search\nall ships that might be likely to carry arms; but as a frigate would\nhave done for that service, as well as, or better than, a 74, we knew\nthat our true commission was to shake together and fall into discipline,\nand bring other seamen into the same, if we could get any to join us.\nHaving a light wind and plenty of sea-room, we resolved to enjoy\nourselves that day; and a very delightful party it was, especially after\nI was called on to spin a few of the many true yarns which make me such\na general favourite.\n\nAfter filling our glasses and drinking the health of his Majesty, and of\nthe Navy at large, and especially of our Captain, we began to talk of\nthe state of affairs and the time at which the war might be expected to\ndeclare itself. That it must come to a great war with France, not even a\nfool could doubt, although he might desire to doubt it, ever since the\ndestruction of the Bastile in July 1789. And throughout all the year and\na half since that, a wild and desperate multitude had done nothing but\nabolish all the safeguards of their country, and every restraint upon\nthe vilest rabble. Our wisest plan was to begin at once, before this\ncruel monster should learn the use of its fangs and the strength of its\nspring; but, as usual, Great Britain was too slow to seize the cudgel,\nwhich might haply have saved a million lives. However, we were preparing\nquietly for the inevitable conflict, as even our presence that day in\nthe cabin of the Bellona might indicate.\n\n\"Master, we are sadly short of hands,\" said Captain Bampfylde,\naddressing me; \"I shall have a poor report to make, unless we do\nsomething. Do you think that we could get on without you, if I sent you\non a cruise for a week or so?\"\n\n\"I think you might, sir,\" I answered humbly; \"if it does not come on to\nblow, and if you keep well away from land. I have trained Mr Sebright\nwith so much skill, that you may always rely upon him, except in any\ndifficulty.\"\n\nNobly I spoke; and the Captain's reply was not very far behind me. \"If\nwe carried 750 men,\" he exclaimed, with generous candour, \"we could not\nhope to have more than one Master David Llewellyn; so diffident, so\ntruthful, so entirely free from jealousy. Gentlemen, is it not so?\"\n\nAll the officers assented with a pleasant smile to me, and then to one\nanother, so that I hardly knew what to say, except that I could not\ndeserve it.\n\n\"Our tender the Sealark is to meet us in the Cove of Cork on New Year's\nDay,\" continued Captain Bampfylde; \"and after shipping all our stores,\nshe will be for a fortnight at my disposal. Now you know as well as I\ndo, that our complement for war-time is 650 men and boys, and that our\npresent strength is more than 200 short of that. War may be declared any\nday almost, and a pretty figure we should cut against a French liner of\n80 guns. Therefore, unless the Sealark should bring us a very large\ndraft, which I do not expect, my resolve is to man and victual her, for\na fortnight's cruise, under some one who is a good hand at recruiting.\nWould you like the berth, Master Llewellyn?\"\n\n\"Sir, I know not anything which I should like better.\"\n\nOur Captain perceived that the junior lieutenants looked rather glum at\nbeing so passed over, from Master Rodney downwards; and though he had\nthe perfect right to appoint any officer he pleased, he knew the true\nwisdom of shunning offence, by giving some good reason. Therefore he\nwent on again:--\n\n\"There is not one of us, I daresay, who would not enjoy this little\nchange. But I think that Llewellyn is our man, simply for this reason.\nThe part to be beaten up first is the Welsh coast, from St David's Head\nto Penarth. I have heard of many good seamen there, and especially at\nLlanelly. I think that none of our officers can speak Welsh, except\nMaster David. Even you, Bluett, though coming from Wales, are not up to\nthe lingo.\"\n\nThis settled it in the best-natured manner; and all congratulated me,\nand wished me good speed in getting hold of old salts, if possible, or\nelse fresh young ones. Not to be too long about it, somewhere about\nEpiphany Day in the year 1791, I stretched away for the coast of Wales,\nbeing in command of the Sealark, a rattling cutter of 100 tons, with two\n6-pound bow-chasers, and a score of picked men under me. I have no time\nnow to describe emotions, even of the loftiest order, such as\npatriotism, modesty, generosity, self-abasement, and many others which I\nindulged in, when I cast anchor off Porthcawl, and they thought that I\nmeant to bombard them. I ordered a boat ashore at once, to reassure the\nnatives, when I had given a waft of my flag, and fired a gun to salute\nit. But being now in such a position, and the parish to its utmost\ncorners raving on the subject, ashore I durst not trust myself; because\nwithout rupture of ancient ties, and a low impression left behind, I\ncould not have got aboard sober again. And after that, could I knock\ndown any of my crew for being tipsy? Nevertheless, I had Bardie, and\nBunny, and Mother Jones with her children, and Master Berkrolles, and\nCharles Morgan, and Betsy Matthews, and Moxy Thomas, all brought in a\nboat to visit me, besides a few others who came without leave. They all\nseemed to be very well and happy, and I entertained them beautifully.\n\nThat same afternoon we made a hit enough to encourage anybody. We\nimpressed not only my foe the tailor, but also Hezekiah! That is to say,\nit was not quite what might be called impressment; because, with no war\nraging yet, we could not resort to violence: but we made them both so\nentirely drunk, that we were compelled, for their own sake, to weigh\nanchor while having their bodies on board. I had a stern fellow of noble\nmind to back me up at all hazard, and seeing what a sneak Hezekiah was,\nhe gave him six dozen out of hand, with my official sanction. The\nHorologist to the Royal Family took his allotment worse than almost any\nman I ever saw; however, for old acquaintance' sake, I would not have\nhim salted. In spite of this, the effect was such that it brought him\nround to the English Church, and cured him of all French doctrine. And\nas he gradually began to lose fat, and to dwell upon gunnery, we found\nhis oiliness most useful to prevent corrosion.\n\nHaving worked this coast to our utmost power, and gathered a good deal\nof human stuff (some useful and some useless), pretty near threescore in\nall, and put upon short rations, we thought that we might as well finish\nour job by slanting across to Devonshire. Because for the most part, you\nthere may find more body but less mind than ours, which is the proper\nstate of things for the substance of our Navy. Therefore we drafted off\nto Cork all our noble Welshmen, and made sail for Devonshire.\n\nNow, before telling what we did, I really must guard against any nasty\nmisconstruction. Whatever had been done to me on the part of Parson\nChowne, was by this time so wholly gone out of my heart, and mind, and\neverything any man can feel with, that nothing was further from my\nintention than to stir at all in that matter again. I knew that in spite\nof all the deference paid me now on every side (and too much for my\ncomfort), Chowne would turn me inside out, ten thousand times worse than\nStew could. This I like to see done, when anything wrong can be found\ninside a man. But a thoroughly honest fellow should stick on his\nhonesty, and refuse it.\n\nSo when Providence, in a dream, laid before me the great mercy, and I\nmight say miracle, of impressing the naked people, and bringing them\nunder our good chaplain, to be trained from the error of their ways and\nlive, I felt a sort of delicacy as to trespassing thus upon Parson\nChowne's old freehold.\n\nThese naked folk belonged to him, and though he did not cultivate them\nas another man might have done, it was not difficult to believe that he\nfound fine qualities in them. And to take them from under his very nose,\nmight seem like a narrow vexation. However, times there are when duty\noverrides all delicacy; the Bellona was still short of her number by a\nhundred hands or more: and with this reflection I cast away all further\nhesitation.\n\nWe left the Sealark off Heddon's Mouth, a wild and desolate part of the\ncoast, for my object was to pounce unawares on the Parson's savage\ncolony. For what we were going to do was not altogether lawful just at\npresent, although it very soon would be. My force consisted of no less\nthan fifteen jolly well-seasoned tars, all thoroughly armed, all up for\na spree, and ready to do any mortal thing at a word or a signal from me.\nIf we could only surprise the wild men, I had no fear as to our retreat,\nbecause the feeling of the country would be strongly in our favour, as\nthe abaters of a nuisance long pronounced unbearable.\n\nFor five or it may have been six leagues we marched across the moors as\nstraight as possible by compass, except when a quagmire or a ridge of\nrugged stone prevented us. We forded several beautiful streams of the\nbrightest crystal water, so full of trout that I longed to have a turn\nat my old calling; and we came in view of Nympton steeple just as the\nsun was setting. I remembered the lie of the land quite well, ever since\nthat night when the fire happened; so I halted my men in a little wood,\nand left them to eat their suppers, while I slung my spy-glass and\nproceeded to reconnoitre the enemy. Lying flat upon the crest of a\nhummocky ridge of moorland, I brought my glass to bear through the\nheather first upon the great Parson's house, which stood on a hill to\nthe left of me, and then on the barbarous settlement. The Rectory looked\nas snug and quiet as the house of the very best man could be; with a\ndeal more of comfort than most of these contrive to gather around them.\n\nThe dens of the tribe that objected to raiment were quite out of sight\nfrom his windows; nor were they allowed to present themselves to Mrs\nChowne, unless she had done anything to vex him. Shaping my glass upon\nthese wretches, I saw that they were in high festival. Of course I could\nnot tell the reason, but it turned out afterwards that the Parson's\nhounds were off their feed through a sudden attack of distemper, and\ntherefore a cartload of carrion had been taken down to the settlement.\nIt was lucky that I knew it not, for I doubt whether we should have\ndared to invade their burrows at such a period.\n\nHowever, I thought that nothing could be more suitable for our\nenterprise. Of course they would all overgorge themselves, and then\ntheir habit of drinking water, which alone would establish their\nbarbarism, was sure to throw them into deep untroubled sleep till\nsunrise. As soon as one could strike a line from the pointers to the\nPole-star (which is a crooked one, by the by), and as soon as it was\ndark enough for a man to count the Pleiads, I called my men with a long\nlow whistle, and advanced in double file. The savages lay as deeply\nsleeping as if their consciences were perfect, whereas they could have\nhad none at all. We entered their principal cuddy, or shanty, or\nshieling, or wigwam, or what you will (for it was none of these exactly,\nbut a mixture of them all), and to our surprise not one awoke, or was\ncivilised enough to snore. Higgledy-piggledy they lay in troughs scooped\nout of the side of the hill, or made by themselves, of clay and straw\n(called \"cob,\" I believe, in Devonshire), with some rotten thatch above\nthem, and the sides of their den made of brushwood. Some of the elders\nhad sheepskins over them, but the greater part trusted to one another\nfor warmth, and to their hairiness.\n\nAll this we saw by a blue-light which I ordered to be kindled--for at\nfirst it was as dark as pitch--and a stranger or a sadder sight has\nrarely been seen in England. Poor creatures! they were all so cowed by\nthe brilliant light and the armed men standing in their filthy hovel,\nthat they offered no resistance, but stared at us in a piteous manner,\nas if we were come to kill them. Escape was impossible, save for the\nchildren, and most of them thought (as we found out afterwards) that\nChowne was tired of them and had ordered their destruction.\n\n\"Choose all the males from ten years to thirty,\" I shouted to my men,\nwho were almost as scared as the savages: \"don't touch the females, or\nI'll cut you down. Set another blue-light burning: we don't want any\ncripples.\"\n\nNot to be too long with it, I only found three men worth impressing; the\nothers were so badly built, or even actually deformed, and of appearance\nso repulsive that we could not bear to think of turning them into\nmessmates.\n\n\"Now for the boys!\" I cried; \"we want boys even more then men almost;\"\nbut I found that all the children save one had slipped through the\nsailors' legs adroitly while we were dealing with the men. We could not\nhave caught them in the dark; and more than this, the best-sized of them\nhad popped, like snakes, into burrow-holes, or like a fox into his\nearth.\n\nBut the one who stood his ground, and faced us, was a noble-looking boy,\nin spite of dirt and nakedness, with long thick tangles of golden hair,\nand a forehead like a man's almost. He looked up at me in a bold steady\nmanner, wholly unlike their savage stare, and it struck me that here was\nthe little fellow whom I had saved eight or nine years ago from the\nhorse of Parson Jack. But though he appeared to be twelve years old, I\ncould not make out what he said, except \"Yes, yes;\" and \"me come with\noo.\" Such was his state of education!\n\nI hoisted him on a strong man's back, for the long march had made me\nfeel my years, and perceiving no call to molest the residue, or injure\ntheir home--such as it was--we simply handcuffed the three best fellows,\nand borrowed three pig-whips of their own (made right down ingeniously)\nso as to drive them to Heddon's Mouth. We durst not halt for a rest\nuntil there were three leagues between us and Nympton Moor; then\nhurrying on at the break of day, we found the Sealark at anchor; and she\nsent us a boat, at our signal.\n\nScarcely were we on board of the boat, and pushing off with our capture,\nwhen the clash of a horse's hoofs upon rock rang through the murmuring\nof the waves. We turned and gazed with one accord, for the boat lay\nbroadside on to shore, through the kicking of the naked men when they\nfelt salt water under them, and our quitting good stroke to attend to\nthem. At furious speed a horseman dashed out of the craggy glen, and\nleaped the pool where the brook is barred up and vanishes. Down the\nshingle, and shelves of wrack, he drove his horse into the sea, until\nthere was no firmness under him. He almost laid hold of our boat--not\nquite; for I struck with an oar at the horse, and scared him, shouting\nto all of my crew to pull.\n\nFinding himself just a little too late, Chowne gave a turn to his\nhorse's head, and the lather and foam of the spirited animal made a\nwhite curdle in the calm blue sea. The horse sprang gladly up the\nshingle crest--for the shore is very steep there--and he shook himself\nand scattered brine; and there were three other horses behind him. On\none of these sate Parson Jack, and two huntsmen on the other twain, and\nthe faces of these were as red as fire with hurry and indignation.\n\nOnly Chowne's wicked face was white, and settled with calm fury; and his\nstyle of address to us, just as if we were nothing but dogs of his\nkennel.\n\n\"Ho, you scoundrels!\" he shouted out, \"hold oars, and let me parley\nyou.\"\n\nAt this I made a signal to my crew to slack from rowing; and I stood up\nin the boat, and said, \"What can we do for your Reverence?\"\n\n\"Nothing for me, rogues; but much for yourselves. I will give you five\npounds for that child in the stern. I want him for knife-cleaning.\"\n\n\"Would your Worship think fifty too much for him? We put him at fifty,\nyour Worship.\"\n\n\"Fifty, you robbers! Well, then, fifty. Ten times his value to any one.\nBut I have a fancy for him.\"\n\n\"Would your Worship mind saying five hundred down? Look at his hair: he\nis worth it.\" For we had washed him in the brook; and his hair in drying\nwas full of gold.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he shouted, controlling himself, as his habit was, when\noutbreak became useless. For the dignity of my demeanour, and the\nnobility of my uniform, also the snowiness of my hair, combined to\ndefeat the unerring quickness of his rapid and yet cold eyes. And so I\nreplied with an elegant bow--\n\n\"Your Reverence, it so happens that my name is 'Old Davy Llewellyn.'\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV.\n\nTAMING OF THE SAVAGES.\n\n\nAfter a most successful cruise, we returned to our Bellona, and were\nreceived as behoves success, with ever so many rounds of cheers. It was\ntrue that we had sent before us, and now brought in, an awkward lot; but\nit is beautiful to see how in a large ship's company, and under a good\ncommander, mere coaster fellows become true seamen, and even\nland-lubbers learn how to walk. Captain Drake Bampfylde did me the\nhonour of asking my advice, as soon as his own opinion was settled; and\nI said no more than \"Bay of Biscay,\" which was his own opinion. Here the\nvery utmost of a noble sea awaited us, and none of our landsmen had any\nheart for fat, or even for lean stuff. We let them go on for a day,\nperpetually groaning, and after that we provided for each a gallon of\nsalt water, and gave it them through the ship's trumpet, until they\nentirely ceased from noise.\n\nThese prudent measures brought them into such a wholesome state of\nmind, that really a child might lead them, as by one of the prophets\nmentioned, when I read my Bible. All of our new hands, I mean, except\nHezekiah, and the three wild men.\n\nUnfortunate Master Perkins could not enter into the spirit of our\nexertions for his benefit; because his mind was unsettled with knowing\nthe hardship both of his back and front. For his back was covered with\nraw places sitting amiss to the fit of his clothes, while the forward\npart of his body became too hollow to yield him comfort. But, strange to\nsay, his wrath was kindled not against us for these misfortunes, but\nagainst his wife Hepzibah, because she had not predicted them. And for\nthe greater part of a week, the poor fellow lay in a perfect craze upon\nthe orlop-deck, while the ship was rolling heavily. Nothing could\npersuade him but that he was the prophet Jonah in the belly of the\nwhale, and he took the stowage of our cables for the whale's intestines.\nYou could hear him even from the main deck screaming at the top of his\nvoice, \"Wallow not, O whale! O whale! Lord, Thy servant repenteth, only\nlet not this whale wallow so.\" So that in spite of all his tricks,\nhypocrisy, pride, and gluttony, I could not help taking compassion upon\nhim, and having a hammock rigged tenderly for him, so that his empty and\nhelpless body fell into a deep sleep as long as the prophet himself\ncould have had it. For I never could show myself at Bridgend, if through\nmy means Hezekiah found the sea his churchyard. On the other hand, the\nthree wild men took their visitation from a wholly different point of\nview. They had never heard either of God or the devil, and could not\nbelieve themselves even worth the interference of either Power. For they\ndid not believe that their souls were immortal (as I suppose they must\nhave been), nor were they even aware of possessing anything more than a\nbody apiece. My own idea of treatment was, that to bring them into\nself-respect, we should flog the whole three very soundly, and\nhandsomely pickle them afterwards; nor could I see any finer method of\ncuring them of their hairiness. But Captain Bampfylde, who showed the\nstrangest interest in these savages, would on no account have them\nflogged until they gave occasion. He said that their ideas of justice\nmight be thrown into a crooked line, if the cat-and-nine-tails were\npromiscuously administered. Whereas I knew that the only way to make a\nman dwell upon justice is to give him a taste of the opposite. He values\nthe right after this, because he thinks there is none of it left upon\nearth.\n\nSo for the present these three \"Jack Cannibals,\" as our tars entitled\nthem, sate apart and messed apart--and a precious mess it was of it.\nThey soon got over the \"Marly Mary,\" as the Crappos call it; and we\ntaught them how to chew tobacco, which they did, and swallowed it. Only\ntheir fear of the waves was such that they could not look over the side\nof the ship, or even out of a porthole. After a few days we fell in with\npelting showers of hail and sleet, with a bitter gale from the\nnorth-north-west. I saw the beauty of this occasion to show mankind\ntheir need of clothes; therefore I roused up these three poor fellows,\nand had them thrown into a salting-tub full of ice-cold water. This made\ntheir teeth chatter bravely, and then we started them up the rigging,\nwith a taste of rope's end after them. They ran up the ratlines faster\nthan even our very best hands could follow them, because of the power\nstill left in their feet, through never having owned a shoemaker; but in\nthe main-top they pulled up, and the wind went shivering through them.\n\nMeanwhile I was sedately mounting (as my rank required now) with a very\nold pilot's coat, well worn out, hanging over my left arm.\n\n\"Here, Jack!\" I cried to the biggest one; \"take this, and throw it over\nyou, to keep your poor bones warm.\"\n\nThe sheaves of the blocks were white with snow (which they always seem\nto be first to take), and so were the cleats and the weather side of\ntopmast and top-gallant-mast. When you see this, you may make up your\nmind to have every rope frosted ere morning. Therefore Jack Cannibal\nlooked at the coat, and around it, as a monkey does.\n\n\"Put it on,\" I cried; \"poor fellow! put it on to cover you.\"\n\nHe nodded and laughed, as if I were making some joke which he ought to\nunderstand, and then he threw the warm coat round his body (now quite\nblue from cold), but without any perception of sleeves, or skirts, or\nanything else, except, as it were, like a bit of thatching. And after\nthat he helped us to civilise the rest; so that in course of time we had\nthem in decency far superior to the average show of Scotchmen. And in\nabout the same course of time, Cannibal Jack, I do assure you, became a\nvery good seaman, and a wonderfully honest fellow, without any lies in\nhim. And yet he said things better than the finest lies that could be\ntold, all coming out of his oddness, and his manner of taking tameness.\nAnd if a roaring sound of laughter came to the ears of an officer (such\nas never could be allowed in the discipline of war-time), the officer\nalways lifted lip, to have a smile accordingly, and said to himself, \"I\nshould like to know what Cannibal Jack has said to them.\"\n\nThe two other naked ones, Dick and Joe--as we christened them out of a\nbucket of tar, without meaning any harm to them--never could be entirely\ncured of their hereditary shortcomings. We taught them at last to wear\nclothes, by keeping a sharp leather strap always handy, against which\ntheir only protection was a good watch coat, or a piece of sailcloth; so\nthat after a great deal of pleasantry, we set the ship tailor to work\nfor them. But no possible amount of strap, nor even cat-and-nine-tails\nadministered by our boatswain's mate (a most noble hand at wielding it),\ncould prevail upon them to abandon their desire for the property of\ntheir messmates. They even had the arrogance, as their English grew more\nfluent, to attempt to reason it out with us.\n\n\"Father David,\" said Cannibal Dick, for they had agreed that now I was\ntheir patron, even as Chowne had been; \"you take the Crappo ship, the\nenemy you call it, and then you leave them all their goods, not touch\none of anything, and hand back the ship to him.\"\n\n\"Dick, none but a savage would talk such rubbish. We keep the ship, and\nall it holds, and put the men in prison.\"\n\n\"There for you now, there for you! And you beat us because we take not a\ngreat ship, but some little thing lying about in a ship, from our\nenemies.\"\n\n\"Will you never see things aright, Dick? We are not your enemies, we are\nyour friends; and to steal things from us is robbery.\"\n\n\"You call it friends to steal us from our place, and people, and warm\ndry sands, and put us on this strange great wetness, where no mushrooms\ngrow, and all we try to eat goes into it. And then you beat us, and\ndrive us up trees such as we never saw before, and force us to hide in\nthese dreadful things!\"\n\nHere he pointed to his breeches with a gaze of such hopeless misery,\nthat I felt it would be an unkind thing to press him with further\nargument. However, the boy was enough to make up for a far worse lot\nthan these were. We soaped him most powerfully, to begin with, even up\nto the skin of his eyelids, and he made no more objection than a\nChristian child might have offered. And after we had scraped him dry\nwith the rough side of a spencer, he came out bright, I do assure you,\nand was such a model figure that we said to one another that he had some\nright to go naked. For his skin was now as fair and soft as the opening\nout of a water-lily, while his golden curls spread out, like flowers of\nthe frogbit. Also his shoulders so nicely turned, and the slope of his\nsides so clever, with arms and legs of such elegant mould, being thick\nand thin in the proper places, and as straight as a well-grown parsnip;\nthen, again, his ankles clear, and feet of a character never beheld\nafter any shoemaking.\n\nOur common fellows made so much of this superior little chap, that I was\ncompelled to interfere, and show my resolution: and this required to be\ndone with some small sense of how to do it; otherwise the boy might take\nthe turn of sour grapes with them, and be bullied even more than he had\nbeen petted thitherto. Moreover, all the other boys in the ship were\nlonging to fight with him, which (as he was the smallest of all, and not\nbrought up in a Christian manner) would have afforded him no fair play\nfor his nice short nose, or his soft blue eyes. The little dear was as\nbrave as a lion, and ready to fight any one of them; and he used to\nstand up to my elbow, suing for permission. And now he began to talk so\nwell, that it was very hard upon him not to be allowed to fight a bit;\naccording to the natural issue of all honest converse. However, I would\nnot be persuaded, loving his pretty face as I did; and I fear that he\nhad unhappy times, through the wickedness of the other boys. Having a\nstronger sense of mistake than afforded me any happiness--in the thick\nof my rank and comforts--I could not find any ease until everything,\nlooked at anyhow, and from all bearings contemplated, lay before our\nCaptain. He thought, enough to look wise; and then, he said that really\nI was fit to see to such little things myself. He had heard of a small\nboy covered over with a great deal of yellow hair; this should have been\nfetched off long ago; and what was the barber kept for? Thus it always\ndoes befall me, to be thrown back, without guidance, on my own\nresources. And even Lieutenant Bluett, with whom I next went to hold\ncounsel, was more inclined to stretch and gape, after a heavy spell on\ndeck, than to bring his mind to bear upon this child's adventures.\n\n\"Send the poor little beggar in,\" he said, \"and let me look at him, if I\ncan keep my eyes open. Llewellyn, you always did love savages.\"\n\n\"Lieutenant, you would not like me to account you in the number.\"\n\n\"Davy, you might fairly do it, when I come off deck, like this. Send him\nin, ere I snooze, old fellow.\"\n\nThis I did; and when the boy entered, shyly putting one hand to his\nforelocks (as I had instructed him), a beam of the newly-risen sun broke\nin through a bull's eye, and made a golden frame for him. In the middle\nof this he looked so innocent and so comely, and at the same time so\nwell bred, that Master Rodney's sleepy eyes fell open with wonder at\nhim. This was my doing, of course, entirely. \"Soap and discipline\" is my\nsignal to the next generation; and nothing else can counteract all the\nheresies around us. Therefore this little boy's cheeks were brighter\nthan any rose, from towelling; and his beautiful eyes without speck of\ndirt; and the top of his head as sweet and curly as a feathering\nhyacinth.\n\nWhen I perceive that I have had the luck to make an impression my rule\nis to say nothing at all, but appear to be unaware of it. This rule is\nfounded on common-sense; and it took me so long to find it out, that it\nought to be worth something. Otherwise, what offence one gives! And not\nonly that, but consider how seldom the man who succeeds deserves it. Any\nmodest man, like me, upon any moderate success, is bound to examine\nhimself, and feel less confidence than he used to have. His success is\nenough to prove, according to the ways of the world, that he never can\nhave deserved it.\n\nThis remembrance led me now to abstain from even patting \"Harry\" (as we\nhad named this little fellow) on his golden head at all, lest I should\nmanifest undue pride in a creature of my creation. For such he was,\nbeyond all mistake; and it would have given me pleasure to back him for\na crown against any boy in our fleet, or any three in the whole French\nnavy; taking age, of course, and size, into consideration.\n\n\"What a fine little fellow!\" said Rodney Bluett; \"why, he ought to be a\nmidshipman. I had no idea your savages could turn out such young ones. I\nmust see what I can do for him, Davy. Only I can't think of anything\nnow.\"\n\nPerceiving that I was likely to do more harm than good by pressing the\nmatter just then, I took little Harry away with me, and found him quite\nfull of the young lieutenant's brave appearance and kindly smile. In a\nword, they were pleased with one another so heartily, and so lastingly,\nthat it was the luckiest day, perhaps, of poor little Harry's unlucky\ncareer, when I first commended him to the notice of the Honourable\nRodney.\n\nFor this latter was now not only a general favourite in the ship, but\nalso a great power; being our second luff, and twice as active as our\nfirst was. He took the boy under his special care, and taught him all\nsorts of ennobling things--how to read, and write, and spell, and clean\nboots, and wait at breakfast. So that I felt many qualms sometimes,\nquite apart from all narrow methods of regarding anything, and springing\nfrom the simple fear that the child might be spoiled for his station in\nlife, and fail to become a good seaman.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV.\n\nUPON FOREIGN SERVICE.\n\n\nAt length, when all sailors' hearts were sick with vain hopes of some\nenterprise, France did a truly bold thing by declaring war against Great\nBritain. Those people before this had given occasion for the strongest\nscandal, by taking their King and Queen in a dastardly manner, and\ncutting their heads off. Indignation and hot hatred ran throughout\nEngland and Wales, at the news; but our Government did no more than\npolitely request that the London agent of these cut-throats should\nwithdraw.\n\nNevertheless I cannot be wrong--as my pension comes from Government--in\nsaying that to my mind the British Government, at this noble crisis,\nbehaved in a most forbearing, prudent, Christian, generous, glorious,\nand magnanimous manner. They waited for war to be proclaimed by France,\nbefore they accepted it. And then they proved themselves as wholly\nunready as they ought to be. What finer state of feeling can be shown by\nany country?\n\nIt must have been either the end of February, or the early part of\nMarch, in the year of grace 1793, when we heard of this grand and\nmomentous affair. And I remember the date by this, that the onions were\nsprouted, and we were compelled to make shift with shallots. For calling\nat Falmouth to victual a little, we sent three boats ashore, and I of\ncourse was in command of one. And though we spread abroad and ransacked\nall the Cornish gardeners' hoards, and gave them a taste of boat-hooks,\nbecause they had no proper things, not an onion could we find, except\nwith a crooked thumb to it. Nor were the young ones yet fit to pull;\nand this fixes the date to a week or so.\n\nAnd now we found that the whole of us were to be turned over, while the\nBellona was refitting, to the 74-gun ship Defence, with orders for the\nWest Indies at once--as was generally believed--to protect our shipping\nand commerce there.\n\nFor although the war had been so very long looked forward to, our\nGovernment was not ready yet, but had to send squadrons right and left,\nto see to our foreign interests; while Portsmouth, Chatham, and even\nLondon, had very few ships to defend them. Our charity never begins at\nhome; as poor Bardie's did in her copy-book. However, it chanced to turn\nout all right, because the other side was quite as much abroad as we\nwere.\n\nSome of our men were inclined to grumble, at having barely a spree\nashore, when they longed for a turn at home again. But the Admiralty\nsettled that, by not paying their back-wages; which is the surest way of\nall for keeping a fellow well up to his work. His temptation for running\nis gone, because he has no cash to run with; neither do his people want\nhim while in that condition. This he knows well, and it makes him think;\nand nine times out of ten he resolves to double what is due to him, and\nreally pocket it when again due, and almost be admired by his own wife.\n\nTherefore most part of us tumbled over from the Bellona into the\nDefence, after some liberty ashore--which, for a godly man like me, was\nnothing more than a trial. Captain Drake Bampfylde worked harder than\neven Parson Chowne's horses were said to do; and as for me----but I\nwill not say, for it now becomes unbecoming. Enough that the Defence\ncleared outward of the No-man buoy, the very day three weeks from the\ndate of the Bellona standing inwards. We had the wind at E.N.E., as it\nalways is in spring-time.\n\nNow it may seem out of place, and even very rude on my part; but I could\nnot altogether help a strong desire to know how our Captain this time\nmanaged in the matter of the female sex. I had my own feelings towards\npoor young Polly, and a hankering to let her see me (which, however,\nmust not now be gratified on either side), and of course a man feels,\nwhen this is the case, that another man must be like him. However, the\nrules of the service forbade me to put any questions on private affairs\nto an officer thus set over me; and as for observing him, that was\nbelow me, even if time had availed for it. Heaviside also had shown such\nill feeling and even downright ingratitude towards me, simply because my\nposition and rank had compelled me to teach him his distance, which he\nwas somehow too stupid to learn (especially since his rash elevation,\nand appointment as our chief boatswain, which made it the more incumbent\nupon me to preserve a firm attitude); this fellow, I say, was so utterly\nwanting in that deference which the Master of a line-of-battle ship not\nonly has a right to expect, but is even bound to exact, that I could not\nnow approach him with inquiries about our Captain. And this became\ntenfold more painful, as soon as I saw that he knew something.\n\nWhat French sailors could have a chance with a fleet under Sir John\nJervis? I cannot tell how many islands we took, for we could not stop to\ncount them. We caught just the tail of the hurricane of the 12th and\n13th of August, which ever will be remembered as the most terrible ever\nknown. None of us had the luck to see the pine bulkhead blown through\nthe palm-tree, or the whole of a sugar-estate set down on the other side\nof the mountain; but a sailor asks credit for his stories, because he\nhas given it: and otherwise no tales can go on.\n\nI need not dwell on our victories here, except for the sake of Harry\nSavage, as we had dubbed the poor Nympton boy, for want of legitimate\nsurname. In one little skirmish ashore somewhere, I think in San\nDomingo, this little fellow, by genuine courage and unusual nimbleness,\nsaved the life of his friend and protector, our Lieutenant Bluett. For\nwhile the lieutenant was engaged, sword to sword, with one vile\nrepublican, another of yet more rampant nature made at him, as it were\nflankwise, and must have given him a bitter stab, if Harry had not with\na sudden jump grappled the rogue by the leg so tightly, that down he\ncame on his face with a curse, so far as their language enables them.\nAnd we were so enraged, I assure you, at the duplicity of this fellow,\nthat we borrowed a dirk from a little middy, and gave it to Harry to\nstick him with. But this our young savage refused to do, and turned\nquite pale at the thought of it, so that we placed that Equality man at\nthe mercy of the French Royalists, who were acting with us at that\nperiod: and these made very short work with him, as justice demanded\nwith a ringleader of pestilential principles.\n\nAlso, in a manner which true modesty forbids to dwell upon--because\nneither of us had clothes on--I saved the life, before very long, of our\nnew boatswain Heaviside. This worthy fellow was swimming along in his\nusual independent style, after kicking his good wife's shackles off,\nwhen I--having taken the inside of him, as his superior\nofficer--discovered a shark of unusual size desirous to swallow our\nboatswain. That this should never come to pass was my resolve\nimmediately, although I could not quite see how to be in time to stop\nit. For Heaviside, with his usual conceit, and desire to show himself\noff, was floating on his back, with arms laid square, and beard on\nbreast, and legs spread out like rolling-pins. And the shark at twenty\nknots an hour split the blue water towards him.\n\nAny man but myself would have given him over, or left all the rest to\nhelp him, especially after his utterly republican want of deference. To\nme, however, such want of sympathy was almost impossible, so that I swam\nwith all speed to Heaviside, where he lay floating grandly.\n\n\"Look there!\" I shouted; \"all up with you, Ben, unless you capitulate.\"\nAnd with these words, I pointed out the fin of the shark advancing.\nRoyal sharks we always called them, being the largest sharks in the\nworld, in and around Port Royal. Heaviside had his fat legs foremost,\nand the royal shark stopped to look at them.\n\n\"Will you or will you not?\" I asked, while preserving with some\ndifficulty a proper position behind him--for even a royal shark could\nhave wanted nothing more after Heaviside.\n\n\"Oh, Davy, Davy, I will,\" he answered; \"only, only save me.\"\n\nThe look which he gave was now enough to make me sink small questions,\nespecially as the poor fellow managed, being a first-rate swimmer, to\noffer me almost foremost to the jaws of the shark just opening.\nTherefore, as this latter creature rolled on his side to make at us,\nwhat did I do but a thing which none except a great fisherman could have\ndone? To wit, I plucked from its strings the boatswain's heavy periwig\n(which had often vexed me, on account of its pretension), and clapping\nit on a piece of sugar-cane, which lay floating handy, down the wide\njaws of the shark I thrust it, to improve his appetite.\n\nFaithless people may doubt my word, when solemnly I declare to them that\nthis great monster of the waters coughed and sneezed like a Christian.\nAnd we found him rolling dead the next morning, with this obstruction in\nhis throat. Thus by much caution and presence of mind, I saved our\nboatswain not only from the jaws of a shark, but from a far more fatal\nerror, arrogance and downright contumacy, which had made him refuse to\ntouch his hat to his superior officer. Now I need not have mentioned\nthis little affair, except that it bears upon my story, inasmuch as it\nreconciled Master and boatswain, and enabled them both to work together\nfor the benefit of their Captain. Among poor Heaviside's many weak\nqualities, one of the most conspicuous was a resolute curiosity. This\ncompelled him to open a great part of the breadth of his nature to the\nlegitimate, or otherwise, affairs of his fellow-creatures.\n\nAnd being an orthodox champion of wedlock (from the moment he left his\nwife and children, without any power to draw on him), he helped all the\nrest of the world in this way, as a host recommends his hot pickles.\n\nTherefore he had been chosen, by very bad taste upon somebody's part,\nand an utter forgetfulness of me, to be up at our Captain's snap of a\nwedding, and to say \"Amen\" to it. What could be worse than a huddle of\nthis kind, and a broad scattering afterwards? If they had only invited\nme, both sense and honesty would have been there; as well as a man not\nto be upset by things, however female.\n\nThat was their own concern, of course; and it misbecame me to think of\nit; and I saw, upon further consideration, that my sturdy honesty might\nnot quite have suited them. For women are able, with the help of men, to\nwork themselves up to anything. You may call them the shot and men the\npowder; or you may take quite another view, and regard them as the\npowder, with a superior man at the touchhole. Anyhow, off they go; and\nwho shall ask the reason?\n\nFor from what Heaviside told me, it seems that the Captain and his fair\nIsabel, before our present cruise began, had resolved that no one should\never be able legally to sever them. But one special term of the compact\nwas that the outer world should have no acquaintance with things that\nhappened between them. In other words, that they should leave their\nexcellent friends and relatives all in the dark about this matter, as\nwell as save the poor Captain's oath, by quitting each other\nimmediately. It is to the utmost extent beyond my own experience to\ndeny, that this is the wisest of all arrangements (if there can be\nanything wise) after the deed of wedlock; for what can equal severance\nin the saving of disagreement? However, they had not the wisdom as yet\nto look at it in this light, and the one wept and the other sighed, when\nthey parted at the churchyard gate; for the Defence must sail at 1 P.M.\nThe lady had been content to come and dwell in a very dirty village of\nthe name of Gosport, so that the licence might be forthcoming from\nproper people when paid for. Because, of course, in her own county,\nnothing could have been done without ten thousand people to talk of it.\nAnd thus they were spliced, without hoisting flag; for ever spliced,\nboth in soul and in law (which takes the lead of the other one), and yet\nin body severed always, till there should come fair repute.\n\nA common man of my rank in life, and having no more than common-sense,\nmust often find himself all abroad with wonder about his superiors. They\nseem to look at things as if everything and every person were looking\nback at them again, instead of trusting to the Lord to oversee the whole\nof it. If I had been of the proper age, and a lovely rich maid in love\nwith me, would I have stopped even twice to think what the world might\nsay about us? Heaviside's opinion was that the lady wished to hide\nnothing whatever, but proclaim before all people where and when, and\nwhom she wedded, and how proud she was of him. But the Captain, in his\nkind regard and tenderness for her feelings, durst not expose her to the\npain and sense of wrong which might ensue upon his name coming forward\nthus, with the county thinking as it did, and himself not there to\nvindicate. And of course he knew with what vigour and skill vile Parson\nChowne would set to at once to blacken his character, and to make his\nbride a most unhappy one. Therefore Sir Philip Bampfylde and the ancient\nEarl of Pomeroy were the only persons present of their rank and kindred;\nand both of these confessed the wisdom of the Captain's arguments.\n\nNow on the 30th of April 1794, at about the hour of sundown, our anchor\nwas scarcely beginning to bite in Cawsand Bay, when the barge of the old\nPort-Admiral was alongside of us. We had long been foregathering what we\nwould do as soon as we got ashore again; but now we could only shake\nheads and fear that the whole would be disappointment. And thus it\nproved, and even worse for many of our company, inasmuch as our orders\nwere to make sail at once for St Helens and there to join the Channel\nfleet under Admiral Lord Howe. Therefore we carried on again with a gale\nfrom south-west to favour us, and on the first of May we brought up in\nthe midst of a large society.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nEXILES OF SOCIETY.\n\n\nA finer sight was never seen than we had now around us; for all the\nconvoy was come together, as well as the British fleet empowered to\nprotect them. I stood in our foretop and counted 152 large sail, nearly\n50 of which were men-of-war, and all the rest goodly merchantmen. A\nsight like this not only strengthens a Briton's faith in Providence, but\nputs him into a quiet pride concerning his King and country.\n\nWe had scarcely swung to our moorings ere we had signal from the\nAdmiral, \"Not a man to be allowed ashore. Water and victual all night,\nand be ready to weigh again at daybreak.\" Of course we did so, though a\nhard thing upon us; and new hands desired to grumble, until Captain\nBampfylde rigged the gratings. Heaviside now was known to have such a\nswing of arm, with a flick to it, never being satisfied with his mate's\nadministration, that never a man of patriotic sentiments encroached on\nhim. We all determined to sail once more, and let the French see what\nour nature was (although they might hope to find it spoiled, by our\nbeing away from home so much); especially when we heard that they had\n350 sail or more of merchantmen coming home, all very rich, and fattened\nup for capture. What we wanted, therefore, was to see our own good\ntraders free from any chance of piracy, and at the same time to stop\nthose French from wicked importations. If in both points we might\nsucceed, and give battle afterwards, our gratitude to the Lord would\nalmost equal our own glory. And we heard that the mob in Paris would\nstarve, failing of all this American fleet.\n\nOn the 2d of May the wind fetched back to its proper place at that time\nof year, north-north-east, with snow-clouds always ready to endorse it;\nand thus we slipped from our moorings and went quietly down Channel.\nConcerning the rest, we have no cause to plead for man's indulgence.\nThe Lord continued to baffle us, and would not give us any help to close\nquarters with the enemy. We fought three days of rolling battle, ending\non the 1st of June, after two days of fog interrupting, and not a breath\nof sleep four nights. Every one says that we fought very well, having\neverything so much against us, and the French fleet far superior,\ncarrying also a representative of the human race, large and fat and\nfluent, of the name of John Bone Andrews, who wrote a noble account of\nthis action, although before it began his feelings led him to seek\nsecurity in a hole far below the water-line.\n\nBut one of the strangest things ever seen, and thoroughly worth\nconsidering, was the behaviour of our two savages under heavy fire. Two,\nI say, although we had three, because Cannibal Jack behaved most\nsteadily, and like a thorough Christian. But the two others most\nstrongly proved their want of civilisation and gross ignorance of war,\ninasmuch as no sooner did they see the opening of bloodshed round them,\nthan mad they became--as mad, I assure you, as any March hares, the\nbrace of them. In the thick of our combat with the Towerful, up and down\nthe deck these fellows danced in the most conspicuous places, as if\ninviting every shot, and cracking their knuckles and jabbering. I was\nfor lashing them to the mainmast, but Captain Bampfylde would not allow\nit; he said that their spirited conduct might encourage and cheer the\nrest of us. And indeed it was strange to see how the shot flew around\nwithout striking them.\n\nNow these poor fellows showed so much attachment and strong confidence\ntowards me, that when we cast anchor in Plymouth Sound (being detached\nfor refitment there, together with eight other ships of the line), I\ntook it entirely upon myself to see them safe home, and to answer for\nthem. Our ship had been knocked about so much, that she needed a\nthorough good overhauling, and many of us had a month's leave of\nabsence, while carpenters, caulkers, and riggers were working. And these\nthree savages outwent all of us in longing to see their homes again. So\nit struck me that I might both satisfy them and also gratify myself a\nlittle, by taking them under my escort as far as their native mud-holes,\nand then for a week perhaps enjoying good young Polly's society. Captain\nBampfylde not only agreed to this, but said that he should not care\ntwopence if he never saw two of their number again. He meant, of course,\nDick and Joe, whose habits of larceny never could be thrashed out;\nwhereas Cannibal Jack was now become as honest a hand as myself almost,\nand a valuable fore-topman. Having pledged my word to bring this one\nback safe, and the others as well (if they chose to come), I set forth\nafoot for a cruise across Devon, than which, in the summer, with plenty\nof money, what can be more delightful? I would gladly have taken young\nHarry Savage, now a fine lad of fifteen years, so far as one might guess\nit; but Jack declared that he must not come, for some reason not to be\ntold to me.\n\nNow it was the flush of summer, very nearly twelve years from the time I\nfirst began with. Sunny hedges spread their overlap of roses over us,\nwhile the glad leaves danced in time with light and shade to foster\nthem. Every bank of every lane was held at home with flowers, nourished\nby some flitting rill that made a tinkle for them. And through every\ngate almost, whenever there was a man to look, the spread of feathered\ngrasses ran, like water with the wind on it.\n\nEven a sailor may see such things, and his heart rejoice and be glad in\nthem, and his perilous life for a while have rest without any thought of\nanything. Be that so, neither Dick nor Joe ever made glance at anything\nexcept the hen-roosts near the road, or the haunt of a young rabbit in\nthe hedge, or the nesting of a partridge. I kept the poor fellows from\ndoing harm, by precept and example too; yet we had a roast fowl every\nnight, except when it was a boiled one. And finding myself in my\nsixty-fourth year, what could I do but put up with it?\n\nIt must be threescore miles, I think, even according to the shortest\ncut, from Plymouth to Nympton-on-the-Moors, and we wandered out of the\nway, of course, especially after guinea-fowls, which are most deluding\ncreatures, but roast even better than their eggs boil. Also, we got into\ncherry orchards of a very noble breed; so that we spent a whole day and\ntwo nights, without any power to say farewell. And though the farmer's\nwife put up both hands to us at the window, she sent out the maid to say\nthat we need not be frightened, if we were real sailors. After giving\nthis girl a kiss (to let her know what our profession was), I sent in\nword that here was the Master of his Majesty's ship Defence, which had\ndefended the British Empire, in the late great victory. That night they\nmade all of us drunk, except me.\n\nUpon these sweet little incidents I must venture to dwell no longer,\nwhile having so much of my yarn in the slack, and none but myself to\ntauten it. Enough that we came in about ten days to the genuine naked\ncolony, without any meaning of surprise, but now as great ambassadors.\nAnd the least that we all expected was a true outburst of wild\nwelcoming. Cannibal Jack had announced his intention to convert his\nrelatives, while Dick and Joe only shook their heads, and seemed to\ndoubt the advantage of it. But we need not have thought of the matter\ntwice, for, strange to say, not one of the savages would for a moment\nacknowledge us. All the barbarous tribe stood aloof and scowled at their\nold members with utter abhorrence and contempt, as if at some vast\ndegeneracy. Even Jack's wife, or the woman who might in humanity have\nbeen called so, stood moping and mowing at him afar, as if his clothes\nmade a sheep of him, while he with amazement regarded her as if she were\nonly a chimpanzee. Whereupon all of them set up a yell, and rushed with\nsuch pelting of mud at us, that we thought ourselves lucky to make our\nescape without any further mischief.\n\nAfter hauling out of action in this most inglorious manner, we brought\nup to refit and revictual at the nearest public-house, a lonely hut\nwhere four roads met, and the sign hung from an ancient gibbet. Here we\nwere treated very kindly, and for very little money, so that I was quite\nastonished after all our feeding. And I happened to say to the landlady\nthat I was surprised to find honesty within a league of Parson Chowne.\n\n\"Oh, sir, do you know that dreadful man?\" she answered, with her apron\nup; \"or would you like to see him, sir?\"\n\n\"Madam,\" said I, with that bow of mine which takes the women captive, \"I\nshould like to see him wonderfully; only without his seeing me.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course. All people say that, because of the evil eye he\nhath. This house doth belong to him. He be coming for the rent again at\ntwo o'clock, and he never faileth. Every farthing will be ready now,\nthrough your honour's generosity; and if so be you steps in here, when\nyou hear me give three knuckles at the door, you may see him and welcome\nfor nothing; only you must not speak for ever so.\"\n\nThe landlady showed me a little cellar, opening from our sitting-room,\nand having a narrow half-boarded hatchway bearing upon her sanded\nparlour, where she designed to receive the Parson. And then she was half\nafraid lest I might make a noise and so betray her. But almost before I\nhad time to assure her of my perfect secrecy, the dash of horse's hoofs\nwas heard, and the sound of a man's voice shouting.\n\n\"Well done!\" said I to myself; \"good Parson, years have not decreased\nthee.\"\n\nHis strong step rang on the lime-ash floor, and his silver spurs made a\njingle, and lo, there he stood in the sanded parlour, as noble a Chowne\nas ever. There was not the sign of a spot of weakness or relenting about\nhim; on his shaven face no bloom of greyness, nor in his coal-black hair\none streak. As vigorous, springy, and strenuous seemed he, as when he\nleaped on board and thrashed me, nearly twelve years agone, as I do\nbelieve.\n\n\"Woman, where is my money?\" he cried, with the old pale frown overcoming\nhim; \"twice I have given you time. You know what I always do\nthereafter.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I know what your Reverence doth. Your Reverence never calleth\nlaw, but taketh horsewhip to the mans of us.\"\n\n\"Your memory is correct,\" he answered; \"my usual course is to that\neffect. I have brought my heaviest whip this time, for your husband has\nshown arrogance. Can you show cause why he should not have it?\"\n\n\"Yes, your Reverence, here it is. And God knows how we have scraped for\nit.\"\n\nWith the glow of triumph which a man's face hardly ever shows, but a\nwoman's cannot be denied of, she spread before him all his rent upon an\nancient tray, and every piece of it was copper. Thirty-six shillings she\nhad to pay, and twenty-four times thirty-six was there for his Reverence\nto count. The hostess looked at him, with a chuckle brewing now under\nher apron strings, and ready to rise to her ample breast, and thence to\nher mouth, if expedient. But she mistook her customer.\n\n\"Woman,\" said Chowne, in his deep low voice, which had no anger in it;\n\"I am tired of signing warrants.\"\n\n\"Warrants, your Worship! For what, if you please?\"\n\n\"Warrants for thieves who are foisting sham Irish halfpennies on the\npublic. I see no less than seven of them in this sterling stuff of\nyours. Three months at the treadmill now for yourself and your husband.\nSay no more. You have tried a trick. Tiverton jail for you both\nto-morrow.\"\n\nAnd there, if you wanted either of them, you must go to find them, only\ntwo days afterward, according to what I was told of it. No Welsh\ngentleman would have dreamed of behaving to his tenants thus, for trying\na little joke with him; but Chowne had no sense of any joke, unless\nhimself began it.\n\nOur three cannibals had been trembling at the sound of the Parson's\nvoice, believing that he would drive them back, and feeling that they\nhad no power to withstand his orders. But luckily we had made such a\nsmoke--all our savages having taken to the use of tobacco\ngloriously--that when the Parson put his head in, as he must do\neverywhere, he drew it back in double-quick time, for he hated the weed\nas Old Nick does. And then after calling his groom as a witness to the\nIrish coinage, he made him tie the whole of the rent-money in his\npocket-handkerchief, and off he set at a good round gallop to make out\nthe warrant. You may depend upon it that we four were very soon off as\nwell, and in the opposite direction, after subscribing a guinea among us\nto comfort the poor woman, who was sobbing her heart out at her mistake,\nand at the prospect (as seemed to me) of being confined, in more senses\nthan one, within the walls of a prison. For some time I found myself\nmuch at a loss about harbouring my convoy; for though I could trust Jack\nWildman--as I now began to call him--anywhere and with anything, this\nwas not the case with the other two, who could never be kept from\npicking up small things that took their fancy. We were shaping a course\nfor Narnton Court, where I intended to sling my own hammock, and Jack's\nas well, if agreeable; but I durst not offer to introduce Dick and Joe,\nfor the cause aforesaid. Moreover, they had not yet acquired the manners\nof good society, which were no little insisted upon in Sir Philip\nBampfylde's kitchen. Therefore I thought myself very clever, when a\nsettlement of this question suddenly occurred to me.\n\nThis was no less than to settle them both under my old ferry-boat, if\nstill to be found as two years back, shored up and turned into a\nresidence. Their rations might be sent down to them, and what happier\nhome could they wish for, with the finest air in the world around them,\nas well as beautiful scenery? And if it should happen to leak a little\n(as seems only natural), what a blessed reflection for a man of due\nsentiments towards the Lord, that this water is dropping from heaven\nupon him, instead of rushing up to swallow him into that outrageous sea!\n\nAccordingly so we contrived this affair. Mr Jack Wildman was introduced,\nunder my skilful naval tactics, into the most accomplished circle on the\nquarter-deck of our head-cook. And he looked so very gently wild, and\nblushed in his clothes so beautifully, that there was not a maiden all\nover the place but longed to glance, unbeknown, at him. So that it\nseemed a most lucky thing that Polly was down with the small-pox, at a\nplace called Muddiford; wherein she had an uncle. Meanwhile Cannibals\nDick and Joe lived in the boat, as happily as if they had been born in\nit, and devoted their time to the slaying and cooking of Sir Philip's\nhares and rabbits. It was in vain that the gamekeepers did their best to\ncatch them. Dick and Joe could catch hares, as they boasted to me,\nalmost under the watchers' noses; so noble was the result of uniting\ncivilised cunning with savage ingenuity.\n\nI can well believe that no other man, either of my rank or age, would\nhave ventured on the step which now I did resolve upon. This was no less\nthan to pay a visit to my poor little Polly, and risk all probabilities\nof being disfigured by small-pox. For several times it had crossed my\nmind, that although she was among relatives, they were not like a father\nor mother to her, and perhaps she might be but poorly tended, and even\nin need of money perhaps. For her very own aunt, our Mrs Cockhanterbury,\nwould not go nigh her, and almost shuddered when her name was mentioned.\nNow it seemed to be only fair and honest to let Sir Philip know my\nintention, so that he might (if he should see fit) forbid me to return\nto his mansion, bringing the risk of infection. But the General only\nshook his head, and smiled at that idea. \"If it be the will of God, we\nshall have it, of course,\" he said; \"and people run into it all the more\nby being over-timorous. And I have often thought it sinful to mistrust\nthe Lord so. However, you had better keep smoking a pipe, and not stay\nmore than five minutes; and perhaps you might just as well change your\nclothes before you come back, and sink the others to air for a week in\nthe river.\" I was grieved to see him so entirely place his faith in\nProvidence, for that kind of feeling (when thus overdone) ends in what\nwe call \"fatalism,\" such as the very Turks have. So that I was pleased\nwhen he called me back, and said, \"Take a swim yourself, Llewellyn. I\nhear that you can swim five miles. Don't attempt that, but swim two, if\nyou like. Swim back to us from Barnstaple bridge, and I will have a boat\nto meet you, with a wholesome wardrobe.\"\n\nThus was the whole of it arranged, and carried out most cleverly. I took\npoor Polly a bunch of grapes, from one of the Narnton vineries, as well\nas a number of nice little things, such as only a sailor can think of.\nAnd truly I went not a day too soon, for I found her in that weak\ncondition, after the fury of the plague is past, when every bit of\nstrengthening stuff that can be thought of, or fancied by, the feeble\none may turn the scale, and one cheering glance or one smiling word is\nas good as a beam of the morning. Then after a long walk, I made my\nswim, and a change of clothes, exactly as the General had commanded me.\n\nIn a fortnight afterwards where was I? Why, under the boat, in a burning\nmadness, without a soul to come nigh me, except Jack Wildman and Sir\nPhilip. These two, with the most noble courage, visited me through my\nsad attack of small-pox, as I was told thereafter, although at the time\nI knew no one. And at a distance around the boat, a ring of brushwood\nwas kept burning, day and night, to clear the air, and warn the unwary\nfrom entering. Everybody gave me up for a living Christian any more, and\nmy coffin was ordered at a handsome figure (as a death upon Narnton\npremises), ay, and made also, like that of the greatest man that I ever\ndid meet with. Not only this, but two Nonconformist preachers found out\n(as they always do) that in a weak period of my life, when dissatisfied\nwith my pension, I had been washed away by my poor wife into the\nscuppers of Dissent. Therefore they prepared two sermons on this\njudgment of the Lord, and called me a scapegoat; while goodness knows\nwhat care they took never to lay hands on me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII.\n\nMANY WEAK MOMENTS.\n\n\nNothing less than steadfast faith, and an ancient British constitution,\ncan have enabled me to survive this highly-dappled period. It was not in\nmy body only, or legs, or parts I think nothing of, but in my brain that\nI felt it most, when I had the sense to feel it. And having a brain\nwhich has no right to claim exemption from proper work, because of being\nunder average, I happened to take a long time to recover from so many\nspots striking inwards. An empty-headed man might have laughed at the\nlittle drills into his brain-pan; but with me (as with a good bee-hive\nearly in October) there could not be the prick of a brad-awl but went\ninto honey. And so my brain was in a buzz for at least a twelvemonth\nafterwards.\n\nTherefore I now must tell what happened, rather as it is told to me,\nthan as myself remember it. Only you must not expect such truth, as I\nalways give, while competent.\n\nAfter the master of the ship Defence had proved so unable to defend\nhimself, General Sir Philip Bampfylde, with his large and quiet mind\nforbidding all intrusion, opened out a little of his goodness to Jack\nWildman. There are men of the highest station, and of noble intellect,\nwho do this, and cannot help it, when they meet a fellow-man with\nsomething in him like them. There is no vanity in it, nor even desire to\nconciliate; only a little touch of something understood between them.\nAnd now being brought so together perhaps by their common kindliness,\nand with the door of death wide open, as it were, before them, the\nwell-born and highly-nurtured baronet, and the lowly, neglected, and\nignorant savage, found (perhaps all the more clearly from contrast)\nsomething harmonious in each other. At any rate they had a good deal of\ntalk by the side of the lonely river, where even the lighters kept\naloof, and hugged to the utmost the opposite shore. And the General,\nfinding much amusement in poor Jack's queer simplicity, and strange\nremarks upon men and things, would often relax without losing any of his\naccustomed dignity. So while they were speaking of death one day, Jack\nlooked at Sir Philip with an air of deep compassion and feeling, and\ntold him with tearful eyes how heartily he was grieved at one thing.\nBeing pressed as to what it was, he answered that it was Sir Philip's\nwealth.\n\n\"Because,\" said he, \"I am sad when I think that you must go to hell,\nsir.\"\n\n\"I go to hell!\" Sir Philip exclaimed, with a good deal of rather\nunpleasant surprise; \"why should I do that, Jack? I never thought that\nyou entertained so bad an opinion of me.\"\n\n\"Your Honour,\" said Jack, having picked up some of my correct\nexpressions, \"it is not me; it is God Almighty. I was told afore ever I\nlearned to read, or ever heard of reading, how it was. And so it is in\nthe Bible now. Poor men go to heaven, rich men go to hell. It must be so\nto be fair for both.\"\n\nThe General had too much sense to attempt to prove the opposite, and\nwould have thought no more about it, if Jack had dropped the subject.\nBut to do this at the proper moment requires great civilisation; while\non the other hand Jack sought comfort, needless to men of refinement.\n\n\"Your Honour must go there,\" he said, with a nod of his head which was\nmeant to settle it; \"but there is one of your race, or family\"--or\nwhatever word of that sort he employed, for he scarce could have come to\nany knowledge of things hereditary--\"who will go to heaven.\"\n\n\"Many are gone there already--too many,\" answered Sir Philip, devoutly;\n\"but tell me whom you mean, Jack. Do you mean my son the Captain?\"\n\n\"Him! no, no. I know better than that. It is plain where he must go to.\"\n\n\"Your Captain! you disloyal fellow. Why, you ought to be lashed to the\ntriangles. But who is it you are thinking of?\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" said Jack, nodding his head; and no more could Sir\nPhilip get out of him. And whenever he tried to begin again, Jack\nWildman was more than a match for him, by feigning not to understand, or\nby some other of the many tricks which nature supplies, for\nself-defence, to the savage against the civilised. If I had been well, I\nmust have shelled this poor Jack's meaning out of him; whereas, on the\nother hand, but for my illness he might never have spoken. So it came to\npass that he was sent, entirely at Sir Philip's cost, and with a\nhandsome gratuity, to rejoin our Captain in Plymouth Sound, and to carry\nback Cannibals Dick and Joe, who had scoured away at great speed upon\nhearing of my sudden misfortune.\n\nNow I will tell you a very strange thing, and quite out of my\nexperience: even after small-pox, which enlarged and filled me with\ncharity, as well as what I had scarcely room for--increase of humility.\nThis is, that though Captain Bampfylde had some little spare time at\nPlymouth, he had such command of himself that he never went near his\nbeloved Isabel. Nothing could have so checked a man of heartiness and\nbravery, except the strongest power of honour, and a long time of\nchastisement. There was a lovely young woman, and here a fine though\nmiddle-aged man, her husband; they loved one another with heart and\nsoul, and they never met, but through a telescope! It may have been\nright, or it may have been wrong--I should have thought it wrong,\nperhaps, if the case had been my own--but they pledged their honour and\nkept it. Drake Bampfylde (like his father) had a strength of trust in\nProvidence. But this trust has no landed security, now that the Lord\nhas found the world so clever, that He need not interfere with it.\n\nThe 74-gun ship Defence was known to be the fastest sailer in the\nBritish Navy; not from her build alone, or balance, but from my careful\ntrim of her sails, and knowledge of how to handle her. Hours and hours I\nspent aloft, among lifts, and braces, and clue-garnets, marking the draw\nof every sail, and righting all useless bellying. So that I could now\nhave warranted her the first of our Navy to break the line, if rigged\naccording to my directions, and with me for her master. However (while I\nlay docked like this, careened I might say, and unlikely ever to carry a\nkeel again), the Defence, without my knowledge even, being new-masted,\nsailed to join the Channel Fleet, with Heaviside acting as her master;\nand as might have been expected, fell to leeward one knot in three. And\neven worse than this befell her; for in the second of those two\nmiserable actions, under Hotham in the year 1795, when even Nelson could\ndo nothing, the Defence having now another captain as well as a stupid\nmaster, actually backed her mizzen-topsail, in the rear of the enemy,\nwhen the signal was to fill and stand on. However, as even that famous\nship the Agamemnon did nothing that day, through getting no opportunity,\nwe must forgive poor Heaviside, especially as he was not captain. But\nthe one who ground his teeth the hardest, and could forgive nobody, was\nthe Honourable Rodney Bluett, now first lieutenant of the Defence. By\nthis time every one must desire to know why Captain Bampfylde was not\nthere, as he might have been, and might have made himself famous, but\nfor his usual ill-fortune. This had carried him to the East Indies,\nbefore the Defence had finished refitting; and there, with none of his\nold hands near him, he commanded a line-of-battle ship, under Commodore\nRainier; and after some hard work, and very fine fighting, drove the\nbrave Dutchmen out of the castle of Trincomalee, in August 1795, which\nwe came to hear of afterwards.\n\nThus it was that everybody seemed to be scattered everywhere. None of us\nhappened to hold together, except those three poor savages; and they, by\na sort of instinct, managed to get over accidents. For they stuck, with\nthat fidelity which is lost by education, to Rodney Bluett, as soon as\never poor Father Davy failed them. But this is a melancholy subject, and\nmust soon be done with.\n\nLet me, then, not dwell upon this visitation of the Lord for a moment\nlonger than the claims of nation and of kin combine to make it needful.\nNor did it seem to matter much for a long time what became of me. The\nvery first thing I remember, after months of wandering, has something to\ndo with the hush of waves, and the soft breath of heaven spread over me.\nAlso kind young voices seemed to be murmuring around me, with a dear\nregard and love, and sense of pretty watchfulness; and the sound of my\nnative tongue as soft as the wool of a nest to my bosom.\n\nBecause I was lying in a hammock, slung, by Colonel Lougher's orders,\nbetwixt the very same mooring-posts (at about half-tide in Newton Bay)\nwhich truly enabled the sons of Devon to make such a safe job of\nstealing his rocks. Not only the Colonel, but Lady Bluett, who generally\nled his judgment, felt by this time the pleasure of owing true gratitude\nto somebody. My fatherly care of the young lieutenant had turned him out\nso nobly.\n\nIt misbecomes me to speak of this; and it misbecame me to speak at all,\nwith the sea-breeze flowing over me, the first words of knowledge that I\nhad spoken for how long I know not. Nothing can be too high, or too low,\nfor human nature at both ends; but I ought to have known better than to\ndo the thing I did.\n\n\"Give me a pipe,\" was all I said; and then I turned away, and cared not\nwhether I got my pipe, or whether the rising tide extinguished me.\n\n\"Here is your pipe, sir,\" came in a beautiful voice from down below me;\n\"and we have the tinder ready. Bunny, let me do it now.\"\n\nThat pipe must have saved my life. Everybody said so. It came and went\nin curls of comfort through the hollow dying places of my head, that had\nnot even blood enough to call for it; and then it never left my soul\nuneasy about anything. Hammock and all must have gone afloat, with the\nrapid rise of the spring, except for Colonel Lougher's foresight.\n\nWho was it that watched me so, and would have waited by my side, until\nthe waves were over her? Who was it that kept on listening, to let me\nknow, while I could not speak? Who was it that gave a little bit of a\nsigh, every now and then, and then breathed hard to smother it? Who was\nit, or who could it be, in the whole wide world, but Bardie?\n\nNot only this, but when I began to be up to real sense again, the\nkindness of every one around me made me fit for nothing. In the\nweakness of expecting all to take advantage of me (as is done in health\nand spirits), all the weakness I could find was in my friends and\nneighbours always labouring to encourage me. This to my mind proves\nalmost the wrongness of expecting people to be worse than we are.\n\nThat winter was the most severe, all over Western Europe, known for\nfive-and-fifty years. I well remember the dreadful winter A.D. 1740,\nwhen the Severn was frozen with a yard of ice, and the whole of the\nBristol Channel blocked with icebergs like great hay-ricks. Twelve\npeople were frozen to death in our parish, and seven were killed through\nthe ice on the sea. The winter of 1795 was nothing to be compared to\nthat; nevertheless it was very furious, and killed more than we could\nspare of our very oldest inhabitants.\n\nAnd but for the extraordinary kindness of Colonel Lougher, that winter\nmust have killed not only me in my weak and worn-out condition, but also\nthe poor maid of Sker, if left to encounter the cold in that iceberg.\nFor, truly speaking, the poor old house was nothing else through that\nwinter. The snow in swirling sheets of storm first wrapped it up to the\nwindow-sills; and then in a single night overleaped gables, roofs, and\nchimney-tops. Moxy and Watkin passed a month of bitter cold and\ndarkness, but were lucky enough to have some sheep, who kept them warm\noutside, and warmed their insides afterwards. And after that the thaw\ncame. But all this time there was nobody in my little cottage at Newton,\nbut poor Roger Berkrolles, and how he kept soul and body together is\nknown to none save himself and Heaven. For Colonel Lougher and Lady\nBluett, at the very beginning of the frost, sent down my old friend,\nCrumpy the butler, to report upon my condition, and to give his candid\nopinion what was the best thing to do with me. After that long struggle\nnow (thanks to a fine constitution and the death of the only doctor\nanywhere on our side of Bridgend), I had begun to look up a little and\nto know the time of day. Crumpy felt my pulse, and nodded, and then\nprescribed the only medicine which his own experience in life had ever\nverified. Port wine, he said, was the only thing to put me on my legs\nagain. And this he laid before the Colonel with such absence of all\ndoubt, that on the very same afternoon a low and slow carriage was sent\nfor me, and I found myself laid in a very snug room, with the firelight\ndancing in the reflection of the key of the wine-cellar. Also here was\nBardie flitting, light as a gnat in spring-time, and Bunny to be had\nwhenever anybody wanted her. Only her scantling and her tonnage unfitted\nher for frigate-service.\n\nWhat had a poor old fellow like me--as in weak moments I called\nmyself--ever done, or even suffered, to deserve to find the world an Inn\nof good Samaritans? I felt that it was all of pure unreasonable\nkindness; the very thing which a man of spirit cannot bear to put up\nwith. I have felt this often, when our Parson discoursed about our\ngracious Lord, and all the things He did for us. A man of proper\nself-respect would like to have had a voice in it.\n\nThis, however (as Hezekiah told us in the cockpit, after we had pickled\nhim), might be safely attributed to the force of unregeneracy; while a\nman who is down in luck, and constitution also, trusts to any stout\nmortal for a loan of orthodoxy. And so did I to our Rector Lougher,\nbrother of the Colonel, a gentleman who had bought my fish, and felt my\nspiritual needs. To him I listened (for well he read), especially a\npsalm to which I could for ever listen, full of noble navigation, deeper\neven than our soundings in the Bay of Biscay.\n\nEvery night we used to wonder where Lieutenant Bluett was, knowing as we\ndid from my descriptions (when the hob was hot) what it is to be at sea\nwith all the rigging freezing. When the blocks are clogged with ice and\nmake mysterious groanings, and the shrouds have grown a beard as cold as\ntheir own name is, and the deck begins to slip; and all the watch with\nropes to handle, spit upon their palms, and strike them (dancing with\ntheir toes the while) one man to another man's, hoping to see sparks\ncome out. So it is, I can assure you, who have never been at sea, when\nthe barbs of icy spray by a freezing wind are driven, like a volley of\nlangrel-shot raking the ship from stem to stern, shrivelling blue cheeks\nand red noses, shattering quids from the chattering teeth. Many a time\nin these bitter nights, with the roar of east wind through the\nfir-trees, and the rattle of doors in the snow-drift, I felt ashamed of\nmy cozy berth, and could not hug my comfort, from thinking of my ancient\nmessmates turned to huddled icicles.\n\nBut all was ordained for the best, no doubt: for supposing that I had\nbeen at sea through the year 1795, or even 1796, what single general\naction was there worthy of my presence? It might have been otherwise\nwith me there, and in a leading position. However, even of this I cannot\nby any means be certain, for seamen quite as brave and skilful were\nafloat at that very time. However, beyond a few frigate actions, and\nmatters far away from home, at the Cape, or in the East Indies, I did\nnot hear of anything that I need have longed much to partake in. So that\nI did not repent of accepting a harbour-appointment at Plymouth, which\n(upon my partial recovery) was obtained for me by Sir Philip Bampfylde,\nan old friend of the Port-Admiral there.\n\nFor that good Sir Philip was a little uneasy, after shipping me off last\nautumn, lest he might have behaved with any want of gratitude towards\nme. Of course he had done nothing of the kind; for in truth I had raved\nfor my country so--as I came to learn long afterwards--that when all the\nrisk of infection was over, the doctor from Barnstaple said that my only\nchance of recovering reason lay in the air of my native land. But at any\nrate this kind baronet thought himself bound to come and look after me,\nin the spring of the year when the buds were awake, and the iron was\ngone from the soul of the earth. He had often promised that fine old\ntyrant Anthony Stew to revisit him; so now he resolved to kill two birds\nwith one stone, as the saying is.\n\nI had returned to my cottage now, but being still very frail and stupid,\nin spite of port wine every day, I could not keep the tears from\nstarting, when this good and great landowner bent his silver head\nbeneath my humble lintel, and forbade me in his calm majestic manner to\nthink for a moment of dousing my pipe. And even Justice Stew, who of\ncourse took good care to come after him, did not use an uncivil word,\nwhen he saw what Sir Philip thought of me.\n\n\"Sir,\" said the General to the Squire, after shaking hands most\nkindly with me, \"this is a man whom I truly respect. There seems to\nbe but one opinion about him. I call him a noble specimen of your\nfellow-countrymen.\"\n\n\"Yes, to be sure,\" answered Anthony Stew: \"but my noble\nfellow-countrymen say that I am an Irishman.\"\n\n\"No doubt whatever about that, your Worship,\" was the proper thing for\nme to reply; but the condition of my head forbade me almost to shake it.\nIf it had pleased the Lord to give me only a dozen holes and\nscars--which could not matter at my time of life--there would not by any\nmeans have arisen, as all the old women of Newton said, this sad\npressure on the brain-pan, and difficulty of coping even with a man of\nAnthony Stew's kind. But, alas! instead of opening out, the subtle\nplague struck inwards, leaving not a sign outside, but a delicate\ntransparency.\n\nThis visit from Sir Philip did not end without a queer affair, whereof I\nhad no notice then, being set down by all the village as only fit to\npoke about among the sandhills, and then to die. But no one could take\nthe church-clock from me, till the bell should be tolling for me; and as\na matter of duty I drew some long arrears of salary.\n\nIt seems that Sir Philip drove down one day from Pen Coed to look after\nme, and having done this with his usual kindness, spread word through\nthe children (who throughout our lane abounded) that really none of his\nmoney remained for any more sticks of peppermint. It was high time for\nthem to think, he said, after ever so much education, of earning from\nsevenpence to tenpence a-week, for the good of the babies they carried.\nAll the children gathered round him at this fine idea, really not\nbelieving quite that the purse of such a gentleman could have nothing\nmore to say. And the girls bearing babes were concave in the back, while\nthe boys in the same predicament stuck out clumsily where their spines\nwere setting.\n\n\"Drive me away,\" said Sir Philip to the groom; \"drive me straight away\nanywhere: these Welsh children are so clever, I shall have no chance\nwith them.\"\n\n\"Indeed, your Honour, they is,\" said the groom with a grin, as behoved a\nWelshman. \"Would your Honour like to go down by the sea, and see our\nbeautiful water-rocks, and our old annshent places?\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" said Sir Philip; \"the very thing. We have four hours' time\nto dinner yet; and I fear I have worn out poor Llewellyn. Now follow the\ncoast-line if you are sure that your master would like it, Lewis, with\nthis young horse, and our weight behind.\"\n\n\"Your Honour, nothing ever comes amiss to this young horse here. 'Tis\ntire I should like to see him, for a change, as we do say. And master do\nalways tell me keep salt-water on his legs whenever.\"\n\n\"Right!\" cried Sir Philip, who loved the spree, being as full of spirits\nstill, when the air took his trouble out of him, as the young horse in\nthe shafts was.\n\nSo they drove away over the sands towards Sker, which it is easy enough\nto do with a good strong horse and a light car behind him. And by this\ntime the neighbourhood had quite forgotten all its dread of sand-storms.\nIn about half an hour they found themselves in a pretty place of grass\nand furze known as the Lock's Common, which faces the sea over some low\ncliffs, and at the western end coves down to it. This is some half a\nmile from Sker House, and a ragged dry wall makes the parish boundary,\nsevering it from Sker-land.\n\n\"Drive on,\" cried Sir Philip; \"I enjoy all this: I call this really\nbeautiful, and this fine sward reminds me of Devonshire. But they ought\nto plant some trees here.\"\n\nThe driver replied that there was some danger in driving through Sker\nwarren, unless one knew the ground thoroughly, on account of the number\nof rabbit-holes; and the baronet, with that true regard which a\ngentleman feels for the horse of a friend, cancelled his order\nimmediately. \"But,\" he continued, \"I am so thirsty that I scarcely know\nwhat to do. My friend Llewellyn's hospitality is so overpowering. The\ntaste of rum is almost unknown to me; but I could not refuse when he\npressed me so. It has made me confoundedly thirsty, Lewis.\"\n\n\"Your honour,\" said Lewis, \"just round that corner, in a little break of\nthe rocks, there is one of the finest springs in Glamorgan, 'Ffynnon\nWen' we call it, the water does be sparkling so.\"\n\nThe groom, having no cup to fetch the water, stood by the horse in the\nlittle pant or combe; while old Sir Philip went down to the shore, to\ndrink as our first forefather drank, and Gideon's men in the Bible.\nWhether he lapped or dipped, I know not (probably the latter, at his\ntime of life), anyhow he assuaged his thirst--which rum of my quality\ncould not have caused in a really sound constitution, after taking no\nmore than a thimbleful--and then for a moment he sate on a rock, soothed\nby the purling water, to rest and to look around him. The place has no\ngreat beauty, as of a sea-side spring in Devonshire, but more of cheer\nand life about it than their ferny grottoes. The bright water breaks\nfrom an elbow of rock, in many veins all uniting, and without any cliff\nabove them; and then, after rushing a very few yards through set stone\nand loose shingle, loses its self-will upon the soft sand, and spreads a\nway over a hundred yards of vague wetness and shallow shining.\n\nThe mild sun of April was glancing on this, and the tide just advancing\nto see to it, when the shadow of a slim figure fell on the stones before\nSir Philip. So quietly had she slipped along, and appeared from the\nrocks so suddenly, that neither old man nor young maiden thought of the\nother until their eyes met.\n\n\"What, why, who?\" cried the General, with something as much like a\nstart as good conscience and long service had left in him: \"who are you?\nWho are you, my dear?\"\n\nFor his eyes were fixed on a fair young damsel of some fifteen summers,\nstanding upright, with a pad on her head, and on the pad a red pitcher.\nOver her shoulders, and down to her waist, fell dark-brown curls\nabundantly, full of gleaming gold where the sun stole through the rocks\nto dwell in them. Her dress was nothing but blue Welsh flannel, gathered\nat the waist and tucked in front, and her beautifully tinted legs and\nazure-veined feet shone under it.\n\n\"Who are you, my pretty creature?\" Sir Philip Bampfylde asked again,\nwhile she opened her grey eyes wide at him.\n\n\"Y Ferch o'r Scer, Syr,\" she answered shyly, and with the strong\nguttural tone which she knew was unpleasant to English ears. For it was\nher sensitive point that she could not tell any one who she was; and her\npride (which was manifold) always led her to draw back from questions.\n\nOn the other hand the old man's gaze of strong surprise and deep\ninterest faded into mere admiration at the sound of our fine language.\n\n\"Fair young Cambrian, I have asked you rudely, and you are displeased\nwith me. Lift your curls, my little dear, and let me see your face a\nwhile. I remember one just like it. There, you are put out again! So it\nwas with the one I mean when anything happened hastily.\"\n\nThe beautiful girl flung back her hair, and knelt to stoop her pitcher\nin the gurgling runnel; and then she looked at his silver locks, and was\nsorry for her impatience.\n\n\"Sir, I beg you to forgive me, if I have been rude to you. I am the maid\nfrom the old house yonder. I am often sent for this water, because it\nsparkles much more than our own does. If you please, I must go home,\nsir.\"\n\nShe filled the red pitcher, and tucked the blue skirt, as girls alone\ncan manage it; and Sir Philip Bampfylde sighed at thinking of his age\nand loneliness, while with an old-fashioned gentleman's grace he lifted\nthe pitcher and asked no more upon whose head he laid it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII.\n\nMORE HASTE, LESS SPEED.\n\n\nTo do what is thoroughly becoming and graceful is my main desire. That\nany man should praise himself, and insist upon his own exploits and\nservices to his native land, or even should let people guess at his\nvalour, by any manner of side-wind,--such a course would simply deprive\nme of the only thing a poor battered sailor has left to support him\nagainst his pension; I mean of course humble, but nevertheless\nwell-grounded, self-respect.\n\nThis delicacy alone forbids me even to allude to that urgent and\nuniversal call for my very humble services which launched me on the\nbriny waves once more, and in time for a share in the glorious battle\nfought off Cape St Vincent. Upon that great St Valentine's Day of 1797 I\nwas Master of the Excellent, under Captain Collingwood; and every boy in\nthe parish knows how we captured the Saint Isidore, and really took the\nSaint Nicholas, though other people got the credit, and nearly took a\nfour-decked ship of 130 guns, whose name was the Saint Miss Trinder, and\nwho managed to sneak away, when by all rights we had got her.\n\nHowever, let us be content with things beyond contradiction; the\nforemost of which is, that no ship ever was carried into action in a\nmore masterly style than the Excellent upon that occasion. And the\nweight of this falls on the Master, far more than the Captain, I do\nassure you. So highly were my skill and coolness commended in the\ndespatches, that if I could have borne to be reduced below inferior men,\nI might have died a real Captain in the British Navy. For (as happened\nto the now Captain Bowen, when Master of the Queen Charlotte) I was\noffered a lieutenant's commission, and doubted about accepting it. Had I\nbeen twenty years younger, of course, I must have jumped at the offer;\nbut at my time of life, and with all my knowledge, it would have been\ntoo painful to be ordered about by some young dancer; therefore I\ndeclined; at the same time thinking it fair to suggest, for the sake of\nthe many true Britons now dependent upon me, that a small pecuniary\nremittance would meet with my consideration. That faculty of mine,\nhowever, was not called to the encounter: I never heard more about it,\nand had to be satisfied with glory.\n\nBut if a man is undervalued often, and puts up with it, he generally\nfinds that fortune treats him with respect in other more serious\naspects. For instance, what would have happened if Providence had\nordained to send me into either of those sad mutinies which disgraced\nour fleets so terribly? That deep respect for authority which (like the\nyolk of a nest-egg) lies calmly inside me, waiting to be sate upon; as\nwell as my inborn sense of Nature's resistless determination to end by\nturning me into a gentleman (indications of which must have long ago\nbeen perceived by every reader), not to mention any common sense of duty\nin the abstract and wages in the pocket,--these considerations must have\nled me to lay a pistol to the head of almost every man I could find.\n\nHowever, from such a course of action grace and mercy preserved me: and\nperhaps it was quite as well. For I am not sure that I could have\nstopped any one of the four mutinies entirely; although I can answer for\nit, that never would bad manners take the lead in any ship, while I was\nMaster. It is the shilly-shallying that produces all the mischief. If\nall our Captains had behaved like Captain Peard and his first\nlieutenant, in the St George off Cadiz, at the first spread of\ndisaffection, it is my opinion that a great disgrace and danger would\nhave been crushed in the bud. But what could be expected when our\nGovernment showed the like weakness? Twice they went hankering after\npeace, and even sent ambassadors! Who can ram shot home with pleasure\nwhile things of this kind are encouraged? To fight it out is the true\nChristianity, ordered by the Church itself.\n\nAnd this we did, and are doing still, as Roger Berkrolles prophesied;\nand the only regret I have about it is, that a stiffness in my knees\nenables the other boarders to take a mean advantage of their youth, and\njump into the chains or port-holes of a ship (when by my tactics\nconquered), so as to get a false lead of me. However, no small\nconsolation was to be gained by reflecting how much more prize-money\nwould accrue to me than to any of these forward fellows, so that one\nmight with an unmoved leg contemplate their precipitancy.\n\nEven a sorer grievance was the breaking up and dispersion of our noble\nand gallant ship's company, so long accustomed to one another and to\nsharp discipline in the Defence. Where was Captain Bampfylde? Where was\nLieutenant Rodney Bluett? What was become of our three fine savages?\nEven Heaviside and Hezekiah were in my thoughts continually, and out of\nmy knowledge entirely. As to the latter worthy gunsmith, \"Artillerist\nto the King and Queen, and all the Royal Family,\" I can only at present\nsay that when I had been last at home, and before my acceptance of that\nbrief appointment in the Plymouth dockyard--in short, when first I\nrecovered strength, after that long illness, to cope with the walk both\nto and fro--I found occasion to go to Bridgend, with my uniform on for\nthe sake of the town. I had not turned the corner of the bridge a good\nhalf-hour, before that important fact was known from the riverbank to\nthe churchyard. And Griffith of the \"Cat and Snuffers,\" set up such a\nWelsh hurrah [as good as the screech of a wild-cat trapped] that it went\nup the hill to Newcastle. In a word, Hepzibah heard of me, and ran down\nthe hill, like a roaring lion, demanding her Hezekiah!\n\nWhat ensued is painful to me even now to speak of. For though my\nconscience was refitting, and ready to knock about again, after carrying\ntoo much sail, I could not find it in my heart to give the mother of a\nrapid family nothing but lies to feed upon. Many men of noble nature\ndwell upon nothing but conscience; as if that were the one true compass\nfor a man to steer by--whereas I never did find a man--outside my own\nSunday clothes,--whose conscience would not back him up in whatever he\nhad a mind for.\n\nMy own had always worked like a power plainly exposed to every one;\nthereby gaining strength and revolving as fast as a mountain windmill,\nwhen the corn is falling away to chaff. This, however, was not required\nin the present instance; for Hepzibah (like a good woman) fell from one\nextreme into the opposite. From bitter reviling to praise and gratitude\nwas but a turn of the tongue to her; especially when I happened to\nwhisper into the ear of Griffith that the whole of my stipend for Newton\nChurch clock would now, according to my views of justice, be handed to\nHezekiah's wife, inasmuch as the worthy gunsmith had rejoined the Church\nof England. And I said what a dreadful blow this would be to all the\nNicodemites, when the gun-officer returned with money enough to build a\nchapel: however, I felt that it served them right, because they had\nlately begun to sneer at his good wife's wonderful prophecies.\n\nIn a word, I had promised to find Hezekiah; and, both while in harbour\nand now when afloat, I tried to get tidings not only of him, but also of\nthe Newton tailor, and Heaviside, and the three wild men, as well as\nyoung Harry Savage, Lieutenant Bluett, and Captain Bampfylde. For all of\nthese being at sea and in war-time, who could say what had befallen\nthem? Whereas I knew all about most of our people now living ashore in\nthe middle of peace. However, of course one must expect old shipmates to\nbe parted; and with all the vast force now afloat under the British\nflag, it would almost be a wonder if any of us should haul our wind\nwithin hailing distance of the others during our cruise in this world.\n\nNevertheless it did so happen, as I plainly will set forth, so far as I\nremember. Through the rest of the year '97 and the early part of the\nfollowing year I was knocking about off and on near the Straits, being\nappointed to another ship while the Excellent was refitting, and\nafterwards to the Goliath, a fine 74, under Captain Foley.\n\nIn the month of May 1798, all our Mediterranean fleet, except three\nships of the line, lay blockading Cadiz. Our Admiral, the Earl St\nVincent, formerly Sir John Jervis, had orders also to watch Toulon,\nwhere a great fleet was assembling. And our information was so scant and\ncontradictory, that our Admiral sent but three ships of the line and a\nfrigate or two to see what those crafty Frenchmen might be up to. But\nthis searching squadron had a commander whose name was Horatio Nelson.\n\nThis was not by any means the man to let frog-eaters do exactly as they\npleased with us. \"I believe in the King of England; I have faith in\ndiscipline; I abhor all Frenchmen worse than the very devil.\" Such was\nhis creed; and at any moment he would give his life for it. It is\nsomething for a man to know what he means, and be able to put it\nclearly; and this alone fetches to his side more than half of the\narguers who cannot make their minds up. But it is a much rarer gift, and\nnot often combined with the other, for a man to enter into, and be able\nto follow up, ways and turns, and ins and outs, of the natures of all\nother men. If this is done by practised subtlety, it arouses hatred, and\ncan get no further. But if it be a gift of nature exercised unwittingly,\nand with kind love of manliness, all who are worth bringing over are\nbrought over by it.\n\nIf it were not hence, I know not whence it was that Nelson had such\npower over every man of us. To know what he meant, to pronounce it, and\nto perceive what others meant, these three powers enabled him to make\nall the rest mean what he did. At any rate such is my opinion; although\nI would not fly in the face of better scholars than myself, who\ndeclared that here was witchcraft. What else could account for the\nmanner in which all Nelson's equals in rank at once acknowledged him as\nthe foremost, and felt no jealousy towards him? Even Admiral Earl St\nVincent, great commander as he was, is said to have often deferred to\nthe judgment of the younger officer. As for the men, they all looked\nupon it as worth a gold watch to sail under him.\n\nTherefore we officers of the inshore squadron, under Captain Troubridge,\ncould scarcely keep our crews from the most tremendous and uproarious\ncheers when we got orders to make sail for the Mediterranean, and place\nourselves under the command of Nelson. We could not allow any cheering,\nbecause the Dons ashore were not to know a word about our departure,\nlest they should inform the Crappos, under whose orders they now were\nacting. And a British cheer has such a ring over the waters of the sea,\nand leaps from wave to wave so, that I have heard it a league away when\nroused up well to windward. So our fine fellows had leave to cheer to\ntheir hearts' content when we got our offing; and partly under my\nconduct (for I led the way in the Goliath), nine seventy-fours got away\nto sea in the night of the 24th of May, and nine liners from England\nreplaced them, without a single Jack Spaniard ever suspecting any\nmovement. Every one knows what a time we had of it, after joining our\nAdmiral; how we dashed away helter-skelter, from one end of the world to\nthe other almost, in a thorough wild-goose chase, because the Board of\nAdmiralty, with their usual management, sent thirteen ships of the line\nespecially on a searching scurry without one frigate to scout for them!\nWe were obliged to sail, of course, within signalling distance of each\nother, and so that line of battle might be formed without delay, upon\nappearance of the enemy. For we now had a man whose signal was \"Go at\n'em when you see 'em.\" Also, as always comes to pass when the sons of\nBeelzebub are abroad, a thick haze lay both day and night upon the face\nof the water. So that, while sailing in close order, upon the night of\nthe shortest day, we are said to have crossed the wake of the Frenchmen,\nalmost ere it grew white again, without even sniffing their roasted\nfrogs. Possibly this is true, in spite of all the great Nelson's\nvigilance; for I went to my hammock quite early that night, having\nsuffered much from a hollow eye-tooth ever since I lost sight of poor\nPolly.\n\nAdmiral Nelson made no mistake. He had in the highest degree what is\ncalled in human nature \"genius,\" and in dogs and horses \"instinct.\"\nThat is to say, he knew how to sniff out the road to almost anything.\nTrusting to this tenfold (when he found that our Government would not\nhear of it, but was nearly certain of a mighty landing upon Ireland),\noff he set for Egypt, carrying on with every blessed sail that would or\neven would not draw. We came to that coast at a racing speed, and you\nshould have seen his vexation when there was no French ship in the\nroadstead. \"I have made a false cast, Troubridge,\" he cried; \"I shall\nwrite to be superseded. My want of judgment may prove fatal to my King\nand country.\"\n\nFor our Government had sent him word, through the Earl St Vincent, that\nthe great expedition from Toulon would sail for England or Ireland; and\nhe at his peril had taken upon him to reject such nonsense. But now (as\nhappens by Nature's justice to all very sanguine men) he was ready to\nsmite the breast that had suggested pure truth to him. Thus being\nbaffled we made all sail, and after a chase of six hundred leagues, and\ncontinually beating to windward, were forced to bear up on St Swithin's\nDay and make for the coast of Sicily. And it shows the value of good old\nhands, and thoroughly sound experience, that I, the oldest man perhaps\nin the fleet, could alone guide the fleet into Syracuse. Here our fierce\nexcitement bubbled while we took in water.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX.\n\nIN A ROCKY BOWER.\n\n\nI never hear of a man's impatience without sagely reflecting upon the\nrapid flight of time, when age draws on, and business thickens, and all\nthe glory of this world must soon be left behind us. From the date of my\ngreat catch of fish and landing of Bardie at Pool Tavan, to the day of\nmy guiding the British fleet betwixt the shoals of Syracuse, more than\nsixteen years had passed, and scarce left time to count them.\n\nTherefore it was but a natural thing that the two little maidens with\nwhom I began should now be grown up, and creating a stir in the minds of\nyoung men of the neighbourhood. Early in this present month of July,\nthat north-west breeze, which was baffling our fleet off the coast of\nAnatolia, was playing among the rocks of Sker with the curls and skirts\nand ribbons of these two fair young damsels.\n\nOr rather with the ribbons of one, for Bunny alone wore streamers,\nwherein her heart delighted; while the maid of Sker was dressed as\nplainly as if she had been her servant. Not that her inborn love of\nbrightness ever had abandoned her, but that her vanities were put down\nquite arrogantly by Master Berkrolles whenever she came back from\nCandleston; and but for her lessons in music there--which were beyond\nRoger's compass--he would have raised his voice against her visits to\nthe good Colonel.\n\nFor the old man's heart was entirely fixed upon the graceful maiden, and\nhis chief anxiety was to keep her out of the way of harm. He knew that\nthe Colonel loved nothing better (as behoved his lineage) than true and\nfree hospitality; and he feared that the simple and nameless girl might\nset her affections on some grand guest, who would scorn her derelict\norigin.\n\nNow she led Bunny into a cave, or rather a snug little cove of rock,\nwhich she always called her cradle, and where she had spent many lonely\nhours, in singing pure Welsh melodies of the sweetest sadness, feeling a\nlove of the desert places from her own desertion. Then down she sate in\nher chair of stone, with limpets and barnacles studding it; while Bunny\nin the established manner bounced down on a pebble and gazed at her.\n\nMy son's daughter was a solid girl, very well built as our family is,\nand raking most handsomely fore and aft. Her fine black eyes, and\nabiding colour, and the modesty inherited from her grandfather, and some\nreflection perhaps of his fame, made her a favourite everywhere. And any\ngrandfather might well have been proud to see how she carried her dress\noff.\n\nThe younger maid sate right above her, quite as if Nature had ordered it\nso; and drew her skirt of home-spun camlet over her dainty feet, because\nthe place was wet and chilly. And anybody looking must have said that\nshe was born to grace. The clear outlines of oval face and delicate\nstrength of forehead were moulded as by Nature only can such dainty work\nbe done. Gentle pride and quiet moods of lonely meditation had deepened\nand subdued the radiance of the large grey eyes, and changed the dancing\nmirth of childhood into soft intelligence. And it must have been a fine\naffair, with the sunshine glancing on the breezy sea, to take a look at\nthe lights and shadows of so clear a countenance.\n\nBunny, like a frigate riding, doused her head and all her outworks\nforward of the bends; and then hung fluttering and doubtful, just as if\nshe had missed stays.\n\n\"It is not your engagement, my dear Bunny,\" began Delushy, as if she\nwere ten years the senior officer; \"you must not suppose for a moment\nthat I object to your engagement. It is time, of course, for you to\nthink, among so many suitors, of some one to put up with, especially\nafter what you told me about having toothache. And Watkin is thoroughly\ngood and kind, and able to read quite respectably. But what I blame you\nfor is this, that you have not been straightforward, Bunny. Why have you\nkept me in the dark about this one of your many 'sweetheartings,' as you\nalways call them?\"\n\n\"And for sure, miss, then I never did no such thing; unless it was that\nI thought you was wanting him.\"\n\n\"I! You surely cannot have thought it! I want Watkin Thomas!\"\n\n\"Well, miss, you need not fly out like that. All the girls in Newton was\nafter him. And if it wasn't you as wanted him, it might be him as wanted\nyou, which comes to the same thing always.\"\n\n\"I don't quite think that it does, dear Bunny, though you may have made\nit do so. Now look up and kiss me, dear: you know that I love you very\nmuch, though I have a way of saying things. And then I am longing to beg\npardon when I have vexed any one. It comes of my 'noble birth,' I\nsuppose, which the girls of Newton laugh about. How I wish that I were\nbut the child of the poorest good man in the parish! But now I am tired\nof thinking of it. What good ever comes of it? And what can one poor\natom matter?\"\n\n\"You are not a poor atom; you are the best, and the cleverest, and most\nlearnedest, and most beautifullest lady as ever was seen in the whole of\nthe land.\"\n\nAfter or rather in the middle of which words, our Bunny, with her usual\nvigour and true national ardour, leaped into the arms of Delushy, so\nthat they had a good cry together. \"You will wait, of course, for your\nGranny to come, before you settle anything.\"\n\n\"Will I, indeed?\" cried that wicked Bunny, and lucky for her that I was\nnot there: \"I shall do nothing of the sort. If he chooses to be always\naway at sea, conquering the French for ever, and never coming home when\nhe can help it, he must make up his mind to be surprised when he happens\nto come home again. For sure then, that is right enough.\"\n\n\"Well, it does seem almost reasonable,\" answered the young lady: \"and I\nthink sometimes that we have no right to expect so much as that of\nthings. It is not what they often do; and so they lose the habit of it.\"\n\n\"I do not quite understand,\" said Bunny.\n\n\"And I don't half understand,\" said Bardie:--\"but--oh my dear, what\nshall I do? He is coming this way, I am sure. And I would not have you\nknow anything of it--and of course you must feel that it is all\nnonsense. And I did not mean any harm about 'courting;' only you ought\nto be out of the way, and yet at the same time in it.\"\n\nOur Bunny was such a slow-witted girl, and at the same time so\nparticular (inheriting slowness from her good mother, and conscience\nfrom third generation), that really she could make no hand at meeting\nsuch a crisis. For now she began to perceive gold-lace, which alone\ndiscomfits the woman-race, and sets their minds going upon what they\nlove. And so she did very little else but stare.\n\n\"I did think you would have helped me, Bunny,\" Delushy cried, with\naggrievement. \"I wanted to hear your own affairs, of course; but I would\nnot have brought you here----\"\n\n\"Young ladies, well met!\" cried as solid a voice as the chops of the\nChannel had ever tautened: \"I knew that you were here, and so I came\ndown to look after you.\"\n\n\"Sure then, sir, and I do think that it is very kind of you. We was just\nawanting looking after. Oh what a fish I do see in that pool! Please\nonly you now both to keep back. I shall be back again, now just, sir.\"\nWith these words away flew Bunny, as if her life were set on it.\n\n\"What a fine creature, to be sure!\" said Commander Bluett, thoughtfully;\n\"she reminds me so much of her grandfather. There is something so\nstrongly alike between them, in their reckless outspoken honour, as well\nas in the turn of the nose they have.\"\n\n\"Let us follow, and admire her a little more,\" cried Delushy: \"she\ndeserves it, as you say; and perhaps--well perhaps she likes it.\"\n\nYoung Rodney looked at her a little while, and then at the ground a\nlittle while; because he was a stupid fellow as concerns young women. He\nthought this one such a perfect wonder, as may well be said of all of\nthem. Then those two fenced about a little, out of shot of each other's\neyes.\n\nThere was no doubt between them as to the meaning of each other. But\nthey both seemed to think it wise to have a little bit of vexing before\ndoing any more. And thus they looked at one another as if there was\nnothing between them. And all the time, how they were longing!\n\n\"I must have yes or no:\" for Rodney could not outlast the young lady:\n\"yes or no; you know what I mean. I am almost always at sea; and\nto-morrow I start to join Nelson. With him there is no play-work. I hope\nto satisfy him, though I know what he is to satisfy. But I hope to do\nit.\"\n\n\"Of course you will,\" Delushy answered. \"You seem to give great\nsatisfaction; almost everywhere, I am sure.\"\n\n\"Do I give it, you proud creature, where I long to give it most?\"\n\n\"How can I pretend to say, without being told in what latitude even--as\nI think your expression is--this amiable desire lies?\"\n\n\"As if you did not know, Delushy!\"\n\n\"As if I did know, Captain Bluett! And another thing--I am not to be\ncalled 'Delushy,' much, in that way.\"\n\n\"Very well, then; much in another way. Delushy, Delushy, delicious\nDelushy, what makes you so unkind to me? To-morrow I go away, and\nperhaps we shall never meet again, Delushy: and then how you would\nreproach yourself. Don't you think you would now?\"\n\n\"When never and then come together--yes. I suppose all sailors talk so.\"\n\n\"If I cannot even talk to please you, there is nothing more to say. I\nthink that the bards have turned your head with their harpings, and\ntheir fiddle-strings, and ballads (in very bad Welsh, no doubt) about\n'the charming maid of Sker;' and so on. When you are old enough to know\nbetter, and the young conceit wears out of you, you may be sorry, Miss\nAndalusia, for your wonderful cleverness.\"\n\nHe made her a bow with his handsome hat, and her warm young heart was\nchilled by it. Surely he ought to have shaken hands. She tried to keep\nher own meaning at home, and bid him farewell with a curtsy, while he\ntried not to look back again; but fortune or nature was too much for\nthem, and their eyes met wistfully.\n\nThese things are out of my line so much, that I cannot pretend to say\nnow for a moment what these very young people did; and everybody else\nhaving done the same, with more or less unwisdom, according to\nconstitution, may admire the power of charity which restrains me from\ndescribing them. My favourite writer of Scripture is St Paul, who was\nafraid of nobody, and who spent his time in making sails when the thorn\nin the flesh permitted him. And this great writer describes the quick\nmanners of maidens far better than I can. Wherefore I keep myself up\naloft until they have had a good spell of it.\n\n\"I have no opinion, now. What can you expect of me? Rodney, I must stop\nand think for nearly a quarter of a century before I have an opinion.\"\n\n\"Then stay, just so; and let me admire you, till I have to swim with\nyou.\"\n\n\"Rodney, you are reckless. Here comes the tide; and you know I have got\nmy very best Candleston side-lace boots on!\"\n\n\"Then come out of this rocky bower, which suits your fate so, darling;\nand let us talk most sensibly.\"\n\n\"By all means; if you think we can. There, you need not touch me,\nRodney;--I can get out very well indeed. I know these rocks better than\nyou do perhaps. Now sit on this rock where old David first hooked me, as\nI have heard that old chatterbox tell fifty times, as if he had done\nsome great great thing.\"\n\n\"He did indeed a grand grand thing. No wonder that he is proud of it.\nAnd he has so much to be proud of that you may take it for your highest\ncompliment. Perhaps there is no other man in the service--or I might say\nin all the civilised world----\" But it hurts me to tell what this\nexcellent officer said or even thought of me. He was such a first-rate\njudge by this time that I must leave his opinion blank.\n\nOver the sea they began to look, in a discontented quietude; as the\nmanner of young mortals is before they begin to know better, and with\ngreat ideas moving them. Bunny, with the very kindest discretion, had\nrun away entirely, and might now be seen at the far end of the sands,\nand springing up the rocks, on her way to Newton. So those two sate side\nby side, with their hearts full of one another, and their minds made up\nto face the world together, whatever might come of it. For as yet they\ncould see nothing clearly through the warm haze of loving, being wrapped\nup in an atmosphere which generally leads to a hurricane. But to them,\nfor a few short minutes, earth and sea and sky were all one universal\nheaven.\n\n\"It will not do,\" cried the maid of Sker, suddenly awaking with a short\ndeep sigh, and drawing back her delicate hand from the broad palm of\nyoung Rodney: \"it will never, never do. We must both be mad to think of\nit.\"\n\n\"Who could fail to be mad,\" he answered, \"if you set the example?\"\n\n\"Now, don't be so dreadfully stupid, Rodney. What I say is most serious.\nOf course you know the world better than I do, as you told me yesterday,\nafter sailing a dozen times round it. But I am thinking of other things.\nNot of what the world will say, but of what I myself must feel. And the\nfirst of these things is that I cannot be cruelly ungrateful. It would\nbe the deepest ingratitude to the Colonel if I went on with it.\"\n\n\"Went on with it! What a way to speak! As if you could be off with it\nwhen you pleased! And my good uncle loves you like his own daughter; and\nso does my mother. Now what can you mean?\"\n\n\"As if you did not know indeed! Now, Rodney, do talk sensibly. I ought\nto know, if any one does, what your uncle and your mother are. And I\nknow that they would rather see your death in the Gazette than your\nmarriage with an unknown, nameless nobody like me, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, of course, we must take the chance of that,\" said Captain Bluett,\ncarelessly. \"The Colonel is the best soul in the world, and my dear\nmother a most excellent creature, whenever she listens to reason. But as\nto my asking their permission--it is the last thing I should dream of. I\nam old enough to know my own mind, and to get my own living, I should\nhope, as well as that of my family. And if I am only in time with\nNelson, of course we shall do wonders.\"\n\nFor a minute or two the poor young maid had not a word to say to him.\nShe longed to throw her arms around him, when he spoke so proudly, and\nto indulge her own pride in him, as against all the world beside. But\nhaving been brought up in so much trouble, she had learned to check\nherself. So that she did nothing more than wait for him to go on again.\nAnd this he did with sparkling eyes and the confidence of a young\nBritish tar.\n\n\"There is another thing, my beauty, which they are bound to consider, as\nwell as all the prize-money I shall earn. And that is, that they have\nnobody except themselves to thank for it. They must have known what was\nsure to happen, if they chose to have you there whenever I was home from\nsea. And my mother is so clever too--to my mind it is plain enough that\nthey meant me to do what I have done.\"\n\n\"And pray what is that?\"\n\n\"As if you did not know! Come now, you must pay the penalty of asking\nfor a compliment. Talk about breeding and good birth, and that stuff!\nWhy, look at your hands and then look at mine. Put your fingers between\nmine--both hands, both hands--that's the way. Now just feel my great\nclumsy things, and then see how lovely yours are--as clear as\nwax-tapers, and just touched with rose, and every nail with a fairy\ngift, and pointed like an almond. A 'nameless nobody' indeed! What\nnameless nobody ever had such nails? By way of contrast examine mine.\"\n\n\"Oh but you bite yours shockingly, Rodney. I am sure that you do, though\nI never saw you. You must be cured of that dreadful trick.\"\n\n\"That shall be your first job, Delushy, when you are Mrs Rodney. Now for\nanother great sign of birth. Do you see any peak to my upper lip?\"\n\n\"No, I can't say I do. But how foolish you are! I ought to be crying,\nand you make me laugh.\"\n\n\"Then just let me show you the peak to yours. Honour bright--and no mean\nadvantages--that is to say if I can help it. Oh, here's that blessed\nMoxy coming! May the Frenchmen rob her hen-roost! Now just one promise,\ndarling, darling; just one little promise. To-morrow I go to most\ndesperate battles, and lucky to come home with one arm and one leg.\nTherefore, promise a solemn promise to have no one in the world but me.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said the maid, with her lips to his ear, in the true old\ncoaxing fashion, \"that I may very well promise that. But I will promise\nanother thing too. And that is, not to have even you, until your dear\nmother and good uncle come to me and ask me. And that can never never\nbe.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX.\n\nNELSON AND THE NILE.\n\n\nThe first day of August in the year of our Lord 1798 is a day to be long\nremembered by every Briton with a piece of constitution in him. For on\nthat day our glorious navy, under the immortal Nelson, administered to\nthe Frenchmen, under Admiral Brewer, as pure and perfect a lathering as\nis to be found in all history. This I never should venture to put upon\nmy own authority (especially after the prominent part assigned therein\nby Providence to a humble individual who came from Newton-Nottage), for\nwith history I have no patience at all, because it always contradicts\nthe very things I have seen and known: but I am bound to believe a man\nof such high principles and deep reading as Master Roger Berkrolles. And\nhe tells me that I have helped to produce the greatest of all great\nvictories.\n\nBe that one way or the other, I can tell you every word concerning how\nwe managed it; and you need not for one moment think me capable of\nprejudice. Quite the contrary, I assure you. There could not have been\nin the British fleet any man more determined to do justice to all\nCrappos, than a thoroughly ancient navigator, now master of the Goliath.\n\nWe knew exactly what to do, every Captain, every Master, every\nquarter-master; even the powder-monkeys had their proper work laid out\nfor them. The spirit of Nelson ran through us all; and our hearts caught\nfire from his heart. From the moment of our first glimpse at the\nFrenchmen spread out in that tempting manner, beautifully moored and\nriding in a long fine head and stern, every old seaman among us began to\ncount on his fingers prize-money. They thought that we would not fight\nthat night, for the sun was low when we found them; and with their\nperpetual conceit, they were hard at work taking water in. I shall never\nforget how beautiful these ships looked, and how peaceful. A French ship\nalways sits the water with an elegant quickness, like a Frenchwoman at\nthe looking-glass. And though we brought the evening breeze in very\nbriskly with us, there was hardly swell enough in the bay to make them\nplay their hawsers. Many fine things have I seen, and therefore know\npretty well how to look at them, which a man never can do upon the\nfirst or even the second occasion. But it was worth any man's while to\nlive to the age of threescore years and eight, with a sound mind in a\nsound body, and eyes almost as good as ever, if there were nothing for\nit more than to see what I saw at this moment. Six-and-twenty ships of\nthe line, thirteen bearing the tricolor, and riding cleared for action,\nthe other thirteen with the red cross flying, the cross of St George on\nthe ground of white, and tossing the blue water from their stems under\npressure of canvass. Onward rushed our British ships, as if every one of\nthem was alive, and driven out of all patience by the wicked escapes of\nthe enemy. Twelve hundred leagues of chase had they cost us, ingratitude\ntowards God every night, and love of the devil at morning, with dread of\nour country for ever prevailing, and mistrust of our own good selves.\nAnd now at last we had got them tight; and mean we did to keep them.\nCaptain Foley came up to me as I stood on the ratlines to hear the\nreport of the men in the starboard fore-chains; and his fine open face\nwas clouded. \"Master,\" he said, \"how much more of this? Damn your\nsoundings. Can't you see that the Zealous is drawing ahead of us? Hood\nhas nobody in the chains. If you can't take the ship into action, I\nwill. Stand by there to set top-gallant-sails.\"\n\nThese had been taken in, scarce five minutes agone, as prudence\ndemanded, for none of us had any chart of the bay; and even I knew\nlittle about it, except that there was a great shoal of rock betwixt\nAboukir island and the van ship of the enemy. And but for my warning, we\nmight have followed the two French brigs appointed to decoy us in that\ndirection. Now, having filled top-gallant-sails, we rapidly headed our\nrival the Zealous, in spite of all that she could do; and we had the\nhonour of receiving the first shot of the enemy. For now we were rushing\nin, stern on, having formed line of battle, towards the van of the\nanchored Frenchmen.\n\nNow as to what followed, and the brilliant idea which occurred to\nsomebody to turn the enemy's line and take them on the larboard or inner\nside (on which they were quite unprepared for attack), no two\nauthorities are quite agreed, simply because they all are wrong. Some\nattribute this grand man\u00c5\u0093uvre to our great Admiral Nelson, others to\nCaptain Hood of the Zealous, and others to our Captain Foley. This\nlatter is nearest the mark; but from whom did Captain Foley obtain the\nhint? Modesty forbids me to say what Welshman it was who devised this\nnoble and most decisive stratagem, while patriotic duty compels me to\nsay that it was a Welshman, and more than that a Glamorganshire man,\nborn in a favoured part of the quiet village of N--N--. Enough, unless I\nadd that internal evidence will convince any unprejudiced person that\nnone but an ancient fisherman, and thorough-going long-shore-man, could\nby any possibility have smelled out his way so cleverly.\n\nOur great Admiral saw, with his usual insight into Frenchmen, that if\nthey remained at anchor we were sure to man their capstans. For Crappos\nfight well enough with a rush, but unsteadily when at a standstill, and\nworst of all when taken by surprise and outman\u00c5\u0093uvred. And the manner in\nwhich the British fleet advanced was enough to strike them cold by its\nmajesty and its awfulness. For in perfect silence we were gliding over\nthe dark-blue sea, with the stately height of the white sails shining,\nand the sky behind us full of solemn yellow sunset. Even we, so sure of\nconquest, and so nerved with stern delight, could not gaze on the things\naround us, and the work before us, without for a moment wondering\nwhether the Lord in heaven looked down at us.\n\nAt any rate we obeyed to the letter the orders both of our Admiral and\nof a man scarcely less remarkable. \"Let not the sun go down on your\nwrath,\" are the very words of St Paul, I believe; and we never fired a\nshot until there was no sun left to look at it. I stood by the men at\nthe wheel myself, and laid my own hand to it: for it was a matter of\nvery fine steerage, to run in ahead of the French line, ware soundings,\nand then bear up on their larboard bow, to deliver a thorough good\nraking broadside. I remember looking over my left shoulder after we bore\nup our helm a-weather, while crossing the bows of the Carrier (as the\nforemost enemy's ship was called), and there was the last limb of the\nsun like the hoof of a horse disappearing. And my own head nearly went\nwith it, as the wind of a round-shot knocked me over. \"Bear up, bear up,\nlads,\" cried Captain Foley, \"our time has come at last, my boys! Well\ndone Llewellyn! A finer sample of conning and steerage was never seen.\nLet go the best bower. Pass the word. Ready at quarters all of you. Now\nshe bears clear fore and aft. Damn their eyes, let them have it.\"\n\nOut rang the whole of our larboard battery, almost like a single gun; a\nfiner thing was never seen; and before the ring passed into a roar, the\nyell of Frenchmen came through the smoke. Masts and spars flew right\nand left with the bones of men among them, and the sea began to hiss and\nheave, and the ships to reel and tremble, and the roar of a mad volcano\nrose, and nothing kept either shape or tenor, except the faces of brave\nmen.\n\nEvery ship in our fleet was prepared to anchor by the stern, so as to\nspring our broadsides aright; but the anchor of the Goliath did not bite\nso soon as it should have done, so that we ran past the Carrier, and\nbrought up on the larboard quarter of the second French 74, with a\nfrigate and a brig of war to employ a few of our starboard guns. By this\ntime the rapid darkness fell, and we fought by the light of our own\nguns. And now the skill of our Admiral and his great ideas were\nmanifest, for every French ship had two English upon it, and some of\nthem even three at a time. In a word, we began with the head of their\nline, and crushed it, and so on joint by joint, ere even the centre and\nmuch more the tail could fetch their way up to take part in it. Our\nantagonist was the first that struck, being the second of the\nFrenchman's line, and by name the Conquer-ant. But she found in Captain\nFoley and David Llewellyn an ant a little too clever to conquer. We were\na good deal knocked about, with most of our main rigging shot away, and\nall our masts heavily wounded. Nevertheless we drew ahead, to double\nupon the third French ship, of the wonderful name of Sparticipate.\n\nFrom this ship I received a shot, which, but for the mercy of the Lord,\nmust have made a perfect end of me. That my end may be perfect has long\nbeen my wish, and the tenor of my life leads up to it. Nevertheless, who\nam I to deny that I was not ready for the final finish at that very\nmoment? And now, at this time of writing, I find myself ready to wait a\nbit longer. What I mean was a chain-shot sailing along, rather slowly as\nthey always do; and yet so fast that I could not either duck or jump at\nsight of it, although there was light enough now for anything, with the\nFrench Admiral on fire. Happening to be well satisfied with my state of\nmind at that moment (not from congratulation, so much as from my inside\nconscience), I now was beginning to fill a pipe, and to dwell upon\nfurther man\u00c5\u0093uvres. For one of the foremost points of all, after\nthoroughly drubbing the enemy, is to keep a fine self-control, and be\nready to go on with it.\n\nNo sooner had I filled this pipe, and taken a piece of wadding to light\nit, which was burning handy (in spite of all my orders), than away went\na piece of me; and down went I, as dead as a Dutch herring. At least so\neverybody thought, who had time to think about it; and \"the Master's\ndead\" ran along the deck, so far as time was to tell of it. I must have\nlain numb for an hour, I doubt, with the roar of the guns, and the\nshaking of bulkheads, like a shiver, jarring me, and a pool of blood\ncurdling into me, and another poor fellow cast into the scuppers and\nclutching at me in his groaning, when the heavens took fire in one red\nblaze, and a thundering roar, that might rouse the dead, drowned all the\nrolling battle-din. I saw the white looks of our crew all aghast, and\ntheir bodies scared out of death's manufacture, by this triumph of\nmortality; and the elbows of big fellows holding the linstock fell\nquivering back to their shaken ribs. For the whole sky was blotched with\nthe corpses of men, like the stones of a crater cast upwards; and the\nsheet of the fire behind them showed their knees and their bellies, and\nstreaming hair. Then with a hiss, like electric hail, from a mile's\nheight, all came down again, corpses first (being softer things), and\ntimbers next, and then the great spars that had streaked the sky like\nrockets.\n\nThe violence of this matter so attracted my attention that I was enabled\nto rally my wits, and lean on one elbow and look at it. And I do assure\nyou that anybody who happened to be out of sight of it, lost a finer\nchance than ever he can have another prospect of. For a\nhundred-and-twenty-gun ship had blown up, with an Admiral and\nRear-Admiral, not to mention a Commodore, and at least 700 complement.\nAnd when the concussion was over, there fell the silence of death upon\nall men. Not a gun was fired, nor an order given, except to man the\nboats in hopes of saving some poor fellows.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXI.\n\nA SAVAGE DEED.\n\n\nNevertheless our Britons were forced to renew the battle afterwards;\nbecause those Frenchmen had not the manners to surrender as they should\nhave done. And they even compelled us to batter their ships so seriously\nand sadly, that when we took possession some were scarcely worth the\ntrouble. To make us blow up their poor Admiral was a distressing thing\nto begin with; but when that was done, to go on with the battle was as\nbad as the dog in the manger. What good could it do them to rob a poor\nBritish sailor of half his prize-money? And such conduct becomes at\nleast twice as ungenerous when they actually have wounded him!\n\nMy wound was sore, and so was I, on the following day, I can tell you;\nfor not being now such a very young man, I found it a precious hard\nthing to renew the power of blood that was gone from me. And after the\nterrible scene that awoke me from the first trance of carnage, I was\nthrown by the mercy of Providence into pure insensibility. This I am\nbound to declare; because the public might otherwise think itself\nwronged, and perhaps even vote me down as of no value, for failing to\ngive them the end of this battle so brilliantly as the beginning. I defy\nmy old rival, the Newton tailor (although a much younger man perhaps\nthan myself, and with my help a pretty good seaman), to take up the\ntucks of this battle as well as I have done,--though not well done. Even\nif a tailor can come up and fight (which he did, for the honour of\nCambria), none of his customers can expect any more than French-chalk\nflourishes when a piece of description is down in his books. However,\nlet him cut his cloth. He is still at sea, or else under it; and if he\never does come home, and sit down to his shop-board--as his wife says he\nis sure to do--his very first order shall be for a church-going coat,\nwith a doubled-up sleeve to it.\n\nFor the Frenchmen took my left arm away in a thoroughly lubberly manner.\nIf they had done it with a good cross-cut, like my old wound of forty\nyears' standing, I would at once have set it down to the credit of their\nnation. But when I came to dwell over the subject (as for weeks my duty\nwas), more and more clear to me it became, that instead of honour they\nhad now incurred a lasting national disgrace. The fellows who charged\nthat gun had been afraid of the recoil of it. Half a charge of powder\nmakes the vilest fracture to deal with--however, there I was by the\nheels, and now for nobler people. Only while my wound is green you must\nnot be too hard on me.\n\nThe Goliath was ordered to chase down the bay, on the morning after the\nbattle, together with the Theseus and a frigate called the Leader. This\nfrigate was commanded by the Honourable Rodney Bluett, now a\npost-captain, and who had done wonders in the height of last night's\ncombat. He had brought up in the most brazen-faced manner, without any\nsense of his metal, close below the starboard bow of the great\nthree-decker Orient and the quarter of the Franklin, and thence he fired\naway at both, while all their shot flew over him. And this was\nafterwards said to have been the cleverest thing done by all of us,\nexcept the fine helm and calm handling of H.M. ship Goliath.\n\nThe two ships, in chase of which we were despatched, ran ashore and\nsurrendered, as I was told afterwards (for of course I was down in my\nberth at the time, with the surgeon looking after me); and thus out of\nthirteen French sail of the line, we took or destroyed eleven. And as we\nbore up after taking possession, the Leader ran under our counter and\nhailed us, \"Have you a Justice of the Peace on board?\" Our Captain\nreplied that he was himself a member of the quorum, but could not attend\nto such business now as making of wills and so on. Hereupon Captain\nBluett came forward, and with a polite wave of his hat called out that\nCaptain Foley would lay him under a special obligation, as well as clear\nthe honour of a gallant naval officer, by coming on board of the Leader,\nto receive the deposition of a dying man. In ten minutes' time our good\nskipper stood in the cockpit of the Leader, while Captain Bluett wrote\ndown the confession of a desperately-wounded seaman, who was clearing\nhis conscience of perilous wrong before he should face his Creator. The\npoor fellow sate on a pallet propped up by the bulkhead and a pillow;\nthat is to say, if a man can sit who has no legs left him. A round shot\nhad caught him in the tuck of both thighs, and the surgeon could now do\nno more for him. Indeed he was only enabled to speak, or to gasp out his\nlast syllables, by gulps of raw brandy which he was taking, with great\ndraughts of water between them. On the other side of his dying bed stood\nCannibals Dick and Joe, howling, and nodding their heads from time to\ntime, whenever he lifted his glazing eyes to them for confirmation. For\nit was my honest and highly-respected friend, the poor Jack Wildman, who\nnow lay in this sad condition, upon the very brink of another world. And\nI cannot do better than give his own words, as put into shape by two\nclear-witted men, Captains Foley and Rodney Bluett. Only for the\nreader's sake I omit a great deal of groaning.\n\n\"_This is the solemn and dying delivery_ of me, known as 'Jack Wildman,'\nA.B. seaman of H.M. frigate Leader, now off the coast of Egypt, and\ndying through a hurt in battle with the Frenchmen. I cannot tell my\nname, or age, or where I was born, or anything about myself; and it\ndoes not matter, as I have nothing to leave behind me. Dick and Joe are\nto have my clothes, and my pay if there is any; and the woman that used\nto be my wife is to have my medals for good behaviour in the three\nbattles I have partaken of. My money would be no good to her, because\nthey never use it; but the women are fond of ornaments.\n\n\"I was one of a race of naked people, living in holes of the earth at a\nplace we did not know the name of. I now know that it was Nympton in\nDevonshire, which is in England, they tell me. No one had any right to\ncome near us, except the great man who had given us land, and defended\nus from all enemies.\n\n\"His name was Parson Chouane, I believe, but I do not know how to spell\nit. He never told us of a thing like God; but I heard of it every day in\nthe navy whenever my betters were angry. Also I learned to read\nwonderful writings; but I can speak the truth all the same.\n\n\"Ever since I began to be put into clothes, and taught to kill other\npeople, I have longed to tell of an evil thing which happened once among\nus. How long ago I cannot tell, for we never count time as you do, but\nit must have been many years back, for I had no hair on my body except\nmy head. We had a man then who took lead among us, so far as there was\nany lead; and I think that he thought himself my father, because he gave\nme the most victuals. At any rate we had no other man to come near him\nin any cunningness. Our master Chouane came down sometimes, and took a\npride in watching him, and liked him so much that he laughed at him,\nwhich he never did to the rest of us.\n\n\"This man, my father as I may call him, took me all over the great brown\nmoors one night in some very hot weather. In the morning we came to a\ngreat heap of houses, and hid in a copse till the evening. At dusk we\nset out again, and came to a great and rich house by the side of a\nriver. The lower port-holes seemed full of lights, and on the flat place\nin front of them a band of music--such as now I love--was playing, and\npeople were dancing. I had never heard such a thing before; and my\nfather had all he could do to keep me in the black trees out of sight of\nthem. And among the thick of the going about we saw our master Chouane\nin his hunting-dress.\n\n\"This must have been what great people call a 'masked ball,' I am sure\nof it; since I saw one, when, in the Bellona, there were many women\nsomewhere. But at the end of the great light place, looking out over\nthe water, there was a quiet shady place for tired people to rest a bit.\nWhen the whole of the music was crashing like a battle, and people going\nround like great flies in a web, my father led me down by the\nriver-side, and sent me up some dark narrow steps, and pointed to two\nlittle babies. The whole of the business was all about these, and the\nfestival was to make much of them. The nurse for a moment had set them\nupright, while she just spoke to a young sailor-man; and crawling, as\nall of us can, I brought down these two babies to my father; and one was\nheavy, and the other light.\n\n\"My father had scarcely got hold of them, and the nurse had not yet\nmissed them, when on the dark shore by the river-side, perhaps five\nfathoms under the gaiety, Parson Chouane came up to my father, and\nwhispered, and gave orders. I know not what they said, for I had no\nsense of tongues then, nor desired it; for we knew what we wanted by\nsigns, and sounds, and saved a world of trouble so. Only I thought that\nour master was angry at having the girl-child brought away. He wanted\nonly the boy perhaps, who was sleepy and knew nothing. But the\ngirl-child shook her hand at him, and said, 'E bad man, Bardie knows\n'a.'\n\n\"I--every one of us--was amazed--so very small----Oh, sir, I can tell\nyou no more, I think.\"\n\n\"Indeed then, but you must, my friend,\" cried Captain Foley, with spirit\nenough to set a dead man talking; \"finish this story, you thief of the\nworld, before you cheat the hangman. Two lovely childer stolen away from\na first-rate family to give a ball of that kind--and devil a bit you\nrepent of it!\"\n\nPoor dying Jack looked up at him, and then at the place where his legs\nshould have been, and he seemed ashamed for the want of them. Then he\nplayed with the sheet for a twitch or two, as if proud of his arms still\nremaining; and checked back the agony tempting him now to bite it with\nhis great white teeth.\n\n\"Ask the rest of us, Captain,\" he said; \"Joe, you know it; Dick, you\nknow it; now that I am telling you. The boy was brought up with us, and\nyou call him Harry Savage. I knew the great house when I saw it again.\nAnd I longed to tell the good old man there; but for the sake of our\npeople. Chouane would have destroyed them all. I was tempted after they\npelted me so, and the old man was so good to me; but something always\nstopped me, and I wanted poor Harry to go to Heaven----Oh, a little\ndrink of water!\"\n\nCaptain Foley was partly inclined to take a great deal of poor Jack's\nconfession for no more than the raving of a light-headed man; but Rodney\nBluett conjured him to take down every word of it. And when this young\nofficer spoke of his former chief and well-known friend, now Commodore\nSir Drake Bampfylde (being knighted for service in India), and how all\nhis life he had lain under a cloud by reason of this very matter, not\nanother word did our Captain need from him, but took up his pen again.\n\n\"I ought to have told,\" said the dying man slowly; \"only I could not\nbring myself. But now you will know, you will all know now. My father is\ndead; but Dick and Joe can swear that the boy is the baby. He had\nbeautiful clothes on, they shone in the boat; but the girl-child had on\nno more than a smock, that they might see her dancing. Our master did\nnot stay with us a minute, but pushed us all into a boat on the tide,\ncut the rope, and was back with the dancers. My father had learned just\nenough of a boat to keep her straight in the tide-way, and I had to lie\ndown over the babies, to keep their white clothes from notice. We went\nso fast that I was quite scared, having never been afloat before, so\nthere must have been a strong ebb under us. And the boat, which was\nwhite, must have been a very light one, for she heeled with every\nmotion. At last we came to a great broad water, which perhaps was the\nriver's mouth, with the sea beyond it. My father got frightened perhaps;\nand I know that I had been frightened long ago. By a turn of the eddy,\nwe scrambled ashore, and carried the boy-baby with us; but the boat\nbroke away with a lurch as we jumped, for we had not the sense to bring\nout the rope. In half a minute she was off to sea, and the girl-baby lay\nfast asleep in her stern. And now after such a long voyage in the dark,\nwe were scared so that we both ran for our lives, and were safe before\ndaybreak at Nympton.\n\n\"My father before we got home stripped off the little boy's clothes, and\nburied them in a black moor-hole full of slime, with a great white stone\nin the midst of it. And the child himself was turned over naked to herd\nwith the other children (for none of our women look after them), and\nnobody knew or cared to know who he was, or whence he came, except my\npoor father, and our master--and I myself, many years afterwards. But\nnow I know well, and I cannot have quiet to die, without telling\nsomebody. The boy-baby I was compelled to steal was Sir Philip\nBampfylde's grandson, and the baby-girl his granddaughter. I never heard\nwhat became of her. She must have been drowned, or starved, most likely.\nBut as for the boy, he kept up his life; and the man who took us most in\nhand, of the name of 'Father David,' gave the names to all of us, and\nthe little one 'Harry Savage,' now serving on board of the Vanguard. I\nknow nothing of the buried images found by Father David. My father had\nnothing to do with that. It may have been another of Chouane's plans. I\nknow no more of anything. There, let me die; I have told all I know. I\ncan write my nickname. I never had any other--_Jack Wildman_.\"\n\nAt the end of this followed the proper things, and the forms the law is\nmade of, with first of all the sign-manual of our noble Captain Foley,\nwho must have been an Irishman, to lead us into the battle of the Nile,\nwhile in the commission of the Peace. And after him Captain Bluett\nsigned, and two or three warrant-officers gifted with a writing elbow;\nand then a pair of bare-bone crosses, meaning Cannibals Dick and Joe,\nwho could not speak, and much less write, in the depth of their\nemotions.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXII.\n\nA RASH YOUNG CAPTAIN.\n\n\nNow if I had been sewn up well in a hammock, and cast overboard (as the\nsurgeon advised), who, I should like to know, would have been left\ncapable of going to the bottom of these strange proceedings? Hezekiah\nwas alive, of course, and prepared to swear to anything, especially\nafter a round-shot must have killed him, but for his greasiness. And\nclever enough no doubt he was, and suspicious, and busy-minded, and\nexpecting to have all Wales under his thumb, because he was somewhere\nabout on the skirts of the great battle I led them into. But granting\nhim skill, and that narrow knowledge of the world which I call\n\"cunning;\" granting him also a restless desire to get to the bottom of\neverything, and a sniffing sense like a turnspit-dog's, of the shank-end\nbone he is roasting,--none the more for all that could we grant him the\ndownright power, now loudly called for, to put two and two together.\n\nHappily for all parties, poor Hezekiah was not required to make any\nfurther fool of himself. The stump of my arm was in a fine condition\nwhen ordered home with the prizes; and as soon as I felt the old Bay of\nBiscay, over I knocked the doctor. He fitted me with a hook after this,\nin consistence with an old fisherman; and now I have such a whole boxful\nof tools to screw on, that they beat any hand I ever had in the\nworld--if my neighbours would only not borrow them.\n\nTush--I am railing at myself again! Always running down, and holding up\nmyself to ridicule, out of pure contrariety, just because every one else\novervalues me. There are better men in the world than myself; there are\nwiser; there are braver;--I will not be argued down about it--there are\nsome (I am sure) as honest, in their way; and a few almost as truthful.\nHowever, I never yet did come across any other man half so modest. This\nI am forced to allude to now, in departure from my usual practice,\nbecause this quality and nothing else had prevented me from dwelling\nupon, and far more from following up, some shrewd thoughts which had\noccurred to me, loosely, I own, and in a random manner,--still they had\noccurred to me once or twice, and had been dismissed. Why so? Simply\nbecause I trusted other men's judgment, and public impression, instead\nof my own superior instinct, and knowledge of weather and tideways.\n\nHow bitterly it repented me now of this ill-founded diffidence, when, as\nwe lay in the Chops of the Channel about the end of October, with a\nnasty head-wind baffling us, Captain Rodney Bluett came on board of us\nfrom the Leader! He asked if the doctor could report the Master as\nstrong enough to support an interview; whereupon our worthy bone-joiner\nlaughed, and showed him into me where I sate at the latter end of a fine\naitch-bone of beef. And then Captain Rodney produced his papers, and\ntold me the whole of his story. I was deeply moved by Jack Wildman's\ndeath, though edified much by the manner of it, and some of his last\nobservations. For a naked heathen to turn so soon into a trousered\nChristian, and still more a good fore-top-man, was an evidence of\nunusual grace, even under such doctrine as mine was. Captain Bluett\nspoke much of this, although his religious convictions were not by any\nmeans so intense as mine, while my sinews were under treatment; but even\nwith only one arm and a quarter I seemed to be better fitted to handle\nevents than this young Captain was. His ability was of no common order,\nas he had proved by running his frigate under the very chains of the\nthundering big Frenchman, so that they could not be down on him. And yet\nhe could not see half the bearings of Jack Wildman's evidence. We had a\nlong talk, with some hot rum-and-water, for the evenings already were\nchilly; and my natural candour carried me almost into too much of it.\nAnd the Honourable Rodney gazed with a flush of colour at me, when I\ngave him my opinions like a raking broadside.\n\n\"You may be right,\" he said; \"you were always so wonderful at a long\nshot, Llewellyn. But really it does seem impossible.\"\n\n\"Captain,\" I answered; \"how many things seem so, yet come to pass\ncontinually!\"\n\n\"I cannot gainsay you, Llewellyn, after all my experience of the world.\nI would give my life to find it true. But how are we to establish it?\"\n\n\"Leave me alone for that, Captain Bluett; if it can be done it shall be\ndone. The idea is entirely my own, remember. It had never occurred to\nyou, had it?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" he replied, with his usual downright honesty; \"my\nreason for coming to you with that poor fellow's dying testimony was\nchiefly to cheer you up with the proofs of our old Captain's innocence,\nand to show you the turn of luck for young Harry, who has long been so\nshamefully treated. And now I have another thing to tell you about him;\nthat is if you have not heard it.\"\n\n\"No, I have heard nothing at all. I did not even know what had become of\nhim, until you read Jack's confession. With Nelson, on board the\nVanguard!\"\n\n\"That was my doing,\" said the Honourable Rodney. \"I recommended him to\nvolunteer, and he was accepted immediately, with the character I gave\nhim. But it is his own doing, and proud I am of it, that he is now\njunior lieutenant of Admiral Lord Nelson's own ship the Vanguard. Just\nbefore Nelson received his wound, and while powder was being handed up,\nthere came a shell hissing among them, and hung with a sputtering fuse\nin the coil of a cable, and the men fell down to escape it. But young\nHarry with wonderful quickness leaped (as he did, to save me in San\nDomingo), and sent the fuse over the side with a dash. Then Nelson came\nup, for the firing was hot, and of course he must be in the thick of\nit, and he saw in a moment what Harry had done, and he took down his\nname for promotion, being just what himself would have loved to do. It\nwill have to be confirmed, of course; but of that there can be no\nquestion, after all that we have done; and when it turns out who he is.\"\n\n\"I am heartily glad of it, Captain,\" I cried; \"the boy was worthy of any\nrank. Worth goes a little way; birth a long way. But all these things\nhave to be lawfully proven.\"\n\n\"Oh, you old village-lawyer; as we used to call you, at Old Newton. And\nyou deserved it, you rogue, you did. You may have lost your left hand;\nbut your right has not lost its cunning.\" He spoke in the purest play\nand jest; and with mutual esteem we parted. Only I stipulated for a good\ntalk with him about our measures, when I should have determined them; or\nat the latest on reaching port.\n\nThe boldest counsel is often the best, and naturally recommends itself\nto a man of warlike character. My first opinion, especially during the\nindignant period, was that nothing could be wiser, or more spirited, or\nmore striking, than to march straight up to Parson Chowne and confront\nhim with all this evidence, taken down by a magistrate, and dare him to\ndeny it; and then hale him off to prison, and (if the law permitted)\nhang him. That this was too good for him, every one who has read my\nwords must acknowledge; the best thing, moreover, that could befall him;\nfor his body was good, though his soul was bad; and he might have some\nhopes to redeem the latter at the expense of the former. And if he had\nnot, through life, looked forward to hanging as his latter end and\nsalvation, it is quite impossible to account for the licence he allowed\nhimself.\n\nHowever, on second thoughts I perceived that the really weighty concern\nbefore us, and what we were bound to think first of, was to restore such\na fine old family to its health and happiness. To reinstate, before he\ndied, that noble and most kind-hearted man, full of religious feeling\nalso, and of confidence that the Lord having made a good man would look\nafter him--which is the very spirit of King David, when his self-respect\nreturns--in a word, to replace in the world's esteem, and (what matters\nfar more) in true family love, that fine and pure old gentleman, the\nmuch-troubled Sir Philip Bampfylde,--this, I say, was the very first\nduty of a fellow nursed by a general and a baronet through the\nsmall-pox; while it was also a feat well worthy of the master of a\nline-of-battle ship, which was not lost in the battle of the Nile. And\nscarcely second even to this was the duty and joy of restoring to their\nproper rank in life two horribly injured and innocent creatures, one of\nwhom was our own Bardie. Therefore, upon the whole, it seemed best to go\nto work very warily.\n\nSo it came to pass that I followed my usual practice of wholly\nforgetting myself; and receiving from the Honourable Rodney Bluett that\nmost important document, I sewed it up in the watered silk-bag with my\ncaul and other muniments, and set out for Narnton Court, where I found\nboth Polly, and the cook, and the other comforts. But nothing would do\nfor our Captain Rodney--all young men are so inconsiderate--except to be\noff at racing speed for Candleston Court, and his sweetheart Delushy,\nand the excellent Colonel's old port wine. And as he was so brisk, I\nwill take him first, with your good leave, if ever words of mine can\nkeep up with him. But of course you will understand that I tell what\ncame to my knowledge afterwards.\n\nWith all the speed of men and horses, young Rodney Bluett made off for\nhome, and when he got there his luck was such as to find Delushy in the\nhouse. It happened to be her visiting time, according to the old\narrangement, and this crafty sailor found it out from the fine old woman\nat the lodge. So what did he do but discharge his carriage, and leave\nall his kit with her, and go on, with the spright foot of a mariner, to\nthe ancient house which he knew so well. Then this tall and bold young\nCaptain entered by the butler's door, the trick of which was well known\nto him, and in a room out of the lobby he stood, without his own mother\nknowing it. It was the fall of autumnal night, when everything is so\nrich and mellow, when the waning daylight ebbs, like a great spring-tide\nexhausted, into the quickening flow of starlight. And the plates were\nbeing cleared away after a snug dinner-party.\n\nThe good Colonel sat at the head of his table, after the ladies'\nwithdrawal, with that modest and graceful kindliness, which is the sure\nmark of true blood. Around him were a few choice old friends, such as\nonly good men have; friends, who would scout the evidence of their own\neyes against him. According to our fine old fashion, these were drinking\nhealths all round, not with undue love of rare port, so much as with\ntruth and sincerity.\n\nRodney made a sign to Crumpy (who had been shaking him by both hands,\nuntil the tears prevented him), just to please to keep all quiet\ntouching his arrival; and to let him have a slice or two of the haunch\nof venison put to grill, if there was any left of it, and give it him\nall on a plate: together with a twelve-pound loaf of farmhouse bread,\nsuch as is not to be had outside of Great Britain. This was done in\nabout five minutes (for even Mrs Cook respected Crumpy); and being\nserved up, with a quart of ale, in Crumpy's own head privacy, it had\nsuch a good effect that the Captain was ready to face anybody.\n\nOld Crumpy was a most crafty old fellow--which was one reason why I\nliked him, as a contrast to my frankness--and he managed it all, and\nkept such a look-out, that no one suspected him of any more than an\nhonoured old chum in his stronghold. Captain Bluett also knew exactly\nwhat his bearings were, and from a loftier point of view than would ever\noccur to Crumpy. A man who had carried a 50-gun ship right under the\nlower port-holes of a 120-gun enemy, and without any orders to that\neffect, and only from want of some easier business, he (I think) may be\ntrusted to get on in almost anything.\n\nThis was the very thing--I do believe--occurring to the mind of somebody\nsitting, as nearly as might be now, upon a very beautiful sofa. The\nloveliest work that you can imagine lay between her fingers; and she was\ndoing her very best to carry it on consistently. But on her lap lay a\nLondon paper, full of the highest authority; and there any young eyes\nmight discover a regular pit-pat of tears.\n\n\"My dear, my dear,\" said Lady Bluett, being not so very much better\nherself, although improved by spectacles; \"it is a dreadful, dreadful\nthing to think of those poor Frenchmen killed, so many at a time, and\nall in their sins. I do hope they had time to think, ever so little, of\ntheir latter end. It makes me feel quite ill to think of such a dreadful\ncarnage, and to know that my own son was foremost in it. Do you think,\nmy dear, that your delicate throat would be any worse in the morning, if\nyou were to read it once more to me? The people in the papers are so\nclever; and there was something I did not quite catch about poor\nRodney's recklessness. How like his dear father, to be sure! I see him\nin every word of it.\"\n\n\"Auntie, the first time I read it was best. The second and third time, I\ncried worse and worse; and the fourth time, you know what you said of\nme. And I know that I deserved it, Auntie, for having such foolish weak\neyes like that. You know what I told you about Captain Rodney, and\nbegged you to let me come here no more. And you know what you said--that\nit was a child's fancy; and if it were not, it should take its course.\nThe Colonel was wiser. Oh, Auntie, Auntie! why don't you always harken\nhim!\"\n\n\"For a very good reason, my dear child--he always proves wrong in the\nend; and I don't. I have the very highest and purest respect for my dear\nbrother's judgment. Every one knows what his mind is, and every one\nvalues his judgment. And no stranger, of course, can enter into him, his\nviews, and his largeness, and intellect; as I do, when I agree with him.\nThere, you have made me quite warm, my dear; I am so compelled to\nvindicate him.\"\n\n\"I am so sorry--I did not mean--you know what I am, Auntie.\"\n\n\"My dear, I know what you are, and therefore it is that I love you so.\nNow go and wash your pretty eyes, and read that again to me, and to the\nColonel. Many mothers would be proud perhaps. I feel no pride whatever,\nbecause my son could not help doing it.\"\n\nThere was something else this excellent lady's son could not help doing.\nHe caught the beautiful maid of Sker in her pure white dress in a nook\nof the passage, and with tears of pride for him rolling from her dark\ngrey eyes, and he could not help--but all lovers, I trow, know how much\nto expect of him.\n\n\"Thank you, Rodney,\" Delushy cried; \"to a certain extent, I am grateful.\nBut, if you please, no more of it. And you need not suppose that I was\ncrying about, about,--about anything.\"\n\n\"Of course not, you darling. How long have I lived, not to know that\ngirls cry about nothing? nine times out of ten at least. Pearly tears,\nnow prove your substance.\"\n\n\"Rodney, will you let me alone? I am not a French decker of 500 guns,\nfor you to do just what you like with. And I don't believe any one knows\nyou are here. Yes, yes, yes! Ever so many darlings, if you like--and\n'with my whole heart I do love you,' as darling Moxy says. But one\nthing, this moment, I insist upon--no, not in your ear, nor yet through\nyour hair, you conceited curly creature; but at the distance of a yard I\npronounce that you shall come to your mother.\"\n\n\"Oh, what a shame!\" And with that unfilial view of the subject, he\nrendered himself, after all those mortal perils, into the arms of his\nmother. With her usual quickness Delushy fled, but came back to the\ndrawing-room very sedately, and with a rose-coloured change of dress, in\nabout half an hour afterwards.\n\n\"How do you do, Captain Rodney Bluett?\"\n\n\"Madam, I hope that I see you well.\"\n\nLady Bluett was amazed at the coolness of them, and in her heart\ndisappointed; although she was trying to argue it down, and to say to\nherself, \"How wise of them!\" She knew how the Colonel loved this young\nmaid, yet never could bear to think of his nephew taking to wife a mere\nwaif of the sea. The lady had faith in herself that she might in the end\novercome this prejudice. But of course if the young ones had ceased to\ncare for it, she could only say that young people were not of the stuff\nthat young people used to be.\n\nWhile she revolved these things in her tender, warm, and motherly bosom,\nthe gentlemen came from the dining-room, to pay their compliments to the\nladies, and to have their tea and all that, according to the recent\nstyle of it. They bowed very decently, as they came in, not being topers\nby any means: and the lady of the house arose and curtsied to them most\ngracefully. Then Rodney, who had found occasion ere this to salute\nColonel Lougher and his visitors, led forward the maid, and presented\nher to them, with a very excellent naval bow.\n\n\"My dear uncle, and friends of the family,\" he began, while she trembled\na little, and looked at him with astonishment; \"allow me the favour of\npresenting to you a lady who will do me the honour of becoming my wife,\nvery shortly, I hope.\"\n\nThe Colonel drew back with a frown on his face. Lady Bluett on the other\nhand ran up.\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" she cried. \"And not a word of it to your\nown mother! Oh, Andalusia, how shocking of you!\"\n\n\"I think, sir,\" said the Colonel, looking straight at the youth, \"that\nyou might have chosen a better moment to defy your uncle, than in the\npresence of his oldest friends. It is not like a gentleman, sir. It cuts\nme to the heart to say such a thing to the son of my own sister. But,\nsir, it is not like a gentleman.\"\n\nThe old friends nodded to one another, in approval of this sentiment;\nand turned to withdraw from a family scene.\n\n\"Wait, if you please,\" cried Rodney Bluett. \"Colonel Lougher, I should\ndeserve your reproach, if I had done anything of the kind. My intention\nis not to defy you, sir; but to please you and gratify you, my dear\nuncle, as your lifelong kindness to me and to this young lady deserves.\nAnd I have chosen to do it before old friends, that your pleasure may be\nincreased by their congratulations. Instead of being ashamed, sir, of\nthe origin of your future niece--or you my dear mother of your daughter,\nyou may well be proud of it. She belongs to one of the oldest families\nin the West of England. She is the grandchild of Sir Philip Bampfylde of\nNarnton Court, near Barnstaple. And I think I have heard my mother speak\nof him as an old friend of my father.\"\n\n\"To be sure, to be sure!\" exclaimed Lady Bluett, ere the Colonel could\nrecover himself: \"the Bluetts are an old west-country family; but the\nBampfyldes even older. Come to me, my pretty darling. There, don't cry\nso; or if you must, come in here, and I will help you. Rodney, my dear,\nyou have delighted us, and you have done it most cleverly. But excuse my\nsaying that an officer in the army would have known a little better what\nladies are, than to have thrown them into this excitement, even in the\npresence of valued friends. Come here, my precious. The gentlemen will\nexcuse us for a little while.\"\n\n\"Let me kiss Colonel Lougher first,\" whispered Delushy; all frightened,\ncrying, and quivering as she was, she could not forget her gratitude. So\nshe bowed her white forehead, and drooped her dark lashes under the old\nman's benevolent gaze.\n\n\"Sit down, my dear friends,\" said Colonel Lougher, as soon as the ladies\nhad left the room. \"My good nephew's tactics have been rather blunt, and\nof the Aboukir order. However, he may be quite right if this matter\nrequires at once to be spread abroad. At any rate, my dear boy, I owe\nyou an apology. Rodney, I beg your pardon for the very harsh terms I\nused to you.\"\n\nWith these words he stood up, and bowed to his nephew; who did the same\nto him in silence, and then they shook hands warmly. After which the\nyoung Captain told his story, to which they all listened intently--five\nbeing justices of the shire, and one the lord-lieutenant--all accustomed\nto examine evidence.\n\n\"It seems very likely,\" said Colonel Lougher, as they waited for his\nopinion. \"That David Llewellyn is a most shrewd fellow. But he ought to\nhave said more about the boat. There is one thing, however, to be done\nat once--to collect confirmative evidence.\"\n\n\"There is another thing to be done at once,\" cried Rodney Bluett,\nwarmly--\"to pull Chowne's nose. And despite his cloth, I will do it\nroundly.\"\n\n\"My young friend,\" said the Lord-Lieutenant; \"prove it first. And then,\nI think, there are some people who would pardon you.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIII.\n\nPOLLY AT HOME.\n\n\nLest any one should be surprised that Sir Philip Bampfylde could have\npaid two visits to this delightful neighbourhood, without calling on our\nleading gentleman, and his own fellow-officer, Colonel Lougher--in which\ncase the questions concerning Delushy would have been sifted long ago--I\nhad better say at once what it was that stopped him. When the General\nthought it just worth while, though his hopes were faint about it, to\ninquire into the twisted story of the wreck on our coast, as given by\nthe celebrated Felix Farley; the first authority he applied to was\nCoroner Bowles, who had held the inquest. Coroner Bowles told him all he\nknew (half of which was wrong, of course, by means of Hezekiah) and gave\nhim a letter to Anthony Stew, as the most active and penetrating\nmagistrate of the neighbourhood. Nothing could have been more unlucky.\nNot only did Stew baffle my desire to be more candid than the day\nitself, by his official brow-beating, and the antipathy between us--not\nonly did Stew, like an over-sharp fellow, trust one of the biggest\nrogues unhung--in his unregenerate dissenting days, and before we gave\nhim six dozen, which certainly proved his salvation--(I am sorry to say\nsuch things of my present good neighbour, 'Kiah; but here he is now, and\nsubscribes to it) Hezekiah Perkins, whose view of the shipwreck, and\nlearned disquisition on sand, misled the poor Coroner and all of the\nJury, except myself, so blindly, that we drowned the five young men, and\nsmothered the baby--not only did Stew, I say, get thus far in\nbewilderment of the subject, but he utterly ruined all chance of\nclearing it, by keeping Sir Philip from Candleston Court!\n\nIf you ask me how, I can only say, in common fairness to Anthony Stew\n(who is lately gone, poor fellow, to be cross-examined by somebody\nsharper even than himself--one to whom I would never afford material for\nunpleasant questions, by speaking amiss of a man in his\npower--especially when so needless), in a word, to treat Stew as I hope\nmyself to be treated by survivors, I admit that he may not have wished\nto keep Sir Philip away from the Colonel. But the former having once\naccepted Stew's keen hospitality, and tried to eat fish (which I might\nhave bettered, had I known of his being there), felt, with his usual\ndelicacy, that he ought not to visit a man at feud with the host whose\nsalt--and very little else--he was then enjoying. For Mrs Stew was more\nbitter of course than even her husband against Colonel Lougher, and\nroundly abused him the very first evening of Sir Philip's stay with\nthem. So that the worthy General passed the gates of the excellent\nColonel, half-a-dozen times perhaps, without once passing through them.\n\nEnough about that; and I need only say, before returning to my own\nimportant and perhaps sagacious inquiries in Devonshire, that the news,\nso hastily blurted out by Captain Rodney Bluett, caused many glad hearts\nin our parish and neighbourhood; but nevertheless two sad ones. Of these\none belonged to Roger Berkrolles, and the other to Moxy Thomas. The\nchild had so won upon both these, not only by her misfortunes and the\nway in which she bore them, but by her loving disposition, bright\nmanner, and docility, that it seemed very hard to lose her so, even\nthough it were for her own good. Upon this latter point Master\nBerkrolles, when I came to see him, held an opinion, the folly of which\nsurprised me, from a man of such reading and history. In real earnest he\nlaid down that it might be a very bad thing for the maid, and make\nagainst her happiness, to come of a sudden into high position,\nimportance, and even money. Such sentiments are to be found, I believe,\nin the weaker parts of the Bible, such as are called the New Testament,\nwhich nobody can compare to the works of my ancestor, King David; and\nwhich, if you put aside Saint Paul, and Saint Peter (who cut the man's\near off, and rejected quite rightly the table-cloth), exhibit to my mind\nnobody of a patriotic spirit.\n\nAs for Moxy, she would not have been a woman if she had doubted about\nthe value of high position, coin of the realm, and rich raiment.\nNevertheless she cried bitterly that this child, as good as her own to\nher, and given her to make up for them, and now so clever to see to\nthings, and to light the fire, and show her the way Lady Bluett put her\ndress on, should be taken away in a heap as it were, just as if the\ngreat folk had minded her. She blamed our poor Bunny for stealing the\nheart of young Watkin, who might have had the maid (according to his\nmother's fancy) with money enough to restock the farm, now things had\nproved so handsome. As if everybody did not know that Bardie would never\nthink twice of Watkin; while his mother, hearing of the ships I had\ntaken (as all over the parish reported), had put poor Watkin on bread\nand water, until he fell in love with Bunny! However, now she cried very\nseverely, and in a great measure she meant it.\n\nLeaving all Newton, and Nottage, and Sker, and even Bridgend to consider\nthese matters, with a pleasing divergence of facts and conclusions, I\nfind it my duty, however repugnant, to speak once more of my humble\nself. In adversity, my native dignity and the true grandeur of Cambria\nhave always united, against my own feelings, to make me almost\nself-confident, or at any rate able to maintain my position, and knock\nunder to nobody. But in prosperity, all this drops; extreme affability,\nand my native longing to give pleasure, mark my deportment towards all\nthe world; and I almost never commit an assault.\n\nIn this fine and desirable frame of mind I arrived at Narnton Court once\nmore, sooner perhaps than Captain Bluett, having so much further to go,\nburst in on his friends at Candleston; although I have given his story\nprecedence, not only on account of his higher rank, but because of the\nhurry he was in. On the other hand, my part seemed to be of a nice and\ndelicate character--to find out all that I could without making any\nnoise in the neighbourhood, to risk no chance, if it might be helped, of\nexciting Sir Philip Bampfylde, and, above all things, no possibility of\narousing Chowne, till the proper time. For his craft was so great that\nhe might destroy every link of evidence, if he once knew that we were in\nchase of him; even as he could out-fox a fox.\n\nWhen things of importance take their hinge, a good deal, upon feminine\nevidence, the first thing a wise man always does is to seek female\ninstinct, if he sees his way to guide it. And to have the helm of a\nwoman, nothing is so certain as a sort of a promise of marriage. A man\nneed not go too very far, and must be awake about pen and ink, and\nwitnesses, and so on; but if he knows how to do it, and has lost an arm\nin battle, but preserved an unusually fine white beard, and has had\nanother wife before, who was known to make too little of him, the fault\nis his own if he cannot manage half-a-dozen spinsters.\n\nMy reputation had outrun me--as it used to do, sometimes too often--for\nin the despatches my name came after scarcely more than fifty, though it\nshould have been one of the foremost five; however, my wound was\nhandsomely chronicled, and with a touch of my own description, such as\nis really heartfelt. Of course it was not quite cured yet, and I felt\nvery shy about it; and the very last thing I desired was for the women\nto come bothering. Tush! I have no patience with them; they make such a\nfuss of a trifle.\n\nBut being bound upon such an errand, and anxious to conciliate them so\nfar as self-respect allowed, and knowing that if I denied myself to\nthem, the movement would be much greater, I let them have peeps, and\nperceive at the same time that I really did want a new set of shirts.\nHalf-a-dozen of damsels began at once to take my measure: and the result\nwill last my lifetime.\n\nBut, amid all this glorification, whenever I thought of settling, there\nwas one pretty face that I longed to see, and to my mind it beat the\nwhole of them. What was become of my pretty Polly, the lover of my\ntruthful tales, and did she still remember a brave, though not young\nofficer in the Navy, who had saved her from the jaws of death, by\ncatching small-pox from her? These questions were answered just in time,\nand in the right manner also, by the appearance of Polly herself,\noutblushing the rose at sight of me, and without a spot on her face,\nexcept from the very smart veil she was wearing. For she was no longer a\nservant now, but free and independent, and therefore entitled to take\nthe veil, and she showed her high spirit by doing this, to the deep\nindignation of all our maid-servants. And still more indignant were\nthese young women, when Polly demeaned herself, as they declared, with a\nperfectly shameless and brazen-faced manner of carrying on towards the\nnoble old tar. They did not allow for the poor thing's gratitude to the\nonly one who came nigh her in her despairing hour and saved her life\nthereby, nor yet for her sorrow and tender feeling at the dire\nconsequence to him; and it was not in their power, perhaps, to\nsympathise with the shock she felt at my maimed and war-beaten\nappearance. However, I carried the whole of it off in a bantering\nmanner, as usual.\n\nStill there was one resolution I came to, after long puzzling in what\nway to cope with the almost fatal difficulty of having to trust a\nwoman. So I said to myself, that if this must be done, I might make it\nserve two purposes--first for discovery of what I sought, and then for a\ntest of the value of a female, about whom I had serious feelings. These\nwere in no way affected by some news I picked up from Nanette, or, as\nshe now called herself, \"The widow Heaviside.\" Not that my old friend\nhad left this world, but that he gave a wide berth to the part\ncontaining his beloved partner. She, with a Frenchwoman's wit and\nsagacity, saw the advantage of remaining in the neighbourhood of her\nwrongs; and here with the pity now felt for her, and the help she\nreceived from Sir Philip himself, and her own skill in getting up\nwomen's fal lals, she maintained her seven children cleverly.\n\nAfter shedding some natural tears for the admired but fugitive\nHeaviside, she came round, of course, to her neighbours' affairs; and\nthough she had not been at Narnton Court at the time when the children\nwere stolen, she helped me no little by telling me where to find one who\nknew all that was known of it. This was a farmer's wife now at\nBurrington (as I found out afterwards), a village some few leagues up\nthe Tawe, and her name was Mrs Shapland.\n\n\"From her my friend the Captain shall decouver the everything of this\nhorrible affair,\" said Nanette, who now spoke fine English. \"She was\nthe--what you call--the bonne, the guard of the leetle infants. I know\nnot where she leeves, some barbarous name. I do forget--but she have one\ncousin, a jolly girl, of the leetle name--pray how can you make such\nthing of 'Mary?'\"\n\n\"What! do you mean Polly?\" I asked; \"that is what we make of Mary. And\nwhat Polly is it then, Madame?\"\n\n\"Yes, Paullee, the Paullee which have that horrible pest that makes\nholes in the faces. 'Verole' we call it. The Paullee that was in the\ngreat mansion, until she have the money left, the niece of the proud\nwoman of manage. You shall with great facility find that Paullee.\" Of\ncourse I could, for she had told me where I might call upon her, which I\ndid that very same afternoon.\n\nAnd a pretty and very snug cottage it was, just a furlong, or so, above\nthe fine old village of Braunton, with four or five beautiful meadows\naround it, and a bright pebbly brook at the turn of the lane. The\ncottage itself, even now in November, was hung all over with China\nroses, and honeysuckle in its second bloom, which it often shows in\nDevonshire. And up at the window, that shook off the thatch, and looked\nwide-awake as a dog's house, a face, more bright than the roses, came,\nand went away, and came again, to put a good face upon being caught.\n\nHereupon I dismissed the boys, who, with several rounds of cheers, had\nescorted me through Braunton; and with genuine thankfulness I gazed at\nthe quiet and pleasing prospect. So charming now in the fall of the\nleaf, what would it be in the spring-time, with the meadows all breaking\nanew into green, and the trees all ready for their leaves again? Also\nthese bright red Devonshire cows, all belonging to Polly, and even now\nstreaming milkily--a firkin apiece was the least to expect of them, in\nthe merry May month. A very deep feeling of real peace, and the pleasure\nof small things fell on me; for a man of so many years, and one arm,\nmight almost plead to himself some right to shed his experience over the\nearth, when his blood had been curdling on so many seas.\n\nThe very same thought was in Polly's eyes when she ran down and opened\nthe door for me. The whole of this property was her own; or would be, at\nleast, when her old grandmother would allow herself to be buried. That\nold woman now was ninety-five, if the parsons had minded the register;\nand a woman more fully resolved to live on I never had the luck to meet\nwith. And the worst of it was, that her consent to Polly's marriage was\nneedful, under the ancient cow-keeper's will, with all of the meadows so\ndescribed, that nobody could get out of them. Hereupon, somehow, I\nmanaged to see that a very bold stroke was needed. And I took it, and\nwon the old lady over, by downright defiance. I told her that she was a\ngreat deal too young to have any right to an opinion; and when she\nshould come to my time of life, she would find me ready to hearken her.\nShe said that no doubt it was bred from the wars for sailors to talk so\nbravely; but that I ought to know better--with a fie, and a sigh, and a\nfie again. To none of this would I give ear, but began to rebuke all the\nyoung generations, holding to ridicule those very points upon which they\nespecially plume themselves, until this most excellent woman began to\ncount all her cows on her fingers.\n\n\"Her can't have them. No, her shan't have they,\" she cried, with a power\nwhich proved that she saw them dropping into my jaws almost; \"her han't\na got 'em yet; and why should her have 'em?\"\n\nInto this very fine feeling and sense of possession I entered so\namiably, that amid much laughter and many blushes on the part of Polly\n(who pretended to treat the whole thing as a joke), the old lady put on\nher silver goggles, and set down her name to a memorandum, prepared on\nthe spur of the moment by me. Whereupon I quite made my mind up to go\nbravely in for it, and recompense Polly for all her faith, and\ngratitude, and frugality, if she should prove herself capable of keeping\ncounsel also.\n\nTo this intent I expressed myself as elegantly as could be, having led\nPolly out to the wooden bridge, that nobody else might hear me. For that\nfine old woman became so deaf, all of a sudden, that I had no faith in\nany more of her organs, and desired to be at safe distance from her, as\nwell as to learn something more of the cows. Nor did I miss the chance;\nfor all of them having been milked by Polly, came up to know what I had\nto say to her, and their smell was beautiful. So I gave them a bit of\nsalt out of my pocket, such as I always carry when ashore, and offered\nthem some tobacco; and they put out their broad yellow lips for the one,\nand snorted and sneezed at the other. When these valuable cows were gone\nto have a little more grazing, I just made Polly aware of the chance\nthat appeared to be open before us. In short, I laid clearly before her\nthe whole of my recent grand discovery, proving distinctly that with\nnothing more than a little proper management, I possessed therein at\nleast an equivalent for her snug meadow homestead, and all the\nmilch-cows, and the trout-stream. Only she must not forget one thing,\nnamely, that the whole of this value would vanish, if a single word of\nthis story were breathed any further off than our own two selves, until\nthe time was ripe for it. Of course I had not been quite such a fool as\nto give Nanette the smallest inkling of any motive on my part beyond\nthat pure curiosity, with which she could so well sympathise. Also it\nhad been settled between Captain Bluett and myself, that a fortnight was\nto be allowed me for hunting up all the evidence, before he should cross\nthe Channel; unless I took it on myself to fetch him.\n\nPolly opened her blue eyes to such a size at all I told her, that I\nbecame quite uneasy lest she should open her mouth in proportion. For if\nmy discovery once took wind before its entire completion, there would be\nat least fifty jealous fellows thrusting their oars into my own\nrowlocks, and robbing me of my own private enterprise. Also Miss Polly\ngave way to a feeling of anger and indignation, which certainly might be\nto some extent natural, but was, to say the least of it, in a far\ngreater measure indiscreet, and even perilous.\n\n\"Oh the villain! oh the cruel villain!\" she exclaimed, in a voice that\nquite alarmed me, considering how near the footpath was; \"and a minister\nof the Gospel too! Oh the poor little babes, one adrift on the sea, and\nthe other among them naked savages! What a mercy as they didn't eat him!\nAnd to blame the whole of it on a nice, harmless, kind-spoken, handsome\ngentleman, like our Captain! Oh, let me get hold of him!\"\n\n\"That, my dear Polly, we never shall do, if you raise your voice in this\nway. Now come away from these trees with the ivy, and let us speak very\nquietly.\"\n\nThis dear creature did (as nearly as could be expected) what I told her;\nso that I really need not repent of my noble faith in the female race.\nThis encouraged me; from its tendency to abolish prejudice, and to let\nthe weaker vessels show that there is such a thing as a cork to them.\nMen are apt to judge too much by experience on this subject; when they\nought to know that experience never does apply to women, any more than\nreason does.\n\nNevertheless my Polly saw the way in and out of a lot of things, which\nto me were difficult. Especially as to the manner of handling her\ncousin, Mrs Shapland, a very good woman in her way, but a ticklish one\nto deal with. And all the credit for all the truth we get out of Mrs\nShapland belongs not to me (any more than herself), but goes down in a\nlump to poor Polly.\n\nTo pass this lightly--as now behoves me--just let me tell what Susan\nShapland said, when I worked it out of her. Any man can get the truth\nout of a woman, if he knows the way; I mean, of course, so far as she\nhas been able to receive it. To expect more than this is unreasonable;\nand to get that much is wonderful. However, Polly and I, between us, did\nget a good deal of it.\n\nOf course, we did not let this good woman even guess what we wanted with\nher; only we borrowed a farmer's cart from Bang, my old boy, who was now\nset up in a farm on his grandmother's ashes; and his horse was not to be\nfound fault with, if a man did his duty in lashing him. This I was ready\nto understand, when pointed out by Polly; and he never hoisted his tail\nbut what I raked him under his counter.\n\nSo after a long hill, commanding miles and miles of the course of the\nriver, we fetched up in the courtyard of Farmer Shapland, and found his\nwife a brisk sharp woman, quite ready to tell her story. But what she\ndid first, and for us, at this moment, was to rouse up the fire with a\ngreat dry fagot, crackling and sparkling merrily. For the mist of\nNovember was now beginning to crawl up the wavering valley, and the\nfading light from the west struck coldly on the winding river.\n\nIn such a case, and after a drive of many miles and much scenery, any\nman loves to see pots and pans goaded briskly to bubbling and\nsputtering, or even to help in the business himself, so far as the cook\nwill put up with it. And then if a foolish good woman allows him (as\npride sometimes induces her) to lift up a pot-lid when trembling with\nflavour, or give a shake to the frying-pan in the ecstasy of crackling,\nor even to blow on the iron spoon, and then draw in his breath with a\ndrop of it--what can he want with any scenery out of the window, or\noutside his waistcoat?\n\nSuch was my case, I declare to you, in that hospitable house with these\ngood people of Burrington; nor could we fall to any other business,\nuntil this was done with; then after dark we drew round the fire, with a\nblack-jack of grand old ale, and our pipes, to hear Mrs Shapland's\nstory.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIV.\n\nSUSAN QUITE ACQUITS HERSELF.\n\n\nIt really does seem as wise a plan as any I am acquainted with, to let\nthis good woman act according to the constitution of her sex,--that is\nto say, to say her say, and never be contradicted. We contradicted her\nonce or twice to reconcile her to herself; but all that came of it was\nto make her contradict perhaps herself, but certainly us, ten times as\nmuch. She did her best to explain her meaning; and we really ought to\nenter more into their disabilities. Therefore let her tell her story, as\nnearly in her own words, poor thing, as my sense of the English language\ncan in any style agree with.\n\n\"I was nurse at Narnton Court, ever so many years ago--when my name was\nSusan Moggeridge,--Charley, you cannot deny it, you know; and all of us\nmust be content to grow old, it is foolish to look at things otherwise.\nTwelve and six, that makes eighteen; now, Captain Wells, you know it do;\nand, Charley, can you say otherwise? Then it must have been eighteen\nyears agone, when I was took on for under-nurse, because the Princess\nwas expecting, the same as the butler told me. And it came to pass on a\nSunday night, with two miles away from the doctor. Orders had been\ngiven; but they foreigners always do belie them. Too soon always, or too\nlate; and these two little dears was too soon, by reason of the\nwonderful child the eldest one was prepared for. A maid she was, and the\nother a boy; two real beauties both of them; as fair as could be, with\nlittle clear dots under their skin, in corner places, because of their\nmother the Princess. But nothing as any one would observe, except for a\nbeauty to both of them. The boy was the biggest, though the girl came\nfirst; and first was her nature in everything, except, of course, in\nfatness, and by reason of always dancing. Not six months old was that\nchild before she could dance on the kitchen table with only one hand to\nhold her up, and a pleasure it was to look at her. And laugh with her\nlittle funny face, and nod her head, she would, as if she saw to the\nbottom of everything. And when she were scarce turned the twelvemonth,\nshe could run, like--oh, just like anything, and roll over and over on\nthe grass with her 'Pomyolianian dog,' as she called him, and there\nwasn't a word in the language as ever come amiss to her, but for the r's\nor the y's in it. Words such as I could lay no tongue to, she would take\nand pronounce right off, and then laugh at herself and everybody. And\nthe way she used to put her hands out, laying down the law to all of\nus--we didn't want a showman in the house so long as we had Miss Bertha,\nor 'Bardie,' as she called herself, though christened after her mother.\nEverybody, the poor little mite, she expected everybody to know her name\nand all about her; and nothing put her in such a passion as to pretend\nnot to know who she was. 'I'se Bardie,' she used to cry out, with her\nlittle hands spread, and her bright eyes flashing; 'I'se Bardie, I tell\n'a; and evelybody knows it.' Oh yes, and she never could say 'th'--but\n'niss' and 'nat,' for this and that. And how angry she used to be, to be\nsure, if anybody mocked her, as we used to do for the fun of it. But\neven there, she was up to us, for she began to talk French, for revenge\nupon us, having taken the trick from her mother.\n\n\"Likewise the boy was a different child altogether in many ways. He\nscarcely could learn to speak at all, because he was a very fine child\nindeed, and quiet, and fat, and easy. He would lie by for hours on a\nvelvet cushion, and watch his little sister having her perpetual round\nof play. Dolls, and horses, and Noah's arks, and all the things that\nwere alive to her, and she talking to them whiles the hour,--he took no\nmore notice than just to stroke them, and say, 'Boo, boo!' or 'Poor,\npoor!' which was nearly all that he could say. Not that he was to blame,\nof course, nor would any one having sense think of it, especially after\nhe took the pink fever, and it struck to his head, and they cut his hair\noff. Beautiful curls as was ever seen, and some of them in my drawer\nup-stairs now, with the colour of gold streaking over them. Philip his\nname was, of course, from Sir Philip, and being the heir to the title;\nbut his clever sister she always called him 'little brother,' as if he\nwas just born almost, when he weighed pretty nearly two of her.\n\n\"Sir Philip, the good old gentleman, was away in foreign parts, they\nsaid, or commanding some of the colonies, up to the time when these two\ntwins were close upon two years old, or so. I remember quite well when\nhe came home with his luggage marked 'General Bampfylde;' and we said it\nwas disrespectful of the Government to call him so, when his true name\nwas 'Sir Philip.' He had never seen his grandchildren till now, and what\na fuss he made with them! But they had scarcely time to know him before\nthey were sadly murdered; or worse, perhaps, for all that any one knows\nto the contrary. Because Sir Philip's younger son, Captain Drake\nBampfylde, came from the seas and America, just at this time. No one\nexpected him, of course, from among such distant places; and he had not\nbeen home for three years at least, and how noble he did look, until we\nsaw how his shirts were cobbled! And every one all about the place said\nthat his little finger was worth the whole of the Squire's body. Because\nthe Squire, his elder brother, and the heir of Sir Philip, was of a\nnature, not to say--but I cannot make it clear to you. No one could say\na word against him; only he were not, what you may call it,--not as we\nDevonshire people are,--not with a smile and kind look of the eye, the\nsame as Captain Drake was.\n\n\"This poor Captain Drake--poor or bad, I scarce know which to put it,\nafter all I have heard of him--anyhow his mind was set upon a little\nchit of a thing, not more than fifteen at this time. Her name was Isabel\nCarey, and her father had been a nobleman, and when he departed this\nlife he ordered her off to Narnton Court. So she did at an early age;\nand being so beautiful as some thought, she was desperate with the\nCaptain. They used to go walking all up in the woods, or down on the\nriver in a boat, until it was too bad of them. The Captain, I daresay,\nmeant no harm, and perhaps he did none; but still there are sure to be\ntalkative people who want to give their opinions. If Charley had carried\non so with me, whatever should I have thought of myself?\n\n\"Well, there was everybody saying very fine things to everybody, gay\ndoings likewise, and great feasts, and singing, and dancing, and all the\nrest. And the Captain hired a pleasure-boat, by name the 'Wild Duck of\nAppledore;' and I never shall forget the day when he took a whole pack\nof us for a sail out over Barnstaple bar and back. I was forced to go,\nbecause he needs must take the children; and several even old people\nwere sick, but no one a quarter so bad as me. And it came into my mind\nin that state, that he was longing, as well as welcome, to cast us all\ninto the raging sea. However, the Lord preserved us. This little ship\nhad one mast, as they call it, and he kept her generally in a little\nbend just above the salmon-weir, so as to see the men draw the pool, and\nhimself to shoot the wild-fowl, from a covered place there is; and by\nreason of being so long at sea, he could not sleep comfortable at the\nCourt, but must needs make his bed in this pleasuring-ship, and to it he\nused to go to and fro in a little white boat as belonged to it.\n\n\"All this time the weather was so hot we could scarcely bear our clothes\non, and were ready to envy them scandalous savages belonging to the\nfamous Parson Chowne, who went about with no clothes on. There was one\nof these known to be down on the burrows a-bathing of his wife and\nfamily, if a decent woman may name them so. Well, the whole of these gay\ngoings on, to celebrate the return of Sir Philip, and of Captain Drake,\nand all that they owed to the Lord for His goodness, was to finish up\nwith a great dinner to all the tenants on the property; and then on the\nchildren's birthday, a feasting of all the gentry around; and a dance\nwith all sorts of outlandish dresses and masks on, in the evening. For\nthe fashion of this was come down from London, and there had been a\nparty of this sort over to Lord Bassett's; and the neighbourhood was\nwild with it. And after this everything was to be quiet, because my Lady\nthe Princess Bertha was again beginning to expect almost.\n\n\"And now, Captain Wells, you would hardly believe what a blow there was\nsent, by the will of the Lord, upon all of this riot and revelry. There\nwas many of us having pious disposals, as well as religious\nbringings-up, whose stomachs really was turned by the worldliness as was\naround us. Young ladies of the very best families, instead of turning\ntheir minds to the Lord, turning of themselves about, with young men\nlaying hold of them, as if there was nothing more to be said than 'Kiss\nme quick!' and, 'I'll do it again!' But there was a judgment coming.\nThey might lay the blame on me, if they like. There is folk as knows\nbetter.\n\n\"That very night it was so hot, with the sun coming up from the river,\nthat even the great hall the dance was to be in, was only fit to lie\ndown in. So that Captain Drake, in his man-of-war voice, shouted (and I\nthink I can hear him now), 'Ladies and gentlemen, I propose that we have\nour dance out on the terrace.' This was the open made-up flat between\nthe house and the river, and the Captain's offer was caught up at,\ndirectly the gentlefolk seen the moon.\n\n\"Here they were going on ever so long; and the more of twirling round\nthey had, and of making heel and toe, and crossing arms and even\nfrontesses, the more they seemed to like it; also the music up and down\nalmost as bad as they was; so that what with the harlequin dresses, and\nmasquerading, and mummeries, scarcely any one could have the head to be\nsure of any one else almost. I could not help looking at them, although\nmy place was to heed the children only, and keep them out of mischief,\nand take them to bed at the proper time. But Captain Drake, who was\nhere, there, and elsewhere, making himself agreeable, up he comes to me\nwith a bottle, and he says, 'Mary, have some.' 'My name is not Mary, but\nSusan, sir, and much at your service,' I answered; so that he poured me\na great glassful, and said that it was Sam--something. I was not so rude\nas to give him denial, but made him a curtsy, and drank it, for it was\nnot so strong as my father's cider; no, nor so good to my liking. And\nfor any to say that it got in my head, shows a very spiteful woman. The\nCaptain went on to the other maids, as were looking on for the life of\nthem, all being out-of-doors, you must mind, and longing to have their\nturn at it. But I held myself above them always, and went back to my\nchildren.\n\n\"These were in a little bower made up for the occasion, with boughs of\ntrees, and twisted wood, and moss from the forest to lie upon. Master\nPhilip was tired and heavy, and working his eyes with the backs of his\nhands, and yawning, and falling away almost. But that little Bertha was\nas wide-awake as a lark on her nest in the morning. Everywhere she was\nlooking about for somebody to encourage her to have 'more play,' as she\nalways called for; and 'more play' continually. That child was so full\nof life, it was 'more play' all day long with her! And even now, in the\nfiery heat and thorough down thirst of the weather, nothing was further\nfrom her mind than to go to bed without a gambol for it. She had nothing\non but her little shift, or under-frock I should call it, made by\nmyself, when the hot weather came, from a new jemmyset of the Princess,\nand cut out by my lady to fit her for the sake of the coolness. Her\ngrand white upper frock, trimmed with lace, had been taken off by her\npapa, I believe, when the visitors would have her dance on the table,\nand make speeches to them; the poor little soul was so quick and so hot.\n\n\"Well, I do declare to you, Captain Wells, and Charley, Polly likewise,\nwhich will believe me, though the men may not, it was not more than a\nminute or so much, perhaps I should say not half a minute, as I happened\nto turn round to pass a compliment with a young man as seemed struck\nwith me the Sunday before in church-time; a sailor he were, and had come\nwith the Captain, and was his mate of the pleasure-boat. A right down\nhandsome young man he was--no call for you to be jealous, Charley.\nBeneath the salt waves he do lie. Well, I turned back my head in about\nfive seconds, and both of the babes was gone out of my sight! At first I\nwere not frightened much. I took it for one of Miss Bertha's tricks, to\nmake off with her little brother. So strong she was on her legs, though\nlight, that many a time she would lift him up by his middle and carry\nhim half round the room, and then both of them break out laughing. 'I'll\nwhip you, you see if I don't,' I cried, as I ran round the corner to\nseek for them; though whip them I never did, poor dears, any more than\ntheir own mother did. I ran all about, for five minutes at least, around\nand among the branches stuck in to make the bower, and every moment I\nmade up my mind for Miss Bardie to pop out on me. But pop out she never\ndid, nor will, until the day of judgment.\n\n\"When I began to see something more than an innocent baby trick in it,\nand to think (I daresay) of these two babies' value, with all the land\nthey were born to, the first thing I did was to call out 'Jack!' such\nbeing all sailors' names, of course. But Jack was gone out of all\nhearing; and most folk said it was Jack that took them! To the contrary\nI could swear; but who would listen to me when the lie went out that I\nwas quite tipsy?\n\n\"Of the rest I cannot speak clearly, because my heart flew right up into\nmy brain, directly moment the people came round shouting at me for the\nchildren. And of these the very worst was Parson Chowne. If it had been\nhis own only children--such as he says he is too good to have--he\nscarcely could have been more rampagious, not to use worse words of him.\nThe first thing that every one ran to, of course, was the parapetch and\nthe river, and a great cry was made for Captain Drake Bampfylde, from\nhis knowledge of the waterways. But, though all the evening foremost in\nconducting everything, now there was no sign to be had of him, or of who\nhad seen him last. And it must have been an hour ere ever he come, and\nthen of course it was too late.\n\n\"I was so beside myself all that night that I cannot tell how the time\nwent by. I remember looking over the parapetch at a place where the\nwater is always deep, and seeing the fishermen from the salmon-weir\ndragging their nets for the poor mites of bodies. And my blood seemed to\ncurdle inside me almost, every time they came out with a stone or a log.\nNothing was found from that night to this day, and nothing will ever be\nfound of it. I was discharged, and a great many others; not the first\ntime in this world, I believe, when the bottom of the whole was\nwitchcraft. Here, Charley, put something hot in my glass; the evenings\nare getting so dark; and I never can see the moon and the water, like\nthat, and the trees, without remembering. Now ask me no more, if you\nplease, good people.\"\n\nWhen Mrs Shapland had finished this tale, and was taking some\nwell-earned refreshment, Polly and I looked at one another, as much as\nto say, \"That settles it.\" Nor did we press her with any more questions\nuntil her mind had recovered its tone by frying some slices of ham cut\nthin, and half-a-dozen new-laid eggs for us. Then, I approached her with\nno small praise, which she deserved, and appeared (so far as I could\njudge) to desire, perhaps; and with a little skill on my part, she was\nsoon warmed up again, having tasted egg-flip, to be sure of it.\n\n\"Yes, Captain Wells, you can see through the whole of it. Sailors can\nunderstand a river, when nobody else knows anything. The Captain came\nforward as soon as he could, and he says, 'You fools, what are you\nabout? An hour ago the tide was running five knots an hour where you be\ndragging! If the poor children fell over, they must be down river-bar by\nthis time.' And off he set out on a galloping horse, to scurry the\nsandhills somehow. And scurry was now the whole of it. Sir Philip came\nforth, and that poor Squire Philip; and a thousand pounds was as freely\ntalked of as if it was halfpence. And every one was to be put in prison;\nespecially me, if you please, as blameless as the unborn babe was! And\nthat very night the Princess were taken, and died the next day,\nupsetting everything, ever so much worse than ever. For poor Squire\nPhilip fell into a trance, so to say, out of sheer vexation. He cried\nout that the hand of the Lord was upon him, and too heavy for him to\nbear--particular from his own brother. And after that not an inch would\nhe budge to make inquiry or anything, but shut himself up in his dead\nwife's rooms, and there he have moped from that day to this, in a living\ngrave, as you may call it.\"\n\nIn reply to my question what reasons the Squire, or any one else, might\nhave for charging the Captain with so vile a deed, this excellent woman\nset them forth pretty much to the following purport. First, it was the\nCaptain himself who proposed the dancing on the terrace. Second, it was\nhis own man who drew her attention away from the children, after a\ngoblet of wine had been administered by the master. Third, it was his\nown boat which was missing, and never heard of afterwards. Fourth, the\nCaptain himself disappeared from the party at the very time that the\nchildren were stolen, and refused to say whither, or why, he was gone.\nThat active and shrewd man Parson Chowne no sooner heard of the loss\nthan he raised a cry for the Captain all over the terrace, to come and\ncommand the fishermen; and though as a friend of the family Chowne would\nnever express an opinion, he could not undo that sad shake of the head\nwhich he gave when no Captain could be found. Fifth, a man with a\nCaptain's hat was seen burying two small bodies that night, in the depth\nof Braunton Wilderness; though nothing was heard of it till the next\nweek, through the savageness of the witness; and by that time the fierce\nstorm on the Sunday had changed the whole face of the burrows, so that\nto find the spot was impossible. Sixth, it was now recalled to mind that\nDrake Bampfylde had killed a poor schoolfellow in his young days, for\nwhich the Lord had most righteously sent a shark in pursuit of him. It\nwas likely enough that he would go on killing children upon occasion.\nSeventh reason, and perhaps worth all the rest--only think what a motive\nhe had for it. No one else could gain sixpence by it; Drake Bampfylde\nwould gain everything--the succession to the title and estates, and the\nimmediate right to aspire to the hand of the beautiful heiress, Miss\nCarey, who was known to favour him.\n\nAn elderly woman, who had been in the workhouse, and throve upon that\nexperience, said that the Captain would never have done it; for he might\nhave to do the like thing again, every time the poor Princess should\nhappen to be confined almost. But who could listen to this poor\ncreature, while the result lay there before them?\n\nThus the common people reasoned; but our Susan attached no weight to any\nexcept the last argument. As for one, she knew quite well that the young\nseaman sauntered there quite by chance, and quite by chance she spoke to\nhim: and as for wine, she could take a quart of her father's cider, and\nfeel it less than she could describe to any one; and as for a rummer of\nthat stuff she had, it was quite below contempt to her. And concerning\nthe Captain just being away, and declining to say where he was, like a\ngentleman; none but ignorant folk could pretend not to know what that\nmeant. Of course he was gone, between the dances, for a little cool walk\nin the firwoods, together with his Isabel; and to expose her name to the\npublic, with their nasty way of regarding things, was utterly out of the\nquestion to a real British officer! And to finish it, Mrs Shapland said\nthat she was almost what you might call a young woman even now; at any\nrate with ten times the sense any of the young ones were up to. And ten\nyears of her life she would give, if Charley would allow of her, to know\nwhat became of them two little dears, and to punish the villain that\nwronged them.\n\nHereupon my warmth of heart got the better of my prudence. My wise and\npure intention was to get out of this good woman all I could; but impart\nto her nothing more than was needful, just to keep her talking.\nExperience shows us that this need be very little indeed, if anything,\nin a female dialogue. But now I was brought to such a pitch of\ntenderness by this time, with my heart in a rapid pulse of descriptions,\nand the egg-flip going round sturdily, also Polly looking at me in a\nmost beseeching way, that I could not keep my own counsel even, but was\ncompelled to increase their comfort by declaring every thing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXV.\n\nSO DOES POOR OLD DAVY.\n\n\nHereupon, you may well suppose that the grass must no longer grow under\nmy feet. With one man, and positively two women, in this very same\ncounty, having possession of my secret, how long could I hope to work\nthis latter to any good purpose? Luckily Burrington lay at a very great\ndistance from Nympton on the Moors, and with no road from one to the\nother; so that if Mr and Mrs Shapland should fail of keeping their\npromised tightness, at least two Barnstaple market-days must pass before\nNympton heard anything. And but for this consideration, even their style\nof treatment would not have made me so confiding.\n\nOn the following morn, while looking forth at pigs, and calves, and\ncocks, and ducks, I perceived that the crash must come speedily, and\nresolved to be downright smart with it. So after making a brisk little\nbreakfast, upon the two wings and two legs of a goose, grilled with a\ntrifle of stuffing, there was but one question I asked before leaving\nmany warm tears behind me.\n\n\"Good Mistress Shapland, would you know that jemmyset of the child, if\nyou saw it?\"\n\n\"Captain Wells, I am not quite a natural. My own stitching done with a\nclub-head, all of it, and of a three-lined thread as my uncle's, and\nnobody else had, to Barnstaple. Likewise the mark of the Princess done,\na mannygram, as they call it.\"\n\nThe weather was dull, and the time of year as stormy as any I know of:\nnevertheless it was quite fine now, and taking upon myself to risk five\nguineas out of my savings, Ilfracombe was the place I sought, and found\nit with some difficulty. Thus might Barnstaple bar be avoided, and all\nthe tumbling of inshore waters; and thus with no more than a pilot-yawl\ndid I cross that dangerous channel, at the most dangerous time of the\nyear almost. Nothing less than my Royal clothes and manifest high rank\nin the Navy could have induced this fine old pilot to make sail for the\nopposite coast in the month of November, when violent gales are so\ncommon with us. But I showed him two alternatives, three golden guineas\non the one hand, impressment on the other; for a press-gang was in the\nneighbourhood now, and I told him that I was its captain, and that we\nlaughed at all certificates. And not being sure that this man and his\nson might not combine to throw me overboard, steal my money, and run\nback to port, I took care to let them perceive my entry of their names\nand my own as well in the register of the coast-guard. However they\nproved very honest fellows, and we anchored under Porthcawl point soon\nafter dark that evening.\n\nHaving proved to the pilot that he was quite safe here, unless it should\ncome on to blow from south-east, of which there was no symptom, and\nleaving him under the care of Sandy, who at my expense stood treat to\nhim, I made off for Candleston, not even stopping for a chat with Roger\nBerkrolles. The Colonel, of course, as well as his sister Lady Bluett,\nand Rodney, wore delighted with what I had to tell them, while the maid\nherself listened with her face concealed to the tale of her own\nmisfortune. Once or twice she whispered to herself, \"Oh my poor poor\nfather!\" and when I had ended she rose from the sofa where Lady Bluett's\narm was around her, and went to the Colonel and said, \"How soon will you\ntake me to my father!\"\n\n\"My darling Bertha,\" said the Colonel, embracing her, as if she had been\nhis daughter, \"we will start to-morrow, if Llewellyn thinks the weather\nquite settled, and the boat quite safe. He knows so much about boats,\nyou see. It would take us a week to go round by land. But we won't start\nat all, if you cry, my dear!\"\n\nI did not altogether like the tone of the Colonel's allusion to me;\nstill less was I pleased when he interrupted Lady Bluett's\ncongratulations, thanks, and fervent praises of my skill, perseverance,\nand trustiness in discovering all this villany.\n\n\"Humph!\" said the Colonel; \"I am not quite sure that this villany would\nhave succeeded so long, unless a certain small boat had proved so\nadapted for fishing purposes.\"\n\n\"Why, Henry!\" cried his sister; \"how very unlike you! What an unworthy\ninsinuation! After all Mr Llewellyn has done; it is positively\nungrateful. And he spoke of that boat in this very room, as I can\nperfectly well remember, not--oh not--I am sure any more than a very few\nyears ago, my dear.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said the Colonel; \"too few years ago. If he had spoken of\nthat at the time, as distinctly as he did afterwards, when the heat of\ninquiry was over, and when Sir Philip himself had abandoned it, I do\nnot see how all this confusion, between the loss of a foreign ship and\nthe casting away of a British boat, could have arisen, or at any rate\ncould have failed to be cleared away. Llewellyn, you know that I do not\njudge hastily. Sir, I condemn your conduct.\"\n\n\"Oh, Colonel, how dreadful of you! Mr Llewellyn, go and look at the\nweather, while I prove to the Colonel his great mistake. You did speak\nof the boat at the very inquest, in the most noble and positive manner;\nand nobody would believe you, as you your very self told me. What more\ncould any man do? We are none of us safe, if we do our very best, and\nhave it turned against us.\"\n\nMy conscience all this time was beating, so that I could hear it. This\nis a gift very good men have, and I have made a point of never failing\nto cultivate it. In this trying moment, with even a man so kind and\nblameless suddenly possessed, no doubt, by an evil spirit against me,\nstanch as rock my conscience stood, and to my support it rose,\ncreditably for both of us.\n\n\"Colonel Lougher,\" my answer was, \"you will regret this attack on the\nhonour of a British officer. One, moreover, whose great-grandfather\nharped in your Honour's family. Captain Bluett understands the build of\na boat as well as I do. He shall look at that boat to-morrow morning,\nand if he declares her to be English-built, you may set me down, with\nall my stripes and medals, for a rogue, sir. But if he confirms my\nsurety of her being a foreigner, nothing but difference of rank will\nexcuse you, Colonel Lougher, from being responsible to me.\"\n\nMy spirit was up, as you may see; and the honour of the British Navy\nforced me to speak strongly: although my affection for the man was such\nthat sooner than offend him, I would have my other arm shot away.\n\n\"Llewellyn,\" said the Colonel, with his fine old smile spreading very\npleasantly upon his noble countenance; \"you are of the peppery order\nwhich your old Welsh blood produces. Think no more of my words for the\npresent. And if my nephew agrees with you in pronouncing the boat a\nforeigner, I will give you full satisfaction by asking your pardon,\nLlewellyn. It was enough to mislead any man.\"\n\nNot to dwell upon this mistake committed by so good a man, but which got\nabroad somehow--though my old friend Crumpy, I am sure, could never have\nbeen listening at the door--be it enough in this hurry to say, that on\nthe next morning I was enabled to certify the weather. A smartish\nbreeze from the north-north-west, with the sea rather dancing than\nrunning, took poor Bardie to her native coast, from which the hot tide\nhad borne her. Before we set sail, I had been to Sker in Colonel\nLougher's two-wheeled gig, and obtained from good Moxy the child's\njemmyset from the old oak chest it was stored in.\n\nAnd now I did a thing which must for ever acquit me of all blame so\nwrongfully cast upon me. That is to say, I fetched out the old boat,\nwhich Sandy Macraw had got covered up; and releasing him in the most\ngenerous manner from years and years of backrent, what did I do but\nhitch her on to the stern of the pilot-yawl, for to tow? Not only this,\nbut I managed that Rodney should sail on board as her skipper, and for\nhis crew should have somebody who had crossed the channel before in that\nsame poor and worthless boat, sixteen years agone, I do declare! And\nthey did carry on a bit, now and then, when our sprit-sail hid them from\nour view. For the day was bright, and the sea was smooth.\n\nThe Colonel and I were on board of the yawl, enjoying perfect harmony.\nFor Captain Rodney of course had confirmed my opinion as to the build of\nthe boat, and his uncle desired to beg my pardon, which the largeness of\nmy nature quite refused to hear of. If a man admits that he has wronged\nme, satisfied I am at once, and do not even point out always, that I\nnever could have done the like to him.\n\nColonel Lougher had often been at sea, in the time of his active\nservice, and he seemed to enjoy this trip across channel, and knew all\nthe names of the sails and spars. But falling in as we did with no less\nthan three or four small craft on our voyage, he asked me how Delushy's\nboat could possibly have been adrift for a whole night and day on the\nchannel, without any ship even sighting her. I told him that this was as\nsimple as could be, during that state of the weather. A burning haze, or\nsteam from the land, lay all that time on the water; and the lower part\nthereof was white, while the upper spread was yellow. Also the sea\nitself was white from the long-continued calmness, so that a white boat\nscarcely would show at half a mile of distance. And even if it did, what\nsailors were likely to keep a smart look-out in such roasting weather?\nMen talk of the heat ashore sometimes; but I know that for downright\nsmiting, blinding, and overwhelming sun-power, there is nothing ashore\nto compare with a ship.\n\nAlso I told the Colonel, now that his faith in me was re-established,\ngliding over the water thus, I was enabled to make plain to him things\nwhich if he had been ashore might have lain perhaps a little beyond his\nunderstanding. I showed him the set of the tides by tossing corks from\nhis bottles overboard, and begging him to take a glass of my perspective\nto watch them. And he took such interest in this, and evinced so much\nsagacity, that in order to carry on my reasoning with any perspicacity,\ncork after cork I was forced to draw, to establish my veracity.\n\nBecause he would argue it out that a boat, unmanned and even unmasted,\nnever could have crossed the channel as Bardie's boat must needs have\ndone. I answered that I might have thought so also, and had done so for\nyears and years, till there came the fact to the contrary; of which I\nwas pretty well satisfied now; and when the boat was produced and sworn\nto, who would not be satisfied? Also I begged to remind him how strongly\nthe tide ran in our channel, and that even in common weather the ebb of\nthe spring out of Barnstaple river might safely be put at four knots an\nhour, till Hartland point was doubled. Here, about two in the morning,\nthe flood would catch the little wanderer, and run her up channel some\nten or twelve miles, with the night-wind on the starboard-beam driving\nher also northward. When this was exhausted, the ebb would take her into\nSwansea Bay almost, being so light a boat as she was, with a southern\nbreeze prevailing. And then the next flood might well bring her to\nSker,--exactly the thing that had come to pass. Moreover I thought, as I\ntold the Colonel (although of course with diffidence), from long\nacquaintance with tropical waters and the power of the sun upon them, I\nthought it by no means unlikely that the intense heat of the weather,\nthen for more than six weeks prevailing, might have had some strong\neffect on the set and the speed of the currents.\n\nHowever, no more of arguments. What good can they do, when the thing is\nthere, and no reasoning can alter it? Even Parson Chowne might argue,\nand no doubt would with himself (although too proud with other people),\nthat all he did was right, and himself as good a man as need be.\n\nWe ran across channel in some six hours, having a nice breeze abaft the\nbeam, and about the middle of the afternoon we landed at Ilfracombe\ncleverly. This is a little place lying in a hole, and with great rocks\nall around it, fair enough to look at, but more easy to fall down than\nto get up them. And even the Barnstaple road is so steep that the first\nhill takes nearly two hours of climbing. Therefore, in spite of all\neager spirits, we found ourselves forced to stay there that night, for\nno one would horse us onwards, so late at this November season.\n\nPerhaps, however, it was worth while to lose a few hours for the sake of\nseeing Delushy's joy in her native land. This, like a newly-opened\nspring, arose, and could not contain itself. As soon as her foot touched\nthe shore, I began to look forward to a bout of it. For I understand\nyoung women now, very well, though the middle-aged are beyond me. These\nlatter I hope to be up to, if ever I live to the age of fourscore years,\nas my constitution promises. And if the Lord should be pleased to\npromote me to the ripe and honest century (as was done to my\ngreat-grandfather), then I shall understand old women also, though\nperhaps without teeth to express it.\n\nHowever this was a pretty thing, and it touched me very softly. None but\nthose who have roamed as I have understand the heart-ache. For my native\nland I had it, ever and continually, and in the roar of battle I was\nborne up by discharging it. And so I could enter into our poor Bardie,\ngoing about with the tears in her eyes. For she would not allow me to\nrest at the inn, as I was fain to do in the society of some ancient\nfishermen, and to leave the gentlefolk to their own manner of getting\nthrough the evening.\n\n\"Come out,\" she cried, \"old Davy; you are the only one that knows the\nway about this lovely place.\"\n\nOf course I had no choice but to obey Sir Philip's own granddaughter,\nalthough I could not help grumbling; and thus we began to explore a lane\nas crooked as a corkscrew, and with ferns like palm-trees feathering. In\namong them little trickling rills of water tinkled, or were hushed\nsometimes by moss, and it looked as if no frost could enter through the\nleafy screen above.\n\n\"What a country to be born in! What a country to belong to!\" exclaimed\nthe maid continually, sipping from each crystal runnel, and stroking the\nferns with reverence. \"Uncle Henry, don't you think now that it is\nenough to make one happy to belong to such a land?\"\n\n\"Well, my dear,\" said her Uncle Henry, as she had been ordered to call\nthe Colonel, \"I think it would still more conduce to happiness for some\nof the land to belong to you. Ah, Llewellyn, I see, is of my opinion.\"\n\nSo I was, and still more so next day, when, having surmounted that\nterrible hill, we travelled down rich dairy valleys on our road to\nBarnstaple. Here we halted for refreshment, and to let Delushy rest and\nbeautify herself, although we could see no need of that. And now she\nbegan to get so frightened that I was quite vexed with her: her first\nduty was to do me credit; and how could she manage it, if her eyes were\nred? The Colonel also began to provoke me, for when I wanted to give the\nmaid a stiff glass of grog to steady her, he had no more sense than to\ncountermand it, and order a glass of cold water!\n\nAs soon as we came to Narnton Court, we found a very smart coach in the\nyard, that quite put to shame our hired chaise, although the good\nColonel had taken four horses, so as to land us in moderate style. Of\ncourse it was proper that I, who alone could claim Sir Philip's\nacquaintance, as well as the merit of the whole affair, should have the\npleasure of introducing his new grandchild to him; so that I begged all\nthe rest to withdraw, and the only names that we sent in, were Captain\nLlewellyn and \"Miss Delushy.\" Therefore we were wrong, no doubt, in\nfeeling first a little grievance, then a large-minded impatience, and\nfinally a strong desire--ay, and not the desire alone--to swear, before\nwe got out of it. I speak of myself and Captain Bluett, two good honest\nsailors, accustomed to declare their meaning since the war enabled them.\nBut Colonel Lougher (who might be said, from his want of active service,\nto belong to a past generation), as well as Delushy, who was scarcely\ncome into any generation yet,--these two really set an example, good,\nthough hard, to follow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVI\n\nTHE MAID AT LAST IS \"DENTIFIED.\"\n\n\nHowever, as too often happens, we blamed a good man without cause. A\ngood man rarely deserves much blame; whereas a bad man cannot have too\nmuch--whether he has earned it or otherwise--to restrain him from\ndeserving more. The reason why Sir Philip Bampfylde kept us so long\nwaiting, proved to be a sound and valid one; namely, that he was engaged\nin earnest and important converse with his daughter-in-law, Lady\nBampfylde, now wife (if you will please to remember) to Commodore Sir\nDrake Bampfylde, although by birth entitled the Honourable Isabel\nCarey, the one that had been so good to me when I was a ferryman; of\nsuperior order, certainly; but still, no more than a ferryman!\n\nSince my rise in the world began, I have found out one satisfactory\nthing--that a man gets on by merit. How long did I despair of this, and\nsmoke pipes, and think over it; seeing many of my friends advancing, by\nwhat I call roguery! And but for the war (which proves the hearts and\nreins of men, as my ancestor says), I might still have been high and\ndry, being too honest for the fish-trade. However, true merit will tell\nin the end, if a man contrives to live long enough.\n\nSo when the beautiful lady came out through the room where I sate\nwaiting, as I touched my venerable forelock to her (as humbly as if for\na sixpenny piece), a brave man's honest pride wrought weakness in my\neyes, as I gazed at her. I loved her husband; and I loved her; and I\nthought of the bitter luck between them, which had kept them separate.\nPartly, of course, the glory of England, and duty of a proud man's\nbirth; partly also bad luck of course, and a style of giving in to it;\nbut ten times more than these, the tricks that lower our\nfellow-creatures.\n\nThis noble and stately lady did not at first sight recognise me; but\nwhen I had told her in very few words who I was, and what I had done,\nand how long I had sailed with her husband, and how highly he respected\nme, her eyes brightened into the old sweet smile, although they bore\ntraces of weeping.\n\n\"My name is not 'Lady Carey,'\" she said, for I was calling her thus on\npurpose, not knowing how she was taking wedlock, and being of opinion\nthat an \"honourable miss\" ought always to be called a lady. \"My name is\n'Lady Bampfylde;' and I like it, if you please: although I remember, Mr\nLlewellyn, what your views are of matrimony. You used to declare them\nonly too plainly, whenever we crossed your ferry, for the purpose, as I\nused to think, of driving poor Nanette to despair of you.\"\n\n\"And a lucky thing for me, your ladyship, to have acted so consistently.\nBut his Honour the Commodore, of course, holds the opposite opinion.\"\n\n\"It is hard to guess the opinions of a commodore always on service. Sir\nDrake, as I daresay you have heard, can scarcely bear to come home now.\"\n\nI saw that she was vexed by something, and also vexed with herself,\nperhaps, for having even hinted it. For she turned her beautiful face\naway, and without a word would have left me. But with my usual\nquickness of step, I ran into the lobby-place, and back in a moment with\nour Delushy, clinging like a woodbine to a post. At such moments, I\nnever speak, until women begin with questions. It saves so much time to\nlet them begin; because they are sure to insist on it. Meanwhile Delushy\nwas making the prettiest curtsy that presence of mind permitted.\n\n\"You lovely dear, why, who are you?\" cried Lady Bampfylde, with a start,\nthat made me dread hysterics.\n\n\"I do not know, Madam,\" answered Delushy, with the whole of her mind so\nwell in hand, by reason of years of suffering; \"but many people believe\nme to be the Bertha Bampfylde that was lost, nearly twenty years agone.\"\n\n\"What! The baby! The baby--at least one of the babies--that my\nhusband--David Llewellyn, this is very cruel of you.\"\n\nAnd that was all the thanks I got! While, what could I have done\notherwise? In five minutes more, she would have been off in her grand\ncoach with six horses, after offending Sir Philip so much, that he could\nnot have borne to look after her; although, of course, he was now coming\nout like a gentleman to a visitor. Seeing such a pay-night coming, and a\nlarge confusion, I begged Colonel Lougher and Captain Bluett to keep for\na little while out of it. And nothing could more truly prove how\nthoroughly these were gentlemen, than that they withdrew to a niche of\nthe under-butler's pantry, wherein they could hear no word of it.\n\nIt was now my place to stand forward bravely, and to put things clearly;\nwithout any further loss of reason, and even without considering how\nthese delicate ladies might contrive to take my meaning nicely. To spare\ngood ladies from any emotion, is one of the main things of my life;\nalthough they show such a want of gratitude, when I have done my utmost.\n\nBut as for frightening Sir Philip, of course, I had no scruple about\nthat; because of his confidence in the Lord. Therefore, abandoning Lady\nBampfylde to the care of her maid, who was running up from the servants'\nhall to look after her, I fixed my hook (screwed on for the purpose)\nfirmly into Delushy's sleeve, that she might not faint, or run away, or\ndo anything else unreasonable, and I led her up the long hall to meet\nSir Philip, as he came down the steps at the upper end thereof.\n\nThe old General looked rather haggard and feeble, as if the power of his\nlife were lowered by perpetual patience. But something had happened to\nvex him, no doubt, in his interview with Lady Bampfylde, so that he\nwalked with more than his usual stateliness and dignity. He had never\nbeheld me as a one-armed man, nor yet in my present uniform, for I took\nparticular care to avoid him during the day or two spent at his house\nbefore I went to Burrington, so for a moment he did not know me, but\ngazed with surprise at the lovely figure which I was sustaining so\nclumsily.\n\n\"Sir Philip Bampfylde, allow me,\" I said, stretching forth my right hand\nto him, \"to repay you for some of the countless benefits you have heaped\nupon me, by presenting you with your long-lost granddaughter--and your\ngrandson to come afterwards.\"\n\n\"It cannot be; it cannot be,\" was all he could say, although for so many\nyears he had shown his faith that it must be. His fine old countenance\nturned as white as the silver hair that crowned it, and then as red as\nit could have been in the hopeful blush of boyhood. And the pure and\nperfect delicacy of high birth quickened with sorrow prevented him from\nexamining Delushy, as he longed to do.\n\n\"Speak up, child, speak up,\" said I, giving her a haul with my hook, as\nwhen first I landed her; \"can't you tell your dear Grandfather how glad\nyou are to see him?\"\n\n\"That I will with all my heart,\" the maiden answered bashfully, yet\nlifting her eyes to the old man's face with pride as well as reverence;\n\"as soon as I perceive that you, sir, wish to hear me say it.\"\n\n\"You will not think me rude--I am scarcely strong enough for this--it\nhas come on me so suddenly. And it must be quite as bad for you. Lead\nthe young lady to a chair, Llewellyn. Or, stay; I beg your pardon. It\nwill perhaps be better to call our kind and worthy housekeeper.\"\n\nSir Philip perceived a thing which had escaped me, though brought to my\nnotice beforehand by our good Colonel Lougher; that is to say, how hard\nit would be upon the feelings of this young girl, to have her \"identity\"\n(as Crowner Bowles entitled it) discussed in her own presence. Therefore\nshe was led away by that regular busybody the housekeeper, Mrs\nCockhanterbury; while I begged leave to introduce Colonel Lougher and\nCaptain Bluett to Sir Philip Bampfylde. And then when all had made their\nbows and all due salutations, I was called upon to show my documents and\nexplain the evidence so carefully gathered by me.\n\nIt is as much above my power, as beyond my purpose, to tell how that\nancient and noble gentleman, after so much worry from the long neglect\nof Providence, took (as if he had never deserved it) this goodness of\nthe Lord to him. Of course, in my class of life, we cannot be always\ndwelling on children; whose nature is provoking always, and in nothing\nmore so than that they will come when not wanted; yet are not\nforthcoming with the folk who can afford them. Nevertheless, I think\nthat if the Lord had allowed any thief of a fellow (much more one of His\nown ministers) to steal two grandchildren of mine, and make a savage of\none baby, and of the other a castaway, the whole of my piety would have\nbeen very hard pushed to produce any gratitude. Sir Philip, however, did\nappear most truly desirous to thank God for this great mercy vouchsafed\nto him; even before he had thoroughly gone through the ins and outs of\nthe evidence. For he begged us to excuse him, while he should go to see\nto our comfort; and two fine bottles of wine (white and red) appeared,\nand began to disappear, under my hatches mainly, before our noble host\ncame back to set us a good example. And when he came he had quite\nforgotten to dust the knees of some fine kerseymere, and the shins of\nblack silk stockings.\n\nDeep sense of religion is quite in its place when a man has had one arm\nshot off, still more so if both arms are gone, and after a leg,\nindispensable. Nevertheless it must not be intruded upon any one; no,\nnot even by the chaplain, till the doctor shakes his head. Knowing also\nthat Colonel Lougher had a tendency towards it (enough to stop the\ndecanters if he should get upon that subject with the arguments it\nsticks fast in), I was delighted to see Delushy slipping into the room\nas if she had known the place for a century. The General clearly had\nmanaged to visit her during the time of his absence from us; what passed\nbetween them matters not, except that he must have acknowledged her. For\nnow she went up to him and kissed him; rather timidly, perhaps, but\nstill she touched his forehead. Then he arose and stood very upright, as\nif he had never begun to stoop, and passing his arm round her delicate\nwaist, both her hands he took in his. And as they faced us, we were\nstruck with the likeness between blooming youth and worn but yet\nmajestic age.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"or rather I should call you kind good friends,\nyou have brought me not only a grandchild, but the very one I would have\nchosen if the whole world gave me choice. By-and-by you shall see her\nstand by the picture of my dear and long-lamented wife. That, I think,\nwill convince you that we want no further evidence. For me, these\nthumb-nails are enough. Bertha, show your thumb-nails.\"\n\nShe laughed her usual merry laugh (although she had been crying so)\nwhile she spread her dainty hands, exactly as she used to spread them,\nwhen she was only two years old, with me alone to look at her.\n\n\"Here it is, sir,\" cried the General, overlooking me, in the rush of his\nsentiments towards the Colonel: \"here is the true Bampfylde mark. Even\nthe Bassets have it not, nor the Traceys, nor the St Albyns. Will you\noblige me by observing that these two thumb-nails have a most undoubted\nright and left to them? Bertha, do try to keep still for a moment.\"\n\n\"Well, I declare,\" said the Colonel, calmly taking out his eye-glass;\n\"yes, I declare you are right, my good sir. Here is a most evident right\nand left--Andalusia, do stand still--not only in the half-moons at the\nbase, but in the vein, and what I may call the radiants of the pinkness.\nI cannot express my meaning, but--my darling, come and kiss me.\"\n\nThis Delushy did at once, as for years she used to do; and not being\ncertain even now whether she ought to forsake the Colonel for a General,\nthough proved to be a very fine and newly-turned up Grandfather. None of\nus had thought of her, and the many shifts of female wind, coming to\npass perhaps inside her little brain and heart so. Wherefore this poor\nDavid, who desires always to be the last, but by force of nature is\ncompelled for ever to take the lead--I it was who got her off to bed,\nthat we might talk of her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVII.\n\nDOG EATS DOG.\n\n\nTo a man, whose time of life begins to be a subject of some\nconsideration to him, when the few years still in hope can be counted on\na hand, and may not need a finger; and with the tide of this world\nebbing to the inevitable sea--to him there is scarcely any sweet and\ngentle pastime more delightful than to sit on a bank of ancient moss,\nbeside a tidal river, and watch the decreasing waters, and prove his\nown eternity by casting a pebble into them.\n\nHence it was that Sir Philip Bampfylde, on the very morning after I gave\nhim back his grandchild, sate gazing into the ebb of the Tawe, some\nfifty yards below the spot, whence Jack Wildman's father carried off so\nwickedly that helpless pair of children. Here it was my privilege to\ncome up to Sir Philip, and spread before him my humble reasons for\nhaving preferred the kitchen last night to the dining-room and the\ndrawing-room. It was consistent with my nature; and he, though wishing\notherwise, agreed not to be offended.\n\nThen I asked him how the young lady (whose health every one of us had\nhonoured, all over the kitchen-table) had contrived to pass the night,\nand whether she had seen her father yet. He said she had slept pretty\nwell considering, but that as concerned her father, they had not thought\nit wise to let her see him, until the doctor came. There was no telling\nhow it might act upon Squire Philip's constitution, after so many years\nof misery, cobwebs, and desolation. For Providence had not gifted him\nwith a mind so strong as his father's was, and the sudden break in on\nthe death of the mind has been known, in such a case, to lead to bodily\ndecease. But few things vexed the General more than that wretched lie of\nChowne's, and slander upon a loyal family while in service of the Crown.\nWhat Captain Drake had landed from the boat was not an arm-chest, but a\nchest of plate and linen, belonging to his brother, which he would no\nlonger borrow, while the Squire so cruelly dealt with him.\n\nThen I asked Sir Philip whether the ancient builder over at Appledore\nhad been sent for to depose to the boat; for we had brought that little\ncraft on the top of our coach from Ilfracombe. The General said that I\nmight see him even now examining her, if I would only take the trouble\nto look round the corner; but he himself was so well convinced, without\nany further testimony, that he did not even care to hear what the old\nman had to say of it, any more than he cared for the jemmyset. This,\nhowever, is not my manner of regarding questions. Not from any private\nfountains of conviction, and so on, but out of the mouths of many\nwitnesses shall a thing be established. Therefore I hastened round the\ncorner, to sift this ancient boatwright.\n\nAs surly a fellow as ever lived, and from his repugnance to my uniform,\none who had made more money, I doubt, by the smuggler's keg than the\nshipwright's adze. Entering into his nature at sight, I took the upper\nhand of him, as my rank insisted on.\n\n\"Hark ye now, master ship-carpenter, where was this little craft put\ntogether, according to your opinion?\"\n\nEither this fellow was deaf as a post, or else he meant to insult me,\nfor he took no more notice of me than he did of the pigs that were\nsnuffling at beech-nuts down by the side of the landing-place. I am not\nthe right man to put up with insolence; therefore I screwed my\nhammer-head into the socket below my muscles, and therewith dealt him a\ntap on his hat, just to show what might come afterwards.\n\nReceiving this administration, and seeing that more was very likely from\nthe same source to be available, what did this rogue do but endeavour to\nshow the best side of his manners. Wherefore, to let him have his say,\nhere is his opinion.\n\n\"This here boat be the same as I built, year as my wife were took with\nquinzy, and were called home by the Lord. I built her for Wild-duck of\nAppledore, a little dandy-rigged craft as used to be hired by Cap'en\nBampfylde. To this here boat I can swear, although some big rogue have\nbeen at work, painting her, as knew not how to paint; and a lubber, no\ndoubt, every now and then patching her up, or repairing of her. The name\nin her stern have been painted up from 'Wild-duck, Appledore,' into\n'Santa Lucia, Salvador;' three or four letters are my own, the rest are\nthe work of some pirate. She be no more foreign-build than I be. But a\nsailor accustomed to foreign parts would be sure to reckon so, reason\nwhy I served my time with a builder over to Port-au-Prince. And I should\nlike to see the man anywhere round these here parts, as can tuck in the\nbends as I does.\"\n\nLeaving this conceited fellow to his narrow unpleasantness, I turned my\nhead, and there beheld Captain Bluett harkening.\n\n\"Come,\" he cried out, in his hearty manner, \"what a cook's boiling of\nfools we are! Here we are chewing a long-chewed quid, while the devil\nthat brewed this gale of wind may fly far away, and grin at us.\nLlewellyn, do you mean to allow----\"\n\n\"Hush,\" I said softly, for that low shipwright showed his eyes coming up\nunder his cap. And I saw that he was that particular villain, after his\nscurrilous words about me, who would sell his soul to that wretch of a\nChowne for half-a-crown a-week almost. Therefore I led our young Captain\nBluett well away out of this fellow's hearing.\n\n\"Davy,\" said he, \"we all know your courage, your readiness, and your\nresources. Still you appear to be under a spell--and you know you are\nsuperstitious about this cunning and cowardly blackguard, who frightens\nthe whole of this country, as he never could frighten Glamorganshire.\"\n\n\"I have no fear of him, sir,\" I said; \"I will go with you to confront\nhim.\"\n\n\"Why, your teeth are ready to chatter, Llewellyn; and your lips are\nblue! You who stood like a mile-stone, they tell me, at the helm of the\nGoliath, or like a clock going steadily tick, before we fired a shot,\nand with both shell and shot through your grey whiskers----\"\n\n\"But, Captain, a minister of the Lord----\"\n\n\"Master, a minister of the devil--once for all, to-day I go to horsewhip\nhim, if he is young enough; or to pull his nose if he is old enough, and\nOld Harry be with him in choice of the two? Zounds, sir, is it a thing\nto laugh at?\"\n\nRodney Bluett was well known to every one who served under him for the\nmildness of his language, and the want of oaths he had; and so, of\ncourse, for his self-control, and the power of his heart when it did\nbreak forth. Everybody loved him because he never cursed any one at a\nventure, and kept himself very close to facts, however hard driven by\ncircumstances; so that I was now amazed to hear this young man spoil my\npipe with violent emotions.\n\n\"Have you consulted Sir Philip?\" I asked. \"It is his place to take up\nthe question.\"\n\n\"What question? There is no question. The thing is proved. My duty is\nplain. Sir Philip is too old to see to it. The Squire is a spooney. The\nCommodore is not here yet. I have spoken to his wife, who is a very\nsweet and wise lady; and she agrees with me that it will save the family\na world of scandal; and perhaps failure of the law, for me to take the\nlaw into my own hands, and thrash this blackguard within an inch of his\nlife.\"\n\n\"To be sure, and save her husband from the risk of tackling a desperate\nman. It is most wise on her part. But I beg you, my dear sir, for the\nsake of your dear uncle and your good mother, keep clear of this\nquarrel. You know not the man you have to deal with. Even if you can\nthrash him, which is no easy business, he will shoot you afterwards. He\nis the deadest shot in the county.\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried Rodney, tossing up his hat; \"that entirely settles it.\nCome along, old fellow, and show us the way: and not a word to any one.\"\n\nNow this may seem a very mad resolve for a man of my sense to give into.\nBut whether I turned myself this way or that, I could see no chance of\nbettering it. If I refused to go, young Rodney (as I could see by the\nset of his mouth) would go alone, and perhaps get killed, and then how\ncould any of the family ever look at me again? On the other hand, if I\nshould go to the Colonel, or to the General, for opinion, and to beg\nthem to stop it, my interference--nine chances to one--would only end in\ngiving offence among the superior orders. Add to this my real desire to\nsquare it out with Chowne himself, after all his persecution, and you\nmay be able to forgive me for getting upon horseback, after many years\nof forbearance, and with my sugar-nippers screwed on, to lay hold by the\nforestay, if she should make bad weather. Also, I felt it my duty to\ntake a double-barrelled pistol, heavily loaded and well primed.\n\nCaptain Rodney forged ahead so on a real hunting-craft, that my dappled\ngrey, being warranted not to lurch me overboard, could not keep in line\nwhatever sail I made upon her. My chief rule in life is not to hurry.\nWhat good ever comes of it? People only abuse you, and your breath is\ntoo short to answer them. Moreover, I felt an uneasy creaking in my\nbends from dousing forward, and then easing backward, as a man must do\nwho knows how to ride. The Captain was wroth with me, out of all reason;\nbut as he could not find the way to Nympton Moors without me, I was\nenabled to take my leisure, having the surety of overgetting him when\nthe next cross-road came. Therefore it was late afternoon when we turned\ninto the black fir-grove which led up to the house of Chowne, and Rodney\nBluett clutched the big whip in his hand severely. For we had asked at\nthe little inn of which I spoke a long time ago, whether the Parson was\nnow at home.\n\n\"Ay, that 'un be,\" said the man with a grin, for we did not see the\nlandlady; \"but ye best way not to go nigh 'un.\"\n\nAlready I seemed not to feel as I hoped, in the earlier stage of the\njourney. My thoughts had been very upright for a while, and spirited,\nand delighted; but now I began to look at things from a different point\nof view almost. It is not man's business to worry his head about\nrighting of wrongs in this world, unless they are done to himself; and\nif so, revenge is its name, and an ugly one. Long life leads one to\nforgive, when to carry it on would be troublesome.\n\nThrough the drip of dying leaves, the chill of dull November now began\nto darken over us as we turned the corner of Chowne's own road, and\nfaced his lonely mansion. The house had a heavy and sullen look,\naccording to my ideas, not receiving light and pleasure of the sun when\npossible. Heavy fir-trees overhung it, never parting with their weight;\nand the sunset (when there was any) could not pierce the holm-oaks.\n\n\"What a gloomy and devilish place!\" cried Rodney Bluett, beginning to\ntremble from some unknown influence. \"Upon my soul, if I lived here, I\nshould be hatching plots myself. Or is it the nature of the man that has\nmade the place so horrible?\"\n\n\"Let us go back,\" said I; \"come back, my good sir, I conjure you. Such a\nman should be left to God, to punish in His own good time.\"\n\n\"Hark!\" cried Rodney, pulling up, and listening through the gloomy wood;\n\"that was a woman's scream, I am sure. Is he murdering some more little\nones?\"\n\nWe listened, and heard a loud piercing shriek, that made our hair stand\non end almost, so mad was it, and so unearthly; and then two more of yet\nwilder agony; and after that a long low wailing.\n\n\"On, on!\" cried Rodney Bluett; \"you know these paths, gallop on, Davy.\"\n\n\"You go first,\" I answered; \"your horse is fresher; I am coming--to be\nsure I am--do you think I am frightened?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know,\" he replied; \"but I am not ashamed to own that I\nam.\"\n\nClapping spurs to his horse, he dashed on; and thoroughly miserable as I\nfelt, there was nothing for me but to follow him.\n\nIn the name of the Lord, what a sight we came on, where the drive sweeps\nround at the corner of the house! Under a dark tree of some sort, and on\na garden bench, we discovered the figures of two women. Or rather, one\nsate on the bench; the other lay stretched on the ground, with her head\ncast recklessly back on the ledge, her hair spread in masses over it,\nand both hands pressed on her eyes and ears, to shut out sight and\nhearing. Her lips were open, and through her white teeth came wails of\nanguish, that would have been shrieks, if nature had not failed her.\n\nBut the elder woman sate upright, in scorn of all such weakness, with\nher gaunt figure drawn like a cable taut, no sign of a tear on her\nshrunken cheeks, and the whole of her face as numb and cold as an iced\nfigure-head in the Arctic seas. Yet no one, with knowledge of the human\nrace, could doubt which of these two suffered most.\n\nWe reined up our horses, and gazed in terror, for neither of them\nnoticed us; and then we heard, from inside the house, sounds that made\nour flesh creep. Barking, howling, snapping of teeth, baying as of a\nhuman bloodhound, frothy splutterings of fury, and then smothered\nyelling.\n\n\"Her have a gat 'un now,\" cried a clown, running round the end of the\nhouse, as if he were enjoying it. \"Reckon our passon wun't baite much\nmoore, after Passon Jack be atop of 'un.\"\n\n\"Oh sir, oh sir, oh for God's sake, sir,\" cried the poor lady who had\nlain on the ground, rushing up to us, and kneeling, and trying to get\nhold of us; \"you must have come to stop it, sir. Only one hour--allow\nhim one hour, dear, dear sirs, for repentance. He has not been a good\nman, I know, but I am his own wife, good kind sirs--and if he could only\nhave a little time, if it were only half an hour--he might, he\nmight----\"\n\nHere a sound of throttling came through a broken windowpane, and down\nshe fell insensible.\n\n\"What does it mean?\" cried Rodney Bluett; \"is it murder, madness, or\nsuicide? Follow me, Davy. Here I go, anyhow, into the thick of it.\"\n\nHe dashed through the window; and I with more caution, cocking my\npistol, followed him, while I heard the clown shouting after us--\n\n\"Danged vules both of 'e. Bide outside, bide outside, I tell 'e.\"\n\nOh that we had remained outside! I have been through a great deal of\nhorrible sights, enough to harden any man, and cure him of womanly\nsqueamishness. Yet never did I behold, or dream of, anything so awful as\nthe scene that lay before me. People were longing to look at it now, but\nnone (save ourselves) durst enter.\n\nIt was Chowne's own dining-room, all in the dark, except where a lamp\nhad been brought in by a trembling footman, who ran away, knowing that\nhe brought this light for his master to be strangled by. And in the\ncorner now lay his master, smothered under a feather-bed; yet with his\nvicious head fetched out in the last rabid struggle to bite. There was\nthe black hair, black face, and black tongue, shown by the frothy\nwainscot, or between it and the ticking. On the feather-bed lay\nexhausted, and with his mighty frame convulsed, so that a child might\nmaster him, Parson Jack Rambone, the strongest man, whose strength (like\nall other powers) had laid a horrible duty upon him. Sobbing with all\nhis great heart he lay, yet afraid to take his weight off, and sweating\nat every pore with labour, peril of his life, and agony.\n\n\"Oh Dick, Dick,\" he said, quite softly, and between his pantings; \"how\nmany larks have we had together, and for me to have to do this to you! I\nam sure you knew me, before you died. I think you know me now, Dick. Oh,\nfor God's sake, shut your eyes! Darling Dick, are you dead, are you\ndead? You are the very cleverest fellow ever I came across of. You can\ndo it, if you like. Oh, dear Dick, Dick, my boy, do shut your eyes!\"\n\nWe stood looking at them, with no power to go up to them; all experience\nfailed us as to what was the proper thing to do, till I saw that\nChowne's face ought to have a napkin over it. None had been laid for\ndinner; but I knew where butlers keep them.\n\nWhen I had done this, Parson Jack (who could not escape from the great\nblack eyes) arose, and said, \"I thank you, sir.\" He staggered so that we\nhad to support him; but not a word could we say to him. \"I am bitten in\ntwo places, if not more,\" he rather gasped than said to us, as he laid\nbare his enormous arms. \"I care not much. I will follow my friend. Or if\nthe Lord should please to spare me, henceforth I am an altered man. And\nyet, for the sake of my family, will you heat the kitchen poker?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\n\nTHE OLD PITCHER AT THE WELL AGAIN.\n\n\nIt helps a thoughtless man on his road towards a better kingdom, to get\na glimpse, every now and then, of such visitations of the Lord. When I\nwas a little boy, nothing did me so much good in almost all the Bible,\nas to hear my father read the way in which Herod was eaten of worms. And\nnow in mature years, I received quite a serious turn by the death of\nthis Parson Chowne of ignominious canine madness. And still more, when\nI came to know by what condign parental justice this visitation smote\nhim.\n\nFor while the women were busy up-stairs by candle-light, and with some\nweeping, it fell to Parson Rambone's lot to lay the truth before us.\nThis great man took at once to Captain Rodney Bluett, as if he had known\nhim for years; nor did he fail to remember me, and in his distress to\nseek some comfort from my simple wisdom. So having packed all the\ncountry boobies, constables, doctors, and so on, out of the house, we\nbarred the door, made a bright fire in the kitchen, and sat down in\nfront of it, while a nice cook began to toss up some sweetbreads, and\neggs and ham-collops, and so on, for our really now highly necessary\nsustenance.\n\nYou may remember the time I met with a very nice fellow (then Chowne's\nhead-groom), who gave me a capital supper of tripe elegantly stewed by a\nyoung cook-maid, himself lamenting the stress (laid upon him by\ncircumstances) not to make his wife of her. He told me then with a sigh\nof affection between his knife and fork, that social duties compelled\nhim instead to marry a publican's daughter, with fifty pounds down on\nthe nail, he believed, if it was a penny. Nevertheless he felt confident\nthat all would be ordered aright in the end. Now Providence had not\nallowed such a case of faith to pass unrewarded. He married the\npublican's daughter, got her money, and paid the last sad duties to her,\nout of the pocket of his father-in-law, in a Christian-minded manner.\nAnd then back he came to Nympton Rectory, and wedded that same\ncook-maid, who now was turning our ham so cleverly with the egg-slice.\nThus we could speak before them both, without the least constraint; and\nindeed he helped us much by his knowledge of the affairs of the family.\nAlso two Justices of the Peace, who had signed the warrant for poor\nChowne's end, upon the report of the doctors, but could find no one of\nstrength and courage to carry it out, except Parson Jack; these sate\nwith us to get their supper, before the long cold ride over the moors.\nAnd there sate Parson Jack himself, with his thick hands trembling,\nhopeless of eating a morsel, but dreading to be left alone for a moment.\n\n\"What a difference it will make in all this neighbourhood, to be sure!\"\nSo said one of their worships.\n\n\"Ay, that it will,\" answered his brother magistrate. \"Since Tom Faggus\ndied, there has not been such a man to be found, nowhere round these\nhere parts.\"\n\n\"No, nor Tom Faggus himself,\" said the other: \"a noble highwayman he\nwere; but for mind, not fit to hold a candle to our lamented friend now\nlying up there in the counterpane.\"\n\nParson Jack shuddered, and shook his great limbs, and feigned to have\ndone so on purpose; and then in defiance collected himself, and laid his\niron hand on the table, watching every great muscle, to see how long he\ncould keep it from trembling. Then I arose and grasped his hand--for\nnobody else understood him at all--and he let me take it with\nreluctance, wonder, and then deep gratitude. He had been saying to\nhimself--as I knew, though his lips never moved; and his face was set,\nin scorn of all our moralising--within himself he had been thinking, \"I\nam Jack Ketch; I am worse; I am Cain. I have murdered my own dear\nbrother.\"\n\nAnd I, who had seen him brand his bitten arm with the red hot poker,\nlaying the glowing iron on, until the blood hissed out at it, I alone\ncould gage the strength of heart that now enabled him to answer my grasp\nwith his poor scorched arm, and to show his great tears, and check them.\n\nEnough of this, I cannot stand these melancholy subjects. A man of\nirreproachable life, with a tendency towards gaiety, never must allow\nhis feelings to play ducks and drakes with him. If the justice of the\nAlmighty fell upon Chowne--as I said it would--let Chowne die, and let\nus hope that his soul was not past praying for. It is not my place to be\nwretched, because the biggest villain I ever knew showed his wit by\ndying of a disease which gave him power to snap at the very devil, when\nin the fulness of time he should come thirsting to lay hold of him. And\nbut for my purpose of proving how purely justice does come home to us,\nwell contented would I be to say no more about him. Why had he been such\na villain through life? Because he was an impostor. Why did he die of\nrabid madness, under the clutch of his own best friend? Because he\nlashed his favourite hound to fly at the throat of his own grandfather.\n\nNot only does it confirm one's faith in the honesty of breeding, but it\nenables me to acquit all the Chownes of Devonshire--and a fine and\nwholesome race they are--of ever having produced such a scamp, in true\ncourse of legitimacy; also enables me not to point out, so much as to\nleave all my readers to think of, the humble yet undeniable traces of\nold Davy's sagacity.\n\nWhat had I said to Mrs Steelyard, when she overbore me so, upon an empty\nstomach? \"Madam,\" I said, \"your son, you mean!\" And it proved to be one\nof my famous hits, at a range beyond that of other men. When great stirs\nhappen, truth comes out; as an earthquake starts the weasels.\n\nEverybody knows what fine old age those wandering gypsies come to. The\ntwo most killing cares we have, are money, and reputation. Here behold\ngypsy wisdom! The disregard of the latter of the two does away with the\nplague of the former. They take what they want; while we clumsy fellows\ntoil for the cash as the only way to get the good estimation. Hence it\nwas that Chowne's grandfather came about stealing as lively as ever, at\nthe age of ninety. A wiry and leathery man he was, and had once been a\nfamous conjurer. And now in his old age he came to sleep in his\ngrandson's barn, and to live on his grandson's ducks, potatoes, and\npigeons. This was last harvest-time, just as Chowne was enjoying his bit\nof cub-hunting.\n\nTurning in from his sport one day, in a very sulky humour, with the\nhounds he was educating, the Parson caught his grandfather withdrawing\nin a quiet manner from a snug little hen-roost. Not knowing who it was\n(for his mother had never explained a thing to him, not even that she\nwas his mother), he thought it below his dignity to ride after this old\nfellow. But at his heels stalked a tall young hound, who had vexed him\nall day by surliness, and was now whipped in for punishment.\n\n\"At him--'loo boy!\" he called out; \"Hike forrard, catch him by the leg,\nboy!\" But the hound only showed his teeth and snarled; so that Chowne\nlet out his long lash at him. In a moment the dog sprang at his master\nwho was riding a low cob-horse, and bit him in the thigh and the horse\nin the shoulder, and then skulked off to his kennel. The hound was shot,\nand the horse shared his fate in less than six weeks afterwards; and as\nfor the Parson, we know too well what they were forced to do with him.\n\nIn her first horror, that stony woman, even Mrs Steelyard, when her son\ncame ravening at her, could not keep her secret. \"It is the judgment of\nGod,\" she cried; \"after all there is a God. He set the dogs at his\ngrandfather, and now he would bite his own mother!\"\n\nHow she had managed to place him in the stead of the real Chowne heir, I\nnever heard, or at least no clear account of it; for she was not (as we\nknow already) one who would answer questions. Let him rest, whoever he\nwas. His end was bad enough, even for him.\n\nEnough of this fright--for it was a fright even to me, I assure you--let\nus come back to the innocent people injured so long by his villany.\n\nTo begin with Parson Jack. Never in all his life had he taken a stroke\ntowards his own salvation, until by that horrible job he earned\nrepentance, fear, and conscience. And not only this (for none of these\nwould have stood him in any service, with Chowne still at his elbow),\nbut that the face,--which had drawn him for years, like a loadstone of\nhell, to destruction,--now ever present in its terror, till his prayers\ngot rid of it, shone in the dark like the face of a scarecrow, if ever\nhe durst think of wickedness. His wife found the benefit of this change,\nand so did his growing family, and so did the people who flocked to his\nchurch, in the pleasure of being afraid of him. In the roads, he might\nbite; but in his surplice, he was bound to behave himself, or at least,\nhe must bite the churchwarden first. Yet no one would have him to\nsprinkle a child, until a whole year was over. And then he restored\nhimself, under a hint from a man beyond him in intellect; he made\neverybody allow that the poker had entirely cured him, by preaching from\nthe bottom of his chest, with a glass of water upon the cushion, a\nsermon that stirred every heart, with the text, \"Is thy servant a dog,\nthat he should do this thing?\"\n\nI quit him with sorrow; because I found him a man of true feeling, and\ngood tobacco. We got on together so warmly that expense alone divided\nus. He would have had me for parish-clerk, if I could have seen my way\nto it.\n\nWhat prevails with a man like me, foremost first of everything? Why,\nlove of the blessed native land--which every good Welshman will love me\nfor. I may have done a thing, now and then, below our native dignity,\nexcept to those who can enter into all the things we look at. It is not\nour nature altogether, to go for less than our value. We know that we\nare of the oldest blood to be found in this ancient island, and we ask\nnothing more than to be treated as the superior race should be.\n\nIn the presence of such great ideas, who cares what becomes of me? I\nreally feel that my marriage to Polly, and prolongation of a fine old\nbreed, scarcely ought to be spoken of. A man who has described the\nbattle of the Nile need not dwell on matrimony.\n\nHurried speech does not become me on any other subject. Everybody has\nthe right to know, and everybody does know, how the whole of North Devon\nwas filled with joy, talk, and disputation, as to Commodore Bampfylde\nand the brightness of his acquittal. They drew him from Barnstaple in a\nchaise, with only two springs broken, men having taken the horses out,\nand done their best at collar-work. He would have gladly jumped out and\nkicked them, but for the feeling of their goodwill.\n\nNothing would have detracted from this, and the feasts that were felt to\nbe due upon it, if Squire Philip had only known how not to die at a time\nwhen nobody was seasonably called on to think of death. But when he\nlearned the shame inflicted by himself on his ancient race, through\ntrusting Chowne, and misbelieving his brother out of the self-same womb;\nand, above all, when he learned that Chowne was the bastard of a gypsy,\nhe cast himself into his brother's arms, fetched one long sigh, and\ndeparted to a better world with his hat on.\n\nThis was the best thing that he could do, if he had chosen the time\naright; and it saved a world of trouble. Sir Philip felt it a good bit,\nof course; and so did Sir Drake Bampfylde. Nevertheless, if a living man\nwithdraws into a shell so calmly, what can he expect more lively than\nhis undertakers?\n\nThis was good, and left room for Harry, or rather young Philip\nBampfylde, to step into the proper shoes, and have practice how to walk\nin them. Yet he was so caught with love of service, and of the Navy, and\nso mad about Nelson, that the General could not help himself; but let\nhim go to sea again.\n\nNelson is afloat just now. The Crappos and the Dons appear to have made\nup their minds against us; and the former have the insolence to threaten\na great invasion. If I only had two arms, I would leave my Polly to howl\nabout me. As it is, they have turned me into a herring! Colonel Lougher\nhas raised a regiment, and I am first drill-sergeant!\n\nOur dear Maid of Sker would also give her beautiful son, only six months\nold, Bampfylde Lougher Bluett, to go to the wars, and to fight the\nFrench; if any one could only show her the way to do without him. He\ncocks up his toes, in a manner which proves that his feet are meant for\nratlines.\n\nHow the war is raging! I run to and fro, upon hearing of Felix Farley's\nJournal, and am only fit to talk of it. Sir Philip comes down, with his\nbest tobacco, whenever he stops at Candleston. And a craft has been\nbuilt for me on purpose, by the old fellow at Appledore, and her name it\nis the \"Maid of Sker\"--to dance across the Channel, whenever a one-armed\nman can navigate. Colonel Lougher, and even Lady Bluett, have such trust\nin me, that they cross if their dear Delushy seems to pine too much for\nher husband. And the Maid herself has brought her son, as proud as if he\ncame out of a wreck, to exhibit him to Moxy, and Roger, and Bunny, and\nStradling the clerk--in a word, to all the parish, and the\nextra-parochial district.\n\nNow I hope that nobody will ask me any more questions concerning any\none, male or female. If I cannot speak well of a person--my rule is to\nbe silent.\n\nHezekiah found his knavery altogether useless. He scraped himself home\nat last; and built a bellows-organ at Bridgend, with a 74-gun crash to\nit. His reputation is therefore up--especially since he rejoined the\nChurch--in all churches that can afford him. Yet he will not always own\nthat I was his salvation. Hepzibah prophesies nothing, except that\nPolly's little son, \"David Llewellyn,\" will do something wonderful, to\nkeep the ancient name up.\n\nIt may be so. And I think that he will. But his father never did it. How\nmany chances have I missed! How many times might I have advanced to\nstern respectability! Yet some folk will like me better, and I like\nmyself no less, for not having feigned to be more than I am--a poor\nfrail fellow.\n\nThe children still come down to the well, with three of our Bunny's\nforemost; they get between my knees, and open blue or brown eyes up at\nme. In spite of Roger Berkrolles nodding to instil more manners, some of\nthe prettiest stroke my white beard, coaxing for a story. Then they push\nforward little Davy, thinking that I spoil him so, because of his\ndecided genius giving such promise of bard-hood--already it would do you\ngood to hear him on the Jew's harp. Nevertheless I answer firmly, nine\ntimes out of ten at least--\n\n\"Little dears,\" is all I say, \"Captain Davy is getting old. It is hard\nto tell a tale, but easy to find fault with it. You tell me that my left\narm will grow quite as long as my right one, if I only will shake it\nabout, and keep a hollow sleeve on. My pets, when I get another arm, I\nwill tell you another story.\"\n\n\n                                THE END.\n\n\n\n\n                 PRINTED BY WILLIAM BLACKWOOD AND SONS.\n\n\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[A] A clear and interesting account of this mighty sand-march\nmay be found in a very learned paper by the Rev.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1162,"split":"test"}
