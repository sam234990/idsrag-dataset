{"ori_id":"269ffd1de413e4556ac009ffabd821a869fdf75d","title":"Doctor Pascal","context":"Doctor Pascal\n Pascal, a physician in Plassans for 30 years, has spent his life cataloging and chronicling the lives of his family based on his theories of heredity. Pascal believes that everyone's physical and mental health and development can be classified based on the interplay between innateness (reproduction of characteristics based in difference) and heredity (reproduction based in similarity). Using his own family as a case study, Pascal classifies the 30 descendants of his grandmother Adela\u00efde Fouque (Tante Dide) based on this model.\nPascal has developed a serum he hopes will cure hereditary and nervous diseases (including consumption) and improve if not prolong life. His niece Clotilde sees Pascal's work as denying the omnipotence of God and as a prideful attempt to comprehend the unknowable. She encourages him to destroy his work, but he refuses. (Like other members of the family, Pascal is somewhat obsessive in the pursuit of his passion.) Pascal's explains his goal as a scientist as laying the groundwork for happiness and peace by seeking and uncovering the truth, which he believes lies in the science of heredity. After he shows her the Rougon-Macquart family tree and demonstrates his refusal to sugarcoat the family's acts, Clotilde begins to agree with him. Her love for him solidifies her faith in his theories and his lifelong work.\nClotilde and Pascal eventually begin a romance, much to the chagrin of his mother F\u00e9licit\u00e9. (She is less concerned about the incestuous nature of the relationship than by the fact that the two are living together out of wedlock.) F\u00e9licit\u00e9 wants to keep the family secrets buried at any cost, including several family skeletons living nearby: her alcoholic brother-in-law Antoine Macquart and her centenarian mother-in-law Tante Dide. When Clotilde's brother Maxime asks Clotilde to come to Paris, F\u00e9licit\u00e9 sees this as an opportunity to control Pascal and access his papers to destroy them.\nPascal suffers a series of heart attacks, and Clotilde is not able to return from Paris before he dies. F\u00e9licit\u00e9 immediately burns all of Pascal's scholarly work and the documents she considers incriminating. The novel, and the entire 20-novel series, concludes with the birth of Pascal and Clotilde's son and the hope placed on him for the future of the family.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Doctor Pascal, by Emile Zola\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Serrano\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\nIn the heat of the glowing July afternoon, the room, with blinds\ncarefully closed, was full of a great calm. From the three windows,\nthrough the cracks of the old wooden shutters, came only a few scattered\nsunbeams which, in the midst of the obscurity, made a soft brightness\nthat bathed surrounding objects in a diffused and tender light. It\nwas cool here in comparison with the overpowering heat that was felt\noutside, under the fierce rays of the sun that blazed upon the front of\nthe house.\n\nStanding before the press which faced the windows, Dr. Pascal was\nlooking for a paper that he had come in search of. With doors wide\nopen, this immense press of carved oak, adorned with strong and handsome\nmountings of metal, dating from the last century, displayed within its\ncapacious depths an extraordinary collection of papers and manuscripts\nof all sorts, piled up in confusion and filling every shelf to\noverflowing. For more than thirty years the doctor had thrown into it\nevery page he wrote, from brief notes to the complete texts of his great\nworks on heredity. Thus it was that his searches here were not always\neasy. He rummaged patiently among the papers, and when he at last found\nthe one he was looking for, he smiled.\n\nFor an instant longer he remained near the bookcase, reading the note by\na golden sunbeam that came to him from the middle window. He himself,\nin this dawnlike light, appeared, with his snow-white hair and beard,\nstrong and vigorous; although he was near sixty, his color was so fresh,\nhis features were so finely cut, his eyes were still so clear, and\nhe had so youthful an air that one might have taken him, in his\nclose-fitting, maroon velvet jacket, for a young man with powdered hair.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere, Clotilde,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said at last, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou will copy this note. Ramond\nwould never be able to decipher my diabolical writing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he crossed the room and laid the paper beside the young girl, who\nstood working at a high desk in the embrasure of the window to the\nright.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, master,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered.\n\nShe did not even turn round, so engrossed was her attention with the\npastel which she was at the moment rapidly sketching in with broad\nstrokes of the crayon. Near her in a vase bloomed a stalk of hollyhocks\nof a singular shade of violet, striped with yellow. But the profile\nof her small round head, with its short, fair hair, was clearly\ndistinguishable; an exquisite and serious profile, the straight forehead\ncontracted in a frown of attention, the eyes of an azure blue, the nose\ndelicately molded, the chin firm. Her bent neck, especially, of a milky\nwhiteness, looked adorably youthful under the gold of the clustering\ncurls. In her long black blouse she seemed very tall, with her slight\nfigure, slender throat, and flexible form, the flexible slenderness\nof the divine figures of the Renaissance. In spite of her twenty-five\nyears, she still retained a childlike air and looked hardly eighteen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd,\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed the doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou will arrange the press a little. Nothing\ncan be found there any longer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, master,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she repeated, without raising her head;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cpresently.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal had turned round to seat himself at his desk, at the other end\nof the room, before the window to the left. It was a plain black wooden\ntable, and was littered also with papers and pamphlets of all sorts. And\nsilence again reigned in the peaceful semi-obscurity, contrasting with\nthe overpowering glare outside. The vast apartment, a dozen meters long\nand six wide, had, in addition to the press, only two bookcases, filled\nwith books. Antique chairs of various kinds stood around in disorder,\nwhile for sole adornment, along the walls, hung with an old _salon_\nEmpire paper of a rose pattern, were nailed pastels of flowers of\nstrange coloring dimly visible. The woodwork of three folding-doors,\nthe door opening on the hall and two others at opposite ends of the\napartment, the one leading to the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room, the other to that of\nthe young girl, as well as the cornice of the smoke-darkened ceiling,\ndated from the time of Louis XV.\n\nAn hour passed without a sound, without a breath. Then Pascal, who, as\na diversion from his work, had opened a newspaper--_Le Temps_--which had\nlain forgotten on the table, uttered a slight exclamation:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy! your father has been appointed editor of the _Epoque_, the\nprosperous republican journal which has the publishing of the papers of\nthe Tuileries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis news must have been unexpected by him, for he laughed frankly, at\nonce pleased and saddened, and in an undertone he continued:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy word! If things had been invented, they could not have been finer.\nLife is a strange thing. This is a very interesting article.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde made no answer, as if her thoughts were a hundred leagues away\nfrom what her uncle was saying. And he did not speak again, but taking\nhis scissors after he had read the article, he cut it out and pasted it\non a sheet of paper, on which he made some marginal notes in his large,\nirregular handwriting. Then he went back to the press to classify this\nnew document in it. But he was obliged to take a chair, the shelf being\nso high that he could not reach it notwithstanding his tall stature.\n\nOn this high shelf a whole series of enormous bundles of papers were\narranged in order, methodically classified. Here were papers of all\nsorts: sheets of manuscript, documents on stamped paper, articles cut\nout of newspapers, arranged in envelopes of strong blue paper, each of\nwhich bore on the outside a name written in large characters. One felt\nthat these documents were tenderly kept in view, taken out continually,\nand carefully replaced; for of the whole press, this corner was the only\none kept in order.\n\nWhen Pascal, mounted on the chair, had found the package he was looking\nfor, one of the bulkiest of the envelopes, on which was written the name\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSaccard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added to it the new document, and then replaced the whole\nunder its corresponding alphabetical letter. A moment later he had\nforgotten the subject, and was complacently straightening a pile of\npapers that were falling down. And when he at last jumped down off the\nchair, he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you are arranging the press, Clotilde, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t touch the packages at\nthe top; do you hear?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, master,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she responded, for the third time, docilely.\n\nHe laughed again, with the gaiety that was natural to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is forbidden.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know it, master.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he closed the press with a vigorous turn of the key, which he\nthen threw into a drawer of his writing table. The young girl was\nsufficiently acquainted with his researches to keep his manuscripts in\nsome degree of order; and he gladly employed her as his secretary; he\nmade her copy his notes when some _confrere_ and friend, like Dr. Ramond\nasked him to send him some document. But she was not a _savante_; he\nsimply forbade her to read what he deemed it useless that she should\nknow.\n\nAt last, perceiving her so completely absorbed in her work, his\nattention was aroused.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the matter with you, that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t open your lips?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you so taken up with the copying of those flowers that you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nspeak?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was another of the labors which he often intrusted to her--to make\ndrawings, aquarelles, and pastels, which he afterward used in his works\nas plates. Thus, for the past five years he had been making some curious\nexperiments on a collection of hollyhocks; he had obtained a whole\nseries of new colorings by artificial fecundations. She made these sorts\nof copies with extraordinary minuteness, an exactitude of design and\nof coloring so extreme that he marveled unceasingly at the\nconscientiousness of her work, and he often told her that she had a\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cgood, round, strong, clear little headpiece.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut, this time, when he approached her to look over her shoulder, he\nuttered a cry of comic fury.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere you are at your nonsense! Now you are off in the clouds again!\nWill you do me the favor to tear that up at once?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe straightened herself, her cheeks flushed, her eyes aglow with the\ndelight she took in her work, her slender fingers stained with the red\nand blue crayon that she had crushed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, master!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd in this \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaster,\u00e2\u0080\u009d so tender, so caressingly submissive, this term\nof complete abandonment by which she called him, in order to avoid using\nthe words godfather or uncle, which she thought silly, there was, for\nthe first time, a passionate accent of revolt, the revindication of a\nbeing recovering possession of and asserting itself.\n\nFor nearly two hours she had been zealously striving to produce an exact\nand faithful copy of the hollyhocks, and she had just thrown on another\nsheet a whole bunch of imaginary flowers, of dream-flowers, extravagant\nand superb. She had, at times, these abrupt shiftings, a need of\nbreaking away in wild fancies in the midst of the most precise of\nreproductions. She satisfied it at once, falling always into this\nextraordinary efflorescence of such spirit and fancy that it never\nrepeated itself; creating roses, with bleeding hearts, weeping tears of\nsulphur, lilies like crystal urns, flowers without any known form, even,\nspreading out starry rays, with corollas floating like clouds. To-day,\non a groundwork dashed in with a few bold strokes of black crayon, it\nwas a rain of pale stars, a whole shower of infinitely soft petals;\nwhile, in a corner, an unknown bloom, a bud, chastely veiled, was\nopening.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnother to nail there!\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed the doctor, pointing to the wall, on\nwhich there was already a row of strangely curious pastels. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what\nmay that represent, I ask you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe remained very grave, drawing back a step, the better to contemplate\nher work.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know nothing about it; it is beautiful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this moment appeared Martine, the only servant, become the real\nmistress of the house, after nearly thirty years of service with the\ndoctor. Although she had passed her sixtieth year, she, too, still\nretained a youthful air as she went about, silent and active, in her\neternal black gown and white cap that gave her the look of a nun, with\nher small, white, calm face, and lusterless eyes, the light in which\nseemed to have been extinguished.\n\nWithout speaking, she went and sat down on the floor before an\neasy-chair, through a rent in the old covering of which the hair was\nescaping, and drawing from her pocket a needle and a skein of worsted,\nshe set to work to mend it. For three days past she had been waiting for\nan hour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to do this piece of mending, which haunted her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile you are about it, Martine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Pascal jestingly, taking between\nboth his hands the mutinous head of Clotilde, \u00e2\u0080\u009csew me fast, too, this\nlittle noodle, which sometimes wanders off into the clouds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMartine raised her pale eyes, and looked at her master with her habitual\nair of adoration?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy does monsieur say that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause, my good girl, in very truth, I believe it is you who have\nstuffed this good little round, clear, strong headpiece full of notions\nof the other world, with all your devoutness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe two women exchanged a glance of intelligence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, monsieur! religion has never done any harm to any one. And when\npeople have not the same ideas, it is certainly better not to talk about\nthem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAn embarrassed silence followed; this was the one difference of opinion\nwhich, at times, brought about disagreements among these three united\nbeings who led so restricted a life. Martine was only twenty-nine, a\nyear older than the doctor, when she entered his house, at the time when\nhe made his _debut_ as a physician at Plassans, in a bright little house\nof the new town. And thirteen years later, when Saccard, a brother of\nPascal, sent him his daughter Clotilde, aged seven, after his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndeath and at the moment when he was about to marry again, it was she\nwho brought up the child, taking it to church, and communicating to it\na little of the devout flame with which she had always burned; while the\ndoctor, who had a broad mind, left them to their joy of believing,\nfor he did not feel that he had the right to interdict to any one the\nhappiness of faith; he contented himself later on with watching over\nthe young girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s education and giving her clear and sound ideas about\neverything. For thirteen years, during which the three had lived this\nretired life at La Souleiade, a small property situated in the outskirts\nof the town, a quarter of an hour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s walk from St. Saturnin, the\ncathedral, his life had flowed happily along, occupied in secret great\nworks, a little troubled, however, by an ever increasing uneasiness--the\ncollision, more and more violent, every day, between their beliefs.\n\nPascal took a few turns gloomily up and down the room. Then, like a man\nwho did not mince his words, he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSee, my dear, all this phantasmagoria of mystery has turned your pretty\nhead. Your good God had no need of you; I should have kept you for\nmyself alone; and you would have been all the better for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Clotilde, trembling with excitement, her clear eyes fixed boldly\nupon his, held her ground.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is you, master, who would be all the better, if you did not shut\nyourself up in your eyes of flesh. That is another thing, why do you not\nwish to see?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd Martine came to her assistance, in her own style.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed, it is true, monsieur, that you, who are a saint, as I say\neverywhere, should accompany us to church. Assuredly, God will save\nyou. But at the bare idea that you should not go straight to paradise, I\ntremble all over.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe paused, for he had before him, in open revolt, those two whom he had\nbeen accustomed to see submissive at his feet, with the tenderness of\nwomen won over by his gaiety and his goodness. Already he opened his\nmouth, and was going to answer roughly, when the uselessness of the\ndiscussion became apparent to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere! Let us have peace. I would do better to go and work. And above\nall, let no one interrupt me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith hasty steps he gained his chamber, where he had installed a sort of\nlaboratory, and shut himself up in it. The prohibition to enter it was\nformal. It was here that he gave himself up to special preparations, of\nwhich he spoke to no one. Almost immediately the slow and regular sound\nof a pestle grinding in a mortar was heard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Clotilde, smiling, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere he is, at his devil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cookery, as\ngrandmother says.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she tranquilly resumed her copying of the hollyhocks. She completed\nthe drawing with mathematical precision, she found the exact tone of\nthe violet petals, striped with yellow, even to the most delicate\ndiscoloration of the shades.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d murmured Martine, after a moment, again seated on the ground, and\noccupied in mending the chair, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat a misfortune for a good man like\nthat to lose his soul wilfully. For there is no denying it; I have known\nhim now for thirty years, and in all that time he has never so much as\nspoken an unkind word to any one. A real heart of gold, who would take\nthe bit from his own mouth. And handsome, too, and always well, and\nalways gay, a real blessing! It is a murder that he does not wish\nto make his peace with the good God. We will force him to do it,\nmademoiselle, will we not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde, surprised at hearing her speak so long at one time on the\nsubject, gave her word with a grave air.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly, Martine, it is a promise. We will force him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSilence reigned again, broken a moment afterward by the ringing of the\nbell attached to the street door below. It had been attached to the door\nso that they might have notice when any one entered the house, too vast\nfor the three persons who inhabited it. The servant appeared surprised,\nand grumbled a few words under her breath. Who could have come in such\nheat as this? She rose, opened the door, and went and leaned over the\nbalustrade; then she returned, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is Mme. Felicite.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOld Mme. Rougon entered briskly. In spite of her eighty years, she had\nmounted the stairs with the activity of a young girl; she was still the\nbrown, lean, shrill grasshopper of old. Dressed elegantly now in\nblack silk, she might still be taken, seen from behind, thanks to the\nslenderness of her figure, for some coquette, or some ambitious woman\nfollowing her favorite pursuit. Seen in front, her eyes still lighted\nup her withered visage with their fires, and she smiled with an engaging\nsmile when she so desired.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! is it you, grandmother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Clotilde, going to meet her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy,\nthis sun is enough to bake one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite, kissing her on the forehead, laughed, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, the sun is my friend!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, moving with short, quick steps, she crossed the room, and turned\nthe fastening of one of the shutters.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOpen the shutters a little! It is too gloomy to live in the dark in\nthis way. At my house I let the sun come in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThrough the opening a jet of hot light, a flood of dancing sparks\nentered. And under the sky, of the violet blue of a conflagration, the\nparched plain could be seen, stretching away in the distance, as if\nasleep or dead in the overpowering, furnace-like heat, while to the\nright, above the pink roofs, rose the belfry of St. Saturnin, a gilded\ntower with arises that, in the blinding light, looked like whitened\nbones.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Felicite, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think of going shortly to the Tulettes,\nand I wished to know if Charles were here, to take him with me. He is\nnot here--I see that--I will take him another day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut while she gave this pretext for her visit, her ferret-like eyes were\nmaking the tour of the apartment. Besides, she did not insist, speaking\nimmediately afterward of her son Pascal, on hearing the rhythmical noise\nof the pestle, which had not ceased in the adjoining chamber.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! he is still at his devil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cookery! Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disturb him, I have\nnothing to say to him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMartine, who had resumed her work on the chair, shook her head, as if\nto say that she had no mind to disturb her master, and there was silence\nagain, while Clotilde wiped her fingers, stained with crayon, on a\ncloth, and Felicite began to walk about the room with short steps,\nlooking around inquisitively.\n\nOld Mme. Rougon would soon be two years a widow. Her husband who had\ngrown so corpulent that he could no longer move, had succumbed to an\nattack of indigestion on the 3d of September, 1870, on the night of the\nday on which he had learned of the catastrophe of Sedan. The ruin of the\ngovernment of which he flattered himself with being one of the founders,\nseemed to have crushed him. Thus, Felicite affected to occupy herself no\nlonger with politics, living, thenceforward, like a dethroned queen, the\nonly surviving power of a vanished world. No one was unaware that the\nRougons, in 1851, had saved Plassans from anarchy, by causing the _coup\nd\u00e2\u0080\u0099etat_ of the 2d of December to triumph there, and that, a few\nyears later, they had won it again from the legitimist and republican\ncandidates, to give it to a Bonapartist deputy. Up to the time of the\nwar, the Empire had continued all-powerful in the town, so popular that\nit had obtained there at the plebiscite an overwhelming majority. But\nsince the disasters the town had become republican, the quarter St. Marc\nhad returned to its secret royalist intrigues, while the old quarter and\nthe new town had sent to the chamber a liberal representative, slightly\ntinged with Orleanism, and ready to take sides with the republic, if\nit should triumph. And, therefore, it was that Felicite, like the\nintelligent woman she was, had withdrawn her attention from politics,\nand consented to be nothing more than the dethroned queen of a fallen\ngovernment.\n\nBut this was still an exalted position, surrounded by a melancholy\npoetry. For eighteen years she had reigned. The tradition of her two\n_salons_, the yellow _salon_, in which the _coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099etat_ had matured,\nand the green _salon_, later the neutral ground on which the conquest\nof Plassans was completed, embellished itself with the reflection of the\nvanished past, and was for her a glorious history. And besides, she was\nvery rich. Then, too, she had shown herself dignified in her fall, never\nuttering a regret or a complaint, parading, with her eighty years,\nso long a succession of fierce appetites, of abominable maneuvers, of\ninordinate gratifications, that she became august through them. Her only\nhappiness, now, was to enjoy in peace her large fortune and her past\nroyalty, and she had but one passion left--to defend her past, to extend\nits fame, suppressing everything that might tarnish it later. Her pride,\nwhich lived on the double exploit of which the inhabitants still\nspoke, watched with jealous care, resolved to leave in existence only\ncreditable documents, those traditions which caused her to be saluted\nlike a fallen queen when she walked through the town.\n\nShe went to the door of the chamber and listened to the persistent noise\nof the pestle, which did not cease. Then, with an anxious brow, she\nreturned to Clotilde.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood Heavens! What is he making? You know that he is doing himself the\ngreatest harm with his new drug. I was told, the other day, that he came\nnear killing one of his patients.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, grandmother!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the young girl.\n\nBut she was now launched.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, exactly. The good wives say many other things, besides! Why, go\nquestion them, in the faubourg! They will tell you that he grinds dead\nmen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bones in infants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 blood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis time, while even Martine protested, Clotilde, wounded in her\naffection, grew angry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, grandmother, do not repeat such abominations! Master has so great a\nheart that he thinks only of making every one happy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, when she saw that they were both angry, Felicite, comprehending\nthat she had gone too far, resumed her coaxing manner.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, my kitten, it is not I who say those frightful things. I repeat\nto you the stupid reports they spread, so that you may comprehend that\nPascal is wrong to pay no heed to public opinion. He thinks he has found\na new remedy--nothing could be better! and I will even admit that he\nwill be able to cure everybody, as he hopes. Only, why affect these\nmysterious ways; why not speak of the matter openly; why, above all, try\nit only on the rabble of the old quarter and of the country, instead of,\nattempting among the well-to-do people of the town, striking cures which\nwould do him honor? No, my child, you see your uncle has never been able\nto act like other people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe had assumed a grieved tone, lowering her voice, to display the\nsecret wound of her heart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod be thanked! it is not men of worth who are wanting in our family;\nmy other sons have given me satisfaction enough. Is it not so? Your\nUncle Eugene rose high enough, minister for twelve years, almost\nemperor! And your father himself handled many a million, and had a part\nin many a one of the great works which have made Paris a new city. Not\nto speak at all of your brother, Maxime, so rich, so distinguished, nor\nof your cousin, Octave Mouret, one of the kings of the new commerce, nor\nof our dear Abbe Mouret, who is a saint! Well, then, why does Pascal,\nwho might have followed in the footsteps of them all, persist in living\nin his hole, like an eccentric old fool?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd as the young girl was again going to protest, she closed her mouth,\nwith a caressing gesture of her hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, let me finish. I know very well that Pascal is not a fool, that\nhe has written remarkable works, that his communications to the Academy\nof Medicine have even won for him a reputation among _savants_. But what\ndoes that count for, compared to what I have dreamed of for him?\nYes, all the best practice of the town, a large fortune, the\ndecoration--honors, in short, and a position worthy of the family. My\nword! I used to say to him when he was a child: \u00e2\u0080\u0098But where do you come\nfrom? You are not one of us!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 As for me, I have sacrificed everything\nfor the family; I would let myself be hacked to pieces, that the family\nmight always be great and glorious!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe straightened her small figure, she seemed to grow tall with the\none passion that had formed the joy and pride of her life. But as she\nresumed her walk, she was startled by suddenly perceiving on the floor\nthe copy of the _Temps_, which the doctor had thrown there, after\ncutting out the article, to add it to the Saccard papers, and the light\nfrom the open window, falling full upon the sheet, enlightened her, no\ndoubt, for she suddenly stopped walking, and threw herself into a chair,\nas if she at last knew what she had come to learn.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour father has been appointed editor of the _Epoque_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said\nabruptly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Clotilde tranquilly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaster told me so; it was in the\npaper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith an anxious and attentive expression, Felicite looked at her,\nfor this appointment of Saccard, this rallying to the republic, was\nsomething of vast significance. After the fall of the empire he had\ndared return to France, notwithstanding his condemnation as director of\nthe Banque Universelle, the colossal fall of which had preceded that\nof the government. New influences, some incredible intrigue must have\nplaced him on his feet again, for not only had he received his pardon,\nbut he was once more in a position to undertake affairs of considerable\nimportance, launched into journalism, having his share again of all the\ngood things going. And the recollection came to her of the quarrels of\nother days between him and his brother Eugene Rougon, whom he had so\noften compromised, and whom, by an ironical turn of events, he was\nperhaps going to protect, now that the former minister of the Empire\nwas only a simple deputy, resigned to the single role of standing by\nhis fallen master with the obstinacy with which his mother stood by\nher family. She still obeyed docilely the orders of her eldest son, the\ngenius, fallen though he was; but Saccard, whatever he might do, had\nalso a part in her heart, from his indomitable determination to succeed,\nand she was also proud of Maxime, Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brother, who had taken up\nhis quarters again, after the war, in his mansion in the Avenue of the\nBois de Boulogne, where he was consuming the fortune left him by his\nwife, Louise de Mareuil, become prudent, with the wisdom of a man struck\nin a vital part, and trying to cheat the paralysis which threatened him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEditor of the _Epoque_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she repeated; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is really the position of\na minister which your father has won. And I forgot to tell you, I have\nwritten again to your brother, to persuade him to come and see us. That\nwould divert him, it would do him good. Then, there is that child, that\npoor Charles--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did not continue. This was another of the wounds from which her\npride bled; a son whom Maxime had had when seventeen by a servant, and\nwho now, at the age of fifteen, weak of intellect, a half-idiot, lived\nat Plassans, going from the house of one to that of another, a burden to\nall.\n\nShe remained silent a moment longer, waiting for some remark from\nClotilde, some transition by which she might come to the subject she\nwished to touch upon. When she saw that the young girl, occupied in\narranging the papers on her desk, was no longer listening, she came to\na sudden decision, after casting a glance at Martine, who continued\nmending the chair, as if she were deaf and dumb.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour uncle cut the article out of the _Temps_, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde smiled calmly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, master put it away among his papers. Ah! how many notes he buries\nin there! Births, deaths, the smallest event in life, everything goes in\nthere. And the genealogical tree is there also, our famous genealogical\ntree, which he keeps up to date!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe eyes of old Mme. Rougon flamed. She looked fixedly at the young\ngirl.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know them, those papers?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no, grandmother; master has never spoken to me of them; and he has\nforbidden me to touch them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut she did not believe her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome! you have them under your hands, you must have read them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nVery simple, with her calm rectitude, Clotilde answered, smilingly\nagain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, when master forbids me to do anything, it is because he has his\nreasons, and I do not do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, my child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Felicite vehemently, dominated by her passion,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cyou, whom Pascal loves tenderly, and whom he would listen to, perhaps,\nyou ought to entreat him to burn all that, for if he should chance to\ndie, and those frightful things which he has in there were to be found,\nwe should all be dishonored!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAh, those abominable papers! she saw them at night, in her nightmares,\nrevealing in letters of fire, the true histories, the physiological\nblemishes of the family, all that wrong side of her glory which she\nwould have wished to bury forever with the ancestors already dead! She\nknew how it was that the doctor had conceived the idea of collecting\nthese documents at the beginning of his great studies on heredity; how\nhe had found himself led to take his own family as an example, struck by\nthe typical cases which he saw in it, and which helped to support laws\ndiscovered by him. Was it not a perfectly natural field of observation,\nclose at hand and with which he was thoroughly familiar? And with the\nfine, careless justness of the scientist, he had been accumulating for\nthe last thirty years the most private data, collecting and classifying\neverything, raising this genealogical tree of the Rougon-Macquarts,\nof which the voluminous papers, crammed full of proofs, were only the\ncommentary.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Mme. Rougon hotly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto the fire, to the fire with\nall those papers that would tarnish our name!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd as the servant rose to leave the room, seeing the turn the\nconversation was taking, she stopped her by a quick gesture.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, Martine; stay! You are not in the way, since you are now one of\nthe family.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, in a hissing voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA collection of falsehoods, of gossip, all the lies that our enemies,\nenraged by our triumph, hurled against us in former days! Think a little\nof that, my child. Against all of us, against your father, against your\nmother, against your brother, all those horrors!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut how do you know they are horrors, grandmother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was disconcerted for a moment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, well; I suspect it! Where is the family that has not had\nmisfortunes which might be injuriously interpreted? Thus, the mother of\nus all, that dear and venerable Aunt Dide, your great-grandmother,\nhas she not been for the past twenty-one years in the madhouse at the\nTulettes? If God has granted her the grace of allowing her to live to\nthe age of one hundred and four years, he has also cruelly afflicted her\nin depriving her of her reason. Certainly, there is no shame in that;\nonly, what exasperates me--what must not be--is that they should say\nafterward that we are all mad. And, then, regarding your grand-uncle\nMacquart, too, deplorable rumors have been spread. Macquart had his\nfaults in past days, I do not seek to defend him. But to-day, is he not\nliving very reputably on his little property at the Tulettes, two steps\naway from our unhappy mother, over whom he watches like a good son? And\nlisten! one last example. Your brother, Maxime, committed a great fault\nwhen he had by a servant that poor little Charles, and it is certain,\nbesides, that the unhappy child is of unsound mind. No matter. Will\nit please you if they tell you that your nephew is degenerate; that he\nreproduces from four generations back, his great-great-grandmother the\ndear woman to whom we sometimes take him, and with whom he likes so much\nto be? No! there is no longer any family possible, if people begin to\nlay bare everything--the nerves of this one, the muscles of that. It is\nenough to disgust one with living!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde, standing in her long black blouse, had listened to her\ngrandmother attentively. She had grown very serious; her arms hung by\nher sides, her eyes were fixed upon the ground. There was silence for a\nmoment; then she said slowly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is science, grandmother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cScience!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Felicite, trotting about again. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA fine thing, their\nscience, that goes against all that is most sacred in the world! When\nthey shall have demolished everything they will have advanced greatly!\nThey kill respect, they kill the family, they kill the good God!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say that, madame!\u00e2\u0080\u009d interrupted Martine, in a grieved voice,\nher narrow devoutness wounded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not say that M. Pascal kills the good\nGod!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, my poor girl, he kills him. And look you, it is a crime, from the\nreligious point of view, to let one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self be damned in that way. You do\nnot love him, on my word of honor! No, you do not love him, you two who\nhave the happiness of believing, since you do nothing to bring him back\nto the right path. Ah! if I were in your place, I would split that press\nopen with a hatchet. I would make a famous bonfire with all the insults\nto the good God which it contains!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe had planted herself before the immense press and was measuring\nit with her fiery glance, as if to take it by assault, to sack it, to\ndestroy it, in spite of the withered and fragile thinness of her eighty\nyears. Then, with a gesture of ironical disdain:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf, even with his science, he could know everything!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde remained for a moment absorbed in thought, her gaze lost in\nvacancy. Then she said in an undertone, as if speaking to herself:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is true, he cannot know everything. There is always something else\nbelow. That is what irritates me; that is what makes us quarrel: for I\ncannot, like him, put the mystery aside. I am troubled by it, so much\nso that I suffer cruelly. Below, what wills and acts in the shuddering\ndarkness, all the unknown forces--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHer voice had gradually become lower and now dropped to an indistinct\nmurmur.\n\nThen Martine, whose face for a moment past had worn a somber expression,\ninterrupted in her turn:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it was true, however, mademoiselle, that monsieur would be damned on\naccount of those villainous papers, tell me, ought we to let it happen?\nFor my part, look you, if he were to tell me to throw myself down from\nthe terrace, I would shut my eyes and throw myself, because I know that\nhe is always right. But for his salvation! Oh! if I could, I would work\nfor that, in spite of him. In every way, yes! I would force him; it is\ntoo cruel to me to think that he will not be in heaven with us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are quite right, my girl,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Felicite approvingly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou, at\nleast, love your master in an intelligent fashion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBetween the two, Clotilde still seemed irresolute. In her, belief did\nnot bend to the strict rule of dogma; the religious sentiment did not\nmaterialize in the hope of a paradise, of a place of delights, where she\nwas to meet her own again. It was in her simply a need of a beyond, a\ncertainty that the vast world does not stop short at sensation, that\nthere is a whole unknown world, besides, which must be taken into\naccount. But her grandmother, who was so old, this servant, who was so\ndevoted, shook her in her uneasy affection for her uncle. Did they not\nlove him better, in a more enlightened and more upright fashion, they\nwho desired him to be without a stain, freed from his manias as a\nscientist, pure enough to be among the elect? Phrases of devotional\nbooks recurred to her; the continual battle waged against the spirit of\nevil; the glory of conversions effected after a violent struggle. What\nif she set herself to this holy task; what if, after all, in spite of\nhimself, she should be able to save him! And an exaltation gradually\ngained her spirit, naturally inclined to adventurous enterprises.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said at last, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should be very happy if he would not\npersist in his notion of heaping up all those scraps of paper, and if he\nwould come to church with us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSeeing her about to yield, Mme. Rougon cried out that it was necessary\nto act, and Martine herself added the weight of all her real authority.\nThey both approached the young girl, and began to instruct her, lowering\ntheir voices as if they were engaged in a conspiracy, whence was to\nresult a miraculous benefit, a divine joy with which the whole house\nwould be perfumed. What a triumph if they reconciled the doctor with\nGod! and what sweetness, afterward, to live altogether in the celestial\ncommunion of the same faith!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then, what must I do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Clotilde, vanquished, won over.\n\nBut at this moment the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pestle was heard in the silence, with\nits continued rhythm. And the victorious Felicite, who was about to\nspeak, turned her head uneasily, and looked for a moment at the door of\nthe adjoining chamber. Then, in an undertone, she said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know where the key of the press is?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde answered only with an artless gesture, that expressed all her\nrepugnance to betray her master in this way.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a child you are! I swear to you that I will take nothing; I will\nnot even disturb anything. Only as we are alone and as Pascal never\nreappears before dinner, we might assure ourselves of what there is in\nthere, might we not? Oh! nothing but a glance, on my word of honor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young girl stood motionless, unwilling, still, to give her consent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then, it may be that I am mistaken; no doubt there are none of\nthose bad things there that I have told you of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was decisive; she ran to take the key from the drawer, and she\nherself opened wide the press.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere, grandmother, the papers are up there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMartine had gone, without a word, to station herself at the door of the\ndoctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chamber, her ear on the alert, listening to the pestle, while\nFelicite, as if riveted to the spot by emotion, regarded the papers. At\nlast, there they were, those terrible documents, the nightmare that had\npoisoned her life! She saw them, she was going to touch them, to\ncarry them away! And she reached up, straining her little legs, in the\neagerness of her desire.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is too high, my kitten,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHelp me; give them to me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! not that, grandmother! Take a chair!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite took a chair, and mounted slowly upon it. But she was still too\nshort. By an extraordinary effort she raised herself, lengthening her\nstature until she was able to touch the envelopes of strong blue paper\nwith the tips of her fingers; and her fingers traveled over them,\ncontracting nervously, scratching like claws. Suddenly there was a\ncrash--it was a geological specimen, a fragment of marble that had been\non a lower shelf, and that she had just thrown down.\n\nInstantly the pestle stopped, and Martine said in a stifled voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake care; here he comes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Felicite, grown desperate, did not hear, did not let go her hold\nwhen Pascal entered hastily. He had supposed that some accident had\nhappened, that some one had fallen, and he stood stupefied at what he\nsaw--his mother on the chair, her arm still in the air, while Martine\nhad withdrawn to one side, and Clotilde, very pale, stood waiting,\nwithout turning her head. When he comprehended the scene, he himself\nbecame as white as a sheet. A terrible anger arose within him.\n\nOld Mme. Rougon, however, troubled herself in no wise. When she saw that\nthe opportunity was lost, she descended from the chair, without making\nany illusion whatever to the task at which he had surprised her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, it is you! I do not wish to disturb you. I came to embrace\nClotilde. But here I have been talking for nearly two hours, and I must\nrun away at once. They will be expecting me at home; they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know\nwhat has become of me at this hour. Good-by until Sunday.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe went away quite at her ease, after smiling at her son, who stood\nbefore her silent and respectful. It was an attitude that he had long\nsince adopted, to avoid an explanation which he felt must be cruel, and\nwhich he had always feared. He knew her, he was willing to pardon her\neverything, in his broad tolerance as a scientist, who made allowance\nfor heredity, environment, and circumstances. And, then, was she not\nhis mother? That ought to have sufficed, for, in spite of the frightful\nblows which his researches inflicted upon the family, he preserved a\ngreat affection for those belonging to him.\n\nWhen his mother was no longer there, his anger burst forth, and fell\nupon Clotilde. He had turned his eyes away from Martine, and fixed them\non the young girl, who did not turn hers away, however, with a courage\nwhich accepted the responsibility of her act.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou! you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said at last.\n\nHe seized her arm, and pressed it until she cried. But she continued\nto look him full in the face, without quailing before him, with\nthe indomitable will of her individuality, of her selfhood. She was\nbeautiful and provoking, with her tall, slender figure, robed in\nits black blouse; and her exquisite, youthful fairness, her straight\nforehead, her finely cut nose, her firm chin, took on something of a\nwarlike charm in her rebellion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou, whom I have made, you who are my pupil, my friend, my other mind,\nto whom I have given a part of my heart and of my brain! Ah, yes! I\nshould have kept you entirely for myself, and not have allowed your\nstupid good God to take the best part of you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, monsieur, you blaspheme!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Martine, who had approached him, in\norder to draw upon herself a part of his anger.\n\nBut he did not even see her. Only Clotilde existed for him. And he was\nas if transfigured, stirred up by so great a passion that his handsome\nface, crowned by his white hair, framed by his white beard, flamed with\nyouthful passion, with an immense tenderness that had been wounded and\nexasperated.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou, you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he repeated in a trembling voice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I! Why then, master, should I not love you better than you love\nme? And why, if I believe you to be in peril, should I not try to save\nyou? You are greatly concerned about what I think; you would like well\nto make me think as you do!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe had never before defied him in this way.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you are a little girl; you know nothing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I am a soul, and you know no more about souls than I do!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe released her arm, and waved his hand vaguely toward heaven, and\nthen a great silence fell--a silence full of grave meaning, of the\nuselessness of the discussion which he did not wish to enter upon.\nThrusting her aside rudely, he crossed over to the middle window and\nopened the blinds, for the sun was declining, and the room was growing\ndark. Then he returned.\n\nBut she, feeling a need of air and space, went to the open window. The\nburning rain of sparks had ceased, and there fell now, from on high,\nonly the last shiver of the overheated and paling sky; and from the\nstill burning earth ascended warm odors, with the freer respiration of\nevening. At the foot of the terrace was the railroad, with the outlying\ndependencies of the station, of which the buildings were to be seen in\nthe distance; then, crossing the vast arid plain, a line of trees marked\nthe course of the Viorne, beyond which rose the hills of Sainte-Marthe,\nred fields planted with olive trees, supported on terraces by walls of\nuncemented stones and crowned by somber pine woods--broad amphitheaters,\nbare and desolate, corroded by the heats of summer, of the color of old\nbaked brick, which this fringe of dark verdure, standing out against the\nbackground of the sky, bordered above. To the left opened the gorges of\nthe Seille, great yellow stones that had broken away from the soil, and\nlay in the midst of blood-colored fields, dominated by an immense band\nof rocks like the wall of a gigantic fortress; while to the right, at\nthe very entrance to the valley through which flowed the Viorne, rose,\none above another, the discolored pink-tiled roofs of the town of\nPlassans, the compact and confused mass of an old town, pierced by the\ntops of ancient elms, and dominated by the high tower of St. Saturnin,\nsolitary and serene at this hour in the limpid gold of sunset.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, my God!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Clotilde slowly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cone must be arrogant, indeed, to\nimagine that one can take everything in one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand and know everything!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal had just mounted on the chair to assure himself that not one of\nhis packages was missing. Then he took up the fragment of marble, and\nreplaced it on the shelf, and when he had again locked the press with a\nvigorous turn of the hand, he put the key into his pocket.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied; \u00e2\u0080\u009ctry not to know everything, and above all, try\nnot to bewilder your brain about what we do not know, what we shall\ndoubtless never know!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMartine again approached Clotilde, to lend her her support, to show her\nthat they both had a common cause. And now the doctor perceived her,\nalso, and felt that they were both united in the same desire for\nconquest. After years of secret attempts, it was at last open war; the\n_savant_ saw his household turn against his opinions, and menace them\nwith destruction. There is no worse torture than to have treason in\none\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own home, around one; to be trapped, dispossessed, crushed, by\nthose whom you love, and who love you!\n\nSuddenly this frightful idea presented itself to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd yet both of you love me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried.\n\nHe saw their eyes grow dim with tears; he was filled with an infinite\nsadness, on this tranquil close of a beautiful day. All his gaiety, all\nhis kindness of heart, which came from his intense love of life, were\nshaken by it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, my dear! and you, my poor girl,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are doing this for\nmy happiness, are you not? But, alas, how unhappy we are going to be!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\nOn the following morning Clotilde was awake at six o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock. She had gone\nto bed angry with Pascal; they were at variance with each other. And her\nfirst feeling was one of uneasiness, of secret distress, an instant need\nof making her peace, so that she might no longer have upon her heart the\nheavy weight that lay there now.\n\nSpringing quickly out of bed, she went and half opened the shutters of\nboth windows. The sun, already high, sent his light across the chamber\nin two golden bars. Into this drowsy room that exhaled a sweet odor of\nyouth, the bright morning brought with it fresh, cheerful air; but the\nyoung girl went back and sat down on the edge of the bed in a thoughtful\nattitude, clad only in her scant nightdress, which made her look still\nmore slender, with her long tapering limbs, her strong, slender body,\nwith its round throat, round neck, round and supple arms; and her\nadorable neck and throat, of a milky whiteness, had the exquisite\nsoftness and smoothness of white satin. For a long time, at the\nungraceful age between twelve and eighteen, she had looked awkwardly\ntall, climbing trees like a boy. Then, from the ungainly hoyden had been\nevolved this charming, delicate and lovely creature.\n\nWith absent gaze she sat looking at the walls of the chamber. Although\nLa Souleiade dated from the last century, it must have been refurnished\nunder the First Empire, for it was hung with an old-fashioned printed\ncalico, with a pattern representing busts of the Sphinx, and garlands\nof oak leaves. Originally of a bright red, this calico had faded to a\npink--an undecided pink, inclining to orange. The curtains of the\ntwo windows and of the bed were still in existence, but it had been\nnecessary to clean them, and this had made them still paler. And this\nfaded purple, this dawnlike tint, so delicately soft, was in truth\nexquisite. As for the bed, covered with the same stuff, it had come down\nfrom so remote an antiquity that it had been replaced by another bed\nfound in an adjoining room; another Empire bed, low and very broad,\nof massive mahogany, ornamented with brasses, its four square pillars\nadorned also with busts of the Sphinx, like those on the wall. The\nrest of the furniture matched, however--a press, with whole doors and\npillars; a chest of drawers with a marble top, surrounded by a railing;\na tall and massive cheval-glass, a large lounge with straight feet, and\nseats with straight, lyre-shaped backs. But a coverlet made of an old\nLouis XV. silk skirt brightened the majestic bed, that occupied the\nmiddle of the wall fronting the windows; a heap of cushions made the\nlounge soft; and there were, besides, two _etageres_ and a table also\ncovered with old flowered silk, at the further end of the room.\n\nClotilde at last put on her stockings and slipped on a morning gown of\nwhite _pique_, and thrusting the tips of her feet into her gray canvas\nslippers, she ran into her dressing-room, a back room looking out on the\nrear of the house. She had had it hung plainly with an _ecru_ drill with\nblue stripes, and it contained only furniture of varnished pine--the\ntoilette table, two presses, and two chairs. It revealed, however, a\nnatural and delicate coquetry which was very feminine. This had grown\nwith her at the same time with her beauty. Headstrong and boyish though\nshe still was at times, she had become a submissive and affectionate\nwoman, desiring to be loved, above everything. The truth was that she\nhad grown up in freedom, without having learned anything more than to\nread and write, having acquired by herself, later, while assisting her\nuncle, a vast fund of information. But there had been no plan settled\nupon between them. He had not wished to make her a prodigy; she had\nmerely conceived a passion for natural history, which revealed to her\nthe mysteries of life. And she had kept her innocence unsullied like a\nfruit which no hand has touched, thanks, no doubt, to her unconscious\nand religious waiting for the coming of love--that profound feminine\nfeeling which made her reserve the gift of her whole being for the man\nwhom she should love.\n\nShe pushed back her hair and bathed her face; then, yielding to her\nimpatience, she again softly opened the door of her chamber and ventured\nto cross the vast workroom, noiselessly and on tiptoe. The shutters were\nstill closed, but she could see clearly enough not to stumble against\nthe furniture. When she was at the other end before the door of the\ndoctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room, she bent forward, holding her breath. Was he already up?\nWhat could he be doing? She heard him plainly, walking about with short\nsteps, dressing himself, no doubt. She never entered this chamber in\nwhich he chose to hide certain labors; and which thus remained closed,\nlike a tabernacle. One fear had taken possession of her; that of being\ndiscovered here by him if he should open the door; and the agitation\nproduced by the struggle between her rebellious pride and a desire\nto show her submission caused her to grow hot and cold by turns, with\nsensations until now unknown to her. For an instant her desire for\nreconciliation was so strong that she was on the point of knocking.\nThen, as footsteps approached, she ran precipitately away.\n\nUntil eight o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock Clotilde was agitated by an ever-increasing\nimpatience. At every instant she looked at the clock on the mantelpiece\nof her room; an Empire clock of gilded bronze, representing Love leaning\nagainst a pillar, contemplating Time asleep.\n\nEight was the hour at which she generally descended to the dining-room\nto breakfast with the doctor. And while waiting she made a careful\ntoilette, arranged her hair, and put on another morning gown of white\nmuslin with red spots. Then, having still a quarter of an hour on her\nhands, she satisfied an old desire and sat down to sew a piece of narrow\nlace, an imitation of Chantilly, on her working blouse, that black\nblouse which she had begun to find too boyish, not feminine enough.\nBut on the stroke of eight she laid down her work, and went downstairs\nquickly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are going to breakfast entirely alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Martine tranquilly to\nher, when she entered the dining-room.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow is that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, the doctor called me, and I passed him in his egg through the\nhalf-open door. There he is again, at his mortar and his filter. We\nwon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see him now before noon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde turned pale with disappointment. She drank her milk standing,\ntook her roll in her hand, and followed the servant into the\nkitchen. There were on the ground floor, besides this kitchen and the\ndining-room, only an uninhabited room in which the potatoes were stored,\nand which had formerly been used as an office by the doctor, when he\nreceived his patients in his house--the desk and the armchair had years\nago been taken up to his chamber--and another small room, which opened\ninto the kitchen; the old servant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room, scrupulously clean, and\nfurnished with a walnut chest of drawers and a bed like a nun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s with\nwhite hangings.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think he has begun to make his liquor again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Clotilde.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, it can be only that. You know that he thinks of neither eating\nnor drinking when that takes possession of him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen all the young girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vexation was exhaled in a low plaint:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, my God! my God!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd while Martine went to make up her room, she took an umbrella from\nthe hall stand and went disconsolately to eat her roll in the garden,\nnot knowing now how she should occupy her time until midday.\n\nIt was now almost seventeen years since Dr. Pascal, having resolved\nto leave his little house in the new town, had bought La Souleiade for\ntwenty thousand francs, in order to live there in seclusion, and also\nto give more space and more happiness to the little girl sent him by his\nbrother Saccard from Paris. This Souleiade, situated outside the town\ngates on a plateau dominating the plain, was part of a large estate\nwhose once vast grounds were reduced to less than two hectares in\nconsequence of successive sales, without counting that the construction\nof the railroad had taken away the last arable fields. The house itself\nhad been half destroyed by a conflagration and only one of the two\nbuildings remained--a quadrangular wing \u00e2\u0080\u009cof four walls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as they say in\nProvence, with five front windows and roofed with large pink tiles.\nAnd the doctor, who had bought it completely furnished, had contented\nhimself with repairing it and finishing the boundary walls, so as to be\nundisturbed in his house.\n\nGenerally Clotilde loved this solitude passionately; this narrow\nkingdom which she could go over in ten minutes, and which still retained\nremnants of its past grandeur. But this morning she brought there\nsomething like a nervous disquietude. She walked for a few moments along\nthe terrace, at the two extremities of which stood two secular cypresses\nlike two enormous funeral tapers, which could be seen three leagues off.\nThe slope then descended to the railroad, walls of uncemented stones\nsupporting the red earth, in which the last vines were dead; and on\nthese giant steps grew only rows of olive and almond trees, with sickly\nfoliage. The heat was already overpowering; she saw the little lizards\nrunning about on the disjointed flags, among the hairy tufts of caper\nbushes.\n\nThen, as if irritated by the vast horizon, she crossed the orchard and\nthe kitchen garden, which Martine still persisted in cultivating in\nspite of her age, calling in a man only twice a week for the heavier\nlabors; and she ascended to a little pine wood on the right, all that\nremained of the superb pines which had formerly covered the plateau;\nbut, here, too, she was ill at ease; the pine needles crackled under her\nfeet, a resinous, stifling odor descended from the branches. And walking\nalong the boundary wall past the entrance gate, which opened on the\nroad to Les Fenouilleres, three hundred meters from the first houses of\nPlassans, she emerged at last on the threshing-yard; an immense yard,\nfifteen meters in radius, which would of itself have sufficed to prove\nthe former importance of the domain. Ah! this antique area, paved with\nsmall round stones, as in the days of the Romans; this species of vast\nesplanade, covered with short dry grass of the color of gold as with a\nthick woolen carpet; how joyously she had played there in other days,\nrunning about, rolling on the grass, lying for hours on her back,\nwatching the stars coming out one by one in the depths of the\nillimitable sky!\n\nShe opened her umbrella again, and crossed the yard with slower steps.\nNow she was on the left of the terrace. She had made the tour of the\nestate, so that she had returned by the back of the house, through the\nclump of enormous plane trees that on this side cast a thick shade. This\nwas the side on which opened the two windows of the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room. And\nshe raised her eyes to them, for she had approached only in the sudden\nhope of at last seeing him. But the windows remained closed, and she\nwas wounded by this as by an unkindness to herself. Then only did\nshe perceive that she still held in her hand her roll, which she had\nforgotten to eat; and she plunged among the trees, biting it impatiently\nwith her fine young teeth.\n\nIt was a delicious retreat, this old quincunx of plane trees, another\nremnant of the past splendor of La Souleiade. Under these giant trees,\nwith their monstrous trunks, there was only a dim light, a greenish\nlight, exquisitely cool, even on the hottest days of summer. Formerly\na French garden had been laid out here, of which only the box borders\nremained; bushes which had habituated themselves to the shade, no doubt,\nfor they grew vigorously, as tall as trees. And the charm of this\nshady nook was a fountain, a simple leaden pipe fixed in the shaft of\na column; whence flowed perpetually, even in the greatest drought, a\nthread of water as thick as the little finger, which supplied a large\nmossy basin, the greenish stones of which were cleaned only once in\nthree or four years. When all the wells of the neighborhood were dry,\nLa Souleiade still kept its spring, of which the great plane trees were\nassuredly the secular children. Night and day for centuries past this\nslender thread of water, unvarying and continuous, had sung the same\npure song with crystal sound.\n\nClotilde, after wandering awhile among the bushes of box, which reached\nto her shoulder, went back to the house for a piece of embroidery, and\nreturning with it, sat down at a stone table beside the fountain. Some\ngarden chairs had been placed around it, and they often took coffee\nhere. And after this she affected not to look up again from her work,\nas if she was completely absorbed in it. Now and then, while seeming to\nlook between the trunks of trees toward the sultry distance, toward the\nyard, on which the sun blazed fiercely and which glowed like a brazier,\nshe stole a glance from under her long lashes up to the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwindows. Nothing appeared, not a shadow. And a feeling of sadness, of\nresentment, arose within her at this neglect, this contempt in which he\nseemed to hold her after their quarrel of the day before. She who had\ngot up with so great a desire to make peace at once! He was in no hurry,\nhowever; he did not love her then, since he could be satisfied to live\nat variance with her. And gradually a feeling of gloom took possession\nof her, her rebellious thoughts returned, and she resolved anew to yield\nin nothing.\n\nAt eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, before setting her breakfast on the fire, Martine\ncame to her for a moment, the eternal stocking in her hand which she\nwas always knitting even while walking, when she was not occupied in the\naffairs of the house.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know that he is still shut up there like a wolf in his hole, at\nhis villainous cookery?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde shrugged her shoulders, without lifting her eyes from her\nembroidery.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then, mademoiselle, if you only knew what they say! Mme. Felicite\nwas right yesterday when she said that it was really enough to make one\nblush. They threw it in my face that he had killed old Boutin, that\npoor old man, you know, who had the falling sickness and who died on\nthe road. To believe those women of the faubourg, every one into whom he\ninjects his remedy gets the true cholera from it, without counting that\nthey accuse him of having taken the devil into partnership.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA short silence followed. Then, as the young girl became more gloomy\nthan before, the servant resumed, moving her fingers still more rapidly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs for me, I know nothing about the matter, but what he is making there\nenrages me. And you, mademoiselle, do you approve of that cookery?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt last Clotilde raised her head quickly, yielding to the flood of\npassion that swept over her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen; I wish to know no more about it than you do, but I think that\nhe is on a very dangerous path. He no longer loves us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes, mademoiselle; he loves us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no; not as we love him. If he loved us, he would be here with us,\ninstead of endangering his soul and his happiness and ours, up there, in\nhis desire to save everybody.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd the two women looked at each other for a moment with eyes burning\nwith affection, in their jealous anger. Then they resumed their work in\nsilence, enveloped in shadow.\n\nAbove, in his room, Dr. Pascal was working with the serenity of perfect\njoy. He had practised his profession for only about a dozen years, from\nhis return to Paris up to the time when he had retired to La Souleiade.\nSatisfied with the hundred and odd thousand francs which he had\nearned and which he had invested prudently, he devoted himself almost\nexclusively to his favorite studies, retaining only a practise among\nfriends, never refusing to go to the bedside of a patient but never\nsending in his account. When he was paid he threw the money into a\ndrawer in his writing desk, regarding this as pocket-money for his\nexperiments and caprices, apart from his income which sufficed for his\nwants. And he laughed at the bad reputation for eccentricity which his\nway of life had gained him; he was happy only when in the midst of his\nresearches on the subjects for which he had a passion. It was matter for\nsurprise to many that this scientist, whose intellectual gifts had been\nspoiled by a too lively imagination, should have remained at Plassans,\nthis out-of-the-way town where it seemed as if every requirement for his\nstudies must be wanting. But he explained very well the advantages which\nhe had discovered here; in the first place, an utterly peaceful\nretreat in which he might live the secluded life he desired; then, an\nunsuspected field for continuous research in the light of the facts of\nheredity, which was his passion, in this little town where he knew every\nfamily and where he could follow the phenomena kept most secret, through\ntwo or three generations. And then he was near the seashore; he went\nthere almost every summer, to study the swarming life that is born\nand propagates itself in the depths of the vast waters. And there was\nfinally, at the hospital in Plassans, a dissecting room to which he was\nalmost the only visitor; a large, bright, quiet room, in which for more\nthan twenty years every unclaimed body had passed under his scalpel. A\nmodest man besides, of a timidity that had long since become shyness,\nit had been sufficient for him to maintain a correspondence with his old\nprofessors and his new friends, concerning the very remarkable papers\nwhich he from time to time sent to the Academy of Medicine. He was\naltogether wanting in militant ambition.\n\nAh, this heredity! what a subject of endless meditation it was for him!\nThe strangest, the most wonderful part of it all, was it not that\nthe resemblance between parents and children should not be perfect,\nmathematically exact? He had in the beginning made a genealogical tree\nof his family, logically traced, in which the influences from generation\nto generation were distributed equally--the father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part and the\nmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part. But the living reality contradicted the theory almost\nat every point. Heredity, instead of being resemblance, was an effort\ntoward resemblance thwarted by circumstances and environment. And he had\narrived at what he called the hypothesis of the abortion of cells. Life\nis only motion, and heredity being a communicated motion, it happened\nthat the cells in their multiplication from one another jostled one\nanother, pressed one another, made room for themselves, putting forth,\neach one, the hereditary effort; so that if during this struggle the\nweaker cells succumbed, considerable disturbances took place, with\nthe final result of organs totally different. Did not variation, the\nconstant invention of nature, which clashed with his theories, come from\nthis? Did not he himself differ from his parents only in consequence of\nsimilar accidents, or even as the effect of larvated heredity, in which\nhe had for a time believed? For every genealogical tree has roots which\nextend as far back into humanity as the first man; one cannot proceed\nfrom a single ancestor; one may always resemble a still older, unknown\nancestor. He doubted atavism, however; it seemed to him, in spite of a\nremarkable example taken from his own family, that resemblance at the\nend of two or three generations must disappear by reason of accidents,\nof interferences, of a thousand possible combinations. There was then\na perpetual becoming, a constant transformation in this communicated\neffort, this transmitted power, this shock which breathes into matter\nthe breath of life, and which is life itself. And a multiplicity\nof questions presented themselves to him. Was there a physical and\nintellectual progress through the ages? Did the brain grow with the\ngrowth of the sciences with which it occupied itself? Might one hope,\nin time, for a larger sum of reason and of happiness? Then there were\nspecial problems; one among others, the mystery of which had for a long\ntime irritated him, that of sex; would science never be able to predict,\nor at least to explain the sex of the embryo being? He had written a\nvery curious paper crammed full of facts on this subject, but which left\nit in the end in the complete ignorance in which the most exhaustive\nresearches had left it. Doubtless the question of heredity fascinated\nhim as it did only because it remained obscure, vast, and unfathomable,\nlike all the infant sciences where imagination holds sway. Finally, a\nlong study which he had made on the heredity of phthisis revived in him\nthe wavering faith of the healer, arousing in him the noble and wild\nhope of regenerating humanity.\n\nIn short, Dr. Pascal had only one belief--the belief in life. Life was\nthe only divine manifestation. Life was God, the grand motor, the\nsoul of the universe. And life had no other instrument than heredity;\nheredity made the world; so that if its laws could be known and\ndirected, the world could be made to one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s will. In him, to whom\nsickness, suffering, and death had been a familiar sight, the militant\npity of the physician awoke. Ah! to have no more sickness, no more\nsuffering, as little death as possible! His dream ended in this\nthought--that universal happiness, the future community of perfection\nand of felicity, could be hastened by intervention, by giving health to\nall. When all should be healthy, strong, and intelligent, there would\nbe only a superior race, infinitely wise and happy. In India, was not\na Brahmin developed from a Soudra in seven generations, thus raising,\nexperimentally, the lowest of beings to the highest type of humanity?\nAnd as in his study of consumption he had arrived at the conclusion that\nit was not hereditary, but that every child of a consumptive carried\nwithin him a degenerate soil in which consumption developed with\nextraordinary facility at the slightest contagion, he had come to think\nonly of invigorating this soil impoverished by heredity; to give it\nthe strength to resist the parasites, or rather the destructive leaven,\nwhich he had suspected to exist in the organism, long before the microbe\ntheory. To give strength--the whole problem was there; and to give\nstrength was also to give will, to enlarge the brain by fortifying the\nother organs.\n\nAbout this time the doctor, reading an old medical book of the fifteenth\ncentury, was greatly struck by a method of treating disease called\nsignature. To cure a diseased organ, it was only necessary to take from\na sheep or an ox the corresponding organ in sound condition, boil it,\nand give the soup to the patient to drink. The theory was to cure like\nby like, and in diseases of the liver, especially, the old work stated\nthat the cures were numberless. This set the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vivid imagination\nworking. Why not make the trial? If he wished to regenerate those\nenfeebled by hereditary influences, he had only to give them the normal\nand healthy nerve substance. The method of the soup, however, seemed to\nhim childish, and he invented in its stead that of grinding in a mortar\nthe brain of a sheep, moistening it with distilled water, and then\ndecanting and filtering the liquor thus obtained. He tried this liquor\nthen mixed with Malaga wine, on his patients, without obtaining any\nappreciable result. Suddenly, as he was beginning to grow discouraged,\nhe had an inspiration one day, when he was giving a lady suffering\nfrom hepatic colics an injection of morphine with the little syringe of\nPravaz. What if he were to try hypodermic injections with his liquor?\nAnd as soon as he returned home he tried the experiment on himself,\nmaking an injection in his side, which he repeated night and morning.\nThe first doses, of a gram only, were without effect. But having\ndoubled, and then tripled the dose, he was enchanted, one morning on\ngetting up, to find that his limbs had all the vigor of twenty. He went\non increasing the dose up to five grams, and then his respiration became\ndeeper, and above all he worked with a clearness of mind, an ease,\nwhich he had not known for years. A great flood of happiness, of joy in\nliving, inundated his being. From this time, after he had had a syringe\nmade at Paris capable of containing five grams, he was surprised at the\nhappy results which he obtained with his patients, whom he had on their\nfeet again in a few days, full of energy and activity, as if endowed\nwith new life. His method was still tentative and rude, and he divined\nin it all sorts of dangers, and especially, that of inducing embolism,\nif the liquor was not perfectly pure. Then he suspected that the\nstrength of his patients came in part from the fever his treatment\nproduced in them. But he was only a pioneer; the method would improve\nlater. Was it not already a miracle to make the ataxic walk, to bring\nconsumptives back to life, as it were; even to give hours of lucidity to\nthe insane? And at the thought of this discovery of the alchemy of the\ntwentieth century, an immense hope opened up before him; he believed he\nhad discovered the universal panacea, the elixir of life, which was\nto combat human debility, the one real cause of every ill; a veritable\nscientific Fountain of Youth, which, in giving vigor, health, and will\nwould create an altogether new and superior humanity.\n\nThis particular morning in his chamber, a room with a northern aspect\nand somewhat dark owing to the vicinity of the plane trees, furnished\nsimply with an iron bedstead, a mahogany writing desk, and a large\nwriting table, on which were a mortar and a microscope, he was\ncompleting with infinite care the preparation of a vial of his liquor.\nSince the day before, after pounding the nerve substance of a sheep in\ndistilled water, he had been decanting and filtering it. And he had\nat last obtained a small bottle of a turbid, opaline liquid, irised by\nbluish gleams, which he regarded for a long time in the light as if he\nheld in his hand the regenerating blood and symbol of the world.\n\nBut a few light knocks at the door and an urgent voice drew him from his\ndream.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, what is the matter, monsieur? It is a quarter-past twelve; don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nyou intend to come to breakfast?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor downstairs breakfast had been waiting for some time past in the\nlarge, cool dining-room. The blinds were closed, with the exception of\none which had just been half opened. It was a cheerful room, with pearl\ngray panels relieved by blue mouldings. The table, the sideboard, and\nthe chairs must have formed part of the set of Empire furniture in\nthe bedrooms; and the old mahogany, of a deep red, stood out in strong\nrelief against the light background. A hanging lamp of polished brass,\nalways shining, gleamed like a sun; while on the four walls bloomed four\nlarge bouquets in pastel, of gillyflowers, carnations, hyacinths, and\nroses.\n\nJoyous, radiant, Dr. Pascal entered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, the deuce! I had forgotten! I wanted to finish. Look at this, quite\nfresh, and perfectly pure this time; something to work miracles with!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he showed the vial, which he had brought down in his enthusiasm. But\nhis eye fell on Clotilde standing erect and silent, with a serious\nair. The secret vexation caused by waiting had brought back all her\nhostility, and she, who had burned to throw herself on his neck in the\nmorning, remained motionless as if chilled and repelled by him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he resumed, without losing anything of his gaiety, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe are still\nat odds, it seems. That is something very ugly. So you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t admire my\nsorcerer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s liquor, which resuscitates the dead?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe seated himself at the table, and the young girl, sitting down\nopposite him, was obliged at last to answer:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know well, master, that I admire everything belonging to you. Only,\nmy most ardent desire is that others also should admire you. And there\nis the death of poor old Boutin--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, without letting her finish, \u00e2\u0080\u009can epileptic, who succumbed\nto a congestive attack! See! since you are in a bad humor, let us talk\nno more about that--you would grieve me, and that would spoil my day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere were soft boiled eggs, cutlets, and cream. Silence reigned for a\nfew moments, during which in spite of her ill-humor she ate heartily,\nwith a good appetite which she had not the coquetry to conceal. Then he\nresumed, laughing:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat reassures me is to see that your stomach is in good order.\nMartine, hand mademoiselle the bread.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe servant waited on them as she was accustomed to do, watching them\neat, with her quiet air of familiarity.\n\nSometimes she even chatted with them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMonsieur,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, when she had cut the bread, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe butcher has\nbrought his bill. Is he to be paid?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked up at her in surprise.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy do you ask me that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you not always pay him without\nconsulting me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was, in effect, Martine who kept the purse. The amount deposited\nwith M. Grandguillot, notary at Plassans, produced a round sum of six\nthousand francs income. Every three months the fifteen hundred francs\nwere remitted to the servant, and she disposed of them to the best\ninterests of the house; bought and paid for everything with the\nstrictest economy, for she was of so saving a disposition that they\nbantered her about it continually. Clotilde, who spent very little, had\nnever thought of asking a separate purse for herself. As for the doctor,\nhe took what he required for his experiments and his pocket money from\nthe three or four thousand francs which he still earned every year, and\nwhich he kept lying in the drawer of his writing desk; so that there was\nquite a little treasure there in gold and bank bills, of which he never\nknew the exact amount.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUndoubtedly, monsieur, I pay, when it is I who have bought the things;\nbut this time the bill is so large on account of the brains which the\nbutcher has furnished you--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe doctor interrupted her brusquely:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, come! so you, too, are going to set yourself against me, are you?\nNo, no; both of you--that would be too much! Yesterday you pained me\ngreatly, and I was angry. But this must cease. I will not have the house\nturned into a hell. Two women against me, and they the only ones who\nlove me at all? Do you know, I would sooner quit the house at once!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe did not speak angrily, he even smiled; but the disquietude of his\nheart was perceptible in the trembling of his voice. And he added with\nhis indulgent, cheerful air:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you are afraid for the end of the month, my girl, tell the butcher\nto send my bill apart. And don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fear; you are not going to be asked for\nany of your money to settle it with; your sous may lie sleeping.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was an allusion to Martine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little personal fortune. In thirty\nyears, with four hundred francs wages she had earned twelve thousand\nfrancs, from which she had taken only what was strictly necessary for\nher wants; and increased, almost trebled, by the interest, her savings\namounted now to thirty thousand francs, which through a caprice, a\ndesire to have her money apart, she had not chosen to place with M.\nGrandguillot. They were elsewhere, safely invested in the funds.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSous that lie sleeping are honest sous,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said gravely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut\nmonsieur is right; I will tell the butcher to send a bill apart, as all\nthe brains are for monsieur\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cookery and not for mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis explanation brought a smile to the face of Clotilde, who was always\namused by the jests about Martine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s avarice; and the breakfast ended\nmore cheerfully. The doctor desired to take the coffee under the plane\ntrees, saying that he felt the need of air after being shut up all\nthe morning. The coffee was served then on the stone table beside the\nfountain; and how pleasant it was there in the shade, listening to the\ncool murmur of the water, while around, the pine wood, the court, the\nwhole place, were glowing in the early afternoon sun.\n\nThe doctor had complacently brought with him the vial of nerve\nsubstance, which he looked at as it stood on the table.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, then, mademoiselle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he resumed, with an air of brusque pleasantry,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cyou do not believe in my elixir of resurrection, and you believe in\nmiracles!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster,\u00e2\u0080\u009d responded Clotilde, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe that we do not know\neverything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe made a gesture of impatience.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we must know everything. Understand then, obstinate little girl,\nthat not a single deviation from the invariable laws which govern the\nuniverse has ever been scientifically proved. Up to this day there has\nbeen no proof of the existence of any intelligence other than the human.\nI defy you to find any real will, any reasoning force, outside of life.\nAnd everything is there; there is in the world no other will than\nthis force which impels everything to life, to a life ever broader and\nhigher.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe rose with a wave of the hand, animated by so firm a faith that she\nregarded him in surprise, noticing how youthful he looked in spite of\nhis white hair.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you wish me to repeat my \u00e2\u0080\u0098Credo\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for you, since you accuse me of not\nwanting yours? I believe that the future of humanity is in the progress\nof reason through science. I believe that the pursuit of truth, through\nscience, is the divine ideal which man should propose to himself. I\nbelieve that all is illusion and vanity outside the treasure of truths\nslowly accumulated, and which will never again be lost. I believe that\nthe sum of these truths, always increasing, will at last confer on man\nincalculable power and peace, if not happiness. Yes, I believe in the\nfinal triumph of life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd with a broader sweep of the hand that took in the vast horizon, as\nif calling on these burning plains in which fermented the saps of all\nexistences to bear him witness, he added:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the continual miracle, my child, is life. Only open your eyes, and\nlook.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is in vain that I open my eyes; I cannot see everything. It is you,\nmaster, who are blind, since you do not wish to admit that there is\nbeyond an unknown realm which you will never enter. Oh, I know you are\ntoo intelligent to be ignorant of that! Only you do not wish to take it\ninto account; you put the unknown aside, because it would embarrass\nyou in your researches. It is in vain that you tell me to put aside the\nmysterious; to start from the known for the conquest of the unknown. I\ncannot; the mysterious at once calls me back and disturbs me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe listened to her, smiling, glad to see her become animated, while he\nsmoothed her fair curls with his hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes, I know you are like the rest; you do not wish to live without\nillusions and without lies. Well, there, there; we understand each other\nstill, even so. Keep well; that is the half of wisdom and of happiness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, changing the conversation:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, you will accompany me, notwithstanding, and help me in my round\nof miracles. This is Thursday, my visiting day. When the heat shall have\nabated a little, we will go out together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe refused at first, in order not to seem to yield; but she at last\nconsented, seeing the pain she gave him. She was accustomed to accompany\nhim on his round of visits. They remained for some time longer under the\nplane trees, until the doctor went upstairs to dress. When he came\ndown again, correctly attired in a close-fitting coat and wearing a\nbroad-brimmed silk hat, he spoke of harnessing Bonhomme, the horse\nthat for a quarter of a century had taken him on his visits through the\nstreets and the environs of Plassans. But the poor old beast was growing\nblind, and through gratitude for his past services and affection for\nhimself they now rarely disturbed him. On this afternoon he was very\ndrowsy, his gaze wandered, his legs were stiff with rheumatism. So that\nthe doctor and the young girl, when they went to the stable to see him,\ngave him a hearty kiss on either side of his nose, telling him to rest\non a bundle of fresh hay which the servant had brought. And they decided\nto walk.\n\nClotilde, keeping on her spotted white muslin, merely tied on over her\ncurls a large straw hat adorned with a bunch of lilacs; and she looked\ncharming, with her large eyes and her complexion of milk-and-roses under\nthe shadow of its broad brim. When she went out thus on Pascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm,\nshe tall, slender, and youthful, he radiant, his face illuminated, so\nto say, by the whiteness of his beard, with a vigor that made him still\nlift her across the rivulets, people smiled as they passed, and turned\naround to look at them again, they seemed so innocent and so happy. On\nthis day, as they left the road to Les Fenouilleres to enter Plassans, a\ngroup of gossips stopped short in their talk. It reminded one of one\nof those ancient kings one sees in pictures; one of those powerful and\ngentle kings who never grew old, resting his hand on the shoulder of a\ngirl beautiful as the day, whose docile and dazzling youth lends him its\nsupport.\n\nThey were turning into the Cours Sauvair to gain the Rue de la Banne,\nwhen a tall, dark young man of about thirty stopped them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, master, you have forgotten me. I am still waiting for your notes on\nconsumption.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was Dr. Ramond, a young physician, who had settled two years before\nat Plassans, where he was building up a fine practise. With a superb\nhead, in the brilliant prime of a gracious manhood, he was adored by\nthe women, but he had fortunately a great deal of good sense and a great\ndeal of prudence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Ramond, good day! Not at all, my dear friend; I have not forgotten\nyou. It is this little girl, to whom I gave the notes yesterday to copy,\nand who has not touched them yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe two young people shook hands with an air of cordial intimacy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood day, Mlle. Clotilde.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood day, M. Ramond.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDuring a gastric fever, happily mild, which the young girl had had\nthe preceding year, Dr. Pascal had lost his head to the extent of\ndistrusting his own skill, and he had asked his young colleague to\nassist him--to reassure him. Thus it was that an intimacy, a sort of\ncomradeship, had sprung up among the three.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall have your notes to-morrow, I promise you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, smiling.\n\nRamond walked on with them, however, until they reached the end of the\nRue de la Banne, at the entrance of the old quarter whither they were\ngoing. And there was in the manner in which he leaned, smiling, toward\nClotilde, the revelation of a secret love that had grown slowly,\nawaiting patiently the hour fixed for the most reasonable of\n_denouements_. Besides, he listened with deference to Dr. Pascal, whose\nworks he admired greatly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it just happens, my dear friend, that I am going to Guiraude\u00e2\u0080\u0099s,\nthat woman, you know, whose husband, a tanner, died of consumption five\nyears ago. She has two children living--Sophie, a girl now going on\nsixteen, whom I fortunately succeeded in having sent four years before\nher father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death to a neighboring village, to one of her aunts; and\na son, Valentin, who has just completed his twenty-first year, and\nwhom his mother insisted on keeping with her through a blind affection,\nnotwithstanding that I warned her of the dreadful results that might\nensue. Well, see if I am right in asserting that consumption is not\nhereditary, but only that consumptive parents transmit to their children\na degenerate soil, in which the disease develops at the slightest\ncontagion. Now, Valentin, who lived in daily contact with his father,\nis consumptive, while Sophie, who grew up in the open air, has superb\nhealth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe added with a triumphant smile:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut that will not prevent me, perhaps, from saving Valentin, for he\nis visibly improved, and is growing fat since I have used my injections\nwith him. Ah, Ramond, you will come to them yet; you will come to my\ninjections!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young physician shook hands with both of them, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say no. You know that I am always with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen they were alone they quickened their steps and were soon in the Rue\nCanquoin, one of the narrowest and darkest streets of the old quarter.\nHot as was the sun, there reigned here the semi-obscurity and the\ncoolness of a cave. Here it was, on a ground floor, that Guiraude lived\nwith her son Valentin. She opened the door herself. She was a thin,\nwasted-looking woman, who was herself affected with a slow decomposition\nof the blood. From morning till night she crushed almonds with the end\nof an ox-bone on a large paving stone, which she held between her knees.\nThis work was their only means of living, the son having been obliged to\ngive up all labor. She smiled, however, to-day on seeing the doctor, for\nValentin had just eaten a cutlet with a good appetite, a thing which\nhe had not done for months. Valentin, a sickly-looking young man, with\nscanty hair and beard and prominent cheek bones, on each of which was\na bright red spot, while the rest of his face was of a waxen hue,\nrose quickly to show how much more sprightly he felt! And Clotilde\nwas touched by the reception given to Pascal as a saviour, the awaited\nMessiah. These poor people pressed his hands--they would like to have\nkissed his feet; looking at him with eyes shining with gratitude. True,\nthe disease was not yet cured: perhaps this was only the effect of the\nstimulus, perhaps what he felt was only the excitement of fever. But\nwas it not something to gain time? He gave him another injection while\nClotilde, standing before the window, turned her back to them; and when\nthey were leaving she saw him lay twenty francs upon the table. This\noften happened to him, to pay his patients instead of being paid by\nthem.\n\nHe made three other visits in the old quarter, and then went to see a\nlady in the new town. When they found themselves in the street again, he\nsaid:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know that, if you were a courageous girl, we should walk to\nSeguiranne, to see Sophie at her aunt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. That would give me pleasure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe distance was scarcely three kilometers; that would be only a\npleasant walk in this delightful weather. And she agreed gaily, not\nsulky now, but pressing close to him, happy to hang on his arm. It was\nfive o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock. The setting sun spread over the fields a great sheet of\ngold. But as soon as they left Plassans they were obliged to cross\nthe corner of the vast, arid plain, which extended to the right of the\nViorne. The new canal, whose irrigating waters were soon to transform\nthe face of the country parched with thirst, did not yet water this\nquarter, and red fields and yellow fields stretched away into the\ndistance under the melancholy and blighting glare of the sun, planted\nonly with puny almond trees and dwarf olives, constantly cut down and\npruned, whose branches twisted and writhed in attitudes of suffering\nand revolt. In the distance, on the bare hillsides, were to be seen only\nlike pale patches the country houses, flanked by the regulation cypress.\nThe vast, barren expanse, however, with broad belts of desolate fields\nof hard and distinct coloring, had classic lines of a severe grandeur.\nAnd on the road the dust lay twenty centimeters thick, a dust like snow,\nthat the slightest breath of wind raised in broad, flying clouds, and\nthat covered with white powder the fig trees and the brambles on either\nside.\n\nClotilde, who amused herself like a child, listening to this dust\ncrackling under her little feet, wished to hold her parasol over Pascal.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have the sun in your eyes. Lean a little this way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut at last he took possession of the parasol, to hold it himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is you who do not hold it right; and then it tires you. Besides, we\nare almost there now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn the parched plain they could already perceive an island of verdure,\nan enormous clump of trees. This was La Seguiranne, the farm on which\nSophie had grown up in the house of her Aunt Dieudonne, the wife of\nthe cross old man. Wherever there was a spring, wherever there was a\nrivulet, this ardent soil broke out in rich vegetation; and then\nthere were walks bordered by trees, whose luxuriant foliage afforded a\ndelightful coolness and shade. Plane trees, chestnut trees, and young\nelms grew vigorously. They entered an avenue of magnificent green oaks.\n\nAs they approached the farm, a girl who was making hay in the meadow\ndropped her fork and ran toward them. It was Sophie, who had recognized\nthe doctor and the young lady, as she called Clotilde. She adored them,\nbut she stood looking at them in confusion, unable to express the glad\ngreeting with which her heart overflowed. She resembled her brother\nValentin; she had his small stature, his prominent cheek bones, his\npale hair; but in the country, far from the contagion of the paternal\nenvironment, she had, it seemed, gained flesh; acquired with her\nrobust limbs a firm step; her cheeks had filled out, her hair had grown\nluxuriant. And she had fine eyes, which shone with health and gratitude.\nHer Aunt Dieudonne, who was making hay with her, had come toward them\nalso, crying from afar jestingly, with something of Provencal rudeness:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, M. Pascal, we have no need of you here! There is no one sick!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe doctor, who had simply come in search of this fine spectacle of\nhealth, answered in the same tone:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope so, indeed. But that does not prevent this little girl here from\nowing you and me a fine taper!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, that is the pure truth! And she knows it, M. Pascal. There is not\na day that she does not say that but for you she would be at this time\nlike her brother Valentin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBah! We will save him, too. He is getting better, Valentin is. I have\njust been to see him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSophie seized the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands; large tears stood in her eyes, and she\ncould only stammer:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, M. Pascal!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHow they loved him! And Clotilde felt her affection for him increase,\nseeing the affection of all these people for him. They remained chatting\nthere for a few moments longer, in the salubrious shade of the green\noaks. Then they took the road back to Plassans, having still another\nvisit to make.\n\nThis was to a tavern, that stood at the crossing of two roads and was\nwhite with the flying dust. A steam mill had recently been established\nopposite, utilizing the old buildings of Le Paradou, an estate dating\nfrom the last century, and Lafouasse, the tavern keeper, still carried\non his little business, thanks to the workmen at the mill and to the\npeasants who brought their corn to it. He had still for customers on\nSundays the few inhabitants of Les Artauds, a neighboring hamlet. But\nmisfortune had struck him; for the last three years he had been dragging\nhimself about groaning with rheumatism, in which the doctor had finally\nrecognized the beginning of ataxia. But he had obstinately refused to\ntake a servant, persisting in waiting on his customers himself, holding\non by the furniture. So that once more firm on his feet, after a dozen\npunctures, he already proclaimed his cure everywhere.\n\nHe chanced to be just then at his door, and looked strong and vigorous,\nwith his tall figure, fiery face, and fiery red hair.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was waiting for you, M. Pascal. Do you know that I have been able to\nbottle two casks of wine without being tired!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde remained outside, sitting on a stone bench; while Pascal\nentered the room to give Lafouasse the injection. She could hear\nthem speaking, and the latter, who in spite of his stoutness was very\ncowardly in regard to pain, complained that the puncture hurt, adding,\nhowever, that after all a little suffering was a small price to pay for\ngood health. Then he declared he would be offended if the doctor did\nnot take a glass of something. The young lady would not affront him by\nrefusing to take some syrup. He carried a table outside, and there was\nnothing for it but they must touch glasses with him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo your health, M. Pascal, and to the health of all the poor devils to\nwhom you give back a relish for their victuals!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde thought with a smile of the gossip of which Martine had spoken\nto her, of Father Boutin, whom they accused the doctor of having killed.\nHe did not kill all his patients, then; his remedy worked real miracles,\nsince he brought back to life the consumptive and the ataxic. And her\nfaith in her master returned with the warm affection for him which\nwelled up in her heart. When they left Lafouasse, she was once more\ncompletely his; he could do what he willed with her.\n\nBut a few moments before, sitting on the stone bench looking at the\nsteam mill, a confused story had recurred to her mind; was it not here\nin these smoke-blackened buildings, to-day white with flour, that a\ndrama of love had once been enacted? And the story came back to her;\ndetails given by Martine; allusions made by the doctor himself; the\nwhole tragic love adventure of her cousin the Abbe Serge Mouret,\nthen rector of Les Artauds, with an adorable young girl of a wild and\npassionate nature who lived at Le Paradou.\n\nReturning by the same road Clotilde stopped, and pointing to the vast,\nmelancholy expanse of stubble fields, cultivated plains, and fallow\nland, said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster, was there not once there a large garden? Did you not tell me\nsome story about it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes; Le Paradou, an immense garden--woods, meadows, orchards,\nparterres, fountains, and brooks that flowed into the Viorne. A garden\nabandoned for an age; the garden of the Sleeping Beauty, returned to\nNature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rule. And as you see they have cut down the woods, and cleared\nand leveled the ground, to divide it into lots, and sell it by auction.\nThe springs themselves have dried up. There is nothing there now but\nthat fever-breeding marsh. Ah, when I pass by here, it makes my heart\nache!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe ventured to question him further:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut was it not in Le Paradou that my cousin Serge and your great friend\nAlbine fell in love with each other?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe had forgotten her presence. He went on talking, his gaze fixed on\nspace, lost in recollections of the past.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlbine, my God! I can see her now, in the sunny garden, like a great,\nfragrant bouquet, her head thrown back, her bosom swelling with joy,\nhappy in her flowers, with wild flowers braided among her blond tresses,\nfastened at her throat, on her corsage, around her slender, bare brown\narms. And I can see her again, after she had asphyxiated herself; dead\nin the midst of her flowers; very white, sleeping with folded hands, and\na smile on her lips, on her couch of hyacinths and tuberoses. Dead for\nlove; and how passionately Albine and Serge loved each other, in the\ngreat garden their tempter, in the bosom of Nature their accomplice! And\nwhat a flood of life swept away all false bonds, and what a triumph of\nlife!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde, she too troubled by this passionate flow of murmured words,\ngazed at him intently. She had never ventured to speak to him of another\nstory that she had heard--the story of the one love of his life--a love\nwhich he had cherished in secret for a lady now dead. It was said that\nhe had attended her for a long time without ever so much as venturing to\nkiss the tips of her fingers. Up to the present, up to near sixty, study\nand his natural timidity had made him shun women. But, notwithstanding,\none felt that he was reserved for some great passion, with his feelings\nstill fresh and ardent, in spite of his white hair.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the girl that died, the girl they mourned,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she resumed, her voice\ntrembling, her cheeks scarlet, without knowing why. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSerge did not love\nher, then, since he let her die?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal started as though awakening from a dream, seeing her beside him\nin her youthful beauty, with her large, clear eyes shining under the\nshadow of her broad-brimmed hat. Something had happened; the same breath\nof life had passed through them both; they did not take each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\narms again. They walked side by side.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, my dear, the world would be too beautiful, if men did not spoil it\nall! Albine is dead, and Serge is now rector of St. Eutrope, where\nhe lives with his sister Desiree, a worthy creature who has the good\nfortune to be half an idiot. He is a holy man; I have never said the\ncontrary. One may be an assassin and serve God.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he went on speaking of the hard things of life, of the blackness\nand execrableness of humanity, without losing his gentle smile. He loved\nlife; and the continuous work of life was a continual joy to him\nin spite of all the evil, all the misery, that it might contain. It\nmattered not how dreadful life might appear, it must be great and good,\nsince it was lived with so tenacious a will, for the purpose no doubt\nof this will itself, and of the great work which it unconsciously\naccomplished. True, he was a scientist, a clear-sighted man; he did not\nbelieve in any idyllic humanity living in a world of perpetual peace; he\nsaw, on the contrary, its woes and its vices; he had laid them bare; he\nhad examined them; he had catalogued them for thirty years past, but\nhis passion for life, his admiration for the forces of life, sufficed to\nproduce in him a perpetual gaiety, whence seemed to flow naturally his\nlove for others, a fraternal compassion, a sympathy, which were\nfelt under the roughness of the anatomist and under the affected\nimpersonality of his studies.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he ended, taking a last glance at the vast, melancholy plains.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLe Paradou is no more. They have sacked it, defiled it, destroyed it;\nbut what does that matter! Vines will be planted, corn will spring up,\na whole growth of new crops; and people will still fall in love in\nvintages and harvests yet to come. Life is eternal; it is a perpetual\nrenewal of birth and growth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe took her arm again and they returned to the town thus, arm in arm\nlike good friends, while the glow of the sunset was slowly fading away\nin a tranquil sea of violets and roses. And seeing them both pass again,\nthe ancient king, powerful and gentle, leaning against the shoulder of\na charming and docile girl, supported by her youth, the women of the\nfaubourg, sitting at their doors, looked after them with a smile of\ntender emotion.\n\nAt La Souleiade Martine was watching for them. She waved her hand to\nthem from afar. What! Were they not going to dine to-day? Then, when\nthey were near, she said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! you will have to wait a little while. I did not venture to put on\nmy leg of mutton yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey remained outside to enjoy the charm of the closing day. The pine\ngrove, wrapped in shadow, exhaled a balsamic resinous odor, and from\nthe yard, still heated, in which a last red gleam was dying away, a\nchillness arose. It was like an assuagement, a sigh of relief, a resting\nof surrounding Nature, of the puny almond trees, the twisted olives,\nunder the paling sky, cloudless and serene; while at the back of the\nhouse the clump of plane trees was a mass of black and impenetrable\nshadows, where the fountain was heard singing its eternal crystal song.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cM. Bellombre has already dined, and he is\ntaking the air.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe pointed to a bench, on which a tall, thin old man of seventy was\nsitting, with a long face, furrowed with wrinkles, and large, staring\neyes, and very correctly attired in a close-fitting coat and cravat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is a wise man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d murmured Clotilde. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is happy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Pascal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should hope not!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe hated no one, and M. Bellombre, the old college professor, now\nretired, and living in his little house without any other company than\nthat of a gardener who was deaf and dumb and older than himself, was the\nonly person who had the power to exasperate him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA fellow who has been afraid of life; think of that! afraid of life!\nYes, a hard and avaricious egotist! If he banished woman from his\nexistence, it was only through fear of having to pay for her shoes.\nAnd he has known only the children of others, who have made him\nsuffer--hence his hatred of the child--that flesh made to be flogged.\nThe fear of life, the fear of burdens and of duties, of annoyances and\nof catastrophes! The fear of life, which makes us through dread of its\nsufferings refuse its joys. Ah! I tell you, this cowardliness enrages\nme; I cannot forgive it. We must live--live a complete life--live\nall our life. Better even suffering, suffering only, than such\nrenunciation--the death of all there is in us that is living and human!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nM. Bellombre had risen, and was walking along one of the walks with\nslow, tranquil steps. Then, Clotilde, who had been watching him in\nsilence, at last said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is, however, the joy of renunciation. To renounce, not to live;\nto keep one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self for the spiritual, has not this always been the great\nhappiness of the saints?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf they had not lived,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Pascal, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey could not now be saints.\nLet suffering come, and I will bless it, for it is perhaps the only\ngreat happiness!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut he felt that she rebelled against this; that he was going to lose\nher again. At the bottom of our anxiety about the beyond is the secret\nfear and hatred of life. So that he hastily assumed again his pleasant\nsmile, so affectionate and conciliating.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no! Enough for to-day; let us dispute no more; let us love each\nother dearly. And see! Martine is calling us, let us go in to dinner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nFor a month this unpleasant state of affairs continued, every day\ngrowing worse, and Clotilde suffered especially at seeing that Pascal\nnow locked up everything. He had no longer the same tranquil confidence\nin her as before, and this wounded her so deeply that, if she had at\nany time found the press open, she would have thrown the papers into\nthe fire as her grandmother Felicite had urged her to do. And the\ndisagreements began again, so that they often remained without speaking\nto each other for two days together.\n\nOne morning, after one of these misunderstandings which had lasted since\nthe day before, Martine said as she was serving the breakfast:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust now as I was crossing the Place de la Sous-Prefecture, I saw a\nstranger whom I thought I recognized going into Mme. Felicite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house.\nYes, mademoiselle, I should not be surprised if it were your brother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOn the impulse of the moment, Pascal and Clotilde spoke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour brother! Did your grandmother expect him, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think so, though she has been expecting him at any time for\nthe past six months, I know that she wrote to him again a week ago.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey questioned Martine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed, monsieur, I cannot say; since I last saw M. Maxime four years\nago, when he stayed two hours with us on his way to Italy, he may\nperhaps have changed greatly--I thought, however, that I recognized his\nback.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe conversation continued, Clotilde seeming to be glad of this event,\nwhich broke at last the oppressive silence between them, and Pascal\nended:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, if it is he, he will come to see us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was indeed Maxime. He had yielded, after months of refusal, to the\nurgent solicitations of old Mme. Rougon, who had still in this quarter\nan open family wound to heal. The trouble was an old one, and it grew\nworse every day.\n\nFifteen years before, when he was seventeen, Maxime had had a child by\na servant whom he had seduced. His father Saccard, and his stepmother\nRenee--the latter vexed more especially at his unworthy choice--had\nacted in the matter with indulgence. The servant, Justine Megot,\nbelonged to one of the neighboring villages, and was a fair-haired\ngirl, also seventeen, gentle and docile; and they had sent her back to\nPlassans, with an allowance of twelve hundred francs a year, to bring up\nlittle Charles. Three years later she had married there a harness-maker\nof the faubourg, Frederic Thomas by name, a good workman and a sensible\nfellow, who was tempted by the allowance. For the rest her conduct was\nnow most exemplary, she had grown fat, and she appeared to be cured of\na cough that had threatened a hereditary malady due to the alcoholic\npropensities of a long line of progenitors. And two other children born\nof her marriage, a boy who was now ten and a girl who was seven, both\nplump and rosy, enjoyed perfect health; so that she would have been the\nmost respected and the happiest of women, if it had not been for the\ntrouble which Charles caused in the household. Thomas, notwithstanding\nthe allowance, execrated this son of another man and gave him no peace,\nwhich made the mother suffer in secret, being an uncomplaining and\nsubmissive wife. So that, although she adored him, she would willingly\nhave given him up to his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family.\n\nCharles, at fifteen, seemed scarcely twelve, and he had the infantine\nintelligence of a child of five, resembling in an extraordinary degree\nhis great-great-grandmother, Aunt Dide, the madwoman at the Tulettes.\nHe had the slender and delicate grace of one of those bloodless little\nkings with whom a race ends, crowned with their long, fair locks, light\nas spun silk. His large, clear eyes were expressionless, and on his\ndisquieting beauty lay the shadow of death. And he had neither brain\nnor heart--he was nothing but a vicious little dog, who rubbed himself\nagainst people to be fondled. His great-grandmother Felicite, won by\nthis beauty, in which she affected to recognize her blood, had at first\nput him in a boarding school, taking charge of him, but he had been\nexpelled from it at the end of six months for misconduct. Three times\nshe had changed his boarding school, and each time he had been expelled\nin disgrace. Then, as he neither would nor could learn anything, and\nas his health was declining rapidly, they kept him at home, sending him\nfrom one to another of the family. Dr. Pascal, moved to pity, had tried\nto cure him, and had abandoned the hopeless task only after he had kept\nhim with him for nearly a year, fearing the companionship for Clotilde.\nAnd now, when Charles was not at his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, where he scarcely ever\nlived at present, he was to be found at the house of Felicite, or that\nof some other relative, prettily dressed, laden with toys, living like\nthe effeminate little dauphin of an ancient and fallen race.\n\nOld Mme. Rougon, however, suffered because of this bastard, and she\nhad planned to get him away from the gossiping tongues of Plassans, by\npersuading Maxime to take him and keep him with him in Paris. It would\nstill be an ugly story of the fallen family. But Maxime had for a\nlong time turned a deaf ear to her solicitations, in the fear which\ncontinually haunted him of spoiling his life. After the war, enriched by\nthe death of his wife, he had come back to live prudently on his fortune\nin his mansion on the avenue of the Bois de Boulogne, tormented by the\nhereditary malady of which he was to die young, having gained from his\nprecocious debauchery a salutary fear of pleasure, resolved above all\nto shun emotions and responsibilities, so that he might last as long as\npossible. Acute pains in the limbs, rheumatic he thought them, had been\nalarming him for some time past; he saw himself in fancy already an\ninvalid tied down to an easy-chair; and his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sudden return to\nFrance, the fresh activity which Saccard was putting forth, completed\nhis disquietude. He knew well this devourer of millions; he trembled at\nfinding him again bustling about him with his good-humored, malicious\nlaugh. He felt that he was being watched, and he had the conviction that\nhe would be cut up and devoured if he should be for a single day at his\nmercy, rendered helpless by the pains which were invading his limbs. And\nso great a fear of solitude had taken possession of him that he had now\nyielded to the idea of seeing his son again. If he found the boy gentle,\nintelligent, and healthy, why should he not take him to live with him?\nHe would thus have a companion, an heir, who would protect him against\nthe machinations of his father. Gradually he came to see himself, in his\nselfish forethought, loved, petted, and protected; yet for all that he\nmight not have risked such a journey, if his physician had not just at\nthat time sent him to the waters of St. Gervais. Thus, having to go\nonly a few leagues out of his way, he had dropped in unexpectedly that\nmorning on old Mme. Rougon, firmly resolved to take the train again in\nthe evening, after having questioned her and seen the boy.\n\nAt two o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock Pascal and Clotilde were still beside the fountain under\nthe plane trees where they had taken their coffee, when Felicite arrived\nwith Maxime.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a surprise! I have brought you your brother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nStartled, the young girl had risen, seeing this thin and sallow\nstranger, whom she scarcely recognized. Since their parting in 1854 she\nhad seen him only twice, once at Paris and again at Plassans. Yet his\nimage, refined, elegant, and vivacious, had remained engraven on her\nmind; his face had grown hollow, his hair was streaked with silver\nthreads. But notwithstanding, she found in him still, with his\ndelicately handsome head, a languid grace, like that of a girl, even in\nhis premature decrepitude.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow well you look!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said simply, as he embraced his sister.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she responded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto be well one must live in the sunshine. Ah, how\nhappy it makes me to see you again!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal, with the eye of the physician, had examined his nephew\ncritically. He embraced him in his turn.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGoodday, my boy. And she is right, mind you; one can be well only out\nin the sunshine--like the trees.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite had gone hastily to the house. She returned, crying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCharles is not here, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Clotilde. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe went to see him yesterday. Uncle Macquart has\ntaken him, and he is to remain for a few days at the Tulettes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite was in despair. She had come only in the certainty of finding\nthe boy at Pascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. What was to be done now? The doctor, with his\ntranquil air, proposed to write to Uncle Macquart, who would bring him\nback in the morning. But when he learned that Maxime wished positively\nto go away again by the nine o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock train, without remaining over\nnight, another idea occurred to him. He would send to the livery stable\nfor a landau, and all four would go to see Charles at Uncle Macquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\nIt would even be a delightful drive. It was not quite three leagues from\nPlassans to the Tulettes--an hour to go, and an hour to return, and they\nwould still have almost two hours to remain there, if they wished to\nbe back by seven. Martine would get dinner, and Maxime would have time\nenough to dine and catch his train.\n\nBut Felicite objected, visibly disquieted by this visit to Macquart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no, indeed! If you think I am going down there in this frightful\nweather, you are mistaken. It is much simpler to send some one to bring\nCharles to us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal shook his head. Charles was not always to be brought back when\none wished. He was a boy without reason, who sometimes, if the whim\nseized him, would gallop off like an untamed animal. And old Mme.\nRougon, overruled and furious at having been unable to make any\npreparation, was at last obliged to yield, in the necessity in which she\nfound herself of leaving the matter to chance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, be it as you wish, then! Good Heavens, how unfortunately things\nhave turned out!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMartine hurried away to order the landau, and before three o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock had\nstruck the horses were on the Nice road, descending the declivity which\nslopes down to the bridge over the Viorne. Then they turned to the left,\nand followed the wooded banks of the river for about two miles. After\nthis the road entered the gorges of the Seille, a narrow pass between\ntwo giant walls of rock scorched by the ardent rays of the summer\nsun. Pine trees pushed their way through the clefts; clumps of trees,\nscarcely thicker at the roots than tufts of grass, fringed the crests\nand hung over the abyss. It was a chaos; a blasted landscape, a mouth of\nhell, with its wild turns, its droppings of blood-colored earth sliding\ndown from every cut, its desolate solitude invaded only by the eagles\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nflight.\n\nFelicite did not open her lips; her brain was at work, and she seemed\ncompletely absorbed in her thoughts. The atmosphere was oppressive,\nthe sun sent his burning rays from behind a veil of great livid clouds.\nPascal was almost the only one who talked, in his passionate love for\nthis scorched land--a love which he endeavored to make his nephew share.\nBut it was in vain that he uttered enthusiastic exclamations, in vain\nthat he called his attention to the persistence of the olives, the fig\ntrees, and the thorn bushes in pushing through the rock; the life of the\nrock itself, that colossal and puissant frame of the earth, from which\nthey could almost fancy they heard a sound of breathing arise. Maxime\nremained cold, filled with a secret anguish in presence of those blocks\nof savage majesty, whose mass seemed to crush him. And he preferred to\nturn his eyes toward his sister, who was seated in front of him. He was\nbecoming more and more charmed with her. She looked so healthy and\nso happy, with her pretty round head, with its straight, well-molded\nforehead. Now and then their glances met, and she gave him an\naffectionate smile which consoled him.\n\nBut the wildness of the gorge was beginning to soften, the two walls of\nrock to grow lower; they passed between two peaceful hills, with gentle\nslopes covered with thyme and lavender. It was the desert still, there\nwere still bare spaces, green or violet hued, from which the faintest\nbreeze brought a pungent perfume.\n\nThen abruptly, after a last turn they descended to the valley of the\nTulettes, which was refreshed by springs. In the distance stretched\nmeadows dotted by large trees. The village was seated midway on the\nslope, among olive trees, and the country house of Uncle Macquart stood\na little apart on the left, full in view. The landau turned into the\nroad which led to the insane asylum, whose white walls they could see\nbefore them in the distance.\n\nFelicite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s silence had grown somber, for she was not fond of exhibiting\nUncle Macquart. Another whom the family would be well rid of the day\nwhen he should take his departure. For the credit of every one he\nought to have been sleeping long ago under the sod. But he persisted\nin living, he carried his eighty-three years well, like an old drunkard\nsaturated with liquor, whom the alcohol seemed to preserve. At Plassans\nhe had left a terrible reputation as a do-nothing and a scoundrel,\nand the old men whispered the execrable story of the corpses that lay\nbetween him and the Rougons, an act of treachery in the troublous days\nof December, 1851, an ambuscade in which he had left comrades with their\nbellies ripped open, lying on the bloody pavement. Later, when he had\nreturned to France, he had preferred to the good place of which he had\nobtained the promise this little domain of the Tulettes, which Felicite\nhad bought for him. And he had lived comfortably here ever since; he had\nno longer any other ambition than that of enlarging it, looking out once\nmore for the good chances, and he had even found the means of obtaining\na field which he had long coveted, by making himself useful to his\nsister-in-law at the time when the latter again reconquered Plassans\nfrom the legitimists--another frightful story that was whispered also,\nof a madman secretly let loose from the asylum, running in the night\nto avenge himself, setting fire to his house in which four persons were\nburned. But these were old stories and Macquart, settled down now, was\nno longer the redoubtable scoundrel who had made all the family tremble.\nHe led a perfectly correct life; he was a wily diplomat, and he had\nretained nothing of his air of jeering at the world but his bantering\nsmile.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUncle is at home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Pascal, as they approached the house.\n\nThis was one of those Provencal structures of a single story, with\ndiscolored tiles and four walls washed with a bright yellow. Before the\nfacade extended a narrow terrace shaded by ancient mulberry trees, whose\nthick, gnarled branches drooped down, forming an arbor. It was here\nthat Uncle Macquart smoked his pipe in the cool shade, in summer. And on\nhearing the sound of the carriage, he came and stood at the edge of the\nterrace, straightening his tall form neatly clad in blue cloth, his head\ncovered with the eternal fur cap which he wore from one year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end to\nthe other.\n\nAs soon as he recognized his visitors, he called out with a sneer:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, here come some fine company! How kind of you; you are out for an\nairing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the presence of Maxime puzzled him. Who was he? Whom had he come to\nsee? They mentioned his name to him, and he immediately cut short the\nexplanations they were adding, to enable him to straighten out the\ntangled skein of relationship.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe father of Charles--I know, I know! The son of my nephew Saccard,\n_pardi_! the one who made a fine marriage, and whose wife died--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe stared at Maxime, seeming happy to find him already wrinkled at\nthirty-two, with his hair and beard sprinkled with snow.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, well!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe are all growing old. But I, at least, have no\ngreat reason to complain. I am solid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he planted himself firmly on his legs with his air of ferocious\nmockery, while his fiery red face seemed to flame and burn. For a\nlong time past ordinary brandy had seemed to him like pure water; only\nspirits of 36 degrees tickled his blunted palate; and he took such\ndraughts of it that he was full of it--his flesh saturated with it--like\na sponge. He perspired alcohol. At the slightest breath whenever he\nspoke, he exhaled from his mouth a vapor of alcohol.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, truly; you are solid, uncle!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Pascal, amazed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you have\ndone nothing to make you so; you have good reason to ridicule us. Only\nthere is one thing I am afraid of, look you, that some day in lighting\nyour pipe, you may set yourself on fire--like a bowl of punch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMacquart, flattered, gave a sneering laugh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave your jest, have your jest, my boy! A glass of cognac is worth more\nthan all your filthy drugs. And you will all touch glasses with me, hey?\nSo that it may be said truly that your uncle is a credit to you all.\nAs for me, I laugh at evil tongues. I have corn and olive trees, I have\nalmond trees and vines and land, like any _bourgeois_. In summer I smoke\nmy pipe under the shade of my mulberry trees; in winter I go to smoke it\nagainst my wall, there in the sunshine. One has no need to blush for an\nuncle like that, hey? Clotilde, I have syrup, if you would like some.\nAnd you, Felicite, my dear, I know that you prefer anisette. There is\neverything here, I tell you, there is everything here!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe waved his arm as if to take possession of the comforts he enjoyed,\nnow that from an old sinner he had become a hermit, while Felicite, whom\nhe had disturbed a moment before by the enumeration of his riches, did\nnot take her eyes from his face, waiting to interrupt him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you, Macquart, we will take nothing; we are in a hurry. Where is\nCharles?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCharles? Very good, presently! I understand, papa has come to see his\nboy. But that is not going to prevent you taking a glass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd as they positively refused he became offended, and said, with his\nmalicious laugh:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCharles is not here; he is at the asylum with the old woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, taking Maxime to the end of the terrace, he pointed out to him the\ngreat white buildings, whose inner gardens resembled prison yards.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, nephew, you see those three trees in front of you? Well, beyond\nthe one to the left, there is a fountain in a court. Follow the ground\nfloor, and the fifth window to the right is Aunt Dide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. And that is\nwhere the boy is. Yes, I took him there a little while ago.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was an indulgence of the directors. In the twenty years that she\nhad been in the asylum the old woman had not given a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uneasiness\nto her keeper. Very quiet, very gentle, she passed the days motionless\nin her easy-chair, looking straight before her; and as the boy liked to\nbe with her, and as she herself seemed to take an interest in him,\nthey shut their eyes to this infraction of the rules and left him there\nsometimes for two or three hours at a time, busily occupied in cutting\nout pictures.\n\nBut this new disappointment put the finishing stroke to Felicite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nill-humor; she grew angry when Macquart proposed that all five should go\nin a body in search of the boy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat an idea! Go you alone, and come back quickly. We have no time to\nlose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHer suppressed rage seemed to amuse Uncle Macquart, and perceiving how\ndisagreeable his proposition was to her, he insisted, with his sneering\nlaugh:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, my children, we should at the same time have an opportunity of\nseeing the old mother; the mother of us all. There is no use in talking;\nyou know that we are all descended from her, and it would hardly be\npolite not to go wish her a good-day, when my grandnephew, who has come\nfrom such a distance, has perhaps never before had a good look at her.\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll not disown her, may the devil take me if I do. To be sure she is\nmad, but all the same, old mothers who have passed their hundredth year\nare not often to be seen, and she well deserves that we should show\nourselves a little kind to her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was silence for a moment. A little shiver had run through every\none. And it was Clotilde, silent until now, who first declared in a\nvoice full of feeling:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are right, uncle; we will all go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite herself was obliged to consent. They re-entered the landau,\nMacquart taking the seat beside the coachman. A feeling of disquietude\nhad given a sallow look to Maxime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worn face; and during the short\ndrive he questioned Pascal concerning Charles with an air of paternal\ninterest, which concealed a growing anxiety. The doctor constrained\nby his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s imperious glances, softened the truth. Well, the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhealth was certainly not very robust; it was on that account, indeed,\nthat they were glad to leave him for weeks together in the country with\nhis uncle: but he had no definite disease. Pascal did not add that he\nhad for a moment cherished the dream of giving him a brain and muscles\nby treating him with his hypodermic injections of nerve substance,\nbut that he had always been met by the same difficulty; the slightest\npuncture brought on a hemorrhage which it was found necessary to stop\nby compresses; there was a laxness of the tissues, due to degeneracy; a\nbloody dew which exuded from the skin; he had especially, bleedings at\nthe nose so sudden and so violent that they did not dare to leave him\nalone, fearing lest all the blood in his veins should flow out. And the\ndoctor ended by saying that although the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intelligence had been\nsluggish, he still hoped that it would develop in an environment of\nquicker mental activity.\n\nThey arrived at the asylum and Macquart, who had been listening to the\ndoctor, descended from his seat, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is a gentle little fellow, a very gentle little fellow! And then, he\nis so beautiful--an angel!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMaxime, who was still pale, and who shivered in spite of the stifling\nheat, put no more questions. He looked at the vast buildings of the\nasylum, the wings of the various quarters separated by gardens, the\nmen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quarters from those of the women, those of the harmless insane\nfrom those of the violent insane. A scrupulous cleanliness reigned\neverywhere, a gloomy silence--broken from time to time by footsteps and\nthe noise of keys. Old Macquart knew all the keepers. Besides, the doors\nwere always to open to Dr. Pascal, who had been authorized to attend\ncertain of the inmates. They followed a passage and entered a court; it\nwas here--one of the chambers on the ground floor, a room covered with\na light carpet, furnished with a bed, a press, a table, an armchair, and\ntwo chairs. The nurse, who had orders never to quit her charge, happened\njust now to be absent, and the only occupants of the room were the\nmadwoman, sitting rigid in her armchair at one side of the table, and\nthe boy, sitting on a chair on the opposite side, absorbed in cutting\nout his pictures.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo in, go in!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Macquart repeated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, there is no danger, she is very\ngentle!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe grandmother, Adelaide Fouque, whom her grandchildren, a whole swarm\nof descendants, called by the pet name of Aunt Dide, did not even turn\nher head at the noise. In her youth hysterical troubles had unbalanced\nher mind. Of an ardent and passionate nature and subject to nervous\nattacks, she had yet reached the great age of eighty-three when a\ndreadful grief, a terrible moral shock, destroyed her reason. At that\ntime, twenty-one years before, her mind had ceased to act; it had become\nsuddenly weakened without the possibility of recovery. And now, at the\nage of 104 years, she lived here as if forgotten by the world, a\nquiet madwoman with an ossified brain, with whom insanity might remain\nstationary for an indefinite length of time without causing death. Old\nage had come, however, and had gradually atrophied her muscles. Her\nflesh was as if eaten away by age. The skin only remained on her bones,\nso that she had to be carried from her chair to her bed, for it had\nbecome impossible for her to walk or even to move. And yet she held\nherself erect against the back of her chair, a yellow, dried-up\nskeleton--like an ancient tree of which the bark only remains--with only\nher eyes still living in her thin, long visage, in which the wrinkles\nhad been, so to say, worn away. She was looking fixedly at Charles.\n\nClotilde approached her a little tremblingly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAunt Dide, it is we; we have come to see you. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you know me, then?\nYour little girl who comes sometimes to kiss you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the madwoman did not seem to hear. Her eyes remained fixed upon the\nboy, who was finishing cutting out a picture--a purple king in a golden\nmantle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, mamma,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Macquart, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pretend to be stupid. You may very\nwell look at us. Here is a gentleman, a grandson of yours, who has come\nfrom Paris expressly to see you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this voice Aunt Dide at last turned her head. Her clear,\nexpressionless eyes wandered slowly from one to another, then rested\nagain on Charles with the same fixed look as before.\n\nThey all shivered, and no one spoke again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSince the terrible shock she received,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explained Pascal in a low\nvoice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe has been that way; all intelligence, all memory seem\nextinguished in her. For the most part she is silent; at times she pours\nforth a flood of stammering and indistinct words. She laughs and cries\nwithout cause, she is a thing that nothing affects. And yet I should\nnot venture to say that the darkness of her mind is complete, that no\nmemories remain stored up in its depths. Ah! the poor old mother, how I\npity her, if the light has not yet been finally extinguished. What\ncan her thoughts have been for the last twenty-one years, if she still\nremembers?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith a gesture he put this dreadful past which he knew from him. He\nsaw her again young, a tall, pale, slender girl with frightened eyes,\na widow, after fifteen months of married life with Rougon, the clumsy\ngardener whom she had chosen for a husband, throwing herself immediately\nafterwards into the arms of the smuggler Macquart, whom she loved with\na wolfish love, and whom she did not even marry. She had lived thus for\nfifteen years, with her three children, one the child of her marriage,\nthe other two illegitimate, a capricious and tumultuous existence,\ndisappearing for weeks at a time, and returning all bruised, her arms\nblack and blue. Then Macquart had been killed, shot down like a dog by a\n_gendarme_; and the first shock had paralyzed her, so that even then she\nretained nothing living but her water-clear eyes in her livid face; and\nshe shut herself up from the world in the hut which her lover had left\nher, leading there for forty years the dead existence of a nun, broken\nby terrible nervous attacks. But the other shock was to finish her, to\noverthrow her reason, and Pascal recalled the atrocious scene, for he\nhad witnessed it--a poor child whom the grandmother had taken to live\nwith her, her grandson Silvere, the victim of family hatred and strife,\nwhose head another _gendarme_ shattered with a pistol shot, at the\nsuppression of the insurrectionary movement of 1851. She was always to\nbe bespattered with blood.\n\nFelicite, meanwhile, had approached Charles, who was so engrossed with\nhis pictures that all these people did not disturb him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy darling, this gentleman is your father. Kiss him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\nAnd then they all occupied themselves with Charles. He was very prettily\ndressed in a jacket and short trousers of black velvet, braided with\ngold cord. Pale as a lily, he resembled in truth one of those king\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsons whose pictures he was cutting out, with his large, light eyes and\nhis shower of fair curls. But what especially struck the attention at\nthis moment was his resemblance to Aunt Dide; this resemblance which\nhad overleaped three generations, which had passed from this withered\ncentenarian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s countenance, from these dead features wasted by life, to\nthis delicate child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face that was also as if worn, aged, and wasted,\nthrough the wear of the race. Fronting each other, the imbecile child of\na deathlike beauty seemed the last of the race of which she, forgotten\nby the world, was the ancestress.\n\nMaxime bent over to press a kiss on the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forehead; and a chill\nstruck to his heart--this very beauty disquieted him; his uneasiness\ngrew in this chamber of madness, whence, it seemed to him, breathed a\nsecret horror come from the far-off past.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow beautiful you are, my pet! Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you love me a little?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCharles looked at him without comprehending, and went back to his play.\n\nBut all were chilled. Without the set expression of her countenance\nchanging Aunt Dide wept, a flood of tears rolled from her living eyes\nover her dead cheeks. Her gaze fixed immovably upon the boy, she wept\nslowly, endlessly. A great thing had happened.\n\nAnd now an extraordinary emotion took possession of Pascal. He caught\nClotilde by the arm and pressed it hard, trying to make her understand.\nBefore his eyes appeared the whole line, the legitimate branch and the\nbastard branch, which had sprung from this trunk already vitiated by\nneurosis. Five generations were there present--the Rougons and the\nMacquarts, Adelaide Fouque at the root, then the scoundrelly old uncle,\nthen himself, then Clotilde and Maxime, and lastly, Charles. Felicite\noccupied the place of her dead husband. There was no link wanting; the\nchain of heredity, logical and implacable, was unbroken. And what a\nworld was evoked from the depths of the tragic cabin which breathed\nthis horror that came from the far-off past in such appalling shape that\nevery one, notwithstanding the oppressive heat, shivered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is it, master?\u00e2\u0080\u009d whispered Clotilde, trembling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, nothing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d murmured the doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will tell you later.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMacquart, who alone continued to sneer, scolded the old mother. What an\nidea was hers, to receive people with tears when they put themselves out\nto come and make her a visit. It was scarcely polite. And then he turned\nto Maxime and Charles.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, nephew, you have seen your boy at last. Is it not true that he is\npretty, and that he is a credit to you, after all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite hastened to interfere. Greatly dissatisfied with the turn which\naffairs were taking, she was now anxious only to get away.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is certainly a handsome boy, and less backward than people think.\nJust see how skilful he is with his hands. And you will see when you\nhave brightened him up in Paris, in a different way from what we have\nbeen able to do at Plassans, eh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo doubt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d murmured Maxime. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not say no; I will think about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe seemed embarrassed for a moment, and then added:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know I came only to see him. I cannot take him with me now as I am\nto spend a month at St. Gervais. But as soon as I return to Paris I will\nthink of it, I will write to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, taking out his watch, he cried:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe devil! Half-past five. You know that I would not miss the nine\no\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock train for anything in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes, let us go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Felicite brusquely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have nothing more to\ndo here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMacquart, whom his sister-in-law\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anger seemed still to divert,\nendeavored to delay them with all sorts of stories. He told of the days\nwhen Aunt Dide talked, and he affirmed that he had found her one morning\nsinging a romance of her youth. And then he had no need of the carriage,\nhe would take the boy back on foot, since they left him to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKiss your papa, my boy, for you know now that you see him, but you\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know whether you shall ever see him again or not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith the same surprised and indifferent movement Charles raised his\nhead, and Maxime, troubled, pressed another kiss on his forehead.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe very good and very pretty, my pet. And love me a little.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, come, we have no time to lose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated Felicite.\n\nBut the keeper here re-entered the room. She was a stout, vigorous girl,\nattached especially to the service of the madwoman. She carried her to\nand from her bed, night and morning; she fed her and took care of her\nlike a child. And she at once entered into conversation with Dr. Pascal,\nwho questioned her. One of the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most cherished dreams was to\ncure the mad by his treatment of hypodermic injections. Since in their\ncase it was the brain that was in danger, why should not hypodermic\ninjections of nerve substance give them strength and will, repairing\nthe breaches made in the organ? So that for a moment he had dreamed\nof trying the treatment with the old mother; then he began to have\nscruples, he felt a sort of awe, without counting that madness at\nthat age was total, irreparable ruin. So that he had chosen another\nsubject--a hatter named Sarteur, who had been for a year past in the\nasylum, to which he had come himself to beg them to shut him up to\nprevent him from committing a crime. In his paroxysms, so strong an\nimpulse to kill seized him that he would have thrown himself upon the\nfirst passer-by. He was of small stature, very dark, with a retreating\nforehead, an aquiline face with a large nose and a very short chin, and\nhis left cheek was noticeably larger than his right. And the doctor had\nobtained miraculous results with this victim of emotional insanity, who\nfor a month past had had no attack. The nurse, indeed being questioned,\nanswered that Sarteur had become quiet and was growing better every day.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you hear, Clotilde?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Pascal, enchanted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have not the time\nto see him this evening, but I will come again to-morrow. It is my\nvisiting day. Ah, if I only dared; if she were young still--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis eyes turned toward Aunt Dide. But Clotilde, whom his enthusiasm made\nsmile, said gently:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, master, you cannot make life anew. There, come. We are the\nlast.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was true; the others had already gone. Macquart, on the threshold,\nfollowed Felicite and Maxime with his mocking glance as they went away.\nAunt Dide, the forgotten one, sat motionless, appalling in her leanness,\nher eyes again fixed upon Charles with his white, worn face framed in\nhis royal locks.\n\nThe drive back was full of constraint. In the heat which exhaled from\nthe earth, the landau rolled on heavily to the measured trot of the\nhorses. The stormy sky took on an ashen, copper-colored hue in the\ndeepening twilight. At first a few indifferent words were exchanged;\nbut from the moment in which they entered the gorges of the Seille all\nconversation ceased, as if they felt oppressed by the menacing walls of\ngiant rock that seemed closing in upon them. Was not this the end of the\nearth, and were they not going to roll into the unknown, over the edge\nof some abyss? An eagle soared by, uttering a shrill cry.\n\nWillows appeared again, and the carriage was rolling lightly along the\nbank of the Viorne, when Felicite began without transition, as if she\nwere resuming a conversation already commenced.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have no refusal to fear from the mother. She loves Charles dearly,\nbut she is a very sensible woman, and she understands perfectly that it\nis to the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advantage that you should take him with you. And I must\ntell you, too, that the poor boy is not very happy with her, since,\nnaturally, the husband prefers his own son and daughter. For you ought\nto know everything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she went on in this strain, hoping, no doubt, to persuade Maxime and\ndraw a formal promise from him. She talked until they reached Plassans.\nThen, suddenly, as the landau rolled over the pavement of the faubourg,\nshe said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut look! there is his mother. That stout blond at the door there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt the threshold of a harness-maker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shop hung round with horse\ntrappings and halters, Justine sat, knitting a stocking, taking the air,\nwhile the little girl and boy were playing on the ground at her feet.\nAnd behind them in the shadow of the shop was to be seen Thomas, a\nstout, dark man, occupied in repairing a saddle.\n\nMaxime leaned forward without emotion, simply curious. He was greatly\nsurprised at sight of this robust woman of thirty-two, with so sensible\nand so commonplace an air, in whom there was not a trace of the wild\nlittle girl with whom he had been in love when both of the same age were\nentering their seventeenth year. Perhaps a pang shot through his heart\nto see her plump and tranquil and blooming, while he was ill and already\naged.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should never have recognized her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nAnd the landau, still rolling on, turned into the Rue de Rome. Justine\nhad disappeared; this vision of the past--a past so different from the\npresent--had sunk into the shadowy twilight, with Thomas, the children,\nand the shop.\n\nAt La Souleiade the table was set; Martine had an eel from the Viorne,\na _sauted_ rabbit, and a leg of mutton. Seven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock was striking, and\nthey had plenty of time to dine quietly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be uneasy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Pascal to his nephew. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will accompany you\nto the station; it is not ten minutes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 walk from here. As you left your\ntrunk, you have nothing to do but to get your ticket and jump on board\nthe train.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, meeting Clotilde in the vestibule, where she was hanging up her\nhat and her umbrella, he said to her in an undertone:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know that I am uneasy about your brother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have observed him attentively. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the way in which he\nwalks; and have you noticed what an anxious look he has at times?\nThat has never deceived me. In short, your brother is threatened with\nataxia.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAtaxia!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she repeated turning very pale.\n\nA cruel image rose before her, that of a neighbor, a man still young,\nwhom for the past ten years she had seen driven about in a little\ncarriage by a servant. Was not this infirmity the worst of all ills, the\nax stroke that separates a living being from social and active life?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she murmured, \u00e2\u0080\u009che complains only of rheumatism.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal shrugged his shoulders; and putting a finger to his lip he went\ninto the dining-room, where Felicite and Maxime were seated.\n\nThe dinner was very friendly. The sudden disquietude which had sprung up\nin Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart made her still more affectionate to her brother, who\nsat beside her. She attended to his wants gayly, forcing him to take the\nmost delicate morsels. Twice she called back Martine, who was passing\nthe dishes too quickly. And Maxime was more and more enchanted by this\nsister, who was so good, so healthy, so sensible, whose charm enveloped\nhim like a caress. So greatly was he captivated by her that gradually\na project, vague at first, took definite shape within him. Since little\nCharles, his son, terrified him so greatly with his deathlike beauty,\nhis royal air of sickly imbecility, why should he not take his sister\nClotilde to live with him? The idea of having a woman in his house\nalarmed him, indeed, for he was afraid of all women, having had too\nmuch experience of them in his youth; but this one seemed to him truly\nmaternal. And then, too, a good woman in his house would make a change\nin it, which would be a desirable thing. He would at least be left no\nlonger at the mercy of his father, whom he suspected of desiring his\ndeath so that he might get possession of his money at once. His hatred\nand terror of his father decided him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think of marrying, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked, wishing to try the\nground.\n\nThe young girl laughed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, there is no hurry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered.\n\nThen, suddenly, looking at Pascal, who had raised his head, she added:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can I tell? Oh, I shall never marry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Felicite protested. When she saw her so attached to the doctor, she\noften wished for a marriage that would separate her from him, that would\nleave her son alone in a deserted home, where she herself might become\nall powerful, mistress of everything. Therefore she appealed to him. Was\nit not true that a woman ought to marry, that it was against nature to\nremain an old maid?\n\nAnd he gravely assented, without taking his eyes from Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes, she must marry. She is too sensible not to marry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d interrupted Maxime, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould it be really sensible in her to\nmarry? In order to be unhappy, perhaps; there are so many ill-assorted\nmarriages!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd coming to a resolution, he added:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you know what you ought to do? Well, you ought to come and live\nwith me in Paris. I have thought the matter over. The idea of taking\ncharge of a child in my state of health terrifies me. Am I not a child\nmyself, an invalid who needs to be taken care of? You will take care of\nme; you will be with me, if I should end by losing the use of my limbs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a sound of tears in his voice, so great a pity did he feel\nfor himself. He saw himself, in fancy, sick; he saw his sister at his\nbedside, like a Sister of Charity; if she consented to remain unmarried\nhe would willingly leave her his fortune, so that his father might not\nhave it. The dread which he had of solitude, the need in which he should\nperhaps stand of having a sick-nurse, made him very pathetic.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would be very kind on your part, and you should have no cause to\nrepent it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMartine, who was serving the mutton, stopped short in surprise; and\nthe proposition caused the same surprise at the table. Felicite was the\nfirst to approve, feeling that the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure would further her\nplans. She looked at Clotilde, who was still silent and stunned, as it\nwere; while Dr. Pascal waited with a pale face.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, brother, brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d stammered the young girl, unable at first to\nthink of anything else to say.\n\nThen her grandmother cried:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that all you have to say? Why, the proposition your brother has just\nmade you is a very advantageous one. If he is afraid of taking Charles\nnow, why, you can go with him, and later on you can send for the child.\nCome, come, that can be very well arranged. Your brother makes an appeal\nto your heart. Is it not true, Pascal, that she owes him a favorable\nanswer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe doctor, by an effort, recovered his self-possession. The chill that\nhad seized him made itself felt, however, in the slowness with which he\nspoke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe offer, in effect, is very kind. Clotilde, as I said before, is very\nsensible and she will accept it, if it is right that she should do so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young girl, greatly agitated, rebelled at this.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you wish to send me away, then, master? Maxime is very good, and I\nthank him from the bottom of my heart. But to leave everything, my God!\nTo leave all that love me, all that I have loved until now!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe made a despairing gesture, indicating the place and the people,\ntaking in all La Souleiade.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut,\u00e2\u0080\u009d responded Pascal, looking at her fixedly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat if Maxime should\nneed you, what if you had a duty to fulfil toward him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHer eyes grew moist, and she remained for a moment trembling and\ndesperate; for she alone understood. The cruel vision again arose before\nher--Maxime, helpless, driven, about in a little carriage by a servant,\nlike the neighbor whom she used to pity. Had she indeed any duty toward\na brother who for fifteen years had been a stranger to her? Did not\nher duty lie where her heart was? Nevertheless, her distress of mind\ncontinued; she still suffered in the struggle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen, Maxime,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said at last, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgive me also time to reflect. I\nwill see. Be assured that I am very grateful to you. And if you should\none day really have need of me, well, I should no doubt decide to go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was all they could make her promise. Felicite, with her usual\nvehemence, exhausted all her efforts in vain, while the doctor now\naffected to say that she had given her word. Martine brought a cream,\nwithout thinking of hiding her joy. To take away mademoiselle! what an\nidea, in order that monsieur might die of grief at finding himself all\nalone. And the dinner was delayed, too, by this unexpected incident.\nThey were still at the dessert when half-past eight struck.\n\nThen Maxime grew restless, tapped the floor with his foot, and declared\nthat he must go.\n\nAt the station, whither they all accompanied him he kissed his sister a\nlast time, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRemember!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be afraid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d declared Felicite, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe are here to remind her of her\npromise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe doctor smiled, and all three, as soon as the train was in motion,\nwaved their handkerchiefs.\n\nOn this day, after accompanying the grandmother to her door, Dr. Pascal\nand Clotilde returned peacefully to La Souleiade, and spent a delightful\nevening there. The constraint of the past few weeks, the secret\nantagonism which had separated them, seemed to have vanished. Never had\nit seemed so sweet to them to feel so united, inseparable. Doubtless it\nwas only this first pang of uneasiness suffered by their affection, this\nthreatened separation, the postponement of which delighted them. It was\nfor them like a return to health after an illness, a new hope of life.\nThey remained for long time in the warm night, under the plane trees,\nlistening to the crystal murmur of the fountain. And they did not even\nspeak, so profoundly did they enjoy the happiness of being together.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\nTen days later the household had fallen back into its former state of\nunhappiness. Pascal and Clotilde remained entire afternoons without\nexchanging a word; and there were continual outbursts of ill-humor. Even\nMartine was constantly out of temper. The home of these three had again\nbecome a hell.\n\nThen suddenly the condition of affairs was still further aggravated. A\nCapuchin monk of great sanctity, such as often pass through the towns\nof the South, came to Plassans to conduct a mission. The pulpit of\nSt. Saturnin resounded with his bursts of eloquence. He was a sort of\napostle, a popular and fiery orator, a florid speaker, much given to the\nuse of metaphors. And he preached on the nothingness of modern science\nwith an extraordinary mystical exaltation, denying the reality of this\nworld, and disclosing the unknown, the mysteries of the Beyond. All the\ndevout women of the town were full of excitement about his preaching.\n\nOn the very first evening on which Clotilde, accompanied by Martine,\nattended the sermon, Pascal noticed her feverish excitement when\nshe returned. On the following day her excitement increased, and she\nreturned home later, having remained to pray for an hour in a dark\ncorner of a chapel. From this time she was never absent from the\nservices, returning languid, and with the luminous eyes of a seer; and\nthe Capuchin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s burning words haunted her; certain of his images stirred\nher to ecstasy. She grew irritable, and she seemed to have conceived a\nfeeling of anger and contempt for every one and everything around her.\n\nPascal, filled with uneasiness, determined to have an explanation\nwith Martine. He came down early one morning as she was sweeping the\ndining-room.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know that I leave you and Clotilde free to go to church, if\nthat pleases you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not believe in oppressing any one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nconscience. But I do not wish that you should make her sick.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe servant, without stopping in her work, said in a low voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps the sick people are those who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that they are sick.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe said this with such an air of conviction that he smiled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he returned; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am the sick soul whose conversion you pray for;\nwhile both of you are in possession of health and of perfect wisdom.\nMartine, if you continue to torment me and to torment yourselves, as you\nare doing, I shall grow angry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe spoke in so furious and so harsh a voice that the servant stopped\nsuddenly in her sweeping, and looked him full in the face. An infinite\ntenderness, an immense desolation passed over the face of the old maid\ncloistered in his service. And tears filled her eyes and she hurried out\nof the room stammering:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, monsieur, you do not love us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen Pascal, filled with an overwhelming sadness, gave up the contest.\nHis remorse increased for having shown so much tolerance, for not having\nexercised his authority as master, in directing Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s education\nand bringing up. In his belief that trees grew straight if they were\nnot interfered with, he had allowed her to grow up in her own way, after\nteaching her merely to read and write. It was without any preconceived\nplan, while aiding him in making his researches and correcting his\nmanuscripts, and simply by the force of circumstances, that she had\nread everything and acquired a fondness for the natural sciences. How\nbitterly he now regretted his indifference! What a powerful impulse he\nmight have given to this clear mind, so eager for knowledge, instead\nof allowing it to go astray, and waste itself in that desire for the\nBeyond, which Grandmother Felicite and the good Martine favored. While\nhe had occupied himself with facts, endeavoring to keep from going\nbeyond the phenomenon, and succeeding in doing so, through his\nscientific discipline, he had seen her give all her thoughts to the\nunknown, the mysterious. It was with her an obsession, an instinctive\ncuriosity which amounted to torture when she could not satisfy it. There\nwas in her a longing which nothing could appease, an irresistible call\ntoward the unattainable, the unknowable. Even when she was a child, and\nstill more, later, when she grew up, she went straight to the why and\nthe how of things, she demanded ultimate causes. If he showed her a\nflower, she asked why this flower produced a seed, why this seed would\ngerminate. Then, it would be the mystery of birth and death, and the\nunknown forces, and God, and all things. In half a dozen questions she\nwould drive him into a corner, obliging him each time to acknowledge his\nfatal ignorance; and when he no longer knew what to answer her, when he\nwould get rid of her with a gesture of comic fury, she would give a gay\nlaugh of triumph, and go to lose herself again in her dreams, in\nthe limitless vision of all that we do not know, and all that we\nmay believe. Often she astounded him by her explanations. Her mind,\nnourished on science, started from proved truths, but with such an\nimpetus that she bounded at once straight into the heaven of the\nlegends. All sorts of mediators passed there, angels and saints and\nsupernatural inspirations, modifying matter, endowing it with life; or,\nagain, it was only one single force, the soul of the world, working to\nfuse things and beings in a final kiss of love in fifty centuries more.\nShe had calculated the number of them, she said.\n\nFor the rest, Pascal had never before seen her so excited. For the\npast week, during which she had attended the Capuchin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission in the\ncathedral, she had spent the days visibly in the expectation of the\nsermon of the evening; and she went to hear it with the rapt exaltation\nof a girl who is going to her first rendezvous of love. Then, on the\nfollowing day, everything about her declared her detachment from the\nexterior life, from her accustomed existence, as if the visible world,\nthe necessary actions of every moment, were but a snare and a folly.\nShe retired within herself in the vision of what was not. Thus she had\nalmost completely given up her habitual occupations, abandoning herself\nto a sort of unconquerable indolence, remaining for hours at a time\nwith her hands in her lap, her gaze lost in vacancy, rapt in the\ncontemplation of some far-off vision. Now she, who had been so active,\nso early a riser, rose late, appearing barely in time for the second\nbreakfast, and it could not have been at her toilet that she spent these\nlong hours, for she forgot her feminine coquetry, and would come down\nwith her hair scarcely combed, negligently attired in a gown buttoned\nawry, but even thus adorable, thanks to her triumphant youth. The\nmorning walks through La Souleiade that she had been so fond of, the\nraces from the top to the bottom of the terraces planted with olive and\nalmond trees, the visits to the pine grove balmy with the odor of resin,\nthe long sun baths in the hot threshing yard, she indulged in no more;\nshe preferred to remain shut up in her darkened room, from which not a\nmovement was to be heard. Then, in the afternoon, in the work room, she\nwould drag herself about languidly from chair to chair, doing nothing,\ntired and disgusted with everything that had formerly interested her.\n\nPascal was obliged to renounce her assistance; a paper which he gave\nher to copy remained three days untouched on her desk. She no longer\nclassified anything; she would not have stooped down to pick up a paper\nfrom the floor. More than all, she abandoned the pastels, copies of\nflowers from nature that she had been making, to serve as plates to a\nwork on artificial fecundations. Some large red mallows, of a new and\nsingular coloring, faded in their vase before she had finished copying\nthem. And yet for a whole afternoon she worked enthusiastically at\na fantastic design of dream flowers, an extraordinary efflorescence\nblooming in the light of a miraculous sun, a burst of golden\nspike-shaped rays in the center of large purple corollas, resembling\nopen hearts, whence shot, for pistils, a shower of stars, myriads of\nworlds streaming into the sky, like a milky way.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, my poor girl,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the doctor to her on this day, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow can you\nlose your time in such conceits! And I waiting for the copy of those\nmallows that you have left to die there. And you will make yourself ill.\nThere is no health, nor beauty, even, possible outside reality.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOften now she did not answer, intrenching herself behind her fierce\nconvictions, not wishing to dispute. But doubtless he had this time\ntouched her beliefs to the quick.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no reality,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered sharply.\n\nThe doctor, amused by this bold philosophy from this big child, laughed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cour senses are fallible. We know this world\nonly through our senses, consequently it is possible that the world\ndoes not exist. Let us open the door to madness, then; let us accept\nas possible the most absurd chimeras, let us live in the realm of\nnightmare, outside of laws and facts. For do you not see that there is\nno longer any law if you suppress nature, and that the only thing that\ngives life any interest is to believe in life, to love it, and to put\nall the forces of our intelligence to the better understanding of it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe made a gesture of mingled indifference and bravado, and the\nconversation dropped. Now she was laying large strokes of blue crayon\non the pastel, bringing out its flaming splendor in strong relief on the\nbackground of a clear summer night.\n\nBut two days later, in consequence of a fresh discussion, matters went\nstill further amiss. In the evening, on leaving the table, Pascal went\nup to the study to write, while she remained out of doors, sitting on\nthe terrace. Hours passed by, and he was surprised and uneasy, when\nmidnight struck, that he had not yet heard her return to her room. She\nwould have had to pass through the study, and he was very certain that\nshe had not passed unnoticed by him. Going downstairs, he found that\nMartine was asleep; the vestibule door was not locked, and Clotilde\nmust have remained outside, oblivious of the flight of time. This often\nhappened to her on these warm nights, but she had never before remained\nout so late.\n\nThe doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uneasiness increased when he perceived on the terrace the\nchair, now vacant, in which the young girl had been sitting. He had\nexpected to find her asleep in it. Since she was not there, why had she\nnot come in. Where could she have gone at such an hour? The night was\nbeautiful: a September night, still warm, with a wide sky whose dark,\nvelvety expanse was studded with stars; and from the depths of this\nmoonless sky the stars shone so large and bright that they lighted the\nearth with a pale, mysterious radiance. He leaned over the balustrade of\nthe terrace, and examined the slope and the stone steps which led down\nto the railroad; but there was not a movement. He saw nothing but the\nround motionless tops of the little olive trees. The idea then occurred\nto him that she must certainly be under the plane trees beside the\nfountain, whose murmuring waters made perpetual coolness around. He\nhurried there, and found himself enveloped in such thick darkness that\nhe, who knew every tree, was obliged to walk with outstretched hands\nto avoid stumbling. Then he groped his way through the dark pine grove,\nstill without meeting any one. And at last he called in a muffled voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cClotilde! Clotilde!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe darkness remained silent and impenetrable.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cClotilde! Clotilde!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried again, in a louder voice. Not a sound,\nnot a breath. The very echoes seemed asleep. His cry was drowned in the\ninfinitely soft lake of blue shadows. And then he called her with all\nthe force of his lungs. He returned to the plane trees. He went back to\nthe pine grove, beside himself with fright, scouring the entire domain.\nThen, suddenly, he found himself in the threshing yard.\n\nAt this cool and tranquil hour, the immense yard, the vast circular\npaved court, slept too. It was so many years since grain had been\nthreshed here that grass had sprung up among the stones, quickly\nscorched a russet brown by the sun, resembling the long threads of\na woolen carpet. And, under the tufts of this feeble vegetation, the\nancient pavement did not cool during the whole summer, smoking from\nsunset, exhaling in the night the heat stored up from so many sultry\nnoons.\n\nThe yard stretched around, bare and deserted, in the cooling atmosphere,\nunder the infinite calm of the sky, and Pascal was crossing it to hurry\nto the orchard, when he almost fell over a form that he had not\nbefore observed, extended at full length upon the ground. He uttered a\nfrightened cry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! Are you here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde did not deign even to answer. She was lying on her back, her\nhands clasped under the back of her neck, her face turned toward the\nsky; and in her pale countenance, only her large shining eyes were\nvisible.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd here I have been tormenting myself and calling you for an hour\npast! Did you not hear me shouting?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe at last unclosed her lips.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen that is very senseless! Why did you not answer me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut she fell back into her former silence, refusing all explanation, and\nwith a stubborn brow kept her gaze fixed steadily on the sky.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere, come in and go to bed, naughty child. You will tell me\nto-morrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did not stir, however; he begged her ten times over to go into the\nhouse, but she would not move. He ended by sitting down beside her on\nthe short grass, through which penetrated the warmth of the pavement\nbeneath.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you cannot sleep out of doors. At least answer me. What are you\ndoing here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am looking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd from her large eyes, fixed and motionless, her gaze seemed to mount\nup among the stars. She seemed wholly absorbed in the contemplation of\nthe pure starry depths of the summer sky.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, master!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued, in a low monotone; \u00e2\u0080\u009chow narrow and limited\nis all that you know compared to what there is surely up there. Yes,\nif I did not answer you it was because I was thinking of you, and I was\nfilled with grief. You must not think me bad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn her voice there was a thrill of such tenderness that it moved him\nprofoundly. He stretched himself on the grass beside her, so that their\nelbows touched, and they went on talking.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI greatly fear, my dear, that your griefs are not rational. It gives\nyou pain to think of me. Why so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, because of things that I should find it hard to explain to you; I\nam not a _savante_. You have taught me much, however, and I have learned\nmore myself, being with you. Besides, they are things that I feel.\nPerhaps I might try to tell them to you, as we are all alone here, and\nthe night is so beautiful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHer full heart overflowed, after hours of meditation, in the peaceful\nconfidence of the beautiful night. He did not speak, fearing to disturb\nher, but awaited her confidences in silence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I was a little girl and you used to talk to me about science, it\nseemed to me that you were speaking to me of God, your words burned so\nwith faith and hope. Nothing seemed impossible to you. With science you\nwere going to penetrate the secret of the world, and make the perfect\nhappiness of humanity a reality. According to you, we were progressing\nwith giant strides. Each day brought its discovery, its certainty. Ten,\nfifty, a hundred years more, perhaps, and the heavens would open and we\nshould see truth face to face. Well, the years pass, and nothing opens,\nand truth recedes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are an impatient girl,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered simply. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf ten centuries more\nbe necessary we must only wait for them to pass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is true. I cannot wait. I need to know; I need to be happy at once,\nand to know everything at once, and to be perfectly and forever happy.\nOh, that is what makes me suffer, not to be able to reach at a bound\ncomplete knowledge, not to be able to rest in perfect felicity, freed\nfrom scruples and doubts. Is it living to advance with tortoiselike pace\nin the darkness, not to be able to enjoy an hour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tranquillity, without\ntrembling at the thought of the coming anguish? No, no! All knowledge\nand all happiness in a single day? Science has promised them to us, and\nif she does not give them to us, then she fails in her engagements.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he, too, began to grow heated.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what you are saying is folly, little girl. Science is not\nrevelation. It marches at its human pace, its very effort is its glory.\nAnd then it is not true that science has promised happiness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe interrupted him hastily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow, not true! Open your books up there, then. You know that I have\nread them. Do they not overflow with promises? To read them one would\nthink we were marching on to the conquest of earth and heaven. They\ndemolish everything, and they swear to replace everything--and that\nby pure reason, with stability and wisdom. Doubtless I am like the\nchildren. When I am promised anything I wish that it shall be given\nme at once. My imagination sets to work, and the object must be very\nbeautiful to satisfy me. But it would have been easy not to have\npromised anything. And above all, at this hour, in view of my eager and\npainful longing, it would be very ill done to tell me that nothing has\nbeen promised me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe made a gesture, a simple gesture of protestation and impatience, in\nthe serene and silent night.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn any case,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cscience has swept away all our past\nbeliefs. The earth is bare, the heavens are empty, and what do you wish\nthat I should become, even if you acquit science of having inspired the\nhopes I have conceived? For I cannot live without belief and without\nhappiness. On what solid ground shall I build my house when science\nshall have demolished the old world, and while she is waiting to\nconstruct the new? All the ancient city has fallen to pieces in this\ncatastrophe of examination and analysis; and all that remains of it is a\nmad population vainly seeking a shelter among its ruins, while anxiously\nlooking for a solid and permanent refuge where they may begin life\nanew. You must not be surprised, then, at our discouragement and our\nimpatience. We can wait no longer. Since tardy science has failed in her\npromises, we prefer to fall back on the old beliefs, which for centuries\nhave sufficed for the happiness of the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! that is just it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he responded in a low voice; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe are just at the\nturning point, at the end of the century, fatigued and exhausted with\nthe appalling accumulation of knowledge which it has set moving. And it\nis the eternal need for falsehood, the eternal need for illusion which\ndistracts humanity, and throws it back upon the delusive charm of the\nunknown. Since we can never know all, what is the use of trying to know\nmore than we know already? Since the truth, when we have attained it,\ndoes not confer immediate and certain happiness, why not be satisfied\nwith ignorance, the darkened cradle in which humanity slept the deep\nsleep of infancy? Yes, this is the aggressive return of the mysterious,\nit is the reaction against a century of experimental research. And this\nhad to be; desertions were to be expected, since every need could not\nbe satisfied at once. But this is only a halt; the onward march will\ncontinue, up there, beyond our view, in the illimitable fields of\nspace.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor a moment they remained silent, still motionless on their backs,\ntheir gaze lost among the myriads of worlds shining in the dark sky. A\nfalling star shot across the constellation of Cassiopeia, like a flaming\narrow. And the luminous universe above turned slowly on its axis, in\nsolemn splendor, while from the dark earth around them arose only a\nfaint breath, like the soft, warm breath of a sleeping woman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, in his good-natured voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdid your Capuchin turn\nyour head this evening, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered frankly; \u00e2\u0080\u009che says from the pulpit things that\ndisturb me. He preaches against everything you have taught me, and it is\nas if the knowledge which I owe to you, transformed into a poison, were\nconsuming me. My God! What is going to become of me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy poor child! It is terrible that you should torture yourself in\nthis way! And yet I had been quite tranquil about you, for you have\na well-balanced mind--you have a good, little, round, clear, solid\nheadpiece, as I have often told you. You will soon calm down. But what\nconfusion in the brains of others, at the end of the century, if you,\nwho are so sane, are troubled! Have you not faith, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe answered only by a heavy sigh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAssuredly, viewed from the standpoint of happiness, faith is a strong\nstaff for the traveler to lean upon, and the march becomes easy and\ntranquil when one is fortunate enough to possess it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I no longer know whether I believe or not!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are\ndays when I believe, and there are other days when I side with you and\nwith your books. It is you who have disturbed me; it is through you I\nsuffer. And perhaps all my suffering springs from this, from my revolt\nagainst you whom I love. No, no! tell me nothing; do not tell me that I\nshall soon calm down. At this moment that would only irritate me still\nmore. I know well that you deny the supernatural. The mysterious for you\nis only the inexplicable. Even you concede that we shall never know all;\nand therefore you consider that the only interest life can have is the\ncontinual conquest over the unknown, the eternal effort to know more.\nAh, I know too much already to believe. You have already succeeded but\ntoo well in shaking my faith, and there are times when it seems to me\nthat this will kill me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe took her hand that lay on the still warm grass, and pressed it hard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no; it is life that frightens you, little girl. And how right you\nare in saying that happiness consists in continual effort. For from this\ntime forward tranquil ignorance is impossible. There is no halt to be\nlooked for, no tranquillity in renunciation and wilful blindness.\nWe must go on, go on in any case with life, which goes on always.\nEverything that is proposed, a return to the past, to dead religions,\npatched up religions arranged to suit new wants, is a snare. Learn to\nknow life, then; to love it, live it as it ought to be lived--that is\nthe only wisdom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut she shook off his hand angrily. And her voice trembled with\nvexation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLife is horrible. How do you wish me to live it tranquil and happy?\nIt is a terrible light that your science throws upon the world. Your\nanalysis opens up all the wounds of humanity to display their horror.\nYou tell everything; you speak too plainly; you leave us nothing but\ndisgust for people and for things, without any possible consolation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe interrupted her with a cry of ardent conviction.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe tell everything. Ah, yes; in order to know everything and to remedy\neverything!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHer anger rose, and she sat erect.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf even equality and justice existed in your nature--but you\nacknowledge it yourself, life is for the strongest, the weak infallibly\nperishes because he is weak--there are no two beings equal, either in\nhealth, in beauty, or intelligence; everything is left to haphazard\nmeeting, to the chance of selection. And everything falls into ruin,\nwhen grand and sacred justice ceases to exist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, in an undertone, as if speaking to himself,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is no such thing as equality. No society based upon it could\ncontinue to exist. For centuries, men thought to remedy evil by\ncharacter. But that idea is being exploded, and now they propose\njustice. Is nature just? I think her logical, rather. Logic is perhaps\na natural and higher justice, going straight to the sum of the common\nlabor, to the grand final labor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen it is justice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat crushes the individual for the\nhappiness of the race, that destroys an enfeebled species to fatten\nthe victorious species. No, no; that is crime. There is in that only\nfoulness and murder. He was right this evening in the church. The earth\nis corrupt, science only serves to show its rottenness. It is on high\nthat we must all seek a refuge. Oh, master, I entreat you, let me save\nmyself, let me save you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe burst into tears, and the sound of her sobs rose despairingly on\nthe stillness of the night. He tried in vain to soothe her, her voice\ndominated his.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen to me, master. You know that I love you, for you are everything\nto me. And it is you who are the cause of all my suffering. I can\nscarcely endure it when I think that we are not in accord, that we\nshould be separated forever if we were both to die to-morrow. Why will\nyou not believe?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe still tried to reason with her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be foolish, my dear--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut she threw herself on her knees, she seized him by the hands, she\nclung to him with a feverish force. And she sobbed louder and louder, in\nsuch a clamor of despair that the dark fields afar off were startled by\nit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen to me, he said it in the church. You must change your life and\ndo penance; you must burn everything belonging to your past errors--your\nbooks, your papers, your manuscripts. Make this sacrifice, master, I\nentreat it of you on my knees. And you will see the delightful existence\nwe shall lead together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt last he rebelled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, this is too much. Be silent!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you listen to me, master, you will do what I wish. I assure you\nthat I am horribly unhappy, even in loving you as I love you. There\nis something wanting in our affection. So far it has been profound but\nunavailing, and I have an irresistible longing to fill it, oh, with all\nthat is divine and eternal. What can be wanting to us but God? Kneel\ndown and pray with me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith an abrupt movement he released himself, angry in his turn.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe silent; you are talking nonsense. I have left you free, leave me\nfree.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster, master! it is our happiness that I desire! I will take you far,\nfar away. We will go to some solitude to live there in God!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe silent! No, never!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen they remained for a moment confronting each other, mute and\nmenacing. Around them stretched La Souleiade in the deep silence of the\nnight, with the light shadows of its olive trees, the darkness of its\npine and plane trees, in which the saddened voice of the fountain was\nsinging, and above their heads it seemed as if the spacious sky, studded\nwith stars, shuddered and grew pale, although the dawn was still far\noff.\n\nClotilde raised her arm as if to point to this infinite, shuddering sky;\nbut with a quick gesture Pascal seized her hand and drew it down toward\nthe earth in his. And no word further was spoken; they were beside\nthemselves with rage and hate. The quarrel was fierce and bitter.\n\nShe drew her hand away abruptly, and sprang backward, like some proud,\nuntamable animal, rearing; then she rushed quickly through the darkness\ntoward the house. He heard the patter of her little boots on the stones\nof the yard, deadened afterward by the sand of the walk. He, on his\nside, already grieved and uneasy, called her back in urgent tones. But\nshe ran on without answering, without hearing. Alarmed, and with a heavy\nheart, he hurried after her, and rounded the clump of plane trees just\nin time to see her rush into the house like a whirlwind. He darted in\nafter her, ran up the stairs, and struck against the door of her room,\nwhich she violently bolted. And here he stopped and grew calm, by a\nstrong effort resisting the desire to cry out, to call her again, to\nbreak in the door so as to see her once more, to convince her, to have\nher all to himself. For a moment he remained motionless, chilled by the\ndeathlike silence of the room, from which not the faintest sound issued.\nDoubtless she had thrown herself on the bed, and was stifling her cries\nand her sobs in the pillow. He determined at last to go downstairs\nagain and close the hall door, and then he returned softly and listened,\nwaiting for some sound of moaning. And day was breaking when he went\ndisconsolately to bed, choking back his tears.\n\nThenceforward it was war without mercy. Pascal felt himself spied upon,\ntrapped, menaced. He was no longer master of his house; he had no longer\nany home. The enemy was always there, forcing him to be constantly on\nhis guard, to lock up everything. One after the other, two vials of\nnerve-substance which he had compounded were found in fragments, and he\nwas obliged to barricade himself in his room, where he could be heard\npounding for days together, without showing himself even at mealtime.\nHe no longer took Clotilde with him on his visiting days, because she\ndiscouraged his patients by her attitude of aggressive incredulity. But\nfrom the moment he left the house, the doctor had only one desire--to\nreturn to it quickly, for he trembled lest he should find his locks\nforced, and his drawers rifled on his return. He no longer employed\nthe young girl to classify and copy his notes, for several of them had\ndisappeared, as if they had been carried away by the wind. He did not\neven venture to employ her to correct his proofs, having ascertained\nthat she had cut out of an article an entire passage, the sentiment of\nwhich offended her Catholic belief. And thus she remained idle, prowling\nabout the rooms, and having an abundance of time to watch for an\noccasion which would put in her possession the key of the large press.\nThis was her dream, the plan which she revolved in her mind during her\nlong silence, while her eyes shone and her hands burned with fever--to\nhave the key, to open the press, to take and burn everything in an\n_auto da fe_ which would be pleasing to God. A few pages of manuscript,\nforgotten by him on a corner of the table, while he went to wash his\nhands and put on his coat, had disappeared, leaving behind only a little\nheap of ashes in the fireplace. He could no longer leave a scrap of\npaper about. He carried away everything; he hid everything. One evening,\nwhen he had remained late with a patient, as he was returning home in\nthe dusk a wild terror seized him at the faubourg, at sight of a thick\nblack smoke rising up in clouds that darkened the heavens. Was it not\nLa Souleiade that was burning down, set on fire by the bonfire made with\nhis papers? He ran toward the house, and was reassured only on seeing in\na neighboring field a fire of roots burning slowly.\n\nBut how terrible are the tortures of the scientist who feels himself\nmenaced in this way in the labors of his intellect! The discoveries\nwhich he has made, the writings which he has counted upon leaving\nbehind him, these are his pride, they are creatures of his blood--his\nchildren--and whoever destroys, whoever burns them, burns a part of\nhimself. Especially, in this perpetual lying in wait for the creatures\nof his brain, was Pascal tortured by the thought that the enemy was in\nhis house, installed in his very heart, and that he loved her in spite\nof everything, this creature whom he had made what she was. He was left\ndisarmed, without possible defense; not wishing to act, and having\nno other resources than to watch with vigilance. On all sides the\ninvestment was closing around him. He fancied he felt the little\npilfering hands stealing into his pockets. He had no longer any\ntranquillity, even with the doors closed, for he feared that he was\nbeing robbed through the crevices.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, unhappy child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried one day, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI love but you in the world,\nand you are killing me! And yet you love me, too; you act in this way\nbecause you love me, and it is abominable. It would be better to have\ndone with it all at once, and throw ourselves into the river with a\nstone tied around our necks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did not answer, but her dauntless eyes said ardently that she would\nwillingly die on the instant, if it were with him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if I should suddenly die to-night, what would happen to-morrow?\nYou would empty the press, you would empty the drawers, you would make\na great heap of all my works and burn them! You would, would you not?\nDo you know that that would be a real murder, as much as if you\nassassinated some one? And what abominable cowardice, to kill the\nthoughts!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said at last, in a low voice; \u00e2\u0080\u009cto kill evil, to prevent it\nfrom spreading and springing up again!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAll their explanations only served to kindle anew their anger. And they\nhad terrible ones. And one evening, when old Mme. Rougon had chanced in\non one of these quarrels, she remained alone with Pascal, after Clotilde\nhad fled to hide herself in her room. There was silence for a moment. In\nspite of the heartbroken air which she had assumed, a wicked joy shone\nin the depths of her sparkling eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut your unhappy house is a hell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried at last.\n\nThe doctor avoided an answer by a gesture. He had always felt that his\nmother backed the young girl, inflaming her religious faith, utilizing\nthis ferment of revolt to bring trouble into his house. He was not\ndeceived. He knew perfectly well that the two women had seen each\nother during the day, and that he owed to this meeting, to a skilful\nembittering of Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind, the frightful scene at which he still\ntrembled. Doubtless his mother had come to learn what mischief had been\nwrought, and to see if the _denouement_ was not at last at hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThings cannot go on in this way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she resumed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy do you not separate\nsince you can no longer agree. You ought to send her to her brother\nMaxime. He wrote to me not long since asking her again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe straightened himself, pale and determined.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo part angry with each other? Ah, no, no! that would be an eternal\nremorse, an incurable wound. If she must one day go away, I wish that we\nmay be able to love each other at a distance. But why go away? Neither\nof us complains of the other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite felt that she had been too hasty. Therefore she assumed her\nhypocritical, conciliating air.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course, if it pleases you both to quarrel, no one has anything to\nsay in the matter. Only, my poor friend, permit me, in that case, to say\nthat I think Clotilde is not altogether in the wrong. You force me to\nconfess that I saw her a little while ago; yes, it is better that you\nshould know, notwithstanding my promise to be silent. Well, she is not\nhappy; she makes a great many complaints, and you may imagine that I\nscolded her and preached complete submission to her. But that does not\nprevent me from being unable to understand you myself, and from thinking\nthat you do everything you can to make yourself unhappy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe sat down in a corner of the room, and obliged him to sit down with\nher, seeming delighted to have him here alone, at her mercy. She had\nalready, more than once before, tried to force him to an explanation in\nthis way, but he had always avoided it. Although she had tortured\nhim for years past, and he knew her thoroughly, he yet remained\na deferential son, he had sworn never to abandon this stubbornly\nrespectful attitude. Thus, the moment she touched certain subjects, he\ntook refuge in absolute silence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can understand that you should not wish to\nyield to Clotilde; but to me? How if I were to entreat you to make me\nthe sacrifice of all those abominable papers which are there in the\npress! Consider for an instant if you should die suddenly, and those\npapers should fall into strange hands. We should all be disgraced. You\nwould not wish that, would you? What is your object, then? Why do you\npersist in so dangerous a game? Promise me that you will burn them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe remained silent for a time, but at last he answered:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother, I have already begged of you never to speak on that subject. I\ncannot do what you ask.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut at least,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgive me a reason. Any one would think our\nfamily was as indifferent to you as that drove of oxen passing below\nthere. Yet you belong to it. Oh, I know you do all you can not to belong\nto it! I myself am sometimes astonished at you. I ask myself where you\ncan have come from. But for all that, it is very wicked of you to run\nthis risk, without stopping to think of the grief you are causing to me,\nyour mother. It is simply wicked.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe grew still paler, and yielding for an instant to his desire to defend\nhimself, in spite of his determination to keep silent, he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are hard; you are wrong. I have always believed in the necessity,\nthe absolute efficacy of truth. It is true that I tell the truth about\nothers and about myself, and it is because I believe firmly that in\ntelling the truth I do the only good possible. In the first place, those\npapers are not intended for the public; they are only personal notes\nwhich it would be painful to me to part with. And then, I know well that\nyou would not burn only them--all my other works would also be thrown\ninto the fire. Would they not? And that is what I do not wish; do you\nunderstand? Never, while I live, shall a line of my writing be destroyed\nhere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut he already regretted having said so much, for he saw that she was\nurging him, leading him on to the cruel explanation she desired.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen finish, and tell me what it is that you reproach us with. Yes, me,\nfor instance; what do you reproach me with? Not with having brought you\nup with so much difficulty. Ah, fortune was slow to win! If we enjoy\na little happiness now, we have earned it hard. Since you have seen\neverything, and since you put down everything in your papers, you can\ntestify with truth that the family has rendered greater services to\nothers than it has ever received. On two occasions, but for us, Plassans\nwould have been in a fine pickle. And it is perfectly natural that we\nshould have reaped only ingratitude and envy, to the extent that even\nto-day the whole town would be enchanted with a scandal that should\nbespatter us with mud. You cannot wish that, and I am sure that you will\ndo justice to the dignity of my attitude since the fall of the Empire,\nand the misfortunes from which France will no doubt never recover.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet France rest, mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, speaking again, for she had touched\nthe spot where she knew he was most sensitive. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrance is tenacious of\nlife, and I think she is going to astonish the world by the rapidity of\nher convalescence. True, she has many elements of corruption. I have not\nsought to hide them, I have rather, perhaps, exposed them to view. But\nyou greatly misunderstand me if you imagine that I believe in her final\ndissolution, because I point out her wounds and her lesions. I believe\nin the life which ceaselessly eliminates hurtful substances, which makes\nnew flesh to fill the holes eaten away by gangrene, which infallibly\nadvances toward health, toward constant renovation, amid impurities and\ndeath.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was growing excited, and he was conscious of it, and making an angry\ngesture, he spoke no more. His mother had recourse to tears, a few\nlittle tears which came with difficulty, and which were quickly dried.\nAnd the fears which saddened her old age returned to her, and she\nentreated him to make his peace with God, if only out of regard for the\nfamily. Had she not given an example of courage ever since the downfall\nof the Empire? Did not all Plassans, the quarter of St. Marc, the\nold quarter and the new town, render homage to the noble attitude she\nmaintained in her fall? All she asked was to be helped; she demanded\nfrom all her children an effort like her own. Thus she cited the example\nof Eugene, the great man who had fallen from so lofty a height, and who\nresigned himself to being a simple deputy, defending until his latest\nbreath the fallen government from which he had derived his glory. She\nwas also full of eulogies of Aristide, who had never lost hope, who had\nreconquered, under the new government, an exalted position, in spite of\nthe terrible and unjust catastrophe which had for a moment buried him\nunder the ruins of the Union Universelle. And would he, Pascal, hold\nhimself aloof, would he do nothing that she might die in peace, in the\njoy of the final triumph of the Rougons, he who was so intelligent, so\naffectionate, so good? He would go to mass, would he not, next Sunday?\nand he would burn all those vile papers, only to think of which made\nher ill. She entreated, commanded, threatened. But he no longer answered\nher, calm and invincible in his attitude of perfect deference. He wished\nto have no discussion. He knew her too well either to hope to convince\nher or to venture to discuss the past with her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, when she saw that he was not to be moved, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou do not\nbelong to us. I have always said so. You are a disgrace to us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe bent his head and said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother, when you reflect you will forgive me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOn this day Felicite was beside herself with rage when she went away;\nand when she met Martine at the door of the house, in front of the plane\ntrees, she unburdened her mind to her, without knowing that Pascal, who\nhad just gone into his room, heard all. She gave vent to her resentment,\nvowing, in spite of everything, that she would in the end succeed in\nobtaining possession of the papers and destroying them, since he did\nnot wish to make the sacrifice. But what turned the doctor cold was\nthe manner in which Martine, in a subdued voice, soothed her. She was\nevidently her accomplice. She repeated that it was necessary to wait;\nnot to do anything hastily; that mademoiselle and she had taken a vow to\nget the better of monsieur, by not leaving him an hour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s peace. They had\nsworn it. They would reconcile him with the good God, because it was\nnot possible that an upright man like monsieur should remain without\nreligion. And the voices of the two women became lower and lower, until\nthey finally sank to a whisper, an indistinct murmur of gossiping and\nplotting, of which he caught only a word here and there; orders given,\nmeasures to be taken, an invasion of his personal liberty. When his\nmother at last departed, with her light step and slender, youthful\nfigure, he saw that she went away very well satisfied.\n\nThen came a moment of weakness, of utter despair. Pascal dropped into a\nchair, and asked himself what was the use of struggling, since the only\nbeings he loved allied themselves against him. Martine, who would have\nthrown herself into the fire at a word from him, betraying him in this\nway for his good! And Clotilde leagued with this servant, plotting with\nher against him in holes and corners, seeking her aid to set traps for\nhim! Now he was indeed alone; he had around him only traitresses, who\npoisoned the very air he breathed. But these two still loved him. He\nmight perhaps have succeeded in softening them, but when he knew that\nhis mother urged them on, he understood their fierce persistence, and\nhe gave up the hope of winning them back. With the timidity of a man\nwho had spent his life in study, aloof from women, notwithstanding\nhis secret passion, the thought that they were there to oppose him, to\nattempt to bend him to their will, overwhelmed him. He felt that some\none of them was always behind him. Even when he shut himself up in his\nroom, he fancied that they were on the other side of the wall; and\nhe was constantly haunted by the idea that they would rob him of his\nthought, if they could perceive it in his brain, before he should have\nformulated it.\n\nThis was assuredly the period in his life in which Dr. Pascal was most\nunhappy. To live constantly on the defensive, as he was obliged to do,\ncrushed him, and it seemed to him as if the ground on which his house\nstood was no longer his, as if it was receding from beneath his feet.\nHe now regretted keenly that he had not married, and that he had no\nchildren. Had not he himself been afraid of life? And had he not been\nwell punished for his selfishness? This regret for not having children\nnow never left him. His eyes now filled with tears whenever he met on\nthe road bright-eyed little girls who smiled at him. True, Clotilde was\nthere, but his affection for her was of a different kind--crossed at\npresent by storms--not a calm, infinitely sweet affection, like that for\na child with which he might have soothed his lacerated heart. And then,\nno doubt what he desired in his isolation, feeling that his days were\ndrawing to an end, was above all, continuance; in a child he would\nsurvive, he would live forever. The more he suffered, the greater the\nconsolation he would have found in bequeathing this suffering, in the\nfaith which he still had in life. He considered himself indemnified\nfor the physiological defects of his family. But even the thought that\nheredity sometimes passes over a generation, and that the disorders of\nhis ancestors might reappear in a child of his did not deter him; and\nthis unknown child, in spite of the old corrupt stock, in spite of the\nlong succession of execrable relations, he desired ardently at certain\ntimes: as one desires unexpected gain, rare happiness, the stroke of\nfortune which is to console and enrich forever. In the shock which his\nother affections had received, his heart bled because it was too late.\n\nOne sultry night toward the end of September, Pascal found himself\nunable to sleep. He opened one of the windows of his room; the sky\nwas dark, some storm must be passing in the distance, for there was a\ncontinuous rumbling of thunder. He could distinguish vaguely the dark\nmass of the plane trees, which occasional flashes of lightning detached,\nin a dull green, from the darkness. His soul was full of anguish; he\nlived over again the last unhappy days, days of fresh quarrels, of\ntorture caused by acts of treachery, by suspicions, which grew stronger\nevery day, when a sudden recollection made him start. In his fear of\nbeing robbed, he had finally adopted the plan of carrying the key of the\nlarge press in his pocket. But this afternoon, oppressed by the heat, he\nhad taken off his jacket, and he remembered having seen Clotilde hang\nit up on a nail in the study. A sudden pang of terror shot through him,\nsharp and cold as a steel point; if she had felt the key in the pocket\nshe had stolen it. He hastened to search the jacket which he had a\nlittle before thrown upon a chair; the key was not here. At this very\nmoment he was being robbed; he had the clear conviction of it. Two\no\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock struck. He did not again dress himself, but, remaining in his\ntrousers only, with his bare feet thrust into slippers, his chest bare\nunder his unfastened nightshirt, he hastily pushed open the door, and\nrushed into the workroom, his candle in his hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! I knew it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThief! Assassin!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was true; Clotilde was there, undressed like himself, her bare feet\ncovered by canvas slippers, her legs bare, her arms bare, her shoulders\nbare, clad only in her chemise and a short skirt. Through caution, she\nhad not brought a candle. She had contented herself with opening one of\nthe window shutters, and the continual lightning flashes of the storm\nwhich was passing southward in the dark sky, sufficed her, bathing\neverything in a livid phosphorescence. The old press, with its broad\nsides, was wide open. Already she had emptied the top shelf, taking down\nthe papers in armfuls, and throwing them on the long table in the middle\nof the room, where they lay in a confused heap. And with feverish haste,\nfearing lest she should not have the time to burn them, she was making\nthem up into bundles, intending to hide them, and send them afterward\nto her grandmother, when the sudden flare of the candle, lighting up\nthe room, caused her to stop short in an attitude of surprise and\nresistance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou rob me; you assassinate me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated Pascal furiously.\n\nShe still held one of the bundles in her bare arms. He wished to take\nit away from her, but she pressed it to her with all her strength,\nobstinately resolved upon her work of destruction, without showing\nconfusion or repentance, like a combatant who has right upon his side.\nThen, madly, blindly, he threw himself upon her, and they struggled\ntogether. He clutched her bare flesh so that he hurt her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKill me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she gasped. \u00e2\u0080\u009cKill me, or I shall destroy everything!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe held her close to him, with so rough a grasp that she could scarcely\nbreathe, crying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen a child steals, it is punished!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA few drops of blood appeared and trickled down her rounded shoulder,\nwhere an abrasion had cut the delicate satin skin. And, on the instant,\nseeing her so breathless, so divine, in her virginal slender height,\nwith her tapering limbs, her supple arms, her slim body with its\nslender, firm throat, he released her. By a last effort he tore the\npackage from her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you shall help me to put them all up there again, by Heaven! Come\nhere: begin by arranging them on the table. Obey me, do you hear?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, master!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe approached, and helped him to arrange the papers, subjugated,\ncrushed by this masculine grasp, which had entered into her flesh, as it\nwere. The candle which flared up in the heavy night air, lighted them;\nand the distant rolling of the thunder still continued, the window\nfacing the storm seeming on fire.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\nFor an instant Pascal looked at the papers, the heap of which seemed\nenormous, lying thus in disorder on the long table that stood in the\nmiddle of the room. In the confusion several of the blue paper envelopes\nhad burst open, and their contents had fallen out--letters, newspaper\nclippings, documents on stamped paper, and manuscript notes.\n\nHe was already mechanically beginning to seek out the names written on\nthe envelopes in large characters, to classify the packages again, when,\nwith an abrupt gesture, he emerged from the somber meditation into which\nhe had fallen. And turning to Clotilde who stood waiting, pale, silent,\nand erect, he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen to me; I have always forbidden you to read these papers, and I\nknow that you have obeyed me. Yes, I had scruples of delicacy. It is not\nthat you are an ignorant girl, like so many others, for I have allowed\nyou to learn everything concerning man and woman, which is assuredly bad\nonly for bad natures. But to what end disclose to you too early these\nterrible truths of human life? I have therefore spared you the history\nof our family, which is the history of every family, of all humanity; a\ngreat deal of evil and a great deal of good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe paused as if to confirm himself in his resolution and then resumed\nquite calmly and with supreme energy:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are twenty-five years old; you ought to know. And then the life we\nare leading is no longer possible. You live and you make me live in a\nconstant nightmare, with your ecstatic dreams. I prefer to show you the\nreality, however execrable it may be. Perhaps the blow which it will\ninflict upon you will make of you the woman you ought to be. We will\nclassify these papers again together, and read them, and learn from them\na terrible lesson of life!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, as she still continued motionless, he resumed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, we must be able to see well. Light those other two candles\nthere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was seized by a desire for light, a flood of light; he would have\ndesired the blinding light of the sun; and thinking that the light of\nthe three candles was not sufficient, he went into his room for a pair\nof three-branched candelabra which were there. The nine candles were\nblazing, yet neither of them, in their disorder--he with his chest\nbare, she with her left shoulder stained with blood, her throat and arms\nbare--saw the other. It was past two o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, but neither of them had\nany consciousness of the hour; they were going to spend the night in\nthis eager desire for knowledge, without feeling the need of sleep,\noutside time and space. The mutterings of the storm, which, through the\nopen window, they could see gathering, grew louder and louder.\n\nClotilde had never before seen in Pascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes the feverish light which\nburned in them now. He had been overworking himself for some time past,\nand his mental sufferings made him at times abrupt, in spite of his\ngood-natured complacency. But it seemed as if an infinite tenderness,\ntrembling with fraternal pity, awoke within him, now that he was about\nto plunge into the painful truths of existence; and it was something\nemanating from himself, something very great and very good which was to\nrender innocuous the terrible avalanche of facts which was impending. He\nwas determined that he would reveal everything, since it was necessary\nthat he should do so in order to remedy everything. Was not this an\nunanswerable, a final argument for evolution, the story of these beings\nwho were so near to them? Such was life, and it must be lived. Doubtless\nshe would emerge from it like the steel tempered by the fire, full of\ntolerance and courage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are setting you against me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he resumed; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey are making you\ncommit abominable acts, and I wish to restore your conscience to you.\nWhen you know, you will judge and you will act. Come here, and read with\nme.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe obeyed. But these papers, about which her grandmother had spoken so\nangrily, frightened her a little; while a curiosity that grew with\nevery moment awoke within her. And then, dominated though she was by the\nvirile authority which had just constrained and subjugated her, she did\nnot yet yield. But might she not listen to him, read with him? Did she\nnot retain the right to refuse or to give herself afterward? He spoke at\nlast.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you come?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, master, I will.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe showed her first the genealogical tree of the Rougon-Macquarts. He\ndid not usually lock it in the press, but kept it in the desk in his\nroom, from which he had taken it when he went there for the candelabra.\nFor more than twenty years past he had kept it up to date, inscribing\nthe births, deaths, marriages, and other important events that had taken\nplace in the family, making brief notes in each case, in accordance with\nhis theory of heredity.\n\nIt was a large sheet of paper, yellow with age, with folds cut by wear,\non which was drawn boldly a symbolical tree, whose branches spread and\nsubdivided into five rows of broad leaves; and each leaf bore a name,\nand contained, in minute handwriting, a biography, a hereditary case.\n\nA scientist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s joy took possession of the doctor at sight of this labor\nof twenty years, in which the laws of heredity established by him were\nso clearly and so completely applied.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, child! You know enough about the matter, you have copied enough\nof my notes to understand. Is it not beautiful? A document so complete,\nso conclusive, in which there is not a gap? It is like an experiment\nmade in the laboratory, a problem stated and solved on the blackboard.\nYou see below, the trunk, the common stock, Aunt Dide; then the three\nbranches issuing from it, the legitimate branch, Pierre Rougon, and the\ntwo illegitimate branches, Ursule Macquart and Antoine Macquart; then,\nnew branches arise, and ramify, on one side, Maxime, Clotilde, and\nVictor, the three children of Saccard, and Angelique, the daughter of\nSidonie Rougon; on the other, Pauline, the daughter of Lisa Macquart,\nand Claude, Jacques, Etienne, and Anna, the four children of Gervaise,\nher sister; there, at the extremity, is Jean, their brother, and here in\nthe middle, you see what I call the knot, the legitimate issue and the\nillegitimate issue, uniting in Marthe Rougon and her cousin Francois\nMouret, to give rise to three new branches, Octave, Serge, and Desiree\nMouret; while there is also the issue of Ursule and the hatter Mouret;\nSilvere, whose tragic death you know; Helene and her daughter Jean;\nfinally, at the top are the latest offshoots, our poor Charles, your\nbrother Maxime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son, and two other children, who are dead, Jacques\nLouis, the son of Claude Lantier, and Louiset, the son of Anna Coupeau.\nIn all five generations, a human tree which, for five springs already,\nfive springtides of humanity, has sent forth shoots, at the impulse of\nthe sap of eternal life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe became more and more animated, pointing out each case on the sheet of\nold yellow paper, as if it were an anatomical chart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd as I have already said, everything is here. You see in direct\nheredity, the differentiations, that of the mother, Silvere, Lisa,\nDesiree, Jacques, Louiset, yourself; that of the father, Sidonie,\nFrancois, Gervaise, Octave, Jacques, Louis. Then there are the three\ncases of crossing: by conjugation, Ursule, Aristide, Anna, Victor;\nby dissemination, Maxime, Serge, Etienne; by fusion, Antoine, Eugene,\nClaude. I even noted a fourth case, a very remarkable one, an\neven cross, Pierre and Pauline; and varieties are established, the\ndifferentiation of the mother, for example, often accords with the\nphysical resemblance of the father; or, it is the contrary which takes\nplace, so that, in the crossing, the physical and mental predominance\nremains with one parent or the other, according to circumstances. Then\nhere is indirect heredity, that of the collateral branches. I have but\none well established example of this, the striking personal resemblance\nof Octave Mouret to his uncle Eugene Rougon. I have also but one\nexample of transmission by influence, Anna, the daughter of Gervaise and\nCoupeau, who bore a striking resemblance, especially in her childhood,\nto Lantier, her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first lover. But what I am very rich in is in\nexamples of reversion to the original stock--the three finest cases,\nMarthe, Jeanne, and Charles, resembling Aunt Dide; the resemblance\nthus passing over one, two, and three generations. This is certainly\nexceptional, for I scarcely believe in atavism; it seems to me that\nthe new elements brought by the partners, accidents, and the infinite\nvariety of crossings must rapidly efface particular characteristics, so\nas to bring back the individual to the general type. And there remains\nvariation--Helene, Jean, Angelique. This is the combination, the\nchemical mixture in which the physical and mental characteristics of the\nparents are blended, without any of their traits seeming to reappear in\nthe new being.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was silence for a moment. Clotilde had listened to him with\nprofound attention, wishing to understand. And he remained absorbed in\nthought, his eyes still fixed on the tree, in the desire to judge his\nwork impartially. He then continued in a low tone, as if speaking to\nhimself:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, that is as scientific as possible. I have placed there only the\nmembers of the family, and I had to give an equal part to the partners,\nto the fathers and mothers come from outside, whose blood has mingled\nwith ours, and therefore modified it. I had indeed made a mathematically\nexact tree, the father and the mother bequeathing themselves, by halves,\nto the child, from generation to generation, so that in Charles, for\nexample, Aunt Dide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part would have been only a twelfth--which would\nbe absurd, since the physical resemblance is there complete. I have\ntherefore thought it sufficient to indicate the elements come from\nelsewhere, taking into account marriages and the new factor which each\nintroduced. Ah! these sciences that are yet in their infancy, in which\nhypothesis speaks stammeringly, and imagination rules, these are the\ndomain of the poet as much as of the scientist. Poets go as pioneers\nin the advance guard, and they often discover new countries, suggesting\nsolutions. There is there a borderland which belongs to them, between\nthe conquered, the definitive truth, and the unknown, whence the\ntruth of to-morrow will be torn. What an immense fresco there is to be\npainted, what a stupendous human tragedy, what a comedy there is to\nbe written with heredity, which is the very genesis of families, of\nsocieties, and of the world!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis eyes fixed on vacancy, he remained for a time lost in thought. Then,\nwith an abrupt movement, he came back to the envelopes and, pushing the\ntree aside, said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will take it up again presently; for, in order that you may\nunderstand now, it is necessary that events should pass in review before\nyou, and that you should see in action all these actors ticketed here,\neach one summed up in a brief note. I will call for the envelopes, you\nwill hand them to me one by one, and I will show you the papers in each,\nand tell you their contents, before putting it away again up there on\nthe shelf. I will not follow the alphabetical order, but the order of\nevents themselves. I have long wished to make this classification. Come,\nlook for the names on the envelopes; Aunt Dide first.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this moment the edge of the storm which lighted up the sky caught La\nSouleiade slantingly, and burst over the house in a deluge of rain.\nBut they did not even close the window. They heard neither the peals of\nthunder nor the ceaseless beating of the rain upon the roof. She handed\nhim the envelope bearing the name of Aunt Dide in large characters; and\nhe took from it papers of all sorts, notes taken by him long ago, which\nhe proceeded to read.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHand me Pierre Rougon. Hand me Ursule Macquart. Hand me Antoine\nMacquart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSilently she obeyed him, her heart oppressed by a dreadful anguish at\nall she was hearing. And the envelopes were passed on, displayed their\ncontents, and were piled up again in the press.\n\nFirst was the foundress of the family, Adelaide Fouque, the tall, crazy\ngirl, the first nervous lesion giving rise to the legitimate branch,\nPierre Rougon, and to the two illegitimate branches, Ursule and Antoine\nMacquart, all that _bourgeois_ and sanguinary tragedy, with the _coup\nd\u00e2\u0080\u0099etat_ of December, 1854, for a background, the Rougons, Pierre and\nFelicite, preserving order at Plassans, bespattering with the blood of\nSilvere their rising fortunes, while Adelaide, grown old, the miserable\nAunt Dide, was shut up in the Tulettes, like a specter of expiation and\nof waiting.\n\nThen like a pack of hounds, the appetites were let loose. The supreme\nappetite of power in Eugene Rougon, the great man, the disdainful genius\nof the family, free from base interests, loving power for its own sake,\nconquering Paris in old boots with the adventurers of the coming\nEmpire, rising from the legislative body to the senate, passing from the\npresidency of the council of state to the portfolio of minister; made by\nhis party, a hungry crowd of followers, who at the same time supported\nand devoured him; conquered for an instant by a woman, the beautiful\nClorinde, with whom he had been imbecile enough to fall in love, but\nhaving so strong a will, and burning with so vehement a desire to rule,\nthat he won back power by giving the lie to his whole life, marching to\nhis triumphal sovereignty of vice emperor.\n\nWith Aristide Saccard, appetite ran to low pleasures, the whole hot\nquarry of money, luxury, women--a devouring hunger which left him\nhomeless, at the time when millions were changing hands, when the\nwhirlwind of wild speculation was blowing through the city, tearing\ndown everywhere to construct anew, when princely fortunes were made,\nsquandered, and remade in six months; a greed of gold whose ever\nincreasing fury carried him away, causing him, almost before the body\nof his wife Angele was cold in death, to sell his name, in order to have\nthe first indispensable thousand francs, by marrying Renee. And it\nwas Saccard, too, who, a few years later, put in motion the immense\nmoney-press of the Banque Universelle. Saccard, the never vanquished;\nSaccard, grown more powerful, risen to be the clever and daring grand\nfinancier, comprehending the fierce and civilizing role that money\nplays, fighting, winning, and losing battles on the Bourse, like\nNapoleon at Austerlitz and Waterloo; engulfing in disaster a world of\nmiserable people; sending forth into the unknown realms of crime his\nnatural son Victor, who disappeared, fleeing through the dark night,\nwhile he himself, under the impassable protection of unjust nature, was\nloved by the adorable Mme. Caroline, no doubt in recompense of all the\nevil he had done.\n\nHere a tall, spotless lily had bloomed in this compost, Sidonie Rougon,\nthe sycophant of her brother, the go-between in a hundred suspicious\naffairs, giving birth to the pure and divine Angelique, the little\nembroiderer with fairylike fingers who worked into the gold of\nthe chasubles the dream of her Prince Charming, so happy among her\ncompanions the saints, so little made for the hard realities of\nlife, that she obtained the grace of dying of love, on the day of her\nmarriage, at the first kiss of Felicien de Hautecoeur, in the triumphant\npeal of bells ringing for her splendid nuptials.\n\nThe union of the two branches, the legitimate and the illegitimate,\ntook place then, Marthe Rougon espousing her cousin Francois Mouret,\na peaceful household slowly disunited, ending in the direst\ncatastrophes--a sad and gentle woman taken, made use of, and crushed in\nthe vast machine of war erected for the conquest of a city; her three\nchildren torn from her, she herself leaving her heart in the rude grasp\nof the Abbe Faujas. And the Rougons saved Plassans a second time, while\nshe was dying in the glare of the conflagration in which her husband was\nbeing consumed, mad with long pent-up rage and the desire for revenge.\n\nOf the three children, Octave Mouret was the audacious conqueror, the\nclear intellect, resolved to demand from the women the sovereignty of\nParis, fallen at his _debut_ into the midst of a corrupt _bourgeois_\nsociety, acquiring there a terrible sentimental education, passing from\nthe capricious refusal of one woman to the unresisting abandonment\nof another, remaining, fortunately, active, laborious, and combative,\ngradually emerging, and improved even, from the low plotting, the\nceaseless ferment of a rotten society that could be heard already\ncracking to its foundations. And Octave Mouret, victorious,\nrevolutionized commerce; swallowed up the cautious little shops that\ncarried on business in the old-fashioned way; established in the midst\nof feverish Paris the colossal palace of temptation, blazing with\nlights, overflowing with velvets, silks, and laces; won fortunes\nexploiting woman; lived in smiling scorn of woman until the day when\na little girl, the avenger of her sex, the innocent and wise Denise,\nvanquished him and held him captive at her feet, groaning with anguish,\nuntil she did him the favor, she who was so poor, to marry him in the\nmidst of the apotheosis of his Louvre, under the golden shower of his\nreceipts.\n\nThere remained the two other children, Serge Mouret and Desiree Mouret,\nthe latter innocent and healthy, like some happy young animal; the\nformer refined and mystical, who was thrown into the priesthood by a\nnervous malady hereditary in his family, and who lived again the story\nof Adam, in the Eden of Le Paradou. He was born again to love Albine,\nand to lose her, in the bosom of sublime nature, their accomplice; to be\nrecovered, afterward by the Church, to war eternally with life, striving\nto kill his manhood, throwing on the body of the dead Albine the handful\nof earth, as officiating priest, at the very time when Desiree, the\nsister and friend of animals, was rejoicing in the midst of the swarming\nlife of her poultry yard.\n\nFurther on there opened a calm glimpse of gentle and tragic life, Helene\nMouret living peacefully with her little girl, Jeanne, on the heights of\nPassy, overlooking Paris, the bottomless, boundless human sea, in face\nof which was unrolled this page of love: the sudden passion of Helene\nfor a stranger, a physician, brought one night by chance to the bedside\nof her daughter; the morbid jealousy of Jeanne--the instinctive jealousy\nof a loving girl--disputing her mother with love, her mother already\nso wasted by her unhappy passion that the daughter died because of\nher fault; terrible price of one hour of desire in the entire cold and\ndiscreet life of a woman, poor dead child, lying alone in the silent\ncemetery, in face of eternal Paris.\n\nWith Lisa Macquart began the illegitimate branch; appearing fresh and\nstrong in her, as she displayed her portly, prosperous figure, sitting\nat the door of her pork shop in a light colored apron, watching the\ncentral market, where the hunger of a people muttered, the age-long\nbattle of the Fat and the Lean, the lean Florent, her brother-in-law,\nexecrated, and set upon by the fat fishwomen and the fat shopwomen, and\nwhom even the fat pork-seller herself, honest, but unforgiving, caused\nto be arrested as a republican who had broken his ban, convinced that\nshe was laboring for the good digestion of all honest people.\n\nFrom this mother sprang the sanest, the most human of girls, Pauline\nQuenu, the well-balanced, the reasonable, the virgin; who, knowing\neverything, accepted the joy of living in so ardent a love for others\nthat, in spite of the revolt of her youthful heart, she resigned to her\nfriend her cousin and betrothed, Lazare, and afterward saved the child\nof the disunited household, becoming its true mother; always triumphant,\nalways gay, notwithstanding her sacrificed and ruined life, in her\nmonotonous solitude, facing the great sea, in the midst of a little\nworld of sufferers groaning with pain, but who did not wish to die.\n\nThen came Gervaise Macquart with her four children: bandy-legged,\npretty, and industrious Gervaise, whom her lover Lantier turned into\nthe street in the faubourg, where she met the zinc worker Coupeau, the\nskilful, steady workman whom she married, and with whom she lived\nso happily at first, having three women working in her laundry,\nbut afterward sinking with her husband, as was inevitable, to the\ndegradation of her surroundings. He, gradually conquered by alcohol,\nbrought by it to madness and death; she herself perverted, become a\nslattern, her moral ruin completed by the return of Lantier, living\nin the tranquil ignominy of a household of three, thenceforward the\nwretched victim of want, her accomplice, to which she at last succumbed,\ndying one night of starvation.\n\nHer eldest son, Claude, had the unhappy genius of a great painter struck\nwith madness, the impotent madness of feeling within him the masterpiece\nto which his fingers refused to give shape; a giant wrestler always\ndefeated, a crucified martyr to his work, adoring woman, sacrificing his\nwife Christine, so loving and for a time so beloved, to the increate,\ndivine woman of his visions, but whom his pencil was unable to delineate\nin her nude perfection, possessed by a devouring passion for producing,\nan insatiable longing to create, a longing so torturing when it could\nnot be satisfied, that he ended it by hanging himself.\n\nJacques brought crime, the hereditary taint being transmuted in him into\nan instinctive appetite for blood, the young and fresh blood from the\ngashed throat of a woman, the first comer, the passer-by in the street:\na horrible malady against which he struggled, but which took possession\nof him again in the course of his _amour_ with the submissive and\nsensual Severine, whom a tragic story of assassination caused to live in\nconstant terror, and whom he stabbed one evening in an excess of frenzy,\nmaddened by the sight of her white throat. Then this savage human beast\nrushed among the trains filing past swiftly, and mounted the snorting\nengine of which he was the engineer, the beloved engine which was one\nday to crush him to atoms, and then, left without a guide, to rush\nfuriously off into space braving unknown disasters.\n\nEtienne, in his turn driven out, arrived in the black country on a\nfreezing night in March, descended into the voracious pit, fell in love\nwith the melancholy Catherine, of whom a ruffian robbed him; lived with\nthe miners their gloomy life of misery and base promiscuousness, until\none day when hunger, prompting rebellion, sent across the barren plain a\nhowling mob of wretches who demanded bread, tearing down and burning\nas they went, under the menace of the guns of the band that went off of\nthemselves, a terrible convulsion announcing the end of the world. The\navenging blood of the Maheus was to rise up later; of Alzire dead of\nstarvation, Maheu killed by a bullet, Zacharie killed by an explosion of\nfire-damp, Catherine under the ground. La Maheude alone survived to weep\nher dead, descending again into the mine to earn her thirty sons, while\nEtienne, the beaten chief of the band, haunted by the dread of future\ndemands, went away on a warm April morning, listening to the secret\ngrowth of the new world whose germination was soon to dazzle the earth.\n\nNana then became the avenger; the girl born among the social filth of\nthe faubourgs; the golden fly sprung from the rottenness below, that\nwas tolerated and concealed, carrying in the fluttering of its wings\nthe ferment of destruction, rising and contaminating the aristocracy,\npoisoning men only by alighting upon them, in the palaces through whose\nwindows it entered; the unconscious instrument of ruin and death--fierce\nflame of Vandeuvres, the melancholy fate of Foucarmont, lost in the\nChinese waters, the disaster of Steiner, reduced to live as an honest\nman, the imbecility of La Faloise and the tragic ruin of the Muffats,\nand the white corpse of Georges, watched by Philippe, come out of prison\nthe day before, when the air of the epoch was so contaminated that she\nherself was infected, and died of malignant smallpox, caught at the\ndeath-bed of her son Louiset, while Paris passed beneath her windows,\nintoxicated, possessed by the frenzy of war, rushing to general ruin.\n\nLastly comes Jean Macquart, the workman and soldier become again a\npeasant, fighting with the hard earth, which exacts that every grain of\ncorn shall be purchased with a drop of sweat, fighting, above all, with\nthe country people, whom covetousness and the long and difficult battle\nwith the soil cause to burn with the desire, incessantly stimulated, of\npossession. Witness the Fouans, grown old, parting with their fields as\nif they were parting with their flesh; the Buteaus in their eager greed\ncommitting parricide, to hasten the inheritance of a field of lucern;\nthe stubborn Francoise dying from the stroke of a scythe, without\nspeaking, rather than that a sod should go out of the family--all this\ndrama of simple natures governed by instinct, scarcely emerged from\nprimitive barbarism--all this human filth on the great earth, which\nalone remains immortal, the mother from whom they issue and to whom they\nreturn again, she whom they love even to crime, who continually remakes\nlife, for its unknown end, even with the misery and the abomination of\nthe beings she nourishes. And it was Jean, too, who, become a widower\nand having enlisted again at the first rumor of war, brought the\ninexhaustible reserve, the stock of eternal rejuvenation which the earth\nkeeps; Jean, the humblest, the staunchest soldier at the final downfall,\nswept along in the terrible and fatal storm which, from the frontier\nto Sedan, in sweeping away the Empire, threatened to sweep away the\ncountry; always wise, circumspect, firm in his hope, loving with\nfraternal affection his comrade Maurice, the demented child of the\npeople, the holocaust doomed to expiation, weeping tears of blood when\ninexorable destiny chose himself to hew off this rotten limb, and after\nall had ended--the continual defeats, the frightful civil war, the lost\nprovinces, the thousands of millions of francs to pay--taking up the\nmarch again, notwithstanding, returning to the land which awaited him,\nto the great and difficult task of making a new France.\n\nPascal paused; Clotilde had handed him all the packages, one by one,\nand he had gone over them all, laid bare the contents of all, classified\nthem anew, and placed them again on the top shelf of the press. He was\nout of breath, exhausted by his swift course through all this humanity,\nwhile, without voice, without movement, the young girl, stunned by\nthis overflowing torrent of life, waited still, incapable of thought\nor judgment. The rain still beat furiously upon the dark fields. The\nlightning had just struck a tree in the neighborhood, that had split\nwith a terrible crash. The candles flared up in the wind that came in\nfrom the open window.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he resumed, pointing to the papers again, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is a world in\nitself, a society, a civilization, the whole of life is there, with its\nmanifestations, good and bad, in the heat and labor of the forge which\nshapes everything. Yes, our family of itself would suffice as an example\nto science, which will perhaps one day establish with mathematical\nexactness the laws governing the diseases of the blood and nerves\nthat show themselves in a race, after a first organic lesion, and\nthat determine, according to environment, the sentiments, desires, and\npassions of each individual of that race, all the human, natural and\ninstinctive manifestations which take the names of virtues and vices.\nAnd it is also a historical document, it relates the story of the Second\nEmpire, from the _coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099etat_ to Sedan; for our family spring from\nthe people, they spread themselves through the whole of contemporary\nsociety, invaded every place, impelled by their unbridled appetites, by\nthat impulse, essentially modern, that eager desire that urges the lower\nclasses to enjoyment, in their ascent through the social strata. We\nstarted, as I have said, from Plassans, and here we are now arrived once\nmore at Plassans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe paused again, and then resumed in a low, dreamy voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat an appalling mass stirred up! how many passions, how many joys,\nhow many sufferings crammed into this colossal heap of facts! There is\npure history: the Empire founded in blood, at first pleasure-loving\nand despotic, conquering rebellious cities, then gliding to a slow\ndisintegration, dissolving in blood--in such a sea of blood that the\nentire nation came near being swamped in it. There are social studies:\nwholesale and retail trade, prostitution, crime, land, money, the\n_bourgeoisie_, the people--that people who rot in the sewer of\nthe faubourgs, who rebel in the great industrial centers, all that\never-increasing growth of mighty socialism, big with the new century.\nThere are simple human studies: domestic pages, love stories, the\nstruggle of minds and hearts against unjust nature, the destruction\nof those who cry out under their too difficult task, the cry of virtue\nimmolating itself, victorious over pain, There are fancies, flights\nof the imagination beyond the real: vast gardens always in bloom,\ncathedrals with slender, exquisitely wrought spires, marvelous tales\ncome down from paradise, ideal affections remounting to heaven in a\nkiss. There is everything: the good and the bad, the vulgar and the\nsublime, flowers, mud, blood, laughter, the torrent of life itself,\nbearing humanity endlessly on!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe took up again the genealogical tree which had remained neglected\non the table, spread it out and began to go over it once more with his\nfinger, enumerating now the members of the family who were still living:\nEugene Rougon, a fallen majesty, who remained in the Chamber, the\nwitness, the impassible defender of the old world swept away at the\ndownfall of the Empire. Aristide Saccard, who, after having changed his\nprinciples, had fallen upon his feet a republican, the editor of a great\njournal, on the way to make new millions, while his natural son Victor,\nwho had never reappeared, was living still in the shade, since he was\nnot in the galleys, cast forth by the world into the future, into the\nunknown, like a human beast foaming with the hereditary virus, who must\ncommunicate his malady with every bite he gives. Sidonie Rougon, who\nhad for a time disappeared, weary of disreputable affairs, had lately\nretired to a sort of religious house, where she was living in monastic\nausterity, the treasurer of the Marriage Fund, for aiding in the\nmarriage of girls who were mothers. Octave Mouret, proprietor of the\ngreat establishment _Au Bonheur des Dames_, whose colossal fortune still\ncontinued increasing, had had, toward the end of the winter, a third\nchild by his wife Denise Baudu, whom he adored, although his mind was\nbeginning to be deranged again. The Abbe Mouret, cure at St. Eutrope, in\nthe heart of a marshy gorge, lived there in great retirement, and very\nmodestly, with his sister Desiree, refusing all advancement from his\nbishop, and waiting for death like a holy man, rejecting all medicines,\nalthough he was already suffering from consumption in its first stage.\nHelene Mouret was living very happily in seclusion with her second\nhusband, M. Rambaud, on the little estate which they owned near\nMarseilles, on the seashore; she had had no child by her second husband.\nPauline Quenu was still at Bonneville at the other extremity of France,\nin face of the vast ocean, alone with little Paul, since the death\nof Uncle Chanteau, having resolved never to marry, in order to devote\nherself entirely to the son of her cousin Lazare, who had become a\nwidower and had gone to America to make a fortune. Etienne Lantier,\nreturning to Paris after the strike at Montsou, had compromised himself\nlater in the insurrection of the Commune, whose principles he had\ndefended with ardor; he had been condemned to death, but his sentence\nbeing commuted was transported and was now at Noumea. It was even said\nthat he had married immediately on his arrival there, and that he had\nhad a child, the sex of which, however, was not known with certainty.\nFinally, Jean Macquart, who had received his discharge after the Bloody\nWeek, had settled at Valqueyras, near Plassans, where he had had the\ngood fortune to marry a healthy girl, Melanie Vial, the daughter of a\nwell-to-do peasant, whose lands he farmed, and his wife had borne him a\nson in May.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, it is true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he resumed, in a low voice; \u00e2\u0080\u009craces degenerate. There\nis here a veritable exhaustion, rapid deterioration, as if our family,\nin their fury of enjoyment, in the gluttonous satisfaction of their\nappetites, had consumed themselves too quickly. Louiset, dead in\ninfancy; Jacques Louis, a half imbecile, carried off by a nervous\ndisease; Victor returned to the savage state, wandering about in who\nknows what dark places; our poor Charles, so beautiful and so frail;\nthese are the latest branches of the tree, the last pale offshoots into\nwhich the puissant sap of the larger branches seems to have been unable\nto mount. The worm was in the trunk, it has ascended into the fruit, and\nis devouring it. But one must never despair; families are a continual\ngrowth. They go back beyond the common ancestor, into the unfathomable\nstrata of the races that have lived, to the first being; and they\nwill put forth new shoots without end, they will spread and ramify to\ninfinity, through future ages. Look at our tree; it counts only five\ngenerations. It has not so much importance as a blade of grass, even,\nin the human forest, vast and dark, of which the peoples are the great\nsecular oaks. Think only of the immense roots which spread through the\nsoil; think of the continual putting forth of new leaves above, which\nmingle with other leaves of the ever-rolling sea of treetops, at the\nfructifying, eternal breath of life. Well, hope lies there, in the daily\nreconstruction of the race by the new blood which comes from without.\nEach marriage brings other elements, good or bad, of which the effect\nis, however, to prevent certain and progressive regeneration.\nBreaches are repaired, faults effaced, an equilibrium is inevitably\nre-established at the end of a few generations, and it is the average\nman that always results; vague humanity, obstinately pursuing its\nmysterious labor, marching toward its unknown end.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe paused, and heaved a deep sigh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! our family, what is it going to become; in what being will it\nfinally end?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe continued, not now taking into account the survivors whom he had just\nnamed; having classified these, he knew what they were capable of, but\nhe was full of keen curiosity regarding the children who were\nstill infants. He had written to a _confrere_ in Noumea for precise\ninformation regarding the wife whom Etienne had lately married there,\nand the child which she had had, but he had heard nothing, and he feared\ngreatly that on that side the tree would remain incomplete. He was more\nfully furnished with documents regarding the two children of Octave\nMouret, with whom he continued to correspond; the little girl was\ngrowing up puny and delicate, while the little boy, who strongly\nresembled his mother, had developed superbly, and was perfectly healthy.\nHis strongest hope, besides these, was in Jean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s children, the eldest of\nwhom was a magnificent boy, full of the youthful vigor of the races that\ngo back to the soil to regenerate themselves. Pascal occasionally went\nto Valqueyras, and he returned happy from that fertile spot, where the\nfather, quiet and rational, was always at his plow, the mother cheerful\nand simple, with her vigorous frame, capable of bearing a world. Who\nknew what sound branch was to spring from that side? Perhaps the wise\nand puissant of the future were to germinate there. The worst of it, for\nthe beauty of his tree, was that all these little boys and girls were\nstill so young that he could not classify them. And his voice grew\ntender as he spoke of this hope of the future, these fair-haired\nchildren, in the unavowed regret for his celibacy.\n\nStill contemplating the tree spread out before him, he cried:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd yet it is complete, it is decisive. Look! I repeat to you that all\nhereditary cases are to be found there. To establish my theory, I\nhad only to base it on the collection of these facts. And indeed, the\nmarvelous thing is that there you can put your finger on the cause\nwhy creatures born of the same stock can appear radically different,\nalthough they are only logical modifications of common ancestors. The\ntrunk explains the branches, and these explain the leaves. In your\nfather Saccard and your Uncle Eugene Rougon, so different in their\ntemperaments and their lives, it is the same impulse which made the\ninordinate appetites of the one and the towering ambition of the other.\nAngelique, that pure lily, is born from the disreputable Sidonie, in the\nrapture which makes mystics or lovers, according to the environment. The\nthree children of the Mourets are born of the same breath which makes of\nthe clever Octave the dry goods merchant, a millionaire; of the devout\nSerge, a poor country priest; of the imbecile Desiree, a beautiful and\nhappy girl. But the example is still more striking in the children of\nGervaise; the neurosis passes down, and Nana sells herself; Etienne is\na rebel; Jacques, a murderer; Claude, a genius; while Pauline, their\ncousin german, near by, is victorious virtue--virtue which struggles\nand immolates itself. It is heredity, life itself which makes imbeciles,\nmadmen, criminals and great men. Cells abort, others take their place,\nand we have a scoundrel or a madman instead of a man of genius, or\nsimply an honest man. And humanity rolls on, bearing everything on its\ntide.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen in a new shifting of his thought, growing still more animated, he\ncontinued:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd animals--the beast that suffers and that loves, which is the rough\nsketch, as it were, of man--all the animals our brothers, that live our\nlife, yes, I would have put them in the ark, I would give them a place\namong our family, show them continually mingling with us, completing our\nexistence. I have known cats whose presence was the mysterious charm of\nthe household; dogs that were adored, whose death was mourned, and left\nin the heart an inconsolable grief. I have known goats, cows, and asses\nof very great importance, and whose personality played such a part that\ntheir history ought to be written. And there is our Bonhomme, our poor\nold horse, that has served us for a quarter of a century. Do you not\nthink that he has mingled his life with ours, and that henceforth he\nis one of the family? We have modified him, as he has influenced us a\nlittle; we shall end by being made in the same image, and this is so\ntrue that now, when I see him, half blind, with wandering gaze, his legs\nstiff with rheumatism, I kiss him on both cheeks as if he were a poor\nold relation who had fallen to my charge. Ah, animals, all creeping and\ncrawling things, all creatures that lament, below man, how large a place\nin our sympathies it would be necessary to give them in a history of\nlife!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was a last cry in which Pascal gave utterance to his passionate\ntenderness for all created beings. He had gradually become more and more\nexcited, and had so come to make this confession of his faith in the\ncontinuous and victorious work of animated nature. And Clotilde, who\nthus far had not spoken, pale from the catastrophe in which her plans\nhad ended, at last opened her lips to ask:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, master, and what am I here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe placed one of her slender fingers on the leaf of the tree on\nwhich she saw her name written. He had always passed this leaf by. She\ninsisted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I; what am I? Why have you not read me my envelope?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor a moment he remained silent, as if surprised at the question.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy? For no reason. It is true, I have nothing to conceal from you.\nYou see what is written here? \u00e2\u0080\u0098Clotilde, born in 1847. Selection of the\nmother. Reversional heredity, with moral and physical predominance\nof the maternal grandfather.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Nothing can be clearer. Your mother has\npredominated in you; you have her fine intelligence, and you have\nalso something of her coquetry, at times of her indolence and of her\nsubmissiveness. Yes, you are very feminine, like her. Without your being\naware of it, I would say that you love to be loved. Besides, your mother\nwas a great novel reader, an imaginative being who loved to spend whole\ndays dreaming over a book; she doted on nursery tales, had her fortune\ntold by cards, consulted clairvoyants; and I have always thought that\nyour concern about spiritual matters, your anxiety about the unknown,\ncame from that source. But what completed your character by giving you a\ndual nature, was the influence of your grandfather, Commandant Sicardot.\nI knew him; he was not a genius, but he had at least a great deal\nof uprightness and energy. Frankly, if it were not for him, I do not\nbelieve that you would be worth much, for the other influences\nare hardly good. He has given you the best part of your nature,\ncombativeness, pride, and frankness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe had listened to him with attention. She nodded slightly, to signify\nthat it was indeed so, that she was not offended, although her lips\ntrembled visibly at these new details regarding her people and her\nmother.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she resumed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand you, master?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis time he did not hesitate.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat is the use of speaking of me? I do not belong\nto the family. You see what is written here. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Pascal, born in 1813.\nIndividual variation. Combination in which the physical and moral\ncharacters of the parents are blended, without any of their traits\nseeming to appear in the new being.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 My mother has told me often enough\nthat I did not belong to it, that in truth she did not know where I\ncould have come from.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThose words came from him like a cry of relief, of involuntary joy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the people make no mistake in the matter. Have you ever heard\nme called Pascal Rougon in the town? No; people always say simply Dr.\nPascal. It is because I stand apart. And it may not be very affectionate\nto feel so, but I am delighted at it, for there are in truth\ninheritances too heavy to bear. It is of no use that I love them all.\nMy heart beats none the less joyously when I feel myself another being,\ndifferent from them, without any community with them. Not to be of them,\nmy God! not to be of them! It is a breath of pure air; it is what\ngives me the courage to have them all here, to put them, in all their\nnakedness, in their envelopes, and still to find the courage to live!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe stopped, and there was silence for a time. The rain had ceased, the\nstorm was passing away, the thunderclaps sounded more and more distant,\nwhile from the refreshed fields, still dark, there came in through the\nopen window a delicious odor of moist earth. In the calm air the candles\nwere burning out with a tall, tranquil flame.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Clotilde simply, with a gesture of discouragement, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat are\nwe to become finally?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe had declared it to herself one night, in the threshing yard; life\nwas horrible, how could one live peaceful and happy? It was a terrible\nlight that science threw on the world. Analysis searched every wound\nof humanity, in order to expose its horror. And now he had spoken still\nmore bluntly; he had increased the disgust which she had for persons and\nthings, pitilessly dissecting her family. The muddy torrent had rolled\non before her for nearly three hours, and she had heard the most\ndreadful revelations, the harsh and terrible truth about her people, her\npeople who were so dear to her, whom it was her duty to love; her father\ngrown powerful through pecuniary crimes; her brother dissolute; her\ngrandmother unscrupulous, covered with the blood of the just; the\nothers almost all tainted, drunkards, ruffians, murderers, the monstrous\nblossoming of the human tree.\n\nThe blow had been so rude that she could not yet recover from it,\nstunned as she was by the revelation of her whole family history,\nmade to her in this way at a stroke. And yet the lesson was rendered\ninnocuous, so to say, by something great and good, a breath of profound\nhumanity which had borne her through it. Nothing bad had come to her\nfrom it. She felt herself beaten by a sharp sea wind, the storm wind\nwhich strengthens and expands the lungs. He had revealed everything,\nspeaking freely even of his mother, without judging her, continuing to\npreserve toward her his deferential attitude, as a scientist who does\nnot judge events. To tell everything in order to know everything, in\norder to remedy everything, was not this the cry which he had uttered on\nthat beautiful summer night?\n\nAnd by the very excess of what he had just revealed to her, she remained\nshaken, blinded by this too strong light, but understanding him at last,\nand confessing to herself that he was attempting in this an immense\nwork. In spite of everything, it was a cry of health, of hope in the\nfuture. He spoke as a benefactor who, since heredity made the world,\nwished to fix its laws, in order to control it, and to make a new and\nhappy world. Was there then only mud in this overflowing stream, whose\nsluices he had opened? How much gold had passed, mingled with the grass\nand the flowers on its borders? Hundreds of beings were still flying\nswiftly before her, and she was haunted by good and charming faces,\ndelicate girlish profiles, by the serene beauty of women. All passion\nbled there, hearts swelled with every tender rapture. They were\nnumerous, the Jeannes, the Angeliques, the Paulines, the Marthes, the\nGervaises, the Helenes. They and others, even those who were least good,\neven terrible men, the worst of the band, showed a brotherhood with\nhumanity.\n\nAnd it was precisely this breath which she had felt pass, this broad\ncurrent of sympathy, that he had introduced naturally into his exact\nscientific lesson. He did not seem to be moved; he preserved the\nimpersonal and correct attitude of the demonstrator, but within him\nwhat tender suffering, what a fever of devotion, what a giving up of\nhis whole being to the happiness of others? His entire work, constructed\nwith such mathematical precision, was steeped in this fraternal\nsuffering, even in its most cruel ironies. Had he not just spoken of\nthe animals, like an elder brother of the wretched living beings that\nsuffer? Suffering exasperated him; his wrath was because of his\ntoo lofty dream, and he had become harsh only in his hatred of the\nfactitious and the transitory; dreaming of working, not for the polite\nsociety of a time, but for all humanity in the gravest hours of its\nhistory. Perhaps, even, it was this revolt against the vulgarity of the\ntime which had made him throw himself, in bold defiance, into theories\nand their application. And the work remained human, overflowing as it\nwas with an infinite pity for beings and things.\n\nBesides, was it not life? There is no absolute evil. Most often a virtue\npresents itself side by side with a defect. No man is bad to every one,\neach man makes the happiness of some one; so that, when one does not\nview things from a single standpoint only, one recognizes in the end\nthe utility of every human being. Those who believe in God should say\nto themselves that if their God does not strike the wicked dead, it is\nbecause he sees his work in its totality, and that he cannot descend\nto the individual. Labor ends to begin anew; the living, as a whole,\ncontinue, in spite of everything, admirable in their courage and their\nindustry; and love of life prevails over all.\n\nThis giant labor of men, this obstinacy in living, is their excuse,\nis redemption. And then, from a great height the eye saw only this\ncontinual struggle, and a great deal of good, in spite of everything,\neven though there might be a great deal of evil. One shared the general\nindulgence, one pardoned, one had only an infinite pity and an ardent\ncharity. The haven was surely there, waiting those who have lost faith\nin dogmas, who wish to understand the meaning of their lives, in the\nmidst of the apparent iniquity of the world. One must live for the\neffort of living, for the stone to be carried to the distant and unknown\nwork, and the only possible peace in the world is in the joy of making\nthis effort.\n\nAnother hour passed; the entire night had flown by in this terrible\nlesson of life, without either Pascal or Clotilde being conscious of\nwhere they were, or of the flight of time. And he, overworked for some\ntime past, and worn out by the life of suspicion and sadness which he\nhad been leading, started nervously, as if he had suddenly awakened.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, you know all; do you feel your heart strong, tempered by the\ntruth, full of pardon and of hope? Are you with me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut, still stunned by the frightful moral shock which she had received,\nshe too, started, bewildered. Her old beliefs had been so completely\noverthrown, so many new ideas were awakening within her, that she did\nnot dare to question herself, in order to find an answer. She felt\nherself seized and carried away by the omnipotence of truth. She endured\nit without being convinced.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she stammered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaster--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd they remained for a moment face to face, looking at each other. Day\nwas breaking, a dawn of exquisite purity, far off in the vast, clear\nsky, washed by the storm. Not a cloud now stained the pale azure tinged\nwith rose color. All the cheerful sounds of awakening life in the\nrain-drenched fields came in through the window, while the candles,\nburned down to the socket, paled in the growing light.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnswer; are you with me, altogether with me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor a moment he thought she was going to throw herself on his neck and\nburst into tears. A sudden impulse seemed to impel her. But they saw\neach other in their semi-nudity. She, who had not noticed it before, was\nnow conscious that she was only half dressed, that her arms were bare,\nher shoulders bare, covered only by the scattered locks of her unbound\nhair, and on her right shoulder, near the armpit, on lowering her eyes,\nshe perceived again the few drops of blood of the bruise which he had\ngiven her, when he had grasped her roughly, in struggling to master her.\nThen an extraordinary confusion took possession of her, a certainty that\nshe was going to be vanquished, as if by this grasp he had become her\nmaster, and forever. This sensation was prolonged; she was seized and\ndrawn on, without the consent of her will, by an irresistible impulse to\nsubmit.\n\nAbruptly Clotilde straightened herself, struggling with herself, wishing\nto reflect and to recover herself. She pressed her bare arms against\nher naked throat. All the blood in her body rushed to her skin in a rosy\nblush of shame. Then, in her divine and slender grace, she turned to\nflee.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster, master, let me go--I will see--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith the swiftness of alarmed maidenhood, she took refuge in her\nchamber, as she had done once before. He heard her lock the door\nhastily, with a double turn of the key. He remained alone, and he asked\nhimself suddenly, seized by infinite discouragement and sadness, if he\nhad done right in speaking, if the truth would germinate in this dear\nand adored creature, and bear one day a harvest of happiness.\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\nThe days wore on. October began with magnificent weather--a sultry\nautumn in which the fervid heat of summer was prolonged, with a\ncloudless sky. Then the weather changed, fierce winds began to blow, and\na last storm channeled gullies in the hillsides. And to the melancholy\nhousehold at La Souleiade the approach of winter seemed to have brought\nan infinite sadness.\n\nIt was a new hell. There were no more violent quarrels between Pascal\nand Clotilde. The doors were no longer slammed. Voices raised in dispute\nno longer obliged Martine to go continually upstairs to listen outside\nthe door. They scarcely spoke to each other now; and not a single word\nhad been exchanged between them regarding the midnight scene, although\nweeks had passed since it had taken place. He, through an inexplicable\nscruple, a strange delicacy of which he was not himself conscious, did\nnot wish to renew the conversation, and to demand the answer which he\nexpected--a promise of faith in him and of submission. She, after the\ngreat moral shock which had completely transformed her, still reflected,\nhesitated, struggled, fighting against herself, putting off her decision\nin order not to surrender, in her instinctive rebelliousness. And the\nmisunderstanding continued, in the midst of the mournful silence of the\nmiserable house, where there was no longer any happiness.\n\nDuring all this time Pascal suffered terribly, without making any\ncomplaint. He had sunk into a dull distrust, imagining that he was still\nbeing watched, and that if they seemed to leave him at peace it was\nonly in order to concoct in secret the darkest plots. His uneasiness\nincreased, even, and he expected every day some catastrophe to\nhappen--the earth suddenly to open and swallow up his papers, La\nSouleiade itself to be razed to the ground, carried away bodily,\nscattered to the winds.\n\nThe persecution against his thought, against his moral and intellectual\nlife, in thus hiding itself, and so rendering him helpless to defend\nhimself, became so intolerable to him that he went to bed every night in\na fever. He would often start and turn round suddenly, thinking he\nwas going to surprise the enemy behind him engaged in some piece of\ntreachery, to find nothing there but the shadow of his own fears. At\nother times, seized by some suspicion, he would remain on the watch\nfor hours together, hidden, behind his blinds, or lying in wait in\na passage; but not a soul stirred, he heard nothing but the violent\nbeating of his heart. His fears kept him in a state of constant\nagitation; he never went to bed at night without visiting every room;\nhe no longer slept, or, if he did, he would waken with a start at the\nslightest noise, ready to defend himself.\n\nAnd what still further aggravated Pascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sufferings was the constant,\nthe ever more bitter thought that the wound was inflicted upon him by\nthe only creature he loved in the world, the adored Clotilde, whom for\ntwenty years he had seen grow in beauty and in grace, whose life had\nhitherto bloomed like a beautiful flower, perfuming his. She, great God!\nfor whom his heart was full of affection, whom he had never analyzed,\nshe, who had become his joy, his courage, his hope, in whose young life\nhe lived over again. When she passed by, with her delicate neck, so\nround, so fresh, he was invigorated, bathed in health and joy, as at the\ncoming of spring.\n\nHis whole life, besides, explained this invasion, this subjugation of\nhis being by the young girl who had entered into his heart while she\nwas still a little child, and who, as she grew up, had gradually taken\npossession of the whole place. Since he had settled at Plassans, he had\nled a blest existence, wrapped up in his books, far from women. The only\npassion he was ever known to have had, was his love for the lady who had\ndied, whose finger tips he had never kissed. He had not lived; he had\nwithin him a reserve of youthfulness, of vigor, whose surging flood now\nclamored rebelliously at the menace of approaching age. He would have\nbecome attached to an animal, a stray dog that he had chanced to pick up\nin the street, and that had licked his hand. And it was this child whom\nhe loved, all at once become an adorable woman, who now distracted him,\nwho tortured him by her hostility.\n\nPascal, so gay, so kind, now became insupportably gloomy and harsh. He\ngrew angry at the slightest word; he would push aside the astonished\nMartine, who would look up at him with the submissive eyes of a beaten\nanimal. From morning till night he went about the gloomy house, carrying\nhis misery about with him, with so forbidding a countenance that no one\nventured to speak to him.\n\nHe never took Clotilde with him now on his visits, but went alone. And\nthus it was that he returned home one afternoon, his mind distracted\nbecause of an accident which had happened; having on his conscience, as\na physician, the death of a man.\n\nHe had gone to give a hypodermic injection to Lafouasse, the tavern\nkeeper, whose ataxia had within a short time made such rapid progress\nthat he regarded him as doomed. But, notwithstanding, Pascal still\nfought obstinately against the disease, continuing the treatment, and as\nill luck would have it, on this day the little syringe had caught up at\nthe bottom of the vial an impure particle, which had escaped the filter.\nImmediately a drop of blood appeared; to complete his misfortune, he had\npunctured a vein. He was at once alarmed, seeing the tavern keeper turn\npale and gasp for breath, while large drops of cold perspiration broke\nout upon his face. Then he understood; death came as if by a stroke of\nlightning, the lips turning blue, the face black. It was an embolism;\nhe had nothing to blame but the insufficiency of his preparations, his\nstill rude method. No doubt Lafouasse had been doomed. He could\nnot, perhaps, have lived six months longer, and that in the midst of\natrocious sufferings, but the brutal fact of this terrible death was\nnone the less there, and what despairing regret, what rage against\nimpotent and murderous science, and what a shock to his faith! He\nreturned home, livid, and did not make his appearance again until the\nfollowing day, after having remained sixteen hours shut up in his room,\nlying in a semi-stupor on the bed, across which he had thrown himself,\ndressed as he was.\n\nOn the afternoon of this day Clotilde, who was sitting beside him in the\nstudy, sewing, ventured to break the oppressive silence. She looked up,\nand saw him turning over the leaves of a book wearily, searching for\nsome information which he was unable to find.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster, are you ill? Why do you not tell me, if you are. I would take\ncare of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe kept his eyes bent upon the book, and muttered:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat does it matter to you whether I am ill or not? I need no one to\ntake care of me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe resumed, in a conciliating voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you have troubles, and can tell them to me, it would perhaps be a\nrelief to you to do so. Yesterday you came in looking so sad. You must\nnot allow yourself to be cast down in that way. I have spent a very\nanxious night. I came to your door three times to listen, tormented by\nthe idea that you were suffering.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGently as she spoke, her words were like the cut of a whip. In his weak\nand nervous condition a sudden access of rage made him push away the\nbook and rise up trembling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you spy upon me, then. I cannot even retire to my room without\npeople coming to glue their ears to the walls. Yes, you listen even to\nthe beatings of my heart. You watch for my death, to pillage and burn\neverything here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis voice rose and all his unjust suffering vented itself in complaints\nand threats.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI forbid you to occupy yourself about me. Is there nothing else that\nyou have to say to me? Have you reflected? Can you put your hand in mine\nloyally, and say to me that we are in accord?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did not answer. She only continued to look at him with her large\nclear eyes, frankly declaring that she would not surrender yet, while\nhe, exasperated more and more by this attitude, lost all self-control.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo away, go away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he stammered, pointing to the door. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not wish\nyou to remain near me. I do not wish to have enemies near me. I do not\nwish you to remain near me to drive me mad!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe rose, very pale, and went at once out of the room, without looking\nbehind, carrying her work with her.\n\nDuring the month which followed, Pascal took refuge in furious and\nincessant work. He now remained obstinately, for whole days at a time,\nalone in the study, sometimes passing even the nights there, going over\nold documents, to revise all his works on heredity. It seemed as if a\nsort of frenzy had seized him to assure himself of the legitimacy of his\nhopes, to force science to give him the certainty that humanity could be\nremade--made a higher, a healthy humanity. He no longer left the house,\nhe abandoned his patients even, and lived among his papers, without air\nor exercise. And after a month of this overwork, which exhausted him\nwithout appeasing his domestic torments, he fell into such a state of\nnervous exhaustion that illness, for some time latent, declared itself\nat last with alarming violence.\n\nPascal, when he rose in the morning, felt worn out with fatigue, wearier\nand less refreshed than he had been on going to bed the night before. He\nconstantly had pains all over his body; his limbs failed him, after\nfive minutes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 walk; the slightest exertion tired him; the least movement\ncaused him intense pain. At times the floor seemed suddenly to sway\nbeneath his feet. He had a constant buzzing in his ears, flashes of\nlight dazzled his eyes. He took a loathing for wine, he had no longer\nany appetite, and his digestion was seriously impaired. Then, in the\nmidst of the apathy of his constantly increasing idleness he would have\nsudden fits of aimless activity. The equilibrium was destroyed, he\nhad at times outbreaks of nervous irritability, without any cause. The\nslightest emotion brought tears to his eyes. Finally, he would shut\nhimself up in his room, and give way to paroxysms of despair so violent\nthat he would sob for hours at a time, without any immediate cause of\ngrief, overwhelmed simply by the immense sadness of things.\n\nIn the early part of December Pascal had a severe attack of neuralgia.\nViolent pains in the bones of the skull made him feel at times as if his\nhead must split. Old Mme. Rougon, who had been informed of his illness,\ncame to inquire after her son. But she went straight to the kitchen,\nwishing to have a talk with Martine first. The latter, with a\nheart-broken and terrified air, said to her that monsieur must certainly\nbe going mad; and she told her of his singular behavior, the continual\ntramping about in his room, the locking of all the drawers, the rounds\nwhich he made from the top to the bottom of the house, until two o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock\nin the morning. Tears filled her eyes and she at last hazarded the\nopinion that monsieur must be possessed with a devil, and that it would\nbe well to notify the cure of St. Saturnin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo good a man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca man for whom one would let one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self be\ncut in pieces! How unfortunate it is that one cannot get him to go to\nchurch, for that would certainly cure him at once.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde, who had heard her grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice, entered at this moment.\nShe, too, wandered through the empty rooms, spending most of her time in\nthe deserted apartment on the ground floor. She did not speak, however,\nbut only listened with her thoughtful and expectant air.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, goodday! It is you, my dear. Martine tells me that Pascal is\npossessed with a devil. That is indeed my opinion also; only the devil\nis called pride. He thinks that he knows everything. He is Pope and\nEmperor in one, and naturally it exasperates him when people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree\nwith him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders with supreme disdain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs for me, all that would only make me laugh if it were not so sad. A\nfellow who knows nothing about anything; who has always been wrapped up\nin his books; who has not lived. Put him in a drawing-room, and he would\nknow as little how to act as a new-born babe. And as for women, he does\nnot even know what they are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nForgetting to whom she was speaking, a young girl and a servant, she\nlowered her voice, and said confidentially:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, one pays for being too sensible, too. Neither a wife nor a\nsweetheart nor anything. That is what has finally turned his brain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde did not move. She only lowered her eyelids slowly over her\nlarge thoughtful eyes; then she raised them again, maintaining her\nimpenetrable countenance, unwilling, unable, perhaps, to give expression\nto what was passing within her. This was no doubt all still confused, a\ncomplete evolution, a great change which was taking place, and which she\nherself did not clearly understand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is upstairs, is he not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed Felicite. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have come to see him,\nfor this must end; it is too stupid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she went upstairs, while Martine returned to her saucepans, and\nClotilde went to wander again through the empty house.\n\nUpstairs in the study Pascal sat seemingly in a stupor, his face bent\nover a large open book. He could no longer read, the words danced before\nhis eyes, conveying no meaning to his mind. But he persisted, for it\nwas death to him to lose his faculty for work, hitherto so powerful.\nHis mother at once began to scold him, snatching the book from him,\nand flinging it upon a distant table, crying that when one was sick one\nshould take care of one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self. He rose with a quick, angry movement,\nabout to order her away as he had ordered Clotilde. Then, by a last\neffort of the will, he became again deferential.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother, you know that I have never wished to dispute with you. Leave\nme, I beg of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did not heed him, but began instead to take him to task about his\ncontinual distrust. It was he himself who had given himself a fever,\nalways fancying that he was surrounded by enemies who were setting traps\nfor him, and watching him to rob him. Was there any common sense in\nimagining that people were persecuting him in that way? And then she\naccused him of allowing his head to be turned by his discovery, his\nfamous remedy for curing every disease. That was as much as to think\nhimself equal to the good God; which only made it all the more cruel\nwhen he found out how mistaken he was. And she mentioned Lafouasse, the\nman whom he had killed--naturally, she could understand that that had\nnot been very pleasant for him; indeed there was cause enough in it to\nmake him take to his bed.\n\nPascal, still controlling himself, very pale and with eyes cast on the\nground, contented himself with repeating:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother, leave me, I beg of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried with the impetuosity which was\nnatural to her, and which her great age had in no wise diminished. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nhave come precisely to stir you up a little, to rid you of this fever\nwhich is consuming you. No, this cannot continue. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wish that we\nshould again become the talk of the whole town on your account. I wish\nyou to take care of yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders, and said in a low voice, as if speaking to\nhimself, with an uneasy look, half of conviction, half of doubt:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not ill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Felicite, beside herself, burst out, gesticulating violently:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot ill! not ill! Truly, there is no one like a physician for not being\nable to see himself. Why, my poor boy, every one that comes near you is\nshocked by your appearance. You are becoming insane through pride and\nfear!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis time Pascal raised his head quickly, and looked her straight in the\neyes, while she continued:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is what I had to tell you, since it seems that no one else would\nundertake the task. You are old enough to know what you ought to do.\nYou should make an effort to shake off all this; you should think of\nsomething else; you should not let a fixed idea take possession of you,\nespecially when you belong to a family like ours. You know it; have\nsense, and take care of yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe grew paler than before, looking fixedly at her still, as if he were\nsounding her, to know what there was of her in him. And he contented\nhimself with answering:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are right, mother. I thank you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen he was again alone, he dropped into his seat before the table, and\ntried once more to read his book. But he could not succeed, any more\nthan before, in fixing his attention sufficiently to understand the\nwords, whose letters mingled confusedly together before his eyes. And\nhis mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words buzzed in his ears; a vague terror, which had some\ntime before sprung up within him, grew and took shape, haunting him now\nas an immediate and clearly defined danger. He who two months before\nhad boasted triumphantly of not belonging to the family, was he about\nto receive the most terrible of contradictions? Ah, this egotistic joy,\nthis intense joy of not belonging to it, was it to give place to\nthe terrible anguish of being struck in his turn? Was he to have the\nhumiliation of seeing the taint revive in him? Was he to be dragged\ndown to the horror of feeling himself in the clutches of the monster\nof heredity? The sublime idea, the lofty certitude which he had of\nabolishing suffering, of strengthening man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s will, of making a new and a\nhigher humanity, a healthy humanity, was assuredly only the beginning of\nthe monomania of vanity. And in his bitter complaint of being watched,\nin his desire to watch the enemies who, he thought, were obstinately\nbent on his destruction, were easily to be recognized the symptoms of\nthe monomania of suspicion. So then all the diseases of the race were\nto end in this terrible case--madness within a brief space, then general\nparalysis, and a dreadful death.\n\nFrom this day forth Pascal was as if possessed. The state of nervous\nexhaustion into which overwork and anxiety had thrown him left him an\nunresisting prey to this haunting fear of madness and death. All the\nmorbid sensations which he felt, his excessive fatigue on rising, the\nbuzzing in his ears, the flashes of light before his eyes, even\nhis attacks of indigestion and his paroxysms of tears, were so many\ninfallible symptoms of the near insanity with which he believed himself\nthreatened. He had completely lost, in his own case, the keen power\nof diagnosis of the observant physician, and if he still continued to\nreason about it, it was only to confound and pervert symptoms, under the\ninfluence of the moral and physical depression into which he had fallen.\nHe was no longer master of himself; he was mad, so to say, to convince\nhimself hour by hour that he must become so.\n\nAll the days of this pale December were spent by him in going deeper\nand deeper into his malady. Every morning he tried to escape from the\nhaunting subject, but he invariably ended by shutting himself in the\nstudy to take up again, in spite of himself, the tangled skein of the\nday before.\n\nThe long study which he had made of heredity, his important researches,\nhis works, completed the poisoning of his peace, furnishing him with\never renewed causes of disquietude. To the question which he put to\nhimself continually as to his own hereditary case, the documents were\nthere to answer it by all possible combinations. They were so numerous\nthat he lost himself among them now. If he had deceived himself, if he\ncould not set himself apart, as a remarkable case of variation, should\nhe place himself under the head of reversional heredity, passing\nover one, two, or even three generations? Or was his case rather a\nmanifestation of larvated heredity, which would bring anew proof to the\nsupport of his theory of the germ plasm, or was it simply a singular\ncase of hereditary resemblance, the sudden apparition of some unknown\nancestor at the very decline of life?\n\nFrom this moment he never rested, giving himself up completely to the\ninvestigation of his case, searching his notes, rereading his books. And\nhe studied himself, watching the least of his sensations, to deduce from\nthem the facts on which he might judge himself. On the days when his\nmind was most sluggish, or when he thought he experienced particular\nphenomena of vision, he inclined to a predominance of the original\nnervous lesion; while, if he felt that his limbs were affected, his feet\nheavy and painful, he imagined he was suffering the indirect influence\nof some ancestor come from outside. Everything became confused, until at\nlast he could recognize himself no longer, in the midst of the imaginary\ntroubles which agitated his disturbed organism. And every evening the\nconclusion was the same, the same knell sounded in his brain--heredity,\nappalling heredity, the fear of becoming mad.\n\nIn the early part of January Clotilde was an involuntary spectator of a\nscene which wrung her heart. She was sitting before one of the windows\nof the study, reading, concealed by the high back of her chair, when\nshe saw Pascal, who had been shut up in his room since the day before,\nentering. He held open before his eyes with both hands a sheet of\nyellow paper, in which she recognized the genealogical tree. He was so\ncompletely absorbed, his gaze was so fixed, that she might have come\nforward without his observing her. He spread the tree upon the table,\ncontinuing to look at it for a long time, with the terrified expression\nof interrogation which had become habitual to him, which gradually\nchanged to one of supplication, the tears coursing down his cheeks.\n\nWhy, great God! would not the tree answer him, and tell him what\nancestor he resembled, in order that he might inscribe his case on his\nown leaf, beside the others? If he was to become mad, why did not the\ntree tell him so clearly, which would have calmed him, for he believed\nthat his suffering came only from his uncertainty? Tears clouded his\nvision, yet still he looked, he exhausted himself in this longing to\nknow, in which his reason must finally give way.\n\nClotilde hastily concealed herself as she saw him walk over to the\npress, which he opened wide. He seized the envelopes, threw them on\nthe table, and searched among them feverishly. It was the scene of the\nterrible night of the storm that was beginning over again, the gallop\nof nightmares, the procession of phantoms, rising at his call from this\nheap of old papers. As they passed by, he addressed to each of them a\nquestion, an ardent prayer, demanding the origin of his malady, hoping\nfor a word, a whisper which should set his doubts at rest. First, it was\nonly an indistinct murmur, then came words and fragments of phrases.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it you--is it you--is it you--oh, old mother, the mother of us\nall--who are to give me your madness? Is it you, inebriate uncle, old\nscoundrel of an uncle, whose drunkenness I am to pay for? Is it you,\nataxic nephew, or you, mystic nephew, or yet you, idiot niece, who are\nto reveal to me the truth, showing me one of the forms of the lesion\nfrom which I suffer? Or is it rather you, second cousin, who hanged\nyourself; or you, second cousin, who committed murder; or you, second\ncousin, who died of rottenness, whose tragic ends announce to me\nmine--death in a cell, the horrible decomposition of being?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd the gallop continued, they rose and passed by with the speed of the\nwind. The papers became animate, incarnate, they jostled one another,\nthey trampled on one another, in a wild rush of suffering humanity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, who will tell me, who will tell me, who will tell me?--Is it he\nwho died mad? he who was carried off by phthisis? he who was killed\nby paralysis? she whose constitutional feebleness caused her to die\nin early youth?--Whose is the poison of which I am to die? What is it,\nhysteria, alcoholism, tuberculosis, scrofula? And what is it going to\nmake of me, an ataxic or a madman? A madman. Who was it said a madman?\nThey all say it--a madman, a madman, a madman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSobs choked Pascal. He let his dejected head fall among the papers, he\nwept endlessly, shaken by shuddering sobs. And Clotilde, seized by a\nsort of awe, feeling the presence of the fate which rules over races,\nleft the room softly, holding her breath; for she knew that it would\nmortify him exceedingly if he knew that she had been present.\n\nLong periods of prostration followed. January was very cold. But the sky\nremained wonderfully clear, a brilliant sun shone in the limpid blue;\nand at La Souleiade, the windows of the study facing south formed a sort\nof hothouse, preserving there a delightfully mild temperature. They did\nnot even light a fire, for the room was always filled with a flood of\nsunshine, in which the flies that had survived the winter flew about\nlazily. The only sound to be heard was the buzzing of their wings. It\nwas a close and drowsy warmth, like a breath of spring that had lingered\nin the old house baked by the heat of summer.\n\nPascal, still gloomy, dragged through the days there, and it was there,\ntoo, that he overheard one day the closing words of a conversation\nwhich aggravated his suffering. As he never left his room now before\nbreakfast, Clotilde had received Dr. Ramond this morning in the study,\nand they were talking there together in an undertone, sitting beside\neach other in the bright sunshine.\n\nIt was the third visit which Ramond had made during the last week.\nPersonal reasons, the necessity, especially, of establishing definitely\nhis position as a physician at Plassans, made it expedient for him not\nto defer his marriage much longer: and he wished to obtain from Clotilde\na decisive answer. On each of his former visits the presence of a third\nperson had prevented him from speaking. As he desired to receive her\nanswer from herself directly he had resolved to declare himself to her\nin a frank conversation. Their intimate friendship, and the discretion\nand good sense of both, justified him in taking this step. And he ended,\nsmiling, looking into her eyes:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI assure you, Clotilde, that it is the most reasonable of\n_denouements_. You know that I have loved you for a long time. I have a\nprofound affection and esteem for you. That alone might perhaps not be\nsufficient, but, in addition, we understand each other perfectly, and we\nshould be very happy together, I am convinced of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did not cast down her eyes; she, too, looked at him frankly, with a\nfriendly smile. He was, in truth, very handsome, in his vigorous young\nmanhood.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy do you not marry Mlle. Leveque, the lawyer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is prettier and richer than I am, and I know that she would gladly\naccept you. My dear friend, I fear that you are committing a folly in\nchoosing me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe did not grow impatient, seeming still convinced of the wisdom of his\ndetermination.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I do not love Mlle. Leveque, and I do love you. Besides, I have\nconsidered everything, and I repeat that I know very well what I am\nabout. Say yes; you can take no better course.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen she grew very serious, and a shadow passed over her face, the\nshadow of those reflections, of those almost unconscious inward\nstruggles, which kept her silent for days at a time. She did not see\nclearly yet, she still struggled against herself, and she wished to\nwait.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, my friend, since you are really serious, do not ask me to give\nyou an answer to-day; grant me a few weeks longer. Master is indeed very\nill. I am greatly troubled about him; and you would not like to owe my\nconsent to a hasty impulse. I assure you, for my part, that I have a\ngreat deal of affection for you, but it would be wrong to decide at this\nmoment; the house is too unhappy. It is agreed, is it not? I will not\nmake you wait long.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd to change the conversation she added:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I am uneasy about master. I wished to see you, in order to tell\nyou so. The other day I surprised him weeping violently, and I am\ncertain the fear of becoming mad haunts him. The day before yesterday,\nwhen you were talking to him, I saw that you were examining him. Tell me\nfrankly, what do you think of his condition? Is he in any danger?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot the slightest!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Dr. Ramond. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis system is a little out\nof order, that is all. How can a man of his ability, who has made so\nclose a study of nervous diseases, deceive himself to such an extent? It\nis discouraging, indeed, if the clearest and most vigorous minds can go\nso far astray. In his case his own discovery of hypodermic injections\nwould be excellent. Why does he not use them with himself?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd as the young girl replied, with a despairing gesture, that he would\nnot listen to her, that he would not even allow her to speak to him now,\nRamond said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then, I will speak to him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was at this moment that Pascal came out of his room, attracted by\nthe sound of voices. But on seeing them both so close to each other,\nso animated, so youthful, and so handsome in the sunshine--clothed with\nsunshine, as it were--he stood still in the doorway. He looked fixedly\nat them, and his pale face altered.\n\nRamond had a moment before taken Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand, and he was holding it\nin his.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a promise, is it not? I should like the marriage to take place\nthis summer. You know how much I love you, and I shall eagerly await\nyour answer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBefore a month all will be settled.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA sudden giddiness made Pascal stagger. Here now was this boy, his\nfriend, his pupil, who had introduced himself into his house to rob him\nof his treasure! He ought to have expected this _denouement_, yet the\nsudden news of a possible marriage surprised him, overwhelmed him like\nan unforeseen catastrophe that had forever ruined his life. This girl\nwhom he had fashioned, whom he had believed his own, she would leave\nhim, then, without regret, she would leave him to die alone in his\nsolitude. Only the day before she had made him suffer so intensely that\nhe had asked himself whether he should not part from her and send her to\nher brother, who was always writing for her. For an instant he had even\ndecided on this separation, for the good of both. Yet to find her here\nsuddenly, with this man, to hear her promise to give him an answer, to\nthink that she would marry, that she would soon leave him, this stabbed\nhim to the heart.\n\nAt the sound of his heavy step as he came forward, the two young people\nturned round in some embarrassment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, master, we were just talking about you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ramond gaily. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\nto be frank with you, we were conspiring. Come, why do you not take care\nof yourself? There is nothing serious the matter with you; you would be\non your feet again in a fortnight if you did.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal, who had dropped into a chair, continued to look at them. He had\nstill the power to control himself, and his countenance gave no evidence\nof the wound which he had just received. He would assuredly die of it,\nand no one would suspect the malady which had carried him off. But it\nwas a relief to him to be able to give vent to his feelings, and he\ndeclared violently that he would not take even so much as a glass of\ntisane.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake care of myself!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat for? Is it not all over with my\nold carcass?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRamond insisted, with a good-tempered smile.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are sounder than any of us. This is a trifling disturbance, and\nyou know that you have the remedy in your own hands. Use your hypodermic\ninjection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal did not allow him to finish. This filled the measure of his rage.\nHe angrily asked if they wished him to kill himself, as he had killed\nLafouasse. His injections! A pretty invention, of which he had good\nreason to be proud. He abjured medicine, and he swore that he would\nnever again go near a patient. When people were no longer good for\nanything they ought to die; that would be the best thing for everybody.\nAnd that was what he was going to try to do, so as to have done with it\nall.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBah! bah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ramond at last, resolving to take his leave, through\nfear of exciting him still further; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will leave you with Clotilde; I\nam not at all uneasy, Clotilde will take care of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Pascal had on this morning received the final blow. He took to his\nbed toward evening, and remained for two whole days without opening\nthe door of his room. It was in vain that Clotilde, at last becoming\nalarmed, knocked loudly at the door. There was no answer. Martine went\nin her turn and begged monsieur, through the keyhole, at least to tell\nher if he needed anything. A deathlike silence reigned; the room seemed\nto be empty.\n\nThen, on the morning of the third day, as the young girl by chance\nturned the knob, the door yielded; perhaps it had been unlocked for\nhours. And she might enter freely this room in which she had never set\nfoot: a large room, rendered cold by its northern exposure, in which she\nsaw a small iron bed without curtains, a shower bath in a corner, a long\nblack wooden table, a few chairs, and on the table, on the floor, along\nthe walls, an array of chemical apparatus, mortars, furnaces, machines,\ninstrument cases. Pascal, up and dressed, was sitting on the edge of his\nbed, in trying to arrange which he had exhausted himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you want me to nurse you, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked with anxious\ntenderness, without venturing to advance into the room.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, you can come in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said with a dejected gesture. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t beat\nyou. I have not the strength to do that now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd from this day on he tolerated her about him, and allowed her to wait\non him. But he had caprices still. He would not let her enter the room\nwhen he was in bed, possessed by a sort of morbid shame; then he made\nher send him Martine. But he seldom remained in bed, dragging himself\nabout from chair to chair, in his utter inability to do any kind of\nwork. His malady continued to grow worse, until at last he was reduced\nto utter despair, tortured by sick headaches, and without the strength,\nas he said, to put one foot before the other, convinced every morning\nthat he would spend the night at the Tulettes, a raving maniac. He grew\nthin; his face, under its crown of white hair--which he still cared\nfor through a last remnant of vanity--acquired a look of suffering,\nof tragic beauty. And although he allowed himself to be waited on, he\nrefused roughly all remedies, in the distrust of medicine into which he\nhad fallen.\n\nClotilde now devoted herself to him entirely. She gave up everything\nelse; at first she attended low mass, then she left off going to church\naltogether. In her impatience for some certain happiness, she felt as if\nshe were taking a step toward that end by thus devoting all her moments\nto the service of a beloved being whom she wished to see once more well\nand happy. She made a complete sacrifice of herself, she sought to\nfind happiness in the happiness of another; and all this unconsciously,\nsolely at the impulse of her woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart, in the midst of the crisis\nthrough which she was still passing, and which was modifying her\ncharacter profoundly, without her knowledge. She remained silent\nregarding the disagreement which separated them. The idea did not again\noccur to her to throw herself on his neck, crying that she was his, that\nhe might return to life, since she gave herself to him. In her thoughts\nshe grieved to see him suffer; she was only an affectionate girl,\nwho took care of him, as any female relative would have done. And\nher attentions were very pure, very delicate, occupying her life so\ncompletely that her days now passed swiftly, exempt from tormenting\nthoughts of the Beyond, filled with the one wish of curing him.\n\nBut where she had a hard battle to fight was in prevailing upon him\nto use his hypodermic injections upon himself. He flew into a passion,\ndisowned his discovery, and called himself an imbecile. She too cried\nout. It was she now who had faith in science, who grew indignant at\nseeing him doubt his own genius. He resisted for a long time; then\nyielding to the empire which she had acquired over him, he consented,\nsimply to avoid the affectionate dispute which she renewed with him\nevery morning. From the very first he experienced great relief from\nthe injections, although he refused to acknowledge it. His mind became\nclearer, and he gradually gained strength. Then she was exultant, filled\nwith enthusiastic pride in him. She vaunted his treatment, and became\nindignant because he did not admire himself, as an example of the\nmiracles which he was able to work. He smiled; he was now beginning to\nsee clearly into his own condition. Ramond had spoken truly, his illness\nhad been nothing but nervous exhaustion. Perhaps he would get over it\nafter all.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, it is you who are curing me, little girl,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would say, not\nwishing to confess his hopes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMedicines, you see, act according to the\nhand that gives them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe convalescence was slow, lasting through the whole of February. The\nweather remained clear and cold; there was not a single day in which\nthe study was not flooded with warm, pale sunshine. There were hours\nof relapse, however, hours of the blackest melancholy, in which all the\npatient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terrors returned; when his guardian, disconsolate, was obliged\nto sit at the other end of the room, in order not to irritate him still\nmore. He despaired anew of his recovery. He became again bitter and\naggressively ironical.\n\nIt was on one of those bad days that Pascal, approaching a window, saw\nhis neighbor, M. Bellombre, the retired professor, making the round of\nhis garden to see if his fruit trees were well covered with blossoms.\nThe sight of the old man, so neat and so erect, with the fine placidity\nof the egoist, on whom illness had apparently never laid hold, suddenly\nput Pascal beside himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he growled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is one who will never overwork himself, who\nwill never endanger his health by worrying!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he launched forth into an ironical eulogy on selfishness. To be\nalone in the world, not to have a friend, to have neither wife nor\nchild, what happiness! That hard-hearted miser, who for forty years\nhad had only other people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s children to cuff, who lived aloof from the\nworld, without even a dog, with a deaf and dumb gardener older than\nhimself, was he not an example of the greatest happiness possible on\nearth? Without a responsibility, without a duty, without an anxiety,\nother than that of taking care of his dear health! He was a wise man, he\nwould live a hundred years.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, the fear of life! that is cowardice which is truly the best wisdom.\nTo think that I should ever have regretted not having a child of my own!\nHas any one a right to bring miserable creatures into the world? Bad\nheredity should be ended, life should be ended. The only honest man is\nthat old coward there!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nM. Bellombre continued peacefully making the round of his pear trees in\nthe March sunshine. He did not risk a too hasty movement; he economized\nhis fresh old age. If he met a stone in his path, he pushed it aside\nwith the end of his cane, and then walked tranquilly on.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook at him! Is he not well preserved; is he not handsome? Have not all\nthe blessings of heaven been showered down upon him? He is the happiest\nman I know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde, who had listened in silence, suffered from the irony of\nPascal, the full bitterness of which she divined. She, who usually took\nM. Bellombre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part, felt a protest rise up within her. Tears came to\nher eyes, and she answered simply in a low voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes; but he is not loved.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThese words put a sudden end to the painful scene. Pascal, as if he had\nreceived an electric shock, turned and looked at her. A sudden rush of\ntenderness brought tears to his eyes also, and he left the room to keep\nfrom weeping.\n\nThe days wore on in the midst of these alternations of good and bad\nhours. He recovered his strength but slowly, and what put him in despair\nwas that whenever he attempted to work he was seized by a profuse\nperspiration. If he had persisted, he would assuredly have fainted. So\nlong as he did not work he felt that his convalescence was making little\nprogress. He began to take an interest again, however, in his accustomed\ninvestigations. He read over again the last pages that he had written,\nand, with this reawakening of the scientist in him, his former anxieties\nreturned. At one time he fell into a state of such depression, that the\nhouse and all it contained ceased to exist for him. He might have been\nrobbed, everything he possessed might have been taken and destroyed,\nwithout his even being conscious of the disaster. Now he became again\nwatchful, from time to time he would feel his pocket, to assure himself\nthat the key of the press was there.\n\nBut one morning when he had overslept himself, and did not leave\nhis room until eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, he saw Clotilde in the study, quietly\noccupied in copying with great exactness in pastel a branch of flowering\nalmond. She looked up, smiling; and taking a key that was lying beside\nher on the desk, she offered it to him, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere, master.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSurprised, not yet comprehending, he looked at the object which she held\ntoward him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the key of the press, which you must have dropped from your\npocket yesterday, and which I picked up here this morning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal took it with extraordinary emotion. He looked at it, and then at\nClotilde. Was it ended, then? She would persecute him no more. She was\nno longer eager to rob everything, to burn everything. And seeing her\nstill smiling, she also looking moved, an immense joy filled his heart.\n\nHe caught her in his arms, crying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, little girl, if we might only not be too unhappy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he opened a drawer of his table and threw the key into it, as he\nused to do formerly.\n\nFrom this time on he gained strength, and his convalescence progressed\nmore rapidly. Relapses were still possible, for he was still very weak.\nBut he was able to write, and this made the days less heavy. The sun,\ntoo, shone more brightly, the study being so warm at times that it\nbecame necessary to half close the shutters. He refused to see visitors,\nbarely tolerated Martine, and had his mother told that he was sleeping,\nwhen she came at long intervals to inquire for him. He was happy only in\nthis delightful solitude, nursed by the rebel, the enemy of yesterday,\nthe docile pupil of to-day. They would often sit together in silence\nfor a long time, without feeling any constraint. They meditated, or lost\nthemselves in infinitely sweet reveries.\n\nOne day, however, Pascal seemed very grave. He was now convinced\nthat his illness had resulted from purely accidental causes, and that\nheredity had had no part in it. But this filled him none the less with\nhumility.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy God!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he murmured, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow insignificant we are! I who thought myself\nso strong, who was so proud of my sane reason! And here have I barely\nescaped being made insane by a little trouble and overwork!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was silent, and sank again into thought. After a time his eyes\nbrightened, he had conquered himself. And in a moment of reason and\ncourage, he came to a resolution.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I am getting better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is especially for your sake that\nI am glad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde, not understanding, looked up and said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow is that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, on account of your marriage. Now you will be able to fix the day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe still seemed surprised.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, true--my marriage!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShall we decide at once upon the second week in June?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, the second week in June; that will do very well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey spoke no more; she fixed her eyes again on the piece of sewing on\nwhich she was engaged, while he, motionless, and with a grave face, sat\nlooking into space.\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\nOn this day, on arriving at La Souleiade, old Mme. Rougon perceived\nMartine in the kitchen garden, engaged in planting leeks; and, as she\nsometimes did, she went over to the servant to have a chat with her, and\nfind out from her how things were going on, before entering the house.\n\nFor some time past she had been in despair about what she called\nClotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desertion. She felt truly that she would now never obtain\nthe documents through her. The girl was behaving disgracefully, she was\nsiding with Pascal, after all she had done for her; and she was becoming\nperverted to such a degree that for a month past she had not been seen\nin Church. Thus she returned to her first idea, to get Clotilde away and\nwin her son over when, left alone, he should be weakened by solitude.\nSince she had not been able to persuade the girl to go live with her\nbrother, she eagerly desired the marriage. She would like to throw her\ninto Dr. Ramond\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms to-morrow, in her impatience at so many delays.\nAnd she had come this afternoon with a feverish desire to hurry on\nmatters.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-day, Martine. How is every one here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe servant, kneeling down, her hands full of clay, lifted up her pale\nface, protected against the sun by a handkerchief tied over her cap.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs usual, madame, pretty well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey went on talking, Felicite treating her as a confidante, as a\ndevoted daughter, one of the family, to whom she could tell everything.\nShe began by questioning her; she wished to know if Dr. Ramond had come\nthat morning. He had come, but they had talked only about indifferent\nmatters. This put her in despair, for she had seen the doctor on the\nprevious day, and he had unbosomed himself to her, chagrined at not\nhaving yet received a decisive answer, and eager now to obtain at least\nClotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s promise. Things could not go on in this way, the young girl\nmust be compelled to engage herself to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has too much delicacy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have told him so. I knew very\nwell that this morning, even, he would not venture to demand a positive\nanswer. And I have come to interfere in the matter. We shall see if I\ncannot oblige her to come to a decision.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, more calmly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy son is on his feet now; he does not need her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMartine, who was again stooping over the bed, planting her leeks,\nstraightened herself quickly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, that for sure!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd a flush passed over her face, worn by thirty years of service. For a\nwound bled within her; for some time past the master scarcely tolerated\nher about him. During the whole time of his illness he had kept her at\na distance, accepting her services less and less every day, and finally\nclosing altogether to her the door of his room and of the workroom.\nShe had a vague consciousness of what was taking place, an instinctive\njealousy tortured her, in her adoration of the master, whose chattel she\nhad been satisfied to be for so many years.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor sure, we have no need of mademoiselle. I am quite able to take care\nof monsieur.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen she, who was so discreet, spoke of her labors in the garden, saying\nthat she made time to cultivate the vegetables, so as to save a few\ndays\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wages of a man. True, the house was large, but when one was not\nafraid of work, one could manage to do all there was to be done. And\nthen, when mademoiselle should have left them, that would be always one\nless to wait upon. And her eyes brightened unconsciously at the thought\nof the great solitude, of the happy peace in which they should live\nafter this departure.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would give me pain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, lowering her voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor it would\ncertainly give monsieur a great deal. I would never have believed that\nI could be brought to wish for such a separation. Only, madame, I agree\nwith you that it is necessary, for I am greatly afraid that mademoiselle\nwill end by going to ruin here, and that there will be another soul\nlost to the good God. Ah, it is very sad; my heart is so heavy about it\nsometimes that it is ready to burst.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are both upstairs, are they not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Felicite. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will go up and\nsee them, and I will undertake to oblige them to end the matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAn hour later, when she came down again, she found Martine still on\nher knees on the soft earth, finishing her planting. Upstairs, from her\nfirst words, when she said that she had been talking with Dr. Ramond,\nand that he had shown himself anxious to know his fate quickly, she saw\nthat Dr. Pascal approved--he looked grave, he nodded his head as if\nto say that this wish seemed to him very natural. Clotilde, herself,\nceasing to smile, seemed to listen to him with deference. But she\nmanifested some surprise. Why did they press her? Master had fixed the\nmarriage for the second week in June; she had, then, two full months\nbefore her. Very soon she would speak about it with Ramond. Marriage was\nso serious a matter that they might very well give her time to reflect,\nand let her wait until the last moment to engage herself. And she said\nall this with her air of good sense, like a person resolved on coming to\na decision. And Felicite was obliged to content herself with the evident\ndesire that both had that matters should have the most reasonable\nconclusion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed I believe that it is settled,\u00e2\u0080\u009d ended Felicite. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe seems to\nplace no obstacle in the way, and she seems only to wish not to act\nhastily, like a girl who desires to examine her heart closely, before\nengaging herself for life. I will give her a week more for reflection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMartine, sitting on her heels, was looking fixedly on the ground with a\nclouded face.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she murmured, in a low voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmademoiselle has been\nreflecting a great deal of late. I am always meeting her in some corner.\nYou speak to her, and she does not answer you. That is the way people\nare when they are breeding a disease, or when they have a secret on\ntheir mind. There is something going on; she is no longer the same, no\nlonger the same.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she took the dibble again and planted a leek, in her rage for work;\nwhile old Mme. Rougon went away, somewhat tranquillized; certain, she\nsaid, that the marriage would take place.\n\nPascal, in effect, seemed to accept Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s marriage as a thing\nsettled, inevitable. He had not spoken with her about it again, the\nrare allusions which they made to it between themselves, in their hourly\nconversations, left them undisturbed; and it was simply as if the two\nmonths which they still had to live together were to be without end, an\neternity stretching beyond their view.\n\nShe, especially, would look at him smiling, putting off to a future\nday troubles and decisions with a pretty vague gesture, as if to leave\neverything to beneficent life. He, now well and gaining strength daily,\ngrew melancholy only when he returned to the solitude of his chamber\nat night, after she had retired. He shuddered and turned cold at the\nthought that a time would come when he would be always alone. Was it the\nbeginning of old age that made him shiver in this way? He seemed to\nsee it stretching before him, like a shadowy region in which he already\nbegan to feel all his energy melting away. And then the regret of having\nneither wife nor child filled him with rebelliousness, and wrung his\nheart with intolerable anguish.\n\nAh, why had he not lived! There were times when he cursed science,\naccusing it of having taken from him the best part of his manhood.\nHe had let himself be devoured by work; work had consumed his brain,\nconsumed his heart, consumed his flesh. All this solitary, passionate\nlabor had produced only books, blackened paper, that would be scattered\nto the winds, whose cold leaves chilled his hands as he turned them\nover. And no living woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breast to lean upon, no child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s warm locks\nto kiss! He had lived the cold, solitary life of a selfish scientist,\nand he would die in cold solitude. Was he indeed going to die thus?\nWould he never taste the happiness enjoyed by even the common porters,\nby the carters who cracked their whips, passing by under his windows?\nBut he must hasten, if he would; soon, no doubt, it would be too late.\nAll his unemployed youth, all his pent-up desires, surged tumultuously\nthrough his veins. He swore that he would yet love, that he would live\na new life, that he would drain the cup of every passion that he had not\nyet tasted, before he should be an old man. He would knock at the doors,\nhe would stop the passers-by, he would scour the fields and town.\n\nOn the following day, when he had taken his shower bath and left his\nroom, all his fever was calmed, the burning pictures had faded away,\nand he fell back into his natural timidity. Then, on the next night, the\nfear of solitude drove sleep away as before, his blood kindled again,\nand the same despair, the same rebelliousness, the same longing not to\ndie without having known family joys returned. He suffered a great deal\nin this crisis.\n\nDuring these feverish nights, with eyes wide open in the darkness, he\ndreamed always, over and over again the same dream. A girl would come\nalong the road, a girl of twenty, marvelously beautiful; and she would\nenter and kneel down before him in an attitude of submissive adoration,\nand he would marry her. She was one of those pilgrims of love such as\nwe find in ancient story, who have followed a star to come and restore\nhealth and strength to some aged king, powerful and covered with glory.\nHe was the aged king, and she adored him, she wrought the miracle, with\nher twenty years, of bestowing on him a part of her youth. In her love\nhe recovered his courage and his faith in life.\n\nAh, youth! he hungered fiercely for it. In his declining days this\npassionate longing for youth was like a revolt against approaching age,\na desperate desire to turn back, to be young again, to begin life over\nagain. And in this longing to begin life over again, there was not only\nregret for the vanished joys of youth, the inestimable treasure of dead\nhours, to which memory lent its charm; there was also the determined\nwill to enjoy, now, his health and strength, to lose nothing of the joy\nof loving! Ah, youth! how eagerly he would taste of its every pleasure,\nhow eagerly he would drain every cup, before his teeth should fall out,\nbefore his limbs should grow feeble, before the blood should be chilled\nin his veins. A pang pierced his heart when he remembered himself, a\nslender youth of twenty, running and leaping agilely, vigorous and hardy\nas a young oak, his teeth glistening, his hair black and luxuriant. How\nhe would cherish them, these gifts scorned before, if a miracle could\nrestore them to him!\n\nAnd youthful womanhood, a young girl who might chance to pass by,\ndisturbed him, causing him profound emotion. This was often even\naltogether apart from the individual: the image, merely, of youth, the\nperfume and the dazzling freshness which emanated from it, bright eyes,\nhealthy lips, blooming cheeks, a delicate neck, above all, rounded\nand satin-smooth, shaded on the back with down; and youthful womanhood\nalways presented itself to him tall and slight, divinely slender in its\nchaste nudeness. His eyes, gazing into vacancy, followed the vision,\nhis heart was steeped in infinite longing. There was nothing good or\ndesirable but youth; it was the flower of the world, the only beauty,\nthe only joy, the only true good, with health, which nature could bestow\non man. Ah, to begin life over again, to be young again, to clasp in his\nembrace youthful womanhood!\n\nPascal and Clotilde, now that the fine April days had come, covering the\nfruit trees with blossoms, resumed their morning walks in La Souleiade.\nIt was the first time that he had gone out since his illness, and she\nled him to the threshing yard, along the paths in the pine wood, and\nback again to the terrace crossed by the two bars of shadows thrown by\nthe secular cypresses. The sun had already warmed the old flagstones\nthere, and the wide horizon stretched out under a dazzling sky.\n\nOne morning when Clotilde had been running, she returned to the house in\nsuch exuberant spirits and so full of pleasant excitement that she went\nup to the workroom without taking off either her garden hat or the lace\nscarf which she had tied around her neck.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am so warm! And how stupid I am, not to have taken\noff my things downstairs. I will go down again at once.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe had thrown the scarf on a chair on entering.\n\nBut her feverish fingers became impatient when she tried to untie the\nstrings of her large straw hat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere, now! I have fastened the knot. I cannot undo it, and you must\ncome to my assistance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal, happy and excited too by the pleasure of the walk, rejoiced to\nsee her so beautiful and so merry. He went over and stood in front of\nher.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWait; hold up your chin. Oh, if you keep moving like that, how do you\nsuppose I can do it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe laughed aloud. He could see the laughter swelling her throat, like\na wave of sound. His fingers became entangled under her chin, that\ndelicious part of the throat whose warm satin he involuntarily touched.\nShe had on a gown cut sloping in the neck, and through the opening he\ninhaled all the living perfume of the woman, the pure fragrance of her\nyouth, warmed by the sunshine. All at once a vertigo seized him and he\nthought he was going to faint.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no! I cannot do it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cunless you keep still!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe blood throbbed in his temples, and his fingers trembled, while she\nleaned further back, unconsciously offering the temptation of her fresh\ngirlish beauty. It was the vision of royal youth, the bright eyes,\nthe healthy lips, the blooming cheeks, above all, the delicate neck,\nsatin-smooth and round, shaded on the back by down. And she seemed\nto him so delicately graceful, with her slender throat, in her divine\nbloom!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere, it is done!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.\n\nWithout knowing how, he had untied the strings. The room whirled round,\nand then he saw her again, bareheaded now, with her starlike face,\nshaking back her golden curls laughingly. Then he was seized with a fear\nthat he would catch her in his arms and press mad kisses on her bare\nneck, and arms, and throat. And he fled from the room, taking with him\nthe hat, which he had kept in his hand, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will hang it in the hall. Wait for me; I want to speak to Martine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOnce downstairs, he hurried to the abandoned room and locked himself\ninto it, trembling lest she should become uneasy and come down here\nto seek him. He looked wild and haggard, as if he had just committed\na crime. He spoke aloud, and he trembled as he gave utterance for the\nfirst time to the cry that he had always loved her madly, passionately.\nYes, ever since she had grown into womanhood he had adored her. And\nhe saw her clearly before him, as if a curtain had been suddenly torn\naside, as she was when, from an awkward girl, she became a charming and\nlovely creature, with her long tapering limbs, her strong slender body,\nwith its round throat, round neck, and round and supple arms. And it was\nmonstrous, but it was true--he hungered for all this with a devouring\nhunger, for this youth, this fresh, blooming, fragrant flesh.\n\nThen Pascal, dropping into a rickety chair, hid his face in his hands,\nas if to shut out the light of day, and burst into great sobs. Good God!\nwhat was to become of him? A girl whom his brother had confided to\nhim, whom he had brought up like a good father, and who was now--this\ntemptress of twenty-five--a woman in her supreme omnipotence! He felt\nhimself more defenseless, weaker than a child.\n\nAnd above this physical desire, he loved her also with an immense\ntenderness, enamored of her moral and intellectual being, of her\nright-mindedness, of her fine intelligence, so fearless and so clear.\nEven their discord, the disquietude about spiritual things by which she\nwas tortured, made her only all the more precious to him, as if she\nwere a being different from himself, in whom he found a little of the\ninfinity of things. She pleased him in her rebellions, when she held her\nground against him,--she was his companion and pupil; he saw her such\nas he had made her, with her great heart, her passionate frankness,\nher triumphant reason. And she was always present with him; he did\nnot believe that he could exist where she was not; he had need of her\nbreath; of the flutter of her skirts near him; of her thoughtfulness and\naffection, by which he felt himself constantly surrounded; of her looks;\nof her smile; of her whole daily woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life, which she had given him,\nwhich she would not have the cruelty to take back from him again. At the\nthought that she was going away, that she would not be always here, it\nseemed to him as if the heavens were about to fall and crush him; as if\nthe end of all things had come; as if he were about to be plunged in\nicy darkness. She alone existed in the world, she alone was lofty and\nvirtuous, intelligent and beautiful, with a miraculous beauty. Why,\nthen, since he adored her and since he was her master, did he not go\nupstairs and take her in his arms and kiss her like an idol? They were\nboth free, she was ignorant of nothing, she was a woman in age. This\nwould be happiness.\n\nPascal, who had ceased to weep, rose, and would have walked to the door.\nBut suddenly he dropped again into his chair, bursting into a fresh\npassion of sobs. No, no, it was abominable, it could not be! He felt on\nhis head the frost of his white hair; and he had a horror of his age,\nof his fifty-nine years, when he thought of her twenty-five years. His\nformer chill fear again took possession of him, the certainty that\nshe had subjugated him, that he would be powerless against the daily\ntemptation. And he saw her giving him the strings of her hat to untie;\ncompelling him to lean over her to make some correction in her work; and\nhe saw himself, too, blind, mad, devouring her neck with ardent kisses.\nHis indignation against himself at this was so great that he arose,\nnow courageously, and had the strength to go upstairs to the workroom,\ndetermined to conquer himself.\n\nUpstairs Clotilde had tranquilly resumed her drawing. She did not even\nlook around at his entrance, but contented herself with saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow long you have been! I was beginning to think that Martine must have\nmade a mistake of at least ten sous in her accounts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis customary jest about the servant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s miserliness made him laugh.\nAnd he went and sat down quietly at his table. They did not speak again\nuntil breakfast time. A great sweetness bathed him and calmed him, now\nthat he was near her. He ventured to look at her, and he was touched by\nher delicate profile, by her serious, womanly air of application. Had\nhe been the prey of a nightmare, downstairs, then? Would he be able to\nconquer himself so easily?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, when Martine called them, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow hungry I am! You shall\nsee how I am going to make new muscle!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe went over to him, and took him by the arm, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right, master; you must be gay and strong!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut that night, when he was in his own room, the agony began again. At\nthe thought of losing her he was obliged to bury his face in the pillow\nto stifle his cries. He pictured her to himself in the arms of another,\nand all the tortures of jealousy racked his soul. Never could he find\nthe courage to consent to such a sacrifice. All sorts of plans clasped\ntogether in his seething brain; he would turn her from the marriage, and\nkeep her with him, without ever allowing her to suspect his passion;\nhe would take her away, and they would go from city to city,\noccupying their minds with endless studies, in order to keep up their\ncompanionship as master and pupil; or even, if it should be necessary,\nhe would send her to her brother to nurse him, he would lose her forever\nrather than give her to a husband. And at each of these resolutions he\nfelt his heart, torn asunder, cry out with anguish in the imperious\nneed of possessing her entirely. He was no longer satisfied with her\npresence, he wished to keep her for himself, with himself, as she\nappeared to him in her radiant beauty, in the darkness of his chamber,\nwith her unbound hair falling around her.\n\nHis arms clasped the empty air, and he sprang out of bed, staggering\nlike a drunken man; and it was only in the darkness and silence of the\nworkroom that he awoke from this sudden fit of madness. Where, then,\nwas he going, great God? To knock at the door of this sleeping child?\nto break it in, perhaps, with a blow of his shoulder? The soft, pure\nrespiration, which he fancied he heard like a sacred wind in the midst\nof the profound silence, struck him on the face and turned him back. And\nhe returned to his room and threw himself on his bed, in a passion of\nshame and wild despair.\n\nOn the following day when he arose, Pascal, worn out by want of sleep,\nhad come to a decision. He took his daily shower bath, and he felt\nhimself stronger and saner. The resolution to which he had come was to\ncompel Clotilde to give her word. When she should have formally promised\nto marry Ramond, it seemed to him that this final solution would calm\nhim, would forbid his indulging in any false hopes. This would be a\nbarrier the more, an insurmountable barrier between her and him. He\nwould be from that moment armed against his desire, and if he still\nsuffered, it would be suffering only, without the horrible fear of\nbecoming a dishonorable man.\n\nOn this morning, when he told the young girl that she ought to delay\nno longer, that she owed a decisive answer to the worthy fellow who had\nbeen awaiting it so long, she seemed at first astonished. She looked\nstraight into his eyes, but he had sufficient command over himself not\nto show confusion; he insisted merely, with a slightly grieved air, as\nif it distressed him to have to say these things to her. Finally, she\nsmiled faintly and turned her head aside, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen, master, you wish me to leave you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered evasively, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI assure you that this is becoming\nridiculous. Ramond will have the right to be angry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe went over to her desk, to arrange some papers which were on it.\nThen, after a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s silence, she said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is odd; now you are siding with grandmother and Martine. They, too,\nare persecuting me to end this matter. I thought I had a few days more.\nBut, in truth, if you all three urge me--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did not finish, and he did not press her to explain herself more\nclearly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen do you wish me to tell Ramond to come, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, he may come whenever he wishes; it does not displease me to see\nhim. But don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trouble yourself. I will let him know that we will expect\nhim one of these afternoons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOn the following day the same scene began over again. Clotilde had taken\nno step yet, and Pascal was now angry. He suffered martyrdom; he had\ncrises of anguish and rebelliousness when she was not present to calm\nhim by her smiling freshness. And he insisted, in emphatic language,\nthat she should behave seriously and not trifle any longer with an\nhonorable man who loved her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe devil! Since the thing is decided, let us be done with it. I warn\nyou that I will send word to Ramond, and that he will be here to-morrow\nat three o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe listened in silence, her eyes fixed on the ground. Neither seemed\nto wish to touch upon the question as to whether the marriage had really\nbeen decided on or not, and they took the standpoint that there had been\na previous decision, which was irrevocable. When she looked up again he\ntrembled, for he felt a breath pass by; he thought she was on the point\nof saying that she had questioned herself, and that she refused this\nmarriage. What would he have done, what would have become of him, good\nGod! Already he was filled with an immense joy and a wild terror. But\nshe looked at him with the discreet and affectionate smile which never\nnow left her lips, and she answered with a submissive air:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs you please, master. Send him word to be here to-morrow at three\no\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal spent so dreadful a night that he rose late, saying, as an\nexcuse, that he had one of his old headaches. He found relief only under\nthe icy deluge of the shower bath. At ten o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock he left the house,\nsaying he would go himself to see Ramond; but he had another object\nin going out--he had seen at a show in Plassans a corsage of old point\nd\u00e2\u0080\u0099Alencon; a marvel of beauty which lay there awaiting some lover\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ngenerous folly, and the thought had come to him in the midst of the\ntortures of the night, to make a present of it to Clotilde, to adorn her\nwedding gown. This bitter idea of himself adorning her, of making her\nbeautiful and fair for the gift of herself, touched his heart, exhausted\nby sacrifice. She knew the corsage, she had admired it with him one day\nwonderingly, wishing for it only to place it on the shoulders of the\nVirgin at St. Saturnin, an antique Virgin adored by the faithful. The\nshopkeeper gave it to him in a little box which he could conceal,\nand which he hid, on his return to the house, in the bottom of his\nwriting-desk.\n\nAt three o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock Dr. Ramond presented himself, and he found Pascal and\nClotilde in the parlor, where they had been awaiting him with secret\nexcitement and a somewhat forced gaiety, avoiding any further allusion\nto his visit. They received him smilingly with exaggerated cordiality.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, you are perfectly well again, master!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young man. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\nnever looked so strong.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal shook his head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, oh, strong, perhaps! only the heart is no longer here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis involuntary avowal made Clotilde start, and she looked from one to\nthe other, as if, by the force of circumstances, she compared them with\neach other--Ramond, with his smiling and superb face--the face of the\nhandsome physician adored by the women--his luxuriant black hair and\nbeard, in all the splendor of his young manhood; and Pascal, with his\nwhite hair and his white beard. This fleece of snow, still so abundant,\nretained the tragic beauty of the six months of torture that he had\njust passed through. His sorrowful face had aged a little, only his eyes\nremained still youthful; brown eyes, brilliant and limpid. But at this\nmoment all his features expressed so much gentleness, such exalted\ngoodness, that Clotilde ended by letting her gaze rest upon him with\nprofound tenderness. There was silence for a moment and each heart\nthrilled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, my children,\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed Pascal heroically, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think you have\nsomething to say to each other. I have something to do, too, downstairs.\nI will come up again presently.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he left the room, smiling back at them.\n\nAnd soon as they were alone, Clotilde went frankly straight over to\nRamond, with both hands outstretched. Taking his hands in hers, she held\nthem as she spoke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen, my dear friend; I am going to give you a great grief. You must\nnot be too angry with me, for I assure you that I have a very profound\nfriendship for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe understood at once, and he turned very pale.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cClotilde give me no answer now, I beg of you; take more time, if you\nwish to reflect further.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is useless, my dear friend, my decision is made.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe looked at him with her fine, loyal look. She had not released his\nhands, in order that he might know that she was not excited, and that\nshe was his friend. And it was he who resumed, in a low voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you say no?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI say no, and I assure you that it pains me greatly to say it. Ask me\nnothing; you will no doubt know later on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe sat down, crushed by the emotion which he repressed like a strong and\nself-contained man, whose mental balance the greatest sufferings cannot\ndisturb. Never before had any grief agitated him like this. He remained\nmute, while she, standing, continued:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd above all, my friend, do not believe that I have played the\ncoquette with you. If I have allowed you to hope, if I have made you\nwait so long for my answer, it was because I did not in very truth see\nclearly myself. You cannot imagine through what a crisis I have just\npassed--a veritable tempest of emotions, surrounded by darkness from out\nof which I have but just found my way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe spoke at last.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSince it is your wish, I will ask you nothing. Besides, it is\nsufficient for you to answer one question. You do not love me,\nClotilde?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did not hesitate, but said gravely, with an emotion which softened\nthe frankness of her answer:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is true, I do not love you; I have only a very sincere affection for\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe rose, and stopped by a gesture the kind words which she would have\nadded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is ended; let us never speak of it again. I wished you to be happy.\nDo not grieve for me. At this moment I feel as if the house had just\nfallen about me in ruins. But I must only extricate myself as best I\ncan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA wave of color passed over his pale face, he gasped for air, he crossed\nover to the window, then he walked back with a heavy step, seeking\nto recover his self-possession. He drew a long breath. In the painful\nsilence which had fallen they heard Pascal coming upstairs noisily, to\nannounce his return.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI entreat you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d murmured Clotilde hurriedly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto say nothing to master.\nHe does not know my decision, and I wish to break it to him myself, for\nhe was bent upon this marriage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal stood still in the doorway. He was trembling and breathless, as\nif he had come upstairs too quickly. He still found strength to smile at\nthem, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, children, have you come to an understanding?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, undoubtedly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d responded Ramond, as agitated as himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen it is all settled?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuite,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Clotilde, who had been seized by a faintness.\n\nPascal walked over to his work-table, supporting himself by the\nfurniture, and dropped into the chair beside it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, ah! you see the legs are not so strong after all. It is this old\ncarcass of a body. But the heart is strong. And I am very happy, my\nchildren, your happiness will make me well again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut when Ramond, after a few minutes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 further conversation, had gone\naway, he seemed troubled at finding himself alone with the young girl,\nand he again asked her:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is settled, quite settled; you swear it to me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEntirely settled.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter this he did not speak again. He nodded his head, as if to repeat\nthat he was delighted; that nothing could be better; that at last they\nwere all going to live in peace. He closed his eyes, feigning to\ndrop asleep, as he sometimes did in the afternoon. But his heart beat\nviolently, and his closely shut eyelids held back the tears.\n\nThat evening, at about ten o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, when Clotilde went downstairs for a\nmoment to give an order to Martine before she should have gone to bed,\nPascal profited by the opportunity of being left alone, to go and lay\nthe little box containing the lace corsage on the young girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bed. She\ncame upstairs again, wished him the accustomed good-night, and he had\nbeen for at least twenty minutes in his own room, and was already in his\nshirt sleeves, when a burst of gaiety sounded outside his door. A little\nhand tapped, and a fresh voice cried, laughing:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, come and look!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe opened the door, unable to resist this appeal of youth, conquered by\nhis joy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, come, come and see what a beautiful little bird has put on my bed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she drew him to her room, taking no refusal. She had lighted the two\ncandles in it, and the antique, pleasant chamber, with its hangings of\nfaded rose color, seemed transformed into a chapel; and on the bed, like\na sacred cloth offered to the adoration of the faithful, she had spread\nthe corsage of old point d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Alencon.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou would not believe it! Imagine, I did not see the box at first. I\nset things in order a little, as I do every evening. I undressed, and\nit was only when I was getting into bed that I noticed your present. Ah,\nwhat a surprise! I was overwhelmed by it! I felt that I could never wait\nfor the morning, and I put on a skirt and ran to look for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was not until then that he perceived that she was only half dressed,\nas on the night of the storm, when he had surprised her stealing his\npapers. And she seemed divine, with her tall, girlish form, her tapering\nlimbs, her supple arms, her slender body, with its small, firm throat.\n\nShe took his hands and pressed them caressingly in her little ones.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow good you are; how I thank you! Such a marvel of beauty, so lovely\na present for me, who am nobody! And you remember that I had admired\nit, this antique relic of art. I said to you that only the Virgin of St.\nSaturnin was worthy of wearing it on her shoulders. I am so happy!\noh, so happy! For it is true, I love beautiful things; I love them so\npassionately that at times I wish for impossibilities, gowns woven of\nsunbeams, impalpable veils made of the blue of heaven. How beautiful I\nam going to look! how beautiful I am going to look!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRadiant in her ecstatic gratitude, she drew close to him, still looking\nat the corsage, and compelling him to admire it with her. Then a sudden\ncuriosity seized her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut why did you make me this royal present?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEver since she had come to seek him in her joyful excitement, Pascal\nhad been walking in a dream. He was moved to tears by this affectionate\ngratitude; he stood there, not feeling the terror which he had dreaded,\nbut seeming, on the contrary, to be filled with joy, as at the approach\nof a great and miraculous happiness. This chamber, which he never\nentered, had the religious sweetness of holy places that satisfy all\nlongings for the unattainable.\n\nHis countenance, however, expressed surprise. And he answered:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, this present, my dear, is for your wedding gown.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe, in her turn, looked for a moment surprised as if she had not\nunderstood him. Then, with the sweet and singular smile which she had\nworn of late she said gayly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, true, my marriage!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen she grew serious again, and said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you want to get rid of me? It was in order to have me here no\nlonger that you were so bent upon marrying me. Do you still think me\nyour enemy, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe felt his tortures return, and he looked away from her, wishing to\nretain his courage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy enemy, yes. Are you not so? We have suffered so much through each\nother these last days. It is better in truth that we should separate.\nAnd then I do not know what your thoughts are; you have never given me\nthe answer I have been waiting for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe tried in vain to catch his glance, which he still kept turned away.\nShe began to talk of the terrible night on which they had gone together\nthrough the papers. It was true, in the shock which her whole being had\nsuffered, she had not yet told him whether she was with him or against\nhim. He had a right to demand an answer.\n\nShe again took his hands in hers, and forced him to look at her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it is because I am your enemy that you are sending me away? I am\nnot your enemy. I am your servant, your chattel, your property. Do you\nhear? I am with you and for you, for you alone!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis face grew radiant; an intense joy shone within his eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I will wear this lace. It is for my wedding day, for I wish to be\nbeautiful, very beautiful for you. But do you not understand me, then?\nYou are my master; it is you I love.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no! be silent; you will make me mad! You are betrothed to another.\nYou have given your word. All this madness is happily impossible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe other! I have compared him with you, and I have chosen you. I have\ndismissed him. He has gone away, and he will never return. There are\nonly we two now, and it is you I love, and you love me. I know it, and I\ngive myself to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe trembled violently. He had ceased to struggle, vanquished by the\nlonging of eternal love.\n\nThe spacious chamber, with its antique furniture, warmed by youth, was\nas if filled with light. There was no longer either fear or suffering;\nthey were free. She gave herself to him knowingly, willingly, and he\naccepted the supreme gift like a priceless treasure which the strength\nof his love had won. Suddenly she murmured in his ear, in a caressing\nvoice, lingering tenderly on the words:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster, oh, master, master!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd this word, which she used formerly as a matter of habit, at this\nhour acquired a profound significance, lengthening out and prolonging\nitself, as if it expressed the gift of her whole being. She uttered\nit with grateful fervor, like a woman who accepts, and who surrenders\nherself. Was not the mystic vanquished, the real acknowledged, life\nglorified with love at last confessed and shared.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster, master, this comes from far back. I must tell you; I must make\nmy confession. It is true that I went to church in order to be happy.\nBut I could not believe. I wished to understand too much; my reason\nrebelled against their dogmas; their paradise appeared to me an\nincredible puerility. But I believed that the world does not stop at\nsensation; that there is a whole unknown world, which must be taken\ninto account; and this, master, I believe still. It is the idea of the\nBeyond, which not even happiness, found at last upon your neck, will\nefface. But this longing for happiness, this longing to be happy at\nonce, to have some certainty--how I have suffered from it. If I went to\nchurch, it was because I missed something, and I went there to seek it.\nMy anguish consisted in this irresistible need to satisfy my longing.\nYou remember what you used to call my eternal thirst for illusion and\nfalsehood. One night, in the threshing yard, under the great starry\nsky, do you remember? I burst out against your science, I was indignant\nbecause of the ruins with which it strews the earth, I turned my eyes\naway from the dreadful wounds which it exposes. And I wished, master,\nto take you to a solitude where we might both live in God, far from the\nworld, forgotten by it. Ah, what torture, to long, to struggle, and not\nto be satisfied!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSoftly, without speaking, he kissed her on both eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen, master, do you remember again, there was the great moral shock on\nthe night of the storm, when you gave me that terrible lesson of life,\nemptying out your envelopes before me. You had said to me already: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Know\nlife, love it, live it as it ought to be lived.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 But what a vast, what\na frightful flood, rolling ever onward toward a human sea, swelling it\nunceasingly for the unknown future! And, master, the silent work within\nme began then. There was born, in my heart and in my flesh, the bitter\nstrength of the real. At first I was as if crushed, the blow was so\nrude. I could not recover myself. I kept silent, because I did not know\nclearly what to say. Then, gradually, the evolution was effected. I\nstill had struggles, I still rebelled against confessing my defeat. But\nevery day after this the truth grew clearer within me, I knew well that\nyou were my master, and that there was no happiness for me outside of\nyou, of your science and your goodness. You were life itself, broad and\ntolerant life; saying all, accepting all, solely through the love of\nenergy and effort, believing in the work of the world, placing the\nmeaning of destiny in the labor which we all accomplish with love, in\nour desperate eagerness to live, to love, to live anew, to live always,\nin spite of all the abominations and miseries of life. Oh, to live, to\nlive! This is the great task, the work that always goes on, and that\nwill doubtless one day be completed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSilent still, he smiled radiantly, and kissed her on the mouth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd, master, though I have always loved you, even from my earliest\nyouth, it was, I believe, on that terrible night that you marked me for,\nand made me your own. You remember how you crushed me in your grasp. It\nleft a bruise, and a few drops of blood on my shoulder. Then your being\nentered, as it were into mine. We struggled; you were the stronger, and\nfrom that time I have felt the need of a support. At first I thought\nmyself humiliated; then I saw that it was but an infinitely sweet\nsubmission. I always felt your power within me. A gesture of your hand\nin the distance thrilled me as though it had touched me. I would have\nwished that you had seized me again in your grasp, that you had crushed\nme in it, until my being had mingled with yours forever. And I was\nnot blind; I knew well that your wish was the same as mine, that the\nviolence which had made me yours had made you mine; that you struggled\nwith yourself not to seize me and hold me as I passed by you. To nurse\nyou when you were ill was some slight satisfaction. From that time,\nlight began to break upon me, and I at last understood. I went no more\nto church, I began to be happy near you, you had become certainty and\nhappiness. Do you remember that I cried to you, in the threshing yard,\nthat something was wanting in our affection. There was a void in it\nwhich I longed to fill. What could be wanting to us unless it were God?\nAnd it was God--love, and life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\nThen came a period of idyllic happiness. Clotilde was the spring, the\ntardy rejuvenation that came to Pascal in his declining years. She came,\nbringing to him, with her love, sunshine and flowers. Their rapture\nlifted them above the earth; and all this youth she bestowed on him\nafter his thirty years of toil, when he was already weary and worn\nprobing the frightful wounds of humanity. He revived in the light of her\ngreat shining eyes, in the fragrance of her pure breath. He had faith\nagain in life, in health, in strength, in the eternal renewal of nature.\n\nOn the morning after her avowal it was ten o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock before Clotilde left\nher room. In the middle of the workroom she suddenly came upon Martine\nand, in her radiant happiness, with a burst of joy that carried\neverything before it, she rushed toward her, crying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMartine, I am not going away! Master and I--we love each other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old servant staggered under the blow. Her poor worn face, nunlike\nunder its white cap and with its look of renunciation, grew white in the\nkeenness of her anguish. Without a word, she turned and fled for refuge\nto her kitchen, where, leaning her elbows on her chopping-table, and\nburying her face in her clasped hands, she burst into a passion of sobs.\n\nClotilde, grieved and uneasy, followed her. And she tried to comprehend\nand to console her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, come, how foolish you are! What possesses you? Master and I will\nlove you all the same; we will always keep you with us. You are not\ngoing to be unhappy because we love each other. On the contrary, the\nhouse is going to be gay now from morning till night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Martine only sobbed all the more desperately.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnswer me, at least. Tell me why you are angry and why you cry. Does\nit not please you then to know that master is so happy, so happy! See, I\nwill call master and he will make you answer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this threat the old servant suddenly rose and rushed into her own\nroom, which opened out of the kitchen, slamming the door behind her. In\nvain the young girl called and knocked until she was tired; she\ncould obtain no answer. At last Pascal, attracted by the noise, came\ndownstairs, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, what is the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, it is that obstinate Martine! Only fancy, she began to cry when she\nknew that we loved each other. And she has barricaded herself in there,\nand she will not stir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did not stir, in fact. Pascal, in his turn, called and knocked. He\nscolded; he entreated. Then, one after the other, they began all over\nagain. Still there was no answer. A deathlike silence reigned in\nthe little room. And he pictured it to himself, this little room,\nreligiously clean, with its walnut bureau, and its monastic bed\nfurnished with white hangings. No doubt the servant had thrown herself\nacross this bed, in which she had slept alone all her woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life, and\nwas burying her face in the bolster to stifle her sobs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, so much the worse for her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Clotilde at last, in the egotism\nof her joy, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet her sulk!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen throwing her arms around Pascal, and raising to his her charming\nface, still glowing with the ardor of self-surrender, she said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster, I will be your servant to-day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe kissed her on the eyes with grateful emotion; and she at once set\nabout preparing the breakfast, turning the kitchen upside down. She\nhad put on an enormous white apron, and she looked charming, with her\nsleeves rolled up, showing her delicate arms, as if for some great\nundertaking. There chanced to be some cutlets in the kitchen which she\ncooked to a turn. She added some scrambled eggs, and she even succeeded\nin frying some potatoes. And they had a delicious breakfast, twenty\ntimes interrupted by her getting up in her eager zeal, to run for the\nbread, the water, a forgotten fork. If he had allowed her, she would\nhave waited upon him on her knees. Ah! to be alone, to be only they two\nin this large friendly house, and to be free to laugh and to love each\nother in peace.\n\nThey spent the whole afternoon in sweeping and putting things in order.\nHe insisted upon helping her. It was a play; they amused themselves like\ntwo merry children. From time to time, however, they went back to knock\nat Martine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door to remonstrate with her. Come, this was foolish, she\nwas not going to let herself starve! Was there ever seen such a mule,\nwhen no one had said or done anything to her! But only the echo of their\nknocks came back mournfully from the silent room. Not the slightest\nsound, not a breath responded. Night fell, and they were obliged to make\nthe dinner also, which they ate, sitting beside each other, from the\nsame plate. Before going to bed, they made a last attempt, threatening\nto break open the door, but their ears, glued to the wood, could not\ncatch the slightest sound. And on the following day, when they went\ndownstairs and found the door still hermetically closed, they began to\nbe seriously uneasy. For twenty-four hours the servant had given no sign\nof life.\n\nThen, on returning to the kitchen after a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absence, Clotilde and\nPascal were stupefied to see Martine sitting at her table, picking some\nsorrel for the breakfast. She had silently resumed her place as servant.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what was the matter with you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Clotilde. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you speak\nnow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe lifted up her sad face, stained by tears. It was very calm, however,\nand it expressed now only the resigned melancholy of old age. She looked\nat the young girl with an air of infinite reproach; then she bent her\nhead again without speaking.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you angry with us, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd as she still remained silent, Pascal interposed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you angry with us, my good Martine?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen the old servant looked up at him with her former look of adoration,\nas if she loved him sufficiently to endure all and to remain in spite of\nall. At last she spoke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I am angry with no one. The master is free. It is all right, if he\nis satisfied.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA new life began from this time. Clotilde, who in spite of her\ntwenty-five years had still remained childlike, now, under the influence\nof love, suddenly bloomed into exquisite womanhood. Since her heart had\nawakened, the serious and intelligent boy that she had looked like,\nwith her round head covered with its short curls, had given place to an\nadorable woman, altogether womanly, submissive and tender, loving to be\nloved. Her great charm, notwithstanding her learning picked up at random\nfrom her reading and her work, was her virginal _naivete_, as if her\nunconscious awaiting of love had made her reserve the gift of her whole\nbeing to be utterly absorbed in the man whom she should love. No doubt\nshe had given her love as much through gratitude and admiration as\nthrough tenderness; happy to make him happy; experiencing a profound joy\nin being no longer only a little girl to be petted, but something of his\nvery own which he adored, a precious possession, a thing of grace and\njoy, which he worshiped on bended knees. She still had the religious\nsubmissiveness of the former devotee, in the hands of a master mature\nand strong, from whom she derived consolation and support, retaining,\nabove and beyond affection, the sacred awe of the believer in the\nspiritual which she still was. But more than all, this woman, so\nintoxicated with love, was a delightful personification of health and\ngaiety; eating with a hearty appetite; having something of the valor\nof her grandfather the soldier; filling the house with her swift and\ngraceful movements, with the bloom of her satin skin, the slender grace\nof her neck, of all her young form, divinely fresh.\n\nAnd Pascal, too, had grown handsome again under the influence of\nlove, with the serene beauty of a man who had retained his vigor,\nnotwithstanding his white hairs. His countenance had no longer the\nsorrowful expression which it had worn during the months of grief and\nsuffering through which he had lately passed; his eyes, youthful still,\nhad recovered their brightness, his features their smiling grace; while\nhis white hair and beard grew thicker, in a leonine abundance which\nlent him a youthful air. He had kept himself, in his solitary life as a\npassionate worker, so free from vice and dissipation that he found now\nwithin him a reserve of life and vigor eager to expend itself at last.\nThere awoke within him new energy, a youthful impetuosity that broke\nforth in gestures and exclamations, in a continual need of expansion, of\nliving. Everything wore a new and enchanting aspect to him; the smallest\nglimpse of sky moved him to wonder; the perfume of a simple flower threw\nhim into an ecstasy; an everyday expression of affection, worn by use,\ntouched him to tears, as if it had sprung fresh from the heart and had\nnot been hackneyed by millions of lips. Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cI love you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was\nan infinite caress, whose celestial sweetness no human being had ever\nbefore known. And with health and beauty he recovered also his gaiety,\nthat tranquil gaiety which had formerly been inspired by his love of\nlife, and which now threw sunshine over his love, over everything that\nmade life worth living.\n\nThey two, blooming youth and vigorous maturity, so healthy, so gay,\nso happy, made a radiant couple. For a whole month they remained in\nseclusion, not once leaving La Souleiade. The place where both now liked\nto be was the spacious workroom, so intimately associated with their\nhabits and their past affection. They would spend whole days there,\nscarcely working at all, however. The large carved oak press remained\nwith closed doors; so, too, did the bookcases. Books and papers lay\nundisturbed upon the tables. Like a young married couple they were\nabsorbed in their one passion, oblivious of their former occupations,\noblivious of life. The hours seemed all too short to enjoy the charm of\nbeing together, often seated in the same large antique easy-chair, happy\nin the depths of this solitude in which they secluded themselves, in\nthe tranquillity of this lofty room, in this domain which was altogether\ntheirs, without luxury and without order, full of familiar objects,\nbrightened from morning till night by the returning gaiety of the April\nsunshine. When, seized with remorse, he would talk about working, she\nwould link her supple arms through his and laughingly hold him prisoner,\nso that he should not make himself ill again with overwork. And\ndownstairs, they loved, too, the dining-room, so gay with its light\npanels relieved by blue bands, its antique mahogany furniture, its large\nflower pastels, its brass hanging lamp, always shining. They ate in it\nwith a hearty appetite and they left it, after each meal, only to go\nupstairs again to their dear solitude.\n\nThen when the house seemed too small, they had the garden, all La\nSouleiade. Spring advanced with the advancing sun, and at the end of\nApril the roses were beginning to bloom. And what a joy was this domain,\nwalled around, where nothing from the outside world could trouble\nthem! Hours flew by unnoted, as they sat on the terrace facing the\nvast horizon and the shady banks of the Viorne, and the slopes of\nSainte-Marthe, from the rocky bars of the Seille to the valley of\nPlassans in the dusty distance. There was no shade on the terrace but\nthat of the two secular cypresses planted at its two extremities, like\ntwo enormous green tapers, which could be seen three leagues away. At\ntimes they descended the slope for the pleasure of ascending the giant\nsteps, and climbing the low walls of uncemented stones which supported\nthe plantations, to see if the stunted olive trees and the puny almonds\nwere budding. More often there were delightful walks under the delicate\nneedles of the pine wood, steeped in sunshine and exhaling a strong odor\nof resin; endless walks along the wall of inclosure, from behind which\nthe only sound they could hear was, at rare intervals, the grating noise\nof some cart jolting along the narrow road to Les Fenouilleres; and they\nspent delightful hours in the old threshing yard, where they could see\nthe whole horizon, and where they loved to stretch themselves, tenderly\nremembering their former tears, when, loving each other unconsciously\nto themselves, they had quarreled under the stars. But their favorite\nretreat, where they always ended by losing themselves, was the quincunx\nof tall plane trees, whose branches, now of a tender green, looked like\nlacework. Below, the enormous box trees, the old borders of the French\ngarden, of which now scarcely a trace remained, formed a sort of\nlabyrinth of which they could never find the end. And the slender stream\nof the fountain, with its eternal crystalline murmur, seemed to sing\nwithin their hearts. They would sit hand in hand beside the mossy basin,\nwhile the twilight fell around them, their forms gradually fading into\nthe shadow of the trees, while the water which they could no longer see,\nsang its flutelike song.\n\nUp to the middle of May Pascal and Clotilde secluded themselves in this\nway, without even crossing the threshold of their retreat. One morning\nhe disappeared and returned an hour later, bringing her a pair of\ndiamond earrings which he had hurried out to buy, remembering this was\nher birthday. She adored jewels, and the gift astonished and delighted\nher. From this time not a week passed in which he did not go out once or\ntwice in this way to bring her back some present. The slightest excuse\nwas sufficient for him--a _fete_, a wish, a simple pleasure. He brought\nher rings, bracelets, a necklace, a slender diadem. He would take out\nthe other jewels and please himself by putting them all upon her in\nthe midst of their laughter. She was like an idol, seated on her chair,\ncovered with gold,--a band of gold on her hair, gold on her bare arms\nand on her bare throat, all shining with gold and precious stones. Her\nwoman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vanity was delightfully gratified by this. She allowed herself\nto be adored thus, to be adored on bended knees, like a divinity,\nknowing well that this was only an exalted form of love. She began at\nlast to scold a little, however; to make prudent remonstrances; for, in\ntruth, it was an absurdity to bring her all these gifts which she must\nafterward shut up in a drawer, without ever wearing them, as she went\nnowhere.\n\nThey were forgotten after the hour of joy and gratitude which they gave\nher in their novelty was over. But he would not listen to her, carried\naway by a veritable mania for giving; unable, from the moment the idea\nof giving her an article took possession of him, to resist the desire\nof buying it. It was a munificence of the heart; an imperious desire to\nprove to her that he thought of her always; a pride in seeing her the\nmost magnificent, the happiest, the most envied of women; a generosity\nmore profound even, which impelled him to despoil himself of everything,\nof his money, of his life. And then, what a delight, when he saw he had\ngiven her a real pleasure, and she threw herself on his neck, blushing,\nthanking him with kisses. After the jewels, it was gowns, articles of\ndress, toilet articles. Her room was littered, the drawers were filled\nto overflowing.\n\nOne morning she could not help getting angry. He had brought her another\nring.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, I never wear them! And if I did, my fingers would be covered to\nthe tips. Be reasonable, I beg of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen I have not given you pleasure?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said with confusion.\n\nShe threw her arms about his neck, and assured him with tears in her\neyes that she was very happy. He was so good to her! He was so unwearied\nin his devotion to her! And when, later in the morning, he ventured to\nspeak of making some changes in her room, of covering the walls with\ntapestry, of putting down a carpet, she again remonstrated.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! no, no! I beg of you. Do not touch my old room, so full of\nmemories, where I have grown up, where I told you I loved you. I should\nno longer feel myself at home in it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDownstairs, Martine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obstinate silence condemned still more strongly\nthese excessive and useless expenses. She had adopted a less familiar\nattitude, as if, in the new situation, she had fallen from her role\nof housekeeper and friend to her former station of servant. Toward\nClotilde, especially, she changed, treating her like a young lady, like\na mistress to whom she was less affectionate but more obedient than\nformerly. Two or three times, however, she had appeared in the morning\nwith her face discolored and her eyes sunken with weeping, answering\nevasively when questioned, saying that nothing was the matter, that she\nhad taken cold. And she never made any remark about the gifts with which\nthe drawers were filled. She did not even seem to see them, arranging\nthem without a word either of praise or dispraise. But her whole nature\nrebelled against this extravagant generosity, of which she could never\nhave conceived the possibility. She protested in her own fashion;\nexaggerating her economy and reducing still further the expenses of\nthe housekeeping, which she now conducted on so narrow a scale that she\nretrenched even in the smallest expenses. For instance, she took only\ntwo-thirds of the milk which she had been in the habit of taking, and\nshe served sweet dishes only on Sundays. Pascal and Clotilde, without\nventuring to complain, laughed between themselves at this parsimony,\nrepeating the jests which had amused them for ten years past, saying\nthat after dressing the vegetables she strained them in the colander, in\norder to save the butter for future use.\n\nBut this quarter she insisted upon rendering an account. She was in the\nhabit of going every three months to Master Grandguillot, the notary,\nto receive the fifteen hundred francs income, of which she disposed\nafterward according to her judgment, entering the expenses in a book\nwhich the doctor had years ago ceased to verify. She brought it to him\nnow and insisted upon his looking over it. He excused himself, saying\nthat it was all right.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe thing is, monsieur,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat this time I have been able to\nput some money aside. Yes, three hundred francs. Here they are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked at her in amazement. Generally she just made both ends meet.\nBy what miracle of stinginess had she been able to save such a sum?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! my poor Martine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said at last, laughing, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is the reason,\nthen, that we have been eating so many potatoes of late. You are a pearl\nof economy, but indeed you must treat us a little better in the future.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis discreet reproach wounded her so profoundly that she allowed\nherself at last to say:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, monsieur, when there is so much extravagance on the one hand, it\nis well to be prudent on the other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe understood the allusion, but instead of being angry, he was amused by\nthe lesson.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, ah! it is you who are examining my accounts! But you know very\nwell, Martine, that I, too, have my savings laid by.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe alluded to the money which he still received occasionally from his\npatients, and which he threw into a drawer of his writing-desk. For more\nthan sixteen years past he had put into this drawer every year about\nfour thousand francs, which would have amounted to a little fortune\nif he had not taken from it, from day to day, without counting them,\nconsiderable sums for his experiments and his whims. All the money for\nthe presents came out of this drawer, which he now opened continually.\nHe thought that it would never be empty; he had been so accustomed to\ntake from it whatever he required that it had never occurred to him to\nfear that he would ever come to the bottom of it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne may very well have a little enjoyment out of one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s savings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid gayly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSince it is you who go to the notary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, Martine, you are\nnot ignorant that I have my income apart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen she said, with the colorless voice of the miser who is haunted by\nthe dread of an impending disaster:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what would you do if you hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal looked at her in astonishment, and contented himself with\nanswering with a shrug, for the possibility of such a misfortune had\nnever even entered his mind. He fancied that avarice was turning her\nbrain, and he laughed over the incident that evening with Clotilde.\n\nIn Plassans, too, the presents were the cause of endless gossip. The\nrumor of what was going on at La Souleiade, this strange and sudden\npassion, had spread, no one could tell how, by that force of expansion\nwhich sustains curiosity, always on the alert in small towns. The\nservant certainly had not spoken, but her air was perhaps sufficient;\nwords perhaps had dropped from her involuntarily; the lovers might have\nbeen watched over the walls. And then came the buying of the presents,\nconfirming the reports and exaggerating them. When the doctor, in the\nearly morning, scoured the streets and visited the jeweler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and the\ndressmaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, eyes spied him from the windows, his smallest purchases\nwere watched, all the town knew in the evening that he had given her a\nsilk bonnet, a bracelet set with sapphires. And all this was turned into\na scandal. This uncle in love with his niece, committing a young man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfollies for her, adorning her like a holy Virgin. The most extraordinary\nstories began to circulate, and people pointed to La Souleiade as they\npassed by.\n\nBut old Mme. Rougon was, of all persons, the most bitterly indignant.\nShe had ceased going to her son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house when she learned that Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nmarriage with Dr. Ramond had been broken off. They had made sport of\nher. They did nothing to please her, and she wished to show how deep her\ndispleasure was. Then a full month after the rupture, during which she\nhad understood nothing of the pitying looks, the discreet condolences,\nthe vague smiles which met her everywhere, she learned everything with a\nsuddenness that stunned her. She, who, at the time of Pascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s illness,\nin her mortification at the idea of again becoming the talk of the town\nthrough that ugly story, had raised such a storm! It was far worse\nthis time; the height of scandal, a love affair for people to regale\nthemselves with. The Rougon legend was again in peril; her unhappy son\nwas decidedly doing his best to find some way to destroy the family\nglory won with so much difficulty. So that in her anger she, who had\nmade herself the guardian of this glory, resolving to purify the legend\nby every means in her power, put on her hat one morning and hurried to\nLa Souleiade with the youthful vivacity of her eighty years.\n\nPascal, whom the rupture with his mother enchanted, was fortunately\nnot at home, having gone out an hour before to look for a silver buckle\nwhich he had thought of for a belt. And Felicite fell upon Clotilde\nas the latter was finishing her toilet, her arms bare, her hair loose,\nlooking as fresh and smiling as a rose.\n\nThe first shock was rude. The old lady unburdened her mind, grew\nindignant, spoke of the scandal they were giving. Suddenly her anger\nvanished. She looked at the young girl, and she thought her adorable. In\nher heart she was not surprised at what was going on. She laughed at it,\nall she desired was that it should end in a correct fashion, so as to\nsilence evil tongues. And she cried with a conciliating air:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGet married then! Why do you not get married?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde remained silent for a moment, surprised. She had not thought of\nmarriage. Then she smiled again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo doubt we will get married, grandmother. But later on, there is no\nhurry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOld Mme. Rougon went away, obliged to be satisfied with this vague\npromise.\n\nIt was at this time that Pascal and Clotilde ceased to seclude\nthemselves. Not through any spirit of bravado, not because they wished\nto answer ugly rumors by making a display of their happiness, but as a\nnatural amplification of their joy; their love had slowly acquired the\nneed of expansion and of space, at first beyond the house, then beyond\nthe garden, into the town, as far as the whole vast horizon. It filled\neverything; it took in the whole world.\n\nThe doctor then tranquilly resumed his visits, and he took the young\ngirl with him. They walked together along the promenades, along the\nstreets, she on his arm, in a light gown, with flowers in her hat, he\nbuttoned up in his coat with his broad-brimmed hat. He was all white;\nshe all blond. They walked with their heads high, erect and smiling,\nradiating such happiness that they seemed to walk in a halo. At first\nthe excitement was extraordinary. The shopkeepers came and stood at\ntheir doors, the women leaned out of the windows, the passers-by stopped\nto look after them. People whispered and laughed and pointed to them.\nThen they were so handsome; he superb and triumphant, she so youthful,\nso submissive, and so proud, that an involuntary indulgence gradually\ngained on every one. People could not help defending them and loving\nthem, and they ended by smiling on them in a delightful contagion of\ntenderness. A charm emanated from them which brought back all hearts to\nthem. The new town, with its _bourgeois_ population of functionaries\nand townspeople who had grown wealthy, was the last conquest. But the\nQuartier St. Marc, in spite of its austerity, showed itself at once kind\nand discreetly tolerant when they walked along its deserted grass-worn\nsidewalks, beside the antique houses, now closed and silent, which\nexhaled the evaporated perfume of the loves of other days. But it was\nthe old quarter, more especially, that promptly received them with\ncordiality, this quarter of which the common people, instinctively\ntouched, felt the grace of the legend, the profound myth of the couple,\nthe beautiful young girl supporting the royal and rejuvenated master.\nThe doctor was adored here for his goodness, and his companion quickly\nbecame popular, and was greeted with tokens of admiration and approval\nas soon as she appeared. They, meantime, if they had seemed ignorant\nof the former hostility, now divined easily the forgiveness and the\nindulgent tenderness which surrounded them, and this made them more\nbeautiful; their happiness charmed the entire town.\n\nOne afternoon, as Pascal and Clotilde turned the corner of the Rue de la\nBanne, they perceived Dr. Ramond on the opposite side of the street. It\nhad chanced that they had learned the day before that he had asked and\nhad obtained the hand of Mlle. Leveque, the advocate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter. It was\ncertainly the most sensible course he could have taken, for his business\ninterests made it advisable that he should marry, and the young girl,\nwho was very pretty and very rich, loved him. He, too, would certainly\nlove her in time. Therefore Clotilde joyfully smiled her congratulations\nto him as a sincere friend. Pascal saluted him with an affectionate\ngesture. For a moment Ramond, a little moved by the meeting, stood\nperplexed. His first impulse seemed to have been to cross over to them.\nBut a feeling of delicacy must have prevented him, the thought that it\nwould be brutal to interrupt their dream, to break in upon this solitude\n_a deux_, in which they moved, even amid the elbowings of the street.\nAnd he contented himself with a friendly salutation, a smile in which he\nforgave them their happiness. This was very pleasant for all three.\n\nAt this time Clotilde amused herself for several days by painting\na large pastel representing the tender scene of old King David and\nAbishag, the young Shunammite. It was a dream picture, one of those\nfantastic compositions into which her other self, her romantic self, put\nher love of the mysterious. Against a background of flowers thrown on\nthe canvas, flowers that looked like a shower of stars, of barbaric\nrichness, the old king stood facing the spectator, his hand resting on\nthe bare shoulder of Abishag. He was attired sumptuously in a robe heavy\nwith precious stones, that fell in straight folds, and he wore the royal\nfillet on his snowy locks. But she was more sumptuous still, with only\nthe lilylike satin of her skin, her tall, slender figure, her round,\nslender throat, her supple arms, divinely graceful. He reigned over, he\nleaned, as a powerful and beloved master, on this subject, chosen from\namong all others, so proud of having been chosen, so rejoiced to give to\nher king the rejuvenating gift of her youth. All her pure and triumphant\nbeauty expressed the serenity of her submission, the tranquillity with\nwhich she gave herself, before the assembled people, in the full light\nof day. And he was very great and she was very fair, and there radiated\nfrom both a starry radiance.\n\nUp to the last moment Clotilde had left the faces of the two figures\nvaguely outlined in a sort of mist. Pascal, standing behind her, jested\nwith her to hide his emotion, for he fancied he divined her intention.\nAnd it was as he thought; she finished the faces with a few strokes of\nthe crayon--old King David was he, and she was Abishag, the Shunammite.\nBut they were enveloped in a dreamlike brightness, it was themselves\ndeified; the one with hair all white, the other with hair all blond,\ncovering them like an imperial mantle, with features lengthened by\necstasy, exalted to the bliss of angels, with the glance and the smile\nof immortal youth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, dear!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have made us too beautiful; you have wandered\noff again to dreamland--yes, as in the days, do you remember, when I\nused to scold you for putting there all the fantastic flowers of the\nUnknown?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he pointed to the walls, on which bloomed the fantastic _parterre_\nof the old pastels, flowers not of the earth, grown in the soil of\nparadise.\n\nBut she protested gayly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cToo beautiful? We could not be too beautiful! I assure you it is thus\nthat I picture us to myself, thus that I see us; and thus it is that we\nare. There! see if it is not the pure reality.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe took the old fifteenth century Bible which was beside her, and\nshowed him the simple wood engraving.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see it is exactly the same.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe smiled gently at this tranquil and extraordinary affirmation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, you laugh, you look only at the details of the picture. It is\nthe spirit which it is necessary to penetrate. And look at the other\nengravings, it is the same theme in all--Abraham and Hagar, Ruth and\nBoaz. And you see they are all handsome and happy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen they ceased to laugh, leaning over the old Bible whose pages she\nturned with her white fingers, he standing behind her, his white beard\nmingling with her blond, youthful tresses.\n\nSuddenly he whispered to her softly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you, so young, do you never regret that you have chosen me--me, who\nam so old, as old as the world?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe gave a start of surprise, and turning round looked at him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou old! No, you are young, younger than I!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she laughed so joyously that he, too, could not help smiling. But he\ninsisted a little tremulously:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou do not answer me. Do you not sometimes desire a younger lover, you\nwho are so youthful?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe put up her lips and kissed him, saying in a low voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have but one desire, to be loved--loved as you love me, above and\nbeyond everything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe day on which Martine saw the pastel nailed to the wall, she looked\nat it a moment in silence, then she made the sign of the cross, but\nwhether it was because she had seen God or the devil, no one could\nsay. A few days before Easter she had asked Clotilde if she would\nnot accompany her to church, and the latter having made a sign in the\nnegative, she departed for an instant from the deferential silence which\nshe now habitually maintained. Of all the new things which\nastonished her in the house, what most astonished her was the sudden\nirreligiousness of her young mistress. So she allowed herself to resume\nher former tone of remonstrance, and to scold her as she used to do when\nshe was a little girl and refused to say her prayers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHad she no longer\nthe fear of the Lord before her, then? Did she no longer tremble at the\nidea of going to hell, to burn there forever?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde could not suppress a smile.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, hell! you know that it has never troubled me a great deal. But you\nare mistaken if you think I am no longer religious. If I have left off\ngoing to church it is because I perform my devotions elsewhere, that is\nall.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMartine looked at her, open-mouthed, not comprehending her. It was all\nover; mademoiselle was indeed lost. And she never again asked her to\naccompany her to St. Saturnin. But her own devotion increased until it\nat last became a mania. She was no longer to be met, as before, with the\neternal stocking in her hand which she knitted even when walking, when\nnot occupied in her household duties. Whenever she had a moment to\nspare, she ran to church and remained there, repeating endless prayers.\nOne day when old Mme. Rougon, always on the alert, found her behind a\npillar, an hour after she had seen her there before, Martine excused\nherself, blushing like a servant who had been caught idling, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was praying for monsieur.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMeanwhile Pascal and Clotilde enlarged still more their domain, taking\nlonger and longer walks every day, extending them now outside the\ntown into the open country. One afternoon, as they were going to La\nSeguiranne, they were deeply moved, passing by the melancholy fields\nwhere the enchanted gardens of Le Paradou had formerly extended. The\nvision of Albine rose before them. Pascal saw her again blooming like\nthe spring, in the rejuvenation which this living flower had brought\nhim too, feeling the pressure of this pure arm against his heart. Never\ncould he have believed, he who had already thought himself very old when\nhe used to enter this garden to give a smile to the little fairy within,\nthat she would have been dead for years when life, the good mother,\nshould bestow upon him the gift of so fresh a spring, sweetening his\ndeclining years. And Clotilde, having felt the vision rise before them,\nlifted up her face to his in a renewed longing for tenderness. She was\nAlbine, the eternal lover. He kissed her on the lips, and though no word\nhad been uttered, the level fields sown with corn and oats, where Le\nParadou had once rolled its billows of luxuriant verdure, thrilled in\nsympathy.\n\nPascal and Clotilde were now walking along the dusty road, through the\nbare and arid country. They loved this sun-scorched land, these fields\nthinly planted with puny almond trees and dwarf olives, these stretches\nof bare hills dotted with country houses, that showed on them like pale\npatches accentuated by the dark bars of the secular cypresses. It was\nlike an antique landscape, one of those classic landscapes represented\nin the paintings of the old schools, with harsh coloring and well\nbalanced and majestic lines. All the ardent sunshine of successive\nsummers that had parched this land flowed through their veins, and lent\nthem a new beauty and animation, as they walked under the sky forever\nblue, glowing with the clear flame of eternal love. She, protected from\nthe sun by her straw hat, bloomed and luxuriated in this bath of light\nlike a tropical flower, while he, in his renewed youth, felt the burning\nsap of the soil ascend into his veins in a flood of virile joy.\n\nThis walk to La Seguiranne had been an idea of the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, who had\nlearned through Aunt Dieudonne of the approaching marriage of Sophie to\na young miller of the neighborhood; and he desired to see if every\none was well and happy in this retired corner. All at once they were\nrefreshed by a delightful coolness as they entered the avenue of tall\ngreen oaks. On either side the springs, the mothers of these giant shade\ntrees, flowed on in their eternal course. And when they reached the\nhouse of the shrew they came, as chance would have it, upon the two\nlovers, Sophie and her miller, kissing each other beside the well; for\nthe girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aunt had just gone down to the lavatory behind the willows\nof the Viorne. Confused, the couple stood in blushing silence. But the\ndoctor and his companion laughed indulgently, and the lovers, reassured,\ntold them that the marriage was set for St. John\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day, which was a long\nway off, to be sure, but which would come all the same. Sophie, saved\nfrom the hereditary malady, had improved in health and beauty, and was\ngrowing as strong as one of the trees that stood with their feet in the\nmoist grass beside the springs, and their heads bare to the sunshine.\nAh, the vast, glowing sky, what life it breathed into all created\nthings! She had but one grief, and tears came to her eyes when she spoke\nof her brother Valentin, who perhaps would not live through the week.\nShe had had news of him the day before; he was past hope. And the doctor\nwas obliged to prevaricate a little to console her, for he himself\nexpected hourly the inevitable termination. When he and his companion\nleft La Seguiranne they returned slowly to Plassans, touched by this\nhappy, healthy love saddened by the chill of death.\n\nIn the old quarter a woman whom Pascal was attending informed him that\nValentin had just died. Two of the neighbors were obliged to take away\nLa Guiraude, who, half-crazed, clung, shrieking, to her son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body. The\ndoctor entered the house, leaving Clotilde outside. At last, they again\ntook their way to La Souleiade in silence. Since Pascal had resumed\nhis visits he seemed to make them only through professional duty; he no\nlonger became enthusiastic about the miracles wrought by his treatment.\nBut as far as Valentin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death was concerned, he was surprised that\nit had not occurred before; he was convinced that he had prolonged\nthe patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life for at least a year. In spite of the extraordinary\nresults which he had obtained at first, he knew well that death was the\ninevitable end. That he had held it in check for months ought then to\nhave consoled him and soothed his remorse, still unassuaged, for having\ninvoluntarily caused the death of Lafouasse, a few weeks sooner than it\nwould otherwise have occurred. But this did not seem to be the case,\nand his brow was knitted in a frown as they returned to their beloved\nsolitude. But there a new emotion awaited him; sitting under the plane\ntrees, whither Martine had sent him, he saw Sarteur, the hatter,\nthe inmate of the Tulettes whom he had been so long treating by his\nhypodermic injections, and the experiment so zealously continued seemed\nto have succeeded. The injections of nerve substance had evidently given\nstrength to his will, since the madman was here, having left the asylum\nthat morning, declaring that he no longer had any attacks, that he was\nentirely cured of the homicidal mania that impelled him to throw himself\nupon any passer-by to strangle him. The doctor looked at him as he\nspoke. He was a small dark man, with a retreating forehead and aquiline\nfeatures, with one cheek perceptibly larger than the other. He was\nperfectly quiet and rational, and filled with so lively a gratitude that\nhe kissed his saviour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands. The doctor could not help being greatly\naffected by all this, and he dismissed the man kindly, advising him to\nreturn to his life of labor, which was the best hygiene, physical and\nmoral. Then he recovered his calmness and sat down to table, talking\ngaily of other matters.\n\nClotilde looked at him with astonishment and even with a little\nindignation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the matter, master?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are no longer satisfied\nwith yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, with myself I am never satisfied!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered jestingly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd with\nmedicine, you know--it is according to the day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was on this night that they had their first quarrel. She was angry\nwith him because he no longer had any pride in his profession. She\nreturned to her complaint of the afternoon, reproaching him for not\ntaking more credit to himself for the cure of Sarteur, and even for the\nprolongation of Valentin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life. It was she who now had a passion for\nhis fame. She reminded him of his cures; had he not cured himself? Could\nhe deny the efficacy of his treatment? A thrill ran through him as\nhe recalled the great dream which he had once cherished--to combat\ndebility, the sole cause of disease; to cure suffering humanity; to make\na higher, and healthy humanity; to hasten the coming of happiness, the\nfuture kingdom of perfection and felicity, by intervening and giving\nhealth to all! And he possessed the liquor of life, the universal\npanacea which opened up this immense hope!\n\nPascal was silent for a moment. Then he murmured:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is true. I cured myself, I have cured others, and I still think that\nmy injections are efficacious in many cases. I do not deny medicine.\nRemorse for a deplorable accident, like that of Lafouasse, does not\nrender me unjust. Besides, work has been my passion, it is in work that\nI have up to this time spent my energies; it was in wishing to prove to\nmyself the possibility of making decrepit humanity one day strong and\nintelligent that I came near dying lately. Yes, a dream, a beautiful\ndream!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no! a reality, the reality of your genius, master.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, lowering his voice almost to a whisper, he breathed this\nconfession:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen, I am going to say to you what I would say to no one else in\nthe world, what I would not say to myself aloud. To correct nature, to\ninterfere, in order to modify it and thwart it in its purpose, is this\na laudable task? To cure the individual, to retard his death, for his\npersonal pleasure, to prolong his existence, doubtless to the injury of\nthe species, is not this to defeat the aims of nature? And have we the\nright to desire a stronger, a healthier humanity, modeled after our idea\nof health and strength? What have we to do in the matter? Why should we\ninterfere in this work of life, neither the means nor the end of which\nare known to us? Perhaps everything is as it ought to be. Perhaps we\nshould risk killing love, genius, life itself. Remember, I make the\nconfession to you alone; but doubt has taken possession of me, I tremble\nat the thought of my twentieth century alchemy. I have come to believe\nthat it is greater and wiser to allow evolution to take its course.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe paused; then he added so softly that she could scarcely hear him:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know that instead of nerve-substance I often use only water with\nmy patients. You no longer hear me grinding for days at a time. I told\nyou that I had some of the liquor in reserve. Water soothes them,\nthis is no doubt simply a mechanical effect. Ah! to soothe, to prevent\nsuffering--that indeed I still desire! It is perhaps my greatest\nweakness, but I cannot bear to see any one suffer. Suffering puts me\nbeside myself, it seems a monstrous and useless cruelty of nature. I\npractise now only to prevent suffering.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen, master,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked, in the same indistinct murmur, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you no\nlonger desire to cure, do you still think everything must be told? For\nthe frightful necessity of displaying the wounds of humanity had no\nother excuse than the hope of curing them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes, it is necessary to know, in every case, and to conceal\nnothing; to tell everything regarding things and individuals. Happiness\nis no longer possible in ignorance; certainty alone makes life tranquil.\nWhen people know more they will doubtless accept everything. Do you not\ncomprehend that to desire to cure everything, to regenerate everything\nis a false ambition inspired by our egotism, a revolt against life,\nwhich we declare to be bad, because we judge it from the point of view\nof self-interest? I know that I am more tranquil, that my intellect has\nbroadened and deepened ever since I have held evolution in respect. It\nis my love of life which triumphs, even to the extent of not questioning\nits purpose, to the extent of confiding absolutely in it, of losing\nmyself in it, without wishing to remake it according to my own\nconception of good and evil. Life alone is sovereign, life alone knows\nits aim and its end. I can only try to know it in order to live it as it\nshould be lived. And this I have understood only since I have possessed\nyour love. Before I possessed it I sought the truth elsewhere, I\nstruggled with the fixed idea of saving the world. You have come, and\nlife is full; the world is saved every hour by love, by the immense and\nincessant labor of all that live and love throughout space. Impeccable\nlife, omnipotent life, immortal life!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey continued to talk together in low tones for some time longer,\nplanning an idyllic life, a calm and healthful existence in the country.\nIt was in this simple prescription of an invigorating environment that\nthe experiments of the physician ended. He exclaimed against cities.\nPeople could be well and happy only in the country, in the sunshine, on\nthe condition of renouncing money, ambition, even the proud excesses of\nintellectual labor. They should do nothing but live and love, cultivate\nthe soil, and bring up their children.\n\n\n\n\nIX.\n\nDr. Pascal then resumed his professional visits in the town and the\nsurrounding country. And he was generally accompanied by Clotilde,\nwho went with him into the houses of the poor, where she, too, brought\nhealth and cheerfulness.\n\nBut, as he had one night confessed to her in secret, his visits were now\nonly visits of relief and consolation. If he had before practised with\nrepugnance it was because he had felt how vain was medical science.\nEmpiricism disheartened him. From the moment that medicine ceased to be\nan experimental science and became an art, he was filled with disquiet\nat the thought of the infinite variety of diseases and of their\nremedies, according to the constitution of the patient. Treatment\nchanged with every new hypothesis; how many people, then, must the\nmethods now abandoned have killed! The perspicacity of the physician\nbecame everything, the healer was only a happily endowed diviner,\nhimself groping in the dark and effecting cures through his fortunate\nendowment. And this explained why he had given up his patients almost\naltogether, after a dozen years of practise, to devote himself entirely\nto study. Then, when his great labors on heredity had restored to him\nfor a time the hope of intervening and curing disease by his hypodermic\ninjections, he had become again enthusiastic, until the day when his\nfaith in life, after having impelled him, to aid its action in this way,\nby restoring the vital forces, became still broader and gave him the\nhigher conviction that life was self-sufficing, that it was the only\ngiver of health and strength, in spite of everything. And he continued\nto visit, with his tranquil smile, only those of his patients who\nclamored for him loudly, and who found themselves miraculously relieved\nwhen he injected into them only pure water.\n\nClotilde now sometimes allowed herself to jest about these hypodermic\ninjections. She was still at heart, however, a fervent worshiper of his\nskill; and she said jestingly that if he performed miracles as he did it\nwas because he had in himself the godlike power to do so. Then he would\nreply jestingly, attributing to her the efficacy of their common visits,\nsaying that he cured no one now when she was absent, that it was she\nwho brought the breath of life, the unknown and necessary force from the\nBeyond. So that the rich people, the _bourgeois_, whose houses she did\nnot enter, continued to groan without his being able to relieve them.\nAnd this affectionate dispute diverted them; they set out each time as\nif for new discoveries, they exchanged glances of kindly intelligence\nwith the sick. Ah, this wretched suffering which revolted them, and\nwhich was now all they went to combat; how happy they were when they\nthought it vanquished! They were divinely recompensed when they saw the\ncold sweats disappear, the moaning lips become stilled, the deathlike\nfaces recover animation. It was assuredly the love which they brought to\nthis humble, suffering humanity that produced the alleviation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo die is nothing; that is in the natural order of things,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pascal\nwould often say. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut why suffer? It is cruel and unnecessary!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOne afternoon the doctor was going with the young girl to the little\nvillage of Sainte-Marthe to see a patient, and at the station, for they\nwere going by train, so as to spare Bonhomme, they had a reencounter.\nThe train which they were waiting for was from the Tulettes.\nSainte-Marthe was the first station in the opposite direction, going to\nMarseilles. When the train arrived, they hurried on board and, opening\nthe door of a compartment which they thought empty, they saw old Mme.\nRougon about to leave it. She did not speak to them, but passing them\nby, sprang down quickly in spite of her age, and walked away with a\nstiff and haughty air.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the 1st of July,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Clotilde when the train had started.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGrandmother is returning from the Tulettes, after making her monthly\nvisit to Aunt Dide. Did you see the glance she cast at me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal was at heart glad of the quarrel with his mother, which freed him\nfrom the continual annoyance of her visits.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said simply, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen people cannot agree it is better for them\nnot to see each other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the young girl remained troubled and thoughtful. After a few moments\nshe said in an undertone:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought her changed--looking paler. And did you notice? she who is\nusually so carefully dressed had only one glove on--a yellow glove, on\nthe right hand. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why it was, but she made me feel sick at\nheart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal, who was also disturbed, made a vague gesture. His mother would\nno doubt grow old at last, like everybody else. But she was very active,\nvery full of fire still. She was thinking, he said, of bequeathing\nher fortune to the town of Plassans, to build a house of refuge, which\nshould bear the name of Rougon. Both had recovered their gaiety when he\ncried suddenly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, it is to-morrow that you and I are to go to the Tulettes to see\nour patients. And you know that I promised to take Charles to Uncle\nMacquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite was in fact returning from the Tulettes, where she went\nregularly on the first of every month to inquire after Aunt Dide. For\nmany years past she had taken a keen interest in the madwoman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health,\namazed to see her lasting so long, and furious with her for persisting\nin living so far beyond the common term of life, until she had become a\nvery prodigy of longevity. What a relief, the fine morning on which\nthey should put under ground this troublesome witness of the past, this\nspecter of expiation and of waiting, who brought living before her the\nabominations of the family! When so many others had been taken she, who\nwas demented and who had only a spark of life left in her eyes, seemed\nforgotten. On this day she had found her as usual, skeleton-like, stiff\nand erect in her armchair. As the keeper said, there was now no reason\nwhy she should ever die. She was a hundred and five years old.\n\nWhen she left the asylum Felicite was furious. She thought of Uncle\nMacquart. Another who troubled her, who persisted in living with\nexasperating obstinacy! Although he was only eighty-four years old,\nthree years older than herself, she thought him ridiculously aged, past\nthe allotted term of life. And a man who led so dissipated a life, who\nhad gone to bed dead drunk every night for the last sixty years!\nThe good and the sober were taken away; he flourished in spite of\neverything, blooming with health and gaiety. In days past, just after\nhe had settled at the Tulettes, she had made him presents of wines,\nliqueurs and brandy, in the unavowed hope of ridding the family of a\nfellow who was really disreputable, and from whom they had nothing to\nexpect but annoyance and shame. But she had soon perceived that all this\nliquor served, on the contrary, to keep up his health and spirits and\nhis sarcastic humor, and she had left off making him presents, seeing\nthat he throve on what she had hoped would prove a poison to him. She\nhad cherished a deadly hatred toward him since then. She would have\nkilled him if she had dared, every time she saw him, standing firmly on\nhis drunken legs, and laughing at her to her face, knowing well that she\nwas watching for his death, and triumphant because he did not give her\nthe pleasure of burying with him all the old dirty linen of the family,\nthe blood and mud of the two conquests of Plassans.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see, Felicite,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would often say to her with his air of wicked\nmockery, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am here to take care of the old mother, and the day on\nwhich we both make up our minds to die it would be through compliment\nto you--yes, simply to spare you the trouble of running to see us so\ngood-naturedly, in this way, every month.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGenerally she did not now give herself the disappointment of going to\nMacquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, but inquired for him at the asylum. But on this occasion,\nhaving learned there that he was passing through an extraordinary attack\nof drunkenness, not having drawn a sober breath for a fortnight, and\nso intoxicated that he was probably unable to leave the house, she was\nseized with the curiosity to learn for herself what his condition really\nwas. And as she was going back to the station, she went out of her way\nin order to stop at Macquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house.\n\nThe day was superb--a warm and brilliant summer day. On either side of\nthe path which she had taken, she saw the fields that she had given him\nin former days--all this fertile land, the price of his secrecy and his\ngood behavior. Before her appeared the house, with its pink tiles and\nits bright yellow walls, looking gay in the sunshine. Under the ancient\nmulberry trees on the terrace she enjoyed the delightful coolness and\nthe beautiful view. What a pleasant and safe retreat, what a happy\nsolitude was this for an old man to end in joy and peace a long and\nwell-spent life!\n\nBut she did not see him, she did not hear him. The silence was profound.\nThe only sound to be heard was the humming of the bees circling around\nthe tall marshmallows. And on the terrace there was nothing to be seen\nbut a little yellow dog, stretched at full length on the bare ground,\nseeking the coolness of the shade. He raised his head growling, about to\nbark, but, recognizing the visitor, he lay down again quietly.\n\nThen, in this peaceful and sunny solitude she was seized with a strange\nchill, and she called:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMacquart! Macquart!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe door of the house under the mulberry trees stood wide open. But she\ndid not dare to go in; this empty house with its wide open door gave her\na vague uneasiness. And she called again:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMacquart! Macquart!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNot a sound, not a breath. Profound silence reigned again, but the\nhumming of the bees circling around the tall marshmallows sounded louder\nthan before.\n\nAt last Felicite, ashamed of her fears, summoned courage to enter. The\ndoor on the left of the hall, opening into the kitchen, where Uncle\nMacquart generally sat, was closed. She pushed it open, but she could\ndistinguish nothing at first, as the blinds had been closed, probably\nin order to shut out the heat. Her first sensation was one of choking,\ncaused by an overpowering odor of alcohol which filled the room; every\narticle of furniture seemed to exude this odor, the whole house was\nimpregnated with it. At last, when her eyes had become accustomed to the\nsemi-obscurity, she perceived Macquart. He was seated at the table,\non which were a glass and a bottle of spirits of thirty-six degrees,\ncompletely empty. Settled in his chair, he was sleeping profoundly, dead\ndrunk. This spectacle revived her anger and contempt.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, Macquart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis it not vile and senseless to put one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nself in such a state! Wake up, I say, this is shameful!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis sleep was so profound that she could not even hear him breathing. In\nvain she raised her voice, and slapped him smartly on the hands.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMacquart! Macquart! Macquart! Ah, faugh! You are disgusting, my dear!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen she left him, troubling herself no further about him, and walked\naround the room, evidently seeking something. Coming down the dusky road\nfrom the asylum she had been seized with a consuming thirst, and she\nwished to get a glass of water. Her gloves embarrassed her, and she took\nthem off and put them on a corner of the table. Then she succeeded in\nfinding the jug, and she washed a glass and filled it to the brim, and\nwas about to empty it when she saw an extraordinary sight--a sight which\nagitated her so greatly that she set the glass down again beside her\ngloves, without drinking.\n\nBy degrees she had begun to see objects more clearly in the room, which\nwas lighted dimly by a few stray sunbeams that filtered through the\ncracks of the old shutters. She now saw Uncle Macquart distinctly,\nneatly dressed in a blue cloth suit, as usual, and on his head the\neternal fur cap which he wore from one year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end to the other. He had\ngrown stout during the last five or six years, and he looked like a\nveritable mountain of flesh overlaid with rolls of fat. And she noticed\nthat he must have fallen asleep while smoking, for his pipe--a short\nblack pipe--had fallen into his lap. Then she stood still, stupefied\nwith amazement--the burning tobacco had been scattered in the fall, and\nthe cloth of the trousers had caught fire, and through a hole in the\nstuff, as large already as a hundred-sous piece, she saw the bare thigh,\nwhence issued a little blue flame.\n\nAt first Felicite had thought that it was linen--the drawers or the\nshirt--that was burning. But soon doubt was no longer possible, she saw\ndistinctly the bare flesh and the little blue flame issuing from it,\nlightly dancing, like a flame wandering over the surface of a vessel of\nlighted alcohol. It was as yet scarcely higher than the flame of a night\nlight, pale and soft, and so unstable that the slightest breath of air\ncaused it to change its place. But it increased and spread rapidly, and\nthe skin cracked and the fat began to melt.\n\nAn involuntary cry escaped from Felicite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s throat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMacquart! Macquart!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut still he did not stir. His insensibility must have been complete;\nintoxication must have produced a sort of coma, in which there was an\nabsolute paralysis of sensation, for he was living, his breast could be\nseen rising and falling, in slow and even respiration.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMacquart! Macquart!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNow the fat was running through the cracks of the skin, feeding the\nflame, which was invading the abdomen. And Felicite comprehended vaguely\nthat Uncle Macquart was burning before her like a sponge soaked with\nbrandy. He had, indeed, been saturated with it for years past, and\nof the strongest and most inflammable kind. He would no doubt soon be\nblazing from head to foot, like a bowl of punch.\n\nThen she ceased to try to awaken him, since he was sleeping so soundly.\nFor a full minute she had the courage to look at him, awe-stricken,\nbut gradually coming to a determination. Her hands, however, began\nto tremble, with a little shiver which she could not control. She was\nchoking, and taking up the glass of water again with both hands, she\nemptied it at a draught. And she was going away on tiptoe, when she\nremembered her gloves. She went back, groped for them anxiously on the\ntable and, as she thought, picked them both up. Then she left the room,\nclosing the door behind her carefully, and as gently as if she were\nafraid of disturbing some one.\n\nWhen she found herself once more on the terrace, in the cheerful\nsunshine and the pure air, in face of the vast horizon bathed in light,\nshe heaved a sigh of relief. The country was deserted; no one could have\nseen her entering or leaving the house. Only the yellow dog was still\nstretched there, and he did not even deign to look up. And she went\naway with her quick, short step, her youthful figure lightly swaying. A\nhundred steps away, an irresistible impulse compelled her to turn round\nto give a last look at the house, so tranquil and so cheerful on the\nhillside, in the declining light of the beautiful day.\n\nOnly when she was in the train and went to put on her gloves did she\nperceive that one of them was missing. But she supposed that it had\nfallen on the platform at the station as she was getting into the car.\nShe believed herself to be quite calm, but she remained with one hand\ngloved and one hand bare, which, with her, could only be the result of\ngreat agitation.\n\nOn the following day Pascal and Clotilde took the three o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock train to\ngo to the Tulettes. The mother of Charles, the harness-maker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife,\nhad brought the boy to them, as they had offered to take him to Uncle\nMacquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, where he was to remain for the rest of the week. Fresh\nquarrels had disturbed the peace of the household, the husband having\nresolved to tolerate no longer in his house another man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s child, that\ndo-nothing, imbecile prince\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son. As it was Grandmother Rougon who had\ndressed him, he was, indeed, dressed on this day, again, in black velvet\ntrimmed with gold braid, like a young lord, a page of former times going\nto court. And during the quarter of an hour which the journey lasted,\nClotilde amused herself in the compartment, in which they were alone,\nby taking off his cap and smoothing his beautiful blond locks, his\nroyal hair that fell in curls over his shoulders. She had a ring on her\nfinger, and as she passed her hand over his neck she was startled to\nperceive that her caress had left behind it a trace of blood. One\ncould not touch the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skin without the red dew exuding from it;\nthe tissues had become so lax through extreme degeneration that the\nslightest scratch brought on a hemorrhage. The doctor became at once\nuneasy, and asked him if he still bled at the nose as frequently as\nformerly. Charles hardly knew what to answer; first saying no, then,\nrecollecting himself, he said that he had bled a great deal the other\nday. He seemed, indeed, weaker; he grew more childish as he grew older;\nhis intelligence, which had never developed, had become clouded. This\ntall boy of fifteen, so beautiful, so girlish-looking, with the color of\na flower that had grown in the shade, did not look ten.\n\nAt the Tulettes Pascal decided that they would first take the boy to\nUncle Macquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. They ascended the steep road. In the distance the\nlittle house looked gay in the sunshine, as it had looked on the day\nbefore, with its yellow walls and its green mulberry trees extending\ntheir twisted branches and covering the terrace with a thick, leafy\nroof. A delightful sense of peace pervaded this solitary spot, this\nsage\u00e2\u0080\u0099s retreat, where the only sound to be heard was the humming of the\nbees, circling round the tall marshmallows.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, that rascal of an uncle!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Pascal, smiling, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow I envy him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut he was surprised not to have already seen him standing at the edge\nof the terrace. And as Charles had run off dragging Clotilde with him to\nsee the rabbits, as he said, the doctor continued the ascent alone, and\nwas astonished when he reached the top to see no one. The blinds were\nclosed, the hill door yawned wide open. Only the yellow dog was at the\nthreshold, his legs stiff, his hair bristling, howling with a low and\ncontinuous moan. When he saw the visitor, whom he no doubt recognized,\napproaching, he stopped howling for an instant and went and stood\nfurther off, then he began again to whine softly.\n\nPascal, filled with apprehension, could not keep back the uneasy cry\nthat rose to his lips:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMacquart! Macquart!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNo one answered; a deathlike silence reigned over the house, with its\ndoor yawning wide open, like the mouth of a cavern. The dog continued to\nhowl.\n\nThen Pascal grew impatient, and cried more loudly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMacquart! Macquart!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was not a stir; the bees hummed, the sky looked down serenely on\nthe peaceful scene. Then he hesitated no longer. Perhaps Macquart was\nasleep. But the instant he pushed open the door of the kitchen on the\nleft of the hall, a horrible odor escaped from it, an odor of burned\nflesh and bones. When he entered the room he could hardly breathe, so\nfilled was it by a thick vapor, a stagnant and nauseous cloud, which\nchoked and blinded him. The sunbeams that filtered through the cracks\nmade only a dim light. He hurried to the fireplace, thinking that\nperhaps there had been a fire, but the fireplace was empty, and the\narticles of furniture around appeared to be uninjured. Bewildered, and\nfeeling himself growing faint in the poisoned atmosphere, he ran to the\nwindow and threw the shutters wide open. A flood of light entered.\n\nThen the scene presented to the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view filled him with amazement.\nEverything was in its place; the glass and the empty bottle of spirits\nwere on the table; only the chair in which Uncle Macquart must have been\nsitting bore traces of fire, the front legs were blackened and the straw\nwas partially consumed. What had become of Macquart? Where could he\nhave disappeared? In front of the chair, on the brick floor, which was\nsaturated with grease, there was a little heap of ashes, beside which\nlay the pipe--a black pipe, which had not even broken in falling. All of\nUncle Macquart was there, in this handful of fine ashes; and he was in\nthe red cloud, also, which floated through the open window; in the layer\nof soot which carpeted the entire kitchen; the horrible grease of burnt\nflesh, enveloping everything, sticky and foul to the touch.\n\nIt was the finest case of spontaneous combustion physician had ever\nseen. The doctor had, indeed, read in medical papers of surprising\ncases, among others that of a shoemaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife, a drunken woman who had\nfallen asleep over her foot warmer, and of whom they had found only\na hand and foot. He had, until now, put little faith in these cases,\nunwilling to admit, like the ancients, that a body impregnated\nwith alcohol could disengage an unknown gas, capable of taking fire\nspontaneously and consuming the flesh and the bones. But he denied the\ntruth of them no longer; besides, everything became clear to him as\nhe reconstructed the scene--the coma of drunkenness producing absolute\ninsensibility; the pipe falling on the clothes, which had taken fire;\nthe flesh, saturated with liquor, burning and cracking; the fat melting,\npart of it running over the ground and part of it aiding the combustion,\nand all, at last--muscles, organs, and bones--consumed in a general\nblaze. Uncle Macquart was all there, with his blue cloth suit, and his\nfur cap, which he wore from one year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end to the other. Doubtless, as\nsoon as he had begun to burn like a bonfire he had fallen forward, which\nwould account for the chair being only blackened; and nothing of him was\nleft, not a bone, not a tooth, not a nail, nothing but this little heap\nof gray dust which the draught of air from the door threatened at every\nmoment to sweep away.\n\nClotilde had meanwhile entered, Charles remaining outside, his attention\nattracted by the continued howling of the dog.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood Heavens, what a smell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen Pascal explained to her the extraordinary catastrophe that had\ntaken place, she shuddered. She took up the bottle to examine it, but\nshe put it down again with horror, feeling it moist and sticky with\nUncle Macquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flesh. Nothing could be touched, the smallest objects\nwere coated, as it were, with this yellowish grease which stuck to the\nhands.\n\nA shudder of mingled awe and disgust passed through her, and she burst\ninto tears, faltering:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a sad death! What a horrible death!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal had recovered from his first shock, and he was almost smiling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy horrible? He was eighty-four years old; he did not suffer. As for\nme, I think it a superb death for that old rascal of an uncle, who, it\nmay be now said, did not lead a very exemplary life. You remember his\nenvelope; he had some very terrible and vile things upon his conscience,\nwhich did not prevent him, however, from settling down later and growing\nold, surrounded by every comfort, like an old humbug, receiving the\nrecompense of virtues which he did not possess. And here he lies like\nthe prince of drunkards, burning up of himself, consumed on the burning\nfuneral pile of his own body!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd the doctor waved his hand in admiration.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust think of it. To be drunk to the point of not feeling that one is\non fire; to set one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self aflame, like a bonfire on St. John\u00e2\u0080\u0099s day; to\ndisappear in smoke to the last bone. Think of Uncle Macquart starting\non his journey through space; first diffused through the four corners of\nthe room, dissolved in air and floating about, bathing all that belonged\nto him; then escaping in a cloud of dust through the window, when I\nopened it for him, soaring up into the sky, filling the horizon. Why,\nthat is an admirable death! To disappear, to leave nothing of himself\nbehind but a little heap of ashes and a pipe beside it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he picked up the pipe to keep it, as he said, as a relic of Uncle\nMacquart; while Clotilde, who thought she perceived a touch of bitter\nmockery in his eulogistic rhapsody, shuddered anew with horror and\ndisgust. But suddenly she perceived something under the table--part of\nthe remains, perhaps.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook at that fragment there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe stooped down and picked up with surprise a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glove, a yellow\nglove.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glove; the glove that was missing\nlast evening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey looked at each other; by a common impulse the same explanation\nrose to their lips, Felicite was certainly there yesterday; and a sudden\nconviction forced itself on the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind--the conviction that his\nmother had seen Uncle Macquart burning and that she had not quenched\nhim. Various indications pointed to this--the state of complete coolness\nin which he found the room, the number of hours which he calculated to\nhave been necessary for the combustion of the body. He saw clearly the\nsame thought dawning in the terrified eyes of his companion. But as it\nseemed impossible that they should ever know the truth, he fabricated\naloud the simplest explanation:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo doubt your grandmother came in yesterday on her way back from\nthe asylum, to say good day to Uncle Macquart, before he had begun\ndrinking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us go away! let us go away!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Clotilde. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am stifling here; I\ncannot remain here!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal, too, wished to go and give information of the death. He went out\nafter her, shut up the house, and put the key in his pocket. Outside,\nthey heard the little yellow dog still howling. He had taken refuge\nbetween Charles\u00e2\u0080\u0099 legs, and the boy amused himself pushing him with his\nfoot and listening to him whining, without comprehending.\n\nThe doctor went at once to the house of M. Maurin, the notary at the\nTulettes, who was also mayor of the commune. A widower for ten years\npast, and living with his daughter, who was a childless widow, he had\nmaintained neighborly relations with old Macquart, and had occasionally\nkept little Charles with him for several days at a time, his daughter\nhaving become interested in the boy who was so handsome and so much\nto be pitied. M. Maurin, horrified at the news, went at once with the\ndoctor to draw up a statement of the accident, and promised to make out\nthe death certificate in due form. As for religious ceremonies, funeral\nobsequies, they seemed scarcely possible. When they entered the kitchen\nthe draught from the door scattered the ashes about, and when they\npiously attempted to collect them again they succeeded only in gathering\ntogether the scrapings of the flags, a collection of accumulated dirt,\nin which there could be but little of Uncle Macquart. What, then,\ncould they bury? It was better to give up the idea. So they gave it\nup. Besides, Uncle Macquart had been hardly a devout Catholic, and the\nfamily contented themselves with causing masses to be said later on for\nthe repose of his soul.\n\nThe notary, meantime, had immediately declared that there existed a\nwill, which had been deposited with him, and he asked Pascal to meet him\nat his house on the next day but one for the reading; for he thought he\nmight tell the doctor at once that Uncle Macquart had chosen him as\nhis executor. And he ended by offering, like a kindhearted man, to keep\nCharles with him until then, comprehending how greatly the boy, who was\nso unwelcome at his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, would be in the way in the midst of all\nthese occurrences. Charles seemed enchanted, and he remained at the\nTulettes.\n\nIt was not until very late, until seven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, that Clotilde and\nPascal were able to take the train to return to Plassans, after the\ndoctor had at last visited the two patients whom he had to see. But\nwhen they returned together to the notary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on the day appointed for the\nmeeting, they had the disagreeable surprise of finding old Mme. Rougon\ninstalled there. She had naturally learned of Macquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, and had\nhurried there on the following day, full of excitement, and making a\ngreat show of grief; and she had just made her appearance again to-day,\nhaving heard the famous testament spoken of. The reading of the will,\nhowever, was a simple matter, unmarked by any incident. Macquart\nhad left all the fortune that he could dispose of for the purpose of\nerecting a superb marble monument to himself, with two angels with\nfolded wings, weeping. It was his own idea, a reminiscence of a similar\ntomb which he had seen abroad--in Germany, perhaps--when he was a\nsoldier. And he had charged his nephew Pascal to superintend the\nerection of the monument, as he was the only one of the family, he said,\nwho had any taste.\n\nDuring the reading of the will Clotilde had remained in the notary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ngarden, sitting on a bench under the shade of an ancient chestnut tree.\nWhen Pascal and Felicite again appeared, there was a moment of great\nembarrassment, for they had not spoken to one another for some months\npast. The old lady, however, affected to be perfectly at her ease,\nmaking no allusion whatever to the new situation, and giving it to be\nunderstood that they might very well meet and appear united before the\nworld, without for that reason entering into an explanation or becoming\nreconciled. But she committed the mistake of laying too much stress\non the great grief which Macquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death had caused her. Pascal, who\nsuspected the overflowing joy, the unbounded delight which it gave her\nto think that this family ulcer was to be at last healed, that this\nabominable uncle was at last out of the way, became gradually possessed\nby an impatience, an indignation, which he could not control. His eyes\nfastened themselves involuntarily on his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gloves, which were\nblack.\n\nJust then she was expressing her grief in lowered tones:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut how imprudent it was, at his age, to persist in living alone--like\na wolf in his lair! If he had only had a servant in the house with him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen the doctor, hardly conscious of what he was saying, terrified at\nhearing himself say the words, but impelled by an irresistible force,\nsaid:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, mother, since you were there, why did you not quench him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOld Mme. Rougon turned frightfully pale. How could her son have known?\nShe looked at him for an instant in open-mouthed amazement; while\nClotilde grew as pale as she, in the certainty of the crime, which was\nnow evident. It was an avowal, this terrified silence which had fallen\nbetween the mother, the son, and the granddaughter--the shuddering\nsilence in which families bury their domestic tragedies. The doctor, in\ndespair at having spoken, he who avoided so carefully all disagreeable\nand useless explanations, was trying desperately to retract his words,\nwhen a new catastrophe extricated him from his terrible embarrassment.\n\nFelicite desired to take Charles away with her, in order not to trespass\non the notary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind hospitality; and as the latter had sent the boy\nafter breakfast to spend an hour or two with Aunt Dide, he had sent the\nmaid servant to the asylum with orders to bring him back immediately. It\nwas at this juncture that the servant, whom they were waiting for in the\ngarden, made her appearance, covered with perspiration, out of breath,\nand greatly excited, crying from a distance:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy God! My God! come quickly. Master Charles is bathed in blood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFilled with consternation, all three set off for the asylum. This day\nchanced to be one of Aunt Dide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good days; very calm and gentle she sat\nerect in the armchair in which she had spent the hours, the long hours\nfor twenty-two years past, looking straight before her into vacancy. She\nseemed to have grown still thinner, all the flesh had disappeared, her\nlimbs were now only bones covered with parchment-like skin; and her\nkeeper, the stout fair-haired girl, carried her, fed her, took her\nup and laid her down as if she had been a bundle. The ancestress, the\nforgotten one, tall, bony, ghastly, remained motionless, her eyes, only\nseeming to have life, her eyes shining clear as spring water in her thin\nwithered face. But on this morning, again a sudden rush of tears had\nstreamed down her cheeks, and she had begun to stammer words without\nany connection; which seemed to prove that in the midst of her senile\nexhaustion and the incurable torpor of madness, the slow induration of\nthe brain and the limbs was not yet complete; there still were memories\nstored away, gleams of intelligence still were possible. Then her face\nhad resumed its vacant expression. She seemed indifferent to every one\nand everything, laughing, sometimes, at an accident, at a fall, but most\noften seeing nothing and hearing nothing, gazing fixedly into vacancy.\n\nWhen Charles had been brought to her the keeper had immediately\ninstalled him before the little table, in front of his\ngreat-great-grandmother. The girl kept a package of pictures for\nhim--soldiers, captains, kings clad in purple and gold, and she gave\nthem to him with a pair of scissors, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere, amuse yourself quietly, and behave well. You see that to-day\ngrandmother is very good. You must be good, too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe boy raised his eyes to the madwoman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, and both looked at each\nother. At this moment the resemblance between them was extraordinary.\nTheir eyes, especially, their vacant and limpid eyes, seemed to lose\nthemselves in one another, to be identical. Then it was the physiognomy,\nthe whole face, the worn features of the centenarian, that passed over\nthree generations to this delicate child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, it, too, worn already,\nas it were, and aged by the wear of the race. Neither smiled, they\nregarded each other intently, with an air of grave imbecility.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the keeper, who had acquired the habit of talking to\nherself to cheer herself when with her mad charge, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou cannot deny each\nother. The same hand made you both. You are the very spit-down of\neach other. Come, laugh a bit, amuse yourselves, since you like to be\ntogether.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut to fix his attention for any length of time fatigued Charles, and\nhe was the first to lower his eyes; he seemed to be interested in his\npictures, while Aunt Dide, who had an astonishing power of fixing her\nattention, as if she had been turned into stone, continued to look at\nhim fixedly, without even winking an eyelid.\n\nThe keeper busied herself for a few moments in the little sunny room,\nmade gay by its light, blue-flowered paper. She made the bed which she\nhad been airing, she arranged the linen on the shelves of the press.\nBut she generally profited by the presence of the boy to take a little\nrelaxation. She had orders never to leave her charge alone, and now that\nhe was here she ventured to trust her with him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen to me well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she went on, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have to go out for a little, and if\nshe stirs, if she should need me, ring for me, call me at once; do you\nhear? You understand, you are a big enough boy to be able to call one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe had looked up again, and made a sign that he had understood and that\nhe would call her. And when he found himself alone with Aunt Dide he\nreturned to his pictures quietly. This lasted for a quarter of an hour\namid the profound silence of the asylum, broken only at intervals by\nsome prison sound--a stealthy step, the jingling of a bunch of keys,\nand occasionally a loud cry, immediately silenced. But the boy must have\nbeen tired by the excessive heat of the day, for sleep gradually stole\nover him. Soon his head, fair as a lily, drooped, and as if weighed down\nby the too heavy casque of his royal locks, he let it sink gently on the\npictures and fell asleep, with his cheek resting on the gold and purple\nkings. The lashes of his closed eyelids cast a shadow on his delicate\nskin, with its small blue veins, through which life pulsed feebly. He\nwas beautiful as an angel, but with the indefinable corruption of a\nwhole race spread over his countenance. And Aunt Dide looked at him with\nher vacant stare in which there was neither pleasure nor pain, the stare\nof eternity contemplating things earthly.\n\nAt the end of a few moments, however, an expression of interest seemed\nto dawn in the clear eyes. Something had just happened, a drop of blood\nwas forming on the edge of the left nostril of the boy. This drop fell\nand another formed and followed it. It was the blood, the dew of blood,\nexuding this time, without a scratch, without a bruise, which issued\nand flowed of itself in the laxity of the degenerate tissues. The drops\nbecame a slender thread which flowed over the gold of the pictures. A\nlittle pool covered them, and made its way to a corner of the table;\nthen the drops began again, splashing dully one by one upon the floor.\nAnd he still slept, with the divinely calm look of a cherub, not even\nconscious of the life that was escaping from him; and the madwoman\ncontinued to look at him, with an air of increasing interest, but\nwithout terror, amused, rather, her attention engaged by this, as by the\nflight of the big flies, which her gaze often followed for hours.\n\nSeveral minutes more passed, the slender thread had grown larger, the\ndrops followed one another more rapidly, falling on the floor with a\nmonotonous and persistent drip. And Charles, at one moment, stirred,\nopened his eyes, and perceived that he was covered with blood. But\nhe was not frightened; he was accustomed to this bloody spring, which\nissued from him at the slightest cause. He merely gave a sigh of\nweariness. Instinct, however, must have warned him, for he moaned more\nloudly than before, and called confusedly in stammering accents:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMamma! mamma!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis weakness was no doubt already excessive, for an irresistible stupor\nonce more took possession of him, his head dropped, his eyes closed, and\nhe seemed to fall asleep again, continuing his plaint, as if in a dream,\nmoaning in fainter and fainter accents:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMamma! mamma!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNow the pictures were inundated; the black velvet jacket and trousers,\nbraided with gold, were stained with long streaks of blood, and the\nlittle red stream began again to flow persistently from his left\nnostril, without stopping, crossed the red pool on the table and fell\nupon the ground, where it at last formed a veritable lake. A loud cry\nfrom the madwoman, a terrified call would have sufficed. But she did\nnot cry, she did not call; motionless, rigid, emaciated, sitting there\nforgotten of the world, she gazed with the fixed look of the ancestress\nwho sees the destinies of her race being accomplished. She sat there as\nif dried up, bound; her limbs and her tongue tied by her hundred years,\nher brain ossified by madness, incapable of willing or of acting. And\nyet the sight of the little red stream began to stir some feeling in\nher. A tremor passed over her deathlike countenance, a flush mounted to\nher cheeks. Finally, a last plaint roused her completely:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMamma! mamma!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen it was evident that a terrible struggle was taking place in Aunt\nDide. She carried her skeleton-like hand to her forehead as if she felt\nher brain bursting. Her mouth was wide open, but no sound issued\nfrom it; the dreadful tumult that had arisen within her had no doubt\nparalyzed her tongue. She tried to rise, to run, but she had no longer\nany muscles; she remained fastened to her seat. All her poor body\ntrembled in the superhuman effort which she was making to cry for help,\nwithout being able to break the bonds of old age and madness which\nheld her prisoner. Her face was distorted with terror; memory gradually\nawakening, she must have comprehended everything.\n\nAnd it was a slow and gentle agony, of which the spectacle lasted for\nseveral minutes more. Charles, silent now, as if he had again fallen\nasleep, was losing the last drops of blood that had remained in his\nveins, which were emptying themselves softly. His lily-like whiteness\nincreased until it became a deathlike pallor. His lips lost their rosy\ncolor, became a pale pink, then white. And, as he was about to expire,\nhe opened his large eyes and fixed them on his great-great-grandmother,\nwho watched the light dying in them. All the waxen face was already\ndead, the eyes only were still living. They still kept their limpidity,\ntheir brightness. All at once they became vacant, the light in them was\nextinguished. This was the end--the death of the eyes, and Charles had\ndied, without a struggle, exhausted, like a fountain from which all\nthe water has run out. Life no longer pulsed through the veins of his\ndelicate skin, there was now only the shadow of its wings on his white\nface. But he remained divinely beautiful, his face lying in blood,\nsurrounded by his royal blond locks, like one of those little bloodless\ndauphins who, unable to bear the execrable heritage of their race, die\nof decrepitude and imbecility at sixteen.\n\nThe boy exhaled his latest breath as Dr. Pascal entered the room,\nfollowed by Felicite and Clotilde. And when he saw the quantity of blood\nthat inundated the floor, he cried:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, my God! it is as I feared, a hemorrhage from the nose! The poor\ndarling, no one was with him, and it is all over!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut all three were struck with terror at the extraordinary spectacle\nthat now met their gaze. Aunt Dide, who seemed to have grown taller, in\nthe superhuman effort she was making, had almost succeeded in raising\nherself up, and her eyes, fixed on the dead boy, so fair and so gentle,\nand on the red sea of blood, beginning to congeal, that was lying around\nhim, kindled with a thought, after a long sleep of twenty-two years.\nThis final lesion of madness, this irremediable darkness of the mind,\nwas evidently not so complete but that some memory of the past, lying\nhidden there, might awaken suddenly under the terrible blow which had\nstruck her. And the ancestress, the forgotten one, lived again, emerged\nfrom her oblivion, rigid and wasted, like a specter of terror and grief.\n\nFor an instant she remained panting. Then with a shudder, which made her\nteeth chatter, she stammered a single phrase:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe _gendarme_! the _gendarme_!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal and Felicite and Clotilde understood. They looked at one another\ninvoluntarily, turning very pale. The whole dreadful history of the old\nmother--of the mother of them all--rose before them, the ardent love\nof her youth, the long suffering of her mature age. Already two moral\nshocks had shaken her terribly--the first, when she was in her ardent\nprime, when a _gendarme_ shot down her lover Macquart, the smuggler,\nlike a dog; the second, years ago, when another _gendarme_ shattered\nwith a pistol shot the skull of her grandson Silvere, the insurgent, the\nvictim of the hatred and the sanguinary strife of the family. Blood\nhad always bespattered her. And a third moral shock finished her; blood\nbespattered her again, the impoverished blood of her race, which she\nhad just beheld flowing slowly, and which lay upon the ground, while the\nfair royal child, his veins and his heart empty, slept.\n\nThree times--face to face with her past life, her life red with passion\nand suffering, haunted by the image of expiation--she stammered:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe _gendarme_! the _gendarme_! the _gendarme_!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen she sank back into her armchair. They thought she was dead, killed\nby the shock.\n\nBut the keeper at this moment at last appeared, endeavoring to excuse\nherself, fearing that she would be dismissed. When, aided by her, Dr.\nPascal had placed Aunt Dide on the bed, he found that the old mother was\nstill alive. She was not to die until the following day, at the age of\none hundred and five years, three months, and seven days, of congestion\nof the brain, caused by the last shock she had received.\n\nPascal, turning to his mother, said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe will not live twenty-four hours; to-morrow she will be dead. Ah!\nUncle Macquart, then she, and this poor boy, one after another. How much\nmisery and grief!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe paused and added in a lower tone:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe family is thinning out; the old trees fall and the young die\nstanding.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite must have thought this another allusion. She was sincerely\nshocked by the tragic death of little Charles. But, notwithstanding,\nabove the horror which she felt there arose a sense of immense relief.\nNext week, when they should have ceased to weep, what a rest to be able\nto say to herself that all this abomination of the Tulettes was at an\nend, that the family might at last rise, and shine in history!\n\nThen she remembered that she had not answered the involuntary accusation\nmade against her by her son at the notary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; and she spoke again of\nMacquart, through bravado:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see now that servants are of no use. There was one here, and yet\nshe prevented nothing; it would have been useless for Uncle Macquart\nto have had one to take care of him; he would be in ashes now, all the\nsame.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe sighed, and then continued in a broken voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well, neither our own fate nor that of others is in our hands;\nthings happen as they will. These are great blows that have fallen upon\nus. We must only trust to God for the preservation and the prosperity of\nour family.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDr. Pascal bowed with his habitual air of deference and said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are right, mother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde knelt down. Her former fervent Catholic faith had revived in\nthis chamber of blood, of madness, and of death. Tears streamed down her\ncheeks, and with clasped hands she was praying fervently for the dear\nones who were no more. She prayed that God would grant that their\nsufferings might indeed be ended, their faults pardoned, and that they\nmight live again in another life, a life of unending happiness. And she\nprayed with the utmost fervor, in her terror of a hell, which after this\nmiserable life would make suffering eternal.\n\nFrom this day Pascal and Clotilde went to visit their sick side by side,\nfilled with greater pity than ever. Perhaps, with Pascal, the feeling\nof his powerlessness against inevitable disease was even stronger than\nbefore. The only wisdom was to let nature take its course, to eliminate\ndangerous elements, and to labor only in the supreme work of giving\nhealth and strength. But the suffering and the death of those who are\ndear to us awaken in us a hatred of disease, an irresistible desire to\ncombat and to vanquish it. And the doctor never tasted so great a joy\nas when he succeeded, with his hypodermic injections, in soothing a\nparoxysm of pain, in seeing the groaning patient grow tranquil and fall\nasleep. Clotilde, in return, adored him, proud of their love, as if it\nwere a consolation which they carried, like the viaticum, to the poor.\n\n\n\n\nX.\n\nMartine one morning obtained from Dr. Pascal, as she did every three\nmonths, his receipt for fifteen hundred francs, to take it to the notary\nGrandguillot, to get from him what she called their \u00e2\u0080\u009cincome.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The doctor\nseemed surprised that the payment should have fallen due again so soon;\nhe had never been so indifferent as he was now about money matters,\nleaving to Martine the care of settling everything. And he and Clotilde\nwere under the plane trees, absorbed in the joy that filled their life,\nlulled by the ceaseless song of the fountain, when the servant returned\nwith a frightened face, and in a state of extraordinary agitation. She\nwas so breathless with excitement that for a moment she could not speak.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, my God! Oh, my God!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried at last. \u00e2\u0080\u009cM. Grandguillot has gone\naway!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal did not at first comprehend.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, my girl, there is no hurry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou can go back another\nday.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no! He has gone away; don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you hear? He has gone away forever--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd as the waters rush forth in the bursting of a dam, her emotion\nvented itself in a torrent of words.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI reached the street, and I saw from a distance a crowd gathered\nbefore the door. A chill ran through me; I felt that some misfortune\nhad happened. The door closed, and not a blind open, as if there was\nsomebody dead in the house. They told me when I got there that he had\nrun away; that he had not left a sou behind him; that many families\nwould be ruined.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe laid the receipt on the stone table.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere! There is your paper! It is all over with us, we have not a sou\nleft, we are going to die of starvation!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And she sobbed aloud in the\nanguish of her miserly heart, distracted by this loss of a fortune, and\ntrembling at the prospect of impending want.\n\nClotilde sat stunned and speechless, her eyes fixed on Pascal, whose\npredominating feeling at first seemed to be one of incredulity. He\nendeavored to calm Martine. Why! why! it would not do to give up in\nthis way. If all she knew of the affair was what she had heard from the\npeople in the street, it might be only gossip, after all, which always\nexaggerates everything. M. Grandguillot a fugitive; M. Grandguillot a\nthief; that was monstrous, impossible! A man of such probity, a house\nliked and respected by all Plassans for more than a century past. Why\npeople thought money safer there than in the Bank of France.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cConsider, Martine, this would not have come all of a sudden, like a\nthunderclap; there would have been some rumors of it beforehand. The\ndeuce! an old reputation does not fall to pieces in that way, in a\nnight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this she made a gesture of despair.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, monsieur, that is what most afflicts me, because, you see, it\nthrows some of the responsibility on me. For weeks past I have been\nhearing stories on all sides. As for you two, naturally you hear\nnothing; you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know whether you are alive or dead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNeither Pascal nor Clotilde could refrain from smiling; for it was\nindeed true that their love lifted them so far above the earth that none\nof the common sounds of existence reached them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the stories I heard were so ugly that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like to worry you\nwith them. I thought they were lies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was silent for a moment, and then added that while some people\nmerely accused M. Grandguillot of having speculated on the Bourse, there\nwere others who accused him of still worse practises. And she burst into\nfresh sobs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy God! My God! what is going to become of us? We are all going to die\nof starvation!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShaken, then, moved by seeing Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes, too, filled with tears,\nPascal made an effort to remember, to see clearly into the past. Years\nago, when he had been practising in Plassans, he had deposited at\ndifferent times, with M. Grandguillot, the twenty thousand francs on the\ninterest of which he had lived comfortably for the past sixteen years,\nand on each occasion the notary had given him a receipt for the sum\ndeposited. This would no doubt enable him to establish his position as\na personal creditor. Then a vague recollection awoke in his memory; he\nremembered, without being able to fix the date, that at the request of\nthe notary, and in consequence of certain representations made by him,\nwhich Pascal had forgotten, he had given the lawyer a power of attorney\nfor the purpose of investing the whole or a part of his money, in\nmortgages, and he was even certain that in this power the name of the\nattorney had been left in blank. But he was ignorant as to whether this\ndocument had ever been used or not; he had never taken the trouble to\ninquire how his money had been invested. A fresh pang of miserly anguish\nmade Martine cry out:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, monsieur, you are well punished for your sin. Was that a way to\nabandon one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s money? For my part, I know almost to a sou how my account\nstands every quarter; I have every figure and every document at my\nfingers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ends.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn the midst of her distress an unconscious smile broke over her face,\nlighting it all up. Her long cherished passion had been gratified; her\nfour hundred francs wages, saved almost intact, put out at interest for\nthirty years, at last amounted to the enormous sum of twenty thousand\nfrancs. And this treasure was put away in a safe place which no one\nknew. She beamed with delight at the recollection, and she said no more.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut who says that our money is lost?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Pascal.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cM. Grandguillot had a private fortune; he has not taken away with him\nhis house and his lands, I suppose. They will look into the affair; they\nwill make an investigation. I cannot make up my mind to believe him a\ncommon thief. The only trouble is the delay: a liquidation drags on so\nlong.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe spoke in this way in order to reassure Clotilde, whose growing\nanxiety he observed. She looked at him, and she looked around her at La\nSouleiade; her only care his happiness; her most ardent desire to live\nhere always, as she had lived in the past, to love him always in this\nbeloved solitude. And he, wishing to tranquilize her, recovered his fine\nindifference; never having lived for money, he did not imagine that one\ncould suffer from the want of it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I have some money!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, at last. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat does Martine mean\nby saying that we have not a sou left, and that we are going to die of\nstarvation!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he rose gaily, and made them both follow him saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, come, I am going to show you some money. And I will give some of\nit to Martine that she may make us a good dinner this evening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nUpstairs in his room he triumphantly opened his desk before them. It\nwas in a drawer of this desk that for years past he had thrown the money\nwhich his later patients had brought him of their own accord, for he had\nnever sent them an account. Nor had he ever known the exact amount of\nhis little treasure, of the gold and bank bills mingled together in\nconfusion, from which he took the sums he required for his pocket money,\nhis experiments, his presents, and his alms. During the last few months\nhe had made frequent visits to his desk, making deep inroads into\nits contents. But he had been so accustomed to find there the sums he\nrequired, after years of economy during which he had spent scarcely\nanything, that he had come to believe his savings inexhaustible.\n\nHe gave a satisfied laugh, then, as he opened the drawer, crying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow you shall see! Now you shall see!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he was confounded, when, after searching among the heap of notes and\nbills, he succeeded in collecting only a sum of 615 francs--two notes of\n100 francs each, 400 francs in gold, and 15 francs in change. He shook\nout the papers, he felt in every corner of the drawer, crying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it cannot be! There was always money here before, there was a heap\nof money here a few days ago. It must have been all those old bills that\nmisled me. I assure you that last week I saw a great deal of money. I\nhad it in my hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe spoke with such amusing good faith, his childlike surprise was so\nsincere, that Clotilde could not keep from smiling. Ah, the poor master,\nwhat a wretched business man he was! Then, as she observed Martine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nlook of anguish, her utter despair at sight of this insignificant sum,\nwhich was now all there was for the maintenance of all three, she was\nseized with a feeling of despair; her eyes filled with tears, and she\nmurmured:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy God, it is for me that you have spent everything; if we have nothing\nnow, if we are ruined, it is I who am the cause of it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal had already forgotten the money he had taken for the presents.\nEvidently that was where it had gone. The explanation tranquilized him.\nAnd as she began to speak in her grief of returning everything to the\ndealers, he grew angry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGive back what I have given you! You would give a piece of my heart\nwith it, then! No, I would rather die of hunger, I tell you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen his confidence already restored, seeing a future of unlimited\npossibilities opening out before him, he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBesides, we are not going to die of hunger to-night, are we, Martine?\nThere is enough here to keep us for a long time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMartine shook her head. She would undertake to manage with it for\ntwo months, for two and a half, perhaps, if people had sense, but not\nlonger. Formerly the drawer was replenished; there was always some money\ncoming in; but now that monsieur had given up his patients, they had\nabsolutely no income. They must not count on any help from outside,\nthen. And she ended by saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGive me the two one-hundred-franc bills. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try and make them last\nfor a month. Then we shall see. But be very prudent; don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t touch the\nfour hundred francs in gold; lock the drawer and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t open it again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, as to that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou may make your mind easy. I\nwould rather cut off my right hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd thus it was settled. Martine was to have entire control of this\nlast purse; and they might trust to her economy, they were sure that she\nwould save the centimes. As for Clotilde, who had never had a private\npurse, she would not even feel the want of money. Pascal only would\nsuffer from no longer having his inexhaustible treasure to draw upon,\nbut he had given his promise to allow the servant to buy everything.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere! That is a good piece of work!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, relieved, as happy as\nif he had just settled some important affair which would assure them a\nliving for a long time to come.\n\nA week passed during which nothing seemed to have changed at La\nSouleiade. In the midst of their tender raptures neither Pascal nor\nClotilde thought any more of the want which was impending. And one\nmorning during the absence of the latter, who had gone with Martine to\nmarket, the doctor received a visit which filled him at first with a\nsort of terror. It was from the woman who had sold him the beautiful\ncorsage of old point d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Alencon, his first present to Clotilde. He felt\nhimself so weak against a possible temptation that he trembled. Even\nbefore the woman had uttered a word he had already begun to defend\nhimself--no, no, he neither could nor would buy anything. And with\noutstretched hands he prevented her from taking anything out of her\nlittle bag, declaring to himself that he would look at nothing. The\ndealer, however, a fat, amiable woman, smiled, certain of victory. In an\ninsinuating voice she began to tell him a long story of how a lady, whom\nshe was not at liberty to name, one of the most distinguished ladies\nin Plassans, who had suddenly met with a reverse of fortune, had been\nobliged to part with one of her jewels; and she then enlarged on the\nsplendid chance--a piece of jewelry that had cost twelve hundred francs,\nand she was willing to let it go for five hundred. She opened her bag\nslowly, in spite of the terrified and ever-louder protestations of the\ndoctor, and took from it a slender gold necklace set simply with seven\npearls in front; but the pearls were of wonderful brilliancy--flawless,\nand perfect in shape. The ornament was simple, chaste, and of exquisite\ndelicacy. And instantly he saw in fancy the necklace on Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbeautiful neck, as its natural adornment. Any other jewel would have\nbeen a useless ornament, these pearls would be the fitting symbol of her\nyouth. And he took the necklace in his trembling fingers, experiencing\na mortal anguish at the idea of returning it. He defended himself still,\nhowever; he declared that he had not five hundred francs, while the\ndealer continued, in her smooth voice, to push the advantage she had\ngained. After another quarter an hour, when she thought she had him\nsecure, she suddenly offered him the necklace for three hundred francs,\nand he yielded; his mania for giving, his desire to please his idol, to\nadorn her, conquered. When he went to the desk to take the fifteen\ngold pieces to count them out to the dealer, he felt convinced that the\nnotary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s affairs would be arranged, and that they would soon have plenty\nof money.\n\nWhen Pascal found himself once more alone, with the ornament in his\npocket, he was seized with a childish delight, and he planned his little\nsurprise, while waiting, excited and impatient, for Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s return.\nThe moment she made her appearance his heart began to beat violently.\nShe was very warm, for an August sun was blazing in the sky, and she\nlaid aside her things quickly, pleased with her walk, telling him,\nlaughing, of the good bargain Martine had made--two pigeons for eighteen\nsous. While she was speaking he pretended to notice something on her\nneck.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, what have you on your neck? Let me see.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe had the necklace in his hand, and he succeeded in putting it around\nher neck, while feigning to pass his fingers over it, to assure himself\nthat there was nothing there. But she resisted, saying gaily:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t! There is nothing on my neck. Here, what are you doing? What have\nyou in your hand that is tickling me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe caught hold of her, and drew her before the long mirror, in which she\nhad a full view of herself. On her neck the slender chain showed like a\nthread of gold, and the seven pearls, like seven milky stars, shone with\nsoft luster against her satin skin. She looked charmingly childlike.\nSuddenly she gave a delighted laugh, like the cooing of a dove swelling\nout its throat proudly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, master, master, how good you are! Do you think of nothing but me,\nthen? How happy you make me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd the joy which shone in her eyes, the joy of the woman and the lover,\nhappy to be beautiful and to be adored, recompensed him divinely for his\nfolly.\n\nShe drew back her head, radiant, and held up her mouth to him. He bent\nover and kissed her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you happy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes, master, happy, happy! Pearls are so sweet, so pure! And these\nare so becoming to me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor an instant longer she admired herself in the glass, innocently vain\nof her fair flower-like skin, under the nacre drops of the pearls. Then,\nyielding to a desire to show herself, hearing the servant moving about\noutside, she ran out, crying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMartine, Martine! See what master has just given me! Say, am I not\nbeautiful!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut all at once, seeing the old maid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s severe face, that had suddenly\nturned an ashen hue, she became confused, and all her pleasure was\nspoiled. Perhaps she had a consciousness of the jealous pang which\nher brilliant youth caused this poor creature, worn out in the dumb\nresignation of her servitude, in adoration of her master. This, however,\nwas only a momentary feeling, unconscious in the one, hardly suspected\nby the other, and what remained was the evident disapprobation of the\neconomical servant, condemning the present with her sidelong glance.\n\nClotilde was seized with a little chill.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she murmured, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaster has rummaged his desk again. Pearls are\nvery dear, are they not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal, embarrassed, too, protested volubly, telling them of the\nsplendid opportunity presented by the dealer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visit. An incredibly good\nstroke of business--it was impossible to avoid buying the necklace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow much?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the young girl with real anxiety.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThree hundred francs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMartine, who had not yet opened her lips, but who looked terrible in her\nsilence, could not restrain a cry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood God! enough to live upon for six weeks, and we have not bread!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLarge tears welled from Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes. She would have torn the\nnecklace from her neck if Pascal had not prevented her. She wished to\ngive it to him on the instant, and she faltered in heart-broken tones:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is true, Martine is right. Master is mad, and I am mad, too, to keep\nthis for an instant, in the situation in which we are. It would burn my\nflesh. Let me take it back, I beg of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNever would he consent to this, he said. Now his eyes, too, were moist,\nhe joined in their grief, crying that he was incorrigible, that they\nought to have taken all the money away from him. And running to the desk\nhe took the hundred francs that were left, and forced Martine to take\nthem, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell you that I will not keep another sou. I should spend this, too.\nTake it, Martine; you are the only one of us who has any sense. You will\nmake the money last, I am very certain, until our affairs are settled.\nAnd you, dear, keep that; do not grieve me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNothing more was said about this incident. But Clotilde kept the\nnecklace, wearing it under her gown; and there was a sort of delightful\nmystery in feeling on her neck, unknown to every one, this simple,\npretty ornament. Sometimes, when they were alone, she would smile at\nPascal and draw the pearls from her dress quickly, and show them to him\nwithout a word; and as quickly she would replace them again on her warm\nneck, filled with delightful emotion. It was their fond folly which she\nthus recalled to him, with a confused gratitude, a vivid and radiant\njoy--a joy which nevermore left her.\n\nA straitened existence, sweet in spite of everything, now began for\nthem. Martine made an exact inventory of the resources of the house, and\nit was not reassuring. The provision of potatoes only promised to be\nof any importance. As ill luck would have it, the jar of oil was almost\nout, and the last cask of wine was also nearly empty. La Souleiade,\nhaving neither vines nor olive trees, produced only a few vegetables and\nsome fruits--pears, not yet ripe, and trellis grapes, which were to be\ntheir only delicacies. And meat and bread had to be bought every day. So\nthat from the first day the servant put Pascal and Clotilde on rations,\nsuppressing the former sweets, creams, and pastry, and reducing the food\nto the quantity barely necessary to sustain life. She resumed all\nher former authority, treating them like children who were not to be\nconsulted, even with regard to their wishes or their tastes. It was\nshe who arranged the menus, who knew better than themselves what they\nwanted; but all this like a mother, surrounding them with unceasing\ncare, performing the miracle of enabling them to live still with comfort\non their scanty resources; occasionally severe with them, for their own\ngood, as one is severe with a child when it refuses to eat its food. And\nit seemed as if this maternal care, this last immolation, the illusory\npeace with which she surrounded their love, gave her, too, a little\nhappiness, and drew her out of the dumb despair into which she had\nfallen. Since she had thus watched over them she had begun to look like\nher old self, with her little white face, the face of a nun vowed to\nchastity; her calm ash-colored eyes, which expressed the resignation of\nher thirty years of servitude. When, after the eternal potatoes and the\nlittle cutlet at four sous, undistinguishable among the vegetables, she\nwas able, on certain days, without compromising her budget, to give them\npancakes, she was triumphant, she laughed to see them laugh.\n\nPascal and Clotilde thought everything she did was right, which did not\nprevent them, however, from jesting about her when she was not present.\nThe old jests about her avarice were repeated over and over again. They\nsaid that she counted the grains of pepper, so many grains for each\ndish, in her passion for economy. When the potatoes had too little oil,\nwhen the cutlets were reduced to a mouthful, they would exchange a quick\nglance, stifling their laughter in their napkins, until she had left\nthe room. Everything was a source of amusement to them, and they laughed\ninnocently at their misery.\n\nAt the end of the first month Pascal thought of Martine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wages. Usually\nshe took her forty francs herself from the common purse which she kept.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy poor girl,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to her one evening, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat are you going to do\nfor your wages, now that we have no more money?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe remained for a moment with her eyes fixed on the ground, with an air\nof consternation, then she said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, monsieur, I must only wait.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut he saw that she had not said all that was in her mind, that she had\nthought of some arrangement which she did not know how to propose to\nhim, so he encouraged her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then, if monsieur would consent to it, I should like monsieur to\nsign me a paper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow, a paper?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, a paper, in which monsieur should say, every month, that he owes\nme forty francs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal at once made out the paper for her, and this made her quite\nhappy. She put it away as carefully as if it had been real money.\nThis evidently tranquilized her. But the paper became a new subject of\nwondering amusement to the doctor and his companion. In what did the\nextraordinary power consist which money has on certain natures? This\nold maid, who would serve him on bended knees, who adored him above\neverything, to the extent of having devoted to him her whole life, to\nask for this silly guarantee, this scrap of paper which was of no value,\nif he should be unable to pay her.\n\nSo far neither Pascal nor Clotilde had any great merit in preserving\ntheir serenity in misfortune, for they did not feel it. They lived high\nabove it, in the rich and happy realm of their love. At table they did\nnot know what they were eating; they might fancy they were partaking of\na princely banquet, served on silver dishes. They were unconscious of\nthe increasing destitution around them, of the hunger of the servant\nwho lived upon the crumbs from their table; and they walked through the\nempty house as through a palace hung with silk and filled with riches.\nThis was undoubtedly the happiest period of their love. The workroom had\npleasant memories of the past, and they spent whole days there, wrapped\nluxuriously in the joy of having lived so long in it together. Then, out\nof doors, in every corner of La Souleiade, royal summer had set up his\nblue tent, dazzling with gold. In the morning, in the embalsamed walks\non the pine grove; at noon under the dark shadow of the plane trees,\nlulled by the murmur of the fountain; in the evening on the cool\nterrace, or in the still warm threshing yard bathed in the faint blue\nradiance of the first stars, they lived with rapture their straitened\nlife, their only ambition to live always together, indifferent to all\nelse. The earth was theirs, with all its riches, its pomps, and its\ndominions, since they loved each other.\n\nToward the end of August however, matters grew bad again. At times they\nhad rude awakenings, in the midst of this life without ties, without\nduties, without work; this life which was so sweet, but which it would\nbe impossible, hurtful, they knew, to lead always. One evening Martine\ntold them that she had only fifty francs left, and that they would have\ndifficulty in managing for two weeks longer, even giving up wine. In\naddition to this the news was very serious; the notary Grandguillot was\nbeyond a doubt insolvent, so that not even the personal creditors would\nreceive anything. In the beginning they had relied on the house and the\ntwo farms which the fugitive notary had left perforce behind him, but it\nwas now certain that this property was in his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name and, while\nhe was enjoying in Switzerland, as it was said, the beauty of the\nmountains, she lived on one of the farms, which she cultivated\nquietly, away from the annoyances of the liquidation. In short, it was\ninfamous--a hundred families ruined; left without bread. An assignee had\nindeed been appointed, but he had served only to confirm the disaster,\nsince not a centime of assets had been discovered. And Pascal, with his\nusual indifference, neglected even to go and see him to speak to him\nabout his own case, thinking that he already knew all that there was\nto be known about it, and that it was useless to stir up this ugly\nbusiness, since there was neither honor nor profit to be derived from\nit.\n\nThen, indeed, the future looked threatening at La Souleiade. Black want\nstared them in the face. And Clotilde, who, in reality, had a great\ndeal of good sense, was the first to take alarm. She maintained her\ncheerfulness while Pascal was present, but, more prescient than he, in\nher womanly tenderness, she fell into a state of absolute terror if he\nleft her for an instant, asking herself what was to become of him at\nhis age with so heavy a burden upon his shoulders. For several days she\ncherished in secret a project--to work and earn money, a great deal of\nmoney, with her pastels. People had so often praised her extraordinary\nand original talent that, taking Martine into her confidence, she sent\nher one fine morning to offer some of her fantastic bouquets to the\ncolor dealer of the Cours Sauvaire, who was a relation, it was said, of\na Parisian artist. It was with the express condition that nothing was to\nbe exhibited in Plassans, that everything was to be sent to a distance.\nBut the result was disastrous; the merchant was frightened by the\nstrangeness of the design, and by the fantastic boldness of the\nexecution, and he declared that they would never sell. This threw her\ninto despair; great tears welled her eyes. Of what use was she? It was\na grief and a humiliation to be good for nothing. And the servant was\nobliged to console her, saying that no doubt all women were not born for\nwork; that some grew like the flowers in the gardens, for the sake\nof their fragrance; while others were the wheat of the fields that is\nground up and used for food.\n\nMartine, meantime, cherished another project; it was to urge the doctor\nto resume his practise. At last she mentioned it to Clotilde, who at\nonce pointed out to her the difficulty, the impossibility almost, of\nsuch an attempt. She and Pascal had been talking about his doing so only\nthe day before. He, too, was anxious, and had thought of work as the\nonly chance of salvation. The idea of opening an office again was\nnaturally the first that had presented itself to him. But he had been\nfor so long a time the physician of the poor! How could he venture now\nto ask payment when it was so many years since he had left off doing so?\nBesides, was it not too late, at his age, to recommence a career? not to\nspeak of the absurd rumors that had been circulating about him, the name\nwhich they had given him of a crack-brained genius. He would not find a\nsingle patient now, it would be a useless cruelty to force him to make\nan attempt which would assuredly result only in a lacerated heart and\nempty hands. Clotilde, on the contrary, had used all her influence to\nturn him from the idea. Martine comprehended the reasonableness of these\nobjections, and she too declared that he must be prevented from running\nthe risk of so great a chagrin. But while she was speaking a new idea\noccurred to her, as she suddenly remembered an old register, which she\nhad met with in a press, and in which she had in former times entered\nthe doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visits. For a long time it was she who had kept the\naccounts. There were so many patients who had never paid that a list\nof them filled three of the large pages of the register. Why, then, now\nthat they had fallen into misfortune, should they not ask from these\npeople the money which they justly owed? It might be done without saying\nanything to monsieur, who had never been willing to appeal to the\nlaw. And this time Clotilde approved of her idea. It was a perfect\nconspiracy. Clotilde consulted the register, and made out the bills, and\nthe servant presented them. But nowhere did she receive a sou; they told\nher at every door that they would look over the account; that they would\nstop in and see the doctor himself. Ten days passed, no one came, and\nthere were now only six francs in the house, barely enough to live upon\nfor two or three days longer.\n\nMartine, when she returned with empty hands on the following day from a\nnew application to an old patient, took Clotilde aside and told her that\nshe had just been talking with Mme. Felicite at the corner of the Rue de\nla Banne. The latter had undoubtedly been watching for her. She had\nnot again set foot in La Souleiade. Not even the misfortune which had\nbefallen her son--the sudden loss of his money, of which the whole\ntown was talking--had brought her to him; she still continued stern and\nindignant. But she waited in trembling excitement, she maintained her\nattitude as an offended mother only in the certainty that she would at\nlast have Pascal at her feet, shrewdly calculating that he would sooner\nor later be compelled to appeal to her for assistance. When he had not a\nsou left, when he knocked at her door, then she would dictate her\nterms; he should marry Clotilde, or, better still, she would demand the\ndeparture of the latter. But the days passed, and he did not come. And\nthis was why she had stopped Martine, assuming a pitying air, asking\nwhat news there was, and seeming to be surprised that they had not had\nrecourse to her purse, while giving it to be understood that her dignity\nforbade her to take the first step.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou should speak to monsieur, and persuade him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d ended the servant. And\nindeed, why should he not appeal to his mother? That would be entirely\nnatural.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! never would I undertake such a commission,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Clotilde.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster would be angry, and with reason. I truly believe he would die of\nstarvation before he would eat grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bread.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut on the evening of the second day after this, at dinner, as Martine\nwas putting on the table a piece of boiled beef left over from the day\nbefore, she gave them notice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no more money, monsieur, and to-morrow there will be only\npotatoes, without oil or butter. It is three weeks now that you have had\nonly water to drink; now you will have to do without meat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey were still cheerful, they could still jest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you salt, my good girl?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, that; yes, monsieur, there is still a little left.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, potatoes and salt are very good when one is hungry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat night, however, Pascal noticed that Clotilde was feverish; this was\nthe hour in which they exchanged confidences, and she ventured to tell\nhim of her anxiety on his account, on her own, on that of the whole\nhouse. What was going to become of them when all their resources should\nbe exhausted? For a moment she thought of speaking to him of his mother.\nBut she was afraid, and she contented herself with confessing to him\nwhat she and Martine had done--the old register examined, the bills made\nout and sent, the money asked everywhere in vain. In other circumstances\nhe would have been greatly annoyed and very angry at this confession;\noffended that they should have acted without his knowledge, and contrary\nto the attitude he had maintained during his whole professional life. He\nremained for a long tine silent, strongly agitated, and this would have\nsufficed to prove how great must be his secret anguish at times, under\nhis apparent indifference to poverty. Then he forgave Clotilde, clasping\nher wildly to his breast, and finally he said that she had done right,\nthat they could not continue to live much longer as they were living,\nin a destitution which increased every day. Then they fell into silence,\neach trying to think of a means of procuring the money necessary for\ntheir daily wants, each suffering keenly; she, desperate at the thought\nof the tortures that awaited him; he unable to accustom himself to the\nidea of seeing her wanting bread. Was their happiness forever ended,\nthen? Was poverty going to blight their spring with its chill breath?\n\nAt breakfast, on the following day, they ate only fruit. The doctor was\nvery silent during the morning, a prey to a visible struggle. And it was\nnot until three o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock that he took a resolution.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, we must stir ourselves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to his companion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not\nwish you to fast this evening again; so put on your hat, we will go out\ntogether.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe looked at him, waiting for an explanation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, since they owe us money, and have refused to give it to you, I\nwill see whether they will also refuse to give it to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis hands trembled; the thought of demanding payment in this way, after\nso many years, evidently made him suffer terribly; but he forced\na smile, he affected to be very brave. And she, who knew from the\ntrembling of his voice the extent of his sacrifice, had tears in her\neyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, master; don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go if it makes you suffer so much. Martine can go\nagain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the servant, who was present, approved highly of monsieur\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nintention.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd why should not monsieur go? There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no shame in asking what is owed\nto one, is there? Every one should have his own; for my part, I think it\nquite right that monsieur should show at last that he is a man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, as before, in their hours of happiness, old King David, as Pascal\njestingly called himself, left the house, leaning on Abishag\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm.\nNeither of them was yet in rags; he still wore his tightly buttoned\novercoat; she had on her pretty linen gown with red spots, but doubtless\nthe consciousness of their poverty lowered them in their own estimation,\nmaking them feel that they were now only two poor people who occupied\na very insignificant place in the world, for they walked along by the\nhouses, shunning observation. The sunny streets were almost deserted. A\nfew curious glances embarrassed them. They did not hasten their steps,\nhowever; only their hearts were oppressed at the thought of the visits\nthey were about to make.\n\nPascal resolved to begin with an old magistrate whom he had treated\nfor an affection of the liver. He entered the house, leaving Clotilde\nsitting on the bench in the Cours Sauvaire. But he was greatly relieved\nwhen the magistrate, anticipating his demand, told him that he did not\nreceive his rents until October, and that he would pay him then. At\nthe house of an old lady of seventy, a paralytic, the rebuff was of a\ndifferent kind. She was offended because her account had been sent to\nher through a servant who had been impolite; so that he hastened to\noffer her his excuses, giving her all the time she desired. Then he\nclimbed up three flights of stairs to the apartment of a clerk in the\ntax collector\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office, whom he found still ill, and so poor that he did\nnot even venture to make his demand. Then followed a mercer, a lawyer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwife, an oil merchant, a baker--all well-to-do people; and all turned\nhim away, some with excuses, others by denying him admittance; a few\neven pretended not to know what he meant. There remained the Marquise\nde Valqueyras, the sole representative of a very ancient family, a widow\nwith a girl of ten, who was very rich, and whose avarice was notorious.\nHe had left her for the last, for he was greatly afraid of her. Finally\nhe knocked at the door of her ancient mansion, at the foot of the Cours\nSauvaire, a massive structure of the time of Mazarin. He remained so\nlong in the house that Clotilde, who was walking under the trees, at\nlast became uneasy.\n\nWhen he finally made his appearance, at the end of a full half hour, she\nsaid jestingly, greatly relieved:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, what was the matter? Had she no money?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut here, too, he had been unsuccessful; she complained that her tenants\ndid not pay her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cImagine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, in explanation of his long absence, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe little\ngirl is ill. I am afraid that it is the beginning of a gastric fever. So\nshe wished me to see the child, and I examined her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA smile which she could not suppress came to Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lips.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you prescribed for her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course; could I do otherwise?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe took his arm again, deeply affected, and he felt her press it\nagainst her heart. For a time they walked on aimlessly. It was all over;\nthey had knocked at every debtor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door, and nothing now remained for\nthem to do but to return home with empty hands. But this Pascal refused\nto do, determined that Clotilde should have something more than the\npotatoes and water which awaited them. When they ascended the Cours\nSauvaire, they turned to the left, to the new town; drifting now whither\ncruel fate led them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Pascal at last; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have an idea. If I were to speak to\nRamond he would willingly lend us a thousand francs, which we could\nreturn to him when our affairs are arranged.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did not answer at once. Ramond, whom she had rejected, who was now\nmarried and settled in a house in the new town, in a fair way to become\nthe fashionable physician of the place, and to make a fortune! She knew,\nindeed, that he had a magnanimous soul and a kind heart. If he had not\nvisited them again it had been undoubtedly through delicacy. Whenever\nthey chanced to meet, he saluted them with so admiring an air, he seemed\nso pleased to see their happiness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWould that be disagreeable to you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Pascal ingenuously. For his\npart, he would have thrown open to the young physician his house, his\npurse, and his heart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered quickly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere has never been anything between\nus but affection and frankness. I think I gave him a great deal of pain,\nbut he has forgiven me. You are right; we have no other friend. It is to\nRamond that we must apply.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIll luck pursued them, however. Ramond was absent from home, attending a\nconsultation at Marseilles, and he would not be back until the following\nevening. And it young Mme. Ramond, an old friend of Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s,\nsome three years her junior, who received them. She seemed a little\nembarrassed, but she was very amiable, notwithstanding. But the doctor,\nnaturally, did not prefer his request, and contented himself with\nsaying, in explanation of his visit, that he had missed Ramond. When\nthey were in the street again, Pascal and Clotilde felt themselves once\nmore abandoned and alone. Where now should they turn? What new effort\nshould they make? And they walked on again aimlessly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did not tell you, master,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Clotilde at last ventured to murmur, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut\nit seems that Martine met grandmother the other day. Yes, grandmother\nhas been uneasy about us. She asked Martine why we did not go to her, if\nwe were in want. And see, here is her house.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey were in fact, in the Rue de la Banne. They could see the corner of\nthe Place de la Sous-Prefecture. But he at once silenced her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever, do you hear! Nor shall you go either. You say that because it\ngrieves you to see me in this poverty. My heart, too, is heavy, to think\nthat you also are in want, that you also suffer. But it is better to\nsuffer than to do a thing that would leave one an eternal remorse. I\nwill not. I cannot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey emerged from the Rue de la Banne, and entered the old quarter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would a thousand times rather apply to a stranger. Perhaps we still\nhave friends, even if they are only among the poor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd resolved to beg, David continued his walk, leaning on the arm of\nAbishag; the old mendicant king went from door to door, leaning on the\nshoulder of the loving subject whose youth was now his only support.\nIt was almost six o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock; the heat had abated; the narrow streets were\nfilling with people; and in this populous quarter where they were loved,\nthey were everywhere greeted with smiles. Something of pity was mingled\nwith the admiration they awakened, for every one knew of their ruin. But\nthey seemed of a nobler beauty than before, he all white, she all blond,\npressing close to each other in their misfortune. They seemed more\nunited, more one with each other than ever; holding their heads erect,\nproud of their glorious love, though touched by misfortune; he shaken,\nwhile she, with a courageous heart, sustained him. And in spite of the\npoverty that had so suddenly overtaken them they walked without shame,\nvery poor and very great, with the sorrowful smile under which they\nconcealed the desolation of their souls. Workmen in dirty blouses passed\nthem by, who had more money in their pockets than they. No one ventured\nto offer them the sou which is not refused to those who are hungry. At\nthe Rue Canoquin they stopped at the house of Gulraude. She had died\nthe week before. Two other attempts which they made failed. They were\nreduced now to consider where they could borrow ten francs. They had\nbeen walking about the town for three hours, but they could not resolve\nto go home empty-handed.\n\nAh, this Plassans, with its Cours Sauvaire, its Rue de Rome, and its Rue\nde la Banne, dividing it into three quarters; this Plassans; with its\nwindows always closed, this sun-baked town, dead in appearance, but\nwhich concealed under this sleeping surface a whole nocturnal life of\nthe clubhouse and the gaming table. They walked through it three times\nmore with slackened pace, on this clear, calm close of a glowing August\nday. In the yard of the coach office a few old stage-coaches, which\nstill plied between the town and the mountain villages, were standing\nunharnessed; and under the thick shade of the plane trees at the doors\nof the cafes, the customers, who were to be seen from seven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock\nin the morning, looked after them smiling. In the new town, too, the\nservants came and stood at the doors of the wealthy houses; they met\nwith less sympathy here than in the deserted streets of the Quartier St.\nMarc, whose antique houses maintained a friendly silence. They returned\nto the heart of the old quarter where they were most liked; they went as\nfar as St. Saturnin, the cathedral, whose apse was shaded by the garden\nof the chapter, a sweet and peaceful solitude, from which a beggar drove\nthem by himself asking an alms from them. They were building rapidly in\nthe neighborhood of the railway station; a new quarter was growing up\nthere, and they bent their steps in that direction. Then they returned a\nlast time to the Place de la Sous-Prefecture, with a sudden reawakening\nof hope, thinking that they might meet some one who would offer them\nmoney. But they were followed only by the indulgent smile of the town,\nat seeing them so united and so beautiful. Only one woman had tears in\nher eyes, foreseeing, perhaps, the sufferings that awaited them. The\nstones of the Viorne, the little sharp paving stones, wounded their\nfeet. And they had at last to return to La Souleiade, without having\nsucceeded in obtaining anything, the old mendicant king and his\nsubmissive subject; Abishag, in the flower of her youth, leading back\nDavid, old and despoiled of his wealth, and weary from having walked the\nstreets in vain.\n\nIt was eight o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, and Martine, who was waiting for them,\ncomprehended that she would have no cooking to do this evening. She\npretended that she had dined, and as she looked ill Pascal sent her at\nonce to bed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe do not need you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Clotilde. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs the potatoes are on the fire we\ncan take them up very well ourselves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe servant, who was feverish and out of humor, yielded. She muttered\nsome indistinct words--when people had eaten up everything what was the\nuse of sitting down to table? Then, before shutting herself into her\nroom, she added:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMonsieur, there is no more hay for Bonhomme. I thought he was looking\nbadly a little while ago; monsieur ought to go and see him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal and Clotilde, filled with uneasiness, went to the stable. The old\nhorse was, in fact, lying on the straw in the somnolence of expiring old\nage. They had not taken him out for six months past, for his legs, stiff\nwith rheumatism, refused to support him, and he had become completely\nblind. No one could understand why the doctor kept the old beast.\nEven Martine had at last said that he ought to be slaughtered, if only\nthrough pity. But Pascal and Clotilde cried out at this, as much excited\nas if it had been proposed to them to put an end to some aged relative\nwho was not dying fast enough. No, no, he had served them for more than\na quarter of a century; he should die comfortably with them, like the\nworthy fellow he had always been. And to-night the doctor did not scorn\nto examine him, as if he had never attended any other patients than\nanimals. He lifted up his hoofs, looked at his gums, and listened to the\nbeating of his heart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, there is nothing the matter with him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said at last. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is\nsimply old age. Ah, my poor old fellow, I think, indeed, we shall never\nagain travel the roads together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe idea that there was no more hay distressed Clotilde. But Pascal\nreassured her--an animal of that age, that no longer moved about, needed\nso little. She stooped down and took a few handfuls of grass from a heap\nwhich the servant had left there, and both were rejoiced when Bonhomme\ndeigned, solely and simply through friendship, as it seemed, to eat the\ngrass out of her hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, laughing, \u00e2\u0080\u009cso you still have an appetite! You cannot be\nvery sick, then; you must not try to work upon our feelings. Good night,\nand sleep well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd they left him to his slumbers after having each given him, as usual,\na hearty kiss on either side of his nose.\n\nNight fell, and an idea occurred to them, in order not to remain\ndownstairs in the empty house--to close up everything and eat their\ndinner upstairs. Clotilde quickly took up the dish of potatoes, the\nsalt-cellar, and a fine decanter of water; while Pascal took charge of\na basket of grapes, the first which they had yet gathered from an early\nvine at the foot of the terrace. They closed the door, and laid the\ncloth on a little table, putting the potatoes in the middle between the\nsalt-cellar and the decanter, and the basket of grapes on a chair beside\nthem. And it was a wonderful feast, which reminded them of the delicious\nbreakfast they had made on the morning on which Martine had obstinately\nshut herself up in her room, and refused to answer them. They\nexperienced the same delight as then at being alone, at waiting upon\nthemselves, at eating from the same plate, sitting close beside each\nother. This evening, which they had anticipated with so much dread, had\nin store for them the most delightful hours of their existence. As soon\nas they found themselves at home in the large friendly room, as far\nremoved from the town which they had just been scouring as if they had\nbeen a hundred leagues away from it, all uneasiness and all sadness\nvanished--even to the recollection of the wretched afternoon wasted in\nuseless wanderings. They were once more indifferent to all that was\nnot their affection; they no longer remembered that they had lost their\nfortune; that they might have to hunt up a friend on the morrow in order\nto be able to dine in the evening. Why torture themselves with fears\nof coming want, when all they required to enjoy the greatest possible\nhappiness was to be together?\n\nBut Pascal felt a sudden terror.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy God! and we dreaded this evening so greatly! Is it wise to be happy\nin this way? Who knows what to-morrow may have in store for us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut she put her little hand over his mouth; she desired that he should\nhave one more evening of perfect happiness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no; to-morrow we shall love each other as we love each other\nto-day. Love me with all your strength, as I love you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd never had they eaten with more relish. She displayed the appetite of\na healthy young girl with a good digestion; she ate the potatoes with a\nhearty appetite, laughing, thinking them delicious, better than the\nmost vaunted delicacies. He, too, recovered the appetite of his youthful\ndays. They drank with delight deep draughts of pure water. Then the\ngrapes for dessert filled them with admiration; these grapes so fresh,\nthis blood of the earth which the sun had touched with gold. They ate\nto excess; they became drunk on water and fruit, and more than all on\ngaiety. They did not remember ever before to have enjoyed such a feast\ntogether; even the famous breakfast they had made, with its luxuries of\ncutlets and bread and wine, had not given them this intoxication, this\njoy in living, when to be together was happiness enough, changing the\nchina to dishes of gold, and the miserable food to celestial fare such\nas not even the gods enjoyed.\n\nIt was now quite dark, but they did not light the lamp. Through the\nwide open windows they could see the vast summer sky. The night breeze\nentered, still warm and laden with a faint odor of lavender. The moon\nhad just risen above the horizon, large and round, flooding the room\nwith a silvery light, in which they saw each other as in a dream light\ninfinitely bright and sweet.\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\nBut on the following day their disquietude all returned. They were now\nobliged to go in debt. Martine obtained on credit bread, wine, and\na little meat, much to her shame, be it said, forced as she was to\nmaneuver and tell lies, for no one was ignorant of the ruin that had\novertaken the house. The doctor had indeed thought of mortgaging La\nSouleiade, but only as a last resource. All he now possessed was this\nproperty, which was worth twenty thousand francs, but for which he would\nperhaps not get fifteen thousand, if he should sell it; and when these\nshould be spent black want would be before them, the street, without\neven a stone of their own on which to lay their heads. Clotilde\ntherefore begged Pascal to wait and not to take any irrevocable step so\nlong as things were not utterly desperate.\n\nThree or four days passed. It was the beginning of September, and\nthe weather unfortunately changed; terrible storms ravaged the entire\ncountry; a part of the garden wall was blown down, and as Pascal was\nunable to rebuild it, the yawning breach remained. Already they were\nbeginning to be rude at the baker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. And one morning the old servant\ncame home with the meat from the butcher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in tears, saying that he had\ngiven her the refuse. A few days more and they would be unable to obtain\nanything on credit. It had become absolutely necessary to consider how\nthey should find the money for their small daily expenses.\n\nOne Monday morning, the beginning of another week of torture, Clotilde\nwas very restless. A struggle seemed to be going on within her, and it\nwas only when she saw Pascal refuse at breakfast his share of a piece of\nbeef which had been left over from the day before that she at last came\nto a decision. Then with a calm and resolute air, she went out after\nbreakfast with Martine, after quietly putting into the basket of the\nlatter a little package--some articles of dress which she was giving\nher, she said.\n\nWhen she returned two hours later she was very pale. But her large eyes,\nso clear and frank, were shining. She went up to the doctor at once and\nmade her confession.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must ask your forgiveness, master, for I have just been disobeying\nyou, and I know that I am going to pain you greatly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, what have you been doing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked uneasily, not understanding\nwhat she meant.\n\nSlowly, without removing her eyes from him, she drew from her pocket\nan envelope, from which she took some bank-notes. A sudden intuition\nenlightened him, and he cried:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, my God! the jewels, the presents I gave you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he, who was usually so good-tempered and gentle, was convulsed with\ngrief and anger. He seized her hands in his, crushing with almost brutal\nforce the fingers which held the notes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy God! what have you done, unhappy girl? It is my heart that you have\nsold, both our hearts, that had entered into those jewels, which\nyou have given with them for money! The jewels which I gave you, the\nsouvenirs of our divinest hours, your property, yours only, how can\nyou wish me to take them back, to turn them to my profit? Can it be\npossible--have you thought of the anguish that this would give me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you, master,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered gently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo you think that I could\nconsent to our remaining in the unhappy situation in which we are, in\nwant of everything, while I had these rings and necklaces and earrings\nlaid away in the bottom of a drawer? Why, my whole being would rise in\nprotest. I should think myself a miser, a selfish wretch, if I had\nkept them any longer. And, although it was a grief for me to part with\nthem--ah, yes, I confess it, so great a grief that I could hardly find\nthe courage to do it--I am certain that I have only done what I ought to\nhave done as an obedient and loving woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd as he still grasped her hands, tears came to her eyes, and she added\nin the same gentle voice and with a faint smile:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t press so hard; you hurt me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen repentant and deeply moved, Pascal, too, wept.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a brute to get angry in this way. You acted rightly; you could\nnot do otherwise. But forgive me; it was hard for me to see you despoil\nyourself. Give me your hands, your poor hands, and let me kiss away the\nmarks of my stupid violence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe took her hands again in his tenderly; he covered them with kisses; he\nthought them inestimably precious, so delicate and bare, thus\nstripped of their rings. Consoled now, and joyous, she told him of her\nescapade--how she had taken Martine into her confidence, and how both\nhad gone to the dealer who had sold him the corsage of point d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Alencon,\nand how after interminable examining and bargaining the woman had given\nsix thousand francs for all the jewels. Again he repressed a gesture\nof despair--six thousand francs! when the jewels had cost him more than\nthree times that amount--twenty thousand francs at the very least.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to her at last; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will take this money, since, in\nthe goodness of your heart, you have brought it to me. But it is clearly\nunderstood that it is yours. I swear to you that I will, for the future,\nbe more miserly than Martine herself. I will give her only the few sous\nthat are absolutely necessary for our maintenance, and you will find in\nthe desk all that may be left of this sum, if I should never be able to\ncomplete it and give it back to you entire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe clasped her in an embrace that still trembled with emotion.\nPresently, lowering his voice to a whisper, he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd did you sell everything, absolutely everything?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWithout speaking, she disengaged herself a little from his embrace,\nand put her fingers to her throat, with her pretty gesture, smiling and\nblushing. Finally, she drew out the slender chain on which shone the\nseven pearls, like milky stars. Then she put it back again out of sight.\n\nHe, too, blushed, and a great joy filled his heart. He embraced her\npassionately.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow good you are, and how I love you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut from this time forth the recollection of the jewels which had been\nsold rested like a weight upon his heart; and he could not look at\nthe money in his desk without pain. He was haunted by the thought\nof approaching want, inevitable want, and by a still more bitter\nthought--the thought of his age, of his sixty years which rendered him\nuseless, incapable of earning a comfortable living for a wife; he had\nbeen suddenly and rudely awakened from his illusory dream of eternal\nlove to the disquieting reality. He had fallen unexpectedly into\npoverty, and he felt himself very old--this terrified him and filled him\nwith a sort of remorse, of desperate rage against himself, as if he had\nbeen guilty of a crime. And this embittered his every hour; if through\nmomentary forgetfulness he permitted himself to indulge in a little\ngaiety his distress soon returned with greater poignancy than ever,\nbringing with it a sudden and inexplicable sadness. He did not dare to\nquestion himself, and his dissatisfaction with himself and his suffering\nincreased every day.\n\nThen a frightful revelation came to him. One morning, when he was alone,\nhe received a letter bearing the Plassans postmark, the superscription\non which he examined with surprise, not recognizing the writing. This\nletter was not signed; and after reading a few lines he made an\nangry movement as if to tear it up and throw it away; but he sat down\ntrembling instead, and read it to the end. The style was perfectly\ncourteous; the long phrases rolled on, measured and carefully worded,\nlike diplomatic phrases, whose only aim is to convince. It was\ndemonstrated to him with a superabundance of arguments that the scandal\nof La Souleiade had lasted too long already. If passion, up to a certain\npoint, explained the fault, yet a man of his age and in his situation\nwas rendering himself contemptible by persisting in wrecking the\nhappiness of the young relative whose trustfulness he abused. No one\nwas ignorant of the ascendency which he had acquired over her; it was\nadmitted that she gloried in sacrificing herself for him; but ought he\nnot, on his side, to comprehend that it was impossible that she should\nlove an old man, that what she felt was merely pity and gratitude, and\nthat it was high time to deliver her from this senile love, which would\nfinally leave her with a dishonored name! Since he could not even assure\nher a small fortune, the writer hoped he would act like an honorable\nman, and have the strength to separate from her, through consideration\nfor her happiness, if it were not yet too late. And the letter concluded\nwith the reflection that evil conduct was always punished in the end.\n\nFrom the first sentence Pascal felt that this anonymous letter came from\nhis mother. Old Mme. Rougon must have dictated it; he could hear in it\nthe very inflections of her voice. But after having begun the letter\nangry and indignant, he finished it pale and trembling, seized by the\nshiver which now passed through him continually and without apparent\ncause. The letter was right, it enlightened him cruelly regarding the\nsource of his mental distress, showing him that it was remorse for\nkeeping Clotilde with him, old and poor as he was. He got up and walked\nover to a mirror, before which he stood for a long time, his eyes\ngradually filling with tears of despair at sight of his wrinkles and his\nwhite beard. The feeling of terror which arose within him, the mortal\nchill which invaded his heart, was caused by the thought that separation\nhad become necessary, inevitable. He repelled the thought, he felt\nthat he would never have the strength for a separation, but it still\nreturned; he would never now pass a single day without being assailed by\nit, without being torn by the struggle between his love and his reason\nuntil the terrible day when he should become resigned, his strength and\nhis tears exhausted. In his present weakness, he trembled merely at the\nthought of one day having this courage. And all was indeed over, the\nirrevocable had begun; he was filled with fear for Clotilde, so young\nand so beautiful, and all there was left him now was the duty of saving\nher from himself.\n\nThen, haunted by every word, by every phrase of the letter, he tortured\nhimself at first by trying to persuade himself that she did not love\nhim, that all she felt for him was pity and gratitude. It would make the\nrupture more easy to him, he thought, if he were once convinced that she\nsacrificed herself, and that in keeping her with him longer he was only\ngratifying his monstrous selfishness. But it was in vain that he studied\nher, that he subjected her to proofs, she remained as tender and devoted\nas ever, making the dreaded decision still more difficult. Then he\npondered over all the causes that vaguely, but ceaselessly urged their\nseparation. The life which they had been leading for months past, this\nlife without ties or duties, without work of any sort, was not good. He\nthought no longer of himself, he considered himself good for nothing now\nbut to go away and bury himself out of sight in some remote corner; but\nfor her was it not an injurious life, a life which would deteriorate\nher character and weaken her will? And suddenly he saw himself in fancy\ndying, leaving her alone to perish of hunger in the streets. No, no!\nthis would be a crime; he could not, for the sake of the happiness\nof his few remaining days, bequeath to her this heritage of shame and\nmisery.\n\nOne morning Clotilde went for a walk in the neighborhood, from which she\nreturned greatly agitated, pale and trembling, and as soon as she\nwas upstairs in the workroom, she almost fainted in Pascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms,\nfaltering:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, my God! oh, my God! those women!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTerrified, he pressed her with questions.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, tell me! What has happened?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA flush mounted to her face. She flung her arms around his neck and hid\nher head on his shoulder.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was those women! Reaching a shady spot, I was closing my parasol,\nand I had the misfortune to throw down a child. And they all rose\nagainst me, crying out such things, oh, such things--things that I\ncannot repeat, that I could not understand!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe burst into sobs. He was livid; he could find nothing to say to her;\nhe kissed her wildly, weeping like herself. He pictured to himself\nthe whole scene; he saw her pursued, hooted at, reviled. Presently he\nfaltered:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is my fault, it is through me you suffer. Listen, we will go away\nfrom here, far, far away, where we shall not be known, where you will be\nhonored, where you will be happy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut seeing him weep, she recovered her calmness by a violent effort. And\ndrying her tears, she said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! I have behaved like a coward in telling you all this. After\npromising myself that I would say nothing of it to you. But when I found\nmyself at home again, my anguish was so great that it all came out. But\nyou see now it is all over, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t grieve about it. I love you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe smiled, and putting her arms about him she kissed him in her turn,\ntrying to soothe his despair.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI love you. I love you so dearly that it will console me for\neverything. There is only you in the world, what matters anything that\nis not you? You are so good; you make me so happy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut he continued to weep, and she, too, began to weep again, and there\nwas a moment of infinite sadness, of anguish, in which they mingled\ntheir kisses and their tears.\n\nPascal, when she left him alone for an instant, thought himself a\nwretch. He could no longer be the cause of misfortune to this child,\nwhom he adored. And on the evening of the same day an event took place\nwhich brought about the solution hitherto sought in vain, with the fear\nof finding it. After dinner Martine beckoned him aside, and gave him a\nletter, with all sorts of precautions, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI met Mme. Felicite, and she charged me to give you this letter,\nmonsieur, and she told me to tell you that she would have brought it\nto you herself, only that regard for her reputation prevented her\nfrom returning here. She begs you to send her back M. Maxime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter,\nletting her know mademoiselle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s answer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was, in fact, a letter from Maxime, and Mme. Felicite, glad to have\nreceived it, used it as a new means of conquering her son, after having\nwaited in vain for misery to deliver him up to her, repentant and\nimploring. As neither Pascal nor Clotilde had come to demand aid or\nsuccor from her, she had once more changed her plan, returning to her\nold idea of separating them; and, this time, the opportunity seemed\nto her decisive. Maxime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter was a pressing one; he urged his\ngrandmother to plead his cause with his sister. Ataxia had declared\nitself; he was able to walk now only leaning on his servant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm. His\nsolitude terrified him, and he urgently entreated his sister to come to\nhim. He wished to have her with him as a rampart against his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nabominable designs; as a sweet and upright woman after all, who would\ntake care of him. The letter gave it to be understood that if she\nconducted herself well toward him she would have no reason to repent it;\nand ended by reminding the young girl of the promise she had made him,\nat the time of his visit to Plassans, to come to him, if the day ever\narrived when he really needed her.\n\nPascal turned cold. He read the four pages over again. Here an\nopportunity to separate presented itself, acceptable to him and\nadvantageous for Clotilde, so easy and so natural that they ought to\naccept it at once; yet, in spite of all his reasoning he felt so weak,\nso irresolute still that his limbs trembled under him, and he was\nobliged to sit down for a moment. But he wished to be heroic, and\ncontrolling himself, he called to his companion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cread this letter which your grandmother has sent me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde read the letter attentively to the end without a word, without\na sign. Then she said simply:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, you are going to answer it, are you not? I refuse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was obliged to exercise a strong effort of self-control to avoid\nuttering a great cry of joy, as he pressed her to his heart. As if it\nwere another person who spoke, he heard himself saying quietly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou refuse--impossible! You must reflect. Let us wait till to-morrow to\ngive an answer; and let us talk it over, shall we?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSurprised, she cried excitedly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPart from each other! and why? And would you really consent to it? What\nfolly! we love each other, and you would have me leave you and go away\nwhere no one cares for me! How could you think of such a thing? It would\nbe stupid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe avoided touching on this side of the question, and hastened to speak\nof promises made--of duty.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRemember, my dear, how greatly affected you were when I told you that\nMaxime was in danger. And think of him now, struck down by disease,\nhelpless and alone, calling you to his side. Can you abandon him in that\nsituation? You have a duty to fulfil toward him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA duty?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave I any duties toward a brother who has never\noccupied himself with me? My only duty is where my heart is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you have promised. I have promised for you. I have said that you\nwere rational, and you are not going to belie my words.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRational? It is you who are not rational. It is not rational to\nseparate when to do so would make us both die of grief.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd with an angry gesture she closed the discussion, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBesides, what is the use of talking about it? There is nothing simpler;\nit is only necessary to say a single word. Answer me. Are you tired of\nme? Do you wish to send me away?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe uttered a cry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSend you away! I! Great God!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen it is all settled. If you do not send me away I shall remain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe laughed now, and, running to her desk, wrote in red pencil across\nher brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter two words--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI refuse;\u00e2\u0080\u009d then she called Martine and\ninsisted upon her taking the letter back at once. Pascal was radiant;\na wave of happiness so intense inundated his being that he let her have\nher way. The joy of keeping her with him deprived him even of his power\nof reasoning.\n\nBut that very night, what remorse did he not feel for having been so\ncowardly! He had again yielded to his longing for happiness. A deathlike\nsweat broke out upon him when he saw her in imagination far away;\nhimself alone, without her, without that caressing and subtle essence\nthat pervaded the atmosphere when she was near; her breath, her\nbrightness, her courageous rectitude, and the dear presence, physical\nand mental, which had now become as necessary to his life as the light\nof day itself. She must leave him, and he must find the strength to\ndie of it. He despised himself for his want of courage, he judged the\nsituation with terrible clear-sightedness. All was ended. An honorable\nexistence and a fortune awaited her with her brother; he could not carry\nhis senile selfishness so far as to keep her any longer in the misery in\nwhich he was, to be scorned and despised. And fainting at the thought of\nall he was losing, he swore to himself that he would be strong, that he\nwould not accept the sacrifice of this child, that he would restore her\nto happiness and to life, in her own despite.\n\nAnd now the struggle of self-abnegation began. Some days passed; he\nhad demonstrated to her so clearly the rudeness of her \u00e2\u0080\u009cI refuse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d on\nMaxime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter, that she had written a long letter to her grandmother,\nexplaining to her the reasons for her refusal. But still she would not\nleave La Souleiade. As Pascal had grown extremely parsimonious, in his\ndesire to trench as little as possible on the money obtained by the sale\nof the jewels, she surpassed herself, eating her dry bread with merry\nlaughter. One morning he surprised her giving lessons of economy to\nMartine. Twenty times a day she would look at him intently and then\nthrow herself on his neck and cover his face with kisses, to combat the\ndreadful idea of a separation, which she saw always in his eyes. Then\nshe had another argument. One evening after dinner he was seized with a\npalpitation of the heart, and almost fainted. This surprised him; he had\nnever suffered from the heart, and he believed it to be simply a return\nof his old nervous trouble. Since his great happiness he had felt less\nstrong, with an odd sensation, as if some delicate hidden spring had\nsnapped within him. Greatly alarmed, she hurried to his assistance.\nWell! now he would no doubt never speak again of her going away. When\none loved people, and they were ill, one stayed with them to take care\nof them.\n\nThe struggle thus became a daily, an hourly one. It was a continual\nassault made by affection, by devotion, by self-abnegation, in the one\ndesire for another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happiness. But while her kindness and tenderness\nmade the thought of her departure only the more cruel for Pascal,\nhe felt every day more and more strongly the necessity for it. His\nresolution was now taken. But he remained at bay, trembling and\nhesitating as to the means of persuading her. He pictured to himself her\ndespair, her tears; what should he do? how should he tell her? how could\nthey bring themselves to give each other a last embrace, never to see\neach other again? And the days passed, and he could think of nothing,\nand he began once more to accuse himself of cowardice.\n\nSometimes she would say jestingly, with a touch of affectionate malice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster, you are too kind-hearted not to keep me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut this vexed him; he grew excited, and with gloomy despair answered:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no! don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk of my kindness. If I were really kind you would have\nbeen long ago with your brother, leading an easy and honorable life,\nwith a bright and tranquil future before you, instead of obstinately\nremaining here, despised, poor, and without any prospect, to be the sad\ncompanion of an old fool like me! No, I am nothing but a coward and a\ndishonorable man!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe hastily stopped him. And it was in truth his kindness of heart,\nabove all, that bled, that immense kindness of heart which sprang from\nhis love of life, which he diffused over persons and things, in his\ncontinual care for the happiness of every one and everything. To be\nkind, was not this to love her, to make her happy, at the price of his\nown happiness? This was the kindness which it was necessary for him to\nexercise, and which he felt that he would one day exercise, heroic and\ndecisive. But like the wretch who has resolved upon suicide, he waited\nfor the opportunity, the hour, and the means, to carry out his design.\nEarly one morning, on going into the workroom, Clotilde was surprised\nto see Dr. Pascal seated at his table. It was many weeks since he had\neither opened a book or touched a pen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy! you are working?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\nWithout raising his head he answered absently:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes; this is the genealogical tree that I had not even brought up to\ndate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe stood behind him for a few moments, looking at him writing. He was\ncompleting the notices of Aunt Dide, of Uncle Macquart, and of little\nCharles, writing the dates of their death. Then, as he did not stir,\nseeming not to know that she was there, waiting for the kisses and the\nsmiles of other mornings, she walked idly over to the window and back\nagain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you are in earnest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are really working?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly; you see I ought to have noted down these deaths last month.\nAnd I have a heap of work waiting there for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe looked at him fixedly, with that steady inquiring gaze with which\nshe sought to read his thoughts.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, let us work. If you have papers to examine, or notes to\ncopy, give them to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd from this day forth he affected to give himself up entirely to work.\nBesides, it was one of his theories that absolute rest was unprofitable,\nthat it should never be prescribed, even to the overworked. As the fish\nlives in the water, so a man lives only in the external medium which\nsurrounds him, the sensations which he receives from it transforming\nthemselves in him into impulses, thoughts, and acts; so that if there\nwere absolute rest, if he continued to receive sensations without giving\nthem out again, digested and transformed, an engorgement would result, a\n_malaise_, an inevitable loss of equilibrium. For himself he had always\nfound work to be the best regulator of his existence. Even on the\nmornings when he felt ill, if he set to work he recovered his equipoise.\nHe never felt better than when he was engaged on some long work,\nmethodically planned out beforehand, so many pages to so many hours\nevery morning, and he compared this work to a balancing-pole, which\nenabled him to maintain his equilibrium in the midst of daily miseries,\nweaknesses, and mistakes. So that he attributed entirely to the idleness\nin which he had been living for some weeks past, the palpitation which\nat times made him feel as if he were going to suffocate. If he wished to\nrecover his health he had only to take up again his great work.\n\nAnd Pascal spent hours developing and explaining these theories to\nClotilde, with a feverish and exaggerated enthusiasm. He seemed to be\nonce more possessed by the love of knowledge and study in which, up\nto the time of his sudden passion for her, he had spent his life\nexclusively. He repeated to her that he could not leave his work\nunfinished, that he had still a great deal to do, if he desired to leave\na lasting monument behind him. His anxiety about the envelopes seemed\nto have taken possession of him again; he opened the large press twenty\ntimes a day, taking them down from the upper shelf and enriching them\nby new notes. His ideas on heredity were already undergoing a\ntransformation; he would have liked to review the whole, to recast the\nwhole, to deduce from the family history, natural and social, a vast\nsynthesis, a resume, in broad strokes, of all humanity. Then, besides,\nhe reviewed his method of treatment by hypodermic injections, with the\npurpose of amplifying it--a confused vision of a new therapeutics;\na vague and remote theory based on his convictions and his personal\nexperience of the beneficent dynamic influence of work.\n\nNow every morning, when he seated himself at his table, he would lament:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall not live long enough; life is too short.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe seemed to feel that he must not lose another hour. And one morning\nhe looked up abruptly and said to his companion, who was copying a\nmanuscript at his side:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen well, Clotilde. If I should die--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat an idea!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she protested, terrified.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I should die,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he resumed, \u00e2\u0080\u009clisten to me well--close all the doors\nimmediately. You are to keep the envelopes, you, you only. And when you\nhave collected all my other manuscripts, send them to Ramond. These are\nmy last wishes, do you hear?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut she refused to listen to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried hastily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou talk nonsense!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cClotilde, swear to me that you will keep the envelopes, and that you\nwill send all my other papers to Ramond.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt last, now very serious, and her eyes filled with tears, she gave\nhim the promise he desired. He caught her in his arms, he, too, deeply\nmoved, and lavished caresses upon her, as if his heart had all at once\nreopened to her. Presently he recovered his calmness, and spoke of his\nfears. Since he had been trying to work they seemed to have returned. He\nkept constant watch upon the press, pretending to have observed Martine\nprowling about it. Might they not work upon the fanaticism of this girl,\nand urge her to a bad action, persuading her that she was securing her\nmaster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eternal welfare? He had suffered so much from suspicion! In the\ndread of approaching solitude his former tortures returned--the tortures\nof the scientist, who is menaced and persecuted by his own, at his own\nfireside, in his very flesh, in the work of his brain.\n\nOne evening, when he was again discussing this subject with Clotilde, he\nsaid unthinkingly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know that when you are no longer here--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe turned very pale and, as he stopped with a start, she cried:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, master, master, you have not given up that dreadful idea, then?\nI can see in your eyes that you are hiding something from me, that you\nhave a thought which you no longer share with me. But if I go away and\nyou should die, who will be here then to protect your work?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThinking that she had become reconciled, to the idea of her departure,\nhe had the strength to answer gaily:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you suppose that I would allow myself to die without seeing you once\nmore. I will write to you, of course. You must come back to close my\neyes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNow she burst out sobbing, and sank into a chair.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy God! Can it be! You wish that to-morrow we should be together no\nlonger, we who have never been separated!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFrom this day forth Pascal seemed more engrossed than ever in his\nwork. He would sit for four or five hours at a time, whole mornings and\nafternoons, without once raising his head. He overacted his zeal.\nHe would allow no one to disturb him, by so much as a word. And when\nClotilde would leave the room on tiptoe to give an order downstairs or\nto go on some errand, he would assure himself by a furtive glance that\nshe was gone, and then let his head drop on the table, with an air\nof profound dejection. It was a painful relief from the extraordinary\neffort which he compelled himself to make when she was present; to\nremain at his table, instead of going over and taking her in his arms\nand covering her face with sweet kisses. Ah, work! how ardently he\ncalled on it as his only refuge from torturing thoughts. But for the\nmost part he was unable to work; he was obliged to feign attention,\nkeeping his eyes fixed upon the page, his sorrowful eyes that grew dim\nwith tears, while his mind, confused, distracted, filled always with one\nimage, suffered the pangs of death. Was he then doomed to see work fail\nnow its effect, he who had always considered it of sovereign power,\nthe creator and ruler of the world? Must he then throw away his pen,\nrenounce action, and do nothing in future but exist? And tears would\nflow down his white beard; and if he heard Clotilde coming upstairs\nagain he would seize his pen quickly, in order that she might find him\nas she had left him, buried seemingly in profound meditation, when his\nmind was now only an aching void.\n\nIt was now the middle of September; two weeks that had seemed\ninterminable had passed in this distressing condition of things, without\nbringing any solution, when one morning Clotilde was greatly surprised\nby seeing her grandmother, Felicite, enter. Pascal had met his mother\nthe day before in the Rue de la Banne, and, impatient to consummate the\nsacrifice, and not finding in himself the strength to make the rupture,\nhe had confided in her, in spite of his repugnance, and begged her to\ncome on the following day. As it happened, she had just received another\nletter from Maxime, a despairing and imploring letter.\n\nShe began by explaining her presence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, it is I, my dear, and you can understand that only very weighty\nreasons could have induced me to set my foot here again. But, indeed,\nyou are getting crazy; I cannot allow you to ruin your life in this way,\nwithout making a last effort to open your eyes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe then read Maxime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter in a tearful voice. He was nailed to an\narmchair. It seemed he was suffering from a form of ataxia, rapid in its\nprogress and very painful. Therefore he requested a decided answer\nfrom his sister, hoping still that she would come, and trembling at the\nthought of being compelled to seek another nurse. This was what he would\nbe obliged to do, however, if they abandoned him in his sad condition.\nAnd when she had finished reading the letter she hinted that it would be\na great pity to let Maxime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fortune pass into the hands of strangers;\nbut, above all, she spoke of duty; of the assistance one owed to a\nrelation, she, too, affecting to believe that a formal promise had been\ngiven.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, my dear, call upon your memory. You told him that if he should\never need you, you would go to him; I can hear you saying it now. Was it\nnot so, my son?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal, his face pale, his head slightly bent, had kept silence since\nhis mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entrance, leaving her to act. He answered only by an\naffirmative nod.\n\nThen Felicite went over all the arguments that he himself had employed\nto persuade Clotilde--the dreadful scandal, to which insult was now\nadded; impending want, so hard for them both; the impossibility of\ncontinuing the life they were leading. What future could they hope for,\nnow that they had been overtaken by poverty? It was stupid and cruel to\npersist longer in her obstinate refusal.\n\nClotilde, standing erect and with an impenetrable countenance, remained\nsilent, refusing even to discuss the question. But as her grandmother\ntormented her to give an answer, she said at last:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce more, I have no duty whatever toward my brother; my duty is here.\nHe can dispose of his fortune as he chooses; I want none of it. When\nwe are too poor, master shall send away Martine and keep me as his\nservant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOld Mme. Rougon wagged her chin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBefore being his servant it would be better if you had begun by being\nhis wife. Why have you not got married? It would have been simpler and\nmore proper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd Felicite reminded her how she had come one day to urge this\nmarriage, in order to put an end to gossip, and how the young girl had\nseemed greatly surprised, saying that neither she nor the doctor had\nthought of it, but that, notwithstanding, they would get married later\non, if necessary, for there was no hurry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGet married; I am quite willing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Clotilde. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are right,\ngrandmother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd turning to Pascal:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have told me a hundred times that you would do whatever I wished.\nMarry me; do you hear? I will be your wife, and I will stay here. A wife\ndoes not leave her husband.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut he answered only by a gesture, as if he feared that his voice\nwould betray him, and that he should accept, in a cry of gratitude, the\neternal bond which she had proposed to him. His gesture might signify a\nhesitation, a refusal. What was the good of this marriage _in extremis_,\nwhen everything was falling to pieces?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThose are very fine sentiments, no doubt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned Felicite. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have\nsettled it all in your own little head. But marriage will not give you\nan income; and, meantime, you are a great expense to him; you are the\nheaviest of his burdens.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe effect which these words had upon Clotilde was extraordinary. She\nturned violently to Pascal, her cheeks crimson, her eyes filled with\ntears.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster, master! is what grandmother has just said true? Has it come to\nthis, that you regret the money I cost you here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal grew still paler; he remained motionless, in an attitude of utter\ndejection. But in a far-away voice, as if he were talking to himself, he\nmurmured:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have so much work to do! I should like to go over my envelopes, my\nmanuscripts, my notes, and complete the work of my life. If I were\nalone perhaps I might be able to arrange everything. I would sell La\nSouleiade, oh! for a crust of bread, for it is not worth much. I should\nshut myself and my papers in a little room. I should work from morning\ntill night, and I should try not to be too unhappy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut he avoided her glance; and, agitated as she was, these painful and\nstammering utterances were not calculated to satisfy her. She grew every\nmoment more and more terrified, for she felt that the irrevocable word\nwas about to be spoken.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook at me, master, look me in the face. And I conjure you, be brave,\nchoose between your work and me, since you say, it seems, that you send\nme away that you may work the better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe moment for the heroic falsehood had come. He lifted his head and\nlooked her bravely in the face, and with the smile of a dying man who\ndesires death, recovering his voice of divine goodness, he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow excited you get! Can you not do your duty quietly, like everybody\nelse? I have a great deal of work to do, and I need to be alone; and\nyou, dear, you ought to go to your brother. Go then, everything is\nended.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a terrible silence for the space of a few seconds. She looked\nat him earnestly, hoping that he would change his mind. Was he really\nspeaking the truth? was he not sacrificing himself in order that she\nmight be happy? For a moment she had an intuition that this was the\ncase, as if some subtle breath, emanating from him, had warned her of\nit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you are sending me away forever? You will not permit me to come\nback to-morrow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut he held out bravely; with another smile he seemed to answer that\nwhen one went away like this it was not to come back again on the\nfollowing day. She was now completely bewildered; she knew not what to\nthink. It might be possible that he had chosen work sincerely; that the\nman of science had gained the victory over the lover. She grew still\npaler, and she waited a little longer, in the terrible silence; then,\nslowly, with her air of tender and absolute submission, she said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, master, I will go away whenever you wish, and I will not\nreturn until you send for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe die was cast. The irrevocable was accomplished. Each felt that\nneither would attempt to recall the decision that had been made; and,\nfrom this instant, every minute that passed would bring nearer the\nseparation.\n\nFelicite, surprised at not being obliged to say more, at once desired\nto fix the time for Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure. She applauded herself for her\ntenacity; she thought she had gained the victory by main force. It\nwas now Friday, and it was settled that Clotilde should leave on the\nfollowing Sunday. A despatch was even sent to Maxime.\n\nFor the past three days the mistral had been blowing. But on this\nevening its fury was redoubled, and Martine declared, in accordance with\nthe popular belief, that it would last for three days longer. The winds\nat the end of September, in the valley of the Viorne, are terrible. So\nthat the servant took care to go into every room in the house to assure\nherself that the shutters were securely fastened. When the mistral blew\nit caught La Souleiade slantingly, above the roofs of the houses of\nPlassans, on the little plateau on which the house was built. And now it\nraged and beat against the house, shaking it from garret to cellar, day\nand night, without a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cessation. The tiles were blown off, the\nfastenings of the windows were torn away, while the wind, entering the\ncrevices, moaned and sobbed wildly through the house; and the doors, if\nthey were left open for a moment, through forgetfulness, slammed to with\na noise like the report of a cannon. They might have fancied they were\nsustaining a siege, so great were the noise and the discomfort.\n\nIt was in this melancholy house shaken by the storm that Pascal, on\nthe following day, helped Clotilde to make her preparations for her\ndeparture. Old Mme. Rougon was not to return until Sunday, to say\ngood-by. When Martine was informed of the approaching separation,\nshe stood still in dumb amazement, and a flash, quickly extinguished,\nlighted her eyes; and as they sent her out of the room, saying that they\nwould not require her assistance in packing the trunks, she returned\nto the kitchen and busied herself in her usual occupations, seeming to\nignore the catastrophe which was about to revolutionize their household\nof three. But at Pascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slightest call she would run so promptly and\nwith such alacrity, her face so bright and so cheerful, in her zeal\nto serve him, that she seemed like a young girl. Pascal did not leave\nClotilde for a moment, helping her, desiring to assure himself that she\nwas taking with her everything she could need. Two large trunks stood\nopen in the middle of the disordered room; bundles and articles of\nclothing lay about everywhere; twenty times the drawers and the presses\nhad been visited. And in this work, this anxiety to forget nothing, the\npainful sinking of the heart which they both felt was in some measure\nlessened. They forgot for an instant--he watching carefully to see that\nno space was lost, utilizing the hat-case for the smaller articles of\nclothing, slipping boxes in between the folds of the linen; while she,\ntaking down the gowns, folded them on the bed, waiting to put them\nlast in the top tray. Then, when a little tired they stood up and found\nthemselves again face to face, they would smile at each other at first;\nthen choke back the sudden tears that started at the recollection of the\nimpending and inevitable misfortune. But though their hearts bled they\nremained firm. Good God! was it then true that they were to be no\nlonger together? And then they heard the wind, the terrible wind, which\nthreatened to blow down the house.\n\nHow many times during this last day did they not go over to the window,\nattracted by the storm, wishing that it would sweep away the world.\nDuring these squalls the sun did not cease to shine, the sky remained\nconstantly blue, but a livid blue, windswept and dusty, and the sun was\na yellow sun, pale and cold. They saw in the distance the vast white\nclouds rising from the roads, the trees bending before the blast,\nlooking as if they were flying all in the same direction, at the same\nrate of speed; the whole country parched and exhausted by the unvarying\nviolence of the wind that blew ceaselessly, with a roar like thunder.\nBranches were snapped and whirled out of sight; roofs were lifted up and\ncarried so far away that they were never afterward found. Why could not\nthe mistral take them all up together and carry them off to some unknown\nland, where they might be happy? The trunks were almost packed when\nPascal went to open one of the shutters that the wind had blown to, but\nso fierce a gust swept in through the half open window that Clotilde had\nto go to his assistance. Leaning with all their weight, they were able\nat last to turn the catch. The articles of clothing in the room were\nblown about, and they gathered up in fragments a little hand mirror\nwhich had fallen from a chair. Was this a sign of approaching death, as\nthe women of the faubourg said?\n\nIn the evening, after a mournful dinner in the bright dining-room,\nwith its great bouquets of flowers, Pascal said he would retire early.\nClotilde was to leave on the following morning by the ten o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock\ntrain, and he feared for her the long journey--twenty hours of railway\ntraveling. But when he had retired he was unable to sleep. At first he\nthought it was the wind that kept him awake. The sleeping house was\nfull of cries, voices of entreaty and voices of anger, mingled together,\naccompanied by endless sobbing. Twice he got up and went to listen at\nClotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door, but he heard nothing. He went downstairs to close a\ndoor that banged persistently, like misfortune knocking at the walls.\nGusts blew through the dark rooms, and he went to bed again, shivering\nand haunted by lugubrious visions.\n\nAt six o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock Martine, fancying she heard her master knocking for her\non the floor of his room, went upstairs. She entered the room with the\nalert and excited expression which she had worn for the past two days;\nbut she stood still, astonished and uneasy, when she saw him lying,\nhalf-dressed, across his bed, haggard, biting the pillow to stifle his\nsobs. He got out of bed and tried to finish dressing himself, but a\nfresh attack seized him, and, his head giddy and his heart palpitating\nto suffocation, recovering from a momentary faintness, he faltered in\nagonized tones:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, I cannot; I suffer too much. I would rather die, die now--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe recognized Martine, and abandoning himself to his grief, his strength\ntotally gone, he made his confession to her:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy poor girl, I suffer too much, my heart is breaking. She is taking\naway my heart with her, she is taking away my whole being. I cannot live\nwithout her. I almost died last night. I would be glad to die before her\ndeparture, not to have the anguish of seeing her go away. Oh, my God!\nshe is going away, and I shall have her no longer, and I shall be left\nalone, alone, alone!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe servant, who had gone upstairs so gaily, turned as pale as wax, and\na hard and bitter look came into her face. For a moment she watched him\nclutching the bedclothes convulsively, uttering hoarse cries of despair,\nhis face pressed against the coverlet. Then, by a violent effort, she\nseemed to make up her mind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, monsieur, there is no sense in making trouble for yourself in\nthis way. It is ridiculous. Since that is how it is, and you cannot do\nwithout mademoiselle, I shall go and tell her what a state you have let\nyourself get into.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt these words he got up hastily, staggering still, and, leaning for\nsupport on the back of a chair, he cried:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI positively forbid you to do so, Martine!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA likely thing that I should listen to you, seeing you like that! To\nfind you some other time half dead, crying your eyes out! No, no! I\nshall go to mademoiselle and tell her the truth, and compel her to\nremain with us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut he caught her angrily by the arm and held her fast.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI command you to keep quiet, do you hear? Or you shall go with her!\nWhy did you come in? It was this wind that made me ill. That concerns no\none.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, yielding to a good-natured impulse, with his usual kindness of\nheart, he smiled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy poor girl, see how you vex me? Let me act as I ought, for the\nhappiness of others. And not another word; you would pain me greatly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMartine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes, too, filled with tears. It was just in time that they\nmade peace, for Clotilde entered almost immediately. She had risen\nearly, eager to see Pascal, hoping doubtless, up to the last moment,\nthat he would keep her. Her own eyelids were heavy from want of sleep,\nand she looked at him steadily as she entered, with her inquiring air.\nBut he was still so discomposed that she began to grow uneasy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, indeed, I assure you, I would even have slept well but for the\nmistral. I was just telling you so, Martine, was I not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe servant confirmed his words by an affirmative nod. And Clotilde,\ntoo, submitted, saying nothing of the night of anguish and mental\nconflict she had spent while he, on his side, had been suffering the\npangs of death. Both of the women now docilely obeyed and aided him, in\nhis heroic self-abnegation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, opening his desk, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have something here for you.\nThere! there are seven hundred francs in that envelope.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd in spite of her exclamations and protestations he persisted in\nrendering her an account. Of the six thousand francs obtained by the\nsale of the jewels two hundred only had been spent, and he had kept one\nhundred to last till the end of the month, with the strict economy, the\npenuriousness, which he now displayed. Afterward he would no doubt sell\nLa Souleiade, he would work, he would be able to extricate himself from\nhis difficulties. But he would not touch the five thousand francs which\nremained, for they were her property, her own, and she would find them\nagain in the drawer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster, master, you are giving me a great deal of pain--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he interrupted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand it is you who are trying to break my\nheart. Come, it is half-past seven, I will go and cord your trunks since\nthey are locked.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen Martine and Clotilde were alone and face to face they looked at\neach other for a moment in silence. Ever since the commencement of the\nnew situation, they had been fully conscious of their secret antagonism,\nthe open triumph of the young mistress, the half concealed jealousy of\nthe old servant about her adored master. Now it seemed that the victory\nremained with the servant. But in this final moment their common emotion\ndrew them together.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMartine, you must not let him eat like a poor man. You promise me that\nhe shall have wine and meat every day?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave no fear, mademoiselle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the five thousand francs lying there, you know belong to him. You\nare not going to let yourselves starve to death, I suppose, with those\nthere. I want you to treat him very well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell you that I will make it my business to do so, mademoiselle, and\nthat monsieur shall want for nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s silence. They were still regarding each other.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd watch him, to see that he does not overwork himself. I am going\naway very uneasy; he has not been well for some time past. Take good\ncare of him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMake your mind easy, mademoiselle, I will take care of him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I give him into your charge. He will have only you now; and it is\nsome consolation to me to know that you love him dearly. Love him with\nall your strength. Love him for us both.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, mademoiselle, as much as I can.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTears came into their eyes; Clotilde spoke again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you embrace me, Martine?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, mademoiselle, very gladly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey were in each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms when Pascal reentered the room. He\npretended not to see them, doubtless afraid of giving way to his\nemotion. In an unnaturally loud voice he spoke of the final preparations\nfor Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure, like a man who had a great deal on his hands\nand was afraid that the train might be missed. He had corded the trunks,\na man had taken them away in a little wagon, and they would find them at\nthe station. But it was only eight o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, and they had still two long\nhours before them. Two hours of mortal anguish, spent in unoccupied\nand weary waiting, during which they tasted a hundred times over the\nbitterness of parting. The breakfast took hardly a quarter of an hour.\nThen they got up, to sit down again. Their eyes never left the clock.\nThe minutes seemed long as those of a death watch, throughout the\nmournful house.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow the wind blows!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Clotilde, as a sudden gust made all the doors\ncreak.\n\nPascal went over to the window and watched the wild flight of the\nstorm-blown trees.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt has increased since morning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPresently I must see to the\nroof, for some of the tiles have been blown away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAlready they had ceased to be one household. They listened in silence to\nthe furious wind, sweeping everything before it, carrying with it their\nlife.\n\nFinally Pascal looked for a last time at the clock, and said simply:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is time, Clotilde.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe rose from the chair on which she had been sitting. She had for an\ninstant forgotten that she was going away, and all at once the dreadful\nreality came back to her. Once more she looked at him, but he did not\nopen his arms to keep her. It was over; her hope was dead. And from this\nmoment her face was like that of one struck with death.\n\nAt first they exchanged the usual commonplaces.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will write to me, will you not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly, and you must let me hear from you as often as possible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbove all, if you should fall ill, send for me at once.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI promise you that I will do so. But there is no danger. I am very\nstrong.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, when the moment came in which she was to leave this dear house,\nClotilde looked around with unsteady gaze; then she threw herself on\nPascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breast, she held him for an instant in her arms, faltering:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish to embrace you here, I wish to thank you. Master, it is you who\nhave made me what I am. As you have often told me, you have corrected\nmy heredity. What should I have become amid the surroundings in which\nMaxime has grown up? Yes, if I am worth anything, it is to you alone\nI owe it, you, who transplanted me into this abode of kindness and\naffection, where you have brought me up worthy of you. Now, after having\ntaken me and overwhelmed me with benefits, you send me away. Be it as\nyou will, you are my master, and I will obey you. I love you, in spite\nof all, and I shall always love you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe pressed her to his heart, answering:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI desire only your good, I am completing my work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen they reached the station, Clotilde vowed to herself that she would\none day come back. Old Mme. Rougon was there, very gay and very brisk,\nin spite of her eighty-and-odd years. She was triumphant now; she\nthought she would have her son Pascal at her mercy. When she saw them\nboth stupefied with grief she took charge of everything; got the ticket,\nregistered the baggage, and installed the traveler in a compartment\nin which there were only ladies. Then she spoke for a long time\nabout Maxime, giving instructions and asking to be kept informed of\neverything. But the train did not start; there were still five cruel\nminutes during which they remained face to face, without speaking to\neach other. Then came the end, there were embraces, a great noise of\nwheels, and waving of handkerchiefs.\n\nSuddenly Pascal became aware that he was standing alone upon the\nplatform, while the train was disappearing around a bend in the road.\nThen, without listening to his mother, he ran furiously up the slope,\nsprang up the stone steps like a young man, and found himself in three\nminutes on the terrace of La Souleiade. The mistral was raging there--a\nfierce squall which bent the secular cypresses like straws. In the\ncolorless sky the sun seemed weary of the violence of the wind, which\nfor six days had been sweeping over its face. And like the wind-blown\ntrees Pascal stood firm, his garments flapping like banners, his beard\nand hair blown about and lashed by the storm. His breath caught by the\nwind, his hands pressed upon his heart to quiet its throbbing, he saw\nthe train flying in the distance across the bare plain, a little train\nwhich the mistral seemed to sweep before it like a dry branch.\n\n\n\n\nXII.\n\nFrom the day following Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure, Pascal shut himself up in\nthe great empty house. He did not leave it again, ceasing entirely the\nrare professional visits which he had still continued to make, living\nthere with doors and windows closed, in absolute silence and solitude.\nMartine had received formal orders to admit no one under any pretext\nwhatever.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut your mother, monsieur, Mme. Felicite?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy mother, less than any one else; I have my reasons. Tell her that\nI am working, that I require to concentrate my thoughts, and that I\nrequest her to excuse me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThree times in succession old Mme. Rougon had presented herself. She\nwould storm at the hall door. He would hear her voice rising in anger as\nshe tried in vain to force her way in. Then the noise would be stilled,\nand there would be only a whisper of complaint and plotting between her\nand the servant. But not once did he yield, not once did he lean over\nthe banisters and call to her to come up.\n\nOne day Martine ventured to say to him:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is very hard, all the same, monsieur, to refuse admittance to one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nmother. The more so, as Mme. Felicite comes with good intentions, for\nshe knows the straits that monsieur is in, and she insists only in order\nto offer her services.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMoney!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, exasperated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want no money, do you hear? And\nfrom her less than anybody. I will work, I will earn my own living; why\nshould I not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe question of money, however, began to grow pressing. He obstinately\nrefused to take another sou from the five thousand francs locked up\nin the desk. Now that he was alone, he was completely indifferent to\nmaterial things; he would have been satisfied to live on bread and\nwater; and every time the servant asked him for money to buy wine, meat,\nor sweets, he shrugged his shoulders--what was the use? there remained a\ncrust from the day before, was not that sufficient? But in her affection\nfor her master, whom she felt to be suffering, the old servant was\nheart-broken at this miserliness which exceeded her own; this utter\ndestitution to which he abandoned himself and the whole house. The\nworkmen of the faubourgs lived better. Thus it was that for a whole day\na terrible conflict went on within her. Her doglike love struggled with\nher love for her money, amassed sou by sou, hidden away, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaking more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n as she said. She would rather have parted with a piece of her flesh.\nSo long as her master had not suffered alone the idea of touching her\ntreasure had not even occurred to her. And she displayed extraordinary\nheroism the morning when, driven to extremity, seeing her stove cold\nand the larder empty, she disappeared for an hour and then returned with\nprovisions and the change of a hundred-franc note.\n\nPascal, who just then chanced to come downstairs, asked her in\nastonishment where the money had come from, furious already, and\nprepared to throw it all into the street, imagining she had applied to\nhis mother.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, no; why, no, monsieur!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she stammered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is not that at all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she told him the story that she had prepared.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cImagine, M. Grandguillot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s affairs are going to be settled--or at least\nI think so. It occurred to me this morning to go to the assignee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to\ninquire, and he told me that you would undoubtedly recover something,\nand that I might have a hundred francs now. Yes, he was even satisfied\nwith a receipt from me. He knows me, and you can make it all right\nafterward.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal seemed scarcely surprised. She had calculated correctly that he\nwould not go out to verify her account. She was relieved, however, to\nsee with what easy indifference he accepted her story.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, so much the better!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see now that one must never\ndespair. That will give me time to settle my affairs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis \u00e2\u0080\u009caffairs\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the sale of La Souleiade, about which he had been\nthinking vaguely. But what a grief to leave this house in which Clotilde\nhad grown up, where they had lived together for nearly eighteen years!\nHe had taken two or three weeks already to reflect over the matter. Now\nthat he had the hope of getting back a little of the money he had lost\nthrough the notary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failure, he ceased to think any more about it. He\nrelapsed into his former indifference, eating whatever Martine served\nhim, not even noticing the comforts with which she once more surrounded\nhim, in humble adoration, heart-broken at giving her money, but very\nhappy to support him now, without his suspecting that his sustenance\ncame from her.\n\nBut Pascal rewarded her very ill. Afterward he would be sorry, and\nregret his outbursts. But in the state of feverish desperation in which\nhe lived this did not prevent him from again flying into a passion with\nher, at the slightest cause of dissatisfaction. One evening, after he\nhad been listening to his mother talking for an interminable time with\nher in the kitchen, he cried in sudden fury:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMartine, I do not wish her to enter La Souleiade again, do you hear? If\nyou ever let her into the house again I will turn you out!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe listened to him in surprise. Never, during the thirty-two years in\nwhich she had been in his service, had he threatened to dismiss her in\nthis way. Big tears came to her eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, monsieur! you would not have the courage to do it! And I would not\ngo. I would lie down across the threshold first.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe already regretted his anger, and he said more gently:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe thing is that I know perfectly well what is going on. She comes\nto indoctrinate you, to put you against me, is it not so? Yes, she is\nwatching my papers; she wishes to steal and destroy everything up there\nin the press. I know her; when she wants anything, she never gives up\nuntil she gets it. Well, you can tell her that I am on my guard; that\nwhile I am alive she shall never even come near the press. And the key\nis here in my pocket.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn effect, all his former terror--the terror of the scientist who feels\nhimself surrounded by secret enemies, had returned. Ever since he\nhad been living alone in the deserted house he had had a feeling of\nreturning danger, of being constantly watched in secret. The circle had\nnarrowed, and if he showed such anger at these attempts at invasion,\nif he repulsed his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assaults, it was because he did not deceive\nhimself as to her real plans, and he was afraid that he might yield. If\nshe were there she would gradually take possession of him, until she had\nsubjugated him completely. Therefore his former tortures returned,\nand he passed the days watching; he shut up the house himself in the\nevening, and he would often rise during the night, to assure himself\nthat the locks were not being forced. What he feared was that the\nservant, won over by his mother, and believing she was securing his\neternal welfare, would open the door to Mme. Felicite. In fancy he saw\nthe papers blazing in the fireplace; he kept constant guard over them,\nseized again by a morbid love, a torturing affection for this icy heap\nof papers, these cold pages of manuscript, to which he had sacrificed\nthe love of woman, and which he tried to love sufficiently to be able to\nforget everything else for them.\n\nPascal, now that Clotilde was no longer there, threw himself eagerly\ninto work, trying to submerge himself in it, to lose himself in it. If\nhe secluded himself, if he did not set foot even in the garden, if\nhe had had the strength, one day when Martine came up to announce Dr.\nRamond, to answer that he would not receive him, he had, in this bitter\ndesire for solitude, no other aim than to kill thought by incessant\nlabor. That poor Ramond, how gladly he would have embraced him! for\nhe divined clearly the delicacy of feeling that had made him hasten\nto console his old master. But why lose an hour? Why risk emotions and\ntears which would leave him so weak? From daylight he was at his table,\nhe spent at it his mornings and his afternoons, extended often into the\nevening after the lamp was lighted, and far into the night. He wished\nto put his old project into execution--to revise his whole theory\nof heredity, employing the documents furnished by his own family to\nestablish the laws according to which, in a certain group of human\nbeings, life is distributed and conducted with mathematical precision\nfrom one to another, taking into account the environment--a vast bible,\nthe genesis of families, of societies, of all humanity. He hoped that\nthe vastness of such a plan, the effort necessary to develop so colossal\nan idea, would take complete possession of him, restoring to him his\nhealth, his faith, his pride in the supreme joy of the accomplished\nwork. But it was in vain that he threw himself passionately,\npersistently, without reserve, into his work; he succeeded only in\nfatiguing his body and his mind, without even being able to fix his\nthoughts or to put his heart into his work, every day sicker and more\ndespairing. Had work, then, finally lost its power? He whose life\nhad been spent in work, who had regarded it as the sole motor, the\nbenefactor, and the consoler, must he then conclude that to love and\nto be loved is beyond all else in the world? Occasionally he would\nhave great thoughts, he continued to sketch out his new theory of the\nequilibrium of forces, demonstrating that what man receives in sensation\nhe should return in action. How natural, full, and happy would life\nbe if it could be lived entire, performing its functions like a\nwell-ordered machine, giving back in power what was consumed in fuel,\nmaintaining itself in vigor and in beauty by the simultaneous and\nlogical play of all its organs. He believed physical and intellectual\nlabor, feeling and reasoning should be in equal proportions, and\nnever excessive, for excess meant disturbance of the equilibrium and,\nconsequently, disease. Yes, yes, to begin life over again and to know\nhow to live it, to dig the earth, to study man, to love woman, to attain\nto human perfection, the future city of universal happiness, through the\nharmonious working of the entire being, what a beautiful legacy for\na philosophical physician to leave behind him would this be! And this\ndream of the future, this theory, confusedly perceived, filled him with\nbitterness at the thought that now his life was a force wasted and lost.\n\nAt the very bottom of his grief Pascal had the dominating feeling that\nfor him life was ended. Regret for Clotilde, sorrow at having her no\nlonger beside him, the certainty that he would never see her again,\nfilled him with overwhelming grief. Work had lost its power, and he\nwould sometimes let his head drop on the page he was writing, and weep\nfor hours together, unable to summon courage to take up the pen again.\nHis passion for work, his days of voluntary fatigue, led to terrible\nnights, nights of feverish sleeplessness, in which he would stuff the\nbedclothes into his mouth to keep from crying out Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name. She\nwas everywhere in this mournful house in which he secluded himself.\nHe saw her again, walking through the rooms, sitting on the chairs,\nstanding behind the doors. Downstairs, in the dining-room, he could not\nsit at table, without seeing her opposite him. In the workroom upstairs\nshe was still his constant companion, for she, too, had lived so long\nsecluded in it that her image seemed reflected from everything; he felt\nher constantly beside him, he could fancy he saw her standing before her\ndesk, straight and slender--her delicate face bent over a pastel. And if\nhe did not leave the house to escape from the dear and torturing memory\nit was because he had the certainty that he should find her everywhere\nin the garden, too: dreaming on the terrace; walking with slow steps\nthrough the alleys in the pine grove; sitting under the shade of the\nplane trees; lulled by the eternal song of the fountain; lying in the\nthreshing yard at twilight, her gaze fixed on space, waiting for\nthe stars to come out. But above all, there existed for him a sacred\nsanctuary which he could not enter without trembling--the chamber where\nshe had confessed her love. He kept the key of it; he had not moved\na single object from its place since the sorrowful morning of her\ndeparture; and a skirt which she had forgotten lay still upon her\narmchair. He opened his arms wildly to clasp her shade floating in the\nsoft half light of the room, with its closed shutters and its walls hung\nwith the old faded pink calico, of a dawnlike tint.\n\nIn the midst of his unremitting toil Pascal had another melancholy\npleasure--Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letters. She wrote to him regularly twice a week,\nlong letters of eight or ten pages, in which she described to him all\nher daily life. She did not seem to lead a very happy life in Paris.\nMaxime, who did not now leave his sick chair, evidently tortured her\nwith the exactions of a spoiled child and an invalid. She spoke as if\nshe lived in complete retirement, always waiting on him, so that she\ncould not even go over to the window to look out on the avenue, along\nwhich rolled the fashionable stream of the promenaders of the Bois; and\nfrom certain of her expressions it could be divined that her brother,\nafter having entreated her so urgently to go to him, suspected her\nalready, and had begun to regard her with hatred and distrust, as he did\nevery one who approached him, in his continual fear of being made use of\nand robbed. He did not give her the keys, treating her like a servant to\nwhom he found it difficult to accustom himself. Twice she had seen her\nfather, who was, as always, very gay, and overwhelmed with business; he\nhad been converted to the Republic, and was at the height of political\nand financial success. Saccard had even taken her aside, to sympathize\nwith her, saying that poor Maxime was really insupportable, and that she\nwould be truly courageous if she consented to be made his victim. As she\ncould not do everything, he had even had the kindness to send her,\non the following day, the niece of his hairdresser, a fair-haired,\ninnocent-looking girl of eighteen, named Rose, who was assisting her\nnow to take care of the invalid. But Clotilde made no complaint; she\naffected, on the contrary, to be perfectly tranquil, contented, and\nresigned to everything. Her letters were full of courage, showing\nneither anger nor sorrow at the cruel separation, making no desperate\nappeal to Pascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s affection to recall her. But between the lines, he\ncould perceive that she trembled with rebellious anger, that her\nwhole being yearned for him, that she was ready to commit the folly of\nreturning to him immediately, at his lightest word.\n\nAnd this was the one word that Pascal would not write. Everything would\nbe arranged in time. Maxime would become accustomed to his sister; the\nsacrifice must be completed now that it had been begun. A single line\nwritten by him in a moment of weakness, and all the advantage of the\neffort he had made would be lost, and their misery would begin again.\nNever had Pascal had greater need of courage than when he was answering\nClotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letters. At night, burning with fever, he would toss about,\ncalling on her wildly; then he would get up and write to her to come\nback at once. But when day came, and he had exhausted himself with\nweeping, his fever abated, and his answer was always very short, almost\ncold. He studied every sentence, beginning the letter over again when\nhe thought he had forgotten himself. But what a torture, these dreadful\nletters, so short, so icy, in which he went against his heart, solely\nin order to wean her from him gradually, to take upon himself all the\nblame, and to make her believe that she could forget him, since he\nforgot her. They left him covered with perspiration, and as exhausted as\nif he had just performed some great act of heroism.\n\nOne morning toward the end of October, a month after Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndeparture, Pascal had a sudden attack of suffocation. He had had,\nseveral times already, slight attacks, which he attributed to overwork.\nBut this time the symptoms were so plain that he could not mistake\nthem--a sharp pain in the region of the heart, extending over the whole\nchest and along the left arm, and a dreadful sensation of oppression and\ndistress, while cold perspiration broke out upon him. It was an attack\nof angina pectoris. It lasted hardly more than a minute, and he was\nat first more surprised than frightened. With that blindness which\nphysicians often show where their own health is concerned, he never\nsuspected that his heart might be affected.\n\nAs he was recovering his breath Martine came up to say that Dr. Ramond\nwas downstairs, and again begged the doctor to see him. And Pascal,\nyielding perhaps to an unconscious desire to know the truth, cried:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, let him come up, since he insists upon it. I will be glad to see\nhim.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe two men embraced each other, and no other allusion was made to the\nabsent one, to her whose departure had left the house empty, than an\nenergetic and sad hand clasp.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why I have come?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Ramond immediately. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is about\na question of money. Yes, my father-in-law, M. Leveque, the advocate,\nwhom you know, spoke to me yesterday again about the funds which you had\nwith the notary Grandguillot. And he advises you strongly to take some\naction in the matter, for some persons have succeeded, he says, in\nrecovering something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I know that that business is being settled,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Pascal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMartine\nhas already got two hundred francs out of it, I believe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMartine?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ramond, looking greatly surprised, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow could she\ndo that without your intervention? However, will you authorize my\nfather-in-law to undertake your case? He will see the assignee, and sift\nthe whole affair, since you have neither the time nor the inclination to\nattend to it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly, I authorize M. Leveque to do so, and tell him that I thank\nhim a thousand times.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen this matter being settled, the young man, remarking the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npallor, and questioning him as to its cause, Pascal answered with a\nsmile:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cImagine, my friend, I have just had an attack of angina pectoris. Oh,\nit is not imagination, all the symptoms were there. And stay! since you\nare here you shall sound me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt first Ramond refused, affecting to turn the consultation into a\njest. Could a raw recruit like him venture to pronounce judgment on\nhis general? But he examined him, notwithstanding, seeing that his face\nlooked drawn and pained, with a singular look of fright in the eyes. He\nended by auscultating him carefully, keeping his ear pressed closely to\nhis chest for a considerable time. Several minutes passed in profound\nsilence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Pascal, when the young physician stood up.\n\nThe latter did not answer at once. He felt the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes looking\nstraight into his; and as the question had been put to him with quiet\ncourage, he answered in the same way:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, it is true, I think there is some sclerosis.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! it was kind of you not to attempt to deceive me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned the\ndoctor, smiling. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI feared for an instant that you would tell me an\nuntruth, and that would have hurt me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRamond, listening again, said in an undertone:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, the beat is strong, the first sound is dull, while the second, on\nthe contrary, is sharp. It is evident that the apex has descended and is\nturned toward the armpit. There is some sclerosis, at least it is very\nprobable. One may live twenty years with that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he ended, straightening\nhimself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo doubt, sometimes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Pascal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt least, unless one chances to die\nof a sudden attack.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey talked for some time longer, discussed a remarkable case of\nsclerosis of the heart, which they had seen at the hospital at Plassans.\nAnd when the young physician went away, he said that he would return as\nsoon as he should have news of the Grandguillot liquidation.\n\nBut when he was alone Pascal felt that he was lost. Everything was now\nexplained: his palpitations for some weeks past, his attacks of vertigo\nand suffocation; above all that weakness of the organ, of his poor\nheart, overtasked by feeling and by work, that sense of intense fatigue\nand impending death, regarding which he could no longer deceive himself.\nIt was not as yet fear that he experienced, however. His first thought\nwas that he, too, would have to pay for his heredity, that sclerosis\nwas the species of degeneration which was to be his share of the\nphysiological misery, the inevitable inheritance bequeathed him by his\nterrible ancestry. In others the neurosis, the original lesion, had\nturned to vice or virtue, genius, crime, drunkenness, sanctity; others\nagain had died of consumption, of epilepsy, of ataxia; he had lived\nin his feelings and he would die of an affection of the heart. And\nhe trembled no longer, he rebelled no longer against this manifest\nheredity, fated and inevitable, no doubt. On the contrary, a feeling\nof humility took possession of him; the idea that all revolt against\nnatural laws is bad, that wisdom does not consist in holding one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self\napart, but in resigning one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self to be only a member of the whole\ngreat body. Why, then, was he so unwilling to belong to his family\nthat it filled him with triumph, that his heart beat with joy, when he\nbelieved himself different from them, without any community with them?\nNothing could be less philosophical. Only monsters grew apart. And to\nbelong to his family seemed to him in the end as good and as fine as\nto belong to any other family, for did not all families, in the main,\nresemble one another, was not humanity everywhere identical with the\nsame amount of good and evil? He came at last, humbly and gently, even\nin the face of impending suffering and death, to accept everything life\nhad to give him.\n\nFrom this time Pascal lived with the thought that he might die at any\nmoment. And this helped to perfect his character, to elevate him to a\ncomplete forgetfulness of self. He did not cease to work, but he had\nnever understood so well how much effort must seek its reward in itself,\nthe work being always transitory, and remaining of necessity incomplete.\nOne evening at dinner Martine informed him that Sarteur, the journeyman\nhatter, the former inmate of the asylum at the Tulettes, had just hanged\nhimself. All the evening he thought of this strange case, of this man\nwhom he had believed he had cured of homicidal mania by his treatment of\nhypodermic injections, and who, seized by a fresh attack, had evidently\nhad sufficient lucidity to hang himself, instead of springing at the\nthroat of some passer-by. He again saw him, so gentle, so reasonable,\nkissing his hands, while he was advising him to return to his life of\nhealthful labor. What then was this destructive and transforming force,\nthe desire to murder, changing to suicide, death performing its task\nin spite of everything? With the death of this man his last vestige of\npride as a healer disappeared; and each day when he returned to his work\nhe felt as if he were only a learner, spelling out his task, constantly\nseeking the truth, which as constantly receded from him, assuming ever\nmore formidable proportions.\n\nBut in the midst of his resignation one thought still troubled him--what\nwould become of Bonhomme, his old horse, if he himself should die before\nhim? The poor brute, completely blind and his limbs paralyzed, did\nnot now leave his litter. When his master went to see him, however, he\nturned his head, he could feel the two hearty kisses which were pressed\non his nose. All the neighbors shrugged their shoulders and joked about\nthis old relation whom the doctor would not allow to be slaughtered. Was\nhe then to be the first to go, with the thought that the knacker would\nbe called in on the following day. But one morning, when he entered the\nstable, Bonhomme did not hear him, did not raise his head. He was dead;\nhe lay there, with a peaceful expression, as if relieved that death had\ncome to him so gently. His master knelt beside him and kissed him again\nand bade him farewell, while two big tears rolled down his cheeks.\n\nIt was on this day that Pascal saw his neighbor, M. Bellombre, for the\nlast time. Going over to the window he perceived him in his garden, in\nthe pale sunshine of early November, taking his accustomed walk; and the\nsight of the old professor, living so completely happy in his solitude,\nfilled him at first with astonishment. He could never have imagined such\na thing possible, as that a man of sixty-nine should live thus, without\nwife or child, or even a dog, deriving his selfish happiness from\nthe joy of living outside of life. Then he recalled his fits of anger\nagainst this man, his sarcasms about his fear of life, the catastrophes\nwhich he had wished might happen to him, the hope that punishment would\ncome to him, in the shape of some housekeeper, or some female relation\ndropping down on him unexpectedly. But no, he was still as fresh as\never, and Pascal was sure that for a long time to come he would continue\nto grow old like this, hard, avaricious, useless, and happy. And yet\nhe no longer execrated him; he could even have found it in his heart\nto pity him, so ridiculous and miserable did he think him for not being\nloved. Pascal, who suffered the pangs of death because he was alone!\nHe whose heart was breaking because he was too full of others. Rather\nsuffering, suffering only, than this selfishness, this death of all\nthere is in us of living and human!\n\nIn the night which followed Pascal had another attack of angina\npectoris. It lasted for five minutes, and he thought that he would\nsuffocate without having the strength to call Martine. Then when he\nrecovered his breath, he did not disturb himself, preferring to speak to\nno one of this aggravation of his malady; but he had the certainty that\nit was all over with him, that he might not perhaps live a month longer.\nHis first thought was Clotilde. Should he then never see her again? and\nso sharp a pang seized him that he believed another attack was coming\non. Why should he not write to her to come to him? He had received a\nletter from her the day before; he would answer it this morning. Then\nthe thought of the envelopes occurred to him. If he should die suddenly,\nhis mother would be the mistress and she would destroy them; and not\nonly the envelopes, but his manuscripts, all his papers, thirty years of\nhis intelligence and his labor. Thus the crime which he had so greatly\ndreaded would be consummated, the crime of which the fear alone, during\nhis nights of fever, had made him get up out of bed trembling, his ear\non the stretch, listening to hear if they were forcing open the press.\nThe perspiration broke out upon him, he saw himself dispossessed,\noutraged, the ashes of his work thrown to the four winds. And when his\nthoughts reverted to Clotilde, he told himself that everything would be\nsatisfactorily arranged, that he had only to call her back--she would be\nhere, she would close his eyes, she would defend his memory. And he sat\ndown to write at once to her, so that the letter might go by the morning\nmail.\n\nBut when Pascal was seated before the white paper, with the pen between\nhis fingers, a growing doubt, a feeling of dissatisfaction with himself,\ntook possession of him. Was not this idea of his papers, this fine\nproject of providing a guardian for them and saving them, a suggestion\nof his weakness, an excuse which he gave himself to bring back Clotilde,\nand see her again? Selfishness was at the bottom of it. He was thinking\nof himself, not of her. He saw her returning to this poor house,\ncondemned to nurse a sick old man; and he saw her, above all, in her\ngrief, in her awful agony, when he should terrify her some day by\ndropping down dead at her side. No, no! this was the dreadful moment\nwhich he must spare her, those days of cruel adieus and want afterward,\na sad legacy which he could not leave her without thinking himself a\ncriminal. Her tranquillity, her happiness only, were of any consequence,\nthe rest did not matter. He would die in his hole, then, abandoned,\nhappy to think her happy, to spare her the cruel blow of his death. As\nfor saving his manuscripts he would perhaps find a means of doing so,\nhe would try to have the strength to part from them and give them to\nRamond. But even if all his papers were to perish, this was less of a\nsacrifice than to resign himself not to see her again, and he accepted\nit, and he was willing that nothing of him should survive, not even his\nthoughts, provided only that nothing of him should henceforth trouble\nher dear existence.\n\nPascal accordingly proceeded to write one of his usual answers,\nwhich, by a great effort, he purposely made colorless and almost cold.\nClotilde, in her last letter, without complaining of Maxime, had given\nit to be understood that her brother had lost his interest in her,\npreferring the society of Rose, the niece of Saccard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hairdresser, the\nfair-haired young girl with the innocent look. And he suspected strongly\nsome maneuver of the father: a cunning plan to obtain possession of the\ninheritance of the sick man, whose vices, so precocious formerly, gained\nnew force as his last hour approached. But in spite of his uneasiness he\ngave Clotilde very good advice, telling her that she must make allowance\nfor Maxime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sufferings, that he had undoubtedly a great deal of\naffection and gratitude for her, in short that it was her duty to devote\nherself to him to the end. When he signed the letter tears dimmed\nhis sight. It was his death warrant--a death like that of an old and\nsolitary brute, a death without a kiss, without the touch of a friendly\nhand--that he was signing. Never again would he embrace her. Then\ndoubts assailed him; was he doing right in leaving her amid such evil\nsurroundings, where he felt that she was in continual contact with every\nspecies of wickedness?\n\nThe postman brought the letters and newspapers to La Souleiade every\nmorning at about nine o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock; and Pascal, when he wrote to Clotilde,\nwas accustomed to watch for him, to give him his letter, so as to\nbe certain that his correspondence was not intercepted. But on this\nmorning, when he went downstairs to give him the letter he had just\nwritten, he was surprised to receive one from him from Clotilde,\nalthough it was not the usual day for her letters. He allowed his own to\ngo, however. Then he went upstairs, resumed his seat at his table, and\ntore open the envelope.\n\nThe letter was short, but its contents filled Pascal with a great joy.\n\n* * * * *\n\nBut the sound of footsteps made him control himself. He turned round and\nsaw Martine, who was saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDr. Ramond is downstairs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! let him come up, let him come up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nIt was another piece of good fortune that had come to him. Ramond cried\ngaily from the door:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVictory, master! I have brought you your money--not all, but a good\nsum.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he told the story--an unexpected piece of good luck which his\nfather-in-law, M. Leveque, had brought to light. The receipts for\nthe hundred and twenty thousand francs, which constituted Pascal the\npersonal creditor of Grandguillot, were valueless, since the latter was\ninsolvent. Salvation was to come from the power of attorney which the\ndoctor had sent him years before, at his request, that he might invest\nall or part of his money in mortgages. As the name of the proxy was in\nblank in the document, the notary, as is sometimes done, had made use\nof the name of one of his clerks, and eighty thousand francs, which had\nbeen invested in good mortgages, had thus been recovered through the\nagency of a worthy man who was not in the secrets of his employer. If\nPascal had taken action in the matter, if he had gone to the public\nprosecutor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office and the chamber of notaries, he would have\ndisentangled the matter long before. However, he had recovered a sure\nincome of four thousand francs.\n\nHe seized the young man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands and pressed them, smiling, his eyes\nstill moist with tears.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! my friend, if you knew how happy I am! This letter of Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhas brought me a great happiness. Yes, I was going to send for her; but\nthe thought of my poverty, of the privations she would have to endure\nhere, spoiled for me the joy of her return. And now fortune has come\nback, at least enough to set up my little establishment again!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn the expansion of his feelings he held out the letter to Ramond, and\nforced him to read it. Then when the young man gave it back to him,\nsmiling, comprehending the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emotion, and profoundly touched by\nit, yielding to an overpowering need of affection, he caught him in\nhis arms, like a comrade, a brother. The two men kissed each other\nvigorously on either cheek.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, since good fortune has sent you, I am going to ask another\nservice from you. You know I distrust every one around me, even my old\nhousekeeper. Will you take my despatch to the telegraph office!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe sat down again at the table, and wrote simply, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI await you; start\nto-night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto-day is the 6th of November, is it not? It is\nnow near ten o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock; she will have my despatch at noon. That will give\nher time enough to pack her trunks and to take the eight o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock express\nthis evening, which will bring her to Marseilles in time for breakfast.\nBut as there is no train which connects with it, she cannot be here\nuntil to-morrow, the 7th, at five o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter folding the despatch he rose:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy God, at five o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock to-morrow! How long to wait still! What shall I\ndo with myself until then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen a sudden recollection filled him with anxiety, and he became grave.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRamond, my comrade, will you give me a great proof of your friendship\nby being perfectly frank with me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow so, master?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, you understand me very well. The other day you examined me. Do you\nthink I can live another year?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe fixed his eyes on the young man as he spoke, compelling him to look\nat him. Ramond evaded a direct answer, however, with a jest--was it\nreally a physician who put such a question?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us be serious, Ramond, I beg of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen Ramond answered in all sincerity that, in his opinion, the doctor\nmight very justly entertain the hope of living another year. He gave his\nreasons--the comparatively slight progress which the sclerosis had made,\nand the absolute soundness of the other organs. Of course they must\nmake allowance for what they did not and could not know, for a sudden\naccident was always possible. And the two men discussed the case as if\nthey been in consultation at the bedside of a patient, weighing the\npros and cons, each stating his views and prognosticating a fatal\ntermination, in accordance with the symptoms as defined by the best\nauthorities.\n\nPascal, as if it were some one else who was in question, had recovered\nall his composure and his heroic self-forgetfulness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he murmured at last, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are right; a year of life is still\npossible. Ah, my friend, how I wish I might live two years; a mad wish,\nno doubt, an eternity of joy. And yet, two years, that would not\nbe impossible. I had a very curious case once, a wheelwright of\nthe faubourg, who lived for four years, giving the lie to all my\nprognostications. Two years, two years, I will live two years! I must\nlive two years!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRamond sat with bent head, without answering. He was beginning to\nbe uneasy, fearing that he had shown himself too optimistic; and the\ndoctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s joy disquieted and grieved him, as if this very exaltation,\nthis disturbance of a once strong brain, warned him of a secret and\nimminent danger.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you not wish to send that despatch at once?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes, go quickly, my good Ramond, and come back again to see us the\nday after to-morrow. She will be here then, and I want you to come and\nembrace us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe day was long, and the following morning, at about four o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock,\nshortly after Pascal had fallen asleep, after a happy vigil filled with\nhopes and dreams, he was wakened by a dreadful attack. He felt as if an\nenormous weight, as if the whole house, had fallen down upon his chest,\nso that the thorax, flattened down, touched the back. He could not\nbreathe; the pain reached the shoulders, then the neck, and paralyzed\nthe left arm. But he was perfectly conscious; he had the feeling that\nhis heart was about to stop, that life was about to leave him, in the\ndreadful oppression, like that of a vise, which was suffocating him.\nBefore the attack reached its height he had the strength to rise and to\nknock on the floor with a stick for Martine. Then he fell back on his\nbed, unable to speak or to move, and covered with a cold sweat.\n\nMartine, fortunately, in the profound silence of the empty house, heard\nthe knock. She dressed herself, wrapped a shawl about her, and went\nupstairs, carrying her candle. The darkness was still profound; dawn\nwas about to break. And when she perceived her master, whose eyes alone\nseemed living, looking at her with locked jaws, speechless, his face\ndistorted by pain, she was awed and terrified, and she could only rush\ntoward the bed crying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy God! My God! what is the matter, monsieur? Answer me, monsieur, you\nfrighten me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor a full minute Pascal struggled in vain to recover his breath. Then,\nthe viselike pressure on his chest relaxing slowly, he murmured in a\nfaint voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe five thousand francs in the desk are Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. Tell her that the\naffair of the notary is settled, that she will recover from it enough to\nlive upon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen Martine, who had listened to him in open-mouthed wonder, confessed\nthe falsehood she had told him, ignorant of the good news that had been\nbrought by Ramond.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMonsieur, you must forgive me; I told you an untruth. But it would be\nwrong to deceive you longer. When I saw you alone and so unhappy, I took\nsome of my own money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy poor girl, you did that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I had some hope that monsieur would return it to me one day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBy this time the attack had passed off, and he was able to turn his head\nand look at her. He was amazed and moved. What was passing in the heart\nof this avaricious old maid, who for thirty years had been saving up\nher treasure painfully, who had never taken a sou from it, either for\nherself or for any one else? He did not yet comprehend, but he wished to\nshow himself kind and grateful.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a good woman, Martine. All that will be returned to you. I\ntruly think I am going to die--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did not allow him to finish, her whole being rose up in rebellious\nprotest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDie; you, monsieur! Die before me! I do not wish it. I will not let you\ndie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe threw herself on her knees beside the bed; she caught him wildly\nin her arms, feeling him, to see if he suffered, holding him as if she\nthought that death would not dare to take him from her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must tell me what is the matter with you. I will take care of you.\nI will save you. If it were necessary to give my life for you, I would\ngive it, monsieur. I will sit up day and night with you. I am strong\nstill; I will be stronger than the disease, you shall see. To die!\nto die! oh, no, it cannot be! The good God cannot wish so great an\ninjustice. I have prayed so much in my life that he ought to listen to\nme a little now, and he will grant my prayer, monsieur; he will save\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal looked at her, listened to her, and a sudden light broke in upon\nhis mind. She loved him, this miserable woman; she had always loved him.\nHe thought of her thirty years of blind devotion, her mute adoration,\nwhen she had waited upon him, on her knees, as it were, when she\nwas young; her secret jealousy of Clotilde later; what she must have\nsecretly suffered all that time! And she was here on her knees now\nagain, beside his deathbed; her hair gray; her eyes the color of ashes\nin her pale nun-like face, dulled by her solitary life. And he felt that\nshe was unconscious of it all; that she did not even know with what sort\nof love she loved him, loving him only for the happiness of loving him:\nof being with him, and of waiting on him.\n\nTears rose to Pascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes; a dolorous pity and an infinite human\ntenderness flowed from his poor, half-broken heart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy poor girl,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are the best of girls. Come, embrace me,\nas you love me, with all your strength.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe, too, sobbed. She let her gray head, her face worn by her long\nservitude, fall on her master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breast. Wildly she kissed him, putting\nall her life into the kiss.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere, let us not give way to emotion, for you see we can do nothing;\nthis will be the end, just the same. If you wish me to love you, obey\nme. Now that I am better, that I can breathe easier, do me the favor to\nrun to Dr. Ramond\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. Waken him and bring him back with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was leaving the room when he called to her, seized by a sudden fear.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd remember, I forbid you to go to inform my mother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe turned back, embarrassed, and in a voice of entreaty, said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, monsieur, Mme. Felicite has made me promise so often--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut he was inflexible. All his life he had treated his mother with\ndeference, and he thought he had acquired the right to defend himself\nagainst her in the hour of his death. He would not let the servant go\nuntil she had promised him that she would be silent. Then he smiled once\nmore.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo quickly. Oh, you will see me again; it will not be yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDay broke at last, the melancholy dawn of the pale November day. Pascal\nhad had the shutters opened, and when he was left alone he watched the\nbrightening dawn, doubtless that of his last day of life. It had rained\nthe night before, and the mild sun was still veiled by clouds. From the\nplane trees came the morning carols of the birds, while far away in the\nsleeping country a locomotive whistled with a prolonged moan. And he\nwas alone; alone in the great melancholy house, whose emptiness he felt\naround him, whose silence he heard. The light slowly increased, and\nhe watched the patches it made on the window-panes broadening and\nbrightening. Then the candle paled in the growing light, and the whole\nroom became visible. And with the dawn, as he had anticipated, came\nrelief. The sight of the familiar objects around him brought him\nconsolation.\n\nBut Pascal, although the attack had passed away, still suffered\nhorribly. A sharp pain remained in the hollow of his chest, and his left\narm, benumbed, hung from his shoulder like lead. In his long waiting\nfor the help that Martine had gone to bring, he had reflected on\nthe suffering which made the flesh cry out. And he found that he was\nresigned; he no longer felt the rebelliousness which the mere sight of\nphysical pain had formerly awakened in him. It had exasperated him, as\nif it had been a monstrous and useless cruelty of nature. In his doubts\nas a physician, he had attended his patients only to combat it, and to\nrelieve it. If he ended by accepting it, now that he himself suffered\nits horrible torture, was it that he had risen one degree higher in his\nfaith of life, to that serene height whence life appeared altogether\ngood, even with the fatal condition of suffering attached to it;\nsuffering which is perhaps its spring? Yes, to live all of life, to live\nit and to suffer it all without rebellion, without believing that it is\nmade better by being made painless, this presented itself clearly to\nhis dying eyes, as the greatest courage and the greatest wisdom. And to\ncheat pain while he waited, he reviewed his latest theories; he dreamed\nof a means of utilizing suffering by transforming it into action, into\nwork. If it be true that man feels pain more acutely according as he\nrises in the scale of civilization, it is also certain that he becomes\nstronger through it, better armed against it, more capable of resisting\nit. The organ, the brain which works, develops and grows stronger,\nprovided the equilibrium between the sensations which it receives and\nthe work which it gives back be not broken. Might not one hope, then,\nfor a humanity in which the amount of work accomplished would so exactly\nequal the sum of sensations received, that suffering would be utilized\nand, as it were, abolished?\n\nThe sun had risen, and Pascal was confusedly revolving these distant\nhopes in his mind, in the drowsiness produced by his disease, when he\nfelt a new attack coming on. He had a moment of cruel anxiety--was\nthis the end? Was he going to die alone? But at this instant hurried\nfootsteps mounted the stairs, and a moment later Ramond entered,\nfollowed by Martine. And the patient had time to say before the attack\nbegan:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuick! quick! a hypodermic injection of pure water.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nUnfortunately the doctor had to look for the little syringe and then\nto prepare everything. This occupied some minutes, and the attack was\nterrible. He followed its progress with anxiety--the face becoming\ndistorted, the lips growing livid. Then when he had given the injection,\nhe observed that the phenomena, for a moment stationary, slowly\ndiminished in intensity. Once more the catastrophe was averted.\n\nAs soon as he recovered his breath Pascal, glancing at the clock, said\nin his calm, faint voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy friend, it is seven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock--in twelve hours, at seven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock\nto-night, I shall be dead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd as the young man was about to protest, to argue the question, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n he resumed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo not try to deceive me. You have witnessed the attack.\nYou know what it means as well as I do. Everything will now proceed with\nmathematical exactness; and, hour by hour, I could describe to you the\nphases of the disease.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe stopped, gasped for breath, and then added:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then, all is well; I am content. Clotilde will be here at five; all\nI ask is to see her and to die in her arms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA few moments later, however, he experienced a sensible improvement. The\neffect of the injection seemed truly miraculous; and he was able to sit\nup in bed, his back resting against the pillows. He spoke clearly, and\nwith more ease, and never had the lucidity of his mind appeared greater.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know, master,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said, Ramond, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I will not leave you. I have\ntold my wife, and we will spend the day together; and, whatever you may\nsay to the contrary, I am very confident that it will not be the last.\nYou will let me make myself at home, here, will you not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal smiled, and gave orders to Martine to go and prepare breakfast\nfor Ramond, saying that if they needed her they would call her. And the\ntwo men remained alone, conversing with friendly intimacy; the one with\nhis white hair and long white beard, lying down, discoursing like a\nsage, the other sitting at his bedside, listening with the respect of a\ndisciple.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d murmured the master, as if he were speaking to himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe\neffect of those injections is extraordinary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen in a stronger voice, he said almost gaily:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy friend Ramond, it may not be a very great present that I am giving\nyou, but I am going to leave you my manuscripts. Yes, Clotilde has\norders to send them to you when I shall be no more. Look through them,\nand you will perhaps find among them things that are not so very bad. If\nyou get a good idea from them some day--well, that will be so much the\nbetter for the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then he made his scientific testament. He was clearly conscious\nthat he had been himself only a solitary pioneer, a precursor, planning\ntheories which he tried to put in practise, but which failed because\nof the imperfection of his method. He recalled his enthusiasm when he\nbelieved he had discovered, in his injections of nerve substance, the\nuniversal panacea, then his disappointments, his fits of despair, the\nshocking death of Lafouasse, consumption carrying off Valentin in spite\nof all his efforts, madness again conquering Sarteur and causing him to\nhang himself. So that he would depart full of doubt, having no longer\nthe confidence necessary to the physician, and so enamored of life that\nhe had ended by putting all his faith in it, certain that it must draw\nfrom itself alone its health and strength. But he did not wish to close\nup the future; he was glad, on the contrary, to bequeath his hypotheses\nto the younger generation. Every twenty years theories changed;\nestablished truths only, on which science continued to build, remained\nunshaken. Even if he had only the merit of giving to science a momentary\nhypothesis, his work would not be lost, for progress consisted assuredly\nin the effort, in the onward march of the intellect.\n\nAnd then who could say that he had died in vain, troubled and weary, his\nhopes concerning the injections unrealized--other workers would come,\nyoung, ardent, confident, who would take up the idea, elucidate it,\nexpand it. And perhaps a new epoch, a new world would date from this.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, my dear Ramond,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif one could only live life over\nagain. Yes, I would take up my idea again, for I have been struck lately\nby the singular efficacy of injections even of pure water. It is not the\nliquid, then, that matters, but simply the mechanical action. During the\nlast month I have written a great deal on that subject. You will\nfind some curious notes and observations there. In short, I should be\ninclined to put all my faith in work, to place health in the harmonious\nworking of all the organs, a sort of dynamic therapeutics, if I may\nventure to use the expression.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe had gradually grown excited, forgetting his approaching death in his\nardent curiosity about life. And he sketched, with broad strokes, his\nlast theory. Man was surrounded by a medium--nature--which irritated\nby perpetual contact the sensitive extremities of the nerves. Hence the\naction, not only of the senses, but of the entire surface of the body,\nexternal and internal. For it was these sensations which, reverberating\nin the brain, in the marrow, and in the nervous centers, were there\nconverted into tonicity, movements, and thoughts; and he was convinced\nthat health consisted in the natural progress of this work, in receiving\nsensations, and in giving them back in thoughts and in actions, the\nhuman machine being thus fed by the regular play of the organs. Work\nthus became the great law, the regulator of the living universe. Hence\nit became necessary if the equilibrium were broken, if the external\nexcitations ceased to be sufficient, for therapeutics to create\nartificial excitations, in order to reestablish the tonicity which is\nthe state of perfect health. And he dreamed of a whole new system of\ntreatment--suggestion, the all-powerful authority of the physician,\nfor the senses; electricity, friction, massage for the skin and for the\ntendons; diet for the stomach; air cures on high plateaus for the\nlungs, and, finally, transfusion, injections of distilled water, for the\ncirculatory system. It was the undeniable and purely mechanical action\nof these latter that had put him on the track; all he did now was to\nextend the hypothesis, impelled by his generalizing spirit; he saw the\nworld saved anew in this perfect equilibrium, as much work given as\nsensation received, the balance of the world restored by unceasing\nlabor.\n\nHere he burst into a frank laugh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere! I have started off again. I, who was firmly convinced that the\nonly wisdom was not to interfere, to let nature take its course. Ah,\nwhat an incorrigible old fool I am!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRamond caught his hands in an outburst of admiration and affection.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster, master! it is of enthusiasm, of folly like yours that genius is\nmade. Have no fear, I have listened to you, I will endeavor to be worthy\nof the heritage you leave; and I think, with you, that perhaps the great\nfuture lies entirely there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn the sad and quiet room Pascal began to speak again, with the\ncourageous tranquillity of a dying philosopher giving his last lesson.\nHe now reviewed his personal observations; he said that he had often\ncured himself by work, regular and methodical work, not carried to\nexcess. Eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock struck; he urged Ramond to take his breakfast,\nand he continued the conversation, soaring to lofty and distant heights,\nwhile Martine served the meal. The sun had at last burst through the\nmorning mists, a sun still half-veiled in clouds, and mild, whose golden\nlight warmed the room. Presently, after taking a few sips of milk,\nPascal remained silent.\n\nAt this moment the young physician was eating a pear.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you in pain again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no; finish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut he could not deceive Ramond. It was an attack, and a terrible one.\nThe suffocation came with the swiftness of a thunderbolt, and he fell\nback on the pillow, his face already blue. He clutched at the bedclothes\nto support himself, to raise the dreadful weight which oppressed his\nchest. Terrified, livid, he kept his wide open eyes fixed upon the\nclock, with a dreadful expression of despair and grief; and for ten\nminutes it seemed as if every moment must be his last.\n\nRamond had immediately given him a hypodermic injection. The relief was\nslow to come, the efficacy less than before.\n\nWhen Pascal revived, large tears stood in his eyes. He did not speak\nnow, he wept. Presently, looking at the clock with his darkening vision,\nhe said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy friend, I shall die at four o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock; I shall not see her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd as his young colleague, in order to divert his thoughts, declared,\nin spite of appearances, that the end was not so near, Pascal, again\nbecoming enthusiastic, wished to give him a last lesson, based on direct\nobservation. He had, as it happened, attended several cases similar to\nhis own, and he remembered especially to have dissected at the hospital\nthe heart of a poor old man affected with sclerosis.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can see it--my heart. It is the color of a dead leaf; its fibers are\nbrittle, wasted, one would say, although it has augmented slightly in\nvolume. The inflammatory process has hardened it; it would be difficult\nto cut--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe continued in a lower voice. A little before, he had felt his heart\ngrowing weaker, its contractions becoming feebler and slower. Instead\nof the normal jet of blood there now issued from the aorta only a red\nfroth. Back of it all the veins were engorged with black blood; the\nsuffocation increased, according as the lift and force pump, the\nregulator of the whole machine, moved more slowly. And after the\ninjection he had been able to follow in spite of his suffering the\ngradual reviving of the organ as the stimulus set it beating again,\nremoving the black venous blood, and sending life into it anew, with\nthe red arterial blood. But the attack would return as soon as the\nmechanical effect of the injection should cease. He could predict it\nalmost within a few minutes. Thanks to the injections he would have\nthree attacks more. The third would carry him off; he would die at four\no\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.\n\nThen, while his voice grew gradually weaker, in a last outburst of\nenthusiasm, he apostrophized the courage of the heart, that persistent\nlife maker, working ceaselessly, even during sleep, when the other\norgans rested.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, brave heart! how heroically you struggle! What faithful, what\ngenerous muscles, never wearied! You have loved too much, you have beat\ntoo fast in the past months, and that is why you are breaking now,\nbrave heart, who do not wish to die, and who strive rebelliously to beat\nstill!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut now the first of the attacks which had been announced came on.\nPascal came out of this panting, haggard, his speech sibilant and\npainful. Low moans escaped him, in spite of his courage. Good God! would\nthis torture never end? And yet his most ardent desire was to prolong\nhis agony, to live long enough to embrace Clotilde a last time. If he\nmight only be deceiving himself, as Ramond persisted in declaring. If he\nmight only live until five o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock. His eyes again turned to the clock,\nthey never now left the hands, every minute seeming an eternity. They\nmarked three o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock. Then half-past three. Ah, God! only two hours of\nlife, two hours more of life. The sun was already sinking toward the\nhorizon; a great calm descended from the pale winter sky, and he heard\nat intervals the whistles of the distant locomotives crossing the bare\nplain. The train that was passing now was the one going to the Tulettes;\nthe other, the one coming from Marseilles, would it never arrive, then!\n\nAt twenty minutes to four Pascal signed to Ramond to approach. He could\nno longer speak loud enough to be heard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see, in order that I might live until six o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, the pulse should\nbe stronger. I have still some hope, however, but the second movement is\nalmost imperceptible, the heart will soon cease to beat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd in faint, despairing accents he called on Clotilde again and again.\nThe immeasurable grief which he felt at not being able to see her again\nbroke forth in this faltering and agonized appeal. Then his anxiety\nabout his manuscripts returned, an ardent entreaty shone in his eyes,\nuntil at last he found the strength to falter again:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not leave me; the key is under my pillow; tell Clotilde to take it;\nshe has my directions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt ten minutes to four another hypodermic injection was given, but\nwithout effect. And just as four o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock was striking, the second attack\ndeclared itself. Suddenly, after a fit of suffocation, he threw himself\nout of bed; he desired to rise, to walk, in a last revival of his\nstrength. A need of space, of light, of air, urged him toward the skies.\nThen there came to him an irresistible appeal from life, his whole life,\nfrom the adjoining workroom, where he had spent his days. And he went\nthere, staggering, suffocating, bending to the left side, supporting\nhimself by the furniture.\n\nDr. Ramond precipitated himself quickly toward him to stop him, crying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster, master! lie down again, I entreat you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Pascal paid no heed to him, obstinately determined to die on his\nfeet. The desire to live, the heroic idea of work, alone survived in\nhim, carrying him onward bodily. He faltered hoarsely:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no--out there, out there--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis friend was obliged to support him, and he walked thus, stumbling and\nhaggard, to the end of the workroom, and dropped into his chair beside\nhis table, on which an unfinished page still lay among a confusion of\npapers and books.\n\nHere he gasped for breath and his eyes closed. After a moment he opened\nthem again, while his hands groped about, seeking his work, no doubt.\nThey encountered the genealogical tree in the midst of other papers\nscattered about. Only two days before he had corrected some dates in it.\nHe recognized it, and drawing it toward him, spread it out.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster, master! you will kill yourself!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Ramond, overcome with\npity and admiration at this extraordinary spectacle.\n\nPascal did not listen, did not hear. He felt a pencil under his fingers.\nHe took it and bent over the tree, as if his dying eyes no longer saw.\nThe name of Maxime arrested his attention, and he wrote: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDied of ataxia\nin 1873,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the certainty that his nephew would not live through the\nyear. Then Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name, beside it, struck him and he completed the\nnote thus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHas a son, by her Uncle Pascal, in 1874.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But it was his own\nname that he sought wearily and confusedly. When he at last found it\nhis hand grew firmer, and he finished his note, in upright and bold\ncharacters: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDied of heart disease, November 7, 1873.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This was the\nsupreme effort, the rattle in his throat increased, everything was\nfading into nothingness, when he perceived the blank leaf above\nClotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name. His vision grew dark, his fingers could no longer hold\nthe pencil, but he was still able to add, in unsteady letters, into\nwhich passed the tortured tenderness, the wild disorder of his poor\nheart: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe unknown child, to be born in 1874. What will it be?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then he\nswooned, and Martine and Ramond with difficulty carried him back to bed.\n\nThe third attack came on about four o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock. In this last access of\nsuffocation Pascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s countenance expressed excruciating suffering. Death\nwas to be very painful; he must endure to the end his martyrdom, as a\nman and a scientist. His wandering gaze still seemed to seek the clock,\nto ascertain the hour. And Ramond, seeing his lips move, bent down and\nplaced his ear to the mouth of the dying man. The latter, in effect, was\nstammering some vague words, so faint that they scarcely rose above a\nbreath:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFour o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock--the heart is stopping; no more red blood in the\naorta--the valve relaxes and bursts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA dreadful spasm shook him; his breathing grew fainter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIts progress is too rapid. Do not leave me; the key is under the\npillow--Clotilde, Clotilde--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt the foot of the bed Martine was kneeling, choked with sobs. She\nsaw well that monsieur was dying. She had not dared to go for a priest\nnotwithstanding her great desire to do so; and she was herself reciting\nthe prayers for the dying; she prayed ardently that God would pardon\nmonsieur, and that monsieur might go straight to Paradise.\n\nPascal was dying. His face was quite blue. After a few seconds of\nimmobility, he tried to breathe: he put out his lips, opened his poor\nmouth, like a little bird opening its beak to get a last mouthful of\nair. And he was dead.\n\n\n\n\nXIII.\n\nIt was not until after breakfast, at about one o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, that Clotilde\nreceived the despatch. On this day it had chanced that she had quarreled\nwith her brother Maxime, who, taking advantage of his privileges as an\ninvalid, had tormented her more and more every day by his unreasonable\ncaprices and his outbursts of ill temper. In short, her visit to him had\nnot proved a success. He found that she was too simple and too serious\nto cheer him; and he had preferred, of late, the society of Rose, the\nfair-haired young girl, with the innocent look, who amused him. So that\nwhen his sister told him that their uncle had sent for her, and that she\nwas going away, he gave his approval at once, and although he asked her\nto return as soon as she should have settled her affairs at home, he did\nso only with the desire of showing himself amiable, and he did not press\nthe invitation.\n\nClotilde spent the afternoon in packing her trunks. In the feverish\nexcitement of so sudden a decision she had thought of nothing but the\njoy of her return. But after the hurry of dinner was over, after she had\nsaid good-by to her brother, after the interminable drive in a hackney\ncoach along the avenue of the Bois de Boulogne to the Lyons railway\nstation, when she found herself in the ladies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compartment, starting\non the long journey on a cold and rainy November night, already rolling\naway from Paris, her excitement began to abate, and reflections forced\ntheir way into her mind and began to trouble her. Why this brief and\nurgent despatch: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI await you; start this evening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Doubtless it was the\nanswer to her letter; but she knew how greatly Pascal had desired that\nshe should remain in Paris, where he thought she was happy, and she was\nastonished at his hasty summons. She had not expected a despatch, but\na letter, arranging for her return a few weeks later. There must be\nsomething else, then; perhaps he was ill and felt a desire, a longing to\nsee her again at once. And from this time forward this fear seized her\nwith the force of a presentiment, and grew stronger and stronger, until\nit soon took complete possession of her.\n\nAll night long the rain beat furiously against the windows of the train\nwhile they were crossing the plains of Burgundy, and did not cease until\nthey reached Macon. When they had passed Lyons the day broke. Clotilde\nhad Pascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letters with her, and she had waited impatiently for the\ndaylight that she might read again carefully these letters, the\nwriting of which had seemed changed to her. And noticing the unsteady\ncharacters, the breaks in the words, she felt a chill at her heart. He\nwas ill, very ill--she had become certain of this now, by a divination\nin which there was less of reasoning than of subtle prescience. And the\nrest of the journey seemed terribly long, for her anguish increased\nin proportion as she approached its termination. And worse than all,\narriving at Marseilles at half-past twelve, there was no train for\nPlassans until twenty minutes past three. Three long hours of waiting!\nShe breakfasted at the buffet in the railway station, eating hurriedly,\nas if she was afraid of missing this train; then she dragged herself\ninto the dusty garden, going from bench to bench in the pale, mild\nsunshine, among omnibuses and hackney coaches. At last she was once more\nin the train, which stopped at every little way station. When they were\napproaching Plassans she put her head out of the window eagerly, longing\nto see the town again after her short absence of two months. It seemed\nto her as if she had been away for twenty years, and that everything\nmust be changed. When the train was leaving the little station of\nSainte-Marthe her emotion reached its height when, leaning out, she\nsaw in the distance La Souleiade with the two secular cypresses on the\nterrace, which could be seen three leagues off.\n\nIt was five o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, and twilight was already falling. The train\nstopped, and Clotilde descended. But it was a surprise and a keen grief\nto her not to see Pascal waiting for her on the platform. She had been\nsaying to herself since they had left Lyons: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I do not see him at\nonce, on the arrival of the train, it will be because he is ill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He\nmight be in the waiting-room, however, or with a carriage outside. She\nhurried forward, but she saw no one but Father Durieu, a driver whom the\ndoctor was in the habit of employing. She questioned him eagerly. The\nold man, a taciturn Provencal, was in no haste to answer. His wagon was\nthere, and he asked her for the checks for her luggage, wishing to see\nabout the trunks before anything else. In a trembling voice she repeated\nher question:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs everybody well, Father Durieu?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, mademoiselle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she was obliged to put question after question to him before she\nsucceeded in eliciting the information that it was Martine who had told\nhim, at about six o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock the day before, to be at the station with his\nwagon, in time to meet the train. He had not seen the doctor, no one had\nseen him, for two months past. It might very well be since he was not\nhere that he had been obliged to take to his bed, for there was a report\nin the town that he was not very well.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWait until I get the luggage, mademoiselle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he ended, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is room\nfor you on the seat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, Father Durieu, it would be too long to wait. I will walk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe ascended the slope rapidly. Her heart was so tightened that\nshe could scarcely breathe. The sun had sunk behind the hills of\nSainte-Marthe, and a fine mist was falling from the chill gray November\nsky, and as she took the road to Les Fenouilleres she caught another\nglimpse of La Souleiade, which struck a chill to her heart--the front\nof the house, with all its shutters closed, and wearing a look of\nabandonment and desolation in the melancholy twilight.\n\nBut Clotilde received the final and terrible blow when she saw Ramond\nstanding at the hall door, apparently waiting for her. He had indeed\nbeen watching for her, and had come downstairs to break the dreadful\nnews gently to her. She arrived out of breath; she had crossed the\nquincunx of plane trees near the fountain to shorten the way, and on\nseeing the young man there instead of Pascal, whom she had in spite of\neverything expected to see, she had a presentiment of overwhelming ruin,\nof irreparable misfortune. Ramond was pale and agitated, notwithstanding\nthe effort he made to control his feelings. At the first moment he could\nnot find a word to say, but waited to be questioned. Clotilde, who was\nherself suffocating, said nothing. And they entered the house thus; he\nled her to the dining-room, where they remained for a few seconds, face\nto face, in mute anguish.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is ill, is he not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she at last faltered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009che is ill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew it at once when I saw you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew when he was not\nhere that he must be ill. He is very ill, is he not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she persisted.\n\nAs he did not answer but grew still paler, she looked at him fixedly.\nAnd on the instant she saw the shadow of death upon him; on his hands\nthat still trembled, that had assisted the dying man; on his sad face;\nin his troubled eyes, which still retained the reflection of the death\nagony; in the neglected and disordered appearance of the physician who,\nfor twelve hours, had maintained an unavailing struggle against death.\n\nShe gave a loud cry:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is dead!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe tottered, and fell fainting into the arms of Ramond, who with a\ngreat sob pressed her in a brotherly embrace. And thus they wept on each\nother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck.\n\nWhen he had seated her in a chair, and she was able to speak, he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was I who took the despatch you received to the telegraph office\nyesterday, at half-past ten o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock. He was so happy, so full of hope!\nHe was forming plans for the future--a year, two years of life. And this\nmorning, at four o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, he had the first attack, and he sent for me.\nHe saw at once that he was doomed, but he expected to last until\nsix o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, to live long enough to see you again. But the disease\nprogressed too rapidly. He described its progress to me, minute by\nminute, like a professor in the dissecting room. He died with your name\nupon his lips, calm, but full of anguish, like a hero.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde listened, her eyes drowned in tears which flowed endlessly.\nEvery word of the relation of this piteous and stoical death penetrated\nher heart and stamped itself there. She reconstructed every hour of the\ndreadful day. She followed to its close its grand and mournful drama.\nShe would live it over in her thoughts forever.\n\nBut her despairing grief overflowed when Martine, who had entered the\nroom a moment before, said in a harsh voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, mademoiselle has good reason to cry! for if monsieur is dead,\nmademoiselle is to blame for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old servant stood apart, near the door of her kitchen, in such a\npassion of angry grief, because they had taken her master from her,\nbecause they had killed him, that she did not even try to find a word\nof welcome or consolation for this child whom she had brought up. And\nwithout calculating the consequences of her indiscretion, the grief or\nthe joy which she might cause, she relieved herself by telling all she\nknew.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, if monsieur has died, it is because mademoiselle went away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFrom the depths of her overpowering grief Clotilde protested. She had\nexpected to see Martine weeping with her, like Ramond, and she was\nsurprised to feel that she was an enemy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, it was he who would not let me stay, who insisted upon my going\naway,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, well! mademoiselle must have been willing to go or she would\nhave been more clear-sighted. The night before your departure I found\nmonsieur half-suffocated with grief; and when I wished to inform\nmademoiselle, he himself prevented me; he had such courage. Then I could\nsee it all, after mademoiselle had gone. Every night it was the same\nthing over again, and he could hardly keep from writing to you to come\nback. In short, he died of it, that is the pure truth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA great light broke in on Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind, making her at the same time\nvery happy and very wretched. Good God! what she had suspected for a\nmoment, was then true. Afterward she had been convinced, seeing Pascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nangry persistence, that he was speaking the truth; that between her and\nwork he had chosen work sincerely, like a man of science with whom love\nof work has gained the victory over the love of woman. And yet he\nhad not spoken the truth; he had carried his devotion, his\nself-forgetfulness to the point of immolating himself to what he\nbelieved to be her happiness. And the misery of things willed that he\nshould have been mistaken, that he should have thus consummated the\nunhappiness of both.\n\nClotilde again protested wildly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut how could I have known? I obeyed; I put all my love in my\nobedience.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Martine again, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit seems to me that I should have guessed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRamond interposed gently. He took Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands once more in his, and\nexplained to her that grief might indeed have hastened the fatal issue,\nbut that the master had unhappily been doomed for some time past. The\naffection of the heart from which he had suffered must have been of long\nstanding--a great deal of overwork, a certain part of heredity, and,\nfinally, his late absorbing love, and the poor heart had broken.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us go upstairs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Clotilde simply. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish to see him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nUpstairs in the death-chamber the blinds were closed, shutting out even\nthe melancholy twilight. On a little table at the foot of the bed burned\ntwo tapers in two candlesticks. And they cast a pale yellow light on\nPascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s form extended on the bed, the feet close together, the hands\nfolded on the breast. The eyes had been piously closed. The face, of a\nbluish hue still, but already looking calm and peaceful, framed by the\nflowing white hair and beard, seemed asleep. He had been dead scarcely\nan hour and a half, yet already infinite serenity, eternal silence,\neternal repose, had begun.\n\nSeeing him thus, at the thought that he no longer heard her, that he no\nlonger saw her, that she was alone now, that she was to kiss him for the\nlast time, and then lose him forever, Clotilde, in an outburst of\ngrief, threw herself upon the bed, and in broken accents of passionate\ntenderness cried:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, master, master, master--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe pressed her lips to the dead man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forehead, and, feeling it still\nwarm with life, she had a momentary illusion: she fancied that he\nfelt this last caress, so cruelly awaited. Did he not smile in his\nimmobility, happy at last, and able to die, now that he felt her here\nbeside him? Then, overcome by the dreadful reality, she burst again into\nwild sobs.\n\nMartine entered, bringing a lamp, which she placed on a corner of\nthe chimney-piece, and she heard Ramond, who was watching Clotilde,\ndisquieted at seeing her passionate grief, say:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall take you away from the room if you give way like this. Consider\nthat you have some one else to think of now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe servant had been surprised at certain words which she had overheard\nby chance during the day. Suddenly she understood, and she turned paler\neven than before, and on her way out of the room, she stopped at the\ndoor to hear more.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe key of the press is under his pillow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ramond, lowering his\nvoice; \u00e2\u0080\u009che told me repeatedly to tell you so. You know what you have to\ndo?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde made an effort to remember and to answer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I have to do? About the papers, is it not? Yes, yes, I remember; I\nam to keep the envelopes and to give you the other manuscripts. Have no\nfear, I am quite calm, I will be very reasonable. But I will not leave\nhim; I will spend the night here very quietly, I promise you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was so unhappy, she seemed so resolved to watch by him, to remain\nwith him, until he should be taken away, that the young physician\nallowed her to have her way.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I will leave you now. They will be expecting me at home. Then\nthere are all sorts of formalities to be gone through--to give notice\nat the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office, the funeral, of which I wish to spare you the\ndetails. Trouble yourself about nothing. Everything will be arranged\nto-morrow when I return.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe embraced her once more and then went away. And it was only then that\nMartine left the room, behind him, and locking the hall door she ran out\ninto the darkness.\n\nClotilde was now alone in the chamber; and all around and about her, in\nthe unbroken silence, she felt the emptiness of the house. Clotilde was\nalone with the dead Pascal. She placed a chair at the head of the bed\nand sat there motionless, alone. On arriving, she had merely removed her\nhat: now, perceiving that she still had on her gloves, she took them\noff also. But she kept on her traveling dress, crumpled and dusty, after\ntwenty hours of railway travel. No doubt Father Durieu had brought the\ntrunks long ago, and left them downstairs. But it did not occur to her,\nnor had she the strength to wash herself and change her clothes, but\nremained sitting, overwhelmed with grief, on the chair into which she\nhad dropped. One regret, a great remorse, filled her to the exclusion of\nall else. Why had she obeyed him? Why had she consented to leave him?\nIf she had remained she had the ardent conviction that he would not have\ndied. She would have lavished so much love, so many caresses upon him,\nthat she would have cured him. If one was anxious to keep a beloved\nbeing from dying one should remain with him and, if necessary, give\none\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood to keep him alive. It was her own fault if she had\nlost him, if she could not now with a caress awaken him from his\neternal sleep. And she thought herself imbecile not to have understood;\ncowardly, not to have devoted herself to him; culpable, and to be\nforever punished for having gone away when plain common sense, in\ndefault of feeling, ought to have kept her here, bound, as a submissive\nand affectionate subject, to the task of watching over her king.\n\nThe silence had become so complete, so profound, that Clotilde lifted\nher eyes for a moment from Pascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face to look around the room. She\nsaw only vague shadows--the two tapers threw two yellow patches on the\nhigh ceiling. At this moment she remembered the letters he had written\nto her, so short, so cold; and she comprehended his heroic sacrifice,\nthe torture it had been to him to silence his heart, desiring to\nimmolate himself to the end. What strength must he not have required\nfor the accomplishment of the plan of happiness, sublime and disastrous,\nwhich he had formed for her. He had resolved to pass out of her life in\norder to save her from his old age and his poverty; he wished her to be\nrich and free, to enjoy her youth, far away from him; this indeed was\nutter self-effacement, complete absorption in the love of another. And\nshe felt a profound gratitude, a sweet solace in the thought, mingled\nwith a sort of angry bitterness against evil fortune. Then, suddenly,\nthe happy years of her childhood and her long youth spent beside him who\nhad always been so kind and so good-humored, rose before her--how he had\ngradually won her affection, how she had felt that she was his, after\nthe quarrels which had separated them for a time, and with what a\ntransport of joy she had at last given herself to him.\n\nSeven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock struck. Clotilde started as the clear tones broke the\nprofound silence. Who was it that had spoken? Then she remembered, and\nshe looked at the clock. And when the last sound of the seven strokes,\neach of which had fallen like a knell upon her heart, had died away, she\nturned her eyes again on the motionless face of Pascal, and once more\nshe abandoned herself to her grief.\n\nIt was in the midst of this ever-increasing prostration that Clotilde, a\nfew minutes later, heard a sudden sound of sobbing. Some one had rushed\ninto the room; she looked round and saw her Grandmother Felicite. But\nshe did not stir, she did not speak, so benumbed was she with grief.\nMartine, anticipating the orders which Clotilde would undoubtedly have\ngiven her, had hurried to old Mme. Rougon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, to give her the dreadful\nnews; and the latter, dazed at first by the suddenness of the\ncatastrophe, and afterward greatly agitated, had hurried to the house,\noverflowing with noisy grief. She burst into tears at sight of her son,\nand then embraced Clotilde, who returned her kiss, as in a dream. And\nfrom this instant the latter, without emerging from the overwhelming\ngrief in which she isolated herself, felt that she was no longer alone,\nhearing a continual stir and bustle going on around her. It was Felicite\ncrying, coming in and going out on tiptoe, setting things in order,\nspying about, whispering, dropping into a chair, to get up again a\nmoment afterward, after saying that she was going to die in it. At nine\no\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock she made a last effort to persuade her granddaughter to eat\nsomething. Twice already she had lectured her in a low voice; she came\nnow again to whisper to her:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cClotilde, my dear, I assure you you are wrong. You must keep up your\nstrength or you will never be able to hold out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the young woman, with a shake of her head, again refused.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, you breakfasted at the buffet at Marseilles, I suppose, but you\nhave eaten nothing since. Is that reasonable? I do not wish you to fall\nill also. Martine has some broth. I have told her to make a light soup\nand to roast a chicken. Go down and eat a mouthful, only a mouthful, and\nI will remain here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith the same patient gesture Clotilde again refused. At last she\nfaltered:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not ask me, grandmother, I entreat you. I could not; it would choke\nme.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did not speak again, falling back into her former state of apathy.\nShe did not sleep, however, her wide open eyes were fixed persistently\non Pascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. For hours she sat there, motionless, erect, rigid, as\nif her spirit were far away with the dead. At ten o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock she heard a\nnoise; it was Martine bringing up the lamp. Toward eleven Felicite, who\nwas sitting watching in an armchair, seemed to grow restless, got up and\nwent out of the room, and came back again. From this forth there was a\ncontinual coming and going as of impatient footsteps prowling around\nthe young woman, who was still awake, her large eyes fixed motionless on\nPascal. Twelve o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock struck, and one persistent thought alone pierced\nher weary brain, like a nail, and prevented sleep--why had she obeyed\nhim? If she had remained she would have revived him with her youth, and\nhe would not have died. And it was not until a little before one\nthat she felt this thought, too, grow confused and lose itself in a\nnightmare. And she fell into a heavy sleep, worn out with grief and\nfatigue.\n\nWhen Martine had announced to Mme. Rougon the unexpected death of her\nson Pascal, in the shock which she received there was as much of anger\nas of grief. What! her dying son had not wished to see her; he had made\nthis servant swear not to inform her of his illness! This thought sent\nthe blood coursing swiftly through her veins, as if the struggle between\nthem, which had lasted during his whole life, was to be continued beyond\nthe grave. Then, when after hastily dressing herself she had hurried\nto La Souleiade, the thought of the terrible envelopes, of all the\nmanuscripts piled up in the press, had filled her with trembling rage.\nNow that Uncle Macquart and Aunt Dide were dead, she no longer feared\nwhat she called the abomination of the Tulettes; and even poor little\nCharles, in dying, had carried with him one of the most humiliating\nof the blots on the family. There remained only the envelopes, the\nabominable envelopes, to menace the glorious Rougon legend which she had\nspent her whole life in creating, which was the sole thought of her old\nage, the work to the triumph of which she had persistently devoted\nthe last efforts of her wily and active brain. For long years she had\nwatched these envelopes, never wearying, beginning the struggle over\nagain, when he had thought her beaten, always alert and persistent. Ah!\nif she could only succeed in obtaining possession of them and destroying\nthem! It would be the execrable past destroyed, effaced; it would be the\nglory of her family, so hardly won, at last freed from all fear, at last\nshining untarnished, imposing its lie upon history. And she saw herself\ntraversing the three quarters of Plassans, saluted by every one, bearing\nherself as proudly as a queen, mourning nobly for the fallen Empire. So\nthat when Martine informed her that Clotilde had come, she quickened her\nsteps as she approached La Souleiade, spurred by the fear of arriving\ntoo late.\n\nBut as soon as she was installed in the house, Felicite at once regained\nher composure. There was no hurry, they had the whole night before them.\nShe wished, however, to win over Martine without delay, and she knew\nwell how to influence this simple creature, bound up in the doctrines of\na narrow religion. Going down to the kitchen, then, to see the chicken\nroasting, she began by affecting to be heartbroken at the thought of her\nson dying without having made his peace with the Church. She questioned\nthe servant, pressing her for particulars. But the latter shook her head\ndisconsolately--no, no priest had come, monsieur had not even made the\nsign of the cross. She, only, had knelt down to say the prayers for the\ndying, which certainly could not be enough for the salvation of a soul.\nAnd yet with what fervor she had prayed to the good God that monsieur\nmight go straight to Paradise!\n\nWith her eyes fixed on the chicken turning on the spit, before a bright\nfire, Felicite resumed in a lower voice, with an absorbed air:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, my poor girl, what will most prevent him from going to Paradise are\nthe abominable papers which the unhappy man has left behind him up there\nin the press. I cannot understand why it is that lightning from heaven\nhas not struck those papers before this and reduced them to ashes. If\nthey are allowed to leave this house it will be ruin and disgrace and\neternal perdition!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMartine listened, very pale.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen madame thinks it would be a good work to destroy them, a work that\nwould assure the repose of monsieur\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soul?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGreat God! Do I believe it! Why, if I had those dreadful papers in my\nhands, I would throw every one of them into the fire. Oh, you would not\nneed then to put on any more sticks; with the manuscripts upstairs alone\nyou would have fuel enough to roast three chickens like that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe servant took a long spoon and began to baste the fowl. She, too,\nseemed now to reflect.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got them. I even overheard some words on the subject,\nwhich I may repeat to madame. It was when mademoiselle went upstairs.\nDr. Raymond spoke to her about the papers, asking her if she remembered\nsome orders which she had received, before she went away, no doubt; and\nshe answered that she remembered, that she was to keep the envelopes and\nto give him all the other manuscripts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite trembled; she could not restrain a terrified movement. Already\nshe saw the papers slipping out of her reach; and it was not the\nenvelopes only which she desired, but all the manuscripts, all that\nunknown, suspicious, and secret work, from which nothing but scandal\ncould come, according to the obtuse and excitable mind of the proud old\n_bourgeoise_.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we must act!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cact immediately, this very night!\nTo-morrow it may be too late.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know where the key of the press is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Martine in a low voice.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe doctor told mademoiselle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite immediately pricked up her ears.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe key; where is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder the pillow, under monsieur\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn spite of the bright blaze of the fire of vine branches the air seemed\nto grow suddenly chill, and the two old women were silent. The only\nsound to be heard was the drip of the chicken juice falling into the\npan.\n\nBut after Mme. Rougon had eaten a hasty and solitary dinner she went\nupstairs again with Martine. Without another word being spoken they\nunderstood each other, it was decided that they would use all possible\nmeans to obtain possession of the papers before daybreak. The simplest\nwas to take the key from under the pillow. Clotilde would no doubt at\nlast fall asleep--she seemed too exhausted not to succumb to fatigue.\nAll they had to do was to wait. They set themselves to watch, then,\ngoing back and forth on tiptoe between the study and the bedroom,\nwaiting for the moment when the young woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s large motionless eyes\nshould close in sleep. One of them would go to see, while the other\nwaited impatiently in the study, where a lamp burned dully on the table.\nThis was repeated every fifteen minutes until midnight. The fathomless\neyes, full of gloom and of an immense despair, did not close. A little\nbefore midnight Felicite installed herself in an armchair at the foot of\nthe bed, resolved not to leave the spot until her granddaughter should\nhave fallen asleep. From this forth she did not take her eyes off\nClotilde, and it filled her with a sort of fear to remark that the girl\nscarcely moved her eyelids, looking with that inconsolable fixity which\ndefies sleep. Then she herself began to feel sleep stealing over her.\nExasperated, trembling with nervous impatience, she could remain where\nshe was no longer. And she went to rejoin the servant, who was watching\nin the study.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is useless; she will not sleep,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in a stifled and trembling\nvoice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must find some other way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt had indeed occurred to her to break open the press.\n\nBut the old oaken boards were strong, the old iron held firmly. How\ncould they break the lock--not to speak of the noise they would make and\nwhich would certainly be heard in the adjoining room?\n\nShe stood before the thick doors, however, and felt them with her\nfingers, seeking some weak spot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I only had an instrument,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\nMartine, less eager, interrupted her, objecting: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no, no, madame!\nWe might be surprised! Wait, I will go again and see if mademoiselle is\nasleep now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe went to the bedroom on tiptoe and returned immediately, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, she is asleep. Her eyes are closed, and she does not stir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen both went to look at her, holding their breath and walking with the\nutmost caution, so that the boards might not creak. Clotilde had indeed\njust fallen asleep: and her stupor seemed so profound that the two old\nwomen grew bold. They feared, however, that they might touch and waken\nher, for her chair stood close beside the bed. And then, to put\none\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand under a dead man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pillow to rob him was a terrible and\nsacrilegious act, the thought of which filled them with terror. Might it\nnot disturb his repose? Might he not move at the shock? The thought made\nthem turn pale.\n\nFelicite had advanced with outstretched hand, but she drew back,\nstammering:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am too short. You try, Martine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe servant in her turn approached the bed. But she was seized with such\na fit of trembling that she was obliged to retreat lest she should fall.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, I cannot!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seems to me that monsieur is going to\nopen his eyes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd trembling and awe-struck they remained an instant longer in the\nlugubrious chamber full of the silence and the majesty of death, facing\nPascal, motionless forever, and Clotilde, overwhelmed by the grief of\nher widowhood. Perhaps they saw, glorifying that mute head, guarding\nits work with all its weight, the nobility of a life spent in honorable\nlabor. The flame of the tapers burned palely. A sacred awe filled the\nair, driving them from the chamber.\n\nFelicite, who was so brave, who had never in her life flinched from\nanything, not even from bloodshed, fled as if she was pursued, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, come, Martine, we will find some other way; we will go look for\nan instrument.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn the study they drew a breath of relief. Felicite looked in vain among\nthe papers on Pascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work-table for the genealogical tree, which\nshe knew was usually there. She would so gladly have begun her work of\ndestruction with this. It was there, but in her feverish excitement she\ndid not perceive it.\n\nHer desire drew her back again to the press, and she stood before it,\nmeasuring it and examining it with eager and covetous look. In spite of\nher short stature, in spite of her eighty-odd years, she displayed an\nactivity and an energy that were truly extraordinary.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she repeated, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I only had an instrument!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she again sought the crevice in the colossus, the crack into which\nshe might introduce her fingers, to break it open. She imagined plans\nof assault, she thought of using force, and then she fell back on\nstratagem, on some piece of treachery which would open to her the doors,\nmerely by breathing upon them.\n\nSuddenly her glance kindled; she had discovered the means.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me, Martine; there is a hook fastening one of the doors, is there\nnot?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, madame; it catches in a ring above the middle shelf. See, it is\nabout the height of this molding.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite made a triumphant gesture.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you a gimlet--a large gimlet? Give me a gimlet!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMartine went down into her kitchen and brought back the tool that had\nbeen asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn that way, you see, we shall make no noise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed the old woman,\nsetting herself to her task.\n\nWith a strength which one would not have suspected in her little hands,\nwithered by age, she inserted the gimlet, and made a hole at the height\nindicated by the servant. But it was too low; she felt the point, after\na time, entering the shelf. A second attempt brought the instrument in\ndirect contact with the iron hook. This time the hole was too near. And\nshe multiplied the holes to right and left, until finally she succeeded\nin pushing the hook out of the ring. The bolt of the lock slipped, and\nboth doors opened.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt last!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Felicite, beside herself.\n\nThen she remained motionless for a moment, her ear turned uneasily\ntoward the bedroom, fearing that she had wakened Clotilde. But silence\nreigned throughout the dark and sleeping house. There came from the\nbedroom only the august peace of death; she heard nothing but the clear\nvibration of the clock; Clotilde fell asleep near one. And the press\nyawned wide open, displaying the papers with which it overflowed, heaped\nup on its three shelves. Then she threw herself upon it, and the work of\ndestruction began, in the midst of the sacred obscurity of the infinite\nrepose of this funereal vigil.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt last!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she repeated, in a low voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cafter thirty years of waiting.\nLet us hurry--let us hurry. Martine, help me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe had already drawn forward the high chair of the desk, and mounted on\nit at a bound, to take down, first of all, the papers on the top shelf,\nfor she remembered that the envelopes were there. But she was surprised\nnot to see the thick blue paper wrappers; there was nothing there but\nbulky manuscripts, the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s completed but unpublished works, works\nof inestimable value, all his researches, all his discoveries, the\nmonument of his future fame, which he had left in Ramond\u00e2\u0080\u0099s charge.\nDoubtless, some days before his death, thinking that only the envelopes\nwere in danger, and that no one in the world would be so daring as to\ndestroy his other works, he had begun to classify and arrange the papers\nanew, and removed the envelopes out of sight.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, so much the worse!\u00e2\u0080\u009d murmured Felicite; \u00e2\u0080\u009clet us begin anywhere;\nthere are so many of them that if we wish to get through we must\nhurry. While I am up here, let us clear these away forever. Here, catch\nMartine!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she emptied the shelf, throwing the manuscripts, one by one, into\nthe arms of the servant, who laid them on the table with as little noise\nas possible. Soon the whole heap was on it, and Felicite sprang down\nfrom the chair.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo the fire! to the fire! We shall lay our hands on the others,\nand too, by and by, on those I am looking for. These can go into it,\nmeantime. It will be a good riddance, at any rate, a fine clearance,\nyes, indeed! To the fire, to the fire with them all, even to the\nsmallest scrap of paper, even to the most illegible scrawl, if we wish\nto be certain of destroying the contamination of evil.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe herself, fanatical and fierce, in her hatred of the truth, in her\neagerness to destroy the testimony of science, tore off the first page\nof one of the manuscripts, lighted it at the lamp, and then threw this\nburning brand into the great fireplace, in which there had not been a\nfire for perhaps twenty years, and she fed the fire, continuing to\nthrow on it the rest of the manuscript, piece by piece. The servant, as\ndetermined as herself, came to her assistance, taking another enormous\nnotebook, which she tore up leaf by leaf. From this forth the fire did\nnot cease to burn, filling the wide fireplace with a bright blaze, with\ntongues of flame that seemed to die away from time to time, only to\nburn up more brightly than ever when fresh fuel fed them. The fire\ngrew larger, the heap of ashes rose higher and higher--a thick bed of\nblackened leaves among which ran millions of sparks. But it was a long,\na never-ending task; for when several pages were thrown on at a time,\nthey would not burn; it was necessary to move them and turn them over\nwith the tongs; the best way was to stir them up and then wait until\nthey were in a blaze, before adding more. The women soon grew skilful at\ntheir task, and the work progressed at a rapid rate.\n\nIn her haste to get a fresh armful of papers Felicite stumbled against a\nchair.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, madame, take care,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Martine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome one might come!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome? who should come? Clotilde? She is too sound asleep, poor girl.\nAnd even if any one should come, once it is finished, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care;\nI won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hide myself, you may be sure; I shall leave the empty press\nstanding wide open; I shall say aloud that it is I who have purified\nthe house. When there is not a line of writing left, ah, good heavens! I\nshall laugh at everything else!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor almost two hours the fireplace blazed. They went back to the press\nand emptied the two other shelves, and now there remained only the\nbottom, which was heaped with a confusion of papers. Little by little,\nintoxicated by the heat of the bonfire, out of breath and perspiring,\nthey gave themselves up to the savage joy of destruction. They stooped\ndown, they blackened their hands, pushing in the partially consumed\nfragments, with gestures so violent, so feverishly excited, that their\ngray locks fell in disorder over their shoulders. It was like a dance of\nwitches, feeding a hellish fire for some abominable act--the martyrdom\nof a saint, the burning of written thought in the public square; a whole\nworld of truth and hope destroyed. And the blaze of this fire, which\nat moments made the flame of the lamp grow pale, lighted up the vast\napartment, and made the gigantic shadows of the two women dance upon the\nceiling.\n\nBut as she was emptying the bottom of the press, after having burned,\nhandful by handful, the papers with which it had been filled, Felicite\nuttered a stifled cry of triumph.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, here they are! To the fire! to the fire!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe had at last come upon the envelopes. Far back, behind the rampart\nformed by the notes, the doctor had hidden the blue paper wrappers. And\nthen began a mad work of havoc, a fury of destruction; the envelopes\nwere gathered up in handfuls and thrown into the flames, filling the\nfireplace with a roar like that of a conflagration.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are burning, they are burning! They are burning at last! Here\nis another, Martine, here is another. Ah, what a fire, what a glorious\nfire!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the servant was becoming uneasy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake care, madame, you are going to set the house on fire. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you\nhear that roar?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! what does that matter? Let it all burn. They are burning, they are\nburning; what a fine sight! Three more, two more, and, see, now the last\nis burning!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe laughed with delight, beside herself, terrible to see, when some\nfragment of lighted soot fell down. The roar was becoming more and more\nfierce; the chimney, which was never swept, had caught fire. This seemed\nto excite her still more, while the servant, losing her head, began to\nscream and run about the room.\n\nClotilde slept beside the dead Pascal, in the supreme calm of the\nbedroom, unbroken save by the light vibration of the clock striking\nthe hours. The tapers burned with a tall, still flame, the air was\nmotionless. And yet, in the midst of her heavy, dreamless sleep, she\nheard, as in a nightmare, a tumult, an ever-increasing rush and roar.\nAnd when she opened her eyes she could not at first understand. Where\nwas she? Why this enormous weight that crushed her heart? She came back\nto reality with a start of terror--she saw Pascal, she heard Martine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncries in the adjoining room, and she rushed out, in alarm, to learn\ntheir cause.\n\nBut at the threshold Clotilde took in the whole scene with cruel\ndistinctness--the press wide open and completely empty; Martine maddened\nby her fear of fire; Felicite radiant, pushing into the flames with her\nfoot the last fragments of the envelopes. Smoke and flying soot filled\nthe study, where the roaring of the fire sounded like the hoarse gasping\nof a murdered man--the fierce roar which she had just heard in her\nsleep.\n\nAnd the cry which sprang from her lips was the same cry that Pascal\nhimself had uttered on the night of the storm, when he surprised her in\nthe act of stealing his papers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThieves! assassins!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe precipitated herself toward the fireplace, and, in spite of the\ndreadful roaring of the flames, in spite of the falling pieces of soot,\nat the risk of setting her hair on fire, and of burning her hands,\nshe gathered up the leaves which remained yet unconsumed and bravely\nextinguished them, pressing them against her. But all this was very\nlittle, only some _debris_; not a complete page remained, not even a\nfew fragments of the colossal labor, of the vast and patient work of\na lifetime, which the fire had destroyed there in two hours. And with\ngrowing anger, in a burst of furious indignation, she cried:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are thieves, assassins! It is a wicked murder which you have just\ncommitted. You have profaned death, you have slain the mind, you have\nslain genius.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOld Mme. Rougon did not quail. She advanced, on the contrary, feeling\nno remorse, her head erect, defending the sentence of destruction\npronounced and executed by her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is to me you are speaking, to your grandmother. Is there nothing,\nthen, that you respect? I have done what I ought to have done, what you\nyourself wished to do with us before.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBefore, you had made me mad; but since then I have lived, I have loved,\nI have understood, and it is life that I defend. Even if it be terrible\nand cruel, the truth ought to be respected. Besides, it was a sacred\nlegacy bequeathed to my protection, the last thoughts of a dead man, all\nthat remained of a great mind, and which I should have obliged every one\nto respect. Yes, you are my grandmother; I am well aware of it, and it\nis as if you had just burned your son!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBurn Pascal because I have burned his papers!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Felicite. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo\nyou not know that I would have burned the town to save the honor of our\nfamily!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe continued to advance, belligerent and victorious; and Clotilde, who\nhad laid on the table the blackened fragments rescued by her from\nthe burning flames, protected them with her body, fearing that her\ngrandmother would throw them back again into the fire. She regarded the\ntwo women scornfully; she did not even trouble herself about the fire\nin the fireplace, which fortunately went out of itself, while Martine\nextinguished with the shovel the burning soot and the last flames of the\nsmoldering ashes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know very well, however,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the old woman, whose little\nfigure seemed to grow taller, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I have had only one ambition, one\npassion in life--to see our family rich and powerful. I have fought, I\nhave watched all my life, I have lived as long as I have done, only to\nput down ugly stories and to leave our name a glorious one. Yes, I have\nnever despaired; I have never laid down my arms; I have been continually\non the alert, ready to profit by the slightest circumstance. And all I\ndesired to do I have done, because I have known how to wait.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she waved her hand toward the empty press and the fireplace, where\nthe last sparks were dying out.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow it is ended, our honor is safe; those abominable papers will no\nlonger accuse us, and I shall leave behind me nothing to be feared. The\nRougons have triumphed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde, in a frenzy of grief, raised her arm, as if to drive her out\nof the room. But she left it of her own accord, and went down to the\nkitchen to wash her blackened hands and to fasten up her hair. The\nservant was about to follow her when, turning her head, she saw her\nyoung mistress\u00e2\u0080\u0099 gesture, and she returned.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! as for me, mademoiselle, I will go away the day after to-morrow,\nwhen monsieur shall be in the cemetery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s silence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I am not sending you away, Martine. I know well that it is not you\nwho are most to blame. You have lived in this house for thirty years.\nRemain, remain with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old maid shook her gray head, looking very pale and tired.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I have served monsieur; I will serve no one after monsieur.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou, no!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClotilde looked embarrassed, hesitated a moment, and remained silent.\nBut Martine understood; she too seemed to reflect for an instant, and\nthen she said distinctly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know what you would say, but--no!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she went on to settle her account, arranging the affair like a\npractical woman who knew the value of money.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSince I have the means, I will go and live quietly on my income\nsomewhere. As for you, mademoiselle, I can leave you, for you are not\npoor. M. Ramond will explain to you to-morrow how an income of four\nthousand francs was saved for you out of the money at the notary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\nMeantime, here is the key of the desk, where you will find the five\nthousand francs which monsieur left there. Oh? I know that there will\nbe no trouble between us. Monsieur did not pay me for the last three\nmonths; I have papers from him which prove it. In addition, I advanced\nlately almost two hundred francs out of my own pocket, without his\nknowing where the money came from. It is all written down; I am not at\nall uneasy; mademoiselle will not wrong me by a centime. The day after\nto-morrow, when monsieur is no longer here, I will go away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen she went down to the kitchen, and Clotilde, in spite of the\nfanaticism of this woman, which had made her take part in a crime,\nfelt inexpressibly sad at this desertion. When she was gathering up the\nfragments of the papers, however, before returning to the bedroom, she\nhad a thrill of joy, on suddenly seeing the genealogical tree, which\nthe two women had not perceived, lying unharmed on the table. It was the\nonly entire document saved from the wreck. She took it and locked it,\nwith the half-consumed fragments, in the bureau in the bedroom.\n\nBut when she found herself again in this august chamber a great emotion\ntook possession of her. What supreme calm, what immortal peace, reigned\nhere, beside the savage destruction that had filled the adjoining room\nwith smoke and ashes. A sacred serenity pervaded the obscurity; the two\ntapers burned with a pure, still, unwavering flame. Then she saw that\nPascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, framed in his flowing white hair and beard, had become\nvery white. He slept with the light falling upon him, surrounded by a\nhalo, supremely beautiful. She bent down, kissed him again, felt on her\nlips the cold of the marble face, with its closed eyelids, dreaming its\ndream of eternity. Her grief at not being able to save the work which he\nhad left to her care was so overpowering that she fell on her knees and\nburst into a passion of sobs. Genius had been violated; it seemed to her\nas if the world was about to be destroyed in this savage destruction of\na whole life of labor.\n\n\n\n\nXIV.\n\nIn the study Clotilde was buttoning her dress, holding her child, whom\nshe had been nursing, still in her lap. It was after lunch, about\nthree o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock on a hot sunny day at the end of August, and through the\ncrevices of the carefully closed shutters only a few scattered sunbeams\nentered, piercing the drowsy and warm obscurity of the vast apartment.\nThe rest and peace of the Sunday seemed to enter and diffuse itself\nin the room with the last sounds of the distant vesper bell. Profound\nsilence reigned in the empty house in which the mother and child were to\nremain alone until dinner time, the servant having asked permission to\ngo see a cousin in the faubourg.\n\nFor an instant Clotilde looked at her child, now a big boy of three\nmonths. She had been wearing mourning for Pascal for almost ten\nmonths--a long and simple black gown, in which she looked divinely\nbeautiful, with her tall, slender figure and her sad, youthful face\nsurrounded by its aureole of fair hair. And although she could not\nsmile, it filled her with sweet emotion to see the beautiful child, so\nplump and rosy, with his mouth still wet with milk, whose gaze had\nbeen arrested by the sunbeam full of dancing motes. His eyes were fixed\nwonderingly on the golden brightness, the dazzling miracle of light.\nThen sleep came over him, and he let his little, round, bare head,\ncovered thinly with fair hair, fall back on his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm.\n\nClotilde rose softly and laid him in the cradle, which stood beside the\ntable. She remained leaning over him for an instant to assure herself\nthat he was asleep; then she let down the curtain in the already\ndarkened room. Then she busied herself with supple and noiseless\nmovements, walking with so light a step that she scarcely touched the\nfloor, in putting away some linen which was on the table. Twice she\ncrossed the room in search of a little missing sock. She was very\nsilent, very gentle, and very active. And now, in the solitude of the\nhouse, she fell into a reverie and all the past year arose before her.\n\nFirst, after the dreadful shock of the funeral, came the departure of\nMartine, who had obstinately kept to her determination of going away at\nonce, not even remaining for the customary week, bringing to replace her\nthe young cousin of a baker in the neighborhood--a stout brunette, who\nfortunately proved very neat and faithful. Martine herself lived at\nSainte-Marthe, in a retired corner, so penuriously that she must be\nstill saving even out of her small income. She was not known to have any\nheir. Who, then, would profit by this miserliness? In ten months she had\nnot once set foot in La Souleiade--monsieur was not there, and she had\nnot even the desire to see monsieur\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son.\n\nThen in Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reverie rose the figure of her grandmother Felicite.\nThe latter came to see her from time to time with the condescension of a\npowerful relation who is liberal-minded enough to pardon all faults when\nthey have been cruelly expiated. She would come unexpectedly, kiss\nthe child, moralize, and give advice, and the young mother had adopted\ntoward her the respectful attitude which Pascal had always maintained.\nFelicite was now wholly absorbed in her triumph. She was at last about\nto realize a plan that she had long cherished and maturely deliberated,\nwhich would perpetuate by an imperishable monument the untarnished glory\nof the family. The plan was to devote her fortune, which had become\nconsiderable, to the construction and endowment of an asylum for the\naged, to be called Rougon Asylum. She had already bought the ground,\na part of the old mall outside the town, near the railway station; and\nprecisely on this Sunday, at five o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, when the heat should have\nabated a little, the first stone was to be laid, a really solemn\nceremony, to be honored by the presence of all the authorities, and of\nwhich she was to be the acknowledged queen, before a vast concourse of\npeople.\n\nClotilde felt, besides, some gratitude toward her grandmother, who\nhad shown perfect disinterestedness on the occasion of the opening\nof Pascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s will. The latter had constituted the young woman his\nsole legatee; and the mother, who had a right to a fourth part,\nafter declaring her intention to respect her son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wishes, had simply\nrenounced her right to the succession. She wished, indeed, to disinherit\nall her family, bequeathing to them glory only, by employing her large\nfortune in the erection of this asylum, which was to carry down to\nfuture ages the revered and glorious name of the Rougons; and after\nhaving, for more than half a century, so eagerly striven to acquire\nmoney, she now disdained it, moved by a higher and purer ambition. And\nClotilde, thanks to this liberality, had no uneasiness regarding the\nfuture--the four thousand francs income would be sufficient for her and\nher child. She would bring him up to be a man. She had sunk the five\nthousand francs that she had found in the desk in an annuity for him;\nand she owned, besides, La Souleiade, which everybody advised her\nto sell. True, it cost but little to keep it up, but what a sad and\nsolitary life she would lead in that great deserted house, much too\nlarge for her, where she would be lost. Thus far, however, she had not\nbeen able to make up her mind to leave it. Perhaps she would never be\nable to do so.\n\nAh, this La Souleiade! all her love, all her life, all her memories were\ncentered in it. It seemed to her at times as if Pascal were living here\nstill, for she had changed nothing of their former manner of living.\nThe furniture remained in the same places, the hours were the same, the\nhabits the same. The only change she had made was to lock his room,\ninto which only she went, as into a sanctuary, to weep when she felt her\nheart too heavy. And although indeed she felt very lonely, very lost, at\neach meal in the bright dining-room downstairs, in fancy she heard there\nthe echoes of their laughter, she recalled the healthy appetite of her\nyouth; when they two had eaten and drank so gaily, rejoicing in their\nexistence. And the garden, too, the whole place was bound up with the\nmost intimate fibers of her being, for she could not take a step in it\nthat their united images did not appear before her--on the terrace; in\nthe slender shadow of the great secular cypresses, where they had so\noften contemplated the valley of the Viorne, closed in by the ridges of\nthe Seille and the parched hills of Sainte-Marthe; the stone steps among\nthe puny olive and almond trees, which they had so often challenged\neach other to run up in a trial of speed, like boys just let loose from\nschool; and there was the pine grove, too, the warm, embalsamed shade,\nwhere the needles crackled under their feet; the vast threshing yard,\ncarpeted with soft grass, where they could see the whole sky at night,\nwhen the stars were coming out; and above all there were the giant plane\ntrees, whose delightful shade they had enjoyed every day in summer,\nlistening to the soothing song of the fountain, the crystal clear song\nwhich it had sung for centuries. Even to the old stones of the house,\neven to the earth of the grounds, there was not an atom at La Souleiade\nin which she did not feel a little of their blood warmly throbbing, with\nwhich she did not feel a little of their life diffused and mingled.\n\nBut she preferred to spend her days in the workroom, and here it was\nthat she lived over again her best hours. There was nothing new in it\nbut the cradle. The doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s table was in its place before the window to\nthe left--she could fancy him coming in and sitting down at it, for his\nchair had not even been moved. On the long table in the center, among\nthe old heap of books and papers, there was nothing new but the cheerful\nnote of the little baby linen, which she was looking over. The bookcases\ndisplayed the same rows of volumes; the large oaken press seemed to\nguard within its sides the same treasure, securely shut in. Under the\nsmoky ceiling the room was still redolent of work, with its confusion of\nchairs, the pleasant disorder of this common workroom, filled with the\ncaprices of the girl and the researches of the scientist. But what most\nmoved her to-day was the sight of her old pastels hanging against the\nwall, the copies which she had made of living flowers, scrupulously\nexact copies, and of dream flowers of an imaginary world, whither her\nwild fancy sometimes carried her.\n\nClotilde had just finished arranging the little garments on the table\nwhen, lifting her eyes, she perceived before her the pastel of old\nKing David, with his hand resting on the shoulder of Abishag the young\nShunammite. And she, who now never smiled, felt her face flush with a\nthrill of tender and pleasing emotion. How they had loved each other,\nhow they had dreamed of an eternity of love the day on which she had\namused herself painting this proud and loving allegory! The old king,\nsumptuously clad in a robe hanging in straight folds, heavy with\nprecious stones, wore the royal bandeau on his snowy locks; but she was\nmore sumptuous still, with only her tall slender figure, her delicate\nround throat, and her supple arms, divinely graceful. Now he was gone,\nhe was sleeping under the ground, while she, her pure and triumphant\nbeauty concealed by her black robes, had only her child to express the\nlove she had given him before the assembled people, in the full light of\nday.\n\nThen Clotilde sat down beside the cradle. The slender sunbeams\nlengthened, crossing the room from end to end, the heat of the warm\nafternoon grew oppressive in the drowsy obscurity made by the closed\nshutters, and the silence of the house seemed more profound than\nbefore. She set apart some little waists, she sewed on some tapes with\nslow-moving needle, and gradually she fell into a reverie in the warm\ndeep peacefulness of the room, in the midst of the glowing heat outside.\nHer thoughts first turned to her pastels, the exact copies and the\nfantastic dream flowers; she said to herself now that all her dual\nnature was to be found in that passion for truth, which had at times\nkept her a whole day before a flower in order to copy it with exactness,\nand in her need of the spiritual, which at other times took her outside\nthe real, and carried her in wild dreams to the paradise of flowers such\nas had never grown on earth. She had always been thus. She felt that she\nwas in reality the same to-day as she had been yesterday, in the midst\nof the flow of new life which ceaselessly transformed her. And then she\nthought of Pascal, full of gratitude that he had made her what she was.\nIn days past when, a little girl, he had removed her from her execrable\nsurroundings and taken her home with him, he had undoubtedly followed\nthe impulses of his good heart, but he had also undoubtedly desired\nto try an experiment with her, to see how she would grow up in the\ndifferent environment, in an atmosphere of truthfulness and affection.\nThis had always been an idea of his. It was an old theory of his\nwhich he would have liked to test on a large scale: culture through\nenvironment, complete regeneration even, the improvement, the salvation\nof the individual, physically as well as morally. She owed to him\nundoubtedly the best part of her nature; she guessed how fanciful and\nviolent she might have become, while he had made her only enthusiastic\nand courageous.\n\nIn this retrospection she was clearly conscious of the gradual change\nthat had taken place within her. Pascal had corrected her heredity,\nand she lived over again the slow evolution, the struggle between the\nfantastic and the real in her. It had begun with her outbursts of anger\nas a child, a ferment of rebellion, a want of mental balance that had\ncaused her to indulge in most hurtful reveries. Then came her fits\nof extreme devotion, the need of illusion and falsehood, of immediate\nhappiness in the thought that the inequalities and injustices of this\nwicked world would he compensated by the eternal joys of a future\nparadise. This was the epoch of her struggles with Pascal, of the\ntorture which she had caused him, planning to destroy the work of his\ngenius. And at this point her nature had changed; she had acknowledged\nhim for her master. He had conquered her by the terrible lesson of life\nwhich he had given her on the night of the storm. Then, environment had\nacted upon her, evolution had proceeded rapidly, and she had ended by\nbecoming a well-balanced and rational woman, willing to live life as it\nought to be lived, satisfied with doing her work in the hope that the\nsum of the common labor would one day free the world from evil and pain.\nShe had loved, she was a mother now, and she understood.\n\nSuddenly she remembered the night which they had spent in the threshing\nyard. She could still hear her lamentation under the stars--the cruelty\nof nature, the inefficacy of science, the wickedness of humanity, and\nthe need she felt of losing herself in God, in the Unknown. Happiness\nconsisted in self-renunciation. Then she heard him repeat his creed--the\nprogress of reason through science, truths acquired slowly and forever\nthe only possible good, the belief that the sum of these truths, always\naugmenting, would finally confer upon man incalculable power and peace,\nif not happiness. All was summed up in his ardent faith in life. As he\nexpressed it, it was necessary to march with life, which marched always.\nNo halt was to be expected, no peace in immobility and renunciation, no\nconsolation in turning back. One must keep a steadfast soul, the only\nambition to perform one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work, modestly looking for no other reward\nof life than to have lived it bravely, accomplishing the task which it\nimposes. Evil was only an accident not yet explained, humanity appearing\nfrom a great height like an immense wheel in action, working ceaselessly\nfor the future. Why should the workman who disappeared, having finished\nhis day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work, abuse the work because he could neither see nor know its\nend? Even if it were to have no end why should he not enjoy the delight\nof action, the exhilarating air of the march, the sweetness of sleep\nafter the fatigue of a long and busy day? The children would carry on\nthe task of the parents; they were born and cherished only for this, for\nthe task of life which is transmitted to them, which they in their turn\nwill transmit to others. All that remained, then, was to be courageously\nresigned to the grand common labor, without the rebellion of the ego,\nwhich demands personal happiness, perfect and complete.\n\nShe questioned herself, and she found that she did not experience that\nanguish which had filled her formerly at the thought of what was to\nfollow death. This anxiety about the Beyond no longer haunted her until\nit became a torture. Formerly she would have liked to wrest by force\nfrom heaven the secrets of destiny. It had been a source of infinite\ngrief to her not to know why she existed. Why are we born? What do we\ncome on earth to do? What is the meaning of this execrable existence,\nwithout equality, without justice, which seemed to her like a fevered\ndream? Now her terror was calmed; she could think of these things\ncourageously. Perhaps it was her child, the continuation of herself,\nwhich now concealed from her the horror of her end. But her regular life\ncontributed also to this, the thought that it was necessary to live for\nthe effort of living, and that the only peace possible in this world was\nin the joy of the accomplishment of this effort. She repeated to herself\na remark of the doctor, who would often say when he saw a peasant\nreturning home with a contented look after his day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a\nman whom anxiety about the Beyond will not prevent from sleeping.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He\nmeant to say that this anxiety troubles and perverts only excitable\nand idle brains. If all performed their healthful task, all would sleep\npeacefully at night. She herself had felt the beneficent power of work\nin the midst of her sufferings and her grief. Since he had taught her to\nemploy every one of her hours; since she had been a mother, especially,\noccupied constantly with her child, she no longer felt a chill of\nhorror when she thought of the Unknown. She put aside without an effort\ndisquieting reveries; and if she still felt an occasional fear, if\nsome of her daily griefs made her sick at heart, she found comfort and\nunfailing strength in the thought that her child was this day a day\nolder, that he would be another day older on the morrow, that day\nby day, page by page, his work of life was being accomplished. This\nconsoled her delightfully for all her miseries. She had a duty, an\nobject, and she felt in her happy serenity that she was doing surely\nwhat she had been sent here to do.\n\nYet, even at this very moment she knew that the mystic was not entirely\ndead within her. In the midst of the profound silence she heard a slight\nnoise, and she raised her head. Who was the divine mediator that\nhad passed? Perhaps the beloved dead for whom she mourned, and whose\npresence near her she fancied she could divine. There must always be\nin her something of the childlike believer she had always been, curious\nabout the Unknown, having an instinctive longing for the mysterious.\nShe accounted to herself for this longing, she even explained it\nscientifically. However far science may extend the limits of human\nknowledge, there is undoubtedly a point which it cannot pass; and it\nwas here precisely that Pascal placed the only interest in life--in\nthe effort which we ceaselessly make to know more--there was only one\nreasonable meaning in life, this continual conquest of the unknown.\nTherefore, she admitted the existence of undiscovered forces surrounding\nthe world, an immense and obscure domain, ten times larger than the\ndomain already won, an infinite and unexplored realm through which\nfuture humanity would endlessly ascend. Here, indeed, was a field vast\nenough for the imagination to lose itself in. In her hours of reverie\nshe satisfied in it the imperious need which man seems to have for the\nspiritual, a need of escaping from the visible world, of interrogating\nthe Unknown, of satisfying in it the dream of absolute justice and of\nfuture happiness. All that remained of her former torture, her last\nmystic transports, were there appeased. She satisfied there that hunger\nfor consoling illusions which suffering humanity must satisfy in order\nto live. But in her all was happily balanced. At this crisis, in an\nepoch overburdened with science, disquieted at the ruins it has made,\nand seized with fright in the face of the new century, wildly desiring\nto stop and to return to the past, Clotilde kept the happy mean; in her\nthe passion for truth was broadened by her eagerness to penetrate the\nUnknown. If sectarian scientists shut out the horizon to keep strictly\nto the phenomenon, it was permitted to her, a good, simple creature, to\nreserve the part that she did not know, that she would never know. And\nif Pascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s creed was the logical deduction from the whole work, the\neternal question of the Beyond, which she still continued to put to\nheaven, reopened the door of the infinite to humanity marching ever\nonward. Since we must always learn, while resigning ourselves never\nto know all, was it not to will action, life itself, to reserve the\nUnknown--an eternal doubt and an eternal hope?\n\nAnother sound, as of a wing passing, the light touch of a kiss upon her\nhair, this time made her smile. He was surely here; and her whole being\nwent out toward him, in the great flood of tenderness with which her\nheart overflowed. How kind and cheerful he was, and what a love for\nothers underlay his passionate love of life! Perhaps he, too, had been\nonly a dreamer, for he had dreamed the most beautiful of dreams, the\nfinal belief in a better world, when science should have bestowed\nincalculable power upon man--to accept everything, to turn everything\nto our happiness, to know everything and to foresee everything, to\nmake nature our servant, to live in the tranquillity of intelligence\nsatisfied. Meantime faith in life, voluntary and regular labor, would\nsuffice for health. Evil was only the unexplained side of things;\nsuffering would one day be assuredly utilized. And regarding from above\nthe enormous labor of the world, seeing the sum total of humanity, good\nand bad--admirable, in spite of everything, for their courage and\ntheir industry--she now regarded all mankind as united in a common\nbrotherhood, she now felt only boundless indulgence, an infinite\npity, and an ardent charity. Love, like the sun, bathes the earth, and\ngoodness is the great river at which all hearts drink.\n\nClotilde had been plying her needle for two hours, with the same regular\nmovement, while her thoughts wandered away in the profound silence. But\nthe tapes were sewed on the little waists, she had even marked some new\nwrappers, which she had bought the day before. And, her sewing finished,\nshe rose to put the linen away. Outside the sun was declining, and\nonly slender and oblique sunbeams entered through the crevices of the\nshutters. She could not see clearly, and she opened one of the shutters,\nthen she forgot herself for a moment, at the sight of the vast horizon\nsuddenly unrolled before her. The intense heat had abated, a delicious\nbreeze was blowing, and the sky was of a cloudless blue. To the left\ncould be distinguished even the smallest clumps of pines, among the\nblood-colored ravines of the rocks of the Seille, while to the right,\nbeyond the hills of Sainte-Marthe, the valley of the Viorne stretched\naway in the golden dust of the setting sun. She looked for a moment at\nthe tower of St. Saturnin, all golden also, dominating the rose-colored\ntown; and she was about to leave the window when she saw a sight that\ndrew her back and kept her there, leaning on her elbow for a long time\nstill.\n\nBeyond the railroad a multitude of people were crowded together on the\nold mall. Clotilde at once remembered the ceremony. She knew that her\nGrandmother Felicite was going to lay the first stone of the Rougon\nAsylum, the triumphant monument destined to carry down to future ages\nthe glory of the family. Vast preparations had been going on for a week\npast. There was talk of a silver hod and trowel, which the old lady was\nto use herself, determined to figure to triumph, with her eighty-two\nyears. What swelled her heart with regal pride was that on this occasion\nshe made the conquest of Plassans for the third time, for she compelled\nthe whole town, all the three quarters, to range themselves around her,\nto form an escort for her, and to applaud her as a benefactress. For, of\ncourse, there had to be present lady patronesses, chosen from among the\nnoblest ladies of the Quartier St. Marc; a delegation from the\nsocieties of working-women of the old quarter, and, finally, the\nmost distinguished residents of the new town, advocates, notaries,\nphysicians, without counting the common people, a stream of people\ndressed in their Sunday clothes, crowding there eagerly, as to a\nfestival. And in the midst of this supreme triumph she was perhaps\nmost proud--she, one of the queens of the Second Empire, the widow who\nmourned with so much dignity the fallen government--in having\nconquered the young republic itself, obliging it, in the person of the\nsub-prefect, to come and salute her and thank her. At first there had\nbeen question only of a discourse of the mayor; but it was known with\ncertainty, since the previous day, that the sub-prefect also would\nspeak. From so great a distance Clotilde could distinguish only a moving\ncrowd of black coats and light dresses, under the scorching sun. Then\nthere was a distant sound of music, the music of the amateur band of the\ntown, the sonorous strains of whose brass instruments were borne to her\nat intervals on the breeze.\n\nShe left the window and went and opened the large oaken press to put\naway in it the linen that had remained on the table. It was in this\npress, formerly so full of the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manuscripts, and now empty,\nthat she kept the baby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wardrobe. It yawned open, vast, seemingly\nbottomless, and on the large bare shelves there was nothing but the baby\nlinen, the little waists, the little caps, the little socks, all the\nfine clothing, the down of the bird still in the nest. Where so many\nthoughts had been stored up, where a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unremitting labor for thirty\nyears had accumulated in an overflowing heap of papers, there was now\nonly a baby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clothing, only the first garments which would protect it\nfor an hour, as it were, and which very soon it could no longer use.\nThe vastness of the antique press seemed brightened and all refreshed by\nthem.\n\nWhen Clotilde had arranged the wrappers and the waists upon a shelf,\nshe perceived a large envelope containing the fragments of the documents\nwhich she had placed there after she had rescued them from the fire. And\nshe remembered a request which Dr. Ramond had come only the day before\nto make her--that she would see if there remained among this _debris_\nany fragment of importance having a scientific interest. He was\ninconsolable for the loss of the precious manuscripts which the master\nhad bequeathed to him. Immediately after the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death he had made\nan attempt to write from memory his last talk, that summary of vast\ntheories expounded by the dying man with so heroic a serenity; but he\ncould recall only parts of it. He would have needed complete notes,\nobservations made from day to day, the results obtained, and the laws\nformulated. The loss was irreparable, the task was to be begun over\nagain, and he lamented having only indications; he said that it would be\nat least twenty years before science could make up the loss, and take up\nand utilize the ideas of the solitary pioneer whose labors a wicked and\nimbecile catastrophe had destroyed.\n\nThe genealogical tree, the only document that had remained intact, was\nattached to the envelope, and Clotilde carried the whole to the table\nbeside the cradle. After she had taken out the fragments, one by one,\nshe found, what she had been already almost certain of, that not a\nsingle entire page of manuscript remained, not a single complete note\nhaving any meaning. There were only fragments of documents, scraps of\nhalf-burned and blackened paper, without sequence or connection. But as\nshe examined them, these incomplete phrases, these words half consumed\nby fire, assumed for her an interest which no one else could have\nunderstood. She remembered the night of the storm, and the phrases\ncompleted themselves, the beginning of a word evoked before her persons\nand histories. Thus her eye fell on Maxime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name, and she reviewed\nthe life of this brother who had remained a stranger to her, and whose\ndeath, two months before, had left her almost indifferent. Then, a\nhalf-burned scrap containing her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name gave her an uneasy\nfeeling, for she believed that her father had obtained possession of the\nfortune and the house on the avenue of Bois de Boulogne through the good\noffices of his hairdresser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s niece, the innocent Rose, repaid, no doubt,\nby a generous percentage. Then she met with other names, that of\nher uncle Eugene, the former vice emperor, now dead, the cure\nof Saint-Eutrope, who, she had been told yesterday, was dying of\nconsumption. And each fragment became animated in this way; the\nexecrable family lived again in these scraps, these black ashes, where\nwere now only disconnected words.\n\nThen Clotilde had the curiosity to unfold the genealogical tree and\nspread it out upon the table. A strong emotion gained on her; she was\ndeeply affected by these relics; and when she read once more the notes\nadded in pencil by Pascal, a few moments before his death, tears rose to\nher eyes. With what courage he had written down the date of his death!\nAnd what despairing regret for life one divined in the trembling words\nannouncing the birth of the child! The tree ascended, spread out\nits branches, unfolded its leaves, and she remained for a long time\ncontemplating it, saying to herself that all the work of the master\nwas to be found here in the classified records of this family tree.\nShe could still hear certain of his words commenting on each hereditary\ncase, she recalled his lessons. But the children, above all, interested\nher; she read again and again the notes on the leaves which bore their\nnames. The doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s colleague in Noumea, to whom he had written for\ninformation about the child born of the marriage of the convict Etienne,\nhad at last made up his mind to answer; but the only information he gave\nwas in regard to the sex--it was a girl, he said, and she seemed to be\nhealthy. Octave Mouret had come near losing his daughter, who had always\nbeen very frail, while his little boy continued to enjoy superb health.\nBut the chosen abode of vigorous health and of extraordinary fecundity\nwas still the house of Jean, at Valqueyras, whose wife had had two\nchildren in three years and was about to have a third. The nestlings\nthrove in the sunshine, in the heart of a fertile country, while the\nfather sang as he guided his plow, and the mother at home cleverly made\nthe soup and kept the children in order. There was enough new vitality\nand industry there to make another family, a whole race. Clotilde\nfancied at this moment that she could hear Pascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cry: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, our\nfamily! what is it going to be, in what kind of being will it end?\u00e2\u0080\u009d And\nshe fell again into a reverie, looking at the tree sending its latest\nbranches into the future. Who could tell whence the healthy branch would\nspring? Perhaps the great and good man so long awaited was germinating\nthere.\n\nA slight cry drew Clotilde from her reflections. The muslin curtain of\nthe cradle seemed to become animate. It was the child who had wakened up\nand was moving about and calling to her. She at once took him out of the\ncradle and held him up gaily, that he might bathe in the golden light of\nthe setting sun. But he was insensible to the beauty of the closing day;\nhis little vacant eyes, still full of sleep, turned away from the vast\nsky, while he opened wide his rosy and ever hungry mouth, like a bird\nopening its beak. And he cried so loud, he had wakened up so ravenous,\nthat she decided to nurse him again. Besides, it was his hour; it would\nsoon be three hours since she had last nursed him.\n\nClotilde sat down again beside the table. She took him on her lap, but\nhe was not very good, crying louder and louder, growing more and more\nimpatient; and she looked at him with a smile while she unfastened her\ndress, showing her round, slender throat. Already the child knew, and\nraising himself he felt with his lips for the breast. When she placed\nit in his mouth he gave a little grunt of satisfaction; he threw himself\nupon her with the fine, voracious appetite of a young gentleman who was\ndetermined to live. At first he had clutched the breast with his little\nfree hand, as if to show that it was his, to defend it and to guard it.\nThen, in the joy of the warm stream that filled his throat he raised his\nlittle arm straight up, like a flag. And Clotilde kept her unconscious\nsmile, seeing him so healthy, so rosy, and so plump, thriving so well\non the nourishment he drew from her. During the first few weeks she had\nsuffered from a fissure, and even now her breast was sensitive; but she\nsmiled, notwithstanding, with that peaceful look which mothers wear,\nhappy in giving their milk as they would give their blood.\n\nWhen she had unfastened her dress, showing her bare throat and breast,\nin the solitude and silence of the study, another of her mysteries,\none of her sweetest and most hidden secrets, was revealed at the same\ntime--the slender necklace with the seven pearls, the seven fine, milky\nstars which the master had put around her neck on a day of misery, in\nhis mania for giving. Since it had been there no one else had seen it.\nIt seemed as if she guarded it with as much modesty as if it were a part\nof her flesh, so simple, so pure, so childlike. And all the time the\nchild was nursing she alone looked at it in a dreamy reverie, moved by\nthe tender memory of the kisses whose warm perfume it still seemed to\nkeep.\n\nA burst of distant music seemed to surprise Clotilde. She turned her\nhead and looked across the fields gilded by the oblique rays of the sun.\nAh, yes! the ceremony, the laying of the corner stone yonder! Then\nshe turned her eyes again on the child, and she gave herself up to the\ndelight of seeing him with so fine an appetite. She had drawn forward a\nlittle bench, to raise one of her knees, resting her foot upon it,\nand she leaned one shoulder against the table, beside the tree and the\nblackened fragments of the envelopes. Her thoughts wandered away in an\ninfinitely sweet reverie, while she felt the best part of herself, the\npure milk, flowing softly, making more and more her own the dear being\nshe had borne. The child had come, the redeemer, perhaps. The bells\nrang, the three wise men had set out, followed by the people, by\nrejoicing nature, smiling on the infant in its swaddling clothes. She,\nthe mother, while he drank life in long draughts, was dreaming already\nof his future. What would he be when she should have made him tall and\nstrong, giving herself to him entirely? A scientist, perhaps, who would\nreveal to the world something of the eternal truth; or a great captain,\nwho would confer glory on his country; or, still better, one of those\nshepherds of the people who appease the passions and bring about the\nreign of justice. She saw him, in fancy, beautiful, good and powerful.\nHers was the dream of every mother--the conviction that she had brought\nthe expected Messiah into the world; and there was in this hope, in this\nobstinate belief, which every mother has in the certain triumph of her\nchild, the hope which itself makes life, the belief which gives humanity\nthe ever renewed strength to live still.\n\nWhat would the child be? She looked at him, trying to discover whom\nhe resembled. He had certainly his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brow and eyes, there\nwas something noble and strong in the breadth of the head. She saw a\nresemblance to herself, too, in his fine mouth and his delicate chin.\nThen, with secret uneasiness, she sought a resemblance to the others,\nthe terrible ancestors, all those whose names were there inscribed on\nthe tree, unfolding its growth of hereditary leaves. Was it this one, or\nthis, or yet this other, whom he would resemble? She grew calm, however,\nshe could not but hope, her heart swelled with eternal hope. The\nfaith in life which the master had implanted in her kept her brave and\nsteadfast. What did misery, suffering and wickedness matter! Health was\nin universal labor, in the effort made, in the power which fecundates\nand which produces. The work was good when the child blessed love. Then\nhope bloomed anew, in spite of the open wounds, the dark picture of\nhuman shame. It was life perpetuated, tried anew, life which we can\nnever weary of believing good, since we live it so eagerly, with all its\ninjustice and suffering.\n\nClotilde had glanced involuntarily at the ancestral tree spread out\nbeside her. Yes, the menace was there--so many crimes, so much filth,\nside by side with so many tears, and so much patient goodness; so\nextraordinary a mixture of the best and the most vile, a humanity in\nlittle, with all its defects and all its struggles. It was a question\nwhether it would not be better that a thunderbolt should come and\ndestroy all this corrupt and miserable ant-hill. And after so many\nterrible Rougons, so many vile Macquarts, still another had been born.\nLife did not fear to create another of them, in the brave defiance of\nits eternity. It continued its work, propagated itself according to its\nlaws, indifferent to theories, marching on in its endless labor. Even\nat the risk of making monsters, it must of necessity create, since, in\nspite of all it creates, it never wearies of creating in the hope, no\ndoubt, that the healthy and the good will one day come. Life, life,\nwhich flows like a torrent, which continues its work, beginning it over\nand over again, without pause, to the unknown end! life in which we\nbathe, life with its infinity of contrary currents, always in motion,\nand vast as a boundless sea!\n\nA transport of maternal fervor thrilled Clotilde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart, and she\nsmiled, seeing the little voracious mouth drinking her life. It was a\nprayer, an invocation, to the unknown child, as to the unknown God! To\nthe child of the future, to the genius, perhaps, that was to be, to the\nMessiah that the coming century awaited, who would deliver the people\nfrom their doubt and their suffering! Since the nation was to be\nregenerated, had he not come for this work? He would make the experiment\nanew, he would raise up walls, give certainty to those who were in\ndoubt, he would build the city of justice, where the sole law of\nlabor would insure happiness. In troublous times prophets were to be\nexpected--at least let him not be the Antichrist, the destroyer, the\nbeast foretold in the Apocalypse--who would purge the earth of its\nwickedness, when this should become too great. And life would go on\nin spite of everything, only it would be necessary to wait for other\nmyriads of years before the other unknown child, the benefactor, should\nappear.\n\nBut the child had drained her right breast, and, as he was growing\nangry, Clotilde turned him round and gave him the left. Then she began\nto smile, feeling the caress of his greedy little lips. At all events\nshe herself was hope. A mother nursing, was she not the image of the\nworld continued and saved? She bent over, she looked into his limpid\neyes, which opened joyously, eager for the light. What did the child say\nto her that she felt her heart beat more quickly under the breast which\nhe was draining? To what cause would he give his blood when he should\nbe a man, strong with all the milk which he would have drunk? Perhaps he\nsaid nothing to her, perhaps he already deceived her, and yet she was so\nhappy, so full of perfect confidence in him.\n\nAgain there was a distant burst of music. This must be the apotheosis,\nthe moment when Grandmother Felicite, with her silver trowel, laid the\nfirst stone of the monument to the glory of the Rougons. The vast blue\nsky, gladdened by the Sunday festivities, rejoiced. And in the warm\nsilence, in the solitary peace of the workroom, Clotilde smiled at the\nchild, who was still nursing, his little arm held straight up in the\nair, like a signal flag of life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Doctor Pascal, by Emile Zola\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DOCTOR PASCAL ***\n\n***** This file should be named 10720-0.txt or 10720-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/0\/7\/2\/10720\/\n\nProduced by David Widger, Dagny, and John Bickers\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":166,"split":"train"}
