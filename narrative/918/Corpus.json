{"ori_id":"d226b0c7fb662f93cc3298e3caa21212f59e0a36","title":"Mean Streets","context":"Mean Streets\n Charlie (Harvey Keitel) is a young Italian-American man who is trying to move up in the local New York Mafia but is hampered by his feeling of responsibility towards his reckless younger friend Johnny Boy (Robert De Niro), a small-time gambler who owes money to many loan sharks. Charlie works for his uncle Giovanni (Cesare Danova), the local caporegime, mostly collecting debts. He is also having a secret affair with Johnny Boy's cousin Teresa (Amy Robinson), who has epilepsy and is ostracized because of her condition\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially by Charlie's uncle. Charlie's uncle, a dignified man who takes his role as caporegime seriously, also wants Charlie not to be such close friends with Johnny, saying \"Honorable men go with honorable men.\"\nCharlie is torn between his devout Catholicism and his Mafia ambitions. As the film progresses, Johnny becomes increasingly self-destructive and disrespectful of his creditors. Failing to receive redemption in the church, Charlie seeks it through sacrificing himself on Johnny's behalf.\nAt a bar, a local loan shark named Michael (Richard Romanus) comes looking for Johnny to \"pay up\", but to his surprise, Johnny insults him. Michael lunges at Johnny, who retaliates by pulling a gun on him. After a tense standoff, Michael walks away, and Charlie convinces Johnny that they should leave town for a brief period. Teresa insists on coming with them. Charlie borrows a car and they drive off, escaping the neighborhood without incident. But then a car that had been following them suddenly pulls up alongside, Michael at the wheel and his henchman, Jimmy Shorts (Martin Scorsese), in the backseat. Jimmy fires several shots at Charlie's car, hitting Johnny in the neck and Charlie in the hand, causing Charlie to crash the car. The film ends with an ambulance and police arriving at the scene, and paramedics take them away.\n<html>\n<head><title>Mean Streets Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Mean Streets script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Mean Streets script, Mean Streets movie script, Mean Streets film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

He was expelled\n          from high school for vandalism and consequently spent\n          several months in reform school. He is reckless,\n          unambitious, nihilistic, and was classified a psychiatric 4-\n          F. He is first cousin of TERESA RONCHALI who lives next\n          door to CHARLIE. He has adopted TERESA'S family as his own\n          and spends more time with them than he does with his mother.\n                         \n          JOHNNY is carrying a package wrapped in plain brown paper\n          under his arm, and he is smiling.

But he is moving a little\n          faster now and smiling a little more.\n                         \n          Suddenly the mailbox explodes.

She has however, been having an\n          affair with CHARLIE for the past year.

He makes his way toward the large flight board\n          that looms over the whole room. Loudspeakers announce\n          planes to and from every part of the world.

He passes the insurance machines\n          and almost stops - more upset than before. A businessman\n          calmly pays for insurance. (Muzak is heard) CHARLIE\n          continues on past a novelty shop where some plastic crosses\n          and St. Christopher medals hang alongside the stuffed toy\n          dogs and flight bags.
