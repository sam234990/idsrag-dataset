He grows up in Tokyo as a reckless and rambunctious youth. In the opening chapter he hurts himself jumping from the second floor of his elementary school, fights the boy next door, and tramples a neighbor's carrot patch by wrestling (sum\u0139\u008d style) on the straw that covers the seedlings. His parents favor his older brother, who is quiet and studious. Botchan is also not well regarded in the neighborhood, having a reputation as the local roughneck. Kiyo, the family's elderly maidservant, is the only one who finds anything redeeming in Botchan's character.\nAfter Botchan's mother passes away, Kiyo devotes herself fervently to his welfare, treating him from her own allowance with gifts and favors. Botchan initially finds her affection onerous, but over time he grows to appreciate her dedication, and she eventually becomes his mother figure and moral role model.\nSix years after his mother's death, as Botchan is finishing middle school, his father falls ill and passes away. His older brother liquidates the family assets and provides Botchan with 600 yen before leaving to start his own career. Botchan uses this money to study physics for three years. On graduating, he accepts a job teaching middle school mathematics in Matsuyama on the island of Shikoku.\nBotchan's tenure in Matsuyama turns out to be short (less than two months) but eventful. His arrogance and quick temper immediately lead to clashes with the students and staff. The students retaliate excessively by tracking his every movement in the small town and traumatizing him during his 'night duty' stay in the dormitory.\nMischief by the students turns out to be just the first salvo in a broader web of intrigue and villainy. The school's head teacher (Red Shirt) and English teacher (Uranari) are vying for the hand of the local beauty, and two camps have formed within the middle school staff. Botchan struggles initially to see through the guises and sort out the players. After several missteps, he concludes that Uranari and the head mathematics teacher (Yama Arashi) hold the moral high ground in the conflict. Red Shirt, who presents himself as a refined scholar, turns out to be highly superficial and self-serving.\nAs the story progresses, Red Shirt schemes to eliminate his rivals. He begins by having Uranari transferred to a remote post on the pretext of furthering his career. Next he uses a contrived street brawl and his newspaper connections to defame both mathematics teachers (Botchan and Yama Arashi) and to force Yama Arashi's resignation.\nBotchan and Yama Arashi realize that they cannot beat the system, so they scheme a way to get even. They stake out Red Shirt's known haunt, an inn near the hot springs town, and catch him and his sidekick Nodaiko sneaking home in the morning after overnighting with geisha. With his usual eloquence, Red Shirt points out that they have no direct proof of any wrongdoing. Botchan and Yama Arashi overcome this technicality by pummeling both Red Shirt and Nodaiko into submission on the spot.\nAfter dispensing justice with his fists, Botchan drops a letter of resignation into the mail and immediately heads for the harbor. He returns to Tokyo, finds employment, and establishes a modest household with Kiyo. When Kiyo passes away, he has her respectfully interred in his own family's grave plot.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's Botchan (Master Darling), by Kin-nosuke Natsume\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

R. KENNEDY\n\n1919\n\n\n\nA NOTE BY THE TRANSLATOR\n\nNo translation can expect to equal, much less to excel, the original.\nThe excellence of a translation can only be judged by noting how far it\nhas succeeded in reproducing the original tone, colors, style, the\ndelicacy of sentiment, the force of inert strength, the peculiar\nexpressions native to the language with which the original is written,\nor whatever is its marked characteristic. The ablest can do no more, and\nto want more than this will be demanding something impossible. Strictly\nspeaking, the only way one can derive full benefit or enjoyment from a\nforeign work is to read the original, for any intelligence at\nsecond-hand never gives the kind of satisfaction which is possible only\nthrough the direct touch with the original. Even in the best translated\nwork is probably wanted the subtle vitality natural to the original\nlanguage, for it defies an attempt, however elaborate, to transmit all\nthere is in the original. Correctness of diction may be there, but\nspontaneity is gone; it cannot be helped.\n\nThe task of the translator becomes doubly hazardous in case of\ntranslating a European language into Japanese, or vice versa. Between\nany of the European languages and Japanese there is no visible kinship\nin word-form, significance, grammatical system, rhetorical arrangements.\nIt may be said that the inspiration of the two languages is totally\ndifferent. A want of similarity of customs, habits, traditions, national\nsentiments and traits makes the work of translation all the more\ndifficult. A novel written in Japanese which had attained national\npopularity might, when rendered into English, lose its captivating\nvividness, alluring interest and lasting appeal to the reader.\n\nThese remarks are made not in way of excuse for any faulty dictions that\nmay be found in the following pages. Neither are they made out of\npersonal modesty nor of a desire to add undue weight to the present\nwork. They are made in the hope that whoever is good enough to go\nthrough the present translation will remember, before he may venture to\nmake criticisms, the kind and extent of difficulties besetting him in\nhis attempts so as not to judge the merit of the original by this\ntranslation. Nothing would afford the translator a greater pain than any\nunfavorable comment on the original based upon this translation. If\nthere be any deserving merits in the following pages the credit is due\nto the original. Any fault found in its interpretation or in the English\nversion, the whole responsibility is on the translator.\n\nFor the benefit of those who may not know the original, it must be\nstated that \"Botchan\" by the late Mr. K. Natsume was an epoch-making\npiece of work. On its first appearance, Mr. Natsume's place and name as\nthe foremost in the new literary school were firmly established. He had\nwritten many other novels of more serious intent, of heavier thoughts\nand of more enduring merits, but it was this \"Botchan\" that secured him\nthe lasting fame. Its quaint style, dash and vigor in its narration\nappealed to the public who had become somewhat tired of the stereotyped\nsort of manner with which all stories had come to be handled.\n\nIn its simplest understanding, \"Botchan\" may be taken as an episode in\nthe life of a son born in Tokyo, hot-blooded, simple-hearted, pure as\ncrystal and sturdy as a towering rock, honest and straight to a fault,\nintolerant of the least injustice and a volunteer ever ready to champion\nwhat he considers right and good. Children may read it as a \"story of\nman who tried to be honest.\" It is a light, amusing and, at the name\ntime, instructive story, with no tangle of love affairs, no scheme of\nblood-curdling scenes or nothing startling or sensational in the plot or\ncharacters. The story, however, may be regarded as a biting sarcasm on a\nhypocritical society in which a gang of instructors of dark character at\na middle school in a backwoods town plays a prominent part. The hero of\nthe story is made a victim of their annoying intrigues, but finally\ncomes out triumphant by smashing the petty red tapism, knocking down the\nsham pretentions and by actual use of the fist on the Head Instructor\nand his henchman.\n\nThe story will be found equally entertaining as a means of studying the\npeculiar traits of the native of Tokyo which are characterised by their\nquick temper, dashing spirit, generosity and by their readiness to\nresist even the lordly personage if convinced of their own justness, or\nto kneel down even to a child if they acknowledge their own wrong.\nIncidently the touching devotion of the old maid servant Kiyo to the\nhero will prove a standing reproach to the inconstant, unfaithful\nservants of which the number is ever increasing these days in Tokyo. The\nstory becomes doubly interesting by the fact that Mr. K. Natsume, when\nquite young, held a position of teacher of English at a middle school\nsomewhere about the same part of the country described in the story,\nwhile he himself was born and brought up in Tokyo.\n\nIt may be added that the original is written in an autobiographical\nstyle. It is profusely interladed with spicy, catchy colloquials patent\nto the people of Tokyo for the equals of which we may look to the\nrattling speeches of notorious Chuck Conners of the Bowery of New York.\nIt should be frankly stated that much difficulty was experienced in\ngetting the corresponding terms in English for those catchy expressions.\nStrictly speaking, some of them have no English equivalents. Care has\nbeen exercised to select what has been thought most appropriate in the\njudgment or the translator in converting those expressions into English\nbut some of them might provoke disapproval from those of the \"cultured\"\nclass with \"refined\" ears. The slangs in English in this translation\nwere taken from an American magazine of world-wide reputation editor of\nwhich was not afraid to print of \"damn\" when necessary, by scorning the\ntimid, conventional way of putting it as \"d--n.\" If the propriety of\nprinting such short ugly words be questioned, the translator is sorry to\nsay that no means now exists of directly bringing him to account for he\nmet untimely death on board the Lusitania when it was sunk by the German\nsubmarine.\n\nThanks are due to Mr. J. R. Kennedy, General Manager, and Mr. Henry\nSatoh, Editor-in-Chief, both of the Kokusai Tsushin-sha (the\nInternational News Agency) of Tokyo and a host of personal friends of\nthe translator whose untiring assistance and kind suggestions have made\nthe present translation possible. Without their sympathetic interests,\nthis translation may not have seen the daylight.\n\nTokyo, September, 1918.\n\n\n\nBOTCHAN (MASTER DARLING)\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nBecause of an hereditary recklessness, I have been playing always a\nlosing game since my childhood. During my grammar school days, I was\nonce laid up for about a week by jumping from the second story of the\nschool building. Some may ask why I committed such a rash act. There was\nno particular reason for doing such a thing except I happened to be\nlooking out into the yard from the second floor of the newly-built\nschool house, when one of my classmates, joking, shouted at me; \"Say,\nyou big bluff, I'll bet you can't jump down from there! O, you\nchicken-heart, ha, ha!\" So I jumped down. The janitor of the school had\nto carry me home on his back, and when my father saw me, he yelled\nderisively, \"What a fellow you are to go and get your bones dislocated\nby jumping only from a second story!\"\n\n\"I'll see I don't get dislocated next time,\" I answered.\n\nOne of my relatives once presented me with a pen-knife. I was showing it\nto my friends, reflecting its pretty blades against the rays of the sun,\nwhen one of them chimed in that the blades gleamed all right, but seemed\nrather dull for cutting with.\n\n\"Rather dull? See if they don't cut!\" I retorted.\n\n\"Cut your finger, then,\" he challenged. And with \"Finger nothing! Here\ngoes!\" I cut my thumb slant-wise. Fortunately the knife was small and\nthe bone of the thumb hard enough, so the thumb is still there, but the\nscar will be there until my death.\n\nAbout twenty steps to the east edge of our garden, there was a\nmoderate-sized vegetable yard, rising toward the south, and in the\ncentre of which stood a chestnut tree which was dearer to me than life.\nIn the season when the chestnuts were ripe, I used to slip out of the\nhouse from the back door early in the morning to pick up the chestnuts\nwhich had fallen during the night, and eat them at the school. On the\nwest side of the vegetable yard was the adjoining garden of a pawn shop\ncalled Yamashiro-ya. This shopkeeper's son was a boy about 13 or 14\nyears old named Kantaro. Kantaro was, it happens, a mollycoddle.\nNevertheless he had the temerity to come over the fence to our yard and\nsteal my chestnuts.\n\nOne certain evening I hid myself behind a folding-gate of the fence and\ncaught him in the act. Having his retreat cut off he grappled with me in\ndesperation. He was about two years older than I, and, though\nweak-kneed, was physically the stronger. While I wallopped him, he\npushed his head against my breast and by chance it slipped inside my\nsleeve. As this hindered the free action of my arm, I tried to shake him\nloose, though, his head dangled the further inside, and being no longer\nable to stand the stifling combat, he bit my bare arm. It was painful. I\nheld him fast against the fence, and by a dexterous foot twist sent him\ndown flat on his back. Kantaro broke the fence and as the ground\nbelonging to Yamashiro-ya was about six feet lower than the vegetable\nyard, he fell headlong to his own territory with a thud. As he rolled\noff he tore away the sleeve in which his head had been enwrapped, and my\narm recovered a sudden freedom of movement. That night when my mother\nwent to Yamashiro-ya to apologize, she brought back that sleeve.\n\nBesides the above, I did many other mischiefs. With Kaneko of a\ncarpenter shop and Kaku of a fishmarket, I once ruined a carrot patch of\none Mosaku. The sprouts were just shooting out and the patch was covered\nwith straws to ensure their even healthy growth. Upon this straw-covered\npatch, we three wrestled for fully half a day, and consequently\nthoroughly smashed all the sprouts. Also I once filled up a well which\nwatered some rice fields owned by one Furukawa, and he followed me with\nkicks. The well was so devised that from a large bamboo pole, sunk deep\ninto the ground, the water issued and irrigated the rice fields.\nIgnorant of the mechanical side of this irrigating method at that time,\nI stuffed the bamboo pole with stones and sticks, and satisfied that no\nmore water came up, I returned home and was eating supper when Furukawa,\nfiery red with anger, burst into our house with howling protests. I\nbelieve the affair was settled on our paying for the damage.\n\nFather did not like me in the least, and mother always sided with my big\nbrother. This brother's face was palish white, and he had a fondness for\ntaking the part of an actress at the theatre.\n\n\"This fellow will never amount to much,\" father used to remark when\nhe saw me.\n\n\"He's so reckless that I worry about his future,\" I often heard mother\nsay of me. Exactly; I have never amounted to much. I am just as you see\nme; no wonder my future used to cause anxiety to my mother. I am living\nwithout becoming but a jailbird.\n\nTwo or three days previous to my mother's death, I took it into my head\nto turn a somersault in the kitchen, and painfully hit my ribs against\nthe corner of the stove. Mother was very angry at this and told me not\nto show my face again, so I went to a relative to stay with. While\nthere, I received the news that my mother's illness had become very\nserious, and that after all efforts for her recovery, she was dead. I\ncame home thinking that I should have behaved better if I had known the\nconditions were so serious as that. Then that big brother of mine\ndenounced me as wanting in filial piety, and that I had caused her\nuntimely death. Mortified at this, I slapped his face, and thereupon\nreceived a sound scolding from father.\n\nAfter the death of mother, I lived with father and brother. Father did\nnothing, and always said \"You're no good\" to my face. What he meant by\n\"no good\" I am yet to understand. A funny dad he was. My brother was to\nbe seen studying English hard, saying that he was going to be a\nbusinessman. He was like a girl by nature, and so \"sassy\" that we two\nwere never on good terms, and had to fight it out about once every ten\ndays. When we played a chess game one day, he placed a chessman as a\n\"waiter,\"--a cowardly tactic this,--and had hearty laugh on me by seeing\nme in a fix. His manner was so trying that time that I banged a chessman\non his forehead which was injured a little bit and bled. He told all\nabout this to father, who said he would disinherit me.\n\nThen I gave up myself for lost, and expected to be really disinherited.\nBut our maid Kiyo, who had been with us for ten years or so, interceded\non my behalf, and tearfully apologized for me, and by her appeal my\nfather's wrath was softened. I did not regard him, however, as one to be\nafraid of in any way, but rather felt sorry for our Kiyo. I had heard\nthat Kiyo was of a decent, well-to-do family, but being driven to\npoverty at the time of the Restoration, had to work as a servant. So she\nwas an old woman by this time. This old woman,--by what affinity, as\nthe Buddhists say, I don't know,--loved me a great deal. Strange,\nindeed! She was almost blindly fond of me,--me, whom mother, became\nthoroughly disgusted with three days before her death; whom father\nconsidered a most aggravating proposition all the year round, and whom\nthe neighbors cordially hated as the local bully among the youngsters. I\nhad long reconciled myself to the fact that my nature was far from being\nattractive to others, and so didn't mind if I were treated as a piece of\nwood; so I thought it uncommon that Kiyo should pet me like that.\nSometimes in the kitchen, when there was nobody around, she would praise\nme saying that I was straightforward and of a good disposition. What she\nmeant by that exactly, was not clear to me, however. If I were of so\ngood a nature as she said, I imagined those other than Kiyo should\naccord me a better treatment. So whenever Kiyo said to me anything of\nthe kind, I used to answer that I did not like passing compliments. Then\nshe would remark; \"That's the very reason I say you are of a good\ndisposition,\" and would gaze at me with absorbing tenderness. She seemed\nto recreate me by her own imagination, and was proud of the fact. I felt\neven chilled through my marrow at her constant attention to me.\n\nAfter my mother was dead, Kiyo loved me still more. In my simple\nreasoning, I wondered why she had taken such a fancy to me. Sometimes I\nthought it quite futile on her part, that she had better quit that sort\nof thing, which was bad for her. But she loved me just the same. Once\nin, a while she would buy, out of her own pocket, some cakes or\nsweetmeats for me. When the night was cold, she would secretly buy some\nnoodle powder, and bring all unawares hot noodle gruel to my bed; or\nsometimes she would even buy a bowl of steaming noodles from the\npeddler. Not only with edibles, but she was generous alike with socks,\npencils, note books, etc. And she even furnished me,--this happened some\ntime later,--with about three yen, I did not ask her for the money; she\noffered it from her own good will by bringing it to my room, saying that\nI might be in need of some cash. This, of course, embarrassed me, but as\nshe was so insistent I consented to borrow it. I confess I was really\nglad of the money. I put it in a bag, and carried it in my pocket. While\nabout the house, I happened to drop the bag into a cesspool. Helpless, I\ntold Kiyo how I had lost the money, and at once she fetched a bamboo\nstick, and said she will get it for me. After a while I heard a\nsplashing sound of water about our family well, and going there, saw\nKiyo washing the bag strung on the end of the stick. I opened the bag\nand found the edict of the three one-yen bills turned to faint yellow\nand designs fading. Kiyo dried them at an open fire and handed them over\nto me, asking if they were all right. I smelled them and said; \"They\nstink yet.\"\n\n\"Give them to me; I'll get them changed.\" She took those three bills,\nand,--I do not know how she went about it,--brought three yen in silver.\nI forget now upon what I spent the three yen. \"I'll pay you back soon,\"\nI said at the time, but didn't. I could not now pay it back even if I\nwished to do so with ten times the amount.\n\nWhen Kiyo gave me anything she did so always when both father and\nbrother were out. Many things I do not like, but what I most detest is\nthe monopolizing of favors behind some one else's back. Bad as my\nrelations were with my brother, still I did not feel justified in\naccepting candies or color-pencils from Kiyo without my brother's\nknowledge. \"Why do you give those things only to me and not to my\nbrother also?\" I asked her once, and she answered quite unconcernedly\nthat my brother may be left to himself as his father bought him\neverything. That was partiality; father was obstinate, but I am sure he\nwas not a man who would indulge in favoritism. To Kiyo, however, he\nmight have looked that way. There is no doubt that Kiyo was blind to the\nextent of her undue indulgence with me. She was said to have come from a\nwell-to-do family, but the poor soul was uneducated, and it could not be\nhelped. All the same, you cannot tell how prejudice will drive one to\nthe extremes. Kiyo seemed quite sure that some day I would achieve high\nposition in society and become famous. Equally she was sure that my\nbrother, who was spending his hours studiously, was only good for his\nwhite skin, and would stand no show in the future. Nothing can beat an\nold woman for this sort of thing, I tell you. She firmly believed that\nwhoever she liked would become famous, while whoever she hated would\nnot. I did not have at that time any particular object in my life. But\nthe persistency with which Kiyo declared that I would be a great man\nsome day, made me speculate myself that after all I might become one.\nHow absurd it seems to me now when I recall those days. I asked her once\nwhat kind of a man I should be, but she seemed to have formed no\nconcrete idea as to that; only she said that I was sure to live in a\nhouse with grand entrance hall, and ride in a private rikisha.\n\nAnd Kiyo seemed to have decided for herself to live with me when I\nbecame independent and occupy my own house. \"Please let me live with\nyou,\"--she repeatedly asked of me. Feeling somewhat that I should\neventually be able to own a house, I answered her \"Yes,\" as far as such\nan answer went. This woman, by the way, was strongly imaginative. She\nquestioned me what place I liked,--Kojimachi-ku or Azabu-ku?--and\nsuggested that I should have a swing in our garden, that one room be\nenough for European style, etc., planning everything to suit her own\nfancy. I did not then care a straw for anything like a house; so neither\nJapanese nor European style was much of use to me, and I told her to\nthat effect. Then she would praise me as uncovetous and clean of heart.\nWhatever I said, she had praise for me.\n\nI lived, after the death of mother, in this fashion for five or six\nyears. I had kicks from father, had rows with brother, and had candies\nand praise from Kiyo. I cared for nothing more; I thought this was\nenough. I imagined all other boys were leading about the same kind of\nlife. As Kiyo frequently told me, however, that I was to be pitied, and\nwas unfortunate, I imagined that that might be so. There was nothing\nthat particularly worried me except that father was too tight with my\npocket money, and this was rather hard on me.\n\nIn January of the 6th year after mother's death, father died of\napoplexy. In April of the same year, I graduated from a middle school,\nand two months later, my brother graduated from a business college. Soon\nhe obtained a job in the Kyushu branch of a certain firm and had to go\nthere, while I had to remain in Tokyo and continue my study. He proposed\nthe sale of our house and the realization of our property, to which I\nanswered \"Just as you like it.\" I had no intention of depending upon him\nanyway. Even were he to look after me, I was sure of his starting\nsomething which would eventually end in a smash-up as we were prone to\nquarrel on the least pretext. It was because in order to receive his\nprotection that I should have to bow before such a fellow, that I\nresolved that I would live by myself even if I had to do milk delivery.\nShortly afterwards he sent for a second-hand dealer and sold for a song\nall the bric-a-bric which had been handed down from ages ago in our\nfamily. Our house and lot were sold, through the efforts of a middleman\nto a wealthy person. This transaction seemed to have netted a goodly sum\nto him, but I know nothing as to the detail.\n\nFor one month previous to this, I had been rooming in a boarding house\nin Kanda-ku, pending a decision as to my future course. Kiyo was greatly\ngrieved to see the house in which she had lived so many years change\nownership, but she was helpless in the matter.\n\n\"If you were a little older, you might have inherited this house,\" she\nonce remarked in earnest.\n\nIf I could have inherited the house through being a little older, I\nought to have been able to inherit the house right then. She knew\nnothing, and believed the lack of age only prevented my coming into the\npossession of the house.\n\nThus I parted from my brother, but the disposal of Kiyo was a difficult\nproposition. My brother was, of course, unable to take her along, nor\nwas there any danger of her following him so far away as Kyushu, while I\nwas in a small room of a boarding house, and might have to clear out\nanytime at that. There was no way out, so I asked her if she intended to\nwork somewhere else. Finally she answered me definitely that she would\ngo to her nephew's and wait until I started my own house and get\nmarried. This nephew was a clerk in the Court of Justice, and being\nfairly well off, had invited Kiyo before more than once to come and live\nwith him, but Kiyo preferred to stay with us, even as a servant, since\nshe had become well used to our family. But now I think she thought it\nbetter to go over to her nephew than to start a new life as servant in a\nstrange house. Be that as it may, she advised me to have my own\nhousehold soon, or get married, so she would come and help me in\nhousekeeping. I believe she liked me more than she did her own kin.\n\nMy brother came to me, two days previous to his departure for Kyushu,\nand giving me 600 yen, said that I might begin a business with it, or go\nahead with my study, or spend it in any way I liked, but that that would\nbe the last he could spare. It was a commendable act for my brother.\nWhat! about only 600 yen! I could get along without it, I thought, but\nas this unusually simple manner appealed to me, I accepted the offer\nwith thanks. Then he produced 50 yen, requesting me to give it to Kiyo\nnext time I saw her, which I readily complied with. Two days after, I\nsaw him off at the Shimbashi Station, and have not set my eyes on him\never since.\n\nLying in my bed, I meditated on the best way to spend that 600 yen. A\nbusiness is fraught with too much trouble, and besides it was not my\ncalling. Moreover with only 600 yen no one could open a business worth\nthe name. Were I even able to do it, I was far from being educated, and\nafter all, would lose it. Better let investments alone, but study more\nwith the money. Dividing the 600 yen into three, and by spending 200 yen\na year, I could study for three years. If I kept at one study with\nbull-dog tenacity for three years, I should be able to learn something.\nThen the selection of a school was the next problem. By nature, there is\nno branch of study whatever which appeals to my taste. Nix on languages\nor literature! The new poetry was all Greek to me; I could not make out\none single line of twenty. Since I detested every kind of study, any\nkind of study should have been the same to me. Thinking thus, I happened\nto pass front of a school of physics, and seeing a sign posted for the\nadmittance of more students, I thought this might be a kind of\n\"affinity,\" and having asked for the prospectus, at once filed my\napplication for entrance. When I think of it now, it was a blunder due\nto my hereditary recklessness.\n\nFor three years I studied about as diligently as ordinary fellows, but\nnot being of a particularly brilliant quality, my standing in the class\nwas easier to find by looking up from the bottom. Strange, isn't it,\nthat when three years were over, I graduated? I had to laugh at myself,\nbut there being no reason for complaint, I passed out.\n\nEight days after my graduation, the principal of the school asked me to\ncome over and see him. I wondered what he wanted, and went. A middle\nschool in Shikoku was in need of a teacher of mathematics for forty yen\na month, and he sounded me to see if I would take it. I had studied for\nthree years, but to tell the truth, I had no intention of either\nteaching or going to the country. Having nothing in sight, however,\nexcept teaching, I readily accepted the offer. This too was a blunder\ndue to hereditary recklessness.\n\nI accepted the position, and so must go there. The three years of my\nschool life I had seen confined in a small room, but with no kick coming\nor having no rough house. It was a comparatively easy going period in my\nlife. But now I had to pack up. Once I went to Kamakura on a picnic with\nmy classmates while I was in the grammar school, and that was the first\nand last, so far, that I stepped outside of Tokyo since I could\nremember. This time I must go darn far away, that it beats Kamakura by a\nmile. The prospective town is situated on the coast, and looked the size\nof a needle-point on the map. It would not be much to look at anyway. I\nknew nothing about the place or the people there. It did not worry me or\ncause any anxiety. I had simply to travel there and that was the\nannoying part.\n\nOnce in a while, since our house was no more, I went to Kiyo's\nnephew's to see her. Her nephew was unusually good-natured, and\nwhenever I called upon her, he treated me well if he happened to be at\nhome. Kiyo would boost me sky-high to her nephew right to my face. She\nwent so far once as to say that when I had graduated from school, I\nwould purchase a house somewhere in Kojimachi-ku and get a position in\na government office. She decided everything in her own way, and talked\nof it aloud, and I was made an unwilling and bashful listener. I do\nnot know how her nephew weighed her tales of self-indulgence on me.\nKiyo was a woman of the old type, and seemed, as if it was still the\ndays of Feudal Lords, to regard her nephew equally under obligation to\nme even as she was herself.\n\nAfter settling about my new position, I called upon her three days\nprevious to my departure. She was sick abed in a small room, but, on\nseeing me she got up and immediately inquired;\n\n\"Master Darling, when do you begin housekeeping?\"\n\nShe evidently thought as soon as a fellow finishes school, money comes\nto his pocket by itself. But then how absurd to call such a \"great man\"\n\"Darling.\" I told her simply that I should let the house proposition go\nfor some time, as I had to go to the country. She looked greatly\ndisappointed, and blankly smoothed her gray-haired sidelocks. I felt\nsorry for her, and said comfortingly; \"I am going away but will come\nback soon. I'll return in the vacation next summer, sure.\" Still as she\nappeared not fully satisfied, I added;\n\n\"Will bring you back a surprise. What do you like?\"\n\nShe wished to eat \"sasa-ame\"[1] of Echigo province. I had never heard of\n\"sasa-ame\" of Echigo. To begin with, the location is entirely different.\n\n[Footnote 1: Sasa-ame is a kind of rice-jelly wrapped with sasa, or the\nbamboo leaves, well-known as a product of Echigo province.]\n\n\"There seems to be no 'sasa-ame' in the country where I'm going,\" I\nexplained, and she rejoined; \"Then, in what direction?\" I answered\n\"westward\" and she came back with \"Is it on the other side of Hakone?\"\nThis give-and-take conversation proved too much for me.\n\nOn the day of my departure, she came to my room early in the morning and\nhelped me to pack up. She put into my carpet-bag tooth powder,\ntooth-brush and towels which she said she had bought at a dry goods\nstore on her way. I protested that I did not want them, but she was\ninsistent.[A] We rode in rikishas to the station. Coming up the\nplatform, she gazed at me from outside the car, and said in a low voice;\n\n\"This may be our last good-by. Take care of yourself.\"\n\nHer eyes were full of tears. I did not cry, but was almost going to.\nAfter the train had run some distance, thinking it would be all right\nnow, I poked my head out of the window and looked back. She was still\nthere. She looked very small.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nWith a long, sonorous whistle the steamer which I was aboard came to a\nstandstill, and a boat was seen making toward us from the shore. The man\nrowing the boat was stark naked, except for a piece of red cloth girt\nround his loins. A barbarous place, this! though he may have been\nexcused for it in such hot weather as it was. The sun's rays were strong\nand the water glimmered in such strange colors as to dazzle one's sight\nif gazed at it for long. I had been told by a clerk of the ship that I\nwas to get off here. The place looked like a fishing village about the\nsize of Omori. Great Scott! I wouldn't stay in such a hole, I thought,\nbut I had to get out. So, down I jumped first into the boat, and I think\nfive or six others followed me. After loading about four large boxes\nbesides, the red-cloth rowed us ashore. When the boat struck the sand, I\nwas again the first to jump out, and right away I accosted a skinny\nurchin standing nearby, asking him where the middle school was. The kid\nanswered blankly that he did not know. Confound the dull-head! Not to\nknow where the middle school was, living in such a tiny bit of a town.\nThen a man wearing a rig with short, queer shaped sleeves approached me\nand bade me follow. I walked after him and was taken to an inn called\nMinato-ya. The maids of the inn, who gave me a disagreeable impression,\nchorused at sight of me; \"Please step inside.\" This discouraged me in\nproceeding further, and I asked them, standing at the door-way, to show\nme the middle school. On being told that the middle school was about\nfour miles away by rail, I became still more discouraged at putting up\nthere. I snatched my two valises from the man with queer-shaped [B]\nsleeves who had guided me so far, and strode away. The people of the inn\nlooked after me with a dazed expression.\n\nThe station was easily found, and a ticket bought without any fuss. The\ncoach I got in was about as dignified as a match-box. The train rambled\non for about five minutes, and then I had to get off. No wonder the fare\nwas cheap; it cost only three sen. I then hired a rikisha and arrived at\nthe middle school, but school was already over and nobody was there. The\nteacher on night-duty was out just for a while, said the janitor,--the\nnight-watch was taking life easy, sure. I thought of visiting the\nprincipal, but being tired, ordered the rikishaman to take me to a\nhotel. He did this with much alacrity and led me to a hotel called\nYamashiro-ya. I felt it rather amusing to find the name Yamashiro-ya the\nsame as that of Kantaro's house.\n\nThey ushered me to a dark room below the stairway. No one could stay in\nsuch a hot place! I said I did not like such a warm room, but the maid\ndumped my valises on the floor and left me, mumbling that all the other\nrooms were occupied. So I took the room though it took some resolution\nto stand the weltering heat. After a while the maid said the bath was\nready, and I took one: On my way back from the bathroom, I peeped about,\nand found many rooms, which looked much cooler than mine, vacant.\nSunnovagun! They had lied. By'm-by, she fetched my supper. Although the\nroom was hot, the meal was a deal better than the kind I used to have in\nmy boarding house. While waiting on me, she questioned me where I was\nfrom, and I said, \"from Tokyo.\" Then she asked; \"Isn't Tokyo a nice\nplace?\" and I shot back, \"Bet 'tis.\" About the time the maid had reached\nthe kitchen, loud laughs were heard. There was nothing doing, so I went\nto bed, but could not sleep. Not only was it hot, but noisy,--about five\ntimes noisier than my boarding house. While snoozing, I dreamed of Kiyo.\nShe was eating \"sasa-ame\" of Echigo province without taking off the\nwrapper of bamboo leaves. I tried to stop her, saying bamboo leaves may\ndo her harm, but she replied, \"O, no, these leaves are very helpful for\nthe health,\" and ate them with much relish. Astounded, I laughed \"Ha,\nha, ha!\"--and so awoke. The maid was opening the outside shutters. The\nweather was just as clear as the previous day.\n\nI had heard once before that when travelling, one should give \"tea\nmoney\" to the hotel or inn where he stops; that unless this \"tea\nmoney\" is given, the hostelry would accord him rather rough treatment.\nIt must have been on account of my being slow in the fork over of this\n\"tea money\" that they had huddled me into such a narrow, dark room.\nLikewise my shabby clothes and the carpet bags and satin umbrella must\nhave been accountable for it. Took me for a piker, eh? those hayseeds!\nI would give them a knocker with \"tea money.\" I left Tokyo with about\n30 yen in my pocket, which remained from my school expenses. Taking\noff the railway and steamship fare, and other incidental expenses, I\nhad still about 14 yen in my pocket. I could give them all I\nhad;--what did I care, I was going to get a salary now. All country\nfolk are tight-wads, and one 5-yen bill would hit them square. Now\nwatch and see. Having washed myself, I returned to my room and waited,\nand the maid of the night before brought in my breakfast. Waiting on\nme with a tray, she looked at me with a sort of sulphuric smile. Rude!\nIs any parade marching on my face? I should say. Even my face is far\nbetter than that of the maid. I intended of giving \"tea money\" after\nbreakfast, but I became disgusted, and taking out one 5-yen bill told\nher to take it to the office later. The face of the maid became then\nshy and awkward. After the meal, I left for the school. The maid did\nnot have my shoes polished.\n\nI had had vague idea of the direction of the school as I rode to it the\nprevious day, so turning two or three corners, I came to the front gate.\nFrom the gate to the entrance the walk was paved with granite. When I\nhad passed to the entrance in the rikisha, this walk made so\noutlandishly a loud noise that I had felt coy. On my way to the school,\nI met a number of the students in uniforms of cotton drill and they all\nentered this gate. Some of them were taller than I and looked much\nstronger. When I thought of teaching fellows of this ilk, I was\nimpressed with a queer sort of uneasiness. My card was taken to the\nprincipal, to whose room I was ushered at once. With scant mustache,\ndark-skinned and big-eyed, the principal was a man who looked like a\nbadger. He studiously assumed an air of superiority, and saying he would\nlike to see me do my best, handed the note of appointment, stamped big,\nin a solemn manner. This note I threw away into the sea on my way back\nto Tokyo. He said he would introduce me to all my fellow teachers, and I\nwas to show to each one of them the note of appointment. What a bother!\nIt would be far better to stick this note up in the teachers' room for\nthree days instead of going through such a monkey process.\n\nThe teachers would not be all in the room until the bugle for the first\nhour was sounded. There was plenty of time. The principal took out his\nwatch, and saying that he would acquaint me particularly with the school\nby-and-bye, he would only furnish me now with general matters, and\nstarted a long lecture on the spirit of education. For a while I\nlistened to him with my mind half away somewhere else, but about half\nway through his lecture, I began to realize that I should soon be in a\nbad fix. I could not do, by any means, all he expected of me. He\nexpected that I should make myself an example to the students, should\nbecome an object of admiration for the whole school or should exert my\nmoral influence, besides teaching technical knowledge in order to\nbecome a real educator, or something ridiculously high-sounding. No man\nwith such admirable qualities would come so far away for only 40 yen a\nmonth! Men are generally alike. If one gets excited, one is liable to\nfight, I thought, but if things are to be kept on in the way the\nprincipal says, I could hardly open my mouth to utter anything, nor take\na stroll around the place. If they wanted me to fill such an onerous\npost, they should have told all that before. I hate to tell a lie; I\nwould give it up as having been cheated, and get out of this mess like a\nman there and then. I had only about 9 yen left in my pocket after\ntipping the hotel 5 yen. Nine yen would not take me back to Tokyo. I had\nbetter not have tipped the hotel; what a pity! However, I would be able\nto manage it somehow. I considered it better to run short in my return\nexpenses than to tell a lie.\n\n\"I cannot do it the way you want me to. I return this appointment.\"\n\nI shoved back the note. The principal winked his badger-like eyes and\ngazed at me. Then he said;\n\n\"What I have said just now is what I desire of you. I know well that you\ncannot do all I want, So don't worry.\"\n\nAnd he laughed. If he knew it so well already, what on earth did he\nscare me for?\n\nMeanwhile the bugle sounded, being followed by bustling noises in the\ndirection of the class rooms. All the teachers would be now ready, I was\ntold, and I followed the principal to the teachers' room. In a spacious\nrectangular room, they sat each before a table lined along the walls.\nWhen I entered the room, they all glanced at me as if by previous\nagreement. Did they think my face was for a show? Then, as per\ninstructions, I introduced myself and showed the note to each one of\nthem. Most of them left their chairs and made a slight bow of\nacknowledgment. But some of the more painfully polite took the note and\nread it and respectfully returned it to me, just like the cheap\nperformances at a rural show! When I came to the fifteenth, who was the\nteacher of physical training, I became impatient at repeating the same\nold thing so often. The other side had to do it only once, but my side\nhad to do it fifteen times. They ought to have had some sympathy.\n\nAmong those I met in the room there was Mr. Blank who was head teacher.\nSaid he was a Bachelor of Arts. I suppose he was a great man since he\nwas a graduate from Imperial University and had such a title. He talked\nin a strangely effeminate voice like a woman. But what surprised me most\nwas that he wore a flannel shirt. However thin it might be, flannel is\nflannel and must have been pretty warm at that time of the year. What\npainstaking dress is required which will be becoming to a B.A.! And it\nwas a red shirt; wouldn't that kill you! I heard afterwards that he\nwears a red shirt all the year round. What a strange affliction!\nAccording to his own explanation, he has his shirts made to order for\nthe sake of his health as the red color is beneficial to the physical\ncondition. Unnecessary worry, this, for that being the case, he should\nhave had his coat and hakama also in red. And there was one Mr. Koga,\nteacher of English, whose complexion was very pale. Pale-faced people\nare usually thin, but this man was pale and fat. When I was attending\ngrammar school, there was one Tami Asai in our class, and his father was\njust as pale as this Koga. Asai was a farmer, and I asked Kiyo if one's\nface would become pale if he took up farming. Kiyo said it was not so;\nAsai ate always Hubbard squash of \"uranari\" [2] and that was the reason.\nThereafter when I saw any man pale and fat, I took it for granted that\nit was the result of his having eaten too much of squash of \"uranari.\"\nThis English teacher was surely subsisting upon squash. However, what\nthe meaning of \"uranari\" is, I do not know. I asked Kiyo once, but she\nonly laughed. Probably she did not know. Among the teachers of\nmathematics, there was one named Hotta. This was a fellow of massive\nbody, with hair closely cropped. He looked like one of the old-time\ndevilish priests who made the Eizan temple famous. I showed him the note\npolitely, but he did not even look at it, and blurted out;\n\n\"You're the man newly appointed, eh? Come and see me sometime,\nha, ha, ha!\"\n\n[Footnote 2: Means the last crop.]\n\nDevil take his \"Ha, ha, ha!\" Who would go to see a fellow so void of the\nsense of common decency! I gave this priest from this time the nickname\nof Porcupine.\n\nThe Confucian teacher was strict in his manner as becoming to his\nprofession. \"Arrived yesterday? You must be tired. Start teaching\nalready? Working hard, indeed!\"--and so on. He was an old man, quite\nsociable and talkative.\n\nThe teacher of drawing was altogether like a cheap actor. He wore a\nthin, flappy haori of sukiya, and, toying with a fan, he giggled; \"Where\nfrom? eh? Tokyo? Glad to hear that. You make another of our group. I'm a\nTokyo kid myself.\"\n\nIf such a fellow prided himself on being a Tokyo kid, I wished I had\nnever been born in Tokyo. I might go on writing about each one of\nthem, for there are many, but I stop here otherwise there will be no\nend to it.\n\nWhen my formal introduction was over, the principal said that I might go\nfor the day, but I should make arrangements as to the class hours, etc.,\nwith the head teacher of mathematics and begin teaching from the day\nafter the morrow. Asked who was the head teacher of mathematics, I found\nthat he was no other than that Porcupine. Holy smokes! was I to serve\nunder him? I was disappointed.\n\n\"Say, where are you stopping? Yamashiro-ya? Well, I'll come and\ntalk it over.\"\n\nSo saying, Porcupine, chalk in hand, left the room to his class. That\nwas rather humiliating for a head-teacher to come over and see his\nsubordinate, but it was better than to call me over to him.\n\nAfter leaving the school, I thought of returning straight to the hotel,\nbut as there was nothing to do, I decided to take in a little of the\ntown, and started walking about following my nose. I saw prefectural\nbuilding; it was an old structure of the last century. Also I saw the\nbarracks; they were less imposing than those of the Azabu Regiment,\nTokyo. I passed through the main street. The width of the street is\nabout one half that of Kagurazaka, and its aspect is inferior. What\nabout a castle-town of 250,000-koku Lord! Pity the fellows who get\nswell-headed in such a place as a castle-town!\n\nWhile I walked about musing like this, I found myself in front of\nYamashiro-ya. The town was much narrower than I had been led to believe.\n\n\"I think I have seen nearly all. Guess I'll return and eat.\" And I\nentered the gate. The mistress of the hotel who was sitting at the\ncounter, jumped out of her place at my appearance and with \"Are you\nback, Sire!\" scraped the floor with her forehead. When I took my shoes\noff and stepped inside, the maid took me to an upstairs room that had\nbecame vacant. It was a front room of 15 mats (about 90 square feet). I\nhad never before lived in so splendid a room as this. As it was quite\nuncertain when I should again be able to occupy such a room in future, I\ntook off my European dress, and with only a single Japanese summer coat\non, sprawled in the centre of the room in the shape of the Japanese\nletter \"big\" (arms stretched out and legs spread wide[D]). I found it\nvery refreshing.\n\nAfter luncheon I at once wrote a letter to Kiyo. I hate most to write\nletters because I am poor at sentence-making and also poor in my stock\nof words. Neither did I have any place to which to address my letters.\nHowever, Kiyo might be getting anxious. It would not do to let her worry\nlest she think the steamer which I boarded had been wrecked and I was\ndrowned,--so I braced up and wrote a long one. The body of the letter\nwas as follows:\n\n  \"Arrived yesterday. A dull place. Am sleeping in a room of 15 mats.\n  Tipped the hotel five yen as tea money. The house-wife of the hotel\n  scraped the floor with her forehead. Couldn't sleep last night.\n  Dreamed Kiyo eat sasa-ame together with the bamboo-leaf wrappers. Will\n  return next summer. Went to the school to-day, and nicknamed all the\n  fellows. 'Badger' for the principal, 'Red Shirt' for the head-teacher,\n  'Hubbard Squash' for the teacher of English, 'Porcupine' the teacher\n  of mathematics and 'Clown' for that of drawing. Will write you many\n  other things soon. Good bye.\"\n\nWhen I finished writing the letter, I felt better and sleepy. So I slept\nin the centre of the room, as I had done before, in the letter \"big\"\nshape ([D]). No dream this time, and I had a sound sleep.\n\n\"Is this the room?\"--a loud voice was heard,--a voice which woke me up,\nand Porcupine entered.\n\n\"How do you do? What you have to do in the school----\" he began talking\nshop as soon as I got up and rattled me much. On learning my duties in\nthe school, there seemed to be no difficulty, and I decided to accept.\nIf only such were what was expected of me, I would not be surprised were\nI told to start not only two days hence but even from the following day.\nThe talk on business over, Porcupine said that he did not think it was\nmy intention to stay in such a hotel all the time, that he would find a\nroom for me in a good boarding house, and that I should move.\n\n\"They wouldn't take in another from anybody else but I can do it\nright away. The sooner the better. Go and look at the room to-day,\nmove tomorrow and start teaching from the next day. That'll be all\nnice and settled.\"\n\nHe seemed satisfied by arranging all by himself. Indeed, I should not be\nable to occupy such a room for long. I might have to blow in all of my\nsalary for the hotel bill and yet be short of squaring it. It was pity\nto leave the hotel so soon after I had just shone with a 5-yen tip.\nHowever, it being decidedly convenient to move and get settled early if\nI had to move at all, I asked Porcupine to get that room for me. He told\nme then to come over with him and see the house at any rate, and I did.\nThe house was situated mid-way up a hill at the end of the town, and was\na quiet. The boss was said to be a dealer in antique curios, called\nIkagin, and his wife was about four years his senior. I learned the\nEnglish word \"witch\" when I was in middle school, and this woman looked\nexactly like one. But as she was another man's wife, what did I care if\nshe was a witch. Finally I decided to live in the house from the next\nday. On our way back Porcupine treated me to a cup of ice-water. When I\nfirst met him in the school, I thought him a disgustingly overbearing\nfellow, but judging by the way he had looked after me so far, he\nappeared not so bad after all. Only he seemed, like me, impatient by\nnature and of quick-temper. I heard afterward that he was liked most by\nall the students in the school.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nMy teaching began at last. When I entered the class-room and stepped\nupon the platform for the first time, I felt somewhat strange. While\nlecturing, I wondered if a fellow like me could keep up the profession\nof public instructor. The students were noisy. Once in a while, they\nwould holler \"Teacher!\" \"Teacher,\"--it was \"going some.\" I had been\ncalling others \"teacher\" every day so far, in the school of physics, but\nin calling others \"teacher\" and being called one, there is a wide gap of\ndifference. It made me feel as if some one was tickling my soles. I am\nnot a sneakish fellow, nor a coward; only--it's a pity--I lack audacity.\nIf one calls me \"teacher\" aloud, it gives me a shock similar to that of\nhearing the noon-gun in Marunouchi when I was hungry. The first hour\npassed away in a dashing manner. And it passed away without encountering\nany knotty questions. As I returned to the teachers' room, Porcupine\nasked me how it was. I simply answered \"well,\" and he seemed satisfied.\n\nWhen I left the teachers' room, chalk in hand, for the second hour\nclass, I felt as if I was invading the enemy's territory. On entering\nthe room, I found the students for this hour were all big fellows. I am\na Tokyo kid, delicately built and small, and did not appear very\nimpressive even in my elevated position. If it comes to a scraping, I\ncan hold my own even with wrestlers, but I had no means of appearing\nawe-inspiring[E], merely by the aid of my tongue, to so many as forty\nsuch big chaps before me. Believing, however, that it would set a bad\nprecedent to show these country fellows any weakness, I lectured rather\nloudly and in brusque tone. During the first part the students were\ntaken aback and listened literally with their mouths open. \"That's one\non you!\" I thought. Elated by my success, I kept on in this tone, when\none who looked the strongest, sitting in the middle of the front row,\nstood up suddenly, and called \"Teacher!\" There it goes!--I thought, and\nasked him what it was.\n\n\"A-ah sa-ay, you talk too quick. A-ah ca-an't you make it a leetle slow?\nA-ah?\" \"A-ah ca-an't you?\" \"A-ah?\" was altogether dull.\n\n\"If I talk too fast, I'll make it slow, but I'm a Tokyo fellow, and\ncan't talk the way you do. If you don't understand it, better wait\nuntil you do.\"\n\nSo I answered him. In this way the second hour was closed better than I\nhad expected. Only, as I was about to leave the class, one of the\nstudents asked me, \"A-ah say, won't you please do them for me?\" and\nshowed me some problems in geometry which I was sure I could not solve.\nThis proved to be somewhat a damper on me. But, helpless, I told him I\ncould not make them out, and telling him that I would show him how next\ntime, hastily got out of the room. And all of them raised \"Whee--ee!\"\nSome of them were heard saying \"He doesn't know much.\" Don't take a\nteacher for an encyclopaedia! If I could work out such hard questions as\nthese easily, I would not be in such a backwoods town for forty yen a\nmonth. I returned to the teachers' room.\n\n\"How was it this time?\" asked Porcupine. I said \"Umh.\" But not satisfied\nwith \"Umh\" only, I added that all the students in this school were\nboneheads. He put up a whimsical face.\n\nThe third and the fourth hour and the first hour in the afternoon were\nmore or less the same. In all the classes I attended, I made some kind\nof blunder. I realised that the profession of teaching not quite so easy\na calling as might have appeared. My teaching for the day was finished\nbut I could not get away. I had to wait alone until three o'clock. I\nunderstood that at three o'clock the students of my classes would finish\ncleaning up the rooms and report to me, whereupon I would go over the\nrooms. Then I would run through the students' roll, and then be free to\ngo home. Outrageous, indeed, to keep on chained to the school, staring\nat the empty space when he had nothing more to do, even though he was\n\"bought\" by a salary! Other fellow teachers, however, meekly submitted\nto the regulation, and believing it not well for me,--a new comer--to\nfuss about it, I stood it. On my way home, I appealed to Porcupine as to\nthe absurdity of keeping me there till three o'clock regardless of my\nhaving nothing to do in the school. He said \"Yes\" and laughed. But he\nbecame serious and in an advisory manner told me not to make many\ncomplaints about the school.\n\n\"Talk to me only, if you want to. There are some queer guys around.\"\n\nAs we parted at the next corner, I did not have time to hear more from\nhim.\n\nOn reaching my room, the boss of the house came to me saying, \"Let me\nserve you tea.\" I expected he was going to treat me to some good tea\nsince he said \"Let me serve you,\" but he simply made himself at home\nand drank my own tea. Judging by this, I thought he might be\npractising \"Let me serve you\" during my absence. The boss said that he\nwas fond of antique drawings and curios and finally had decided to\nstart in that business.\n\n\"You look like one quite taken about art. Suppose you begin patronizing\nmy business just for fun as er--connoisseur of art?\"\n\nIt was the least expected kind of solicitation. Two years ago, I went to\nthe Imperial Hotel (Tokyo) on an errand, and I was taken for a\nlocksmith. When I went to see the Daibutsu at Kamakura, haying wrapped\nup myself from head to toe with a blanket, a rikisha man addressed me as\n\"Gov'ner.\" I have been mistaken on many occasions for as many things,\nbut none so far has counted on me as a probable connoisseur of art. One\nshould know better by my appearance. Any one who aspires to be a patron\nof art is usually pictured,--you may see in any drawing,--with either a\nhood on his head, or carrying a tanzaku[3] in his hand. The fellow who\ncalls me a connoisseur of art and pretends to mean it, may be surely as\ncrooked as a dog's hind legs. I told him I did not like such art-stuff,\nwhich is usually favored by retired people. He laughed, and remarking\nthat that nobody liked it at first, but once in it, will find it so\nfascinating that he will hardly get over it, served tea for himself and\ndrank it in a grotesque manner. I may say that I had asked him the night\nbefore to buy some tea for me, but I did not like such a bitter, heavy\nkind. One swallow seemed to act right on my stomach. I told him to buy a\nkind not so bitter as that, and he answered \"All right, Sir,\" and drank\nanother cup. The fellow seemed never to know of having enough of\nanything so long as it was another man's. After he left the room, I\nprepared for the morrow and went to bed.\n\n[Footnote 3: A tanzaku is a long, narrow strip of stiff paper on which a\nJapanese poem is written.]\n\nEveryday thereafter I attended at the school and worked as per\nregulations. Every day on my return, the boss came to my room with the\nsame old \"Let me serve you tea.\" In about a week I understood the school\nin a general way, and had my own idea as to the personality of the boss\nand his wife. I heard from one of my fellow teachers that the first week\nto one month after the receipt of the appointment worried them most as\nto whether they had been favorably received among the students. I never\nfelt anything on that score. Blunders in the class room once in a while\ncaused me chagrin, but in about half an hour everything would clear out\nof my head. I am a fellow who, by nature, can't be worrying long\nabout[F] anything even if I try to. I was absolutely indifferent as how\nmy blunders in the class room affected the students, or how much further\nthey affected the principal or the head-teacher. As I mentioned before,\nI am not a fellow of much audacity to speak of, but I am quick to give\nup anything when I see its finish.\n\nI had resolved to go elsewhere at once if the school did not suit me. In\nconsequence, neither Badger nor Red Shirt wielded any influence over me.\nAnd still less did I feel like coaxing or coddling the youngsters in the\nclass room.\n\nSo far it was O.K. with the school, but not so easy as that at my\nboarding house. I could have stood it if it had been only the boss\ncoming to my room after my tea. But he would fetch many things to my\nroom. First time he brought in seals.[4] He displayed about ten of them\nbefore me and persuaded me to buy them for three yen, which was very\ncheap, he said. Did he take me for a third rate painter making a round\nof the country? I told him I did not want them. Next time he brought in\na panel picture of flowers and birds, drawn by one Kazan or somebody. He\nhung it against the wall of the alcove and asked me if it was not well\ndone, and I echoed it looked well done. Then he started lecturing about\nKazan, that there are two Kazans, one is Kazan something and the other\nis Kazan anything, and that this picture was the work of that Kazan\nsomething. After this nonsensical lecture, he insisted that he would\nmake it fifteen yen for me to buy it. I declined the offer saying that I\nwas shy of the money.\n\n[Footnote 4: Artists have several seals of stone with which to stamp on\nthe picture they draw as a guarantee of their personal work or for\nidentification. The shape and kind of seals are quite a hobby among\nartists, and sales or exchange are of common occurrence.]\n\n\"You can pay any time.\" He was insistent. I settled him by telling him\nof my having no intention of purchasing it even if I had the necessary\nmoney. Again next time, he yanked in a big writing stone slab about the\nsize of a ridge-tile.\n\n\"This is a tankei,\"[5] he said. As he \"tankeied\" two or three times, I\nasked for fun what was a tankei. Right away he commenced lecturing on\nthe subject. \"There are the upper, the middle and the lower stratum in\ntankei,\" he said. \"Most of tankei slabs to-day are made from the upper\nstratum,\" he continued, \"but this one is surely from the middle\nstratum. Look at this 'gan.'[6] 'Tis certainly rare to have three\n'gans' like this. The ink-cake grates smoothly on it. Try it,\nsir,\"--and he pushed it towards me. I asked him how much, and he\nanswered that on account of its owner having brought it from China and\nwishing to sell if as soon as possible, he would make it very cheap,\nthat I could have it for thirty yen. I was sure he was a fool. I seemed\nto be able to get through the school somehow, but I would soon give out\nif this \"curio siege\" kept on long.\n\n[Footnote 5: Tankei is the name of a place in China where a certain kind\nof stone suitable for writing purposes was produced.]\n\n[Footnote 6: \"Gan\" may be understood as a kind of natural mark on the\nstone peculiar to the stone from Tankei.]\n\nShortly afterwards, I began to get sick of the school. One certain\nnight, while I was strolling about a street named Omachi, I happened to\nnotice a sign of noodles below of which was annotated \"Tokyo\" in the\nhouse next to the post office. I am very fond of noodles. While I was in\nTokyo, if I passed by a noodle house and smelled the seasoning spices, I\nfelt uncontrollable temptation to go inside at any cost. Up to this time\nI had forgotten the noodle on account of mathematics and antique curios,\nbut since I had seen thus the sign of noodles, I could hardly pass it by\nunnoticed. So availing myself of this opportunity, I went in. It was not\nquite up to what I had judged by the sign. Since it claimed to follow\nthe Tokyo style, they should have tidied up a little bit about the room.\nThey did not either know Tokyo or have the means,--I did not know which,\nbut the room was miserably dirty. The floor-mats had all seen better\ndays and felt shaggy with sandy dust. The sootcovered walls defied the\nblackest black. The ceiling was not only smoked by the lamp black, but\nwas so low as to force one involuntarily bend down his neck. Only the\nprice-list, on which was glaringly written \"Noodles\" and which was\npasted on the wall, was entirely new. I was certain that they bought an\nold house and opened the business just two or three days before. At the\nhead of the price-list appeared \"tempura\" (noodles served with shrimp\nfried in batter).\n\n\"Say, fetch me some tempura,\" I ordered in a loud voice. Then three\nfellows who had been making a chewing noise together in a corner, looked\nin my direction. As the room was dark I did not notice them at first.\nBut when we looked at each other, I found them all to be boys in our\nschool. They \"how d'ye do'd\" me and I acknowledged it. That night,\nhaving come across the noodle after so long a time, it tasted so fine\nthat I ate four bowls.\n\nThe next day as I entered the class room quite unconcernedly, I saw on\nthe black board written in letters so large as to take up the whole\nspace; \"Professor Tempura.\" The boys all glanced at my face and made\nmerry hee-haws at my cost. It was so absurd that I asked them if it was\nin any way funny for me to eat tempura noodle. Thereupon one of them\nsaid,--\"But four bowls is too much.\" What did they care if I ate four\nbowls or five as long as I paid it with my own money,--and speedily\nfinishing up my class, I returned to the teachers' room. After ten\nminutes' recess, I went to the next class, and there on the black board\nwas newly written quite as large as before; \"Four bowls of tempura\nnoodles, but don't laugh.\"\n\nThe first one did not arouse any ill-temper in me, but this time it made\nme feel irritating mad. A joke carried too far becomes mischievous. It\nis like the undue jealousy of some women who, like coal, look black and\nsuggest flames. Nobody likes it. These country simpletons, unable to\ndifferentiate upon so delicate a boundary, would seem to be bent on\npushing everything to the limit. As they lived in such a narrow town\nwhere one has no more to see if he goes on strolling about for one hour,\nand as they were capable of doing nothing better, they were trumpeting\naloud this tempura incident in quite as serious a manner as the\nRusso-Japanese war. What a bunch of miserable pups! It is because they\nare raised in this fashion from their boyhood that there are many punies\nwho, like the dwarf maple tree in the flower pot, mature gnarled and\ntwisted. I have no objection to laugh myself with others over innocent\njokes. But how's this? Boys as they are, they showed a \"poisonous\ntemper.\" Silently erasing off \"tempura\" from the board, I questioned\nthem if they thought such mischief interesting, that this was a cowardly\njoke and if they knew the meaning of \"cowardice.\" Some of them answered\nthat to get angry on being laughed at over one's own doing, was\ncowardice. What made them so disgusting as this? I pitied myself for\ncoming from far off Tokyo to teach such a lot.\n\n\"Keep your mouth shut, and study hard,\" I snapped, and started the\nclass. In the next class again there was written: \"When one eats tempura\nnoodles it makes him drawl nonsense.\" There seemed no end to it. I was\nthoroughly aroused with anger, and declaring that I would not teach such\nsassies, went home straight. The boys were glad of having an unexpected\nholiday, so I heard. When things had come to this pass, the antique\ncurious seemed far more preferable to the school.\n\nMy return home and sleep over night greatly rounded off my rugged temper\nover the tempura affair. I went to the school, and they were there also.\nI could not tell what was what. The three days thereafter were pacific,\nand on the night of the fourth day, I went to a suburb called Sumida and\nate \"dango\" (small balls made of glutinous rice, dressed with\nsugar-paste). Sumida is a town where there are restaurants, hot-springs\nbath houses and a park, and in addition, the \"tenderloin.\" The dango\nshop where I went was near the entrance to the tenderloin, and as the\ndango served there was widely known for its nice taste, I dropped in on\nmy way back from my bath. As I did not meet any students this time, I\nthought nobody knew of it, but when I entered the first hour class next\nday, I found written on the black board; \"Two dishes of dango--7 sen.\"\nIt is true that I ate two dishes and paid seven sen. Troublesome kids! I\ndeclare. I expected with certainty that there would be something at the\nsecond hour, and there it was; \"The dango in the tenderloin taste fine.\"\nStupid wretches!\n\nNo sooner I thought, the dango incident closed than the red towel became\nthe topic for widespread gossip. Inquiry as to the story revealed it to\nbe something unusually absurd. Since, my arrival here, I had made it a\npart of my routine to take in the hot springs bath every day. While\nthere was nothing in this town which compared favorably with Tokyo, the\nhot springs were worthy of praise. So long as I was in the town, I\ndecided that I would have a dip every day, and went there walking,\npartly for physical exercise, before my supper. And whenever I went\nthere I used to carry a large-size European towel dangling from my hand.\nAdded to somewhat reddish color the towel had acquired by its having\nbeen soaked in the hot-springs, the red color on its border, which was\nnot fast enough, streaked about so that the towel now looked as if it\nwere dyed red. This towel hung down from my hand on both ways whether\nafoot or riding in the train. For this reason, the students nicknamed me\nRed Towel. Honest, it is exasperating to live in a little town.\n\nThere is some more. The bath house I patronized was a newly built\nthree-story house, and for the patrons of the first class the house\nprovided a bath-robe, in addition to an attendant, and the cost was only\neight sen. On top of that, a maid would serve tea in a regular polite\nfashion. I always paid the first class. Then those gossipy spotters\nstarted saying that for one who made only forty yen a month to take a\nfirst class bath every day was extravagant. Why the devil should they\ncare? It was none of their business.\n\nThere is still some more. The bath-tub,--or the tank in this case,--was\nbuilt of granite, and measured about thirty square feet. Usually there\nwere thirteen or fourteen people in the tank, but sometimes there was\nnone. As the water came up clear to the breast, I enjoyed, for athletic\npurposes, swimming in the tank. I delighted in swimming in this\n30-square feet tank, taking chances of the total absence of other\npeople. Once, going downstairs from the third story with a light heart,\nand peeping through the entrance of the tank to see if I should be able\nto swim, I noticed a sign put up in which was boldly written: \"No\nswimming allowed in the tank.\" As there may not have been many who swam\nin the tank, this notice was probably put up particularly for my sake.\nAfter that I gave up swimming. But although I gave up swimming, I was\nsurprised, when I went to the school, to see on the board, as usual,\nwritten: \"No swimming allowed in the tank.\" It seemed as if all the\nstudents united in tracking me everywhere. They made me sick. I was not\na fellow to stop doing whatever I had started upon no matter what\nstudents might say, but I became thoroughly disgusted when I meditated\non why I had come to such a narrow, suffocating place. And, then, when I\nreturned home, the \"antique curio siege\" was still going on.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nFor us teachers there was a duty of night watch in the school, and we\nhad to do it in turn. But Badger and Red Shirt were not in it. On\nasking why these two were exempt from this duty, I was told that they\nwere accorded by the government treatment similar to officials of\n\"Sonin\" rank. Oh, fudge! They were paid more, worked less, and were\nthen excused from this night watch. It was not fair. They made\nregulations to suit their convenience and seemed to regard all this as\na matter of course. How could they be so brazen faced as this! I was\ngreatly dissatisfied relative to this question, but according to the\nopinion of Porcupine, protests by a single person, with what insistency\nthey may be made, will not be heard. They ought to be heard whether\nthey are made by one person or by two if they are just. Porcupine\nremonstrated with me by quoting \"Might is right\" in English. I did not\ncatch his point, so I asked him again, and he told me that it meant the\nright of the stronger. If it was the right of the stronger I had known\nit for long, and did not require Porcupine explain that to me at this\ntime. The right of the stronger was a question different from that of\nthe night watch. Who would agree that Badger and Red Shirt were the\nstronger? But argument or no argument, the turn of this night watch at\nlast fell upon me. Being quite fastidious, I never enjoyed sound sleep\nunless I slept comfortably in my own bedding. From my childhood, I\nnever stayed out overnight. When I did not find sleeping under the roof\nof my friends inviting, night watch in the school, you may be sure, was\nstill worse. However repulsive, if this was a part of the forty yen a\nmonth, there was no alternative. I had to do it.\n\nTo remain alone in the school after the faculty and students had gone\nhome, was something particularly awkward. The room for the night watch\nwas in the rear of the school building at the west end of the dormitory.\nI stepped inside to see how it was, and finding it squarely facing the\nsetting sun, I thought I would melt. In spite of autumn having already\nset in, the hot spell still lingered, quite in keeping with the\ndilly-dally atmosphere of the country. I ordered the same kind of meal\nas served for the students, and finished my supper. The meal was\nunspeakably poor. It was a wonder they could subsist on such miserable\nstuff and keep on \"roughing it\" in that lively fashion. Not only that,\nthey were always hungry for supper, finishing it at 4.30 in the\nafternoon. They must be heroes in a sense. I had thus my supper, but the\nsun being still high, could not go to bed yet. I felt like going to the\nhot-springs. I did not know the wrong or right of night watch going out,\nbut it was oppressively trying to stand a life akin to heavy\nimprisonment. When I called at the school the first time and inquired\nabout night watch, I was told by the janitor that he had just gone out\nand I thought it strange. But now by taking the turn of night watch\nmyself, I could fathom the situation; it was right for any night watch\nto go out. I told the janitor that I was going out for a minute. He\nasked me \"on business?\" and I answered \"No,\" but to take a bath at the\nhot springs, and went out straight. It was too bad that I had left my\nred towel at home, but I would borrow one over there for to-day.\n\nI took plenty of time in dipping in the bath and as it became dark at\nlast, I came to the Furumachi Station on a train. It was only about four\nblocks to the school; I could cover it in no time. When I started\nwalking schoolwards, Badger was seen coming from the opposite direction.\nBadger, I presumed, was going to the hot springs by this train. He came\nwith brisk steps, and as we passed by, I nodded my courtesy. Then\nBadger, with a studiously owlish countenance, asked:\n\n\"Am I wrong to understand that you are night watch?\"\n\nChuck that \"Am-I-wrong-to-understand\"! Two hours ago, did he not say to\nme \"You're on first night watch to-night. Now, take care of yourself?\"\nWhat makes one use such a roundabout, twisted way of saying anything\nwhen he becomes a principal? I was far from smiling.\n\n\"Yes, Sir,\" I said, \"I'm night watch to-night, and as I am night watch I\nwill return to the school and stay there overnight, sure.\" With this\nparting shot, I left him where we met. Coming then to the cross-streets\nof Katamachi, I met Porcupine. This is a narrow place, I tell you.\nWhenever one ventures out, he is sure to come across some familiar face.\n\n\"Say, aren't you night watch?\" he hallooed, and I said \"Yes, I am.\" \"Tis\nwrong for night watch to leave his post at his pleasure,\" he added, and\nto this I blurted out with a bold front; \"Nothing wrong at all. It is\nwrong not to go out.\"\n\n\"Say, old man, your slap-dash is going to the limit. Wouldn't look well\nfor the principal or the head teacher to see you out like this.\"\n\nThe submissive tone of his remark was contrary to Porcupine as I had\nknown him so far, so I cut him short by saying:\n\n\"I have met the principal just now. Why, he approved my taking a stroll\nabout the town. Said it would be hard on night watch unless he took a\nwalk when it is hot.\" Then I made a bee-line for the school.\n\nSoon it was night. I called the janitor to my room and had a chat for\nabout two hours. I grew tired of this, and thought I would get into bed\nanyway, even if I could not sleep. I put on my night shirt, lifted the\nmosquito-net, rolled off the red blanket and fell down flat on my back\nwith a bang. The making of this bumping noise when I go to bed is my\nhabit from my boyhood. \"It is a bad habit,\" once declared a student of a\nlaw school who lived on the ground floor, and I on the second, when I\nwas in the boarding house at Ogawa-machi, Kanda-ku, and who brought\ncomplaints to my room in person. Students of law schools, weaklings as\nthey are, have double the ability of ordinary persons when it comes to\ntalking. As this student of law dwelt long on absurd accusations, I\ndowned him by answering that the noise made when I went to bed was not\nthe fault of my hip, but that of the house which was not built on a\nsolid base, and that if he had any fuss to make, make it to the house,\nnot to me. This room for night watch was not on the second floor, so\nnobody cared how much I banged. I do not feel well-rested unless I go to\nbed with the loudest bang I can make.\n\n\"This is bully!\" and I straightened out my feet, when something jumped\nand clung to them. They felt coarse, and seemed not to be fleas. I was a\nbit surprised, and shook my feet inside the blanket two or three times.\nInstantly the blamed thing increased,--five or six of them on my legs,\ntwo or three on the thighs, one crushed beneath my hip and another clear\nup to my belly. The shock became greater. Up I jumped, took off the\nblanket, and about fifty to sixty grasshoppers flew out. I was more or\nless uneasy until I found out what they were, but now I saw they were\ngrasshoppers, they set me on the war path. \"You insignificant\ngrasshoppers, startling a man! See what's coming to you!\" With this I\nslapped them with my pillow twice or thrice, but the objects being so\nsmall, the effect was out of proportion to the force with which the\nblows were administered. I adopted a different plan. In the manner of\nbeating floor-mats with rolled matting at house-cleaning, I sat up in\nbed and began beating them with the pillow. Many of them flew up by the\nforce of the pillow; some desperately clung on or shot against my nose\nor head. I could not very well hit those on my head with the pillow; I\ngrabbed such, and dashed them on the floor. What was more provoking was\nthat no matter how hard I dashed them, they landed on the mosquito-net\nwhere they made a fluffy jerk and remained, far from being dead. At\nlast, in about half an hour the slaughter of the grasshoppers was ended.\nI fetched a broom and swept them out. The janitor came along and asked\nwhat was the matter.\n\n\"Damn the matter! Where in thunder are the fools who keep grasshoppers\nin bed! You pumpkinhead!\"\n\nThe janitor answered by explaining that he did not know anything about\nit. \"You can't get away with Did-not-know,\" and I followed this\nthundering by throwing away the broom. The awe-struck janitor shouldered\nthe broom and faded away.\n\nAt once I summoned three of the students to my room as the\n\"representatives,\" and six of them reported. Six or ten made no\ndifference; I rolled up the sleeves of my night-shirt and fired away.\n\n\"What do you mean by putting grasshoppers in my bed!\"\n\n\"Grasshoppers? What are they?\" said one in front, in a tone disgustingly\nquiet. In this school, not only the principal, but the students as well,\nwere addicted to using twisted-round expressions.\n\n\"Don't know grasshoppers! You shall see!\" To my chagrin, there was none;\nI had swept them all out. I called the janitor again and told him to\nfetch those grasshoppers he had taken away. The janitor said he had\nthrown them into the garbage box, but that he would pick them out again.\n\"Yes, hurry up,\" I said, and he sped away. After a while he brought back\nabout ten grasshoppers on a white paper, remarking:\n\n\"I'm sorry, Sir. It's dark outside and I can't find out more. I'll find\nsome tomorrow.\" All fools here, down to the janitor. I showed one\ngrasshopper to the students.\n\n\"This is a grasshopper. What's the matter for as big idiots as you not\nto know a grasshopper.\" Then the one with a round face sitting on the\nleft saucily shot back:\n\n\"A-ah say, that's a locust, a-ah----.\"\n\n\"Shut up. They're the same thing. In the first place, what do you\nmean by answering your teacher 'A-ah say'? Ah-Say or Ah-Sing is a\nChink's name!\"\n\nFor this counter-shot, he answered:\n\n\"A-ah say and Ah-Sing is different,--A-ah say.\" They never got rid of\n\"A-ah say.\"\n\n\"Grasshoppers or locusts, why did you put them into my bed? When I\nasked you to?\"\n\n\"Nobody put them in.\"\n\n\"If not, how could they get into the bed?\"\n\n\"Locusts are fond of warm places and probably they got in there\nrespectfully by themselves.\"\n\n\"You fools! Grasshoppers getting into bed respectfully! I should smile\nat them getting in there respectfully! Now, what's the reason for doing\nthis mischief? Speak out.\"\n\n\"But there is no way to explain it because we didn't do it.\"\n\nShrimps! If they were afraid of making a clean breast of their own deed,\nthey should not have done it at all. They looked defiant, and appeared\nto insist on their innocence as long as no evidence was brought up. I\nmyself did some mischief while in the middle school, but when the\nculprit was sought after, I was never so cowardly, not even once, to\nback out. What one has done, has been done; what he has not, has not\nbeen,--that's the black and white of it. I, for one have been game and\nsquare, no matter how much mischief I might have done. If I wished to\ndodge the punishment, I would not start it. Mischief and punishment are\nbound to go together. We can enjoy mischief-making with some show of\nspirit because it is accompanied by certain consequences. Where does one\nexpect to see the dastardly spirit which hungers for mischief-making\nwithout punishment, in vogue? The fellows who like to borrow money but\nnot pay it back, are surely such as these students here after they are\ngraduated. What did these fellows come to this middle school for,\nanyway? They enter a school, tattle round lies, play silly jokes behind\nsome one by sneaking and cheating and get wrongly swell-headed when they\nfinish the school thinking they have received an education. A common lot\nof jackasses they are.\n\nMy hatred of talking with these scamps became intense, so I dismissed\nthem by saying:\n\n\"If you fellows have nothing to say, let it go at that. You deserve\npity for not knowing the decent from the vulgar after coming to a\nmiddle school.\"\n\nI am not very decent in my own language or manner, but am sure that my\nmoral standard is far more decent than that of these gangs. Those six\nboys filed out leisurely. Outwardly they appeared more dignified than I\ntheir teacher, it was the more repulsive for their calm behavior. I have\nno temerity equal to theirs. Then I went to bed again, and found the\ninside of the net full of merry crowds of mosquitoes. I could not bother\nmyself to burn one by one with a candle flame. So I took the net off the\nhooks, folded it the lengthwise, and shook it crossways, up and down the\nroom. One of the rings of the net, flying round, accidentally hit the\nback of my hand, the effect of which I did not soon forget. When I went\nto bed for the third time, I cooled off a little, but could not sleep\neasily. My watch showed it was half past ten. Well, as I thought it\nover, I realized myself as having come to a dirty pit. If all teachers\nof middle schools everywhere have to handle fellows like these in this\nschool, those teachers have my sympathy. It is wonderful that teachers\nnever run short. I believe there are many boneheads of extraordinary\npatience; but me for something else. In this respect, Kiyo is worthy of\nadmiration. She is an old woman, with neither education nor social\nposition, but as a human, she does more to command our respect. Until\nnow, I have been a trouble to her without appreciating her goodness, but\nhaving come alone to such a far-off country, I now appreciated, for the\nfirst time, her kindness. If she is fond of sasa-ame of Echigo province,\nand if I go to Echigo for the purpose of buying that sweetmeat to let\nher eat it, she is fully worth that trouble. Kiyo has been praising me\nas unselfish and straight, but she is a person of sterling qualities far\nmore than I whom she praises. I began to feel like meeting her.\n\nWhile I was thus meditating about Kiyo, all of a sudden, on the floor\nabove my head, about thirty to forty people, if I guess by the number,\nstarted stamping the floor with bang, bang, bang that well threatened to\nbang down the floor. This was followed by proportionately loud whoops.\nThe noise surprised me, and I popped up. The moment I got up I became\naware that the students were starting a rough house to get even with me.\nWhat wrong one has committed, he has to confess, or his offence is never\natoned for. They are just to ask for themselves what crimes they have\ndone. It should be proper that they repent their folly after going to\nbed and to come and beg me pardon the next morning. Even if they could\nnot go so far as to apologize they should have kept quiet. Then what\ndoes this racket mean? Where we keeping hogs in our dormitory?\n\n\"This crazy thing got to stop. See what you get!\"\n\nI ran out of the room in my night shirt, and flew upstairs in three and\nhalf steps. Then, strange to say, thunderous rumbling, of which I was\nsure of hearing in the act, was hushed. Not only a whisper but even\nfootsteps were not heard. This was funny. The lamp was already blown\nout and although I could not see what was what in the dark, nevertheless\ncould tell by instinct whether there was somebody around or not. In the\nlong corridor running from the east to the west, there was not hiding\neven a mouse. From other end of the corridor the moonlight flooded in\nand about there it was particularly light. The scene was somewhat\nuncanny. I have had the habit from my boyhood of frequently dreaming and\nof flying out of bed and of muttering things which nobody understood,\naffording everybody a hearty laugh. One night, when I was sixteen or\nseventeen, I dreamed that I picked up a diamond, and getting up,\ndemanded of my brother who was sleeping close to me what he had done\nwith that diamond. The demand was made with such force that for about\nthree days all in the house chaffed me about the fatal loss of precious\nstone, much to my humiliation. Maybe this noise which I heard was but a\ndream, although I was sure it was real. I was wondering thus in the\nmiddle of the corridor, when at the further end where it was moonlit, a\nroar was raised, coming from about thirty or forty throats, \"One, two,\nthree,--Whee-ee!\" The roar had hardly subsided, when, as before, the\nstamping of the floor commenced with furious rhythm. Ah, it was not a\ndream, but a real thing!\n\n\"Quit making the noise! 'Tis midnight!\"\n\nI shouted to beat the band, and started in their direction. My passage\nwas dark; the moonlight yonder was only my guide. About twelve feet\npast, I stumbled squarely against some hard object; ere the \"Ouch!\" has\npassed clear up to my head, I was thrown down. I called all kinds of\ngods, but could not run. My mind urged me on to hurry up, but my leg\nwould not obey the command. Growing impatient, I hobbled on one foot,\nand found both voice and stamping already ceased and perfectly quiet.\nMen can be cowards but I never expected them capable of becoming such\ndastardly cowards as this. They challenged hogs.\n\nNow the situation having developed to this pretty mess, I would not give\nit up until I had dragged them out from hiding and forced them to\napologize. With this determination, I tried to open one of the doors and\nexamine inside, but it would not open. It was locked or held fast with a\npile of tables or something; to my persistent efforts the door stood\nunyielding. Then I tried one across the corridor on the northside, but\nit was also locked. While this irritating attempt at door-opening was\ngoing on, again on the east end of the corridor the whooping roar and\nrhythmic stamping of feet were heard. The fools at both ends were bent\non making a goose of me. I realized this, but then I was at a loss what\nto do. I frankly confess that I have not quite as much tact as dashing\nspirit. In such a case I am wholly at the mercy of swaying circumstances\nwithout my own way of getting through it. Nevertheless, I do not expect\nto play the part of underdog. If I dropped the affair then and there, it\nwould reflect upon my dignity. It would be mortifying to have them think\nthat they had one on the Tokyo-kid and that Tokyo-kid was wanting in\ntenacity. To have it on record that I had been guyed by these\ninsignificant spawn when on night watch, and had to give in to their\nimpudence because I could not handle them,--this would be an indelible\ndisgrace on my life. Mark ye,--I am descendant of a samurai of the\n\"hatamato\" class. The blood of the \"hatamoto\" samurai could be traced to\nMitsunaka Tada, who in turn could claim still a nobler ancestor. I am\ndifferent from, and nobler than, these manure-smelling louts. The only\npity is that I am rather short of tact; that I do not know what to do in\nsuch a case. That is the trouble. But I would not throw up the sponge;\nnot on your life! I only do not know how because I am honest. Just\nthink,--if the honest does not win, what else is there in this world\nthat will win? If I cannot beat them to-night, I will tomorrow; if not\ntomorrow, then the day after tomorrow. If not the day after tomorrow, I\nwill sit down right here, get my meals from my home until I beat them.\n\nThus resolved, I squatted in the middle of the corridor and waited for\nthe dawn. Myriads of mosquitoes swarmed about me, but I did not mind\nthem. I felt my leg where I hit it a while ago; it seemed bespattered\nwith something greasy. I thought it was bleeding. Let it bleed all it\ncares! Meanwhile, exhausted by these unwonted affairs, I fell asleep.\nWhen I awoke, up I jumped with a curse. The door on my right was half\nopened, and two students were standing in front of me. The moment I\nrecovered my senses from the drowsy lull, I grabbed a leg of one of them\nnearest to me, and yanked it with all my might. He fell down prone. Look\nat what you're getting now! I flew at the other fellow, who was much\nconfused; gave him vigorous shaking twice or thrice, and he only kept\nopen his bewildering eyes.\n\n\"Come up to my room.\" Evidently they were mollycoddles, for they obeyed\nmy command without a murmur. The day had become already clear.\n\nI began questioning those two in my room, but,--you cannot pound out the\nleopard's spots no matter how you may try,--they seemed determined to\npush it through by an insistent declaration of \"not guilty,\" that they\nwould not confess. While this questioning was going on, the students\nupstairs came down, one by one, and began congregating in my room. I\nnoticed all their eyes were swollen from want of sleep.\n\n\"Blooming nice faces you got for not sleeping only one night. And you\ncall yourselves men! Go, wash your face and come back to hear what I've\ngot to tell you.\"\n\nI hurled this shot at them, but none of them went to wash his face. For\nabout one hour, I had been talking and back-talking with about fifty\nstudents when suddenly Badger put in his appearance. I heard afterward\nthat the janitor ran to Badger for the purpose of reporting to him that\nthere was a trouble in the school. What a weak-knee of the janitor to\nfetch the principal for so trifling an affair as this! No wonder he\ncannot see better times than a janitor.\n\nThe principal listened to my explanation, and also to brief remarks from\nthe students. \"Attend school as usual till further notice. Hurry up with\nwashing your face and breakfast; there isn't much time left.\" So the\nprincipal let go all the students. Decidedly slow way of handling, this.\nIf I were the principal, I would expel them right away. It is because\nthe school accords them such luke-warm treatment that they get \"fresh\"\nand start \"guying\" the night watch.\n\nHe said to me that it must have been trying on my nerves, and that\nI might be tired, and also that I need not teach that day. To this\nI replied:\n\n\"No, Sir, no worrying at all. Such things may happen every night,\nbut it would not disturb me in the least as long as I breathe. I\nwill do the teaching. If I were not able to teach on account of lack\nof sleep for only one single night, I would make a rebate of my\nsalary to the school.\"\n\nI do not know how this impressed him, but he gazed at me for a while,\nand called my attention to the fact that my face was rather swollen.\nIndeed, I felt it heavy. Besides, it itched all over. I was sure the\nmosquitoes must have stung me there to their hearts' content. I\nfurther added:\n\n\"My face may be swollen, but I can talk all right; so I will teach;\"\nthus scratching my face with some warmth. The principal smiled and\nremarked, \"Well, you have the strength.\" To tell the truth, he did not\nintend remark to be a compliment, but, I think, a sneer.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\n\"Won't you go fishing?\" asked Red Shirt He talks in a strangely womanish\nvoice. One would not be able to tell whether he was a man or a woman. As\na man he should talk like one. Is he not a college graduate? I can talk\nman-like enough, and am a graduate from a school of physics at that. It\nis a shame for a B.A. to have such a squeak.\n\nI answered with the smallest enthusiasm, whereupon he further asked me\nan impolite question if I ever did fishing. I told him not much, that I\nonce caught three gibels when I was a boy, at a fishing game pond at\nKoume, and that I also caught a carp about eight inches long, at a\nsimilar game at the festival of Bishamon at Kagurazaka;--the carp, just\nas I was coaxing it out of the water, splashed back into it, and when I\nthink of the incident I feel mortified at the loss even now. Red Shirt\nstuck out his chin and laughed \"ho, ho.\" Why could he not laugh just\nlike an ordinary person? \"Then you are not well acquainted with the\nspirit of the game,\" he cried. \"I'll show you if you like.\" He seemed\nhighly elated.\n\nNot for me! I take it this way that generally those who are fond of\nfishing or shooting have cruel hearts. Otherwise, there is no reason why\nthey could derive pleasure in murdering innocent creatures. Surely, fish\nand birds would prefer living to getting killed. Except those who make\nfishing or shooting their calling, it is nonsense for those who are well\noff to say that they cannot sleep well unless they seek the lives of\nfish or birds. This was the way I looked at the question, but as he was\na B. A. and would have a better command of language when it came to\ntalking, I kept mum, knowing he would beat me in argument. Red Shirt\nmistook my silence for my surrender, and began to induce me to join him\nright away, saying he would show me some fish and I should come with him\nif I was not busy, because he and Mr. Yoshikawa were lonesome when\nalone. Mr. Yoshikawa is the teacher of drawing whom I had nicknamed\nClown. I don't know what's in the mind of this Clown, but he was a\nconstant visitor at the house of Red Shirt, and wherever he went, Clown\nwas sure to be trailing after him. They appeared more like master and\nservant than two fellow teachers. As Clown used to follow Red Shirt like\na shadow, it would be natural to see them go off together now, but when\nthose two alone would have been well off, why should they invite\nme,--this brusque, unaesthetic fellow,--was hard to understand.\nProbably, vain of his fishing ability, he desired to show his skill, but\nhe aimed at the wrong mark, if that was his intention, as nothing of the\nkind would touch me. I would not be chagrined if he fishes out two or\nthree tunnies. I am a man myself and poor though I may be in the art, I\nwould hook something if I dropped a line. If I declined his invitation,\nRed Shirt would suspect that I refused not because of my lack of\ninterest in the game but because of my want of skill of fishing. I\nweighed the matter thus, and accepted his invitation. After the school,\nI returned home and got ready, and having joined Red Shirt and Clown at\nthe station, we three started to the shore. There was only one boatman\nto row; the boat was long and narrow, a kind we do not have in Tokyo. I\nlooked for fishing rods but could find none.\n\n\"How can we fish without rods? How are we going to manage it?\" I asked\nClown and he told me with the air of a professional fisherman that no\nrods were needed in the deep-sea fishing, but only lines. I had better\nnot asked him if I was to be talked down in this way.\n\nThe boatman was rowing very slowly, but his skill was something\nwonderful. We had already come far out to sea, and on turning back, saw\nthe shore minimized, fading in far distance. The five-storied pagoda of\nTosho Temple appeared above the surrounding woods like a needle-point.\nYonder stood Aoshima (Blue Island). Nobody was living on this island\nwhich a closer view showed to be covered with stones and pine trees. No\nwonder no one could live there. Red Shirt was intently surveying about\nand praising the general view as fine. Clown also termed it \"an\nabsolutely fine view.\" I don't know whether it is so fine as to be\nabsolute, but there was no doubt as to the exhilarating air. I realized\nit as the best tonic to be thus blown by the fresh sea breeze upon a\nwide expanse of water. I felt hungry.\n\n\"Look at that pine; its trunk is straight and spreads its top branches\nlike an umbrella. Isn't it a Turnersque picture?\" said Red Shirt. \"Yes,\njust like Turner's,\" responded Clown, \"Isn't the way it curves just\nelegant? Exactly the touch of Turner,\" he added with some show of pride.\nI didn't know what Turner was, but as I could get along without knowing\nit, I kept silent. The boat turned to the left with the island on the\nright. The sea was so perfectly calm as to tempt one to think he was not\non the deep sea. The pleasant occasion was a credit to Red Shirt. As I\nwished, if possible, to land on the island, I asked the boatman if our\nboat could not be made to it. Upon this Red Shirt objected, saying that\nwe could do so but it was not advisable to go too close the shore for\nfishing. I kept still for a while. Then Clown made the unlooked-for\nproposal that the island be named Turner Island. \"That's good; We shall\ncall it so hereafter,\" seconded Red Shirt. If I was included in that\n\"We,\" it was something I least cared for. Aoshima was good enough for\nme. \"By the way, how would it look,\" said Clown, \"if we place Madonna by\nRaphael upon that rock? It would make a fine picture.\"\n\n\"Let's quit talking about Madonna, ho, ho, ho,\" and Red Shirt emitted a\nspooky laugh.\n\n\"That's all right. Nobody's around,\" remarked Clown as he glanced at me,\nand turning his face to other direction significantly, smiled\ndevilishly. I felt sickened.\n\nAs it was none of my business whether it was a Madonna or a kodanna\n(young master), they let pose there any old way, but it was vulgar to\nfeign assurance that one's subject is in no danger of being understood\nso long as others did not know the subject. Clown claims himself as a\nYedo kid. I thought that the person called Madonna was no other than a\nfavorite geisha of Red Shirt. I should smile at the idea of his gazing\nat his tootsy-wootsy standing beneath a pine tree. It would be better\nif Clown would make an oil painting of the scene and exhibit it for\nthe public.\n\n\"This will be about the best place.\" So saying the boatman stopped\nrowing the boat and dropped an anchor.\n\n\"How deep is it?\" asked Red Shirt, and was told about six fathoms.\n\n\"Hard to fish sea-breams in six fathoms,\" said Red Shirt as he dropped a\nline into the water. The old sport appeared to expect to fetch some\nbream. Bravo!\n\n\"It wouldn't be hard for you. Besides it is calm,\" Clown fawningly\nremarked, and he too dropped a line. The line had only a tiny bit of\nlead that looked like a weight. It had no float. To fish without a float\nseemed as nearly reasonable as to measure the heat without a\nthermometer, which was something impossible for me. So I looked on. They\nthen told me to start, and asked me if I had any line. I told them I had\nmore than I could use, but that I had no float.\n\n\"To say that one is unable to fish without a float shows that he is a\nnovice,\" piped up Clown.\n\n\"See? When the line touches the bottom, you just manage it with your\nfinger on the edge. If a fish bites, you could tell in a minute. There\nit goes,\" and Red Shirt hastily started taking out the line. I wondered\nwhat he had got, but I saw no fish, only the bait was gone. Ha, good for\nyou, Gov'nur!\n\n\"Wasn't it too bad! I'm sure it was a big one. If you miss that way,\nwith your ability, we would have to keep a sharper watch to-day. But,\nsay, even if we miss the fish, it's far better than staring at a float,\nisn't it? Just like saying he can't ride a bike without a brake.\" Clown\nhas been getting rather gay, and I was almost tempted to swat him. I'm\njust as good as they are. The sea isn't leased by Red Shirt, and there\nmight be one obliging bonito which might get caught by my line. I\ndropped my line then, and toyed it with my finger carelessly.\n\nAfter a while something shook my line with successive jerks. I thought\nit must be a fish. Unless it was something living, it would not give\nthat tremulous shaking. Good! I have it, and I commenced drawing in the\nline, while Clown jibed me \"What? Caught one already? Very remarkable,\nindeed!\" I had drawn in nearly all the line, leaving only about five\nfeet in the water. I peeped over and saw a fish that looked like a gold\nfish with stripes was coming up swimming to right and left. It was\ninteresting. On taking it out of the water, it wriggled and jumped, and\ncovered my face with water. After some effort, I had it and tried to\ndetach the hook, but it would not come out easily. My hands became\ngreasy and the sense was anything but pleasing. I was irritated; I swung\nthe line and banged the fish against the bottom of the boat. It speedily\ndied. Red Shirt and Clown watched me with surprise. I washed my hands in\nthe water but they still smelled \"fishy.\" No more for me! I don't care\nwhat fish I might get, I don't want to grab a fish. And I presume the\nfish doesn't want to be grabbed either. I hastily rolled up the line.\n\n\"Splendid for the first honor, but that's goruki,\" Clown again made a\n\"fresh\" remark.\n\n\"Goruki sounds like the name of a Russian literator,\" said Red Shirt.\n\"Yes, just like a Russian literator,\" Clown at once seconded Red Shirt.\nGorky for a Russian literator, Maruki a photographer of Shibaku, and\nkomeno-naruki (rice) a life-giver, eh? This Red Shirt has a bad hobby of\nmarshalling before anybody the name of foreigners. Everybody has his\nspecialty. How could a teacher of mathematics like me tell whether it is\na Gorky or shariki (rikishaman). Red Shirt should have been a little\nmore considerate. And if he wants to mention such names at all, let him\nmention \"Autobiography of Ben Franklin,\" or \"Pushing to the Front,\" or\nsomething we all know. Red Shirt has been seen once in a while bringing\na magazine with a red cover entitled Imperial Literature to the school\nand poring over it with reverence. I heard it from Porcupine that Red\nShirt gets his supply of all foreign names from that magazine. Well, I\nshould say!\n\nFor some time, Red Shirt and Clown fished assiduously and within about\nan hour they caught about fifteen fish. The funny part of it was that\nall they caught were goruki; of sea-bream there was not a sign.\n\n\"This is a day of bumper crop of Russian literature,\" Red Shirt said,\nand Clown answered:\n\n\"When one as skilled as you gets nothing but goruki, it's natural for me\nto get nothing else.\"\n\nThe boatman told me that this small-sized fish goruki has too many\ntiny bones and tastes too poor to be fit for eating, but they could be\nused for fertilising. So Red Shirt and Clown were fishing fertilisers\nwith vim and vigor. As for me, one goruki was enough and I laid down\nmyself on the bottom, and looked up at the sky. This was far more\ndandy than fishing.\n\nThen the two began whispering. I could not hear well, nor did I care to.\nI was looking up at the sky and thinking about Kiyo. If I had enough of\nmoney, I thought, and came with Kiyo to such a picturesque place, how\njoyous it would be. No matter how picturesque the scene might be, it\nwould be flat in the company of Clown or of his kind. Kiyo is a poor\nwrinkled woman, but I am not ashamed to take her to any old place. Clown\nor his likes, even in a Victoria or a yacht, or in a sky-high position,\nwould not be worthy to come within her shadow. If I were the head\nteacher, and Red Shirt I, Clown would be sure to fawn on me and jeer at\nRed Shirt. They say Yedo kids are flippant. Indeed, if a fellow like\nClown was to travel the country and repeatedly declare \"I am a Yedo\nkid,\" no wonder the country folk would decide that the flippant are Yedo\nkids and Yedo kids are flippant. While I was meditating like this, I\nheard suppressed laughter. Between their laughs they talked something,\nbut I could not make out what they were talking about. \"Eh? I don't\nknow......\" \"...... That's true ...... he doesn't know ...... isn't it\npity, though .......\" \"Can that be.......\" \"With grasshoppers ......\nthat's a fact.\"\n\nI did not listen to what they were talking, but when I heard Clown say\n\"grasshoppers,\" I cocked my ear instinctively. Clown emphasized, for\nwhat reason I do not know the word \"grasshopers\" so that it would be\nsure to reach my ear plainly, and he blurred the rest on purpose. I did\nnot move, and kept on listening. \"That same old Hotta,\" \"that may be the\ncase....\" \"Tempura ...... ha, ha, ha ......\" \"...... incited ......\"\n\"...... dango also? ......\"\n\nThe words were thus choppy, but judging by their saying \"grasshoppers,\"\n\"tempura\" or \"dango,\" I was sure they were secretly talking something\nabout me. If they wanted to talk, they should do it louder. If they\nwanted to discuss something secret, why in thunder did they invite me?\nWhat damnable blokes! Grasshoppers or glass-stoppers, I was not in the\nwrong; I have kept quiet to save the face of Badger because the\nprinciple asked me to leave the matter to him. Clown has been making\nunnecessary criticisms; out with your old paint-brushes there! Whatever\nconcerns me, I will settle it myself sooner or later, and they had just\nto keep off my toes. But remarks such as \"the same old Hotta\" or \"......\nincited ......\" worried me a bit. I could not make out whether they\nmeant that Hotta incited me to extend the circle of the trouble, or that\nhe incited the students to get at me. As I gazed at the blue sky, the\nsunlight gradually waned and chilly winds commenced stirring. The clouds\nthat resembled the streaky smokes of joss sticks were slowly extending\nover a clear sky, and by degrees they were absorbed, melted and changed\nto a faint fog.\n\n\"Well, let's be going,\" said Red Shirt suddenly. \"Yes, this is the time\nwe were going. See your Madonna to-night?\" responded Clown. \"Cut out\nnonsense ...... might mean a serious trouble,\" said Red Shirt who was\nreclining against the edge of the boat, now raising himself. \"O, that's\nall right if he hears.......,\" and when Clown, so saying, turned himself\nmy way, I glared squarely in his face. Clown turned back as if to keep\naway from a dazzling light, and with \"Ha, this is going some,\" shrugged\nhis shoulders and scratched his head.\n\nThe boat was now being rowed shore-ward over the calm sea. \"You don't\nseem much fond of fishing,\" asked Red Shirt. \"No, I'd rather prefer\nlying and looking at the sky,\" I answered, and threw the stub of\ncigarette I had been smoking into the water; it sizzled and floated on\nthe waves parted by the oar.\n\n\"The students are all glad because you have come. So we want you do your\nbest.\" Red Shirt this time started something quite alien to fishing. \"I\ndon't think they are,\" I said. \"Yes; I don't mean it as flattery. They\nare, sure. Isn't it so, Mr. Yoshikawa?\"\n\n\"I should say they are. They're crazy over it,\" said Clown with an\nunctuous smile. Strange that whatever Clown says, it makes me itching\nmad. \"But, if you don't look out, there is danger,\" warned Red Shirt.\n\n\"I am fully prepared for all dangers,\" I replied. In fact, I had made up\nmy mind either to get fired or to make all the students in the dormitory\napologize to me.\n\n\"If you talk that way, that cuts everything out. Really, as a head\nteacher, I've been considering what is good for you, and wouldn't like\nyou to mistake it.\"\n\n\"The head teacher is really your friend. And I'm doing what I can for\nyou, though mighty little, because you and I are Yedo kids, and I would\nlike to have you stay with us as long as possible and we can help each\nother.\" So said Clown and it sounded almost human. I would sooner hang\nmyself than to get helped by Clown.\n\n\"And the students are all glad because you had come, but there are many\ncircumstances,\" continued Red Shirt. \"You may feel angry sometimes but\nbe patient for the present, and I will never do anything to hurt your\ninterests.\"\n\n\"You say 'many circumstances'; what are they?\"\n\n\"They're rather complicated. Well, they'll be clear to you by and by.\nYou'll understand them naturally without my talking them over. What do\nyou say, Mr. Yoshikawa?\"\n\n\"Yes, they're pretty complicated; hard to get them cleared up in a\njiffy. But they'll become clear by-the-bye. Will be understood naturally\nwithout my explaining them,\" Clown echoed Red Shirt.\n\n\"If they're such a bother, I don't mind not hearing them. I only asked\nyou because you sprang the subject.\"\n\n\"That's right. I may seem irresponsible in not concluding the thing I\nhad started. Then this much I'll tell you. I mean no offense, but you\nare fresh from school, and teaching is a new experience. And a school is\na place where somewhat complicated private circumstances are common and\none cannot do everything straight and simple\".\n\n\"If can't get it through straight and simple, how does it go?\"\n\n\"Well, there you are so straight as that. As I was saying, you're short\nof experience........\"\n\n\"I should be. As I wrote it down in my record-sheet, I'm 23 years and\nfour months.\"\n\n\"That's it. So you'd be done by some one in unexpected quarter.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid who might do me as long as I'm honest.\"\n\n\"Certainly not. No need be afraid, but I do say you look sharp; your\npredecessor was done.\"\n\nI noticed Clown had become quiet, and turning round, saw him at the\nstern talking with the boatman. Without Clown, I found our conversation\nrunning smoothly.\n\n\"By whom was my predecessor done?\"\n\n\"If I point out the name, it would reflect on the honor of that person,\nso I can't mention it. Besides there is no evidence to prove it and I\nmay be in a bad fix if I say it. At any rate, since you're here, my\nefforts will prove nothing if you fail. Keep a sharp look-out, please.\"\n\n\"You say look-out, but I can't be more watchful than I'm now. If I don't\ndo anything wrong, after all, that's all right isn't it?\"\n\nRed Shirt laughed. I did not remember having said anything provocative\nof laughter. Up to this very minute, I have been firm in my conviction\nthat I'm right. When I come to consider the situation, it appears that a\nmajority of people are encouraging others to become bad. They seem to\nbelieve that one must do wrong in order to succeed. If they happen to\nsee some one honest and pure, they sneer at him as \"Master Darling\" or\n\"kiddy.\" What's the use then of the instructors of ethics at grammar\nschools or middle schools teaching children not to tell a lie or to be\nhonest. Better rather make a bold departure and teach at schools the\ngentle art of lying or the trick of distrusting others, or show pupils\nhow to do others. That would be beneficial for the person thus taught\nand for the public as well. When Red Shirt laughed, he laughed at my\nsimplicity. My word! what chances have the simple-hearted or the pure in\na society where they are made objects of contempt! Kiyo would never\nlaugh at such a time; she would listen with profound respect. Kiyo is\nfar superior to Red Shirt.\n\n\"Of course, that't all right as long as you don't do anything wrong. But\nalthough you may not do anything wrong, they will do you just the same\nunless you can see the wrong of others. There are fellows you have got\nto watch,--the fellows who may appear off-hand, simple and so kind as to\nget boarding house for you...... Getting rather cold. 'Tis already\nautumn, isn't it. The beach looks beer-color in the fog. A fine view.\nSay, Mr. Yoshikawa, what do you think of the scene along the\nbeach?......\" This in a loud voice was addressed to Clown.\n\n\"Indeed, this is a fine view. I'd get a sketch of it if I had time.\nSeems a pity to leave it there,\" answered Clown.\n\nA light was seen upstairs at Minato-ya, and just as the whistle of a\ntrain was sounded, our boat pushed its nose deep into the sand. \"Well,\nso you're back early,\" courtesied the wife of the boatman as she stepped\nupon the sand. I stood on the edge of the boat; and whoop! I jumped out\nto the beach.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nI heartily despise Clown. It would be beneficial for Japan if such a\nfellow were tied to a quernstone and dumped into the sea. As to Red\nShirt, his voice did not suit my fancy. I believe he suppresses his\nnatural tones to put on airs and assume genteel manner. He may put on\nall kinds of airs, but nothing good will come of it with that type of\nface. If anything falls in love with him, perhaps the Madonna will be\nabout the limit. As a head-teacher, however, he is more serious than\nClown. As he did not say definitely, I cannot get to the point, but it\nappears that he warned me to look-out for Porcupine as he is crooked. If\nthat was the case, he should have declared it like a man. And if\nPorcupine is so bad a teacher as that, it would be better to discharge\nhim. What a lack of backbone for a head teacher and a Bachelor of Arts!\nAs he is a fellow so cautious as to be unable to mention the name of the\nother even in a whisper, he is surely a mollycoddle. All mollycoddles\nare kind, and that Red Shirt may be as kind as a woman. His kindness is\none thing, and his voice quite another, and it would be wrong to\ndisregard his kindness on account of his voice. But then, isn't this\nworld a funny place! The fellow I don't like is kind to me, and the\nfriend whom I like is crooked,--how absurd! Probably everything here\ngoes in opposite directions as it is in the country, the contrary holds\nin Tokyo. A dangerous place, this. By degrees, fires may get frozen and\ncustard pudding petrified. But it is hardly believable that Porcupine\nwould incite the students, although he might do most anything he wishes\nas he is best liked among them. Instead of taking in so roundabout a\nway, in the first place, it would have saved him a lot of trouble if he\ncame direct to me and got at me for a fight. If I am in his way, he had\nbetter tell me so, and ask me to resign because I am in his way. There\nis nothing that cannot be settled by talking it over. If what he says\nsounds reasonable, I would resign even tomorrow. This is not the only\ntown where I can get bread and butter; I ought not to die homeless\nwherever I go. I thought Porcupine was a better sport.\n\nWhen I came here, Porcupine was the first to treat me to ice water. To\nbe treated by such a fellow, even if it is so trifling a thing as ice\nwater, affects my honor. I had only one glass then and had him pay only\none sen and a half. But one sen or half sen, I shall not die in peace if\nI accept a favor from a swindler. I will pay it back tomorrow when I go\nto the school. I borrowed three yen from Kiyo. That three yen is not\npaid yet to-day, though it is five years since. Not that I could not\npay, but that I did not want to. Kiyo never looks to my pocket thinking\nI shall pay it back by-the-bye. Not by any means. I myself do not expect\nto fulfill cold obligation like a stranger by meditating on returning\nit. The more I worry about paying it back, the more I may be doubting\nthe honest heart of Kiyo. It would be the same as traducing her pure\nmind. I have not paid her back that three yen not because I regard her\nlightly, but because I regard her as part of myself. Kiyo and Porcupine\ncannot be compared, of course, but whether it be ice water or tea, the\nfact that I accept another's favor without saying anything is an act of\ngood-will, taking the other on his par value, as a decent fellow.\nInstead of chipping in my share, and settling each account, to receive\nmunificence with grateful mind is an acknowledgment which no amount of\nmoney can purchase. I have neither title nor official position but I am\nan independent fellow, and to have an independent fellow kowtow to you\nin acknowledgment of the favor you extend him should be considered as\nfar more than a return acknowledgment with a million yen. I made\nPorcupine blow one sen and a half, and gave him my gratitude which is\nmore costly than a million yen. He ought to have been thankful for that.\nAnd then what an outrageous fellow to plan a cowardly action behind my\nback! I will give him back that one sen and a half tomorrow, and all\nwill be square. Then I will land him one. When I thought thus far, I\nfelt sleepy and slept like a log. The next day, as I had something in my\nmind, I went to the school earlier than usual and waited for Porcupine,\nbut he did not appear for a considerable time. \"Confucius\" was there, so\nwas Clown, and finally Red Shirt, but for Porcupine there was a piece of\nchalk on his desk but the owner was not there. I had been thinking of\npaying that one sen and a half as soon as I entered the room, and had\nbrought the coppers to the school grasped in my hand. My hands get\neasily sweaty, and when I opened my hand, I found them wet. Thinking\nthat Porcupine might say something if wet coins were given him, I placed\nthem upon my desk, and cooled them by blowing in them. Then Red Shirt\ncame to me and said he was sorry to detain me yesterday, thought I have\nbeen annoyed. I told him I was not annoyed at all, only I was hungry.\nThereupon Red Shirt put his elbows upon the desk, brought his\nsauce-pan-like face close to my nose, and said; \"Say, keep dark what I\ntold you yesterday in the boat. You haven't told it anybody, have you?\"\nHe seems quite a nervous fellow as becoming one who talks in a feminish\nvoice. It was certain that I had not told it to anybody, but as I was in\nthe mood to tell it and had already one sen and a half in my hand, I\nwould be a little rattled if a gag was put on me. To the devil with Red\nShirt! Although he had not mentioned the name \"Porcupine,\" he had given\nme such pointers as to put me wise as to who the objective was, and now\nhe requested me not to blow the gaff!--it was an irresponsibility least\nto be expected from a head teacher. In the ordinary run of things, he\nshould step into the thick of the fight between Porcupine and me, and\nside with me with all his colors flying. By so doing, he might be worthy\nthe position of the head teacher, and vindicate the principle of wearing\nred shirts.\n\nI told the head teacher that I had not divulged the secret to anybody\nbut was going to fight it out with Porcupine. Red Shirt was greatly\nperturbed, and stuttered out; \"Say, don't do anything so rash as that. I\ndon't remember having stated anything plainly to you about Mr.\nHotta....... if you start a scrimmage here, I'll be greatly\nembarrassed.\" And he asked the strangely outlandish question if I had\ncome to the school to start trouble? Of course not, I said, the school\nwould not stand for my making trouble and pay me salary for it. Red\nShirt then, perspiring, begged me to keep the secret as mere reference\nand never mention it. \"All right, then,\" I assured him, \"this robs me\nshy, but since you're so afraid of it, I'll keep it all to myself.\" \"Are\nyou sure?\" repeated Red Shirt. There was no limit to his womanishness.\nIf Red Shirt was typical of Bachelors of Arts, I did not see much in\nthem. He appeared composed after having requested me to do something\nself-contradictory and wanting logic, and on top of that suspects my\nsincerity.\n\n\"Don't you mistake,\" I said to myself, \"I'm a man to the marrow, and\nhaven't the idea of breaking my own promises; mark that!\"\n\nMeanwhile the occupants of the desks on both my sides came to the room,\nand Red Shirt hastily withdrew to his own desk. Red Shirt shows some air\neven in his walk. In stepping about the room, he places down his shoes\nso as to make no sound. For the first time I came to know that making no\nsound in one's walk was something satisfactory to one's vanity. He was\nnot training himself for a burglar, I suppose. He should cut out such\nnonsense before it gets worse. Then the bugle for the opening of classes\nwas heard. Porcupine did not appear after all. There was no other way\nbut to leave the coins upon the desk and attend the class.\n\nWhen I returned to the room a little late after the first hour class,\nall the teachers were there at their desks, and Porcupine too was\nthere. The moment Porcupine saw my face, he said that he was late on\nmy account, and I should pay him a fine. I took out that one sen and a\nhalf, and saying it was the price of the ice water, shoved it on his\ndesk and told him to take it. \"Don't josh me,\" he said, and began\nlaughing, but as I appeared unusually serious, he swept the coins back\nto my desk, and flung back, \"Quit fooling.\" So he really meant to\ntreat me, eh?\n\n\"No fooling; I mean it,\" I said. \"I have no reason to accept your treat,\nand that's why I pay you back. Why don't you take it?\"\n\n\"If you're so worried about that one sen and a half, I will take it, but\nwhy do you pay it at this time so suddenly?\"\n\n\"This time or any time, I want to pay it back. I pay it back because I\ndon't like you treat me.\"\n\nPorcupine coldly gazed at me and ejaculated \"H'm.\" If I had not been\nrequested by Red Shirt, here was the chance to show up his cowardice and\nmake it hot for him. But since I had promised not to reveal the secret,\nI could do nothing. What the deuce did he mean by \"H'm\" when I was red\nwith anger.\n\n\"I'll take the price of the ice water, but I want you leave your\nboarding house.\"\n\n\"Take that coin; that's all there is to it. To leave or not,--that's my\npleasure.\"\n\n\"But that is not your pleasure. The boss of your boarding house came to\nme yesterday and wanted me to tell you leave the house, and when I heard\nhis explanation, what he said was reasonable. And I dropped there on my\nway here this morning to hear more details and make sure of everything.\"\n\nWhat Porcupine was trying to get at was all dark to me.\n\n\"I don't care a snap what the boss was damn well pleased to tell you,\" I\ncried. \"What do you mean by deciding everything by yourself! If there is\nany reason, tell me first. What's the matter with you, deciding what the\nboss says is reasonable without hearing me.\"\n\n\"Then you shall hear,\" he said. \"You're too tough and been regarded\na nuisance over there. Say, the wife of a boarding house is a wife,\nnot a maid, and you've been such a four-flusher as to make her wipe\nyour feet.\"\n\n\"When did I make her wipe my feet?\" I asked.\n\n\"I don't know whether you did or did not, but anyway they're pretty sore\nabout you. He said he can make ten or fifteen yen easily if he sell a\nroll of panel-picture.\"\n\n\"Damn the chap! Why did he take me for a boarder then!\"\n\n\"I don't know why. They took you but they want you leave because they\ngot tired of you. So you'd better get out.\"\n\n\"Sure, I will. Who'd stay in such a house even if they beg me on their\nknees. You're insolent to have induced me to go to such a false accuser\nin the first place.\"\n\n\"Might be either I'm insolent or you're tough.\" Porcupine is no less\nhot-tempered than I am, and spoke with equally loud voice. All the other\nteachers in the room, surprised, wondering what has happened, looked in\nour direction and craned their necks. I was not conscious of having done\nanything to be ashamed of, so I stood up and looked around. Clown alone\nwas laughing amused. The moment he met my glaring stare as if to say\n\"You too want to fight?\" he suddenly assumed a grave face and became\nserious. He seemed to be a little cowed. Meanwhile the bugle was heard,\nand Porcupine and I stopped the quarrel and went to the class rooms.\n\nIn the afternoon, a meeting of the teachers was going to be held to\ndiscuss the question of punishment of those students in the dormitory\nwho offended me the other night. This meeting was a thing I had to\nattend for the first time in my life, and I was totally ignorant about\nit. Probably it was where the teachers gathered to blow about their own\nopinions and the principal bring them to compromise somehow. To\ncompromise is a method used when no decision can be delivered as to the\nright or wrong of either side. It seemed to me a waste of time to hold a\nmeeting over an affair in which the guilt of the other side was plain as\ndaylight. No matter who tried to twist it round, there was no ground for\ndoubting the facts. It would have been better if the principal had\ndecided at once on such a plain case; he is surely wanting in decision.\nIf all principals are like this, a principal is a synonym of a\n\"dilly-dally.\"\n\nThe meeting hall was a long, narrow room next to that of the principal,\nand was used for dining room. About twenty chairs, with black leather\nseat, were lined around a narrow table, and the whole scene looked like\na restaurant in Kanda. At one end of the table the principal took his\nseat, and next to him Red Shirt. All the rest shifted for themselves,\nbut the gymnasium teacher is said always to take the seat farthest down\nout of modesty. The situation was new to me, so I sat down between the\nteachers of natural history and of Confucius. Across the table sat\nPorcupine and Clown. Think how I might, the face of Clown was a\ndegrading type. That of Porcupine was far more charming, even if I was\nnow on bad terms with him. The panel picture which hung in the alcove of\nthe reception hall of Yogen temple where I went to the funeral of my\nfather, looked exactly like this Porcupine. A priest told me the picture\nwas the face of a strange creature called Idaten. To-day he was pretty\nsore, and frequently stared at me with his fiery eyes rolling. \"You\ncan't bulldoze me with that,\" I thought, and rolled my own in defiance\nand stared back at him. My eyes are not well-shaped but their large size\nis seldom beaten by others. Kiyo even once suggested that I should make\na fine actor because I had big eyes.\n\n\"All now here?\" asked the principal, and the clerk named Kawamura\ncounted one, two, three and one was short. \"Just one more,\" said the\nclerk, and it ought to be; Hubbard Squash was not there. I don't know\nwhat affinity there is between Hubbard Squash and me, but I can never\nforget his face. When I come to the teachers' room, his face attracts me\nfirst; while walking out in the street, his manners are recalled to my\nmind. When I go to the hot springs, sometimes I meet him with a\npale-face in the bath, and if I hallooed to him, he would raise his\ntrembling head, making me feel sorry for him. In the school there is no\nteacher so quiet as he. He seldom, if ever, laughs or talks. I knew the\nword \"gentleman\" from books, and thought it was found only in the\ndictionary, but not a thing alive. But since I met Hubbard Squash, I was\nimpressed for the first time that the word represented a real substance.\n\nAs he is a man so attached to me, I had noticed his absence as soon as I\nentered the meeting hall. To tell the truth, I came to the hall with the\nintention of sitting next to him. The principal said that the absentee\nmay appear shortly, and untied a package he had before him, taking out\nsome hectograph sheets and began reading them. Red Shirt began polishing\nhis amber pipe with a silk handkerchief. This was his hobby, which was\nprobably becoming to him. Others whispered with their neighbors. Still\nothers were writing nothings upon the table with the erasers at the end\nof their pencils. Clown talked to Porcupine once in a while, but he was\nnot responsive. He only said \"Umh\" or \"Ahm,\" and stared at me with\nwrathful eyes. I stared back with equal ferocity.\n\nThen the tardy Hubbard Squash apologetically entered, and politely\nexplained that he was unavoidably detained. \"Well, then the meeting is\ncalled to order,\" said Badger. On these sheets was printed, first the\nquestion of the punishment of the offending students, second that of\nsuperintending the students, and two or three other matters. Badger,\nputting on airs as usual, as if he was an incarnation of education,\nspoke to the following effect.\n\n\"Any misdeeds or faults among the teachers or the students in this\nschool are due to the lack of virtues in my person, and whenever\nanything happens, I inwardly feel ashamed that a man like me could hold\nhis position. Unfortunately such an affair has taken place again, and I\nhave to apologize from my heart. But since it has happened, it cannot be\nhelped; we must settle it one way or other. The facts are as you already\nknow, and I ask you gentlemen to state frankly the best means by which\nthe affair may be settled.\"\n\nWhen I heard the principal speak, I was impressed that indeed the\nprincipal, or Badger, was saying something \"grand.\" If the principal was\nwilling to assume all responsibilities, saying it was his fault or his\nlack of virtues, it would have been better stop punishing the students\nand get himself fired first. Then there will be no need of holding such\nthing as a meeting. In the first place, just consider it by common\nsense. I was doing my night duty right, and the students started\ntrouble. The wrong doer is neither the principal nor I. If Porcupine\nincited them, then it would be enough to get rid of the students and\nPorcupine. Where in thunder would be a peach of damfool who always\nswipes other people's faults and says \"these are mine?\" It was a stunt\nmade possible only by Badger. Having made such an illogical statement,\nhe glanced at the teachers in a highly pleased manner. But no one opened\nhis mouth. The teacher of natural history was gazing at the crow which\nhad hopped on the roof of the nearby building. The teacher of Confucius\nwas folding and unfolding the hectograph sheet. Porcupine was still\nstaring at me. If a meeting was so nonsensical an affair as this, I\nwould have been better absent taking a nap at home.\n\nI became irritated, and half raised myself, intending to make a\nconvincing speech, but just then Red Shirt began saying something and I\nstopped. I saw him say something, having put away his pipe, and wiping\nhis face with a striped silk handkerchief. I'm sure he copped that\nhandkerchief from the Madonna; men should use white linen. He said:\n\n\"When I heard of the rough affairs in the dormitory, I was greatly\nashamed as the head teacher of my lack of discipline and influence. When\nsuch an affair takes place there is underlying cause somewhere. Looking\nat the affair itself, it may seem that the students were wrong, but in a\ncloser study of the facts, we may find the responsibility resting with\nthe School. Therefore, I'm afraid it might affect us badly in the future\nif we administer too severe a punishment on the strength of what has\nbeen shown on the surface. As they are youngsters, full of life and\nvigor, they might half-consciously commit some youthful pranks, without\ndue regard as to their good or bad. As to the mode of punishment itself,\nI have no right to suggest since it is a matter entirely in the hand of\nthe principal, but I should ask, considering these points, that some\nleniency be shown toward the students.\"\n\nWell, as Badger, so was Red Shirt. He declares the \"Rough Necks\" among\nthe students is not their fault but the fault of the teachers. A crazy\nperson beats other people because the beaten are wrong. Very grateful,\nindeed. If the students were so full of life and vigor, shovel them out\ninto the campus and let them wrestle their heads off. Who would have\ngrasshoppers put into his bed unconsciously! If things go on like this,\nthey may stab some one asleep, and get freed as having done the deed\nunconsciously.\n\nHaving figured it out in this wise, I thought I would state my own views\non the matter, but I wanted to give them an eloquent speech and fairly\ntake away their breath. I have an affection of the windpipe which clog\nafter two or three words when I am excited. Badger and Red Shirt are\nbelow my standing in their personality, but they were skilled in\nspeech-making, and it would not do to have them see my awkwardness. I'll\nmake a rough note of composition first, I thought, and started mentally\nmaking a sentence, when, to my surprise, Clown stood up suddenly. It was\nunusual for Clown to state his opinion. He spoke in his flippant tone:\n\n\"Really the grasshopper incident and the whoop-la affair are peculiar\nhappenings which are enough to make us doubt our own future. We teachers\nat this time must strive to clear the atmosphere of the school. And\nwhat the principal and the head teacher have said just now are fit and\nproper. I entirely agree with their opinions. I wish the punishment be\nmoderate.\"\n\nIn what Clown had said there were words but no meaning. It was a\njuxtaposition of high-flown words making no sense. All that I understood\nwas the words, \"I entirely agree with their opinions.\"\n\nClown's meaning was not clear to me, but as I was thoroughly angered, I\nrose without completing my rough note.\n\n\"I am entirely opposed to.......\" I said, but the rest did not come at\nonce. \".......I don't like such a topsy-turvy settlement,\" I added and\nthe fellows began laughing. \"The students are absolutely wrong from the\nbeginning. It would set a bad precedent if we don't make them apologize\n....... What do we care if we kick them all out ....... darn the kids\ntrying to guy a new comer.......\" and I sat down. Then the teacher of\nnatural history who sat on my right whined a weak opinion, saying \"The\nstudents may be wrong, but if we punish them too severely, they may\nstart a reaction and would make it rather bad. I am for the moderate\nside, as the head teacher suggested.\" The teacher of Confucius on my\nleft expressed his agreement with the moderate side, and so did the\nteacher of history endorse the views of the head teacher. Dash those\nweak-knees! Most of them belonged to the coterie of Red Shirt. It would\nmake a dandy school if such fellows run it. I had decided in my mind\nthat it must be either the students apologize to me or I resign, and if\nthe opinion of Red Shirt prevailed, I had determined to return home and\npack up. I had no ability of out-talking such fellows, or even if I had,\nI was in no humor to keeping their company for long. Since I don't\nexpect to remain in the school, the devil may take care of the rest. If\nI said anything, they would only laugh; so I shut my mouth tight.\n\nPorcupine, who up to this time had been listening to the others, stood\nup with some show of spirit. Ha, the fellow was going to endorse the\nviews of Red Shirt, eh? You and I got to fight it out anyway, I thought,\nso do any way you darn please. Porcupine spoke in a thunderous voice:\n\n\"I entirely differ from the opinions of the head teacher and other\ngentlemen. Because, viewed from whatever angle, this incident cannot be\nother than an attempt by those fifty students in the dormitory to make\na fool of a new teacher. The head teacher seems to trace the cause of\nthe trouble to the personality of that teacher himself, but, begging\nhis pardon, I think he is mistaken. The night that new teacher was on\nnight duty was not long after his arrival, not more than twenty days\nafter he had come into contact with the students. During those short\ntwenty days, the students could have no reason to criticise his\nknowledges or his person. If he was insulted for some cause which\ndeserved insult, there may be reasons in our considering the act of the\nstudents, but if we show undue leniency toward the frivolous students\nwho would insult a new teacher without cause, it would affect the\ndignity of this school. The spirit of education is not only in\nimparting technical knowledges, but also in encouraging honest,\nennobling and samurai-like virtues, while eliminating the evil tendency\nto vulgarity and roughness. If we are afraid of reaction or further\ntrouble, and satisfy ourselves with make-shifts, there is no telling\nwhen we can ever get rid of this evil atmosphere[G]. We are here to\neradicate this very evil. If we mean to countenance it, we had better\nnot accepted our positions here. For these reasons, I believe it proper\nto punish the students in the dormitory to the fullest extent and also\nmake them apologize to that teacher in the open.\"\n\nAll were quiet. Red Shirt again began polishing his pipe. I was greatly\nelated. He spoke almost what I had wanted to. I'm such a simple-hearted\nfellow that I forgot all about the bickerings with Porcupine, and looked\nat him with a grateful face, but he appeared to take no notice of me.\n\nAfter a while, Porcupine again stood up, and said. \"I forgot to mention\njust now, so I wish to add. The teacher on night duty that night seems\nto have gone to the hot springs during his duty hours, and I think it a\nblunder. It is a matter of serious misconduct to take the advantage of\nbeing in sole charge of the school, to slip out to a hot springs. The\nbad behavior of the students is one thing; this blunder is another, and\nI wish the principal to call attention of the responsible person to\nthat matter.\"\n\nA strange fellow! No sooner had he backed me up than he began talking me\ndown. I knew the other night watch went out during his duty hours, and\nthought it was a custom, so I went as far out as to the hot springs\nwithout considering the situation seriously. But when it was pointed out\nlike this, I realised that I had been wrong. Thereupon I rose again and\nsaid; \"I really went to the hot springs. It was wrong and I apologize.\"\nThen all again laughed. Whatever I say, they laugh. What a lot of boobs!\nSee if you fellows can make a clean breast of your own fault like this!\nYou fellows laugh because you can't talk straight.\n\nAfter that the principal said that since it appeared that there will be\nno more opinions, he will consider the matter well and administer what\nhe may deem a proper punishment. I may here add the result of the\nmeeting. The students in the dormitory were given one week's\nconfinement, and in addition to that, apologized to me. If they had not\napologized, I intended to resign and go straight home, but as it was it\nfinally resulted in a bigger and still worse affair, of which more\nlater. The principal then at the meeting said something to the effect\nthat the manners of the students should be directed rightly by the\nteachers' influence, and as the first step, no teacher should patronize,\nif possible, the shops where edibles and drinks were served, excepting,\nhowever, in case of farewell party or such social gatherings. He said he\nwould like no teacher to go singly to eating houses of lower kind--for\ninstance, noodle-house or dango shop.... And again all laughed. Clown\nlooked at Porcupine, said \"tempura\" and winked his eyes, but Porcupine\nregarded him in silence. Good!\n\nMy \"think box\" is not of superior quality, so things said by Badger were\nnot clear to me, but I thought if a fellow can't hold the job of teacher\nin a middle school because he patronizes a noodle-house or dango shop,\nthe fellow with bear-like appetite like me will never be able to hold\nit. If it was the case, they ought to have specified when calling for a\nteacher one who does not eat noodle and dango. To give an appointment\nwithout reference to the matter at first, and then to proclaim that\nnoodle or dango should not be eaten was a blow to a fellow like me who\nhas no other petty hobby. Then Red Shirt again opened his mouth.\n\n\"Teachers of the middle school belong to the upper class of society and\nthey should not be looking after material pleasures only, for it would\neventually have effect upon their personal character. But we are human,\nand it would be intolerable in a small town like this to live without\nany means of affording some pleasure to ourselves, such as fishing,\nreading literary products, composing new style poems, or haiku\n(17-syllable poem). We should seek mental consolation of higher order.\"\n\nThere seemed no prospect that he would quit the hot air. If it was a\nmental consolation to fish fertilisers on the sea, have goruki for\nRussian literature, or to pose a favorite geisha beneath pine tree, it\nwould be quite as much a mental consolation to eat dempura noodle and\nswallow dango. Instead of dwelling on such sham consolations, he would\nfind his time better spent by washing his red shirts. I became so\nexasperated that I asked; \"Is it also a mental consolation to meet the\nMadonna?\" No one laughed this time and looked at each other with queer\nfaces, and Red Shirt himself hung his head, apparently embarrassed. Look\nat that! A good shot, eh? Only I was sorry for Hubbard Squash who,\nhaving heard the remark, became still paler.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nThat very night I left the boarding house. While I was packing up, the\nboss came to me and asked if there was anything wrong in the way I was\ntreated. He said he would be pleased to correct it and suit me if I was\nsore at anything. This beats me, sure. How is it possible for so many\nboneheads to be in this world! I could not tell whether they wanted me\nto stay or get out. They're crazy. It would be disgrace for a Yedo kid\nto fuss about with such a fellow; so I hired a rikishaman and speedily\nleft the house.\n\nI got out of the house all right, but had no place to go. The rikishaman\nasked me where I was going. I told him to follow me with his mouth shut,\nthen he shall see and I kept on walking. I thought of going to\nYamashiro-ya to avoid the trouble of hunting up a new boarding house,\nbut as I had no prospect of being able to stay there long, I would have\nto renew the hunt sooner or later, so I gave up the idea. If I continued\nwalking this way, I thought I might strike a house with the sign of\n\"boarders taken\" or something similar, and I would consider the first\nhouse with the sign the one provided for me by Heaven. I kept on going\nround and round through the quiet, decent part of the town when I found\nmyself at Kajimachi. This used to be former samurai quarters where one\nhad the least chance of finding any boarding house, and I was going to\nretreat to a more lively part of the town when a good idea occurred to\nme. Hubbard Squash whom I respected lived in this part of the town. He\nis a native of the town, and has lived in the house inherited from his\ngreat grandfather. He must be, I thought, well informed about nearly\neverything in this town. If I call on him for his help, he will perhaps\nfind me a good boarding house. Fortunately, I called at his house once\nbefore, and there was no trouble in finding it out. I knocked at the\ndoor of a house, which I knew must be his, and a woman about fifty years\nold with an old fashioned paper-lantern in hand, appeared at the door. I\ndo not despise young women, but when I see an aged woman, I feel much\nmore solicitous. This is probably because I am so fond of Kiyo. This\naged lady, who looked well-refined, was certainly mother of Hubbard\nSquash whom she resembled. She invited me inside, but I asked her to\ncall him out for me. When he came I told him all the circumstances, and\nasked him if he knew any who would take me for a boarder. Hubbard Squash\nthought for a moment in a sympathetic mood, then said there was an old\ncouple called Hagino, living in the rear of the street, who had asked\nhim sometime ago to get some boarders for them as there are only two in\nthe house and they had some vacant rooms. Hubbard Squash was kind enough\nto go along with me and find out if the rooms were vacant. They were.\n\nFrom that night I boarded at the house of the Haginos. What surprised me\nwas that on the day after I left the house of Ikagin, Clown stepped in\nand took the room I had been occupying. Well used to all sorts of tricks\nand crooks as I might have been, this audacity fairly knocked me off my\nfeet. It was sickening.\n\nI saw that I would be an easy mark for such people unless I brace up\nand try to come up, or down, to their level. It would be a high time\nindeed for me to be alive if it were settled that I would not get three\nmeals a day without living on the spoils of pick pockets. Nevertheless,\nto hang myself,--healthy and vigorous as I am,--would be not only\ninexcusable before my ancestors but a disgrace before the public. Now I\nthink it over, it would have been better for me to have started\nsomething like a milk delivery route with that six hundred yen as\ncapital, instead of learning such a useless stunt as mathematics at the\nSchool of Physics. If I had done so, Kiyo could have stayed with me,\nand I could have lived without worrying about her so far a distance\naway. While I was with her I did not notice it, but separated thus I\nappreciated Kiyo as a good-natured old woman. One could not find a\nnoble natured woman like Kiyo everywhere. She was suffering from a\nslight cold when I left Tokyo and I wondered how she was getting on\nnow? Kiyo must have been pleased when she received the letter from me\nthe other day. By the way, I thought it was the time I was in receipt\nof answer from her. I spent two or three days with things like this in\nmy mind. I was anxious about the answer, and asked the old lady of the\nhouse if any letter came from Tokyo for me, and each time she would\nappear sympathetic and say no. The couple here, being formerly of\nsamurai class, unlike the Ikagin couple, were both refined. The old\nman's recital of \"utai\" in a queer voice at night was somewhat telling\non my nerves, but it was much easier on me as he did not frequent my\nroom like Ikagin with the remark of \"let me serve you tea.\"\n\nThe old lady once in a while would come to my room and chat on many\nthings. She questioned me why I had not brought my wife with me. I asked\nher if I looked like one married, reminding her that I was only twenty\nfour yet. Saying \"it is proper for one to get married at twenty four\" as\na beginning, she recited that Mr. Blank married when he was twenty, that\nMr. So-and-So has already two children at twenty two, and marshalled\naltogether about half a dozen examples,--quite a damper on my youthful\ntheory. I will then get marred at twenty four, I said, and requested her\nto find me a good wife, and she asked me if I really meant it.\n\n\"Really? You bet! I can't help wanting to get married.\"\n\n\"I should suppose so. Everybody is just like that when young.\" This\nremark was a knocker; I could not say anything to that.\n\n\"But I'm sure you have a Madam already. I have seen to that with my\nown eyes.\"\n\n\"Well, they are sharp eyes. How have you seen it?\"\n\n\"How? Aren't you often worried to death, asking if there's no letter\nfrom Tokyo?\"\n\n\"By Jupiter! This beats me!\"\n\n\"Hit the mark, haven't I?\"\n\n\"Well, you probably have.\"\n\n\"But the girls of these days are different from what they used to be and\nyou need a sharp look-out on them. So you'd better be careful.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that my Madam in Tokyo is behaving badly?\"\n\n\"No, your Madam is all right.\"\n\n\"That makes me feel safe. Then about what shall I be careful?\"\n\n\"Yours is all right. Though yours is all right.......\"\n\n\"Where is one not all right?\"\n\n\"Rather many right in this town. You know the daughter of the Toyamas?\n\n\"No, I do not.\"\n\n\"You don't know her yet? She is the most beautiful girl about here. She\nis so beautiful that the teachers in the school call her Madonna. You\nhaven't heard that?\n\n\"Ah, the Madonna! I thought it was the name of a geisha.\"\n\n\"No, Sir. Madonna is a foreign word and means a beautiful girl,\ndoesn't it?\"\n\n\"That may be. I'm surprised.\"\n\n\"Probably the name was given by the teacher of drawing.\"\n\n\"Was it the work of Clown?\"\n\n\"No, it was given by Professor Yoshikawa.\"\n\n\"Is that Madonna not all right?\"\n\n\"That Madonna-san is a Madonna not all right.\"\n\n\"What a bore! We haven't any decent woman among those with nicknames\nfrom old days. I should suppose the Madonna is not all right.\"\n\n\"Exactly. We have had awful women such as O-Matsu the Devil or Ohyaku\nthe Dakki.\n\n\"Does the Madonna belong to that ring?\"\n\n\"That Madonna-san, you know, was engaged to Professor Koga,--who brought\nyou here,--yes, was promised to him.\"\n\n\"Ha, how strange! I never knew our friend Hubbard Squash was a fellow of\nsuch gallantry. We can't judge a man by his appearance. I'll be a bit\nmore careful.\"\n\n\"The father of Professor Koga died last year,--up to that time they had\nmoney and shares in a bank and were well off,--but since then things\nhave grown worse, I don't know why. Professor Koga was too good-natured,\nin short, and was cheated, I presume. The wedding was delayed by one\nthing or another and there appeared the head teacher who fell in love\nwith the Madonna head over heels and wanted to many her.\"\n\n\"Red Shirt? He ought be hanged. I thought that shirt was not an ordinary\nkind of shirt. Well?\"\n\n\"The head-teacher proposed marriage through a go-between, but the\nToyamas could not give a definite answer at once on account of their\nrelations with the Kogas. They replied that they would consider the\nmatter or something like that. Then Red Shirt-san worked up some ways\nand started visiting the Toyamas and has finally won the heart of the\nMiss. Red Shirt-san is bad, but so is Miss Toyama; they all talk bad of\nthem. She had agreed to be married to Professor Koga and changed her\nmind because a Bachelor of Arts began courting her,--why, that would be\nan offense to the God of To-day.\"\n\n\"Of course. Not only of To-day but also of tomorrow and the day after;\nin fact, of time without end.\"\n\n\"So Hotta-san a friend of Koga-san, felt sorry for him and went to the\nhead teacher to remonstrate with him. But Red Shirt-san said that he had\nno intention of taking away anybody who is promised to another. He may\nget married if the engagement is broken, he said, but at present he was\nonly being acquainted with the Toyamas and he saw nothing wrong in his\nvisiting the Toyamas. Hotta-san couldn't do anything and returned. Since\nthen they say Red Shirt-san and Hotta-san are on bad terms.\"\n\n\"You do know many things, I should say. How did you get such details?\nI'm much impressed.\"\n\n\"The town is so small that I can know everything.\"\n\nYes, everything seems to be known more than one cares. Judging by her\nway, this woman probably knows about my tempura and dango affairs. Here\nwas a pot that would make peas rattle! The meaning of the Madonna, the\nrelations between Porcupine and Red Shirt became clear and helped me a\ndeal. Only what puzzled me was the uncertainty as to which of the two\nwas wrong. A fellow simple-hearted like me could not tell which side he\nshould help unless the matter was presented in black and white.\n\n\"Of Red Shirt and Porcupine, which is a better fellow?\"\n\n\"What is Porcupine, Sir?\"\n\n\"Porcupine means Hotta.\"\n\n\"Well, Hotta-san is physically strong, as strength goes, but Red\nShirt-san is a Bachelor of Arts and has more ability. And Red Shirt-san\nis more gentle, as gentleness goes, but Hotta-san is more popular among\nthe students.\"\n\n\"After all, which is better?\"\n\n\"After all, the one who gets a bigger salary is greater, I suppose?\"\n\nThere was no use of going on further in this way, and I closed the talk.\n\nTwo or three days after this, when I returned from the school, the old\nlady with a beaming smile, brought me a letter, saying, \"Here you are\nSir, at last. Take your time and enjoy it.\" I took it up and found it\nwas from Kiyo. On the letter were two or three retransmission slips, and\nby these I saw the letter was sent from Yamashiro-ya to the Iagins, then\nto the Haginos. Besides, it stayed at Yamashiro-ya for about one week;\neven letters seemed to stop in a hotel. I opened it, and it was a very\nlong letter.\n\n\"When I received the letter from my Master Darling, I intended to write\nan answer at once. But I caught cold and was sick abed for about one\nweek and the answer was delayed for which I beg your pardon. I am not\nwell-used to writing or reading like girls in these days, and it\nrequired some efforts to get done even so poorly written a letter as\nthis. I was going to ask my nephew to write it for me, but thought it\ninexcusable to my Master Darling when I should take special pains for\nmyself. So I made a rough copy once, and then a clean copy. I finished\nthe clean copy, in two days, but the rough copy took me four days. It\nmay be difficult for you to read, but as I have written this letter with\nall my might, please read it to the end.\"\n\nThis was the introductory part of the letter in which, about four feet\nlong, were written a hundred and one things. Well, it was difficult to\nread. Not only was it poorly written but it was a sort of juxtaposition\nof simple syllables that racked one's brain to make it clear where it\nstopped or where it began. I am quick-tempered and would refuse to read\nsuch a long, unintelligible letter for five yen, but I read this\nseriously from the first to the last. It is a fact that I read it\nthrough. My efforts were mostly spent in untangling letters and\nsentences; so I started reading it over again. The room had become a\nlittle dark, and this rendered it harder to read it; so finally I\nstepped out to the porch where I sat down and went over it carefully.\nThe early autumn breeze wafted through the leaves of the banana trees,\nbathed me with cool evening air, rustled the letter I was holding and\nwould have blown it clear to the hedge if I let it go. I did not mind\nanything like this, but kept on reading.\n\n\"Master Darling is simple and straight like a split bamboo by\ndisposition,\" it says, \"only too explosive. That's what worries me. If\nyou brand other people with nicknames you will only make enemies of\nthem; so don't use them carelessly; if you coin new ones, just tell them\nonly to Kiyo in your letters. The countryfolk are said to be bad, and I\nwish you to be careful not have them do you. The weather must be worse\nthan in Tokyo, and you should take care not to catch cold. Your letter\nis too short that I can't tell how things are going on with you. Next\ntime write me a letter at least half the length of this one. Tipping the\nhotel with five yen is all right, but were you not short of money\nafterward? Money is the only thing one can depend upon when in the\ncountry and you should economize and be prepared for rainy days. I'm\nsending you ten yen by postal money order. I have that fifty yen my\nMaster Darling gave me deposited in the Postal Savings to help you start\nhousekeeping when you return to Tokyo, and taking out this ten, I have\nstill forty yen left,--quite safe.\"\n\nI should say women are very particular on many things.\n\nWhen I was meditating with the letter flapping in my hand on the porch,\nthe old lady opened the sliding partition and brought in my supper.\n\n\"Still poring over the letter? Must be a very long one, I\nimagine,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes, this is an important letter, so I'm reading it with the wind\nblowing it about,\" I replied--the reply which was nonsense even for\nmyself,--and I sat down for supper. I looked in the dish on the tray,\nand saw the same old sweet potatoes again to-night. This new boarding\nhouse was more polite and considerate and refined than the Ikagins, but\nthe grub was too poor stuff and that was one drawback. It was sweet\npotato yesterday, so it was the day before yesterday, and here it is\nagain to-night. True, I declared myself very fond of sweet potatoes, but\nif I am fed with sweet potatoes with such insistency, I may soon have to\nquit this dear old world. I can't be laughing at Hubbard Squash; I shall\nbecome Sweet Potato myself before long. If it were Kiyo she would surely\nserve me with my favorite sliced tunny or fried kamaboko, but nothing\ndoing with a tight, poor samurai. It seems best that I live with Kiyo.\nIf I have to stay long in the school, I believe I would call her from\nTokyo. Don't eat tempura, don't eat dango, and then get turned yellow by\nfeeding on sweet potatoes only, in the boarding house. That's for an\neducator, and his place is really a hard one. I think even the priests\nof the Zen sect are enjoying better feed. I cleaned up the sweet\npotatoes, then took out two raw eggs from the drawer of my desk, broke\nthem on the edge of the rice bowl, to tide it over. I have to get\nnourishment by eating raw eggs or something, or how can I stand the\nteaching of twenty one hours a week?\n\nI was late for my bath to-day on account of the letter from Kiyo. But I\nwould not like to drop off a single day since I had been there everyday.\nI thought I would take a train to-day, and coming to the station with\nthe same old red towel dangling out of my hand, I found the train had\njust left two or three minutes ago, and had to wait for some time. While\nI was smoking a cigarette on a bench, my friend Hubbard Squash happened\nto come in. Since I heard the story about him from the old lady my\nsympathy for him had become far greater than ever. His reserve always\nappeared to me pathetic. It was no longer a case of merely pathetic;\nmore than that. I was wishing to get his salary doubled, if possible,\nand have him marry Miss Toyama and send them to Tokyo for about one\nmonth on a pleasure trip. Seeing him, therefore, I motioned him to a\nseat beside me, addressing him cheerfully:\n\n\"Hello[H], going to bath? Come and sit down here.\"\n\nHubbard Squash, appearing much awe-struck, said; \"Don't mind me,\nSir,\" and whether out of polite reluctance or I don't know what,\nremained standing.\n\n\"You have to wait for a little while before the next train starts; sit\ndown; you'll be tired,\" I persuaded him again. In fact, I was so\nsympathetic for him that I wished to have him sit down by me somehow.\nThen with a \"Thank you, Sir,\" he at last sat down. A fellow like Clown,\nalways fresh, butts in where he is not wanted; or like Porcupine\nswaggers about with a face which says \"Japan would be hard up without\nme,\" or like Red Shirt, self-satisfied in the belief of being the\nwholesaler of gallantry and of cosmetics. Or like Badger who appears to\nsay; \"If 'Education' were alive and put on a frockcoat, it would look\nlike me.\" One and all in one way or other have bravado, but I have\nnever seen any one like this Hubbard Squash, so quiet and resigned,\nlike a doll taken for a ransom. His face is rather swollen but for the\nMadonna to cast off such a splendid fellow and give preference to Red\nShirt, was frivolous beyond my understanding. Put how many dozens of\nRed Shirt you like together, it will not make one husband of stuff to\nbeat Hubbard Squash.\n\n\"Is anything wrong with you? You look quite fatigued,\" I asked.\n\n\"No, I have no particular ailments.......\"\n\n\"That's good. Poor health is the worst thing one can get.\"\n\n\"You appear very strong.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm thin, but never got sick. That's something I don't like.\"\n\nHubbard Squash smiled at my words. Just then I heard some young girlish\nlaughs at the entrance, and incidentally looking that way, I saw a\n\"peach.\" A beautiful girl, tall, white-skinned, with her head done up\nin \"high-collared\" style, was standing with a woman of about forty-five\nor six, in front of the ticket window. I am not a fellow given to\ndescribing a belle, but there was no need to repeat asserting that she\nwas beautiful. I felt as if I had warmed a crystal ball with perfume\nand held it in my hand. The older woman was shorter, but as she\nresembled the younger, they might be mother and daughter. The moment I\nsaw them, I forgot all about Hubbard Squash, and was intently gazing at\nthe young beauty. Then I was a bit startled to see Hubbard Squash\nsuddenly get up and start walking slowly toward them. I wondered if she\nwas not the Madonna. The three were courtesying in front of the ticket\nwindow, some distance away from me, and I could not hear what they were\ntalking about.\n\nThe clock at the station showed the next train to start in five\nminutes. Having lost my partner, I became impatient and longed for the\ntrain to start as soon as possible, when a fellow rushed into the\nstation excited. It was Red Shirt. He had on some fluffy clothes,\nloosely tied round with a silk-crepe girdle, and wound to it the same\nold gold chain. That gold chain is stuffed. Red Shirt thinks nobody\nknows it and is making a big show of it, but I have been wise. Red\nShirt stopped short, stared around, and then after bowing politely to\nthe three still in front of the ticket window, made a remark or two,\nand hastily turned toward me. He came up to me, walking in his usual\ncat's style, and hallooed.\n\n\"You too going to bath? I was afraid of missing the train and\nhurried up, but we have three or four minutes yet. Wonder if that\nclock is right?\"\n\nHe took out his gold watch, and remarking it wrong about two minutes sat\ndown beside me. He never turned toward the belle, but with his chin on\nthe top of a cane, steadily looked straight before him. The older woman\nwould occasionally glance toward Red Shirt, but the younger kept her\nprofile away. Surely she was the Madonna.\n\nThe train now arrived with a shrill whistle and the passengers hastened\nto board. Red Shirt jumped into the first class coach ahead of all. One\ncannot brag much about boarding the first class coach here. It cost only\nfive sen for the first and three sen for the second to Sumida; even I\npaid for the first and a white ticket. The country fellows, however,\nbeing all close, seemed to regard the expenditure of the extra two sen a\nserious matter and mostly boarded the second class. Following Red Shirt,\nthe Madonna and her mother entered the first class. Hubbard Squash\nregularly rides in the second class. He stood at the door of a second\nclass coach and appeared somewhat hesitating, but seeing me coming, took\ndecisive steps and jumped into the second. I felt sorry for him--I do\nnot know why--and followed him into the same coach. Nothing wrong in\nriding on the second with a ticket for the first, I believe.\n\nAt the hot springs, going down from the third floor to the bath room in\nbathing gown, again I met Hubbard Squash. I feel my throat clogged up\nand unable to speak at a formal gathering, but otherwise I am rather\ntalkative; so I opened conversation with him. He was so pathetic and my\ncompassion was aroused to such an extent that I considered it the duty\nof a Yedo kid to console him to the best of my ability. But Hubbard\nSquash was not responsive. Whatever I said, he would only answer \"eh?\"\nor \"umh,\" and even these with evident effort. Finally I gave up my\nsympathetic attempt and cut off the conversation.\n\nI did not meet Red Shirt at the bath. There are many bath rooms, and one\ndoes not necessarily meet the fellows at the same bath room though he\nmight come on the same train. I thought it nothing strange. When I got\nout of the bath, I found the night bright with the moon. On both sides\nof the street stood willow trees which cast their shadows on the road. I\nwould take a little stroll, I thought. Coming up toward north, to the\nend of the town, one sees a large gate to the left. Opposite the gate\nstands a temple and both sides of the approach to the temple are lined\nwith houses with red curtains. A tenderloin inside a temple gate is an\nunheard-of phenomenon. I wanted to go in and have a look at the place,\nbut for fear I might get another kick from Badger, I passed it by. A\nflat house with narrow lattice windows and black curtain at the\nentrance, near the gate, is the place where I ate dango and committed\nthe blunder. A round lantern with the signs of sweet meats hung outside\nand its light fell on the trunk of a willow tree close by. I hungered to\nhave a bite of dango, but went away forbearing.\n\nTo be unable to eat dango one is so fond of eating, is tragic. But to\nhave one's betrothed change her love to another, would be more tragic.\nWhen I think of Hubbard Squash, I believe that I should, not complain if\nI cannot eat dango or anything else for three days. Really there is\nnothing so unreliable a creature as man. As far as her face goes, she\nappears the least likely to commit so stony-hearted an act as this. But\nthe beautiful person is cold-blooded and Koga-san who is swollen like a\npumpkin soaked in water, is a gentleman to the core,--that's where we\nhave to be on the look-out. Porcupine whom I had thought candid was said\nto have incited the students and he whom then I regarded an agitator,\ndemanded of the principal a summary punishment of the students. The\ndisgustingly snobbish Red Shirt is unexpectedly considerate and warns me\nin ways more than one, but then he won the Madonna by crooked means. He\ndenies, however, having schemed anything crooked about the Madonna, and\nsays he does not care to marry her unless her engagement with Koga is\nbroken. When Ikagin beat me out of his house, Clown enters and takes my\nroom. Viewed from any angle, man is unreliable. If I write these things\nto Kiyo, it would surprise her. She would perhaps say that because it is\nthe west side of Hakone that the town had all the freaks and crooks\ndumped in together.[7]\n\n[Footnote 7: An old saying goes that east of the Hakone pass, there are\nno apparitions or freaks.]\n\nI do not by nature worry about little things, and had come so far\nwithout minding anything. But hardly a month had passed since I came\nhere, and I have begun to regard the world quite uneasily. I have not\nmet with any particularly serious affairs, but I feel as if I had grown\nfive or six years older. Better say \"good by\" to this old spot soon and\nreturn to Tokyo, I thought. While strolling thus thinking on various\nmatters, I had passed the stone bridge and come up to the levy of the\nNozeri river. The word river sounds too big; it is a shallow stream of\nabout six feet wide. If one goes on along the levy for about twelve\nblocks, he reaches the Aioi village where there is a temple of Kwanon.\n\nLooking back at the town of the hot springs, I see red lights gleaming\namid the pale moon beams. Where the sound of the drum is heard must be\nthe tenderloin. The stream is shallow but fast, whispering incessantly.\nWhen I had covered about three blocks walking leisurely upon the bank,\nI perceived a shadow ahead. Through the light of the moon, I found\nthere were two shadows. They were probably village youngsters returning\nfrom the hot springs, though they did not sing, and were exceptionally\nquiet for that.\n\nI kept on walking, and I was faster than they. The two shadows became\nlarger. One appeared like a woman. When I neared them within about sixty\nfeet, the man, on hearing my footsteps, turned back. The moon was\nshining from behind me. I could see the manner of the man then and\nsomething queer struck me. They resumed their walk as before. And I\nchased them on a full speed. The other party, unconscious, walked\nslowly. I could now hear their voice distinctly. The levy was about six\nfeet wide, and would allow only three abreast. I easily passed them, and\nturning back gazed squarely into the face of the man. The moon\ngenerously bathed my face with its beaming light. The fellow uttered a\nlow \"ah,\" and suddenly turning sideway, said to the woman \"Let's go\nback.\" They traced their way back toward the hot springs town.\n\nWas it the intention of Red Shirt to hush the matter up by pretending\nignorance, or was it lack of nerve? I was not the only fellow who\nsuffered the consequence of living in a small narrow town.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nOn my way back from the fishing to which I was invited by Red Shirt, and\nsince then, I began to suspect Porcupine. When the latter wanted me to\nget out of Ikagin's house on sham pretexts, I regarded him a decidedly\nunpleasant fellow. But as Porcupine, at the teachers' meeting, contrary\nto my expectation, stood firmly for punishing the students to the\nfullest extent of the school regulations, I thought it queer. When I\nheard from the old lady about Porcupine volunteering himself for the\nsake of Hubbard Squash to stop Red Shirt meddling with the Madonna, I\nclapped my hands and hoorayed for him. Judging by these facts, I began\nto wonder if the wrong-doer might be not Porcupine, but Red Shirt the\ncrooked one. He instilled into my head some flimsy hearsay plausibly and\nin a roundabout-way. At this juncture I saw Red Shirt taking a walk with\nthe Madonna on the levy of the Nozeri river, and I decided that Red\nShirt may be a scoundrel. I am not sure of his being really scoundrel at\nheart, but at any rate he is not a good fellow. He is a fellow with a\ndouble face. A man deserves no confidence unless he is as straight as\nthe bamboo. One may fight a straight fellow, and feel satisfied. We\ncannot lose sight of the fact that Red Shirt or his kind who is kind,\ngentle, refined, and takes pride in his pipe had to be looked sharp, for\nI could not be too careful in getting into a scrap with the fellow of\nthis type. I may fight, but I would not get square games like the\nwrestling matches it the Wrestling Amphitheatre in Tokyo. Come to think\nof it, Porcupine who turned against me and startled the whole teachers'\nroom over the amount of one sen and a half is far more like a man. When\nhe stared at me with owlish eyes at the teachers' meeting, I branded him\nas a spiteful guy, but as I consider the matter now, he is better than\nthe feline voice of Red Shirt. To tell the truth, I tried to get\nreconciled with Porcupine, and after the meeting, spoke a word or two to\nhim, but he shut up like a clam and kept glaring at me. So I became\nsore, and let it go at that.\n\nPorcupine has not spoken to me since. The one sen and a half which I\npaid him back upon the desk, is still there, well covered with dust. I\ncould not touch it, nor would Porcupine take it. This one sen and a\nhalf has become a barrier between us two. We two were cursed with this\none sen and a half. Later indeed I got sick of its sight that I hated\nto see it.\n\nWhile Porcupine and I were thus estranged, Red Shirt and I continued\nfriendly relations and associated together. On the day following my\naccidental meeting with him near the Nozeri river, for instance, Red\nShirt came to my desk as soon as he came to the school, and asked me how\nI liked the new boarding house. He said we would go together for fishing\nRussian literature again, and talked on many things. I felt a bit\npiqued, and said, \"I saw you twice last night,\" and he answered, \"Yes,\nat the station. Do you go there at that time every day? Isn't it late?\"\nI startled him with the remark; \"I met you on the levy of the Nozeri\nriver too, didn't I?\" and he replied, \"No, I didn't go in that\ndirection. I returned right after my bath.\"\n\nWhat is the use of trying to keep it dark. Didn't we meet actually face\nto face? He tells too many lies. If one can hold the job of a head\nteacher and act in this fashion, I should be able to run the position of\nChancellor of a university. From this time on, my confidence in Red\nShirt became still less. I talk with Red Shirt whom I do not trust, and\nI keep silent with Porcupine whom I respect. Funny things do happen in\nthis world.\n\nOne day Red Shirt asked me to come over to his house as he had something\nto tell me, and much as I missed the trip to the hot springs, I started\nfor his house at about 4 o'clock. Red Shirt is single, but in keeping\nwith the dignity of a head teacher, he gave up the boarding house life\nlong ago, and lives in a fine house. The house rent, I understood, was\nnine yen and fifty sen. The front entrance was so attractive that I\nthought if one can live in such a splendid house at nine yen and a half\nin the country, it would be a good game to call Kiyo from Tokyo and make\nher heart glad. The younger brother of Red Shirt answered my bell. This\nbrother gets his lessons on algebra and mathematics from me at the\nschool. He stands no show in his school work, and being a \"migratory\nbird\" is more wicked than the native boys.\n\nI met Red Shirt. Smoking the same old unsavory amber pipe, he said\nsomething to the following effect:\n\n\"Since you've been with us, our work has been more satisfactory than it\nwas under your predecessor, and the principal is very glad to have got\nthe right person in the right place. I wish you to work as hard as you\ncan, for the school is depending upon you.\"\n\n\"Well, is that so. I don't think I can work any harder than now.......\"\n\n\"What you're doing now is enough. Only don't forget what I told you the\nother day.\"\n\n\"Meaning that one who helps me find a boarding house is dangerous?\"\n\n\"If you state it so baldly, there is no meaning to it....... But that's\nall right,...... I believe you understand the spirit of my advice. And\nif you keep on in the way you're going to-day ...... We have not been\nblind ...... we might offer you a better treatment later on if we can\nmanage it.\"\n\n\"In salary? I don't care about the salary, though the more the better.\"\n\n\"And fortunately there is going to be one teacher transferred,......\nhowever, I can't guarantee, of course, until I talk it over with the\nprincipal ...... and we might give you something out of his salary.\"\n\n\"Thank you. Who is going to be transferred?\"\n\n\"I think I may tell you now; 'tis going to be Announced soon. Koga\nis the man.\"\n\n\"But isn't Koga-san a native of this town?\"\n\n\"Yes, he is. But there are some circumstances ...... and it is partly by\nhis own preference.\"\n\n\"Where is he going?\"\n\n\"To Nobeoka in Hiuga province. As the place is so far away, he is going\nthere with his salary raised a grade higher.\"\n\n\"Is some one coming to take his place?\"\n\n\"His successor is almost decided upon.\"\n\n\"Well, that's fine, though I'm not very anxious to have my salary\nraised.\"\n\n\"I'm going to talk to the principal about that anyway. And, we may have\nto ask you to work more some time later ...... and the principal appears\nto be of the same opinion....... I want you to go[I] ahead with that in\nyour mind.\"\n\n\"Going to increase my working hours?\"\n\n\"No. The working hours may be reduced......\"\n\n\"The working hours shortened and yet work more? Sounds funny.\"\n\n\"It does sound funny ...... I can't say definitely just yet ...... it\nmeans that we way have to ask you to assume more responsibility.\"\n\nI could not make out what he meant. To assume more responsibility might\nmean my appointment to the senior instructor of mathematics, but\nPorcupine is the senior instructor and there is no danger of his\nresigning. Besides, he is so very popular among the students that his\ntransfer or discharge would be inadvisable. Red Shirt always misses the\npoint. And though he did not get to the point, the object of my visit\nwas ended. We talked a while on sundry matters, Red Shirt proposing a\nfarewell dinner party for Hubbard Squash, asking me if I drink liquor\nand praising Hubbard Squash as an amiable gentleman, etc. Finally he\nchanged the topic and asked me if I take an interest in \"haiku\"[8] Here\nis where I beat it, I thought, and, saying \"No, I don't, good by,\"\nhastily left the house. The \"haiku\" should be a diversion of Baseo[9] or\nthe boss of a barbershop. It would not do for the teacher of mathematics\nto rave over the old wooden bucket and the morning glory.[10]\n\n[Footnote 8: The 17-syllable poem]\n\n[Footnote 9: A famous composer of the poem.]\n\n[Footnote 10: There is a well-known 17-syllable poem describing the\nscene of morning glories entwining around the wooden bucket.]\n\nI returned home and thought it over. Here is a man whose mental process\ndefies a layman's understanding. He is going to court hardships in a\nstrange part of the country in preference of his home and the school\nwhere he is working,--both of which should satisfy most\nanybody,--because he is tired of them. That may be all right if the\nstrange place happens to be a lively metropolis where electric cars\nrun,--but of all places, why Nobeoka in Hiuga province? This town here\nhas a good steamship connection, yet I became sick of it and longed for\nhome before one month had passed. Nobeoka is situated in the heart of a\nmost mountainous country. According to Red Shirt, one has to make an\nall-day ride in a wagonette to Miyazaki, after he had left the vessel,\nand from Miyazaki another all-day ride in a rikisha to Nobeoka. Its name\nalone does not commend itself as civilized. It sounds like a town\ninhabited by men and monkeys in equal numbers. However sage-like Hubbard\nSquash might be I thought he would not become a friend of monkeys of his\nown choice. What a curious slant!\n\nJust then the old lady brought in my supper--\"Sweet potatoes again?\" I\nasked, and she said, \"No, Sir, it is tofu to-night.\" They are about the\nsame thing.\n\n\"Say, I understand Koga-san is going to Nobeoka.\"\n\n\"Isn't it too bad?\"\n\n\"Too bad? But it can't be helped if he goes there by his own\npreference.\"\n\n\"Going there by his own preference? Who, Sir?\"\n\n\"Who? Why, he! Isn't Professor Koga going there by his own choice?\"\n\n\"That's wrong Mr. Wright, Sir.\"\n\n\"Ha, Mr. Wright, is it? But Red Shirt told me so just now. If that's\nwrong Mr. Wright, then Red Shirt is blustering Mr. Bluff.\"\n\n\"What the head-teacher says is believable, but so Koga-san does not\nwish to go.\"\n\n\"Our old lady is impartial, and that is good. Well, what's the matter?\"\n\n\"The mother of Koga-san was here this morning, and told me all the\ncircumstances.\"\n\n\"Told you what circumstances?\"\n\n\"Since the father of Koga-san died, they have not been quite well off as\nwe might have supposed, and the mother asked the principal if his salary\ncould not be raised a little as Koga-san has been in service for four\nyears. See?\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"The principal said that he would consider the matter, and she felt\nsatisfied and expected the announcement of the increase before long. She\nhoped for its coming this month or next. Then the principal called\nKoga-san to his office one day and said that he was sorry but the school\nwas short of money and could not raise his salary. But he said there is\nan opening in Nobeoka which would give him five yen extra a month and he\nthought that would suit his purpose, and the principal had made all\narrangements and told Koga-san he had better go.......\"\n\n\"That wasn't a friendly talk but a command. Wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir, Koga-san told the principal that he liked to stay here better\nat the old salary than go elsewhere on an increased salary, because he\nhas his own house and is living with his mother. But the matter has all\nbeen settled, and his successor already appointed and it couldn't be\nhelped, said the principal.\"\n\n\"Hum, that's a jolly good trick, I should say. Then Koga-san has no\nliking to go there? No wonder I thought it strange. We would have to go\na long way to find any blockhead to do a job in such a mountain village\nand get acquainted with monkeys for five yen extra.\"\n\n\"What is a blockhead, Sir?\"\n\n\"Well, let go at that. It was all the scheme of Red Shirt. Deucedly\nunderhand scheme, I declare. It was a stab from behind. And he means to\nraise my salary by that; that's not right. I wouldn't take that raise.\nLet's see if he can raise it.\"\n\n\"Is your salary going to be raised, Sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, they said they would raise mine, but I'm thinking of refusing it.\"\n\n\"Why do you refuse?\"\n\n\"Why or no why, it's going to be refused. Say, Red Shirt is a fool; he\nis a coward.\"\n\n\"He may be a coward, but if he raises your salary, it would be best for\nyou to make no fuss, but accept it. One is apt to get grouchy when\nyoung, but will always repent when he is grown up and thinks that it was\npity he hadn't been a little more patient. Take an old woman's advice\nfor once, and if Red Shirt-san says he will raise your salary, just take\nit with thanks.\"\n\n\"It's none of business of you old people.\"\n\nThe old lady withdrew in silence. The old man is heard singing \"utai\" in\nthe off-key voice. \"Utai,\" I think, is a stunt which purposely makes a\nwhole show a hard nut to crack by giving to it difficult tunes, whereas\none could better understand it by reading it. I cannot fathom what is in\nthe mind of the old man who groans over it every night untired. But I'm\nnot in a position to be fooling with \"utai.\" Red Shirt said he would\nhave my salary raised, and though I did not care much about it, I\naccepted it because there was no use of leaving the money lying around.\nBut I cannot, for the love of Mike, be so inconsiderate as to skin the\nsalary of a fellow teacher who is being transferred against his will.\nWhat in thunder do they mean by sending him away so far as Nobeoka when\nthe fellow prefers to remain in his old position? Even\nDazai-no-Gonnosutsu did not have to go farther than about Hakata; even\nMatagoro Kawai [11] stopped at Sagara. I shall not feel satisfied unless\nI see Red Shirt and tell him I refuse the raise.\n\n[Footnote 11: The persons in exile, well-known in Japanese history.]\n\nI dressed again and went to his house. The same younger brother of Red\nShirt again answered the bell, and looked at me with eyes which plainly\nsaid, \"You here again?\" I will come twice or thrice or as many times as\nI want to if there is business. I might rouse them out of their beds at\nmidnight;--it is possible, who knows. Don't mistake me for one coming to\ncoax the head teacher. I was here to give back my salary. The younger\nbrother said that there is a visitor just now, and I told him the front\ndoor will do; won't take more than a minute, and he went in. Looking\nabout my feet, I found a pair of thin, matted wooden clogs, and I heard\nsome one in the house saying, \"Now we're banzai.\" I noticed that the\nvisitor was Clown. Nobody but Clown could make such a squeaking voice\nand wear such clogs as are worn by cheap actors.\n\nAfter a while Red Shirt appeared at the door with a lamp in his hand,\nand said, \"Come in; it's no other than Mr. Yoshikawa.\"\n\n\"This is good enough,\" I said, \"it won't take long.\" I looked at his\nface which was the color of a boiled lobster. He seemed to have been\ndrinking with Clown.\n\n\"You told me that you would raise my salary, but I've changed my mind,\nand have come here to decline the offer.\"\n\nRed Shirt, thrusting out the lamp forward, and intently staring at me,\nwas unable to answer at the moment. He appeared blank. Did he think it\nstrange that here was one fellow, only one in the world, who does not\nwant his salary raised, or was he taken aback that I should come back so\nsoon even if I wished to decline it, or was it both combined, he stood\nthere silent with his mouth in a queer shape.\n\n\"I accepted your offer because I understood that Mr. Koga was being\ntransferred by his own preference.......\"\n\n\"Mr. Koga is really going to be transferred by his own preference.\"\n\n\"No, Sir. He would like to stay here. He doesn't mind his present salary\nif he can stay.\"\n\n\"Have you heard it from Mr. Koga himself?\"\n\n\"No, not from him.\"\n\n\"Then, from who?\"\n\n\"The old lady in my boarding house told me what she heard from the\nmother of Mr. Koga.\"\n\n\"Then the old woman in your boarding house told you so?\"\n\n\"Well, that's about the size of it.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, but I think you are wrong. According to what you say, it\nseems as if you believe what the old woman in the boarding house tells\nyou, but would not believe what your head teacher tells you. Am I right\nto understand it that way?\"\n\nI was stuck. A Bachelor of Arts is confoundedly good in oratorical\ncombat. He gets hold of unexpected point, and pushes the other backward.\nMy father used to tell me that I am too careless and no good, and now\nindeed I look that way. I ran out of the house on the moment's impulse\nwhen I heard the story from the old lady, and in fact I had not heard\nthe story from either Hubbard Squash or his mother. In consequence, when\nI was challenged in this Bachelor-of-Arts fashion, it was a bit\ndifficult to defend myself.\n\nI could not defend his frontal attack, but I had already declared in my\nmind a lack of confidence on Red Shirt. The old lady in the boarding\nhouse may be tight and a grabber, I do not doubt it, but she is a woman\nwho tells no lie. She is not double faced like Red Shirt, I was\nhelpless, so I answered.\n\n\"What you say might be right,--anyway, I decline the raise.\"\n\n\"That's still funnier. I thought your coming here now was because you\nhad found a certain reason for which you could not accept the raise.\nThen it is hard to understand to see you still insisting on declining\nthe raise in spite of the reason having been eradicated by my\nexplanation.\"\n\n\"It may be hard to understand, but anyway I don't want it.\"\n\n\"If you don't like it so much, I wouldn't force it on you. But if you\nchange your mind within two or three hours with no particular reason, it\nwould affect your credit in future.\"\n\n\"I don't care if it does affect it.\"\n\n\"That can't be. Nothing is more important than credit for us. Supposing,\nthe boss of the boarding house.......\"\n\n\"Not the boss, but the old lady.\"\n\n\"Makes no difference,--suppose what the old woman in the boarding house\ntold you was true, the raise of your salary is not to be had by reducing\nthe income of Mr. Koga, is it? Mr. Koga is going to Nobeoka; his\nsuccessor is coming. He comes on a salary a little less than that of Mr.\nKoga, and we propose to add the surplus money to your salary, and you\nneed not be shy. Mr. Koga will be promoted; the successor is to start on\nless pay, and if you could be raised, I think everything be satisfactory\nto all concerned. If you don't like it, that's all right, but suppose\nyou think it over once more at home?\"\n\nMy brain is not of the best stuff, and if another fellow flourishes his\neloquence like this, I usually think, \"Well, perhaps I was wrong,\" and\nconsider myself defeated, but not so to-night. From the time I came to\nthis town I felt prejudiced against Red Shirt. Once I had thought of him\nin a different light, taking him for a fellow kind-hearted and\nfeminished. His kindness, however, began to look like anything but\nkindness, and as a result, I have been getting sick of him. So no matter\nhow he might glory himself in logical grandiloquence, or how he might\nattempt to out-talk me in a head-teacher-style, I don't care a snap. One\nwho shines in argument is not necessarily a good fellow, while the other\nwho is out-talked is not necessarily a bad fellow, either. Red Shirt is\nvery, very reasonable as far as his reasoning goes, but however graceful\nhe may appear, he cannot win my respect. If money, authority or\nreasoning can command admiration, loansharks, police officers or college\nprofessors should be liked best by all. I cannot be moved in the least\nby the logic by so insignificant a fellow as the head teacher of a\nmiddle school. Man works by preference, not by logic.\n\n\"What you say is right, but I have begun to dislike the raise, so I\ndecline. It will be the same if I think it over. Good by.\" And I left\nthe house of Red Shirt. The solitary milky way hung high in the sky.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\nWhen I went to the school, in the morning of the day the farewell dinner\nparty was to be held, Porcupine suddenly spoke to me;\n\n\"The other day I asked you to quit the Ikagins because Ikagin begged of\nme to have you leave there as you were too tough, and I believed him.\nBut I heard afterward that Ikagin is a crook and often passes imitation\nof famous drawings for originals. I think what he told me about you must\nbe a lie. He tried to sell pictures and curios to you, but as you shook\nhim off, he told some false stories on you. I did very wrong by you\nbecause I did not know his character, and wish you would forgive me.\"\nAnd he offered me a lengthy apology.\n\nWithout saying a word, I took up the one sen and a half which was lying\non the desk of Porcupine, and put it into my purse. He asked me in a\nwondering tone, if I meant to take it back. I explained, \"Yes. I didn't\nlike to have you treat me and expected to pay this back at all hazard,\nbut as I think about it, I would rather have you treated me after all;\nso I'm going to take it back.\"\n\nPorcupine laughed heartily and asked me why I had not taken it back\nsooner. I told him that I wanted to more than once, in fact, but somehow\nfelt shy and left it there. I was sick of that one sen and a half these\ndays that I shunned the sight of it when I came to the school, I said.\nHe said \"You're a deucedly unyielding sport,\" and I answered \"You're\nobstinate.\" Then ensued the following give-and-take between us two;\n\n\"Where were you born anyway?\"\n\n\"I'm a Yedo kid.\"\n\n\"Ah, a Yedo kid, eh? No wonder I thought you a pretty stiff neck.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"I'm from Aizu.\"\n\n\"Ha, Aizu guy, eh? You've got reason to be obstinate. Going to the\nfarewell dinner to-day?\"\n\n\"Sure. You?\"\n\n\"Of course I am. I intend to go down to the beach to see Koga-san off\nwhen he leaves.\"\n\n\"The farewell dinner should be a big blow-out. You come and see. I'm\ngoing to get soused to the neck.\"\n\n\"You get loaded all you want. I quit the place right after I finish my\nplates. Only fools fight booze.\"\n\n\"You're a fellow who picks up a fight too easy. It shows up the\ncharacteristic of the Yedo kid well.\"\n\n\"I don't care. Say, before you go to the farewell dinner, come to see\nme. I want to tell you something.\"\n\nPorcupine came to my room as promised. I had been in full sympathy with\nHubbard Squash these days, and when it came to his farewell dinner, my\npity for him welled up so much that I wished I could go to Nobeoka for\nhim myself. I thought of making a parting address of burning eloquence\nat the dinner to grace the occasion, but my speech which rattles off\nlike that of the excited spieler of New York would not become the place.\nI planned to take the breath out of Red Shirt by employing Porcupine who\nhas a thunderous voice. Hence my invitation to him before we started for\nthe party.\n\nI commenced by explaining the Madonna affair, but Porcupine, needless to\nsay, knew more about it than I. Telling about my meeting Red Shirt on\nthe Nozeri river, I called him a fool. Porcupine then said; \"You call\neverybody a fool. You called me a fool to-day at the school. If I'm a\nfool, Red Shirt isn't,\" and insisted that he was not in the same group\nwith Red Shirt. \"Then Red Shirt may be a four-flusher,\" I said and he\napproved this new alias with enthusiasm. Porcupine is physically strong,\nbut when it comes to such terms, he knows less than I do. I guess all\nAizu guys are about the same.\n\nThen, when I disclosed to him about the raise of my salary and the\nadvance hint on my promotion by Red Shirt, Porcupine pished, and said,\n\"Then he means to discharge me.\" \"Means to discharge you? But you mean\nto get discharged?\" I asked. \"Bet you, no. If I get fired, Red Shirt\nwill have to go with me,\" he remarked with a lordly air. I insisted on\nknowing how he was going to get Red Shirt kicked out with him, and he\nanswered that he had not thought so far yet. Yes, Porcupine looks\nstrong, but seems to be possessed of no abundance of brain power. I told\nhim about my refusal of the raise of my salary, and the Gov'nur was much\npleased, praising me with the remark, \"That's the stuff for Yedo kids.\"\n\n\"If Hubbard Squash does not like to go down to Nobeoka, why didn't you\ndo something to enable him remain here,\" I asked, and Porcupine said\nthat when he heard the story from Hubbard Squash, everything had been\nsettled already, but he had asked the principal twice and Red Shirt once\nto have the transfer order cancelled, but to no purpose. Porcupine\nbitterly condemned Hubbard Squash for being too good-natured. If Hubbard\nSquash, he said, had either flatly refused or delayed the answer on the\npretext of considering it, when Red Shirt raised the question of\ntransfer, it would have been better for him. But he was fooled by the\noily tongue of Red Shirt, had accepted the transfer outright, and all\nefforts by Porcupine who was moved by the tearful appeal of the mother,\nproved unavailing.\n\nI said; \"The transfer of Koga is nothing but a trick of Red Shirt to cop\nthe Madonna by sending Hubbard Squash away.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Porcupine \"That must be. Red Shirt looks gentle, but plays\nnasty tricks. He is a sonovagun for when some one finds fault with him,\nhe has excuses prepared already. Nothing but a sound thumping will be\neffective for fellows like him.\"\n\nHe rolled up his sleeves over his plump arms as he spoke. I asked him,\nby the way, if he knew jiujitsu, because his arms looked powerful. Then\nhe put force in his forearm, and told me to touch it. I felt its swelled\nmuscle which was hard as the pumic stone in the public bathhouse.\n\nI was deeply impressed by his massive strength, and asked him if he\ncould not knock five or six of Red Shirt in a bunch. \"Of course,\" he\nsaid, and as he extended and bent back the arm, the lumpy muscle rolled\nround and round, which was very amusing. According to the statement of\nPorcupine himself, this muscle, if he bends the arm back with force,\nwould snap a paper-string wound around it twice. I said I might do the\nsame thing if it were a paper-string, and he challenged me. \"No, you\ncan't,\" he said. \"See if you can.\" As it would not look well if I\nfailed, I did not try.\n\n\"Say, after you have drunk all you want to-night at the dinner, take a\nfall out of Red Shirt and Clown, eh?\" I suggested to him for fun.\nPorcupine thought for a moment and said, \"Not to-night, I guess.\" I\nwanted to know why, and he pointed out that it would be bad for Koga.\n\n\"Besides, if I'm going to give it to them at all, I've to get them red\nhanded in their dirty scheme, or all the blame will be on me,\" he added\ndiscretely. Even Porcupine seems to have wiser judgment than I.\n\n\"Then make a speech and praise Mr. Koga sky-high. My speech becomes sort\nof jumpy, wanting dignity. And at any formal gathering, I get lumpy in\nmy throat, and can't speak. So I leave it to you,\" I said.\n\n\"That's a strange disease. Then you can't speak in the presence of other\npeople? It would be awkward, I suppose,\" he said, and I told him not\nquite as much awkward as he might think.\n\nAbout then, the time for the farewell dinner party arrived, and I went\nto the hall with Porcupine. The dinner party was to be held at\nKashin-tei which is said to be the leading restaurant in the town, but I\nhad never been in the house before. This restaurant, I understood, was\nformerly the private residence of the chief retainer of the daimyo of\nthe province, and its condition seemed to confirm the story. The\nresidence of a chief retainer transformed into a restaurant was like\nmaking a saucepan out of warrior's armor.\n\nWhen we two came there, about all of the guests were present. They\nformed two or three groups in the spacious room of fifty mats. The\nalcove in this room, in harmony with its magnificence, was very large.\nThe alcove in the fifteen-mat room which I occupied at Yamashiro-ya made\na small showing beside it. I measured it and found it was twelve feet\nwide. On the right, in the alcove, there was a seto-ware flower vase,\npainted with red designs, in which was a large branch of pine tree. Why\nthe pine twigs, I did not know, except that they are in no danger of\nwithering for many a month to come, and are economical. I asked the\nteacher of natural history where that seto-ware flower vase is made. He\ntold me it was not a seto-ware but an imari. Isn't imari seto-ware? I\nwondered audibly, and the natural history man laughed. I heard afterward\nthat we call it a seto-ware because it is made in Seto. I'm a Yedo kid,\nand thought all china was seto-wares. In the center of the alcove was\nhung a panel on which were written twenty eight letters, each letter as\nlarge as my face. It was poorly written; so poorly indeed that I\nenquired of the teacher of Confucius why such a poor work be hung in\napparent show of pride. He explained that it was written by Kaioku a\nfamous artist in the writing, but Kaioku or anyone else, I still declare\nthe work poorly done.\n\nBy and by, Kawamura, the clerk, requested all to be seated. I chose one\nin front of a pillar so I could lean against it. Badger sat in front of\nthe panel of Kaioku in Japanese full dress. On his left sat Red Shirt\nsimilarly dressed, and on his right Hubbard Squash, as the guest of\nhonor, in the same kind of dress. I was dressed in a European suit, and\nbeing unable to sit down, squatted on my legs at once. The teacher of\nphysical culture next to me, though in the same kind of rags as mine,\nsat squarely in Japanese fashion. As a teacher of his line he appeared\nto have well trained himself. Then the dinner trays were served and the\nbottles placed beside them. The manager of the day stood up and made a\nbrief opening address. He was followed by Badger and Red Shirt. These\ntwo made farewell addresses, and dwelt at length on Hubbard Squash being\nan ideal teacher and gentleman, expressing their regret, saying his\ndeparture was a great loss not only to the school but to them in person.\nThey concluded that it could not be helped, however, since the transfer\nwas due to his own earnest desire and for his own convenience. They\nappeared to be ashamed not in the least by telling such a lie at a\nfarewell dinner. Particularly, Red Shirt, of these three, praised Hubard\nSquash in lavish terms. He went so far as to declare that to lose this\ntrue friend was a great personal loss to him. Moreover, his tone was so\nimpressive in its same old gentle tone that one who listens to him for\nthe first time would be sure to be misled. Probably he won the Madonna\nby this same trick. While Red Shirt was uttering his farewell buncomb,\nPorcupine who sat on the other side across me, winked at me. As an\nanswer of this, I \"snooked\" at him.\n\nNo sooner had Red Shirt sat down than Porcupine stood up, and highly\nrejoiced, I clapped hands. At this Badger and others glanced at me, and\nI felt that I blushed a little.\n\n\"Our principal and other gentlemen,\" he said, \"particularly the head\nteacher, expressed their sincere regret at Mr. Koga's transfer. I am of\na different opinion, and hope to see him leave the town at the earliest\npossible moment. Nobeoka is an out-of-the-way, backwoods town, and\ncompared with this town, it may have more material inconveniences, but\naccording to what I have heard, Nobeoka is said to be a town where the\ncustoms are simple and untainted, and the teachers and students still\nstrong in the straightforward characteristics of old days. I am\nconvinced that in Nobeoka there is not a single high-collared guy who\npasses round threadbare remarks, or who with smooth face, entraps\ninnocent people. I am sure that a man like Mr. Koga, gentle and honest,\nwill surely be received with an enthusiastic welcome there. I heartily\nwelcome this transfer for the sake of Mr. Koga. In concluding, I hope\nthat when he is settled down at Nobeoka, he will find a lady qualified\nto become his wife, and form a sweet home at an early date and\nincidentally let the inconstant, unchaste sassy old wench die ashamed\n...... a'hum, a'hum!\"\n\nHe coughed twice significantly and sat down. I thought of clapping my\nhands again, but as it would draw attention, I refrained. When\nPorcupine finished his speech, Hubbard Squash arose politely, slipped\nout of his seat, went to the furthest end of the room, and having bowed\nto all in a most respectful manner, acknowledged the compliments in the\nfollowing way;\n\n\"On the occasion of my going to Kyushu for my personal convenience, I am\ndeeply impressed and appreciate the way my friends have honored me with\nthis magnificent dinner....... The farewell addresses by our principal\nand other gentlemen will be long held in my fondest recollection.......\nI am going far away now, but I hope my name be included in the future as\nin the past in the list of friends of the gentlemen here to-night.\"\n\nThen again bowing, he returned to his seat. There was no telling how far\nthe \"good-naturedness\" of Hubbard Squash might go. He had respectfully\nthanked the principal and the head teacher who had been fooling him. And\nit was not a formal, cut-and-dried reply he made, either; by his manner,\ntone and face, he appeared to have been really grateful from his heart.\nBadger and Red Shirt should have blushed when they were addressed so\nseriously by so good a man as Hubbard Squash, but they only listened\nwith long faces.\n\nAfter the exchange of addresses, a sizzling sound was heard here and\nthere, and I too tried the soup which tasted like anything but soup.\nThere was kamaboko in the kuchitori dish, but instead of being snow\nwhite as it should be, it looked grayish, and was more like a poorly\ncooked chikuwa. The sliced tunny was there, but not having been sliced\nfine, passed the throat like so many pieces of chopped raw tunny. Those\naround me, however, ate with ravenous appetite. They have not tasted, I\nguess, the real Yedo dinner.\n\nMeanwhile the bottles began passing round, and all became more or less\n\"jacked up.\" Clown proceeded to the front of the principal and\nsubmissively drank to his health. A beastly fellow, this! Hubbard Squash\nmade a round of all the guests, drinking to their health. A very onerous\njob, indeed. When he came to me and proposed my health, I abandoned the\nsquatting posture and sat up straight.\n\n\"Too bad to see you go away so soon. When are you going? I want to see\nyou off at the beach,\" I said.\n\n\"Thank you, Sir. But never mind that. You're busy,\" he declined. He\nmight decline, but I was determined to get excused for the day and give\nhim a rousing send-off.\n\nWithin about an hour from this, the room became pretty lively.\n\n\"Hey, have another, hic; ain't goin', hic, have one on me?\" One or two\nalready in a pickled state appeared on the scene. I was little tired,\nand going out to the porch, was looking at the old fashioned garden by\nthe dim star light, when Porcupine came.\n\n\"How did you like my speech? Wasn't it grand, though!\" he remarked in a\nhighly elated tone. I protested that while I approved 99 per cent, of\nhis speech, there was one per cent, that I did not. \"What's that one per\ncent?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well, you said,...... there is not a single high-collared guy who with\nsmooth face entraps innocent people.......\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"A 'high-collared guy' isn't enough.\"\n\n\"Then what should I say?\"\n\n\"Better say,--'a high-collared guy; swindler, bastard,\nsuper-swanker, doubleface, bluffer, totempole, spotter, who looks\nlike a dog as he yelps.'\"\n\n\"I can't get my tongue to move so fast. You're eloquent. In the first\nplace, you know a great many simple words. Strange that you can't make\na speech.\"\n\n\"I reserve these words for use when I chew the rag. If it comes to\nspeech-making, they don't come out so smoothly.\"\n\n\"Is that so? But they simply come a-running. Repeat that again for me.\"\n\n\"As many times as you like. Listen,--a high-collared guy, swindler,\nbastard, super-swanker ...\"\n\nWhile I was repeating this, two shaky fellows came out of the room\nhammering the floor.\n\n\"Hey, you two gents, if won't do to run away. Won't let you off while\nI'm here. Come and have a drink. Bastard? That's fine. Bastardly fine.\nNow, come on.\"\n\nAnd they pulled Porcupine and me away. These two fellows really had come\nto the lavatory, but soaked as they were, in booze bubbles, they\napparently forgot to proceed to their original destination, and were\npulling us hard. All booze fighters seem to be attracted by whatever\ncomes directly under their eyes for the moment and forget what they had\nbeen proposing to do.\n\n\"Say, fellows, we've got bastards. Make them drink. Get them loaded. You\ngents got to stay here.\"\n\nAnd they pushed me who never attempted to escape against the wall.\nSurveying the scene, I found there was no dish in which any edibles were\nleft. Some one had eaten all his share, and gone on a foraging\nexpedition. The principal was not there,--I did not know when he left.\n\nAt that time, preceded by a coquetish voice, three or four geishas\nentered the room. I was a bit surprised, but having been pushed against\nthe wall, I had to look on quietly. At the instant, Red Shirt who had\nbeen leaning against a pillar with the same old amber pipe stuck into\nhis mouth with some pride, suddenly got up and started to leave the\nroom. One of the geishas who was advancing toward him smiled and\ncourtesied at him as she passed by him. The geisha was the youngest and\nprettiest of the bunch. They were some distance away from me and I could\nnot see very well, but it seemed that she might have said \"Good\nevening.\" Red Shirt brushed past as if unconscious, and never showed\nagain. Probably he followed the principal.\n\nThe sight of the geishas set the room immediately in a buzz and it\nbecame noisy as they all raised howls of welcome. Some started the game\nof \"nanko\" with a force that beat the sword-drawing practice. Others\nbegan playing morra, and the way they shook their hands, intently\nabsorbed in the game, was a better spectacle than a puppet show.\n\nOne in the corner was calling \"Hey, serve me here,\" but shaking the\nbottle, corrected it to \"Hey, fetch me more sake.\" The whole room\nbecame so infernally noisy that I could scarcely stand it. Amid this\norgy, one, like a fish out of water, sat down with his head bowed. It\nwas Hubbard Squash. The reason they have held this farewell dinner\nparty was not in order to bid him a farewell, but because they wanted\nto have a jolly good time for themselves with John Barleycorn. He had\ncome to suffer only. Such a dinner party would have been better had it\nnot been started at all.\n\nAfter a while, they began singing ditties in outlandish voices. One of\nthe geishas came in front of me, and taking up a samisen, asked me to\nsing something. I told her I didn't sing, but I'd like to hear, and she\ndroned out:\n\n\"If one can go round and meet the one he wants, banging gongs and drums\n...... bang, bang, bang, bang, bing, shouting after wandering Santaro,\nthere is some one I'd like to meet by banging round gongs and drums\n...... bang, bang, bang, bang, b-i-n-g.\"\n\nShe dashed this off in two breaths, and sighed, \"O, dear!\" She should\nhave sung something easier.\n\nClown who had come near us meanwhile, remarked in his flippant tone:\n\n\"Hello, dear Miss Su-chan, too bad to see your beau go away so soon.\"\nThe geisha pouted, \"I don't know.\" Clown, regardless, began imitating\n\"gidayu\" with a dismal voice,--\"What a luck, when she met her sweet\nheart by a rare chance....\"\n\nThe geisha slapped the lap of Clown with a \"Cut that out,\" and Clown\ngleefully laughed. This geisha is the one who made goo-goo eyes[J] at\nRed Shirt. What a simpleton, to be pleased by the slap of a geisha, this\nClown. He said:\n\n\"Say, Su-chan, strike up the string. I'm going to dance the Kiino-kuni.\"\nHe seemed yet to dance.\n\nOn other side of the room, the old man of Confucius, twisting round his\ntoothless mouth, had finished as far as \"...... dear Dembei-san\" and is\nasking a geisha who sat in front of him to couch him for the rest. Old\npeople seem to need polishing up their memorizing system. One geisha is\ntalking to the teacher of natural history:\n\n\"Here's the latest. I'll sing it. Just listen. 'Margaret, the\nhigh-collared head with a white ribbon; she rides on a bike, plays a\nviolin, and talks in broken English,--I am glad to see you.'\" Natural\nhistory appears impressed, and says;\n\n\"That's an interesting piece. English in it too.\"\n\nPorcupine called \"geisha, geisha,\" in a loud voice, and commanded; \"Bang\nyour samisen; I'm going to dance a sword-dance.\"\n\nHis manner was so rough that the geishas were startled and did not\nanswer. Porcupine, unconcerned, brought out a cane, and began performing\nthe sword-dance in the center of the room. Then Clown, having danced the\nKii-no-kuni, the Kap-pore[K] and the Durhma-san on the Shelf, almost\nstark-naked, with a palm-fibre broom, began turkey-trotting about the\nroom, shouting \"The Sino-Japanese negotiations came to a break.......\"\nThe whole was a crazy sight.\n\nI had been feeling sorry for Hubbard Squash, who up to this time had sat\nup straight in his full dress. Even were this a farewell dinner held in\nhis honor, I thought he was under no obligation to look patiently in a\nformal dress at the naked dance. So I went to him and persuaded him with\n\"Say, Koga-san, let's go home.\" Hubbard Squash said the dinner was in\nhis honor, and it would be improper for him to leave the room before the\nguests. He seemed to be determined to remain.\n\n\"What do you care!\" I said, \"If this is a farewell dinner, make it like\none. Look at those fellows; they're just like the inmates of a lunatic\nasylum. Let's go.\"\n\nAnd having forced hesitating Hubbard Squash to his feet, we were\njust leaving the room, when Clown, marching past, brandishing the\nbroom, saw us.\n\n\"This won't do for the guest of honor to leave before us,\" he hollered,\n\"this is the Sino-Japanese negotiations. Can't let you off.\" He enforced\nhis declaration by holding the broom across our way. My temper had been\npretty well aroused for some time, and I felt impatient.\n\n\"The Sino-Japanese negotiation, eh? Then you're a Chink,\" and I whacked\nhis head with a knotty fist.\n\nThis sudden blow left Clown staring blankly speechless for a second or\ntwo; then he stammered out:\n\n\"This is going some! Mighty pity to knock my head. What a blow on this\nYoshikawa! This makes the Sino-Japanese negotiations the sure stuff.\"\n\nWhile Clown was mumbling these incoherent remarks, Porcupine, believing\nsome kind of row had been started, ceased his sword-dance and came\nrunning toward us. On seeing us, he grabbed the neck of Clown and\npulled him back.\n\n\"The Sino-Japane......ouch!......ouch! This is outrageous,\" and Clown\nwrithed under the grip of Porcupine who twisted him sideways and threw\nhim down on the floor with a bang. I do not know the rest. I parted from\nHubbard Squash on the way, and it was past eleven when I returned home.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\nThe town is going to celebrate a Japanese victory to-day, and there is\nno school. The celebration is to be held at the parade ground, and\nBadger is to take out all the students and attend the ceremony. As one\nof the instructors, I am to go with them. The streets are everywhere\ndraped with flapping national flags almost enough to dazzle the eyes.\nThere were as many as eight hundred students in all, and it was\narranged, under the direction of the teacher of physical culture to\ndivide them into sections with one teacher or two to lead them. The\narrangement itself was quite commendable, but in its actual operation\nthe whole thing went wrong. All students are mere kiddies who, ever too\nfresh, regard it as beneath their dignity not to break all regulations.\nThis rendered the provision of teachers among them practically useless.\nThey would start marching songs without being told to, and if they\nceased the marching songs, they would raise devilish shouts without\ncause. Their behavior would have done credit to the gang of tramps\nparading the streets demanding work. When they neither sing nor shout,\nthey tee-hee and giggle. Why they cannot walk without these disorder,\npasses my understanding, but all Japanese are born with their mouths\nstuck out, and no kick will ever be strong enough to stop it. Their\nchatter is not only of simple nature, but about the teachers when their\nback is turned. What a degraded bunch! I made the students apologize to\nme on the dormitory affair, and considered the incident closed. But I\nwas mistaken. To borrow the words of the old lady in the boarding house,\nI was surely wrong Mr. Wright. The apology they offered was not prompted\nby repentance in their hearts. They had kowtowed as a matter of form by\nthe command of the principal. Like the tradespeople who bow their heads\nlow but never give up cheating the public, the students apologize but\nnever stop their mischiefs. Society is made up, I think it probable, of\npeople just like those students. One may be branded foolishly honest if\nhe takes seriously the apologies others might offer. We should regard\nall apologies a sham and forgiving also as a sham; then everything would\nbe all right. If one wants to make another apologize from his heart, he\nhas to pound him good and strong until he begs for mercy from his heart.\n\nAs I walked along between the sections, I could hear constantly the\nvoices mentioning \"tempura\" or \"dango.\" And as there were so many of\nthem, I could not tell which one mentioned it. Even if I succeeded in\ncollaring the guilty one I was sure of his saying, \"No, I didn't mean\nyou in saying tempura or dango. I fear you suffer from nervousness and\nmake wrong inferences.\" This dastardly spirit has been fostered from the\ntime of the feudal lords, and is deep-rooted. No amount of teaching or\nlecturing will cure it. If I stay in a town like this for one year or\nso, I may be compelled to follow their example, who knows,--clean and\nhonest though I have been. I do not propose to make a fool of myself by\nremaining quiet when others attempt to play games on me, with all their\nexcuses ready-made. They are men and so am I--students or kiddies or\nwhatever they may be. They are bigger than I, and unless I get even with\nthem by punishment, I would cut a sorry figure. But in the attempt to\nget even, if I resort to ordinary means, they are sure to make it a\nboomerang. If I tell them, \"You're wrong,\" they will start an eloquent\ndefence, because they are never short of the means of sidestepping.\nHaving defended themselves, and made themselves appear suffering\nmartyrs, they would begin attacking me. As the incident would have been\nstarted by my attempting to get even with them, my defence would not be\na defence until I can prove their wrong. So the quarrel, which they had\nstarted, might be mistaken, after all, as one begun by me. But the more\nI keep silent the more they would become insolent, which, speaking\nseriously, could not be permitted for the sake of public morale. In\nconsequence, I am obliged to adopt an identical policy so they cannot\ncatch men in playing it back on them. If the situation comes to that, it\nwould be the last day of the Yedo kid. Even so, if I am to be subjected\nto these pin-pricking[L] tricks, I am a man and got to risk losing off\nthe last remnant of the honor of the Yedo kid. I became more convinced\nof the advisability of returning to Tokyo quickly and living with Kiyo.\nTo live long in such a countrytown would be like degrading myself for a\npurpose. Newspaper delivering would be preferable to being degraded so\nfar as that.\n\nI walked along with a sinking heart, thinking like this, when the head\nof our procession became suddenly noisy, and the whole came to a full\nstop. I thought something has happened, stepped to the right out of the\nranks, and looked toward the direction of the noise. There on the corner\nof Otemachi, turning to Yakushimachi, I saw a mass packed full like\ncanned sardines, alternately pushing back and forth. The teacher of\nphysical culture came down the line hoarsely shouting to all to be\nquiet. I asked him what was the matter, and he said the middle school\nand the normal had come to a clash at the corner.\n\nThe middle school and the normal, I understood, are as much friendly as\ndogs and monkeys. It is not explained why but their temper was\nhopelessly crossed, and each would try to knock the chip off the\nshoulder of the other on all occasions. I presume they quarrel so much\nbecause life gets monotonous in this backwoods town. I am fond of\nfighting, and hearing of the clash, darted forward to make the most of\nthe fun. Those foremost in the line are jeering, \"Get out of the way,\nyou country tax!\"[12] while those in the rear are hollowing \"Push them\nout!\" I passed through the students, and was nearing the corner, when I\nheard a sharp command of \"Forward!\" and the line of the normal school\nbegan marching on. The clash which had resulted from contending for the\nright of way was settled, but it was settled by the middle school giving\nway to the normal. From the point of school-standing the normal is said\nto rank above the middle.\n\n[Footnote 12: The normal school in the province maintains the students\nmostly on the advance-expense system, supported by the country tax.]\n\nThe ceremony was quite simple. The commander of the local brigade read a\ncongratulatory address, and so did the governor, and the audience\nshouted banzais. That was all. The entertainments were scheduled for the\nafternoon, and I returned home once and started writing to Kiyo an\nanswer which had been in my mind for some days. Her request had been\nthat I should write her a letter with more detailed news; so I must get\nit done with care. But as I took up the rolled letter-paper, I did not\nknow with what I should begin, though I have many things to write about.\n\nShould I begin with that? That is too much trouble. Or with this? It is\nnot interesting. Isn't there something which will come out smoothly, I\nreflected, without taxing my head too much, and which will interest\nKiyo. There seemed, however, no such item as I wanted I grated the\nink-cake, wetted the writing brush, stared at the letter-paper--stared\nat the letter-paper, wetted the writing brush, grated the ink-cake--and,\nhaving repeated the same thing several times, I gave up the letter\nwriting as not in my line, and covered the lid of the stationery box. To\nwrite a letter was a bother. It would be much simpler to go back to\nTokyo and see Kiyo. Not that I am unconcerned about the anxiety of Kiyo,\nbut to get up a letter to please the fancy of Kiyo is a harder job than\nto fast for three weeks.\n\nI threw down the brush and letter-paper, and lying down with my bent\narms as a pillow, gazed at the garden. But the thought of the letter to\nKiyo would come back in my mind. Then I thought this way; If I am\nthinking of her from my heart, even at such a distance, my sincerity\nwould find responsive appreciation in Kiyo. If it does find response,\nthere is no need of sending letters. She will regard the absence of\nletters from me as a sign of my being in good health. If I write in case\nof illness or when something unusual happens, that will be sufficient.\n\nThe garden is about thirty feet square, with no particular plants worthy\nof name. There is one orange tree which is so tall as to be seen above\nthe board fence from outside. Whenever I returned from the school I used\nto look at this orange tree. For to those who had not been outside of\nTokyo, oranges on the tree are rather a novel sight. Those oranges now\ngreen will ripen by degrees and turn to yellow, when the tree would\nsurely be beautiful. There are some already ripened. The old lady told\nme that they are juicy, sweet oranges. \"They will all soon be ripe, and\nthen help yourself to all you want,\" she said. I think I will enjoy a\nfew every day. They will be just right in about three weeks. I do not\nthink I will have to leave the town in so short a time as three weeks.\n\nWhile my attention was centered on the oranges, Porcupine[M] came in.\n\n\"Say, to-day being the celebration[N] of victory, I thought I would get\nsomething good to eat with you, and bought some beef.\"\n\nSo saying, he took out a package covered with a bamboo-wrapper, and\nthrew it down in the center of the room. I had been denied the pleasure\nof patronizing the noodle house or dango shop, on top of getting sick of\nthe sweet potatoes and tofu, and I welcomed the suggestion with \"That's\nfine,\" and began cooking it with a frying pan and some sugar borrowed\nfrom the old lady.\n\nPorcupine, munching the beef to the full capacity of his mouth, asked me\nif I knew Red Shirt having a favorite geisha. I asked if that was not\none of the geishas who came to our dinner the other night, and he\nanswered, \"Yes, I got the wind of the fact only recently; you're sharp.\"\n\n\"Red Shirt always speaks of refinement of character or of mental\nconsolation, but he is making a fool of himself by chasing round a\ngeisha. What a dandy rogue. We might let that go if he wouldn't make\nfuss about others making fools of themselves. I understand through the\nprincipal he stopped your going even to noodle houses or dango shops as\nunbecoming to the dignity of the school, didn't he?\"\n\n\"According to his idea, running after a geisha is a mental consolation\nbut tempura or dango is a material pleasure, I guess. If that's mental\nconsolation, why doesn't the fool do it above board? You ought to see\nthe jacknape skipping out of the room when the geisha came into it the\nother night,--I don't like his trying to deceive us, but if one were to\npoint it out for him, he would deny it or say it was the Russian\nliterature or that the haiku is a half-brother of the new poetry, and\nexpect to hush it up by twaddling soft nonsense. A weak-knee like him is\nnot a man. I believe he lived the life of a court-maid in former life.\nPerhaps his daddy might have been a kagema at Yushima in old days.\"\n\n\"What is a kagema?\"\n\n\"I suppose something very unmanly,--sort of emasculated chaps. Say, that\npart isn't cooked enough. It might give you tape worm.\"\n\n\"So? I think it's all right. And, say, Red Shirt is said to frequent\nKadoya at the springs town and meet his geisha there, but he keeps\nit in dark.\"\n\n\"Kadoya? That hotel?\"\n\n\"Also a restaurant. So we've got to catch him there with his geisha and\nmake it hot for him right to his face.\"\n\n\"Catch him there? Suppose we begin a kind of night watch?\"\n\n\"Yes, you know there is a rooming house called Masuya in front of\nKadoya. We'll rent one room upstairs of the house, and keep peeping\nthrough a loophole we could make in the shoji.\"\n\n\"Will he come when we keep peeping at him?\"\n\n\"He may. We will have to do it more than one night. Must expect to keep\nit up for at least two weeks.\"\n\n\"Say, that would make one pretty well tired, I tell you. I sat up every\nnight for about one week attending my father when he died, and it left\nme thoroughly down and out for some time afterward.\"\n\n\"I don't care if I do get tired some. A crook like Red Shirt should not\ngo unpunished that way for the honor of Japan, and I am going to\nadminister a chastisement in behalf of heaven.\"\n\n\"Hooray! If things are decided upon that way, I am game. And we are\ngoing to start from to-night?\"\n\n\"I haven't rented a room at Masuya yet, so can't start it to-night.\"\n\n\"Then when?\"\n\n\"Will start before long. I'll let you know, and want you help me.\"\n\n\"Right-O. I will help you any time. I am not much myself at scheming,\nbut I am IT when it comes to fighting.\"\n\nWhile Porcupine and I were discussing the plan of subjugating Red Shirt,\nthe old lady appeared at the door, announcing that a student was wanting\nto see Professor Hotta. The student had gone to his house, but seeing\nhim out, had come here as probable to find him. Porcupine went to the\nfront door himself, and returning to the room after a while, said:\n\n\"Say, the boy came to invite us to go and see the entertainment of the\ncelebration. He says there is a big bunch of dancers from Kochi to dance\nsomething, and it would be a long time before we could see the like of\nit again. Let's go.\"\n\nPorcupine seemed enthusiastic over the prospect of seeing that dance,\nand induced me to go with him. I have seen many kinds of dance in Tokyo.\nAt the annual festival of the Hachiman Shrine, moving stages come around\nthe district, and I have seen the Shiokukmi and almost any other\nvariety. I was little inclined to see that dance by the sturdy fellows\nfrom Tosa province, but as Porcupine was so insistent, I changed my mind\nand followed him out. I did not know the student who came to invite\nPorcupine, but found he was the younger brother of Red Shirt. Of all\nstudents, what a strange choice for a messenger!\n\nThe celebration ground was decorated, like the wrestling amphitheater at\nRyogoku during the season, or the annual festivity of the Hommonji\ntemple, with long banners planted here and there, and on the ropes that\ncrossed and recrossed in the mid-air were strung the colors of all\nnations, as if they were borrowed from as many nations for the occasion\nand the large roof presented unusually cheerful aspect. On the eastern\ncorner there was built a temporary stage upon which the dance of Koehi\nwas to be performed. For about half a block, with the stage on the\nright, there was a display of flowers and plant settings arranged on\nshelves sheltered with reed screens. Everybody was looking at the\ndisplay seemingly much impressed, but it failed to impress me. If\ntwisted grasses or bamboos afforded so much pleasure, the gallantry of a\nhunchback or the husband of a wrong pair should give as much pleasure to\ntheir eyes.\n\nIn the opposite direction, aerial bombs and fire works were steadily\ngoing on. A balloon shot out on which was written \"Long Live the\nEmpire!\" It floated leisurely over the pine trees near the castle\ntower, and fell down inside the compound of the barracks. Bang! A black\nball shot up against the serene autumn sky; burst open straight above\nmy head, streams of luminous green smoke ran down in an umbrella-shape,\nand finally faded. Then another balloon. It was red with \"Long Live the\nArmy and Navy\" in white. The wind slowly carried it from the town\ntoward the Aioi village. Probably it would fall into the yard of Kwanon\ntemple there.\n\nAt the formal celebration this morning there were not quite so many as\nhere now. It was surging mass that made me wonder how so many people\nlived in the place. There were not many attractive faces among the\ncrowd, but as far as the numerical strength went, it was a formidable\none. In the meantime that dance had begun. I took it for granted that\nsince they call it a dance, it would be something similar to the kind of\ndance by the Fujita troupe, but I was greatly mistaken.\n\nThirty fellows, dressed up in a martial style, in three rows of ten\neach, stood with glittering drawn swords. The sight was an eye-opener,\nindeed. The space between the rows measured about two feet, and that\nbetween the men might have been even less. One stood apart from the\ngroup. He was similarly dressed but instead of a drawn sword, he carried\na drum hung about his chest. This fellow drawled out signals the tone of\nwhich suggested a mighty easy-life, and then croaking a strange song, he\nwould strike the drum. The tune was outlandishly unfamiliar. One might\nform the idea by thinking it a combination of the Mikawa Banzai and the\nFudarakuya.\n\nThe song was drowsy, and like syrup in summer is dangling and slovenly.\nHe struck the drum to make stops at certain intervals. The tune was kept\nwith regular rhythmical order, though it appeared to have neither head\nnor tail. In response to this tune, the thirty drawn swords flash, with\nsuch dexterity and speed that the sight made the spectator almost\nshudder. With live men within two feet of their position, the sharp\ndrawn blades, each flashing them in the same manner, they looked as if\nthey might make a bloody mess unless they were perfectly accurate in\ntheir movements. If it had been brandishing swords alone without moving\nthemselves, the chances of getting slashed or cut might have been less,\nbut sometimes they would turn sideways together, or clear around, or\nbend their knees. Just one second's difference in the movement, either\ntoo quick or too late, on the part of the next fellow, might have meant\nsloughing off a nose or slicing off the head of the next fellow. The\ndrawn swords moved in perfect freedom, but the sphere of action was\nlimited to about two feet square, and to cap it all, each had to keep\nmoving with those in front and back, at right and left, in the same\ndirection at the same speed. This beats me! The dance of the Shiokumi or\nthe Sekinoto would make no show compared with this! I heard them say the\ndance requires much training, and it could not be an easy matter to make\nso many dancers move in a unison like this. Particularly difficult part\nin the dance was that of the fellow with drum stuck to his chest. The\nmovement of feet, action of hands, or bending of knees of those thirty\nfellows were entirely directed by the tune with which he kept them\ngoing. To the spectators this fellow's part appeared the easiest. He\nsang in a lazy tune, but it was strange that he was the fellow who takes\nthe heaviest responsibility.\n\nWhile Porcupine and I, deeply impressed, were looking at the dance with\nabsorbing interest, a sudden hue and cry was raised about half a block\noff. A commotion was started among those who had been quietly enjoying\nthe sights and all ran pell-mell in every direction. Some one was heard\nsaying \"fight!\" Then the younger brother of Red Shirt came running\nforward through the crowd.\n\n\"Please, Sir,\" he panted, \"a row again! The middles are going to get\neven with the normals and have just begun fighting. Come quick, Sir!\"\nAnd he melted somewhere into the crowd.\n\n\"What troublesome brats! So they're at it again, eh? Why can't\nthey stop it!\"\n\nPorcupine, as he spoke, dashed forward, dodging among the running crowd.\nHe meant, I think, to stop the fight, because he could not be an idle\nspectator once he was informed of the fact. I of course had no intention\nof turning tail, and hastened on the heels of Porcupine. The fight was\nin its fiercest. There were about fifty to sixty normals, and the\nmiddles numbered by some ninety. The normals wore uniform, but the\nmiddles had discarded their uniform and put on Japanese civilian\nclothes, which made the distinction between the two hostile camps easy.\nBut they were so mixed up, and wrangling with such violence, that we did\nnot know how and where we could separate them.\n\nPorcupine, apparently at a loss what to do, looked at the wild scene\nawhile, then turned to me, saying:\n\n\"Let's jump in and separate them. It will be hell if cops get on them.\"\n\nI did not answer, but rushed to the spot where the scuffle appeared\nmost violent.\n\n\"Stop there! Cut this out! You're ruining the name of the school! Stop\nthis, dash you!\"\n\nShouting at the top of my voice, I attempted to penetrate the line which\nseemed to separate the hostile sides, but this attempt did not succeed.\nWhen about ten feet into the turmoil, I could neither advance nor\nretreat. Right in my front, a comparatively large normal was grappling\nwith a middle about sixteen years of ago.\n\n\"Stop that!\"\n\nI grabbed the shoulder of the normal and tried to force them apart when\nsome one whacked my feet. On this sudden attack, I let go the normal and\nfell down sideways. Some one stepped on my back with heavy shoes. With\nboth hands and knees upon the ground, I jumped up and the fellow on my\nback rolled off to my right. I got up, and saw the big body of Porcupine\nabout twenty feet away, sandwiched between the students, being pushed\nback and forth, shouting, \"Stop the fight! Stop that!\"\n\n\"Say, we can't do anything!\" I hollered at him, but unable to hear, I\nthink, he did not answer.\n\nA pebble-stone whiffled through the air and hit squarely on my cheek\nbone; the same moment some one banged my back with a heavy stick\nfrom behind.\n\n\"Profs mixing in!\" \"Knock them down!\" was shouted.\n\n\"Two of them; big one and small. Throw stones at them!\" Another shout.\n\n\"Drat you fresh jackanapes!\" I cried as I wallopped the head of a normal\nnearby. Another stone grazed my head, and passed behind me. I did not\nknow what had become of Porcupine, I could not find him. Well, I could\nnot help it but jumped into the teapot to stop the tempest. I wasn't[O]\na Hottentot to skulk away on being shot at with pebble-stones. What did\nthey think I was anyway! I've been through all kinds of fighting in\nTokyo, and can take in all fights one may care to give me. I slugged,\njabbed and banged the stuffing out of the fellow nearest to me. Then\nsome one cried, \"Cops! Cops! Cheese it! Beat it!\" At that moment, as if\nwading through a pond of molasses, I could hardly move, but the next I\nfelt suddenly released and both sides scampered off simultaneously. Even\nthe country fellows do creditable work when it comes to retreating, more\nmasterly than General Kuropatkin, I might say.\n\nI searched for Porcupine who, I found his overgown torn to shreds, was\nwiping his nose. He bled considerably, and his nose having swollen was a\nsight. My clothes were pretty well massed with dirt, but I had not\nsuffered quite as much damage as Porcupine. I felt pain in my cheek and\nas Porcupine said, it bled some.\n\nAbout sixteen police officers arrived at the scene but, all the students\nhaving beat it in opposite directions, all they were able to catch were\nPorcupine and me. We gave them our names and explained the whole story.\nThe officers requested us to follow them to the police station which we\ndid, and after stating to the chief of police what had happened, we\nreturned home.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\nThe next morning on awakening I felt pains all over my body, due, I\nthought, to having had no fight for a long time. This is not creditable\nto my fame as regards fighting, so I thought while in bed, when the old\nlady brought me a copy of the Shikoku Shimbun. I felt so weak as to need\nsome effort even reaching for the paper. But what should be man so\neasily upset by such a trifling affair,--so I forced myself to turn in\nbed, and, opening its second page, I was surprised. There was the whole\nstory of the fight of yesterday in print. Not that I was surprised by\nthe news of the fight having been published, but it said that one\nteacher Hotta of the Middle School and one certain saucy Somebody,\nrecently from Tokyo, of the same institution, not only started this\ntrouble by inciting the students, but were actually present at the scene\nof the trouble, directing the students and engaged themselves against\nthe students of the Normal School. On top of this, something of the\nfollowing effect was added.\n\n\"The Middle School in this prefecture has been an object of admiration\nby all other schools for its good and ideal behavior. But since this\nlong-cherished honor has been sullied by these two irresponsible\npersons, and this city made to suffer the consequent indignity, we have\nto bring the perpetrators to full account. We trust that before we take\nany step in this matter, the authorities will have those 'toughs'\nproperly punished, barring them forever from our educational circles.\"\n\nAll the types were italicized, as if they meant to administer\ntypographical chastisement upon us. \"What the devil do I care!\" I\nshouted, and up I jumped out of bed. Strange to say, the pain in my\njoints became tolerable.\n\nI rolled up the newspaper and threw it into the garden. Not satisfied, I\ntook that paper to the cesspool and dumped it there. Newspapers tell\nsuch reckless lies. There is nothing so adept, I believe, as the\nnewspaper in circulating lies. It has said what I should have said. And\nwhat does it mean by \"one saucy Somebody who is recently from Tokyo?\" Is\nthere any one in this wide world with the name of Somebody? Don't\nforget, I have a family and personal name of my own which I am proud of.\nIf they want to look at my family-record, they will bow before every one\nof my ancestors from Mitsunaka Tada down. Having washed my face, my\ncheek began suddenly smarting. I asked the old lady for a mirror, and\nshe asked if I had read the paper of this morning. \"Yes,\" I said, \"and\ndumped it in the cesspool; go and pick it up if you want it,\"--and she\nwithdrew with a startled look. Looking in the mirror, I saw bruises on\nmy cheek. Mine is a precious face to me. I get my face bruised, and am\ncalled a saucy Somebody as if I were nobody. That is enough.\n\nIt will be a reflection on my honor to the end of my days if it is said\nthat I shunned the public gaze and kept out of the school on account of\nthe write-up in the paper. So, after the breakfast, I attended the\nschool ahead of all. One after the other, all coming to the school would\ngrin at my face. What is there to laugh about! This face is my own,\ngotten up, I am sure, without the least obligation on their part. By and\nby, Clown appeared.\n\n\"Ha, heroic action yesterday. Wounds of honor, eh?\"\n\nHe made this sarcastic remark, I suppose, in revenge for the knock he\nreceived on his head from me at the farewell dinner.\n\n\"Cut out nonsense; you get back there and suck your old drawing\nbrushes!\" Then he answered \"that was going some,\" and enquired if it\npained much?\n\n\"Pain or no pain, this is my face. That's none of your business,\" I\nsnapped back in a furious temper. Then Clown took his seat on the other\nside, and still keeping his eye on me, whispered and laughed with the\nteacher of history next to him.\n\nThen came Porcupine. His nose had swollen and was purple,--it was a\ntempting object for a surgeon's knife. His face showed far worse (is it\nmy conceit that make this comparison?) than mine. I and Porcupine are\nchums with desks next to each other, and moreover, as ill-luck would\nhave it, the desks are placed right facing the door. Thus were two\nstrange faces placed together. The other fellows, when in want of\nsomething to divert them, would gaze our way with regularity. They say\n\"too bad,\" but they are surely laughing in their minds as \"ha, these\nfools!\" If that is not so, there is no reason for their whispering\ntogether and grinning like that. In the class room, the boys clapped\ntheir hands when I entered; two or three of them banzaied. I could not\ntell whether it was an enthusiastic approval or open insult. While I and\nPorcupine were thus being made the cynosures of the whole school, Red\nShirt came to me as usual.\n\n\"Too bad, my friend; I am very sorry indeed for you gentlemen,\" he said\nin a semi-apologetic manner. \"I've talked with the principal in regard\nto the story in the paper, and have arranged to demand that the paper\nretract the report, so you needn't worry on that score. You were plunged\ninto the trouble because my brother invited Mr. Hotta, and I don't know\nhow I can apologize you! I'm going to do my level best in this matter;\nyou gentlemen please depend on that.\" At the third hour recess the\nprincipal came out of his room, and seemed more or less perturbed,\nsaying, \"The paper made a bad mess of it, didn't it? I hope the matter\nwill not become serious.\"\n\nAs to anxiety, I have none. If they propose to relieve me, I intend\nto tender my resignation before I get fired,--that's all. However, if\nI resign with no fault on my part, I would be simply giving the paper\nadvantage. I thought it proper to make the paper take back what it\nhad said, and stick to my position. I was going to the newspaper\noffice to give them a piece of my mind on my way back but having been\ntold that the school had already taken steps to have the story\nretracted, I did not.\n\nPorcupine and I saw the principal and Red Shirt at a convenient hour,\ngiving them a faithful version of the incident. The principal and Red\nShirt agreed that the incident must have been as we said and that the\npaper bore some grudge against the school and purposely published such a\nstory. Red Shirt made a round of personal visits on each teacher in the\nroom, defending and explaining our action in the affair. Particularly he\ndwelt upon the fact that his brother invited Porcupine and it was his\nfault. All teachers denounced the paper as infamous and agreed that we\ntwo deserved sympathy.\n\nOn our way home, Porcupine warned me that Red Shirt smelt suspicious,\nand we would be done unless we looked out. I said he had been smelling\nsome anyway,--it was not necessarily so just from to-day. Then he said\nthat it was his trick to have us invited and mixed in the fight\nyesterday,--\"Aren't you on to that yet?\" Well, I was not. Porcupine was\nquite a Grobian but he was endowed, I was impressed, with a better\nbrain than I.\n\n\"He made us mix into the trouble, and slipped behind and contrived to\nhave the paper publish the story. What a devil!\"\n\n\"Even the newspaper in the band wagon of Red Shirt? That surprises me.\nBut would the paper listen to Red Shirt so easily?\"\n\n\"Wouldn't it, though. Darn easy thing if one has friends in the\npaper.\"[P]\n\n\"Has he any?\"\n\n\"Suppose he hasn't, still that's easy. Just tell lies and say such and\nsuch are facts, and the paper will take it up.\"\n\n\"A startling revelation, this. If that was really a trick of Red Shirt,\nwe're likely to be discharged on account of this affair.\"\n\n\"Quite likely we may be discharged.\"\n\n\"Then I'll tender my resignation tomorrow, and back to Tokyo I go. I am\nsick of staying in such a wretched hole.\"\n\n\"Your resignation wouldn't make Red Shirt squeal.\"\n\n\"That's so. How can he be made to squeal?\"\n\n\"A wily guy like him always plots not to leave any trace behind, and it\nwould be difficult to follow his track.\"\n\n\"What a bore! Then we have to stand in a false light, eh? Damn it! I\ncall all kinds of god to witness if this is just and right!\"\n\n\"Let's wait for two or three days and see how it turns out. And if\nwe can't do anything else, we will have to catch him at the hot\nsprings town.\"\n\n\"Leaving this fight affair a separate case?\"\n\n\"Yes. We'll have to his hit weak spot with our own weapon.\"\n\n\"That may be good. I haven't much to say in planning it out; I leave it\nto you and will do anything at your bidding.\"\n\nI parted from Porcupine then. If Red Shirt was really instrumental in\nbringing us two into the trouble as Porcupine supposed, he certainly\ndeserves to be called down. Red Shirt outranks us in brainy work. And\nthere is no other course open but to appeal to physical force. No wonder\nwe never see the end of war in the world. Among individuals, it is,\nafter all, the question of superiority of the fist.\n\nNext day I impatiently glanced over the paper, the arrival of which I\nhad been waiting with eagerness, but not a correction of the news or\neven a line of retraction could be found. I pressed the matter on\nBadger when I went to the school, and he said it might probably appear\ntomorrow. On that \"tomorrow\" a line of retraction was printed in tiny\ntypes. But the paper did not make any correction of the story. I called\nthe attention of Badger to the fact, and he replied that that was about\nall that could be done under the circumstance. The principal, with the\nface like a badger and always swaggering, is surprisingly, wanting in\ninfluence. He has not even as much power as to bring down a country\nnewspaper, which had printed a false story. I was so thoroughly\nindignant that I declared I would go alone to the office and see the\neditor-in-chief on the subject, but Badger said no.\n\n\"If you go there and have a blowup with the editor,\" he continued, \"it\nwould only mean of your being handed out worse stuff in the paper again.\nWhatever is published in a paper, right or wrong, nothing can be done\nwith it.\" And he wound up with a remark that sounded like a piece of\nsermon by a Buddhist bonze that \"We must be contented by speedily\ndespatching the matter from our minds and forgetting it.\"\n\nIf newspapers are of that character, it would be beneficial for us all\nto have them suspended,--the sooner the better. The similarity of the\nunpleasant sensation of being written-up in a paper and being\nbitten-down by a turtle became plain for the first time by the\nexplanation of Badger.\n\nAbout three days afterward, Porcupine came to me excited, and said that\nthe time has now come, that he proposes to execute that thing we had\nplanned out. Then I will do so, I said, and readily agreed to join him.\nBut Porcupine jerked his head, saying that I had better not. I asked him\nwhy, and he asked if I had been requested by the principal to tender my\nresignation. No, I said, and asked if he had. He told me that he was\ncalled by the principal who was very, very sorry for him but under the\ncircumstance requested him to decide to resign.\n\n\"That isn't fair. Badger probably had been pounding his belly-drum too\nmuch and his stomach is upside down,\" I said, \"you and I went to the\ncelebration, looked at the glittering sword dance together, and jumped\ninto the fight together to stop it. Wasn't it so? If he wants you to\ntender your resignation, he should be impartial and should have asked me\nto also. What makes everything in the country school so dull-head. This\nis irritating!\"\n\n\"That's wire-pulling by Red Shirt,\" he said. \"I and Red Shirt cannot go\nalong together, but they think you can be left as harmless.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't get along with that Red Shirt either. Consider me harmless,\neh? They're getting too gay with me.\"\n\n\"You're so simple and straight that they think they can handle you in\nany old way.\"\n\n\"Worse still. I wouldn't get along with him, I tell you.\"\n\n\"Besides, since the departure of Koga, his successor has not arrived.\nFurthermore, if they fire me and you together, there will be blank spots\nin the schedule hours at the school.\"\n\n\"Then they expect me to play their game. Darn the fellow! See if they\ncan make me.\"\n\nOn going to the school next day I made straightway for the room of the\nprincipal and started firing;\n\n\"Why don't you ask me to put in my resignation?\" I said.\n\n\"Eh?\" Badger stared blankly.\n\n\"You requested Hotta to resign, but not me. Is that right?\"\n\n\"That is on account of the condition of the school......\"\n\n\"That condition is wrong, I dare say. If I don't have to resign, there\nshould be no necessity for Hotta to resign either.\"\n\n\"I can't offer a detailed explanation about that......as to Hotta, it\ncannot be helped if he goes...... ......we see no need of your\nresigning.\"\n\nIndeed, he is a badger. He jabbers something, dodging the point, but\nappears complacent. So I had to say:\n\n\"Then, I will tender my resignation. You might have thought that I\nwould remain peacefully while Mr. Hotta is forced to resign, but I\ncannot do it\"\n\n\"That leaves us in a bad fix. If Hotta goes away and you follow him, we\ncan't teach mathematics here.\"\n\n\"None of my business if you can't.\"\n\n\"Say, don't be so selfish. You ought to consider the condition of the\nschool. Besides, if it is said that you resigned within one month of\nstarting a new job, it would affect your record in the future. You\nshould consider that point also.\"\n\n\"What do I care about my record. Obligation is more important\nthan record.\"\n\n\"That's right. What you say is right, but be good enough to take our\nposition into consideration. If you insist on resigning, then resign,\nbut please stay until we get some one to take your place. At any rate,\nthink the matter over once more, please.\"\n\nThe reason was so plain as to discourage any attempt to think it over,\nbut as I took some pity on Badger whose face reddened or paled\nalternately as he spoke, I withdrew on the condition that I would think\nthe matter over. I did not talk with Red Shirt. If I have to land him\none, it was better, I thought, to have it bunched together and make it\nhot and strong.\n\nI acquainted Porcupine with the details of my meeting with Badger. He\nsaid he had expected it to be about so, and added that the matter of\nresignation can be left alone without causing me any embarrassment\nuntil the time comes. So I followed his advice. Porcupine appears\nsomewhat smarter than I, and I have decided to accept whatever advices\nhe may give.\n\nPorcupine finally tendered his resignation, and having bidden farewell\nof all the fellow teachers, went down to Minato-ya on the beach. But he\nstealthily returned to the hot springs town, and having rented a front\nroom upstairs of Masuya, started peeping through the hole he fingered\nout in the shoji. I am the only person who knows of this. If Red Shirt\ncomes round, it would be night anyway, and as he is liable to be seen by\nstudents or some others during the early part in the evening, it would\nsurely be after nine. For the first two nights, I was on the watch till\nabout 11 o'clock, but no sight of Red Shirt was seen. On the third\nnight, I kept peeping through from nine to ten thirty, but he did not\ncome. Nothing made me feel more like a fool than returning to the\nboarding house at midnight after a fruitless watch. In four or five\ndays, our old lady began worrying about me and advised me to quit night\nprowling,--being married. My night prowling is different from that kind\nof night prowling. Mine is that of administering a deserved\nchastisement. But then, when no encouragement is in sight after one\nweek, it becomes tiresome. I am quick tempered, and get at it with all\nzeal when my interest is aroused, and would sit up all night to work it\nout, but I have never shone in endurance. However loyal a member of the\nheavenly-chastisement league I may be, I cannot escape monotony. On the\nsixth night I was a little tired, and on the seventh thought I would\nquit. Porcupine, however, stuck to it with bull-dog tenacity. From early\nin the evening up to past twelve, he would glue his eye to the shoji and\nkeep steadily watching under the gas globe of Kadoya. He would surprise\nme, when I come into the room, with figures showing how many patrons\nthere were to-day, how many stop-overs and how many women, etc. Red\nShirt seems never to be coming, I said, and he would fold his arms,\naudibly sighing, \"Well, he ought to.\" If Red Shirt would not come just\nfor once, Porcupine would be deprived of the chance of handing out a\ndeserved and just punishment.\n\nI left my boarding house about 7 o'clock on the eighth night and after\nhaving enjoyed my bath, I bought eight raw eggs. This would counteract\nthe attack of sweet potatoes by the old lady. I put the eggs into my\nright and left pockets, four in each, with the same old red towel hung\nover my shoulder, my hands inside my coat, went to Masuya. I opened the\nshoji of the room and Porcupine greeted me with his Idaten-like face\nsuddenly radiant, saying:\n\n\"Say, there's hope! There's hope!\" Up to last night, he had been\ndowncast, and even I felt gloomy. But at his cheerful countenance, I too\nbecame cheerful, and before hearing anything, I cried, \"Hooray! Hooray!\"\n\n\"About half past seven this evening,\" he said, \"that geisha named Kosuzu\nhas gone into Kadoya.\"\n\n\"With Red Shirt?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"That's no good then.\"\n\n\"There were two geishas......seems to me somewhat hopeful.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"How? Why, the sly old fox is likely to send his girls ahead[Q], and\nsneak round behind later.\"\n\n\"That may be the case. About nine now, isn't it?\"\n\n\"About twelve minutes past nine,\" said he, pulling out a watch with\na nickel case, \"and, say put out the light. It would be funny to\nhave two silhouettes of bonze heads on the shoji. The fox is too\nready to suspect.\"\n\nI blew out the lamp which stood upon the lacquer-enameled table. The\nshoji alone was dimly plain by the star light. The moon has not come up\nyet. I and Porcupine put our faces close to the shoji, watching almost\nbreathless. A wall clock somewhere rang half past nine.\n\n\"Say, will he come to-night, do you think? If he doesn't show up, I\nquit.\"\n\n\"I'm going to keep this up while my money lasts.\"\n\n\"Money? How much have you?\"\n\n\"I've paid five yen and sixty sen up to to-day for eight days. I pay my\nbill every night, so I can jump out anytime.\"\n\n\"That's well arranged. The people of this hotel must have been rather\nput out, I suppose.\"\n\n\"That's all right with the hotel; only I can't take my mind off\nthe house.\"\n\n\"But you take some sleep in daytime.\"\n\n\"Yes, I take a nap, but it's nuisance because I can't go out.\"\n\n\"Heavenly chastisement is a hard job, I'm sure,\" I said. \"If he gives\nus the slip after giving us such trouble, it would have been a\nthankless task.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm sure he will come to-night...--... Look, look!\" His voice\nchanged to whisper and I was alert in a moment. A fellow with a black\nhat looked up at the gas light of Kadoya and passed on into the\ndarkness. No, it was not Red Shirt. Disappointing, this! Meanwhile the\nclock at the office below merrily tinkled off ten. It seems to be\nanother bum watch to-night.\n\nThe streets everywhere had become quiet. The drum playing in the\ntenderloin reached our ears distinctively. The moon had risen from\nbehind the hills of the hot springs. It is very light outside. Then\nvoices were heard below. We could not poke our heads out of the window,\nso were unable to see the owners of the voices, but they were evidently\ncoming nearer. The dragging of komageta (a kind of wooden footwear) was\nheard. They approached so near we could see their shadows.\n\n\"Everything is all right now. We've got rid of the stumbling block.\" It\nwas undoubtedly the voice of Clown.\n\n\"He only glories in bullying but has no tact.\" This from Red Shirt.\n\n\"He is like that young tough, isn't he? Why, as to that young tough, he\nis a winsome, sporty Master Darling.\"\n\n\"I don't want my salary raised, he says, or I want to tender\nresignation,--I'm sure something is wrong with his nerves.\"\n\nI was greatly inclined to open the window, jump out of the second story\nand make them see more stars than they cared to, but I restrained myself\nwith some effort. The two laughed, and passed below the gas light, and\ninto Kadoya.\n\n\"Say.\"\n\n\"Well.\"\n\n\"He's here.\"\n\n\"Yes, he has come at last.\"\n\n\"I feel quite easy now.\"\n\n\"Damned Clown called me a sporty Master Darling.\"\n\n\"The stumbling[R] block means me. Hell!\"\n\nI and Porcupine had to waylay them on their return. But we knew no more\nthan the man in the moon when they would come out. Porcupine went down\nto the hotel office, notifying them to the probability of our going out\nat midnight, and requesting them to leave the door unfastened so we\ncould get out anytime. As I think about it now, it is wonderful how the\nhotel people complied with our request. In most cases, we would have\nbeen taken for burglars.\n\nIt was trying to wait for the coming of Red Shirt, but it was still more\ntrying to wait for his coming out again. We could not go to sleep, nor\ncould we remain with our faces stuck to the shoji all the time our minds\nconstantly in a state of feverish agitation. In all my life, I never\npassed such fretful, mortifying hours. I suggested that we had better go\nright into his room and catch him but Porcupine rejected the proposal\noutright. If we get in there at this time of night, we are likely to be\nprevented from preceding much further, he said, and if we ask to see\nhim, they will either answer that he is not there or will take us into a\ndifferent room. Supposing we do break into a room, we cannot tell of all\nthose many rooms, where we can find him. There is no other way but to\nwait for him to come out, however tiresome it may be. So we sat up till\nfive in the morning.\n\nThe moment we saw them emerging from Kadoya, I and Porcupine followed\nthem. It was some time before the first train started and they had to\nwalk up to town. Beyond the limit of the hot springs town, there is a\nroad for about one block running through the rice fields, both sides of\nwhich are lined with cedar trees. Farther on are thatch-roofed farm\nhouses here and there, and then one comes upon a dyke leading straight\nto the town through the fields. We can catch them anywhere outside the\ntown, but thinking it would be better to get them, if possible, on the\nroad lined with cedar trees where we may not be seen by others, we\nfollowed them cautiously. Once out of the town limit, we darted on a\ndouble-quick time, and caught up with them. Wondering what was coming\nafter them, they turned back, and we grabbed their shoulders. We cried,\n\"Wait!\" Clown, greatly rattled, attempted to escape, but I stepped in\nfront of him to cut off his retreat.\n\n\"What makes one holding the job of a head teacher stay over night at\nKadoya!\" Porcupine directly fired the opening gun.\n\n\"Is there any rule that a head teacher should not stay over night at\nKadoya?\" Red Shirt met the attack in a polite manner. He looked a\nlittle pale.\n\n\"Why the one who is so strict as to forbid others from going even to\nnoodle house or dango shop as unbecoming to instructors, stayed over\nnight at a hotel with a geisha!\"\n\nClown was inclined to run at the first opportunity; so kept I\nbefore him.\n\n\"What's that Master Darling of a young tough!\" I roared.\n\n\"I didn't mean you. Sir. No, Sir, I didn't mean you, sure.\" He insisted\non this brazen excuse. I happened to notice at that moment that I had\nheld my pockets with both hands. The eggs in both pockets jerked so when\nI ran, that I had been holding them, I thrust my hand into the pocket,\ntook out two and dashed them on the face of Clown. The eggs crushed, and\nfrom the tip of his nose the yellow streamed down. Clown was taken\ncompletely surprised, and uttering a hideous cry, he fell down on the\nground and begged for mercy. I had bought those eggs to eat, but had not\ncarried them for the purpose of making \"Irish Confetti\" of them.\nThoroughly roused, in the moment of passion, I had dashed them at him\nbefore I knew what I was doing. But seeing Clown down and finding my\nhand grenade successful, I banged the rest of the eggs on him,\nintermingled with \"Darn you, you sonovagun!\" The face of Clown was\nsoaked in yellow.\n\nWhile I was bombarding Clown with the eggs, Porcupine was firing at\nRed[S] Shirt.\n\n\"Is there any evidence that I stayed there over night with a geisha?\"\n\n\"I saw your favorite old chicken go there early in the evening, and am\ntelling you so. You can't fool me!\"\n\n\"No need for us of fooling anybody. I stayed there with Mr. Yoshikawa,\nand whether any geisha had gone there early in the evening or not,\nthat's none of my business.\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" Porcupine wallopped him one. Red Shirt tottered.\n\n\"This is outrageous! It is rough to resort to force before deciding the\nright or wrong of it!\"\n\n\"Outrageous indeed!\" Another clout. \"Nothing but wallopping will be\neffective on you scheming guys.\" The remark was followed by a shower\nof blows. I soaked Clown at the same time, and made him think he saw\nthe way to the Kingdom-Come. Finally the two crawled and crouched at\nthe foot of a cedar tree, and either from inability to move or to\nsee, because their eyes had become hazy, they did not even attempt to\nbreak away.\n\n\"Want more? If so, here goes some more!\" With that we gave him more\nuntil he cried enough. \"Want more? You?\" we turned to Clown, and he\nanswered \"Enough, of course.\"\n\n\"This is the punishment of heaven on you grovelling wretches. Keep\nthis in your head and be more careful hereafter. You can never talk\ndown justice.\"\n\nThe two said nothing. They were so thoroughly cowed that they could\nnot speak.\n\n\"I'm going to neither, run away nor hide. You'll find me at Minato-ya on\nthe beach up to five this evening. Bring police officers or any old\nthing you want,\" said Porcupine.\n\n\"I'm not going to run away or hide either. Will wait for you at the same\nplace with Hotta. Take the case to the police station if you like, or do\nas you damn please,\" I said, and we two walked our own way.\n\nIt was a little before seven when I returned to my room. I started\npacking as soon as I was in the room, and the astonished old lady asked\nme what I was trying to do. I'm going to Tokyo to fetch my Madam, I\nsaid, and paid my bill. I boarded a train and came to Minato-ya on the\nbeach and found Porcupine asleep upstairs. I thought of writing my\nresignation, but not knowing how, just scribbled off that \"because of\npersonal affairs, I have to resign and return, to Tokyo. Yours truly,\"\nand addressed and mailed it to the principal.\n\nThe steamer leaves the harbor at six in the evening. Porcupine and I,\ntired out, slept like logs, and when we awoke it was two o'clock. We\nasked the maid if the police had called on us, and she said no. Red\nShirt and Clown had not taken it to the police, eh? We laughed.\n\nThat night I and Porcupine left the town. The farther the vessel steamed\naway from the shore, the more refreshed we felt. From Kobe to Tokyo we\nboarded a through train and when we made Shimbashi, we breathed as if we\nwere once more in congenial human society. I parted from Porcupine at\nthe station, and have not had the chance of meeting him since.\n\nI forgot to tell you about Kiyo. On my arrival at Tokyo, I rushed into\nher house swinging my valise, before going to a hotel, with \"Hello,\nKiyo, I'm back!\"\n\n\"How good of you to return so soon!\" she cried and hot tears streamed\ndown her cheeks. I was overjoyed, and declared that I would not go to\nthe country any more but would start housekeeping with Kiyo in Tokyo.\n\nSome time afterward, some one helped me to a job as assistant engineer\nat the tram car office. The salary was 25 yen a month, and the house\nrent six. Although the house had not a magnificent front entrance, Kiyo\nseemed quite satisfied, but, I am sorry to say, she was a victim of\npneumonia and died in February this year. On the day preceding her\ndeath, she asked me to bedside, and said, \"Please, Master Darling, if\nKiyo is dead, bury me in the temple yard of Master Darling. I will be\nglad to wait in the grave for my Master Darling.\"\n\nSo Kiyo's grave is in the Yogen temple at Kobinata.\n\n--(THE END)--\n\n[A: Insitent]\n[B: queershaped]\n[C: The original just had the Japanese character, Unicode U+5927, sans\n    description]\n[D: aweinspiring]\n[E: about about]\n[F: atomosphere]\n[G: Helloo]\n[H: you go]\n[I: goo-goo eyes]\n[J: proper hyphenation unknown]\n[K: pin-princking]\n[L: Procupine]\n[M: celabration]\n[N: wans't]\n[O: paper.]\n[P: girl shead]\n[Q: stumblieg]\n[R: Rad]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Botchan (Master Darling), by Kin-nosuke Natsume\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BOTCHAN (MASTER DARLING) ***\n\n***** This file should be named 8868.txt or 8868.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/8\/8\/6\/8868\/\n\nProduced by David Starner and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":904,"split":"train"}
