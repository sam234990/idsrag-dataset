{"ori_id":"7d02c2427d7af9d0e8ce6267d38a6613987c2a2a","title":"The Mechanic (1972 film)","context":"The Mechanic (1972 film)\n Arthur Bishop (Charles Bronson) is a \"mechanic\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094a top hit man (assassin). He works exclusively for a secret international organization, which has very strict rules. Bishop is very sophisticated, as he regularly listens to classical music, has an art collection, and is a connoisseur of fine wines. However, he is forced to live alone - he cannot show emotions or trust people. Bishop is under constant emotional pressure, so much so that he is prescribed medication for depression, and one day he is temporarily hospitalized when he loses consciousness as a result of the stress. Bishop pays a call girl (Jill Ireland) for an ongoing girlfriend experience to have a simulated romantic (social and sexual) relationship, including her writing him fake love letters.\nWhen Bishop is assigned one of the organization's heads, \"Big Harry\" McKenna (Keenan Wynn), he shoots at Big Harry, while making him think that the shots are being fired by a hidden sniper. Harry, who Bishop knows has a weak heart, runs up a steep incline, which triggers a heart attack. Bishop then finishes Harry off by smothering him.\nAt Big Harry's funeral, Bishop meets Harry's narcissistic, ruthless and ambitious son Steve (Jan-Michael Vincent). Steve is intrigued by Bishop and seeks to find out more about him. Bishop is also intrigued, as he realizes that Steve has a personality suited for being a hit man, and plays along. As part of his training, Bishop teaches Steve that \"every person has a weakness, and that once this weakness is found, the target is easy to kill.\" But Bishop failed to get his superiors' prior consent for the arrangement. Following a messy assassination conducted by Bishop and Steve, the organization warns Bishop that his irresponsible choice to involve Steve has been interpreted as selfish behavior.\nThe organization then gives Bishop an urgent mission, this time in Italy. Once again, Bishop involves Steve in the new plan, but just before they leave Bishop happens to find among Steve's belongings a file containing a lot of information about Bishop. This file is very similar to the files Bishop prepared for his targets. Nevertheless, Bishop allows Steve to go with him to Italy.\nIn Italy, Bishop and Steve approach a boat where their intended victim is supposed to be, but it becomes apparent that this was a trap and they are the real targets. Bishop and Steve are ambushed, but they manage to kill all their would-be assassins.\nHis apprenticeship apparently complete, Steve shares a celebratory bottle of wine with Bishop, having coated the latter's glass with brucine, a colorless and deadly alkaloid. When Bishop realizes that he has been poisoned, he asks Steve if it was because Bishop had killed Steve's father. Steve responds that he had not realized his father was murdered. Steve taunts Bishop, saying \"you told me that everyone has a jelly spot--yours was that you couldn't cut it alone.\" Steve goes on to reveal that he was not acting on orders to kill Bishop.\nSteve returns to Bishop's home to pick up the Ford Mustang he had left there. He finds a note affixed to the rear-view mirror, which reads: \"Steve, if you're read this it means I didn't make it back. It also means you've broken a filament controlling a 13-second delay trigger. End of game. Bang! You're dead.\" As Steve frantically reaches for the door handle, the car explodes.\n<html>\n<head><title>Mechanic, The Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Mechanic, The script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Mechanic, The script, Mechanic, The movie script, Mechanic, The film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

LAWYER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\n<\/b>\n          A private office. Desk, computer, a handwritten note reads\n          \"Leave mail here, will be back Wednesday.\" A box from UPS\n          which Bishop TEARS open. Inside, what looks like a large\n          WEAPON. Steve goes to the windows, pushes them open.\n          P.O.V. - THE EMBASSY ACROSS: Changing its security pattern.\n          Men are leaving posts on exterior patios, locking doors.\n          Below, the excess manpower is channeled to the front.\n          Bishop turns, FIRES OUT THE WINDOW. A Cable streaks across,\n          SINKS into the wall of the embassy 30 feet away. Bishop\n          HOOKS the cable on this side, tosses the gun in the box.\n          Steve seals it with tape, slaps a return label on it.\n          He crosses the hall, tosses it in the MAIL ROOM. When he\n          returns, Bishop's already secured the cable outside.\n\n<b>                         BISHOP\n<\/b>          Ready?\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n<b>          71.\n<\/b>          Steve hooks on as well, they're both wearing harnesses under\n          their clothing.

No way back now,\n          and no trace left behind.\n          Jackets strip, reverse to the pattern of the embassy\n          Security. A quick lock pick, and they slip inside.\n\n<b>          INT. ROOF LEVEL, EMBASSY - NIGHT\n<\/b>\n          Elevator doors open and the Mark gets out.

Pairs of guards make their rounds.\n          CLOSING IN ON ONE PAIR. Something about them... The guard\n          squints just as the image CHANGES, showing another part of\n          the embassy.

Looks out.\n          HIS P.O.V.: The rooftop, lit by security lights, the\n          strobing of the firetrucks below. Dark shadows. He hears a\n          RUSTLING, a BANGING.

Screaming, bubbles FLOWING from her\n          mouth!\n          ABOVE THE SURFACE. It's silent. No sign of the violent\n          struggle going on below the surface.\n          ACROSS THE ROOM. Guard number one returns, glances up\n          towards the pool. Doesn't hear anything. He sits back in\n          his chair.\n          UNDERWATER. The struggle is violent, silent, terrible in\n          it's inevitable conclusion. The Mark writhes and jerks but\n          Bishop holds her tight, always pulling her away from the\n          surface. Finally, the fight goes out of her. She goes limp\n          in his arms.\n          He turns her, stares into her unseeing eyes. Then lets her\n          go, rising slowly to the surface.\n          AT THE SURFACE. Bishop just breaks, breathing in, silent.\n          He raises himself slightly, sees the guard at his post.\n          ACROSS THE ROOM.

Bishop's eyes settle on a video\n          image: He and the woman, caught just an hour ago in the\n          middle of the dancing party.
