{"ori_id":"b3a3aa9733be6502e3df5dcd1658f2d436635fa9","title":"The Wife of Sir Isaac Harman","context":"The Wife of Sir Isaac Harman\n The protagonist of The Wife of Sir Isaac Harman is Lady Harman, n\u0102\u0160e Ellen Sawbridge. The moral, emotional, and intellectual conflicts that this tall, sensitive, graceful woman confronts arise in the context of a loveless marriage with Sir Isaac Harman, a self-made man who has grown rich as the proprietor of International Bread and Cake Stores and Staminal Bread. Sir Isaac meets his future wife when she is only seventeen and still a student in a boardinghouse in Wimbledon; she marries him largely out of pity. But the marriage is not a happy one, despite great wealth and the birth of four children. Sir Isaac is inherently domineering, and in an age of Suffragettes he encounters a desire for greater freedom in his wife.\nThe plot of the novel turns on Lady Harman's relationship with George Brumley (invariably \"Mr. Brumley\" in the text), a successful genteel novelist whose wife has died three and a half years earlier. Lady Harman meets Mr. Brumley because the Harmans buy his house, Black Strand, in the countryside outside London. Mr. Brumley falls in love with Lady Harman at first sight. His interest in her leads him and a number of acquaintances to pay Lady Harman a visit. This results is invitations to luncheons and committees for Lady Harman, and despite all his efforts the possessive Sir Isaac is unable to quell his wife's desire to accept. Through many twists and turns Mr. Brumley's attachment to Lady Harman increases until, after the death of Sir Isaac, he appears to win her love on the novel's conlcuding page. (This comes after she has definitively refused to marry him, and the reader is left uncertain whether her passionate kiss signifies that she has changed her mind on this question.)\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Wife of Sir Isaac Harman, by H.

The chauffeur indicated by a movement of\nthe head that this at last was it. A tall young woman with a big soft\nmouth, great masses of blue-black hair on either side of a broad, low\nforehead, and eyes of so dark a brown you might have thought them black,\ndrooped forward and surveyed the house with a mixture of keen\nappreciation and that gentle apprehension which is the shadow of desire\nin unassuming natures....\n\nThe little house with the white-framed windows looked at her with a\nsleepy wakefulness from under its blinds, and made no sign. Beyond the\ncorner was a glimpse of lawn, a rank of delphiniums, and the sound of a\nwheel-barrow.\n\n\"Clarence!\" the lady called again.\n\nClarence, with an air of exceeding his duties, decided to hear,\ndescended slowly, and came to the door.\n\n\"Very likely--if you were to look for a bell, Clarence....\"\n\nClarence regarded the porch with a hostile air, made no secret that he\nthought it a fool of a porch, seemed on the point of disobedience, and\nsubmitted. His gestures suggested a belief that he would next be asked\nto boil eggs or do the boots. He found a bell and rang it with the\nneedless violence of a man who has no special knowledge of ringing\nbells. How was _he_ to know? he was a chauffeur. The bell did not so\nmuch ring as explode and swamp the place. Sounds of ringing came from\nall the windows, and even out of the chimneys. It seemed as if once set\nringing that bell would never cease....\n\nClarence went to the bonnet of his machine, and presented his stooping\nback in a defensive manner against anyone who might come out. He wasn't\na footman, anyhow. He'd rung that bell all right, and now he must see to\nhis engine.\n\n\"He's rung so _loud!_\" said the lady weakly--apparently to God.\n\nThe door behind the neat white pillars opened, and a little red-nosed\nwoman, in a cap she had evidently put on without a proper glass,\nappeared. She surveyed the car and its occupant with disfavour over her\nalso very oblique spectacles.\n\nThe lady waved a pink paper to her, a house-agent's order to view. \"Is\nthis Black Strands?\" she shouted.\n\nThe little woman advanced slowly with her eyes fixed malevolently on the\npink paper. She seemed to be stalking it.\n\n\"This is Black Strands?\" repeated the tall lady. \"I should be so sorry\nif I disturbed you--if it isn't; ringing the bell like that--and all.\nYou can't think----\"\n\n\"This is Black _Strand_,\" said the little old woman with a note of deep\nreproach, and suddenly ceased to look over her glasses and looked\nthrough them. She looked no kindlier through them, and her eye seemed\nmuch larger. She was now regarding the lady in the car, though with a\nsustained alertness towards the pink paper. \"I suppose,\" she said,\n\"you've come to see over the place?\"\n\n\"If it doesn't disturb anyone; if it is quite convenient----\"\n\n\"Mr. Brumley is _hout_,\" said the little old woman. \"And if you got an\norder to view, you got an order to view.\"\n\n\"If you think I might.\"\n\nThe lady stood up in the car, a tall and graceful figure of doubt and\ndesire and glossy black fur. \"I'm sure it looks a very charming house.\"\n\n\"It's _clean_,\" said the little old woman, \"from top to toe. Look as you\nmay.\"\n\n\"I'm sure it is,\" said the tall lady, and put aside her great fur coat\nfrom her lithe, slender, red-clad body. (She was permitted by a sudden\ncivility of Clarence's to descend.) \"Why! the windows,\" she said,\npausing on the step, \"are like crystal.\"\n\n\"These very 'ands,\" said the little old woman, and glanced up at the\nwindows the lady had praised. The little old woman's initial sternness\nwrinkled and softened as the skin of a windfall does after a day or so\nupon the ground. She half turned in the doorway and made a sudden\nvergerlike gesture. \"We enter,\" she said, \"by the 'all.... Them's Mr.\nBrumley's 'ats and sticks. Every 'at or cap 'as a stick, and every stick\n'as a 'at _or_ cap, and on the 'all table is the gloves corresponding.\nOn the right is the door leading to the kitching, on the left is the\nlarge droring-room which Mr. Brumley 'as took as 'is study.\" Her voice\nfell to lowlier things. \"The other door beyond is a small lavatory\n'aving a basing for washing 'ands.\"\n\n\"It's a perfectly delightful hall,\" said the lady. \"So low and\nwide-looking. And everything so bright--and lovely. Those long, Italian\npictures! And how charming that broad outlook upon the garden beyond!\"\n\n\"You'll think it charminger when you see the garding,\" said the little\nold woman. \"It was Mrs. Brumley's especial delight. Much of it--with 'er\nown 'ands.\"\n\n\"We now enter the droring-room,\" she proceeded, and flinging open the\ndoor to the right was received with an indistinct cry suggestive of the\nwords, \"Oh, _damn_ it!\" The stout medium-sized gentleman in an artistic\ngreen-grey Norfolk suit, from whom the cry proceeded, was kneeling on\nthe floor close to the wide-open window, and he was engaged in lacing up\na boot. He had a round, ruddy, rather handsome, amiable face with a sort\nof bang of brown hair coming over one temple, and a large silk bow under\nhis chin and a little towards one ear, such as artists and artistic men\nof letters affect. His profile was regular and fine, his eyes\nexpressive, his mouth, a very passable mouth. His features expressed at\nfirst only the na\u00c3\u00afve horror of a shy man unveiled.\n\nIntelligent appreciation supervened.\n\nThere was a crowded moment of rapid mutual inspection. The lady's\nattitude was that of the enthusiastic house-explorer arrested in full\nflight, falling swiftly towards apology and retreat. (It was a\nfrightfully attractive room, too, full of the brightest colour, and with\na big white cast of a statue--a Venus!--in the window.) She backed over\nthe threshold again.\n\n\"I thought you was out by that window, sir,\" said the little old woman\nintimately, and was nearly shutting the door between them and all the\nbeginnings of this story.\n\nBut the voice of the gentleman arrested and wedged open the closing\ndoor.\n\n\"I----Are you looking at the house?\" he said. \"I say! Just a moment,\nMrs. Rabbit.\"\n\nHe came down the length of the room with a slight flicking noise due to\nthe scandalized excitement of his abandoned laces. The lady was reminded\nof her not so very distant schooldays, when it would have been\nconsidered a suitable answer to such a question as his to reply, \"No, I\nam walking down Piccadilly on my hands.\" But instead she waved that pink\npaper again. \"The agents,\" she said. \"Recommended--specially. So sorry\nif I intrude. I ought, I know, to have written first; but I came on an\nimpulse.\"\n\nBy this time the gentleman in the artistic tie, who had also the\nartistic eye for such matters, had discovered that the lady was young,\ndelightfully slender, either pretty or beautiful, he could scarcely tell\nwhich, and very, very well dressed. \"I am glad,\" he said, with\nremarkable decision, \"that I was not out. _I_ will show you the house.\"\n\n\"'Ow _can_ you, sir?\" intervened the little old woman.\n\n\"Oh! show a house! Why not?\"\n\n\"The kitchings--you don't understand the range, sir--it's beyond you.\nAnd upstairs. You can't show a lady upstairs.\"\n\nThe gentleman reflected upon these difficulties.\n\n\"Well, I'm going to show her all I can show her anyhow. And after that,\nMrs. Rabbit, you shall come in. You needn't wait.\"\n\n\"I'm thinking,\" said Mrs. Rabbit, folding stiff little arms and\nregarding him sternly. \"You won't be much good after tea, you know, if\nyou don't get your afternoon's exercise.\"\n\n\"Rendez-vous in the kitchen, Mrs. Rabbit,\" said Mr. Brumley, firmly, and\nMrs. Rabbit after a moment of mute struggle disappeared discontentedly.\n\n\"I do not want to be the least bit a bother,\" said the lady. \"I'm\nintruding, I know, without the least bit of notice. I _do_ hope I'm not\ndisturbing you----\" she seemed to make an effort to stop at that, and\nfailed and added--\"the least bit. Do please tell me if I am.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Mr. Brumley. \"I hate my afternoon's walk as a\nprisoner hates the treadmill.\"\n\n\"She's such a nice old creature.\"\n\n\"She's been a mother--and several aunts--to us ever since my wife died.\nShe was the first servant we ever had.\"\n\n\"All this house,\" he explained to his visitor's questioning eyes, \"was\nmy wife's creation. It was a little featureless agent's house on the\nedge of these pine-woods. She saw something in the shape of the\nrooms--and that central hall. We've enlarged it of course. Twice. This\nwas two rooms, that is why there is a step down in the centre.\"\n\n\"That window and window-seat----\"\n\n\"That was her addition,\" said Mr. Brumley. \"All this room\nis--replete--with her personality.\" He hesitated, and explained further.\n\"When we prepared this house--we expected to be better off--than we\nsubsequently became--and she could let herself go. Much is from Holland\nand Italy.\"\n\n\"And that beautiful old writing-desk with the little single rose in a\nglass!\"\n\n\"She put it there. She even in a sense put the flower there. It is\nrenewed of course. By Mrs. Rabbit. She trained Mrs. Rabbit.\"\n\nHe sighed slightly, apparently at some thought of Mrs. Rabbit.\n\n\"You--you write----\" the lady stopped, and then diverted a question that\nshe perhaps considered too blunt, \"there?\"\n\n\"Largely. I am--a sort of author. Perhaps you know my books. Not very\nimportant books--but people sometimes read them.\"\n\nThe rose-pink of the lady's cheek deepened by a shade. Within her pretty\nhead, her mind rushed to and fro saying \"Brumley? Brumley?\" Then she had\na saving gleam. \"Are you _George_ Brumley?\" she asked,--\"_the_ George\nBrumley?\"\n\n\"My name _is_ George Brumley,\" he said, with a proud modesty. \"Perhaps\nyou know my little Euphemia books? They are still the most read.\"\n\nThe lady made a faint, dishonest assent-like noise; and her rose-pink\ndeepened another shade. But her interlocutor was not watching her very\nclosely just then.\n\n\"Euphemia was my wife,\" he said, \"at least, my wife gave her to me--a\nkind of exhalation. _This_\"--his voice fell with a genuine respect for\nliterary associations--\"was Euphemia's home.\"\n\n\"I still,\" he continued, \"go on. I go on writing about Euphemia. I have\nto. In this house. With my tradition.... But it is becoming\npainful--painful. Curiously more painful now than at the beginning. And\nI want to go. I want at last to make a break. That is why I am letting\nor selling the house.... There will be no more Euphemia.\"\n\nHis voice fell to silence.\n\nThe lady surveyed the long low clear room so cleverly prepared for life,\nwith its white wall, its Dutch clock, its Dutch dresser, its pretty\nseats about the open fireplace, its cleverly placed bureau, its\nsun-trap at the garden end; she could feel the rich intention of living\nin its every arrangement and a sense of uncertainty in things struck\nhome to her. She seemed to see a woman, a woman like herself--only very,\nvery much cleverer--flitting about the room and making it. And then this\nwoman had vanished--nowhither. Leaving this gentleman--sadly left--in\nthe care of Mrs. Rabbit.\n\n\"And she is dead?\" she said with a softness in her dark eyes and a fall\nin her voice that was quite natural and very pretty.\n\n\"She died,\" said Mr. Brumley, \"three years and a half ago.\" He\nreflected. \"Almost exactly.\"\n\nHe paused and she filled the pause with feeling.\n\nHe became suddenly very brave and brisk and businesslike. He led the way\nback into the hall and made explanations. \"It is not so much a hall as a\nhall living-room. We use that end, except when we go out upon the\nverandah beyond, as our dining-room. The door to the right is the\nkitchen.\"\n\nThe lady's attention was caught again by the bright long eventful\npictures that had already pleased her. \"They are copies of two of\nCarpaccio's St. George series in Venice,\" he said. \"We bought them\ntogether there. But no doubt you've seen the originals. In a little old\nplace with a custodian and rather dark. One of those corners--so full of\nthat delightful out-of-the-wayishness which is so characteristic, I\nthink, of Venice. I don't know if you found that in Venice?\"\n\n\"I've never been abroad,\" said the lady. \"Never. I should love to go. I\nsuppose you and your wife went--ever so much.\"\n\nHe had a transitory wonder that so fine a lady should be untravelled,\nbut his eagerness to display his backgrounds prevented him thinking that\nout at the time. \"Two or three times,\" he said, \"before our little boy\ncame to us. And always returning with something for this place. Look!\"\nhe went on, stepped across an exquisite little brick court to a lawn of\nsoft emerald and turning back upon the house. \"That Dellia Robbia\nplacque we lugged all the way back from Florence with us, and that stone\nbird-bath is from Siena.\"\n\n\"How bright it is!\" murmured the lady after a brief still appreciation.\n\"Delightfully bright. As though it would shine even if the sun didn't.\"\nAnd she abandoned herself to the rapture of seeing a house and garden\nthat were for once better even than the agent's superlatives. And within\nher grasp if she chose--within her grasp.\n\nShe made the garden melodious with soft appreciative sounds. She had a\nsmall voice for her size but quite a charming one, a little live bird of\na voice, bright and sweet. It was a clear unruffled afternoon; even the\nunseen wheel-barrow had very sensibly ceased to creak and seemed to be\nsomewhere listening....\n\nOnly one trivial matter marred their easy explorations;--his boots\nremained unlaced. No propitious moment came when he could stoop and lace\nthem. He was not a dexterous man with eyelets, and stooping made him\ngrunt and his head swim. He hoped these trailing imperfections went\nunmarked. He tried subtly to lead this charming lady about and at the\nsame time walk a little behind her. She on her part could not determine\nwhether he would be displeased or not if she noticed this slight\nembarrassment and asked him to set it right. They were quite long\nleather laces and they flew about with a sturdy negligence of anything\nbut their own offensive contentment, like a gross man who whistles a\nvulgar tune as he goes round some ancient church; flick, flock, they\nwent, and flip, flap, enjoying themselves, and sometimes he trod on one\nand halted in his steps, and sometimes for a moment she felt her foot\ntether him. But man is the adaptable animal and presently they both\nbecame more used to these inconveniences and more mechanical in their\nefforts to avoid them. They treated those laces then exactly as nice\npeople would treat that gross man; a minimum of polite attention and all\nthe rest pointedly directed away from him....\n\nThe garden was full of things that people dream about doing in their\ngardens and mostly never do. There was a rose garden all blooming in\nchorus, and with pillar-roses and arches that were not so much growths\nas overflowing cornucopias of roses, and a neat orchard with shapely\ntrees white-painted to their exact middles, a stone wall bearing\nclematis and a clothes-line so gay with Mr. Brumley's blue and white\nflannel shirts that it seemed an essential part of the design. And then\nthere was a great border of herbaceous perennials backed by delphiniums\nand monkshood already in flower and budding hollyhocks rising to their\nduty; a border that reared its blaze of colour against a hill-slope dark\nwith pines. There was no hedge whatever to this delightful garden. It\nseemed to go straight into the pine-woods; only an invisible netting\nmarked its limits and fended off the industrious curiosity of the\nrabbits.\n\n\"This strip of wood is ours right up to the crest,\" he said, \"and from\nthe crest one has a view. One has two views. If you would care----?\"\n\nThe lady made it clear that she was there to see all she could. She\nradiated her appetite to see. He carried a fur stole for her over his\narm and flicked the way up the hill. Flip, flap, flop. She followed\ndemurely.\n\n\"This is the only view I care to show you now,\" he said at the crest.\n\"There was a better one beyond there. But--it has been defiled.... Those\nhills! I knew you would like them. The space of it! And ... yet----.\nThis view--lacks the shining ponds. There are wonderful distant ponds.\nAfter all I must show you the other! But you see there is the high-road,\nand the high-road has produced an abomination. Along here we go. Now.\nDon't look down please.\" His gesture covered the foreground. \"Look right\nover the nearer things into the distance. There!\"\n\nThe lady regarded the wide view with serene appreciation. \"I don't see,\"\nshe said, \"that it's in any way ruined. It's perfect.\"\n\n\"You don't see! Ah! you look right over. You look high. I wish I could\ntoo. But that screaming board! I wish the man's crusts would choke\nhim.\"\n\nAnd indeed quite close at hand, where the road curved about below them,\nthe statement that Staminal Bread, the True Staff of Life, was sold only\nby the International Bread Shops, was flung out with a vigour of yellow\nand Prussian blue that made the landscape tame.\n\nHis finger directed her questioning eye.\n\n\"_Oh!_\" said the lady suddenly, as one who is convicted of a stupidity\nand coloured slightly.\n\n\"In the morning of course it is worse. The sun comes directly on to it.\nThen really and truly it blots out everything.\"\n\nThe lady stood quite silent for a little time, with her eyes on the\ndistant ponds. Then he perceived that she was blushing. She turned to\nher interlocutor as a puzzled pupil might turn to a teacher.\n\n\"It really is very good bread,\" she said. \"They make it----Oh! most\ncarefully. With the germ in. And one has to tell people.\"\n\nHer point of view surprised him. He had expected nothing but a docile\nsympathy. \"But to tell people _here_!\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, I suppose one oughtn't to tell them here.\"\n\n\"Man does not live by bread alone.\"\n\nShe gave the faintest assent.\n\n\"This is the work of one pushful, shoving creature, a man named Harman.\nImagine him! Imagine what he must be! Don't you feel his soul defiling\nus?--this summit of a stupendous pile of--dough, thinking of nothing\nbut his miserable monstrous profits, seeing nothing in the delight of\nlife, the beauty of the world but something that attracts attention,\ndraws eyes, something that gives him his horrible opportunity of getting\nahead of all his poor little competitors and inserting--_this!_ It's the\nquintessence of all that is wrong with the world;--squalid, shameless\nhuckstering!\" He flew off at a tangent. \"Four or five years ago they\nmade this landscape disease,--a knight!\"\n\nHe looked at her for a sympathetic indignation, and then suddenly\nsomething snapped in his brain and he understood. There wasn't an\ninstant between absolute innocence and absolute knowledge.\n\n\"You see,\" she said as responsive as though he had cried out sharply at\nthe horror in his mind, \"Sir Isaac is my husband. Naturally ... I ought\nto have given you my name to begin with. It was silly....\"\n\nMr. Brumley gave one wild glance at the board, but indeed there was not\na word to be said in its mitigation. It was the crude advertisement of a\ncrude pretentious thing crudely sold. \"My dear lady!\" he said in his\nlargest style, \"I am desolated! But I have said it! It isn't a pretty\nboard.\"\n\nA memory of epithets pricked him. \"You must forgive--a certain touch\nof--rhetoric.\"\n\nHe turned about as if to dismiss the board altogether, but she remained\nwith her brows very faintly knit, surveying the cause of his offence.\n\n\"It isn't a _pretty_ board,\" she said. \"I've wondered at times.... It\nisn't.\"\n\n\"I implore you to forget that outbreak--mere petulance--because, I\nsuppose, of a peculiar liking for that particular view. There\nare--associations----\"\n\n\"I've wondered lately,\" she continued, holding on to her own thoughts,\n\"what people _did_ think of them. And it's curious--to hear----\"\n\nFor a moment neither spoke, she surveyed the board and he the tall ease\nof her pose. And he was thinking she must surely be the most beautiful\nwoman he had ever encountered. The whole country might be covered with\nboards if it gave us such women as this. He felt the urgent need of some\nphrase, to pull the situation out of this pit into which it had fallen.\nHe was a little unready, his faculties all as it were neglecting his\nneeds and crowding to the windows to stare, and meanwhile she spoke\nagain, with something of the frankness of one who thinks aloud.\n\n\"You see,\" she said, \"one _doesn't_ hear. One thinks perhaps----And\nthere it is. When one marries very young one is apt to take so much for\ngranted. And afterwards----\"\n\nShe was wonderfully expressive in her inexpressiveness, he thought, but\nfound as yet no saving phrase. Her thought continued to drop from her.\n\"One sees them so much that at last one doesn't see them.\"\n\nShe turned away to survey the little house again; it was visible in\nbright strips between the red-scarred pine stems. She looked at it chin\nup, with a still approval--but she was the slenderest loveliness, and\nwith such a dignity!--and she spoke at length as though the board had\nnever existed. \"It's like a little piece of another world; so bright and\nso--perfect.\"\n\nThere was the phantom of a sigh in her voice.\n\n\"I think you'll be charmed by our rockery,\" he said. \"It was one of our\nparticular efforts. Every time we two went abroad we came back with\nsomething, stonecrop or Alpine or some little bulb from the wayside.\"\n\n\"How can you leave it!\"\n\nHe was leaving it because it bored him to death. But so intricate is the\nhuman mind that it was with perfect sincerity he answered: \"It will be a\ntremendous wrench.... I have to go.\"\n\n\"And you've written most of your books here and lived here!\"\n\nThe note of sympathy in her voice gave him a sudden suspicion that she\nimagined his departure due to poverty. Now to be poor as an author is to\nbe unpopular, and he valued his popularity--with the better sort of\npeople. He hastened to explain. \"I have to go, because here, you see,\nhere, neither for me nor my little son, is it Life. It's a place of\nmemories, a place of accomplished beauty. My son already breaks away,--a\npreparatory school at Margate. Healthier, better, for us to break\naltogether I feel, wrench though it may. It's full for us at least--a\nnew tenant would be different of course--but for _us_ it's full of\nassociations we can't alter, can't for the life of us change. Nothing\nyou see goes on. And life you know _is_ change--change and going on.\"\n\nHe paused impressively on his generalization.\n\n\"But you will want----You will want to hand it over to--to sympathetic\npeople of course. People,\" she faltered, \"who will understand.\"\n\nMr. Brumley took an immense stride--conversationally. \"I am certain\nthere is no one I would more readily see in that house than yourself,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"But----\" she protested. \"And besides, you don't know me!\"\n\n\"One knows some things at once, and I am as sure you\nwould--understand--as if I had known you twenty years. It may seem\nabsurd to you, but when I looked up just now and saw you for the first\ntime, I thought--this, this is the tenant. This is her house.... Not a\ndoubt. That is why I did not go for my walk--came round with you.\"\n\n\"You really think you would like us to have that house?\" she said.\n\"_Still?_\"\n\n\"No one better,\" said Mr. Brumley.\n\n\"After the board?\"\n\n\"After a hundred boards, I let the house to you....\"\n\n\"My husband of course will be the tenant,\" reflected Lady Harman.\n\nShe seemed to brighten again by an effort: \"I have always wanted\nsomething like this, that wasn't gorgeous, that wasn't mean. I can't\n_make_ things. It isn't every one--can _make_ a place....\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a72\n\nMr. Brumley found their subsequent conversation the fullest realization\nof his extremest hopes. Behind his amiable speeches, which soon grew\naltogether easy and confident again, a hundred imps of vanity were\npatting his back for the intuition, the swift decision that had\nabandoned his walk so promptly. In some extraordinary way the incident\nof the board became impossible; it hadn't happened, he felt, or it had\nhappened differently. Anyhow there was no time to think that over now.\nHe guided the lady to the two little greenhouses, made her note the\nopening glow of the great autumnal border and brought her to the rock\ngarden. She stooped and loved and almost kissed the soft healthy\ncushions of pampered saxifrage: she appreciated the cleverness of the\nmoss-bed--where there were droseras; she knelt to the gentians; she had\na kindly word for that bank-holiday corner where London Pride still\nbelatedly rejoiced; she cried out at the delicate Iceland poppies that\nthrust up between the stones of the rough pavement; and so in the most\namiable accord they came to the raised seat in the heart of it all, and\nsat down and took in the whole effect of the place, and backing of\nwoods, the lush borders, the neat lawn, the still neater orchard, the\npergola, the nearer delicacies among the stones, and the gable, the\nshining white rough-cast of the walls, the casement windows, the\nprojecting upper story, the carefully sought-out old tiles of the roof.\nAnd everything bathed in that caressing sunshine which does not scorch\nnor burn but gilds and warms deliciously, that summer sunshine which\nonly northward islands know.\n\nRecovering from his first astonishment and his first misadventure, Mr.\nBrumley was soon himself again, talkative, interesting, subtly and\ngently aggressive. For once one may use a hackneyed phrase without the\nslightest exaggeration; he was charmed...\n\nHe was one of those very natural-minded men with active imaginations who\nfind women the most interesting things in a full and interesting\nuniverse. He was an entirely good man and almost professionally on the\nside of goodness, his pen was a pillar of the home and he was hostile\nand even actively hostile to all those influences that would undermine\nand change--anything; but he did find women attractive. He watched them\nand thought about them, he loved to be with them, he would take great\npains to please and interest them, and his mind was frequently dreaming\nquite actively of them, of championing them, saying wonderful and\nimpressive things to them, having great friendships with them, adoring\nthem and being adored by them. At times he had to ride this interest on\nthe curb. At times the vigour of its urgencies made him inconsistent and\nsecretive.... Comparatively his own sex was a matter of indifference to\nhim. Indeed he was a very normal man. Even such abstractions as Goodness\nand Justice had rich feminine figures in his mind, and when he sat down\nto write criticism at his desk, that pretty little slut of a Delphic\nSibyl presided over his activities.\n\nSo that it was a cultivated as well as an attentive eye that studied the\nmovements of Lady Harman and an experienced ear that weighed the words\nand cadences of her entirely inadequate and extremely expressive share\nin their conversation. He had enjoyed the social advantages of a popular\nand presentable man of letters, and he had met a variety of ladies; but\nhe had never yet met anyone at all like Lady Harman. She was pretty and\nquite young and fresh; he doubted if she was as much as four-and-twenty;\nshe was as simple-mannered as though she was ever so much younger than\nthat, and dignified as though she was ever so much older; and she had a\nsort of lustre of wealth about her----. One met it sometimes in young\nrichly married Jewesses, but though she was very dark she wasn't at all\nof that type; he was inclined to think she must be Welsh. This manifest\nspending of great lots of money on the richest, finest and fluffiest\nthings was the only aspect of her that sustained the parvenu idea; and\nit wasn't in any way carried out by her manners, which were as modest\nand silent and inaggressive as the very best can be. Personally he liked\nopulence, he responded to countless-guinea furs....\n\nSoon there was a neat little history in his mind that was reasonably\nnear the truth, of a hard-up professional family, fatherless perhaps, of\na mercenary marriage at seventeen or so--and this....\n\nAnd while Mr. Brumley's observant and speculative faculties were thus\nactive, his voice was busily engaged. With the accumulated artistry of\nyears he was developing his pose. He did it almost subconsciously. He\nflung out hint and impulsive confidence and casual statement with the\ncareless assurance of the accustomed performer, until by nearly\nimperceptible degrees that finished picture of the two young lovers,\nhappy, artistic, a little Bohemian and one of them doomed to die, making\ntheir home together in an atmosphere of sunny gaiety, came into being in\nher mind....\n\n\"It must have been beautiful to have begun life like that,\" she said in\na voice that was a sigh, and it flashed joyfully across Mr. Brumley's\nmind that this wonderful person could envy his Euphemia.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"at least we had our Spring.\"\n\n\"To be together,\" said the lady, \"and--so beautifully poor....\"\n\nThere is a phase in every relationship when one must generalize if one\nis to go further. A certain practice in this kind of talk with ladies\nblunted the finer sensibilities of Mr. Brumley. At any rate he was able\nto produce this sentence without a qualm. \"Life,\" he said, \"is sometimes\na very extraordinary thing.\"\n\nLady Harman reflected upon this statement and then responded with an air\nof remembered moments: \"Isn't it.\"\n\n\"One loses the most precious things,\" said Mr. Brumley, \"and one loses\nthem and it seems as though one couldn't go on. And one goes on.\"\n\n\"And one finds oneself,\" said Lady Harman, \"without all sorts of\nprecious things----\" And she stopped, transparently realizing that she\nwas saying too much.\n\n\"There is a sort of vitality about life,\" said Mr. Brumley, and stopped\nas if on the verge of profundities.\n\n\"I suppose one hopes,\" said Lady Harman. \"And one doesn't think. And\nthings happen.\"\n\n\"Things happen,\" assented Mr. Brumley.\n\nFor a little while their minds rested upon this thought, as chasing\nbutterflies might rest together on a flower.\n\n\"And so I am going to leave this,\" Mr. Brumley resumed. \"I am going up\nthere to London for a time with my boy. Then perhaps we may\ntravel-Germany, Italy, perhaps-in his holidays. It is beginning again, I\nfeel with him. But then even we two must drift apart. I can't deny him a\npublic school sooner or later. His own road....\"\n\n\"It will be lonely for you,\" sympathized the lady. \"I have my work,\"\nsaid Mr. Brumley with a sort of valiant sadness.\n\n\"Yes, I suppose your work----\"\n\nShe left an eloquent gap.\n\n\"There, of course, one's fortunate,\" said Mr. Brumley.\n\n\"I wish,\" said Lady Harman, with a sudden frankness and a little\nquickening of her colour, \"that I had some work. Something--that was my\nown.\"\n\n\"But you have----There are social duties. There must be all sorts of\nthings.\"\n\n\"There are--all sorts of things. I suppose I'm ungrateful. I have my\nchildren.\"\n\n\"You have children, Lady Harman!\"\n\n\"I've _four_.\"\n\nHe was really astonished, \"Your _own_?\"\n\nShe turned her fawn's eyes on his with a sudden wonder at his meaning.\n\"My own!\" she said with the faintest tinge of astonished laughter in her\nvoice. \"What else could they be?\"\n\n\"I thought----I thought you might have step-children.\"\n\n\"Oh! of course! No! I'm their mother;--all four of them. They're mine as\nfar as that goes. Anyhow.\"\n\nAnd her eye questioned him again for his intentions.\n\nBut his thought ran along its own path. \"You see,\" he said, \"there is\nsomething about you--so freshly beginning life. So like--Spring.\"\n\n\"You thought I was too young! I'm nearly six-and-twenty! But all the\nsame,--though they're mine,--_still_----Why shouldn't a woman have work\nin the world, Mr. Brumley? In spite of all that.\"\n\n\"But surely--that's the most beautiful work in the world that anyone\ncould possibly have.\"\n\nLady Harman reflected. She seemed to hesitate on the verge of some\nanswer and not to say it.\n\n\"You see,\" she said, \"it may have been different with you.... When one\nhas a lot of nurses, and not very much authority.\"\n\nShe coloured deeply and broke back from the impending revelations.\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"I would like some work of my own.\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a73\n\nAt this point their conversation was interrupted by the lady's chauffeur\nin a manner that struck Mr. Brumley as extraordinary, but which the tall\nlady evidently regarded as the most natural thing in the world.\n\nMr. Clarence appeared walking across the lawn towards them, surveying\nthe charms of as obviously a charming garden as one could have, with the\ndisdain and hostility natural to a chauffeur. He did not so much touch\nhis cap as indicate that it was within reach, and that he could if he\npleased touch it. \"It's time you were going, my lady,\" he said. \"Sir\nIsaac will be coming back by the five-twelve, and there'll be a nice\nto-do if you ain't at home and me at the station and everything in order\nagain.\"\n\nManifestly an abnormal expedition.\n\n\"Must we start at once, Clarence?\" asked the lady consulting a bracelet\nwatch. \"You surely won't take two hours----\"\n\n\"I can give you fifteen minutes more, my lady,\" said Clarence, \"provided\nI may let her out and take my corners just exactly in my own way.\"\n\n\"And I must give you tea,\" said Mr. Brumley, rising to his feet. \"And\nthere is the kitchen.\"\n\n\"And upstairs! I'm afraid, Clarence, for this occasion only you\nmust--what is it?--let her out.\"\n\n\"And no 'Oh Clarence!' my lady?\"\n\nShe ignored that.\n\n\"I'll tell Mrs. Rabbit at once,\" said Mr. Brumley, and started to run\nand trod in some complicated way on one of his loose laces and was\nprecipitated down the rockery steps. \"Oh!\" cried the lady. \"Mind!\" and\nclasped her hands.\n\nHe made a sound exactly like the word \"damnation\" as he fell, but he\ndidn't so much get up as bounce up, apparently in the brightest of\ntempers, and laughed, held out two earthy hands for sympathy with a mock\nrueful grimace, and went on, earthy-green at the knees and a little more\ncarefully towards the house. Clarence, having halted to drink deep\nsatisfaction from this disaster, made his way along a nearly parallel\npath towards the kitchen, leaving his lady to follow as she chose to the\nhouse.\n\n\"_You'll_ take a cup of tea?\" called Mr. Brumley.\n\n\"Oh! _I'll_ take a cup all right,\" said Clarence in the kindly voice of\none who addresses an amusing inferior....\n\nMrs. Rabbit had already got the tea-things out upon the cane table in\nthe pretty verandah, and took it ill that she should be supposed not to\nhave thought of these preparations.\n\nMr. Brumley disappeared for a few minutes into the house.\n\nHe returned with a conscious relief on his face, clean hands, brushed\nknees, and his boots securely laced. He found Lady Harman already\npouring out tea.\n\n\"You see,\" she said, to excuse this pleasant enterprise on her part, \"my\nhusband has to be met at the station with the car.... And of course he\nhas no idea----\"\n\nShe left what it was of which Sir Isaac had no idea to the groping\nspeculations of Mr. Brumley.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a74\n\nThat evening Mr. Brumley was quite unable to work. His mind was full of\nthis beautiful dark lady who had come so unexpectedly into his world.\n\nPerhaps there are such things as premonitions. At any rate he had an\naltogether disproportionate sense of the significance of the afternoon's\nadventure,--which after all was a very small adventure indeed. A mere\ntalk. His mind refused to leave her, her black furry slenderness, her\ndark trustful eyes, the sweet firmness of her perfect lips, her\nappealing simplicity that was yet somehow compatible with the completest\nself-possession. He went over the incident of the board again and again,\nscraping his memory for any lurking crumb of detail as a starving man\nmight scrape an insufficient plate. Her dignity, her gracious frank\nforgiveness; no queen alive in these days could have touched her.... But\nit wasn't a mere elaborate admiration. There was something about her,\nabout the quality of their meeting.\n\nMost people know that sort of intimation. This person, it says, so fine,\nso brave, so distant still in so many splendid and impressive\nqualities, is yet in ways as yet undefined and unexplored, subtly and\nabundantly--for _you_. It was that made all her novelty and distinction\nand high quality and beauty so dominating among Mr. Brumley's thoughts.\nWithout that his interest might have been almost entirely--academic. But\nthere was woven all through her the hints of an imaginable alliance,\nwith _us_, with the things that are Brumley, with all that makes\nbeautiful little cottages and resents advertisements in lovely places,\nwith us as against something over there lurking behind that board,\nsomething else, something out of which she came. He vaguely adumbrated\nwhat it was out of which she came. A closed narrow life--with horrid\nvast enviable quantities of money. A life, could one use the word\n_vulgar_?--so that Carpaccio, Della Robbia, old furniture, a garden\nunostentatiously perfect, and the atmosphere of _belles-lettres_, seemed\nthings of another more desirable world. (She had never been abroad.) A\nworld, too, that would be so willing, so happy to enfold her, furs,\nfunds, freshness--everything.\n\nAnd all this was somehow animated by the stirring warmth in the June\nweather, for spring raised the sap in Mr. Brumley as well as in his\ntrees, had been a restless time for him all his life. This spring\nparticularly had sensitized him, and now a light had shone.\n\nHe was so unable to work that for twenty minutes he sat over a pleasant\nlittle essay on Shakespear's garden that by means of a concordance and\nhis natural aptitude he was writing for the book of the National\nShakespear Theatre, without adding a single fancy to its elegant\nplayfulness. Then he decided he needed his afternoon's walk after all,\nand he took cap and stick and went out, and presently found himself\nsurveying that yellow and blue board and seeing it from an entirely new\npoint of view....\n\nIt seemed to him that he hadn't made the best use of his conversational\nopportunities, and for a time this troubled him....\n\nToward the twilight he was walking along the path that runs through the\nheather along the edge of the rusty dark ironstone lake opposite the\npine-woods. He spoke his thoughts aloud to the discreet bat that flitted\nabout him. \"I wonder,\" he said, \"whether I shall ever set eyes on her\nagain....\"\n\nIn the small hours when he ought to have been fast asleep he decided she\nwould certainly take the house, and that he would see her again quite a\nnumber of times. A long tangle of unavoidable detail for discussion\nmight be improvised by an ingenious man. And the rest of that waking\ninterval passed in such inventions, which became more and more vague and\nmagnificent and familiar as Mr. Brumley lapsed into slumber again....\n\nNext day the garden essay was still neglected, and he wrote a pretty\nvague little song about an earthly mourner and a fresh presence that set\nhim thinking of the story of Persephone and how she passed in the\nspringtime up from the shadows again, blessing as she passed....\n\nHe pulled himself together about midday, cycled over to Gorshott for\nlunch at the clubhouse and a round with Horace Toomer in the afternoon,\nre-read the poem after tea, decided it was poor, tore it up and got\nhimself down to his little fantasy about Shakespear's Garden for a good\ntwo hours before supper. It was a sketch of that fortunate poet (whose\ndefinitive immortality is now being assured by an influential committee)\nwalking round his Stratford garden with his daughter, quoting himself\ncopiously with an accuracy and inappropriateness that reflected more\ncredit upon his heart than upon his head, and saying in addition many\ndistinctively Brumley things. When Mrs. Rabbit, with a solicitude\nacquired from the late Mrs. Brumley, asked him how he had got on with\nhis work--the sight of verse on his paper had made her anxious--he could\nanswer quite truthfully, \"Like a house afire.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE SECOND\n\nTHE PERSONALITY OF SIR ISAAC\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a71\n\nIt is to be remarked that two facts, usually esteemed as supremely\nimportant in the life of a woman, do not seem to have affected Mr.\nBrumley's state of mind nearly so much as quite trivial personal details\nabout Lady Harman. The first of these facts was the existence of the\nlady's four children, and the second, Sir Isaac.\n\nMr. Brumley did not think very much of either of these two facts; if he\nhad they would have spoilt the portrait in his mind; and when he did\nthink of them it was chiefly to think how remarkably little they were\nnecessary to that picture's completeness.\n\nHe spent some little time however trying to recall exactly what it was\nshe had said about her children. He couldn't now succeed in reproducing\nher words, if indeed it had been by anything so explicit as words that\nshe had conveyed to him that she didn't feel her children were\naltogether hers. \"Incidental results of the collapse of her girlhood,\"\ntried Mr. Brumley, \"when she married Harman.\"\n\nExpensive nurses, governesses--the best that money without prestige or\ntraining could buy. And then probably a mother-in-law.\n\nAnd as for Harman----?\n\nThere Mr. Brumley's mind desisted for sheer lack of material. Given this\nlady and that board and his general impression of Harman's refreshment\nand confectionery activity--the data were insufficient. A commonplace\nman no doubt, a tradesman, energetic perhaps and certainly a little\nbrassy, successful by the chances of that economic revolution which\neverywhere replaces the isolated shop by the syndicated enterprise,\nirrationally conceited about it; a man perhaps ultimately to be\npitied--with this young goddess finding herself.... Mr. Brumley's mind\nsat down comfortably to the more congenial theme of a young goddess\nfinding herself, and it was only very gradually in the course of several\ndays that the personality of Sir Isaac began to assume its proper\nimportance in the scheme of his imaginings.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a72\n\nIn the afternoon as he went round the links with Horace Toomer he got\nsome definite lights upon Sir Isaac.\n\nHis mind was so full of Lady Harman that he couldn't but talk of her\nvisit. \"I've a possible tenant for my cottage,\" he said as he and\nToomer, full of the sunny contentment of English gentlemen who had\nplayed a proper game in a proper manner, strolled back towards the\nclubhouse. \"That man Harman.\"\n\n\"Not the International Stores and Staminal Bread man.\"\n\n\"Yes. Odd. Considering my hatred of his board.\"\n\n\"He ought to pay--anyhow,\" said Toomer. \"They say he has a pretty wife\nand keeps her shut up.\"\n\n\"She came,\" said Brumley, neglecting to add the trifling fact that she\nhad come alone.\n\n\"Pretty?\"\n\n\"Charming, I thought.\"\n\n\"He's jealous of her. Someone was saying that the chauffeur has orders\nnot to take her into London--only for trips in the country. They live in\na big ugly house I'm told on Putney Hill. Did she in any way _look_--as\nthough----?\"\n\n\"Not in the least. If she isn't an absolutely straight young woman I've\nnever set eyes on one.\"\n\n\"_He_,\" said Toomer, \"is a disgusting creature.\"\n\n\"Morally?\"\n\n\"No, but--generally. Spends his life ruining little tradesmen, for the\nfun of the thing. He's three parts an invalid with some obscure kidney\ndisease. Sometimes he spends whole days in bed, drinking Contrex\u00c3\u00a9ville\nWater and planning the bankruptcy of decent men.... So the party made a\nknight of him.\"\n\n\"A party must have funds, Toomer.\"\n\n\"He didn't pay nearly enough. Blapton is an idiot with the honours. When\nit isn't Mrs. Blapton. What can you expect when ---- ----\"\n\n(But here Toomer became libellous.)\n\nToomer was an interesting type. He had a disagreeable disposition\nprofoundly modified by a public school and university training. Two\nantagonistic forces made him. He was the spirit of scurrility incarnate,\nthat was, as people say, innate; and by virtue of those moulding forces\nhe was doing his best to be an English gentleman. That mysterious\nimpulse which compels the young male to make objectionable imputations\nagainst seemly lives and to write rare inelegant words upon clean and\ndecent things burnt almost intolerably within him, and equally powerful\nnow was the gross craving he had acquired for personal association with\nall that is prominent, all that is successful, all that is of good\nreport. He had found his resultant in the censorious defence of\nestablished things. He conducted the _British Critic_, attacking with a\nmerciless energy all that was new, all that was critical, all those\nfresh and noble tentatives that admit of unsavoury interpretations, and\nwhen the urgent Yahoo in him carried him below the pretentious dignity\nof his accustomed organ he would squirt out his bitterness in a little\nsham facetious bookstall volume with a bright cover and quaint woodcuts,\nin which just as many prominent people as possible were mentioned by\nname and a sauce of general absurdity could be employed to cover and, if\nneed be, excuse particular libels. So he managed to relieve himself and\nget along. Harman was just on the border-line of the class he considered\nhimself free to revile. Harman was an outsider and aggressive and new,\none of Mrs. Blapton's knights, and of no particular weight in society;\nso far he was fair game; but he was not so new as he had been, he was\nalmost through with the running of the Toomer gauntlet, he had a\ntremendous lot of money and it was with a modified vehemence that the\ndistinguished journalist and humourist expatiated on his offensiveness\nto Mr. Brumley. He talked in a gentle, rather weary voice, that came\nthrough a moustache like a fringe of light tobacco.\n\n\"Personally I've little against the man. A wife too young for him and\njealously guarded, but that's all to his credit. Nowadays. If it wasn't\nfor his blatancy in his business.... And the knighthood.... I suppose he\ncan't resist taking anything he can get. Bread made by wholesale and\ndistributed like a newspaper can't, I feel, be the same thing as the\nloaf of your honest old-fashioned baker--each loaf made with individual\nattention--out of wholesome English flour--hand-ground--with a personal\ntouch for each customer. Still, everything drifts on to these\nhugger-mugger large enterprises; Chicago spreads over the world. One\nthing goes after another, tobacco, tea, bacon, drugs, bookselling.\nDecent homes destroyed right and left. Not Harman's affair, I suppose.\nThe girls in his London tea-shops have of course to supplement their\nwages by prostitution--probably don't object to that nowadays\nconsidering the novels we have. And his effect on the landscape----Until\nthey stopped him he was trying very hard to get Shakespear's Cliff at\nDover. He did for a time have the Toad Rock at Tunbridge.\nStill\"--something like a sigh escaped from Toomer,--\"his private life\nappears to be almost as blameless as anybody's can be.... Thanks no\ndoubt to his defective health. I made the most careful enquiries when\nhis knighthood was first discussed. Someone has to. Before his marriage\nhe seems to have lived at home with his mother. At Highbury. Very\nquietly and inexpensively.\"\n\n\"Then he's not the conventional vulgarian?\"\n\n\"Much more of the Rockefeller type. Bad health, great concentration,\norganizing power.... Applied of course to a narrower range of\nbusiness.... I'm glad I'm not a small confectioner in a town he wants to\ntake up.\"\n\n\"He's--hard?\"\n\n\"Merciless. Hasn't the beginnings of an idea of fair play.... None at\nall.... No human give or take.... Are you going to have tea here, or are\nyou walking back now?\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a73\n\nIt was fully a week before Mr. Brumley heard anything more of Lady\nHarman. He began to fear that this shining furry presence would glorify\nBlack Strand no more. Then came a telegram that filled him with the\nliveliest anticipations. It was worded: \"Coming see cottage Saturday\nafternoon Harman....\"\n\nOn Saturday morning Mr. Brumley dressed with an apparent ease and\nunusual care....\n\nHe worked rather discursively before lunch. His mind was busy picking up\nthe ends of their previous conversation and going on with them to all\nsorts of bright knots, bows and elegant cats' cradling. He planned\nopenings that might give her tempting opportunities of confidences if\nshe wished to confide, and artless remarks and questions that would make\nfor self-betrayal if she didn't. And he thought of her, he thought of\nher imaginatively, this secluded rare thing so happily come to him, who\nwas so young, so frank and fresh and so unhappily married (he was sure)\nto a husband at least happily mortal. Yes, dear Reader, even on that\nopening morning Mr. Brumley's imagination, trained very largely upon\nVictorian literature and _belles-lettres_, leapt forward to the very\nending of this story.... We, of course, do nothing of the sort, our lot\nis to follow a more pedestrian route.... He lapsed into a vague series\nof meditations, slower perhaps but essentially similar, after his\ntemperate palatable lunch.\n\nHe was apprised of the arrival of his visitor by the sudden indignant\nyaup followed by the general subdued uproar of a motor-car outside the\nfront door, even before Clarence, this time amazingly prompt, assaulted\nthe bell. Then the whole house was like that poem by Edgar Allan Poe,\none magnificent texture of clangour.\n\nAt the first toot of the horn Mr. Brumley had moved swiftly into the\nbay, and screened partly by the life-size Venus of Milo that stood in\nthe bay window, and partly by the artistic curtains, surveyed the\nglittering vehicle. He was first aware of a vast fur coat enclosing a\nlean grey-headed obstinate-looking man with a diabetic complexion who\nwas fumbling with the door of the car and preventing Clarence's\nassistance. Mr. Brumley was able to remark that the gentleman's nose\nprojected to a sharpened point, and that his thin-lipped mouth was all\nawry and had a kind of habitual compression, the while that his eyes\nsought eagerly for the other occupant of the car. She was unaccountably\ninvisible. Could it be that that hood really concealed her? Could it\nbe?...\n\nThe white-faced gentleman descended, relieved himself tediously of the\nvast fur coat, handed it to Clarence and turned to the house.\nReverentially Clarence placed the coat within the automobile and closed\nthe door. Still the protesting mind of Mr. Brumley refused to\nbelieve!...\n\nHe heard the house-door open and Mrs. Rabbit in colloquy with a flat\nmasculine voice. He heard his own name demanded and conceded. Then a\nsilence, not the faintest suggestion of a feminine rustle, and then the\nsound of Mrs. Rabbit at the door-handle. Conviction stormed the last\nfastness of the disappointed author's mind.\n\n\"Oh _damn_!\" he shouted with extreme fervour.\n\nHe had never imagined it was possible that Sir Isaac could come alone.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a74\n\nBut the house had to be let, and it had to be let to Sir Isaac Harman.\nIn another moment an amiable though distinguished man of letters was in\nthe hall interviewing the great _entrepreneur_.\n\nThe latter gentleman was perhaps three inches shorter than Mr. Brumley,\nhis hair was grey-shot brown, his face clean-shaven, his features had a\nthin irregularity, and he was dressed in a neat brown suit with a\nnecktie very exactly matching it. \"Sir Isaac Harman?\" said Mr. Brumley\nwith a note of gratification.\n\n\"That's it,\" said Sir Isaac. He appeared to be nervous and a little out\nof breath. \"Come,\" he said, \"just to look over it. Just to see it.\nProbably too small, but if it doesn't put you out----\"\n\nHe blew out the skin of his face about his mouth a little.\n\n\"Delighted to see you anyhow,\" said Mr. Brumley, filling the world of\nunspoken things with singularly lurid curses.\n\n\"This. Nice little hall,--very,\" said Sir Isaac. \"Pretty, that bit at\nthe end. Many rooms are there?\"\n\nMr. Brumley answered inexactly and meditated a desperate resignation of\nthe whole job to Mrs. Rabbit. Then he made an effort and began to\nexplain.\n\n\"That clock,\" said Sir Isaac interrupting in the dining-room, \"is a\nfake.\"\n\nMr. Brumley made silent interrogations.\n\n\"Been there myself,\" said Sir Isaac. \"They sell those brass fittings in\nHo'bun.\"\n\nThey went upstairs together. When Mr. Brumley wasn't explaining or\npointing out, Sir Isaac made a kind of whistling between his clenched\nteeth. \"This bathroom wants refitting anyhow,\" he said abruptly. \"I\ndaresay Lady Harman would like that room with the bay--but it's\nall--small. It's really quite pretty; you've done it cleverly, but--the\nsize of it! I'd have to throw out a wing. And that you know might spoil\nthe style. That roof,--a gardener's cottage?... I thought it might be.\nWhat's this other thing here? Old barn. Empty? That might expand a bit.\nCouldn't do only just this anyhow.\"\n\nHe walked in front of Mr. Brumley downstairs and still emitting that\nfaint whistle led the way into the garden. He seemed to regard Mr.\nBrumley merely as a source of answers to his questions, and a seller in\nprocess of preparation for an offer. It was clear he meant to make an\noffer. \"It's not the house I should buy if I was alone in this,\" he\nsaid, \"but Lady Harman's taken a fancy somehow. And it might be\nadapted....\"\n\nFrom first to last Mr. Brumley never said a single word about Euphemia\nand the young matrimony and all the other memories this house enshrined.\nHe felt instinctively that it would not affect Sir Isaac one way or the\nother. He tried simply to seem indifferent to whether Sir Isaac bought\nthe place or not. He tried to make it appear almost as if houses like\nthis often happened to him, and interested him only in the most\nincidental manner. They had their proper price, he tried to convey,\nwhich of course no gentleman would underbid.\n\nIn the exquisite garden Sir Isaac said: \"One might make a very pretty\nlittle garden of this--if one opened it out a bit.\"\n\nAnd of the sunken rock-garden: \"That might be dangerous of a dark\nnight.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" he said, indicating the hill of pines behind, \"one could\nbuy or lease some of that. If one wanted to throw it into the place and\nopen out more.\n\n\"From my point of view,\" he said, \"it isn't a house. It's----\" He sought\nin his mind for an expression--\"a Cottage Ornay.\"\n\nThis history declines to record either what Mr. Brumley said or what he\ndid not say.\n\nSir Isaac surveyed the house thoughtfully for some moments from the turf\nedging of the great herbaceous border.\n\n\"How far,\" he asked, \"is it from the nearest railway station?...\"\n\nMr. Brumley gave details.\n\n\"Four miles. And an infrequent service? Nothing in any way suburban?\nBetter to motor into Guildford and get the Express. H'm.... And what\nsort of people do we get about here?\"\n\nMr. Brumley sketched.\n\n\"Mildly horsey. That's not bad. No officers about?... Nothing nearer\nthan Aldershot.... That's eleven miles, is it? H'm. I suppose there\naren't any _literary_ people about here, musicians or that kind of\nthing, no advanced people of that sort?\"\n\n\"Not when I've gone,\" said Mr. Brumley, with the faintest flavour of\nhumour.\n\nSir Isaac stared at him for a moment with eyes vacantly thoughtful.\n\n\"It mightn't be so bad,\" said Sir Isaac, and whistled a little between\nhis teeth.\n\nMr. Brumley was suddenly minded to take his visitor to see the view and\nthe effect of his board upon it. But he spoke merely of the view and\nleft Sir Isaac to discover the board or not as he thought fit. As they\nascended among the trees, the visitor was manifestly seized by some\nstrange emotion, his face became very white, he gasped and blew for\nbreath, he felt for his face with a nervous hand.\n\n\"Four thousand,\" he said suddenly. \"An outside price.\"\n\n\"A minimum,\" said Mr. Brumley, with a slight quickening of the pulse.\n\n\"You won't get three eight,\" gasped Sir Isaac.\n\n\"Not a business man, but my agent tells me----\" panted Mr. Brumley.\n\n\"Three eight,\" said Sir Isaac.\n\n\"We're just coming to the view,\" said Mr. Brumley. \"Just coming to the\nview.\"\n\n\"Practically got to rebuild the house,\" said Sir Isaac.\n\n\"There!\" said Mr. Brumley, and waved an arm widely.\n\nSir Isaac regarded the prospect with a dissatisfied face. His pallor had\ngiven place to a shiny, flushed appearance, his nose, his ears, and his\ncheeks were pink. He blew his face out, and seemed to be studying the\nlandscape for defects. \"This might be built over at any time,\" he\ncomplained.\n\nMr. Brumley was reassuring.\n\nFor a brief interval Sir Isaac's eyes explored the countryside vaguely,\nthen his expression seemed to concentrate and run together to a point.\n\"H'm,\" he said.\n\n\"That board,\" he remarked, \"quite wrong there.\"\n\n\"_Well!_\" said Mr. Brumley, too surprised for coherent speech.\n\n\"Quite,\" said Sir Isaac Harman. \"Don't you see what's the matter?\"\n\nMr. Brumley refrained from an eloquent response.\n\n\"They ought to be,\" Sir Isaac went on, \"white and a sort of green. Like\nthe County Council notices on Hampstead Heath. So as to blend.... You\nsee, an ad. that hits too hard is worse than no ad. at all. It leaves a\ndislike.... Advertisements ought to blend. It ought to seem as though\nall this view were saying it. Not just that board. Now suppose we had a\nshade of very light brown, a kind of light khaki----\"\n\nHe turned a speculative eye on Mr. Brumley as if he sought for the\neffect of this latter suggestion on him.\n\n\"If the whole board was invisible----\" said Mr. Brumley.\n\nSir Isaac considered it. \"Just the letters showing,\" he said. \"No,--that\nwould be going too far in the other direction.\"\n\nHe made a faint sucking noise with his lips and teeth as he surveyed the\nlandscape and weighed this important matter....\n\n\"Queer how one gets ideas,\" he said at last, turning away. \"It was my\nwife told me about that board.\"\n\nHe stopped to survey the house from the exact point of view his wife had\ntaken nine days before. \"I wouldn't give this place a second thought,\"\nsaid Sir Isaac, \"if it wasn't for Lady Harman.\"\n\nHe confided. \"_She_ wants a week-end cottage. But _I_ don't see why it\n_should_ be a week-end cottage. I don't see why it shouldn't be made\ninto a nice little country house. Compact, of course. By using up that\nbarn.\"\n\nHe inhaled three bars of a tune. \"London,\" he explained, \"doesn't suit\nLady Harman.\"\n\n\"Health?\" asked Mr. Brumley, all alert.\n\n\"It isn't her health exactly,\" Sir Isaac dropped out. \"You see--she's a\nyoung woman. She gets ideas.\"\n\n\"You know,\" he continued, \"I'd like to have a look at that barn again.\nIf we develop that--and a sort of corridor across where the shrubs\nare--and ran out offices....\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a75\n\nMr. Brumley's mind was still vigorously struggling with the flaming\nimplications of Sir Isaac's remark that Lady Harman \"got ideas,\" and Sir\nIsaac was gently whistling his way towards an offer of three thousand\nnine hundred when they came down out of the pines into the path along\nthe edge of the herbaceous border. And then Mr. Brumley became aware of\nan effect away between the white-stemmed trees towards the house as if\nthe Cambridge boat-race crew was indulging in a vigorous scrimmage.\nDrawing nearer this resolved itself into the fluent contours of Lady\nBeach-Mandarin, dressed in sky-blue and with a black summer straw hat\nlarger than ever and trimmed effusively with marguerites.\n\n\"Here,\" said Sir Isaac, \"can't I get off? You've got a friend.\"\n\n\"You must have some tea,\" said Mr. Brumley, who wanted to suggest that\nthey should agree to Sir Isaac's figure of three thousand eight hundred,\nbut not as pounds but guineas. It seemed to him a suggestion that might\nprove insidiously attractive. \"It's a charming lady, my friend Lady\nBeach-Mandarin. She'll be delighted----\"\n\n\"I don't think I can,\" said Sir Isaac. \"Not in the habit--social\noccasions.\"\n\nHis face expressed a panic terror of this gallant full-rigged lady ahead\nof them.\n\n\"But you see now,\" said Mr. Brumley, with a detaining grip, \"it's\nunavoidable.\"\n\nAnd the next moment Sir Isaac was mumbling his appreciations of the\nintroduction.\n\nI must admit that Lady Beach-Mandarin was almost as much to meet as one\ncan meet in a single human being, a broad abundant billowing personality\nwith a taste for brims, streamers, pennants, panniers, loose sleeves,\nsweeping gestures, top notes and the like that made her altogether less\nlike a woman than an occasion of public rejoicing. Even her large blue\neyes projected, her chin and brows and nose all seemed racing up to the\nfront of her as if excited by the clarion notes of her abundant voice,\nand the pinkness of her complexion was as exuberant as her manners.\nExuberance--it was her word. She had evidently been a big, bouncing,\nbright gaminesque girl at fifteen, and very amusing and very much\nadmired; she had liked the r\u00c3\u00b4le and she had not so much grown older as\nsuffered enlargement--a very considerable enlargement.\n\n\"Ah!\" she cried, \"and so I've caught you at home, Mr. Brumley! And, poor\ndear, you're at my mercy.\" And she shook both his hands with both of\nhers.\n\nThat was before Mr. Brumley introduced Sir Isaac, a thing he did so soon\nas he could get one of his hands loose and wave a surviving digit or so\nat that gentleman.\n\n\"You see, Sir Isaac,\" she said, taking him in, in the most generous way;\n\"I and Mr. Brumley are old friends. We knew each other of yore. We have\nour jokes.\"\n\nSir Isaac seemed to feel the need of speech but got no further than a\nuseful all-round noise.\n\n\"And one of them is that when I want him to do the least little thing\nfor me he hides away! Always. By a sort of instinct. It's such a Small\nthing, Sir Isaac.\"\n\nSir Isaac was understood to say vaguely that they always did. But he had\nbecome very indistinct.\n\n\"Aren't I always at your service?\" protested Mr. Brumley with a\nresponsive playfulness. \"And I don't even know what it is you want.\"\n\nLady Beach-Mandarin, addressing herself exclusively to Sir Isaac, began\na tale of a Shakespear Bazaar she was holding in an adjacent village,\nand how she knew Mr. Brumley (naughty man) meant to refuse to give her\nautographed copies of his littlest book for the Book Stall she was\norganizing. Mr. Brumley confuted her gaily and generously. So\ndiscoursing they made their way to the verandah where Lady Harman had so\nlately \"poured.\"\n\nSir Isaac was borne along upon the lady's stream of words in a state of\nmulish reluctance, nodding, saying \"Of course\" and similar phrases, and\nwishing he was out of it all with an extreme manifestness. He drank his\ntea with unmistakable discomfort, and twice inserted into the\nconversation an entirely irrelevant remark that he had to be going. But\nLady Beach-Mandarin had her purposes with him and crushed these\nquivering tentatives.\n\nLady Beach-Mandarin had of course like everybody else at that time her\nown independent movement in the great national effort to create an\nofficial British Theatre upon the basis of William Shakespear, and she\nsaw in the as yet unenlisted resources of Sir Isaac strong possibilities\nof reinforcement of her own particular contribution to the great Work.\nHe was manifestly shy and sulky and disposed to bolt at the earliest\npossible moment, and so she set herself now with a swift and\nconcentrated combination of fascination and urgency to commit him to\nparticipations. She flattered and cajoled and bribed. She was convinced\nthat even to be called upon by Lady Beach-Mandarin is no light\nprivilege for these new commercial people, and so she made no secret of\nher intention of decorating the hall of his large but undistinguished\nhouse in Putney, with her redeeming pasteboard. She appealed to the\ninstances of Venice and Florence to show that \"such men as you, Sir\nIsaac,\" who control commerce and industry, have always been the\nguardians and patrons of art. And who more worthy of patronage than\nWilliam Shakespear? Also she said that men of such enormous wealth as\nhis owed something to their national tradition. \"You have to pay your\nfooting, Sir Isaac,\" she said with impressive vagueness.\n\n\"Putting it in round figures,\" said Sir Isaac, suddenly and with a white\ngleam of animosity in his face, the animosity of a trapped animal at the\nsight of its captors, \"what does coming on your Committee mean, Lady\nBeach-Mandarin?\"\n\n\"It's your name we want,\" said the lady, \"but I'm sure you'd not be\nungenerous. The tribute success owes the arts.\"\n\n\"A hundred?\" he threw out,--his ears red.\n\n\"Guineas,\" breathed Lady Beach-Mandarin with a lofty sweetness of\nconsent.\n\nHe stood up hastily as if to escape further exaction, and the lady rose\ntoo.\n\n\"And you'll let me call on Lady Harman,\" she said, honestly doing her\npart in the bargain.\n\n\"Can't keep the car waiting,\" was what Brumley could distinguish in his\nreply.\n\n\"I expect you have a perfectly splendid car, Sir Isaac,\" said Lady\nBeach-Mandarin, drawing him out. \"Quite the modernest thing.\"\n\nSir Isaac replied with the reluctance of an Income Tax Return that it\nwas a forty-five Rolls Royce, good of course but nothing amazing.\n\n\"We must see it,\" she said, and turned his retreat into a procession.\n\nShe admired the car, she admired the colour of the car, she admired the\nlamps of the car and the door of the car and the little fittings of the\ncar. She admired the horn. She admired the twist of the horn. She\nadmired Clarence and the uniform of Clarence and she admired and coveted\nthe great fur coat that he held ready for his employer. (But if she had\nit, she said, she would wear the splendid fur outside to show every\nlittle bit of it.) And when the car at last moved forward and\ntooted--she admired the note--and vanished softly and swiftly through\nthe gates, she was left in the porch with Mr. Brumley still by sheer\ninertia admiring and envying. She admired Sir Isaac's car number Z 900.\n(Such an easy one to remember!) Then she stopped abruptly, as one might\ndiscover that the water in the bathroom was running to waste and turn it\noff.\n\nShe had a cynicism as exuberant as the rest of her.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, with a contented sigh and an entire flattening of her\ntone, \"I laid it on pretty thick that time.... I wonder if he'll send me\nthat hundred guineas or whether I shall have to remind him of it....\"\nHer manner changed again to that of a gigantic gamin. \"I mean to have\nthat money,\" she said with bright determination and round eyes....\n\nShe reflected and other thoughts came to her. \"Plutocracy,\" she said,\n\"_is_ perfectly detestable, don't you think so, Mr. Brumley?\" ... And\nthen, \"I can't _imagine_ how a man who deals in bread and confectionery\ncan manage to go about so completely half-baked.\"\n\n\"He's a very remarkable type,\" said Mr. Brumley.\n\nHe became urgent: \"I do hope, dear Lady Beach-Mandarin, you will\ncontrive to call on Lady Harman. She is--in relation to _that_--quite\nthe most interesting woman I have seen.\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a76\n\nPresently as they paced the croquet lawn together, the preoccupation of\nMr. Brumley's mind drew their conversation back to Lady Harman.\n\n\"I wish,\" he repeated, \"you would go and see these people. She's not at\nall what you might infer from him.\"\n\n\"What could one infer about a wife from a man like that? Except that\nshe'd have a lot to put up with.\"\n\n\"You know,--she's a beautiful person, tall, slender, dark....\"\n\nLady Beach-Mandarin turned her full blue eye upon him.\n\n\"_Now!_\" she said archly.\n\n\"I'm interested in the incongruity.\"\n\nLady Beach-Mandarin's reply was silent and singular. She compressed her\nlips very tightly, fixed her eye firmly on Mr. Brumley's, lifted her\nfinger to the level of her left eyelash, and then shook it at him very\ndeliberately five times. Then with a little sigh and a sudden and\ncomplete restoration of manner she remarked that never in any year\nbefore had she seen peonies quite so splendid. \"I've a peculiar sympathy\nwith peonies,\" she said. \"They're so exactly my style.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE THIRD\n\nLADY HARMAN AT HOME\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a71\n\nExactly three weeks after that first encounter between Lady\nBeach-Mandarin and Sir Isaac Harman, Mr. Brumley found himself one of a\nluncheon party at that lady's house in Temperley Square and talking very\nfreely and indiscreetly about the Harmans.\n\nLady Beach-Mandarin always had her luncheons in a family way at a large\nround table so that nobody could get out of her range, and she insisted\nupon conversation being general, except for her mother who was\nimpenetrably deaf and the Swiss governess of her only daughter Phyllis\nwho was incomprehensible in any European tongue. The mother was\nincalculably old and had been a friend of Victor Hugo and Alfred de\nMusset; she maintained an intermittent monologue about the private lives\nof those great figures; nobody paid the slightest attention to her but\none felt she enriched the table with an undertow of literary\nassociations. A small dark stealthy butler and a convulsive boy with\nhair (apparently) taking the place of eyes waited. On this occasion Lady\nBeach-Mandarin had gathered together two cousins, maiden ladies from\nPerth, wearing valiant hats, Toomer the wit and censor, and Miss\nSharsper the novelist (whom Toomer detested), a gentleman named Roper\nwhom she had invited under a misapprehension that he was the Arctic\nRoper, and Mr. Brumley. She had tried Mr. Roper with questions about\npenguins, seals, cold and darkness, icebergs and glaciers, Captain\nScott, Doctor Cook and the shape of the earth, and all in vain, and\nfeeling at last that something was wrong, she demanded abruptly whether\nMr. Brumley had sold his house.\n\n\"I'm selling it,\" said Mr. Brumley, \"by almost imperceptible degrees.\"\n\n\"He haggles?\"\n\n\"Haggles and higgles. He higgles passionately. He goes white and breaks\ninto a cold perspiration. He wants me now to include the gardener's\ntools--in whatever price we agree upon.\"\n\n\"A rich man like that ought to be easy and generous,\" said Lady\nBeach-Mandarin.\n\n\"Then he wouldn't be a rich man like that,\" said Mr. Toomer.\n\n\"But doesn't it distress you highly, Mr. Brumley,\" one of the Perth\nladies asked, \"to be leaving Euphemia's Home to strangers? The man may\ngo altering it.\"\n\n\"That--that weighs with me very much,\" said Mr. Brumley, recalled to his\nprofessions. \"There--I put my trust in Lady Harman.\"\n\n\"You've seen her again?\" asked Lady Beach-Mandarin.\n\n\"Yes. She came with him--a few days ago. That couple interests me more\nand more. So little akin.\"\n\n\"There's eighteen years between them,\" said Toomer.\n\n\"It's one of those cases,\" began Mr. Brumley with a note of scientific\ndetachment, \"where one is really tempted to be ultra-feminist. It's\nclear, he uses every advantage. He's her owner, her keeper, her\nobstinate insensitive little tyrant.... And yet there's a sort of\neffect, as though nothing was decided.... As if she was only just\ngrowing up.\"\n\n\"They've been married six or seven years,\" said Toomer. \"She was just\neighteen.\"\n\n\"They went over the house together and whenever she spoke he\ncontradicted her with a sort of vicious playfulness. Tried to poke\nclumsy fun at her. Called her 'Lady Harman.' Only it was quite evident\nthat what she said stuck in his mind.... Very queer--interesting\npeople.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't have anyone allowed to marry until they were\nfive-and-twenty,\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin.\n\n\"Sweet seventeen sometimes contrives to be very marriageable,\" said the\ngentleman named Roper.\n\n\"Sweet seventeen must contrive to wait,\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin.\n\"Sweet fourteen has to--and when I was fourteen--I was Ardent! There's\nno earthly objection to a little harmless flirtation of course. It's the\nmarrying.\"\n\n\"You'd conduce to romance,\" said Miss Sharsper, \"anyhow. Eighteen won't\nbear restriction and everyone would begin by eloping--illegally.\"\n\n\"I'd put them back,\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin. \"Oh! remorselessly.\"\n\nMr. Roper, who was more and more manifestly not the Arctic one, remarked\nthat she would \"give the girls no end of an adolescence....\"\n\nMr. Brumley did not attend very closely to the subsequent conversation.\nHis mind had gone back to Black Strand and the second visit that Lady\nHarman, this time under her natural and proper protection, had paid him.\nA little thread from the old lady's discourse drifted by him. She had\nscented marriage in the air and she was saying, \"of course they ought to\nhave let Victor Hugo marry over and over again. He would have made it\nall so beautiful. He could throw a Splendour over--over almost\nanything.\" Mr. Brumley sank out of attention altogether. It was so\ndifficult to express his sense of Lady Harman as a captive, enclosed but\nunsubdued. She had been as open and shining as a celandine flower in the\nsunshine on that first invasion, but on the second it had been like\novercast weather and her starry petals had been shut and still. She\nhadn't been in the least subdued or effaced, but closed, inaccessible to\nconversational bees, that astonishing honey of trust and easy friendship\nhad been hidden in a dignified impenetrable reserve. She had had the\neffect of being not so much specially shut against Mr. Brumley as\nhabitually shut against her husband, as a protection against his\ncontinual clumsy mental interferences. And once when Sir Isaac had made\na sudden allusion to price Mr. Brumley had glanced at her and met her\neyes....\n\n\"Of course,\" he said, coming up to the conversational surface again, \"a\nwoman like that is bound to fight her way out.\"\n\n\"Queen Mary!\" cried Miss Sharsper. \"Fight her way out!\"\n\n\"Queen Mary!\" said Mr. Brumley, \"No!--Lady Harman.\"\n\n\"_I_ was talking of Queen Mary,\" said Miss Sharsper.\n\n\"And Mr. Brumley was thinking of Lady Harman!\" cried Lady\nBeach-Mandarin.\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Brumley, \"I confess I do think about her. She seems to\nme to be so typical in many ways of--of everything that is weak in the\nfeminine position. As a type--yes, she's perfect.\"\n\n\"I've never seen this lady,\" said Miss Sharsper. \"Is she beautiful?\"\n\n\"I've not seen her myself yet,\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin. \"She's Mr.\nBrumley's particular discovery.\"\n\n\"You haven't called?\" he asked with a faint reproach.\n\n\"But I've been going to--oh! tremendously. And you revive all my\ncuriosity. Why shouldn't some of us this very afternoon----?\"\n\nShe caught at her own passing idea and held it. \"Let's Go,\" she cried.\n\"Let's visit the wife of this Ogre, the last of the women in captivity.\nWe'll take the big car and make a party and call _en masse_.\"\n\nMr. Toomer protested he had no morbid curiosities.\n\n\"But you, Susan?\"\n\nMiss Sharsper declared she would _love_ to come. Wasn't it her business\nto study out-of-the-way types? Mr. Roper produced a knowing sort of\nengagement--\"I'm provided for already, Lady Beach-Mandarin,\" he said,\nand the cousins from Perth had to do some shopping.\n\n\"Then we three will be the expedition,\" said the hostess. \"And\nafterwards if we survive we'll tell you our adventures. It's a house on\nPutney Hill, isn't it, where this Christian maiden, so to speak, is held\ncaptive? I've had her in my mind, but I've always intended to call with\nAgatha Alimony; she's so inspiring to down-trodden women.\"\n\n\"Not exactly down-trodden,\" said Mr. Brumley, \"not down-trodden. That's\nwhat's so curious about it.\"\n\n\"And what shall we do when we get there?\" cried Lady Beach-Mandarin. \"I\nfeel we ought to do something more than call. Can't we carry her off\nright away, Mr. Brumley? I want to go right in to her and say 'Look\nhere! I'm on your side. Your husband's a tyrant. I'm help and rescue.\nI'm all that a woman ought to be--fine and large. Come out from under\nthat unworthy man's heel!'\"\n\n\"Suppose she isn't at all the sort of person you seem to think she is,\"\nsaid Miss Sharsper. \"And suppose she came!\"\n\n\"Suppose she didn't,\" reflected Mr. Roper.\n\n\"I seem to see your flight,\" said Mr. Toomer. \"And the newspaper\nplacards and head-lines. 'Lady Beach-Mandarin elopes with the wife of an\neminent confectioner. She is stopped at the landing stage by the staff\nof the Dover Branch establishment. Recapture of the fugitive after a hot\nstruggle. Brumley, the eminent _litt\u00c3\u00a9rateur_, stunned by a spent\nbun....'\"\n\n\"We're all talking great nonsense,\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin. \"But\nanyhow we'll make our call. And _I_ know!--I'll make her accept an\ninvitation to lunch without him.\"\n\n\"If she won't?\" threw out Mr. Roper.\n\n\"I _will_,\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin with roguish determination. \"And if\nI can't----\"\n\n\"Not ask him too!\" protested Mr. Brumley.\n\n\"Why not get her to come to your Social Friends meeting,\" said Miss\nSharsper.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a72\n\nWhen Mr. Brumley found himself fairly launched upon this expedition he\nhad the grace to feel compunction. The Harmans, he perceived, had\ninadvertently made him the confidant of their domestic discords and to\nbetray them to these others savoured after all of treachery. And besides\nmuch as he had craved to see Lady Harman again, he now realized he\ndidn't in the least want to see her in association with the exuberant\nvolubility of Lady Beach-Mandarin and the hard professional\nobservation, so remarkably like the ferrule of an umbrella being poked\nwith a noiseless persistence into one's eye, of Miss Sharsper. And as he\nthought these afterthoughts Lady Beach-Mandarin's chauffeur darted and\ndodged and threaded his way with an alacrity that was almost distressing\nto Putney.\n\nThey ran over the ghost of Swinburne, at the foot of Putney Hill,--or\nperhaps it was only the rhythm of the engine changed for a moment, and\nin a couple of minutes more they were outside the Harman residence.\n\"Here we are!\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin, more capaciously gaminesque\nthan ever. \"We've done it now.\"\n\nMr. Brumley had an impression of a big house in the distended\nstately-homes-of-England style and very necessarily and abundantly\ncovered by creepers and then he was assisting the ladies to descend and\nthe three of them were waiting clustered in the ample Victorian doorway.\nFor some little interval there came no answer to the bell Mr. Brumley\nhad rung, but all three of them had a sense of hurried, furtive and\nnoiseless readjustments in progress behind the big and bossy oak door.\nThen it opened and a very large egg-shaped butler with sandy whiskers\nappeared and looked down himself at them. There was something paternal\nabout this man, his professional deference was touched by the sense of\nultimate responsibility. He seemed to consider for a moment whether he\nshould permit Lady Harman to be in, before he conceded that she was.\n\nThey were ushered through a hall that resembled most of the halls in the\nworld, it was dominated by a handsome oak staircase and scarcely gave\nMiss Sharsper a point, and then across a creation of the Victorian\narchitect, a massive kind of conservatory with classical touches--there\nwas an impluvium in the centre and there were arches hung with\nmanifestly costly Syrian rugs, into a large apartment looking through\nfour French windows upon a verandah and a large floriferous garden. At a\nsideways glance it seemed a very pleasant garden indeed. The room itself\nwas like the rooms of so many prosperous people nowadays; it had an\neffect of being sedulously and yet irrelevantly over-furnished. It had\nnone of the large vulgarity that Mr. Brumley would have considered\nproper to a wealthy caterer, but it confessed a compilation of \"pieces\"\nvery carefully authenticated. Some of them were rather splendid\n\"pieces\"; three big bureaus burly and brassy dominated it; there was a\nQueen Anne cabinet, some exquisite coloured engravings, an ormolu mirror\nand a couple of large French vases that set Miss Sharsper, who had a\nkeen eye for this traffic, confusedly cataloguing. And a little\nincongruously in the midst of this exhibit, stood Lady Harman, as if she\nwas trying to conceal the fact that she too was a visitor, in a creamy\nwhite dress and dark and defensive and yet entirely unabashed.\n\nThe great butler gave his large vague impression of Lady\nBeach-Mandarin's name, and stood aside and withdrew.\n\n\"I've heard so much of you,\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin advancing with\nhand upraised. \"I had to call. Mr. Brumley----\"\n\n\"Lady Beach-Mandarin met Sir Isaac at Black Strand,\" Mr. Brumley\nintervened to explain.\n\nMiss Sharsper was as it were introduced by default.\n\n\"My vividest anticipations outdone,\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin, squeezing\nLady Harman's fingers with enthusiasm. \"And what a charming garden you\nhave, and what a delightful situation! Such air! And on the very verge\nof London, high, on this delightful _literary_ hill, and ready at any\nmoment to swoop in that enviable great car of yours. I suppose you come\na great deal into London, Lady Harman?\"\n\n\"No,\" reflected Lady Harman, \"not very much.\" She seemed to weigh the\naccuracy of this very carefully. \"No,\" she added in confirmation.\n\n\"But you should, you ought to; it's your duty. You've no right to hide\naway from us. I was telling Sir Isaac. We look to him, we look to you.\nYou've no right to bury your talents away from us; you who are rich and\nyoung and brilliant and beautiful----\"\n\n\"But if I go on I shall begin to flatter you,\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin\nwith a delicious smile. \"I've begun upon Sir Isaac already. I've made\nhim promise a hundred guineas and his name to the Shakespear Dinners\nSociety,--nothing he didn't mention eaten (_you_ know) and all the\nprofits to the National movement--and I want your name too. I know\nyou'll let us have your name too. Grant me that, and I'll subside into\nthe ordinariest of callers.\"\n\n\"But surely; isn't his name enough?\" asked Lady Harman.\n\n\"Without yours, it's only half a name!\" cried Lady Beach-Mandarin. \"If\nit were a _business_ thing----! Different of course. But on my list, I'm\nlike dear old Queen Victoria you know, the wives must come too.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" hesitated Lady Harman.... \"But really I think Sir\nIsaac----\"\n\nShe stopped. And then Mr. Brumley had a psychic experience. It seemed to\nhim as he stood observing Lady Harman with an entirely unnecessary and\nunpremeditated intentness, that for the briefest interval her attention\nflashed over Lady Beach-Mandarin's shoulder to the end verandah window;\nand following her glance, he saw--and then he did not see--the arrested\nfigure, the white face of Sir Isaac, bearing an expression in which\nanger and horror were extraordinarily intermingled. If it was Sir Isaac\nhe dodged back with amazing dexterity; if it was a phantom of the living\nit vanished with an air of doing that. Without came the sound of a\nflower-pot upset and a faint expletive. Mr. Brumley looked very quickly\nat Lady Beach-Mandarin, who was entirely unconscious of anything but her\nown uncoiling and enveloping eloquence, and as quickly at Miss Sharsper.\nBut Miss Sharsper was examining a blackish bureau through her glasses as\nthough she were looking for birthmarks and meant if she could find one\nto claim the piece as her own long-lost connection. With a mild but\ngratifying sense of exclusive complicity Mr. Brumley reverted to Lady\nHarman's entire self-possession.\n\n\"But, dear Lady Harman, it's entirely unnecessary you should consult\nhim,--entirely,\" Lady Beach-Mandarin was saying.\n\n\"I'm sure,\" said Mr. Brumley with a sense that somehow he had to\nintervene, \"that Sir Isaac would not possibly object. I'm sure that if\nLady Harman consults him----\"\n\nThe sandy-whiskered butler appeared hovering.\n\n\"Shall I place the tea-things in the garden, me lady?\" he asked, in the\ntone of one who knows the answer.\n\n\"Oh _please_ in the garden!\" cried Lady Beach-Mandarin. \"Please! And how\ndelightful to _have_ a garden, a London garden, in which one _can_ have\ntea. Without being smothered in blacks. The south-west wind. The dear\n_English_ wind. All your blacks come to _us_, you know.\"\n\nShe led the way upon the verandah. \"Such a wonderful garden! The space,\nthe breadth! Why! you must have Acres!\"\n\nShe surveyed the garden--comprehensively; her eye rested for a moment on\na distant patch of black that ducked suddenly into a group of lilacs.\n\"Is dear Sir Isaac at home?\" she asked.\n\n\"He's very uncertain,\" said Lady Harman, with a quiet readiness that\npleased Mr. Brumley. \"Yes, Snagsby, please, under the big cypress. And\ntell my mother and sister.\"\n\nLady Beach-Mandarin having paused a moment or so upon the verandah\nadmiring the garden as a whole, now prepared to go into details. She\ngathered her ample skirts together and advanced into the midst of the\nlarge lawn, with very much of the effect of a fleet of captive balloons\ndragging their anchors. Mr. Brumley followed, as it were in attendance\nupon her and Lady Harman. Miss Sharsper, after one last hasty glance at\nthe room, rather like the last hasty glance of a still unprepared\nschoolboy at his book, came behind with her powers of observation\nstrainingly alert.\n\nMr. Brumley was aware of a brief mute struggle between the two ladies of\ntitle. It was clear that Lady Harman would have had them go to the left,\nto where down a vista of pillar roses a single large specimen cypress\nsounded a faint but recognizable Italian note, and he did his loyal best\nto support her, but Lady Beach-Mandarin's attraction to that distant\nclump of lilac on the right was equally great and much more powerful.\nShe flowed, a great and audible tide of socially influential womanhood,\nacross the green spaces of the garden, and drew the others with her. And\nit seemed to Mr. Brumley--not that he believed his eyes--that beyond\nthose lilacs something ran out, something black that crouched close to\nthe ground and went very swiftly. It flashed like an arrow across a\nfurther space of flower-bed, dropped to the ground, became two\nagitatedly receding boot soles and was gone. Had it ever been? He\nglanced at Lady Harman, but she was looking back with the na\u00c3\u00afve anxiety\nof a hostess to her cypress,--at Lady Beach-Mandarin, but she was\nproliferating compliments and decorative scrolls and flourishes like the\nengraved frontispiece to a seventeenth-century book.\n\n\"I know I'm inordinately curious,\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin, \"but\ngardens are my Joy. I want to go into every corner of this. Peep into\neverything. And I feel somehow\"--and here she urged a smile on Lady\nHarman's attention--\"that I shan't begin to know _you_, until I know all\nyour environment.\"\n\nShe turned the flank of the lilacs as she said these words and advanced\nin echelon with a stately swiftness upon the laurels beyond.\n\nLady Harman said there was nothing beyond but sycamores and the fence,\nbut Lady Beach-Mandarin would press on through a narrow path that\npierced the laurel hedge, in order, she said, that she might turn back\nand get the whole effect of the grounds.\n\nAnd so it was they discovered the mushroom shed.\n\n\"A mushroom shed!\" cried Lady Beach-Mandarin. \"And if we look in--shall\nwe see hosts and regiments of mushrooms? I must--I must.\"\n\n\"I _think_ it is locked,\" said Lady Harman.\n\nMr. Brumley darted forward; tried the door and turned quickly. \"It's\nlocked,\" he said and barred Lady Beach-Mandarin's advance.\n\n\"And besides,\" said Lady Harman, \"there's no mushrooms there. They won't\ncome up. It's one of my husband's--annoyances.\"\n\nLady Beach-Mandarin had turned round and now surveyed the house. \"What a\nsplendid idea,\" she cried, \"that wistaria! All mixed with the laburnum.\nI don't think I have ever seen such a charming combination of blossoms!\"\n\nThe whole movement of the party swept about and faced cypress-ward. Away\nthere the sandy-whiskered butler and a footman and basket chairs and a\ntea-table, with a shining white cloth, and two ladies were now grouping\nthemselves....\n\nBut the mind of Mr. Brumley gave little heed to these things. His mind\nwas full of a wonder, and the wonder was this, that the mushroom shed\nhad behaved like a living thing. The door of the mushroom shed was not\nlocked and in that matter he had told a lie. The door of the mushroom\nshed had been unlocked quite recently and the key and padlock had been\ndropped upon the ground. And when he had tried to open the mushroom shed\nit had first of all yielded to his hand and then it had closed again\nwith great strength--exactly as a living mussel will behave if one takes\nit unawares. But in addition to this passionate contraction the mushroom\nshed had sworn in a hoarse whisper and breathed hard, which is more than\nyour mussel can do....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a73\n\nMr. Brumley's interest in Lady Harman was to be almost too crowded by\ndetail before that impulsive call was over. Superposed upon the mystery\nof the mushroom shed was the vivid illumination of Lady Harman by her\nmother and sister. They had an effect of having reluctantly become her\nsocial inferiors for her own good; the mother--her name he learnt was\nMrs. Sawbridge--had all Lady Harman's tall slenderness, but otherwise\nresembled her only in the poise of her neck and an occasional gesture;\nshe was fair and with a kind of ignoble and premeditated refinement in\nher speech and manner. She was dressed with the restraint of a prolonged\nand attenuated widowhood, in a rich and complicatedly quiet dress of\nmauve and grey. She was obviously a transitory visitor and not so much\ntaking the opulence about her and particularly the great butler for\ngranted as pointedly and persistently ignoring it in an effort to seem\nto take it for granted. The sister, on the other hand, had Lady Harman's\npale darkness but none of her fineness of line. She missed altogether\nthat quality of fineness. Her darkness was done with a quite perceptible\nheaviness, her dignity passed into solidity and her profile was, with an\nentire want of hesitation, handsome. She was evidently the elder by a\nspace of some years and she was dressed with severity in grey.\n\nThese two ladies seemed to Mr. Brumley to offer a certain resistance of\nspirit to the effusion of Lady Beach-Mandarin, rather as two small\nanchored vessels might resist the onset of a great and foaming tide, but\nafter a time it was clear they admired her greatly. His attention was,\nhowever, a little distracted from them by the fact that he was the sole\nrepresentative of the more serviceable sex among five women and so in\nduty bound to stand by Lady Harman and assist with various handings and\nofferings. The tea equipage was silver and not only magnificent but, as\ncertain quick movements of Miss Sharsper's eyes and nose at its\nappearance betrayed, very genuine and old.\n\nLady Beach-Mandarin having praised the house and garden all over again\nto Mrs. Sawbridge, and having praised the cypress and envied the tea\nthings, resumed her efforts to secure the immediate establishment of\npermanent social relations with Lady Harman. She reverted to the\nquestion of the Shakespear Dinners Society and now with a kind of large\nskilfulness involved Mrs. Sawbridge in her appeal. \"Won't _you_ come on\nour Committee?\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin.\n\nMrs. Sawbridge gave a pinched smile and said she was only staying in\nLondon for quite a little time, and when pressed admitted that there\nseemed no need whatever for consulting Sir Isaac upon so obviously\nforegone a conclusion as Lady Harman's public adhesion to the great\nmovement.\n\n\"I shall put his hundred guineas down to Sir Isaac and Lady Harman,\"\nsaid Lady Beach-Mandarin with an air of conclusion, \"and now I want to\nknow, dear Lady Harman, whether we can't have _you_ on our Committee of\nadministration. We want--just one other woman to complete us.\"\n\nLady Harman could only parry with doubts of her ability.\n\n\"You ought to go on, Ella,\" said Miss Sawbridge suddenly, speaking for\nthe first time and in a manner richly suggestive of great principles at\nstake.\n\n\"Ella,\" thought the curious mind of Mr. Brumley. \"And is that Eleanor\nnow or Ellen or--is there any other name that gives one Ella? Simply\nElla?\"\n\n\"But what should I have to do?\" fenced Lady Harman, resisting but\nobviously attracted.\n\nLady Beach-Mandarin invented a lengthy paraphrase for prompt\nacquiescences.\n\n\"I shall be chairwoman,\" she crowned it with. \"I can so easily _see you\nthrough_ as they say.\"\n\n\"Ella doesn't go out half enough,\" said Miss Sawbridge suddenly to Miss\nSharsper, who was regarding her with furtive intensity--as if she was\nsurreptitiously counting her features.\n\nMiss Sharsper caught in mid observation started and collected her mind.\n\"One ought to go out,\" she said. \"Certainly.\"\n\n\"And independently,\" said Miss Sawbridge, with meaning.\n\n\"Oh independently!\" assented Miss Sharsper. It was evident she would now\nhave to watch her chance and begin counting all over again from the\nbeginning.\n\nMr. Brumley had an impression that Mrs. Sawbridge had said something\nquite confidential in his ear. He turned perplexed.\n\n\"Such charming weather,\" the lady repeated in the tone of one who\ndoesn't wish so pleasant a little secret to be too generally discussed.\n\n\"Never known a better summer,\" agreed Mr. Brumley.\n\nAnd then all these minor eddies were submerged in Lady Beach-Mandarin's\nadvance towards her next step, an invitation to lunch. \"There,\" said\nshe, \"I'm not Victorian. I always separate husbands and wives--by at\nleast a week. You must come alone.\"\n\nIt was clear to Mr. Brumley that Lady Harman wanted to come alone--and\nwas going to accept, and equally clear that she and her mother and\nsister regarded this as a very daring thing to do. And when that was\nsettled Lady Beach-Mandarin went on to the altogether easier topic of\nher Social Friends, a society of smart and influential women; who\ndevoted a certain fragment of time every week to befriending respectable\ngirls employed in London, in a briskly amiable manner, having them to\nspecial teas, having them to special evenings with special light\nrefreshments, knowing their names as far as possible and asking about\ntheir relations, and generally making them feel that Society was being\nvery frank and amiable to them and had an eye on them and meant them\nwell, and was better for them than socialism and radicalism and\nrevolutionary ideas. To this also Lady Harman it seemed was to come. It\nhad an effect to Mr. Brumley's imagination as if the painted scene of\nthat lady's life was suddenly bursting out into open doors--everywhere.\n\n\"Many of them are _quite_ lady-like,\" echoed Mrs. Sawbridge suddenly,\npicking up the whole thing instantly and speaking over her tea cup in\nthat quasi-confidential tone of hers to Mr. Brumley.\n\n\"Of course they are mostly quite dreadfully Sweated,\" said Lady\nBeach-Mandarin. \"Especially in the confectionery----\" She thought of her\nposition in time. \"In the inferior class of confectioners'\nestablishments,\" she said and then hurried on to: \"Of course when you\ncome to lunch,--Agatha Alimony. I'm most anxious for you and her to\nmeet.\"\n\n\"Is that _the_ Agatha Alimony?\" asked Miss Sawbridge abruptly.\n\n\"The one and only,\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin, flashing a smile at her.\n\"And what a marvel she is! I do so want you to know her, Lady Harman.\nShe'd be a Revelation to you....\"\n\nEverything had gone wonderfully so far. \"And now,\" said Lady\nBeach-Mandarin, thrusting forward a face of almost exaggerated\nmotherliness and with an unwonted tenderness suffusing her voice, \"show\nme the Chicks.\"\n\nThere was a brief interrogative pause.\n\n\"Your Chicks,\" expanded Lady Beach-Mandarin, on the verge of crooning.\n\"Your _little_ Chicks.\"\n\n\"_Oh!_\" cried Lady Harman understanding. \"The children.\"\n\n\"Lucky woman!\" cried Lady Beach-Mandarin. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"One hasn't begun to be friends,\" she added, \"until one has\nseen--them....\"\n\n\"So _true_,\" Mrs. Sawbridge confided to Mr. Brumley with a look that\nalmost languished....\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Mr. Brumley, \"rather.\"\n\nHe was a little distraught because he had just seen Sir Isaac step\nforward in a crouching attitude from beyond the edge of the lilacs, peer\nat the tea-table with a serpent-like intentness and then dart back\nconvulsively into cover....\n\nIf Lady Beach-Mandarin saw him Mr. Brumley felt that anything might\nhappen.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a74\n\nLady Beach-Mandarin always let herself go about children.\n\nIt would be unjust to the general richness of Lady Beach-Mandarin to say\nthat she excelled herself on this occasion. On all occasions Lady\nBeach-Mandarin excelled herself. But never had Mr. Brumley noted quite\nso vividly Lady Beach-Mandarin's habitual self-surpassingness. She\nhelped him, he felt, to understand better those stories of great waves\nthat sweep in from the ocean and swamp islands and devastate whole\nlittorals. She poured into the Harman nursery and filled every corner of\nit. She rose to unprecedented heights therein. It seemed to him at\nmoments that they ought to make marks on the walls, like the marks one\nsees on the houses in the lower valley of the Main to record the more\nmemorable floods. \"The dears!\" she cried: \"the _little_ things!\" before\nthe nursery door was fairly opened.\n\n(There should have been a line for that at once on the jamb just below\nthe lintel.)\n\nThe nursery revealed itself as a large airy white and green apartment\nentirely free from old furniture and done rather in the style of an\n\u00c3\u00a6sthetically designed hospital, with a tremendously humorous decorative\nfrieze of cocks and puppies and very bright-coloured prints on the\nwalls. The dwarfish furniture was specially designed in green-stained\nwood and the floor was of cork carpet diversified by white furry rugs.\nThe hospital quality was enhanced by the uniformed and disciplined\nappearance of the middle-aged and reliable head nurse and her subdued\nbut intelligent subordinate.\n\nThree sturdy little girls, with a year step between each of them, stood\nup to receive Lady Beach-Mandarin's invasion; an indeterminate baby\nsprawled regardless of its dignity on a rug. \"Aah!\" cried Lady\nBeach-Mandarin, advancing in open order. \"Come and be hugged, you dears!\nCome and be hugged!\" Before she knelt down and enveloped their shrinking\nlittle persons Mr. Brumley was able to observe that they were pretty\nlittle things, but not the beautiful children he could have imagined\nfrom Lady Harman. Peeping through their infantile delicacy, hints all\ntoo manifest of Sir Isaac's characteristically pointed nose gave Mr.\nBrumley a peculiar--a eugenic, qualm.\n\nHe glanced at Lady Harman and she was standing over the ecstasies of her\ntremendous visitor, polite, attentive--with an entirely unemotional\nspeculation in her eyes. Miss Sawbridge, stirred by the great waves of\nviolent philoprogenitive enthusiasm that circled out from Lady\nBeach-Mandarin, had caught up the baby and was hugging it and addressing\nit in terms of humorous rapture, and the nurse and her assistant were\nkeeping respectful but wary eyes upon the handling of their four\ncharges. Miss Sharsper was taking in the children's characteristics with\na quick expertness. Mrs. Sawbridge stood a little in the background and\ncaught Mr. Brumley's eye and proffered a smile of sympathetic tolerance.\n\nMr. Brumley was moved by a ridiculous impulse, which he just succeeded\nin suppressing, to say to Mrs. Sawbridge, \"Yes, I admit it looks very\nwell. But the essential point, you know, is that it isn't so....\"\n\nThat it wasn't so, indeed, entirely dominated his impression of that\nnursery. There was Lady Beach-Mandarin winning Lady Harman's heart by\nevery rule of the game, rejoicing effusively in those crowning triumphs\nof a woman's being, there was Miss Sawbridge vociferous in support and\nMrs. Sawbridge almost offering to join hands in rapturous benediction,\nand there was Lady Harman wearing her laurels, not indeed with\nindifference but with a curious detachment. One might imagine her\ngenuinely anxious to understand why Lady Beach-Mandarin was in such a\nstupendous ebullition. One might have supposed her a mere cold-hearted\nintellectual if it wasn't that something in her warm beauty absolutely\nforbade any such interpretation. There came to Mr. Brumley again a\nthought that had occurred to him first when Sir Isaac and Lady Harman\nhad come together to Black Strand, which was that life had happened to\nthis woman before she was ready for it, that her mind some years after\nher body was now coming to womanhood, was teeming with curiosity about\nall she had hitherto accepted, about Sir Isaac, about her children and\nall her circumstances....\n\nThere was a recapitulation of the invitations, a renewed offering of\noutlooks and vistas and Agatha Alimony. \"You'll not forget,\" insisted\nLady Beach-Mandarin. \"You'll not afterwards throw us over.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Lady Harman, with that soft determination of hers. \"I'll\ncertainly come.\"\n\n\"I'm so sorry, so very sorry, not to have seen Sir Isaac,\" Lady\nBeach-Mandarin insisted.\n\nThe raid had accomplished its every object and was drifting doorward.\nFor a moment Lady Beach-Mandarin desisted from Lady Harman and threw her\nwhole being into an eddying effort to submerge the already subjugated\nMrs. Sawbridge. Miss Sawbridge was behind up the oak staircase\nexplaining Sir Isaac's interest in furniture-buying to Miss Sharsper.\nMr. Brumley had his one moment with Lady Harman.\n\n\"I gather,\" he said, and abandoned that sentence.\n\n\"I hope,\" he said, \"that you will have my little house down there. I\nlike to think of _you_--walking in my garden.\"\n\n\"I shall love that garden,\" she said. \"But I shall feel unworthy.\"\n\n\"There are a hundred little things I want to tell you--about it.\"\n\nThen all the others seemed to come into focus again, and with a quick\nmutual understanding--Mr. Brumley was certain of its mutuality--they\nsaid no more to one another. He was entirely satisfied he had said\nenough. He had conveyed just everything that was needed to excuse and\nexplain and justify his presence in that company.... Upon a big table in\nthe hall he noticed that a silk hat and an umbrella had appeared since\ntheir arrival. He glanced at Miss Sharsper but she was keenly occupied\nwith the table legs. He began to breathe freely again when the partings\nwere over and he could get back into the automobile. \"Toot,\" said the\nhorn and he made a last grave salutation to the slender white figure on\nthe steps. The great butler stood at the side of the entrance and a step\nor so below her, with the air of a man who has completed a difficult\ntask. A small attentive valet hovered out of the shadows behind.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a75\n\n(A fragment of the conversation in Lady Beach-Mandarin's returning\nautomobile may be recorded in a parenthesis here.\n\n\"But did you see Sir Isaac?\" she cried, abruptly.\n\n\"Sir Isaac?\" defended the startled Mr. Brumley. \"Where?\"\n\n\"He was dodging about in the garden all the time.\"\n\n\"Dodging about the garden!... I saw a sort of gardener----\"\n\n\"I'm sure I saw Him,\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin. \"Positive. He hid away\nin the mushroom shed. The one you found locked.\"\n\n\"But my _dear_ Lady Beach-Mandarin!\" protested Mr. Brumley with the air\nof one who listens to preposterous suggestions. \"What can make you\nthink----?\"\n\n\"Oh I _know_ I saw him,\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin. \"I know. He seemed\nall over the place. Like a Boy Scout. Didn't you see him too, Susan?\"\n\nMiss Sharsper was roused from deep preoccupation. \"What, dear?\" she\nasked.\n\n\"See Sir Isaac?\"\n\n\"Sir Isaac?\"\n\n\"Dodging about the garden when we went through it.\"\n\nThe novelist reflected. \"I didn't notice,\" she said. \"I was busy\nobserving things.\")\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a76\n\nLady Beach-Mandarin's car passed through the open gates and was\nswallowed up in the dusty stream of traffic down Putney Hill; the great\nbutler withdrew, the little manservant vanished, Mrs. Sawbridge and her\nelder daughter had hovered and now receded from the back of the hall;\nLady Harman remained standing thoughtfully in the large\nBulwer-Lyttonesque doorway of her house. Her face expressed a vague\nexpectation. She waited to be addressed from behind.\n\nThen she became aware of the figure of her husband standing before her.\nHe had come out of the laurels in front. His pale face was livid with\nanger, his hair dishevelled, there was garden mould and greenness upon\nhis knees and upon his extended hands.\n\nShe was startled out of her quiet defensiveness. \"Why, Isaac!\" she\ncried. \"Where have you been?\"\n\nIt enraged him further to be asked so obviously unnecessary a question.\nHe forgot his knightly chivalry.\n\n\"What the Devil do you mean,\" he cried, \"by chasing me all round the\ngarden?\"\n\n\"Chasing you? All round the garden?\"\n\n\"You heard me breaking my shins on that infernal flower-pot you put for\nme, and out you shot with all your pack of old women and chased me round\nthe garden. What do you mean by it?\"\n\n\"I didn't think you were in the garden.\"\n\n\"Any Fool could have told I was in the garden. Any Fool might have known\nI was in the garden. If I wasn't in the garden, then where the Devil was\nI? Eh? Where else could I be? Of course I was in the garden, and what\nyou wanted was to hunt me down and make a fool of me. And look at me!\nLook, I say! Look at my hands!\"\n\nLady Harman regarded the lord of her being and hesitated before she\nanswered. She knew what she had to say would enrage him, but she had\ncome to a point in their relationship when a husband's good temper is no\nlonger a supreme consideration. \"You've had plenty of time to wash\nthem,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes,\" he shouted. \"And instead I kept 'em to show you. I stayed out\nhere to see the last of that crew for fear I might run against 'em in\nthe house. Of all the infernal old women----\"\n\nHis lips were providentially deprived of speech. He conveyed his\ninability to express his estimate of Lady Beach-Mandarin by a gesture of\ndespair.\n\n\"If--if anyone calls and I am at home I have to receive them,\" said Lady\nHarman, after a moment's deliberation.\n\n\"Receiving them's one thing. Making a Fool of yourself----\"\n\nHis voice was rising.\n\n\"Isaac,\" said Lady Harman, leaning forward and then in a low penetrating\nwhisper, \"_Snagsby!_\"\n\n(It was the name of the great butler.)\n\n\"_Damn_ Snagsby!\" hissed Sir Isaac, but dropping his voice and drawing\nnear to her. What his voice lost in height it gained in intensity. \"What\nI say is this, Ella, you oughtn't to have brought that old woman out\ninto the garden at all----\"\n\n\"She insisted on coming.\"\n\n\"You ought to have snubbed her. You ought to have done--anything. How\nthe Devil was I to get away, once she was through the verandah? There I\nwas! _Bagged!_\"\n\n\"You could have come forward.\"\n\n\"What! And meet _her_!\"\n\n\"_I_ had to meet her.\"\n\nSir Isaac felt that his rage was being frittered away upon details. \"If\nyou hadn't gone fooling about looking at houses,\" he said, and now he\nstood very close to her and spoke with a confidential intensity, \"you\nwouldn't have got that Holy Terror on our track, see? And now--here we\nare!\"\n\nHe walked past her into the hall, and the little manservant suddenly\nmaterialised in the middle of the space and came forward to brush him\nobsequiously. Lady Harman regarded that proceeding for some moments in a\npreoccupied manner and then passed slowly into the classical\nconservatory. She felt that in view of her engagements the discussion of\nLady Beach-Mandarin was only just beginning.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a77\n\nShe reopened it herself in the long drawing-room into which they both\ndrifted after Sir Isaac had washed the mould from his hands. She went to\na French window, gathered courage, it seemed, by a brief contemplation\nof the garden, and turned with a little effort.\n\n\"I don't agree,\" she said, \"with you about Lady Beach-Mandarin.\"\n\nSir Isaac appeared surprised. He had assumed the incident was closed.\n\"_How?_\" he asked compactly.\n\n\"I don't agree,\" said Lady Harman. \"She seems friendly and jolly.\"\n\n\"She's a Holy Terror,\" said Sir Isaac. \"I've seen her twice, Lady\nHarman.\"\n\n\"A call of that kind,\" his wife went on, \"--when there are cards left\nand so on--has to be returned.\"\n\n\"You won't,\" said Sir Isaac.\n\nLady Harman took a blind-tassel in her hand,--she felt she had to hold\non to something. \"In any case,\" she said, \"I should have to do that.\"\n\n\"In any case?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"It would be ridiculous not to. We----It is why we know so\nfew people--because we don't return calls....\"\n\nSir Isaac paused before answering. \"We don't _want_ to know a lot of\npeople,\" he said. \"And, besides----Why! anybody could make us go running\nabout all over London calling on them, by just coming and calling on us.\nNo sense in it. She's come and she's gone, and there's an end of it.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Lady Harman, gripping her tassel more firmly. \"I shall have\nto return that call.\"\n\n\"I tell you, you won't.\"\n\n\"It isn't only a call,\" said Lady Harman. \"You see, I promised to go\nthere to lunch.\"\n\n\"Lunch!\"\n\n\"And to go to a meeting with her.\"\n\n\"Go to a meeting!\"\n\n\"--of a society called the Social Friends. And something else. Oh! to go\nto the committee meetings of her Shakespear Dinners Movement.\"\n\n\"I've heard of that.\"\n\n\"She said you supported it--or else of course....\"\n\nSir Isaac restrained himself with difficulty.\n\n\"Well,\" he said at last, \"you'd better write and tell her you can't do\nany of these things; that's all.\"\n\nHe thrust his hands into his trousers pockets and walked to the French\nwindow next to the one in which she stood, with an air of having settled\nthis business completely, and being now free for the tranquil\ncontemplation of horticulture. But Lady Harman had still something to\nsay.\n\n\"I am going to _all_ these things,\" she said. \"I said I would, and I\nwill.\"\n\nHe didn't seem immediately to hear her. He made the little noise with\nhis teeth that was habitual to him. Then he came towards her. \"This is\nyour infernal sister,\" he said.\n\nLady Harman reflected. \"No,\" she decided. \"It's myself.\"\n\n\"I might have known when we asked her here,\" said Sir Isaac with an\nhabitual disregard of her judgments that was beginning to irritate her\nmore and more. \"You can't take on all these people. They're not the sort\nof people we want to know.\"\n\n\"I want to know them,\" said Lady Harman.\n\n\"I don't.\"\n\n\"I find them interesting,\" Lady Harman said. \"And I've promised.\"\n\n\"Well you oughtn't to have promised without consulting me.\"\n\nHer reply was the material of much subsequent reflection on the part of\nSir Isaac. There was something in her manner....\n\n\"You see, Isaac,\" she said, \"you kept so out of the way....\"\n\nIn the pause that followed her words, Mrs. Sawbridge appeared from the\ngarden smiling with a determined amiability, and bearing a great bunch\nof the best roses (which Sir Isaac hated to have picked) in her hands.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FOURTH\n\nTHE BEGINNINGS OF LADY HARMAN\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a71\n\nLady Harman had been married when she was just eighteen.\n\nMrs. Sawbridge was the widow of a solicitor who had been killed in a\nrailway collision while his affairs, as she put it, were unsettled; and\nshe had brought up her two daughters in a villa at Penge upon very\nlittle money, in a state of genteel protest. Ellen was the younger. She\nhad been a sturdy dark-eyed doll-dragging little thing and had then shot\nup very rapidly. She had gone to a boarding-school at Wimbledon because\nMrs. Sawbridge thought the Penge day-school had made Georgina opiniated\nand unladylike, besides developing her muscular system to an unrefined\ndegree. The Wimbledon school was on less progressive lines, and anyhow\nEllen grew taller and more feminine than her sister and by seventeen was\nalready womanly, dignified and intensely admired by a number of\nschoolmates and a large circle of their cousins and brothers. She was\ngenerally very good and only now and then broke out with a venturesome\nenterprise that hurt nobody. She got out of a skylight, for example,\nand perambulated the roof in the moonshine to see how it felt and did\none or two other little things of a similar kind. Otherwise her conduct\nwas admirable and her temper in those days was always contagiously good.\nThat attractiveness which Mr. Brumley felt, was already very manifest,\nand a little hindered her in the attainment of other distinctions. Most\nof her lessons were done for her by willing slaves, and they were happy\nslaves because she abounded in rewarding kindnesses; but on the other\nhand the study of English literature and music was almost forced upon\nher by the zeal of the two visiting Professors of these subjects.\n\nAnd at seventeen, which is the age when girls most despise the\nboyishness of young men, she met Sir Isaac and filled him with an\ninvincible covetousness....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a72\n\nThe school at Wimbledon was a large, hushed, faded place presided over\nby a lady of hidden motives and great exterior calm named Miss Beeton\nClavier. She was handsome without any improper attractiveness, an\nAssociate in Arts of St. Andrew's University and a cousin of Mr. Blenker\nof the _Old Country Gazette_. She was assisted by several resident\nmistresses and two very carefully married visiting masters for music and\nShakespear, and playground and shrubbery and tennis-lawn were all quite\neffectively hidden from the high-road. The curriculum included Latin\nGrammar--nobody ever got to the reading of books in that formidable\ntongue--French by an English lady who had been in France, Hanoverian\nGerman by an irascible native, the more seemly aspects of English\nhistory and literature, arithmetic, algebra, political economy and\ndrawing. There was no hockey played within the precincts, science was\ntaught without the clumsy apparatus or objectionable diagrams that are\nnow so common, and stress was laid upon the carriage of the young ladies\nand the iniquity of speaking in raised voices. Miss Beeton Clavier\ndeprecated the modern \"craze for examinations,\" and released from such\npressure her staff did not so much give courses of lessons as circle in\na thorough-looking and patient manner about their subjects. This\nturn-spit quality was reflected in the school idiom; one did not learn\nalgebra or Latin or so-forth, one _did_ algebra, one was _put into_\nLatin....\n\nThe girls went through this system of exercises and occupations,\nevasively and as it were _sotto voce_, making friends, making enemies,\nmaking love to one another, following instincts that urged them to find\nout something about life--in spite of the most earnest discouragement....\nNone of them believed for a moment that the school was preparing them for\nlife. Most of them regarded it as a long inexplicable passage of blank,\ngrey occupations through which they had to pass. Beyond was the sunshine.\n\nEllen gathered what came to her. She realized a certain beauty in music\nin spite of the biographies of great musicians, the technical\nenthusiasms and the general professionalism of her teacher; the\nliterature master directed her attention to memoirs and through these\nshe caught gleams of understanding when the characters of history did\nfor brief intervals cease to be rigidly dignified and institutional like\nMiss Beeton Clavier and became human--like schoolfellows. And one little\nspectacled mistress, who wore art dresses and adorned her class-room\nwith flowers, took a great fancy to her, talked to her with much\nvagueness and emotion of High Aims, and lent her with an impressive\nfurtiveness the works of Emerson and Shelley and a pamphlet by Bernard\nShaw. It was a little difficult to understand what these writers were\ndriving at, they were so dreadfully clever, but it was clear they\nreflected criticism upon the silences of her mother and the rigidities\nof Miss Beeton Clavier.\n\nIn that suppressed and evasive life beneath the outer forms and\nprocedures of school and home, there came glimmerings of something that\nseemed charged with the promise of holding everything together, the key,\nreligion. She was attracted to religion, much more attracted than she\nwould confess even to herself, but every circumstance in her training\ndissuaded her from a free approach. Her mother treated religion with a\nreverence that was almost indistinguishable from huffiness. She never\nnamed the deity and she did not like the mention of His name: she threw\na spell of indelicacy over religious topics that Ellen never thoroughly\ncast off. She put God among objectionable topics--albeit a sublime one.\nMiss Beeton Clavier sustained this remarkable suggestion. When she read\nprayers in school she did so with the balanced impartiality of one who\noffers no comment. She seemed pained as she read and finished with a\nsigh. Whatever she intended to convey, she conveyed that even if the\ndivinity was not all He should be, if, indeed, He was a person almost\nprimitive, having neither the restraint nor the self-obliteration of a\nrefined gentlewoman, no word of it should ever pass her lips. And so\nEllen as a girl never let her mind go quite easily into this reconciling\ncore of life, and talked of it only very rarely and shyly with a few\nchosen coevals. It wasn't very profitable talk. They had a guilty\nfeeling, they laughed a little uneasily, they displayed a fatal\nproclivity to stab the swelling gravity of their souls with some forced\nand silly jest and so tumble back to ground again before they rose too\nhigh....\n\nYet great possibilities of faith and devotion stirred already in the\ngirl's heart. She thought little of God by day, but had a strange sense\nof Him in the starlight; never under the moonlight--that was in no sense\ndivine--but in the stirring darkness of the stars. And it is remarkable\nthat after a course of astronomical enlightenment by a visiting master\nand descriptions of masses and distances, incredible aching distances,\nthen even more than ever she seemed to feel God among the stars....\n\nA fatal accident to a schoolfellow turned her mind for a time to the\ndark stillnesses of death. The accident happened away in Wales during\nthe summer holidays; she saw nothing of it, she only knew of its\nconsequence. Hitherto she had assumed it was the function of girls to\ngrow up and go out from the grey intermediate state of school work into\nfreedoms and realities beyond. Death happened, she was aware, to young\npeople, but not she had thought to the people one knew. This termination\ncame with a shock. The girl was no great personal loss to Ellen, they\nhad belonged to different sets and classes, but the conception of her as\nlying very very still for ever was a haunting one. Ellen felt she did\nnot want to be still for evermore in a confined space, with life and\nsunshine going on all about her and above her, and it quickened her\ngrowing appetite for living to think that she might presently have to be\nlike that. How stifled one would feel!\n\nIt couldn't be like that.\n\nShe began to speculate about that future life upon which religion\ninsists so much and communicates so little. Was it perhaps in other\nplanets, under those wonderful, many-mooned, silver-banded skies? She\nperceived more and more a kind of absurdity in the existence all about\nher. Was all this world a mere make-believe, and would Miss Beeton\nClavier and every one about her presently cast aside a veil? Manifestly\nthere was a veil. She had a very natural disposition to doubt whether\nthe actual circumstances of her life were real. Her mother for instance\nwas so lacking in blood and fire, so very like the stiff paper wrapping\nof something else. But if these things were not real, what was real?\nWhat might she not presently do? What might she not presently be?\nPerhaps death had something to do with that. Was death perhaps no more\nthan the flinging off of grotesque outer garments by the newly arrived\nguests at the feast of living? She had that feeling that there might be\na feast of living.\n\nThese preoccupations were a jealously guarded secret, but they gave her\na quality of slight detachment that added a dreaming dignity to her dark\ntall charm.\n\nThere were moments of fine, deep excitement that somehow linked\nthemselves in her mind with these thoughts as being set over against the\nthings of every day. These too were moments quite different and separate\nin quality from delight, from the keen appreciation of flowers or\nsunshine or little vividly living things. Daylight seemed to blind her\nto them, as they blinded her to starshine. They too had a quality of\nreference to things large and remote, distances, unknown mysteries of\nlight and matter, the thought of mountains, cool white wildernesses and\ndriving snowstorms, or great periods of time. Such were the luminous\ntransfigurations that would come to her at the evening service in\nchurch.\n\nThe school used to sit in the gallery over against the organist, and for\na year and more Ellen had the place at the corner from which she could\nlook down the hazy candle-lit vista of the nave and see the\ncongregation as ranks and ranks of dim faces and vaguely apprehended\nclothes, ranks that rose with a peculiar deep and spacious rustle to\nsing, and sang with a massiveness of effect she knew in no other music.\nCertain hymns in particular seemed to bear her up and carry her into\nanother larger, more wonderful world: \"Heart's Abode, Celestial Salem\"\nfor example, a world of luminous spiritualized sensuousness. Of such a\nquality she thought the Heavenly City must surely be, away there and\naway. But this persuasion differed from those other mystical intimations\nin its detachment from any sense of the divinity. And remarkably mixed\nup with it and yet not belonging to it, antagonistic and kindred like a\nsilver dagger stuck through a mystically illuminated parchment, was the\nangelic figure of a tall fair boy in a surplice who stood out amidst the\nchoir below and sang, it seemed to her, alone.\n\nShe herself on these occasions of exaltation would be far too deeply\nmoved to sing. She was inundated by a swimming sense of boundaries\nnearly transcended, as though she was upon the threshold of a different\nlife altogether, the real enduring life, and as though if she could only\nmaintain herself long enough in this shimmering exaltation she would get\nright over; things would happen, things that would draw her into that\nmusic and magic and prevent her ever returning to everyday life again.\nThere one would walk through music between great candles under eternal\nstars, hand-in-hand with a tall white figure. But nothing ever did\nhappen to make her cross that boundary; the hymn ceased, the \"Amen\"\ndied away, as if a curtain fell. The congregation subsided. Reluctantly\nshe would sink back into her seat....\n\nBut all through the sermon, to which she never gave the slightest\nattention, her mind would feel mute and stilled, and she used to come\nout of church silent and preoccupied, returning unwillingly to the\ncommonplaces of life....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a73\n\nEllen met Sir Isaac--in the days before he was Sir Isaac--at the house\nof a school friend with whom she was staying at Hythe, and afterwards\nher mother and sister came down and joined her for a fortnight at a\nFolkstone boarding house. Mr. Harman had caught a chill while inspecting\nhis North Wales branches and had come down with his mother to\nrecuperate. He and his mother occupied a suite of rooms in the most\nimposing hotel upon the Leas. Ellen's friend's people were partners in a\nbig flour firm and had a pleasant new \u00c3\u00a6sthetic white and green house of\nrough-cast and slates in the pretty country beyond the Hythe golf links,\nand Ellen's friend's father was deeply anxious to develop amiable\narrangements with Mr. Harman. There was much tennis, much croquet, much\ncycling to the Hythe sea-wall and bathing from little tents and sitting\nabout in the sunshine, and Mr. Harman had his first automobile with\nhim--they were still something of a novelty in those days--and was\nurgent to take picnic parties to large lonely places on the downs.\n\nThere were only two young men in that circle, one was engaged to Ellen's\nfriend's sister, and the other was bound to a young woman remote in\nItaly; neither was strikingly attractive and both regarded Harman with\nthat awe tempered by undignified furtive derision which wealth and\nbusiness capacity so often inspire in the young male. At first he was\nquiet and simply looked at her, as it seemed any one might look, then\nshe perceived he looked at her intently and continuously, and was\npersistently close to her and seemed always to be trying to do things to\nplease her and attract her attention. And then from the general\nbehaviour of the women about her, her mother and Mrs. Harman and her\nfriend's mother and her friend's sister, rather than from any one\nspecific thing they said, it grew upon her consciousness that this\nimportant and fabulously wealthy person, who was also it seemed to her\nso modest and quiet and touchingly benevolent, was in love with her.\n\n\"Your daughter,\" said Mrs. Harman repeatedly to Mrs. Sawbridge, \"is\ncharming, perfectly charming.\"\n\n\"She's _such_ a child,\" said Mrs. Sawbridge repeatedly in reply.\n\nAnd she told Ellen's friend's mother apropos of Ellen's friend's\nengagement that she wanted all her daughters to marry for love, she\ndidn't care what the man had so long as they loved each other, and\nmeanwhile she took the utmost care that Isaac had undisputed access to\nthe girl, was watchfully ready to fend off anyone else, made her take\neverything he offered and praised him quietly and steadily to her. She\npointed out how modest and unassuming he was, in spite of the fact that\nhe was \"controlling an immense business\" and in his own particular trade\n\"a perfect Napoleon.\"\n\n\"For all one sees to the contrary he might be just a private gentleman.\nAnd he feeds thousands and thousands of people....\"\n\n\"Sooner or later,\" said Mrs. Harman, \"I suppose Isaac will marry. He's\nbeen such a good son to me that I shall feel it dreadfully, and yet, you\nknow, I wish I could see him settled. Then _I_ shall settle--in a little\nhouse of my own somewhere. Just a little place. I don't believe in\ncoming too much between son and daughter-in-law....\"\n\nHarman's natural avidity was tempered by a proper modesty. He thought\nEllen so lovely and so infinitely desirable--and indeed she was--that it\nseemed incredible to him that he could ever get her. And yet he had got\nmost of the things in life he had really and urgently wanted. His doubts\ngave his love-making an eager, lavish and pathetic delicacy. He watched\nher minutely in an agony of appreciation. He felt ready to give or\npromise anything.\n\nShe was greatly flattered by his devotion and she liked the surprises\nand presents he heaped upon her extremely. Also she was sorry for him\nbeyond measure. In the deep recesses of her heart was an oleographic\nideal of a large brave young man with blue eyes, a wave in his fair\nhair, a wonderful tenor voice and--she could not help it, she tried to\nlook away and not think of it--a broad chest. With him she intended to\nclimb mountains. So clearly she could not marry Mr. Harman. And because\nof that she tried to be very kind indeed to him, and when he faltered\nthat she could not possibly care for him, she reassured him so vaguely\nas to fill him with wild gusts of hope and herself with a sense of\npledges. He told her one day between two sets of tennis--which he played\nwith a certain tricky skill--that he felt that the very highest\nhappiness he could ever attain would be to die at her feet. Presently\nher pity and her sense of responsibility had become so large and deep\nthat the dream hero with the blue eyes was largely overlaid and hidden\nby them.\n\nThen, at first a little indirectly and then urgently and with a voice\nupon the edge of tears, Harman implored her to marry him. She had never\nbefore in the whole course of her life seen a grown-up person on the\nvery verge of tears. She felt that the release of such deep fountains as\nthat must be averted at any cost. She felt that for a mere schoolgirl\nlike herself, a backward schoolgirl who had never really mastered\nquadratics, to cause these immense and tragic distresses was abominable.\nShe was sure her former headmistress would disapprove very highly of\nher. \"I will make you a queen,\" said Harman, \"I will give all my life to\nyour happiness.\"\n\nShe believed he would.\n\nShe refused him for the second time but with a weakening certainty in a\nlittle white summer-house that gave a glimpse of the sea between green\nand wooded hills. She sat and stared at the sea after he had left her,\nthrough a mist of tears; so pitiful did he seem. He had beaten his poor\nfists on the stone table and then caught up her hand, kissed it and\nrushed out.... She had not dreamt that love could hurt like that.\n\nAnd all that night--that is to say for a full hour before her wet\neyelashes closed in slumber--she was sleepless with remorse for the\nmisery she was causing him.\n\nThe third time when he said with suicidal conviction that he could not\nlive without her, she burst into tears of pity and yielded. And\ninstantly, amazingly, with the famished swiftness of a springing panther\nhe caught her body into his arms and kissed her on the lips....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a74\n\nThey were married with every circumstance of splendour, with very\nexpensive music, and portraits in the illustrated newspapers and a great\nglitter of favours and carriages. The bridegroom was most thoughtful and\ngenerous about the Sawbridge side of the preparations. Only one thing\nwas a little perplexing. In spite of his impassioned impatience he\ndelayed the wedding. Full of dark hints and a portentous secret, he\ndelayed the wedding for twenty-five whole days in order that it should\nfollow immediately upon the publication of the birthday honours list.\nAnd then they understood.\n\n\"You will be Lady Harman,\" he exulted; \"_Lady_ Harman. I would have\ngiven double.... I have had to back the _Old Country Gazette_ and I\ndon't care a rap. I'd have done anything. I'd have bought the rotten\nthing outright.... Lady Harman!\"\n\nHe remained loverlike until the very eve of their marriage. Then\nsuddenly it seemed to her that all the people she cared for in the world\nwere pushing her away from them towards him, giving her up, handing her\nover. He became--possessive. His abjection changed to pride. She\nperceived that she was going to be left tremendously alone with him,\nwith an effect, as if she had stepped off a terrace on to what she\nbelieved to be land and had abruptly descended into very deep water....\n\nAnd while she was still feeling quite surprised by everything and\nextremely doubtful whether she wanted to go any further with this\nbusiness, which was manifestly far more serious, out of all proportion\nmore serious, than anything that had ever happened to her before--and\n_unpleasant_, abounding indeed in crumpling indignities and horrible\nnervous stresses, it dawned upon her that she was presently to be that\nstrange, grown-up and preoccupied thing, a mother, and that girlhood and\nyouth and vigorous games, mountains and swimming and running and\nleaping were over for her as far as she could see for ever....\n\nBoth the prospective grandmothers became wonderfully kind and helpful\nand intimate, preparing with gusto and an agreeable sense of delegated\nresponsibility for the child that was to give them all the pride of\nmaternity again and none of its inconveniences.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FIFTH\n\nTHE WORLD ACCORDING TO SIR ISAAC\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a71\n\nHer marriage had carried Ellen out of the narrow world of home and\nschool into another that had seemed at first vastly larger, if only on\naccount of its freedom from the perpetual achievement of small\neconomies. Hitherto the urgent necessity of these had filled life with\nirksome precautions and clipped the wings of every dream. This new life\ninto which Sir Isaac led her by the hand promised not only that release\nbut more light, more colour, more movement, more people. There was to be\nat any rate so much in the way of rewards and compensation for her pity\nof him.\n\nShe found the establishment at Putney ready for her. Sir Isaac had not\nconsulted her about it, it had been his secret, he had prepared it for\nher with meticulous care as a surprise. They returned from a honeymoon\nin Skye in which the attentions of Sir Isaac and the comforts of a\nfirst-class hotel had obscured a marvellous background of sombre\nmountain and wide stretches of shining sea. Sir Isaac had been very fond\nand insistent and inseparable, and she was doing her best to conceal a\nstrange distressful jangling of her nerves which she now feared might\npresently dispose her to scream. Sir Isaac had been goodness itself, but\nhow she craved now for solitude! She was under the impression now that\nthey were going to his mother's house in Highbury. Then she thought he\nwould have to go away to business for part of the day at any rate, and\nshe could creep into some corner and begin to think of all that had\nhappened to her in these short summer months.\n\nThey were met at Euston by his motor-car. \"_Home_,\" said Sir Isaac, with\na little gleam of excitement, when the more immediate luggage was\naboard.\n\nAs they hummed through the West-End afternoon Ellen became aware that he\nwas whistling through his teeth. It was his invariable indication of\nmental activity, and her attention came drifting back from her idle\ncontemplation of the shoppers and strollers of Piccadilly to link this\nalready alarming symptom with the perplexing fact that they were\nmanifestly travelling west.\n\n\"But this,\" she said presently, \"is Knightsbridge.\"\n\n\"Goes to Kensington,\" he replied with attempted indifference.\n\n\"But your mother doesn't live this way.\"\n\n\"_We_ do,\" said Sir Isaac, shining at every point of his face.\n\n\"But,\" she halted. \"Isaac!--where are we going?\"\n\n\"Home,\" he said.\n\n\"You've not taken a house?\"\n\n\"Bought it.\"\n\n\"But,--it won't be ready!\"\n\n\"I've seen to that.\"\n\n\"Servants!\" she cried in dismay.\n\n\"That's all right.\" His face broke into an excited smile. His little\neyes danced and shone. \"Everything,\" he said.\n\n\"But the servants!\" she said.\n\n\"You'll see,\" he said. \"There's a butler--and everything.\"\n\n\"A butler!\" He could now no longer restrain himself. \"I was weeks,\" he\nsaid, \"getting it ready. Weeks and weeks.... It's a house.... I'd had my\neye on it before ever I met you. It's a real _good_ house, Elly....\"\n\nThe fortunate girl-wife went on through Brompton to Walham Green with a\nstunned feeling. So women have felt in tumbrils. A nightmare of butlers,\na galaxy of possible butlers, filled her soul.\n\nNo one was quite so big and formidable as Snagsby, towering up to\nreceive her, upon the steps of the home her husband was so amazingly\ngiving her.\n\nThe reader has already been privileged to see something of this house in\nthe company of Lady Beach-Mandarin. At the top of the steps stood Mrs.\nCrumble, the new and highly recommended cook-housekeeper in her best\nblack silk flounced and expanded, and behind her peeped several neat\nmaids in caps and aprons. A little valet-like under-butler appeared and\ntried to balance Snagsby by hovering two steps above him on the opposite\nside of the Victorian medi\u00c3\u00a6val porch.\n\nAssisted officiously by Snagsby and amidst the deferential unhelpful\ngestures of the under-butler, Sir Isaac handed his wife out of the car.\n\"Everything all right, Snagsby?\" he asked brusquely if a little\nbreathless.\n\n\"Everything in order, Sir Isaac.\"\n\n\"And here;--this is her ladyship.\"\n\n\"I 'ope her ladyship 'ad a pleasent journey to 'er new 'ome. I'm sure if\nI may presume, Sir Isaac, we shall all be very glad to serve her\nladyship.\"\n\n(Like all well-trained English servants, Snagsby always dropped as many\nh's as he could when conversing with his superiors. He did this as a\nmark of respect and to prevent social confusion, just as he was always\ncareful to wear a slightly misfitting dress coat and fold his trousers\nso that they creased at the sides and had a wide flat effect in front.)\n\nLady Harman bowed a little shyly to his good wishes and was then led up\nto Mrs. Crumble, in a stiff black silk, who curtseyed with a submissive\namiability to her new mistress. \"I'm sure, me lady,\" she said. \"I'm\nsure----\"\n\nThere was a little pause. \"Here they are, you see, right and ready,\"\nsaid Sir Isaac, and then with an inspiration, \"Got any tea for us,\nSnagsby?\"\n\nSnagsby addressing his mistress inquired if he should serve tea in the\ngarden or the drawing-room, and Sir Isaac decided for the garden.\n\n\"There's another hall beyond this,\" he said, and took his wife's arm,\nleaving Mrs. Crumble still bowing amiably before the hall table. And\nevery time she bowed she rustled richly....\n\n\"It's quite a big garden,\" said Sir Isaac.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a72\n\nAnd so the woman who had been a girl three weeks ago, this tall,\ndark-eyed, slightly perplexed and very young-looking lady, was\nintroduced to the home that had been made for her. She went about it\nwith an alarmed sense of strange responsibilities, not in the least\nfeeling that anything was being given to her. And Sir Isaac led her from\npoint to point full of the pride and joy of new possession--for it was\nhis first own house as well as hers--rejoicing over it and exacting\ngratitude.\n\n\"It's all right, isn't it?\" he asked looking up at her.\n\n\"It's wonderful. I'd no idea.\"\n\n\"See,\" he said, indicating a great brass bowl of perennial sunflowers on\nthe landing, \"your favourite flower!\"\n\n\"My favourite flower?\"\n\n\"You said it was--in that book. Perennial sunflower.\"\n\nShe was perplexed and then remembered.\n\nShe understood now why he had said downstairs, when she had glanced at a\nbig photographic enlargement of a portrait of Doctor Barnardo, \"your\nfavourite hero in real life.\"\n\nHe had brought her at Hythe one day a popular Victorian device, a\nconfession album, in which she had had to write down on a neat\nrose-tinted page, her favourite author, her favourite flower, her\nfavourite colour, her favourite hero in real life, her \"pet aversion,\"\nand quite a number of such particulars of her subjective existence. She\nhad filled this page in a haphazard manner late one night, and she was\ndisconcerted to find how thoroughly her careless replies had come home\nto roost. She had put down \"pink\" as her favourite colour because the\npage she was writing upon suggested it, and the paper of the room was\npale pink, the curtains strong pink with a pattern of paler pink and\ntied with large pink bows, and the lamp shades, the bedspread, the\npillow-cases, the carpet, the chairs, the very crockery--everything but\nthe omnipresent perennial sunflowers--was pink. Confronted with this\nrealization, she understood that pink was the least agreeable of all\npossible hues for a bedroom. She perceived she had to live now in a\nchromatic range between rather underdone mutton and salmon. She had said\nthat her favourite musical composers were Bach and Beethoven; she really\nmeant it, and a bust of Beethoven materialized that statement, but she\nhad made Doctor Barnardo her favourite hero in real life because his\nname also began with a B and she had heard someone say somewhere that he\nwas a very good man. The predominance of George Eliot's pensive rather\nthan delightful countenance in her bedroom and the array of all that\nlady's works in a lusciously tooled pink leather, was due to her equally\nreckless choice of a favourite author. She had said too that Nelson was\nher favourite historical character, but Sir Isaac with a delicate\njealousy had preferred to have this heroic but regrettably immoral\npersonality represented in his home only by an engraving of the Battle\nof Copenhagen....\n\nShe stood surveying this room, and her husband watched her eagerly. She\nwas, he felt, impressed at last!...\n\nCertainly she had never seen such a bedroom in her life. By comparison\neven with the largest of the hotel apartments they had occupied it was\nvast; it had writing-tables and a dainty bookcase and a blushing sofa,\nand dressing-tables and a bureau and a rose-red screen and three large\nwindows. Her thoughts went back to the narrow little bedroom at Penge\nwith which she had hitherto been so entirely content. Her own few little\nbooks, a photograph or so,--they'd never dare to come here, even if she\ndared to bring them.\n\n\"Here,\" said Sir Isaac, flinging open a white door, \"is your\ndressing-room.\"\n\nShe was chiefly aware of a huge white bath standing on a marble slab\nunder a window of crinkled pink-stained glass, and of a wide space of\ntiled floor with white fur rugs.\n\n\"And here,\" he said, opening a panel that was covered by wall paper, \"is\n_my_ door.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said to the question in her eyes, \"that's my room. You got\nthis one--for your own. It's how people do now. People of our\nposition.... There's no lock.\"\n\nHe shut the door slowly again and surveyed the splendours he had made\nwith infinite satisfaction.\n\n\"All right?\" he said, \"isn't it?\"... He turned to the pearl for which\nthe casket was made, and slipped an arm about her waist. His arm\ntightened.\n\n\"Got a kiss for me, Elly?\" he whispered.\n\nAt this moment, a gong almost worthy of Snagsby summoned them to tea. It\ncame booming in to them with a vast officious arrogance that brooked no\ndenial. It made one understand the imperatives of the Last Trump, albeit\nwith a greater dignity.... There was a little awkward pause.\n\n\"I'm so dirty and trainy,\" she said, disengaging herself from his arm.\n\"And we ought to go to tea.\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a73\n\nThe same exceptional aptitude of Sir Isaac for detailed administration\nthat had relieved his wife from the need of furnishing and arranging a\nhome, made the birth of her children and the organization of her nursery\nan almost detached affair for her. Sir Isaac went about in a preoccupied\nway, whistling between his teeth and planning with expert advice the\nequipment of an ideal nursery, and her mother and his mother became as\nit were voluminous clouds of uncommunicative wisdom and precaution. In\naddition the conversation of Miss Crump, the extremely skilled and\ncostly nurse, who arrived a full Advent before the child, fresh from the\nbirth of a viscount, did much to generalize whatever had remained\nindividual of this thing that was happening. With so much intelligence\nfocussed, there seemed to Lady Harman no particular reason why she\nshould not do her best to think as little as possible about the\nimpending affair, which meant for her, she now understood quite clearly,\nmore and more discomfort culminating in an agony. The summer promised to\nbe warm, and Sir Isaac took a furnished house for the great event in the\nhills behind Torquay. The maternal instinct is not a magic thing, it has\nto be evoked and developed, and I decline to believe it is indicative of\nany peculiar unwomanliness in Lady Harman that when at last she beheld\nher newly-born daughter in the hands of the experts, she moaned\ndruggishly, \"Oh! please take it away. Oh! Take it--away.\nAnywhere--anywhere.\"\n\nIt was very red and wrinkled and aged-looking and, except when it opened\nits mouth to cry, extraordinarily like its father. This resemblance\ndisappeared--along with a crop of darkish red hair--in the course of a\nday or two, but it left a lurking dislike to its proximity in her mind\nlong after it had become an entirely infantile and engaging baby.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a74\n\nThose early years of their marriage were the happiest period of Sir\nIsaac's life.\n\nHe seemed to have everything that man could desire. He was still only\njust forty at his marriage; he had made for himself a position\naltogether dominant in the world of confectionery and popular\nrefreshment, he had won a title, he had a home after his own heart, a\nbeautiful young wife, and presently delightful children in his own\nimage, and it was only after some years of contentment and serenity and\nwith a certain incredulity that he discovered that something in his\nwife, something almost in the nature of discontent with her lot, was\nundermining and threatening all the comfort and beauty of his life.\n\nSir Isaac was one of those men whom modern England delights to honour, a\nman of unpretentious acquisitiveness, devoted to business and distracted\nby no \u00c3\u00a6sthetic or intellectual interests. He was the only son of his\nmother, the widow of a bankrupt steam-miller, and he had been a delicate\nchild to rear. He left Mr. Gambard's college at Ealing after passing the\nsecond-class examination of the College of Preceptors at the age of\nsixteen, to go into a tea-office as clerk without a salary, a post he\npresently abandoned for a clerkship in the office of a large refreshment\ncatering firm. He attracted the attention of his employers by suggesting\nvarious administrative economies, and he was already drawing a salary of\ntwo hundred and fifty pounds a year when he was twenty-one. Many young\nmen would have rested satisfied with so rapid an advancement, and would\nhave devoted themselves to the amusements that are now considered so\npermissible to youth, but young Harman was made of sterner stuff, and it\nonly spurred him to further efforts. He contrived to save a\nconsiderable proportion of his salary for some years, and at the age of\ntwenty-seven he started, in association with a firm of flour millers,\nthe International Bread and Cake Stores, which spread rapidly over the\ncountry. They were not in any sense of the word \"International,\" but in\na search for inflated and inflating adjectives this word attracted him\nmost, and the success of the enterprise justified his choice. Originally\nconceived as a syndicated system of baker's shops running a specially\ngritty and nutritious line of bread, the Staminal Bread, in addition to\nthe ordinary descriptions, it rapidly developed a catering side, and in\na little time there were few centres of clerkly employment in London or\nthe Midlands where an International could not be found supplying the\nmidday scone or poached egg, washed down by a cup of tea, or coffee, or\nlemonade. It meant hard work for Isaac Harman. It drew lines on his\ncheeks, sharpened his always rather pointed nose to an extreme\nefficiency, greyed his hair, and gave an acquired firmness to his rather\nretreating mouth. All his time was given to the details of this\ndevelopment; always he was inspecting premises, selecting and dismissing\nmanagers, making codes of rules and fines for his growing army of\nemployees, organizing and reorganizing his central offices and his\ncentral bakeries, hunting up cheaper and cheaper supplies of eggs and\nflour, and milk and ham, devising advertisements and agency\ndevelopments. He had something of an artist's passion in these things;\nhe went about, a little bent and peaky, calculating and planning and\nhissing through his teeth, and feeling not only that he was getting on,\nbut that he was getting on in the most exemplary way. Manifestly,\nanybody in his line of business who wanted to be leisurely, or to be\ngenerous, who possessed any broader interests than the shop, who\ntroubled to think about the nation or the race or any of the deeper\nmysteries of life, was bound to go down before him. He dealt privately\nwith every appetite--until his marriage no human being could have\nsuspected him of any appetite but business--he disposed of every\ndistracting impulse with unobtrusive decision; and even his political\ninclination towards Radicalism sprang chiefly from an irritation with\nthe legal advantages of landlordism natural to a man who is frequently\nleasing shops.\n\nAt school Sir Isaac had not been a particularly prominent figure; his\ndisposition at cricket to block and to bowl \"sneaks\" and \"twisters\"\nunder-arm had raised his average rather than his reputation; he had\nevaded fights and dramatic situations, and protected himself upon\noccasions of unavoidable violence by punching with his white knuckles\nheld in a peculiar and vicious manner. He had always been a little\ninsensitive to those graces of style, in action if not in art, which\nappeal so strongly to the commoner sort of English mind; he played first\nfor safety, and that assured, for the uttermost advantage. These\ntendencies became more marked with maturity. When he took up tennis for\nhis health's sake he developed at once an ungracious service that had\nto be killed like vermin; he developed an instinct for the deadest ball\navailable, and his returns close up to the net were like assassinations.\nIndeed, he was inherently incapable of any vision beyond the express\nprohibitions and permissions of the rules of the games he played, or\nbeyond the laws and institutions under which he lived. His idea of\ngenerosity was the undocumented and unqualified purchase of a person by\npayments made in the form of a gift.\n\nAnd this being the quality of Sir Isaac's mind, it followed that his\ninterpretations of the relationship of marriage were simple and strict.\nA woman, he knew, had to be wooed to be won, but when she was won, she\nwas won. He did not understand wooing after that was settled. There was\nthe bargain and her surrender. He on his side had to keep her, dress\nher, be kind to her, give her the appearances of pride and authority,\nand in return he had his rights and his privileges and undefined powers\nof control. That you know, by the existing rules, is the reality of\nmarriage where there are no settlements and no private property of the\nwife's. That is to say, it is the reality of marriage in ninety-nine\ncases out of the hundred. And it would have shocked Sir Isaac extremely,\nand as a matter of fact it did shock him, for any one to suggest the\nslightest revision of so entirely advantageous an arrangement. He was\nconfident of his good intentions, and resolved to the best of his\nability to make his wife the happiest of living creatures, subject only\nto reasonable acquiescences and general good behaviour.\n\nNever before had he cared for anything so much as he did for her--not\neven for the International Bread and Cake Stores. He gloated upon her.\nShe distracted him from business. He resolved from the outset to\nsurround her with every luxury and permit her no desire that he had not\nalready anticipated. Even her mother and Georgina, whom he thought\nextremely unnecessary persons, were frequent visitors to his house. His\nsolicitude for her was so great that she found it difficult even to see\nher doctor except in his presence. And he bought her a pearl necklace\nthat cost six hundred pounds. He was, in fact, one of those complete\nhusbands who grow rare in these decadent days.\n\nThe social circle to which Sir Isaac introduced his wife was not a very\nextensive one. The business misadventures of his father had naturally\ndeprived his mother of most of her friends; he had made only\nacquaintances at school, and his subsequent concentration upon business\nhad permitted very few intimacies. Renewed prosperity had produced a\ncertain revival of cousins, but Mrs. Harman, established in a pleasant\nhouse at Highbury, had received their attentions with a well-merited\nstiffness. His chief associates were his various business allies, and\nthese and their wives and families formed the nucleus of the new world\nto which Ellen was gradually and temperately introduced. There were a\nfew local callers, but Putney is now too deeply merged with London for\nthis practice of the countryside to have any great effect upon a\nnew-comer's visiting circle.\n\nPerhaps Mr. Charterson might claim to be Sir Isaac's chief friend at the\ntime of that gentleman's marriage. Transactions in sugar had brought\nthem together originally. He was Sir Isaac's best man, and the new\nknight entertained a feeling of something very like admiration for him.\nMoreover, Mr. Charterson had very large ears, more particularly was the\nleft one large, extraordinarily large and projecting upper teeth, which\nhe sought vainly to hide beneath an extravagant moustache, and a harsh\nvoice, characteristics that did much to allay the anxieties natural to a\nnewly married man. Mr. Charterson was moreover adequately married to a\nlarge, attentive, enterprising, swarthy wife, and possessed a splendid\nhouse in Belgravia. Not quite so self-made as Sir Isaac, he was still\nsufficiently self-made to take a very keen interest in his own social\nadvancement and in social advancement generally, and it was through him\nthat Sir Isaac's attention had been first directed to those developing\nrelations with politics that arise as a business grows to greatness.\n\"I'm for Parliament,\" said Charterson. \"Sugar's in politics, and I'm\nafter it. You'd better come too, Harman. Those chaps up there, they'll\nplay jiggery-pokery with sugar if we aren't careful. And it won't be\nonly sugar, Harman!\"\n\nPressed to expand this latter sentence, he pointed out to his friend\nthat \"any amount of interfering with employment\" was in the air--\"any\namount.\"\n\n\"And besides,\" said Mr. Charterson, \"men like us have a stake in the\ncountry, Harman. We're getting biggish people. We ought to do our\nshare. I don't see the fun of leaving everything to the landlords and\nthe lawyers. Men of our sort have got to make ourselves felt. We want a\nbusiness government. Of course--one pays. So long as I get a voice in\ncalling the tune I don't mind paying the piper a bit. There's going to\nbe a lot of interference with trade. All this social legislation. And\nthere's what you were saying the other day about these leases....\"\n\n\"I'm not much of a talker,\" said Harman. \"I don't see myself gassing in\nthe House.\"\n\n\"Oh! I don't mean going into Parliament,\" said Charterson. \"That's for\nsome of us, perhaps.... But come into the party, make yourself felt.\"\n\nUnder Charterson's stimulation it was that Harman joined the National\nLiberal Club, and presently went on to the Climax, and through him he\ncame to know something of that inner traffic of arrangements and\nbargains which does so much to keep a great historical party together\nand maintain its vitality. For a time he was largely overshadowed by the\nsturdy Radicalism of Charterson, but presently as he understood this\ninteresting game better, he embarked upon a line of his own. Charterson\nwanted a seat, and presently got it; his maiden speech on the Sugar\nBounties won a compliment from Mr. Evesham; and Harman, who would have\npiloted a monoplane sooner than address the House, decided to be one of\nthose silent influences that work outside our national assembly. He came\nto the help of an embarrassed Liberal weekly, and then, in a Fleet\nStreet crisis, undertook the larger share of backing the _Old Country\nGazette_, that important social and intellectual party organ. His\nknighthood followed almost automatically.\n\nSuch political developments introduced a second element into the\nintermittent social relations of the Harman household. Before his\nknighthood and marriage Sir Isaac had participated in various public\nbanquets and private parties and little dinners in the vaults of the\nHouse and elsewhere, arising out of his political intentions, and with\nthe appearance of a Lady Harman there came a certain urgency on the part\nof those who maintain in a state of hectic dullness the social\nactivities of the great Liberal party. Horatio Blenker, Sir Isaac's\neditor, showed a disposition to be socially very helpful, and after Mrs.\nBlenker had called in a state of worldly instructiveness, there was a\nlittle dinner at the Blenkers' to introduce young Lady Harman to the\ngreat political world. It was the first dinner-party of her life, and\nshe found it dazzling rather than really agreeable.\n\nShe felt very slender and young and rather unclothed about the arms and\nneck, in spite of the six hundred pound pearl necklace that had been\ngiven to her just as she stood before the mirror in her white-and-gold\ndinner dress ready to start. She had to look down at that dress ever and\nagain and at her shining arms to remind herself that she wasn't still in\nschoolgirl clothes, and it seemed to her there was not another woman in\nthe room who was not fairly entitled to send her off to bed at any\nmoment. She had been a little nervous about the details of the dinner,\nbut there was nothing strange or difficult but caviare, and in that case\nshe waited for some one else to begin. The Chartersons were there, which\nwas very reassuring, and the abundant flowers on the table were a sort\nof protection. The man on her right was very nice, gently voluble, and\nevidently quite deaf, so that she had merely to make kind respectful\nfaces at him. He talked to her most of the time, and described the\npeasant costumes in Marken and Walcheren. And Mr. Blenker, with a fine\nappreciation of Sir Isaac's watchful temperament and his own magnetism,\nspoke to her three times and never looked at her once all through the\nentertainment.\n\nA few weeks later they went to dinner at the Chartersons', and then she\ngave a dinner, which was arranged very skilfully by Sir Isaac and\nSnagsby and the cook-housekeeper, with a little outside help, and then\ncame a big party reception at Lady Barleypound's, a multitudinous\nmiscellaneous assembly in which the obviously wealthy rubbed shoulders\nwith the obviously virtuous and the not quite so obviously clever. It\nwas a great orgy of standing about and seeing the various Blenkers and\nthe Cramptons and the Weston Massinghays and the Daytons and Mrs.\nMillingham with her quivering lorgnette and her last tame genius and\nLewis, and indeed all the Tapirs and Tadpoles of Liberalism, being\ntremendously active and influential and important throughout the\nevening. The house struck Ellen as being very splendid, the great\nstaircase particularly so, and never before had she seen a great\nmultitude of people in evening dress. Lady Barleypound in the golden\nparlour at the head of the stairs shook hands automatically, lest it\nwould seem in some amiable dream, Mrs. Blapton and a daughter rustled\nacross the gathering in a hasty vindictive manner and vanished, and a\nnumber of handsome, glittering, dark-eyed, splendidly dressed women kept\ntogether in groups and were tremendously but occultly amused. The\nvarious Blenkers seemed everywhere, Horatio in particular with his large\nfluent person and his luminous tenor was like a shop-walker taking\ncustomers to the departments: one felt he was weaving all these\nimmiscibles together into one great wise Liberal purpose, and that he\ndeserved quite wonderful things from the party; he even introduced five\nor six people to Lady Harman, looking sternly over her head and\nrestraining his charm as he did so on account of Sir Isaac's feelings.\nThe people he brought up to her were not very interesting people, she\nthought, but then that was perhaps due to her own dreadful ignorance of\npolitics.\n\nLady Harman ceased even to dip into the vortex of London society after\nMarch, and in June she went with her mother and a skilled nurse to that\nbeautiful furnished house Sir Isaac had found near Torquay, in\npreparation for the birth of their first little daughter.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a75\n\nIt seemed to her husband that it was both unreasonable and ungrateful of\nher to become a tearful young woman after their union, and for a phase\nof some months she certainly was a tearful young woman, but his mother\nmade it clear to him that this was quite a correct and permissible phase\nfor her, as she was, and so he expressed his impatience with temperance,\nand presently she was able to pull herself together and begin to\nreadjust herself to a universe that had seemed for a time almost too\nshattered for endurance. She resumed the process of growing up that her\nmarriage had for a time so vividly interrupted, and if her schooldays\nwere truncated and the college phase omitted, she had at any rate a very\nconsiderable amount of fundamental experience to replace these now\ncustomary completions.\n\nThree little girls she brought into the world in the first three years\nof her married life, then after a brief interval of indifferent health\nshe had a fourth girl baby of a physique quite obviously inferior to its\npredecessors, and then, after--and perhaps as a consequence of--much\nwhispered conversation of the two mothers-in-law, protests and tactful\nexplanation on the part of the elderly and trustworthy family doctor and\nremarks of an extraordinary breadth (and made at table too, almost\nbefore the door had closed on Snagsby!) from Ellen's elder sister, there\ncame a less reproductive phase....\n\nBut by that time Lady Harman had acquired the habit of reading and the\nhabit of thinking over what she read, and from that it is an easy step\nto thinking over oneself and the circumstances of one's own life. The\none thing trains for the other.\n\nNow the chief circumstance in the life of Lady Harman was Sir Isaac.\nIndeed as she grew to a clear consciousness of herself and her position,\nit seemed to her he was not so much a circumstance as a circumvallation.\nThere wasn't a direction in which she could turn without immediately\nrunning up against him. He had taken possession of her extremely. And\nfrom her first resignation to this as an inevitable fact she had come,\nshe hardly knew how, to a renewed disposition to regard this large and\nvarious universe beyond him and outside of him, with something of the\nsame slight adventurousness she had felt before he so comprehensively\nhappened to her. After her first phase of despair she had really done\nher best to honour the bargain she had rather unwittingly made and to\nlove and to devote herself and be a loyal and happy wife to this\nclutching, hard-breathing little man who had got her, and it was the\ninsatiable excesses of his demands quite as much as any outer influence\nthat made her realize the impossibility of such a concentration.\n\nHis was a supremely acquisitive and possessive character, so that he\ninsulted her utmost subjugations by an obtrusive suspicion and jealousy,\nhe was jealous of her childish worship of her dead father, jealous of\nher disposition to go to church, jealous of the poet Wordsworth because\nshe liked to read his sonnets, jealous because she loved great music,\njealous when she wanted to go out; if she seemed passionless and she\nseemed more and more passionless he was jealous, and the slightest gleam\nof any warmth of temperament filled him with a vile and furious dread of\ndishonouring possibilities. And the utmost resolution to believe in him\ncould not hide from her for ever the fact that his love manifested\nitself almost wholly as a parade of ownership and a desire, without\nkindliness, without any self-forgetfulness. All his devotion, his\nself-abjection, had been the mere qualms of a craving, the flush of\neager courtship. Do as she would to overcome these realizations, forces\nwithin her stronger than herself, primordial forces with the welfare of\nall life in their keeping, cried out upon the meanness of his face, the\nugly pointed nose and the thin compressed lips, the weak neck, the\nclammy hands, the ungainly nervous gestures, the tuneless whistling\nbetween the clenched teeth. He would not let her forget a single detail.\nWhenever she tried to look at any created thing, he thrust himself, like\none of his own open-air advertisements, athwart the attraction.\n\nAs she grew up to an achieved womanhood--and it was even a physical\ngrowing-up, for she added more than an inch of stature after her\nmarriage--her life became more and more consciously like a fencing match\nin which her vision flashed over his head and under his arms and this\nside of him and that, while with a toiling industry he fought to\nintercept it. And from the complete acceptance of her matrimonial\nsubmission, she passed on by almost insensible degrees towards a\nconception of her life as a struggle, that seemed at first entirely\nlonely and unsupported, to exist--_against_ him.\n\nIn every novel as in every picture there must be an immense\nsimplification, and so I tell the story of Lady Harman's changing\nattitude without any of those tangled leapings-forward or harkings-back,\nthose moods and counter moods and relapses which made up the necessary\ncourse of her mind. But sometimes she was here and sometimes she was\nthere, sometimes quite back to the beginning an obedient, scrupulously\nloyal and up-looking young wife, sometimes a wife concealing the\nhumiliation of an unhappy choice in a spurious satisfaction and\naffection. And mixed up with widening spaces of criticism and\ndissatisfaction and hostility there were, you must understand, moments\nof real liking for this outrageous little man and streaks of an absurd\nmaternal tenderness for him. They had been too close together to avoid\nthat. She had a woman's affection of ownership too, and disliked to see\nhim despised or bettered or untidy; even those ridiculous muddy hands\nhad given her a twinge of solicitude....\n\nAnd all the while she was trying to see the universe also, the great\nbackground of their two little lives, and to think what it might mean\nfor her over and above their too obliterating relationship.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a76\n\nIt would be like counting the bacteria of an infection to trace how\nideas of insubordination came drifting into Sir Isaac's Paradise. The\nepidemic is in the air. There is no Tempter nowadays, no definitive\napple. The disturbing force has grown subtler, blows in now like a\ndraught, creeps and gathers like the dust,--a disseminated serpent. Sir\nIsaac brought home his young, beautiful and rather crumpled and\nastonished Eve and by all his standards he was entitled to be happy ever\nafterwards. He knew of one danger, but against that he was very\nwatchful. Never once for six long years did she have a private duologue\nwith another male. But Mudie and Sir Jesse Boot sent parcels to the\nhouse unchecked, the newspaper drifted in not even censored: the nurses\nwho guided Ellen through the essential incidents of a feminine career\ntalked of something called a \"movement.\" And there was Georgina....\n\nThe thing they wanted they called the Vote, but that demand so hollow,\nso eyeless, had all the terrifying effect of a mask. Behind that mask\nwas a formless invincible discontent with the lot of womanhood. It\nwanted,--it was not clear what it wanted, but whatever it wanted, all\nthe domestic instincts of mankind were against admitting there was\nanything it could want. That remarkable agitation had already worked up\nto the thunderous pitch, there had been demonstrations at Public\nMeetings, scenes in the Ladies' Gallery and something like rioting in\nParliament Square before ever it occurred to Sir Isaac that this was a\ndisturbance that touched his home. He had supposed suffragettes were\nladies of all too certain an age with red noses and spectacles and a\nmasculine style of costume, who wished to be hugged by policemen. He\nsaid as much rather knowingly and wickedly to Charterson. He could not\nunderstand any woman not coveting the privileges of Lady Harman. And\nthen one day while Georgina and her mother were visiting them, as he was\nlooking over the letters at the breakfast table according to his custom\nbefore giving them out, he discovered two identical newspaper packets\naddressed to his wife and his sister-in-law, and upon them were these\nwords printed very plainly, \"Votes for Women.\"\n\n\"Good Lord!\" he cried. \"What's this? It oughtn't to be allowed.\" And he\npitched the papers at the wastepaper basket under the sideboard.\n\n\"I'll thank you,\" said Georgina, \"not to throw away our _Votes for\nWomen_. We subscribe to that.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" cried Sir Isaac.\n\n\"We're subscribers. Snagsby, just give us those papers.\" (A difficult\nmoment for Snagsby.) He picked up the papers and looked at Sir Isaac.\n\n\"Put 'em down there,\" said Sir Isaac, waving to the sideboard and then\nin an ensuing silence handed two letters of no importance to his\nmother-in-law. His face was pale and he was breathless. Snagsby with an\nobvious tactfulness retired.\n\nSir Isaac watched the door close.\n\nHis remark pointedly ignored Georgina.\n\n\"What you been thinking about, Elly,\" he asked, \"subscribing to _that_\nthing?\"\n\n\"I wanted to read it.\"\n\n\"But you don't hold with all that Rubbish----\"\n\n\"_Rubbish!_\" said Georgina, helping herself to marmalade.\n\n\"Well, rot then, if you like,\" said Sir Isaac, unamiably and panting.\n\nWith that as Snagsby afterwards put it--for the battle raged so fiercely\nas to go on even when he presently returned to the room--\"the fat was in\nthe fire.\" The Harman breakfast-table was caught up into the Great\nControversy with heat and fury like a tree that is overtaken by a forest\nfire. It burnt for weeks, and smouldered still when the first white\nheats had abated. I will not record the arguments of either side, they\nwere abominably bad and you have heard them all time after time; I do\nnot think that whatever side you have taken in this matter you would\nfind much to please you in Sir Isaac's goadings or Georgina's repartees.\nSir Isaac would ask if women were prepared to go as soldiers and\nGeorgina would enquire how many years of service he had done or horrify\nher mother by manifest allusion to the agonies and dangers of\nmaternity,--things like that. It gave a new interest to breakfast for\nSnagsby; and the peculiarly lady-like qualities of Mrs. Sawbridge, a\ngift for silent, pallid stiffness, a disposition, tactful but\nunsuccessful, to \"change the subject,\" an air of being about to leave\nthe room in disdain, had never shone with such baleful splendour. Our\ninterest here is rather with the effect of these remarkable disputes,\nwhich echoed in Sir Isaac's private talk long after Georgina had gone\nagain, upon Lady Harman. He could not leave this topic of feminine\nemancipation alone, once it had been set going, and though Ellen would\nalways preface her remarks by, \"Of course Georgina goes too far,\" he\nworried her slowly into a series of definite insurgent positions. Sir\nIsaac's attacks on Georgina certainly brought out a good deal of\nabsurdity in her positions, and Georgina at times left Sir Isaac without\na leg to stand on, and the net result of their disputes as of most human\ncontroversies was not conviction for the hearer but release. Her mind\nescaped between them, and went exploring for itself through the great\ngaps they had made in the simple obedient assumptions of her girlhood.\nThat question originally put in Paradise, \"Why shouldn't we?\" came into\nher mind and stayed there. It is a question that marks a definite stage\nin the departure from innocence. Things that had seemed opaque and\nimmutable appeared translucent and questionable. She began to read more\nand more in order to learn things and get a light upon things, and less\nand less to pass the time. Ideas came to her that seemed at first\nstrange altogether and then grotesquely justifiable and then crept to a\nsort of acceptance by familiarity. And a disturbing intermittent sense\nof a general responsibility increased and increased in her.\n\nYou will understand this sense of responsibility which was growing up in\nLady Harman's mind if you have felt it yourself, but if you have not\nthen you may find it a little difficult to understand. You see it comes,\nwhen it comes at all, out of a phase of disillusionment. All children, I\nsuppose, begin by taking for granted the rightness of things in general,\nthe soundness of accepted standards, and many people are at least so\nhappy that they never really grow out of this assumption. They go to the\ngrave with an unbroken confidence that somewhere behind all the\nimmediate injustices and disorders of life, behind the antics of\npolitics, the rigidities of institutions, the pressure of custom and the\nvagaries of law, there is wisdom and purpose and adequate provision,\nthey never lose that faith in the human household they acquired amongst\nthe directed securities of home. But for more of us and more there comes\na dissolution of these assurances; there comes illumination as the day\ncomes into a candle-lit uncurtained room. The warm lights that once\nrounded off our world so completely are betrayed for what they are,\nsmoky and guttering candles. Beyond what once seemed a casket of dutiful\nsecurity is now a limitless and indifferent universe. Ours is the wisdom\nor there is no wisdom; ours is the decision or there is no decision.\nThat burthen is upon each of us in the measure of our capacity. The\ntalent has been given us and we may not bury it.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a77\n\nAnd as we reckon up the disturbing influences that were stirring Lady\nHarman out of that life of acquiescences to which women are perhaps\neven more naturally disposed than men, we may pick out the conversation\nof Susan Burnet as something a little apart from the others, as\nsomething with a peculiar barbed pointedness of its own that was yet in\nother respects very representative of a multitude of nudges and nips and\npricks and indications that life was giving Lady Harman's awaking mind.\nSusan Burnet was a woman who came to renovate and generally do up the\nPutney curtains and furniture and loose covers every spring; she was\nMrs. Crumble's discovery, she was sturdy and short and she had open blue\neyes and an engaging simplicity of manner that attracted Lady Harman\nfrom the outset. She was stuck away in one of the spare bedrooms and\nthere she was available for any one, so long, she explained, as they\ndidn't fluster her when she was cutting out, with a flow of conversation\nthat not even a mouth full of pins seemed to interrupt. And Lady Harman\nwould go and watch Susan Burnet by the hour together and think what an\nenviably independent young woman she was, and listen with interest and\nsomething between horror and admiration to the various impressions of\nlife she had gathered during a hardy and adventurous career.\n\nTheir early conversations were about Susan Burnet's business and the\ngeneral condition of things in that world of upholsterers' young women\nin which Susan had lived until she perceived the possibilities of a\n\"connexion,\" and set up for herself. And the condition of things in that\nworld, as Susan described it, brought home to Lady Harman just how\nsheltered and limited her own upbringing had been. \"It isn't right,\"\nsaid Susan, \"the way they send girls out with fellers into empty houses.\nNaturally the men get persecuting them. They don't seem hardly able to\nhelp it, some of them, and I will say this for them, that a lot of the\ngirls go more than half way with them, leading them on. Still there's a\nsort of man won't leave you alone. One I used to be sent out with and a\nmarried man too he was, Oh!--he used to give me a time. Why I've bit his\nhands before now, bit hard, before he'd leave go of me. It's my opinion\nthe married men are worse than the single. Bolder they are. I pushed him\nover a scuttle once and he hit his head against a bookcase. I was fair\nfrightened of him. 'You little devil,' he says; 'I'll be even with you\nyet....' Oh! I've been called worse things than that.... Of course a\nrespectable girl gets through with it, but it's trying and to some it's\na sort of temptation....\"\n\n\"I should have thought,\" reflected Lady Harman, \"you could have told\nsomeone.\"\n\n\"It's queer,\" said Susan; \"but it never seemed to me the sort of thing a\ngirl ought to go telling. It's a kind of private thing. And besides, it\nisn't exactly easy to tell.... I suppose the Firm didn't want to be\nworried by complaints and disputes about that sort of thing. And it\nisn't always easy to say just which of the two is to blame.\"\n\n\"But how old are the girls they send out?\" asked Lady Harman.\n\n\"Some's as young as seventeen or eighteen. It all depends on the sort of\nwork that's wanted to be done....\"\n\n\"Of course a lot of them have to marry....\"\n\nThis lurid little picture of vivid happenings in unoccupied houses and\nparticularly of the prim, industrious, capable Susan Burnet, biting\naggressive wrists, stuck in Lady Harman's imagination. She seemed to be\nlooking into hitherto unsuspected pits of simple and violent living just\nbeneath her feet. Susan told some upholsteress love tales, real love\ntales, with a warmth and honesty of passion in them that seemed at once\ndreadful and fine to Lady Harman's underfed imagination. Under\nencouragement Susan expanded the picture, beyond these mere glimpses of\nworkshop and piece-work and furtive lust. It appeared that she was\npractically the head of her family; there was a mother who had\nspecialized in ill-health, a sister of defective ability who stayed at\nhome, a brother in South Africa who was very good and sent home money,\nand three younger sisters growing up. And father,--she evaded the\nsubject of father at first. Then presently Lady Harman had some glimpses\nof an earlier phase in Susan Burnet's life \"before any of us were\nearning money.\" Father appeared as a kindly, ineffectual, insolvent\nfigure struggling to conduct a baker's and confectioner's business in\nWalthamstow, mother was already specializing, there were various\nbrothers and sisters being born and dying. \"How many were there of you\naltogether?\" asked Lady Harman.\n\n\"Thirteen there was. Father always used to laugh and say he'd had a fair\nbaker's dozen. There was Luke to begin with----\"\n\nSusan began to count on her fingers and recite braces of scriptural\nnames.\n\nShe could only make up her tale to twelve. She became perplexed. Then\nshe remembered. \"Of course!\" she cried: \"there was Nicodemus. He was\nstill-born. I _always_ forget Nicodemus, poor little chap! But he\ncame--was it sixth or seventh?--seventh after Anna.\"\n\nShe gave some glimpses of her father and then there was a collapse of\nwhich she fought shy. Lady Harman was too delicate to press her to talk\nof that.\n\nBut one day in the afternoon Susan's tongue ran.\n\nShe was telling how first she went to work before she was twelve.\n\n\"But I thought the board schools----\" said Lady Harman.\n\n\"I had to go before the committee,\" said Susan. \"I had to go before the\ncommittee and ask to be let go to work. There they was, sitting round a\ntable in a great big room, and they was as kind as anything, one old\ngentleman with a great white beard, he was as kind as could be. 'Don't\nyou be frightened, my dear,' he says. 'You tell us why you want to go\nout working.' 'Well,' I says, '_somebody's_ got to earn something,' and\nthat made them laugh in a sort of fatherly way, and after that there\nwasn't any difficulty. You see it was after Father's Inquest, and\neverybody was disposed to be kind to us. 'Pity they can't all go\ninstead of this educational Tommy Rot,' the old gentleman says. 'You\nlearn to work, my dear'--and I did....\"\n\nShe paused.\n\n\"Father's inquest?\" said Lady Harman.\n\nSusan seemed to brace herself to the occasion. \"Father,\" she said, \"was\ndrowned. I know--I hadn't told you that before. He was drowned in the\nLea. It's always been a distress and humiliation to us there had to be\nan Inquest. And they threw out things.... It's why we moved to\nHaggerston. It's the worst that ever happened to us in all our lives.\nFar worse. Worse than having the things sold or the children with\nscarlet fever and having to burn everything.... I don't like to talk\nabout it. I can't help it but I don't....\n\n\"I don't know why I talk to you as I do, Lady Harman, but I don't seem\nto mind talking to you. I don't suppose I've opened my mouth to anyone\nabout it, not for years--except to one dear friend I've got--her who\npersuaded me to be a church member. But what I've always said and what I\nwill always say is this, that I don't believe any evil of Father, I\ndon't believe, I won't ever believe he took his life. I won't even\nbelieve he was in drink. I don't know how he got in the river, but I'm\ncertain it wasn't so. He was a weak man, was Father, I've never denied\nhe was a weak man. But a harder working man than he was never lived. He\nworried, anyone would have worried seeing the worries he had. The shop\nwasn't paying as it was; often we never tasted meat for weeks together,\nand then there came one of these Internationals, giving overweight and\nunderselling....\"\n\n\"One of these Internationals?\"\n\n\"Yes, I don't suppose you've ever heard of them. They're in the poorer\nneighbourhoods chiefly. They sell teas and things mostly now but they\nbegan as bakers' shops and what they did was to come into a place and\nundersell until all the old shops were ruined and shut up. That was what\nthey tried to do and Father hadn't no more chance amongst them than a\nmouse in a trap.... It was just like being run over. All the trade that\nstayed with us after a bit was Bad Debts. You can't blame people I\nsuppose for going where they get more and pay less, and it wasn't till\nwe'd all gone right away to Haggerston that they altered things and put\nthe prices up again. Of course Father lost heart and all that. He didn't\nknow what to do, he'd sunk all he had in the shop; he just sat and moped\nabout. Really,--he was pitiful. He wasn't able to sleep; he used to get\nup at nights and go about downstairs. Mother says she found him once\nsweeping out the bakehouse at two o'clock in the morning. He got it into\nhis head that getting up like that would help him. But I don't believe\nand I won't believe he wouldn't have seen it through if he could. Not to\nmy dying day will I believe that....\"\n\nLady Harman reflected. \"But couldn't he have got work again--as a\nbaker?\"\n\n\"It's hard after you've had a shop. You see all the younger men've come\non. They know the new ways. And a man who's had a shop and failed, he's\nlost heart. And these stores setting up make everything drivinger. They\ndo things a different way. They make it harder for everyone.\"\n\nBoth Lady Harman and Susan Burnet reflected in silence for a few seconds\nupon the International Stores. The sewing woman was the first to speak.\n\n\"Things like that,\" she said, \"didn't ought to be. One shop didn't ought\nto be allowed to set out to ruin another. It isn't fair trading, it's a\nsort of murder. It oughtn't to be allowed. How was father to know?...\"\n\n\"There's got to be competition,\" said Lady Harman.\n\n\"I don't call that competition,\" said Susan Burnet.\n\n\"But,--I suppose they give people cheaper bread.\"\n\n\"They do for a time. Then when they've killed you they do what they\nlike.... Luke--he's one of those who'll say anything--well, he used to\nsay it was a regular Monopoly. But it's hard on people who've set out to\nlive honest and respectable and bring up a family plain and decent to be\npushed out of the way like that.\"\n\n\"I suppose it is,\" said Lady Harman.\n\n\"What was father to _do_?\" said Susan, and turned to Sir Isaac's\narmchair from which this discourse had distracted her.\n\nAnd then suddenly, in a voice thick with rage, she burst out: \"And then\nAlice must needs go and take their money. That's what sticks in _my_\nthroat.\"\n\nStill on her knees she faced about to Lady Harman.\n\n\"Alice goes into one of their Ho'burn branches as a waitress, do what I\ncould to prevent her. It makes one mad to think of it. Time after time\nI've said to her, 'Alice,' I've said, 'sooner than touch their dirty\nmoney I'd starve in the street.' And she goes! She says it's all\nnonsense of me to bear a spite. Laughs at me! 'Alice,' I told her, 'it's\na wonder the spirit of poor father don't rise up against you.' And she\nlaughs. Calls that bearing a spite.... Of course she was little when it\nhappened. She can't remember, not as I remember....\"\n\nLady Harman reflected for a time. \"I suppose you don't know,\" she began,\naddressing Susan's industrious back; \"you don't know who--who owns these\nInternational Stores?\"\n\n\"I suppose it's some company,\" said Susan. \"I don't see that it lets\nthem off--being in a company.\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a78\n\nWe have done much in the last few years to destroy the severe\nlimitations of Victorian delicacy, and all of us, from princesses and\nprime-ministers' wives downward, talk of topics that would have been\nconsidered quite gravely improper in the nineteenth century.\nNevertheless, some topics have, if anything, become more indelicate than\nthey were, and this is especially true of the discussion of income, of\nany discussion that tends, however remotely, to inquire, Who is it at\nthe base of everything who really pays in blood and muscle and\ninvoluntary submissions for _your_ freedom and magnificence? This,\nindeed, is almost the ultimate surviving indecency. So that it was with\nconsiderable private shame and discomfort that Lady Harman pursued even\nin her privacy the train of thought that Susan Burnet had set going. It\nhad been conveyed into her mind long ago, and it had settled down there\nand grown into a sort of security, that the International Bread and Cake\nStores were a very important contribution to Progress, and that Sir\nIsaac, outside the gates of his home, was a very useful and beneficial\npersonage, and richly meriting a baronetcy. She hadn't particularly\nanalyzed this persuasion, but she supposed him engaged in a kind of\ndaily repetition, but upon modern scientific lines, of the miracle of\nthe loaves and fishes, feeding a great multitude that would otherwise\nhave gone hungry. She knew, too, from the advertisements that flowered\nabout her path through life, that this bread in question was\nexceptionally clean and hygienic; whole front pages of the _Daily\nMessenger_, headed the \"Fauna of Small Bakehouses,\" and adorned with a\nbordering of _Blatta orientalis_, the common cockroach, had taught her\nthat, and she knew that Sir Isaac's passion for purity had also led to\nthe _Old Country Gazette's_ spirited and successful campaign for a\nnon-party measure securing additional bakehouse regulation and\ninspection. And her impression had been that the growing and developing\nrefreshment side of the concern was almost a public charity; Sir Isaac\ngave, he said, a larger, heavier scone, a bigger pat of butter, a more\nelegant teapot, ham more finely cut and less questionable pork-pies\nthan any other system of syndicated tea-shops. She supposed that\nwhenever he sat late at night going over schemes and papers, or when he\nwent off for days together to Cardiff or Glasgow or Dublin, or such-like\ncentres, or when he became preoccupied at dinner and whistled\nthoughtfully through his teeth, he was planning to increase the amount\nor diminish the cost of tea and cocoa-drenched farinaceous food in the\nstomachs of that section of our national adolescence which goes out\ndaily into the streets of our great cities to be fed. And she knew his\nvans and catering were indispensable to the British Army upon its\nmanoeuvres....\n\nNow the smashing up of the Burnet family by the International Stores was\ndisagreeably not in the picture of these suppositions. And the\nremarkable thing is that this one little tragedy wouldn't for a moment\nallow itself to be regarded as an exceptional accident in an otherwise\nfair vast development. It remained obstinately a specimen--of the other\nside of the great syndication.\n\nIt was just as if she had been doubting subconsciously all along.... In\nthe silence of the night she lay awake and tried to make herself believe\nthat the Burnet case was just a unique overlooked disaster, that it\nneeded only to come to Sir Isaac's attention to be met by the fullest\nreparation....\n\nAfter all she did not bring it to Sir Isaac's attention.\n\nBut one morning, while this phase of new doubts was still lively in her\nmind, Sir Isaac told her he was going down to Brighton, and then along\nthe coast road in a car to Portsmouth, to pay a few surprise visits,\nand see how the machine was working. He would be away a night, an\nunusual breach in his habits.\n\n\"Are you thinking of any new branches, Isaac?\"\n\n\"I may have a look at Arundel.\"\n\n\"Isaac.\" She paused to frame her question carefully. \"I suppose there\nare some shops at Arundel now.\"\n\n\"I've got to see to that.\"\n\n\"If you open----I suppose the old shops get hurt. What becomes of the\npeople if they do get hurt?\"\n\n\"That's _their_ look-out,\" said Sir Isaac.\n\n\"Isn't it bad for them?\"\n\n\"Progress is Progress, Elly.\"\n\n\"It _is_ bad for them. I suppose----Wouldn't it be sometimes kinder if\nyou took over the old shop--made a sort of partner of him, or\nsomething?\"\n\nSir Isaac shook his head. \"I want younger men,\" he said. \"You can't get\na move on the older hands.\"\n\n\"But, then, it's rather bad----I suppose these little men you shut\nup,--some of them must have families.\"\n\n\"You're theorizing a bit this morning, Elly,\" said Sir Isaac, looking up\nover his coffee cup.\n\n\"I've been thinking--about these little people.\"\n\n\"Someone's been talking to you about my shops,\" said Sir Isaac, and\nstuck out an index finger. \"If that's Georgina----\"\n\n\"It isn't Georgina,\" said Lady Harman, but she had it very clear in her\nmind that she must not say who it was.\n\n\"You can't make a business without squeezing somebody,\" said Sir Isaac.\n\"It's easy enough to make a row about any concern that grows a bit. Some\npeople would like to have every business tied down to a maximum turnover\nand so much a year profit. I dare say you've been hearing of these\narticles in the _London Lion_. Pretty stuff it is, too. This fuss about\nthe little shopkeepers; that's a new racket. I've had all that row about\nthe waitresses before, and the yarn about the Normandy eggs, and all\nthat, but I don't see that you need go reading it against me, and\nbringing it up at the breakfast-table. A business is a business, it\nisn't a charity, and I'd like to know where you and I would be if we\ndidn't run the concern on business lines.... Why, that _London Lion_\nfellow came to me with the first two of those articles before the thing\nbegan. I could have had the whole thing stopped if I liked, if I'd\nchosen to take the back page of his beastly cover. That shows the stuff\nthe whole thing is made of. That shows you. Why!--he's just a\nblackmailer, that's what he is. Much he cares for my waitresses if he\ncan get the dibs. Little shopkeepers, indeed! I know 'em! Nice martyrs\nthey are! There isn't one wouldn't _skin_ all the others if he got half\na chance....\"\n\nSir Isaac gave way to an extraordinary fit of nagging anger. He got up\nand stood upon the hearthrug to deliver his soul the better. It was an\naltogether unexpected and illuminating outbreak. He was flushed with\nguilt. The more angry and eloquent he became, the more profoundly\nthoughtful grew the attentive lady at the head of his table....\n\nWhen at last Sir Isaac had gone off in the car to Victoria, Lady Harman\nrang for Snagsby. \"Isn't there a paper,\" she asked, \"called the _London\nLion_?\"\n\n\"It isn't one I think your ladyship would like,\" said Snagsby, gently\nbut firmly.\n\n\"I know. But I want to see it. I want copies of all the issues in which\nthere have been articles upon the International Stores.\"\n\n\"They're thoroughly volgar, me lady,\" said Snagsby, with a large\ndissuasive smile.\n\n\"I want you to go out into London and get them now.\"\n\nSnagsby hesitated and went. Within five minutes he reappeared with a\nhandful of buff-covered papers.\n\n\"There 'appened to be copies in the pantry, me lady,\" he said. \"We can't\nimagine 'ow they got there; someone must have brought them in, but 'ere\nthey are quite at your service, me lady.\" He paused for a discreet\nmoment. Something indescribably confidential came into his manner. \"I\ndoubt if Sir Isaac will quite like to 'ave them left about, me\nlady--after you done with them.\"\n\nShe was in a mood of discovery. She sat in the room that was all\nfurnished in pink (her favourite colour) and read a bitter, malicious,\ncoarsely written and yet insidiously credible account of her husband's\nbusiness methods. Something within herself seemed to answer, \"But didn't\nyou know this all along?\" That large conviction that her wealth and\nposition were but the culmination of a great and honourable social\nservice, a conviction that had been her tacit comfort during much\ndistasteful loyalty seemed to shrivel and fade. No doubt the writer was\na thwarted blackmailer; even her accustomed mind could distinguish a\ntwang of some such vicious quality in his sentences; but that did not\nalter the realities he exhibited and exaggerated. There was a\ndescription of how Sir Isaac pounced on his managers that was manifestly\nderived from a manager he had dismissed. It was dreadfully like him.\nConvincingly like him. There was a statement of the wages he paid his\ngirl assistants and long extracts from his codes of rules and schedules\nof fines....\n\nWhen she put down the paper she was suddenly afflicted by a vivid vision\nof Susan Burnet's father, losing heart and not knowing what to do. She\nhad an unreasonable feeling that Susan Burnet's father must have been a\nsmall, kindly, furry, bunnyish, little man. Of course there had to be\nprogress and the survival of the fittest. She found herself weighing\nwhat she imagined Susan Burnet's father to be like, against the ferrety\nface, stooping shoulders and scheming whistle of Sir Isaac.\n\nThere were times now when she saw her husband with an extreme\ndistinctness.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a79\n\nAs this cold and bracing realization that all was not right with her\nposition, with Sir Isaac's business procedure and the world generally,\ntook possession of Lady Harman's thoughts there came also with it and\narising out of it quite a series of new moods and dispositions. At times\nshe was very full of the desire \"to do something,\" something that would,\nas it were, satisfy and assuage this growing uneasiness of\nresponsibility in her mind. At times her consuming wish was not to\nassuage but escape from this urgency. It worried her and made her feel\nhelpless, and she wanted beyond anything else to get back to that\nchild's world where all experiences are adventurous and everything is\nfinally right. She felt, I think, that it was a little unfair to her\nthat this something within her should be calling upon her to take all\nsorts of things gravely--hadn't she been a good wife and brought four\nchildren into the world...?\n\nI am setting down here as clearly as possible what wasn't by any means\nclear in Lady Harman's mind. I am giving you side by side phases that\nnever came side by side in her thoughts but which followed and ousted\nand obliterated one another. She had moods of triviality. She had moods\nof magnificence. She had moods of intense secret hostility to her urgent\nlittle husband, and moods of genial tolerance for everything there was\nin her life. She had moods, and don't we all have moods?--of scepticism\nand cynicism, much profounder than the conventions and limitations of\nnovel-writing permit us to tell here. And for hardly any of these moods\nhad she terms and recognitions....\n\nIt isn't a natural thing to keep on worrying about the morality of\none's material prosperity. These are proclivities superinduced by modern\nconditions of the conscience. There is a natural resistance in every\nhealthy human being to such distressful heart-searchings. Strong\ninstincts battled in Lady Harman against this intermittent sense of\nresponsibility that was beginning to worry her. An immense lot of her\nwas for simply running away from these troublesome considerations, for\ncovering herself up from them, for distraction.\n\nAnd about this time she happened upon \"Elizabeth and her German Garden,\"\nand was very greatly delighted and stimulated by that little sister of\nMontaigne. She was charmed by the book's fresh gaiety, by its gallant\nresolve to set off all the good things there are in this world, the\nsunshine and flowers and laughter, against the limitations and\nthwartings and disappointments of life. For a time it seemed to her that\nthese brave consolations were solutions, and she was stirred by an\nimitative passion. How stupid had she not been to let life and Sir Isaac\novercome her! She felt that she must make herself like Elizabeth,\nexactly like Elizabeth; she tried forthwith, and a certain difficulty\nshe found, a certain deadness, she ascribed to the square modernity of\nher house and something in the Putney air. The house was too large, it\ndominated the garden and controlled her. She felt she must get away to\nsome place that was chiefly exterior, in the sunshine, far from towns\nand struggling, straining, angry and despairing humanity, from\nsyndicated shops and all the embarrassing challenges of life. Somehow\nthere it would be possible to keep Sir Isaac at arm's length; and the\nghost of Susan Burnet's father could be left behind to haunt the square\nrooms of the London house. And there she would live, horticultural,\nbookish, whimsical, witty, defiant, happily careless.\n\nAnd it was this particular conception of evasion that had set her\ncareering about the countryside in her car, looking for conceivable\nhouses of refuge from this dark novelty of social and personal care, and\nthat had driven her into the low long room of Black Strand and the\npresence of Mr. Brumley.\n\nOf what ensued and the appearance and influence of Lady Beach-Mandarin\nand how it led among other things to a lunch invitation from that lady\nthe reader has already been informed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE SIXTH\n\nTHE ADVENTUROUS AFTERNOON\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a71\n\nYou will perhaps remember that before I fell into this extensive\ndigression about Lady Harman's upbringing, we had got to the entry of\nMrs. Sawbridge into the house bearing a plunder of Sir Isaac's best\nroses. She interrupted a conversation of some importance. Those roses at\nthis point are still unwithered and fragrant, and moreover they are\narranged according to Mrs. Sawbridge's ideas of elegance about Sir\nIsaac's home.... And Sir Isaac, when that conversation could be renewed,\ncategorically forbade Lady Harman to go to Lady Beach-Mandarin's lunch\nand Lady Harman went to Lady Beach-Mandarin's lunch.\n\nShe had some peculiar difficulties in getting to that lunch.\n\nIt is necessary to tell certain particulars. They are particulars that\nwill distress the delicacy of Mrs. Sawbridge unspeakably if ever she\nchances to read this book. But a story has to be told. You see Sir Isaac\nHarman had never considered it advisable to give his wife a private\nallowance. Whatever she wished to have, he maintained, she could have.\nThe bill would afterwards be paid by his cheque on the first day of the\nmonth following the receipt of the bill. He found a generous pleasure in\nwriting these cheques, and Lady Harman was magnificently housed, fed and\nadorned. Moreover, whenever she chose to ask for money he gave her\nmoney, usually double of what she demanded,--and often a kiss or so into\nthe bargain. But after he had forbidden her to go to Lady\nBeach-Mandarin's so grave an estrangement ensued that she could not ask\nhim for money. A door closed between them. And the crisis had come at an\nunfortunate moment. She possessed the sum of five shillings and\neightpence.\n\nShe perceived quite early that this shortness of money would greatly\nembarrass the rebellion she contemplated. She was exceptionally ignorant\nof most worldly things, but she knew there was never yet a campaign\nwithout a war chest. She felt entitled to money....\n\nShe planned several times to make a demand for replenishment with a\nhaughty dignity; the haughty dignity was easy enough to achieve, but the\ndemand was not. A sensitive dread of her mother's sympathetic curiosity\nbarred all thoughts of borrowing in that direction,--she and her mother\n\"never discussed money matters.\" She did not want to get Georgina into\nfurther trouble. And besides, Georgina was in Devonshire.\n\nEven to get to Lady Beach-Mandarin's became difficult under these\ncircumstances. She knew that Clarence, though he would take her into the\ncountry quite freely, had been instructed, on account of Sir Isaac's\nexpressed dread of any accident happening to her while alone, not to\nplunge with her into the vortex of London traffic. Only under direct\norders from Sir Isaac would Clarence take her down Putney Hill; though\nshe might go up and away--to anywhere. She knew nothing of pawnshops or\nany associated methods of getting cash advances, and the possibility of\nusing the telephone to hire an automobile never occurred to her. But she\nwas fully resolved to go. She had one advantage in the fact that Sir\nIsaac didn't know the precise date of the disputed engagement. When that\narrived she spent a restless morning and dressed herself at last with\ngreat care. She instructed Peters, her maid, who participated in these\npreparations with a mild astonishment, that she was going out to lunch,\nasked her to inform Mrs. Sawbridge of the fact and, outwardly serene,\nmade a bolt for it down the staircase and across the hall. The great\nbutler appeared; she had never observed how like a large note of\ninterrogation his forward contours could be.\n\n\"I shall be out to lunch, Snagsby,\" she said, and went past him into the\nsunshine.\n\nShe left a discreetly astonished Snagsby behind her.\n\n(\"Now where are we going out to lunch?\" said Snagsby presently to\nPeters.\n\n\"I've never known her so particular with her clothes,\" said the maid.\n\n\"Never before--not in the same way; it's something new and special to\nthis affair,\" Snagsby reflected, \"I wonder now if Sir Isaac....\"\n\n\"One can't help observing things,\" said the maid, after a pause. \"Mute\nthough we be.\")\n\nLady Harman had the whole five and eightpence with her. She had managed\nto keep it intact in her jewel case, declaring she had no change when\nany small demands were made on her.\n\nWith an exhilaration so great that she wanted sorely to laugh aloud she\nwalked out through her big open gates and into the general publicity of\nPutney Hill. Why had she not done as much years ago? How long she had\nbeen, working up to this obvious thing! She hadn't been out in such\ncomplete possession of herself since she had been a schoolgirl. She held\nup a beautifully gloved hand to a private motor-car going downhill and\nthen to an engaged taxi going up, and then with a slightly dashed\nfeeling, picked up her skirt and walked observantly downhill. Her reason\ndispelled a transitory impression that these two vehicles were on Sir\nIsaac's side against her.\n\nThere was quite a nice taxi on the rank at the bottom of the hill. The\ndriver, a pleasant-looking young man in a white cap, seemed to have been\nwaiting for her in particular; he met her timid invitation halfway and\ncame across the road to her and jumped down and opened the door. He took\nher instructions as though they were after his own heart, and right in\nfront of her as she sat was a kind of tin cornucopia full of artificial\nflowers that seemed like a particular attention to her. His fare was two\nand eightpence and she gave him four shillings. He seemed quite\ngratified by her largesse, his manner implied he had always thought as\nmuch of her, from first to last their relations had been those of sunny\ncontentment, and it was only as she ascended the steps of Lady\nBeach-Mandarin's portico, that it occurred to her that she now had\ninsufficient money for an automobile to take her home. But there were\nrailways and buses and all sorts of possibilities; the day was an\nadventure; and she entered the drawing-room with a brow that was\nbeautifully unruffled. She wanted to laugh still; it animated her eyes\nand lips with the pleasantest little stir you can imagine.\n\n\"A-a-a-a-a-h!\" cried Lady Beach-Mandarin in a high note, and threw\nout--it had an effect of being quite a number of arms--as though she was\none of those brass Indian goddesses one sees.\n\nLady Harman felt taken in at once to all that capacious bosom involved\nand contained....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a72\n\nIt was quite an amusing lunch. But any lunch would have been amusing to\nLady Harman in the excitement of her first act of deliberate\ndisobedience. She had never been out to lunch alone in all her life\nbefore; she experienced a kind of scared happiness, she felt like\nsomeone at Lourdes who has just thrown away crutches. She was seated\nbetween a pink young man with an eyeglass whose place was labelled\n\"Bertie Trevor\" and who was otherwise unexplained, and Mr. Brumley. She\nwas quite glad to see Mr. Brumley again, and no doubt her eyes showed\nit. She had hoped to see him. Miss Sharsper was sitting nearly opposite\nto her, a real live novelist pecking observations out of life as a hen\npecks seeds amidst scenery, and next beyond was a large-headed\ninattentive fluffy person who was Mr. Keystone the well-known critic.\nAnd there was Agatha Alimony under a rustling vast hat of green-black\ncock's feathers next to Sir Markham Crosby, with whom she had been\nhaving an abusive controversy in the _Times_ and to whom quite\nelaborately she wouldn't speak, and there was Lady Viping with her\nlorgnette and Adolphus Blenker, Horatio's younger and if possible more\ngentlemanly brother--Horatio of the _Old Country Gazette_ that is--sole\nreminder that there was such a person as Sir Isaac in the world. Lady\nBeach-Mandarin's mother and the Swiss governess and the tall but\nretarded daughter, Phyllis, completed the party. The reception was\nlively and cheering; Lady Beach-Mandarin enfolded her guests in\ngenerosities and kept them all astir like a sea-swell under a squadron,\nand she introduced Lady Harman to Miss Alimony by public proclamation\nright across the room because there were two lavish tables of\nbric-\u00c3\u00a0-brac, a marble bust of old Beach-Mandarin and most of the rest of\nthe party in the way. And at the table conversation was like throwing\nbread, you never knew whom you might hit or who might hit you. (But Lady\nBeach-Mandarin produced an effect of throwing whole loaves.) Bertie\nTrevor was one of those dancing young men who talk to a woman as though\nthey were giving a dog biscuits, and mostly it was Mr. Brumley who did\nsuch talking as reached Lady Harman's ear.\n\nMr. Brumley was in very good form that day. He had contrived to remind\nher of all their Black Strand talk while they were still eating _Petites\nBouch\u00c3\u00a9es \u00c3\u00a0 la Reine_. \"Have you found that work yet?\" he asked and\ncarried her mind to the core of her situation. Then they were snatched\nup into a general discussion of Bazaars. Sir Markham spoke of a great\nbazaar that was to be held on behalf of one of the many Shakespear\nTheatre movements that were then so prevalent. Was Lady Beach-Mandarin\nimplicated? Was anyone? He told of novel features in contemplation. He\ngeneralized about bazaars and, with an air of having forgotten the\npresence of Miss Alimony, glanced at the Suffrage Bazaar--it was a\nseason of bazaars. He thought poorly of the Suffrage Bazaar. The hostess\nintervened promptly with anecdotes of her own cynical daring as a\nBazaar-seller, Miss Sharsper offered fragments of a reminiscence about\nsigning one of her own books for a Bookstall, Blenker told a well-known\nBazaar anecdote brightly and well, and the impending skirmish was\naverted.\n\nWhile the Bazaar talk still whacked to and fro about the table Mr.\nBrumley got at Lady Harman's ear again. \"Rather tantalizing these\nmeetings at table,\" he said. \"It's like trying to talk while you swim in\na rough sea....\"\n\nThen Lady Beach-Mandarin intervened with demands for support for her own\nparticular Bazaar project and they were eating salad before there was a\nchance of another word between them. \"I must confess that when I want to\ntalk to people I like to get them alone,\" said Mr. Brumley, and gave\nform to thoughts that were already on the verge of crystallization in\nher own mind. She had been recalling that she had liked his voice\nbefore, noting something very kindly and thoughtful and brotherly about\nhis right profile and thinking how much an hour's talk with him would\nhelp to clear up her ideas.\n\n\"But it's so difficult to get one alone,\" said Lady Harman, and suddenly\nan idea of the utmost daring and impropriety flashed into her mind. She\nwas on the verge of speaking it forthwith and then didn't, she met\nsomething in his eye that answered her own and then Lady Beach-Mandarin\nwas foaming over them like a dam-burst over an American town.\n\n\"What do _you_ think, Mr. Brumley?\" demanded Lady Beach-Mandarin.\n\n\"?\"\n\n\"About Sir Markham's newspaper symposium. They asked him what allowance\nhe gave his wife. Sent a prepaid reply telegram.\"\n\n\"But he hasn't got a wife!\"\n\n\"They don't stick at a little thing like that,\" said Sir Markham grimly.\n\n\"I think a husband and wife ought to have everything in common like the\nearly Christians,\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin. \"_We_ always did,\" and so\ngot the discussion afloat again off the sandbank of Mr. Brumley's\ninattention.\n\nIt was quite a good discussion and Lady Harman contributed an\nexceptionally alert and intelligent silence. Sir Markham distrusted Lady\nBeach-Mandarin's communism and thought that anyhow it wouldn't do for a\nfinancier or business man. He favoured an allowance. \"So did Sir\nJoshua,\" said the widow Viping. This roused Agatha Alimony. \"Allowance\nindeed!\" she cried. \"Is a wife to be on no better footing than a\ndaughter? The whole question of a wife's financial autonomy needs\nreconsidering....\"\n\nAdolphus Blenker became learned and lucid upon Pin-money and dowry and\nthe customs of savage tribes, and Mr. Brumley helped with\ncorroboration....\n\nMr. Brumley managed to say just one other thing to Lady Harman before\nthe lunch was over. It struck her for a moment as being irrelevant. \"The\ngardens at Hampton Court,\" he said, \"are delightful just now. Have you\nseen them? Autumnal fires. All the September perennials lifting their\nspears in their last great chorus. It's the _G\u00c3\u00b6tterd\u00c3\u00a4mmerung_ of the\nyear.\"\n\nShe was going out of the room before she appreciated his possible\nintention.\n\nLady Beach-Mandarin delegated Sir Markham to preside over the men's\ncigars and bounced and slapped her four ladies upstairs to the\ndrawing-room. Her mother disappeared and so did Phyllis and the\ngoverness. Lady Harman heard a large aside to Lady Viping: \"Isn't she\nperfectly lovely?\" glanced to discover the lorgnette in appreciative\naction, and then found herself drifting into a secluded window-seat and\na duologue with Miss Agatha Alimony. Miss Alimony was one of that large\nand increasing number of dusky, grey-eyed ladies who go through life\nwith an air of darkly incomprehensible significance. She led off Lady\nHarman as though she took her away to reveal unheard-of mysteries and\nher voice was a contralto undertone that she emphasized in some\ninexplicable way by the magnetic use of her eyes. Her hat of cock's\nfeathers which rustled like familiar spirits greatly augmented the\nprofundity of her effect. As she spoke she glanced guardedly at the\nother ladies at the end of the room and from first to last she seemed\nundecided in her own mind whether she was a conspirator or a prophetess.\nShe had heard of Lady Harman before, she had been longing impatiently to\ntalk to her all through the lunch. \"You are just what we want,\" said\nAgatha. \"What who want?\" asked Lady Harman, struggling against the\nhypnotic influence of her interlocutor. \"_We_,\" said Miss Agatha, \"the\nCause. The G.S.W.S.\n\n\"We want just such people as you,\" she repeated, and began in panting\nrhetorical sentences to urge the militant cause.\n\nFor her it was manifestly a struggle against \"the Men.\" Miss Alimony had\nno doubts of her sex. It had nothing to learn, nothing to be forgiven,\nit was compact of obscured and persecuted marvels, it needed only\nrevelation. \"They know Nothing,\" she said of the antagonist males,\nbringing deep notes out of the melodious caverns of her voice; \"they\nknow _Nothing_ of the Deeper Secrets of Woman's Nature.\" Her discourse\nof a general feminine insurrection fell in very closely with the spirit\nof Lady Harman's private revolt. \"We want the Vote,\" said Agatha, \"and\nwe want the Vote because the Vote means Autonomy. And then----\"\n\nShe paused voluminously. She had already used that word \"Autonomy\" at\nthe lunch table and it came to her hearer to supply a long-felt want.\nNow she poured meanings into it, and Lady Harman with each addition\nrealized more clearly that it was still a roomy sack for more. \"A woman\nshould be absolute mistress of herself,\" said Miss Alimony, \"absolute\nmistress of her person. She should be free to develop----\"\n\nGerminating phrases these were in Lady Harman's ear.\n\nShe wanted to know about the Suffrage movement from someone less\ngenerously impatient than Georgina, for Georgina always lost her temper\nabout it and to put it fairly _ranted_, this at any rate was serene and\nconfident, and she asked tentative ill-formed questions and felt her way\namong Miss Alimony's profundities. She had her doubts, her instinctive\ndoubts about this campaign of violence, she doubted its wisdom, she\ndoubted its rightness, and she perceived, but she found it difficult to\nexpress her perception, that Miss Alimony wasn't so much answering her\nobjections as trying to swamp her with exalted emotion. And if there was\nany flaw whatever in her attention to Miss Alimony's stirring talk, it\nwas because she was keeping a little look-out in the tail of her eye\nfor the reappearance of the men, and more particularly for the\nreappearance of Mr. Brumley with whom she had a peculiar feeling of\nuncompleted relations. And at last the men came and she caught his\nglance and saw that her feeling was reciprocated.\n\nShe was presently torn from Agatha, who gasped with pain at the parting\nand pursued her with a sedulous gaze as a doctor might watch an injected\npatient, she parted with Lady Beach-Mandarin with a vast splash of\nenthusiasm and mutual invitations, and Lady Viping came and pressed her\nto come to dinner and rapped her elbow with her lorgnette to emphasize\nher invitation. And Lady Harman after a still moment for reflection\nathwart which the word Autonomy flickered, accepted this invitation\nalso.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a73\n\nMr. Brumley hovered for a few moments in the hall conversing with Lady\nBeach-Mandarin's butler, whom he had known for some years and helped\nabout a small investment, and who was now being abjectly polite and\ngrateful to him for his attention. It gave Mr. Brumley a nice feudal\nfeeling to establish and maintain such relationships. The furry-eyed boy\nfumbled with the sticks and umbrellas in the background and wondered if\nhe too would ever climb to these levels of respectful gilt-tipped\nfriendliness. Mr. Brumley hovered the more readily because he knew Lady\nHarman was with the looking-glass in the little parlour behind the\ndining-room on her way to the outer world. At last she emerged. It was\ninstantly manifest to Mr. Brumley that she had expected to find him\nthere. She smiled frankly at him, with the faintest admission of\ncomplicity in her smile.\n\n\"Taxi, milady?\" said the butler.\n\nShe seemed to reflect. \"No, I will walk.\" She hesitated over a glove\nbutton. \"Mr. Brumley, is there a Tube station near here?\"\n\n\"Not two minutes. But can't I perhaps take you in a taxi?\"\n\n\"I'd rather walk.\"\n\n\"I will show you----\"\n\nHe found himself most agreeably walking off with her.\n\nStill more agreeable things were to follow for Mr. Brumley.\n\nShe appeared to meditate upon a sudden idea. She disregarded some\nconversational opening of his that he forgot in the instant. \"Mr.\nBrumley,\" she said, \"I didn't intend to go directly home.\"\n\n\"I'm altogether at your service,\" said Mr. Brumley.\n\n\"At least,\" said Lady Harman with that careful truthfulness of hers, \"it\noccurred to me during lunch that I wouldn't go directly home.\"\n\nMr. Brumley reined in an imagination that threatened to bolt with him.\n\n\"I want,\" said Lady Harman, \"to go to Kensington Gardens, I think. This\ncan't be far from Kensington Gardens--and I want to sit there on a green\nchair and--meditate--and afterwards I want to find a tube railway or\nsomething that will take me back to Putney. There is really no need for\nme to go directly home.... It's very stupid of me but I don't know my\nway about London as a rational creature should do. So will you take me\nand put me in a green chair and--tell me how afterwards I can find the\nTube and get home? Do you mind?\"\n\n\"All my time, so long as you want it, is at your service,\" said Mr.\nBrumley with convincing earnestness. \"And it's not five minutes to the\ngardens. And afterwards a taxi-cab----\"\n\n\"No,\" said Lady Harman mindful of her one-and-eightpence, \"I prefer a\ntube. But that we can talk about later. You're sure, Mr. Brumley, I'm\nnot invading your time?\"\n\n\"I wish you could see into my mind,\" said Mr. Brumley.\n\nShe became almost barefaced. \"It is so true,\" she said, \"that at lunch\none can't really talk to anyone. And I've so wanted to talk to you. Ever\nsince we met before.\"\n\nMr. Brumley conveyed an unfeigned delight.\n\n\"Since then,\" said Lady Harman, \"I've read your _Euphemia_ books.\" Then\nafter a little unskilful pause, \"again.\" Then she blushed and added, \"I\n_had_ read one of them, you know, before.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" he said with an infinite helpfulness.\n\n\"And you seem so sympathetic, so understanding. I feel that all sorts of\nthings that are muddled in my mind would come clear if I could have a\nreally Good Talk. To you....\"\n\nThey were now through the gates approaching the Albert Memorial. Mr.\nBrumley was filled with an idea so desirable that it made him fear to\nsuggest it.\n\n\"Of course we can talk very comfortably here,\" he said, \"under these\ngreat trees. But I do so wish----Have you seen those great borders at\nHampton Court? The whole place is glowing, and in such sunshine as\nthis----A taxi--will take us there under the hour. If you are free until\nhalf-past five.\"\n\n_Why shouldn't she?_\n\nThe proposal seemed so outrageous to all the world of Lady Harman that\nin her present mood she felt it was her duty in the cause of womanhood\nto nerve herself and accept it....\n\n\"I mustn't be later than half-past five.\"\n\n\"We could snatch a glimpse of it all and be back before then.\"\n\n\"In that case----It would be very agreeable.\"\n\n(_Why shouldn't she?_ It would no doubt make Sir Isaac furiously\nangry--if he heard of it. But it was the sort of thing other women of\nher class did; didn't all the novels testify? She had a perfect\nright----\n\nAnd besides, Mr. Brumley was so entirely harmless.)\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a74\n\nIt had been Lady Harman's clear intention to have a luminous and\nilluminating discussion of the peculiar difficulties and perplexities of\nher position with Mr. Brumley. Since their first encounter this idea\nhad grown up in her mind. She was one of those women who turn\ninstinctively to men and away from women for counsel. There was to her\nperception something wise and kindly and reassuring in him; she felt\nthat he had lived and suffered and understood and that he was ready to\nhelp other people to live; his heart she knew from his published works\nwas buried with his dead Euphemia, and he seemed as near a thing to a\nbrother and a friend as she was ever likely to meet. She wanted to tell\nhim all this and then to broach her teeming and tangled difficulties,\nabout her own permissible freedoms, about her social responsibilities,\nabout Sir Isaac's business. But now as their taxi dodged through the\ntraffic of Kensington High Street and went on its way past Olympia and\nso out westwards, she found it extremely difficult to fix her mind upon\nthe large propositions with which it had been her intention to open. Do\nas she would to feel that this was a momentous occasion, she could not\nsuppress, she could not ignore an obstinate and entirely undignified\npersuasion that she was having a tremendous lark. The passing vehicles,\nvarious motors, omnibuses, vans, carriages, the thronging pedestrians,\nthe shops and houses, were all so distractingly interesting that at last\nshe had to put it fairly to herself whether she hadn't better resign\nherself to the sensations of the present and reserve that sustained\ndiscussion for an interval she foresaw as inevitable on some comfortable\nseat under great trees at Hampton Court. You cannot talk well and\npenetratingly about fundamental things when you are in a not too\nwell-hung taxi which is racing to get ahead of a vast red\nmotor-omnibus....\n\nWith a certain discretion Mr. Brumley had instructed the chauffeur to\ncross the river not at Putney but at Hammersmith, and so they went by\nBarnes station and up a still almost rural lane into Richmond Park, and\nthere suddenly they were among big trees and bracken and red deer and it\nmight have been a hundred miles from London streets. Mr. Brumley\ndirected the driver to make a detour that gave them quite all the best\nof the park.\n\nThe mind of Mr. Brumley was also agreeably excited and dispersed on this\noccasion. It was an occasion of which he had been dreaming very\nfrequently of late, he had invented quite remarkable dialogues during\nthose dreams, and now he too was conversationally inadequate and with a\nsimilar feeling of unexpected adventure. He was now no more ready to go\nto the roots of things than Lady Harman. He talked on the way down\nchiefly of the route they were following, of the changes in the London\ntraffic due to motor traction and of the charm and amenity of Richmond\nPark. And it was only after they had arrived at Hampton Court and\ndismissed the taxi and spent some time upon the borders, that they came\nat last to a seat under a grove beside a long piece of water bearing\nwater lilies, and sat down and made a beginning with the Good Talk. Then\nindeed she tried to gather together the heads of her perplexity and Mr.\nBrumley did his best to do justice to confidence she reposed in him....\n\nIt wasn't at all the conversation he had dreamt of; it was halting, it\nwas inconclusive, it was full of a vague dissatisfaction.\n\nThe roots of this dissatisfaction lay perhaps more than anything else in\nher inattention to him--how shall I say it?--as _Him_. Hints have been\nconveyed to the reader already that for Mr. Brumley the universe was\nlargely a setting, a tangle, a maze, a quest enshrining at the heart of\nit and adumbrating everywhere, a mystical Her, and his experience of\nthis world had pointed him very definitely to the conclusion that for\nthat large other half of mankind which is woman, the quality of things\nwas reciprocal and centred, for all the appearances and pretences of\nother interests, in--Him. And he was disposed to believe that the other\nthings in life, not merely the pomp and glories but the faiths and\nambitions and devotions, were all demonstrably little more than posings\nand dressings of this great duality. A large part of his own interests\nand of the interests of the women he knew best, was the sustained and in\nsome cases recurrent discovery and elaboration of lights and glimpses of\nHim or Her as the case might be, in various definite individuals; and it\nwas a surprise to him, it perplexed him to find that this lovely person,\nso beautifully equipped for those mutual researches which constituted,\nhe felt, the heart of life, was yet completely in her manner unaware of\nthis primary sincerity and looking quite simply, as it were, over him\nand through him at such things as the ethics of the baking,\nconfectionery and refreshment trade and the limits of individual\nresponsibility in these matters. The conclusion that she was\n\"unawakened\" was inevitable.\n\nThe dream of \"awakening\" this Sleeping Beauty associated itself in a\nlogical sequence with his interpretations. I do not say that such\nthoughts were clear in Mr. Brumley's mind, they were not, but into this\nshape the forms of his thoughts fell. Such things dimly felt below the\nclear level of consciousness were in him. And they gave his attempt to\ntake up and answer the question that perplexed her, something of the\nquality of an attempt to clothe and serve hidden purposes. It could not\nbut be evident to him that the effort of Lady Harman to free herself a\nlittle from her husband's circumvallation and to disentangle herself a\nlittle from the realities of his commercial life, might lead to such a\nliberation as would leave her like a nascent element ready to recombine.\nAnd it was entirely in the vein of this drift of thought in him that he\nshould resolve upon an assiduous proximity against that moment of\nrelease and awakening....\n\nI do not do Mr. Brumley as the human lover justice if I lead you to\nsuppose that he plotted thus clearly and calculatingly. Yet all this was\nin his mind. All this was in Mr. Brumley, but it wasn't Mr. Brumley.\nPresented with it as a portrait of his mind, he would have denied it\nindignantly--and, knowing it was there, have grown a little flushed in\nhis denials. Quite equally in his mind was a simple desire to please\nher, to do what she wished, to help her because she wanted help. And a\nquite keen desire to be clean and honest about her and everything\nconnected with her, for his own sake as well as for her sake--for the\nsake of the relationship....\n\nSo you have Mr. Brumley on the green seat under the great trees at\nHampton Court, in his neat London clothes, his quite becoming silk-hat,\nabove his neatly handsome and intelligent profile, with his gloves in\nhis hand and one arm over the seat back, going now very earnestly and\nthoughtfully into the question of the social benefit of the\nInternational Bread and Cake Stores and whether it was possible for her\nto \"do anything\" to repair any wrongs that might have arisen out of that\norganization, and you will understand why there is a little flush in his\ncheek and why his sentences are a trifle disconnected and tentative and\nwhy his eye wanders now to the soft raven tresses about Lady Harman's\near, now to the sweet movement of her speaking lips and now to the\ngracious droop of her pose as she sits forward, elbow upon crossed knee\nand chin on glove, and jabs her parasol at the ground in her\nunaccustomed efforts to explain and discuss the difficulties of her\nposition.\n\nAnd you will understand too why it is that he doesn't deal with the\nquestion before him so simply and impartially as he seems to do.\nObscuring this extremely interesting problem of a woman growing to\nman-like sense of responsibility in her social consequences, is the\ndramatic proclivity that makes him see all this merely as something\nwhich must necessarily weaken Lady Harman's loyalty and qualify her\nsubmission to Sir Isaac, that makes him want to utilize it and develop\nit in that direction....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a75\n\nMoreover so complex is the thought of man, there was also another stream\nof mental activity flowing in the darker recesses of Mr. Brumley's mind.\nUnobtrusively he was trying to count the money in his pockets and make\ncertain estimates.\n\nIt had been his intention to replenish his sovereign purse that\nafternoon at his club and he was only reminded of this abandoned plan\nwhen he paid off his taxi at the gates of Hampton Court. The fare was\nnine and tenpence and the only piece of gold he had was a\nhalf-sovereign. But there was a handful of loose silver in his trouser\npocket and so the fare and tip were manageable. \"Will you be going back,\nsir?\" asked the driver.\n\nAnd Mr. Brumley reflected too briefly and committed a fatal error. \"No,\"\nhe said with his mind upon that loose silver. \"We shall go back by\ntrain.\"\n\nNow it is the custom with taxi-cabs that take people to such outlying\nand remote places as Hampton Court, to be paid off and to wait loyally\nuntil their original passengers return. Thereby the little machine is\nrestrained from ticking out twopences which should go in the main to the\nabsent proprietor, and a feeling of mutuality is established between the\ndriver and his fare. But of course this cab being released presently\nfound another passenger and went away....\n\nI have written in vain if I have not conveyed to you that Mr. Brumley\nwas a gentleman of great and cultivated delicacy, that he liked the\nseemly and handsome side of things and dreaded the appearance of any\nflaw upon his prosperity as only a man trained in an English public\nschool can do. It was intolerable to think of any hitch in this happy\nexcursion which was to establish he knew not what confidence between\nhimself and Lady Harman. From first to last he felt it had to go with an\nair--and what was the first class fare from Hampton Court to\nPutney--which latter station he believed was on the line from Hampton\nCourt to London--and could one possibly pretend it was unnecessary to\nhave tea? And so while Lady Harman talked about her husband's\nbusiness--\"our business\" she called it--and shrank from ever saying\nanything more about the more intimate question she had most in mind, the\nlimits to a wife's obedience, Mr. Brumley listened with these financial\nsolicitudes showing through his expression and giving it a quality of\nintensity that she found remarkably reassuring. And once or twice they\nmade him miss points in her remarks that forced him back upon that very\ninferior substitute for the apt answer, a judicious \"Um.\"\n\n(It would be quite impossible to go without tea, he decided. He himself\nwanted tea quite badly. He would think better when he had had some\ntea....)\n\nThe crisis came at tea. They had tea at the inn upon the green that\nstruck Mr. Brumley as being most likely to be cheap and which he\npretended to choose for some trivial charm about the windows. And it\nwasn't cheap, and when at last Mr. Brumley was faced by the little slip\nof the bill and could draw his money from his pocket and look at it, he\nknew the worst and the worst was worse than he had expected. The bill\nwas five shillings (Should he dispute it? Too ugly altogether, a dispute\nwith a probably ironical waiter!) and the money in his hand amounted to\nfour shillings and sixpence.\n\nHe acted surprise with the waiter's eye upon him. (Should he ask for\ncredit? They might be frightfully disagreeable in such a cockney resort\nas this.) \"Tut, tut,\" said Mr. Brumley, and then--a little late for\nit--resorted to and discovered the emptiness of his sovereign purse. He\nrealized that this was out of the picture at this stage, felt his ears\nand nose and cheeks grow hot and pink. The waiter's colleague across the\nroom became interested in the proceedings.\n\n\"I had no idea,\" said Mr. Brumley, which was a premeditated falsehood.\n\n\"Is anything the matter?\" asked Lady Harman with a sisterly interest.\n\n\"My dear Lady Harman, I find myself----Ridiculous position. Might I\nborrow half a sovereign?\"\n\nHe felt sure that the two waiters exchanged glances. He looked at\nthem,--a mistake again--and got hotter.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Lady Harman and regarded him with frank amusement in her\neyes. The thing struck her at first in the light of a joke. \"I've only\ngot one-and-eightpence. I didn't expect----\"\n\nShe blushed as beautifully as ever. Then she produced a small but\nplutocratic-looking purse and handed it to him.\n\n\"Most remarkable--inconvenient,\" said Mr. Brumley, opening the precious\nthing and extracting a shilling. \"That will do,\" he said and dismissed\nthe waiter with a tip of sixpence. Then with the open purse still in his\nhand, he spent much of his remaining strength trying to look amused and\nunembarrassed, feeling all the time that with his flushed face and in\nview of all the circumstances of the case he must be really looking very\nsilly and fluffy.\n\n\"It's really most inconvenient,\" he remarked.\n\n\"I never thought of the--of this. It was silly of me,\" said Lady Harman.\n\n\"Oh no! Oh dear no! The silliness I can assure you is all mine. I can't\ntell you how entirely apologetic----Ridiculous fix. And after I had\npersuaded you to come here.\"\n\n\"Still we were able to pay,\" she consoled him.\n\n\"But you have to get home!\"\n\nShe hadn't so far thought of that. It brought Sir Isaac suddenly into\nthe picture. \"By half-past five,\" she said with just the faintest\nflavour of interrogation.\n\nMr. Brumley looked at his watch. It was ten minutes to five.\n\n\"Waiter,\" he said, \"how do the trains run from here to Putney?\"\n\n\"I don't _think_, sir, that we have any trains from here to Putney----\"\n\nAn A.B.C. Railway Guide was found and Mr. Brumley learnt for the first\ntime that Putney and Hampton Court are upon two distinct and separate\nand, as far as he could judge by the time-table, mutually hostile\nbranches of the South Western Railway, and that at the earliest they\ncould not get to Putney before six o'clock.\n\nMr. Brumley was extremely disconcerted. He perceived that he ought to\nhave kept his taxi. It amounted almost to a debt of honour to deliver\nthis lady secure and untarnished at her house within the next hour. But\nthis reflection did not in the least degree assist him to carry it out\nand as a matter of fact Mr. Brumley became flurried and did not carry it\nout. He was not used to being without money, it unnerved him, and he\ngave way to a kind of hectic _savoir faire_. He demanded a taxi of the\nwaiter. He tried to evolve a taxi by will power alone. He went out with\nLady Harman and back towards the gates of Hampton Court to look for\ntaxis. Then it occurred to him that they might be losing the 5.25 up. So\nthey hurried over the bridge of the station.\n\nHe had a vague notion that he would be able to get tickets on credit at\nthe booking office if he presented his visiting card. But the clerk in\ncharge seemed to find something uncongenial in his proposal. He did not\nseem to like what he saw of Mr. Brumley through his little square window\nand Mr. Brumley found something slighting and unpleasant in his manner.\nIt was one of those little temperamental jars which happen to men of\ndelicate sensibilities and Mr. Brumley tried to be reassuringly\noverbearing in his manner and then lost his temper and was threatening\nand so wasted precious moments what time Lady Harman waited on the\nplatform, with a certain shadow of doubt falling upon her confidence in\nhim, and watched the five-twenty-five gather itself together and start\nLondonward. Mr. Brumley came out of the ticket office resolved to travel\nwithout tickets and carry things through with a high hand just as it\nbecame impossible to do so by that train, and then I regret to say he\nreturned for some further haughty passages with the ticket clerk upon\nthe duty of public servants to point out such oversights as his, that\nled to repartee and did nothing to help Lady Harman on her homeward way.\n\nThen he discovered a current time-table and learnt that now even were\nall the ticket difficulties over-ridden he could not get Lady Harman to\nPutney before twenty minutes past seven, so completely is the South\nWestern Railway not organized for conveying people from Hampton Court to\nPutney. He explained this as well as he could to Lady Harman, and then\nled her out of the station in another last desperate search for a taxi.\n\n\"We can always come back for that next train,\" he said. \"It doesn't go\nfor half an hour.\"\n\n\"I cannot blame myself sufficiently,\" he said for the eighth or ninth\ntime....\n\nIt was already well past a quarter to six before Mr. Brumley bethought\nhimself of the London County Council tramcars that run from the palace\ngates. Along these an ample four-pennyworth was surely possible and at\nthe end would be taxis----There _must_ be taxis. The tram took\nthem--but oh! how slowly it seemed!--to Hammersmith by a devious route\nthrough interminable roads and streets, and long before they reached\nthat spot twilight had passed into darkness, and all the streets and\nshops were flowering into light and the sense of night and lateness was\nvery strong. After they were seated in the tram a certain interval of\nsilence came between them and then Lady Harman laughed and Mr. Brumley\nlaughed--there was no longer any need for him to be energetic and\nfussy--and they began to have that feeling of adventurous amusement\nwhich comes on the further side of desperation. But beneath the\ntemporary elation Lady Harman was a prey to grave anxieties and Mr.\nBrumley could not help thinking he had made a tremendous ass of himself\nin that ticket clerk dispute....\n\nAt Hammersmith they got out, two quite penniless travellers, and after\nsome anxious moments found a taxi. It took them to Putney Hill. Lady\nHarman descended at the outer gates of her home and walked up the drive\nin the darkness while Mr. Brumley went on to his club and solvency\nagain. It was five minutes past eight when he entered the hall of his\nclub....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a76\n\nIt had been Lady Harman's original intention to come home before four,\nto have tea with her mother and to inform her husband when he returned\nfrom the city of her entirely dignified and correct disobedience to his\nabsurd prohibitions. Then he would have bullied at a disadvantage, she\nwould have announced her intention of dining with Lady Viping and making\nthe various calls and expeditions for which she had arranged and all\nwould have gone well. But you see how far accident and a spirit of\nenterprise may take a lady from so worthy a plan, and when at last she\nreturned to the Victorian baronial home in Putney it was very nearly\neight and the house blazed with crisis from pantry to nursery. Even the\nelder three little girls, who were accustomed to be kissed goodnight by\ntheir \"boofer muvver,\" were still awake and--catching the subtle\ninfluence of the atmosphere of dismay about them--in tears. The very\nunder-housemaids were saying: \"Where _ever_ can her ladyship 'ave got\nto?\"\n\nSir Isaac had come home that day at an unusually early hour and with a\npeculiar pinched expression that filled even Snagsby with apprehensive\nalertness. Sir Isaac had in fact returned in a state of quite unwonted\nvenom. He had come home early because he wished to vent it upon Ellen,\nand her absence filled him with something of that sensation one has when\none puts out a foot for the floor and instead a step drops one down--it\nseems abysmally.\n\n\"But where's she gone, Snagsby?\"\n\n\"Her ladyship _said_ to lunch, Sir Isaac,\" said Snagsby.\n\n\"Good gracious! Where?\"\n\n\"Her ladyship didn't _say_, Sir Isaac.\"\n\n\"But where? Where the devil----?\"\n\n\"I have--'ave no means whatever of knowing, Sir Isaac.\"\n\nHe had a defensive inspiration.\n\n\"Perhaps Mrs. Sawbridge, Sir Isaac....\"\n\nMrs. Sawbridge was enjoying the sunshine upon the lawn. She sat in the\nmost comfortable garden chair, held a white sunshade overhead, had the\nlast new novel by Mrs. Humphry Ward upon her lap, and was engaged in\ntrying not to wonder where her daughter might be. She beheld with a\ndistinct blenching of the spirit Sir Isaac advancing towards her. She\nwondered more than ever where Ellen might be.\n\n\"Here!\" cried her son-in-law. \"Where's Ellen gone?\"\n\nMrs. Sawbridge with an affected off-handedness was sure she hadn't the\nfaintest idea.\n\n\"Then you _ought_ to have,\" said Isaac. \"She ought to be at home.\"\n\nMrs. Sawbridge's only reply was to bridle slightly.\n\n\"Where's she got to? Where's she gone? Haven't you any idea at all?\"\n\n\"I was not favoured by Ellen's confidence,\" said Mrs. Sawbridge.\n\n\"But you _ought_ to know,\" cried Sir Isaac. \"She's your daughter. Don't\nyou know anything of _either_ of your daughters. I suppose you don't\ncare where they are, either of them, or what mischief they're up to.\nHere's a man--comes home early to his tea--and no wife! After hearing\nall I've done at the club.\"\n\nMrs. Sawbridge stood up in order to be more dignified than a seated\nposition permitted.\n\n\"It is scarcely my business, Sir Isaac,\" she said, \"to know of the\nmovements of your wife.\"\n\n\"Nor Georgina's apparently either. Good God! I'd have given a hundred\npounds that this shouldn't have happened!\"\n\n\"If you must speak to me, Sir Isaac, will you please kindly refrain\nfrom--from the deity----\"\n\n\"Oh! shut it!\" said Sir Isaac, blazing up to violent rudeness. \"Why!\nDon't you know, haven't you an idea? The infernal foolery! Those\ntickets. She got those women----Look here, if you go walking away with\nyour nose in the air before I've done----Look here! Mrs. Sawbridge, you\nlisten to me----Georgina. I'm speaking of Georgina.\"\n\nThe lady was walking now swiftly and stiffly towards the house, her face\nvery pale and drawn, and Sir Isaac hurrying beside her in a white fury\nof expostulation. \"I tell you,\" he cried, \"Georgina----\"\n\nThere was something maddeningly incurious about her. He couldn't\nunderstand why she didn't even pause to hear what Georgina had done and\nwhat he had to say about it. A person so wrapped up in her personal and\nprivate dignity makes a man want to throw stones. Perhaps she knew of\nGeorgina's misdeeds. Perhaps she sympathized....\n\nA sense of the house windows checked his pursuit of her ear. \"Then go,\"\nhe said to her retreating back. \"_Go!_ I don't care if you go for good.\nI don't care if you go altogether. If _you_ hadn't had the upbringing of\nthese two girls----\"\n\nShe was manifestly out of earshot and in full yet almost queenly flight\nfor the house. He wanted to say things about her. _To_ someone. He was\nalready saying things to the garden generally. What does one marry a\nwife for? His mind came round to Ellen again. Where had she got to? Even\nif she had gone out to lunch, it was time she was back. He went to his\nstudy and rang for Snagsby.\n\n\"Lady Harman back yet?\" he asked grimly.\n\n\"No, Sir Isaac.\"\n\n\"Why isn't she back?\"\n\nSnagsby did his best. \"Perhaps, Sir Isaac, her ladyship has\nexperienced--'as hexperienced a naxident.\"\n\nSir Isaac stared at that idea for a moment. Then he thought, 'Someone\nwould have telephoned,' \"No,\" he said, \"she's out. That's where she is.\nAnd I suppose I can wait here, as well as I can until she chooses to\ncome home. Degenerate foolish nonsense!...\"\n\nHe whistled between his teeth like an escape of steam. Snagsby, after\nthe due pause of attentiveness, bowed respectfully and withdrew....\n\nHe had barely time to give a brief outline of the interview to the\npantry before a violent ringing summoned him again. Sir Isaac wished to\nspeak to Peters, Lady Harman's maid. He wanted to know where Lady Harman\nhad gone; this being impossible, he wanted to know where Lady Harman had\nseemed to be going.\n\n\"Her Ladyship _seemed_ to be going out to lunch, Sir Isaac,\" said\nPeters, her meek face irradiated by helpful intelligence.\n\n\"Oh _get_ out!\" said Sir Isaac. \"_Get_ out!\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir Isaac,\" said Peters and obeyed....\n\n\"He's in a rare bait about her,\" said Peters to Snagsby downstairs.\n\n\"I'm inclined to think her ladyship will catch it pretty hot,\" said\nSnagsby.\n\n\"He can't _know_ anything,\" said Peters.\n\n\"What about?\" asked Snagsby.\n\n\"Oh, _I_ don't know,\" said Peters. \"Don't ask _me_ about her....\"\n\nAbout ten minutes later Sir Isaac was heard to break a little china\nfigure of the goddess Kwannon, that had stood upon his study\nmantel-shelf. The fragments were found afterwards in the fireplace....\n\nThe desire for self-expression may become overwhelming. After Sir Isaac\nhad talked to himself about Georgina and Lady Harman for some time in\nhis study, he was seized with a great longing to pour some of this\nspirited stuff into the entirely unsympathetic ear of Mrs. Sawbridge. So\nhe went about the house and garden looking for her, and being at last\nobliged to enquire about her, learnt from a scared defensive housemaid\nwhom he cornered suddenly in the conservatory, that she had retired to\nher own room. He went and rapped at her door but after one muffled\n\"Who's that?\" he could get no further response.\n\n\"I want to tell you about Georgina,\" he said.\n\nHe tried the handle but the discreet lady within had turned the key upon\nher dignity.\n\n\"I want,\" he shouted, \"to tell you about Georgina.... GEORGINA! Oh\n_damn_!\"\n\nSilence.\n\nTea awaited him downstairs. He hovered about the drawing-room, making\nnoises between his teeth.\n\n\"Snagsby,\" said Sir Isaac, \"just tell Mrs. Sawbridge I shall be obliged\nif she will come down to tea.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Sawbridge 'as a '_ead_ache, Sir Isaac,\" said Mr. Snagsby with\nextreme blandness. \"She asked me to acquaint you. She 'as ordered tea in\n'er own apartment.\"\n\nFor a moment Sir Isaac was baffled. Then he had an inspiration. \"Just\nget me the _Times_, Snagsby,\" he said.\n\nHe took the paper and unfolded it until a particular paragraph was\nthrown into extreme prominence. This he lined about with his fountain\npen and wrote above it with a quivering hand, \"These women's tickets\nwere got by Georgina under false pretences from me.\" He handed the paper\nthus prepared back to Snagsby. \"Just take this paper to Mrs. Sawbridge,\"\nhe said, \"and ask her what she thinks of it?\"\n\nBut Mrs. Sawbridge tacitly declined this proposal for a correspondence\n_vi\u00c3\u00a2_ Snagsby.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a77\n\nThere was no excuse for Georgina.\n\nGeorgina had obtained tickets from Sir Isaac for the great party\nreception at Barleypound House, under the shallow pretext that she\nwanted them for \"two spinsters from the country,\" for whose good\nbehaviour she would answer, and she had handed them over to that\norganization of disorder which swayed her mind. The historical outrage\nupon Mr. Blapton was the consequence.\n\nTwo desperate and misguided emissaries had gone to the great reception,\ndressed and behaving as much as possible like helpful Liberal women;\nthey had made their way towards the brilliant group of leading Liberals\nof which Mr. Blapton was the centre, assuming an almost Whig-like\nexpression and bearing to mask the fires within, and had then suddenly\naccosted him. It was one of those great occasions when the rank and file\nof the popular party is privileged to look upon Court dress. The\nministers and great people had come on from Buckingham Palace in their\nlace and legs. Scarlet and feathers, splendid trains and mysterious\nribbons and stars, gave an agreeable intimation of all that it means to\nbe in office to the dazzled wives and daughters of the party stalwarts\nand fired the ambition of innumerable earnest but earnestly competitive\nyoung men. It opened the eyes of the Labour leaders to the higher\npossibilities of Parliament. And then suddenly came a stir, a rush, a\ncry of \"Tear off his epaulettes!\" and outrage was afoot. And two quite\nnice-looking young women!\n\nIt is unhappily not necessary to describe the scene that followed. Mr.\nBlapton made a brave fight for his epaulettes, fighting chiefly with\nhis cocked hat, which was bent double in the struggle. Mrs. Blapton\ngave all the assistance true womanliness could offer and, in fact, she\nboxed the ears of one of his assailants very soundly. The intruders were\nrescued in an extremely torn and draggled condition from the indignant\nstatesmen who had fallen upon them by tardy but decisive police....\n\nSuch scenes sprinkle the recent history of England with green and purple\npatches and the interest of this particular one for us is only because\nof Georgina's share in it. That was brought home to Sir Isaac, very\nsuddenly and disagreeably, while he was lunching at the Climax Club with\nSir Robert Charterson. A man named Gobbin, an art critic or something of\nthat sort, one of those flimsy literary people who mar the solid worth\nof so many great clubs, a man with a lot of hair and the sort of loose\ntie that so often seems to be less of a tie than a detachment from all\ndecent restraints, told him. Charterson was holding forth upon the\noutrage.\n\n\"That won't suit Sir Isaac, Sir Robert,\" said Gobbin presuming on his\nproximity.\n\nSir Isaac tried to give him a sort of look one gives to an\nunsatisfactory clerk.\n\n\"They went there with Sir Isaac's tickets,\" said Gobbin.\n\n\"They _never_----!\"\n\n\"Horatio Blenker was looking for you in the hall. Haven't you seen him?\nAfter all the care they took. The poor man's almost in tears.\"\n\n\"They never had tickets of mine!\" cried Sir Isaac stoutly and\nindignantly.\n\nAnd then the thought of Georgina came like a blow upon his heart....\n\nIn his flurry he went on denying....\n\nThe subsequent conversation in the smoking-room was as red-eared and\ndisagreeable for Sir Isaac as any conversation could be. \"But how\n_could_ such a thing have happened?\" he asked in a voice that sounded\nbleached to him. \"How could such a thing have come about?\" Their eyes\nwere dreadful. Did they guess? Could they guess? Conscience within him\nwas going up and down shouting out, \"Georgina, your sister-in-law,\nGeorgina,\" so loudly that he felt the whole smoking-room must be hearing\nit....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a78\n\nAs Lady Harman came up through the darkness of the drive to her home,\nshe was already regretting very deeply that she had not been content to\ntalk to Mr. Brumley in Kensington Gardens instead of accepting his\npicturesque suggestion of Hampton Court. There was an unpleasant\nwaif-like feeling about this return. She was reminded of pictures\npublished in the interests of Doctor Barnardo's philanthropies,--Dr.\nBarnardo her favourite hero in real life,--in which wistful little\noutcasts creep longingly towards brightly lit but otherwise respectable\nhomes. It wasn't at all the sort of feeling she would have chosen if she\nhad had a choice of feelings. She was tired and dusty and as she came\ninto the hall the bright light was blinding. Snagsby took her wrap. \"Sir\nIsaac, me lady, 'as been enquiring for your ladyship,\" he communicated.\n\nSir Isaac appeared on the staircase.\n\n\"Good gracious, Elly!\" he shouted. \"Where you been?\"\n\nLady Harman decided against an immediate reply. \"I shall be ready for\ndinner in half an hour,\" she told Snagsby and went past him to the\nstairs.\n\nSir Isaac awaited her. \"Where you been?\" he repeated as she came up to\nhim.\n\nA housemaid on the staircase and the second nursemaid on the nursery\nlanding above shared Sir Isaac's eagerness to hear her answer. But they\ndid not hear her answer, for Lady Harman with a movement that was all\ntoo reminiscent of her mother's in the garden, swept past him towards\nthe door of her own room. He followed her and shut the door on the\nthwarted listeners.\n\n\"Here!\" he said, with a connubial absence of restraint. \"Where the devil\nyou been? What the deuce do you think you've been getting up to?\"\n\nShe had been calculating her answers since the moment she had realized\nthat she was to return home at a disadvantage. (It is not my business to\nblame her for a certain disingenuousness; it is my business simply to\nrecord it.) \"I went out to lunch at Lady Beach-Mandarin's,\" she said. \"I\ntold you I meant to.\"\n\n\"Lunch!\" he cried. \"Why, it's eight!\"\n\n\"I met--some people. I met Agatha Alimony. I have a perfect right to go\nout to lunch----\"\n\n\"You met a nice crew I'll bet. But that don't account for your being out\nto eight, does it? With all the confounded household doing as it\npleases!\"\n\n\"I went on--to see the borders at Hampton Court.\"\n\n\"With _her_?\"\n\n\"_Yes_,\" said Lady Harman....\n\nIt wasn't what she had meant to happen. It was an inglorious declension\nfrom her contemplated pose of dignified assertion. She was impelled to\ndo her utmost to get away from this lie she had uttered at once, to\neliminate Agatha from the argument by an emphatic generalization. \"I've\na perfect right,\" she said, suddenly nearly breathless, \"to go to\nHampton Court with anyone I please, talk about anything I like and stay\nthere as long as I think fit.\"\n\nHe squeezed his thin lips together for a silent moment and then\nretorted. \"You've got nothing of the sort, nothing of the sort. You've\ngot to do your duty like everybody else in the world, and your duty is\nto be in this house controlling it--and not gossiping about London just\nwhere any silly fancy takes you.\"\n\n\"I don't think that _is_ my duty,\" said Lady Harman after a slight pause\nto collect her forces.\n\n\"Of _course_ it's your duty. You know it's your duty. You know perfectly\nwell. It's only these rotten, silly, degenerate, decadent fools who've\ngot ideas into you----\" The sentence staggered under its load of\nadjectives like a camel under the last straw and collapsed. \"_See?_\" he\nsaid.\n\nLady Harman knitted her brows.\n\n\"I do my duty,\" she began.\n\nBut Sir Isaac was now resolved upon eloquence. His mind was full with\nthe accumulations of an extremely long and bitter afternoon and urgent\nto discharge. He began to answer her and then a passion of rage flooded\nhim. Suddenly he wanted to shout and use abusive expressions and it\nseemed to him there was nothing to prevent his shouting and using\nabusive expressions. So he did. \"Call this your duty,\" he said, \"gadding\nabout with some infernal old suffragette----\"\n\nHe paused to gather force. He had never quite let himself go to his wife\nbefore; he had never before quite let himself go to anyone. He had\nalways been in every crisis just a little too timid to let himself go.\nBut a wife is privileged. He sought strength and found it in words from\nwhich he had hitherto abstained. It was not a discourse to which print\ncould do justice; it flickered from issue to issue. He touched upon\nGeorgina, upon the stiffness of Mrs. Sawbridge's manner, upon the\nneurotic weakness of Georgina's unmarried state, upon the general decay\nof feminine virtue in the community, upon the laxity of modern\nliterature, upon the dependent state of Lady Harman, upon the unfairness\nof their relations which gave her every luxury while he spent his days\nin arduous toil, upon the shame and annoyance in the eyes of his\nservants that her unexplained absence had caused him.\n\nHe emphasized his speech by gestures. He thrust out one rather large\nill-shaped hand at her with two vibrating fingers extended. His ears\nbecame red, his nose red, his eyes seemed red and all about these points\nhis face was wrathful white. His hair rose up into stiff scared\nlistening ends. He had his rights, he had some _little_ claim to\nconsideration surely, he might be just nobody but he wasn't going to\nstand this much anyhow. He gave her fair warning. What was she, what did\nshe know of the world into which she wanted to rush? He lapsed into\nviews of Lady Beach-Mandarin--unfavourable views. I wish Lady\nBeach-Mandarin could have heard him....\n\nEver and again Lady Harman sought to speak. This incessant voice\nconfused and baffled her; she had a just attentive mind at bottom and\ndown there was a most weakening feeling that there must indeed be some\nmisdeed in her to evoke so impassioned a storm. She had a curious and\ndisconcerting sense of responsibility for his dancing exasperation, she\nfelt she was to blame for it, just as years ago she had felt she was to\nblame for his tears when he had urged her so desperately to marry him.\nSome irrational instinct made her want to allay him. It is the supreme\nfeminine weakness, that wish to allay. But she was also clinging\ndesperately to her resolution to proclaim her other forthcoming\nengagements. Her will hung on to that as a man hangs on to a mountain\npath in a thunderburst. She stood gripping her dressing-table and ever\nand again trying to speak. But whenever she did so Sir Isaac lifted a\nhand and cried almost threateningly: \"You hear me out, Elly! You hear me\nout!\" and went on a little faster....\n\n(Limburger in his curious \"_Sexuelle Unterschiede der Seele_,\" points\nout as a probably universal distinction between the sexes that when a\nman scolds a woman, if only he scolds loudly enough and long enough,\nconviction of sin is aroused, while in the reverse case the result is\nmerely a murderous impulse. This he further says is not understood by\nwomen, who hope by scolding to produce the similar effect upon men that\nthey themselves would experience. The passage is illustrated by figures\nof ducking stools and followed by some carefully analyzed statistics of\nconnubial crime in Berlin in the years 1901-2. But in this matter let\nthe student compare the achievement of Paulina in _The Winter's Tale_\nand reflect upon his own life. And moreover it is difficult to estimate\nhow far the twinges of conscience that Lady Harman was feeling were not\ndue to an entirely different cause, the falsification of her position by\nthe lie she had just told Sir Isaac.)\n\nAnd presently upon this noisy scene in the great pink bedroom, with Sir\nIsaac walking about and standing and turning and gesticulating and Lady\nHarman clinging on to her dressing-table, and painfully divided between\nher new connections, her sense of guilty deception and the deep\ninstinctive responsibilities of a woman's nature, came, like one of\nthose rows of dots that are now so frequent and so helpful in the art of\nfiction, the surging, deep, assuaging note of Snagsby's gong: Booooooom.\nBoom. Boooooom....\n\n\"Damn it!\" cried Sir Isaac, smiting at the air with both fists clenched\nand speaking as though this was Ellen's crowning misdeed, \"and we aren't\neven dressed for dinner!\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a79\n\nDinner had something of the stiffness of court ceremonial.\n\nMrs. Sawbridge, perhaps erring on the side of discretion, had consumed a\nlittle soup and a wing of chicken in her own room. Sir Isaac was down\nfirst and his wife found him grimly astride before the great dining-room\nfire awaiting her. She had had her dark hair dressed with extreme\nsimplicity and had slipped on a blue velvet tea-gown, but she had been\ndelayed by a visit to the nursery, where the children were now flushed\nand uneasily asleep.\n\nHusband and wife took their places at the genuine Sheraton\ndining-table--one of the very best pieces Sir Isaac had ever picked\nup--and were waited on with a hushed, scared dexterity by Snagsby and\nthe footman.\n\nLady Harman and her husband exchanged no remarks during the meal; Sir\nIsaac was a little noisy with his soup as became a man who controls\nhonest indignation, and once he complained briefly in a slightly hoarse\nvoice to Snagsby about the state of one of the rolls. Between the\ncourses he leant back in his chair and made faint sounds with his teeth.\nThese were the only breach of the velvety quiet. Lady Harman was\nsurprised to discover herself hungry, but she ate with thoughtful\ndignity and gave her mind to the attempted digestion of the confusing\ninterview she had just been through.\n\nIt was a very indigestible interview.\n\nOn the whole her heart hardened again. With nourishment and silence her\nspirit recovered a little from its abasement, and her resolution to\nassert her freedom to go hither and thither and think as she chose\nrenewed itself. She tried to plan some way of making her declaration so\nthat she would not again be overwhelmed by a torrent of response. Should\nshe speak to him at the end of dinner? Should she speak to him while\nSnagsby was in the room? But he might behave badly even with Snagsby in\nthe room and she could not bear to think of him behaving badly to her in\nthe presence of Snagsby. She glanced at him over the genuine old silver\nbowl of roses in the middle of the table--all the roses were good _new_\nsorts--and tried to estimate how he might behave under various methods\nof declaration.\n\nThe dinner followed its appointed ritual to the dessert. Came the wine\nand Snagsby placed the cigars and a little silver lamp beside his\nmaster.\n\nShe rose slowly with a speech upon her lips. Sir Isaac remained seated\nlooking up at her with a mitigated fury in his little red-brown eyes.\n\nThe speech receded from her lips again.\n\n\"I think,\" she said after a strained pause, \"I will go and see how\nmother is now.\"\n\n\"She's only shamming,\" said Sir Isaac belatedly to her back as she went\nout of the room.\n\nShe found her mother in a wrap before her fire and made her dutiful\nenquiries.\n\n\"It's only quite a _slight_ headache,\" Mrs. Sawbridge confessed.\n\"But Isaac was so upset about Georgina and about\"--she\nflinched--\"about--everything, that I thought it better to be out of\nthe way.\"\n\n\"What exactly has Georgina done?\"\n\n\"It's in the paper, dear. On the table there.\"\n\nEllen studied the _Times_.\n\n\"Georgina got them the tickets,\" Mrs. Sawbridge explained. \"I wish she\nhadn't. It was so--so unnecessary of her.\"\n\nThere was a little pause as Lady Harman read. She put down the paper and\nasked her mother if she could do anything for her.\n\n\"I--I suppose it's all Right, dear, now?\" Mrs. Sawbridge asked.\n\n\"Quite,\" said her daughter. \"You're sure I can do nothing for you,\nmummy?\"\n\n\"I'm kept so in the dark about things.\"\n\n\"It's quite all right now, mummy.\"\n\n\"He went on--dreadfully.\"\n\n\"It was annoying--of Georgina.\"\n\n\"It makes my position so difficult. I do wish he wouldn't want to speak\nto me--about all these things.... Georgina treats me like a Perfect\nNonentity and then he comes----It's so inconsiderate. Starting Disputes.\nDo you know, dear, I really think--if I were to go for a little time to\nBournemouth----?\"\n\nHer daughter seemed to find something attractive in the idea. She came\nto the hearthrug and regarded her mother with maternal eyes.\n\n\"Don't you _worry_ about things, mummy,\" she said.\n\n\"Mrs. Bleckhorn told me of such a nice quiet boarding-house, almost\nlooking on the sea.... One would be safe from Insult there. You\nknow----\" her voice broke for a moment, \"he was Insulting, he _meant_ to\nbe Insulting. I'm--Upset. I've been thinking over it ever since.\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a710\n\nLady Harman came out upon the landing. She felt absolutely without\nbacking in the world. (If only she hadn't told a lie!) Then with an\neffort she directed her course downstairs to the dining-room.\n\n(The lie had been necessary. It was only a detail. It mustn't blind her\nto the real issue.)\n\nShe entered softly and found her husband standing before the fire\nplunged in gloomy thoughts. Upon the marble mantel-shelf behind him was\na little glass; he had been sipping port in spite of the express\nprohibition of his doctor and the wine had reddened the veins of his\neyes and variegated the normal pallor of his countenance with little\nflushed areas. \"Hel-lo,\" he said looking up suddenly as she closed the\ndoor behind her.\n\nFor a moment there was something in their two expressions like that on\nthe faces of men about to box.\n\n\"I want you to understand,\" she said, and then; \"The way you\nbehaved----\"\n\nThere was an uncontrollable break in her voice. She had a dreadful\nfeeling that she might be going to cry. She made a great effort to be\ncold and clear.\n\n\"I don't think you have a right--just because I am your wife--to control\nevery moment of my time. In fact you haven't. And I have a right to make\nengagements.... I want you to know I am going to an afternoon meeting at\nLady Beach-Mandarin's. Next week. And I have promised to go to Miss\nAlimony's to tea.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" he encouraged grimly.\n\n\"I am going to Lady Viping's to dinner, too; she asked me and I\naccepted. Later.\"\n\nShe stopped.\n\nHe seemed to deliberate. Then suddenly he thrust out a face of pinched\ndetermination.\n\n\"You _won't_, my lady,\" he said. \"You bet your life you won't. _No!_ So\n_now_ then!\"\n\nAnd then gripping his hands more tightly behind him, he made a step\ntowards her.\n\n\"You're losing your bearings, Lady Harman,\" he said, speaking with much\nintensity in a low earnest voice. \"You don't seem to be remembering\nwhere you are. You come and you tell me you're going to do this and\nthat. Don't you know, Lady Harman, that it's your wifely duty to obey,\nto do as I say, to behave as I wish?\" He brought out a lean index finger\nto emphasize his remarks. \"And I am going to make you do it!\" he said.\n\n\"I've a perfect right,\" she repeated.\n\nHe went on, regardless of her words. \"What do you think you can do, Lady\nHarman? You're going to all these places--how? Not in _my_ motor-car,\nnot with _my_ money. You've not a thing that isn't mine, that _I_\nhaven't given you. And if you're going to have a lot of friends I\nhaven't got, where're they coming to see you? Not in _my_ house! I'll\nchuck 'em out if I find 'em. I won't have 'em. I'll turn 'em out. See?\"\n\n\"I'm not a slave.\"\n\n\"You're a wife--and a wife's got to do what her husband wishes. You\ncan't have two heads on a horse. And in _this_ horse--this house I mean,\nthe head's--_me_!\"\n\n\"I'm not a slave and I won't be a slave.\"\n\n\"You're a wife and you'll stick to the bargain you made when you married\nme. I'm ready in reason to give you anything you want--if you do your\nduty as a wife should. Why!--I spoil you. But this going about on your\nown, this highty-flighty go-as-you-please,--no man on earth who's worth\ncalling a man will stand it. I'm not going to begin to stand it.... You\ntry it on. You try it, Lady Harman.... You'll come to your senses soon\nenough. See? You start trying it on now--straight away. We'll make an\nexperiment. We'll watch how it goes. Only don't expect me to give you\nany money, don't expect me to help your struggling family, don't expect\nme to alter my arrangements because of you. Let's keep apart for a bit\nand you go your way and I'll go mine. And we'll see who's sick of it\nfirst, we'll see who wants to cry off.\"\n\n\"I came down here,\" said Lady Harman, \"to give you a reasonable\nnotice----\"\n\n\"And you found _I_ could reason too,\" interrupted Sir Isaac in a kind of\nminiature shout, \"you found I could reason too!\"\n\n\"You think----Reason! I _won't_,\" said Lady Harman, and found herself in\ntears. By an enormous effort she recovered something of her dignity and\nwithdrew. He made no effort to open the door, but stood a little\nhunchbacked and with a sense of rhetorical victory surveying her\nretreat.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a711\n\nAfter Lady Harman's maid had left her that night, she sat for some time\nin a low easy chair before her fire, trying at first to collect together\ninto one situation all the events of the day and then lapsing into that\nstate of mind which is not so much thinking as resting in the attitude\nof thought. Presently, in a vaguely conceived future, she would go to\nbed. She was stunned by the immense dimensions of the row her simple act\nof defiance had evoked.\n\nAnd then came an incredible incident, so incredible that next day she\nstill had great difficulty in deciding whether it was an actuality or a\ndream. She heard a little very familiar sound. It was the last sound she\nwould have expected to hear and she turned sharply when she heard it.\nThe paper-covered door in the wall of her husband's apartment opened\nsoftly, paused, opened some more and his little undignified head\nappeared. His hair was already tumbled from his pillow.\n\nHe regarded her steadfastly for some moments with an expression between\nshame and curiosity and smouldering rage, and then allowed his body,\nclad now in purple-striped pyjamas, to follow his head into her room. He\nadvanced guiltily.\n\n\"Elly,\" he whispered. \"Elly!\"\n\nShe caught her dressing-gown about her and stood up.\n\n\"What is it, Isaac?\" she asked, feeling curiously abashed at this\ninvasion.\n\n\"Elly,\" he said, still in that furtive undertone. \"_Make it up!_\"\n\n\"I want my freedom,\" she said, after a little pause.\n\n\"Don't be _silly_, Elly,\" he whispered in a tone of remonstrance and\nadvancing slowly towards her. \"Make it up. Chuck all these ideas.\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"We've got to get along together. You can't go going about just\nanywhere. We've got--we've got to be reasonable.\"\n\nHe halted, three paces away from her. His eyes weren't sorrowful eyes,\nor friendly eyes; they were just shiftily eager eyes. \"Look here,\" he\nsaid. \"It's all nonsense.... Elly, old girl; let's--let's make it up.\"\n\nShe looked at him and it dawned upon her that she had always imagined\nherself to be afraid of him and that indeed she wasn't. She shook her\nhead obstinately.\n\n\"It isn't reasonable,\" he said. \"Here, we've been the happiest of\npeople----Anything in reason I'll let you have.\" He paused with an\neffect of making an offer.\n\n\"I want my autonomy,\" she said.\n\n\"Autonomy!\" he echoed. \"Autonomy! What's autonomy? Autonomy!\"\n\nThis strange word seemed first to hold him in distressful suspense and\nthen to infuriate him.\n\n\"I come in here to make it up,\" he said, with a voice charged with\ngriefs, \"after all you've done, and you go and you talk of autonomy!\"\n\nHis feelings passed beyond words. An extremity of viciousness flashed\ninto his face. He gave vent to a snarl of exasperation, \"Ya-ap!\" he\nsaid, he raised his clenched fists and seemed on the verge of assault,\nand then with a gesture between fury and despair, he wheeled about and\nthe purple-striped pyjamas danced in passionate retreat from her room.\n\n\"Autonomy!...\"\n\nA slam, a noise of assaulted furniture, and then silence.\n\nLady Harman stood for some moments regarding the paper-covered door that\nhad closed behind him. Then she bared her white forearm and pinched\nit--hard.\n\nIt wasn't a dream! This thing had happened.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a712\n\nAt a quarter to three in the morning, Lady Harman was surprised to find\nherself wide awake. It was exactly a quarter to three when she touched\nthe stud of the ingenious little silver apparatus upon the table beside\nher bed which reflected a luminous clock-face upon the ceiling. And her\nmind was no longer resting in the attitude of thought but\nextraordinarily active. It was active, but as she presently began to\nrealize it was not progressing. It was spinning violently round and\nround the frenzied figure of a little man in purple-striped pyjamas\nretreating from her presence, whirling away from her like something\nblown before a gale. That seemed to her to symbolize the completeness of\nthe breach the day had made between her husband and herself.\n\nShe felt as a statesman might feel who had inadvertently--while\nconducting some trivial negotiations--declared war.\n\nShe was profoundly alarmed. She perceived ahead of her abundant\npossibilities of disagreeable things. And she wasn't by any means as\nconvinced of the righteousness of her cause as a happy warrior should\nbe. She had a natural disposition towards truthfulness and it worried\nher mind that while she was struggling to assert her right to these\ncommon social freedoms she should be tacitly admitting a kind of justice\nin her husband's objections by concealing the fact that her afternoon's\ncompanion was a man. She tried not to recognize the existence of a\ndoubt, but deep down in her mind there did indeed lurk a weakening\nuncertainty about the right of a woman to free conversation with any man\nbut her own. Her reason disowned that uncertainty with scorn. But it\nwouldn't go away for all her reason. She went about in her mind doing\nher utmost to cut that doubt dead....\n\nShe tried to go back to the beginning and think it all out. And as she\nwas not used to thinking things out, the effort took the form of an\nimaginary explanation to Mr. Brumley of the difficulties of her\nposition. She framed phrases. \"You see, Mr. Brumley,\" she imagined\nherself to be saying, \"I want to do my duty as a wife, I have to do my\nduty as a wife. But it's so hard to say just where duty leaves off and\nbeing a mere slave begins. I cannot believe that _blind_ obedience is\nany woman's duty. A woman needs--autonomy.\" Then her mind went off for a\ntime to a wrestle with the exact meaning of autonomy, an issue that had\nnot arisen hitherto in her mind.... And as she planned out such\nelucidations, there grew more and more distinct in her mind a kind of\nidealized Mr. Brumley, very grave, very attentive, wonderfully\nunderstanding, saying illuminating helpful tonic things, that made\neverything clear, everything almost easy. She wanted someone of that\nquality so badly. The night would have been unendurable if she could not\nhave imagined Mr. Brumley of that quality. And imagining him of that\nquality her heart yearned for him. She felt that she had been terribly\ninexpressive that afternoon, she had shirked points, misstated points,\nand yet he had been marvellously understanding. Ever and again his words\nhad seemed to pierce right through what she had been saying to what she\nhad been thinking. And she recalled with peculiar comfort a kind of\nabstracted calculating look that had come at times into his eyes, as\nthough his thoughts were going ever so much deeper and ever so much\nfurther than her blundering questionings could possibly have taken them.\nHe weighed every word, he had a guarded way of saying \"Um....\"\n\nHer thoughts came back to the dancing little figure in purple-striped\npyjamas. She had a scared sense of irrevocable breaches. What would he\ndo to-morrow? What should she do to-morrow? Would he speak to her at\nbreakfast or should she speak first to him?... She wished she had some\nmoney. If she could have foreseen all this she would have got some money\nbefore she began....\n\nSo her mind went on round and round and the dawn was breaking before she\nslept again.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a713\n\nMr. Brumley, also, slept little that night. He was wakefully mournful,\nrecalling each ungraceful incident of the afternoon's failure in turn\nand more particularly his dispute with the ticket clerk, and thinking\nover all the things he might have done--if only he hadn't done the\nthings he had done. He had made an atrocious mess of things. He felt he\nhad hopelessly shattered the fair fabric of impressions of him that Lady\nHarman had been building up, that image of a wise humane capable man to\nwhom a woman would gladly turn; he had been flurried, he had been\nincompetent, he had been ridiculously incompetent, and it seemed to him\nthat life was a string of desolating inadequacies and that he would\nnever smile again.\n\nThe probable reception of Lady Harman by her husband never came within\nhis imaginative scope. Nor did the problems of social responsibility\nthat Lady Harman had been trying to put to him exercise him very\ngreatly. The personal disillusionment was too strong for that.\n\nAbout half-past four a faint ray of comfort came with the consideration\nthat after all a certain practical incapacity is part of the ensemble of\na literary artist, and then he found himself wondering what flowers of\nwisdom Montaigne might not have culled from such a day's experience; he\nbegan an imitative essay in his head and he fell asleep upon this at\nlast at about ten minutes past five in the morning.\n\nThere were better things than this in the composition of Mr. Brumley, we\nshall have to go deep into these reserves before we have done with him,\nbut when he had so recently barked the shins of his self-esteem they had\nno chance at all.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE SEVENTH\n\nLADY HARMAN LEARNS ABOUT HERSELF\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a71\n\nSo it was that the great and long incubated quarrel between Lady Harman\nand her husband broke into active hostilities.\n\nIn spite of my ill-concealed bias in favour of Lady Harman I have to\nconfess that she began this conflict rashly, planlessly, with no\nequipment and no definite end. Particularly I would emphasize that she\nhad no definite end. She had wanted merely to establish a right to go\nout by herself occasionally, exercise a certain choice of friends, take\non in fact the privileges of a grown-up person, and in asserting that\nshe had never anticipated that the participation of the household would\nbe invoked, or that a general breach might open between herself and her\nhusband. It had seemed just a definite little point at issue, but at Sir\nIsaac's angry touch a dozen other matters that had seemed safely remote,\nmatters she had never yet quite properly thought about, had been drawn\ninto controversy. It was not only that he drew in things from outside;\nhe evoked things within herself. She discovered she was disposed to\nfight not simply to establish certain liberties for herself but\nalso--which had certainly not been in her mind before--to keep her\nhusband away from herself. Something latent in the situation had\nsurprised her with this effect. It had arisen out of the quarrel like a\nsharpshooter out of an ambuscade. Her right to go out alone had now only\nthe value of a mere pretext for far more extensive independence. The\nultimate extent of these independences, she still dared not contemplate.\n\nShe was more than a little scared. She wasn't prepared for so wide a\nrevision of her life as this involved. She wasn't at all sure of the\nrightfulness of her position. Her conception of the marriage contract at\nthat time was liberal towards her husband. After all, didn't she owe\nobedience? Didn't she owe him a subordinate's co-operation? Didn't she\nin fact owe him the whole marriage service contract? When she thought of\nthe figure of him in his purple-striped pyjamas dancing in a paroxysm of\nexasperation, that sense of responsibility which was one of her innate\ncharacteristics reproached her. She had a curious persuasion that she\nmust be dreadfully to blame for provoking so ridiculous, so extravagant\nan outbreak....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a72\n\nShe heard him getting up tumultuously and when she came down,--after a\nbrief interview with her mother who was still keeping her room,--she\nfound him sitting at the breakfast-table eating toast and marmalade in\na greedy malignant manner. The tentative propitiations of his proposal\nto make things up had entirely disappeared, he was evidently in a far\nprofounder rage with her than he had been overnight. Snagsby too, that\nseemly domestic barometer, looked extraordinarily hushed and grave. She\nmade a greeting-like noise and Sir Isaac scrunched \"morning\" up amongst\na crowded fierce mouthful of toast. She helped herself to tea and bacon\nand looking up presently discovered his eye fixed upon her with an\nexpression of ferocious hatred....\n\nHe went off in the big car, she supposed to London, about ten and she\nhelped her mother to pack and depart by a train a little after midday.\nShe made a clumsy excuse for not giving that crisp little trifle of\nfinancial assistance she was accustomed to, and Mrs. Sawbridge was\nanxiously tactful about the disappointment. They paid a visit of\ninspection and farewell to the nursery before the departure. Then Lady\nHarman was left until lunch to resume her meditation upon this\nunprecedented breach that had opened between her husband and herself.\nShe was presently moved to write a little note to Lady Beach-Mandarin\nexpressing her intention of attending a meeting of the Social Friends\nand asking whether the date was the following Wednesday or Thursday. She\nfound three penny stamps in the bureau at which she wrote and this\nserved to remind her of her penniless condition. She spent some time\nthinking out the possible consequences of that. How after all was she\ngoing to do things, with not a penny in the world to do them with?\n\nLady Harman was not only instinctively truthful but also almost morbidly\nhonourable. In other words, she was simple-minded. The idea of a\ncommunity of goods between husband and wife had never established itself\nin her mind, she took all Sir Isaac's presents in the spirit in which he\ngave them, presents she felt they were on trust, and so it was that with\na six-hundred pound pearl necklace, a diamond tiara, bracelets, lockets,\nrings, chains and pendants of the most costly kind--there had been a\nparticularly beautiful bracelet when Millicent was born, a necklace on\naccount of Florence, a fan painted by Charles Conder for Annette and a\nrichly splendid set of old Spanish jewellery--yellow sapphires set in\ngold--to express Sir Isaac's gratitude for the baby--with all sorts of\npurses, bags, boxes, trinkets and garments, with a bedroom and\nmorning-room rich in admirable loot, and with endless tradespeople\nwilling to give her credit it didn't for some time occur to her that\nthere was any possible means of getting pocket-money except by direct\ndemand from Sir Isaac. She surveyed her balance of two penny stamps and\neven about these she felt a certain lack of negotiable facility.\n\nShe thought indeed that she might perhaps borrow money, but there again\nher paralyzing honesty made her recoil from the prospect of uncertain\nrepayment. And besides, from whom could she borrow?...\n\nIt was on the evening of the second day that a chance remark from\nPeters turned her mind to the extensive possibilities of liquidation\nthat lay close at hand. She was discussing her dinner dress with Peters,\nshe wanted something very plain and high and unattractive, and Peters,\nwho disapproved of this tendency and was all for female wiles and\npropitiations, fell into an admiration of the pearl necklace. She\nthought perhaps by so doing she might induce Lady Harman to wear it, and\nif she wore it Sir Isaac might be a little propitiated, and if Sir Isaac\nwas a little propitiated it would be much more comfortable for Snagsby\nand herself and everyone. She was reminded of a story of a lady who sold\none and substituted imitation pearls, no one the wiser, and she told\nthis to her mistress out of sheer garrulousness. \"But if no one found\nout,\" said Lady Harman, \"how do you know?\"\n\n\"Not till her death, me lady,\" said Peters, brushing, \"when all things\nare revealed. Her husband, they say, made it a present of to another\nlady and the other lady, me lady, had it valued....\"\n\nOnce the idea had got into Lady Harman's head it stayed there very\nobstinately. She surveyed the things on the table before her with a\nslightly lifted eyebrow. At first she thought the idea of disposing of\nthem an entirely dishonourable idea, and if she couldn't get it out of\nher head again at least she made it stand in a corner. And while it\nstood in a corner she began putting a price for the first time in her\nlife first upon this coruscating object and then that. Then somehow she\nfound herself thinking more and more whether among all these glittering\npossessions there wasn't something that she might fairly regard as\nabsolutely her own. There were for example her engagement ring and,\nstill more debateable, certain other pre-nuptial trinkets Sir Isaac had\ngiven her. Then there were things given her on her successive birthdays.\nA birthday present of all presents is surely one's very own? But selling\nis an extreme exercise of ownership. Since those early schooldays when\nshe had carried on an unprofitable traffic in stamps she had never sold\nanything--unless we are to reckon that for once and for all she had sold\nherself.\n\nConcurrently with these insidious speculations Lady Harman found herself\ntrying to imagine how one sold jewels. She tried to sound Peters by\ntaking up the story of the necklace again. But Peters was uninforming.\n\"But where,\" asked Lady Harman, \"could such a thing be done?\"\n\n\"There are places, me lady,\" said Peters.\n\n\"But where?\"\n\n\"In the West End, me lady. The West End is full of places--for things of\nthat sort. There's scarcely anything you can't do there, me lady--if\nonly you know how.\"\n\nThat was really all that Peters could impart.\n\n\"How _does_ one sell jewels?\" Lady Harman became so interested in this\nside of her perplexities that she did a little lose sight of those\nsubtler problems of integrity that had at first engaged her. Do\njewellers buy jewels as well as sell them? And then it came into her\nhead that there were such things as pawnshops. By the time she had\nthought about pawnshops and tried to imagine one, her original complete\nveto upon any idea of selling had got lost to sight altogether. Instead\nthere was a growing conviction that if ever she sold anything it would\nbe a certain sapphire and diamond ring which she didn't like and never\nwore that Sir Isaac had given her as a birthday present two years ago.\nBut of course she would never dream of selling anything; at the utmost\nshe need but pawn. She reflected and decided that on the whole it would\nbe wiser not to ask Peters how one pawned. It occurred to her to consult\nthe _Encyclop\u00c3\u00a6dia Britannica_ on the subject, but though she learnt that\nthe Chinese pawnshops must not charge more than three per cent. per\nannum, that King Edward the Third pawned his jewels in 1338 and that\nFather Bernardino di Feltre who set up pawnshops in Assisi and Padua and\nPavia was afterward canonized, she failed to get any very clear idea of\nthe exact ritual of the process. And then suddenly she remembered that\nshe knew a finished expert in pawnshop work in the person of Susan\nBurnet. Susan could tell her everything. She found some curtains in the\nstudy that needed replacement, consulted Mrs. Crumble and, with a view\nto economizing her own resources, made that lady send off an urgent\nletter to Susan bidding her come forthwith.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a73\n\nIt has been said that Fate is a plagiarist. Lady Harman's Fate at any\nrate at this juncture behaved like a benevolent plagiarist who was also\na little old-fashioned. This phase of speechless hostility was\ncomplicated by the fact that two of the children fell ill, or at least\nseemed for a couple of days to be falling ill. By all the rules of\nBritish sentiment, this ought to have brought about a headlong\nreconciliation at the tumbled bedside. It did nothing of the sort; it\nmerely wove fresh perplexities into the tangled skein of her thoughts.\n\nOn the day after her participation in that forbidden lunch Millicent,\nher eldest daughter, was discovered with a temperature of a hundred and\none, and then Annette, the third, followed suit with a hundred. This\ncarried Lady Harman post haste to the nursery, where to an unprecedented\ndegree she took command. Latterly she had begun to mistrust the physique\nof her children and to doubt whether the trained efficiency of Mrs.\nHarblow the nurse wasn't becoming a little blunted at the edges by\ncontinual use. And the tremendous quarrel she had afoot made her keenly\nresolved not to let anything go wrong in the nursery and less disposed\nthan she usually was to leave things to her husband's servants. She\ninterviewed the doctor herself, arranged for the isolation of the two\nflushed and cross little girls, saw to the toys and amusements which she\ndiscovered had become a little flattened and disused by the servants'\nimperatives of tidying up and putting away, and spent the greater part\nof the next two days between the night and day nurseries.\n\nShe was a little surprised to find how readily she did this and how\neasily the once entirely authoritative Mrs. Harblow submitted. It was\nmuch the same surprise that growing young people feel when they reach\nsome shelf that has hitherto been inaccessible. The crisis soon passed.\nAt his first visit the doctor was a little doubtful whether the Harman\nnursery wasn't under the sway of measles, which were then raging in a\nparticularly virulent form in London; the next day he inclined to the\nview that the trouble was merely a feverish cold, and before night this\nsecond view was justified by the disappearance of the \"temperatures\" and\na complete return to normal conditions.\n\nBut as for that hushed reconciliation in the fevered presence of the\nalmost sacrificial offspring, it didn't happen. Sir Isaac merely thrust\naside the stiff silences behind which he masked his rage to remark:\n\"This is what happens when wimmen go gadding about!\"\n\nThat much and glaring eyes and compressed lips and emphasizing fingers\nand then he had gone again.\n\nIndeed rather than healing their widening breach this crisis did much to\nspread it into strange new regions. It brought Lady Harman to the very\nverge of realizing how much of instinct and how much of duty held her\nthe servant of the children she had brought into the world, and how\nlittle there mingled with that any of those factors of pride and\nadmiration that go to the making of heroic maternal love. She knew what\nis expected of a mother, the exalted and lyrical devotion, and it was\nwith something approaching terror that she perceived that certain things\nin these children of hers she _hated_. It was her business she knew to\nlove them blindly; she lay awake at night in infinite dismay realizing\nshe did nothing of the sort. Their weakness held her more than anything\nelse, the invincible pathos of their little limbs in discomfort so that\nshe was ready to die she felt to give them ease. But so she would have\nbeen held, she was assured, by the little children of anybody if they\nhad fallen with sufficient helplessness into her care.\n\nJust how much she didn't really like her children she presently realized\nwhen in the feeble irascibility of their sickness they fell quarrelling.\nThey became--horrid. Millicent and Annette being imprisoned in their\nbeds it seemed good to Florence when she came back from the morning's\nwalk, to annex and hide a selection of their best toys. She didn't take\nthem and play with them, she hid them with an industrious earnestness in\na box window-seat that was regarded as peculiarly hers, staggering with\narmfuls across the nursery floor. Then Millicent by some equally\nmysterious agency divined what was afoot and set up a clamour for a\nvalued set of doll's furniture, which immediately provoked a similar\noutcry from little Annette for her Teddy Bear. Followed woe and uproar.\nThe invalids insisted upon having every single toy they possessed\nbrought in and put upon their beds; Florence was first disingenuous and\nthen surrendered her loot with passionate howlings. The Teddy Bear was\nrescued from Baby after a violent struggle in which one furry hind leg\nwas nearly twisted off. It jars upon the philoprogenitive sentiment of\nour time to tell of these things and still more to record that all four,\nstirred by possessive passion to the profoundest depths of their beings,\nbetrayed to an unprecedented degree in their little sharp noses, their\nflushed faces, their earnest eyes, their dutiful likeness to Sir Isaac.\nHe peeped from under Millicent's daintily knitted brows and gestured\nwith Florence's dimpled fists. It was as if God had tried to make him\ninto four cherubim and as if in spite of everything he was working\nthrough.\n\nLady Harman toiled to pacify these disorders, gently, attentively, and\nwith a faint dismay in her dark eyes. She bribed and entreated and\nmarvelled at mental textures so unlike her own. Baby was squared with a\nbrand new Teddy Bear, a rare sort, a white one, which Snagsby went and\npurchased in the Putney High Street and brought home in his arms,\nconferring such a lustre upon the deed that the lower orders, the very\nstreet-boys, watched him with reverence as he passed. Annette went to\nsleep amidst a discomfort of small treasures and woke stormily when Mrs.\nHarblow tried to remove some of the spikier ones. And Lady Harman went\nback to her large pink bedroom and meditated for a long time upon these\nthings and tried to remember whether in her own less crowded childhood\nwith Georgina, either of them had been quite so inhumanly hard and\ngrasping as these feverish little mites in her nursery. She tried to\nthink she had been, she tried to think that all children were such\nlittle distressed lumps of embittered individuality, and she did what\nshe could to overcome the queer feeling that this particular clutch of\noffspring had been foisted upon her and weren't at all the children she\ncould now imagine and desire,--gentle children, sweet-spirited\nchildren....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a74\n\nSusan Burnet arrived in a gusty mood and brought new matter for Lady\nHarman's ever broadening consideration of the wifely position. Susan,\nled by a newspaper placard, had discovered Sir Isaac's relations to the\nInternational Bread and Cake Stores.\n\n\"At first I thought I wouldn't come,\" said Susan. \"I really did. I\ncouldn't hardly believe it. And then I thought, 'it isn't _her_. It\ncan't be _her_!' But I'd never have dreamt before that I could have been\nbrought to set foot in the house of the man who drove poor father to\nruin and despair.... You've been so kind to me....\"\n\nSusan's simple right-down mind stopped for a moment with something very\nlike a sob, baffled by the contradictions of the situation.\n\n\"So I came,\" she said, with a forced bright smile.\n\n\"I'm glad you came,\" said Lady Harman. \"I wanted to see you. And you\nknow, Susan, I know very little--very little indeed--of Sir Isaac's\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"I quite believe it, my lady. I've never for one moment thought\n_you_----I don't know how to say it, my lady.\"\n\n\"And indeed I'm not,\" said Lady Harman, taking it as said.\n\n\"I knew you weren't,\" said Susan, relieved to be so understood.\n\nAnd the two women looked perplexedly at one another over the neglected\ncurtains Susan had come to \"see to,\" and shyness just snatched back Lady\nHarman from her impulse to give Susan a sisterly kiss. Nevertheless\nSusan who was full of wise intuitions felt that kiss that was never\ngiven, and in the remote world of unacted deeds returned it with\neffusion.\n\n\"But it's hard,\" said Susan, \"to find one's own second sister mixed up\nin a strike, and that's what it's come to last week. They've struck, all\nthe International waitresses have struck, and last night in Piccadilly\nthey were standing on the kerb and picketing and her among them. With a\ncrowd cheering.... And me ready to give my right hand to keep that girl\nrespectable!\"\n\nAnd with a volubility that was at once tumultuous and effective, Susan\nsketched in the broad outlines of the crisis that threatened the\ndividends and popularity of the International Bread and Cake Stores.\nThe unsatisfied demands of that bright journalistic enterprise, _The\nLondon Lion_, lay near the roots of the trouble. _The London Lion_ had\nstirred it up. But it was only too evident that _The London Lion_ had\nmerely given a voice and form and cohesion to long smouldering\ndiscontents.\n\nSusan's account of the matter had that impartiality which comes from\nintellectual incoherence, she hadn't so much a judgment upon the whole\nas a warring mosaic of judgments. It was talking upon Post Impressionist\nlines, talking in the manner of Picasso. She had the firmest conviction\nthat to strike against employment, however ill-paid or badly\nconditioned, was a disgraceful combination of folly, ingratitude and\ngeneral wickedness, and she had an equally strong persuasion that the\ntreatment of the employees of the International Bread and Cake Stores\nwas such as no reasonably spirited person ought to stand. She blamed her\nsister extremely and sympathized with her profoundly, and she put it all\ndown in turn to _The London Lion_, to Sir Isaac, and to a small\nround-faced person called Babs Wheeler, who appeared to be the strike\nleader and seemed always to be standing on tables in the branches, or\nclambering up to the lions in Trafalgar Square, or being cheered in the\nstreets.\n\nBut there could be no mistaking the quality of Sir Isaac's\n\"International\" organization as Susan's dabs of speech shaped it out. It\nwas indeed what we all of us see everywhere about us, the work of the\nbase energetic mind, raw and untrained, in possession of the keen\ninstruments of civilization, the peasant mind allied and blended with\nthe Ghetto mind, grasping and acquisitive, clever as a Norman peasant or\na Jew pedlar is clever, and beyond that outrageously stupid and ugly. It\nwas a new view and yet the old familiar view of her husband, but now she\nsaw him not as little eager eyes, a sharp nose, gaunt gestures and a\nleaden complexion, but as shops and stores and rules and cash registers\nand harsh advertisements and a driving merciless hurry to get--to get\nanything and everything, money, monopoly, power, prominence, whatever\nany other human being seemed to admire or seemed to find desirable, a\nlust rather than a living soul. Now that her eyes were at last opened\nLady Harman, who had seen too little heretofore, now saw too much; she\nsaw all that she had not seen, with an excess of vision, monstrous,\ncaricatured. Susan had already dabbed in the disaster of Sir Isaac's\nunorganized competitors going to the wall--for charity or the state to\nneglect or bandage as it might chance--the figure of that poor little\n\"Father,\" moping hopelessly before his \"accident\" symbolized that; and\nnow she gave in vivid splotches of allusion, glimpses of the business\nmachine that had replaced those shattered enterprises and carried Sir\nIsaac to the squalid glory of a Liberal honours list,--the carefully\nbalanced antagonisms and jealousies of the girls and the manageresses,\nthose manageresses who had been obliged to invest little bunches of\nsavings as guarantees and who had to account for every crumb and\nparticle of food stock that came to the branch, and the hunt for cases\nand inefficiency by the inspectors, who had somehow to justify a salary\nof two hundred a year, not to mention a percentage of the fines they\ninflicted.\n\n\"There's all that business of the margarine,\" said Susan. \"Every branch\ngets its butter under weight,--the water squeezes out,--and every branch\nhas over weight margarine. Of course the rules say that mixing's\nforbidden and if they get caught they go, but they got to pay-in for\nthat butter, and it's setting a snare for their feet. People who've\nnever thought to cheat, when they get it like that, day after day, they\ncheat, my lady.... And the girls get left food for rations. There's\nalways trouble, it's against what the rules say, but they get it. Of\ncourse it's against the rules, but what can a manageress do?--if the\nwaste doesn't fall on them, it falls on her. She's tied there with her\nsavings.... Such driving, my lady, it's against the very spirit of God.\nIt makes scoffers point. It makes people despise law and order. There's\nLuke, he gets bitterer and bitterer; he says that it's in the Word we\nmustn't muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn, but these Stores, he\nsays, they'd muzzle the ox and keep it hungry and make it work a little\nmachine, he says, whenever it put down its head in the hope of finding a\nscrap....\"\n\nSo Susan, bright-eyed, flushed and voluble, pleading the cause of that\nvague greatness in humanity that would love, that would loiter, that\nwould think, that would if it could give us art, delight and beauty,\nthat turns blindly and stumblingly towards joy, towards intervals,\ntowards the mysterious things of the spirit, against all this sordid\nstrenuousness, this driving destructive association of hardfisted\npeasant soul and Ghetto greed, this fool's \"efficiency,\" that rules our\nworld to-day.\n\nThen Susan lunged for a time at the waitress life her sister led. \"She\nhas 'er 'ome with us, but some--they haven't homes.\"\n\n\"They make a fuss about all this White Slave Traffic,\" said Susan, \"but\nif ever there were white slaves it's the girls who work for a living and\nkeep themselves respectable. And nobody wants to make an example of the\nmen who get rich out of _them_....\"\n\nAnd after some hearsay about the pressure in the bake-houses and the\naccidents to the van-men, who worked on a speeding-up system that Sir\nIsaac had adopted from an American business specialist, Susan's mental\ndischarge poured out into the particulars of the waitresses' strike and\nher sister's share in that. \"She _would_ go into it,\" said Susan, \"she\nlet herself be drawn in. I asked her never to take the place. Better\nService, I said, a thousand times. I begged her, I could have begged her\non my bended knees....\"\n\nThe immediate cause of the strike it seemed was the exceptional\ndisagreeableness of one of the London district managers. \"He takes\nadvantage of his position,\" repeated Susan with face aflame, and Lady\nHarman was already too wise about Susan's possibilities to urge her\ntowards particulars....\n\nNow as Lady Harman listened to all this confused effective picturing of\nthe great catering business which was the other side of her husband and\nwhich she had taken on trust so long, she had in her heart a quite\nunreasonable feeling of shame that she should listen at all, a shyness,\nas though she was prying, as though this really did not concern her. She\nknew she had to listen and still she felt beyond her proper\njurisdiction. It is against instinct, it is with an enormous reluctance\nthat women are bringing their quick emotions, their flashing unstable\nintelligences, their essential romanticism, their inevitable profound\ngenerosity into the world of politics and business. If only they could\ncontinue believing that all that side of life is grave and wise and\nadmirably managed for them they would. It is not in a day or a\ngeneration that we shall un-specialize women. It is a wrench nearly as\nviolent as birth for them to face out into the bleak realization that\nthe man who goes out for them into business, into affairs, and returns\nso comfortably loaded with housings and wrappings and trappings and\ntoys, isn't, as a matter of fact, engaged in benign creativeness while\nhe is getting these desirable things.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a75\n\nLady Harman's mind was so greatly exercised by Susan Burnet's voluminous\nconfidences that it was only when she returned to her own morning room\nthat she recalled the pawning problem. She went back to Sir Isaac's\nstudy and found Susan with all her measurements taken and on the very\nedge of departure.\n\n\"Oh Susan!\" she said.\n\nShe found the matter a little difficult to broach. Susan remained in an\nattitude of respectful expectation.\n\n\"I wanted to ask you,\" said Lady Harman and then broke off to shut the\ndoor. Susan's interest increased.\n\n\"You know, Susan,\" said Lady Harman with an air of talking about\ncommonplace things, \"Sir Isaac is very rich and--of course--very\ngenerous.... But sometimes one feels, one wants a little money of one's\nown.\"\n\n\"I think I can understand that, my lady,\" said Susan.\n\n\"I knew you would,\" said Lady Harman and then with a brightness that was\nslightly forced, \"I can't always get money of my own. It's\ndifficult--sometimes.\"\n\nAnd then blushing vividly: \"I've got lots of _things_.... Susan, have\nyou ever pawned anything?\"\n\nAnd so she broached it.\n\n\"Not since I got fairly into work,\" said Susan; \"I wouldn't have it. But\nwhen I was little we were always pawning things. Why! we've pawned\nkettles!...\"\n\nShe flashed three reminiscences.\n\nMeanwhile Lady Harman produced a little glittering object and held it\nbetween finger and thumb. \"If I went into a pawnshop near here,\" she\nsaid, \"it would seem so odd.... This ring, Susan, must be worth thirty\nor forty pounds. And it seems so silly when I have it that I should\nreally be wanting money....\"\n\nSusan displayed a peculiar reluctance to handle the ring. \"I've never,\"\nshe said, \"pawned anything valuable--not valuable like that.\nSuppose--suppose they wanted to know how I had come by it.\"\n\n\"It's more than Alice earns in a year,\" she said. \"It's----\" she eyed\nthe glittering treasure; \"it's a queer thing for me to have.\"\n\nA certain embarrassment arose between them. Lady Harman's need of money\nbecame more apparent. \"I'll do it for you,\" said Susan, \"indeed I'll do\nit. But----There's one thing----\"\n\nHer face flushed hotly. \"It isn't that I want to make difficulties. But\npeople in our position--we aren't like people in your position. It's\nawkward sometimes to explain things. You've got a good character, but\npeople don't know it. You can't be too careful. It isn't\nsufficient--just to be honest. If I take that----If you were just to\ngive me a little note--in your handwriting--on your paper--just asking\nme----I don't suppose I need show it to anyone....\"\n\n\"I'll write the note,\" said Lady Harman. A new set of uncomfortable\nideas was dawning upon her. \"But Susan----You don't mean that anyone,\nanyone who's really honest--might get into trouble?\"\n\n\"You can't be too careful,\" said Susan, manifestly resolved not to give\nour highly civilized state half a chance with her.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a76\n\nThe problem of Sir Isaac and just what he was doing and what he thought\nhe was doing and what he meant to do increased in importance in Lady\nHarman's mind as the days passed by. He had an air of being malignantly\nup to something and she could not imagine what this something could be.\nHe spoke to her very little but he looked at her a great deal. He had\nmore and more of the quality of a premeditated imminent explosion....\n\nOne morning she was standing quite still in the drawing-room thinking\nover this now almost oppressive problem of why the situation did not\ndevelop further with him, when she became aware of a thin flat unusual\nbook upon the small side table near the great armchair at the side of\nthe fire. He had been reading that overnight and it lay obliquely--it\nmight almost have been left out for her.\n\nShe picked it up. It was _The Taming of the Shrew_ in that excellent\nfolio edition of Henley's which makes each play a comfortable thin book\napart. A curiosity to learn what it was had drawn her husband to\nEnglish Literature made her turn over the pages. _The Taming of the\nShrew_ was a play she knew very slightly. For the Harmans, though deeply\nimplicated like most other rich and striving people in plans for\nhonouring the immortal William, like most other people found scanty\nleisure to read him.\n\nAs she turned over the pages a pencil mark caught her eye. Thence words\nwere underlined and further accentuated by a deeply scored line in the\nmargin.\n\n   \"But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.\n   Nay; look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;\n   I will be master of what is mine own:\n   She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,\n   She is my household stuff, my field, my barn,\n   My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing:\n   And here she stands, touch her whoever dare;\n   I'll bring mine action on the proudest He,\n   That stops my way in Padua.\"\n\nWith a slightly heightened colour, Lady Harman read on and presently\nfound another page slashed with Sir Isaac's approval....\n\nHer face became thoughtful. Did he mean to attempt--Petruchio? He could\nnever dare. There were servants, there were the people one met, the\nworld.... He would never dare....\n\nWhat a strange play it was! Shakespear of course was wonderfully wise,\nthe crown of English wisdom, the culminating English mind,--or else one\nmight almost find something a little stupid and clumsy.... Did women\nnowadays really feel like these Elizabethan wives who talked--like\ngirls, very forward girls indeed, but girls of sixteen?...\n\nShe read the culminating speech of Katherine and now she had so\nforgotten Sir Isaac she scarcely noted the pencil line that endorsed the\nimmortal words.\n\n   \"Thy husband is thy Lord, thy Life, thy Keeper,\n   Thy Head, thy Sovereign; one who cares for thee,\n   And for thy maintenance commits his body\n   To painful labour both by sea and land,\n   To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,\n   While thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;\n   And craves no other tribute at thy hands\n   But love, fair looks, and true obedience;\n   Too little payment for so great a debt.\n   Such duty as the Subject owes the Prince,\n   Even such a woman oweth to her husband;\n   And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,\n   And not obedient to his honest will,\n   What is she but a foul contending Rebel\n   And graceless traitor to her loving Lord?\n   I am ashamed that women are so simple\n   To offer war, where they should kneel for peace;\n\n         *       *       *       *       *\n\n   My mind has been as big as one of yours,\n   My heat as great; my reason, haply, more,\n   To bandy word for word and frown for frown.\n   But now I see our lances are but straws;\n   Our strength is weak, our weakness past compare,\n   Seeming that most which we indeed least are....\"\n\nShe wasn't indignant. Something in these lines took hold of her\nprotesting imagination.\n\nShe knew that so she could have spoken of a man.\n\nBut that man,--she apprehended him as vaguely as an Anglican bishop\napprehends God. He was obscured altogether by shadows; he had only one\nknown characteristic, that he was totally unlike Sir Isaac. And the play\nwas false she felt in giving this speech to a broken woman. Such things\nare not said by broken women. Broken women do no more than cheat and\nlie. But so a woman might speak out of her unconquered wilfulness, as a\nqueen might give her lover a kingdom out of the fullness of her heart.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a77\n\nThe evening after his wife had had this glimpse into Sir Isaac's mental\nprocesses he telephoned that Charterson and Horatio Blenker were coming\nhome to dinner with him. Neither Lady Charterson nor Mrs. Blenker were\nto be present; it was to be a business conversation and not a social\noccasion, and Lady Harman he desired should wear her black and gold with\njust a touch of crimson in her hair. Charterson wanted a word or two\nwith the flexible Horatio on sugar at the London docks, and Sir Isaac\nhad some vague ideas that a turn might be given to the public judgment\nupon the waitresses' strike, by a couple of Horatio's thoughtful yet\ngentlemanly articles. And in addition Charterson seemed to have\nsomething else upon his mind; he did not tell as much to Sir Isaac but\nhe was weighing the possibilities of securing a controlling share in\nthe _Daily Spirit_, which simply didn't know at present where it was\nupon the sugar business, and of installing Horatio's brother, Adolphus,\nas its editor. He wanted to form some idea from Horatio of what Adolphus\nmight expect before he approached Adolphus.\n\nLady Harman wore the touch of crimson in her hair as her husband had\ndesired, and the table was decorated simply with a big silver bowl of\ncrimson roses. A slight shade of apprehension in Sir Isaac's face\nchanged to approval at the sight of her obedience. After all perhaps she\nwas beginning to see the commonsense of her position.\n\nCharterson struck her as looking larger, but then whenever she saw him\nhe struck her as looking larger. He enveloped her hand in a large\namiable paw for a minute and asked after the children with gusto. The\nlarge teeth beneath his discursive moustache gave him the effect of a\nperennial smile to which his asymmetrical ears added a touch of waggery.\nHe always betrayed a fatherly feeling towards her as became a man who\nwas married to a handsome wife old enough to be her mother. Even when he\nasked about the children he did it with something of the amused\nknowingness of assured seniority, as if indeed he knew all sorts of\nthings about the children that she couldn't as yet even begin to\nimagine. And though he confined his serious conversation to the two\nother men, he would ever and again show himself mindful of her and throw\nher some friendly enquiry, some quizzically puzzling remark. Blenker as\nusual treated her as if she were an only very indistinctly visible\npresence to whom an effusive yet inattentive politeness was due. He was\nclearly nervous almost to the pitch of jumpiness. He knew he was to be\nspoken to about the sugar business directly he saw Charterson, and he\nhated being spoken to about the sugar business. He had his code of\nhonour. Of course one had to make concessions to one's proprietors, but\nhe could not help feeling that if only they would consent to see his\nreally quite obvious gentlemanliness more clearly it would be better for\nthe paper, better for the party, better for them, far better for\nhimself. He wasn't altogether a fool about that sugar; he knew how\nthings lay. They ought to trust him more. His nervousness betrayed\nitself in many little ways. He crumbled his bread constantly until,\nthanks to Snagsby's assiduous replacement, he had made quite a pile of\ncrumbs, he dropped his glasses in the soup--a fine occasion for\nSnagsby's _sang-froid_--and he forgot not to use a fish knife with the\nfish as Lady Grove directs and tried when he discovered his error to\nreplace it furtively on the table cloth. Moreover he kept on patting the\nglasses on his nose--after Snagsby had whisked his soup plate away,\nrescued, wiped and returned them to him--until that feature glowed\nmodestly at such excesses of attention, and the soup and sauces and\nthings bothered his fine blond moustache unusually. So that Mr. Blenker\nwhat with the glasses, the napkin, the food and the things seemed as\nrestless as a young sparrow. Lady Harman did her duties as hostess in\nthe quiet key of her sombre dress, and until the conversation drew her\nout into unexpected questionings she answered rather than talked, and\nshe did not look at her husband once throughout the meal.\n\nAt first the talk was very largely Charterson. He had no intention of\ncoming to business with Blenker until Lady Harman had given place to the\nport and the man's nerves were steadier. He spoke of this and that in\nthe large discursive way men use in clubs, and it was past the fish\nbefore the conversation settled down upon the topic of business\norganization and Sir Isaac, a little warmed by champagne, came out of\nthe uneasily apprehensive taciturnity into which he had fallen in the\npresence of his wife. Horatio Blenker was keenly interested in the\nidealization of commercial syndication, he had been greatly stirred by a\nbook of Mr. Gerald Stanley Lee's called _Inspired Millionaires_ which\nset out to show just what magnificent airs rich men might give\nthemselves, and he had done his best to catch its tone and to find\n_Inspired Millionaires_ in Sir Isaac and Charterson and to bring it to\ntheir notice and to the notice of the readers of the _Old Country\nGazette_. He felt that if only Sir Isaac and Charterson would see\ngetting rich as a Great Creative Act it would raise their tone and his\ntone and the tone of the _Old Country Gazette_ tremendously. It wouldn't\nof course materially alter the methods or policy of the paper but it\nwould make them all feel nobler, and Blenker was of that finer clay that\ndoes honestly want to feel nobler. He hated pessimism and all that\ncriticism and self-examination that makes weak men pessimistic, he\nwanted to help weak men and be helped himself, he was all for that\nschool of optimism that would have each dunghill was a well-upholstered\nthrone, and his nervous, starry contributions to the talk were like\npatches of water ranunculuses trying to flower in the overflow of a\nsewer.\n\nBecause you know it is idle to pretend that the talk of Charterson and\nSir Isaac wasn't a heavy flow of base ideas; they hadn't even the wit to\nsham very much about their social significance. They cared no more for\nthe growth, the stamina, the spirit of the people whose lives they\ndominated than a rat cares for the stability of the house it gnaws. They\n_wanted_ a broken-spirited people. They were in such relations wilfully\nand offensively stupid, and I do not see why we people who read and\nwrite books should pay this stupidity merely because it is prevalent\neven the mild tribute of an ironical civility. Charterson talked of the\ngathering trouble that might lead to a strike of the transport workers\nin London docks, and what he had to say, he said,--he repeated it\nseveral times--was, \"_Let_ them strike. We're ready. The sooner they\nstrike the better. Devonport's a Man and this time we'll _beat_ 'em....\"\n\nHe expanded generally on strikes. \"It's a question practically whether\nwe are to manage our own businesses or whether we're to have them\nmanaged for us. _Managed_ I say!...\"\n\n\"They know nothing of course of the details of organization,\" said\nBlenker, shining with intelligence and looking quickly first to the\nright and then to the left. \"Nothing.\"\n\nSir Isaac broke out into confirmatory matter. There was an idea in his\nhead that this talk might open his wife's eyes to some sense of the\nmagnitude of his commercial life, to the wonder of its scale and\nquality. He compared notes with Charterson upon a speeding-up system for\ndelivery vans invented by an American specialist and it made Blenker\nflush with admiration and turn as if for sympathy to Lady Harman to\nrealize how a modification in a tailboard might mean a yearly saving in\nwages of many thousand pounds. \"The sort of thing they don't\nunderstand,\" he said. And then Sir Isaac told of some of his own little\ndevices. He had recently taken to having the returns of percentage\nincrease and decrease from his various districts printed on postcards\nand circulated monthly among the district managers, postcards endorsed\nwith such stimulating comments in red type as \"Well done Cardiff!\" or\n\"What ails Portsmouth?\"--the results had been amazingly good; \"neck and\nneck work,\" he said, \"everywhere\"--and thence they passed to the\nquestion of confidential reports and surprise inspectors. Thereby they\ncame to the rights and wrongs of the waitress strike.\n\nAnd then it was that Lady Harman began to take a share in the\nconversation.\n\nShe interjected a question. \"Yes,\" she said suddenly and her\ninterruption was so unexpected that all three men turned their eyes to\nher. \"But how much do the girls get a week?\"\n\n\"I thought,\" she said to some confused explanations by Blenker and\nCharterson, \"that gratuities were forbidden.\"\n\nBlenker further explained that most of the girls of the class Sir Isaac\nwas careful to employ lived at home. Their income was \"supplementary.\"\n\n\"But what happens to the others who don't live at home, Mr. Blenker?\"\nshe asked.\n\n\"Very small minority,\" said Mr. Blenker reassuring himself about his\nglasses.\n\n\"But what do they do?\"\n\nCharterson couldn't imagine whether she was going on in this way out of\nsheer ignorance or not.\n\n\"Sometimes their fines make big unexpected holes in their week's pay,\"\nshe said.\n\nSir Isaac made some indistinct remark about \"utter nonsense.\"\n\n\"It seems to me to be driving them straight upon the streets.\"\n\nThe phrase was Susan's. Its full significance wasn't at that time very\nclear to Lady Harman and it was only when she had uttered it that she\nrealized from Horatio Blenker's convulsive start just what a blow she\nhad delivered at that table. His glasses came off again. He caught them\nand thrust them back, he seemed to be holding his nose on, holding his\nface on, preserving those carefully arranged features of himself from\nhideous revelations; his free hand made weak movements with his dinner\nnapkin. He seemed to be holding it in reserve against the ultimate\nfailure of his face. Charterson surveyed her through an immense pause\nopen-mouthed; then he turned his large now frozen amiability upon his\nhost. \"These are Awful questions,\" he gasped, \"rather beyond Us don't\nyou think?\" and then magnificently; \"Harman, things are looking pretty\nQueer in the Far East again. I'm told there are chances--of\nrevolution--even in Pekin....\"\n\nLady Harman became aware of Snagsby's arm and his steady well-trained\nbreathing beside her as, tenderly almost but with a regretful\ndisapproval, he removed her plate....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a78\n\nIf Lady Harman had failed to remark at the time the deep impression her\nwords had made upon her hearers, she would have learnt it later from the\nextraordinary wrath in which Sir Isaac, as soon as his guests had\ndeparted, visited her. He was so angry he broke the seal of silence he\nhad set upon his lips. He came raging into the pink bedroom through the\npaper-covered door as if they were back upon their old intimate footing.\nHe brought a flavour of cigars and manly refreshment with him, his\nshirt front was a little splashed and crumpled and his white face was\nvariegated with flushed patches.\n\n\"What ever d'you mean,\" he cried, \"by making a fool of me in front of\nthose fellers?... What's my business got to do with you?\"\n\nLady Harman was too unready for a reply.\n\n\"I ask you what's my business got to do with you? It's _my_ affair, _my_\nside. You got no more right to go shoving your spoke into that\nthan--anything. See? What do _you_ know of the rights and wrongs of\nbusiness? How can _you_ tell what's right and what isn't right? And the\nthings you came out with--the things you came out with! Why\nCharterson--after you'd gone Charterson said, she doesn't know, she\ncan't know what she's talking about! A decent woman! a _lady_! talking\nof driving girls on the street. You ought to be ashamed of yourself! You\naren't fit to show your face.... It's these damned papers and pamphlets,\nall this blear-eyed stuff, these decadent novels and things putting\nnarsty thoughts, _narsty dirty_ thoughts into decent women's heads. It\nought to be rammed back down their throats, it ought to be put a stop\nto!\"\n\nSir Isaac suddenly gave way to woe. \"What have I _done_?\" he cried,\n\"what have I done? Here's everything going so well! We might be the\nhappiest of couples! We're rich, we got everything we want.... And then\nyou go harbouring these ideas, fooling about with rotten people, taking\nup with Socialism----Yes, I tell you--Socialism!\"\n\nHis moment of pathos ended. \"NO?\" he shouted in an enormous voice.\n\nHe became white and grim. He emphasized his next words with a shaken\nfinger.\n\n\"It's got to end, my lady. It's going to end sooner than you expect.\nThat's all!...\"\n\nHe paused at the papered door. He had a popular craving for a vivid\ncurtain and this he felt was just a little too mild.\n\n\"It's going to end,\" he repeated and then with great violence, with\nalmost alcoholic violence, with the round eyes and shouting voice and\nshaken fist and blaspheming violence of a sordid, thrifty peasant\nenraged, \"it's going to end a Damned Sight sooner than you expect.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE EIGHTH\n\nSIR ISAAC AS PETRUCHIO\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a71\n\nTwice had Sir Isaac come near to betraying the rapid and extensive\npreparations for the subjugation of his wife, that he hid behind his\nsilences. He hoped that their estrangement might be healed by a certain\ndisplay of strength and decision. He still refused to let himself\nbelieve that all this trouble that had arisen between them, this sullen\ninsistence upon unbecoming freedoms of intercourse and movement, this\nquestioning spirit and a gaucherie of manner that might almost be\nmistaken for an aversion from his person, were due to any essential evil\nin her nature; he clung almost passionately to the alternative that she\nwas the victim of those gathering forces of discontent, of that\ninterpretation which can only be described as decadent and that veracity\nwhich can only be called immodest, that darken the intellectual skies of\nour time, a sweet thing he held her still though touched by corruption,\na prey to \"idees,\" \"idees\" imparted from the poisoned mind of her\nsister, imbibed from the carelessly edited columns of newspapers, from\nall too laxly censored plays, from \"blear-eyed\" bookshow he thanked the\nArchbishop of York for that clever expressive epithet!--from the\ncareless talk of rashly admitted guests, from the very atmosphere of\nLondon. And it had grown clearer and clearer to him that his duty to\nhimself and the world and her was to remove her to a purer, simpler air,\nbeyond the range of these infections, to isolate her and tranquillize\nher and so win her back again to that acquiescence, that entirely\nhopeless submissiveness that had made her so sweet and dear a companion\nfor him in the earlier years of their married life. Long before Lady\nBeach-Mandarin's crucial luncheon, his deliberate foreseeing mind had\nbeen planning such a retreat. Black Strand even at his first visit had\nappeared to him in the light of a great opportunity, and the crisis of\ntheir quarrel did but release that same torrential energy which had\ncarried him to a position of Napoleonic predominance in the world of\nbaking, light catering and confectionery, into the channels of a scheme\nalready very definitely formed in his mind.\n\nHis first proceeding after the long hours of sleepless passion that had\nfollowed his wife's Hampton Court escapade, had been to place himself in\ncommunication with Mr. Brumley. He learnt at Mr. Brumley's club that\nthat gentleman had slept there overnight and had started but a quarter\nof an hour before, back to Black Strand. Sir Isaac in hot pursuit and\ngathering force and assistance in mid flight reached Black Strand by\nmidday.\n\nIt was with a certain twinge of the conscience that Mr. Brumley\nperceived his visitor, but it speedily became clear that Sir Isaac had\nno knowledge of the guilty circumstances of the day before. He had come\nto buy Black Strand--incontinently, that was all. He was going, it\nbecame clear at once, to buy it with all its fittings and furnishings as\nit stood, lock, stock and barrel. Mr. Brumley, concealing that wild\nelation, that sense of a joyous rebirth, that only the liquidation of\nnearly all one's possessions can give, was firm but not excessive. Sir\nIsaac haggled as a wave breaks and then gave in and presently they were\nmaking a memorandum upon the pretty writing-desk beneath the traditional\nrose Euphemia had established there when Mr. Brumley was young and\nalready successful.\n\nThis done, and it was done in less than fifteen minutes, Sir Isaac\nproduced a rather crumpled young architect from the motor-car as a\nconjurer might produce a rabbit from a hat, a builder from Aleham\nappeared astonishingly in a dog-cart--he had been summoned by\ntelegram--and Sir Isaac began there and then to discuss alterations,\nenlargements and, more particularly, with a view to his nursery\nrequirements, the conversion of the empty barn into a nursery wing and\nits connexion with the house by a corridor across the shrubbery.\n\n\"It will take you three months,\" said the builder from Aleham. \"And the\nworst time of the year coming.\"\n\n\"It won't take three weeks--if I have to bring down a young army from\nLondon to do it,\" said Sir Isaac.\n\n\"But such a thing as plastering----\"\n\n\"We won't have plastering.\"\n\n\"There's canvas and paper, of course,\" said the young architect.\n\n\"There's canvas and paper,\" said Sir Isaac. \"And those new patent\nbuilding units, so far as the corridor goes. I've seen the ads.\"\n\n\"We can whitewash 'em. They won't show much,\" said the young architect.\n\n\"Oh if you do things in _that_ way,\" said the builder from Aleham with\nbitter resignation....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a72\n\nThe morning dawned at last when the surprise was ripe. It was four days\nafter Susan's visit, and she was due again on the morrow with the money\nthat would enable her employer to go to Lady Viping's now imminent\ndinner. Lady Harman had had to cut the Social Friends' meeting\naltogether, but the day before the surprise Agatha Alimony had come to\ntea in her jobbed car, and they had gone together to the committee\nmeeting of the Shakespear Dinner Society. Sir Isaac had ignored that\ndefiance, and it was an unusually confident and quite unsuspicious woman\nwho descended in a warm October sunshine to the surprise. In the\nbreakfast-room she discovered an awe-stricken Snagsby standing with his\nplate-basket before her husband, and her husband wearing strange unusual\ntweeds and gaiters,--buttoned gaiters, and standing a-straddle,--unusually\na-straddle, on the hearthrug.\n\n\"That's enough, Snagsby,\" said Sir Isaac, at her entrance. \"Bring it\nall.\"\n\nShe met Snagsby's eye, and it was portentous.\n\nLatterly Snagsby's eye had lost the assurance of his former days. She\nhad noted it before, she noted it now more than ever; as though he was\nlosing confidence, as though he was beginning to doubt, as though the\nworld he had once seemed to rule grew insecure beneath his feet. For a\nmoment she met his eye; it might have been a warning he conveyed, it\nmight have been an appeal for sympathy, and then he had gone. She looked\nat the table. Sir Isaac had breakfasted acutely.\n\nIn silence, among the wreckage and with a certain wonder growing, Lady\nHarman attended to her needs.\n\nSir Isaac cleared his throat.\n\nShe became aware that he had spoken. \"What did you say, Isaac?\" she\nasked, looking up. He seemed to have widened his straddle almost\ndangerously, and he spoke with a certain conscious forcefulness.\n\n\"We're going to move out of this house, Elly,\" he said. \"We're going\ndown into the country right away.\"\n\nShe sat back in her chair and regarded his pinched and determined\nvisage.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked.\n\n\"I've bought that house of Brumley's,--Black Strand. We're going to move\ndown there--_now_. I've told the servants.... When you've done your\nbreakfast, you'd better get Peters to pack your things. The big car's\ngoing to be ready at half-past ten.\"\n\nLady Harman reflected.\n\n\"To-morrow evening,\" she said, \"I was going out to dinner at Lady\nViping's.\"\n\n\"Not my affair--seemingly,\" said Sir Isaac with irony. \"Well, the car's\ngoing to be ready at half-past ten.\"\n\n\"But that dinner----!\"\n\n\"We'll think about it when the time comes.\"\n\nHusband and wife regarded each other.\n\n\"I've had about enough of London,\" said Sir Isaac. \"So we're going to\nshift the scenery. See?\"\n\nLady Harman felt that one might adduce good arguments against this\ncourse if only one knew of them.\n\nSir Isaac had a bright idea. He rang.\n\n\"Snagsby,\" he said, \"just tell Peters to pack up Lady Harman's\nthings....\"\n\n\"_Well!_\" said Lady Harman, as the door closed on Snagsby. Her mind was\nfull of confused protest, but she had again that entirely feminine and\ndemoralizing conviction that if she tried to express it she would weep\nor stumble into some such emotional disaster. If now she went upstairs\nand told Peters _not_ to pack----!\n\nSir Isaac walked slowly to the window, and stood for a time staring out\ninto the garden.\n\nExtraordinary bumpings began overhead in Sir Isaac's room. No doubt\nsomebody was packing something....\n\nLady Harman realized with a deepening humiliation that she dared not\ndispute before the servants, and that he could. \"But the children----\"\nshe said at last.\n\n\"I've told Mrs. Harblow,\" he said, over his shoulder. \"Told her it was a\nbit of a surprise.\" He turned, with a momentary lapse into something\nlike humour. \"You see,\" he said, \"it _is_ a bit of a surprise.\"\n\n\"But what are you going to do with this house?\"\n\n\"Lock it all up for a bit.... I don't see any sense in living where we\naren't happy. Perhaps down there we shall manage better....\"\n\nIt emerged from the confusion of Lady Harman's mind that perhaps she had\nbetter go to the nursery, and see how things were getting on there. Sir\nIsaac watched her departure with a slightly dubious eye, made little\nnoises with his teeth for a time, and then went towards the telephone.\n\nIn the hall she found two strange young men in green aprons assisting\nthe under-butler to remove the hats and overcoats and such-like personal\nmaterial into a motor-van outside. She heard two of the housemaids\nscurrying upstairs. \"'Arf an hour,\" said one, \"isn't what I call a\nproper time to pack a box in.\"\n\nIn the nursery the children were disputing furiously what toys were to\nbe taken into the country.\n\nLady Harman was a very greatly astonished woman. The surprise had been\nentirely successful.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a73\n\nIt has been said, I think, by Limburger, in his already cited work, that\nnothing so excites and prevails with woman as rapid and extensive\nviolence, sparing and yet centring upon herself, and certainly it has to\nbe recorded that, so far from being merely indignant, and otherwise a\nhelplessly pathetic spectacle, Lady Harman found, though perhaps she did\nnot go quite so far as to admit to herself that she found, this vehement\nflight from the social, moral, and intellectual contaminations of London\nan experience not merely stimulating but entertaining. It lifted her\ndelicate eyebrows. Something, it may have been a sense of her own\ncomparative immobility amid this sudden extraordinary bustle of her\nhome, put it into her head that so it was long ago that Lot must have\nbundled together his removable domesticities.\n\nShe made one attempt at protest. \"Isaac,\" she said, \"isn't all this\nrather ridiculous----\"\n\n\"Don't speak to me!\" he answered, waving her off. \"Don't speak to me!\nYou should have spoken before, Elly. _Now_,--things are happening.\"\n\nThe image of Black Strand as, after all, a very pleasant place indeed\nreturned to her. She adjudicated upon the nursery difficulties, and then\nwent in a dreamlike state of mind to preside over her own more personal\npacking. She found Peters exercising all that indecisive helplessness\nwhich is characteristic of ladies' maids the whole world over.\n\nIt was from Peters she learnt that the entire household, men and maids\ntogether, was to be hurled into Surrey. \"Aren't they all rather\nsurprised?\" asked Lady Harman.\n\n\"Yes, m'm,\" said Peters on her knees, \"but of course if the drains is\nwrong the sooner we all go the better.\"\n\n(So that was what he had told them.)\n\nA vibration and a noise of purring machinery outside drew the lady to\nthe window, and she discovered that at least four of the large\nmotor-vans from the International Stores were to co-operate in the trek.\nThere they were waiting, massive and uniform. And then she saw Snagsby\nin his alpaca jacket _running_ towards the house from the gates. Of\ncourse he was running only very slightly indeed, but still he was\nrunning, and the expression of distress upon his face convinced her that\nhe was being urged to unusual and indeed unsuitable tasks under the\nimmediate personal supervision of Sir Isaac.... Then from round the\ncorner appeared the under butler or at least the legs of him going very\nfast, under a pile of shirt boxes and things belonging to Sir Isaac. He\ndumped them into the nearest van and heaved a deep sigh and returned\nhouseward after a remorseful glance at the windows.\n\nA violent outcry from baby, who, with more than her customary violence\nwas making her customary morning protest against being clad, recalled\nLady Harman from the contemplation of these exterior activities....\n\nThe journey to Black Strand was not accomplished without misadventure;\nthere was a puncture near Farnham, and as Clarence with a leisurely\nassurance entertained himself with the Stepney, they were passed first\nby the second car with the nursery contingent, which went by in a shrill\nchorus, crying, \"_We-e-e_ shall get there first, _We-e-e_ shall get\nthere first,\" and then by a large hired car all agog with housemaids and\nMrs. Crumble and with Snagsby, as round and distressed as the full moon,\nand the under butler, cramped and keen beside the driver. There followed\nthe leading International Stores car, and then the Stepney was on and\nthey could hasten in pursuit....\n\nAnd at last they came to Black Strand, and when they saw Black Strand it\nseemed to Lady Harman that the place had blown out a huge inflamed red\ncheek and lost its pleasant balance altogether. \"_Oh!_\" she cried.\n\nIt was the old barn flushed by the strain of adaptation to a new use,\nits comfortable old wall ruptured by half a dozen brilliant new windows,\na light red chimney stack at one end. From it a vividly artistic\ncorridor ran to the house and the rest of the shrubbery was all trampled\nand littered with sheds, bricks, poles and material generally. Black\nStrand had left the hands of the dilettante school and was in the grip\nof those vigorous moulding forces that are shaping our civilization\nto-day.\n\nThe jasmine wig over the porch had suffered a strenuous clipping; the\ndoor might have just come out of prison. In the hall the Carpaccio\ncopies still glowed, but there were dust sheets over most of the\nfurniture and a plumber was moving his things out with that eleventh\nhour reluctance so characteristic of plumbers. Mrs. Rabbit, a little\ntearful, and dressed for departure very respectably in black was giving\nthe youngest and least experienced housemaid a faithful history of Mr.\nBrumley's earlier period. \"'Appy we all was,\" said Mrs. Rabbit, \"as\nBirds in a Nest.\"\n\nThrough the windows two of the Putney gardeners were busy replacing Mr.\nBrumley's doubtful roses by recognized sorts, the _right_ sorts....\n\n\"I've been doing all I can to make it ready for you,\" said Sir Isaac at\nhis wife's ear, bringing a curious reminiscence of the first home-coming\nto Putney into her mind.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a74\n\n\"And now,\" said Sir Isaac with evident premeditation and a certain\ndeliberate amiability, \"now we got down here, now we got away a bit from\nall those London things with nobody to cut in between us, me and you can\nhave a bit of a talk, Elly, and see what it's all about.\"\n\nThey had lunched together in the little hall-dining room,--the children\nhad had a noisily cheerful picnic in the kitchen with Mrs. Harblow, and\nnow Lady Harman was standing at the window surveying the ravages of rose\nreplacement.\n\nShe turned towards him. \"Yes,\" she said. \"I think--I think we can't go\non like this.\"\n\n\"_I_ can't,\" said Sir Isaac, \"anyhow.\"\n\nHe too came and stared at the rose planting.\n\n\"If we were to go up there--among the pine woods\"--he pointed with his\nhead at the dark background of Euphemia's herbaceous borders--\"we\nshouldn't hear quite so much of this hammering....\"\n\nHusband and wife walked slowly in the afternoon sunlight across the\nstill beautiful garden. Each was gravely aware of an embarrassed\nincapacity for the task they had set themselves. They were going to talk\nthings over. Never in their lives had they really talked to each other\nclearly and honestly about anything. Indeed it is scarcely too much to\nsay that neither had ever talked about anything to anyone. She was too\nyoung, her mind was now growing up in her and feeling its way to\nconscious expression, and he had never before wanted to express himself.\nHe did now want to express himself. For behind his rant and fury Sir\nIsaac had been thinking very hard indeed during the last three weeks\nabout his life and her life and their relations; he had never thought so\nmuch about anything except his business economics. So far he had either\njoked at her, talked \"silly\" to her, made, as they say, \"remarks,\" or\nvociferated. That had been the sum of their mental intercourse, as\nindeed it is the sum of the intercourse of most married couples. His\nattempt to state his case to her had so far always flared into\nrhetorical outbreaks. But he was discontented with these rhetorical\noutbreaks. His dispositions to fall into them made him rather like a\nnervous sepia that cannot keep its ink sac quiet while it is sitting for\nits portrait. In the earnestness of his attempt at self-display he\nvanished in his own outpourings.\n\nHe wanted now to reason with her simply and persuasively. He wanted to\nsay quietly impressive and convincing things in a low tone of voice and\nmake her abandon every possible view except his view. He walked now\nslowly meditating the task before him, making a faint thoughtful noise\nwith his teeth, his head sunken in the collar of the motor overcoat he\nwore because of a slight cold he had caught. And he had to be careful\nabout colds because of his constitutional defect. She too felt she had\nmuch to say. Much too she had in her mind that she couldn't say, because\nthis strange quarrel had opened unanticipated things for her; she had\nfound and considered repugnances in her nature she had never dared to\nglance at hitherto....\n\nSir Isaac began rather haltingly when they had reached a sandy,\nant-infested path that ran slantingly up among the trees. He affected a\ncertain perplexity. He said he did not understand what it was his wife\nwas \"after,\" what she \"thought she was doing\" in \"making all this\ntrouble\"; he wanted to know just what it was she wanted, how she thought\nthey ought to live, just what she considered his rights were as her\nhusband and just what she considered were her duties as his wife--if,\nthat is, she considered she had any duties. To these enquiries Lady\nHarman made no very definite reply; their estrangement instead of\nclearing her mind had on the whole perplexed it more, by making her\nrealize the height and depth and extent of her possible separation from\nhim. She replied therefore with an unsatisfactory vagueness; she said\nshe wanted to feel that she possessed herself, that she was no longer a\nchild, that she thought she had a right to read what she chose, see what\npeople she liked, go out a little by herself, have a certain\nindependence--she hesitated, \"have a certain definite allowance of my\nown.\"\n\n\"Have I ever refused you money?\" cried Sir Isaac protesting.\n\n\"It isn't that,\" said Lady Harman; \"it's the feeling----\"\n\n\"The feeling of being able to--defy--anything I say,\" said Sir Isaac\nwith a note of bitterness. \"As if I didn't understand!\"\n\nIt was beyond Lady Harman's powers to express just how that wasn't the\nprecise statement of the case.\n\nSir Isaac, reverting to his tone of almost elaborate reasonableness,\nexpanded his view that it was impossible for husband and wife to have\ntwo different sets of friends;--let alone every other consideration, he\nexplained, it wasn't convenient for them not to be about together, and\nas for reading or thinking what she chose he had never made any\nobjection to anything unless it was \"decadent rot\" that any decent man\nwould object to his womanfolk seeing, rot she couldn't understand the\ndrift of--fortunately. Blear-eyed humbug.... He checked himself on the\nverge of an almost archiepiscopal outbreak in order to be patiently\nreasonable again. He was prepared to concede that it would be very nice\nif Lady Harman could be a good wife and also an entirely independent\nperson, very nice, but the point was--his tone verged on the\nironical--that she couldn't be two entirely different people at the same\ntime.\n\n\"But you have your friends,\" she said, \"you go away alone----\"\n\n\"That's different,\" said Sir Isaac with a momentary note of annoyance.\n\"It's business. It isn't that I want to.\"\n\nLady Harman had a feeling that they were neither of them gaining any\nground. She blamed herself for her lack of lucidity. She began again,\ntaking up the matter at a fresh point. She said that her life at present\nwasn't full, that it was only half a life, that it was just home and\nmarriage and nothing else; he had his business, he went out into the\nworld, he had politics and--\"all sorts of things\"; she hadn't these\ninterests; she had nothing in the place of them----\n\nSir Isaac closed this opening rather abruptly by telling her that she\nshould count herself lucky she hadn't, and again the conversation was\nsuspended for a time.\n\n\"But I want to know about these things,\" she said.\n\nSir Isaac took that musingly.\n\n\"There's things go on,\" she said; \"outside home. There's social work,\nthere's interests----Am I never to take any part--in that?\"\n\nSir Isaac still reflected.\n\n\"There's one thing,\" he said at last, \"I want to know. We'd better have\nit out--_now_.\"\n\nBut he hesitated for a time.\n\n\"Elly!\" he blundered, \"you aren't--you aren't getting somehow--not fond\nof me?\"\n\nShe made no immediate reply.\n\n\"Look here!\" he said in an altered voice. \"Elly! there isn't something\nbelow all this? There isn't something been going on that I don't know?\"\n\nHer eyes with a certain terror in their depths questioned him.\n\n\"Something,\" he said, and his face was deadly white--\"_Some other man,\nElly?_\"\n\nShe was suddenly crimson, a flaming indignation.\n\n\"Isaac!\" she said, \"what do you _mean_? How can you _ask_ me such a\nthing?\"\n\n\"If it's that!\" said Sir Isaac, his face suddenly full of malignant\nforce, \"I'll----But I'd _kill_ you....\"\n\n\"If it isn't that,\" he went on searching his mind; \"why should a woman\nget restless? Why should she want to go away from her husband, go\nmeeting other people, go gadding about? If a woman's satisfied, she's\nsatisfied. She doesn't harbour fancies.... All this grumbling and\nunrest. Natural for your sister, but why should you? You've got\neverything a woman needs, husband, children, a perfectly splendid home,\nclothes, good jewels and plenty of them, respect! Why should you want to\ngo out after things? It's mere spoilt-childishness. Of course you want\nto wander out--and if there isn't a man----\"\n\nHe caught her wrist suddenly. \"There isn't a man?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Isaac!\" she protested in horror.\n\n\"Then there'll be one. You think I'm a fool, you think I don't know\nanything all these literary and society people know. I _do_ know. I know\nthat a man and a woman have got to stick together, and if you go\nstraying--you may think you're straying after the moon or social work or\nanything--but there's a strange man waiting round the corner for every\nwoman and a strange woman for every man. Think _I_'ve had no\ntemptations?... Oh! I _know_, I _know_. What's life or anything but\nthat? and it's just because we've not gone on having more children, just\nbecause we listened to all those fools who said you were overdoing it,\nthat all this fretting and grumbling began. We've got on to the wrong\ntrack, Elly, and we've got to get back to plain wholesome ways of\nliving. See? That's what I've come down here for and what I mean to do.\nWe've got to save ourselves. I've been too--too modern and all that. I'm\ngoing to be a husband as a husband should. I'm going to protect you from\nthese idees--protect you from your own self.... And that's about where\nwe stand, Elly, as I make it out.\"\n\nHe paused with the effect of having delivered himself of long\npremeditated things.\n\nLady Harman essayed to speak. But she found that directly she set\nherself to speak she sobbed and began weeping. She choked for a moment.\nThen she determined she would go on, and if she must cry, she must cry.\nShe couldn't let a disposition to tears seal her in silence for ever.\n\n\"It isn't,\" she said, \"what I expected--of life. It isn't----\"\n\n\"It's what life is,\" Sir Isaac cut in.\n\n\"When I think,\" she sobbed, \"of what I've lost----\"\n\n\"_Lost!_\" cried Sir Isaac. \"Lost! Oh come now, Elly, I like that.\nWhat!--_lost_. Hang it! You got to look facts in the face. You can't\ndeny----Marrying like this,--you made a jolly good thing of it.\"\n\n\"But the beautiful things, the noble things!\"\n\n\"_What's_ beautiful?\" cried Sir Isaac in protesting scorn. \"_What's_\nnoble? ROT! Doing your duty if you like and being sensible, that's noble\nand beautiful, but not fretting about and running yourself into danger.\nYou've got to have a sense of humour, Elly, in this life----\" He created\na quotation. \"As you make your bed--so shall you lie.\"\n\nFor an interval neither of them spoke. They crested the hill, and came\ninto view of that advertisement board she had first seen in Mr.\nBrumley's company. She halted, and he went a step further and halted\ntoo. He recalled his ideas about the board. He had meant to have them\nall altered but other things had driven it from his mind....\n\n\"Then you mean to imprison me here,\" said Lady Harman to his back. He\nturned about.\n\n\"It isn't much like a prison. I'm asking you to stay here--and be what a\nwife _should_ be.\"\n\n\"I'm to have no money.\"\n\n\"That's--that depends entirely on yourself. You know that well enough.\"\n\nShe looked at him gravely.\n\n\"I won't stand it,\" she said at last with a gentle deliberation.\n\nShe spoke so softly that he doubted his hearing. \"_What?_\" he asked\nsharply.\n\n\"I won't stand it,\" she repeated. \"No.\"\n\n\"But--what can you do?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said, after a moment of grave consideration.\n\nFor some moments his mind hunted among possibilities.\n\n\"It's me that's standing it,\" he said. He came closely up to her. He\nseemed on the verge of rhetoric. He pressed his thin white lips\ntogether. \"Standing it! when we might be so happy,\" he snapped, and\nshrugged his shoulders and turned with an expression of mournful\nresolution towards the house again. She followed slowly.\n\nHe felt that he had done all that a patient and reasonable husband could\ndo. _Now_--things must take their course.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a75\n\nThe imprisonment of Lady Harman at Black Strand lasted just one day\nshort of a fortnight.\n\nFor all that time except for such interludes as the urgent needs of the\nstrike demanded, Sir Isaac devoted himself to the siege. He did all he\ncould to make her realize how restrainedly he used the powers the law\nvests in a husband, how little he forced upon her the facts of marital\nauthority and wifely duty. At times he sulked, at times he affected a\ncold dignity, and at times a virile anger swayed him at her unsubmissive\nsilences. He gave her little peace in that struggle, a struggle that\ncame to the edge of physical conflict. There were moments when it seemed\nto her that nothing remained but that good old-fashioned connubial\ninstitution, the tussle for the upper hand, when with a feminine horror\nshe felt violence shouldering her shoulder or contracting ready to grip\nher wrist. Against violence she doubted her strength, was filled with a\ndesolating sense of yielding nerve and domitable muscle. But just short\nof violence Sir Isaac's spirit failed him. He would glower and bluster,\nhalf threaten, and retreat. It might come to that at last but at present\nit had not come to that.\n\nShe could not understand why she had neither message nor sign from Susan\nBurnet, but she hid that anxiety and disappointment under her general\ndignity.\n\nShe spent as much time with the children as she could, and until Sir\nIsaac locked up the piano she played, and was surprised to find far more\nin Chopin than she had ever suspected in the days when she had acquired\na passable dexterity of execution. She found, indeed, the most curious\nthings in Chopin, emotional phrases, that stirred and perplexed and yet\npleased her....\n\nThe weather was very fine and open that year. A golden sunshine from\nOctober passed on into November and Lady Harman spent many of these days\namidst the pretty things the builder from Aleham had been too hurried to\ndesecrate, dump, burn upon, and flatten into indistinguishable mire,\nafter the established custom of builders in gardens since the world\nbegan. She would sit in the rockery where she had sat with Mr. Brumley\nand recall that momentous conversation, and she would wander up the\npine-wood slopes behind, and she would spend long musing intervals among\nEuphemia's perennials, thinking sometimes, and sometimes not so much\nthinking as feeling the warm tendernesses of nature and the perplexing\ndifficulties of human life. With an amused amazement Lady Harman\nreflected as she walked about the pretty borders and the little patches\nof lawn and orchard that in this very place she was to have realized an\nimitation of the immortal \"Elizabeth\" and have been wise, witty, gay,\ndefiant, gallant and entirely successful with her \"Man of Wrath.\"\nEvidently there was some temperamental difference, or something in her\nsituation, that altered the values of the affair. It was clearly a\ndifferent sort of man for one thing. She didn't feel a bit gay, and her\nprofound and deepening indignation with the alternative to this\nstagnation was tainted by a sense of weakness and incapacity.\n\nShe came very near surrender several times. There were afternoons of\nbelated ripened warmth, a kind of summer that had been long in the\nbottle, with a certain lassitude in the air and a blue haze among the\ntrees, that made her feel the folly of all resistances to fate. Why,\nafter all, shouldn't she take life as she found it, that is to say, as\nSir Isaac was prepared to give it to her? He wasn't really so bad, she\ntold herself. The children--their noses were certainly a little sharp,\nbut there might be worse children. The next might take after herself\nmore. Who was she to turn upon her appointed life and declare it wasn't\ngood enough? Whatever happened the world was still full of generous and\nbeautiful things, trees, flowers, sunset and sunrise, music and mist and\nmorning dew.... And as for this matter of the sweated workers, the\nharshness of the business, the ungracious competition, suppose if\ninstead of fighting her husband with her weak powers, she persuaded him.\nShe tried to imagine just exactly how he might be persuaded....\n\nShe looked up and discovered with an extraordinary amazement Mr. Brumley\nwith eager gestures and a flushed and excited visage hurrying towards\nher across the croquet lawn.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a76\n\nLady Viping's dinner-party had been kept waiting exactly thirty-five\nminutes for Lady Harman. Sir Isaac, with a certain excess of zeal, had\nintercepted the hasty note his wife had written to account for her\nprobable absence. The party was to have centred entirely upon Lady\nHarman, it consisted either of people who knew her already, or of people\nwho were to have been specially privileged to know her, and Lady Viping\ntelephoned twice to Putney before she abandoned hope. \"It's\ndisconnected,\" she said, returning in despair from her second struggle\nwith the great public service. \"They can't get a reply.\"\n\n\"It's that little wretch,\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin. \"He hasn't let her\ncome. _I_ know him.\"\n\n\"It's like losing a front tooth,\" said Lady Viping, surveying her table\nas she entered the dining-room.\n\n\"But surely--she would have written,\" said Mr. Brumley, troubled and\ndisappointed, regarding an aching gap to the left of his chair, a gap\nupon which a pathetic little card bearing Lady Harman's name still lay\nobliquely.\n\nNaturally the talk tended to centre upon the Harmans. And naturally Lady\nBeach-Mandarin was very bold and outspoken and called Sir Isaac quite a\nnumber of vivid things. She also aired her views of the marriage of the\nfuture, which involved a very stringent treatment of husbands indeed.\n\"Half his property and half his income,\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin,\n\"paid into her separate banking account.\"\n\n\"But,\" protested Mr. Brumley, \"would men marry under those conditions?\"\n\n\"Men will marry anyhow,\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin, \"under _any_\nconditions.\"\n\n\"Exactly Sir Joshua's opinion,\" said Lady Viping.\n\nAll the ladies at the table concurred and only one cheerful bachelor\nbarrister dissented. The other men became gloomy and betrayed a distaste\nfor this general question. Even Mr. Brumley felt a curious faint terror\nand had for a moment a glimpse of the possibilities that might lie\nbehind the Vote. Lady Beach-Mandarin went bouncing back to the\nparticular instance. At present, she said, witness Lady Harman, women\nwere slaves, pampered slaves if you will, but slaves. As things were now\nthere was nothing to keep a man from locking up his wife, opening all\nher letters, dressing her in sack-cloth, separating her from her\nchildren. Most men, of course, didn't do such things, they were amenable\nto public opinion, but Sir Isaac was a jealous little Ogre. He was a\ngnome who had carried off a princess....\n\nShe threw out projects for assailing the Ogre. She would descend\nto-morrow morning upon the Putney house, a living flamboyant writ of\nHabeas Corpus. Mr. Brumley, who had been putting two and two together,\nwas abruptly moved to tell of the sale of Black Strand. \"They may be\nthere,\" he said.\n\n\"He's carried her off,\" cried Lady Beach-Mandarin on a top note. \"It\nmight be the eighteenth century for all he cares. But if it's Black\nStrand,--I'll go to Black Strand....\"\n\nBut she had to talk about it for a week before she actually made her\nraid, and then, with an instinctive need for an audience, she took with\nher a certain Miss Garradice, one of those mute, emotional nervous\nspinsters who drift detachedly, with quick sudden movements, glittering\neyeglasses, and a pent-up imminent look, about our social system. There\nis something about this type of womanhood--it is hard to say--almost as\nthough they were the bottled souls of departed buccaneers grown somehow\nvirginal. She came with Lady Beach-Mandarin quietly, almost humorously,\nand yet it was as if the pirate glittered dimly visible through the\npolished glass of her erect exterior.\n\n\"Here we are!\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin, staring astonished at the once\nfamiliar porch. \"Now for it!\"\n\nShe descended and assailed the bell herself and Miss Garradice stood\nbeside her with the light of combat in her eyes and glasses and cheeks.\n\n\"Shall I offer to take her for a drive!\"\n\n\"_Let's_,\" said Miss Garradice in an enthusiastic whisper. \"_Right away!\nFor ever._\"\n\n\"_I will_,\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin, and nodded desperately.\n\nShe was on the point of ringing again when Snagsby appeared.\n\nHe stood with a large obstructiveness in the doorway. \"Lady 'Arman, my\nlady\" he said with a well-trained deliberation, \"is not a Tome.\"\n\n\"Not at home!\" queried Lady Beach-Mandarin.\n\n\"Not a Tome, my lady,\" repeated Snagsby invincibly.\n\n\"But--when will she be at home?\"\n\n\"I can't say, my lady.\"\n\n\"Is Sir Isaac----?\"\n\n\"Sir Isaac, my lady, is not a Tome. Nobody is a Tome, my lady.\"\n\n\"But we've come from London!\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin.\n\n\"I'm very sorry, my lady.\"\n\n\"You see, I want my friend to see this house and garden.\"\n\nSnagsby was visibly disconcerted. \"I 'ave no instructions, my lady,\" he\ntried.\n\n\"Oh, but Lady Harman would never object----\"\n\nSnagsby's confusion increased. He seemed to be wanting to keep his face\nto the visitors and at the same time glance over his shoulder. \"I will,\"\nhe considered, \"I will enquire, my lady.\" He backed a little, and seemed\ninclined to close the door upon them. Lady Beach-Mandarin was too quick\nfor him. She got herself well into the open doorway. \"And of whom are\nyou going to enquire?\"\n\nA large distress betrayed itself in Snagsby's eye. \"The 'ousekeeper,\" he\nattempted. \"It falls to the 'ousekeeper, my lady.\"\n\nLady Beach-Mandarin turned her face to Miss Garradice, shining in\nsupport. \"Stuff and nonsense,\" she said, \"of course we shall come in.\"\nAnd with a wonderful movement that was at once powerful and perfectly\nlady-like this intrepid woman--\"butted\" is not the word--collided\nherself with Snagsby and hurled him backward into the hall. Miss\nGarradice followed closely behind and at once extended herself in open\norder on Lady Beach-Mandarin's right. \"Go and enquire,\" said Lady\nBeach-Mandarin with a sweeping gesture of her arm. \"Go and enquire.\"\n\nFor a moment Snagsby surveyed the invasion with horror and then fled\nprecipitately into the recesses of the house.\n\n\"Of _course_ they're at home!\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin. \"Fancy\nthat--that--that _navigable_--trying to shut the door on us!\"\n\nFor a moment the two brightly excited ladies surveyed each other and\nthen Lady Beach-Mandarin, with a quickness of movement wonderful in one\nso abundant, began to open first one and then another of the various\ndoors that opened into the long hall-living room. At a peculiar little\ncry from Miss Garradice she turned from a contemplation of the long low\nstudy in which so much of the Euphemia books had been written, to\ndiscover Sir Isaac behind her, closely followed by an agonized Snagsby.\n\n\"A-a-a-a-h!\" she cried, with both hands extended, \"and so you've come\nin, Sir Isaac! That's perfectly delightful. This is my friend Miss\nGarradice, who's _dying_ to see anything you've left of poor Euphemia's\ngarden. And _how_ is dear Lady Harman?\"\n\nFor some crucial moments Sir Isaac was unable to speak and regarded his\nvisitors with an expression that was unpretendingly criminal.\n\nThen he found speech. \"You can't,\" he said. \"It--can't be managed.\" He\nshook his head; his lips were whitely compressed.\n\n\"But all the way from London, Sir Isaac!\"\n\n\"Lady Harman's ill,\" lied Sir Isaac. \"She mustn't be disturbed.\nEverything has to be kept quiet. See? Not even shouting. Not even\nordinarily raised voices. A voice like yours--might kill her. That's why\nSnagsby here said we were not at home. We aren't at home--not to\nanyone.\"\n\nLady Beach-Mandarin was baffled.\n\n\"Snagsby,\" said Sir Isaac, \"open that door.\"\n\n\"But can't I see her--just for a moment?\"\n\nSir Isaac's malignity had softened a little at the prospect of victory.\n\"Absolutely impossible,\" he said. \"Everything disturbs her, every tiny\nthing. You----You'd be certain to.\"\n\nLady Beach-Mandarin looked at her companion and it was manifest that she\nwas at the end of her resources. Miss Garradice after the fashion of\nhighly strung spinsters suddenly felt disappointed in her leader. It\nwasn't, her silence intimated, for her to offer suggestions.\n\nThe ladies were defeated. When at last that stiff interval ended their\ndresses rustled doorward, and Sir Isaac broke out into the civilities of\na victor....\n\nIt was only when they were a mile away from Black Strand that fluent\nspeech returned to Lady Beach-Mandarin. \"The little--Crippen,\" she said.\n\"He's got her locked up in some cellar.... Horrid little face he has! He\nlooked like a rat at bay.\"\n\n\"I think perhaps if we'd done _differently_,\" said Miss Garradice in a\ntone of critical irresponsibility.\n\n\"I'll write to her. That's what I'll do,\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin\ncontemplating her next step. \"I'm really--concerned. And didn't you\nfeel--something sinister. That butler-man's expression--a kind of round\nhorror.\"\n\nThat very evening she told it all--it was almost the trial trip of the\nstory--to Mr. Brumley....\n\nSir Isaac watched their departure furtively from the study window and\nthen ran out to the garden. He went right through into the pine woods\nbeyond and presently, far away up the slopes, he saw his wife loitering\ndown towards him, a gracious white tallness touched by a ray of\nsunlight--and without a suspicion of how nearly rescue had come to her.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a77\n\nSo you see under what excitement Mr. Brumley came down to Black Strand.\n\nLuck was with him at first and he forced the defence with ridiculous\nease.\n\n\"Lady Harman, sir, is not a Tome,\" said Snagsby.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Brumley, with all the assurance of a former proprietor,\n\"then I'll just have a look round the garden,\" and was through the green\ndoor in the wall and round the barn end before Snagsby's mind could\nfunction. That unfortunate man went as far as the green door in pursuit\nand then with a gesture of despair retreated to the pantry and began\ncleaning all his silver to calm his agonized spirit. He could pretend\nperhaps that Mr. Brumley had never rung at the front door at all. If\nnot----\n\nMoreover Mr. Brumley had the good fortune to find Lady Harman quite\nunattended and pensive upon the little seat that Euphemia had placed for\nthe better seeing of her herbaceous borders.\n\n\"Lady Harman!\" he said rather breathlessly, taking both her hands with\nan unwonted assurance and then sitting down beside her, \"I am so glad to\nsee you. I came down to see you--to see if I couldn't be of any service\nto you.\"\n\n\"It's so kind of you to come,\" she said, and her dark eyes said as much\nor more. She glanced round and he too glanced round for Sir Isaac.\n\n\"You see,\" he said. \"I don't know.... I don't want to be impertinent....\nBut I feel--if I can be of any service to you.... I feel perhaps you\nwant help here. I don't want to seem to be taking advantage of a\nsituation. Or making unwarrantable assumptions. But I want to assure\nyou--I would willingly die--if only I could do anything.... Ever since I\nfirst saw you.\"\n\nHe said all this in a distracted way, with his eyes going about the\ngarden for the possible apparition of Sir Isaac, and all the time his\nsense of possible observers made him assume an attitude as though he was\nengaged in the smallest of small talk. Her colour quickened at the\nimport of his words, and emotion, very rich and abundant emotion, its\nvarious factors not altogether untouched perhaps by the spirit of\nlaughter, lit her eyes. She doubted a little what he was saying and yet\nshe had anticipated that somehow, some day, in quite other\ncircumstances, Mr. Brumley might break into some such strain.\n\n\"You see,\" he went on with a quality of appeal in his eyes, \"there's so\nlittle time to say things--without possible interruption. I feel you are\nin difficulties and I want to make you understand----We----Every\nbeautiful woman, I suppose, has a sort of right to a certain sort of\nman. I want to tell you--I'm not really presuming to make love to\nyou--but I want to tell you I am altogether yours, altogether at your\nservice. I've had sleepless nights. All this time I've been thinking\nabout you. I'm quite clear, I haven't a doubt, I'll do anything for you,\nwithout reward, without return, I'll be your devoted brother, anything,\nif only you'll make use of me....\"\n\nHer colour quickened. She looked around and still no one appeared. \"It's\nso kind of you to come like this,\" she said. \"You say things--But I\n_have_ felt that you wanted to be brotherly....\"\n\n\"Whatever I _can_ be,\" assured Mr. Brumley.\n\n\"My situation here,\" she said, her dark frankness of gaze meeting his\ntroubled eyes. \"It's so strange and difficult. I don't know what to do.\nI don't know--what I _want_ to do....\"\n\n\"In London,\" said Mr. Brumley, \"they think--they say--you have been\ntaken off--brought down here--to a sort of captivity.\"\n\n\"I _have_,\" admitted Lady Harman with a note of recalled astonishment in\nher voice.\n\n\"If I can help you to escape----!\"\n\n\"But where can I escape?\"\n\nAnd one must admit that it is a little difficult to indicate a correct\nrefuge for a lady who finds her home intolerable. Of course there was\nMrs. Sawbridge, but Lady Harman felt that her mother's disposition to\nlock herself into her bedroom at the slightest provocation made her a\nweak support for a defensive fight, and in addition that boarding-house\nat Bournemouth did not attract her. Yet what other wall in all the world\nwas there for Lady Harman to set her back against? During the last few\ndays Mr. Brumley's mind had been busy with the details of impassioned\nelopements conducted in the most exalted spirit, but now in the actual\npresence of the lady these projects did in the most remarkable manner\nvanish.\n\n\"Couldn't you,\" he said at last, \"go somewhere?\" And then with an air of\nbeing meticulously explicit, \"I mean, isn't there somewhere, where you\nmight safely go?\"\n\n(And in his dreams he had been crossing high passes with her; he had\nhalted suddenly and stayed her mule. In his dream because he was a man\nof letters and a poet it was always a mule, never a _train de luxe_.\n\"Look,\" he had said, \"below there,--_Italy!_--the country you have never\nseen before.\")\n\n\"There's nowhere,\" she answered.\n\n\"Now _where_?\" asked Mr. Brumley, \"and how?\" with the tone and something\nof the gesture of one who racks his mind. \"If you only trust yourself to\nme----Oh! Lady Harman, if I dared ask it----\"\n\nHe became aware of Sir Isaac walking across the lawn towards them....\n\nThe two men greeted each other with a reasonable cordiality. \"I wanted\nto see how you were getting on down here,\" said Mr. Brumley, \"and\nwhether there was anything I could do for you.\"\n\n\"We're getting on all right,\" said Sir Isaac with no manifest glow of\ngratitude.\n\n\"You've altered the old barn--tremendously.\"\n\n\"Come and see it,\" said Sir Isaac. \"It's a wing.\"\n\nMr. Brumley remained seated. \"It was the first thing that struck me,\nLady Harman. This evidence of Sir Isaac's energy.\"\n\n\"Come and look over it,\" Sir Isaac persisted.\n\nMr. Brumley and Lady Harman rose together.\n\n\"One's enough to show him that,\" said Sir Isaac.\n\n\"I was telling Lady Harman how much we missed her at Lady Viping's, Sir\nIsaac.\"\n\n\"It was on account of the drains,\" Sir Isaac explained. \"You can't--it's\nfoolhardy to stay a day when the drains are wrong, dinners or no\ndinners.\"\n\n\"You know _I_ was extremely sorry not to come to Lady Viping's. I hope\nyou'll tell her. I wrote.\"\n\nBut Mr. Brumley didn't remember clearly enough to make any use of that.\n\n\"Everybody naturally _is_ sorry on an occasion of that sort,\" said Sir\nIsaac. \"But you come and see what we've done in that barn. In three\nweeks. They couldn't have got it together in three months ten years ago.\nIt's--system.\"\n\nMr. Brumley still tried to cling to Lady Harman.\n\n\"Have you been interested in this building?\" he asked.\n\n\"I still don't understand the system of the corridor,\" she said, rising\na little belatedly to the occasion. \"I _will_ come.\"\n\nSir Isaac regarded her for a moment with a dubious expression and then\nbegan to explain the new method of building with large prepared units\nand shaped pieces of reinforced concrete instead of separate bricks that\nMessrs. Prothero & Cuthbertson had organized and which had enabled him\nto create this artistic corridor so simply. It was a rather\nuncomfortable three-cornered conversation. Sir Isaac addressed his\nexposition exclusively to Mr. Brumley and Mr. Brumley made repeated\nineffectual attempts to bring Lady Harman, and Lady Harman made repeated\nineffectual attempts to bring herself, into a position in the\nconversation.\n\nTheir eyes met, the glow of Mr. Brumley's declarations remained with\nthem, but neither dared risk any phrase that might arouse Sir Isaac's\nsuspicions or escape his acuteness. And when they had gone through the\nnew additions pretty thoroughly--the plumbers were still busy with the\nbarn bathroom--Sir Isaac asked Mr. Brumley if there was anything more he\nwould like to see. In the slight pause that ensued Lady Harman suggested\ntea. But tea gave them no opportunity of resuming their interrupted\nconversation, and as Sir Isaac's invincible determination to shadow his\nvisitor until he was well off the premises became more and more\nunmistakable,--he made it quite ungraciously unmistakable,--Mr.\nBrumley's inventiveness failed. One thing came to him suddenly, but it\nled to nothing of any service to him.\n\n\"But I heard you were dangerously ill, Lady Harman!\" he cried. \"Lady\nBeach-Mandarin called here----\"\n\n\"But when?\" asked Lady Harman, astonished over the tea-things.\n\n\"But you _know_ she called!\" said Mr. Brumley and looked in affected\nreproach at Sir Isaac.\n\n\"I've not been ill at all!\"\n\n\"Sir Isaac told her.\"\n\n\"Told her I was ill!\"\n\n\"Dangerously ill. That you couldn't bear to be disturbed.\"\n\n\"But _when_, Mr. Brumley?\"\n\n\"Three days ago.\"\n\nThey both looked at Sir Isaac who was sitting on the music stool and\neating a piece of tea-cake with a preoccupied air. He swallowed and then\nspoke thoughtfully--in a tone of detached observation. Nothing but a\nslight reddening of the eyes betrayed any unusual feeling in him.\n\n\"It's my opinion,\" he said, \"that that old lady--Lady Beach-Mandarin I\nmean--doesn't know what she's saying half the time. She says--oh!\nremarkable things. Saying _that_ for example!\"\n\n\"But did she call on me?\"\n\n\"She called. I'm surprised you didn't hear. And she was all in a flurry\nfor going on.... Did you come down, Mr. Brumley, to see if Lady Harman\nwas ill?\"\n\n\"That weighed with me.\"\n\n\"Well,--you see she isn't,\" said Sir Isaac and brushed a stray crumb\nfrom his coat....\n\nMr. Brumley was at last impelled gateward and Sir Isaac saw him as far\nas the high-road.\n\n\"Good-bye!\" cried Mr. Brumley with excessive amiability.\n\nSir Isaac with soundless lips made a good-bye like gesture.\n\n\"And now,\" said Sir Isaac to himself with extreme bitterness, \"now to\nsee about getting a dog.\"\n\n\"Bull mastiff?\" said Sir Isaac developing his idea as he went back to\nLady Harman. \"Or perhaps a Thoroughly Vicious collie?\"\n\n\"How did that chap get in?\" he demanded. \"What had he got to say to\nyou?\"\n\n\"He came in--to look at the garden,\" said Lady Harman. \"And of course he\nwanted to know if I had been well--because of Lady Viping's party. And I\nsuppose because of what you told Lady Beach-Mandarin.\"\n\nSir Isaac grunted doubtfully. He thought of Snagsby and of all the\ninstructions he had given Snagsby. He turned about and went off swiftly\nand earnestly to find Snagsby....\n\nSnagsby lied. But Sir Isaac was able to tell from the agitated way in\nwhich he was cleaning his perfectly clean silver at that unseasonable\nhour that the wretched man was lying.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a78\n\nQuite a number of words came to the lips of Mr. Brumley as he went\nunwillingly along the pleasant country road that led from Black Strand\nto the railway station. But the word he ultimately said showed how\nstrongly the habits of the gentlemanly _litt\u00c3\u00a9rateur_ prevailed in him.\nIt was the one inevitable word for his mood,--\"Baffled!\"\n\nClose upon its utterance came the weak irritation of the impotent man.\n\"What the _devil_?\" cried Mr. Brumley.\n\nSome critical spirit within him asked him urgently why he was going to\nthe station, what he thought he was doing, what he thought he had done,\nand what he thought he was going to do. To all of which questions Mr.\nBrumley perceived he had no adequate reply.\n\nEarlier in the day he had been inspired by a vague yet splendid dream of\nlarge masterful liberations achieved. He had intended to be very\ndisinterested, very noble, very firm, and so far as Sir Isaac was\nconcerned, a trifle overbearing. You know now what he said and did. \"Of\ncourse if we could have talked for a little longer,\" he said. From the\nstormy dissatisfaction of his retreat this one small idea crystallized,\nthat he had not talked enough without disturbance to Lady Harman. The\nthing he had to do was to talk to her some more. To go on with what he\nhad been saying. That thought arrested his steps. On that hypothesis\nthere was no reason whatever why he should go on to the station and\nLondon. Instead----He stopped short, saw a convenient gate ahead, went\nto it, seated himself upon its topmost rail and attempted a calm survey\nof the situation. He had somehow to continue that conversation with Lady\nHarman.\n\nWas it impossible to do that by going back to the front door of Black\nStrand? His instinct was against that course. He knew that if he went\nback now openly he would see nobody but Sir Isaac or his butler. He must\ntherefore not go back openly. He must go round now and into the\npine-woods at the back of Black Strand; thence he must watch the garden\nand find his opportunity of speaking to the imprisoned lady. There was\nsomething at once attractively romantic and repellently youthful about\nthis course of action. Mr. Brumley looked at his watch, then he surveyed\nthe blue clear sky overhead, with just one warm tinted wisp of cloud. It\nwould be dark in an hour and it was probable that Lady Harman had\nalready gone indoors for the day. Might it be possible after dark to\napproach the house? No one surely knew the garden so well as he.\n\nOf course this sort of thing is always going on in romances; in the\nstories of that last great survivor of the Stevensonian tradition, H.B.\nMarriot Watson, the heroes are always creeping through woods, tapping at\nwindows, and scaling house-walls, but Mr. Brumley as he sat on his gate\nbecame very sensible of his own extreme inexperience in such\nadventures. And yet anything seemed in his present mood better than\ngoing back to London.\n\nSuppose he tried his luck!\n\nHe knew of course the lie of the land about Black Strand very well\nindeed and his harmless literary social standing gave him a certain\nfreedom of trespass. He dropped from his gate on the inner side and\ntaking a bridle path through a pine-wood was presently out upon the\nmoorland behind his former home. He struck the high-road that led past\nthe Staminal Bread Board and was just about to clamber over the barbed\nwire on his left and make his way through the trees to the crest that\ncommanded the Black Strand garden when he perceived a man in a velveteen\ncoat and gaiters strolling towards him. He decided not to leave the road\nuntil he was free from observation. The man was a stranger, an almost\nconventional gamekeeper, and he endorsed Mr. Brumley's remark upon the\ncharmingness of the day with guarded want of enthusiasm. Mr. Brumley\nwent on for some few minutes, then halted, assured himself that the\nstranger was well out of sight and returned at once towards the point\nwhere high-roads were to be left and adventure begun. But he was still\nsome yards away when he became aware of that velveteen-coated figure\napproaching again. \"Damn!\" said Mr. Brumley and slacked his eager paces.\nThis time he expressed a view that the weather was extremely mild.\n\"Very,\" said the man in velveteen with a certain lack of respect in his\nmanner.\n\nIt was no good turning back again. Mr. Brumley went on slowly, affected\nto botanize, watched the man out of sight and immediately made a dash\nfor the pine-woods, taking the barbed wire in a manner extremely\ndetrimental to his left trouser leg. He made his way obliquely up\nthrough the trees to the crest from which he had so often surveyed the\nshining ponds of Aleham. There he paused to peer back for that\ngamekeeper--whom he supposed in spite of reason to be stalking him--to\nrecover his breath and to consider his further plans. The sunset was\nvery fine that night, a great red sun was sinking towards acutely\noutlined hill-crests, the lower nearer distances were veiled in lavender\nmists and three of the ponds shone like the fragments of a shattered\npink topaz. But Mr. Brumley had no eye for landscape....\n\nAbout two hours after nightfall Mr. Brumley reached the railway station.\nHis trousers and the elbow of his coat bore witness to a second transit\nof the barbed-wire fence in the darkness, he had manifestly walked into\na boggy place and had some difficulty in recovering firm ground and he\nhad also been sliding in a recumbent position down a bank of moist\nferruginous sand. Moreover he had cut the palm of his left hand. There\nwas a new strange stationmaster who regarded him without that respect to\nwhich he had grown accustomed. He received the information that the\nwinter train service had been altered and that he would have to wait\nforty-five minutes for the next train to London with the resignation of\na man already chastened by misfortune and fatigue. He went into the\nwaiting-room and after a vain search for the poker--the new\nstationmaster evidently kept it in a different place--sat down in front\nof an irritatingly dull fire banked up with slack, and nursed his\ndamaged hand and meditated on his future plans.\n\nHis plans were still exactly in the state in which they had been when\nSir Isaac parted from him at the gate of Black Strand. They remained in\nthe same state for two whole days. Throughout all that distressing\nperiod his general intention of some magnificent intervention on behalf\nof Lady Harman remained unchanged, it produced a number of moving\nvisions of flights at incredible speeds in (recklessly hired) motor-cars\nof colossal power,--most of the purchase money for Black Strand was\nstill uninvested at his bank--of impassioned interviews with various\npeople, of a divorce court with a hardened judge congratulating the\nmanifestly quite formal co-respondent on the moral beauty of his\nbehaviour, but it evolved no sort of concrete practicable detail upon\nwhich any kind of action might be taken. And during this period of\nindecision Mr. Brumley was hunted through London by a feverish unrest.\nWhen he was in his little flat in Pont Street he was urged to go to his\nclub, when he got to his club he was urged to go anywhere else, he\ncalled on the most improbable people and as soon as possible fled forth\nagain, he even went to the British Museum and ordered out a lot of books\non matrimonial law. Long before that great machine had disgorged them\nfor him he absconded and this neglected, this widowed pile of volumes\nstill standing to his account only came back to his mind in the middle\nof the night suddenly and disturbingly while he was trying to remember\nthe exact words he had used in his brief conversation with Lady\nHarman....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a79\n\nTwo days after Mr. Brumley's visit Susan Burnet reached Black Strand.\nShe too had been baffled for a while. For some week or more she couldn't\ndiscover the whereabouts of Lady Harman and lived in the profoundest\nperplexity. She had brought back her curtains to the Putney house in a\nlarge but luggable bundle, they were all made and ready to put up, and\nshe found the place closed and locked, in the charge of a caretaker\nwhose primary duty it was to answer no questions. It needed several days\nof thought and amazement, and a vast amount of \"I wonder,\" and \"I just\nwould like to know,\" before it occurred to Susan that if she wrote to\nLady Harman at the Putney address the letter might be forwarded. And\neven then she almost wrecked the entire enterprise by mentioning the\nmoney, and it was by a quite exceptional inspiration that she thought\nafter all it was wiser not to say that but to state that she had\nfinished the curtains and done everything (underlined) that Lady Harman\nhad desired. Sir Isaac read it and tossed it over to his wife. \"Make her\nsend her bill,\" he remarked.\n\nWhereupon Lady Harman set Mrs. Crumble in motion to bring Susan down to\nBlack Strand. This wasn't quite easy because as Mrs. Crumble pointed out\nthey hadn't the slightest use for Susan's curtains there, and Lady\nHarman had to find the morning light quite intolerable in her\nbedroom--she always slept with window wide open and curtains drawn\nback--to create a suitable demand for Susan's services. But at last\nSusan came, too humbly invisible for Sir Isaac's attention, and directly\nshe found Lady Harman alone in the room with her, she produced a pawn\nticket and twenty pounds. \"I 'ad to give all sorts of particulars,\" she\nsaid. \"It was a job. But I did it....\"\n\nThe day was big with opportunity, for Sir Isaac had been unable to\nconceal the fact that he had to spend the morning in London. He had gone\nup in the big car and his wife was alone, and so, with Susan upstairs\nstill deftly measuring for totally unnecessary hangings, Lady Harman was\nable to add a fur stole and a muff and some gloves to her tweed\ngardening costume, walk unchallenged into the garden and from the garden\ninto the wood and up the hillside and over the crest and down to the\nhigh-road and past that great advertisement of Staminal Bread and so for\nfour palpitating miles, to the railway station and the outer world.\n\nShe had the good fortune to find a train imminent,--the\ntwelve-seventeen. She took a first-class ticket for London and got into\na compartment with another woman because she felt it would be safer.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a710\n\nLady Harman reached Miss Alimony's flat at half-past three in the\nafternoon. She had lunched rather belatedly and uncomfortably in the\nWaterloo Refreshment Room and she had found out that Miss Alimony was at\nhome through the telephone. \"I want to see you urgently,\" she said, and\nMiss Alimony received her in that spirit. She was hatless but she had a\ngreat cloud of dark fuzzy hair above the grey profundity of her eyes and\nshe wore an artistic tea-gown that in spite of a certain looseness at\nneck and sleeve emphasized the fine lines of her admirable figure. Her\nflat was furnished chiefly with books and rich oriental hangings and\nvast cushions and great bowls of scented flowers. On the mantel-shelf\nwas the crystal that amused her lighter moments and above it hung a\ncircular allegory by Florence Swinstead, very rich in colour, the\nAwakening of Woman, in a heavy gold frame. Miss Alimony conducted her\nguest to an armchair, knelt flexibly on the hearthrug before her, took\nup a small and elegant poker with a brass handle and a spear-shaped\nservice end of iron and poked the fire.\n\nThe service end came out from the handle and fell into the grate. \"It\nalways does that,\" said Miss Alimony charmingly. \"But never mind.\" She\nwarmed both hands at the blaze. \"Tell me all about it,\" she said,\nsoftly.\n\nLady Harman felt she would rather have been told all about it. But\nperhaps that would follow.\n\n\"You see,\" she said, \"I find----My married life----\"\n\nShe halted. It _was_ very difficult to tell.\n\n\"Everyone,\" said Agatha, giving a fine firelit profile, and remaining\ngravely thoughtful through a little pause.\n\n\"Do you mind,\" she asked abruptly, \"if I smoke?\"\n\nWhen she had completed her effect with a delicately flavoured cigarette,\nshe encouraged Lady Harman to proceed.\n\nThis Lady Harman did in a manner do. She said her husband left her no\nfreedom of mind or movement, gave her no possession of herself, wanted\nto control her reading and thinking. \"He insists----\" she said.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Miss Agatha sternly blowing aside her cigarette smoke. \"They\nall insist.\"\n\n\"He insists,\" said Lady Harman, \"on seeing all my letters, choosing all\nmy friends. I have no control over my house or my servants, no money\nexcept what he gives me.\"\n\n\"In fact you are property.\"\n\n\"I'm simply property.\"\n\n\"A harem of one. And all _that_ is within the provisions of the law!\"\n\n\"How any woman can marry!\" said Miss Agatha, after a little interval. \"I\nsometimes think that is where the true strike of the sex ought to begin.\nIf none of us married! If we said all of us, 'No,--definitely--we refuse\nthis bargain! It is a man-made contract. We have had no voice in it. We\ndecline.' Perhaps it will come to that. And I knew that you, you with\nthat quiet beautiful penetration in your eyes would come to see it like\nthat. The first task, after the vote is won, will be the revision of\nthat contract. The very first task of our Women Statesmen....\"\n\nShe ceased and revived her smouldering cigarette and mused blinking\nthrough the smoke. She seemed for a time almost lost to the presence of\nher guest in a great daydream of womanstatecraft.\n\n\"And so,\" she said, \"you've come, as they all come,--to join us.\"\n\n\"_Well_,\" said Lady Harman in a tone that made Agatha turn eyes of\nsurprise upon her.\n\n\"Of course,\" continued Lady Harman, \"I suppose--I shall join you; but as\na matter of fact you see, what I've done to-day has been to come right\naway.... You see I am still in my garden tweeds.... There it was down\nthere, a sort of stale mate....\"\n\nAgatha sat up on her heels.\n\n\"But my dear!\" she said, \"you don't mean you've run away?\"\n\n\"Yes,--I've run away.\"\n\n\"But--run away!\"\n\n\"I sold a ring and got some money and here I am!\"\n\n\"But--what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I thought you perhaps--might advise.\"\n\n\"But--a man like your husband! He'll pursue you!\"\n\n\"If he knows where I am, he will,\" said Lady Harman.\n\n\"He'll make a scandal. My dear! are you wise? Tell me, tell me exactly,\n_why_ have you run away? I didn't understand at all--that you had run\naway.\"\n\n\"Because,\" began Lady Harman and flushed hotly. \"It was impossible,\" she\nsaid.\n\nMiss Alimony regarded her deeply. \"I wonder,\" she said.\n\n\"I feel,\" said Lady Harman, \"if I stayed, if I gave in----I mean\nafter--after I had once--rebelled. Then I should just be--a wife--ruled,\nordered----\"\n\n\"It wasn't your place to give in,\" said Miss Alimony and added one of\nthose parliament touches that creep more and more into feminine\nphraseology; \"I agree to that--_nemine contradicente_. But--I\n_wonder_....\"\n\nShe began a second cigarette and thought in profile again.\n\n\"I think, perhaps, I haven't explained, clearly, how things are,\" said\nLady Harman, and commenced a rather more explicit statement of her case.\nShe felt she had not conveyed and she wanted to convey to Miss Alimony\nthat her rebellion was not simply a desire for personal freedom and\nautonomy, that she desired these things because she was becoming more\nand more aware of large affairs outside her home life in which she ought\nto be not simply interested but concerned, that she had been not merely\nwatching the workings of the business that made her wealthy, but reading\nbooks about socialism, about social welfare that had stirred her\nprofoundly.... \"But he won't even allow me to know of such things,\" she\nsaid....\n\nMiss Alimony listened a little abstractedly.\n\nSuddenly she interrupted. \"Tell me,\" she said, \"one thing.... I\nconfess,\" she explained, \"I've no business to ask. But if I'm to\nadvise----If my advice is to be worth anything....\"\n\n\"Yes?\" asked Lady Harman.\n\n\"Is there----Is there someone else?\"\n\n\"Someone else?\" Lady Harman was crimson.\n\n\"On _your_ side!\"\n\n\"Someone else on my side?\"\n\n\"I mean--someone. A man perhaps? Some man that you care for? More than\nyou do for your husband?...\"\n\n\"_I can't imagine_,\" whispered Lady Harman, \"_anything_----\" And left\nher sentence unfinished. Her breath had gone. Her indignation was\nprofound.\n\n\"Then I can't understand why you should find it so important to come\naway.\"\n\nLady Harman could offer no elucidation.\n\n\"You see,\" said Miss Alimony, with an air of expert knowledge, \"our case\nagainst our opponents is just exactly their great case against us. They\nsay to us when we ask for the Vote, 'the Woman's Place is the Home.'\n'Precisely,' we answer, 'the Woman's Place _is_ the Home. _Give_ us our\nHomes!' Now _your_ place is your home--with your children. That's where\nyou have to fight your battle. Running away--for you it's simply running\naway.\"\n\n\"But----If I stay I shall be beaten.\" Lady Harman surveyed her hostess\nwith a certain dismay. \"Do you understand, Agatha? I _can't_ go back.\"\n\n\"But my dear! What else can you do? What had you thought?\"\n\n\"You see,\" said Lady Harman, after a little struggle with that childish\nquality in her nerves that might, if it wasn't controlled, make her eyes\nbrim. \"You see, I didn't expect you quite to take this view. I thought\nperhaps you might be disposed----If I could have stayed with you here,\nonly for a little time, I could have got some work or something----\"\n\n\"It's so dreadful,\" said Miss Alimony, sitting far back with the\nrelaxation of infinite regrets. \"It's dreadful.\"\n\n\"Of course if you don't see it as I do----\"\n\n\"I can't,\" said Miss Alimony. \"I can't.\"\n\nShe turned suddenly upon her visitor and grasped her knees with her\nshapely hands. \"Oh let me implore you! Don't run away. Please for my\nsake, for all our sakes, for the sake of Womanhood, don't run away! Stay\nat your post. You mustn't run away. You must _not_. If you do, you admit\neverything. Everything. You must fight in your home. It's _your_ home.\nThat is the great principle you must grasp,--it's not his. It's there\nyour duty lies. And there are your children--_your_ children, your\nlittle ones! Think if you go--there may be a fearful fuss--proceedings.\nLawyers--a search. Very probably he will take all sorts of proceedings.\nIt will be a Matrimonial Case. How can I be associated with that? We\nmustn't mix up Women's Freedom with Matrimonial Cases. Impossible! We\n_dare_ not! A woman leaving her husband! Think of the weapon it gives\nour enemies. If once other things complicate the Vote,--the Vote is\nlost. After all our self-denial, after all our sacrifices.... You see!\nDon't you _see_?...\n\n\"_Fight!_\" she summarized after an eloquent interval.\n\n\"You mean,\" said Lady Harman,--\"you think I ought to go back.\"\n\nMiss Alimony paused to get her full effect. \"_Yes_,\" she said in a\nprofound whisper and endorsed it, \"Oh so much so!--yes.\"\n\n\"Now?\"\n\n\"Instantly.\"\n\nFor an interval neither lady spoke. It was the visitor at last who broke\nthe tension.\n\n\"Do you think,\" she asked in a small voice and with the hesitation of\none whom no refusal can surprise; \"you could give me a cup of tea?\"\n\nMiss Alimony rose with a sigh and a slow unfolding rustle. \"I forgot,\"\nshe said. \"My little maid is out.\"\n\nLady Harman left alone sat for a time staring at the fire with her eyes\nrather wide and her eyebrows raised as though she mutely confided to it\nher infinite astonishment. This was the last thing she had expected. She\nwould have to go to some hotel. Can a woman stay alone at an hotel? Her\nheart sank. Inflexible forces seemed to be pointing her back to\nhome--and Sir Isaac. He would be a very triumphant Sir Isaac, and she'd\nnot have much heart left in her.... \"I _won't_ go back,\" she whispered\nto herself. \"Whatever happens I _won't_ go back....\"\n\nThen she became aware of the evening newspaper Miss Alimony had been\nreading. The headline, \"Suffrage Raid on Regent Street,\" caught her eye.\nA queer little idea came into her head. It grew with tremendous\nrapidity. She put out a hand and took up the paper and read.\n\nShe had plenty of time to read because her hostess not only got the tea\nherself but went during that process to her bedroom and put on one of\nthose hats that have contributed so much to remove the stigma of\ndowdiness from the suffrage cause, as an outward and visible sign that\nshe was presently ceasing to be at home....\n\nLady Harman found an odd fact in the report before her. \"One of the most\ndifficult things to buy at the present time in the West End of London,\"\nit ran, \"is a hammer....\"\n\nThen a little further: \"The magistrate said it was impossible to make\ndiscriminations in this affair. All the defendants must have a month's\nimprisonment....\"\n\nWhen Miss Alimony returned Lady Harman put down the paper almost\nguiltily.\n\nAfterwards Miss Alimony recalled that guilty start, and the still more\nguilty start that had happened, when presently she went out of the room\nagain and returned with a lamp, for the winter twilight was upon them.\nAfterwards, too, she was to learn what had become of the service end of\nher small poker, the little iron club, which she missed almost as soon\nas Lady Harman had gone....\n\nLady Harman had taken that grubby but convenient little instrument and\nhidden it in her muff, and she had gone straight out of Miss Alimony's\nflat to the Post Office at the corner of Jago Street, and there, with\none simple effective impact, had smashed a ground-glass window, the\nproperty of His Majesty King George the Fifth. And having done so, she\nhad called the attention of a youthful policeman, fresh from Yorkshire,\nto her offence, and after a slight struggle with his incredulity and a\nvisit to the window in question, had escorted him to the South Hampsmith\npolice-station, and had there made him charge her. And on the way she\nexplained to him with a newfound lucidity why it was that women should\nhave votes.\n\nAnd all this she did from the moment of percussion onward, in a mood of\nexaltation entirely strange to her, but, as she was astonished to find,\nby no means disagreeable. She found afterwards that she only remembered\nvery indistinctly her selection of the window and her preparations for\nthe fatal blow, but that the effect of the actual breakage remained\nextraordinarily vivid upon her memory. She saw with extreme distinctness\nboth as it was before and after the breakage, first as a rather\nirregular grey surface, shining in the oblique light of a street lamp,\nand giving pale phantom reflections of things in the street, and then as\nit was after her blow. It was all visual impression in her memory; she\ncould not recollect afterwards if there had been any noise at all. Where\nthere had been nothing but a milky dinginess a thin-armed, irregular\nstar had flashed into being, and a large triangular piece at its centre,\nafter what seemed an interminable indecision, had slid, first covertly\ndownward, and then fallen forward at her feet and shivered into a\nhundred fragments....\n\nLady Harman realized that a tremendous thing had been done--irrevocably.\nShe stared at her achievement open-mouthed. The creative lump of iron\ndropped from her hand. She had a momentary doubt whether she had really\nwanted to break that window at all; and then she understood that this\nbusiness had to be seen through, and seen through with neatness and\ndignity; and that wisp of regret vanished absolutely in her\nconcentration upon these immediate needs.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a711\n\nSome day, when the arts of the writer and illustrator are more closely\nblended than they are to-day, it will be possible to tell of all that\nfollowed this blow, with an approach to its actual effect. Here there\nshould stand a page showing simply and plainly the lower half of the\nwindow of the Jago Street Post Office, a dark, rather grimy pane,\nreflecting the light of a street lamp--and _broken_. Below the pane\nwould come a band of evilly painted woodwork, a corner of letter-box, a\nfoot or so of brickwork, and then the pavement with a dropped lump of\niron. That would be the sole content of this page, and the next page\nwould be the same, but very slightly fainter, and across it would be\nprinted a dim sentence or so of explanation. The page following that\nwould show the same picture again, but now several lines of type would\nbe visible, and then, as one turned over, the smashed window would fade\na little, and the printed narrative, still darkened and dominated by it,\nwould nevertheless resume. One would read on how Lady Harman returned to\nconvince the incredulous young Yorkshireman of her feat, how a man with\na barrow-load of bananas volunteered comments, and how she went in\ncustody, but with the extremest dignity, to the police-station. Then,\nwith some difficulty, because that imposed picture would still prevail\nover the letterpress, and because it would be in small type, one would\nlearn how she was bailed out by Lady Beach-Mandarin, who was clearly the\nwoman she ought to have gone to in the first place, and who gave up a\ndinner with a duchess to entertain her, and how Sir Isaac, being too\ntorn by his feelings to come near her spent the evening in a frantic\nattempt to keep the whole business out of the papers. He could not\nmanage it. The magistrate was friendly next morning, but inelegant in\nhis friendly expedients; he remanded Lady Harman until her mental\ncondition could be inquired into, but among her fellow-defendants--there\nhad been quite an epidemic of window-smashing that evening--Lady Harman\nshone pre-eminently sane. She said she had broken this window because\nshe was assured that nothing would convince people of the great\ndissatisfaction of women with their conditions except such desperate\nacts, and when she was reminded of her four daughters she said it was\nprecisely the thought of how they too would grow up to womanhood that\nhad made her strike her blow. The statements were rather the outcome of\nher evening with Lady Beach-Mandarin than her own unaided discoveries,\nbut she had honestly assimilated them, and she expressed them with a\ncertain simple dignity.\n\nSir Isaac made a pathetic appearance before the court, and Lady Harman\nwas shocked to see how worn he was with distress at her scandalous\nbehaviour. He looked a broken man. That curious sense of personal\nresponsibility, which had slumbered throughout the Black Strand\nstruggle, came back to her in a flood, and she had to grip the edge of\nthe dock tightly to maintain her self-control. Unaccustomed as he was to\npublic speaking, Sir Isaac said in a low, sorrow-laden voice, he had\nprovided himself with a written statement dissociating himself from the\nviews his wife's rash action might seem to imply, and expressing his own\nopinions upon woman's suffrage and the relations of the sexes generally,\nwith especial reference to contemporary literature. He had been writing\nit most of the night. He was not, however, permitted to read this, and\nhe then made an unstudied appeal for the consideration and mercy of the\ncourt. He said Lady Harman had always been a good mother and a faithful\nwife; she had been influenced by misleading people and bad books and\npublications, the true significance of which she did not understand, and\nif only the court would regard this first offence leniently he was\nready to take his wife away and give any guarantee that might be\nspecified that it should not recur. The magistrate was sympathetic and\nkindly, but he pointed out that this window-breaking had to be stamped\nout, and that it could only be stamped out by refusing any such\nexception as Sir Isaac desired. And so Sir Isaac left the court widowed\nfor a month, a married man without a wife, and terribly distressed.\n\nAll this and more one might tell in detail, and how she went to her\ncell, and the long tedium of her imprisonment, and how deeply Snagsby\nfelt the disgrace, and how Miss Alimony claimed her as a convert to the\nmagic of her persuasions, and many such matters--there is no real\nrestraint upon a novelist fully resolved to be English and Gothic and\nunclassical except obscure and inexplicable instincts. But these obscure\nand inexplicable instincts are at times imperative, and on this occasion\nthey insist that here must come a break, a pause, in the presence of\nthis radiating gap in the Postmaster-General's glass, and the phenomenon\nof this gentle and beautiful lady, the mother of four children, grasping\nin her gloved hand, and with a certain amateurishness, a lumpish\npoker-end of iron.\n\nWe make the pause by ending the chapter here and by resuming the story\nat a fresh point--with an account of various curious phases in the\nmental development of Mr. Brumley.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE NINTH\n\nMR. BRUMLEY IS TROUBLED BY DIFFICULT IDEAS\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a71\n\nThen as that picture of a post office pane, smashed and with a large\nhole knocked clean through it, fades at last upon the reader's\nconsciousness, let another and a kindred spectacle replace it. It is the\ncarefully cleaned and cherished window of Mr. Brumley's mind, square and\ntidy and as it were \"frosted\" against an excess of light, and in that\nalso we have now to record the most jagged all and devastating\nfractures.\n\nLittle did Mr. Brumley reckon when first he looked up from his laces at\nBlack Strand, how completely that pretty young woman in the dark furs\nwas destined to shatter all the assumptions that had served his life.\n\nBut you have already had occasion to remark a change in Mr. Brumley's\nbearing and attitude that carries him far from the kindly and humorous\nconservatism of his earlier work. You have shared Lady Harman's\nastonishment at the ardour of his few stolen words in the garden, an\nastonishment that not only grew but flowered in the silences of her\ncaptivity, and you know something of the romantic impulses, more at\nleast than she did, that gave his appearance at the little local railway\nstation so belated and so disreputable a flavour. In the chilly\nill-flavoured solitude of her prison cell and with a mind quickened by\nmeagre and distasteful fare, Lady Harman had ample leisure to reflect\nupon many things, she had already fully acquainted herself with the\ngreater proportion of Mr. Brumley's published works, and she found the\nutmost difficulty in reconciling the flushed impassioned quality of his\nfew words of appeal, with the moral assumptions of his published\nopinions. On the whole she was inclined to think that her memory had a\nlittle distorted what he had said. In this however she was mistaken; Mr.\nBrumley had really been proposing an elopement and he was now entirely\npreoccupied with the idea of rescuing, obtaining and possessing Lady\nHarman for himself as soon as the law released her.\n\nOne may doubt whether this extensive change from a humorous conservatism\nto a primitive and dangerous romanticism is to be ascribed entirely to\nthe personal charm, great as it no doubt was, of Lady Harman; rather did\nher tall soft dark presence come to release a long accumulating store of\ndiscontent and unrest beneath the polished surfaces of Mr. Brumley's\nmind. Things had been stirring in him for some time; the latter Euphemia\nbooks had lacked much of the freshness of their precursors and he had\nfound it increasingly hard, he knew not why, to keep up the lightness,\nthe geniality, the friendly badinage of successful and accepted things,\nthe sunny disregard of the grim and unamiable aspects of existence,\nthat were the essential merits of that Optimistic Period of our\nliterature in which Mr. Brumley had begun his career. With every\njustification in the world Mr. Brumley had set out to be an optimist,\neven in the _Granta_ his work had been distinguished by its gay yet\nsteadfast superficiality, and his early success, his rapid popularity,\nhad done much to turn this early disposition into a professional\nattitude. He had determined that for all his life he would write for\ncomfortable untroubled people in the character of a light-spirited,\ncomfortable, untroubled person, and that each year should have its book\nof connubial humour, its travel in picturesque places, its fun and its\nsunshine, like roses budding in succession on a stem. He did his utmost\nto conceal from himself the melancholy realization that the third and\nthe fourth roses were far less wonderful than the first and the second,\nand that by continuing the descending series a rose might be attained at\nlast that was almost unattractive, but he was already beginning to\nsuspect that he was getting less animated and a little irritable when\nEuphemia very gently and gracefully but very firmly and rather\nenigmatically died, and after an interval of tender and tenderly\nexpressed regrets he found himself, in spite of the most strenuous\nefforts to keep bright and kindly and optimistic in the best style, dull\nand getting duller--he could disguise the thing no longer. And he\nweighed more. Six--eight--eleven pounds more. He took a flat in London,\ndined and lunched out lightly but frequently, sought the sympathetic\nfriendship of several charming ladies, and involved himself deeply in\nthe affairs of the Academic Committee. Indeed he made a quite valiant\nstruggle to feel that optimism was just where it always had been and\neverything all right and very bright with him and with the world about\nhim. He did not go under without a struggle. But as Max Beerbohm's\ncaricature--the 1908 one I mean--brought out all too plainly, there was\nin his very animation, something of the alert liveliness of the hunted\nman. Do what he would he had a terrible irrational feeling that things,\nas yet scarce imagined things, were after him and would have him. Even\nas he makes his point, even as he gesticulates airily, with his rather\ndistinctively North European nose Beerbohmically enlarged and his\nsensitive nostril in the air, he seems to be looking at something he\ndoes not want to look at, something conceivably pursuing, out of the\ncorner of his eye.\n\nThe thing that was assailing Mr. Brumley and making his old established\nhumour and tenderness seem dull and opaque and giving this new uneasy\nquality to his expression was of course precisely the thing that Sir\nIsaac meant when he talked about \"idees\" and their disturbing influence\nupon all the once assured tranquillities and predominances of Putney\nlife. It was criticism breaking bounds.\n\nAs a basis and substance for the tissue of whimsically expressed\nhappiness and confident appreciation of the good things of life, which\nMr. Brumley had set before himself as his agreeable--and it was to be\nhoped popular and profitable--life-task, certain assumptions had been\nnecessary. They were assumptions he had been very willing to make and\nwhich were being made in the most exemplary way by the writers who were\nsucceeding all about him at the commencement of his career. And these\nassumptions had had such an air then of being quite trustworthy, as\nbeing certain to wash and wear! Already nowadays it is difficult to get\nthem stated; they have become incredible while still too near to justify\nthe incredibility that attaches to history. It was assumed, for example,\nthat in the institutions, customs and culture of the middle Victorian\nperiod, humanity had, so far as the broad lines of things are concerned,\nachieved its goal. There were of course still bad men and\nwomen--individually--and classes one had to recognize as \"lower,\" but\nall the main things were right, general ideas were right; the law was\nright, institutions were right, Consols and British Railway Debentures\nwere right and were going to keep right for ever. The Abolition of\nSlavery in America had been the last great act which had inaugurated\nthis millennium. Except for individual instances the tragic intensities\nof life were over now and done with; there was no more need for heroes\nand martyrs; for the generality of humanity the phase of genial comedy\nhad begun. There might be improvements and refinements ahead, but\nsocial, political and economic arrangement were now in their main\noutlines settled for good and all; nothing better was possible and it\nwas the agreeable task of the artist and the man of letters to assist\nand celebrate this establishment. There was to be much editing of\nShakespear and Charles Lamb, much delightful humour and costume romance,\nand an Academy of refined Fine Writers would presently establish\nbelles-lettres on the reputable official basis, write _finis_ to\ncreative force and undertake the task of stereotyping the language.\nLiterature was to have its once terrible ferments reduced to the quality\nof a helpful pepsin. Ideas were dead--or domesticated. The last wild\nidea, in an impoverished and pitiful condition, had been hunted down and\nkilled in the mobbing of, \"The Woman Who Did.\" For a little time the\nworld did actually watch a phase of English writing that dared nothing,\npenetrated nothing, suppressed everything and aspired at most to Charm,\ncreep like a transitory patch of sunlight across a storm-rent universe.\nAnd vanish....\n\nAt no time was it a perfectly easy task to pretend that the crazy\nmakeshifts of our legal and political systems, the staggering accidents\nof economic relationship, the festering disorder of contemporary\nphilosophy and religious teaching, the cruel and stupid bed of King Og\nthat is our last word in sexual adjustment, really constituted a noble\nand enduring sanity, and it became less and less so with the acute\ndisillusionments that arose out of the Boer War. The first decade of the\ntwentieth century was for the English a decade of badly sprained\noptimism. Our Empire was nearly beaten by a handful of farmers amidst\nthe jeering contempt of the whole world--and we felt it acutely for\nseveral years. We began to question ourselves. Mr. Brumley found his gay\nbut entirely respectable irresponsibility harder and harder to keep up\nas that decade wore on. And close upon the South African trouble came\nthat extraordinary new discontent of women with a woman's lot which we\nhave been observing as it reached and troubled the life of Lady Harman.\nWomen who had hitherto so passively made the bulk of that reading public\nwhich sustained Mr. Brumley and his kind--they wanted something else!\n\nAnd behind and beneath these immediately disconcerting things still more\nsinister hintings and questioning were beginning to pluck at\ncontentment. In 1899 nobody would have dreamt of asking and in 1909 even\nMr. Brumley was asking, \"Are things going on much longer?\" A hundred\nlittle incidents conspired to suggest that a Christianity that had, to\nput it mildly, shirked the Darwinian challenge, had no longer the\npalliating influence demanded of a national religion, and that down\nthere in the deep levels of labour where they built railways to carry\nMr. Brumley's food and earn him dividends, where they made engines and\ninstruments and textiles and drains for his little needs, there was a\nnew, less bounded discontent, a grimmer spirit, something that one tried\nin vain to believe was only the work of \"agitators,\" something that was\nto be pacified no longer by the thin pretences of liberalism, something\nthat might lead ultimately--optimism scarcely dared to ask whither....\n\nMr. Brumley did his best to resist the influence of these darkening\nideas. He tried to keep it up that everything was going well and that\nmost of these shadows and complaints were the mischief of a few\nincurably restless personalities. He tried to keep it up that to belong\nto the working class was a thoroughly jolly thing--for those who were\nused to it. He declared that all who wanted to alter our laws or our\nideas about property or our methods of production were envious and base\nand all who wanted any change between the sexes, foolish or vicious. He\ntried to go on disposing of socialists, agitators, feminists, women's\nsuffragists, educationists and every sort of reformer with a\ngood-humoured contempt. And he found an increasing difficulty in keeping\nhis contempt sufficiently good-humoured. Instead of laughing down at\nfolly and failure, he had moments when he felt that he was rather\nlaughing up--a little wryly--at monstrous things impending. And since\nideas are things of atmosphere and the spirit, insidious wolves of the\nsoul, they crept up to him and gnawed the insides out of him even as he\nposed as their manful antagonist.\n\nInsensibly Mr. Brumley moved with his times. It is the necessary first\nphase in the break-up of any system of unsound assumptions that a number\nof its votaries should presently set about padding its cutting corners\nand relieving the harsh pressure of its injustices by exuberances of\nhumour and sentimentality. Mr. Brumley became charitable and\nromantic,--orthodox still but charitable and romantic. He was all for\nsmashing with the generalization, but now in the particular instance he\nwas more and more for forgiveness. One finds creeping into the later\nEuphemia books a Bret-Harte-like doctrine that a great number of bad\nwomen are really good and a persuasion in the 'Raffles' key that a large\nproportion of criminals are really very picturesque and admirable\nfellows. One wonders how far Mr. Brumley's less ostensible life was\nsoftening in harmony with this exterior change, this tender twilight of\nprinciple. He wouldn't as yet face the sterner fact that most people who\nare condemned by society, whether they are condemned justly or not, are\nby the very gregariousness of man's nature debased, and that a law or\ncustom that stamps you as bad makes you bad. A great state should have\nhigh and humane and considerate laws nobly planned, nobly administered\nand needing none of these shabby little qualifications _sotto voce_. To\nfind goodness in the sinner and justification in the outcast is to\ncondemn the law, but as yet Mr. Brumley's heart failed where his\nintelligence pointed towards that conclusion. He hadn't the courage to\nrevise his assumptions about right and wrong to that extent; he just\nallowed them to get soft and sloppy. He waded, where there should be\nfirm ground. He waded toward wallowing. This is a perilous way of living\nand the sad little end of Euphemia, flushed and coughing, left him no\ndoubt in many ways still more exposed to the temptations of the\nsentimental byway and the emotional gloss. Happily this is a book about\nLady Harman and not an exhaustive monograph upon Mr. Brumley. We will\nat least leave him the refuge of a few shadows.\n\nOccasionally he would write an important signed review for the\n_Twentieth Century_ or the _Hebdomadal Review_, and on one such occasion\nhe took in hand several studies of contemporary conditions by various\n'New Witnesses,' 'Young Liberals,' _New Age_ rebels and associated\ninsurgent authors. He intended to be rather kindly with them, rather\ndisillusioned, quite sympathetic but essentially conventional and\nconservative and sane. He sat at a little desk near the drooping Venus,\nunder the benediction of Euphemia's posthumous rose, and turned over the\npages of one of the least familiar of the group. The stuff was written\nwith a crude force that at times became almost distinguished, but with a\nbitterness that he felt he must reprove. And suddenly he came upon a\npassionate tirade against the present period. It made him nibble softly\nwith his lips at the top of his fountain pen as he read.\n\n\"We live,\" said the writer, \"in a second Byzantine age, in one of those\nmultitudinous accumulations of secondary interests, of secondary\nactivities and conventions and colossal intricate insignificances, that\nlie like dust heaps in the path of the historian. The true history of\nsuch periods is written in bank books and cheque counterfoils and burnt\nto save individual reputations; it sneaks along under a thousand\npretences, it finds its molelike food and safety in the dirt; its outer\nforms remain for posterity, a huge d\u00c3\u00a9bris of unfathomable riddles.\"\n\n\"Hm!\" said Mr. Brumley. \"He slings it out. And what's this?\"\n\n\"A civilization arrested and decayed, waiting through long inglorious\nages of unscheduled crime, unchallenged social injustice, senseless\nluxury, mercenary politics and universal vulgarity and weakness, for the\nlong overdue scavenging of the Turk.\"\n\n\"I wonder where the children pick up such language,\" whispered Mr.\nBrumley with a smile.\n\nBut presently he had pushed the book away and was thinking over this\nnovel and unpleasant idea that perhaps after all his age didn't matter\nas some ages have mattered and as he had hitherto always supposed it did\nmatter. Byzantine, with the gold of life stolen and the swans changed to\ngeese? Of course always there had been a certain qualification upon\nheroes, even C\u00c3\u00a6sar had needed a wreath, but at any rate the age of C\u00c3\u00a6sar\nhad mattered. Kings no doubt might be more kingly and the issues of life\nplainer and nobler, but this had been true of every age. He tried to\nweigh values against values, our past against our present, temperately\nand sanely. Our art might perhaps be keener for beauty than it seemed to\nbe, but still--it flourished. And our science at least was\nwonderful--wonderful. There certainly this young detractor of existing\nthings went astray. What was there in Byzantium to parallel with the\nelectric light, the electric tram, wireless telegraphy, aseptic surgery?\nOf course this about \"unchallenged social injustice\" was nonsense. Rant.\nWhy! we were challenging social injustice at every general\nelection--plainly and openly. And crime! What could the man mean about\nunscheduled crime? Mere words! There was of course a good deal of\nluxury, but not _wicked_ luxury, and to compare our high-minded and\nconstructive politics with the mere conflict of unscrupulous adventurers\nabout that semi-oriental throne! It was nonsense!\n\n\"This young man must be spanked,\" said Mr. Brumley and, throwing aside\nan open illustrated paper in which a full-length portrait of Sir Edward\nCarson faced a picture of the King and Queen in their robes sitting side\nby side under a canopy at the Coronation Durbar, he prepared himself to\nwrite in an extremely salutary manner about the follies of the younger\ngeneration, and incidentally to justify his period and his professional\ncontentment.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a72\n\nOne is reminded of those houses into which the white ants have eaten\ntheir way; outwardly still fair and solid, they crumble at the touch of\na hand. And now you will begin to understand those changes of bearing\nthat so perplexed Lady Harman, that sudden insurgence of flushed\nhalf-furtive passion in the garden, through the thin pretences of a\nliberal friendship. His hollow honour had been gripped and had given\nway.\n\nHe had begun so well. At first Lady Harman had occupied his mind in the\nproperest way. She was another man's wife and sacred--according to all\nhonourable standards, and what he wanted was merely to see more of her,\ntalk to her, interest her in himself, share whatever was available\noutside her connubial obligations,--and think as little of Sir Isaac as\npossible.\n\nHow quickly the imaginative temperament of Mr. Brumley enlarged that to\ninclude a critical hostility to Sir Isaac, we have already recorded.\nLady Harman was no longer simply a charming, suppressed young wife,\ncrying out for attentive development; she became an ill-treated\nbeautiful woman--misunderstood. Still scrupulously respecting his own\nstandards, Mr. Brumley embarked upon the dangerous business of inventing\njust how Sir Isaac might be outraging them, and once his imagination had\nstarted to hunt in that field, it speedily brought in enough matter for\na fine state of moral indignation, a white heat of not altogether\njustifiable chivalry. Assisted by Lady Beach-Mandarin Mr. Brumley had\nsoon converted the little millionaire into a matrimonial ogre to keep an\nanxious lover very painfully awake at nights. Because by that time and\nquite insensibly he had become an anxious lover--with all the gaps in\nthe thread of realities that would have made him that, quite generously\nfilled up from the world of reverie.\n\nMoral indignation is jealousy with a halo. It is the peculiar snare of\nthe perplexed orthodox, and soon Mr. Brumley was in a state of nearly\nunendurable moral indignation with Sir Isaac for a hundred exaggerations\nof what he was and of what conceivably he might have done to his silent\nyet manifestly unsuitably mated wife. And now that romantic streak which\nis as I have said the first certain symptom of decay in a system of\nmoral assumptions began to show itself in Mr. Brumley's thoughts and\nconversation. \"A marriage like that,\" said Mr. Brumley to Lady\nBeach-Mandarin, \"isn't a marriage. It flouts the True Ideal of Marriage.\nIt's slavery--following a kidnapping....\"\n\nBut this is a wide step from the happy optimism of the Cambridge days.\nWhat becomes of the sanctity of marriage and the institution of the\nfamily when respectable gentlemen talk of something called \"True\nMarriage,\" as non-existent in relation to a lady who is already the\nmother of four children? I record this lapsing of Mr. Brumley into\nromanticism without either sympathy or mitigation. The children, it\npresently became apparent, were not \"true\" children. \"Forced upon her,\"\nsaid Mr. Brumley. \"It makes one ill to think of it!\" It certainly very\nnearly made him ill. And as if these exercises in distinction had\ninflamed his conscience Mr. Brumley wrote two articles in the\n_Hebdomadal_ denouncing impure literature, decadence, immorality,\nvarious recent scandalous instances, and the suffragettes, declaring\nthat woman's place was the home and that \"in a pure and exalted monogamy\nlies the sole unitary basis for a civilized state.\" The most remarkable\nthing about this article is an omission. That Sir Isaac's monogamy with\nany other instances that might be akin to it was not pure and exalted,\nand that it needed--shall we call it readjustment? is a view that in\nthis article Mr. Brumley conspicuously doesn't display. It's as if for a\nmoment, pen in hand, he had eddied back to his old absolute\npositions....\n\nIn a very little while Mr. Brumley and Lady Beach-Mandarin had almost\npersuaded each other that Sir Isaac was applying physical torture to his\nproudly silent wife, and Mr. Brumley was no longer dreaming and glancing\nat but steadily facing the possibility of a pure-minded and handsomely\ndone elopement to \"free\" Lady Harman, that would be followed in due\ncourse by a marriage, a \"true marriage\" on a level of understanding far\nabove any ordinary respectable wedding, amidst universal sympathy and\nadmiration and the presence of all the very best people. In these\nanticipations he did rather remarkably overlook the absence of any sign\nof participation on the part of Lady Harman in his own impassioned\npersonal feelings, and he overlooked still more remarkably as possible\nobjections to his line of conduct, Millicent, Florence, Annette and\nBaby. These omissions no doubt simplified but also greatly falsified his\noutlook.\n\nThis proposal that all the best people shall applaud the higher\nrightness that was to be revealed in his projected elopement, is in the\nvery essence of the romantic attitude. All other people are still to\nremain under the law. There is to be nothing revolutionary. But with\nexceptional persons under exceptional conditions----\n\nMr. Brumley stated his case over and over again to his utmost\nsatisfaction, and always at great moral altitudes and with a kind of\ntranscendent orthodoxy. The more difficult any aspect of the affair\nappeared from the orthodox standpoint the more valiantly Mr. Brumley\nsoared; if it came to his living with Lady Harman for a time before they\ncould be properly married amidst picturesque foreign scenery in a little\n_casa_ by the side of a stream, then the water in that stream was to be\nquite the purest water conceivable and the scenery and associations as\nmorally faultless as a view that had passed the exacting requirements of\nMr. John Ruskin. And Mr. Brumley was very clear in his mind that what he\nproposed to do was entirely different in quality even if it was similar\nin form from anything that anyone else had ever done who had ever before\nmade a scandal or appeared in the divorce court. This is always the way\nin such cases--always. The scandal was to be a noble scandal, a proud\nscandal, one of those instances of heroical love that turn aside\nmisdemeanours--admittedly misdemeanours--into edifying marvels.\n\nThis was the state of mind to which Mr. Brumley had attained when he\nmade his ineffectual raid upon Black Strand, and you will remark about\nit, if you are interested in the changes in people's ideas that are\ngoing on to-day, that although he was prepared to make the most\nextensive glosses in this particular instance upon the commonly accepted\nrules of what is right and proper, he was not for a moment prepared to\naccord the terrible gift of an independent responsibility to Lady\nHarman. In that direction lay regions that Mr. Brumley had still to\nexplore. Lady Harman he considered was married wrongly and disastrously\nand this he held to be essentially the fault of Sir Isaac--with perhaps\nsome slight blame attaching to Lady Harman's mother. The only path of\nescape he could conceive as yet for Lady Harman lay through the chivalry\nof some other man. That a woman could possibly rebel against one man\nwithout the sympathy and moral maintenance of another was still outside\nthe range of Mr. Brumley's understanding. It is still outside the range\nof most men's understandings--and of a great many women's. If he\ngeneralized at all from these persuasions it was in the direction that\nin the interest of \"true marriage\" there should be greater facilities\nfor divorce and also a kind of respectable-ization of divorce. Then\nthese \"false marriages\" might be rectified without suffering. The\nreasons for divorce he felt should be extended to include things not\ngenerally reprehensible, and chivalrous people coming into court should\nbe protected from the indelicate publicity of free reporting....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a73\n\nMr. Brumley was still contemplating rather inconclusively the\npossibility of a long and intimate talk leading up to and preparing for\nan elopement with Lady Harman, when he read of her Jago Street escapade\nand of her impending appearance at the South Hampsmith police court. He\nwas astonished. The more he contemplated the thing the greater became\nhis astonishment.\n\nEven at the first impact he realized that the line she had taken wasn't\nquite in the picture with the line he had proposed for her. He\nfelt--left out. He felt as though a door had slammed between himself and\naffairs to which he had supposed himself essential. He could not\nunderstand why she had done this thing instead of coming straight to his\nflat and making use of all that chivalrous service she surely knew was\nat her disposal. This self-reliance, this direct dealing with the world,\nseemed to him, even in the height of his concern, unwomanly, a deeper\ninjury to his own abandoned assumptions than any he had contemplated. He\nfelt it needed explanation, and he hurried to secure an elbowed\nunsavoury corner in the back of the court in order to hear her defence.\nHe had to wait through long stuffy spaces of time before she appeared.\nThere were half a dozen other window smashers,--plain or at least\nuntidy-looking young women. The magistrate told them they were silly and\nthe soul of Mr. Brumley acquiesced. One tried to make a speech, and it\nwas such a poor speech--squeaky....\n\nWhen at last Lady Harman entered the box--the strangest place it seemed\nfor her--he tried to emerge from the jostling crowd about him into\nvisibility, to catch her eye, to give her the support of his devoted\npresence. Twice at least she glanced in his direction but gave no sign\nof seeing him. He was surprised that she could look without fear or\ndetestation, indeed once with a gesture of solicitude, at Sir Isaac. She\nwas astonishingly serene. There seemed to be just the faintest shadow of\na smile about her lips as the stipendiary explained the impossibility\nof giving her anything less than a month. An uneasy object like the\nsmashed remains of a colossal box of bonbons that was riding out a gale,\ndown in the middle of the court, turned round at last completely and\nrevealed itself as the hat of Lady Beach-Mandarin, but though Mr.\nBrumley waved his hand he could not even make that lady aware of his\npresence. A powerful rude criminal-looking man who stood in front of him\nand smelt grossly of stables, would not give him a fair chance of\nshowing himself, and developed a strong personal hostility to him on\naccount of his alleged \"shoving about.\" It would not he felt be of the\nslightest help to Lady Harman for him to involve himself in a personal\nstruggle with a powerful and powerfully flavoured criminal.\n\nIt was all very dreadful.\n\nAfter the proceedings were over and Lady Harman had been led away into\ncaptivity, he went out and took a taxi in an agitated distraught manner\nto Lady Beach-Mandarin's house.\n\n\"She meant,\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin, \"to have a month's holiday from\nhim and think things out. And she's got it.\"\n\nPerhaps that was it. Mr. Brumley could not tell, and he spent some days\nin that state of perplexity which, like the weariness that heralds a\ncold, marks so often the onset of a new series of ideas....\n\nWhy hadn't she come to him? Had he after all rather overloaded his\nmemory of her real self with imaginative accessories? Had she really\nunderstood what he had been saying to her in the garden? Afterwards\nwhen he had met her eyes as he and she went over the new wing with Sir\nIsaac she had so manifestly--and, when one came to think of it, so\ntranquilly--seemed to understand....\n\nIt was such an extraordinary thing to go smashing a window like\nthat--when there he was at hand ready to help her. She knew his address?\nDid she? For a moment Mr. Brumley cherished that wild surmise. Was that\nperhaps it? But surely she could have looked in the Telephone Directory\nor Who's Who....\n\nBut if that was the truth of the matter she would have looked and\nbehaved differently in court--quite differently. She would have been\nlooking for him. She would have seen him....\n\nIt was queer too to recall what she had said in court about her\ndaughters....\n\nCould it be, he had a frightful qualm, that after all--he wasn't the\nman? How little he knew of her really....\n\n\"This wretched agitation,\" said Mr. Brumley, trying to flounder away\nanyhow from these disconcerting riddles; \"it seems to unbalance them\nall.\"\n\nBut he found it impossible to believe that Lady Harman was seriously\nunbalanced.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a74\n\nAnd if Mr. Brumley's system of romantically distorted moral assumptions\nwas shattered by Lady Harman's impersonal blow at a post office window\nwhen all the rules seemed to require her to fly from the oppression of\none man to the chivalry of another, what words can convey the\ndevastating effect upon him of her conduct after her release? To that\ncrisis he had been looking forward continually; to record the variety of\nhis expectations would fill a large volume, but throughout them all\nprevailed one general idea, that when she came out of prison her\nstruggle with her husband would be resumed, and that this would give Mr.\nBrumley such extraordinary opportunities of displaying his devotion that\nher response, which he was now beginning to suspect might be more\nreluctant than his earlier dreams had assumed, was ultimately\ninevitable. In all these dreams and meditations that response figured as\nthe crown. He had to win and possess Lady Harman. The idea had taken\nhold of his busy yet rather pointless life, had become his directing\nobject. He was full of schemes for presently arresting and captivating\nher imagination. He was already convinced that she cared for him; he had\nto inflame interest and fan liking into the fire of passion. And with a\nmind so occupied, Mr. Brumley wrote this and that and went about his\naffairs. He spent two days and a night at Margate visiting his son at\nhis preparatory school, and he found much material for musing in the\nquestion of just how the high romantic affairs ahead of him would affect\nthis delicately intelligent boy. For a time perhaps he might misjudge\nhis father.... He spent a week-end with Lady Viping and stayed on until\nWednesday and then he came back to London. His plans were still unformed\nwhen the day came for Lady Harman's release, and indeed beyond an idea\nthat he would have her met at the prison gates by an enormous bunch of\nsnowy-white and crimson chrysanthemums he had nothing really concrete at\nall in his mind.\n\nShe had, however, been released stealthily a day before her time, and\nthis is what she had done. She had asked that--of all improbable\npeople!--Sir Isaac's mother should meet her, the biggest car had come to\nthe prison gates, and she had gone straight down with Mrs. Harman to her\nhusband--who had taken a chill and was in bed drinking Contrex\u00c3\u00a9ville\nwater--at Black Strand.\n\nAs these facts shaped themselves in answer to the blanched inquiries of\nMr. Brumley his amazement grew. He began to realize that there must have\nbeen a correspondence during her incarceration, that all sorts of things\nhad been happening while he had been dreaming, and when he went round to\nLady Beach-Mandarin, who was just packing up to be the life and soul of\na winter-sports party at a nice non-Lunnite hotel at Lenzerheide, he\nlearnt particulars that chilled him to the marrow. \"They've made it up,\"\nsaid Lady Beach-Mandarin.\n\n\"But how?\" gasped Mr. Brumley, with his soul in infinite distress. \"But\nhow?\"\n\n\"The Ogre, it seems, has come to see that bullying won't do. He's given\nin tremendously. He's let her have her way with the waitress strike and\nshe's going to have an allowance of her own and all kinds of things.\nIt's settled. It's his mother and that man Charterson talked him over.\nYou know--his mother came to me--as her friend. For advice. Wanted to\nfind out what sort of things we might have been putting in her head. She\nsaid so. A curious old thing--vulgar but--_wise_. I liked her. He's her\ndarling--and she just knows what he is.... He doesn't like it but he's\ntaken his dose. The thought of her going to prison again----! He's let\nher do anything rather than that....\"\n\n\"And she's gone to him!\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin with what he felt to be deliberate\nbrutality. Surely she must have understood----\n\n\"But the waitress strike--what has it got to do with the waitress\nstrike?\"\n\n\"She cared--tremendously.\"\n\n\"_Did_ she?\"\n\n\"Tremendously. And they all go back and the system of inspection is\nbeing altered, and he's even forgiven Babs Wheeler. It made him ill to\ndo it but he did.\"\n\n\"And she's gone back to him.\"\n\n\"Like Godiva,\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin with that sweeping allusiveness\nthat was part of her complicated charm.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a75\n\nFor three days Mr. Brumley was so staggered by these things that it did\nnot occur to him that it was quite possible for him to see Lady Harman\nfor himself and find out just how things stood. He remained in London\nwith an imagination dazed. And as it was the Christmas season and as\nGeorge Edmund in a rather expectant holiday state had now come up from\nMargate, Mr. Brumley went in succession to the Hippodrome, to Peter Pan\nand to an exhibition at Olympia, assisted at an afternoon display of the\nkinemacolor at La Scala Theatre, visited Hamley's and lunched George\nEdmund once at the Criterion and twice at the Climax Club, while\nthinking of nothing in all the world but the incalculable strangeness of\nwomen. George Edmund thought him a very passive leadable parent indeed,\nless querulous about money matters and altogether much improved. The\nglitter and colour of these various entertainments reflected themselves\nupon the surface of that deep flood of meditation, hook-armed\nwooden-legged pirates, intelligent elephants, ingenious but extremely\nexpensive toys, flickering processions, comic turns, snatches of popular\nmusic and George Edmund's way of eating an orange, pictured themselves\non his mind confusedly without in any way deflecting its course. Then on\nthe fourth day he roused himself, gave George Edmund ten shillings to\nget himself a cutlet at the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Royal and do the cinematographs round\nand about the West End, and so released reached Aleham in time for a\ntemperate lunch. He chartered the Aleham car to take him to Black Strand\nand arrived there about a quarter past three, in a great effort to feel\nhimself a matter-of-course visitor.\n\nIt ought to be possible to record that Mr. Brumley's mind was full of\nthe intensest sense of Lady Harman during that journey and of nothing\nelse, but as a matter of fact his mind was now curiously detached and\nreflective, the tensions and expectation of the past month and the\nastonishment of the last few days had worked themselves out and left him\nas it were the passive instrument of the purpose of his more impassioned\nmoods. This distressed lover approached Black Strand in a condition of\nphilosophical lassitude.\n\nThe road from Aleham to Black Strand is a picturesque old English road,\nneedlessly winding and badly graded, wriggling across a healthy\nwilderness with occasional pine-woods. Something in that familiar\nlandscape--for his life had run through it since first he and Euphemia\non a tandem bicycle and altogether very young had sought their ideal\nhome in the South of England--set his mind swinging and generalizing.\nHow freshly youthful he and Euphemia had been when first he came along\nthat road, how crude, how full of happy expectations of success; it had\nbeen as bright and it was now as completely gone as the sunsets they had\nseen together.\n\nHow great a thing life is! How much greater than any single romance, or\nany individual affection! Since those days he had grown, he had\nsucceeded, he had suffered in a reasonable way of course, still he could\nrecall with a kind of satisfaction tears and deep week-long moods of\nhopeless melancholy--and he had changed. And now dominating this\nlandscape, filling him with new emotions and desires and perplexing\nintimations of ignorance and limitations he had never suspected in his\nyouth, was this second figure of a woman. She was different from\nEuphemia. With Euphemia everything had been so simple and easy; until\nthat slight fading, that fatigue of entire success and satisfaction, of\nthe concluding years. He and Euphemia had always kept it up that they\nhad no thought in the world except for one another.... Yet if that had\nbeen true, why hadn't he died when she did. He hadn't died--with\nremarkable elasticity. Clearly in his case there had been these\nunexplored, unsuspected hinterlands of possibility towards which Lady\nHarman seemed now to be directing him. It came to him that afternoon as\nan entirely fresh thought that there might also have been something in\nEuphemia beyond their simple, so charmingly treated relationship. He\nbegan to recall moments when Euphemia had said perplexing little things,\nhad looked at him with an expression that was unexpected, had\nbeen--difficult....\n\nI write of Mr. Brumley to tell you things about him and not to explain\nhim. It may be that the appetite for thorough good talks with people\ngrows upon one, but at any rate it did occur to Mr. Brumley on his way\nto talk to Lady Harman, it occurred to him as a thing distressingly\nirrevocable that he could now never have a thorough good talk with\nEuphemia about certain neglected things between them. It would have\nhelped him so much....\n\nHis eyes rested as he thought of these things upon the familiar purple\nhill crests, patched that afternoon with the lingering traces of a\nrecent snowstorm, the heather slopes, the dark mysterious woods, the\npatches of vivid green where a damp and marshy meadow or so broke the\nmoorland surface. To-day in spite of the sun there was a bright\nblue-white line of frost to the northward of every hedge and bank, the\ntrees were dripping down the white edgings of the morning into the\npine-needle mud at their feet; he had seen it so like this before; years\nhence he might see it all like this again; all this great breezy\ncountryside had taken upon itself a quality of endurance, as though it\nwould still be real and essential in his mind when Lady Harman had\naltogether passed again. It would be real when he himself had passed\naway, and in other costumes and other vehicles fresh Euphemias and new\ncrude George Brumleys would come along, feeling in the ultimate bright\nnew wisdom of youth that it was all for them--a subservient scenery,\nwhen really it was entirely indifferent in its careless permanence to\nall their hopes and fancies....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a76\n\nMr. Brumley's thoughts on the permanence of landscape and the mutability\nof human affairs were more than a little dashed when he came within\nsight of Black Strand and perceived that once cosily beautiful little\nhome clipped and extended, its shrubbery wrecked and the old barn now\npierced with windows and adorned--for its new chimneys were not working\nvery well--by several efficient novelties in chimney cowls. Up the\nslopes behind Sir Isaac had extended his boundaries, and had been\nfelling trees and levelling a couple of tennis courts for next summer.\n\nSomething was being done to the porch, and the jasmine had been cleared\naway altogether. Mr. Brumley could not quite understand what was in\nprogress; Sir Isaac he learnt afterwards had found a wonderful bargain\nin a real genuine Georgian portal of great dignity and simplicity in\nAleham, and he was going to improve Black Strand by transferring it\nthither--with the utmost precaution and every piece numbered--from its\noriginal situation. Mr. Brumley stood among the preparatory d\u00c3\u00a9bris of\nthis and rang a quietly resolute electric bell, which was answered no\nlonger by Mrs. Rabbit but by the ample presence of Snagsby.\n\nSnagsby in that doorway had something of the preposterous effect of a\nvery large face beneath a very small hat. He had to Mr. Brumley's eyes a\nrestored look, as though his self-confidence had been thoroughly done up\nsince their last encounter. Bygones were bygones. Mr. Brumley was\nadmitted as one is admitted to any normal home. He was shown into the\nlittle study-drawing-room with the stepped floor, which had been so\nlargely the scene of his life with Euphemia, and he was left there for\nthe better part of a quarter of an hour before his hostess appeared.\n\nThe room had been changed very little. Euphemia's solitary rose had\ngone, and instead there were several bowls of beaten silver scattered\nabout, each filled with great chrysanthemums from London. Sir Isaac's\njackdaw acquisitiveness had also overcrowded the corner beyond the\nfireplace with a very fine and genuine Queen Anne cabinet; there were a\nnovel by Elizabeth Robins and two or three feminist and socialist works\nlying on the table which would certainly not have been visible, though\nthey might have been in the house, during the Brumley r\u00c3\u00a9gime. Otherwise\nthings were very much as they always had been.\n\nA room like this, thought Mr. Brumley among much other mental driftage,\nis like a heart,--so long as it exists it must be furnished and\ntenanted. No matter what has been, however bright and sweet and tender,\nthe spaces still cry aloud to be filled again. The very essence of life\nis its insatiability. How complete all this had seemed in the moment\nwhen first he and Euphemia had arranged it. And indeed how complete life\nhad seemed altogether at seven-and-twenty. Every year since then he had\nbeen learning--or at any rate unlearning. Until at last he was beginning\nto realize he had still everything to learn....\n\nThe door opened and the tall dark figure of Lady Harman stood for a\nmoment in the doorway before she stepped down into the room.\n\nShe had always the same effect upon him, the effect of being suddenly\nremembered. When he was away from her he was always sure that she was a\nbeautiful woman, and when he saw her again he was always astonished to\nsee how little he had borne her beauty in mind. For a moment they\nregarded one another silently. Then she closed the door behind her and\ncame towards him.\n\nAll Mr. Brumley's philosophizing had vanished at the sight of her. His\nspirit was reborn within him. He thought of her and of his effect upon\nher, vividly, and of nothing else in the world.\n\nShe was paler he thought beneath her dusky hair, a little thinner and\ngraver....\n\nThere was something in her manner as she advanced towards him that told\nhim he mattered to her, that his coming there was something that moved\nher imagination as well as his own. With an almost impulsive movement\nshe held out both her hands to him, and with an inspiration as sudden he\ntook them and kissed them. When he had done so he was ashamed of his\ntemerity; he looked up to meet in her dark eyes the scared shyness of a\nfallow deer. She suddenly remembered to withdraw her hands, and it\nbecame manifest to both of them that the incident must never have\nhappened. She went to the window, stood almost awkwardly for a moment\nlooking out of it, then turned. She put her hands on the back of the\nchair and stood holding it.\n\n\"I knew you would come to see me,\" she said.\n\n\"I've been very anxious about you,\" he said, and on that their minds\nrested through a little silence.\n\n\"You see,\" he explained, \"I didn't know what was happening to you. Or\nwhat you were doing.\"\n\n\"After asking your advice,\" she said.\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"I don't know why I broke that window. Except I think that I wanted to\nget away.\"\n\n\"But why didn't you come to me?\"\n\n\"I didn't know where you were. And besides--I didn't somehow want to\ncome to you.\"\n\n\"But wasn't it wretched in prison? Wasn't it miserably cold? I used to\nthink of you of nights in some wretched ill-aired cell.... You....\"\n\n\"It _was_ cold,\" she admitted. \"But it was very good for me. It was\nquiet. The first few days seemed endless; then they began to go by\nquickly. Quite quickly at last. And I came to think. In the day there\nwas a little stool where one sat. I used to sit on that and brood and\ntry to think things out--all sorts of things I've never had the chance\nto think about before.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Brumley.\n\n\"All this,\" she said.\n\n\"And it has brought you back here!\" he said, with something of the tone\nof one who has a right to enquire, with some flavour too of reproach.\n\n\"You see,\" she said after a little pause, \"during that time it was\npossible to come to understandings. Neither I nor my husband had\nunderstood the other. In that interval it was possible--to explain.\n\n\"Yes. You see, Mr. Brumley, we--we both misunderstood. It was just\nbecause of that and because I had no one who seemed able to advise me\nthat I turned to you. A novelist always seems so wise in these things.\nHe seems to know so many lives. One can talk to you as one can scarcely\ntalk to anyone; you are a sort of doctor--in these matters. And it was\nnecessary--that my husband should realize that I had grown up and that I\nshould have time to think just how one's duty and one's--freedom have to\nbe fitted together.... And my husband is ill. He has been ill, rather\nshort of breath--the doctor thinks it is asthma--for some time, and all\nthe agitation of this business has upset him and made him worse. He is\nupstairs now--asleep. Of course if I had thought I should make him ill I\ncould never have done any of this. But it's done now and here I am, Mr.\nBrumley, back in my place. With all sorts of things changed. Put\nright....\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Mr. Brumley stupidly.\n\nHer speech was like the falling of an opaque curtain upon some romantic\nspectacle. She stood there, almost defensively behind her chair as she\nmade it. There was a quality of premeditation in her words, yet\nsomething in her voice and bearing made him feel that she knew just how\nit covered up and extinguished his dreams and impulses. He heard her out\nand then suddenly his spirit rebelled against her decision. \"No!\" he\ncried.\n\nShe waited for him to go on.\n\n\"You see,\" he said, \"I thought that it was just that you wanted to get\naway----That this life was intolerable----That you were----Forgive me if\nI seem to be going beyond--going beyond what I ought to be thinking\nabout you. Only, why should I pretend? I care, I care for you\ntremendously. And it seemed to me that you didn't love your husband,\nthat you were enslaved and miserable. I would have done anything to help\nyou--anything in the world, Lady Harman. I know--it may sound\nridiculous--there have been times when I would have faced death to feel\nyou were happy and free. I thought all that, I felt all that,--and\nthen--then you come back here. You seem not to have minded. As though I\nhad misunderstood....\"\n\nHe paused and his face was alive with an unwonted sincerity. His\nself-consciousness had for a moment fallen from him.\n\n\"I know,\" she said, \"it _was_ like that. I knew you cared. That is why I\nhave so wanted to talk to you. It looked like that....\"\n\nShe pressed her lips together in that old familiar hunt for words and\nphrases.\n\n\"I didn't understand, Mr. Brumley, all there was in my husband or all\nthere was in myself. I just saw his hardness and his--his hardness in\nbusiness. It's become so different now. You see, I forgot he has bad\nhealth. He's ill; I suppose he was getting ill then. Instead of\nexplaining himself--he was--excited and--unwise. And now----\"\n\n\"Now I suppose he has--explained,\" said Mr. Brumley slowly and with\ninfinite distaste. \"Lady Harman, _what_ has he explained?\"\n\n\"It isn't so much that he has explained, Mr. Brumley,\" said Lady Harman,\n\"as that things have explained themselves.\"\n\n\"But how, Lady Harman? How?\"\n\n\"I mean about my being a mere girl, almost a child when I married him.\nNaturally he wanted to take charge of everything and leave nothing to\nme. And quite as naturally he didn't notice that now I am a woman, grown\nup altogether. And it's been necessary to do things. And naturally, Mr.\nBrumley, they shocked and upset him. But he sees now so clearly, he\nwrote to me, such a fair letter--an unusual letter--quite different from\nwhen he talks--it surprised me, telling me he wanted me to feel free,\nthat he meant to make me--to arrange things that is, so that I should\nfeel free and more able to go about as I pleased. It was a _generous_\nletter, Mr. Brumley. Generous about all sorts of affairs that there had\nbeen between us. He said things, quite kind things, not like the things\nhe has ever said before----\"\n\nShe stopped short and then began again.\n\n\"You know, Mr. Brumley, it's so hard to tell things without telling\nother things that somehow are difficult to tell. Yet if I don't tell you\nthem, you won't know them and then you won't be able to understand in\nthe least how things are with us.\"\n\nHer eyes appealed to him.\n\n\"Tell me,\" he said, \"whatever you think fit.\"\n\n\"When one has been afraid of anyone and felt they were ever so much\nstronger and cruel and hard than one is and one suddenly finds they\naren't. It alters everything.\"\n\nHe nodded, watching her.\n\nHer voice fell nearly to a whisper. \"Mr. Brumley,\" she said, \"when I\ncame back to him--you know he was in bed here--instead of scolding\nme--he _cried_. He cried like a vexed child. He put his face into the\npillow--just misery.... I'd never seen him cry--at least only once--long\nago....\"\n\nMr. Brumley looked at her flushed and tender face and it seemed to him\nthat indeed he could die for her quite easily.\n\n\"I saw how hard I had been,\" she said. \"In prison I'd thought of that,\nI'd thought women mustn't be hard, whatever happens to them. And when I\nsaw him like that I knew at once how true that was.... He begged me to\nbe a good wife to him. No!--he just said, 'Be a wife to me,' not even a\ngood wife--and then he cried....\"\n\nFor a moment or so Mr. Brumley didn't respond. \"I see,\" he said at last.\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And there were the children--such helpless little things. In the prison\nI worried about them. I thought of things for them. I've come to\nfeel--they are left too much to nurses and strangers.... And then you\nsee he has agreed to nearly everything I had wanted. It wasn't only the\npersonal things--I was anxious about those silly girls--the strikers. I\ndidn't want them to be badly treated. It distressed me to think of them.\nI don't think you know how it distressed me. And he--he gave way upon\nall that. He says I may talk to him about the business, about the way we\ndo our business--the kindness of it I mean. And this is why I am back\nhere. Where else _could_ I be?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Brumley still with the utmost reluctance. \"I see.\nOnly----\"\n\nHe paused downcast and she waited for him to speak.\n\n\"Only it isn't what I expected, Lady Harman. I didn't think that matters\ncould be settled by such arrangements. It's sane, I know, it's\ncomfortable and kindly. But I thought--Oh! I thought of different\nthings, quite different things from all this. I thought of you who are\nso beautiful caught in a loveless passionless world. I thought of the\nthings there might be for you, the beautiful and wonderful things of\nwhich you are deprived.... Never mind what I thought! Never mind! You've\nmade your choice. But I thought that you didn't love, that you couldn't\nlove--this man. It seemed to me that you felt too--that to live as you\nare doing--with him--was a profanity. Something--I'd give everything I\nhave, everything I am, to save you from. Because--because I care.... I\nmisunderstood you. I suppose you can--do what you are doing.\"\n\nHe jumped to his feet as he spoke and walked three paces away and turned\nto utter his last sentences. She too stood up.\n\n\"Mr. Brumley,\" she said weakly, \"I don't understand. What do you mean? I\nhave to do what I am doing. He--he is my husband.\"\n\nHe made a gesture of impatience. \"Do you understand nothing of _love_?\"\nhe cried.\n\nShe pressed her lips together and remained still and silent, dark\nagainst the casement window.\n\nThere came a sound of tapping from the room above. Three taps and again\nthree taps.\n\nLady Harman made a little gesture as though she would put this sound\naside.\n\n\"Love,\" she said at last. \"It comes to some people. It happens. It\nhappens to young people.... But when one is married----\"\n\nHer voice fell almost to a whisper. \"One must not think of it,\" she\nsaid. \"One must think of one's husband and one's duty. Life cannot begin\nagain, Mr. Brumley.\"\n\nThe taps were repeated, a little more urgently.\n\n\"That is my husband,\" she said.\n\nShe hesitated through a little pause. \"Mr. Brumley,\" she said, \"I want\nfriendship so badly, I want some one to be my friend. I don't want to\nthink of things--disturbing things--things I have lost--things that are\nspoilt. _That_--that which you spoke of; what has it to do with me?\"\n\nShe interrupted him as he was about to speak.\n\n\"Be my friend. Don't talk to me of impossible things. Love! Mr. Brumley,\nwhat has a married woman to do with love? I never think of it. I never\nread of it. I want to do my duty. I want to do my duty by him and by my\nchildren and by all the people I am bound to. I want to help people,\nweak people, people who suffer. I want to help him to help them. I want\nto stop being an idle, useless, spending woman....\"\n\nShe made a little gesture of appeal with her hands.\n\n\"Oh!\" he sighed, and then, \"You know if I can help you----Rather than\ndistress you----\"\n\nHer manner changed. It became confidential and urgent.\n\n\"Mr. Brumley,\" she said, \"I must go up to my husband. He will be\nimpatient. And when I tell him you are here he will want to see you....\nYou will come up and see him?\"\n\nMr. Brumley sought to convey the struggle within him by his pose.\n\n\"I will do what you wish, Lady Harman,\" he said, with an almost\ntheatrical sigh.\n\nHe closed the door after her and was alone in his former study once\nmore. He walked slowly to his old writing-desk and sat down in his\nfamiliar seat. Presently he heard her footfalls across the room above.\nMr. Brumley's mind under the stress of the unfamiliar and the unexpected\nwas now lapsing rapidly towards the theatrical. \"My _God_!\" said Mr.\nBrumley.\n\nHe addressed that friendly memorable room in tones that mingled\namazement and wrong. \"He is her husband!\" he said, and then: \"The power\nof words!\" ...\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a77\n\nIt seemed to Mr. Brumley's now entirely disordered mind that Sir Isaac,\npropped up with cushions upon a sofa in the upstairs sitting-room,\nwhite-faced, wary and very short of breath, was like Proprietorship\nenthroned. Everything about him referred deferentially to him. Even his\nwife dropped at once into the position of a beautiful satellite. His\nillness, he assured his visitor with a thin-lipped emphasis, was \"quite\ntemporary, quite the sort of thing that might happen to anyone.\" He had\nhad a queer little benumbing of one leg, \"just a trifle of nerve fag did\nit,\" and the slight asthma that came and went in his life had taken\nadvantage of his condition to come again with a little beyond its usual\naggressiveness. \"Elly is going to take me off to Marienbad next week or\nthe week after,\" he said. \"I shall have a cure and she'll have a treat,\nand we shall come back as fit as fiddles.\" The incidents of the past\nmonth were to be put on a facetious footing it appeared. \"It's a mercy\nthey didn't crop her hair,\" he said, apropos of nothing and with an air\nof dry humour. No further allusion was made to Lady Harman's\nincarceration.\n\nHe was dressed in a lama wool bedroom suit and his resting leg was\ncovered by a very splendid and beautiful fur rug. All Euphemia's best\nand gayest cushions sustained his back. The furniture had been\ncompletely rearranged for his comfort and convenience. Close to his hand\nwas a little table with carefully selected remedies and aids and helps\nand stimulants, and the latest and best of the light fiction of the day\nwas tossed about between the table, the couch and the floor. At the foot\nof the couch Euphemia's bedroom writing-table had been placed, and over\nthis there were scattered traces of the stenographer who had assisted\nhim to wipe off the day's correspondence. Three black cylinders and\nother appliances in the corner witnessed that his slight difficulty in\nbreathing could be relieved by oxygen, and his eyes were regaled by a\ngreat abundance of London flowers at every available point in the room.\nOf course there were grapes, fabulous looking grapes.\n\nEverything conspired to give Sir Isaac and his ownership the centre of\nthe picture. Mr. Brumley had been brought upstairs to him, and the tea\ntable, with scarcely a reference to anyone else, was arranged by Snagsby\nconveniently to his hand. And Sir Isaac himself had a confidence--the\nassurance of a man who has been shaken and has recovered. Whatever tears\nhe had ever shed had served their purpose and were forgotten. \"Elly\" was\nhis and the house was his and everything about him was his--he laid his\nhand upon her once when she came near him, his possessiveness was so\ngross--and the strained suspicion of his last meeting with Mr. Brumley\nwas replaced now by a sage and wizened triumph over anticipated and\narrested dangers.\n\nTheir party was joined by Sir Isaac's mother, and the sight of her\nsturdy, swarthy, and rather dignified presence flashed the thought into\nMr. Brumley's mind that Sir Isaac's father must have been a very blond\nand very nosey person indeed. She was homely and practical and\ncontributed very usefully to a conversation that remained a trifle\nfragmentary and faintly uncomfortable to the end.\n\nMr. Brumley avoided as much as he could looking at Lady Harman, because\nhe knew Sir Isaac was alert for that, but he was acutely aware of her\npresence dispensing the tea and moving about the room, being a good\nwife. It was his first impression of Lady Harman as a good wife and he\ndisliked the spectacle extremely. The conversation hovered chiefly about\nMarienbad, drifted away and came back again. Mrs. Harman made several\nconfidences that provoked the betrayal of a strain of irritability in\nSir Isaac's condition. \"We're all looking forward to this Marienbad\nexpedition,\" she said. \"I do hope it will turn out well. Neither of them\nhave ever been abroad before--and there's the difficulty of the\nlanguages.\"\n\n\"Ow,\" snarled Sir Isaac, with a glance at his mother that was almost\nvicious and a lapse into Cockney intonations and phrases that witnessed\nhow her presence recalled his youth, \"It'll _go_ all right, mother.\n_You_ needn't fret.\"\n\n\"Of course they'll have a courier to see to their things, and go train\nde luxe and all that,\" Mrs. Harman explained with a certain gusto. \"But\nstill it's an adventure, with him not well, and both as I say more like\nchildren than grown-up people.\"\n\nSir Isaac intervened with a crushing clumsiness to divert this strain of\nexplanation, with questions about the quality of the soil in the wood\nwhere the ground was to be cleared and levelled for his tennis lawns.\n\nMr. Brumley did his best to behave as a man of the world should. He made\nintelligent replies about the sand, he threw out obvious but serviceable\nadvice upon travel upon the continent of Europe, and he tried not to\nthink that this was the way of living into which the sweetest,\ntenderest, most beautiful woman in the world had been trapped. He\navoided looking at her until he felt it was becoming conspicuous, a\nnegative stare. Why had she come back again? Fragmentary phrases she had\nused downstairs came drifting through his mind. \"I never think of it. I\nnever read of it.\" And she so made for beautiful love and a beautiful\nlife! He recalled Lady Beach-Mandarin's absurdly apt, absurdly inept,\n\"like Godiva,\" and was suddenly impelled to raise the question of those\nstrikers.\n\n\"Your trouble with your waitresses is over, Sir Isaac?\"\n\nSir Isaac finished a cup of tea audibly and glanced at his wife. \"I\nnever meant to be hard on them,\" he said, putting down his cup. \"Never.\nThe trouble blew up suddenly. One can't be all over a big business\neverywhere all at once, more particularly if one is worried about other\nthings. As soon as I had time to look into it I put things right. There\nwas misunderstandings on both sides.\"\n\nHe glanced up again at Lady Harman. (She was standing behind Mr. Brumley\nso that he could not see her but--did their eyes meet?)\n\n\"As soon as we are back from Marienbad,\" Sir Isaac volunteered, \"Lady\nHarman and I are going into all that business thoroughly.\"\n\nMr. Brumley concealed his intense aversion for this association under a\ntone of intelligent interest. \"Into--I don't quite understand--what\nbusiness?\"\n\n\"Women employees in London--Hostels--all that kind of thing. Bit more\nsensible than suffragetting, eh, Elly?\"\n\n\"Very interesting,\" said Mr. Brumley with a hollow cordiality, \"very.\"\n\n\"Done on business lines, mind you,\" said Sir Isaac, looking suddenly\nvery sharp and keen, \"done on proper business lines, there's no end of a\nchange possible. And it's a perfectly legitimate outgrowth from such\npopular catering as ours. It interests me.\"\n\nHe made a little whistling noise with his teeth at the end of this\nspeech.\n\n\"I didn't know Lady Harman was disposed to take up such things,\" he\nsaid. \"Or I'd have gone into them before.\"\n\n\"He's going into them now,\" said Mrs. Harman, \"heart and soul. Why! we\nhave to take his temperature over it, to see he doesn't work himself up\ninto a fever.\" Her manner became reasonable and confidential. She spoke\nto Mr. Brumley as if her son was slightly deaf. \"It's better than his\nfretting,\" she said....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a78\n\nMr. Brumley returned to London in a state of extreme mental and\nemotional unrest. The sight of Lady Harman had restored all his passion\nfor her, the all too manifest fact that she was receding beyond his\nreach stirred him with unavailing impulses towards some impossible\nextremity of effort. She had filled his mind so much that he could not\nendure the thought of living without hope of her. But what hope was\nthere of her? And he was jealous, detestably jealous, so jealous that in\nthat direction he did not dare to let his mind go. He sawed at the bit\nand brought it back, or he would have had to writhe about the carriage.\nHis thoughts ran furiously all over the place to avoid that pit. And now\nhe found himself flashing at moments into wild and hopeless rebellion\nagainst the institution of marriage, of which he had hitherto sought\nalways to be the dignified and smiling champion against the innovator,\nthe over-critical and the young. He had never rebelled before. He was so\nastonished at the violence of his own objection that he lapsed from\ndefiance to an incredulous examination of his own novel attitude. \"It's\nnot _true_ marriage I object to,\" he told himself. \"It's this marriage\nlike a rat trap, alluring and scarcely unavoidable, so that in we all\ngo, and then with no escape--unless you tear yourself to rags. No\nescape....\"\n\nIt came to him that there was at least one way out for Lady Harman: _Sir\nIsaac might die!_ ...\n\nHe pulled himself up presently, astonished and dismayed at the\nactivities of his own imagination. Among other things he had wondered if\nby any chance Lady Harman had ever allowed her mind to travel in this\nsame post-mortem direction. At times surely the thing must have shone\nupon her as a possibility, a hope. From that he had branched off to a\nmore general speculation. How many people were there in the world, nice\npeople, kind people, moral and delicate-minded people, to whom the death\nof another person means release from that inflexible barrier--possibilities\nof secretly desired happiness, the realization of crushed and forbidden\ndreams? He had a vision of human society, like the vision of a night\nlandscape seen suddenly in a lightning flash, as of people caught by\ncouples in traps and quietly hoping for one another's deaths.\n\"Good Heavens!\" said Mr. Brumley, \"what are we coming to,\" and\ngot up in his railway compartment--he had it to himself--and walked up\nand down its narrow limits until a jolt over a point made him suddenly\nsit down again. \"Most marriages are happy,\" said Mr. Brumley, like a man\nwho has fallen into a river and scrambles back to safety. \"One mustn't\njudge by the exceptional cases....\n\n\"Though of course there are--a good many--exceptional cases.\" ...\n\nHe folded his arms, crossed his legs, frowned and reasoned with\nhimself,--resolved to dismiss post-mortem speculations--absolutely.\n\nHe was not going to quarrel with the institution of marriage. That was\ngoing too far. He had never been able to see the beginnings of reason in\nsexual anarchy, never. It is against the very order of things. Man is a\nmarrying animal just as much as he was a fire-making animal; he goes in\npairs like mantel ornaments; it is as natural for him to marry and to\nexact and keep good faith--if need be with a savage jealousy, as it is\nfor him to have lobes to his ears and hair under his armpits. These\nthings jar with the dream perhaps; the gods on painted ceilings have no\nsuch ties, acting beautifully by their very nature; and here on the\nfloor of the world one had them and one had to make the best of them....\nAre we making the best of them? Mr. Brumley was off again. That last\nthought opened the way to speculative wildernesses, and into these Mr.\nBrumley went wandering with a novel desperate enterprise to find a kind\nof marriage that would suit him.\n\nHe began to reform the marriage laws. He did his utmost not to think\nespecially of Lady Harman and himself while he was doing so. He would\njust take up the whole question and deal with it in a temperate\nreasonable way. It was so necessary to be reasonable and temperate in\nthese questions--and not to think of death as a solution. Marriages to\nbegin with were too easy to make and too difficult to break; countless\ngirls--Lady Harman was only a type--were married long before they could\nknow the beginnings of their own minds. We wanted to delay\nmarriage--until the middle twenties, say. Why not? Or if by the\ninfirmities of humanity one must have marriage before then, there ought\nto be some especial opportunity of rescinding it later. (Lady Harman\nought to have been able to rescind her marriage.) What ought to be the\nmarriageable age in a civilized community? When the mind was settled\ninto its general system of opinions Mr. Brumley thought, and then\nlapsed into a speculation whether the mind didn't keep changing and\ndeveloping all through life; Lady Harman's was certainly still doing\nso.... This pointed to logical consequences of an undesirable sort....\n\n(Some little mind-slide occurred just at this point and he found himself\nthinking that perhaps Sir Isaac might last for years and years, might\neven outlive a wife exhausted by nursing. And anyhow to wait for death!\nTo leave the thing one loved in the embrace of the moribund!)\n\nHe wrenched his thoughts back as quickly as possible to a disinterested\nreform of the marriage laws. What had he decided so far? Only for more\ndeliberation and a riper age in marrying. Surely that should appeal even\nto the most orthodox. But that alone would not eliminate mistakes and\ndeceptions altogether. (Sir Isaac's skin had a peculiar, unhealthy\nlook.) There ought in addition to be the widest facilities for divorce\npossible. Mr. Brumley tried to draw up a schedule in his head of the\ngrounds for divorce that a really civilized community would entertain.\nBut there are practical difficulties. Marriage is not simply a sexual\nunion, it is an economic one of a peculiarly inseparable sort,--and\nthere are the children. And jealousy! Of course so far as economics\nwent, a kind of marriage settlement might meet most of the difficulties,\nand as for the children, Mr. Brumley was no longer in that mood of\nenthusiastic devotion to children that had made the birth of George\nEdmund so tremendous an event. Children, alone, afforded no reason for\nindissoluble lifelong union. Face the thing frankly. How long was it\nabsolutely necessary for people to keep a home together for their\nchildren? The prosperous classes, the best classes in the community,\npacked the little creatures off to school at the age of nine or ten. One\nmight overdo--we were overdoing in our writing nowadays\nthis--philoprogenitive enthusiasm....\n\nHe found himself thinking of George Meredith's idea of Ten Year\nMarriages....\n\nHis mind recoiled to Sir Isaac's pillowed-up possession. What flimsy\nstuff all this talk of altered marriage was! These things did not even\ntouch the essentials of the matter. He thought of Sir Isaac's thin lips\nand wary knowing eyes. What possible divorce law could the wit of man\ndevise that would release a desired woman from that--grip? Marriage was\ncovetousness made law. As well ask such a man to sell all his goods and\ngive to the poor as expect the Sir Isaacs of this world to relax the\nmatrimonial subjugation of the wife. Our social order is built on\njealousy, sustained by jealousy, and those brave schemes we evolve in\nour studies for the release of women from ownership,--and for that\nmatter for the release of men too,--they will not stand the dusty heat\nof the market-place for a moment, they wilt under the first fierce\nbreath of reality. Marriage and property are the twin children of man's\nindividualistic nature; only on these terms can he be drawn into\nsocieties....\n\nMr. Brumley found his little scheme for novelties in marriage and\ndivorce lying dead and for the most part still-born in his mind; himself\nin despair. To set to work to alter marriage in any essential point was,\nhe realized, as if an ant should start to climb a thousand feet of\ncliff. This great institution rose upon his imagination like some\ninsurmountable sierra, blue and sombre, between himself and the life of\nLady Harman and all that he desired. There might be a certain amount of\ntinkering with matrimonial law in the next few years, of petty tinkering\nthat would abolish a few pretences and give ease to a few amiable\npeople, but if he were to come back to life a thousand years hence he\nfelt he would still find the ancient gigantic barrier, crossed perhaps\nby a dangerous road, pierced perhaps by a narrow tunnel or so, but in\nall its great essentials the same, between himself and Lady Harman. It\nwasn't that it was rational, it wasn't that it was justifiable, but it\nwas one with the blood in one's veins and the rain-cloud in the sky, a\nnecessity in the nature of present things. Before mankind emerged from\nthe valley of these restraints--if ever they did emerge--thousands of\ngenerations must follow one another, there must be tens of thousands of\nyears of struggle and thought and trial, in the teeth of prevalent habit\nand opinion--and primordial instincts. A new humanity....\n\nHis heart sank to hopelessness.\n\nMeanwhile? Meanwhile we had to live our lives.\n\nHe began to see a certain justification for the hidden cults that run\nbeneath the fair appearances of life, those social secrecies by which\npeople--how could one put it?--people who do not agree with established\ninstitutions, people, at any rate not merely egoistic and jealous as the\ncrowd is egoistic and jealous, hide and help one another to mitigate the\ninflexible austerities of the great unreason.\n\nYes, Mr. Brumley had got to a phrase of that quality for the\nundiscriminating imperatives of the fundamental social institution. You\nsee how a particular situation may undermine the assumptions of a mind\noriginally devoted to uncritical acceptances. He still insisted it was a\nnecessary great unreason, absolutely necessary--for the mass of people,\na part of them, a natural expression of them, but he could imagine the\npossibility--of 'understandings.' ... Mr. Brumley was very vague about\nthose understandings, those mysteries of the exalted that were to filch\nhappiness from the destroying grasp of the crude and jealous. He had to\nbe vague. For secret and noble are ideas like oil and water; you may\nfling them together with all the force of your will but in a little\nwhile they will separate again.\n\nFor a time this dream of an impossible secrecy was uppermost in Mr.\nBrumley's meditations. It came into his head with the effect of a\ndiscovery that always among the unclimbable barriers of this supreme\ninstitution there had been,--caves. He had been reading Anatole France\nrecently and the lady of _Le Lys Rouge_ came into his thoughts. There\nwas something in common between Lady Harman and the Countess Martin,\nthey were tall and dark and dignified, and Lady Harman was one of those\nrare women who could have carried the magnificent name of Th\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se. And\nthere in the setting of Paris and Florence was a whole microcosm of\nlove, real but illicit, carried out as it were secretly and tactfully,\nbeneath the great shadow of the cliff. But he found it difficult to\nimagine Lady Harman in that. Or Sir Isaac playing Count Martin's\npart....\n\nHow different were those Frenchwomen, with their afternoons vacant\nexcept for love, their detachment, their lovers, those secret,\nconvenient, romantically furnished flats, that compact explicit business\nof _l'amour_! He had indeed some moments of regret that Lady Harman\nwouldn't go into that picture. She was different--if only in her\nsimplicity. There was something about these others that put them whole\nworlds apart from her, who was held so tethered from all furtive\nadventure by her filmy tentacles of responsibility, her ties and strands\nof relationship, her essential delicacy. That momentary vision of Ellen\nas the Countess Martin broke up into absurdities directly he looked at\nit fully and steadfastly. From thinking of the two women as similar\ntypes he passed into thinking of them as opposites; Th\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se, hard,\nclear, sensuous, secretive, trained by a brilliant tradition in the\ntechnique of connubial betrayal, was the very antithesis of Ellen's\nvague but invincible veracity and openness. Not for nothing had Anatole\nFrance made his heroine the daughter of a grasping financial\nadventurer....\n\nOf course the cave is a part of the mountain....\n\nHis mind drifted away to still more general speculations, and always he\nwas trying not to see the figure of Sir Isaac, grimly and yet meanly\nresolute--in possession. Always too like some open-mouthed yokel at a\nfair who knows nothing of the insult chalked upon his back, he\ndisregarded how he himself coveted and desired and would if he could\nhave gripped. He forgot his own watchful attention to Euphemia in the\npast, nor did he think what he might have been if Lady Harman had been\nhis wife. It needed the chill veracities of the small hours to bring him\nto that. He thought now of crude egotism as having Sir Isaac's hands and\nSir Isaac's eyes and Sir Isaac's position. He forgot any egotism he\nhimself was betraying.\n\nAll the paths of enlightenment he thought of, led to Lady Harman.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a79\n\nThat evening George Edmund, who had come home with his mind aglitter\nwith cinematograph impressions, found his father a patient but\ninattentive listener. For indeed Mr. Brumley was not listening at all;\nhe was thinking and thinking. He made noises like \"Ah!\" and \"Um,\" at\nGeorge Edmund and patted the boy's shoulder kindly and repeated words\nunintelligently, such as, \"Red Indians, eh!\" or \"Came out of the water\nbackwards! My eye!\"\n\nSometimes he made what George Edmund regarded as quite footling\ncomments. Still George Edmund had to tell someone and there was no one\nelse to tell. So George Edmund went on talking and Mr. Brumley went on\nthinking.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a710\n\nMr Brumley could not sleep at all until it was nearly five. His\nintelligence seemed to be making up at last for years of speculative\nrestraint. In a world for the most part given up to slumber Mr. Brumley\nmay be imagined as clambering hand over fist in the silences, feverishly\nand wonderfully overtaking his age. In the morning he got up pallid and\nhe shaved badly, but he was a generation ahead of his own Euphemia\nseries, and the school of charm and quiet humour and of letting things\nslide with a kind of elegant donnishness, had lost him for ever....\n\nAnd among all sorts of things that had come to him in that vast gulf of\nnocturnal thinking was some vivid self-examination. At last he got to\nthat. He had been dragged down to very elemental things indeed by the\nmanifest completeness of Lady Harman's return to her husband. He had had\nat last to look at himself starkly for the male he was, to go beneath\nthe gentlemanly airs, the refined and elegant virilities of his habitual\nposes. Either this thing was unendurable--there were certainly moments\nwhen it came near to being unendurable--or it was not. On the whole and\nexcepting mere momentary paroxysms it was not, and so he had to\nrecognize and he did recognize with the greatest amazement that there\ncould be something else besides sexual attraction and manoeuvring and\npossession between a beautiful woman and a man like himself. He loved\nLady Harman, he loved her, he now began to realize just how much, and\nshe could defeat him and reject him as a conceivable lover, turn that\naside as a thing impossible, shame him as the romantic school would\ncount shame and still command him with her confident eyes and her\nfriendly extended hands. He admitted he suffered, let us rather say he\nclaimed to suffer the heated torments of a passionate nature, but he\nperceived like fresh air and sunrise coming by blind updrawn and opened\nwindow into a foetid chamber, that also he loved her with a clean and\nbodiless love, was anxious to help her, was anxious now--it was a new\nthing--to understand her, to reassure her, to give unrequited what once\nhe had sought rather to seem to give in view of an imagined exchange.\n\nHe perceived too in these still hours how little he had understood her\nhitherto. He had been blinded,--obsessed. He had been seeing her and\nhimself and the whole world far too much as a display of the eternal\ndualism of sex, the incessant pursuit. Now with his sexual imaginings\nnewly humbled and hopeless, with a realization of her own tremendous\nminimization of that fundamental of romance, he began to see all that\nthere was in her personality and their possible relations outside that.\nHe saw how gravely and deeply serious was her fine philanthropy, how\nhonest and simple and impersonal her desire for knowledge and\nunderstandings. There is the brain of her at least, he thought, far out\nof Sir Isaac's reach. She wasn't abased by her surrenders, their\nsimplicity exalted her, showed her innocent and himself a flushed and\ncongested soul. He perceived now with the astonishment of a man newly\nawakened just how the great obsession of sex had dominated him--for how\nmany years? Since his early undergraduate days. Had he anything to put\nbeside her own fine detachment? Had he ever since his manhood touched\nphilosophy, touched a social question, thought of anything human,\nthought of art, or literature or belief, without a glancing reference of\nthe whole question to the uses of this eternal hunt? During that time\nhad he ever talked to a girl or woman with an unembarrassed sincerity?\nHe stripped his pretences bare; the answer was no. His very refinements\nhad been no more than indicative fig-leaves. His conservatism and\nmorality had been a mere dalliance with interests that too brutal a\nsimplicity might have exhausted prematurely. And indeed hadn't the whole\nperiod of literature that had produced him been, in its straining purity\nand refinement, as it were one glowing, one illuminated fig-leaf, a vast\nconspiracy to keep certain matters always in mind by conspicuously\ncovering them away? But this wonderful woman--it seemed--she hadn't them\nin mind! She shamed him if only by her trustful unsuspiciousness of the\nancient selfish game of Him and Her that he had been so ardently\nplaying.... He idealized and worshipped this clean blindness. He abased\nhimself before it.\n\n\"No,\" cried Mr. Brumley suddenly in the silence of the night, \"I will\nrise again. I will rise again by love out of these morasses.... She\nshall be my goddess and by virtue of her I will end this incessant\nirrational craving for women.... I will be her friend and her faithful\nfriend.\"\n\nHe lay still for a time and then he said in a whisper very humbly: \"_God\nhelp me_.\"\n\nHe set himself in those still hours which are so endless and so\nprofitable to men in their middle years, to think how he might make\nhimself the perfect lover instead of a mere plotter for desire, and how\nhe might purge himself from covetousness and possessiveness and learn to\nserve.\n\nAnd if very speedily his initial sincerity was tinged again with egotism\nand if he drowsed at last into a portrait of himself as beautifully and\nadmirably self-sacrificial, you must not sneer too readily at him, for\nso God has made the soul of Mr. Brumley and otherwise it could not do.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE TENTH\n\nLADY HARMAN COMES OUT\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a71\n\nThe treaty between Lady Harman and her husband which was to be her Great\nCharter, the constitutional basis of her freedoms throughout the rest of\nher married life, had many practical defects. The chief of these was\nthat it was largely undocumented; it had been made piecemeal, in various\nways, at different times and for the most part indirectly through\ndiverse intermediaries. Charterson had introduced large vaguenesses by\nsimply displaying more of his teeth at crucial moments, Mrs. Harman had\nconveyed things by hugging and weeping that were afterwards discovered\nto be indistinct; Sir Isaac writing from a bed of sickness had\nfrequently been totally illegible. One cannot therefore detail the\nclauses of this agreement or give its provisions with any great\nprecision; one can simply intimate the kind of understanding that had\nhad an air of being arrived at. The working interpretations were still\nto come.\n\nBefore anything else it was manifestly conceded by Lady Harman that she\nwould not run away again, and still more manifest that she undertook to\nbreak no more windows or do anything that might lead to a second police\ncourt scandal. And she was to be a true and faithful wife and comfort,\nas a wife should be, to Sir Isaac. In return for that consideration and\nto ensure its continuance Sir Isaac came great distances from his former\nassumption of a matrimonial absolutism. She was to be granted all sorts\nof small autonomies,--the word autonomy was carefully avoided throughout\nbut its spirit was omnipresent.\n\nShe was in particular to have a banking account for her dress and\npersonal expenditure into which Sir Isaac would cause to be paid a\nhundred pounds monthly and it was to be private to herself alone until\nhe chose to go through the cashed cheques and counterfoils. She was to\nbe free to come and go as she saw fit, subject to a punctual appearance\nat meals, the comfort and dignity of Sir Isaac and such specific\nengagements as she might make with him. She might have her own friends,\nbut there the contract became a little misty; a time was to come when\nSir Isaac was to betray a conviction that the only proper friends that a\nwoman can have are women. There were also non-corroborated assurances as\nto the privacy of her correspondence. The second Rolls-Royce car was to\nbe entirely at her service, and Clarence was to be immediately\nsupplemented by a new and more deferential man, and as soon as possible\nassisted to another situation and replaced. She was to have a voice in\nthe further furnishing of Black Strand and in the arrangement of its\ngarden. She was to read what she chose and think what she liked within\nher head without too minute or suspicious an examination by Sir Isaac,\nand short of flat contradiction at his own table she was to be free to\nexpress her own opinions in any manner becoming a lady. But more\nparticularly if she found her ideas infringing upon the management or\ninfluence of the International Bread and Cake Stores, she was to convey\nher objections and ideas in the first instance privately and\nconfidentially to Sir Isaac.\n\nUpon this point he displayed a remarkable and creditable sensitiveness.\nHis pride in that organization was if possible greater than his original\npride in his wife, and probably nothing in all the jarring of their\nrelationship had hurt him more than her accessibility to hostile\ncriticism and the dinner-table conversation with Charterson and Blenker\nthat had betrayed this fact. He began to talk about it directly she\nreturned to him. His protestations and explanations were copious and\nheart-felt. It was perhaps the chief discovery made by Lady Harman at\nthis period of reconstruction that her husband's business side was not\nto be explained completely as a highly energetic and elaborate avarice.\nHe was no doubt acquisitive and retentive and mean-spirited, but these\nwere merely the ugly aspects of a disposition that involved many other\nfactors. He was also incurably a schemer. He liked to fit things\ntogether, to dove-tail arrangements, to devise economies, to spread\ningeniously into new fields, he had a love of organization and\ncontrivance as disinterested as an artist's love for the possibilities\nof his medium. He would rather have made a profit of ten per cent. out\nof a subtly planned shop than thirty by an unforeseen accident. He\nwouldn't have cheated to get money for the world. He knew he was better\nat figuring out expenditures and receipts than most people and he was as\ntouchy about his reputation for this kind of cleverness as any poet or\npainter for his fame. Now that he had awakened to the idea that his wife\nwas capable of looking into and possibly even understanding his\nbusiness, he was passionately anxious to show her just how wonderfully\nhe had done it all, and when he perceived she was in her large,\nunskilled, helpless way, intensely concerned for all the vast multitude\nof incompetent or partially competent young women who floundered about\nin badly paid employment in our great cities, he grasped at once at the\nopportunity of recovering her lost interest and respect by doing some\nbrilliant feats of contrivance in that direction. Why shouldn't he? He\nhad long observed with a certain envy the admirable advertisement such\nfirms as Lever and Cadbury and Burroughs & Wellcome gained from their\nostentatiously able and generous treatment of their workpeople, and it\nseemed to him conceivable that in the end it might not be at all\ndetrimental to his prosperity to put his hand to this long neglected\npiece of social work. The Babs Wheeler business had been a real injury\nin every way to the International Bread and Cake Stores and even if he\ndidn't ultimately go to all the lengths his wife seemed to contemplate,\nhe was resolved at any rate that an affair of that kind should not occur\nagain. The expedition to Marienbad took with it a secretary who was also\na stenographer. A particularly smart young inspector and Graper, the\nstaff manager, had brisk four-day holidays once or twice for\nconsultation purposes; Sir Isaac's rabbit-like architect was in\nattendance for a week and the Harmans returned to Putney with the first\nvivid greens of late March,--for the Putney Hill house was to be\nreopened and Black Strand reserved now for week-end and summer use--with\nplans already drawn out for four residential Hostels in London primarily\nfor the girl waitresses of the International Stores who might have no\nhomes or homes at an inconvenient distance, and, secondarily, if any\nvacant accommodation remained over, for any other employed young women\nof the same class....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a72\n\nLady Harman came back to England from the pine-woods and bright order\nand regimen and foreign novelty of their Bohemian Kur-Ort, in a state of\nrenewed perplexity. Already that undocumented Magna Charta was\nmanifestly not working upon the lines she had anticipated. The glosses\nSir Isaac put upon it were extensive and remarkable and invariably in\nthe direction of restricting her liberties and resuming controls she had\nsupposed abandoned.\n\nMarienbad had done wonders for him; his slight limp had disappeared, his\nnervous energy was all restored; except for a certain increase in his\nnatural irritability and occasional panting fits, he seemed as well as\nhe had ever been. At the end of their time at the Kur he was even going\nfor walks. Once he went halfway up the Podhorn on foot. And with every\nincrement in his strength his aggressiveness increased, his recognition\nof her new freedoms was less cordial and her sense of contrition and\nresponsibility diminished. Moreover, as the scheme of those Hostels,\nwhich had played so large a part in her conception of their\nreconciliation, grew more and more definite, she perceived more and more\nthat it was not certainly that fine and humanizing thing she had\npresumed it would be. She began to feel more and more that it might be\nmerely an extension of Harman methods to cheap boarding-houses for young\npeople. But faced with a mass of detailed concrete projects and invited\nto suggest modifications she was able to realize for the first time how\nvague, how ignorant and incompetent her wishes had been, how much she\nhad to understand and how much she had to discover before she could meet\nSir Isaac with his \"I'm doing it all for you, Elly. If you don't like\nit, you tell me what you don't like and I'll alter it. But just vague\ndoubting! One can't do anything with vague doubting.\"\n\nShe felt that once back in England out of this picturesque toylike\nGerman world she would be able to grasp realities again and deal with\nthese things. She wanted advice, she wanted to hear what people said of\nher ideas. She would also, she imagined, begin to avail herself of those\nconceded liberties which their isolation together abroad and her\nhusband's constant need of her presence had so far prevented her from\ntasting. She had an idea that Susan Burnet might prove suggestive about\nthe Hostels.\n\nAnd moreover, if now and then she could have a good talk with someone\nunderstanding and intelligent, someone she could trust, someone who\ncared enough for her to think with her and for her....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a73\n\nWe have traced thus far the emergence of Lady Harman from that state of\ndutiful subjection and social irresponsibility which was the lot of\nwoman in the past to that limited, ill-defined and quite unsecured\nfreedom which is her present condition. And now we have to give an\noutline of the ideas of herself and her uses and what she had to do,\nwhich were forming themselves in her mind. She had made a determination\nof herself, which carried her along the lines of her natural\npredisposition, to duty, to service. There she displayed that acceptance\nof responsibility which is so much more often a feminine than a\nmasculine habit of thinking. But she brought to the achievement of this\ndetermination a discriminating integrity of mind that is more frequently\nmasculine than feminine. She wanted to know clearly what she was\nundertaking and how far its consequences would reach and how it was\nrelated to other things.\n\nHer confused reading during the last few years and her own observation\nand such leakages of fact into her life as the talk of Susan Burnet, had\nall contributed to her realization that the world was full of needless\ndiscomfort and hardships and failure, due to great imperfectly\napprehended injustices and maladjustments in the social system, and\nrecently it had been borne in upon her, upon the barbed point of the\n_London Lion_ and the quick tongue of Susan, that if any particular\nclass of people was more answerable than any other for these evils, it\nwas the people of leisure and freedom like herself, who had time to\nthink, and the directing organizing people like her husband, who had\npower to change. She was called upon to do something, at times the call\nbecame urgent, and she could not feel any assurance which it was of the\nmany vague and conflicting suggestions that came drifting to her that\nshe had to do. Her idea of Hostels for the International waitresses had\nbeen wrung out of her prematurely during her earlier discussions with\nher husband. She did not feel that it was anything more than a partial\nremedy for a special evil. She wanted something more general than that,\nsomething comprehensive enough to answer completely so wide a question\nas \"What ought I to be doing with all my life?\" In the honest simplicity\nof her nature she wanted to find an answer to that. Out of the\nconfusion of voices about us she hoped to be able to disentangle\ndirections for her life. Already she had been reading voraciously: while\nshe was still at Marienbad she had written to Mr. Brumley and he had\nsent her books and papers, advanced and radical in many cases, that she\nmight know, \"What are people thinking?\"\n\nMany phrases from her earlier discussions with Sir Isaac stuck in her\nmind in a curiously stimulating way and came back to her as she read.\nShe recalled him, for instance, with his face white and his eyes red and\nhis flat hand sawing at her, saying: \"I dessay I'm all wrong, I dessay I\ndon't know anything about anything and all those chaps you read, Bernud\nShaw, and Gosworthy, and all the rest of them are wonderfully clever;\nbut you tell me, Elly, what they say we've got to do! You tell me that.\nYou go and ask some of those chaps just what they want a man like me to\ndo.... They'll ask me to endow a theatre or run a club for novelists or\nadvertise the lot of them in the windows of my International Stores or\nsomething. And that's about all it comes to. You go and see if I'm not\nright. They grumble and they grumble; I don't say there's not a lot to\ngrumble at, but give me something they'll back themselves for all\nthey're worth as good to get done.... That's where I don't agree with\nall these idees. They're Wind, Elly, Weak wind at that.\"\n\nIt is distressing to record how difficult it was for Lady Harman to form\neven the beginnings of a disproof of that. Her life through all this\nsecond phase of mitigated autonomy was an intermittent pilgrimage in\nsearch of that disproof. She could not believe that things as they were,\nthis mass of hardships, cruelties, insufficiencies and heartburnings\nwere the ultimate wisdom and possibility of human life, yet when she\nwent from them to the projects that would replace or change them she\nseemed to pass from things of overwhelming solidity to matters more thin\nand flimsy than the twittering of sparrows on the gutter. So soon as she\nreturned to London she started upon her search for a solution; she\nsupplemented Mr. Brumley's hunt for books with her own efforts, she went\nto meetings--sometimes Sir Isaac took her, once or twice she was\nescorted by Mr. Brumley, and presently her grave interest and her\npersonal charm had gathered about her a circle of companionable friends.\nShe tried to talk to people and made great efforts to hear people who\nseemed authoritative and wise and leaderlike, talking.\n\nThere were many interruptions to this research, but she persevered.\nQuite early she had an illness that ended in a miscarriage, an accident\nfor which she was by no means inconsolable, and before she had\ncompletely recovered from that Sir Isaac fell ill again, the first of a\nseries of relapses that necessitated further foreign travel--always in\nelaborately comfortable trains with maid, courier, valet, and secretary,\nto some warm and indolent southward place. And few people knew how\nuncertain her liberties were. Sir Isaac was the victim of an increasing\nirritability, at times he had irrational outbursts of distrust that\nwould culminate in passionate outbreaks and scenes that were truncated\nby an almost suffocating breathlessness. On several occasions he was on\nthe verge of quarrelling violently with her visitors, and he would\nsuddenly oblige her to break engagements, pour abuse upon her and bring\nmatters back to the very verge of her first revolt. And then he would\nbreak her down by pitiful appeals. The cylinders of oxygen would be\nresorted to, and he would emerge from the crisis, rather rueful, tamed\nand quiet for the time.\n\nHe was her chief disturbance. Her children were healthy children and\nfell in with the routines of governess and tutor that their wealth\nprovided. She saw them often, she noted their increasing resemblance to\ntheir father, she did her best to soften the natural secretiveness and\naggressiveness of their manners, she watched their teachers and\nintervened whenever the influences about them seemed to her to need\nintervention, she dressed them and gave them presents and tried to\nbelieve she loved them, and as Sir Isaac's illness increased she took a\nlarger and larger share in the direction of the household....\n\nThrough all these occupations and interruptions and immediacies she went\ntrying to comprehend and at times almost believing she comprehended\nlife, and then the whole spectacle of this modern world of which she was\na part would seem to break up again into a multitude of warring and\ndiscordant fragments having no conceivable common aim or solution.\nThose moments of unifying faith and confidence, that glowed so bravely\nand never endured, were at once tantalizing and sustaining. She could\nnever believe but that ultimately she would not grasp and\nhold--something....\n\nMany people met her and liked her and sought to know more of her; Lady\nBeach-Mandarin and Lady Viping were happy to be her social sponsors, the\nBlenkers and the Chartersons met her out and woke up cautiously to this\nnew possibility; her emergence was rapid in spite of the various delays\nand interruptions I have mentioned and she was soon in a position to\nrealize just how little one meets when one meets a number of people and\nhow little one hears when one has much conversation. Her mind was\npresently crowded with confused impressions of pleasant men evading her\nagreeably and making out of her gravities an opportunity for bright\nsayings, and of women being vaguely solemn and quite indefinite.\n\nShe went into the circle of movements, was tried over by Mrs. Hubert\nPlessington, she questioned this and that promoter of constructive\nschemes, and instead of mental meat she was asked to come upon\ncommittees and sounded for subscriptions. On several occasions, escorted\nby Mr. Brumley--some instinct made her conceal or minimize his share in\nthese expeditions to her husband--she went as inconspicuously as\npossible to the backs of public meetings in which she understood great\nquestions were being discussed or great changes inaugurated. Some\npublic figures she even followed up for a time, distrusting her first\nimpressions.\n\nShe became familiar with the manners and bearing of our platform class,\nwith the solemn dummy-like chairman or chairwoman, saying a few words,\nthe alert secretary or organizer, the prominent figures sitting with an\nair of grave responsibility, generously acting an intelligent attention\nto others until the moment came for them themselves to deliver. Then\nwith an ill-concealed relief some would come to the footlights, some\nleap up in their places with a tenoring eagerness, some would be\nfacetious and some speak with neuralgic effort, some were impertinent,\nsome propitiatory, some dull, but all were--disappointing,\ndisappointing. God was not in any of them. A platform is no setting for\nthe shy processes of an honest human mind,--we are all strained to\nartificiality in the excessive glare of attention that beats upon us\nthere. One does not exhibit opinions at a meeting, one acts them, the\nvery truth must rouge its cheeks and blacken its eyebrows to tell, and\nto Lady Harman it was the acting chiefly and the make-up that was\nvisible. They didn't grip her, they didn't lift her, they failed to\nconvince her even of their own belief in what they supported.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a74\n\nBut occasionally among the multitude of conversations that gave her\nnothing, there would come some talk that illuminated and for the time\nalmost reconciled her to the effort and the loss of time and distraction\nher social expeditions involved. One evening at one of Lady Tarvrille's\ncarelessly compiled parties she encountered Edgar Wilkins the novelist\nand got the most suggestive glimpses of his attitude towards himself and\ntowards the world of intellectual ferment to which he belonged. She had\nbeen taken down by an amiable but entirely uninteresting permanent\nofficial who when the time came turned his stereotyped talk over to the\nother side of him with a quiet mechanical indifference, and she was left\nfor a little while in silence until Wilkins had disengaged himself.\n\nHe was a flushed man with untidy hair, and he opened at once with an\nappeal to her sympathies.\n\n\"Oh! Bother!\" he said. \"I say,--I've eaten that mutton. I didn't notice.\nOne eats too much at these affairs. One doesn't notice at the time and\nthen afterwards one finds out.\"\n\nShe was a little surprised at his gambit and could think of nothing but\na kindly murmur.\n\n\"Detestable thing,\" he said; \"my body.\"\n\n\"But surely not,\" she tried and felt as she said it that was a trifle\nbold.\n\n\"You're all right,\" he said making her aware he saw her. \"But I've this\nthing that wheezes and fattens at the slightest excuse and--it encumbers\nme--bothers me to take exercise.... But I can hardly expect you to be\ninterested in my troubles, can I?\"\n\nHe made an all too manifest attempt to read her name on the slip of card\nthat lay before her among the flowers and as manifestly succeeded. \"We\npeople who write and paint and all that sort of thing are a breed of\ninsatiable egotists, Lady Harman. With the least excuse. Don't you think\nso?\"\n\n\"Not--not exceptionally,\" she said.\n\n\"Exceptionally,\" he insisted.\n\n\"It isn't my impression,\" she said. \"You're--franker.\"\n\n\"But someone was telling me--you've been taking impressions of us\nlately. I mean all of us people who go flapping ideas about in the air.\nSomebody--was it Lady Beach-Mandarin?--was saying you'd come out looking\nfor Intellectual Heroes--and found Bernard Shaw.... But what could you\nhave expected?\"\n\n\"I've been trying to find out and understand what people are thinking. I\nwant ideas.\"\n\n\"It's disheartening, isn't it?\"\n\n\"It's--perplexing sometimes.\"\n\n\"You go to meetings, and try to get to the bottom of Movements, and you\nwant to meet and know the people who write the wonderful things? Get at\nthe wonderful core of it?\"\n\n\"One feels there are things going on.\"\n\n\"Great illuminating things.\"\n\n\"Well--yes.\"\n\n\"And when you see those great Thinkers and Teachers and Guides and Brave\nSpirits and High Brows generally----\"\n\nHe laughed and stopped just in time on the very verge of taking\npheasant.\n\n\"Oh, take it away,\" he cried sharply.\n\n\"We've all been through that illusion, Lady Harman,\" he went on.\n\n\"But I don't like to think----Aren't Great Men after all--great?\"\n\n\"In their ways, in their places--Yes. But not if you go up to them and\nlook at them. Not at the dinner table, not in their beds.... What a time\nof disillusionment you must have had!\n\n\"You see, Lady Harman,\" he said, leaning back from his empty plate,\ninclining himself confidentially to her ear and speaking in a privy\ntone; \"it's in the very nature of things that we--if I may put myself\ninto the list--we ideologists, should be rather exceptionally loose and\nuntrustworthy and disappointing men. Rotters--to speak plain\ncontemporary English. If you come to think of it, it has to be so.\"\n\n\"But----\" she protested.\n\nHe met her eye firmly. \"It has to be.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"The very qualities that make literature entertaining, vigorous,\ninspiring, revealing, wonderful, beautiful and--all that sort of thing,\nmake its producers--if you will forgive the word again--rotters.\"\n\nShe smiled and lifted her eyebrows protestingly.\n\n\"Sensitive nervous tissue,\" he said with a finger up to emphasize his\nwords. \"Quick responsiveness to stimulus, a vivid, almost\nuncontrollable, expressiveness; that's what you want in your literary\nman.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lady Harman following cautiously. \"Yes, I suppose it is.\"\n\n\"Can you suppose for a moment that these things conduce to self-control,\nto reserve, to consistency, to any of the qualities of a trustworthy\nman?... Of course you can't. And so we _aren't_ trustworthy, we _aren't_\nconsistent. Our virtues are our vices.... _My_ life,\" said Mr. Wilkins\nstill more confidentially, \"won't bear examination. But that's by the\nway. It need not concern us now.\"\n\n\"But Mr. Brumley?\" she asked on the spur of the moment.\n\n\"I'm not talking of him,\" said Wilkins with careless cruelty. \"He's\nrestrained. I mean the really imaginative people, the people with\nvision, the people who let themselves go. You see now why they are\nrotten, why they must be rotten. (No! No! take it away. I'm talking.) I\nfeel so strongly about this, about the natural and necessary\ndisreputableness of everybody who produces reputable writing--and for\nthe matter of that, art generally--that I set my face steadily against\nall these attempts that keep on cropping up to make Figures of us. We\naren't Figures, Lady Harman; it isn't our line. Of all the detestable\naspects of the Victorian period surely that disposition to make Figures\nof its artists and literary men was the most detestable. Respectable\nFigures--Examples to the young. The suppressions, the coverings up that\nhad to go on, the white-washing of Dickens,--who was more than a bit of\na rip, you know, the concealment of Thackeray's mistresses. Did you know\nhe had mistresses? Oh rather! And so on. It's like that bust of Jove--or\nBacchus was it?--they pass off as Plato, who probably looked like any\nother literary Grub. That's why I won't have anything to do with these\nAcademic developments that my friend Brumley--Do you know him by the\nway?--goes in for. He's the third man down----You _do_ know him. And\nhe's giving up the Academic Committee, is he? I'm glad he's seen it at\nlast. What _is_ the good of trying to have an Academy and all that, and\nput us in uniform and make out we are Somebodies, and respectable enough\nto be shaken hands with by George and Mary, when as a matter of fact we\nare, by our very nature, a collection of miscellaneous scandals----We\n_must_ be. Bacon, Shakespear, Byron, Shelley--all the stars.... No,\nJohnson wasn't a star, he was a character by Boswell.... Oh! great\nthings come out of us, no doubt, our arts are the vehicles of wonder and\nhope, the world is dead without these things we produce, but that's no\nreason why--why the mushroom-bed should follow the mushrooms into the\nsoup, is it? Perfectly fair image. (No, take it away.)\"\n\nHe paused and then jumped in again as she was on the point of speaking.\n\n\"And you see even if our temperaments didn't lead inevitably to\nour--dipping rather, we should still have to--_dip_. Asking a writer or\na poet to be seemly and Academic and so on, is like asking an eminent\nsurgeon to be stringently decent. It's--you see, it's incompatible. Now\na king or a butler or a family solicitor--if you like.\"\n\nHe paused again.\n\nLady Harman had been following him with an attentive reluctance.\n\n\"But what are we to do,\" she asked, \"we people who are puzzled by life,\nwho want guidance and ideas and--help, if--if all the people we look to\nfor ideas are----\"\n\n\"Bad characters.\"\n\n\"Well,--it's your theory, you know--bad characters?\"\n\nWilkins answered with the air of one who carefully disentangles a\ncomplex but quite solvable problem. \"It doesn't follow,\" he said, \"that\nbecause a man is a bad character he's not to be trusted in matters where\ncharacter--as we commonly use the word--doesn't come in. These\nsensitives, these--would you mind if I were to call myself an \u00c3\u0086olian\nHarp?--these \u00c3\u0086olian Harps; they can't help responding to the winds of\nheaven. Well,--listen to them. Don't follow them, don't worship them,\ndon't even honour them, but listen to them. Don't let anyone stop them\nfrom saying and painting and writing and singing what they want to.\nFreedom, canvas and attention, those are the proper honours for the\nartist, the poet and the philosopher. Listen to the noise they make,\nwatch the stuff they produce, and presently you will find certain\nthings among the multitude of things that are said and shown and put out\nand published, something--light in _your_ darkness--a writer for you,\nsomething for you. Nobody can have a greater contempt for artists and\nwriters and poets and philosophers than I, oh! a squalid crew they are,\nmean, jealous, pugnacious, disgraceful in love, _disgraceful_--but out\nof it all comes the greatest serenest thing, the mind of the world,\nLiterature. Nasty little midges, yes,--but fireflies--carrying light for\nthe darkness.\"\n\nHis face was suddenly lit by enthusiasm and she wondered that she could\nhave thought it rather heavy and commonplace. He stopped abruptly and\nglanced beyond her at her other neighbour who seemed on the verge of\nturning to them again. \"If I go on,\" he said with a voice suddenly\ndropped, \"I shall talk loud.\"\n\n\"You know,\" said Lady Harman, in a halty undertone, \"you--you are too\nhard upon--upon clever people, but it is true. I mean it is true in a\nway....\"\n\n\"Go on, I understand exactly what you are saying.\"\n\n\"I mean, there _are_ ideas. It's just that, that is so--so----I mean\nthey seem never to be just there and always to be present.\"\n\n\"Like God. Never in the flesh--now. A spirit everywhere. You think\nexactly as I do, Lady Harman. It is just that. This is a great time, so\ngreat that there is no chance for great men. Every chance for great\nwork. And we're doing it. There is a wind--blowing out of heaven. And\nwhen beautiful people like yourself come into things----\"\n\n\"I try to understand,\" she said. \"I want to understand. I want--I want\nnot to miss life.\"\n\nHe was on the verge of saying something further and then his eyes\nwandered down the table and he stopped short.\n\nHe ended his talk as he had begun it with \"Bother! Lady Tarvrille, Lady\nHarman, is trying to catch your eye.\"\n\nLady Harman turned her face to her hostess and answered her smile.\nWilkins caught at his chair and stood up.\n\n\"It would have been jolly to have talked some more,\" he said.\n\n\"I hope we shall.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Wilkins, with a sudden hardness in his eyes and she was\nswept away from him.\n\nShe found no chance of talking to him upstairs, Sir Isaac came for her\nearly; but she went in hope of another meeting.\n\nIt did not come. For a time that expectation gave dinners and luncheon\nparties a quite appreciable attraction. Then she told Agatha Alimony.\n\"I've never met him but that once,\" she said.\n\n\"One doesn't meet him now,\" said Agatha, deeply.\n\n\"But why?\"\n\nDeep significance came into Miss Alimony's eyes. \"My dear,\" she\nwhispered, and glanced about them. \"Don't you _know_?\"\n\nLady Harman was a radiant innocence.\n\nAnd then Miss Alimony began in impressive undertones, with awful\nomissions like pits of darkness and with such richly embroidered details\nas serious spinsters enjoy, adding, indeed, two quite new things that\ncame to her mind as the tale unfolded, and, naming no names and giving\nno chances of verification or reply, handed on the fearful and at that\ntime extremely popular story of the awful wickedness of Wilkins the\nauthor.\n\nUpon reflection Lady Harman perceived that this explained all sorts of\nthings in their conversation and particularly the flash of hardness at\nthe end.\n\nEven then, things must have been hanging over him....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a75\n\nAnd while Lady Harman was making these meritorious and industrious\nattempts to grasp the significance of life and to get some clear idea of\nher social duty, the developments of those Hostels she had started--she\nnow felt so prematurely--was going on. There were times when she tried\nnot to think of them, turned her back on them, fled from them, and times\nwhen they and what she ought to do about them and what they ought to be\nand what they ought not to be, filled her mind to the exclusion of every\nother topic. Rigorously and persistently Sir Isaac insisted they were\nhers, asked her counsel, demanded her appreciation, presented as it were\nhis recurring bill for them.\n\nFive of them were being built, not four but five. There was to be one,\nthe largest, in a conspicuous position in Bloomsbury near the British\nMuseum, one in a conspicuous position looking out upon Parliament Hill,\none conspicuously placed upon the Waterloo Road near St. George's\nCircus, one at Sydenham, and one in the Kensington Road which was\ndesigned to catch the eye of people going to and fro to the various\nexhibitions at Olympia.\n\nIn Sir Isaac's study at Putney there was a huge and rather\nsplendid-looking morocco portfolio on a stand, and this portfolio bore\nin excellent gold lettering the words, International Bread and Cake\nHostels. It was her husband's peculiar pleasure after dinner to take her\nto turn over this with him; he would sit pencil in hand, while she,\npoised at his request upon the arm of his chair, would endorse a\nmultitude of admirable modifications and suggestions. These hostels were\nto be done--indeed they were being done--by Sir Isaac's tame architect,\nand the interlacing yellow and mauve tiles, and the Doulton ware\nmouldings that were already familiar to the public as the uniform of the\nStores, were to be used upon the fa\u00c3\u00a7ades of the new institutions. They\nwere to be boldly labelled\n\nINTERNATIONAL HOSTELS\n\nright across the front.\n\nThe plans revealed in every case a site depth as great as the frontage,\nand the utmost ingenuity had been used to utilize as much space as\npossible.\n\n\"Every room we get in,\" said Sir Isaac, \"adds one to the denominator in\nthe cost;\" and carried his wife back to her schooldays. At last she had\nfound sense in fractions. There was to be a series of convenient and\nspacious rooms on the ground floor, a refectory, which might be cleared\nand used for meetings--\"dances,\" said Lady Harman. \"Hardly the sort of\nthing we want 'em to get up to,\" said Sir Isaac--various offices, the\nmatron's apartments--\"We ought to begin thinking about matrons,\" said\nSir Isaac;--a bureau, a reading-room and a library--\"We can pick good,\nserious stuff for them,\" said Sir Isaac, \"instead of their filling their\nheads with trash\"--one or two workrooms with tables for cutting out and\nsewing; this last was an idea of Susan Burnet's. Upstairs there was to\nbe a beehive of bedrooms, floor above floor, and each floor as low as\nthe building regulations permitted. There were to be long dormitories\nwith cubicles at three-and-sixpence a week--make your own beds--and\nseparate rooms at prices ranging from four-and-sixpence to\nseven-and-sixpence. Every three cubicles and every bedroom had lavatory\nbasins with hot and cold water; there were pull-out drawers under the\nbeds and a built-in chest of drawers, a hanging cupboard, a\nlooking-glass and a radiator in each cubicle, and each floor had a\nbox-room. It was ship-shape.\n\n\"A girl can get this cubicle for three-and-six a week,\" said Sir Isaac,\ntapping the drawing before him with his pencil. \"She can get her\nbreakfast with a bit of bacon or a sausage for two shillings a week,\nand she can get her high tea, with cold meat, good potted salmon, shrimp\npaste, jam and cetera, for three-and-six a week. Say her bus fares and\nlunch out mean another four shillings. That means she can get along on\nabout twelve-and-six a week, comfortable, read the papers, have a book\nout of the library.... There's nothing like it to be got now for twice\nthe money. The sort of thing they have now is one room, dingy, badly\nfitted, extra for coals.\n\n\"That's the answer to your problem, Elly,\" he said. \"There we are. Every\ngirl who doesn't live at home can live here--with a matron to keep her\neye on her.... And properly run, Elly, properly run the thing's going to\npay two or three per cent,--let alone the advertisement for the Stores.\n\n\"We can easily make these Hostels obligatory on all our girls who don't\nlive at their own homes,\" he said. \"That ought to keep them off the\nstreets, if anything can. I don't see how even Miss Babs Wheeler can\nhave the face to strike against that.\n\n\"And then we can arrange with some of the big firms, drapers' shops and\nall that sort of thing near each hostel, to take over most of our other\ncubicle space. A lot of them--overflow.\n\n\"Of course we'll have to make sure the girls get in at night.\" He\nreached out for a ground floor plan of the Bloomsbury establishment\nwhich was to be the first built. \"If,\" he said, \"we were to have a sort\nof porter's lodge with a book--and make 'em ring a bell after eleven\nsay--just here....\"\n\nHe took out a silver pencil case and got to work.\n\nLady Harman's expression as she leant over him became thoughtful.\n\nThere were points about this project that gave her the greatest\nmisgivings; that matron, keeping her eye on the girls, that carefully\nselected library, the porter's bell, these casual allusions to\n\"discipline\" that set her thinking of scraps of the Babs Wheeler\ncontroversy. There was a regularity, an austerity about this project\nthat chilled her, she hardly knew why. Her own vague intentions had been\nan amiable, hospitable, agreeably cheap establishment to which the\nhomeless feminine employees in London could resort freely and\ncheerfully, and it was only very slowly that she perceived that her\nhusband was by no means convinced of the spontaneity of their coming. He\nseemed always glancing at methods for compelling them to come in and\noppressions when that compulsion had succeeded. There had already\nhovered over several of these anticipatory evenings, his very manifest\nintention to have very carefully planned \"Rules.\" She felt there lay\nahead of them much possibility for divergence of opinion about these\n\"Rules.\" She foresaw a certain narrowness and hardness. She herself had\nmade her fight against the characteristics of Sir Isaac and--perhaps she\nwas lacking in that aristocratic feeling which comes so naturally to\nmost successful middle-class people in England--she could not believe\nthat what she had found bad and suffocating for herself could be\nagreeable and helpful for her poorer sisters.\n\nIt occurred to her to try the effect of the scheme upon Susan Burnet.\nSusan had such a knack of seeing things from unexpected angles. She\ncontrived certain operations upon the study blinds, and then broached\nthe business to Susan casually in the course of an enquiry into the\nwelfare of the Burnet family.\n\nSusan was evidently prejudiced against the idea.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Susan after various explanations and exhibitions, \"but\nwhere's the home in it?\"\n\n\"The whole thing is a home.\"\n\n\"Barracks _I_ call it,\" said Susan. \"Nobody ever felt at home in a room\ncoloured up like that--and no curtains, nor vallances, nor toilet\ncovers, nor anywhere where a girl can hang a photograph or anything.\nWhat girl's going to feel at home in a strange place like that?\"\n\n\"They ought to be able to hang up photographs,\" said Lady Harman, making\na mental note of it.\n\n\"And of course there'll be all sorts of Rules.\"\n\n\"_Some_ rules.\"\n\n\"Homes, real homes don't have Rules. And I daresay--Fines.\"\n\n\"No, there shan't be any Fines,\" said Lady Harman quickly. \"I'll see to\nthat.\"\n\n\"You got to back up rules somehow--once you got 'em,\" said Susan. \"And\nwhen you get a crowd, and no father and mother, and no proper family\nfeeling, I suppose there's got to be Rules.\"\n\nLady Harman pointed out various advantages of the project.\n\n\"I'm not saying it isn't cheap and healthy and social,\" said Susan, \"and\nif it isn't too strict I expect you'll get plenty of girls to come to\nit, but at the best it's an Institution, Lady Harman. It's going to be\nan Institution. That's what it's going to be.\"\n\nShe held the front elevation of the Bloomsbury Hostel in her hand and\nreflected.\n\n\"Of course for my part, I'd rather lodge with nice struggling believing\nChristian people anywhere than go into a place like that. It's the\nfeeling of freedom, of being yourself and on your own. Even if the water\nwasn't laid on and I had to fetch it myself.... If girls were paid\nproperly there wouldn't be any need of such places, none at all. It's\nthe poverty makes 'em what they are.... And after all, somebody's got to\nlose the lodgers if this place gets them. Suppose this sort of thing\ngrows up all over the place, it'll just be the story of the little\nbakers and little grocers and all those people over again. Why in London\nthere are thousands of people just keep a home together by letting two\nor three rooms or boarding someone--and it stands to reason, they'll\nhave to take less or lose the lodgers if this kind of thing's going to\nbe done. Nobody isn't going to build a Hostel for them.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Lady Harman, \"I never thought of them.\"\n\n\"Lots of 'em haven't anything in the world but their bits of furniture\nand their lease and there they are stuck and tied. There's Aunt Hannah,\nFather's sister, she's like that. Sleeps in the basement and works and\nslaves, and often I've had to lend her ten shillings to pay the rent\nwith, through her not being full. This sort of place isn't going to do\nmuch good to her.\"\n\nLady Harman surveyed the plan rather blankly. \"I suppose it isn't.\"\n\n\"And then if you manage this sort of place easy and attractive, it's\ngoing to draw girls away from their homes. There's girls like Alice\nwho'd do anything to get a bit of extra money to put on their backs and\nseem to think of nothing but chattering and laughing and going about.\nSuch a place like this would be fine fun for Alice; in when she liked\nand out when she liked, and none of us to ask her questions. She'd be\njust the sort to go, and mother, who's had the upbringing of her, how's\nshe to make up for Alice's ten shillings what she pays in every week?\nThere's lots like Alice. She's not bad isn't Alice, she's a good girl\nand a good-hearted girl; I will say that for her, but she's shallow, say\nwhat you like she's shallow, she's got no thought and she's wild for\npleasure, and sometimes it seems to me that that's as bad as being bad\nfor all the good it does to anyone else in the world, and so I tell her.\nBut of course she hasn't seen things as I've seen them and doesn't feel\nas I do about all these things....\"\n\nThus Susan.\n\nHer discourse so puzzled Lady Harman that she bethought herself of Mr.\nBrumley and called in his only too readily accorded advice. She asked\nhim to tea on a day when she knew unofficially that Sir Isaac would be\naway, she showed him the plans and sketched their probable development.\nThen with that charming confidence of hers in his knowledge and ability\nshe put her doubts and fears before him. What did he really think of\nthese places? What did he think of Susan Burnet's idea of ruined\nlodging-house keepers? \"I used to think our stores were good things,\"\nshe said. \"Is this likely to be a good thing at all?\"\n\nMr. Brumley said \"Um\" a great number of times and realized that he was a\nhumbug. He fenced with her and affected sagacity for a time and suddenly\nhe threw down his defences and confessed he knew as little of the\nbusiness as she did. \"But I see it is a complex question and--it's an\ninteresting one too. May I enquire into it for you? I think I might be\nable to hunt up a few particulars....\"\n\nHe went away in a glow of resolution.\n\nGeorgina was about the only intimate who regarded the new development\nwithout misgiving.\n\n\"You think you're going to do all sorts of things with these Hostels,\nElla,\" she said, \"but as a matter of fact they're bound to become just\nexactly what we've always wanted.\"\n\n\"And what may that be?\" asked Mrs. Sawbridge over her macram\u00c3\u00a9 work.\n\n\"Strongholds for a garrison of suffragettes,\" said Georgina with the\nlight of the Great Insane Movement in her eyes and a ringing note in\nher voice. \"Fort Chabrols for women.\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a76\n\nFor some months in a negative and occasionally almost negligent fashion\nMr. Brumley had been living up to his impassioned resolve to be an\nunselfish lover of Lady Harman. He had been rather at loose ends\nintellectually, deprived of his old assumptions and habitual attitudes\nand rather chaotic in the matter of his new convictions. He had given\nmost of his productive hours to the writing of a novel which was to be\nan entire departure from the Euphemia tradition. The more he got on with\nthis, the more clearly he realized that it was essentially\ninsignificant. When he re-read what he had written he was surprised by\ncrudities where he had intended sincerities and rhetoric where the\nscheme had demanded passion. What was the matter with him? He was\nstirred that Lady Harman should send for him, and his inability to deal\nwith her perplexities deepened his realization of the ignorance and\nsuperficiality he had so long masked even from himself beneath the\ntricks and pretensions of a gay scepticism. He went away fully resolved\nto grapple with the entire Hostel question, and he put the patched and\ntortured manuscript of the new novel aside with a certain satisfaction\nto do this.\n\nThe more he reflected upon the nature of this study he proposed for\nhimself the more it attracted him. It was some such reality as this he\nhad been wanting. He could presently doubt whether he would ever go back\nto his novel-writing again, or at least to the sort of novel-writing he\nhad been doing hitherto. To invent stories to save middle-aged\nprosperous middle-class people from the distresses of thinking, is\nsurely no work for a self-respecting man. Stevenson in the very deeps of\nthat dishonourable traffic had realized as much and likened himself to a\n_fille de joie_, and Haggard, of the same school and period, had\nabandoned blood and thunder at the climax of his success for the honest\nstudy of agricultural conditions. The newer successes were turning out\nwork, less and less conventional and agreeable and more and more\nstiffened with facts and sincerities.... He would show Lady Harman that\na certain debonair quality he had always affected, wasn't incompatible\nwith a powerful grasp of general conditions.... And she wanted this\ndone. Suppose he did it in a way that made him necessary to her. Suppose\nhe did it very well.\n\nHe set to work, and understanding as you do a certain quality of the\nchameleon in Mr. Brumley's moral nature, you will understand that he\nworked through a considerable variety of moods. Sometimes he worked with\ndisinterested passion and sometimes he was greatly sustained by this\nthought that here was something that would weave him in with the\ngravities of her life and give him perhaps a new inlet to intimacy. And\npresently a third thing came to his help, and that was the discovery\nthat the questions arising out of this attempt to realize the\nimportance of those Hostels, were in themselves very fascinating\nquestions for an intelligent person.\n\nBecause before you have done with the business of the modern employ\u00c3\u00a9,\nyou must, if you are an intelligent person, have taken a view of the\nwhole vast process of social reorganization that began with the\ndevelopment of factory labour and big towns, and which is even now\nscarcely advanced enough for us to see its general trend. For a time Mr.\nBrumley did not realize the magnitude of the thing he was looking at;\nwhen he did, theories sprouted in his mind like mushrooms and he babbled\nwith mental excitement. He came in a state of the utmost lucidity to\nexplain his theories to Lady Harman, and they struck that lady at the\ntime as being the most illuminating suggestions she had ever\nencountered. They threw an appearance of order, of process, over a world\nof trade and employment and competition that had hitherto seemed too\ncomplex and mysterious for any understanding.\n\n\"You see,\" said Mr. Brumley--they had met that day in Kensington Gardens\nand they were sitting side by side upon green chairs near the frozen\nwritings of Physical Energy--\"You see, if I may lecture a little,\nputting the thing as simply as possible, the world has been filling up\nnew spaces ever since the discovery of America; all the period from then\nto about 1870, let us say, was a period of rapid increase of population\nin response to new opportunities of living and new fulnesses of life in\nevery direction. During that time, four hundred years of it roughly,\nthere was a huge development of family life; to marry and rear a quite\nconsiderable family became the chief business of everybody, celibacy\ngrew rare, monasteries and nunneries which had abounded vanished like\nthings dissolving in a flood and even the priests became Protestant\nagainst celibacy and took unto themselves wives and had huge families.\nThe natural checks upon increase, famine and pestilence, were lifted by\nmore systematized communication and by scientific discovery; and\naltogether and as a consequence the world now has probably three or four\ntimes the human population it ever carried before. Everywhere in that\nperiod the family prevailed again, the prospering multiplying household;\nit was a return to the family, to the reproductive social grouping of\nearly barbaric life, and naturally all the thought of the modern world\nwhich has emerged since the fifteenth century falls into this form. So I\nsee it, Lady Harman. The generation of our grandfathers in the opening\nnineteenth century had two shaping ideas, two forms of thought, the\nfamily and progress, not realizing that that very progress which had\nsuddenly reopened the doors of opportunity for the family that had\nrevived the ancient injunction to increase and multiply and replenish\nthe earth, might presently close that door again and declare the world\nwas filled. But that is what is happening now. The doors close. That\nimmense swarming and multiplying of little people is over, and the\nforces of social organization have been coming into play now, more and\nmore for a century and a half, to produce new wholesale ways of doing\nthings, new great organizations, organizations that invade the\nautonomous family more and more, and are perhaps destined ultimately to\ndestroy it altogether and supersede it. At least it is so I make my\nreading of history in these matters.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lady Harman, with knitted brows, \"Yes,\" and wondered\nprivately whether it would be possible to get from that opening to the\nmatter of her Hostels before it was time for her to return for Sir\nIsaac's tea.\n\nMr. Brumley continued to talk with his eyes fixed as it were upon his\nthoughts. \"These things, Lady Harman, go on at different paces in\ndifferent regions. I will not trouble you with a discussion of that, or\nof emigration, of any of the details of the vast proliferation that\npreceded the present phase. Suffice it, that now all the tendency is\nback towards restraints upon increase, to an increasing celibacy, to a\nfall in the birth-rate and in the average size of families, to--to a\nrelease of women from an entire devotion to a numerous offspring, and so\nat last to the supersession of those little family units that for four\ncenturies have made up the substance of social life and determined\nnearly all our moral and sentimental attitudes. The autonomy of the\nfamily is being steadily destroyed, and it is being replaced by the\nautonomy of the individual in relation to some syndicated economic\neffort.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Lady Harman slowly, arresting him by a gesture, \"if you\ncould make that about autonomy a little clearer....\"\n\nMr. Brumley did. He went on to point out with the lucidity of a\nUniversity Extension lecturer what he meant by these singular phrases.\nShe listened intelligently but with effort. He was much too intent upon\ngetting the thing expressed to his own satisfaction to notice any\nabsurdity in his preoccupation with these theories about the population\nof the world in the face of her immediate practical difficulties. He\ndeclared that the onset of this new phase in human life, the modern\nphase, wherein there was apparently to be no more \"proliferating,\" but\ninstead a settling down of population towards a stable equilibrium,\nbecame apparent first with the expropriation of the English peasantry\nand the birth of the factory system and machine production. \"Since that\ntime one can trace a steady substitution of wholesale and collective\nmethods for household and family methods. It has gone far with us now.\nInstead of the woman drawing water from a well, the pipes and taps of\nthe water company. Instead of the home-made rushlight, the electric\nlamp. Instead of home-spun, ready-made clothes. Instead of home-brewed,\nthe brewer's cask. Instead of home-baked, first the little baker and\nthen, clean and punctual, the International Bread and Cake Stores.\nInstead of the child learning at its mother's knee, the compulsory\nelementary school. Flats take the place of separate houses. Instead of\nthe little holding, the big farm, and instead of the children working\nat home, the factory. Everywhere synthesis. Everywhere the little\nindependent proprietor gives place to the company and the company to the\ntrust. You follow all this, Lady Harman?\"\n\n\"Go on,\" she said, encouraged by that transitory glimpse of the Stores\nin his discourse.\n\n\"Now London--and England generally--had its period of expansion and got\non to the beginnings at least of this period of synthesis that is\nfollowing it, sooner than any other country in the world; and because it\nwas the first to reach the new stage it developed the characteristics of\nthe new stage with a stronger flavour of the old than did such later\ngrowths of civilization as New York or Bombay or Berlin. That is why\nLondon and our British big cities generally are congestions of little\nhouses, little homes, while the newer great cities run to apartments and\nflats. We hadn't grasped the logical consequences of what we were in for\nso completely as the people abroad did who caught it later, and that is\nwhy, as we began to develop our new floating population of mainly\ncelibate employees and childless people, they had mostly to go into\nlodgings, they went into the homes that were intended for families as\naccessories to the family, and they were able to go in because the\nfamilies were no longer so numerous as they used to be. London is still\nlargely a city of landladies and lodgings, and in no other part of the\nworld is there so big a population of lodgers. And this business of your\nHostels is nothing more nor less than the beginning of the end of that.\nJust as the great refreshment caterers have mopped up the ancient\nmultitude of coffee-houses and squalid little special feeding\narrangements of the days of Tittlebat Titmouse and Dick Swiveller, so\nnow your Hostels are going to mop up the lodging-house system of London.\nOf course there are other and kindred movements. Naturally. The\nY.W.C.A., the Y.M.C.A., the London Girls Club Union and so forth are all\ndoing kindred work.\"\n\n\"But what, Mr. Brumley, what is to become of the landladies?\" asked Lady\nHarman.\n\nMr. Brumley was checked in mid theory.\n\n\"I hadn't thought of the landladies,\" he said, after a short pause.\n\n\"They worry me,\" said Lady Harman.\n\n\"Um,\" said Mr. Brumley, thrown out.\n\n\"Do you know the other day I went into Chelsea, where there are whole\nstreets of lodgings, and--I suppose it was wrong of me, but I went and\npretended to be looking for rooms for a girl clerk I knew, and I\nsaw--Oh! no end of rooms. And such poor old women, such dingy,\nworked-out, broken old women, with a kind of fearful sharpness, so\neager, so dreadfully eager to get that girl clerk who didn't exist....\"\n\nShe looked at him with an expression of pained enquiry.\n\n\"That,\" said Mr. Brumley, \"that I think is a question, so to speak, for\nthe social ambulance. If perhaps I might go on----That particular\ndifficulty we might consider later. I think I was talking of the general\nsynthesis.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lady Harman. \"And what is it exactly that is to take the\nplace of these isolated little homes and these dreary little lodgings?\nHere are we, my husband and I, rushing in with this new thing, just as\nhe rushed in with his stores thirty years ago and overset little bakers\nand confectioners and refreshment dealers by the hundred. Some of\nthem--poor dears--they----I don't like to think. And it wasn't a good\nthing he made after all,--only a hard sort of thing. He made all those\nshops of his--with the girls who strike and say they are sweated and\ndriven.... And now here we are making a kind of barrack place for people\nto live in!\"\n\nShe expressed the rest of her ideas with a gesture of the hands.\n\n\"I admit the process has its dangers,\" said Mr. Brumley. \"It's like the\nsupersession of the small holdings by the _latifundia_ in Italy. But\nthat's just where our great opportunity comes in. These synthetic phases\nhave occurred before in the world's history and their history is a\nhistory of lost opportunities.... But need ours be?\"\n\nShe had a feeling as though something had slipped through her fingers.\n\n\"I feel,\" she said, \"that it is more important to me than anything else\nin life, that these Hostels, anyhow, which are springing so rapidly from\na chance suggestion of mine, shouldn't be lost opportunities.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Mr. Brumley, with the gesture of one who recovers a\nthread. \"That is just what I am driving at.\"\n\nThe fingers of his extended hand felt in the warm afternoon air for a\nmoment, and then he said \"Ah!\" in a tone of recovery while she waited\nrespectfully for the resumed thread.\n\n\"You see,\" he said, \"I regard this process of synthesis, this\nsubstitution of wholesale and collective methods for homely and\nindividual ones as, under existing conditions, inevitable--inevitable.\nIt's the phase we live in, it's to this we have to adapt ourselves. It\nis as little under your control or mine as the movement of the sun\nthrough the zodiac. Practically, that is. And what we have to do is not,\nI think, to sigh for lost homes and the age of gold and spade husbandry,\nand pigs and hens in the home, and so on, but to make this new synthetic\nlife tolerable for the mass of men and women, hopeful for the mass of\nmen and women, a thing developing and ascending. That's where your\nHostels come in, Lady Harman; that's where they're so important. They're\na pioneer movement. If they succeed--and things in Sir Isaac's hands\nhave a way of succeeding at any rate to the paying point--then there'll\nbe a headlong rush of imitations, imitating your good features,\nimitating your bad features, deepening a groove.... You see my point?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"It makes me--more afraid than ever.\"\n\n\"But hopeful,\" said Mr. Brumley, presuming to lay his hand for an\ninstant on her arm. \"It's big enough to be inspiring.\"\n\n\"But I'm afraid,\" she said.\n\n\"It's laying down the lines of a new social life--no less. And what\nmakes it so strange, so typical, too, of the way social forces work\nnowadays, is that your husband, who has all the instinctive insistence\nupon every right and restriction of the family relation in his private\nlife, who is narrowly, passionately _for_ the home in his own case, who\nhates all books and discussion that seem to touch it, should in his\nbusiness activities be striking this tremendous new blow at the ancient\norganization. For that, you see, is what it amounts to.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lady Harman slowly. \"Yes. Of course, he doesn't know....\"\n\nMr. Brumley was silent for a little while. \"You see,\" he resumed, \"at\nthe worst this new social life may become a sort of slavery in barracks;\nat the best--it might become something very wonderful. My mind's been\nbusy now for days thinking just how wonderful the new life might be.\nInstead of the old bickering, crowded family home, a new home of\ncomrades....\"\n\nHe made another pause, and his thoughts ran off upon a fresh track.\n\n\"In looking up all these things I came upon a queer little literature of\npamphlets and so forth, dealing with the case of the shop assistants.\nThey have a great grievance in what they call the living-in system. The\nemployers herd them in dormitories over the shops, and usually feed them\nby gaslight in the basements; they fine them and keep an almost\nintolerable grip upon them; make them go to bed at half-past ten, make\nthem go to church on Sundays,--all sorts of petty tyrannies. The\nassistants are passionately against this, but they've got no power to\nstrike. Where could they go if they struck? Into the street. Only people\nwho live out and have homes of their own to sulk in _can_ strike.\nNaturally, therefore, as a preliminary to any other improvement in the\nshop assistant's life, these young people want to live out. Practically\nthat's an impossible demand at present, because they couldn't get\nlodgings and live out with any decency at all on what it costs their\nemployers to lodge and feed them _in_. Well, here you see a curious\npossibility for your Hostels. You open the prospect of a living-out\nsystem for shop assistants. But just in the degree in which you choose\nto interfere with them, regulate them, bully and deal with them\nwholesale through their employers, do you make the new living-out method\napproximate to the living-in. _That's_ a curious side development, isn't\nit?\"\n\nLady Harman appreciated that.\n\n\"That's only the beginning of the business. There's something more these\nHostels might touch....\"\n\nMr. Brumley gathered himself together for the new aspect. \"There's\nmarriage,\" he said.\n\n\"One of the most interesting and unsatisfactory aspects of the life of\nthe employee to-day--and you know the employee is now in the majority in\nthe adult population--is this. You see, we hold them celibate. We hold\nthem celibate for a longer and longer period; the average age at\nmarriage rises steadily; and so long as they remain celibate we are\nprepared with some sort of ideas about the future development of their\nsocial life, clubs, hostels, living-in, and so forth. But at present we\nhaven't any ideas at all about the adaptation of the natural pairing\ninstinct to the new state of affairs. Ultimately the employee marries;\nthey hold out as long as they possibly can, but ultimately they have to.\nThey have to, even in the face of an economic system that holds out no\nprospects of anything but insecurity and an increasing chance of trouble\nand disaster to the employee's family group. What happens is that they\ndrop back into a distressful, crippled, insecure imitation of the old\nfamily life as one had it in what I might call the multiplying periods\nof history. They start a home,--they dream of a cottage, but they drift\nto a lodging, and usually it isn't the best sort of lodging, for\nlandladies hate wives and the other lodgers detest babies. Often the\nyoung couple doesn't have babies. You see, they are more intelligent\nthan peasants, and intelligence and fecundity vary reciprocally,\" said\nMr. Brumley.\n\n\"You mean?\" interrupted Lady Harman softly.\n\n\"There is a world-wide fall in the birth-rate. People don't have the\nfamilies they did.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lady Harman. \"I understand now.\"\n\n\"And the more prosperous or the more sanguine take these suburban little\nhouses, these hutches that make such places as Hendon nightmares of\nmonotony, or go into ridiculous jerry-built sham cottages in some Garden\nSuburb, where each young wife does her own housework and pretends to\nlike it. They have a sort of happiness for a time, I suppose; the woman\nstops all outside work, the man, very much handicapped, goes on\ncompeting against single men. Then--nothing more happens. Except\ndifficulties. The world goes dull and grey for them. They look about for\na lodger, perhaps. Have you read Gissing's _Paying Guest_?...\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Lady Harman, \"I suppose it is like that. One tries not\nto think it is so.\"\n\n\"One needn't let oneself believe that dullness is unhappiness,\" said Mr.\nBrumley. \"I don't want to paint things sadder than they are. But it's\nnot a fine life, it's not a full life, that life in a Neo-Malthusian\nsuburban hutch.\"\n\n\"Neo----?\" asked Lady Harman.\n\n\"A mere phrase,\" said Mr. Brumley hastily. \"The extraordinary thing is\nthat, until you set me looking into these things with your questions,\nI've always taken this sort of thing for granted, as though it couldn't\nbe otherwise. Now I seem to see with a kind of freshness. I'm astounded\nat the muddle of it, the waste and aimlessness of it. And here again it\nis, Lady Harman, that I think your opportunity comes in. With these\nHostels as they might be projected now, you seem to have the possibility\nof a modernized, more collective and civilized family life than the old\nclose congestion of the single home, and I see no reason at all why you\nshouldn't carry that collective life on to the married stage. As things\nare now these little communities don't go beyond the pairing--and out\nthey drift to find the homestead they will never possess. What has been\nborne in upon me more and more forcibly as I have gone through\nyour--your nest of problems, is the idea that the new social--association,\nthat has so extensively replaced the old family group, might be carried\non right through life, that it might work in with all sorts of other\ndiscontents and bad adjustments.... The life of the women in these little\nchildless or one-or-two-child homes is more unsatisfactory even than the\nman's.\"\n\nMr. Brumley's face flushed with enthusiasm and he wagged a finger to\nemphasize his words. \"Why not make Hostels, Lady Harman, for married\ncouples? Why not try that experiment so many people have talked about of\nthe conjoint kitchen and refectory, the conjoint nursery, the collective\nsocial life, so that the children who are single children or at best\nchildren in small families of two or three, may have the advantages of\nplayfellows, and the young mothers still, if they choose, continue to\nhave a social existence and go on with their professional or business,\nwork? That's the next step your Hostels might take ... Incidentally you\nsee this opens a way to a life of relative freedom for the woman who is\nmarried.... I don't know if you have read Mrs. Stetson. Yes, Charlotte\nPerkins Gilman Stetson.... Yes, _Woman and Economics_, that's the book.\n\n\"I know,\" Mr. Brumley went on, \"I seem to be opening out your project\nlike a concertina, but I want you to see just how my thoughts have been\ngoing about all this. I want you to realize I haven't been idle during\nthese last few weeks. I know it's a far cry from what the Hostels are to\nall these ideas of what they might begin to be, I know the difficulties\nin your way--all sorts of difficulties. But when I think just how you\nstand at the very centre of the moulding forces in these changes....\"\n\nHe dropped into an eloquent silence.\n\nLady Harman looked thoughtfully at the sunlight under the trees.\n\n\"You think,\" she said, \"that it comes to as much as all this.\"\n\n\"More,\" said Mr. Brumley.\n\n\"I was frightened before. _Now_----You make me feel as though someone\nhad put the wheel of a motor car in my hand, started it and told me to\nsteer....\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a77\n\nLady Harman went home from that talk in a taxi, and on the way she\npassed the building operations in Kensington Road. A few weeks ago it\nhad been a mere dusty field of operation for the house-wreckers; now its\nwalls were already rising to the second storey. She realized how swiftly\nnowadays the search for wisdom can be outstripped by reinforced\nconcrete.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a78\n\nIt was only by slow degrees and rather in the absence of a more\ncommanding interest than through any invincible quality in their appeal\nto her mind that these Hostels became in the next three years the grave\noccupation of Lady Harman's thoughts and energies. She yielded to them\nreluctantly. For a long time she wanted to look over them and past them\nand discover something--she did not know what--something high and\ndomineering to which it would be easy to give herself. It was difficult\nto give herself to the Hostels. In that Mr. Brumley, actuated by a\nmixture of more or less admirable motives, did his best to assist her.\nThese Hostels alone he thought could give them something upon which they\ncould meet, give them a common interest and him a method of service and\ncompanionship. It threw the qualities of duty and justification over\ntheir more or less furtive meetings, their little expeditions together,\ntheir quiet frequent association.\n\nTogether they made studies of the Girls' Clubs which are scattered about\nLondon, supplementary homes that have in such places as Walworth and\nSoho worked small miracles of civilization. These institutions appealed\nto a lower social level than the one their Hostels were to touch, but\nthey had been organized by capable and understanding minds and Lady\nHarman found in one or two of their evening dances and in the lunch she\nshared one morning with a row of cheerful young factory girls from Soho\njust that quality of concrete realization for which her mind hungered.\nThen Mr. Brumley took her once or twice for evening walks, just when the\nstream of workers is going home; he battled his way with her along the\nfootpath of Charing Cross Railway Bridge from the Waterloo side, they\nswam in the mild evening sunshine of September against a trampling\ntorrent of bobbing heads, and afterwards they had tea together in one of\nthe International Stores near the Strand, where Mr. Brumley made an\nunsuccessful attempt to draw out the waitress on the subject of Babs\nWheeler and the recent strike. The young woman might have talked freely\nto a man alone or freely to Lady Harman alone but the combination of the\ntwo made her shy. The bridge experience led to several other\nexpeditions, to see home-going on the tube, at the big railway termini,\non the train--and once they followed up the process to Streatham and saw\nhow the people pour out of the train at last and scatter--until at last\nthey are just isolated individuals running up steps, diving into\nbasements. And then it occurred to Mr. Brumley that he knew someone who\nwould take them over \"Gerrard,\" that huge telephone exchange, and there\nLady Harman saw how the National Telephone Company, as it was in those\ndays, had a care for its staff, the pleasant club rooms, the rest room,\nand stood in that queer rendez-vous of messages, where the \"Hello\" girl\nsits all day, wearing a strange metallic apparatus over ear and mouth,\nwatching small lights that wink significantly at her and perpetually\npulling out and slipping in and releasing little flexible strings that\nseem to have a resilient volition of their own. They hunted out Mrs.\nBarnet and heard her ideas about conjoint homes for spinsters in the\nGarden Suburb. And then they went over a Training College for elementary\nteachers and visited the Post Office and then came back to more\nunobtrusive contemplation, from the customer's little table, of the\nministering personalities of the International Stores.\n\nThere were times when all these things seen, seemed to fall into an\nentirely explicable system under Mr. Brumley's exposition, when they\nseemed to be giving and most generously giving the clearest indications\nof what kind of thing the Hostels had to be, and times when this all\nvanished again and her mind became confused and perplexed. She tried to\nexpress just what it was she missed to Mr. Brumley. \"One doesn't,\" she\nsaid, \"see all of them and what one sees isn't what we have to do with.\nI mean we see them dressed up and respectable and busy and then they go\nhome and the door shuts. It's the home that we are going to alter and\nreplace--and what is it like?\" Mr. Brumley took her for walks in\nHighbury and the newer parts of Hendon and over to Clapham. \"I want to\ngo inside those doors,\" she said.\n\n\"That's just what they won't let you do,\" said Mr. Brumley. \"Nobody\nvisits but relations--and prospective relations, and the only other\nsocial intercourse is over the garden wall. Perhaps I can find\nbooks----\"\n\nHe got her novels by Edwin Pugh and Pett Ridge and Frank Swinnerton and\nGeorge Gissing. They didn't seem to be attractive homes. And it seemed\nremarkable to her that no woman had ever given the woman's view of the\nsmall London home from the inside....\n\nShe overcame her own finer scruples and invaded the Burnet household.\nApart from fresh aspects of Susan's character in the capacity of a\nhostess she gained little light from that. She had never felt so\ncompletely outside a home in her life as she did when she was in the\nBurnets' parlour. The very tablecloth on which the tea was spread had an\nair of being new and protective of familiar things; the tea was\nmanifestly quite unlike their customary tea, it was no more intimate\nthan the confectioner's shop window from which it mostly came; the whole\nroom was full of the muffled cries of things hastily covered up and\nspecially put away. Vivid oblongs on the faded wallpaper betrayed even a\nrearrangement of the pictures. Susan's mother was a little dingy woman,\nwearing a very smart new cap to the best of her ability; she had an air\nof having been severely shaken up and admonished, and her general\nbearing confessed only too plainly how shattered those preparations had\nleft her. She watched her capable daughter for cues. Susan's sisters\ndisplayed a disposition to keep their backs against something and at the\nearliest opportunity to get into the passage and leave Susan and her\ntremendous visitor alone but within earshot. They started convulsively\nwhen they were addressed and insisted on \"your ladyship.\" Susan had told\nthem not to but they would. When they supposed themselves to be\nunobserved they gave themselves up to the impassioned inspection of Lady\nHarman's costume. Luke had fled into the street, and in spite of various\nmessages conveyed to him by the youngest sister he refused to enter\nuntil Lady Harman had gone again and was well out of the way. And Susan\nwas no longer garrulous and at her ease; she had no pins in her mouth\nand that perhaps hampered her speech; she presided flushed and\nbright-eyed in a state of infectious nervous tension. Her politeness was\nawful. Never in all her life had Lady Harman felt her own lack of real\nconversational power so acutely. She couldn't think of a thing that\nmightn't be construed as an impertinence and that didn't remind her of\ndistrict visiting. Yet perhaps she succeeded better than she supposed.\n\n\"What a family you have had!\" she said to Mrs. Burnet. \"I have four\nlittle girls, and I find them as much as we can manage.\"\n\n\"You're young yet, my ladyship,\" said Mrs. Burnet, \"and they aren't\nalways the blessings they seem to be. It's the rearing's the\ndifficulty.\"\n\n\"They're all such healthy-looking--people.\"\n\n\"I wish we could get hold of Luke, my ladyship, and show you _'im_. He's\nthat sturdy. And yet when 'e was a little feller----\"\n\nShe was launched for a time on those details that were always so dear to\nthe mothers of the past order of things. Her little spate of\nreminiscences was the only interlude of naturalness in an afternoon of\npainfully constrained behaviour....\n\nLady Harman returned a trifle shamefacedly from this abortive dip into\nrealities to Mr. Brumley's speculative assurance.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a79\n\nWhile Lady Harman was slowly accustoming her mind to this idea that the\ndevelopment of those Hostels was her appointed career in life, so far as\na wife may have a career outside her connubial duties, and while she was\ngetting insensibly to believe in Mr. Brumley's theory of their exemplary\nsocial importance, the Hostels themselves with a haste that she felt\nconstantly was premature, were achieving a concrete existence. They were\ndeveloping upon lines that here and there disregarded Mr. Brumley's\nideas very widely; they gained in practicality what perhaps they lost in\nsocial value, through the entirely indirect relations between Mr.\nBrumley on the one hand and Sir Isaac on the other. For Sir Isaac\nmanifestly did not consider and would have been altogether indisposed to\nconsider Mr. Brumley as entitled to plan or suggest anything of the\nslightest importance in this affair, and whatever of Mr. Brumley reached\nthat gentleman reached him in a very carefully transmitted form as Lady\nHarman's own unaided idea. Sir Isaac had sound Victorian ideas about the\nplace of literature in life. If anyone had suggested to him that\nliterature could supply ideas to practical men he would have had a\nchoking fit, and he regarded Mr. Brumley's sedulous attentions to these\nhostel schemes with feelings, the kindlier elements of whose admixture\nwas a belief that ultimately he would write some elegant and respectful\napproval of the established undertaking.\n\nThe entire admixture of Sir Isaac's feelings towards Mr. Brumley was by\nno means kindly. He disliked any man to come near Lady Harman, any man\nat all; he had a faint uneasiness even about waiters and hotel porters\nand the clergy. Of course he had agreed she should have friends of her\nown and he couldn't very well rescind that without something definite to\ngo upon. But still this persistent follower kept him uneasy. He kept\nthis uneasiness within bounds by reassuring himself upon the point of\nLady Harman's virtuous obedience, and so reassured he was able to temper\nhis distrust with a certain contempt. The man was in love with his wife;\nthat was manifest enough, and dangled after her.... Let him dangle. What\nafter all did he get for it?...\n\nBut occasionally he broke through this complacency, betrayed a fitful\ningenious jealousy, interfered so that she missed appointments and had\nto break engagements. He was now more and more a being of pathological\nmoods. The subtle changes of secretion that were hardening his arteries,\ntightening his breath and poisoning his blood, reflected themselves upon\nhis spirit in an uncertainty of temper and exasperating fatigues and led\nto startling outbreaks. Then for a time he would readjust himself,\nbecome in his manner reasonable again, become accessible.\n\nHe was the medium through which this vision that was growing up in her\nmind of a reorganized social life, had to translate itself, as much as\nit could ever translate itself, into reality. He called these hostels\nher hostels, made her the approver of all he did, but he kept every\nparticle of control in his own hands. All her ideas and desires had to\nbe realized by him. And his attitudes varied with his moods; sometimes\nhe was keenly interested in the work of organization and then he\nterrified her by his bias towards acute economies, sometimes he was\nresentful at the burthen of the whole thing, sometimes he seemed to\nscent Brumley or at least some moral influence behind her mind and met\nher suggestions with a bitter resentment as though any suggestion must\nneeds be a disloyalty to him. There was a remarkable outbreak upon her\nfirst tentative proposal that the hostel system might ultimately be\nextended to married couples.\n\nHe heard her with his lips pressing tighter and tighter together until\nthey were yellow white and creased with a hundred wicked little\nhorizontal creases. Then he interrupted her with silent gesticulations.\nThen words came.\n\n\"I never did, Elly,\" he said. \"I never did. Reely--there are times when\nyou ain't rational. Married couples who're assistants in shops and\nplaces!\"\n\nFor a little while he sought some adequate expression of his point of\nview.\n\n\"Nice thing to go keeping a place for these chaps to have their cheap\nbits of skirt in,\" he said at last.\n\nThen further: \"If a man wants a girl let him work himself up until he\ncan keep her. Married couples indeed!\"\n\nHe began to expand the possibilities of the case with a quite unusual\nvividness. \"Double beds in each cubicle, I suppose,\" he said, and played\nfor a time about this fancy.... \"Well, to hear such an idea from you of\nall people, Elly. I never did.\"\n\nHe couldn't leave it alone. He had to go on to the bitter end with the\nvision she had evoked in his mind. He was jealous, passionately jealous,\nit was only too manifest, of the possible happinesses of these young\npeople. He was possessed by that instinctive hatred for the realized\nlove of others which lies at the base of so much of our moral\nlegislation. The bare thought--whole corridors of bridal chambers!--made\nhis face white and his hand quiver. _His_ young men and young women! The\nfires of a hundred Vigilance Committees blazed suddenly in his reddened\neyes. He might have been a concentrated society for preventing the rapid\nmultiplication of the unfit. The idea of facilitating early marriages\nwas manifestly shameful to him, a disgraceful service to render, a job\nfor Pandarus. What was she thinking of? Elly of all people! Elly who had\nbeen as innocent as driven snow before Georgina came interfering!\n\nIt ended in a fit of abuse and a panting seizure, and for a day or so he\nwas too ill to resume the discussion, to do more than indicate a\ndisgusted aloofness....\n\nAnd then it may be the obscure chemicals at work within him changed\ntheir phase of reaction. At any rate he mended, became gentler, was more\nloving to his wife than he had been for some time and astonished her by\nsaying that if she wanted Hostels for married couples, it wasn't perhaps\nso entirely unreasonable. Selected cases, he stipulated, it would have\nto be and above a certain age limit, sober people. \"It might even be a\ncheck on immorality,\" he said, \"properly managed....\"\n\nBut that was as far as his acquiescence went and Lady Harman was\ndestined to be a widow before she saw the foundation of any Hostel for\nyoung married couples in London.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a710\n\nThe reinforced concrete rose steadily amidst Lady Harman's questionings\nand Mr. Brumley's speculations. The Harmans returned from a recuperative\nvisit to Kissingen, to which Sir Isaac had gone because of a suspicion\nthat his Marienbad specialist had failed to cure him completely in order\nto get him back again, to find the first of the five hostels nearly ripe\nfor its opening. There had to be a manageress and a staff organized and\nneither Lady Harman nor Mr. Brumley were prepared for that sort of\nbusiness. A number of abler people however had become aware of the\nopportunities of the new development and Mrs. Hubert Plessington, that\nbusy publicist, got the Harmans to a helpful little dinner, before Lady\nHarman had the slightest suspicion of the needs that were now so urgent.\nThere shone a neat compact widow, a Mrs. Pembrose, who had buried her\nhusband some eighteen months ago after studying social questions with\nhim with great \u00c3\u00a9clat for ten happy years, and she had done settlement\nwork and Girls' Club work and had perhaps more power of\norganization--given a suitable director to provide for her lack of\ncreativeness, Mrs. Plessington told Sir Isaac, than any other woman in\nLondon. Afterwards Sir Isaac had an opportunity of talking to her; he\ndiscussed the suffrage movement with her and was pleased to find her\nviews remarkably sympathetic with his own. She was, he declared, a\nsensible woman, anxious to hear a man out and capable, it was evident,\nof a detachment from feminist particularism rare in her sex at the\npresent time. Lady Harman had seen less of the lady that evening, she\nwas chiefly struck by her pallor, by a kind of animated silence about\nher, and by the deep impression her capabilities had made on Mr.\nPlessington, who had hitherto seemed to her to be altogether too\noverworked in admiring his wife to perceive the points of any other\nhuman being. Afterwards Lady Harman was surprised to hear from one or\ntwo quite separate people that Mrs. Pembrose was the only possible\nperson to act as general director of the new hostels. Lady\nBeach-Mandarin was so enthusiastic in the matter that she made a\nspecial call. \"You've known her a long time?\" said Lady Harman.\n\n\"Long enough to see what a chance she is!\" said Lady Beach-Mandarin.\n\nLady Harman perceived equivocation. \"Now how long is that really?\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"Count not in years, nor yet in moments on a dial,\" said Lady\nBeach-Mandarin with a fine air of quotation. \"I'm thinking of her quiet\nstrength of character. Mrs. Plessington brought her round to see me the\nother afternoon.\"\n\n\"Did she talk to you?\"\n\n\"I saw, my dear, I saw.\"\n\nA vague aversion from Mrs. Pembrose was in some mysterious way\nstrengthened in Lady Harman by this extraordinary convergence of\ntestimony. When Sir Isaac mentioned the lady with a kind of forced\ncasualness at breakfast as the only conceivable person for the work of\ninitiation and organization that lay before them, Lady Harman determined\nto see more of her. With a quickened subtlety she asked her to tea. \"I\nhave heard so much of your knowledge of social questions and I want you\nto advise me about my work,\" she wrote, and then scribbled a note to Mr.\nBrumley to call and help her judgments.\n\nMrs. Pembrose appeared dressed in dove colour with a near bonnetesque\nstraw hat to match. She had a pale slightly freckled complexion, little\nhard blue-grey eyes with that sort of nose which redeems a squarish\nshape by a certain delicacy of structure; her chin was long and\nprotruding and her voice had a wooden resonance and a ghost of a lisp.\nHer talk had a false consecutiveness due to the frequent use of the word\n\"Yes.\" Her bearing was erect and her manner guardedly alert.\n\nFrom the first she betrayed a conviction that Mr. Brumley was incidental\nand unnecessary and that her real interest lay with Sir Isaac. She might\nalmost have been in possession of special information upon that point.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"I'm rather specially _up_ in this sort of question. I\nworked side by side with my poor Frederick all his life, we were\ncollaborators, and this question of the urban distributive employee was\none of his special studies. Yes, he would have been tremendously\ninterested in Sir Isaac's project.\"\n\n\"You know what we are doing?\"\n\n\"Every one is interested in Sir Isaac's enterprise. Naturally. Yes, I\nthink I have a fairly good idea of what you mean to do. It's a great\nexperiment.\"\n\n\"You think it is likely to answer?\" said Mr. Brumley.\n\n\"In Sir Isaac's hands it is _very_ likely to answer,\" said Mrs. Pembrose\nwith her eye steadily on Lady Harman.\n\nThere was a little pause. \"Yes, now you wrote of difficulties and\ndrawing upon my experience. Of course just now I'm quite at Sir Isaac's\ndisposal.\"\n\nLady Harman found herself thrust perforce into the r\u00c3\u00b4le of her husband's\nspokeswoman. She asked Mrs. Pembrose if she knew the exact nature of the\nexperiment they contemplated.\n\nMrs. Pembrose hadn't a doubt she knew. Of course for a long time and\nmore especially in the Metropolis where the distances were so great and\nincreasing so rapidly, there had been a gathering feeling not only in\nthe catering trade, but in very many factory industries, against the\ndaily journey to employment and home again. It was irksome and wasteful\nto everyone concerned, there was a great loss in control, later hours of\nbeginning, uncertain service. \"Yes, my husband calculated the hours lost\nin London every week, hours that are neither work nor play, mere\ntiresome stuffy journeying. It made an enormous sum. It worked out at\nhundreds of working lives per week.\" Sir Isaac's project was to abolish\nall that, to bring his staff into line with the drapers and grocers who\nkept their assistants on the living-in system....\n\n\"I thought people objected to the living-in system,\" said Mr. Brumley.\n\n\"There's an agitation against it on the part of a small Trade Union of\nShop Assistants,\" said Mrs. Pembrose. \"But they have no real alternative\nto propose.\"\n\n\"And this isn't Living In,\" said Mr. Brumley.\n\n\"Yes, I think you'll find it is,\" said Mrs. Pembrose with a nice little\nexpert smile.\n\n\"Living-in isn't _quite_ what we want,\" said Lady Harman slowly and with\nknitted brows, seeking a method of saying just what the difference was\nto be.\n\n\"Yes, not perhaps in the strictest sense,\" said Mrs. Pembrose giving her\nno chance, and went on to make fine distinctions. Strictly speaking,\nliving-in meant sleeping over the shop and eating underneath it, and\nthis hostel idea was an affair of a separate house and of occupants who\nwould be assistants from a number of shops. \"Yes, collectivism, if you\nlike,\" said Mrs. Pembrose. But the word collectivism, she assured them,\nwouldn't frighten her, she was a collectivist, a socialist, as her\nhusband had always been. The day was past when socialist could be used\nas a term of reproach. \"Yes, instead of the individual employer of\nlabour, we already begin to have the collective employer of labour, with\na labour bureau--and so on. We share them. We no longer compete for\nthem. It's the keynote of the time.\"\n\nMr. Brumley followed this with a lifted eyebrow. He was still new to\nthese modern developments of collectivist ideas, this socialism of the\nemployer.\n\nThe whole thing Mrs. Pembrose declared was a step forward in\ncivilization, it was a step in the organization and discipline of\nlabour. Of course the unruly and the insubordinate would cry out. But\nthe benefits were plain enough, space, light, baths, association,\nreasonable recreations, opportunities for improvement----\n\n\"But freedom?\" said Mr. Brumley.\n\nMrs. Pembrose inclined her head a little on one side, looked at him this\ntime and smiled the expert smile again. \"If you knew as much as I do of\nthe difficulties of social work,\" she said, \"you wouldn't be very much\nin love with freedom.\"\n\n\"But--it's the very substance of the soul!\"\n\n\"You must permit me to differ,\" said Mrs. Pembrose, and for weeks\nafterwards Mr. Brumley was still seeking a proper polite retort to that\ndifficult counterstroke. It was such a featureless reply. It was like\nhaving your nose punched suddenly by a man without a face.\n\nThey descended to a more particular treatment of the problems ahead.\nMrs. Pembrose quoted certain precedents from the Girls' Club Union.\n\n\"The people Lady Harman contemplates--entertaining,\" said Mr. Brumley,\n\"are of a slightly more self-respecting type than those young women.\"\n\n\"It's largely veneer,\" said Mrs. Pembrose....\n\n\"Detestable little wretch,\" said Mr. Brumley when at last she had\ndeparted. He was very uncomfortable. \"She's just the quintessence of all\none fears and dreads about these new developments, she's perfect--in\nthat way--self-confident, arrogant, instinctively aggressive, with a\ntremendous class contempt. There's a multitude of such people about who\nhate the employed classes, who _want_ to see them broken in and\nsubjugated. I suppose that kind of thing is in humanity. Every boy's\nschool has louts of that kind, who love to torment fags for their own\ngood, who spring upon a chance smut on the face of a little boy to scrub\nhim painfully, who have a kind of lust to dominate under the pretence of\nimproving. I remember----But never mind that now. Keep that woman out of\nthings or your hostels work for the devil.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lady Harman. \"Certainly she shall not----. No.\"\n\nBut there she reckoned without her husband.\n\n\"I've settled it,\" he said to her at dinner two nights later.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Pembrose.\"\n\n\"You've not made her----?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have. And I think we're very lucky to get her.\"\n\n\"But--Isaac! I don't want her!\"\n\n\"You should have told me that before, Elly. I've made an agreement.\"\n\nShe suddenly wanted to cry. \"But----You said I should manage these\nHostels myself.\"\n\n\"So you shall, Elly. But we must have somebody. When we go abroad and\nall that and for all the sort of business stuff and looking after things\nthat you can't do. We've _got_ to have her. She's the only thing going\nof her sort.\"\n\n\"But--I don't like her.\"\n\n\"Well,\" cried Sir Isaac, \"why in goodness couldn't you tell me that\nbefore, Elly? I've been and engaged her.\"\n\nShe sat pale-faced staring at him with wide open eyes in which tears of\nacute disappointment were shining. She did not dare another word because\nof her trick of weeping.\n\n\"It's all right, Elly,\" said Sir Isaac. \"How touchy you are! Anything\nyou want about these Hostels of yours, you've only got to tell me and\nit's done.\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a711\n\nLady Harman was still in a state of amazement at the altered prospects\nof her hostels when the day arrived for the formal opening of the first\nof these in Bloomsbury. They made a little public ceremony of it in\nspite of her reluctance, and Mr. Brumley had to witness things from out\nof the general crowd and realize just how completely he wasn't in it, in\nspite of all his efforts. Mrs. Pembrose was modestly conspicuous, like\nthe unexpected in all human schemes. There were several reporters\npresent, and Horatio Blenker who was going to make a loyal leader about\nit, to be followed by one or two special articles for the _Old Country\nGazette_.\n\nHoratio had procured Mrs. Blapton for the opening after some ineffectual\nangling for the Princess Adeline, and the thing was done at half-past\nthree in the afternoon. In the bright early July sunshine outside the\nnew building there was a crimson carpet down on the pavement and an\nawning above it, there was a great display of dog-daisies at the windows\nand on the steps leading up to the locked portals, an increasing number\nof invited people lurked shyly in the ground-floor rooms ready to come\nout by the back way and cluster expectantly when Mrs. Blapton arrived,\nGraper the staff manager and two assistants in dazzling silk hats seemed\neverywhere, the rabbit-like architect had tried to look doggish in a\nhuge black silk tie and only looked more like a rabbit than ever, and\nthere was a steady driftage of small boys and girls, nurses with\nperambulators, cab touts, airing grandfathers and similar unemployed\npeople towards the promise of the awning, the carpet and the flowers.\nThe square building in all its bravery of Doulton ware and yellow and\nmauve tiles and its great gilt inscription\n\nINTERNATIONAL HOSTELS\n\nabove the windows of the second storey seemed typical of all those\nmodern forces that are now invading and dispelling the ancient\nresidential peace of Bloomsbury.\n\nMrs. Blapton appeared only five minutes late, escorted by Bertie Trevor\nand her husband's spare secretary. Graper became so active at the sight\nof her that he seemed more like some beast out of the Apocalypse with\nseven hands and ten hats than a normal human being; he marshalled the\nsignificant figures into their places, the door was unlocked without\nserious difficulty, and Lady Harman found herself in the main corridor\nbeside Mr. Trevor and a little behind Mrs. Blapton, engaged in being\nshown over the new creation. Sir Isaac (driven by Graper at his elbow)\nwas in immediate attendance on the great political lady, and Mrs.\nPembrose, already with an air of proprietorship, explained glibly on her\nother hand. Close behind Lady Harman came Lady Beach-Mandarin, expanding\nlike an appreciative gas in a fine endeavour to nestle happily into the\nwhole big place, and with her were Mrs. Hubert Plessington and Mr. Pope,\none of those odd people who are called publicists because one must call\nthem something, and who take chairs and political sides and are\nvice-presidents of everything and organize philanthropies, write letters\nto the papers and cannot let the occasion pass without saying a few\nwords and generally prevent the institutions of this country from\nfalling out of human attention. He was a little abstracted in his\nmanner, every now and then his lips moved as he imagined a fresh turn to\nsome classic platitude; anyone who knew him might have foretold the\nspeech into which he presently broke. He did this in the refectory where\nthere was a convenient step up at the end. Beginning with the customary\nconfession of incontinence, \"could not let the occasion pass,\" he\ndeclared that he would not detain them long, but he felt that everyone\nthere would agree with him that they shared that day in no slight\noccasion, no mean enterprise, that here was one of the most promising,\none of the most momentous, nay! he would go further and add with due\ndeference to them all, one of the most pregnant of social experiments in\nmodern social work. In the past he had himself--if he might for a moment\nallow a personal note to creep into his observations, he himself had not\nbeen unconnected with industrial development.--(Querulous voice, \"Who\nthe devil is that?\" and whispered explanations on the part of Horatio\nBlenker; \"Pope--very good man--East Purblow Experiment--Payment in Kind\ninstead of Wages--Yes.\")....\n\nLady Harman ceased to listen to Mr. Pope's strained but not unhappy\ntenor. She had heard him before, and she had heard his like endlessly.\nHe was the larger moiety of every public meeting she had ever attended.\nShe had ceased even to marvel at the dull self-satisfaction that\npossessed him. To-day her capacity for marvelling was entirely taken up\nby the details of this extraordinary reality which had sprung from her\ndream of simple, kindly, beautiful homes for distressed and overworked\nyoung women; nothing in the whole of life had been so amazing since that\nlurid occasion when she had been the agonized vehicle for the entry of\nMiss Millicent Harman upon this terrestrial scene. It was all so\nentirely what she could never have thought possible. A few words from\nother speakers followed, Mrs. Blapton, with the young secretary at hand\nto prompt, said something, and Sir Isaac was poked forwards to say,\n\"Thank you very much. It's all my wife's doing, really.... Oh dash it!\nThank you very much.\" It had the effect of being the last vestige of\nsome more elaborate piece of eloquence that had suddenly disintegrated\nin his mind.\n\n\"And now, Elly,\" he said, as their landaulette took them home, \"you're\nbeginning to have your hostels.\"\n\n\"Then they _are_ my hostels?\" she asked abruptly.\n\n\"Didn't I say they were?\" The satisfaction of his face was qualified by\nthat fatigued irritability that nowadays always followed any exertion or\nexcitement.\n\n\"If I want things done? If I want things altered?\"\n\n\"Of course you may, of course you may. What's the matter with you,\nElly? What's been putting ideers into your head? You got to have a\ndirectress to the thing; you must have a woman of education who knows a\nbit about things to look after the matrons and so on. Very likely she\nisn't everything you want. She's the only one we could get, and I don't\nsee----. Here I go and work hard for a year and more getting these\nthings together to please you, and then suddenly you don't like 'em.\nThere's a lot of the spoilt child in you, Elly--first and last. There\nthey are....\"\n\nThey were silent for the rest of the journey to Putney, both being\nfilled with incommunicable things.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a712\n\nAnd now Lady Harman began to share the trouble of all those who let\ntheir minds pass out of the circle of their immediate affections with\nany other desire save interest and pleasure. Assisted in this unhappy\ndevelopment by the sedulous suggestions of Mr. Brumley she had begun to\noffend against the most sacred law in our sensible British code, she was\nbeginning to take herself and her hostels seriously, and think that it\nmattered how she worked for them and what they became. She tried to give\nall the attention her children's upbringing, her husband's ailments and\nthe general demands of her household left free, to this complex,\nelusive, puzzling and worrying matter. Instead of thinking that these\nhostels were just old hostels and that you start them and put in a Mrs.\nPembrose and feel very benevolent and happy and go away, she had come to\nrealize partly by dint of her own conscientious thinking and partly\nthrough Mr. Brumley's strenuous resolve that she should not take Sir\nIsaac's gift horse without the most exhaustive examination of its\nquality, that this new work, like most new things in human life, was\ncapable not only of admirable but of altogether detestable consequences,\nand that it rested with her far more than with any other human being to\nrealize the former and avoid the latter. And directly one has got to\nthis critical pose towards things, just as one ceases to be content with\nthings anyhow and to want them precisely somehow, one begins to realize\njust how intractable, confused and disingenuous are human affairs. Mr.\nBrumley had made himself see and had made her see how inevitable these\nbig wholesale ways of doing things, these organizations and close social\nco-operations, have become unless there is to be a social disintegration\nand set back, and he had also brought himself and her to realize how\neasily they may develop into a new servitude, how high and difficult is\nthe way towards methods of association that will ensure freedom and\npermit people to live fine individual lives. Every step towards\norganization raises a crop of vices peculiar to itself, fresh\ndevelopments of the egotism and greed and vanity of those into whose\nhands there falls control, fresh instances of that hostile pedantry\nwhich seems so natural to officials and managers, insurgencies and\nobstinacies and suspicions on the part of everyone. The poor lady had\nsupposed that when one's intentions were obviously benevolent everyone\nhelped. She only faced the realities of this task that she had not so\nmuch set for herself as had happened to her, after dreadful phases of\ndisillusionment and dismay.\n\n\"These hostels,\" said Mr. Brumley in his most prophetic mood, \"can be\nmade free, fine things--or no--just as all the world of men we are\nliving in, could be made a free, fine world. And it's our place to see\nthey are that. It's just by being generous and giving ourselves, helping\nwithout enslaving, and giving without exacting gratitude, planning and\nprotecting with infinite care, that we bring that world nearer.... Since\nI've known you I've come to know such things are possible....\"\n\nThe Bloomsbury hostel started upon its career with an embarrassing\ndifficulty. The young women of the International Stores Refreshment\nDepartments for whom these institutions were primarily intended\ndisplayed what looked extremely like a concerted indisposition to come\nin. They had been circularized and informed that henceforth, to ensure\nthe \"good social tone\" of the staff, all girls not living at home with\ntheir parents or close relations would be expected to reside in the new\nhostels. There followed an attractive account of the advantages of the\nnew establishment. In drawing up this circular with the advice of Mrs.\nPembrose, Sir Isaac had overlooked the fact that his management was very\nimperfectly informed just where the girls did live, and that after its\nissue it was very improbable that it would be possible to find out this\nvery necessary fact. But the girls seemed to be unaware of this\nignorance at headquarters, Miss Babs Wheeler was beginning to feel a\nlittle bored by good behaviour and crave for those dramatic cessations\nat the lunch hour, those speeches, with cheers, from a table top, those\ninterviews with reporters, those flushed and eager councils of war and\nall the rest of that good old crisis feeling that had previously ended\nso happily. Mr. Graper came to his proprietor headlong, Mrs. Pembrose\nwas summoned and together they contemplated the lamentable possibility\nof this great social benefit they had done the world being discredited\nat the outset by a strike of the proposed beneficiaries. Sir Isaac fell\ninto a state of vindictiveness and was with difficulty restrained by Mr.\nGraper from immediately concluding the negotiations that were pending\nwith three great Oxford Street firms that would have given over the\nhostels to their employees and closed them against the International\ngirls for ever.\n\nEven Mrs. Pembrose couldn't follow Sir Isaac in that, and remarked: \"As\nI understand it, the whole intention was to provide proper housing for\nour own people first and foremost.\"\n\n\"And haven't we provided it, _damn_ them?\" said Sir Isaac in white\ndesperation....\n\nIt was Lady Harman who steered the newly launched institutions through\nthese first entanglements. It was her first important advantage in the\nstruggle that had hitherto been going relentlessly against her. She now\ndisplayed her peculiar gift, a gift that indeed is unhappily all too\nrare among philanthropists, the gift of not being able to classify the\npeople with whom she was dealing, but of continuing to regard them as a\nmultitude of individualized souls as distinct and considerable as\nherself. That makes no doubt for slowness and \"inefficiency\" and\ncomplexity in organization, but it does make for understandings. And\nnow, through a little talk with Susan Burnet about her sister's attitude\nupon the dispute, she was able to take the whole situation in the flank.\n\nLike many people who are not easily clear, Lady Harman when she was\nclear acted with very considerable decision, which was perhaps none the\nless effective because of the large softnesses of her manner.\n\nShe surprised Sir Isaac by coming of her own accord into his study,\nwhere with an altogether novel disfavour he sat contemplating the\ndetailed plans for the Sydenham Hostel. \"I think I've found out what the\ntrouble is,\" she said.\n\n\"What trouble?\"\n\n\"About my hostel.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"I've been finding out what the girls are saying.\"\n\n\"They'd say anything.\"\n\n\"I don't think they're clever enough for that,\" said Lady Harman after\nconsideration. She recovered her thread. \"You see, Isaac, they've been\nfrightened by the Rules. I didn't know you had printed a set of Rules.\"\n\n\"One must _have_ rules, Elly.\"\n\n\"In the background,\" she decided. \"But you see these Rules--were made\nconspicuous. They were printed in two colours on wall cards just exactly\nlike that list of rules and scale of fines you had to withdraw----\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Sir Isaac, shortly.\n\n\"It reminded the girls. And that circular that seems to threaten them if\nthey don't give up their lodgings and come in. And the way the front is\ngot up to look just exactly like one of the refreshment-room\nbranches--it makes them feel it will be un-homelike, and that there will\nbe a kind of repetition in the evening of all the discipline and\nregulations they have to put up with during the day.\"\n\n\"Have to put up with!\" murmured Sir Isaac.\n\n\"I wish that had been thought of sooner. If we had made the places look\na little more ordinary and called them Osborne House or something a\nlittle old-fashioned like that, something with a touch of the Old Queen\nabout it and all that kind of thing.\"\n\n\"We can't go to the expense of taking down all those big gilt letters\njust to please the fancies of Miss Babs Wheeler.\"\n\n\"It's too late now to do that, perhaps. But we could do something, I\nthink, to remove the suspicions ... I want, Isaac----I think----\" She\npulled herself together to announce her determination. \"I think if I\nwere to go to the girls and meet a delegation of them, and just talk to\nthem plainly about what we mean by this hostel.\"\n\n\"_You_ can't go making speeches.\"\n\n\"It would just be talking to them.\"\n\n\"It's such a Come Down,\" said Sir Isaac, after a momentary contemplation\nof the possibility.\n\nFor some time they talked without getting very far from these positions\nthey had assumed. At last Sir Isaac shifted back upon his expert. \"Can't\nwe talk about it to Mrs. Pembrose? She knows more about this sort of\nbusiness than we do.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to talk to Mrs. Pembrose,\" said Lady Harman, after a\nlittle interval. Some unusual quality in her quiet voice made Sir Isaac\nlift his eyes to her face for a moment.\n\nSo one Saturday afternoon, Lady Harman had a meeting with a roomful of\nrecalcitrant girls at the Regent Street Refreshment Branch, which looked\nvery odd to her with grey cotton wrappers over everything and its blinds\ndown, and for the first time she came face to face with the people for\nwhom almost in spite of herself she was working. It was a meeting\nsummoned by the International Branch of the National Union of Waitresses\nand Miss Babs Wheeler and Mr. Graper were so to speak the north and\nsouth poles of the little group upon the improvised platform from which\nLady Harman was to talk to the gathering. She would have liked the\nsupport of Mr. Brumley, but she couldn't contrive any unostentatious way\nof bringing him into the business without putting it upon a footing that\nwould have involved the appearance of Sir Isaac and Mrs. Pembrose\nand--everybody. And essentially it wasn't to be everybody. It was to be\na little talk.\n\nLady Harman rather liked the appearance of Miss Babs Wheeler, and met\nmore than an answering approval in that insubordinate young woman's eye.\nMiss Wheeler was a minute swaggering person, much akimbo, with a little\nround blue-eyed innocent face that shone with delight at the lark of\nliving. Her three companions who were in the lobby with her to receive\nand usher in Lady Harman seemed just as young, but they were relatively\nunilluminated except by their manifest devotion to their leader. They\ndisplayed rather than concealed their opinion of her as a \"dear\" and a\n\"fair wonder.\" And the meeting generally it seemed to her was a\ngathering of very human young women, rather restless, then agog to see\nher and her clothes, and then somehow allayed by her appearance and\nquite amiably attentive to what she had to say. A majority were young\ngirls dressed with the cheap smartness of the suburbs, the rest were for\nthe most part older and dingier, and here and there were dotted young\nladies of a remarkable and questionable smartness. In the front row,\nfull of shy recognitions and a little disguised by an unfamiliar hat was\nSusan's sister Alice.\n\nAs Lady Harman had made up her mind that she was not going to deliver a\nspeech she felt no diffidence in speaking. She was far too intent on her\nmessage to be embarrassed by any thought of the effect she was\nproducing. She talked as she might have talked in one of her easier\nmoods to Mr. Brumley. And as she talked it happened that Miss Babs\nWheeler and quite a number of the other girls present watched her face\nand fell in love with her.\n\nShe began with her habitual prelude. \"You see,\" she said, and stopped\nand began again. She wanted to tell them and with a clumsy simplicity\nshe told them how these Hostels had arisen out of her desire that they\nshould have something better than the uncomfortable lodgings in which\nthey lived. They weren't a business enterprise, but they weren't any\nsort of charity. \"And I wanted them to be the sort of place in which you\nwould feel quite free. I hadn't any sort of intention of having you\ninterfered with. I hate being interfered with myself, and I understand\njust as well as anyone can that you don't like it either. I wanted these\nHostels to be the sort of place that you might perhaps after a time\nalmost manage and run for yourselves. You might have a committee or\nsomething.... Only you know it isn't always easy to do as one wants.\nThings don't always go in this world as one wants them to\ngo--particularly if one isn't clever.\" She lost herself for a moment at\nthat point, and then went on to say she didn't like the new rules. They\nhad been drawn up in a hurry and she had only read them after they were\nprinted. All sorts of things in them----\n\nShe seemed to be losing her theme again, and Mr. Graper handed her the\noffending card, a big varnished wall placard, with eyelets and tape\ncomplete. She glanced at it. For example, she said, it wasn't her idea\nto have fines. (Great and long continued applause.) There was something\nshe had always disliked about fines. (Renewed applause.) But these\nrules could easily be torn up. And as she said this and as the meeting\nbroke into acquiescence again it occurred to her that there was the card\nof rules in her hands, and nothing could be simpler than to tear it up\nthere and then. It resisted her for a moment, she compressed her lips\nand then she had it in halves. This tearing was so satisfactory to her\nthat she tore it again and then again. As she tore it, she had a\npleasant irrational feeling that she was tearing Mrs. Pembrose. Mr.\nGraper's face betrayed his shocked feelings, and the meeting which had\nbecome charged with a strong desire to show how entirely it approved of\nher, made a crowning attempt at applause. They hammered umbrellas on the\nfloor, they clapped hands, they rattled chairs and gave a shrill cheer.\nA chair was broken.\n\n\"I wish,\" said Lady Harman when that storm had abated, \"you'd come and\nlook at the Hostel. Couldn't you come next Saturday afternoon? We could\nhave a stand-up tea and you could see the place and then afterwards your\ncommittee and I--and my husband--could make out a real set of rules....\"\n\nShe went on for some little time longer, she appealed to them with all\nthe strength of her honest purpose to help her to make this possible\ngood thing a real good thing, not to suspect, not to be hard on\nher--\"and my husband\"--not to make a difficult thing impossible, it was\nso easy to do that, and when she finished she was in the happiest\npossession of her meeting. They came thronging round her with flushed\nfaces and bright eyes, they wanted to come near her, wanted to touch\nher, wanted to assure her that for her they were quite prepared to live\nin any kind of place. For her. \"You come and talk to us, Lady Harman,\"\nsaid one; \"_we'll_ show you.\"\n\n\"Nobody hasn't told us, Lady Harman, how these Hostels were _yours_.\"\n\n\"You come and talk to us again, Lady Harman.\" ...\n\nThey didn't wait for the following Saturday. On Monday morning Mrs.\nPembrose received thirty-seven applications to take up rooms.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a713\n\nFor the next few years it was to be a matter of recurrent\nheart-searching for Lady Harman whether she had been profoundly wise or\nextremely foolish in tearing up that card of projected rules. At the\ntime it seemed the most natural and obvious little action imaginable; it\nwas long before she realized just how symbolical and determining a few\nmovements of the hand and wrist can be. It fixed her line not so much\nfor herself as for others. It put her definitely, much more definitely\nthan her convictions warranted, on the side of freedom against\ndiscipline. For indeed her convictions like most of our convictions kept\nalong a tortuous watershed between these two. It is only a few rare\nextravagant spirits who are wholly for the warp or wholly for the woof\nof human affairs.\n\nThe girls applauded and loved her. At one stroke she had acquired the\nterrible liability of partisans. They made her their champion and\nsanction; she was responsible for an endless succession of difficulties\nthat flowered out of their interpretations of her act. These Hostels\nthat had seemed passing out of her control, suddenly turned back upon\nher and took possession of her.\n\nAnd they were never simple difficulties. Right and wrong refused to\nunravel for her; each side of every issue seemed to be so often in\nsuicidal competition with its antagonist for the inferior case. If the\nforces of order and discipline showed themselves perennially harsh and\nnarrow, it did not blind her perplexed eyes to the fact that the girls\nwere frequently extremely naughty. She wished very often, she did so\nwish--they wouldn't be. They set out with a kind of eagerness for\nconflict.\n\nTheir very loyalty to her expressed itself not so much in any sustained\nattempt to make the hostels successful as in cheering inconveniently, in\nembarrassing declarations of a preference, in an ingenious and\nsystematic rudeness to anyone suspected of imperfect devotion to her.\nThe first comers into the Hostels were much more like the swelling\ninrush of a tide than, as Mrs. Pembrose would have preferred, like\nsomething laid on through a pipe, and when this lady wanted to go on\nwith the old rules until Sir Isaac had approved of the new, the new\narrivals went into the cutting-out room and manifested. Lady Harman had\nto be telephoned for to allay the manifestation.\n\nAnd then arose questions of deportment, trivial in themselves, but of\nthe gravest moment for the welfare of the hostels. There was a phrase\nabout \"noisy or improper conduct\" in the revised rules. Few people would\nsuspect a corridor, ten feet wide and two hundred feet long, as a\ntemptation to impropriety, but Mrs. Pembrose found it was so. The effect\nof the corridors upon undisciplined girls quite unaccustomed to\ncorridors was for a time most undesirable. For example they were moved\nto _run_ along them violently. They ran races along them, when they\novertook they jostled, when they were overtaken they squealed. The\naverage velocity in the corridors of the lady occupants of the\nBloomsbury Hostel during the first fortnight of its existence was seven\nmiles an hour. Was that violence? Was that impropriety? The building was\nall steel construction, but one _heard_ even in the Head Matron's room.\nAnd then there was the effect of the rows and rows of windows opening\nout upon the square. The square had some pleasant old trees and it was\nattractive to look down into their upper branches, where the sparrows\nmobbed and chattered perpetually, and over them at the chimneys and\nturrets and sky signs of the London world. The girls looked. So far they\nwere certainly within their rights. But they did not look modestly, they\ndid not look discreetly. They looked out of wide-open windows, they even\nsat perilously and protrudingly on the window sills conversing across\nthe fa\u00c3\u00a7ade from window to window, attracting attention, and once to Mrs.\nPembrose's certain knowledge a man in the street joined in. It was on a\nSunday morning, too, a Bloomsbury Sunday morning!\n\nBut graver things were to rouse the preventive prohibitionist in the\nsoul of Mrs. Pembrose. There was the visiting of one another's rooms and\ncubicles. Most of these young people had never possessed or dreamt of\npossessing a pretty and presentable apartment to themselves, and the\nfirst effect of this was to produce a decorative outbreak, a vigorous\nframing of photographs and hammering of nails (\"dust-gathering\nlitter.\"--_Mrs. Pembrose_) and then--visiting. They visited at all hours\nand in all costumes; they sat in groups of three or four, one on the\nchair and the rest on the bed conversing into late hours,--entirely\nuncensored conversations too often accompanied by laughter. When Mrs.\nPembrose took this to Lady Harman she found her extraordinarily blind to\nthe conceivable evils of this free intercourse. \"But Lady Harman!\" said\nMrs. Pembrose, with a note of horror, \"some of them--kiss each other!\"\n\n\"But if they're fond of each other,\" said Lady Harman. \"I'm sure I don't\nsee----\"\n\nAnd when the floor matrons were instructed to make little surprise\nvisits up and down the corridors the girls who occupied rooms took to\nlocking their doors--and Lady Harman seemed inclined to sustain their\nright to do that. The floor matrons did what they could to exercise\nauthority, one or two were former department manageresses, two were\nex-elementary teachers, crowded out by younger and more certificated\nrivals, one, and the most trustworthy one, Mrs. Pembrose found, was an\nex-wardress from Holloway. The natural result of these secret talkings\nand conferrings in the rooms became apparent presently in some mild\nragging and in the concoction of petty campaigns of annoyance designed\nto soften the manners of the more authoritative floor matrons. Here\nagain were perplexing difficulties. If a particular floor matron has a\nclear commanding note in her voice, is it or is it not \"violent and\nimproper\" to say \"Haw!\" in clear commanding tones whenever you suppose\nher to be within earshot? As for the door-locking Mrs. Pembrose settled\nthat by carrying off all the keys.\n\nComplaints and incidents drifted towards definite scenes and\n\"situations.\" Both sides in this continuing conflict of dispositions\nwere so definite, so intolerant, to the mind of the lady with the\nperplexed dark eyes who mediated. Her reason was so much with the\nmatrons; her sympathies so much with the girls. She did not like the\nassured brevity of Mrs. Pembrose's judgments and decisions; she had an\ninstinctive perception of the truth that all compact judgments upon\nhuman beings are unjust judgments. The human spirit is but poorly\nadapted either to rule or to be ruled, and the honesty of all the\nefforts of Mrs. Pembrose and her staffs--for soon the hostels at\nSydenham and West Kensington were open--were marred not merely by\narrogance but by an irritability, a real hostility to complexities and\ndifficulties and resisters and troublesome characters. And it did not\nhelp the staff to a triumphant achievement of its duties that the girls\nhad an exaggerated perception that Lady Harman's heart was on their\nside.\n\nAnd presently the phrase \"weeding out\" crept into the talk of Mrs.\nPembrose. Some of the girls were being marked as ringleaders, foci of\nmischief, characters it was desirable to \"get rid of.\" Confronted with\nit Lady Harman perceived she was absolutely opposed to this idea of\ngetting rid of anyone--unless it was Mrs. Pembrose. She liked her\nvarious people; she had no desire for a whittled success with a picked\nremnant of subdued and deferential employees. She put that to Mr.\nBrumley and Mr. Brumley was indignant and eloquent in his concurrence. A\ncertain Mary Trunk, a dark young woman with a belief that it became her\nto have a sweet disorder in her hair, and a large blond girl named Lucy\nBaxandall seemed to be the chief among the bad influences of the\nBloomsbury hostel, and they took it upon themselves to appeal to Lady\nHarman against Mrs. Pembrose. They couldn't, they complained, \"do a\nThing right for her....\"\n\nSo the tangle grew.\n\nPresently Lady Harman had to go to the Riviera with Sir Isaac and when\nshe came back Mary Trunk and Lucy Baxandall had vanished from both the\nInternational Hostel and the International Stores. She tried to find out\nwhy, and she was confronted by inadequate replies and enigmatical\nsilences. \"They decided to go,\" said Mrs. Pembrose, and dropped\n\"fortunately\" after that statement. She disavowed any exact knowledge of\ntheir motives. But she feared the worst. Susan Burnet was uninforming.\nWhatever had happened had failed to reach Alice Burnet's ears. Lady\nHarman could not very well hold a commission of enquiry into the matter,\nbut she had an uneasy sense of a hidden campaign of dislodgement. And\nabout the corridors and cubicles and club rooms there was she thought a\ndifference, a discretion, a flavour of subjugation....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE ELEVENTH\n\nTHE LAST CRISIS\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a71\n\nIt would be quite easy for anyone with the knack of reserve to go on\nfrom this point with a history of Lady Harman that would present her as\npractically a pure philanthropist. For from these beginnings she was\ndestined to proceed to more and more knowledge and understanding and\nclear purpose and capable work in this interesting process of collective\nregrouping, this process which may even at last justify Mr. Brumley's\ncourageous interpretations and prove to be an early experiment in the\nbeginning of a new social order. Perhaps some day there will be an\nofficial biography, another addition to the inscrutable records of\nBritish public lives, in which all these things will be set out with\ntact and dignity. Horatio Blenker or Adolphus Blenker may survive to be\nentrusted with this congenial task. She will be represented as a tall\ninanimate person pursuing one clear benevolent purpose in life from her\nvery beginning, and Sir Isaac and her relations with Sir Isaac will be\nrescued from reality. The book will be illustrated by a number of\ncarefully posed photographer's photographs of her, studies of the Putney\nhouse and perhaps an unappetizing woodcut of her early home at Penge.\nThe aim of all British biography is to conceal. A great deal of what we\nhave already told will certainly not figure in any such biography, and\nstill more certainly will the things we have yet to tell be missing.\n\nLady Harman was indeed only by the force of circumstances and\nintermittently a pure philanthropist, and it is with the intercalary\npassages of less exalted humanity that we are here chiefly concerned. At\ntimes no doubt she did really come near to filling and fitting and\nbecoming identical with that figure of the pure philanthropist which was\nher world-ward face, but for the most part that earnest and dignified\nfigure concealed more or less extensive spaces of nothingness, while the\nerrant soul of the woman within strayed into less exalted ways of\nthinking.\n\nThere were times when she was almost sure of herself--Mrs. Hubert\nPlessington could scarcely have been surer of herself, and times when\nthe whole magnificent project of constructing a new urban social life\nout of those difficult hostels, a collective urban life that should be\nliberal and free, broke into grimacing pieces and was the most foolish\nof experiments. Her struggles with Mrs. Pembrose thereupon assumed a\nquality of mere bickering and she could even doubt whether Mrs. Pembrose\nwasn't justified in her attitude and wiser by her very want of\ngenerosity. She felt then something childish in the whole undertaking\nthat otherwise escaped her, she was convicted of an absurd\nself-importance, she discovered herself an ignorant woman availing\nherself of her husband's power and wealth to attempt presumptuous\nexperiments. In these moods of disillusionment, her mind went adrift and\nwas driven to and fro from discontent to discontent; she would find\nherself taking soundings and seeking an anchorage upon the strangest,\nmost unfamiliar shoals. And in her relations and conflicts with her\nhusband there was a smouldering shame for her submissions to him that\nneeded only a phase of fatigue to become acute. So long as she believed\nin her hostels and her mission that might be endured, but forced back\nupon her more personal life its hideousness stood unclothed. Mr. Brumley\ncould sometimes reassure her by a rhetorical effort upon the score of\nher hostels, but most of her more intimate and inner life was not, for\nvery plain reasons, to be shown to him. He was full of the intention of\ngenerous self-denials, but she had long since come to measure the limits\nof his self-denial....\n\nMr. Brumley was a friend in whom smouldered a love, capable she knew\nquite clearly of tormented and tormenting jealousies. It would be\ndifficult to tell, and she certainly could never have told how far she\nknew of this by instinct, how far it came out of rapid intuitions from\nthings seen and heard. But she understood that she dared not let a\nsingle breath of encouragement, a hint of physical confidence, reach\nthat banked-up glow. A sentinel discretion in her brain was always on\nthe watch for that danger, and that restraint, that added deliberate\ninexpressiveness, kept them most apart, when most her spirit cried out\nfor companionship.\n\nThe common quality of all these moods of lassitude was a desolating\nloneliness. She had at times a need that almost overwhelmed her to be\nintimate, to be comforted and taken up out of the bleak harsh\ndisappointments and stresses of her customary life. At times after Sir\nIsaac had either been too unloving or too loving, or when the girls or\nthe matrons had achieved some new tangle of mutual unreasonableness, or\nwhen her faith failed, she would lie in the darkness of her own room\nwith her soul crying out for--how can one put it?--the touch of other\nsoul-stuff. And perhaps it was the constant drift of Mr. Brumley's talk,\nthe little suggestions that fell drop by drop into her mind from his,\nthat disposed her to believe that this aching sense of solitude in the\nvoid was to be assuaged by love, by some marvel of close exaltation that\none might reach through a lover. She had told Mr. Brumley long ago that\nshe would never let herself think of love, she still maintained to him\nthat attitude of resolute aloofness, but almost without noting what she\ndid, she was tampering now in her solitude with the seals of that locked\nchamber. She became secretly curious about love. Perhaps there was\nsomething in it of which she knew nothing. She found herself drawn\ntowards poetry, found a new attraction in romance; more and more did she\ndally with the idea that there was some unknown beauty in the world,\nsomething to which her eyes might presently open, something deeper and\nsweeter than any thing she had ever known, close at hand, something to\nput all the world into proportion for her.\n\nIn a little while she no longer merely tampered with these seals, for\nquite silently the door had opened and she was craning in. This love it\nseemed to her might after all be so strange a thing that it goes\nunsuspected and yet fills the whole world of a human soul. An odd\ngrotesque passage in a novel by Wilkins gave her that idea. He compared\nlove to electricity, of all things in the world; that throbbing life\namidst the atoms that we now draw upon for light, warmth, connexion, the\nsatisfaction of a thousand wants and the cure of a thousand ills. There\nit is and always has been in the life of man, and yet until a century\nago it worked unsuspected, was known only for a disregarded oddity of\namber, a crackling in frost-dry hair and thunder....\n\nAnd then she remembered how Mr. Brumley had once broken into a panegyric\nof love. \"It makes life a different thing. It is like the home-coming of\nsomething lost. All this dispersed perplexing world _centres_. Think\nwhat true love means; to live always in the mind of another and to have\nthat other living always in your mind.... Only there can be no\nrestraints, no reserves, no admission of prior rights. One must feel\n_safe_ of one's welcome and freedoms....\"\n\nWasn't it worth the risk of almost any breach of boundaries to get to\nsuch a light as that?...\n\nShe hid these musings from every human being, she was so shy with them,\nshe hid them almost from herself. Rarely did they have their way with\nher and when they did, presently she would accuse herself of slackness\nand dismiss them and urge herself to fresh practicalities in her work.\nBut her work was not always at hand, Sir Isaac's frequent relapses took\nher abroad to places where she found herself in the midst of beautiful\nscenery with little to do and little to distract her from these\nquestionings. Then such thoughts would inundate her.\n\nThis feeling of the unsatisfactoriness of life, of incompleteness and\nsolitariness, was not of that fixed sort that definitely indicates its\ndemand. Under its oppression she tried the idea of love, but she also\ntried certain other ideas. Very often this vague appeal had the quality\nof a person, sometimes a person shrouded in night, a soundless whisper,\nthe unseen lover who came to Psyche in the darkness. And sometimes that\nperson became more distinct, less mystic and more companionable. Perhaps\nbecause imaginations have a way of following the line of least\nresistance, it took upon itself something of the form, something of the\nvoice and bearing of Mr. Brumley. She recoiled from her own thoughts\nwhen she discovered herself wondering what manner of lover Mr. Brumley\nmight make--if suddenly she lowered her defences, freed his suffocating\npleading, took him to herself.\n\nIn my anxiety to draw Mr. Brumley as he was, I have perhaps a little\nneglected to show him as Lady Harman saw him. We have employed the\ninconsiderate verisimilitude of a novelist repudiating romance in his\nportrayal; towards her he kept a better face. He was at least a very\nhonest lover and there was little disingenuousness in the flow of fine\nmental attitudes that met her; the thought and presence of her made him\nfine; as soon could he have turned his shady side towards the sun. And\nshe was very ready and eager to credit him with generous qualities. We\nof his club and circle, a little assisted perhaps by Max Beerbohm's\ndiabolical index finger, may have found and been not unwilling to find\nhis face chiefly expressive of a kind of empty alertness; but when it\nwas turned to her its quite pleasantly modelled features glowed and it\nwas transfigured. So far as she was concerned, with Sir Isaac as foil,\nhe was real enough and good enough for her. And by the virtue of that\nunlovely contrast even a certain ineffectiveness--became infinite\ndelicacy....\n\nThe thought of Mr. Brumley in that relation and to that extent of\nclearness came but rarely into her consciousness, and when it did it was\nalmost immediately dismissed again. It was the most fugitive of\nproffered consolations. And it is to be remarked that it made its most\nsuccessful apparitions when Mr. Brumley was far away, and by some weeks\nor months of separation a little blurred and forgotten....\n\nAnd sometimes this unrest of her spirit, this unhappiness turned her in\nquite another direction as it seemed and she had thoughts of religion.\nWith a deepened shame she would go seeking into that other, that greater\nindelicacy, from which her upbringing had divorced her mind. She would\neven secretly pray. Greatly daring she fled on several occasions from\nher visitation of the hostels or slipped out of her home, and evading\nMr. Brumley, went once to the Brompton Oratory, once or twice to the\nWestminster Cathedral and then having discovered Saint Paul's, to Saint\nPaul's in search of this nameless need. It was a need that no plain and\nugly little place of worship would satisfy. It was a need that demanded\nchoir and organ. She went to Saint Paul's haphazard when her mood and\nopportunity chanced together and there in the afternoons she found a\nwonder of great music and chanting voices, and she would kneel looking\nup into those divine shadows and perfect archings and feel for a time\nassuaged, wonderfully assuaged. Sometimes, there, she seemed to be upon\nthe very verge of grasping that hidden reality which makes all things\nplain. Sometimes it seemed to her that this very indulgence was the\nhidden reality.\n\nShe could never be sure in her mind whether these secret worshippings\nhelped or hampered her in her daily living. They helped her to a certain\ndisregard of annoyances and indignities and so far they were good, but\nthey also helped towards a more general indifference. She might have\ntold these last experiences to Mr. Brumley if she had not felt them to\nbe indescribable. They could not be half told. They had to be told\ncompletely or they were altogether untellable. So she had them hid, and\nat once accepted and distrusted the consolation they brought her, and\nwent on with the duties and philanthropies that she had chosen as her\ntask in the world.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a72\n\nOne day in Lent--it was nearly three years after the opening of the\nfirst hostel--she went to Saint Paul's.\n\nShe was in a mood of great discouragement; the struggle between Mrs.\nPembrose and the Bloomsbury girls had suddenly reopened in an acute form\nand Sir Isaac, who was sickening again after a period of better health,\nhad become strangely restless and irritable and hostile to her. He had\nthwarted her unusually and taken the side of the matrons in a conflict\nin which Susan Burnet's sister Alice was now distinguished as the chief\nof the malcontents. The new trouble seemed to Lady Harman to be\ntraceable in one direction to that ardent Unionist, Miss Babs Wheeler,\nunder the spell of whose round-faced, blue-eyed, distraught personality\nAlice had altogether fallen. Miss Babs Wheeler was fighting for the\nUnion; she herself lived at Highbury with her mother, and Alice was her\nchosen instrument in the hostels. The Union had always been a little\nagainst the lady-like instincts of many of the waitresses; they felt\nstrikes were vulgar and impaired their social standing, and this feeling\nhad been greatly strengthened by irruptions of large contingents of shop\nassistants from various department stores. The Bloomsbury Hostel in\nparticular now accommodated a hundred refined and elegant hands--they\nought rather to be called figures--from the great Oxford Street costume\nhouse of Eustace and Mills, young people with a tall sweeping movement\nand an elevation of chin that had become nearly instinctive, and a\nsilent yet evident intention to find the International girls \"low\" at\nthe slightest provocation. It is only too easy for poor humanity under\nthe irritation of that tacit superiority to respond with just the\nprovocation anticipated. What one must regretfully speak of as the\nvulgar section of the International girls had already put itself in the\nwrong by a number of aggressive acts before the case came to Lady\nHarman's attention. Mrs. Pembrose seized the occasion for weeding on a\ncourageous scale, and Miss Alice Burnet and three of her dearest friends\nwere invited to vacate their rooms \"pending redecoration\".\n\nWith only too much plausibility the threatened young women interpreted\nthis as an expulsion, and declined to remove their boxes and personal\nbelongings. Miss Babs Wheeler thereupon entered the Bloomsbury Hostel,\nand in the teeth of three express prohibitions from Mrs. Pembrose, went\na little up the staircase and addressed a confused meeting in the\ncentral hall. There was loud and continuous cheering for Lady Harman at\nintervals during this incident. Thereupon Mrs. Pembrose demanded\nsweeping dismissals, not only from the Hostels but the shops as an\nalternative to her resignation, and Lady Harman found herself more\nperplexed than ever....\n\nGeorgina Sawbridge had contrived to mingle herself in an entirely\ncharacteristic way in these troubles by listening for a brief period to\nan abstract of her sister's perplexities, then demanding to be made\nDirector-General of the whole affair, refusing to believe this simple\nstep impossible and retiring in great dudgeon to begin a series of\nletters of even more than sisterly bitterness. And Mr. Brumley when\nconsulted had become dangerously sentimental. Under these circumstances\nLady Harman's visit to Saint Paul's had much of the quality of a flight.\n\nIt was with an unwonted sense of refuge that she came from the sombre\nstress and roar of London without into the large hushed spaces of the\ncathedral. The door closed behind her--and all things changed. Here was\nmeaning, coherence, unity. Here instead of a pelting confusion of\nmovements and motives was a quiet concentration upon the little focus of\nlight about the choir, the gentle complete dominance of a voice\nintoning. She slipped along the aisle and into the nave and made her way\nto a seat. How good this was! Outside she had felt large, awkwardly\nresponsible, accessible to missiles, a distressed conspicuous thing;\nwithin this living peace she suddenly became no more than one of a\ntranquil hushed community of small black-clad Lenten people; she found a\nchair and knelt and felt she vanished even from her own\nconsciousness....\n\nHow beautiful was this place! She looked up presently at the great\nshadowy arcs far above her, so easy, so gracious that it seemed they had\nnot so much been built by men as shaped by circling flights of angels.\nThe service, a little clustering advance of voices unsustained by any\norgan, mingled in her mind with the many-pointed glow of candles. And\nthen into this great dome of worship and beauty, like a bed of voices\nbreaking into flower, like a springtime breeze of sound, came Allegri's\nMiserere....\n\nHer spirit clung to this mood of refuge. It seemed as though the\ndisorderly, pugnacious, misunderstanding universe had opened and shown\nher luminous mysteries. She had a sense of penetration. All that\nconflict, that jar of purposes and motives, was merely superficial; she\nhad left it behind her. For a time she had no sense of effort in keeping\nhold of this, only of attainment, she drifted happily upon the sweet\nsustaining sounds, and then--then the music ceased. She came back into\nherself. Close to her a seated man stirred and sighed. She tried to get\nback her hold upon that revelation but it had gone. Inexorably, opaque,\nimpenetrable doors closed softly on her moment of vision....\n\nAll about her was the stir of departure.\n\nShe walked out slowly into the cold March daylight, to the leaden greys,\nthe hurrying black shapes, the chaotic afternoon traffic of London. She\npaused on the steps, still but half reawakened. A passing omnibus\nobtruded the familiar inscription, \"International Stores for Staminal\nBread.\"\n\nShe turned like one who remembers, to where her chauffeur stood waiting.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a73\n\nAs her motor car, with a swift smoothness, carried her along the\nEmbankment towards the lattice bar of Charing Cross bridge and the\nremoter towers of the Houses of Parliament, grey now and unsubstantial\nagainst the bright western sky, her mind came back slowly to her\nparticular issues in life. But they were no longer the big\nexasperatingly important things that had seemed to hold her life by a\nhundred painful hooks before she went into the cathedral. They were\nsmall still under this dome of evening, small even by the measure of the\ngrey buildings to the right of her and the warm lit river to her left,\nby the measure of the clustering dark barges, the teeming trams, the\nstreaming crowds of people, the note of the human process that sounds so\nloud there. She felt small even to herself, for the touch of beauty\nsaves us from our own personalities, makes Gods of us to our own\nlittleness. She passed under the railway bridge at Charing Cross,\nwatched the square cluster of Westminster's pinnacles rise above her\nuntil they were out of sight overhead, ran up the little incline and\nround into Parliament Square, and was presently out on the riverside\nembankment again with the great chimneys of Chelsea smoking athwart the\nevening gold. And thence with a sudden effect of skies shut and curtains\ndrawn she came by devious ways to the Fulham Road and the crowding\ntraffic of Putney Bridge and Putney High Street and so home.\n\nSnagsby, assisted by a new under-butler, a lean white-faced young man\nwith red hair, received her ceremoniously and hovered serviceably about\nher. On the hall table lay three or four visiting cards of no\nimportance, some circulars and two letters. She threw the circulars\ninto the basket placed for them and opened her first letter. It was from\nGeorgina; it was on several sheets and it began, \"I still cannot believe\nthat you refuse to give me the opportunity the director-generalship of\nyour hostels means to me. It is not as if you yourself had either the\ntime or the abilities necessary for them yourself; you haven't, and\nthere is something almost dog-in-the-manger-ish to my mind in the way in\nwhich you will not give me my chance, the chance I have always been\nlonging for----\"\n\nAt this point Lady Harman put down this letter for subsequent perusal\nand took its companion, which was addressed in an unfamiliar hand. It\nwas from Alice Burnet and it was written in that sprawling hand and\ndiffused style natural to a not very well educated person with a\ncomplicated story to tell in a state of unusual emotion. But the gist\nwas in the first few sentences which announced that Alice had been\nevicted from the hostel. \"I found my things on the pavement,\" wrote\nAlice.\n\nLady Harman became aware of Snagsby still hovering at hand.\n\n\"Mrs. Pembrose, my lady, came here this afternoon,\" he said, when he had\nsecured her attention.\n\n\"Came here.\"\n\n\"She asked for you, my lady, and when I told her you were not at 'ome,\nshe asked if she might see Sir Isaac.\"\n\n\"And did she?\"\n\n\"Sir Isaac saw her, my lady. They 'ad tea in the study.\"\n\n\"I wish I had been at home to see her,\" said Lady Harman, after a brief\ninterval of reflection.\n\nShe took her two letters and turned to the staircase. They were still in\nher hand when presently she came into her husband's study. \"I don't want\na light,\" he said, as she put out her hand to the electric switch. His\nvoice had a note of discontent, but he was sitting in the armchair\nagainst the window so that she could not see his features.\n\n\"How are you feeling this afternoon?\" she asked.\n\n\"I'm feeling all right,\" he answered testily. He seemed to dislike\ninquiries after his health almost as much as he disliked neglect.\n\nShe came and stood by him and looked out from the dusk of the room into\nthe garden darkening under a red-barred sky. \"There is fresh trouble\nbetween Mrs. Pembrose and the girls,\" she said.\n\n\"She's been telling me about it.\"\n\n\"She's been here?\"\n\n\"Pretty nearly an hour,\" said Sir Isaac.\n\nLady Harman tried to imagine that hour's interview on the spur of the\nmoment and failed. She came to her immediate business. \"I think,\" she\nsaid, \"that she has been--high-handed....\"\n\n\"You would,\" said Sir Isaac after an interval.\n\nHis tone was hostile, so hostile that it startled her.\n\n\"Don't you?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"My idees and your idees--or anyhow the idees you've\ngot hold of--somewhere--somehow----I don't know where you _get_ your\nidees. We haven't got the same idees, anyhow. You got to keep order in\nthese places--anyhow....\"\n\nShe perceived that she was in face of a prepared position. \"I don't\nthink,\" she threw out, \"that she does keep order. She represses--and\nirritates. She gets an idea that certain girls are against her....\"\n\n\"And you get an idea she's against certain girls....\"\n\n\"Practically she expels them. She has in fact just turned one out into\nthe street.\"\n\n\"You got to expel 'em. You got to. You can't run these places on sugar\nand water. There's a sort of girl, a sort of man, who makes trouble.\nThere's a sort makes strikes, makes mischief, gets up grievances. You\ngot to get rid of 'em somehow. You got to be practical somewhere. You\ncan't go running these places on a lot of littry idees and all that.\nIt's no good.\"\n\nThe phrase \"littry idees\" held Lady Harman's attention for a moment. But\nshe could not follow it up to its implications, because she wanted to\nget on with the issue she had in hand.\n\n\"I want to be consulted about these expulsions. Girl after girl has been\nsent away----\"\n\nSir Isaac's silhouette was obstinate.\n\n\"She knows her business,\" he said.\n\nHe seemed to feel the need of a justification. \"They shouldn't make\ntrouble.\"\n\nOn that they rested for a little while in silence. She began to realize\nwith a gathering emotion that this matter was far more crucial than she\nhad supposed. She had been thinking only of the reinstatement of Alice\nBurnet, she hadn't yet estimated just what that overriding of Mrs.\nPembrose might involve.\n\n\"I don't want to have any girl go until I have looked into her case.\nIt's----It's vital.\"\n\n\"She says she can't run the show unless she has some power.\"\n\nNeither spoke for some seconds. She had the feeling of hopeless vexation\nthat might come to a child that has wandered into a trap. \"I thought,\"\nshe began. \"These hostels----\"\n\nShe stopped short.\n\nSir Isaac's hand tightened on the arm of his chair. \"I started 'em to\nplease you,\" he said. \"I didn't start 'em to please your friends.\"\n\nShe turned her eyes quickly to his grey up-looking face.\n\n\"I didn't start them for you and that chap Brumley to play about with,\"\nhe amplified. \"And now you know about it, Elly.\"\n\nThe thing had found her unprepared. \"As if----\" she said at last.\n\n\"As if!\" he mocked.\n\nShe stood quite still staring blankly at this unmanageable situation. He\nwas the first to break silence. He lifted one hand and dropped it again\nwith a dead impact on the arm of his chair. \"I got the things,\" he said,\n\"and there they are. Anyhow,--they got to be run in a proper way.\"\n\nShe made no immediate answer. She was seeking desperately for phrases\nthat escaped her. \"Do you think,\" she began at last. \"Do you really\nthink----?\"\n\nHe stared out of the window. He answered in tones of excessive\nreasonableness: \"I didn't start these hostels to be run by you and\nyour--friend.\" He gave the sentence the quality of an ultimatum, an\nirreducible minimum.\n\n\"He's my friend,\" she explained, \"only--because he does work--for the\nhostels.\"\n\nSir Isaac seemed for a moment to attempt to consider that. Then he\nrelapsed upon his predetermined attitude. \"God!\" he exclaimed, \"but I\nhave been a fool!\"\n\nShe decided that that must be ignored.\n\n\"I care more for those hostels than I care for anything--anything else\nin the world,\" she told him. \"I want them to work--I want them to\nsucceed.... And then----\"\n\nHe listened in sceptical silence.\n\n\"Mr. Brumley is nothing to me but a helper. He----How can you imagine,\nIsaac----? _I!_ How can you dare? To suggest----!\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Sir Isaac and reflected and made his old familiar\nsound with his teeth. \"Run the hostels without him, Elly,\" he\npropounded. \"Then I'll believe.\"\n\nShe perceived that suddenly she was faced by a test or a bargain. In the\nbackground of her mind the figure of Mr. Brumley, as she had seen him\nlast, in brown and with a tie rather to one side, protested vainly. She\ndid what she could for him on the spur of the moment. \"But,\" she said,\n\"he's so helpful. He's so--harmless.\"\n\n\"That's as may be,\" said Sir Isaac and breathed heavily.\n\n\"How can one suddenly turn on a friend?\"\n\n\"I don't see that you ever wanted a friend,\" said Sir Isaac.\n\n\"He's been so good. It isn't reasonable, Isaac. When anyone\nhas--_slaved_.\"\n\n\"I don't say he isn't a good sort of chap,\" said Sir Isaac, with that\nsame note of almost superhuman rationality, \"only--he isn't going to run\nmy hostels.\"\n\n\"But what do you mean, Isaac?\"\n\n\"I mean you got to choose.\"\n\nHe waited as if he expected her to speak and then went on.\n\n\"What it comes to is this, Elly, I'm about sick of that chap. I'm sick\nof him.\" He paused for a moment because his breath was short. \"If you go\non with the hostels he's--Phew--got to mizzle. _Then_--I don't mind--if\nyou want that girl Burnet brought back in triumph.... It'll make Mrs.\nPembrose chuck the whole blessed show, you know, but I say--I don't\nmind.... Only in that case, I don't want to see or hear--or hear\nabout--Phew--or hear about your Mr. Brumley again. And I don't want you\nto, either.... I'm being pretty reasonable and pretty patient over this,\nwith people--people--talking right and left. Still,--there's a limit....\nYou've been going on--if I didn't know you were an innocent--in a way\n... I don't want to talk about that. There you are, Elly.\"\n\nIt seemed to her that she had always expected this to happen. But\nhowever much she had expected it to happen she was still quite\nunprepared with any course of action. She wanted with an equal want of\nlimitation to keep both Mr. Brumley and her hostels.\n\n\"But Isaac,\" she said. \"What do you suspect? What do you think? This\nfriendship has been going on----How can I end it suddenly?\"\n\n\"Don't you be too innocent, Elly. You know and I know perfectly well\nwhat there is between men and women. I don't make out I know--anything I\ndon't know. I don't pretend you are anything but straight. Only----\"\n\nHe suddenly gave way to his irritation. His self-control vanished. \"Damn\nit!\" he cried, and his panting breath quickened; \"the thing's got to\nend. As if I didn't understand! As if I didn't understand!\"\n\nShe would have protested again but his voice held her. \"It's got to end.\nIt's got to end. Of course you haven't done anything, of course you\ndon't know anything or think of anything.... Only here I am ill....\n_You_ wouldn't be sorry if I got worse.... _You_ can wait; you can....\nAll right! All right! And there you stand, irritating me--arguing. You\nknow--it chokes me.... Got to end, I tell you.... Got to end....\"\n\nHe beat at the arms of his chair and then put a hand to his throat.\n\n\"Go away,\" he cried to her. \"Go to hell!\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a74\n\nI cannot tell whether the reader is a person of swift decisions or one\nof the newer race of doubters; if he be the latter he will the better\nunderstand how Lady Harman did in the next two days make up her mind\ndefinitely and conclusively to two entirely opposed lines of action. She\ndecided that her relations with Mr. Brumley, innocent as they were, must\ncease in the interests of the hostels and her struggle with Mrs.\nPembrose, and she decided with quite equal certainty that her husband's\nsudden veto upon these relations was an intolerable tyranny that must be\nresisted with passionate indignation. Also she was surprised to find how\ndifficult it was now to think of parting from Mr. Brumley. She made her\nway to these precarious conclusions and on from whichever it was to the\nother through a jungle of conflicting considerations and feelings. When\nshe thought of Mrs. Pembrose and more particularly of the probable share\nof Mrs. Pembrose in her husband's objection to Mr. Brumley her\nindignation kindled. She perceived Mrs. Pembrose as a purely evil\npersonality, as a spirit of espionage, distrust, calculated treachery\nand malignant intervention, as all that is evil in rule and officialism,\nand a vast wave of responsibility for all those difficult and feeble and\nlikeable young women who elbowed and giggled and misunderstood and\nblundered and tried to live happily under the commanding stresses of\nMrs. Pembrose's austerity carried her away. She had her duty to do to\nthem and it overrode every other duty. If a certain separation from Mr.\nBrumley's assiduous aid was demanded, was it too great a sacrifice? And\nno sooner was that settled than the whole question reopened with her\nindignant demand why anyone at any price had the right to prohibit a\nfriendship that she had so conscientiously kept innocent. If she gave\nway to this outrageous restriction to-day, what fresh limitations might\nnot Sir Isaac impose to-morrow? And now, she was so embarrassed in her\nstruggle by his health. She could not go to him and have things out with\nhim, she could not directly defy him, because that might mean a\nsuffocating seizure for him....\n\nIt was entirely illogical, no doubt, but extremely natural for Lady\nHarman to decide that she must communicate her decision, whichever one\nit was, to Mr. Brumley in a personal interview. She wrote to him and\narranged to meet and talk to him in Kew Gardens, and with a feeling of\ndiscretion went thither not in the automobile but in a taxi-cab. And so\ndelicately now were her two irrevocable decisions balanced in her mind\nthat twice on her way to Kew she swayed over from one to the other.\n\nArrived at the gardens she found herself quite disinclined to begin the\nannouncement of either decision. She was quite exceptionally glad to see\nMr. Brumley; he was dressed in a new suit of lighter brown that became\nhim very well indeed, the day was warm and bright, a day of scyllas and\ndaffodils and snow-upon-the-mountains and green-powdered trees and frank\nsunshine,--and the warmth of her feelings for her friend merged\nindistinguishably with the springtime stir and glow. They walked across\nthe bright turf together in a state of unjustifiable happiness, purring\nlittle admirations at the ingenious elegance of creation at its best as\ngardeners set it out for our edification, and the whole tenor of Lady\nHarman's mind was to make this occasion an escape from the particular\nbusiness that had brought her thither.\n\n\"We'll look for daffodils away there towards the river under the trees,\"\nsaid Mr. Brumley, and it seemed preposterous not to enjoy those\ndaffodils at least before she broached the great issue between an\nirresistible force and an immoveable post, that occupied her mental\nbackground.\n\nMr. Brumley was quite at his best that afternoon. He was happy, gay and\ndeferential; he made her realize by his every tone and movement that if\nhe had his choice of the whole world that afternoon and all its\ninhabitants and everything, there was no other place in which he would\nbe, no other companion, no other occupation than this he had. He talked\nof spring and flowers, quoted poets and added the treasures of a\nwell-stored mind to the amenities of the day. \"It's good to take a\nholiday at times,\" he said, and after that it was more difficult than\never to talk about the trouble of the hostels.\n\nShe was able to do this at last while they were having tea in the little\npavilion near the pagoda. It was the old pavilion, the one that Miss\nAlimony's suffragettes were afterwards to burn down in order to\ndemonstrate the relentless logic of women. They did it in the same\neventful week when Miss Alimony was, she declared, so nearly carried off\nby White Slave Traders (disguised as nurses but, fortunately for her,\nsmelling of brandy) from the Brixton Temperance Bazaar. But in those\nsimpler days the pavilion still existed; it was tended by agreeable\nwaiters whose evening dress was mitigated by cheerful little straw hats,\nand an enormous multitude of valiant and smutty Cockney sparrows chirped\nand squeaked and begged and fluttered and fought, venturing to the very\ntables and feet of the visitors. And here, a little sobered from their\nfirst elation by much walking about and the presence of jam and\nwatercress, Mr. Brumley and Lady Harman could think again of the work\nthey were doing for the reconstitution of society upon collective lines.\n\nShe began to tell him of the conflict between Mrs. Pembrose and Alice\nBurnet that threatened the latter with extinction. She found it more\nconvenient to talk at first as though the strands of decision were still\nall in her hands; afterwards she could go on to the peculiar\ncomplication of the situation through the unexpected weakening of her\nposition in relation to Mrs. Pembrose. She described the particular of\nthe new trouble, the perplexing issue between the \"lady-like,\" for which\nas a feminine ideal there was so much to be said on the one hand and\nthe \"genial,\" which was also an admirable quality, on the other. \"You\nsee,\" she said, \"it's very rude to cough at people and make noises, but\nthen it's so difficult to explain to the others that it's equally rude\nto go past people and pretend not to see or hear them. Girls of that\nsort always seem so much more underbred when they are trying to be\nsuperior than when they are not; they get so stiff and--exasperating.\nAnd this keeping out of the Union because it isn't genteel, it's the\nvery essence of the trouble with all these employees. We've discussed\nthat so often. Those drapers' girls seem full of such cold, selfish,\nbase, pretentious notions; much more full even than our refreshment\ngirls. And then as if it wasn't all difficult enough comes Mrs. Pembrose\nand her wardresses doing all sorts of hard, clumsy things, and one can't\ntell them just how little they are qualified to judge good behaviour.\nTheir one idea of discipline is to speak to people as if they were\nservants and to be distant and crushing. And long before one can do\nanything come trouble and tart replies and reports of \"gross\nimpertinence\" and expulsion. We keep on expelling girls. This is the\nfourth time girls have had to go. What is to become of them? I know this\nBurnet girl quite well as you know. She's just a human, kindly little\nwoman.... She'll feel disgraced.... How can I let a thing like that\noccur?\"\n\nShe spread her hands apart over the tea things.\n\nMr. Brumley held his chin in his hand and said \"Um\" and looked judicial,\nand admired Lady Harman very much, and tried to grasp the whole trouble\nand wring out a solution. He made some admirable generalizations about\nthe development of a new social feeling in response to changed\nconditions, but apart from a remark that Mrs. Pembrose was all\norganization and no psychology, and quite the wrong person for her\nposition, he said nothing in the slightest degree contributory to the\nparticular drama under consideration. From that utterance, however, Lady\nHarman would no doubt have gone on to the slow, tentative but finally\nconclusive statement of the new difficulty that had arisen out of her\nhusband's jealousy and to the discussion of the more fundamental\ndecisions it forced upon her, if a peculiar blight had not fallen upon\ntheir conversation and robbed it at last of even an appearance of ease.\n\nThis blight crept upon their minds.... It began first with Mr. Brumley.\n\nMr. Brumley was rarely free from self-consciousness. Whenever he was in\na restaurant or any such place of assembly, then whatever he did or\nwhatever he said he had a kind of surplus attention, a quickening of the\nears, a wandering of the eyes, to the groups and individuals round about\nhim. And while he had seemed entirely occupied with Lady Harman, he had\nnevertheless been aware from the outset that a dingy and\ninappropriate-looking man in a bowler hat and a ready-made suit of grey,\nwas listening to their conversation from an adjacent table.\n\nThis man had entered the pavilion oddly. He had seemed to dodge in and\nhesitate. Then he had chosen his table rather deliberately--and he kept\nlooking, and trying not to seem to look.\n\nThat was not all. Mr. Brumley's expression was overcast by the effort to\nrecall something. He sat elbows on table and leant forward towards Lady\nHarman and at the blossom-laden trees outside the pavilion and trifled\nwith two fingers on his lips and spoke between them in a voice that was\nspeculative and confidential and muffled and mysterious. \"Where have I\nseen our friend to the left before?\"\n\nShe had been aware of his distraction for some time.\n\nShe glanced at the man and found nothing remarkable in him. She tried to\ngo on with her explanations.\n\nMr. Brumley appeared attentive and then he said again: \"But where have I\nseen him?\"\n\nAnd from that point their talk was blighted; the heart seemed to go out\nof her. Mr. Brumley she felt was no longer taking in what she was\nsaying. At the time she couldn't in any way share his preoccupation. But\nwhat had been difficult before became hopeless and she could no longer\nfeel that even presently she would be able to make him understand the\npeculiar alternatives before her. They drifted back by the great\nconservatory and the ornamental water, aripple with ducks and swans, to\nthe gates where his taxi waited.\n\nEven then it occurred to her that she ought to tell him something of the\nnew situation. But now their time was running out, she would have to be\nconcise, and what wife could ever say abruptly and offhand that\nfrequent fact, \"Oh, by the by, my husband is jealous of you\"? Then she\nhad an impulse to tell him simply, without any explanation at all, that\nfor a time he must not meet her. And while she gathered herself together\nfor that, his preoccupations intervened again.\n\nHe stood up in the open taxi-cab and looked back.\n\n\"That chap,\" he said, \"is following us.\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a75\n\nThe effect of this futile interview upon Lady Harman was remarkable. She\ntook to herself an absurd conviction that this inconclusiveness had been\nan achievement. Confronted by a dilemma, she had chosen neither horn and\nassumed an attitude of inoffensive defiance. Springs in England vary\ngreatly in their character; some are easterly and quarrelsome, some are\nnorth-westerly and wetly disastrous, a bleak invasion from the ocean;\nsome are but the broken beginnings of what are not so much years as\nstretches of meteorological indecision. This particular spring was\nessentially a south-westerly spring, good and friendly, showery but in\nthe lightest way and so softly reassuring as to be gently hilarious. It\nwas a spring to get into the blood of anyone; it gave Lady Harman the\nfeeling that Mrs. Pembrose would certainly be dealt with properly and\nwithout unreasonable delay by Heaven, and that meanwhile it was well to\ntake the good things of existence as cheerfully as possible. The good\nthings she took were very innocent things. Feeling unusually well and\nenjoying great draughts of spring air and sunshine were the chief. And\nshe took them only for three brief days. She carried the children down\nto Black Strand to see her daffodils, and her daffodils surpassed\nexpectation. There was a delirium of blackthorn in the new wild garden\nshe had annexed from the woods and a close carpet of encouraged wild\nprimroses. Even the Putney garden was full of happy surprises. The\nafternoon following her visit to Black Strand was so warm that she had\ntea with her family in great gaiety on the lawn under the cedar. Her\noffspring were unusually sweet that day, they had new blue cotton\nsunbonnets, and Baby and Annette at least succeeded in being pretty. And\nMillicent, under the new Swiss governess, had acquired, it seemed quite\nsuddenly, a glib colloquial French that somehow reconciled one to the\nextreme thinness and shapelessness of her legs.\n\nThen an amazing new fact broke into this gleam of irrational\ncontentment, a shattering new fact. She found she was being watched. She\ndiscovered that dingy man in the grey suit following her.\n\nThe thing came upon her one afternoon. She was starting out for a talk\nwith Georgina. She felt so well, so confident of the world that it was\nintolerable to think of Georgina harbouring resentment; she resolved she\nwould go and have things out with her and make it clear just how\nimpossible it was to impose a Director-General upon her husband. She\nbecame aware of the man in grey as she walked down Putney Hill.\n\nShe recognized him at once. He was at the corner of Redfern Road and\nstill unaware of her existence. He was leaning against the wall with the\nhabituated pose of one who is frequently obliged to lean against walls\nfor long periods of time, and he was conversing in an elucidatory manner\nwith the elderly crossing-sweeper who still braves the motor-cars at\nthat point. He became aware of her emergence with a start, he ceased to\nlean and became observant.\n\nHe was one of those men whose face suggests the word \"muzzle,\" with an\nerect combative nose and a forward slant of the body from the rather\ninturned feet. He wore an observant bowler hat a little too small for\nhim, and there is something about the tail of his jacket--as though he\nhad been docked.\n\nShe passed at a stride to the acceptance of Mr. Brumley's hitherto\nincredible suspicion. Her pulses quickened. It came into her head to see\nhow far this man would go in following her. She went on demurely down\nthe hill leaving him quite unaware that she had seen him.\n\nShe was amazed, and after her first belief incredulous again. Could\nIsaac be going mad? At the corner she satisfied herself of the grey\nman's proximity and hailed a taxi-cab. The man in grey came nosing\nacross to listen to her directions and hear where she was going.\n\n\"Please drive up the hill until I tell you,\" she said, \"slowly\"--and had\nthe satisfaction, if one may call it a satisfaction, of seeing the grey\nman dive towards the taxi-cab rank. Then she gave herself up to hasty\nscheming.\n\nShe turned her taxi-cab abruptly when she was certain of being followed,\nwent back into London, turned again and made for Westridge's great\nstores in Oxford Street. The grey man ticked up two pences in pursuit.\nAll along the Brompton Road he pursued her with his nose like the jib of\na ship.\n\nShe was excited and interested, and not nearly so shocked as she ought\nto have been. It didn't somehow jar as it ought to have jarred with her\nidea of Sir Isaac. Watched by a detective! This then was the completion\nof the conditional freedom she had won by smashing that window. She\nmight have known....\n\nShe was astonished and indignant but not nearly so entirely indignant as\na noble heroine should have been. She was certainly not nearly so\nqueenly as Mrs. Sawbridge would have shown herself under such\ncircumstances. It may have been due to some plebeian strain in her\nfather's blood that over and above her proper indignation she was\nextremely interested. She wanted to know what manner of man it was whose\nnose was just appearing above the window edge of the taxi-cab behind. In\nher inexperienced inattention she had never yet thought it was possible\nthat men could be hired to follow women.\n\nShe sat a little forward, thinking.\n\nHow far would he follow her and was it possible to shake him off? Or are\nsuch followers so expert that once upon a scent, they are like the\nIndian hunting dog, inevitable. She must see.\n\nShe paid off her taxi at Westridge's and, with the skill of her sex,\nobserved him by the window reflection, counting the many doors of the\nestablishment. Would he try to watch them all? There were also some\nround the corner. No, he was going to follow her in. She had a sudden\ndesire, an unreasonable desire, perhaps an instinctive desire to see\nthat man among baby-linen. It was in her power for a time to wreathe him\nwith incongruous objects. This was the sort of fancy a woman must\ncontrol....\n\nHe stalked her with an unreal sang-froid. He ambushed behind a display\nof infants' socks. Driven to buy by a saleswoman he appeared to be\ndemanding improbable varieties of infant's socks.\n\nAre these watchers and trackers sometimes driven to buying things in\nshops? If so, strange items must figure in accounts of expenses. If he\nbought those socks, would they appear in Sir Isaac's bill? She felt a\nsudden craving for the sight of Sir Isaac's Private Detective Account.\nAnd as for the articles themselves, what became of them? She knew her\nhusband well enough to feel sure that if he paid for anything he would\ninsist upon having it. But where--where did he keep them?...\n\nBut now the man's back was turned; he was no doubt improvising paternity\nand an extreme fastidiousness in baby's footwear----Now for it!--through\ndepartments of deepening indelicacy to the lift!\n\nBut he had considered that possibility of embarrassment; he got round by\nsome other way, he was just in time to hear the lift gate clash upon a\ncalmly preoccupied lady, who still seemed as unaware of his existence\nas the sky.\n\nHe was running upstairs, when she descended again, without getting out;\nhe stopped at the sight of her shooting past him, their eyes met and\nthere was something appealing in his. He was very moist and his bowler\nwas flagging. He had evidently started out in the morning with\nmisconceptions about the weather. And it was clear he felt he had\nblundered in coming into Westridge's. Before she could get a taxi he was\non the pavement behind her, hot but pursuing.\n\nShe sought in her mind for corner shops, with doors on this street and\nthat. She exercised him upon Peter Robinson's and Debenham and\nFreebody's and then started for the monument. But on her way to the\nmonument she thought of the moving staircase at Harrod's. If she went up\nand down on this, she wanted to know what he would do, would he run up\nand down the fixed flight? He did. Several times. And then she bethought\nherself of the Piccadilly tube; she got in at Brompton road and got out\nat Down Street and then got in again and went to South Kensington and he\ndarted in and out of adjacent carriages and got into lifts by curious\nretrograde movements, being apparently under the erroneous impression\nthat his back was less characteristic than his face.\n\nBy this time he was evidently no longer unaware of her intelligent\ninterest in his movements. It was clear too that he had received a false\nimpression that she wanted to shake him off and that all the sleuth in\nhim was aroused. He was dishevelled and breathing hard and getting a\nlittle close and coarse in his pursuit, but he was sticking to it with a\npuckered intensified resolution. He came up into the South Kensington\nair open-mouthed and sniffing curiously, but invincible.\n\nShe discovered suddenly that she did not like him at all and that she\nwanted to go home.\n\nShe took a taxi, and then away in the wilds of the Fulham Road she had\nher crowning idea. She stopped the cab at a dingy little furniture shop,\npaid the driver exorbitantly and instructed him to go right back to\nSouth Kensington station, buy her an evening paper and return for her.\nThe pursuer drew up thirty yards away, fell into her trap, paid off his\ncab and feigned to be interested by a small window full of penny toys,\ncheap chocolate and cocoanut ice. She bought herself a brass door\nweight, paid for it hastily and posted herself just within the\nfurniture-shop door.\n\nThen you see her cab returned suddenly and she got in at once and left\nhim stranded.\n\nHe made a desperate effort to get a motor omnibus. She saw him rushing\nacross the traffic gesticulating. Then he collided with a boy with a\nbasket on a bicycle--not so far as she could see injuriously, they\nseemed to leap at once into a crowd and an argument, and then he was\nhidden from her by a bend in the road.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a76\n\nFor a little while her mind was full of fragments of speculation about\nthis man. Was he a married man? Was he very much away from home? What\ndid he earn? Were there ever disputes about his expenses?...\n\nShe must ask Isaac. For she was determined to go home and challenge her\nhusband. She felt buoyed up by indignation and the consciousness of\ninnocence....\n\nAnd then she felt an odd little doubt whether her innocence was quite so\nmanifest as she supposed?\n\nThat doubt grew to uncomfortable proportions.\n\nFor two years she had been meeting Mr. Brumley as confidently as though\nthey had been invisible beings, and now she had to rack her brains for\njust what might be mistaken, what might be misconstrued. There was\nnothing, she told herself, nothing, it was all as open as the day, and\nstill her mind groped about for some forgotten circumstance, something\ngone almost out of memory that would bear misinterpretation.... How\nshould she begin? \"Isaac,\" she would say, \"I am being followed about\nLondon.\" Suppose he denied his complicity! How could he deny his\ncomplicity?\n\nThe cab ran in through the gates of her home and stopped at the door.\nSnagsby came hurrying down the steps with a face of consternation. \"Sir\nIsaac, my lady, has come home in a very sad state indeed.\"\n\nBeyond Snagsby in the hall she came upon a lost-looking round-eyed\nFlorence.\n\n\"Daddy's ill again,\" said Florence.\n\n\"You run to the nursery,\" said Lady Harman.\n\n\"I thought I might help,\" said Florence. \"I don't want to play with the\nothers.\"\n\n\"No, run away to the nursery.\"\n\n\"I want to see the ossygen let out,\" said Florence petulantly to her\nmother's unsympathetic back. \"I _never_ see the ossygen let out.\nMum--my!...\"\n\nLady Harman found her husband on the couch in his bedroom. He was\npropped up in a sitting position with every available cushion and\npillow. His coat and waistcoat and collar had been taken off, and his\nshirt and vest torn open. The nearest doctor, Almsworth, was in\nattendance, but oxygen had not arrived, and Sir Isaac with an expression\nof bitter malignity upon his face was fighting desperately for breath.\nIf anything his malignity deepened at the sight of his wife. \"Damned\nclimate,\" he gasped. \"Wouldn't have come back--except for _your_\nfoolery.\"\n\nIt seemed to help him to say that. He took a deep inhalation, pressed\nhis lips tightly together, and nodded at her to confirm his words.\n\n\"If he's fanciful,\" said Almsworth. \"If in any way your presence\nirritates him----\"\n\n\"Let her stay,\" said Sir Isaac. \"It--pleases her....\"\n\nAlmsworth's colleague entered with the long-desired oxygen cylinder.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a77\n\nAnd now every other interest in life was dominated, and every other\nissue postponed by the immense urgencies of Sir Isaac's illness. It had\nentered upon a new phase. It was manifest that he could no longer live\nin England, that he must go to some warm and kindly climate. There and\nwith due precautions and observances Almsworth assured Lady Harman he\nmight survive for many years--\"an invalid, of course, but a capable\none.\"\n\nFor some time the business of the International Stores had been\npreparing itself for this withdrawal. Sir Isaac had been entrusting his\nmanagers with increased responsibility and making things ready for the\nflotation of a company that would take the whole network of enterprises\noff his hands. Charterson was associated with him in this, and\neverything was sufficiently definite to be managed from any continental\nresort to which his doctors chose to send him. They chose to send him to\nSanta Margherita on the Ligurian coast near Rapallo and Porto Fino.\n\nIt was old Bergener of Marienbad who chose this place. Sir Isaac had\nwanted to go to Marienbad, his first resort abroad; he had a lively and\nindeed an exaggerated memory of his Kur there; his growing disposition\nto distrust had turned him against his London specialist, and he had\ncaused Lady Harman to send gigantic telegrams of inquiry to old Bergener\nbefore he would be content. But Bergener would not have him at\nMarienbad; it wasn't the place, it was the wrong time of year, there\nwas the very thing for them at the Regency Hotel at Santa Margherita, an\nentire d\u00c3\u00a9pendance in a beautiful garden right on the sea, admirably\nfurnished and adapted in every way to Sir Isaac's peculiar needs. There,\ndeclared Doctor Bergener, with a proper attendant, due precaution,\noccasional oxygen and no excitement he would live indefinitely, that is\nto say eight or ten years. And attracted by the eight or ten years,\nwhich was three more than the London specialist offered, Sir Isaac\nfinally gave in and consented to be taken to Santa Margherita.\n\nHe was to go as soon as possible, and he went in a special train and\nwith an immense elaboration of attendance and comforts. They took with\nthem a young doctor their specialist at Marienbad had recommended, a\nbright young Bavarian with a perfectly square blond head, an incurable\nfrock coat, the manners of the less kindly type of hotel-porter and\nluggage which apparently consisted entirely of apparatus, an arsenal of\nstrange-shaped shining black cases. He joined them in London and went\nright through with them. From Genoa at his request they obtained the\nservices of a trained nurse, an amiable fluent-shaped woman who knew\nonly Italian and German. For reasons that he declined to give, but which\napparently had something to do with the suffrage agitation, he would\nhave nothing to do with an English trained nurse. They had also a\nstenographer and typist for Sir Isaac's correspondence, and Lady Harman\nhad a secretary, a young lady with glasses named Summersly Satchell who\nobviously reserved opinions of a harshly intellectual kind and had\npreviously been in the service of the late Lady Mary Justin. She\nestablished unfriendly relations with the young doctor at an early date\nby attempting, he said, to learn German from him. Then there was a maid\nfor Lady Harman, an assistant maid, and a valet-attendant for Sir Isaac.\nThe rest of the service in the d\u00c3\u00a9pendance was supplied by the hotel\nmanagement.\n\nIt took some weeks to assemble this expedition and transport it to its\nplace of exile. Arrangements had to be made for closing the Putney house\nand establishing the children with Mrs. Harman at Black Strand. There\nwas an exceptional amount of packing up to do, for this time Lady Harman\nfelt she was not coming back--it might be for years. They were going out\nto warmth and sunlight for the rest of Sir Isaac's life.\n\nHe was entering upon the last phase in the slow disorganization of his\nsecretions and the progressive hardening of his arterial tissues that\nhad become his essential history. His appearance had altered much in the\nlast few months; he had become visibly smaller, his face in particular\nhad become sharp and little-featured. It was more and more necessary for\nhim to sit up in order to breathe with comfort, he slept sitting up; and\nhis senses were affected, he complained of strange tastes in his food,\nquarrelled with the cook and had fits of sickness. Sometimes, latterly,\nhe had complained of strange sounds, like air whistling in water-pipes,\nhe said, that had no existence outside his ears. Moreover, he was\nsteadily more irritable and more suspicious and less able to control\nhimself when angry. A long-hidden vein of vile and abusive language,\nhidden, perhaps, since the days of Mr. Gambard's college at Ealing, came\nto the surface....\n\nFor some days after his seizure Lady Harman was glad to find in the\nstress of his necessities an excuse for disregarding altogether the\ncrisis in the hostels and the perplexing problem of her relations to Mr.\nBrumley. She wrote two brief notes to the latter gentleman breaking\nappointments and pleading pressure of business. Then, at first during\nintervals of sleeplessness at night, and presently during the day, the\ndanger and ugliness of her outlook began to trouble her. She was still,\nshe perceived, being watched, but whether that was because her husband\nhad failed to change whatever orders he had given, or because he was\nstill keeping himself minutely informed of her movements, she could not\ntell. She was now constantly with him, and except for small spiteful\noutbreaks and occasional intervals of still and silent malignity, he\ntolerated and utilized her attentions. It was clear his jealousy of her\nrankled, a jealousy that made him even resentful at her health and ready\nto complain of any brightness of eye or vigour of movement. They had\ndrifted far apart from the possibility of any real discussion of the\nhostels since that talk in the twilit study. To re-open that now or to\ncomplain of the shadowing pursuer who dogged her steps abroad would\nhave been to precipitate Mr. Brumley's dismissal.\n\nEven at the cost of letting things drift at the hostels for a time she\nwished to avoid that question. She would not see him, but she would not\nshut the door upon him. So far as the detective was concerned she could\navoid discussion by pretending to be unaware of his existence, and as\nfor the hostels--the hostels each day were left until the morrow.\n\nShe had learnt many things since the days of her first rebellion, and\nshe knew now that this matter of the man friend and nothing else in the\nworld is the central issue in the emancipation of women. The difficulty\nof him is latent in every other restriction of which women complain. The\ncomplete emancipation of women will come with complete emancipation of\nhumanity from jealousy--and no sooner. All other emancipations are shams\nuntil a woman may go about as freely with this man as with that, and\nnothing remains for emancipation when she can. In the innocence of her\nfirst revolt this question of friendship had seemed to Lady Harman the\nsimplest, most reasonable of minor concessions, but that was simply\nbecause Mr. Brumley hadn't in those days been talking of love to her,\nnor she been peeping through that once locked door. Now she perceived\nhow entirely Sir Isaac was by his standards justified.\n\nAnd after all that was recognized she remained indisposed to give up Mr.\nBrumley.\n\nYet her sense of evil things happening in the hostels was a deepening\ndistress. It troubled her so much that she took the disagreeable step of\nasking Mrs. Pembrose to meet her at the Bloomsbury Hostel and talk out\nthe expulsions. She found that lady alertly defensive, entrenched behind\nexpert knowledge and pretension generally. Her little blue eyes seemed\nharder than ever, the metallic resonance in her voice more marked, the\nlisp stronger. \"Of course, Lady Harman, if you were to have some\npractical experience of control----\" and \"Three times I have given these\ngirls every opportunity--_every_ opportunity.\"\n\n\"It seems so hard to drive these girls out,\" repeated Lady Harman.\n\"They're such human creatures.\"\n\n\"You have to think of the ones who remain. You must--think of the\nInstitution as a Whole.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Lady Harman, peering down into profundities for a\nmoment. Below the great truth glimmered and vanished that Institutions\nwere made for man and not man for Institutions.\n\n\"You see,\" she went on, rather to herself than to Mrs. Pembrose, \"we\nshall be away now for a long time.\"\n\nMrs. Pembrose betrayed no excesses of grief.\n\n\"It's no good for me to interfere and then leave everything....\"\n\n\"That way spells utter disorganization,\" said Mrs. Pembrose.\n\n\"But I wish something could be done to lessen the harshness--to save\nthe pride--of such a girl as Alice Burnet. Practically you tell her she\nisn't fit to associate with--the other girls.\"\n\n\"She's had her choice and warning after warning.\"\n\n\"I daresay she's--stiff. Oh!--she's difficult. But--being expelled is\nbitter.\"\n\n\"I've not _expelled_ her--technically.\"\n\n\"She thinks she's expelled....\"\n\n\"You'd rather perhaps, Lady Harman, that _I_ was expelled.\"\n\nThe dark lady lifted her eyes to the little bridling figure in front of\nher for a moment and dropped them again. She had had an unspeakable\nthought, that Mrs. Pembrose wasn't a gentlewoman, and that this sort of\nthing was a business for the gentle and for nobody else in the world.\n\"I'm only anxious not to hurt anyone if I can help it,\" said Lady\nHarman.\n\nShe went on with her attempt to find some way of compromise with Mrs.\nPembrose that should save the spirit of the new malcontents. She was\nmuch too concerned on account of the things that lay ahead of them to\ncare for her own pride with Mrs. Pembrose. But that good lady had all\nthe meagre inflexibilities of her class and at last Lady Harman ceased.\n\nShe came out into the great hall of the handsome staircase, ushered by\nMrs. Pembrose as a guest is ushered by a host. She looked at the\nspacious proportion of the architecture and thought of the hopes and\nimaginations she had allowed to centre upon this place. It was to have\nbeen a glowing home of happy people, and over it all brooded the chill\nstillness of rules and regulations and methodical suppressions and\ntactful discouragement. It was an Institution, it had the empty\norderliness of an Institution, Mrs. Pembrose had just called it an\nInstitution, and so Susan Burnet had prophesied it would become five\nyears or more ago. It was a dream subjugated to reality.\n\nSo it seemed to Lady Harman must all dreams be subjugated to reality,\nand the tossing spring greenery of the square, the sunshine, the tumult\nof sparrows and the confused sound of distant traffic, framed as it was\nin the hard dark outline of the entrance door, was as near as the\npromise of joy could ever come to her. \"Caught and spoilt,\" that seemed\nto be the very essential of her life; just as it was of these Hostels,\nall the hopes, the imaginings, the sweet large anticipations, the\ngenerosities, and stirring warm desires....\n\nPerhaps Lady Harman had been a little overworking with her preparations\nfor exile. Because as these unhappy thoughts passed through her mind she\nrealized that she was likely to weep. It was extremely undesirable that\nMrs. Pembrose should see her weeping.\n\nBut Mrs. Pembrose did see her weeping, saw her dark eyes swimming with\nuncontrollable tears, watched her walk past her and out, without a word\nor a gesture of farewell.\n\nA kind of perplexity came upon the soul of Mrs. Pembrose. She watched\nthe tall figure descend to her car and enter it and dispose itself\ngracefully and depart....\n\n\"Hysterical,\" whispered Mrs. Pembrose at last and was greatly comforted.\n\n\"Childish,\" said Mrs. Pembrose sipping further consolation for an\nunwonted spiritual discomfort.\n\n\"Besides,\" said Mrs. Pembrose, \"what else can one do?\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a78\n\nSir Isaac was greatly fatigued by his long journey to Santa Margherita\nin spite of every expensive precaution to relieve him; but as soon as\nthe effect of that wore off, his recovery under the system Bergener had\nprescribed was for a time remarkable. In a little while he was out of\nbed again and in an armchair. Then the young doctor began to talk of\ndrives. They had no car with them, so he went into Genoa and spent an\nenergetic day securing the sweetest-running automobile he could find and\nhaving it refitted for Sir Isaac's peculiar needs. In this they made a\nnumber of excursions through the hot beauty of the Italian afternoons,\neastward to Genoa, westward to Sestri and northward towards Montallegro.\nThen they went up to the summit of the Monte de Porto Fino and Sir Isaac\ndescended and walked about and looked at the view and praised Bergener.\nAfter that he was encouraged to visit the gracious old monastery that\noverhangs the road to Porto Fino.\n\nAt first Lady Harman did her duty of control and association with an\napathetic resignation. This had to go on--for eight or ten years. Then\nher imagination began to stir again. There came a friendly letter from\nMr. Brumley and she answered with a description of the colour of the sea\nand the charm and wonder of its tideless shore. The three elder children\nwrote queer little letters and she answered them. She went into Rapallo\nand got herself a carriageful of Tauchnitz books....\n\nThat visit to the monastery on the Porto Fino road was like a pleasant\nlittle glimpse into the brighter realities of the Middle Ages. The\nplace, which is used as a home of rest for convalescent Carthusians,\nchanced to be quite empty and deserted; the Bavarian rang a jangling\nbell again and again and at last gained the attention of an old gardener\nworking in the vineyard above, an unkempt, unshaven, ungainly creature\ndressed in scarce decent rags of brown, who was yet courteous-minded\nand, albeit crack-voiced, with his yellow-fanged mouth full of gracious\npolysyllables. He hobbled off to get a key and returned through the\nstill heat of the cobbled yard outside the monastery gates, and took\nthem into cool airy rooms and showed them clean and simple cells in\nshady corridors, and a delightful orangery, and led them to a beautiful\nterrace that looked out upon the glowing quivering sea. And he became\nvery anxious to tell them something about \"Francesco\"; they could not\nunderstand him until the doctor caught \"Battaglia\" and \"Pavia\" and had\nan inspiration. Francis the First, he explained in clumsy but\nunderstandable English, slept here, when he was a prisoner of the\nEmperor and all was lost but honour. They looked at the slender pillars\nand graceful archings about them.\n\n\"Chust as it was now,\" the young doctor said, his imagination touched\nfor a moment by mere unscientific things....\n\nThey returned to their d\u00c3\u00a9pendance in a state of mutual contentment, Sir\nIsaac scarcely tired, and Lady Harman ran upstairs to change her dusty\ndress for a fresher muslin, while he went upon the doctor's arm to the\nbalcony where tea was to be served to them.\n\nShe came down to find her world revolutionized.\n\nOn the table in the balcony the letters had been lying convenient to his\nchair and he--it may be without troubling to read the address, had\nseized the uppermost and torn it open.\n\nHe was holding that letter now a little crumpled in his hand.\n\nShe had walked close up to the table before she realized the change. The\nlittle eyes that met hers were afire with hatred, his lips were white\nand pressed together tightly, his nostrils were dilated in his struggle\nfor breath. \"I knew it,\" he gasped.\n\nShe clung to her dignity though she felt suddenly weak within. \"That\nletter,\" she said, \"was addressed to me.\"\n\nThere was a gleam of derision in his eyes.\n\n\"Look at it!\" he said, and flung it towards her.\n\n\"My private letter!\"\n\n\"Look at it!\" he repeated.\n\n\"What right have you to open my letter?\"\n\n\"Friendship!\" he said. \"Harmless friendship! Look what your--friend\nsays!\"\n\n\"Whatever there was in my letter----\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Sir Isaac. \"Don't come _that_ over me! Don't you try it!\nOooh! phew--\" He struggled for breath for a time. \"He's so harmless.\nHe's so helpful. He----Read it, you----\"\n\nHe hesitated and then hurled a strange word at her.\n\nShe glanced at the letter on the table but made no movement to touch it.\nThen she saw that her husband's face was reddening and that his arm\nwaved helplessly. His eyes, deprived abruptly of all the fury of\nconflict, implored assistance.\n\nShe darted to the French window that opened into the dining-room from\nthe balcony. \"Doctor Greve!\" she cried. \"Doctor Greve!\"\n\nBehind her the patient was making distressful sounds. \"Doctor Greve,\"\nshe screamed, and from above she heard the Bavarian shouting and then\nthe noise of his coming down the stairs.\n\nHe shouted some direction in German as he ran past her. By an\ninspiration she guessed he wanted the nurse.\n\nMiss Summersley Satchell appeared in the doorway and became helpful.\n\nThen everyone in the house seemed to be converging upon the balcony.\n\nIt was an hour before Sir Isaac was in bed and sufficiently allayed for\nher to go to her own room. Then she thought of Mr. Brumley's letter, and\nrecovered it from the table on the balcony where it had been left in the\ntumult of her husband's seizure.\n\nIt was twilight and the lights were on. She stood under one of them and\nread with two moths circling about her....\n\nMr. Brumley had had a mood of impassioned declaration. He had alluded to\nhis \"last moments of happiness at Kew.\" He said he would rather kiss the\nhem of her garment than be the \"lord of any other woman's life.\"\n\nIt was all so understandable--looked at in the proper light. It was all\nso impossible to explain. And why had she let it happen? Why had she let\nit happen?\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a79\n\nThe young doctor was a little puzzled and rather offended by Sir Isaac's\nrelapse. He seemed to consider it incorrect and was on the whole\ndisposed to blame Lady Harman. He might have had such a seizure, the\nyoung doctor said, later, but not now. He would be thrown back for some\nweeks, then he would begin to mend again and then whatever he said,\nwhatever he did, Lady Harman must do nothing to contradict him. For a\nwhole day Sir Isaac lay inert, in a cold sweat. He consented once to\nattempt eating, but sickness overcame him. He seemed so ill that all the\nyoung doctor's reassurances could not convince Lady Harman that he\nwould recover. Then suddenly towards evening his arrested vitality was\nflowing again, the young doctor ceased to be anxious for his own\nassertions, the patient could sit up against a pile of pillows and\nbreathe and attend to affairs. There was only one affair he really\nseemed anxious to attend to. His first thought when he realized his\nreturning strength was of his wife. But the young doctor would not let\nhim talk that night.\n\nNext morning he seemed still stronger. He was restless and at last\ndemanded Lady Harman again.\n\nThis time the young doctor transmitted the message.\n\nShe came to him forthwith and found him, white-faced and\nunfamiliar-looking, his hands gripping the quilt and his eyes burning\nwith hatred.\n\n\"You thought I'd forgotten,\" was his greeting.\n\n\"Don't argue,\" signalled the doctor from the end of Sir Isaac's bed.\n\n\"I've been thinking it out,\" said Sir Isaac. \"When you were thinking I\nwas too ill to think.... I know better now.\"\n\nHe sucked in his lips and then went on. \"You've got to send for old\nCrappen,\" he said. \"I'm going to alter things. I had a plan. But that\nwould have been letting you off too easy. See? So--you send for old\nCrappen.\"\n\n\"What do you mean to do?\"\n\n\"Never you mind, my lady, never you mind. You send for old Crappen.\"\n\nShe waited for a moment. \"Is that all you want me to do?\"\n\n\"I'm going to make it all right about those Hostels. Don't you fear. You\nand your Hostels! You shan't _touch_ those hostels ever again. Ever.\nMrs. Pembrose go! Why! You ain't worthy to touch the heel of her shoe!\nMrs. Pembrose!\"\n\nHe gathered together all his forces and suddenly expelled with rousing\nforce the word he had already applied to her on the day of the\nintercepted letter.\n\nHe found it seemed great satisfaction in the sound and taste of it. He\nrepeated it thrice. \"Zut,\" cried the doctor, \"Sssh!\"\n\nThen Sir Isaac intimated his sense that calm was imperative. \"You send\nfor Crappen,\" he said with a quiet earnestness.\n\nShe had become now so used to terms of infamy during the last year or\nso, so accustomed to forgive them as part of his suffering, that she\nseemed not to hear the insult.\n\n\"Do you want him at once?\" she asked. \"Shall I telegraph?\"\n\n\"Want him at once!\" He dropped his voice to a whisper. \"Yes, you\nfool--yes. Telegraph. (Phew.) Telegraph.... I mustn't get angry, you\nknow. You--telegraph.\"\n\nHe became suddenly still. But his eyes were active with hate.\n\nShe glanced at the doctor, then moved to the door.\n\n\"I will send a telegram,\" she said, and left him still malignant.\n\nShe closed the door softly and walked down the long cool passage towards\nher own room....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a710\n\nShe had to be patient. She had to be patient. This sort of thing had to\ngo on from crisis to crisis. It might go on for years. She could see no\nremedy and no escape.\n\nWhat else was there to do but be patient? It was all amazing unjust, but\nto be a married woman she was beginning to understand is to be outside\njustice. It is autocracy. She had once imagined otherwise, and most of\nher life had been the slow unlearning of that initial error. She had\nimagined that the hostels were hers simply because he had put it in that\nway. They had never been anything but his, and now it was manifest he\nwould do what he liked with his own. The law takes no cognizance of the\nunwritten terms of a domestic reconciliation.\n\nShe sat down at the writing-table the hotel management had improvised\nfor her.\n\nShe rested her chin on her hand and tried to think out her position. But\nwhat was there to think out, seeing that nature and law and custom have\nconspired together to put women altogether under the power of jealous\nand acquisitive men?\n\nShe drew the telegram form towards her.\n\nShe was going to write a telegram that she knew would bring Crappen\nheadlong--to disinherit her absolutely. And--it suddenly struck her--her\nhusband had trusted her to write it. She was going to do what he had\ntrusted her to do.... But it was absurd.\n\nShe sat making patterns of little dots with her pencil point upon the\ntelegram form, and there was a faint smile of amusement upon her lips.\n\nIt was absurd--and everything was absurd. What more was to be said or\nthought about it? This was the lot of woman. She had made her struggle,\nrebelled her little bit of rebellion. Most other women no doubt had done\nas much. It made no difference in the long run.\n\nBut it was hard to give up the hostels. She had been foolish of course,\nbut she had not let them make her feel _real_. And she wasn't real. She\nwas a wife--just _this_....\n\nShe sighed and bestirred herself and began to write.\n\nThen abruptly she stopped writing.\n\nFor three years her excuse for standing--everything, had been these\nhostels. If now the hostels were to be wrenched out of her hands, if at\nher husband's death she was to be stripped of every possession and left\na helpless dependant on her own children, if for all her good behaviour\nshe was to be insulted by his frantic suspicions so long as he lived and\nthen disgraced by his posthumous mistrust; was there any reason why she\nshould go on standing anything any more? Away there in England was Mr.\nBrumley, _her_ man, ready with service and devotion....\n\nIt was a profoundly comforting thing to think of him there as hers. He\nwas hers. He'd given so much and on the whole so well. If at last she\nwere to go to him....\n\nYet when she came to imagine the reality of the step that was in her\nmind, it took upon itself a chill and forbidding strangeness. It was\nlike stepping out of a familiar house into empty space. What could it be\nlike? To take some odd trunks with her, meet him somewhere, travel,\ntravel through the evening, travel past nightfall? The bleak strangeness\nof that going out never to return!\n\nHer imagination could give her no figure of Mr. Brumley as intimate, as\nhabitual. She could as easily imagine his skeleton. He remained in all\nthis queer speculation something friendly, something incidental, more\nthan a trifle disembodied, entirely devoted of course in that hovering\nway--but hovering....\n\nAnd she wanted to be free. It wasn't Mr. Brumley she wanted; he was but\na means--if indeed he was a means--to an end. The person she wanted, the\nperson she had always wanted--was _herself_. Could Mr. Brumley give her\nthat? Would Mr. Brumley give her that? Was it conceivable he would carry\nsacrifice to such a pitch as that?...\n\nAnd what nonsense was this dream! Here was her husband needing her. And\nthe children, whose inherent ungainliness, whose ungracious spirits\ndemanded a perpetual palliation of culture and instilled deportment.\nWhat honest over-nurse was there for him or helper and guide and friend\nfor them, if she withdrew? There was something undignified in a flight\nfor mere happiness. There was something vindictive in flight from mere\ninsult. To go, because she was disinherited, because her hostels were\nshattered,--No! And in short--she couldn't do it....\n\nIf Sir Isaac wanted to disinherit her he must disinherit her. If he\nwanted to go on seizing and reading her letters, then he could. There\nwas nothing in the whole scheme of things to stop him if he did not want\nto stop himself, nothing at all. She was caught. This was the lot of\nwomen. She was a _wife_. What else in honour was there but to be a wife\nup to the hilt?...\n\nShe finished writing her telegram.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a711\n\nSuddenly came a running in the passage outside, a rap at the door and\nthe nurse entered, scared, voluble in Italian, but with gestures that\ntranslated her.\n\nLady Harman rose, realized the gravity and urgency of the moment and\nhurried with her along the passage. \"Est-il mauvais?\" the poor lady\nattempted, \"Est-il----\"\n\nOh! what words are there for \"taken worse\"?\n\nThe woman attempted English and failed. She resorted to her native\nItalian and exclaimed about the \"povero signore.\" She conveyed a sense\nof pitiful extremities. Could it be he was in pain again? What was it?\nWhat was it? Ten minutes ago he had been so grimly angry.\n\nAt the door of the sick room the nurse laid a warning hand on the arm of\nLady Harman and made an apprehensive gesture. They entered almost\nnoiselessly.\n\nThe Bavarian doctor turned his face from the bed at their entrance. He\nwas bending over Sir Isaac. He held up one hand as if to arrest them;\nhis other was engaged with his patient. \"No,\" he said. His attention\nwent back to the sick man, and he remained very still in that position,\nleaving Lady Harman to note for the first time how broad and flat he was\nboth between his shoulders and between his ears. Then his face came\nround slowly, he relinquished something heavy, stood up, held up a hand.\n\"Zu sp\u00c3\u00a4t,\" he whispered, as though he too was surprised. He sought in\nhis mind for English and then found his phrase: \"He has gone!\"\n\n\"Gone?\"\n\n\"In one instant.\"\n\n\"Dead?\"\n\n\"So. In one instant.\"\n\nOn the bed lay Sir Isaac. His hand was thrust out as though he grasped\nat some invisible thing. His open eyes stared hard at his wife, and as\nshe met his eyes he snored noisily in his nose and throat.\n\nShe looked from the doctor to the nurse. It seemed to her that both\nthese people must be mad. Never had she seen anything less like death.\n\"But he's not dead!\" she protested, still standing in the middle of the\nroom.\n\n\"It iss chust the air in his throat,\" the doctor said. \"He went--_so!_\nIn one instant as I was helping him.\"\n\nHe waited to see some symptom of feminine weakness. There was a quality\nin his bearing--as though this event did him credit.\n\n\"But--Isaac!\"\n\nIt was astounding. The noise in his throat ceased. But he still stared\nat her. And then the nurse made a kind of assault upon Lady Harman,\ncaught her--even if she didn't fall. It was no doubt the proper formula\nto collapse. Or to fling oneself upon the deceased. Lady Harman resisted\nthis assistance, disentangled herself and remained amazed; the nurse a\nlittle disconcerted but still ready behind her.\n\n\"But,\" said Lady Harman slowly, not advancing and pointing incredulously\nat the unwinking stare that met her own, \"is he dead? Is he really dead?\nLike that?\"\n\nThe doctor's gesture to the nurse betrayed his sense of the fine quick\nscene this want of confidence had ruined. Under no circumstances in life\ndid English people really seem to know how to behave or what was\nexpected of them. He answered with something bordering upon irony.\n\"Madam,\" he said, with a slight bow, \"he is _really_ det.\"\n\n\"But--like _that_!\" cried Lady Harman.\n\n\"Like that,\" repeated the doctor.\n\nShe went three steps nearer and stopped, open-eyed, wonder-struck, her\nlips compressed.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a712\n\nFor a time astonishment overwhelmed her mind. She did not think of Sir\nIsaac, she did not think of herself, her whole being was filled by this\nmarvel of death and cessation. Like _that_!\n\nDeath!\n\nNever before had she seen it. She had expected an extreme dignity, an\nalmost ceremonial sinking back, a slow ebbing, but this was like a shot\nfrom a bow. It stunned her. And for some time she remained stunned,\nwhile the doctor and her secretary and the hotel people did all that\nthey deemed seemly on this great occasion. She let them send her into\nanother room; she watched with detached indifference a post-mortem\nconsultation in whispers with a doctor from Rapallo. Then came a great\nclosing of shutters. The nurse and her maid hovered about her, ready to\nassist her when the sorrowing began. But she had no sorrow. The long\nmoments lengthened out, and he was still dead and she was still only\namazement. It seemed part of the extraordinary, the perennial\nsurprisingness of Sir Isaac that he should end in this way. Dead! She\ndidn't feel for some hours that he had in any way ended. He had died\nwith such emphasis that she felt now that he was capable of anything.\nWhat mightn't he do next? When she heard movements in the chamber of\ndeath it seemed to her that of all the people there, most probably it\nwas he who made them. She would not have been amazed if he had suddenly\nappeared in the doorway of her room, anger-white and his hand\nquiveringly extended, spluttering some complaint.\n\nHe might have cried: \"Here I am dead! And it's _you_, damn you--it's\n_you_!\"\n\nIt was after distinct efforts, after repeated visits to the room in\nwhich he lay, that she began to realize that death was death, that death\ngoes on, that there was no more any Sir Isaac, but only a still body he\nhad left behind, that was being moulded now into a stiff image of peace.\n\nThen for a time she roused herself to some control of their proceedings.\nThe doctor came to Lady Harman to ask her about the meals for the day,\nthe hotel manager was in entanglements of tactful consideration, and\nthen the nurse came for instructions upon some trivial matter. They had\ndone what usage prescribes and now, in the absence of other direction,\nthey appealed to her wishes. She remarked that everyone was going on\ntiptoe and speaking in undertones....\n\nShe realized duties. What does one have to do when one's husband is\ndead? People would have to be told. She would begin by sending off\ntelegrams to various people, to his mother, to her own, to his lawyer.\nShe remembered she had already written a telegram--that very morning to\nCrappen. Should she still let the lawyer come out? He was her lawyer\nnow. Perhaps he had better come, but instead of that telegram, which\nstill lay upon the desk, she would wire the news of the death to him....\n\nDoes one send to the papers? How does one send to the papers?\n\nShe took Miss Summersly Satchell who was hovering outside in the\nsunshine on the balcony, into her room, and sat pale and businesslike\nand very careful about details, while Miss Summersly Satchell offered\npractical advice and took notes and wrote telegrams and letters....\n\nThere came a hush over everything as the day crept towards noon, and the\nwidowed woman sat in her own room with an inactive mind, watching thin\nbars of sunlight burn their slow way across the floor. He was dead. It\nwas going on now more steadfastly than ever. He was keeping dead. He was\ndead at last for good and her married life was over, that life that had\nalways seemed the only possible life, and this stunning incident, this\nthing that was like the blinding of eyes or the bursting of eardrums,\nwas to be the beginning of strange new experiences.\n\nShe was afraid at first at their possible strangeness. And then, you\nknow, in spite of a weak protesting compunction she began to feel\nglad....\n\nShe would not admit to herself that she was glad, that she was anything\nbut a woman stunned, she maintained her still despondent attitude as\nlong as she could, but gladness broke upon her soul as the day breaks,\nand a sense of release swam up to the horizons of her mind and rose upon\nher, flooding every ripple of her being, as the sun rises over water in\na clear sky. Presently she could sit there no longer, she had to stand\nup. She walked to the closed Venetians to look out upon the world and\nchecked herself upon the very verge of flinging them open. He was dead\nand it was all over for ever. Of course!--it was all over! Her marriage\nwas finished and done. Miss Satchell came to summon her to lunch.\nThroughout that meal Lady Harman maintained a sombre bearing, and\nlistened with attention to the young doctor's comments on the manner of\nSir Isaac's going. And then,--it was impossible to go back to her room.\n\n\"My head aches,\" she said, \"I must go down and sit by the sea,\" and her\nmaid, a little shocked, brought her not only her sunshade, but needless\nwraps--as though a new-made widow must necessarily be very sensitive to\nthe air. She would not let her maid come with her, she went down to the\nbeach alone. She sat on some rocks near the very edge of the transparent\nwater and fought her gladness for a time and presently yielded to it. He\nwas dead. One thought filled her mind, for a while so filled her mind,\nthat no other thought it seemed could follow it, it had an effect of\nbeing final; it so filled her mind that it filled the whole world; the\nbroad sapphire distances of the sea, the lapping waves amidst the rocks\nat her feet, the blazing sun, the dark headland of Porto Fino and a\nsmall sailing boat that hung beyond came all within it like things\nenclosed within a golden globe. She forgot all the days of nursing and\ndiscomfort and pity behind her, all the duties and ceremonies before\nher, forgot all the details and circumstances of life in this one\nluminous realization. She was free at last. She was a free woman.\n\nNever more would he make a sound or lift a finger against her life,\nnever more would he contradict her or flout her; never more would he\ncome peeping through that papered panel between his room and hers, never\nmore could hateful and humiliating demands be made upon her as his\nright; no more strange distresses of the body nor raw discomfort of the\nnerves could trouble her--for ever. And no more detectives, no more\nsuspicions, no more accusations. That last blow he had meant to aim was\nfrozen before it could strike her. And she would have the Hostels in her\nhands, secure and undisputed, she could deal as she liked with Mrs.\nPembrose, take such advisers as she pleased.... She was free.\n\nShe found herself planning the regeneration of those difficult and\ndisputed hostels, plans that were all coloured by the sun and sky of\nItaly. The manacles had gone; her hands were free. She would make this\nher supreme occupation. She had learnt her lesson now she felt, she knew\nsomething of the mingling of control and affectionate regard that was\nneeded to weld the warring uneasy units of her new community. And she\ncould do it, now as she was and unencumbered, she knew this power was\nin her. When everything seemed lost to her, suddenly it was all back in\nher hands....\n\nShe discovered the golden serenity of her mind with a sudden\nastonishment and horror. She was amazed and shocked that she should be\nglad. She struggled against it and sought to subdue her spirit to a\nbecoming grief. One should be sorrowful at death in any case, one should\nbe grieved. She tried to think of Sir Isaac with affection, to recall\ntouching generosities, to remember kind things and tender and sweet\nthings and she could not do so. Nothing would come back but the white\nintensities of his face, nothing but his hatred, his suspicion and his\npitiless mean mastery. From which she was freed.\n\nShe could not feel sorry. She did her utmost to feel sorry; presently\nwhen she went back into the d\u00c3\u00a9pendance, she had to check her feet to a\nregretful pace; she dreaded the eyes of the hotel visitors she passed in\nthe garden lest they should detect the liberation of her soul. But the\nhotel visitors being English were for the most part too preoccupied with\nmanifestations of a sympathy that should be at once heart-felt and quite\nunobtrusive and altogether in the best possible taste, to have any\nattention free for the soul of Lady Harman.\n\nThe sense of her freedom came and went like the sunlight of a day in\nspring, though she attempted her utmost to remain overcast. After dinner\nthat night she was invaded by a vision of the great open years before\nher, at first hopeful but growing at last to fear and a wild\nrestlessness, so that in defiance of possible hotel opinion, she\nwandered out into the moonlight and remained for a long time standing by\nthe boat landing, dreaming, recovering, drinking in the white serenities\nof sea and sky. There was no hurry now. She might stay there as long as\nshe chose. She need account for herself to no one; she was free. She\nmight go where she pleased, do what she pleased, there was no urgency\nany more....\n\nThere was Mr. Brumley. Mr. Brumley made a very little figure at first in\nthe great prospect before her.... Then he grew larger in her thoughts.\nShe recalled his devotions, his services, his self-control. It was good\nto have one understanding friend in this great limitless world....\n\nShe would have to keep that friendship....\n\nBut the glorious thing was freedom, to live untrammelled....\n\nThrough the stillness a little breeze came stirring, and she awoke out\nof her dream and turned and faced the shuttered d\u00c3\u00a9pendance. A solitary\ndim light was showing on the verandah. All the rest of the building was\na shapeless mass of grey. The long pale front of the hotel seen through\na grove of orange trees was lit now at every other window with people\ngoing to bed. Beyond, a black hillside clambered up to the edge of the\nsky.\n\nFar away out of the darknesses a man with a clear strong voice was\nsinging to a tinkling accompaniment.\n\nIn the black orange trees swam and drifted a score of fireflies, and\nthere was a distant clamour of nightingales when presently the unseen\nvoice had done.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a713\n\nWhen she was in her room again she began to think of Sir Isaac and more\nparticularly of that last fixed stare of his....\n\nShe was impelled to go and see him, to see for herself that he was\npeaceful and no longer a figure of astonishment. She went slowly along\nthe corridor and very softly into his room--it remained, she felt, his\nroom. They had put candles about him, and the outline of his face,\nshowing dimly through the linen that veiled it, was like the face of one\nwho sleeps very peacefully. Very gently she uncovered it.\n\nHe was not simply still, he was immensely still. He was more still and\nwhite than the moonlight outside, remoter than moon or stars.... She\nstood surveying him.\n\nHe looked small and pinched and as though he had been very tired. Life\nwas over for him, altogether over. Never had she seen anything that\nseemed so finished. Once, when she was a girl she had thought that death\nmight be but the opening of a door upon a more generous feast of living\nthan this cramped world could give, but now she knew, she saw, that\ndeath can be death.\n\nLife was over. She felt she had never before realized the meaning of\ndeath. That beautiful night outside, and all the beautiful nights and\ndays that were still to come and all the sweet and wonderful things of\nGod's world could be nothing to him now for ever. There was no dream in\nhim that could ever live again, there was no desire, no hope in him.\n\nAnd had he ever had his desire or his hope, or felt the intensities of\nlife?\n\nThere was this beauty she had been discovering in the last few years,\nthis mystery of love,--all that had been hidden from him.\n\nShe began to realize something sorrowful and pitiful in his quality, in\nhis hardness, his narrowness, his bickering suspicions, his malignant\nrefusals of all things generous and beautiful. He made her feel, as\nsometimes the children made her feel, the infinite pity of perversity\nand resistance to the bounties and kindliness of life.\n\nThe shadow of sorrow for him came to her at last.\n\nYet how obstinate he looked, the little frozen white thing that had been\nSir Isaac Harman! And satisfied, wilfully satisfied; his lips were\ncompressed and his mouth a little drawn in at the corners as if he would\nnot betray any other feeling than content with the bargain he had made\nwith life. She did not touch him; not for the world would she ever touch\nthat cold waxen thing that had so lately clasped her life, but she stood\nfor a long time by the side of his quiet, immersed in the wonder of\ndeath....\n\nHe had been such a hard little man, such a pursuing little man, so\nunreasonable and difficult a master, and now--he was such a poor\nshrunken little man for all his obstinacy! She had never realized before\nthat he was pitiful.... Had she perhaps feared him too much, disliked\nhim too much to deal fairly with him? Could she have helped him? Was\nthere anything she could have done that she had not done? Might she not\nat least have saved him his suspicion? Behind his rages, perhaps he had\nbeen wretched.\n\nCould anyone else have helped him? If perhaps someone had loved him more\nthan she had ever pretended to do----\n\nHow strange that she should be so intimately in this room--and still so\nalien. So alien that she could feel nothing but detached wonder at his\ninfinite loss.... _Alien_,--that was what she had always been, a\ncaptured alien in this man's household,--a girl he had taken. Had he\never suspected how alien? The true mourner, poor woman! was even now, in\ncharge of Cook's couriers and interpreters, coming by express from\nLondon, to see with her own eyes this last still phase of the son she\nhad borne into the world and watched and sought to serve. She was his\nnearest; she indeed was the only near thing there had ever been in his\nlife. Once at least he must have loved her? And even she had not been\nvery near. No one had ever been very near his calculating suspicious\nheart. Had he ever said or thought any really sweet or tender\nthing--even about her? He had been generous to her in money matters, of\ncourse,--but out of a vast abundance....\n\nHow good it was to have a friend! How good it was to have even one\nsingle friend!...\n\nAt the thought of his mother Lady Harman's mind began to drift slowly\nfrom this stiff culmination of life before her. Presently she replaced\nthe white cloth upon his face and turned slowly away. Her imagination\nhad taken up the question of how that poor old lady was to be met, how\nshe was to be consoled, what was to be said to her....\n\nShe began to plan arrangements. The room ought to be filled with\nflowers; Mrs. Harman would expect flowers, large heavy white flowers in\ngreat abundance. That would have to be seen to soon. One might get them\nin Rapallo. And afterwards,--they would have to take him to England, and\nhave a fine great funeral, with every black circumstance his wealth and\nhis position demanded. Mrs. Harman would need that, and so it must be\ndone. Cabinet Ministers must follow him, members of Parliament, all\nBlenkerdom feeling self-consciously and, as far as possible, deeply, the\nChartersons by way of friends, unfamiliar blood relations, a vast\nretinue of employees....\n\nHow could one take him? Would he have to be embalmed? Embalming!--what a\nstrange complement of death. She averted herself a little more from the\nquiet figure on the bed, and could not turn to it again. They might come\nhere and do all sorts of things to it, mysterious, evil-seeming things\nwith knives and drugs....\n\nShe must not think of that. She must learn exactly what Mrs. Harman\nthought and desired. Her own apathy with regard to her husband had given\nway completely now to a desire to anticipate and meet Mrs. Harman's\nevery conceivable wish.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE TWELFTH\n\nLOVE AND A SERIOUS LADY\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a71\n\nThe news of Sir Isaac's death came quite unexpectedly to Mr. Brumley. He\nwas at the Climax Club, and rather bored; he had had some tea and dry\ntoast in the magazine room, and had been through the weeklies, and it\nwas a particularly uninteresting week. Then he came down into the hall,\nlooked idly at the latest bulletins upon the board, and read that \"Sir\nIsaac Harman died suddenly this morning at Sta. Margherita, in Ligure,\nwhither he had gone for rest and change.\"\n\nHe went on mechanically reading down the bulletin, leaving something of\nhimself behind him that did not read on. Then he returned to that\nremarkable item and re-read it, and picked up that lost element of his\nbeing again.\n\nHe had awaited this event for so long, thought of it so often in such a\ngreat variety of relationships, dreamt of it, hoped for it, prayed for\nit, and tried not to think of it, that now it came to him in reality it\nseemed to have no substance or significance whatever. He had exhausted\nthe fact before it happened. Since first he had thought of it there had\npassed four long years, and in that time he had seen it from every\naspect, exhausted every possibility. It had become a theoretical\npossibility, the basis of continually less confident, continually more\nunsubstantial day dreams. Constantly he had tried not to think of it,\ntried to assure himself of Sir Isaac's invalid immortality. And here it\nwas!\n\nThe line above it concerned an overdue ship, the line below resumed a\nspeech by Mr. Lloyd George. \"He would challenge the honourable member to\nrepeat his accusations----\"\n\nMr. Brumley stood quite still before the mauve-coloured print letters\nfor some time, then went slowly across the hall into the breakfast-room,\nsat down in a chair by the fireplace, and fell into a kind of\nfeatureless thinking. Sir Isaac was dead, his wife was free, and the\nlong waiting that had become a habit was at an end.\n\nHe had anticipated a wild elation, and for a while he was only sensible\nof change, a profound change....\n\nHe began to feel glad that he had waited, that she had insisted upon\npatience, that there had been no disaster, no scandal between them. Now\neverything was clear for them. He had served his apprenticeship. They\nwould be able to marry, and have no quarrel with the world.\n\nHe sat with his mind forming images of the prospect before him, images\nthat were at first feeble and vague, and then, though still in a silly\nway, more concrete and definite. At first they were quite petty\nanticipations, of how he would have to tell people of his approaching\nmarriage, of how he would break it to George Edmund that a new mother\nimpended. He mused for some time upon the details of that. Should he\ntake her down to George Edmund's school, and let the boy fall in love\nwith her--he would certainly fall in love with her--before anything\ndefinite was said, or should he first go down alone and break the news?\nEach method had its own attractive possibilities of drama.\n\nThen Mr. Brumley began to think of the letter he must write Lady\nHarman--a difficult letter. One does not rejoice at death. Already Mr.\nBrumley was beginning to feel a generous pity for the man he had done\nhis utmost not to detest for so long. Poor Sir Isaac had lived like a\nblind thing in the sunlight, gathering and gathering, when the pride and\npleasure of life is to administer and spend.... Mr. Brumley fell\nwondering just how she could be feeling now about her dead husband. She\nmight be in a phase of quite real sorrow. Probably the last illness had\ntired and strained her. So that his letter would have to be very fine\nand tender and soothing, free from all harshness, free from any\ngladness--yet it would be hard not to let a little of his vast relief\npeep out. Always hitherto, except for one or two such passionate lapses\nas that which had precipitated the situation at Santa Margherita, his\nepistolary manner had been formal, his matter intellectual and\nphilanthropic, for he had always known that no letter was absolutely\nsafe from Sir Isaac's insatiable research. Should he still be formal,\nstill write to \"Dear Lady Harman,\" or suddenly break into a new warmth?\nHalf an hour later he was sitting in the writing-room with some few\nflakes of torn paper on the carpet between his feet and the partially\nfilled wastepaper basket, still meditating upon this difficult issue of\nthe address.\n\nThe letter he achieved at last began, \"My dear Lady,\" and went on to, \"I\ndo not know how to begin this letter--perhaps you will find it almost as\ndifficult to receive....\"\n\nIn the small hours he woke to one of his habitual revulsions. Was that,\nhe asked himself, the sort of letter a lover should write to the beloved\non her release, on the sudden long prayed-for opening of a way to her,\non the end of her shameful servitude and his humiliations? He began to\nrecall the cold and stilted sentences of that difficult composition. The\ngentility of it! All his life he had been a prey to gentility, had cast\nhimself free from it, only to relapse again in such fashion as this.\nWould he never be human and passionate and sincere? Of course he was\nglad, and she ought to be glad, that Sir Isaac, their enemy and their\nprison, was dead; it was for them to rejoice together. He turned out of\nbed at last, when he could lie still under these self-accusations no\nlonger, and wrapped himself in his warm dressing-gown and began to\nwrite. He wrote in pencil. His fountain-pen was as usual on his night\ntable, but pencil seemed the better medium, and he wrote a warm and\nglowing love-letter that was brought to an end at last by an almost\npassionate fit of sneezing. He could find no envelopes in his bedroom\nDavenport, and so he left that honest scrawl under a paper-weight, and\nwent back to bed greatly comforted. He re-read it in the morning with\nemotion, and some slight misgivings that grew after he had despatched\nit. He went to lunch at his club contemplating a third letter that\nshould be sane and fine and sweet, and that should rectify the confusing\neffect of those two previous efforts. He wrote this letter later in the\nafternoon.\n\nThe days seemed very long before the answer to his first letter came to\nhim, and in that interval two more--aspects went to her. Her reply was\nvery brief, and written in the large, firm, still girlishly clear hand\nthat distinguished her.\n\n\"_I was so glad of your letter. My life is so strange here, a kind of\nhushed life. The nights are extraordinarily beautiful, the moon very\nlarge and the little leaves on the trees still and black. We are coming\nback to England and the funeral will be from our Putney house._\"\n\nThat was all, but it gave Mr. Brumley an impression of her that was\nexceedingly vivid and close. He thought of her, shadowy and dusky in the\nmoonlight until his soul swam with love for her; he had to get up and\nwalk about; he whispered her name very softly to himself several times;\nhe groaned gently, and at last he went to his little desk and wrote to\nher his sixth letter--quite a beautiful letter. He told her that he\nloved her, that he had always loved her since their first moment of\nmeeting, and he tried to express just the wave of tenderness that\ninundated him at the thought of her away there in Italy. Once, he said,\nhe had dreamt that he would be the first to take her to Italy. Perhaps\nsome day they would yet be in Italy together.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a72\n\nIt was only by insensible degrees that doubt crept into Mr. Brumley's\nassurances. He did not observe at once that none of the brief letters\nshe wrote him responded to his second, the impassioned outbreak in\npencil. And it seemed only in keeping with the modest reserves of\nwomanhood that she should be restrained--she always had been restrained.\n\nShe asked him not to see her at once when she returned to England; she\nwanted, she said, \"to see how things are,\" and that fell in very well\nwith a certain delicacy in himself. The unburied body of Sir Isaac--it\nwas now provisionally embalmed--was, through some inexplicable subtlety\nin his mind, a far greater barrier than the living man had ever been,\nand he wanted it out of the way. And everything settled. Then, indeed,\nthey might meet.\n\nMeanwhile he had a curious little private conflict of his own. He was\ntrying not to think, day and night he was trying not to think, that Lady\nHarman was now a very rich woman. Yet some portions of his brain, and he\nhad never suspected himself of such lawless regions, persisted in the\nmost vulgar and outrageous suggestions, suggestions that made his soul\nblush; schemes, for example, of splendid foreign travel, of hotel staffs\nbowing, of a yacht in the Mediterranean, of motor cars, of a palatial\nflat in London, of a box at the opera, of artists patronized, of--most\nhorrible!--a baronetcy.... The more authentic parts of Mr. Brumley\ncowered from and sought to escape these squalid dreams of magnificences.\nIt shocked and terrified him to find such things could come out in him.\nHe was like some pest-stricken patient, amazedly contemplating his first\nsymptom. His better part denied, repudiated. Of course he would never\ntouch, never even propose--or hint.... It was an aspect he had never\nonce contemplated before Sir Isaac died. He could on his honour, and\nafter searching his heart, say that. Yet in Pall Mall one afternoon,\nsuddenly, he caught himself with a thought in his head so gross, so\nsmug, that he uttered a faint cry and quickened his steps.... Benevolent\nstepfather!\n\nThese distresses begot a hope. Perhaps, after all, probably, there would\nbe some settlement.... She might not be rich, not so very rich.... She\nmight be tied up....\n\nHe perceived in that lay his hope of salvation. Otherwise--oh, pitiful\nsoul!--things were possible in him; he saw only too clearly what\ndreadful things were possible.\n\nIf only she were disinherited, if only he might take her, stripped of\nall these possessions that even in such glancing anticipations\nbegot----this horrid indigestion of the imagination!\n\nBut then,----the Hostels?...\n\nThere he stumbled against an invincible riddle!\n\nThere was something dreadful about the way in which these considerations\nblotted out the essential fact of separations abolished, barriers\nlowered, the way to an honourable love made plain and open....\n\nThe day of the funeral came at last, and Mr. Brumley tried not to think\nof it, paternally, at Margate. He fled from Sir Isaac's ultimate\nwithdrawal. Blenker's obituary notice in the _Old Country Gazette_ was a\nmasterpiece of tactful eulogy, ostentatiously loyal, yet extremely not\nunmindful of the widowed proprietor, and of all the possible changes of\nownership looming ahead. Mr. Brumley, reading it in the Londonward\ntrain, was greatly reminded of the Hostels. That was a riddle he didn't\nbegin to solve. Of course, it was imperative the Hostels should\ncontinue--imperative. Now they might run them together, openly, side by\nside. But then, with such temptations to hitherto inconceivable\nvulgarities. And again, insidiously, those visions returned of two\nfigures, manifestly opulent, grouped about a big motor car or standing\ntogether under a large subservient archway....\n\nThere was a long letter from her at his flat, a long and amazing letter.\nIt was so folded that his eye first caught the writing on the third\npage: \"_never marry again. It is so clear that our work needs all my\ntime and all my means._\" His eyebrows rose, his expression became\nconsternation; his hands trembled a little as he turned the letter over\nto read it through. It was a deliberate letter. It began--\n\n\"_Dear Mr. Brumley, I could never have imagined how much there is to do\nafter we are dead, and before we can be buried._\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Brumley; \"but what does this _mean_?\"\n\n\"_There are so many surprises_----\"\n\n\"It isn't clear.\"\n\n\"_In ourselves and the things about us._\"\n\n\"Of course, he would have made some complicated settlement. I might have\nknown.\"\n\n\"_It is the strangest thing in the world to be a widow, much stranger\nthan anyone could ever have supposed, to have no one to control one, no\none to think of as coming before one, no one to answer to, to be free to\nplan one's life for oneself_----\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stood with the letter in his hand after he had read it through,\nperplexed.\n\n\"I can't stand this,\" he said. \"I want to know.\"\n\nHe went to his desk and wrote:--\n\n\"_My Dear, I want you to marry me._\"\n\nWhat more was to be said? He hesitated with this brief challenge in his\nhand, was minded to telegraph it and thought of James's novel, _In the\nCage_. Telegraph operators are only human after all. He determined upon\na special messenger and rang up his quarter valet--he shared service in\nhis flat--to despatch it.\n\nThe messenger boy got back from Putney that evening about half-past\neight. He brought a reply in pencil.\n\n\"_My dear Friend_,\" she wrote. \"_You have been so good to me, so\nhelpful. But I do not think that is possible. Forgive me. I want so\nbadly to think and here I cannot think. I have never been able to think\nhere. I am going down to Black Strand, and in a day or so I will write\nand we will talk. Be patient with me._\"\n\nShe signed her name \"_Ellen_\"; always before she had been \"E.H.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" cried Mr. Brumley, \"but I want to know!\"\n\nHe fretted for an hour and went to the telephone.\n\nSomething was wrong with the telephone, it buzzed and went faint, and it\nwould seem that at her end she was embarrassed. \"I want to come to you\nnow,\" he said. \"Impossible,\" was the clearest word in her reply. Should\nhe go in a state of virile resolution, force her hesitation as a man\nshould? She might be involved there with Mrs. Harman, with all sorts of\nrelatives and strange people....\n\nIn the end he did not go.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a73\n\nHe sat at his lunch alone next day at one of the little tables men\nchoose when they shun company. But to the right of him was the table of\nthe politicians, Adolphus Blenker and Pope of the East Purblow\nExperiment, and Sir Piper Nicolls, and Munk, the editor of the _Daily\nRectification_, sage men all and deep in those mysterious manipulations\nand wire-pullings by which the liberal party organization was even then\npreparing for itself unusual distrust and dislike, and Horatio Blenker\nwas tenoring away after his manner about a case of right and conscience,\n\"Blenking like Winking\" was how a silent member had put it once to\nBrumley in a gust of hostile criticism. \"Practically if she marries\nagain, she is a pauper,\" struck on Brumley's ears.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Mr. Brumley, and stopped eating.\n\n\"I don't know if you remember the particulars of the Astor case,\" began\nMunk....\n\nNever had Mr. Brumley come so frankly to eavesdropping. But he heard no\nmore of Lady Harman. Munk had to quote the rights and wrongs of various\nAmerican wills, and then Mr. Pope seized his opportunity. \"At East\nPurblow,\" he went on, \"in quite a number of instances we had to envisage\nthis problem of the widow----\"\n\nMr. Brumley pushed back his plate and strolled towards the desk.\n\nIt was exactly what he might have expected, what indeed had been at the\nback of his mind all along, and on the whole he was glad. Naturally she\nhesitated; naturally she wanted time to think, and as naturally it was\nimpossible for her to tell him what it was she was thinking about.\n\nThey would marry. They must marry. Love has claims supreme over all\nother claims and he felt no doubt that for her his comparative poverty\nof two thousand a year would mean infinitely more happiness than she\nhad ever known or could know with Sir Isaac's wealth. She was reluctant,\nof course, to become dependent upon him until he made it clear to her\nwhat infinite pleasure it would be for him to supply her needs. Should\nhe write to her forthwith? He outlined a letter in his mind, a very fine\nand generous letter, good phrases came, and then he reflected that it\nwould be difficult to explain to her just how he had learnt of her\npeculiar situation. It would be far more seemly to wait either for a\npublic announcement or for some intimation from her.\n\nAnd then he began to realize that this meant the end of all their work\nat the Hostels. In his first satisfaction at escaping that possible\ngreat motor-car and all the superfluities of Sir Isaac's accumulation,\nhe had forgotten that side of the business....\n\nWhen one came to think it over, the Hostels did complicate the problem.\nIt was ingenious of Sir Isaac....\n\nIt was infernally ingenious of Sir Isaac....\n\nHe could not remain in the club for fear that somebody might presently\ncome talking to him and interrupt his train of thought. He went out into\nthe streets.\n\nThese Hostels upset everything.\n\nWhat he had supposed to be a way of escape was really the mouth of a\nnet.\n\nWhichever way they turned Sir Isaac crippled them....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a74\n\nMr. Brumley grew so angry that presently even the strangers in the\nstreet annoyed him. He turned his face homeward. He hated dilemmas; he\nwanted always to deny them, to thrust them aside, to take impossible\nthird courses.\n\n\"For three years,\" shouted Mr. Brumley, free at last in his study to\ngive way to his rage, \"for three years I've been making her care for\nthese things. And then--and then--they turn against me!\"\n\nA violent, incredibly undignified wrath against the dead man seized him.\nHe threw books about the room. He cried out vile insults and mingled\nwords of an unfortunate commonness with others of extreme rarity. He\nwanted to go off to Kensal Green and hammer at the grave there and tell\nthe departed knight exactly what he thought of him. Then presently he\nbecame calmer, he lit a pipe, picked up the books from the floor, and\nmeditated revenges upon Sir Isaac's memory. I deplore my task of\nrecording these ungracious moments in Mr. Brumley's love history. I\ndeplore the ease with which men pass from loving and serving women to an\nalmost canine fight for them. It is the ugliest essential of romance.\nThere is indeed much in the human heart that I deplore. But Mr. Brumley\nwas exasperated by disappointment. He was sore, he was raw. Driven by an\nintolerable desire to explore every possibility of the situation, full\nindeed of an unholy vindictiveness, he went off next morning with\nstrange questions to Maxwell Hartington.\n\nHe put the case as a general case.\n\n\"Lady Harman?\" said Maxwell Hartington.\n\n\"No, not particularly Lady Harman. A general principle. What are\npeople--what are women tied up in such a way to do?\"\n\nPrecedents were quoted and possibilities weighed. Mr. Brumley was\nflushed, vague but persistent.\n\n\"Suppose,\" he said, \"that they love each other passionately--and their\nwork, whatever it may be, almost as passionately. Is there no way----?\"\n\n\"He'll have a _dum casta_ clause right enough,\" said Maxwell Hartington.\n\n\"_Dum----? Dum casta!_ But, oh! anyhow that's out of the\nquestion--absolutely,\" said Mr. Brumley.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Maxwell Hartington, leaning back in his chair and\nrubbing the ball of his thumb into one eye. \"Of course--nobody ever\nenforces these _dum casta_ clauses. There isn't anyone to enforce them.\nEver.\"--He paused and then went on, speaking apparently to the array of\nblack tin boxes in the dingy fixtures before him. \"Who's going to watch\nyou? That's what I always ask in these cases. Unless the lady goes and\ndoes things right under the noses of these trustees they aren't going to\nbother. Even Sir Isaac I suppose hasn't provided funds for a private\ndetective. Eh? You said something?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Mr. Brumley.\n\n\"Well, why should they start a perfectly rotten action like that,\"\ncontinued Maxwell Hartington, now addressing himself very earnestly to\nhis client, \"when they've only got to keep quiet and do their job and be\ncomfortable. In these matters, Brumley, as in most matters affecting the\nrelations of men and women, people can do absolutely what they like\nnowadays, absolutely, unless there's someone about ready to make a row.\nThen they can't do anything. It hardly matters if they don't do\nanything. A row's a row and damned disgraceful. If there isn't a row,\nnothing's disgraceful. Of course all these laws and regulations and\ninstitutions and arrangements are just ways of putting people at the\nmercy of blackmailers and jealous and violent persons. One's only got to\nbe a lawyer for a bit to realize that. Still that's not _our_ business.\nThat's psychology. If there aren't any jealous and violent persons\nabout, well, then no ordinary decent person is going to worry what you\ndo. No decent person ever does. So far as I can gather the only\nbarbarian in this case is the testator--now in Kensal Green. With\nadditional precautions I suppose in the way of an artistic but\nthoroughly massive monument presently to be added----\"\n\n\"He'd--turn in his grave.\"\n\n\"Let him. No trustees are obliged to take action on _that_. I don't\nsuppose they'd know if he did. I've never known a trustee bother yet\nabout post-mortem movements of any sort. If they did, we'd all be having\nPrayers for the Dead. Fancy having to consider the subsequent\nreflections of the testator!\"\n\n\"Well anyhow,\" said Mr. Brumley, after a little pause, \"such a breach,\nsuch a proceeding is out of the question--absolutely out of the\nquestion. It's unthinkable.\"\n\n\"Then why did you come here to ask me about it?\" demanded Maxwell\nHartington, beginning to rub the other eye in an audible and unpleasant\nmanner.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a75\n\nWhen at last Mr. Brumley was face to face with Lady Harman again, a vast\nmephitic disorderly creation of anticipations, intentions, resolves,\nsuspicions, provisional hypotheses, urgencies, vindications, and wild\nand whirling stuff generally vanished out of his mind. There beside the\nraised seat in the midst of the little rock garden where they had talked\ntogether five years before, she stood waiting for him, this tall simple\nwoman he had always adored since their first encounter, a little strange\nand shy now in her dead black uniform of widowhood, but with her honest\neyes greeting him, her friendly hands held out to him. He would have\nkissed them but for the restraining presence of Snagsby who had brought\nhim to her; as it was it seemed to him that the phantom of a kiss passed\nlike a breath between them. He held her hands for a moment and\nrelinquished them.\n\n\"It is so good to see you,\" he said, and they sat down side by side. \"I\nam very glad to see you again.\"\n\nThen for a little while they sat in silence.\n\nMr. Brumley had imagined and rehearsed this meeting in many different\nmoods. Now, he found none of his premeditated phrases served him, and it\nwas the lady who undertook the difficult opening.\n\n\"I could not see you before,\" she began. \"I did not want to see anyone.\"\nShe sought to explain. \"I was strange. Even to myself. Suddenly----\" She\ncame to the point. \"To find oneself free.... Mr. Brumley,--_it was\nwonderful!_\"\n\nHe did not interrupt her and presently she went on again.\n\n\"You see,\" she said, \"I have become a human being----owning myself. I\nhad never thought what this change would be to me.... It has been----.\nIt has been--like being born, when one hadn't realized before that one\nwasn't born.... Now--now I can act. I can do this and that. I used to\nfeel as though I was on strings--with somebody able to pull.... There is\nno one now able to pull at me, no one able to thwart me....\"\n\nHer dark eyes looked among the trees and Mr. Brumley watched her\nprofile.\n\n\"It has been like falling out of a prison from which one never hoped to\nescape. I feel like a moth that has just come out of its case,--you know\nhow they come out, wet and weak but--released. For a time I feel I can\ndo nothing but sit in the sun.\"\n\n\"It's queer,\" she repeated, \"how one tries to feel differently from what\none really feels, how one tries to feel as one supposes people expect\none to feel. At first I hardly dared look at myself.... I thought I\nought to be sorrowful and helpless.... I am not in the least sorrowful\nor helpless....\n\n\"But,\" said Mr. Brumley, \"are you so free?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Altogether?\"\n\n\"As free now--as a man.\"\n\n\"But----people are saying in London----. Something about a will----.\"\n\nHer lips closed. Her brows and eyes became troubled. She seemed to\ngather herself together for an effort and spoke at length, without\nlooking at him. \"Mr. Brumley,\" she said, \"before I knew anything of the\nwill----. On the very evening when Isaac died----. I knew----I would\nnever marry again. Never.\"\n\nMr. Brumley did not stir. He remained regarding her with a mournful\nexpression.\n\n\"I was sure of it then,\" she said, \"I knew nothing about the will. I\nwant you to understand that--clearly.\"\n\nShe said no more. The still pause lengthened. She forced herself to meet\nhis eyes.\n\n\"I thought,\" he said after a silent scrutiny, and left her to imagine\nwhat he had thought....\n\n\"But,\" he urged to her protracted silence, \"you _care_?\"\n\nShe turned her face away. She looked at the hand lying idle upon her\ncrape-covered knee. \"You are my dearest friend,\" she said very softly.\n\"You are almost my only friend. But----. I can never go into marriage\nany more....\"\n\n\"My dear,\" he said, \"the marriage you have known----.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"No sort of marriage.\"\n\nMr. Brumley heaved a profound sigh.\n\n\"Before I had been a widow twenty-four hours, I began to realize that I\nwas an escaped woman. It wasn't the particular marriage.... It was any\nmarriage.... All we women are tied. Most of us are willing to be tied\nperhaps, but only as people are willing to be tied to life-belts in a\nwreck--from fear from drowning. And now, I am just one of the free\nwomen, like the women who can earn large incomes, or the women who\nhappen to own property. I've paid my penalties and my service is\nover.... I knew, of course, that you would ask me this. It isn't that I\ndon't care for you, that I don't love your company and your help--and\nthe love and the kindness....\"\n\n\"Only,\" he said, \"although it is the one thing I desire, although it is\nthe one return you can make me----. But whatever I have done--I have\ndone willingly....\"\n\n\"My dear!\" cried Mr. Brumley, breaking out abruptly at a fresh point, \"I\nwant you to marry me. I want you to be mine, to be my dear close\ncompanion, the care of my life, the beauty in my life.... I can't frame\nsentences, my dear. You know, you know.... Since first I saw you, talked\nto you in this very garden....\"\n\n\"I don't forget a thing,\" she answered. \"It has been my life as well as\nyours. Only----\"\n\nThe grip of her hand tightened on the back of their seat. She seemed to\nbe examining her thumb intently. Her voice sank to a whisper. \"I won't\nmarry you,\" she said.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a76\n\nMr. Brumley leant back, then he bent forward in a desperate attitude\nwith his hands and arms thrust between his knees, then suddenly he\nrecovered, stood up and then knelt with one knee upon the seat. \"What\nare you going to do with me then?\" he asked.\n\n\"I want you to go on being my friend.\"\n\n\"I can't.\"\n\n\"You can't?\"\n\n\"No,--I've _hoped_.\"\n\nAnd then with something almost querulous in his voice, he repeated, \"My\ndear, I want you to marry me and I want now nothing else in the world.\"\n\nShe was silent for a moment. \"Mr. Brumley,\" she said, looking up at him,\n\"have you no thought for our Hostels?\"\n\nMr. Brumley as I have said hated dilemmas. He started to his feet, a man\nstung. He stood in front of her and quivered extended hands at her.\n\"What do such things matter,\" he cried, \"when a man is in love?\"\n\nShe shrank a little from him. \"But,\" she asked, \"haven't they always\nmattered?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he expostulated; \"but these Hostels, these Hostels.... We've\nstarted them--isn't that good enough? We've set them going....\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" she asked, \"what would happen to the hostels if I were to\nmarry?\"\n\n\"They would go on,\" he said.\n\n\"They would go to a committee. Named. It would include Mrs. Pembrose....\nDon't you see what would happen? He understood the case so well....\"\n\nMr. Brumley seemed suddenly shrunken. \"He understood too well,\" he said.\n\nHe looked down at her soft eyes, at her drooping gracious form, and it\nseemed to him that indeed she was made for love and that it was\nunendurable that she should be content to think of friendship and\nfreedom as the ultimate purposes of her life....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a77\n\nPresently these two were walking in the pine-woods beyond the garden and\nMr. Brumley was discoursing lamentably of love, this great glory that\nwas denied them.\n\nThe shade of perplexity deepened in her dark eyes as she listened. Ever\nand again she seemed about to speak and then checked herself and let him\ntalk on.\n\nHe spoke of the closeness of love and the deep excitement of love and\nhow it filled the soul with pride and the world with wonder, and of the\nuniversal right of men and women to love. He told of his dreams and his\npatience, and of the stormy hopes that would not be suppressed when he\nheard that Sir Isaac was dead. And as he pictured to himself the lost\ndelights at which he hinted, as he called back those covert\nexpectations, he forgot that she had declared herself resolved upon\nfreedom at any cost, and his rage against Sir Isaac, who had possessed\nand wasted all that he would have cherished so tenderly, grew to nearly\nuncontrollable proportions. \"Here was your life,\" he said, \"your\nbeautiful life opening and full--full of such dear seeds of delight and\nwonder, calling for love, ready for love, and there came this _Clutch_,\nthis Clutch that embodied all the narrow meanness of existence, and\ngripped and crumpled you and spoilt you.... For I tell you my dear you\ndon't know; you don't begin to know....\"\n\nHe disregarded her shy eyes, giving way to his gathered wrath.\n\n\"And he conquers! This little monster of meanness, he conquers to the\nend--his dead hand, his dead desires, out of the grave they hold you!\nAlways, always, it is Clutch that conquers; the master of life! I was a\nfool to dream, a fool to hope. I forgot. I thought only of you and\nI--that perhaps you and I----\"\n\nHe did not heed her little sound of protest. He went on to a bitter\ndenunciation of the rule of jealousy in the world, forgetting that the\nsufferer under that rule in this case was his own consuming jealousy.\nThat was life. Life was jealousy. It was all made up of fierce\ngraspings, fierce suspicions, fierce resentments; men preyed upon one\nanother even as the beasts they came from; reason made its crushed way\nthrough their conflict, crippled and wounded by their blows at one\nanother. The best men, the wisest, the best of mankind, the stars of\nhuman wisdom, were but half ineffectual angels carried on the shoulders\nand guided by the steps of beasts. One might dream of a better world of\nmen, of civilizations and wisdom latent in our passion-strained minds,\nof calms and courage and great heroical conquests that might come, but\nthey lay tens of thousands of years away and we had to live, we had to\ndie, no more than a herd of beasts tormented by gleams of knowledge we\ncould never possess, of happiness for which we had no soul. He grew more\nand more eloquent as these thoughts sprang and grew in his mind.\n\n\"Of course I am absurd,\" he cried. \"All men are absurd. Man is the\nabsurd animal. We have parted from primordial motives--lust and hate and\nhunger and fear, and from all the tragic greatness of uncontrollable\nfate and we, we've got nothing to replace them. We are comic--comic!\nOurs is the stage of comedy in life's history, half lit and\nblinded,--and we fumble. As absurd as a kitten with its poor little head\nin a bag. There's your soul of man! Mewing. We're all at it, the poets,\nthe teachers. How can anyone hope to escape? Why should I escape? What\nam I that I should expect to be anything but a thwarted lover, a man\nmocked by his own attempts at service? Why should I expect to discover\nbeauty and think that it won't be snatched away from me? All my life is\ncomic--the story of this--this last absurdity could it make anything but\na comic history? and yet within me my heart is weeping tears. The\nfurther one has gone, the deeper one wallows in the comic marsh. I am\none of the newer kind of men, one of those men who cannot sit and hug\ntheir credit and their honour and their possessions and be content. I\nhave seen the light of better things than that, and because of my\nvision, because of my vision and for no other reason I am the most\nridiculous of men. Always I have tried to go out from myself to the\nworld and give. Those early books of mine, those meretricious books in\nwhich I pretended all was so well with the world,--I did them because I\nwanted to give happiness and contentment and to be happy in the giving.\nAnd all the watchers and the grippers, the strong silent men and the\ncalculating possessors of things, the masters of the world, they grinned\nat me. How I lied to please! But I tell you for all their grinning, in\nmy very prostitution there was a better spirit than theirs in their\nsuccesses. If I had to live over again----\"\n\nHe left that hypothesis uncompleted.\n\n\"And now,\" he said, with a curious contrast between his voice and the\nexaltation of his sentiments, \"now that I am to be your tormented, your\nemasculated lover to the very end of things, emasculated by laws I hate\nand customs I hate and vile foresights that I despise----\"\n\nHe paused, his thread lost for a moment.\n\n\"Because,\" he said, \"I'm going to do it. I'm going to do what I can. I'm\ngoing to be as you wish me to be, to help you, to serve you.... If you\ncan't come to meet me, I'll meet you. I can't help but love you, I\ncan't do without you. Never in my life have I subscribed willingly to\nthe idea of renunciation. I've hated renunciation. But if there is no\nother course but renunciation, renunciation let it be. I'm bitter about\nthis, bitter to the bottom of my soul, but at least I'll have you know I\nlove you. Anyhow....\"\n\nHis voice broke. There were tears in his eyes.\n\nAnd on the very crest of these magnificent capitulations his soul\nrebelled. He turned about so swiftly that for a sentence or so she did\nnot realize the nature of his change. Her mind remained glowing with her\ndistressed acceptance of his magnificent nobility.\n\n\"I can't,\" he said.\n\nHe flung off his surrenders as a savage might fling off a garment.\n\n\"When I think of his children,\" he said.\n\n\"When I think of the world filled by his children, the children you have\nborne him--and I--forbidden almost to touch your hand!\"\n\nAnd flying into a passion Mr. Brumley shouted \"No!\"\n\n\"Not even to touch your hand!\"\n\n\"I won't do it,\" he assured her. \"I won't do it. If I cannot be your\nlover--I will go away. I will never see you again. I will do\nanything--anything, rather than suffer this degradation. I will go\nabroad. I will go to strange places. I will aviate. I will kill\nmyself--or anything, but I won't endure this. I won't. You see, you ask\ntoo much, you demand more than flesh and blood can stand. I've done my\nbest to bring myself to it and I can't. I won't have that--that----\"\n\nHe waved his trembling fingers in the air. He was absolutely unable to\nfind an epithet pointed enough and bitter enough to stab into the memory\nof the departed knight. He thought of him as marble, enthroned at Kensal\nGreen, with a false dignity, a false serenity, and intolerable triumph.\nHe wanted something, some monosyllable to expound and strip all that,\nsome lung-filling sky-splitting monosyllable that one could shout. His\nfailure increased his exasperation.\n\n\"I won't have him grinning, at me,\" he said at last. \"And so, it's one\nthing or the other. There's no other choice. But I know your choice. I\nsee your choice. It's good-bye--and why--why shouldn't I go now?\"\n\nHe waved his arms about. He was pitifully ridiculous. His face puckered\nas an ill-treated little boy's might do. This time it wasn't just the\npathetic twinge that had broken his voice before; he found himself to\nhis own amazement on the verge of loud, undignified, childish weeping.\nHe was weeping passionately and noisily; he was over the edge of it, and\nit was too late to snatch himself back. The shame which could not\nconstrain him, overcame him. A preposterous upward gesture of the hands\nexpressed his despair. And abruptly this unhappy man of letters turned\nfrom her and fled, the most grief-routed of creatures, whooping and\nsobbing along a narrow pathway through the trees.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a78\n\nHe left behind him an exceedingly distressed and astonished lady. She\nhad stood with her eyes opening wider and wider at this culminating\nexhibition.\n\n\"But Mr. Brumley!\" she had cried at last. \"Mr. Brumley!\"\n\nHe did not seem to hear her. And now he was running and stumbling along\nvery fast through the trees, so that in a few minutes he would be out of\nsight. Dismay came with the thought that he might presently go out of\nsight altogether.\n\nFor a moment she seemed to hesitate. Then with a swift decision and a\nfirm large grasp of the hand, she gathered up her black skirts and set\noff after him along the narrow path. She ran. She ran lightly, with a\nsoft rhythmic fluttering of white and black. The long cr\u00c3\u00aape bands she\nwore in Sir Isaac's honour streamed out behind her.\n\n\"But Mr. Brumley,\" she panted unheard. \"Mister Brumley!\"\n\nHe went from her fast, faster than she could follow, amidst the\nsun-dappled pine stems, and as he went he made noises between bellowing\nand soliloquy, heedless of any pursuit. All she could hear was a\nheart-wringing but inexpressive \"Wa, wa, wooh, wa, woo,\" that burst from\nhim ever and again. Through a more open space among the trees she\nfancied she was gaining upon him, and then as the pines came together\nagain and were mingled with young spruces, she perceived that he drew\naway from her more and more. And he went round a curve and was hidden,\nand then visible again much further off, and then hidden----.\n\nShe attempted one last cry to him, but her breath failed her, and she\ndropped her pace to a panting walk.\n\nSurely he would not go thus into the high road! It was unendurable to\nthink of him rushing out into the high road--blind with sorrow--it might\nbe into the very bonnet of a passing automobile.\n\nShe passed beyond the pines and scanned the path ahead as far as the\nstile. Then she saw him, lying where he had flung himself, face downward\namong the bluebells.\n\n\"Oh!\" she whispered to herself, and put one hand to her heart and drew\nnearer.\n\nShe was flooded now with that passion of responsibility, with that wild\nirrational charity which pours out of the secret depths of a woman's\nstirred being.\n\nShe came up to him so lightly as to be noiseless. He did not move, and\nfor a moment she remained looking at him.\n\nThen she said once more, and very gently--\n\n\"Mr. Brumley.\"\n\nHe started, listened for a second, turned over, sat up and stared at\nher. His face was flushed and his hair extremely ruffled. And a slight\nmoisture recalled his weeping.\n\n\"Mr. Brumley,\" she repeated, and suddenly there were tears of honest\nvexation in her voice and eyes. \"You _know_ I cannot do without you.\"\n\nHe rose to his knees, and never, it seemed to him, had she looked so\nbeautiful. She was a little out of breath, her dusky hair was\ndisordered, and there was an unwonted expression in her eyes, a strange\nmingling of indignation and tenderness. For a moment they stared\nunaffectedly at each other, each making discoveries.\n\n\"Oh!\" he sighed at last; \"whatever you please, my dear. Whatever you\nplease. I'm going to do as you wish, if you wish it, and be your friend\nand forget all this\"--he waved an arm--\"loving.\"\n\nThere were signs of a recrudescence of grief, and, inarticulate as ever,\nshe sank to her knees close beside him.\n\n\"Let us sit quietly among these hyacinths,\" said Mr. Brumley. \"And then\nafterwards we will go back to the house and talk ... talk about our\nHostels.\"\n\nHe sat back and she remained kneeling.\n\n\"Of course,\" he said, \"I'm yours--to do just as you will with. And we'll\nwork----. I've been a bit of a stupid brute. We'll work. For all those\npeople. It will be--oh! a big work, quite a big work. Big enough for us\nto thank God for. Only----.\"\n\nThe sight of her panting lips had filled him with a wild desire, that\nset every nerve aquivering, and yet for all that had a kind of\nmoderation, a reasonableness. It was a sisterly thing he had in mind. He\nfelt that if this one desire could be satisfied, then honour would be\nsatisfied, that he would cease grudging Sir Isaac--anything....\n\nBut for some moments he could not force himself to speak of this desire,\nso great was his fear of a refusal.\n\n\"There's one thing,\" he said, and all his being seemed aquiver.\n\nHe looked hard at the trampled bluebells about their feet. \"Never once,\"\nhe went on, \"never once in all these years--have we two\neven--once--kissed.... It is such a little thing.... So much.\"\n\nHe stopped, breathless. He could say no more because of the beating of\nhis heart. And he dared not look at her face....\n\nThere was a swift, soft rustling as she moved....\n\nShe crouched down upon him and, taking his shoulder in her hand, upset\nhim neatly backwards, and, doing nothing by halves, had kissed the\nastonished Mr. Brumley full upon his mouth.\n\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nThe following pages contain advertisements of Macmillan books by the\nsame author, and new fiction.\n\n\n\n\nBY THE SAME AUTHOR\n\n\nThe War in the Air\n\n_Illustrated. 12mo. $1.50 net._\n\n\"It is not every man who can write a story of the improbable and make it\nappear probable, and yet that is what Mr. Wells has done in _The War in\nthe Air_.\"--_The Outlook._\n\n\"A more entertaining and original story of the future has probably never\nbeen written.\"--_Town and Country._\n\n\" ... displays that remarkable ingenuity for which Mr. Wells is now\nfamous.\"--_Washington Star._\n\n\"Forcible in the extreme.\"--_Baltimore Sun._\n\n\"It is an exciting tale, a novel military history.\"--_N.Y.

Cloth, 12mo. $1.35 net._\n\nEveryone who remembers _The Sea Wolf_ with pleasure will enjoy this\nvigorous narrative of a voyage from New York around Cape Horn in a large\nsailing vessel. _The Mutiny of the Elsinore_ is the same kind of tale as\nits famous predecessor, and by those who have read it, it is pronounced\neven more stirring. Mr. London is here writing of scenes and types of\npeople with which he is very familiar, the sea and ships and those who\nlive in ships. In addition to the adventure element, of which there is\nan abundance of the usual London kind, a most satisfying kind it is,\ntoo, there is a thread of romance involving a wealthy, tired young man\nwho takes the trip on the _Elsinore_, and the captain's daughter. The\nplay of incident, on the one hand the ship's amazing crew and on the\nother the lovers, gives a story in which the interest never lags and\nwhich demonstrates anew what a master of his art Mr. London is.\n\n\nThe Three Sisters\n\nBy MAY SINCLAIR, Author of \"The Divine Fire,\" \"The Return of the\nProdigal,\" etc.\n\n_Cloth, 12mo. $1.35 net._\n\nEvery reader of _The Divine Fire_, in fact every reader of any of Miss\nSinclair's books, will at once accord her unlimited praise for her\ncharacter work. _The Three Sisters_ reveals her at her best. It is a\nstory of temperament, made evident not through tiresome analyses but by\nmeans of a series of dramatic incidents. The sisters of the title\nrepresent three distinct types of womankind. In their reaction under\ncertain conditions Miss Sinclair is not only telling a story of\ntremendous interest but she is really showing a cross section of life.\n\n\nPUBLISHED BY\nTHE MACMILLAN COMPANY\n64-66 Fifth Avenue\nNew York\n\n\n\n\nNEW MACMILLAN FICTION\n\n\nThe Rise of Jennie Cushing\n\nBy MARY S. WATTS, Author of \"Nathan Burke,\" \"Van Cleeve,\" etc.\n\n_Cloth, 12mo. $1.35 net._\n\nIn _Nathan Burke_ Mrs. Watts told with great power the story of a man.\nIn this, her new book, she does much the same thing for a woman. Jennie\nCushing is an exceedingly interesting character, perhaps the most\ninteresting of any that Mrs. Watts has yet given us. The novel is her\nlife and little else, but it is a life filled with a variety of\nexperiences and touching closely many different strata of humankind.\nThroughout it all, from the days when as a thirteen-year-old, homeless,\nfriendless waif, Jennie is sent to a reformatory, to the days when her\nbeauty is the inspiration of a successful painter, there is in the\nnarrative an appeal to the emotions, to the sympathy, to the affections,\nthat cannot be gainsaid.\n\n\nSaturday's Child\n\nBy KATHLEEN NORRIS, Author of \"Mother,\" \"The Treasure,\" etc.\n\n_With frontispiece in colors by F. Graham Cootes. Decorated cloth,\n12mo. $1.35 net._\n\n\"_Friday's child is loving and giving,\nSaturday's child must work for her living._\"\n\nThe title of Mrs. Norris's new novel at once indicates its theme. It is\nthe story of a girl who has her own way to make in the world. The\nvarious experiences through which she passes, the various viewpoints\nwhich she holds until she comes finally to realize that service for\nothers is the only thing that counts, are told with that same intimate\nknowledge of character, that healthy optimism and the belief in the\nultimate goodness of mankind that have distinguished all of this\nauthor's writing. The book is intensely alive with human emotions. The\nreader is bound to sympathize with Mrs. Norris's people because they\nseem like _real_ people and because they are actuated by motives which\none is able to understand. _Saturday's Child_ is Mrs. Norris's longest\nwork. Into it has gone the very best of her creative talent. It is a\nvolume which the many admirers of _Mother_ will gladly accept.\n\n\nPUBLISHED BY\nTHE MACMILLAN COMPANY\n64-66 Fifth Avenue\nNew York\n\n\n\n\nNEW MACMILLAN FICTION\n\n\nThracian Sea\n\nA Novel by JOHN HELSTON, Author of \"Aphrodite,\" etc.\n\n_With frontispiece in colors. Decorated cloth, 12mo. $1.35 net._\n\nProbably no author to-day has written more powerfully or frankly on the\nconventions of modern society than John Helston, who, however, has\nhitherto confined himself to the medium of verse. In this novel, the\ntheme of which occasionally touches upon the same problems--problems\ninvolving love, freedom of expression, the right to live one's life in\none's own way--he is revealed to be no less a master of the prose form\nthan of the poetical. While the book is one for mature minds, the skill\nwith which delicate situations are handled and the reserve everywhere\nexhibited remove it from possible criticism even by the most exacting.\nThe title, it should be explained, refers to a spirited race horse with\nthe fortunes of which the lives of two of the leading characters are\nbound up.\n\n\nFaces in the Dawn\n\nA Story by HERMANN HAGEDORN\n\n_With frontispiece in colors. Cloth, 12mo. $1.35 net._\n\nA great many people already know Mr. Hagedorn through his verse. _Faces\nin the Dawn_ will, however, be their introduction to him as a novelist.\nThe same qualities that have served to raise his poetry above the common\nlevel help to distinguish this story of a German village. The theme of\nthe book is the transformation that was wrought in the lives of an\nirritable, domineering German pastor and his wife through the influence\nof a young German girl and her American lover. Sentiment, humor and a\nhuman feeling, all present in just the right measure, warm the heart and\ncontribute to the enjoyment which the reader derives in following the\nexperiences of the well drawn characters.\n\n\nPUBLISHED BY\nTHE MACMILLAN COMPANY\n64-66 Fifth Avenue\nNew York\n\n\n\n\nNEW MACMILLAN FICTION\n\n\nMetzel Changes His Mind\n\nBy RACHEL CAPEN SCHAUFFLER, Author of \"The Goodly Fellowship.\"\n\n_With frontispiece. Decorated cloth, 12mo. $1.25 net._\n\nThe many readers who enjoyed _The Goodly Fellowship_ have been eagerly\nawaiting something more from the pen of the same author. This is at last\nannounced. In _Metzel Changes His Mind_, Miss Schauffler strengthens the\nimpression made by her first book that she is a writer of marked\noriginality. Here again she has provided an unusual setting for her\ntale. The scene is largely laid in a pathological laboratory, surely a\nnew background for a romance. It is a background, moreover, which is\nused most effectively by Miss Schauffler in the furtherance of her plot.\nHer characters, too, are as interesting as their surroundings--a woman\ndoctor, attractive as well as sensible, a gruff old German doctor,\nsuspicious of womankind, and a young American. Around these the action\ncenters, though half a dozen others, vividly sketched, have a hand in\nthe proceedings. Of course _Metzel Changes His Mind_ is a love story,\nbut not of the ordinary type.\n\n\nLandmarks\n\nBy E.V. LUCAS, Author of \"Over Bemerton's,\" \"London Lavender,\" etc.\n\n_Cloth, 12mo. $1.35 net._\n\nMr. Lucas's new story combines a number of the most significant episodes\nin the life of the central figure; in other words, those events of his\ncareer from early childhood to the close of the book which have been\nmost instrumental in building up his character and experience. The\nepisodes are of every kind, serious, humorous, tender, awakening,\ndisillusioning, and they are narrated without any padding whatever, each\none beginning as abruptly as in life; although in none of his previous\nwork has the author been so minute in his social observation and\nnarration. A descriptive title precedes each episode, as in the\nmoving-picture; and it was in fact while watching a moving-picture that\nMr. Lucas had the idea of adapting its swift selective methods to\nfiction.\n\n\nPUBLISHED BY\nTHE MACMILLAN COMPANY\n64-66 Fifth Avenue\nNew York\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WIFE OF SIR ISAAC HARMAN***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 30855-8.txt or 30855-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/3\/0\/8\/5\/30855\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":765,"split":"train"}
