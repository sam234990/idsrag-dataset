{"ori_id":"d8e966a26d8054e3155ed4a4ade83b2bab83e95b","title":"Aunt Jane's Nieces Abroad","context":"Aunt Jane's Nieces Abroad\n The second book in the Aunt Jane's series picks up where the first left off. The eccentric and down-to-earth millionaire John Merrick decides to take his three beloved nieces \u2013 Patsy Doyle, Elizabeth de Graf, and Louise Merrick \u2013 on a tour of Europe. The parents of the three girls react variously, but don't oppose the trip; Mrs. Merrick, Louise's mother, wants to accompany them as chaperone, a prospect that Uncle John rejects out of hand. Still, Mrs. Merrick allows her daughter to go; she wants to separate Louise from Arthur Weldon, the young man who has been courting her. (The social-climbing Mrs. Merrick is desperate for Louise to land a rich husband. Weldon's father is a wealthy railroad magnate, but the father and son are in a clash of generations and the elder Weldon threatens to disown the younger).\nUncle John and the three cousins embark for Europe, and make new acquaintances aboard ship. Among them is a somewhat sinister and mysterious man called Victor Valdi, who combines \"refinement and barbarity\" in his manner. Patsy goes out of her way to draw him out of his sullen silence, to \"make him talk and 'be sociable'.\" The tourists reach Italy, where they witness an eruption by Vesuvius and cope with the public's fears and a layer of ash in the streets of Naples. They consider a detour, but decide to carry on intrepidly. They encounter a local aristocrat, the Count of Ferralti, who fancies Louise \u2013 though the clever Uncle John quickly realizes that he is only a pretend nobleman. John warns Louise of the young man's pretense, but otherwise allows the acquaintance, especially when Ferralti proves a courageous help in a near-disaster on the road.\nAt Taormina, the travelers meet Victor Valdi again; he appears more sinister and mysterious than ever in his native element, where he is called \"Il Duca.\" There is much talk of the danger of \"brigands\" in Sicily \u2014 though the local people cheerfully insist that \"There are no brigands\" in Sicily, an ironic refrain that winds through the book. Quickly enough, both Uncle John and Ferralti are waylaid by Valdi, who is the chief local brigand, and makes a living for his family and followers by kidnapping tourists and holding them for ransom. Uncle John learns the ways of Valdi's curious establishment, which includes his ruthless mother and his daughter Tato, who masquerades as a boy to serve as her father's henchman.\nAfter initial resistance, Uncle John reconciles himself to paying the ransom for his life and freedom; but his nieces and friends are unwilling to yield to bandits, and stage a bold and effective rescue of Uncle John and Ferralti. It is revealed that the false Count Ferralti is actually Arthur Weldon; he has come to Europe in disguise to be with Louise. Uncle John lets the two young people continue to see each other, as long as there is no talk of marriage yet. (News has arrived that Weldon's father has died in a railway accident, and that Arthur is now a wealthy heir.)\nThe Americans are surprised a few days later, when Valdi and Tato appear at their hotel. While Tato was acting as the go-between in the ransom plot, the girl and Patsy had become something like friends; with typical generosity of spirit, Patsy does not blame the girl for the actions of her family. Now, Valdi asks the Americans to take Tato under their charge for a time; Valdi is trying to leave brigandage behind and take up an honest life. The cousins naively accept Tato, and enjoy dressing her in a new wardrobe and teaching her manners. They are surprised again when Tato absconds with the ransom cash ($50,000 of Uncle John's money and $30,000 of Weldon's); the girl leaves a cheerful but mocking letter behind her, explaining the ruse.\nHaving learned their lesson, the travelers complete their tour through Italy, Switzerland, and France, and gratefully return home.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Aunt Jane's Nieces Abroad, by Edith Van Dyne\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Yet\nit is not necessary one should have read the first book to fully\nunderstand the present volume, the characters being taken to entirely\nnew scenes.\n\nThe various foreign localities are accurately described, so that those\nwho have visited them will recognize them at once, while those who have\nnot been so fortunate may acquire a clear conception of them. It was my\ngood fortune to be an eye witness of the recent great eruption of\nVesuvius.\n\nLest I be accused of undue sensationalism in relating the somewhat\ndramatic Sicilian incident, I will assure my reader that the story does\nnot exaggerate present conditions in various parts of the island. In\nfact, Il Duca and Tato are drawn from life, although they did not have\ntheir mountain lair so near to Taormina as I have ventured to locate\nit. Except that I have adapted their clever system of brigandage to the\nexigencies of this story, their history is truly related. Many who have\ntravelled somewhat outside the beaten tracks in Sicily will frankly\nvouch for this statement.\n\nItaly is doing its best to suppress the Mafia and to eliminate\nbrigandage from the beautiful islands it controls, but so few of the\ninhabitants are Italians or in sympathy with the government that the\nwork of reformation is necessarily slow. Americans, especially, must\nexercise caution in travelling in any part of Sicily; yet with proper\ncare not to tempt the irresponsible natives, they are as safe in Sicily\nas they are at home.\n\nAunt Jane's nieces are shown to be as frankly adventurous as the average\nclear headed American girl, but their experiences amid the environments\nof an ancient and still primitive civilization are in no wise\nextraordinary.\n\n     EDITH VAN DYNE.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE DOYLES ARE ASTONISHED\n\n\nIt was Sunday afternoon in Miss Patricia Doyle's pretty flat at 3708\nWilling Square. In the small drawing room Patricia--or Patsy, as she\npreferred to be called--was seated at the piano softly playing the one\n\"piece\" the music teacher had succeeded in drilling into her flighty\nhead by virtue of much patience and perseverance. In a thick cushioned\nmorris-chair reclined the motionless form of Uncle John, a chubby little\nman in a gray suit, whose features were temporarily eclipsed by the\nnewspaper that was spread carefully over them. Occasionally a gasp or a\nsnore from beneath the paper suggested that the little man was\n\"snoozing\" as he sometimes gravely called it, instead of listening to\nthe music.\n\nMajor Doyle sat opposite, stiffly erect, with his admiring eyes full\nupon Patsy. At times he drummed upon the arms of his chair in unison\nwith the music, nodding his grizzled head to mark the time as well as to\nemphasize his evident approbation. Patsy had played this same piece from\nstart to finish seven times since dinner, because it was the only one\nshe knew; but the Major could have listened to it seven hundred times\nwithout the flicker of an eyelash. It was not that he admired so much\nthe \"piece\" the girl was playing as the girl who was playing the\n\"piece.\" His pride in Patsy was unbounded. That she should have\nsucceeded at all in mastering that imposing looking instrument--making\nit actually \"play chunes\"--was surely a thing to wonder at. But then,\nPatsy could do anything, if she but tried.\n\nSuddenly Uncle John gave a dreadful snort and sat bolt upright, gazing\nat his companions with a startled look that melted into one of benign\ncomplacency as he observed his surroundings and realized where he was.\nThe interruption gave Patsy an opportunity to stop playing the tune. She\nswung around on the stool and looked with amusement at her newly\nawakened uncle.\n\n\"You've been asleep,\" she said.\n\n\"No, indeed; quite a mistake,\" replied the little man, seriously. \"I've\nonly been thinking.\"\n\n\"An' such _beaut_chiful thoughts,\" observed the Major, testily, for he\nresented the interruption of his Sunday afternoon treat. \"You thought\n'em aloud, sir, and the sound of it was a bad imithation of a bullfrog\nin a marsh. You'll have to give up eating the salad, sir.\"\n\n\"Bah! don't I know?\" asked Uncle John, indignantly.\n\n\"Well, if your knowledge is better than our hearing, I suppose you do,\"\nretorted the Major. \"But to an ignorant individual like meself the\nimpression conveyed was that you snored like a man that has forgotten\nhis manners an' gone to sleep in the prisence of a lady.\"\n\n\"Then no one has a better right to do that,\" declared Patsy, soothingly;\n\"and I'm sure our dear Uncle John's thoughts were just the most\nbeautiful dreams in the world. Tell us of them, sir, and we'll prove the\nMajor utterly wrong.\"\n\nEven her father smiled at the girl's diplomacy, and Uncle John, who was\non the verge of unreasonable anger, beamed upon her gratefully.\n\n\"I'm going to Europe,\" he said.\n\nThe Major gave an involuntary start, and then turned to look at him\ncuriously.\n\n\"And I'm going to take Patsy along,\" he continued, with a mischievous\ngrin.\n\nThe Major frowned.\n\n\"Conthrol yourself, sir, until you are fully awake,\" said he. \"You're\ndreaming again.\"\n\nPatsy swung her feet from side to side, for she was such a little thing\nthat the stool raised her entirely off the floor. There was a thoughtful\nlook on her round, freckled face, and a wistful one in her great blue\neyes as the full meaning of Uncle John's abrupt avowal became apparent.\n\nThe Major was still frowning, but a half frightened expression had\nreplaced the one of scornful raillery. For he, too, knew that his\neccentric brother-in-law was likely to propose any preposterous thing,\nand then carry it out in spite of all opposition. But to take Patsy to\nEurope would be like pulling the Major's eye teeth or amputating his\ngood right arm. Worse; far worse! It would mean taking the sunshine out\nof her old father's sky altogether, and painting it a grim, despairing\ngray.\n\nBut he resolved not to submit without a struggle.\n\n\"Sir,\" said he, sternly--he always called his brother-in-law \"sir\" when\nhe was in a sarcastic or reproachful mood--\"I've had an idea for some\ntime that you were plotting mischief. You haven't looked me straight in\nthe eye for a week, and you've twice been late to dinner. I will ask you\nto explain to us, sir, the brutal suggestion you have just advanced.\"\n\nUncle John laughed. In the days when Major Doyle had thought him a poor\nman and in need of a helping hand, the grizzled old Irishman had been as\ntender toward him as a woman and studiously avoided any speech or\nepithet that by chance might injure the feelings of his dead wife's\nonly brother. But the Major's invariable courtesy to the poor or\nunfortunate was no longer in evidence when he found that John Merrick\nwas a multi-millionaire with a strongly defined habit of doing good to\nothers and striving in obscure and unconventional ways to make everybody\naround him happy. His affection for the little man increased mightily,\nbut his respectful attitude promptly changed, and a chance to reprove or\ndiscomfit his absurdly rich brother-in-law was one of his most\nsatisfactory diversions. Uncle John appreciated this, and holding the\ndignified Major in loving regard was glad to cross swords with him now\nand then to add variety to their pleasant relations.\n\n\"It's this way, Major Doyle,\" he now remarked, coolly. \"I've been\nworried to death, lately, over business matters; and I need a change.\"\n\n\"Phoo! All your business is attended to by Isham, Marvin & Co. You've no\nworry at all. Why, we've just made you a quarter of a million in C.H. &\nD's.\"\n\nThe \"we\" is explained by stating that the Major held an important\nposition in the great banking house--a position Mr. Merrick had secured\nfor him some months previously.\n\n\"That's it!\" said Uncle John. \"You've made me a quarter of a million\nthat I don't want. The C.H. & D. stocks were going to pieces when I\nbought them, and I had reason to hope I'd lose a good round sum on them.\nBut the confounded luck turned, and the result is an accumulation of all\nthis dreadful money. So, my dear Major, before I'm tempted to do\nsome-other foolish thing I've determined to run away, where business\ncan't follow me, and where by industry and perseverance I can scatter\nsome of my ill-gotten gains.\"\n\nThe Major smiled grimly.\n\n\"That's Europe, right enough,\" he said. \"And I don't object, John, to\nyour going there whenever you please. You're disgracefully countryfied\nand uninformed for a man of means, and Europe'll open your eyes and\nprove to you how insignificant you really are. I advise you to visit\nIreland, sor, which I'm reliably informed is the centhral jewel in\nEurope's crown of beauty. Go; and go whinever you please, sor; but\nforbear the wickedness of putting foolish thoughts into our Patsy's\nsweet head. She can't go a step, and you know it. It's positive cruelty\nto her, sir, to suggest such a thing!\"\n\nThe Major's speech had a touch of the brogue when he became excited, but\nrecovered when he calmed down.\n\n\"Why, you selfish old humbug!\" cried Uncle John, indignantly. \"Why can't\nshe go, when there's money and time to spare? Would you keep her here to\ncuddle and spoil a vigorous man like yourself, when she can run away and\nsee the world and be happy?\"\n\n\"It's a great happiness to cuddle the Major,\" said Patsy, softly; \"and\nthe poor man needs it as much as he does his slippers or his oatmeal for\nbreakfast.\"\n\n\"And Patsy has the house to look after,\" added the Major, complacently.\n\nUncle John gave a snort of contempt.\n\n\"For an unreasonable man, show me an Irishman,\" he remarked. \"Here\nyou've been telling me how Europe is an education and a delight, and in\nthe next breath you deliberately deprive your little daughter, whom you\npretend to love, of the advantages she might gain by a trip abroad! And\nwhy? Just because you want her yourself, and might be a bit lonesome\nwithout her. But I'll settle that foolishness, sir, in short order. You\nshall go with us.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" ejaculated the Major. \"It's the time of year I'm most\nneeded in the office, and Mr. Marvin has been so kind and considerate\nthat I won't play him a dirty trick by leaving him in the lurch.\"\n\nPatsy nodded approval.\n\n\"That's right, daddy,\" she said.\n\nUncle John lay back in the chair and put the newspaper over his face\nagain. Patsy and her father stared at one another with grave intentness.\nThen the Major drew out his handkerchief and mopped his brow.\n\n\"You'd like to go, mavourneen?\" he asked, softly.\n\n\"Yes, daddy; but I won't, of course.\"\n\n\"Tut-tut! don't you go putting yourself against your old father's will,\nPatsy. It's not so far to Europe,\" he continued, thoughtfully, \"and you\nwon't be away much longer than you were when you went to Elmhurst after\nAunt Jane's money--which you didn't get. Mary takes fine care of our\nlittle rooms, and doubtless I shall be so busy that I won't miss you at\nall, at all.\"\n\n\"Daddy!\"\n\nShe was in his lap, now, her chubby arms clasped around his neck and her\nsoft cheek laid close beside his rough and ruddy one.\n\n\"And when ye get back, Patsy darlin',\" he whispered, tenderly stroking\nher hair, \"the joy of the meeting will make up for all that we've\nsuffered. It's the way of life, mavourneen. Unless a couple happens to\nbe Siamese twins, they're bound to get separated in the course of\nevents, more or less, if not frequently.\"\n\n\"I won't go, daddy.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes you will. It's not like you to be breakin' my heart by stayin'\nhome. Next week, said that wicked old uncle--he remoinds me of the one\nthat tried to desthroy the Babes in the Woods, Patsy dear. You must try\nto reclaim him to humanity, for I'm hopin' there's a bit of good in the\nold rascal yet.\" And he looked affectionately at the round little man\nunder the newspaper.\n\nUncle John emerged again. It was wonderful how well he understood the\nDoyle family. His face was now smiling and wore a look of supreme\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"Your selfishness, my dear Major,\" said he, \"is like the husk on a\ncocoanut. When you crack it there's plenty of milk within--and in your\ncase it's the milk of human kindness. Come! let's talk over the trip.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nUNCLE JOHN MAKES PLANS\n\n\n\"The thought came to me a long time ago,\" Uncle John resumed; \"but it\nwas only yesterday that I got all the details fixed and settled in my\nmind. I've been a rough old duffer, Patsy, and in all my hard working\nlife never thought of such a thing as travelling or enjoying myself\nuntil I fell in with you, and you taught me how pleasant it is to\nscatter sunshine in the hearts of others. For to make others happy means\na lot of joy for yourself--a secret you were trying to keep from me, you\ncrafty young woman, until I discovered it by accident. Now, here I am\nwith three nieces on my hands--\"\n\n\"You may say two, sir,\" interrupted the Major. \"Patsy can take care of\nherself.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue,\" said Uncle John. \"I say I've got three nieces--as\nfine a trio of intelligent, sweet and attractive young women as you'll\nrun across in a month of Sundays. I dare you to deny it, sir. And they\nare all at an age when an European trip will do them a world of good. So\noff we go, a week from Tuesday, in the first-class steamer 'Princess\nIrene,' bound from New York for the Bay of Naples!\"\n\nPatsy's eyes showed her delight. They fairly danced.\n\n\"Have you told Beth and Louise?\" she asked.\n\nHis face fell.\n\n\"Not yet,\" he said. \"I'd forgotten to mention it to them.\"\n\n\"For my part,\" continued the girl, \"I can get ready in a week, easily.\nBut Beth is way out in Ohio, and we don't know whether she can go or\nnot.\"\n\n\"I'll telegraph her, and find out,\" said Uncle John.\n\n\"Do it to-day,\" suggested the Major.\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"And to-morrow you must see Louise,\" added Patsy. \"I'm not sure she'll\nwant to go, dear. She's such a social butterfly, you know, that her\nengagements may keep her at home.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say she's engaged?\" asked Mr. Merrick, aghast.\n\n\"Only for the parties and receptions, Uncle. But it wouldn't surprise me\nif she was married soon. She's older than Beth or me, and has a host of\nadmirers.\"\n\n\"Perhaps she's old enough to be sensible,\" suggested the Major.\n\n\"Well, I'll see her and her mother to-morrow morning,\" decided Uncle\nJohn, \"and if she can't find time for a trip to Europe at my expense,\nyou and Beth shall go anyhow--and we'll bring Louise a wedding present.\"\n\nWith this declaration he took his hat and walking stick and started for\nthe telegraph station, leaving Patsy and her father to canvass the\nunexpected situation.\n\nJohn Merrick was sixty years old, but as hale and rugged as a boy of\ntwenty. He had made his vast fortune on the Pacific Coast and during his\nyears of busy activity had been practically forgotten by the Eastern\nmembers of his family, who never had credited him with sufficient\nability to earn more than a precarious livelihood. But the man was\nshrewd enough in a business way, although simple almost to childishness\nin many other matters. When he returned, quite unheralded, to end his\ndays \"at home\" and employ his ample wealth to the best advantage, he for\na time kept his success a secret, and so learned much of the\ndispositions and personal characteristics of his three nieces.\n\nThey were at that time visiting his unmarried sister, Jane, at her\nestate at Elmhurst, whither they had been invited for the first time;\nand in the race for Aunt Jane's fortune he watched the three girls\ncarefully and found much to admire in each one of them. Patsy Doyle,\nhowever, proved exceptionally frank and genuine, and when Aunt Jane at\nlast died and it was found she had no estate to bequeath, Patsy proved\nthe one bright star in the firmament of disappointment. Supposing Uncle\nJohn to be poor, she insisted upon carrying him to New York with her and\nsharing with him the humble tenement room in which she lived with her\nfather--a retired veteran who helped pay the family expenses by keeping\nbooks for a mercantile firm, while Patsy worked in a hair-dresser's\nshop.\n\nIt was now that Uncle John proved a modern fairy godfather to Aunt\nJane's nieces--who were likewise his own nieces. The three girls had\nlittle in common except their poverty, Elizabeth De Graf being the\ndaughter of a music teacher, in Cloverton, Ohio, while Louise Merrick\nlived with her widowed mother in a social atmosphere of the second class\nin New York, where the two women frankly intrigued to ensnare for Louise\na husband who had sufficient means to ensure both mother and daughter a\ncomfortable home. In spite of this worldly and unlovely ambition, which\ntheir circumstances might partially excuse, Louise, who was but\nseventeen, had many good and womanly qualities, could they have been\ndeveloped in an atmosphere uninfluenced by the schemes of her vain and\nselfish mother.\n\nUncle John, casting aside the mask of poverty, came to the relief of all\nthree girls. He settled the incomes of substantial sums of money upon\nboth Beth and Louise, making them practically independent. For Patsy he\nbought a handsome modern flat building located at 3708 Willing Square,\nand installed her and the Major in its cosiest apartment, the rents of\nthe remaining flats giving the Doyles an adequate income for all time to\ncome. Here Uncle John, believing himself cordially welcome, as indeed he\nwas, made his own home, and it required no shrewd guessing to arrive at\nthe conclusion that little Patsy was destined to inherit some day all\nhis millions.\n\nThe great banking and brokerage firm of Isham, Marvin & Co. had long\nmanaged successfully John Merrick's vast fortune, and at his\nsolicitation it gave Major Doyle a responsible position in its main\noffice, with a salary that rendered him independent of his daughter's\nsuddenly acquired wealth and made him proud and self-respecting.\n\nMoney had no power to change the nature of the Doyles. The Major\nremained the same simple, honest, courteous yet brusque old warrior who\nhad won Uncle John's love as a hard working book-keeper; and Patsy's\nbright and sunny disposition had certain power to cheer any home,\nwhether located in a palace or a hovel.\n\nNever before in his life had Uncle John been so supremely happy, and\nnever before had Aunt Jane's three nieces had so many advantages and\npleasures. It was to confer still further benefits upon these girls that\ntheir eccentric uncle had planned this unexpected European trip.\n\nHis telegram to Elizabeth was characteristic:\n\n\"Patsy, Louise and I sail for Europe next Tuesday. Will you join us as\nmy guest? If so, take first train to New York, where I will look after\nyour outfit. Answer immediately.\"\n\nThat was a message likely to surprise a country girl, but it did not\nstrike John Merrick as in any way extraordinary. He thought he could\ndepend upon Beth. She would be as eager to go as he was to have her, and\nwhen he had paid for the telegram he dismissed the matter from further\nthought.\n\nNext morning Patsy reminded him that instead of going down town he must\npersonally notify Louise Merrick of the proposed trip; so he took a\ncross-town line and arrived at the Merrick's home at nine o'clock.\n\nMrs. Merrick was in a morning wrapper, sipping her coffee in an upper\nroom. But she could not deny herself to Uncle John, her dead husband's\nbrother and her only daughter's benefactor (which meant indirectly her\nown benefactor), so she ordered the maid to show him up at once.\n\n\"Louise is still sweetly sleeping,\" she said, \"and won't waken for hours\nyet.\"\n\n\"Is anything wrong with her?\" he asked, anxiously.\n\n\"Oh, dear, no! but everyone does not get up with the milkman, as you do,\nJohn; and the dear child was at the opera last night, which made her\nlate in getting home.\"\n\n\"Doesn't the opera let out before midnight, the same as the theatres?\"\nhe asked.\n\n\"I believe so; but there is the supper, afterward, you know.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" he returned, thoughtfully. \"I've always noticed that the\nopera makes folks desperately hungry, for they flock to the restaurants\nas soon as they can get away. Singular, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Why, I never thought of it in that light.\"\n\n\"But Louise is well?\"\n\n\"Quite well, thank you.\"\n\n\"That's a great relief, for I'm going to take her to Europe with me next\nweek,\" he said.\n\nMrs. Merrick was so astonished that she nearly dropped her coffee-cup\nand could make no better reply than to stare blankly at her\nbrother-in-law.\n\n\"We sail Tuesday,\" continued Uncle John, \"and you must have my niece\nready in time and deliver her on board the 'Princess Irene' at Hoboken\nat nine o'clock, sharp.\"\n\n\"But John--John!\" gasped Mrs. Merrick, feebly, \"it will take a month, at\nleast, to make her gowns, and--\"\n\n\"Stuff and rubbish!\" he growled. \"That shows, Martha, how little you\nknow about European trips. No one makes gowns to go abroad with; you buy\n'em in Paris to bring home.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; to be sure,\" she muttered. \"Perhaps, then, it can be done, if\nLouise, has no other engagements.\"\n\n\"Just what Patsy said. See here, Martha, do you imagine that any girl\nwho is half human could have engagements that would keep her from\nEurope?\"\n\n\"But the requirements of society--\"\n\n\"You'll get me riled, pretty soon, Martha; and if you do you'll wish you\nhadn't.\"\n\nThis speech frightened the woman. It wouldn't do to provoke Uncle John,\nhowever unreasonable he happened to be. So she said, meekly:\n\n\"I've no doubt Louise will be delighted to go, and so will I.\"\n\n\"You!\"\n\n\"Why--why--whom do you intend taking?\"\n\n\"Just the three girls--Aunt Jane's three nieces. Also mine.\"\n\n\"But you'll want a chaperone for them.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Propriety requires it; and so does ordinary prudence. Louise, I know,\nwill be discreet, for it is her nature; but Patsy is such a little\nflyaway and Beth so deep and demure, that without a chaperone they might\ncause you a lot of trouble.\"\n\nUncle John grew red and his eyes flashed.\n\n\"A chaperone!\" he cried, contemptuously; \"not any in mine, Martha\nMerrick. Either we young folks go alone, without any death's head to\nperpetually glower at us, or we don't go at all! Three better girls\nnever lived, and I'll trust 'em anywhere. Besides that, we aren't going\nto any of your confounded social functions; we're going on a reg'lar\npicnic, and if I don't give those girls the time of their lives my name\nain't John Merrick. A chaperone, indeed!\"\n\nMrs. Merrick held up her hands in horror.\n\n\"I'm not sure, John,\" she gasped, \"that I ought to trust my dear child\nwith an uncle who disregards so openly the proprieties.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm sure; and the thing's settled,\" he said, more calmly. \"Don't\nworry, ma'am. I'll look after Patsy and Beth, and Louise will look after\nall of us--just as she does after you--because she's so discreet. Talk\nabout your being a chaperone! Why, you don't dare say your soul's your\nown when Louise is awake. That chaperone business is all\nhumbuggery--unless an old uncle like me can be a chaperone. Anyhow, I'm\nthe only one that's going to be appointed. I won't wait for Louise to\nwake up. Just tell her the news and help her to get ready on time. And\nnow, I'm off. Good morning, Martha.\"\n\nShe really had no words of protest ready at hand, and it was long after\nqueer old John Merrick had gone away that she remembered a dozen\neffective speeches that she might have delivered.\n\n\"After all,\" she sighed, taking up her cup again, \"it may be the best\nthing in the world for Louise. We don't know whether that young Weldon,\nwho is paying her attentions just now, is going to inherit his father's\nmoney or not. He's been a bit wild, I've heard, and it is just as well\nto postpone any engagement until we find out the facts. I can do that\nnicely while my sweet child is in Europe with Uncle John, and away from\nall danger of entanglements. Really, it's an ill wind that blows no\ngood! I'll go talk with Louise.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\"ALL ASHORE\"\n\n\nBeth De Graf was a puzzle to all who knew her. She was a puzzle even to\nherself, and was wont to say, indifferently, that the problem was not\nworth a solution. For this beautiful girl of fifteen was somewhat bitter\nand misanthropic, a condition perhaps due to the uncongenial atmosphere\nin which she had been reared. She was of dark complexion and her big\nbrown eyes held a sombre and unfathomable expression. Once she had\nsecretly studied their reflection in a mirror, and the eyes awed and\nfrightened her, and made her uneasy. She had analyzed them much as if\nthey belonged to someone else, and wondered what lay behind their mask,\nand what their capabilities might be.\n\nBut this morbid condition mostly affected her when she was at home,\nlistening to the unpleasant bickerings of her father and mother, who\nquarrelled constantly over trifles that Beth completely ignored. Her\nparents seemed like two ill tempered animals confined in the same cage,\nshe thought, and their snarls had long since ceased to interest her.\n\nThis condition had, of course, been infinitely worse in all those\ndreadful years when they were poverty stricken. Since Uncle John had\nsettled a comfortable income on his niece the grocer was paid promptly\nand Mrs. De Graf wore a silk dress on Sundays and held her chin a little\nhigher than any other of the Cloverton ladies dared do. The Professor,\nno longer harrassed by debts, devoted less time to the drudgery of\nteaching and began the composition of an oratorio that he firmly\nbelieved would render his name famous. So, there being less to quarrel\nabout, Beth's parents indulged more moderately in that pastime; but\ntheir natures were discordant, and harmony in the De Graf household was\nimpossible.\n\nWhen away from home Beth's disposition softened. Some of her\nschool-friends had seen her smile--a wonderful and charming phenomenon,\nduring which her expression grew sweet and bewitchingly animated and her\nbrown eyes radiant with mirthful light. It was not the same Beth at all.\n\nSometimes, when the nieces were all at Aunt Jane's, Beth had snuggled in\nthe arms of her cousin Louise, who had a way of rendering herself\nagreeable to all with whom she came in contact, and tried hard to win\nthe affection of the frankly antagonistic girl. At such times the\ngentleness of Elizabeth, her almost passionate desire to be loved and\nfondled, completely transformed her for the moment. Louise, shrewd at\nreading others, told herself that Beth possessed a reserve force of\ntenderness, amiability and fond devotion that would render her adorable\nif she ever allowed those qualities full expression. But she did not\ntell Beth that. The girl was so accustomed to despise herself and so\nsuspicious of any creditable impulses that at times unexpectedly\nobtruded themselves, that she would have dismissed such a suggestion as\narrant flattery, and Louise was clever enough not to wish to arouse her\ncousin to a full consciousness of her own possibilities.\n\nThe trained if not native indifference of this strange girl of fifteen\nwas demonstrated by her reception of Uncle John's telegram. She quietly\nhanded it to her mother and said, as calmly as if it were an invitation\nto a church picnic:\n\n\"I think I shall go.\"\n\n\"Nothing like that ever happened to me,\" remarked Mrs. De Graf,\nenviously. \"If John Merrick had an atom of common sense he'd have taken\nme to Europe instead of a troop of stupid school girls. But John always\nwas a fool, and always will be. When will you start, Beth?\"\n\n\"To-morrow morning. There's nothing to keep me. I'll go to Patsy and\nstay with her until we sail.\"\n\n\"Are you glad?\" asked her mother, looking into the expressionless face\nhalf curiously.\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Beth, as if considering her reply; \"a change is always\ninteresting, and I have never travelled except to visit Aunt Jane at\nElmhurst. So I think I am pleased to go to Europe.\"\n\nMrs. De Graf sighed. There was little in common between mother and\ndaughter; but that, to a grave extent, was the woman's fault. She had\nnever tried to understand her child's complex nature, and somewhat\nresented Beth's youth and good looks, which she considered contrasted\nunfavorably with her own deepening wrinkles and graying hair. For Mrs.\nDe Graf was vain and self-important, and still thought herself\nattractive and even girlish. It would really be a relief to have Beth\nout of the way for a few months.\n\nThe girl packed her own trunk and arranged for it to be taken to the\nstation. In the morning she entered the music room to bid the Professor\ngood-bye. He frowned at the interruption, for the oratorio was\nespecially engrossing at the time. Mrs. De Graf kissed her daughter\nlightly upon the lips and said in a perfunctory way that she hoped Beth\nwould have a good time.\n\nThe girl had no thought of resenting the lack of affection displayed by\nher parents. It was what she had always been accustomed to, and she had\nno reason to expect anything different.\n\nPatsy met her at the train in New York and embraced her rapturously.\nPatsy was really fond of Beth; but it was her nature to be fond of\neveryone, and her cousin, escaping from her smacking and enthusiastic\nkisses, told herself that Patsy would have embraced a cat with the same\nspontaneous ecstacy. That was not strictly true, but there was nothing\nhalf hearted or halfway about Miss Doyle. If she loved you, there would\nnever be an occasion for you to doubt the fact. It was Patsy's way.\n\nUncle John also was cordial in his greetings. He was very proud of his\npretty niece, and discerning enough to realize there was a broad strata\nof womanliness somewhere in Elizabeth's undemonstrative character. He\nhad promised himself to \"dig it out\" some day, and perhaps the European\ntrip would give him his opportunity.\n\nPatsy and Elizabeth shopped for the next few days most strenuously and\ndelightfully. Sometimes their dainty cousin Louise joined them, and the\nthree girls canvassed gravely their requirements for a trip that was as\nnew to them as a flight to the moon. Naturally, they bought much that\nwas unnecessary and forgot many things that would have been useful. You\nhave to go twice to Europe to know what to take along.\n\nLouise needed less than the others, for her wardrobe was more extensive\nand she already possessed all that a young girl could possibly make use\nof. This niece, the eldest of Uncle John's trio, was vastly more\nexperienced in the ways of the world than the others, although as a\ntraveller she had no advantage of them. Urged thereto by her worldly\nmother, she led a sort of trivial, butterfly existence, and her\ncharacter was decidedly superficial to any close observer. Indeed, her\nvery suavity and sweetness of manner was assumed, because it was so much\nmore comfortable and effective to be agreeable than otherwise. She was\nnow past seventeen years of age, tall and well formed, with a delicate\nand attractive face which, without being beautiful, was considered\npleasant and winning. Her eyes were good, though a bit too shrewd, and\nher light brown hair was fluffy as spun silk. Graceful of carriage,\ngracious of manner, yet affecting a languor unsuited to her years,\nLouise Merrick was a girl calculated to draw from the passing throng\nglances of admiration and approval, and to convey the impression of good\nbreeding and feminine cleverness.\n\nAll this, however, was outward. Neither Patsy nor Beth displayed any\nundue affection for their cousin, although all of the girls exhibited a\nfair amount of cousinly friendship for one another. They had once been\nthrown together under trying circumstances, when various qualities of\ntemperament not altogether admirable were liable to assert themselves.\nThose events were too recent to be already forgotten, yet the girls were\ngenerous enough to be considerate of each others' failings, and had\nresolved to entertain no sentiment other than good will on the eve of\ntheir departure for such a charming outing as Uncle John had planned for\nthem.\n\nMr. Merrick being a man, saw nothing radically wrong in the dispositions\nof any of his nieces. Their youth and girlishness appealed to him\nstrongly, and he loved to have them by his side. It is true that he\nsecretly regretted Louise was not more genuine, that Beth was so\ncynical and frank, and that Patsy was not more diplomatic. But he\nreflected that he had had no hand in molding their characters, although\nhe might be instrumental in improving them; so he accepted the girls as\nthey were, thankful that their faults were not glaring, and happy to\nhave found three such interesting nieces to cheer his old age.\n\nAt last the preparations were complete. Tuesday arrived, and Uncle John\n\"corralled his females,\" as he expressed it, and delivered them safely\non board the staunch and comfortable ocean greyhound known as the\n\"Princess Irene,\" together with their bags and baggage, their flowers\nand fruits and candy boxes and all those other useless accessories to a\nvoyage so eagerly thrust upon the departing travellers by their\naffectionate but ill-advised friends.\n\nMrs. Merrick undertook the exertion of going to Hoboken to see her\ndaughter off, and whispered in the ear of Louise many worldly\nadmonitions and such bits of practical advice as she could call to mind\non the spur of the moment.\n\nMajor Gregory Doyle was there, pompous and straight of form and wearing\nan assumed smile that was meant to assure Patsy he was delighted at her\ngoing, but which had the effect of scaring the girl because she at first\nthought the dreadful expression was due to convulsions.\n\nThe Major had no admonitions for Patsy, but she had plenty for him, and\ngave him a long list of directions that would, as he said, cause him to\n\"walk mighty sthraight\" if by good luck he managed to remember them all.\n\nHaving made up his mind to let the child go to Europe, the old fellow\nallowed no wails or bemoanings to reach Patsy's ears to deprive her of a\nmoment's joyful anticipation of the delights in store for her. He\nlaughed and joked perpetually during that last day, and promised the\ngirl that he would take a vacation while she was gone and visit his old\ncolonel in Virginia, which she knew was the rarest pleasure he could\nenjoy. And now he stood upon the deck amusing them all with his quaint\nsayings and appearing so outwardly jolly and unaffected that only Patsy\nherself suspected the deep grief that was gripping his kindly old\nheart.\n\nUncle John guessed, perhaps, for he hugged the Major in a tight embrace,\nwhispering that Patsy should be now, as ever, the apple of his eye and\nthe subject of his most loving care.\n\n\"An' don't be forgetting to bring me the meerschaum pipe from Sicily an'\nthe leathern pocket-book from Florence,\" the Major said to Patsy,\nimpressively. \"It's little enough for ye to remember if ye go that way,\nan' to tell the truth I'm sending ye abroad just for to get them. An'\ndon't be gettin' off the boat till it stops at a station; an' remember\nthat Uncle John is full of rheumatics an' can't walk more n' thirty mile\nan hour, an'--\"\n\n\"It's a slander,\" said Uncle John, stoutly. \"I never had rheumatics in\nmy life.\"\n\n\"Major,\" observed Patsy, her blue eyes full of tears but her lips trying\nto smile, \"do have the tailor sponge your vest every Saturday. It's full\nof spots even now, and I've been too busy lately to look after you\nproperly. You're--you're--just disgraceful, Major!\"\n\n\"All ashore!\" called a loud voice.\n\nThe Major gathered Patsy into an embrace that threatened to crush her,\nand then tossed her into Uncle John's arms and hurried away. Mrs.\nMerrick followed, with good wishes for all for a pleasant journey; and\nthen the four voyagers pressed to the rail and waved their handkerchiefs\nfrantically to those upon the dock while the band played vociferously\nand the sailors ran here and there in sudden excitement and the great\nship left her moorings and moved with proud deliberation down the bay to\nbegin her long voyage to Gibraltar and the blue waters of the\nMediterranean.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nSOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES, AND A WARNING\n\n\nFor an inexperienced tourist Uncle John managed their arrangements most\nadmirably. He knew nothing at all about ocean travel or what was the\nproper method to secure comfortable accommodations; but while most of\nthe passengers were writing hurried letters in the second deck gallery,\nwhich were to be sent back by the pilot, Mr. Merrick took occasion to\ninterview the chief steward and the deck steward and whatever other\nofficial he could find, and purchased their good will so liberally that\nthe effect of his astute diplomacy was immediately apparent.\n\nHis nieces found that the sunniest deck chairs bore their names; the\nmost desirable seats in the dining hall were theirs when, half famished\nbecause breakfast had been disregarded, they trooped in to luncheon; the\nbest waiters on the ship attended to their wants, and afterward their\ncabins were found to be cosily arranged with every comfort the heart of\nmaid could wish for.\n\nAt luncheon it was found that the steward had placed a letter before\nUncle John's plate. The handwriting of the address Louise, who sat next\nher uncle, at once recognized as that of her mother; but she said\nnothing.\n\nMr. Merrick was amazed at the contents of the communication, especially\nas he had so recently parted with the lady who had written it.\n\nIt said: \"I must warn you, John, that my daughter has just escaped a\nserious entanglement, and I am therefore more grateful than I can\nexpress that you are taking her far from home for a few weeks. A young\nman named Arthur Weldon--a son of the big railroad president, you\nknow--has been paying Louise marked attentions lately; but I cautioned\nher not to encourage him because a rumor had reached me that he has\nquarrelled with his father and been disinherited. My informant also\nasserted that the young man is wild and headstrong and cannot be\ncontrolled by his parent; but he always seemed gentlemanly enough at\nour house, and my greatest objection to him is that he is not likely to\ninherit a dollar of his father's money. Louise and I decided to keep him\ndangling until we could learn the truth of this matter, for you can\neasily understand that with her exceptional attractions there is no\nobject in Louise throwing herself away upon a poor man, or one who\ncannot give her a prominent position in society. Imagine my horror,\nJohn, when I discovered last evening that my only child, whom I have so\nfondly cherished, has ungratefully deceived me. Carried away by the\nimpetuous avowals of this young scapegrace, whom his own father disowns,\nshe has confessed her love for him--love for a pauper!--and only by the\nmost stringent exercise of my authority have I been able to exact from\nLouise a promise that she will not become formally engaged to Arthur\nWeldon, or even correspond with him, until she has returned home. By\nthat time I shall have learned more of his history and prospects, when I\ncan better decide whether to allow the affair to go on. Of course I have\nhopes that in case my fears are proven to have been well founded, I can\narouse Louise to a proper spirit and induce her to throw the fellow\nover. Meantime, I implore you, as my daughter's temporary guardian, not\nto allow Louise to speak of or dwell upon this young man, but try to\ninterest her in other gentlemen whom you may meet and lead her to\nforget, if possible, her miserable entanglement. Consider a loving\nmother's feelings, John. Try to help me in this emergency, and I shall\nbe forever deeply grateful.\"\n\n\"It's from mother, isn't it?\" asked Louise, when he had finished reading\nthe letter.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered gruffly, as he crumpled the missive and stuffed it\ninto his pocket.\n\n\"What does she say, Uncle?\"\n\n\"Nothing but rubbish and nonsense. Eat your soup, my dear; it's getting\ncold.\"\n\nThe girl's sweet, low laughter sounded very pleasant, and served to calm\nhis irritation. From her demure yet amused expression Uncle John guessed\nthat Louise knew the tenor of her mother's letter as well as if she had\nread it over his shoulder, and it comforted him that she could take the\nmatter so lightly. Perhaps the poor child was not so deeply in love as\nher mother had declared.\n\nHe was greatly annoyed at the confidence Mrs. Merrick had seen fit to\nrepose in him, and felt she had no right to burden him with any\nknowledge of such an absurd condition of affairs just as he was starting\nfor a holiday. Whatever might be the truth of the girl's\n\"entanglement,\"--and he judged that it was not all conveyed in Martha\nMerrick's subtle letter--Louise would surely be free and unhampered by\neither love or maternal diplomacy for some time to come. When she\nreturned home her mother might conduct the affair to suit herself. He\nwould have nothing to do with it in any way.\n\nAs soon as luncheon was finished they rushed for the deck, and you may\nimagine that chubby little Uncle John, with his rosy, smiling face and\nkindly eyes, surrounded by three eager and attractive girls of from\nfifteen to seventeen years of age, was a sight to compel the attention\nof every passenger aboard the ship.\n\nIt was found easy to make the acquaintance of the interesting group,\nand many took advantage of that fact; for Uncle John chatted brightly\nwith every man and Patsy required no excuse of a formal introduction to\nconfide to every woman that John Merrick was taking his three nieces to\nEurope to \"see the sights and have the time of their lives.\"\n\nMany of the business men knew well the millionaire's name, and accorded\nhim great respect because he was so enormously wealthy and successful.\nBut the little man was so genuinely human and unaffected and so openly\nscorned all toadyism that they soon forgot his greatness in the\nfinancial world and accepted him simply as a good fellow and an\ninvariably cheerful comrade.\n\nThe weather was somewhat rough for the latter part of March--they had\nsailed the twenty-seventh--but the \"Irene\" was so staunch and rode the\nwaves so gracefully that none of the party except Louise was at all\naffected by the motion. The eldest cousin, however, claimed to be\nindisposed for the first few days out, and so Beth and Patsy and Uncle\nJohn sat in a row in their steamer chairs, with the rugs tucked up to\ntheir waists, and kept themselves and everyone around them merry and\nlight hearted.\n\nNext to Patsy reclined a dark complexioned man of about thirty-five,\nwith a long, thin face and intensely black, grave eyes. He was\ncarelessly dressed and wore a flannel shirt, but there was an odd look\nof mingled refinement and barbarity about him that arrested the girl's\nattention. He sat very quietly in his chair, reserved both in speech and\nin manner; but when she forced him to talk he spoke impetuously and with\nalmost savage emphasis, in a broken dialect that amused her immensely.\n\n\"You can't be American,\" she said.\n\n\"I am Sicilian,\" was the proud answer.\n\n\"That's what I thought; Sicilian or Italian or Spanish; but I'm glad\nit's Sicilian, which is the same as Italian. I can't speak your lingo\nmyself,\" she continued, \"although I am studying it hard; but you manage\nthe English pretty well, so we shall get along famously together.\"\n\nHe did not answer for a moment, but searched her unconscious face with\nhis keen eyes. Then he demanded, brusquely:\n\n\"Where do you go?\"\n\n\"Why, to Europe,\" she replied, as if surprised.\n\n\"Europe? Pah! It is no answer at all,\" he responded, angrily. \"Europe is\nbig. To what part do you journey?\"\n\nPatsy hesitated. The magic word \"Europe\" had seemed to sum up their\ndestination very effectively, and she had heretofore accepted it as\nsufficient, for the time being, at least. Uncle John had bought an\narmful of guide books and Baedeckers, but in the hurry of departure she\nhad never glanced inside them. To go to Europe had been enough to\nsatisfy her so far, but perhaps she should have more definite knowledge\nconcerning their trip. So she turned to Uncle John and said:\n\n\"Uncle, dear, to what part of Europe are we going?\"\n\n\"What part?\" he answered. \"Why, it tells on the ticket, Patsy. I can't\nremember the name just now. It's where the ship stops, of course.\"\n\n\"That is Napoli,\" said the thin faced man, with a scarcely veiled sneer.\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"And then?\" repeated Patsy, turning to her Uncle.\n\n\"Then? Oh, some confounded place or other that I can't think of. I'm not\na time-table, Patsy; but the trip is all arranged, in beautiful style,\nby a friend of mine who has always wanted to go abroad, and so has the\nwhole programme mapped out in his head.\"\n\n\"Is it in his head yet?\" enquired Patsy, anxiously.\n\n\"No, dear; it's in the left hand pocket of my blue coat, all written\ndown clearly. So what's the use of bothering? We aren't there yet. By\nand bye we'll get to Eu-rope an' do it up brown. Whatever happens, and\nwherever we go, it's got to be a spree and a jolly good time; so take it\neasy, Patsy dear, and don't worry.\"\n\n\"That's all right, Uncle,\" she rejoined, with a laugh. \"I'm not worrying\nthe least mite. But when folks ask us where we're going, what shall we\nsay?\"\n\n\"Eu-rope.\"\n\n\"And then?\" mischievously.\n\n\"And then home again, of course. It's as plain as the nose on your face,\nPatsy Doyle, and a good bit straighter.\"\n\nThat made her laugh again, and the strange Italian, who was listening,\ngrowled a word in his native language. He wasn't at all a pleasant\ncompanion, but for that very reason Patsy determined to make him talk\nand \"be sociable.\" By degrees he seemed to appreciate her attention, and\nalways brightened when she came to sit beside him.\n\n\"You'll have to tell me your name, you know,\" she said to him; \"because\nI can't be calling you 'Sir' every minute.\"\n\nHe glanced nervously around. Then he answered, slowly:\n\n\"I am called Valdi--Victor Valdi.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's a pretty name, Mr. Valdi--or should I say Signor?\"\n\n\"You should.\"\n\n\"Do I pronounce it right?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, never mind if I don't; you'll know what I mean, and that I\nintend to be proper and polite,\" she responded, sweetly.\n\nBeth, while she made fewer acquaintances than Patsy, seemed to have cast\noff her sullen reserve when she boarded the ship. In truth, the girl was\nreally happy for the first time in her life, and it softened her so\nwonderfully and made her so attractive that she soon formed a select\ncircle around her. A young lady from Cleveland, who had two big\nbrothers, was impelled to introduce herself to Beth because of the young\nmen's intense admiration for the girl's beautiful face. When it was\nfound that they were all from Ohio, they formed a friendly alliance at\nonce. Marion Horton was so frank and agreeable that she managed to draw\nout all that was best in Beth's nature, and the stalwart young Hortons\nwere so shyly enthusiastic over this, their first trip abroad, that they\ninspired the girl with a like ardor, which resulted in the most cordial\nrelations between them.\n\nAnd it so happened that several other young men who chanced to be aboard\nthe \"Princess Irene\" marked the Hortons' intimacy with Beth and\ninsisted on being introduced by them, so that by the time Louise had\nconquered her _mal-de-mer_ and appeared on deck, she found an admiring\ngroup around her cousin that included most of the desirable young\nfellows on the ship. Beth sat enthroned like a queen, listening to her\ncourtiers and smiling encouragement now and then, but taking little part\nin the conversation herself because of her inexperience. Such adoration\nwas new to the little country girl, and she really enjoyed it. Nor did\nthe young men resent her silence. All that they wanted her to do, as Tom\nHorton tersely expressed it, was to \"sit still and look pretty.\"\n\nAs for Uncle John, he was so delighted with Beth's social success that\nhe adopted all the boys on the spot, and made them a part of what he\ncalled his family circle.\n\nLouise, discovering this state of affairs, gave an amused laugh and\njoined the group. She was a little provoked that she had isolated\nherself so long in her cabin when there was interesting sport on deck;\nbut having lost some valuable time she straightway applied herself to\nredeem the situation.\n\nIn the brilliance of her conversation, in her studied glances, in a\nthousand pretty ways that were skillfully rendered effective, she had a\ndecided advantage over her more beautiful cousin. When Louise really\ndesired to please she was indeed a charming companion, and young men are\nnot likely to detect insincerity in a girl who tries to captivate them.\n\nThe result was astonishing to Uncle John and somewhat humiliating to\nBeth; for a new queen was presently crowned, and Louise by some magnetic\npower assembled the court around herself. Only the youngest Horton boy,\nin whose susceptible heart Beth's image was firmly enshrined, refused to\nchange his allegiance; but in truth the girl enjoyed herself more\ngenuinely in the society of one loyal cavalier than when so many were\nclamoring for her favors. The two would walk the deck together for hours\nwithout exchanging a single word, or sit together silently listening to\nthe band or watching the waves, without the need, as Tom expressed it,\nof \"jabbering every blessed minute\" in order to be happy.\n\nPatsy was indignant at the artfulness of Louise until she noticed that\nBeth was quite content; then she laughed softly and watched matters take\ntheir course, feeling a little sorry for the boys because she knew\nLouise was only playing with them.\n\nThe trip across the Atlantic was all too short. On the fifth of April\nthey passed the Azores, running close to the islands of Fayal and San\nJorge so that the passengers might admire the zigzag rows of white\nhouses that reached from the shore far up the steep hillsides. On the\nsixth day they sighted Gibraltar and passed between the Moorish and\nSpanish lighthouses into the lovely waters of the Mediterranean. The\nworld-famed rock was now disclosed to their eyes, and when the ship\nanchored opposite it Uncle John assisted his nieces aboard the lighter\nand took them for a brief excursion ashore.\n\nOf course they rode to the fortress and wandered through its gloomy,\nimpressive galleries, seeing little of the armament because visitors are\nbarred from the real fortifications. The fortress did not seem\nespecially impregnable and was, taken altogether, a distinct\ndisappointment to them; but the ride through the town in the low basket\nphaetons was wholly delightful. The quaint, narrow streets and stone\narches, the beautiful vistas of sea and mountain, the swarthy, dark-eyed\nMoors whose presence lent to the town an oriental atmosphere, and the\nqueer market-places crowded with Spaniards, Frenchmen, Jews and\nred-coated English soldiers, altogether made up a panorama that was\nfascinating in the extreme.\n\nBut their stay was short, and after a rush of sightseeing that almost\nbewildered them they returned to the ship breathless but elated at\nhaving \"seen an' done,\" as Uncle John declared, their first foreign\nport.\n\nAnd now through waters so brightly blue and transparent that they\naroused the girls' wonder and admiration, the good ship plowed her way\ntoward the port of Naples, passing to the east of Sardinia and Corsica,\nwhich they viewed with eager interest because these places had always\nseemed so far away to them, and had now suddenly appeared as if by\nmagic directly before their eyes.\n\nPatsy and the big whiskered captain had become such good friends that he\nalways welcomed the girl on his own exclusive deck, and this afternoon\nshe sat beside him and watched the rugged panorama slip by.\n\n\"When will we get to Naples?\" she asked.\n\n\"To-morrow evening, probably,\" answered the captain. \"See, it is over in\nthat direction, where the gray cloud appears in the sky.\"\n\n\"And what is the gray cloud, Captain?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" said he, gravely. \"Perhaps smoke from Vesuvius. At\nGibraltar we heard that the volcano is in an ugly mood, I hope it will\ncause you no inconvenience.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't it be fine if we could see an eruption!\" exclaimed the girl.\n\nThe captain shook his head.\n\n\"Interesting, perhaps,\" he admitted; \"but no great calamity that causes\nthousands of people to suffer can be called 'fine.'\"\n\n\"Ah, that is true!\" she said, quickly. \"I had forgotten the suffering.\"\n\nNext morning all the sky was thick with smoke, and the sun was hidden.\nThe waters turned gray, too, and as they approached the Italian coast\nthe gloom perceptibly increased. A feeling of uneasiness seemed to\npervade the ship, and even the captain had so many things to consider\nthat he had no time to converse with his little friend.\n\nSignor Valdi forsook his deck chair for the first time and stood at the\nrail which overlooked the steerage with his eyes glued to the grim skies\nahead. When Uncle John asked him what he saw he answered, eagerly:\n\n\"Death and destruction, and a loss of millions of lira to the bankrupt\ngovernment. I know; for I have studied Etna for years, and Vesuvio is a\nsecond cousin to Etna.\"\n\n\"Hm,\" said Uncle John. \"You seem pleased with the idea of an eruption.\"\n\nThe thin faced man threw a shrewd look from his dark eyes and smiled.\nUncle John frowned at the look and stumped away. He was not at all easy\nin his own mind. He had brought three nieces for a holiday to this\nforeign shore, and here at the outset they were confronted by an\nintangible danger that was more fearful because it was not understood.\nIt was enough to make his round face serious, although he had so strong\nan objection to unnecessary worry.\n\nAfternoon tea was served on deck amidst an unusual quiet. People soberly\ncanvassed the situation and remarked upon the fact that the darkness\nincreased visibly as they neared the Bay of Naples. Beth couldn't drink\nher tea, for tiny black atoms fell through the air and floated upon the\nsurface of the liquid. Louise retired to her stateroom with a headache,\nand found her white serge gown peppered with particles of lava dust\nwhich had fallen from the skies.\n\nThe pilot guided the ship cautiously past Capri and into the bay. The\nair was now black with volcanic dross and a gloom as of midnight\nsurrounded them on every side. The shore, the mountain and the water of\nthe bay itself were alike invisible.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nVESUVIUS RAMPANT\n\n\nIt was Saturday night, the seventh day of April, nineteen hundred and\nsix--a night never to be forgotten by those aboard the ship; a night\nwhich has its place in history.\n\nAt dinner the captain announced that he had dropped anchor at the\nImmacollatella Nuova, but at a safe distance from the shore, and that no\npassengers would be landed under any circumstances until the fall of\nashes ceased and he could put his people ashore in a proper manner.\n\nA spirit of unrest fell upon them all. Big Tom Horton whispered to Beth\nthat he did not intend to leave her side until all danger was over. The\ndeck was deserted, all the passengers crowding into the smoking room and\nsaloons to escape the lava dust.\n\nFew kept their rooms or ventured to sleep. At intervals a loud\ndetonation from the volcano shook the air, and the mystery and awe of\nthe enveloping gloom were so palpable as almost to be felt.\n\nToward midnight the wind changed, driving the cloud of ashes to the\nsouthward and sufficiently clearing the atmosphere to allow the angry\nglow of the crater to be distinctly seen. Now it shot a pillar of fire\nthousands of feet straight into the heavens; then it would darken and\nroll skyward great clouds that were illumined by the showers of sparks\naccompanying them.\n\nThe windows of every cabin facing the volcano were filled with eager\nfaces, and in the smoking room Uncle John clasped Beth around the waist\nwith one arm and Patsy with the other and watched the wonderful\nexhibition through the window with a grave and anxious face. Tom Horton\nhad taken a position at one side of them and the dark Italian at the\nother. The latter assured Patsy they were in no danger whatever. Tom\nsecretly hoped they were, and laid brave plans for rescuing Beth or\nperishing at her side. Louise chose to lie in her berth and await\nevents with calm resignation. If they escaped she would not look haggard\nand hollow-eyed when morning came. If a catastrophy was pending she\nwould have no power to prevent it.\n\nIt was four o'clock on Sunday morning when Vesuvius finally reached the\nclimax of her travail. With a deep groan of anguish the mountain burst\nasunder, and from its side rolled a great stream of molten lava that\nslowly spread down the slope, consuming trees, vineyards and dwellings\nin its path and overwhelming the fated city of Bosco-Trecase.\n\nOur friends marked the course of destruction by watching the thread of\nfire slowly wander down the mountain slope. They did not know of the\ndesolation it was causing, but the sight was terrible enough to inspire\nawe in every breast.\n\nThe volcano was easier after that final outburst, but the black clouds\nformed thicker than ever, and soon obscured the sky again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nUNDER A CLOUD\n\n\n\"After all,\" said Uncle John, next morning, \"we may consider ourselves\nvery lucky. Your parents might have come to Naples a hundred times, my\ndears, and your children may come a hundred times more, and yet never\nsee the sights that have greeted us on our arrival. If the confounded\nold hill was bound to spout, it did the fair thing by spouting when we\nwere around. Eh, Patsy?\"\n\n\"I quite agree with you,\" said the girl. \"I wouldn't have missed it for\nanything--if it really had to behave so.\"\n\n\"But you'll pay for it!\" growled Signor Valdi, who had overheard these\nremarks. \"You will pay for it with a thousand discomforts--and I'm glad\nthat is so. Vesuvio is hell let loose; and it amuses you. Hundreds are\nlying dead and crushed; and you are lucky to be here. Listen,\" he\ndropped his voice to a whisper: \"if these Neapolitans could see the\nrejoicing in my heart, they would kill me. And you? Pah! you are no\nbetter. You also rejoice--and they will welcome you to Naples. I have\nadvice. Do not go on shore. It is useless.\"\n\nThey were all startled by this strange speech, and the reproof it\nconveyed made them a trifle uncomfortable; but Uncle John whispered that\nthe man was mad, and to pay no attention to him.\n\nAlthough ashes still fell softly upon the ship the day had somewhat\nlightened the gloom and they could see from deck the dim outlines of the\nshore. A crowd of boats presently swarmed around them, their occupants\neagerly clamoring for passengers to go ashore, or offering fruits,\nflowers and souvenirs to any who might be induced to purchase. Their\nindifference to their own and their city's danger was astonishing. It\nwas their custom to greet arriving steamers in this way, for by this\nmeans they gained a livelihood. Nothing short of absolute destruction\nseemed able to interfere with their established occupations.\n\nA steam tender also came alongside, and after a cordial farewell to the\nship's officers and their travelling acquaintances, Uncle John placed\nhis nieces and their baggage aboard the tender, which shortly deposited\nthem safely upon the dock.\n\nPerhaps a lot of passengers more dismal looking never before landed on\nthe beautiful shores of Naples--beautiful no longer, but presenting an\nappearance gray and grewsome. Ashes were ankle deep in the streets--a\nfine, flour-like dust that clung to your clothing, filled your eyes and\nlungs and seemed to penetrate everywhere. The foliage of the trees and\nshrubbery drooped under its load and had turned from green to the\nall-pervading gray. The grass was covered; the cornices and balconies of\nthe houses were banked with ashes.\n\n\"Bless me!\" said Uncle John. \"It's as bad as Pompey, or whatever that\ncity was called that was buried in the Bible days.\"\n\n\"Oh, not quite, Uncle,\" answered Patsy, in her cheery voice; \"but it may\nbe, before Vesuvius is satisfied.\"\n\n\"It is certainly bad enough,\" observed Louise, pouting as she marked the\ndestruction of her pretty cloak by the grimy deposit that was fast\nchanging its color and texture.\n\n\"Well, let us get under shelter as soon as possible,\" said Uncle John.\n\nThe outlines of a carriage were visible a short distance away. He walked\nup to the driver and said:\n\n\"We want to go to a hotel.\"\n\nThe man paid no attention.\n\n\"Ask him how much he charges, Uncle. You know you mustn't take a cab in\nNaples without bargaining.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"The driver will swindle you.\"\n\n\"I'll risk that,\" he answered. \"Just now we're lucky if we get a\ncarriage at all.\" He reached up and prodded the jehu in the ribs with\nhis cane. \"How much to the Hotel Vesuvius?\" he demanded, loudly.\n\nThe man woke up and flourished his whip, at the same time bursting into\na flood of Italian.\n\nThe girls listened carefully. They had been trying to study Italian\nfrom a small book Beth had bought entitled \"Italian in Three Weeks\nwithout a Master,\" but not a word the driver of the carriage said seemed\nto have occurred in the vocabulary of the book. He repeated \"Vesuvio\"\nmany times, however, with scornful, angry or imploring intonations, and\nLouise finally said:\n\n\"He thinks you want to go to the volcano, Uncle. The hotel is the\nVesuve, not the Vesuvius.\"\n\n\"What's the difference?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"All right; you girls just hop in, and leave the rest to me.\"\n\nHe tumbled them all into the vehicle, bag and baggage, and then said\nsternly to the driver:\n\n\"Ho-tel Ve-suve--Ve-suve--ho-tel Ve-suve! Drive there darned quick, or\nI'll break your confounded neck.\"\n\nThe carriage started. It plowed its way jerkily through the dust-laden\nstreets and finally stopped at an imposing looking structure. The day\nwas growing darker, and an electric lamp burned before the entrance.\nBut no one came out to receive them.\n\nUncle John climbed out and read the sign. \"Hotel du Vesuve.\" It was the\nestablishment he had been advised to stop at while in Naples. He\ncompared the sign with a card which he drew from his pocket, and knew\nthat he had made no mistake.\n\nEntering the spacious lobby, he found it deserted. In the office a man\nwas hastily making a package of some books and papers and did not\nrespond or even look up when spoken to. At the concierge's desk a big,\nwhiskered man sat staring straight ahead of him with a look of abject\nterror in his eyes.\n\n\"Good morning,\" said Uncle John. \"Fine day, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Did you hear it?\" whispered the concierge, as a dull boom, like that of\na distant cannon, made the windows rattle in their casements.\n\n\"Of course,\" replied Mr. Merrick, carelessly. \"Old Vesuve seems on a\nrampage. But never mind that now. We've just come from America, where\nthe mountains are more polite, and we're going to stop at your hotel.\"\n\nThe concierge's eyes wandered from the man to the three girls who had\nentered and grouped themselves behind him. Then they fell upon the\ndriver of the carriage, who burst into a torrent of vociferous but\nwholly unintelligible exclamations which Uncle John declared \"must be an\nexcuse--and a mighty poor one--for talking.\"\n\nThe whiskered man, whose cap was elaborately embroidered in gold with\nthe words \"Hotel du Vesuve,\" seemed to understand the driver. He sighed\ndrearily and said to Mr. Merrick:\n\n\"You must pay him thirty lira.\"\n\n\"How much is that?\"\n\n\"Six dollars.\"\n\n\"Not by a jugfull!\"\n\n\"You made no bargain.\"\n\n\"I couldn't. He can't talk.\"\n\n\"He claims it is you who cannot talk.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"And prices are advanced during these awful days. What does it matter?\nYour money will do you no good when we are all buried deep in ash and\nscoria.\"\n\nThe big man shuddered at this gloomy picture, and added, listlessly:\n\"You'll have to pay.\"\n\nUncle John paid, but the driver wouldn't accept American money. The\ndisconsolate concierge would, though. He unlocked a drawer, put the six\ndollars into one section and drew from another two ten-lira notes. The\ndriver took them, bowed respectfully to the whiskered man, shot a\nbroadside of invective Italian at the unconscious Americans, and left\nthe hotel.\n\n\"How about rooms?\" asked Uncle John.\n\n\"Take any you please,\" answered the concierge. \"All our guests are gone\nbut two--two mad Americans like yourselves. The servants are also gone;\nthe chef has gone; the elevator conductors are gone. If you stay you'll\nhave to walk up.\"\n\n\"Where have they all gone?\" asked Uncle John, wonderingly.\n\n\"Fled, sir; fled to escape destruction. They remember Pompeii. Only\nSignor Floriano, the proprietor, and myself are left. We stick to the\nlast. We are brave.\"\n\n\"So I see. Now, look here, my manly hero. It's possible we shall all\nlive through it; I'll bet you a thousand to ten that we do. And then\nyou'll be glad to realize you've pocketed a little more American money.\nCome out of that box and show us some rooms, and I'll help to build up\nyour fortune.\"\n\nThe concierge obeyed. Even the horrors of the situation could not\neliminate from his carefully trained nature that desire to accumulate\nwhich is the prime qualification of his profession. The Americans walked\nup one flight and found spacious rooms on the first floor, of which they\nimmediately took possession.\n\n\"Send for our trunks,\" said Mr. Merrick; and the man consented to do so\nprovided he could secure a proper vehicle.\n\n\"You will be obliged to pay high for it,\" he warned; \"but that will not\nmatter. To witness the destruction of our beautiful Naples is an unusual\nsight. It will be worth your money.\"\n\n\"We'll settle that in the dim hereafter,\" replied Uncle John. \"You get\nthe trunks, and I'll take care of the finances.\"\n\nWhen the concierge had retired the girls began to stuff newspapers into\nthe cracks of the windows of their sitting room, where the fine ash was\nsifting in and forming little drifts several inches in thickness. Also\nthe atmosphere of the room was filled with impalpable particles of dust,\nwhich rendered breathing oppressive and unpleasant.\n\nUncle John watched them for a time, and his brow clouded.\n\n\"See here, girls,\" he exclaimed; \"let's hold a council of war. Do you\nsuppose we are in any real danger?\"\n\nThey grouped around him with eager interest.\n\n\"It's something new to be in danger, and rather exciting, don't you\nthink?\" said Beth. \"But perhaps we're as safe as we would be at home.\"\n\n\"Once,\" said Louise, slowly, \"there was a great eruption of Vesuvius\nwhich destroyed the cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii. Many of the\ninhabitants were buried alive. Perhaps they thought there was no real\ndanger.\"\n\nUncle John scratched his head reflectively.\n\n\"I take it,\" he observed, \"that the moral of your story is to light out\nwhile we have the chance.\"\n\n\"Not necessarily,\" observed the girl, smiling at his perplexity. \"It is\nlikewise true that many other eruptions have occurred, when little\ndamage was done.\"\n\n\"Forewarned is forearmed,\" declared Patsy. \"Naples isn't buried more\nthan six inches in ashes, as yet, and it will take days for them to\nreach to our windows, provided they're falling at the same rate they do\nnow. I don't see any use of getting scared before to-morrow, anyhow.\"\n\n\"It's a big hill,\" said Uncle John, gravely, \"and I've no right to take\nfoolish chances with three girls on my hands.\"\n\n\"I'm not frightened, Uncle John.\"\n\n\"Nor I.\"\n\n\"Nor I, the least bit.\"\n\n\"Everyone has left the hotel but ourselves,\" said he.\n\n\"How sorry they will be, afterward,\" remarked Beth.\n\nHe looked at them admiringly, and kissed each one.\n\n\"You stay in this room and don't move a peg till I get back,\" he\nenjoined them; \"I'm going out to look over the situation.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nA FRIEND IN NEED\n\n\nSome of Mr. Merrick's business friends in New York, hearing of his\nproposed trip, had given him letters of introduction to people in\nvarious European cities. He had accepted them--quite a bunch,\naltogether--but had firmly resolved not to use them. Neither he nor the\nnieces cared to make superficial acquaintances during their wanderings.\nYet Uncle John chanced to remember that one of these letters was to a\ncertain Colonel Angeli of the Twelfth Italian Regiment, occupying the\nbarracks on the Pizzofalcone hill at Naples. This introduction, tendered\nby a relative of the Colonel's American wife, was now reposing in Mr.\nMerrick's pocket, and he promptly decided to make use of it in order to\nobtain expert advice as to the wisdom of remaining in the stricken city.\n\nEnquiring his way from the still dazed concierge, he found that the\nPizzofalcone barracks were just behind the hotel but several hundred\nfeet above it; so he turned up the Strada St. Lucia and soon came upon\nthe narrow lane that wound upward to the fortifications. It was a long\nand tedious climb in the semi-darkness caused by the steady fall of\nashes, and at intervals the detonations from Vesuvius shook the huge\nrock and made its massive bulk seem insecure. But the little man\npersevered, and finally with sweating brow arrived at the barracks.\n\nA soldier carried in the letter to his colonel and presently returned to\nusher Uncle John through the vast building, up a flight of steps, and so\nto a large covered balcony suspended many hundred feet above the Via\nPartenope, where the hotel was situated.\n\nHere was seated a group of officers, watching intently the cloud that\nmarked the location of the volcano. Colonel Angeli, big and bluff, his\nuniform gorgeous, his dark, heavy moustaches carefully waxed, his\nhandsome face as ingenuous and merry as a schoolboy's, greeted the\nAmerican with a gracious courtesy that made Uncle John feel quite at\nhis ease. When he heard of the nieces the Italian made a grimace and\nthen laughed.\n\n\"I am despairing, signore,\" said he, in English sufficiently\nstrangulated to be amusing but nevertheless quite comprehensible, \"that\nyou and the sweet signorini are to see our lovely Naples under\ntribulations so very great. But yesterday, in all the world is no city\nso enchanting, so brilliant, so gay. To-day--look! is it not horrible?\nVesuvio is sick, and Naples mourns until the tyrant is well again.\"\n\n\"But the danger,\" said Uncle John. \"What do you think of the wisdom of\nour staying here? Is it safe to keep my girls in Naples during this\neruption?\"\n\n\"Ah! Why not? This very morning the mountain asunder burst, and we who\nlove our people dread the news of devastation we shall hear. From the\nobservatory, where His Majesty's faithful servant still remains, come\ntelegrams that the great pebbles--what we call scoria--have ruined\nOttajano and San Guiseppe. Perhaps they are overwhelmed. But the beast\nhas vomited; he will feel better now, and ever become more quiet.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" remarked Mr. Merrick, thoughtfully, \"that no one knows\nexactly what the blamed hill may do next. I don't like to take chances\nwith three girls on my hands. They are a valuable lot, Colonel, and\nworth saving.\"\n\nThe boyish Italian instantly looked grave. Then he led Uncle John away\nfrom the others, although doubtless he was the only officer present able\nto speak or understand English, and said to him:\n\n\"Where are you living?\"\n\n\"At the hotel named after your sick mountain--the Vesuve.\"\n\n\"Very good. In the bay, not distant from your hotel, lies a government\nlaunch that is under my command. At my home in the Viala Elena are a\nwife and two children, who, should danger that is serious arise, will be\nput by my soldiers on the launch, to carry them to safety. Admirable, is\nit not?\"\n\n\"Very good arrangement,\" said Uncle John.\n\n\"It renders me content to know that in any difficulty they cannot be\nhurt. I am not scare, myself, but it is pleasant to know I have what you\ncall the side that is safe. From my American wife I have many of your\nexcellent speech figures. But now! The launch is big. Remain happy in\nNaples--happy as Vesuvio will let you--and watch his vast, his gigantic\nexhibition. If danger come, you all enter my launch and be saved. If no\ndanger, you have a marvelous experience.\" The serious look glided from\nhis face, and was replaced by a smile as bright as before.\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" responded Uncle John, gratefully. \"I shall go\nback to the girls well satisfied.\"\n\n\"Make the signorini stay in to-day,\" warned the colonel. \"It is bad,\njust now, and so black one can nothing at all observe. To-morrow it will\nbe better, and all can go without. I will see you myself, then, and tell\nyou what to do.\"\n\nThen he insisted that Uncle John clear his parched throat with a glass\nof vermouth--a harmless drink of which all Italians are very fond--and\nsent him away much refreshed in body and mind.\n\nHe made his way through the ashy rain back to the hotel. People were\nholding umbrellas over their heads and plodding through the dust with\nseeming unconcern. At one corner a street singer was warbling, stopping\nfrequently to cough the lava dust from his throat or shake it from his\nbeloved mandolin. A procession of peasants passed, chanting slowly and\nsolemnly a religious hymn. At the head of the column was borne aloft a\ngilded statuette of the Virgin, and although Uncle John did not know it,\nthese simple folks were trusting in the sacred image to avert further\ndisaster from the angry mountain.\n\nOn arriving home Mr. Merrick told the girls with great elation of his\nnew friend, and how they were to be taken aboard the launch in case of\nemergency.\n\n\"But how will we know when danger threatens?\" asked Louise.\n\nWhile Uncle John tried to think of an answer to this puzzling query\nsomeone knocked upon the door. The concierge was standing in the\npassage and beside him was a soldier in uniform, a natty cock's plume\nupon his beaver hat and a short carbine over his arm.\n\n\"A guard from Colonel Angeli, Signor,\" said the concierge,\nrespectfully--the first respectful tone he had yet employed.\n\nThe soldier took off his hat with a flourish, and bowed low.\n\n\"He is to remain in the hotel, sir, yet will not disturb you in any\nway,\" continued the whiskered one. \"But should he approach you at any\ntime and beckon you to follow him, do so at once, and without\nhesitation. It is Colonel Angeli's wish. You are in the charge of this\nbrave man, who will watch over your welfare.\"\n\n\"That settles it, my dears,\" said Uncle John, cheerfully, when the\nsoldier and the concierge had withdrawn. \"This Italian friend doesn't do\nthings by halves, and I take it we are perfectly safe from this time\non.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nACROSS THE BAY\n\n\nTom Horton called an hour later. He was in despair because his party had\ndecided to leave Naples for Rome, and he feared Beth would be engulfed\nby the volcano unless he was present to protect her.\n\n\"Mr. Merrick,\" said the boy, earnestly, \"you'll take good care of Miss\nDe Graf, sir, won't you? We both live in Ohio, you know, and we've just\ngot acquainted; and--and I'd like to see her again, some time, if she\nescapes.\"\n\nUncle John's eyes twinkled, but he drew a long face.\n\n\"My dear Tom,\" he said, \"don't ask me to take care of anyone--please\ndon't! I brought these girls along to take care of _me_--three of 'em,\nsir--and they've got to do their duty. Don't you worry about the girls;\njust you worry about _me_.\"\n\nThat was not much consolation for the poor fellow, but he could do\nnothing more than wring their hands--Beth's twice, by mistake--and wish\nthem good luck before he hurried away to rejoin his family.\n\n\"I'm sorry to see him go,\" said Beth, honestly. \"Tom is a nice boy.\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" agreed Uncle John. \"I hope we shall meet no worse fellows\nthan Tom Horton.\"\n\nAt noon they were served a modest luncheon in their rooms, for Signor\nFloriano, having sent his important papers to a place of safety, had\nresolved to stick to his hotel and do his duty by any guests that chose\nto remain with him in defiance of the existent conditions. He had\nsucceeded in retaining a few servants who had more courage than those\nthat had stampeded at the first alarm, and while the hotel service for\nthe next few days was very inadequate, no one was liable to suffer any\ngreat privation.\n\nDuring the afternoon the gloom grew denser than before, while thicker\nthan ever fell the rain of ashes. This was the worst day Naples\nexperienced during the great eruption, and Uncle John and his nieces\nwere content to keep their rooms and live in the glare of electric\nlights. Owing to their wise precautions to keep out the heavily laden\nair they breathed as little lava dust into their lungs as any people,\nperhaps, in the city; but to escape all was impossible. Their eyes and\nthroats became more or less inflamed by the floating atoms, and the\ngirls declared they felt as if they were sealed up in a tomb.\n\n\"Well, my chickens, how do you like being abroad, and actually in\nEurope?\" enquired Uncle John, cheerfully.\n\nBeth and Patsy smiled at him, but Louise looked up from the Baedecker\nshe was studying and replied:\n\n\"It's simply delightful, Uncle, and I'm glad we happened here during\nthis splendid eruption of Vesuvius. Only--only--\"\n\n\"Only what, my dear?\"\n\n\"Only it is such hard work to keep clean,\" answered his dainty niece.\n\"Even the water is full of lava, and I'm sure my face looks like a\nchimney-sweep's.\"\n\n\"And you, Beth?\"\n\n\"I don't like it, Uncle. I'm sure I'd prefer Naples in sunshine,\nalthough this is an experience we can brag about when we get home.\"\n\n\"That is the idea, exactly,\" said Louise, \"and the only thing that\nreconciles me to the discomforts. Thousands see Naples in sunshine, but\nfew can boast seeing Vesuvius in eruption. It will give us considerable\nprestige when we return home.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is why I selected this time to bring you here,\" declared Uncle\nJohn, with a comical wink. \"I ordered the eruption before I left home,\nand I must say they've been very prompt about it, and done the thing up\nbrown. Eh, Patsy?\"\n\n\"Right you are, Uncle. But you might tell 'em to turn off the eruption\nnow, because we've had enough.\"\n\n\"Don't like Eu-rope, eh?\"\n\n\"Why, if I thought all Europe was surrounded by volcanoes, I'd go home\nat once, if I had to walk. But the geographies don't mention many of\nthese spouters, so we may as well stick out our present experience and\nhope the rest of the continent will behave better. The Major'll be\nworried to death when he hears of this.\"\n\n\"I've sent him a cable,\" said Uncle John.\n\n\"What did you say?\" asked Patsy, eagerly.\n\n\"'All safe and well and enjoying the fireworks.'\"\n\n\"I'm glad you did that,\" replied the girl, deeply grateful at this\nevidence of thoughtfulness. \"It's bad enough for the Major to have me\naway, without making him worry, into the bargain.\"\n\n\"Well, no one is likely to worry about me,\" said Beth, philosophically.\n\n\"Mother seldom reads the papers, except to get the society news,\"\nremarked Louise. \"I doubt if she'll hear of the eruption, unless the\nMajor happens to tell her.\"\n\n\"I've cabled them all,\" said Uncle John. \"They're entitled to know that\ntheir kidiwinkles are in good shape.\"\n\nThe evening was a tedious one, although they tried to enliven it with a\ngame of bridge, in which Uncle John and Louise were quite proficient\nand the others dreadfully incompetent. Once in a while the volcano\nthundered a deep detonation that caused the windows to shiver, but the\nAmericans were getting used to the sound and paid little heed to it.\n\nIn the morning the wind had shifted, and although the air was still full\nof dust all near-by objects were clearly visible and even the outline of\nVesuvius could be seen sending skyward its pillar of black smoke.\n\nColonel Angeli appeared soon after breakfast, his uniform fresh and\nbright and his boyish face beaming as pleasantly as ever.\n\n\"Vesuvio is better,\" said he, \"but the rascal has badly acted and done\nmuch harm to our poor people. Like Herculaneum, our Boscatrecase is\ncovered with lava; like Pompeii our Ottajano is buried in ashes. Let me\nadvise you. To-day go to Sorrento, and there stay for a time, until we\ncan the dust brush from our streets and prepare to welcome you with the\ncomfort more serene. I must myself ride to the villages that are\nsuffering. My men are already gone, with the Red-Cross corps, to succor\nwhom they can. I will send to you word when you may return. Just now,\nshould you stay, you will be able to see nothing at all.\"\n\n\"I believe that is wise counsel,\" replied Uncle John.\n\n\"Sorrento has no ashes,\" continued the Colonel, \"and from there you may\nwatch the volcano better than from Naples. To-day come the Duke and\nDuchess d'Aosta to render assistance to the homeless and hungry;\nto-morrow His Majesty the King will be here to discover what damage has\nbeen caused. Alas! we have no sackcloth, but we are in ashes. I trust\nyou will pardon my poor Naples for her present inhospitality.\"\n\n\"Sure thing,\" said Uncle John. \"The city may be under a cloud, but her\npeople are the right stuff, and we are greatly obliged to you for all\nyour kindness to us.\"\n\n\"But that is so little!\" said the colonel, deprecatingly.\n\nThey decided to leave their heavy baggage at the Hotel du Vesuve, and\ncarried only their suit-cases and light luggage aboard the little\nsteamer that was bound across the bay for Sorrento. The decks were\nthronged with people as eager to get away from the stricken city as were\nour friends, and Uncle John was only enabled to secure seats for his\ngirls by bribing a steward so heavily that even that modern brigand was\namazed at his good fortune.\n\nThe ride was short but very interesting, for they passed under the\nshadow of the smoking mountain and came into a fresh, sweet atmosphere\nthat was guiltless of a speck of the disagreeable lava dust that had so\nlong annoyed them. The high bluffs of Sorrento, with their picturesque\nvillas and big hotels, seemed traced in burnished silver by the strong\nsunshine, and every member of Uncle John's party was glad that Colonel\nAngeli had suggested this pleasant change of condition.\n\nSmall boats took them ashore and an elevator carried them swiftly to the\ntop of the cliff and deposited them on the terrace of the Victoria, a\nbeautiful inn that nestled in a garden brilliant with splendid flowers\nand shrubbery. Here they speedily established themselves, preparing to\nenjoy their first real experience of \"Sunny Italy.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nCOUNT FERRALTI\n\n\nAt dinner it was announced that the famous Tarantella would be danced in\nthe lower hall of the hotel at nine o'clock, and the girls told Uncle\nJohn that they must not miss this famous sight, which is one of the most\nunique in Sorrento, or indeed in all Italy.\n\nAs they entered the pretty, circular hall devoted to the dance Louise\ngave a start of surprise. A goodly audience had already assembled in the\nroom, and among them the girl seemed to recognize an acquaintance, for\nafter a brief hesitation she advanced and placed her hand in that of a\ngentleman who had risen on her entrance and hastened toward her.\n\nHe was a nice looking young fellow, Beth thought, and had a foreign and\nquite distinguished air.\n\nPresently Louise turned with cheeks somewhat flushed and brought the\ngentleman to her party, introducing him to Uncle John and her cousins as\nCount Ferralti, whom she had once met in New York while he was on a\nvisit to America.\n\nThe Count twirled his small and slender moustaches in a way that Patsy\nthought affected, and said in excellent English:\n\n\"It delights me to meet Mr. Merrick and the young ladies. May I express\na hope that you are pleased with my beautiful country?\"\n\n\"Are you Italian?\" asked Uncle John, regarding the young man critically.\n\n\"Surely, Mr. Merrick. But I have resided much in New York, and may well\nclaim to be an adopted son of your great city.\"\n\n\"New York adopts a good many,\" said Uncle John, drily. \"It has even been\nthoughtless enough to adopt me.\"\n\nThe dancers entered at that moment and the Americans were forced to seat\nthemselves hastily so as not to obstruct the view of others. Count\nFerralti found a place beside Louise, but seemed to have little to say\nto her during the course of the entertainment.\n\nThe dances were unique and graceful, being executed by a troup of\nlaughing peasants dressed in native costume, who seemed very proud of\ntheir accomplishment and anxious to please the throng of tourists\npresent. The Tarantella originated in Ischia, but Sorrento and Capri\nhave the best dancers.\n\nAfterward Uncle John and his nieces stood upon the terrace and watched\nthe volcano rolling its dense clouds, mingled with sparks of red-hot\nscoria, toward the sky. The Count clung to Louise's side, but also tried\nto make himself agreeable to her cousins. In their rooms that night\nPatsy told Beth that the young foreigner was \"too highfalutin' to suit\nher,\" and Beth replied that his manners were so like those of their\nCousin Louise that the two ought to get along nicely together.\n\nUncle John liked his nieces to make friends, and encouraged young men\ngenerally to meet them; but there was something in the appearance of\nthis callow Italian nobleman that stamped his character as artificial\nand insincere. He resolved to find out something about his antecedents\nbefore he permitted the young fellow to establish friendly relations\nwith his girls.\n\nNext morning after breakfast he wandered through the lobby and paused at\nthe little office, where he discovered that the proprietor of this hotel\nwas a brother of that Floriano who managed the Hotel du Vesuve. That\ngave him an excuse to talk with the man, who spoke very good English and\nwas exceedingly courteous to his guests--especially when they were\nAmerican.\n\n\"I see you have Count Ferralti with you,\" remarked Uncle John.\n\n\"Whom, sir?\"\n\n\"Ferralti--Count Ferralti. The young man standing by the window,\nyonder.\"\n\n\"I--I did not know,\" he said, hesitatingly. \"The gentleman arrived last\nevening, and I had not yet learned his name. Let me see,\" he turned to\nhis list of guests, who register by card and not in a book, and\ncontinued: \"Ah, yes; he has given his name as Ferralti, but added no\ntitle. A count, did you say?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Uncle John.\n\nThe proprietor looked curiously toward the young man, whose back only\nwas visible. Then he remarked that the eruption of Vesuvius was waning\nand the trouble nearly over for this time.\n\n\"Are the Ferraltis a good family?\" asked Uncle John, abruptly.\n\n\"That I cannot tell you, Signor Merrick.\"\n\n\"Oh. Perhaps you know little about the nobility of your country.\"\n\n\"I! I know little of the nobility!\" answered Floriano, indignantly. \"My\ndear signor, there is no man better posted as to our nobility in all\nItaly.\"\n\n\"Yet you say you don't know the Ferralti family.\"\n\nThe proprietor reached for a book that lay above his desk.\n\n\"Observe, signor. Here is our record of nobility. It is the same as the\n'Blue Book' or the 'Peerage' of England. Either fortunately or\nunfortunately--I cannot say--you have no need of such a book in\nAmerica.\"\n\nHe turned the pages and ran his finger down the line of \"Fs.\"\n\n\"Find me, if you can, a Count Ferralti in the list.\"\n\nUncle John looked. He put on his glasses and looked again. The name of\nFerralti was no place in the record.\n\n\"Then there is no such count, Signor Floriano.\"\n\n\"And no such noble family, Signor Merrick.\"\n\nUncle John whistled softly and walked away to the window. The young man\ngreeted him with a smile and a bow.\n\n\"I misunderstood your name last evening,\" he said. \"I thought you were\nCount Ferralti.\"\n\n\"And that is right, sir,\" was the prompt reply. \"Allow me to offer you\nmy card.\"\n\nUncle John took the card and read:\n\n     \"CONTE LEONARDI FERRALTI,\n                     Milano, Italia.\"\n\nHe carefully placed the card in his pocket-book.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said he. \"It's a fine morning, Count.\"\n\n\"Charming, Mr. Merrick.\"\n\nUncle John walked away. He was glad that he had not suspected the young\nman unjustly. When an imposture is unmasked it is no longer dangerous.\n\nHe joined his nieces, who were all busily engaged in writing letters\nhome, and remarked, casually:\n\n\"You've been deceived in your Italian friend, Louise. He is neither a\ncount nor of noble family, although I suppose when you met him in New\nYork he had an object in posing as a titled aristocrat.\"\n\nThe girl paused, examining the point of her pen thoughtfully.\n\n\"Are you sure, Uncle John?\"\n\n\"Quite sure, my dear. I've just been through the list of Italian counts,\nand his name is not there. Floriano, the proprietor, who knows every\naristocrat in Italy, has never before heard of him.\"\n\n\"How singular!\" exclaimed Louise. \"I wonder why he has tried to deceive\nus.\"\n\n\"Oh, the world is full of impostors; but when you are on to their game\nthey are quite harmless. Of course we won't encourage this young man in\nany way. It will be better to avoid him.\"\n\n\"He--he seems very nice and gentlemanly,\" said Louise with hesitation.\n\nThe other girls exchanged glances, but made no remark. Uncle John hardly\nknew what to say further. He felt he was in an awkward position, for\nLouise was the most experienced in worldly ways of his three nieces and\nhe had no desire to pose as a stern guardian or to deprive his girls of\nany passing pleasure they might enjoy. Moreover, Louise being in love\nwith that young Weldon her mother so strongly objected to, she would not\nbe likely to care much for this Italian fellow, and Mrs. Merrick had\nenjoined him to keep her daughter's mind from dwelling on her\n\"entanglement.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, my dear,\" he said to her, \"you must act as you see fit. I do\nnot imagine we shall see much of this young man, in any event, and now\nthat you are well aware of the fact that he is sailing under false\ncolors, you will know how to handle him better than I can advise you.\"\n\n\"I shall be very careful,\" said Louise slowly, as she resumed her\nwriting.\n\n\"Well then, girls, what do you say to a stroll around the village?\"\nasked their uncle. \"I'm told it's a proper place to buy silk stockings\nand inlaid wood-work. They come assorted, I suppose.\"\n\nBeth and Patsy jumped up with alacrity, but Louise pleaded that she had\nseveral more letters to write; so the others left her and passed the\nrest of the forenoon in rummaging among the quaint shops of Sorrento,\nstaring at the statue of Tasso, and enjoying the street scenes so\nvividly opposed to those of America. It was almost their first glimpse\nof foreign manners and customs. In Naples they had as yet seen nothing\nbut darkness and falling ashes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE ROAD TO AMALFI\n\n\nThe Hotel Victoria faces the bay of Naples. Back of it are the famous\ngardens, and as you emerge from these you find yourself upon the narrow\nmain street of Sorrento, not far from the Square of Tasso.\n\nAs our little party entered this street they were immediately espied by\nthe vetturini, or cabmen, who rushed toward them with loud cries while\nthey waved their whips frantically to attract attention. One tall fellow\nwas dressed in a most imposing uniform of blue and gold, with a high hat\nbearing a cockade _a la Inglese_ and shiny top boots. His long legs\nenabled him to outstrip the others, and in an almost breathless voice he\nbegged Uncle John to choose his carriage: \"the besta carrozza ina town!\"\n\n\"We don't want to ride,\" was the answer.\n\nThe cabman implored. Certainly they must make the Amalfi drive, or to\nMassa Lubrense or Saint' Agata or at least Il Deserto! The others stood\nby to listen silently to the discussion, yielding first place to the\nvictor in the race.\n\nUncle John was obdurate.\n\n\"All we want to-day is to see the town,\" he declared, \"We're not going\nto ride, but walk.\"\n\n\"Ah, but the Amalfi road, signore! Surely you will see that.\"\n\n\"To-morrow, perhaps; not now.\"\n\n\"To-morrow, signore! It is good. At what hour, to-morrow,\nillustrissimo?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't bother me.\"\n\n\"We may as well drive to Amalfi to-morrow,\" suggested Beth. \"It is the\nproper thing to do, Uncle.\"\n\n\"All right; we'll go, then.\"\n\n\"You take my carrozza, signore?\" begged the cabman. \"It is besta ina\ntown.\"\n\n\"Let us see it.\"\n\nInstantly the crowd scampered back to the square, followed more\nleisurely by Uncle John and the girls. There the uniformed vetturio\nstood beside the one modern carriage in the group. It was new; it was\nglossy; it had beautiful, carefully brushed cushions; it was drawn by a\npair of splendid looking horses.\n\n\"Is not bellissima, signore?\" asked the man, proudly.\n\n\"All right,\" announced Uncle John, nodding approval. \"Be ready to start\nat nine o'clock to-morrow morning.\"\n\nThe man promised, whereat his confreres lost all interest in the matter\nand the strangers were allowed to proceed without further interruption.\n\nThey found out all about the Amalfi drive that evening, and were glad\nindeed they had decided to go. Even Louise was pleased at the\narrangement and as eager as the others to make the trip. It is one of\nthe most famous drives in the world, along a road built upon the rocky\ncliff that overhangs the sea and continually winds in and out as it\nfollows the outlines of the crags.\n\nThey had an early breakfast and were ready at nine o'clock; but when\nthey came to the gate of the garden they found only a dilapidated\ncarriage standing before it.\n\n\"Do you know where my rig is?\" Uncle John asked the driver, at the same\ntime peering up and down the road.\n\n\"It is me, sir signore. I am engage by you. Is it not so?\"\n\nMr. Merrick looked at the driver carefully. It was long-legs, sure\nenough, but shorn of his beautiful regalia.\n\n\"Where's your uniform?\" he asked.\n\n\"Ah, I have leave it home. The road is dusty, very; I must not ruin a\nnice dress when I work,\" answered the man, smiling unabashed.\n\n\"But the carriage. What has become of the fine carriage and the good\nhorses, sir?\"\n\n\"Ah, it is dreadful; it is horrible, signore. I find me the carrozza is\nnot easy; it is not perfect; it do not remain good for a long ride. So I\nleave him home, for I am kind. I do not wish the signorini bella to tire\nand weep. But see the fine vetture you now have! Is he not easy like\nfeathers, an' strong, an' molto buena?\"\n\n\"It may be a bird, but it don't look it,\" said Uncle John, doubtfully.\n\"I rented the best looking rig in town, and you bring me the worst.\"\n\n\"Only try, signore! Others may look; it is only you who must ride. You\nwill be much please when we return.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose we may as well take it,\" said the little man, in a\nresigned tone. \"Hop in, my dears.\"\n\nThey entered the crazy looking vehicle and found the seats ample and\ncomfortable despite the appearance of dilapidation everywhere prevalent.\nThe driver mounted the box, cracked his whip, and the lean nags ambled\naway at a fair pace.\n\nThey passed near to the square, where the first thing that attracted\nUncle John's attention was the beautiful turnout he had hired yesterday.\nIt was standing just as it had before, and beside it was another man\ndressed in the splendid uniform his driver had claimed that he had left\nat home.\n\n\"Here--stop! Stop, I say!\" he yelled at the man, angrily. But the fellow\nseemed suddenly deaf, and paid no heed. He cracked his whip and rattled\naway through the streets without a glance behind him. The girls laughed\nand Uncle John stopped waving his arms and settled into his seat with a\ngroan.\n\n\"We've been swindled, my dears,\" he said; \"swindled most beautifully.\nBut I suppose we may as well make the best of it.\"\n\n\"Better,\" agreed Patsy. \"This rig is all right, Uncle. It may not be as\npretty as the other, but I expect that one is only kept to make\nengagements with. When it comes to actual use, we don't get it.\"\n\n\"That's true enough,\" he returned. \"But I'll get even with this rascal\nbefore I've done with him, never fear.\"\n\nIt was a cold, raw morning, but the portiere at the Victoria had told\nthem the sun would be out presently and the day become more genial.\nIndeed, the sun did come out, but only to give a discouraged look at the\nlandscape and retire again. During this one day in which they rode to\nAmalfi and back, Uncle John afterward declared that they experienced\nseven different kinds of weather. They had sunshine, rain, hail, snow\nand a tornado; and then rain again and more sunshine. \"Sunny Italy\"\nseemed a misnomer that day, as indeed it does many days in winter and\nspring, when the climate is little better than that prevailing in the\neastern and central portions of the United States. And perhaps one\nsuffers more in Italy than in America, owing to the general lack of\nmeans to keep warm on cold days. The Italian, shivering and blue, will\ntell you it is not cold at all, for he will permit no reproach to lie on\nhis beloved land; but the traveller frequently becomes discouraged, and\nthe American contingent, especially, blames those misleading English\nwriters who, finding relief from their own bleak island in Italian\nclimes, exaggerated the conditions by apostrophizing the country as\n\"Sunny Italy\" and for more than a century uttered such rhapsodies in its\npraise that the whole world credited them--until it acquired personal\nexperience of the matter.\n\nItaly is beautiful; it is charming and delightful; but seldom is this\ntrue in winter or early spring.\n\nThe horses went along at a spanking pace that was astonishing. They\npassed through the picturesque lanes of Sorrento, climbed the further\nslope, and brought the carriage to the other side of the peninsula,\nwhere the girls obtained their first view of the Gulf of Salerno, with\nthe lovely Isles of the Sirens lying just beneath them.\n\nAnd now they were on the great road that skirts the coast as far as\nSalerno, and has no duplicate in all the known world. For it is cut from\nthe solid rock of precipitous cliffs rising straight from the sea, which\nthe highway overhangs at an average height of five hundred feet, the\ntraveller being protected only by a low stone parapet from the vast gulf\nthat yawns beneath. And on the other side of the road the cliffs\ncontinue to ascend a like distance toward the sky, their irregular\nsurfaces dotted with wonderful houses that cling to the slopes, and\nvineyards that look as though they might slip down at any moment upon\nthe heads of timorous pilgrims.\n\nWhen it rained they put up the carriage top, which afforded but partial\nshelter. The shower was brief, but was shortly followed by hail as big\nas peas, which threatened to dash in the frail roof of their _carrozza_.\nWhile they shrank huddled beneath the blankets, the sun came out\nsuddenly, and the driver shed his leathern apron, cracked his whip, and\nbegan singing merrily as the vehicle rolled over the smooth road.\n\nOur travellers breathed again, and prepared to enjoy once more the\nwonderful vistas that were unfolded at every turn of the winding way.\nSometimes they skirted a little cove where, hundreds of feet below, the\nfishermen sat before their tiny huts busily mending their nets. From\nthat distance the boats drawn upon the sheltered beach seemed like mere\ntoys. Then they would span a chasm on a narrow stone bridge, or plunge\nthrough an arch dividing the solid mountain. But ever the road returned\nin a brief space to the edge of the sea-cliff, and everywhere it was\nsolid as the hills themselves, and seemingly as secure.\n\nThey had just sighted the ancient town of Positano and were circling a\ngigantic point of rock, when the great adventure of the day overtook\nthem. Without warning the wind came whistling around them in a great\ngale, which speedily increased in fury until it drove the blinded horses\nreeling against the low parapet and pushed upon the carriage as if\ndetermined to dash it over the precipice.\n\nAs it collided against the stone wall the vehicle tipped dangerously,\nhurling the driver from his seat to dive headforemost into the space\nbeneath. But the man clung to the reins desperately, and they arrested\nhis fall, leaving him dangling at the end of them while the maddened\nhorses, jerked at the bits by the weight of the man, reared and plunged\nas if they would in any instant tumble themselves and the carriage over\nthe cliff.\n\nAt this critical moment a mounted horseman, who unobserved had been\nfollowing the party, dashed to their rescue. The rider caught the\nplunging steeds by their heads and tried to restrain their terror, at\nhis own eminent peril, while the carriage lay wedged against the wall\nand the driver screamed pitifully from his dangerous position midway\nbetween sea and sky.\n\nThen Beth slipped from her seat to the flat top of the parapet, stepped\nboldly to where the reins were pulling upon the terrified horses, and\nseized them in her strong grasp.\n\n\"Hold fast,\" she called calmly to the driver, and began dragging him\nupward, inch by inch.\n\nHe understood instantly the task she had undertaken, and in a moment his\ncourage returned and he managed to get his foot in a crack of the rock\nand assist her by relieving her of part of his weight. Just above was a\nslight ledge; he could reach it now; and then she had him by the arm, so\nthat another instant found him clinging to the parapet and drawing\nhimself into a position of safety.\n\nThe wind had died away as suddenly as it came upon them. The horses, as\nsoon as the strain upon their bits was relaxed, were easily quieted.\nBefore those in the carriage had quite realized what had occurred the\nadventure was accomplished, the peril was past, and all was well again.\n\nUncle John leaped from the carriage, followed by Louise and Patsy. The\nyoung horseman who had come to their assistance so opportunely was none\nother than Count Ferralti, whom they had such good reason to distrust.\nHe was sitting upon his horse and staring with amazement at Beth, at\nwhose feet the driver was grovelling while tears flowed down his bronzed\ncheeks and he protested in an absurd mixture of English and Italian, by\nevery saint in the calendar, that the girl had saved him from a\nfrightful death and he would devote his future life to her service.\n\n\"It is wonderful!\" murmured Ferralti. \"However could such a slip of a\ngirl do so great a deed?\"\n\n\"Why, it's nothing at all,\" returned Beth, flushing; \"we're trained to\ndo such things in the gymnasium at Cloverton, and I'm much stronger than\nI appear to be.\"\n\n\"'Twas her head, mostly,\" said Patsy, giving her cousin an admiring hug;\n\"she kept her wits while the rest of us were scared to death.\"\n\nUncle John had been observing the Count. One of the young man's hands\nhung limp and helpless.\n\n\"Are you hurt, sir?\" he asked.\n\nFerralti smiled, and his eyes rested upon Louise.\n\n\"A little, perhaps, Mr. Merrick; but it is unimportant. The horses were\nfrantic at the time and wrenched my wrist viciously as I tried to hold\nthem. I felt something snap; a small bone, perhaps. But I am sure it is\nnothing of moment.\"\n\n\"We'd better get back to Sorrento,\" said Uncle John, abruptly.\n\n\"Not on my account, I beg of you,\" returned Ferralti, quickly. \"We are\nhalf way to Amalfi now, and you may as well go on. For my part, if the\nwrist troubles me, I will see a surgeon at Amalfi--that is, if you\npermit me to accompany you.\"\n\nHe said this with a defferent bow and a glance of inquiry.\n\nUncle John could not well refuse. The young fellow might be a sham\ncount, but the manliness and courage he had displayed in their grave\nemergency surely entitled him to their grateful consideration.\n\n\"You are quite welcome to join us,\" said Uncle John.\n\nThe driver had by now repaired a broken strap and found his equippage\notherwise uninjured.\n\nThe horses stood meekly quiescent, as if they had never known a moment's\nfear in their lives. So the girls and their uncle climbed into the\nvehicle again and the driver mounted the box and cracked his whip with\nhis usual vigor.\n\nThe wind had subsided as suddenly as it had arisen, and as they passed\nthrough Positano--which is four hundred feet high, the houses all up and\ndown the side of a cliff like swallows' nests--big flakes of snow were\ngently falling around them.\n\nCount Ferralti rode at the side of the carriage but did not attempt much\nconversation. His lips were tight set and the girls, slyly observing his\nface, were sure his wrist was hurting him much more than he cared to\nacknowledge.\n\nCircling around the cliff beyond Positano the sun greeted them, shining\nfrom out a blue sky, and they wondered what had become of the bad\nweather they had so lately experienced.\n\nFrom now on, past Prajano and into Amalfi, the day was brilliant and the\ntemperature delightful. It was full noon by the time they alighted at\nthe little gate-house of the ancient Cappuccini-Convento, now a hotel\nmuch favored by the tourist. Count Ferralti promised to join them later\nand rode on to the town to find a surgeon to look after his injured\nhand, while the others slowly mounted the long inclines leading in a\nzigzag fashion up to the old monastery, which was founded in the year\n1212.\n\nFrom the arbored veranda of this charming retreat is obtained one of the\nfinest views in Europe, and while the girls sat enjoying it Uncle John\narranged with a pleasant faced woman (who had once lived in America) for\ntheir luncheon.\n\nAn hour later, and just as they were sitting down to the meal, Count\nFerralti rejoined them. His hand was bandaged and supported by a sling,\nand in answer to Louise's gentle inquiries he said, simply:\n\n\"It was as I had feared: a small bone snapped. But my surgeon is\nskillful, and says time will mend the wrist as good as new.\"\n\nIn spite of his courage he could eat no luncheon, but merely sipped a\nglass of wine; so Uncle John, alarmed at his pallor, insisted that he\ntake a seat in the carriage on the return journey. Beth wanted to ride\nthe Count's horse home, but there was no side saddle to be had, so they\nled the animal by a halter fastened behind the ricketty carriage, and\nBeth mounted the box and rode beside her friend the driver.\n\nThe pleasant weather lasted until they neared Sorrento, when another\nshower of rain came up. They reached their hotel damp and bedraggled,\nbut enthusiastic over their wonderful trip and the interesting adventure\nit had incidentally developed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE EAGLE SCREAMS\n\n\nDespite the glories of the Amalfi road our tourists decided it was more\npleasant to loiter around Sorrento for a time than to undertake further\nexcursions. The mornings and evenings were chill, but during the middle\nof the day the air was warm and delicious; so the girls carried their\nbooks and fancy-work into the beautiful gardens or wandered lazily\nthrough the high-walled lanes that shut in the villas and orange groves.\nSometimes they found a gate open, and were welcomed to the orchards and\npermitted to pluck freely the fragrant and rich flavored fruit, which is\nexcelled in no other section of the south country. Also Uncle John, with\nBeth and Patsy, frequented the shops of the wood-workers and watched\ntheir delicate and busy fingers inlaying the various colored woods; but\nLouise mostly kept to the garden, where Count Ferralti, being a\nsemi-invalid, was content to sit by her side and amuse her.\n\nIn spite of her uncle's discovery of the false position assumed by this\nyoung man, Louise seemed to like his attentions and to approve his\nevident admiration for her. His ways might be affected and effeminate\nand his conversational powers indifferent; but his bandaged wrist was a\nconstant reminder to all the nieces that he possessed courage and ready\nwit, and it was but natural that he became more interesting to them\nbecause just now he was to an extent helpless, and his crippled hand had\nbeen acquired in their service.\n\nUncle John watched the young fellow shrewdly, but could discover little\nharm in him except his attempt to deceive them in regard to his name and\nposition. Yet in his mature eyes there was not much about Ferralti to\narouse admiration, and the little man considered his girls too sensible\nto be greatly impressed by this youthful Italian's personality. So he\nallowed him to sit with his nieces in the gardens as much as he\npleased, believing it would be ungrateful to deprive the count of that\nharmless recreation.\n\n\"A reg'lar chaperone might think differently,\" he reflected; \"but thank\ngoodness there are no dragons swimming in our cup of happiness.\"\n\nOne day they devoted to Capri and the Blue Grotto, and afterward they\nlunched at the Quisisana and passed the afternoon in the town. But the\ncharms of Sorrento were too great for Capri to win their allegiance, and\nthey were glad to get back to their quaint town and delightful gardens\nagain.\n\nThe week passed all too swiftly, and then came a letter from Colonel\nAngeli telling them to return to Naples and witness the results of the\neruption. This they decided to do, and bidding good-bye to Signor\nFloriano and his excellent hotel they steamed across the bay and found\nthe \"Vesuve\" a vastly different hostelry from the dismal place they had\nleft in their flight from Naples. It was now teeming with life, for, all\ndanger being past, the tourists had flocked to the city in droves. The\ntown was still covered with ashes, but under the brilliant sunshine it\ndid not look as gloomy as one might imagine, and already thousands of\ncarts were busily gathering the dust from the streets and dumping it in\nthe waters of the bay. It would require months of hard work, though,\nbefore Naples could regain a semblance of its former beauty.\n\nTheir friend the Colonel personally accompanied them to the towns that\nhad suffered the most from the eruption. At Boscatrecasa they walked\nover the great beds of lava that had demolished the town--banks of\ncinders looking like lumps of pumice stone and massed from twenty to\nthirty feet in thickness throughout the valley. The lava was still so\nhot that it was liable to blister the soles of their feet unless they\nkept constantly moving. It would be many more days before the interior\nof the mass became cold.\n\nThrough the forlorn, dust-covered vineyards they drove to San Guiseppe,\nwhere a church roof had fallen in and killed one hundred and forty\npeople, maiming many more. The Red-Cross tents were pitched in the\nstreets and the whole town was one vast hospital. Ottajano, a little\nnearer to the volcano, had been buried in scoria, and nine-tenths of\nthe roofs had fallen in, rendering the dwellings untenable.\n\nFrom here a clear view of Mt. Vesuvius could be obtained. The shape of\nthe mountain had greatly altered and the cone had lost sixty-five feet\nof its altitude. But when one gazed upon the enormous bulk of volcanic\ndeposit that littered the country for miles around, it seemed to equal a\ndozen mountains the size of Vesuvius. The marvel was that so much ashes\nand cinders could come from a single crater in so short a period.\n\nNaples was cleaning house, but slowly and listlessly. The people seemed\nas cheerful and light-hearted as ever. The volcano was one of their\ncrosses, and they bore it patiently. The theatres would remain closed\nfor some weeks to come, but the great Museo Nationale was open, and\nUncle John and his nieces were much interested in the bronze and marble\nstatuary that here form the greatest single collection in all the world.\n\nIt was at the Museum that Mr. Merrick was arrested for the first time\nin his life, an experience he never afterward forgot.\n\nBad money is so common in Naples that Uncle John never accepted any\nchange from anyone, but obtained all his silver coins and notes directly\nfrom the Banca Commerciale Italiana, a government institution. One\nmorning he drove with the girls to the museum and paid the cabman a\nlira, but before he could ascend the steps the man was after him and\nholding out a leaden coin, claiming that his fare had given him bad\nmoney and must exchange it for good. This is so common a method of\nswindling that Uncle John paid no heed to the demands of the cabman\nuntil one of the Guard Municipale, in his uniform of dark blue with\nyellow buttons and cap, placed a restraining hand upon the American's\nshoulder.\n\nUncle John angrily shook him off, but the man persisted, and an\ninterpreter employed by the museum stepped forward and explained that\nunless the cabman was given a good coin in exchange for the bad one the\nguarde would be obliged to take him before a commissionaire, or\nmagistrate.\n\n\"But I gave him a good coin--a lira direct from the bank,\" declared\nUncle John.\n\n\"He exhibits a bad one,\" returned the interpreter, calmly.\n\n\"He's a swindler!\"\n\n\"He is a citizen of Naples, and entitled to a just payment,\" said the\nother, shrugging his shoulders.\n\n\"You are all leagued together,\" said Uncle John, indignantly. \"But you\nwill get no more money out of me, I promise you.\"\n\nThe result was that the stubborn American was placed under arrest.\nLeaving the girls at the museum in charge of Ferralti, who had made no\nattempt to interfere in the dispute but implored Uncle John to pay and\navoid trouble, the angry prisoner was placed in the same cab he had\narrived in and, with the officer seated beside him, was publicly driven\nto the office of the magistrate.\n\nThis official understood no English, but he glowered and frowned\nfiercely when the American was brought before him. The guarde and the\ncabman stood with bared bowed heads and in low tones preferred the\ncharge against the prisoner; but Uncle John swaggered up to the desk and\npounded his clinched fist upon it while he roared a defiance of Italian\ninjustice and threatened to \"bring over a few war-ships and blow Naples\ninto kingdom come!\"\n\nThe magistrate was startled, and ordered the prisoner searched for\nconcealed weapons. Uncle John doubled his fists and dared the guarde to\ntouch him.\n\nThen the cabman was dispatched for someone who could speak English, and\nwhen an interpreter arrived the American told him to send for the United\nStates consul and also to inform the magistrate that nothing but war\nbetween America and Italy could wipe out the affront that had been\nthrust upon him.\n\nThe magistrate was disturbed, and preferred not to send for the consul.\nHe offered to release Uncle John if he would give the cabman a good lira\nin exchange for the bad one. The official fee would be five lira--or say\nthree lira--or even two. Uncle John flatly refused to pay anything to\nanybody. Only war could settle this international complication--bloody\nand bitter war. The consul must cable at once for war-ships and troops.\nHe would insist upon it. All compromise was now impossible!\n\nThe magistrate was frightened. The guarde's eyes bulged with horror and\nhe trembled visibly. It was evident they had made a grave mistake in\narresting this mad American, who was evidently a personage of great\nimportance and able to declare war at a moment's notice. The cabman, the\nmagistrate, the guarde and the interpreter put their heads together and\nchattered voluble Italian--all speaking at once in excited tones--while\nUncle John continued to warn them at the top of his lungs that their\ncountry was doomed to sudden annihilation and they were the culprits\nresponsible for the coming calamity.\n\nAs a result they bundled the irate American into the carriage again and\ndrove him poste haste back to the museum, where they deposited him upon\nthe steps. Then in a flash the guarde and the cabman disappeared from\nsight and were seen no more.\n\nThe victor smiled proudly as his nieces rushed toward him.\n\n\"Did you have to pay another lira, Uncle?\" asked Patsy, anxiously.\n\n\"Not on your life, my dear,\" mopping his brow vigorously. \"They're a lot\nof cutthroats and assassins--policemen, magistrates and all--but when\nthe eagle screams they're wise enough to duck.\"\n\nThe girls laughed.\n\n\"And did the eagle scream, then?\" Patsy enquired.\n\n\"Just a little, my dear; but if it whispered it would sound mighty loud\nin this mummified old world. But we've lost enough time for one day.\nCome; let's go see 'Narcissus' and the 'Dancing Faun.'\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nMOVING ON\n\n\n\"Here's a letter from my dear old friend Silas Watson,\" said Uncle John,\ndelightedly. \"It's from Palermo, where he has been staying with his\nward--and your friend, girls--Kenneth Forbes, and he wants me to lug you\nall over to Sicily at once.\"\n\n\"That's jolly,\" said Patsy, with a bright smile. \"I'd like to see\nKenneth again.\"\n\n\"I suppose he is a great artist, by this time,\" said Beth, musingly.\n\n\"How singular!\" exclaimed Louise. \"Count Ferralti told me only this\nmorning that he had decided to go to Palermo.\"\n\n\"Really?\" said Uncle John.\n\n\"Yes, Uncle. Isn't it a coincidence?\"\n\n\"Why, as for that,\" he answered, slowly, \"I'm afraid it will prevent our\nseeing the dear count--or whatever he is--again, at least for some\ntime. For Mr. Watson and Kenneth are just leaving Palermo, and he asks\nus to meet him in another place altogether, a town called--called--let\nme see; Tormenti, or Terminal, or something.\"\n\n\"Give me the letter, dear,\" said Patsy. \"I don't believe it's Terminal\nat all. Of course not,\" consulting the pages, \"it's Taormina.\"\n\n\"Is that in Sicily?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes. Listen to what Mr. Watson says: 'I'm told it is the most beautiful\nspot in the world, which is the same thing you hear about most beautiful\nplaces. It is eight hundred feet above the Mediterranean and nestles\npeacefully in the shadow of Mount Etna.'\"\n\n\"Etna!\" cried Uncle John, with a start. \"Isn't that another volcano?\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" said Beth, the geographer. \"Etna is the biggest volcano in\nthe world.\"\n\n\"Does it spout?\" he asked, anxiously.\n\n\"All the time, they say. But it is not usually dangerous.\"\n\n\"The proper thing, when you go to Eu-rope,\" declared Uncle John,\npositively, \"is to do Venice, where the turpentine comes from, and\nSwitzerland, where they make chocolate and goat's milk, and Paris and\nMonte Carlo, where they kick high and melt pearls in champagne.\nEverybody knows that. That's what goin' to Eu-rope really means. But\nSicily isn't on the programme, that I ever heard of. So we'll just tell\nSilas Watson that we'll see him later--which means when we get home\nagain.\"\n\n\"But Sicily is beautiful,\" protested Patsy. \"I'd as soon go there as\nanywhere.\"\n\n\"It's a very romantic place,\" added Louise, reflectively.\n\n\"Everybody goes to France and Switzerland,\" remarked Beth. \"But it's\nbecause they don't know any better. Let's be original, Uncle, and keep\nout of the beaten track of travel.\"\n\n\"But the volcano!\" exclaimed Mr. Merrick. \"Is it necessary to stick to\nvolcanoes to be original?\"\n\n\"Etna won't hurt us, I'm sure,\" said Patsy.\n\n\"Isn't there a Greek theatre at Taormina?\" asked Louise.\n\n\"I've never heard of it; but I suppose the Greeks have, if it's there,\"\nhe replied. \"But why not wait till we get home, and then go to Kieth's\nor Hammerstein's?\"\n\n\"You don't understand, dear. This theatre is very ancient.\"\n\n\"Playing minstrel shows in it yet, I suppose. Well, girls, if you say\nSicily, Sicily it is. All I'm after is to give you a good time, and if\nyou get the volcano habit it isn't my fault.\"\n\n\"It is possible the Count said Taormina, instead of Palermo,\" remarked\nLouise, plaintively. \"I wasn't paying much attention at the time. I'll\nask him.\"\n\nThe others ignored this suggestion. Said Patsy to her uncle:\n\n\"When do we go, sir?\"\n\n\"Whenever you like, my dears.\"\n\n\"Then I vote to move on at once,\" decided the girl. \"We've got the best\nout of Naples, and it's pretty grimey here yet.\"\n\nThe other nieces agreed with her, so Uncle John went out to enquire the\nbest way to get to Sicily, and to make their arrangements.\n\nThe steamer \"Victor Emmanuel\" of the Navigazione General Italiana line\nwas due to leave Naples for Messina the next evening, arriving at its\ndestination the following morning. Uncle John promptly booked places.\nThe intervening day was spent in packing and preparing for the journey,\nand like all travellers the girls were full of eager excitement at the\nprospect of seeing something new.\n\n\"I'm told Sicily is an island,\" grumbled Uncle John. \"Here we are, on a\ntrip to Eu-rope, and emigrating to an island the first thing we do.\"\n\n\"Sicily is Europe, all right, Uncle,\" answered Patsy. \"At least, it\nisn't Asia or Africa.\"\n\nThat assertion seemed to console him a little, and he grew cheerful\nagain.\n\nThe evening was beautiful as they embarked, but soon after leaving the\nbay the little, tub-shaped steamer began to tumble and toss vigorously,\nso that all the passengers aboard speedily sought their berths.\n\nUncle John found himself in a stuffy little cabin that smelled of tar\nand various other flavors that were too mixed to be recognizable. As a\nresult he passed one of the most miserable nights of his life.\n\nToward morning he rolled out and dressed himself, preferring the deck to\nhis bed, and the first breath of salt air did much to restore him. Day\nwas just breaking, and to the right he could see a tongue of fire\nflaming against the dark sky.\n\n\"What is that, sir?\" he enquired of an officer who passed.\n\n\"That is Stromboli, signor, the great volcano of Lipari. It is always in\neruption.\"\n\nUncle John groaned.\n\n\"Volcanoes to right of us, volcanoes to left of us volleyed and\nthundered,\" he muttered dismally, as he fell back in his chair.\n\nThe sky brightened, and the breath of the breeze changed and came to him\nladen with delicious fragrance.\n\n\"See, signore!\" called the officer, passing again; \"before us is mighty\nEtna--you can see it clearly from the bow.\"\n\n\"Volcanoes in front of us, volcanoes behind us!\" wailed the little man.\nBut he walked to the bow and saw the shores of Sicily looming in\nadvance, with the outline of the stately mountain rising above and\ndominating it.\n\nThen the sun burst forth, flooding all with a golden radiance that was\nmagical in its gorgeous effects. Patsy came on deck and stood beside her\nuncle, lost in rapturous admiration. Beth soon followed her.\n\nBefore long they entered the Straits of Messina and passed between the\nclassic rock of Scylla on the Calabrian coast, and the whirlpool of\nCharybdis at the point of the promontory of Faro, which forms the end of\nthe famous \"Golden Sickle\" enclosing the Bay of Messina.\n\n\"If this is really Eu-rope, I'm glad we came,\" said Uncle John, drawing\na long breath as the ship came to anchor opposite the Palazzo\nMunicipale. \"I don't remember seeing anything prettier since we left New\nYork.\"\n\nPresently they had loaded their trunks and hand baggage, and\nincidentally themselves, into the boat of the Hotel Trinacria which came\nalongside in charge of a sleepy porter. After a brief examination at the\ncustom-house, where Uncle John denied having either sugar, tobacco or\nperfumery, they followed on foot the truck laden with their worldly\npossessions, and soon reached the hotel.\n\nA pleasant breakfast followed, which they ate before a window\noverlooking the busy marina, and then they drove about the town for a\ntime to see in a casual way the \"sights.\" In the afternoon they took the\ntrain for Taormina. Messina seemed a delightful place, but if they were\ngoing to settle in Taormina for a time it would not pay them to unpack\nor linger on the way.\n\nSo they rolled along the coast for a couple of hours in a quaint,\nold-fashioned railway carriage, and were then deposited upon the\nplatform of the little station at Giardini.\n\n\"I'm afraid there has been a mistake,\" said the little man, gazing\naround him anxiously. \"There's no town here, and I told the guard to put\nus off at Taormina--not this forlorn place.\"\n\nJust then Beth discovered a line of carriages drawn up back of the\nstation. The drivers were mostly asleep inside them, although several\nstood in a group arguing in fluent Italian the grave question as to\nwhether Signora Gani's cow had a black patch over its left shoulder, or\nnot.\n\nSome of the carriages bore signs: \"Hotel Timeo;\" \"Grand Hotel San\nDomenico;\" \"Hotel Castello-a-Mare;\" \"Grand Hotel Metropole,\" and so\nforth. In that of the Castello-a-Mare the man was awakening and rubbing\nhis eyes. Uncle John said to him:\n\n\"Good morning. Had a nice rest?\"\n\n\"I thank you, signore, I am well refreshed,\" was the reply.\n\n\"By the way, can you tell us where the town of Taormina is? I hate to\ntrouble you; but we'd like to know.\"\n\nThe man waved an arm upward, and following the motion with their eyes\nthey saw a line of precipitous cliffs that seemed impossible to scale.\n\n\"Do you desire to go to the Grand Hotel Castello-a-Mare?\" enquired the\ndriver, politely.\n\n\"Is it in Taormina?\"\n\n\"Most certainly, signore.\"\n\n\"And you will take us?\"\n\n\"With pleasure, signore.\"\n\n\"Oh; I didn't know. I supposed you were going to sleep again.\"\n\nThe man looked at him reproachfully.\n\n\"It is my business, signore. I am very attentive to my duties. If you\npermit me to drive you to our splendide--our magnifico hotel--you will\nconfer a favor.\"\n\n\"How about the baggage?\"\n\n\"The trunks, signor, we will send for later. There is really no hurry\nabout them. The small baggage will accompany us. You will remark how\nexcellent is my English. I am Frascatti Vietri; perhaps you have heard\nof me in America?\"\n\n\"If I have it has escaped my memory,\" said Uncle John, gravely.\n\n\"Have you been to America?\" asked Beth.\n\n\"Surely, signorina. I lived in Chicago, which, as you are aware, is\nAmerica. My uncle had a fruit shop in South Water, a via which is\nChicago. Is it not so? You will find few in Taormina who can the English\nspeak, and none at all who can so perfectly speak it as Frascatti\nVietri.\"\n\n\"You are wonderful,\" said Patsy, delighted with him. But Uncle John\ngrew impatient to be off.\n\n\"I hate to interrupt you, Mr. Vietri,\" he hinted; \"but if you can spare\nthe time we may as well make a start.\"\n\nThe driver consented. He gracefully swung the suit-cases and travelling\nbags to the top of the vehicle and held the door open while his fares\nentered. Then he mounted to his seat, took the reins, and spoke to the\nhorses. Some of the other drivers nodded at him cheerfully, but more as\nif they were sorry he must exert himself than with any resentment at his\nsuccess in getting the only tourists who had alighted from the train.\n\nAs they moved away Uncle John said: \"Observe the difference between the\ncab-drivers here and those at home. In America they fight like beasts to\nget a job; here they seem anxious to avoid earning an honest penny. If\nthere could be a happy medium somewhere, I'd like it.\"\n\n\"Are we going to the best hotel?\" asked Louise, who had seemed a trifle\ndisconsolate because she had not seen Count Ferralti since leaving\nNaples.\n\n\"I don't know, my dear. It wasn't a question of choice, but of\nnecessity. No other hotel seemed willing to receive us.\"\n\nThey were now winding upward over a wonderful road cut in the solid\nrock. It was broad and smooth and protected by a parapet of dressed\nlimestone. Now and then they passed pleasant villas set in orchards of\ngolden oranges or groves of olives and almonds; but there was no sign of\nlife on any side.\n\nThe road was zigzag, making a long ascent across the face of the cape,\nthen turning abruptly to wind back again, but always creeping upward\nuntil an open space showed the station far below and a rambling stone\nbuilding at the edge of the cliff far above.\n\n\"Behold!\" cried Frascatti, pointing up, \"the Grand Hotel\nCastello-a-Mare; is it not the excellenza location?\"\n\n\"Has it a roof?\" asked Uncle John, critically.\n\n\"Of a certainty, signore! But it does not show from below,\" was the\ngrave reply.\n\nAt times Frascatti stopped his horses to allow them to rest, and then he\nwould turn in his seat to address his passengers in the open victoria\nand descant upon the beauties of the panorama each turn unfolded.\n\n\"This road is new,\" said he, \"because we are very progressive and the\nold road was most difficulty. Then it was three hours from the bottom to\nthe top. Now it is but a short hour, for our energy climbs the three\nmiles in that brief time. Shall I stop here for the sunset, or will your\nexcellenzi hasten on?\"\n\n\"If your energy approves, we will hasten,\" returned Uncle John. \"We love\na sunset, because it's bound to set anyway, and we may as well make the\nbest of it; but we have likewise an objection to being out after dark.\nAny brigands around here?\"\n\n\"Brigands! Ah; the signor is merry. Never, since the days of Naxos, have\nbrigands infested our fair country.\"\n\n\"When were the days of Naxos?\"\n\n\"Some centuries before Christ, signor,\" bowing his head and making the\nsign of the cross.\n\n\"Very good. The brigands of those days must, of course, be dead by this\ntime. Now, sir, when you have leisure, let us hasten.\"\n\nThe horses started and crept slowly upward again. None of the party was\nin a hurry. Such beautiful glimpses of scenery were constantly visible\nfrom the bends of the road that the girls were enraptured, and could\nhave ridden for hours in this glorious fairyland.\n\nBut suddenly the horses broke into a trot and dragged the carriage\nrapidly forward over the last incline. A moment later they dashed into\nthe court of the hotel and the driver with a loud cry of \"Oo-ah!\" and a\ncrack of his whip drew up before the entrance.\n\nThe portiere and the padrone, or landlord--the latter being also the\nproprietaire--came out to greet them, extending to their guests a\ncourteous welcome. The house was very full. All of the cheaper rooms\nwere taken; but of course the Signor Americain would wish only the best\nand be glad to pay.\n\nUncle John requested them to rob him as modestly as possible without\nconflicting with their sense of duty, and they assured him they would do\nso.\n\nThe rooms were adorable. They faced the sea and had little balconies\nthat gave one a view of the blue Mediterranean far beneath, with lovely\nIsola Bella and the Capo San Andrea nestling on its bosom. To the right\ntowered the majestic peak of Etna, its crest just now golden red in the\ndying sunset.\n\nThe girls drew in deep breaths and stood silent in a very ecstacy of\ndelight. At their feet was a terraced garden, running downward two\nhundred feet to where the crag fell sheer to the sea. It was glorious\nwith blooming flowers of every sort that grows, and the people on the\nbalconies imagined at the moment they had been transferred to an earthly\nparadise too fair and sweet for ordinary mortals. And then the glow of\nthe sun faded softly and twilight took its place. Far down the winding\nroad could be seen the train of carriages returning from the station,\nthe vetturini singing their native songs as the horses slowly ascended\nthe slope. An unseen organ somewhere in the distance ground out a\nNeapolitan folk song, and fresh and youthful voices sang a clear, high\ntoned accompaniment.\n\nEven practical Uncle John stood absorbed and admiring until the soft\nvoice of the facchino called to ask if he wanted hot water in which to\nbathe before dinner.\n\n\"It's no use,\" said Patsy, smiling at him from the next balcony with\ntears in her eyes; \"There's not another Taormina on earth. Here we are,\nand here we stay until we have to go home again.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, think of Paris, of Venice, of--\"\n\n\"I'll think of nothing but this, Uncle John. Unless you settle down with\nus here I'll turn milkmaid and live all my days in Sicily!\"\n\nBeth laughed, and drew her into their room.\n\n\"Don't be silly, Patsy dear,\" she said, calmly, although almost as\ngreatly affected as her cousin. \"There are no cows here, so you can't be\na milkmaid.\"\n\n\"Can't I milk the goats, then?\"\n\n\"Why, the men seem to do that, dear. But cheer up. We've only seen the\nromance of Taormina yet; doubtless it will be commonplace enough\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nIL DUCA\n\n\nBeth's prediction, however, did not come true. The morning discovered\nnothing commonplace about Taormina. Their hotel was outside the walls,\nbut a brief walk took them to the Messina Gate, a quaint archway through\nwhich they passed into the narrow streets of one of the oldest towns in\nSicily. Doorways and windows of Saracen or Norman construction faced\nthem on every side, and every inch of the ancient buildings was\npicturesque and charming.\n\nSome of the houses had been turned into shops, mostly for the sale of\ncurios. Uncle John and his nieces had scarcely passed a hundred yards\ninto the town when one of these shops arrested their attention. It was\nfull of antique jewelry, antique furniture, antique laces and antique\npottery--all of the most fascinating description. The jewelry was\ntarnished and broken, the lace had holes in it and the furniture was\ndecrepit and unsteady; but the proprietor cared nothing for such\ndefects. All was very old, and he knew the tourist was eager to buy. So\nhe scattered his wares inside and outside his salesroom, much as the\nspider spreads his web for the unwary, and waited for the inevitable\ntourist with a desire to acquire something ancient and useless.\n\nThe girls could not be induced to pass the shop. They entered the\nsquare, low room and flooded the shopman with eager questions.\nNotwithstanding Frascatti's assertion that few in Taormina could speak\nEnglish, this man was quite intelligible and fixed his prices according\nto the impression his wares made upon the artistic sense of the young\nAmerican ladies.\n\nIt was while they were intently inspecting some laces that the\nproprietor suddenly paused in his chatter, removed his hat and bowed\nalmost to the floor, his face assuming at the same time a serious and\nmost humble expression.\n\nTurning around they saw standing outside the door a man whom they\nrecognized at once as their fellow passenger aboard the \"Princess\nIrene.\"\n\n\"Oh, Signor Valdi!\" cried Patsy, running toward him, \"how strange to\nfind you again in this out-of-the-way place.\"\n\nThe Italian frowned, but in a dignified manner took the hand of all\nthree girls in turn and then bowed a greeting to Mr. Merrick.\n\nUncle John thought the fellow had improved in appearance. Instead of the\nflannel shirt and Prince Albert coat he had affected on shipboard he now\nwore a native costume of faded velvet, while a cloak of thin but\nvoluminous cloth swung from his shoulders, and a soft felt hat shaded\nhis dark eyes.\n\nHis appearance was entirely in keeping with the place, and the American\nnoticed that the villagers who passed doffed their hats most\nrespectfully to this seemingly well-known individual. But mingled with\ntheir polite deference was a shyness half fearful, and none stopped to\nspeak but hurried silently on.\n\n\"And how do we happen to find you here, Signor Valdi?\" Patsy was\nsaying. \"Do you live in Taormina?\"\n\n\"I am of this district, but not of Taormina,\" he replied. \"It is chance\nthat you see me here. Eh, Signor Bruggi, is it not so?\" casting one of\nhis characteristic fierce glances at the shopkeeper.\n\n\"It is so, your excellency.\"\n\n\"But I am glad you have come to the shadow of Etna,\" he continued,\naddressing the Americans with slow deliberation. \"Here the grandeur of\nthe world centers, and life keeps time with Nature. You will like it?\nYou will stay?\"\n\n\"Oh, for a time, anyway,\" said Patsy.\n\n\"We expect to meet some friends here,\" explained Uncle John. \"They are\ncoming down from Palermo, but must have been delayed somewhere on the\nway.\"\n\n\"Who are they?\" asked Valdi, brusquely.\n\n\"Americans, of course; Silas Watson and Kenneth Forbes. Do you know of\nthem?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the other. He cast an uneasy glance up and down the street.\n\"I will meet you again, signorini,\" he added. \"Which is your hotel?\"\n\n\"The Castello-a-Mare. It is delightful,\" said Beth.\n\nHe nodded, as if pleased. Then, folding his cloak about him, he murmured\n\"adios!\" and stalked away without another word or look.\n\n\"Queer fellow,\" remarked Uncle John.\n\nThe shopkeeper drew a long breath and seemed relieved.\n\n\"Il Duca is unusual, signore,\" he replied.\n\n\"Duke!\" cried the girls, in one voice.\n\nThe man seemed startled.\n\n\"I--I thought you knew him; you seemed friends,\" he stammered.\n\n\"We met Signor Valdi on shipboard,\" said Uncle John.\n\n\"Valdi? Ah, yes; of course; the duke has been to America.\"\n\n\"Isn't his name Valdi?\" asked Beth, looking the man straight in the\neyes. \"Has he another name here, where he lives?\"\n\nThe shopman hesitated.\n\n\"Who knows?\" was the evasive reply. \"Il Duca has many names, but we do\nnot speak them. When it is necessary to mention him we use his\ntitle--the duke.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"Why, signorina? Why? Perhaps because he does not like to be talked\nabout. Yes; that is it, I am sure.\"\n\n\"Where does he live?\" asked Patsy.\n\nThe man seemed uneasy under so much questioning.\n\n\"Somewhere in the mountains,\" he said, briefly. \"His estates are there.\nHe is said to be very rich and powerful. I know nothing more,\nsignorini.\"\n\nRealizing that little additional information could be gleaned from this\nsource they soon left the shop and wandered into the Piazzo Vittorio\nEmanuele, and from thence by the narrow lane to the famous Teatro Greco.\n\nFor a time they admired this fascinating ruin, which has the best\npreserved stage of any Greek theatre now in existence. From the top of\nthe hill is one of the most magnificent views in Sicily, and here our\ntravellers sat in contemplative awe until Uncle John declared it was\ntime to return to their hotel for luncheon.\n\nAs they passed the portiere's desk Mr. Merrick paused to ask that\nimportant official:\n\n\"Tell me, if you please, who is Signor Victor Valdi?\"\n\n\"Valdi, signore?\"\n\n\"Yes; the Duke di Valdi, I suppose you call him.\"\n\n\"I have never heard of him,\" replied the man.\n\n\"But every one seems to know him in Taormina.\"\n\n\"Is it so? We have but one duke near to us, and he--. But never mind. I\ndo not know this Valdi.\"\n\n\"A thin faced man, with black eyes. We met him on the steamer coming\nfrom America.\"\n\nThe portiere dropped his eyes and turned toward his desk.\n\n\"Luncheon is served, signore,\" he remarked. \"Also, here is a letter for\nyou, which arrived this morning.\"\n\nUncle John took the letter and walked on to rejoin the girls.\n\n\"It seems hard work to find out anything about this Valdi,\" he said.\n\"Either the folks here do not know him, or they won't acknowledge his\nacquaintance. We may as well follow suit, and avoid him.\"\n\n\"I don't like his looks a bit,\" observed Beth. \"He seems afraid and\ndefiant at the same time, and his temper is dreadful. It was only with\ngreat difficulty he could bring himself to be polite to us.\"\n\n\"Oh, I always got along with him all right,\" said Patsy. \"I'm sure\nSignor Valdi isn't as bad as he appears. And he's a duke, too, girls--a\nreal duke!\"\n\n\"So it seems,\" Uncle John rejoined; \"yet there is something queer about\nthe fellow, I agree with Beth; I don't like him.\"\n\n\"Did Mr. Watson say when he would join us here?\" enquired Louise, when\nthey were seated at the little round table.\n\n\"No; but here's a letter from him. I'd quite forgotten it.\"\n\nHe tore open the envelope and carefully read the enclosure.\n\n\"Too bad,\" said he. \"We might have stayed a few days in Messina. Watson\nsays he and Kenneth have stopped at Girgenti--wherever that is--to study\nthe temples. Wonder if they're Solomon's? They won't get to Taormina\nbefore Saturday.\"\n\n\"It won't matter,\" declared Patsy, \"so long as they arrive then. And I'd\na good deal rather be here than in Messina, or any other place. Of\ncourse we'll all be glad to see Kenneth.\"\n\n\"Mr. Watson wants us to be very careful while we are in Sicily,\"\ncontinued Uncle John, referring to the letter. \"Listen to this: 'Don't\nlet the girls wear jewelry in public places, or display their watches\nopenly; and take care, all of you, not to show much money. If you buy\nanything, have it sent to your hotel to be paid for by the hall porter.\nAnd it is wise not to let anyone know who you are or how long you intend\nto remain in any one place. This may strike you as an absurd precaution;\nbut you must remember that you are not in America, but in an isolated\nItalian province, where government control is inefficient. The truth is\nthat the terrible Mafia is still all powerful on this island, and\nbrigandage is by no means confined to the neighborhood of\nCastrogiovanni, as the guide books would have you believe. The people\nseem simple and harmless enough, but Kenneth and I always keep our\nrevolvers handy, and believe it is a reasonable precaution. I don't want\nto frighten you, John; merely to warn you. Sicily is full of tourists,\nand few are ever molested; but if you are aware of the conditions\nunderlying the public serenity you are not so liable to run yourself and\nyour nieces into needless dangers.' How's that for a hair-curler,\ngirls?\"\n\n\"It sounds very romantic,\" said Louise, smiling. \"Mr. Watson is such a\ncautious man!\"\n\n\"But it's all rubbish about there being danger in Taormina,\" declared\nPatsy, indignantly. \"Mr. Watson has been in the wilds of the interior,\nwhich Baedecker admits is infested with brigands. Here everyone smiles\nat us in the friendliest way possible.\"\n\n\"Except the duke,\" added Beth, with a laugh.\n\n\"Oh, the duke is sour by nature,\" Patsy answered; \"but if there really\nwas danger, I'm sure he'd protect us, for he lives here and knows the\ncountry.\"\n\n\"You are sure of a lot of things, dear,\" said her cousin, smiling. \"But\nit will do no harm to heed the advice, and be careful.\"\n\nThey all agreed to that, and Uncle John was glad to remember he had two\nbrand new revolvers in the bottom of his trunk, which he could use in an\nemergency if he could manage to find the cartridges to load them with.\n\nHe got them out next morning, and warned his nieces not to touch the\ndangerous things when they entered his room. But Patsy laughed at him,\nsaying:\n\n\"You are behind the times, Uncle. Beth has carried a revolver ever since\nwe started.\"\n\n\"Beth!\" he cried, horrified.\n\n\"Just as a precaution,\" said that young lady, demurely.\n\n\"But you're only a child!\"\n\n\"Even so, Uncle, I have been taught to shoot in Cloverton, as a part of\nmy education. Once I won a medal--think of that! So I brought my pet\nrevolver along, although I may never have need to use it.\"\n\nUncle John looked thoughtful.\n\n\"It doesn't seem like a girlish accomplishment, exactly,\" he mused.\n\"When I was young and went into the West, the times were a bit\nunsettled, and I used to carry a popgun myself. But I never shot at a\nhuman being in my life. There were women in the camps that could shoot,\ntoo; but the safest place was always in front of them. If Beth has won a\nmedal, though, she might hit something.\"\n\n\"Don't try, Beth,\" said Louise; \"you ought to make a hit without\nshooting.\"\n\n\"Thank you, dear.\"\n\nAs they left their hotel for a walk they came upon Count Ferralti, who\nwas standing in the court calmly smoking a cigarette. His right hand was\nstill in a sling.\n\nNo one was greatly surprised at his appearance, but Uncle John uttered\nan exclamation of impatience. It annoyed him that this fellow, whose\nantecedents were decidedly cloudy, should be \"chasing around\" after one\nof his nieces, Beth and Patsy smiled at each other significantly as the\nyoung man was discovered, but Louise, with a slight blush, advanced to\ngreet Ferralti in her usual pleasant and cordial way.\n\nThere was no use resenting the intrusion. They owed a certain\nconsideration to this boyish Italian for his assistance on the Amalfi\nroad. But Uncle John almost wished he had left them to escape as best\nthey might, for the obligation was getting to be decidedly onerous.\n\nWhile Ferralti was expressing his astonishment at so \"unexpectedly\"\nmeeting again his American friends, Uncle John discovered their English\nspeaking cocchiere, Frascatti Vietri, lolling half asleep on the box of\nhis victoria.\n\n\"Would your energy like to drive us this morning?\" he asked.\n\n\"It is my duty, signore, if you wish to go,\" was the reply.\n\n\"Then you are engaged. Come, girls; hop in, if you want to ride.\"\n\nThe three nieces and Uncle John just filled the victoria. The count was\ndisconsolate at being so cleverly dropped from the party, but could\nonly flourish his hat and wish them a pleasant drive.\n\nThey descended the winding road to the coast, where Frascatti took the\nhighway to Sant' Alessio, a charming drive leading to the Taormina Pass.\n\n\"By the way,\" Uncle John asked the driver, \"do you know of a duke that\nlives in this neighborhood?\"\n\nThe laughing face of the Sicilian suddenly turned grave.\n\n\"No, signore. There is the Prince di Scaletta; but no duke on this side\nthe town.\"\n\n\"But on the other side?\"\n\n\"Oh; in the mountains? To be sure there are noblemen there; old estates\nalmost forgotten in our great civilization of to-day. We are very\nprogressive in Taormina, signore. There will be a fountain of the ice\ncream soda established next summer. Quite metropolitan, _ne c'e_?\"\n\n\"Quite. But, tell me, Frascatti, have you a duke in the mountains back\nof Taormina?\"\n\n\"Signore, I beg you to pay no attention to the foolish stories you may\nhear from our peasants. There has been no brigandage here for\ncenturies. I assure you the country is perfectionly safe--especial if\nyou stay within the town or take me on your drives. They know me,\nsignore, and even Il Duca dares not trifle with my friends.\"\n\n\"Why should he, Frascatti, if there is no brigandage? Is it the Mafia?\"\n\n\"Ah, I have heard that Mafia spoken of, but mostly when I lived in\nAmerica, which is Chicago. Here we do not know of the Mafia.\"\n\n\"But you advise us to be careful?\"\n\n\"Everywhere, illustrissimo signore, it is well to be what you call the\ncircumspection. I remember that in the State street of Chicago, which is\nAmerica, peaceful citizens were often killed by bandits. Eh, is it not\nso?\"\n\n\"Quite probable,\" said Uncle John, soberly.\n\n\"Then, what will you? Are we worse than Americans, that you fear us?\nNever mind Il Duca, or the tales they foolishly whisper of him. Here you\nmay be as safe and happy as in Chicago--which is America.\"\n\nHe turned to his horses and urged them up a slope. The girls and Uncle\nJohn eyed one another enquiringly.\n\n\"Our duke seems to bear no good reputation,\" said Beth, in a tone so low\nthat Frascatti could not overhear. \"Everyone fears to speak of him.\"\n\n\"Singular,\" said Uncle John, \"that Patsy's friend turns out to be a\nmystery, even in his own home. I wonder if he is a leader of the Mafia,\nor just a common brigand?\"\n\n\"In either case,\" said Patsy, \"he will not care to injure us, I am sure.\nWe all treated him very nicely, and I just made him talk and be\nsociable, whether he wanted to or not. That ought to count for something\nin our favor. But my opinion is that he's just a gruff old nobleman who\nlives in the hills and makes few friends.\"\n\n\"And hasn't a name, any more than Louise's count has. Is it customary,\nmy dear, for all Italian noblemen to conceal their identity?\"\n\n\"I do not know, Uncle,\" answered Louise, casting down her eyes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nUNCLE JOHN DISAPPEARS\n\n\nUncle John grew to love Taormina. Its wildness and ruggedness somehow\nreminded him of the Rockies in the old pioneer days, and he wandered\nthrough all the lanes of the quaint old town until he knew every cornice\nand cobblestone familiarly, and the women who sat weaving or mending\nbefore their squalid but picturesque hovels all nodded a greeting to the\ncheery little American as he passed by.\n\nHe climbed Malo, too, a high peak crowned by a ruined castle; and also\nMt. Venere, on the plateau of which an ancient city had once stood. His\nwalking tours did him good, and frequently while the girls lay stretched\nupon the grass that lined the theatre enclosure, to idle the time or\nread or write enthusiastic letters home, Uncle John, scorning such\nlaziness, would take his stick and climb mountains, or follow the rough\npaths that diverged from the highway just beyond the Catania Gate.\n\nThe tax gatherer whose tiny office was just inside the gate came to know\nthe little gentleman very well, and although he could speak no English\nhe would bob his grizzled head and murmur: \"_Buon giorno, signore!_\" as\nthe stranger passed out on his daily stroll.\n\nOne afternoon Mr. Merrick went down the hill path leading from the\nCastello-a-Mare to Capo di San Andrea, and as he passed around a narrow\nledge of rock came full upon two men seated upon a flat stone. One was\nValdi and the other Ferralti, and they seemed engaged in earnest\nconversation when he interrupted them. The Count smiled frankly and\ndoffed his hat; the Duke frowned grimly, but also nodded.\n\nUncle John passed on. The path was wild and little frequented. He felt\nin his side pocket and grasped the handle of his revolver; but there was\nno attempt to follow or molest him. Nevertheless, when he returned from\nthe beach he came up the longer winding roadway and was glad of the\ncompany of a ragged goatherd who, having no English, entertained \"Il\nSignore\" by singing ditties as he drove his goats before him.\n\nThe misgivings Uncle John had originally conceived concerning Count\nFerralti returned in full force with this incident; but he resolved to\nsay nothing of it to his nieces. Silas Watson would be with them in a\ncouple of days more and he would consult the shrewd lawyer before he\ntook any decisive action.\n\nNext morning after breakfast he left his nieces in the garden and said\nhe would take a walk through the town and along the highway west, toward\nKaggi.\n\n\"I'll be back in an hour or so,\" he remarked, \"for I have some letters\nto write and I want them to catch the noon mail.\"\n\nSo the girls sat on the terrace overlooking the sea and Etna, and\nbreathed the sweet air and enjoyed the caressing sunshine, until they\nnoticed the portiere coming hastily toward them.\n\n\"Pardon, signorini,\" he said, breathlessly, \"but it will be to oblige me\ngreatly if you will tell me where Signor Ferralti is.\"\n\n\"He is not of our party,\" answered Patsy, promptly; but Louise looked up\nas if startled, and said: \"I have been expecting him to join us here.\"\n\n\"Then you do not know?\" exclaimed the portiere, in an anxious tone.\n\n\"Know what, sir?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"That Signor Ferralti is gone. He has not been seen by any after last\nevening. He did not occupy his room. But worse, far worse, will I break\nyou the news gently--his baggage is gone with him!\"\n\n\"His baggage gone!\" echoed Louise, greatly disturbed. \"And he did not\ntell you? You did not see him go?\"\n\n\"Alas, no, signorina. His bill is still unsettled. He possessed two\nlarge travelling cases, which must have been carried out at the side\nentrance with stealth most deplorable. The padrone is worried. Signor\nFerralti is American, and Americans seldom treat us wrongfully.\"\n\n\"Signor Ferralti is Italian,\" answered Louise, stiffly.\n\n\"The name is Italian, perhaps; but he speaks only the English,\" declared\nthe portiere.\n\n\"He is not a rogue, however. Assure your master of that fact. When Mr.\nMerrick returns he will settle Count Ferralti's bill.\"\n\n\"Oh, Louise!\" gasped Patsy.\n\n\"I don't understand it in the least,\" continued Louise, looking at her\ncousins as if she were really bewildered. \"I left him in the courtyard\nlast evening to finish his cigar, and he said he would meet us in the\ngarden after breakfast. I am sure he had no intention of going away. And\nfor the honor of American travellers his account here must be taken care\nof.\"\n\n\"One thing is singular,\" observed Beth, calmly. \"There has been no train\nsince last you saw him. If Count Ferralti has left the hotel, where\ncould he be?\"\n\nThe portiere brightened.\n\n\"_Gia s'intende!_\" he exclaimed, \"he must still be in\nTaormina--doubtless at some other hotel.\"\n\n\"Will you send and find out?\" asked Louise.\n\n\"I will go myself, and at once,\" he answered. \"And thank you,\nsignorina, for the kind assurance regarding the account. It will relieve\nthe padrone very much.\"\n\nHe hurried away again, and an uneasy silence fell upon the nieces.\n\n\"Do you care for this young man. Louise?\" asked Beth, pointedly, after\nthe pause had become awkward.\n\n\"He is very attentive and gentlemanly, and I feel you have all wronged\nhim by your unjust suspicions,\" she replied, with spirit.\n\n\"That does not answer my question, dear,\" persisted her cousin. \"Are you\nespecially fond of him?\"\n\n\"What right have you to question me in this way, Beth?\"\n\n\"No right at all, dear. I am only trying to figure out our doubtful\nposition in regard to this young man--a stranger to all of us but you.\"\n\n\"It is really none of our business,\" observed Patsy, quickly. \"We're\njust a lot of gossips to be figuring on Count Ferralti at all. And\nalthough this sudden disappearance looks queer, on the face of it, the\ngentleman may simply have changed his boarding place.\"\n\n\"I do not think so,\" said Louise. \"He liked this hotel very much.\"\n\n\"And he may have liked some of its guests,\" added Patsy, smiling. \"Well,\nUncle John will soon be back, and then we will talk it over with him.\"\n\nUncle John was late. The portiere returned first. He had been to every\nhotel in the little town, but none of them had received a guest since\nthe afternoon train of yesterday. Count Ferralti had disappeared as if\nby magic, and no one could account for it.\n\nNoon arrived, but no Uncle John. The girls became dispirited and\nanxious, for the little man was usually very prompt in keeping his\nengagements, and always had returned at the set time.\n\nThey waited until the last moment and then entered the _salle a manger_\nand ate their luncheon in gloomy silence, hoping every moment to hear\nthe sound of their uncle's familiar tread.\n\nAfter luncheon they held a hurried consultation and decided to go into\ntown and search for him. So away they trooped, asking eager questions\nin their uncertain Italian but receiving no satisfactory reply until\nthey reached the little office of the tax gatherer at the Catania Gate.\n\n\"_Ah, si, signorini mia_,\" he answered, cheerfully, \"_il poco signore\npassato da stamattini._\"\n\nBut he had not returned?\n\nNot yet.\n\nThey looked at one another blankly.\n\n\"See here,\" said Patsy; \"Uncle John must have lost his way or met with\nan accident. You go back to the hotel, Louise, and wait there in case he\nreturns home another way. Beth and I will follow some of these paths and\nsee if we can find him.\"\n\n\"He may have sprained an ankle, and be unable to walk,\" suggested Beth.\n\"I think Patsy's advice is good.\"\n\nSo Louise returned through the town and the other girls began exploring\nthe paths that led into the mountains from every turn of the highway.\nBut although they searched eagerly and followed each path a mile or more\nof its length, no sign of life did they encounter--much less a sight of\ntheir missing uncle. The paths were wild and unfrequented, only on the\nCatania road itself a peasant now and then being found patiently\ntrudging along or driving before him a donkey laden with panniers of\noranges or lemons for the markets of Taormina.\n\nOn some of the solitary rocky paths they called to Uncle John by name,\nhoping that their voices might reach him; but only the echoes replied.\nFinally they grew discouraged.\n\n\"It will be sunset before we get back, even if we start this minute,\"\nsaid Beth, finally. \"Let us return, and get some one to help us.\"\n\nPatsy burst into tears.\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure he's lost, or murdered, or kidnapped!\" she wailed. \"Dear,\ndear Uncle John! Whatever shall we do, Beth?\"\n\n\"Why, he may be at home, waiting for us to get back. Don't give way,\nPatsy; it will do no good, you know.\"\n\nThey were thoroughly tired when, just at sunset, they reached the hotel.\nLouise came to meet them, and by the question in her eyes they knew\ntheir uncle had not returned.\n\n\"Something must be done, and at once,\" said Beth, decidedly. She was the\nyounger of the three girls, but in this emergency took the lead because\nof her calm and unruffled disposition and native good sense. \"Is\nFrascatti in the courtyard?\"\n\nPatsy ran to see, and soon brought the vetturino into their sitting\nroom. He could speak English and knew the neighborhood thoroughly. He\nought to be able to advise them.\n\nFrascatti listened intently to their story. He was very evidently\nimpressed.\n\n\"Tell me, then, signorini,\" he said, thoughtfully; \"is Senor Merreek\nvery rich?\"\n\n\"Why do you ask?\" returned Beth, suspiciously. She remembered the\nwarning conveyed in Mr. Watson's letter.\n\n\"Of course, I know that all the Americans who travel are rich,\"\ncontinued Frascatti. \"I have myself been in Chicago, which is America.\nBut is Signor Merreek a very rich and well acquainted man in his own\ncountry? Believe me, it is well that you answer truly.\"\n\n\"I think he is.\"\n\nThe man looked cautiously around, and then came nearer and dropped his\nvoice to a whisper.\n\n\"Are you aware that Il Duca knows this?\" he asked.\n\nBeth thought a moment.\n\n\"We met the man you call Il Duca, but who told us he was Signor Victor\nValdi, on board the ship, where many of the passengers knew my uncle\nwell. If he listened to their conversation he would soon know all about\nJohn Merrick, of course.\"\n\nFrascatti wagged his head solemnly.\n\n\"Then, signorina,\" he said, still speaking very softly, \"I assure you\nthere is no need to worry over your uncle's safety.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" demanded Beth.\n\n\"People do not lose their way in our mountains,\" he replied. \"The paths\nare straight, and lead all to the highways. And there is little danger\nof falling or of being injured. But--I regret to say it, signorini--it\nis a reflection upon our advanced civilization and the good name of our\npeople--but sometimes a man who is rich disappears for a time, and no\none knows how it is, or where he may be. He always returns; but then he\nis not so rich.\"\n\n\"I understand. My uncle is captured by brigands, you think.\"\n\n\"There are no brigands, signorina.\"\n\n\"Or the Mafia, then.\"\n\n\"I do not know the Mafia. All I know is that the very rich should keep\ntheir riches secret when they travel. In Chicago, which is America, they\nwill knock you upon the head for a few miserable dollars; here my\ncountrymen scorn to attack or to rob the common people. But when a man\nis so very rich that he does not need all of his money, there are, I\nregret to say, some lawless ones in Sicily who insist that he divide\nwith them. But the prisoner is always well treated, and when he pays he\nis sent away very happy.\"\n\n\"Suppose he does not pay?\"\n\n\"Ah, signorina, will not a drowning man clutch the raft that floats by?\nAnd the lawless ones do not take his all--merely a part.\"\n\nThe girls looked at one another helplessly.\n\n\"What must we do, Frascatti?\" asked Patsy.\n\n\"Wait. In a day--two days, perhaps--you will hear from your uncle. He\nwill tell you how to send money to the lawless ones. You will follow his\ninstructions, and he will come home with smiles and singing. I know. It\nis very regrettable, but it is so.\"\n\n\"It will not be so in this case,\" said Beth, indignantly. \"I will see\nthe American consul--\"\n\n\"I am sorry, but there is none here.\"\n\n\"I will telegraph to Messina for the military. They will search the\nmountains, and bring your brigands to justice.\"\n\nFrascatti smiled sadly.\n\n\"Oh, yes; perhaps they will come. But the military is Italian--not\nSicilian--and has no experience in these parts. The search will find\nnothing, except perhaps a dead body thrown upon the rocks to defy\njustice. It is very regrettable, signorina; but it is so.\"\n\nPatsy was wringing her hands, frantic with terror. Louise was white and\nstaring. Beth puckered her pretty brow in a frown and tried to think.\n\n\"Ferralti is also gone,\" murmured Louise, in a hoarse voice. \"They will\nrob or murder him with Uncle John!\"\n\n\"I am quite convinced,\" said Beth, coldly, \"that your false count is a\nfellow conspirator of the brigand called Il Duca. He has been following\nus around to get a chance to ensnare Uncle John.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no, Beth! It is not so! I know better than that.\"\n\n\"He would lie to you, of course,\" returned the girl bitterly. \"As soon\nas the trap was set he disappeared, bag and baggage, and left the simple\ngirl he had fooled to her own devices.\"\n\n\"You do not know what you are saying,\" retorted Louise, turning her back\nto Beth and walking to a window. From where they stood they could hear\nher sobbing miserably.\n\n\"Whether Frascatti is right or not,\" said Patsy, drying her eyes and\ntrying to be brave, \"we ought to search for Uncle John at once.\"\n\n\"I think so, too,\" agreed Beth. Then, turning to the Sicilian, she said:\n\"Will you get together as many men as possible and search the hills,\nwith lanterns, for my uncle? You shall be well paid for all you do.\"\n\n\"Most certainly, signorina, if it will please you,\" he replied. \"How\nlong do you wish us to search?\"\n\n\"Until you find him.\"\n\n\"Then must we grow old in your service. _Non fa niente!_ It is\nregrettable, but--\"\n\n\"Will you go at once?\" stamping her foot angrily.\n\n\"Most certainly, signorina.\"\n\n\"Then lose no time. I will go with you and see you start.\"\n\nShe followed the man out, and kept at his side until he had secured\nseveral servants with lanterns for the search. The promise of high\n_caparra_ or earnest money made all eager to join the band, but the\npadrone could only allow a half dozen to leave their stations at the\nhotel. In the town, however, whither Beth accompanied them, a score of\nsleepy looking fellows were speedily secured, and under the command of\nFrascatti, who had resolved to earn his money by energy and good will\nbecause there was no chance of success, they marched out of the Catania\nGate and scattered along the mountain paths.\n\n\"If you find Uncle John before morning I will give you a thousand lira\nadditional,\" promised Beth.\n\n\"We will search faithfully,\" replied her captain, \"but the signorina\nmust not be disappointed if the lawless ones evade us. They have a way\nof hiding close in the caves, where none may find them. It is\nregrettable, very; but it is so.\"\n\nThen he followed his men to the mountains, and as the last glimmer from\nhis lantern died away the girl sighed heavily and returned alone through\nthe deserted streets to the hotel.\n\nClouds hid the moon and the night was black and forbidding; but it did\nnot occur to her to be afraid.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nDAYS OF ANXIETY\n\n\nUncle John's nieces passed a miserable night. Patsy stole into his room\nand prayed fervently beside his bed that her dear uncle might be\npreserved and restored to them in health and safety. Beth, meantime,\npaced the room she shared with Patsy with knitted brows and flashing\neyes, the flush in her cheeks growing deeper as her anger increased. An\nungovernable temper was the girl's worst failing; the abductors of her\nuncle were arousing in her the most violent passions of which she was\ncapable, and might lead her to adopt desperate measures. She was only a\ncountry girl, and little experienced in life, yet Beth might be expected\nto undertake extraordinary things if, as she expressed it, if she \"got\ngood and mad!\"\n\nNo sound was heard during the night from the room occupied by Louise,\nbut the morning disclosed a white, drawn face and reddened eyelids as\nproof that she had rested as little as her cousins.\n\nYet, singularly enough, Louise was the most composed of the three when\nthey gathered in the little sitting room at daybreak, and tried\nearnestly to cheer the spirits of her cousins. Louise never conveyed the\nimpression of being especially sincere, but the pleasant words and\nmanners she habitually assumed rendered her an agreeable companion, and\nthis faculty of masking her real feelings now stood her in good stead\nand served to relieve the weight of anxiety that oppressed them all.\n\nFrascatti came limping back with his tired followers in the early dawn,\nand reported that no trace of the missing man had been observed. There\nwere no brigands and no Mafia; on that point all his fellow townsmen\nagreed with him fully. But it was barely possible some lawless ones who\nwere all unknown to the honest Taorminians had made the rich American a\nprisoner.\n\nIl Duca? Oh, no, signorini! A thousand times, no. Il Duca was queer and\nunsociable, but not lawless. He was of noble family and a native of the\ndistrict. It would be very wrong and foolish to question Il Duca's\nintegrity.\n\nWith this assertion Frascatti went to bed. He had not shirked the\nsearch, because he was paid for it, and he and his men had tramped the\nmountains faithfully all night, well knowing it would result in nothing\nbut earning their money.\n\nOn the morning train from Catania arrived Silas Watson and his young\nward Kenneth Forbes, the boy who had so unexpectedly inherited Aunt\nJane's fine estate of Elmhurst on her death. The discovery of a will\nwhich gave to Kenneth all the property their aunt had intended for her\nnieces had not caused the slightest estrangement between the young\nfolks, then or afterward. On the contrary, the girls were all glad that\nthe gloomy, neglected boy, with his artistic, high-strung temperament,\nwould be so well provided for. Without the inheritance he would have\nbeen an outcast; now he was able to travel with his guardian, the kindly\nold Elmhurst lawyer, and fit himself for his future important position\nin the world. More than all this, however, Kenneth had resolved to be a\ngreat landscape painter, and Italy and Sicily had done much, in the past\nyear, to prepare him for this career.\n\nThe boy greeted his old friends with eager delight, not noticing for the\nmoment their anxious faces and perturbed demeanor. But the lawyer's\nsharp eyes saw at once that something was wrong.\n\n\"Where is John Merrick?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, I'm so glad you've come!\" cried Patsy, clinging to his hand.\n\n\"We are in sore straits, indeed, Mr. Watson,\" said Louise.\n\n\"Uncle John is lost,\" explained Beth, \"and we're afraid he is in the\nhands of brigands.\"\n\nThen she related as calmly as she could all that had happened. The\nrelation was clear and concise. She told of their meeting with Valdi on\nthe ship, of Count Ferralti's persistence in attaching himself to their\nparty, and of Uncle John's discovery that the young man was posing under\nan assumed name. She did not fail to mention Ferralti's timely\nassistance on the Amalfi drive, or his subsequent devoted attentions to\nLouise; but the latter Beth considered merely as an excuse for following\nthem around.\n\n\"In my opinion,\" said she, \"we have been watched ever since we left\nAmerica, by these two spies, who had resolved to get Uncle John into\nsome unfrequented place and then rob him. If they succeed in their vile\nplot, Mr. Watson, we shall be humiliated and disgraced forever.\"\n\n\"Tut-tut,\" said he; \"don't think of that. Let us consider John Merrick,\nand nothing else.\"\n\nLouise protested that Beth had not been fair in her conclusions. The\nCount was an honorable man; she would vouch for his character herself.\n\nBut Mr. Watson did not heed this defense. The matter was very\nserious--how serious he alone realized--and his face was grave indeed as\nhe listened to the descriptions of that terrible Il Duca whom the\nnatives all shrank from and refused to discuss.\n\nWhen he had learned all the nieces had to tell he hastened into the town\nand telegraphed the American consul at Messina. Then he found the\nquestura, or police office, and was assured by the officer in attendance\nthat the disappearance of Mr. Merrick was already known to the\nauthorities and every effort was being made to find him.\n\n\"Do you think he has been abducted by brigands?\" asked the lawyer.\n\n\"Brigands, signore?\" was the astonished reply. \"There are no brigands in\nthis district at all. We drove them out many years ago.\"\n\n\"How about Il Duca?\"\n\n\"And who is that, signore?\"\n\n\"Don't you know?\"\n\n\"I assure you we have no official knowledge of such a person. There are\ndukes in Sicily, to be sure; but 'Il Duca' means nothing. Perhaps you\ncan tell me to whom you refer?\"\n\n\"See here,\" said the lawyer, brusquely; \"I know your methods, _questore\nmia_, but they won't prove effective in this case. If you think an\nAmerican is helpless in this country you are very much mistaken. But, to\nsave time, I am willing to submit to your official requirements. I will\npay you well for the rescue of my friend.\"\n\n\"All shall be done that is possible.\"\n\n\"But if you do not find him at once, and return him to us unharmed, I\nwill have a regiment of soldiers in Taormina to search your mountains\nand break up the bands of brigands that infest them. When I prove that\nbrigands are here and that you were not aware of them, you will be\ndisgraced and deposed from your office.\"\n\nThe official shrugged his shoulders, a gesture in which the Sicilian is\nas expert as the Frenchman.\n\n\"I will welcome the soldiery,\" said he; \"but you will be able to prove\nnothing. The offer of a reward may accomplish more--if it is great\nenough to be interesting.\"\n\n\"How great is that?\"\n\n\"Can I value your friend? You must name the reward yourself. But even\nthen I can promise nothing. In the course of our duty every effort is\nnow being made to find the missing American. But we work in the dark, as\nyou know. Your friend may be a suicide; he may have lost his mind and\nwandered into the wilderness; he may have committed some crime and\nabsconded. How do I know? You say he is missing, but that is no reason\nthe brigands have him, even did brigands exist, which I doubt. Rest\nassured, signore, that rigid search will be made. It is my boast that I\nleave no duty unfulfilled.\"\n\nMr. Watson walked back to the telegraph office and found an answer to\nhis message. The American consul was ill and had gone to Naples for\ntreatment. When he returned, his clerk stated, the matter of the\ndisappearance of John Merrick would immediately be investigated.\n\nFeeling extremely helpless and more fearful for his friend than before,\nthe lawyer returned to the hotel for a conference with the nieces.\n\n\"How much of a reward shall I offer?\" he asked. \"That seems to be the\nonly thing that can be depended upon to secure results.\"\n\n\"Give them a million--Uncle John won't mind,\" cried Patsy, earnestly.\n\n\"Don't give them a penny, sir,\" said Beth. \"If they are holding him for\na ransom Uncle is in no personal danger, and we have no right to assist\nin robbing him.\"\n\n\"But you don't understand, my dear,\" asserted the lawyer. \"These\nbrigands never let a victim go free unless they are well paid. That is\nwhy they are so often successful. If John Merrick is not ransomed he\nwill never again be heard of.\"\n\n\"But this is not a ransom, sir. You propose to offer a reward to the\npolice.\"\n\n\"Let me explain. The ways of the Italian police are very intricate. They\nknow of no brigandage here, and cannot find a brigand. But if the reward\nis great enough to divide, they know where to offer a share of it, in\nlieu of a ransom, and will force the brigands to accept it. In that way\nthe police gets the glory of a rescue and a share of the spoils. If we\noffer no reward, or an insignificant one, the brigands will be allowed\nto act as they please.\"\n\n\"That is outrageous!\" exclaimed Beth.\n\n\"Yes. The Italian government deplores it. It is trying hard to break up\na system that has existed for centuries, but has not yet succeeded.\"\n\n\"Then I'd prefer to deal directly with the brigands.\"\n\n\"So would I, if--\"\n\n\"If what, sir?\"\n\n\"If we were sure your uncle is in their hands. Do you think the party\nyou sent out last night searched thoroughly?\"\n\n\"I hope so.\"\n\n\"I will send out more men at once. They shall search the hills in every\ndirection. Should they find nothing our worst fears will be confirmed,\nand then--\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Watson?\"\n\n\"Then we must wait for the brigands to dictate the terms of a ransom,\nand make the best bargain we can.\"\n\n\"That seems sensible,\" said Kenneth, and both Patsy and Louise agreed\nwith him, although it would be tedious waiting.\n\nBut Beth only bit her lip and frowned.\n\nMr. Watson's searching party was maintained all day--for two days, and\nthree; but without result. Then they waited for the brigands to act.\nBut a week dragged painfully by and no word of John Merrick's\nwhereabouts reached the ears of the weary watchers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTATO\n\n\nWhen Uncle John passed through the west gate for a tramp along the\nmountain paths he was feeling in an especially happy and contented mood.\nThe day was bright and balmy, the air bracing, the scenery unfolded step\nby step magnificent and appealing. To be in this little corner of the\nold world, amid ruins antedating the Christian era, and able to wholly\nforget those awful stock and market reports of Wall street, was a\nprivilege the old gentleman greatly appreciated.\n\nSo away he trudged, exploring this path or that leading amongst the\nrugged cliffs, until finally he began to take note of his erratic\nwanderings and wonder where he was. Climbing an elevated rock near the\npath he poised himself upon its peak and studied the landscape spread\nout beneath him.\n\nThere was a patch of sea, with the dim Calabrian coast standing sentry\nbehind it. The nearer coast was hidden from view, but away at the left\nwas a dull white streak marking the old wall of Taormina, and above this\nthe ruined citadel and the ancient castle of Mola--each on its separate\npeak.\n\n\"I must be getting back,\" he thought, and sliding down the surface of\nthe rock he presently returned to the path from whence he had climbed.\n\nTo his surprise he found a boy standing there and looking at him with\nsoft brown eyes that were both beautiful and intelligent. Uncle John was\nas short as he was stout, but the boy scarcely reached to his shoulder.\nHe was slender and agile, and clothed in a grey corduroy suit that was\nbetter in texture than the American had seen other Sicilian youths wear.\nAs a rule the apparel of the children in this country seemed sadly\nneglected.\n\nYet the most attractive thing about this child was his face, which was\ndelicate of contour, richly tinted to harmonize with his magnificent\nbrown eyes, and so sensitive and expressive that it seemed able to\nconvey the most subtle shades of emotion. He seemed ten or twelve years\nof age, but might have been much older.\n\nAs soon as the American had returned to the path the boy came toward him\nin an eager, excited way, and exclaimed:\n\n\"Is it not Signor Merrick?\"\n\nThe English was fluent, and only rendered softer by the foreign\nintonation.\n\n\"It is,\" said Uncle John, cheerfully. \"Where did you drop from, my lad?\nI thought these hills were deserted, until now.\"\n\n\"I am sent by a friend,\" answered the boy, speaking rapidly and\nregarding the man with appealing glances. \"He is in much trouble,\nsignore, and asks your aid.\"\n\n\"A friend? Who is it?\"\n\n\"The name he gave me is Ferralti, signore. He is near to this place, in\nthe hills yonder, and unable to return to the town without assistance.\"\n\n\"Ferralti. H-m-m. Is he hurt?\"\n\n\"Badly, signore; from a fall on the rocks.\"\n\n\"And he sent for me?\"\n\n\"Yes, signore. I know you by sight--who does not?--and as I hurried\nalong I saw you standing on the rock. It is most fortunate. Will you\nhasten to your friend, then? I will lead you to him.\"\n\nUncle John hesitated. He ought to be getting home, instead of\npenetrating still farther into these rocky fastnesses. And Ferralti was\nno especial friend, to claim his assistance. But then the thought\noccurred that this young Italian had befriended both him and his nieces\nin an extremity, and was therefore entitled to consideration when\ntrouble in turn overtook himself. The natural impulse of this thought\nwas to go to his assistance.\n\n\"All right, my lad,\" said he. \"Lead on, and I'll see what can be done\nfor Ferralti. Is it far?\"\n\n\"Not far, signore.\"\n\nWith nervous, impatient steps the child started up the narrow path and\nUncle John followed--not slowly, but scarcely fast enough to satisfy his\nzealous guide.\n\n\"What is your name, little one?\"\n\n\"Tato, signore.\"\n\n\"Where do you live?\"\n\n\"Near by, signore.\"\n\n\"And how did you happen to find Ferralti?\"\n\n\"By chance, signore.\"\n\nUncle John saved his remaining breath for the climb. He could ask\nquestions afterward.\n\nThe path was in a crevasse where the rocks seemed once to have split. It\nwas narrow and steep, and before long ended in a _cul de sac_. The\nlittle man thought they had reached their destination, then; but without\nhesitation the boy climbed over a boulder and dropped into another path\non the opposite side, holding out a hand to assist the American.\n\nUncle John laughed at the necessity, but promptly slid his stout body\nover the boulder and then paused to mop his brow.\n\n\"Much farther, Tato?\"\n\n\"Just a step, signore.\"\n\n\"It is lucky you found Ferralti, or he might have died in these wilds\nwithout a soul knowing he was here.\"\n\n\"That is true, signore.\"\n\n\"Well, is this the path?\"\n\n\"Yes, signore. Follow me, please.\"\n\nThe cliffs were precipitous on both sides of them. It was another\ncrevasse, but not a long one. Presently the child came to a halt because\nthe way ended and they could proceed no farther. He leaned against the\nrock and in a high-pitched, sweet voice sang part of a Sicilian ditty,\nneither starting the verse nor ending it, but merely trilling out a\nfragment.\n\nUncle John regarded him wonderingly; and then, with a sudden suspicion,\nhe demanded:\n\n\"You are not playing me false, Tato?\"\n\n\"I, signore?\" smiling frankly into the man's eyes; \"you need never fear\nTato, signore. To be your friend, and Signor Ferralti's friend, makes me\nvery proud.\"\n\nThe rock he leaned against fell inward, noiselessly, and disclosed a\npassage. It was short, for there was light at the other end.\n\nThe strange child darted in at once.\n\n\"This way, signore. He is here!\"\n\nUncle John drew back. He had forgotten until now that these mountains\nare dangerous. And something strange in the present proceedings, the\nloneliness of the place and the elfish character of his guide, suddenly\nwarned him to be cautious.\n\n\"See here, my lad,\" he called: \"I'll go no farther.\"\n\nInstantly Tato was at his side again, grasping the man's hand in his\ntiny brown one and searching his face with pleading eyes.\n\n\"Ah, signore, you will not fail your friend, when he is so near you and\nin such great trouble? See! I who am a stranger and not even his\ncountryman, even I weep for the poor young man, and long to comfort him.\nDo you, his friend, refuse him aid because you have fear of the wild\nmountains and a poor peasant boy?\"\n\nTears really stood in the beautiful brown eyes. They rolled down his\ncheeks, as with both hands he pressed that of Uncle John and urged him\ngently forward.\n\n\"Oh, well; lead on, Tato. I'll see the other side of your tunnel,\nanyhow. But if you play me tricks, my lad--\"\n\nHe paused, for a wonderful vision had opened before him. Coming through\nthe short passage hewn in the rocks the American stood upon a ledge\nfacing a most beautiful valley, that was hemmed in by precipitous cliffs\non every side. From these stern barriers of the outside world the ground\nsloped gradually toward the center, where a pretty brook flowed, its\nwaters sparkling like diamonds in the sunlight as it tumbled over its\nrocky bed. Groves of oranges and of olive, lemon and almond trees\noccupied much of the vale, and on a higher point at the right, its back\nto the wall of rock that towered behind it, stood a substantial yet\npicturesque mansion of stone, with several outbuildings scattered on\neither side.\n\nThe valley seemed, indeed, a toy kingdom sequestered from the great\noutside world, yet so rich and productive within itself that it was\nindependent of all else.\n\nUncle John gazed with amazement. Who could have guessed this delightful\nspot was hidden safe within the heart of the bleak, bare mountain\nsurrounding it? But suddenly he bethought himself.\n\n\"What place is this, Tato?\" he asked; \"and where is our friend\nFerralti, who needs me?\"\n\nThere was no reply.\n\nHe turned around to find the boy had disappeared. Moreover, the passage\nhad disappeared. Only a wall of rock was behind him, and although his\neyes anxiously searched the rifts and cracks of its rough surface, no\nindication of the opening through which he had passed could be\ndiscovered.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nTHE HIDDEN VALLEY\n\n\nUncle John's first inspiration was to sit down upon a stone to think. He\ndrew out his pipe and lighted it, to assist his meditations.\n\nThese were none too pleasant. That he had been cleverly entrapped, and\nthat by a child scarcely in its teens, was too evident to need\nreflection. And what a secure trap it was! The mountains ranged all\naround the valley were impossible to scale, even by an Alpine climber,\nand to one who was not informed of its location the existence of the\nvalley itself was unimaginable.\n\n\"I had not believed Ferralti was so shrewd,\" he muttered, wonderingly.\n\"That something was wrong about the fellow I knew, of course; but I had\nnot suspected such a thing as this. Now, then, first of all let me mark\nthis spot, so that I will remember it. Just back of where I now stand is\nthe entrance or outlet to the tunnel through the wall. It is closed, I\nsuppose, by a swinging stone, like the one on the opposite side. I saw\nthat one opened--opened by some person concealed from view, as soon as\nthe boy sang his bit of song which was the signal agreed upon. And I was\nfool enough, after that warning, to walk straight through the tunnel!\nYou're getting old, John Merrick; that's the only way I can account for\nyour folly. But Ferralti hasn't won the odd trick yet, and if I keep my\nwits about me he isn't likely to win.\"\n\nThus ruminating, Uncle John searched the rocky wall carefully and\nbelieved he would know the place again, although which of the rough\nstones of its surface formed the doorway to the tunnel he could not\nguess.\n\nA ledge of rock served as a path leading to right and left around this\nend of the valley, or \"pocket\" in the mountain, as it could more\nproperly be called. Uncle John turned to the right, striding along with\nhis usual deliberation, smoking his pipe and swinging his cane as he\napproached the stone dwelling that formed the center of the little\nsettlement. As yet no sign of human life had he observed since Tato had\ndisappeared, although a few cows were standing in a green meadow and\nsome goats scrambled among the loose rocks at the further end of the\nenclosure.\n\nAround the house the grounds had been laid out in gardens, with flowers\nand shrubbery, hedges and shade trees scattered about. Chickens clucked\nand strutted along the paths and an air of restfulness and peace brooded\nover all.\n\nUncle John was plainly mystified until he drew quite close to the\ndwelling, which had many verandas and balconies and bore every evidence\nof habitation. Then, to his astonishment, he beheld the form of a man\nstretched lazily in a wicker chair beside the entrance, and while he\npaused, hesitating, the man sat up and bowed politely to him.\n\n\"Good morning, Signor Merreek.\"\n\nIt was Victor Valdi, or, ignoring the fictitious name, the mysterious\npersonage known as \"Il Duca.\"\n\n\"Behold my delight, Signor Merreek, to receive you in my poor home,\"\ncontinued the man. \"Will you not be seated, _caro amico_?\"\n\nThe words were soft and fair, but the dark eyes gleamed with triumph and\na sneer curled the thin lips.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Uncle John; \"I believe I will.\"\n\nHe stepped upon the veranda and sat down opposite his host.\n\n\"I came to see Count Ferralti, who is hurt, I understand,\" he continued.\n\n\"It is true, signore, but not badly. The poor count is injured mostly in\nhis mind. Presently you shall see him.\"\n\n\"No hurry,\" observed Uncle John. \"Pleasant place you have here, Duke.\"\n\n\"It is very good of you to praise it, signore. It is my most ancient\npatrimony, and quite retired and exclusive.\"\n\n\"So I see.\"\n\n\"The house you have honored by your presence, signore, was erected some\nthree hundred and thirty years ago, by an ancestor who loved\nretirement. It has been in my family ever since. We all love\nretirement.\"\n\n\"Very desirable spot for a brigand, I'm sure,\" remarked the American,\npuffing his pipe composedly.\n\n\"Brigand? Ah, it pleases you to have humor, signore, mia. Brigand! But I\nwill be frank. It is no dishonor to admit that my great ancestors of\npast centuries were truly brigands, and from this quiet haven sallied\nforth to do mighty deeds. They were quite famous, I am told, those olden\nDukes d'Alcanta.\"\n\n\"I do not question it.\"\n\n\"Our legends tell of how my great ancestors demanded tribute of the rich\nwho passed through their domain--for all this end of Sicily was given to\nus by Peter of Aragon, and remained in our possession until the second\nFerdinand robbed us of it. Those times were somewhat wild and barbarous,\nsignore, and a gentleman who protected his estates and asked tribute of\nstrangers was termed a brigand, and became highly respected. But now it\nis different. We are civilized and meek, and ruled most lovingly by\nItaly. They will tell you there is no brigandage in all Sicily.\"\n\n\"So I understand.\"\n\n\"To-day I am nobody. My very name is forgotten. Those around this\nmountain know nothing of my little estate, and I am content. I desire\nnot glory: I desire not prominence; to live my life in seclusion, with\nthe occasional visit of a friend like yourself, is enough to satisfy\nme.\"\n\n\"You seem well known in Taormina.\"\n\n\"Quite a mistake, signore.\"\n\n\"And the natives must have climbed these peaks at times and looked down\ninto your secluded kingdom.\"\n\n\"If so, they have forgotten it.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\n\"I give to the churches and the poor, but in secret. If I have an enemy,\nhe disappears--I do not know how; no one knows.\"\n\n\"Of course not. You are an improvement on your ancestors, Duke. Instead\nof being a brigand you belong to the Mafia, and perform your robberies\nand murders in security. Very clever, indeed.\"\n\n\"But again you are wrong, signore,\" replied the Duke, with a frown. \"I\nhave never known of this Mafia, of which you speak, nor do I believe it\nexists. For myself, I am no robber, but a peaceful merchant.\"\n\n\"A merchant?\" returned Uncle John, surprised by the statement.\n\n\"To be sure. I have some ancient and very valuable relics in my\npossession, treasured most carefully from the medi\u00c3\u00a6val days. These I\nsell to my friends--who are fortunately all foreigners like yourself and\ncan appreciate such treasures--and so obtain for myself and my family a\nmodest livelihood.\"\n\n\"And you expect to sell something to me?\" asked Uncle John,\nunderstanding very well the Sicilian's meaning.\n\n\"It is my earnest hope, signore.\"\n\nThe American fell silent, thinking upon the situation. The fierce\nlooking brigand beside him was absurd enough, in his way, but doubtless\na dangerous man to deal with. Uncle John was greatly interested in the\nadventure. It was such a sharp contrast to the hum-drum, unromantic\nAmerican life he had latterly known that he derived a certain enjoyment\nfrom the novel experience. If the girls did not worry over his absence\nhe would not much regret his visit to Il Duca's secluded valley.\n\nIt was already midday, and his nieces would be expecting him to\nluncheon. When he did not appear they would make enquiries, and try to\nfind him. It occurred to him how futile all such attempts must prove.\nEven to one acquainted with the mountain paths the entrance to the\nduke's domain was doubtless a secret, and the brigand had plainly hinted\nthat the native Sicilians were too cautious to spy upon him or molest\nhim in any way.\n\nSo far, the only person he had seen was Il Duca himself. The child who\nhad decoyed him was, of course, somewhere about, and so also was\nFerralti. How many servants or followers the brigand might have was as\nyet a mystery to the new arrival.\n\nIn the side pocket of Uncle John's loose coat lay a loaded revolver,\nwhich he had carried ever since he had received Mr. Watson's warning\nletter. He had never imagined a condition of danger where he could not\nuse this weapon to defend himself, and as long as it remained by him he\nhad feared nothing. But he had been made a prisoner in so deft a manner\nthat he had no opportunity to expostulate or offer any sort of\nresistance. Later there might be a chance to fight for his liberty, and\nthe only sensible action was to wait and bide his time.\n\n\"For example,\" the Duke was saying, in his labored, broken English, \"I\nhave here a priceless treasure--very antique, very beautiful. It was in\none time owned by Robert the Norman, who presented it to my greatest\nancestor.\"\n\nHe drew an odd-shaped ring from his pocket and handed it to the\nAmerican. It was of dull gold and set with a half dozen flat-cut\ngarnets. Perhaps antique; perhaps not; but of little intrinsic value.\n\n\"This ring I have decided to sell, and it shall be yours, Signor\nMerreek, at a price far less than is represented by its historic worth.\nI am sure you will be glad to buy it.\"\n\n\"For how much?\" asked Uncle John, curiously.\n\n\"A trifle; a mere hundred thousand lira.\"\n\n\"Twenty thousand dollars!\"\n\n\"The ring of King Roger. How cheap! But, nevertheless, you shall have it\nfor that sum.\"\n\nUncle John smiled.\n\n\"My dear Duke,\" he replied, \"you have made a sad mistake. I am a\ncomparatively poor man. My fortune is very modest.\"\n\nThe brigand lay back in his chair and lighted a fresh cigarette.\n\n\"I fear you undervalue yourself, my dear guest,\" he said. \"Recently have\nI returned from America, where I was told much of the wealth of Signor\nJohn Merreek, who is many times a millionaire. See,\" drawing a paper\nfrom his pocket, \"here is a list of the stocks and securities you own.\nAlso of government and railway bonds, of real estate and of manufactures\ncontrolled by your money. I will read, and you will correct me if an\nerror occurs.\"\n\nUncle John listened and was amazed. The schedule was complete, and its\ntotal was many millions. It was a better list of holdings than Uncle\nJohn possessed himself.\n\n\"You foreigners make queer mistakes, Duke,\" said he, taking another\ntack. \"This property belongs to another John Merrick. It is a common\nname, and that is doubtless why you mistook me for the rich John\nMerrick.\"\n\n\"I have noticed,\" returned the Duke, coldly, \"that this strange delusion\nof mind is apt to overtake my guests. But do not be alarmed; it will\npass away presently, and then you will realize that you are yourself.\nRemember that I crossed the Atlantic on your steamship, signore. Many\npeople there on board spoke of you and pointed you out to me as the\ngreat man of finance. Your own niece that is called Patsy, she also told\nme much about you, and of your kindness to her and the other young\nsignorini. Before I left New York a banker of much dignity informed me\nyou would sail on the ship 'Princess Irene.' If a mistake has been made,\nsignore, it is yours, and not mine. Is your memory clearer now?\"\n\nUncle John laughed frankly. The rascal was too clever for him to dispute\nwith.\n\n\"Whoever I am,\" said he, \"I will not buy your ring.\"\n\n\"I am pained,\" replied the brigand, lightly. \"But there is ample time\nfor you to reflect upon the matter. Do not decide hastily, I implore\nyou. I may have been too liberal in making my offer, and time may assist\nme in fixing a just price for the relic. But we have had enough of\nbusiness just now. It is time for our midday collation. Oblige me by\njoining us, signore.\"\n\nHe blew a shrill whistle, and a man stepped out of a doorway. He was an\nenormous Sicilian, tall, sinewy and with a countenance as dark and\nfierce as his master's. In his belt was a long knife, such as is known\nas a stilleto.\n\n\"Tommaso,\" said the Duke, \"kindly show Signor Merreek to his room, and\nask Guido if luncheon is ready to be served.\"\n\n\"_Va bene, padrone_,\" growled the man, and turned obediently to escort\nthe American.\n\nUncle John entered the house, traversed a broad and cool passage,\nmounted to the second floor and found himself in a pleasant room with a\nbalcony overlooking the valley. It was comfortably furnished, and with\na bow that was not without a certain grim respect the man left him alone\nand tramped down the stairs again. There had been no attempt to restrain\nhis liberty or molest him in any way, yet he was not slow to recognize\nthe fact that he was a prisoner. Not in the house, perhaps, but in the\nvalley. There was no need to confine him more closely. He could not\nescape.\n\nHe bathed his hands and face, dried them on a fresh towel, and found his\ntoilet table well supplied with conveniences. In the next room some one\nwas pacing the floor like a caged beast, growling and muttering angrily\nat every step.\n\nUncle John listened. \"The brigand seems to have more than one guest,\" he\nthought, and smiled at the other's foolish outbursts.\n\nThen he caught a word or two of English that made him start. He went to\nthe door between the two rooms and threw it open, finding himself face\nto face with Count Ferralti.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nGUESTS OF THE BRIGAND\n\n\n\"Good morning, Count,\" said Uncle John, cheerfully.\n\nThe other stared at him astonished.\n\n\"Good heavens! Have they got you, too?\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Why, I'm visiting his excellency, Il Duca, if that's what you mean,\"\nreplied Mr. Merrick. \"But whether he's got me, or I've got him, I\nhaven't yet decided.\"\n\nThe young man's jaw was tied in a bandage and one of his eyes was black\nand discolored. He looked agitated and miserable.\n\n\"Sir, you are in grave danger; we are both in grave danger,\" he\nannounced, \"unless we choose to submit to being robbed by this rascally\nbrigand.\"\n\n\"Then,\" observed Uncle John, \"let's submit.\"\n\n\"Never! Not in a thousand years!\" cried Ferralti, wildly. And then this\nsingular young man sank into a chair and burst into tears.\n\nUncle John was puzzled. The slender youth--for he was but a youth in\nspite of his thin moustaches--exhibited a queer combination of courage\nand weakness; but somehow Uncle John liked him better at that moment\nthan he ever had before. Perhaps because he now realized he had unjustly\nsuspected him.\n\n\"You seem to have been hurt, Count,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Why, I was foolish enough to struggle, and that brute Tommaso pounded\nme,\" was the reply. \"You were wise to offer no resistance, sir.\"\n\n\"As for that, I hadn't a choice,\" said Uncle John, smiling. \"When did\nthey get you, Ferralti?\"\n\n\"Last evening. I walked in the garden of the hotel and they threw a sack\nover my head. I resisted and tried to cry out. They beat me until I was\ninsensible and then brought me here, together with my travelling cases,\nwhich they removed from my room to convey the impression that I had gone\naway voluntarily. When I awakened from my swoon I was in this room,\nwith the doctor bending over me.\"\n\n\"The doctor?\"\n\n\"Oh, they have a doctor in this accursed den, as well as a priest and a\nlawyer. The Duke entreated my pardon. He will punish his men for abusing\nme. But he holds me a safe prisoner, just the same.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"He wants a ransom. He will force me to purchase an ancient brass\ncandlestick for fifty thousand lira.\"\n\nUncle John looked at his companion thoughtfully.\n\n\"Tell me, Count Ferralti,\" he said, \"who you really are. I had believed\nyou were Il Duca's accomplice, until now. But if he has trapped you, and\ndemands a ransom, it is because you are a person of some consequence,\nand able to pay. May I not know as much about your position in life as\ndoes this brigand duke?\"\n\nThe young man hesitated. Then he spread out his hands with an appealing\ngesture and said:\n\n\"Not yet, Mr. Merrick! Do not press me now, I implore you. Perhaps I\nhave done wrong to try to deceive you, but in good time I will explain\neverything, and then you will understand me better.\"\n\n\"You are no count.\"\n\n\"That is true, Mr. Merrick.\"\n\n\"You are not even an Italian.\"\n\n\"That is but partly true, sir.\"\n\n\"You have seen fit to deceive us by--\"\n\nTommaso threw wide the door.\n\n\"_Il dejun\u00c3\u00a9 \u00c3\u00a9 servito_,\" he said gruffly.\n\n\"What does that mean?\" asked Uncle John.\n\n\"Luncheon is ready. Shall we go down?\"\n\n\"Yes; I'm hungry.\"\n\nThey followed the man to the lower floor, where he ushered them into a\nlow, cool room where a long table was set. The walls were whitewashed\nand bore some religious prints, gaudily colored. A white cloth covered\nthe table, which was well furnished with modern crockery and glass, and\nantique silverware.\n\nAt the head of the table were two throne-like chairs, one slightly\nlarger and more elevated than the other. In the more important seat was\na withered old woman with a face like that of a mummy, except that it\nwas supplied with two small but piercing jet eyes that seemed very much\nalive as they turned shrewdly upon the strangers. She was the only one\nof the company they found seated. The Duke stood behind the smaller\nchair beside her, and motioned the Americans to occupy two places at the\nside of the table next him. Opposite them, in the places adjoining the\nelevated dais, were two remarkable individuals whom Uncle John saw for\nthe first time. One was a Cappuccin monk, with shaven crown and coarse\ncassock fastened at the waist by a cord. He was blind in one eye and the\nlid of the other drooped so as to expose only a thin slit. Fat, awkward\nand unkempt, he stood holding to the back of his chair and swaying\nslightly from side to side. Next to him was a dandified appearing man\nwho was very slight and thin of form but affected the dress and manners\nof extreme youth. Ferralti whispered to Uncle John that this was the\ndoctor.\n\nThe table dropped a step in heighth from these places, and the balance\nof its length was occupied by several stalwart Sicilians, clothed in\nordinary peasant costume, and a few silent, heavy-featured women. Tato\nwas not present.\n\n\"Signori,\" said the Duke to the Americans, \"allow me to present you to\nmy mother, the head of our illustrious family; one who is known, admired\nand feared throughout Sicily as her Excellenza la Duchessa d'Alcanta.\"\n\nWith the words the Duke bowed low to the old woman. Uncle John and\nFerralti also bowed low. The lines of servitors humbly bent themselves\ndouble. But the Duchessa made no acknowledgment. Her bead like eyes\nsearched the faces of the \"guests\" with disconcerting boldness, and then\ndropped to her plate.\n\nAt this signal the fat priest mumbled a blessing upon the food, the Duke\nwaved his hand, and all the company became seated.\n\nUncle John felt as if he were taking part in a comic opera, and enjoyed\nthe scene immensely. But now his attention was distracted by the\nstewards bringing in steaming platters of macaroni and stewed mutton,\nfrom which they first served the Duchessa, and then the Duke, and\nafterward the guests. The servants waited hungry-eyed until these\nformalities were completed, and then swept the platters clean and ate\nravenously.\n\nUncle John plied his knife and fork busily and found the food\nexcellently prepared. Ferralti seemed to have little appetite. Some of\nhis teeth had been knocked out and his broken wrist, which had but\npartially healed, had been wrenched in the scrimmage of the night before\nso that it caused him considerable pain.\n\nThe Duke attempted little conversation, doubtless through deference to\nthe aged Duchessa, who remained absolutely silent and unresponsive to\nher surroundings. He praised his wine, however, which he said was from\ntheir own vineyards, and pressed the Americans to drink freely.\n\nWhen she had finished her meal the Duchessa raised a hand, and at the\nsignal the whole company arose and stood at their places while two of\nthe women assisted her to retire. She leaned upon their shoulders, being\ntaller than her son, but displayed surprising vigor for one so advanced\nin years.\n\nWhen she had gone the others finished at their leisure, and the\nconversation became general, the servants babbling in their voluble\nItalian without any restraint whatever.\n\nThen the Duke led his prisoners to the veranda and offered them cigars.\nThese were brought by Tato, who then sat in the duke's lap and curled up\naffectionately in his embrace, while the brigand's expression softened\nand he stroked the boy's head with a tender motion.\n\nUncle John watched the little scene approvingly. It was the first time\nhe had seen Tato since the child had lured him through the tunnel.\n\n\"Your son, Duke?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, signore; my only child. The heir to my modest estate.\"\n\n\"And a very good brigand, already, for his years,\" added Mr. Merrick.\n\"Ah, Tato, Tato,\" shaking his head at the child, \"how could you be so\ncruel as to fool an innocent old chap like me?\"\n\nTato laughed.\n\n\"I did not deceive you, signore. You but misunderstood me. I said\nSignor Ferralti was hurt, and so he was.\"\n\n\"But you said he needed my assistance.\"\n\n\"Does he not, signore?\"\n\n\"How do you speak such good English?\"\n\n\"Father Antoine taught me.\"\n\n\"The monk?\"\n\n\"Yes, signore.\"\n\n\"My child is a linguist,\" remarked the Duke, complacently. \"Sh--he has\nbeen taught English, German and French, even from the days of infancy.\nIt is very good for me, for now Tato can entertain my guests.\"\n\n\"Have you no Italian guests, then?\" asked Uncle John.\n\n\"No, since Italy owns Sicily, and I am a loyal subject. Neither have I\nmany Germans or Frenchmen, although a few wander my way, now and then.\nBut the Americans I love, and often they visit me. There were three last\nyear, and now here are two more to honor me with their presence.\"\n\n\"The Americans make easier victims, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Oh, the Americans are very rich, and they purchase my wares liberally.\nBy the way, Signor Ferralti,\" turning to the young man, \"have you\ndecided yet the little matter of your own purchase?\"\n\n\"I will not buy your candlestick, if that is what you refer to,\" was the\nresponse.\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"By no means. Fifty thousand lira, for a miserable bit of brass!\"\n\n\"But I forgot to tell you, signore; the candlestick is no longer for\nsale,\" observed the Duke, with an evil smile. \"Instead, I offer you a\nmagnificent bracelet which is a hundred years old.\"\n\n\"Thank you. What's the price?\"\n\n\"A hundred thousand lira, signore.\"\n\nFerralti started. Then in turn he smiled at his captor.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" said he. \"I have no wealth at all, sir, but live on a\nsmall allowance that barely supplies my needs. I cannot pay.\"\n\n\"I will take that risk, signore,\" said the brigand, coolly. \"You have\nbut to draw me an order on Mr. Edward Leighton, of New York, for one\nhundred thousand lira--or say twenty thousand dollars--and the bracelet\nis yours.\"\n\n\"Edward Leighton! My father's attorney! How did you know of him, sir?\"\n\n\"I have an agent in New York,\" answered the Duke, \"and lately I have\nbeen in your city myself.\"\n\n\"Then, if you know so much, you scoundrelly thief, you know that my\nfather will not honor a draft for such a sum as you demand. I doubt if\nmy father would pay a single dollar to save me from assassination.\"\n\n\"We will not discuss that, signore, for I regret to say that your father\nis no longer able to honor drafts. However, your attorney can do so, and\nwill, without question.\"\n\nFerralti stared at him blankly.\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" he demanded.\n\nThe Duke shook the ashes from his cigar and examined the glowing end\nwith interest.\n\n\"Your father,\" was the deliberate reply, \"was killed in a railway\naccident, four days ago. I have just been notified of the fact by a\ncable from America.\"\n\nFerralti sat trembling and regarding the man with silent horror.\n\n\"Is this true, sir?\" asked Uncle John, quickly; \"or is it only a part of\nyour cursed game?\"\n\n\"It is quite true, signore, I regret being obliged to break the ill news\nso abruptly; but this gentleman thought himself too poor to purchase my\nlittle bracelet, and it was necessary to inform him that he is suddenly\nmade wealthy--not yet so great a Croesus as yourself, Signor Merreek,\nbut still a very rich man.\"\n\nFerralti ceased trembling, but the horror still clung to his eyes.\n\n\"A railway wreck!\" he muttered, hoarsely. \"Where was it, sir? Tell me, I\nbeseech you! And are you sure my father is dead?\"\n\n\"Very sure, signore. My informant is absolutely reliable. But the\ndetails of the wreck I do not know. I am only informed of the fact of\nyour father's death, and that his will leaves you his entire fortune.\"\n\nFerralti arose and staggered away to his room, and Uncle John watched\nhim go pityingly, but knew no way to comfort him. When he had gone he\nasked gently:\n\n\"His father was an American, Duke?\"\n\n\"Yes, signore.\"\n\n\"And wealthy, you say?\"\n\n\"Exceedingly wealthy, signore.\"\n\n\"What was his name?\"\n\n\"Ah; about that ring, my dear guest. Do you think a hundred and fifty\nthousand lira too much for it?\"\n\n\"You said a hundred thousand.\"\n\n\"That was this morning, signore. The ring has increased in value since.\nTo-morrow, without doubt, it will be worth two hundred thousand.\"\n\nTato laughed at the rueful expression on the victim's face, and, a\nmoment after, Uncle John joined in his laughter.\n\n\"Very good, duke,\" he said. \"I don't wish to rob you. Let us wait until\nto-morrow.\"\n\nThe brigand seemed puzzled.\n\n\"May I ask why, Signor Merreek--since you are warned?\" he enquired.\n\n\"Why, it's this way, Duke. I'm just a simple, common-place American,\nand have lived a rather stupid existence for some time. We have no\nbrigands at home, nor any hidden valleys or protected criminals like\nyourself. The romance of my surroundings interests me; your methods are\nunique and worth studying; if I am so rich as you think me a few extra\nhundred thousand lira will be a cheap price to pay for this experience.\nIs it not so?\"\n\nThe Duke frowned.\n\n\"Do you play with me?\" he asked, menacingly.\n\n\"By no means. I'm just the spectator. I expect you to make the\nentertainment. I'm sure it will be a good show, although the price is\nrather high.\"\n\nIl Duca glared, but made no reply at the moment. Instead, he sat\nstroking Tato's hair and glowering evilly at the American.\n\nThe child whispered something in Italian, and the man nodded.\n\n\"Very well, signore,\" he said, more quietly. \"To-morrow, then, if it so\npleases you.\"\n\nThen, taking Tato's hand, he slowly arose and left the veranda.\n\nFor a moment the American looked after them with a puzzled expression.\nThen he said to himself, with a smile: \"Ah, I have solved one mystery,\nat any rate. Tato is a girl!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nA DIFFICULT POSITION\n\n\nAnd now Uncle John, finding himself left alone, took his walkingstick\nand started out to explore the valley.\n\nHe felt very sorry for young Ferralti, but believed his sympathy could\nin no way lighten the blow caused by the abrupt news of his parent's\ndeath. He would wish to be alone with his grief for a time. By and by\nMr. Merrick intended to question his fellow prisoner and try to find out\nsomething of his history.\n\nThe dale was very beautiful as it lay basking in the afternoon sun. Near\nthe house was a large vegetable garden, which, being now shaded by the\noverhanging cliffs, was being tended by a sour-visaged Sicilian. Uncle\nJohn watched him for a time, but the fellow paid no heed to him. Every\nservant connected with the duke's establishment seemed surly and morose,\nand this was the more remarkable because the country folk and villagers\nUncle John had met were usually merry and light-hearted.\n\nDown by the brook were green meadows and groves of fruit trees. The\nlittle gentleman followed the stream for some distance, and finally came\nupon a man seated on the bank above a broad pool, intently engaged in\nfishing. It proved to be the dandified old doctor, who wore gloves to\nprotect his hands and a broad-rimmed straw hat to shade his face.\n\nUncle John stood beside the motionless figure for a moment, watching the\nline. Then, forgetting he was in a foreign country, he asked carelessly:\n\n\"Any luck?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" was the quiet reply, in clear English. \"It is too early to\ninterest the fishes. An hour later they will bite.\"\n\n\"Then why did you come so soon?\"\n\n\"To escape that hell-hole yonder,\" nodding his head toward the house.\n\nUncle John was surprised.\n\n\"But you are not a prisoner, doctor,\" he ventured to say.\n\n\"Except through the necessity of earning a livelihood. Il Duca pays\nwell--or rather the Duchessa does, for she is the head of this\nhousehold. I am skillful, and worth my price, and they know it.\"\n\n\"You say the Duchessa is the head of the house?\"\n\n\"Assuredly, signore. Il Duca is her slave. She plans and directs\neverything, and her son but obeys her will.\"\n\n\"Did she send him to America?\"\n\n\"I think so. But do not misunderstand me. The Duke is clever on his own\naccount, and almost as wicked as his old mother. And between them they\nare training the child to be as bad as they are. It is dreadful.\"\n\n\"Have you been here long?\"\n\n\"For seven years, signore.\"\n\n\"But you can resign whenever you please?\"\n\n\"Why not? But the doubt makes me uneasy, sometimes. In another year I\nwould like to go to Venice, and retire from professional life. I am a\nVenetian, you observe; no dastardly brigand of a Sicilian. And in\nanother year I shall have sufficient means to retire and end my days in\npeace. Here I save every centessimo I make, for I can spend nothing.\"\n\nUncle John sat down upon the bank beside the confiding Venetian.\n\n\"Doctor,\" said he, \"I am somewhat puzzled by this man you call Il Duca,\nas well as by my audacious capture and the methods employed to rob me.\nI'd like your advice. What shall I do?\"\n\n\"The only possible thing, signore. Submit.\"\n\n\"Why is it the only possible thing?\"\n\n\"Have you not yet discovered? Unless you pay, your friends will never\nhear from you again. Il Duca, by his mother's favor, is king here. He\nwill murder you if you oppose his demands.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"It is quite certain, signore. He has murdered several obstinate people\nsince I have been here, and the outside world will never know their\nfate. It is folly to oppose the king. Were you not rich you would not be\nhere. Il Duca knows the exact wealth of every American who travels\nabroad and is likely to visit Sicily. Many escape him, but a few wander\ninto his toils, for he is wonderfully sagacious. Mark you: he does not\ndemand your all; he merely takes tribute, leaving his victims sufficient\nto render life desirable to them. If he required their all, many would\nas soon forfeit life as make the payment; but a tithe they will spare\nfor the privilege of living. That is why he is so successful. And that\nis why he remains undisturbed. For an American, being robbed so simply,\nnever tells of his humiliating experience. He goes home, and avoids\nSicily ever after.\"\n\n\"H-m-m. I understand.\"\n\n\"But if you do not pay, you are not permitted to leave this place. You\nare killed at once, and the incident is over. Il Duca does not love to\nmurder, but he takes no chances.\"\n\n\"I see. But suppose I pay, and then make complaint to the Italian\ngovernment?\"\n\n\"It has been done, signore. But the government is very blind. It does\nnot know Il Duca d' Alcanta. Its officials are convinced he does not\nexist. They investigate carefully, and declare the tale is all a myth.\"\n\n\"Then there is no way of escape?\"\n\n\"Absolutely none. Such a condition is almost inconceivable, is it not?\nand in this enlightened age? But it exists, and is only harmful when its\nvictims are stubborn and rebellious. To be cheerful and pay promptly is\nthe only sensible way out of your difficulty.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Uncle John. \"I shall probably pay promptly. But tell\nme, to satisfy my curiosity, how does your duke murder his victims?\"\n\n\"He does not call it murder, as I do; he says they are suicides, or the\nvictims of accident. They walk along a path and fall into a pit. It is\ndeep, and they are killed. The pit is also their tomb. They are\nforgotten, and the trap is already set for their successors.\"\n\n\"Rather a gloomy picture, doctor.\"\n\n\"Yes. I tell you this because my nature is kind. I abhor all crime, and\nmuch prefer that you should live. But, if you die, my _salario_\ncontinues. I am employed to guard the health of the Duke's\nfamily--especially the old Duchessa--and have no part in this detestable\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"Isn't that a bite?\"\n\n\"No, signore. It is the current. It is not time for the fish to bite.\"\n\nUncle John arose.\n\n\"Good afternoon, doctor.\"\n\n\"Good afternoon, signore.\"\n\nHe left the old fellow sitting there and walked on. The valley was about\na half mile long and from a quarter to a third of a mile in width. It\nresembled a huge amphitheatre in shape.\n\nThe American tramped the length of the brook, which disappeared into the\nrocky wall at the far end. Then he returned through the orchards to the\nhouse.\n\nThe place was silent and seemed deserted. There was a languor in the\natmosphere that invited sleep. Uncle John sought his room and lay down\nfor an afternoon nap, soon falling into a sound slumber.\n\nWhen he awoke he found Ferralti seated beside his bed. The young man was\npale, but composed.\n\n\"Mr. Merrick,\" said he, \"what have you decided to do?\"\n\nUncle John rubbed his eyes and sat up.\n\n\"I'm going to purchase that ring,\" he answered, \"at the best price the\nDuke will make me.\"\n\n\"I am disappointed,\" returned Ferralti, stiffly. \"I do not intend to\nallow myself to be robbed in this way.\"\n\n\"Then write a farewell letter, and I'll take it to your friends.\"\n\n\"It may not be necessary, sir.\"\n\nUncle John regarded him thoughtfully.\n\n\"What can you do?\" he asked.\n\nFerralti leaned forward and whispered, softly: \"I have a stout\npocket-knife, with a very long blade. I shall try to kill the Duke. Once\nhe is dead his people will not dare to oppose us, but will fly in\nterror. It is only Il Duca's audacity and genius that enables this\nrobber's den to exist.\"\n\n\"You would rather attempt this than pay?\"\n\n\"Sir, I could not bear the infamy of letting this scoundrel triumph over\nme.\"\n\n\"Well, Ferralti, you are attempting a delicate and dangerous task, but\nso far as I can, I will help you.\"\n\nHe took the revolver from his pocket and handed it to his companion.\n\n\"It's loaded in every chamber,\" he whispered. \"Perhaps it will serve\nyour purpose better than a knife.\"\n\nFerralti's eyes sparkled.\n\n\"Good!\" he exclaimed, concealing the weapon. \"I shall watch for my\nopportunity, so as to make no mistake. Meantime, do you bargain with the\nDuke, but postpone any agreement to pay.\"\n\n\"All right, my lad. I'll wait to see what happens. It may add a good\ndeal to the cost of that ring, if you fail; but I'll take the chances of\nthat for the sake of the game.\"\n\nHe paused a moment, and then added:\n\n\"Is your father really dead, Count?\"\n\n\"Yes; the Duke has sent me the cablegram he received from his agent. I\ncannot doubt his authority. My father and I have not been friendly, of\nlate years. He was a severe man, cold and unsympathetic, but I am sorry\nwe could not have been reconciled before this awful fate overtook him.\nHowever, it is now too late for vain regrets. I tried not to disobey or\nantagonize my one parent, but he did not understand my nature, and\nperhaps I failed to understand his.\"\n\nHe sighed, and rising from his chair walked to the window to conceal his\nemotion.\n\nUncle John remained silent, and presently Tommaso entered to notify them\nthat dinner would be served in a half hour, and the Duke expected them\nto join him at the table.\n\nThe next morning Mr. Merrick bargained pleasantly with his jailer, who\nseemed not averse to discussing the matter at length; but no conclusion\nwas reached. Ferralti took no part in the conversation, but remained\nsullen and silent, and the Duke did not press him.\n\nThe day after, however, he insisted that he had dallied long enough,\nalthough after much argument on the part of his enforced guests he\nagreed to give them three days to decide, with the understanding that\neach day they delayed would add a goodly sum to their ransom. If at the\nend of the three days the Americans remained obdurate, he would invite\nthem to take a little walk, and the affair would be terminated.\n\nFerralti hugged his revolver and awaited his opportunity. It seemed to\nUncle John that he might have had a hundred chances to shoot the\nbrigand, who merited no better fate than assassination at their hands;\nbut although Ferralti was resolved upon the deed he constantly hesitated\nto accomplish it in cold blood, and the fact that he had three days\ngrace induced him to put off the matter as long as possible.\n\nHe came to regret most bitterly his indecision; for something in the\nyoung man's eyes must have put the brigand on his guard. When they awoke\non the third morning, which was the fifth since their imprisonment, some\none had searched their rooms thoroughly. The revolver and the knife were\nboth gone, and the loss rendered them absolutely helpless.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nUNCLE JOHN PLAYS EAVESDROPPER\n\n\nIt now seemed to Uncle John that further resistance to the demands of Il\nDuca was as useless as it was dangerous. He resented the necessity of\npaying a ransom as much as any man could; but imprisoned as he was in a\nveritable \"robbers' den,\" without means of communicating with the\nauthorities or the outside world, and powerless to protect his life from\nthe vengeance of the unprincipled scoundrel who held him, the only safe\nand sane mode of procedure was to give in as gracefully as possible.\n\nHe formed this conclusion during a long walk around the valley, during\nwhich he once more noted the absolute seclusion of the place and the\nimpossibility of escape by scaling the cliffs. The doctor was fishing\nagain by the brook, but paid no heed when Uncle John tramped by. The\nsight of the dapper little man gave Mr. Merrick a thought, and\npresently he turned back and sat down beside the fisherman.\n\n\"I want to get out of this,\" he said, bluntly. \"It was fun, at first,\nand rather interesting; but I've had enough of it.\"\n\nThe physician kept his eye on the line and made no reply.\n\n\"I want you to tell me how to escape,\" continued Uncle John. \"It's no\nuse saying that it can't be done, for nothing is impossible to a clever\nman, such as I believe you to be.\"\n\nStill no reply.\n\n\"You spoke, the other day, of earning enough money to go home and live\nin peace for the rest of your days. Here, sir, is your opportunity to\nimprove upon that ambition. The brigand is trying to exact a large\nransom from me; I'll give it to you willingly--every penny--if you'll\nshow me how to escape.\"\n\n\"Why should you do that?\" enquired the doctor, still intent upon his\nline. \"Does it matter to you who gets your money?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" was the prompt reply. \"In one case I pay it for a service\nrendered, and do it gladly. On the other hand, I am robbed, and that\ngoes against the grain. Il Duca has finally decided to demand fifty\nthousand dollars. It shall be yours, instead, if you give me your\nassistance.\"\n\n\"Signore,\" said the other, calmly, \"I would like this money, and I\nregret that it is impossible for me to earn it. But there is no means of\nescape from this place except by the passage through the rocks, which\npassage only three people know the secret of opening--Il Duca himself,\nthe child Tato, and the old Duchessa. Perhaps Tommaso also knows; I am\nnot certain; but he will not admit he has such knowledge. You see,\nsignore, I am as much a prisoner as yourself.\"\n\n\"There ought to be some way to climb these cliffs; some secret path or\nunderground tunnel,\" remarked Uncle John, musingly.\n\n\"It is more than a hundred years since this valley was made secure by a\nbrigand ancestor of our Duchessa,\" was the reply. \"It may be two or\nthree centuries ago, for all I know. And ever since it has been used for\njust this purpose: to hold a prisoner until he was ransomed--and no\nsuch man has ever left the place alive unless he paid the price.\"\n\n\"Then you cannot help me?\" asked Uncle John, who was weary of hearing\nthese pessimistic declarations.\n\n\"I cannot even help myself; for I may not resign my position here unless\nthe Duke is willing I should go.\"\n\n\"Good morning, doctor.\"\n\nThe prisoner returned slowly toward the dwelling, with its group of\nouthouses. By chance he found a path leading to the rear of these which\nhe had not traversed before, and followed it until he came to a hedge of\nthickly set trees of some variety of cactus, which seemed to have been\nplanted to form an enclosure. Cautiously pushing aside the branches\nbordering a small gap in this hedge, Uncle John discovered a charming\ngarden lying beyond, so he quickly squeezed himself through the opening\nand entered.\n\nThe garden was rudely but not badly kept. There was even some attempt at\nornamentation, and many of the shrubs and flowers were rare and\nbeautiful. Narrow walks traversed the masses of foliage, and several\nleafy bowers invited one to escape the heat of the midday sun in their\nshelter. It was not a large place, and struck one as being overcrowded\nbecause so many of the plants were taller than a man's head.\n\nUncle John turned down one path which, after several curves and turns,\ncame to an abrupt ending beneath the spreading branches of an acacia\ntree which had been converted into a bower by a thick, climbing vine,\nwhose matted leaves and purple blossoms effectually screened off the\ngarden beyond.\n\nWhile he stood gazing around him to find a way out without retracing his\nsteps, a clear voice within a few feet of him caused him to start. The\nvoice spoke in vehement Italian, and came from the other side of the\nscreen of vines. It was sharp and garrulous in tone, and although Uncle\nJohn did not understand the words he recognized their dominating accent.\n\nThe Duke replied, slowly and sullenly, and whatever he said had the\neffect of rousing the first speaker to fierce anger.\n\nThe American became curious. He found a place where the leaves were\nthinner than elsewhere, and carefully pressing them apart looked through\nthe opening. Beyond was a clear space, well shaded and furnished with\ncomfortable settles, tables and chairs. It adjoined a wing of the\ndwelling, which stood but a few paces away and was evidently occupied by\nthe women of the household. The old Duchessa, her face still like a\ndeath mask but her eyes glittering with the brightness of a serpent's,\nsat enthroned within a large chair in the center of a family group. It\nwas her sharp voice that had first aroused the American's attention.\nOpposite her sat the Duke, his thin face wearing an expression of gloom\nand dissatisfaction. The child Tato occupied a stool at her father's\nfeet, and in the background were three serving women, sewing or\nembroidering. Near the Duke stood the tall brigand known as Pietro.\n\nAnswering the old woman's fierce tirade, Tato said:\n\n\"It is foolish to quarrel in Italian. The servants are listening.\"\n\n\"Let us then speak in English,\" returned the Duchessa. \"These are\nmatters the servants should not gossip about.\"\n\nThe Duke nodded assent. Both Tato and her grandmother spoke easily the\nforeign tongue; the Duke was more uncertain in his English, but\nunderstood it perfectly.\n\n\"I am still the head of this family,\" resumed the Duchessa, in a more\nmoderate tone. \"I insist that my will be obeyed.\"\n\n\"Your dignity I have the respect for,\" replied the Duke, laboredly; \"but\nyou grow old and foolish.\"\n\n\"Foolish! I?\"\n\n\"Yes; you are absurd. You live in past centuries. You think to-day we\nmust do all that your ancestors did.\"\n\n\"Can you do better?\"\n\n\"Yes; the world has change. It has progress. With it I advance, but you\ndo not. You would murder, rob, torture to-day as the great Duke, your\ngrandfather, did. You think we still are of the world independent. You\nthink we are powerful and great. Bah! we are nothing--we are as a speck\nof dust. But still we are the outlaws and the outcasts of Sicily, and\nsome day Italy will crush us and we will be forgotten.\"\n\n\"I dare them to molest us!\"\n\n\"Because you are imbecile. The world you do not know. I have travel; I\nsee many countries; and I am wise.\"\n\n\"But you are still my vassal, my slave; and I alone rule here. Always\nhave you rebelled and wanted to escape. Only my iron will has kept you\nhere and made you do your duty.\"\n\n\"Since you my brother Ridolfo killed, I have little stomach for the\ntrade of brigand. It is true. But no longer is this trade necessary. We\nare rich. Had I a son to inherit your business, a different thought\nmight prevail; but I have only Tato, and a girl cannot be a successful\nbrigand.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" cried the old Duchessa, contemptuously. \"It is the\ngirl--always the girl--you make excuses for. But have I not ruled our\ndomain--I, who am a woman?\"\n\nTato herself answered, in a quiet voice.\n\n\"And what have you become, nonna, more than an outcast?\" she enquired.\n\"What use to you is money, or a power that the world would sneer at, did\nthe world even suspect that you exist? You are a failure in life, my\nnonna, and I will not be like you.\"\n\nThe Duchessa screamed an epithet and glared at the child as if she would\nannihilate her; but no fitting words to reply could she find.\n\nUncle John smiled delightedly. He felt no sense of humiliation or revolt\nat eavesdropping in this den of thieves, and to be able to gain so fair\na revelation of the inner life of this remarkable family was a diversion\nnot lightly to be foregone.\n\n\"So far, we have managed to escape the law,\" resumed the Duke. \"But\nalways it may not be our fortune to do this, if we continue this life.\nIt is now a good time to stop. Of one American we will gain a quarter of\na million lira--a fortune--and of the other one hundred and fifty\nthousand lira. With what we already have it is enough and more. Quietly\nwe will disband our men and go away. In another land we live the\nrespectable life, in peace with all, and Tato shall be the fine lady,\nand forget she once was a brigand's daughter.\"\n\nThe child sprang up in glee, and clasping her father's neck with both\narms kissed him with passionate earnestness.\n\nSilently the Duchessa watched the scene. Her face was as pallid and\nimmobile as ever; even the eyes seemed to have lost expression. But the\nnext words showed that she was still unconquered.\n\n\"You shall take the money of the fat pig of an American; it is well to\ndo so. But the youth who boldly calls himself Ferralti shall make no\ntribute to this family. He shall die as I have declared.\"\n\n\"I will not take the risk,\" asserted the Duke, sourly.\n\n\"Have the others who lie in the pit told tales?\" she demanded.\n\n\"No; but they died alone. Here are two Americans our prisoners, and\nthey have many and powerful friends, both at Taormina and at Naples. The\nman Merrick, when he goes, will tell that Ferralti is here. To obtain\nhis person, alive or dead, the soldiers will come here and destroy us\nall. It is folly, and shows you are old and imbecile.\"\n\n\"Then go!\" she cried, fiercely. \"Go, you and Tato; take your money and\nescape. And leave me my valley, and the youth Ferralti, and my revenge.\nThen, if I die, if the soldiers destroy me, it is my own doing.\"\n\n\"In this new world, of which you know nothing, escape is not possible,\"\nreplied the duke, after a moment's thought. \"Ferralti must be accounted\nfor, and because I captured him they would accuse me of his death, and\neven Tato might be made to suffer. No, madame. Both the Americans must\nbe killed, or both set free for ransom.\"\n\nUncle John gave a start of dismay. Here was a development he had not\nexpected.\n\n\"Then,\" said the old woman, positively, \"let them both die.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" exclaimed Tato. \"Not that, grandmother!\"\n\n\"Certainly not so,\" agreed the Duke. \"We want their money.\"\n\n\"You are already rich,\" said the Duchessa. \"You have yourself said so,\nand I know it is truth.\"\n\n\"This new world,\" explained the Duke, \"contains of luxuries many that\nyou have no understanding of. To be rich to-day requires more money than\nin your days, madre mia. With these ransoms, which already we have won,\nwe shall have enough. Without this money my Tato would lack much that I\ndesire for her. So of new murders I will take no risk, for the bambina's\nsake.\"\n\n\"And my revenge?\"\n\n\"Bah, of what use is it? Because the boy's father married my sister\nBianca, and ill-treated her, must we kill their offspring?\"\n\n\"He is his father's son. The father, you say, is dead, and so also is my\nchild Bianca. Then my hatred falls upon the son Arturo, and he must die\nto avenge the wrong to our race.\"\n\n\"More proof that you are imbecile,\" said the Duke, calmly. \"He shall not\ndie. He is nothing to us except a mine from whence to get gold.\"\n\n\"He is my grandson. I have a right to kill him.\"\n\n\"He is my nephew. He shall live.\"\n\n\"Do you defy me?\"\n\n\"With certainty. I defy you. The new world permits no crazy nonna to\nrule a family. That is my privilege. If you persist, it is you who shall\ngo to the pit. If you have reason, you shall remain in your garden in\npeace. Come, Tato; we will retire.\"\n\nHe arose and took the child's hand. The old woman sat staring at them in\nsilence, but with an evil glint in her glistening eyes.\n\nUncle John turned around and softly made his retreat from the garden.\nHis face wore a startled and horrified expression and on his forehead\nstood great beads of sweat that the sultriness of the day did not\naccount for.\n\nBut he thought better of Il Duca.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nTHE PIT\n\n\nThey met an hour later at luncheon, all but the Duchessa, who sulked in\nher garden. Tato was bright and smiling, filled with a suppressed joy\nwhich bubbled up in spite of the little one's effort to be dignified and\nsedate. When her hand stole under the table to find and press that of\nher father, Uncle John beamed upon her approvingly; for he knew what had\noccurred and could sympathize with her delight.\n\nThe Duke, however, was more sombre than usual. He had defied his mother,\nsuccessfully, so far; but he feared the terrible old woman more than did\nTato, because he knew more of her history and of the bold and wicked\ndeeds she had perpetrated in years gone by. Only once had a proposed\nvictim escaped her, and that was when her own daughter Bianca had fallen\nin love with an American held for ransom and spirited him away from the\nvalley through knowledge of the secret passage. It was well Bianca had\nfled with her lover; otherwise her mother would surely have killed her.\nBut afterward, when the girl returned to die in the old home, all was\nforgiven, and only the hatred of her foreign husband, whose cruelty had\ndriven her back to Sicily, remained to rankle in the old Duchessa's\nwicked heart.\n\nNo one knew her evil nature better than her son. He entertained a\nsuspicion that he had not conquered her by his recent opposition to her\nwill. Indeed, he would never have dared to brave her anger except for\nTato's sake. Tato was his idol, and in her defense the cowardly brigand\nhad for the moment become bold.\n\nTato laughed and chatted with Uncle John all through the meal, even\ntrying at times to cheer the doleful Ferralti, who was nearly as glum\nand unsociable as her father. The servants and brigands at the lower end\nof the table looked upon the little one admiringly. It was evident she\nwas a general favorite.\n\nOn the porch, after luncheon, the Duke broached the subject of the\nransoms again, still maintaining the fable of selling his antique\njewelry.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Uncle John, \"I'm going to submit gracefully, but upon one\ncondition.\"\n\nThe Duke scowled.\n\n\"I allow no conditions,\" he said.\n\n\"You'd better allow this one,\" Uncle John replied, \"because it will make\nit easier for all of us. Of my own free will and accord I will make a\npresent to Tato of fifty thousand dollars, and she shall have it for her\ndowry when she marries.\"\n\nTato clapped her hands.\n\n\"How did you know I am a girl, when I wear boys' clothes?\" she asked.\n\nEven the duke smiled, at that, but the next moment he shook his head\nsolemnly.\n\n\"It will not do, signore,\" he declared, answering Uncle John's\nproposition. \"This is a business affair altogether. You must purchase\nthe ring, and at once.\"\n\nThe little American sighed. It had been his last hope.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said; \"have your own way.\"\n\n\"You will send to your friends for the money?\"\n\n\"Whenever you say, Duke. You've got me in a hole, and I must wiggle out\nthe best way I can.\"\n\nThe brigand turned to Ferralti.\n\n\"And you, signore?\" he asked.\n\n\"I do not know whether I can get the money you demand.\"\n\n\"But you will make the attempt, as I shall direct?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then, signori, it is all finished. In a brief time you will leave my\nhospitable roof.\"\n\n\"The sooner the better,\" declared Ferralti.\n\nThey sat for a time in silence, each busy with his thoughts.\n\n\"Go to your grandmother, Tato,\" said the Duke, \"and try to make your\npeace with her. If she is too angry, do not remain. To-morrow you must\ngo into town with letters from these gentlemen to their friends.\"\n\nThe child kissed him and went obediently to do his will. Then the\nbrigand spoke to Tommaso, who brought writing material from the house\nand placed it upon a small table.\n\nUncle John, without further demur, sat down to write. The Duke dictated\nwhat he should say, although he was allowed to express the words in his\nown characteristic style, and he followed his instructions implicitly,\nsecretly admiring the shrewdness of the brigand's methods.\n\nIt was now Ferralti's turn. He had just seated himself at the table and\ntaken the pen when they were startled by a shrill scream from the rear\nof the house. It was followed by another, and another, in quick\nsuccession.\n\nIt was Tato's voice, and the duke gave an answering cry and sprang from\nthe veranda to dart quickly around the corner of the house. Uncle John\nfollowed him, nearly as fearful as the child's father.\n\nTommaso seized a short rifle that stood near and ran around the house in\nthe other direction, when Ferralti, who for a moment had seemed dazed by\nthe interruption, followed Tommaso rather than the others.\n\nAs they came to the rear they were amazed to see the old Duchessa, whom\nthey had known to be feeble and dependent upon her women, rush through\nthe garden hedge with the agility of a man, bearing in her arms the\nstruggling form of little Tato.\n\nThe child screamed pitifully, but the woman glared upon Tommaso and\nFerralti, as she passed them, with the ferocity of a tiger.\n\n\"She is mad!\" cried Ferralti. \"Quick, Tommaso; let us follow her.\"\n\nThe brigand bounded forward, with the young man scarce a pace behind\nhim. The woman, running with wonderful speed in spite of her burden,\nbegan to ascend a narrow path leading up the face of a rugged cliff.\n\nA yell of anguish from behind for a moment arrested Ferralti's rapid\npursuit. Glancing back he saw the Duke running frantically toward them,\nat the same time waving his arms high above his head.\n\n\"The pit!\" he shouted. \"She is making for the pit. Stop her, for the\nlove of God!\"\n\nFerralti understood, and dashed forward again at full speed. Tommaso\nalso understood, for his face was white and he muttered terrible oaths\nas he pressed on. Yet run as they might, the mad duchessa was inspired\nwith a strength so superhuman that she kept well in advance.\n\nBut the narrow path ended half way up the cliff. It ended at a deep\nchasm in the rocks, the edge of which was protected by a large flat\nstone, like the curb of a well.\n\nWith a final leap the old woman gained this stone, and while the\ndreadful pit yawned at her feet she turned, and with a demoniacal laugh\nfaced her pursuers, hugging the child close to her breast.\n\nTommaso and Ferralti, who were nearest, paused instinctively. It was now\nimpossible for them to prevent the tragedy about to be enacted. The\nDuke, spurred on by fear, was yet twenty paces in their rear, and in a\nmoment he also stopped, clasping his hands in a gesture of vain\nentreaty.\n\n\"Listen, Lugui!\" his mother called to him, in a dear, high voice. \"This\nis the child that has come between us and turned you from a man into a\ncoward. Here alone is the cause of our troubles. Behold! I will remove\nit forever from our path.\"\n\nWith the words she lifted Tato high above her head and turned toward the\npit--that terrible cleft in the rocks which was believed to have no\nbottom.\n\nAt her first movement Tommaso had raised his gun, and the Duke,\nperceiving this, called to him in an agonized voice to fire. But either\nthe brigand wavered between his loyalty to the Duke or the Duchessa, or\nhe feared to injure Tato, for he hesitated to obey and the moments were\nprecious.\n\nThe child's fate hung in the balance when Ferralti snatched the weapon\nfrom the brigand's hands and fired it so hastily that he scarcely seemed\nto take aim.\n\nA wild cry echoed the shot. The woman collapsed and fell, dropping Tato\nat her feet, where they both tottered at the edge of the pit. The child,\nhowever, clung desperately to the outer edge of the flat stone, while\nthe Duchessa's inert form seemed to hesitate for an instant and then\ndisappeared from view.\n\nTommaso ran forward and caught up the child, returning slowly along the\npath to place it in the father's arms. Ferralti was looking vaguely from\nthe weapon he held to the pit, and then back again, as if not fully\nunderstanding what he had done.\n\n\"Thank you, signore,\" said the Duke, brokenly, \"for saving my precious\nchild.\"\n\n\"But I have slain your mother!\" cried the young man, horrified.\n\n\"The obligation is even,\" replied the duke. \"She was also your\ngrandmother.\"\n\nFerralti stood motionless, his face working convulsively, his tongue\nrefusing to utter a sound.\n\n\"But he did not shoot my grandmother at all,\" said Tato, who was sobbing\nagainst her father's breast; \"for I heard the bullet strike the rock\nbeside us. My grandmother's strength gave way, and she fainted. It was\nthat that saved me, padre mia.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nNEWS AT LAST\n\n\nKenneth Forbes had always been an unusual boy. He had grown up in an\nunfriendly atmosphere, unloved and uncared for, and resented this\nneglect with all the force of his impetuous nature. He had hated Aunt\nJane, and regarded her as cruel and selfish--a fair estimate of her\ncharacter--until Aunt Jane's nieces taught him to be more considerate\nand forgiving. Patricia, especially, had exercised a gentler influence\nupon the arbitrary youth, and as a consequence they had become staunch\nfriends.\n\nWhen the unexpected inheritance of a fortune changed the boy's condition\nfrom one of dependence to one of importance he found he had no longer\nany wrongs to resent; therefore his surly and brusque moods gradually\ndisappeared, and he became a pleasant companion to those he cared for.\nWith strangers he still remained reserved and suspicious, and\noccasionally the old sullen fits would seize him and it was well to\navoid his society while they lasted.\n\nOn his arrival at Taormina, Kenneth had entered earnestly into the\nsearch for Uncle John, whom he regarded most affectionately; and, having\npassed the day tramping over the mountains, he would fill the evening\nwith discussions and arguments with the nieces concerning the fate of\ntheir missing uncle.\n\nBut as the days dragged wearily away the search slackened and was\nfinally abandoned. Kenneth set up his easel in the garden and began to\npaint old Etna, with its wreath of snow and the soft gray cloud of vapor\nthat perpetually hovered over it.\n\n\"Anyone with half a soul could paint that!\" said Patsy; and as a proof\nof her assertion the boy did very well indeed, except that his\nuneasiness on Mr. Merrick's account served to distract him more or less.\n\nNor was Kenneth the only uneasy one. Mr. Watson, hard-headed man of\nresource as he was, grew more and more dejected as he realized the\nimpossibility of interesting the authorities in the case. The Sicilian\nofficials were silent and uncommunicative; the Italians wholly\nindifferent. If strangers came to Taormina and got into difficulties,\nthe government was in no way to blame. It was their duty to tolerate\ntourists, but those all too energetic foreigners must take care of\nthemselves.\n\nProbably Mr. Watson would have cabled the State Department at Washington\nfor assistance had he not expected each day to put him in communication\nwith his friend, and in the end he congratulated himself upon his\npatience. The close of the week brought a sudden and startling change in\nthe situation.\n\nThe girls sat on the shaded terrace one afternoon, watching the picture\nof Etna grow under Kenneth's deft touches, when they observed a child\napproaching them with shy diffidence. It was a beautiful Sicilian boy,\nwith wonderful brown eyes and a delicate profile. After assuring himself\nthat the party of young Americans was quite separate from any straggling\nguest of the hotel, the child came near enough to say, in a low tone:\n\n\"I have a message from Signor Merrick.\"\n\nThey crowded around him eagerly then, raining questions from every side;\nbut the boy shrank away and said, warningly:\n\n\"If we are overheard, signorini mia, it will be very bad. No one must\nsuspect that I am here.\"\n\n\"Is my uncle well?\" asked Patsy, imploringly.\n\n\"Quite well, mees.\"\n\n\"And have you also news of Count Ferralti?\" anxiously enquired Louise.\n\n\"Oh, Ferralti? He is better. Some teeth are knocked out, but he eats\nvery well without them,\" replied the child, with an amused laugh.\n\n\"Where are our friends, my lad?\" Kenneth asked.\n\n\"I cannot describe the place, signore; but here are letters to explain\nall.\" The child produced a bulky package, and after a glance at each, in\nturn, placed it in Patsy's hands. \"Read very secretly, signorini, and\ndecide your course of action. To-morrow I will come for your answer. In\nthe meantime, confide in no one but yourselves. If you are indiscreet,\nyou alone will become the murderers of Signor Merrick and the sad young\nFerralti.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked Beth, examining the child closely.\n\n\"I am called Tato, signorina mia.\"\n\n\"Where do you live?\"\n\n\"It is all explained in the letters, believe me.\"\n\nBeth glanced at Patricia, who was examining the package, and now all\ncrowded around for a glimpse of Uncle John's well-known handwriting. The\nwrapper was inscribed:\n\n     _\"To Miss Doyle, Miss De Graf and Miss Merrick,_\n                                 _Hotel Castello-a-Mare, Taormina._\n       _By the safe hands of Tato.\"_\n\nInside were two letters, one addressed to Louise personally. She seized\nthis and ran a little distance away, while Beth took Uncle John's letter\nfrom Patsy's trembling hands, and having opened it read aloud in a\nclear and composed voice the following:\n\n     \"My dear Nieces: (and also my dear friends, Silas Watson and\n     Kenneth Forbes, if they are with you) Greeting! You have\n     perhaps been wondering at my absence, which I will explain\n     by saying that I am visiting a noble acquaintance in a very\n     cozy and comfortable retreat which I am sure would look\n     better from a distance. My spirits and health are A No. 1\n     and it is my intention to return to you as soon as you have\n     executed a little commission for me, which I want you to do\n     exactly as I hereby instruct you. In other words, if you\n     don't execute the commission you will probably execute me.\n\n     \"I have decided to purchase a valuable antique ring from my\n     host, at a price of fifty thousand dollars, which trifling\n     sum I must have at once to complete the transaction, for\n     until full payment is made I cannot rejoin you. Therefore\n     you must hasten to raise the dough. Here's the programme, my\n     dear girls: One of you must go by first train to Messina and\n     cable Isham, Marvin & Co. to deposit with the New York\n     correspondents of the Banca Commerciale Italiana fifty\n     thousand dollars, and have instructions cabled to the\n     Messina branch of that bank to pay the sum to the written\n     order of John Merrick. This should all be accomplished\n     within twenty-four hours. Present the enclosed order,\n     together with my letter of credit and passport, which will\n     identify my signature, and draw the money in cash. Return\n     with it to Taormina and give it secretly to the boy Tato,\n     who will bring it to me. I will rejoin you within three\n     hours after I have paid for the ring.\n\n     \"This may seem a strange proceeding to you, my dears, but\n     you must not hesitate to accomplish it--if you love me.\n     Should my old friend Silas Watson be now with you, as I\n     expect him to be, he will assist you to do my bidding, for\n     he will be able to realize, better than I can now explain,\n     how important it is to me.\n\n     \"Also I beg you to do a like service for Count Ferralti, who\n     is entrusting his personal commission, to Louise. He also\n     must conclude an important purchase before he can return to\n     Taormina.\n\n     \"More than this I am not permitted to say in this letter.\n     Confide in no stranger, or official of any sort, and act as\n     secretly and quietly as possible. I hope soon to be with\n     you.\n\n     \"Very affectionately,         UNCLE JOHN.\"\n\n\"What does it all mean?\" asked Patsy, bewildered, when Beth had finished\nreading.\n\n\"Why, it is clear enough, I'm sure,\" said Kenneth. \"Uncle John is\nimprisoned by brigands, and the money he requires is his ransom. We must\nget it as soon as possible, you know, and luckily he is so rich that he\nwon't miss this little draft at all.\"\n\nBeth sat silent, angrily staring at the letter.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Patsy, hesitating, \"the robbers will do the dear uncle\nsome mischief, if he doesn't pay.\"\n\n\"Just knock him on the head, that's all,\" said the boy. \"But there's no\nneed to worry. We can get the money easily.\"\n\nSuddenly Beth jumped up.\n\n\"Where's that girl?\" she demanded, sharply.\n\n\"What girl?\"\n\n\"Tato.\"\n\n\"Tato, my dear coz, is a boy,\" answered Kenneth; \"and he disappeared\nages ago.\"\n\n\"You must be blind,\" said Beth, scornfully, \"not to recognize a girl\nwhen you see one. A boy, indeed!\"\n\n\"Why, he dressed like a boy,\" replied Kenneth, hesitatingly.\n\n\"So much the more disgraceful,\" sniffed Beth. \"She belongs to those\nbrigands, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Looks something like Victor Valdi,\" said Patsy, thoughtfully.\n\n\"Il Duca? Of course! I see it myself, now. Patricia, it is that wicked\nduke who has captured Uncle John.\"\n\n\"I had guessed that,\" declared Patsy, smiling.\n\n\"He must be a handsome rascal,\" observed Kenneth, \"for the child is\npretty as a picture.\"\n\n\"He isn't handsome at all,\" replied Beth; \"but there is a look about the\nchild's eyes that reminds me of him.\"\n\n\"That's it, exactly,\" agreed Patsy.\n\nLouise now approached them with a white, frightened face.\n\n\"Isn't it dreadful!\" she moaned. \"They are going to kill Ferralti unless\nhe gives them thirty thousand dollars.\"\n\n\"And I don't believe he can raise thirty cents,\" said Patsy, calmly.\n\n\"Oh, yes, he can,\" answered Louise, beginning to cry. \"Hi--his--father\nis d--dead, and has left him--a--fortune.\"\n\n\"Don't blubber, Lou,\" said the boy, chidingly; \"in that case your dago\nfriend is as well off as need be. But I suppose you're afraid the\nno-account Count won't figure his life is worth thirty thousand dollars.\nIt does seem like an awful price to pay for a foreigner.\"\n\n\"It isn't that,\" said Louise, striving to control her emotion. \"He says\nhe hates to be robbed. He wouldn't pay a penny if he could help it.\"\n\n\"Good for the Count! I don't blame him a bit,\" exclaimed Beth. \"It is a\nbeastly shame that free born Americans should be enslaved by a crew of\nthieving Sicilians, and obliged to purchase their freedom!\"\n\n\"True for you,\" said Kenneth, nodding. \"But what are we going to do\nabout it?\"\n\n\"Pay, of course,\" decided Patsy, promptly. \"Our Uncle John is too\nprecious to be sacrificed for all the money in the world. Come; let's go\nand find Mr. Watson. We ought not to lose a moment's time.\"\n\nThe lawyer read Uncle John's letter carefully, as well as the one from\nCount Ferralti, which Louise confided to him with the request that he\nkeep the young man's identity a secret for a time, until he could reveal\nit to her cousins in person.\n\n\"The only thing to be done,\" announced Mr. Watson, \"is to carry out\nthese instructions faithfully. We can send the cable messages from here,\nand in the morning Louise and I will take the train for Messina and\nremain there until we get the money.\"\n\n\"It's an outrage!\" cried Beth.\n\n\"Of course, my dear. But it can't be helped. And your uncle is wise to\ntake the matter so cheerfully. After all, it is little enough to pay\nfor one's life and liberty, and our friend is so wealthy that he will\nnever feel the loss at all.\"\n\n\"It isn't that; it's the principle of the thing that I object to,\" said\nthe girl. \"It's downright disgraceful to be robbed so easily.\"\n\n\"To be sure; but the disgrace is Italy's, not ours. Object all you want\nto, Beth, dear,\" continued the old lawyer, smiling at her; \"but\nnevertheless we'll pay as soon as possible, and have done with it. What\nwe want now is your Uncle John, and we want him mighty badly.\"\n\n\"Really, the pirates didn't charge enough for him,\" added Patsy.\n\nSo Mr. Watson sent the cables to John Merrick's bankers and Count\nFerralti's attorney, and the next morning went with Louise to Messina.\n\nFrascatti drove all the party down the road to the station at Giardini,\nand as the train pulled out, Beth, who had remained seated in the\nvictoria with Patricia and Kenneth, suddenly stood up to pull the\n_vetturino's_ sleeve.\n\n\"Tell me, Frascatti,\" she whispered, \"isn't that Il Duca's child?\nLook--that little one standing in the corner?\"\n\n\"Why, yes; it is really Tato,\" answered the man, before he thought to\ndeny it.\n\n\"Very well; you may now drive us home,\" returned Beth, a shade of\ntriumph in her voice.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nBETH BEGINS TO PLOT\n\n\nOnce back in their sitting-room behind closed doors, Beth, Patsy and\nKenneth got their three heads together and began eagerly to discuss a\nplot which Beth had hinted of on the way home and now unfolded in\ndetail. And while they still whispered together a knock at the door\nstartled them and made them look rather guilty until the boy answered\nthe call and admitted little Tato.\n\nThe child's beautiful face wore a smile of demure satisfaction as Tato\nbowed respectfully to the young Americans.\n\nKenneth winked at Beth from behind the visitor's back.\n\n\"As you have a guest,\" he remarked, with a yawn that was somewhat rude,\n\"I shall now go and take my nap.\"\n\n\"What, do you sleep so early in the day, you lazy-bones?\" asked Patsy,\nbrightly.\n\n\"Any time, my dear, is good enough for an overworked artist,\" he\nreplied. \"Au revoir, my cousins. See you at luncheon.\"\n\nWith this he strolled away, and when he had gone Beth said to Tato:\n\n\"Won't you sit down, signorina?\"\n\n\"Do you mean me?\" asked the child, as if surprised.\n\n\"Yes; I can see plainly that you are a girl.\"\n\n\"And a pretty one, too, my dear,\" added Patsy.\n\nTato blushed as if embarrassed, but in a moment smiled upon the American\ngirls.\n\n\"Do you think me immodest, then?\" she asked, anxiously.\n\n\"By no means, my dear,\" Beth assured her. \"I suppose you have an\nexcellent reason for wearing boys' clothes.\"\n\n\"So I have, signorina. I live in the mountains, where dresses catch in\nthe crags, and bother a girl. And my father has always been heart-broken\nbecause he had no son, and likes to see me in this attire. He has many\nerrands for me, too, where a boy may go unnoticed, yet a girl would\nattract too much attention. This is one of the errands, signorini. But\nnow tell me, if you please, how have you decided to answer the letters\nof Signor Merrick and Signor Ferralti?\"\n\n\"Oh, there was but one way to answer them, Tato,\" replied Beth,\ncomposedly. \"We have sent Mr. Watson and our cousin Louise Merrick to\nMessina to get the money. If our friends in America act promptly Mr.\nWatson and Louise will return by to-morrow afternoon's train, and be\nprepared to make the payment.\"\n\n\"That is well, signorina,\" responded Tato.\n\n\"We are to give the money to you, I suppose?\" said Patsy.\n\n\"Yes; I will return for it to-morrow afternoon,\" answered the child,\nwith business-like gravity. Then she looked earnestly from one to the\nother of the two girls. \"You must act discreetly, in the meantime, you\nknow. You must not talk to anyone, or do anything to imperil your\nuncle's safety.\"\n\n\"Of course not, Tato.\"\n\n\"I beg you not, signorini. The uncle is a good man, and brave. I do not\nwish him to be injured.\"\n\n\"Nor do we, Tato.\"\n\n\"And the young man is not a coward, either. He has been kind to me. But\nhe is sad, and not so pleasant to talk with as the uncle.\"\n\n\"True enough, Tato,\" said Beth.\n\nPatsy had been examining the child with curious intentness. The little\none was so lovely and graceful, and her voice sounded so soft and\nwomanly, that Patsy longed to take her in her arms and hug her.\n\n\"How old are you, dear?\" she asked.\n\nTato saw the friendly look, and answered with a smile.\n\n\"Perhaps as old as you, signorina, although I am so much smaller. I\nshall be fifteen in a month.\"\n\n\"So old!\"\n\nTato laughed merrily.\n\n\"Ah, you might well say 'so young,' amico mia! To be grown up is much\nnicer; do you not think so? And then I shall not look such a baby as\nnow, and have people scold me when I get in the way, as they do little\nbambini.\"\n\n\"But when you are grown you cannot wear boys' clothing, either.\"\n\nTato sighed.\n\n\"We have a saying in Sicily that 'each year has its sunshine and rain,'\nwhich means its sorrow and its joy,\" she answered. \"Perhaps I sometimes\nthink more of the tears than of the laughter, although I know that is\nwrong. Not always shall I be a mountaineer, and then the soft dresses of\nthe young girls shall be my portion. Will I like them better? I do not\nknow. But I must go now, instead of chattering here. Farewell,\nsignorini, until to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Will you not remain with us?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; although you are kind. I am expected home. But to-morrow I will\ncome for the money. You will be silent?\"\n\n\"Surely, Tato.\"\n\nThe child smiled upon them pleasantly. It was a relief to deal with two\ntender girls instead of cold and resentful men, such as she had\nsometimes met. At the door she blew a kiss to them, and darted away.\n\nIn the courtyard Frascatti saw her gliding out and discreetly turned his\nhead the other way.\n\nTato took the old road, circling around the theatre and through the\nnarrow, winding streets of the lower town to the Catania Gate. She\nlooked back one or twice, but no one noticed her. If any of the\nvillagers saw her approaching they slipped out of her path.\n\nOnce on the highway, however, Tato became lost in reflection. Her\nmission being successfully accomplished, it required no further thought;\nbut the sweet young American girls had made a strong impression upon the\nlonely Sicilian maid, and she dreamed of their pretty gowns and ribbons,\ntheir fresh and comely faces, and the gentleness of their demeanor.\n\nTato was not gentle. She was wild and free and boyish, and had no pretty\ngowns whatever. But what then? She must help her father to get his\nfortune, and then he had promised her that some day they would go to\nParis or Cairo and live in the world, and be brigands no longer.\n\nShe would like that, she thought, as she clambered up the steep paths;\nand perhaps she would meet these American girls again, or others like\nthem, and make them her friends. She had never known a girl friend, as\nyet.\n\nThese ambitions would yesterday have seemed far in the dim future; but\nnow that her stern old grandmother was gone it was possible her father\nwould soon fulfill his promises. While the Duchessa lived she ruled them\nall, and she was a brigand to the backbone. Now her father's will\nprevailed, and he could refuse his child nothing.\n\nKenneth was not an expert detective, but he had managed to keep Tato in\nsight without being suspected by her. He had concealed himself near the\nCatania Gate, through which he knew she must pass, and by good luck she\nhad never looked around once, so intent were her musings.\n\nWhen she came to the end of the path and leaned against the rock to sing\nthe broken refrain which was the \"open sesame\" to the valley, the boy\nwas hidden snug behind a boulder where he could watch her every\nmovement.\n\nThen the rock opened; Tato passed in, and the opening closed behind her.\n\nKenneth found a foothold and climbed up the wall of rock, higher and\nhigher, until at last he crept upon a high ridge and looked over.\n\nThe hidden valley lay spread before him in all its beauty, but the\nprecipice at his feet formed a sheer drop of a hundred feet or more, and\nhe drew back with a shudder.\n\nThen he took courage to look again, and observed the house, on the porch\nof which stood Tato engaged in earnest conversation with a tall, dark\nSicilian. Uncle John was nowhere to be seen, but the boy understood that\nhe was there, nevertheless, and realized that his prison was so secure\nthat escape was impossible.\n\nAnd now he climbed down again, a much more difficult feat than getting\nup. But although he was forced to risk his life several times, he was\nagile and clear-headed, and finally dropped to the path that led to the\nsecret door of the passage.\n\nHis next thought was to mark the exact location of the place, so that he\ncould find it again; and as he returned slowly along the paths through\nthe rocky fissures he took mental note of every curve and communication,\nand believed he could now find his way to the retreat of the brigands at\nany time he chose.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nPATSY'S NEW FRIEND\n\n\n\"I must say that I don't like the job,\" said Patsy, the next morning, as\nshe stood by the window and faced Beth and Kenneth. \"Suppose we fail?\"\n\n\"In the bright lexicon of youth--\"\n\n\"Shut up, Ken. If we fail,\" said Beth, \"we will be no worse off than\nbefore.\"\n\n\"And if we win,\" added the boy, \"they'll think twice before they try to\nrob Americans again.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm with you, anyhow,\" declared Patricia. \"I can see it's risky,\nall right; but as you say, no great harm will be done if we slip up.\"\n\n\"You,\" announced Beth, gravely, \"must be the captain.\"\n\n\"It isn't in me, dear. You figured the thing out, and Ken and I will\nfollow your lead.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Beth, decidedly; \"I'm not quick enough, either in thought or\naction, to be a leader, Patsy. And there's a bit of deception required\nthat I couldn't manage. That clever little thing, Tato, would know at\nonce I was up to some mischief; but she would never suspect you.\"\n\n\"I like that compliment,\" replied Patricia. \"I may deserve it, of\ncourse; but it strikes me Louise is the one best fitted for such work.\"\n\n\"We can't let Louise into this plot,\" said the boy, positively; \"she'd\nspoil it all.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly, Patsy,\" said Beth. \"You're genuine and frank, and the\nchild likes you. I could see that yesterday. All you have to do is to be\nnice to her and win her confidence; and then, when the climax comes, you\nmust be the spokesman and talk straight out from the shoulder. You can\ndo that all right.\"\n\n\"I'll bet on her,\" cried Kenneth, with an admiring look at the girl.\n\n\"Then,\" said Patsy, \"it is all arranged, and I'm the captain. And is it\nagreed that we won't lisp a word to Mr. Watson or Louise?\"\n\n\"Not a word.\"\n\n\"Here,\" said Kenneth, drawing a revolver from his pocket, \"is Uncle\nJohn's pop-gun. It's the only one I could find in his room, so he must\nhave taken the other with him. Be careful of it, Patsy, for it's loaded\nall 'round. Can you shoot?\"\n\n\"No; but I suppose the pistol can. I know enough to pull the trigger.\"\n\n\"And when you do, remember to point it away from your friends. Now hide\nit, my dear, and be careful of it.\"\n\nPatsy concealed the weapon in the bosom of her dress, not without making\na wry face and shivering a bit.\n\n\"Have you got your revolver, Beth?\" asked the boy.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And she can shoot just wonderfully!\" exclaimed Patsy. \"Yesterday she\npicked an orange off a tree with a bullet. You should have seen her.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Ken, nodding. \"I've seen Beth shoot before, and she's our\nmain reliance in this conspiracy. For my part, I can hit a mark\nsometimes, and sometimes I can't. See here.\" He exhibited a beautiful\npearl and silver-mounted weapon which he drew from his pocket. \"Mr.\nWatson and I have carried revolvers ever since we came to Sicily, but\nwe've never had occasion to use them. I can hardly believe, even now,\nthat this beautiful place harbors brigands. It's such a romantic\nincident in our prosaic world of to-day. And now, young ladies, we are\narmed to the teeth and can defy an army. Eh, Captain Pat?\"\n\n\"If you're not more respectful,\" said the girl, \"I'll have you\ncourt-marshalled and drummed out of camp.\"\n\nOn the afternoon train came Louise and Mr. Watson from Messina. The\nAmerican agents had responded promptly, and the bank had honored the\norders and delivered the money without delay.\n\n\"It is all safe in my satchel,\" said the lawyer, as they rode together\nto the hotel; \"and our dear friends are as good as rescued already. It's\npretty bulky, Kenneth--four hundred thousand lira--but it is all in\nnotes on the Banca d'Italia, for we couldn't manage gold.\"\n\n\"Quite a haul for the brigand,\" observed Kenneth, thoughtfully.\n\n\"True; but little enough for the lives of two men. That is the way I\nlook at the transaction. And, since our friends can afford the loss, we\nmust be as cheerful over the thing as possible. It might have been a\ntragedy, you know.\"\n\nLouise shivered.\n\n\"I'm glad it is all over,\" she said, gratefully.\n\nThe conspirators looked at one another and smiled, but held their peace.\n\nArriving at the hotel, Beth and Kenneth at once disappeared, saying they\nwere going to town, as they would not be needed longer. Patsy\naccompanied their cousin and the lawyer to the sitting-room, where\npresently Tato came to them.\n\n\"Well, little one,\" said the lawyer, pleasantly, \"We have secured the\nmoney required to enable Mr. Merrick to purchase the ring, and\nMr.--er--Count Ferralti to buy his bracelet. Will you count it?\"\n\n\"Yes, signore, if you please,\" replied Tato, with a sober face.\n\nMr. Watson drew out two packages of bank notes and placed them upon the\ntable. The child, realizing the importance of the occasion, carefully\ncounted each bundle, and then replaced the wrappers.\n\n\"The amounts are correct, signore,\" she said. \"I thank you for making my\ntask so easy. And now I will go.\"\n\nThe lawyer brought a newspaper and wrapped the money in it once again.\n\n\"It is always dangerous to carry so much money,\" said he; \"but now no\none will be likely to suspect the contents of your package.\"\n\nTato smiled.\n\n\"No one would care to molest me,\" she said; \"for they fear those that\nprotect me. Good afternoon, signore. Your friends will be with you in\ntime to dine in your company. Good afternoon, signorini,\" turning to\nPatsy and Louise.\n\n\"I'll walk a little way with you; may I?\" asked Patsy, smiling into\nTato's splendid eyes.\n\n\"To be sure, signorina,\" was the quick response.\n\nPatricia caught up a sunshade and followed the child out at the side\nentrance, which was little used. Tato took the way along the old road,\nand Patsy walked beside her, chatting brightly of the catacombs, the\nNorman villa that showed its checkered tower above the trees and the\nancient wall that still hemmed in the little village.\n\n\"I love Taormina,\" she said, earnestly, \"and shall be sorry to leave it.\nYou must be very happy, Tato, to be able to live here always.\"\n\n\"It is my birthplace,\" she said; \"but I long to get away from it and see\nother countries. The view is fine, they say; but it tires me. The air is\nsweet and pure; but it oppresses me. The climate is glorious; but I have\nhad enough of it. In other places there is novelty, and many things that\nSicily knows nothing of.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" replied Patsy, tucking the little one's arm underneath\nher own, with a sympathetic gesture. \"I know just how you feel, Tato.\nYou must come to America some day, and visit me. I will make you very\nwelcome, dear, and you shall be my friend.\"\n\nThe child looked into her face earnestly.\n\n\"You do not hate me, signorina, because--because--\"\n\n\"Because why?\"\n\n\"Because my errand to you has been so lawless and--and--unfriendly?\"\n\n\"Ah, Tato, you do not choose this life, do you?\"\n\n\"No, signorina.\"\n\n\"It is forced on you by circumstances, is it not?\"\n\n\"Truly, signorina.\"\n\n\"I know. You would not long so wistfully to change your condition if you\nenjoyed being a little brigand. But nothing that has passed must\ninterfere with our friendship, dear. If I were in your place, you see, I\nwould do just as you have done. It is not a very honest life, Tato, nor\none to be proud of; but I'm not going to blame you one bit.\"\n\nThey had passed the Catania Gate and reached the foot of one of the\nmountain paths. Tato paused, hesitatingly.\n\n\"Oh, I'll go a little farther,\" said Patsy, promptly. \"No one will\nnotice two girls, you know. Shall I carry your parcel for a time?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the child, hugging it close with her disengaged arm. But\nshe offered no objection when Patsy continued to walk by her side.\n\n\"Have you any brothers or sisters, Tato?\"\n\n\"No, signorina.\"\n\n\"Have you a mother?\"\n\n\"No, signorina. My father and I are alone.\"\n\n\"I know him well, Tato. We were on the ship together, crossing the\nocean. He was gruff and disagreeable, but I made him talk to me and\nsmile.\"\n\n\"I know; he has told me of the Signorina Patsy. He is fond of you.\"\n\n\"Yet he robbed my uncle.\"\n\nThe child flushed, and drew away her arm.\n\n\"That is it. That is why you should hate me,\" she replied, bitterly. \"I\nknow it is robbery, and brigandage, although my father masks it by\nsaying he sells antiques. Until now I have seen nothing wrong in this\nlife, signorina; but you have made me ashamed.\"\n\n\"Why, dear?\"\n\n\"Because you are so good and gentle, and so forgiving.\"\n\nPatsy laughed.\n\n\"In reality, Tato, I am resentful and unforgiving. You will find out,\nsoon, that I am a very human girl, and then I will not make you ashamed.\nBut your father's business is shameful, nevertheless.\"\n\nTato was plainly puzzled, and knew not what to reply. But just then they\nreached the end of the crevasse, and the child said:\n\n\"You must return now, Signorina Patsy.\"\n\n\"But why cannot I go on with you, and come back with my uncle?\"\n\nTato hesitated. Accustomed as she was to duplicity and acting, in her\ncapacity as lure for her thieving father, the child was just now\nsoftened by Patsy's kindly manner and the successful accomplishment of\nher mission. She had no thought of any treachery or deception on the\npart of the American girl, and the request seemed to her natural\nenough.\n\n\"If you like,\" she decided, \"you may come as far as the barrier, and\nthere wait for your uncle. It will not be long.\"\n\n\"Very well, dear.\"\n\nTato clambered over the dividing rock and dropped into the path beyond.\nPatsy sprang lightly after her. A short distance farther and they\nreached the barrier.\n\n\"This is the place, signorina. You will sit upon that stone, and wait\nuntil your uncle appears.\" She hesitated, and then added, softly: \"I may\nnot see you again. But you will not forget me?\"\n\n\"Never, Tato. And if you come to America you must not forget to visit\nme. Remember, whatever happens, that we are friends, and must always\nremain so.\"\n\nThe child nodded, gratefully. Then, leaning against the face of the\ncliff, she raised her voice and warbled clearly the bit of song that\nserved as the signal to her father.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nTURNING THE TABLES\n\n\nNo sooner had the notes ceased than Kenneth sprang from behind a rock\nthat had concealed him and grasped the child in his strong arms, trying\nto cover her mouth at the same time to prevent her from crying out.\n\nTato developed surprising strength. The adventure of yesterday had so\nthoroughly frightened her that when she found herself again seized she\nstruggled madly. The boy found that he could scarcely hold her, so he\nenfolded her in both his arms and, letting her scream as she might,\npicked up her tiny form and mounted the slope of the hill, leaping from\nrock to rock until he came to a broad boulder twenty feet or more above\nthe path. Here he paused, panting, and awaited results.\n\nThe rock doors had opened promptly. Even while Kenneth struggled with\nthe brigand's daughter Patsy could see straight through the tunnel and\ninto the valley beyond. The child had dropped her bundle in the effort\nto escape, and while Kenneth was leaping with her up the crags Patsy ran\nforward and secured the money, returning quickly to her position facing\nthe tunnel.\n\nAnd now they heard shouts and the sound of hastening feet as Il Duca ran\nfrom the tunnel, followed closely by two of his brigands. They paused a\nmoment at the entrance, as if bewildered, but when the father saw his\nchild in the grasp of a stranger and heard her screams he answered with\na roar of fury and prepared to scramble up the rock to rescue her.\n\nThat was where Patsy showed her mettle. She hastily covered the brigand\nwith her revolver and shouted warningly:\n\n\"Stop, or you are a dead man!\"\n\nIt was wonderfully dramatic and effective.\n\nIl Duca shrank back, scowling, for he had no weapon at hand. Leaning\nagainst the entrance to his valley he glared around to determine the\nnumber of his foes and the probable chance of defeating them.\n\nKenneth laughed boyishly at his discomfiture. Kneeling down, the youth\ngrasped Tato by both wrists and lowered her body over the edge of the\nrock so that her feet just touched a little ledge beneath. He continued\nto hold fast to her wrists, though, and there she remained, stretched\nagainst the face of the rock fronting the path, in full view of all, but\nstill unable to move.\n\nFrom this exasperating sight Il Duca glanced at Patsy. She was holding\nthe revolver rigidly extended, and her blue eyes blazed with the\nexcitement of the moment. It was a wonder she did not pull the trigger\ninadvertently, and the thought that she might do so caused the brigand\nto shudder.\n\nTurning half around he beheld a third enemy quietly seated upon the\nrocks directly across the path from Kenneth, her pose unconcerned as she\nrested her chin lightly upon her left hand. It was Beth, who held her\nrevolver nonchalantly and gazed upon the scene below her with calm\ninterest.\n\nThe Duke gave a cough to clear his throat. His men hung back of him,\nsilent and motionless, for they did not like this absolute and dangerous\ndefiance of their chief.\n\n\"Tell me, then, Tato,\" he called in English, \"what is the cause of this\ntrouble?\"\n\n\"I do not know, my father, except that these are friends of Signor\nMerrick who have secretly followed me here.\"\n\nThe carefully arranged programme gave Patsy a speech at this point, but\nshe had entirely forgotten it.\n\n\"Let me explain,\" said Beth, coldly. \"You have dared to detain in your\nrobbers' den the persons of Mr. Merrick and Count Ferralti. You have\nalso demanded a ransom for their release. That is brigandage, which is\ndenounced by the laws of Sicily. We have appealed to the authorities,\nbut they are helpless to assist us. Therefore, being Americans, we have\ndecided to assist ourselves. We command you to deliver to us on this\nspot, safe and uninjured, the persons of our friends, and that without\nany unnecessary delay.\"\n\nThe Duke listened with a sneer.\n\n\"And if we refuse, signorina?\"\n\n\"If you refuse--if you do not obey at once--I swear that I will shoot\nyour child, Tato, whose body yonder awaits my bullet. And afterward I\nshall kill you.\"\n\nAs she spoke she levelled the revolver and aimed it carefully at the\nexposed body of the child.\n\nThe brigand paled, and grasped the rock to steady himself.\n\n\"Bah! No girl can shoot from that distance,\" he exclaimed, scornfully.\n\n\"Indeed! Take care of your finger,\" called Beth, and a shot echoed\nsharply along the mountain side.\n\nThe brigand jumped and uttered a yell, at the same time whipping his\nright hand underneath his left arm; for Beth's bullet had struck one of\nhis fingers and then flattened itself against the cliff.\n\nThat settled all argument, as far as Il Duca was concerned; for he now\nhad ample evidence that the stern-eyed girl above him could shoot, and\nwas not to be trifled with. All his life he had ruled by the terror of\nhis threats; to-day he was suddenly vanquished by a determination he\ndared not withstand.\n\n\"Enough!\" he cried. \"Have your way.\"\n\nHe spoke to his men in Italian, and they hastened through the tunnel,\nglad to escape.\n\nFollowing their departure there was a brief silence, during which all\nstood alert. Then, Tato, still half suspended against the cliff, said in\na clear, soft voice:\n\n\"Father, if you think you can escape, let them shoot me, and keep your\nprisoners. The money for their ransom I brought to this place, and they\nwill pay it even yet to save their friends from your vengeance. Do not\nlet these wild Americans defeat us, I beg of you. I am not afraid. Save\nyourself, and let them shoot me, if they will!\"\n\nKenneth afterward declared that he thought \"the jig was up\" then, for\nthey had no intention whatever of harming Tato. It was all merely a bit\nof American \"bluff,\" and it succeeded because the brigand was a coward,\nand dared not emulate his daughter's courage.\n\n\"No, no, Tato!\" cried the Duke, brokenly, as he wrung his hands in\nanguish. \"There is more money to be had, but I have only one child. They\nshall not harm a hair of your head, my pretty one!\"\n\nPatsy wanted to yell \"bravo!\" but wisely refrained. Her eyes were full\nof tears, though, and her resolution at ebb tide.\n\nFortunately the men had made haste. They returned with surprising\npromptness, pushing the amazed prisoners before them.\n\nUncle John, as he emerged from the tunnel, looked around upon the tragic\nscene and gasped:\n\n\"Well, I declare!\"\n\nCount Ferralti was more composed, if equally surprised. He lifted his\nhat politely to Beth and Patsy, and smiled with great satisfaction.\n\n\"You are free,\" said Il Duca, harshly. \"Go!\"\n\nThey lost no time in getting the brigands between themselves and the\nmouth of the tunnel, and then Kenneth gently drew Tato to a place beside\nhim and assisted her to clamber down the path.\n\n\"Good bye, little one,\" he said, pleasantly; \"you're what we call a\n'brick' in our country. I like you, and I'm proud of you.\"\n\nTato did not reply. With streaming eyes she was examining her father's\nshattered hand, and sobbing at sight of the blood that dripped upon the\nrocks at his feet.\n\n\"Get inside!\" called Beth, sharply; \"and close up that rock. Lively,\nnow!\"\n\nThe \"girl who could shoot\" still sat toying with her revolver, and the\nmountaineers obeyed her injunction. The rock promptly closed, and the\ngroup of Americans was left alone.\n\nThen Beth came slowly down to where Patsy was hugging Uncle John in a\nwild frenzy of delight, and Count Ferralti was shaking Kenneth's hand\nwith a face eloquent of emotion.\n\n\"Come,\" said she, her voice sounding faint and weary, \"let us get away\nfrom here. It was a pretty game, while it lasted, but I'll feel safer\nwhen we are home again. Where's the money?\"\n\n\"I've got it,\" said Kenneth, holding up the package.\n\n\"What! didn't you pay?\" demanded Uncle John, astounded.\n\n\"Of course not, dear,\" said Patsy, gleefully. \"Did you think your nieces\nwould let you be robbed by a bunch of dagoes?\"\n\nFerralti caught hold of Beth's swaying form.\n\n\"Look after your cousin,\" he said, sharply. \"I think she has fainted!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nTHE COUNT UNMASKS\n\n\n\"And now,\" said Uncle John, as he sat in their cosy sitting-room,\npropped in an easy chair with his feet upon a stool, \"it's about time\nfor you to give an account of yourselves, you young rascals.\"\n\nThey had eaten a late but very satisfactory dinner at the\nCastello-a-Mare, where the return of the missing ones was hailed with\njoy by the proprietor and his assistants. Even the little bewhiskered\nhead-waiter, who resembled a jack-in-the-box more than he did a man,\nstrove to celebrate the occasion by putting every good thing the house\nafforded before the returned guests. For, although they dared not\ninterfere to protect the victims of the terrible Il Duca, the hotel\npeople fully recognized the fact that brigandage was not a good\nadvertisement for Taormina, and hoped the \"little incident\" would not\nbecome generally known.\n\nOld Silas Watson, dignified lawyer as he was, actually danced a hornpipe\nwhen he beheld his old friend safe and sound. But he shook his head\nreproachfully when he learned of the adventure his ward and the two\ngirls had undertaken with such temerity but marvelous success.\n\nBeth had quickly recovered from her weakness, although Kenneth had\ninsisted on keeping her arm all the way home. But the girl had been\nsilent and thoughtful, and would eat nothing at dinner.\n\nWhen they had gathered in their room to talk it all over the lawyer\nthought his young friends deserved a reproof.\n\n\"The money wasn't worth the risk, you crazy lunatics!\" he said.\n\n\"It wasn't the money at all,\" replied Patsy, demurely.\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"It was the principle of the thing. And wasn't Beth just wonderful,\nthough?\"\n\n\"Shucks!\" said Kenneth. \"She had to go and faint, like a ninny, and she\ncried all the way home, because she had hurt the brigand's finger.\"\n\nThe girl's eyes were still red, but she answered the boy's scornful\nremark by saying, gravely:\n\n\"I am sorry it had to be done. I'll never touch a revolver again as long\nas I live.\"\n\nUncle John gathered his brave niece into an ample embrace.\n\n\"I'm very proud of you, my dear,\" he said, stroking her hair lovingly,\n\"and you mustn't pay any attention to that silly boy. I've always known\nyou were true blue, Beth, and now you have proved it to everyone. It may\nhave been a reckless thing to do, as Mr. Watson says, but you did it\nlike a major, and saved our self-esteem as well as our money.\"\n\n\"Hurrah for Beth!\" yelled the boy, changing his colors without a blush.\n\n\"If you don't shut up, I'll box your ears,\" said his guardian, sternly.\n\nUncle John and young Ferralti were the heroes of the evening. The little\nold gentleman smoked a big cigar and beamed upon his nieces and friends\nwith intense satisfaction, while Ferralti sat glum and silent beside\nLouise until an abrupt challenge from Mr. Merrick effectually aroused\nhim.\n\n\"I've only one fault to find with this young man,\" was the observation\nreferred to: \"that he made our acquaintance under false pretenses. When\na fairly decent fellow becomes an impostor there is usually reason for\nit, and I would like Count Ferralti--or whatever his name is--to give us\nthat reason and make a clean breast of his deception.\"\n\nFerralti bowed, with a serious face, but looked significantly toward the\nother members of the company.\n\n\"Whatever you have to say should be heard by all,\" declared Uncle John,\nanswering the look.\n\n\"Perhaps you are right, Mr. Merrick, and all present are entitled to an\nexplanation,\" answered the young man, slowly. \"I may have been foolish,\nbut I believe I have done nothing that I need be ashamed of.\nFortunately, there is now no further reason for concealment on my part,\nand in listening to my explanation I hope you will be as considerate as\npossible.\"\n\nThey were attentive enough, by this time, and every eye was turned, not\nunkindly, upon the youth who had so long been an enigma to them\nall--except, perhaps, to Louise.\n\n\"I am an American by birth, and my name is Arthur Weldon.\"\n\nIn the pause that followed Uncle John gave a soft whistle and Patsy\nlaughed outright, to the undisguised indignation of Louise.\n\n\"Years ago,\" resumed the youth, \"my father, who was a rich man, made a\ntrip to Sicily and, although I did not know this until recently, was\nseized by brigands and imprisoned in the hidden valley we have just\nleft. There he fell in love with a beautiful girl who was the daughter\nof the female brigand known as the Duchess of Alcanta, and who assisted\nhim to escape and then married him. It was a pretty romance at the time,\nbut when my father had taken his bride home to New York and became\nimmersed in the details of his business, his love grew cold and he began\nto neglect his wife cruelly. He became a railway president and amassed\na great fortune, but was not so successful a husband as he was a\nfinancier. The result was that the Sicilian girl, after some years of\nunhappiness and suffering, deserted him and returned to her own country,\nleaving her child, then three years old, behind her. To be frank with\nyou, it was said at the time that my mother's mind had become\nunbalanced, or she would not have abandoned me to the care of a loveless\nfather, but I prefer to think that she had come to hate her husband so\nbitterly that she could have no love for his child or else she feared\nthat her terrible mother would kill me if I came into her power. Her\nflight mattered little to my father, except that it made him more stern\nand tyrannical toward me. He saw me very seldom and confided my\neducation to servants. So I grew up practically unloved and uncared for,\nand when the proper time arrived I was sent to college. My father now\ngave me an ample allowance, and at the close of my college career called\nme into his office and ordered me to enter the employ of the railway\ncompany. I objected to this. I did not like the business and had other\nplans for my future. But he was stubborn and dictatorial, and when I\ncontinued unsubmissive he threatened to cast me off entirely and leave\nhis fortune to charity, since he had no other near relatives. He must\nhave thought better of this decision afterward, for he gave me a year to\ndecide whether or not I would obey him. At the end of that time, he\ndeclared, I would become either a pauper or his heir, at my option.\n\n\"It was during this year that I formed the acquaintance of your niece,\nMiss Merrick, and grew to love her devotedly. Louise returned my\naffection, but her mother, learning of my quarrel with my father,\nrefused to sanction our engagement until I was acknowledged his heir. I\nwas forbidden her house, but naturally we met elsewhere, and when I knew\nshe was going to Europe with you, sir, who had never seen me, we hit\nupon what we thought was a happy and innocent plan to avoid the long\nseparation. I decided to go to Europe also, and without you or your\nother nieces suspecting, my identity, attach myself to your party and\nenjoy the society of Louise while she remained abroad. So I followed\nyou on the next ship and met you at Sorrento, where I introduced myself\nas Count Ferralti--a name we had agreed I should assume before we parted\nin America.\n\n\"The rest of my story you know. My father was killed in an accident on\nhis own railroad, and I received the news while we were prisoners of the\nbrigand, whom I discovered to be my uncle, but who had no mercy upon me\nbecause of the relationship. To-night, on my return here, I found a\nletter from my father's attorney, forwarded from my bankers in Paris.\nThrough my father's sudden death I have inherited all his wealth, as he\nhad no time to alter his will. Therefore Mrs. Merrick's objection to me\nis now removed, and Louise has never cared whether I had a penny or\nnot.\"\n\nHe halted, as if not knowing what more to say, and the little group of\nlisteners remained quiet because it seemed that no remark from them was\nnecessary. Young Weldon, however, was ill at ease, and after hitching\nnervously in his chair he addressed Uncle John in these words:\n\n\"Sir, you are the young lady's guardian for the present, as she is in\nyour charge. I therefore ask your consent to our formal engagement.\"\n\n\"Not any,\" said Uncle John, decidedly. \"I'll sanction no engagement of\nany children on this trip. You are wrong in supposing I am Louise's\nguardian--I'm just her chum and uncle. It's like cradle-snatching to\nwant to marry a girl of sixteen, and you ought to be ashamed of\nyourself, for you can't be much more than twenty-one yourself. While\nLouise is in my care I won't have any entanglements of any sort, so\nyou'll have to wait till you get home and settle the business with her\nmother.\"\n\n\"Very wise and proper, sir,\" said Mr. Watson, nodding gravely.\n\nLouise's cheeks were flaming.\n\n\"Do you intend to drive Arthur away, Uncle?\" she asked.\n\n\"Why should I, my dear? except that you've both taken me for a blind old\nidiot and tried to deceive me. Let the boy stay with us, if he wants\nto, but he'll have to cut out all love-making and double-dealing from\nthis time on--or I'll take you home in double-quick time.\"\n\nThe young man seemed to resent the indictment.\n\n\"The deception seemed necessary at the time, sir,\" he said, \"and you\nmust not forget the old adage that 'all's fair in love and war.' But I\nbeg that you will forgive us both and overlook our fault, if fault it\nwas. Hereafter it is our desire to be perfectly frank with you in all\nthings.\"\n\nThat was a good way to disarm Uncle John's anger, and the result was\nimmediately apparent.\n\n\"Very good,\" said the old gentleman; \"if you are proper and obedient\nchildren I've no objection to your being together. I rather like you,\nArthur Weldon, and most of your failings are due to the foolishness of\nyouth. But you've got to acquire dignity now, for you have suddenly\nbecome a man of consequence in the world. Don't think you've got to\nmarry every girl that attracts you by her pretty face. This devotion to\nLouise may be 'puppy-love,' after all, and--\"\n\n\"Oh, Uncle!\" came a chorus of protest.\n\n\"What, you rascals! are you encouraging this desperate fol-de-rol?\"\n\n\"You are too severe, Uncle John,\" said Patsy, smiling. \"The trouble with\nyou is that you've never been in love yourself.\"\n\n\"Never been in love!\" He beamed upon the three girls with devotion\nwritten all over his round, jolly face.\n\n\"Then you're jealous,\" said Kenneth. \"Give the poor kids a fair show,\nUncle John.\"\n\n\"All right, I will. Arthur, my lad, join our happy family as one of my\nkidlets, and love us all--but no one in particular. Eh? Until we get\nhome again, you know. We've started out to have the time of our lives,\nand we're getting it in chunks--eh, girls?\"\n\n\"We certainly are, Uncle John!\" Another chorus.\n\n\"Well, what do you say, Arthur Weldon?\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are right, sir,\" answered the young man. \"And, anyway, I am\ndeeply grateful for your kindness. I fear I must return home in a couple\nof weeks, to look after business matters; but while I remain with you I\nshall try to conduct myself as you wish.\"\n\n\"That sounds proper. Is it satisfactory to you, Louise?\"\n\n\"Yes, Uncle.\"\n\n\"Then we've settled Cupid--for a time, anyway. And now, my dears, I\nthink we have all had enough of Taormina. Where shall we go next?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nTATO IS ADOPTED\n\n\nThey canvassed the subject of their future travels with considerable\nearnestness. Uncle John was bent upon getting to Rome and Venice, and\nfrom there to Paris, and the nieces were willing to go anywhere he\npreferred, as they were sure to enjoy every day of their trip in the old\nworld. But Mr. Watson urged them strongly to visit Syracuse, since they\nwere not likely to return to Sicily again and the most famous of all the\nancient historic capitals was only a few hours' journey from Taormina.\nSo it was finally decided to pass a week in Syracuse before returning to\nthe continent, and preparations were at once begun for their departure.\n\nKenneth pleaded for one more day in which to finish his picture of Etna,\nand this was allowed him. Uncle John nevertheless confessed to being\nuneasy as long as they remained on the scene of his recent exciting\nexperiences. Mr. Watson advised them all not to stray far from the\nhotel, as there was no certainty that Il Duca would not make another\nattempt to entrap them, or at least to be revenged for their escape from\nhis clutches.\n\nOn the afternoon of the next day, however, they were startled by a call\nfrom the Duke in person. He was dressed in his usual faded velvet\ncostume and came to them leading by the hand a beautiful little girl.\n\nThe nieces gazed at the child in astonishment.\n\nTato wore a gray cloth gown, ill-fitting and of coarse material; but no\ncostume could destroy the fairy-like perfection of her form or the\ndaintiness of her exquisite features. With downcast eyes and a troubled\nexpression she stood modestly before them until Patsy caught her\nrapturously in her arms and covered her face with kisses.\n\n\"You lovely, lovely thing!\" she cried. \"I'm _so_ glad to see you again,\nTato darling!\"\n\nThe Duke's stern features softened. He sighed heavily and accepted\nUncle John's polite invitation to be seated.\n\nThe little party of Americans was fairly astounded by this unexpected\nvisit. Kenneth regretted that he had left his revolver upstairs, but the\nothers remembered that the brigand would not dare to molest them in the\nsecurity of the hotel grounds, and were more curious than afraid.\n\nIl Duca's hand was wrapped in a bandage, but the damaged finger did not\nseem to affect him seriously. Beth could not take her eyes off this\ndreadful evidence of her late conflict, and stared at it as if the\nbandage fascinated her.\n\n\"Signore,\" said the Duke, addressing Uncle John especially, \"I owe to\nyou my apologies and my excuses for the annoyance I have caused to you\nand your friends. I have the explanation, if you will so kindly permit\nme.\"\n\n\"Fire away, Duke,\" was the response.\n\n\"Signore, I unfortunately come of a race of brigands. For centuries my\nfamily has been lawless and it was natural that by education I, too,\nshould become a brigand. In my youth my father was killed in an affray\nand my mother took his place, seizing many prisoners and exacting from\nthem ransom. My mother you have seen, and you know of her sudden madness\nand of her death. She was always mad, I think, and by nature a fiend.\nShe urged my elder brother to wicked crimes, and when he rebelled she\nherself cast him, in a fit of anger, into the pit. I became duke in his\nplace, and did my mother's bidding because I feared to oppose her. But\nfor years I have longed to abandon the life and have done with crime.\n\n\"With me our race ends, for I have no sons. But my one child, whom you\nknow as Tato, I love dearly. My greatest wish is to see her happy. The\nlast few days have changed the fortunes of us both. The Duchessa is\ngone, and at last I am the master of my own fate. As for Tato, she has\nbeen charmed by the young American signorini, and longs to be like them.\nSo we come to ask that you forgive the wrong we did you, and that you\nwill now allow us to be your friends.\"\n\nUncle John was amazed.\n\n\"You have decided to reform, Duke?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, signore. Not alone for Tato's sake, but because I loathe the life\nof brigandage. See; here is my thought. At once I will disband my men\nand send them away. My household effects I will sell, and then abandon\nthe valley forever. Tato and I have some money, enough to live in quiet\nin some other land, where we shall be unknown.\"\n\n\"A very good idea, Duke.\"\n\n\"But from my respect for you, Signer Merreek, and from my daughter's\nlove for your nieces--the brave and beautiful signorini--I shall dare to\nask from you a favor. But already I am aware that we do not deserve it.\"\n\n\"What is it, sir?\"\n\n\"That you take my Tato to keep for a few weeks, until I can send away my\nmen and arrange my affairs here. It would be unpleasant for the child\nhere, and with you she will be so happy. I would like the sweet\nsignorini to buy nice dresses, like those they themselves wear, for my\nlittle girl, and to teach her the good manners she could not gain as\nthe brigand's daughter. Tato has the money to pay for everything but the\nkindness, if you will let her stay in your society until I can claim\nher. I am aware that I ask too much; but the Signorina Patsy has said to\nmy child that they would always be friends, whatever might happen, and\nas I know you to be generous I have dared to come to you with this\nrequest. I only ask your friendship for my Tato, who is innocent. For\nmyself, after I have become a good man, then perhaps you will forgive\nme, too.\"\n\nUncle John looked thoughtful; the old lawyer was grave and listened\nsilently. Patsy, her arms still around the shrinking form of the child,\nlooked pleadingly at her uncle. Beth's eyes were moist and Louise smiled\nencouragingly.\n\n\"Well, my dears? The Duke is certainly not entitled to our friendship,\nas he truly says; but I have nothing against little Tato. What do you\nadvise?\"\n\n\"Let us keep her, and dress her like the beautiful doll she is, and love\nher!\" cried Patsy.\n\n\"She shall be our adopted cousin,\" said Louise.\n\n\"Tato is good stuff!\" declared Kenneth.\n\n\"Well, Beth?\"\n\n\"It seems to me, Uncle,\" said the girl, seriously, \"that if the Duke\nreally wishes to reform, we should give him a helping hand. The little\ngirl has led a bad life only because her father forced her to lure his\nvictims and then procure the money for their ransoms; but I am sure her\nnature is sweet and pure, and she is so young that she will soon forget\nthe evil things she has learned. So I vote with my cousins. Let us adopt\nTato, and care for her until her father can introduce her into a new and\nmore proper life.\"\n\n\"Well argued, Beth,\" said Uncle John, approvingly. \"I couldn't have put\nthe case better myself. What do you say, Silas Watson?\"\n\n\"That you are all quite right,\" answered the old lawyer. \"And the best\npart of the whole thing, to me, is the fact that this nest of brigands\nwill be wiped out of existence, and Taormina be hereafter as safe for\ntourists as old Elmhurst itself. I wish I could say as much for the rest\nof Sicily.\"\n\nUncle John extended his hand to the Duke, who took it gratefully,\nalthough with a shamefaced expression that was perhaps natural under the\ncircumstances.\n\n\"Look up, dear,\" said Patsy to the girl, softly; \"look up and kiss me.\nYou've been adopted, Tato! Are you glad?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nDREAMS AND DRESS-MAKING\n\n\nTato was now one of the family. They left Taormina the next day, and\nFrascatti drove all the girls in his victoria to the station.\n\n\"You must come again, signorini,\" said he, looking regretful at their\ndeparture. \"Next year the fountain of the ice cream soda will be in\noperation, like those you have in Chicago, which is America. Our culture\nincreases with our civilization. It is even hinted that Il Duca is to\nabandon our island forever. He has been interesting to us, but not\npopular, and you will not miss him when you come again to find he is not\nhere. If this time he has caused you an inconvenience, I am sorry. It is\nregrettable, but,--\"\n\n\"But it is so!\" said Patsy, laughing.\n\nTato was again transformed. Patricia, who was the smallest of the three\nnieces, though not especially slim, had quickly altered one of her own\npretty white gowns to fit the child, and as she was deft with her needle\nand the others had enthusiastically assisted her, Tato now looked more\nlike a fairy than ever.\n\nIt was really wonderful what a suitable dress could do for the tiny\nSicilian maid. She had lost her free and boyish manner and become shy\nand retiring with strangers, although when in the society of the three\nnieces she was as sweet and frank as ever. She wore her new gown\ngracefully, too, as if well accustomed to feminine attire all her life.\nThe only thing now needed, as Patsy said, was time in which to grow her\nhair, which had always been cut short, in boyish fashion.\n\nThey were a merry party when they boarded the train for Syracuse, and\nUncle John arranged with the guard to secure two adjoining compartments\nall to themselves, that they might have plenty of room.\n\n\"Where did you put the money, Uncle John?\" Beth whispered, when at last\nthey were whirling along and skirting the base of Mt. Etna toward the\nCatania side.\n\n\"I've hidden it in my trunk,\" he replied, in the same confidential tone.\n\"There is no bank in this neighborhood to receive it, so I decided to\ncarry it with us.\"\n\n\"But will it be safe in the trunk?\" she enquired.\n\n\"Of course, my dear. Who would think of looking there for fifty thousand\ndollars? And no one knows we happen to have so much money with us.\"\n\n\"What did the Count--I mean, Mr. Weldon--do with his ransom?\"\n\n\"Carries it in his satchel, so he can keep it with him and have an eye\non it. It's a great mistake, Beth, to do such a thing as that. It'll\nmake him uneasy every minute, and he won't dare to let a _facchino_\nhandle his grip. But in my case, on the other hand, I know it's\nsomewhere in the baggage car, so I don't have to worry.\"\n\nThe journey was a delightful one. The road skirted the coast through the\noldest and most picturesque part of Sicily, and it amazed them to\nobserve that however far they travelled Etna was always apparently next\ndoor, and within reaching distance.\n\nAt Aci Castello they were pointed out the seven Isles of the Cyclops,\nwhich the blind Polyphemus once hurled after the crafty Ulysses. Then\nthey came to Catania, which is the second largest city in Sicily, but\nhas little of historic interest. Here they were really at the nearest\npoint to the mighty volcano, but did not realize it because it always\nseemed to be near them. Eighteen miles farther they passed Leontinoi,\nwhich in ancient days dared to rival Siracusa itself, and an hour later\nthe train skirted the bay and Capo Santa Panagia and slowly came to a\nhalt in that city which for centuries dominated all the known world and\nwas more powerful and magnificent in its prime than Athens\nitself--Syracuse.\n\nThe day had become cloudy and gray and the wind whistled around them\nwith a chill sweep as they left their coach at the station and waited\nfor Kenneth to find carriages. Afterward they had a mile to drive to\ntheir hotel; for instead of stopping in the modern town Uncle John had\ntelegraphed for rooms at the Villa Politi, which is located in the\nancient Achradina, at the edge of the Latomia de Cappuccini. By the time\nthey arrived there they were blue with cold, and were glad to seek the\nwarm rooms prepared for them and pass the remainder of the afternoon\nunpacking and \"getting settled.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" said Patsy, dolefully, \"that we shall miss the bright\nsunshine and warmth of Taormina, Tato.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is not always warm there, nor is it always cold here,\" replied\nthe child. \"Indeed, signorina, I have heard that the climate of Siracusa\nis very delightful.\"\n\n\"It doesn't look it,\" returned Patsy; \"but it may improve.\"\n\nThe interior of the hotel was comfortable, though, however bleak the\nweather might be outside. A good dinner put them all in a better humor\nand they passed the evening watching the strangers assembled in the\nparlors and wondering where they had come from and who they were.\n\n\"That money,\" whispered Uncle John to Beth, as he kissed her good\nnight, \"is still as safe as can be. I've lost the key to my trunk, and\nnow I can't even get at it myself.\"\n\n\"Lost it!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes; but that won't matter. It's the big trunk that holds the things I\ndon't often use, and if I can't unlock it no one else can, that's\ncertain. So I shall rest easy until I need something out of it, and then\nI'll get a locksmith to pick the lock.\"\n\n\"But I wish you hadn't lost the key,\" said the girl, thoughtfully.\n\n\"Strikes me it's good luck. Pleasant dreams, my dear. I can fancy Arthur\nWeldon lying awake all night with his dreadful thirty thousand tucked\nunder his pillow. It's a great mistake to carry so much money with you,\nBeth, for you're sure to worry about it.\"\n\nThe next morning when they came down to breakfast they were all amazed\nat the gorgeous sunshine and the genial temperature that had followed\nthe dreary afternoon of their arrival. Syracuse was transformed, and\nfrom every window of the hotel the brilliant glow of countless flowers\ninvited one to wander in the gardens, which are surpassed by few if any\nin the known world.\n\nThe Villa Politi stood so near the edge of a monstrous quarry that it\nseemed as if it might topple into the abyss at any moment. Our friends\nwere on historic ground, indeed, for these quarries--or latomia, as they\nare called--supplied all the stone of which the five cities of ancient\nSyracuse were built--cities which in our age have nearly, if not quite,\npassed out of existence. The walls of the quarry are a hundred feet in\ndepth, and at the bottom are now acres upon acres of the most delightful\ngardens, whose luxuriance is attributable to the fact that they are\nshielded from the winds while the sun reaches them nearly all the day.\nThere are gardens on the level above, and beautiful ones, too; but these\nin the deep latomia are the most fascinating.\n\nThe girls could scarcely wait to finish breakfast before rushing out to\ndescend the flights of iron steps that lead to the bottom of the vast\nexcavation. And presently they were standing on the ground below and\nlooking up at the vine covered cliffs that shut out all of the upper\nworld.\n\nIt was peaceful here, and soothing to tired nerves. Through blooming\nshrubbery and along quiet paths they might wander for hours, and at\nevery step find something new to marvel at and to delight the senses.\n\nHere were ancient tombs cut from the solid rock--one of them that of an\nAmerican midshipman who died in Syracuse and selected this impressive\nand lovely vault for his burial place. And there stood the famous statue\nof Archimedes, who used in life to wander in this very latomia.\n\n\"Once,\" said Mr. Watson, musingly, \"there were seven thousand Athenian\nprisoners confined in this very place, and allowed to perish through\nstarvation and disease. The citizens of Syracuse--even the fine ladies\nand the little children--used to stand on the heights above and mock at\nthe victims of their king's cruelty.\"\n\n\"Couldn't they climb out?\" asked Patsy, shuddering at the thought that\nsome of the poor prisoners might have died on the very spot her feet\nnow trod.\n\n\"No, dear. And it is said the guards constantly patrolled the edge to\nslay any who might venture to make the attempt.\"\n\n\"Wasn't it dreadful!\" she exclaimed. \"But I'm glad they have made a\nflower garden of it now. Somehow, it reminds me of a cemetery.\"\n\nBut there were other interesting sights to be seen at Syracuse, and they\nlaid out a systematic programme of the places they would visit each\nmorning while they remained there. The afternoons were supposed to be\nreserved for rest, but the girls were so eager to supply Tato with a\nfitting wardrobe that they at once began to devote the afternoons to\nshopping and dress-making.\n\nThe child had placed in Uncle John's keeping a liberally supplied purse,\nwhich the Duke wished to be applied to the purchase of whatever his\ndaughter might need or desire.\n\n\"He wants me to dress as you do,\" said Tato, simply; \"and because you\nwill know what is fitting my station and will be required in my future\nlife, he has burdened you with my society. It was selfish in my father,\nwas it not? But but--I wanted so much to be with you--because you are\ngood to me!\"\n\n\"And we're mighty glad to have you with us,\" answered Patsy. \"It's no\nend of fun getting a girl a whole new outfit, from top to toe; and,\naside from that, we already love you as if you were our little sister.\"\n\nBeth and Louise equally endorsed this statement; and indeed the child\nwas so sweet and pretty and so grateful for the least kindness bestowed\nupon her that it was a pleasure to assist and counsel her.\n\nTato looked even smaller in girls' clothing than in boys', and she\nimproved so rapidly in her manners by constantly watching the nieces\nthat it was hard to imagine she had until now been all unused to polite\nsociety. Already they began to dread the day when her father would come\nto claim her, and the girls and Uncle John had conceived a clever plan\nto induce the Duke to let his daughter travel with them on the continent\nand then go for a brief visit to them in America.\n\n\"By that time,\" declared Louise, \"Tato's education will be\naccomplished, and she will be as refined and ladylike as any girl of her\nage we know. Blood will tell, they say, and the monk who taught her must\nhave been an intelligent and careful man.\"\n\n\"She knows more of history and languages than all the rest of us put\ntogether,\" added Beth.\n\n\"And, having adopted her, we mustn't do the thing by halves,\" concluded\nPatsy; \"so our darling little brigandess must tease her papa to let her\nstay with us as long as possible.\"\n\nTato smiled and blushed with pleasure. It was very delightful to know\nshe had such enthusiastic friends. But she was afraid the Duke would not\nlike to spare her for so long a time as a visit to America would\nrequire.\n\n\"You leave him to me,\" said Uncle John. \"I'll argue the case clearly and\nlogically, and after that he will have to cave in gracefully.\"\n\nMeantime the dainty gowns and pretty costumes were one by one finished\nand sent to the hotel, and the girls ransacked the rather inadequate\nshops of Syracuse for the smartest things in lingerie that could be\nprocured. As they were determined to \"try everything on\" and see how\ntheir prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 looked in her finery, Tato was now obliged to dress for\ndinner and on every other possible occasion, and she not only astonished\nher friends by her loveliness but drew the eye of every stranger as\nsurely as the magnet attracts the needle.\n\nEven in Sicily, where the Greek type of beauty to-day exists more\nperfectly than in Helene, there were few to compare with Tato, and it\nwas only natural that the Americans should be very proud of her.\n\nKenneth was sketching a bit of the quarry and the old monastery beyond\nit, with the blue sea glimmering in the distance. Sometimes he would\njoin the others in their morning trips to the catacombs, the cathedrals\nor the museum; but the afternoons he devoted to his picture, and the\nothers came to the gardens with him and sat themselves down to sew or\nread beside his easel.\n\nArthur Weldon was behaving very well indeed; and although a good deal of\nthe credit belonged to Louise, who managed him with rare diplomatic\nability, Uncle John grew to like the young man better each day, and had\nno fault whatever to find with him.\n\nHe was still rather silent and reserved; but that seemed a part of his\nnature, inherited doubtless from his father, and when he chose to talk\nhis conversation was interesting and agreeable.\n\nKenneth claimed that Arthur had a bad habit of \"making goo-goo eyes\" at\nLouise; but the young man's manner was always courteous and judicious\nwhen addressing her, and he managed to conceal his love with admirable\ndiscretion--at least when others were present.\n\nUncle John's private opinion, confided in secret to his friend Mr.\nWatson, was that Louise \"really might do worse; that is, if they were\nboth of the same mind when they grew up.\"\n\nAnd so the days passed pleasantly away, and the time for their departure\nfrom Syracuse drew near.\n\nOn the last morning all of them--with the exception of Tato, who pleaded\na headache--drove to the Latomia del Paradiso to see the celebrated \"Ear\nof Dionysius\"--that vast cavern through which the tyrant is said to\nhave overheard every whisper uttered by the prisoners who were confined\nin that quarry. There is a little room at the top of the cliff, also\nbuilt from the rock, where it is claimed Dionysius sat and played\neavesdropper; and it is true that one in that place can hear the\nslightest sound uttered in the chamber below.\n\nAfterward the amphitheatre and the ancient street of the tombs were paid\na final visit, with a stop at San Giovanni, where St. Paul once\npreached. And at noon the tourists returned to the hotel hungry but\nenthusiastic, in time for the table-d'-hote luncheon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nTATO WINS\n\n\n\"This is funny!\" cried Patsy, appearing before Uncle John with a white\nand startled face. \"I can't find Tato anywhere.\"\n\n\"And her new trunk is gone from her room, as well as her gowns and\neverything she owns,\" continued Beth's clear voice, over her cousin's\nshoulder.\n\nUncle John stared at them bewildered. Then an expression of anxiety\ncrept over his kindly face.\n\n\"Are you sure?\" he asked.\n\n\"There can't be a mistake, Uncle. She's just _gone_.\"\n\n\"None of you has offended, or annoyed the child, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Uncle. She kissed us all very sweetly when we left her this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"I can't understand it.\"\n\n\"Nor can we.\"\n\n\"Could her father have come for her, do you think?\" suggested Mr.\nMerrick, after a moment's thought.\n\n\"I can't imagine her so ungrateful as to leave us without a word,\" said\nPatsy. \"I know Tato well, Uncle, and the dear child would not hurt our\nfeelings for the world. She loves us dearly.\"\n\n\"But she's a queer thing,\" added Louise, \"and I don't trust her\naltogether. Sometimes I've surprised a look in her eyes that wasn't as\ninnocent and demure as she would have us imagine her.\"\n\n\"Oh, Louise!\"\n\n\"And there's another reason.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"She reformed too suddenly.\"\n\nUncle John slapped his forehead a mighty blow as a suspicious and\ndreadful thought flashed across his mind. But next instant he drew a\nlong breath and smiled again.\n\n\"It was lucky I lost that key to the trunk,\" he observed, still a little\nashamed of his temporary lack of confidence in Tato. \"It's been locked\never since we left Taormina, so the child couldn't be tempted by that.\"\n\n\"She wouldn't touch your money for the world!\" said Patsy, indignantly.\n\"Tato is no thief!\"\n\n\"She comes of a race of thieves, though,\" Beth reminded her.\n\n\"I wonder if Arthur's money is still safe,\" remarked Louise, following\nthe line of thought suggested.\n\nAs if with one accord they moved down the hall to the door of the young\nman's room.\n\n\"Are you in, Arthur?\" asked Uncle John, knocking briskly.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nHe opened his door at once, and saw with surprise the little group of\nanxious faces outside.\n\n\"Is your money safe?\" asked Uncle John.\n\nWeldon gave them a startled glance and then ran to his dresser and\npulled open a drawer. After a moment's fumbling he turned with a smile.\n\n\"All safe, sir.\"\n\nUncle John and his nieces were visibly relieved.\n\n\"You see,\" continued Arthur, \"I've invented a clever hiding-place,\nbecause the satchel could not be left alone and I didn't wish to lug it\nwith me every step I took. So I placed the packages of bills inside the\nleg of a pair of trousers, and put them in a drawer with some other\nclothing at top and bottom. A dozen people might rummage in that drawer\nwithout suspecting the fact that money is hidden there. I've come to\nbelieve the place is as good as a bank; but you startled me for a\nminute, with your question. What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Tato's gone.\"\n\n\"Gone!\"\n\n\"Departed bag and baggage.\"\n\n\"But your fifty thousand, sir. Is it safe?\"\n\n\"It has to be,\" answered Uncle John. \"It is in a steel-bound,\ndouble-locked trunk, to which I've lost the key. No bank can beat that,\nmy boy.\"\n\n\"Then why did the child run away?\"\n\nThey could not answer that.\n\n\"It's a mystery,\" said Patsy, almost ready to weep. \"But I'll bet it's\nthat cruel, wicked father of hers. Perhaps he came while we were out and\nwouldn't wait a minute.\"\n\n\"What does the hall porter say?\" asked Kenneth, who had joined the group\nin time to overhear the last speech and guess what had happened.\n\n\"Stupid!\" cried Uncle John. \"We never thought of the hall-porter. Come\nback to our sitting room, and we'll have him up in a jiffy.\"\n\nThe portiere answered his bell with alacrity. The Americans were liberal\nguests.\n\nThe young lady? Ah, she had driven away soon after they had themselves\ngone. A thin-faced, dark-eyed man had called for her and taken her away,\nplacing her baggage on the box of the carriage. Yes, she had paid her\nbill and tipped the servants liberally.\n\n\"Just as I suspected!\" cried Patsy. \"That horrid duke has forced her to\nleave us. Perhaps he was jealous, and feared we would want to keep her\nalways. Was she weeping and miserable, porter?\"\n\n\"No, signorina. She laughed and was very merry. And--but I had\nforgotten! There is a letter which she left for the Signorina D'Oyle.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"In the office. I will bring it at once.\"\n\nHe ran away and quickly returned, placing a rather bulky parcel in the\ngirl's hands.\n\n\"You read it, Uncle John,\" she said. \"There can't be anything private in\nTato's letter, and perhaps she has explained everything.\"\n\nHe put on his glasses and then took the missive and deliberately opened\nit. Tato wrote a fine, delicate hand, and although the English words\nwere badly spelled she expressed herself quite well in the foreign\ntongue. With the spelling and lack of punctuation corrected, her letter\nwas as follows:\n\n\"Dear, innocent, foolish Patsy: How astonished you will be to find I\nhave vanished from your life forever; and what angry and indignant words\nyou will hurl after poor Tato! But they will not reach me, because you\nwill not know in which direction to send them, and I will not care\nwhether you are angry or not.\n\n\"You have been good to me, Patsy, and I really love you--fully as much\nas I have fear of that shrewd and pretty cousin of yours, whose cold\neyes have made me tremble more than once. But tell Beth I forgive her,\nbecause she is the only clever one of the lot of you. Louise thinks she\nis clever, but her actions remind me of the juggler who explained his\ntricks before he did them, so that the audience would know how skillful\nhe was.\"\n\n\"But oh, Patsy, what simpletons you all are! And because you have been\ntoo stupid to guess the truth I must bother to write it all down. For it\nwould spoil much of my satisfaction and enjoyment if you did not know\nhow completely I have fooled you.\n\n\"You tricked us that day in the mountain glen, and for the first time an\nAlcanta brigand lost his prisoners and his ransom money through being\noutwitted. But did you think that was the end? If so you failed to\nappreciate us.\n\n\"Look you, my dear, we could have done without the money, for our family\nhas been robbing and accumulating for ages, with little need to expend\nmuch from year to year. It is all in the Bank of Italy, too, and drawing\nthe interest, for my father is a wise man of business. That four hundred\nthousand lira was to have been our last ransom, and after we had fairly\nearned it you tricked us and did not pay.\n\n\"So my father and I determined to get even with you, as much through\nrevenge as cupidity. We were obliged to desert the valley at once,\nbecause we were getting so rich that the government officials became\nuneasy and warned us to go or be arrested. So we consulted together and\ndecided upon our little plot, which was so simple that it has worked\nperfectly. We came to you with our sad story, and you thought we had\nreformed, and kindly adopted me as one of your party. It was so easy\nthat I almost laughed in your foolish faces. But I didn't, for I can\nact. I played the child very nicely, I think, and you quite forgot I was\na brigand's daughter, with the wild, free blood of many brave outlaws\ncoursing in my veins. Ah, I am more proud of that than of my acting.\n\n\"Innocent as I seemed, I watched you all carefully, and knew from\nalmost the first hour where the money had been put. I stole the key to\nUncle John's trunk on the train, while we were going from Taormina to\nSyracuse; but I did not take the money from it because I had no better\nplace to keep it, and the only danger was that he would force the lock\nsome day. But Ferralti's money--I call him Ferralti because it is a\nprettier name than Weldon--bothered me for a long time. At the first he\nwould not let that little satchel out of his sight, and when he finally\ndid he had removed the money to some other place. I searched his room\nmany times, but could not find his hiding place until last night. While\nhe was at dinner I discovered the bills in one of the drawers of his\ndresser.\n\n\"But for this difficulty I should have left your charming society\nbefore, as my father has been secretly waiting for me for three days.\nHaving located Ferralti's money I waited until this morning and when you\nhad all left me I signalled to my father from my window and prepared to\ndisappear. It took but a few minutes to get the money from Uncle John's\ntrunk and Arthur's trouser-leg. Much obliged for it, I'm sure. Then I\npacked up all my pretty dresses in my new trunk--for part of our plot\nwas to use your good taste in fitting me out properly--and now I am\nwriting this loving epistle before I leave.\n\n\"We shall go to Paris or Vienna or Cairo or London--guess which! We\nshall have other names--very beautiful ones--and be rich and dignified\nand respected. When I grow older I think I shall marry a prince and\nbecome a princess; but that will not interest you much, for you will not\nknow that the great princess is your own little Tato.\n\n\"Tell Uncle John I have left the key to his trunk on the mantel, behind\nthe picture of the madonna. I stuffed papers into Arthur's trouser leg\nto deceive him if he came back before I had a chance to escape. But I\nhoped you would discover nothing until you read this letter, for I\nwanted to surprise you. Have I? Then I am content. You tricked me once;\nbut I have tricked you at the last, and the final triumph is mine.\n\n\"In spite of all, Patsy dear, I love you; for you are sweet and good,\nand although I would not be like you for the world I can appreciate your\nexcellent qualities. Remember this when your anger is gone. I won't be\nable to visit you in America, but I shall always think of you in a more\nkindly way than I fear you will think of the Sicilian tomboy, TATO.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nA WAY TO FORGET\n\n\nThe faces of the group, as Uncle John finished reading, were worth\nstudying. Arthur Weldon was white with anger, and his eyes blazed. Silas\nWatson stared blankly at his old friend, wondering if it was because he\nwas growing old that he had been so easily hoodwinked by this saucy\nchild. Beth was biting her lip to keep back the tears of humiliation\nthat longed to trickle down her cheeks. Louise frowned because she\nremembered the hard things Tato had said of her. Patsy was softly crying\nat the loss of her friend.\n\nThen Kenneth laughed, and the sound sent a nervous shiver through the\ngroup.\n\n\"Tato's a brick!\" announced the boy, audaciously. \"Can't you see, you\nstupids, that the thing is a good joke on us all? Or are you too thin\nskinned to laugh at your own expense?\"\n\n\"Oh, we can laugh,\" responded Uncle John, gravely. \"But if Tato's a\nbrick it's because she is hard and insensible. The loss of the money\ndoesn't hurt me, but to think the wicked little lass made me love her\nwhen she didn't deserve it is the hardest blow I have ever received.\"\n\nThat made Patsy sob outright, while Louise ejaculated, with scorn: \"The\nlittle wretch!\"\n\n\"It serves us right for having confidence in a child reared to crime and\nmurder from the cradle,\" said Arthur, rather savagely. \"I don't know how\nmuch money I am worth, but I'd gladly spend another thirty thousand to\nbring this wretched creature to justice.\"\n\n\"Money won't do it,\" declared the lawyer, shaking his head regretfully.\n\"The rascals are too clever to be caught in Europe. It would be\ndifferent at home.\"\n\n\"Well, the best thing to do is to grin and bear it, and forget the\nunpleasant incident as soon as possible,\" said Uncle John. \"I feel as if\nI'd had my pocket picked by my best friend, but it isn't nearly as\ndisgraceful as being obliged to assist the thief by paying ransom\nmoney. The loss amounts to nothing to either of us, and such treachery,\nthank goodness, is rare in the world. We can't afford to let the thing\nmake us unhappy, my friends; so cheer up, all of you, and don't dwell\nupon it any more than you can help.\"\n\nThey left Syracuse a rather solemn group, in spite of this wise advice,\nand journeyed back to Naples and thence to Rome. There was much to see\nhere, and they saw it so energetically that when they boarded the train\nfor Florence they were all fagged out and could remember nothing clearly\nexcept the Coliseum and the Baths of Carracalla.\n\nFlorence was just now a bower of roses and very beautiful. But Kenneth\nlugged them to the galleries day after day until Uncle John declared he\nhated to look an \"old master\" in the face.\n\n\"After all, they're only daubs,\" he declared. \"Any ten-year-old boy in\nAmerica can paint better pictures.\"\n\n\"Don't let anyone hear you say that, dear,\" cautioned Patsy. \"They'd\nthink you don't know good art.\"\n\n\"But I do,\" he protested. \"If any of those pictures by old masters was\nused in a street-car 'ad' at home it would be money wasted, for no one\nwould look at them. The people wouldn't stand for it a minute.\"\n\n\"They are wonderful for the age in which they were painted,\" said\nKenneth, soberly. \"You must remember that we have had centuries in which\nto improve our art, since then.\"\n\n\"Oh, I've a proper respect for old age, I hope,\" replied Uncle John;\n\"but to fall down and worship a thing because it's gray-haired and\nout-of-date isn't just my style. All of these 'Oh!'s' and 'Ahs!' over\nthe old masters are rank humbug, and I'm ashamed of the people that\ndon't know better.\"\n\nAnd now Arthur Weldon was obliged to bid good-bye to Louise and her\nfriends and take a train directly to Paris to catch the steamer for\nhome. His attorney advised him that business demanded his immediate\npresence, and he was obliged to return, however reluctantly.\n\nKenneth and Mr. Watson also left the party at Florence, as the boy\nartist wished to remain there for a time to study the pictures that\nUncle John so bitterly denounced. The others went on to Venice, which\nnaturally proved to the nieces one of the most delightful places they\nhad yet seen. Mr. Merrick loved it because he could ride in a gondola\nand rest his stubby legs, which had become weary with tramping through\ngalleries and cathedrals. These last monuments, by the way, had grown to\nbecome a sort of nightmare to the little gentleman. The girls were\nenthusiastic over cathedrals, and allowed none to escape a visit. For a\ntime Uncle John had borne up bravely, but the day of rebellion was soon\ncoming.\n\n\"No cathedrals in Venice, I hope?\" he had said on their arrival.\n\n\"Oh, yes, dear; the loveliest one in the world! St. Mark's is here, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"But no St. Paul's or St. Peter's?\"\n\n\"No, Uncle. There's the Saluta, and the--\"\n\n\"Never mind. We'll do that first one, and then quit. What they build so\nmany churches for I can't imagine. Nobody goes to 'em but tourists, that\nI can see.\"\n\nHe developed a streak of extravagance in Venice, and purchased Venetian\nlace and Venetian glassware to such an extent that the nieces had to\nassure him they were all supplied with enough to last them and their\nfriends for all time to come. Major Doyle had asked for a meerschaum\npipe and a Florentine leather pocket book; so Uncle John made a\ncollection of thirty-seven pipes of all shapes and sizes, and bought so\nmany pocketbooks that Patsy declared her father could use a different\none every day in the month.\n\n\"But they're handy things to have,\" said her uncle, \"and we may not get\nto Europe again in a hurry.\"\n\nThis was his excuse for purchasing many things, and it was only by\nreminding him of the duty he would have to pay in New York that the\ngirls could induce him to desist.\n\nThis customs tax worried the old gentleman at times. Before this trip he\nhad always believed in a protective tariff, but now he referred to the\nUnited States customs as a species of brigandage worse than that of Il\nDuca himself.\n\nThey stopped at Milan to visit the great cathedral, and then raced\nthrough Switzerland and made a dash from Luzerne to Paris.\n\n\"Thank heaven,\" said Uncle John, \"there are no cathedrals in gay Paree,\nat any rate.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes there are,\" they assured him. \"We must see Notre Dame, anyway;\nand there are a dozen other famous cathedrals.\"\n\nHere is where Uncle John balked.\n\n\"See here, my dears,\" he announced, \"Not a cathedral will I visit from\nthis time on! You can take a guide and go by yourselves if you feel you\ncan't let any get away from you. Go and find another of Mike Angelo's\nlast work; every church has got one. For my part, I've always been\nreligiously inclined, but I've been to church enough lately to last me\nthe rest of my natural life, and I've fully determined not to darken the\ndoors of another cathedral again. They're like circuses, anyhow; when\nyou've seen one, you've seen 'em all.\"\n\nNo argument would induce him to abandon this position; so the girls\naccepted his proposal and visited their beloved cathedrals in charge of\na guide, whose well of information was practically inexhaustible if not\nremarkable for its clarity.\n\nThe opera suited Uncle John better, and he freely revelled in the shops,\npurchasing the most useless and preposterous things in spite of that\ngrowing bugbear of the customs duties.\n\nBut finally this joyous holiday came to an end, as all good things will,\nand they sailed from Cherbourg for New York.\n\nUncle John had six extra trunks, Patsy carried a French poodle that was\nas much trouble as an infant in arms, and Louise engineered several\nhat-boxes that could not be packed at the last minute. But the girls\nembarked gay and rosy-cheeked and animated, and in spite of all the\nexcitement and pleasure that had attended their trip, not one of the\nparty was really sorry when the return voyage began.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nSAFE HOME\n\n\n\"To me,\" said Uncle John, as he stood on the deck and pointed proudly to\nthe statue of Liberty in New York harbor, \"that is the prettiest sight\nI've seen since I left home.\"\n\n\"Prettier than the old masters, Uncle?\" asked Patsy, mischievously.\n\n\"Yes, or the cathedrals!\" he retorted.\n\nWhen they reached the dock there was the Major waiting to receive Patsy\nin a new checked suit with a big flower in his button-hole and a broad\nsmile on his jolly face.\n\nAnd there was Mrs. Merrick, too, with Arthur Weldon beside her, which\nproved to Louise that he had succeeded in making his peace with her\nmother. Also there were the stern-featured custom-house officials in\ntheir uniforms, and the sight of them sent the cold chills flying down\nUncle John's spine.\n\nThere was no one present to receive Beth, but her uncle tucked her arm\nunderneath his own with a proud gesture and kept her close beside him.\nFor the girl had quite won his loving old heart on this trip, and she\nseemed to him more mature and far sweeter than when they had left home.\n\nBut the greetings and the \"brigandage\" were soon over, and in good time\nthey were all assembled in the Doyle flat, where the joyous Major had\nprepared an elaborate dinner to celebrate the return of the wanderers.\n\n\"We've a million pipes and pocket-books for you, daddy,\" whispered\nPatsy, hugging him for the twentieth time; \"and I've got a thousand\nthings to tell you about our adventures in strange lands.\"\n\n\"Save 'em till we're alone,\" said the Major; \"they're too good to waste\non a crowd.\"\n\nMr. Merrick was placed at the head of the table to make a speech. It was\nbrief and to the point.\n\n\"I promised these young ladies to give them time of their lives,\" he\nsaid, \"Did I do it, girls?\"\n\nAnd in a lively chorus they answered:\n\n\"You did, Uncle John!\"\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n     This story is one of the delightful \"Aunt Jane Series\" in\n     which are chronicled the many interesting adventures in the\n     lives of those fascinating girls and dear old \"Uncle John.\"\n     The other volumes can be bought wherever books are sold.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/about\/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":939,"split":"train"}
