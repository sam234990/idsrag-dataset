{"ori_id":"fe752f8c56b123e282f7798a98355057fc44b7a1","title":"Walam Olum","context":"Walam Olum\n The narrative begins with the formation of the universe, the shaping of the Earth, and the creation of the first people, by the Great Manitou. Then, as the Great Manitou creates more creatures, an evil manitou creates others, such as flies. Although all is harmonious at first, an evil being brings unhappiness, sickness, disasters and death. A great snake attacked the people and drove them from their homes. The snake flooded the land and made monsters in the water, but the Creator made a giant turtle, on which the surviving people rode out the flood, and prayed for the waters to recede. When land emerged again, they were in a place of snow and cold, so they developed their skills of house-building and hunting, and began explorations to find more temperate lands. Eventually, they chose to head east from the land of the Turtle to the land of the Snake, walking across the frozen ocean and first reaching a land of spruce trees.\nAfter a few generations (from this point on, chiefs of the tribe are named), they began to spread into the adjoining territories. Many generations passed (the characteristics of each chief briefly described), until a large part of the nation decided to invade the territory of the Talegawi people, aided by the northern Talamatan. Although the invasion eventually succeeded, the Talamatan later became hostile, but were soon subdued, and a further long period of consolidation began. Slow expansion into the rich eastern lands eventually reached another sea, where, after generations, the first white men arrived in ships.\nThere the text ends, though Rafinesque did publish an additional \"Fragment: On the History of the Linapis since abt. 1600, when the Wallamolum closes\" which takes the story up to his own time. This (which incidentally names the composer of the original Walam Olum as one Lekhibit) exists only as a purported translation by John Burns, who has himself never been satisfactorily identified.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The American Nations, Vol. I. by C.

This\nhomage is due to the public approbation you gave to my first analogous\nlabor, my Memoirs or Series of Researches on the Origin of Mankind: which\nI endeavored to trace philologically to the centre of Asia. I had\nannounced long ago this history of the Americans, the inhabitants of a\nwhole hemisphere. I had quoted it in my other works. I now offer the\noutlines of it under your auspices.\n\nYou have furnished the example of cultivating along with Geography, all\nthe auxiliary and connected sciences, which may enlighten it: particularly\nthe ancient and modern Ethnography, with Philology one of its bases. You\nwill see that I have followed this practice in availing myself of all the\nsciences to enlighten the history of mankind, the Ethnography and annals\nof nations: above all Philology with Chronology and Geography.\n\nThe origins and annals of the black nations, and of the American nations,\nwere two subjects quite obscure and neglected, or the least known, of the\nhistory of mankind. Nobody has undertaken, as yet, the history of the\nNegro nations: a labor so difficult and luckless as to be despised.\n\nMy memoirs on this despised race, may perhaps furnish the bases of such\nhistory. All the histories of America are mere fragments or dreams. I have\nperceived the possibility and necessity to write a general and faithful\nhistory of this hemisphere. I now offer the results of this weary labor.\n\nYou will perceive in it many things which have already been said; since it\nis impossible to write history without repetitions; but my plan, the whole\npoint of view, and the results which I draw, are my own. You will also\nfind many things which were never told or were very improperly presented.\nI shall destroy many errors, hypotheses and conjectures: since in them\nalone often consist our works upon America.\n\nBut I shall not say every thing; where so much is to be related, all\ncannot be told: and I shall be compelled to neglect several minute\ndetails. I wish to trace faithful outlines, rather than write a bulky\nwork, like our pretending _universal histories_, which however, dwell only\nupon one-third of the globe or even less.\n\nI dislike long quotations, and shall seldom employ them: I quote only when\nauthorities are required to render an opinion more forcible. Every where\nelse I merely give the abridgement of my great historical materials in\nmanuscript, which are arranged by extracts of authorities, and where they\nmay be sought for in case of need.\n\nAccept, Gentlemen, the respectful homage of\n\nThe Author.\n\nPHILADELPHIA,\n_October 22d, 1833_.\n\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE.\n\n\nIn venturing to open a new path in historical researches on the earth and\nmankind, it is incumbent on the bold pioneer to state his views, or at\nleast to furnish adequate reasons for deviating so far from the usual\ntrack.\n\nWhile every science and branch of knowledge is improving, and has, with\nrapid strides, made continual advances for fifty years past or more, is\nthe noble muse of history to be kept stationary forever, by compilers and\nclassical plodders? and for America by the foes of the ancient and modern\nnations of a whole hemisphere? No ... it is time to improve history as\nevery thing else; to seek the truth and tell it.\n\nAs the human mind is yet more swayed by authorities, than genius or\nwisdom; high authorities will be given instead of long explanations. Ever\nsince the time of Juvenal, it has been an ungrateful task to write\nhistorical truth: men often prefer to be amused, deceived, or helped in\nstrife; than to be instructed, or receive sketches of former times. Yet\nthere is always a secret delight in viewing faithful pictures of ages\npast, of our ancestors on earth, and our predecessors on the soil of our\nhomes, or where we spend the scenes of our own lives.\n\nThe worthies who have been taken for models or guides in this arduous\nundertaking, are Solomon, Moses, Job, St. Paul, St. Augustine, Plato,\nNiebuhr, Humboldt, Malcolm, Gebelin, D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Olivet, Bryant, Adelung, Drummond,\nPritchard, Champollion, Klaproth, Jones, Wilford, Akbar, Price, Bailly,\nRussell, Beattie, Herder, Carli, Barton &c.

(The true SHEOL was\nAmerica, or the southern hemisphere). The Jesuit Sanetius thought that Job\nhad spoken of America.\u00e2\u0080\u0094PETERS, _Dissertation on Job_.\n\nIt is very possible for modern learning to understand better the books of\nMoses, Orpheus, and those of all ancient nations, than the Egyptian, Greek\nand Roman commentators: because the intellectual knowledge of languages is\nimproving; and those ancient writers have, by their genius, approximated\nto us, while removed from the blindness of their ages.\u00e2\u0080\u0094GEBELIN, _Primitive\nWorld_.\n\nThe letter kills, but the spirit gives life.\u00e2\u0080\u0094ST. PAUL _Corinth._ II. ch.\n3. v. 6.

II. 3. v. 12, 13._\u00e2\u0080\u0094and even unto\nthis day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart, nevertheless\nwhen it shall please the Lord, this veil shall be taken away.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Cor. II. 3.\nv. 15, 16._\n\nTo have a right apprehension of words or names, is a good step to the\nknowledge of things.\u00e2\u0080\u0094PLATO _in Cratylo_.\n\nThe confusion of words is the cause of all disputes and sects.\u00e2\u0080\u0094D\u00e2\u0080\u0099ISRAELI.\n\nThe obscure ages demand bold hypotheses or total neglect, contradictions\nare inseparable from days of tradition.\u00e2\u0080\u0094There exist no instance of a\npeople really savage having spontaneously advanced to civilization. Savage\nmen are degenerated or imperfect creatures.... Words and even few are the\nrules of analogies in nations.\u00e2\u0080\u0094NIEBUHR, _Roman History, Vol. I._\n\nIt is manifest that there are noble resources (for history) still\nremaining, if we will but apply ourselves to diligent enquiry. There are\nin every climate some scattered fragments of original history, some traces\nof a primitive and universal language. _Even America would contribute to\nthis purpose, the more rude the monuments, the more ancient they may\npossibly prove, and afford greater light on enquiry._ BRYANT, MYTHOLOGY;\nconclusion of the work.\n\nTo accumulate materials without generalizing any idea is a method as\nsterile in history as in natural philosophy.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The geology of America does\nnot differ essentially from that of the old world, the strata and the\nemersion from the waters are not newer: species long extinct have also\npreceded those now peopling the earth, the waters and the air.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The problem\nof the first population of America is no more the province of history,\nthan the questions on the origin of plants and animals. When we shall\nbetter know the brown men of Africa, with those of the north and east of\nAsia, the American nations will be less insulated\u00e2\u0080\u0094They have extended from\nlat. 68 N. to 55 S. or 123 degrees of latitude, in plains and mountains,\nassuming various complexions and stature. If Africa has 140 languages,\nAmerica has still more; resembling in this, the Caucasus, Italy before the\nRomans; but they are susceptible of classification into families. The\nmultiplicity of languages is a very ancient phenomenon, perhaps those\nwhich we call American, belong no more to America, than the Magyar and\nChoud or Finn to Europe.\u00e2\u0080\u0094HUMBOLDT, _American Researches, Introduction_.\n\nIf we desire to be fully informed of a nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history, we must not\nreject the fables under which the few traces that remain of its origin are\nconcealed. These, however extravagant, always merit attention they have an\ninfluence on the character of the people to whom they relate.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_First words\nof_ MALCOLM, _History of Persia_.\n\nThe Chinese often call the king, the kingdom and the nation by the same\nname, nay, even also the capital city.\u00e2\u0080\u0094REGIS, _History of Corea, in\nDuhalde China_.\n\nThe cradle or first seat of mankind was in Asia, between lat. 30 and 50;\nwhich is also the native place of all the domestic animals, fruits and\ngrains.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Adelung, Bailly, Higgins, &c._\n\nThe Genesis was a compilation of Moses from older annals, some perhaps by\nNoah himself.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Revd.

All languages have something in common, and\nsomething peculiar.\u00e2\u0080\u0094BEATTIE, _Theory of Language_.\n\nA thousand nations with a thousand idioms, are spread over a thousand\nplaces on earth. Thrown against each other like the waves of the sea, they\nblend and tend to unity. Several rival languages are formed, polished by\ncontract, which overspread the earth; and break to pieces as well as\nnations and empires. Others arise from their ruins, and strive again for\nascendency, until at last a people and language, son and daughter of all\nthe previous nations and idioms, heirs of their dominion and wealth; shall\nperhaps invade the whole earth, and produce again the unity of speech and\nrule.\u00e2\u0080\u0094D\u00e2\u0080\u0099OLIVET, _End of Hebrew Grammar_.\n\nIt is said, _In the beginning God made Heaven and Earth_, that is to say,\nthe seeds of heaven and earth, since their matter was yet in confusion in\na potential way.\u00e2\u0080\u0094ST.

PROTHOLIA or THOLARKON, the ancient world, containing, 1. Asia, 2.\nAfrica, 3. Europe, which are continents.\n\nII. NEOTHOLIA or HESPERIA, the new world, containing, 1. _Atalia_ or North\nAmerica, 2. _Columbia_ or South America, which are two continents ... and\n3. the _Antilles_ or West Indies, the Archipelagos to the East and North,\nCarib and Lucayes islands.\n\nIII. OCEANIA or THOLONESIA, the Oceanic or Insular world, containing, 1.\n_Australia_, which is a continent, 2. _Meganesia_ or the great Islands\nfrom Japan till Ceylan and Madagascar, 3. _Polynesia_, the small Eastern\nIslands. These two last form immense groups of archipelagos, or clustered\nislands.\n\nTherefore the terrestrial world includes 6 continents, and 3 groups of\narchipelagos, forming 9 geotomes.\n\nIt is of NEOTHOLIA that I write the history, of this third of the world,\nnamed likewise America, or the two Americas; a double continent, crowned\nin the East and towards the two poles by archipelagos.\n\nSuch an extensive part of the world, reaching nearly to both poles, offers\nto our notice and researches a crowd of objects, nations and events. If\nour universal histories which are confined to a small part only of the old\nworld, form already bulky collections; it would be equally so with\nAmerica, if we had complete annals of it. But, notwithstanding the scanty\nmaterials which have reached us on its ancient history; the modern annals\nand the old traditions of the nations dwelling there, afford many facts:\nand many auxiliary means contribute to enlarge the previous history, in\nunfolding the origins and revolutions of the nations and empires of both\nAmericas. Thus, we shall often have to make a choice or abridge these\nmaterials, particularly in these outlines of a general history.\n\nFormerly, historians wrote chiefly chronicles of the empires, kingdoms and\nrepublics; which were often mere biographies of monarchs and chiefs,\nconquerors and tyrants. We begin now to think more of mankind and the\nnations. I shall follow this principle, and trace at last a national\nhistory of America; this subject is so new, that we have not even yet a\ngood history of mankind in Europe, much less in Asia and Africa.\n\nHaving dwelt in this continent since 1802, having settled in it since\n1815, and having travelled in it every year to study the monuments and\nproductions thereof: it was since 1818 that I began to conceive the\npossibility of raising the veil that was thrown over the annals of this\nthird of the world. I have visited the public libraries of Washington,\nBaltimore, Philadelphia, New-York, Boston, Albany, Lexington, &c. to\nconsult all the historical works on America, and every other part of the\nworld. I have read nearly all the travels in America and other distant\ncountries. In the Ebeling library deposited in that of Cambridge\nUniversity near Boston, I have found many ancient works on America, often\nunique in the United States, and very rare even in Europe. There is but a\nsmall number of rare works, which I have not yet been able to see; I shall\ngive a list of them, in order that it may be ascertained whether they\ncontain facts that have escaped me. My researches upon the languages and\nmonuments of America, will compensate this unavoidable neglect, since they\nexceed whatever had been undertaken of the kind. I have thus endeavored to\ncollect and compare all the facts relating to my subject.\n\nI have not imitated, therefore, the lazy writers, who have pretended to\ngive us histories of America, and have commonly produced mere sketches of\nit, full of neglects and defects. Such were Robertson, Holmes, Touron,\nHerrera, &c., with a crowd of imitators and compilers, which confine\nthemselves to some years, or a single region, or the mere first Spanish\ninvasions. They have, however, acquired some reputation either by style or\nmanner; but they have degraded history, by giving sketches instead of it.\nWe must except Herrera, who does not shine by the style; but is at least a\nfaithful annalist of the Spanish deeds and colonies during 62 years, from\n1492 till 1552. But Robertson, although praised for his style, is only his\nunfaithful and imperfect imitator, and the obvious slanderer of the\nAmerican nations.\n\nA complete criticism of the writers on America, would be desirable; but\ncannot enter into the plan of these historical outlines; although it may\nfind a place in ulterior illustrations. It will be sufficient now to\nindicate that the best works, or those which furnish the greatest number\nof historical materials, are the old writers and travellers, since the\nmodern historians and travellers (except Humboldt and a few more) appear\nto forget whatever has already been written on America.\n\nThe historian of such an extensive continent, should not be a mere\nannalist; but he ought to know well all the comparative sciences, sisters\nof history, such as chronology, geography, biography, archeology,\nethnography, philology, &c. He ought also to be a philosopher and a\nphilanthropist, to know the natural sciences which become connected with\nhistory by civilization, agriculture, and geology; he ought, above all, to\nbe impartial and a good critic, in order to discard national prejudices,\nand avoid the blunders of credulity or imposture. What historian has ever\nunited such acquirements? I have tried to acquire them: Have I succeeded?\nI offer my writings as the answer.\n\nMy method has been to make copious extracts of all the authors that I\nread. These materials already form a collection of over one hundred books\nof 6000 pages on the history of the earth and mankind: whereof I avail\nmyself for all my historical works. I have formed besides another\ncollection of iconographic illustrations, maps, plans, monuments, views,\nportraits, alphabets, symbols, implements, costumes, &c.; which may serve\nfor proofs and atlas of these works, published or manuscript. This\ntellurian iconography, chiefly American, consists already in ten great\nbooks or portfolios; having little hope to be enabled to publish them, I\nwish they might be deposited in a great public library, where they might\nbe consulted.\n\nInstead of beginning this history of the Americans by generalities, I\nshould wish to conclude the work by such results; but it may frequently be\nneedful to deviate from this plan, and present results as they happen to\narise from the facts and events.\n\nThe different parts of the Western Hemisphere are often distantly remote,\nand insulated, or little connected in their historical relations. Austral\nAmerica and Boreal America have for instance hardly any historical\nconnection: they are as widely separated as China and Europe; but all the\ncentral parts of America are intimately connected, above all the mountain\nregions from Mexico to Chili, which offer the same relation of\ncivilization, languages and annalogies, as the Hindu-European regions and\nnations.\n\nThe Neotholian Hemisphere contains many distinct regions; but the natural\nor physical regions are not always identic with the historical regions.\nThe isthmus of Panama or valley of Choco does not divide the nation as it\ndoes the two continents of America: and many groups of nations are\nintermingled throughout. The group of ancient ARUAC nations extended from\nnear Florida through the Antilles, Guyana, Brazil to Tucuman and\nMagellania. The elder group of TALA or atlantic nations could be traced\nfrom the Ohio to Mexico, Guatimala and South America in the west.\n\nNotwithstanding this fact, it is useful to keep in mind the great natural\nregions of America, so as to trace through them the vicissitudes of\nmankind in ancient and modern times. Thus we find six such regions in\nNorth America, and six in South America, with 3 in the Antilles.\n\n1. Boreal region, or region of the lakes, stretching across North America,\nfrom the streight of Behring and peninsula Alaska in the west, to\nLabrador, Canada and Nova Scotia in the east. It is distinguished by a\nrocky soil, many large lakes and millions of small ones, surrounded near\nthe pole and on either side by groups of islands. Its southern limits are\nundefined, but Lake Erie forms one of them.\n\n2. The Californian or Oregon region, stretching from north to south along\nthe Pacific Ocean from Fuca Strait to Mexico and Guatimala. It is a region\nof plains and hills.\n\n3. The Mexican region or central mountains and table lands from the\nsources of the Missouri to Lake Nicaragua, distinguished by volcanoes, a\ndry lofty soil, &c.\n\n4. The Missouri region, extending in vast grassy plains from latitude 50\nto the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n5. The Alleghany region, stretching in woody hills and mountains from\nMaine to Alabama and Illinois. The Ozark mountains and the whole of New\nEngland appear detached portions of it.\n\n6. The Literal Atlantic region, stretching from Long Island to Florida,\nMexico, Yucatan and Honduras, forming a long but narrow region of level\nplains, sands and marshes, skirted by sandy shores and islands.\n\nThe Antilles or West Indies, are all islands; divided into 3 very natural\ngroups.\n\n1. The large and hilly Islands of Jamaica, Cuba, Hayti, Boriquen.\n\n2. The Lucayes or Bahama Islands north of them, low and chiefly of coral\nformations.\n\n3. The Carib Islands east and south, commonly volcanic.\n\nThe regions of South America are 1. That of the Andes or high volcanic\nmountains extending from Santa Marta to the Island of Chilo\u00c3\u00a9, stretching\nbranches east as far as Cumana, and east of Peru. The hills of Panama from\nNicaragua to Choco, are a detached part of it, probably once an island of\nthe size of Cuba. Also the Magellanic or Austral region, including the\nhills and islands south of Chili, all detached from the Andes, with the\narchipelagos of Chilo\u00c3\u00a9, Chonos, Fuego, Austral, Falkland, &c. often\nvolcanic.\n\n2. The Atacama region, or lowlands along the Pacific Ocean from the\nvalleys of Darien and Choco to Chili, distinguished by sterility.\n\n3. The Pampas or region of unwooded plains east of the Andes from the\nstrait of Magellan to Paraguay and Chaco.\n\n4. The region of Brazil, distinguished by fertile hills, mountains and\nvalleys, forming a vast group of high lands connected to the Andes by an\nisthmus.\n\n5. The region of Guyana or Parima, of shady hills perfectly insulated\n(once a large island) by the plains of the Maranon and Oronoc.\n\n6. The vast equinoctical plains of Oronoc and Maranon, surrounding the\nmountains of Parima: where deserts, swamps and forests are mixed.\n\nThese 15 regions are quite natural, distinguished by peculiar physical,\nand geological features; but they do not coincide with the ethnological\nregions, where the American tribes have spread and intermixed. It would be\ndifficult to state here even the most striking of these last. It will be\nthe aim of this work to seek for them, and ascertain their limits; which\nhave often varied anciently: while in modern times the European colonies\nand states have invaded them in all directions.\n\nMeantime the population of both Americas, must be distinguished in ancient\nand modern.\n\nIn proceeding from the known to the unknown: we ascertain that a multitude\nof nations have come to America since 1492, as colonists or visitors. The\nprincipal were\n\n1. _Spanish_: who have colonized or conquered from New Mexico to Chili,\nand from Florida to Buenos Ayres. But they came not alone, and have\nbrought along with them as auxiliaries. 1. Italians, 2. Flemish, 3.\nBiscayans, 4. Canarians, &c., while as slaves 5. Moors of Mauritania, and\n6. Many African-negro nations.\n\n2. _Portugueze_: who have colonized the whole of Brazil, and brought there\nbesides many Negro nations, some Moors, Gypsies, Chinese, &c.\n\n3. _English_: Who have colonized the whole eastern side of North America,\nJamaica and other islands of Antilles, with parts of Yucatan, Honduras,\nGuyana, &c. But they have brought with them, the Welsh, Scotch, Irish,\nGermans, Jews and many African nations.\n\n4. _French_: They colonized Canada, Lousiana, Hayti, several Carib\nislands, Cayenne in Guyana, &c., and although conquered in North America\nand Hayti, their language remains. They brought along the Proven\u00c3\u00a7als,\nBretons, Basks, speaking distinct languages, with several African nations.\n\n5. _Scandinavians_: Who partly settled in North America since the 10th\ncentury, did laterly colonize again Groenland, with Delaware and some\nCarib Islands. They include the Norwegians, Danes and Swedes.\n\n6. _Dutch-Hollanders_: Sent colonies to New-York, Surinam, Curazao, &c.\nbrought Gypsies, Germans and Africans.\n\n7. _Russians_: Have invaded and partly settled the north west shores and\nislands of North America; bringing there Cozacs, Calmucs, and several\nother Tartarian subjects.\n\n8. Besides these, several other nations have laterly visited America, or\nsettled therein, blending with the above. All the nations of Europe, even\nHungarians, Polanders, Greeks and Turks, have been brought there. Pirates\nof all nations, even Algerines, have wandered to America. Almost all the\nnations of Africa have been led there in slavery. Asia has sent Jews,\nHindus, Gypsies or Zinganis, Chinese and Tartars: while Oceania has sent\nMalays, Madagascars, Hawayans, &c.\n\nThis well known fact of the various and anomalous modern population of\nboth Americas within 3 or 4 centuries, will greatly help us to form a more\ncorrect estimate of the ancient population and colonization of such vast\ncountries during many thousand years previous to 1492.\n\nIt is not yet suitable to give here a complete list of all the ancient\nnations, who have, or may have colonized the Western hemisphere: this can\nonly be done afterwards as a result of the instituted enquiries on the\nsubject. Meantime I state as highly probable, even by mere analogy, that\nall the nearest nations of the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans, in the Eastern\nhemisphere, have either visited or colonized the Americas; particularly\nfrom the east, the bold navigators, Atlantes, Pelagians, Phenicians,\nLybyans, Etruscans, &c., and from the west the ancient tribes of Tartars\nand Chinese, the Polynesians, &c. We shall throughout these historical\noutlines find ample proofs of this fact, exploding the erroneous belief\nthat a single nation could have populated the whole of the Western\nHemisphere. It shall appear also that these early settlers must have\nbrought along many foreign tribes, as auxiliaries, vassals or slaves.\n\nIn my Atlantic Journal of 1832 will be found a kind of classification of\nthe ancient nations of both Americas, divided into 25 groups, 14 in North,\n11 in South America. But this first attempt, cannot be perfect: it\nrequires a close study of all the American languages, before we can\nascertain correctly all their mutual affinities, and reduce each to the\nreal parent group. Meantime this attempt, and the further correction of it\nin this work, will become very useful historical bases. I give therefore\nthe list of the 25 groups, with a well known nation and language as the\ntype, to which others may be gradually reduced.\n\nIn North America 1. _Uski_ or _Innuit_, type the Esquimaux.\n\n2. _Ongwi_, type the Hurons and Iroquois.\n\n3. _Linni_, type the Lanapi or Delawares.\n\n4. _Wacash_, type the Chopunish, and Nutkas.\n\n5. _Skerreh_, type the Panis.\n\n6. _Nachez_, type the Cados and Chetimachas.\n\n7. _Capaha_, types the Washas or Ozages, and Dacotas or Sioux.\n\n8. _Chactah_, types the Chactahs and Chicasas.\n\n9. _Otali_, Tzulukis or Cherokis.\n\n10. _Atalan_, type the Tarascas.\n\n11. _Otomi_, type the Otomis.\n\n12. _Anahuac_, type the Aztecas.\n\n13. _Maya_, types the Mayas and Huaztecas.\n\n14. _Chontal_, type the Tzendals and Chols.\n\nIn South America 15. _Aruac_, types the Haytians, Aruacs, Taos, &c.\n\n16. _Calina_, types the Caribs and Tamanacs.\n\n17. _Puris_, type the Maypuris.\n\n18. _Yarura_, types the Guaraos and Betoys.\n\n19. _Cuna_, type the Dariens.\n\n20. _Mayna_, type the Panos.\n\n21. _Maca_, type the Muyzcas.\n\n22. _Guarani_, type the Tupis and Omaguas.\n\n23. _Mara_, type the Quichuas and Aymaras.\n\n24. _Lul\u00c3\u00a9_, types the Vilelas and Mbayas.\n\n25. _Chili_, type the Chilians.\n\nNotwithstanding the condensed form of these outlines, the ample materials\nto be brought together, will extend them perhaps beyond the desirable\nlimits. In order to lessen this difficulty and yet omit nothing that is\nnew or important, the work will be divided into three series.\n\n1st. The annals of South America, where many generalities will be\nintroduced, that need not be repeated in the 2d series, on the annals of\nNorth America.\n\n3d. Illustrations of these outlines, where will be thrown and collected\nall the collateral proofs, documents, vocabularies of languages,\nmanuscript facts and events, essential quotations, and results of all the\ninvestigations.\n\nThe Peruvian and Austral regions of South America will first be\nintroduced, because of paramount importance. By the Peruvian region is\nmeant the whole western part of South America from the equator to the\nsouthern tropic, and by Austral America, the whole of it from that tropic\nto the Magellanic Islands. The gulf of Rio Plata and the river Paraguay,\nappear to divide these regions from Brazil, both physically and\nhistorically. Austral America includes the countries and nations of Chili,\nTucuman, Chaco, Buenos Ayres, Patagonia and Magellania; but it shall often\nbe needful to mention their neighbors, with whom they are more or less\nrelated, and even distant nations that are not always strangers to them.\n\nThe ancient nations of Austral America are the least known on many\naccounts, and those on whom most fables and systems have been based. It is\nthere that dwell the _Patagons_, who have been believed a peculiar species\nof giants; and those tribes of Chaco, &c., which Azara has deemed peculiar\nmen, with languages without affinities with any other: which will easily\nbe proved to be quite false.\n\nIf America has had an aboriginal population, or _Autoctons_, men born from\nthe soil: it is there they should be found, driven to the south and those\nremote climes by the ancient colonies of other nations; and they should\noffer features, complexions, languages and manners totally different from\nany other. If all the Americans derive from ancient colonies, it is still\nthere that ought to be found the primitive tribes, driven on by the\nsubsequent colonies and tribes. Therefore these Austral tribes are\nexceedingly interesting to study as the most ancient relics of American\npopulation.\n\nBut the origin of the American nations and tribes are only to be\nconsidered as a branch of their history. The accounts of their dispersion\nand successive settlements, the history of the events which they have\nremembered and transmitted to us by traditions or annals, those of the\nempires which have been founded there in ancient and modern times, the\nstudy of their civilization and ethnography ... offer surely much more\ninterest, and a wide field of historical facts or enquiries.\n\nIt appears that as soon as we speak of the ancient Americans, we ought to\ncut the gordian knot, and say whence they came. I do not wish to explain\nbeforehand, all my views on this subject. I wish to reserve them for the\nresults of the enquiries to be pursued in this work. Yet to satisfy the\ngeneral curiosity expressed on the subject, I may venture to say that I\nhave not yet found in either Americas, any people or tribe totally\ndifferent from any other, or without philological affinities: nor with\nfeatures, complexions, and other physical characters quite peculiar. But\ninstead, all the ancient American tribes have numerous affinities between\neach other, and with races of mankind in the Eastern hemisphere: both\nphysical and moral, as well as philological.\n\nIf the American nations sprung from ancient colonies; it is among the\nprimitive population of the earth, that their parents must be sought and\nfound: since America appears to have been partly peopled even before the\nflood. Therefore the systems which would derive them all from the\nPhenicians, Jews, Chinese, Tartars of later ages, or any single people\nwhatever, must be absurd and improbable: since traces of many ancient\nnations are found in this western hemisphere.\n\nIt has always appeared probable to me that most of the ancient colonies to\nAmerica, must have come there by the nearest and most direct way; the same\nnearly followed again by Columbus in 1492: either from north Africa or\nsouth Europe. This becomes still more probable if there were formerly a\nland or large islands in the Atlantic Ocean; of which we have ample\nproofs. Nearly all the nations from Florida and Mexico to Chili, appear to\nhave reached America from the east, through the tropical islands or\nAntilles; but the ancestors of these emigrating tribes, dwelt once in\nAsia, which appears the cradle of mankind.\n\nHowever, many nations of Brazil and Guyana are more recent and of African\norigin; while nearly all those of North America appear to have reached\nAmerica by the opposite direction of Eastern Asia, through Alaska or the\nStreight of Behring, once an Isthmus. Therefore the Colonial tribes came\nhere from the East, and the North West. It is more doubtful that any came\nfrom the West or Polynesia.\n\nWhat is now needful, is to trace these colonies, their travels, epochas,\nand ascertain the nations which they have produced in both Americas. This\nI will endeavour to do, without being prevented by the difficulties of the\ntask. I shall always seek to ascertain the true names of each nation or\ntribe: which have often been disguised under a crowd of nicknames and\nerroneous orthographies. These names when thus restored will often furnish\nan original key, to supply the scarcely known languages, or lost\ntraditions.\n\nThe Brigands who brought desolation over both Americas during two\ncenturies, and the careless travellers who visited them in search of\nwealth, took little notice of the languages and traditions of their\nvictims or foes. Thus we have to regret the loss of many valuable\nmaterials, merely indicated. However, a few enlightened visitors, and the\nmissionaries have preserved some of them. The first attempt of the kind\nwas the outlines of historical songs and traditions of Hayti, collected as\nearly as 1498 by friar Roman, at the request of Columbus; printed by his\nson, and by Barcias. Yet this valuable document has escaped the notice of\nnearly all the writers on America! evident proof of utter carelessness or\nneglect.\n\nPiedrahita has given some of the historical traditions of the Muyzcas;\nJuarros the annals of the Toltecas of Guatimala; Ayeta and Herrera those\nof the Mayas of Yucatan. Yet they have been neglected by our historians.\nThey have merely dwelt, and even sparingly, on the annals of Mexico and\nPeru. We have besides fragments on the early history of the Ongwis,\nLinapis, Apalachis, Caribs, Dariens, and a few more; but we have to regret\nthe loss of the written annals of many civilized nations, the Tarascas,\nHuaztecas, Zapotecas, Nicaraguas, Chontals, Chilians, Panos, &c. Some of\nwhich may perhaps be yet partly recovered, as those of the Ongwis and\nLinapis have lately been.\n\nIt is only since last age that the study of comparative philology has\nbegun to be appreciated: and quite recently that languages have been made\nsubservient to historical researches. Pigafetta had, however, set the\nexamples as early as 1520 to collect American vocabularies, of which he\ngave two, the Brazilian and Patagon: which are quite important, since by\nthem we trace both tribes seen by him to the ARUAC race. For lack of\nfrequent ancient vocabularies, we must often grope in the dark; but I do\nnot despair to be able to restore many lost languages, by fragments\nescaped from the common ruin. I have already succeeded with the _Taino_ of\nHayti, the _Cahiri_ of Trinidad, _Talega_ and _Apalachi_ of North America,\nthe _Chontal_ of central America, the _Colla_ of Peru, and the _S\u00c3\u00a9k\u00c3\u00a9_ of\nold Chili; whereby I shall draw some happy conclusions.\n\nAsia has been the country of fables, Africa of monsters, and America of\nsystems, for those who prefer opinions to reality. The systems and\nhypotheses of philosophy or ignorance upon America, exceed all the Asiatic\nfables. A crowd of prejudices, false opinions and fantastic theories, have\nbeen asserted on this hemisphere, often mistaking a small part of it for\nthe whole. Some have declared all the Americans a red, beardless, naked\nand barbarous race, or a peculiar species of men. Others that they came\nout of the ground or from the clouds, or over a bridge, instead of boats\nor on the ice. Others that they are all Jews, or Malays, or Tartars.\nLastly, even that Eden was here and Noah built the ark in America! All\nthese systems and fifty more brought forth by ignorance or pride, are\nbased upon the most absurd proofs, or a few insulated facts: while there\nare historical facts easy to prove that are neglected or forgotten.\n\nThus it is a positive fact that many ancient nations of the east, such as\nthe Lybians, Moors, Etruscans, Phenicians, Hindus, &c. had heard of\nAmerica, or knew nearly as much of it, as we did of Australia and\nPolynesia 100 years ago. It is as certain that America contained\nanciently, as even now, a crowd of distinct nations and tribes; some of\nwhich were quite civilized, perhaps as much as the Spaniards led by\nColumbus; the others more barbarous, but not entirely savage. There were\nbut few, if any, real savages in America, dwelling in woods without social\nties; most of them were wandering tribes of fishermen or hunters.\n\nThere were formerly in America as now, tribes of all complexions, as\nelsewhere: yellowish, olive, coppery, tawny, redened, brown, incarnate or\nwhite, and even blackened or negro-like. Tall and dwarfish men from 8 to 4\nfeet in size, called giants and pygmies\u00e2\u0080\u0094men with various frames, skulls,\nand features, of all the sorts found in the eastern hemisphere.\n\nThe Americans had long before Columbus, large cities; built of stones,\nbricks or wood, with walls, ditches, temples, palaces. Some of which were\nof immense size and population. One of them _Otolum_ near Palenque was 28\nmiles long, equal to Thebes, Babylon and Kinoj in size and monuments.\nNearly all the ancient sciences and useful primitive arts were known in\nAmerica, as well as commerce and navigation, symbolic and alphabetic\nwriting, nearly all the Asiatic religions, &c. The most civilized nations\nhad even colleges and universities, canals and paved roads, splendid\ntemples and monuments, &c.\n\nIt would be tedious to designate all what has not been told, or been very\nunworthily noticed, upon America. The whole of these outlines shall be\ncomments upon the forgotten facts relating to this third of the world.\nSuch as are found recorded by chance in one or few authors, scattered in\n1000 volumes, unsought and unnoticed by nearly all the other writers.\n\nRespecting the chronology of the American annals, it is rather obscure and\ndoubtful; but perhaps not more so than that of all ancient nations except\nthe Chinese. It frequently ascends as far as the floods and even the\ncreation. The most ancient dates are found among the Tols or Toltecas and\nAtlantes, Mexicans or Aztecas, the Muyzcas, Ongwis, Linapis, &c. But it is\ndifficult to make those dates agree among themselves, or with our oriental\ndates. However the American annals may be divided into great periods,\nwhich can be admitted as certain, and resting points of history at\npeculiar epochas.\n\nHere is their tabular view.\n\nI. Ancient history, ending with Columbus in 1492.\n\n1. _Antidiluvian period_, beginning at the creation, about 6690 years\nbefore Columbus according to the Tols, and ending with the last cataclysm\nof Peleg, about 3788 years before Columbus.\n\n2. _Doubtful period_, from that epocha till the reform of Tol astronomy,\n1612 years before Columbus. This includes several subordinate periods and\nepochas.\n\nAbout 3100 years before Columbus, settlement of the Linapis in Shinaki or\nFirland or Oregon in N. W. America.\n\nAbout 2500 years before Columbus, wars of the Towancas and Ongwis, the\nhero Yatatan, &c. in North America.\n\n3. _Certain period_, from 1612 till Columbus\u00e2\u0080\u0099 arrival in 1492. Many lesser\nperiods and epochas.\n\n442, after Christ\u00e2\u0080\u0094End of the Tollan kingdom.\n\n492,\u00e2\u0080\u0094Beginning of Atotarho dynasty of Ongwis.\n\n558,\u00e2\u0080\u0094Empire of Tol-tecas begins in Anahuac, and lasts till 942.\n\n840,\u00e2\u0080\u0094Beginning of the wars of Zipanas and Caris in South Peru.\n\n947,\u00e2\u0080\u0094Foundation of the kingdom of Mayapan by Cuculcan in Yucatan.\n\n985,\u00e2\u0080\u0094Discovery of America by the Norwegians.\n\n1000,\u00e2\u0080\u0094Conquest of Quito by the Skiris.\n\n1105,\u00e2\u0080\u0094Beginning of the Incas empire.\n\n1322,\u00e2\u0080\u0094Foundation of Tenuchtitlan or Mexico.\n\nII. Modern history, from 1492 till our days.\n\n1. _Colonial Period_, from 1492 till 1776.\n\n2. _Independent Period_, beginning in 1776. The foundation of the empire\nof Brazil in 1822 may begin a subordinate period.\n\nEach age may bear the name of a wise legislator or eminent personage: the\nages of modern history are those of 1. Columbus, 2. Las-Casas, 3. William\nPenn, 4. Washington, 5. Bolivar.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\n    MATERIALS FOR THE HISTORY OF THE AMERICANS.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Authors, Documents,\n    Sciences.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Languages, Civilization, &c._\n\n\nFar from following the example of many American historians, who often take\na single guide for their crude compilations, or avoid the trouble to\nconsult all the historical sources, I have taken care in my researches to\nemploy all the possible means to reach the truth, and collect all the\nfacts that are scattered among a crowd of writers. I have carefully\nanalysed, compared and judged the materials, details and events thus\nprocured: nay, all the auxiliary sciences have afforded additional\nfragments or proofs.\n\nThese materials may be divided into 10 series or kinds\n\n1. Works, printed or manuscript.\n2. Documents and monuments.\n3. Maps, plans, views, &c.\n4. Natural sciences.\n5. Ethnography.\n6. Traditions and annals.\n7. Chronology and astronomy.\n8. Languages and philology.\n9. Religion, mythologies, &c.\n10. Civilization, laws and manners.\n\nThe writers upon America are very numerous; but mostly defective or local.\nA number, however, have attempted to consider the whole continent: the\nprincipal among those containing facts upon all parts of America are\nchiefly\n\nHerrera, History and Geography of Spanish America carried till the year\n1554.\n\nDelaet, Historical Geography of America, till 1630.\n\nGarcias, Origins of the Americans.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Spanish work.\n\nCarli, American Letters.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Italian work.\n\nOgilby, History and Geography of America, till 1670.\n\nRaynal, European Settlements in America, till 1774.\n\nAlcedo, Geographical Dictionary of Spanish America in 1786.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Spanish work.\n\nMaltebrun, Improved Geography, 1820.\n\nTouron, History of America, chiefly ecclesiastical, and incomplete, 14\nvolumes 1768-70, in French.\n\nRobertson, false History of America or Spanish Conquests of Mexico or\nPeru.\n\nThe collections of travels by Hackluyt, Purchas, Harris, Ramusio, Barcias,\nPrevost, &c.\n\nThe American researches of Ulloa, Humboldt, M\u00e2\u0080\u0099Culloh, &c.\n\nI have consulted and analyzed all these general works, and many others of\nless account; but I have not yet read Hervas nor Compagnone, knowing them\nmerely through quotations\n\nThe first _Bibliotheca Americana_ or catalogue of writers on America, was\ngiven by Kennet in 1701 and 1713. Another appeared in England in 1719; a\nthird in France in 1820. They contain the names, authors, editions, dates,\n&c. of over 300 works relating to America. Robertson has given a list of\nnearly as many, which he pretends to have consulted, although he neglected\nwhat they tell us. Humboldt has also a catalogue of 250 authors, consulted\nby him. In 1831, Aspinwall published his American Library containing 771\nworks; and Warden, in Paris, his own, containing 977 American works with\n133 atlasses and maps.\n\nAll this does not complete the account of books on America; since I have\nseen many omitted in all these catalogues; although I never could meet\nsome mentioned there. I will carefully notice them, that it may be known\nwhere I found my materials, and what may yet have escaped my researches. I\nhave already consulted upwards of 600 writers on both Americas, and there\nare at least 1000 already printed, I mean special or local works connected\nwith history. If we were to add to these the botanists, naturalists,\npaltry compilers, and pamphlets, we might make a catalogue of 3000 works\non America, her inhabitants and productions.\n\nI will refer gradually to them, and have collected them all in my\nmanuscript illustrations; _materials_, _printed works_. Therefore we do\nnot lack printed materials: but the choice of the best is difficult: since\nmany works merely consist in fables, blunders, errors, hypotheses and\ntheir constant repetitions: which ought to be rejected in order to gather\nfacts and the truth. But we must not reject as pyrrhoniams all that may\nclash with our ideas and systems: it is chiefly needful so recall and\nrestore the events and facts mentioned by the earliest travellers and\nobservers.\n\nThese numerous local writers ought to be divided into three classes. 1.\nhistorians and annalists, 2. travellers and geographers, 3. antiquarians\nand philologists. I shall now merely mention the most useful (which I have\nall consulted) upon the Peruvian and Austral regions of South America.\n\n1st. The principal historians are, 1. Molina, History of Chili, 2. Funes,\nCivil History of Buenos Ayres, Paraguay and Tucuman, 3. Lavega, History of\nPeru, 4. Debrizoffer, history of Abipones, 5. Charlevoix of Paraguay, 6.\nTecho, on Ditto, 7, 8. Lozano and Jolis on Chaco, 9. Muratori, and 10.\nRenger, Paraguay.\n\n2d. The principal writers who have furnished historical facts, with\ngeographical and ethnographical materials, are _old travellers_, 1.\nPigafetta and Magellan, 2. Cabot, 3. Shmidel, 4. Drake, 5. Cavendish, 6.\nAcarete, 7. Knivet, 8. Frezier, 9. Sepp, 10. Brewer, 11. Nyel, 12.\nSchmidtmeyer.\n\n_The modern travellers are_, 1. Azara, 2. D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Ulloa, 3. Humboldt, 4. Cook,\n5. Byron, 6. Laperouse, 7. Stevenson, 8. Myers, 9. Heyn, 10. Beaumont, 11.\nGillespie, 12. Vidal, 13. Wedel, 14. King, 15. Morrell, 16. Andrew, 17.\nTemple, 18. Mawe, 19. Proctor, 20. Graham, 21. Head, 22. Pernetty.\n\nThe principal original geographers and ethnographers are, 1. Fernandez on\nChiquitos 1726, 2. Bueno, Ditto 1800, 3. Falkner, on Patagonia 1774, 4.\nMolina on Chili and Cuyo, 5. Lozano on Chaco 1733, 6. Skinner, Memoirs on\nPeru, 7. Gili, South America 1782.\n\n3d. Lastly the auxiliary writers on philology, antiquities and other\nhistorical branches are, 1. Adelung, Vater, Maltebrun, Balbi, &c., on all\nAmerican languages, 2. American researches of Humboldt, Macculoh 1829.\nThose of Depaw and Ranking are shameful, perverting every thing to support\nfalse systems.\n\n_Manuscripts._ There are yet many such extant on America, in the libraries\nof both hemispheres. Clavigero gave a long list of Mexican Manuscripts.\nFunes quotes several on Austral America. There are several extant in\nCentral America and South America, in Peru and Brazil. Many have been lost\nthrough wilful neglect, or destroyed at the Spanish Conquest, the\nexpulsion of Jesuits, &c. Those in the ancient languages, Mexican,\nTarasca, Tzendal, &c., are now very rare, and much esteemed. Those burnt\nby Zumaraga, the Mexican Omar, have been often regretted. Lord Kingborough\nhas lately published some at a great cost.\n\nThe manuscripts which I could consult on South America are but few. Those\non North America are more numerous and very important; particularly the\ntraditions of the Linapis, Shawanis, &c., they are chiefly on wood, bark,\nskins or Mosaic strings. But I have received several manuscript\nvocabularies of the languages of Guyana, Brazil, Texas, Mexico, &c. and I\nhave consulted several manuscripts in the libraries of Philadelphia.\n\nThere are, besides, in the public or private libraries of all the great\ncities of both Americas, several interesting historical works, which have\nnever been published.\n\nThere are several in Philadelphia, particularly the historical collections\nof Simetierre. Often the best or most important works cannot be printed:\nwhile a crowd of paltry compilations are ushered to deceive the public.\nThis may be deemed a remainder of the prevailing ignorance and error.\nInstead of appreciating the learned and useful works, the prevailing taste\nis for historical romances and systematic fables. It is needful to seek\nthese previous labors, which run the risk of being totally lost, if we\nwill not have again to blush hereafter for these historical losses.\n\nI give the list of such among my own manuscripts, as have been employed to\nwrite this history. They are yet in my possession, but I wish to see them\ndeposited in a great public library; where they might be consulted.\n\n1. Materials for the history, ethnography, &c. of the Americans, their\nannals, chronology, &c. 40 books, begun in 1820, continued ever since, and\nnot yet closed.\n\n2. Vocabularies of the ancient and modern languages of both Americas,\nsymbols, glyphs, &c., 4 books, begun 1824.\n\n3. Comparative geography and ethnography of ancient and modern America, 5\nbooks, with maps, &c., begun 1824.\n\n4. Ancient monuments of North and South America, compared with the\nprimitive monuments of the eastern hemisphere, 3 books and 200 plans, &c.,\n1822.\n\n5. TELLUS, or the primitive History of the Earth and Mankind in Protholia,\nOceania and Neotholia, with the ancient and modern general ethnography, 30\nbooks, begun in 1821.\n\n6. Synglosson, or compared examination of all languages and nations, 6\nbooks, begun 1825.\n\n7. Iconographical Illustrations of all my historical works and travels,\ncontaining over 1000 maps, plans, views, costumes, portraits, alphabets,\nsymbols, implements, &c., in 10 cartoons, begun 1816.\n\n8. Travels in North America, in 1802, 3, 4, and from 1815 to 1835. In many\nmanuscript books and journals.\n\nI have often been apprehensive of the fate of Boturini, for these\ninteresting manuscript and long researches. This has happened already for\none of my manuscripts. As early as 1825 I sent to the Academy of Science\nin Boston, a manuscript of 240 pages, being an _account of the materials\nyet existing for the history of the nations and tribes of America before\nColumbus_. This was for an offered prize of $100: which was never awarded,\nalthough my memoir was declared the best sent. And instead of depositing\nthis manuscript in the library of the American Antiquarian Society as\nrequested, it has been _lost_ or _stolen_. If never recovered, and that\nthe public may judge of the merits of it, at such an early period of my\nhistorical studies: I will state the principal results of my enquiries\ntherein; which tenor, together with their length, were the ostensible\nreasons for not awarding a prize probably never meant to be awarded.\n\nI therein proved in 1825, 1st. that there are yet materials enough,\nnotwithstanding the loss of many, for an ancient history of America.\n\n2. That a complete American history ought to employ and combine all the\nmaterials afforded by geology, geography, physics, chronology, physiology,\nethnology, archeology, philology, on America, with all the traditions of\nthe Americans.\n\n3. Geology and physical geography indicates the cradles and ancient\nsettlements of mankind, the revolutions of nature, the places unfit for\npopulation, the means of access, probable route of colonies, &c.\n\n4. America has an ancient geography previous to 1492, which ought to be\nrestored.\n\n5. The coincidence of names of nations and tribes, afford a comparitive\nconcordance, indicating ancient connections or identity.\n\n6. The ancient American population, must have been derived from the\nnearest shores of Africa, Europe and Asia. The points where all the\nindications and traditions tend, are the Antilles, next Paria and Guyana\nin South America; Anian or Tollan and Alaska in the N. W with Sucanunga or\nGroenland to the N. E.\n\n7. The philological solution of historical affinities must be sought in\nthe roots of the languages, their conformity or analogies, the number of\nsimilar sounds, roots and words; which are susceptible of a mathematical\ncalculation, and referable to the theory of probabilities.\n\n8. Many primitive nations in all parts of the earth, may thus be proved to\nhave been akin or related.\n\n9. Noah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flood was nearly general; but perhaps not universal. His ark or\nTHBE was perhaps Thibet: and his 3 sons 3 nations saved there.\n\n10. It has been proved that all the antidiluvian patriarchs were Nations,\ntheir long ages being the duration of dynasties or states. This opinion\nmay also be entertained of many other ancient patriarchs or heads of\ntribes, every where, by the usual figure of personification.\n\n11. Peleg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flood was volcanic, not so general as Noah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. There may have\nbeen many successive cataclysms blended in this, as this has been often\nmistaken in date for Noah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\n\n12. The cradle of the Tulans or Mexican nations, must have been the Tulan\nof Asia, since Turan and Tartary. There are many places called Tula, all\nover the earth, indicating settlements of Atlantes.\n\n13. The ancient chronology of America may be restored. Several dates\ngiven, a system proposed.\n\n14. All the races and complexions of mankind are found in America.\n\n15. America was known to the ancient nations, particularly the Atlantes,\nPelagians, Phenicians, &c.\n\n16. Some highlands of America were not covered at Noah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flood, and might\nbecome the azylums of men, animals, and vegetation. However, but few\nnations can be traced to these azylums in America.\n\n17. The ancient monuments of both Americas, are similar to the primitive\nmonuments of Asia, Africa and Europe.\n\n18. The ancient inscriptions of America can be explained. A key may be\nfound for all: some are evidently pelagic.\n\n19. The religions of the Americans, were similar to the primitive\nreligions of the eastern hemisphere.\n\n20. The manners and customs, of the Americans, are very various, and form\nno peculiar test.\n\n21. Many American nations were highly civilized, besides the Mexicans and\nPeruvians: skilful in agriculture, and the arts, having cattle, colleges,\n&c.\n\nMy reward for having ascertained and proved those facts, was to be denied\nthe prize, and to have my manuscript mislaid or lost or stolen! My\nhistorical researches ever since have continued to confirm nearly all\nthese facts.(1)\n\n2. _Documents and monuments._ The historical titles and proofs,\ninscriptions, medals, coins, charters, &c., which are so common elsewhere,\nare but few as yet, in America, belonging to early times: most belong to\nmodern history.\n\nThere are some ancient inscriptions scattered in South America; but not\nyet published. Molina speaks of one on a pyramid of Cuyo, which late\ntravellers have not found. Those of Otolum near Palenqu\u00c3\u00a9 in Central\nAmerica begin to excite great attention; and I have sought a key for\nthem.(2)\n\nAncient metallic coins and medals, really Americans, are exceedingly\nscarce: yet there are some in Central America. Several medals, perhaps\nforeign and indicating a communication, have been found, but again lost or\nneglected; few have been figured or explained.\n\nImplements, tools, sculptures, objects of arts, pottery, weapons, &c. of\nthe ancient Americans are found in all the museums; but excite little\nattention, by not being concentrated, accumulated nor classified. Many\nfine specimens of arts have been melted, or broken and lost. The\nastronomical stones of the Mexicans and Muyzcas have been preserved; but\nthose of Peru and Central America are lost; as well as that beautiful one\nof the Talegas of North America, a dodecagone, with 144 hieroglyphic\nsigns, found in the Ohio, and once kept in a museum of Philadelphia.\n\nThe ancient monuments of both Americas, are very numerous, indicating a\ndense population in places since become wild and desolate, as in North\nAmerica, Guyana, Brazil, &c. They are most numerous in the central parts\nof both Americas, and lessen towards both ends. Yet they are met from lat.\n45 N. to 45 S. They are very variable in different parts; by no means\nidentic, indicating different builders or many degrees of civilization,\nfrom the rudest arts to the most refined: employing many materials, earth,\nclay, gravel, stone, wood, unbaked bricks; being either irregular\ncyclopian structures, or regular buildings of rough or cut stones, _piz\u00c3\u00a9_\nor beaten clay, &c.\n\nWe do not know as yet one half of those in existence, and many have never\nbeen described nor figured. Yet they afford every where, one of the most\nevident and certain base of historical researches, confirming traditions,\nor revealing the seats of former empires, their civilization, &c. They\nconsist chiefly in mounds, altars, tumuli or tombs, ruined cities,\nvillages and forts, temples and dwellings; but we find besides in various\nplaces, traces of ancient palaces, bridges, roads, causeways, canals,\nmines, dromes, baths, pyramids, towers, pillars, rocking stones, walls,\nwells, pits &c. They generally resemble the primitive monuments of the\nsame kind, met with in the eastern hemisphere, from England and Ireland to\nMauritania and Africa, extending east to Lybia, Syria, Russia, Persia,\nTartary, &c. They have less resemblance with the monuments of Egypt,\nGreece, Rome, India and China; yet some kinds somewhat assimilate. In\nfact, there are, throughout both Americas, three very distinct classes of\nmonuments, indicating distinct arts and architecture.\n\nThe first or rudest, assimilate nearly to those yet used by the rudest\ntribes in the north or in Brazil, Antilles, &c., indicating a similar\nbarbarous state.\n\nThe second or primitive, is known by using wood and earth instead of\nstones for buildings.\n\nThe third or most refined, employed stones, often well cut as in Mexico,\nCentral America, Peru, &c., and indicates arts nearly equal to those of\nEgypt and India.\n\nBesides such great monumental remains; there are lesser antiquities;\nfragments of sculpture, statues, idols, painting, Mosaic, &c., either in\nmetals, stones, pottery, beads, &c., found every where mixed with the\nothers.\n\nBut the most singular and dubious relics of antiquity, are subteraneous or\nin excavations: these are in caves, mines, pits, &c.: while under ground\nare found trees, stumps, charcoal, ashes, shells, pavements, walls,\nhouses, &c. that must have been buried by alluvions, diluvions or new\nformed soil. It has been surmised or ascertained that some may be\nantidiluvian: although those in deep alluvial soils, near streams, and\nconnected with graves, may have been buried by men, or fluvial\ninundations. Mummies, skeletons and bones, with human apparel and\nimplements have been found in caves, evidently buried there by human\nmeans, and not by floods. Human remains are but seldom if ever connected\nwith the organic remains of the soil and caves, even of the latest\ngeological date.\n\n3. _Geography, Maps, &c._ The knowledge of the regions and localities\ninhabited by mankind, or where colonies are sent, empires founded, is\nneedful to history, in order to understand and treat the events and\nmigrations. The physical configuration of the land, the climates, plains,\nmountains and streams, have a great influence on civilization and\ncommunications. Physical geography is constant and invariable: while civil\nor ethnographical geography is constantly fluctuating in limits and names.\n\nIf we had complete series of maps by chronological order upon America; we\nshould find therein the materials for a comparative historical geography,\nand successive ethnography, showing the gradual revolutions of mankind.\nThe old maps of America, those of Laet, the old geographers &c. are very\nvaluable for this object. Many travellers in America, have given original\nmaps, which furnish similar materials. I have chiefly used for Peru and\nAustral America, the maps of Laet, Acarete, D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Anville, Molina, Falkner,\nCochrane, Wedel, the Jesuits, &c. Among the modern general maps, relating\nto South America, the Spanish maps of 1810 and 1822, the English of 1815,\nthe French of 1830, the latest American of Tanner, &c. By those materials\nI have been able to trace and fix four periods of American geography, 2\nancient and 2 modern.\n\nI. Primitive geography of America.\n\nII. Ancient ditto, or between 1400 and 1500.\n\nIII. Modern colonial geography.\n\nIV. Modern independent geography.\n\nI have formed Mpt. maps of the two first periods, which shall be published\ngradually, or in my Illustrations of the Ancient Geography of America. We\nhave thousands of maps on the early geography of the Eastern Hemisphere,\nand no one as yet on the Western Hemisphere! to show the respective limits\nand positions of Ancient Empires, Nations, Cities, &c., except Clavigero\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nmap of Anahuac at the Spanish conquest, those of Hayti, Laet, &.c.\n\nWe have the plans of Ancient Mexico and Cuzco; but lack those of\nTiahuanaco, Otolum, and many more important for ancient history. Several\nplans of ancient sites of civilization have been given, along with those\nof monuments. I have many in Mpt. yet unpublished. The greatest part of\nmodern cities, are built on ancient sites, from Mexico to Chili. In North\nAmerica, the same happens with Cincinnati, Louisville, Pittsburg, St.\nLouis, Philadelphia, Savannah, &c. The views of ruined cities, and those\nof actual cities, are partly historical, connected with the knowledge of\ngradual American civilization.\n\nMany ancient names of islands, lakes, streams and mountains, are preserved\nin actual names. Such are Cuba, Hayti\u00e2\u0080\u0094Ontario, Erie, Titicaca\u00e2\u0080\u0094Ohio,\nAlatamaha, Maranon, Parana, Rivers.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Alleghanies, Andes, Parima, Mountains,\n&c. When the names have been changed, it is the duty of the historical\ngeographer to compare the old and new names.\n\nThe Mexicans and other civilized ancient nations, could draw and paint\nmaps. Even our North American tribes can draw rude maps on skins or bark.\nSome of these are preserved in museums; but none have ever been published:\nalthough some are pretty correct and deserving it.\n\n4. _Natural Sciences._ They are now becoming sisters of history. Geology\nis connected with geography. Botany and Zoology, acquaint us with trees,\nplants and animals, which were used in the arts and agriculture at\ndifferent periods. The Asiatic origin of maize, called _maza_ by Hesiod\nand known to the Pelagians (Hughes Greece,) has been unperceived by\nHumboldt and many others, although it throws some light on the early\nmigrations and communications of tribes. Maize was cultivated in Assyria,\nWest Tartary, North Africa and Java, before 1492, as asserted by Marco\nPolo, Crawford, Raffles. Gebelin, &c.(3)\n\nAmerica had anciently several cereal plants, besides maize, two kinds of\nindigenous wheat and barley in Chili. The Quinoa and Zizania, the rice of\nSouth and North America. Many roots, beans, seeds, fruits and flowers,\nwere cultivated from Canada to Chili. Native dies were abundant, the\nindigo and annato were natives. Red and yellow cochineal were nursed and\ncollected. Many peculiar kinds of cotton, silks, hemp, flax, agave, palm,\n&c., were cultivated or collected to use for cloths, threads, ropes, &c.\n\nPaleontology, a new science, seeks for the remains of animals dwelling on\nearth, before mankind. America has already afforded the huge mastodons,\nelephants, megatherium, megalonyx, as primitive land animals, and many\nlarge reptiles, crocodiles of streams and lakes.\n\nAmerican Zoology is very peculiar: a few arctic quadrupeds, birds and\ninsects excepted; all the animals of this hemisphere are peculiar to it.\nReptiles almost entirely such, even in the North. All the American monkeys\nform distinct species. The tropical animals of the two hemispheres are\ndistinct, even often in genera. Out of 33 quadrupeds formerly domesticated\nin America, the dog only may be deemed a stranger: and it had even many\nAmerican varieties.\n\nThe domestic quadrupeds of ancient America were 33, while only 25 in Asia,\nAfrica and Europe. Among them were 4 species of Vicunia, 4 of Agutis, 2\ndeer, 2 hogs, 10 monkeys, &c. See my dissertation on the domestic animals\nof both hemispheres, 1832. Americans had also tamed 22 birds or fowls, as\nmany as Asia, &c., and even some reptiles, fishes, insects, &c., had\nbecome domestic: altogether 112 in America and only 80 in Europe, Asia,\n&c., before 1492.\n\nAmerican botany offers many peculiar regions; in the North only, akin to\nAsiatic or European botany; but becoming quite distinct in the tropics,\nstill more so in Austral America. Since 1492 the European colonists have\nbrought many plants, that are become spontaneous from Canada to Chili:\nthese must be carefully separated from the ancient indigenous plants.\n\nThe American Floras are nearly as many as the 15 natural regions already\nindicated, each having a focal seat or cradle in some range of mountains.\nThey become richer or more abundant in species within the tropics,\ndecreasing to the North and South. Trees and palm abound there, and\ndisappear near the poles, the palms are unknown beyond the 36 degrees\nNorth and South. The equator has 500 species of trees; in latitude 40 N.\nand S. only 100 kinds are found, or even less. Social plants and grasses\nabound in plains, and in the North dwindle to mosses and lichens.\n\nTrees were early tools of civilization, affording timber, fuel, dies,\nhouses, boats, weapons, &c. Fruit trees afforded food in abundance: even\nthe tribes of North America near latitude 40 d. had 40 kinds of native\nwild fruits, and had begun to plant orchards of plumtrees, peachtrees,\ncrab-trees, nut-trees. They knew how to make oils of nuts, to dry the\nfruits, make sugars out of maples and other trees.\n\nFish has always afforded an ample supply of food to early nations, whence\nthe preference to dwell near streams, Lakes and shores. Notwithstanding\nthe swimming rambles of fishes, it is only the pelagic or oceanic tribes\nof them that are common to both hemispheres. Most of the resident shore\nfishes of America are peculiar species. Still more so with lacustral and\nfluviatile fishes. These are divided into peculiar regions. Our northern\nlakes form one; and almost every large stream has a peculiar generation of\nfinny tribes: such are the Mississippi, Maranon, Parana, the Atlantic\nstreams and rivers, those of Brazil, &c.\n\nMinerals abound in both Americas. It was gold and silver that drew hither\nthe greedy Spanish freebooters. The civilized nations knew mining,\nsmelting, casting and forging. They used gold, silver, copper, brass,\nlead, &c.; collected and prized gems, emeralds, agats, volcanic glass, &c.\nEven the less civilized tribes of North America used copper and lead,\nclays for pipes, pottery, &c. Iron was scarce because so hard to melt, and\nhighly prized; but iron-rings have been found as jewels around the wrists\nof skeletons.\n\nMetallic coins were little known except in Central America; but bits of\nsilver, gold, tin, iron, were used as such. The other mediums of exchange\nwere skins, mats, nuts, cacao, shells, beads, mosaic works, &c. Commerce\nwas well known to many nations; traders went 500 miles to exchange\ncommodities in Florida, Mexico, Yucatan, Peru, &c. Navigators went by sea\nfor the same purpose all over the Antilles, coast of Peru, and in the\ngreat streams. It is thus that were found many strange and foreign\nobjects, jewels, medals, metals, &c., all over America, and in early\ntombs.\n\n5. _Ethnography._ This new science which undertakes to describe nations,\nreckons already many peculiar branches. Anthropography or the knowledge of\nphysical mankind. Philology or the comparative study of human speech and\nlanguages. Besides the nameless branch attending to the moral ideas, arts,\ninstitutions, manners, civilization, governments and religions of mankind;\nwhich might be called moral ethnography.\n\nAll these studies become the philosophy of history, and shall duly command\nmy attention. Some writers neglect them altogether; others, like\nRobertson, do not know how to collect and accumulate facts instead of\nsystems: Rollin has shown in his Ancient History, how useful moral\nethnography may be as an auxiliary: although he omitted philology and\nphysical facts.\n\nI have studied the men of all the parts of the world, in order to know and\ncompare them, better than had been done. All the errors on the histories\nof nations, proceed commonly from the slender or partial views acquired or\nadmitted by the writers. There is much to glean on the ethnography of\nmodern nations, and therefrom we may ascend to ancient ethnography. It\nwould be needful to study well the physical and moral features of all; the\nshapes of bodies, skulls, faces and limbs; the complexions of the skin,\nhairs and eyes; with the casual or permanent varieties.\n\nBut, above all, we must better study all the spoken languages and\ndialects. It is strange that we hardly know anything, and sometimes\nnothing at all, on the languages of many existing tribes, with whom we\nhave intercourse in both Americas. It would be desirable to procure at\nleast a vocabulary of 100 essential words, in each. Such words, including\nthe cardinal numbers, will soon become the key of ethnographical\nphilology. While the additional study of phonology or sounds of languages,\ntheir idioms and grammars, their roots, and verbs, the alphabets, glyphs\nand symbols used to communicate ideas, will combine to furnish the\ncomplete knowledge of philology as a separate science. Although I have not\nalways carried so far my researches; I did so for a few, applying chiefly\nmyself to the essential features of languages; and the unexpected results\nwill be surprising.\n\nAmerican anthropography will teach that there were men of all sizes,\nfeatures and complexions, in this hemisphere before 1492: notwithstanding\nthe false assertions of many writers, who take one nation for the whole\nAmerican group. The Uskihs, the Puruays, the Parias, the Chons, &c. were\nas white as the Spaniards, 50 such tribes were found in South America;\nwhile many tribes of Choco, the Manabis, the Yaruras, &c., were as black\nas negroes. All the other shades of brown, tawny and coppery, were\nscattered every where. There was not a single red man in America, unless\npainted such. Some tribes had scanty beards as the Tartars, Chinese,\nBerbers, &c., others bushy beards. The Tinguis or Patagons were 7 or 8\nfeet high, and the Guaymas only 4 or 5 feet.\n\n6. _Traditions and Annals._ Many American nations preserve a memory of\nhistorical events by unwritten traditions, repeated from fathers to sons;\nor communicated orally by the priests, chiefs or elderly men. Many are\npreserved yet to this day, by frequent repetitions, being embodied in\nsongs, hymns, maxims, tales, drawings, or even symbolic figures and signs.\nMany of those traditions are precious for history, notwithstanding the\nfables, allegories, metaphors, personifications, &c., which partly conceal\nthem or render the meaning obscure. We must learn to decipher them as we\ndo old inscriptions and medals.\n\nAlthough many such are now nearly lost for us, by the extinction of the\nliving books, who kept the remembrance: there are many already collected,\nand of which we ought to make a good use. But there are as many more,\nwhich have never been collected nor printed. I have collected many such in\nNorth America in manuscript. It often happens that the American tribes\nwill not communicate them to their foes or oppressors; but their friends\nand allies may hope to receive the deposit of them. Every enlightened\ntraveller ought to seek for them wherever he goes. Yet after being\nacquired, they are sometimes lost again, by neglect. I have known some\nlearned and unlearned men despise them equally as _Indian Stories_,\nbecause they despise the ancient American race. There are, however, as yet\nmany historical songs, poems and tales to collect among all the American\ntribes, which falling in good hands cannot fail to attract notice and be\nemployed usefully. Every one who neglects or destroys them acts as a\nvandal. Malcolm has said at the outset of his history of Persia, that we\nought never to neglect the original notions of a people on its origin, or\nearly history, since therein is found the germ and spring of their\nsubsequent conduct, actions and opinions.\n\nMy illustrations shall contain many unpublished or forgotten traditions,\nwhereof I shall avail myself in all my historical annals and researches. I\nconsider those of the Uskihs, Dinnis, Ongwis, Linapis, Shawanis, Cados,\nNatchez, Ozages, Atakapas, Apalachians, &c., as highly important for the\nannals of North America. The same may be said of the Mexicans, Zapotecas,\nMayas, Toltecas, Chols, &c., for Central America. Of the Haytians, Cubans\nand Caribs for the Antilles. And in South America those of the Muyzcas,\nCumanans, Tamanacs, Popayans, Peruvians, Chilians, Brazilians, Abipons,\n&c.\n\n7. _Chronology and Astronomy._ These two sciences always go together, and\nform a double key of history. The American chronology is by no means fixed\nbefore 1492, and requires a skillful hand to preserve and compare all the\nheterogenous dates heretofore collected. I shall attempt to elucidate it\ngradually; but may often be compelled, as in geology, to relate only\nsuccessive events without dates, and merely referred to a series of\ngradual facts. In Austral America, we are told that none had notions of\nastronomy and dates, except the Chilians; yet their chronology begins only\nin 1450. I doubt this: I rather believe that their oral traditions have\nbeen neglected, as well as those of their neighbours.\n\nIn Peru, there are many positive dates, yet I was the first to reduce them\nto chronological order. In Brazil and Guyana, but few dates are found. The\nMuyzcas had very early dates, yet few have been preserved; much obscured\nby personifications of dynasties, and Pietrahita begins their real annals\nonly in 1490, or 45 years before the Spanish invasion. In the Antilles the\ndates are quite loose, and difficult to reduce even to a serial order.\n\nBut in Central and Mexican America, we find many early dates with a\nregular chronology. Yet some are extravagant or contradictory. I shall\nendeavour to elucidate them, so as to reduce the whole to order. They must\nform the base of a regular American chronology, that ascends by dates to\nthe flood and creation. In Yucatan the first regular date only reach to\n940 after Christ.\n\nIn North America, where the smallest number of dates existed; we have\nunexpectedly and quite lately, found that many ancient dates could be\nprocured. Cusick has published those of the Ongwi traditions, and I have\nascertained those of the Linapis. Both of which reach to the flood and\ncreation, and afford series of available dates as early as 1600 years\nbefore our era; thus nearly as ample as those of the TOL-tecas, and as\nplain in some instances.\n\nAstronomy was cultivated by all the civilized nations of ancient America.\nThey had cycles of 144, 104, 60, 52, 20, 15 and 13 solar years. Humboldt\nhas well written on that subject; but much remains to be gleaned. The\nnorthern tribes reckon by generations as the Greeks, the Polynesians, &c.,\nand by winters instead of years, moons instead of solar months. They had\nalso a cycle of 60 years. In Central America, &c. the months were of 20\ndays, including 4 weeks of 5 days. But the Peruvians had months of 27\ndays, or 3 weeks of 9 days as the Etruscans. The Muyzcas small weeks of 3\ndays, &c. No where in ancient America, was found the sabatical week of\ndays, based on the 7 planets and the 4 quarters of a lunation. This is\nremarkable, as evincing a remote antiquity, and separation before this\nweek was adopted in Egypt, India, Syria, Celtica, &c.\n\nUntil 120 years before Christ the TOL-tecas reckoned only 365 days in the\nsolar year, as the primitive nations of Asia: then they added the hours to\nthe year. This forms their astronomical era. The Muyzcas had a very\ncomplicated astronomy, and three kinds of years. The usual was of 20\nmoons, and the ecclesiastical of 37 moons. The horal division unknown in\nmany parts of America, was of 4 hours in the day for the Muyzcas and\nMexicans, elsewhere of 5, 10 and 20. The 24 hours and the Zodiac of 12\nsigns with 360 degrees were not known. The Mexican Zodiac had 13 signs and\n104 degrees.\n\nArithmetic is intimately connected with astronomy. A complete decimal\nnumeration was known to all the civilized American nations, and even to\nthe northern tribes. The most rude tribes reckoned by 5 or the manual\nmode; there are traces also of a binary numeration, the most simple of\nall: while others had complex calculations by 13 and by 20 or scores. We\nfind no trace of any by 7, and but slight indications of a ternary\nnumeration by 3 and 9. All these American modes of reckoning may thus be\nreduced to the _binary_, by two or pairs; and the quinary or manual by the\nfive fingers, of which the decimal is the double, and by 20 the quadruple.\n\n8. _Languages._ They are becoming one of the most important aids in\nhistory. When the annals are ample and clear, the examination of the\nlanguages is merely a supplement to historical knowledge; but when they\nare obscure, mutilated or totally lost; languages then supply more or less\nto their defects or loss. Their comparative study furnish us new lights to\nascertain the origines, parentage, dispersions, colonies, alliances, wars,\n&c., of the nations thus deprived of written annals or even traditions.\nThey serve also to rectify the imperfect annals or the fabulous\ntraditions. This study may lead besides to trace the manners, religions,\nintercourse, arts and sciences of nearly all nations; since the proper\nlanguages of each people offers a picture of the civilization, acquired or\nborrowed knowledge, modes of life, &c. of each.\n\nIt is above all in both Americas that this study is indispensable in\nhistorical researches: I will therefore apply to languages in all cases,\nand make constant use of them; and they will unfold new facts quite\nunknown, although very important, Historical lights shall thereby be\nthrown on many obscure subjects, whence astonishing and unexpected results\nmay spring, in which I shall depend as much as upon mutilated and\nneglectful traditions.\n\nBy taking into view all the American languages or as many as are already\nknown, we shall easily dispel the errors and absurd systems of\nphilosophers and philologists, who taking only a few as samples of the\nwhole, have either deemed _all the Americans_, as many Jews, or Tartars,\nor Atlantes, or sprung from the ground, and so on. Now the fact is that\nthese writers have never taken the trouble to compare the numerous\nAmerican languages and dialects, reduce them to groups, and seek their\naffinities elsewhere.\n\nAdelung and Vater had once stated without proof, that nearly 1200\nlanguages existed in America. Balbi has reduced them to 423, of which 212\nin South America; but they can be much further reduced, most of them being\nmere dialects. The whole may be comprised in 25 groups of languages, or\neven less; which were certainly identic in 25 languages 2 or 3000 years\nago: and all of which have astonishing affinities with the groups of the\neastern hemisphere, so as to indicate a parentage 4 or 5000 years ago.\n\nVater and Maltebrun have given a few hundred examples of such analogies:\nand the systematic writers have supposed that they had exhausted the\ncomparisons. Yet a single language, the Chilian, has by itself more\naffinities with the languages of Europe, than all those mentioned by Vater\nand others, put together! The foreign or transatlantic affinities of\nAmerican languages, vary from 10 to 70 per cent, according to the nations.\nIf we suppose that there are 400 languages in America, and as many in the\neastern hemisphere, and each to have about 2000 roots or essential words\nonly; while the mean affinities are only 25 per cent: we shall find as\nmany as 200,000 affinities! out of America, in every American language;\nand in all the 400, as many as 80 millions! instead of the paltry\nreckoning of 1000 or so. All this is susceptible of mathematical proofs,\nand shall be unfolded gradually in these pages.\n\nThe theory about the common exclusive grammatical structure of all the\nAmerican languages, is equally erroneous and based upon partial facts.\nInstead of all the American languages being polysynthetic by amalgamating\nwords, we find in America many mixt forms, and even the pure monosylabic:\nwhile the amalgamation of words prevails more or less in Europe and\nAfrica; chiefly in the Bask, Italian dialects, Greek, Berber and other\nAtlantic dialects, the Negro languages, those of Caffraria, the Sanscrit\nand all the derived languages.\n\nIt had been asserted that no American language was monosylabic: yet Balbi\nstates that the Guarani and Maya are such; Nasera has lately proved the\nsame of the Othomi. Thus we have at least 3 such American groups of\nlanguages. But there are more; nay many American languages have\nmonosylabic roots, even among the most amalgamated groups.\n\nThe most obvious grammatical classification of American languages, has\nescaped the acuteness of philologists. I find it in the epithetic\nstructure, or relative position of ideas. Under this view all the\nlanguages arrange themselves in three great classes or groups. 1. Regular,\n2. Resupinate, 3. Mixt.\n\n1. _The Regular_ is the most simple and natural form: where the roots or\nnouns are prefixed, and the adjuncts or adjectives, expressing epithetes\nor qualities follow or are added. This group includes in the Eastern\nContinent 1. All the Semetic languages, Arabic, Hebrew, &c. 2. All the\nAtlantic and Egyptian languages. 3. All the Celtic and Cantabrian\nlanguages. 4. All the Polynesian and Malay languages. 5. The Bhotiya and\nmany languages of Thibet. 6. Most of the Negro languages. 7. Yakut of\nSiberia, &c.\n\nIn America this group includes my groups 1. Innuit or Uski. 2. Ongwi. 3.\nCapaha. 4. Chactah. 5. All the languages related thereto in North-west\nAmerica, the Kaluchi, Mandan, &c. 6. All the Guarani languages of South\nAmerica, and perhaps many others, Mayna, Mobima, &c.\n\n2. _The Resupinate or Reflexed Group_: where the roots or nouns\nsubstantive are reversed, following the adjective or epithetes, which are\nprefixed. This second mode of uniting ideas prevails 1. In all the\nlanguages of China and Tartary. 2. In all the Teutonic languages German,\nSwede, English. 3. In most of the Thracian, Illyrian, Greek and Slavonic\nlanguages. 4. In all the Turkish languages of Turan, Bokhara, Turkey. 5.\nThe Newari of Imalaya. 6. The Qua or Hottentot of South Africa.\n\nIn America, it is the most prevailing form, found in my groups 1. Linni or\nLinapis. 2. Otali or Cheroki. 3. In all the Mexican and Othomi languages.\n4. Chontal. 5. Skereh or Pani and Shoshoni, of North America,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and in South\nAmerica. 6. Chili. 7. Yarura. 8. Mbaya and probably many more: although\nhardly indicated by the philologists.\n\n3. _Mixt Form_, which employs or adopts more or less the two former modes;\nalthough there is always a prevailing form, that indicates the original\nmode of uniting ideas. This mixt form appears 1. In the Sanscrit and all\nderived languages. 2. In the Zend and Persian languages of Iran. 3. In the\nPelagic and Italic languages, the Latin, Italian, French, Spanish, Greek.\n4. The Japanese, &c.\n\nWhile in America it is found 1. In the Aruac languages. 2. The Muyzca. 3.\nThe Peruvian languages, &c. of South America, and in North America. 4. The\nAtalan. 5. Mizteca. 6. Opata, and probably some others.\n\nThis comparative classification of languages, will greatly help future\ninvestigations. It will show the improbability of the two opposite modes\nof annexing ideas having been entertained, by the same people at any time;\nwhile the mixt form evinces amalgamations of ancient nations. We have thus\nacquired another clue to trace primitive connections, another available\nmean to pursue the human steps on earth.\n\n9. _Religions and Mythologies._ The human opinions on the past and future\nform every where ample themes of thoughts and actions. From revelations,\ninspirations, oracles, wisdom and priestcraft comingled, have arisen all\nthe worships, and rites, dogmas and creeds, swaying the human mind,\nthrough hope or fear, love or hatred. The history of religious ideas, is\nin fact the history of civilization, since they have sprung together in\nsocial men. Nearly all the religions of Asia (which from hence have spread\nthroughout the earth along with mankind) were found in America: except the\nmodern creeds. But the traces of Judaism and Budhism were very faint and\nlocal. Mahometism was unknown, Braminism hardly known. Christianity or\nsome of its rites are traced to Yucatan only, and may arise from other\nsources. The most prevailing worships were the primitive Sabeism, Solar\nworship, Polytheism, Dualism or Manicheism, Shamanism or worship of\nSpirits, Idolatry, and Fetichism or animal worship. We find throughout\nAmerica many modifications of these creeds: with several complex\nmythologies, more or less analogous to eastern dogmas.\n\nThe investigation of these American religions affords not only an insight\ninto the ancient civilization, but many proofs of ancient communications\nwith Asia or Africa. Throughout North America the Dualism, mythologies and\nfabulous traditions point to a connexion with Tartary. In Florida, Mexico\nand Yucatan, begin to appear the Solar worship, and a cruel idolatry\nforeign to it. This Solar worship appears in a purer form in North\nAmerica, as far as Peru. While in the Antilles, Guyana, Brazil and Chili,\nprevailed several worships of heavenly and terrestial spirits; somewhat\nakin to the primitive idolatry of Africa, Europe, Iran, India, China and\nPolynesia.\n\nAmerican religions admitted, like many others, of Priests, oracles,\ntemples, shrines, pilgrimages, holy places, sacrifices, expiations,\nconfessions, offerings, hymns, veneration for animals, men and stars.\nIdols painted or sculptured in wood, pottery, stone, metals, &c.; bloody\nrites by human sacrifices, scarifications, circumscision, &c. But none of\nthese practices were general, some were quite local and circumscribed.\nThus circumscision was only used by the Mayas of Yucatan, the Calchaquis\nof Tucuman, &c. Traces of a triple god or Indian Trimurti have been met\nfrom Ohio to Peru; but it was no where the prevailing religion. As the\nsame idea was found among the Celts and Polynesians, it may have come by\nthe east rather than Polynesia in the west.\n\n10. _Civilization and Manners._ This completes the history of all nations.\nWhen their annals are well known, it becomes a very proper appendix to\nthem; when they are not, it is a very needful supplement to the\ntraditions, &c. But we must not make any history consist merely in such an\naccount, as often done by negligent writers. The manners and customs of\nevery people, are so fluctuating, liable to be changed, or improved by\ncivilization, imitation, arts and sciences, &c.; that they cannot afford\nany test of connections. They are often borrowed, from neighbors or\nstrangers, disused after awhile by whims or wars, invented to suit the\nclimate and productions it may afford. We have positive proofs that the\nEuropeans have since 1492 greatly modified the customs of all the tribes\nthey conquered or visited. This must have happened formerly also, by other\nvisits or communications. Yet, notwithstanding the uncertainty of the\norigin and duration of the primitive American customs, they must be\nstudied, as one of the sources and objects of history.\n\nWe find, in ancient America, nearly all the forms of social civilization\nand manners of the east. But the Nomadic life with camels, oxen and sheep,\nwas unknown, as well as those animals. The American cattle or lamas, &c.\nof South America, hogs of Coriana, dogs and rabbits of Mexico, deers of\nFlorida, buffalos of Taos, were kept by sedentary civilized tribes. The\nNomadic wandering tribes of America were chiefly hunters and fishermen:\nscattered around the agricultural nations, spreading from Canada to Chili.\n\nAll the kinds of governments were known in America: Theocracy, despotism,\nmonarchy, oligarchy, and democracy. But the most prevailing were theocracy\namong the civilized nations, oligarchy among the barbarous nations: with\ntwo peculiar modifications, of double kings as among Arabs, civil and\nmilitary; and chiefs of families or tribes, as among all primitive\nnations. Queens were known to but few tribes, although the female line was\noften hereditary. Written laws and codes were known to the Tol-tecas,\nMexicans, Mayans, Muyzcas, Panos, Peruvians, &c. Oral laws were elsewhere\npreserved by priests or magistrates.\n\nPolygamy prevailed among some tribes or castes, but was not universal. The\n4 castes of Indians are distinctly found in nearly all the civilized\nnations, often modified into priests, nobles, vassals and slaves. The arts\nof music, medicine, smithery, painting, sculpture, architecture,\nagriculture, pottery, &c., were well known to nearly all. The sciences of\ngeometry, geography, botany, astronomy, &c., were cultivated from Mexico\nto Peru, even taught in schools and colleges; with the arts, the laws, the\nrites, and history of the country.\n\nMarsden has well distinguished several degrees of civilization in Asia. If\nno American nation had reached the Greeks and Romans, or our modern\npolished and improved civilization; it is not extraordinary. But the\nPeruvians, Muyzcas, Tol-tecas, Mexicans, Talascas, &c., were nearly equal\nto the Chinese, Egyptians and Hindus in civilization; not far removed from\nthe European civilization of the 15th century: nay, in some things\nsuperior. The second degree of American civilization found in Chili,\nFlorida, Cumana, the Antilles, Popayan, the Linapis, Omaguas &c. was equal\nto that of the Arabs, Malays, Celts, Cantabrians, Pelagians, &c. While the\nthird degree found in all the barbarous nations, Innuit or Esquimaux,\nShoshonis, Caribs, Brazilians, &c. was not worse than what we find among\nthe Fins, Laplanders, Tartars, Sames, Negroes and Hottentots.\n\nIndividual property in land was almost unknown in America; but feodal and\ntribal property well understood. Common property of tribes and villages\nover their territories, was the most usual tenure, modified by wars,\nconquests, tributes. Individual property existed only for tenements and\npersonal property. Warfares, marriages and funerals were very different in\nevery nation. The weapons of war were clubs, arrows, darts, lances, axes,\nMacana swords, Sarbacanes or blowing tubes, slings, nooses, thronged\nballs, &c. as elsewhere. There was a peculiar diplomacy, with heralds,\nenvoys, messengers. Shields, towers, forts, walls, ditches, were used for\ndefence, besides _Estopils_ a peculiar quilted armor. Flags, banners, and\nstandards were known. The calumets, leaves or green feathers, council\nfires, and white flags were emblems of peace. Alliances and confederations\nexisted from earliest times, also the adoption of tribes and prisoners.\nSlavery was hardly known; but vassalage much extended over conquered\ntribes.\n\nDresses and ornaments were quite various. Seal skins used by the Innuit.\nDeer skins and furs by the tribes of North America. In tropical America\nmany tribes went nearly naked, with a mere apron or pagne of cotton or\ngrass cloth. But the civilized nations were decently clothed with cotton\nshirts and feather mantles. The _Poncho_ is a true American dress known\nfrom Mexico to Chili, hardly known out of America except Polynesia.(4)\n\nWomen wore long pagnes or gowns. They made cloths of lama wool in Peru; of\ncotton, hemp, nettles, grass, feathers &c. there and elsewhere; either\ntwisted, plaited or woven. The Peruvians and Chilians had a peculiar loom\nand plough. Cotton looms were used in Florida, Mexico, and all over South\nAmerica, even by the Caribs to make hamacs or hanging beds. Among some\nnations women had the most labor to perform; yet even the men assumed\nhunting, making canoes, huts, weapons, &c. More civilized tribes worked\ntogether in the fields: The proud and warlike employed vassals or slaves.\n\nPainting the body or face, was usual among many nations, but not general.\nIt was useful against heat and flies, or was used to inspire love or\nterror. Ornaments to the head, ears, nose, lips, wrists, legs, &c., were\nmore or less adopted by men and women. The hair was usually worn long; but\nmany tribes cut it in various ways, as a crown or tuft. The beard even\nwhen scanty was deemed unbecoming by many tribes, and totally eradicated;\nbut some tribes wore beards. The head was often left uncovered; but hats\nwere worn in the N. W. and Central America, turbans in Paria and Florida,\nfeather crowns in the tropics, _Lautas_ or diadem-bands in Peru and the\nAndes. Shoes and gloves were unknown; but sandals, leggings, leather\nclods, and mocassins or slippers of various substances, commonly used;\nwith singular snow shoes of bark in winter by northern tribes.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\n    AMERICAN CATACLYSMS _or Considerations on the Periods of American\n    Geogony, Ontogony, Floods, and ancient population &c. of both\n    Americas._\n\n\nHistory does not merely consist in accumulating facts: these constitute\nthe annals of empires; but the real philosophical history has a nobler\naim. It seeks results, teaches lessons of wisdom, brands with infamy the\nfoes of mankind, and inspires veneration for the benefactors of the human\nrace. It presents examples worthy to be followed, and records the crimes\nto be avoided.\n\nThe several departments of history that are distinguished as biography,\ncivil and ecclesiastical annals, moral and physical surveys of mankind,\ncomparative philology, archeology, chronology, mythology, &c. All combine\nto instruct and amuse, to record the past and present, and to lead to\nbetter future actions, an improved social order. The nations often forget\nthe wise lessons of time and experience; but they are continually recalled\nto memory and view by the historians, who seek the truth, and setting\naside the sway of human passions or national prejudices, present the\nfaithful mirror of history to the eyes of posterity.\n\nSuch is my aim. American history has been so much despised or perverted,\nthat few lessons, have been drawn from it: yet it affords ample scope for\nreflection, study and admiration. Nearly one half of the habitable globe,\nduring all the past ages, cannot fail to offer a variety of subjects, to\ndraw the attention of philosophy, wisdom and philanthropy: that mutual\nbenevolence of mankind, which ought ever to be felt; but is so often\ndiscarded or forgotten through the contrary tendencies of pride, lust,\ncupidity, and all the baneful passions.\n\nThe connections of historical facts with all the sciences, afford another\nuseful theme; that may vastly increase our comparative knowledge: much of\nit has arisen, besides observation, from accurate comparison, analysis and\ngeneralization, which combine to give results, enlarging the field and\nsphere of human knowledge, in all its branches.\n\nIf we go back, by the help of geology, to the most remote periods of\nexistence and life in this hemisphere, we find it like the remainder of\nthe globe, immersed under the Ocean. There, in the depths of the briny\nwaves, the actual rocks now supporting the dry soil, were formed and\nmatured: superposed and intermingled by aquatic and volcanic phenomena and\ncataclysms, if not by superadded aerial depositions. Then were formed the\nprimitive strata of America, ere life had begun to vivify the waters; then\nwere cast the Porphyries, Granites, Shales, Basalts, and other primitive\nor volcanic rocks, that are now chiefly found in Boreal and Western\nAmerica, the Andes, Mts. Parima, and Brazil, the Austral and Boreal\nIslands, Hayti and the Antilles. This was the first period of terrestial\nCreation.\n\nAfter this period of unknown length, began the epocha of aquatic life;\nwhen the breath of GOD, moving on the waters, gave life and motion to\norganized aquatic beings; 1. Plants and Fucites, 2. Spongites and\nAlcyonites, 3. Polyps and corals, 4. Worms and radials, 5. Sluggs and\nshells, 6. Mollusca and Cephalopodes, 7. Trilobites and Crustacites....\nAll incipient vegetating beings, or inferior unbony animals, gradually\nevolved and born in the waters of the Sea.... Followed by the more perfect\nvertebrated aquatic animals, 8. Fishes and Sharks, 9. Snakes and reptiles;\nlastly, 10. Seals and whales. Some of which require shallow water, to\ndwell and breed.... This was the second period of American Creation:\n_Aquatic life_.\n\nThe third epocha is that of the destruction of aquatic life, by cataclysms\nand depositions, submarine volcanic cavernous eruptions or other causes,\nthrowing suddenly in a soft, sandy or muddy state, the substances that\nhave formed the secondary mountains or strata of psamites, argillites,\ncalcarites, carbonites, &c., that overwhelmed the aquatic tribes in their\nway; which becoming therein entombed as living medals of this globe,\ndeclare to us these mighty successive cataclysms or floods of sand, clay,\nlime and coal; now met in vast regions, the Alleghanies and Central North\nAmerica, Florida and the Bahama Islands; the hills and plains of Brazil,\nChili, East Peru, and Central Maragnon.... This was the second period of\nterrestrial formation in America, the third of successive eventful\nperiods.\n\nThe fourth must have been the rise of the land above the waters, if not\nalready partly begun. The epocha of terrestrial upheaving and distortion\nof strata, by an awful inward force; either volcanic, or calorific, or of\ngrowing crystalization; forming mountains and islands, raising them above\nthe Ocean; to become the nucleus of future Continents. The American\nhemisphere had then probably two great islands, in the North and South,\nwith many smaller islands between them, in the tropical sea: the Alleghany\nand Atlantis forming two others in the east, and many others studding the\ntwo polar regions. The insulated mountain tract between Lake Nicaragua and\nthe long valley of Choco, must then have formed another Island of the\nAntilles. Guyana or Parima was also another large island: while Brazil was\na vast peninsula attached to the Andes. I have endeavored to express this\nfirst configuration of America in my two maps of North and South America;\nwhen the Ocean was yet about 500 feet higher than it is actually. Whether\nthis cataclysm was contemporaneous throughout, or by successive throes\nmust be ascertained by Geogony.... This was the fourth period of\nterrestrial events in this hemisphere; but the first of terrestrial\nseparate existence.\n\nWhen the dry land had appeared, the creative power of GOD exerted upon the\nvirgin mould of the mountains, drew forth into life, Plants and Flowers,\nTrees and Palms; with the successive terrestrial animals, 1. Worms and\nSlugs, 2. Insects and Spiders, 3. Snakes and Reptiles, 4. Birds and Fowls,\n5. Beasts and Bats. Streams began to flow, valleys were excavated in the\nsoft or yielding strata by heavy tides and powerful streams: then the\nfishes of the sea ascended the rivers, and filled the streams and lakes. A\nfew shell and other aquatic animals sent also colonies into fresh\nwaters.... This was the fifth period of terrestrial events; that of\nterrestrial life.\n\nMeantime the land was continuing to rise, or the ocean to sink; the dry\nsoil was extending: land volcanoes began to appear in the Andes and\nelsewhere, overwhelming some living tribes. The carbonic volcanoes had new\nparoxysms, slaty mud involved terrestrial plants and trees in successive\neruptions: the clay mud or colored sand was forming tertiary strata on the\nshores, involving sea animals, shells, reptiles and fishes.... This was\nthe sixth period of terrestrial events, that of land volcanoes.\n\nAfter all these; mankind was created by GOD, and appeared as lord of the\nearth, and the complement of living creation.... This may be deemed\nanother Period, if we like; although it was but the complement of the\nterrestrial living productions, begun in the 5th, and probably proceeding\nin the 6th. Where the first man or men appeared and dwelt, is unknown or\nvery dubious. Asia is commonly deemed the first dwelling of mankind, and\nCentral Asia or Thibet the cradle of our race: although China, India,\nArabia, Syria, Ceylon, &c., claim the same honor. But few authors have\nplaced this cradle in America, and even then not for the _Adamites_. Yet\nAmerica had some inhabitants before the flood, if we are to believe the\nconcurrent traditions of many American nations; who keep the memory of it,\nand point to their refuges.(5)\n\nOf these American Anti-diluvians we know little or nothing: their traces\nare few and uncertain. It would be otherwise if we could identify them\nwith the anti-diluvian _Atlantes_, or find their diluvial remains. The\nskeletons found in Guadaloupe, and on R. Santas of Brazil, by Captain\nElliott (described by Meigs in the transactions of American philosophical\nsociety 1827) in tuffa with shells, may have been buried there; like the\nmummies of many American caves. Some of the American mounds have appeared\nanti-diluvian; but the fact is not well proved. The subterranean\nantiquities are also of an equivocal character. The town of log houses\nlately found in Georgia, buried under golden clysmian soil, cannot be so\nremote; the soil instead of diluvial, may be a deep alluvial. All the\nfacts on these remote times, shall be hereafter collected, presented and\nexamined carefully.\n\nThus, has been presented by geological results, a rapid sketch of the\nAmerican periods, to the birth of mankind. These 6 periods or _yums_, are\nwell ascertained as to succession; but their duration is unknown: and each\nof them includes several subordinate periods; which it is not needful to\ninvestigate in these outlines. The works on geology may be consulted if\nrequired. These 6 _yums_ or great periods do not answer exactly to the 6\n_yums_ or manifestations of the mosaic cosmogony, since geogony begins\nonly with the 3d, ending with the 5th.\n\nSuch oriental accounts are always deserving our attention, and susceptible\nof the deepest philosophical commentary, as they mainly agree with all the\ndetected facts. But there are at least 3 accounts of the creation or\ncosmogony in the _Sepher_ or Hebrew Bible. 1. That of Job. 2. Of Moses in\nchapter 2d of Genesis from verse 4 to 25; in both, no _yums_, days nor\nperiods are mentioned. 3. The usual mosaic account of chapter 1st. ending\nonly at ch. 2, v. 3. Even in this usual account more than 7 periods can be\nfound, including heaven, earth and men.\n\nThese are the real Mosaic periods, with his own names, very different from\nthe subsequent Jewish names, in various dialects.\n\n1. PERIOD OF TIME OR YUM. BRA-SHITH Real beginning or Real Supreme Being\nproducing ALEIM the Angels, SHMIM Heavens, and ARTZ Earth.\n\n2. YUM. THEU-UBEU Chaos, and THEUM Abyss, with RUH Spirit of God.\n\n3. YUM. AUR Essence of celestial light or Ether. First divine\nmanifestation of _Mshe_ or Moses.\n\n4. YUM. RKIO Expanse or sky, diversion of aerial and celestial fluids. 2d.\n\n5. YUM. Sea and dry land, upheaving of land over the waters, or subsiding\nof the ocean. Vegetation. 3d.\n\n6. YUM. Sun and Moon appearance by a change in the misty atmosphere? with\nXUXBIM stars? 4th.\n\n7. YUM. Fishes and Fowls, &c. 5th.\n\n8. YUM. Beasts and cattle, with ADM mankind or human emanation, our Adam,\nZXR male, and NKBE female. 6th.\n\n9. YUM. _Shbioi_ seventh manifestation, _Aleim_ became IEUE Jehovah, the\nliving-self-with-self, the supreme or powerful self.\n\n10. YUM. AD emanation, our mist.\n\n11. YUM. ADM into GN or _Gan._ our Eden.\n\n12. YUM. OTZ Growth, of lives with good and evil.\n\n13. YUM. NER 4 flowing emanations or streams.\n\n14. YUM. ASHE Intellectual man-mate, called afterwards EUA living\nexistence, our Eve.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Self-with-life.\n\nAll these periods should require long comments, and discussions, rather\nphysical than historical. It is by no means certain that the sun and moon\nare implied in the 6th yum. The text says a couple of MARTH Centralities\nEMAUR-GDL and EMAUR-KTN Self-great-ether greatest and lesser. Some have\nseen here the solar and lunar dynasties of Asia. The XUX-BIM might be the\nXRUBIM of later times. The real sun and moon may belong to the _yum_ of\nAUR. The stars, according to Job, were in existence before the foundation\nof the earth, and our astronomy teaches this implicitly.\n\nIn this cosmogony, the heavenly creation takes 4 periods. The grass grows\nby light before the sun had appeared through the misty atmosphere, and the\nfishes come after the land and herbs, at the same period with fowls. Our\nactual geology does not confirm this last fact; but a proper explanation\nof the biblic words would confirm the truth.(6)\n\nMany still consider AISH intellectual man as the human race, previous to\n_Adam_, father of the Adamites; but the concurrent proofs are very\nslender: nor is their posterity known; unless _Nahash_ or the snakes,\n_Elohim_ or the sons of God, the _Rephains_ or giants, and the _Nephilim_\nor apostates, be considered as such. Indications of races of men different\nfrom the Adamites may be collected both in the Bible, and in all the\nancient annals of China, India, Iran, &c.; but no positive connected\naccount has ever been made out as yet.\n\nThe _Nahash_, _Hareth_ or _Satan_ of the Bible, is identic with the\n_Nagas_ (snakes) of the Hindus, the _Zabul_ and _Dives_, (devils) of Iran,\nevidently men, and foes of the Adamites: they are also the U-long or\nantidiluvian dragons of China. In America the satanic notions will be seen\nin the respective account of religions. They often assume in this\nhemisphere the appearance of volcanic ideas, or of a vampire malignant\nbeing. But the nations of the Linapi group connect the ideas of devils,\nsnakes and foes, all called _Ako_ or _N\u00e2\u0080\u0099akho_ very similar with _Nahash_\nand _Nagas_. They assert that they were created by the Evil Spirit, were\nalways foes of real men; that they caused the flood, and went afterwards\nto America before the Strait of Behring was formed.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_See_ Linapi\nTraditions.\n\nThe ALEIM, _Elohim_ or _Egregori_ or angels of the Hebrew were instead\nsons of God, and Moses ascribes to them the creation of the earth; while\nJob ascribes it to _Eloah_, the real God. Herder has said that we shall\nnever understand well the mosaic history, until we ascertain who were\nthese _Elohim_ and _Cherubim_(7) dwelling on earth. My dissertation on\nanti-diluvian history may perhaps help to clear the matter; meantime it\nmay be stated that they appear to be the HO-LO of anti-diluvian Chinese\nhistory, or LO-LO of their post-diluvian annals. Perhaps also the\ncelestial emperors beginning the history of China: the _Alorus_ first\ndynasty of Assyria before the flood: the _Ang_-ELOS and P\u00e2\u0080\u0099EL of the\nPelagians. Also the H\u00e2\u0080\u0099ELLO (old men) of the Egyptians, the PELEI (old men\nor ancestors) of the ancient Illyrians, the LAHI or ancient Thibetans.\n\nThey may be the ELEI or ancient Persians, the _Peris_ or _Pelis_ of Iran,\nancient beneficent beings. The Arabs and all the Semetic nation have\npreserved that name for God, in EL, _Allah_, _Baal_, or made of it their\nuniversal article _El_, _Al_, meaning HE or _the Being_: whence also the\nPelagic and Italic articles IL, L, LI, &c., the Spanish EL. By the\nfrequent usual change of L into R, we have ER root found in many languages\nfor men: forming the _Heros_ of Greece, sons of God; the HER or lords of\nthe Germanic tribes, the _Seres_ of Thibet or ancient Chinese, _Ergaz_ men\nof the African Atlantes. _Erk_ man in Turkish or Turan Atlantes, akin to\n_Egregori_!\n\nIn America these similar indications are widely spread, and among the most\nancient nations. EL means man in Tolteca and Mexican, OL is old and\n_Yollo_ a spirit or angel. EL is son and tribe in Hayti, _Elohi_ is land\nand spirit in Tzuluki. _Yol_ means _man_ in the Atakapa language of the\nCado or Nachez group. _Pele_ means the same in Lul\u00c3\u00a9 of South America; but\n_Peli_ is soul in Chilian, which approximate to _Peleg_ and _Lelex_,\nancient Pelagian tribes. The connections with TEL, TAL, TOL, pervade the\nwhole of ancient America, and lead to assimilate with the TOL-tecas and\nTALAS, American Atlantes, the Tulans or Asiatic Atlantes, the _Auto-Toles_\nor African Atlantes. These lead to the giants of both hemispheres or\nancient men of renown. But the subject must be postponed, and will be\nfound resumed in the history of Austral and Central America, where these\natlantes and giants are found.\n\nReturning from this digression; we may resume the geological periods of\nAmerica previous to mankind, in the six successive epochas, already\nmentioned.\n\n1. Period. Primitive, aquatic and before life.\n\n2. Period of aquatic organic life.\n\n3. Period of aquatic cataclysms.\n\n4. Period of the dry land or islands.\n\n5. Period of terrestrial life.\n\n6. Period of terrestrial volcanoes.\n\nAfter which begins the human period, till the flood. The question whether\nman or men appeared together, or before or after, in both hemispheres;\nmust be left undecided. Some writers have even placed _Eden_ the GN of\nMoses in America and the Hesperidian Islands of old; but as the Imalaya\nmountains, valleys and plains, are higher than the Andes, older in\ngeological series, and more suitable for human life, not being volcanic:\nit is extremely probable that they were the cradle of mankind, rather than\nAmerica.\n\nYet men reached America before the flood, and were here at this eventful\nperiod. But we are ignorant of the precise way they came, and how they\nreached this land which was then only a group of large islands, unless\nNorth America was united to Asia by Behring Strait, as very probable. The\nclearest traditions point to the east, Africa and Europe then united at\nthe Strait of Gibraltar, and the Island Atlantis as a stepping place. The\nMexican traditions point to Asia, by two different opposite quarters, the\neast and the north west. The Uskis or Innuit nations are late comers by\nthe north west. The Linapi nations, although earlier, came the same way,\nand over the ice of Behring Strait, after its disruption. The Hongwis came\nthe same way, although they boast of being Autochtones, as did the Greeks,\nwhich we know in both instances to be false.\n\nThe Nachez nations say they came from the east. The Olmecas or earliest\npeople of Anahuac point that way also; although both speak of an American\nflood. The Haytians and Cubans were also of eastern origin, like all the\nAruac nations; but remembered the flood and parceling of the islands. The\nCarib nations appear postdiluvians and the last come in South America; yet\nthe Tamanacs one of the group speak of an American flood. The Guarani call\nthemselves eastern men, and came from Africa after the flood. It is in\nSouth America, the Andes of Chili, Peru, &c., that a positive memory was\nfound of several floods and cataclysms, in or near the Andes, which gave\nrefuge to several tribes. Yet it is there also that the most obvious\nphilological affinities are found with North Africa and the shores of the\nMediteranean; while many invasions of foreign later nations are recorded,\n&c.\n\nAll these antidiluvian notions, and accounts of the American flood, will\nbe carefully collected and given. This will form the first period of human\nhistory in America, extending to 2262 years at least, according to the\ncomputation of the 70; the most plausible of all. The Tol-tecas reckon\nnearly the same time between their period of creation and their main\nflood: or with trifling differences, less than the various terms of\nJosephus and others; but various other calculations are found in Anahuac.\n\nSuch a period of 23 centuries was certainly sufficient to people America,\nand fill it. The Cainites or Cabils have been deemed parents of the\nAtlantes and Africans. They were skilful, powerful and wicked, inventing\nagriculture and arts, building cities &c.: while the Sethites invented\nastronomy, letters and dwelt in tents. If the American Atlantes were\nantidiluvian, they must have sprung from the Atlantes Cainites, KIN of\nMoses.\n\nIn 1170 years after Adam, the _Egregori_ angels of Mt. Ima, came to Mt.\nHermon, in 20 tribes, under their king Semi-Azar, and uniting with the\nCainites, gave birth to the _Rephaim_, _Nephilim_ and _Eliud_, tribes of\nGiants, tyrants and Canibals: who made war on the angels and men. They are\nsaid in the Bible to have gone to _Sheol_ (the lower world or South\nAmerica) with their king Belial: where they were drowned by the flood.\n_See Universal History._\n\nThe Giants dwelt in _Talo-tolo_, the world _Tolo_ of the Hindus, where we\nfind the _Tol_-tecas (Tol-people:) therefore America: called also _Atala_\nand once sunk in the waves; like the Atlantis of the Greek, whose Atlantes\nwere also Giants or powerful men. The Egregori have been deemed the Titans\nof the Greeks, and Atlas was a Titan. Although Gigantic Nations existed in\nAmerica, the Talegas, Toltecas, Caribs, Chilians, &c. being often such:\nthe term Giant must always be understood to refer to powerful perverse\nmen. The names of _Rephaim_ and _Nephilim_ appear unknown in America,\nbeing mere Hebrew epithets for giants and apostates.\n\nDuring this primitive period, geological and physical changes probably\nproceeded in America. The plains gradually appeared, but full of marshes,\nlakes and wide streams, muddy volcanoes, snakes, crocodiles and obnoxious\nanimals. Which must have assailed mankind and greatly impeded their\nsettlements. Although the lives of men were perhaps longer than now; yet\nit is probable that the long lives of the Patriarchs of this period,\nallude to as many Dynasties or gradual nations sprung from each other. In\nthis I agree entirely with the learned Hebrew scholar D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Olivet.(8)\n\nHuge beasts and carnivorous animals, dwelt then on earth; in America\nseveral species of mastodons, elephants, oxen, megatherium, megalonyx,\nhyenas, bears, &c., which prowled in plains and caves. The temperature of\nthe earth was higher; little clothing was needed. Men were at war with\nbeasts, and among themselves. Violence predominated in many regions, and\nNoah one of the _M\u00e2\u0080\u0099nus_ of the Hindus, a patriarch of the Adamites, a\nprophet according to the Arabs, went over the earth to preach against this\ncorruption. Not being attended to, he foresaw that a great calamity would\nbefall for these iniquities, and he prepared himself a THBE or refuge in\nCentral Asia: where he collected his relations and friends. Some say they\nwere 72, our translations of Moses reduces them to 8; but his 3 sons of\nNoah, are evidently as many tribes. The THBE of Noah contained therefore 4\ntribes, including his own, and many individuals, besides a multitude of\nanimals.\n\nI do not give now the history of this flood. Before it can be given\naccurately, we must collect all the scattered traditions about it, compare\nthem, and omitting all fabulous and obviously impossible details, form a\nnarrative of the whole facts. The notions and traditions of the Americans\nare very various, as they do not always point to this flood. We find them\nasserting that men were saved in mountains, or caves, on rafts or boats.\nFew, if any, allude to an ark, but all to a refuge as THBE. Those of\nMexico and Peru, are contradictory, alluding to several floods, and\nparticularly the subsequent of Peleg.\n\nThe most explicit traditions on that score are those of the Linapi\nnations; although the tribes vary the tale, the holy song of the real\nLinapi tribe, alludes clearly to a great flood in Asia: when their nations\nat least was partly saved in _Tula_ (the turtle land) in Central Asia, by\nthe help of a goddess, and Noah or _Nana-bush_. The men were then called\n_Linowi_ and _Linapi_: two other races of men were saved, the _Owini_\n(beings) and the _Tulapewi_, turtlings or atlantes. Besides these foes the\n_Maskanako_ (strong snakes), _Nakowa_ (dark snakes), and the _Amangamek_,\nmonsters of the sea; who caused this dire flood. These notions are\nstrikingly similar to the Asiatic and Hindu fables about the turtle saving\nmankind at the flood. _Nana-bush_ is evidently Noah, his name means\n_Noah-Noah-hare_, or the _Great Noah_ and _Hare_.\n\nThe Chinese accounts of the first flood, do not allude to any ark, but\nmountains were the refuge of mankind. The Hindu account is very near the\nmosaic; but has no boat, and many persons were saved. The accounts of the\nAssyrians, Arabs, Tartars, Egyptians, Lybians, Greeks, Celts, Polynesians,\n&c. are all different. The mosaic account was borrowed from some ancient\nsource now forgotten. It is said that Noah himself wrote an account of the\nflood, and preserved ancient records. Divesting the mosaic account from\nthe supernatural and the impossible, we obtain the real tradition of a\ngreat aquatic cataclysm. Either a sinking of some lands or an irruption of\nthe ocean, attended with volcanic floods of waters from the Caspian sea\n(as Humboldt says,) heavy rains, and a change of climate: which overflew\nthe earth or most of it; except some _Thebas_, refuges in mountains,\n_swimming_ over the waters, as it were: there some men and tribes, many\nanimals, trees and plants were preserved: to spread afterwards again over\nthe earth.\n\nAfter this flood, America was left pretty much as it is now, except that\nthe shores were higher yet, many flat plains inundated and full of\nmarshes. The Antilles yet united in larger islands and perhaps with\nCumana. The Strait of Choco nearly filled up: and diluvial soil, gravel,\nsand, boulders and organic remains scattered over the land, the hills,\nplains and caves. Many fierce beasts had disappeared, vegetation had been\ndestroyed wherever the flood went; but the buried seeds, and those of\nmountain plants gradually grew or spread again. The terrestrial animals\nand birds saved in the mountains, spread themselves again over the earth.\nMankind in despair at the disaster, kept for a long while on mountains,\nand did not occupy again the desolated hills and plains, until many years\nafter.\n\nThe Chinese account of this flood, state positively that it was attended\nwith a change in the length of the year, formerly of only 360 days, a\nchange in the seasons, an increase of cold, rain and winds: compelling men\nto dress in skins and mats. Also that the wild beasts and snakes driven to\nthe mountains, became very troublesome, men being compelled to defend\nthemselves against their attacks.\n\nThe Rev. Gleig in his late history of the Bible, where like Hales and\nRussel, he has at last adopted the computation of the Septuagint and\nJosephus, reckons 5411 years from Adam to our era, the oriental Christians\nreckon 5508 years, the Toltecas, reckoned 5099 years. Gleig puts Noah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nflood 2259 years after Adam. The Chinese and Hindu chronology are partly\nfabulous; but may be reconciled to these periods; as well as to the second\ncataclysm of the earth; that of Peleg according to the Biblists. The only\nknowledge the Bible gives about it, is that the earth was split, broken or\ndivided, in the time of the patriarch or dynasty of Peleg; who lived or\nlasted from 531 to 870 after Noah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flood. But David has sung this\ncataclysm in the 18th psalm. The Chinese account brings this second flood\nto the year 2296 before Christ, or 858 years after the former. The Hindu\naccount concealed in many fables agrees also with this period. But it\nappears to have lasted longer, and many years. It is evidently in date the\nmistaken Hebrew flood, blending both into one, and annihilating the place\nbetween them. The Chinese account distinctly speaks of both, the first was\nunder _Yunti_, the second under _Yao_, and 42 emperors are mentioned\nbetween the two floods.\n\nIn America, it is often difficult to distinguish which is meant by the\nvarious imperfect traditions: yet in Mexico and Peru, there are at least\ntwo cataclysms mentioned by the annals or traditions. Also among some\nnorthern tribes. The Linapi annals or songs allude to the second, which\nbroke by volcanoes the _Lusasaki_ (burnt land) and separated America or\n_Akomenaki_ (snake island) from Asia to Behring strait.\n\nThus the real antidiluvian periods lasted nearly 3000 years from Adam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nepocha, or 3212 by oriental computation. The interval between Adam and\nNoah ought to be called the Adamic period, that between Noah and Peleg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfloods the Noahic period. It was at this last convulsion that the earth\ntook its actual form. The Straits of Gibraltar, Calais, Messina,\nHellespont, Bosphorus, Babelmandel, Behring, Malaca, Sunda, &c., were then\nformed. The Atlantis Island in the Atlantic Ocean and the Island Lanca in\nthe Indian Ocean were sunk. The Azores, Madeira, Canaries, &c. are\nfragments of the Atlantis: Ceylon, Madagascar, &c. the fragments of\nLanca.(9)\n\nIn America, the Boreal islands may have been broken, like the British\nislands of Europe. Some suppose that they might once join together with\nIceland. The Antilles were split in the actual form\u00e2\u0080\u0094Behring Strait divided\nAmerica from Asia. The Polynesia lands were broken or sunk. The lowlands\nof Chili, Peru, and the Atlantic shores were inundated and then partly\nleft dry by huge volcanic tides. This cataclysm was not a mere aquatic\nflood; but a violent volcanic flood, having at least three great focusses,\n1. in the North Atlantic Ocean, 2. In the Indian Ocean, 3. In Polynesia or\nthe Pacific Ocean. In China all the lowlands were overflowed and partly\noverwhelmed. The great Islands of Java and Sumatra were formed; which\nformerly were united with Asia and several islands in the vicinity, under\nthe remembered name of _Sunda_ land.\n\nIf mankind had not reached America before Noah, it must surely have\nreached it before this second cataclysm. The Atlantes were in the\nneighbourhood and bold navigators, as well as the primitive Pelagians,\nLybians, Cantabrians; bearing then various peculiar names, mostly traced\nin America. Twenty American nations have distinct remembrance of this\nsplitting of American lands and islands; local or partial floods, less\ngeneral and disastrous than the former.\n\nThis cataclysm was not so deadly to animals and vegetables as the former;\nbut it must have destroyed them in several sunken islands: and have added\nsecond clysmian strata to the soil of the plains: with many volcanic\nproductions, chiefly clay and sand, limy and marshy muds. The memorials,\nannals and traditions of the American nations are very scanty on this\nperiod; difficult to be distinguished from the Adamic: while the monuments\nto be referred to it, are not easily traced, nor distinct in form. The\n_Linapi_ tribes had not yet reached America, and dwelt in Asia; but by\ntheir account the Snake tribes _Akowi_ went to America in that period, led\nby _Nakopowa_ (the Snake priest); it is even hinted that they caused this\ncataclysm or at least the separation of Asia and America, at _Lusasaki_\n(burnt land), in order to escape their foes, the _Elowi-chik_ (hunters) of\nthe _Linnapewi_, the original manly people.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\n    GENERAL VIEW _of the Ancient and Modern Annals of Both\n    Americas.\u00e2\u0080\u0094european Colonies, Modern Fate Of Nations, Late Physical\n    Changes, &c._\n\n\nAfter these floods begin the primitive annals of mankind in America as\nelsewhere; but still scanty, obscure and involved in fables, by\npersonifications of tribes, metamorphoses into animals, plants, fruits or\neven stones and mountains. The origin of nearly all the nations is neither\nclear nor well ascertained, by their mere annals; but the collateral\nproofs of the languages facilitate the enquiry. Those who have the most\npositive facts of primitive times are the Ongwis, Linapis, Toltecas,\nTainos, Peruvians, &c.; but commonly destitute of dates and correct\ndetails. We ought not to be surprised at this, since even in Asia (except\nin China,) we possess nothing but fragments on those times; while the most\npolished nations of oldest times, the Egyptians, Greeks, Persians, Arabs,\nJews, &c. have involved their early histories in fables, mythologies and\nfalse dates.\n\nHowever, whatever might be the early origin of the American nations, it\nmay be collected from all, that in the ancient periods; they were few in\nnumber and in population; principally confined to some peculiar seats of\ncivilization: such as the regions of Apalacha, Hayti, Anahuac, Oaxaca,\nChiapa, Maya, Cundina, Oronoc, and Peru. We have positive proofs of early\nempires and splendid monumental cities at Teoti-huacan, Otolum, Coban &c.\nin Central America; and in South America at Chimu, Tiahuanaco &c.; while\ncities and monuments of a lesser order or size, were scattered afterwards\nfrom the Lakes of Canada and the River Ohio, to Chili and Brazil: probably\nthrough the dispersion and colonization of these early empires or\nstates.(10)\n\nAfter they had filled the most fruitful or suitable regions, carrying with\nthem agriculture, domestic animals, religion, laws and various graphic\nsystems: they were invaded by tribes less civilized; but more warlike;\nprincipally in North America, and in Guyana, Brazil &c. Many revolutions\nmust have followed these contests: some of which are recorded in the\nApalachian region of the United States, in the Mexican table land, in\nHayti &c. and by the Muyzcas, Peruvians &c. further south: while in Guyana\nand Brazil the annals are lacking, and the traces of these conflicts but\nfaint; yet certified by some traditions and the new tribes introduced.\n\nThe solar worship prevailed among the most civilized nations and empires:\nthat of Naguals or Zemis (spirits) among those of the second degree. The\nleast civilized nations had either adopted the Dualism or a mixed\nreligion: while the barbarous tribes knew only a kind of _Tao_ religion as\nin China,(11) or a fetichism, venerating one or many objects of nature.\nBut these four main worships, were subject to many fluctuations, and\ndiversities: they had often degenerated into a Polytheism, and idolatry,\nwith various rites, and some cruel customs, human sacrifices &c. A kind of\npriesthood was almost universal and formed a peculiar caste in many\nstates. The legislators and rulers had often been priests, and became\npontifs as well as kings, in Cuzco, Chimu, Tunca, Mayapan, Cholula,\nManazicas &c.\n\nDuring a period of 2 or 3000 years after the floods, the earth had\nundergone many changes by volcanoes, earthquakes and the subsiding of the\nsea. Many valleys were drained, their lakes lessened or disappeared; the\nshores of the Atlantic from New Jersey to Florida and Yucatan, and from La\nPlata to Magellania, as well as those of Peru, Chili &c. were increased by\nthe gradual retreat of the sea. The great plains of the Mississippi,\nOronoc, Maranon and Parana were also formed or drained of their swamps and\nmorasses.\n\nIt is at the end of this epocha, equal to the antecedent antidiluvian\nperiod, that the real or certain history of the Americans begins with many\ndetails and dates; both in the north and south. It was then that the\nempires of the Toltecas, Utatlans, Mexicans, Apalachis, Mayapans, Incas\n&c. were established on the ruins of many anterior states. We obtain by\nthe annals preserved or recovered of many such nations, a tolerable view\nof this part of their history, and even an insight into earlier times,\nwhen similar revolutions must have happened. If many states or nations\nrose and fell in this hemisphere, unknown to the other: it was a common\nfate with others in Africa, Polynesia and even in Asia. But we may hope to\nrescue their names if not their deeds, from total oblivion, by seeking\ntheir monuments, and the fragments of human tribes they left to mourn\ntheir fate.\n\nIn this period some American nations rose to a degree of splendor and\ncivilization, with knowledge of arts and sciences, little inferior to\nGreeks and Romans; and superior to the European nations of the middle\nages, even down to 1492: quite equal at least to that of the Egyptians and\nHindus. The American graphic systems of Apalacha, Anahuac, Maya, Otolum,\nPeru; although peculiar, were quite sufficient to transmit knowledge in\nbooks, schools and inscriptions. This high civilization was not merely\nconfined to Mexico and Peru, as often erroneously supposed; but was\nscattered from the Apalachis and Nachez of Florida to the Chilians south\nof Peru, filling the whole intermediate space.\n\nAlthough war and slavery prevailed in many parts, they were modified by\nthe usage of adoption for individuals and whole tribes, mutual alliances,\nconfederacies &c.: while slavery was changed into a feodal vassalage. The\nfeodal system and the castes prevailed in all civilized nations of\nAmerica, as in India and Asia from earliest time.\n\nInstead of perpetual wars the ancient annals of America, present us with\nthe soothing view of wise legislators, who gave civilization and happiness\nto millions for ages, and conquered by deeds of peace. Such were most of\nthe conquests of the Bohitos, Bochicas, Incas, Quetzals, Cuculcans,\nTzomes, Maponos, Tamanends, Tarenyos &c. worthy lawgivers of the Antilles,\nMuyzcas, Peru, Anahuac, Mayas, Guaranis, Manazicas, Linapis, and Ongwis. I\nshall revive, with pleasure, their memory and deeds, dwelling on them with\nmore pleasure than on the cruel war leaders.\n\nTo them the Americans were indebted for their policy, diplomacy,\nalliances, agriculture and knowledge, with the peculiar happy mode of\nholding the land in common or feodal tenure, with property in tenements\nand moveables. To them may be traced the introduction of useful plants,\nthe maize, cotton, quinoa, patatas, yams, manioc, banana, gourds, beans,\nand 100 other cultivated plants and fruits. The Mexicans had even botanic\ngardens and pleasure grounds before the modern Europeans. The universities\nof Cuzco, Tunca, Tezcuco, Cholula, Mayapan, Utatlan &c. were founded\nearlier than the European universities by such benefactors of mankind; and\n112 domestic animals had been tamed in America, while only 80 in the\neastern hemisphere. Of which must be reckoned.(12)\n\n                    In the W.         In the Eastern.\n                    Hemisphere.\nQuadrupeds          33 kinds          only 25 kns.\nBirds               32                25\nReptiles            15                10\nFishes              12                10\nInsects             8                 4\nShells and worms    12                6\n\nThe modern history of America since 1492 presents a multitude of events\nwith regular dates: but the historians of these later times instead of\ndwelling upon the native nations, appear to notice them merely _en\npassant_! while relating at length the discoveries, conquests and wars of\nthe European adventurers and colonists.\n\nIt is not thus that we are to notice them; but as equal nations. Now that\nafter four ages, these colonies are also become independent nations, and\nbegin to nurse American feelings, we ought to feel for them, and reveal\nthe truth. It is not number nor dominion alone that constitute a people;\nbut a peculiar language, and peculiar manners. The modern history of the\nAraucanians, Guaranis, Caribs, and North American tribes, is the best\nknown by peculiar fragments; but similar fragments may be collected on\nmany other tribes.\n\nMeantime Columbus came, another leader of colonists to America; since many\nhad come before him: and with him came the ferocious gold hunters of\nCastille; who in their greedy search after golden wealth, trampled under\nfoot, both religion and humanity. They enslaved, tortured and destroyed\nmillions of human beings from Hayti to Mexico and Peru; but were checked\nat last in Florida, Chili, Tologalpa, Santa Marta &c. They overthrew many\nflourishing states, and erected over them a slavish colonial fabric, soon\nafter sunk in sloth and ignorance.(13)\n\nThe dissentions of Mexico and Peru were the cause of their ruin and\nsubjugation by the Spaniards; but the Floridans, Apaches Tayronas, Poyays,\nCaribs, Mbayas, Chilians &c. withstood forever their utmost efforts, and\nnever were conquered. The happy states of Yucatan, Guatimala, Tunca,\nHayti, Cuba &c. fell by their unwarlike and peaceful friendly disposition;\nbeing cruelly betrayed and desolated.\n\nIn the east, Brazil was occupied by the Portuguese, where a bastard tribe\nof Mamalucos were born; who sought for slaves and gold, from Guayana to\nParaguay, and destroyed many tribes. After these unworthy freebooters,\ncame the rabble of pirates and buccaneers to revenge American wrongs, upon\nthe Spaniards and Portuguese by deeds of cruelty. Thus was America flooded\nwith blood, and groaning in tears for nearly three centuries. But even\nthese horrible deeds were not the only ones to deplore. Not satisfied with\nthe weak labor of American slaves; another continent was overrun, to\nsupply stronger hands, and Africa was made to contribute millions of\nslaves to swell American population, or sink there to premature death\nunder the lashing scourge of cruel tasks.\n\nThe English, French, and Dutch wishing to partake of the American spoils,\nwent in search of wealth all over the shores of this continent. Not\nsatisfied with mere trading colonies, as in India, they sent stationary\ncolonies of slaves and planters, to occupy some weak points, with or\nwithout the consent of the nations. The Dutch settled in Brazil, Surinam,\nCurazao and New York. The French in Canada, Louisiana, Florida, Hayti, the\nCarib Islands, Cayenne and Brazil; but have gradually lost all those\ncolonies, except Cayenne and a few Carib Ids.\n\nThe English nation, more daring, steady and lucky, occupied with their\nauxiliaries, the Scotch and Irish, some points of the Atlantic shores,\nmany Carib Islands &c.: by conquest they acquired New York, Canada,\nDemerary, Jamaica and some smaller islands. Since, whenever the Europeans\nwere at war among themselves, they carried their quarrels over the ocean,\nand endeavored to destroy each other. Laterly among them arose in North\nAmerica the holy flame of freedom and independence, which has been\ntravelling and spreading throughout the continent, ever since.\n\nBut among these contending colonies and slaving plantations, how were the\nowners of the soil, treated and dealt with? Alas! seldom with\njustice\u00e2\u0080\u0094Popes and kings gave away lands and rights, which did not belong\nto them; nobles and merchants, availing themselves of this doubtful right,\nbought with trifling presents the good will of some tribes, or drove them\naway by force. Thus were settled most of the American colonies; except a\nfew, attempted in a spirit of religion and peace.\n\nThe worthy Las-Casas, immortal be his name! gave the example of reducing\nunsubdued tribes to peaceful allies, by words and deeds of peace and\npiety, and Tezutlan thus reduced by him was called Verapaz. When the\nSpanish and Portuguese freebooters were sunk in wealth and sloth; they\nfound it very convenient to employ the Jesuits and other monks to subdue\nfor them whole tribes and nations, by this easy mode. In North America,\nRoger Williams and William Penn, blessed be their names! settled colonies\nwithout strife, and by mere good will towards the owners of the soil. But\nevery where the foes or successors of these missionaries of peace,\ndeceived or betrayed the allies they had made. Unjust wars were the\nnatural consequence, in which the rightful party, did not often prevail,\nbeing overpowered by strength and cunning.\n\nMeantime the independent period opens a new era for America. In 1776 the\nUnited States of North America confederate and become free. Seventeen\nyears afterwards the black slaves of Hayti unfurl the standard of broken\nchains. Between 1808 and 1820 the whole of Spanish America shakes the weak\npower of Spain. In 1822 the whole of Brazil becomes an American empire.\nSlavery is abolished in all the Spanish states, only retained in the\ncolonies of Cuba and Porto Rico. In 1834 England emancipates the slaves of\nall her colonies. Slavery was gradually excluded from many states of N.\nAmerica, at early periods; but others from Virginia to Louisiana are\ntenacious of these unholy and dangerous bonds.\n\nNow, the native American tribes within the claimed territories of these\nnew independent nations, are under a sort of pupilage, and often\noppressed: although no longer slaves from Canada to Chili. Brazil alone\nadmits of indescriminate slavery, and will rue the consequence at some\nfuture period, like those colonies and states that delay wiser measures.\nMeanwhile at the two ends of America, in Canada and the United States, as\nin Buenos Ayres, a new kind of oppression has appeared. Land stealing and\ncompulsory sales! unhallowed means to increase wealth, nearly as guilty as\nthe precious Spanish gold hunting.\n\nThe United States which ought to set the wisest example, of justice and\nclemency, towards reduced tribes, diminished by vices taught instead of\nvirtues, are doing the reverse. They refuse to amalgamate the native\ntribes, admit them to equal rights, as in the new Spanish States; but\ncompel them to submit to laws not understood, in a language untaught, or\ndisqualify them for witnesses. They compel them to remove, emigrate,\ndisperse, sell their lands and homes, at one tenth of the value; and this\nis called fair dealing!\n\nNotwithstanding that the European states or colonies, occupy or claim,\nnearly the whole of both Americas; yet there are many vast regions as yet\nunsettled by them, and where dwell or wander several free tribes,\nparticularly in the Arctic wilds, in Oregon, California, Texas, the\nMissouri plains, New Mexico, Sinaloa, Tologalpa, in N. America\u00e2\u0080\u0094and in S.\nAmerica in the vast plains and deserts of the Oronoko, Maranon, Brazil,\nChaco, Chili and Magellania. The most prominent of these modern tribes are\nthe Uskis or Esquimaux, the Dinnis, the Chopunish, Dacotas or Sioux, Panis\nor Sker\u00c3\u00a9s, Washas or Ozages, Chactas, Tzulukis, Apaches or Cumanches,\nPoyays or Musquitos &c. In South America, the Aruacs, Caribs, Omaguas,\nMaynas, Aymaras, Puris, Mbayas, Araucas, Talahets or Pampas &c. All\ndivided into many lesser tribes and independent communities.\n\nInstead of endeavoring to civilize them by fair means and deeds of peace,\nmany continue to be exasperated by unfair dealings, greedy traders,\nintemperance, and above all by killing their game, and stealing their\nlands. Some missions are established from Groenland to Chili; but the\nintercourse of the majority is with traders, trappers, land-hunters or\nsquatters, and the military of the frontiers: from whom they can imbibe no\nvery favorable idea of their oppressors.\n\nHow is this to end? Is it really intended to grasp the whole continent,\nand make these fragments of nations, aliens on their own soil? or to\nannihilate them at last? Beware! men of bad faith, or greedy of landed\nwealth! There is a God in heaven, and he deals justly with nations as with\nmen. He may find means to punish you, if you continue to violate the\nsacred laws of mankind. The desperate tribes, either become stronger by\nconcentration, or acquired knowledge, may fall on you at last, like so\nmany Goths and Vandals, Huns and Tartars, to revenge their wrongs, and\ndesolate this land wrongly acquired. Or among you will arise Agrarian\nsects, that will deprive your children of this landed property so unjustly\nacquired and held.\n\nBe wise and just in time, if cupidity does not blind you, imitate the\nhappy policy of Mexico, Guatimala, Peru &c. that has admitted the natives\nto equality and citizenship. Do better still, allow them to form peculiar\nstates and territories, preserving their languages and laws, and admit\nthese states into your confederacies. Then you will be secure, and both\nlive in peace, increasing and multiplying as time rolls on. There is land\nenough for all, and to spare. What need has a man of 1000 acres of land;\nwhile 100 can support a large family! in the cold climates, and 10 acres\nin the fruitful tropical climates, where thrive the banana and the sugar\ncane. If hunters require a large wilderness to sustain their mode of life,\ngreedy worshippers of mammon wish for 10,000 acres to hold waste for\nspeculation! or to fill with plantations of slaves and tenants, in order\nto become lords of future generations; but the real wise and active men,\nthe props of society, are content with moderate, secure estates, which\nthey may improve and beautify into smiling gardens.\n\nThe modern intercourse of the two hemispheres has been productive of much\nmore misery, than mutual benefit. The Americans have received the European\ncattle without imparting to Europe, their equally useful Peruvian cattle;\nthey have received the horse, and often adopted him as a friend, to become\nTartars and Arabs by his help, so as to retaliate mischief on the cruel\nSpaniards. Some European fruits and grains have been received and\ncultivated: while all have been introduced into the colonies. Woolen\ncloth, blankets, iron and copper kettles, tools, trinkets, guns and\ngunpowder, with the liquid poisons of the still, have been spread by\ntrade. These last with horses and guns, have been the chief deadly weapons\nof Europe against America.(14)\n\nIn return, Europe has received gold, silver and precious furs: pearls and\ndiamonds, cochineel, annato, indigo, die woods, vicunia wool, cacao,\nvanilla, gum elastic and many other useful or medical articles. Maize,\nreturning east whence it came; with tobacco, a loathsome weed of heathen\ngrowth and rites. Human knowledge has been increased, and trade greatly\nenlarged; the tame cavias, with turkeys and musky-ducks have been\ntransmitted. Thus Europe has been the gainer, and was for a long while\njealous of these treasures.(15)\n\nUnder the pious guise of hypocrisy, the heavenly religion of Jesus, was\noffered or forced upon many American nations, by the same men, who were\nbehaving worse than heathens, worshipping gold and mammon with the earth\nitself, bathed in human blood and tears; introducing slavery and over\ntoils; exulting in deeds of cruelty, revenge, wanton lust, cupidity and\navarice; with all the other anti-christian vices. If Mexico had ghastly\nidols and cruel rites; Hayti, Cuba, Bogota, Peru &c. had not; but\npeaceful, harmless worships: to which was substituted the papal worships\nof other idols, saints and monks. The pure undefiled religion of love and\npeace to all mankind, was seldom introduced in America, even by the\nJesuits\u00e2\u0080\u0094except by the heavenly Las-Casas, the friendly quakers, the humane\nmoravians, and a few other christian missionaries. All the sects of\nchristianity have now spread to America, and even some arisen there; nay,\nthe Jews have reached this continent, with a few Mahometans, Hindus,\nChinese, Budhists &c. Thus all the religions of the earth are now found in\nthis hemisphere, by the tolerance and freedom of opinions lately\nproclaimed in many parts.\n\nGreat has been the influence of 3 or 4 ages, on the American tribes, that\nhave been enslaved, or in frequent communication with the nations of\nEurope\u00e2\u0080\u0094not in religion alone; but in dress, manners, knowledge,\ncivilization and pursuits. The alphabetical writing has been introduced\namong them, the Tzulukis have invented a syllabic alphabet; some arts, and\nthe pastoral nomadic life have been adopted. In the boreal regions, the\nEnglish and Russians employ the hunting tribes as providers of furs. In\nSouth America the native tribes are often skillful fishermen or traders.\n\nUpon the whole, the late prospects of America are cheering. Many\nindependent nations have sprung, which deem themselves Americans, and love\ntheir homes. A general spirit of tolerance and peace is spreading, the\ntrue religion of the heart better understood; and a disposition is\nevincing to render tardy justice to the oppressed tribes, and the poor\nslaves. Those who wish oppression and intolerance to be perpetuated, are\nnot many in this continent, at present; they will be fewer still in half a\ncentury or the year 1892.\n\nThus, mankind lives in fluctuations of mind and manners. A few ages have\nbeen sufficient to produce these mighty changes. Meanwhile, nature\nalthough changing slower, is still at work on the soil of this hemisphere.\nSince 1492 volcanoes have appeared and disappeared, the sea shores have\nreceded, the lakes are falling, the streams are lessening, the mountains\nare crumbling, the swamps are draining: immense forests have been cut, and\nchanged into ploughed fields, hills have been cut or ploughed, roads,\ncauseways and canals made, splendid cities have been built, with\ninnumerable towns and villages. The deltas of the Mississippi and\nMagdalena have been cultivated, many mines dug for metals or coals. The\nface of the country has been quite changed in these new seats of\ncivilization; in the regions of Apalacha from Canada to Louisiana, in\nGuyana, Brazil; but in the western regions from Mexico to Chili,\nagriculture has rather receded: they had at least as many towns and fields\nin ancient times.\n\nEarthquakes and irruptions of the sea have caused sad changes in other\nparts, gulfs have been formed on the coast of Cumana, Callao twice sunken\nin volcanic tides, mountains and cities overthrown from Popayan to Chili:\nwhile the alluvial formations proceed along the streams and shores; their\nfloods are perennials, increasing deltas and islands: Hurricanes scatter\nruins and dismay over the Antilles, whirlwinds prostrate strips of\nforests. The spouting springs and earthy volcanoes eject water, mud, clay\nand marl, pitch and other substances. The water volcanoes drown valleys\nand cities, have ruined Guatimala, and desolated Quito. Mexico near a lake\nand often overflowed by it, is now distantly removed; the lake having been\ndrained by nature and art jointly combined.(16)\n\nThese rapid sketches and views offer a connected picture of men and soil,\nin this hemisphere, during the ages past. The detailed local annals of the\nvarious nations, will enlarge the subject, and present the required\noutlines of the ancient and modern events of both.\n\n                  \u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\u00e2\u0080\u0090\n\nAfter these general topics on American history, I had proposed to enter\nupon the peculiar annals of nations, beginning by Peru and Austral\nAmerica; but wishing to give in this first volume something still more\nnovel and striking, I have concluded to begin by the original unpublished\nannals of the Linapis, and the neglected traditions of the Haytians; who\nassert to have come into America, by the north west, and the second\nthrough the Atlantic Ocean. I hear besides that a French traveller\nD\u00e2\u0080\u0099Orbigny, is now publishing in Paris, his travels in Austral and Peruvian\nAmerica, with 60 vocabularies of languages: where I may perhaps find\nadditioned materials for the history of those regions.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\n    _Original Annals and Historical Traditions of the_ LINAPIS, _from\n    the creation to the flood, passage and settlements in America, as\n    far as the Atlantic Ocean &c., till 1820 &c._\n\n\nWe have but few real American Annals, given in the original peculiar\nstyle. Those of Mexico, Guatimala, Apalacha, Hayti, Peru, &c., have all\nbeen translated by abridgements or paraphrases. Those of the _Ongwi_ by\nCusick come nearest to the aboriginal form, using the usual\npersonifications and animalizations of tribes, so common all over America\nand Asia; but so often misunderstood: having perplexed and disgusted the\ncommentators or translators; who did not seize this form of style. Even in\nChina, the primitive inhabitants often bear the names of beasts, _Lung_\ndragons, _Chi_ birds, _Yao_ wolf, _Miao_ tygers. In India we find snakes,\nmonkeys, lions &c. Early in Europe are dogs _Canari and Cynetes_, satyrs,\nlions &c., syrens, harpies, pegasus, centaurs, faunes, cyclops &c.(17)\n\nIn the Antilles the first inhabitants were called beasts or _Caracol_,\nturtles _Icota_, birds, opossums, seals, trees, stones, even gourds and\nfruits.\u00e2\u0080\u0094(Roman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Trad.) In Peru we find tygers, lions, giants, pygmies,\nsnakes &c. In Mexico, birds, apes, snakes, tygers, giants &c. While\nthroughout North America we find tribes of beavers, turtles, wolves, dogs,\ndeer, birds. We must learn to appreciate this primitive form of speech and\nstyle, as allegorical names of men &c. It is very needful in order to\nunderstand the following narratives.\n\nHaving obtained, through the late Dr. Ward of Indiana, some of the\noriginal _Wallam-Olum_ (painted record) of the Linapi tribe of Wapahani or\nWhite River, the translation will be given of the songs annexed to each:\nwhich form a kind of connected annals of the nation. In the illustrations\nof this history, will be figured the original glyphs or symbols, and the\noriginal songs, with a literal translation, word for word. This will\nfurnish a great addition to our knowledge of American graphics and\nphilology; but here the annals are chiefly interesting historically. I\nhave translated, however, all the historical and geographical names, so as\nto afford a better clue to the whole.(18)\n\nWe knew by all the writers who have had friendly intercourse with the\ntribes of North America, that they did possess, and perhaps keep yet,\nhistorical and traditional records of events, by hieroglyphs or symbols,\non wood, bark, skins, in stringed wampuns &c.; but none had been published\nin the original form. This shall be the first attempt. Lederer saw 200\nyears ago in Carolina, wheels of 60 rays, recording events of 60 years.\nHumboldt has mentioned the glyphical symbols of the Hurons on wood, seen\nby the Jesuits. Heckwelder saw the _Olumapi_ or painted sticks of the\nLinapis; but did not describe them; he merely translated some of their\ntraditional tales: which agree in the main, with these historical songs;\nyet the songs appear mere abridgments of more copious annals, or the bases\nof the traditions. The Ninniwas or Chipiwas, the Ottowas, the Sakis and\nShawanis &c., all Linapi tribes, have such painted tales and annals,\ncalled _Neobagun_ (male tool) by the former. Tanner has figured some of\nthese pictured songs or _Neobagun_, in his interesting Narrative. Loskiel\nhas stated that the Linapis had complete genealogies, with symbols\nexpressing the deeds of each king. Beatty in 1766 saw records 370 years\nold.\n\nOut of these materials and other kept by the Ozages, Cowetas, Tzulukis,\nPanis &c., might be formed or restored a peculiar graphic system of north\nAmerica, different from the Mexican system; and probably once imported\nfrom Asia: where it may be compared with the graphic symbols of the\nKuriles, Yakuts, Koriaks &c., indicated by Humboldt; but which are unknown\nto me. Meantime I shall give materials for such researches in my\nillustrations. The symbols, when met alone, were inexplicable; but by\nobtaining the words or verses, (since they must commonly be sung) we may\nacquire enough to lead on further enquiries. The most obvious peculiarity\nof this system, is that each symbol applies to a verse or many words; as\nif the ideas were amalgamated in the compound system: yet they may often\nbe analyzed, and the elements ascertained or conjectured, by their\nrepetition.\n\nThese historical songs of the Linapi, are known to but few individuals,\nand must be learned with much labor. Those obtained, consist of 3 ancient\nsongs relating their traditions previous to arrival in America, written in\n24, 16 and 20 symbols, altogether 60. They are very curious, but destitute\nof chronology. The second series relates to America, is comprised in 7\nsongs, 4 of 16 verses of 4 words, and 3 of 20 verses of 3 words. It begins\nat the arrival in America, and is continued without hardly any\ninterruption till the arrival of the European colonists towards 1600. As\n96 successive kings or chiefs are mentioned, except ten that are nameless:\nit is susceptible of being reduced to a chronology of 96 generations,\nforming 32 centuries, and reaching back to 1600 years before our era. But\nthe whole is very meagre, a simple catalogue of rulers, with a few deeds:\nyet it is equal to the Mexican annals of the same kind. A last song, which\nhas neither symbols nor words, consisting in a mere translation, ends the\nwhole, and includes some few original details on the period from 1600 to\n1820.(19)\n\nThe orthography of the Linapi names is reduced to the Spanish and French\npronunciation, except SH as in English, U as in French, W as Hou.\n\nIf any one is inclined to doubt this historical account; the concurrent\ntestimonies of Loskiel and Heckewelder are my corroborant proofs. The\nwords of Loskiel are these.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Delawares keep genealogies, with the character of each man, if wise,\nrich, renowned, or a mighty warrior. They use _hieroglyphs_ on wood, trees\nand stones, to give caution, information, communicate events,\nachievements, keep records. Some time the hero has at his feet, men, heads\nor weapons. They have also paintings on skins of deeds, hunts, feats &c.\n\n1. _Song._\u00e2\u0080\u0094_The Creation &c._\n\n1. At first there was nothing but sea-water on the top of the land. _Aki._\n\n2. There was much water, and much fog over the land, and there was also\nKITANI-TOWIT, the God-creator.\n\n3. And this God-creator was the first-being (_Saye-wis_), an eternal\nbeing, and invisible although every where.\n\n4. It was he who caused much water, much land, much cloud, much heaven.\n\n5. It was he who caused the sun, the moon and the stars.\n\n6. And all these he caused to move well.\n\n7. By his action, it blew hard, it cleared up, and the deep water ran off.\n\n8. It looks bright, and islands stood there.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Menak._\n\n9. It was then, when again the _God-Creator_ made the makers or\nspirits.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Manito-Manitoak._\n\n10. And also the first beings _Owiniwak_, and also the angels\n_Angelatawiwak_, and also the souls _Chichankwak_, all them he made.(20)\n\n11. And afterwards he made the man-being JIN-WIS, ancestor of the men.(21)\n\n12. He gave him the first mother NETA-MIGAHO, mother of the first beings\nOWINI.(22)\n\n13. And fishes he gave him, turtles he gave him, beasts he gave him, birds\nhe gave him.\n\n14. But there was a bad spirit _Makimani_, who caused the bad beings\n_Makowini_, black snakes _Nakowak_, and monsters or large reptiles\n_Amangamek_.\n\n15. And caused also flies, and caused also gnats.\n\n16. All the beings were then friends and stood there.\n\n17. Thou being KIWIS, good God WUNAND (these are 2 gods) and the good\nmakers or spirits were such.\n\n18. With the Jins NIJINI, the first men, and the first mother, their\nwives, which were Fairies _Nantinewak_.(23)\n\n19. The first food of the Jins and Fairies was a fat fruit _Gattamin_.\n\n20. All were willingly-pleased, all were easy-thinking, and all were\nwell-happified.\n\n21. But after awhile a Snake-priest, _Powako_, brings on earth secretly\nthe Snake worship _Initako_, of the god of the Snakes WAKON.(24)\n\n22. And there came wickedness, crime and unhappiness.\n\n23. And bad weather was coming, distemper was coming, with death was\ncoming.\n\n24. All this happened very long ago, at the first land _Netamaki_, beyond\nthe great ocean _Kitahikan_.\n\n_2d Song. The Flood &c._\n\n1. There was long ago a powerful snake _Maskanako_, when the men had\nbecome bad beings _Makowini_.\n\n2. This strong snake had become the foe of the Jins, and they became\ntroubled, hating each other.\n\n3. Both were fighting, both were spoiling, both were never peaceful.\n\n4. And they were fighting, least man _Mattapewi_ with dead-keeper\n_Nihanlowit_.\n\n5. And the strong snake readily resolved to destroy or fight the beings\nand the men.\n\n6. The dark snake he brought, the monster (_Amangam_) he brought, snake\nrushing-water he brought.\n\n7. Much water is rushing, much go to hills, much penetrate, much\ndestroying.\n\n8. Meantime at TULA, at that island, NAMA-BUSH (the great hare _Nana_)\nbecame the ancestor of beings and men.\n\n9. Being born creeping, he is ready to move and dwell at TULA.(25)\n\n10. The beings and men (_Owini and Linowi_) all go forth from the flood\ncreeping in shallow water, or swimming afloat, asking which is the way to\nthe turtle back TULAPIN. (This verse like many others is in rhymes, and\nmetre of 9 words of 3 syllables.)\n\n11. But there were many monsters (_Amangamek_) in the way, and some men\nwere devoured by them.\n\n12. But the daughter of a spirit, helped them in a boat, saying come,\ncome, they were coming and were helped. (The name of the boat or raft is\n_Mokol_.)\n\n13. Nanabush, Nanabush, became the grandfather of all, the grandfather of\nthe beings, the grandfather of the men, and the grandfather of the\nturtles. (This is the beginning of a hymn to Nanabush, in rhymes, lasting\nfor 4 verses.)\n\n14. The men were there, the turtle there, they were turtling altogether.\n(_Tulapewi_ are the turtle-men.)\n\n15. He was frightened, he the turtle, he was praying, he the turtle, let\nit be to make well.\n\n16. Water running off, it is drying, in the plains and the mountains, at\nthe path of the cave, elsewhere went the powerful action or motion.\n\n_3d Song. Fate after the Flood._\n\n1. After the flood, the manly men _Linapewi_, with the manly turtle beings\ndwelt close together at the cave house, and dwelling of _Talli_.\n\n2. It freezes was there, it snows was there, it is cold was there.\n\n3. To possess mild coldness and much game, they go to the northerly plain,\nto hunt cattle they go.\n\n4. To be strong and to be rich the comers divided into tillers and\nhunters. _Wikhi-chik_, _Elowi-chik_.\n\n5. The most strong, the most good, the most holy, the hunters they\nare.(26)\n\n6. And the hunters spread themselves, becoming northerlings, easterlings,\nsoutherlings, westerlings. _Lowaniwi_, _Wapaniwi_, _Shawaniwi_,\n_Wunkeniwi_.\n\n7. Thus the white country _Lumonaki_, north of the turtle country, became\nthe hunting country of the turtling true men.\n\n8. Meantime all the snakes were afraid in their huts, and the snake priest\n_Nakopowa_ said to all, let us go.\n\n9. Easterly they go forth at Snakeland _Akhokink_, and they went away\nearnestly grieving.\n\n10. Thus escaping by going so far, and by trembling the burnt land\n_Lusasaki_ is torn and is broken from the snake fortified land.\n_Akomenaki_.\n\n11. Being free, having no trouble, the northerlings all go out,\nseparating, at the land of Snow _Winiaken_.\n\n12. The fish resort to the shores of the gaping sea, where tarried the\nfathers of white eagle and white wolf. _Waplanewa_, _Waptumewi_.\n\n13. While our fathers were always boating and navigating, they saw in the\neast that the snake land was bright and wealthy. (Here begins a fine\npoetical rhyming narrative).\u00e2\u0080\u0094_See Last Note._\n\n14. The head-beaver _Wihlamok_, and the big-bird _Kicholen_, were saying\nto all, let us go to the Snake Island _Akomen_.\n\n15. By going with us, we shall annihilate all the snaking people,\n_Wemaken_.\n\n16. Having all agreed, the northerlings and easterlings, went over the\nwater of the frozen sea to possess that land.\n\n17. It was wonderful when they all went over the smooth deep water of the\nfrozen sea, at the gap of the Snake sea in the great ocean.\n\n18. They were ten thousand in the dark, who all go forth in a single night\nin the dark, to the Snake island of the eastern land _Wapanaki_ in the\nDark, by walking all the people.\u00e2\u0080\u0094OLINI.(27)\n\n19. They were the manly north, the manly east, the manly south; with manly\neagle, manly beaver, manly wolf; with manly hunter, manly priest, manly\nrich; with manly wife, manly daughter, manly dog. (12 words all\nhomophonous rhymes.)\n\n20. All coming there, they tarry at Firland _Shinaking_. But the western\nmen doubtful of the passage, preferred to remain at the old turtle land.\n\nThus end these interesting and positive ancient traditions, by a fine poem\non the passage to America over the ice; the Shawanis have a similar poem:\nthe Illinois had also one, and almost every Linapi tribe. They are perhaps\nlost; but this being at last rescued, will preserve the memory for ever.\nNow begin the second series of songs, in a different style, seldom\nrhyming, but made metrical by an equal number of words in each verse, 4 in\nthe 4 first which carry the tribe till their conquest of the _Talegas_;\nbut only 3 in the 3 later poems on the subsequent history. Thus these\nsongs diminish in details as they advance; but they are mere abridgment of\nbetter annals now probably lost. Numbers shall be annexed to each\nsuccessive king or ruler, so as to compute the generations.\n\n1. _Song. At Shinaki till the 10 Kings or Civil Wars._\n\n1. Long ago, the fathers of men were then at _Shinaki_ or Firland.\n\n2. The path leader was the white eagle (_Wapalanewa 1_), who leads them\nall there.\n\n3. The Snake island was a big land, a fine land, and was explored by them.\n\n4. The friendly souls, the hunting souls, the moving souls, in assembly\nmeet.\n\n5. All say to him, beautiful-head (_Kolawil 2_) be thou king there.\n\n6. The snakes are coming, thou killest some, to Snake hill, let them all\ngo.\n\n7. All the snakes were quite weak, and concealing themselves at the Bear\nhill.\n\n8. After Kolawil, white owl (_Wapagokhos_ 3) was king at the Firland.\n\n9. After him there _Ianotowi_ (4 true maker) was king, and many things he\ndid.\n\n10. After him there _Chilili_ (5 snowbird) was king, who says let us go\nsouth.\n\n11. To spread the fathers of men _Wokenapi_, and to be able to possess\nmuch more.(28)\n\n12. South he goes the snowbird, but east he goes the beaver-he _Tamakwi_.\n(Here is the separation of the Dinnis.)\n\n13. A beautiful land was the south land, the big Firland and the shoreland\n_Shabi-yaki_.\n\n14. But the eastern land was a fish land, and a lake land, and a cattle\nland.\n\n15. After Chilili, the great warrior (_Ayamek_ 6) was king, when all the\ntribes were at war.\n\n16. There was war with the robbing-men, snaking-men, blacking men,\nstrongmen. _Chikonapi_, _Akhonapi_, _Makatapi_, _Assinapi_.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Thus ends the\nfirst song with civil strife and great wars, dividing some tribes\nprobably.\n\n_2d Song. From the 10 Kings till the Missouri &c._\n\n17. After Ayamek came ten kings, in whose time there was much warfare\nsouth and east.(29)\n\n18. After them _Langundowi_ (peaceful-he, 17 kg.) was king at the\nbeautiful land _Akolaking_, and there was peace.(30)\n\n19. After such _Tasukamend_ (never-bad 18) was king, and he was a good or\njust man.\n\n20. After such was king _Pemaholend_ (ever beloved 19) who did much good.\n\n21. King afterwards was _Matemik_ (town builder 20) who built many towns,\nand afterwards the holy goer _Pilsohalin_ 21.\n\n22. King afterwards was _Gunokeni_ (long while fatherly 22, who ruled\nlong) and afterwards the big teeth _Mangipitak_ 23.\n\n23. King afterwards was _Olumapi_ (24 manly recorder or bundler) who\ncaused many writings.(31)\n\n24. King afterwards was _Takwachi_ (25 who shivers with cold) who went\nsouth to the corn land _Minihaking_.\n\n25. King afterwards was _Huminiend_ (26 corn eater) who planted much corn\nthere.\n\n26. King afterwards was _Alkosahit_ (27 preserving keeper) who had a royal\nsoul and was very useful.\n\n27. King afterwards was _Shiwapi_ (28 salt man) and afterwards dry-he\n_Penkwonwi_ 29.\n\n28. There was no raining, and no corn grew, east he goes far from the\nsea.(32)\n\n29. Over hollow mountain _Oligonunk_, at last to eat he went at a fine\nplain _Kalok-waming_ of the cattle land.\n\n30. After _Penkwonwi_ came _Wekwo-chella_ (30 much weary) after such the\nstiff (_Chingalsuwi_ 31.)\n\n31. After such was _Kwitikwund_ (32 the reprover) who was disliked, and\nsome unwilling to obey.\n\n32. Being angry some moved easterly, and secretly went far off.\n\n_3d Song. From the Missouri to the Mississippi &c._\n\n33. But the wise did tarry, and _Waka-holend_ (33 the beloved) was made\nking.\n\n34. It was at the Yellow River _Wisawana_ where there was much corn, large\nmeadows, and again were built towns.(33)\n\n35. All being friends _Tamenend_ (34 affable like a beaver) became king\nand was alone the first.(34)\n\n36. Such Tamenend was the very best, and all the men came to him.\n\n37. After such good _Maskansisil_ (35 strong buffaloe) was king and\nchieftain or leader.\n\n38. _Machigokhos_ (36 big-owl) was king, _Wapkicholen_ (37 white crane)\nwas king.\n\n39. _Wingenund_ (38 mindful) was king and pontiff, who made many\nfestivals.(35)\n\n40. _Lapawin_ (whitened 39) was king, _Wallama_ (40 painted) was king.\n\n41. _Waptiwapit_ (41 white chicken) was king, again there is war north and\nsouth.\n\n42. By the wise in assembly _Tamaskan_ (strong wolf 42) was made king.\n\n43. He was able to war on all and he killed the strong-stone\n_Maskansini_.(36)\n\n44. _Messissuwi_ (43 whole-he) was king and made war on the snake-beings\n_Akowini_.\n\n45. _Chitanwulit_ (44 strong and good) was king and made war on the\nnorthern foes _Lowanuski_.\n\n46. _Alokuwi_ (45 lean he) was king and made war on the father snake\n_Towakon_.\n\n47. _Opekasit_ (46 east-looking) was king, being sad at the warfare.\n\n48. To the sunrise he said let us go, and they are many who together go\neast.\n\n_4th Song. Conquest of the Talegas &c._\n\n49. The fish river _Nemasipi_ separated the land, and being lazy they\ntarry there.(37)\n\n50. _Yagawanend_ (47 hut maker) was king, and the _Tallegewi_ (there\nfound) possessing the east.\n\n51. _Chitanitis_ (48 strong friend) king was, and he desires the rich land\nof the east.\n\n52. To the east some did pass, but the head of the Talegas, _Talegawil_\nkilled some of them.\n\n53. Then of one mind, all say, warfare, warfare.\n\n54. The friends of the north the _Talamatan_ (who are not like the\nTalligewi, the Hurons) were coming to go altogether united.\n\n55. _Kinehepend_ (49 sharp looking) was king, and leader, over the river\nagainst foes.\n\n56. Much was there possessed by them, and much spoiling and killing of the\nTalegas.\n\n57. _Pimokhasuwi_ (50 stirring about) was king, but he found the Talegas\ntoo strong in the war.\n\n58. _Tenchekensit_ (51 opening path) was king, and many towns were given\nup to him.\n\n59. _Paganchihilla_ (52 great fulfiller) was king, and all the Talegas\nwent away to the south.\n\n60. _Hattanwulaton_ (53 he has possession) was king, and all the people\nwere well pleased.\n\n61. South of the lakes they settle the council fire, and the friends\n_Talamatan_ north of the lakes.\n\n62. But they were not always friends and were conspiring when _Gunitakan_\n(54 long mild) was king.\n\n63. _Linniwulamen_ (55 man of truth) was king, and made war on the\nTalamatan.\n\n64. _Shakagapewi_ (56 just and upright) was king, and the Talamatan were\ntrembling.\n\nSECOND SERIES OR MODERN HISTORY.\n\n_1st Song. At the Talega land._\n\n1.

At the East till first White Man comes._\n\n21. This land of the east, was a large land _Amangaki_, and a long land\n_Amigaki_.\n\n22. This land had no snakes, but was a rich land, and many good things\nwere found there.\n\n23. _Gikenopalat_ (73 great warrior) was king near the north.\n\n24. _Hanaholend_ (74 stream loving) was king at the branching stream or\nSusquehanna _Saskwihanang_.(43)\n\n25. _Gattawisi_ (75 becoming fat) was king at the sassafras land _Winaki_.\n\n26.

At this time north and south the _Wapayachik_ came, the white or\neastern moving souls.\n\n60. They were friendly, and came in big bird-ships, who are they?(51)\n\nThus end these poetical annals, so curious and so plain, when properly\nunderstood and translated. The following addition is merely a fragment on\nthe subsequent period, translated by John Burns. I give it as received\nalthough I fear it is inaccurate in some respects, and a paraphrase rather\nthan literal account. Yet by this addition, we obtain a kind of general\nhistory of at least one American tribe, and a complete original series of\ntraditions, in their peculiar pristine style. Many others will be added\nhereafter, either from printed traditions, or historical songs and\nfragments.\n\n_Fragment on the history of the Linapis from about 1600 till 1820._\n\n1. Alas, alas! we know now who they are, these _Wapsinis_ (white people)\nwho then came out of the sea, to rob us of our country. Starving wretches!\nwith smiles they came; but soon became snaking foes.\n\n2. The _Wallamolum_ was written by _Lekhibit_ (the writer) to record our\nglory. Shall I write another to record our fall? No! our foes have taken\ncare to do it; but I speak to thee what they know not or conceal.\n\n3. We have had many other kings since that unhappy time. They were 3 till\nthe friendly _Mikwon_ (Penn) came. _Mattanikum_ (not horned, not\nstrong),(52) when the _Winakoli_(53) came to _Winaki_. _Nahumen_ (raccoon)\nwhen the _Sinalwi_ (Dutch) came. And _Ikwahon_ (fond of women) when the\n_Yankwis_ (English) came, with Mikwon and his friends soon after.\n\n4. They were all received and fed with corn; but no land was ever sold, we\nnever sell any. They were all allowed to dwell with us, to build houses\nand plant corn, as our friends and allies. Because they were hungry, and\nthought children of _Gishaki_ (the sun land) and not snakes nor children\nof snakes.(54)\n\n5. And they were traders, bringing fine new tools, and weapons, and cloth,\nand beads, for which we exchanged skins and shells and corn. And we liked\nthem, with their things, because we thought they were good, and made by\nthe children of _Gishaki_.\n\n6. But alas! they brought also fire guns and fire waters, which burned and\nkilled. Also baubles and trinkets of no use; since we had better ones.\n\n7. And after Mikwon, came the children of _Dolojo-Sakima_ (King George)\nwho said, more land, more land we must have, and no limit could be put to\ntheir steps and increase.\n\n8. But in the north were the children of _Lowi-Sakima_, (King Louis), who\nwere our good friends, allies of our allies, foes of our foes: yet\n_Dolojo_ always wanted to war with them.\n\n9. We had 3 kings after _Mikwon_ came. _Skalichi_ who was another\n_Tamenend_,(55) and _Sasunam Wikwikhon_ (our uncle the builder), and\n_Tatami_ (the beaver taker) who was killed by a _Yankwako_ (English\nsnake), and we vowed revenge.\n\n10. _Netatawis_ (first renewed being) became king of all the nations in\nthe west, again at _Talligewink_ (Ohio or the Talega place) on the river\nCayahaga, with our old allies the _Talamatans_: and he called on all of\nthe east.\n\n11. But _Tadeskung_ was chief in the east at _Mahoning_ and bribed by the\n_Yankwis_: there he was burnt in his house, and many of our people were\nmassacred at _Hickory_ (Lancaster) by the land robbers _Yankwis_.\n\n12. Then we joined our friend _Lowi_ in war against the Yankwis; but they\nwere strong, and they took _Lowanaki_ (north land, Canada) from Lowi, and\ncame to us in _Talegawink_, when peace was made; and we called them big\nknives _Kichikani_.\n\n13. Then _Alimi_ (white-eyes) and _Gelelenund_ (buck killer) were chiefs,\nand all the nations near us were allies under us as our grandchildren\nagain.(56)\n\n14. When the eastern fires were set up, and began to resist Dolojo, they\nsaid we should be another fire with them. But they killed our chiefs\n_Unamiwi_ (turtling) and our brothers on the Muskingum. Then _Hopokan_\n(strong pipe) of the Wolf tribe was made king, and he made war on the\n_Kichikani Yankwis_, and become the ally of Dolojo who was then very\nstrong.\n\n15. But the eastern fires were stronger, they did not take _Lowanaki_\n(Canada) but become free from _Dolojo_. We went to _Wapahani_ (white\nriver) to be further from them; but they follow every where, and we made\nwar on them, till they sent _Makhiakho_ (black snake, General Wayne) who\nmade strong war.(57)\n\n16. We made peace and settle limits. Our next king was _Hacking-Ponskan_\n(hard walker) who was good and peaceful. He would not even join our\nbrothers Shawanis and Ottawas, nor Dolojo in the next war.\n\n17. Yet after the last peace, the _Kichikani-Yankwis_ came in crowds all\naround us, and they want also our lands of _Wapahani_. It was useless to\nresist, because they are getting stronger by increasing united fires.\n\n18. _Kithtilkund_ and _Lapanibi_ (white water) were the chiefs of our two\ntribes, when we resolved to exchange our lands, and return at last beyond\nthe _Masispek_ (muddy water, Mississippi) near to our old country.(58)\n\n19. We shall be near our foes the _Wakon_ (god of snakes, the Ozages) but\nthey are not worse than the _Yankwiakon_ (English snake), who want to\npossess the whole big island.(59)\n\n20. Shall we be free and happy there? at the new _Wapahani_ (western white\nriver). We want rest, and peace, and wisdom.\n\nSuch is one of the accounts of the transactions between this people and\nthe English, United States &c; of which Loskiel, Holm and Hekewelder have\nfurnished other fragments, and for which we have ample materials in the\ncolonial history and late records. But this offers some new views and\nfacts: which shall be partly compared and discussed in the notes; but more\nproperly examined and united in accordance with other narratives, in the\nhistory of the North American nations and tribes. The 11 kings in about\n220 years named in this fragment, indicate 107 altogether till 1820 and\nlater.\n\nThat so many generations and names can be recollected, may appear doubtful\nto some; but when symbolic signs and paintings, with poetical songs, are\nadded, the memory can well retain and perpetuate their connection. Even in\nPolynesia, where we are not told of symbols, but mere historical songs,\nthey reach to the creation and flood; Ellis and Tierman tell us that the\nkings and priests of Tahiti, Ulieta or Raiaka, Hawahi, Mowi &c. could\nrepeat the names of ancestors and kings for 100 generations. It would have\nbeen well if instead of giving us mere fragments of the songs and names,\nthey had translated the whole, and thus furnished the connected annals of\nPolynesia.\n\nIn the Linapi annals, we find not merely their own deeds; but the mention\nof many other nations, friends, allies or foes, as in Cusick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Traditions\nof the Ongwis: and this forms another clue for American history. As early\nas the Asiatic period we find them united to the related people _Owini_\nand _Nijini_, before the flood, and calling their foes _Powako_ (rich\nsnake), _Makowini_ (bad being,) _Maskanako_ (strong snake), similar to the\nsatanic tribes of the Hebrews &c.(60)\n\nAt the flood they are saved with the _Tulapin_ turtlemen, and begin to\ncall themselves _Linapewi_. Soon after they separate, go north and divide\ninto tribes, named after the winds, the mode of life and animals. The\nhunters are _Elowi_ Elohim of the orientals, or Heros and Hercules; they\nagain meet snakemen, who fly to America and must have produced there many\nnations.\n\nAfter having filled the north, and after the breaking of the land, at\nBehring strait, part of the nation resolve to follow and pursue the snakes\nto the east. The passage by the _Olinis_ over the hard sea or ice, is\nbeautifully sung in a peculiar hymn (see last note); they settle at\nShinaki, and begin again to war on snakemen: after which the beaver men or\nTamakwi separate going east where they became the Dinni nations, yet\ncalled beaver tribes, who ascribe their origin to a beaver and a dog, and\ncall their ancestor _Chapewi_, similar to _Apiwi_, the manly in Linapi.\n\nMeantime the main tribe going south meets other nations which it is\ndifficult to identify, as the names are mere epithets and nicknames, yet\nthe _Assinipi_ or stony men, appear to be the Dacota or Sioux yet called\nAssini or stony by the tribes of Linapi origin. They reappear afterwards\nas _Maskan-sini_ or _Sinako_, and appear to have passed to America soon\nafter the Linapi. They are certainly of Asiatic origin, as the languages\nprove, and very akin to the Hurons or Ongwis in America.\n\nThe _Akowini_ are met again, which appear to have become the ancestors of\nthe Cowetas and many Florida tribes. The _Lowanuski_ were either the Uskis\nor the Skeres. The _Towakon_ were not the Ottawas; but probably the Ozages\nor their ancestors the Wakons.(61)\n\nAt last they meet the civilized _Talegas_, who are not called snakes, but\nrather extolled, and from whom they borrowed many things: their symbol is\nvery different from that of the snakes. They were probably of eastern or\natlantic origin, akin to the Tols, Talascas, and Telicos the ancient\nCherokis. The _Talamatan_ become allies, were the Hurons, the name means\nboth _unlike the Talegas_ and _killer of the Talas_.\u00e2\u0080\u0094See Cusick, and my\nHuron Traditions for their own annals.\n\nThe separations of the Nentegos and Shawanis, Mohigans, and Wapanends or\nAbenakis, are distinctly given; they filled the sea shores from Florida to\nAcadia. Three tribes of snakes reappear which are similar to the former,\nexcept the _Lowako_ probably the same as _Lowanuski_. After crossing the\nAlleghanies Tamenend II. reunites all the tribes. The _Hiliniki_ and\n_Conowiki_ easily identified remain west of the mountains. The Iroquois\nand Eries appear under peculiar Linapi names.\n\nThe Otalis and Cowetas appear soon after as snakes or foes; whether the\nOtalis or Cherokis of the mountains were real snakes of the west is\ndoubtful; it is more likely that they are a fragment of the Telicos, which\nwas their capital till lately, and later they are called _Otaliwi_ by the\nLinapis. Compare the Tzuluki traditions with these.\n\nThe Tawas who call themselves fathers, as the Linapi grandfathers, of all\nthe akin tribes, had then towards 1400, a great power in the west: their\nempire had a pontiff _Mushkiwis_ near lake Michigan, on whom Cass has\ngiven some very important traditions.\n\nThe following chief chronological periods are deducible from these annals,\nby reckoning 3 generations in a century. About 1600 years before Christ\npassage of Behring strait on the ice, lead by _Wapalanewa_, settlement at\n_Shinaki_.\n\n1450. _Chilili_ leads them south, and the _Tamakwi_ separate.\n\n1040. Peace after long wars under _Langundewi_ at the land _Akolaking_.\n\n800. Annals written by _Olumapi_.\n\n750. _Takwachi_ leads to _Minihaking_.\n\n650. _Penkwonwi_ leads east over mountains.\n\n460. The first _Tamenend_ great king on the Missouri.\n\n60. _Opekasit_ leads to the Mississippi.\n\nAbout 50 years of our era, alliance with the _Talamatans_ against the\n_Talegas_.\n\n150. Conquest or expulsion of the _Talegas_.\n\n400. _Lekhihitan_ writes the annals.\n\n540. Separation of the Shawanis and Nentegos.\n\n800. _Wapalawikwan_ leads over Alleghany mountains to _Amangaki_.\n\n970. _Wolomenap_ settles the central capital at Trenton, and the Mohigans\nseparate.\n\n1170. Under _Pitenumen_ arrival of _Wapsi_ the first white men or\nEuropeans.\n\n_Additional Note._ As a specimen of the original text and poetry of these\nannals, I give now the poem on the passage to America: the whole text and\nall the symbols will be given hereafter.\n\n13.

He\nwrote them in 1498 by order of Columbus, and they are inserted at large in\nhis life by his son; but were almost neglected by Irving. They give us not\nonly an insight into the belief, religion, traditions of the Antillian\npeople; but also a compendium of fragments on their annals. Although very\ndesultory, much less connected than those of Mexico, the Linapis, Ongwis\n&c., and destitute of chronology; yet they afford an essential addition to\nAmerican history, and the ancient accounts about the Atlantis and\nAntilles.\n\nIn order to bring them into a kind of order, they shall be analyzed,\nreduced to a succession of events and divided into 3 parts, 1. Cosmogony\nand Theogony, 2. the flood and primitive history, 3. ancient history\nprevious to Columbus or 1492. A fourth part foreign to these traditions\nwould be their annals since that time, and till the extinction of the\nnation; which shall be given hereafter, with the account of the language,\nand civilization\u00e2\u0080\u0094What is peculiar to these traditions among the Americans,\nare the metamorphoses of men into beasts &c., as in Ovid.\n\nThe nation who furnished these annals, was the Haytian of Hayti, a branch\nof the nation dwelling also in Cuba, and filling the Lucayes and smaller\nAntilles: whose collective proper name was TAINO meaning noble. But they\nacknowledged as brothers, many tribes of the continent under the\ncollective name of GUATIAOS brothers, this was ascertained in 1520 by\nFigueroa.\u00e2\u0080\u0094(See Herrera.) These _Guatiaos_ were the Aruac nations and\ntribes, that were not cannibals. These tribes as enumerated by Figueroa in\n1520 were in the Antilles the 1. Haytians, 2. Cubans, 3. Jamaicans, 4.\nBoriquans (Porto Rico), 5. Cairis that dwelt in Trinidad, Barbuda,\nMarmagitas and Gianis Islands. While those of the continent were the 1.\nAruacas of Guyana, 2. Paracurias of Cubagua, 3. Urinatos of Oronoc, 4.\nPavonas of Cariaco, 5. Cariatis, 6. Cumanas, 7. Chiribichis, 8.\nCoquibocoa, 9. Unatos. These five last were intermixt with the _Canibas_\nor _Caribas_, the cannibal tribes, foes of the _Guatiaos_, which are the\nGalibis and Carib tribes; that had desolated and conquered most of the\neastern Antilles.\n\nAll the Tainos spoke the same language divided into several dialects; but\nunderstood reciprocally. D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Angleria tells us in 1512 that two distinct\nlanguages were used in Cuba, the eastern was a mere dialect of Hayti; but\nin the west was a very different language not understood; this was the\n_Cami_ derived from the _Olmeca_ of Oaxaca or the _Maya_ of Yucatan; they\nhaving sent there a colony, and founded a kingdom.\u00e2\u0080\u0094(see the Maya History.)\nIn Hayti there was also in the center of the island a kingdom of Mayas?\nthe people were called _Mayo-riexes_ or _Macoryxes_, (meaning _Maya\npeople_). They spoke a language different from the Haytian (Dangleria)\ndivided into 3 dialects _Cayabo_, _Cubaba_, and _Baichagua_. This kingdom\nof strangers was called _Cubaba_ or _Caibaba_, and _Ziguayos_. They are\ncalled Caribs by some authors; but erroneously.(62)\n\nMany other additional traditions on the Antilles are scattered in early\nwriters, D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Angleria, Gomara, Herrera, Munoz, Acosta, St. Mery, Oviedo,\nColumbus, Brigstock, Rochefort, Edwards, Garcia, Laet, &c. which shall be\npartly noticed here as a sequel to Roman, and all connected as a general\noutline of a history of the Antillian nations.\n\nHaving succeeded to make out a fine vocabulary of nearly three hundred\nwords of the Taino dialects, collected from Roman, Columbus, Dangleria,\nMunoz, Las-Casas, Herrera, Gili, Humboldt, Vater &c.\u00e2\u0080\u0094and another of about\n150 words of the _Cairi_ or _Eyeri_ language of the Aruac Islanders out of\nDudley, Rochefort &c. I will be enabled to translate and elucidate nearly\nall the Taino historical names and allusions, so as to clear up the annals\nby original etymologies. The orthography will be Spanish, J must be\npronounced as Kh, and X as Sh.\n\nThe Haytians had besides these songs, other annals; since the priests\ntaught history, and the origin of things to the sons of the nobles. They\nhad also perhaps peculiar symbols to keep their records, since Dangleria\nmentions that they had paintings of beasts, tygers, eagles &c. on cotton,\nhung to walls. St. Mery says that in 1787 was found in the mountains of\nGuanaminto a tomb with a stone of 6 feet covered with hieroglyphs! and in\nthe mountains of Limb\u00c3\u00a9, engravings of human figures on a serpentine rock;\nbesides many sculptures in Caves. Columbus saw in 1492 in Inagua one of\nLucayes a gold medal _with letters on it_! If we had figures of these\nhieroglyphs and engraved symbols, we should probably obtain another clue\nto American history and graphic systems. But they are probably lost by\nneglect like those of North America! The Antilles being on the way from\nthe east to the continent must have served as a stepping place to many\nnations on their passage to the continent.(63)\n\n1st Part.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Theogony and Cosmogony._\n\n1. _Fact._ The Supreme God, bears five names or titles given by Roman and\nDangleria in two dialects, and is male or female.\n\n       By Roman        By Dangleria    Meanings\n1.     Attabei         Attabeira       Unic-Being.\n2.     Jemao           Mamona          Eternal.\n3.     Guacas or       Guaca-rapita    Infinite.\n       Apito\n4.     Apito or        Liella          Omnipotent.\n       Siella\n5.     Zuimaco         Guimazoa        Invisible.\n\nRoman calls it female, Dangleria a male God. The titles of this god are\nsufficient to indicate the supreme God of nature, and they have\nastonishing analogies with the primitive God of Asia and Europe, the\nBasks, Pelasgians, Atlantes, Guanches &c. The most common name was the\nfirst, in Cuba _Atabex_. This and other great Gods were not sculptured in\nidols. The Chillians had similar names for the Supreme God.(64)\n\n2. _Fact._ This God was father or mother of another great God dwelling in\nthe sun with a double name, variable in the dialects.\n\n                  First Name.       Second Name.\nBy Roman          Iocahuna          Guamaarocon.\nBy Dangleria      Iocauna           Guamaonocon.\nIn Cuba           Yocahuna          Guamaoxocoti.\nIn Jamaica        Yocahuna          \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\nIn Boriquen       Iacana            Guamanomocon.\nBy Oviedo         Iovana            Guamamona.\nVariations        Iocavaghama       Guamochyna.\n\nThe explication of these names is not given; but they are identic with the\ngods of the Cantabrians, and Guanches of Canary islands.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The first appears\nto be the JEHOVAH and YAO of the Orientals, and is evidently the HUNAKU or\nSupreme God of the _Mayas_. The second name means _Lord of the World_\n(_Guama-ocon_) and is a title.(65)\n\n3. _Event._ This last God made the World, the Heavens _Turei_, and the\nEarth before the terrestrial sun and moon; also the ZEMIS or angels, who\nare male and female lesser gods, worshipped in idols, and intercessors\nwith the great gods. In the dialects _Zemes_, _Chemes_, _Chemis_.\n\nAll the ancestors are since called _Zemis_: their worship was spread\nthrough America, under various names, and forms: as well as in the east.\nThey are the\n\n_Shemayim_ (Heavenly) of the Hebrews.\n_Shemsia_ of the Pehlavis of Persia.\n_Samana & Hamsa_ of the Hindus.\n_Shams_ of the Arabic.\n_Esmun_, _Saman_ of the old Irish.\n_Eshman_ (devil) of the Carthuls of Caucasus.\n_Sumari_ of Thibet, _Chuman_ of Tartary.\n_Camus_, a synonym of Magi of Persia.\n_Shin_ of the Chinese.\n_Zamzumin_ ancient giants of Arabia.\n_Chamin & Zaones_ of Egypt.\n_Chama_ of the Phrygians.\n_Chamina_ of the Etruscans.\n_Zeones & Zanim_ of the Ammonians.\n_Zamones_ (blest) of the Lybians.\n_Lemes_, _Zanes_ and _Annas_ of the Pelasgians.\n_Chemin_, _Shemsho_, _Naemas_ and _Zamiel_ of Aram or Syria and Phenicia.\n            _Chemarim_ Priests.\n_Zin_, _Kami_ and _Kamona_ of Japan and Yedzo.\n\nWhile in America we find the _Chemim_ of the Carib women.\n\n_Tezmin_ of the Mayas.\n_Inama_ of the Apalachis.\n_Manito_ of the Linapis.\n\n_Camayos_ of the Peruvians.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Which are all identic in meaning _Angels_,\n_Spirits_ and their idols. This name changes elsewhere in sound: just like\n_Enzel_ in Teutonic, which has the import of _El_, _Aones_, and _Zemes_,\nis root of our _Angel_ now pronounced _Endjel_. This oriental connection\nof ideas, names and worship, appears to be evident. They are not less in\n_Turei_ heaven, _Uran_, _Turan_ of the primitive nation &c.\n\n_4th Event._ Some of these ZEMIS became bad beings, and devils _Tuyra_,\nwho send diseases, hurricanes (_Furacan_), earthquakes and thunders to\ndesolate the earth and mankind.\n\nThe names of _Tuyra_ for devil and evil has analogies throughout the\nearth. The most striking are\n\n_Out of America._\n\n_Zitura_ of Basks.\n_Guirati_ of Biscayans.\n_Vetura_ in Bali of Pallis.\n_Tororu_ of Nukahiva island.\n_Yarua_ of the Berber Atlantes.\n_Yurena_ of the Guanches Atlantes.\n_Daruj_, _Puyri_ of Zend.\n_Turug_ of Celts.\n_Tairi_ in Turkish.\n_Tahyri_ of Tahiti.\n_Fara_, _Wara_ of Japan.\n_Tarada_ of the Papuas.\n_Uritiram_ Synonym of Shiva.\n_Teripis_ of Oscans.\n_Tyranos_ of Greeks.\n\n_In America._\n\n_Yares_ of the _Tayronas_ the Cyclops or forgers of Santa Marta.\n_Sura_ of Poyays.\n_Tziri_ of Poconchi.\n_Huraqui_, _Sura_ of Apalachi.\n_Tiviri_ of the Yaquis.\n_Kiuras_ of the Powhatans.\n_Tarahu_, of the Tarahumaras.\n_Prororu_ of Cumana, derived from _Pregonero_ another subsequent devil of\n            Hayti.\n\nBy the change of R to L, we have the _Tulas_ and Atlantes of America.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_See\nTaraguva_ of 10th Event.\n\n_5th Event._ The good Zemis were appointed to make the earth and men, and\nto rule over both. _Guabanzex_, a female Zemis, made the air and water,\nand became the goddess of the ocean and winds.\n\nThis will answer to the first period of the earth creation, when the water\nwas above the land, and the _Rkio_ of Moses was divided. The name appears\nto mean _the windy_.(66)\n\n_6th Event._ The male Zemis JAIA (_Khaya_, the earth) made the earth and\nislands; he is the _Aion_ of Sanchoniation. Every land and island is\nanimated. The island of Hayti was a great animal like a turtle; the head\nand mouth was in the east, the west end of it was a long tail, called\n_Guaca-iarima_ (country of the Vent). The caves were the holes of the\nbody, venerated and used afterwards as temples and tombs.\n\nThis notion, and comparison of islands with turtles, recalls to mind the\nprimitive turtle land of the Chinese, Hindus, Linapis &c. _Jaia_ or _Kaya_\nfor land has affinities all over the world and is a primitive word.(67)\n\n_7th Event._ JAIA afterwards had a son, who was called _Jaia-El_,\n_Higuera_, or _Hibuera_ earth-son gourd.\n\nThis first man like Adam is son of the earth, and an EL or Angel, _Elohim_\nof the orientals; it means in Haytian, son, offspring, family and tribe.\nIt will often recur in subsequent history, in the singular for the plural.\nThe plurals were _Eli_, _Ili_, _guaili_.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Gua_ is only the article _This\nor Such_.(68)\n\n_8th Event._ The sun and moon called _Boiniael_ and _Maroio_ by Roman; but\n_Binthaitel_ and _Marohu_ by Dangleria and Ovieda, come out of the cave\n_Jovovava_: they are Zemis and foes of mankind. A cave with the same name\nwas their temple in Hayti. Dangleria calls it _Iovana-boina_ Jove Solar.\n\nThe exact time of this appearance is doubtful, and there appears to be two\nblended events, one of cosmogony alluding to the sun being long obscured\nby the primitive misty atmosphere, another historical alluding to the\nsolar and lunar dynasties of Asia or America. The meaning of _Jovo-vava_\nor _Kovo-vava_ is cave of fathers, both primitive names. The solar and\nlunar names have many analogies elsewhere, among which the chief are\n\n_Names of the Sun._\n\n_Oin_, _Oein_ of Arabs and Ethiopia.\n_Oboh_, _Baion_, old Egyptian.\n_Baon_, _Oan_ of Assyrians.\n_Ian_ of the Etruscans.\n_Belen_ of the Gauls.\n_Bun_ of the Zend.\n_Abolion_ of the Pelasgians.\n_Abloin_ of the Thessalians.\n_Nti\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a9_ of the Illyrians.\n_Bian_ of the Ausonians.\n_Anactes_ of the Mysians.\n\n_Names of the Moon._\n\n_Yarho_ of the Syrians.\n_Aohri_ of the Tibus.\n\n_Warha_ of the Ethiopians.\n_Carara_ of the Etruscans.\n_Teoro_ of the Betoys, S. A.\n_Heriho_ of Canaan.\n_Humuri_ of Old Arabic.\n_Matuar\u00c3\u00a9_ of Carthul, Caucasus.\n_Maraca_ of Guaramis, S. A.\n_Marama_ of Polynesia.\n_Kamar_ in Maroco.\n_Kamaria_ in Pehlvi.\n_Gumara_ in Nubian.\n\nMost of these synonyms and analogies are found in the most ancient\nlanguages: to which may be added that in the ancient Haikan language of\nArmenia, the sun and moon were called _Noah!_ and _Morante_, names also of\nNoah and his wife.\n\n_9th Event._ The female Zemis, _Coatris-quia_ makes the springs and\nstreams to flow over the earth, and became their goddess.\n\nThis is another period of oriental cosmogony, that of the irruption of\nsubterranean waters and rain, which in the bible is posterior to Adam. The\nname of the Zemis is of doubtful meaning, probably _Coatris-quia_,\nhollow-quite. _Coa_ or _Cua_ was the name of ancient hollow temples all\nover America. _Quia_ is found in _Quisqueia_ oldest name of Hayti or the\n_great_ (land) _universal_.\n\n_10th Event._ _Taragava-el_ and _Corocora_ or _Epileguanita_, two male\nZemis of the woods and hunters, made the trees and beasts. This includes\nprobably two events anterior to the men, unless they be men.\n\nThe meanings of these Zemis which might guide us, are quite doubtful.\n_Taraguva_ resembles _Tuyra_ and also _Turei_ heaven; but _Epileguanita_\nwas probably the ancient god of the _Caracol_ or Beastly-men, since it was\nrepresented by a beast or quadruped; while all the other Zemis as men and\nwomen. _Ili-guanita_ would mean in Haytian _children of the people_.\nTherefore I presume that these are personifications of the ancient\nhunters, or men of the woods with the beastly and savage men of early\ntimes. Roman calls the second _Corocore_, synonyme of _Caracara_.\n\nPart II. _Antidiluvian History and Flood._\n\n_11th Event._ JAIA-EL rebels against his father JAIA and wants to kill\nhim; a warfare, in which _Jaia-El_ is killed by his father, who puts his\nbones into a gourd. _Higuera_, or _Hibuera_, and people the land of that\nname.\n\nThis refers to the fall of man and the wars of the Titans. The name for\nbones is omitted, it would perhaps afford another clue. Many American\nnations venerate and animate bones. Dangleria says, that _Jaia_ peopled\nall the islands of the sea with these bones.\n\n_12th Event._ JAIA being childless marries _Itiba-Jatuvava_ from whom he\nhas 4 twin sons called _Dimivan_, who became afterwards _Cara-cara-cols_\nor the great Cara-cols, the great beastly beings; but their mother dies at\ntheir birth.\n\n_Itiba_ means woman ancient and alludes perhaps to _Thibet_, refuge, or\nland of Noah. (_I_, is the article _the_). _Jatuvava_ perhaps\nJaphet-father, but in Aruac _Kati-uiua_ means the moon heavenly. The name\nof _Dimivan_ is remarkable, being identic with the _Demavends_ or\nantidiluvians of Persia, called _Dawand_ in the Zendavesta, the _Demoi_ or\nold people of the Pelasgians, the _Demons_ of many nations. The _Caras_\nand _Cols_ are found all over America and Asia.(69)\n\n_13th Event._ AHIACAVO (grand father) or _Baia-manicoel_ an ancestor of\nthe _Dimivan_, forms the nation of CON-EL, at _Basamanaco_, and invents\nagriculture, with the art of making cakes and bread.\n\nThe Dimivan acknowledge him as grandfather of mankind. CON-EL is certainly\na personification, meaning the sons or Elohim of CON, who is the primitive\nLybian Hercules KON or KHON; and is found in Peruvian history as the first\nlegislator of Peru. The XONS or CONES were the oldest people of Spain and\nItaly, same as _X\u00c3\u00a2ones_ of Greece. Their god was XON or _Konah_.\n_Basamanaco_ is inexplicable unless it alludes to the primitive\nantidiluvian _Manaco_ or _Manco_ of Peru. _Ba_ is dwelling, _Samana_ an\nisland near Hayti.\n\n_14th Event._ The four brothers _Dimivan_ meeting a mute _Conel_, making\nbread, ask him for some; but he only gives them instead _Cogioba_ or\n_Cohiba_ which is tobacco: this happened at the door of Basamanaco. This\nfable indicates an intercourse of the Dimivans and the _Conels_ which are\nprobably a branch of the Atlantes or Lybians.\n\n_15th Event._ This refusal of bread was the cause of a quarrel and war, in\nwhich _Conel_ kills or destroys one of the brothers or tribes of _Dimivan\nCaracol_, but a turtle _Hicotea_ came out of his body, or an island thus\ncalled, as Hayti was. This _Conel_ conqueror was _Baia-mani-coel_, whose\nname means _Father of food celestial_; but _Baya_ is also the ocean.\n\nThis indicates a great war, and probably alludes to that of the\nAtlantes.(70)\n\n_16th Event._ The _Dimivans_, probably in revenge, broke the gourd of\nJAIAEL (_Khayahel_); but a flood of waters issue from it and drowns the\nland.\n\nThis deluge is called _Niquen_: there is no indication in Roman of the men\nwho were destroyed, nor who were saved and how; but in Cuba was found a\nmore ample tradition of the flood as follows.\n\n_17th Event._ Three Behiques or priests who come to Cuba later, taught\nthem that the flood had been general, had broken the land; and that a good\nman had been saved in a big boat with his family. That many animals were\nalso in the boat, a vulture and dove are mentioned.\n\nHerrera and others relate this, but in different words, and without native\nnames. Some have supposed this account made out by the Spanish priests;\nbut it appears to refer to a tradition brought by the Olmecas or Mayas in\nCuba, being very similar to the Mexican accounts.\n\n_18th Event._ Another subsequent flood although omitted by Roman, is\nalluded to by others, Garcia says that Hayti and Cuba were then cut\nasunder and separated from Yucatan. Dangleria says that the islands\nLucayas that then joined to the great islands, were divided by irruptions\nof the sea. It is the second flood of Peleg, which in the Antilles broke\nthe islands by volcanic explosions. It is impossible to say what events of\nthe next period, may belong to the interval between the two floods; but\nprobably some of them. All these antidiluvian events appear to belong to a\ndifferent country than the Antilles, which did not even then exist, at\nleast in their actual state, and may properly be referred to the island\nAtlantis or the eastern hemisphere. It was at this last cataclysm that the\nAntilles assumed their actual shape and number.\n\nPart III.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Ancient History._\n\n_19th Event._ After the floods the men dwelt in caves on the mountain\n_Cauta_ in the land of _Caanau_ or _Caunana_ or _Caona_.\n\nThe mountains of _Cauta_ must have been the refuge of men at one of the\nfloods: they answer probably to the _Cuta_ of the Hindus, name given to\nmany rocky lands and capes besides mountains. The _Ceuta_ mountain of\nAfrica south of Gibraltar, was one of them, also called _Abyla_ from the\n_Cabyles_ or Nomadic Berbers. Dangleria states a tradition that men were\ncreated on that mountain. _Cauta_ although unexplained is identic with\n_Icota_ turtle, _Ca-uta_ land raised. _Caona_ means golden.\n\nThe land _Caanau_ of Roman, _Caunana_ of Dangleria, has been mistaken for\nthe land of _Canaan_ by some writers: others deem it Florida. Both are\nwrong. The Haytians did not come from North America; but may have sent\ncolonies there. They came from the east, South America and Africa, or the\nAtlantis. The name means land of Noah? (_Caa-Nau_, _Cau-Nana_). _Caunia_\nwas the ancient name of Asia Minor and Caria, the first Carians were\nCaunians, a Pelagian tribe which expelled by the Leleges, settled the\nGrecian islands, and Lybia part of which was called _Caani_. The _Anakim_\nof Syria giants dwelt in _Ca-anak_. The _Khaoni_ were the ancestors of\nEpirians and Illyrians. _Cauni_ was a mauritanian tribe.\n\n_20th Event._ The sun and moon are two great Zemis called _Binthaitel_\n(sun divine) and his wife _Marohu_ (moon), come out of the cave\n_Iovana-boina_ (Jehovah-Solar), and rule the world, establishing the solar\nand lunar dynasties.\n\nThis historical event must be distinguished from the 8th. This refers to\nthe solar dynasties of Asia and Africa. It must be noticed that similar\nplaces were often shown in Hayti, as the same names had been applied by\nthe subsequent settlers, even when the event had happened elsewhere. In\nthis case, these solar caves were temples in Hayti, where the figures of\nthe sun and moon were worshipped, and prayed to for rain; but Herrera says\nthey had their hands bound, which indicates a conquest. Pilgrims went to\nthose caves, from all parts of Hayti. It was in the land of the king\n_Mauziation-El_ (Roman) or _Machiunech_ (Dangleria); but whether these\nwere former dynasties and kings or late rulers, is difficult to ascertain.\n\n_21st Event._ _Maroco-El_ (lunar son) called _Machocha-El_ by Dangleria,\nheld the sway over men, who were still in Cauta and Caanau, and kept them\nconfined to the caves.\n\nThis indicates a lunar dominion over mankind somewhere, and a state of\nconfinement: Perhaps in South America; in Peru caves are also the first\ndwellings of mankind.\n\n_22d Event._ The men were divided into double tribes or two nations, the\nprincipal or largest and of best men was called _Cazibagiaga_\u00e2\u0080\u0094R.\n_Cazibaxagua_\u00e2\u0080\u0094D. (Royal Xagua) and the smaller _Amaianaba_\u00e2\u0080\u0094R.\n_Amayauna_\u00e2\u0080\u0094D. (Mayas?), ruled by Cazics for kings.\n\nWe have here two nations well indicated. The first the _Giaga_ or\n_Shaguas_, indicate the Lunar tribe, the _Chia_ of the Muyzcas, and other\nSouth American tribes _Achaguas_ of Oronoc, the _Chaguays_ or _Changas_ of\nPeru, _Agaches_ or _Agaiz_ or Paraguay; but above all the _Cacha_ or\n_Xauxa_ antidiluvian people of Peru. While in the second we trace again\nthe Amazons or Atlantes, one of their main African tribes being the\n_Amantes_ of Solin, another the _Baniabas_ of Ptolemy, both in Lybia. In\nAmerica the progeny is found in the _Mayas_ of Yucatan, the _Maynas_ of\nEast Peru, the _Mamayant_ of Brazil, the Mbayas of Chaco &c.\n\nThe important name of Cazic for kings begins to appear: it is evidently\noriental, and its affinities will be shown in a note.(71) It is akin also\nto _Kachi_ sun, in the Eyeri dialect: the _Washil_ of the Nachez.\n\n_23d Event._ MACHOCHA-EL was set by the sun to watch the caves, and many\ninhabitants of the caves were killed by the sun, if they came out in the\nday time; they could only come out at night to seek for food. (Dangleria)\n\nThis either alludes to the great heat of the sun in Africa and the\ntropics, or to a dependance of the Lunar or Cave men upon the Solar men.\n_Machocha_ has some affinities in the South American tribes; _Machicuys_\nof Tucumen, _Machacalis_ of Brazil, _Chaehas_ of Perou, _Chanchones_ of\nQuixos &c.\n\n_24th Event._ Some men having dared to come in the day time, were changed\ninto stones by the sun; (_Ziba_ is stone): also _Machokael_ for allowing\nit.\n\nThis fable may allude to a war, between the _Zibas_ stony or strong men\nand the solar tribes. These _Zibas_ were probably the _Zipas_ or princes\nof the Muyzcas. In Perou there is also a fable of men changed to stones at\nthe primitive city of Tiahuanaco, which merely means a war and change of\ndominion. The name of _Ziba_ for stone is primitive.\u00e2\u0080\u0094See the Note for\naffinities.(72)\n\n_25th Event._ Another set of men, going to the shores to fish, were\nchanged into _Joboses_ (myrobolan or plumb trees) by the sun.\n\nThis metamorphose is peculiar to these fables: although the Mexicans\ncalled the Olmecas, fruit-people or Zapotecas. The analogies of _Jobos_ or\n_Kobos_ are found in _Coyba_ of Darien, Cuba or _Coaiba_, the _Mocobis_ of\nChaco &c. Another war is probably meant by this, and the _Jobos_ are a\npeople. Have they any reference with the _Jubas_ of Mauritania? who formed\na divine and royal dynasty there. _Juba_ was also the Jove or God of the\nLybians. Several nations of Central and Mexican America had trees for\nemblems.\n\n_26th Event._ The dynasty of _Giona_ or _Hi-Auna_ begins to rule over the\nmen of Caziba or royal caves in Cauta.\n\nThis family of rulers or Cazics became famous afterwards as we shall see,\nas leaders of tribes to America. We can easily perceive here the ancient\nPelagian tribes of _Ionia_ and _Aones_. _Hi-Auna_ means _the-Aones_. It\nwas this dynasty or people that sent colonies to America: Oviedo says this\nhappened in the time of Hesper 12th king of Spain, about 750 years after\nthe flood, or 1658 years B. C. He deems the settlers Hesperians or\nCantabrians. The root is ONA solar name of Lybians.\n\n_27th Event._ VAGONIANA a ruler of the _Hi-Auna_, went fishing from the\ncave, and became a bird or nightingale; who crossed the sea, and settled\nthe island _Mathinino_ (Martinico) with a people of women. _Dangleria_.\nHis wife in the sea gives him two sons which became jewels _Ziba_ and\n_Guanin_ marble and metal.\n\nThis is a positive voyage over the Atlantic. Whenever we meet tribes of\nbirds, in ancient history, they always mean travellers and colonies, and\noften passage over the sea in sailing boats, compared to birds. The first\nships of the Scandinavians and Europeans seen in North America, were\ncalled birds by the natives. V and B interchange in the Haytian language\nas in Greek; _Va-gon-iana_, thus means _Father-Solar-Iana_. His people are\ncalled women, because unwarlike fishermen, or the Amazon tribe. Martinico\nwas the first island settled by them: it bears the name of _Matinino_ in\nRoman, and was thus called yet in 1492, Garcia mentions the 2 sons and\njewels.(73)\n\n_28th Event._ GUAGU-GIONA king of Caziba, sent _Jadruvaba_ out of the\ncaves, to collect the holy herb _Digo_ in order to purify and wash the\nbody; but he was changed by the sun into a singing bird _Giahuba-Bogiael_\n(the-singer bird-divine), and never returns.\n\nWe have here a second voyage by sea in a bird, and a contention with a\nsolar people, caused by a trading voyage to procure some American\ncommodity: Indigo probably which is identic with _Digo_. _Jadru-vaba_ or\nthe father of _Khadru_, must be a new colonist. _Khadru_ has hardly any\nanalogies in America; but _Giahuba_ in which he was changed has some. It\nappears analagous with the _Yaoy_ and _Shebaoy_ two _Aruac_ tribes of\nGuyana, and thus _Khadru_ might be the _Aruac_ themselves; same nation\nwith the Haytians once, as the languages prove; although extending to\nTucuman and Patagonia. The name of _Aruac_ or _Aruagas_ was inexplicable:\nit may refer to this origin, or to the _Rocou_ the red paint used by them.\nBut _Aruac_ may also mean _Aluac_; akin to the _Labuyu_ of the Caribs\ntheir vassals, and the _Aluez_ vassals of the Nachez nation. Could they\nderive from the ALE angels of the east; here reduced to servitude by foes?\n\n_29th Event._ GUAGU-GIONA irritated that Jadru-vaba does not return,\nleaves the cave of _Caziba_ in search of him, and went with men and women\nto the island Matinino, where the women were left, while the men went to\nthe land of _Guanin_.\n\nThis is the third passage of the Atlantic, unless that of _Vagoniana_ only\nmentioned by Dangleria and Garcia be the same; but they are likely to be\nsuccessive tribes of Ionas. That all the women should be left in Martinico\nis a fable, meaning that the weakest or fishing tribes settled there or in\nthe islands; while the warriors went to the American continent, called\n_Guanin_, which has several meanings, land of Guanas or lizard men, or\nland of metals. It became afterwards the name of a peculiar metal formed\nby the natural or artificial amalgam of 18 parts gold, 6 silver, and 8\ncopper: and a tribe assumed the name. _Guana_ or _Guanos_ was the name of\na large nation of South America; perhaps come from the _Guans_ of the\nCanary islands; but slightly related to the Aruacs by the languages: yet\nperhaps akin: it was spread east of the Andes, between the two\ntropics.(74)\n\n_30th Event._ The children were left behind, because afraid to cross, and\nwere crying after their mothers; but became changed into _Tona_ or\nopossums. Garcia says into _Toa_ or frogs.\n\nThere are no opossums in Hayti nor the small islands, nor in Africa. But\nthey are plenty in South America, where the notion must have sprung. This\nfable and metamorphosis may imply a hidden meaning. The opossums are the\nonly animals bearing their young in a pouch, as ships bear men. Could not\nthis indicate other ships without sails, and thus no longer birds with\nwings?\n\nTON is a remarkable word, since it is the root of _Nei-ton_ the Lybian\nneptunes or navigators. The twin TUN are the holy ancestors of the\nChilians, _Tona-ca_ (flesh our) is the ancestor or Adam of some Mexican\nnations. The frogs were the emblem of the Muyzcas!\n\n_31st Event._ GUABONITO a woman follows _Guaga-Giona_ to the bigland of\n_Guanin_ by swimming. He is well pleased with it, and calls her his own\n_Biberozi_ (wife-loving): but as she was diseased he puts her apart in a\n_Guanara_, where she heals, and he makes her queen.\n\nA singular romantic fable, the disease of the woman is stated to be the\nsyphilis! _Guabo-n\u00e2\u0080\u0099ito_ means fruit or Guava pear of man! The allegory\nimplies another colony following _Guaga_, not by swimming; but with\npaddles or on rafts; probably a part of the lesser tribe of _Amaiuna_ or\nAmazons, so often called women in antiquity; although a powerful African\npeople. All the women left in the islands might be of such a tribe, and\nsince become the Mayas of Yucatan, Hayti &c., with the Manas or Manoas,\nthe Amazons of South America.\n\n_32d Event._ ANACACUGIA (flower of Cacao) brother of this wife or ally of\n_Guaga_, runs away from him on the back of a manati or seal, and goes back\nto the women of Matinino.\n\nThis implies a separation of tribes, one returning to the islands, where\nthey probably formed the Cairi nation. The seal used for boats, is a third\nfable, found in Greece; boats are thus compared to birds, opossums and\nseals. Many American languages animate boats and ships. This seal must\nmean a _Manati_, or sea cow; real seals not being found in the Antilles.\nIf the name was _Manati_, it has affinities with the _Ama-yuna_ or\n_Ama-Zons_ tribe. _Ma-ti-ni-no_ is in Haytian _great-mount-the-good_,\nwhile _Mana-ti_ is _moving mountain_. Has not _Anacacu_ a reference to the\n_Anakim_ of Asia, the _Cacus_ of Europe, and the _Tam-anacu_ of South\nAmerica?\n\n_33d Event._ HI-AUNA father of _Guago-giona_ comes with his son to the\nland of Guanin, and being the grandfather of all the tribes, they receive\nthe names of _Hi-auna_; which is afterwards changed to children of Guanin.\n_Hin Gua-ili Gua-nin_ (the-plural such-children such-Nin), and lastly the\nwhole united nation is called _Guanini_.\n\nThe Aones came then also to America, and there was a confederacy of the\ntribes. _Gua-gu_, _Gua-go_ and _Gua-ga_, may be 3 spellings of a same\nname; but they might also be three successive and distinct tribes of\n_Giona_. _Gua-bonito_ in one instance is made another lord or tribe,\ninstead of a wife of _Guago_.\n\n_34th Event._ ALBEBORA and his son _Al-bebora-El_, were also Guanini lords\nor Cazics, who came with the _Giona_ tribe. This indicates again another\nnation. The name is remarkable, because it resembles _Albion_ and _Bora_,\ntwo primitive nations of the north, which settled England and the boreal\nregions, becoming the Hyper-Boreans of later times. Perhaps these Boras\nare identic with the _Aboras_ and _Aboris_ of ancient Italy, the\nmountaineers since called _Abori-genes_ by the Greeks.\n\n_35th Event._ Another Guaga-giona II. or _Guaba-giona_ is mentioned\nafterwards, whose son became the _Guanini_ tribe.\n\n_Guaba_ means both _the father_ and _the Guava pear_. The succession of\nthese _Gionas_ is very obscure; but many are probably omitted, and the\nwhole poetical records allude to the most famous of the dynasty or nation.\nGuanini implies the Golden tribe.\n\n_36th Event._ The settlement of the Guaninis in Hayti was from Matinino\nand the east; being exiled from Matinino, they are led by _Camo_ who\nbegins the kingdom of _Cabonao_ in Hayti; they settle on the river\n_Bahaboni_, where they built their houses, and afterwards the great temple\nof _Camotzia_. They gave to the island the name of _Quisqueia_ or great\nuniverse; but afterwards _Hayti_, meaning land rough or hilly.\n(Dangleria.)\n\nThis important event is best given with those details by Dangleria: while\nRoman appears to mix it with the settlement of Guanin. Yet _Quisqueia_ was\nmore probably the first name given to South America, rather than to Hayti:\nanother name for which was _Bohio_ or habitations. _Camo_ or _Guamo_ means\nlord or master, _Tzia_ is temple. The exile of the Guaninis from the\nislands, must allude to another revolution and perhaps invasion. This\n_Camo_, was probably the same as the _Cami_ or _Coma_ of Cuba in later\ntime, _Comayagua_ of Honduras; which assimilate the first civilized\nHaytians with the tribes of Central America. It might have happened that\nthese _Camos_ were _Mayas_ and the ancestors of the _Mayo-riexes_. The\nhistory of the Mayas of Otolum, and Central America, will be connected\nwith these annals hereafter; but much is left for conjecture.\n\n_37th Event._ Other exiles of Matinino settle at the island _Cabini_ now\nTurtle island; and near it on the north shore of Hayti, from whence they\nspread through the island, which is called _Bouhi_ or _Bohio_, meaning\nfull of towns.\n\nDangleria mentions this likewise. House and town or habitation, are\nsynonymous in Haytian.\n\n_38th Event._ They found some _Caracoles_ or _Taracolas_, crabs! or\nbeastly men, dwelling in the island. The _Guaninis_ wanting women, took\nsome Caracols beasts for wives, and made them suitable women, by washing\nthem, and giving them to eat the fruit _Inriri Cahuvial_. This was done by\na _Vagoniana_ II. These Caracols had then survived the flood or come\nbefore the Guaninis, the name of the fruit that made them women, if\nexplained, might elucidate this event; but the signification was not\ngiven; another version will suggest other important analogies.(75)\n\n_39th Event._ These Caracols deprived of their women, took other female\nbeasts for wives (another tribe) and from this union most of the Haytians\ndescended, becoming _Anaborias_ or vassals of the Guaninis.\n\n_Anaboria_ means flower or lizard of labor! these might be descended from\n_Albebora_. This name for bondsmen, boors or laborers, was widely spread\nin America, and has affinities all over the world, even with the Latin\nlabor.(76)\n\n_40th Event._ These first inhabitants of Hayti, fed on dates, bananas,\ncocos, fruits, nuts, herbs, yams, roots, onions, mushrooms: until taught\nthe use of Cazabi or bread by _Boition_, with maize, cotton, mandioc &c.\n\nAnother fact of Dangleria, very natural indicating the tropical food of\nold times.\n\n_41st Event._ _Michetauri Guauana_, was the leader of the first colony to\n_Coaibai_ (death house) in the land of _Soraia_ (setting sun), and became\nthe king of it. There the people are called _Goeiz_ (phantoms or ghosts)\nand go about by night; but are not dead people whose name is _Opia_.\n\n_Coaibai_ is either Cuba or Coyba in Darien, or both. It became the\nparadise of the Haytians, placed in Cuba or further west, and a place of\ndelight. The names and allusions are remarkable. They assimilate to those\nof the Greeks &c. about the fortunate islands of the west: those of the\nOrientals and Hebrews about the island _Elisha_, and the _Sheol_ or place\nof souls, the Hebrew Plutonic region. _Soraya_ for setting sun, is identic\nwith _Surya_ of the Hindus: whence came _Syria_ the west, and even our\nword _sorrow_; while _Sol_ comes from Sheol. _Azil_ sun in Pelasgian, is\nakin to _Elisha_ whence our word Azylum! _Goeiz_ is akin to ghost, _Ghaib_\nin Syrian, _Coyocop_ of the Nachez, _Goz_ of the Vilelas. _Opi_ has\naffinities every where. _Michetauri_ is perhaps a synonym of _Machi-tuyra_\ngreat devil, _Guauana_ is such-Auna. Perhaps this fable alludes to an\nanterior event and the passage to America of a former Hi-Auna.(77)\n\n_42d Event._ AUMATEX a great Cazic marries the female Zemi _Guabanzex_,\ngoddess of waters and wind, and she has two sons _Guatauva_ and\n_Pregonero_, who become male Zemis.\n\nIt is impossible to say if this event belongs to this time or to the\ncosmogony. I presume it is historical, alluding to new tribes, and perhaps\nforeign to Hayti. The names are difficult to explain, nor is it stated\nwhat these sons performed; but being sons of water and wind, they must\nhave led colonies by sea elsewhere. They are perhaps the ancestors of the\nGuataios and the Puruays?(78)\n\n_43d Event._ COROCORO the quadruped Zemi of the Caracols? was the ancestor\nof two lines of kings, _Guamorete_ and _Guatabanex_, who rule in Hayti.\nHis temple was in _Sacaba_, and his high-priest was called\n_Cavava-Niovava_. Cave father and our father.\n\nThis alludes to different tribes than the Guaninis: _Coro_ was a tribe in\nCumana. Perhaps this is another version of the 10th Event, or a proper\nindication of the subsequent institutions of the Caracol nation, when more\ncivilized, and become the Mayorex.\n\n_44th Event._ Arrival in Hayti, Cuba &c. of the first _Bohito_ (old man),\na priest and legislator, called _Boition_ by Dangleria, meaning both\n_Priest-solar_ and Old _Ion_: he introduces agriculture and the use of\nbread, divides the nation into 3 castes, _Tainos_, or nobles, _Bohitos_ or\npriests, _Anaborias_ or vassals, and these last into tillers, hunters and\nfishermen. He becomes pontif, settles the religion; establishing mysteries\nand oracles, the worship of Zemis, and many other institutions, holydays,\nfestivals, religious dances, schools &c., declaring the land common to\nall, like the sun and water.\n\nThere are at least 3 Bohitos, that came to Hayti and Cuba, and civilized\nthe people; but it is difficult to distinguish the deeds of each. They\nwere probably priests leading more civilized colonies from the east or\nfrom America. Their name which is variously spelt or varies in dialects\nwas also _Buhuti_, _Boitio_, _Bauti_, _Buhui_, _Boyeto_ &c., is akin to\nthe _Boyez_, _Poyes_, _Piazes_, _Payes_ of South America, used by the\nAruacs, Guaranis and Carib tribes, _Piaches_ of Tamanacs, _Bauti_ of\nDabaiba, _Papas_ of Central America, _Bochica_ of Muyzcas; but the names\nof priests all over ancient eastern nations, have still more\nanalogies(79)\u00e2\u0080\u0094and therefore they came from the east. The civilization and\nreligion introduced or improved by them is also oriental; it was more\nadvanced than we are aware; since they had ample fields and orchards,\nroads and canals, schools in which they taught history, religion, medicine\nand useful arts. Of their astronomy nothing has been preserved, nor of\ntheir hieroglyphs.\n\n_45th Event._ Bohito II. or _Buhui-tihu_ (old eminent) comes and improves\nstill further the rites &c., becoming high-priest. He introduces\nmedicines, charms, the use of cotton and cloth, burning of bodies instead\nof mummies as formerly, the holy herbs _Gueyo_ and _Zochen &c._\n\nThis is all what can be collected on this second law-giver, and he is even\nblended with the next, except by name.\n\n_46th Event._ Bohito III. or _Baio-habao_ (sea-lyre) comes next,\nintroducing music, sacred instruments called after him, and probably the\nrites of the triple named god of the Hindu and Mayan trimurti: _Bugia_,\n_Aiba_ and _Bradama_: who became the Zemi of war, or perhaps led to a war.\n\nThis god with three names is evidently Vishnu, Shiba and Brama of India:\nfound in Yucatan as _Izona_, _Echuah_ and _Bacab_. See my dissertation in\nAtlantic Journal, on similar names of triple God all over America and the\neast. It does not follow that this worship came direct from India; but it\nmight come through the Pelagians, who had it as _Bram_, _Amen_ and _Vix_,\ninverted among the Ausonians, Oscans. The same about a god creator\npreserver and destroyer was prevalent in Asia, Iran, Thibet, Syria, Egypt,\nGreece, Etruria, and even the Canary islands. The Mayoriex came probably\nwith Bohito III.\n\n_47th Event._ Happy state of this civilized people, hardly knowing war,\npassing the time in festivals, dancing, singing and making love: whence\ncalled the Fortunate islands, by the navigators that happened to go so\nfar. They dwelt in wooden houses and had towns of 1000 houses.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Herrera.\n\nThis period is indicated by twenty authentic sources of ancient history,\nand the ancient traditions of Europe about the happy land of the west,\nElisha or Elysium, Hesperides, Cocana of the Spaniards &c.: besides the\nhappy state in which Hayti was found.\u00e2\u0080\u0094See the account of the ancient\nnotions and communications with America, and the great Atlantis: the most\nexplicit is found in Diodorus Siculus, as follows.\n\n_48th Event._ The Phenicians driven by a storm, while going from Gades to\nAfrica, discover the large island ATLANTIS, many days in the ocean west of\nLybia. It was very fruitful, with mountains, large plains and navigable\nrivers; with many woods and fruits, fine valleys, plenty of wild beasts\nand fish. The air is mild and healthful; it is a residence fit for gods:\nthe inhabitants are a strong and healthful people; they have many towns,\nwith stately buildings, houses of pleasures, gardens, orchards &c.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Diod.\nBook V.\n\nThe translators of Diodorus have blundered so far as to deem this island\nMadeira or the Canaries; which are small islands, without streams, and the\nfirst without inhabitants. It can only apply to Hayti, or even the\ncontinent of South America.\n\n_49th Event._ _A black people_ came to Hayti from the south or south-east,\nwho had darts of Guanin metal, and were called the Black Guaninis.\n\nThis tradition preserved by Herrera, Garcia and Charlevoix, indicates a\ncolony of _Negroes_ or men painting black, from South America. They might\nbe the black Negroes of Quarequa mentioned by Dangleria, or some other\nAmerican Negro nation, of which there are many.\u00e2\u0080\u0094See my account of ancient\nBlack Nations of America. Dangleria mentions two wild tribes of savages in\nHayti towards 1500, one speechless! (which means they spoke a different\nlanguage) probably a remain of the Caracols, another swift dwelling in\ncaves, quite apart, seen in 1514 in Zauana of Guacarima.\n\n_50th Event._ Navigations of the Haytians and Cubans, settlements of the\nLucayas islands, Jamaica, and probably some parts of Florida: mutual trade\nwith Cuba and the continent.\n\nThese colonial and trading voyages must have begun long before and have\nbeen continual. Columbus met individuals in Cuba who had visited Hayti,\nJamaica and Yamaya, the Maya land or Yucatan. _Yucayas_ or Lucayans knew\nCuba, Hayti and Florida, which was called _Cautio_ says Fulgar, quoted by\nCardenas, who deems the Antilles peopled from hence, blending it with\n_Cauta_ the original seat of the Haytians. South America was once called\n_Guanin_, afterwards _Caribana_ when it was overspread by the Carib\ntribes. The Nachez appear to have come from Cuba. The Cumanas knew Hayti\nand called it _Atsi_.\n\n_51st Event._ The _Canibas_ (whence our Canibals) or the _Caribas_,\n(whence our Caraibes), a savage people, often feeding on human flesh,\nbegin to spread to Guyana and South America; becoming bold navigators\nalso, they send war parties and colonies to the peaceful islands of the\nAntilles, and even to Florida.\n\nThe Caribas evidently descended from the Galibis, and other akin nations\nof South America, did not originate in North America, as supposed by\nBridgstock and a few others. Laborde who spent 20 years with them, and\nknew well their language, has published some of their traditions in 1704.\n_Lon-quo_ was their original god, who made _Racumon_ their chief or leader\nto America, who leads there the tribes of snakes, men, Cabatos-trees and\nbirds. The true name of the nation was _Cali_, those of the main were\n_Cali-nago_ or _Calibis_, of the islands _Cali-ponam_. Rochefort &c.\u00e2\u0080\u0094See\nmy Carib Traditions.\n\n_52d Event._ The Calibis of Guyana after long wars with _Alouague_ the\nkings of the _Aruacas_, send the general _Timani_ to conquer the Aruacas\nIslanders, _Cahiris_, _Eyeris_ &c. who leads the tribe of _Labouyous_\n(vassals) and conquer several islands, killing the men and keeping the\nwomen.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Rochefort &c.\n\nThe period of this invasion is unknown; those who bring the Caribs from\nNorth America, make it much later of course; but it is likely to be an old\nevent: although several invasions are probably meant and blended. The\n_Timanis_ and _Labouyous_ must have effected this. They adopted many\ncustoms and partly the religion of the conquered women. The following\ntradition belongs probably to the conquered Eyeris.\n\n_53d Event._ Once when living wretched and on the spontaneous fruits of\nthe earth, _Oubek-Eyeri_ (heaven man) a holy man drest all in white\ncotton, comes from heaven (_Oubek_ above). He first appears to a desolate\nold man _Boyez_, and teach him to build houses, to cultivate mandioc and\nmake bread of it &c.\n\nThis must have been a priest or bohito of Hayti, who tried to civilize the\nCaribs: unless it refers to anterior traditions. He taught religion also,\nthat good men would go after death to the happy islands of the west, and\nbecome _Chemin_ or _Icheiri_ Zemis; while bad men should become _Oumekoua_\nwanderers at sea, and _Mabouyas_ devils.\n\n_54th Event._ The Caribas in search of these fortunate islands go to Hayti\nand Cuba; but are repulsed, and settle in Florida, where they extended\ninland, becoming the tribes of _Cofachi_, _Matica_ and _Amana_. They dwell\nthere a long while often at war with the Apalachis, who conquer them and\nincorporate at last.\n\nSee Brigstock for this fact, and the wars with the Apalachis; the details\nbelong to the history of North America and the nations of Florida.\n\n_55th Event._ Some expelled Caribs hearing by traders of Zigateo, steal\nsome canos and run away to this island, one of the Lucayas; well received;\nbut sent to Ayay (Santa Cruz) desert island, where they settle and\nincrease. This happened towards 1150 of our era.\n\nThis positive fact begins the certain chronology of the Antilles; but\nBrigstock is quite wrong in deeming these fugitives, the ancestors of all\nthe Carib and Galibis tribes as far as Brazil.\n\n_56th Event._ Civil wars in Hayti, attempt of some kings to become\nindependent from the _Bohitos_ government. The Cazic _Guamaretus_ despise\nhis god or Zemi _Corochotum_, for which he is overcome in battle and his\npalace burnt. Dangleria.\n\nThis indicates probably a revolution, and attempt to overthrow the ancient\nreligion, perhaps before 1150.\n\n_57th Event._ CAZI-BAQUEL restores peace, and the worship of the great God\n_Jocavaghama_, with the Zemi _Tarugavael_ found in the woods. Meantime the\ngod JOCAVA prophecies by an oracle that the _Maguacochios_ (great people\nclothed) would come, with fire and thunder to destroy or enslave the\nrebellious Haytians. This was understood to apply to the Caribs, and\nSpaniards afterwards.(80)\n\n_58th Event._ This great king BAQUEL, begins a dynasty, and has many\nsuccessors _Gamanacoel_, _Guarionel_, _Guayaronel_, _Guavanenechin_,\n_Guavavo-conel_, _Caramarex_, _Guaramatex &c._, who are the chief kings of\nHayti. _Guarionex_ was his successor when the Spaniards came.\n\nThe ancestors of Guarionex had been kings or cazics from time immemorial\nin the great kingdom and valley of Maguana, 180 miles long and 30 broad,\nrunning from east to west; having from east to west the provinces\nCanobocoa, Hubabo, Cayaba, Maricoa, Bainoa. The river Bahuan runs through\nit, which is probably the same as Bahaboni, where settled the Guaninis.\nThey appear to have been at the head of the feodal system of Cazics and\nTainos established in Hayti. All the other kings bearing them allegiance:\nand their dialect was the court language.\n\n_59th Event._ The island becomes divided into 5 principal kingdoms, with\nmany provinces each having a Cazic. They were 1. _Caizimu_ in the east\nwith 11 provinces, Higuey was the first of them, 2. _Bainoa_ in the\ncentre, the largest of all, belonging to the _Baquel_ dynasty, with 24\nprovinces, Maguana being the first of them, 3. _Guacarima_, the west end,\nwith 12 provinces, Xaragua being the main, 4. _Hubaba_, a small kingdom\nwith 3 provinces in the south mountains, 5. _Cotoy_ or _Cayabo_ in the\nmountains of the north, held by the _Mayoriex_ people, with 7 provinces,\nand the mountains Zibao.\n\nDangleria gives the names of all these provinces, but he has omitted the\nkingdom of _Marien_ in the north-west, he makes it only a province of\nBainoa. Laet, Charlevoix and Munoz have given maps of old Hayti, with the\nsituations of many, the rivers, towns, islands, mountains, lakes &c.; see\nmy Ancient Geography of the Antilles.\n\n_60th Event._ Meantime Cuba was also divided into 7 kingdoms, 1. _Mayzi_\nor _Maiti_ opposite Hayti, 2. _Bayamo_ west of it, 3. _Cueyba_ in the\ncentre, whence the name of _Cuba_, probably the head kingdom, 4.\n_Camayegua_ or _Camaguey_ inhabited by a different people, famous tribe,\nprobably _Comayaguas_ of Honduras, or Olmecas, 5. _Xagua_ near the middle,\n6. _Macaca_ in the south opposite Jamaica, 7. _Haniguanica_ at the west\nend where are the high mountains _Uhima_.\n\n_61st Event._ The island of Jamaica was divided in two kingdoms. Boriquen\nalso Buchena or Burichina (D) now Porto-Rico, formed one, but had 26\nCazics in as many valleys, the high mountains of Guayamo being desert. The\n_Yucayas_ (white islands) now Bahama, were numberless, the largest being\nAmana, Zigateo, Bahama, Bimini, Sumana, Yuma, Guanahani, Saomoto, Abaco\n&c. The Cazics were much respected there, being also Bohitos or Behiques\n(priests) judges and stewards. Labor was in common and the daily food\ngiven from the public stores. Some islands were at war; but only used\nsticks in their quarrels. Yet all the islands formed a single kingdom, the\ngreat Cazic resided at Saomoto.\n\n_62d Event._ The Caribas of Ayay having multiplied, spread again over the\neastern islands: they are repulsed in Boriquen; but meeting their ancient\ntribes in _Curucueria_ now Guadeloupe: it becomes their chief island:\nwhence they send war parties to 1000 miles off, even to the continent; and\noccupy _Galana_ now Marigalante, _Matinino_ or _Madinino_ now Martinique,\n_Liamaca_ now Antigua, _Liamuiga_ St. Christopher, _Bayaraco_ St. Vincent,\n_Bequia_ Grenada &c. called collectively _Caliaqua_ the islands of the\nCalibis.\n\n_63d Event._ They molest the shores of Boriquen, where they are always\nrepulsed, but often steal men and children to eat them.\n\n_64th Event._ They assail the shores of Hayti, where they are much feared;\nsignals by smoke are made when they appear. In Higuey and Caizimu, eastern\nregions of the island, the Haytians become warlike to defend themselves,\nand use poisoned arrows as they did. Elsewhere the Haytians used only\ndarts, lances and macanas, peculiar wooden swords.\n\n_65th Event._ The Caribs went as far as the shores of Cuba, and desolated\nthe south shores: the Cubans removing their towns inland. They were called\nCanibas and Canimas: and succeed in forming a settlement at Baracoa to the\nsouth-east.\n\n_66th Event._ They were repulsed in their attempt against the warlike\nJamaicans who used arrows; they do not appear to have molested the\nYucayans, owing to their former alliance and gift of the island Ayay.\n\nThese events are chiefly collected from Columbus\u00e2\u0080\u0099 own account, and\npersonal narratives of his travels, with other retrospective hints by the\nSpanish writers. They will also afford the notices of the subsequent\nevents.\n\n_67th Event._ The population of all the Tainos in the Antilles was at\nleast two millions; 1,200,000 in Hayti; 600,000 in Cuba; 100,000 in\nBoriquen; 60,000 in Jamaica; 40,000 in the Yucayas; besides the unknown\nCarib population.\n\nThis is the least calculation, at the Spanish arrival: others have swelled\nit to 6 millions, including all the West Indies. Las-Casas states that the\nLucayas had 500,000, Jamaica and Boriquen 600,000.\n\n_68th Event._ The domestic animals of these islands, were among beasts,\nAlco dogs, gochi-dogs, agutis, cavias, pecari hogs and manatis: turtles\nand guanas among reptiles: parrots, doves, partridges, fowls, ducks and\nred cranes among birds: remoras among fishes; and even cucuyos or fire\nflies used for lamps among insects.\n\nSuch were found either in one or all the islands; which were not therefore\ndestitute of domestic animals, as commonly believed. Columbus found tame\nfowls at Cuba in 1492; which were probably the Powis fowls.\n\n_69th Event._ Beroica was king of Jamaica (about the year 1420) he began a\ndynasty; his two successors were Bemberoica and _Abem-beroica_, meaning\nBeroica II., Beroica III.\n\nGarcia states this fact; but in 1503 Columbus found Ameyro Cazic of the\neast, and Huarco of the west of Jamaica.\n\n_70th Event._ The island Puta or Cahiri now Trinidad at the furthest east\nend of the Antilles was still inhabited by several Aruac tribes, Cahiris,\nYaoy &c. which resisted the inroads of their constant foes the Galibis and\nCaribas.\n\n_71st Event._ Between 1450 and 1480 Guaramatex was the greatest king and\nCazic of Hayti, in Bainoa and Maguana.\n\n_72d Event._ Cayacoa was king of Caizimu and Higuey in the east from about\n1460 to 1494 when he died.\n\n_73d Event._ About 1470 some Caribs settle in Samana, the east peninsula\nof Hayti; and two valiant brothers Caonabo and Manicatex, form themselves\na small kingdom inland near to the Mayoriex nation, Mayo-banex their king\nadmits them as allies. Caonabo conquers 3 provinces, Dahabon, Zibaho and\nManababo. He was so much esteemed for his valor, that Anacoana the Venus\nof Hayti, sister of the king of Xaragua, becomes his wife soon after.(81)\n\n_74th Event._ About 1475, Behechio is king of Guacarima in the west, till\n1500. His capital was Xaragua. He became a conqueror of several provinces,\nas far as Neyba and Ozama rivers. He had 32 vassal Cazics, and 30 wives,\nhis favorite queen was Guanahata.\n\nDangleria calls him Beuchicus Anaca-choa, and says that as usual with\ngreat kings, he received many titles, being called Shining Copper, Bright\nHighness, and Rich Flood. These titles were really\n\n_Tureigua hobin_, Heaven-like of Yellow Copper.\n_Siarei-huibo_, Star-bright Highness.\n_Duyh-zinequen_, Wealthy in Streams.\n\n_75th Event._ In 1480 Guarionex succeeds Guaramatex as the greatest king\nof Hayti.\n\n_76th Event._ In 1486 the Cubans send a colony to Florida, in search of a\nriver and spring restoring to youth; they visit the _Pola_ islands, now\nMartyrs or Florida keys, the _Colas_ nation of South Florida, and settle\nthe town of Abaiba near the cape of Florida.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Herrera.(82)\n\nThis proves a previous trade and knowledge of Florida. The _Colas_ are\nperhaps descendants of the ancient Cara-_Cols_ of Hayti: they dwelt in\nFlorida till 1760, when they removed to Cuba.\n\n_77th Event._ In 1490 and previous to it, war in Cuba between the kingdom\nof Cuba or Colba, and Cavilla king of the _Cami_ nation, in the country of\nBafan, whose capital was Fava.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Columbus\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Narrative._\n\nColumbus heard of this war in 1492. The _Cami_ are the same as the\nCama-yegua, the foreign people of Cuba.(83)\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\n    THE HAYTIAN OR TAINO LANGUAGE _restored, with fragments of the\n    dialects of Cuba, Jamaica, Lucayas, Boriquen, Eyeri, Cairi,\n    Araguas. Grammar, roots, and comparative Vocabularies._\n\n\nAt an early period I endeavored to collect all the scattered fragments of\nthis language, in order to elucidate and support the historical\ntraditions. This labour concluded in 1828, has given very important\nresults, which shall now be explained. At the time of the Spanish\ndiscovery and conquest, many Spaniards spoke that language; many slaves\nwere sent to Spain; but philology was not then attended to. Therefore we\nhave no dictionary nor grammar of this language. Meantime the very nation\nhas disappeared, destroyed by Spanish cruelty.\n\nHowever, nearly all the early travellers and writers on the West Indies\nhave preserved by chance, some words of it. Columbus himself mentions some\nof them in his original journal. Roman and Dangleria explain many of the\nquoted words. Others are scattered in Acosta, Gomara, Oviedo, Garcia,\nDiaz, Las-Casas &c.; which had never been all collected even by Vater nor\nEdwards. Gili alone undertook to give a long list of Haytian words; but\nthree-fourths of them are geographical or historical names unexplained and\nunavailable.\n\nI have used, compared and brought together all these loose materials, and\nthus succeeded in restoring about 234 words of this language, a list ample\nenough for all historical purposes. This contains besides 50 words of the\nEyeri and eastern dialects, with 38 of the Cuban or western dialects,\nuseful to show the variations of dialects. We know that from Bahama to\nCuba, Boriquen to Jamaica, a same language was spoken in various slight\ndialects, but understood by all: Columbus himself says so.\n\nBut this language, which had also partly spread in Florida, and in South\nAmerica, has the appearance of being a mixt speech. This appears from the\nmany synonyms, the deviations of dialects, and the double forms, or\nrelative position of words. In the small eastern islands the _Eyeris_ or\n_Cabres_ had been destroyed by the Caribs, who preserved the women, and\nthese preserved their own language, mixt with some Carib words and taught\nit to their daughters; so as to produce a double language, that of the\nwomen being quite peculiar. This singular fact well authenticated, will\nenable us to presume a similar conquest and custom, wherever we shall meet\nin America, with a peculiar female idiom.\n\nThe many nations or tribes mentioned in the traditions, which had\ngradually amalgamated; and the settlement in Cuba and Hayti of the Mayas,\nwill account for this mixture of synonyms. But the existence also of many\nhomonyms, leads us to a former more simple speech, probably monosyllabic\nand quite regular as the oriental idioms, to which it is most akin.\n\nFrom the primitive languages of North Africa and South Europe, it had\nreceived this regular position of ideas; but by the mixture with the Maya\nand Mexican nations using the inverse form, it borrowed that new form. The\nsame happened in Europe to the Celtic and Oriental tribes, who received in\nGreece and Italy the inverse form of speech from the Scythian, Illyrian\nand Gothic tribes.\n\nThe comparative examination of the Haytian and dialects, was pursued by\nme, _upon all the languages of the earth_, as I was determined that one\nAmerican nation at least, should be traced philologically to its real\norigin. Thus I found many thousand analogies of it, out of which I have\nused about 1500 in the annals, notes and vocabularies. A single American\nlanguage does then contain more comparative analogies in about 200 words\nthan all those collected by Vater and Malte, out of 400 American\nlanguages; and this fact upsets all the illusions, theories and false\nviews, based thereon by them, Humboldt and others.\n\nBut this comprehensive labour teaches other facts, by far more important\nand available. 1. That American languages have analogies with all the\nlanguages of the earth, 2. That they have similar analogies with each\nother, 3. That it is only the superior number of analogies that may\nindicate a filial or parental connection out of America, 4. And that also\nsimilar greatest number of analogies, indicate the parental relations of\nAmerican languages and nations between themselves, 5. Lastly that unless a\nlanguage and nation is compared _with all the others_, we can never\nascertain accurately, nor trace its real parentage philologically.\n\nThis consequence is obvious, although it will not please the lazy or timid\nphilologists and historians. It shall be further pursued and elucidated\nhereafter; but now let us apply these rules to the Haytian.\n\nI could give 400 comparisons. Let us select a few.\n\n1. _Ainu of Choka_ islands between Japan and _Kamchatka_, 22 comparable\nwords 4 alike in Haytian\u00e2\u0080\u0094Boat, house, no, drink\u00e2\u0080\u0094Mutual affinity only 21\nper cent. No parentage.\n\n2. _Singala_ of Ceylon, 50 comparable words, 16 analogies, with\nHaytian\u00e2\u0080\u0094Mutual affinity 32 per cent. Very distant parentage.\n\n3. _Guanch_ of the Canary island nearest to Hayti in the east, 32\ncomparable words, 14 akin. Mutual affinity 42 per cent. Distant\nconnection.\n\n4. _Mandara._ Handsome black nation in the centre of Africa, 12 words\ncomparable, 6 akin,\u00e2\u0080\u0094one, water, man, king, mother, river\u00e2\u0080\u0094Mutual analogies\n50 per cent. Nearer connection than with the Guanch, or separation less\nremote.\n\n5. _Pelagic_, or ancestors of the Greeks and Italians. Comparable words in\nall the ancient and modern dialects nearly 200, whereof about 160 offer\nmore or less analogies!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Mutual affinity 80 per cent! Complete and near\nconnection.\n\n_Therefore the Haytians are of Pelagic origin!_ No other group of\nlanguages offer anything like as many. The nearest after, are the Atlantic\nL. Lybian, Egyptian, Bask, Sanscrit, Persian &c. who are all connected\nwith the Pelagic nations. The analogies with the Tartars, Chinese,\nPolynesians &c., are all less in amount.\n\nIn America the Haytian affinities are of course the greatest with the\n_Aruac_ nations of South America; who are their brothers, and extend to\nthe Taos of Tucuman and the Tinguis or true Patagons of Pigafetta. Yet\nthey may have been divided long ago, or ever since their American\nsettlement: since out of two selected for comparisons, after the\nvocabularies, the _Araguas_ had only 70 per cent of analogy, and the\n_Cairi_ only 56 per cent. The nearest affinities after these, were with\nthe _Apalachis_, _Nachez_, _Cadoz_, _Huastecas_, _Mexican_, _Tarasca_,\n_Maya_, _Chontal_ &c. of N. America, and the _Darien_, _Betoy_,\n_Peruvian_, _Chili_, _Mbaya &c._ of South America.\n\nThose with the nations of N. America of Asiatic origin, and the nations of\nSouth America of African origin, such as the Linapis and Guaranis, were\nmuch reduced. See the compared vocabularies.\n\nThe Haytian shall now become therefore one of the touchstones of other\nAmerican languages, to verify their eastern or Atlantic origin, and above\nall the connection with the American Pelagians.\n\nLet us now consider the forms and peculiarities of this interesting\nlanguage, and first its phonology.\n\nIt appears to have all the sounds of the Italic languages; but it lacks\nthe Greek TH, PS, the Cairi had _TH_. It has been written by Spaniards,\nand their simple orthography applies well to it; but leaves a doubt\nwhether it had the Celtic and French \u00c3\u00bb (unless it be y) Hebrew and English\nSH, lacking in Spanish. Their CH is as in English, and the French TCH.\u00e2\u0080\u0094It\nhad the gutural X of the Greeks and Spanish, written X and J. Also the\nSpanish LL, GN or \u00c3\u0091, and TZ.\n\nIt had few P being changed to B; few F often changed to V; few L changing\nto Y; few S changed to Z; few D changed to T.\u00e2\u0080\u0094It had no nasal sounds as in\nItalian, AN becoming _Ana_ &c. Many dipthongs AO, OEI, IA, AI, UA, AU, EI\n&c. as in Italian, each vowel sounded. This made the language soft,\npleasing and musical as in Italian and Polynesian. Dangleria says the\naccent was always on the last syllable, as in French.\n\nOn the grammar of it, nothing has been written; what Vater has said is\nquite loose and inaccurate. We have not even the _Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Prayer_ in it, so\nas to serve as a model. Our only guides are a few translated phrases of\nRoman and Dangleria; but they enable us to perceive the main features of\nit.\n\nOne of the chief was the great use of articles, as in Italian; but with a\npeculiar one GUA, put commonly before, but sometimes after the nouns. It\nwas a demonstrative article, meaning _such_, or _this_, _that_, _these_,\n_those_; but never changing and common as our _The_: while this indicative\n_The_ was declinable or changing as in the Italic languages, and extremely\nvarious, although always prefixed, expressed by I, HI, HIN, NI, N\u00e2\u0080\u0099, ZI, LI\n&c. A third kind of article was O, which when added, appears to have been\ncomparative, and to mean _Akin_, _Like_, _Similar_, or our English AS. The\nrelative article _Of_ was A prefixed.\n\nExamples of Articles.\n\n_Gua-yava_ This pear.\n_Gua-ma_ This great, or lord.\n_Gua-tiaos_ Those brothers.\n_Ma-za-gua_ Great plain such.\n_Bala-gua_ Sea such, the ocean.\n_I-Guana_ The guana or lizard.\n_Ni-taino_ The good or noble.\n_Mi-taino_ My noble lord.\n_Li-ani_ The wife. Eyeri dialect.\n_Hin-Guaili_ The such-sons, the children.\n_Ziba o_ Stone like, stony.\n_A-na_ Of bloom, a flower.\n_A-boria_ Of labor, a vassal.\n_A-maca_ Of wood, a bed.\n_A-ma_ Of great, water.\n_A-reiti_ Of rite, song.\n\nThese articles formed probably the declinations of nouns, as we do not\nperceive a different desinense. This form was more like the Celtic, Oscan,\nand Greek, than the Latin.\n\nThe feminine was formed nearly as in Italian, O changing to A.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Taino_,\n_Taina_, Lord, Lady\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Hito_, _Hita_, Man, Woman; but there must have been\nirregularities difficult to trace: as some words masculine end in I, S, N,\nU, L. Perhaps some were neutral.\n\nSome words are formed by duplication, implying an amplitude, as in the\nOriental language.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Bi_ life, _Bibi_ mother and wife in dialects. _Ba_\nhabitation, _Baba_, _Vava_ Father. _Ma_ great, _Mama_ mother. _Xau_ cake,\n_Xauxau_ bread or large cake.\n\nThe plurals are chiefly in I as in Italian, or in S as in Spanish; but\nthere are some irregular plurals. _Taino_, _Taini_, Lord, Lords. _Hito_,\n_hitos_ man, men.\n\nEL son. ILI sons. _Zemi_ angel, _Zemes_ angels.\n\nThe Eyeri dialect forms many plurals in UM. _Eyeri_ man, _Eyerium_ men;\n_Inaru_ woman, _Inayum_ women.\n\nThe adjectives are put before or after the substantives, blending the two\nforms; and the prevailing form in compound words is doubtful, perhaps the\nregular as in Latin.\n\nExamples of regular position.\n\n_Hay-ti_ Land-high.\n_Ana-caona_ Flower (of) gold.\n_Buhui-tihu_ Priest high or eminent.\n\nExamples of inverse positions.\n\n_Bo-hito_ Old man or priest.\n_Jaya-el_ Earth-son.\n_N\u00e2\u0080\u0099abor-itas_ The working men.\n\nThe adjectives are chiefly formed from nouns, and often by a simple O\nadded, thus _Ziba_ stone, _Zibao_ stony, _Zibayo_ mount.\n\n_Turei_ heaven, _Tureigua_ heavenly or heaven-like.\n\n_Duhos_ wealth, _Duihzi_ wealthy or wealth-is.\n\nThe superlatives are commonly formed by duplication. _Ua_ old, _Uaua_ very\nold. _Co_ fruitful, _Coco_ very fruitful, the coco nut.\n\nOr else by the affix _Ma_ which amplifies every thing.\n\nThe pronouns appear very simple.\n\nMI, M\u00e2\u0080\u0099 first person for I, me, my, mine; but _our_ is _Ahia_?\n\nTI, T\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Second person for thee, thou, thy, thine.\n\nLI, L\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Third person for he, she, his, her.\n\nNI, N\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Common like _It_ or rather _On_ of the French.\n\nHow their plurals are formed, is doubtful; but perhaps the inflexions\nalone formed them. These pronouns are pure Italian! or rather primitive.\nThey were often dispensed with as in Italian.\n\nOf the verbs we know little or nothing. By a few examples of the verb _to\nbe_, it was quite irregular as with us.\n\n_Ei_ To be\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Tei_ be thou\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Bei_ being.\n_Beira_ a being\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Dacha_ I am.\n_El_ he is\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Zi_ it is, this is.\n\nIn these _Ei_ appears the root, derives from _Eil_, and was then similar\nto _El_ son, as _Zi_ to _Izi_ eyes.\n\nThis verb joined to others was added to words. _Guarocoel_ we know he is,\nmay be analyzed _Gua-roco-el_ such-know-he-is.\n\nWe have an example of negative verbs in _Macabuca_ I do not care, which is\n_Macabuca_ not-care, or never-mind; in French _n\u00e2\u0080\u0099importe_, in Italian _non\ncuro_.\n\nOf the syntax we may form an idea by the few preserved phrases; which I\nhave analyzed as follow, and compared with the Italian.\n\n1. _Teitoca_ thou be quiet. _Tacitu_ Italian.\n_tocheta_ much. _molto._\n_zinato_ angry. _irato._\n_Guame-chyna_ this great God. _gran-Nume._\n\n2. _Gua-ibba_ that go. _Vai_ It.\n_zinato_ angry. _irato._\n_macabuca_ not care. _non curo._\n\n3. _Dios_ Spanish God. _Dio_ It.\n_Aboria_ Servant. _Servo._\n_dacha_ I am. _Sono._\n\nThis idiom or position of words is perfect in Italian which admits of many\ntranspositions; but in English syntax and idiom these phrases mean\n\n1. Be quiet, God will be very angry.\n2. Begone, I do not care if he is angry.\n3. I am the servant of the Spanish God.\n\nThe Haytian numbers have not been transmitted to us, and I could only\ncollect the following secondary numbers\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Ata_ first, _Bem_ second, _Abem_\nthird: which however are primitive and indicate a binary numeration:\nalthough the language had probably the decimals.\n\nBy a careful analytical process I have been able to decompose the compound\nwords, and even reach their monosyllabic roots. All the long words can be\nthus analyzed, and show that this compound form only arises, as usual in\nAmerican languages, by the blunders of the Spanish writers, who wrote long\nwords instead of short ones; blending articles and affixes. The Haytian\nthus analyzed and reduced is a very simple language, approximating to the\nprimitive and oriental forms, wherein short monosyllables of generic\nimport, formed the base of the speech, and became modified by union and\nrelative position.\n\nBy these means the following essential roots of the language have been\ncollected, and are given to help future similar investigations of American\nlanguages.\n\nExamples of composition.\n\n_Cazabi_ Bread. _Ca-za-bi_ soil-fruitful-life.\n_Manati_ Sea cow. _Ma-na-ti_ great-thing-eminent.\n_Turei_ Heaven. _T\u00e2\u0080\u0099ur-ei_ Thou-light-be.\n_Furzidi_ Cloudy. _Fur-zi-di_ gloom-it-is-day.

They have not\nbeen made to support it; but to find the truth, and the probable ancestors\nof this American nation, by seeking them all over the earth. If this\nnation one of the nearest to the eastern hemisphere, is thus found of such\nremote antiquity, those further removed and inland may well be deemed\nequally old, or rather older still: which their own history shall\ndisclose.\n\nOut of the 234 words collected; many it will be perceived, are hardly\ncomparable; being names of peculiar animals and plants. About 200 offer\ncomparisons with our languages well known. It must be remarked that the\nSpaniards borrowed many Haytian words, which have since been introduced\ninto Spanish and other European languages. Humboldt has given a list of\nthem. Those admitted in the English language now are, hurricane, canoe,\nkeys or islands, tobacco, pimento, yam, tomato, cassava, savana, mahogany,\npatatas, mangrove, indigo, copal, maize, bananas, parrot, guano, coco,\ncacao, guava, hammock or hanging bed &c.; which must not be compared,\nsince they have been borrowed by us from the Haytian. The Spaniards have\nbesides, chichas, balza, Cazic spelt cacique, aguti, manati, maguey,\ntiburo, guayac, macana, bejuco, nigua, tuna, aji, zeyba, &c.\n\nYet several of those words may be usefully compared in ancient languages\noften extinct, previous to the late connection with America. Thus we find\nanalogies for maize, canoe, cazic, cayman, yam, chicha, macana, manati\n&c., in many: indicating very ancient connections.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Even the words manati,\nhurricane, canoe, nigua &c., have affinities in modern Italic languages,\nnot derived from Hayti.\n\n_Comparative_ TAINO _Vocabulary of Hayti._\n\n_Authorities_,\u00e2\u0080\u0094R.

This great nation was\nstill further extended; since the Patagons or _Tinguis_, the Chiquitos or\n_Taos_, and perhaps the _Charruas_ belonged to it, as I shall show\nelsewhere.

Although it was a mere rude sketch, it contains many\n      important historical facts. I was too little advanced then in\n      philological studies, to give it their support, and many of my\n      surmises must be rectified by it. My late researches have also\n      greatly impaired the general belief of the Tartarian origin, and\n      western route of the Mexican nations.\n\n    2 I published this presumed key in 1832 in my Atlantic Journal; but\n      many accurate comparisons are yet required to confirm my surmises,\n      although the Lybian analogies are evident.\n\n    3 In Hughes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Travels in Sicily, Greece and Albania in 1813-14,\n      published 1820, we find this fact about Hesiod\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mention of maize,\n      used by the poor in mush and cakes by the early Greeks: the modern\n      Greeks call it _Arabo-sit\u00c3\u00a9_, Arabic corn, in Italy it is called\n      _Grano-turco_, or Turkish-corn: having reached Greece and Italy\n      through the Arabs, and not from America. It has been cultivated in\n      Java, Central Africa, Soudan, &c. from time immemorial, having\n      native names in the Negro languages. Gebelin thinks it was known in\n      Assyria. Polo found it in Tartary in the 13th century. Frazer lately\n      saw it almost wild in the Imalaya mts.: it has never been found\n      quite wild in America.\n\n    4 The _Poncho_ is a long strip of cloth, with a hole in the middle for\n      the head, the ends hanging before and behind, often fastened on the\n      sides. It was used by the ancient Mexicans, the Muyzcas, Peruvians\n      and Chilians. It has been adopted as quite convenient by the Spanish\n      colonists, and is very becoming when ornamented.\n\n    5 E-AD\u00e2\u0080\u0099M, Self-Adam, is the name given by Moses to the first men,\n      pronounced since Adam. Gen. 1. v. 27; but called also ZXR and N\u00e2\u0080\u0099K\u00e2\u0080\u0099BE\n      or male and female. The 2d AD\u00e2\u0080\u0099M or Adam was subsequent: although the\n      commentators have blended them, as they have the floods, days and\n      other things. Our bible translation of early events is besides very\n      erroneous; the Talmudist or Jewish version with points is not\n      correct, being in a late dialect: the true text of Moses which I\n      follow, has no points, but admits of a sheva or soft breathing\n      between consonants.\n\n    6 Geological comments are not here required, my business is with\n      mankind. Moses calls men beside _Aish_, _Anush_, _G\u00e2\u0080\u0099bforeign_, and\n      women _N\u00e2\u0080\u0099shim_, _Itath_, _Ashe_, _Ashth_; which are perhaps as many\n      names of early tribes! as well as ALEIM or _Elohim_, XRBIM\n      _Cherubim_, _Nahash_, &c. If these primitive names will offer any\n      analogies in America, they shall be thoroughly pointed out\n      hereafter. HUE is the real Eve. See the chapter on the Mosaic\n      Ontology for many other human beings, or early tribes. But it may be\n      well to add here the names of the beings of the 7th and 8th Yums\n      which we all deem animals, although there are indications to the\n      contrary.\n\n      7. YUM.

It is in this land of _Lanca_\n      that many traditions place Adam, with several early events.\n\n      The _Sunda_ land was very different, a large peninsula south of Asia\n      including Java, Sumatra, Borneo &c. Or perhaps an island, if Malaca\n      was separated from Siam by a strait.\n\n   10 The monumental archeology and history of America, is not the least\n      curious. Humboldt opened the way; but did little: the facts since\n      collected in Central and North America, will astonish all the\n      reflecting minds, and lead us to times of great civilization and\n      prosperity. In the single small state of Kentucky, have already been\n      found the sites of 200 ancient towns in ruins, or having monuments.\n      If as many exist in all the neighbourhood, there must have been 2000\n      towns in North America, west and south of the Apalachian mountains.\n      Many earthy remains are gradually disappearing under the plough, and\n      will be obliterated ere long.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_See_ my account of monumental sites,\n      published in 1824.\n\n   11 The Tao is one of the earliest religions of China. It is the\n      personification and worship of the powers of nature, the earth, air,\n      winds, thunder, sea, mountains, lakes, trees &c. The spiritual\n      worship of their souls is the purest part of it, while the blind\n      material worship of the objects themselves is the degradation of it,\n      as in Egypt and Guinea.\n\n   12 See my Memoir on the Domestic Annnals of Both Hemispheres, 1832,\n      Atlantic Journal, where the names of all are given. But I have\n      collected a few more since.\n\n   13 By admixture with American women, the Spaniards formed a mixed race\n      in Hayti, Mexico, Peru, Paraguay &c.; called Cholas, Mestizos &c.;\n      which partook of the qualities and vices of both races; few great\n      men have been produced by them; although we know of some exceptions.\n      Lavega one of the best American historians was son of a Peruvian\n      princess by a Spaniard. In Paraguay the Spaniards having no women,\n      took Guarani concubines, and all their offsprings were of mixt\n      breed, a sad set, like the Mamalucos of Brazil born from Portuguese\n      and Tupi women. These instances, and the production of mulatoes\n      subsequently, teach us how some former nations were born in America.\n\n   14 The Missouri tribes, Panis and Cumanches, the Abipons and Talahets\n      of the vast plains of N. and S. America; are already become\n      wandering horsemen like Tartars, quite formidable in war. Many\n      tribes now possess and use guns. Brandy, rum and whiskey, liquors of\n      hell, ... make the savage foes furious and reckless: they have\n      killed as many as guns have. The small pox is another scourge sent\n      to America from Europe, the Cholera may be another. The Syphilis\n      wrongly ascribed to America, has been traced to the ancient\n      continent also: although it was returned from hence again, like\n      maize.\n\n   15 The precious commodities of America are numberless. If the Europeans\n      had traded there for them, as they now do in China, Persia, Arabia\n      and Africa, how different would have been the fate of America? Iron\n      would have purchased gold and pearls, with every thing else: there\n      was no need to use the steel swords, nor thundering guns. Coffee and\n      rice are not American productions, but lately introduced from Arabia\n      and India. The origin of the sugar cane is also oriental; but it was\n      found wild in South America, as orange trees were in Florida.\n\n   16 The physical changes undergone in America within late historical\n      recollections are very numerous, and ought to be collected into one\n      connected body by historians or geologists.\n\n   17 These two figures of speech, _Personification_ and _Animalization_,\n      are two of the keys of ancient history. By the first is not meant\n      alone the personification of the passions or divine attributes; but\n      likewise the individuality of men, tribes and nations pervading\n      primitive history, by the frequent substitution of the singular for\n      the plural, as was done by the Asiatics, the Greeks, and the\n      Americans. It is thus that the ancient patriarchs, Hercules, Heros,\n      Gods &c. are often meant for their followers; the head for the whole\n      set or social body. This practice has survived to our days, and we\n      mean all the English when we speak of _John Bull_, the Russians by\n      the _Northern Bear_ (a kind of animalization), all the Turks by _the\n      Grand Turk_ &c. The reverse mode of speech or the employment of the\n      plural for the singular, is less frequent: but used when we\n      substitute in our modern languages, _We_ and _You_ instead of I or\n      Thee. It was less common anciently, yet it appears Moses employed it\n      when he called God, ALEIM our _Elohim_ or _the Angels_, and\n      polytheism was the consequence of similar mistakes or substitutions;\n      but in his account of the patriarchs, he has used the individuality\n      of tribes.\n\n      _Animalization_ pervades the whole of the fabulous periods of\n      history. It is to this mode of speech that we owe the fables of\n      Pilpay and Esopus, where animals are made to speak. Whenever we meet\n      in history or fables, animals acting like men and conversing, they\n      are surely men, and often tribes individualized by an animal\n      appellation: such as might be emblematic or patronymic, adopted\n      honorable names, as lion, tyger, eagle; or else nicknames given in\n      derision by foes, such as snake, dog, ape &c. Even the Hebrew had\n      their _Cherubim_, who were beings like a man, a lion, ox, and eagle;\n      who drove the Adamites from Eden. This name is preserved by the\n      Turks in _Cherabi_ or _Chelabi_, which means _Lords_ in the old\n      Turkish language of Turan or Tartary. Perhaps also in the _El-abi_,\n      now Arabians, which meant _Angel-fathers_, or our forefathers the\n      angelic men. _Elapi_ means _the most manly_ in Linapi!\n\n   18 The word _Olum_ is remarkable, because it is analogous to the OLEN,\n      the legislator and teacher of Runes of the Celts. The writings of\n      the Druids and Irish were called OCOL, CALLAN, OGHAM, the Irish OLAM\n      were recorders and teachers. _Olum_ does not properly mean a\n      writing, since _Leki_ is book, paper or letter in Linapi; but it\n      implies _a record_, _a notched stick_, an engraved piece of wood or\n      bark. It comes from _Ol_ hollow or graved record. Hekewelder says\n      that _Oluma-pisid_ was in the 18th century, a king of the Linapis on\n      the river Susquehanna, who kept the _Olum_ or records of the nation.\n      It is probable these were part of them.\n\n   19 These actual _Olum_ were at first obtained in 1820, as a reward for\n      a medical cure, deemed a curiosity; and were unexplicable. In 1822\n      were obtained from another individual the songs annexed thereto in\n      the original language; but no one could be found by me able to\n      translate them. I had therefore to learn the language since, by the\n      help of Zeisberger, Hekewelder and a manuscript dictionary, on\n      purpose to translate them, which I only accomplished in 1833. The\n      contents were totally unknown to me in 1824, when I published my\n      Annals of Kentucky; which were based on the traditions of\n      Hekewelder, and those collected by me on the Shawanis, Miamis,\n      Ottawas, &c.\n\n   20 This account of the creation is strikingly similar to the mosaic and\n      oriental accounts; although it does not speak of days or _Yums_. The\n      word for angels _Angelatawiwak_, is not borrowed, but real Linapi,\n      put in the plural: thus the same as the Greek _Angelos_.\n\n_   21 Jin-wis_ is the AISH or _Adam_ of all the Linapi tribes. W\u00e2\u0080\u0099IS is\n      identic with ISH, W\u00e2\u0080\u0099 being the article _he_, WI added to words is\n      common, meaning but _he_, _she_ and _they_, the plural _wak_ means\n      _many_.\n\n_   22 Owini_ may be analyzed O-WI-NI, meaning _such-they-men_ or beings.\n      O is the common article for pronouns _On_ and _Ce_ of the French, in\n      English _such_, _it_, _this_, _these_, preserved in many Linapi\n      dialects, _Ni_ and _Ini_ mean both _me_, _I_, _my_ and _men_. It\n      must be noticed that many words of these two ancient songs are often\n      obsolete now in some modern dialects; but preserved in others. This\n      with the peculiar ancient style, and the many words suppressed in\n      the narrative, and the constant compound words, have rendered this\n      translation a difficult task.\n\n   23 Here the _Owini_ become _Ni-jini_, evidently the Jins of China and\n      Iran; Jains of India.\n\n_   24 Wakon_ is the god of all the Missouri tribes, and many Asiatic\n      nations. _Akon_ of Syria.\n\n_   25 Tula_ is the ancient seat of the Toltecas and Mexican nations in\n      Asia: the _Tulan_ or _Turan_ or Central Tartary. In Linapi the\n      meaning is _Turtle_ or _Tortoise_, names derived from _Thor_ turtle\n      in Hebrew. But all derive from strong and tall. _Tul-ap-in_ is the\n      real tortoise of Linapi meaning _strong-manly-thing_: the water soft\n      turtle is called _Unami_. The Chinese, Hindus &c. point also to a\n      turtle as the THBE refuge of the flood. _Nana_ appears Noah; his\n      title of Hare must allude to his long ears? All the Linapi tribes\n      have tales and songs on Nana-bush, which they venerate as a god; but\n      his symbol is a turtle body with a large head and nose, and a crest\n      of feathers or hair on the head.\n\n   26 The symbol is a kind of Hercules, with a club and arrow; his name\n      appears to be Eluwi, thrice repeated and meaning _the most he_.\n      _Elu_ the root is probably akin to the _Aleim_ or _Elohim_ of Moses,\n      and _Elai_ meaning strong in Hebrew: also to _Her-cules_ of the\n      Latins, _Hera-cleen_ of the Greek, _Her_ prefixed meaning Lord.\n\n   27 Here the people begin to be called O-LINI, this was probably their\n      old name when coming to America. The tribes that used R for L must\n      have said _O-rini_, those who have neither, as the Niniwas and\n      Ottawas, say _O-nini_. This will afford matter for many philological\n      enquiries and comparisons.\n\n_   28 W\u00e2\u0080\u0099oken-api_ properly mean _the fathers manly_. _Shinaki_ the first\n      seat in America must have been near Alaska, and the big _Shinaki_,\n      the N. W. coast.\n\n   29 It is doubtful whether these 10 nameless kings were successive or\n      contemporary during the civil strifes. But the first is most\n      probable. If otherwise, this lessens the generations.\n\n   30 This southern land of _Akolaking_, and the subsequent _Minihaking_,\n      cannot be identified; but were west of Oregon mountains, probably\n      the Oregon country.\n\n   31 As early as 72 generations before 1600 or about 800 years before our\n      era, we find a recorder of old events, by means of _Olum_. Compare\n      _Olen_ and _Olam_ of Celts.\n\n   32 Here this people leave at last the Sea shores, and strike to the\n      east over the mountains. In _Oligon_, we have the etymology of\n      Oregon.\n\n_   33 Wisawana_ is either the Missouri or Yellowstone.\n\n   34 This _Tamenend_ is famous in the songs of the Linapis, and many\n      kings took that title afterwards. He is also the _Amik-wi_ or great\n      beaver of the Miamis and Ottawas.\n\n   35 Wingenund must have been another legislator, and high-priest. His\n      festivals are called _Gentiko_, and known to many nations.\n\n_   36 Maskan-Sini_, must be the Sioux and Assinis, called stony or hard\n      people throughout North America. The subsequent foes _Akowini_\n      appear to be the _Kowetas_, the _Lowanuski_ are the Esquimaux,\n      _Lowakon_ are the Ozages and Missouri tribes. Thus this was a period\n      of invasions by many nations, which compelled the Linapis to go\n      further east.\n\n   37 The Nemasipi is the Mississippi, so says Hekewelder: where began the\n      wars with the _Talegas_, the northern Toltecas or Atlantes, towards\n      48 generations before 1600, near the beginning of our era, which\n      continued for 4 generations or over 130 years, till about 150 after\n      Christ. The allies Talamatans are the Hurons and Iroquois then\n      united, since called _Delamatan_ and _Lamatan_. The traditions of\n      Hekewelder and Cusick both agree here in fact and time. That of\n      Hekewelder is most ample, taken from other songs; but these supply\n      names omitted by both. I rather think the Nemosipi must have been\n      the Ozages or Illinois river, since the Mississippi is called\n      afterwards Masispek, and the monuments of the Talegas are found west\n      of it at St. Louis &c.\n\n      In my ancient history of Kentucky, having only for guide Hekewelder\n      and some other traditions, I placed the conquest of the Talegas\n      about 500 of our era; but these annals are more correct and remove\n      further this event. The computation of Cusick annals of Ongwis place\n      this great event still earlier, or between 300 and 100 years before\n      our era. I knew neither Cusick nor the Wallam-Olum in 1824.\n\n   38 Here we find another recorder of events who probably wrote the\n      former wars with the Talegas.\n\n   39 The Linapi tribes begin to disperse now, about 600 years of our era.\n\n   40 This prophet, pontiff and king, went probably to visit many tribes,\n      and became their legislator.\n\n   41 These new wars were again with the Missouri tribes, _Lowako_ is a\n      new invading tribe from the north.\n\n   42 The passage of the Alleghanies was towards 800 of our era: the\n      atlantic states appear to have had no inhabitants, or but few.\n      Hekewelder confirms these facts.\n\n   43 Hekewelder has given no etymology of this river, the name means\n      either branching or roaring stream, perhaps both. _Winaki_ was the\n      name of east Pennsylvania.\n\n   44 By this account the Mohigans only separated towards 970 from the\n      main body. This may be inaccurate, as the north-east tribes appear\n      older by their traditions.\n\n      By the account given by the missionary Beatty in 1766, this event\n      would be still later: he states that after separating from the\n      western tribes and long wanderings, the Lenaps (Linapis) settled on\n      the river Delaware 370 years before 1766, or in 1396; which was\n      preserved in a mosaic belt.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_See Moulton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hist. of New-York, Vol\n      I._\n\n   45 This is the second Tamenend who united all the tribes 1010. This\n      famous name is spelt very variously _Tamanend_, _Tamany_, _Tamini_\n      &c. all meaning beavering or acting like a beaver. There are many\n      songs and traditions on them.\n\n   46 Here is the first mention of white men towards 1170 by the\n      computation of generations: whether they were Eric or Madoc, or\n      both, will be enquired hereafter. The Tuscororas of North Carolina\n      were visited at the same time by Cusick tradition, the Mohigans had\n      also their _Wach-queow_. Hekewelder has omitted this tradition like\n      many others. But Holm in his description of New Sweden positively\n      gives two traditions of the Linapis, tribe Renapis, of a _white\n      woman_ who came to America, married an American, had a son, who went\n      to heaven; and of 2 bigmouths (or preachers) who came afterwards\n      with long beards, and also went to heaven. This relates to the\n      bishop Eric who went to convert the Americans between 1120 and 1160,\n      rather than Madoc or a warlike band.\n\n   47 The Miamis or M\u00e2\u0080\u0099amiwis were descendants of the first beaver tribe,\n      separated long before.\n\n   48 This verse is double, or has 2 symbols with 6 words, appearing to be\n      two different readings united, or two modes of expressing the same\n      thing, the separation of the real Linapis into three tribes.\n\n   49 This may allude to the subjection of the Linapis, by the _Mahongwis_\n      (Mengwi or Iroquois) about this time, caused by the division of the\n      tribes. The name of failer is certainly an epithet or nickname\n      given: most of the names of kings appear of the same kind or titles.\n      We know they changed names when becoming kings or after great deeds.\n\n_   50 Otali_ is the real name of the Cheroki mountaineers, so says Adair:\n      this recalls the Talegas to mind, of whom they may be a fragment.\n      The _Wasioto_ are the Cumberland mountains, meaning the _South\n      Sioto_. The _Siotos_ were a Missouri tribe that advanced as far as\n      the _Sioto_ river in Ohio, gave name to it, and were expelled by the\n      Ottawas; probably akin to the _Otos_ of Missouri. They bear the\n      snake sign in the symbol.\n\n   51 The symbolic glyph for this event is nearly the same as for the\n      arrival of _Wapsi_ or Eric. A sea, a boat, with mast, sail, and\n      cross over it. Every nation is denoted by a peculiar sign on the\n      head in these annals. 1. _Jinwis_ and his wife by an aureole, 2. the\n      _Ako_ or snakes by a forked tongue or 2 horns, 3. the _Jins_ by a\n      crown of rays, 4. the _Owinis_ by a feather, 5. the kings by 3\n      feathers, the medial longer, 6. the Esquimaux by a T, 7. the\n      Talamatans by the same reversed T, 8. the Talegas by a bar pointing\n      to the right, 9. the Nentegos by a hook, 10. the Europeans by a\n      cross. This evinces a kind of systematic symbolic plan, like the\n      Mexican; but the symbols are very seldom similar.\n\n_   52 Mattanikum_ appears to be both the _Tinikum_ and _Mattahorn_ of the\n      Swedes and Holm. Horn is not a Linapi word, but Swedish, so as to\n      translate half the name. He was king in 1645.\n\n   53 Holm says the Renapis called the Swedes, Akhoures, which in dialect\n      Linapi would be _Akoli_, meaning _ugly_ or _snake-looking_; the\n      prefix _Win_, means either _the beings_ or snow, or may refer to\n      Winaki.\n\n   54 The assertion that no land was ever sold to the colonists is\n      singular. They thought to buy land with trifling presents; but the\n      natives understood all the while the permission to dwell with them.\n\n   55 This is a third Tamanend, the great king of the whole nation\n      dwelling at the forks of the Delaware, which appears in Penn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n      treaties, and came in great pomp in 1697. The other chiefs mentioned\n      in deeds, were only his vassals: he is also called Taminy; but is\n      very different from _Tatami_ who was king till 1748 at Welakamika or\n      Nazareth, where he was killed by an Irish settler. Hekewelder\n      mentions him; but has many blunders on Tamanend, having mixt the\n      three into one.\n\n   56 Netawatwis was king in the west from 1748 till 1776. Alimi or\n      Coquetha-gekton (Heck.) was regent of his grandson _Unamiwi_ till\n      1780, after him Gelelelund was regent till 1782 when the boy\n      _Unamiwi_ was killed by the Bigknives.\u00e2\u0080\u0094(Heck.) this was the cause of\n      the wars till 1795.\n\n   57 General Wayne was compared to their old foes, and called Black\n      Snake, because he beat the allied nations.\n\n   58 These are the chiefs of the two united tribes, that appear in the\n      last treaty with the United States.\n\n   59 The United States here are called snakes like the oldest foes of\n      mankind. The insiduous manner in which the English settled North\n      America, and wronged the natives, has procured them that\n      appellation. The French and Canadians are never called snakes. The\n      former names of _Yankwis_ has only been preserved as our Yankees.\n      The belief of their being _Gishakis_ or children of the sun-land, at\n      the sun-rise, has long been exploded here as in South America. The\n      Spanish cruelties did since procure to the Castillians the names of\n      devils, assassins, snakes of the sea &c.\n\n   60 Many other notions on the primitive nations, may be collected from\n      the mythologies of the various Linapi tribes. Their true devils are\n      similar to vampyres.\n\n   61 Wakon is the god and ancestor of all the Washashas or Ozage tribes,\n      Arkanzas, Sioux &c. belonging to the _Capaha_ or Missouri group of\n      nations.\n\n   62 The account of these strangers in Hayti is very slender and\n      confused, some writers deem them the ancestors of all the Caribs;\n      yet they acknowledge Caonabo as a late comer. _Mayo-banex_ name of\n      their last king means Maya-head in the Maya language. They must have\n      been an ancient colony or remain of the Mayas, since they had\n      already three dialects. All strangers were called Caribs at last by\n      the Haytians, whence the blunder.\n\n   63 Traces of 44 distinct nations or tribes are found in the ancient\n      history of the Antilles, (see last note) which are the ancestors of\n      all the American nations of eastern origin by the Atlantic ocean.\n\n   64 These titles of the Supreme God might furnish many pages of compared\n      analogies. _Mamona_ is identic with the _Mammon_ of Africa and Asia.\n      _Liella_ has analogies with all the EL or suns, gods and lords of\n      the east. _Atabeira_ is identic with _Atabyrius_ the Jove of the\n      Phrygians and Pelasgians: The meaning _Unic-being_ has analogies in\n      _Ata-beira_ all over the world. _Ata_ is one or first in many\n      languages. Compare _Atmon_ of Egypt, _Baracata_ or _Paraxacta_ the\n      nature or mother of _Brama_ of the Hindus. _Mamona_ with _Vimana_\n      eternal god of the Jains, the _Manitos_ of North America. _At\u00c3\u00a9_ was\n      god in Thracian, _Ata_ in Brazil, _Etua_ and _Heyta_ in Polynesia.\n      The names of God in the Cantabrian and Oscan dialects is _Ian_,\n      _Ion_, _Jauna_, _Jain_, _Janieva_, _Janugoieva_ &c. similar to\n      _Jemao_, _Jocana_ and _Hiauna_ of Hayti.\n\n_   65 Gua-ma-o-con_ was such-great-of-world, in the early monosyllabic\n      language of the Antilles. Compare with _Con-el_, and the gods of the\n      Atlantes, Guanches &c.\n\n   66 Compare the following words for winds with _Gua-banzex_.\n\n      _Vayajam_ Sanscrit.\n      _Band_ old Arabic.\n      _Watem_, _Vato_ Zend.\n      _Bangin_ Bali.\n      _Bentus_ old Latin.\n      _Ventus_ Latin.\n      _Andas_ Etruscan.\n      _Abka_ Abask.\n      _Sabam_ Ceylon.\n\n   67 It was _Jaia_, _Khaya_, _Cayo_, _Hay_ in the dialects and it is pure\n      Greek and Egyptian. Compare _Aya_, _Ai_, _Eia_, _Ia_, _Gaya_, in the\n      Pelasgic dialects, since become _Aya_, _Yaia_, _Gea_ in Greek.\n\n      _Kahi_ Egyptian.\n      _Akh\u00c3\u00a9_ Zend.\n      _Kay_ Deri of Iran.\n      _Iya_ Sanscrit.\n      _Ca_, _Aion_ Phenician.\n      _Ay_ Lybian.\n      _Aya_ old Irish.\n      _Ayate_, _Gays_ Ausonian and Oscan.\n\n      In America numerous analogies are found,\n\n      _Aya_ Betoy, _A_ in Lul\u00c3\u00a9, _Catun_ Tzuluki, _Acuti_ Moxos &c.\n\n   68 EL for son was primitive Haytian and synonymous with tribe,\n      children, family, divine or son of God as in Asia. In the dialects\n      _Rabu_, _Rahen_, _Muru &c._ meant Son. Compare _Ili_ tribe in\n      Persian, _Zitl_ man in Circassian, _Leh_ Osset, _Lez_ Lezghi. _Lele_\n      in Pelasgian, UL in Turan, now _Oglu_ in Turk\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Olgos_ Eolian,\n      _Vulgus_ Latin, _Chuli_ in Carthulan, _Oleos_, _Laos_ in Greek,\n      _Eleuth_ in Mongol, _Chula_ old Spanish, _Alu_ Copt, _Bail_\n      Etruscan, _Cobayl_ Berber, _Haial_ in D. _Shiluh_, _Ulu_ Afgan,\n      _Eli_ Hungarian, _Filius_ and _fam-ilia_ Latin &c. Even our words\n      _Fellow_, _Child_ and _Folks_ derive from this ancient source, the\n      oriental EL, IL, OL.\u00e2\u0080\u0094In America we find it in the OL-mecas, Chols\n      &c.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Olo_ in Vilela, _Yoale_ Abipon, ELES Mexican &c.\n\n   69 The _Cols_ are perhaps the Chols, Olmecas, _Colas_ of Florida,\n      _Collas_ of Peru &c. The _Caras_ may be the ancient Caribs, or the\n      Guaranis, the _Caras_ of Peru, the _Coras_ of Mexico &c.; compare\n      with the ancient Carians and many other primitive nations.\n\n   70 Although we do not meet in Hayti the Greek name of Atlantis, we have\n      so many allusions to the devils _Taras_, and Amazons _Amayuna_, that\n      we can connect these traditions with the Greek accounts. The\n      ancestors of the Haytians if Pelagians were foes and vassals of the\n      Atlantes; but allies of the Amazons.\n\n   71 Compare _Cazic_ with the following names for king:\n\n      _Oriental Names._\n\n      _Ach_ Egypt and Etruscan.\n      _Vasil_ of Greeks.\n      _Kasek_ in Sitka.\n      _Cazi_ in Iran.\n      _Sheik_ in Arabic.\n      _Zic_ Iberians and Sicules.\n      _Acalic_, _Agazi_ Berber.\n      _Bazilik_ Pelagian.\n      _Cahin_ Lybian.\n      _Hazil_ Carian.\n      _Cay_ Zend.\n      _Iza_ Tigreh.\n      _Cazil_ Mindanao island.\n      _Cazis_ Socotora island.\n      _Izcan_ of Haikans.\n      _Izca_, _Kan_ of Turans.\n      _Casis_ of Syrians.\n\n      _American Names._\n\n      _Acachi_ of Totonacas.\n      _Wachil_ of Nachez.\n      _Zac_ of Muyzcas.\n      _Cathi_ of Pinindas.\n      _Ahatic_ of Huaztecas.\n      _Inca_ of Peruvians.\n      _Chiaca_ of Coras.\n      _Cuchi_ of Puncays.\n      _Kiuska_ of Tzulukis.\n\n   72 Compare _Ziba_ with the following names for stone:\n\n      _Hiban_ in Berber.\n      _Uben_ in Hebrew.\n      _Aben_ in Syriac.\n      _Keibe_ Celtic.\n      _Siwa_ Nukahiva island.\n      _Ripa_, _Rupes_ in Latin.\n      _Sitaba_ Pelasgian.\n      _Bahiba_ old Arabic.\n      _Iba_ Samoyed.\n      _Batu_ Malay.\n\n      It is in America, _Siba_ in Cahiri, _Tabu_ in Yaoy; _Saba_, _Tebu_,\n      _Tobu_ in Galibi dialects, _Tushub_ in Huasteca, _Tepe_ in Mexican,\n      _Tzacapu_ in Talasca &c.\n\n   73 Although Matinino was one of the names of Martinico, it may have\n      been given afterwards, and there may have been another land of that\n      name, perhaps the Atlantis or Trinidad.\n\n      Garcia gives _Matalino_ as a synonym, _Ma_ means great, and thus it\n      would be the great TALINO, the real great _Atalantis_. The\n      conjecture is plausible; but the name was afterwards transferred to\n      South America. If the real African Atlantis is meant, the event must\n      be before the last flood.\n\n   74 This metal Guanin is the Orichalc of the ancient Greeks; which has\n      so much puzzled the learned, being wrongly deemed Platina, which\n      would have been infusible. It was the production of Atlantis!\n\n   75 But Garcia gives a different version of this fable, he says that the\n      men being in want of women sent 4 Caracols (their vassals?) to catch\n      wives, who were like ants on trees; but slippery like eels: yet some\n      being caught became the wives of the Guaninis. Ants were called\n      _Comekhon_ in Haytian, and thus we have another tribe akin to the\n      _Comaguas_, _Comayaguas &c._ who were previous settlers of Hayti,\n      and descendants of _Kon_! the _Khons_ of Lybia? But it is strange\n      that we find here the _Myrmidons_ of Grecian fable! and many\n      affinities in the name of that tribe of ants. _Mur-mekon_ in\n      Pelagian and Greek, _Umekon_ in Thracian, _Formica_ in Latin,\n      _Camot_ in Bali, _Mohur_ in Iran &c., while in America _Comagen_ of\n      Uraba, _Camaxen_ of the Talascas and Opatas. All referring perhaps\n      to the ancient people of Ants; the Pismires of Gothic tribes; a\n      people of dwarfs or weakness, akin to Pygmies and Troglodytes! thus\n      traced also to America.\n\n   76 Compare with _Anaboria_ or _Naboritas_ (working men) the following\n      names for vassals and laborers\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Naboriti_ in Coyba, _Labuyu_ of\n      Caribs, _Anaconas_ of Peru and Muyzcas, _Naboria_ of Mayas &c.\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\n      in the east.\n\n      _Tabara_ in Turan.\n      _Burutis_ in Ausonian.\n      _Aborian_, _Abeirgon_ Pelagic.\n      _Boor_, _Bura_ Frisic.\n      _Ambactos_ in Gaul.\n      _Manahunis_ in Tahiti.\n      _Nerba_ Hindostani.\n      _Bendar_ Pehlvi.\n      _Abondas_ Saxon.\n      _Canabas_, Knave Gothic.\n      _Nebara_ Nepal.\n      _Parias_ India.\n\n   77 It is remarkable that the primitive notions of the Haytians about\n      ghosts &c. prevail yet among the Negroes of the Antilles. The\n      _Obiah_ or sortilege, and _Dupin_ ghosts, of Jamaica &c., appear to\n      have survived. If introduced lately by the African Negroes, it is\n      strange they should be similar to the Haytian names of old.\n\n   78 The two brothers became gods of good and evil, as their names\n      indicate\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Gua-tauva_ implies _such goodness_: while _Pregonero_ is\n      the devil of Cumana, under the names of _Proruru_ or _Proguro_.\n\n   79 These priests drest in white as in Central America, and the Druids;\n      are primitive Lybian or Druidic priests and Pelagic Bramins. Their\n      name is found in\n\n      _Hubantes_ in Pelagic.\n      _Faybo_ of the Guanches.\n      _Vates_ Ausonian and Gaul.\n      _Aobu_ in Aramic.\n      _Behotus_ Dorian.\n      _Bedo_ old French.\n      _Phonto_ in Egypt.\n      _Purohito_ in Sanscrit.\n      _Budan_ in Pelvi.\n      _Budha_ of Budhists.\n      _Baharas_ Nepal.\n      _Heotes_ Sicanian &c.\n\n   80 The Caribs went nearly naked; when the Spaniards came with clothes\n      and guns the prophecy was explained. _Cochio_ for dress and mantle\n      has affinities with many ancient languages, _Gonachen_ in Iran,\n      _Ahico_ of Guanches, _Poncho_ of Peru and Chili, _Cachaca_ of Gauls,\n      _Cochaya_ of Slavonians, _Cota_ in Celtic &c.: whence our coat.\n\n   81 This is the most plausible account of Caonabo; but he perhaps was a\n      Maya and not a Carib: his name is not Carib, but Haytian, meaning\n      _gold of the house_. Anacaona would hardly have married a Carib? I\n      have attempted to put probable dates to these retrospective events,\n      loosely mentioned by Dangleria and the Spanish writers.\n\n   82 The intercourse between Cuba, Florida and the Lucayas was frequent.\n      Dangleria says the Lucayas were a happy people, with beautiful\n      women, for whose sake many Cubans and Floridans came to live there.\n\n   83 It will be proper to recapitulate here the ancient nations and\n      tribes of the Antilles, mentioned in these traditions and annals;\n      adding to each some well-known modern nations of the continent,\n      bearing nearly the same name, and most probably descended from them:\n      unless it is preferred to consider them as ancestors rather than\n      posterity, a very improbable fact. Meantime we acquire thereby a new\n      clue to American annals and ethnology: since nearly all the nations\n      of America may be connected with those by other links of languages,\n      traditions &c.\n\n      1. _Zemis_ or _Chemes_, Compare Zemis and Zemayos of Chaco and\n      Chimus of Peru.\n\n      2. _Tuyras_ or _Taras_, Compare Tarascas and Tarahumara of Mexico,\n      Taricas and Talas of Tucuman, Atures of Oronoc &c.\n\n      3. _Guabanz_, Compare Abays and Abipons of Chaco?\n\n      4. _Khayas_, Compare Cayubas and Khakhas of Peru.\n\n      5. _Higueras_ or _Hibueras_, Compare Guaranis, they called man\n      _Ibi_, the Borias &c.\n\n      6. _Boinis_, Bohanes of Charcas, and names of priests in South\n      America.\n\n      7. _Marohus_ or _Marocas_, Muras of Brazil, Aymaras of Peru,\n      Maronios of Charcas.\n\n      8. _Corocores_, Coretus of Brazil, Coras of Peru, Coros of Cumana,\n      Coras of Mexico.\n\n      9. _Coles_, probably same as Cores, Colas of Florida, Collas of\n      Peru, Chols of Central America, Cholas of South America.\n\n      10. _Caracara_ again same, Caras, Caris, Carios of Guaranis and\n      Peru, perhaps also Caribs?\n\n      11. _Manicos_ or _Manacos_, the great Nacos\u00e2\u0080\u0094Manicas or Manoas,\n      Maynas of Peru, Nacos of Comayagua.\n\n      12. _Icotas_ or _Hicoteas_, Cotos Carib tribes.\n\n      13. _Cautas_ appear same as _I-cota_\u00e2\u0080\u0094_I_ and _Hi_ are articles,\n      Cotos and Cotas tribes of Cumana and Oronoc.\n\n      14. _Caanau_ or _Caonas_, Cagnas, Canaris of Peru.\n\n      15. _Giagau_ or _Xaguas_, Changas of Peru, Achaguas of Guyana.\n\n      16. _Amayunas_, Mayoriexes of Hayti, Mayas of Yucatan, Mbayas of\n      Chaco.\n\n      17. _Machocha_, Machicuis of Charcas, Chunchos of Peru.\n\n      18. _Zibas_, Zipas of Muyzcas, Shibaois of Guyana.\n\n      19. _Khoboses_, Coropos of Brazil, Coybas of Darien, Mocobis of\n      Chaco.\n\n      20. _Gionas_ or _Aunas_, Yana-conas of Peru.\n\n      21. _Kadrus_, Aruacs of Guyana.\n\n      22. _Giahubas_, Yaoys, Shiahubas and Yahus of Guyana.\n\n      23. _Guaninis_, Guanas all over South America.\n\n      24. _Tonas_, Atun-collas of Peru, Tuncas of Popayan, Tun of Chili.\n\n      25. _Anacac_ or _Manati_, Tamanacus of Guyana.\n\n      26. _Boras_, Anaborias of S.

Meantime we find nowhere in these annals that\n      name of Antilia, which in their language would have been _Anti-ili_\n      sons of Antes, or _Ana-ti-ili_ flower-high-children. It may be a\n      Lybian name like Atlantes, both referring to the _Antis_ or Anteus,\n      the early inhabitants of North Africa, and of Peru.\n\n\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE AMERICAN NATIONS, VOL.

Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are\nparticularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.\nCompliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable\neffort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these\nrequirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not\nreceived written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or\ndetermine the status of compliance for any particular state visit\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have\nnot met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against\naccepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us\nwith offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the\nUnited States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods\nand addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including\nchecks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please\nvisit: http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.\n\n\n      General Information About Project Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 electronic works.\n\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with\nanyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2\neBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 eBooks are often created from several printed editions,\nall of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright\nnotice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance\nwith any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eBook\nnumber, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed\n(zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the\nold filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.\n_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n\n    http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2, including how\nto make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,\nhow to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email\nnewsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***FINIS***\n\f","id":1095,"split":"train"}
