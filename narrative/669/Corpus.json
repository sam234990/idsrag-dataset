BALLANTYNE.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE.\n\nDETHRONED BY FIRE AND WATER--A TALE OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE.\n\nTHE OPEN BOAT.\n\nEarly one morning, in the year 18 hundred and something, the great\nSouthern Ocean was in one of its calmest moods, insomuch that the\ncloudlets in the blue vault above were reflected with almost perfect\nfidelity in the blue hemisphere below, and it was barely possible to\ndiscern the dividing-line between water and sky.\n\nThe only objects within the circle of the horizon that presented the\nappearance of solidity were an albatross sailing in the air, and a\nlittle boat floating on the sea.\n\nThe boat rested on its own reflected image, almost motionless, save when\na slight undulation of the water caused the lower edge of its reflection\nto break off in oily patches; but there was no dip of oars at its sides,\nno rowers on its thwarts, no guiding hand at the helm.\n\nEvidently the albatross regarded the boat with curiosity not unmixed\nwith suspicion, for it sailed in wide circles round it, with\noutstretched neck, head turned on one side, and an eye bent inquiringly\ndownward.  By slow degrees the circles diminished, until the giant bird\nfloated almost directly over the boat.  Then, apparently, it saw more\nthan enough to satisfy its curiosity, for, uttering a hoarse cry, it\nswooped aside, and, with a flap of its mighty wings, made off towards\nthe horizon, where it finally disappeared.\n\nThe flap and the cry seemed, however, to have put life into the little\nboat, for a human head rose slowly above the gunwale.  It was that of a\nyouth, of about twenty years of age, apparently in the last stage of\nexhaustion.  He looked round slowly, with a dazed expression, like one\nwho only half awakes from sleep.  Drawing his hand across his brow, and\ngazing wistfully on the calm sea, he rose on his knees with difficulty,\nand rested his arms on a thwart, while he turned his gaze with a look of\nintense anxiety on the countenance of a young girl who lay in the bottom\nof the boat close beside him, asleep or dead.\n\n\"It looks like death,\" murmured the youth, as he bent over the pale\nface, his expression betraying sudden alarm; \"and it must--it must come\nto this soon; yet I cannot bear the thought.  O God, spare her!\"\n\nIt seemed as if the prayer were answered at once, for a fluttering sigh\nescaped from the girl's bloodless lips, but she did not awake.\n\n\"Ah! sleep on, dear sister,\" said the youth, \"it is all the comfort that\nis left to you now.  Oh for food!  How often I have wasted it; thought\nlightly of it; grumbled because it was not quite to my taste!  What\nwould I not give for a little of it now--a very little!\"\n\nHe turned his head away from the sleeping girl, and a wolfish glare\nseemed to shoot from his eyes as they rested on something which lay in\nthe stern of the boat.\n\nThere were other human beings in that boat besides the youth and his\nsister--some still living, some dead, for they had been many days on\nshort allowance, and the last four days in a state of absolute\nstarvation--all, save Pauline Rigonda and her little brother Otto, whose\nfair curly head rested on his sister's arm.\n\nDuring the last two nights, when all was still, and the starving sailors\nwere slumbering, or attempting to slumber, Dominick Rigonda--the youth\nwhom we have just introduced to the reader--had placed a small quantity\nof broken biscuit in the hands of his sister and little brother, with a\nstern though whispered command to eat it secretly and in silence.\n\nObediently they ate, or rather devoured, their small portion, wondering\nwhere their brother had found it.  Perchance they might have relished it\nless if they had known that Dominick had saved it off his own too scant\nallowance, when he saw that the little store in the boat was drawing to\nan end--saved it in the hope of being able to prolong the lives of\nPauline and Otto.\n\nThis reserve, however, had been also exhausted, and it seemed as if the\nlast ray of hope had vanished from Dominick's breast, on the calm\nmorning on which our tale opens.\n\nAs we have said, the youth glared at something lying in the stern of the\nboat.  It was a tarpaulin, which covered a human form.  Dominick knew\nthat it was a dead body--that of the cabin-boy, who had died during the\nnight with his head resting on Dominick's arm.  The two men who lay\nsleeping in the bow knew nothing of his death, and they were so weak\nfrom exhaustion at the time the boy died that Dominick had thought it\nunnecessary to rouse them.  The poor boy's emaciated frame could lie\ntill morning, he thought, and then the sleepers would assist him to put\nit gently into the sea.\n\nBut when morning came, the pangs of hunger assailed the self-denying\nyouth with terrible power, and a horrible thought occurred to him.  He\nopened a large clasp-knife, and, creeping towards the body, removed the\ntarpaulin.  A faint smile rested on the dead lips--the same smile that\nhad moved them when Dominick promised to carry the boy's last loving\nmessage to his mother if he should survive.\n\nHe dropped the knife with a convulsive shudder, and turned his eyes on\nhis sleeping sister and brother.  Then he thought, as he picked up the\nknife again, how small an amount of food would suffice to keep these two\nalive for a few days longer, and surely a sail _must_ come in sight at\nlast; they had waited for it, expectingly, so long!\n\nSuddenly the youth flung the knife away from him with violence, and\nendeavoured with all his might to lift the body of the boy.  In the days\nof his strength he could have raised it with one hand.  Now he strove\nand energised for many minutes, before he succeeded in raising it to the\ngunwale.  At last, with a mighty effort, he thrust it overboard, and it\nfell into the sea with a heavy plunge.\n\nThe noise aroused the two men in the bow, who raised themselves feebly.\nIt was to them an all too familiar sound.  Day by day they had heard it,\nas one and another of their comrades had been committed to the deep.\nOne of the men managed to stand up, but as he swayed about and gazed at\nDominick inquiringly, he lost his balance, and, being too weak to\nrecover himself, fell over the side.  He reappeared for a moment with\noutstretched arms and hands clutching towards the boat.  Then he sank,\nto be seen no more.  The other man, who had been his intimate friend and\nmessmate, made a frantic effort to save him.  His failure to do so\nseemed to be more than the poor fellow could bear, for he sprang up with\nthe wild laugh and the sudden strength of a maniac, and leaped into the\nsea.\n\nDominick could do nothing to prevent this.  While staring at the little\npatch of foam where the two men had gone down, he was startled by the\nsound of his sister's voice.\n\n\"Are they _all_ gone, brother?\" she asked, in a low, horrified tone.\n\n\"All--all, sister.  Only you, and Otto, and I left.  How soundly the\npoor boy sleeps!\"\n\n\"I wish it might please God to let him die thus,\" said Pauline, with a\nweary sigh that told eloquently of hope deferred.\n\n\"Your wish may be granted,\" returned Dominick, \"for the dear boy seems\nto be sinking.  It can scarcely, I think, be natural sleep that\nprevented the shout of that poor fellow from arousing him.  But lie down\nagain, Pauline; sleep may do you a little good if you can obtain it, and\nI will watch.\"\n\n\"And pray,\" suggested the poor girl, as she lay down again, languidly.\n\n\"Yes, I will pray.  Surely a sail must appear soon!\"\n\nDominick Rigonda was strong in youthful hope even in that hour of sorest\ntrial, but he was not strong in faith.  He prayed, however, and found\nhis faith strengthened in the act, for he looked up immediately after\nwith a feeling amounting almost to certainty, that the long-expected and\nwished-for sail would greet his eyes.  But no sail was visible in all\nthe unbroken circle of his horizon.  Still the faith which had prompted\nthe eager gaze did not quite evaporate.  After the first shock of\ndisappointment at his prayer not being answered according to its tenor,\nhis assurance that God would yet send relief returned in some degree,\nand he was not altogether disappointed, though the answer came at last\nin a way that he did not expect.\n\nAfter sitting in a half-sleeping condition for some time, he aroused\nhimself, and crept with considerable difficulty to the bow to procure\nthe blanket which had covered the two men who had just perished.  A\ncorner of the blanket had caught on the end of one of the floor-planks.\nIn disengaging it Dominick chanced to raise the plank which was loose,\nand observed something like a bundle lying underneath.  Curiosity\nprompted him to examine it.  He found that it was wrapped in canvas, and\ncarefully tied with cord.  Opening it he discovered to his surprise and\nintense joy that it contained some ship's biscuit, a piece of boiled\npork, and a flask of water.\n\nOnly those who have been suddenly presented with food and drink, while\nstarving can appreciate the feelings that filled the heart of the poor\nyouth with laughter and thanksgiving; but his joy was not selfish, for\nthe prospect of immediate personal relief had but a secondary place in\nhis thoughts.\n\nHastening with the inestimable treasure to the place where his brother\nand sister lay, he carefully spread it out on a piece of sailcloth, and\ncut a few thin slices of the pork before arousing them.\n\n\"Awake, sister, and eat!\" he said at last, gently shaking Pauline by the\nshoulder.\n\n\"O Dominick!\" she exclaimed, raising herself, and gazing eagerly at the\nfood.  \"I was dreaming of this when you awoke me!\"\n\n\"That's odd, now,\" said little Otto, who had also been aroused, \"for I\nwas dreaming of eating!  And I am so hung--\"\n\nHe got no further, for, having clutched a handful of biscuit, he\nsuddenly stopped the way of utterance.\n\n\"How good of you, Dom!\" said Pauline, eating with as much relish, though\nnot with such voracity, as her little brother, \"Where did you get this?\"\n\n\"No matter; eat and be thankful,\" said Dominick curtly, for he was\nhimself eating with wolfish haste by that time.  He restrained himself,\nhowever, after a few minutes.\n\n\"Hold!  We must not indulge too freely.  It will hurt us after fasting\nso long.  Besides, this supply is very small, and must be made to last\nas long as possible.  No, my boy, you must eat no more at this time, but\nyou may drink a little.\"\n\nAbout a table-spoonful of water was measured out to each, and then the\nremainder of the food was carefully wrapped up and put away.\n\n\"Do you think that this supply was hidden by one of the poor fellows who\nleft us this morning?\" asked Pauline.\n\n\"I think so; and no doubt his motive was a good one.  You know he was\nvery fond of his messmate.  I should think he saved up his allowance to\nhelp him; but, whatever the motive, it has proved a blessing to us--\"\n\nHe ceased speaking, for both sister and little brother had drooped their\nweary heads, and were again in a heavy slumber.  Dominick himself felt\nintensely the desire to follow their example, but he resisted it,\nfeeling that it was his duty to watch for the long-expected sail that\nnever appeared.  At first his efforts were successful, but by degrees\nthe tendency to sleep became so overpowering that his struggles were\nunavailing.  Sense of duty and every other motive gave way before it;\nhis head finally dropped forward, and, with a heavy sigh of contentment,\nhe followed his brother and sister to the land of Nod.\n\nProfound, prolonged, and refreshing was that sweet slumber, after the\nfirst good meal these poor castaways had eaten for many days.  The\nweather fortunately continued bright and warm, so that they did not\nsuffer so much from exposure as on previous days, and the gentle rocking\nof the boat tended to deepen and prolong their repose.\n\nThus they floated peacefully during the greater part of that day--the\none solitary speck on the surface of the great ocean, for the albatross\nseemed to have finally forsaken them.\n\nTowards noon a light westerly breeze sprang up.  It was not sufficient\nto raise a sea or disturb the sleepers, but, in conjunction with ocean\ncurrents, it drifted them to the south-east at a considerable rate, so\nthat in the evening, without the aid of oar or sail, they were far from\nthe spot upon the sea where we introduced them to the reader.\n\nAt last Dominick awoke with a long-drawn sigh, and, raising his head,\nlooked over the side of the boat.  An exclamation of surprise and joy\nbroke from him, for there, like a speck, where something like a heavy\nbank of clouds rested on the horizon, was the long-expected sail.\n\nHis first impulse was to awaken the sleepers, but he checked himself.\nHe would look more carefully.  His eyes might be deceiving him, and the\ndisappointment, if he should be mistaken, would be overwhelming.  He\nwould spare them that.  Rising to his feet he shaded his eyes with one\nhand, and gazed long and earnestly.\n\nThe longer he looked, however, and the more he rubbed his eyes, the more\nconvinced was he that a vessel was really in sight.\n\n\"Pauline,\" he said at length, with suppressed emotion, as he gently\nshook her arm, \"see, God _has_ answered our prayers: a vessel is in\nsight!\"\n\nThe poor girl raised herself quickly, with an exclamation of\nthankfulness, and gazed intently in the direction pointed out.\n\n\"It is, surely it is a ship,\" she said, \"but--but--don't you think there\nis something curious about its appearance?\"\n\n\"I have indeed been puzzled during the last few minutes,\" replied\nDominick.  \"It seems as if there were something strange under her, and\nher position, too, is rather odd.--Ho!  Otto, rouse up, my boy, and look\nat the vessel coming to save us.  Your eyes are sharp!  Say, d'you see\nanything strange about her?\"\n\nThus appealed to, Otto, who felt greatly refreshed by his good meal and\nlong sleep, sat up and also gazed at the vessel in question.\n\n\"No, Dom,\" he said at length; \"I don't see much the matter with her,\nexcept that she leans over on one side a good deal, and there's\nsomething black under and around her.\"\n\n\"Can it be a squall that has struck her?\" said Pauline.  \"Squalls, you\nknow, make ships lie over very much at times, and cause the sea round\nthem to look very dark.\"\n\n\"It may be so,\" returned Dominick doubtfully.  \"But we shall soon see,\nfor a squall won't take very long to bring her down to us.\"\n\nThey watched the approaching vessel with intense eagerness, but did not\nagain speak for a considerable time.  Anxiety and doubt kept them\nsilent.  There was the danger that the vessel might fail to observe\nthem, and as their oars had been washed away they had no means of\nhoisting a flag of distress.  Then there was the unaccountable something\nabout the vessel's appearance, which puzzled and filled them with\nuncertainty.  At last they drew so near that Dominick became all too\nwell aware of what it was, and a sinking of the heart kept him still\nsilent for a time.\n\n\"Brother,\" said Pauline at last in a sad voice, as she turned her dark\neyes on Dominick, \"I fear it is only a wreck.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" he replied gloomily; \"a wreck on a barren shore, too.\nNot a scrap of vegetation on it, as far as I can see--a mere sandbank.\nCurrents are carrying us towards it, and have led us to fancy that the\nvessel was moving.\"\n\nHe spoke with bitterness, for the disappointment was very great, and\nphysical weakness had rendered him less able to bear it than he might\notherwise have been.\n\n\"Don't get grumpy, Dom,\" said Otto, with a slightly humorous look that\nwas peculiar to him--a look which had not lighted up his eyes for many\ndays past.\n\n\"I _won't_ get grumpy,\" returned Dominick with sudden energy, patting\nthe boy's head.  \"It is quite clear that a good feed and a long rest\nwere all you required to set up your plucky little spirit again.\"\n\n\"Dom,\" said Pauline, who had been looking intently at the wreck, \"is\nthere not something like a line of white close to the wreck?\"\n\n\"Ay, there is,\" replied Dominick, his countenance again becoming grave;\n\"it is a line of breakers, through which it will be very difficult to\nsteer our little boat.\"\n\n\"Steer, Dom,\" exclaimed Otto, with a look of surprise; \"how can you talk\nof steering at all, without oar or helm?\"\n\n\"I must make one of the floor-planks do for both,\" returned Dominick.\n\n\"I say,\" continued the boy, \"I'm horribly hungry.  Mayn't I have just a\nbite or two more?\"\n\n\"Stay, I'm thinking,\" replied the other.\n\n\"Think fast then, please, for the wolf inside of me is howling.\"\n\nThe result of Dominick's thinking was that he resolved to consume as\nmuch of their stock of provisions as possible in one meal, in order to\nsecure all the strength that was available by such means, and thus fit\nthem for the coming struggle with the surf.  \"For,\" said he, \"if we get\ncapsized far from the shore, we have no chance of reaching it by\nswimming in our present weak condition.  Our only plan is to get up all\nthe strength we can by means of food.  So here goes!\"\n\nHe untied the bundle as he spoke, and spread the contents on his knees.\nOtto--who was, indeed, a plucky little fellow, and either did not\nrealise or did not fear the danger that lay before him--commenced to eat\nwith almost jovial avidity.  Indeed, all three showed that they had\nbenefited greatly by what they had already eaten, and now, for the first\ntime during many days, consumed what they considered a full and\nsatisfactory meal, while they drifted slowly, but steadily, towards the\nland.\n\nAs they neared it, the heavy mass on the horizon, which they had taken\nfor a bank of clouds, became more distinct.  A light haze cleared away\nand showed it to be an island, to which the sandbank formed a barrier\nreef; but any interest that might have been aroused by this discovery\nwas absorbed by present anxiety, for the white and gleaming surf warned\nthem that a serious and critical moment in their lives was fast\napproaching.  Pauline was awed into silence, and even Otto's countenance\nbecame gradually solemnised.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO.\n\nWRECKED ON A REEF.\n\nThe coral reefs, which in various shapes and sizes stud the Southern\nseas, are sometimes rendered almost unapproachable by the immense waves\nwhich fall upon them.  Even in the calmest weather these huge breakers\nmay be seen falling with prolonged roar on the beach.  The lightest\nundulation on the sea, which might almost escape observation away from\nland, takes the form of a grand, quiet billow as it draws near to an\nislet or reef, and finally, coming majestically on, like a wall of\nrolling crystal, breaks the silence suddenly by its thunderous fall, and\ngives to the sands a temporary fringe of pure white foam.\n\nTo ride in on the crest of one such roller on a piece of board and leap\nupon the shore, is a feat peculiar to South Sea islanders, who are\ntrained to the water from earliest infancy.  To do the same thing in a\nsmall boat, without oars, without strength, without experience, almost\nwithout courage, is a feat that no South Sea islander would attempt, and\nthe necessity for performing which might cause the hair of any\nislander's head to stand on end.\n\nThat Dominick Rigonda's hair did not stand on end, as he sat there with\npale cheeks and compressed lips, was probably due to the fact that he\nhad thrust his straw hat tightly down on his brows.\n\nAs the boat drew nearer to the reef, both Pauline and Otto had risen, in\nthe strength of their hearty meal, and were now seated on the thwarts of\nthe boat.  Their brother had selected the thickest floor-plank, and cut\nit roughly into the form of an oar with a clasp-knife.  He now sat with\nit over the stern, sculling gently--very gently, however, for he\nreserved the little strength that remained to him for the critical\nmoment.\n\nThe undulations of the sea, which had rocked them hitherto so softly,\nhad by that time assumed a decided form and force, so that the boat rose\non the oily back of each billow that passed under it, and slid back into\na watery hollow, to be relifted by each successive wave.\n\n\"You look very anxious,\" said Pauline, clasping her hands on her knee,\nand gazing earnestly in her brother's face.\n\n\"I cannot help it,\" returned Dominick, curtly.\n\n\"Is our danger then so great?\"\n\nDominick only half admitted that it was.  He did not wish to alarm her,\nand tried to smile as he said that the struggle would be brief--it would\nsoon be over.\n\n\"But tell me, where lies the danger?\" persisted Pauline.  \"I do not\nquite see it.\"\n\n\"`Where ignorance is bliss,' dear, `'tis folly to be wise,'\" returned\nDominick, with an unsuccessful effort to look more at ease.\n\n\"Nay, brother, but I am not ignorant that danger exists--only ignorant\nas to the amount and nature of it.  Surely there cannot be much risk in\npushing our boat through that white foam that lines the shore with so\nsoft a fringe.\"\n\n\"I should think not,\" broke in the pert and inexperienced Otto; \"why,\nPina,\" (thus he abridged his sister's name), \"there's as much danger, I\nshould think, in pushing through a tub of soap-suds.\"\n\n\"Come, Dom,\" returned the girl, \"explain it to me; for if you don't\npoint out where the danger really lies, if you leave me in this state of\npartial ignorance, I shall be filled with alarm instead of bliss from\nthis moment till we reach the shore.\"\n\n\"Well, well, sister,\" said Dominick, when thus urged; \"if you must have\nit, I will explain.\"\n\nHe went on to show that when the boat came near the shore the waves\nwould grasp it, instead of letting it slip back; would carry it swiftly\nin on their crests, so that the great difficulty in such a case would be\nto keep the boat's head pointing to the land, and if he failed to do so,\nthey would infallibly be overturned and have to swim ashore.\n\n\"Well, that would be unpleasant, Dom,\" said the ignorant, as well as\ninnocent, Pauline, \"but it would not matter much, for we can all swim--\nthanks to you for insisting on teaching us long ago.\"\n\n\"We will try our best,\" said Dominick, who thereupon relapsed into\nsilence, wisely resolving to let his sister retain all the \"bliss\" of\n\"ignorance\" that was possible under the circumstances.\n\nIndeed, there was not much more time for conversation, for the power of\nthe waves was beginning to be felt by the little craft, and the clumsy\noar did not act with as much precision or force as was desirable, while\nDominick's weakness rendered the steering difficult.  Pauline now began\nto realise the danger somewhat more clearly from experience, and even\nOtto showed symptoms of surprise that amounted very nearly to alarm, as\nthe boat at one point made a sudden rush on a wave-top as if it meant to\ntry a race with it, and then as suddenly slipped back into the hollow\nbehind, as if it had been disheartened, feeling that there was no\nchance.\n\nAt last they reached the point of greatest danger.  The huge waves, as\nwe have said, commenced out at sea in long, gentle undulations.  Nearer\nthe shore they advanced in the shape of glassy walls, one after another,\nlike successive lines of indomitable infantry in time of war.  Further\nin, the tops of these waves began to gurgle and foam, and gather real,\ninstead of seeming, motion, as they rushed towards their fall.  It was\nhere that the boat showed symptoms of becoming unmanageable.\n\n\"Why, the water's beginning to boil!\" exclaimed Otto, in some anxiety.\n\n\"Hold on, boy, and keep quiet,\" said his brother.\n\nAs he spoke, the water gurgled up, so that it seemed as if about to pour\ninboard all round.  At the same time the boat made a rush shoreward as\nif suddenly endowed with life.  Dominick struggled manfully to keep the\nstern to the sea.  He succeeded, but in another moment the boat slipped\nback.  It had not been fairly caught, and the wave passed on to fall\nwith a roar like thunder a hundred yards or so ahead.\n\n\"The next will do it,\" said Dominick, with an anxious glance behind,\nwhere a crystal wall was coming grandly on--unnaturally high, it seemed\nto them, owing to their position in the hollow.\n\nNo need to tell Otto now to hold on!  No need to explain difficulty or\ndanger to Pauline!  As her brother stood at the oar, quivering as much\nfrom weakness as exertion, she understood it all.  But she was brave,\nand she could swim.  This latter fact lent her additional confidence.\nBest of all, she had faith in God, and her spirit was calmed, for,\nwhether life or death lay before her, she knew that her soul was \"safe.\"\n\nAs Dominick had prophesied, the next wave took them fairly in its grasp.\nFor a few moments the water hissed and gurgled round them.  The\nsteersman seemed to lose control for a second or two, but quickly\nrecovered.  Then there was a bound, as if the boat had been shot from a\ncatapult, and the billow fell.  A tremendous roar, tumultuous foam all\nround, increasing speed!  The land appeared to be rushing at them, when\nDominick's oar snapped suddenly, and he went overboard.  A shriek from\nPauline and a shout from Otto rose high above the din of raging water,\nas the boat broached-to and hurled its remaining occupants into the sea.\n\nEven in that trying moment Dominick did not lose presence of mind.  He\ncould swim and dive like a water-rat.  Pushing towards his brother and\nsister, who were heading bravely for the shore, he shouted, \"Dig your\nfingers and toes deep into the sand, and hold on for life, if--\" (he\ncorrected himself) \"_when_ you gain the beach.\"\n\nIt was well they were forewarned, and that they were constitutionally\nobedient.  A few minutes later, and they were all swept up high on the\nbeach in a wilderness of foam.  The return of that wilderness was like\nthe rushing of a millrace.  Sand, stones, sticks, and seaweed went back\nwith it in dire confusion.  Prone on their knees, with fingers and toes\nfixed, and heads down, the brothers and sister met the rush.  It was\nalmost too much for them.  A moment more, and strength as well as breath\nwould have failed; but the danger passed, and Dominick sprang to his\nfeet.\n\n\"Up, up! and run!\" he shouted, as he caught Pauline round the waist and\ndragged her on.  Otto needed no help.  They were barely in time.  The\nsucceeding wave roared after them as if maddened at having lost its\nprey, and the foaming water was up with them, and almost round their\nknees, ere its fury was quite spent.\n\n\"Safe!\" exclaimed Dominick.\n\n\"Thank God!\" murmured Pauline, as she sank exhausted on the sand.\n\nOtto, who had never seen his sister in such a state before, ran to her,\nand, kneeling down, anxiously seized one of her hands.\n\n\"Never fear, lad,\" said his brother in reassuring tones, \"she'll soon\ncome round.  Lend a hand to lift her.\"\n\nThey bore the fainting girl up the beach, and laid her on a grassy spot\nunder a bush.  And now Dominick was glad to find that he had been\nmistaken in supposing that the coral reef was a mere sandbank, destitute\nof vegetation.  Indeed, before landing, he had observed that there were\na few trees on the highest part of it.  He now perceived that there was\nquite a little grove of cocoa-nut palms, with a thicket of underwood\naround them, which, if not extensive, was at all events comparatively\ndense.  He pointed out the fact to Otto, who was chafing his sister's\nhands.\n\n\"Ay,\" responded Otto, \"and the island on the other side must be a\ngoodish big one, for I got a glimpse of it through the trees as we came\nrushing in on that monstrous wave.\"\n\nIn a short time Pauline recovered, and Dominick returned to the water's\nedge with Otto.\n\n\"Our first care must be,\" he said, \"to save our little boat if we can,\nfor it is the only means we have of escaping from this island.\"\n\n\"Escaping!\" repeated Otto, in surprise.  \"I don't want to escape from\nit, Dom.\"\n\n\"Indeed! why not?\"\n\n\"Why, because I've dreamed about being cast on a desolate island\nhundreds of times, and I've read about Robinson Crusoe, and all the\nother Crusoes, and I've longed to be cast on one, and now I am cast on\none, so I don't want to escape.  It'll be the greatest fun in the world.\nI only hope I won't wake up, as usual, to find that it's all a dream!\"\n\nDominick laughed (not scornfully, by any means) at the boy's enthusiasm;\nnevertheless he had strong sympathy with him, for the period had not\npassed so long ago when he himself entertained a very vivid impression\nof the romance of such a situation, and he did not trouble his mind\nabout the stern realities.\n\n\"I sincerely hope it may come up to your expectations, Otto, my boy;\nnevertheless we must secure the boat for fishing purposes, even though\nwe don't try to escape in it.\"\n\n\"For fishing! why, we have neither hooks nor lines.\"\n\n\"True, lad; but we have got fingers and brains.  It strikes me that we\nshall have occasion to use all our powers and possessions if we are not\nto starve here, for the reef seems to have very little vegetation on it,\nand there is sure to be a lagoon of water on the other side, separating\nit from the island beyond.\"\n\n\"I wonder if there is fresh water on the reef,\" said Otto, with a very\nsudden look of solemnity and pursing of the mouth.\n\n\"You may well ask that.  I hope there is.  We will go and settle the\npoint the moment we have secured the boat, if--\"\n\nHe stopped, for he saw at that moment that the sea had taken good care\nto secure the boat to itself as a plaything.  Having dashed it into\nsmall pieces, it was by that time busily engaged in tossing these about\namong the foam, now hurling the splinters high upon the shore, anon\nsending up long watery tongues to lick them back, and then casting them\nunder the incoming rollers, to be further reduced into what is usually\nstyled matchwood.\n\nThere was a small bay close at hand, where the sandy beach was strewn\nwith rocks, in which the sea appeared to play this game with unusual\nvigour.  It was a sort of hospital for marine incurables, into which the\nsea cast its broken toys when tired of smashing them up, and left them\nthere to rot.\n\nRegarding this spot with a thoughtful look, Dominick remarked that the\nwreck which lay on the rocks off the tail of the island was by no means\nthe first that had taken place there.\n\n\"And won't be the last, I fancy,\" said Otto.\n\n\"Probably not.  Indeed, from the appearance of this bay, and the fact\nthat an ocean current drifted us towards the spot, I should think that\nthe island is a particularly dangerous one for vessels.  But come, we'll\ngo see how Pina gets on, and then proceed to examine our new home.\"\n\nReturning to the place where Pauline had been left, they found the poor\ngirl wringing the water out of her dress.  The news of the fate of the\nlittle boat did not seem to affect her much, she did not fully\nappreciate the loss, and was more taken up with the idea of thankfulness\nfor deliverance from death.\n\n\"May I not go with you?\" she asked, on hearing that her brothers were\ngoing to search for water.\n\n\"Certainly.  I thought you might perhaps prefer to rest, and dry your\nclothes in the sun,\" replied Dominick.\n\n\"Walking will dry them better,\" said Pina.  \"Besides, I have quite\nrecovered.\"\n\n\"You're a plucky little woman,\" said Otto, as they set off.  \"Isn't it\nnice to be here all by ourselves, on a real uninhabited island, quite\nfit for Robinson himself?  Who knows but we may find Friday in the\nbushes!\"\n\n\"Wouldn't that spoil it as an uninhabited isle?\"\n\n\"A little, but not much.\"\n\n\"The thicket is too small to contain anything with life, I fear,\" said\nDominick, whose anxiety as to food and drink prevented his sympathising\nmuch with the small-talk of the other two.  \"Luckily the weather is\nwarm,\" he added, \"and we won't require better shelter at present than\nthe bushes afford, unless a storm comes.--Ho what have we here?--a\npath!\"\n\nThey had reached the entrance to the thicket, and discovered what\nappeared to be an opening into it, made apparently by the hand of man.\n\n\"Nothing more likely,\" said Pauline.  \"If so many wrecks have taken\nplace here--as you seem to think--some of the crews must have landed,\nand perhaps lived here.\"\n\n\"Ay, and died here,\" returned Dominick, in a grave, low tone, as he\npointed to a skeleton lying on a spot which had once been cleared of\nbushes, but so long ago that the vegetation had partially grown up\nagain.  The man whose bleached bones lay before them had evidently\nperished many years before.  On examination, nothing was found to afford\nany information about him, but when they had advanced a dozen yards\nfurther they came upon six little mounds, which showed that a party--\nprobably a wrecked crew--had sojourned there for a time, and finally\nperished: so far their story was clear enough.  One by one they must\nhave sunk, until the last man had lain down to die and remain unburied.\n\nPushing past these sad evidences of former suffering, and feeling that\nthe same fate might await themselves, they came to a sight which tended\nslightly to restore their spirits.  It was a pool of water of\nconsiderable size, whether a spring or a rain-pool they could not tell.\nNeither did they care at that time, for the sudden feeling of relieved\nanxiety was so great, that they ran forward, as if under one impulse,\nand, lying down on their breasts, took a long refreshing draught.  So\npowerful was the influence of this refreshment and discovery on their\nspirits that they became totally regardless and forgetful for the moment\nabout food--all the more that, having so recently had a good meal, they\nwere not hungry.\n\n\"I was sure we would find water,\" said Otto, as they continued to\nexplore the thicket, \"and I've no doubt that we shall find yams and\nplantains and breadfruits, and--aren't these the sort of things that\ngrow wild on coral islands, Dom?\"\n\n\"Yes, but I fear not on such a little scrap of reef as this.  However,\nwe shall not be quite destitute, for there are cocoa-nuts, you see--\nthough not many of them.  Come, our prospects are brightening, and as\nthe sun is beginning to sink, we will look out for a suitable\ncamping-ground.\"\n\n\"As far away from the skeleton, please, as possible,\" said Otto.\n\n\"Surely you don't suppose it can hurt you?\" said Pauline.\n\n\"N-no, of course not, but it would be unpleasant to have it for a\nbedfellow, you know; so, the further away from it the better.\"\n\nAs he spoke they emerged from the thicket, at the end opposite to the\nspot where they had entered, and had their spirits again powerfully\ncheered by coming suddenly into a blaze of sunshine, for the bright orb\nof day was descending at that side of the islet, and his red,\nresplendent rays were glowing on the reef and on the palm-trees.\n\nThey also came in full view of the islet beyond, which, they now\nperceived, was of considerable size, and covered with vegetation, but,\nas Dominick had suspected, separated completely from the reef or outer\nisle on which they stood by a deep lagoon.\n\n\"Splendid!\" exclaimed Pauline.\n\n\"As I feared,\" muttered Dominick, \"and no means of reaching it.\"\n\n\"Pooh!  Didn't Robinson Crusoe make rafts?\" said Otto; \"at least if he\ndidn't, somebody else did, and anyhow _we_ can.\"\n\n\"Come, let us continue our walk,\" said Dominick.  \"You don't fully\nappreciate the loss of our boat Otto.  Don't you see that, even if we do\nbuild a raft, it will at best be a clumsy thing to manage, and heavy to\npull, slow to sail, and bad to steer, and if we should chance to be on\nit when a stiff breeze springs up from the land, we should probably be\ndriven out to sea and lost--or separated, if Pina should chance to have\nbeen left on shore at the time.\"\n\n\"What a fellow you are, Dom, for supposing chances and difficulties, and\nfancying they cannot be overcome,\" returned Otto, with the pert\nself-sufficiency that characterised him.  \"For my part I rather enjoy\ndifficulties, because of the fun of overcoming them.  Don't you see, we\nthree can make quite sure of never being separated by never going out on\nour raft except together, so that we shall always enjoy ourselves\nunitedly, or perish in company.  Then we can easily get over the\ndifficulty of being blown out to sea, by never going on the sea at all,\nbut confining ourselves entirely to the lagoon, which is large enough\nfor any reasonable man, and may be larger than we think, for we can't\nsee the whole of it from where we stand.  Then, as to sailing and rowing\nslowly, we can overcome these difficulties by not being in a hurry,--\ntaking things easy, you know.\"\n\nTo this Dominick replied that there was one difficulty which his little\nbrother, with all his wisdom and capacity, would never overcome.\n\n\"And what may that be?\" demanded Otto.\n\n\"The difficulty of being unable to talk common-sense.\"\n\n\"True, Dom, true, that is a great difficulty,\" retorted the boy, with\ndeep humility of aspect, \"for a man's conversation is greatly affected\nby the company he keeps, and with _you_ as my only male companion, I\nhave not much to hope for in the way of example.  But even that may be\ngot the better of by holding intercourse chiefly with Pina.\"\n\n\"But what if I refuse to talk?\" said Pauline, with a laugh.\n\n\"Then will you be all the more able to listen, sister mine, which is the\nmost common-sense thing that you can do, except when brother Dom\nspeaks,\" said the incorrigible boy.\n\nThey had seated themselves on a bank while thus conversing, and from\ntheir position could see over a considerable portion of the lagoon.\nSuddenly Dominick pointed to an object a long way off, which was half\nconcealed by the shadow of an island.\n\n\"Does it not look like a canoe?\" he asked eagerly.\n\n\"Can't make it out at all,\" said Otto, shading his eyes with his hand.\n\n\"The sun on the water dazzles one so,\" observed Pauline, \"that it is\ndifficult to look steadily.\"\n\nIn a few moments the object which had drawn their attention sailed out\nfrom under the shade of the island, and, breaking up into fragments,\nrose into the air, proving itself to be a flock of large aquatic birds\nwhich had been swimming in a line.\n\n\"Things are not what they seem,\" observed Pauline, rising and following\nher brothers through a little thicket.\n\n\"What a pity!\" exclaimed Otto; \"I was in hopes it was a canoeful of\nsavages.  It would be such fun to have a real Friday to be our servant.\"\n\n\"More likely that our Friday would kill, cook, and eat us if he could,\"\nsaid Dominick, to the surprise of Otto, who gave it as his opinion that\nsavages never ate men, and asked if his brother really believed that\nthey did.\n\n\"Indeed I do.  We have it recorded by all the best authorities that\nSouth Sea islanders are given to this horrible practice.  There can be\nno doubt about it whatever, and the less we see of these fellows in our\npresent defenceless state the better.\"\n\n\"How little,\" said Pauline, \"our dear father thought when he wrote for\nus to go out to him in his ship, that we should be cast on an unknown\nisland, and the ship itself go to the bottom!\"\n\n\"Little indeed, and as little did poor mother dream of such a fate,\"\nreturned Dominick, \"when she let us all go so readily, on the\nunderstanding that we should give father no rest until we had got him to\ngive up business, quit Java for ever, and return home.\"\n\n\"Dear old mother!\" said Pauline, \"I wish--oh!  I wish so much that we\nhad not left her, even though it was to be for only a few months.  She\nmust be _so_ lonely, with no one to talk to--\"\n\n\"You forget Pina.\"\n\n\"Forget--what?\"\n\n\"The cat,\" returned Otto, unable to repress a smile, which rose in spite\nof the ready tear that dimmed his eye at the mere mention of his mother.\n\"You know the cat is her great resource--a sort of safety-valve.\nSometimes, when I've been listening to her, lying on the rug at her feet\nhalf asleep, I've heard her talk to that cat as if it really was a human\nbeing, and tell it all about her little affairs and daily troubles and\nworries in quite a confidential tone.  I've taken it into my head that\nthat's mother's way of thinking aloud--she thinks at the cat, for\ncompany: and to do the brute justice, it does its best to accommodate\nher.  I've seen it sit and stare at her by the half-hour at a time, and\ngive a little purr or a meaiow now and then as if it wanted to speak.\nI'm quite sure it thinks, and wonders no doubt what idle, useless work\nit is to click knitting-needles together by the hour.\"\n\n\"Dear me, Otto,\" said Pauline, with a laugh, \"I had no idea that you\ncould think so much about anything.\"\n\n\"Think!\" exclaimed the boy, indignantly; \"d'you suppose that it's only\nstern-browed, long-legged fellows like Dom there who can think?  Why, I\nthink, and think, sometimes, to such an extent that I nearly think\nmyself inside out!  But, Pina, you don't know half as much about\nmotherkin as I do, for when _you_ are with her she usually forgets\n_herself_, I can see, and talks only about the things that interest\n_you_; whereas, when there's nobody present but _me_, she counts me for\nnothing, and lets me do pretty much what I like--because no doubt she\nthinks I'll do that whether she lets me or not--but she's wrong, for I\nlove her far more than she thinks; and then it's when I'm quiet and she\nforgets me, I fancy, or thinks I'm asleep, that she comes out strong at\nthe cat.\"\n\n\"Darling mother!\" said Pauline, musingly.  \"I can see her now, in my\nmind, with her neat black cap and smooth braided hair, and gold\nspectacles, as plain as if she were sitting before me.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry to destroy the vision, Pina, on my own account as well as\nyours,\" observed Dominick, \"but it behoves us now to look for a night's\nlodging, for the sun is sinking fast, and it would not be pleasant to\nlie down on the bare ground shelterless, fine though the climate is.\nCome, we will return to the place where we landed, and search for a cave\nor a bit of overhanging rock.\"\n\nThe best sleeping-place that they had up to that time discovered was\nundoubtedly the grove in which they had found the graves of the\nshipwrecked crew, but, as Otto truly remarked, it would probably result\nin uncomfortable dreams if they were to go to sleep in a burying-ground,\nalongside of a skeleton.\n\nAccordingly they returned to the beach, and sought for some time among\nthe _debris_ of the boat for anything useful that might have been washed\nup, but found nothing.  Then they went along-shore in the direction of\nthe wreck which had raised their hopes so high that day when first seen,\nbut nothing suitable was discovered until they rounded a low point of\nrocks, when Pauline came to a sudden pause.\n\n\"Look! a golden cave!\" she exclaimed, pointing eagerly to a grassy spot\nwhich was canopied by feathery palms, and half enclosed by coral rocks,\nwhere was a cavern into which the sinking sun streamed at the moment\nwith wonderful intensity.\n\nTheir home for that night obviously lay before them, but when they\nentered it and sat down, their destitution became sadly apparent.  No\nbeds to spread, no food to prepare, nothing whatever to do but lie down\nand sleep.\n\n\"No matter, we're neither hungry nor thirsty,\" said Dominick, with an\nair of somewhat forced gaiety, \"and our clothes are getting dry.  Come,\nsister, you must be weary.  Lie down at the inner side of the cave, and\nOtto and I, like faithful knights, will guard the entrance.  I--I wish,\"\nhe added, in a graver tone, and with some hesitation, \"that we had a\nBible, that we might read a verse or two before lying down.\"\n\n\"I can help you in that,\" said his sister, eagerly.  \"I have a fair\nmemory, you know, and can repeat a good many verses.\"\n\nPauline repeated the twenty-third Psalm in a low, sweet voice.  When she\nhad finished, a sudden impulse induced Dominick, who had never prayed\naloud before, to utter a brief but fervent prayer and thanksgiving.\nThen the three lay down in the cave, and in five minutes were sound\nasleep.\n\nThus appropriately did these castaways begin their sojourn on a spot\nwhich was destined to be their home for a long time to come.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE.\n\nEXPLORATIONS AND DISCOVERIES.\n\nAs the sun had bathed the golden cave when our castaways went to sleep,\nso it flooded their simple dwelling when they awoke.\n\n\"Then,\" exclaims the intelligent reader, \"the sun must have risen in the\nwest!\"\n\nBy no means, good reader.  Whatever man in his wisdom, or weakness, may\ndo or say, the great luminaries of day and night hold on the even tenor\nof their way unchanged.  But youth is a wonderful compound of strength,\nhope, vitality, carelessness, and free-and-easy oblivion, and, in the\nunconscious exercise of the last capacity, Pauline and her brothers had\nslept as they lay down, without the slightest motion, all through that\nnight, all through the gorgeous sunrise of the following morning, all\nthrough the fervid noontide and the declining day, until the setting sun\nagain turned their resting-place into a cave of gold.\n\nThe effect upon their eyelids was such that they winked, and awoke with\na mighty yawn.  We speak advisedly.  There were not three separate\nawakenings and three distinct yawns; no, the rousing of one caused the\nrousing of the others in succession so rapidly that the yawns,\ncommencing with Pauline's treble, were prolonged, through Otto's tenor\ndown to Dominick's bass, in one stupendous monotone or slide, which the\nlast yawner terminated in a groan of contentment.  Nature, during the\npast few days, had been doubly defrauded, and she, having now partially\nrepaid herself, allowed her captives to go free with restored vigour.\nThere was, however, enough of the debt still unpaid to induce a desire\nin the captives to return of their own accord to the prison-house of\nOblivion, but the desire was frustrated by Otto, who, sitting up\nsuddenly and blinking at the sun with owlish gravity, exclaimed--\n\n\"Well, I never!  We've only slept five minutes!\"\n\n\"The sun hasn't set _yet_!\"\n\nDominick, replying with a powerful stretch and another yawn, also raised\nhimself on one elbow and gazed solemnly in front of him.  A gleam of\nintelligence suddenly crossed his countenance.\n\n\"Why, boy, when we went to sleep the sun was what you may call six feet\nabove the horizon; now it is twelve feet if it is an inch, so that if it\nbe still setting, it must be setting upwards--a phenomenon of which the\nrecords of astronomical research make no mention.\"\n\n\"But it _is_ setting?\" retorted Otto, with a puzzled look, \"for I never\nheard of your astronomical searchers saying that they'd ever seen the\nsun rise in the same place where it sets.\"\n\n\"True, Otto, and the conclusion I am forced to is that we have slept\nright on from sunset to sunset.\"\n\n\"So, then, we've lost a day,\" murmured Pauline, who in an attitude of\nhelpless repose, had been winking with a languid expression at the\nluminous subject of discussion.\n\n\"Good morning, Pina,\" said Dominick.\n\n\"Good evening, you mean,\" interrupted his brother.  \"Well, good evening.\nIt matters little which; how have you slept?\"\n\n\"Soundly--oh, so soundly that I don't want to move.\"\n\n\"Well, then, don't move; I'll rise and get you some breakfast.\"\n\n\"Supper,\" interposed Otto.\n\n\"Supper be it; it matters not.--But don't say we've lost a day, sister\nmine.  As regards time, indeed, we have; but in strength I feel that I\nhave gained a week or more.\"\n\n\"Does any one know,\" said Otto, gazing with a perplexed expression at\nthe sky--for he had lain back again with his hands under his head--\"does\nany one know what day it was when we landed?\"\n\n\"Thursday, I think,\" said Dominick.\n\n\"Oh no,\" exclaimed Pauline; \"surely it was Wednesday or Tuesday; but the\nanxiety and confusion during the wreck, and our terrible sufferings\nafterwards in the little boat, have quite confused my mind on that\npoint.\"\n\n\"Well, now, here's a pretty state of things,\" continued Otto, sleepily;\n\"we've lost one day, an' we don't agree about three others, and Dom says\nhe's gained a week! how are we ever to find out when Sunday comes, I\nshould like to know?  There's a puzzler--a reg'lar--puzzl'--puz--\"\n\nA soft snore told that \"tired Nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep,\" had\nagain taken the little fellow captive, and prolonged silence on the part\nof the other two proved them to have gone into similar captivity.\nNature had not recovered her debt in full.  She was in an exacting mood,\nand held them fast during the whole of another night.  Then she set them\nfinally free at sunrise on the following day, when the soft yellow light\nstreamed on surrounding land and sea, converting their sleeping-place\ninto a silver cave by contrast.\n\nThere was no languid or yawny awakening on this occasion.  Dominick sat\nup the instant his eyes opened, then sprang to his feet, and ran out of\nthe cave.  He was followed immediately by Otto and Pauline, the former\ndeclaring with emphasis that he felt himself to be a \"new man.\"\n\n\"Yes, Richard's himself again,\" said Dominick, as he stretched himself\nwith the energy of one who rejoices in his strength.  \"Now, Pina, we've\ngot a busy day before us.  We must find out what our islet contains in\nthe way of food first, for I am ravenously hungry, and then examine its\nother resources.  It is very beautiful.  One glance suffices to tell us\nthat.  And isn't it pleasant to think that it is all our own?\"\n\n\"`The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof,'\" said his sister,\nsoftly.\n\nThe youth's gaiety changed into a deeper and nobler feeling.  He looked\nearnestly at Pauline for a few seconds.\n\n\"Right, Pina, right,\" he said.  \"To tell you the truth, I was\nhalf-ashamed of my feelings that time when I broke into involuntary\nprayer and thanksgiving.  I'm ashamed now of having been ashamed.  Come,\nsister, you shall read the Word of God from memory, and I will pray\nevery morning and evening as long as we shall dwell here together.\"\n\nThat day they wandered about their islet with more of gaiety and\nlight-heartedness than they would have experienced had they neglected,\nfirst, to give honour to God, who not only gives us all things richly to\nenjoy, but also the very capacity for enjoyment.\n\nBut no joy of earth is unmingled.  The exploration did not result in\nunmitigated satisfaction, as we shall see.\n\nTheir first great object, of course, was breakfast.\n\n\"I can't ask you what you'll have, Pina.  Our only dish, at least this\nmorning,\" said Dominick, glancing upwards, \"is--\"\n\n\"Cocoa-nuts,\" put in Otto.\n\nOtto was rather fond of \"putting in\" his word, or, as Dominick expressed\nit, \"his oar.\"  He was somewhat pert by nature, and not at that time\ngreatly modified by art.\n\n\"Just so, lad,\" returned his brother; \"and as you have a considerable\nspice of the monkey in you, be good enough to climb up one of these\npalms, and send down a few nuts.\"\n\nTo do Otto justice, he was quite as obliging as he was pert; but when he\nstood at the foot of the tall palm-tree and looked up at its thick stem,\nhe hesitated.\n\n\"D'you know, Dom,\" he said, \"it seems to me rather easier to talk about\nthan to do?\"\n\n\"You are not the first who has found that out,\" returned his brother,\nwith a laugh.  \"Now, don't you know how the South Sea islanders get up\nthe palm-trees?\"\n\n\"No; never heard how.\"\n\n\"Why, I thought your great authority Robinson Crusoe had told you that.\"\n\n\"Don't think he ever referred to it.  Friday may have known how, but if\nhe did, he kept his knowledge to himself.\"\n\n\"I wish you two would discuss the literature of that subject some other\ntime,\" said Pauline.  \"I'm almost sinking for want of food.  Do be\nquick, please.\"\n\nThus urged, Dominick at once took off his neckcloth and showed his\nbrother how, by tying his feet together with it at a sufficient distance\napart, so as to permit of getting a foot on each side of the tree, the\nkerchief would catch on the rough bark, and so form a purchase by which\nhe could force himself up step by step, as it were, while grasping the\nstem with arms and knees.\n\nOtto was an apt scholar in most things, especially in those that\nrequired activity of body.  He soon climbed the tree, and plucked and\nthrew down half a dozen cocoa-nuts.  But when these had been procured,\nthere still remained a difficulty, for the tough outer husk of the nuts,\nnearly two inches thick, could not easily be cut through with a\nclasp-knife so as to reach that kernel, or nut, which is ordinarily\npresented to English eyes in fruit-shops.\n\n\"We have no axe, so must adopt the only remaining method,\" said\nDominick.\n\nLaying a nut on a flat rock, he seized a stone about twice the size of\nhis own head, and, heaving it aloft, brought it down with all his force\non the nut, which was considerably crushed and broken by the blow.  With\nperseverance and the vigorous use of a clasp-knife he at last reached\nthe interior.  Thereafter, on cocoa-nut meat and cocoa-nut milk, with a\ndraught from a pool in the thicket they partook of their first breakfast\non the reef.\n\n\"Now, our first duty is to bury the skeleton,\" said Dominick, when the\nmeal was concluded; \"our next to examine the land; and our last to visit\nthe wreck.  I think we shall be able to do all this in one day.\"\n\nLike many, perhaps we may say most, of man's estimates, Dominick's\ncalculation was short of the mark, for the reef turned out to be\nconsiderably larger than they had at first supposed.  It must be\nremembered that they had, up to that time, seen it only from the low\nlevel of the sea, and from that point of view it appeared to be a mere\nsandbank with a slight elevation in the centre, which was clothed with\nvegetation.  But when the highest point of this elevation was gained,\nthey discovered that it had hidden from their view not only a\nconsiderable stretch of low land which lay behind, but an extensive\ncontinuation of the lagoon, or salt-water lake, in which lay a multitude\nof smaller islets of varying shapes, some mere banks of sand, others\nwith patches of vegetation in their centres, and a few with several\ncocoa-nut palms on them, the nucleus, probably, of future palm groves.\nA large island formed the background to this lovely picture, and the\nirregular coral reef guarded the whole from the violence of the ocean.\nIn some places this reef rose to a considerable height above the\nsea-level.  In others, it was so little above it that each falling\nbreaker almost buried it in foam; but everywhere it was a sufficient\nprotection to the lagoon, which lay calm and placid within, encircled by\nits snowy fringe,--the result of the watery war outside.  In one spot\nthere was a deep entrance into this beautiful haven of peace, and that\nchanced to be close to the golden cave, and was about fifty yards wide.\nAt the extremity of the reef, on the other side of this opening, lay\nanother elevated spot, similar to their own, though smaller, and with\nonly a few palms in the centre of it.  From the sea this eminence had\nappeared to be a continuation of the other, and it was only when they\nlanded that the Rigondas discovered the separation caused by the channel\nleading into the lagoon.\n\n\"Fairyland!\" exclaimed Pauline, who could scarcely contain herself with\ndelight at the marvellous scene of beauty that had so unexpectedly burst\nupon their view.\n\n\"Rather a noisy and bustling fairyland too,\" said Otto, referring to the\nnumerous sea-birds that inquisitively came to look at them, as well as\nto the other waterfowl that went about from isle to isle on whistling\nwings.\n\nThe boy spoke jestingly, but it was clear from his heaving chest,\npartially-open mouth, and glittering eyes, that his little heart was\nstirred to an unwonted depth of emotion.\n\n\"Alas! that we have lost our boat,\" exclaimed Dominick.\n\nTo this Otto replied by expressing an earnest wish that he were able to\nswim as well as a South Sea islander, for in that case he would launch\nforth and spend the remainder of that day in visiting all the islands.\n\n\"Yes; and wouldn't it be charming,\" responded his brother, \"to pay your\naquatic visits in such pleasant company as that?\"\n\nHe pointed to an object, which was visible at no great distance, moving\nabout on the surface of the glassy sea with great activity.\n\n\"What creature is that?\" asked Pauline.\n\n\"It is not a creature, Pina, only part of a creature.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say it's a shark!\" cried Otto, with a frown.\n\n\"Indeed it is--the back-fin of one at least--and he must have heard you,\nfor he seems impatient to join you in your little trip to the islands.\"\n\n\"I'll put it off to some future day, Dom.  But isn't it a pity that such\npretty places should be spoiled by such greedy and cruel monsters?\"\n\n\"And yet they _must_ have been made for some good purpose,\" suggested\nPauline.\n\n\"I rather suspect,\" said Dominick, \"that if game and fish only knew who\nshoot and catch them, and afterwards eat them, they might be inclined to\ncall man greedy and cruel.\"\n\n\"But we can't help that Dom.  We must live, you know.\"\n\n\"So says or thinks the shark, no doubt, when he swallows a man.\"\n\nWhile the abstruse question, to which the shark had thus given rise, was\nbeing further discussed, the explorers returned to the thicket, where\nthey buried the skeleton beside the other graves.  A close search was\nthen made for any object that might identify the unfortunates or afford\nsome clue to their history, but nothing of the sort was found.\n\n\"Strange,\" muttered Dominick, on leaving the spot after completing their\ntask.  \"One would have expected that, with a wrecked ship to fall back\nupon, they would have left behind them evidences of some sort--\nimplements, or books, or empty beef-casks,--but there is literally\nnothing.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" suggested Pauline, \"the men did not belong to this wreck.\nThey may have landed as we have done out of a small boat, and the vessel\nwe now see may have been driven here after they were dead.\"\n\n\"True, Pina, it may have been so.  However, the matter must remain a\nmystery for the present.  Meanwhile we will go and explore the low land\nbehind our reef.\"\n\n\"Isn't it strange, Dom, that we should become landed proprietors in this\nfashion?\" remarked Otto, as they walked along.\n\n\"And that, too,\" added Pauline, \"at a time when our hopes were lowest\nand our case most desperate.\"\n\n\"'Tis a magnificent estate,\" said Dominick, \"of which we will constitute\nPina the Queen, myself the Prime Minister, and Otto the army.\"\n\nTo this Otto objected that, as it was the business of an army to defend\nthe people and keep them in order, there was no use for an army, seeing\nthat there were no people; but Dominick replied that a queen and prime\nminister formed part of a people, and that an army was required to\ndefend _them_.\n\n\"To keep them in order, you should say,\" retorted Otto, \"for that will\nclearly be my chief duty if I accept the situation.  Well, I've no\nobjection, on the whole, to be an army; but, please, remember that in\ntime of peace an army is expected to do no laborious work, and that at\nall times it is clothed and fed by the State.  Now, Queen Pina the\nFirst, what would your Majesty wish the army to do?\"\n\n\"Go forth and subdue the land,\" replied Pina the First, promptly, with\nquite a regal sweep of her hand towards the low ground and the lagoon\nbeyond.\n\n\"Will your Majesty deign to instruct me how I am to begin?\"\n\nThe Queen hesitated.  She was rather puzzled, as rulers sometimes are\nwhen required to tackle details.\n\n\"May it please your Majesty,\" said Dominick, coming to the rescue like a\ntrue premier, \"it is the chief duty of a prime minister to advise his\nsovereign.  If it be your pleasure, I would recommend that the army\nshould be sent down into yonder clump of reeds to ascertain what revenue\nis to be derived from the inhabitants thereof in the shape of wildfowl,\neggs, etcetera, while I visit the shore of the lagoon to ascertain the\nprospects of supply, in the form of shellfish, from that quarter.\nMeanwhile, I would further advise your Majesty to sit down on this coral\nthrone, and enjoy the contemplation of your kingdom till we return.\"\n\nWith a dignified bow and a little laugh Queen Pina assented, and the\nPrime Minister went off to the shore, while the army defiled towards the\nmarsh.\n\nLeft alone, Pina the First soon forgot her royal condition in\ncontemplation of the lovely prospect before her.  As she gazed over the\nsand, and across the lagoon, and out on the gleaming sea, her thoughts\nassumed the wings of the morning and flew away over the mighty ocean to\nold England.  Sadness filled her heart, and tears her eyes, as she\nthought of a mild little mother who had, since the departure of her\nthree children, been reduced for companionship to a huge household cat,\nand who would ere long be wondering why letters were so long of coming\nfrom the dear ones who had left her.\n\nPauline had a vivid imagination and great power of mental abstraction.\nShe summoned up the image of the little mother so successfully that she\nfelt as if she actually saw her knitting her socks, sadly, with her head\non one side.  She even heard her address the cat (she was accustomed to\naddress the cat when alone), and express a hope that in the course of a\nmonth or six weeks more she might expect to have news of the absent\nones.  And Pauline almost saw the household cat, which occupied its\nusual place on the table at the old lady's elbow, blink its eyes with\nsympathy--or indifference, she could not be quite sure which.  Then\nPauline's wayward thoughts took a sudden flight to the island of Java,\nin the China seas, where she beheld a bald little old gentleman--a\nmerchant and a shipowner--who was also her father, and who sat reading a\nnewspaper in his office, and was wondering why his good ship _Flying\nFish_--which was bringing his children to him besides a quantity of\nother goods--did not make its appearance, and she plainly saw the look\nof disappointment as he threw the paper down, exclaiming, \"Odd, very\nodd, but she _must_ turn up soon.\"\n\nPauline saw nothing more after that for some time, because her eyes were\nblinded with tears.\n\nThen Queen Pina cheered up again, for she thought that surely a ship\nwould soon pass the island and take them off.  As this last thought\nbecame more definite (for Pina was very young and hopeful) her eyes\ndried and permitted her to observe her kingdom more clearly.\n\nThe Prime Minister, she observed, was still busy on the shore, and, from\nhis frequently stooping to pick up something, she argued that the\naffairs of State in that quarter were prospering.\n\nPresently, from the midst of a mass of reeds not far off, there arose a\nshout, easily recognisable as that of the army, which was followed by\ncries of a stupendous, yet extremely familiar, kind.  Pauline started up\nin considerable haste, and a moment later beheld the chief authors of\nthe noise burst from the clump of reeds in the form of a large sow and a\ntroop of little pigs.\n\nThey were evidently in a state of wild alarm, for, besides squealing\nwith a degree of intensity possible only to pigs, they ran in such\nfurious haste that they stumbled over sticks and stones in reckless\nconfusion, scrambling to their feet again in such a hurry as to ensure\nrepeated falls, and, generally, twirling themselves and their tails in a\nmanner that was consistent with nothing short of raving madness.\n\nLittle wonder that those creatures acted thus, for, close on their\nheels, gasping and glaring, the army burst forth and fell on them--\nliterally fell on one of them, for Otto in his anxiety to catch the\nhindmost pig, a remarkably small but active animal, tripped over a root\njust as he was about to lay hold of its little tail, and fell on the top\nof it with fearful violence.  The mechanical pressure, combining with\nthe creature's spiritual efforts, produced a sudden yell that threw the\ncries of its companions quite into the shade.  It might have sufficed to\nblow Otto into the air.  Indeed, it seemed as if some such result\nactually followed, for, after turning a complete somersault, the boy was\non his feet again as if by magic; but so also was the little pig, which,\nbeing thus forcibly separated from its family, turned aside and made for\nthe main thicket.  To cut off its retreat, the army made a sudden flank\nmovement, headed the enemy, grasped it by the curly tail, and sought to\nlift it into his arms, but the curly tail straightened out, and, being\nexceedingly thin as well as taper, slipped from his hand.  Need we say\nthat the little pig came to the ground with a remonstrative squeal?  It\nalso rolled over.  Otto, unable to check himself, flew past.  The pig\nrose, diverged, and resumed its headlong flight.  Otto doubled, came\nclose up again, \"stooped to conquer,\" and was on the point of coming off\nvictorious, when, with a final shriek of mingled rage and joy, the enemy\nrushed through a hole under a prickly bush, while the discomfited army\nplunged headlong into the same, and stuck fast.\n\nMeanwhile the rest of the porcine family had found refuge in an almost\nimpenetrable part of the thicket.\n\n\"Pork, your Majesty,\" said Otto, on returning from the field of battle,\n\"may at all events be counted as one of the products of your dominions.\"\n\n\"Truly it would seem so,\" responded the Queen, with a laugh;\n\"nevertheless there does not appear to be much hope of its forming a\nsource of supply to the royal larder.\"\n\n\"Time will show,\" said Dominick, coming up at the moment; \"and see, here\nare several kinds of shellfish, which will form a pleasant addition to\nour fare.\"\n\n\"Ay, and I saw eggs among the reeds,\" said Otto, \"some of which--\"\n\n\"Not pigs' eggs, surely?\" interrupted Dominick.\n\n\"They may be so,\" retorted Otto; \"the fact that English pigs don't lay\neggs, is no argument against South Sea pigs doing so, if they choose.\nBut, as I was about to say, your Majesty, when the Premier interrupted\nme--some of these eggs I gathered, and would have presented them as an\noffering from the army, if I had not fallen and crushed them beyond\nrepair.\"\n\nIn corroboration of what he said, Otto opened his coat pocket and\nrevealed in its depths a mass of yellow substance, and broken shells.\n\n\"Horrible!\" exclaimed Pauline; \"how will you ever get it cleaned?\"\n\n\"By turning it inside out--thus, most gracious Queen.\"\n\nHe reversed the pocket as he spoke, allowing the yellow compound to drip\non the ground, and thereafter wiped it with grass.\n\n\"I wouldn't have minded this loss so much,\" he continued, \"if I had not\nlost that little pig.  But I shall know him again when I see him, and\nyou may depend on it that he is destined ere long to be turned into pork\nchops.\"\n\n\"Well, then, on the strength of that hope we will continue the survey of\nour possessions,\" said Dominick, leading the party still further into\nthe low grounds.\n\nFor some time the trio wandered about without making any further\ndiscoveries of importance until they came to a thicket, somewhat similar\nto the one near which they had been cast on shore, but much smaller.  On\nentering it they were startled by a loud cackling noise, accompanied by\nthe whirring of wings.\n\n\"Sounds marvellously like domestic fowls,\" said Dominick, as he pushed\nforward.  And such it turned out to be, for, on reaching an open glade\nin the thicket, they beheld a large flock of hens running on ahead of\nthem, with a splendid cock bringing up the rear, which turned\noccasionally to cast an indignant look at the intruders.\n\n\"That accounts for your eggs, Otto,\" observed Pauline.\n\n\"Yes, and here are more of them,\" said the boy, pointing to a nest with\nhalf a dozen eggs in it, which he immediately proceeded to gather.\n\n\"It is quite evident to me,\" remarked Dominick, as they continued to\nadvance, \"that both the pigs and fowls must have been landed from the\nwreck that lies on the shore, and that, after the death of the poor\nfellows who escaped the sea, they went wild.  Probably they have\nmultiplied, and we may find the land well stocked.\"\n\n\"I hope so.  Perhaps we may find some more traces of the shipwrecked\ncrew,\" suggested Pauline.\n\nTheir expectations were not disappointed, for, on returning in the\nevening from their tour of exploration, they came on a partially cleared\nplace in the thicket beside the golden cave, which had evidently been\nused as a garden.  In the midst of a mass of luxuriant undergrowth,\nwhich almost smothered them, vegetables of various kinds were found\ngrowing--among others the sweet potato.\n\nGathering some of these, Otto declared joyfully that he meant to have a\nroyal feast that night, but a difficulty which none of them had thought\nof had to be faced and overcome before that feast could be enjoyed.  It\nwas just as they arrived at the golden cave that this difficulty\npresented itself to their minds.\n\n\"Dom,\" said Otto, with a solemn look, \"how are we to make a fire?\"\n\n\"By kindling it, of course.\"\n\n\"Yes, but, you stupid Premier, where are we to find a light?\"\n\n\"To tell you the truth, my boy,\" returned Dominick, \"I never thought of\nthat till this moment, and I can't very well see my way out of the\ndifficulty.\"\n\nPauline, to whom the brothers now looked, shook her head.  Never before,\nshe said, had she occasion to trouble her brain about a light.  When she\nwanted one in England, all she had to do was to call for one, or strike\na match.  What was to be done in their present circumstances she had not\nthe smallest conception.\n\n\"I'll tell you what,\" said Otto, after several suggestions had been made\nand rejected, \"this is how we'll do it.  We will gather a lot of dry\ngrass and dead sticks and build them up into a pile with logs around it,\nthen Pina will sit down and gaze steadily at the heart of the pile for\nsome minutes with her great, brown, sparkling eyes she should be able to\nkindle a flame in the heart of almost anything in five minutes--or, say\nten, at the outside, eh?\"\n\n\"I should think,\" retorted the Queen, \"that your fiery spirit or\nflashing wit might accomplish the feat in a shorter time.\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" remarked Dominick, who had been thinking too hard to\npay much regard to these pleasantries, \"that if we live long here we\nshall have to begin life over again--not our own lives, exactly, but the\nworld's life.  We shall have to invent everything anew for ourselves;\ndiscover new methods of performing old familiar work, and, generally,\nexercise our ingenuity to the uttermost.\"\n\n\"That may be quite true, you philosophic Premier,\" returned Otto, \"but\nit does not light our fire, or roast that old hen which you brought down\nwith a stone so cleverly to-day.  Come, now, let us exercise our\ningenuity a little more to the purpose, if possible.\"\n\n\"If we had only some tinder,\" said Dominick, \"we could find flint, I\ndare say, or some hard kind of stone from which fire could be struck\nwith the back of a clasp-knife, but I have seen nothing like tinder\nto-day.  I've heard that burnt rag makes capital tinder.  If so, a bit\nof Pina's dress might do, but we can't burn it without fire.\"\n\nFor a considerable time the trio sought to devise some means of\nprocuring fire, but without success, and they were at last fain to\ncontent themselves with another cold supper of cocoa-nut and water,\nafter which, being rather tired, they went to rest as on the previous\nnight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR.\n\nDIFFICULTIES MET AND OVERCOME.\n\nThe next day Pauline and her brothers visited the wreck, and here new\ndifficulties met them, for although the vessel lay hard and fast on the\nrocks, there was a belt of water between it and the main shore, which\nwas not only broad, but deep.\n\n\"I can easily swim it,\" said Dominick, beginning to pull off his coat.\n\n\"Dom,\" said Otto, solemnly, \"sharks!\"\n\n\"That's true, my boy, I won't risk it.\"\n\nHe put his coat on again, and turned to look for some drift-wood with\nwhich to make a raft.\n\n\"There's sure to be some lying about, you know,\" he said, \"for a wreck\ncould hardly take place without something or other in the way of spars\nor wreckage being washed ashore.\"\n\n\"But don't you think,\" suggested Otto, \"that the men whose graves we\nhave found may have used it all up?\"\n\nOtto was right.  Not a scrap of timber or cordage of any kind was to be\nfound after a most diligent search, and they were about to give it up in\ndespair, when Pauline remembered the bay where they had been cast\nashore, and which we have described as being filled with wreckage.\n\nIn truth, this bay and the reef with its group of islands lay right in\nthe track of one of those great ocean currents which, as the reader\nprobably knows, are caused by the constant circulation of all the waters\nof the sea between the equator and the poles.  This grand and continuous\nflow is caused by difference of temperature and density in sea-water at\ndifferent places.  At the equator the water is warm, at the poles it is\ncold.  This alone would suffice to cause circulation--somewhat as water\ncirculates in a boiling pot--but other active agents are at work.  The\nArctic and Antarctic snows freshen the sea-water as well as cool it,\nwhile equatorial heat evaporates as well as warms it, and thus leaves a\nsuperabundance of salt and lime behind.  The grand ocean current thus\ncaused is broken up into smaller streams, and the courses of these are\nfixed by the conformation of land--just as a river's flow is turned\nright or left, and sometimes backward in eddies, by the form of its\nbanks and bottom.  Trade winds, and the earth's motion on its axis,\nstill further modify the streams, both as to direction and force.\n\nIt was one of those currents, then, which flowed past the reef and\nsometimes cast vessels and wreckage on its shores.\n\nHastening to the bay, they accordingly found enough of broken spars and\nplanks, to have made half a dozen rafts, twice the size of that required\nto go off with to the wreck; so to work they went at once with eager\nenthusiasm.\n\n\"Hold on!\" shouted Dominick, after a few spars had been collected and\ndragged up on the sand.\n\nOtto and Pauline paused in their labour, and looked anxiously at their\nbrother, for his face wore a perplexed look.\n\n\"We have forgotten that it is impossible to shove a raft of any size,\nbig or little, through these huge breakers, so as to get it round the\npoint, to where the wreck lies.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" cried Otto, with the ready assurance of ignorance, \"we'll\njust drag it overland to the wreck, and launch it there.\"\n\n\"But, Otto, you have not taken into consideration the fact that our raft\nmust be so large that, when finished, the dragging of it over rough\nground would require three or four horses instead of three human\nbeings.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" returned the boy, \"we'll make it small, just big enough to\ncarry one person, and then we'll be able to drag it overland, and can go\noff to the wreck one at a time.\"\n\n\"Now, just think, brainless one,\" retorted Dominick; \"suppose that I\nwere to go off first to the wreck, what then?\"\n\n\"Why, then _I_ would go off next of course, and then Pina would follow,\nand so we'd all get on board one at a time, and explore it together.\"\n\n\"Yes; but what would you come off on?\"\n\n\"The raft, to be sure.\"\n\n\"But the raft, I have supposed, is with me at the wreck.  It won't go\nback to the shore of its own accord to fetch you, and we have no ropes\nwith which to haul it to and fro.\"\n\n\"Then there's nothing for it,\" said Otto, after a few moments' thought,\n\"but to make it big enough for two, or carry over the broken spars and\nplanks piecemeal, and put them together opposite the wreck; so, come\nalong.\"\n\nThis latter plan being adopted, they set to work with energy.  To their\njoy they found not only that a good deal of cordage--somewhat worn,\nindeed, but still serviceable--was mingled with the wreckage, but that\nmany large protruding bolts and rusty nails formed convenient holdfasts,\nwhich facilitated the building up and fastening together of the parts.\n\nAt last, after considerable labour, the raft was got ready early in the\nafternoon, and the brothers, embarking on it with two long poles, pushed\noff to the wreck while Pauline sat on the shore and watched them.\n\nIt was an anxious moment when they drew near enough to observe the\nvessel more distinctly, for it was just possible that they might find in\nher hold a supply of food and things they stood so much in need of,\nwhile, on the other hand, there was a strong probability that everything\nhad been washed out of her long ago, or that her former crew had taken\nout all that was worth removing.\n\n\"What if we should find casks of biscuits and barrels of pork, to say\nnothing of tea and sugar, and such like?\" murmured the sanguine Otto, as\nthey poled slowly out.\n\n\"And what if we should find nothing at all?\" said Dominick.\n\n\"O Dom!\" exclaimed Otto, in a voice so despairing that his companion\nturned to look at him in surprise.  \"Look! see! the ship has been on\nfire!  It can only be the mere skeleton that is left.\"\n\nDominick turned quickly, and saw that his brother had reason for this\nremark.  They had by that time approached so near to the wreck that the\ncharred condition of part of her bulwarks, and specially of her lower\nspars, became obvious; and when, a few minutes later, they stood on the\ndeck, the scene that presented itself was one of black desolation.\nEvidently the ill-fated vessel had been enveloped in flames, for\neverything on board was charred, and it was almost certain that her crew\nhad run her on the rocks as the only method of escaping, her boats\nhaving been totally destroyed, as was apparent from the small portions\nof them that still hung from the davits.\n\n\"Nothing left!\" said Otto.  \"I think that Robinson Crusoe himself would\nhave given way to despair if _his_ wreck had been anything like this.  I\nwonder that even this much of it has been left above water after fire\nhad got hold of it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the hull sank after the first crash on the rocks, and put out\nthe fire,\" suggested Dominick, \"and then subsequent gales may have\ndriven her higher up.  Even now her stern lies pretty deep, and\neverything in her hold has been washed away.\"\n\nThere could be no doubt as to the latter point, for the deck had been\nblown up, probably by gunpowder, near the main-hatch, leaving a great\nhole, through which the hold could be seen almost as far as the bulkhead\nof the forecastle.\n\nHastening forward to the hatchway of this part of the vessel, in the\nfeeble hope that they might still find something that would be of use,\nthey descended quickly, but the first glance round quenched such a hope,\nfor the fire had done its work there effectually, and, besides, there\nwere obvious indications that, what the fire had spared, her crew had\ncarried away.  The only things left of any value were the charred\nremnants of the hammocks and bedding which had belonged to the sailors.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Otto, with a sudden burst of joy, as he leaped forward\nand dragged out a quantity of the bedding; \"here's what'll make fire at\nlast!  You said, Dom, that burnt rag was capital tinder.  Well, here we\nhave burnt sheets enough to last us for years to come!\"\n\n\"That's true,\" returned Dominick, laughing at his brother's enthusiasm;\n\"let's go aft and see if we can stumble on something more.\"\n\nBut the examination of the after part of the vessel yielded no fruit.\nAs we have said, that part was sunk deeply, so that only the cabin\nskylight was above water, and, although they both gazed intently down\nthrough the water with which the cabin was filled, they could see\nnothing whatever.  With a boat-hook which they found jammed in the port\nbulwarks, they poked and groped about for a considerable time, but\nhooked nothing, and were finally obliged to return empty-handed to the\nanxious Pauline.\n\nOtto did not neglect, however, to carry off a pocketful of\nburnt-sheeting, by means of which, with flint and steel, they were\nenabled that night to eat their supper by the blaze of a cheering fire.\nThe human heart when young, does not quickly or easily give way to\ndespondency.  Although the Rigondas had thus been cast on an island in\nthe equatorial seas, and continued week after week to dwell there,\nliving on wild fruits and eggs, and such animals and birds as they\nmanaged to snare, with no better shelter than a rocky cavern, and with\nlittle prospect of a speedy release, they did not by any means mourn\nover their lot.\n\n\"You see,\" remarked Otto, one evening when his sister wondered, with a\nsigh, whether their mother had yet begun to feel very anxious about\nthem, \"you see, she could not have expected to hear much before this\ntime, for the voyage to Eastern seas is always a long one, and it is\nwell known that vessels often get blown far out of their courses by\nmonsoons, and simoons, and baboons, and such like southern hurricanes,\nso motherkins won't begin to grow anxious, I hope, for a long time yet,\nand it's likely that before she becomes _very_ uneasy about us, some\nship or other will pass close enough to see our signals and take us off\nso--\"\n\n\"By the way,\" interrupted Dominick, \"have you tried to climb our\nsignal-tree, as you said you would do, to replace the flag that was\nblown away by last night's gale?\"\n\n\"Of course not.  There's no hurry, Dom,\" answered Otto, who, if truth\nmust be told, was not very anxious to escape too soon from his present\nromantic position, and thought that it would be time enough to attract\nthe attention of any passing vessel when they grew tired of their\nsolitude.  \"Besides,\" he continued, with that tendency to self-defence\nwhich is so natural to fallen humanity, \"I'm not a squirrel to run up\nthe straight stem of a branchless tree, fifty feet high or more.\"\n\n\"No, my boy, you're not a squirrel, but, as I have often told you, you\nare a monkey--at least, monkey enough to accomplish your ends when you\nhave a mind to.\"\n\n\"Now, really you are too hard,\" returned Otto, who was busily employed\nas he spoke in boring a hole through a cocoa-nut to get at the milk,\n\"you know very well that the branch of the neighbouring tree by which we\nmanaged to reach the branches of the signal-tree has been blown away, so\nthat the thing is impossible, for the stem is far too big to be climbed\nin the same way as I get up the cocoa-nut trees.\"\n\n\"That has nothing to do with the question,\" retorted Dominick, \"you\n_said_ you would try.\"\n\nOtto looked with an injured expression at his sister and asked what she\nthought of a man being required to attempt impossibilities.\n\n\"Not a man--a monkey,\" interjected his brother.\n\n\"Whether man or monkey,\" said Pauline, in her quiet but decided way, \"if\nyou promised to attempt the thing, you are bound to try.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I will try, and here, I drink success to the trial.\"  Otto\napplied the cocoa-nut to his lips, and took a long pull.  \"Come along,\nnow, the sooner I prove the impossibility the better.\"\n\nRising at once, with an injured expression, the boy led the way towards\na little eminence close at hand, on the top of which grew a few trees of\nvarious kinds, the tallest of these being the signal-tree, to which\nDominick had fixed one of the half-burnt pieces of sheeting, brought\nfrom the wreck.  The stem was perfectly straight and seemingly smooth,\nand as they stood at its foot gazing up to the fluttering little piece\nof rag that still adhered to it, the impossibility of the ascent became\nindeed very obvious.\n\n\"Now, sir, are you convinced?\" said Otto.\n\n\"No, sir, I am not convinced,\" returned Dominick.\n\n\"You said you would try.\"\n\nWithout another word Otto grasped the stem of the tree with arms and\nlegs, and did his best to ascend it.  He had, in truth, so much of the\nmonkey in him, and was so wiry and tough, that he succeeded in getting\nup full twelve or fourteen feet before being utterly exhausted.  At that\npoint, however, he stuck, but instead of slipping down as he had\nintended, and again requesting to know whether his brother was\nconvinced, he uttered a sharp cry, and shouted--\n\n\"Oh!  I say, Dom, what am I to do?\"\n\n\"Why, slip down, of course.\"\n\n\"But I can't.  The bark seems to be made of needle-joints, all sticking\nupwards.  If I try to slip, my trousers vill remain behind, and--and--I\ncan't hold on much longer!\"\n\n\"Let go then, and drop,\" said Dominick, stepping close to the tree.\n\n\"Oh no, don't!\" cried Pauline, with a little shriek; \"if you do you'll--\nyou'll--\"\n\n\"Bust!  Yes, I know I shall,\" shouted Otto, in despair.\n\n\"No fear,\" cried Dominick, holding out his arms, \"let go, I'll cat--\"\n\nHe was stopped abruptly by receiving a shock from his little brother\nwhich sent him sprawling on his back.  He sprang up, however, with a\ngasp.\n\n\"Why, boy, I had no idea you were so heavy,\" he exclaimed, laughing.\n\n\"Now, don't you go boasting in future, you prime minister, that I can't\nknock you down,\" said Otto, as he gathered himself up.  \"But I say,\nyou're not hurt, are you?\" he added, with a look of concern, while\nPauline seized one of Dominick's hands and echoed the question.\n\n\"Not in the least--only a little wind knocked out of me.  Moreover, I'm\nnot yet convinced that the ascent of that tree is an impossibility.\"\n\n\"You'll have to do it yourself, then,\" said Otto; \"and let me warn you\nbeforehand that, though I'm very grateful to you, I won't stand under to\ncatch you.\"\n\n\"Was it not you who said the other night at supper that whatever a\nfellow resolved to do he could accomplish, and added that, where there's\na will, there's a way?\"\n\n\"I rather think it was you, Dom, who gave expression to those boastful\nsentiments.\"\n\n\"It may be so.  At all events I hold them.  Come, now, lend a hand and\nhelp me.  The work will take some time, as we have no other implements\nthan our gully-knives, but we'll manage it somehow.\"\n\n\"Can I not help you?\" asked Pauline.\n\n\"Of course you can.  Sit down on the bank here, and I'll give you\nsomething to do presently.\"\n\nDominick went, as he spoke, to a small tree, the bark of which was long,\ntough, and stringy.  Cutting off a quantity of this, he took it to his\nsister, and showed her how to twist some of it into stout cordage.\nLeaving her busily at work on this, he went down to the nearest bamboo\nthicket and cut a stout cane.  It took some time to cut, for the bamboo\nwas hard and the knife small for such work.  From the end of the cane he\ncut off a piece about a foot in length.\n\n\"Now, Otto, my boy, you split that into four pieces, and sharpen the end\nof each piece, while I cut off another foot of the bamboo.\"\n\n\"But what are you going to do with these bits of stick?\" asked Otto, as\nhe went to work with a will.\n\n\"You shall see.  No use in wasting time with explanations just now.  I\nread of the plan in a book of travels.  There's nothing like a good book\nof travels to put one up to numerous dodges.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure o' that,\" objected the boy.  \"I have read _Robinson\nCrusoe_ over and over, and over again, and I don't recollect reading of\nhis having made use of pegs to climb trees with.\"\n\n\"Your memory may be at fault, perhaps.  Besides, Robinson's is not the\nonly book of travels in the world,\" returned Dominick, as he hacked away\nat the stout bamboo.\n\n\"No; but it is certainly the best,\" returned Otto, with enthusiasm, \"and\nI mean to imitate its hero.\"\n\n\"Don't do that, my boy,\" said Dominick; \"whatever you do, don't imitate.\nAct well the part allotted to you, whatever it may be, according to the\npromptings of your own particular nature; but don't imitate.\"\n\n\"Humph!  I won't be guided by your wise notions, Mr Premier.  All I\nknow is, that I wish my clothes would wear out faster, so that I might\ndress myself in skins of some sort.  I would have made an umbrella by\nthis time, but it never seems to rain in this country.\"\n\n\"Ha!  Wait till the rainy season comes round, and you'll have more than\nenough of it.  Come, we've got enough of pegs to begin with.  Go into\nthe thicket now; cut some of the longest bamboos you can find, and bring\nthem to me; six or eight will do--slender ones, about twice the\nthickness of my thumb at the ground.\"\n\nWhile Otto was engaged in obeying this order, his brother returned to\nthe signal-tree.\n\n\"Well done, Pina,\" he said; \"you've made some capital cordage.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do now, brother?\"\n\n\"You shall see,\" said Dominick, picking up a heavy stone to use as a\nhammer, with which he drove one of the hard, sharp pegs into the tree,\nat about three feet from the ground.  We have said the peg was a foot\nlong.  As he fixed it in the tree about three inches deep, nine inches\nof it projected.  On this he placed his foot and raised himself to test\nits strength.  It bore his weight well.  Above this first peg he fixed a\nsecond, three feet or so higher, and then a third about level with his\nface.\n\n\"Ah!  I see,\" exclaimed Otto, coming up at that moment with several long\nbamboos.  \"But, man, don't you see that if one of these pegs should give\nway while you're driving those above it, down you come by the run, and,\nif you should be high up at the time, death will be probable--lameness\nfor life, certain.\"\n\nDominick did not condescend to answer this remark, but, taking one of\nthe bamboos, stood it up close to the tree, not touching, but a few\ninches from the trunk, and bound it firmly with the cord to the three\npegs.  Thus he had the first three rounds or rungs of an upright ladder,\none side of which was the tree, the other the bamboo.  Mounting the\nsecond of these rungs he drove in a fourth peg, and fastened the bamboo\nto it in the same way, and then, taking another step, he fixed a fifth\npeg.  Thus, step by step, he mounted till he had reached between fifteen\nand twenty feet from the ground, where the upright bamboo becoming too\nslender, another was called for and handed up by Otto.  This was lashed\nto the first bamboo, as well as to three of the highest pegs, and the\noperation was continued.  When the thin part of the second long bamboo\nwas reached, a third was added; and so the work progressed until the\nladder was completed, and the lower branches of the tree were gained.\n\nLong before that point, however, Otto begged to be allowed to continue\nand finish the work, which his brother agreed to, and, finally, the\nsignal flag was renewed, by the greater part of an old hammock being\nlashed to the top of the tree.\n\nBut weeks and months passed away, and the flag continued to fly without\nattracting the attention of any one more important, or more powerful to\ndeliver them, than the albatross and the wild sea-mew.\n\nDuring this period the ingenuity and inventive powers of the party were\ntaxed severely, for, being utterly destitute of tools of any kind, with\nthe exception of the gully-knives before mentioned, they found it\nextremely difficult to fashion any sort of implement.\n\n\"If we had only an axe or a saw,\" said Otto one morning, with a groan of\ndespair, \"what a difference it would make.\"\n\n\"Isn't there a proverb,\" said Pauline, who at the time was busy making\ncordage while Otto was breaking sticks for the fire, \"which says that we\nnever know our mercies till we lose them?\"\n\n\"Perhaps there is,\" said Otto, \"and if there isn't, I don't care.  I\ndon't like proverbs, they always tell you in an owlishly wise sort o'\nway what you know only too well, at a time when you'd rather not know it\nif possible.  Now, if we only had an axe--ever so small--I would be able\nto fell trees and cut 'em up into big logs, instead of spending hours\nevery day searching for dead branches and breaking them across my knee.\nIt's not a pleasant branch of our business, I can tell you.\"\n\n\"But you have the variety of hunting,\" said his sister, \"and that, you\nknow, is an agreeable as well as useful branch.\"\n\n\"Humph!  It's not so agreeable as I used to think it would be, when one\nhas to run after creatures that run faster than one's-self, and one is\nobliged to use wooden spears, and slings, instead of guns.  By the way,\nwhat a surprising, I may say awful, effect a well-slung stone has on the\nside of a little pig!  I came upon a herd yesterday in the cane-brake,\nand, before they could get away, I slung a big stone at them, which\ncaught the smallest of the squeakers fair in the side.  The sudden\nsqueal that followed the slap was so intense, that I thought the life\nhad gone out of the creature in one agonising gush; but it hadn't, so I\nslung another stone, which took it in the head and dropt it.\"\n\n\"Poor thing!  I wonder how you can be so cruel.\"\n\n\"Cruel!\" exclaimed Otto, \"I don't do it for pleasure, do I?  Pigs and\nother things have got to be killed if we are to live.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose so,\" returned Pauline, with a sigh; \"at all events it\nwould never do to roast and eat them alive.  But, about the axe.  Is\nthere no iron-work in the wreck that might be fashioned into one?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, sister dear,\" returned Otto, with a short laugh, \"there's\nplenty of iron-work.  Some crowbars and ringbolts, and an anchor or two;\nbut do you suppose that I can slice off a bit of an anchor in the shape\nof an axe as you slice a loaf?\"\n\n\"Well no, not exactly, but I thought there might be some small flat\npieces that could be made to do.\"\n\n\"What is your difficulty,\" asked Dominick, returning from a hunting\nexpedition at that moment, and flinging down three brace of fowls on the\nfloor of the golden cave.\n\nWhen the difficulty was stated, he remarked that he had often pondered\nthe matter while lying awake at night, and when wandering in the woods;\nand he had come to the conclusion that they must return to what was\ntermed the stone period of history, and make their axes of flint.\n\nOtto shook his head, and thought Pina's idea of searching the wreck till\nthey found a piece of flat metal was a more hopeful scheme.\n\n\"What do you say to trying both plans?\" cried Pauline, with sudden\nanimation.  \"Come, as you have voluntarily elected me queen of this\nrealm, I command you, Sir Dominick, to make a flint axe without delay,\nand you, Sir Otto, to make an iron one without loss of time.\"\n\n\"Your majesty shall be obeyed,\" replied her obedient subjects, and to\nwork they went accordingly, the very next morning.\n\nDominick searched far and near for a flint large enough for his purpose.\nHe found several, and tried to split them by laying them on a flat\nstone, upheaving another stone as large as he could lift, and hurling it\ndown on them with all his might.  Sometimes the flint would fly from\nunder the stone without being broken, sometimes it would be crushed to\nfragments, and at other times would split in a manner that rendered it\nquite unsuitable.  At last, however, by patient perseverance, he\nsucceeded in splitting one so that an edge of it was thin and sharp,\nwhile the other end was thick and blunt.\n\nDelighted with this success, he immediately cut with his knife, a branch\nof one of the hardest trees he could find, and formed it into an\naxe-handle.  Some of Pauline's cord he tied round the middle of this,\nand then split it at one end, using his flint for the purpose, and a\nstone for a hammer.  The split extended only as far as the cord, and he\nforced it open by means of little stones as wedges until it was wide\nenough to admit the thick end of his flint axe-head.  Using a piece of\nsoft stone as a pencil, he now marked the form of the flint, where it\ntouched the wood, exactly, and worked at this with his knife, as\npatiently as a Chinaman, for several hours, until the wood fitted the\nirregularities and indentations of the flint to a nicety.  This of\nitself caused the wood to hold the flint-head very firmly.  Then the\nwedges were removed, and when the handle was bound all round the split\npart with cord, and the flint-head enveloped in the same, the whole\nthing became like a solid mass.\n\nGingerly and anxiously did Dominick apply it to a tree.  To his joy his\naxe caused the chips to fly in all directions.  He soon stopped,\nhowever, for fear of breaking it, and set off in triumph to the golden\ncave.\n\nMeanwhile Otto, launching the raft, went on board the wreck to search\nfor a suitable bit of iron.  As he had said, there was plenty on board,\nbut none of the size or shape that he required, and he was about to quit\nin despair when he observed the flat iron plates, about five inches\nsquare and quarter of an inch thick, with a large hole in the centre of\neach, which formed the sockets that held the davits for suspending the\nship's boats.  A crowbar enabled him, after much trouble, to wrench off\none of these.  A handspike was, after some hours' labour, converted into\na handle with one side cut flat.  Laying the plate on this, he marked\nits exact size, and then cut away the wood until the iron sank its own\nthickness into it.  There were plenty of nails in the wreck; with these\nhe nailed the iron, through its own nail-holes, to the hard handspike,\nand, still further to secure it, he covered it with a little piece of\nflat wood, which he bound firmly on with some cordage made by his sister\nfrom cocoa-nut fibre.  As the iron projected on both sides of the\nhandle, it thus formed a double-edged axe of the most formidable\nappearance.  Of course the edges required grinding down, but this was a\nmere matter of detail, to be accomplished by prolonged and patient\nrubbing on a stone!\n\nOtto arrived triumphantly at the golden cave almost at the same moment\nwith his brother, and they both laid their axes at the feet of the\nqueen.\n\n\"Thanks, my trusty vassals,\" she said; \"I knew you would both succeed,\nand had prepared a royal feast against your return.\"\n\n\"To which I have brought a royal appetite, your majesty,\" said Otto.\n\n\"In truth so have I,\" added Dominick.\n\nThere was a good deal of jesting in all this; nevertheless the trio sat\ndown to supper that night highly pleased with themselves.  While eating,\nthey discussed, with much animation, the merits of the axes, and\nexperienced no little difficulty in deciding which was the better tool.\nAt last Pauline settled the matter by declaring that the iron axe, being\nthe strongest, was, perhaps, the best; but as it was not yet sharpened,\nwhile Dominick's was ready for immediate use, the flint axe was in\npresent circumstances better.\n\n\"So then, being equal,\" said Otto, \"and having had a splendid supper, we\nwill retire to rest.\"\n\nThus, in devising means for increasing their comforts, and supplying\ntheir daily necessities, the days and weeks flew swiftly by.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIVE.\n\nSTIRRING EVENTS AND CHANGES.\n\nAn event was now pending over the castaway family which was destined to\ndarken their bright sky, and interrupt them in the even tenor of their\nway.\n\nUp to this time the interest, not to say delight, with which they went\nabout their daily avocations, the fineness of the weather, and the\nromance of their situation, had prevented their minds from dwelling much\non the flight of time, and if Pauline had not remembered the Sundays by\nconscientiously keeping a daily record with a pencil on a piece of bark,\nnot one of them would have believed it possible that two months had\nelapsed since they were cast ashore.\n\nThe sanguine hope, too, which filled the breast of each, that a vessel\nwould certainly pass by sooner or later and take them off, prevented\ntheir being disturbed by gloomy anticipations of a long exile, and it is\nprobable that they would have gone on pleasantly for a much longer time,\nimproving the golden cave, and exploring the reef, and developing the\nresources of what Otto styled the Queendom, without much caring about\nthe future, had not the event above referred to come upon them with the\nsudden violence of a thunder-clap, terminating their peaceful life in a\nway they had never anticipated, and leading to changes which the wildest\nimagination could hardly have conceived.\n\nThat event was, indeed, the arrival of a ship, but it did not arrive in\nthe manner that had been expected.  It came in the dead of a dark night,\nwhen the elements seemed to have declared fierce war against each other,\nfor it was difficult to say whether the roaring of the sea, the crashing\nof the thunder, or the flashing of the forked lightning was most\ntremendous.\n\nA previous storm or two, of a mild type, having warned our trio that\nParadise had not been quite regained, even in that lovely region, they\nhad fitted something like a front, formed of wreckage, to the golden\ncave, and this had, up to that time, formed a sufficient protection\nagainst slight inclemencies of weather; but on this particular night the\ngusts of wind were so violent, and shook the front of their dwelling so\nmuch, that both Dominick and his brother found it impossible to sleep.\nTheir sister, however, lay undisturbed, because she reposed in an inner\nchamber, which had been screened off with broken planks, and these not\nonly checked draughts, but deadened sounds.\n\n\"I'm afraid our wall will come down,\" said Dominick, raising himself at\nlast on one elbow, and gazing at the wooden erection uneasily.\n\n\"Oh, let it come!\" growled Otto, who had been so frequently checked\nwhile dropping into slumber that night that he was getting quite cross.\n\nNot feeling quite so regardless of consequences, his brother Dominick\narose and endeavoured to prop the weak part of the structure with an\nadditional piece of timber.\n\nHe had accomplished his object, and was about to lie down again to rest,\nwhen a terrible cry was heard, which rose above the roaring of the\nstorm.  There seemed something so appalling in it, and at the same time\nso unaccountable in that solitary spot, that Dominick's heart almost\nstood still for a moment with superstitious fear.  Otto also heard the\ncry, and sat bolt upright, while drowsiness was effectually banished\nfrom his brain.\n\n\"Dom, did you hear that?\" he asked in a solemn voice.  \"I should think I\ndid,\" replied his brother in a low tone.  The cave being very dark,\nneither could see the other distinctly.  They sat silent for a few\nmoments, anxiously listening for a repetition of the cry.\n\n\"Move quietly, Otto,\" said Dominick, as he crept towards their little\ndoor, \"it evidently has not awaked Pina, and we may as well let her lie\nstill till we find out what it is.\"\n\n\"You're not going out, Dom?\" asked Otto, in anxiety.\n\n\"Yes, why not?\"\n\n\"Be--because--it--it may be--be--something--_awful_!\"\n\n\"It _must_ be something awful, and that is just why I am going out.\nCome, you didn't use to be a coward.\"\n\nThis was touching the boy on a tender point.  He was indeed by no means\na coward when the danger he had to face was comprehensible and obvious,\nbut when the danger happened to be incomprehensible, as well as\ninvisible, his courage was not quite as high as might have been desired.\nThe taunt of his brother stirred up his pride however.  He rose and\nfollowed him in silence, with stern resolve and a quaking heart!\n\nOn issuing from their shelter the brothers had to lean heavily against\nthe blast to prevent their being swept away.  Seeking the shelter of a\nbush, they gazed around them, but saw nothing save a dim appearance of\nbending trees and scudding foam.\n\n\"The cry may have come from the beach; let's go down,\" said Dominick,\nleaving the shelter of the bush, and pushing forward.\n\n\"Better go back,\" was on Otto's lips, but he repressed the words and\nfollowed.\n\nThere was not light enough to enable them to see objects on land, but\nwhatever chanced to be pictured against the dark sky became distinctly\nvisible as a dark object.  The old familiar wreck was therefore seen the\nmoment they cleared the bushes that fringed the bay, but close to it was\nanother object which was very unfamiliar indeed to their eyes.  It\naccounted for the cry and caused a gush of mingled feelings in the\nbreasts of the brothers.\n\nLet us now, good reader, wing our flight out to sea, and backwards a\nlittle in time.  On that stormy night of which we treat, a large\nemigrant ship was scudding before the gale almost under bare poles.\nPart of her sails and rigging had been carried away; the rest of her was\nmore or less damaged.  The officers, having had no reliable observation\nfor several days, were not sure of their exact position on the great\nocean, and the captain, being well aware of the danger of those seas,\nwas filled with anxiety.  To add to his troubles, the crew had become\nslightly mutinous, and some of the emigrants--of whom there were upwards\nof three hundred on board--sided with the crew.  It was even whispered\nthat the chief mate was at the bottom of a plot to murder the captain\nand seize the ship.  For what purpose, of course, no one could tell,\nand, indeed, there was no apparent ground for the rumour, beyond the\nfact that the mate--Malines by name--was a surly, taciturn man, with a\nscowling, though handsome, visage, and a powerful frame.\n\nBut whatever of truth might have been in these rumours was never brought\nto light, for an accident occurred during the gale which put the\ncommander of the vessel beyond the power of earthly foes.  One of the\nlarger ropes of the vessel snapt, and the heavy block attached to it\nswung against the captain with such violence as to kill him on the spot.\nThe momentary confusion which followed the disaster distracted the\nattention of the steersman, and a heavy sea was shipped, by which the\ncaptain's body was swept overboard.  No attempt was made to lower a boat\nor check the ship.  Even the unskilled emigrants understood that no boat\ncould live in such a sea, and that rescue was impossible.  The vessel\nheld on her wild course as if nothing had happened.\n\nMalines, being now in command, issued an order that all the emigrants\nshould go below, and the hatches be secured.\n\nThe women and children and most of the men were already in their\nuncomfortable quarters below hatches, but a group of hardy-looking\nfellows, who held on to ropes and stanchions near the windlass, refused\nto move.  Among them was a remarkably powerful woman, whose tongue\nafforded presumptive evidence that she had been born in the Emerald\nIsle.\n\n\"We'll stop where we be, master,\" said one of the emigrants, with a\nquiet but resolute air.\n\n\"That's right, Joe, stick up.  We ain't slaves,\" said another.\n\nTo this last speaker Malines turned fiercely and knocked him down; then,\nseizing him by the collar and dragging him to the hatchway, he thrust\nhim below.  It may be remarked that the man thus roughly treated--\nRedding by name--was a little man.  Bullies usually select little men\nwhen inclined to display their courage.\n\n\"Shame on yez,\" exclaimed the Irish woman, clenching her huge fist.  \"If\nit wasn't that I'm a poor widdy woman, I'd--I'd--\"\n\n\"Howld yer tongue, Mother Lynch,\" whispered a lively youth of about\nnineteen by her side, who obviously hailed from the same country.  \"It's\nnot aggravatin' him that'll do _him_ good.  Let him be, darlin', and\nhe'll soon blow the steam off.\"\n\n\"An' what does it matter to me, Teddy Malone, whether he blows the steam\noff, or keeps it down till he bursts his biler?  Is it a descendant o'\nthe royal family o' Munster as'll howld her tongue whin she sees cruelty\nand injustice?\"\n\nWithout paying the slightest regard to this royal personage, Malines\nreturned to the group of men, and repeated his order to go below; but\nthey did not go, and he seized a handspike with a view to enforce his\ncommands.  He hesitated, however, on observing that the man named Joe,\nafter quietly buttoning his coat, was turning up his wristbands as if in\npreparation for a pugilistic encounter.\n\n\"Lookee here now, Mister Malines,\" said Joe, with a mild, even kindly,\nexpression, which was the very reverse of belligerent; \"I was allers a\nlaw-abidin' man myself, and don't have no love for fightin'; but when\nI'm ordered to go into a dark hole, and have the lid shut down on me an'\nlocked, I feels a sort of objection, d'ee see.  If you lets us be, us'll\nlet you be.  If otherwise--\"\n\nJoe stopped abruptly, grinned, and clenched his enormous fists.\n\nMr Malines was one of those wise men who know when they have met their\nmatch.  His knockings down and overbearing ways always stopped short at\nthat line where he met courage and strength equal or superior to his\nown.  He possessed about the average of bull-dog courage and more than\nthe average of physical strength, but observing that Joe was gifted with\nstill more of both these qualities, he lowered the handspike, and with a\nsneer replied--\n\n\"Oh, well--please yourselves.  It matters nothing to me if you get\nwashed overboard.  Make all fast, lads,\" he added, turning to his crew,\nwho stood prepared for what one of them styled a scrimmage.  Malines\nreturned to the quarter-deck, followed by a half-suppressed laugh from\nsome of the mutinous emigrants.\n\n\"You see, David,\" remarked Joe, in a quiet tone, to a man beside him, as\nhe turned down his cuffs, \"I think, from the look of him, that if we was\nto strike on rocks, or run on shore, or take to sinking, or anything o'\nthat sort, the mate is mean enough to look arter hisself and leave the\npoor things below to be choked in a hole.  So you an' me must keep on\ndeck, so as to let 'em all out if need be.\"\n\n\"Right, Joe, right you are.\"\n\nThe man who thus replied bore such a strong resemblance to Joe in grave\nkindliness of expression and colossal size of frame, that even a\nstranger could not fail to recognise them as brothers, and such they\nwere--in truth they were twins, having first seen the light together\njust thirty years before.  There was this difference in the character of\nthe brothers, however, that Joe Binney was the more intellectual and\nresolute of the two.  David Binney, recognising this fact, and loving\nhis brother with all the fervour of a strong nature, was in the habit of\nlooking up to him for advice, and submitting to him as if he had been an\nelder brother.  Nevertheless, David was not without a mind of his own,\nand sometimes differed in opinion with Joe.  He even occasionally\ndisputed, but never with the slightest tinge of ill-feeling.\n\nWhile the brothers were conversing in an undertone on the dangers of the\nsea, and the disagreeables of a fore-cabin, the mass of unfortunates\nbelow were cowering in their berths, rendered almost forgetful of the\nstifling atmosphere, and the wailing of sick children, by the fear of\nshipwreck, as they listened with throbbing hearts to the howling wind\nand rattling cordage overhead, and felt the tremendous shocks when the\ngood ship was buffeted by the sea.\n\nNear to Joe Binney stood one of the sailors on outlook.  He was a\ndark-complexioned, savage-looking man, who had done more than any one\nelse to foment the bad feeling that had existed between the captain and\nhis men.\n\n\"Ye look somethin' skeared, Hugh Morris,\" said Joe, observing that the\nlook-out was gazing over the bow with an expression of alarm.\n\n\"Breakers ahead!\" roared the man at that moment--\"port!--hard-a-port!\"\n\nThe order was sharply repeated, and promptly obeyed, and the vessel came\nround in time to escape destruction on a ledge of rocks, over which the\nwater was foaming furiously.\n\nInstantly Malines went forward and began to give hurried directions to\nthe steersman.  The danger was avoided, though the escape was narrow,\nand the low rocks were seen passing astern, while the sea ahead seemed\nto be free from obstruction, as far, at least, as the profound darkness\npermitted them to see.\n\n\"They'll be all drowned like rats in a hole if we strike,\" muttered the\nsailor, Hugh Morris, as if speaking to himself.\n\n\"Not if I can help it,\" said Joe Binney, who overheard the remark.\n\nAs he spoke he went to the little companion hatch, or door to the\nfore-cabin, and tried to open it, but could not.\n\n\"Here, David,\" he cried, \"lend a hand.\"\n\nApplying their united strength--with some assistance from Teddy Malone,\nand earnest encouragement from Mrs Lynch--they succeeded in bursting\nopen the hatch.\n\n\"Hallo! there,\" shouted Joe, in a voice that would have been creditable\nto a boatswain, \"come on deck if ye don't want to be drownded.\"\n\n\"Hooroo!\" added Malone, \"we're goin' to the bottom!  Look alive wid ye.\"\n\n\"Ay, an' bring up the childers,\" yelled Mrs Lynch.  \"Don't lave wan o'\nthim below.\"\n\nOf course, the poor emigrants were not slow to obey these startling\norders.\n\nThe state of affairs was so serious that Malines either did not see, or\ndid not care for, what was going on.  He stood on the forecastle looking\nout intently ahead.\n\n\"Land on the starboard beam!\" shouted Morris suddenly.\n\nThe mate was on the point of giving an order to the steersman when he\nobserved land looming on the port bow.  Instantly he saw that all hope\nwas over.  They were steering to inevitable destruction between two\nledges of rock!  What he would have done in the circumstances no one can\ntell, because before he had time to act the vessel struck with great\nviolence, and the terror-stricken passengers gave vent to that appalling\ncry of fear which had so suddenly aroused Dominick Rigonda and his\nbrother.\n\nAs the vessel remained hard and fast, with her bow thrust high on the\nrocks, the emigrants and crew found a partial refuge from the violence\nof the waves on the forecastle.  Hence the first wild shriek of fear was\nnot repeated.  In a few minutes, however, a wave of greater size than\nusual came rushing towards the vessel.  Fortunately, most of the\nemigrants failed to realise the danger, but the seamen were fully alive\nto it.\n\n\"It's all over with us,\" exclaimed the mate, in a sort of reckless\ndespair.  But he was wrong.  The great billow, which he expected would\ndash the vessel in pieces--and which, in nine cases out of ten, would\nhave done so--lifted the wreck so high as to carry it almost completely\nover the ledge, on which it had struck, leaving the stern high on the\nrocks, while the bow was plunged into the partly-protected water on the\nother side.\n\nThe sudden descent of the forecastle induced the belief an many of the\nemigrants' minds that they were about to go headlong to the bottom, and\nanother cry of terror arose; but when they found that their place of\nrefuge sank no further than to a level with the water, most of them took\nheart again, and began to scramble up to the quarter-deck as hastily as\nthey had before scrambled to the forecastle.\n\n\"Something like land ahead,\" observed Hugh Morris, who stood close to\nthe mate.\n\n\"I don't see it,\" returned the latter, gruffly, for he was jealous of\nthe influence that Morris had over the crew, and, during the whole\nvoyage, had treated him harshly.\n\n\"It may be there, although you don't see it,\" retorted Hugh, with a\nfeeling of scorn, which he made no attempt to conceal.\n\n\"Sure I sees somethin' movin' on the wather,\" exclaimed Mrs Lynch, who,\nduring the occurrences just described, had held on to a belaying pin\nwith the tenacity and strength of an octopus.\n\n\"It's the wather movin' in yer own eyes, mother,\" said Malone, who stood\nbeside his Amazonian countrywoman.\n\nAt that moment a halloo was heard faintly in the distance, and, soon\nafter, a raft was seen approaching, guided, apparently, by two men.\n\n\"Raft a-hoy!  Where d'ee hail from?\" shouted the mate.\n\n\"From nowhere!\" came back promptly in a boy's ringing voice.\n\n\"You've got on a coral reef,\" shouted a powerful voice, which, we need\nscarcely say, was that of Dominick Rigonda, \"but you're safe enough now.\nThe last wave has shoved you over into sheltered water.  You're in\nluck.  We'll soon put you on shore.\"\n\n\"An island, I suppose,\" said Malines, as the raft came alongside.  \"What\nmay be its name?\"\n\n\"Got no name that I know of; as far as I know it's uninhabited, and,\nprobably, unknown.  Only three of us here--wrecked like yourselves.  If\nyou have boats, lower them, and I'll pilot you to land.\"\n\n\"Ohone!\" groaned Mrs Lynch, in solemn despair, as she tried to see the\nspeaker, whom darkness rendered almost invisible.  \"An unbeknown island,\nuninhabited by nobody.  Boys, we are done for intirely.  Didn't I say\nthis would be the end of it, when we made up our minds to go to say?\"\n\nNo one seemed inclined just then to dispute the prophetic reminiscences\nof the widow, for the order had been given to get ready one of the\nboats.  Turning to the emigrants, who were now clustering on the fore\npart of the vessel, Malines, condescending to adopt a more respectful\ntone, addressed them as follows:--\n\n\"Now, let me tell you, one and all, that your voyage has come to an end\nsooner than I expected.  Our ship is wrecked, but we're out of danger,\nand must go ashore an' live as best we can, or die if we can't live.\nWhere we are, I don't know, and don't care, for it don't much matter.\nIt's an island, it seems, and three people who have been wrecked before\nus are all its population.  As it is too dark to go ashore comfortably\nto-night, I would advise you to go below again, an' turn in till\ndaylight.  You may make your minds easy, for there's no fear of our\ngoing to the bottom _now_.\"\n\n\"Sure, an' you're right there,\" murmured Teddy Malone, \"for aren't we at\nthe bottom already?\"\n\n\"You may all do as you please, however,\" continued the mate, after a\nlow-toned remark from one of the crew, \"for my command has come to an\nend with the loss of the ship.\"\n\nWhen the mate ceased speaking, there was a brief pause, for the\nunfortunate emigrants had been so long accustomed to conform to the\nstrict discipline of the ship that they felt like sheep suddenly\ndeprived of a shepherd, or soldiers bereft of their officers when thus\nleft to think for themselves.  Then the self-sufficient and officious\namong them began to give advice, and to dispute noisily as to what they\nshould do, so that in a few minutes their voices, mingling with the gale\nand the cries of terrified children, caused such a din that the strong\nspirit of the widow Lynch was stirred within her, inducing her to raise\nher masculine voice in a shout that silenced nearly all the rest.\n\n\"That's right, mother,\" cried young Malone, \"howld yer tongues, boys,\nand let's hear what the widdy has to say.  Isn't it herself has got the\ngreat mind--not to mintion the body?\"\n\n\"Shut your murphy-trap, Teddy,\" retorted the widow, \"an' here's what\nI've got to say.  We must have only wan man to guide us if we are to get\non at all.  Too many cooks, ye knows well enough, is sure to spile the\nbroth.  Let Joe Binney speak, and the rest of 'ee howld yer tongues, if\nye can.\"\n\nThus invited, modest Joe gave it as his opinion that the emigrants could\nnot do better than follow the advice of Muster Malines--go below, turn\nin, and wait till daylight.  He added further that he would count it a\nfavour if Muster Malines would continue in command of the party, at\nleast till they all got ashore.\n\nThis little compliment to the man whom he had so recently defied had a\nsoftening influence on the mate, and the proposal was well received by\nthe people, who, even during the few minutes of anarchy which had\nprevailed, were led to appreciate the value of order and government.\n\n\"You are right, Binney,\" said the mate.  \"I would advise you all, good\npeople, to go below and rest as well as you can, while I, and those who\nchoose to act under me, will go ashore and make the best possible\narrangements for your landing in the morning.\"\n\n\"Now, why don't ye do what ye'er towld at wanst?\" cried Mrs Lynch, who\nhad evidently made up her mind that the reins of government were not to\nbe entirely given up to the mate.  \"It's not wishin', are ye, to get\nwetter than ye are, a'ready?  Go below, ivery wan of ye.\"\n\nLike a meek flock, the women and children obeyed the mandate, being\nabsolutely in bodily fear of the woman, while most of the men followed\nthem with a laugh, or a little chaff, according to temperament.\n\nBefore the latter had left the deck, Malines suggested that Joe Binney\nand his brother David should accompany him on shore that night, to\nrepresent the emigrants, as it were, and assist him in the proposed\narrangements.\n\n\"Besides,\" he added, \"there is just the possibility that we may fall\ninto a trap.  We know nothing about the man who has come off to us\nexcept his voice, so that it will be wise to land with some of our best\nmen armed.\"\n\nOf course the brothers had no objection to this plan, and accordingly\nthey, with the mate and four of the ship's crew--all armed with\ncutlasses and pistols--got into one of the boats and were lowered into\nthe water on the lee side of the vessel, where Dominick and Otto had\nbeen quietly awaiting the end of the foregoing discussions.\n\nIn a few minutes they reached the shore, and then Dominick shook hands\nwith them, and welcomed them to the islands, \"which,\" he said, \"we have\nnamed `Refuge Islands.'\"\n\n\"Run up to the cave, Otto,\" he whispered, while the party was engaged in\ndrawing up the boat.  \"Stir up the fire and rouse Pina,--tell her to\nprepare to receive company.\"\n\n\"She'll be as much puzzled as if I told her to prepare to receive\ncavalry,\" muttered the boy as he ran up to the cave.\n\n\"Hallo!  Pina! rouse up, old girl,\" he shouted, bursting into the cave,\nand falling on his knees before the embers of the fire, which he soon\nblew up into a flame.  \"I say, Pina! hallo!  Pina!  Pi-i-i-i-na!\"\n\n\"Dear me, Otto, what is wrong?\" asked the sleepy voice of Pauline from\nbehind her screen.\n\n\"Wrong?\" cried her brother, \"nothing's wrong--that is, everything's\nwrong; but don't be afraid, old girl, all's right.  Dress as fast as you\ncan, and prepare for company!\"\n\n\"What _do_ you mean?\" cried the girl, by that time thoroughly aroused,\nand somewhat alarmed by Otto's words and excitement.\n\n\"Can't explain.  No time.  Get up, make yourself presentable, and come\nout of your den.\"\n\nAs he spoke Pauline lifted the curtain door of her apartment and stepped\ninto the outer cave, which was by that time all aglow with the ruddy\nblaze.\n\n\"Do you call yourself presentable?\" asked Otto, laughing; \"why your hair\nis raised like the back of a wild cat.\"\n\nIt is only right to say that the boy did not do his sister justice.  An\nold shawl thrown hastily on, and descending in confused folds around her\nslight, graceful figure, invested her with an air of classic simplicity,\nwhile her pretty face, surrounded by a wealth of dishevelled, but\nbeautiful, hair, was suggestive of something very much the reverse of a\nwild cat.\n\n\"Are you prepared, sister, for a stunning surprise?\" said Otto, quickly,\nfor he heard the approaching footsteps of the party.\n\n\"I'm prepared for anything,\" said Pauline, her lustrous eyes and her\nlittle mouth opening simultaneously, for she also heard the numerous\nfootfalls outside.\n\n\"'Tis well!\" cried Otto, starting up, and assuming a heroic attitude as\nhe waved his right hand toward the door of the cavern, \"no time to\nexplain.  Enter Dominick, with band of robbers, headed by their captain,\namid shrieking wind, forked lightning, and peals of thunder!\"\n\nAs he spoke, Pauline, despite her surprise, could scarcely refrain from\nlaughter, for Otto's words were fulfilled almost to the letter.  Amid a\nstrife of elements that caused their frail erections to tremble, the\nlittle door burst open, and Dominick, stooping low to save his head,\nentered.  He was followed by the gaunt, dark form of Malines, who, in\nrough garments and long fishermen's boots, with pistols in belt, and\ncutlass by his side, was a particularly good representative of a\nrobber-captain.  Following him came the still more gigantic Joe Binney,\nand his equally huge brother David, after which trooped in the boat's\ncrew one by one.\n\nAs each man entered he stood stock still--dumb, petrified with\nastonishment--as he gazed, saucer-eyed, at Pauline.  Bereft of speech\nand motion, she returned the gaze with interest.\n\nOh! it was a rare treat to Otto!  His little bosom heaved with delight\nas he watched the shipwrecked men enter one after another and become\npetrefactions!  Some of the sailors even dropped their lower jaws with\nwonder.\n\nDominick, who, in the bustle of action, had not thought of the surprise\nin store for his visitors, burst into a hearty fit of laughter.\n\n\"It was well got up, Otto,\" he said at last.\n\n\"No, it wasn't, Dom.  I do assure you it was not got up at all, but came\nabout in the most natural manner.\"\n\n\"Well, got up or not,\" returned Dominick, \"here you are, friends, in\nwhat we have styled our golden cave, and this is my sister Pauline--\nallow me to introduce you, Pina, to part of a shipwrecked crew.\"\n\nThe youth's laughter, and the introduction which followed, seemed to\ndisenchant the mariners, who, recovering self-possession with a deep\nsigh, became sheepish in bearing, and seemed inclined to beat a retreat,\nbut our heroine quickly put them at their ease.  With a natural tact and\ngrace of manner which had the appearance of, but was not meant for,\ndignity, she advanced and offered her little hand to Malines, who seemed\nto fear that he might crush it unintentionally, so slight was the shake\nhe gave it.\n\n\"You are heartily welcome to our cavern,\" she said.  \"I'm _so_ grieved\nto hear that you have been wrecked.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it, Miss.  Not worth speaking of, I assure you; we're\nquite used to it,\" replied Malines, not knowing very well what he said.\n\nThe ice, however, was broken.  From this point all went on, as Otto\nsaid, swimmingly.  The mate began to relate the circumstances of the\nrecent wreck, while Pauline and Otto spread the remains of their supper\nbefore the men, and set about roasting the fowls that had been intended\nfor the morrow's breakfast.\n\nBefore long the gale began to abate, and the sailors went out with\nDominick, to select a spot on which the emigrants might encamp, being\naided in this work by a struggling and fitful moonlight.  After that\nMalines went back with his party to the ship, and Dominick returned with\nOtto to court slumber in the golden cave.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX.\n\nSHIPWRECKED EMIGRANTS AND HORRIFIED CONSPIRATORS.\n\nThe scene which presented itself on the morning after the storm is not\neasily described, and the change to the trio who had up to that time\nlived so peacefully on Refuge Islands' Reef was so great that they found\nit difficult at first to believe it was other than a dream.\n\nOn awaking, indeed, Otto saluted his brother with the exclamation--\n\n\"O Dom, I've had such a comical dream!\"\n\n\"Indeed, my boy,\" said Dominick, \"I fear it was no dream, but a\nreality.\"\n\nAt this Otto suddenly sprang up, and ran out to relieve his mind on the\npoint.  A few seconds sufficed.  On clearing the bushes he beheld the\nnew wreck lying not far from the old one, and saw from the crowds of\npeople who were being put into the boats that the emigrant ship had been\nno mere creature of his imagination.  It was evident that the boat which\nhad just quitted the vessel's side contained the first band of\nemigrants, for the only people yet landed were a few men, who busied\nthemselves in putting up a rude shelter for the women and children, and\nin kindling fires for the preparation of breakfast on a little mound\nbetween two and three hundred yards from the golden cave.\n\nBy that time the storm had blown itself out, and the rising sun was\nmounting into a cloudless blue sky, and covering the sea with dazzling\nripples, which looked as if the very water were laughing with joy at the\nsudden change from darkness and fury to light and peace.\n\nConspicuous among those who worked on shore was the gigantic form of Joe\nBinney.  Considering him an old acquaintance.  Otto ran up to him and\nshook hands.\n\n\"How many emigrants are there of you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Three hundred, more or less, master, but I ain't rightly sure; there's\nsuch a many that it's difficult to count 'em when they are all a-movin'\nto and fro.\"\n\n\"Here, Joe, catch hold o' this post, an' keep it steady till I make it\nfast,\" said Hugh Morris, the seaman who has been described as one of the\nmost turbulent among the men.\n\nWhile Joe assisted in the erection of the canvas booth or shelter, he\ngave Otto a good deal of information regarding the vessel, the\nemigrants, the crew, and the misunderstandings which had occurred\nprevious to the captain's death.\n\n\"It's well for one man that we've bin wrecked, anyhow,\" remarked Morris,\nstepping back with an artistic air to survey his handiwork.\n\n\"You mean the young doctor,\" said Joe.\n\n\"That's who I mean,\" returned Morris.  \"Doctor John Marsh.  He's the\nonly man in the ship that's worth his salt, but I fear he's a doomed\nman.\"\n\n\"I hope not, Hugh, though there _are_ one or two men on board worth more\nthan their salt,\" said Joe, with a peculiar smile, as he returned to the\ncare of a large kettle of beans, from which the sailor had called him.\n\nOn Otto inquiring what was the matter with the doctor, Joe Binney\nexplained--\n\n\"He's been ill a'most since we left England, owin' to a fall he had in\ntryin' to save one o' the child'n as was tumblin' down the after-hatch.\nHe saved the child, but broke one or two of his own ribs, an' the broken\nends must have damaged his lungs, for, ever since, he's bin spittin'\nblood an' wearin' away, till we can hardly believe he's the same stout,\nhearty, active young feller that came aboord at Gravesend.  Spite of his\nhurt he's bin goin' among us quite cheerful-like, doin' the best he\ncould for the sick; but as Morris says, he looks like a doomed man.\nP'r'aps gittin' ashore may do him good.  You see, bein' the only doctor\nin the ship, he couldn't attend to hisself as well as might be, mayhap.\"\n\nWhile Joe and Otto were conversing, the first boat load of emigrants\nlanded, consisting chiefly of women and children.  Dr Marsh was also\namong them, in order that, as he said with quiet pleasantry, he might\nattend to the sanitary arrangements of the camp in the new land, though\nall who saw him quit the wreck were under the sorrowful impression that\nthe new land would prove to be in his case a last resting-place.\n\nThere was something peculiarly attractive in the manly, handsome face of\nthis young disciple of Aesculapius, worn as it was by long sickness and\nsuffering, and Otto fell in love with him at first sight.\n\nThere can be no doubt that some human beings are so constituted as to\npowerfully attract others by their mere physical conformation and\nexpression, without reference to character or conduct,--indeed, before\ncharacter or conduct can possibly be known.  And when this peculiar\nconformation and expression is coupled with delicacy of health, and\nobvious suffering, the attractive influence becomes irresistible.  Let\nus thank God that such is the case.  Blind, unreasoning affection is a\ngrand foundation on which to build a mighty superstructure of good\noffices, kindly acts, and tender feelings, mingled, it may be, with\nloving forbearance, and occasional suffering, which shall be good to the\nsouls of the lover, as well as the loved one.\n\nAnyhow, when Otto saw Dr Marsh helped, almost lifted, out of the boat;\nobserved him give a pitiful little smile, and heard him utter some mild\npleasantry to those who assisted him, he experienced a gush of feeling\nsuch as had never before inflated his reckless little bosom, and\nsomething like water--to his great astonishment--caused interference\nwith his vision.\n\nRunning forward just as the widow Lynch was officiously thrusting her\nwarm-hearted attentions on the invalid, he accosted the doctor, and\noffered to escort him to the golden cave.\n\nAnd we may here inform the reader that the involuntary affection of our\nlittle hero met with a suitable return, for Dr Marsh also fell in love\nwith Otto at first sight.  His feelings, however, were strongly mingled\nwith surprise.\n\n\"My boy,\" he said, with painfully wide-open eyes, \"from what part of the\nsky have _you_ dropt?\"\n\n\"Well, not being a falling star or a rocket-stick, I cannot claim such\nhigh descent,--but hasn't the mate told you about us?\" returned Otto.\n\nHere widow Lynch broke in with:\n\n\"Towld him about you?  Av course he hasn't.  He don't throuble his hid\nto tell much to any wan; an', sure, wasn't the doctor slaapin' whin he\nreturned aboord i' the night, an' wasn't I nursin' of 'im, and d'ee\nthink any wan could git at 'im widout my lave?\"\n\nOtto thought that certainly no one could easily accomplish that feat,\nand was about to say so, when Dr Marsh said remonstratively--\n\n\"Now, my dear widow Lynch, do leave me to the care of this new friend,\nwho, I am sure, is quite able to assist me, and do you go and look after\nthese poor women and children.  They are quite helpless without your\naid.  Look! your favourite Brown-eyes will be in the water if you don't\nrun.\"\n\nThe child of a poor widow, which had been styled Brown-eyes by the\ndoctor because of its gorgeous optics, was indeed on the point of taking\nan involuntary bath as he spoke.  Mrs Lynch, seeing the danger, rushed\ntumultuously to the rescue, leaving the doctor to Otto's care.\n\n\"Don't let me lean too heavily on you,\" he said, looking down; \"I'm\nbig-boned, you see, and long-legged, though rather thin.\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" said Otto, looking up, \"you're as light as a feather, and I'm as\nstrong as a horse,--a little horse, at least.  You'd better not go to\nthe camp yet, they are not ready for you, and that sweet little delicate\ncreature you call widow Lynch is quite able to manage them all.  Come up\nwith me to the cave.  But has nobody said a word about _us_?\"\n\n\"Not a soul.  As the widow told you, I was asleep when the mate returned\nto the wreck.  Indeed, it is not very long since I awoke.  I did hear\nsome mention in passing of a few people being on the island, but I\nthought they referred to savages.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they were not far wrong,\" said Otto, with a laugh.  \"I do feel\npretty savage sometimes, and Dominick is awful when he is roused; but we\ncan't count Pauline among the savages.\"\n\n\"Dominick!  Pauline!\" exclaimed the doctor.  \"My good fellow, explain\nyourself, and let us sit down on this bank while you do so.  I'm so\nstupidly weak that walking only a few yards knocks me up.\"\n\n\"Well, only two or three yards further will bring you to our cave, which\nis just beyond that cluster of bushes, but it may be as well to\nenlighten you a little before introducing you.\"\n\nIn a few rapid sentences Otto explained their circumstances, and how\nthey came to be there.  He told his brief tale in sympathetic ears.\n\n\"And your own name,\" asked the doctor, \"is--?\"\n\n\"Otto Rigonda.\"\n\n\"Well, Otto, my boy, you and I shall be friends; I know it--I feel it.\"\n\n\"And I'm _sure_ of it,\" responded the enthusiastic boy, grasping the\nhand of the invalid, and shaking it almost too warmly.  \"But come, I\nwant to present you to my sister.  Dominick is already among the\nemigrants, for I saw him leave the cave and go down to the camp when you\nwere disputing with that female grampus.\"\n\n\"Come, don't begin our friendship by speaking disrespectfully of one of\nmy best friends,\" said the doctor, rising; \"but for widow Lynch's tender\nnursing I don't think I should be here now.\"\n\n\"I'll respect and reverence her henceforth and for ever,\" said Otto.\n\"But here we are--this is the golden cave.  Now you'll have to stoop,\nbecause our door was made for short men like me--and for humble long\nones like my brother.\"\n\n\"I'll try to be a humble long one,\" said the doctor as he stooped and\nfollowed Otto into the cave.\n\nPauline was on her knees in front of the fire, with her back to the\ndoor, as they entered.  She was stooping low and blowing at the flames\nvigorously.\n\n\"O Otto!\" she exclaimed, without looking round, \"this fire will break my\nheart.  It _won't_ light!\"\n\n\"More company, Pina,\" said her brother.\n\nPauline sprang up and turned round with flushed countenance and\ndisordered hair; and again Otto had the ineffable delight of seeing\nhuman beings suddenly reduced to that condition which is variously\ndescribed as being \"stunned,\" \"thunderstruck,\" \"petrified,\" and \"struck\nall of a heap\" with surprise.\n\nPauline was the first to recover self-possession.\n\n\"Really, Otto, it is too bad of you to take one by surprise so.  Excuse\nme, sir,--no doubt you are one of the unfortunates who have been\nwrecked.  I have much pleasure in offering you the hospitality of our\nhumble home!\"\n\nPauline spoke at first half jestingly, but when she looked full at the\nthin, worn countenance of the youth who stood speechless before her, she\nforgot surprise and everything else in a feeling of pity.\n\n\"But you have been ill,\" she continued, sympathetically; \"this wreck\nmust have--pray sit down.\"\n\nShe placed a little stool for her visitor beside the fire.\n\nIf Dr John Marsh had spoken the words that sprang to his lips he would\nhave begun with \"Angelic creature,\" but he suppressed his feelings and\nonly stammered--\n\n\"Your b-brother, Miss Rigonda, must have a taste for taking people by\nsurprise, for he did not tell me that--that--I--I mean he did not\nprepare me for--for--you are right.  I think I had better sit down, for\nI have, as you perceive, been very ill, and am rather weak, and--and in\nthe circumstances such an unexpected--a--\"\n\nAt this critical moment Dominick fortunately entered the cave, and\nrescued the doctor from the quicksand, in which he was floundering.\n\n\"Oh! you must be the very man I want,\" he said, grasping his visitor by\nthe hand.\n\n\"That is strange,\" returned the doctor, with a languid smile, \"seeing\nthat you have never met me before.\"\n\n\"True, my good sir; nevertheless I may venture to say that I know you\nwell, for there's a termagant of an Irish woman down at the camp going\nabout wringing her hands, shouting out your good qualities in the most\npathetic tones, and giving nobody a moment's peace because she does not\nknow what has become of you.  Having a suspicion that my brother must\nhave found you and brought you here, I came to see.  But pray, may I ask\nyour name, for the Irish woman only describes you as `Doctor, dear!'\"\n\n\"Allow me to introduce him,\" cried Otto, \"as an old friend of mine--Dr\nMarsh.\"\n\nDominick looked at his brother in surprise.\n\n\"Otto is right,\" said the doctor, with a laugh, \"at least if feeling may\nbe permitted to do duty for time in gauging the friendship.\"\n\n\"Well, Dr Marsh, we are happy to make your acquaintance, despite the\nsadness of the circumstances,\" said Dominick, \"and will do all we can\nfor you and your friends; meanwhile, may I ask you to come to the camp\nand relieve the mind of your worshipper, for I can scarcely call her\nless.\"\n\nPoor Dr Marsh, feeling greatly exhausted by excitement as much as by\nexertion, was on the point of excusing himself and begging his host to\nfetch the widow up to the cave, when he was saved the trouble by the\nwidow herself, whose voice was just then heard outside.\n\n\"What's that yer sayin', Joe?\" she exclaimed in a remonstrative tone,\n\"ye seed 'im go into that rabbit-hole?  Never!  Don't tell me!  Arrah\nit's on his hands an knees he'd have to do it.\"\n\nThe voice which replied was pitched in a much deeper and softer key, but\nit was heard distinctly to say, \"Ay, widdy Lynch, that's the door I seed\nhim an' a boy go through; so ye'd better rap at it an' inquire.\"\n\n\"Faix, an' that's jist what I'll do, though I don't half belave ye.\"\n\nShe was about to apply her large red knuckles to the door in question\nwhen her intention was frustrated and her doubts were scattered by the\ndoor opening and Dominick presenting himself.\n\n\"Come in, Mrs Lynch, come in.  Your doctor is here, alive and well.\"\n\n\"Well, is it--ah!  I wish he was!  Are ye there, darlin'?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" came from within, in a laughing voice.  \"Here I am, Mrs\nLynch, all right and comfortable.  Come in.\"\n\nBeing excessively tall, the widow was obliged, like others, to stoop to\nenter; but being also excessively broad, she only got her head and\nshoulders through the doorway, and then, unlike others, she stuck fast.\nBy dint, however, of a good pull from Dominick and a gentle push from\nJoe, she was got inside without quite carrying away the structure which\nthe gale of the preceding night had spared.\n\n\"Och! 'tis a quare place intirely, and there is some disadvantage in\nbein' big--thank ye kindly, sir--but on the whole--\"\n\nShe got no further, for at that moment her sharp little grey eyes fell\non Pauline, and once again Otto's heart was stirred to its profoundest\ndepths by the expressive glare that ensued.  Indeed, Dominick and Marsh\nwere equally affected, and could not help laughing.\n\n\"Ha! ye may laugh,\" said the widow, with profound solemnity, \"but if\nit's not dramin' I am, what Father Macgrath says about ghosts is true,\nand--\"\n\n\"I hope you don't take _me_ for a ghost, Mrs Lynch,\" said Pauline,\nstepping forward with a kindly smile and holding out her hand.\n\n\"No, cushla!  I don't,\" returned the widow, accepting the hand tenderly.\n\"Sure it's more like a ghost the doctor is, in spite of his larfin'.\nBut wonders 'll niver cease.  I'll lave 'im wid an aisy mind, for he's\nin good hands.  Now, Joe, clear out o' the door, like a good man, an'\nlet me through.  They'll be wantin' me at the camp.  A good haul, Joe,\nI'm tough; no fear o' me comin' to pieces.  Och! but it's a poor cabin.\nAn Irish pig wouldn't thank ye for it.\"\n\nMurmuring similar uncomplimentary remarks, mingled with expressions of\nsurprise, the voice of the woman gradually died away, and the people in\nthe golden cave were left to discuss their situation and form hasty\nplans for the present emergency.\n\nAt first, of course, they could do little else than make each other\npartially acquainted with the circumstances which had so strangely\nthrown them together, but Dominick soon put an end to this desultory\ntalk.\n\n\"You see, it will take all our time,\" he said, \"between this and sunset\nto get the emigrants comfortably under canvas, or some sort of shelter.\"\n\n\"True,\" assented Dr Marsh, \"and it would never do with so many women\nand children, some of whom are on the sick list, to leave them to the\nrisk of exposure to another storm like that which has just passed.  Is\nyour island subject to such?\"\n\n\"By no means,\" answered Dominick.  \"It has a splendid climate.  This\ngale is quite exceptional.  Nevertheless, we cannot tell when the next\nmay burst on us.  Come, Otto, you and I will go down to the camp.  Now,\nDr Marsh, you must remain here.  I can see, without being told, that\nyou are quite unfit to help us.  I know that it is hard to be condemned\nto inaction when all around are busy, but reflect how many patients you\nhave solemnly warned that their recovery would depend on implicit\nobedience to the doctor's orders!  Divide yourself in two, now, and, as\na doctor, give yourself strict orders to remain quiet.\"\n\n\"H'm!  Gladly would I divide myself,\" was the doctor's reply, \"if while\nI left the patient half to act the invalid, I could take the impatient\nhalf down to the camp to aid you.  But I submit.  The days of my once\nboasted strength are gone.  I feel more helpless than a mouse.\"\n\nThere was something quite pitiful in the half-humorous look, and the\nweary sigh, with which the poor youth concluded his remarks, and Otto\nwas so touched that he suddenly suggested the propriety of his staying\nbehind and taking care of him.\n\n\"Why, you conceited creature,\" cried Dominick, \"of what use could _you_\nbe?  Besides, don't you think that Pina is a sufficiently good nurse?\"\n\nOtto humbly admitted that she was.\n\nDr Marsh, glancing at her pretty face, on which at the moment there\nbeamed an expression of deep sympathy, also admitted that she was; but,\nbeing a man of comparatively few words, he said nothing.\n\nIt was a busy day for Dominick and his brother.  Not only had they to\ncounsel and advise with the unfortunate emigrants as to the best\nposition for the temporary encampment, with reference to wood and water,\nas well as to assist with their own hands in the erection of tents made\nof torn sails and huts and booths composed of broken planks and reeds,\nbut they had to answer innumerable questions from the inquisitive as to\ntheir own history, from the anxious as to the probabilities of\ndeliverance, from the practical as to the resources of the islands, and\nfrom the idiotic as to everything in general and nothing in particular.\nIn addition to which they had to encourage the timid, to correct the\nmistaken, and to remonstrate with or resist the obstinate; also to romp\na little with the children as they recovered their spirits, quiet the\nbabies as they recovered their powers of lung, and do a little amateur\ndoctoring for the sick in the absence of the medical man.\n\nIn all these varied occupations they were much aided by the widow Lynch,\nwho, instead of proving to be, as they had expected, a troublesome\ntermagant, turned out to be a soft-hearted, kindly, enthusiastic,\nsympathetic woman, with a highly uneducated, unbalanced mind, a\npowerfully constituted and masculine frame, and \"a will of her own.\"  In\nthis last particular she did not differ much from the rest of the human\nspecies, but she was afflicted with an unusually strong desire to assert\nit.\n\nVery like Mrs Lynch in the matters of kindly soft-heartedness and\nsympathy was Mrs Welsh--a poor, gentle, delicate Englishwoman, the wife\nof a great hulking cross-grained fellow named Abel, who was a carpenter\nby trade and an idler by preference.  Mrs Welsh was particularly good\nas a sick-nurse and a cook, in which capacities she made herself\nextremely useful.\n\nAbout midday, Mrs Welsh having prepared a glorious though simple meal\nfor her section of the emigrant band, and the other sections having been\nministered to more or less successfully by their more or less capable\ncooks, Dominick and Otto went up to the golden cave to dinner, which\nthey well knew the faithful Pauline would have ready waiting for them.\n\n\"What a day we have had, to be sure!\" said Dominick as they walked\nalong; \"and I'm as hungry as a kangaroo.\"\n\nWithout noticing the unreasonableness of supposing that long-legged\ncreature to be the hungriest of animals, Otto declared that he was in\nthe same condition, \"if not more so.\"\n\nOn opening the door they were checked by the expression of Pauline's\nface, the speaking eyes of which, and the silent mouth, were\nconcentrated into an unmistakable \"hush!\"--which was emphasised by a\nsignificant forefinger.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" whispered Dominick, anxiously.\n\n\"Sleeping,\" murmured Pauline--she was too good a nurse to whisper--\npointing to the invalid, who, overcome with the night's exposure and the\nmorning's excitement, had fallen into a profound slumber on Otto's\nhumble couch.\n\nThis was a rather severe and unexpected trial to Otto, who had come up\nto the cave brimming over with camp news for Pauline's benefit.  He felt\nthat it was next to impossible to relate in a whisper all the doings and\nsayings, comical and otherwise, that he had seen and heard that day.  To\neat his dinner and say nothing seemed equally impossible.  To awaken the\nwearied sleeper was out of the question.  However, there was nothing for\nit but to address himself to the suppression of his feelings.  Probably\nit was good for him to be thus self-disciplined; certainly it was\npainful.\n\nHe suffered chiefly at the top of the nose--inside behind his eyes--that\nbeing the part of the safety-valve where bursts of laughter were\nchecked; and more than once, while engaged in a whispering commentary on\nthe amiable widow Lynch, the convulsions within bade fair to blow the\nnasal organ off his face altogether.  Laughter is catching.  Pauline and\nDominick, ere long, began to wish that Otto would hold his tongue.  At\nlast, some eccentricity of Joe Binney, or his brother, or Mrs Lynch, we\nforget which, raised the pressure to such a pitch that the safety-valves\nof all three became ineffective.  They all exploded in unison, and poor\nMarsh was brought to consciousness, surprise, and a sitting posture at\nthe same instant.\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" he said, rather sheepishly, \"that I've been sleeping.\"\n\n\"You have, doctor, and a right good sleep you've had,\" said Dominick,\nrising and placing a stool for the invalid.  \"We ought to apologise for\ndisturbing you; but come, sit down and dine.  You must be hungry by this\ntime.\"\n\n\"Indeed I am.  The land air seems to have had a powerful effect on me\nalready.\"\n\n\"Truly it must,\" remarked Pauline, \"else you could not have fallen\nasleep in the very middle of my glowing description of our island home.\"\n\n\"Did I really do that?\" said the doctor, with an air of self-reproach.\n\n\"Indeed you did; but in the circumstances you are to be excused.\"\n\n\"And I hope,\" added Dominick, \"that you'll have many a good sleep in our\ngolden cave.\"\n\n\"Golden cave, indeed,\" echoed the invalid, in thought, for his mind was\ntoo much taken up just then with Pauline to find vent in speech.  \"A\ngolden cave it will be to me for evermore!\"\n\nIt is of no use mincing the matter; Dr John Marsh, after being regarded\nby his friends at home as hopelessly unimpressible--in short, an\nabsolute woman-hater--had found his fate on a desolate isle of the\nSouthern seas, he had fallen--nay, let us be just--had jumped over head\nand ears in love with Pauline Rigonda!  Dr Marsh was no sentimental\ndie-away noodle who, half-ashamed, half-proud of his condition, displays\nit to the semi-contemptuous world.  No; after disbelieving for many\nyears in the power of woman to subdue him, he suddenly and manfully gave\nin--sprang up high into the air, spiritually, and so to speak, turning a\nsharp somersault, went headlong down deep into the flood, without the\nslightest intention of ever again returning to the surface.\n\nBut of this mighty upheaval and overturning of his sentiments he\nbetrayed no symptom whatever, excepting two bright spots--one on either\ncheek--which might easily have been mistaken for the effects of\nweakness, or recent excitement, or bad health, or returning hunger.\nCalmly he set to work on the viands before him with unusual appetite,\nconversing earnestly, meanwhile, with Dominick and Otto on the gravity\nof their situation, and bestowing no more attention upon Pauline than\nwas barely consistent with good breeding, insomuch that that pretty\nyoung creature began to feel somewhat aggrieved.  Considering all the\ncare she had so recently bestowed on him, she came to the conclusion, in\nshort, that he was by no means as polite as at first she had supposed\nhim to be.\n\nBy degrees the conversation about the present began to give place to\ndiscussions as to the future, and when Dominick and Otto returned for\ntheir evening meal at sunset, bringing with them Mr Malines, the mate,\nand Joe Binney and his brother David and Hugh Morris as being\nrepresentative men of the emigrants and ship's crew, the meeting\nresolved itself into a regular debating society.  At this point Pauline\ndeserted them and went down to the camp to cultivate the acquaintance of\nthe widow Lynch, Mrs Welsh, and the other female and infantine members\nof the wrecked party.\n\n\"For my part,\" said Malines, \"I shall take one o' the boats, launch it\nin the lagoon, and go over to the big island, follow me who may, for it\nis clear that there's not room for us all on this strip of sand.\"\n\n\"I don't see that,\" objected Hugh Morris.  \"Seems to me as there's space\nenough for all of us, if we're not too greedy.\"\n\n\"That shows ye knows nothin' about land, Hugh,\" said Joe Binney.\n\"What's of it here is not only too little, but too sandy.  I votes for\nthe big island.\"\n\n\"So does I,\" said David Binney.  \"Big Island for me.\"\n\nThus, incidentally, was the large island named.\n\n\"But,\" said Hugh, still objecting, \"it won't be half so convenient to\ngit things out o' the wreck, as where we are.\"\n\n\"Pooh! that's nothing,\" said Malines.  \"It won't cost us much trouble to\ncarry all we want across a spit of sand.\"\n\nSeeing that the two men were getting angry with each other, Dominick\ninterposed by blandly stating that he knew well the capabilities of the\nspot on which they were encamped, and he was sure that such a party\nwould require more ground if they meant to settle on it.\n\n\"Well now, master,\" observed Joe, with a half-laugh, \"we don't 'zactly\nmean for to settle on it, but here we be, an' here we must be, till a\nship takes us off, an' we can't afford to starve, 'ee know, so we'll\njust plough the land an' plant our seed, an' hope for good weather an'\nheavy crops; so I says Big Island!\"\n\n\"An' so says I--Big Island for ever!\" repeated his brother David.\n\nAfter a good deal more talk and altercation this was finally agreed to,\nand the meeting dissolved itself.\n\nThat night, at the darkest hour, another meeting was held in the darkest\nspot that could be found near the camp.  It chanced, unknown to the\nmeeting, to be the burial-ground at first discovered by the Rigondas.\n\nUnwittingly, for it was very dark, Hugh Morris seated himself on one of\nthe old graves, and about thirty like-minded men gathered round him.\nLittle did they know that Otto was one of the party!  Our little hero,\nbeing sharp eyed and eared, had seen and overheard enough in the camp\nthat day to induce him to watch Morris after he left the cave, and\nfollow him to the rendezvous.\n\n\"My lads,\" said Morris, \"I've done my best to keep them to the reef, but\nthat blackguard Malines won't hear of it.  He's bent on takin' 'em all\nto the big island, so they're sure to go, and we won't get the help o'\nthe other men: but no matter; wi' blocks an' tackle we'll do it\nourselves, so we can afford to remain quiet till our opportunity comes.\nI'm quite sure the ship lays in such a position that we can get her over\nthe ledge into deep water, and so be able to draw round into the open\nsea, and then--\"\n\n\"Hurrah for the black flag and the southern seas,\" cried one of the\nparty.\n\n\"No, no, Jabez Jenkins,\" said Morris, \"we don't mean to be pirates; only\nfree rovers.\"\n\n\"Hallo! what's this?\" exclaimed another of the party.  \"A cross, I do\nbelieve! and this mound--why, it's a grave!\"\n\n\"And here's another one!\" said Jabez, in a hoarse whisper.  \"Seems to me\nwe've got into a cannibal churchyard, or--\"\n\n\"Bo-o-o-o-oo!\" groaned Otto at that moment, in the most horribly\nsepulchral tone he could command.\n\nNothing more was wanted.  With one consent the conspirators leapt up and\nfled from the dreadful spot in a frenzy of unutterable consternation.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\n\nTREATS OF BIG ISLAND--A GREAT FIGHT AND A ROYAL FAMILY.\n\n\"Dominick,\" said Otto, next morning, after having solemnly and somewhat\nmysteriously led his brother to the old burial-ground, \"would you\nbelieve me if I told you that last night, when you and the like of you\nwere sound asleep, not to say snoring, I saw some twenty or thirty men\nfly from this spot like maniacs at the howling of a ghost?\"\n\n\"No, I would not believe you,\" answered Dominick, with a bland smile.\n\n\"Would you not believe me if I told you that _I_ was the ghost and that\nHugh Morris was the ringleader of the cowards?\"\n\n\"Come, Otto, be sensible and explain.\"\n\nOtto became sensible and explained.  Thereupon Dominick became serious,\nand said \"Oho!\"  To which Otto replied \"Just so,\" after which they\nbecame meditative.  Then Dominick linked his arm in that of his little\nbrother, and, leading him off to a well-known and sequestered walk,\nentered into an earnest confabulation.\n\nWith the details of that confabulation we will not trouble the reader.\nWe will only repeat the concluding sentences.\n\n\"Well, then, Dom, it's agreed on, that we are to go on as if we knew\nnothing about this matter, and take no notice of it whatever to any\none--not even to Pina.\"\n\n\"Yes, Otto, that's it.  Of course I don't like to have any sort of\nsecret from Pina, but it would be cruel in us to fill her mind with\nalarm for no good purpose.  No--mum's the word.  Take no notice\nwhatever.  Morris may repent.  Give him the benefit of the doubt, or the\nhope.\"\n\n\"Very well, Dom, mum shall be the word.\"\n\nHaving thus for the time being disposed of a troublesome subject, the\nbrothers returned to the place where the emigrants were encamped.\n\nHere all was wild confusion and harmony.  Lest this should appear\ncontradictory, we must explain that the confusion was only physical, and\naddressed to the eye.  The emigrants, who were busy as ants, had already\ndisembarked large quantities of their goods, which were scattered about\nin various heaps between the landing-place and the encampment.  The\nharmony, on the other hand, was mental and spiritual, for as yet there\nhad been no time for conflicting interests to arise, and the people were\nall so busy that they had not leisure to disagree.\n\nBesides, the weather being splendidly bright and warm was conducive to\ngood-humour.  It will be remembered also that Hugh Morris and his\nfriends had resolved to remain quiet for the present.  Perhaps the\neffect of the ghostly visitation might have had some influence in\nrestraining their turbulent spirits.\n\nAt all events, be this as it may, when Dominick and Otto came upon the\nscene everything was progressing pleasantly.  The male emigrants were\nrunning between the beach and the camp with heavy burdens on their\nshoulders.  The females were busy washing and mending garments, which\nstood sorely in need of their attention, or tending the sick and what\nOtto styled the infantry.  The sailors were engaged, some in\ntransporting goods from the wreck to the shore, others in piloting two\nof the large boats through the reef into the lagoon, and the larger\nchildren were romping joyously in the thickets and trying to climb the\ncocoa-nut trees, while the smaller fry were rolling helplessly on the\nsands--watched, more or less, by mothers and big sisters.\n\nChief among those who piloted the large boats through the passage in the\nreef was Hugh Morris.  He took careful observations and soundings as he\nwent along, not that such were needed for the safety of the boats, but\nHugh Morris had an eye to the ultimate destiny of the ship.\n\n\"You're mighty particular, Morris,\" said Malines, with something of a\nsneer in his tone, when the former drew up his boat inside the reef\nbeside the other boat.  \"One would think you were piloting a man-of-war\nthrough instead of a little boat.\"\n\n\"What I was doin' is none o' your business, Malines,\" returned Hugh,\nsternly.  \"Your command ceased when you lost your ship, and I ain't\nagoin' to obey your orders; no, nor take any of your cheek.\"\n\n\"The emigrants chose to accept me as their commander, at least for the\npresent,\" retorted Malines, fiercely.\n\nTo this Hugh replied, with a laugh of scorn, that the emigrants might\nmake a commander of the ship's monkey for all that he cared, the\nemigrants were not _his_ masters, and he would do exactly as he pleased.\n\nAs a number of his followers echoed the scornful laugh, Malines felt\nthat he had not the power to carry things with a high hand.\n\n\"Well, well,\" he returned, in a tone of quiet indifference, \"we shall\nsee.  It is quite clear to every one with a grain of sense that people\ncan't live comfortably under two masters; the people will have to decide\nthat matter for themselves before long.\"\n\n\"Ay, that will they, master,\" remarked Joe Binney, in a low but\nsignificant voice.  \"Seems to me, however, that as we're all agreed\nabout goin' over to Big Island, we'd better go about it an' leave\ndisputation till afterwards.\"\n\nAgreeing to this in silence, the men set about loading the boats for the\nfirst trip.\n\nDominick and Otto, standing on the beach, had witnessed this\naltercation.\n\n\"The seeds of much dissension and future trouble are there,\" remarked\nthe former.\n\n\"Unless we prevent the growth of the seed,\" said Otto.\n\n\"True, but how that is to be done does not appear obvious at present.\nThese men have strong wills and powerful frames, and each has a large\nfollowing, I can see that.  We must hope that among the emigrants there\nmay be good and strong men enough to keep the crew in check.\"\n\n\"Luckily two of the biggest and stoutest are also the most sensible,\"\nsaid Otto.\n\n\"You mean the brothers Binney?\"\n\n\"Yes, Dom.  They're first-rate men, don't you think so?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly; but very ignorant, and evidently unaccustomed to lead or\ncommand men.\"\n\n\"What a pity,\" exclaimed the boy, with a flush of sudden inspiration,\n\"that we couldn't make you king of the island!  You're nearly as strong\nas the best of them, and much cleverer.\"\n\nDominick received this compliment with a laugh and a shake of the head.\n\n\"No, my boy; I am not nearly as strong as Malines or Morris, or the\nBinneys.  Besides, you forget that `the race is not always to the swift,\nnor the battle to the strong,' and as to cleverness, that does not\nconsist in a superior education or a head crammed full of knowledge, but\nin the right and ready application of knowledge.  No; I have no ambition\nto be a king.  But it won't do for us to stand here talking, else we\nshall be set down as idlers.  Come, let us lend a helping hand.\"\n\nWhile the men were busy at the boats on the lagoon side of the reef,\nPauline was winning golden opinions among the women at the camp by the\nhearty, unaffected way in which she went about making herself generally\nuseful.  O blessed simplicity, how adorable art thou in man and woman!\nSelf-forgetfulness was a salient point in Pauline's character, and,\nbeing conjoined with strong powers of sympathy, active good-will to man\nand beast, and more than the average of intellectual capacity, with an\nunder-current of rippling fun, the girl's influence quickly made itself\nfelt.\n\nMrs Lynch said she was a jewel, and that was extraordinary praise from\nthe strapping widow, who seldom complimented her sex, whatever she may\nhave felt.  Mrs Welsh said she was a \"dear, pritty creetur',\" and\nlaughter-loving little Mrs Nobbs, the wife of a jovial harum-scarum\nblacksmith, pronounced her a \"perfect darling.\"  As for the children,\nafter one hour's acquaintance they adored her, and would have \"bored her\nto death\" had that been possible.  What the men thought of her we cannot\ntell, for they spake not, but furtively stared at her in a sort of\nreverential amazement, and some of them, in a state of mild enthusiasm,\ngave murmured utterance to the sentence quoted above, \"Blessed\nsimplicity!\" for Pauline Rigonda was, at first, utterly unaware of the\nsensation she created.\n\nWhen the two boats were loaded down to the gunwales, a select party of\nmen embarked and rowed them over the calm lagoon to Big Island.  Of\ncourse they were well armed, for no one could tell what they might meet\nwith there.  Dominick and Otto were of the party, and, being regarded in\nsome measure as owners of the soil, the former was tacitly recognised as\nleader on this their first visit.\n\nThe distance they had to row was not more than a quarter of a mile, so\nthe lagoon was soon crossed.  The spot at which they landed was a\nbeautiful little bay with bush-topped cliffs on one side, a thicket of\nluxuriant plants on the other, and palm groves rising to a moderate\nheight behind.  The little beach on which they ran the boats was of pure\nwhite sand, which induced one of them to name it Silver Bay.\n\nJumping out, Dominick, with a dozen armed men, advanced into the bushes\nwith caution.\n\n\"Nothing to be seen here of either friends or foes,\" he said, halting.\n\"I felt sure that we should find no one, and it is of no use taking so\nmany of you from work; therefore, lads, I would advise your returning to\nthe boats and going to work at once.  My little brother and I will\nascend to the top of the cliff there, from which we will be able to see\nall the neighbouring country, and give you timely warning should any\nnatives appear.  Pile your rifles on the beach, so as to have them\nhandy; but you've nothing to fear.\"\n\nIn a few minutes Dominick and his brother, each carrying a rifle and\ncutlass supplied by the wrecked party, had mounted to the top of the\nneighbouring cliff, while the men returned to aid in unloading the\nboats.\n\n\"What a splendid island!\" exclaimed Otto, with intense delight, as, from\nthe lofty outlook, they gazed down upon a scene of the richest beauty.\nFrom their position on the reef they had hitherto seen the island\nthrough the softening atmosphere of distance, like a rounded mass of\nverdure; but in this case distance had _not_ \"lent enchantment to the\nview,\" for, now that they beheld it spread in all its luxuriance at\ntheir feet, like a verdant gem resting on the breast of ocean, it\nappeared infinitely more beautiful.  Not only was the mind charmed by\nthe varied details of grove and bay, thicket and grotto, but the eye was\nattracted irresistibly to the magnificent trees and shrubs which stood\nprominent in their individuality--such as the light and elegant\naito-tree; the stately apape, with its branchless trunk and light crown\nof pale green leaves, resembling those of the English ash; the splendid\ntamanu, an evergreen, with its laurel-shaped leaves; the imposing\nhutu-tree, with foliage resembling the magnolia and its large white\nflowers, the petals of which are edged with bright pink;--these and many\nothers, with the feathery palm and several kinds of mimosa lining the\nseashore, presented a display of form and colour such as the brothers\nhad not up to that time even dreamed of.\n\nWhile Otto gazed in silent wonder and admiration, he was surprised to\nhear Dominick give vent to a sigh, and shake his head.\n\n\"Dom!\" he said, remonstratively, \"what do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"I mean that the place is such a paradise that the emigrants won't want\nto leave it, and that will interfere with a little plan which had begun\nto form itself in my brain of late.  I had been thinking that among so\nmany tradesmen I should find men to help me to break up the wreck, and,\nout of the materials, to build a small vessel, with which to leave the\nisland--for, to tell you the truth, Otto, I have begun to fear that this\nplace lies so far out of the track of ships that we may be left on it\nfor many years like the mutineers of Pitcairn Island.\"\n\n\"Humph!  I'm sorry you're growing tired of it already,\" said Otto; \"I\nthought you had more o' the spirit of Robinson Crusoe in you, Dom, and I\nnever heard of the mutineers of Pitcairn Island; but if--\"\n\n\"What! did you never hear of the mutineers of the _Bounty_?\"\n\n\"Never.  My education, you know, has been neglected.\"\n\n\"Then I'll tell you the story some time or other.  It's too long to\nbegin just now, but it beats that of your favourite Robinson out of\nsight in my opinion.\"\n\nOtto shook his head in grave unbelief.  \"That,\" he said, \"is impossible.\nBut as to this island proving so attractive, don't you think that such\nfellows as Hugh Morris and Malines will take care to prevent it becoming\ntoo much of a paradise?\"\n\nDominick laughingly admitted that there was something in that--and he\nwas right.  There was even more in that than he had imagined, for the\nparty had not been a week in their new home when they began to differ as\nto the division of the island.  That old, old story of mighty men\ndesiring to take possession of the land and push their weaker brethren\nto the wall soon began to be re-enacted on this gem of the ocean, and\nbade fair to convert the paradise--like the celebrated Monte Carlo--into\na magnificent pandemonium.\n\nAt one of their stormy meetings, of which the settlers had many, the\nbrothers Binney and Dominick were present.  It was held on the shores of\nSilver Bay, where the first boat-loads had been discharged, and around\nwhich quite a village of rude huts had sprung up like mushrooms.  From\nthose disputatious assemblies most of the women absented themselves, but\nthe widow Lynch always remained, holding herself in reserve for any\nemergency, for she was well aware that her opinion carried much weight\nwith many of the party.\n\n\"We're a rough lot, and would need tight handlin',\" whispered the little\nman named Redding to Joe Binney, who sat on a bank beside him.\n\n\"The handlin' will be tight enough before long,\" returned Joe, with a\ndecided little nod.  \"Listen, the worst o' the lot's agoin' to spout.\"\n\nThis last remark had reference to Malines, who had just risen to reply\nto a fiery little man named Buxley, a tailor by trade, who was possessed\nnot only of good reasoning power but great animal courage, as he had\nproved on more than one occasion on the voyage out.\n\n\"Friends,\" said the mate, \"it's all very well for Buxley to talk about\nfair play, and equal rights, etcetera, but, I ask, would it be fair play\nto give each of us an equal portion of land, when it's quite clear that\nsome--like Joe Binney there--could cultivate twice as much as his share,\nwhile a creature like Buxley--\"\n\n\"No more a creature than yourself!\" shouted the little tailor.\n\n\"Could only work up half his lot--if even so much,\" continued the mate,\nregardless of the interruption.\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" from those who sympathised with Malines.\n\n\"An' what could _you_ do with land?\" demanded Buxley in a tone of scorn,\n\"a man that's ploughed nothing but salt water all his life.\"\n\nThis was greeted with a laugh and \"That's so.\"  \"He's only sowed wild\noats as yet.\"  \"Pitch into him, Buckie.\"\n\nMalines was fast losing temper under the little man's caustic remarks,\nbut succeeded in restraining himself, and went on:--\n\n\"It's quite plain that the island is too small to let every man have an\nequal bit of land, so I propose that it should be divided among those\nwho have strength and knowledge to work it, and--\"\n\n\"_You_ ain't one o' them,\" shouted the irate tailor.\n\n\"Come, come, Buxley--let him speak,\" said Joe Binney, \"fair play, ye\nknow.  That's what you sticks up for, ain't it?  Let 'im speak.\"\n\n\"Anyhow,\" continued Malines, sharply, \"_I_ mean to keep the bit o'\nground I've staked off whether you like it or no--\"\n\n\"An' so do I,\" cried Welsh, who was what may be styled a growly man.\n\n\"Sure, an' so does myself,\" said Teddy Malone, \"for I've staked off a\nbit about six feet long an' two broad, to plant mesilf in whin I give up\nthe ghost.\"\n\nThis mild pleasantry seemed to calm a little the rising wrath of\ncontending parties, much to Dominick's satisfaction, for he was\nexceedingly anxious to keep in the background and avoid interference.\nDuring the week that had passed, he had more than once been forced to\nhave sharp words with Malines, and felt that if he was to act as a\npeacemaker--which he earnestly wished to do--he must avoid quarrelling\nwith him if possible.\n\nThe hopes of those who wished to settle matters amicably, however, were\ndashed by the fiery tailor, who, still smarting under the contemptuous\ntones and words of the mate, suddenly sprang to his feet and suggested\nthat, as Malines knew nothing about agriculture, no land at all should\nbe apportioned to him, but that he should be set to fishing, or some\nsuch dirty work, for the benefit of the community.\n\nThis was too much for Malines, who strode towards Buxley with clenched\nfists and furious looks, evidently intending to knock him down.  To the\nsurprise and amusement of every one, Buxley threw himself into a\npugilistic attitude, and shouted defiantly, \"Come on!\"  There is no\nsaying how the thing would have ended, if Dominick had not quickly\ninterposed.\n\n\"Come, Mr Malines,\" he said, \"it is not very creditable in you to\nthreaten a man so very much smaller than yourself.\"\n\n\"Out of my road,\" shouted the mate, fiercely, \"we don't want _gentlemen_\nto lord it over us.\"\n\n\"No, nor yet _blackguards_,\" growled a voice in the crowd.\n\nThis so angered Malines, that he dealt Dominick a sounding slap on the\ncheek.\n\nFor a moment there was dead silence, as the two men glared at each\nother.  If it had been a blow the youth might have stood it better, but\nthere was something so stinging, as well as insulting, in a slap, that\nfor a moment he felt as if his chest would explode.  Before he could\nact, however, Joe Binney thrust his bulky form between the men.\n\n\"Leave'm to me, master,\" he said, quietly turning up his wristbands,\n\"I'm used to this sort o' thing, an'--\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Dominick, in a deep, decided voice, \"listen.\"\n\nHe grasped Joe by the arm, and whispered a few words in his ear.  A\nsmile broke over the man's face, and he shook his head doubtfully.\n\n\"Well, it may be so,\" he remarked, \"an' no doubt it would have a good\neffect.\"\n\n\"Now, then, stand aside,\" said Dominick, as he retreated a few paces and\nthrew off his coat, while Malines still stood in a threatening attitude,\nwith an expression of contempt on his face.  \"My friends,\" he said, as\nhe slowly rolled up his shirt-sleeves, showing a pair of arms which,\nalthough not bulky, displayed an amount of sinews and muscle that was\nsuggestive of knotted ropes under a fair skin--\n\n\"My friends,\" he said, \"somewhere in the Bible it is written, `Smite a\nscorner, and the simple will beware.'  I have done my best to conciliate\n_this_ scorner without success; I shall now try to smite him.\"\n\n\"An' brother David an' me will see fair play,\" remarked Joe Binney.\n\nIf the combatants had been more equally matched, the spectators would\nprobably have encouraged Dominick with a cheer, but the difference in\nsize was so apparent, that astonishment kept them silent.  Dominick was\nindeed fully as tall as his opponent, and his shoulders were nearly as\nbroad, but the massive weight of Malines's figure seemed to render the\nchance of Dominick's success highly improbable.\n\nThe youth sprang at him, however, like lightning, and, hitting him a\nviolent blow on the forehead, leapt back out of his reach.\n\nThe blow had the effect that was intended; it roused the mate's wrath to\nthe utmost pitch, causing him to rush at his opponent, striking right\nand left with all his force.  Dominick, however, leapt about with such\nactivity, that only a few of the blows reached him, and these not with\ntheir full force.  The result was that the mate became what is styled\nwinded in a few minutes, and was compelled to pause to recover himself,\nbut Dominick had no intention of allowing him time to recover himself.\nWithout a moment's hesitation, he sprang in again and planted a severe\nleft-hander between his opponent's eyes.  This roused the mate once more\nto white heat, and he sought to close with his foe, but the latter\nprevented that by leaping aside, tripping him up, and causing him to\nplunge forward on his hands and knees--assisting him to that position\nwith a stiff rap on the right temple as he passed.\n\nThen it was that Malines discovered that he had drawn on himself the\nwrath of one who had been the champion boxer in a large public school,\nand was quite as tough as himself in wind and limb, though not so strong\nor so heavy.\n\nNow, it is not our intention to give a graphic account of that\npugilistic encounter.  Yet is it needful to point out briefly how, being\na man of peace, as well as a man of science, Dominick managed to bring\nthis fight to as speedy a close as possible.  Instead, then, of striking\nhis foe in all directions, and producing a disgusting scene of\nbloodshed, he confined his practice chiefly to one spot, between the\neyes, close above the bridge of the nose--varying it a little with a\nshot now and then under each eye.  This had the effect, owing to\nconstant repetition, of gradually shutting up both Malines's eyes so\nthat he could not easily see.  When in this condition, Dominick suddenly\ndelivered first a left and then a right hander into what is sometimes\ncalled the breadbasket, and stretched his adversary on the sand.\n\nDominick was not boastful or ungenerous.  He did not crow over his\nfallen foe.  On the contrary, he offered to assist that smitten scorner\nto rise, but Malines preferred in the meantime to lie still.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to say that the emigrants watched this short\nbut sharp encounter with keen interest, and when it was ended gave vent\nto a cheer, in which surprise was quite as clearly expressed as\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"Now, I tell 'ee what it is, lads,\" said Joe Binney, striking his great\nright fist into the palm of his left hand enthusiastically, \"I never\nseed the likes o' that since I was a leetle booy, and I've got a motion\nfor to propose, as they say at meetin's.  It's this, that we makes\nMaster Dom'nik Riggundy capting over us all.\"\n\nUp started Teddy Malone, with a slap of his thigh.  \"And it's mesilf\nas'll second that motion--only we should make him governor of the whole\nisland, if not king!\"\n\n\"Hear! hear!\" shouted a decided majority of the party.  \"Let him be\nking!\"\n\nWhen silence had been partially restored Dominick politely but firmly\ndeclined the honour, giving it as his opinion that the fairest way would\nbe to have a republic.\n\n\"A republic!  No; what we wants is a despotism,\" said David Binney, who\nhad up to this point remained silent, \"a regular despot--a howtocrat--is\nwhat we wants to keep us in order.\"\n\n\"Hump!\" exclaimed Hugh Morris, contemptuously, \"if you'd on'y let\nMalines have his way you'd soon have a despot an' a howtocrat as 'ud\nkeep yer noses to the grindstone.\"\n\n\"Mrs Lynch,\" whispered Otto, who had hitherto stood beside the widow\nwatching the proceedings with inexpressible glee, \"you get up an'\npropose that Pina should be _queen_!\"\n\nThat this suggestion came upon the widow with a shock of surprise, as\nwell as approval, was obvious from the wide-eyed stare, with which for a\nmoment she regarded the boy, and from her subsequent action.  Taking a\nbold and masculine stride to the front of the disputers, she turned\nabout and faced them.\n\n\"Howld yer tongues now, boys, all of you, and listen to what your\ngrandmother's got to say.\"\n\nA shout of laughter cut her short for a few seconds.\n\n\"That's right, old 'ooman, out with it.\"\n\n\"Sure, if ye'd stop your noise I'd out wid it fast enough.  Now, then,\nhere ye are, nivver a man of ye able to agree wid the others; an' the\nraisin's not far to seek--for yer all wrong togither.  It would nivver\ndo to make wan o' you a king--not even Joe here, for he knows nixt to\nnothin', nor yet Mister Rig Gundy, though he can fight like a man, for\nit's not a king's business to fight.  No, take my word for it; what ye\nwant is a _queen_--\"\n\nA loud explosion of mirth drowned the rest.  \"Hurrah! for Queen Lynch,\"\ncried one.  \"The Royal blood of owld Ireland for ivver!\" shouted Malone.\n\n\"I wouldn't,\" said the widow indignantly, \"condescind to reign over\nsitch a nation o' pigs, av ye was to go down on yer bare knees an'\nscrape them to the bone.  No, it's English blood, or Spanitch, I don't\nrightly know which, that I'm drivin' at, for where could ye find a\nbetter, or honester, or purtier queen than that swate creetur, Miss\nPauline Rig Gundy?\"\n\nThe idea seemed to break upon the assembly as a light in a dark place.\nFor a moment they seemed struck dumb; then there burst forth such a\ncheer as showed that the greater part of those present sympathised\nheartily with the proposal.\n\n\"I know'd ye'd agree to it.  Sure, men always does when a sensible woman\nspakes.  You see, Queen Pauline the First--\"\n\n\"Hurrah! for Queen Pauline the First,\" yelled the settlers, with mingled\ncheers and laughter.\n\n\"Queen Pauline the First, ye may be sure,\" continued the widow, \"would\nnivver try to kape order wid her fists, nor yit wid shoutin' or\nswearin'.  An' then, av coorse, it would be aisy to make Mister Duminick\nor Joe Binney Prime Minister, an' little Buxley Chancler o' the\nCheckers, or whatever they calls it.  Now, think over it, boys, an' good\nluck be wid ye.\"\n\nThey did think over it, then and there, in real earnest, and the\npossibility of an innocent, sensible, gentle, just, sympathetic, and\nhigh-minded queen reigning over them proved so captivating to these\nrough fellows, that the idea which had been at first received in jest\ncrystallised into a serious purpose.  At this point Otto ventured to\nraise his voice in this first deliberation of the embryo State.\n\n\"Friends,\" he said, with an air of modesty, which, we fear, was foreign\nto his nature, \"although I can only appear before you as a boy, my big\nbrother has this day proved himself to be so much more than an ordinary\nman that I feel somehow as if I had a right to his surplus manhood,\nbeing next-of-kin, and therefore I venture to address you as a sort of\nman.\"  (Hear, hear!) \"I merely wish to ask a question.  May I ask to be\nthe bearer of the news of this assembly's determination to--the--the\n_Queen_?\"\n\n\"Yes--yes--of course--av course,\" were the immediate replies.\n\nOtto waited not for more, but sped to their new hut, in which the Queen\nwas busy preparing dinner at the time.\n\n\"Pina,\" exclaimed the boy, bursting in, \"will you consent to be the\nQueen of Big Island?\"\n\n\"Come, Otto; don't talk nonsense.  I hope Dom is with you.  Dinner is\nmuch overdone already.\"\n\n\"No, but I'm not talking nonsense,\" cried Otto.  \"I say, will you\nconsent to be a queen--a _real_ queen--Pina the First, eh?\"\n\nHereupon he gave his wondering sister a graphic account of the recent\nmeeting, and fight, and final decision.\n\n\"But they don't really mean it, you know,\" said Pauline, laughing.\n\n\"But they do really mean it,\" returned Otto; \"and, by the way, if _you_\nbecome a queen won't that necessarily make me and Dom princes?\"\n\nAs Dominick entered the hut at that moment he joined in the laugh which\nthis question created, and corroborated his brother's statement.\n\nIn this cheerful frame of mind the new Royal Family sat down to dinner.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\n\nTHE CORONATION--CROWN-MAKING DELIBERATIONS, CEREMONIALS, AND\nCATASTROPHES.\n\nThere came a day, not many weeks later in the history of our emigrants,\nwhen great preparations were made for an important and unusual event.\n\nThis was neither more nor less than the coronation of Queen Pauline the\nFirst.\n\nThe great event had been delayed by the unfortunate illness of the elect\nqueen herself--an illness brought on by reckless exposure in the pursuit\nof the picturesque and beautiful among the islets of the lagoon.  In\nother words, Otto and she, when off on a fishing and sketching excursion\nin the dinghy of the wreck, had been caught in a storm and drenched to\nthe skin.  The result to Otto was an increase of appetite; to Pauline, a\nsharp attack of fever, which confined her for some time to the palace,\nas their little hut was now styled.  Here the widow Lynch--acting the\nunited parts of nurse, lady of the bedchamber, mistress of the robes,\nmaid of honour, _chef de cuisine_, and any other office that the reader\nmay recollect as belonging to royalty--did so conduct herself as to gain\nnot only the approval but the affection and gratitude of her royal\nmistress.\n\nDuring the period of Pauline's convalescence considerable changes had\ntaken place in the circumstances and condition of the community.  The\nmere fact that a government had been fixed on, the details of which were\nbeing wrought out by a committee of leading men appointed by the people,\ntended to keep the turbulent spirits pretty quiet, and enabled the\nwell-disposed to devote all their strength of mind and body to the\nvarious duties that devolved upon them and the improving of their\ncircumstances.  Busy workers are usually peaceful.  They have no time to\nquarrel.  It is only when turbulent idlers interfere with or oppress\nthem that the industrious are compelled to show their teeth and set up\ntheir backs.\n\nDuring these weeks the appearance of the shores of Big Island began to\nchange materially.  All round the edge of Silver Bay a number of bright\ngreen patches were enclosed by rough but effective fences.  These were\nthe gardens of the community, in which sweet potatoes, yams, etcetera,\ngrew spontaneously, while some vegetables of the northern hemisphere had\nalready been sown, and were in some cases even beginning to show above\nground.  In these gardens, when the important work of planting had been\nfinished, the people set about building huts of various shapes and\nsizes, according to their varying taste and capacity.\n\nEven at this early stage in the life of the little community the\ndifficulties which necessarily surround a state of civilisation began to\nappear, and came out at one of the frequent, though informal, meetings\nof the men on the sands of Silver Bay.  It happened thus:--\n\nIt was evening.  The younger and more lively men of the community,\nhaving a large store of surplus energy unexhausted after the labours of\nthe day, began, as is the wont of the young and lively, to compete with\none another in feats of agility and strength, while a group of their\nelders stood, sat, or reclined on a bank, discussing the affairs of the\nnation, and some of them enjoying their pipes--for, you see, everything\nin the wreck having been saved, they had, among other bad things, plenty\nof tobacco.\n\nDr Marsh sat among the elders, for, although several weeks on shore had\ngreatly restored his health, he was still too weak to join in the\nathletics.  A few of the women and children also looked on, but they\nstood aside by themselves, not feeling very much interested in the\nsomewhat heated discussions of the men.\n\nBy degrees these discussions degenerated into disputes, and became at\nlast so noisy that the young athletes were attracted, and some of them\ntook part in the debates.\n\n\"I tell 'ee what it is,\" exclaimed Nobbs, the blacksmith, raising his\npowerful voice above the other voices, and lifting his huge fist in the\nair, \"something'll have to be done, for I can't go on workin' for\nnothin' in this fashion.\"\n\n\"No more can I, or my mates,\" said Abel Welsh, the carpenter.\n\n\"Here comes the Prime Minister,\" cried Teddy Malone.\n\n\"To _be_--he ain't Prime Minister yet,\" growled Jabez Jenkins, who,\nbeing a secret ally of Hugh Morris, was one of the disaffected, and had,\nbesides, a natural tendency to growl and object to everything.\n\n\"He _is_ Prime Minister,\" cried the fiery little Buxley, starting up and\nextending his hand with the air of one who is about to make a speech.\n\"No doubt the Queen ain't crowned yet, an' hasn't therefore appointed\nany one to be her Minister, but we know she means to do it and we're all\nagreed about it.\"\n\n\"No we ain't,\" interrupted Jenkins, angrily.\n\n\"Well, the most on us, then,\" retorted Buxley.\n\n\"Shut up, you radical!\" said Nobbs, giving the tailor a facetious slap\non the back, \"an' let's hear what the Prime Minister himself has got to\nsay about it.\"\n\n\"What is the subject under discussion?\" inquired Dominick, who, with\nOtto, joined the group of men at the moment and flung down a basket of\nfine fish which he had just caught in the lagoon.\n\nHe turned to Dr Marsh for an answer.\n\n\"Do _you_ explain your difficulties,\" said the doctor to the blacksmith.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said Nobbs, \"here's where it is.  When I fust comed ashore\nan' set up my anvil an' bellows I went to work with a will, enjyin' the\nfun o' the thing an' the novelty of the sitivation; an' as we'd lots of\niron of all kinds I knocked off nails an' hinges an' all sorts o' things\nfor anybody as wanted 'em.  Similarly, w'en Abel Welsh comed ashore he\nwent to work with his mates at the pit-saw an' tossed off no end o'\nplanks, etceterer.  But you see, sir, arter a time we come for to find\nthat we're workin' to the whole population for nothin', and while\neverybody else is working away at his own hut or garden, or what not,\n_our_ gardens is left to work themselves, an' _our_ huts is nowhere!\nNow, as we've got no money to pay for work with, and as stones an'\nshells won't answer the purpus--seein' there's a sight too much of 'em--\nthe question is, what's to be done?\"\n\n\"Not an easy question to answer, Nobbs,\" said Dominick, \"and one that\nrequires serious consideration.  Perhaps, instead of trying to answer it\nat present, we might find a temporary expedient for the difficulty until\na Committee of the House--if I may say so--shall investigate the whole\nproblem.\"  (Hear, hear from Malone, Redding, and Buxley, and a growl\nfrom Jenkins.) \"I would suggest, then, in the meantime, that while Nobbs\nand Welsh,--who are, perhaps, the most useful men among us--continue to\nply their trades for the benefit of the community, every man in the\ncommunity shall in turn devote a small portion of time to working in the\ngardens and building the huts of these two men.\"  (Hear, hear, from a\ngreat many of the hearers, and dissenting growls from a few.) \"But,\"\ncontinued Dominick, \"as there are evidently some here who are not of an\nobliging disposition, and as the principle of willing service lies at\nthe root of all social felicity, I would further suggest that, until our\nQueen is crowned and the Government fairly set up, all such labour shall\nbe undertaken entirely by volunteers.\"\n\nThis proposal was agreed to with boisterous acclaim, and nearly the\nwhole community volunteered on the spot.  While this little difficulty\nwas being overcome, Pauline lay sleeping in the palace hard by, and the\nenthusiastic cheer with which the conclusion of Dominick's speech was\nreceived awoke her.\n\n\"There--I know'd they'd do it!\" exclaimed the lady of the bedchamber\nfiercely; \"lie still, cushla! an' shut your purty eyes.  Maybe you'll\ndrop off again!\"\n\nA humorous smile beamed in Pauline's countenance and twinkled in her\neyes.\n\n\"Thank you, dear nurse, I've had enough of sleep.  Indeed, I begin to\nfeel so strong that I think I shall very soon be able to undergo that--\"\n\nPauline stopped and burst into a fit of merry laughter.\n\n\"It's that caronation, now, ye'll be thinkin' av?\" said the widow Lynch,\nwith a reproving look.  \"Faix, it's no laughin' matter ye'll find it,\ndear.  It's onaisy is the hid as wears a crown.\"\n\n\"Why you talk, nurse, as if you had worn one yourself, and knew all\nabout its troubles.\"\n\n\"Sure, av I didn't, me progenissors did, in Munster, before you English\nkonkered us an' turned us topsy-turvy.  But nivver mind.  I don't bear\nno ill-will to 'ee, darlint, bekaise o' the evil deeds o' yer\nforefathers.  I'm of a forgivin' disposition.  An' it's a good quane\nyou'll make, too, av ye don't let the men have too much o' their own\nway.  But I do think that you an' me togither'll be more than a match\nfor them all.  D'ee think ye could stand the caronation now, dear?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think I could.  But really, you know, I find it so hard to\nbelieve it is not all a joke, despite the grave deputations that have\nwaited on me, and the serious arguments they have used.  The idea of\nmaking me--_Me_--a Queen!\"\n\nAgain Pauline Rigonda gave way to merry laughter, and again did her lady\nof the bedchamber administer a reproof by expressing the hope that she\nmight take the matter as lightly a year hence.\n\nThis pertinacious reference to possible trouble being mingled with the\ncontemplated honour checked Pauline's disposition to laugh, and she had\nquite recovered her gravity when her brother Otto entered.\n\n\"Pina, I've come to tell you that they've fixed the coronation for\nMonday next if you feel up to it, and that the new palace is begun--a\nvery different one, let me tell you, from this wretched affair with its\ntumble-down walls and low roof.\"\n\n\"Indeed--is it so very grand?\"\n\n\"Grand!  I should think it is.  Why, it has got three rooms--_three_\nrooms--think o' that!  Not countin' a splendid out-house stuck on\nbehind, about ten feet square and over six feet high.  Each of the three\nrooms is twelve feet long by ten broad; seven feet high, and papered\nwith palm leaves.  The middle one is the hall of Audience and Justice--\nor injustice if you like--the Council Chamber, the House of Parliament,\nthe mess-room, and the drawing-room.  The one on the right with two\nwindows, from which are magnificent views, is your Majesty's\nsleeping-room and boudoir; that on the left is the ditto of Prime\nMinister Dominick and his Chief Secretary Prince Otto.  The sort of\nhen-coop stuck on behind is to be the abode of the Court Physician, Dr\nJohn Marsh--whom, by the way, you'll have to knight--and with whom is to\nbe billeted the Court Jester, Man-at-Arms, Man-of-all-work and general\nretainer, little Buxley.  So, you see, it's all cut and dry, though of\ncourse it will take some little time to finish the palace in all its\nmultitudinous details.  Meanwhile I have been sent to sound you as to\nMonday next.  Will you be able and ready?\"\n\n\"If I could only get myself to believe,\" answered Pauline, as she leaned\non one elbow on her couch, and toyed contemplatively with a fold of the\nshawl that covered her, \"that the people are really in earnest, I--\"\n\n\"Really in earnest!\" repeated Otto.  \"Why, Pina, never were people more\nin earnest in this world.  If you'd heard and seen them talking about it\nas I have, you'd not doubt their earnestness.  Besides, you have no idea\nhow needful you are to the community.  The fact is, it is composed of\nsuch rough and rowdy elements--though of course there are some\nrespectable and well-principled fellows among them--that nothing short\nof a power standing high above them and out o' their reach will have any\ninfluence with them at all.  There are so many strong, determined, and\nself-willed men amongst them that there's no chance of their ever\nagreeing to submit to each other; so, you see, you are a sort of good\nangel, before whom they will be only too glad to bow--a kind of superior\nbeing, whom they will reverence, and to whom they will submit--a human\nsafety-valve, in short, to prevent the community from blowing up--a\nspecies of--of--\"\n\nHere Pauline burst into another of her irrepressible fits of laughter,\nand being joined therein by Prince Otto, called forth a remonstrance\nfrom Mrs Lynch, who declared that if that was the way they were goin'\nto manage the affairs of state, she would be obliged to advise the\nsettlers to change their minds and set up a republic.\n\n\"An' sure, mother,\" said Otto, who was a privileged favourite, \"nothing\ncould be better, with yourself as President.\"\n\n\"Go along wid ye, boy, an' do yer dooty.  Tell the people that Miss\nPauline will be ready--wind an' weather permittin'.\"\n\n\"Am I to take back that message, Pina?\" asked Otto, with a look of glee.\n\n\"Well, I suppose you may.\"\n\nIt was not in the nature of things that a coronation in the\ncircumstances which we have described should take place without being\nmore or less intermingled with the unavoidable absurdities which mark\nthe coronations of older and more densely peopled lands.  It was felt\nthat as the act was a seriously meant reality, and no mere joke, it\nshould be gone about and accomplished with all due solemnity and proper\nceremonial, somewhat after the pattern--as Teddy Malone suggested--of a\nLord Mayor's Show; a suggestion, by the way, which did not conduce to\nthe solemnity of the preliminary discussions.\n\nThere was one great difficulty, however, with which the embryo nation\nhad to contend, and this was that not one of the community had ever seen\na coronation, or knew how the details of the matter should be arranged.\n\nIn these circumstances an assembly of the entire nation was convened to\nconsider the matter.  As this convention embraced the women (except, of\ncourse, the queen elect), it included the babies, and as most of these\nwere self-assertive and well-developed in chest and throat, it was found\nnecessary to relegate them and the women to an outer circle, while the\nmen in an inner circle tackled the problem.\n\nThe widow Lynch, being quite irrepressible except by physical force, and\neven by that with difficulty, was admitted on sufferance to the inner\ncircle, and took part in the discussions.\n\nLike most large assemblies, this one was found so unmanageable, that,\nafter an hour or two of hopeless wrangling, Buxley the tailor started up\nwith dishevelled hair and glaring eyeballs, and uttered a yell that\nproduced a momentary silence.  Seizing the moment, he said--\n\n\"I moves that we apint a committee to inquire into the whole matter an'\nreport.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear, and well said!\" shouted a multitude of voices.\n\n\"An' _I_ moves,\" cried Mrs Lynch, starting forward with both arms up\nand all her fingers rampant, \"that--\"\n\n\"No, no, mother,\" interrupted Buxley, \"you must second the motion.\"\n\n\"Howld yer tongue, ye dirty spalpeen!  Isn't it the second motion that\nI'm puttin'?  _I_ moves that the committee is Mr Dumnik Rig Gundy an'\nDr Marsh--\"\n\n\"An' _Mister_ Nobbs,\" shouted a voice.\n\n\"An' _Mister_ Joe Binney,\" said another.\n\n\"An' _little_ Mister Buxley, be way of variashun,\" cried Teddy Malone.\n\n\"An' Mistress Lynch, for a change,\" growled Jabez Jenkins.\n\n\"Hear, hear!  No, no!  Hurrah!  Nonsense!  Howld yer tongue!  Be\nserious!\"--gradually drowned in a confusion of tongues with a yelling\naccompaniment from infantry in the outer circle.\n\nIt was finally agreed, however, that the arrangements for the coronation\nshould be left entirely to a committee composed of Dominick, Dr Marsh,\nJoe Binney, and Hugh Morris--Joe being put forward as representing the\nagricultural interest, and Hugh the malcontents.  Teddy Malone was added\nto make an odd number, \"for there's luck in odd numbers,\" as he himself\nremarked on accepting office.\n\nImmediately after the general meeting broke up, these five retired to\nthe privacy of a neighbouring palm grove, where, seated on a verdant and\nflowering bank, they proceeded calmly to discuss details.\n\n\"You see, my friends,\" said Dominick, \"it must be our most earnest\nendeavour to carry out this important matter in a serious and\nbusiness-like manner.  Already there is too much of a spirit of levity\namong the people, who seem to look at the whole affair as a sort of game\nor joke, playing, as it were, at national life, whereas we actually\n_are_ an independent nation--\"\n\n\"A small wan, av coorse,\" murmured Malone.\n\n\"Yes, a small one, but not the less real on that account, so that we are\nentitled to manage our own affairs, arrange our own government, and,\ngenerally, to act according to our united will.  These islands and their\nsurroundings are unknown--at least they are not put down on any chart; I\nbelieve we have discovered them.  There are no inhabitants to set up a\ncounter claim; therefore, being entitled to act according to our will,\nour appointment of a queen to rule us--under limited powers, to be\nhereafter well considered and clearly written down--is a reality; not a\nmere play or semi-jest to be undone lightly when the fancy takes us.\nThat being so, we must go to work with gravity and earnestness of\npurpose.\"\n\nTeddy Malone, who was an impressionable creature, here became so\nsolemnised that his lengthening visage and seriously wrinkled brow\nrendered gravity--especially on the part of Dr Marsh--almost\nimpossible.\n\nOvercoming his feelings with a powerful effort the doctor assented to\nwhat Dominick said, and suggested that some mild sort of ceremonial\nshould be devised for the coronation, in order to impress the beholders\nas well as to mark the event.\n\n\"That's so,\" said Teddy Malone, \"somethin' quiet an' orderly, like an\nIrish wake, or--.  Ah! then ye needn't smile, doctor.  It's the quietest\nan' most comfortin' thing in life is an Irish wake whin it's gone about\nproperly.\"\n\n\"But we don't want comforting, Teddy,\" said Dominick, \"it is rather a\nsubject for rejoicing.\"\n\n\"Well, then, what's to hinder us rejoicin' in comfort?\" returned Teddy.\n\"At all the wakes I ivver attinded there was more rejoicin' than\ncomfortin' goin' on; but that's a matter of taste, av coorse.\"\n\n\"There'll have to be a crown o' some sort,\" remarked Hugh Morris.\n\n\"You're right, lad,\" said Joe Binney.  \"It wouldn't do to make it o'\npasteboard, would it?  P'r'aps that 'ud be too like playin' at a game,\nan' tin would be little better.\"\n\n\"What else can we make it of, boys?\" said Malone, \"we've got no goold\nhere--worse luck! but maybe the carpenter cud make wan o' wood.  With a\nlick o' yellow paint it would look genuine.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Teddy,\" said the doctor, \"don't you see that in this life men\nshould always be guided by circumstances, and act with propriety.  Here\nwe are on an island surrounded by coral reefs, going to elect a queen;\nwhat more appropriate than that her crown should be made of coral.\"\n\n\"The very thing, doctor,\" cried Malone, with emphasis, \"och! it's the\ngenius ye have!  There's all kinds o' coral, red and white, an' we could\nmix it up wi' some o' that fine-coloured seaweed to make it purty.\"\n\n\"It could be made pritty enough without seaweed,\" said Binney, \"an' it's\nmy notion that the women-folk would be best at makin' of it.\"\n\n\"Right, Joe, right, so, if you have no objection, we will leave it to\nthem,\" said Dominick, \"and now as to the ceremonial?\"\n\n\"A pursession,\" suggested Joe Binney.\n\n\"Just so,\" said Hugh Morris, \"the very thing as was in my mind.\"\n\n\"And a throne,\" cried Malone, \"there couldn't be a proper quane widout a\nthrone, you know.  The carpenter can make that, anyhow, for there's wood\ngalore on the island--red, black, an' white.  Yis, we must have a grand\nthrone, cut, an' carved, an' mounted high, so as she'll have two or\nthree steps to climb up to it.\"\n\nIn regard to the procession and the throne there was considerable\ndifference of opinion, but difficulties were got over and smoothed down\nat last by the tact and urbanity of Dominick, to whom, finally, the\nwhole question of the coronation was committed.  Thus it frequently\nhappens among men.  In the multitude of counsellors there is wisdom\nenough, usually, to guide in the selection of the fittest man to take\nthe helm in all important affairs.\n\nAnd that reminds us that it is high time to terminate this long\ndigression, and guide our readers back to the beginning of the chapter,\nwhere we stated that the important day had at last arrived.\n\nHappily, in those highly favoured climes weather has not usually to be\ntaken much into account.  The sun arose out of the ocean's breast with\nthe same unclouded beauty that had marked his rise every morning for a\nweek previously, and would probably mark it for a week to come.  The\nsweet scents of the wooded heights floated down on the silver strand;\nthe sharks ruffled the surface of the lagoon with their black fins, the\nbirds hopped or flew from palm-tree to mimosa-bush, and the waterfowl\nwent about according to taste on lazy or whistling wings, intent on\ndaily business, much as though nothing unusual were \"in the air.\"\n\nBut it was otherwise with the human family on Big Island.  Unwonted\nexcitement was visible on almost every face.  Bustle was in every\naction.  Preparations were going on all round, and, as some members of\nthe community were bent on giving other members a surprise, there was\nmore or less of secrecy and consequent mystery in the behaviour of every\none.\n\nBy breakfast-time little Mrs Nobbs, the blacksmith's laughter-loving\nwife, had nearly laughed herself into fits of delight at the crown,\nwhich she assisted Mrs Welsh and the widow Lynch to fabricate.  The\nlast had devised it, Mrs Welsh had built it in the rough, and Mrs\nNobbs had finished it off with the pretty little wreath of red and white\nbranching coral that formed its apex.  Apart from taste it was a\nstupendous erection.\n\n\"But don't you think that it's too big and heavy?\" cried Mrs Nobbs,\nwith a shrieking giggle and clapping of her hands, as she ran back to\nhave a distant view of it.\n\n\"Pooh!\" exclaimed Mrs Lynch contemptuously, \"too heavy?  No, it's\nnothin', my dear, to what the kings an' quanes of Munster wore.\"\n\n\"But Miss Pauline is neither a king nor a queen of Munster, an' I do\nthink it's a bit over-heavy,\" objected Mrs Welsh, as she lifted the\nstructure with difficulty.\n\n\"Well, ye might take off the wreath,\" was the widow's reply.\n\nMrs Nobbs removed the only part of the erection that was really pretty,\nbut still it was pronounced by Mrs Welsh to be too heavy, especially\nfor the fair and delicate brows of Pauline Rigonda.\n\nWhile they were thus engaged Dr Marsh entered the hut, where, for the\nsake of secrecy, the crown had been prepared, but Dr Marsh was a\nprivileged man, besides he was there professionally; little Brown-eyes\nwas sick--not seriously, but sufficiently so to warrant medical\nintervention.\n\n\"Well, what have we here, ladies?\" said the doctor blandly, \"part of the\nthrone, eh?\"\n\n\"Sure it is, in a sort of way, for it's the crown,\" answered Mrs Lynch,\n\"an' they think it's over-heavy.\"\n\n\"Not at all; by no means,\" cried the doctor heartily.  \"It's splendid.\nPut the wreath on--so.  Nothing could be finer.  Shall I carry it up for\nyou?  The coronation is fixed for noon, you know, so that we may have\ntime to finish off with a grand feast.\"\n\n\"No, no, doctor dear.  Thank 'ee kindly, but we must cover it up, so's\nnot to let the people see it till the right time.\"\n\n\"Well, see that you're not late with it.\"\n\nHaving caused Brown-eyes to put out her little tongue, and felt her\npulse, and nodded his head gravely once or twice without speaking, all\nof which must have been highly comforting and beneficial to the child,\nthe doctor went out.\n\nNot long afterwards the people began to assemble round the palace, in\nfront of which a wondrous throne had been erected.  Down in a dell\nbehind a cliff some fifty men had assembled secretly with the crown on a\ncushion in their midst.  They were headed by Dr Marsh, who had been\nunanimously elected to place the crown on Pauline's head.  In the palace\nPauline was being prepared by Mrs Lynch and Mrs Nobbs for the\nceremony.\n\nOn the top of a mound close to the palace a band of conspirators was\nassembled.  These conspirators were screened from view by some thick\nbushes.  Otto Rigonda was their ringleader, Teddy Malone and little\nBuxley formed the rest of the band.  Otto had found a dead tree.  Its\ntrunk had been hollowed by decay.  He and his fellow-conspirators had\nsawn it off near to the ground, and close to the root they had drilled a\ntouch-hole.  This huge piece of ordnance they had loaded with a heavy\ncharge of the ship's gunpowder.  Otto now stood ready with a piece of\nslow-match at the touch-hole, and another piece, lighted, in hand.\n\nSuddenly, about the hour of noon, Abel Welsh the carpenter, and Nobbs\nthe blacksmith, issued from the palace with two long tin implements.\nSecretly, for two weeks previously, had these devoted men retired every\nnight to the opposite extremity of Big Island, and frightened into fits\nthe birds and beasts of that region with the sounds they produced in\npractising on those instruments.  Applying the trumpets to their lips,\nthey sent forth a tremendous, though not uniform, blast.\n\nThe surrounding crowd, who expected something, but knew not what,\nreplied with a cheer not unmixed with laughter, for the two trumpets,\nafter the manner of asses, had to make some ineffectual preliminary\nefforts before achieving a full-toned bray.  An answering note from the\ndell, however, repressed the laughter and awoke curiosity.  Next moment\nthe doctor appeared carrying the crown, and followed by his fifty men,\narmed with muskets, rifles, fowling-pieces, and revolvers.  Their\nappearance was so realistic and impressive that the people forgot to\ncheer.  At the same moment the palace door was thrown open, and Dominick\nled the youthful queen to the foot of the throne.\n\nPoor little Pauline looked so modest and pretty, and even timid, and\nwithal so angelically innocent in the simplicity of her attire, that the\npeople burst into an earnestly enthusiastic shout, and began for the\nfirst time to feel that this was no game or play, but a serious reality.\n\nThings had been so arranged that Pina and Dr Marsh reached the foot of\nthe throne together.  Then the latter took the pretty coral wreath off\nthe huge crown, and, to widow Lynch's felt, but not expressed,\nindignation, placed _that_ on Pauline's head.\n\n\"Pauline Rigonda,\" he said in a loud voice, \"I have been appointed by\nthe people of this island to crown you, in their name and by their\nauthority, as Queen of Refuge Islands, in the full belief that your\ninnocence and regard for truth and righteousness will be their best\nguarantee that you will select as your assistants the men whom you think\nbest suited to aid you in the promotion of good government.\"\n\nThe serious tone of the doctor's voice, and the genuine shouts of\nsatisfaction from the people, put the poor little queen in such a\nflutter that nearly all her courage forsook her, and she could scarcely\nreply.  Nevertheless, she had a mind of her own.\n\n\"Doctor Marsh, and my dear people,\" she said at last, \"I--I scarcely\nknow how to reply.  You overrate me altogether; but--but, if I rule at\nall, I will do so by the blessed truths of this book (she held up a\nBible); and--and before taking a single step further I appoint as my--my\nPrime Minister--if I may so call him--Joe Binney.\"\n\nFor one moment there was the silence of amazement, for neither Dominick\nnor Dr Marsh knew of Pauline's intention.  Only the widow Lynch had\nbeen aware of her resolve.  Next moment a hilarious cheer burst from the\ncrowd, and Teddy Malone, from his retreat, shouted, \"God bliss the\nQuane!\" which infused hearty laughter into the cheer, whereupon Welsh\nand Nobbs, thinking the right time had come, sent out of their tin\ntubes, after a few ineffectual blurts, two terrific brays.  Fearing to\nbe too late, one of the armed men let off his piece, which was the\nsignal for a grand _feu de joie_.\n\n\"Now for it,\" thought the chief conspirator in the bushes, as he applied\nhis light to the slow-match.  He thought nothing more just then, for the\nslow-match proved to be rather quick, fired the powder at once, and the\nmonster cannon, bursting with a hideous roar into a thousand pieces,\nblew Otto through the bushes and down the mound, at the foot of which he\nlay as one dead.\n\nConsternation was on every face.  The queen, dropping her crown, sprang\nto his side, Dr Marsh did the same, but Otto recovered almost\nimmediately.\n\n\"That _was_ a stunner!\" he said, with a confused look, putting his hand\nto his head, as they helped him to rise.\n\nStrange to say, he was none the worse of the misadventure, but did his\npart nobly at the Royal feast that followed.\n\nThat night she who had risen with the sun as Pauline Rigonda, laid her\nfair young head upon the pillow as--the Island Queen.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINE.\n\nSHOWS HOW THEY WERE TORMENTED BY AN OLD FAMILIAR FIEND; HOW THEY KILLED\nHIM, AND WHAT BEFELL THE QUEEN AND OTTO WHILE IN THE PURSUIT OF\nLEGITIMATE PLEASURE.\n\nWhen the widow Lynch told Pauline that \"onaisy is the hid as wears a\ncrown,\" she stated a great truth which was borne in upon the poor queen\nat the very commencement of her reign.\n\nUp to that time Malines had quietly kept possession of the key of the\nship's liquor-room, knowing full well what extreme danger lay in letting\nmen have unrestrained command of strong drink.  But when the royal feast\nreferred to in the last chapter was pending, he could not well refuse to\nissue an allowance of grog.  He did so, however, on the understanding\nthat only a small quantity was to be taken for the occasion, and that he\nshould himself open and lock the door for them.  He made this\nstipulation because he knew well enough the men who wanted to drink\nwould break the door open if he refused to give up the key; and his\nfears were justified, for some of the more mutinous among the men, under\nthe leadership of Jabez Jenkins and Morris, seized the key from the mate\nwhen he produced it, carried all the spirit and wine casks to the shore,\nferried them over the lagoon to Big Island, and set them up\nostentatiously and conspicuously in a row not far from the palace.  As\nthis was understood by the people to be in connection with the\ncoronation festivities, no particular notice was taken of it.\n\nBut the result soon began to be felt, for after the festivities were\nover, and most of the settlers had retired to rest, a group of kindred\nsouls gathered round the spirit casks, and went in for what one of them\ntermed a \"regular spree.\"  At first they drank and chatted with moderate\nnoise, but as the fumes of the terrible fire-water mounted to their\nbrains they began to shout and sing, then to quarrel and fight, and,\nfinally, the wonted silence of the night was wildly disturbed by the\noaths and fiendish yells and idiotic laughter of maniacs.\n\n\"This won't do,\" said Dominick, issuing from his room in the palace, and\nmeeting the doctor.\n\n\"I had just come to the same conclusion,\" said the latter, \"and was\nabout to consult you as to what we should do.\"\n\n\"Collect some of our best men and put a stop to it,\" returned Dominick;\n\"but here comes the prime minister--roused, no doubt, as we have been.\nWhat say you, Joe; shall we attempt to quell them?\"\n\n\"Well, master, that depends.  There's a braw lot on 'em, an' if they\nbeant far gone, d'ee see, they might gie us a deal o' trouble.  If they\n_be_ far gone I'd advise ye to let 'em alone; the drink'll quell 'em\nsoon enough.  Arter that we'll know what to do.\"\n\nJust as he spoke a woman was seen rushing frantically towards them.  It\nwas little Mrs Nobbs.  Poor thing!  All her wonted merriment had fled\nfrom her comely face, and been supplanted by a look of horror.\n\n\"O sirs!\" she cried, clasping her hands, and gasping as she spoke,\n\"come, come quick, my John has falled an' broke his pledge, an' he's\ngoin' to murder some of 'em.  I _know_ he'll do it; he's got hold o' the\nfore-hammer.  Oh! come quick!\"\n\nThey required no urging.  Running down to the scene of the orgies, they\nfound that the blacksmith, who had hitherto been considered--and really\nwas--one of the quietest men of the party, was now among the drunkards.\nHe stood in the midst of the rioters, his large frame swaying to and\nfro, while he held the ponderous fore-hammer threateningly in his hands,\nand insanity gleamed in his eyes as he glared fiercely at Jabez Jenkins.\n\nOn Jabez the liquor had a different effect, his temperament being\ntotally different.  He was a rather phlegmatic man, and, having drunk\nenough to have driven two men like the blacksmith raving mad, he only\nstood before him with a dull heavy look of stupidity, mingled with an\nidiotic sneer of defiance.\n\n\"Fiend!\" shouted Nobbs, gnashing his teeth, \"you have got me to do it,\nand now I'll smash in your thick skull--I'll--\"\n\nHe stopped abruptly for a moment.  Joe Binney came up behind and gently\nlaid a hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"Come, John, you ain't agoin' to do it.  You knows you're not.\"\n\nThe quiet tone, the gentle yet fearless look, and, above all, the\nsensible, kindly expression on his friend's countenance, effectually\nsubdued the blacksmith for a few seconds, but the fury soon returned,\nthough the channel in which it flowed was changed, for Jabez was\nforgotten, having slunk away.\n\n\"Ha!\" he shouted, grasping Joe by the hand and arm, \"I've had it again!\nYou don't know how it shoots through my veins.  I--I've tried to break\nwith it, too--tried--tried!  D'ee know what it is to try, Joe, to try--\ntry--try till your blood curdles, an' your marrow boils, and your nerves\ntingle--but I gained the victory once--I--ha! ha! yes, I took the pledge\nan' kep' it, an' I've bin all right--till to-night.  My Mary knows that.\nShe'll tell you it's true--for months, and months, and months, and--but\nI'll keep it _yet_!\"\n\nHe shouted his last words in a tone of fierce defiance, let go his\nfriend, caught up the sledge-hammer, and, whirling it round his head as\nif it had been a mere toy, turned to rush towards the sea.\n\nBut Joe's strong arm arrested him.  Well did he understand the nature of\nthe awful fiend, with which the blacksmith was fighting.  The scene\nenacting was, with modifications, somewhat familiar to him, for he had\ndwelt near a great city where many a comrade had fallen in the same\nfight, never more to rise in this life.\n\nJoe's superior strength told for a moment, and he held the struggling\nmadman fast, but before Dominick and the doctor could spring to his aid,\nNobbs had burst from him.  The brief check, however, seemed to have\nchanged his intentions.  Possibly he was affected by some hazy notion\nthat it would be a quicker end to leap headlong from the neighbouring\ncliffs than to plunge into the sea.  At all events, he ran like a deer\nup towards the woods.  A bonfire, round which the revellers had made\nmerry, lay in his path.  He went straight through it, scattering the\nfirebrands right and left.  No one attempted, no one dared, to stop him,\nbut God put a check in his way.  The course he had taken brought him\nstraight up to the row of casks which stood on the other side of the\nfire, and again his wild mood was changed.  With a yell of triumph he\nbrought the sledge-hammer down on one of the casks, drove in the head,\nand overturned it with the same blow, and the liquor gushing out flowed\ninto the fire, where it went up in a magnificent roar of flame.\n\nThe effect on those of the rioters who were not too drunk to understand\nanything, was to draw forth a series of wild cheers, but high above\nthese rang the triumphant shout of the blacksmith as he gazed at the\ndestruction of his enemy.\n\nBy this time all the people in the settlement had turned out, and were\nlooking on in excitement, alarm, or horror, according to temperament.\nAmong them, of course, was the widow Lynch, who was quick to note that\nevents were taking a favourable turn.  Springing boldly to the side of\nthe smith, and, in her wild dishevelment of hair and attire, seeming a\nnot unfit companion, she cried--\n\n\"Don't spare them, John! sure there's another inimy close at yer back.\"\n\nNobbs had sense enough left to observe something of the ludicrous in the\nwoman and her advice.  He turned at once, uttered a wildly jovial laugh,\nand driving in the head of another cask, overturned it.  As before, the\nspirit rushed down the hill and was set ablaze, but the poor madman did\nnot pause now to look at the result.  His great enemy was in his power;\nhis spirit was roused.  Like one of the fabled heroes of old, he laid\nabout him with his ponderous weapon right and left until every cask was\nsmashed, and every drop of the accursed liquid was rushing down the\nhillside to the sea, or flaming out its fierce existence in the air.\n\nThe people looked on awe-stricken, and in silence, while the madman\nfought.  It was not with the senseless casks or the inanimate liquor\nthat poor John Nobbs waged war that night; it was with a real fiend who,\nin days gone by, had many a time tripped him up and laid him low, who\nhad nearly crushed the heart of his naturally cheerful little wife, who\nhad ruined his business, broken up his home, alienated his friends, and,\nfinally, driven him into exile--a fiend from whom, for many months,\nunder the influence of \"the pledge,\" he had been free, and who, he had\nfondly hoped, was quite dead.\n\nThis sudden revival of the old foe, and this unexpected surprise and\nfall, had roused this strong man's spirit to its utmost ferocity, and in\nmighty wrath he plied his hammer like a second Thor.  But the very\nstrength and nervous power of the man constituted his weakness, when\nbrought under the subtle influence of the old tempter, and it is\nprobable that on his recovery, with nerves shaken, old cravings\nawakened, and self-respect gone, he would have fallen again and again if\nGod had not made use of the paroxysm of rage to destroy the opportunity\nand the cause of evil.  Nobbs did not know at that time, though he\nlearned it afterwards, that safety from the drink-sin--as from all other\nsin--lies not in strong-man resolutions, or Temperance pledges, though\nboth are useful aids, but in Jesus, the Saviour _from sin_.\n\nSome of those who witnessed the wholesale destruction of the liquor\nwould fain have made an effort to prevent it; but, fortunately for the\ncommunity, most of them were too drunk to care, and the others to\ninterfere; while all were so taken by surprise that the deed was done\nand the grand conflagration ended before they had realised the full\nsignificance of the blacksmith's act.\n\nWhen the last head had been driven in, and the last gallon of spirit\nsummarily dismissed by the fire, Nobbs threw up his arms, and, looking\nupward, gave vent to a cheer which ended in a prolonged cry.  For a\nmoment he stood thus, then the hammer dropt from his grasp, and he fell\nback insensible.\n\nPoor little Mrs Nobbs was by his side on her knees in a moment, parting\nthe dark hair from his broad brow, kissing his swart cheeks, and chafing\nhis strong hands.\n\n\"O John! darling John!\" she cried, \"come back--come back--don't die.\nYou never was hard or cruel to _me_!  Even the drink could not do that.\nCome back, John!\"\n\nDr Marsh here gently restrained her.  \"Don't be alarmed,\" he said, as\nhe undid the smith's necktie; \"he'll be all right presently.  Stand\nback, don't crowd round him; and you go fetch a cup of water, Mrs\nNobbs.\"\n\nThe reassuring tones and the necessity for action did much to calm the\nexcited woman.  Before she had returned with the water her husband had\npartially recovered.  They carried him to his hut, and left him to sleep\noff the effects, while his poor little wife watched by his side.  When\nleft quite alone, she went down on her knees beside him, and prayed for\nhis deliverance with all her heart.  Then she rose and sat down with a\ncalm, contented look, muttering, \"Yes; He _is_ the hearer and answerer\nof prayer.  He _will_ answer me.\"\n\nShe might have gone further and said, \"He _has_ answered me,\" for was\nnot the destruction of the liquor an answer to the petition before it\nwas put up?  \"Before they call I will answer.\"\n\n\"Pina,\" said Otto the following day, in a tone almost of reproach,\nduring a private audience with the queen, \"Pina, how came you to do such\nan insane thing as choose Joe Binney for your premier?  Why didn't you\nchoose Dom?  You know well enough that he's fifty times cleverer than\nJoe, and even in the matter of strength, though he's not so strong, I'm\nvery sure that with his pugilistic powers he could keep order quite as\nwell.  Besides, all the people had made up their minds, as a matter of\ncourse, that Dom was to be premier, and then--he's a gentleman.\"\n\n\"I'm thankful that you are not one of the Privy Council, Otto,\" returned\nPauline, with a laugh.  \"You put several questions, and a string of\ncommentary and suggestion in the same breath!  Let me answer you in\ndetail, beginning with your last remark.  Joe is a gentleman in the\nhighest sense of that word.  He is gentle as a lamb by nature, and a\n_man_ every inch of him.  But, more than this, I have noticed that he is\na peculiarly wise man, with a calm, pool head on all occasions, and not\ntoo ready to use his great physical power in the settlement of disputes.\nI have observed, too, that when asked for his advice, he usually thinks\nwell before he gives it, and when his advice is followed things almost\nalways go well.  Still further, Joe has the thorough confidence of the\npeople, and I am not so sure that Dom has.  Besides, if I had appointed\nDom, some of the ungenerous among them might have said it was done from\nmere favouritism.  Then as to the people making up their minds that I\nwould appoint Dom,\" continued Pauline, \"what have I to do with _that_?\"\n\n\"Why, everything to do with it,\" returned Otto, with a surprised look.\n\"Were you not made queen for the purpose of carrying out their wishes?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" answered Pauline; \"I was made queen for the purpose of\nruling.  They told me they had confidence in my judgment, not in my\nreadiness to carry out their wishes.  If my judgment, coupled with that\nof my advisers, does not suit them, it is open to them to unmake me as\nthey made me, and appoint a king or a president, but my judgment I\ncannot alter.\"\n\nOtto listened to these gravely stated opinions of the new queen with\nincreasing astonishment.\n\n\"Then, you awful despot,\" he said, \"do you mean to tell me that you are\ngoing to have no regard for the will of the people?\"\n\n\"No, I don't mean to tell you that, you presumptuous little subject.  I\nintend always to have the utmost regard for the will of my people, and\nto weigh it well, and consult with my advisers about it; and when our\nunited judgment says that their will is good, I will act in accordance\nwith it; when we think it bad, I will reject it.  I have been made queen\nto rule, and I _mean_ to rule!  That's fair, isn't it?  If they don't\nlike my ruling they can dethrone me.  That's also fair, isn't it?  You\nwouldn't have me become a mere puppet--a jumping Jack or Jinnie--would\nyou, for the people to pull the string of?\"\n\n\"Well, I never!\" exclaimed Otto, gazing with distended eyes at the soft\nfair face and at the pretty little innocent mouth that gave vent to\nthese vigorous sentiments.  \"And what may it be your majesty's pleasure\nto do next?\"\n\n\"It is my pleasure that you, sir, shall go down to the beach and prepare\nthe dinghy for immediate service.  I have already directed the prime\nminister, in conjunction with Dom and our Court physician, to draw up a\nconstitution and code of laws; while they are thus employed you and I\nwill go a-fishing.\"\n\n\"Very good; I suppose I'm bound to obey, but I thought your majesty\npreferred to go a-sketching.\"\n\n\"We will do both.  Be off, sirrah!\"\n\nOtto was not long in launching and getting ready the little punt, or\ndinghy, belonging to the wreck, which, being too small for carrying\ngoods to the island, had been made over to Pauline as a royal barge for\nher special amusement, and already had she and her little brother\nenjoyed several charming expeditions among the sheltered islets of the\nlagoon, when Otto devoted himself chiefly to rowing and fishing, while\nhis sister sketched with pencil and water-colours.  Being expert with\nboth, she took great pleasure therein.\n\n\"It _is_ so pleasant and so very engrossing,\" she murmured, busying\nherself with a sketch of Otto as he rowed gently towards one of the\nsmaller islets.  \"I can't tell you how much I delight--turn your head a\nlittle more to the left--so--and do keep your nose quiet if you can.\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" said Otto.  \"There's a little fly that has made up its\nmind to go into my nose.  I can neither drive it away nor catch it while\nboth hands are engaged with the oars, so there's no resource left but to\nscrew my nose about.  But what were you going to say you delighted in?\"\n\n\"In--in drawing,\" replied the queen very slowly, while her pretty little\nhead went up and down as she glanced alternately at her sitter and the\nsketch-book on her knee; \"it--it takes one's mind--so--off--\"\n\n\"The cares of state?\" said Otto.  \"Yes, I can easily understand what\na-re-re-ha! hk-sh!\" he gave way to a convulsive sneeze; \"there, it went\nup at last, and that little fly's doom is sealed!\"\n\n\"I should think it was,\" said Pauline laughingly.  \"To be blown from a\ncannon's mouth must be nothing to that.  Now, do keep still, just for\none minute.\"\n\nFor considerably more than a minute she went on sketching busily, while\nher brother pulled along very gently, as if unwilling to break the\npleasant silence.  Everything around was calculated to foster a dreamy,\nlanguid, peaceful state of mind.  The weather was pleasantly cool--just\ncool enough to render the brilliant sunshine most enjoyable.  Not a\nzephyr disturbed the glassy surface of the sea outside or the lagoon\nwithin, or broke the perfect reflections of the islets among which they\nmoved.  The silence would have been even oppressive had it not been for\nthe soft, plaintive cries of wildfowl and the occasional whistling of\nwings as they hurried to and fro, and the solemn boom of the great\nbreakers as they fell at slow regular intervals on the reef.  \"Doesn't\nit sound,\" said Pauline, looking up from her sketch with a flush of\ndelight, \"like the deep soft voice of the ocean speaking peace to all\nmankind?\"\n\n\"What, the breakers?\" asked Otto.\n\n\"Yes, dropping with a soft deep roar as they do in the midst of the\nuniversal silence.\"\n\n\"Well, it doesn't quite strike me in that light, Pina.  My imagination\nisn't so lively as yours.  Seems to me more like the snoring of a\nsleeping giant, whom it is best to let lie still like a sleeping dog,\nfor he's apt to do considerable damage when roused.\"\n\nThe soft influences around soon reduced the pair to silence again.\nAfter a time it was broken by Pauline.\n\n\"What are you thinking of, Otto?\"\n\n\"I was thinking, your majesty, that it seems unfair, after making Joe\nprime minister, Dom a privy councillor, the doctor Court physician and\ngeneral humbug, that you should give me no definite position in the\nroyal household.\"\n\n\"What would you say to being commander of the forces?\" asked Pauline\ndreamily, as she put in a few finishing touches, \"for then, you see, you\nmight adopt the title which you have unfairly bestowed on the doctor--\nGeneral Humbug.\"\n\nOtto shook his head.  \"Wouldn't do, my dear queen.  Not being a correct\ndescription, your bestowing it would compromise your majesty's\nwell-known character for truthfulness.  What d'you say to make me a\npage--page in waiting?\"\n\n\"You'll have to turn over a new leaf if I do, for a page is supposed to\nbe quiet, respectful, polite, obedient, ready--\"\n\n\"No use to go further, Pina.  I'm not cut out for a page.  Will you land\non this islet?\"\n\nThey were gliding softly past one of the most picturesque and verdant\ngems of the lagoon at the time.\n\n\"No, I've taken a fancy to make a sketch from that one nearer to the\nshore of Big Island.  You see, there is not only a very picturesque\ngroup of trees on it just at that place, but the background happens to\nbe filled up by a distant view of the prettiest part of our settlement,\nwhere Joe Binney's garden lies, close to Mrs Lynch's garden, with its\nwonderfully shaped and curious hut, (no wonder, built by herself!) and a\ncorner of the palace rising just behind the new schoolhouse.\"\n\n\"Mind your eye, queen, else you go souse overboard when we strike,\" said\nOtto, not without reason, for next moment the dinghy's keel grated on\nthe sand of the islet, and Pauline, having risen in her eagerness to go\nto work, almost fulfilled the boy's prediction.\n\n\"But tell me, Pina, what do you mean to do with that schoolhouse when it\nis built?\" asked Otto, as he walked beside his sister to the picturesque\nspot above referred to.\n\n\"To teach in it, of course.\"\n\n\"What--yourself?\"\n\n\"Well, yes, to some extent.  Of course I cannot do much in that way--\"\n\n\"I understand--the affairs of state!\" said Otto, \"will not permit,\netcetera.\"\n\n\"Put it so if you please,\" returned Pauline, laughing.  \"Here, sit down;\nhelp me to arrange my things, and I'll explain.  You cannot fail to have\nbeen impressed with the fact that the children of the settlers are\ndreadfully ignorant.\"\n\n\"H'm!  I suppose you are right; but I have been more deeply impressed\nwith the fact that they are dreadfully dirty, and desperately\nquarrelsome, and deplorably mischievous.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" resumed Pauline.  \"Now, I intend to get your friend Redding,\nwho was once a schoolmaster, to take these children in hand when the\nschoolroom is finished, and teach them what he can, superintended by Dr\nMarsh, who volunteered his services the moment I mentioned the school.\nIn the evenings I will take the mothers in hand, and teach them their\nduties to their children and the community--\"\n\n\"Being yourself such an old and experienced mother,\" said Otto.\n\n\"Silence, sir! you ought to remember that we have a dear, darling mother\nat home, whose character is engraven on my memory, and whom I can hold\nup as a model.\"\n\n\"True, Pina!  The dear old mother!\" returned Otto, a burst of\nhome-feeling interfering for a moment with his levity.  \"Just you paint\nher portrait fair and true, and if they come anything within a hundred\nmiles o' the mark yours will be a kingd---queendom, I mean--of amazin'\nmothers.  I sometimes fear,\" continued the boy, becoming grave, \"it may\nbe a long time before we set eyes on mother again.\"\n\n\"I used to fear the same,\" said Pauline, \"but I have become more hopeful\non that point since Dr Marsh said he was determined to have a small\nschooner built out of the wreck, and attempt with a few sailors to reach\nEngland in her, and report our condition here.\"\n\n\"Why, that would do you out of your kingdom, Pina!\"\n\n\"It does not follow.  And what if it did?\"\n\n\"It would be a pity.  Not pleasant you know, to be dethroned.  But to\nreturn to mother.  D'you think the old cat will have learned to speak by\nthis time?\"\n\nTo this Pauline replied that she feared not; that, although the cat\nmight have mastered the consonants, it could never have managed the\nvowels.  \"Dear mother,\" she added, in a more earnest tone, \"I am quite\nsure that though the cat may not speak to her, she will not have ceased\nto speak to the cat.  Now, go away, Otto, you're beginning to make me\ntalk nonsense.\"\n\n\"But what about the schoolhouse?\" persisted the boy, while the girl\nbegan to sketch the view.  \"You have not finished that subject.\"\n\n\"True--well, besides teaching the mothers I have great hopes of inducing\nDom to set up a Sunday-school, in which those who feel inclined might be\ntaught out of the Bible, and that might in time lead to our making a\nchurch of it on Sundays, and having regular services, for there are some\nearnest Christians among the men, who I feel quite sure would be ready\nto help in the work.  Then as to an army--\"\n\n\"An army!\" echoed Otto, \"what do we want with an army? who have we to\nfight against?\"\n\nLittle did Otto or Pauline think that at the very time they were\nconversing thus pleasantly on that beautiful islet, the presence of a\nfriendly army was urgently required, for there in the bushes close\nbehind them listening to every sentence, but understanding never a word,\nlay a group of tattooed and armed savages!\n\nIn the prosecution of evil designs, the nature of which was best known\nto themselves, these savages had arrived at Refuge Islands the night\nbefore.  Instantly they became aware of the presence of the white men,\nand took measures to observe them closely without being themselves\nobserved.  Carrying their war-canoe over the reef in the dark, and\nlaunching it on the lagoon, they advanced as near to the settlement as\npossible, landed a small party on an islet, and then retired with the\ncanoe.  It was this party which lay in ambush so near to our little hero\nand heroine.  They had been watching the settlers since daybreak, and\nwere not a little surprised, as well as gratified, by the unexpected\narrival of the little boat.\n\nThe savage who lay there grinning like a Cheshire cat, and peeping\nthrough the long grass not ten feet from where the brother and sister\nsat, was a huge man, tattooed all over, so that his face resembled\ncarved mahogany, his most prominent feature being a great flat nose,\nwith a blue spot on the point of it.\n\nSuddenly Otto caught sight of the glitter of this man's eyes and teeth.\n\nNow, the power of self-restraint was a prominent feature in Otto's\ncharacter, at least in circumstances of danger, though in the matter of\nfun and mischief he was rather weak.  No sign did Otto give of his\ndiscovery, although his heart seemed to jump into his mouth.  He did not\neven check or alter the tone of his conversation, but he changed the\nsubject with surprising abruptness.  He had brought up one of the\ndinghy's oars on his shoulder as a sort of plaything or vaulting-pole.\nSuddenly, asking Pauline if she had ever seen him balance an oar on his\nchin, he proceeded to perform the feat, much to her amusement.  In doing\nso he turned his back completely on the savage in ambush, whose cattish\ngrin increased as the boy staggered about.\n\nBut there was purpose in Otto's staggering.  He gradually lessened the\ndistance between himself and the savage.  When near enough for his\npurpose, he grasped the oar with both hands, wheeled sharply round, and\nbrought the heavy handle of it down with such a whack on the bridge of\nthe savage's blue-spotted nose that he suddenly ceased to grin, and\ndropped his proboscis in the dust!\n\nAt the same instant, to the horror and surprise of the brother and\nsister, up sprang half a dozen hideous natives, who seized them, placed\ntheir black hands on their mouths, and bore them swiftly away.  The\nwar-canoe, putting off from its concealment, received the party along\nwith the fallen leader, and made for the reef.\n\nHigh on the cliffs of Big Island Dr John Marsh had been smilingly\nwatching the proceedings of the queen and her brother in the dinghy.\nWhen he witnessed the last act of the play, however, the smile vanished.\nWith a bound that would have done credit to a kangaroo, and a roar that\nwould have shamed a lion, he sprang over the cliffs, ran towards the\nbeach, and was followed--yelling--by all the men at hand--some armed,\nand some not.  They leaped into the largest boat on the shore, put out\nthe ten oars, bent to them with a will, and skimmed over the lagoon in\nfierce pursuit.\n\nSoon the savages gained the reef, carried their canoe swiftly over, and\nlaunched on the open sea, cutting through the great rollers like a\nrocket or a fish-torpedo.\n\nHeavy timbers and stout planks could not be treated thus; nevertheless,\nthe white men were so wild and strong, that when the boat finally gained\nthe open sea it was not very far behind the canoe.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TEN.\n\nDESCRIBES A RESCUE, A CONSPIRACY, AND A TRIAL.\n\nProverbially a stern chase is a long one.  Happily, there are exceptions\nto proverbs as well as rules.  The chase of the war-canoe, however, with\nthe captured queen on board, did not promise to be exceptional at first,\nfor the canoe was light and sharp, and powerfully manned, so that the\nsavages could relieve each other frequently, whereas the settlers' boat\nwas heavy and blunt, and not by any means too full of men.  It soon\nbecame apparent that the latter was no match for the former under oars.\nThe distance between the two visibly increased.\n\nDr Marsh steered.  He was deadly pale, and there was a peculiarly\nintense expression of anxiety in the steady gaze, with which he watched\nthe ever-diminishing canoe.\n\n\"No chance?\" muttered Jabez Jenkins, who happened to form one of the\ncrew and pulled the bow oar.\n\n\"No chance?\" repeated Dominick, who also pulled one of the oars.\n\"There's _every_ chance.  We're sure to tire them out.  Ho! lads, give\nway with a will!\"\n\nAlthough labouring already with all his might, indignation at Jenkins's\nremark enabled him to put on a spurt, which the others imitated.  Still\nthe distance between boat and canoe increased.\n\n\"They are three to one,\" growled Malines, who, up to that time, had been\ndoing his best.\n\n\"Silence!\" thundered the doctor, drawing a revolver from his pocket and\ncocking it.\n\nBeads of perspiration stood on the doctor's brow, and there was\nsomething so terrible in the look of his white face that no one ventured\nto utter another word, but all pulled as if for their lives.\n\nFor some minutes no sound was heard save the regular rattle of the oars\nin the rowlocks, the swish of the foam as it flew from the cutwater, and\nthe occasional sob or gasp of the men as they exerted themselves to the\nutmost limit of their powers in the hopeless pursuit.\n\nSuddenly Teddy Malone cried eagerly, \"Look out--astarn!\"\n\nAll turned their gaze as directed, and observed a dark line on the\nhorizon.\n\n\"Thank God!\" murmured the doctor, \"a breeze!\"\n\nIt was indeed true.  Just at this critical moment of profound, despair,\na gleam of hope was sent to sustain them!  Is it not often thus in the\ndealings of God with man?\n\nThere was no relaxation of effort, however, on the part of the crew\nuntil the breeze bore down on them.  Then the mate and Hugh Morrison,\ndrawing in their oars, set up the mast and hoisted the sails.  Instantly\nthe good craft bent over, as if bowing submissively to her rightful\nlord, and the gurgling water rolled swiftly from her prow.  Still the\nmen plied the oars, but now with the strength of hope, until the breeze\nfreshened so much as to render their further use unnecessary.\n\n\"Now, indeed, the tables are turned,\" said Dominick with a great sigh of\nrelief, as he drew in his oar.\n\n\"Yes; if the wind holds,\" said the doctor, glancing back anxiously.\n\n\"It'll howld,\" said Malone firmly.\n\n\"Who made you so sure a judge of weather?\" demanded Jenkins.\n\n\"Sure it isn't me as is judge.  It's the widdy.  She says to me this\nmornin', says she, `The'll be a stiff breeze afore night, Teddy,' an' I\nnivver found the widdy wrong in her forecasts o' the weather.\"\n\n\"The distance decreases rapidly!  Hurrah! boys, we'll catch them yet,\"\ncried Dominick.\n\nThis was obviously the case.  With her large sails filled by a stiff\nbreeze almost directly astern, the boat went through the water like \"a\nthing of life.\"  The savages, perceiving this, redoubled their efforts,\nbut in vain.  The pursuers gained on them rapidly.\n\nAn exclamation of surprise burst from those in the boat as they observed\ntwo splashes, one on either side of the canoe, as if some one had fallen\nor leaped overboard.  A great shout from the savages followed, and they\nsuddenly ceased to paddle.  The canoe was still too far off for the\npursuers to make out what had occurred; but in another minute they\nobserved that two round black objects emerged from the water some\ndistance astern of the canoe.  The savages also saw these, and uttered a\nfrightful yell as they backed their craft towards them.\n\n\"They've jumped overboard!\" exclaimed Dominick.  \"Now, boys--ready with\nyour guns!\"\n\nNo need for this order.  All were ready in a second, but none dared to\nfire for fear of hitting the swimmers.\n\nJust then a savage rose in the stern of the canoe and poised a short\nspear.\n\nInstantly every gun in the boat was pointed.\n\n\"Not a shot!\" shouted Dr Marsh, as he sprang forward with a\ndouble-barrelled rifle in his hand.\n\n\"Keep her away two points!\" he cried, as he knelt to take aim.  Every\none was well aware of the doctor's power of shooting, and waited the\nresult with bated breath.  The savage seemed to bend backward for the\ncast of the spear.  At that moment the crack of the doctor's rifle was\nheard, and the right arm of the savage fell.\n\nAnother savage caught up the spear, and urged his comrades, apparently,\nto back the canoe still further; but they had got a fright, and were\nevidently unwilling to do so.  Before they could make up their minds,\nanother shot from the doctor's rifle sent the second savage headlong\ninto the bottom of the canoe.\n\n\"Give them a volley now, lads,\" he said, turning round and resuming his\nplace at the helm; \"but fire high.\"\n\nThe rattling volley which followed, and the whistle of the leaden hail\nover their heads, quickly settled the savage minds.  One of their\npaddles, which chanced to be held aloft at the moment, was shot into\nsplinters, and precipitated their decision.  With a howl of rage and\nterror they dipped their paddles into the sea and flew ahead.\n\n\"Be ready there,\" cried the doctor, as he anxiously guided the boat.\n\nTeddy Malone, Morris, Dominick, and Jabez leaned eagerly over the bows\nwith outstretched arms and clawlike fingers.  Another moment and Queen\nPina with Otto were rescued from the deep, as well as from several\nsharks, which, doubtless, had been licking their lips at the prospect of\nthe royal feast in store for them.\n\n\"Ain't you goin' to carry on, an' sink the varmints?\" exclaimed Jabez in\nsurprise, as the doctor put the helm hard down, and prepared to return\nhome.\n\n\"No,\" replied the doctor sharply.\n\nDuring the voyage out the crew of the wrecked ship had become intimately\nacquainted with the doctor's qualities, among others that there was a\ncertain quiet tone in his \"no\" which was final.  To put the belligerents\nof the party more at rest, however, Dominick backed his friend up by\nadding that he had no ill-will to the miserable savages; that they had\nbeen punished enough already; that they had got all they wanted from\nthem; and that as their own party consisted chiefly of settlers, not\nwarriors, there was no occasion for fighting.\n\n\"Speak for yourself, Dom,\" cried Otto, as he wrung the water out of his\ngarments.  \"If I was in that canoe with a good carving-knife, I'd be\nwarrior enough to give a settler to the baboon wi' the swelled nose who\ncrammed me into a--\"\n\nThe remainder of the speech was drowned in laughter, for Otto spoke with\nintense indignation, as he thought of the injuries and indignities he\nhad so recently suffered.\n\n\"Why, what did they do to you, Otto?\" asked his brother.\n\n\"Oh!  I can't tell you,\" replied the other; \"I'm too mad.  Tell 'em,\nPina.\"\n\nQueen Pina, who had also been engaged for some minutes in wringing the\nwater from her skirts, sat down, and, in the sweetest of voices, told\nhow they had been surprised on the islet, how Otto had flattened a\nchief's nose with an oar, and how they had afterwards been carried off.\n\n\"Then,\" she added, \"when they saw that you were unable to overtake them,\nthe chief with the swelled nose began to beat poor Otto and pull his\nhair savagely.  I do believe he would have killed him if a man, who\nseemed to be the leader of them all, had not ordered him to desist.\nWhen you put up the sail and began to overtake us, the chief with the\nswelled nose got out a rough kind of sack and tried to thrust Otto into\nit.  While he was struggling with this chief--\"\n\n\"Fighting,\" interrupted Otto; \"fighting with the baboon.\"\n\n\"Well, fighting, if you prefer it--he asked me if I was brave?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't; I said game.\"\n\n\"Well--if I was game to jump overboard at the same moment that he did?\nI quickly said yes.  He twisted himself out of the man's--\"\n\n\"Baboon's! baboon's!\"\n\n\"Well--baboon's grasp, and went over the side like an eel, and--\"\n\n\"And she,\" interrupted Otto, \"she went plump on the other side like a\nsack of potatoes, and we met under the canoe and dived well astern\nbefore coming up for breath.  You know what pains you took with our\nswimming and diving, Dom; it helped us then, I can tell you; and so here\nwe are, all alive and hearty.  But I saw the black fellow goin' to send\na spear at Pina, and can't think why he didn't let fly.  P'r'aps he did,\nand missed.\"\n\n\"No, he didn't; for Dr Marsh shot him in the arm,\" said Dominick, \"and\nthus saved Pauline's life.\"\n\n\"Three cheers for the Queen!\" cried little Buxley, who had done good\nservice at the oar, and whose little bosom was filled with enthusiasm at\nthe recital of this adventure.\n\nThe invitation was heartily responded to.\n\n\"An' wan more for the doctor!\" shouted Malone.\n\nIn this rejoicing frame of mind they returned to Big Island, where\nPauline was received with a warm embrace by the widow Lynch, who had\nbeen dancing about the settlement in a more or less deranged state ever\nsince the boat left.\n\nThat same evening two meetings of considerable importance took place in\nthe palace.  The first was a cabinet council in the hall; the other a\nmeeting of conspirators in the back-kitchen.  Both were brief, for each\nwas interrupted.  We will take the cabinet council first.\n\nThe ministers present at it were the premier, Dominick and Dr Marsh,\nboth of whom Joe had called to his aid.\n\n\"Now, my dear queen,\" said the premier, \"we have met to consider the\nconstitution; but before saying a word about it myself, I would like to\nhear what your majesty has to say about it.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" said the queen gravely, \"that I have the faintest notion\nas to how a constitution should begin or end.  But I will give you a\nmotto to set in the forefront of our constitution, which may also form\nthe foundation on which it is to be built--the pattern to which its\nparts must conform.  It is this: `Whatsoever ye would that men should do\nto you, do ye even so to them.'\"\n\n\"I will set that down with pleasure,\" said Dominick, who acted as clerk,\nbut, before he could write a line, a knock at the door interrupted them.\nThen the door opened, and Otto's head appeared with eagerness in the\neyes, and a beckoning hand in advance.\n\nDominick rose and went out.\n\n\"I've just overheard Morris and Jabez in the back-kitchen making an\nappointment.  Shall I tell our squad to be ready?\"\n\n\"Where is the appointed place?\" asked Dominick.\n\n\"On the reef.  They start this very night, for the wind suits, and I\nheard Hugh say that all was ready.\"\n\n\"Good!  I didn't think the game was so nearly played out.  Well for us\nthat we are prepared.  Yes, call up the squad.  We'll give them\ncheckmate to-night.\"\n\nIt must be explained here that ever since the night of the discovery of\nthe plot organised by Morris to seize and carry off the wrecked ship,\nOtto and his brother had kept a close watch on the men, and were aware\nof all their plans and intended movements.  They had also communicated\ntheir knowledge to a select few, whom Otto styled the squad, who had\npledged themselves to be ready at a moment's notice to do their best to\ncircumvent the conspirators.  Among other things Otto had discovered\nthat Malines had agreed to join them, professing himself quite willing\nto act as second in command under Morris.\n\nIt may also be explained that though we have hitherto spoken of the\nvessel which had been cast on the reef as a wreck, it was in reality\nvery slightly injured about the hull, and much of the damage done to the\nspars and rigging had been quietly repaired by the conspirators.\n\nWhen darkness shrouded land and sea, two expeditions started from the\nsettlement that night--one following the other.  The conspirators in the\nlargest boat set off first.  As it was no unusual thing for a night\nexpedition to the reef in order to transport supplies from the wreck in\nthe morning, the departure of the large boat attracted little notice.\n\nWhen it had got well away a smaller boat set off, containing the\n\"squad,\" which numbered among its members Dominick, the doctor, Otto,\nJoe, and his brother David, Teddy Malone, little Buxley, John Nobbs the\nblacksmith, and others, all of whom were armed with revolvers.\n\nThey steered for a different part of the reef, so as to avoid being seen\nby the conspirators.  On landing they passed through the old\nburial-ground and made for the Golden Cave.  This place had, since the\nsettlement on Big Island, been given over entirely to Pauline's use, and\nbeing styled the Queen's seaside palace, no one ever thought of entering\nit without permission.  Hence the party of observation knew that it\nwould be a secure place of ambush.\n\nWhen safe inside, Dominick and Otto were deputed to go out as quietly as\npossible, note what Morris and his men were doing, and bring back a\nreport.\n\n\"For,\" said the doctor, \"if we interrupt them too soon they may pretend\nthat this is one of their ordinary visits to the ship for supplies, and\nif we are too late they may get clear away in spite of us.  We must\nstrike when the iron is hot.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Otto, looking back as he followed his brother, \"we'll look\nwell to the heating process and let you know when they're white hot, so\nhave your revolvers ready, my braves!\"\n\n\"Och! shut your tatie-trap,\" cried Malone, but Otto, having shut the\ndoor, lost the advice.\n\nThe night was neither decidedly light nor dark.  There might, indeed, to\nhave been moonlight, but clouds veiled the light though they could not\naltogether obscure it; thus there was just enough to render objects\ndimly visible.\n\n\"All the better,\" whispered Dominick, as they turned the point of rock\nthat hid the wreck from view.  \"We'll go down by the thicket.  Keep\nclose to my heels, boy, and drop on your hands and knees when you see me\ndo so.\"\n\n\"All right, captain.\"\n\nGliding cautiously down in the direction indicated, they came at length\nto the seaward edge of the thicket, where the bushes, being less dense,\npermitted them to partially see the wreck.  Here Dominick went on\nall-fours, appearing, as he crept slowly forward, like some sort of huge\nbear with no tail, and its hind feet turned the wrong way.  Otto\nfollowed like a little bear with similar undignified peculiarities.\nHaving advanced far enough to obtain a clear view of the wreck, the\nspies sank into the grass and crept forward a little way.  Then they lay\nstill a few moments and listened.  They then raised their heads\ncautiously and looked.  What they heard and saw puzzled them not a\nlittle.\n\nFirst, they noted that the wreck did not seem to lie in the position,\nwith which they had been so long familiar.  Then, as their eyes became\naccustomed to the faint light, they observed that a small boat was\nmoving busily about the vessel's bow, and that a group of dark\nscarce-distinguishable forms of men was standing on the shore.\nPresently there was heard a low, yet not unfamiliar growl.  This was\nfollowed by a high yet not unfamiliar shriek, accompanied by a grating\nsound.\n\n\"Lions and cockatoos!\" whispered Otto, who had crept up alongside of his\nbrother by that time, \"what _can_ they be about?\"\n\n\"Is that a line I see athwart the sky?\" asked Dominick, \"look--just\nbetween the wreck and the big ledge there.\"\n\nSaid Otto, \"It's more than a line.  _I_ see it.  Half a dozen lines at\nleast, and something like a round lump in the middle of 'em.  Don't you\nsee it?--against the sky like a black moon--\"\n\n\"Hush! boy--the growl again!\"\n\n\"Ay, man, also the cockatoo.\"\n\n\"Oh!  I have it now,\" whispered Dominick, with a low laugh; \"they've\nrove blocks and tackle from the ship to the rocks, and are working them\nsoftly.  Evildoers fear to be overheard, even when there's no chance of\nbeing so!  Your lion, Otto, is the subdued yo-heave-ho of the men.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Otto, with a grin so broad that his white teeth glistened\neven in the dark, \"and my cockatoo is the unsubdued screeching of the\nblock-sheaves!  They must be trying to get the ship off the reef.\"\n\nA heavy plunge at that moment told that the conspirators were not only\ntrying but had succeeded, for the plunge was followed by an irresistible\nthough powerfully suppressed cheer.\n\n\"We have not a moment to lose, Otto,\" whispered Dominick.  \"The ship is\nfree, and they will only take time to carry the tackle aboard before\nembarking.  Do you run back and bring the squad down at the double.  I\nwill keep our friends here in play till they come.\"\n\nNot a word did Otto reply.  He had acquired that first of requisites in\na soldier or servant--the habit of prompt obedience.  Somewhat like a\nNorth American savage, he sank into the grass and wriggled from the\nscene.  A few moments later Dominick rose, and walked down towards the\nconspirators with the easy off-hand manner of a man who saunters forth\nto enjoy the night air.  So busy were they getting the tackle into the\nboat that he was not observed until quite close to them.\n\n\"You seem busy to-night, friends,\" he said, in his usual pleasant tones,\nas he took his stand close beside Hugh Morris, who was near the bow of\nthe boat.\n\n\"Mr Rigonda!\" exclaimed Malines in great surprise, coming forward at\nthe moment.\n\n\"Why are you surprised?  It is not unusual for me to take a row on a\nfine night.\"\n\nThis reply seeming to imply that Dominick had come to the reef alone--\nperhaps in the dinghy--emboldened the men; some of them laughed.\n\n\"Well, I confess to being a little surprised, sir,\" replied the mate,\n\"for it so happened that we were preparing something in the nature of a\nsurprise for you and the rest of the settlers.\"\n\n\"Yes, I see,\" returned Dominick, in the same pleasant tone.  \"You've\nmanaged to get the ship off the ledge in a very creditable manner, and\nyou mean to take her into the lagoon and cast anchor off the\nsettlement?\"\n\nAgain the men laughed lightly.\n\n\"No, sir, we don't,\" broke in Hugh Morris at this point, \"we intend to\ntake her in quite the opposite direction, and clear off to sea with\nher.\"\n\n\"Oh no, you don't, Hugh,\" returned Dominick, with an agreeable smile,\nwhich was a little perplexing as well as exasperating.  \"You are going\ninto the lagoon; you know you are, and I have come to help you.\"\n\n\"But I say we are _not_!\" retorted Morris, in rising wrath, \"and what's\nmore, you'll have to go along with us, now that you've had the ill-luck\nto fall in with us.\"\n\n\"Quite right, Hugh; didn't I _say_ that I came off on purpose to go\nalong with you?\"\n\nAs he spoke there was heard a rushing sound of feet and a number of dark\nforms were seen approaching from the bushes.\n\n\"Betrayed!\" shouted Malines.  \"Jump in, lads, and shove off!\"\n\nHe sprang forward, but was instantly arrested by the muzzle of a\nrevolver within a foot of his head.\n\n\"It's of no use, boys,\" said Dominick, laying his hand on the bow of the\nboat.  \"You'll have to enter it as dead men if you do so without my\npermission.\"\n\nHad the men been armed it might have gone hard with Dominick at that\nmoment, but so sure had they been of accomplishing their purpose\nunmolested, that the idea of arming had never crossed their minds.\nBefore they could recover from the surprise or decide what to do, the\narmed squad was upon them.\n\n\"Halt! boys,\" cried Joe Binney, when close to the boat.  \"Now, look 'ee\nhere.  It warn't o' my seekin' that I was made prime minister, but now\nthat it's bin done I'll stick to it an' do my duty.  If ye knock under\nlike good boys I'll recommend ye to the queen's marcy.  If not I'll have\n'ee strung up, every man jack of 'ee.  Moreover, the first man as\ndisobeys my orders I'll blow his brains out.  Now, jump aboard, boys\n(turning to his own men), an' keep your revolvers handy.  You lads as\nwanted to run away will follow.\"\n\nThe mixture of humour and resolution in Joe's manner, coupled with his\nwell-known decision of character and his commanding size, had its\neffect.  The squad instantly jumped into the boat, and the conspirators\nmeekly followed without a word.  They saw--as Hugh afterwards expressed\nit--that the game was up, and made up their minds to submit to the\ninevitable.\n\nThe conspirators were ordered to take the oars.  Afterwards they were\nmade to work the ship round into the channel leading to the lagoon,\nwhile their armed friends mounted guard over them.\n\nIt was daybreak when the ship sailed calmly over the lagoon towards\nSilver Bay.\n\n\"Och! man,\" said Teddy Malone, in a low voice, to Jabez Jenkins, who\nstood near him, \"why did ye want to run away wid the owld ship?  It wor\na sneakin' sort o' thing, warn't it, seein' that the poor little\nchilders, an' the women, depind so much on what's inside of her?\"\n\n\"To tell 'ee the truth, Teddy,\" replied the man, an improved expression\ncoming suddenly over his face, \"I ain't sorry that we've bin stopped in\nthis business, and, wot's more, I believe that most of us ain't sorry.\nWe was more than half led into it, d'ee see, by lies as to what the\nleaders was goin' to do, an' arterwards we didn't like to draw back.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry for yez,\" returned Malone, \"for I'm afeared we'll have to\nskrag the wan half of ye to keep the other half in order.  In a spik an'\nspan noo settlement, where ivvery wan thinks he may do as he likes, the\nlaws has to be pritty stiff.  We've wan comfort, howivver--the quane is\nmarciful.\"\n\nThe Irishman was right in both his views on this subject, as the sequel\nwill show.\n\nGreat was the surprise and joy among the settlers that morning when the\nfine ship in which they had traversed the ocean sailed grandly over the\nlagoon, and let go her anchor in Silver Bay.  Some viewed her as a means\nof continuing the voyage, and escaping from a secluded life, of which\nthey were beginning to tire.  Others thought of her as a means of\nreopening intercourse with home, while not a few thought only of the\nconvenience of having her and her useful cargo so near to them.\n\nBut great was their surprise when Malines, Morris, Jabez, and the rest\nof them were landed with their hands bound behind their backs; and still\ngreater was that surprise when, in open court, that is, in the midst of\nthe entire colony in the open air, these men were charged with their\ncrime.\n\nA regular criminal court was instituted on the spot, as regular, at\nleast, as was possible, considering the almost total ignorance of all\nconcerned in regard to matters of law.  Queen Pauline appointed Dr\nMarsh to be judge, he being supposed to be the best acquainted with, or\nleast ignorant of, legal matters and forms.  A jury of twelve men were\nselected by lot, and little Buxley was appointed public prosecutor.  In\njustice to the prisoners it was thought that they ought to have an\nadvocate to defend them, but as no one would undertake the duty, that\nalso was settled by lot, and the lot fell upon Redding, who, being a\ngentle and meek man, was perhaps best suited for it.\n\nWe may not go into the details of this celebrated trial, which lasted\nthe greater part of the day, and was watched with intense eagerness by\nthe entire population, including some of the older children, who had\nbecome impressed with the delightfully-horrible idea that a hanging or\nshooting, if not flaying and roasting, of some of the criminals would be\nthe certain result.  Suffice it to say that there was grievous\nirregularity in the proceedings: the public prosecutor not only proved\nthe guilt of the men, but in the fervour of his indignation suggested\nthe nature of their punishment; the jury not only listened to the facts\nof the case, but commented on them freely throughout, and, usurping the\njudge's office, pronounced sentence on the criminals three or four times\nover; while the judge himself had the greatest possible difficulty in\nkeeping anything like order all round.\n\nThe only man who performed his duty calmly was Redding, who, in a speech\nthat quite surprised and transfixed the hearers, sought to point out\nthat the men on trial had not actually committed the crime, with which\nthey had been charged, that of seizing the ship, but had only\ncontemplated it, as had been alleged, though even that had not been\nclearly proved; that, supposing the crime to have been committed, it was\na first offence, and that justice should always be tempered with mercy,\nas was taught in that best of all law-books, the Bible.\n\nThe pleading of this man had considerable effect, but it could not turn\nthe tide of feeling in favour of the principal prisoners for more than\none reason.  They had been domineering, turbulent fellows all along;\nthey had meditated a crime which would have robbed the settlers of many\nof the necessaries and all the luxuries of life, and this displayed a\nmeanness of spirit which, they thought, deserved severe punishment.\n\nAccordingly, after they had been pronounced guilty by the unanimous\nvoice of the jury, and after the judge had consulted earnestly with some\nmembers of the privy council, Malines and Morris were condemned to a\nfortnight's imprisonment on short allowance of the poorest food, and the\nother criminals to the same for a week.\n\nWhen Malines had been seized and bound on board the ship, he had\nsubmitted, partly from prudence, and partly from a belief that the whole\naffair was a sort of half joke but when he found himself rebound, after\nthe trial, and cast with his companions into a solid wooden building\nwith a strong door and no window, which had been erected as a sort of\nfortress in which to put the women and children in case of attack by the\nsavages, and there provided with maize and water for food and straw for\nbed, he began to realise the fact that he had indeed fallen into the\nhands of resolute men and under the power of law.\n\n\"I wouldn't mind it so much if they'd only not cut off our baccy,\" he\ngroaned, on the afternoon of the following day, after a prolonged fit of\nsullen silence.\n\n\"After all it sarves us right,\" growled Hugh Morris.\n\n\"Speak for yourself,\" said Jabez Jenkins sulkily.\n\n\"That's just what I do,\" retorted Hugh.\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" from some of the others.\n\nWhat this conversation might have grown to no one can tell, for it was\ninterrupted by the opening of the prison door and the entrance of a\nparty of armed men.\n\n\"I am directed,\" said Otto, who was in command of the party, \"to bring\nyou fellows before the queen, so, come along.\"\n\nHalf amused by and half contemptuous of the leader, who gave his orders\nas if he were a powerful giant, the prisoners rose and marched out.\n\nWhile this scene was taking place in the jail, the widow Lynch was\nholding a private interview with the queen in the palace.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\n\nSHOWS HOW THE QUEEN CONDUCTED HERSELF IN TRYING CIRCUMSTANCES, AND WAS\nFINALLY DETHRONED.\n\n\"Now, darlin',\" said Mrs Lynch to Queen Pauline, as she sat on the side\nof her bed looking contemplatively at the floor, \"thim rascals'll be in\nthe Hall in two minits, so take me advice and give them more nor they've\ngot.\"\n\n\"But my object in sending for them is not to add to their punishment,\"\nsaid the queen.\n\n\"More's the pity, for they need it, an' the Coort was too tinder wi'\nthem intirely.  Two weeks! why, two months would do them more good.\nAnyhow, see that ye give them a fearful blowin' up.\"\n\n\"I'll do what I can for them,\" returned Pina, with a pleasant laugh, as\nshe rose and passed into the Audience Hall, where the prisoners and as\nmany of the settlers as could find room were already gathered.\n\nHere a slight change of feeling seemed to have taken place in the\npeople.  Perhaps the sight of Hugh and Malines--two men who had, up till\nthat time, carried matters with rather a high hand--bound, humbled,\nhelpless, and with bits of straw which had been given them as bedding\nsticking to their garments, induced a touch of pity.  At all events,\nthere was none of that riotous demand for vengeance which had\ncharacterised them when under the influence of excitement at the trial.\nEvidently a slight reaction in favour of the culprits had set in, and\nthe entrance of the queen, therefore, took place in solemn silence, no\none knowing why she had sent for the men or what were her intentions.\nPoor Pauline was much embarrassed by the silence, and by the situation,\nin which she found herself.  Being a girl of mind, and not a mere human\nmachine made and content to run always on beaten paths, she had resolved\nto try an experiment, and braced herself to the duty.\n\nIt was by no means a new experiment; on the contrary, it was older than\nthis world's history, though new to Pauline in the particular\ncircumstances--being an application of the law of mercy.\n\n\"My friends,\" said Pina, in a somewhat tremulous voice, which however\nbecame firmer as she proceeded, \"this is the first trial that has taken\nplace in our little colony, and as crime must be firmly repressed--\"\n\n(\"Punished, my dear--putt it stronger!\" came in a whisper from the side\ndoor, where widow Lynch was listening; but, fortunately, none of the\naudience heard her.)\n\n\"I feel,\" continued Pauline, taking no notice of the advice, \"that it\nbecomes me, as your chosen queen, to do what I think will be best for\nthe interests of the community.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" exclaimed some of the audience; but they gave no further\nexpression to their feelings, being still uncertain as to the queen's\nleanings.\n\n\"No doubt,\" continued Pina, trying, not quite successfully, to swallow\nthe lump in her throat, \"the punishment which you have awarded these men\nis in strict accordance with your ideas of justice, and, being utterly\nignorant of law, I will not presume to doubt the wisdom of your\ndecision; nor would I interfere, either by increasing or decreasing the\npunishment, did I not feel that this case is peculiar, very peculiar.\nIt is, as I have said, the beginning of crime in our kingdom, and little\nbeginnings, you all know, often lead to great results.  A small leak may\nsink a ship.  Then, in the second place, this is the first offence\ncommitted by these men, and first offences require peculiar treatment--\"\n\n(\"That's so, my dear--_powerful_ treatment.  Give it 'em hot!\" inaudibly\nwhispered the widow.)\n\n\"Turning to that Book,\" continued Pauline, \"which shall be my guide in\nevery act of life, I find that God `delighteth in mercy.'  Can I go\nwrong in following humbly in His footsteps?  I think not.  Therefore, I\nventure to exercise the privilege of my position, and extend mercy to\nthese men.  The law has been vindicated by their trial and condemnation.\nI now, in accordance with constitutional right, bestow on them a free\npardon.\"\n\nThis, being rapidly uttered, quite took the people by surprise, and\ncaused them to burst into a ringing cheer, above which the no longer\ninaudible voice of the widow was heard to exclaim--\n\n\"Free parding, indeed!\" in tones of indignant contempt, as she shut the\ndoor with a bang and retired in disgust from the scene.\n\n\"I do not know,\" said the queen, when silence was restored, \"on what\nparticular officer of my household,\" (a confused little smile and blush\nhere), \"falls the duty of setting crim--I mean _forgiven_ men free, so I\nnow order the prime minister to cut their bonds.\"\n\nAmid some laughter, Joe readily drew forth an enormous clasp-knife and\nobeyed this command.  Then the queen, stepping forward, held out her\nhand with a bright smile to Hugh Morris.  None but an utterly abandoned\nwretch could have resisted that.  Hugh gave in at once--seized the hand,\nand not only shook it, but kissed it heartily.  So did Malines, and so\ndid the others, and then they all dispersed--Teddy Malone signalling his\nexit with a cheer and a shout to the following effect--\n\n\"Hooroo! boys--she's ivvery inch a quane, an' two or three eighths\nover--cut an' dry, ready-made, hot off the irons!  We're in luck--eh!\nboys, aren't we?\"\n\nThe latter remark was made, with a hearty slap on the back, to little\nBuxley, who, turning at once and grasping Malone in his arms, went in\nfor a vigorous wrestle by way of relieving his feelings.\n\nWhatever may be thought of this matter by men deep in the learning of\nhuman law, we feel bound to put on record that this plan of Queen\nPauline the First proved a great success, for, from that day forward,\nMalines and Morris and all the other conspirators became excellent\nmembers of the community--gave up all ideas of piracy on the high seas,\nset to work like men to fence in their properties, cultivate their\nfarms, prosecute their fisheries, and otherwise to make themselves\nuseful.  Another result was that Silver Bay Settlement began to\nflourish.\n\nSimilar results usually happen when men give up quarrelling and take to\nworking.  The schoolroom was soon finished.  The queen had her Bible\nclasses--plenty of Bibles having been found in the ship--and Dominick\neven went the length of venturing to conduct special services on\nSundays.\n\nBut, strange to say, the more things prospered on the island, the more\npensive became the queen, as well as Otto and his brother.  It was not\nso with Dr Marsh, however.  Some unknown influence seemed to keep him\nalways in a hearty frame of mind.\n\n\"I can't help it, Dom,\" said the queen, as she walked on the white shore\nof Silver Bay one evening while the sun was descending in a golden\nblaze, \"I can't bear to think of them.\"\n\nPoor Pauline's mind was running on a cheery bald little old gentleman in\nJava, and a mild little spectacled old lady, with knitting proclivities,\nin England, whose chief solace, in a humble way, was an elderly female\ncat.\n\n\"Am I _never_ to see them again?\" she added, as she sat down on a coral\nrock, buried her fair face in her hands, and wept.\n\nDominick tried to comfort her, but in vain.\n\n\"It's all very well what you say, Dom, but here we are settling down as\nif we meant to stay for ever.  Even Otto talks less than he used to\nabout Robinson Crusoe, and no ships ever come near us, and the sailors\ndon't want to quit the islands, so we can't even use the ship we have\ngot, and--and--O darling mother! and dear, _dear_ papa!\"\n\nIf Queen Pina, who broke down at this point, had only known that, about\nthe time she was speaking, the _dear_ papa was running for his life,\ncovered with mud from head to foot, in the midst of thunder and fire and\nsmoke, she might have mingled horror with loving emphasis as she\nmentioned his name.\n\nAt the time of which we write, the island of Java, in the Malay\nArchipelago, was convulsed by one of those tremendous earthquakes which\nhave at irregular intervals, from time immemorial, shattered its\nmountains, overwhelmed some of its fairest lands, and killed thousands\nof its inhabitants.  It is not our intention, however, to touch on this\nsubject more than will suffice to elucidate our tale.\n\nDeeply interesting is it, at times, to note the intimate connection that\nsometimes exists between places and events which seem exceedingly\nremote.  One would imagine that the eruption of a volcanic mountain in\nJava could not have much influence on the life or fortunes of people\nliving on an island nearly a thousand miles distant from the same.  Yet\nso it was, in a double sense, too, as we shall see.\n\nThe great shock in Java, which overturned the bald little old\ngentleman's chair, causing him to spring up and exclaim to his partner,\n\"Hallo, Brooks!\" passed through the intervening earth, losing much of\nits power on the way, caused Refuge Islands to tremble, and Pauline to\nlook up suddenly with the exclamation--\n\n\"What's that Dom?\"\n\n\"It is marvellously like an earthquake, Pina.\"\n\nStrange to say, Brooks in Java made precisely the same remark, at about\nthe same moment, to his senior partner.\n\nThereafter old Mr Rigonda, who didn't like earthquakes, said to\nBrooks--who didn't mind earthquakes, being used to them--\n\n\"I'll start off for England immediately.\"\n\nHe did start off, even more immediately than he had intended, for the\nneighbouring volcano, as if angered by his remark, sent up a shock that\nshook the surrounding houses to their foundations.  The senior partner\nrushed out in terror, and was just in time to receive a shower of mud\nand ashes while he fled away through fire and smoke, as already\nmentioned.\n\nThe volcano went to sleep again for a short time after that little\nindication of its power, and you may be sure that old Rigonda did not\nwait for its reawakening.  One of his own ships was on the point of\nsailing that very day.  He went on board--after cleaning himself--got\nBrooks to wind up their business relations in the cabin, and left for\nEngland with a fair wind.\n\nAnd well was it for the bald little old gentleman that he did so, for, a\nfew days later, strange sounds and appearances were in the air and on\nthe sea.  Fine ashes filled the sky, so that noon became like midnight,\nand everything betokened that something unusually violent must have\noccurred in the land which they had left.  Nothing more serious,\nhowever, befell our voyager.  In due course he reached England, hastened\nhome, and, without warning, burst in upon his wife while that dear\nlittle old lady was in the act of remarking to the middle-aged cat, in a\nvery dolorous tone, that she feared something must have happened to the\nship, for her darlings could never have been so long of writing if all\nhad gone well.\n\nIt was while the cat gazed contemplatively at the everlasting socks, as\nif meditating a reply, that old Rigonda burst in.\n\nStarting up with amazing activity and a cry of joy, the old lady swept\nher feline friend from the table--inadvertently, of course--and rushed\ninto her husband's arms, while the outraged animal sought refuge on top\nof the bookcase, whence it glared at the happy meeting with feelings\nthat may be more easily understood than described.  Of course the old\nman's joy was turned into grief and anxiety when he heard of the\ndeparture of his children and was told of their prolonged silence; but\nwith that we have nothing to do at present.\n\nWe return to Silver Bay, where a sense of insecurity had been aroused in\nthe community, ever since the tremors of the earth, to which we have\njust referred.\n\nWith the slumbering of the Javanese mountains, however, these tremors\nand the consequent fears subsided, and were almost forgotten in another\nsource of anxiety.\n\nOne morning, while Teddy Malone was walking on the beach of Silver Bay,\nhe observed a small object running and stumbling towards him, as if in\ngreat haste or fear.  Hurrying forward to meet this object he soon\nperceived that it was little Brown-eyes, of whom he was very fond.\n\n\"What's wrong, me darlint?\" he asked, catching the child up and kissing\nher.\n\n\"Oh, such funny tings me sawd--oder side de rocks,\" replied Brown-eyes,\npanting; \"come wid me an' see dem.  Come kik!\"\n\n\"Funny things, eh, mavourneen, what sort of things?\"\n\n\"Oh, like beasts.  Come kik!\"\n\n\"They wasn't sarpints, was they?\" said Malone, seating the child on his\nshoulder and hastening towards the rocky point which separated Silver\nBay from the land beyond.\n\n\"No, no--not saa'pints.  Long beasts, like mans, only hims not stand and\nwalk, but lie down and crawl.\"\n\nMuch impressed with the child's eager manner, the Irishman hurried\ntowards the point of rocks, filled with curiosity as to what the\ncreatures could be.\n\n\"What sort o' hids have they, darlint?\" he asked, as he neared the\npoint.\n\n\"Hids same as mans, and faces like you, but more uglier, all scratched\nover, an' dey try to catch me, but me runned away.\"\n\nTeddy Malone's hitherto obtuse faculties were awakened.  He stopped\nsuddenly, being by that time convinced that he stood unarmed within\nspear-throw of savages in ambush.  To advance, supposing his conjecture\nto be right, he knew would be certain death.  To turn and fly would\nprobably be the same, for naked savages could easily overtake him even\nif unburdened with Brown-eyes, whom, of course, he could not forsake,\nand he was too far from the settlement to shout an alarm.\n\nPerspiration burst from poor Teddy's brow, for even delay, he knew,\nwould be fatal, as the savages would suspect him of having discovered\nthem.\n\nSuddenly he put Brown-eyes down on the sand, and, twisting his figure\ninto a comical position, began to hop like a frog.  His device had the\ndesired effect; Brown-eyes burst into a hearty fit of laughter, forgot\nfor the moment the \"funny beasts,\" and cried, \"Do it agin!\"\n\nThe poor man did it again, thinking intensely all the time what he\nshould do next.\n\n\"Would you like to see me dance, darlint?\" he asked suddenly.\n\n\"Oh yis!\"\n\nThereupon Teddy Malone began to dance an Irish jig to his own whistling,\nalthough, being much agitated, he found it no easy matter to whistle in\ntune or time, but that was unimportant.  As he danced he took care to\nback in a homeward direction.  The child naturally followed.  Thus, by\nslow degrees, he got beyond what he considered spear-throw, and feeling\nboldness return with security, he caught the child up and danced with\nher on his shoulder.  Then he set her down, and pretended to chase her.\nHe even went the length of chasing her a little way in the wrong\ndirection, in order to throw the savages more completely off their\nguard.  By degrees he got near to the settlement, and there was met by\nOtto.\n\n\"You seem jolly to-day, Ted,\" said the boy.\n\n\"Whist, lad,\" returned the other, without intermitting his exercise.\n\"Look as if ye was admirin' me.  There's lot of them tattooed monkeys--\nsavages--beyant the pint.  They don't know I've found it out.  Slink up\nan' gather the boys, an' look alive.  I'll amuse 'em here till you come\nback.  An' I say, don't forgit to bring me revolver an' cutlash.\"\n\n\"All right,\" was Otto's brief reply, as he sauntered slowly up towards\nthe bushes.  No sooner was he screened by these, however, than he ran\nlike a hare to the palace.\n\n\"Halloo!  Dom, Joe, Hugh--all of you--the savages again!  Arm--quick!\"\n\nIt needed no urging to hasten the movements of all who heard the boy's\nvoice.  Ever since the first appearance of the savages Dominick and the\ndoctor had put all the men of the settlement under daily training in\ndrill for an hour or so, that they might be better able to act promptly\nand in concert if occasion should again occur.  The arms had been\ncollected, and such of them as were not in use stored in a handy\nposition, so that in two minutes an armed company was proceeding at a\nrun towards the spot on the shore where Malone was still performing his\nantics, to the inexpressible delight of Brown-eyes.\n\n\"Where are the spalpeens?\" asked the widow Lynch, who had followed the\nmen.\n\n\"Beyant the rocks, mother,\" answered Malone, as he received his weapons\nfrom Otto and fell into his place in the ranks; \"ye'd as well take the\nchild home, or she'll be sure to follow--she's nigh as wild as yerself.\"\n\nThe widow was indeed fond of seeing, as she used to say, \"all the fun\nthat was goin',\" but on this occasion she consented to carry Brown-eyes\nout of danger while the settlers moved at a quick step towards the\npoint.\n\nBehind that point of rocks a band of savages lay concealed, as Malone\nhad rightly conjectured.  There were about forty of them, all armed with\nclubs and spears, evidently bent on attacking the settlement.  Of course\nthey meant to do it by surprise, and had concealed themselves among the\nbushes behind the point, where they probably would have lain till\nnightfall if Brown-eyes in her wanderings had not discovered them.\nTheir chief would have instantly caught and silenced the poor child, had\nshe not run so far clear of the point that he would infallibly have\nrevealed himself to Teddy Malone in doing so.\n\nWhen that worthy drew near to the rocks, as described, the chief got\nready a spear for his reception.  When Malone took to dancing, the chief\ncondescended to smile, or grin, hideously.  When he retreated out of\nrange the chief consoled himself with the reflection that it was just as\nwell, night being the best time for attack.  When, however, he beheld a\nband of men moving towards him armed with the terrible things that\n\"spouted smoke, fire, and stones,\" a change came over the spirit of his\ndream.  After a hasty consultation with his comrades, he glided off in\nthe direction of their canoe.  The rest followed, and when our settlers\nat last turned the point, they saw the foe paddling at full speed across\nthe lagoon.\n\nFiring a volley of disappointment after them, both in words and bullets,\nthey ran to their boats and gave chase, but, as on the former occasion,\nthe canoe proved too swift for the boats under oars, and the savages got\naway.\n\nThe anxiety that naturally filled the breasts of Queen Pauline and her\ncouncillors at this event was speedily forgotten in a recurrence of the\nearthquake which had previously alarmed them so much.\n\nIt happened on a calm, bright morning, when the widow Lynch chanced to\nbe washing garments in the palace beside the queen.  You see they had\nnot much regard for state-ceremonial or etiquette at the court of\nPauline the First even in public, much less in private, so that, while\nthe widow was deep in the washtub at one end of the hall, the queen was\nbusy at the other end patching Otto's garments.\n\nAt first there occurred a slight trembling of the earth, which the\nwidow, attributing to giddiness in her own cranium, recognised with a\nremonstrative \"Ohone!\"\n\n\"Did you feel _that_?\" exclaimed Pauline, pausing in her work and\nlooking up with a slight feeling of alarm.\n\n\"_What_, dearie?\" demanded the widow, clearing the soap-suds from her\nred roly-poly arms.\n\nBefore Pauline could answer, the earthquake took the liberty of reply by\ngiving an abrupt shake to the whole island, which not only set chairs\nand tables rocking in an alarming manner, but drove the entire\npopulation from their houses in consternation.  Among other effects it\ncaused Mrs Lynch to stagger and catch hold of the washtub, which, far\nfrom supporting her, let her fall to the ground, and fell on the top of\nher.\n\nTo most of the settlers the sensation of a trembling earth was quite new\nand exceedingly alarming.  They stopped abruptly after the first rush,\nand then looked about with pale faces, not knowing what to do.  Malines,\nhowever, was cool and collected.  He had been in various volcanic\nregions of the world, and undertook to comfort them.\n\n\"Don't be afraid,\" he said, when the most of the people had gathered\nround him.  \"I've often seen this sort o' thing, on the coast o' South\nAmerica and among the Malay Islands.  It passes away after a while, and\noften without doin' much damage--though I _have_ seen a town shook\nalmost to pieces in about five minutes.\"\n\n\"And what did they do?\" asked Jabez Jenkins.\n\n\"Och, whirri-hoo!\" shouted Teddy Malone, for at that moment another\nshock was felt, more violent than the preceding.  The earth seemed\nabsolutely to roll, and one or two of the huts that had been carelessly\nbuilt, fell asunder in partial ruin.\n\n\"Where is my brother--and the doctor?\" demanded Pauline, running up to\nthe group at the moment.\n\n\"They're away up the mountain, with Joe and Otto,\" answered little\nBuxley; \"I saw 'em start soon after daybreak--to explore, they said.\"\n\n\"What do you think should be done?\" asked Pina, turning naturally to the\nmate, as being the most intelligent of those around her.\n\n\"If it's goin' to be bad,\" said Malines, \"I would advise you all to git\non board the ship as fast as ye can, for the land isn't so safe as the\nwater when it takes to quakin'.\"\n\n\"You seem to have had some experience of it.  Is it going to be bad,\nthink you?\"\n\n\"Earthquakes are deceptive--no man can tell.\"\n\n\"Well, then, we must do our best at once,\" said the queen, with an air\nof calm decision worthy of her rank.  \"Go, Mr Malines, with your\nsailors, and get all the boats ready.  And you, my people, carry down\nwhat you esteem most valuable and get on board the ship without loss of\ntime--for the rest, we are in the hands of a loving and merciful God.\"\n\nWhile these events were enacting on the shore, Dominick, Otto, the\ndoctor, and Joe Binney were seated near the summit of the highest peak,\nenjoying a cold breakfast.  It was their first visit to that particular\npeak, which had a slight hollow or basin of perhaps fifty feet diameter\nin the centre.\n\nJust before the first tremulous shock the doctor had been explaining to\nthe prime minister the nature of volcanoes, and stating his opinion that\nthe cup-like hollow before them was an extinct crater.  The slight shock\nstopped him in his discourse, and caused the party to look at each other\nwith serious faces.\n\n\"It's not extinct yet,\" exclaimed Otto excitedly, pointing to the\nhollow, the earth of which had suddenly cracked in several places and\nwas emitting puffs of sulphurous smoke and steam.\n\nThey all started up.\n\n\"We'd better hasten home,\" said Dominick.\n\n\"Yes--they'll be terribly scared,\" said the doctor, hastily beginning to\npack up the remains of their breakfast.\n\nBut, before this could be done, the second convulsion took place.\nViolent trembling occurred for a few seconds; then the ground in the old\ncrater burst open, and, with a terrible explosion, fire and smoke\nbelched forth, sending huge fragments of rock and showers of ashes into\nthe air, which latter fell around the explorers in all directions--\nfortunately without doing them injury.\n\nThey waited no longer.  Without even uttering a word they all turned and\nran down the hill at full speed.  Being a considerable distance from the\nsettlement, it was upwards of an hour before they arrived.  By that time\nmost of the women and children had been sent off to the ship.  Pauline,\nhowever, had remained on shore to direct and encourage the rest, as well\nas to await the return of her brothers.\n\n\"Right--right--you couldn't have done better,\" said Dominick, when\nPauline hastily explained how she had acted.\n\n\"It was Mr Malines, not I, who suggested the plan,\" returned the queen.\n\n\"Hadn't you better go on board yourself?\" said the doctor, \"and leave us\nto manage.\"\n\n\"No, I am not a mere puppet, sir,\" answered Pauline, with a little\nsmile, yet firmly.  \"My place is here till all my subjects are safe!\nAnd your duty is to assist in the embarkation, not to offer advice to\nyour queen!\"\n\nWith a laugh the doctor went off to do his duty, muttering, \"My _queen_,\nindeed!\" fervently.\n\nFor some time the volcano, which had thus sprung into sudden activity,\npartially subsided, yet there were occasional tremulous motions of the\nearth and low growlings in the heart of the mountain on Big Island,\nwhile several minor explosions occurred in the crater, so that the\nthoroughly alarmed settlers hastened the embarkation with all despatch.\nBefore night had closed in they were all safely on board with most of\ntheir lighter valuables and tools, though, necessarily, much of their\nheavier property was left behind.  Where life is threatened, however,\nmen are not apt to mind such losses.\n\nIt now became a question whether they should remain at anchor where they\nwere and abide the issue, or proceed at once to sea.  Some were for\nremaining, others were for putting off to sea.  There was much wrangling\nover it at first, and the people seemed in their anxiety to have quite\nforgotten their queen, when she stepped forward, and, raising her clear\nsilvery voice, produced a dead calm at once.\n\n\"Joe,\" she said, \"go down to the cabin and await me there.\"\n\nThe prime minister obeyed instantly.\n\n\"Now,\" said Pauline, turning to the people, \"choose among you six of\nyour number to consult with me, and do it at once.\"\n\nOf course, the men well-known as the best among the settlers were\ninstantly named we need scarcely add that among them were Dominick, the\ndoctor, and Malines.\n\nWhile these were engaged in consultation below, a terrible outburst of\nthe volcano settled the matter for them, and brought them all hastily on\ndeck.\n\nThe summit of the crater seemed to have been blown up into the air with\na most terrific noise, while a dense mass of smoke, steam, and ashes was\nhurled upwards, and seemed to blot out the sky.  Twilight, which had\nbeen deepening, was converted into blackest night in a moment, and\ndarkness profound would undoubtedly have continued, had it not been for\nthe lurid glare of the fires which flashed at intervals from the crater.\nSuddenly the waters of the sea became agitated.  The ship rocked\nuneasily, and jerked at her cable, while the terrified people clung to\nshrouds and ropes, and belaying-pins.  Then the fire on the mountain-top\nincreased tenfold in volume and intensity.  Another moment, and several\nlarge holes opened in the mountain-side nearest to them, from which\nstreams of molten lava burst forth and began to descend towards the\ndeserted settlement.\n\nAt that moment there was a great shout.  It had been discovered that in\nthe confusion little Brown-eyes had been forgotten!\n\nA small boat hung at the davits on the port side.  It was manned\ninstantly.  The doctor jumped to the helm, Otto followed, and, before\nany could interpose, the queen suddenly stepped in.\n\n\"You are mad!\" cried the doctor.\n\n\"Lower away!\" said Pina, as if she had been a trained sea-captain all\nher life.\n\nInstantly the ropes were eased off, and in a few seconds the boat was in\nthe sea and on the shore.  They found little Brown-eyes sound asleep in\nher crib, with a river of red-hot lava stretching its fiery tongues\ntowards her as if eager for a meal!\n\nSupple-limbed Otto was first; he seized the child and bore her off to\nthe boat.  Another terrible explosion occurred just then.  Ashes and\nmasses of rock began to rain around them.  A falling stone struck\nPauline's head, and she fell.  The doctor, who held her hand, seized her\nin his arms and bore her away.  A few minutes more and they were all\nsafe on board again.\n\nBut there was no time for congratulations.  The sea which had before\nbeen agitated, now heaved in wild waves, though there was no wind.  It\nwas then seen that Big Island was actually crumbling--sinking into the\nwater!  The continuous rumbling of the volcano was terrible.\nIntermittent explosions were frequent.  To add to the horrors of the\nscene the darkness deepened.  As the island went down the sea rushed\ntumultuously in to overwhelm it.  Then it was that the stout cable,\nunder God, saved them from immediate destruction.  The ship was hurled\nfrom side to side like a cork on the boiling flood.  But no cable could\nlong withstand such a strain.  The chain snapped at last, and they\nseemed to be rushing with railway speed to their fate amid surrounding\nfire and overwhelming water, and roaring thunders, and raining ashes,\nwhen, suddenly, there was a perceptible diminution in the turmoil, and,\ngradually, the waves calmed down.  With feelings of intense thankfulness\nthe terrified people let go their second anchor, though the darkness was\nby that time so thick that they could barely see each other.\n\nIt may be imagined what a night of anxiety they spent.  With Pauline and\nsome others it was a night of earnest prayer.\n\nWhen the light of day at last broke faintly in the east it revealed the\nfact that Refuge Islands had actually and totally disappeared, and that\nour settlers were floating on the bosom of the open sea!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\n\nLAST CHAPTER.\n\nAn Island Queen no longer, Pauline Rigonda sits on the quarter-deck of\nthe emigrant ship gazing pensively over the side at the sunlit sea.\nDethroned by the irresistible influences of fire and water, our heroine\nhas retired into the seclusion of private life.\n\nAfter escaping from the volcano, as described in the last chapter, the\nsettlers resolved to proceed, under the guidance of Malines as captain,\nand Morris as mate, to the port for which they had originally been bound\nwhen the disaster on Refuge Islands had arrested them.\n\nOf course this was a great disappointment to poor Pauline and her\nbrothers, who, as may be imagined, were burning with anxiety to get back\nto England.  Feeling, however, that it would be unreasonable as well as\nselfish to expect the emigrants to give up their long-delayed plans\nmerely to meet their wishes, they made up their minds to accept the\nsituation with a good grace.\n\n\"You see,\" said Otto to the ex-queen--for he was becoming very wise in\nhis own eyes, and somewhat oracular in the midst of all these\nexcitements--\"when a fellow can't help himself he's bound to make the\nbest of a bad business.\"\n\n\"Don't you think it would be better to say he is bound to accept\ntrustingly what God arranges, believing that it will be all for the\nbest?\" returned Pauline.\n\n\"How can a bad business be for the best?\" demanded Otto, with the air of\none who has put an unanswerable question.\n\nHis sister looked at him with an expression of perplexity.  \"Well, it is\nnot easy to explain,\" she said, \"yet I can believe that all _is_ for the\nbest.\"\n\n\"Ha, Pina!\" returned the boy, with a little touch of pride, \"it's all\nvery well for you to say that, but you won't get men to believe things\nin that way.\"\n\n\"Otto,\" said Dr Marsh, who was standing near and listening to the\nconversation, \"it is not so difficult as you think to prove that what we\ncall a bad business may after all be for the best.  I remember at this\nmoment a case in point.  Come--I'll tell you a story.  Once upon a time\nI knew a gentleman with a stern face and a greedy soul, who believed in\nnothing, almost, except in the wickedness of mankind, and in his own\ncapacity to take advantage of that wickedness in order to make money.\nMoney was his god.  He spent all his time and all his strength in making\nit, and he was successful.  He had many ships on the sea, and much gold\nin the bank.  He had also a charming little wife, who prayed in secret\nthat God would deliver her husband from his false god, and he had a dear\nlittle daughter who loved him to distraction in spite of his `business\nhabits!'  Well, one year there came a commercial crisis.  Mr Getall\neagerly risked his money and over-speculated.  That same year was\ndisastrous in the way of storms and wrecks.  Among the wrecks were\nseveral of Mr Getall's finest ships.  A fire reduced one of his\nwarehouses to ashes, and, worse still, one of his most confidential and\ntrusted clerks absconded with some thousands of pounds.  All that was a\nvery bad business, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"It was,\" assented Otto; \"go on.\"\n\n\"The upshot was a crash--\"\n\n\"What!--of the burning warehouse?\"\n\n\"No; of the whole business, and the Getalls were reduced to comparative\nbeggary.  The shock threw the poor little wife, who had always been\nrather delicate, into bad health, rendering a warm climate necessary for\nher at a time when they could not afford to travel.  Moreover, little\nEva's education was entirely stopped at perhaps the most important\nperiod of her life.  That was a bad business, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"That was a much worse business,\" asserted Otto.\n\n\"Well, when Mr Getall was at the lowest stage of despair, and had taken\nmore than one look over the parapet of London Bridge with a view to\nsuicide, he received a letter from a long-neglected brother, who had for\nmany years dwelt on the Continent, partly for economy and partly for a\nson's health.  The brother offered him a home in the south of France for\nthe winter, as it would do his wife good, he said, and he had room in\nhis house for them all, and wanted their company very much to keep him\nfrom being dull in that land of warmth and sunshine!  Getall was not the\nman to refuse such an offer.  He went.  The brother was an earnest\nChristian.  His influence at that critical time of sore distress was the\nmeans in the Holy Spirit's hands of rescuing the miser's soul, and\ntransferring his heart from gold to the Saviour.  A joy which he had\nnever before dreamed of took possession of him, and he began, timidly at\nfirst to commend Jesus to others.  Joy, they say, is curative.  The\neffect of her husband's conversion did so much good to little Mrs\nGetall's spirit that her body began steadily to mend, and in time she\nwas restored to better health than she had enjoyed in England.  The\nbrother-in-law, who was a retired schoolmaster, undertook the education\nof Eva, and, being a clever man as well as good, trained her probably\nmuch better than she would have been trained had she remained at home.\nAt last they returned to England, and Mr Getall, with the assistance of\nfriends, started afresh in business.  He never again became a rich man\nin the worldly sense, but he became rich enough to pay off all his\ncreditors to the last farthing; rich enough to have something to spare\nfor a friend in distress; rich enough to lay past something for Eva's\ndower, and rich enough to contribute liberally to the funds of those\nwhose business it is to `consider the poor.'  All that, you see, being\nthe result of what you have admitted, my boy, was a bad business.\"\n\n\"True, but then,\" objected Otto, who was of an argumentative turn, \"if\nall that _hadn't_ resulted, it would have been a bad business still.\"\n\n\"Not necessarily--it might have turned out to be a good business in some\nother way, or for somebody else.  The mere fact that we can't see how,\nis no argument against the theory that _everything_ is constrained to\nwork for good by Him who rules the universe.\"\n\n\"What! even sin?\" asked Otto, in surprise.\n\n\"Even sin,\" returned the doctor.  \"Don't you see that it was Getall's\nsin of greed and over-speculation, and the clerk's sin of embezzlement,\nwhich led to all these good results; but, of course, as neither of them\nhad any desire or intention to achieve the good results which God\nbrought about, they were none the less guilty, and were entitled to no\ncredit, but, on the contrary, to condign punishment.  What I wish to\nprove is that God causes _all things_ to work out His will, yet leaves\nthe free-will of man untouched.  This is a great mystery; at the same\ntime it is a great fact, and therefore I contend that we have every\nreason to trust our loving Father, knowing that whatever happens to us\nwill be for the best--not, perhaps, for our present pleasure or\ngratification, but for our ultimate best.\"\n\n\"But--but--but,\" said Otto, while premature wrinkles rippled for a\nminute over his smooth brow, \"at that rate, is it fair to blame sinners\nwhen their very sins are made to bring about God's will?\"\n\n\"Now, Otto, don't run away with a false idea.  For you to sin with a\nview to bring about good, is one thing--and a very wicked thing, which\nis severely condemned in Scripture--but for God to cause good to result\nfrom your sin, and in spite of _you_, is a totally different thing.\nThink of a pirate, my boy, a bloody-handed villain, who has spent his\nlife of crime in gathering together enormous wealth, with which to\nretire into selfish enjoyment at last.  But he is captured.  His wealth\nis taken from him, and with it good men establish almshouses for the\naged poor, hospitals for the sick, free libraries and free baths\neverywhere, and many other good and beneficent works.  The pirate's\nlabours have, in God's providence, been turned into this channel.  Is\nthe pirate less guilty, or less deserving of punishment on that\naccount?\"\n\nFurther discussion on this point was interrupted by a sharp order from\nMalines to reduce sail, and the consequent bustling about of the\nsailors.\n\n\"Going to blow, think you?\" asked Dominick, who came on deck at the\nmoment.\n\n\"Can't tell yet,\" replied the mate, \"but the glass has fallen suddenly,\nand one must be prepared, all the more that the ship has been more\nseverely strained on the reef than I had thought.  Would Miss Pauline be\nprepared,\" he added in a lower tone, \"to receive the deputation this\nafternoon?\"\n\n\"Yes, she is quite prepared,\" returned Dominick, in the same low tone,\n\"though she is much perplexed, not being able to understand what can be\nwanted of her.  Is it so profound a secret that I may not know it?\"\n\n\"You shall both know it in good time,\" the mate replied, as he turned to\ngive fresh directions to the man at the wheel.\n\nThat afternoon the assembly in the cabin could hardly be styled a\ndeputation, for it consisted of as many of the emigrants as could\nsqueeze in.  It was led by Joe Binney, who stood to the front with a\ndocument in his hand.  Pauline, with some trepidation and much surprise\nexpressed on her pretty face, was seated on the captain's chair, with an\nextra cushion placed thereon to give it a more throne-like dignity.  She\nwas supported by Dominick on one side and Otto on the other.\n\nJoe advanced a few paces, stooping his tall form, partly in reverence\nand partly to avoid the deck-beams.  Clearing his throat, and with a\nslightly awkward air, he read from the document as follows:--\n\n\"Dear Miss Pauline, may it please yer majesty, for we all regards you\nyet as our lawful queen, I've bin appinted, as prime minister of our\ncommunity--which ain't yet broke up--to express our wishes, likewise our\nsentiments.\"\n\n\"That's so--go it, Joe,\" broke in a soft whisper from Teddy Malone.\n\n\"We wishes, first of all,\" continued the premier, \"to say as how we're\nvery sorry that your majesty's kingdom has bin blowed up an' sunk to the\nbottom o' the sea,\" (\"Worse luck!\" from Mrs Lynch),--\"but we\ncongratulate you an' ourselves that we, the people, are all\nalive,\"--(\"an' kickin',\" softly, from Malone--\"Hush!\" \"silence!\" from\nseveral others),--\"an' as loyal an' devoted as ever we was.\"  (\"More\nso,\" and \"Hear, hear!\").  \"Since the time you, Queen Pauline, took up\nthe reins of guvermint, it has bin plain to us all that you has done\nyour best to rule in the fear o' God, in justice, truthfulness, an'\nlovin' kindness.  An' we want to tell you, in partikler, that your\nreadin's out of the Bible to us an' the child'n--which was no part o'\nyour royal dooty, so to speak--has done us all a power o' good, an'\nthere was some of us big uns as needed a lot o' good to be done us, as\nwell as the child'n--\" (\"Sure an' that's true, annyhow!\" from Teddy).\n\n\"Now, what we've got to say,\" continued Joe, clearing his throat again,\nand taking a long breath, \"is this--the land we're agoin' to ain't\nthickly popilated, as we knows on, an' we would take it kindly if you'd\nconsent to stop there with us, an' continue to be our queen, so as we\nmay all stick together an' be rightly ruled on the lines o' lovin'\nkindness,\"--(\"With a taste o' the broomstick now an' then,\" from Teddy).\n\"If your majesty agrees to this, we promise you loyal submission an'\nsarvice.  Moreover, we will be glad that your brother, Mister Dominick,\nshould be prime minister, an' Mister Otto his scritairy, or wotever else\nyou please.  Also that Dr Marsh should be the chansler o' the checkers,\nor anything else you like, as well as sawbones-in-gineral to the\ncommunity.  An' this our petition,\" concluded Joe, humbly laying the\ndocument at Pauline's feet, \"has bin signed by every man in the ship--\nexcept Teddy Malone--\"\n\n\"That's a lie!\" shouted the amazed Teddy.\n\n\"Who,\" continued Joe, regardless of the interruption, \"not bein' able to\nwrite, has put his cross to it.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" cried the relieved Irishman, while the rest laughed\nloudly--but not long, for it was observed that Pauline had put her\nhandkerchief to her eyes.\n\nWhat the ex-queen said in reply, we need not put down in detail.  Of\ncourse, she expressed her gratitude for kind expressions, and her\nthankfulness for what had been said about her Sabbath-school work.  She\nalso explained that her dear mother in England, as well as their old\nfather in Java, must be filled with deepest anxiety on account of\nherself and her brothers by that time, and that, therefore, she was\nobliged, most unwillingly, to decline the honour proposed to her.\n\n\"Och!\" exclaimed the disappointed widow Lynch, \"cudn't ye sind for yer\nmother to come out to yez, an' the ould man in Javy too?  They'd be\nheartily welcome, an' sure we'd find 'em some sitivation under guvermint\nto kape their pot bilin'.\"\n\nBut these strong inducements failed to change the ex-queen's mind.\n\nNow, while this was going on in the cabin, a change was taking place in\nthe sky.  The bad weather which Malines had predicted came down both\nsuddenly and severely, and did the ship so much damage as to render\nrefitting absolutely necessary.  There was no regular port within\nhundreds of miles of them, but Malines said he knew of one of the\neastern isles where there was a safe harbour, good anchorage, and plenty\nof timber.  It would not take long to get there, though, considering the\ndamaged state of the ship, it might take some months before they could\nget her into a fit state to continue the voyage.  Accordingly, they\naltered their course, with heavy hearts, for the emigrants were\ndisappointed at having their voyage again interrupted, while the\nRigondas were depressed at the thought of the prolonged anxiety of their\nparents.\n\n\"Now this _is_ a bad business, isn't it?\" said Otto to the doctor, with\na groan, when the course was decided.\n\n\"Looks like it, my boy; but it isn't,\" replied the doctor, who\nnevertheless, being himself but a frail mortal, was so depressed that he\ndid not feel inclined to say more.\n\nIn this gloomy state of matters Pina's sweet tones broke upon them like\na voice from the better land--as in truth it was--saying, \"I will trust\nand not be afraid.\"\n\nAbout this time the cloud which hung over the emigrant ship was darkened\nstill more by a visit from the Angel of Death.  The mother of Brown-eyes\ndied.  At that time Pauline was indeed an angel of mercy to mother and\nchild.  After the remains of the mother were committed to the deep, the\npoor orphan clung so piteously to Pauline that it was scarcely possible\nto tear her away.  It was agreed at last that, as the child had now no\nnatural protector, except an uncle and aunt, who seemed to think they\nhad already too many children of their own, Pauline should adopt her.\n\nWhen the emigrants reached the island-harbour, without further mishap,\nthey were surprised to find a large steamer at anchor.  The captain of\nit soon explained that extensive damage to the machinery had compelled\nhim to run in there for shelter while the necessary repairs were being\neffected.\n\n\"Where are you bound for?\" asked Dominick, who with Dr Marsh and Otto\nhad accompanied Malines on board the steamer.\n\n\"For England.\"\n\n\"For England?\" almost shouted Dominick and Otto in the same breath.\n\n\"Yes.  Our repairs are completed, we set off to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Have you room for two or three passengers?\"\n\n\"Yes, plenty of room.  We shall have to put several ashore at the Cape,\nwhere I hope to get a doctor, too, for our doctor died soon after we\nleft port, and we are much in want of one, having a good many sick men\non board.\"\n\n\"Otto,\" whispered Dr Marsh, \"our having been diverted from our course\nhas not turned out such a bad business after all, has it?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, the very best that could have happened.  I'll never\ngive way to unbelief again!\"\n\nPoor Otto!  He did not at that time know how deeply doubt and unbelief\nare ingrained in the human heart.  He did not know that man has to be\nconvinced again and again, and over again, before he learns to hope\nagainst hope, and to believe heartily at all times that, \"He doeth all\nthings well.\"\n\nIt was with very mingled feelings that the Rigondas, Dr Marsh, and\nBrown-eyes parted next day from the friends with whom they had\nassociated so long.  It is no exaggeration to say that there was\nscarcely a dry eye in the two vessels; for, while the settlers wept for\nsorrow, the crews and passengers wept more or less from sympathy.  Even\nthe dead-eyes of the ship, according to Malone, shed tears!  As for poor\nBrown-eyes, who was a prime favourite with many of her old friends, male\nand female, before she got away she had been almost crushed out of\nexistence by strong arms, and her eyes might have been pea-green or pink\nfor anything you could tell, so lost were they in the swollen lids.\nLong after the vessels had separated the settlers continued to shout\nwords of good-will and blessing, \"We'll never forgit ye, Miss Pauline,\"\ncame rolling after them in the strong tones of Joe Binney.  \"God bless\nyou, Miss,\" came not less heartily from Hugh Morris.  \"We loves ye,\ndarlint,\" followed clear and shrill from the vigorous throat of the\nwidow Lynch, and a wild \"Hooray!\" from Teddy endorsed the sentiment.\nNobbs, the blacksmith, and little Buxley, ran up the rigging to make the\nwaving of their caps more conspicuous, and when faces could no longer be\ndistinguished and voices no longer be heard, the waving of kerchiefs\ncontinued until the rounding of a cape suddenly shut them all out from\nview for ever.\n\n\"Thank God,\" said Dr Marsh, with a voice deepened and tremulous from\nemotion, \"that though they have lost their queen, they shall never lose\nthe sweet influences she has left behind her.\"\n\nThe great ocean steamer had now cleared the land; her mighty engines\nseemed to throb with joy at being permitted once more to, \"Go ahead,\nfull speed,\" and soon she was cleaving her way grandly through the\nbroad-backed billows of the Southern sea--homeward bound!\n\nLet us leap on in advance of her.\n\nThe little old lady with the gold spectacles and neat black cap, and\nsmooth, braided hair, is seated in her old arm-chair, with the old sock,\napparently--though it must have been the latest born of many hundreds of\nsocks--on the needles, and the unfailing cat at her elbow.  The aspect\nof the pair gives the impression that if a French Revolution or a Chili\nearthquake were to visit England they would click-and-gaze on with\nimperturbable serenity through it all.\n\nBut the little old lady is not alone now.  Old Mr Rigonda sits at the\ntable opposite to her, with his forehead in his hands, as though he\nsought to squeeze ideas into his head from a book which lies open before\nhim on the table.  Vain hope, for the book is upside down.  Profound\nsilence reigns, with the exception of the clicking needles and the\npurring cat.\n\n\"My dear,\" at length exclaimed the bald old gentleman, looking up with a\nweary sigh.\n\n\"Yes, John?\"  (Such is his romantic Christian name!)\n\n\"I can't stand it, Maggie.\"  (Such is _her_ ditto!)\n\n\"It is, indeed, hard to bear, John.  If we only knew for certain that\nthey are--are gone, it seems as if we could bow to His will; but this\nterrible and wearing uncertainty is awful.  Did you make inquiry at\nLloyd's to-day?\"\n\n\"Lloyd's?  You seem to think Lloyd's can tell everything about all that\nhappens on the sea.  No, it's of no use inquiring anywhere, or doing\nanything.  We can only sit still and groan.\"\n\nIn pursuance of this remaining consolation, the poor old gentleman\ngroaned heavily and squeezed his forehead tighter, and gazed at the\nreversed book more sternly, while the old lady heaved several deep\nsighs.  Even the cat introduced a feeble mew, as of sympathy, into the\nmidst of its purr--the hypocrite!\n\n\"It was the earthquake that did it,\" cried Mr Rigonda, starting up, and\npacing the room wildly, \"I'm convinced of that.\"\n\n\"How can that be, John, dear, when you were in Java at the time, and our\ndarlings were far away upon the sea?\"\n\n\"How can _I_ tell how it could be, Maggie?  Do you take me for a\ngeological philosopher, who can give reasons for every earthly thing he\nasserts?  All I know is that these abominable earthquakes go half\nthrough the world sometimes.  Pity they don't go through the other half,\nsplit the world in two, and get rid of the subterranean fires\naltogether.\"\n\n\"John, my dear!\"\n\n\"Well, Maggie, don't be hard on me for gettin' irascible now and then.\nIf you only knew what I suffer when--but forgive me.  You _do_ know what\nI suffer--there!\"\n\nHe stooped and kissed the old lady's forehead.  The cat, uncertain,\napparently, whether an assault was meant, arched its back and tall, and\nglared slightly.  Seeing however that nothing more was done, it\nsubsided.\n\nJust then the wheels of a cab were heard rattling towards the front\ndoor, as if in haste.  The vehicle stopped suddenly.  Then there was\nimpatient thundering at the knocker, and wild ringing of the bell.\n\n\"Fire!\" gasped the half-petrified Mrs Rigonda.\n\n\"No smell!\" said her half-paralysed spouse.\n\nLoud voices in the passage; stumbling feet on the stairs; suppressed\nfemale shrieks; bass masculine exclamations; room door burst open; old\ncouple, in alarm, on their feet; cat, in horror, on the top of the\nbookcase!\n\n\"Mother! mother!  O father!\"--yelled, rather than spoken.\n\nAnother moment, and the bald, little old man was wrestling in the\nex-queen's arms; the little old lady was engulfed by Dominick and Otto;\nDr John Marsh and Brown-eyes stood transfixed and smiling with idiotic\njoy at the door; while the cat--twice its size, with every hair erect--\nglared, and evolved miniature volcanoes in its stomach.\n\nIt was an impressive sight.  Much too much so to dwell on!\n\nPassing it over, let us look in on that happy home when toned down to a\ncondition of reasonable felicity.\n\n\"It's a dream--all a wild, unbelievable dream!\" sighed the old\ngentleman, as, with flushed face and dishevelled hair, he spread himself\nout in an easy chair, with Queen Pina on his knee and Brown-eyes at his\nfeet.  \"Hush! all of you--wait a bit.\"\n\nThere was dead silence, and some surprise for a few seconds, while Mr\nRigonda shut his eyes tight and remained perfectly still, during which\nbrief lull the volcanic action in the cat ceased, and its fur slowly\ncollapsed.\n\n\"Dreams shift and change so!\" murmured the sceptical man, gradually\nopening his eyes again--\"What! you're there yet, Pina?\"\n\n\"Of course I am, darling daddy.\"\n\n\"Here, pinch me on the arm, Dominick--the tender part, else I'll not\nwaken up sufficiently to dispel it.\"\n\nA fresh outburst of hilarity, which started the stomachic volcanoes and\nhair afresh, while Pauline flung her arms round her father's neck for\nthe fiftieth time, and smothered him.  When he was released, and\npartially recovered, Otto demanded to know if he really wanted the dream\ndispelled.\n\n\"Certainly not, my boy, certainly not, if it's real; but it would be so\ndreadfully dismal to awake and find you all gone, that I'd prefer to\ndream it out, and turn to something else, if possible, before waking.\nI--I--\"\n\nHere the old gentleman suddenly seized his handkerchief, with a view to\nwipe his eyes, but, changing his mind, blew his nose instead.\n\nJust then the door opened, and a small domestic entered with that\neminently sociable meal, tea.  With a final explosion, worthy of Hecla\nor Vesuvius, the cat shot through the doorway, as if from a catapult,\nand found refuge in the darkest recesses of the familiar coal-hole.\n\n\"But who,\" said Mr Rigonda, casting his eyes suddenly downward, \"who is\nthis charming little brown-eyed maid that you have brought with you from\nthe isles of the southern seas?  A native--a little Fiji princess--eh?\"\n\n\"Hush! father,\" whispered Pauline in his ear, \"she's a dear little\norphan who has adopted me as her mother, and would not be persuaded to\nleave me.  So, you see, I've brought her home.\"\n\n\"Quite right, quite right,\" returned the old man, stooping to kiss the\nlittle one.  \"I've often thought you'd be the better of a sister, Pina,\nso, perhaps, a daughter will do as well.\"\n\n\"Now, then, tea is ready; draw in your chairs, darlings,\" said Mrs\nRigonda, with a quavering voice.  The truth is that all the voices\nquavered that night, more or less, and it was a matter of uncertainty\nseveral times whether the quavering would culminate in laughter or in\ntears.\n\n\"Why do you so often call Pina a queen, dear boy?\" asked Mrs Rigonda of\nher volatile son, Otto.\n\n\"Why?\" replied the youth, whose excitement did not by any means injure\nhis appetite--to judge from the manner in which he disposed of muffins\nand toast, sandwiched now and then with wedges of cake--\"Why? because\nshe _is_ a queen--at least she _was_ not long ago.\"\n\nAn incredulous smile playing on the good lady's little mouth, Pauline\nwas obliged to corroborate Otto's statement.\n\n\"And what were you queen of?\" asked her father, who was plainly under\nthe impression that his children were jesting.\n\n\"Of Refuge Islands, daddy,\" said Pina; \"pass the toast, Otto, I think I\nnever _was_ so hungry.  Coming home obviously improves one's appetite.\"\n\n\"You forget the open boat, Pina.\"\n\n\"Ah, true,\" returned Pauline, \"I did for a moment forget that.  Yes, we\nwere fearfully hungry _that_ time.\"\n\nOf course this led to further inquiry, and to Dominick clearing his\nthroat at last, and saying--\"Come, I'll give you a short outline of our\nadventures since we left home.  It must only be a mere sketch, of\ncourse, because it would take days and weeks to give you all the\ndetails.\"\n\n\"Don't be prosy, Dom,\" said Otto, helping himself to a fifth, if not a\ntenth, muffin.  \"Prosiness is one of your weak points when left to your\nown promptings.\"\n\n\"But before you begin, Dom,\" said old Mr Rigonda, \"tell us where Refuge\nIslands are.\"\n\n\"In the Southern Pacific, father.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" observed Otto; \"at the bottom of the Southern Pacific.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" exclaimed the old gentleman, whose incredulity was fast taking\nthe form of sarcasm.  \"Not far, I suppose, from that celebrated island\nwhich was the last home and refuge of our famous ancestor, the Spanish\npirate, who was distantly related, through a first cousin of his mother,\nto Don Quixote.\"\n\n\"You doubt us, daddy, I see,\" said Pauline, laughing; \"but I do assure\nyou we are telling you the simple truth.  I appeal to Dr Marsh.\"\n\nDr Marsh, who had chiefly acted the part of observant listener up to\nthat moment, now assured Mr Rigonda with so much sincerity that what\nhad been told him was true, that he felt bound to believe him.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Dr Marsh, \"your daughter was in truth a queen, and\nI was one of her subjects.  Indeed, I may say that, in one sense, she is\na queen still, but she has been dethroned by fire and water, as you\nshall presently hear, though she still reigns in the affections of her\npeople, and can _never_ be dethroned again!\"\n\nThis speech was greeted with some merriment, for the doctor said it with\nmuch enthusiasm.  Then Dominick began to give an account of their\nadventures, interrupted and corrected, not infrequently, by his pert\nbrother Otto, who, being still afflicted with his South-Sea-island\nappetite, remained unsatisfied until the last slice of toast, and the\nlast muffin, and the last wedge of cake had disappeared from the table.\n\nDominick's intentions were undoubtedly good; and when he asserted that\nit was his purpose to give his father and mother merely an outline of\ntheir adventures, he was unquestionably sincere; but the outline became\nso extended, and assumed such a variety of complex convolutions, that\nthere seemed to be no end to the story--as there certainly seemed to be\nno end to the patience of the listeners.  So Dominick went, \"on and on\nand on,\" as story-books put it, until the fire in the grate began to\nburn low; until Otto had consumed the contents of the teapot, and the\ncream-jug, and the sugar-basin, and had even gathered up, economically,\nthe crumbs of the cake; until the still eager audience had begun to yawn\nconsiderately with shut mouths; until the household cat, lost in\namazement at prolonged neglect, had ventured to creep from the\ncoal-hole, and take up a modest position on the floor, in the shadow of\nits little old mistress.\n\nThere is no saying how long this state of things would have gone on, if\nit had not been for the exuberant spirits of Otto, who, under an impulse\nof maternal affection, sprang to his mother's side with intent to\nembrace her, and unwittingly planted his foot on the cat's tail.\n\nThen, indeed, the convoluted outline came to an abrupt end; for, with a\nvolcanic explosion, suggestive of thunder and lightning, inlaid with\ndynamite, the hapless creature sprang from the room, followed by a\nshriek from its mistress, and a roar of laughter from all the rest.\n\nIt is not certainly known where that cat spent the following fortnight.\nThe only thing about it that remains on record is the fact that, at the\nend of that space of time, it returned to its old haunts, deeply\nhumbled, and much reduced; that it gradually became accustomed to the\nnew state of things, and even mounted the table, and sat blinking in its\nold position, and grew visibly fatter, while the old lady revived old\ntimes by stroking it, as she had been wont to, and communicating to it\nsome of her thoughts and fancies.\n\n\"Ay, pussy,\" she said, on one of these occasions when they chanced to be\nalone together, \"little did you and I think, when we used to be sitting\nso comfortably here, that our darlings were being tossed about and\nstarved in open boats on the stormy sea!  Ah! pussy, pussy, we little\nknew--but `it's all well that ends well,' as a great writer that you\nknow nothing about has said, and you and I can never, never be thankful\nenough for getting back, safe and sound, our dear old man, and our\ndarling boys, and our--our little Pauline, the Island Queen.\"\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Island Queen, by R.M.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":669,"split":"train"}
