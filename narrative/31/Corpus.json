{"ori_id":"07115dadb9d1831d9a0951dd1c392587dfcae9df","title":"The Helpers","context":"The Helpers\n The film opens with a scene of newspapers and news broadcasts describing an orphanage which was burned down, resulting in several deaths. It then turns to seven friends as they start out on a road trip to Las Vegas, with Phil (JoJo Wright) recording the trip for his girlfriend Julia. The group hits a road block en route to their destination, prompting them to take a detour that results in several flat tires. The group decides that the women will remain behind to watch the truck while the men go to look for help. The men eventually come across a rest-stop motel that sells tires, introducing themselves to the gas attendant Brad and the shop owner Steve (Braxton Davis) and Norah (Dallas Lovato). Steve offers to not only fix the truck and pick up the girls, but to provide free alcoholic drinks, in addition to letting the group stay at the neighboring motel for the night. One of the group members, Todd (Dustin Harnish), is originally hesitant about the proposition, but eventually agrees to it. After a wild night of drinking and partying, the group falls asleep in the motel.\nThe group eventually wakes up the next morning\/afternoon. At first everything appears normal, but it soon becomes clear that Steve and his cohorts are nowhere to be found on the premises. None of the friends remembers much about what happened the previous night. And four of the friends (Jordan, Brandy, Ryan, Andy) wake up realizing they're tied up or otherwise physically incapacitated. Jordan is tied up to a chair in the bathroom next to the bathtub, with a bucket on his arm and an electric wire tied to his hand. Brandy is tied up in the bathtub. Ryan is tied to a chair in his room, and Anna is tied up on the bed, at her hands and her feet. At first the friends believe this to be some sort of bad joke, but when Todd and Claire witness Phil being intentionally decapitated by Brad, it becomes clear that Steve, Brad, Norah and Chloe are actually cruel, sadistic sociopaths, (who call themselves \"the helpers\") intent on torturing and murdering the group. Claire (Kristen Quintrall) and Todd are locked in their motel room and are forced to watch while their friends get murdered one by one. The helpers go into Anna and Ryan's room and reveal that each end of Anna's body is chained to a car, and they will drive the cars and rip her body in half. They do so, while Ryan is tied up and unable to stop them. They then go into Jordan and Brandy's room and explain that the wire attached to Jordan's arm will be lowered into the water in the bathtub by placing rocks in the bucket hanging from his arm, electrocuting Brandy. Brandy is presumed to be killed (actually just knocked out) from being electrocuted four times, while Jordan's arm with the wire was forcibly placed in the water. The men remove Brandy from the tub and leave Jordan with Norah. Norah taunts Jordan, who then pushes Norah into the tub and electrocutes her with the wire, killing her. He then checks to see if Brandy is still alive and after reviving her, they both escape. Todd and Claire also manage to successfully escape from their room. However, Todd and Claire are caught while attempting to flee and are brought back to the complex. The helpers bring out Ryan (still tied to the chair) and shoot him dead in front of the others, and then chain Claire to the cars as they did to Anna, threatening to rip her body in half, unless she admits that her father was the abusive owner of an orphanage. She admits that her father was indeed the owner of an orphanage. It's eventually revealed that the three murderers used to live in an orphanage run by Claire's father where they were terribly abused and beaten, with the murderers intentionally setting the group up to come by the motel. They found the motel\/gas station, killed the employees, and took it over. Then they placed road detour signs on the road, and placed sharp objects to puncture the cars tires. It is also revealed that before they left the orphanage, they burned it down, as the news described in the opening scene of the movie. Hence, the murderers main motive for their barbarism is revenge against Claire's father. They knew that the group was going on a road trip because Phil's girlfriend, Julia, was one of them. Jordan, Brandy, Todd, and Claire manage to escape. The film ends with a scene \"six months later\" where \"the helpers\" are working at another gas station, asking their customers if they need any help.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Helpers, by Francis Lynde\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

His place was the fourth from the\naisle, and after an ineffectual attempt to make a passageway for him\nwithout rising, the two young women and the elderly man stood up and\nfolded their opera chairs. Being driven to think pointedly of something\nelse, Jeffard neglected to acknowledge the courtesy; and the two young\nwomen balanced the account by discussing him after he had passed out of\nhearing.\n\n\"I think he might at least have said 'Thank you,'\" protested the one\nin the black-plumed picture-hat, preening herself after the manner\nof ruffled birds and disturbed womankind. \"I'm in love with your\nmountains, and your climate, and your end-of-the-century impetus, but I\ncan't say that I particularly admire Denver manners.\"\n\nThe clear-eyed young woman in the modest toque laughed joyously.\n\n\"Go on, Myra dear; don't mind me. It's so refreshing to hear an\nout-of-church opinion on one's self. I know our manners are perfectly\nprimitive, but what can you expect when every train from the East\nbrings us a new lot of people to civilize? When you are tempted to\ngroan over our shortcomings it'll comfort you wonderfully if you will\njust stop long enough to remember that a good many of us are the newest\nof new tenderfoots!\"\n\n\"Tenderfoots! What an expression!\"\n\n\"It's good English, though we did use to say 'tenderfeet' before the\n'Century Dictionary' set us right. And it calls the turn, as poppa\nwould say.\"\n\nShe of the far-reaching plumes bent her eyebrows in severe deprecation.\n\n\"Connie, your slang is simply vicious. Will you be good enough to tell\nme what 'calls the turn' means?\"\n\n\"Ask poppa.\"\n\nAppealed to by the censorious one, the elderly man stopped twiddling\nthe bit of gold quartz on his watch-guard long enough to explain. He\ndid it with a little hesitancy, picking his way among the words as one\nmight handle broken glass, or the edged tools of an unfamiliar trade.\nHe was a plain man, and he stood in considerable awe of the picture-hat\nand its wearer. When he had finished, the toque made honorable amends.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Myra. Really, I didn't know it had anything to\ndo with gambling. But to go back to our manners: I'll give you the\nponies and the phaeton if I don't convince you that the absent-minded\ngentleman on our left here is the tenderest of tenderfoots--most\nprobably from Philadelphia, too,\" she added, in mischievous\nafterthought.\n\n\"You wouldn't dare!\"\n\n\"You think not? Just wait and you'll see. Oh, cousin mine, you've a lot\nto learn about your kind, yet. If you stay out here six months or a\nyear, you will begin to think your philosophy hasn't been half dreamful\nenough.\"\n\n\"How absurd you are, Constance. If I didn't know you to be\"--\n\n\"Wait a minute; let me start you off right: good, and sensible, and\nmodest, and unassuming, and dutiful, and brimful of fads\"--she checked\nthe attributes off on her fingers. \"You see I have them all by heart.\"\n\nThe little cloud of dust puffing from beneath the drop-curtain began to\nsubside, and the thumping and rumbling on the stage died away what time\nthe musicians were clambering back to their places in the orchestra.\nMiss Van Vetter swept the aisles and the standing-room with her\nopera-glass.\n\n\"You will not have a chance to prove it, Connie. He isn't coming back.\"\n\n\"Don't you believe it. I am quite sure he is a gentleman who always\ngets the worth of his money.\"\n\n\"What makes you say that?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know; intuition, I suppose. That's what they call it in a\nwoman, though I think it would be called good judgment in a man.\"\n\nTaking him at his worst, Miss Elliott's terse characterization of\nHenry Jeffard was not altogether inaccurate, though, in the present\ninstance, he would not have gone back to the theatre if he had known\nwhat else to do with himself. Indeed, he was minded not to go back, but\na turn in the open air made him think better of it, and he strolled in\nas the curtain was rising. Whereupon the elderly man and the two young\nwomen had to stand again while he edged past them to his chair.\n\nThis time he remembered, and said something about being sorry to\ntrouble them. Miss Elliott's chair was next to his, and she smiled and\nnodded reassuringly. Jeffard was moody and disheartened, and the nod\nand the smile went near to the better part of him. He kept his seat\nduring the next intermission, and ventured a civil commonplace about\nthe opera. The young woman replied in kind, and the wheel thus set in\nmotion soon rolled away from the beaten track of trivialities into a\npath leading straight to the fulfillment of Miss Elliott's promise to\nher cousin.\n\n\"Then you haven't been long in Denver,\" she hazarded on the strength of\na remark which betrayed his unfamiliarity with Colorado.\n\n\"Only a few weeks.\"\n\n\"And you like it? Every one does, you know.\"\n\nJeffard tried to look decorously acquiescent and made a failure of it.\n\n\"I suppose I ought to be polite and say yes; but for once in a way, I'm\ngoing to be sincere and say no.\"\n\n\"You surprise me! I thought everybody, and especially new-comers, liked\nDenver; enthusiastically at first, and rather more than less afterward.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I am the exception,\" he suggested, willing to concede\nsomething. \"I fancy it depends very much upon the point of view. To be\nbrutally frank about it, I came here--like some few hundreds of others,\nI presume--to make my fortune; and I think I would better have stayed\nat home. I seem to have arrived a decade or two after the fact.\"\n\nThe young woman never swerved from her intention by a hair's-breadth.\n\n\"Yes?\" she queried. \"It's too true that these are not the palmy days of\nthe 'Matchless' and the 'Little Pittsburg,' notwithstanding Creede and\nCripple Creek. And yet it would seem that even now our Colorado is a\nfairer field for ambition and energy than\"--\n\nShe paused, and Jeffard, with an unanalyzed impression that it was\nboth very singular and very pleasant to be talking thus freely with a\nself-contained young woman whose serenity was apparently undisturbed\nby any notions of conventionality, said, \"Than a city of the fifth\nclass in New England, let us say. Yes, I concede that, if you include\nambition; but when it comes to a plain question of earning a living\"--\n\n\"Oh, as to that,\" she rejoined, quite willing to argue with him now\nthat her point was gained, \"if it is merely a question of getting\nenough to eat and drink I suppose that can be answered anywhere. Even\nthe Utes managed to answer it here before the Government began feeding\nthem.\"\n\nHe regarded her curiously, trying to determine her social point of\nview by the many little outward signs of prosperity which tasteful\nsimplicity, unhampered by a lean purse, may exhibit.\n\n\"I wonder if you know anything at all about it,\" he said, half musingly.\n\n\"About getting something to eat?\" Her laugh was a ripple of pure joy\nthat had the tonic of the altitudes in it. \"I dare say I don't--not in\nany practical way; though I do go about among our poor people. That is\nwhat makes me uncharitable. I can't help knowing why so many people\nhave to go hungry.\"\n\nJeffard winced as if the uncharity had a personal application.\n\n\"We were speaking of fortunes,\" he corrected, calmly ignoring the fact\nthat his own remark had brought up the question of the struggle for\nexistence. \"I think my own case is a fair example of what comes of\nchasing ambitious phantoms. I gave up a modest certainty at home to\ncome here, and\"--The musicians were taking their places again, and he\nstopped abruptly.\n\n\"And now?\" The words uttered themselves, and she was sorry for them\nwhen they were beyond recall.\n\nHis gesture was expressive of disgust, but there was no resentment in\nhis reply.\n\n\"That was some time ago, as I have intimated; and I am still here and\nbeginning to wish very heartily that I had never come. I presume you\ncan infer the rest.\"\n\nThe leader lifted his baton, and the curtain rose on the third act\nof the opera. At the same moment the curtain of unacquaintance,\ndrawn aside a hand's-breadth by the young woman's curiosity, fell\nbetween these two who knew not so much as each other's names, and who\nassumed--if either of them thought anything about it--that the wave of\nchance which had tossed them together would presently sweep them apart\nagain.\n\nAfter the opera the ebbing tide of humanity did so separate them; but\nwhen the man had melted into the crowd in the foyer, the young woman\nhad a curious little thrill of regret; a twinge of remorse born of\nthe recollection that she had made him open the book of his life to a\nstranger for the satisfying of a mere whim of curiosity.\n\nMiss Van Vetter was ominously silent on the way home, but she made it\na point of conscience to go to Constance's room before her cousin had\ngone to bed.\n\n\"Connie Elliott,\" she began, \"you deserve to be shaken! How did you\ndare to talk with that young man without knowing the first syllable\nabout him?\"\n\nConstance sat down on the edge of the bed and laughed till the tears\ncame.\n\n\"Oh, Myra dear,\" she gasped, \"it's worth any amount of disgrace to see\nyou ruffle your feathers so beautifully. Don't you see that I talked to\nhim just because I didn't know any of the syllables? And he told me a\nlot of them.\"\n\n\"I should think he did. I suppose he will call on you next.\"\n\nConnie the unconventional became Miss Elliott in the smallest\nappreciable lapse of time. \"Indeed, he will not. He knows better than\nto do that, even if he is a ten--\"\n\nBut Miss Van Vetter was gone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nWHEN Jeffard left the theatre he went to his room; but not directly. He\nmade a detour of a few squares which took him down Sixteenth Street to\nLarimer, and so on around to his lodging, which was in the neighborhood\nof the St. James hotel.\n\nAfter the manner of those whose goings and comings have reached the\naccusative point, he took the trouble to assure himself that the\nburning of a cigar in the open air was the excuse for the roundabout\nwalk; but the real reason showed its head for a moment or two when he\nslackened his pace at one point in the circuit and glanced furtively up\nat a row of carefully shaded windows in the second story of a building\non the opposite side of the street.\n\nThe lower part of the building was dark and deserted; but in the alley\nthere was a small hallway screened by a pair of swing doors with glass\neyes in them, and at the end of the hallway a carpeted stair leading up\nto the lighted room above. It was to keep from climbing this stair that\nJeffard had gone to the theatre earlier in the evening.\n\nOpposite the alley he stopped and made as if he would cross the street,\nbut the impulse seemed to expend itself in the moment of hesitation,\nand he went on again, slowly, as one to whom dubiety has lent its\nleaden-soled shoes. Reaching his room he lighted the gas and dropped\ninto a chair, his hands deep-buried in his pockets, and a look of\nsomething like desperation in his eyes.\n\nThe suggestive outline of his Western experience sketched between the\nacts of the opera for the young woman with the reassuring smile was\nmade up of half-truths, as such confidences are wont to be. It was true\nthat he had come to Colorado to seek his fortune, and that thus far\nthe quest had been bootless. But it was also true that he had begun by\npersuading himself that he must first study his environment; and that\nthe curriculum which he had chosen was comprehensive, exhaustive, and\ncostly enough to speedily absorb the few thousand dollars which were to\nhave been his lure for success.\n\nHis walk in life hitherto had been decently irreproachable, hedged in\non either hand by such good habits as may be formed by the attrition\nof a moral community; but since these were more the attributes of time\nand place than of the man, and were unconsciously left behind in the\nleave-takings, a species of insanity, known only to those who have\nhabitually worn the harness of self-restraint, had come upon him in the\nnew environment. At first it had been but a vagrant impulse, and as\nsuch he had suffered it to put a bandage on the eyes of reason. Later,\nwhen he would fain have removed the bandage, he found it tied in a hard\nknot.\n\nFor the hundredth time within a month he was once more tugging at the\nknot. To give himself the benefit of an object-lesson, he turned his\npockets inside out, throwing together a small heap of loose silver and\ncrumpled bank-notes on the table. After which he made a deliberate\naccounting, smoothing the creases out of the bills, and building an\naccurate little pillar with the coins. The exact sum ascertained, he\nsat back and regarded the money reflectively.\n\n\"Ninety-five dollars and forty-five cents. That's what there is left\nout of the nest-egg; and I've been here rather less than four months.\nAt that rate I've averaged, let me see\"--he knitted his brows and made\nan approximate calculation--\"say, fifty dollars a day. Consequently,\nthe mill will run out of grist in less than two days, or it would if\nthe law of averages held good--which it doesn't, in this case. Taking\nthe last fortnight as a basis, I'm capitalized for just about one hour\nlonger.\"\n\nHe looked at his watch and got up wearily. \"It's Kismet,\" he mused.\n\"I might as well take my hour now, and be done with it.\" Whereupon he\nrolled the money into a compact little bundle, turned off the gas, and\nfelt his way down the dark stair to the street.\n\nAt the corner he ran against a stalwart young fellow, gloved and\novercoated, and carrying a valise.\n\n\"Why, hello, Jeffard, old man,\" said the traveler heartily, stopping to\nshake hands. \"Doing time on the street at midnight, as usual, aren't\nyou? When do you ever catch up on your sleep?\"\n\nJeffard's laugh was perfunctory. \"I don't have much to do but eat and\nsleep,\" he replied. \"Have you been somewhere?\"\n\n\"Yes; just got down from the mine--train was late. Same old story with\nyou, I suppose? Haven't found the barrel of money rolling up hill yet?\"\n\nJeffard shook his head.\n\n\"Jeff, you're an ass--that's what you are; a humpbacked burro of the\nSaguache, at that! You come out here in the morning of a bad year with\na piece of sheepskin in your grip, and the Lord knows what little\npickings of civil engineering in your head, and camp down in Denver\nexpecting your lucky day to come along and slap you in the face. Why\ndon't you come up on the range and take hold with your hands?\"\n\n\"Perhaps I'll have to before I get through,\" Jeffard admitted; and\nthen: \"Don't abuse me to-night, Bartrow. I've about all I can carry.\"\n\nThe stalwart one put his free arm about his friend and swung him around\nto the light.\n\n\"And that isn't the worst of it,\" he went on, ignoring Jeffard's\nprotest. \"You've been monkeying with the fire and getting your fingers\nburned; and, as a matter of course, making ducks and drakes of your\nlittle stake. Drop it all, Jeffard, and come across to the St. James\nand smoke a cigar with me.\"\n\n\"I can't to-night, Bartrow. I'm in a blue funk, and I've got to walk it\noff.\"\n\n\"Blue nothing! You'll walk about two blocks, more or less, and then\nyou'll pull up a chair and proceed to burn your fingers some more. Oh,\nI know the symptoms like a book.\"\n\nJeffard summoned his dignity, and found some few shreds and patches of\nit left. \"Bartrow, there is such a thing as overdrawing one's account\nwith a friend,\" he returned stiffly. \"I don't want to quarrel with you.\nGood-night.\"\n\nThree minutes later the goggle-eyed swing doors opened and engulfed\nhim. At the top of the carpeted stair he met a hard-faced man who was\ndoubling a thick sheaf of bank-notes into portable shape. The outgoer\nnodded, and tapped the roll significantly. \"Go in and break 'em,\" he\nrasped. \"The bank's out o' luck to-night, and it's our rake-off. I win\nall I can stand.\"\n\nJeffard pushed through another swing door and went to the faro-table.\nCounting his money he dropped the odd change back into his pocket and\nhanded the bills to the banker.\n\n\"Ninety-five?\" queried the man; and when Jeffard nodded, he pushed the\nrequisite number of blue, red, and white counters across the table.\nJeffard arranged them in a symmetrical row in front of him, and began\nto play with the singleness of purpose which is the characteristic of\nthat particular form of dementia.\n\nIt was the old story with the usual variations. He lost, won, and then\nlost again until he could reckon his counters by units. After which the\ntide turned once more, and the roar of its flood dinned in his ears\nlike the drumming of a tornado in a forest. His capital grew by leaps\nand bounds, doubling, trebling, and finally quadrupling the sum he had\nhanded the banker. Then his hands began to shake, and the man on his\nright paused in his own play long enough to say, \"Now's yer time to\ncash in, pardner. Yer nerve's a-flickerin'.\"\n\nThe prudent advice fell upon deaf ears. Jeffard's soul was Berserk\nin the fierce battle with chance, and he began placing the counters\nupon certain of the inlaid cards before him, stopping only when he had\nstaked his last dollar. Five minutes afterward he was standing on the\nsidewalk again, drawing in deep breaths of the keen morning air, and\nwondering if it were only the possession of the thing called money that\nkept one's head from buzzing ordinarily. In the midst of the unspoken\nquery the shuffling figure of a night tramp sidled up to him, and he\nheard imperfectly the stereotyped appeal.\n\n\"Hungry, you say? Perhaps I'll be that, myself, before long. Here you\nare.\"\n\nThe odd change jingled into the outstretched palm of the vagrant, and\nfor the first time in a fairly industrious life Jeffard knew what it\nfelt like to be quite without money.\n\n\"That is, I think I do, but I don't,\" he mused, walking slowly in the\ndirection of his room. \"It isn't breakfast-time yet; and by the same\ntoken, it isn't going to be for a good while. I believe I can sleep the\nclock around, now that I've reached the bottom.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nWHEN one has sown the wind, and the whirlwind harvest is begun, it\nis easy to imagine that the first few strokes of the sickle have\ngathered in all the bitterness there is in the crop. Some such illusory\nassumption lent itself to Jeffard's mood when he assured himself that\nhe had finally reached the bottom; but the light of a new day, and a\nhabit of early rising which was not to be broken at such short notice,\nbrought a clearer perspective.\n\nIn lieu of breakfast he walked up one street and down another,\ncarefully avoiding the vicinity of the St. James for fear Bartrow might\noffer him hospitality, and dodging the haunts of his few acquaintances\nin the downtown thoroughfares for the same reason. This drove him to\nthe residence district; and out in Colfax Avenue he met the elderly man\nwhom he had taken to be the father of the young woman with the kindly\nnod and smile.\n\nSeeing him in daylight, Jeffard recognized a familiar figure of the\nMining Exchange and the brokers' offices, and thought it not unlikely\nthat he might presently stumble upon the home of the young woman. He\nfound it a square or two farther out, identifying it by a glimpse\nof the young woman herself, who was on the veranda, looping up the\ntendrils of a climbing rose.\n\nAt sight of her Jeffard forgot his penalties for the moment, and the\nearly morning sunshine seemed to take on a kindlier glow. She was\nstanding on the arm of a clumsy veranda-chair, trying vainly to reach\nthe higher branches of the rose, and Jeffard remarked that she was\nsmall almost to girlishness. But the suggestion of immaturity paused\nwith her stature. The rounded arms discovered by the loose sleeves\nof her belted house-gown; the firm, full outline of her figure; the\ncrowning glory of red-brown hair with the heart of the sunlight in it;\nthe self-contained poise on the arm of the great chair; these were all\nwomanly, and the glimpse stirred the waters of a neglected pool in\nJeffard's past as he went on his aimless way along the avenue.\n\nThere was a closely written leaf in the book of memory which he had\nsought to tear out and destroy; but the sight of the graceful figure\npoised on the arm of the big chair opened the record at the forbidden\npage, and the imagined personality of the sweet-faced young woman with\nthe red-brown hair and sympathetic eyes set itself antithetically over\nagainst the self-seeking ambition of the girl who had written her own\nepitaph in the book of his remembrance. He gave place to the sharply\ndefined contrast for a time, indulging it as one who plunges not\nunwillingly into the past for the sake of escaping the present, and\nbanishing it only when his shortening shadow gave token that the chance\nof a breakfast invitation was no longer to be apprehended.\n\nBut when he turned his face cityward it was with a conscious avoidance\nof the route which would lead him past the house with a climbing\nrose on one of its veranda pillars. For what had a man to whom the\nproletary's highway was already opening up its cheerless vista to do\nwith love, and dalliance, and heaven-suggestive pictures of domestic\nbeatitude?\n\nOnce more in Sixteenth Street, the moneyless reality thrust itself\nupon him with renewed insistence, and he turned a corner abruptly to\nescape an acquaintance who was crossing the street. The shame of it was\ntoo new to strike hands with dissimulation as yet, and companionship\nwas least of all things to be desired. If he could but win back to\nhis room unaccosted and lock himself in until the sharpness of hunger\nshould have exorcised the devil of humiliation, he might hope to be\nable to face an accusing world with such equanimity as may be born of\ndesperation.\n\nBut fate willed otherwise. As he was passing a deep-set doorway giving\non the sidewalk, a friendly arm shot out and barred the way. Jeffard\nlooked up with an unspoken malediction on his tongue. It was Bartrow.\nIn his haste to gain his lodging the shamed one had forgotten the\nproximity of the St. James hotel.\n\n\"You're a chump!\" declared the broad-shouldered young miner, backing\nJeffard against the wall and pinning him fast with one finger. \"You're\nno man's man, and you're not fit to live in a man's town. Why didn't\nyou come around to breakfast this morning, like decent people?\"\n\n\"I'm not boarding at the St. James now.\" Jeffard tried to say it\nnaturally, but the evasion was palpable enough.\n\n\"What of that? Couldn't you afford to be sociable once in a way?\"\n\nJeffard prevaricated, and since he was but a clumsy liar, contrived to\nfall into a snare of his own setting.\n\n\"I was up too early for you, I guess. When I came by, the clerk told me\nyou weren't down yet.\"\n\nBartrow shook his head and appeared to be much moved.\n\n\"What an abnormal liar that clerk must be,\" he commented reflectively.\n\"I asked him five minutes ago if any one had inquired for me, and he\nsaid no.\"\n\nJeffard hung his head and would have tried to break away; but Bartrow\nlocked arms with him and dragged him whither he would.\n\n\"I'll forgive you this time,\" he went on, laughing at Jeffard's\ndiscomfiture. \"I suppose you had your reasons for dodging, and while\nit's ten to one they were no good, that leaves one chance in your\nfavor. Have a smoke?\"\n\nNow Jeffard's poverty-pride was fire-new as yet, and though the smell\nof Bartrow's cigar made him faint with desire, he refused the gift.\n\n\"Haven't quit, have you?\" Bartrow demanded.\n\n\"No--yes; that is, I have for the present. I'm not feeling very well\nthis morning.\"\n\n\"You look it; every inch of it. Let's go around and see what the money\npeople are doing. Maybe that'll chirk you up a bit.\"\n\nJeffard yielded, partly because Bartrow's impetus was always of the\nirresistible sort, and partly because he could think of no plausible\nobjection on the spur of the moment. Bartrow talked cheerily all the\nway around to the Mining Exchange, telling of his claims and prospects\nin Chaffee County, and warming to his subject as only a seasoned\nColoradoan can when the talk is of \"mineral\" and mining. Jeffard, being\nhungry, and sick with a fierce longing for tobacco, said little, and\nwas duly thankful that Bartrow required no more than a word now and\nthen to keep him going. None the less he watched narrowly for a chance\nto escape, and was visibly depressed when none offered.\n\nIn the crowded Exchange the poverty-pride began to lose the fine\nkeenness of its edge. The atmosphere of the room was pungent with cigar\nsmoke, and the tobacco craving rose up in its might and smote down\nJeffard's self-respect.\n\n\"If you'll excuse me a minute, Dick, I believe I'll go out and get a\ncigar as a measure of self-defense,\" he said; and Bartrow supplied\nhis need, as a matter of course. It was a shameful subterfuge, and he\nloathed himself for having descended to it. Nevertheless, he took the\ncigar which Bartrow made haste to offer, and lighted it. The first few\nwhiffs made him dizzy, but afterward he was better company for the\nenthusiast.\n\nWhile they were talking, the elderly man with the bit of quartz on his\nwatch-chain came in, and Jeffard inquired if Bartrow knew him.\n\n\"Know Steve Elliott? I should say I do. Everybody knows him, barring\nnow and then a tenderfoot like yourself. Besides being one of the most\nlovable old infants on top of earth, he's one of Denver's picturesques.\nThat old man has had more ups and downs than any three men in Colorado;\nand that's saying a good deal.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"Oh, every way. He's a Fifty-niner, to begin with; came across the\nplains in a bull-train to hunt for mineral. He found it--Steve would\nfind it if anybody could--but some sharp rascal euchred him out of it,\nand he's been finding it and losing it at regular intervals ever since.\"\n\nJeffard blew a cloud of smoke toward the ceiling, and took in the\noutward presentment of the pioneer in an appraisive eye-sweep. \"This is\none of the finding intervals, I take it.\"\n\n\"Sure. He's on top just now,--rather more so than usual, I\nbelieve,--but the 'pioneer's luck' will catch him again some day, and\njust as likely as not he'll be hustling around for a grub-stake.\"\n\n\"Man of family?\" queried Jeffard.\n\n\"Yes, if a daughter's a family. His wife died in one of the lean years\na long time ago. But say, Jeffard, you ought to know the daughter.\nShe's as pretty as a peach, and as bright as a new nickel. She's had\nher share of the ups and downs, and they've made a queer little medley\nof her. Trap and tandem and a big house on Capitol Hill one month, and\nas like as not two rooms in a block and a ride in the street-cars\nthe next. That's about the way Connie Elliott's had it all her life,\nand it's made her as wide awake as a frosty morning, and as good as a\nSister of Charity.\"\n\n\"I can believe all that,\" Jeffard admitted, meaning more than he said.\n\n\"Yes, you're safe in believing all the good things you hear about Steve\nElliott and his daughter. They're good people. By the way, why can't\nyou come up to the house with me some evening and get acquainted?\nThey've a Philadelphia cousin staying with them now, and you might\ncompare notes on the 'wild and woolly' with her.\"\n\nJeffard had a string of excuses ready, ending with, \"Besides, there\nare particular reasons why I don't wish to meet Miss Elliott just\nnow--reasons that I can't explain.\"\n\n\"Reasons be hanged! Just you stand still a minute while I go get the\nold man and introduce you. You'll like him a whole lot.\"\n\nBartrow did his part, but by the time he had pulled Elliott out of the\nthrong in front of the quotation board, Jeffard was two squares away,\nheaded once more for the suburbs. This time he crossed the river and\ntramped for hours in the Highlands. He told himself he was killing time\nand keeping out of the way of the luncheon hour; but in reality he was\nfighting a desperate battle with pride, or self-respect, or whatever\nit is that makes a man who is not a born vagrant shrink from that\nspecies of cannibalism which begins with the eating of one's personal\npossessions.\n\nIt was an unequal fight at best, since hunger was the besieger, but\nJeffard made shift to prolong it until the long day of fasting was\ndrawing to its close. He yielded at last, as needs must when famine\ndrives, but the capitulation was upon conditions, and his heart\nwas soft with repentant kneadings. Since one must eat to live, the\npride-quenching thing must come to pass; but the doing of it should\nbe the pivot upon which he would turn back to sanity and industrious\nthrift. The loss of his small patrimony and the hard-earned savings\nby which it had been fairly doubled was shrewd upon him, but he told\nhimself that the consequences of his folly must be set over against the\nexperience; that he must be content to begin again at the bottom, as\nhis father had before him, thankful for the youth and strength which\nmade such a beginning possible.\n\nFrom the preliminary survey of penitence to plotting out the map of\ngood intentions is an easy stage, and Jeffard beguiled the long tramp\ntownward by building air-castles spacious and many-storied, with the\nnew resolutions for their foundations. But when the sidewalks of the\nstreets were once more under his feet, the pride-quenching necessity\nurged itself afresh, plying the lash of shame until he was driven to\ntramp yet other squares before he could attain to the plunging point.\n\nHe was passing the Albany when the climax was reached, and he turned\naside to get a light for the carefully economized stump of Bartrow's\ncigar before setting out to find a pawnshop where his pride might\nsuffer least. At the cigar counter in the rotunda a giant in rough\ntweeds, with an unshorn beard and the fine bronze of the grazing plains\non face and hands, was filling his case with high-priced Cubans from an\nopen box. At sight of Jeffard he dropped the cigar-case and roared out\na mighty welcome.\n\n\"Well, I'll be ----! Jeffard, my boy, where under the canopy did you\ndrop from? If I haven't had a search-warrant out for you all day, I'm\na liar and the truth has shook me. Been to dinner?--but of course you\nhaven't; or if you have, you are going to eat another with me right\nnow. How've you been? and where in Tophet have you been hiding out?\"\n\nJeffard smiled. \"That's the place--in Tophet and elsewhere; but I\nhaven't been out of town since you were here last.\"\n\n\"The devil you haven't! Then what did that muley maverick at the hotel\nmean when he said you were gone?\"\n\n\"Gone from the hotel, I guess he meant. I've been 'eating around,' as\nwe used to say back in the Berkshire Hills.\"\n\n\"Have, eh? Well, you're going to 'eat around' with me to-night, savez?\nI was just going to swear a few lines and go up and eat by myself. Come\non; let's get a move. I've got a train-load of steers on the iron,\nand I'm due to chase 'em at eight-thirty. But before I forget it,\nhere\"--the big man found a compact little wad of bank-notes in his vest\npocket and thrust it into Jeffard's hand. \"I counted that out the next\nmorning and meant to give it back to you, but the thing got away from\nme slick and clean.\"\n\n\"Give it back to me?\" queried Jeffard, with a sudden swelling of the\nthroat that made his voice husky and tremulous, \"what is it?\"\n\n\"Why, it's the hundred I borrowed of you the last time we took in the\nmenagerie together. What's the matter with you? Don't tell me you\ndon't remember it, or I shall go kick myself around the block for an\nover-honest idiot!\"\n\nJeffard did not remember it; could but dimly recall the circumstances\nnow that he was reminded of them. The lending had been in a moment of\nsupreme excitement in the midst of a feverish attack of the dementia;\nthe loan was in celluloid counters, in fact, and not in legal tender at\nall. And having been made, it was swiftly lost sight of in the varying\nfortunes of the sitting. None the less, the return of it at the precise\nmoment when it was most needed drove the thankfulness to his eyes, and\nthe lights of the great rotunda swam in a misty haze when he thought of\nthe humiliating thing from which the small Providence had saved him.\n\n\"Pettigrew,\" he said, when he could trust himself to speak, \"you're\nan honest man, and that's the worst that can be said of you. I had\nforgotten it long ago. Take me in and fill me up. I've been tramping\nall day, and it runs in my mind that I've skipped a meal or two.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nTHE dancing party at the Calmaines' was a crush, as Mrs. Calmaine's\nsocial enlargements were wont to be. For an hour or more the avenue\nhad been a-rumble with carriages coming and going, and a trickling\nstream of bidden ones flowed steadily inward under the electric-lighted\nawning, which extended the welcome of the hospitable house to the very\ncurb.\n\nThanks to Myra Van Vetter, whose tiring was always of the most\nleisurely, the Elliotts were fashionably late; and the elderly man,\nwith the hesitant air accentuated by the unwonted dress-coat, had much\nado to win through the throng in the drawing-rooms with his charges.\nHis greeting to the hostess was sincere rather than well-turned in its\nphrasing; but Mrs. Calmaine was sweetly gracious.\n\n\"_So_ glad to see you, Stephen,\" she protested; \"the old friends can\nnever be spared, you know.\" She shook hands with unaffected cordiality,\nand her tactful use of the elderly man's Christian name went far toward\neffacing the afflictive dress-coat. \"Miss Van Vetter, you are quite\nradiant to-night. You spoil all one's ideals of Quaker demureness.\"\n\n\"Oh, Myra's demure enough, only you have to be her country cousin to\nfind it out,\" put in Connie maliciously; and when her father and Miss\nVan Vetter had made room for later comers, she waited for another word\nwith the hostess.\n\n\"Just a hint, before I'm submerged,\" she began, when her opportunity\ncame. \"I'm unattached, and particularly good-natured and docile\nto-night. Make use of me just as you would of Delia or Bessie. You've\neverybody here, as usual, and if I can help you amuse people\"--\n\n\"Thank you, Connie, dear; that is very sweet of you. There are people\nhere to-night who seem not to belong to any one. Here comes one of them\nnow.\"\n\nConstance looked and saw a young man making his way toward them; a\nsoldierly figure, with square shoulders and the easy bearing of one who\nhas lived much in the open; but with a face which was rather thoughtful\nthan strong, though its lines were well masked under a close-trimmed\nbeard and virile mustaches. She recognized her unintroduced\nacquaintance of the theatre; and a minute or two afterward, when\nMrs. Calmaine would have presented the new-comer, Miss Elliott had\ndisappeared.\n\n\"Let's sit down here, Teddy; this is as good a place as any. You poor\nboy! it bores you dreadfully, doesn't it? How trying it must be to be\n_blas\u00c3\u00a9_ at--shall I say twenty? or is it twenty-one?\"\n\nThe dancing was two hours old, and Connie and the smooth-faced boy\nwho stood for the hopes of the house of Calmaine were sitting out the\nintermission on a broad step of the main stair.\n\n\"Oh, I'm young, but I'll outgrow that,\" rejoined the youth tolerantly.\n\"All the same, you needn't bully me because you've a month or two the\nadvantage. Shall I go and get you something to eat, or drink?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, Teddy; I'm neither hungry nor thirsty. But you might\ngive me the recipe for being good-natured when people make game of you.\"\n\n\"Yes; I think I see myself giving you points on that,\" said the boy,\nwith frank admiration in his eyes. \"I'm not running an angel-school\njust at present.\"\n\nConnie's blush was reproachful. \"You ridiculous boy!\" she retorted.\n\"You'll be making love to me next, just the same as if we hadn't known\neach other all our lives. Do you talk that way to other girls? or are\nyou only practicing on me so that you can?\"\n\nTeddy Calmaine shook his head. \"There isn't anybody else,\" he asserted,\nwith mock earnestness. \"My celestial acquaintance is too limited. When\nthe goddess goes, there are no half-goddesses to take her place.\"\n\nConnie sniffed sympathetically, and then laughed at him. \"You ought to\nhave seen me yesterday, when poppa brought old Jack Hawley home with\nhim. Poppa and Jack were partners in the 'Vesta,' and Mr. Hawley hadn't\nseen me since I was in pinafores. He called me 'little girl,' and\nwanted to know if I went to school, and how I was getting along!\"\n\nYoung Calmaine made a dumb show of applause. \"_O umbr\u00c3\u00a6 Pygm\u00c3\u00a6orum!_ Why\nwasn't I there to see! But you mustn't be too hard on old Jack. Half\nthe people here who don't know you think you're an escaped schoolgirl;\nI've heard 'em. That's why I took pity on you and\"--\n\n\"Teddy Calmaine, go away and find me somebody to talk to; a grown man,\nif you please. You make me tired.\"\n\nThe boy got up with a quizzical grin on his smooth face. \"I'll do it,\"\nhe assented affably; \"I'm no end good-natured, as you remarked a few\nminutes ago.\"\n\nWhen he was gone Connie forgot him, and fell into a muse, with the\nsights and sounds of the crush for its motive. From her perch on the\nstair she could look down on the shifting scene in the wide entrance\nhall, and through the archway beyond she had a glimpse of the circling\nfigures in the ball-room swaying rhythmically to the music. It was all\nvery delightful and joyous, and she enjoyed it with a zest which was\nyet undulled by satiety. None the less, the lavishness of it oppressed\nher, and a vague protest, born of other sights and scenes sharply\ncontrasted but no less familiar to the daughter of Stephen Elliott,\nbegan to shape itself in her heart. How much suffering a bare tithe\nof the wealth blazing here in jewels on fair hands and arms and necks\nwould alleviate. And how many hungry mouths might be filled from the\ngroaning tables in the supper-room.\n\nMiss Elliott came out of her reverie reluctantly at the bidding of her\nlate companion. Teddy Calmaine had obeyed her literally; and when she\nturned he was presenting the soldierly young man with the pointed beard\nand curling mustaches.\n\n\"Miss Elliott, this is Mr. Jeffard. You said you wanted a\"--\n\n\"An ice, Teddy,\" she cut in, with a look which was meant to be\nobliterative. \"But you needn't mind it now. Will you have half a\nstair-step, Mr. Jeffard?\"\n\nShe made room for him, but he was mindful of his obligations.\n\n\"Not if you will give me this waltz.\"\n\nShe glanced at her card and looked up at him with a smile which was\nhalf pleading and half quizzical. \"Must I?\"\n\nHe laughed and sat down beside her. \"There is no 'must' about it. I was\nhoping you would refuse.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you.\"\n\n\"For your sake rather than my own,\" he hastened to add. \"I am a\nwretched dancer.\"\n\n\"What a damaging admission!\"\n\n\"Is it? Do you know, I had hoped you wouldn't take that view of it.\"\n\n\"I don't,\" she admitted, quite frankly. \"We take it seriously,\nas we do most of our amusements, but it's a relic of barbarism.\nOnce, when I was a very little girl, my father took me to see a\nUte scalp-dance,--without the scalps, of course,--and--well, first\nimpressions are apt to be lasting. I never see a ball-room in action\nwithout thinking of Fire-in-the-Snow and his capering braves.\"\n\nJeffard smiled at the conceit, but he spoke to the truism.\n\n\"I hope your first impressions of me won't be lasting,\" he ventured. \"I\nthink I was more than usually churlish last night.\"\n\nShe glanced up quickly. \"There should be no 'last night' for us,\" she\naverred.\n\n\"Forgive me; you are quite right. But no matter what happens there\nalways will be.\"\n\nHer gaze lost itself among the circling figures beyond the archway, and\nthe truth of the assertion drove itself home with a twinge of something\nlike regret. But when she turned to him again there was unashamed\nfrankness in the clear gray eyes.\n\n\"What poor minions the conventions have made us,\" she said. \"Let us be\nprimitive and admit that our acquaintance began last night. Does that\nhelp you?\"\n\n\"It will help me very much, if you will let me try to efface the first\nimpression.\"\n\n\"Does it need effacing?\"\n\n\"I think it must. I was moody and half desperate.\"\n\nHe stopped, and she knew that he was waiting for some sign of\nencouragement. She looked away again, meaning not to give it. It is one\nof the little martyrdoms of sympathetic souls to invite confidences and\nthereby to suffer vicariously for the misdoings of the erring majority,\nand her burdens in this wise were many and heavy. Why should she go out\nof her way to add to them those of this man who ought to be abundantly\nable to carry his own? Thus the unspoken question, and the answer came\nclose upon the heels of it. But for her own curiosity,--impertinence,\nshe had begun to call it,--the occasion would never have arisen.\n\n\"I am listening,\" she said, giving him his sign.\n\nBeing permitted to speak freely, Jeffard found himself suddenly\ntongue-tied. \"I don't know what I ought to say,--if, indeed, I ought to\nsay anything at all,\" he began. \"I think I gave you to understand that\nthe world had been using me rather hardly.\"\n\n\"And if you did?\"\n\nA palpitant couple, free of the waltz, came up the stair, and Jeffard\nrose to make way. When the breathless ones perched themselves on the\nlanding above, he went on, standing on the step below her and leaning\nagainst the baluster.\n\n\"If I did, it was an implied untruth. It's a trite saying that the\nworld is what we make it, and I am quite sure now that I have been\nmaking my part of it since I came to Denver. I'm not going to afflict\nyou with the formula, but I shall feel better for having told you that\nI have torn it up and thrown it away.\"\n\n\"And you will write out another?\"\n\n\"Beginning with to-morrow. I leave Denver in the morning.\"\n\n\"You are not going back?\" She said it with a little tang of deprecation\nin the words.\n\nHis heart warmed to the small flash of friendly interest, and he\nsmiled and shook his head. \"No, that would never do--without the\nfortune, you know. I'm going to the mountains; with pick and shovel,\nif need be. I should have started to-night if I hadn't found Mrs.\nCalmaine's invitation. She has been very good to me in a social way,\nand I could do no less than come.\" He said it apologetically, as if the\ndip into the social pool on the eve of the new setting forth demanded\nan explanation.\n\nShe smiled up at him. \"Does it need an apology? Are you sorry you came?\"\n\n\"Sorry? It's the one wise thing I've done these four months. I shall\nalways be glad--and thankful.\" It was on his tongue to say more; to\ndig the pit of confession still deeper, as one who, finding himself\nat the shrine of compassionate purity, would be assoilzied for all\nthe wrong-doings and follies and stumblings of a misguided past; to\nsay many things for which he had no shadow of warrant, and to which\nthe self-contained young woman on the step before him could make no\npossible rejoinder; but the upcoming of the man whose name stood next\non Connie's card saved him. A moment later he was taking his leave.\n\n\"Not going to break away now, are you, Jeffard?\" said the fortunate\none, helping Connie to rise.\n\n\"Yes; I must cut it short. I leave town in the morning. Miss Elliott,\nwill you bid me Godspeed?\"\n\nShe put her hand in his and said what was meet; and to the man who\nstood beside her the parting appeared to be neither more nor less than\nconventionally formal. But when Jeffard was free of the house and\nswinging along on his way cityward, the spirit of it made itself a name\nto live; and out of the God-speed and the kindly phrase of leavetaking\nthe new-blown fire of good intention distilled a subtle liqueur of\njubilance which sang in his veins like the true wine of rejuvenescence;\nso nearly may the alchemy of pure womanhood transmute sounding brass,\nor still baser metal, into the semblance of virgin gold.\n\nSo Jeffard went his way reflective, and while he mused the fire burned\nand he saw himself in his recent stumblings in the valley of dry bones\nas a thing apart. From the saner point of view it seemed incredible\nthat he could ever have been the thrall of such an ignoble passion\nas that which had so lately despoiled him and sent him to tramp the\nstreets like a hungry vagrant. As yet the lesson was but a few hours\nold, but the barrier it had thrown up between the insensate yesterday\nand the rational to-day seemed safely impassable. In the strength of\nreinstated reason, confidence returned; and close upon the heels of\nconfidence, temerity. His reverie had led him past the corner where\nhe should have turned westward, and when he took cognizance of his\nsurroundings he was standing opposite the alley-way of the glass-eyed\ndoors. He glanced at his watch. It was midnight. Twenty-four hours\nbefore, almost to the minute, he had been dragged irresistibly across\nthe street and up the carpeted stair to the lair of the dementia-demon.\n\nHe looked up at the carefully shaded windows, and a sudden desire to\nprove himself came upon him. Not once since the first hot flashes of\nthe fever had begun to quicken his pulse, had he been able to go and\nlook on and return scathless. But was he not sane now? and was not the\nbarrier well builded? If it were not--if it stood only upon the lack of\nopportunity--\n\nHe crossed the street and threaded the narrow alley, tramping steadily\nas one who goes into battle,--a battle which may be postponed, but\nwhich may by no means be evaded. The swing doors gave back under his\nhand, and a minute later he stood beside the table with the inlaid\ncards in its centre, his hands thrust deep in his pockets, and his\nbreath coming in sharp little gasps.\n\nIt was a perilous moment for any son of Adam who has been once bitten\nby the dog of avarice gone mad. The run of luck was against the bank,\nand the piles of counters under the hands of the haggard ones girdling\nthe table grew and multiplied with every turn of the cards. Jeffard's\nlips began to twitch, and the pupils of his eyes narrowed to two\nscintillant points. Slowly, and by almost imperceptible advances, his\nright hand crept from its covert, the fingers tightly clenched upon\nthe small roll of bank-notes,--the Providential windfall which must\nprovision any future argosy of endeavor.\n\nThe dealer ran the cards with monotonous precision, his hands moving\nlike the pieces of a nicely adjusted mechanism. Jeffard's fingers\nunclosed and he stood staring down at the money in his palm as if the\nsight of it fascinated him. Then he turned quickly and tossed it across\nto the banker. \"Reds and whites,\" he said; and the sound of his own\nvoice jarred upon his nerves like the rasping of files in a saw-pit.\n\nTwo hours later, he was again standing on the narrow footway in the\nalley, with the swing doors winging to rest behind him. Two hours of\nfrenzied excitement in the dubious battle with chance, and the day of\npenitence and its hopeful promise for the future were as if they had\nnot been. Halfway across the street he turned and flung his clenched\nfist up at the shaded windows, but his tongue clave to his teeth and\nthe curse turned to a groan with a sob at the end of it. And as he went\nhis way, sodden with weariness, the words of a long-forgotten allegory\nwere ringing knell-like in his ears:--\n\n\"When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh in dry places\nseeking rest, and findeth none. Then he saith, I will return into my\nhouse from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty\nand swept and garnished. Then goeth he and taketh with him seven other\nspirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there;\nand the last state of that man is worse than the first.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nIT was on the day following the dancing party at the Calmaines' that\nConstance Elliott arrayed herself in a modest street dress, and ran\ndown to the library where Miss Van Vetter was writing letters.\n\n\"You'd better change your mind, Myra, and come along with me. It'll do\nyou good to see how the other half lives,\" she said coaxingly.\n\nMiss Van Vetter calmly finished her sentence before she replied.\n\n\"Thank you, Connie; but I believe not. I know it is the proper fad\nnowadays to go slumming, but I can't do it; it's a matter of principle\nwith me.\"\n\nConnie's eyebrows arched in mild surprise. \"That's a new one,\" she\ncommented. \"I've heard all kinds of excuses, but never that. How do you\ndiagram it?\"\n\n\"It is simple enough. One sees plenty of misery in the ordinary course\nof things without making a specialty of looking for it; and when you've\ndone everything that your money and sympathy can do, it is only a\nsingle drop in the great ocean of human wretchedness, after all. More\nthan that, you have added to the sum total of the world's suffering\nby just so much as the miseries of the others hurt you through your\ncompassion.\"\n\n\"Myra, dear, if I didn't know that you are better than your theories, I\nshould try to humble you. What will you do if the evil day ever comes\nto you?\"\n\n\"Unload my woes upon some such angelic and charitable sister of mercy\nas you are, I suppose,\" rejoined Miss Van Vetter complacently. \"But\nthat doesn't make it necessary for me to go about and shed literal\ntears with those who weep, now. I prefer to do it by proxy.\" She took\na gold piece from her purse and offered it to Constance. \"Take this,\nand make some poor wretch comfortable for ten or fifteen minutes on my\naccount.\"\n\nMiss Elliott was not yet canonized, and she refused the contribution\nwith an indignant little stamp of her foot. \"Myra Van Vetter, you're\nworse than a heathen! I wouldn't touch your money with the tip of\nmy finger; I'd be afraid it would burn me. I hope you'll learn for\nyourself some day what the cold shoulder of charity is--there!\" And she\nswept out of the room with as much dignity as five-feet-one-and-a-half\nmay compass upon extraordinary occasions.\n\nOnce on the other side of the library door, she laughed softly to\nherself and was instantly Connie the serene again.\n\n\"It does me a whole lot of good to boil over once in a while,\" she\nsaid, going out on the veranda. \"Myra serves one beneficent end in the\ncosmogony in spite of herself: she's a perfect safety-valve for me.\nTommie-e-e-e! O Tom! Are you out there?\"\n\nA ragged boy, sitting on the curb and shaking dice with a pair of\npebbles, sprang up and ran to the gate. When the latch baffled him, as\nit usually did from the outside, he vaulted the fence and stood before\nher.\n\n\"Prompt as usual, aren't you, Tommie?\"\n\n\"Ain't got nothin' else to do but to be promp'. Is it a baskit, dis\ntime, 'r wot?\"\n\n\"It's a basket, and you'll find it in the kitchen.\"\n\nFive minutes later the dwellers in the avenue might have seen a small\nprocession headed townwards. Its component parts were a dainty little\nlady, walking very straight with her hands in the pockets of her\njacket, and a ragged urchin bent sidewise against the weight of a\ncapacious basket.\n\nThe street-car line was convenient, but Constance walked in deference\nto Tommie's convictions,--he objected to the car on the score of\neconomy. \"Wot's the use o' givin' a bloated corp'ration a nickel w'en\na feller can mog along on his feets?\" he had demanded, one day; and\nthereafter they walked.\n\nWhat profits it to set down in measured phrase at what numbers in\nwhat streets the basket cover was lifted that afternoon? Doubtless,\nin that great day when the books shall be opened, it will be found\nthat a faithful record has been kept, not only of the tumbler of jelly\nleft with bedridden Mother M'Garrihan, the bottle of wine put into the\nhands of gaunt Tom Devins, who was slowly dying of lead-poisoning, and\nthe more substantial viands spread out before the hungry children in\ndrunken Owen David's shanty, but of all the other deeds of mercy that\nleft a trail of thankful benisons in the wake of the small procession.\nBe it sufficient to say that the round was a long one, and that\nConstance spared neither herself nor her father's bank-account where\nshe found misery with uplifted hands.\n\nThe basket had grown appreciably lighter, and Tommie's body was once\nmore approaching the perpendicular, when the procession paused before\nan unswept stairway leading to the second story of a building fronting\non one of the lower cross streets. Constance held out her hand for the\nbasket, but the boy put it behind him.\n\n\"Wot's the matter with me?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Nothing at all, Tommie. I only meant to save you a climb. The basket\nisn't heavy now, you know.\"\n\n\"S'posin' it ain't; ain't I hired to run this end o' the show? You jes'\ntell me where you want it put, an' that's right where I'm goin' to put\nit, an' not nowheres else.\"\n\nShe smiled and let him lead the way up the dusty stair. At a certain\ndoor near the end of the long upper corridor she signed to him to give\nher the basket. \"Go to the head of the stairs and wait,\" she whispered.\n\"I may want you.\"\n\nWhen he was out of hearing she tapped on the door and went in. It was\nthe interior of all others that made Constance want to cry. There was a\nsufficiency of garish furniture and tawdry knickknacks scattered about\nto show that it was not the dwelling-place of the desperately poor; but\nthese were only the accessories to the picture of desolation and utter\nneglect having for its central figure the woman stretched out upon the\nbed. She was asleep, and her face was turned toward the light which\nstruggled feebly through the unwashed window. Beauty there had been,\nand might be again, but not even the flush of health would efface the\nmarks of Margaret Gannon's latest plunge into the chilling depths of\nhuman indifference. Connie tiptoed to the bedside and looked, and her\nheart swelled within her.\n\nIt had fallen out in this wise. On the Monday night Mademoiselle\nAngeline--known to her intimates as Mag Gannon--saw fuzzy little\ncircles expand and contract around the gas-jets in the Bijou Theatre\nwhile she was walking through her part in the farce. Tuesday night the\nfuzzy circles became blurs; and the stage manager swore audibly when\nshe faltered and missed the step in her specialty. On the Wednesday\nMademoiselle Angeline disappeared from the Bijou altogether; and for\nthree days she had lain helpless and suffering, seeing no human face\nuntil Constance came and ministered to her. And the pity of it was that\nwhile the fever wrought its torturous will upon her, delirium would not\ncome to help her to forget that she was forgotten.\n\nConstance had pieced out the pitiful story by fragments while she was\ndragging the woman back from the brink of the pit; and when all was\nsaid, she began to understand that a sick soul demands other remedies\nthan drugs and dainties. Just what they were, or how they were to be\napplied, was another matter; but Constance grappled with the problem as\nardently as if no one had ever before attacked it. In her later visits\nshe always brought the conversation around to Margaret's future; and on\nthe afternoon of the basket-procession, after she had made her patient\neat and drink, she essayed once again to enlist the woman's will in her\nown behalf.\n\n\"It's no use of me trying, Miss Constance; I've got to go back when I'm\nfit. There ain't nothing else for the likes of me to do.\"\n\n\"How can you tell till you try? O Margaret, I wish you would try!\"\n\nA smile of hard-earned wisdom flitted across the face of the woman.\n\"You know more than most of 'em,\" she said, \"but you don't know it all.\nYou can't, you see; you're so good the world puts on its gloves before\nit touches you. But for the likes of me, we get the bare hand, and\nwe're playing in luck if it ain't made into a fist.\"\n\n\"You poor girl! It makes my heart ache to think what you must have gone\nthrough before you could learn to say a thing like that. But you must\ntry; I can't let you go back to that awful place after what you've told\nme about it.\"\n\n\"Supposing I did try; there's only the one thing on earth I know how to\ndo,--that's trim hats. Suppose you run your pretty feet off till you\nfound me a place where I could work right. How long would it be before\nsomebody would go to the missis, or the boss, or whoever it might be,\nand say, 'See here; you've got one of Pete Grim's Bijou women in there.\nThat won't do.' And the night after, I'd be doing my specialty again,\nif I was that lucky to get on.\"\n\n\"But you could learn to do housework, or something of that kind, so you\ncould keep out of the way of people who would remember you. You must\nhave had some experience.\"\n\nThe invalid rocked her head on the pillow. \"That'd be worse than the\nother. Somebody'd be dead sure to find out and tell; and then I'd be\nlucky if I got off without going to jail. And for the experience,--a\nminute ago you called me a girl, but I know you didn't mean it. How old\ndo you think I am?\"\n\nConstance looked at the fever-burned face, and tried to make allowances\nfor the ravages of disease. \"I should say twenty-five,\" she replied,\n\"only you talk as if you might be older.\"\n\n\"I'll be eighteen next June, if I'd happen to live that long,\" said\nMargaret; and Constance went home a few minutes later with a new pain\nin her heart, born of the simple statement.\n\nAt the gate she took the empty basket and paid the boy. \"That's all\nfor to-day, but I want to give you some more work,\" she said. \"Every\nmorning, and every noon, and every night, until I tell you to stop, I\nwant you to go up to that last place and ask Margaret Gannon if there\nis anything you can do for her. And if she says yes, you do it; and if\nit's too big for you to do, you come right up here after me. Will you\ndo all that?\"\n\n\"Will I? Will a yaller dorg eat his supper w'en he's hungry? You're\njes' dead right I'll do it. An' I'll be yere to-morrer afternoon,\npromp'.\"\n\nAll of which was well enough in its way, but the problem was yet\nunsolved, and Constance had to draw heavily on her reserves of\ncheerfulness to be able to make an accordant one of four when Richard\nBartrow called that evening after dinner.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nDURING the week following the day of repentance and backsliding,\nJeffard's regression down the inclined plane became an accelerated\nrush. In that interval he parted with his watch and his surveying\ninstruments, and made a beginning on his surplus clothing. It was a\nmeasure of the velocity of the descent that the watch, with the transit\nand level, brought him no more than seven knife-and-fork meals and an\noccasional luncheon. But the clothing being transmutable in smaller\ninstallments, did rather better.\n\nBefore the week was out, a bachelor's apartment in a respectable\nlocality became an incongruous superfluity; and having by no means\nreached the philosophical level in his descent, he hid himself from all\ncomers in a dubious neighborhood below Larimer Street.\n\nThe second week brought sharper misery than the first, since it\nenforced the pitiful shifts of vagrancy before he could acquire the\nspirit-breaking experience which makes them tolerable. But before many\ndays the poor remnants of pride and self-respect gave up the unequal\nstruggle, leaving him to his own devices; after which he soon learned\nhow to keep an open and unbalanced meal-and-cigar account with his few\nunmercenary friends.\n\nIn a short time, however, the friendly tables began to grow scarce.\nBartrow went back to his mine, and with his going the doors of the St.\nJames's dining-room opened no more to the proletary. Then came the\nreturn of John Pettigrew, whose hospitality was as boundless as the\nrange whereon his herds grazed, and who claimed kinship with Jeffard\nbecause both chanced to be transplanted New Englanders. While Pettigrew\nstayed in Denver, Jeffard lived on the fat of the land, eating at his\nfriend's table at the Albany, and gambling with the ranchman's money\nat odd hours of the day and night. But after Pettigrew left there was\nanother lean interval, and Jeffard grew haggard and ran his weight down\nat the rate of a pound a day.\n\nIn the midst of this came a spasm of the reformative sort, born of a\npassing glimpse of Stephen Elliott's daughter on one of her charitable\nexpeditions. The incident brought him face to face with a fact which\nhad been unconsciously lending desperation to despair. Now that the\ndiscovery could be no more than an added twist of the thumbscrew, he\nbegan to realize that he had found in the person of the sweet-faced\nyoung woman with the far-seeing eyes the Heaven-born alchemist who\ncould, if she so willed, transmute the flinty perverseness of him\ninto plastic wax, shaping it after her own ideals; that it was the\nunacknowledged beginning of love which had found wings for the\nshort-lived flight of higher hopes and more worthy aspirations. The\nday of fasting and penitence had set his feet in the way leading to\nreinstatement in his own good opinion; but the meeting with Constance\nwas answerable for a worthier prompting,--a perfervid determination to\nfight his way back to better things for righteousness' sake, knowing\nthat no otherwise could he hope to stand with her on the Mount of\nBenediction.\n\nIt was against this anointing of grace that he had sinned; and it\nwas in remorseful memory of it that he brushed his clothes, put on\nan ill-fitting air of respectability, and tramped the streets in a\nfruitless search for employment until he was ready to drop from fatigue\nand hunger. Nothing came of it. The great public, and notably the\nemploying minority of it, is no mean physiognomist; and the gambler\ncarries his hall-mark no less than the profligate or the drunkard.\n\nAt the close of one of these days of disheartenment, a day wherein a\nsingle cup of coffee had been made to stand sponsor for breakfast,\nluncheon, and dinner, Jeffard saw a familiar figure standing at the\ncounter in one of the newspaper offices. Knowing his man, Jeffard\nstopped on the sidewalk and waited. If Lansdale had but the price of a\nsingle meal in his pocket, two men would share that meal that night.\n\nThere were two entrances to the newspaper office, and Jeffard watched\nbeaglewise lest his chance of breaking his fast should vanish while he\ntarried. Presently Lansdale came out, and Jeffard fell upon him before\nhe could latch the door.\n\n\"Salaam! Jeffard, my son,\" said the outcomer. \"I saw you waiting for\nme. How goes the world-old struggle for existence?\"\n\n\"Don't remind me of it, Lansdale; do you happen to have the price of a\nmeal about you?\"\n\nLansdale smiled, and gravely tucking Jeffard's arm under his own,\nsteered diagonally across the street toward the open doors of a caf\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n\"Now that is what our forefathers called Providence, and what we, being\nso much wiser in our own generation, call luck,\" he declared. \"I had\njust got a check out of the post-office for a bit of work sent months\nago to an editor whose name is unhasting. When you saw me I was closing\na negotiation, by the terms of which the cashier of the 'Coloradoan'\nbecomes my banker. Behold, now, the mysteries of--shall we say\nProvidence? At any time within the six months I would have sworn that\nthe opportune moment for the arrival of this bit of money-paper had\ncome; nevertheless Providence, and the slow-geared editor, get it here\njust in time to save two men from going to bed supperless. Why don't\nyou say something?\"\n\nThey were at the door of the caf\u00c3\u00a9, and Jeffard gripped his companion's\narm and thrust him in. \"Can't you see that I'm too damned hungry to\ntalk?\" he demanded savagely; and Lansdale wisely held his peace until\nthe barbarian in his guest had been appeased.\n\nWhen the soup and fish had disappeared, Jeffard was ashamed of himself,\nand said as much.\n\n\"You mustn't mind what I said,\" he began, by way of making amends.\n\"I used to think I was a civilized being, but, God help me, Lansdale,\nI'm not! When I've gone without food for twenty-four hours on end, I'm\nnothing more or less than a hungry savage.\"\n\nLansdale smiled intelligence. \"I know the taste of it, and it's bad\nmedicine--for the soul as well as for the body,\" he rejoined. \"There is\nreason to suspect that Shakespeare never went hungry, else he wouldn't\nhave said, 'Sweet are the uses of adversity.' They're not sweet;\nthey're damnably bitter. A man may come forth of the winepress with\nbones unbroken and insight sharpened to the puncturing point; but his\ncapacity for evil will be increased in just proportion.\"\n\n\"I don't want to believe that,\" said Jeffard, whose despair was not yet\nproof against a good meal in good company.\n\n\"You needn't, but it's true. The necessities breed a certain\nfamiliarity with evil. Moral metes and bounds have a trick of\ndisappearing in the day of physical dearth. When hunger has driven a\nman over the ethical boundary a few times, the crossing becomes easy;\nand when hunger drops the whip, inclination is very likely to take it\nup.\"\n\nJeffard laughed. \"'The words of Agur the son of Jakeh,'\" he quoted. \"I\nbelieve you'd moralize if you were going to be hanged, Lansdale.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I should. What possible contingency could offer better\nopportunities? And am I not going to be hanged--or choked, which\namounts to the same thing?\"\n\nJeffard looked up quickly and saw what the myopia of hunger had\nhitherto obscured: that his companion's smooth-shaven face seemed\ngaunter than usual, and that his hands were unsteady when he lifted the\nknife and fork.\n\n\"Colorado isn't helping you, then,\" he said.\n\n\"No; but it isn't altogether Colorado's fault. The Boston medicine man\nsaid change of climate, plenty of outdoor indolence, nutritious food\nat stated intervals. I have all any one could ask of the first, and as\nlittle of either of the others as may be.\"\n\n\"But you do good work, Lansdale. I've always believed you could make it\nwin, in time. Hasn't the time come yet?\"\n\n\"No. What I can do easiest would bring bread and meat, if I could sell\nit; but a literary hack-writer has no business in Colorado--or anywhere\nelse outside of the literary centres. In Boston I could always find an\nodd job of reviewing, or space-writing, or something that would serve\nto keep body and soul together; but here they won't have me even in the\nnewspapers.\"\n\n\"Overcrowded, I suppose, like everything else in this cursed country.\"\n\n\"That's the alleged reason; but the fact is that I'm not a journalist.\nYour thoroughbred newspaper man has more or less contempt for a fellow\nwho can't or won't write journalese.\"\n\nThey had attained to the dessert, and the waiter was opening a modest\nbottle of claret for them. Jeffard turned his wineglass down.\n\n\"What! Is that the way you flout a man's hospitality?\" demanded\nLansdale, in mock displeasure.\n\n\"No; I don't mean to do that. But I'm drunken with feasting now, and if\nI put wine into me I shall pawn the coat off my back before midnight\nfor a stake to play with.\"\n\nLansdale smiled. \"I'll see that you don't have to. Turn up your glass.\"\n\nBut Jeffard was obstinate, and sat munching raisins while Lansdale\nsipped his wine. When the waiter brought the cigars he came out of his\nreverie to say, \"You want to live, don't you, Lansdale?\"\n\nThe potential man of letters took time to think about it. \"I suppose\nI do; else I shouldn't be starving to death in Denver,\" he admitted\nfinally.\n\n\"And there is nothing but the lack of a little ready money that keeps\nyou from giving the Boston doctor's prescription a fair trial. If I had\nthe money I believe I'd change places with you; that is, I'd give you\nthe money in exchange for your good chance of being able to shuffle off\nmortality without the help of extraneous means. I think I've had enough\nof it.\"\n\n\"Do you? That proves how little a man has learned when he thinks he has\narrived. Now pull yourself together, and tell me what you really would\ndo if you became suddenly rich.\"\n\n\"How rich?\"\n\n\"Oh, make it a comfortable figure; say eight or ten thousand a month\nfor an income.\"\n\n\"I'd do what I said I should,--change places with you; only I suppose\nthat wouldn't be possible. Failing that\"--He pondered over it for a\nmoment, balancing his fork on the edge of his plate the while. \"A few\nweeks ago I should have mapped out a future worth talking about. I had\na lucid day, in which the things that make for ambition of the better\nsort had their inning. If you had asked me such a question then, I\nshould doubtless have told you that I should try to realize the ideals\nof other days; to walk uprightly, and to hold great wealth as it should\nbe held--in trust for the good of one's kind; to win the love of the\nideal woman, perhaps; and, having won it, to sit at her feet until I\nhad learned how to be God's almoner.\"\n\nLansdale's smile was not wholly cynical. \"But now?\" he queried.\n\n\"But now I know my own limitations. I think I should go back to the old\nfarm in the Berkshire Hills, and try to make it earn me bread and meat.\"\n\n\"But you couldn't spend ten thousand a month on an abandoned farm,\nthough I grant you it would be a pretty expensive luxury. What would\nyou do with the lave of it?\"\n\nJeffard's lips tightened, and his face was not pleasant to look upon.\n\"I'd let it go on accumulating, piling up and up till there was no\nshadow of possibility that I should ever again come to know what it\nmeans to be without money. And even then I should know I could never\nget enough,\" he added.\n\nThis time Lansdale's smile was of incredulity. \"Let me prophesy,\" he\nsuggested. \"When your lucky day overtakes you, you will do none of\nthese things. Jeffard the fool may be heard of wherever the Associated\nPress has a wire or a correspondent; but Jeffard the miser will never\nexist outside of your own unbalanced imagination. Let's go out and\nwalk. It's fervidly close in here.\"\n\nArm in arm they paced the streets until nearly midnight, talking of\nthings practical and impracticable, and keeping well out of the present\nin either the past or the future. When Lansdale said good-night, he\nstuffed a bank-note into Jeffard's pocket.\n\n\"It's only a loan,\" he protested, when Jeffard would have made him take\nit back. \"And there are no conditions. You can go and play with it, if\nthat's what you'd rather do.\"\n\nThe suggestion was unfortunate, though possibly the result would have\nbeen the same in any event. Five minutes after parting from Lansdale,\nJeffard had taken his place in the silent group around the table in the\nupper room; and by the time the pile of counters under his hand had\nincreased to double the amount of Lansdale's gift, he was oblivious to\neverything save the one potent fact--that after so many reverses his\nluck had turned at last.\n\nFive hundred and odd dollars he had at one time in that eventful\nsitting, and his neighbor across the corner of the table, a grizzled\nminer with the jaw of a pugilist and eyes that had a trick of softening\nlike a woman's, had warned him by winks, nods, and sundry kicks under\nthe table to stop. Jeffard scowled his resentment of the interference\nand played on, losing steadily until his capital had shrunk to fifty\ndollars. Then the miner rose up in his place, reached across, and gave\nJeffard an open-handed buffet that nearly knocked him out of his chair.\n\n\"Dad blame you!\" he roared; \"I'll learn you how to spile my play! Stan'\nup and fight it out like a man!\"\n\nThe game stopped at once. The dealer held his hand, and the banker\nreached for his revolver.\n\n\"You two gen'lemen cash in and get out o' here,\" he commanded. \"This is\na gen'leman's game, and we don't run no shootin'-gallery--leastwise,\nnot unless _I_ have to take a hand in it. Pass in your chips.\"\n\nThey both obeyed; the miner with maledictory reluctance, and Jeffard\nin a tremulous frenzy of wrath. When they reached the sidewalk,\nJeffard flung himself savagely upon his assailant, only to learn that\nabstinence is a poor trainer, and that he was little better than a\nlay-figure in the grasp of the square-jawed one with the melting eyes.\nThe big man thrust him into a corner and held him there until he\nlistened to reason.\n\n\"You blamed idjit! you hain't got sense enough to go in when it rains!\nHold still, 'r I'll bump your head ag'inst the wall! As I was sayin',\nyou don't know enough to pound sand. Every single time I've been in\nthis dive, you've been here, too, a-blowin' yourself like you had a\nwad as big as a feather bed, and you know danged well you hain't got\nnothin'. And you wouldn't 'a' kep' a dern cent to-night, if I hadn't\nthumped you and raised a row. Now you go and hunt you a place to sleep\nwhile you've got dust enough to pay for it; and don't you come round\nhere ag'in till you've put a whole grub-stake inside of you. Savez?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nFROM the beginning of the cannibalistic stage of the journey down\nthe inclined plane, Jeffard had determined that, come what might, he\nwould keep enough of his wardrobe to enable him to present an outward\nappearance of respectability. With a vague premonition of the not\nimprobable end of the journey he recoiled at the thought of figuring\nbefore a coroner's jury as a common vagrant.\n\nThis resolution, however, like all others of a prideful nature, went\ndown before the renewed assaults of the allies, hunger and dementia.\nWhereby it speedily came to pass that he retained only the garments he\nstood in, and these soon became shabby and wayworn. Since, in his own\nestimation, if not in that of others, the clothes do make the man to a\nvery considerable extent, Jeffard gradually withdrew from his former\nlounging-places, confining himself to the less critical region below\nLarimer Street during the day, and avoiding as much as possible the\nhaunts of his former associates at all hours.\n\nIt was for this cause that Bartrow, on his return from Chaffee County,\nwas unable to find Jeffard. Meeting Lansdale when the search had become\nunhopeful, the large-hearted man of the altitudes lamented his failure\nafter his own peculiar fashion.\n\n\"When was it you saw him last?\" he inquired of the transplanted\nBostonian.\n\n\"It was about a week ago. To be exact, it was a week Tuesday. I\nremember because we dined together that evening.\"\n\n\"Now doesn't that beat the band? Here I've gone and got him a soft snap\nup on the range--good pay, and little or nothing to do--and he's got to\ngo and drop out like a monte man's little joker. It's enough to make a\nman swear continuous!\"\n\n\"I don't think he would have gone with you,\" Lansdale ventured.\n\n\"Wouldn't, eh? If I can find him I'll take him by the neck and make him\ngo; savez? How do you put it up? Runaway? or a pile of bones out on the\nprairie somewhere?\"\n\n\"It's hard to say. Jeffard's a queer combination of good and not so\ngood,--like a few others of us,--and just now the negative part is\non top. He was pretty low the night we were together, though when we\nseparated I thought he was taking himself a little less seriously.\"\n\n\"Didn't talk about getting the drop on himself, or anything like that?\"\n\n\"N--no, not in a way to leave the impression that he was in any\nimmediate danger of doing such a thing.\"\n\nBartrow chewed the end of his cigar reflectively. \"Hasn't taken to\nquizzing the world through the bottom of a whiskey-glass?\"\n\n\"No, I should say not. Thus far, I think he has but the one devil.\"\n\n\"And that's the 'tiger,' of course. I knew about that; I've known it\nall along. The Lord forgive me! I don't know but I was the ring-master\nin that show. You know we chased around a good deal together, along at\nthe first, and it's as likely as not I showed him a whole lot of things\nhe'd better not have seen.\"\n\nThe half-cynical smile lightened upon Lansdale's grave face. \"That is\none of my criticisms of Western manners,\" he commented. \"When you get\nhold of a stranger, you welcome him with open arms--and proceed to\nregale him with a near-hand view of the back yards and cesspools. And\nthen you swear piteously when he goes back East and tells his friends\nwhat an abandoned lot you are.\"\n\nBartrow took the thrust good-naturedly, as he did most of his\nchastenings. \"That's right; that's just about what we do. But you've\nbeen here long enough now to know that it's meant for hospitality. It's\na way we've got into of taking it for granted that people come out here\nmore to see the sights than for any other purpose.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's good of you--I don't deny that; only it's a little rough on\nthe new-comer, sometimes. Take Jeffard's case, for example. He came to\nDenver with good introductions; I know, for I saw some of them. But\na man in a strange city doesn't often go about presenting his social\ncredentials. What he does is to make a few haphazard acquaintances,\nand let them set the pace for him. That is what Jeffard did, and I'll\nventure to say there have been nine evil doors open to him to one good\none. You've known him longer than any one else--how many times have\nyou invited him to spend a rational evening with you in the company of\nrespectable people?\"\n\n\"Good Lord, Lansdale; for Heaven's sake don't begin to open up that\nlead! We're all miserable sinners, and I'm the medicine-man of the\ntribe. I never asked the poor devil to go visiting with me but once,\nand that was after he was down.\"\n\n\"And then he wouldn't go, as a matter of course. But that is neither\nhere nor there. I'll find him for you, if I can, and leave word for you\nat the St. James.\"\n\n\"You're a brick, Lansdale; that's about what you are. I'll get square\nwith you some day. By the way, can't you come up to Steve Elliott's\nwith me this evening and meet some good people?\"\n\nLansdale laughed outright. \"You're a good fellow, Bartrow, but you're\nno diplomat. When I go a-fishing into your mentality you'll never see\nthe hook. Make my apologies to your friends, and tell them I'm an\ninvalid.\"\n\nAnd Bartrow, being densely practical, and so proof against irony of\nwhatsoever calibre, actually did so that evening when he called upon\nMiss Elliott and her cousin.\n\n\"But your friend wasn't promised to us, Mr. Bartrow,\" objected Miss Van\nVetter. \"Why should he send excuses?\"\n\n\"I'm blessed if I know,\" said honest Dick, looking innocently from one\nto the other of them. \"But that's what he told me to do, and I've done\nit.\"\n\nConstance laughed softly. \"You're too good for any use, Dick. He was\nmaking game of you. Tell us how he came to say it.\"\n\nBartrow did that, also; and the two young women laughed in chorus.\n\n\"After you've had your fun out of it I wish you'd tell me, so I can\nlaugh too,\" he said. \"I can't see where the joke comes in, myself.\"\n\nConstance enlightened him. \"There isn't any joke--only this: he had\njust been scolding you about your inhospitality, and then you turn on\nhim and ask him to go calling with you. Of course, he couldn't accept,\nthen; it would have been like inviting himself.\"\n\n\"Well, what of it? I don't see why he shouldn't invite himself, if he\nfelt like it. He's a rattling good fellow.\" And from thence the talk\ndrifted easily to Jeffard, who was, or who had been, another good\nfellow.\n\nAt the mention of Jeffard's name, Constance borrowed the mask of\ndisinterest, and laid her commands on Bartrow. \"Tell us about him,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"There isn't much to tell. He came here from somewhere back East, got\ninto bad company, lost his money, and now he's disappeared.\"\n\n\"How did he lose his money?\" Constance would have asked the question,\nbut her cousin forestalled her.\n\n\"Gambled it,\" quoth Bartrow placidly.\n\nConstance looked sorry, and Miss Van Vetter was plainly shocked. \"How\nvery dreadful!\" said the latter. \"Did he lose much?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; you couldn't call it much--only a few thousands, I believe.\nBut then, you see, it was his stake; it was all he had, and he couldn't\nafford to give it up. And now he has gone and hid out somewhere just\nwhen I have found a place for him. It makes me very weary.\"\n\n\"Can't you find any trace of him?\" queried Constance. \"That is\nsingular. I should think he would have left his address.\"\n\nBartrow grinned. \"Well, hardly. Man don't leave his address when he\nwants to drop out. That's the one thing he's pretty sure to take with\nhim. But we'll run him down yet, if he's on top of earth. Lansdale has\nseen more of him lately than I have, and he is taking a hand. He and\nJeffard used to flock together a good deal when the shoe was on the\nother foot.\"\n\nMiss Van Vetter looked mystified; and Bartrow deemed it a matter for\nself-congratulation that he was able to comprehend the query in her\neyes without having it hurled at him in so many words.\n\n\"That was while Jeffard had money, and Lansdale was trying to starve\nhimself to death,\" he explained. \"You see, Lansdale is a queer fish\nin some ways. When he's down he won't let anybody touch him on his\nmoney side, so we used to work all kinds of schemes to keep him going.\nJeffard would study them up, and I'd help him steer them.\"\n\nThis was practical benevolence, and Connie's interest bestirred itself\nin its charitable part. \"What were some of the schemes?\" she asked.\n\n\"Oh, there were a lot of them. Lansdale can see farther into a\nmillstone than most people, and we had to invent new ones as we\nwent along. One time, Jeffard bought a common, every-day sort of a\npocketbook, and rumpled it up and tramped on it till it looked as\nif it might have come across the plains in Fifty-nine. Then he put\na twenty-dollar bill and some loose silver in it, and dropped it on\nthe sidewalk where I was walking Lansdale up and down for his health.\nAfter a while, when he'd actually stumbled over it four or five times,\nLansdale saw the wallet and picked it up. Right there the scheme nearly\nfell down. You see, he was going to make me take charge of it while he\nadvertised it. I got out of it, somehow, but I don't believe he used a\nnickel of the money for a month.\"\n\nConnie clapped her hands softly. \"That was fine! Tell us some more.\"\n\n\"The next one was better, and it worked like a charm. Lansdale writes\nthings for the papers, only the editors here wouldn't buy any of his\nwork\"--\n\n\"Why not?\" interrupted Miss Van Vetter.\n\n\"I don't know; because it was too good, I guess. Anyway, they wouldn't\nbuy it, so Jeffard went to work on that lead. I took him around and\nintroduced him to Kershaw of the 'Coloradoan,' and he made Kershaw take\nfifty dollars on deposit, and got him to promise to accept some of\nLansdale's stories. Kershaw kicked like the deu--like the mischief,\nand didn't want to do it; but we bullied him, and then I got Lansdale\nto send him some stuff.\"\n\n\"Mr. Jeffard is an artist in schemes, and I envy him,\" said Connie.\n\"What happened to that one?\"\n\n\"Kershaw upset it by not printing the stuff. Of course, Lansdale\nwatched the 'Coloradoan,' and when he found he wasn't in it, he\nwouldn't send any more. We caught him the next time, though, for\nsomething worth while.\"\n\n\"How was that?\" It was Miss Van Vetter who asked the question; and\nBartrow made a strenuous effort to evade the frontier idiom which stood\nready to trip him at every turn when Myra Van Vetter's poiseful gaze\nrested upon him.\n\n\"Why, I happen to have a played-out--er--that is, a sort of no-account\nmine up in Clear Creek, and I made Lansdale believe I was the resident\nagent for the property, authorized to get up a descriptive prospectus.\nHe took the job of writing it, and never once tumbled to the\nracket--that is, he never suspected that we were working him for a--oh,\ngood Lord, why can't I talk plain English!--you know what I mean; he\nthought it was all straight. Well, he turned in the copy, and we paid\nhim as much as he'd stand; but he has just about worried the life out\nof me ever since, trying to get to read proof on that prospectus.\nThat one was Jeffard's idea, too, but I made him let me in on the\nassessment.\"\n\nBefore Miss Van Vetter could inquire what the \"assessment\" was,\nStephen Elliott came in and the talk became general. An hour later,\nwhen Bartrow took his leave, Constance went to the door with him.\n\n\"Don't you really know where Mr. Jeffard is, Dick?\" she asked.\n\nSomething in her tone set him upon the right track. \"No; do you?\"\n\n\"I know that he left Denver quite a while ago; about the time you were\ndown last.\"\n\n\"How do you know it?\"\n\n\"He told me he was going.\"\n\n\"The mischief he did! Where did you get acquainted with him?\"\n\n\"At Mrs. Calmaine's.\"\n\nHonest Dick ground his heel into the door-mat and thrust his hands deep\ninto the pockets of his overcoat. What was in his mind came out shorn\nof euphemism.\n\n\"Say, Connie, do you care anything about him?\"\n\n\"What a question!\" she retorted, not pretending to misunderstand its\npointing. \"I've met him only once--or twice, I should say, though I\ndidn't even know his name the first time.\"\n\n\"What did he tell you? about his going away, I mean.\"\n\n\"He said--but you've no right to ask me, Dick. It wasn't exactly a\nconfidence, but\"--\n\n\"Yes, I have a right to ask; he was my friend a good while before he\nwas yours. Tell me what he said.\"\n\n\"He gave me to understand that things hadn't been going quite right\nwith him, and he said he was going to the mountains to--to try to make\nanother start.\"\n\nBartrow tucked Connie's arm under his own and walked her up and down\nthe long veranda twice before he could bring himself to say the thing\nthat was.\n\n\"He didn't go, Connie; he's here now, if he hasn't gone out on the\nprairie somewhere and taken a pot shot at himself. Lansdale saw him\nonly a week or so ago.\"\n\n\"Oh, Dick!\"\n\n\"It's tough, isn't it?\" He stood on the step and buttoned his coat.\n\"But I'm glad you know him--or at least, know who he is. If you should\nhappen to run across him in any of your charity trips, just set Tommie\non him and wire me if you find out where he burrows.\"\n\n\"You said you had found a place for him. Will it keep?\"\n\n\"I'll try to hold it open for him, and if you wire, I'll come down and\ntackle him. He's too good a fellow to turn down in his little day of\nwitlessness. Good-night; and good-by--for a week or so. I've got to go\nback on the morning train.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nCONTRARY to the doctor's prophecy, Margaret Gannon's progress\ntoward recovery was slow and rather uncertain. Constance professed\nto be sorry, but in her heart she was thankful, since the hesitant\nconvalescence gave her time to try many expedients pointing toward\nthe moral rehabilitation of her prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9e. Ignoring Margaret's bodeful\nprediction, Constance coursed far and wide, quartering the domestic\nfield diligently; but inasmuch as she was careful in each instance\nto state the exact truth, each endeavor was but the introduction to\nanother failure.\n\n\"Why, Constance Elliott! The idea of your proposing such a thing to\nme!\" said Mrs. Calmaine, upon whose motherly good sense Connie had\nleaned from childhood. \"That is what comes of a girl growing up as\nyou have without a mother to watch over her. Can't you understand how\ndreadful it is for you to mix up in such things? You can't touch pitch\nand not be defiled.\"\n\nConnie was moved, first to tears, and presently to indignation.\n\n\"No, I can't understand anything of the kind,\" she retorted. \"It's your\nprivilege not to take Margaret if you don't want her; but it's mine\nto help her, if I can. And I mean to do it in spite of all the cruel\nprejudice in the world!\"\n\n\"You talk like a foolish child, Connie. I can tell you beforehand that\nyou won't succeed in getting the woman into any respectable household\nin Denver, unless you do it under false pretenses.\"\n\n\"So much the worse for our Christianity, then,\" Connie asserted\nstoutly. \"If people won't help, they'll have it to answer to One who\nwasn't afraid to take a much worse woman by the hand. That's all I have\nto say about it.\"\n\nMrs. Calmaine smiled benignantly. She had daughters of her own, and\nknew how to make allowances for youthful enthusiasm.\n\n\"You will get over it, after a while, and then you'll see how foolish\nit is to try to reform the world single-handed,\" she rejoined. \"You\nmight as well try to move Pike's Peak as to think you can remodel\nsociety after your own enthusiastic notions. And when the reflective\nafter-time comes, you'll be glad that society didn't let you make a\nmartyr of yourself at its expense.\n\n\"And, Connie, dear; there is another side of the question which you\nshould consider,\" she continued, going to the door with her visitor.\n\"It's this: since society as a unit insists upon having this particular\nkind of reformative work turned over to organizations designed for the\npurpose, there must be a sufficient reason for it. You are not wiser\nthan the aggregated wisdom of the civilized centuries.\"\n\nConstance went her way, silenced, but by no means convinced; and\nshe added three more failures to her long list before going home to\nluncheon. In the afternoon, she laid hold of her courage yet once\nagain, and went to her minister, good Dr. Launceston, pastor of St.\nCyril's-in-the-Desert. Here, indeed, she found sympathy without stint,\nbut it was hopelessly void of practical suggestion.\n\n\"It is certainly most pitiful, Miss Elliott, pitiful to a degree; but\nI really don't see what is to be done. Had you any plan in view that,\nah\"--\n\n\"It is because all my plans have come to grief that I am here,\" said\nConnie.\n\n\"Dear, dear! and those cases are so very hard to deal with. Now, if it\nwere a question of money, I dare say we could manage it quite easily.\"\n\nConstance had some very clear ideas on reformative subjects, and one of\nthem was that it was not less culpable to pauperize than to ignore.\n\n\"It isn't that,\" she made haste to say. \"I could get money easily\nenough, but Margaret wouldn't take it. If she would, I should have\nsmall hopes for her.\"\n\n\"No,\" rejoined the clergyman reflectively; \"you are quite right. It is\nnot a problem to be solved by money. The young woman must be given a\nchance to win her way back to respectability by her own efforts. Do I\nunderstand that she is willing to try if the opportunity should present\nitself?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't say that she is--not without reservation,\" Connie\nadmitted. \"You see, she knows the cruel side of the world; and she\nis quite sure that any effort she might make would end in defeat and\ndeeper disgrace.\"\n\n\"A very natural apprehension, and one for which there are only too\ngood grounds,\" said the clergyman sadly. \"We are compassionate and\ncharitable in the aggregate, but as individuals I fear we are very\nunmerciful. Had you thought of trying to send her to one of our\ninstitutional homes in the East? I might possibly be able to make such\nrepresentations as would\"--\n\nConstance shook her head. \"Margaret is a Roman Catholic, and I\nsuggested the House of the Good Shepherd in one of our earlier talks.\nShe fought the idea desperately, and I don't know that I blame her.\nShe is just a woman like other women, and I believe she would gladly\nundertake an honest woman's work in the world; but that isn't saying\nshe'd be willing to become a lay-sister.\"\n\n\"No, I suppose not; I quite agree with you. But what else can you do\nfor her?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Doctor Launceston,--oh, I don't know! But I'll never\ngive up till I've done something.\"\n\nIn the momentary afflatus of which fine determination Constance went\nher way again, not wholly comfortless this time, but apparently quite\nas far from the solution of the problem as when she had latched Mrs.\nCalmaine's gate behind her.\n\nAs for the clergyman, the precious fervor of the young enthusiast\nleft a spark in his heart which burst into flame on the following\nSunday morning, when he preached a stirring sermon from the text, \"Who\nis my neighbor?\" to the decorous and well-fed congregation of St.\nCyril's-in-the-Desert.\n\nLeaving the rectory, Constance postponed the quest for that afternoon\nand went to pay her daily visit to Margaret. On the way downtown a\nhappy thought came to her, and she welcomed it as an inspiration,\nsetting it to work as soon as she had put the convalescent's room in\norder.\n\n\"You are feeling better to-day, aren't you, Margaret?\" she began.\n\n\"Yes. I'm thinking I'll be able to go to work again before long; only\nPete Grim mightn't have no use for me.\"\n\nConstance brought the hair-brush, and letting Margaret's luxuriant hair\nfall in heavy masses over the back of the chair, began another of her\nministries of service.\n\n\"Do you really want to go back to the Bijou?\" she asked, knowing well\nenough what the answer would be.\n\n\"You know you needn't to ask that; it's just Pete Grim's place or\nsomething worse. I can't do no different\"--she paused and the fingers\nof her clasped hands worked nervously--\"and you can't help it, Miss\nConstance. I know you've been trying and worrying; but it ain't no use.\"\n\nConnie did not find words to reply at once, but after a little she\nsaid: \"Tell me more about your old home, Margaret.\"\n\n\"I've told you all there was to tell, many's the time since you found\nme with the fever.\"\n\n\"Let me see if I can remember it. You said your father was the village\nblacksmith, and that you used to sit in the shop and watch the sparks\nfly from the anvil as he worked. And when his day's work was done, he\nwould take you on his shoulder and carry you home to your mother, who\ncalled you her pretty colleen, and loved you because you were the only\ngirl. And then\"--\n\n\"Oh, _don't_!\" There was sharp anguish in the cry, and Margaret covered\nher eyes with her hands as if to shut out the picture. Constance waited\nuntil she thought she had given the seed time to germinate. Then she\nwent on.\n\n\"And when you left home they mourned for you, not as one dead, but as\none living and still beloved; and as long as they could keep track of\nyou they begged you to come back to them. Margaret, won't you go?\"\n\nMargaret shook her head in passionate negation. \"I can't--_I can't!_\nthat's the one thing I can't do! Didn't I bring them shame enough and\nmisery enough in the one day? and will I be going back to stir it all\nup again? having the people say, 'There's Pat Gannon's girl come back;\nshe that went to the bad and broke her mother's heart.' Indeed, I'll\nnot do that, Miss Constance, though the saints and the holy angels'll\ntell you I'd do anything else you'd ask.\"\n\nThis was Connie's happy thought; to induce Margaret to go back to her\nparents. When it proved to be but another rope of sand, she allowed it\none sigh and changed front so cheerfully that Margaret never knew the\ncost of the effort.\n\n\"Then we must try something else,\" she insisted. \"I'll never let you go\nback to the theatre--that's settled. You told me once you could trim\nhats. Have you ever done any other kind of sewing?\"\n\nMargaret knelt before her trunk and threw out an armful of her stage\nfinery. \"I made them,\" she said.\n\nConstance examined the work critically. It was good, and she took\ncourage. \"That is our way out of the trouble, Margaret. Why didn't\nwe think of it before? When you are well enough, I'll get you a\nsewing-machine and find you all the work you can do.\"\n\nMargaret went to the window and stood there so long that Constance\nbegan to tremble lest the battle were going evilward at the last\nmoment. The fear was groundless, as she found out when the girl came\nback to kneel and cry silently with her face in Connie's lap.\n\n\"It isn't so much the love of you,\" she sobbed; \"it's the knowing that\nsomebody cares whether the likes of me goes straight to the devil or\nnot. And never so much as a word about behaving myself, or confessing\nto the priest, or anything. Miss Constance,\"--this with uplifted\nface, grown suddenly beautiful and glorified in the outshining of\npenitence,--\"the devil may fly away with me,--he did that same one\nday,--but if he does, I'll not live to leave him have the good of it. I\npromise you that.\"\n\n\"I can trust you,\" said Constance; and she took her leave presently,\nwondering how the many-sided world could so unify itself in its\nmerciless condemnation of the Magdalenes.\n\nWhen she had closed Margaret's door behind her and was halfway to\nthe stair, she heard sounds as of a scuffle coming from a corridor\nintersecting the main hallway at the landing. Her first impulse was to\nretreat to Margaret Gannon's room; but when she recognized Tommie's\nvoice uplifted in alternate plea and imprecation, she went forward\nquickly. At the turn she met a gaunt, unshaven man leading Tommie by\nthe ear, and her indignation slipped the leash without a thought of\nconsequences.\n\n\"Aren't you ashamed of yourself to abuse a child like that!\" she began;\nand then two things happened: Jeffard released the boy, and Constance\nrecognized in the gaunt figure the wreck of the man whom she had bidden\nGod-speed on the stair at the Calmaine dancing party.\n\nJeffard flattened himself against the wall, bowed low, and was about to\napologize, when Tommie, scenting an accusation, proceeded to vindicate\nhimself by exploding a veritable bomb of consternation between the two.\n\n\"I warn't doin' ary single thing, Miss Constance, 'ceptin' jest wot you\ntelled me to do. I caught on to his nibs down on de street an' follered\nhim up yere; an' w'en I was takin' a squint t'rough de keyhole, jest to\nmake sure, he outs an' nabs me.\"\n\nFor one dreadful instant Connie thought she must scream and run away.\nThen her wits came back, and she saw that deliverance could come only\nthrough swift confession.\n\n\"Tommie,\" she said hastily, \"run down and wait for me on the sidewalk.\"\nAnd then to Jeffard: \"The poor boy wasn't to blame; he was doing just\nwhat he had been told to do, and you have a right to ask--to--to\nknow\"--She stopped in pitiable embarrassment, and Jeffard flung himself\ninto the breach with chivalric tact.\n\n\"Not another word, Miss Elliott, I implore you. It isn't the first time\nI have been taken for my double, and in broad daylight at that. May I\ngo down and make my peace with the boy?\"\n\nConstance was too greatly perturbed not to catch gratefully at the\nchance to escape, and she made use of it while Jeffard was talking to\nTommie at the foot of the stair. Taking Constance's nod and smile in\npassing as tokens of amity, the urchin allowed himself to be placated;\nand when Jeffard went back to his room he knew all that Tommie could\ntell him about Miss Elliott and her deeds of mercy.\n\nThat night, before he went out to tramp himself weary, Jeffard did a\ncharacteristic thing. He wrapped his last five-dollar note around a\nbit of plaster dug from the wall, and creeping through the corridor in\nhis stocking feet, tossed the pellet over the transom into Margaret\nGannon's room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nAT the breakfast-table the next morning, Constance had a shock that set\nher nerves a-jangle and banished her appetite. The exciting cause was a\nparagraph in the morning \"Coloradoan\" which her father had been reading\nbetween the fruit and the cereals.\n\n\"I wonder if that isn't the fellow Dick was looking for and couldn't\nfind,\" he queried, passing the paper across the table with his finger\non the suggestive paragraph.\n\nIt was a custom-hardened account of a commonplace tragedy. A man whose\nname was given as George Jeffrey had shot himself an hour before\nmidnight on one of the bridges spanning Cherry Creek. Constance read\nthe story of the tragedy with her father's remark in abeyance, and the\nshock came with the conviction that the self-slain one was Jeffard,\nwhose name might easily become Jeffrey in the hurried notes of a\nnews-gatherer. The meagre particulars tallied accurately with Bartrow's\nterse account of Jeffard's sociological experiment. The suicide was a\nlate-comer from the farther East; he had spent his money in riotous\nliving; and he had latterly been lost to those who knew him best.\n\nIt was characteristic of Stephen Elliott's daughter that she passed the\npaper back to her father without comment, and that she preserved an\noutward presentment of cheerfulness during the remainder of the meal.\nBut when she was free she ran up to her room and was seen no more of\nher father or her cousin until the latter went upstairs an hour later\nto see if Connie were ready for her morning walk.\n\n\"Why, Connie, dear! What is the matter?\"\n\nSince her tap at the door went unanswered, Myra had turned the knob and\nentered. Connie was lying in a dejected little heap on the floor before\nthe fireless grate. She shook her head in dumb protest at her cousin's\nquestion; but when Myra knelt beside her it all came out brokenly.\n\n\"You didn't see what poppa gave me to read: it was an account of a\nsuicide. Mr. Jeffard has killed himself, and--and, oh, Myra! it's all\nmy fault!\"\n\n\"Mr. Jeffard? Oh, I remember now,--Mr. Bartrow's friend. But I don't\nunderstand; how could it have been your fault?\"\n\n\"It was, it was! Don't you remember what Dick said? that Mr. Jeffard\nwas in trouble, and that he had a place for him? I saw him yesterday,\nand I--_I didn't tell him!_\"\n\n\"But, Connie, dear, how could you? You didn't know him.\" Getting no\nmore than a smothered sob in reply to this, Myra asked for particulars,\nand Connie gave them sparingly.\n\n\"You say the name was George Jeffrey? Why do you think it was Mr.\nJeffard? I can't for the life of me see how you are to blame, in the\nremotest sense; but if you are, it's foolish to grieve over it until\nyou are quite sure of the identities. Isn't there any way you can find\nout?\"\n\nConnie sat up at that, but she refused to be comforted.\n\n\"There is a way, and I'll try it; but it's no use, Myra. I'm just as\nsure as if I had stood beside him when he did it. And I shall never,\n_never_ forgive myself!\"\n\nShe got up and bathed her eyes, and when she had made herself ready to\ngo out, she refused Myra's proffer of company.\n\n\"No, dear; thank you, but I'd rather go alone,\" she objected; \"I'll\nshare the misery of it with you by and by, perhaps, but I can't just\nyet.\"\n\nHer plan for making sure was a simple one. Tommie Reagan had known\nJeffard living, and he would know him dead. Putting it in train, she\nfound her small henchman selling papers on his regular beat in front of\nthe Opera House; and inasmuch as he was crying the principal fact of\nthe tragedy, she was spared the necessity of entering into details.\n\n\"Tommie, have you--did you go to see the man who killed himself last\nnight?\" she questioned.\n\n\"Nope; der ain't no morbid cur'osity inside o' me.\"\n\n\"Would you go?--if I asked you to?\"\n\n\"W'y, cert; I'd take a squint at de old feller wid de hoofs an' horns\nif it'd do you any good.\"\n\n\"Then I'll tell you why I want you to go. I am afraid it is the man we\nwere going to try to help.\"\n\nThe boy shut one eye and whistled softly. \"My gosh! but dat's tough,\nain't it now! An' jest w'en I'd got 'quainted with him an' was a-fixin'\nto give him a lift! Dat's wot I call hard luck!\"\n\nConstance felt that the uncertainty was no longer to be borne. \"Go\nquickly, Tommie,\" she directed; \"and hurry back as soon as you can.\nI'll wait for you in the drug store across the street.\"\n\nThe coroner's office was not far to seek, and the small scout was back\nin a few minutes.\n\n\"Dey wouldn't lemme look,\" he reported, \"but I skinned round to where I\ncould see de top o' his head. It's his nibs, right 'nough.\"\n\n\"Tommie! Are you quite sure?\"\n\n\"Nope; feller ain't sure o' nothin' in dis world, 'ceptin' death an' de\npenitenchry,\" amended Tommie, doing violence to his convictions when he\nsaw that his patron saint was sorely in need of comfort. \"Maybe 'tain't\nhim, after all. You jest loaf 'round yere a couple o' shakes while I\nskip down to his hotel an' see wot I can dig up.\"\n\nThe boy was gone less than a quarter of an hour, but to Constance the\nminutes marched leaden-footed. When Tommie returned, his face signaled\ndiscomfiture.\n\n\"I didn't send me card up,\" he explained, with impish gravity; \"I jest\nwent right up to his nibsey's room an' mogged in, a-thinkin' I'd offer\nhim a paper if he happened to be there and kicked. Say, Miss Constance;\n'tain't a-goin' ter do no good to cry about it. He ain't there, an' he\nain't been there, 'nless he slep' in a chair.\"\n\nConstance went home with a lump in her throat and her trouble writ\nlarge on her face, and Myra needed not to ask the result of the\ninvestigation. Miss Van Vetter was not less curious than she should\nhave been, but something in Connie's eyes forestalled inquiry, and Myra\nheld her peace.\n\nConnie wore out the day as best she might, widening the rift of sorrow\nuntil it bade fair to become an abyss of remorse. When evening came,\nand with it a telegram from Bartrow, asking if she had yet learned\nJeffard's whereabouts, it was too much, and she shared the misery\nwith her cousin, as she had promised to, making a clean breast of it\nfrom the beginning. Something to her surprise, Myra heard her through\nwithout a word of condemnation or reproach.\n\n\"Now that is something I can understand,\" said Myra, when the tale\nwas told. \"The most of your charity work seems to me to be pitifully\ncommonplace and inconsequent; but here was a mission which asked for\nall sorts of heroism, for which it promised to pay the highest of all\nprices, namely, the possibility of saving a man worth the trouble.\"\n\nNow Connie was well assured that her love for her neighbor was no\nrespecter of persons, and she made answer accordingly.\n\n\"I can't agree with you there, Myra. Mr. Jeffard's possible worth had\nnothing to do with it. I wanted to help him because--well, because it\nwas mean in me to make him talk about himself that night at the opera.\nAnd besides, when I met him the next evening at Mrs. Calmaine's, he\ntold me enough to make me quite sure that he needed all the help and\nencouragement he could get. Of course, he didn't say anything like\nthat, you know; but I knew.\"\n\nMyra's eyes promised sympathy, and Connie went on.\n\n\"Then, when I came upon him yesterday I was angry because he was\nhurting Tommie. And afterward, when I tried to explain, he made me\nunderstand that I mustn't reach down to him; and--and I didn't know any\nother way to go about it.\"\n\n\"That was a situation in which I should probably have horrified you,\"\nsaid Myra decisively. \"I shouldn't have noticed or known anything about\nhim at first, as you did; but in your place yesterday, and with your\nknowledge of the circumstances, I should have said my say whether he\nwanted to hear it or not. And I'd have made him listen to reason, too.\"\n\n\"You don't quite understand, Myra. It seemed altogether impossible;\nthough if I had known what was in his mind I should have spoken at any\ncost.\"\n\nTwenty times the pendulum of the chalet clock on the wall beat the\nseconds, and Myra was silent; then she crossed over to Connie's chair\nand sat upon the arm of it.\n\n\"Connie, dear, you're crying again,\"--this with her arm around her\ncousin's neck. \"Are you quite sure you haven't been telling me\nhalf-truths? Wasn't there the least little bit of a feeling warmer than\ncharity in your heart for this poor fellow?\"\n\nConstance shook her head, but the denial did not set itself in words.\n\"He was Dick's friend, and that was enough,\" she replied.\n\nMiss Van Vetter's lips brushed her cousin's cheek, and Constance felt a\nwarm tear plash on her hand. This was quite another Myra from the one\nshe thought she knew, and she said as much.\n\n\"We're all puzzles, Connie dear, and the answers to most of us have\nbeen lost; but, do you know, I can't help crying a little with you for\nthis poor fellow. Just to think of him lying there with no one within\na thousand miles to care the least little bit about it. And if you are\nright--if it is Mr. Bartrow's friend--it's so much the more pitiful.\nThe world is poorer when such men leave it.\"\n\n\"Why, Myra! What do you know about him?\"\n\n\"Nothing more than you do--or as much. But surely you haven't forgotten\nwhat Mr. Bartrow told us.\"\n\n\"About his helping Mr. Lansdale?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"No, I hadn't forgotten.\"\n\n\"It was very noble; and so delicately chivalrous. It seems as if\none who did such things would surely be helped in his own day of\nmisfortune. But that doesn't often happen, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"No,\" Constance assented, with a sigh; and Myra went back to the\nquestion of identity.\n\n\"I suppose there is no possible chance that Tommie may have been\nmistaken?\"\n\nConstance shook her head. \"I think not; he saw that I was troubled\nabout it, and he would have strained a point to comfort me if the\nfacts had given him leave. But I shall be quite sure before I answer\nDick's message.\"\n\nWith that thought in mind, and with no hope behind it, Constance\nwaylaid her father in the hall the next morning as he was about to go\nout.\n\n\"Poppa, I want you to do something for me; no, not that\"--the elderly\nman was feeling in his pockets for his check-book--\"it is something\nvery different, this time; different and--and rather dreadful. You\nremember the suicide you read about, yesterday morning?\"\n\n\"Did I read about one? Oh, yes; the man that shot himself down on the\nPlatte, or was it Cherry Creek? The fellow I thought might be Dick's\nfriend. What about it?\"\n\n\"It's that. We ought to make sure of it for Dick's sake, you know.\nWon't you go to the coroner's office and see if it is Mr. Jeffard? It's\na horrible thing to ask you to do, but\"--\n\nThere was grim reminiscence in the old pioneer's smile. \"It won't be\nthe first one I've seen that died with his boots on. I'll go and locate\nyour claim for you.\"\n\nShe kissed him good-by, but he came back from the gate to say: \"Hold\non, here; I don't know your Mr. Jeffard from a side of sole leather.\nHow am I going to identify him?\"\n\n\"You've seen him once,\" she explained. \"Do you remember the man who sat\nnext to me the night we went to hear 'The Bohemian Girl'?\"\n\n\"The thirsty one that you and Myra made a bet on? Yes, I recollect him.\"\n\n\"I don't think he was thirsty. Would you know him if you were to see\nhim again?\"\n\n\"I guess maybe I would; I've seen him half a dozen times since,--met\nhim out here on the sidewalk the next morning. Is that your man?\"\n\n\"That was Mr. Jeffard,\" she affirmed, turning away that he might not\nsee the tears that welled up unbidden.\n\n\"All right; I'll go and identify him for you.\"\n\nSo he said, and so he meant to do; but it proved to be a rather\nexciting day at the Mining Exchange, and he forgot the commission until\nhe was about to board a homeward-bound car in the evening. Then he\nfound that he was too late. The body of the suicide had been shipped\nEast in accordance with telegraphic instructions received at noon. When\nhe made his report to Constance, she fell back upon Tommie's assurance,\nand sent the delayed answer to Bartrow's message, telling him that his\nfriend was dead.\n\nHaving sorrowfully recorded all these things in the book of facts\naccomplished, it was not wonderful that Constance, coming out of\nMargaret Gannon's room late the following afternoon, should cover her\nface and cry out in something akin to terror when she cannoned against\nJeffard at the turn in the dingy hallway. Neither was it remarkable\nthat her strength should forsake her for the moment; nor that Jeffard,\nseeing her plight, should forget his degradation and give her timely\nhelp by leading her to a seat in the dusty window embrasure. At that\nthe conventionalities, or such shreds of them as might still have bound\neither of them, parted asunder in the midst, and for the time being\nthey were but a man and a woman, as God had created them.\n\n\"Oh, I'm so glad!\" were her first words. \"I--I thought you were dead!\"\n\n\"I ought to be,\" was his comment. \"But what made you think that?\"\n\n\"It was in the newspaper--about the man who shot himself. I was afraid\nit was you, and when Tommie had been to see we were sure of it.\"\n\n\"In the newspaper?\" he queried; and then, with a ghost of a smile which\nwas mirthless: \"It was a little previous, but so justifiable that I\nreally ought to take the hint. Can't you tell me more? I'm immensely\ninterested.\"\n\nShe told him everything from the beginning, concluding with a pathetic\nlittle appeal for forgiveness if she had done wrong in taking too much\nfor granted.\n\n\"You couldn't well do that,\" he hastened to say. \"And you mustn't ask\nforgiveness for motives which an angel might envy. But it is casting\npearls before swine in my case, Miss Elliott. I have sown the wind,\ndeliberately and with malice aforethought, and now I am reaping the\nwhirlwind, and regretting day by day that it doesn't develop sufficient\nviolence to finish that which it has begun.\"\n\n\"Please don't say that,\" she pleaded. \"There are always hands\nstretched out to help us, if we could but see and lay hold of them. Why\nwon't you let Dick help you when he is so anxious to do it? You will,\nnow that you know about it, won't you?\"\n\n\"I knew about it before. Lansdale told me, but I made him promise to\ndrop it. It isn't that I wouldn't accept help from Bartrow as willingly\nas I would from any one in the world; it is simply that I don't care to\ntake the chance of adding ingratitude to my other ill-doings.\"\n\n\"Ingratitude?\"\n\n\"Yes. The man who allows his friend to help him in any crisis of his\nown making should at least be able to give bond for his good behavior.\nI can't do that now. I wouldn't trust myself to go across the street. I\nknow my own potentiality for evil too well.\"\n\n\"But potentiality isn't evil,\" she protested. \"It's only the power to\ndo things, good or bad. And if one have that there is always hope.\"\n\n\"Not for me,\" he said shortly. \"I have sinned against grace.\"\n\n\"Who hasn't?\" Constance rejoined. \"But grace doesn't die because it's\nsinned against.\"\n\nHe smiled again at that. \"I think my particular allotment of grace is\ndead beyond the hope of resurrection.\"\n\n\"How can that be?\"\n\nHe put his back to the window so that he had not to look in her eyes.\n\n\"Grace for most men takes the form of an ideal. So long as the\ncondition to be attained is ahead there is hope, but when one has\nturned his back upon it\"--\n\nIndirection fences badly with open-eyed sincerity, and he did not\nfinish. But the door was open now, and Constance meant to do her whole\nduty.\n\n\"I think I understand,\" she assented; \"but I wish you would be quite\nfrank with me. In a way, I am Mr. Bartrow's deputy, and if I have to\ntell him you refuse to let him help you, I shall have to give him a\nbetter reason than you have given me.\"\n\n\"You are inexorable,\" he said, and there was love in his eyes, despite\nhis efforts reasonward. \"I wish I dared tell you the whole miserable\ntruth.\"\n\n\"And why may you not?\"\n\n\"Because it concerns--a woman.\"\n\nShe shrank back a little at that, and he saw that she had\nmisunderstood. Wherefore he plunged recklessly into the pool of\nfrankness.\n\n\"The woman is a good woman,\" he went on quickly, \"and one day not so\nvery long ago I loved her well enough to believe that I could win my\nway back to decency and uprightness for her sake. It was a mistake. I\nhad fallen lower than I knew, and the devil came in for his own.\"\n\nHere was something tangible to lay hold of at last, and Connie made\ninstant use of it.\n\n\"Does she know?\" she asked.\n\nThe mirthless smile came and went again. \"She thinks she does.\"\n\n\"But you haven't told her all; is that it?\"\n\n\"I have tried to, but, being a good woman, she can't understand. I\nthink I didn't fully understand, myself; but I do now.\"\n\n\"Is it so far beyond reparation?\"\n\n\"It is indeed. If the devil's emissary who has brought me to this pass\ncould be exorcised this moment I should never recover the lost ground\nof self-respect. There is nothing to go back to. If I had not to be\ndespicable from necessity, I should doubtless be so from choice.\"\n\n\"I think you are harder with yourself than you would be with another.\nCan't you begin to believe in yourself again? _I_ believe in you.\"\n\n\"You!--but you don't know what you are saying, Miss Elliott. See!\"--his\ncoat was buttoned to the chin, tramp-wise, and he tore it open to show\nher the rags that underlay it--\"do you understand now? I have pawned\nthe shirt off my back--not to satisfy the cravings of hunger, but to\nfeed a baser passion than that of the most avaricious miser that ever\nlived. Do I make it plain that I am not worthy of your sympathy, or of\nRichard Bartrow's?\"\n\nFor once the clear gray eyes were veiled, and her chin quivered a\nlittle when she spoke. \"You hurt me more than I can tell,\" she said.\n\nThe dull rage of self-abasement in him flamed into passion at the sight\nof what he had done, but the bitter speech of it tarried at the sound\nof a heavy step on the stair. Constance rose from her seat in the\nwindow embrasure with a nervous thrill of embarrassment, but Jeffard\nrelieved her at once. There was a vacant room on the opposite side of\nthe corridor, and when the intruder appeared at the stair-head, Miss\nElliott was alone.\n\nShe glanced at the man as he passed, and Jeffard, from his place\nbehind the half-closed door of the vacant room, saw her draw back,\nand clenched his hands and swore softly, because, forsooth, she had\nfor some fleeting pulse-beat of time to breathe the same air with the\nintruder. For he knew the man as a purveyor for Peter Grim's house of\ndishonor; a base thing for which wholesome speech has no name.\n\nWhat followed was without sequence. Almost at the same instant the\nfootsteps of the man ceased to echo in the empty corridor, there was\na cry half angry and half of terror from Margaret Gannon's room, and\nMiss Elliott disappeared from Jeffard's limited field of vision. In the\nturning of a leaf Jeffard was at the door of the room in the end of\nthe corridor. What he saw and heard made a man of him for the moment.\nMargaret Gannon had evidently been surprised at her sewing-machine; the\nwork was still under the needle, and the chair was overturned. Margaret\nwas crouching in the farthest corner of the room, with Miss Elliott\nstanding over her like a small guardian angel at bay. The nameless one\nhad his back to the door, and Jeffard heard only the conclusion of a\njeering insult which included both of the women.\n\nNow Jeffard had fasted for twenty-four hours, and the quick dash to\nthe end of the corridor made him dizzy and faint; but red wrath, so\nit be fierce enough, is its own elixir. Thinking of nothing but that\nhe should acquit himself as a man before the woman he loved, he flung\nhimself upon the contemner of women with the vigor of a righteous cause\nsinging in his veins like the wine of new life.\n\nThe struggle was short and decisive. In his college days Jeffard had\nbeen a man of his hands, and the fierce onset proved to be the better\nhalf of the battle. Constance caught her breath and cowered in the\ncorner with Margaret when the two men went down together, but she gave\na glad little cry when she saw that Jeffard had won the fall; that\nhe had wrenched the drawn pistol from the other's grasp and flung it\nharmless across the room. Then there was another and a fiercer grapple\non the floor, and Jeffard's fist rose and fell like a blacksmith's\nhammer with the dodging head of his antagonist for its anvil.\n\nThe end of it was as abrupt as the beginning. In the midst of another\nwrestling bout the beaten one freed himself, bounded to his feet, and\ndarted into the corridor with Jeffard at his heels. There was a sharp\nscurry of racing feet in the hall, a prolonged crash as of a heavy body\nfalling down the stair, and Jeffard was back again, panting with the\nviolence of it, but with eyes alight and an apology on his lips.\n\nConstance ran to meet him and cut the apology short.\n\n\"The idea!\" she protested; \"when it was for Margaret's sake and mine!\nAre you sure you're not hurt?\"\n\nJeffard's knuckles were cut and bleeding, but he kept that hand behind\nhim.\n\n\"It's the other fellow who is hurt, I hope.\" Then to Margaret: \"Do you\nknow him? Are you afraid of him?\"\n\nMargaret glanced at Constance and hesitated. \"He'll not be troubling me\nany more, I'm thinking. It's Pete Grim that sent him; and he was at me\nbefore I knew.\"\n\nJeffard picked up the captured weapon and put it on the sewing-machine.\n\n\"Take that to him if he comes again when you are alone. Miss Elliott,\nplease stay here a moment until I can go down and see that the way is\nclear.\"\n\nHe was gone at the word, but he had barely reached the window with the\ndusty embrasure when she overtook him. There was a sweet shyness in\nher manner now, and he trembled as he had not in any stage of the late\nencounter.\n\n\"Mr. Jeffard,\" she began, \"will you forgive me if I say that you have\ndisproved all the hard things you were trying to say of yourself?\nYou'll let me wire Dick, now, won't you?\"\n\nHe shook his head because he was afraid to trust himself to speak. As\nbetween an abject appeal with his hopeless passion for its motive, and\na plunge back into the abyss of degradation which would efface the\ntemptation, there was nothing to choose.\n\n\"You will at least promise me that you will consider it,\" she went on.\n\"I can't ask less.\"\n\nIf he did not reply immediately it was because he was trying to fix\nher image so that he should always be able to think of her just as she\nstood, with the afternoon sunlight falling upon her face, irradiating\nit and making a shimmering halo of the red-brown hair and deep wells\nof the clear gray eyes. A vagrant thought came to him: that it was\nworth a descent into the nether depths to have such a woman seek him\nout and plead with him for his soul's sake. He put it aside to deny her\nentreaty.\n\n\"I can't promise even that.\"\n\nShe was silent for a moment, and embarrassment came back and fought for\nholding-ground when she tried to bring herself to do the thing which\ncompassion suggested. But compassion won; and Jeffard looked on with a\nhalf-cynical smile when she took a gold coin from her purse and offered\nit to him.\n\n\"Just for the present,\" she begged, with a beseeching look which might\nhave melted a worse man.\n\nHe took the money, and the smile ended in an unpleasant laugh.\n\n\"You think I ought to refuse, and so I ought; as any man would who had\na spark of manhood left in him. But that is why I take it; I have been\ntrying to make you understand that I am not worth saving. Do I make it\nplain to you?\"\n\n\"You make me very sorry,\" she quavered; and because her sorrow\nthrottled speech, she turned and left him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nAFTER Constance had gone, Jeffard had an exceedingly bad half-hour. For\na time he tramped up and down the deserted corridor, calling himself\nhard names and likening his latest obliquity to whatsoever unpardonable\nsin has been recorded against the most incorrigible of mankind. Love\nhad its word, also--outraged love, acknowledged only to be openly\nflouted and spat upon; for one may neither do violence to a worthy\npassion, nor give rein to an unworthy, without paying for it, blow for\nblow. What would she think of him? What could she think, save that she\nhad wasted her sympathy on a shameless vagabond who had sought to palm\nhimself off on her and her friends as a gentleman?\n\nThe thought of it was stifling. The air of the musty hallway seemed\nsuddenly to grow suffocating, and the muffled drumming of the\nsewing-machine in Margaret Gannon's room jarred upon him until it drove\nhim forth to wander hot-hearted and desperate in the streets.\n\nWithout remembering that he had crossed the viaduct or ascended the\nhill, he finally found himself wandering in the Highlands. Drifting\naimlessly on beyond the fringe of suburban houses, he came to the\nborders of a shallow pond what time the sun was poising for its plunge\nbehind the upreared mountain background in the west. It was here, when\nhe had flung himself down upon the warm brown earth in utter weariness\nof soul and body, that his good angel came once more and wrestled with\nhim.\n\nLooking backward he saw that the angle of the inclined plane had grown\nsuddenly precipitous within a fortnight. Since the night of his quarrel\nwith the well-meaning miner, the baize door at the head of the carpeted\nstair had been closed to him. In consequence he had been driven to the\nlair of a less carefully groomed but more rapacious wild beast whose\nkeeper offered his patrons a choice between the more serious business\nof the gaming-tables, and the lighter diversions of a variety theatre.\nJeffard had seen the interior of the Bijou on the earliest of his\ninvestigative expeditions in Denver, and had gone away sick at heart\nat the sight of it. Wherefore it was a measure of the depths to which\nhe had descended that he could become an habitue of the place, caring\nnothing for the misery and depravity which locked arms with all who\nbreathed its tainted atmosphere.\n\nIt was at the Bijou that he had lost the better part of the winnings\nrescued by the miner's bit of charitable by-play; and it was there,\nalso, that he had thrown away the major portion of a second gift from\nLansdale. For two nights in succession the lack of money had kept him\naway.\n\nHe took out Connie's offering and stared at it with lack-lustre eyes.\nWith heedful manipulation here was the fuel to feed the fire of\nhis besetting passion for some hours. Having permitted her to give\nand himself to take it, why should he quibble at the manner of its\nspending? When he saw that hesitancy implied another attempt to turn\nback at the eleventh hour, he felt that this was no longer possible.\nTry as he might, the shame of this last infamous thing would reach out\nand drag him back into the mire.\n\nThe alternative disposed of, the matter simplified itself. He had only\nto determine whether he should end it all before or after he had flung\naway this bit of yellow metal. The decision was so nicely balanced\nthat he let it turn upon the flipping of the coin--heads for a sudden\nplunge into the pond, tails for a final bout with chance and the plunge\nafterward.\n\nHe spun the gold piece, and went down on his hands and knees to read\nthe oracle in the fading light. It was the misshapen eagle that stared\nback at him from the face of the coin, and he took his reprieve\nsullenly, calling his evil genius a usurer.\n\nHe got upon his feet stiffly and turned his face toward the city. Then\nit occurred to him that it would be well to make his preparations while\nhe could see. There was a house building on the little knoll above the\npond; a brick and the binding-string from a bundle of lath would serve;\nand when he had secured them he sounded the pond around the edges with\na stick. It was too shallow; but from a plank thrown across to the head\nof the drainage flume it proved deep enough, and here he left the brick\nand the bit of tarred twine.\n\nHalf an hour later he entered the Bijou. On the threshold he met the\nproprietor; and when he would have passed with a nod, Grim barred the\nway.\n\n\"Been layin' for you,\" announced the man of vice, sententiously. \"Come\ninto the box-office.\"\n\nJeffard obeyed mechanically. He was in the semi-stupor which\nanticipates the delirium of the gaming fever, and the man's voice\nsounded afar off. Grim led the way behind the bar to a windowless den\nfurnished with a roll-top desk and two chairs. Closing the door, he\nwaved Jeffard to a seat.\n\n\"Been sort o' sizin' you up lately, and I put it up that you're out o'\nluck. Does that call the turn?\"\n\n\"I don't know how that concerns you,\" said Jeffard, with a sudden\naccess of dull resentment.\n\n\"No more do I; but that's neither here nor yonder. You're down on your\nluck, ain't you?\"\n\nJeffard nodded. \"Call it that, if you like.\"\n\n\"Thought so. Broke most of the time, I reckon?\"\n\n\"Yes; most of the time.\"\n\n\"Jes' so. Well, I'm goin' to put you on to a soft snap. I know all\nabout you--who you are, where you come from, and all the rest. You've\nbeen playin' to lose right along, and now I'm goin' to give you a tip\nso you can play to win ever' time. See?\"\n\nJeffard came out of his abstraction sufficiently to wonder what the\nman was driving at. \"Make it short,\" he rejoined curtly.\n\nGrim leaned back in his pivot-chair, and his hard face wrinkled under\nan evil smile.\n\n\"Don't be in a rush. Game runs all night, and you'll have plenty of\ntime to go and blow in whatever you've got after I get through with\nyou. Or, if you can't wait, go and blow it first, and we'll talk\nbusiness afterwards.\"\n\n\"No,\" Jeffard objected sullenly. \"If you have anything to say to me,\nsay it now.\"\n\n\"Business before pleasure, eh? All right; here's the lay-out. I'm goin'\nto stake you with a suit o' good clothes, pay your board at the Albany\nor the Brown, whichever you like, and give you a roll to flash up\nthat'll make you feel flush ever' time you look at it. Then\"--\n\nJeffard's gesture was of impatience.\n\n\"Never mind about the details. What is the price of all this?\"\n\n\"Mighty nigh nothin' at all. You had plenty o' friends a while back,\nand you'll have 'em again, as soon as you're flush. And when any of 'em\nfeel like proddin' the tagger, why--you know where he's kep'; that's\nall.\"\n\nWhile one might draw a breath there was murder in Jeffard's heart; in\nhis weakness a rage that was childish in its vehemence took possession\nof him, and he covered his face with his hands to crush back the hot\ntears of impotence which sprang up and blinded him. Grim looked on\nunpityingly, waiting for what he conceived to be the inevitable. When\nJeffard struggled to his feet, his face was white and he had to steady\nhimself by the back of the chair.\n\n\"I thought I'd got to the bottom when I came here to-night,\" he began\nunsteadily, \"but you've shown me my mistake. Thank God, I can yet say\nNo to you, low as I am. Let me get out of here.\"\n\nKnowing the strength of the gambler's chain, as well as the length\nthereof, Grim held his peace; and Jeffard pushed past the bar-tender\nand went out through the small door at the end of the bar. On the\nsidewalk a crowd beset the theatre entrance, and out of the midst of it\ncame two men, striking and clutching at each other as they fought their\nway into the clear. Within arm's-length of Jeffard they separated. He\nsaw the sheen of the electric light on a weapon, and darted between\nthem in time to spoil the aim of the man who drew first. There was a\nflash and a report, a rush on the part of the crowd, and Jeffard found\nhimself dodging and doubling swiftly through dark alleys and crooked\ncovered ways, following the lead of the man whose life he had saved.\nAfter a time they came out in a silent street where there was light.\n\n\"Didn't know me, did you, pardner?\" quoth the fugitive, relaxing his\ngrasp on Jeffard's wrist. \"Like as not you wouldn't 'a' done it if you\nhad, but that don't saw no wood with me. That greaser had the drop on\nme, sure's yer born.\"\n\nWhereupon Jeffard looked again, and recognizing his friendly enemy of\nthe winning night, was glad, inasmuch as he had been able to cancel an\nobligation. None the less, his reply was ungracious enough.\n\n\"Oh, it's you, is it? Well, we're quits now. Good-night.\"\n\nHe turned and walked away, but at the corner the man overtook him.\n\"Not that-a-way,\" he forbade, pointing up the street. \"Somebody in the\ncrowd'll be sure to know you, and you'll walk slap back into trouble\nafter I done drug you out. The p'lice are there by this time, an' they\ndon't care who, so they get a man 'r two to lock up.\"\n\nJeffard nodded, and made a circuit of the dangerous locality with his\nhead up and the light of a steadfast purpose in his eyes. Whatever\nof vacillation there was in him an hour earlier had been thoroughly\nflailed out in the brief interview with Peter Grim. He knew now what he\nhad to do, and the precise manner of its doing.\n\nKeeping to the quieter streets, he came out in front of the St. James;\nand dodging the crowded lobby, made his way to the writing-room. Since\nhe dare not go to the clerk for stationery, he was compelled to wait\nuntil some one left what he required. The chance befell presently,\nbut when he came to write his note to Constance Elliott the thing was\nharder to do than he had prefigured it. What he finally wrote, after he\nhad spoiled two of the three sheets of paper left by his predecessor in\nthe chair at the writing-table, was this:--\n\n\"After what happened this afternoon, you will not think worse of me if\nI ask you to let me try to explain what must seem to you too despicable\nto be remembered. I can't hope to make you understand without being\nfrank, and when, at some future time, you may learn the circumstances\nunder which this is written, I shall hope for forgiveness.\n\n\"You may remember that I said I couldn't tell you the truth, because\nit concerns a woman. When I add that the woman is yourself, you will\nunderstand. I love you; I think I have been loving you ever since that\nevening which you said we were to forget--the evening at the theatre.\nStrangely enough, my love for you isn't strong in the strength which\nsaves. I went from you that night when you had bidden me God-speed\nat Mrs. Calmaine's, and within the hour I was once more a penniless\nvagabond.\n\n\"When you were trying to help me this afternoon, I was trying to keep\nfrom saying that which I could never have a right to say. You pressed\nme very hard in your sweet innocence and loving sympathy,--you see,\nI am quite frank,--and when you finally gave me a chance to make the\nimpossible thing that I longed to say still more impossible, I took it\nin sheer desperation. Nay, more; I purposed in my heart to so desecrate\nyour gift as to make the thought of my love for you an unhallowed\nmemory.\n\n\"That is all, I think, save, when it came to the brink, I found that\nthere was still a deeper depth which was yet unplumbed, and which I\ntrust I shall have the courage to leave unexplored.\"\n\nWhen it was finished he wrapped the gold piece in a bit of paper, and,\nputting it in the envelope with the note, set out to find the house in\nColfax Avenue. Having seen it but once, and that in daylight, it was\nnot singular that it eluded him in the night; but it was surely the\nvery irony of chance which led him to slip the envelope under the front\ndoor of a house two squares beyond that occupied by the Elliotts, and\nwhich kept him from noticing the placard \"For Rent\" nailed upon the\nvery door under which he thrust his message to Constance.\n\nThis single preliminary set in order, he faced once more toward the\nHighlands, lagging a little from sheer weariness as he went, but\nfinding comfort in the thought that there would be infinite surcease\nfrom hunger and exhaustion at the end of this last pilgrimage.\n\nThere was time for reflection on the way, and he marvelled that\nhis thoughts dwelt so persistently upon the trivial details of the\nthing he was about to do. He was a practiced swimmer; would the\nweight of a single brick be sufficient to overcome the instinct of\nself-preservation which might assert itself at the last moment?\nProbably, since he was weak from fasting, and would be encumbered with\nhis clothing. Then another suggestion came to torment him: If he should\ntie the brick to his feet, as he had thought to, the water might not\nbe deep enough, after all. Consequently, he must fasten it about his\nneck. And thereupon he had a fit of creeping horror at the thought of\ndrowning with his face dragged down into the ooze and slime of the\nbottom.\n\nOddly enough, when he came to the brink of the pool these things ceased\nto trouble him; though even there it was impossible to turn the current\nof thought into a reflective channel. He made the effort for decency's\nsake. It was not meet that a thinking being should go out of life like\nthe brutes that perish; without a thought for the past with its lacks\nand havings, or the future with its untried possibilities. But the\neffort returned to him void, and presently he stumbled upon the reason:\nthe premeditated fact of self-murder shut him off alike from repentance\nfor what had gone before, and from hope in what should come after.\n\nVery good, he said; and flung himself down to make the most of the\npresent. He was faint and weary, and it would be ill to drown a tired\nbody. There was no moon, but the midsummer night was clear and still.\nThe stars burned steadily overhead, and there was a soft light abroad\nwhich seemed to be a part of the atmosphere. Over in the west the black\nbulk of the range rose up to meet the sky; and poised above one of the\nhighest peaks the planet Mars swung to its setting. Jeffard marked it,\nsaying it should be his executioner; that when the rosy point of light\nshould touch the black sky-line, he would rise up and go to his place.\n\nMeanwhile it was soothing to lie stretched out upon the warm earth\nwith no human future to prefigure, and no past insistent enough to\ndisturb one with its annals. And there was still the present, with its\nsoft light and its dim hemisphere of sky; its balmy air and its vague\nand shadowy horizon. It was good to be alone with nature in these last\nfew moments; to have done with the tiresome world of man's marring; to\nbe quit of man's presence.\n\nThe thought had scarcely shaped itself when it was made of none effect\nby the appearance of a man at the top of the little knoll. The intruder\ncame straight on, as if in no doubt as to his purpose, and sitting down\non the end of the plank bridge, proceeded to fill and light his pipe\nwithout saying a word. Jeffard caught a glimpse of a bearded face by\nthe flare of the match, and said, \"Oh, it's you again, is it?\"\n\n\"Right you are, pardner. Hope I ain't intrudin'.\"\n\n\"I suppose you have as good a right here as I have. But I might suggest\nthat the night is fine and the world large, and that there are times\nwhen a man has no use for his fellows.\"\n\nThe new-comer smoked in silence for a full minute before he removed his\npipe to say:--\n\n\"That's a sort of a gilt-edged invitation for me to mog off, ain't it?\nAll right; I'll go pretty middlin' quick; but I've been fool enough to\ntramp somewheres nigh ten mile behind you to-night for to get a show\nto say what's on my mind; wher'fore, I'll say it first and vamoose\nafte'wards.\"\n\nJeffard gave him leave, watching the narrowing margin between the star\nand the mountain-top.\n\n\"Well, b'iled down, it's just about this: I know what you're out yere\nfor,--seen it in your eye back yonder on the street corner,--but I\nsays to myself, 'Jim Garvin, you go kinder slow; it ain't none o' your\nbusiness. When a man takes a mill-run o' hisself and finds out the\nclaim ain't worth workin' no longer, w'y, it's his funeral, and none\no' yourn.' And then again I says to myself, 'Maybe that there feller\nhain't got nary 'nother claim--leastwise, not as he knows of,' and so I\nfollered you, all over the blame' town and out yere.\"\n\nJeffard made no reply, and the intruder went on.\n\n\"'Course, you understand I ain't a-mixin' up any in your business, not\nif I know it. You just listen at what I'm goin' to say, and then if you\nwant to go ahead, w'y, all right, do it; and I'll loan you my gun so 't\nyou won't have to get yourself wet in cold water. Is that about right?\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said Jeffard.\n\n\"Well, it's this-a-way; I'm off on a prospectin' tower to-morrow.\nBlowed in ever' last thing I had, and took a grub-stake, same as\nheretofore. Now the old man that puts up the grub-stake, he says,\nsays he, 'Jim, you'll want a pardner. It's gettin' pretty late in the\nseason, and you won't stand no kind of a chance goin' alone.' 'Right\nyou are,' says I,' and I'll pick up some feller on the range as I go\nin.' 'Good enough,' says he. 'I'll make this here order big enough\nto stake the two of you.' That's the whole lay-out, and you're the\npardner, if you say the word. You don't know beans about me, and I\ndon't know you from Adam's off ox, so that's a stand-off. What do you\nsay?\"\n\nJeffard did not answer until there was but a bare thread of sky between\nthe star and the peak. Then he said: \"Do you happen to have a coin of\nany kind about you?\"\n\nGarvin tossed a dollar across to him, and Jeffard spun it. Then he\nfound that he had no match, and asked the miner to give him one. Garvin\nwatched him curiously as he bent over the coin and struck the match.\n\n\"The luck's against me--it's heads,\" he announced gravely. \"I'll go\nwith you.\"\n\nGarvin rose and stretched himself stiffly.\n\n\"You're a cool one,\" he commented. \"What if it'd been tails?\"\n\nJeffard got up and kicked the brick into the pond. \"In that case I\nshould have been obliged to ask you to lend me your pistol. Let's go\nback to town and get something to eat with that dollar. I haven't had\nanything since last night.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nAFTER toiling all night through black gorges and over unspeakable\nmountain passes, the narrow-gauge train from Denver, headed by two\npygmy locomotives, came out into daylight, sunshine, and wider horizons\nat Alta Vista. In the sleeping-car three sections had been transformed\nby the drowsy porter into daytime smugness, and three persons--two of\nthem in deference to the enthusiasm of the third--were up and dressed.\n\n\"Isn't it all perfectly indescribable?\" Myra was saying, when the\nengineer of one of the pygmies sounded the whistle for the station. \"Do\nyou know, I couldn't go to sleep for hours last night, late as it was.\nI put up the window curtain and piled the pillows in the corner so I\ncould look out. The sky was like a great inverted bowl lined with black\nvelvet and spangled with diamonds, circling around us as we darted\naround the curves. And in the open places there was always a solemn\nprocession of cliffs and peaks, marching with us sometimes, and then\nturning to slip past again when the bowl whirled the other way. Oh, but\nit was grand!\"\n\n\"I'm glad it lays hold of you,\" said Connie, who was loyally jealous\nfor the scenic renown of her native Colorado. \"Now you know why\nI wouldn't let you go on any of those breathless little one-day\nexcursions from Denver. They just take you up in a balloon, give\nyou a glimpse while you gasp, and drop you without a parachute. The\ntourist people all make them, you know,--it's in the itinerary, with\na coupon in the cute little morocco-bound book of tickets,--and they\ncome back wild-eyed and desperate, and go without their suppers to\nscribble incoherent notes about the 'Cache la Platte' and 'Clear Poudre\nCanyon,' and other ridiculous things. It would be funny if it wasn't so\nexasperating.\"\n\nMyra nodded. \"I'm beginning to 'savez,' as Mr. Bartrow would say. By\nthe way, isn't this the place where he was to meet us?--Why, yes; there\nhe is now!\" She waved her hand and struggled with the window-latch as\nthe train drew up to the platform.\n\nHe was with them in a moment, carrying a towel-covered basket, and a\ntin coffee-pot which he waved gingerly by way of salutation.\n\n\"The top o' the morning to you all,\" he said, beaming genially. \"I was\nafraid you wouldn't be up, and then my hot coffee would be cold coffee,\nand I'd get myself disliked.\" Then to the drowsy porter: \"John, you\nscoundrel, get us a table before I break you in two and throw you out\nof the window.\"\n\nThe table was promptly forthcoming, and Myra made room in the narrow\nseat for Bartrow.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" he begged, laughing, \"I'd like to, but I can't. Somebody's\ngot to stand up and do the swing-rack act with this coffee-pot. Just\nunload that basket, will you, Elliott, and I'll play head waiter while\nyou set the table.\"\n\nThe breakfast was good, and there was a most astonishing variety.\nMoreover the coffee rose to a degree of excellence which more than\natoned for the admixture of condensed milk in lieu of cream, and\nfor the slight resinous taste imparted by the new tin cups. Bartrow\napologized for the cups.\n\n\"You see, I left the mine rather middling early this morning, and\npacked things in a hurry. When I was making the coffee over Jim\nBryant's stove here at Alta Vista, it struck me all at once that I'd\nforgotten the cups. The train was in sight, and Jim had only one, and\nthat hadn't been washed for a month of Sundays. Maybe you think I\nwasn't stampeded for about a minute.\"\n\nConnie laughed. \"I suppose you went out and robbed somebody.\"\n\n\"That's what I did; made a break for the store, and found it locked up,\nof course. I had to smash a window to get what I wanted.\"\n\n\"Why, you lawless man!\" protested Myra, trying to make room on the\nnarrow table for the contents of the inexhaustible basket. \"Where in\nthe world did you get such a variety of things?\"\n\n\"Canned goods,\" Connie cut in maliciously; \"all canned goods, put out\nin dishes so you won't be reminded of the tinny taste. Everybody lives\non canned goods in the mountains.\"\n\n\"Connie, you make me tired,\" Bartrow retorted, bracing himself as the\ntrain whisked around a sharp curve. \"Just dig a little deeper and get\nout that platter of trout; they've never seen the inside of a can.\"\n\n\"Never mind what Connie says; she isn't responsible,\" said Myra. \"The\nbreakfast is just as good as it can be. Besides, you know you promised\nus that we should live just as you do if we'd visit the Little Myriad.\nI wish you'd put that coffee-pot on the floor and sit down with us.\"\n\nBartrow tried it, and found it possible; after which the talk became\ngeneral and cheerful over the resinous coffee cups and the lurching\ndishes. In a lull Elliott asked how the Little Myriad was going on.\n\n\"Good enough for anybody,\" rejoined Bartrow, with enthusiasm alert.\n\"Lead opens out better every day, and we're in only about seventy-five\nfeet.\"\n\n\"No pay-dirt yet, of course,\" said the older man.\n\n\"Well, hardly; not yet. I'm figuring on a hundred and fifty feet of\ndevelopment work at the very least before we begin to take out pay.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bartrow, don't you remember that another thing you promised was\nthat you wouldn't talk mineral-English before me without explaining\nit?\" Myra broke in. \"I want to know\"--An unexpected plunge of the car\nmade her grasp at the coffee cup, and Connie slipped deftly into the\nbreak.\n\n\"And it shall know, bless its inquisitive little soul! It shall be\nstuffed with information like a fat little pillow with feathers. But\nnot here, cuzzy dear. Wait till we're on the ground, and then I'll go\noff out of hearing, and Dick may turn himself into a glossary, or an\nintelligence office, or a personal conductor, or anything else you'd\nlike to have him.\"\n\nBartrow looked unspeakable things, and put down his knife and fork to\nsay, \"Connie, you're a--a\"--\n\n\"Brute, Dickie; say it right out, and don't spare me on Myra's account.\nShe rather enjoys it; she loves to hear people abuse me.\"\n\n\"Connie, you are perfectly incorrigible,\" said Myra severely. \"With\nyour poor people you are an angel of light, but with your friends\"--\n\n\"I'm an angel of darkness. That's right, cuzzy dear; pile it on, I'm\nyoung and strong. Poppa, can't you think of something mean to say about\nme? Do try, please.\"\n\nBartrow grinned; and Elliott, who knew his daughter's vagaries and\ndelighted in them, laughed outright. Constance made a face across the\ntable at her cousin, and said, \"Now talk mines, if you can.\"\n\n\"I shall,\" asserted Myra calmly. \"Mr. Bartrow, how did you ever come to\ncall your mine the 'Little Myriad'?\"\n\nIf the bottom had suddenly dropped out of his coffee cup, Bartrow could\nnot have been more disconcerted. Constance, who was in his secret,\nlaughed gleefully, and clapped her hands.\n\n\"Tell her, Dick; tell her all about it. If you don't I shall.\"\n\nBartrow stammered and stumbled until Connie went into ecstasies of\nmischievous delight. After two or three helpless beginnings, he said,\nrather tamely, \"I thought it was a pretty name.\"\n\n\"But it's so odd; a myriad is many, and a mine is only one.\"\n\n\"Oh, the meaning didn't have anything to do with it,\" rejoined Bartrow,\ngoing straight to his own discomfiture with refreshing candor. \"It was\nthe--the suggestion; the similarity; the--By Jove! we're there at last;\nthis is the mine switch.\"\n\nThe exclamation was a heartfelt thanksgiving, and in the confusion of\ndebarking the perilous topic was safely eluded. It was a sharp climb\nof some distance from the railway track to the mine, and Elliott\ndeveloped unsuspected reserves of tact by leading the way with Miss\nVan Vetter, leaving Bartrow to follow with Constance. When they had\nlagged sufficiently behind the others, and were yet out of earshot of\nthe men who were following with the luggage, Bartrow went back to the\nunexploded petard.\n\n\"Connie, you've just got to help me out now,\" he declared. \"What shall\nI tell her if she tackles me again?\"\n\n\"Tell her the truth.\"\n\n\"I don't dare to.\"\n\n\"Then tell her a fib. But no--on second thought I shouldn't do that, if\nI were you; you'd only make a mess of it. I'll tell you what to do:\njust fight shy of it till I can get her to myself. I promise you she'll\nnever ask you about the Little Myriad's christening again as long as\nshe lives.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Bartrow, with the air of a reprieved criminal; and\nthen dubiously: \"See here, Connie, how are you going to do it? No\nmonkey business, you know.\"\n\n\"Not a single, solitary monkey,\" she answered so soberly that Bartrow\nforgot his suspicions, and plunged into another subject which was also\nnear to his heart.\n\n\"About Jeffard; how did you come to think he had shot himself?\"\n\n\"It was only one of those suppositions you think you have verified when\nyou've only been playing blind-man's bluff with it. The similarity of\nnames misled me at first.\"\n\n\"But afterward you merely wired that you were mistaken. Was that\nanother supposition?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; I saw him and talked with him.\"\n\n\"The mischief you did! What did he have to say for himself?\"\n\n\"Not much that will bear repeating. I'm too sorry for him to want to\ntalk about it, Dick.\"\n\nBartrow wondered, and kept his wonder to himself. What he said was in\nthe nature of worldly wisdom.\n\n\"Jeffard'll come out all right in the end. He's as obstinate as a pig,\nbut that's the only swinish thing about him. I'm afraid he'll have to\ngo through the stamp-mill and get himself pulverized; but when it\ncomes to the clean-up there'll be more good metal than tailings. Don't\nyou think so?\"\n\n\"How should I know?\" queried Constance.\n\n\"I didn't ask you what you know; I asked what you thought about it.\"\n\n\"You forget that we've met only two or three times.\"\n\n\"I don't forget anything. But I know you can size a man up while the\nrest of us are trying to get acquainted with him. Don't you believe\nthat Jeffard will come out all right in the end?\"\n\nShe was silent for a minute or two, and when she answered there was a\ntremulous note in her voice which was new to Bartrow.\n\n\"I'm afraid he has made that and everything else impossible, Dick. I\ntold you I had seen him and talked with him; that was the day after I\ntelegraphed you about the suicide, nearly two months ago. From that day\nto this he has not been seen or heard of in Denver, so far as Tommie\ncan find out.\"\n\n\"Pshaw! Then you think he has taken the short cut out of it, after all?\"\n\n\"I don't know what to think,\" said Constance; and as they were at the\ntop of the steep trail, the subject was dropped.\n\nOn the whole, Connie's apprehensions that her cousin's urban upbringing\nmight make her a difficult guest for the young miner were apparently\ngroundless. Miss Van Vetter rhapsodized over the scenery; waded\ncheerfully through the dripping tunnel of the Little Myriad to the\nvery heading, in order to see with her own eyes the vein of mineral;\nthought Bartrow's three-room log cabin was good enough for any one; and\nate the dishes of Wun Ling's preparing as though a Chinese cook were a\nnecessary adjunct to every well regulated household. When the first day\nof exhilarating sight-seeing came to an end, and the two young women\nwere together in their room, Connie bethought her of her promise to\nBartrow.\n\n\"By the way, Myra, did you find out how the Little Myriad came by its\nname?\" she asked.\n\n\"No; I forgot to ask Mr. Bartrow again.\"\n\n\"I can tell you, if you'd really like to know.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"He was going to call it the 'Myra,' and he asked me if I thought you'd\nobject. I told him you would,--most emphatically. Then he said he would\ncall it the 'Myriad,' because that was the only word he could think of\nthat was anything like Myra.\"\n\nMiss Van Vetter was arranging her hair before the small mirror at the\nother end of the room, and Constance waited long for her rejoinder.\nWhen it came it was rather irrelevant.\n\n\"I've heard of people who could read your thoughts better than you\ncould think them,\" she said; and Connie was too sleepy to strike back.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nFOR a week after the arrival of his visitors, Bartrow had scant\ntime and less inclination for troublement about such purely mundane\naffairs as the driving of tunnels and the incidental acquisition of\nwealth thereby. There were burro journeys to the top of the pass, and\nto the sheer cliff known to the prosaic frontiersmen as the devil's\njumping-off-place; excursions afoot down the mountain to the cool\ndepths of Chipeta Canyon, and to Silver Lake beyond the shrugged\nshoulder of Lost Creek Mountain; and finally there was a breath-cutting\nclimb to the snow-patched summit of El Reposo, undertaken for the\nexpress purpose of enabling Myra Van Vetter to say that she had been\nwhere there was reason to presume that no human being had preceded her.\n\nThese things three of them did, leaving Stephen Elliott to his own\ndevices, in accordance with the set terms upon which he had consented\nto father the _parti carr\u00c3\u00a9_. \"Go on and climb your mountains and just\nleave me out,\" he would say, when the preparations were making for the\nday's jaunt. \"I've had my share of it, off and on, while I was hunting\nfor something I hadn't lost. Dick, here, hasn't any better sense than\nto humor you; but you'd tramp mighty little if I had to go along.\"\n\nWhereupon he would plant his chair for the day upon the slab-floored\nporch of the cabin, tilt it to a comfortable angle against the wall,\nand while away the hours smoking a mellow pipe and reading the day-old\nDenver paper painstakingly, from the top of the title page to the\nbottom of the last want column.\n\nThus the crystalline autumn days winged their flight, and Bartrow\nsquired the two young women hither and yon, and finally to the top of\nEl Reposo, as recorded. This excursion was the climax, from a scenic\npoint of view; and Myra, having long since exhausted her vocabulary of\nsuperlatives, was unusually silent.\n\n\"What's come over you? are you gorged with mountains?\" queried Connie\nsympathetically, slipping her arm around her cousin's waist.\n\n\"It isn't that; it's just that I'm too full for utterance, I think;\nor perhaps I should say too empty of words to do it justice. How\nflippantly trivial everything human seems in the face of such a\nlandscape! Here are we, three inconsequent atoms, standing brazenly\nin the face of great nature, and trying to gather some notion of the\ninfinite into our finite little souls. It's sheer impertinence.\"\n\n\"They won't mind,\" rejoined Bartrow, with a comprehensive gesture,\nmeant to include the mountains, singular and collective; \"they're used\nto it--the impertinence, I mean. What you see is the face of nature,\nas you say, and man doesn't seem to be in it. Just the same, there is\na small army of men scattered among these overgrown hills, each with\nan inquisitive pick and shovel, backed by hardihood enough to dare\nanything for the sake of adding something to the wealth of the world.\"\n\nMyra turned her back on the prospect and searched Bartrow's eyes in\na way to make him wonder what was wrong with his well-turned little\nspeech.\n\n\"That is the first insincere thing I ever heard you say,\" she asserted.\n\"As if you didn't know that not one of these men ever wastes a second\nthought upon the world or the people in it, or upon anything outside of\nhis own little circle of ambitions and cravings!\"\n\n\"You're quite right,\" admitted Bartrow, abashed and more than willing\nto stand corrected in any field entered by Miss Van Vetter; but\nConstance took up the cudgels on the other side.\n\n\"You make me exceedingly weary, you two,\" she said, with seraphic\nsweetness. \"Neither of you knows what you are talking about half the\ntime, and when you do, it isn't worth telling. Now listen to me while\nI show you how ridiculous you are,\"--Bartrow sat down on a flat-topped\nboulder, and made a dumb show of stopping his ears,--\"I contend that\nnearly every one of these poor prospectors you've been maligning is\na perfect monument of unselfishness. He is working and starving and\nhoping and enduring for somebody else in nine cases out of ten. It's a\nwife, or a family, or an old father or mother, or the mortgage on the\nfarm, or some other good thing.\"\n\nMyra made a snowball and threw it at Connie the eloquent. \"I think El\nReposo is misnamed,\" she contended. \"It ought to be called the Mount of\nPerversity. Mr. Bartrow, you are sitting upon the table, which is very\nundignified. Please move and let us see what Wun Ling has stowed away\nin the haversack.\"\n\nThey spread their luncheon on the flat-topped boulder, and fell upon it\nlike the hungry wayfarers that they were, calling it a sky banquet, and\ndrinking Wun Ling's health in a bottle of cold tea. With satiety came\nthoughts of the descent, and Myra pleaded piteously for a change of\nroute.\n\n\"I shall never get down the way we came up in the wide, wide\nworld,--not alive,\" she asserted. \"With the view in prospect, I believe\nI could climb the Matterhorn; but getting down is quite another matter.\nCan't we go around some other way?\"\n\nBartrow thought it possible; but since Miss Van Vetter had particularly\ndesired to stand upon the summit of a hitherto unexplored peak, he was\nnot sure.\n\n\"But we can try,\" said Myra. \"At the worst we can come back and creep\ndown the way we came up.\"\n\nBartrow glanced at his watch, and focused the field-glass on a\ndiaphanous cloud slipping stealthily across the serrated summits of the\nmain range away to the westward.\n\n\"Yes, we can do that, if we have time,\" he assented. \"But I'm a little\nafraid of the weather. That cloud may miss us by twenty miles; and\nthen again, it may take a straight shoot across the valley and make us\nvery wet and uncomfortable.\"\n\nConstance came to the rescue with a compromise.\n\n\"You go and prospect for a new trail, Dick, and we'll stay here. If you\nfind one you can come back for us, and if you don't we'll be fresh for\nthe scramble down the other way.\"\n\nBartrow said it was well, and immediately set about putting the\nsuggestion into effect. When he was fairly out of sight over the\ncurvature of El Reposo's mighty shoulder, Myra said:--\n\n\"He's good, isn't he?\"\n\n\"He is a man among men, Myra; a man to tie to, as we say here in\nColorado.\"\n\nThey were sitting together on the flat boulder, and Miss Van Vetter\nstole a side glance at her cousin's profile. \"You have known him a long\ntime, haven't you, Connie?\"\n\n\"Almost ever since I can remember. I'm Colorado-born, you know, and he\nisn't; but he came across the plains in the days of the ox-teams, when\nhe was a little fellow, and the first work he ever did was for poppa,\nwhen we lived on the ranch below Golden.\"\n\n\"He is a self-made man, isn't he?\"\n\n\"Don't say that, Myra, please. I hate the word. God makes us, and\ncircumstances or our own foolishness mar us. But Dick is self-educated,\nso far as he is educated at all. He was a homeless waif when he first\nsaw the Rockies. His father died in the middle of the trip across the\nplains, and his mother lived only long enough to have her grave dug\nsome two hundred miles farther west. The others took care of Dick and\nbrought him along with them to Colorado because there wasn't anything\nelse to do; and since, Dick has made his own way, doing any honest\nthing that came to his hand.\"\n\n\"He couldn't do the other kind,\" Myra averred. \"But you spoke of\nhis education as if he hadn't any. I suppose that was one of your\n'exuberances,' as Uncle Stephen calls them. Mr. Bartrow is certainly\nanything but illiterate.\"\n\n\"No, he isn't that, though he has no education of the kind you effete\npeople have in mind when you spell the word with a capital--the kind\nwith a Greek-letter-badge and college-yell attachment. If you should\ntell him you had been to Bryn Mawr, he would probably take it to be\nsome summer resort he hadn't heard of. But that isn't saying he is\nstupid. He could give the man with the yell a lot of information on a\ngood many subjects. Poppa says he was always an earnest little lad;\nalways reading everything he could get hold of--which wasn't very much\nin the early days, as you may imagine.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, he seems to be getting on in the world,\" said Miss Van\nVetter. \"Your father says the Little Myriad is a promising mine.\"\n\nThere was more pathos than mirth in the smile which flitted across\nConnie's face.\n\n\"You're new among us yet, Myra. Everything with mineral in it is\npromising to us; we are cranks pure and simple, on that subject. The\nLittle Myriad is promising, of course,--there isn't an unpromising mine\nin the State, for that matter,--but it's only a promise, as yet. If\nDick should reach the end of his hundred and fifty feet of development\nwithout striking pay, he would be a ruined man.\"\n\n\"Why couldn't he keep on until he should strike it?\"\n\n\"For the very simple reason that he is working on borrowed capital; and\nI happen to know that he has borrowed about all he can.\"\n\n\"But he believes in the success of the venture, absolutely.\"\n\n\"Of course he does; that is one of the conditions. It's merely a\nquestion of credit with him. If any one would lend, Dick would go on\nborrowing and digging until he struck pay-ore or came out on the other\nside of the mountain--and then he'd think he hadn't gone deep enough.\nThat is the pathetic side of his character; he never knows when he's\nbeaten.\"\n\n\"I should call it the heroic side.\"\n\n\"It is heroic, but it is pathetic, too. It is sure to bring him\ntrouble, sooner or later, and Dick isn't one to take trouble lightly.\nHe'll go on fighting and struggling long after the battle has become\nhopeless, and that makes the sting of defeat so much sharper. It makes\nme want to cry when I think what a terrible thing it would be for him\nif the Little Myriad should go back on its promise.\"\n\nMiss Van Vetter took the field-glass and stood up to watch the storm\ncloud which was now spreading gradually and creeping slowly down the\nslopes of the divide. \"You think a great deal of Mr. Bartrow, don't\nyou, Connie?\"\n\n\"Indeed I do; he comes next to poppa with me.\"\n\nFor so long a time as one might take in saying a little prayer at a\nneedful crisis, Myra gave her undivided attention to the fleecy blur\nslipping down the side of the main range. Then the strain on her eyes\nfilled them with tears, and she put the glass back into its case.\nConstance saw the tears.\n\n\"Why, Myra! you're crying. What is the matter?\"\n\n\"I'm lonesome and homesick, and I long for the flesh-pots of Denver;\nbut it was the glass that made me cry. Connie, dear, don't you think\nwe'd better be going back to town?\"\n\n\"Why, yes; if you are quite ready. But it will be a disappointment for\nDick. He is counting on another week, at least.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know; and that is why I think we ought to go. We are keeping\nhim from his work in the mine, and his time is precious.\"\n\n\"Rather more so than he gives us to understand, I fancy,\" Constance\nassented. \"I suppose you are right, Myra,--we ought not to stay; but\nyou'll have to tax your ingenuity to find an excuse that will hold\nwater. Dick won't be satisfied with a P. P. C. card.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the chapter of accidents will help us. If it doesn't, you must\nmake your father remember that he has urgent business in Denver which\nwon't wait. Can't you manage it that way?\"\n\n\"If I can't, I'll ring you in. Poppa would take passage for Honolulu\nto-morrow if he had an idea that you'd like to see the Kanakas ride\nsurf-boards.\"\n\n\"I should much rather not appear in it,\" said Myra; and then, with\ntruly feminine inconsistency, \"I don't know why I say that. On the\nwhole, perhaps you'd better say that it's my proposal. Then Mr. Bartrow\nwill set it down to the vagaries of a flighty migrant, and he won't\nhold spite against his old friends.\"\n\nConnie the wise began to wonder if there were unplumbed depths in her\ncousin,--depths which Bartrow's defenseless obviousness had stirred to\nhis sparing; but she drove the thought out as unworthy. Myra had been\nkind to Dick, certainly, but she had never encouraged him. There might\nwell be an accepted lover in the dim Philadelphia background for aught\nMyra had said or done to evince the contrary. In which case--Connie the\nwise became Connie the pitiful in the turning of a leaf--poor Dick! At\nthat moment, as if the sympathetic thought had evoked him, Bartrow came\nin sight on the lower slope of the summit. He was breathing hard when\nhe reached them.\n\n\"We can make it all right,\" he said, slinging the glass and the\nhaversack, \"but it'll add three or four miles. It's a roundabout way,\nand it will take us into the head of Little Myriad Gulch. If you're\nready we'll get a quick move. That storm is heading straight for us,\nand we'll be in luck if we don't come in for a soaking.\"\n\nEl Reposo is a bald mountain, and its tonsure is fringed with a heavy\nforest growth which stops abruptly at timber-line. Halfway to the head\nof the gulch the new trail ended in a tangle of fallen trees,--the\nd\u00c3\u00a9bris of an ancient snowslide,--and much valuable time was lost in\nskirting the obstacle. Bartrow glanced over his shoulder from time to\ntime, and finally said, \"There it comes, with a vengeance!\"\n\nThe exclamation was ill-timed. Myra turned and stopped to watch the\nfleecy curtain of vapor shrouding the great bald summit they had just\nquitted. Bartrow sought to possess his soul in patience.\n\n\"Isn't it grand!\" she said, with kindling enthusiasm.\n\n\"Yes; grand and wet. If you'll excuse me, Miss Myra, I think we'd\nbetter run for it.\"\n\nThey ran for it accordingly, Connie in the lead like the free-limbed\ndaughter of the altitudes that she was, and Bartrow and Miss Van Vetter\nhand in hand like joyous children for whom self-consciousness is not.\nFrom the beginning of the wild race down the slopes the wetting seemed\nmomentarily imminent; none the less, they managed to reach the gulch\ndryshod. Inasmuch as their course down the ravine was in a direction\nnearly opposite to the sweep of the wind, it soon took them beyond the\nstorm zone, and they stopped to listen to the echoes of nature's battle\nreverberating from the crags of the higher levels. The writhing of\nthe great firs in the grasp of the wind came to their ears like the\nclashing of miniature breakers on a tideless shore; and the booming of\nthe thunder was minified by the rare atmosphere into a sound not unlike\nthe distant firing of cannon. While they paused, Myra climbed to the\ntop of a water-worn boulder in the bed of the ravine to get a better\npoint of view, and from this elevation she could see the forest at the\nhead of the gulch.\n\n\"Oh, Connie!\" she cried, \"climb up here, quick! It's a cyclone!\"\n\nBartrow threw up his head like a startled animal. There was a steady\nroar in the air which was not of the thunder.\n\n\"Cyclone nothing!\" he yelled. \"It's a cloud-burst! Stay where you are,\nfor your life, Miss Myra!\"\n\nEven as he spoke the roar deepened until the vibration of it shook the\nsolid earth, and a dark mass of water, turbid and d\u00c3\u00a9bris-laden, shot\nfrom the head of the gulch and swept down the ravine. Bartrow lived an\nanguished lifetime in an instant of hesitation. To save the woman he\nloved was to sacrifice Constance. To help Connie first was to take the\ndesperate chance that Myra would be safe till he could reach her.\n\nThere was no time for the nice weighing of possibilities; and Richard\nBartrow was a man of action before all else. Winding an arm about\nConstance, he dashed out of the ravine with her, getting back to Myra\nthree seconds in advance of the boulder-laden flood. There was time\nenough, but none to spare. A tree gave him an anchorage on the bank\nabove her; she sprang toward him at the word of command; and he plucked\nher up out of the reach of the foaming torrent which snapped at her and\noverturned the great rock upon which she had been standing.\n\nAfter which narrow escape they sat together on the slope of safety and\nwatched the subsiding flood, laughing over the \"stampede,\" as Connie\ncalled it, with all the reckless hardihood of youth and good spirits.\n\n\"I wouldn't have missed seeing it for anything in the world,\" declared\nthe enthusiast. \"I had plenty of time to get out of the way, but I\ncouldn't help waiting to see how it would look, coming over that last\ncliff up there.\"\n\n\"Dick didn't give me a chance to see anything,\" Connie complained. \"He\nwhisked me out of the way as if I'd been a naughty little girl caught\nplaying with the fire.\"\n\nBartrow examined the field-glass to see if it had suffered in the\nscramble. It was unbroken, and he put it back into the case with a sigh\nof relief.\n\n\"If you two had smashed that glass between you, I don't know what I\nshould have done,\" he said; whereat they all laughed again and took up\nthe line of march for the mine.\n\nThat evening, after supper, the four of them were on the porch of the\nthree-roomed cabin, enjoying the sunset. Constance had spoken to her\nfather about the return to Denver, and Stephen Elliott was racking his\nbrain for some excuse reasonable enough to satisfy Bartrow, when a man\ncame up the trail from the direction of Alta Vista. It was Bryant,\nthe station agent; and he was the bearer of a telegram addressed to\nConstance. She read it and gave it to Bartrow. The operator had taken\nit literally, and it was a small study in phonetics.\n\n    \"Shees gaun an got inter trubbel. P. Grims swipt her\n    masheen. Wot shel I do.\n\n                                             \"T. REAGAN.\"\n\nBartrow smiled and handed the message back. \"That's Tommie, I take it.\nWhat's it about?\"\n\n\"It's a young woman I've been trying to help. They are persecuting her\nagain, and I'll have to go back as quickly as I can.\"\n\n\"That's bad,\" said Bartrow; but Connie's father looked greatly\nrelieved, and, filling his pipe, began to burn incense to the kindly\ngod of chance.\n\nAfter a time, Bartrow asked, \"When?\"\n\nConnie's gaze was on the sunset, but her thoughts were miles away in a\nhumble cottage in West Denver where she had thought Margaret would be\nsafely hidden from the spoiler.\n\n\"I think we'd better go now--to-night. You can flag the train at the\nmine switch, can't you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you can get ready, can't you, Myra?\"\n\n\"Certainly; it won't take me long to pack. If you'll excuse me I'll go\nand do it now, and get it off my mind.\"\n\nWhen Myra had gone in, Bartrow took the message and read it again.\n\"This is no woman's job,\" he objected. \"Let me go down with you and\nstraighten it out.\"\n\n\"No, you mustn't, Dick; you have lost a clear week as it is.\"\n\nShe rose and went to the end of the porch, whither he presently\nfollowed her. \"You'll need a man,\" he insisted.\n\n\"I shall have poppa.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he's no good--only to pay the bills.\"\n\n\"No matter; I shall get along all right.\"\n\n\"That's straight, is it?\"\n\n\"Yes, I mean it.\"\n\n\"All right; you're the doctor. But you must wire me if you need me.\"\n\nAn hour later the visitors had said good-by to Bartrow and the Little\nMyriad, and were on their way down the canyon in the miniature\nsleeping-car. Myra pleaded weariness and had her berth made down early.\nNevertheless, she lay awake far into the night gazing out at the\nrotating heavens and the silent procession of peaks and precipices.\nFor a background the shifting scene held two irrelevant pictures; one,\nfreshly etched, reproducing the little drama of the cloud-burst; the\nother a memory of something she had read,--a story in which a man,\ntwo women, an overturned boat, and a storm-lashed lake figured as the\npersons and properties.\n\n\"He knew which he loved--which to save first--when the crux came,\" she\nsaid softly to her pillow, \"and the other girl was fortunate not to\nhave drowned.\" And at that moment a certain well-to-do gentleman of\nmiddle age in a far-away city on the Atlantic seaboard was nearer the\ngoal of his wishes than he had ever been before.\n\nIn the mean time, Bartrow had an inspiration which was importunate\nenough to send him afoot to Alta Vista in the wake of the swinging\npassenger train. It found voice in a mandatory telegram to Lansdale,\ntelling him to call at once upon Miss Constance Elliott, to present the\nmessage as his credential, and to place himself at her service in any\nrequired capacity, from man-at-arms to attorney-at-law.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nIN his westward sweep over the Titanic playground of farther Colorado,\nthe sun looks down into a narrow valley through which tumbles a\nbrawling stream whose waters, snow-born within rifle-shot, go to\nswell the canyoned flood of the Gunnison River. Fir-clad mountains,\nsombre green to timber-line and fallow dun or dazzling white above\nit, according to the season, stand like a cordon of mighty sentinels\naround and about; and the foot of civilized man treading the sward of\nthe park-like valley must first have measured many weary miles of the\nmountain wilderness.\n\nNotwithstanding its apparent inaccessibility, and its remoteness from\nany hoof-worn trail, the valley had once been inhabited. The evidences\nwere a rude log cabin, with its slab door hanging by a single leathern\nhinge, buttressing a weathered cliff on the western bank of the stream;\nand, in the opposing mountain slope, a timbered opening bearded with a\ngray dump of d\u00c3\u00a9bris, marking the entrance to a prospect tunnel.\n\nCabin and tunnel were both the handiwork of James Garvin. On one of his\nmany prospecting tours he had penetrated to the shut-in valley; and\nfinding a promise of mineral deposits in the slopes of the sentinel\nmountains, had gone into permanent camp and driven the prospect tunnel\ninto the rocky hillside. When he had done something more than the\ndevelopment work necessary to hold the claim, two things conspired\nto drive him forth of the valley. His provisions ran low; and the\nindications in the tunnel, which had pointed to a silver-bearing lode\nof graphic tellurium, changed suddenly at a \"dike\" in the strata, and\ndisappeared altogether.\n\nGarvin was a stubborn man, and the toxin of the prospector's fever was\nin his blood. Wherefore he put himself upon siege rations and delved\nagainst time. When he had baked his last skillet of panbread and\nfired his last charge of dynamite in the heading, the dike was still\nunpenetrated. After that, there was nothing for it but retreat; and he\nreluctantly broke camp and left the valley, meaning to return when he\ncould.\n\nTwo years elapsed and the opportunity still tarried; but Garvin kept\nthe shut-in valley in mind, and it was thitherward he turned his face\nwhen Stephen Elliott's liberal \"grub-stake,\" and the hastily formed\npartnership with Jeffard, provided the means and the help necessary to\nsink a shaft.\n\nIt was in the afternoon of a cloudless August day that Jeffard had his\nfirst glimpse of the park-like valley lying in the lap of the sentinel\nmountains. The air was crisp and thin-edged with the keen breath of the\naltitudes, but the untempered heat of the sun beat pitilessly upon the\nheads of the two men picking their laborious way over the rock-ribbed\nshoulder of the least precipitous mountain.\n\n\"Well, pardner, we've riz the last o' the hills,\" quoth Garvin,\nstepping aside to let the burro, with its jangling burden of camp\nutensils and provisions, precede him. \"How d'you stack up by this time?\"\n\nJeffard's tongue clave to the roof of his mouth. Frantic plunges into\nthe nether depths are not conducive to good health, moral or physical,\nand nature was exacting the inevitable penalty. For three days he had\nbeen fighting a losing battle with an augmenting army of ills, and\nbut for the rough heartening of his companion he would have fallen by\nthe wayside more than once during the breath-cutting march over the\nmountain passes. Wherefore his answer to Garvin's question was the\nbabblement of despair.\n\n\"I'm a dead man, Garvin. You'll only have me to bury if you persist in\ndragging me any farther. I'm done, I tell you.\"\n\nGarvin stroked his stubbly chin and hid his concern under a ferocious\nscowl.\n\n\"No, you ain't done, not by a long shot. You needn't to think I'm goin'\nto let you play off on me that-a-way--with the promised land cuddlin'\ndown yonder in that gulch a-waitin' for us. Not much, Mary Ann. You're\ngoin' to twist the crank o' that there win'lass a-many a time afore you\nget shut o' me.\"\n\nThe burro wagged one ear and sat upon its haunches preparatory to\na perilous slide down a steep place in the trail. Garvin saved the\npack by darting forward and anchoring both beast and burden by main\nstrength. While the big man was wrestling with the burro, Jeffard\nstumbled and fell, rose wavering to his knees and fell again, this time\nwith his teeth set to stifle a groan. Garvin threw the pack-animal with\ndexterous twitch of its foreleg, and hoppled it with a turn of the\nlariat before going back to Jeffard.\n\n\"Now then, up you come,\" he said, trying to stand Jeffard upon his\nfeet; but the sick man collapsed inertly and sank down again.\n\n\"Let me alone,\" he enjoined, in a sudden transport of feeble\ntruculence. \"I told you I was done, and I am. Can't you go about your\nbusiness and leave a man to die in peace?\"\n\n\"Oh, you be damned,\" retorted Garvin cheerfully. \"All you need is a\nlittle more sand. Get up and mog along now, 'fore I run shy o' patience\nand thump the everlastin' daylights out o' you.\" And he stooped again\nand slipped his arm under Jeffard's shoulders.\n\nThe sick man's head rocked from side to side. \"Don't,\" he groaned,\nthis time in gentler protest. \"I'd do it if I could--if only for your\nsake. But it isn't in me; I've been dying on my feet for the last three\nhours. I couldn't drag myself another step if the gates of Heaven stood\nopen down yonder and all hell were yapping at my heels. Go on and leave\nme to fight it out. You can come back to-morrow and cover up what the\nbuzzards have left.\"\n\nGarvin straightened up and drew the back of his hand across his eyes.\n\n\"Listen at him!\" he broke out, in a fine frenzy of simulated rage.\n\"Just listen at the fool idjit talk, will you? And me standin' over him\na-pleadin' like a suckin' dove! By crucifer! if it wasn't for throwin'\naway good ammynition, I'd plug him one just for his impidence--blame my\nskin if I wouldn't!\" And being frugal of his cartridges, Garvin flung\nhimself upon the prostrate burro, dragged it to its feet, cast the\njangling burden, pack-saddle and all, and lifted Jeffard astride of the\ndiminutive mount.\n\n\"There you are,\" he said, with gruff tenderness. \"Now then, just lop\nyour head on my shoulder and lay back ag'inst my arm, and play you\nwas a-coastin' down the hill back o' the old schoolhouse on a greazed\nstreak o' lightnin', with your big brother a-holdin' you on. We'll make\nit pretty middlin' quick, now, if the canary don't peg out.\" And thus\nthey made entrance into the shut-in valley, and won across it to the\nlog cabin whose door hung slantwise by the single hinge.\n\nThen and there began a grim fight for the life of a man, with an\nuntutored son of the solitudes, lacking everything but the will to do,\npitted against a fierce attack of mountain fever which was aided and\nabetted by the devitalizing effects of Jeffard's hard apprenticeship\nto evil. In the end the indomitable will of the nurse, rather than\nany conscious effort on the part of the patient, won the battle.\nGarvin cursed his luck and swore pathetically as day after day of the\nshort mountain summer came and went unmarked by any pick-blow on the\nslopes of the mountains of promise; but his care of the sick man was\nunremitting, and he was brutally tender and wrathfully soft-hearted by\nturns until Jeffard was well beyond the danger line.\n\nIt was a lambent evening in the final week of August when Garvin\ncarried the fever-wasted convalescent to the door of the cabin and\npropped him in a rustic chair builded for the occasion.\n\n\"How's that?\" he demanded, standing back to get the general effect of\nman and chair. \"Ain't I a jack-leg carpenter, all right? Now you just\nbrace up and swaller all the outdoors you can hold while I smoke me a\npipe.\"\n\nHe sat down on the doorstep and filled and lighted his pipe. After a\nfew deep-drawn whiffs, he said, \"Don't tire you none to be a-settin'\nup, does it?\"\n\n\"No.\" Jeffard turned slowly and sniffed the pungent fragrance of the\nburning tobacco with a vague return of the old craving. \"Have you\nanother pipe?\" he queried. \"I believe I'd enjoy a whiff or two with\nyou.\"\n\n\"Now just listen at that, will you?\" Garvin growled, masking his joy\nunder a transparent affectation of disgust. \"Me takin' care of him like\nhe was a new-borned baby, and him a-settin' there, cool as a blizzard,\naskin' for a pipe! If I wasn't a bloomin' angel, just waitin' for my\nwings to sprout, I'd tell him to go to blazes, that's about what I'd\ndo.\"\n\nNone the less, he went in and found a clean corncob, filling it and\ngiving it to Jeffard with a lighted match. The convalescent smoked\ntentatively for a few minutes, pausing longer between the whiffs until\nthe fire and the tobacco-hunger died out together. After which he said\nwhat was in his mind.\n\n\"Garvin, old man, you must begin work to-morrow,\" he began. \"I can take\ncare of myself now, and in a few days I hope I'll be able to take hold\nwith you. You've lost too much time tinkering with me. I'm not worth\nit.\"\n\n\"We'll find out about that when we get you on to the crank o' that\nwin'lass,\" said Garvin sententiously. \"Man's a good deal like a\nhorse,--vallyble accordin' to location. They tell me that back in God's\ncountry, where I was raised, horses ain't worth their winter keep since\nthe 'lectric cars come in; but out yere I've seen the time when a\nno-account, gristly little bronco, three parts wire and five parts pure\ncussedness, 'u'd a-been worth his weight in bullion.\"\n\nJeffard picked the application out of the parable, and smiled.\n\n\"You've got your bronco,\" he asserted. \"When you're a little better\nacquainted with me you'll find your definition isn't far wrong. I used\nto think I was a halfway decent sort of fellow, Garvin, but I believe\nthe last few months have flailed all the whole wheat out of me, leaving\nnothing but the musty chaff.\"\n\n\"Oh, you be hanged!\" laughed Garvin, with the emphasis heartening.\n\"You're off your feed a few lines yet and your blood needs thickenin',\nthat's all. I'll risk but what you'll assay up to grade in the\nmill-run.\"\n\nSilence came and sat between them for a little space, holding its own\nuntil Jeffard's eye lighted upon the d\u00c3\u00a9bris-bearded tunnel-opening in\nthe opposite hillside.\n\n\"What is that?\" he asked, pointing the query with an emaciated finger.\n\n\"That's my old back number that I was tellin' you about on the way in,\"\nGarvin explained. \"I thought I'd struck a lead o' tellurides up there,\nsure, but it petered out on me.\"\n\n\"When was that?\" Jeffard's recollection of all things connected with\nthe fever-haunted jornada across the ranges was misty and fragmentary.\n\n\"Two year ago this summer,\" rejoined the miner; and filling his pipe\nafresh he retold the story of his earlier visit to the valley.\n\n\"It's a dead horse,\" he added, by way of conclusion. \"I ought to knowed\nbetter. I'm old enough at the business to savvy tellurides when I see\n'em, and that lead never did look right from the start.\"\n\n\"Did you ever locate it?\" asked Jeffard.\n\n\"Not much! I never got any furder along that-a-way than to stake it off\nand make a map of it.\" Garvin found a pack of thumbed and grimy papers\nin his pocket and worked his way through it till he came upon the map.\n\"You're an engineer,\" he said: \"how's that for a jack-leg entry map?\"\n\nJeffard examined the rude sketch and pronounced it good enough; after\nwhich he folded the paper absently and put it in his pocket. Garvin did\nnot notice his failure to return it,--if, indeed, he thought or cared\nanything further about it,--and went on talking of his own unwisdom in\ndriving a tunnel on a lode which did not \"look right.\"\n\n\"We'll know better, this trip,\" he asserted, as somewhat of a salve to\nthe former hurt. \"We'll go higher up the gulch and sink a shaft; that's\nabout what we'll do.\"\n\nAnd this, in the fullness of time, was what they did. After a few days,\nJeffard was able to inch his way by easy stages to the new location;\nand by the time Garvin had dug and blasted himself into a square pit\nwindlass-deep, the convalescent was strong enough to take his place at\nthe hoist.\n\nFrom the very first, Jeffard was totally unable to share Garvin's\nenthusiastic faith in the possibilities of the new cast for fortune.\nIgnorant of the first principles of practical metal-digging, he was,\nnone the less, a fairly good laboratory metallurgist; while Garvin, on\nthe other hand, knew naught of man's, but much of nature's, book. Hence\nthere arose many discussions over the possibilities; Jeffard contending\nthat the silver-bearing lodes of the valley were not rich enough to\nbear pack-train transportation to the nearest railway point; and Garvin\nclinging tenaciously to the prospectors' theory that a \"true-fissure\"\nvein must of necessity prove a very Golconda once you had gone deep\nenough into its storehouse.\n\nWhen all was said, the man of the laboratory won a barren victory. At\nthirty feet the lode in the shaft had dwindled to a few knife-blade\nseams, and the last shot fired in the bottom of the excavation put an\nend to the work of exploitation by letting in a flood of water. Since\nthey had no means of draining the shaft so suddenly transformed into\na well, Garvin gave over, perforce, but proposed trying their luck\nelsewhere in the valley before seeking a new field. Jeffard acquiesced,\nwith the suggestion that they save time by prospecting in different\ndirections; and this they did, Garvin taking the upper half of the\nvalley and Jeffard the lower. At the end of a week, Jeffard gave up\nin disgust; and when his companion begged for yet one other day, was\nminded to stay in camp and invite his soul in idleness until the\npersevering one should be convinced.\n\nAs a matter of course, Garvin's day multiplied itself by three, and\nJeffard wore out the interval as best he might, tramping the hillsides\nin the vicinity of the cabin to kill time, and smoking uncounted pipes\non the doorstep in the cool of the day while waiting for Garvin's\nreturn.\n\nIt was in the pipe-smoking interregnum of the third day that the\nabandoned tunnel in the opposite hillside beckoned to him. Oddly\nenough, he thought, Garvin had never referred to it since the retelling\nof its history in the reminiscent pauses of their first outdoor\nevening together. Jeffard's eye measured the dump appraisively. It was\na monument to the heroic perseverance of the solitary prospector.\n\n\"That hole must be thirty or forty feet into the hill,\" he mused. \"And\nto think of his worrying it out alone!\" Here idle curiosity nudged\nhim with its blunt elbow, and he rose and knocked the ashes from his\npipe. \"I believe I'll go up and have a look at it. It'll kill another\nhalf-hour or so, and they're beginning to die rather hard.\"\n\nHe crossed the stream on Garvin's ancient foot-log, and clambered\nleisurely to the toe of the dump. The snows of two winters had washed\nthe detritus free of soil, and Jeffard bent, hand on knee, to look for\nspecimens of the ore-bearing rock.\n\n\"Gangue-rock, most of it, with a sprinkling of decomposed quartz along\nat the last,\" he said reflectively. \"The quartz was the dike he struck,\nI suppose. He was wise to give it up. There's no silver in that stuff.\"\n\nHe picked up a bit of the snuff-colored rock and crumbled it in\nhis hand. It was quite friable, like weathered sandstone, but when\nthe fragment was crushed the particles still clung together as if\nmatted with invisible threads. Jeffard was too new to the business\nof metal-hunting to suspect the tremendous significance of the small\nphenomenon, but he was sufficiently curious to gather a double handful\nof the fragments of quartz, meaning to ask Garvin if he had noticed the\npeculiarity. And when he had climbed to the tunnel and explored it to\nits rock-littered heading by the light of a sliver splintered from one\nof the pitchy logs of the timbering, he sauntered back to the cabin\nbeneath the western cliff and made a fire over which to prepare supper\nagainst Garvin's return.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nGARVIN came into camp late, and Jeffard needed not to ask the result\nof the day's quest. He had cooked the simple supper, and they ate it\ntogether in silence--the big man too weary and dejected to talk, and\nJeffard holding his peace in deference to Garvin's mood. Over the pipes\non the doorstep Jeffard permitted himself a single query.\n\n\"No go?\"\n\n\"Nary,\" was the laconic rejoinder.\n\nJeffard was the least demonstrative of men, but the occasion seemed to\nask for something more than sympathetic silence. So he said: \"It's hard\nluck; harder for you than for me, I imagine. Somehow, I haven't been\nable to catch the inspiration of the mineral-hunt; but you have, and\nyou've worked hard and earned a better send-off.\"\n\n\"Huh! far as earnin' goes, I reckon it's a stand-off 'twixt the two of\nus. You've certain'y done your share o' the pullin' and haulin', if you\nhave been sort o' like what the boys call a 'hoodoo.'\"\n\nJeffard blew a cloud of smoke toward the gray rock-beard hanging\nghostly beneath the black mouth of the excavation in the opposite\nhillside, and was far from taking offense. \"Meaning that I haven't been\nenthusiastic enough to fill the bill?\" he asked.\n\n\"I guess that's about it. And it always seemed sort o' cur'ous to me.\nMoney'd do you a mighty sight more good than it would me.\"\n\nJeffard smoked his pipe out, debating with himself whether it was worth\nwhile to try to explain his indifference to his companion. He did try,\nfinally, though more for the sake of putting the fact into words than\nin any hope of making it understandable to Garvin.\n\n\"I'm afraid it isn't in me to care very much about anything,\" he said,\nat the end of the reflective excursion. \"Six months ago I could have\ncome out here with you and given you points on enthusiasm; but since\nthen I've lived two or three lifetimes. I'm a very old man, Garvin. One\nday, not so very long ago, if you measure by weeks and months, I was\nyoung and strong and hopeful, like other men; but instead of burning\nthe candle decently at the proper end, I made a bonfire of it. The fire\nhas gone out now, and I haven't any other candle.\"\n\nThe big prospector was good-naturedly incredulous. \"You've had the\nfever, and you're rattled, yet; that's all that's the matter with you.\nYou've been flat down on your luck, like one or two of the rest of us;\nbut that ain't any reason why you can't get up ag'in, is it?\"\n\nJeffard despaired of making it clear to any simple-hearted son of the\nwilderness, but he must needs try again.\n\n\"That is your view of the case, and it would be that of others who\nknew the circumstances as well as you do. But it doesn't fit the\nindividual. David said he would wash his hands in innocency, and\nperhaps he could, and did--though I doubt it. I can't. When you picked\nme up that night on the shore of the pond, I'd been wandering around in\nthe bottomless pit and had lost my way. I knew then I shouldn't find it\nagain, and I haven't. I seem to have strayed into a region somewhere\nbeyond the place where the actual brimstone chokes you; but it's a\nbarren desert where nothing seems quite the same as it used to--where\nnothing is the same, as a matter of fact. Do I make it plain?\"\n\n\"You bet you don't,\" responded Garvin, out of the depths of cheerful\ndensity. \"You've been a mile or two out o' my reach for the last\nhalf-hour 'r so. Ther' ain't no use a-cryin' over spilt milk, is what I\nsay; and when I go kerflummix, why, I just cuss a few lines and get up\nand mog along, same as heretofore.\"\n\nJeffard laughed, but there was no mirth in him.\n\n\"I envy you; you are a lucky man to be able to do it. I wish in my soul\nI could.\"\n\n\"What's the reason you can't?\"\n\n\"That is precisely what I haven't been able to make you understand.\nBut the fact remains. The Henry Jeffard my mother knew is dead and\nburied. In his place has arisen a man who is acquainted with evil, and\nis skeptical about most other things. Garvin, if you knew me as well\nas I know myself, you'd run me out of this valley with a gun before\nyou slept. I owe you as heavy a debt of gratitude as any one man ever\nowed another, and yet if your welfare stood between the beginning and\nthe end of some devil's service in which I might be commissioned, you\nwouldn't be safe to sleep in the same cabin with me.\"\n\n\"Oh, you be damned,\" said the big man, relapsing into a deeper depth of\nincredulity. \"You've got a devil 'r two, all right, maybe, but they're\nthe blue kind, and they'll soak out in the washin'. Fact o' the matter\nis, our cussed luck in this yere hole in the ground has struck in on\nyou worse'n it has on me. You'll be all right when we get some place\nelse and strike it rich.\"\n\nJeffard refilled his pipe and gave over trying to define himself in\nset terms. When next he broke silence it was to speak of the impending\nmigration.\n\n\"I suppose we pull out in the morning?\" he said.\n\n\"Might as well. We've played the string out up yere. Besides, summer's\ngone, and a month of fall, and the grub's runnin' shy.\"\n\n\"Where next?\" inquired Jeffard.\n\n\"I dunno, hardly. 'Tain't worth while to strike furder in, this late in\nthe season. We've got to be makin' tracks along back t'wards the valley\nafore the snow comes, and that'll be pretty quick now. What d' you say\nto tryin' some o' the gulches o' the Mosquito?\"\n\n\"Anywhere you say. I'm with you--if you care to take me after what I've\ntried to tell you. But you'd much better go alone. You had it right a\nwhile ago; you have yoked yourself to a Jonah.\"\n\n\"Jonah nothin'!\" growled the soft-hearted giant. \"Nex' time I set\nout to devil you, I'll drill a hole aforehand and put in a pinch o'\ndannymite along with the joke. Then when I tech it off, you'll know.\"\n\nThe moon was riding high in the black arch of the sky, and the gray\ndump on the opposite mountain stood out in bold relief. Jeffard rose\nand leaned against the doorpost.\n\n\"Garvin, you have never yet told me who staked us for this trip,\" he\nsaid, broaching a subject which had more than once asked for speech.\n\nThe miner laughed. \"You never asked. It's the same old man that staked\nme when I was yere the first time.\"\n\n\"When you dug that hole up yonder in the hill?\"\n\n\"Um--hm.\"\n\n\"Who is he?\"\n\nGarvin hesitated. \"I had a fool notion I wouldn't tell you till we'd\nstruck somethin' worth while,\" he said finally. \"If so be we've got\nto go back with our fingers in our mouths, I put it up that maybe\nyou'd feel easier in your mind if you didn't know. You're so cussed\nthin-skinned about some things that a feller has to watch out for you\ncontinnyus.\"\n\nJeffard dug the kindly intention out of the upbraiding, and forebore to\npress the question. After all, what did it matter? Whatever befell, he\nwas under no obligations to any one save Garvin. And in the itemizing\nof that debt, an obligation which made him restive every time he\nthought of it, he lost sight of the question he had intended asking\nabout the peculiarity of the snuff-colored rock in the abandoned tunnel.\n\nA little later, Garvin got up with a mighty yawn, and said: \"If we're\ngoin' to get out o' here afore noon to-morrer, I reckon we'd better be\nhuntin' us a little sleep.\"\n\n\"Turn in if you like; I'm not sleepy yet,\" said Jeffard; and when\nGarvin was gone in, he fell to pacing up and down before the cabin door\nwith his hands behind him and the cold pipe between his teeth.\n\nTo what good end had he been preserved by Garvin's interference on\nthat night of despair two months before? Had the reprieve opened up\nany practicable way out of the cynical labyrinth into which he had\nwandered? Had his immense obligation to the prospector quickened any\nfibre of the dead sense of human responsibility, or lighted any fire of\ngenerous love for his kind?\n\nHe shook his head. To none of these questions could he honestly append\nan affirmative. In the desolate wreck he had made of his life no good\nthing had survived save his love for Constance Elliott. That, indeed,\nwas hopeless on the side of fruition; but he clung to it as the one\nclue of promise, hoping, and yet not daring to hope, that it might\none day lead him out of the wilderness of indifference. While he\ndwelt upon it, pacing back and forth in the moonlight, he recalled his\npicture of her standing in the dust-filtered afternoon sunlight, with\nthe dim corridor for a background.\n\n\"God keep you, my darling. I may not look upon your face again, but\nthe memory of your loving kindness to one soul-sick castaway will live\nwhile he lives.\"\n\nHe said it reverently, turning his face toward the far-away city\nbeyond the foot-hills; and there was no subtle sense of divination to\ntell him that, at an unmapped side-track on the farther slope of the\nsouthernmost sentinel mountain, Bartrow was at that moment handing\nConstance Elliott up the steps of a diminutive sleeping-car which was\npresently to go lurching and swaying on its way down the mountain in\nthe wake of a pygmy locomotive. Nor could he know that, a few hours\nearlier, the far-seeing gray eyes, out of whose depths he had once\ndrawn courage and inspiration and the will to do good, had rested for a\nmoment on the shut-in valley.\n\nFor the southward sentinel mountain was known to the dwellers on its\nfarther slopes as El Reposo.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nROBERT LANSDALE, literary starveling and doomed victim of an incurable\nmalady, was yet sufficiently unchastened to read Bartrow's telegram\nwith the nerves of reluctance sharp set. For what he persuaded himself\nwere good and defensible reasons, he had lived the life of an urban\nhermit in Denver, arguing that a poverty-smitten crumb-gatherer with\none foot in the grave might properly refuse to be other than an\nonlooker in any scene of the human comedy.\n\nThe prompting was not altogether unselfish. In common with other\ncraftsmen of his guild, Lansdale was blessed, or banned, with a moiety\nof the seer's gift. For him, as for all who can discern the masks and\ntrappings and the sham stage-properties, the world-comedy had become\npitifully tragic; and he was by nature compassionate and sympathetic.\nWherefore he spared himself the personal point of view, cultivating\nan aloofness which his few friends were prone to miscall cynicism and\nexclusiveness.\n\nLansdale knew Miss Elliott by repute, and he shrewdly suspected that\nshe knew all Bartrow could tell her about a certain literary pretender\nwho had once been rude enough to send apologies to a hostess who had\nnot invited him. None the less Bartrow was too good a friend to be\nignored in the day of his asking; and Lansdale presented himself at\nthe door of the house in Colfax Avenue at an unfashionably early hour,\nmeaning to begin by making the tender of his services as nearly a\nmatter of business as might be.\n\nIt was Connie herself who met him at the door and would hear no more\nthan his name until he was established in her father's easy-chair\nbefore the cheerful fire in the library. Her welcome was hospitably\ncordial; and Lansdale, who had fondly imagined embarrassment to\nbe one of the foibles most deeply buried under the d\u00c3\u00a9bris of the\ndisillusioning years, found himself struggling with an attack of\ntongue-tied abashment which is like to be the penalty exacted of any\nhermit who refuses to mix and mingle with his kind.\n\n\"I came to see you at the request of a friend of yours, and of\nmine, Miss Elliott,\" he began formally, fumbling in his pocket\nfor the telegram. \"I have a message from Mr. Richard Bartrow\nwhich--will--explain\"--\n\nThe search and the sentence raveled out together in the discovery that\nthe telegram which was to have been his introduction had been left on\nthe writing-table in his room. Connie saw consternation in his face and\nmade haste to help him.\n\n\"From Mr. Bartrow? We have just returned from a visit to his mine up in\nChaffee County. Did he forget something that he wanted to tell us, at\nthe last moment?\"\n\n\"Really, I--I can't say,\" stammered Lansdale, to whom the loss of the\ntelegram was the dragging of the last anchor of equanimity. \"It appears\nthat I was thoughtless enough to leave the telegram in my room. Will\nyou excuse me until I can go back and fetch it?\"\n\n\"Is it necessary?\" Connie queried. \"Can't you tell me what he says?\"\n\nLansdale pulled himself together and gave her the gist of Bartrow's\nmandate. Miss Elliott's laugh made him forget his embarrassment.\n\n\"That is just like Dick,\" she said. \"He offered to come down with us\nlast night, but I wouldn't let him. You know Mr. Bartrow quite well, do\nyou not?\"\n\n\"Very well, indeed.\"\n\n\"Then you know how anxious he always is to help his friends.\"\n\n\"No one has better cause to know; he is one of the finest fellows in\nthe world,\" Lansdale rejoined warmly.\n\n\"Thank you, for Dick's sake,\" said Connie; \"now we shall get on nicely.\nBut to go back a little: a young woman whom I have been trying to help\nis in some trouble, and Dick thought he might be needed. It was out of\nthe goodness of his heart. I really don't need any help--at least, not\nmore than my father's check-book can answer for.\"\n\n\"Are you quite sure? You must remember that I am Richard Bartrow's\nsubstitute, and make use of me accordingly. May I know the\ncircumstances?\"\n\nConstance related them, telling him Margaret Gannon's story as only\na sister of mercy could tell it; without extenuation or censure,\nand also without embarrassment. Lansdale listened absorbedly, with\nthe literary instinct dominant. It was Margaret Gannon's story, but\nConstance Elliott was the heroine; a heroine worthy the pen of a master\ncraftsman, he thought, while the creative part of him was busy with\nthe pulling and hauling and scene-shifting which the discovery of a\nHeaven-born central figure sets in motion. But in the midst of it the\nman got the better of the craftsman. He foresaw with sudden clarity of\ninsight that Miss Elliott would presently be of the inner circle of\nthose out of whom the most hardened votary of the pen cannot make copy;\nthose whose personality is sacred because it is no longer a thing apart\nto be dispassionately analyzed.\n\nWhen she made an end, he sat looking at her so intently and so long\nthat she grew nervous. The light in his eyes made her feel as if\nshe were focused under the object glass of a microscope. He saw the\nenthusiasm die out of her face and give place to discomposure, and made\neager apologies.\n\n\"Forgive me, Miss Elliott; I didn't mean to be rude. But I have never\nlooked upon your like before,--a woman in whom the quality of mercy is\nnot strained; whose charity is compassionate enough to reach out to the\nunfortunate of her own sex.\"\n\nConnie was too simple-hearted to be self-conscious under commendation.\n\n\"That is because your opportunities have been unkind, I fancy. A few\nyears ago your criticism would have been very just; but nowadays much\nof the rescue work is done by women, as it should be.\"\n\n\"Much of the organized work, yes. But your own story proves that it has\nnot become individualized.\"\n\n\"That may well be the fault of the advocate in Margaret's case,\"\nreturned Connie, whose charity was not circumscribed. \"If any one of\nthe many good women I have tried to enlist in this young woman's cause\nhad been the one to discover her, I should doubtless have the same\nstory to tell, and quite possibly with a better sequel. But now you\nunderstand why I don't need help. Tommie--he's my newsboy henchman, you\nknow--has been here this morning to make his report. It seems that when\nMargaret was taken sick she was in debt to this man Grim for costumes,\nor railway fare, or something, and he has taken her sewing-machine to\nsatisfy the claim.\"\n\nThe hectic flush in Lansdale's thin cheek began to define itself, with\na little pulse throbbing in the centre of it.\n\n\"He is an iniquitous scoundrel, and he ought to be prosecuted,\" he\ndeclared. \"Don't you see?--but of course you don't; you are too\ncharitable to suspect his real object, which is to drive the young\nwoman back into the service of his master, the devil. He had no more\nlegal right to take her sewing-machine than he would have to attach the\ntools of a mechanic. Is there any law in Colorado?\"\n\n\"Plenty of it,\" Connie rejoined; adding, with unconscious sarcasm, \"but\nI think it is chiefly concerned with disputes about mining claims.\"\n\n\"Let us hope there is a statute or two over and above, for the\nprotection of ordinary mortals,\" said Lansdale, rising and finding his\nhat. \"I presume you meant to buy Margaret another sewing-machine. You\nmustn't encourage buccaneering in any such way. Let me go and try my\npowers of persuasion on Mr. Peter Grim.\"\n\nBut Connie was not unmindful of what Bartrow had told them about\nLansdale's ill health, and she promptly disapproved.\n\n\"No, indeed, you mustn't, Mr. Lansdale; you mustn't think of doing any\nsuch thing. You don't know the man. He is a 'hold-over' desperado from\nthe stage-line days. Even Dick admits that he is a person to be feared\nand avoided. And, besides, you're not strong, you know.\"\n\nLansdale smiled down upon her from his gaunt height, and his heart\nwarmed to her in a way which was not to be accounted for by the simple\nrule of the humanities.\n\n\"Dick told you that, too, did he? I am sorry.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because it involves your sympathy, and sympathy is much too precious\nto be wasted upon such flotsam as I. But I am quite robust enough to\nsee justice done in this young woman's case. You must promise me not to\nmove in it until you hear from me.\"\n\nConnie promised and let him go. But in the stronger light of the hall\nshe saw how really ill he looked, and was remorsefully repentant, after\nher kind.\n\nLansdale left the house in Colfax Avenue with an unanalyzed sense of\nlevitation, which made him feel as though he were walking upon air;\nbut when he had accounted for the phenomenon he came to earth again\nwith disheartening celerity. What had a man in whose daily walk death\nwas a visible presence to do with the tumult of gladsome suggestion\nevoked by a few words of sympathy from a compassionate young woman with\na winsome face and innocent eyes? Nothing; clearly, nothing whatever.\nLansdale set his teeth upon the word, and drove the suggestion forth\nwith sudden bitterness. His part in the little drama growing out of\nMiss Elliott's deed of mercy was at best but that of a supernumerary.\nWhen he should have made his entrance and exit, he must go the way of\nother supernumeraries, and be presently forgotten of the real actors.\n\nSo ran the wise conclusion; but the event leagued itself with\nunwisdom, and the prudent forecasting gave place to the apparent\nnecessities. The preliminary interview with Grim was wholly abortive.\nThe man of vice not only refused point blank to make restitution,\nbut evinced a readiness to take the matter into the courts which was\nmost disconcerting to Margaret Gannon's moneyless advocate. Thereupon\nensued other visits to the house in Colfax Avenue, and a growing and\nconfidential intimacy with Constance, and the enlisting of Stephen\nElliott in the cause of justice, and many other things not prefigured\nin Lansdale's itinerary.\n\nAnd at the end of it all it was Stephen Elliott's check-book, and not\nan appeal to the majesty of the law, which rescued Margaret Gannon's\nsewing-machine; and the man of vice pocketed the amount of his\nextortionate claim, and gave a receipt in full therefor, biding his\ntime, and bidding an obsequious Son of Ahriman--the same whom Jeffard\nhad smitten aforetime--keep an eye on Margaret Gannon against the day\nwhen she should be sufficiently unbefriended to warrant a recasting of\nthe net.\n\nAnd when these things had come to pass, Robert Lansdale was of all\nmen the most miserable. From much dabbling in the trickling rill of\nfictional sentiment, he had come to disbelieve the existence of any\ndeep river of passion; but now he found himself upon the brink of\nsuch a river and was forbidden to plunge therein. Nay, more; he must\nturn away from it, parched and thirsty as any wayworn pilgrim of the\nworld-desert, without so much as lifting a palmful of its healing\nwaters to his lips.\n\nHe postponed the turning away from day to day, weakly promising himself\nthat each visit to the house in Colfax Avenue should be the last,\nand as weakly yielding when a day or two of abstinence had enhanced\nhis soul-hunger until it became a restless agony, mocking his most\nstrenuous effort to drown it in a sea of work.\n\nFailing himself utterly, he fell to watching Connie's face for some\ntoken of the hopelessness of his passion, telling himself that he\nshould find strength to stay away when he should read his sentence\nin the calm gray eyes. But Connie's eyes were as yet no more than\nfrankly sympathetic. And because he was far from home, and seemingly\nfriendless, and fighting the last grim battle with an incurable\nmalady, she made him welcome and yet more welcome, until finally, the\noptimistic insanity of the consumptive came upon him, assuring him that\nhe should live and not die, and pointing him hopefully down a dim vista\nof years,--a shining way wherein they two might walk hand in hand till\nthey should come to the gate of the House Beautiful whose chatelaine is\nFame.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nTHE line of retreat from the valley, called by Jeffard \"of dry bones,\"\nto the possible land of promise in the Mosquito, lay through Leadville;\nnot the teeming, ebullient, pandemoniac mining-camp of the early\ncarbonate era, but its less crowded, less effervescent, though no less\nstrenuous successor of the present.\n\nOn the march across the sky-pitched mountains it had been agreed\nbetween them that there should be one bivouac in the city of the bleak\naltitudes. That is to say, Garvin proposed it, and Jeffard assented,\nthough not without a premonition that the halt would be fatal to the\nproposed Mosquito sequel to the campaign in the Saguache. He knew at\nleast one of Garvin's weaknesses, and that it was akin to his own.\nThere were the beast of burden and the dispensable moiety of the\ncamping outfit to sell, and provision to buy; and Jeffard weighed his\ncompanion in the balances of his own shortcomings. He was well assured\nthat he could not trust himself with money in his hand in any such city\nof chanceful opportunity as the great carbonate camp; and arraigning\nGarvin at the bar of the same tribunal, he judged him before the fact.\n\nIt was a measure of the apathetic indifference which possessed Jeffard\nthat the premonition gave him scant concern. He marveled inwardly when\nthe fact of indifference defined itself. Aside from any promptings of\ncommon human gratitude evolving themselves into friendly solicitude for\nthe man who had twice saved his life,--promptings which he found dead\nbecause he looked to find them dead,--there was this: If his companion\nshould stumble and spill the scanty residue in the common purse the\nwolf-pack of famine and distress would be at their heels in a single\nsweep of the clock-hands. And yet the fact remained.\n\nJeffard was cogitating vaguely this curious manifestation of mental\nand moral inertia when the city of the altitudes came into view over\nthe crest of the final ascent in the toilsome journey. The smoke from\nthe smelters was trailing lazily toward the distant Mosquito, and a\nshifting cumulus of steam marked the snail-like advance of a railway\ntrain up the steep grade from Malta. California Gulch and the older\ntown were hidden behind the mountain of approach; but the upper town\nand its western environs lay stark in the hazeless atmosphere, with the\nsnow-splotched background of the nearer range, uptilted and immense,\ndwarfing the houses into hutch-like insignificance. Dreary as is this\nfirst view of the Mecca of wealth-seekers, it has quickened the pulse\nand brightened the eye of many a wayworn pilgrim of the mountain\ndesert; but Jeffard's thought was in his question to Garvin.\n\n\"Is it as near as it looks? or is it as far away as this cursed\nno-atmosphere removes everything?\"\n\n\"It's a good ten mile 'r so, yet. If we get a move on, we'll make it by\nsundown, maybe.\"\n\nThey tramped on in silence, the singing silence of the crystalline\nheights, measuring mile after mile at the heels of the patient burro,\nand reaching the scattering outposts of the western suburb while\nyet the sun hung hesitant above the peaks of the main range. The\nnearer aspect of the great mining-camp was inexpressibly depressive\nto Jeffard. The weathered buildings, frankly utilitarian and\ncorrespondingly unbeautiful; the harsh sterility of the rocky soil;\nthe ruthless subordination of all things to the sordid purposes of\nmoney-getting; these were the stage-settings of a scene which moved\nhim curiously, like the fumes of a mingled cup, intoxicating, but\nsoul-nauseating, withal. The nausea was a consequent of the changed\npoint of view, and he knew it; but it was no whit less grievous.\nWherefore he groped in the pool of indifference until he found a small\nstone of protest.\n\n\"Let us do what we have to do and get away from here quickly, Garvin,\"\nhe said, flinging the stone with what precision there was in him.\n\nThey had turned into the principal street, and the burro became\nreluctant. Garvin smote the beast from behind, and took a turn of the\nhalter around its jaw.\n\n\"Goin' to gig back for the crowd, ain't you?\" he growled,\napostrophizing the jack; and then to Jeffard: \"Makes you sort o'\ntown-sick, I reckon. I know the feel of it; used to catch it, reg'lar,\never' time I'd get in from the range. It'll wear off after a day 'r\nso; but, as you say, the quick way to do it up is to light out ag'in,\nsuddint.\"\n\n\"The sooner the better,\" said Jeffard. \"The atmosphere of the place is\nmaddening.\"\n\nGarvin took the word literally and laughed. \"'T ain't got no atmosphere\nto speak of,--that's what's the matter with it; too blame' high up for\nany use.\"\n\nThey were in the thick of the street traffic by this time, and\nit required their united malisons joined to what of energy and\ndetermination the long day's march had left them to keep the ass from\nplanting itself monument-wise in the middle of the street.\n\n\"Dad burn a canary, anyhow!\" grumbled the man of the wilderness, when\nthey were resting a moment in front of a shackly building on the\ncorner of a cross street. \"For ornerary, simon-pure, b'iled-down,\nsoul-killin'\"--His vocabulary of objurgatory expletives ran short, and\nhe wrought out the remainder of the malediction with a dumb show of\nviolence.\n\nJeffard smiled in spite of his mood, which was anything but farcical,\nand pointed to the haversack of specimens dangling from the loosened\npack.\n\n\"We're about to lose the samples,\" he said.\n\nGarvin regained his wonted good-humor at a plunge.\n\n\"That'd be too blame' bad, wouldn't it, now; they're so blazin'\nprecious! S'pose you lug 'em acrost yonder to that there assay-shop\nwhilst I toll the canary down to the corral. When you get shut o' the\nrocks, come on round to the boardin'-house,--'Miner's Rest,'--a block\nfurder along and two to your right. I'll meet you there bime-by, if\nthere's anything left o' me after I get through with this dad-burned,\nlop-eared totin'-machine.\"\n\nJeffard shouldered the bag of samples, but before he could reply the\nopportunity fled clamorous. The lop-eared one, finding itself free for\nthe moment, gave heed to a foolish bee buzzing in its atomic brain, and\nwent racing down the cross street, with the big miner in hot pursuit.\n\n\"Exit James Garvin,\" quoth Jeffard, moved to smile again; and he\ncrossed the avenue to the shackly building with the sign of the assayer\nbesprent upon the windows.\n\nWhen he tried the door and found it locked, and the littered room\nbeyond it empty, he was minded to go on to the rendezvous while\ndaylight served. But when he reflected that Garvin would be sure to\nawait an assayer's verdict on the samples, and so prolong their stay in\nthe city of banality, he decided to conclude the business affair first.\nSo he went up and down and around and about, and found all the assay\noffices closed for the day save one, whose occupant, a round-bodied\nlittle German, with the face of a cherub, martialized by the huge\nmustachios of a cuirassier, was still at his bench. Jeffard guessed at\nthe little man's nationality, and made a shrewd bid for celerity.\n\n\"_Guten abend, mein Herr_,\" he said, unslinging his haversack.\n\nThe cherubic face of the expatriated one responded quickly to the\ngreeting in the loved mother-tongue.\n\n\"_Wie geht's, wie geht's, mein guter Herr_,\" he rejoined; and then\nin broken English: \"I haf not dot Cherman before heard spoken in dis\nGott-forsaken blaces. You haf some sambles _gebracht_?\"\n\n\"_Ja, mein Herr._\"\n\n\"_Gut!_ I vill of dem de tests maig. _Nicht wahr?_\"\n\n\"_Gef\u00c3\u00a4lligst, mein lieber Herr_;\" and quickly,--\"we must go on our way\nagain to-morrow.\"\n\n\"So qvick? _Ach! das ist nicht sehr gut._ You vill der poor olt\nassay-meister maig to vork on der nide. But because you haf der goot\nCherman in your moud I vill it do. Vat you haf?\"\n\nJeffard unwrapped the samples one by one, and the assayer examined them\nwith many dubious head-shakings. The amateur made haste to anticipate\nthe preliminary verdict.\n\n\"I know they're valueless,\" he admitted, \"but I have a partner who will\nrequire your certificate before he will be convinced. Can you let us\nknow to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Because you haf der Cherman, yes. But it vill be no goot; der silwer\niss not dere\"--including the various specimens in a comprehensive\ngesture.\n\nJeffard turned to go, slinging the lightened haversack over his\nshoulder. At the door he bethought him of the curious fragment of\nquartz picked up on the dump of the abandoned tunnel. It was in his\npocket, and he rummaged till he found it.\n\n\"Can you tell me anything about this?\" he asked. \"It seems to be a\ndecomposed quartzite, matted on a base of some sort,--a metal, I should\nsay.\"\n\nThe little German snatched the bit of quartz, and ogled it eagerly\nthrough his eye-glass.\n\n\"_Mein Gott im Himmel!_\" he cried; and the eye-glass fell to the floor\nand rolled under the bench. \"Iss it possible dot you know him not? Dot\niss golt, _mein lieber freund_,--vire golt, reech, reech! Vere you got\nhim? Haf you got some more _von_ dis?\"\n\nJeffard took it in vaguely, and tried to remember what he had done with\nthe handful of similar fragments gathered at the same time. It came\nto him presently. He had emptied his pocket into the haversack on the\nmorning of the departure from the valley what time Garvin was seeking\nthe strayed burro.\n\nHe unslung the canvas bag and poured the handful of gravel on the\nbench. The assayer, trembling now with repressed excitement, examined\nthe snuff-colored quartz, bit by bit, with a guttural ejaculation for\neach. \"_Donnerwetter!_ He gifs me feerst der vorthless stones to maig\nof dem de assay, und den he vill ask me von leedle qvestion about\ndis--dis maknificend bonansa! _Ach! mein freund!_ haf you got _viel_ of\ndis precious qvartz?\"\n\n\"Why, yes; there's a good bit of it, I believe,\" replied Jeffard,\nstill unawake to the magnitude of the discovery.\n\n\"Und you can find der blaces again? Dink aboud it now--dink hardt!\"\n\nJeffard smiled. \"Don't get excited, _mein Herr_. I know the place very\nwell, indeed; I left it only three days since.\"\n\n\"_Gut; sehr gut!_ Now go you; go und leef me to _mein_ vork. Come you\nback in der _morgen_, und I vill tell you dot you are reech, reech! Go,\n_mein freund_, mit der goot Cherman in your moud--und Gott go mit you.\"\n\nJeffard felt his way down the dark stair, and so on out into the\nlighted street, still only in the middle ground between realization\nand the bare knowledge of the fact. He was conscious of some vague\nrecurrent effort to surround the incredible thing; and conscious, too,\nthat it grew and spread with each succeeding attempt to measure it\nuntil no mere human arms could girdle it.\n\nNot yet did it occur to him to place himself at the nodus of discovery\nand possession. The miraculous thing was for him quite a thing\napart; and when he had advanced far enough into the open country of\nrealization to look a little about him, his thought was wholly for\nGarvin and the effect upon him of this sudden projection into the\ninfinite. He tried to imagine the simple-hearted prospector as a man\nof affluence, and laughed aloud at the grotesque figure conjured up by\nthe thought. What would Garvin do with his money? Squander it royally,\nlike a loyal son of fortune, and think the world well lost, Jeffard\ndecided.\n\nThe hissing gasoline torch of a street fakir flared gustily in the\nkeen night wind sweeping down from the Mosquito, and the scintillant\narc-stars at the corners began to take on frosty aureoles of prismatic\nhues. The crowds on the resonant plank sidewalks streamed boisterous\nand masterful, as if the plangent spirit of time and place were abroad.\nJeffard came to earth again in the rude jostling of the throng. While\nhe speculated, Garvin--Garvin the inexpectant--was doubtless awaiting\nhim at the place appointed. He must hasten thither to be the bearer of\nthe good news to the unspoiled one.\n\nLooking about him to get his bearings, he found himself in front of\nthe deserted assay office on the spot where he had parted from Garvin.\n\"One square down and two to the right,\" he said, repeating Garvin's\ndirections; and he set out to trudge them doggedly, lagging a little\nfrom honest leg-weariness. In the last half of the third square there\nwas a screened doorway, and the click of celluloid counters came to his\nears from the brilliantly lighted room beyond. At the sound the embers\nof the fire kindled months before glowed afresh and made his heart hot.\n\n\"Ah, you're there yet, are you?\" he said, speaking to the stirring\npassion as if it were a sentient entity within him. \"Well, you'll have\nto lie down again; there's no meat on the bone.\"\n\nAt the designated corner he found the rendezvous. It was a hostelry\nof the baser sort, with a bar-room dominant, and eating and sleeping\nconveniences--or inconveniences--subsidiary. The clatter of knives and\nforks on ironstone china came from the ill-smelling dining-room in the\nrear, and the bar-room held but one occupant. It was Garvin; he was\nsitting at one of the card-tables with his head in his arms. He looked\nup when Jeffard entered, and his smile was of fatigue.\n\n\"Hello, there; thought you'd gone and got lost in the shuffle. Get shut\nof 'em?\"\n\nJeffard nodded.\n\n\"No good, I reckon?\"\n\n\"No; nothing that we've found this summer. But you're a rich man, just\nthe same, Garvin.\"\n\n\"Yes; I've cashed in on the outfit, and I've got twenty dollars in my\ninside pocket. Let's go in and chew before them fellers eat it all up.\"\n\n\"Don't be in a hurry; the kind of supper we'll get here can wait. I\nsaid you are a rich man, and I meant it. You remember the old hole up\nin the hillside above the camp,--the one you struck a 'dike' in two\nyears ago?\"\n\n\"Reckon I ain't likely to forget it.\"\n\n\"Well, that 'dike' was decomposed quartz carrying free gold. I was\ncurious enough to put a handful of the stuff into my pocket and bring\nit out. The assayer's at work on it now, and he says it'll run high--up\ninto the hundreds, I imagine. Is there much of it?\"\n\nThe effect of the announcement on the unspoiled one was like that\nof an electric shock. He staggered to his feet, went white under the\nbronze, and flung his arms about Jeffard.\n\n\"Hooray!\" he shouted; \"that old hole--that same derned old hole 'at\nI've cussed out more'n a million times! Damn my fool soul, but I knew\nyou was a Mascot--knew it right from the jump! Come on--let's irrigate\nit right now, 'fore it's a minute older!\"\n\nIt was out of the depth of pure good-fellowship that Jeffard went to\nthe bar with the fortune-daft miner. Not all the vicissitudes of the\nbreathless rush down the inclined plane had been sufficient to slay the\nepicure in him; and the untidy bar reeked malodorous. But the occasion\nwas its own excuse.\n\nGarvin beat upon the bar with his fist, and the roar of his summons\ndrowned the clatter of knives and forks in the adjacent dining-room.\nThe bartender came out, wiping his lips on the back of his hand.\n\n\"What'll it be, gents?\"\n\n\"The best you've got ain't good enough,\" said Garvin, with unwitting\nsarcasm. \"Trot her out--three of a kind. It's on me, and the house is\nin it.\"\n\nThe man spun two glasses across the bar, and set out a black bottle of\ndubious aspect. Knowing his own stock in trade, he drew himself a glass\nof Apollinaris water.\n\nJeffard sniffed at the black bottle and christened his glass sparingly.\nThe bouquet of the liquor was an entire round of dissipation with the\nsubsequent headache thrown in. Garvin tilted the bottle with trembling\nhand, and filled his glass to the brim. The object-lesson was not\nthrown away upon the epicure.\n\n\"Here's to the derned old hole with a cold million in it,\" said the\nminer, naming the toast and draining his glass in the same breath. And\nthen: \"Come again, barkeep'; drink water yourself, if you want to, but\nthe red likker's good enough for us. What do ye say, pardner? We're in\nit at last, plum up to the neck, and all on account o' that derned old\nhole 'at I've cussed out a mil-- Here's lookin' at ye.\"\n\nJeffard merely moistened his lips the second time, and the\nobject-lesson exemplified itself. Garvin had brimmed his glass again,\nand the contents of the black bottle were adulterant poisons. Wherefore\nhe cut in quickly when Garvin would have ordered again.\n\n\"That'll do, old man; a little at a time and often, if you must, but\nnot on an empty stomach. Let's get the money before we spend it.\"\n\nThe latter part of the warning had special significance for the\nbartender, who scowled ominously.\n\n\"Lemme see the color o' yer money,\" he commanded. \"If youse fellies are\nrunnin' futures on me\"--\n\nNow Garvin had been living the life of an anchoret for many weeks, and\nthe fumes of the fiery liquor were already mounting to his brain. For\nwhich cause the bartender's insinuation was as spark to tow.\n\n\"Futures?\" he yelled, throwing down a ten-dollar bill with a mighty\nbuffet on the bar; \"them's the kind o' futures we're drinkin' on right\nnow! Why, you thick-lipped, mealy-mouthed white nigger, you, I'll come\ndown here some day and buy the floor out from in under your feet; see?\nCome on, pardner; let's mog along out o' here 'fore I'm tempted to mop\nup his greasy floor with this here\"--\n\nThere was hot wrath in the bartender's eyes, and Jeffard hustled the\nabusive one out of the place lest a worse thing should follow. On the\nsidewalk he remembered what Garvin had already forgotten, and went\nback for the change out of the ten-dollar bill, dropping it into his\npocket and rejoining his companion before the latter had missed him.\nThereupon ensued a war of words. The newly belted knight of fortune was\nfor making a night of it; and when Jeffard would by no means consent to\nthis, Garvin insisted upon going to the best hotel in the city, where\nthey might live at large as prospective millionaires should.\n\nJeffard accepted the alternative, and constituted himself bearward in\nordinary to the half-crazed son of the wilderness. He saw difficulties\nahead, and the event proved that he did not overestimate them. What a\nhalf-intoxicated man, bent upon becoming wholly intoxicated, may do to\nmake thorny the path of a self-constituted guardian Garvin did that\nnight. At the hotel he scandalized the not too curious clerk, and\nbecame the centre of an appreciative group in the rotunda what time\nJeffard was pleading the mitigating circumstances with the hesitant\ndeputy proprietor. In the midst of the plea, when Jeffard had consented\nto assume all responsibility for his companion's vagaries, Garvin broke\ncover in the direction of the bar-room, followed by a tail of thirsty\nones.\n\n\"You say you know him?\" said the clerk tentatively.\n\n\"Know him? Why, yes; he is my partner. We are just in from the range,\nand he has struck it rich. It's a little too much for him just now, but\nhe'll quiet down after a bit. He is one of the best fellows alive, when\nhe's sober; and this is the first time I've ever seen him in liquor.\nTwo drinks of bad whiskey did it.\"\n\n\"Two drinks and a surfeit of good luck,\" laughed the clerk. \"Well,\nwe'll take him; but you must keep him out of the way. He'll be crazy\ndrunk in less than an hour. Been to supper?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Better have it sent to your room. He isn't fit to go to the\ndining-room.\"\n\n\"All right; have a bell-boy ready, and I'll knock him down and drag him\nout, if I can.\"\n\nThat was easier said than done. Jeffard found the foolish one in the\nbar-room, drinking _ad libitum_, and holding forth to a circle of\ninterested hearers. Garvin had evidently been recounting the history\nof the abandoned claim, and one of the listeners, a hawk-faced man,\nwith shifty black eyes, was endeavoring to draw him aside. He succeeded\njust as Jeffard thrust his way into the circle, and the self-elected\nbearwarden caught the whispered question and its answer.\n\n\"You say you located her two years ago?\" queried the hawk-faced one.\n\n\"No; that's the joke o' the whole shootin'-match,--thess like I was\na-tellin' ye.\" Garvin's speech ran back to its native Tennessee idiom\nat the bidding of intoxication. \"She ain't nev' been located _yit_;\nand if it hadn't 'a' been for that derned little sharp-eyed pardner o'\nmine\"--\n\nThe questioner turned quickly to the bar.\n\n\"Drinks all round, gentlemen--on me.\" Then to Garvin in the cautious\nundertone: \"You said she was over in Stray Horse Valley, didn't you?\"\n\nGarvin fell into the trap headlong. \"Not much I didn't! She's\na-snugglin' down under one o' the bigges' peaks in the Saguache, right\nwhar she can listen to the purlin' o' the big creek that heads in\"--\n\nThere was no time for diplomatic interference. Jeffard locked his arm\nabout Garvin's head, and dragged the big man bodily out of the circle.\n\n\"You fool!\" he hissed. \"Will you pitch it into the hands of the first\nman that asks for it? Come along out of this!\"\n\nGarvin stood dazed, and a murmur of disapproval ran through the group\nof thirsters. The hand of the hawk-faced one stole by imperceptible\ndegrees toward his hip pocket. Jeffard stopped it with a look.\n\n\"You have had fun enough with my partner for one evening, gentlemen,\"\nhe said sternly. \"Come on, Jim; let's go to supper.\"\n\nAnd the thirsters saw them no more.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nIT was midnight and worse before the lately belted knight of fortune\nhad outworn the hilarious and entered upon the somnolent stage of the\nlittle journey insensate, and when the thing could be done, Jeffard\nput him to bed with a p\u00c3\u00a6an of thanksgiving which was none the less\nheartfelt for being unvocalized.\n\nHaving thus set his hand to Garvin's plough, there was no alternative\nbut to turn the furrow to the end; wherefore, to guard against\nsurprises, he hid the boots of the bottle-mad one, barricaded the door\nwith his own bed, and lay down to doze with eyelids ajar. At least that\nwas the alert determination; but the event proved that he was weary\nenough to sleep soundly and late, and it was seven o'clock, and the\nbreakfast caller was hammering on the door, when he opened his eyes on\nthe new day. Naturally, his first thought was for his companion, and\nthe sight of the empty bed in the farther corner of the room brought\nhim broad awake and afoot at the same saltatory moment. The son of\nfortune was gone, and an open door into the adjoining room accounted\nfor the manner of his going.\n\nFive minutes later, picture an anxious brother-keeper making pointed\ninquiries of the day-clerk below stairs. Instant question and answer\nfly back and forth shuttle-wise, one may suppose, weaving suspicion\ninto a firm fabric of fact. Two men whose names, or whose latest\naliases, were Howard and Lantermann, had occupied the room next to\nJeffard's,--quite chancefully, the clerk thinks. They had left at an\nearly hour; their call was for--one moment, and he (the clerk) will\nascertain the exact time.\n\nWhereupon one may fancy an exasperated bearwarden cursing exactnesses\nand beating with impatient fist upon the counter for the major fact.\nThe fact, extorted at length, is simple and conclusive. The two men\nhad come down some time between five and six o'clock, with a third as\na middle link in a chain of locked arms. One of the two had paid the\nbill, and they had all departed; by way of the bar-room and the side\nentrance, as the clerk remembers.\n\nWhereat Jeffard is moved to swear strange oaths; is swearing them, in\npoint of fact, when the omnibus from an early train shunts its cargo\nof arrivals into the main entrance. Among the incomers is a big fellow\nwith a drooping mustache and square-set shoulders, who forthwith drops\nhis handbag and pounces upon Jeffard with greetings boisterous.\n\n\"Well, I'll be shot!--or words to that effect\" (hand-wringings and\nshoulder-clappings). \"Now where on top of God's green earth did you\ntumble from? Begin away back yonder and give an account of yourself;\nor, hold on,--let me write my name in the book and then you can tell\nme while we eat. By Jove, old man! I'm foolishly glad to see you!\"\n\nJeffard cut in quickly between the large-hearted protest and the\nsigning of the register.\n\n\"Just a second, Bartrow; let the breakfast wait, and listen to me. I'm\nin no end of a tangle, and you're the man of all others to help me out\nif any one can. Do you happen to know a fellow named Garvin?\"\n\n\"Don't I? 'Tennessee Jim, P. P.,'--that stands for perennial\nprospector, you know. Sure. He's of the salt of the earth; rock salt,\nbut full flavored. I know him like a book, though I hadn't seen him for\na dog's-age until--but go on.\"\n\nJeffard did go on, making the occasion one of the few which seemed to\njustify the setting aside of indirection.\n\n\"We were partners; we have been out together all summer. He has struck\nit rich, and has gone clean daft in the lilt of it. I can't get him\nsober long enough to do what may be necessary to secure the claim. The\nsharks are after him hot foot, and if they can succeed in soaking the\ndata out of him, they will jump the claim before he can get it located\nand recorded.\"\n\nBartrow laughed. \"That's just like Jim: ordinarily, he doesn't drink\nas much whiskey in a year as most men do in a week. But if that's your\nonly grief you can come to breakfast with me and take your time about\nit. Later on, when we've smoked a few lines and brought up the arrears\nof gossip, we'll hold a council of war and see what you're to do about\nthe potential bonanza.\"\n\n\"But I can't do anything; it's Garvin's, I tell you.\"\n\n\"Well, you are partners in it, aren't you?\"\n\nJeffard had another fight with an ingrained reserve which was always\nblocking the way to directness and prompting him to leave the major\nfact unstated.\n\n\"We are not partners in this particular claim. It's an old discovery of\nGarvin's. He drove the tunnel on it two years ago and then abandoned\nit. He was looking for tellurides and opened a vein of free-gold quartz\nwithout knowing what he had found.\"\n\n\"Then it's nobody's claim, as it stands; or rather I should say it's\nanybody's. You--or rather Garvin--will have to begin at the beginning,\njust as if it were a new deal; go back and post a notice on the ground\nand then come out and record it. And if it's Garvin's claim, as you\nsay, he's got to do this in person. Nobody can do it for him. You can't\nturn a wheel till you get hold of Jim, and that's what makes me say\nwhat I 'does.' Let's go in and eat.\"\n\n\"But, Dick; you don't understand\"--\n\n\"Yes, I do; and I happen to know a thing or two about this deal that\nyou don't. You've got the whole forenoon before you; you are as safe as\na house up to twelve o'clock. Come on.\"\n\n\"I say you don't understand. You called it a 'potential bonanza' just\nnow, meaning that it wouldn't make so very much difference if it were\nnever recorded. But it's a bonanza in fact. If Rittenberger knows what\nhe is talking about, it is the biggest strike of the year, by long\nodds. I don't know much about such things, but it seems to me it ought\nto be secured at once and at all hazards.\"\n\n\"Rittenberger, you say?--the little Dutchman? You can bank on what he\ntells you, every time. I didn't know you'd been to an assayer. What is\nthe figure?\"\n\n\"I don't know that. I left the sample with him last night, and was to\ncall this morning for the certificate. But the little man bubbled over\nat the mere sight of it.\"\n\n\"Good for old Jim! So much the better. Nevertheless, as I say, you've\nan easy half-hour in which to square yourself with me over the ham and\neggs and what-not, and plenty of time to do what there is to be done\nafterward. You can't do anything but wait.\"\n\n\"Yes, I can; I can find Garvin and make sure of him. Don't you see\"--\n\n\"I see that I'll have to tell you all I know--and that's something you\nnever do for anybody--before you'll be reasonable. Listen, then: I saw\nyour chump of a partner less than an hour ago. He was with two of his\nold cronies, and all three of them were pretty well in the push, for\nthis early in the morning. They boarded the train I came up on, and\nthat is why I say you're safe till noon. There is no train from the\nwest till twelve-seven. I know Jim pretty well, and at his foolishest\nhe never quite loses his grip. He had it in mind that he ought to fight\nshy of something or somebody, and he's given you the slip, dodged the\nenemy, and gone off on a three-handed spree all in a bunch. There now,\ndoes that clear up the mystery?\"\n\nJeffard had caught at the counter-rail and was gradually petrifying.\nHere was the worst that could have befallen, and Bartrow had suspected\nnothing more than a drunken man's frolic.\n\n\"Gone?--with two men, you say? Can you describe them?\"\n\n\"Roughly, yes; they were Jim's kind--miners or prospectors. One of them\nwas tall and thin and black, and the other was rather thick-set and\nred. The red one was the drunkest of the three.\"\n\n\"Dressed like miners?\" Jeffard had to fight for the \"s's.\" His tongue\nwas thick and his lips dry.\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"That settles it, Dick, definitely. Last night those two fellows were\ndressed like men about town and wore diamonds. They've soaked their\ninformation out of Garvin, and they are on their way to locate that\nclaim.\"\n\nIt was Bartrow's turn to gasp and stammer. \"What?--locate the--C\u00c3\u00a6sar's\nghost, man, you're daft! They wouldn't take Garvin with them!\"\n\n\"They would do just that. In the first place, with the most accurate\ndescription of the locality that Garvin, drunk, could give them, there\nwould be the uncertainty of finding it without a guide. They know that\nthey have left a sane man behind them who can find the way back to the\nclaim; and their only chance was to take Garvin along, keeping him\ndrunk enough to be unsuspicious, and not too drunk to pilot them. Once\non the ground ahead of me, and with Garvin in their power, they can do\nthe worst.\"\n\nBartrow came alive to the probabilities in the catching of a breath.\n\"Which will be to kill Garvin safely out of the way, post the claim,\nand snap their fingers at the world. Good Lord!--and I let 'em knock\nhim down and drag him out under my very eyes! I'd ought to be shot.\"\n\n\"It's not your fault, Dick; it's mine. I saw what was in the wind\nlast night, and stuck to Garvin till I got him to bed. I was\ndog-tired,--we'd been tramping all day,--and I thought he was safe to\nsleep the clock around. I hid his boots, dragged my bed across the\ndoor, and went to sleep.\"\n\n\"You couldn't have done less--or more. What happened?\"\n\n\"This. Those two fellows had the room next to us, and there was a door\nbetween. They slipped him out this morning before I was awake.\"\n\n\"Of course; all cut out and shaped up beforehand. But, thank the Lord,\nthere's a ghost of a chance yet. Where is the claim?\"\n\n\"It is three days' march a little to the south of west, on the\nheadwaters of a stream which flows into the Gunnison River.\"\n\n\"And the nearest railroad point?\"\n\n\"Is Aspen. If I remember correctly, Garvin said it was about twenty\nmiles across the range.\"\n\n\"Good. That accounts for the beginning of the race; they'll go to Aspen\nand take horses from there. But I don't understand why they took the\nlong line. There are two railroads to Aspen, and one of them is an\nhour and twenty minutes longer than the other. That's your chance, and\nthe only one,--to beat 'em to the end of the railroad run. How are you\nfixed?\"\n\n\"For money, you mean? I have the wreck of a ten-dollar note and a hotel\nbill to pay.\"\n\nBartrow spun around on his heel and shot a sudden question at the hotel\nclerk, the answer to which was inaudible to Jeffard. But Bartrow's\nrejoinder was explanatory.\n\n\"Rooms over the bank, you say? That's lucky.\" This to the clerk; and\nthen to Jeffard: \"Come along with me; this is no time to stick at\ntrifles. You've got to have money, suddenly, and plenty of it.\"\n\nBut Jeffard hung back.\n\n\"What are you going to do, Dick?\"\n\n\"Stake you and let you try for a special engine over the short line.\nThose fellows took the long way around, as I say,--why, I don't know,\nbecause both trains leave at the same time. The running time the way\nthey have gone is five hours and forty-five minutes. By the other line\nit's only four hours and twenty-five minutes. Savez?\"\n\n\"Yes, but\"--\n\n\"Weed out the 'buts' and come along. We're due to rout a man out of bed\nand make him open a bank vault. I can't put my hand into my pocket for\nyou, as I'd like to; but I know a banker, and my credit's good.\"\n\nThey found the cashier of the Carbonate City National in the midst of\nhis toilet. He was an Eastern man of conservative habit, but he was\nsufficiently Occidentalized to grasp the main points in Bartrow's terse\nnarrative, and to rise to the inexorable demands of the occasion.\n\n\"You know the rule, Mr. Bartrow,--two good names; and I don't know your\nfriend. But this seems to be an eighteen-carat emergency. Take that key\nand go down the back way into the bank. You'll find blank notes on the\npublic desk. Make out your paper for what Mr. Jeffard will need, and\nI'll be with you in half a minute.\"\n\nThey found the way and the blank, which latter Bartrow hastily filled\nout, indorsed, and handed to Jeffard for signature. It was for five\nhundred dollars, and the proletary's hand shook when he dipped the pen.\n\n\"It's too much,\" he protested; \"I can't stand it, Dick. It is like\nputting a whetted sword into the hands of a madman.\"\n\nThat was his first reference to the past and its smirched record, and\nBartrow promptly toppled it into the abyss of generalities.\n\n\"Same old hair-splitter, aren't you? What's the matter with you now?\"\n\n\"You know--better than any one. I am not to be trusted with any such\nsum of money.\"\n\n\"Call it Garvin's, then. I don't know how you feel toward Jim, but I've\nalways found him a man to tie to.\"\n\nA woman would have said that Jeffard turned aside to hide an upflash of\nemotion, though a clot on the pen was the excuse. But it was the better\npart of him that made answer.\n\n\"I owe him my life--twice, Dick. By all the known hypotheses of honor\nand gratitude and common decency I ought to be true to him now, in this\nhis day of helplessness. But when one has eaten and drunk and slept\nwith infamy\"--\n\nThe cashier's step was on the stair, and Bartrow cut in swiftly.\n\n\"Jeffard, you make me weary!--and, incidentally, you're killing\nprecious time. Can't you see that trust isn't a matter of much or\nlittle? If you can't, why just name the amount for which you'd be\ntempted to drop Garvin, and we'll cut under it so as to be on the safe\nside.\"\n\n\"But I sha'n't need a fifth of this,\" Jeffard objected, wavering.\n\n\"You are liable to need more. You must remember that ten minutes hence\nyou'll be trying to subsidize a railroad company. Sign that note and\nquit quibbling about it.\"\n\nThe thing was done, but when the money had changed hands, Jeffard\nquibbled again.\n\n\"If the worst comes, you can't afford to pay that note, Bartrow; and\nmy probability hangs on a hundred hazards. What if I fail?\"\n\nThe cashier had unlocked the street door for them, and Bartrow ran the\nsplitter of hairs out to the sidewalk.\n\n\"You're not going to fail if I can ever succeed in getting you in\nmotion. Good Lord, man! can't you wake up and get a grip of the\nsituation? It isn't the mere saving or losing of the bonanza; it's\nsheer life or death to Jim Garvin--and you say you owe him. Here,--this\ncab is as good as any. Midland office, my man; half time, double fare.\nDon't spare the leather.\"\n\nAt eight-ten to the minute they were negotiating with the\nsuperintendent's chief clerk for a special engine to Aspen. Whereupon,\nas is foreordained in such crises, difficulties multiplied themselves,\nwhile the office clock's decorous pendulum ticked off the precious\nmargin of time. Bartrow fought this battle, fought it single-handed and\nwon; but that was because his weapon was invincible. The preliminary\npassage at arms vocalized itself thus:--\n\n_The Clerk_, mindful of his superior's moods, and reflectively\ndubitant: \"I'm afraid I haven't the authority. You will have to wait\nand see the superintendent. He'll be down at nine.\"\n\n_Bartrow_: \"Make it a dollar a mile.\"\n\n_The Clerk_: \"Can't be done; or, at least, I can't do it. We're short\nof motive power. There isn't an engine fit for the run at this end of\nthe division.\"\n\n_Bartrow_: \"Say a hundred and fifty for the trip.\"\n\n_The Clerk_: \"I'm afraid we couldn't make it, anyhow. We'd have to send\na caller after a crew, and\"--\n\n_Bartrow_, sticking to his single text like a phonograph set to repeat:\n\"Call it a hundred and seventy-five.\"\n\n_The Clerk_, in a desperate aside: \"Heavens! I wish the old man\nwould come!\"--and aloud--\"Say, I don't believe we could better the\npassenger schedule, even with a light engine. It's fast--four hours and\ntwenty-five\"--\n\n_Bartrow_: \"Make it two hundred.\"\n\nJeffard counted out the money while the office operator was calling the\nengine-dispatcher; and at eight-twenty they were pacing the station\nplatform, waiting for the ordered special. Bartrow looked at his watch.\n\n\"If you get away from here at eight-thirty, you'll have three hours and\nthirty-five minutes for the run, which is just fifty minutes better\nthan the regular schedule. It'll be nip and tuck, but if your engineer\nis any good he'll make it. Do you know what to do when you reach Aspen?\"\n\n\"Why, yes; I'll meet Garvin when his train arrives, cut him out of the\ntangle with the sharks, get him on a horse and ride for life across the\nrange.\"\n\n\"That's the scheme. But what if the other fellows object?\"\n\nJeffard straightened himself unconsciously. \"I'm not uncertain on that\nside; I can fight for it, if that is what you mean.\"\n\nBartrow looked him up and down with a smile which was grimly\napprobative. \"Your summer's done you a whole lot of good, Jeffard. You\nlook like a grown man.\"\n\n\"As I didn't when you last saw me. But I'm afraid I am neither better\nnor worse, Dick,--morally.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! You can't help being one or the other. And that reminds me:\nyou haven't accounted for yourself yet. Can you do it in the hollow of\na minute?\"\n\n\"Just about. Garvin picked me out of the gutter and took me with him on\nthis prospecting trip. That's all.\"\n\n\"But you ought to have left word with somebody. It was rough on your\nfriends to drop out as if you'd dodged the undertaker.\"\n\n\"Who was there to care?\"\n\n\"Well, I cared, for one; and then there is Lansdale, and--and\"--\n\n\"I know,\" said Jeffard humbly. He was hungry for news, but he went\nfasting on the thinnest paring of inquiry. \"Does she remember me yet?\"\n\nBartrow nodded. \"She's not of the forgetting kind. I never go to\nDenver that she doesn't ask me if I've heard of you. But that's Connie\nElliott, every day in the week. She's got a heartful of her own just\nnow, too, I take it, but that doesn't make any difference. She's\neverybody's sister, just the same.\"\n\n\"A--a heartful of her own, you say? I don't quite understand.\" Jeffard\nwas staring intently down the empty railway yard, and the glistening\nlines of steel were blurred for him.\n\nIt was a situation for a bit of merciful diplomacy, but Bartrow the\ntactless blundered on remorselessly.\n\n\"Why, yes,--with Lansdale, you know. I don't know just how far it has\ngone, but if I were going to put money on it, I'd say she would let her\nlife be shortened year for year if his could be spun out in proportion.\"\n\nJeffard brought himself up with a savage turn. Who was he that he\nshould be privileged as those who are slain in any honorable cause?\n\n\"Lansdale is no better, then?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Sometimes he thinks he is. But I guess it's written\nin the book; and I'm sorry--for his sake and hers. There comes your\nautomobile.\"\n\nA big engine was clanking up through the yard, but Jeffard did not turn\nto look at it. He was wringing Bartrow's hand, and trying vainly to\nthink of some message to send to the woman he loved. And at the end of\nit, it went unsaid. One of the clerks was waiting with the train-order\nwhen the engine steamed up; and Jeffard was fain to clamber to his\nplace in the cab, full to the lips with tender embassies, which would\nby no means array themselves in words.\n\nBartrow waited till he could fling his God-speed up to the cab window.\nIt took the form of a parting injunction, and neither of them suspected\nhow much it would involve.\n\n\"If you need backing in Aspen, look up Mark Denby. He's a good friend\nof mine; an all-around business man, and a guardian angel to fellows\nwith holes in the ground and no ready money. Hunt him up. I'll wire\nyour introduction and have it there ahead of you. Off you go--good luck\nto you!\"\n\nAnd at the word the big engine lifted its voice with a shout and a\nbell-clang, and shook itself free for the race.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nFROM Leadville to the point in the sky-line of the Continental Divide\nwhere the southern shoulder of Mount Massive dips to Hagerman's Pass,\nthe railway grade climbs with the old Glenwood trail; and when Malta\nwas left behind and the ascent fairly begun, Jeffard had fleeting\nglimpses of the road over which he and Garvin and the patient burro\nhad toiled eastward the day before. From outer curves and promontories\ndoubled at storming speed the hoof-beaten trail flicked into view\nand disappeared; and at times the brief vistas framed a reminiscent\npicture of two foot-weary pilgrims plodding doggedly in the wake of a\npack-laden ass.\n\nIt was impossible to conceive that these phantoms belonged to\nto-day's yesterday. The crowding events of a few hours had already\npushed them into a far-away past; their entities were lost in the\nkaleidoscopic whirl which had transformed the two men no less than\ntheir prefigurings. What had the foolish witling raving yonder on his\nway to despoilment and death with the two plunderers in common with\nthe self-contained son of the wilderness, who had but yesterday been\nhis brother's keeper in a world of disheartenment? And this other;\nsteam-hurrying on his way to the same goal, with set jaw and tight\nlips and resolute purpose in his eyes; by how much or little could he\nbe identified with the undeterminate one, whose leaden-footed trudgings\nthe storming locomotive was taking in reverse?\n\nThrough some such cycle the wheel of reflection rolled around to its\nstarting point in things present, and Jeffard awoke to the moving\nrealities of steep grades and breath-cutting curves, yawning abysses\nand hurtling cliffs, flitting backward to the cacophone _obbligato_\nof the exhaust and the clangorous cries of racking machinery. The\nengineer braced on his box was a muscular giant, with the jaw of a\nprizefighter, and steel-gray eyes that had long since looked death out\nof countenance. Jeffard took his measure in an appraisive glance. \"If\nyour engineer is good for anything,\" Bartrow had said; and the glance\nslew the conditional doubt. What a fearless driver of fast locomotives\nmight do toward reversing the fate of the besotted one would be done.\n\nIn the mean time the race was to the judicious rather than to the\nswift. The interminable succession of grades and curves clogged the\nwheels, and the great engine snorted and wallowed on its upward way,\nslowing down at times until the throbbing puffs of the escaping steam\nseemed to beat no more than leisurely minuet-time. But the climbing\nmiles to the summit of the pass were measured doggedly, if not with\nspeed. No trifling advantage of tangent or \"let-up\" was passed without\nfresh spurrings of the throttle; and when the engine swept around the\nlong curve which is the approach to the telegraph station at the\nsummit tunnel, the engineer glanced at his watch and nodded across to\nhis passenger.\n\n\"We're goin' to make it,\" he said, in answer to Jeffard's shouted\ninquiry. \"It'll be a close call, but the old Ninety-seven's a bird.\"\n\nAt the station the operator tossed a telegram through the cab window.\nIt was from Bartrow, and its major purpose was to give the figures of\nthe assay, which he had obtained from the little German. They were\nsufficiently significant, and Bartrow's added urgings were unnecessary.\n\"I'm standing over the train dispatcher here with a club,\" he wired.\n\"Don't make any economical mistake at your end of the string.\"\n\nThe engineer had finished oiling around and had clambered back to his\nbox. The water supply was replenished, and the fireman was uprearing\nthe tank-spout. Jeffard crossed the footboard and thrust a little roll\nof bank notes between the fingers of the brawny hand on the throttle\nlever. The engineer smoothed the bills on his knee and wagged his head\nas one doubtful.\n\n\"That's pretty well up to a month's pay.\"\n\n\"Well, you are going to earn it.\"\n\n\"Better keep it till I do,\" said the stalwart one, offering it back.\n\n\"No; I'm not afraid to pay you in advance. You are going to do your\nbest, and I am not trying to bribe you. It's yours, whether we make it\nor not.\"\n\nThe big man thrust the bills into his pocket and opened the throttle.\n\"You go over there and sit down and hold your hair on,\" he commanded.\n\"I'm goin' to break the record when we get out into daylight on the\nother side o' the mountain.\"\n\nJeffard was still groping for hand and foot holds on the fireman's\nseat when the locomotive rolled out of the western portal of the\nsummit tunnel and the record-breaking began. Of the brain-benumbing\nrush down the gorges of the Frying Pan on a flying locomotive, one\nrecalls but a confused memory; a phantasmagoric jumble of cliffs and\nchasms, backward-flitting forests and gyrating mountain peaks, trestles\nand culverts roaring beneath the drumming wheels, the shrieks of the\nwhistle and the intermittent stridor of escaping steam in the iron\nthroat of the safety-valve; a goblin dance of matter in motion to a war\nblast of chaotic uproar. One sets the teeth to endure, and comes back\nto the cosmic point of view with a deep-drawn sigh of relief when the\ngoblin dance is over, and the engine halts at the junction where the\nAspen branch leaves the main line and crosses the Frying Pan to begin\nthe ascent of the Roaring Fork.\n\nFrom this point the competing railways parallel each other, and at the\njunction the trains on either line are within whistle call. To the\nengineer's question the telegraph operator nodded an affirmative.\n\n\"Yep; she's just gone by. That's her whistlin' for Emma now. What's the\nrush?--backed to beat her into Aspen?\"\n\nThe engineer nodded in his turn, and signed the order for the right\nof way on the branch. A minute later the junction station was also\na memory, and Jeffard was straining his eyes for a glimpse of the\npassenger train on the other line. A short distance to the southward\nthe rival lines meet and cross, exchanging river banks for the\nremainder of the run to Aspen. The passenger train was first at the\ncrossing, and Jeffard had his glimpse as the engine slackened speed.\nNot to lose a rail-length in the hard-fought race, Jeffard's man ran\nclose to the crossing to await his turn, and the light engine came to a\nstand within pistol shot of the train, which was slowly clanking over\nthe crossing-frogs. Jeffard slipped from his seat and went over to the\nengineer's gangway. It would be worth something if he could make sure\nthat Garvin was on the train.\n\nThe espial was rewarded and punished in swift sequence. The trucks of\nthe smoking-car were jolting over the crossing, and Jeffard saw the\nhead and shoulders of the insane one filling an open window. It was\nconspicuously evident that Garvin had drained the bottle to the frenzy\nmark. He was yelling like a lost soul, and shaking impotent fists at\nthe halted engine. Jeffard's eye measured the distance to the moving\ncar. It was but down one embankment and up the other.\n\n\"That's my man,\" he said quickly to the engineer. \"Do you suppose I\ncould make it across?\"\n\n\"Dead easy,\" was the reply; and Jeffard swung down to the step of the\nengine to drop off. The impulse saved his life. As he quitted his hold\na hairy arm bared to the elbow was thrust out of the window next to\nthe yelling maniac. There was a glint of sun-rays on polished metal,\nand a pistol ball bit out the corner of the cab under the engineer's\narm-rest. Jeffard desisted, and climbed to his place when the moving\ntrain gathered headway.\n\n\"Damn a crazy loon, anyway,\" said the engineer, much as one might pass\nthe time of day. \"They'd ought to have sense enough to take his gun\naway from him.\"\n\nJeffard explained in a sentence. \"It wasn't the crazy one; it was one\nof the two cut-throats who are kidnaping him--the fellows I'm trying\nto beat.\"\n\n\"The fellers you're goin' to beat,\" corrected the engineer. \"We'll head\n'em off now if the Ninety-seven goes in on three legs. The gall o' the\ncusses!--why, they might ha' shot somebody!\"\n\nFrom the crossing in the lower valley neither line encounters any\nspecial obstacle to speed; and under equal conditions a locomotive race\nup the Roaring Fork might be an affair of seconds and rail lengths\nfor the victor. But the light engine with regardless orders speedily\ndistanced the passenger train with stops to make; and when the smokes\nof the mountain-girt town at the head of the valley came in sight, the\nbig engineer pulled his watch and shouted triumphant:--\n\n\"Eleven-forty,--and their time's twelve-five. We'll be twenty minutes\nto the good in spite o'\"--\n\nIt is conceivable that he would have used a strong figure, but the\ndepravity of things inanimate took the word out of his mouth. There\nwas a tearing crash to the rear; a shock as if a huge projectile had\novertaken them; and the flying locomotive came to earth like an eagle\nwith a mangled wing. It was a broken axle under the tender; a tested\nsteel shaft which had outlived the pounding race across the mountains\nonly to fall apart in the last level mile of the home stretch. Jeffard\nclambered down with the enginemen, and saw defeat, crushing and\ndefinite, in the wreck under the tender. But the big engineer was a man\nfor a crisis. One glance at the wreck sufficed, and the fireman got his\norders in shot-like sentences.\n\n\"Up with you, Tom, and give her the water,--both injectors! Drop me the\nsledge, and get the pinch-bar under the head o' that couplin'-pin when\nI drive it up. Give her a scoop 'r two o' coal--'nough to run in with.\nBy cripes! we'll beat 'em yet!\"\n\nThe minced oath came from beneath the engine, and was punctuated by\nmighty upward blows of the sledge hammer on the coupling-pin, whose\nhead was rising by half-inch impulses from its seat in the footplate.\nJeffard saw and understood. The engineer meant to cut loose from the\nwreck and finish the run without the tender.\n\n\"Use me if you can,\" he offered. \"What shall I do?\"\n\n\"Climb up there and help Tom with that bar. If we can pull this pin\nwe're in it yet.\"\n\nJeffard laid hold with the fireman, and together they pried at the\nreluctant pin. It yielded at length, but when the engineer had\ndisconnected the water and air hose and mounted to his place in the\ncab, the roar of the oncoming passenger train was ajar in the air.\n\n\"You stay with the wreck, Tom, and flag it!\" was the final command; and\nthen to Jeffard, as the engine shot away from its disabled member: \"How\nmuch time have you got to have?\"\n\n\"I don't know. It depends upon how much those fellows have found out,\nand how drunk my partner is. At the worst, a minute or two will serve.\"\n\nIt was still to be had, but in the very yard a thrown switch\nintervened, and the small margin vanished. The passenger train was in,\nand Jeffard saw defeat again; but he dropped from the locomotive and\nran up the yard, forgetting in the heat of it that he had elided two\nmeals in the twenty-four hours. The final dash brought its reward. He\ntook the first vehicle that offered and reached the principal hotel\nin time to see Garvin and his keepers descend from a carriage at the\nentrance.\n\n\"Yes, sir; in one moment. Those three fellows who came in just now?\nThey've gone up to their room. Be with us over night?\"\n\nThus the hotel clerk in answer to Jeffard's gasping inquiry. To whom\nthe proletary, fighting desperately for some semblance of equanimity:--\n\n\"I--I'll be here indefinitely; no, I have no baggage; I'll pay in\nadvance. Can you give me the room next to these men? The crazy one is\nmy partner, and I'll be responsible for him.\"\n\nThe clerk hesitated, but Jeffard won his cause without knowing it by\nthe necessary parade of bank-notes in the pecuniary affair.\n\n\"Certainly, sir; the boy will show you up. You won't trouble him? All\nright; Number Nineteen--second floor, third door to the right. Dinner\nis served, when you're ready.\"\n\nIf Jeffard had forgotten his directions the uproar in Number Eighteen\nwould have guided him. Garvin's voice, uplifted in alternate\nmalediction and maudlin bathos, jarred upon the air of the corridor.\nJeffard paused. The long chase was ended and only a pine door\nintervened between pursuer and pursued. He laid a hand on the doorknob.\nHis breath came hard, and the veins in his forehead were like knotted\nwhipcords. While he paused some broken babblings from within wrought\na swift change in him. The knotted veins relaxed and he laughed, not\nmirthfully but with a cynical upcurve of the lip. His hand slipped from\nthe doorknob, and he stole away, cat-like, to let himself noiselessly\ninto the adjoining room.\n\nThere was a door of communication between the two rooms, bolted on\nJeffard's side, and with the knob removed. He went on his knees to\nthe square hole through the lock, but the angle of vision included no\nmore than a blank patch of the opposite wall. Then he laid his ear\nto the aperture. Out of the jangling discord beyond the door came\nfragmentary lucidities pieceable together into a strand of sequence.\nGarvin had told all he knew, or all he could remember, and the robbery\npaused at the trivial detail of the most feasible route over the\nmountains from Aspen. But to make sure, and possibly to provide against\nthe contingency of having to eliminate Garvin, some rude map was\nneeded; and this one of the plunderers was evidently trying to draw\nunder instructions from the witling. At the mention of a map, Jeffard\nrummaged his pockets without taking his ear from the door. From one of\nthem he drew a crumpled bit of paper, thumbed and crease-broken. It was\nGarvin's map of the claim and the trail, passed over for inspection\nin the hollow of a certain lambent evening months before and never\nreturned.\n\nWho shall say what was behind the inscrutable darkling of the eyes of\nhim when he returned the paper to his pocket and bent to listen with\nfour senses lending their acuteness to the fifth? Was it a softening\nmemory of the loving-kindnesses of one James Garvin to a man soul-sick\nand body-wasted, snatched as a charred brand out of a fire of his own\nkindling? Or was it the stirring of a ruthless devil of self; a devil\nnever more than dormant in any heart insurgent; a fell demon of the pit\nwhose arousing waits only upon opportunity, whose power is to transform\npity into remorseless ingratitude and ruth into relentless greed? There\nwas room for the alternative.\n\n\"Here; take another nip o' this and pull yourself together,\"--it was\nthe voice of the hawk-faced one. \"If you wasn't such a howlin' idiot\nyou'd see that we're the only friends you've got. I keep a-tellin' you\nthat that slick pardner o' yours was on that wild ingine, and if you\ndon't sink a shaft on your wits he's a-goin' to do you up cold!\"\n\nThe appeal brought blood as a blow. The crash of an overturned chair\nwas followed by an explosion of cursings, the outcries of a soul in\ntorment. And when the madman choked in the fullness of it, a voice\nsaid: \"Pick up that chair, Pete, and pull him down. He'll be seein'\nthings in a minute, and that'll settle the whole shootin'-match.\" There\nwas a struggle short but violent, the jar of a forcible downsetting,\nand a sound as of one flinging his arms abroad upon the table. After\nwhich the tormented one became brokenly articulate. What he said is\nunrecordable. With maudlin oath and thick-tongued ravings he rehearsed\nhis fancied wrongs and breathed forth promises of vengeance, calling\ndown the wrath of the spheres upon one Henry Jeffard and his posterity\nto the third and fourth generation.\n\n\"That's all right; I'd kill him on sight, if I was you. But just now\nyou're killin' time, instid. First you know, he'll be on his way acrost\nthe range, and then where'll you be? You don't even know that he didn't\nlocate that claim before you came out. Git down to business and tell us\nwhere that valley is, if you ever knowed. You said it was on a creek\"--\n\nJeffard rose and went softly across the room to sit on the edge of the\nbed. The unfathomable light was still in his eyes, and his thought\nwrought itself into words.\n\n\"It's done; they'll wring it out of him, and then fling him aside like\nso much offal. I wonder if it is worth while to try to save it--for\nhim. What good would it do him?--or, rather, what evil thing is there\nthat it wouldn't make possible for him? What devil of curiosity led\nme to open this Pandora-box of responsibility? For I am responsible,\nfirst for the finding, and now for the keeping, and hereafter for what\nshall come of it. That is, if I save it--for him.\" He got upon his feet\nand tiptoed back to the door of communication, listening once more.\nThe clamor had quieted down, and the scratching of a pen gnawed the\nsilence. Then came the voice of the hawk-faced one.\n\n\"There she is; you sign your name right there and it'll be all right.\nIt's the only way; you're too drunk to pull strings with that pardner\no' yours, and we're goin' to stand by you, see? All we want is the\nauthority.\"\n\nJeffard started back and made as if he would fling himself against the\nlocked door. Then he thought better of it.\n\n\"That simplifies it,\" he mused, pacing up and down with noiseless\nsteps. \"He has signed away whatever right he had, and now it's my turn.\nIf I pay the price I can checkmate them. But can I pay the price?\nSurely, if any man can; I, who have deliberately turned my back upon\nthe world's approval for a much less thing. And in the end the money\nwill atone.\"\n\nA stir in the adjoining room admonished him that the time for action\nhad come. He wheeled quickly and let himself into the corridor. A key\nwas rattling in the lock of Number Eighteen as he passed, but he found\nthe stair before the bolt was shot. In the lobby he stopped to ask\na hurried question of a man who was opening his mail at the public\nwriting-table. The question was answered curtly, but the man left his\nletters and went to the door to point the reply.\n\n\"I see it; thank you,\" said Jeffard; and went his way rapidly, with\nnow and then a glance behind him as if to make sure that he was not\nfollowed.\n\nIn a few minutes he came back, walking slowly, with his head down and\nhis hands in the pockets of the brown duck miner's coat. There was a\nknot of loungers in front of the hotel, gathered about the door and\npeering in; a group of curious ones, which grew by accretions from the\nby-passers. A disturbance of some sort was afoot in the lobby--two\npersuasive ones struggling peaceably with a drunken man, while the\nbystanders looked on with smiles pitying or cynical, each after his\nkind.\n\nJeffard pushed into the circle, and those who remarked him said that he\nseemed to see nothing but the struggling trio. Some of the onlookers\nwere near enough to hear what he said to the two who were not drunk.\n\n\"The game is closed, gentlemen, and you are out of it. When you get on\nthe ground you will find the claim located--in my name.\"\n\nTwo right hands made simultaneous backward dips, and two potential\nmurderers apparently realized the folly of it at the same instant. But\nthe drunken one spun around with his face ablaze, a fiercer madness\nthan that of drink burning in his bloodshot eyes.\n\n\"You? You played the sneak an' located hit behind my back? In your\nname, d' ye say?--your name? Well, by God, you hain't got a name!\"\n\nA pistol cracked with the oath, and Jeffard put his hands to his head\nand pitched forward. The crowd fell back aghast, to surge inward again\nwith a rush when the reaction came. Then a shout was raised at the\ndoor, and the haggard manslayer, cured now of all madness save that of\nfear, burst through the inpressing throng and disappeared.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nEVEN in a Colorado mining town a shooting affray at midday in the lobby\nof the principal hotel creates more or less of a sensation, and it\nwas fully fifteen minutes before the buzz of public comment subsided\nsufficiently to suffer Mr. Mark Denby to go back to his letters and\ntelegrams. He had made one in the circle of onlookers; had seen and\nheard, and, now that the wounded man had been carried to his room and\ncared for, and the hunt was up and afield for the would-be murderer,\nwas willing to forget. But a traveling salesman at the opposite\nblotting-pad must needs keep the pool astir.\n\n\"Say, wasn't that the most cold-blooded thing you ever saw? 'Y gad!\nI've heard that these Western towns were fearfully tough, but I had\nno idea a man wouldn't be safe to sit down and write his house in the\nlobby of a decent hotel. 'Pon my word, I actually heard the 'zip' of\nthat bullet!\"\n\nDenby looked across at the hinderer of oblivion, and remembered that\nthe salesman had been well to the rear of the battery in action.\nWherefore he said, with a touch of the gravest irony: \"You'll get used\nto it, after a bit. Suppose you take a spin around the block in the\nopen air; that will doubtless steady your nerves so you can write the\nhouse without a quiver.\"\n\n\"Think it would? I believe I'll try it; I can't hold a pen still to\nsave my life. But say, I might happen to run up against that fellow,\nand he might recognize me and think I was after him.\"\n\n\"In which case he would in all probability draw and quarter you and\ntake your scalp for a memento. On second thought, I don't know but\nyou're safer where you are.\"\n\nThe mere suggestion was perspiratory, and the traveling man mopped\nhis face. But there are occasions when one must talk or burst, and\npresently he began again.\n\n\"Say, I suppose they'll lynch that fellow if they catch him, won't\nthey?\"\n\nThe badgered one came to attention with a fine-lined frown of annoyance\nradiating fan-like above his eyes. He was of the stuff of which\nman-masters are made; a well-knit figure of a man, rather under than\nover the average of height and breadth, but so fairly proportioned as\nto give the impression of unmeasured strength in reserve,--the strength\nof steel under silk. His face was bronzed with the sun-stain of the\naltitudes, but it was as smooth as a child's, and beardless, with thin\nlips and masterful eyes of the sort that can look unmoved upon things\nunnamable.\n\n\"Lynch him? Oh, no; you do us an injustice,\" he said, and the tone was\nquite as level as the eye-volley. \"We don't lynch people out here for\nshooting,--only for talking too much.\"\n\nWhereat one may picture unacclimated loquacity gasping and silenced,\nwith the owner of the \"Chincapin\" and other listed properties going\non to read his letters and telegrams in peace. The process furthered\nitself in the sequence of well-ordered dispatch until a message, damp\nfrom the copying-press and dated at Leadville, came to the surface. It\ncovered two of the yellow sheets in the spacious handwriting of the\nreceiving operator, and Denby read it twice, and yet once again, before\nlaying it aside. Whatever it was, it was not suffered to interrupt the\norderly sequence of things; and Denby had read the last of the letters\nbefore he held up a summoning finger for a bell-boy.\n\n\"Go and ask the clerk the name of the man who was shot, will you?\"\n\nThe information came in two words, and the querist gathered up his\npapers and sent the boy for his room key. At the stairhead he met the\nsurgeon and stopped him to ask about the wounded man.\n\n\"How are you, Doctor? What is the verdict? Is there a fighting chance\nfor him?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; much more than that. It isn't as bad as it might have been;\nthe skull isn't fractured. But it was enough to knock him out under the\ncircumstances. He had skipped two or three meals, he tells me, and was\nunder a pretty tense strain of excitement.\"\n\n\"Then he is conscious?\"\n\nThe physician laughed. \"Very much so. He is sitting up to take my\nprescription,--which was a square meal. Whatever the strain was, it\nisn't off yet. He insists that he must mount and ride this afternoon\nif he has to be lashed in the saddle; has already ordered a horse, in\nfact. He is plucky.\"\n\n\"Then he is able to talk business, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Able, yes; but if you can get anything out of him, you'll do better\nthan I could. He won't talk,--won't even tell what the row was about.\"\n\n\"Won't he?\" The man of affairs crossed the corridor and tapped on the\ndoor of Number Nineteen. There was no response, and he turned the knob\nand entered. The shades were drawn and there was a cleanly odor of\naseptics in the air of the darkened room. The wounded man was propped\namong pillows on the bed, with a well-furnished tea-tray on his knees.\nHe gave prompt evidence of his ability to talk.\n\n\"Back again, are you? I told you I had nothing to say for publication,\nand I meant it.\" This wrathfully; then he discovered his mistake,\nbut the tone of the careless apology was scarcely more conciliatory.\n\"Oh--excuse me. I thought it was the reporter.\"\n\nBartrow's correspondent found a chair and introduced himself with\ncharitable directness. \"My name is Denby. I am here because Mr. Richard\nBartrow wires me to look you up.\"\n\nJeffard delayed the knife and fork play long enough to say:\n\"Denby?--oh, yes; I remember. Thank you,\" and there the interview bade\nfair to die of inanition. Jeffard went on with his dinner as one who\neats to live; and Denby tilted his chair gently and studied his man as\nwell as he might in the twilight of the drawn shades. After a time, he\nsaid:--\n\n\"Bartrow bespeaks my help for you. He says your affair may need\nexpediting: does it?\"\n\nJeffard's rejoinder was almost antagonistic. \"How much do you know of\nthe affair?\"\n\n\"What the whole town knows by this time--added to what little Bartrow\ntells me in his wire. You or your partner have stumbled upon an\nabandoned claim which promises to be a bonanza. One of you--public\nrumor is a little uncertain as to which one--tried to euchre the other;\nand it seems that you have won in the race to the Recorder's office,\nand have come out of it alive. Is that the summary?\"\n\nHe called it public rumor, but it was rather a shrewd guess. Jeffard\ndid not hasten to confirm it. On the contrary, his reply was evasive.\n\n\"You may call it an hypothesis--a working hypothesis, if you choose.\nWhat then?\"\n\nThe promoter was not of those who swerve from conclusions. \"It follows\nthat you are a stout fighter, and a man to be helped, or a very great\nrascal,\" he said coolly.\n\nAgain the knife and fork paused, and the wounded man's gaze was at\nleast as steady as that of his conditional accuser. \"It may simplify\nmatters, Mr. Denby, if I say that I expect nothing from public rumor.\"\n\nThe mine-owner shrugged his shoulders as an unwilling arbiter who\nwould fain wash his hands of the ethical entanglement if he could.\n\n\"It's your own affair, of course,--the public opinion part of it. But\nit may prove to be worth your while not to ignore the suffrages of\nthose who make and unmake reputations.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because you will need capital,--honest capital,--and\"--\n\nHe left the sentence in the air, and Jeffard brought it down with a\ncynical stonecast.\n\n\"And, under the circumstances, an honest capitalist might hesitate,\nyou would say. Possibly; but capital, as I know it, is not so\ndiscriminating when the legal requirements are satisfied. There will be\nno question of ownership involved in the development of the 'Midas.'\"\n\n\"Legal ownership, you mean?\"\n\n\"Legal or otherwise. When the time for investment comes, I shall be\nabundantly able to assure the capitalist.\"\n\n\"To guarantee the investment: doubtless. But capital is not always as\nunscrupulous as you seem to think.\"\n\n\"No?\"--the tilt of the negative was almost aggressive. \"There are\nborrowers and borrowers, Mr. Denby. It's the man without collateral who\nis constrained to make a confidant of his banker.\"\n\nThe blue-gray eyes of the master of men looked their levelest, and the\nclean-shaven face was shrewdly inscrutable. \"Pardon me, Mr. Jeffard,\nbut there are men who couldn't borrow with the Orizaba behind them.\"\n\nJeffard parried the eye-thrust, and brushed the generalities aside in a\nsentence.\n\n\"All of which is beside the mark, and I have neither the strength nor\nthe inclination to flail it out with you. As you say, I shall need\ncapital--yours or another's. State the case--yours, or mine,--in so\nmany words, if you please.\"\n\n\"Briefly, then: the equity in this affair lies between you and the man\nwho tried to kill you. I mean by this that the bonanza is either yours\nor his. If it were a partnership discovery there would have been no\nchance for one of you to overreach the other. You'll hardly deny that\nthere was a sharp fight for possession: you both advertised that fact\npretty liberally.\"\n\nJeffard was listening with indifference, real or feigned, and he\nneither denied nor affirmed. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"From the point of view of an unprejudiced observer the evidence is\nagainst your partner. He comes here drunk and abusive, in company with\ntwo men whose faces would condemn them anywhere, and squanders his lead\nin the race in a supplementary carouse. And a little later, when he\nfinds that you have outclassed him, he shoots you down like a dog in a\nfit of drunken fury. To an impartial onlooker the inference is fairly\nobvious.\"\n\n\"And that is?\"--\n\n\"That your partner is the scoundrel; that the discovery is yours,\nand that he and his accomplices were trying to rob you. I don't mind\nsaying that this is my own inference, but I shall be glad to have it\nconfirmed.\"\n\nJeffard looked up quickly. \"Then Bartrow hasn't told you\"--\n\n\"Bartrow's message was merely introductory; two pages of eulogy, in\nfact, as any friendly office of Dick's is bound to be. He doesn't go\ninto details.\"\n\nJeffard put the tea-tray aside and with it the air of abstraction, and\nin a better light his interlocutor would not have failed to remark the\nswift change from dubiety to assurance.\n\n\"Will you bear with me, Mr. Denby, if I say that your methods are a\nlittle indirect? You say that the evidence is against James Garvin,\nand yet you give me to understand that it will be well if I can clear\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Exactly; a word of assurance is sometimes worth many deductions.\"\n\n\"But if, for reasons of my own, I refuse to say the word?\"\n\nThe promoter's shrug was barely perceptible. \"I don't see why you\nshould refuse.\"\n\nJeffard went silent at that, lying back with closed eyes and no more\nthan a twitching of the lips to show that he was not asleep. After what\nseemed an interminable interval to the mine-owner, he said:--\n\n\"I do refuse, for the present. A few days later, when I have done what\nI have to do, there will be time enough to discuss ways and means--and\nethics, if you still feel inclined that way. May I trouble you to\nrun that window-shade up?\" He was sitting on the edge of the bed and\ngroping beneath it for his shoes.\n\nThe promoter admitted the light and ventured a question.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"Get on the ground with the least possible delay.\"\n\nThe shoes were found, but when the wounded one bent to lace them the\nroom spun around and he would have fallen if Denby had not caught him.\n\n\"You're not fit,\" said the master of men, not unsympathetically. \"You\ncouldn't sit a horse if your life depended upon it.\"\n\n\"I must; therefore I can and will,\" Jeffard asserted, with fine\ndetermination. \"Be good enough to ask the bell-boy to come in and lace\nmy shoes.\"\n\nThe man with a mission to compel other men smiled. His fetish was\nindomitable resolution, for himself first, and afterward for those who\ndeserved; and here was a man who, whatever his lacks and havings in\nthe ethical field, was at least courageous. Having admitted so much,\nthe promoter went down on one knee to lace the courageous one's shoes,\ndissuading him, meanwhile.\n\n\"You can't go to-day; the wound-fever will come on presently, and\nyou'll be a sick man. Let it rest a while. Having put himself on the\ncriminal side of the fence by trying to kill you, your partner will\nhardly dare to jump the claim in person; he will have to find a proxy,\nand that will ask for time,--more time than the sheriff-dodging will\npermit.\"\n\n\"His proxies are here, and they will act without instructions from\nhim,\" said Jeffard, with his hands to his head and his teeth set to\nkeep the words from shaping themselves into a groan.\n\n\"You mean the two who were with him?\"\n\n\"Yes. So far as the present fight is concerned, the three are one; and\ntwo of them are still free to act.\"\n\n\"So?--that's different.\" Denby finished tying the second shoe and rose\nto begin measuring a sentinel's beat between the window and the door,\npacing evenly with his brows knitted and his hands clasped behind him.\n\"You know what to expect, then?\"\n\n\"I know that I have been twice shot at within the past two hours, and\nthat the moments are golden.\"\n\n\"But you are in no condition to go in and hold it alone! You'll have to\nmeet force with force. You ought to have at least three or four good\nmen with you.\"\n\n\"What I have to do presupposes a clear field,\" said Jeffard guardedly.\n\"If it should come to blows, the discussion of--of ethics will be\nindefinitely postponed, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"Humph! I suppose your reasons are as strong as your obstinacy. How far\nis it to your claim?\"\n\n\"I don't know the exact distance; about twenty miles, I believe. But\nthere is a mountain range intervening.\"\n\n\"You can't ride it in your present condition; it's a sheer physical\nimpossibility.\"\n\n\"I shall ride it.\"\n\n\"What is the use of being an ass?\" demanded the master of men, losing\npatience for once in a way. \"Don't you see you can't stand alone?\"\n\nJeffard struggled to his feet and wavered across the room to a chair.\nDenby laughed,--a quiet little chuckle of appreciation.\n\n\"I didn't mean literally; I meant in the business affair. You'll\nhave to have help from the start. That means that you will have to\ntrust some one. From what you say it is evident that there will be\nan immediate attempt made to jump the claim; an attempt which will\nbe afoot and on the ground long before you can get there. Let us be\nreasonable and take hold of the live facts. I have a man here who is\nboth capable and trustworthy. Let me send him in with a sufficient\nforce to stand off the jumpers until you are able to hold your own.\"\n\nJeffard shook his head. \"I can't do it, unreasonable as it may seem. I\nmust go first and alone. That is another mystery, you will say, but I\ncan't help it. If I win through it alive I shall be here again in a day\nor two, ready to talk business. More than that I can't say now.\"\n\nDenby's thin lips came together in a straight line, with a click of the\nwhite teeth behind them. \"As you please. I am not going about to prove\nto you that you would lose nothing by trusting me from the start. Can I\ndo anything toward helping you off?\"\n\n\"Yes; you can give me your shoulder down the stair and a lift into the\nsaddle.\"\n\nThe little journey to the ground floor was made in silence. When they\nwere passing the desk the clerk said: \"Your horse is at the door, Mr.\nJeffard. I was just about to send up word. Are you feeling better?\"\n\n\"I am all right.\" He leaned heavily on the counter and paid his bill.\n\"Did the liveryman leave any message?\"\n\n\"No, only to say that he has stocked the saddle-bags as you directed.\"\n\nThe personally conducted journey went on to the sidewalk, and Denby\nheaved the wounded one into the saddle, steadying him therein till the\nvertigo loosed its hold.\n\n\"Anything else you can delegate?\"\n\n\"No, thank you; nothing that I think of.\"\n\n\"You are still determined to go?\"\n\n\"Quite determined.\"\n\n\"Well, you are a stubborn madman, and I rather like you for it; that's\nall I have to say. Good luck to you.\"\n\nJeffard gathered the reins and sat reflective what time the broncho\nsniffed the cool breeze pouring down from the higher slopes of the\nwestern range. When the horse would have set out, Jeffard restrained\nhim yet another moment.\n\n\"You intimated a few minutes ago that I was afraid to trust you, Mr.\nDenby,\" he said, picking and choosing among the words as one who has\na difficult course to steer. \"I do trust you as far as I can trust\nany one at the present crisis, and I'll prove it.\" He drew a crumpled\nbit of paper from his pocket, and smoothed it upon the pommel of the\nsaddle. \"Here is a rough map of the claim and the trails by which it\nmay be reached. If I'm not back in Aspen in three days, fit out your\nexpedition and go in prepared to take and hold the property. The men\nyou will find in possession will be robbers,--and murderers,--and you\nmay have to fight for it; but that won't matter. In the right-hand\ntunnel wall, a few feet from the entrance, you will see a crevice where\nthe dynamite was kept. In the bottom of that crevice you'll find my\nlast will and testament, and I'm going to believe that you will carry\nout its provisions to the letter.\"\n\nThe promoter's smile was of grimness, with quarterings of approval.\n\n\"Which is to say that you'll be safely dead and buried. Barring your\nidiotic stubbornness, you are a man after my own heart, Mr. Jeffard,\nand I'll willingly be your executor. Are you armed?\"\n\n\"No; I told you it would depend upon speed. I have no weapons.\"\n\n\"What! And you are going on a forlorn hope with an even chance of\nhaving to fight for your life? Wait a minute.\"\n\nHe ran back into the hotel, coming out again presently with a repeating\nrifle and a well-filled cartridge belt. \"There is such a thing as\ncold nerve carried to the vanishing point in foolhardiness, Mr.\nJeffard,\" he said. \"Put this belt on while I sling the rifle under the\nsaddle-flap. Can you shoot straight?\"\n\n\"It is extremely doubtful. A little target practice as a boy\"--\n\n\"Target practice!--and you may have to stand off a gang of desperadoes\nwho can clip coins at a hundred yards! You'd better reconsider and give\nme time to organize a posse.\"\n\n\"No; thank you--for that and everything else. Good-by.\"\n\nDenby stood on the curb and watched his man ride slowly up the street\nand take the turn toward the southern mountains. After which he went\nback to his place at the public writing-table in the lobby, picking\nup the hotel stenographer on the way. For a preoccupied half-hour he\ndictated steadily, and when the last letter was answered got up to pace\nout the transcribing interval. In the midst of it he drifted out to the\nsidewalk and stood staring absently up the street, as, an hour earlier,\nhe had gazed after the lessening figure of the obstinate one. But this\ntime there were two horsemen in the field of vision wending their\nway leisurely to the street-end. Denby, thinking pointedly of other\nthings, saw them and saw them not; but when they, too, took the turn to\nthe southward, he came alive to the probabilities in the heart of an\ninstant.\n\n\"By all that's good!--they're after him, as sure as fate!\" he muttered;\nand a little later he was quizzing the proprietor of a livery stable\naround the corner.\n\n\"Do you know those two fellows who have just left, Thompson?\"\n\n\"You bet I don't; and I made 'em put up the collateral for the whole\noutfit before they got away.\"\n\n\"Where did you say they were going?\"\n\n\"Didn't say, did I? But somewheres up Jackfoot Gulch was what they told\nme.\"\n\n\"H'm; that is east. And just now they are riding in another direction.\nYou sold them the horses, you say?\"\n\nThe man grinned. \"Temp'rarily. I'll take 'em back at the same price,\nless the tariff, if I ever see 'em again. I ain't takin' no chances on\nstray strangers with any such lookin'-glass-bustin' faces as they've\ngot. Not much, Mary Ann.\"\n\n\"It is well to be careful. Have you seen my man Donald since dinner?\"\n\n\"Yes; he was here just now and said he'd be back again. Want him?\"\n\nDenby looked at his watch. \"Yes. If he doesn't come back within five\nminutes, send some of the boys out to hunt him up. Tell him to outfit\nfor himself and me for two days, and to be at the hotel at three,\nsharp. Give him the best horses you can lay your hands on.\"\n\n\"Always yours to command, Mr. Denby. Anything else?\"\n\n\"That's all.\"\n\nThe promoter left the stable and walked quickly to the hotel. At the\nentrance he met an acquaintance and stopped to pass the time of day.\n\n\"How are you, Roberts?--By the way, you are just the man I wanted to\nsee; saves me a trip to the Court House. Did a fellow named Jeffard,\nJ-e-f-f-a-r-d, file a notice and affidavit on a claim called the\n'Midas' just after dinner?\"\n\n\"No. He came over to ask me if there was any way in which he could\nsecure himself. It seems that he neglected to post a notice on the\nclaim before coming out with his samples,--why, he didn't explain.\"\n\nDenby nodded and went on, talking to himself. \"So!--that's his little\nmystery, is it? The 'Midas' isn't located yet, and until he gets that\nnotice posted and recorded, it's anybody's bonanza. I hope Donald can\npick up the trail and follow it. If he can't, there'll be one plucky\nfellow less in the world, and two more thugs to be hanged, later on.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nA TOPOGRAPHICAL map of that portion of the Saguache known as the\nElk Mountain Range--the spur which forms the watershed between the\nGunnison and the Grand--will include a primeval valley gashing the\nrange southeastward from Tourtelotte on the Ashcroft trail, and heading\nfifteen miles farther wildernessward in a windswept pass across the\nsummit of the watershed. Its watercourse, a tumbling torrent fed by\nthe melting snows in the higher gulches, is a tributary of the Roaring\nFork; and a disused pack-trail, which once served a scattered pioneer\ncorps of prospectors, climbs by tortuous stages to the windswept pass,\nnow swerving from bank to bank of the stream, and now heading a lateral\ngulch or crossing the point of a barrier spur.\n\nIt is a crystalline afternoon in mid-autumn. Indian summer on the\nhigh plateaus of the continent's crest there is none, but instead,\na breathing space of life-giving days, with the bouquet of fine old\nwine in the keen-edged air, and of frosty nights when the stars swing\nclear in illimitable space. Positive coloring, other than the sombre\ngreens of pine and fir, is lacking. The season of bursting buds and\nquickening leaf tints is over, and what little deciduous vegetation the\naltitude permits is present only in twig traceries and sun-cured range\ngrass. In the heart of the valley the heights are heavily wooded, and\nthe sombre greens wall out the world to the sky-line; but farther on\nbald slopes and ridges stretch away above the pines and firs, and the\nblue arch of the firmament springs clear from snow-capped abutments of\nfallow dun and weathered gray.\n\nIn the upper levels of the valley the disused trail leaves the stream\nand begins to climb by loops and zigzags to the pass. On the reverse\ncurve of one of the loops--the last but one in the upward path--a\nsolitary horseman sends his mount recklessly onward, heedless alike\nof stones of stumbling and the breath-cutting steepness of the way.\nHis head is bandaged, and he rides loose in the saddle like a drunken\nman, swaying and reeling, but evermore urging the horse by word and\nblow and the drumming of unspurred heels. His feet are thrust far into\nthe stirrups, and at every fresh vantage point he steadies himself by\npommel and cantle to scan the backward windings of the trail. A man\nriding desperately for his life and against time, with a handicap of\nphysical unfitness, one would say; but there would seem to be fierce\ndetermination in the unrelenting onpush, as if wounds and weariness\nwere as yet no more than spurs to goad and whips to drive.\n\nThe reverse curve of the loop ends on the crest of the last of the\nbarrier spurs, and at the crown of the ascent the forest thins to right\nand left, opening a longer backward vista. On the bare summit the\nrider turns once more in his saddle, and the rearward glance becomes a\nsteady eye-sweep. In the bight of the loop which he has just traversed\nthe trail swings clear of the gulch timber, and while he gazes two\ndark objects advancing abreast and alternately rising and falling to\na distance-softened staccato of pounding hoofs cross the open space\nand double the loop. The wounded one measures his lead. For all his\nspurrings the distance is decreasing; and a hasty survey of the trail\nahead is not reassuring. From the bald summit of the spur the bridle\npath winds around the head of another gulch, and the approach to the\npass on the farther side is a snow-banked incline, above timber line,\nuncovered, and within easy rifle-shot of the hill of reconnaissance.\nWhat will befall is measurably certain. If he attempts to head the\ntraversing ravine on the trail, his pursuers will reach the bald\nsummit, wait, and pick him off at their leisure while he is scaling the\nopposite snowbank.\n\nAt the second glance a dubious alternative offers. The gorge in the\ndirect line may not prove impassable; there is a slender chance that\none may push straight across and up the opposing slope to the pass\nbefore the guns of the enemy can be brought into position. Wherefore\nhe sends the horse at a reckless gallop down the descent to the gorge,\nmaking shift to cling with knee and heel while he disengages a rifle\nfrom its sling under the saddle-flap, and fills its magazine with\ncartridges from a belt at his waist.\n\nAt the bottom of the ravine the alternative vanishes; becomes a thing\ninexistent, in fact. The gorge in its lower length is a canyoned slit,\na barrier to be passed only by creatures with wings. To return is\nto meet his pursuers on the bald summit of the spur; to hesitate is\nequally hazardous. The horse obeys the sudden wrenching of the rein,\nspins as on a pivot, and darts away up the canyon brink. Fortunately,\nthe timber is sparse, and, luckily again, a practicable crossing is\nfound well within the longer detour traced by the trail. For the second\ntime that day it is a race to the swift; and, as before, an accident\ncomes between. Horse and man are across the ravine, are clear of the\nstunted firs, are mounting the final snow-banked incline to the pass\nwith no more than a trooper's dash between them and safety, when the\nsure-footed beast slips on the packed snow of the trail, and horse and\nman roll together to the bottom of the declivity.\n\nA few hours earlier this man had been the football of circumstances,\ntossed hither and yon as the buffetings of chance might impel him. But\nthe pregnant hours have wrought a curious change in him, for better or\nworse, and before the breath-cutting plunge is checked he is free of\nthe struggling horse and is kicking it to its feet to mount and ride\nagain, charging the steep uprising with plying lash and digging heels\nand shouts of encouragement. Ten seconds later the trail is regained\nand the summit of the pass cuts the sky-line above him. Ten other\nflying leaps and a resolute man may hold an army at bay. But in the\nmidst of them comes a clatter of hoofs on the rocky headland across the\ngulch, and a nerve-melting instant wherein the hoof-beats cease and the\nbleak heights give back a muffled echo in the rarefied air. The hunted\none bends to the saddle-horn at the crack of the rifle, and the bullet\nsings high. A second is better aimed, and at the shrill hiss of it the\nsnorting horse flattens its ears and lunges at the ascent with flagging\npowers fear-revived. A scrambling bound or two and the final height is\ngained, but in the pivoting instant between danger and safety a third\nbullet scores the horse's back and embeds itself in the cantle of the\nsaddle with a benumbing shock to the rider.\n\nBut by this the fugitive is fair Berserk-mad, and those who would stay\nhim must shoot to kill. Once out of range beyond the crest of the pass,\nhe drags the trembling horse to its haunches and whips down from the\nsaddle, the wine of battle singing in his veins and red wrath answering\nfor physical fitness. A hasty glance to make sure that the broncho's\nwound is not disabling, and he is back at the summit of the pass,\nsheltering himself behind a rock and sending shot after shot across\nthe ravine at his assailants. The fusillade is harmless; wounds, mad\ngallops, and red wrath being easily subversive of accuracy in target\npractice; but it has the effect of sending the enemy to the rear in\ndiscreet haste, with the dropping shots beating quick time for the\ndouble quartette of trampling hoofs as the twain gallop out of range\nbehind the bald headland.\n\nFor a resolute half-hour, while the undertow of the ebbing minutes\nsteadily undermines the props and shores set up by Berserk wrath, the\nsolitary rifleman lies watchful and vigilant. Thrice in that interval\nhave the attackers rallied; once in a desperate charge to gain the\ncover of the timber on the canyon's brink, and twice in equally\ndesperate efforts to turn the rifleman's position by following the\nlooping of the trail. Notwithstanding the bad marksmanship of the\ngarrison the position has proved--still proves--impregnable; and the\nend of the half-hour leaguer finds the intrenched one secure in his\nposition, with the enemy in permanent check, and only his own waning\nstrength to warn him that the pass cannot be held indefinitely.\n\nBut this warning is imperative, as is that other of the fast westering\nsun; and when a movement on the opposite height gives him one more\nchance to announce volley-wise that the pass is still manned, he\nretreats swiftly, remounts after more than one exhaustive effort, and\ncanters down the farther windings of the trail into a valley shut in on\nall sides by snow-coifed sentinel mountains, and with a brawling stream\nplunging through its midst; into this valley and down the length of it\nto a narrowing of the stream path, where a rude cabin, with its door\nhanging awry, looks across from the heel of the western cliff to the\ngray dump of a tunnel-opening in the opposite mountain side.\n\nThe sun has already set for the lower slopes of the shut-in valley, and\nthe frosty breath of the snow-capped sentinel peaks is in the air.\nAt the door of the cabin the winner in the desperate race slides from\nthe saddle. His knees are quaking, and because of them he stumbles and\nfalls over the log doorstone, cursing his helplessness in the jolt\nof it. But there remains much to be done, and the sunset glories are\nchanging from crimson and dusky gold on the snow-caps to royal purple\nin the shadow of the western cliff.\n\nWith many slippings and stumblings he crosses the foot-log and climbs\nto the level of the tunnel-opening opposite, constraining the unwilling\nhorse to follow. With a stone for a hammer he tacks a square of paper\non one of the struts of the timbered entrance; and after another\nstruggle feebly fierce the horse is dragged into the low-browed cavern\nand tethered out of harm's way. By the leaden-footed step of the man\none would say that the last reserves of determination have been called\nin and are far spent; but he will not desist. With four stakes taken\nfrom the heap of wooden treenails used in the tunnel timbering he drags\nhimself from corner to corner of the claim, pacing its boundaries and\nmarking the points of intersection with dogged exactness. When the\nfinal stake is driven he can no longer stand upright, and is fain\nto win back to the tunnel on hands and knees with groans and futile\ntooth-gnashings.\n\nBut the aftermath of the task still waits; shall wait until he has\nbarricaded the tunnel's mouth with an up-piling of timbers, fragments\nof rock, odds and ends movable, with a counterscarp of loose earth to\nmake it bullet-proof--the last scraped up with bleeding hands from the\nd\u00c3\u00a9bris at the head of the dump.\n\nThis done, he drags himself over the barricade, finds the saddle-bags\nagain, and strikes a light. The candle flame is but a yellow puncture\nin the thick gloom of the tunnel, but it serves his purpose, which is\nto scrawl a few words on a blank page of an engineer's note-book,--sole\nreminder of the thrifty forecast of saner days beyond the descent\ninto the nether depths. An imprecation bubbles up to punctuate the\nsignature; a pointless cursing, which is no more than a verbal mask for\na groan extorted by the agony of the effort to guide the pencil point.\nThe malison strings itself out into broken sentences of justification;\nmere ravings, as pointless as the curse. \"Finders are keepers,--that's\nthe law of the strong. 'He that hath clean hands shall be stronger\nand stronger.' I found it and gave it back, and he drowned it in a\nbottle.... Now it is mine; and to-morrow I'll be dead. But she'll know\nthat I haven't--that I haven't--quite--forgotten.\"\n\nTo pain-blurred eyes the candle flame has faded to a nebulous point in\nthe darkness, but still the light suffices. He has neither envelope\nnor sealing-wax, but he makes shift to seal the book with a wrapping\nof twine and a bit of pitch scraped from the nearest strut in the\ntimbering. After which he seeks and finds the crevice in which Garvin\nkept his explosives; and when the note-book is safely hidden, drops\nexhausted behind the breastwork, with the rifle at his shoulder,\nbeginning his vigil what time the first silvery flight of moon-arrows\nis pouring upon cliff-face and cabin opposite.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nIT is a fact no less deprecable than true that events in orderly\nsequence do not always lend themselves to the purposes of a chronicler\nwho would be glad to prick in his climaxes with a pen borrowed of\nthe dramatist. With some little labor, and the help of not a few\ncoincidences which may fairly be called fortuitous, the march of\nevents in the life of Henry Jeffard has led up to a point at which the\nfictional unities pause, confidently anticipative of a climax which\nshall re\u00c3\u00abcho the heroic struggle of the Spartan few at Thermopyl\u00c3\u00a6, or\nthe daring-do of the Pontine Horatius. But the facts are inexorable\nand altogether disappointing. With prologue and stage-setting for a\nSophoclean tragedy, the piece halts; hangs in the wind at the critical\nconjuncture like a misstaying ship; becomes, in point of fact, a mere\nmodern comedy-drama with a touch of travesty in it; and the unities,\nfictional and dramatic, shriek and expire.\n\nThis humiliating failure of the dramatic possibilities turns upon an\ninconsequent pivot-pin in the human mechanism, namely, the lack of\ncourage in the last resort in men of low degree. To kidnap a drunken\nman or to pistol an unarmed one is one thing; to force a sky-pitched\nGibraltar defended by a resolute fellow-being with a modern high-power\nrepeating rifle and an itching trigger-finger is quite another. This\nwas the conservative point of view of the aliased ones; and after the\nfinal futile attempt to gain the trail and the cover of the timber, the\ntwain held a council of war, vilified their luck, and sounded a retreat.\n\nThus it came about that Denby and his man, riding tantivy to the\nrescue, met the raiders two miles down the trail Aspenward; and\nhaving this eye-assurance that the foray had failed, the promoter was\nminded to go back to town to await Jeffard's return. But, having the\neye-assurance, he was not unwilling to add another. Bartrow's telegram\nhad named the figure of the assay; the incredible number of dollars and\ncents to the ton to be sweated out of the bonanza drift. Now assays\nare assays, but investment is shy of them, demanding mill-runs, and\nconservative estimates based on averages; and pondering these things\nthe rescuer reverted to his normal character of capitalist in ordinary\nto moneyless bonanzists, and determined to go on and see for himself.\nAccordingly, Jeffard's unexpected reinforcements pressed forward while\nthe enemy was in full tide of retreat; and a short half-hour later the\nsquadron of retrieval came near to paying the penalty of an unheralded\napproach, since it was upon the promoter and his henchman that Jeffard\npoured his final volley.\n\nSo much for the tragi-comedy of the sky-pitched Gibraltar, which made a\ntravesty of Jeffard's heart-breaking efforts to fortify himself in the\nold tunnel. And as for the apparent determination to die open-eyed and\nmilitant behind the barricade, the unromantic truth again steps in to\ngive the _coup de grace_ to the disappointed unities. There is a limit\nto human endurance, and the hardiest soldier may find it on a field\nas yet no more than half won. Fastings and fierce hurryings, wounds,\nphysical and spiritual, and ruthless determination may ride roughshod\nover Nature's turnpike; but Nature will demand her toll. For this cause\nJeffard saw no more than the first flight of moon-arrows glancing from\nthe face of the western cliff. Long before the Selenean archers were\nfairly warmed to their work he had fallen asleep, with his cheek on\nthe carved grip of the borrowed rifle; a lost man to all intents and\npurposes, if the fictional unities had not been put to flight by the\ncommonplace fact.\n\nBehold him, then, awakening what time the volleying sun has changed\nplaces with the moon-archers. The barricaded tunnel has a dim twilight\nof its own, but out and abroad the day is come, and the keen air is\ntinnient with the fine treble of the mountain morning. The slanting\nsun-fire spatters the gray cliff opposite, and a spiral of blue\nsmoke is curling peacefully above the chimney of the cabin. And in\nthe shallows of the stream a man, who is neither desperado black or\nred, is bathing the legs of a horse. Under such conditions one may\nimagine a recreant sentry rubbing his eyes to make sure, and presently\nclimbing the barricade to slide down the dump into parley range,\nquestion-charged.\n\nDenby unbent, smiling. \"Didn't I say that you were an inconsiderate\nmadman? You had to sleep or die.\"\n\n\"But when did you get here?\"\n\n\"About the time the proxies would have arrived, if you hadn't succeeded\nin discouraging them. It was late; much later than it would have been\nif you hadn't given us such an emphatic stand-off at the summit. Come\nacross and have some breakfast with us.\"\n\nJeffard found the foot-log and made shift to walk it.\n\n\"Did I fire at you? I thought it was another charge coming. They had\nbeen trying to rush me.\"\n\n\"So I inferred. We camped down out of range and gave you plenty of\ntime. You may be no marksman, but\"--He finished the sentence in dumb\nshow by taking off his hat and pointing to a bullet score in the crown\nof it. \"A few inches lower and you would have spoiled your first chance\nof capitalizing the Midas. How do you feel this morning?\"\n\n\"A bit unresponsive, but better than I have a right to expect. What\nbecame of the two raiders?\"\n\n\"We met them riding a steeplechase toward town. You discouraged them,\nas I said. From Donald's count of the bullet-splashes on that bald\nsummit you must have gotten in your work pretty lively.\"\n\nJeffard lowered the hammer of the rifle and emptied the magazine. \"It's\na good weapon,\" he said. \"I believe I could learn to shoot with it,\nafter a while. Will you sell it?\"\n\n\"Not to any one. But I'll make you a present of it. Let's go in and\nsee what Donald has found in his saddle-bags. It's a fine breakfast\nmorning.\"\n\nSo they went into the cabin and sat at meat on either side of a rough\ntable of Garvin's contriving, and were served by a solemn-faced Scot,\nwhose skill as a camp cook was commensurate with his ability to hold\nhis tongue. Notwithstanding the presumable urgencies the breakfast talk\nwas not of business. Jeffard would have had it so, but Denby forbade.\n\n\"Not yet,\" he objected. \"Not until you have caught up with yourself.\nAfter breakfast Donald will sling you a blanket hammock under the\ntrees, and you shall sleep the clock around. Then you'll feel fit, and\nwe can talk futures if you please.\"\n\nIf there were a prompting of suspicion in the glance with which Jeffard\nmet this proposal it remained in abeyance. With every embrasure gunned\nand manned the fortress of this life must always be pregnable on the\nhuman side; in the last resort one must trust something to the chance\nof loyalty in the garrison. Wherefore Jeffard accepted the promoter's\npipe and the blanket hammock, and fell asleep while Donald was pulling\ndown the barricade at the tunnel's mouth preparatory to liberating the\nneighing horse stabled in the heading.\n\nIt was evening, just such another as that one three months agone, in\nthe heart of which two men had sat at the cabin door looking a little\ninto each other's past, when Jeffard opened his eyes. The three\nhorses, saddled, but with loose cinches, were cropping the sun-cured\ngrass on the level which served as a dooryard for the cabin; and an\nappetizing smell of frying bacon was abroad in the air. Jeffard sat up\nyawning, and the promoter rose from the doorstep and rapped the ashes\nfrom his pipe.\n\n\"Feel better?\" he queried.\n\n\"I feel like a new man. I hadn't realized that I was so nearly spent.\"\n\n\"That is why I prescribed the blanket. Another day would have finished\nyou.\"\n\nJeffard slid out of the hammock and went to plunge his face and hands\nin the stream; after which they ate again as men who postpone the\nlesser to the greater; with Donald the taciturn serving them, and\nhunger waiving speech and ceremony.\n\nIt was yet no more than twilight when the meal was finished; and Denby\nfound a candle and matches in the henchman's saddlebags.\n\n\"If you are ready, we'll go up to the tunnel and have another look at\nthe lead before we go,\" he said. \"I have been examining it to-day, and\nI'll make you a proposition on the ground, if you like.\"\n\nJeffard pieced out the inference with the recollection of the saddled\nhorses.\n\n\"Do we go back to-night?\"\n\n\"Yes; if you are good for it. It has been a pretty warm day for the\nseason, and we are like to have more of them. There is a good bit of\nsnow on the trail, and if it softens we shall be shut in. That's one\nreason, and another is this: if we make a deal and mean to get any\nmachinery in here before snow flies and the range is blocked, we've got\nto be about it.\"\n\nJeffard nodded acquiescence, and they fared forth to cross the foot-log\nand toil up the shelving slope of the gray dump. It was a stiff climb\nfor a whole man, and at the summit Jeffard sat down with his hands to\nhis head and his teeth agrind.\n\n\"By Jove! but that sets it in motion again in good shape!\" he groaned.\n\"Sit down here and let's talk it out in the open. I don't care to\nburrow.\"\n\nDenby pocketed his candle, and they sat together on the brink of\nthe dump, with their backs to the opening; and thus it chanced that\nneither of them saw a shadowy figure skulking among the firs beside\nthe tunnel's mouth. When they began to talk the figure edged nearer,\nflitting ghostlike from tree to tree, and finally crouching under the\npenthouse of the tunnel timbering.\n\nThe crimson and mauve had faded out of the western sky when the two at\nthe dump-head rose, and Jeffard said: \"Your alternative is fair enough.\nIt's accepted, without conditions other than this--that you will\nadvance me a few hundred dollars for my own purposes some time within\nthirty days.\"\n\n\"You needn't make that a condition; I should be glad to tide you over\nin any event. But I am sorry you won't let me buy in. As I have said,\nthere is enough here for both of us.\"\n\nThe aftermath of the getting up was a sharp agony, and Jeffard had his\nhands to his head again. When he answered it was to say:--\n\n\"I sha'n't sell. There are reasons, and you may take this for the lack\nof a better. A while back, when a single meal in the day was sometimes\nbeyond me, I used to say that if the tide should ever turn I'd let the\nmoney go on piling up and up until there was no possibility of hunger\nin an eternity of futures. You say the tide has turned.\"\n\n\"It has, for a fact; and I don't know that I blame you. If it were mine\nI should probably try to keep it whole.\"\n\nJeffard went on as one who follows out his own train of thought\nregardless of answers relevant or impertinent. \"I said that, and I\ndon't know that I have changed my mind. But before we strike hands on\nthe bargain it may be as well to go back to the question which you were\ngood enough to leave in abeyance yesterday.\"\n\n\"The question of ethics?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I am going to take something for granted, if you don't choose to be\nfrank with me.\"\n\n\"It will be safer to take nothing for granted.\"\n\n\"But the claim is yours?\"\n\n\"Legally, yes; there will be no litigation.\"\n\n\"But honestly, as man to man.\" Denby put his hands on the wounded man's\nshoulders, and turned him about so that the fading light in the west\nfell upon his face. \"My dear fellow, I've known you but a day, but\nyour face isn't the face of a scoundrel. I can't believe that the man\nwho made the magnificent fight that you did would make it to overreach\nhis partner.\"\n\nJeffard turned aside, with a backward step that freed him from the\nfriendly hands. Twice he tried to speak, and at the third attempt the\nwords came but haltingly.\n\n\"It will be better in the end--better for all concerned--if you--if you\ndo believe it. Believe it, and cause it to be believed, if you choose.\nI have counted the cost, and am ready to take the consequences.\"\n\nDenby thrust his hands into his pockets and began to tramp, three paces\nand a turn, across and across the narrow embankment. A little light was\nbeginning to sift in between the man and his mystery, but it was not of\nthe sun.\n\n\"Mr. Jeffard, I'd like to ask a question. You needn't answer it if you\ndon't want to. Do you know who drove this tunnel?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Was it the man who raced you from Leadville to Aspen, and who shot you\nwhen you tried to bluff him by making him believe that you had already\nlocated the claim in your own name?\"\n\n\"It was.\"\n\n\"Then, to put it plainly, you are the aggressor, after all. You have\nreally jumped your partner's claim.\"\n\nThe promoter stopped and faced his man, and the skulker at the\ntunnel's mouth crept nearer, as a listener who may not miss a word.\n\n\"That is what men will say, I suppose; and I shall not contradict them.\nHe has forfeited his right.\" Jeffard said it with eyes downcast, but\nthere was no incertitude in the words.\n\n\"Forfeited his right? How? By shooting at you in a very natural fit of\nfrenzied rage? I can't believe that you realize the enormity of this\nthing, Mr. Jeffard. You are new to the West. It is true that the law\ncan't touch you, but public opinion, the sentiment of a mining region,\nwill brand you as the basest of thieves.\"\n\n\"That is the public's privilege. I shall not attempt to defend\nmyself--to you, or to any one. The consequences are mine to suffer or\nto ignore.\"\n\n\"You can't ignore them. Your best friends will turn upon you, and\nmining-camp justice will not only acquit the man who tried to kill\nyou--it will fight for him and condemn you.\"\n\n\"But yesterday you said it would have given me the benefit of the doubt\nand lynched him. I can fight my own battle.\"\n\n\"Yes, I did say so; and, lacking your own evidence against yourself, it\nwill condemn him yet. Had you thought of that?\"\n\n\"Mr. Denby, I have answered your questions because you had a right to\nask them. To the public I shall neither deny nor affirm.\"\n\n\"Then you'll have the choice of posing as a scoundrel on the one hand,\nor of consenting to the death or imprisonment of a measurably innocent\nman on the other. I don't envy you.\"\n\n\"It is my own affair, as you were good enough to say yesterday. Do you\nwish to withdraw your proposal?\"\n\nDenby took time to think about it, pacing out his decision what time\nthe moon was beginning to silver the western snow-caps.\n\n\"No; as I have made it and you have accepted it, the proposal is merely\na matter of service to be rendered and paid for; I furnish the capital\nto work the mine for a year for a certain portion of the output. But\nif you had taken me up on the original proposition, I should beg to be\nexcused. Under the circumstances, I shouldn't care to be a joint owner\nwith you.\"\n\n\"You couldn't be,\" said Jeffard briefly; \"you, nor any one else.\"\n\n\"Well, we are agreed as to that. Shall we go now? Donald is waiting,\nand the moon will be up by the time we strike the trail.\"\n\n\"One moment; I have left something in the tunnel.\"\n\nJeffard turned back toward the timbered archway, and the promoter went\nwith him. In the act a shadowy figure darted into the mouth of gloom\nand was seen by Denby.\n\n\"What was that?\"\n\n\"I didn't see anything.\"\n\nDenby stumbled over the remains of the barricade. \"That must have been\nwhat I saw,\" he said. \"But at the moment I could have sworn it was a\nman dodging into the tunnel.\"\n\nA few feet from the entrance Jeffard felt along the wall for the\ncrevice, found it, and presently thrust the note-book into Denby's\nhands.\n\n\"You may remember that I told you I should leave my will here against\na contingency which seemed altogether probable. In view of what has\nsince passed between us, I sha'n't hold you to your promise to act as\nmy executor; but if anything happens to me I shall be glad if you will\nsend that book under seal to Dick Bartrow. You will do that much for\nme, won't you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That is all; now I am at your service.\"\n\nA few minutes later the cabin and the bit of dry sward in front of it\nwere deserted, and the whispering firs had swallowed up the last faint\nechoes of minishing hoof-beats. Not until the silence was unbroken did\nthe shadowy figure venture out of its hiding in the tunnel to stumble\nblindly down the dump, across the foot-log, and so to the cabin door.\nHere it went down on hands and knees to quarter the ground like a\nhungry animal in search of food. Unhappily, the simile is no simile. It\nwas James Garvin, who, for the better part of two days, had not tasted\nfood. And when finally the patient search was rewarded by the retrieval\nof a few scraps of bacon and pan-bread, the broken meats of Donald's\nsupper-table, the starving fugitive fell upon them with a beastlike\ngrowl of triumph. But in the midst of the scanty feast he dropped the\nbread and meat to cover his face with his hands, rocking back and forth\nin his misery and sobbing like a child.\n\n\"Oh, my Gawd!--ef I hadn't hearn it out'n his own mouth ... and me\na-lovin' him thess like he'd been blood-kin to me! Oh, my Gawd!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nIT was rather late in the autumn, too late to admit of a rush\nof prospectors to the shut-in valley, when the fame of the new\ngold-bearing district in the Elk Mountains began to be noised about.\nAs bonanza fame is like to be, the earlier bruitings of it were as\nnebulous as the later and more detailed accounts were fabulous. Some\ngarbled story of the fight for possession found its way into the\nnewspapers; and since this had its starting-point in the resentment of\nthe Aspen newsgatherer who had been so curtly sent to the right-about\nby Jeffard, it became the basis of an accusation, which was scathing\nand fearless, or covert and retractable, in just proportion to the\nobsequiousness of the journalistic accusers.\n\nIn its most favorable rendering this story was an ugly one; but here\nagain chance, in the form of reportorial inaccuracy, was kind to\nJeffard. From his boyhood people had been stumbling over his name; and\nwith ample facilities for verifying the spelling of it the reporters\nbegan, continued, and ended by making it \"Jeffers,\" \"Jeffreys,\" and\nin one instance even \"Jefferson.\" Hence, with Bartrow as the single\nexception, no one who knew Jeffard identified him with the man who had\nfigured as the putative villain-hero in the fight for possession.\n\nBartrow read the account of the race, the shooting affray, and the\nsubsequent details of the capitalizing of the Midas, with Denby as its\npromoter and Jeffard as sole owner, with judgment suspended. It was not\nin him to condemn any man unheard; and Jeffard had put himself safely\nout of reach of queryings, friendly or otherwise, by burying himself\nfor the winter with the development force which the promoter had\nhurried across the range before the snows isolated the shut-in valley.\nLater, when he had to pay the note in the Leadville bank, Bartrow had a\ntwinge of dismay; but again invincible fairness came to the rescue, and\nhe lifted the dishonored paper at a time when he could ill afford to,\npromising himself that this, too, should be held in solution; should\nnot even be precipitated in confidence with any one.\n\nThis promise he kept until Constance Elliott plumbed the depths of\nhim, as she was prone to do when he gave evidence of having anything\nto conceal. The occasion was the midwinter ball of the First Families\nof Colorado; and having more than one score to settle with the young\nminer, who had lately been conspicuous only by his absence, Connie had\narbitrarily revised Bartrow's programme,--which contemplated a monopoly\nof all the dances Miss Van Vetter would give him.\n\n\"Well, catalogue 'em--what have I done?\" demanded the unabashed one,\nwhen she had marched him into that particular alcove of the great hotel\ndining-room which did temporary duty as a conservatory.\n\n\"Several things.\" Stephen Elliott's daughter was in the mood called\npertness in disagreeable young women. \"Have you quite forgotten that I\nstand _in loco parentis_ to the giddy and irresponsible young person\nwhose card you have covered with your scrawly autographs?\"\n\nThe idea was immensely entertaining to the young miner, who laughed\nso heartily that a sentimental couple billing and cooing behind the\nfan-palms took wing immediately. \"You? you chaperoning Myr--Miss Van\nVetter? That's a good one!\"\n\n\"It's a bad one, where you are concerned. What do you mean by such an\ninconsistent breach of the proprieties?\"\n\n\"Inconsistent? I'm afraid I don't quite catch on.\"\n\n\"Yes, inconsistent. You bury yourself for months on end in that\npowder-smelly old tunnel of yours, and about the time we've comfortably\nforgotten you, you straggle in with a dress-coat on your arm and\nproceed to monopolize one of us. What do you take us for?\"\n\nIt was on the tip of Bartrow's tongue to retort that he would very much\nlike to take Miss Van Vetter for better or worse, but he had not the\ncourage of his convictions. So he kept well in the middle of the road,\nand made the smoke-blackened tunnel his excuse for the inconsistency.\n\n\"It isn't 'months,' Connie; or at least it's only two of them. You\nknow I'd be glad enough to chase myself into Denver every other day if\nI could. But it is coming down to brass tacks with us in the Little\nMyriad, and I've just got to keep my eye on the gun.\"\n\nWhereupon pertness, or the Constance Elliott transmutation of it,\nvanished, and she made him sit down.\n\n\"Tell me all about the Little Myriad, Dick. Is it going to keep its\npromise?\"\n\nThe Little Myriad's owner sought and found a handkerchief, using it\nmopwise. Curious questions touching the prospects of his venture on\nTopeka Mountain were beginning to have a perspiratory effect upon him.\n\n\"I wish I could know for sure, Connie. Sometimes I think it will; and\nsome other times I should think it means to go back on me,--if I dared\nto.\"\n\n\"Isn't the lead still well-defined?\" Constance dropped into the\nmining technicalities with the easy familiarity of one born in the\nmetalliferous West.\n\n\"It is now; but two months ago, or thereabouts, it pinched out\nentirely. That is why I hibernated.\"\n\n\"Was the last mill-run encouraging?\"\n\n\"N-no, I can't say that it was. The ore--what little there is of\nit--seems to grade rather lower as we go in. But it's a true fissure,\nand it must begin to go the other way when we get deep enough.\"\n\nFor a half-score of fan-sweeps Connie was silent. Then: \"Is the purse\ngrowing light, Dickie? Because if it is, poppa's is still comfortably\nfat.\"\n\nBartrow laughed in a way to indicate that the strain was lessened for\nthe moment. \"I believe you and your father would give away the last\ndollar you have in the world. But it hasn't come to a fresh loan with\nme yet.\"\n\n\"When it does, you know where to float it.\"\n\n\"When it does, I sha'n't rob my best friends. If I have to borrow more\nmoney for development, I'm afraid the loan will be classed as 'extra\nhazardous.' But you said there were several things. What else have I\ndone?\"\n\n\"The next is something you haven't done. You haven't written a line to\nMr. Lansdale in all these weeks,--not even to thank him for taking your\nfoolish telegram about the Margaret Gannon crisis seriously. And he\ntells me he has written you twice.\"\n\n\"I'm a miserable sinner, and letter writing isn't in me. Is Lansdale\nhere? I'll go and square myself in the most abject formula you can\nsuggest.\"\n\n\"He isn't here. He is out at Bennett on a ranch.\"\n\n\"On a ranch in midwinter? Who on top of earth told him to do that?\"\n\n\"One of the doctors. I wanted to dissuade him, but I hadn't the heart\nto try. He is so anxious to live.\"\n\n\"Naturally.\" Bartrow eyed his companion in a way which was meant to\nbe a measure of the things he knew and would by no means tell, but\nConstance was opening and shutting her fan with inthought paramount,\nand saw it not. Whereat Bartrow was brutal enough to say: \"Is he going\nto make a go of it?\"\n\n\"Oh, I hope so, Dick! It is such a pathetic struggle. And he is like\nall the others who are best worth keeping alive: he won't let any one\nhelp him. Just fancy him working for his board on a dreary prairie\nranch! The monotony of it is enough to kill him.\"\n\n\"I should say so. Lamb ranch, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then I can imagine the hilarity of it. Up at all sorts of hours and in\nall weathers feeding and watering. That isn't what he needs. A wagon\ntrip in summer, with good company, lots of outdoors, and nothing to\ndo but eat and sleep, would be more like it. If he pulls through to\nspring, and the Myriad will let up on me for a month or two, I don't\nknow but I shall be tempted to make him try it.\"\n\n\"Oh, Dick! would you?\" There was a quick upflash of wistful emotion\nin the calm gray eyes. Bartrow set it down to a fresh growth in\nperspicacity on his own part that he was able to interpret it--or\nthought he was. But the little upflash went out like a taper in the\ndark with the added afterthought. \"It's no use, Dick. The Myriad won't\nlet you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it will; though I'm bound to admit that it doesn't look that\nway at present. Now, if Jef--\"\n\nFrom what has gone before it will be understood that any mention of\nJeffard for good or ill was the one thing which Bartrow had promised\nhimself to avoid at all hazards; wherefore he broke the name in the\nmidst, coughed, dragged out his watch,--in short, did what manlike\nuntactfulness may do to create a diversion, and at the end of it found\nthe unafraid eyes fixed upon him with mandatory orders in them.\n\n\"Go on,\" she said calmly. \"If Mr. Jeffard\"--\n\n\"Really, Connie, I must break it off short; my time's up. Don't you\nhear the orchestra? Miss Van Vetter will\"--\n\nBut Connie was not to be turned aside by any consideration for\nBartrow's engagements or her own; nor yet by the inflow into the\nalcove-conservatory of sundry other fanning couples lately freed from\nthe hop-and-slide of the two-step. Nor yet again by the appearance\nof young Mr. Theodore Calmaine, who came up behind Bartrow and was\nstraightway transfixed and driven forth with pantomimic cut and thrust.\n\n\"Myra will have no difficulty in finding a partner. Don't be foolish,\nDick. I have known all along that you have learned something about Mr.\nJeffard which you wouldn't tell me. You may remember that you have\npersistently ignored my questions in your answers to my letters,--and\nI paid you back by telling you little or nothing about Myra. Now what\nwere you going to say?\"\n\n\"I was going to say that if Jeffard were like what he used to be, he\nwould do for Lansdale what I shall probably not be able to do.\"\n\n\"What do you know about Mr. Jeffard?\"\n\n\"What all the world knows--and a little more. Of course you have read\nwhat the newspapers had to say?\"\n\n\"I have never seen a mention of his name.\"\n\n\"Why, you must have; they were full of it a month or two ago, and\nwill be again as soon as the range opens and we find out what the big\nbonanza has been doing through the winter. You don't mean to say that\nyou didn't read about the free-gold strike in the Elk Mountains, and\nthe locomotive race, and the shooting scrape in the hotel at Aspen, and\nall that?\"\n\nThe steady eyes were veiled and Connie's breath came in nervous little\ngasps. Any man save downright Richard Bartrow would have made a swift\ndiversion, were it only to an open window or back to the ballroom. But\nhe sat stocklike and silent, letting her win through the speechlessness\nof it to the faltered reply.\n\n\"I--I saw it; yes. But the name of that man was--was not Jeffard.\"\n\n\"No, it was Jeffers, or anything that came handy in the newspaper\naccounts. But that was a reporter's mistake.\"\n\n\"Dick,\"--the steadfast eyes were transfixing him again,--\"are you quite\nsure of that?\"\n\n\"I ought to be. I was the man who helped him out at the pinch and got\nhim started on the locomotive chase.\"\n\n\"You helped him?--then all those things they said about him were true?\"\n\nIt was Bartrow's turn to hesitate. \"I--I'm trying not to believe that,\nConnie.\"\n\n\"But you know the facts; or at least, more of them than the newspapers\ntold. Did the claim really belong to him, or to James Garvin?\"\n\nBartrow crossed his legs, uncrossed them, and again had recourse to his\nwatch.\n\n\"I wish you'd leave the whole business up in the air, Connie, the way\nI'm trying to. It doesn't seem quite fair, somehow, to condemn him\nbehind his back.\"\n\n\"But the facts,\" she insisted. \"You know them, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes; and they're against him.\" Bartrow confessed it in sheer\ndesperation. \"The claim was Garvin's; Jeffard not only admitted it, but\nhe started out on the chase with the declared determination of standing\nbetween Garvin and those two blacklegs who were trying to plunder him.\nThat's all; that's as far as my facts go. Beyond that you--and the\nnewspapers--know as much as I do.\"\n\n\"Not quite all, Dick. You say you helped him; that means that you lent\nhim money, or borrowed it for him. Did he ever pay it back?\"\n\nBartrow got upon his feet at that and glowered down upon her with\nmingled chagrin and awe in gaze and answer.\n\n\"Say, Connie, you come precious near to being uncanny at times, don't\nyou know it? That was the one thing I didn't mean to tell any one. Yes,\nI borrowed for him; and no, he didn't pay it back. That's all--all of\nthe all. If you put me in a stamp-mill you couldn't pound out anything\nelse. Now, for pity's sake, let me get back to Miss Van Vetter before I\nfall in with the notion that I'm too transparent to be visible to the\nnaked eye.\"\n\nShe rose and took his arm.\n\n\"You're good, Dickie,\" she said softly; \"much too good for this world.\nI'm sorry for you, because it earns you so many buffetings.\"\n\n\"And you think I'm in for another on Jeffard's account.\"\n\n\"I am sure you are--now. The last time I saw him he wore a mask; a\nhorrible mask of willful degradation and cynicism and self-loathing;\nbut I saw behind it.\"\n\nThey were making a slow circuit of the ballroom in search of Connie's\ncousin, and the throng and the music isolated them.\n\n\"What did you see?\"\n\n\"I saw the making of a strong man; strong for good or for evil; a man\nwho could compel the world-attitudes that most of us have to sue for,\nor who would be strong enough on the evil side to flout and ignore\nthem. I thought then that he was at the parting of the ways, but it\nseems I was mistaken,--that the real balancing moment came with what\npoppa calls the 'high-mountain bribe,'--Satan's offer of the kingdoms\nof this world and the glory of them.\"\n\nNow, a thronged ballroom is scarcely a fit place for heart-to-heart\noutreachings; but there be loyal hearts who are not constrained by\ntheir encompassments, and Bartrow was of that brotherhood. They had\nattained a corner where one might swing a short-sword without fear of\nbeheading the nearest of the dancers or out-sitters, and he faced about\nand took both of Connie's hands in his.\n\n\"Do you know, little sister, I'm awfully glad you're able to talk that\nway about him. There was a time when I began to be afraid--for your\nsake first, and afterward for\"--\n\nIt is conceivable that the frankest of young women may have some\nreserves of time and place, if not of subjects, and before honest Dick\ncould finish, Constance had freed herself and was reproaching young\nCalmaine for not seeking her out for the dance in process,--which was\nhis.\n\nTeddy's apology had in it the flavor of long acquaintance and the\ninsolence thereof. \"You're a cool one,\" he said, when they had left\nBartrow behind. \"As if I didn't stand for five good minutes at the door\nof that conservatory place, with you eye-pistoling and daggering me to\nmake me go away!\"\n\nThinking about it afterward, Bartrow wondered a little that Connie\nseemed bent on ignoring him through the remainder of the functional\nhours, large and small, but so it was. And when finally he was\nconstrained to put Miss Van Vetter in the carriage, Connie's good-night\nand good-by were of the briefest. Miss Van Vetter, too, was silent\non the homeward drive, and this Connie remarked, charging it openly\nto Dick's account when they were before the fire in Myra's room\ncontemplating the necessity of going to bed.\n\n\"No, Mr. Bartrow was all that the most exacting person could\ndemand,--and more,\" said Miss Van Vetter, going to the mirror to begin\nthe relaxing process. \"It was something he told me.\"\n\n\"About Mr. Jeffard?\"\n\n\"Yes; how did you know?\"\n\n\"I didn't know--I guessed.\"\n\n\"Isn't it dreadful!\"\n\n\"No. Some of the other things he did might have been that; but this is\nunspeakable.\"\n\nMyra turned her back upon the mirror and came to stand behind Connie's\nchair with her arms about her cousin's neck.\n\n\"Connie, dear, do you know that one time I was almost afraid that\nyou,--but now I am glad,--glad that your point of view is--is quite\nextrinsic, you know.\"\n\nConnie's gaze was upon the fire in the grate, fresh-stirred and\nglowing, a circumstance which may have accounted for the sudden\ntrembling of the eyelids and the upwelling of tears in the steadfast\neyes. And as for the nervous little quaver in her voice, there was\nfatigue to answer for that.\n\n\"I--I'm so glad you all take that for granted,\" she said. \"I don't know\nwhat I should do if you didn't.\"\n\nAnd a little later Myra went to bed and to sleep, wondering if, after\nall, there were not secret places in the heart of her transparent\nkinswoman which evaded the search-warrant of cousinly disinterest.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nTHE obsequious waiter had cleared the table and brought in the dessert,\nand was hovering in the middle distance with two cigars in a whiskey\nglass. The persiflant young people at the other end of the table rose\nand went away, leaving a grateful silence behind them; and the clerical\ngentleman at Lansdale's right folded his napkin in absent-minded\ndeference to home habit, and slipped sidewise out of his chair as if\nreluctant to mar the new-born hush.\n\nBartrow was down from the mine on the ostensible business of restocking\nthe commissariat department of the Little Myriad,--a business which,\nprior to Miss Van Vetter's Denver year, had transacted itself\nindifferently well by letter,--and Lansdale was dining with him at\nthe hotel by hospitable appointment. There were months between this\nand their last meeting, an entire winter, in point of fact; but it is\none of the compensations of man-to-man friendships that they ignore\nabsences and bridge intervals smoothly, uncoupling and upcoupling again\nwith small jar of accountings for the incidents of the lacuna.\n\nBecause of the persiflant young people, the fire of query and rejoinder\nhad been the merest shelling of the woods on either side; but with the\nadvent of quiet Bartrow said: \"Your winter on the lamb-ranch didn't do\nyou much good, did it?\"\n\n\"Think not?\" Lansdale looked up quickly, with a pathetic plea for\nheartening in the deep-set eyes of him. \"I was hoping you'd say it had.\nI feel stronger--at times.\"\n\nBartrow saw the plea and the pathos of it, and added one more to the\ninnumerable contemnings of his own maladroitness. He was quite sure of\nhis postulate, however,--as sure as he was of the unnecessary cruelty\nof setting it in words. Lansdale was visibly failing. The clean-shaven\nface was thin to gauntness, and the dark eyes were unnaturally bright\nand wistful. Bartrow bribed the ubiquitous waiter to remove himself,\nmaking the incident an excuse for changing the subject.\n\n\"Never saw or heard anything more of Jeffard, did you?\" he said,\npitching the conversational quoit toward a known peg of common\ninterest, and taking it for granted that Lansdale, like Connie, had not\nread the proletary's name into the newspaper misspellings.\n\n\"Not a thing. And I have often wondered what happened.\"\n\n\"Then Connie hasn't told you?\"\n\n\"Miss Elliott? No; I didn't know she knew him.\"\n\n\"She met him a time or two; which is another way of saying that she\nknows him better than we do. She's a whole assay outfit when it comes\nto sizing people up.\"\n\n\"What was her opinion of Jeffard?\" Lansdale was curious to know if it\nconfirmed his own.\n\n\"Oh, she thinks he is a grand rascal, of course,--as everybody does.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Lansdale, having in mind the proletary's later\nreincarnations as vagrant and starveling. \"You didn't see much of him\nafter he got fairly into the toboggan and on the steeper grades, did\nyou?\"\n\n\"Here in Denver?--no. But what I did see was enough to show that he\nwas pretty badly tiger-bitten. You told me afterward that he took the\npost-graduate course in his particular specialty.\"\n\n\"He did; sunk his shaft, as you mining folk would say, straight on down\nto the chaotic substrata; pawned himself piecemeal to feed the animals,\nand went hungry between times by way of contrast.\"\n\n\"Poor devil!\" said Bartrow, speaking in the past tense.\n\n\"Yes, in all conscience; but not so much for what he suffered as for\nwhat he was.\"\n\nThe distinction was a little abstruse for a man whose nayword was\nobviousness, but for the better part of a year Bartrow had been\nborrowing of Miss Van Vetter; among other things some transplantings of\nsubtlety.\n\n\"That's where we come apart,\" he objected, with amiable obstinacy. \"You\nthink the root of the thing is in the man,--has been in him all along,\nand only waiting for a chance to sprout. Now I don't. I think it's in\nthe atmosphere; in the--the\"--\n\n\"Environment?\" suggested Lansdale.\n\n\"Yes, I guess that's the word; something outside of the man; something\nthat he didn't make, and isn't altogether to blame for, and can't\nalways control.\"\n\nThe man with a moiety of the seer's gift suffered his eyebrows to arch\nquery-wise. \"Doesn't that ask for a remodeling of the accepted theory\nof good and evil?\"\n\n\"No, you don't!\" laughed Bartrow. \"You are not going to pull me in over\nmy head, if I know it. But I'll wrestle with you from now till midnight\non my own ground. You take the best fellow in the world, brought up on\ngood wholesome bread and meat and the like, and stop his rations for\nawhile. Then, when he is hungry enough, you give him a rag to chew, and\nhe'll proceed to chew it,--not necessarily because he likes the taste\nof the rag, or because he was born with the rag-chewing appetite, but\nsimply for the reason that you have put it in his mouth, and, being\nhungry, he's got to chew something. Jeffard is a case in point.\"\n\n\"Let us leave Jeffard and the personal point of view out of the\nquestion and stand it upon its own feet,\" rejoined Lansdale, warming to\nthe fray. \"Doubtless Jeffard's problem is divisible by the common human\nfactor, whatever that may be, but your theory makes it too easy for the\nevil-doer. Consequently I can't admit it,--not even in Jeffard's case.\"\n\n\"I could make you admit it,\" retorted Bartrow, with generous warmth,\nforgetting the dishonored note in the Leadville bank, and remembering\nonly the year agone partnership in brother-keeping. \"You can size\npeople up ten times to my once,--you ought to; it's right in your\nline,--but I know Jeffard worlds better than you do, and I could tell\nyou things about him that would make you weep. Since he did those\nthings I've had a rattling good chance to change my mind about him, but\nI'm not going to do it till I have to. I'm going to keep on believing\nthat away down deep under this devil's-drift of--what was it you called\nit?--environment, there's a streak of good clean ore. It may take the\nstamp-mill or the smelter to get it out, but it's there all the same.\nHe may fall down on you and me and all of his friends at any one of a\ndozen pinches,--he has fallen down on me, and pretty middling hard,\ntoo,--but there will come a pinch sometime that will pull him up short,\nand then you'll see what is in the lower levels of him,--what was there\nall the time, waiting for somebody to sink a shaft deep enough to tap\nit.\"\n\nLansdale took the cigar Bartrow was proffering and clipped the end of\nit, reflectively deliberate. He was silent so long that Bartrow said:\n\"Well? you don't believe it, eh?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't say that,\" Lansdale rejoined abstractedly; \"anyway, not of\nJeffard. Perhaps you are right. He has given me the same impression\nat times, but he was always saying or doing something immediately\nafterward to obliterate it. But I was wondering why you prophesy so\nconfidently about a man who, for aught we know, took himself out of the\nworld the better part of a year ago.\"\n\n\"Suicided?--not much! He's alive all right; very much alive and very\nmuch on top, as far as money is concerned. You don't read the papers, I\ntake it?\"\n\nLansdale's smile was of weariness. \"Being at present a reporter on one\nof them I read them as little as may be. What should I have read that I\ndidn't?\"\n\n\"To begin back a piece, you should have read last fall about the big\nfree-gold strike in the Elk Mountains, and an exciting little scrap\nbetween two men to get the first location on it.\"\n\n\"I remember that.\"\n\n\"Well, one of the men--the successful one--was Jeffard; our Jeffard.\nYour newspaper accomplices didn't spell his name right,--won't spell it\nright yet,--but it's Henry Jeffard, and yesterday's 'Coloradoan' says\nhe's on his way to Denver to play leading man in the bonanza show.\"\n\nLansdale went silent what time it took to splice out the past with\nthe present. After which he said: \"I understand now why Miss Elliott\ncondemns him, but not quite clearly why you defend him. As I remember\nit, the man who got possession of the Midas posed as a highwayman of\nthe sort that the law can't punish. What has he to say for himself?\"\n\nBartrow shook his head. \"I don't know. I haven't seen him since one\nday last fall; the day of the locomotive chase.\"\n\n\"Did you know then that he was going to steal his partner's mine?\"\n\n\"No. I thought then that he was going to do the other thing. And I'll\nnot believe yet that he hasn't done the other thing. It's the finish\nI'm betting on. He may have flown the track at all the turns,--at\nthis last turn as well as the others,--but when it comes to the home\nstretch, you watch him put his shoulder into the collar and remember\nwhat I said. I hope we'll both be there to see.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" Lansdale acquiesced. \"It isn't in me to smash any man's\nideal. And if anything could make me have faith in my kind, I think\nyour belief in the inherent virtue of the race would work the miracle.\"\n\nBartrow laughed again, and pushed back his chair.\n\n\"It does you a whole lot of good to play at being a cold-blooded\nman-hater, doesn't it? But it's no go. Your practice doesn't gee with\nyour preaching. Let's go out on the porch and smoke, if it won't be too\ncool for you.\"\n\nThey left the dining-room together and strolled out through the crowded\nlobby, lighting their cigars at the news-stand in passing. There was a\nconvention of some sort in progress, and a sprinkling of the delegates,\nwith red silk badges displayed, was scattered among the chairs on the\nveranda. Bartrow found two chairs a little apart from the decorated\nones, faced them, and tilted his own against the railing. When his\ncigar was well alight he bethought him of a neglected duty.\n\n\"By the way, old man, I've never had the grace to say 'much obliged'\nfor your neatness and dispatch in carrying out my wire order. I suppose\nyou've forgotten it months ago, but I haven't. It was good of you.\nConnie wrote me about it at the time, and she said a whole lot of\npretty things about the way you climbed into the breach.\"\n\n\"Did she?\" Lansdale's habitual reserve fell away from him like a cast\ngarment, and if Bartrow had been less oblivious to face readings he\nmight have seen that which would have made his heart ache. But he saw\nnothing and went on, following his own lead.\n\n\"Yes; she said you took hold like a good fellow, and hung on like a dog\nto a root,--that is, she didn't say that, of course, but that was the\nsense of it. I'm obliged, a whole lot.\"\n\n\"You needn't be. The obligation is on my side. It was a pleasure to\ntry to help Miss Elliott, even if I wasn't able to accomplish anything\nworth mentioning.\"\n\n\"Yes. She's good people; there's no discount on that. But say, you\ndidn't size up Pete Grim any better than you had to. A good stiff bluff\nis about the only thing he can appreciate.\"\n\n\"If you had heard me talk to him you would have admitted that I was\ntrying to bluff him the best I knew how,\" said Lansdale.\n\nBartrow laughed unfeelingly. \"Tried to scare him with a lawsuit, didn't\nyou? What do you suppose a man like Grim cares for the law? Why, bless\nyour innocent soul, he can buy all the law he needs six days in the\nweek and get it gratis on the seventh. But you might have fetched him\ndown with a gun.\"\n\nLansdale tried to imagine himself attempting such a thing and failed.\n\"I'm afraid I couldn't have done that--successfully. It asks for a\nlittle practice, doesn't it? and from what I have learned of Mr. Peter\nGrim in my small dealings with him, I fancy he wouldn't make a very\ntractable lay-figure for a beginner to experiment on. But we worried\nthe thing through after a fashion, and recovered the young woman's\nsewing-machine finally.\"\n\n\"Bought Grim off, didn't you?\"\n\n\"That was what it amounted to. Miss Elliott's father came to the\nrescue.\"\n\n\"There's a man for you!\" declared Bartrow. \"Built from the ground up,\nand white all the way through. And Connie's just like him. She's first\ncousin to the angels when she isn't making game of you. But I suppose\nyou don't need to have anybody sing her praises to you at this late\nday.\"\n\n\"No; that is why I say the obligation is on my side. I am indebted to\nyour 'wire order' for more things than I could well catalogue.\"\n\nBartrow rocked gently on the hinder legs of his chair, assuring himself\nthat one of the things needed not to be listed. After which he became\ndiplomatically abstruse on his own account. Two of the decorated ones\ncame by, promenading arm in arm, and he waited until they were out of\nhearing.\n\n\"Found them good people to know, didn't you? _Bueno!_ You used to\nhibernate a heap too much.\" Then, with labored indifference: \"What do\nyou think of Miss Van Vetter?\"\n\nLansdale laughed.\n\n\"Whatever you would like to have me think, my dear boy. Shall I say\nthat she is the quintessence of all the virtuous graces and the\ngraceful virtues?--a paragon of para--\"\n\n\"Oh, come off!\" growled the abstruse one. \"You've been taking lessons\nof Connie. You know what I mean. Do I--that is--er--do you think I\nstand a ghost of a show there? Honest, now.\"\n\n\"My dear Richard, if I could look into the heart of a young woman and\nread what is therein written, I could pass poverty in the street with a\nnod contemptuous. I'd be a made man.\"\n\n\"Oh, you be hanged, will you? You're a wild ass of the lamb-ranches,\nand wisdom has shook you,\" Bartrow rejoined, relapsing into\nvituperation. \"Why can't you quit braying for a minute or so and be\nserious? It's a serious world, for the bigger part.\"\n\n\"Do you find it so? with a Miss Van Vetter for an eye-piece to your\ntelescope? I am astonished.\"\n\nBartrow pulled his hat over his eyes and enveloped himself in a\ncloud of smoke. \"When you're ready to fold up your ears and be human\npeople again, just let me know, will you?\" This from the midst of the\nsmoke-cloud.\n\n\"Don't sulk, my Achilles; you shall have your Briseis,--if you can get\nher,\" laughed Lansdale. \"Miss Van Vetter hasn't made a confidant of me,\nbut I'll tell you a lot of encouraging little fibs, if that will help\nyou.\"\n\nBartrow fanned an opening in the tobacco-nimbus. \"What do you think\nabout it?\"\n\n\"I think I should find out for myself, if I were you,\" said Lansdale,\nwith becoming gravity.\n\n\"I don't believe you would.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Miss Van Vetter is rich.\"\n\n\"And Mr. Richard Bartrow is only potentially so. That is a most\nexcellent reason, but I shouldn't let it overweigh common sense. From\nwhat Miss Elliott has said I infer that her cousin's fortune is not\nlarge enough to overawe the owner of a promising mine.\"\n\nBartrow's chair righted itself with a crash.\n\n\"That's the devil of it, Lansdale; that's just what scares me out. I've\nbeen pecking away in the Myriad for a year and a half now, and we're in\nsomething over four hundred feet--in rock, not ore. If we don't strike\npay in the immediate hence I'm a ruined community. I've borrowed right\nand left, and piled up debt enough to keep me in a cold sweat for the\nnext ten years. That's the chilly fact, and I leave it to you if I\nhadn't better take the night train and skip out for Topeka Mountain\nwithout going near Steve Elliott's.\"\n\nThe red-badges were passing again, and Lansdale took time to consider\nit. The appeal threw a new side-light on the character of the young\nminer, and Lansdale made mental apologies for having misjudged him.\nWhen he replied it was out of the heart of sincerity.\n\n\"It's a hard thing to say, but if you have stated the case impartially,\nI don't know but you would better do just that, Dick. From what I have\nseen of Miss Van Vetter, I should hazard a guess that the success or\nfailure of the Little Myriad wouldn't move her a hair's-breadth, but\nthat isn't what you have to consider.\"\n\n\"No.\" Bartrow said it from the teeth outward, looking at his watch.\n\"It's tough, but I guess you're right. I can just about make it if I\nget a quick move. Will you go down to the train with me?\"\n\nLansdale assented, and they walked the few squares to the Union Depot\nin silence. The narrow-gauge train was coupled and ready to leave, and\nBartrow tossed his handbag to the porter of the sleeping-car.\n\n\"You're a cold-blooded beggar, do you know it?\" he said, turning upon\nLansdale with as near an approach to petulance as his invincible\ngood-nature would sanction. \"Here I've lost a whole day and ridden a\nhundred and fifty miles just to get a sight of her, and now you won't\nlet me have it.\"\n\nLansdale laughed and promptly evaded the responsibility. \"Don't lay it\non my shoulders; I have sins enough of my own to answer for. It's a\nlittle hard, as you say, but it is your own suggestion.\"\n\n\"Is it? I don't know about that. It has been with me for a good while,\nbut it never knocked me quite out until I began to wonder what you'd\ndo in my place. That settled it. And you're not out of it by a large\nmajority. What are you going to tell them up at Elliott's?--about me, I\nmean.\"\n\n\"Why should I tell them anything?\"\n\n\"Because you can't help yourself. Elliott knows I'm in town,--knows we\nwere going to eat together. I met him on the way up to dinner.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll tell them anything you say.\"\n\n\"Thanks. Fix it up to suit yourself,--wired to come back on first\ntrain, or something of that sort. Anything'll do; anything but the\ntruth.\"\n\nLansdale's smile was inscrutable. He was thinking how impossible it\nwould be for the most accomplished dissembler to tell aught but the\ntruth with Constance Elliott's calm gray eyes upon him.\n\n\"I am afraid I shall make a mess of it.\"\n\n\"If you do, I'll come back and murder you. It's bad enough as it is.\nI've got a few days to go on, and I don't want them to know that the\njig is definitely up until it can't be helped.\"\n\n\"Then you'd better write a note and do your own lying,\" said Lansdale.\n\"I can spin fetching little fictions on paper and sign my name to them,\nbut I'm no good at the other kind.\"\n\nThe engine-bell clanged, putting the alternative out of the question.\n\n\"That lets me out,\" Bartrow said. \"You go up there and square it right\nfor me; savez? And say, Lansdale, old man; don't work yourself too\nhard. In spite of the lamb-ranch, you look thinner than usual, and\nthat's needless. Good-by.\"\n\nBartrow wrung his friend's hand from the steps of the Pullman, and\nLansdale laughed quite cheerfully.\n\n\"Don't you waste any sympathy on me,\" he said. \"I'm going to disappoint\nyou all and get well. Good-night; and success to the Little Myriad.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nLANSDALE stood watching the two red eyes on the rear platform of the\nsleeping-car until the curve on the farther side of the viaduct blotted\nthem out; after which he fell in with the tide of humanity ebbing\ncityward through the great arch of the station, and set out to do\nBartrow's errand at the house in Colfax Avenue.\n\nOn the way he found time to admire Bartrow's manliness. The little\ndeed of self-effacement promised a much keener sense of the eternal\nfitness of things than he had expected to come upon, in the young\nminer, or in any son of the untempered wilderness. Not that the\nwilderness was more mercenary than the less strenuous world of an\nolder civilization--rather the contrary; but if it gave generously it\nwas also prone to take freely. Lansdale wrought out the antithesis\nas a small concession to his own point of view, and was glad to set\nBartrow's self-abnegation over against it. Assuredly he would do what\na friendly man might toward making good the excuses of the magnanimous\none.\n\nIt was Miss Van Vetter who met him at the door, and he thought he\nsurprised a shadow of disappointment in her eyes when she welcomed him.\nBut it was Constance who said, \"Come in, Mr. Lansdale. Where is Dick?\"\n\nShe was holding the porti\u00c3\u00a8re aside for him, and he made sure of his\ningress before replying. Being of two minds whether to deny all\nprevious knowledge of such a person as Richard Bartrow, or to commit\nhimself recklessly to the hazards of equivocal explanations, he steered\na middle course.\n\n\"Am I my brother's keeper?\" he demanded, dropping into the easy-chair\nwhich had come to be called his by right of frequent occupancy.\n\n\"Oh, I hope you haven't murdered him!\" said Connie, with a show of\ntrepidation. \"That's a terribly suggestive quotation.\"\n\n\"So it is. But are not my hands clean?\" He held them up for inspection.\n\"How are you both this evening?\"\n\nConnie's eyes danced. \"Mr. Lansdale, do you happen to know anything\nabout the habits of the ostrich?\"\n\nLansdale acknowledged defeat, extending his hands in mock desperation.\n\"Put the thumbikins on if you must,\" he said, \"but don't screw them\ndown too hard. I couldn't tell anything but the truth if I should try.\"\n\n\"What have you done with Dick?\"\n\n\"I have murdered him, as you suggested, and put his remains in a trunk\nand shipped them East.\"\n\nMiss Van Vetter looked horrified, but whether at his flippancy or at\nthe hideous possibility, Lansdale could not determine.\n\n\"But, really,\" Connie persisted, with a look in her eyes which would\nhave exorcised any demon of brazenness; \"you dined with him, you know.\"\n\n\"So I did; but he had to go back to his mine on the night train. I saw\nhim off, and he made me promise to come here and--and\"--\n\n\"Square it?\" Connie suggested.\n\n\"That is precisely the word,--his word. And you will both bear me\nwitness that I have done it, won't you?\"\n\nMiss Van Vetter was cutting the leaves of a magazine, and she looked up\nto say: \"That is one of the explanations which doesn't explain, isn't\nit?\"\n\nLansdale collapsed in the depths of the chair. \"'I'm a poor unfort'net\nas don't know nothink,'\" he quoted. \"Tell me what you'd like to have me\nsay and I'll say it.\"\n\n\"Why did Mr. Bartrow have to go back so unexpectedly?\" asked Myra. \"He\ntold Uncle Stephen he would be in Denver two or three days.\"\n\nLansdale was not under bonds to keep the truthful peace at the behest\nof any eyes save those of Constance Elliott; wherefore he drew upon his\nimagination promptly, and, as it chanced, rather unfortunately.\n\n\"He had a telegram from his foreman about a--a strike, I think he\ncalled it.\"\n\n\"A strike in the Little Myriad!\" This from both of the young women\nin chorus. Then Connie thankfully: \"Oh, I'm so glad!\" and Myra\nvindictively: \"I hope he'll never give in to them!\"\n\nLansdale collapsed again. \"What have I done!\" he exclaimed.\n\nConstance set her cousin right, or tried to.\n\n\"It isn't a strike of the men; it's pay-ore--isn't it, Mr. Lansdale?\"\n\n\"Now how should I know?\" protested the amateur apologist. \"A strike is\na strike, isn't it? But I don't believe it was the good kind. He wasn't\nat all enthusiastic about it.\"\n\n\"That will do,\" said Connie. \"Poor Dick!\" And Miss Van Vetter, who was\nnot of the stony-hearted, rose and went to the piano that she might not\nadvertise her emotion.\n\nLansdale picked himself up out of the ruins of his attempt to do\nBartrow a good turn, and hoped the worst was over. It was for the\ntime; but later in the evening, when Myra had gone to the library for\na book they had been talking about, Connie returned to the unfinished\ninquisition.\n\n\"You know more than you have told us about Dick's trouble,\" she said\ngravely. \"Is it very serious?\"\n\n\"Yes, rather.\" Lansdale made a sudden resolve to cleave to the facts in\nthe case, telling as few of them as he might.\n\n\"It wasn't a strike at all, was it?\"\n\n\"No; that was a little figure of speech. It is rather the lack of a\nstrike--of the kind you meant.\"\n\n\"Poor boy! I don't wonder that it made him want to run away. He has\nworked so hard and so long, and his faith in the Little Myriad has been\nunbounded. What will he do?\"\n\n\"I don't know that. In fact, I think he is not quite at the brink of\nthings yet. But he is afraid it is coming to that.\"\n\n\"How did he talk? Is he very much discouraged? But of course he isn't;\nnothing discourages him.\"\n\nLansdale was looking into the compelling eyes and he forgot his\nr\u00c3\u00b4le,--forgot that he had been giving Constance to understand that the\nprospective failure of the mine was the only cloud in Bartrow's sky.\n\n\"I'm sorry I can't confirm that.\" He spoke hurriedly, hearing the\nrustle of Miss Van Vetter's skirts in the hall. \"He decided rather\nsuddenly,--to go back, you know. He intended coming here with me this\nevening. I don't think he had ever considered all the possibilities and\nconsequences; and we were talking it over. Then he decided not to come.\nHe is the soul of honor.\"\n\nConstance nodded intelligence, and made the proper diversion when her\ncousin came in with the book. But Miss Van Vetter had overheard the\nfinal sentence, and she put it away for future reference.\n\nLansdale said good-night a little later, and they both went to the door\nwith him. When he was gone Myra drew Connie into the library and made\nher sit down where the light from the shaded chandelier fell full upon\nher.\n\n\"Connie, dear,\" she began, fixing her cousin with an inquisitorial eye,\n\"who is 'the soul of honor'?\"\n\n\"It isn't nice to overhear things,\" said Connie pertly.\n\n\"I might retort that it isn't nice to have confidences with a gentleman\nthe moment your cousin's back is turned, but I sha'n't. Will you tell\nme what I want to know?\"\n\n\"We were talking about Dick.\"\n\nMyra's hands were clasped over her knee, and one daintily shod foot was\ntapping a tattoo on the rug. \"Was it anything that I ought not to know?\"\n\nConnie's pertness vanished, and the steadfast gray eyes brightened\nwith quick upwellings of sympathy. \"No, dear; it will doubtless be in\neverybody's mouth before many days. You remember what I told you once\nabout Dick's prospects?--that day we were on top of El Reposo?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, I think the Little Myriad isn't going to keep its promise; Dick\nthinks so.\"\n\nMyra sat quietly under it for a little while, and then got up to go to\nthe window. When she spoke she did not turn her head.\n\n\"He will be ruined, you said. What will you do, Connie?\"\n\n\"I? What can I do? Poppa would lend him more money, but he wouldn't\ntake it,--not from us.\"\n\nSilence while the bronze-figured clock on the mantel measured a full\nminute. Then:--\n\n\"There is one way you can make him take it.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\nMyra gave a quick glance over her shoulder, as if to make sure that her\ncousin was still sitting under the chandelier.\n\n\"He believes--and so does your father--that it is only a question of\ntime and more money. He couldn't refuse to take his wife's money.\"\n\nMiss Van Vetter heard a little gasp, which, to her strained sense,\nseemed to be more than half a sob, and the arc-light swinging from its\nwire across the avenue was blurred for her. Then Connie's voice, soft\nand low-pitched in the silence of the book-lined room, came to her as\nfrom a great distance.\n\n\"You are quite mistaken, Myra, dear; mistaken and--and very blind. Dick\nis my good brother,--the only one I ever had; not my father's son, but\nyet my brother. There has been no thought of anything else between us.\nBesides\"--\n\nMyra heard light footfalls and the rustle of drapery, and stole\nanother quick glance over her shoulder. The big pivot-chair under the\nchandelier was empty. The door into the hall was ajar, and Connie's\nface, piquant with suppressed rapture, was framed in the aperture.\n\n\"Besides, you good, dense, impracticable cuzzy, dear,--are you\nlistening?--Dick is head over ears in love with--you.\"\n\nThe door slammed softly on the final word, and there was a quick patter\nof flying feet on the stairs. Myra kept her place at the window; but\nwhen the arc-light had parted with its blurring aureole she drew the\nbig pivot-chair to the desk and sat down to write.\n\nWhat she had in mind seemed not to say itself readily, and there was\nquite a pyramid of waste paper in the basket before she had finished\nher two letters. She left them on the hall table when she went up\nto her room, and Connie found them in the morning on her way to the\nbreakfast-room to pour her father's coffee.\n\n\"I wish I might read them,\" she said, with the mischievous light\ndancing in her eyes. \"It's deliciously suspicious; a letter to Dick,\nand one to her man of business, all in a breath, and right on the\nheels of my little bomb-shell. If she ever tries to discipline me\nagain,--well, she'd better not, that's all.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\nTWO days after his return to the mine on Topeka Mountain, Bartrow\nreceived a letter. It came up from Alta Vista by the hands of one of\nthe workmen who had been down to the camp blacksmith shop with the\nday's gathering of dulled tools, and was considerably the worse for\nhandling when it reached its destination. Connie's monogram was on the\nflap of the envelope, but the address was not in Connie's handwriting.\nSo much Bartrow remarked while he was questioning the tool-carrier.\n\n\"Took you a good while, didn't it? Was Pat sober to-day?\"\n\n\"Naw; swimmin' full, same as usual.\"\n\n\"Spoil anything?\"\n\n\"Burnt up a drill 'r two, spite of all I could do. Laid off to lick me\nwhen he got through, but I lit out 'fore he got round to it.\"\n\n\"Did, eh? It's a pity; he's a good blacksmith if he'd only let whiskey\nalone. Try him in the morning next time, and maybe you'll catch him\nsober.\"\n\n\"Don't make any dif'rence 'bout the time o' day with him. He's full all\nthe time, he is.\"\n\nBartrow's curiosity was beginning to bestir itself, but he put it under\nfoot till he had climbed to the three-roomed cabin on the bench above\nthe tunnel-opening. Wun Ling was laying the table for supper, and the\nmaster of the mine sat down on the porch to read his letter. It was\nfrom Miss Van Vetter; and the glow on Bartrow's sunburned face as he\nread it was not altogether the ruddy reflection from the piled-up\nmasses of sunset crimson in the western sky.\n\n\"Dear Mr. Bartrow,\" she wrote: \"Mr. Lansdale has just been here, and\nwe made him tell us about your trouble, though he tried very hard not\nto. From which we infer that you didn't want us to know,--and that was\nwrong. If one cannot go to one's friends at such times, it is surely a\nvery thankless world.\n\n\"Constance told me some time ago that you might not be able to go on\nwith the Little Myriad without the investment of more capital, and I\nhave written about it to a friend of mine in the East who has money\nto invest. You may call it a most unwarrantable impertinence if you\nplease, but I'm not going to apologize for it,--not here. If you would\nreally like to humble me, I'll give you plenary indulgence when you\ncome to see us.\n\n\"I inclose my friend's Philadelphia address, and I may say with\nconfidence that I am quite sure he will help you if you will write him.\n\n\"We have abundant faith in you and in the Little Myriad. Don't think of\ngiving up, and please don't evade us when you are next in Denver.\"\n\nBartrow absorbed it by littles, and sat fingering the slip of paper\nwith the Philadelphia address on it, quite unheedful of Wun Ling's\nthrice-repeated announcement that supper was ready. It was his first\nletter from her, and the fact was easily subversive of presence of\nmind. Not until the lilt of it had a little outworn itself could he\nbring himself down to any fair-minded consideration of the offer of\nhelp. But when it finally came to that, he put the letter in his pocket\nand went in to supper, smiling ineffably and shaking his head as one\nwho has set his face flintwise against temptation.\n\nAn hour later, however, when he was smoking his pipe on the porch step,\nthe temptation beset him afresh. His faith in the ultimate success of\nthe mine had never wavered. It was unshaken even now, when he was at\nthe end of his resources, and a thing had happened which threatened to\ndemand a costly change in the method of exploiting the lode. But to be\nconfident for himself and for those who, knowing the hazard, had helped\nhim hitherto, was one thing; and to take a stranger's money was quite\nanother. And when the stranger chanced to be the friend of the woman\nhe loved, a person who would invest in the Little Myriad solely on the\nground of Miss Van Vetter's recommendation, the difference magnified\nitself until it took the shape of a prohibition.\n\nThe light had faded out of the western sky, and the peaks of the main\nrange stood out in shadowy relief against the star-dusted background.\nThe homely noises in Wun Ling's sanctum had ceased, and silence begirt\nthe great mountain. Bartrow tossed the extinct pipe through an open\nwindow, and began to pace the length of the slab-floored porch. It was\nnot in him to give up without another struggle; a final struggle, he\ncalled it, though none knew better that there is no final struggle for\na strong man save that which crowns perseverance with the chaplet of\nfruition. The temptation to grasp the hand held out to him was very\nsubtle. If Miss Van Vetter could have been eliminated--if only the\nproposal had come direct from the Philadelphia capitalist, instead of\nthrough her.\n\nThe sound of footsteps on the gravel at the tunnel's mouth broke into\nhis reverie, and the figure of a man loomed dimly in the darkness at\nthe foot of the path leading up to the cabin. It was McMurtrie, the\nmining engineer in charge of the Big Bonanza at Alta Vista. Bartrow\ncalled down to him.\n\n\"Is that you, Mac? Don't come up; I'll be with you in a second.\"\n\nThe engineer sat down on a tool-box and waited.\n\n\"I'm a little late,\" he said, when Bartrow came down the path. \"It's\npay-day at the Bonanza. Get a lamp and let's go in and have a look at\nyour new grief.\"\n\n\"You didn't need to tramp up here in the dark,\" Bartrow rejoined,\nfeeling in a niche in the timbering for a miner's lamp. \"I'd given you\nup for to-night.\"\n\n\"Oh, I said I'd come, and I'm here. I know how it feels to be on the\nragged edge,--been there myself. Is that the best lamp you could find?\nIt isn't much better than a white bean. Pick it up a little higher so I\ncan see the wet spots. It's too chilly to go in swimming to-night.\"\n\nThey were picking their way through the damp tunnel, Bartrow ahead\nwith the lamp held high. The \"new grief\" was an apparent change in the\ndirection of the ore-bearing crevice from its slight inclination upward\nto a sharp pitch downward; and Bartrow had asked McMurtrie to come up\nand look at it.\n\nIn the heading the engineer took the lamp and made a careful\nexamination of the rock face of the cutting, tracing the outline of the\nvein with the flame of the lamp, and picking off bits of the shattered\nrock to determine the lines of cleavage. Bartrow stood aside and waited\nfor the verdict; waited with a tense thrill of nervousness which was\nquite new to him; and the monotonous drip-drip of the water percolating\nthrough the tunnel roof magnified itself into a din like the ringing of\nhammers upon an anvil.\n\n\"Well, what do you say?\" he queried, when the engineer made an end and\nbegan to fill his pipe.\n\n\"You're in for it, Dick,--here, hold this lamp a minute, will you? It's\na pretty well-defined dip in the formation, and I'm afraid it has come\nto stay. That means an incline.\"\n\nThe echo took up Bartrow's ironical laugh and gave it back in mocking\nreiteration.\n\n\"Yes; an incline at the end of a four-hundred-and-forty-foot tunnel,\nand a steam hoist, and a pumping outfit, and a few other little\nknickknacks. Say a couple of thousand dollars or so before I can turn a\nwheel.\"\n\nMcMurtrie bent to light his pipe at the flame of the lamp. \"That's\nabout the size of it. Hold that lamp still, can't you?\"\n\n\"Hold it yourself,\" retorted Bartrow; and he took a turn in the\ndarkness to steady his nerves. When he stumbled back into the dim\nnimbus of lamplight he had fought and won his small battle.\n\n\"Don't lay it up against me, Mac,\" he said, in blunt contrition. \"It\nknocked me out for a minute. You know I've been backing my luck here\nfor all I'm worth.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know that. What will you do now?\"\n\n\"Quit; come off the perch; shut up shop and pull down the blinds. It's\nall there is to do.\"\n\n\"And give it up?\"\n\n\"And give it up. Bank's broke; or at least it will be when I've paid\nthe men another time or two.\"\n\nMcMurtrie had Scotch blood in his veins, and was cannily chary of\noffering unasked advice. None the less, he did it.\n\n\"I'd borrow a little more nerve and go on, if it were mine.\"\n\n\"So would I if I could.\"\n\n\"Can't you?\"\n\nBartrow said \"no,\" changed it to \"yes,\" and then qualified the assent\nuntil it, too, became a negation.\n\n\"It's a pity,\" was the engineer's comment. \"I believe another hundred\nfeet would let you in for a decently good thing.\"\n\n\"So do I. But it might as well be a thousand. I know when I'm downed.\"\n\nMcMurtrie scoffed openly at that, taking his pipe from his mouth to\nsay: \"That's the one thing you don't know. You'll chew on it a while\nand go to Denver; and in a day or so your men will get orders to go on.\nI've seen you downed before. Why don't you go back East and marry a\nrich girl? That's the way to develop a mine.\"\n\nIt was a random shot, but it went so near the mark that Bartrow winced,\nand was thankful that the flaring miner's lamp was not an arc-light.\nAnd his rejoinder ignored the matrimonial suggestion.\n\n\"You're off wrong this time, Mac. I wish you didn't have to be. But\nit's no use. I'm in debt till I can't see out over the top of it, and\nI couldn't raise another thousand on the Myriad if I should try,--that\nis, not in Colorado. If I go to Denver it'll be to turn over my\ncollateral and let everybody down as easy as I can.\"\n\n\"Then don't go yet a while.\"\n\nBartrow took the lamp and led the way out of the tunnel.\n\n\"I did mean to stand it off to the last minute,\" he said, when they\nwere once more under the stars, \"but I don't know as it's worth while\nnow. Will you come up to the shack and smoke a few lines? No? Then\nwait till I get my coat and I'll walk down to camp with you. I want to\ndo a little wiring before I turn in.\"\n\nThey parted at the railway station above the camp at the foot of\nBonanza Mountain, and Bartrow went in to send his message. In the hour\nof defeat he yearned, manlike, for sympathy; and it was to Connie that\nhis cry went out. Notwithstanding the earnestness of it, the appeal was\nconsistently characteristic in its wording.\n\n\"I'm hunting sympathy. Can you give me a lonesome hour or two if I come\ndown? Answer while I wait.\"\n\nHe asked the night operator to rush it, and sat down with his feet on\nthe window-sill to smoke out the interval. A half-hour later, when the\noperator was jogging Denver for a reply to his \"rush,\" the din of an\naffray floated up to the open window from the camp in the gulch. The\noperator came to the window and looked down upon the twinkling lights\nof the town.\n\n\"That's the blacksmith again,\" he said. \"He's been on a steady bat for\ntwo weeks, and the camp isn't big enough to hold him.\"\n\n\"He'll kill himself, if he don't mind,\" Bartrow prophesied. \"He's raw\nyet, and hasn't found out that a man can't stand the drink up here that\nhe could in the valley.\"\n\n\"No. Doc said he had a touch of the jimmies last night. He yelled for\nhis daughter till they heard him up at the shaft-house of the Bonanza.\nMcMurtrie said\"--But what the engineer's commentary had been was lost\nto Bartrow, since the clicking sounder was snipping out the reply to\nthe \"rush\" message.\n\nThe operator wrote it out and handed it to Bartrow. The answer was as\ncharacteristic as the appeal.\n\n    \"Two of the three of us go to Boulder to-morrow to return by\n    the late train. The other one is most sympathetic. Come.\n\n                                                      \"CONNIE.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\nON the long day-ride from Alta Vista to Denver, Bartrow dwelt upon\nMyra's letter until the hopefulness of it took possession of him,\nurging him to reconsider his determination to give up the fight on\nthe Little Myriad. That which seems to have fortified itself beyond\nperadventure of doubt in the night season is prone to open the door\nto dubiety in the morning; and the hope which McMurtrie's verdict had\nquenched came to life again, setting the mill of retrieval agrind,\nthough, apart from the suggestion in Myra's letter, there was little\nenough for grist.\n\nFrom admitting the hope to considering ways and means was but a step in\nthe march of returning confidence; and, setting aside Myra's proposal\nas an alternative which would bring victory at the expense of the cause\nin which the battle was fought, he was moved to break his promise to\nhimself and to ask help of Stephen Elliott. This decision was not\nreached without a day-long struggle, in which pride and generosity\nfought shoulder to shoulder against the apparent necessity. The pioneer\nhad more than once offered to back the promise of the Little Myriad;\nbut Bartrow, knowing Elliott's weakness in the matter of money keeping,\nhad steadily refused to open another door of risk to the old man\nwho had fathered him from boyhood, and whose major infirmity was an\nopen-handed willingness to lend to any borrower.\n\nBut the necessity was most urgent. Bartrow rehearsed the condoning\nfacts and set them over against his promise to himself. If he should\ngive up the fight the Little Myriad would be lost, he would be left\nhopelessly in debt, and the beatific vision, with Miss Van Vetter\nfor its central figure, vanished at once into the limbo of things\nunrealizable. Moreover, the investment would be less hazardous for\nthe pioneer than at any previous time in the history of the mine.\nNotwithstanding the discouragements, it was a heartening fact that the\nore-bearing vein was steadily widening; and the last mill-run assay,\nmade a week before, had shown a cheering increase in value.\n\nBartrow weighed the pros and cons for the twentieth time while the\ntrain was speeding over the ultimate mile of the long run, and finally\nyielded to the importunate urgings of the necessity. The first step was\nto take Connie into his confidence; and when the train reached Denver\nhe hurried to the hotel, full of the new hope and eager to begin the\ncampaign of retrieval. While he was inscribing his name in the register\nthe clerk asked a question.\n\n\"Just come down from the range, Mr. Bartrow?\"\n\n\"Yes. Can you give me my old room?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\" The clerk wrote the number opposite the name. \"What do\nthey say up in the carbonate camp about the Lodestar business?\"\n\n\"The Lodestar? I don't know. I haven't been in Leadville. I came down\nfrom the Bonanza district on the other line. Anything broke loose?\"\n\n\"Haven't you heard? The big producer is played out.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Fact; struck a 'lime horse' two weeks ago, and they've been keeping it\ndark and unloading the stock right and left. You are not in it, I hope?\"\n\nBartrow was not, but he knew that Elliott was; knew, too, that in any\nunloading _sauve qui peut_ the old pioneer would most likely be one of\nthose found dead in the deserted trenches. Wherefore he slurred his\nsupper and hastened out to the house in Colfax Avenue, not to ask help,\nas he had prefigured, but to ascertain if there were not some way in\nwhich a broken man might tender it.\n\nThere was a light in the library and none in the parlor; and Bartrow,\nbeing rather more a brevet member of Stephen Elliott's family than a\nvisitor, nodded to the servant who admitted him, hung up his coat and\nhat, and walked unannounced into the lighted room. When he discovered\nthat the library held but one occupant, that the shapely head bending\nover a book in the cone of light beneath the reading-lamp was not\nConnie's, he realized the magnitude of Connie's duplicity, and\nequanimity forsook him.\n\nMiss Van Vetter shut her finger in her book and smiled as if his sudden\nappearance were quite a matter of course.\n\n\"I hoped you would come,\" she said. \"Have you been to dinner?\"\n\nThe prosaic question might have enabled a less ingenuous man to cover\nhis discomposure with some poor verbal mantle of commonplace or what\nnot; but Bartrow could only murmur \"Good Lord!\" sinking therewith into\nthe hollow of the nearest chair because his emotion was too great to be\nborne standing.\n\nSince she was not a party to Connie's small plot, Myra was left to\ninfer that her visitor was ill, and she rose in sympathetic concern.\n\n\"Why, Mr. Bartrow! is anything the matter? Shall I get you something? a\nglass of wine, or\"--\n\nBartrow shook his head and besought her with both hands to sit down\nagain. \"No, nothing, thank you; it's miles past that sort of mending.\nDo you--do you happen to know where your cousin is?\"\n\n\"Why, yes; she has gone to Boulder with Uncle Stephen.\"\n\n\"I--I thought you were going,\" Bartrow stammered.\n\nIt did not occur to Miss Van Vetter to wonder why he should have\nthought anything about it.\n\n\"I thought so myself, up to the last moment,\" she rejoined.\n\nBartrow leaned forward with his hands on his knees.\n\n\"Miss Myra, would you--do you mind telling me why you didn't go?\" He\nsaid it with reproachful gravity.\n\nMiss Van Vetter's poise was an inheritance which had lost nothing in\ntransmission, but the unconscious reproach in his appeal overset it.\nUnder less trying conditions her laugh would have emancipated him; but\nbeing still in the bonds of unreadiness, he could only glower at her\nin a way which lacked nothing of hostility save intention, and say, \"I\nshould think you might tell me what you're laughing at!\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing--nothing at all. Only one would think you were sorry I\ndidn't go. Are you?\"\n\n\"You know well enough I'm not.\" This time the reproach was not\nunconscious. \"But you haven't answered my question. I have a horrible\nsuspicion, and I want to know.\"\n\n\"It was Connie's mistake. I was to meet them at the station at half\npast four--I am sure she said half past four--and when I went down I\nfound the train had been gone an hour. Did you ever hear of such a\nthing?\"\n\nMiss Van Vetter did not know that the small arch-plotter had\nexhausted her ingenuity trying to devise some less primitive means of\naccomplishing her purpose; but Bartrow gave Connie full credit for act\nand intention.\n\n\"She'd do worse things than that; she wouldn't stick at anything to\ncarry her point,\" he said unguardedly.\n\nMyra laughed again. \"I hope you don't ask me to believe that she did it\npurposely,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh, no; of course not. I don't ask you to believe anything--except\nthat I'm foolishly glad you missed the train,\" rejoined the downright\none, beginning to find himself.\n\n\"Are you, really? I was almost ready to doubt it.\"\n\nBartrow was not yet fit to measure swords of repartee with any one,\nleast of all with Miss Van Vetter, and the quicksand of speechlessness\nengulfed him. His helplessness was so palpable that it presently\nbecame infectious, and Myra was dismayed to find herself growing\nsympathetically self-conscious. Her letter lay between their last\nmeeting and this, and she began to wonder if that were the barrier.\nWhen the silence became portentous, Bartrow gathered himself for\nanother dash toward enlargement. It was that or asphyxia. The very air\nof the room was heavy with the narcosis of embarrassment.\n\n\"Your letter came yesterday,\" he began abruptly.\n\n\"Did it? And you have come to tell me to--to tell me to mind my own\nbusiness? as I said you might?\"\n\n\"No, indeed, I haven't. But I can't do it, all the same--drag your\nfriend in on the Myriad.\"\n\n\"Was Mr. Lansdale mistaken? Don't you need more capital to go on with?\"\n\n\"Need it?--well, yes; rather. But I can't take your Mr. Grimsby's\nmoney.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because\"--the low-pitched hollow of the big lounging-chair seemed to\nput him at a disadvantage, and he struggled up out of it to tramp back\nand forth before her--\"well, in the first place, because he _is_ your\nfriend; and if he wasn't, I have no security to offer him--collateral,\nI suppose he'd call it.\"\n\n\"He is not exactly my friend, within your meaning of the word; and he\nwill not ask you to secure him.\"\n\nHe stopped and looked down upon her. She was shading her eyes from the\nsheen of the reading-lamp and turning the leaves of the book.\n\n\"What does he know about the Little Myriad? anything more than you have\ntold him?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And yet you say he is willing to put up money on it?\"\n\n\"He is ready to help you--yes.\"\n\nBartrow's brows went together in a frown of perplexity. \"As long as I'm\nnot going to let him, I suppose I haven't any right to ask questions,\nbut\"--\n\nShe put the book on the table and looked up at him with something of\nConnie's steadfastness in her eyes.\n\n\"Perhaps I was foolish to try to make even such a small mystery of it;\nbut I thought--I was so anxious to--to put it in such a way as to\"--\n\nThe words would not discover themselves; and Bartrow, to whom the\nmystery was now no mystery, helped her over the obstruction.\n\n\"As to make it easy for me. I think I catch on, after so long a time.\nMr. Grimsby is your business manager, isn't he?\"\n\n\"My solicitor; yes.\"\n\n\"That's what I meant. And it was going to be your own money?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe met her gaze with a smile of mingled triumph and admiration.\n\n\"It was a close call, and you'll never know how near I came to falling\ndown,\" he said. \"It was a fearful temptation.\"\n\nThe pencilled brows went up with a little arch of interrogation between\nthem.\n\n\"A temptation? Why do you call it that?\"\n\nBartrow was slowly coming to his own in the matter of unconstraint.\n\"If you had ever dabbled in mineral, you'd know. When a fellow gets in\nabout so deep, he'd foreclose the mortgage on his grandfather's farm\nto get money to go on with. I didn't read between the lines in your\nletter. I thought the Philadelphia man was some friend of yours who was\ninterested in a general way, and the temptation to fall on his neck and\nweep was almost too much for me.\"\n\n\"You still call it a temptation.\"\n\n\"It was just that, and nothing less. I had the toughest kind of a fight\nwith myself before I could say no, and mean it.\"\n\n\"But why should you say no? You believe in the Little Myriad, don't\nyou?\"\n\n\"Sure. But that's for myself--and for a few people who knew the size of\nthe risk when they staked me. So far as I've gone with it, it's only\na big game of chance; and I wouldn't let you put your money into it\nunless I knew it was the surest kind of a sure thing.\"\n\n\"Not if I believe in it, too? Not if I am willing to take the chances\nthat you and the others have taken?\" Myra conceived that her mistake\nlay in putting it upon the ground of a purely business transaction, and\nchanged front with truly feminine adroitness. \"Won't you let me have\njust a tiny share of it? Enough so that when I go back to Philadelphia\nI can say that I am interested in a mine? I should think you might.\nI'll promise to be the most tractable and obedient stockholder you\nhave.\"\n\nShe made the plea like a spoiled child begging for a toy, but there\nwas no mistaking the earnestness of it. Bartrow felt his fine\ndetermination oozing, and was moved to tramp again, making a circuit\nof the entire room this time, and saying to himself with many emphatic\nrepetitions that it could not be possible,--that her motive was only\ncharitable,--that he was nothing more to her than Connie's friend. When\nhe spoke again his circlings had brought him to the back of her chair.\n\n\"You're making it fearfully hard for me, and the worst of it is that\nyou don't seem to know it. You think I am a mining crank, like all the\nrest of them, and so I am; but there was method in my madness. I never\ncared overmuch for money until I came to know what it is to love a\nwoman who has too much of it.\"\n\nThere was manifestly no reply to be made to such a pointless speech as\nthis, and when he resumed his circumambulatory march she began to turn\nthe leaves of the book again. When it became evident that he was not\ngoing to elucidate, she said, \"Meaning Connie?\"\n\n\"No, not meaning Connie.\" He had drifted around to the back of her\nchair again. \"I wish you'd put that book away for a few minutes. It\nowls me.\"\n\n\"I will, if you will stop circling about and talking down on me from\nthe ceiling. It's dreadfully distressing.\"\n\nHe laughed and drew up a chair facing her; drew it up until the arm of\nit touched hers.\n\n\"It's a stand-off,\" he said, with cheerful effrontery; \"only I didn't\nmean my part of it. Let's see, where were we? You said, 'Meaning\nConnie,' and I said, 'No, not meaning Connie.' I meant some one else.\nUntil I met her, the Little Myriad was merely a hole in the ground,\nnot so very different from other holes in the ground except that it\nwas mine--and it wasn't the Little Myriad then, either. After that, it\ngot its name changed, and its mission, too. From that day its business\nwas to make it possible for me to go to her and say, 'I love you; you,\nyourself, and not your money. I've money enough of my own.'\"\n\nShe heard him through with the face of a graven image. \"And now?\"\n\n\"And now I can't do it; I can never do it, I'm afraid. The Little\nMyriad has gone back on me, and I'm nearer flat broke to-day than I've\never been.\"\n\n\"But this unfortunate young person who has too much money--she is\nyoung, isn't she?--has she nothing to say about it?\"\n\nBartrow answered his own thought rather than her question. \"She\ncouldn't be happy with everybody saying she'd staked her husband.\"\n\n\"Has she told you that?\"\n\n\"No; but it's so,--you know it's so.\"\n\nBartrow was no juggler in figures of speech, and his fictitious third\nperson threatened to become unmanageable.\n\nHer smile was good to look upon. \"I don't know anything of the kind. I\nthink she would be very foolish to let such an absurd thing make her\nunhappy--supposing any one should be unkind enough to say it.\"\n\n\"They would say it, and I'd hear of it; and then there'd be trouble.\"\n\n\"But you say you love her; isn't your love strong enough to rise above\nsuch things? You think the sacrifice would be hers, but it wouldn't; it\nwould be yours.\"\n\n\"I don't see how you make that out.\"\n\nMyra's heart sank within her. It hurt her immeasurably to be driven to\nplead her own cause, but the money-fact was inexorable; and the look in\nBartrow's eyes was her warrant when she dared to read it.\n\n\"Oh, can't you see?\" The words wrought themselves into a plea, though\nshe strove to say them dispassionately. \"If it touch your self-respect\never so little, the sacrifice is all yours.\"\n\nThat point of view was quite new to Bartrow. He took time to think it\nout, but when the truth clinched itself he went straight to the mark.\n\n\"I never saw that side of it before--don't quite see it now. But if you\ndo, that's different. It's you, little woman; and I do love you--you,\nyourself, and not your money. I wish I could go on and say the rest of\nit, but I can't. Will you take me for better or for worse--with an even\nchance that it's going to be all worse and no better?\"\n\nHer eyes filled with quick tears, and her voice was tremulous. \"It\nwould serve you right if I should say no; you've fairly made me beg you\nto ask me!\"\n\nHer hand was on the arm of the chair, and he possessed himself of it\nand raised it to his lips with gentle reverence.\n\n\"You'll have to begin making allowances for me right at the start,\" he\nsaid humbly. \"When I make any bad breaks you must remember it's because\nI don't know any better, and that away down deep under it all I love\nyou well enough to--to go to jail for you. Will you wait for me while I\nskirmish around and try to get on my feet again?\"\n\n\"No\"--with sweet petulance.\n\n\"There it is, you see; another bad break right on top of the first.\nSuppose you talk a while and let me listen. I'm good at listening.\"\n\n\"I'll wait, if you want me to,--and if you will let me help you to go\non with the Little Myriad.\"\n\nBartrow's laugh had a ring of boyish joy in it.\n\n\"Back to the old cross-roads, aren't we? I'll let you in on it now; but\nif you take the mine you'll have to take the man along with the other\nincumbrances,--simultaneously, so to speak.\"\n\n\"I thought you were anxious to wait.\"\n\n\"If you were as poor as I am, I'd ask you to make it high noon\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"Oh! the money again. Can't we put it aside, once for all? There isn't\nso much of it as you may imagine.\"\n\nBartrow overleaped the barrier at a bound.\n\n\"Then let's make it noon to-morrow. If we are going to push the Myriad\nI ought to go back to-morrow night.\"\n\nShe tried to scoff at him, but there was love in her eyes.\n\n\"Connie said once that you were Young-man-afraid-of-his-horses, but she\ndoesn't know you. I believe you more than half mean it.\"\n\n\"I do mean it. If I sit here and look at you much longer I shall be\nbegging you to make it nine o'clock instead of twelve. Don't ask me to\nwait very long. It'll be hard enough to go off and leave you afterward.\nIt's a good bit more than a hundred miles in a straight line from\nDenver to Topeka Mountain.\"\n\n\"I'm going with you,\" she said calmly.\n\n\"You?--to live in a wicky-up on the side of a bald mountain? But you\nknow what it is; you've been there. You'd die of the blues in a week.\"\n\n\"Would I?\" She rose and stood beside his chair. \"You don't know much\nabout me, yet, do you? If the 'wicky-up' is good enough for you, it\nis good enough for me. I am going with you, and I'm going to make\nthat dear little log cabin a place that you will always be glad to\nremember,--if I can.\"\n\nHe drew her down on the arm of the chair.\n\n\"Don't talk to me that way, Myra,--you mustn't, you know. I'm not used\nto it, and it breaks me all up. If you say another word I shall want to\nmake it seven o'clock in the morning instead of nine.\"\n\n\"Can you wait a month?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Three weeks?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nShe gave up in despair. \"You are dreadfully unreasonable.\"\n\n\"I know it; I was born that way and I can't help it. I sha'n't insist\non to-morrow, because I'm not sure that Wun Ling has anything for us to\neat; but one week from to-morrow, when I've had time to stock up and\nstraighten up a bit, is going to be the limit. Can you make it?\"\n\n\"What if I say no?\"\n\n\"I shall come anyway.\"\n\nShe bent over until her lips touched his forehead.\n\n\"That is your answer, only you don't deserve it. And now will you\nanswer my question? I asked you when you came in if you had been to\ndinner, and you said 'Good Lord!'\"\n\n\"Did I? I think I must have been a bit rattled. You see, I'd just heard\nsome bad news, and I was expecting to find Connie, and wasn't expecting\nto find you.\"\n\n\"Did Connie write you she would meet you?\"\n\nHe had one hand free to fish out the day-old telegram and give it to\nher. She read it with a swift blush crimsoning cheek and neck.\n\n\"The unscrupulous little tyke!\" she said; and then, with self-defensive\ntact: \"But you said you had bad news.\"\n\n\"Yes. A mine that our good old Uncle Steve is pretty deeply into has\ngone dry.\"\n\n\"Failed, you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's it. I wish you'd teach me how to talk English,--good clean\nEnglish, like yours. Connie has tried it, but pshaw! she's worse than\nI am. But about the Lodestar: I don't know how deep the old man is\nin; he's such an innocent old infant about putting up money that I'm\nawfully afraid they have salted him. You must pump Connie and find out.\nI'll be in Leadville to-morrow night, and if there is anything to be\ndone on the ground I'll do it. The old man has been a second father to\nme.\"\n\nMyra promised, and went back once more to the unanswered dinner query.\n\n\"Now you remind me of it, I believe I haven't been to dinner,\" he\nadmitted. \"But that's nothing; a meal or two more or less isn't to be\nmentioned at such a time as this.\"\n\n\"I am going to get you something.\"\n\n\"No, don't; I'm too happy to eat.\"\n\nBut she insisted, and when she came back with a dainty luncheon on a\ntea-tray he did ample justice to it, if for no better reason than that\nshe sat on the other side of the small reading-table and made tea for\nhim.\n\nAfterward, when the time drew near for the Elliotts' return, he took\nhis leave, though it was yet early.\n\n\"They are the best friends I have on earth,\" he said, when Myra went\nto the door with him, \"but somehow, I feel as if I didn't want to meet\nanybody I know,--not to-night. I want to have it all to myself for a\nfew hours.\"\n\nShe laughed at that; a laugh with an upbubbling of content and pure\nhappiness in it; and sent him off with his heart afire. When he was\nhalfway down the walk she recalled him. He came back obediently.\n\n\"It will cost you something every time you do that,\" he protested,\nexacting the penalty. \"Was that what you wanted?\"\n\n\"Of course not! I merely wanted to ask you what it is to 'owl' a\nperson. You said I 'owled' you.\"\n\n\"Did I? Well, you don't; you never can. That is the best definition I\ncan think of: something you can never do to me. May I say good-night\nagain? the way I did a minute ago?\"\n\nThe glare of the arc-light swinging between its poles across the avenue\nwas quite ruthless, and there were passers-by in straggling procession\non the sidewalk. But at the critical instant the kindly incandescence\nburned blue, clicked, fizzed, and died down to a red spot in the\ndarkness. For which cause Bartrow presently went his way, with the\nheart-fire upblazing afresh; and when Myra won back to the library and\nthe cosy depths of the great chair, the color scheme of fair neck and\ncheek and brow was not altogether the reflection from the crimson shade\nof the reading-lamp.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nCONSTANCE TO MYRA\n\n\nMY DEAR LADY BOUNTIFUL: Your letter--the ridiculous one--came\nyesterday. The idea of your proposing in the very morning of your\nhoney-month to take the Colfax Avenue house and turn it into a home for\nindigent relatives! As Tommie would put it, \"Wot are you givin' us!\"\n\nBut seriously, cuzzy dear, it's quite out of the question. Papa\nwouldn't hear to it, and besides, we are getting along very cosily\nnow, re-learning a good many lessons that prosperity makes one forget.\nOne of them is that gratitude isn't quite like the dodo,--gone into\nfossilistic extinction, you know.\n\nMargaret Gannon is one of the instances. She has taken a room in our\nblock, and there is no limit to her great Irish tender-heartedness. If\nI'd let her, she would make me sit down and hold my hands while she\ndoes the housework of our three rooms. In spite of all I can say or\ndo, she does do a great deal of it; and I can hear her sewing-machine\nbuzzing deep into the night to pay for it.\n\nTommie is another. The day we moved down here from the old home in\nColfax Avenue that \"irreclaimable little savage,\" as you once called\nhim, brought me his surplus of a dollar and something and asked me to\n\"blow it in\" for him. Think of it and weep, you luxury-spoiled darling!\nI could have hugged him, dirt and all. And since that day he has been\nmy Ariel, in more ways than you would think possible. He is so sharp\nand keen-witted; and his philanthropy has developed into a passion.\n\nMr. Lansdale has been most kind. That is the proper phrase, I believe,\nbut now that I have written it down it seems trite and meaningless.\nIf I say that he has fairly earned the right to sign himself \"Robert\nLansdale, Gentleman,\" you will understand. The change in our\ncircumstances has been a test that he alone of all our friends has\nbeen able to endure unmoved. I don't say that others are not kind and\nsympathetic, but they are--well, they are different. Now that I can\nsay it without hurting you, I'll admit that I've always had a good\nbit of contempt for culture of the imported variety (I think I have\nbeen spelling it \"culchah\"), but Mr. Lansdale has converted me. It is\nworth something to be able to rise superior to circumstances,--the\ncircumstances of others, I mean,--and, between us two, it's a virtue to\nwhich we new people haven't quite attained.\n\nI presume you read the Denver papers, and if you do you know all I\ncould tell you about the person whom you once said was better worth\nsaving than other people. Mr. Lansdale, who was one of the original\ntrio, you remember, talks very sparingly of Mr. Jeffard; from which I\ninfer that there isn't much to be said,--in mixed company. The newly\narrived one lives in an apartment building, and papa says they are\nbeginning to call him a miser on the street. They'd say that of any\ncapitalist who wouldn't invest in at least one \"ground-floor\" a day;\nbut I think you will agree with me that they can't say anything worse\nthan the truth about him. I haven't had the ill-chance to meet him yet\n(I hope I'll be spared that), but I am afraid Tommie has been spying\nupon him,--for reasons of his own which he won't explain. I happened\nto overhear the final volley of a small battle royal between my Ariel\nand Margaret the other day, which had in it a hint of an unnamable\nthing,--a thing which involves Margaret and the unworthy one. You may\nremember that he once posed as her _deus ex machina_. And she has grown\ndangerously beautiful in her year of uprightness.\n\nWhen you write, tell me all about your plans for the summer; and\nbelieve me always\n\n                                   Your cousin-content,\n                                               CONNIE.\n\n\nMYRA TO CONSTANCE\n\nDEAR CONNIE: Really, the S. P. C. C. ought to take you in hand! To\nthink of the cold-blooded way in which you hoodwinked us up to the\nvery last moment, making us believe that the Lodestar involvement was\nnext to nothing, and keeping the home intact solely for the purpose\nof providing a proper stage-setting for the final act of our little\ncomedy-drama! It's fairly heart-breaking; the more since you won't let\nus share with you, as we'd be glad to. Before you saw fit to confide\nin us, Dick had used every argument short of a pick-handle to convince\nme that I should presently go back to Denver and creature comforts,\nleaving him here to go on delving in the Myriad. I only laughed at\nhim, but I'll recant if you will listen to reason, and let me make a\nhome for you and Uncle Stephen. But as between living a three-quarter\nwidow in Denver on mere visiting terms with you and your father, and\nhibernating here with Dick, you may be sure I shall choose the latter.\n\nWe are both as enthusiastic as can be over the prospects of the mine.\nThe new machinery is on the way, and we are down twenty feet on the\nincline. Another month will surely carry it into pay-rock. (You see I\nam learning to talk \"mineral-English\" with the best of them.) Under the\ncircumstances, I don't blame Dick for wanting to stay right here every\nday; and it won't be so lonesome for me as you may imagine. You see I\nhave Dick, and he can be a whole cityful upon occasion.\n\nYou wouldn't know \"The Eyrie\" (Dick says the altitude is so great that\nwe had to have a high-sounding name) since we have begun to remodel it.\nWe are to have another room, a larger kitchen for Wun Ling (oh, he is a\ncelestial treasure!--quite the archangel of the culinary host), a huge\nchimney, with immense fireplaces, against a possible winter here, and a\nwider porch,--board-floored, if you please. And inside I have rugged\nand porti\u00c3\u00a8red, and pictured and bric-a-bracked, until the pristine\nbarkiness of the place is all but effaced.\n\nSo far, with the exception of an occasional call from Mr. McMurtrie, we\nhave been \"each other's own best company;\" but if I stay up all summer\nit will be conditional upon your and Uncle Stephen's spending at least\na month with us when the hot weather makes your block uncomfortable.\nDon't say no beforehand, unless you want to make me quite disgusted.\n\nMr. Lansdale is a lineal descendant in the direct line of the\nChevalier,--the _sans peur et sans reproche_ one; you know I've always\nsaid that of him. It chokes me when I think of what is lying in wait\nfor him. Isn't there the least little glimmer of hope? He looked so\nbright and eager on our wedding day that I could almost make myself\nbelieve he was going to get well. You must be very, very careful,\nConnie dear; not to encourage him too much, I mean; not unless you--but\nI sha'n't say it without your warrant.\n\nWhat you say about Margaret Gannon's Irish true-heartedness reminds me\nof our own wild Irishman. He is the mine blacksmith, a perfect Sheridan\nfor wit and repartee when he is sober, and a maniac of maniacs when\nhe is drunk,--which happens whenever Dick relaxes his vigilance for a\nsingle hour.\n\nThe other day Pat (if he has any other name I've never heard it) did\na thing heroic. They are using dynamite in the tunnel, and after the\nnoon blasts one of the miners went in before the deadly gas had been\nproperly \"ventilated\" out. One of the others saw him stumble and go\nheadlong down the incline, and the cry went back to the entrance. Pat\nheard it (he was sober that day), flung his tools to the four winds,\ndashed into the pit of death, and came out black in the face, but with\nthe man on his shoulder, just as Dick got down to the entrance. Wasn't\nthat fine?\n\nAs you surmise, we have read all that the newspapers are saying about\nMr. Jeffard. Isn't it queer that he should develop into a millionaire\nmiser! Dick has told me a great deal about him,--at least about the Mr.\nJeffard he used to know,--and whatever sins he may have had to answer\nfor in those days, avarice was not one of them. I suppose it is another\ncase of money-spoiling, but I can't help wanting to doubt your latest\nsuspicion of him. I read your letter to Dick, and he shook his head\nwhen I came to that part; said he couldn't believe it, even on your\ntestimony,--that the man might be capable of all sorts of villainy,\nbut not that. So I am going over to Dick's point of view far enough to\nask you not to be too hard upon the \"unworthy one\" just because he is\nno longer one of your poverty-stricken sinners,--he _was_ that once,\nwasn't he? The rich sinners need charity quite as really as the poor;\nof a different kind, to be sure, and not always as easy to exercise as\nthe other, but none the less necessary.\n\nThis is all you are going to get to-night. Dick has just come up from\nthe mine, and he says I sha'n't write any more whatever.\n\n                                   Your loving cousin,\n                                                   MYRA.\n\n\nLANSDALE TO BARTROW\n\nMY DEAR RICHARD:--What with a mine for a taskmaster and a wife for your\nleisure I can fancy you tossing this letter aside unopened. But the\npromise which you exacted is herein kept, and it must plead my excuse\nfor breaking into your honeymoon with a few pages of barren gossip.\n\nFirst, as to Miss Elliott and her good father. Your foreboding went\nnearer the mark than the ostensible fact. They were merely postponing\nthe evil day until after your wedding, and when the crash came it\nturned out to be no less than a catastrophe. Stephen Elliott met it\nlike a man, giving up everything to his creditors, and coming down to\na life of the barest necessities with the serenity of a philosopher,\nhappy, apparently, that the well of assets was deep enough to brim the\ntank of liability, though at the expense of the final drop.\n\nI am told that he was left quite without resources other than a small\nsum of money which one of the creditors absolutely refused to accept;\nand he assures me that he will once more shoulder pick and shovel and\ngo afield again as soon as the season is a little farther advanced.\nI confess frankly that the heroism of it bedazes me. If there be any\nfiner example of dauntlessness in the heart of man, the novellers have\nnot yet portrayed it for us. He was sixty-three last January, and\nhe promises to begin the search for another competence with all the\nenthusiasm and ardor of youth!\n\nConstance you know, and I need not assure you that the sudden\ndown-dropping touches her not at all; or if at all, only on the side\nof her beneficences to others. So far as one may perceive, the change\nfor her is only of encompassments. She is as much above it as she was\nsuperior to the cheapening effect of an elastic bank account. To me\nshe seems the sweeter for the chastening, though really, I presume,\nshe is neither better nor worse for it,--nor any different. You may be\nsure that my first call upon them after the submergence was made with a\nheartful of sympathy,--which I took away with me, and with it a lesson\nin sincerity and simple-heartedness rare enough in my experience. There\nis gentle blood and enviable in these two. My pen is too clumsy to ink\nin the details of this picture for you.\n\nAs to Jeffard: When he made his appearance I struck hands with your\npoint of view sufficiently to meet him as if nothing save good fortune\nhad overtaken him,--an attitude which it is sometimes as difficult for\nme to maintain as it appears altogether impossible for some others who\nused to know him. By which you will understand that he is ostracized\nin a way, or would be in any casting of the potsherd votes by the\nunthinking majority.\n\nI am bound to say, however, that the whiplash of public opinion does\nnot seem to be quite long enough to reach him. A fortnight ago, for\nreasons charitable or experimental, as you please, I got him a bidding\nto one of Mrs. Calmaine's \"ridottos.\" You know Mrs. Calmaine and her\ntolerance, and you will appreciate the situation when I tell you that\nI had to manoeuvre a bit for the formal invitation, though Jeffard\nused to be in her good book. Jeffard accepted, and I went with him to\nsee what would befall. There were a good many there who had known the\nprehistoric Jeffard, and while they did not pointedly ignore him, they\nseemed to be divided between a desire to cold-shoulder the man and to\nconciliate the prospective millionaire;--wherefore they compromised by\ngiving him what you would call \"the high hand-shake.\"\n\nWhatever may have been my motive in dragging him into it, Jeffard's own\nreasons for going were confessedly experimental. So much he confided\nto me on our early retreat from the house of mirth. \"I wanted to find\nout where I stand,\" he said, \"and these good people have been quite\nexplicit. Don't get me any more invitations.\" And after a time he\nadded, \"I can buy them when I want them.\" From which you will infer\nthat he will henceforth sit in the seat of the scornful, and this, I\nfear, is the lamentable fact.\n\nTouching his present mode of life, it borders on the puzzling. With\na bank deposit which is currently reported to reach seven figures,\nand which is doubtless well up in the sixes, he lives in two rooms in\na block, and takes his meals at the club. A very rich spendthrift\nmight do this, you will say, saving at the spigot and wasting at the\nbung; but so far as my observation goes, Jeffard seems not to know\nthat his barrel has a bung. And if any of the staves have started on\nthe side of dissipation, the leak is not yet apparent to me. The other\nevening, when I let drive a little arrow pointed with a gibe at his\npenuriousness, he laughed and reminded me of something he had said one\nnight in the famine time when we were dining by the help of a small\nwindfall of mine. \"I told you I should be a miser if the tide ever\nturned,\" said he, \"and you scoffed at me. I assure you I can account\nfor every dollar I have spent since the Midas began to pour them in.\"\n\nThis is his attitude as he defines it, but I can qualify the accusation\na little on the friendly side. I should rather say that he had set his\nmark at thrifty frugality. He is not niggardly; in benevolences which\nmay be paid for in the coin of effort he is still generous; and if he\nwere living on a clerk's income people would commend him.\n\nBut I fancy I hear you cry \"Enough!\" and this ends with the heartiest\ngood wishes for you both.\n\n                                Faithfully yours,\n                                           ROBERT LANSDALE.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\nLANSDALE had defined himself as a reporter on the \"Coloradoan,\" but in\nreality he was rather more,--or less,--being that anomalous member of a\nnewspaper staff known as the literary editor. Kershaw had taken him in\ndoubtfully, and had afterward wondered why a man with such an evident\ngift for journalistic work should prefer to spend his days and nights\nwriting stories which no one would buy. For, contrary to all precedent,\nwhen he could sink his literary ambitions the fictionist proved to be a\ngeneral utility journalist of no uncertain ability, running the office\ngamut from proof-reading in an emergency to filling the editorial\ncolumns on the rare occasions when Kershaw was absent.\n\nIt was during one of the Kershawan absences that the letter to Bartrow\nwas written; and the hands of the paper-weight clock on the desk were\npointing to the supper hour when Lansdale dropped the pen and drew\ndown the desk-curtain. Unlike his chief, he rarely ignored the supper\nrecess, though a walk in the open air often took the place of the meal;\nand having his night's work well in hand, he let himself into the\ncorridor, said \"Down!\" and was presently set afoot at the street level.\n\nAs usual, the swift rush down the elevator-shaft dizzied him, and he\nhad to steady himself before he could go on. When he allowed himself to\nthink about it he realized that these dizzyings were growing commoner,\nand were set awhirl by slighter exciting causes. Another man, or a man\nwith another ailment, might have given the unnerving weakness its true\nname and place and succumbed to it; but Lansdale's _m\u00c3\u00a9tier_ had been\nlove-transformed into unflinching hopefulness, and the trivialities\nof the daily walk had come to be so many blind and desperate sorties\nagainst the indrawing lines of the relentless besieger. For of the two\nlions standing in the way to the House Beautiful that named Inequality\nhad been slain by the collapse of the Lodestar; wherefore this other of\nIll-health must either slay or be slain, since love would not be denied.\n\nThis was what was in his resolute step when he went forth into the\nnight; into the whirl of life on the peopled streets and sidewalks.\nSome vague supper promptings were present, but a stronger impulse sent\nhim riverward, away from the thickly peopled walks and down into the\nwholesale district toward a shabby apartment building which had been\nleft stranded on the bar of traffic when the uptown tide had set in.\n\nThe little excursion was purposeless, as had been many another in the\nsame direction; but when he found himself opposite the stairway of the\nshabby building he wondered if he might not go up and ask Constance\nfor a cup of tea. He was wise in his generation, and he had long\nsince discovered that the way to Constance Elliott's heart lay through\nhelpings accepted. With love abounding for any human soul at need,\nthere were precious reserves of tenderness for those to whom she might\nminister.\n\nLansdale glanced up at the two lighted windows on the third floor and\ncrossed the street. In the stair archway, which was dimly lighted\nby a single inefficient gas-jet, he stumbled upon a bit of by-play,\nin which the actors were a man and a woman leaning together across\nthe stair-rail, and a barelegged boy spying upon the twain from the\ndimnesses beyond. The little tableau fell apart at the sound of the\nintruder's footsteps. The boy vanished mysteriously, the woman ran\nupstairs, and the man turned half angrily, as one faulted. It was\nJeffard; and when he recognized Lansdale he spoke quickly, as if to\nforestall possible comment.\n\n\"Hello!--think of the devil and you'll hear the clatter of his hoofs. I\nwas just about to go up to the print-shop to see if I could find you.\nBeen to supper?\"\n\n\"No; I was\"--\n\nJeffard cut in again swiftly, with edgings streetward. \"That's lucky;\nneither have I. Let's go up to the club.\"\n\nLansdale acceded rather reluctantly, since a cup of tea with Constance\neasily outweighed the grill-room prospect.\n\n\"I'll go with you, though I can't promise to play much of a knife and\nfork,\" he said. \"I was just going up to ask Miss Elliott to give me a\ncup of tea.\"\n\nThey were turning the corner above the stranded apartment house before\nJeffard returned the shuttle of speech.\n\n\"So the Elliotts live down there now, do they?\"\n\nLansdale said \"Yes,\" and began to rummage in recollection. Had Jeffard\nbeen on Constance Elliott's visiting list in the prehistoric time? It\nwas probable that he had been,--with Dick Bartrow for his sponsor. But\nat this point recollection turned up the mental notes of a certain talk\nwith Bartrow, in which the downright one had confessed his sins of\nomission Jeffardward. So Lansdale added a query to the affirmative.\n\n\"Yes; they live in the Thorson Block. Do you know them?\"\n\nJeffard's reply was no reply. \"I'll have to take time to think about\nit,\" he said; and they had traversed the necessary streets and found a\ntable _\u00c3\u00a0 deux_ in the grill-room at the club before he pieced out the\nunfinished rejoinder.\n\n\"You asked me if I knew the Elliotts. I did know Miss Elliott,--as I\nknew some of those people at Mrs. Calmaine's the other evening. It's\nquite likely she does not remember me.\"\n\nLansdale's brain went apart again, and the reflective half of it\ncontinued the rummaging. On the two or three occasions when he had\nmentioned the newest star in the bonanzine firmament Constance had been\nvisibly disturbed. The nature of her resentment had not been quite\nobvious, but Jeffard's tardy rejoinder made it clear. She had known\nJeffard and was sorry to be reminded of him.\n\nLansdale had not done full justice to himself in slurring his own point\nof view in the letter to Bartrow. So far as he had analyzed it he had\nbeen content to call it negative, but it was not quite that. On the\ncontrary, it was complaisant, concerning itself chiefly with the things\nof past sight, and not unduly with those of present rumor. Jeffard\nmight be an indubitable scoundrel in his later reincarnation, as\ncertain of the mining-camp newspapers had intimated in their accounts\nof the fight for possession; but in the older time he had been a good\nfellow and a generous friend at a pinch. Lansdale remembered some of\nthe generosities, and his heart went soft at the recollection of them.\nKershaw had kept the secret of the prearranged purchase of certain\nunusable manuscripts, but the pigeon-holes of a newspaper office are\nopen archives, and one day Lansdale had found a clue which he had\nfollowed out to his comforting; a string of hitherto unexplainable\nincidents, with two stanch friends at the end of it.\n\nOne of these loyal friends was the man at whom public opinion was\nnow pointing a dubious finger; and while Lansdale was munching his\ntoast and drinking his cup of weak tea in troubled silence, it began\nto be discomfortingly evident that he must presently take sides for\nor against the man whose hospitality he was at that moment sharing.\nLeft to itself, the insularity in him would have evaded the issue.\nLoyalty of the crucible-test degree of fineness--the loyalty of the\nsingle eye--must needs sit below the salt at the table of any analyst\nof his kind; and Lansdale was a student first and a partisan only when\nbenefits unforgot constrained him. Moreover, frankness in the last\nresort is rarely at its best in any vivisector of his fellow-men, and\nit was with no little difficulty that Lansdale made shift to overleap\nthe barrier of reserve.\n\n\"Jeffard,\" he began, when the weak tea was low in the cup, \"we used to\nbe pretty near to each other in a time that I like to remember; will\nyou bear with me if I say what is in my mind?\"\n\n\"Surely,\" said Jeffard; but the tone was not of assurance.\n\n\"You know what the newspapers intimated last fall, and what people are\nsaying of you now?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And that your silence makes it rather hard for your friends?\"\n\n\"I have no friends, Lansdale.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you have; or you would have if you would take the trouble to\nset yourself aright.\"\n\n\"What if I cannot set myself aright?\"\n\n\"I should be sorry to believe that,--more than sorry to be driven to\nadmit the alternative.\"\n\n\"What is the alternative?\"\n\nLansdale hesitated, as one who has his point at his adversary's breast\nand is loath to drive it in. \"I don't quite like to put it in words,\nJeffard; the English is a bit harsh. But you will understand that it\nis the smiting of a friend. So long as you refuse to say you didn't,\nthe supposition is that you have robbed a man to whom you were under\nrather heavy obligations.\"\n\n\"Is that Bartrow's supposition?\"\n\n\"He says it isn't, but I'm afraid the wish is the father to the\nthought: in his case as in--as in that of others.\" Lansdale added the\ninclusive in the hope that the wound would be the better for probing.\n\nJeffard's laugh was altogether bitter. \"'Give a dog a bad name,'\" he\nquoted. \"Do you know, I fancied Dick would be obstinate enough to stand\nout against the apparent fact?\"\n\n\"That is precisely what he has done, and with less reason than the most\ndevoted partisan might demand. You know you told him that the claim was\nGarvin's. He wouldn't believe the newspaper story; he insisted that you\nwould be able to 'square' yourself, as he phrased it, when you came\nout.\"\n\nJeffard was looking past his interlocutor, out and beyond to where the\nfarther tables were emptying themselves of the late diners.\n\n\"Yet it is his supposition; and your own, you were going to say. Is it\nMiss Elliott's also?\"\n\nLansdale resisted the impulse to rummage again, and said: \"I don't know\nthat--how should I know? But rumor has made the charge, and you have\nnot denied it.\"\n\n\"I don't mean to deny it--not even to her. But neither have I admitted\nit.\"\n\n\"My dear Jeffard! aren't the facts an admission?--at least, so long as\nthey stand uncontradicted.\"\n\n\"Everybody seems to think so,--and I can afford to be indifferent.\"\n\n\"Having the money, you mean?--possibly. Am I to take that as an\nadmission of the facts?\"\n\n\"Facts are fixtures, aren't they? things not to be set up or set aside\nby admissions or denials. But you may take it as you please.\"\n\nLansdale shook his head as one whose deprecation is too large for\nspeech. \"I can't begin to understand it, Jeffard,--the motive which\ncould impel a man of your convictions, I mean.\"\n\nJeffard broke forth in revilings. \"What do you know about my\nconvictions? What do you know about anything in the heart of man? You\nhave a set of formulas which you call types, and into which you try to\nfit all human beings arbitrarily, each after his kind. It's the merest\nchild's-play; a fallacy based on an assumption. No two men can be\nsquared by the same rule; no two will do the same things under exactly\nsimilar conditions. Character-study is your specialty, I believe;\nbut you have yet to learn that the human atom is an irresponsible\nindividuality.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, I haven't; I grant you that. But logically\"--\n\n\"Logic has nothing whatever to do with it. It's ego, pure and\nunstrained, in most of us; a sluggish river of self, with a quicksand\nof evil for its bottom.\"\n\nLansdale borrowed a gun of his antagonist, and sighted it accurately.\n\n\"What do you know about humanity as a whole? What do you know about any\npart of it save your own infinitesimal fraction?--which seems to be a\nrather unfair sample.\"\n\nJeffard confessed judgment and paid the costs. \"I don't know very much\nabout the sample, Lansdale. One time--it was in the sophomore year, I\nbelieve--I thought I knew my own potentialities. But I didn't. If any\none had prophesied then that I had it in me to do what I have done, I\nshould have demanded a miracle to confirm it.\"\n\n\"But you must justify yourself to yourself,\" Lansdale persisted.\n\n\"Why must I? That is another of your cut-and-dried formulas. So\nfar from recognizing any such obligation, I may say that I gave up\ntrying to account for myself a long time ago. And if I have found it\nimpossible, it isn't worth while for you to try.\"\n\nLansdale was not the man to bruise his hands with much beating upon\nthe barred doors of any one's confidence. So he said, \"I'm done. It's\nbetween you and your conscience,--if you haven't eliminated that with\nthe other things. But I had hoped you'd see fit to defend yourself.\nThe eternal query is sharp enough without the pointing of particular\ninstances.\"\n\nJeffard squared himself, with his elbows on the table.\n\n\"Do you want an hypothesis, too?--as another man did? Take this, and\nmake the most of it. You knew me and my lacks and havings. You knew\nthat I had reached a point at which I would have pawned my soul for\nthe wherewithal to purchase a short hour or two of forgetfulness. Hold\nthat picture in your mind, and conceive that a summer of unsuccessful\nprospecting had not changed me for better or worse. Is the point of\nview unobstructed?\"\n\n\"The point of view is your own, not mine,\" Lansdale objected. \"And,\nmoreover, the summer did change you, because advancement in some\ndirection is an irrefrangible law. But go on.\"\n\n\"I will. This man whom you have in mind was suddenly brought face to\nface with a great temptation,--great and subtle. Garvin drove the\ntunnel on the Midas three years ago and abandoned it as worthless. It\nwas my curiosity which led to the discovery of the gold. It was I who\ntook the sample to the assayer and carried the news of the bonanza to\nGarvin. I might have kept the knowledge to myself, but I didn't. Why?\ndo you ask? I don't know--perhaps because it didn't occur to me. What\nfollowed Bartrow has told you, but not all. Let us assume that the race\nto Aspen was made in good faith; that this man who had put honor and\ngood report behind him really meant to stand between a drunken fool and\nthe fate he was rushing upon. Can you go so far with me?\"\n\nLansdale nodded. He was spellbound, but it was the artist in him and\nnot the man who hung breathless upon the edge of expectancy.\n\n\"Very well; now for the crux. This man knelt behind a locked door and\nheard himself execrated by the man he was trying to save; heard the\nfirst kindly impulse he had yielded to in months distorted into a\ndesperate plan to rob the cursing maniac. Is it past belief that he\ncrept away from the locked door and sat down to ask himself in hot\nresentment why he should go on? Is it not conceivable that he should\nhave begun to give ear to the plea of self-preservation?--to say to\nhimself that if the maniac were no better than a lost man it was no\nreason that the treasure should be lost also?\"\n\nIt was altogether conceivable, and Lansdale nodded again. Jeffard found\na cigar and went on while he was clipping the end of it.\n\n\"But that was not all. Picture this man at the crumbling point of\nresolution tiptoeing to the door to listen again. He has heard enough\nto convince him that the miracle of fortune will be worse than wasted\nupon the drunken witling. Now he is to hear that the besotted fool\nhas already transferred whatever right he had in the Midas to the two\ndespoilers; signed a quitclaim, sold his miracle for a drink or two of\nwhiskey, more or less. Are you listening?\"\n\nLansdale moistened his lips with the lees of the tea in the empty cup,\nand said, \"Yes; go on.\"\n\nJeffard sat back and lighted the cigar. \"That's all,\" he said curtly.\n\"It's enough, isn't it? You knew the man a year ago; you think you\nknow him now. What would he do?\"\n\nIf the hypothesis were intended to be a test of blind loyalty it missed\nthe mark by just so much as the student of his kind must hold himself\naloof from sympathetic entanglements. Lansdale weighed the evidence,\nnot as a partisan, but rather as an onlooker whose point of view was\nwholly extrinsic.\n\n\"I understand,\" said he; \"the man would do as you have done. It's your\nown affair. As I said a few minutes ago, it is between you and your\nprivate conscience. And I dare say if the facts were known the public\nconscience wouldn't condemn you. Don't you want to use the columns of\nthe 'Coloradoan'?\"\n\nJeffard's negative was explosive. \"Do you write me down a fool as well\nas a knave? Damn the public conscience!\"\n\n\"Don't swear; I was only offering to turn the stone for you if you've\nanything to grind.\"\n\n\"I haven't. If I wanted the consent of the majority I could buy\nit,--buy it if I had shot the maniac instead of letting him shoot me.\"\n\n\"Possibly; and yet you couldn't buy any fraction of it that is worth\nhaving,\" Lansdale asserted, with conviction. \"There are a few people\nleft who have not bowed the head in the house of Rimmon.\"\n\nThe cynical hardness went out of Jeffard's eye and lip, and for the\nfirst time since the proletary's reincarnation, Lansdale fancied he got\na brief glimpse of the man he had known in the day of sincerity.\n\n\"A few, yes; the Elliotts, father and daughter, for two, you would\nsay. I wonder if you could help me there.\"\n\n\"To their good opinion?--my dear Jeffard, I'm no professional\nconscience-keeper!\"\n\n\"No, I didn't mean that. What I had in mind is a much simpler thing.\nA year ago Miss Elliott gave me of her abundance. She meant it as a\ngift, though I made it a loan and repaid the principal--when I was able\nto. But I am still in her debt. Measured by consequences, which are\nthe only true interest-table, the earnings of her small investment are\nhardly to be computed in dollars and cents. Naturally, she won't take\nthat view of it, but that does not cancel my obligation. Will you help\nme to discharge it? They need money.\"\n\nLansdale let the appeal simmer in the pot of reflection. His\ninclination was to refuse to be drawn into any such entanglement; but\nthe opportunity to lessen by ever so little the burdens of the woman he\nloved was not to be lightly set aside. None the less, the thing seemed\nimpossible.\n\n\"I'm afraid it's too big for me, Jeffard; I shouldn't know how to go\nabout it. Don't misunderstand me. I shouldn't stick at the necessary\nequivocations; but if you know Miss Elliott you must know that\nMachiavelli himself couldn't be insincere with her. She would have to\nbe told the truth, and\"--\n\nHe left the sentence incomplete, and Jeffard took it up at the break.\n\n\"And if she should acknowledge my obligation--which she would not--she\nwould refuse to be reimbursed out of Garvin's money. That is why I\nhaven't sent her a note with a check in it. Will you have another cup\nof tea?\"\n\nLansdale took the query as a dismissal of the subject and pushed back\nhis chair. On the way out they passed a late incomer; a florid man,\nwith a nervous step and the eye of preoccupation. He nodded to Lansdale\nin passing, and Jeffard said, \"Do you know him?\"\n\n\"Yes; it's Finchly,--John Murray's man of business.\"\n\nJeffard had apparently relapsed into the deeper depths of cynicism\nagain.\n\n\"Yes, I know. That's the charitable euphemism. Murray is a day laborer,\ntransmogrified by a lucky strike into a millionaire. He doesn't know\nenough to write his own name, much less how to keep a great fortune\nfrom dissolving, so he hires a manager. It was a happy thought. What\ndoes Finchly get?\"\n\nLansdale laughed. \"A good living, doubtless.\"\n\n\"Of course; and much more, with the pickings. But there is a salary\nwhich is supposed to be the consideration, isn't there?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; and the figure of it varies with the imagination of the\ngossips from ten to fifty thousand a year.\"\n\nJeffard stopped to relight his cigar, and Lansdale fancied that the\nFinchly query went out with the spent match. But Jeffard revived it a\nsquare farther on.\n\n\"Suppose we assume, for the sake of argument, that the man has a\nconscience. How much could he justly take for the service rendered?\"\n\nThey were at the entrance of the \"Coloradoan\" building, and Lansdale\ntook out his notebook and made a memorandum.\n\n\"That is good for a column,\" he said; \"'The Moral Responsibility of\nMillionaire-Managers.' I'll answer your question later, when I've had\ntime to think it over.\"\n\n\"But, seriously,\" Jeffard insisted. \"Is it worth ten thousand a\nyear?--or the half of it? The man is only a cashier,--a high-class\naccountant at best.\"\n\n\"Finchly is much more than that; he is Murray's brain as well as his\npen-hand. But if he were only a money-counter, a money-counter's salary\nwould be enough; say two or three thousand a year, to be liberal.\"\n\nJeffard nodded and was turning away; had in fact taken three steps\nstreetward, when he came back to return to the subject dropped at the\nsupper table as though there had been no hiatus.\n\n\"You were going to say she would refuse to take Garvin's money, and\nI said it for you. Would it make it any easier if I can assure you\nthat the money I shall put in your hands is honestly mine?--that James\nGarvin has no claim, ethical or otherwise, upon it? Take time to\nconsider it,--with an eye to Miss Elliott's present needs rather than\nto my havings or wishes in the matter.\"\n\nLansdale was off his guard, and the human side of him came uppermost\nin the swift rejoinder,--\"Then you didn't tell me the whole truth? The\nMidas is honestly yours, after all?\"\n\nJeffard turned away and snapped the ash from his cigar. \"Don't jump\nat conclusions,\" he said. \"It's always safer to go on voting with the\nmajority. What I said has nothing to do with the story of the man and\nhis temptation; but the meanest laborer is worthy of his hire. I worked\nall winter with pick and shovel in the Midas. Good-night.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\nIT was early in June when the pneumatic drill in the Little Myriad\nwas smashed by a premature blast, and the master of the mine was\nconstrained to make a flying trip to Denver to replace it. As a matter\nof course, if not, indeed, of necessity, Myra went with him. They\ntraveled by the night train, breakfasted on canned viands out of the\nPullman buffet, and so took Constance by surprise.\n\nMyra had projects in view, some Utopian and others more Utopian, with\nher relatives for nuclei; and when Richard the untactful had been sent\nabout his machinery business, she settled down for a persuasive day\nwith Constance. Now Constance had been taken unawares, but she was of\nthose who fight best at a disadvantage, and the end of the day found\nthe Utopian projects still in air, being held in suspension by an\nobstinate young person who steadily refused to make of herself a vessel\nmeet for condolence and cousinly beneficence.\n\n\"It's no use, cuzzy dear; you shall have an option on the help stock\nwhen there is any for sale, but at present there are no quotations.\"\n\nThus Connie, at the very end of the persuasive day. Upon which the\nyoung wife, with patience outwearing or outworn, retorts smartly:--\n\n\"I suppose you think it's heroic--your living like this; but it isn't.\nIt is just plain poverty pride, which is all well enough to keep the\ncrowd out, but which is simply wicked when it makes you shut the door\nin our faces. Think of it--you living here in three rooms at the top\nof a block when the Myriad has begun to pay dividends! I didn't mean\nto tell you just yet, but Dick is going to buy back the Colfax Avenue\nhouse, and it shall stand empty till doomsday if you won't go and live\nin it.\"\n\nIn times not long past Connie would have returned railing for\nrailing--with interest added; but the reproachful day had been no\nless trying to her than to Myra, and the poverty fight--and some\nothers--were sore upon her. Hence her disclaimer was of courageous\nmeekness, with a smile of loving appreciation to pave the way.\n\n\"I hope Dick will do no such preposterous thing--unless you want it for\nyourselves. You know it would be quite out of the question for us to\ntake it. Or to do anything but make the best of what has happened,\" she\nadded.\n\nMyra was standing at a window, looking down into the street where the\nearly dusk was beginning to prick out the point-like coruscations of\nthe arc-lights. There was that in Connie's eyes which beckoned tears to\neyes sympathetic; and she found it easier to go on with her back turned\nupon the room and its other occupant.\n\n\"To make the best of it, yes; but you are not making the best of it.\nOr, if you are, the best is miserably bad. You are looking thin and\nwretched, as if--as if you didn't get enough to eat.\"\n\nThere was a touch of the old-time resilience in Connie's laugh. \"How\ncan you tell when you're not looking at me? Indeed, it hasn't come to\nthat yet. We have enough, and a little to spare for those who have\nless.\"\n\nMyra had been searching earnestly all day for some little rift into\nwhich the wedge of helpfulness might be driven, and here was an\nopening--of the vicarious sort.\n\n\"Won't you let me be your purseholder for those who have less, Connie?\nThat is the very least you can do.\"\n\nConstance willed it thankfully. After the trying day of refusals it was\ngrateful to find something that could be conceded.\n\n\"I believe I told you once that I wouldn't be your proxy in that way,\ndidn't I? But I will, now. You are so much better than your theories,\nMyra.\"\n\nMyra left the window at that, wrote a generous check before the\nconcession should have time to shrink in the cooling, and then went\nover to sit on the denim-covered lounge with her arm around her\ncousin's waist.\n\n\"Now that you have begun to be reasonable, won't you go a step farther,\nConnie, dear? I know there are troubles,--lots of them besides the\npinching. Can't you lean on me just a little bit? I do so want to help\nyou.\"\n\nConnie did it literally, with her face on Myra's shoulder and a\nsob at the catching of her breath. Myra let her take her own time,\nas a judicious comforter will, and when the words came they wrought\nthemselves into a confession.\n\n\"Oh, Myra, I thought I was so strong, and I'm not!\" she wept. \"The\nbullet in a gun hasn't less to say about where it shall be sent. I said\nit wasn't the pinch, but it is--or part of it is. Poppa has set his\nheart upon trying the mountains again, old as he is, and he can't go\nbecause--because there isn't money enough to outfit him with what he\ncould carry on his back!\"\n\n\"And you would have let me go without telling me!\" said Myra\nreproachfully. \"He shall have a whole pack train of 'grub stake,'--is\nthat what I should say?--and you shall come and stay with us while he\nis away. Consider that a trouble past, and tell me some more. You don't\nknow how delicious it is to be permitted to pose as a small god in a\ncar.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" Connie responded, out of a heartful of similar ecstasies.\n\"But it isn't a trouble past: he won't let you do it. Everybody has\nbeen offering to lend him money, and he won't take it.\"\n\n\"He will have to take it from me,\" said Myra, with prompt decision.\n\"I'll make him. And when he goes, you will come to us, won't you?\"\n\nConstance looked up with a smile shining through the tears. \"You're\ngood, Myra, just like Dick! But I can't, you know. I must stay here.\"\n\n\"Why must you?\" To the querist there seemed to be sufficiently good\nreasons, from the point of view of the proprieties, for setting\nConnie's decision aside mandatorily, but Myra had grown warier if not\nwiser in her year of cousin-kenning.\n\n\"There are reasons,--duties which I must not shirk.\"\n\n\"Are they namable?\"\n\n\"Yes; Margaret is the name of one of them.\"\n\nMyra's disapproval found vent in gentle foot-tappings. To the\nmoderately compassionate on-looker it would seem that Constance had\nlong since filled that measure of responsibility,--filled and heaped it\nto overflowing. But again the experienced one was discreet.\n\n\"As Dick would put it, you have 'angeled' Margaret for a year and more.\nIsn't she yet able to stand alone?\"\n\nConnie's answer was prompt and decisive. \"Quite as well able as the\nbest of us would be under similar conditions.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't make it conditional; but we've never been able to keep step\nin that journey. Why is Margaret's case exceptional?\"\n\n\"Did I say it was? It isn't. She is just one of any number of poor\ngirls who are trying to live honestly, with the barriers of innocence\nall down and an overwhelming temptation always beckoning.\"\n\nMyra shook her head. \"That is making temptation a constraint, when it\ncan never be more than a lure. I must confess I can't get far enough\naway from the conventional point of view to understand how a young\nwoman like Margaret, who has been lifted and carried and set fairly\nupon her feet, could be tempted to go back to the utter misery and\ndegradation of the other life.\"\n\nConstance spoke first to the sophism, and then to the particular\ninstance.\n\n\"It is not true that temptation is always a lure. It is oftener a\nconstraint. And you say you can't understand. It is terribly simple.\nThey sin first for a thing which they mistake for love; but after that\nit is for bread and meat, and surcease from toil which has become a\nmere frenzied struggle to keep body and soul together. You don't know\nwhat it is to be poor, Myra,--with the barriers down. Have you any idea\nhow much Margaret earned last week, working steadily the six days and\ndeep into the nights?\"\n\n\"Oh, not very much, I suppose. But her necessities are not large.\"\n\n\"Are they not? They are as large as yours or mine. She must eat and\ndrink and have a bed to sleep on and clothes to cover her. And to\nprovide these she was paid three dollars and eighty-five cents for\nher week's work; and two dollars of that had to go for rent. Is the\ntemptation a lure or a constraint in her case?\"\n\nMyra was silenced, if not convinced, and she went back to the fact\nexistent with sympathy no more than seemingly aloof.\n\n\"You hinted at Margaret's peculiar besetment in one of your letters. Is\nthat what you have to stay and fight?\"\n\nConstance nodded assent.\n\n\"I have been hoping you were mistaken. Dick is still loyally\nincredulous. Isn't there a chance that you or Tommie, or both of you,\nhave taken too much for granted?\"\n\nConnie's \"No\" was almost inaudible, and there was chastened sorrow in\nher voice when she went on to tell how Tommie had seen Jeffard and\nMargaret together, not once, but many times; how the man was always\npersuading, and the woman, reluctant at first, was visibly yielding;\nhow within a week Tommie had seen Jeffard give her money.\n\n\"And she took it?\" Myra queried.\n\n\"She didn't want to take it. Tommie says she almost fought with him to\nmake him take it back. But he wouldn't.\"\n\nMyra's sympathy circled down, but it alighted upon Connie. \"You poor\ndear! after all your loving-kindnesses and helpings! It's miserable;\nbut you can't do anything if you stay.\"\n\n\"Yes, I can. I couldn't stay alone, of course, and she will give up her\nroom and come here to live with me. That will give me a better hold on\nher than I have now.\"\n\n\"But if you had a hundred eyes you couldn't safeguard her against her\nwill!\"\n\n\"No; but it isn't her will,--it's his. And he will not come here.\"\n\nMyra's brows went together in a little frown of righteous indignation.\n\"I should hope not,--the wretch! You were right, after all, Connie, and\nI'll retract all the charitable things Dick wanted me to say. He is\ntoo despicable\"--\n\nIt was Connie's hand on the accusing lips that cut short the indignant\narraignment.\n\n\"Please don't!\" she pleaded. \"He is all that you can say or think, but\nmy ears are weary with my own repetitions of it.\"\n\nMyra took the hand from her lips and held it fast while she tried to\nsearch her cousin's face. But the gathering dusk had mounted from the\nlevel of the street to that of the upper room, and it baffled the\neye-questioning.\n\n\"Connie Elliott! I more than half believe\"--She stopped abruptly, as if\nthere had been some dumb protest of the imprisoned hand, and then went\non with a swift change from accusation to gentle reproach. \"I believe\nyou have only just begun to tell me your troubles,--and I've been with\nyou all day! What are some more of them?\"\n\n\"I have told you the worst of them,--or at least that part of them\nwhich makes it impossible for me to go away. But there is another\nreason why I ought to stay.\"\n\n\"Is that one namable, too?\"\n\n\"Yes; but perhaps you won't understand. And you will be sure to tell\nme it isn't proper. I think one of Mr. Lansdale's few pleasures is his\ncoming here.\"\n\n\"Few remaining pleasures, you would say, if you were not too\ntender-hearted. Is it wise, Connie?\"\n\n\"Why not?--if it is a comfort to him?\"\n\nMyra hesitated, not because she had nothing to say, but because she\nknew not how to say the thing demanded.\n\n\"You haven't given me leave to be quite frank with you, Connie. But it\nseems to me that your kindness in this case is--is mistaken kindness.\"\n\nConstance's rejoinder was merely an underthought slipping the leash.\n\"It is not to be expected that any one would understand,\" she said.\n\n\"But I do understand,\" Myra asserted, this time with better\nconfidence. \"I'm not supposed to have the slightest inkling of your\nfeelings,--you've never lisped a word to me,--but Mr. Lansdale's\nmotives are plain enough to be read in the dark. If he were a well man\nhe would have asked you to marry him long ago.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" said Constance half absently. \"I'm not so sure about\nthat. He is far away from home and wretchedly ill; and he has many\nacquaintances and few real friends.\"\n\n\"But he loves you,\" Myra persisted.\n\n\"He has never said anything like that to me.\"\n\n\"It is quite possible that he never will, in view of the insurmountable\nobstacle.\"\n\n\"His ill-health, you mean? Myra, dear, you surely know love better than\nthat--now. Love is the one thing which will both sow and reap even in\nthe day when the heavens are of brass and the earth is a barren desert.\"\n\nThe under-roar of traffic in the street made the silence in the upper\nroom more effective by contrast; like the sense of isolation which\nis often sharpest in a jostling throng. Myra rose and went to the\nwindow again, coming back presently to stand over Constance and say,\n\"I suppose it is ordained that you should be a martyr to somebody or\nsomething, Connie, dear; and when the time comes I'm not going to say\nyou nay, because I think you will be happier that way. If Mr. Lansdale\nshould be tempted to say that which I am sure he has determined not to\nsay, is your answer ready?\"\n\nConnie's hands were clasped over one knee, and the poise was of\nintrospective beatitude. But the answer to Myra's query was not\nirrelevant.\n\n\"He is the truest of gentlemen; what would your answer be, Myra?\"\n\nIt was the young wife in Myra Bartrow, that precious bit of clay as\nyet plastic under the hand of the master-potter, that prompted the\nsteadfast reply.\n\n\"If I loved him as I ought, I should pray God to make me unselfish\nenough to say yes, Connie.\"\n\n\"So should I,\" said Constance simply; and Myra made the lighting of\nthe lamp an excuse for the diversion which the three soft-spoken words\ndemanded. And when she went back to the matter of fact, she touched\nlightly upon what she conceived to be a wound yet far from healing.\n\n\"You have silenced me, Connie, but I can at least provide for the\ncontingency. If the event shapes itself so that you are free to come to\nus, don't let Margaret stand in the way. Bring her with you, and we'll\nfind room and work for her.\"\n\nConnie's eyes were shining, but there was a loving smile struggling\nwith the tears. \"I said you were good, like Dick, Myra, dear, and I\ncan't put it any stronger. If I don't take you at your word, it will\nnot be for anything you have left unsaid. Isn't that Dick coming?\"\n\nIt was. There was a double step in the corridor, and Bartrow came in\nwith Stephen Elliott. Since the battle persuasive with the daughter had\nkept her single-eyed, Myra had had but brief glimpses of the father\nduring the day; but now she remarked that his step was a little less\nfirmly planted than it had been in that holiday time when he had played\nthe unwonted part of escort in ordinary to two young women who had\ndragged him whither they would,--and whither he would not. Moreover,\nthere was the look of the burden-bearer in his eyes, though their\nfire was undimmed; and an air of belated sprightliness in his manner\nwhich went near to Myra's heart, because she knew it came of conscious\neffort. These jottings and others, the added stoop of the shoulders,\nand the lagging half-step to the rear in entering, as of one who may no\nlonger keep pace with younger men, Myra made while Dick was timing the\ndash for their train.\n\n\"Thirty-five minutes more, and we'll quit you,--say, Uncle Steve, that\nclock of yours is slow,--that's half an hour for supper, and five\nminutes for the yum-yums at the car-step. Gear yourselves, you two, and\nwe'll all go and make a raid on the supper-room at the station.\"\n\n\"Indeed, we sha'n't,\" said Connie, in hospitable protest. \"You are\ngoing to eat bread and butter and drink strong tea on the top floor\nof the Thorson Block. I've had the water cooking for an hour, and you\nsha'n't make me waste gasoline in any such way.\"\n\nDick would have argued the point with her; was, in fact, beginning the\ncounter-protest, when Myra stopped him.'\n\n\"Of course we'll stay,\" she assented. \"You go with Connie and help make\nthe tea, Dick. I haven't begun to have a visit with Uncle Stephen yet.\"\n\nBartrow gave up the fight and was led captive of the small one to the\nroom across the corridor which served as a kitchen. Left alone with\nhis sister's daughter, Stephen Elliott had a sudden return of the\nhaltingnesses which the Philadelphia niece, newly arrived, used to\ninspire; but Myra asked only for an acquiescent listener.\n\n\"Uncle Stephen,\" she began, pinning him in the lounge-corner from which\nthere was no possibility of escape, \"I've been wanting to get at you\nall day, and I was afraid you weren't going to give me a chance. You\nhave 'grub-staked' a lot of people, first and last, haven't you?\"\n\nThe old man eyed her suspiciously for a moment, and then evidently\nbanished the suspicion as a thing unworthy.\n\n\"Why, yes; I have staked a good few of them, first and last, as you\nsay.\"\n\n\"I knew it, and I wanted to ask a question. How much money did you\nusually give them?\"\n\nThe suspicion was well lulled by this; and finding himself upon\nfamiliar ground, the pioneer went into details.\n\n\"That depended a good deal upon the other fellow. Some of them--most of\n'em, I was going to say--couldn't be trusted with money at all, and I'd\ngo buy them an outfit and stay with them till they got out o' range of\nthe saloons and green tables.\"\n\n\"But when you found one whom you could trust, how much money did\nyou give him? I'm not idly curious; I know a man who wants to go\nprospecting, and I have promised to 'stake' him.\"\n\nThe suspicion raised its head again, and was promptly clubbed into\nsubmission. Some one of the Myriad men wanted to try his luck, and he\nhad \"braced\" the wife rather than the husband. So thought the pioneer,\nand made answer accordingly.\n\n\"I wouldn't monkey with it, if I were you, Myra; leastwise, not without\nletting Dick into it. He's right on the ground, and he'll tell you how\nmuch you'd ought to put up; or--what's more likely--if you oughtn't to\ntell the fellow to stick to his day-pay in the mine.\"\n\n\"Dick knows,\" said Myra, anticipating the exact truth by some brief\nhour or so, \"and he's quite willing. But you know Dick; if I should\nleave it with him he would give the man all he had and go and borrow\nfor himself. I want a good sober conservative opinion,--not too\nconservative, you know, but just about what you would need if you were\ngoing out yourself.\"\n\nElliott became dubitantly reflective, being divided between a desire to\nspare Myra's purse and a disposition born of fellow-feelings to make it\nas easy as might be for the unknown beneficiary.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" he said, at length. \"If the fellow is going by\nhimself, he won't need much; but if he takes a partner it'll just about\ndouble the stake. Is he going to play it alone?\"\n\nMyra could see through the open door into the adjoining room, and she\nsaw Connie bringing in the tea. Time was growing precious, if the\nconclusion were not to be tripped up by an interruption.\n\n\"I suppose he'll take a partner; they always do, don't they? Anyway, I\nwant to make it enough so that he can if he chooses. Please tell me how\nmuch.\"\n\n\"Well, if he knows how to cut the corners and how to outfit so as\nto make the most of what he has, he'd ought to be able to do it on\na couple of hundred or so. But I don't know if that ain't pretty\nliberal,\" he added, as if upon second thought.\n\nMyra went quickly to the table under the lamp, and wrote upon a slip of\npaper. Elliott thought she was making a note of her information; and\nwhen she put the check into his hands he took it mechanically. But her\nhurried explanation drove the firing-pin of intelligence.\n\n\"It's for you--you are the man, Uncle Stephen; and if it isn't enough,\nit's your own fault.\" She said it with one eye on the two in the next\nroom, and with nerves taut-braced for the shock of refusal. The shock\ncame promptly.\n\n\"Oh--say--here! Myra, girl; I can't take this from you!\" He was on his\nfeet, trying to give back the check; and as she eluded him he followed\nher about the room, protesting as he went. \"It's just like you to offer\nit, but I can't, don't you see? I'll rope somebody else in; somebody\nthat knows the chances. Here, take it back,--I'm getting pretty old,\nand just as like as not I won't find anything worth assaying. Come,\nnow; you be a good girl, and\"--\n\nHe had driven her into a corner, and it was time for the _coup de\nmain_. So she put her arms about his neck and her face on his shoulder,\nand if the attack pathetic were no more than a clever bit of feigning,\nStephen Elliott was none the wiser.\n\n\"I--I'd like to know what I have done!\" she quavered. \"You'd take it\nfrom a stranger--you said you would--and you've made me just the same\nas your own daughter, and now you wo--won't let me do the first little\nthing I've ever had a chance to do!\"\n\nThere were more strong solvents of a similar nature in reserve, but\nthey were not needed. The good old man was helplessly soluble in any\nwoman's tears, real or invented; and his fine resolution melted and the\nbones of it became as water.\n\n\"There, there, little girl, don't you take on like that. I'll keep it.\nSee? I've chucked it right down into the bottom of my pocket\"--he was\nstroking her hair and otherwise gentling her as if she were a hurt\nchild. \"Don't you fret a little bit. I'll spend it--every last cent of\nit--just the way you want me to. You mustn't cry another tear; Dick'll\nthink I've been abusing you, and he'll fire the old uncle out of one of\nthese high windows. Haven't you got any handkerchief?\"\n\nConnie and Dick were at the door, announcing the bread and butter and\ntea, and Myra's handkerchief became a convenient mask for the moment.\nA less simple-hearted man than the old pioneer might have suspected\nthe sincerity of such tears as may be wiped away at a word, leaving\nno trace behind them; but Elliott was too child-like to know aught of\nthe fine art of dissimulation, and he took Myra's sudden return to\ncheerfulness as a tribute to his own astuteness in yielding a point at\nthe critical moment.\n\nAt the tea-table they were all more or less hilarious, each having\nsomewhat to conceal from the others; and even Bartrow was made to feel\nthe thinness of the ice upon which the trivialities were skating. Much\nto Connie's surprise, the tactless one developed unsuspected resources\nof adroitness in keeping the table-talk at concert-pitch of levity;\nand she forgave him when he was brutal enough to make a jest of the\nsimple meal, giving the bread and butter a new name with each asking,\nand accusing her of being in league with the commissary department\nof the sleeping-car company. It spoke volumes for Dick's growth in\nperspicacity that he was able to discern the keen edge of the crisis\nwithout having actually seen the stone upon which it had been whetted;\nand in the midst of her own fencings with the tensities, Constance\nfound time to wonder how Myra had wrought even the beginning of such a\nmiracle in the downright one.\n\nIn such resolute ignorings of the moving realities the supper interval\nwas safely outworn; but when, at the end of it, Dick dragged out his\nwatch and called \"time,\" Constance found her tea too hot, and the\ndrinking of it brought tears to her eyes. Whereupon the brutal one made\nan exaggerated pretense of sympathy, offering her a handkerchief; and\nthe laugh saved them all until the good-bys were said, and the guests,\nwith Elliott to speed their parting, had gone to the station.\n\nConstance stood in the empty corridor until the farther stair ceased\nto echo their footsteps. The day-long strain was off at last, and she\nmeant to go quickly and clear off the table and wash the supper dishes,\nto the end that the reaction might not overwhelm her. But on the way\nshe stopped at the little square table in the larger room and took a\nletter from its hiding place at the back of a framed photograph. It\nwas a double inclosure in an outside envelope which bore the business\ncard of a well known legal firm; and the wrapping of the inner envelope\nwas a note on the firm's letter-head, stating in terse phrase that the\ninclosed letter had been found under the door of an unoccupied house\nin Colfax Avenue by the writer in the early summer of the previous\nyear; that it had been mislaid; and that it was now forwarded with many\nregrets for its unintentional suppression.\n\nConstance read the note mechanically, as she had read it the day before\nwhen the postman had brought it. It explained nothing more than the\nmere fact of delay, but she understood. The writer of the lost letter,\nor his messenger, had thrust it under the door of the wrong house.\n\nShe laid the note aside and tilted the envelope to let a coin fall into\nher palm. It was a double-eagle piece, little worn, but the memories\nwhich clustered about its giving and taking seemed to dull the lustre\nof the yellow metal. It was the price of sorrowful humiliation, no whit\nless to the man who had taken than to the woman who had given it. She\nput it that way in an inflexible determination to be just. Truly, his\nacceptance of it was a thing to be remembered with cheek-burnings of\nshame; but she would not hold herself blameless. In the light of that\nwhich his letter disclosed, her charitable impulse became a sword to\nslay the last remnant of manly pride and self-respect--if any remnant\nthere were.\n\nShe opened the letter and re-read it to the end, going back from the\nscarcely legible signature to a paragraph in the midst of it that bade\nfair to grave itself ineffaceably upon her heart.\n\n\"You may remember that I said I couldn't tell you the truth, because\nit concerns a woman. When I add that the woman is yourself, you will\nunderstand. I love you; I think I have been loving you ever since that\nevening which you said we were to forget--the evening at the theatre.\nStrangely enough, my love for you isn't strong in the strength which\nsaves. I went from you that night when you had bidden me God-speed\nat Mrs. Calmaine's, and within the hour I was once more a penniless\nvagabond.\n\n\"When you were trying to help me this afternoon, I was trying to keep\nfrom saying that which I could never have a right to say. You pressed\nme very hard in your sweet innocence\"....\n\nShe sat down and the letter slipped from her fingers. The hurt was a\nyear in the past, but time had not yet dulled the pain of it. Not to\nany human soul, nor yet to her own heart, had she admitted the one\nliving fact which stood unshaken; which would stand, like some polished\ncorner-stone of a ruined temple, when all else should have crumbled\ninto dust. For which cause she sat with clasped hands and eyes that saw\nnot; eyes that were still deep wells and clear, but brimming with the\nbitter waters of a fountain which flows only for those whose loss is\nirreparable. And while she wept, the sorrowful under-thought slipped\ninto speech.\n\n\"He calls it love, but it couldn't have been that. He says it wasn't\nstrong in the strength that saves; and love is always mighty to succor\nthe weak-hearted. I would have believed in him--I did believe in him,\nonly I didn't know how to help. But no one could help when he didn't\nbelieve in himself; and now he is just drifting, with the cruel\nsword of opportunity loose in its scabbard, and all the unspeakable\nthings dragging him whithersoever they will.... And he meant to end\nit all when he wrote this letter; I know he did. That would have been\nterrible; but it would have been braver than to go on to robbery, and\nunfaith, and--and now to this last pitiless iniquity. Oh, I can't let\nit go on to that!--not if I have to go and plead with him for the\nsake of that which he once thought was--love.\" She went down upon her\nknees with her face hidden in the chair-cushion, and the unconscious\nmonologue became a passionate beseeching: \"O God, help me to be strong\nand steadfast, that I may not fail when I come to stand between these\ntwo; for Thou knowest the secrets of the heart and all its weakness;\nand Thou knowest\"--\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n\nTHE Bartrows, with Stephen Elliott to expedite their outsetting,\ncaught their train with nothing to spare; and while the goggle-eyed\nswitch-lamps were still flashing past the windows of the sleeping-car,\nMyra settled herself comfortably in her corner of the section and\ndemanded the day's accounting.\n\nBartrow was rummaging in the hand-bag for his traveling-cap, and he\nlooked up with a most transparent affectation of surprise.\n\n\"Hah? Wasn't I supposed to be chasing around all day trying to buy a\nrock-drill?\"\n\nMyra ignored the skilless parry and thrust home. \"Don't tease,\" she\nsaid. \"You did beautifully at the supper-table, and I am quite sure\nConnie didn't suspect. But I want to know what has happened.\"\n\nBartrow laughed good-naturedly. \"Same old window-pane for you to look\nthrough, am I not? It's lucky for me that I'm a rattling good fellow,\nwith nothing particular inside of me to be ashamed of.\" He was thumbing\na collection of pocket-worn papers, and presently handed her a crisp\nbill of exchange for five hundred and forty-five dollars. \"What do you\nthink of that for one of the happenings!\"\n\nShe read the figure of it and the date. \"I don't understand,\" she said.\n\"Where did you get it?\"\n\n\"You wouldn't guess in a thousand years. It's the money I borrowed for\nJeffard one fine morning last fall, with bank interest to date.\"\n\n\"Then you have seen him?\"\n\n\"Saw him, felt of his hand, and went to luncheon with him.\"\n\n\"Dick! And you really had the courage to ask him for this?\"\n\nBartrow's smile was a grimace. \"Don't you sit there and tempt me to\nlie about it. You know what a fool I am with a debtor. Fortunately,\nI didn't have to ask; it came about as most things do in this\nworld--click! buzz! boom! and your infernal machine has exploded. We\ncannoned against each other as I was going into the bank to get the\nmoney for the machinery man. After we'd said 'Hello,' and shook hands,\nJeffard went in with me. On the way out the cashier stopped us. 'Mr.\nJeffard,' says he, 'your personal account has a credit of five hundred\ndollars which doesn't appear in the deposits. If you'll let me have\nyour book I'll enter it.' 'A credit?--of five hundred dollars? I don't\nunderstand,' says Jeffard. 'It's all right,' says the cashier. 'It came\nfrom the Carbonate City National, in Leadville. Didn't they notify\nyou?' 'No,' says Jeffard; 'it must be a mistake. I had no credit in\nLeadville.' All this time the cashier was digging into his pigeonholes.\n'You must have had,' says he. 'I can't put my hand on their letter,\nbut as I recall it, they said the money was a remittance made by you\nsometime last year to cover a promissory note. When it reached them\nthe note had matured and had been lifted. They have kept your money a\ngood while, but they claim not to have known your address.'\"\n\nMyra was listening with something more than curiosity.\n\n\"What did Mr. Jeffard say?\" she asked.\n\n\"He looked a good deal more than he said; and what he said was rather\nqueer. When he had pulled me a little aside, he lit a cigar and offered\nme one, as cool as ice. 'Of course, you'll understand that this was all\nprearranged between Mr. Holburn and myself,' says he. 'It would be too\ngreat a tax upon your credulity to ask you to believe that it is merely\na coincidence; that I really did send the money to the Leadville bank\nto lift that note months ago.' I said No, and meant it; and he went\nover to the exchange window and made out a check and bought that draft.\nBut afterward I could have kicked him for making that suggestion.\nI couldn't break away from it to save my life, and it stuck to me\nstraight through to the finish.\"\n\n\"But you went to luncheon with him afterward. Didn't he explain?\"\n\n\"Not a word. I tried my level best to pull the thing out of the hole\ntwo or three times, but it was buried too deep for me. And somehow that\nidiotic sneer of his seemed to color everything he said. He seemed to\ntake it for granted that I'd been setting him down all these months\nfor a scalawag, and everything I could say got twisted into a slap.\nWe worried through the meal, and the cigars after it, in some sort of\nthankless fashion; but I wouldn't do it again for a farm.\"\n\nMyra became reflectively thoughtful, and with the jarring of the car\nthe bit of money paper fell to the floor. Dick recovered it, put it\naway, and waited patiently for her comment. When it came it was no more\nthan a leading question.\n\n\"What do you make of it, Dick?\"\n\n\"I don't know what to make of it. If I could break away from all the\nthings I used to know about him, I should say he acts like a man who\nhas done something to make him declare war upon himself, and--as a\nnatural consequence--upon everybody else. He seems to be ready to fight\nat the drop of the hat, and that's a bad symptom.\"\n\n\"It is a symptom of a guilty conscience, isn't it?\"\n\nBartrow did not answer at once. To speak by the fact was to admit that\nall his loyal upholdings of Jeffard had been spent upon an unworthy\nobject, and he was reluctant in just proportion to his loyalty. But the\nfact was large--too large to be overleaped.\n\n\"It is a symptom, yes; and I'm beginning to be afraid it's a true one\nin Jeffard's case. I didn't find a soft spot in him anywhere till we\ncame to speak of Lansdale.\"\n\n\"They are still friends?\"\n\n\"Y--es, in a way; a sort of give-and-take way. Lansdale is cool and\npretty well-calculated in his friendships as in everything else; and I\nimagine he forgathers with Jeffard without prejudice to his own private\nconvictions in the Garvin affair. It's a bit odd, but Jeffard seems to\nhave most of the remembrances on his side.\"\n\n\"The kindly ones, you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes. I hadn't seen Lansdale yet, and I asked Jeffard how he was\nlooking. He wagged his head, and there was a look in his eyes that I'd\nseen there more than once in the old days. 'Unless there is something\nto be done more than has been tried, it's only a question of weeks,'\nsaid he; and then he went back to something I had said that morning in\nLeadville just before he climbed the engine for the race to Aspen.\"\n\nMyra's eyebrows arched a query, and he elucidated.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you? We had been talking about Connie, and I had hinted\nthat she'd be willing to buy health for Lansdale at a price; and he\"--\n\nMyra cut in swiftly. \"Has she told you that, Dick?\"\n\n\"Hardly; but I've eyes, haven't I? Well, as I was saying, Jeffard went\nback to that, and asked if Lansdale's recovery still meant as much to\nConnie. I told him I thought it meant rather more than less; and then\nhe went into his shell, and when he came out it was on the human side.\nSaid he had money to burn now, and asked if there was anything anybody\ncould do to give Lansdale a better show for his white alley. I told\nhim what I'd do if I could break away from the Myriad.\"\n\n\"I remember; you said you would take him afield.\"\n\n\"Yes. Rig up a team and a camping outfit, and chase him out into the\nmountains. Make him live outdoors for a month or two, and belt him over\nthe head if I ever caught him sharpening a lead pencil. He's grinding\naway with Kershaw nights and Sundays, and trying to write a novel\nbetween times. It's a clear case of work-to-death.\"\n\nMyra nodded. \"I think so; I have thought so all along. But he wouldn't\ngo with Mr. Jeffard.\"\n\n\"That's what I thought, and what I told Jeffard when he hinted at the\nthing. But we were both off; and that brings me to the other happening.\nAfter we'd smoked over it--Jeffard and I--we went around and hunted\nup Lansdale's doctor. The medicine-man agreed with me that it was the\nonly chance, but he didn't give us much encouragement. Said it was\na forlorn hope, with the odds against Lansdale; that he'd die if he\ndidn't go, and would probably die if he did. Jeffard had been in and\nout of his shell two or three times since the beginning of it, but he\ncame out again at that and stayed out. Said he owed Lansdale, and that\nwould be a good way to wipe out the account. I told him that wouldn't\ngo; that if he wanted to do Lansdale a good turn, he'd have to do it on\nits merits. 'I sha'n't be such a fool as to tell Lansdale I'm trying to\nsquare up with him,' says he. 'You go and persuade him.'\"\n\nMyra's hand was on his knee. \"You poor boy!\" she said; \"they always\nunload the thankless things on you, don't they? Did you try?\"\n\n\"Sure. If I'd felt like hanging back, a sight of Lansdale would have\ndone the business for me. It's awful, little woman. I've seen dead\nmen, and men that were going to die, but never a dying one that wanted\nso hard to live. Of course, he kicked clear over the traces when I\nproposed it, though I lied like a whitehead, and tried to make him\nbelieve it was my scheme to help Jeffard get cured of his case of\nmental and moral 'jimmies.' When that failed, I dug right down to\nhard-pan. 'You want to live, don't you?' said I, and when he admitted\nit, I biffed him square on the point of the jaw. Says I, 'Then it's a\nquestion of your stiff-necked New England pride against your love for a\nlittle girl who would give her right hand to see you well and strong,\nis it? You're not as good a man as I thought you were.'\"\n\nMyra was moved to protest. \"Oh, Dick! I do hope you haven't taken too\nmuch for granted! But go on; what did he say?\"\n\n\"I thought he'd rise up and fall on me at first; but he didn't. He\nmumbled something about the 'precious balms of a friend breaking his\nhead,' and said I was altogether mistaken; that Connie was only an\nangel of mercy, one of God's little ones, and a few other things of\nthat sort.\"\n\n\"'Only'!\" laughed Myra.\n\n\"Yes, 'only.' But I could see that my shoulder-blow had knocked him\nout. He switched the talk to Jeffard, and pretty soon he was asking\nme if I really thought he could do any good in that quarter; or if\nmy saying so was merely a lie cut out of whole cloth. I was soaked\nthrough by that time, and another plunge more or less didn't cut any\nfigure, so I told him it wasn't a lie; that there was still hope for\nJeffard if any one would lay hold of him and stick to him. 'What kind\nof hope, Dick?' says he. And I said, 'The only kind that counts; the\nkind that'll make him all through what he is in part.' He shook his\nhead at that, and said, 'I don't know. That would mean repentance and\nrestitution,--and the money's got its teeth into him now.' I'll have to\nadmit that I was arguing dead against the probabilities, and I knew it;\nbut I wouldn't let go.\"\n\nMyra's smile was tempered with affectionate pride. \"You never do let\ngo. Did he finally listen to reason?\"\n\n\"Yes, at the end of it. But if it were six for himself and Connie,\nit was a good half-dozen for Jeffard. 'I'll go, Dick,' said he. 'I'm\nafraid your assumptions are all good-hearted wishes, but I'll go.\nPerhaps, if it comes to the worst, God will give me a man for my\nleave-taking.' That was a new side of him, to me; the Puritan side,\nisn't it?\"\n\n\"The human side,\" she amended. \"It is merely crusted a little thicker\nin the Puritan family.\"\n\n\"But it's there, all the same. Out here, where the horizons and other\nthings are pretty wide open, we're apt to say what we think, and\npretty much all of it; but Lansdale and his kind think a good bit more\nand keep it to themselves. He's all right. I only wish his getting well\nwere as sure as the goodness of him. Are you getting sleepy? Want your\nberth made down?\"\n\n\"Presently.\" Myra was gazing out at the night-wall slipping past the\ncar windows, and for her the thick blackness mirrored a picture of a\nsweet-faced young woman sitting on a denim-covered lounge, with her\nhands tight clasped over one knee and her eyes alight with a soft\nstarglow of compassion. And because of the picture, she said: \"I'm\nafraid you didn't take too much for granted, Dick; and I could almost\nwish it were otherwise. It is heart-breaking to think of it.\"\n\nDick went over to a seat beside her, and tried to put himself as nearly\nas possible at her point of view.\n\n\"Let's not try to cross their bridges for them beforehand, little\nwoman,\" he said, with his lips at her ear. \"Life is pretty middling\nfull for all of us,--for us two, at any rate.\"\n\nIt was five minutes later, and the train had stopped for orders at the\ncanyon gateway, when she turned to him to say: \"What do you think about\nMr. Jeffard now, Dick? Are we all mistaken? or is he the hardened cynic\nhe seems to be?\"\n\nBartrow did not reply on the spur of the moment, as was his custom.\nWhen he had reasoned it out, he said:--\n\n\"I think we ought to break away from the notion that a man has got to\nbe either all angel or all devil. Jeffard's a human man, like the rest\nof us. He's done some good things that I know of,--and one pretty bad\none; and it's the bad one that is setting the pace for him just now.\nBut, as I once said to Lansdale, I'm betting on the finish. One bad\ncurve needn't spoil a whole railroad.\"\n\nMyra's hand sought and found his under cover of her wrap. \"You are\nloyalty itself, Dick, and I can't help loving you for it. But you say\n'one bad one.' Have you forgotten the Irish girl?\"\n\nDick set his jaw at that, and the big hand closed firmly over the small\none.\n\n\"When I have to believe that of him, Myra, my faith in my kind will\ndrop back more notches than one. That would make him all devil, don't\nyou see?\"\n\nBut her charity outran his. \"No, Dick; I don't quite see it. It is just\none more coil in the puzzle-tangle of good and evil that you spoke of.\nConnie knows it, and if she can find it in her heart to forgive him\"--\n\nThere was reverent awe in Bartrow's rejoinder. \"Do you mean to say\nshe'd forgive him--_that_?\"\n\nThe intermittent clatter and roar of the canyon climb had begun, and in\none of the breathing spaces Myra made answer.\n\n\"She is one of God's little ones, as Mr. Lansdale said. I think she\nwould forgive him even that.\" And in the next gap in the clamor, \"Did\nyou tell him about Garvin?\"\n\nDick shook his head. \"No, I didn't dare to. It's a hard thing to say,\nbut I'm not sure he wouldn't prosecute Jim for the attempt to kill.\nThere's no such vindictiveness in the world as that which dates back\nto benefits forgot. But I told Lansdale, and gave him leave to make\nuse of it if the time should ever come when he could do it without\njeopardizing Garvin.\"\n\nAt which Myra's charity stumbled and fell and ran no more.\n\n\"That time will never come, Dick. Mr. Jeffard has a double feud with\nGarvin,--he is Garvin's debtor for benefits forgot, as you say; and he\nhas done Garvin an injury. I am glad you didn't tell him.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n\n\"SHE'S gone to her rest, at last, poor soul, and it's happy she'd be if\nit wasn't for the childer.\"\n\nConstance had been waiting through the long hours of the afternoon\nfor Margaret's return from Owen David's shanty on the North Side;\nwaiting for the summons to the death-bed of the mother of Owen David's\nchildren. She had promised to go, wherefore her heart smote her and the\nready tears welled up at Margaret's announcement.\n\n\"Oh, Margaret! Why didn't you come for me!\"\n\n\"'Twas no use at all, Miss Constance; 'twas her last word she said to\nyou this morning, when she asked you to try once more with Owen for the\nchilder's sake. When you'd gone she turned her face to the wall, and we\nnever knew when her soul went out.\"\n\n\"Was Owen there?\"\n\n\"He was; and it's sober he was for the first time in many a day. He\ntook it hard; them Welsh are flighty people, anyway.\"\n\n\"He ought to take it hard,\" said Constance, with as near an approach\nto vindictiveness as the heart of compassion would sanction. \"Has\neverything been done?\"\n\nMargaret nodded. \"The neighbors were that kind; and it's poor\nhard-working people they are, too.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Constance. She was making ready to go out, and she found\nher purse and counted its keepings. They were as scanty as her will to\nhelp was plenteous. Myra's check had been generous, but the askings\nwere many, and there was no more than the sweet savor of it left. \"I'm\nsure I don't know what Owen will do,\" she went on. \"I suppose there\nisn't money enough to bury her.\"\n\nMargaret had taken off her hat and jacket and she was suddenly impelled\nto go to work. The lounge-cover was awry, and in the straightening of\nit she said:--\n\n\"Don't you be worrying about that, now, Miss Constance. It was Owen\nhimself that was giving me the money for the funeral when I was\nleaving.\"\n\n\"Owen? Where did he get it? He hasn't had a day's work for a month.\"\n\nMargaret was smoothing the cover and shaking the pillows vigorously.\n\"Sure, that's just what I was thinking\" (slap, slap), \"but I've his\nmoney in my pocket this blessed minute. So you just go and say a sweet\nword to the childer, Miss Constance, and don't you be worrying about\nanything.\"\n\nConnie's hand was on the door-knob, but she turned with a sudden\nsinking of the heart, and a swift impulse that sent her across the room\nto Margaret's side.\n\n\"Margaret, you gave Owen that money before he gave it to you. Where did\nyou get it?\"\n\nMargaret left off beating the pillows and slipped upon her knees to\nbury her face in one of them.\n\n\"I knew you'd be asking that,\" she sobbed, and then: \"Haven't I been\nworking honest every day since Christmas? And does it be taking all I\nearn to keep me, I'd like to know?\"\n\nConstance went down on her knees beside the girl, and what she said\nwas to One who was merciful even to the Magdalenes. When she rose the\npain of it was a little dulled, and she went back to the charitable\nnecessities in a word.\n\n\"Is there any one to watch with her to-night, Margaret?\"\n\nThe girl lifted a tear-stained face, and the passionate Irish eyes were\nswimming, and Constance turned away because her loving compassion was\ngreater than her determination to be judicially severe.\n\n\"I'm one,\" Margaret answered; \"and Mrs. Mulcahey'll come over when her\nman gets home.\"\n\n\"Very well. I'll go over and give the children their suppers and put\nthem to bed. I'll stay till you come, and you can bring Tommie to take\nme home.\"\n\nConstance went upon her mission heavy-hearted; and in the hovel\nacross the river found comfort in the giving of comfort. The David\nchildren were all little ones, too young to fully realize their loss;\nand when they had been fed and hushed to sleep, and one of David's\nfellow workmen had taken the husband away for the night, Constance\nsat down in the room with the dead to wait for Margaret. For a heart\nless pitiful or a soul less steadfast, the silence of the night and\nthe solitary watch with the sheeted figure on the bed might have been\nunnerving; but in all her life Constance had never had to reckon with\nfear. Hence, when the door opened behind her without a preliminary\nknock, and a footstep crossed the threshold, she thought it was one of\nthe neighbors and rose softly with her finger on her lip. But when she\nsaw who it was, she started back and made as if she would retreat to\nthe room where the children were.\n\n\"You!\" she said. \"Why are you here?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon.\" Jeffard said it deferentially, almost humbly. \"I\ndidn't expect to find you here; I was looking for--for the man, you\nknow. What has become of him?\"\n\nThe hesitant pause in the midst of the explanation opened the door for\na swift suspicion,--a suspicion too horrible to be entertained, and yet\ntoo strong to be driven forth. There was righteous indignation in her\neyes when she went close to him and said:--\n\n\"Can you stand here in the presence of that\"--pointing to the sheeted\nfigure on the bed--\"and lie to me? You expected to meet Margaret Gannon\nhere. You have made an appointment with her--an assignation in the\nhouse of the dead. Shame on you!\"\n\nIt should have crushed him. It did for the moment. And when he rallied\nit was apparently in a spirit of the sheerest hardihood.\n\n\"You are right,\" he said; \"I did expect to meet Margaret. With your\npermission, I'll go outside and wait for her.\"\n\nShe flashed between him and the door and put her back to it.\n\n\"Not until you have heard what I have to say, Mr. Jeffard. I've been\nwanting to say it ever since Tommie told me, but you have been very\ncareful not to give me a chance. You know this girl's story, and what\nshe has had to fight from day to day. Are you so lost to every sense of\njustice and mercy as to try to drag her back into sin and shame after\nall her pitiful strugglings?\"\n\n\"It would seem so,\" Jeffard retorted, and his smile was harder than his\nwords. \"It is quite conceivable that you should believe it of the man\nwho once took your charity and made a mock of it. May I go now?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, not yet; not until you have promised me to spare and slay not,\nfor this once. Think of it a moment; it is the price of a human soul!\nAnd it is such a little thing for you to concede.\"\n\nThe hard smile came and went again.\n\n\"Another man might say that Margaret has come to be very beautiful,\nMiss Elliott.\"\n\nThe indignation was gone out of her eyes, and her lips were trembling.\n\n\"Oh, how can you be so hard!\" she faltered. \"Will nothing move you?\"\n\nHe met the beseeching with a steady gaze that might have been the\noutlooking of a spirit of calm superiority or the cold stare of a\ndemon of ruthlessness. The mere suggestion of the alternative made her\nhot and cold by turns.\n\n\"I wonder that you have the courage to appeal to me,\" he said, at\nlength. \"Are you not afraid?\"\n\n\"For Margaret's sake I am not afraid.\"\n\n\"You are very brave--and very loyal. Do you wonder that I was once\nmoved to tell you that I loved you?\"\n\n\"How can you speak of that here--and now!\" she burst out. \"Is there no\nmeasure of the hardness of your heart? Is it not enough that you should\nmake me beg for that which I have a right to demand?\"\n\nHe went apart from her at that to walk softly up and down in the\nnarrow space between the bed and the wall,--to walk for leaden-winged\nminutes that seemed hours to Constance, waiting for his answer. At the\nfinal turn he lifted the sheet from the face of the dead woman and\nlooked long and earnestly, as one who would let death speak where life\nwas dumb and inarticulate. Constance watched him with her heart in a\nturmoil of doubt and fear. The doubt was of her own making, as the fear\nwas of his. She had thought that this man was known to her, in his\npotentialities for good or evil, in his stumblings upon the brink of\nthe abyss, and in his later plunge into the depths of wrongdoing; but\nnow that she was brought face to face with him, her prefigurings took\nnew shapes and she feared to look upon them. For the potentialities\nhad suddenly become superhuman, and love itself stood aghast at the\npossibilities. In the midst of it he stood before her again.\n\n\"What is it that you would have me do?\" he asked.\n\nThe tone of it assured her that her battle was fought and won; but at\nthe moment of victory she had not the strength to make terms with him.\n\n\"You know what you ought to do,\" she said, with eyes downcast.\n\n\"The 'oughts' are sometimes terribly hard, Miss Elliott. Haven't you\nfound them so?\"\n\n\"Sometimes.\" She was finding one of them sufficiently hard at that\nmoment to compel the admission.\n\n\"But they are never impossible, you would say, and that is true also.\nYou asked me a few moments ago if there was nothing that would move me,\nand I was tempted. But that is past. Will you suffer me to go now?\"\n\nShe stood aside, but her hand was still on the latch of the door.\n\n\"You have not promised,\" she said.\n\n\"Pardon me; I was hoping you would spare me. The cup is of my own\nmixing, but the lees are bitter. Must I drain them?\"\n\n\"I--I don't understand,\" she rejoined.\n\n\"Don't you? Consider it a moment. You have taken it for granted that I\nhad it in my heart to do this thing, and, knowing what you do of me,\nthe inference is just. But I have not admitted it, and I had hoped you\nwould spare me the admission which a promise would imply. Won't you\nleave me this poor shadow of refutation?\"\n\nShe opened the door for him.\n\n\"Thank you; it is much more than I deserve. Since you do not ask\nit, you shall have the assurance,--the best I can give. I shall\nleave Denver in a day or two, and you may take your own measures for\nsafeguarding Margaret in the interval. Perhaps it won't be as difficult\nas you may imagine. If I have read her aright you may ask large things\nof her loyalty and devotion to you.\"\n\nThe battle was over, and she had but to hold her peace to be quit of\nhim. But having won her cause it was not in the loving heart of her to\nlet him go unrecompensed.\n\n\"You are going away? Then we may not meet again. I gave you bitter\nwords a few minutes ago, Mr. Jeffard, but I believed they were true.\nWon't you deny them--if you can?\"\n\nHis foot was across the threshold, but he turned to smile down upon her.\n\n\"You are a true woman. You said I lied to you, and now you ask me to\ndeny it, knowing well enough that the denial will afterward stand for\nanother falsehood. I know what you think of me,--what you are bound to\nthink of me; but isn't it conceivable that I would rather quench that\nfire than add fuel to it?\"\n\n\"But you are going away,\" she insisted.\n\n\"And since we may never meet again, you crave the poor comfort of a\ndenial. You shall have it for what it is worth. When you are inclined\nto think charitably of me, go back to first principles and remember\nthat the worst of men have sometimes had promptings which were not\naltogether unworthy. Let the major accusation stand, if you choose; I\ndid have an appointment here with Margaret Gannon. But when your faith\nin humankind needs heartening, conceive that for this once the tryst\nwas one which any woman might have kept with me. Believe, if you care\nto, that my business here this evening was really with this poor fellow\nwhose sins have found him out. Would you like to be able to believe\nthat?\"\n\nFor the first time since doubt and fear had gotten the better of\nindignation she was able to lift her eyes to his.\n\n\"I will believe it,\" she said gratefully.\n\nHe smiled again, and she was no longer afraid. Now that she came to\nthink of it, she wondered if she had ever been really afraid of him.\n\n\"Your faith is very beautiful, Miss Elliott. I am glad to be able to\ngive it something better than a bare suggestion to build on. Will you\ngive this to Margaret when she comes?\"\n\nIt was a folded paper, with a printed title and indorsement blanks on\nthe back. She took it and glanced at the filing. It was the deed to a\nburial lot in the name of Owen David.\n\n\"Oh!\" she said; and there was a world of contrition and self-reproach\nin the single word. \"Can you ever forgive me, Mr. Jeffard?\"\n\nAs once before, when Lansdale had proffered it, Jeffard pushed aside\nthe cup of reinstatement.\n\n\"Don't take too much for granted. Remember, the indictment still\nstands. Margaret Gannon's tempter might have done this and still merit\nyour detestation.\"\n\nAnd at the word she was once more alone with the still figure on the\nbed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n\nFOR what reason Constance, left alone in the house of the dead, went\nsoftly from the lighted room to kneel at the bedside of the sleeping\nchildren in the lean-to beyond--to kneel with her face in her hands and\nher heart swelling with emotions too great for any outlet save that\nof sorrowful beseechings,--let those adjudge who have passed in some\ncrucial moment from loss to gain, and back to loss again. There was\na pitiful heart cry in the prayer for help because she knew now that\nlove, mighty and unreasoning, must be reckoned with in every future\nthought of this man; love heedless of consequences, clinging first to\nan imagined ideal, and now to the sorrowful wreck of that ideal; love\nlashed into being, it may be, by the very whip of shame, acknowledged\nonly to be chained and dungeoned in the Castle of Despair, but alive\nand pleading, and promising yet to live and plead though hope were dead.\n\nIt was thus that Margaret found her an hour later; and in the darkness\nof the little room the true-hearted Irish girl knelt beside her saint,\nwith her strong arms around the weeping one, and a sob of precious\nsympathy in the outpouring of words.\n\n\"There now--there now, Miss Constance! is it kneeling here and crying\nfor these poor left ones that you are? Sure it's the Holy Virgin\nherself that'll be mothering them, and the likes of them. And Owen'll\nbe doing his part, too. It's a changed man he is.\"\n\nConstance shook her head. She was too sincere to let the lesser reason\nstand for the greater, even with Margaret.\n\n\"I do grieve for them, Margaret; but--but it isn't that.\"\n\n\"It isn't that, do you say? Then I know full well what it is, and it's\nthe truth I'm going to tell you, Miss Constance, for all the promisings\nhe made me give him. 'Tis Mr. Jeffard's money that's to go for the\nfuneral, and it was him left it with me to give to Owen. He told me\nyou'd not take it from him, and 'twas his own free gift. Ever since he\ncame back he's been giving me money for the poor ones, and making me\nswear never to tell you; but it was for your sweet sake, Miss Connie,\nand not for mine. I'd want to die if you didn't believe that.\"\n\n\"Oh, Margaret! are you telling me the truth? I do so want to believe\nit!\"\n\nMargaret rose and drew her confessor to the half-open door; to the\nbedside of the sheeted one.\n\n\"A little while ago she was alive and talking to you, Miss Constance,\nand you believed her because you knew she was going fast. If I'd be\nlike that, I'd tell you the same.\"\n\n\"I believe you, Margaret--I do believe you; and, oh, I'm _so_ thankful!\nIt would break my heart to have you go back now!\"\n\n\"Don't you be worrying for me. Didn't I say once that the devil might\nfly away with me, but I'd not live to leave him have the good of it?\nWhen that time comes, Miss Constance, it's another dead woman you'll be\ncrying over. And now you'll go home and take your rest; the good old\nfather is waiting on the doorstep for you.\"\n\nEven with his daughter, Stephen Elliott was the most reticent of men;\nand on the little journey up the river front and across the viaduct he\nplodded along in silence beside her, waiting for her to speak if she\nhad anything to say. Constance had a heart full to overflowing, but not\nof the things which lend themselves to speech with any father; and when\nshe broke the silence it was in self-defense, and on the side of the\ncommonplace.\n\n\"Have you decided yet where you will go?\" she asked, knowing that the\narrangements for the prospecting trip were all but completed.\n\n\"N--no, not exactly. Except that I never have gone with the rush, and I\ndon't mean to this time. There's some pretty promising country around\nup back of Dick's mountain, and I've been thinking of that.\"\n\n\"I wish you would go into the Bonanza district,\" she said. \"If I'm to\nstay with Dick and Myra, it will be a comfort to know that you are not\nvery far away.\"\n\nThe old man plodded another square before he succeeded in casting his\nthought into words.\n\n\"I was wondering if that wasn't the reason why I want to go there. I'm\nnot letting on to anybody about it, but I'm getting sort of old and\ntrembly, Connie; and you're about all I have left.\"\n\nShe slipped her arm an inch or two farther through his. \"Must it be,\npoppa? Can't we get along without it? I'll be glad to live like the\npoorest of them, if we can only be together.\"\n\n\"I know; you're a good daughter to me, Connie, and you'd go into the\nhospital on Dr. Gordon's offer to-morrow, if I'd say the word. But I\nthink the last strike I made rather spoiled me. I got sort of used to\nthe flesh-pots, and I haven't got over feeling for my check-book yet. I\nguess I'll have to try it once more before we go on the county.\"\n\nShe would have said more had there been more to say. But her arguments\nhad all been exhausted when the prospecting fever had set in, and\nshe could only send him forth with words of heartening and a brave\nGod-speed.\n\n\"I'm not going to put things in the way,\" she said; \"but I'd go with\nyou and help dig, if you'd let me. The next best thing will be to have\nyou somewhere within reach, and I shall be comforted if you can manage\nto keep Topeka Mountain in sight. But you won't.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will, daughter; the string pulls about as hard at my end as\nit does at yours, and I'll tell you what I'll do. The gulches that I\nhad in mind are all up at the head of Myriad Creek, and I'll ship the\n'stake' to Dick, and make the Myriad a sort of outfitting camp. How\nwill that strike you?\"\n\n\"That will be fine,\" she said; adding, in an upflash of the old gayety:\n\"and when you've located your claim, Myra and I will come and turn the\nwindlass for you.\"\n\nThey were climbing the stairs to the darkened suite on the third floor,\nand at the door Constance found a telegraph messenger trying to pin\na non-delivery notice to the panel. She signed his blank by the hall\nlight, and read the message while her father was unlocking the door and\nlighting the lamp.\n\n\"It is from Myra,\" she explained; \"and it's good news and bad. Do you\nremember what Dick was telling us the other evening about his drunken\nblacksmith?\"\n\n\"The fellow that went into the blast-choke after the dead man?\"\n\n\"Yes. He is down with mountain fever, and Myra says nothing but good\nnursing will save him. Dick has got his story out of him at last; he is\nMargaret Gannon's father.\"\n\n\"Humph! what a little world this is! I suppose you will send Margaret\nright away?\"\n\n\"I shall go with her to-morrow morning. I'll tell Dick what you are\ngoing to do, and you can come when you are ready.\"\n\nThe old man nodded acquiescence. \"It'll be better for you to go along;\nshe'll be all broke up. Want me to go and wire Dick?\"\n\n\"If you will. I should have asked the boy to wait, but he was gone\nbefore I had opened the envelope. Tell Dick to keep him alive at any\ncost, and that we'll be there to-morrow evening.\"\n\nWhen her father was gone, Constance sat down to piece out the\ndiscoveries, comforting and harrowing, of the foregone hour, and to\nset them over against each other in a field which was as yet too near\nto be retrospective. She tried to stand aside for herself, and to see\nand consider only those to whom her heart went out in loving compassion\nand sympathy; but it was inevitable that she should finally come to a\nre-reading of the letter taken from its hiding-place in the photograph\nframe. She dwelt upon it with a soft flush spreading slowly from neck\nto cheek, reading it twice and yet once again before she laid it in the\nlittle wall-pocket of a grate and touched a match to it.\n\n\"For his sake and for mine,\" she said softly, as she watched it shrivel\nand blacken in the flame. \"That is what I must do--burn my ships so\nthat I can't go back.\"\n\nThe charred wraith of the letter went up the chimney in the expiring\ngasp of the flame, and there was the sound of a familiar step in the\ncorridor. She went quickly to open the door for the late visitor. It\nwas Lansdale, come to say what must be said on the eve of parting, and\nto ask for his answer to a conditional plea made in a moment when the\nconsumptive's optimism had carried him off his feet.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n\nTHE periods of the scene-shifter, in life as in life's mimicking on any\nstage, have fallen into disesteem. In any flight of fancy or plodding\njourney of fact these are flat countries to be traversed; interregnums\nwhich, however replete with incident for the actors themselves,\nare deemed alike unworthy of the playwright's outworking or the\nchronicler's recording. To the audience waiting beyond the footlights\nthese are mere breathing spaces of music-hastened minutes standing\nfor whatever lapses of days, weeks or months the story of the play\ninvolves; but for the scene-shifter they are gaps toil-filled, with\nfierce strivings and wrestlings and doughty compellings of the animate\nand inanimate perversities.\n\nNone the less, for the toiler behind the scenes there are\ncompensations, for the audience, the _entr'acte_ is a solution\nof continuity, more or less skillfully bridged, according to the\nplaywright's gift; but the worker of transformations knows no break in\nthe action. For him the story of the play is complete, marching evenly\nto its climax through spoken line and drop-curtained interregnum.\n\nThe curtain has rung down upon an interior in an apartment house.\nIt is to rise upon a flashlight picture of a summer night scene in\na mountain-girt valley. The walls of the homelike interior vanish,\nand in their stead dim reaches of the forest-clad mountains suggest\nthemselves. A stream tumbles over the boulders in its bed with a hollow\nroar hinting at canyoned plungings above; and on the margin of it a\nquaking aspen blinks its many-lidded eyes in the light of a camp fire.\n\nAgainst the pillared background of forest, primeval firs whose sombre\ngreens become murky black in the firelight, a campers' wagon is drawn\nup; and the picket pins of the grazing horses are driven in a grass\ngrown extension of the glade to the right. There is a silken whisper\nabroad in the night, rising and falling upon the sound waves of the\ntumbling stream: the voices of the trees as they call to each other in\nthe night wind pouring softly down from the sky-pitched peaks.\n\nThe scene is set and the actors are in their places. They are two men\nclad in flannel shirts and brown duck overalls and shooting-coats. One\nof them is bearded and bronzed, with the well-knit figure of conscious\nstrength. The other is of slighter frame, and on his clean-shaven face\nthe prolonged holiday in the open is but now beginning to impress the\nstamp of returning health and vigor. The bearded man is on his back\nbeside the fire, with his clasped hands for a pillow and an extinct\npipe between his teeth. The clean-shaven one is propped against the\nbole of a tree; his eyes are closed, and his pipe has slipped from his\nfingers.\n\nA brand falls into the glowing mass of embers, and the sparks fly\nupward in a crackling shower. It is the prompter's call-bell. The man\nreclining at the tree-foot opens his eyes, and the bearded one sits up\nand feels mechanically for the tobacco pouch.\n\n\"Here it is,\" says Lansdale. \"I was just about to fill up again when\nthe realities slipped away. It's astonishing how one can sleep overtime\nin these upper levels.\"\n\nThe athletic one rises and stretches till his joints crack. \"Been\nasleep, have you? So have I. There's no opiate in the world like a\nday's tramping in the altitudes. Freshen you up any?\"\n\n\"As to body, yes. But I've had a curious dream--if it were a dream.\"\nSilence while the sob of the river rises and falls on the night\nwind, and then a half-hesitant query. \"Jeffard, do you believe in\npresentiments?\"\n\nThe bearded one is on his knees before the fire, pressing a live coal\ninto the bowl of his pipe, and the answer is delayed.\n\n\"I don't know whether I do or not; I have never had one.\"\n\n\"But you have known of others having them, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Of one other: but in that instance it was foreknowledge rather than a\nforeboding. The presentiment should have been mine; and I had none.\"\n\n\"Would you mind telling me about it?\"\n\n\"No. It was while I was making the survey for a logging railway in\nQuebec. I expected to be out all summer, but in the middle of it the\ncompany called a halt and I went home. I hadn't wired or written, but\nwhen I reached Hinsdale my father was at the station to meet me. For\nthree days my mother had been insisting that I would come, and to quiet\nher they had been meeting the trains. She died the next evening.\"\n\n\"And you had no premonition?\"\n\n\"None whatever. For a month or more I had been beyond the reach of the\nmails; and I had left her in her usual health. It was a bolt out of a\nclear sky.\"\n\nAgain the brawling stream and the whispering leaves fill the gap of\nsilence; and as before, Lansdale is the first to speak.\n\n\"I have always scouted such things, as sanity seems to demand. Stories\nwith any element of the supernatural in them have never appealed to\nme because, however well authenticated, they were always stories, and\nnever actual happenings in which I had any part. But for the last day\nor two I've had a growing sense of impending calamity, and I can't\nshake it off.\"\n\nThere is the brusquerie of heartening in Jeffard's rejoinder.\n\n\"Nonsense! It's only the imaginative part of you kicking against the\npricks of a longish holiday.\"\n\n\"That is ingenious, but I can't quite accept it. I've eaten and slept\nwith the imaginative fiend long enough to be pretty well acquainted\nwith his vagaries. This is altogether different. It is precisely the\nfeeling you have had just before a storm; a sense of depression as\nintangible as darkness, but quite as real. It was with me a few minutes\nago when I fell asleep, and the dream seemed to be a part of it.\"\n\n\"Oh, dreams,\" says the scoffer; \"I thought they had been accounted\nfor by the dietists. I told you that last batch of panbread held\npossibilities. But go on and unload your dream. I'm shudder-proof.\"\n\nLansdale tells it circumstantially, keeping his pipe alight in the\nperiods.\n\n\"It didn't seem like a dream; at least, not in the beginning of it.\nI was sitting here just as I am now, and you were on your back over\nthere, with the pipe in your mouth. The surroundings were the same,\nexcept that the fire was burning low. I remember thinking that you must\nhave fallen asleep, and wondering why the pipe didn't fall and wake\nyou. After a time the roar of the stream seemed to quiet down, and I\nheard the clink of horseshoes upon stone. The sound came from across\nthe stream, and as I looked I saw a trail and a horseman coming down\nit. It was all so real that I wondered why I hadn't noticed the trail\nbefore. The man rode down to the water's edge and made as if he would\ncross. I saw him quite distinctly, and thought it curious, because the\nfire was too low to give much light. He merely glanced at the stream,\nand then turned his horse's head and rode down the opposite bank. He\npassed out of sight among the trees, and a moment later I heard the\nhorse's hoofs again, this time as if he were on a bridge of poles.\"\n\nJeffard has been listening with attention no more than decently alert,\nbut at this point he breaks in to say: \"You've been walking in your\nsleep. Go on.\"\n\n\"It was just here that the supernatural came in. I told you that the\nman had passed out of sight, but all at once I seemed to see him again.\nHe was on a corduroy bridge crossing the stream, and I saw plainly what\nhe did not,--that the bridge was unsafe, and that a step or two would\nplunge him into the torrent. I don't remember what followed, save that\nI tried to call out, first to him and then to you; but my voice seemed\nto be swallowed up in the thunder of the water. There was a little gap\nfilled with fierce strugglings, and then I seemed to be here again,\nlying by the wagon with a blanket over me; and you were walking up and\ndown with another man,--a stranger. That is all; except that I tried\nto tell you that you were wet through and would take cold,--tried and\ncouldn't, and awoke.\"\n\nJeffard has risen to put another log on the fire.\n\n\"It's the panbread,\" he says, with the air of one who sweeps the\nboard for a resetting of the pieces. But after a little he adds: \"I\nwas wondering how you came to know about the bridge. That is the only\nunaccountable twist in it.\"\n\n\"Is there a bridge?\"\n\n\"Yes; it's just below that farther clump of aspens. But there is\nnothing the matter with it that I could see. I noticed it while I was\npicketing the horses.\"\n\n\"And is there a trail on the other side of the stream?\"\n\n\"There is. There used to be a ford just here, but it was dangerous, and\nwe built the bridge.\"\n\n\"Then you have been here before?\"\n\n\"Yes, many times. I spent the better half of a summer and all of\none winter in this valley. The Midas is just below here. I meant to\nsurprise you to-morrow morning.\"\n\nLansdale's gaze is in the heart of the fire and his voice is low. \"Do\nyou know, Henry, I'm rather glad you didn't wait? Don't ask me why,\nbecause I can't tell you in terms divisible by the realities. But\nsomehow the to-morrows don't seem to be assured.\"\n\n\"Oh, pshaw! that's your dream--and the panbread its father. If you had\ntalked that way a month ago, when you were really living from hand to\nmouth\"--\n\nLansdale spreads his hands palms down and looks at them.\n\n\"You promised me a new lease of life, Henry, and you've given it\nme,--or the key to it. I didn't believe it could be done, and my chief\ntrouble in those first days was the thought that you'd have to bury\nme alone. And when we camped in a particularly rocky spot, I used to\nwonder how you would manage it.\"\n\nJeffard's smile is of grimness. \"If you had mentioned it, I could have\nhelped you off with that burden. These mountains are full of graves,\nready-made; prospect holes, where the better part of many a man lies\nburied. Do you see that heap of earth and stone over yonder?\"\n\nLansdale shades his eyes from the firelight and looks and sees.\n\n\"That is one of them. Just behind that heap there is a shaft with a\nwindlass across it, and for six weeks two men worked early and late\ndigging a hole,--which turned out to be an excellent well when the\nwater came in and stopped them.\"\n\n\"And the water was bitter,\" says Lansdale. \"Did you drink of it, Henry?\"\n\n\"No; but the other man did, and he went mad.\"\n\nOnce more the stream and the sighing night wind share the silence. For\nmany days Lansdale has been assuring himself that the golden moment\nfor speech of the helpful sort must ultimately be made and not waited\nfor. In the hour when he had consented to Bartrow's urgings he had been\ngiven to see his opportunity and had determined to grasp it,--had made\nthe determination the excuse for sharing Jeffard's hospitality. He can\nlook back upon that resolve now and see that it was perfunctory; that\nthe prompting had been of duty and not at all of love for the man.\nBut the weeks of close companionship have wrought more miracles than\none, and not the least among them is a great amazement builded upon\nthe daily renewal of Jeffard's loving-kindnesses. For the man with the\nworld-quarrel has been a brother indeed; nurse, physician, kinsman, and\nsuccoring friend; with the world-quarrel put aside from the moment of\noutsetting, and with apparently no object in life less worthy than that\nof fighting a vicarious battle for a sick man. The summary of it is\nhumanizing, and the last upholdings of the crust of reserve break down\nin the warmth of it.\n\n\"May I speak as the spirit moves, Henry?\"\n\n\"If you think I deserve it. Why shouldn't you?\"\n\n\"It is a question of obligations rather than of deservings,--my\nobligations. No brother of my own blood could have done more for me\nthan you have.\"\n\n\"And you want to even it up?\"\n\n\"No; but I want to tell you while I may that it has come very near to\nme in these last few days. At first I was inclined to make another\nquery of it, and to speculate as to your probable motive; but latterly\nI've come to call it by its right name.\"\n\nJeffard shakes his head slowly, and removes his pipe to say: \"Don't\nmake any more mistakes, Lansdale. I'm neither better nor worse than I\nwas that night when I told you the story of the man and his temptation.\nI know what you mean and what you would say; but this experiment and\nits results--the twenty odd pounds of flesh you have put on, and the\nnew lease of life they stand for--mean more to me than they do to you.\"\n\n\"I don't begin to understand the drift of that,\" says Lansdale.\n\n\"No? I wonder if you would understand and believe if I should tell\nyou the truth; if I should confess that my motive, so far as you are\nconcerned, is entirely selfish?\"\n\n\"Since understanding implies belief, I shall have to say no to that.\nBut you might try,--for your own satisfaction.\"\n\n\"It's altogether unprofitable; but perhaps it's your due. I'll have\nto go back a little to make it clear. In the old days we were pretty\ngood friends, but I think you will admit that there have always been\nreservations. You haven't known me and I haven't known you as friends\nof the David and Jonathan sort know each other. Isn't that so?\"\n\nLansdale is constrained to say \"Yes,\" wishing it were otherwise.\n\nJeffard refills his pipe and fishes for another live coal in the\nfire-fringe. The _g-r-r-rh_ of the grazing horses comes from the\nnear-by glade, and again the silence begins to grow. Suddenly he says:\n\"Let's drop it, Lansdale, and talk about something else.\"\n\n\"No, go on; nothing you can say will efface the brotherly fact.\"\n\n\"Very well,--if you will have it. You said you were inclined to\nquestion my motive. It was more than questionable; it was frankly\nselfish.\"\n\n\"Selfish? You'll have to spell it out large for me. From my point of\nview it seems rather the other way about. What had you to gain by\nsaddling yourself with the care of a sick man?\"\n\n\"I can't put it in words--not without laying myself open to the charge\nof playing to the gallery. But let me state a fact and ask a question.\nA year ago you thought it was all up with you, and you didn't seem to\ncare much. A few months later I found you fighting for your life like\na shipwrecked sailor with land in sight. What did it?\"\n\nThat the lava-crust of reserve is altogether molten is evinced in\nLansdale's straightforward reply.\n\n\"Love,--love for a woman. I think you must have known that.\"\n\n\"I did. That was why you were making the desperate fight for life; and\nthat is why we are here to-night, you and I. I love the woman, too.\"\n\nLansdale shakes his head slowly, and an ineffable smile is Jeffard's\nreward.\n\n\"And yet you call it selfishness, Henry. Man, man! you have\ndeliberately gone about to save my life when another might have taken\nit!\"\n\n\"I shall reap where I have sown,\" says Jeffard steadily. \"Latterly I\nhave been living for one day,--the day when I can take you back to her\nin the good hope that she will forget what has been for the sake of\nwhat I have tried to make possible.\"\n\nOnce more Lansdale's gaze is in the glowing heart of the fire, and the\nlight in his eyes is prophetic.\n\n\"Verily, you shall reap, Henry; but not in a field where you have sown.\nDon't ask me how I know. That's my secret. But out of all this will\ncome a thing not to be measured by your prefigurings. You shall have\nyour reward; but I crave mine, too. Will you give it me?\"\n\n\"If it be mine to give.\"\n\n\"It is. Do justice and love mercy, Henry. That is the thing I've been\ntrying to find words to say to you all these weeks.\"\n\nJeffard lays the pipe aside and does not pretend to misunderstand.\n\n\"Tell me what you would like to have me do.\"\n\n\"I think you must know: find the man who drank of the bitter waters and\nwent mad, and give him back that which you have taken from him.\"\n\n\"Isn't there a possibility that I can do neither?\"\n\n\"I can help you to do the first,--and for the other I can only plead. I\nknow what you would say: that the man had forfeited his right; that he\ntried to kill you; that by all the laws of man's inventing this money\nis yours. But God's right and your debt to your own manhood are above\nall these. As your poor debtor, I'm privileged to ask large things of\nyou; can't you break the teeth of it and shake yourself free of the\nmoney-dragon?\"\n\nJeffard is afoot, tramping a monotonous sentry beat between the wagon\nand the fire. His rejoinder is a question.\n\n\"Do you know where James Garvin is to be found?\"\n\n\"I don't, but Bartrow does.\"\n\n\"Why didn't he tell me?\"\n\n\"Because Dick is merciful. The man is a criminal, and you could send\nhim to the penitentiary.\"\n\n\"And Dick thought--and you have thought--that I would prosecute him.\nIt was the natural inference, I suppose,--from your point of view. The\nman who would rob his partner wouldn't stumble over a little thing like\nthat. Will it help you to sleep the sounder if I say that vengeance\nisn't in me?--wasn't in me even in the white heat of it?\"\n\nLansdale nods assent. \"I'm on the asking hand, and any concession\nis grateful. If you were vindictive about it, I'm afraid the major\ncontention would be hopeless.\"\n\n\"But as it is you do not despair?\"\n\n\"I am very far from despairing, Henry. You spoke lightly of our\nfriendship a little while ago, and one time I should have agreed with\nyou. But I know you better now, and the incredibility of this thing\nthat you have done has been growing upon me. It's the one misshapen\ncolumn in a fair temple. Won't you pull it down and set up another in\nits place,--a clean-cut pillar of uprightness, which will harmonize\nwith the others?\"\n\nJeffard stops short at the tree-bole, with his hand on Lansdale's\nshoulder.\n\n\"It has taken me five weeks to find out why you consented to come\nafield with me,\" he says. \"It was to say this, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Just that,\" says Lansdale, and his voice is the voice of one pleading\nas a mother pleads. \"Say you will do it, Henry; if not for your own\nsake or mine, for the sake of that which has brought us together here.\"\n\nJeffard has turned away again, but he comes back at that to stand\nbefore Garvin's advocate.\n\n\"It is a small thing you have asked, Lansdale,\" he says, after a time;\n\"much smaller than you think. The pillar isn't altogether as crooked as\nit looks; there is something in the perspective. You know how the old\nGreek builders used to set the corner column out of the perpendicular\nto make it appear plumb. We don't always do that; sometimes we can't\ndo it without bringing the whole structure down about our ears. But in\nthis case your critical eye shall be satisfied. We'll go down to the\nmine in the morning and use Denby's wire. If Bartrow can find Garvin,\nyou shall see how easily the dragon's teeth may be broken. Is that what\nyou wanted me to say?\"\n\nLansdale's answer is a quotation.\n\n\"'And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking ... that\nthe soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan\nloved him as his own soul.' I've seen my reward and felt of it; and\nyours will come a little later,--in a way you little dream of. Pass the\ntobacco, and let's have another whiff or two before we turn in. I'm too\nacutely thankful to be sleepy.\"\n\nFor a peaceful half-hour they sit before the glowing embers, smoking\nplacidly while their talk drifts hither and yon over the spent sea of\nboyhood and youth. It is a heartening half-hour, and at the end of it\nJeffard rises to get the blankets from the wagon. Lansdale elects to\nsleep at his tree-root, and he is rolling himself in his blanket when\nJeffard says:\n\n\"How about the presentiment? Have we tired it out?\"\n\nLansdale laughs softly. \"It's gone,\" he says. \"Perhaps it was nothing\nmore than an upheaval of conscience. I'm subject to that when I've\nanything on my mind. Good-night, and God bless you, Henry.\"\n\nAnd so the curtain goes down upon the summer night scene in the\nmountain-girt valley, with the two men sleeping peacefully before\nthe fire, and the stars shining softly in the patch of velvety sky\noverhead. The midnight ebb of the snow-fed stream has set in, and the\nthrobbing roll of the water drum is muffled. The fire burns low. The\nwhispering leaves are stilled, and the wind slipping down from the\nsnow coifs, sinks to a sigh. The pinions of the night are folded, and\ndarkness and murmurous silence wrap the mantle of invisibility around\nthe camp in the glade.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\nIT is the gray dawn that lifts the curtain, and in the little glade\nwhere the two men slept there are three figures, dim and ghostly in\nthe morning's twilight. Two of them are afoot, heavy-eyed and weary,\ntramping a slow-paced beat on the margin of the tumbling stream. The\nthird is a still shape lying blanket-covered beside the wagon.\n\n\"Tell me about it, Denby,\" says one of the watchers, and his voice\nbreaks in the saying of it. \"I think I can bear it now. How did it\nhappen?\"\n\nThe master of men shakes his head. \"I can't tell you anything more than\nthe bald fact, Jeffard. I rode down the trail ahead of Higgins, and\nshould have forded the creek here, only I didn't want to disturb you\ntwo. I went on to the bridge, and in the act of crossing he ran down\nthe bank on this side, calling to me to go back. It was too late. I had\nbarely time to get free of the stirrups when we were into it,--the two\nof us and the horse. It isn't more than three or four feet deep, as you\nknow, but I knew it meant death if we went into the mill tail below. I\nlost my grip and was gone when he grappled me. I don't know yet how he\ncame to save my life and lose his own.\"\n\n\"It was to be,\" says Jeffard, brokenly. \"When I reached you he was\nholding you up with one hand and clinging to the bridge stringer with\nthe other. His weight and yours with the rush of the water had pushed\nthe timber down, and his head was under.\"\n\nTwo other turns they make, and then Jeffard says, with awe in his\nvoice, \"He knew about it beforehand, Denby,\" and he tells Lansdale's\ndream.\n\nDenby hears him through without interrupting, but at the end of it he\nsays, gently: \"It wasn't a dream. Higgins was overdue with the team\nfrom Aspen, and I went out to see what had become of him. I passed here\non my way up the trail about nine o'clock, and you were both asleep\nthen. I had crossed by the lower ford and found it pretty bad, so I\nturned back from here and rode down to see if the bridge was all right.\nHe saw me and heard me.\"\n\nJeffard's gesture is of unconvincement.\n\n\"That accounts for part of it,\" he says; \"but I shall always believe he\nforesaw his death and the manner of it.\"\n\nAfter that they pace up and down in silence again, treading out the\nsorrowful watch until daylight is fully come, bringing with it a team\nfrom the mine and men to do what remains to be done. The two stand\napart until the men have done their office, falling in to walk softly\nbehind the wagon on the short journey down the valley to the mine\nsettlement. On the way, Jeffard accounts for himself briefly.\n\n\"He was one of the two best friends I had in the world,\" he says. \"I\nhad him out on a camping holiday for his health, and he was gaining\nday by day. We were counting upon dropping in on you this morning, and\nnow\"--\n\n\"I know,\" says the master. \"He gave his life for mine, and it gets\npretty near to me, too.\" And thereafter they keep step with heads bowed\nand eyes downcast, as those in whom sorrow has murdered speech; and the\nbellowing stream at the trail-side thunders a requiem for its victim.\n\nThe setting sun is crimsoning the eastern snow caps while they are\nburying him on the plateau above the mine settlement. An hour later,\nthe master of men and the master of the mine are met together in the\nlog cabin opposite the great gray dump; in the cabin builded by Garvin,\nbut which now serves as the office of the superintendent of the Midas.\nSorrow still sits between, and Denby would give place to it.\n\n\"Put it off till to-morrow, Jeffard,\" he says. \"Neither of us is fit to\ntalk business to-night.\"\n\n\"No, it mustn't be put off. I gave him my promise, and I mean to make\nit good while time serves. Have you any one here who is competent to\nwitness a legal document?\"\n\n\"Yes; Halsey is a notary public.\"\n\n\"Good. Sit down at that desk and draw up a writing transferring my\ninterest in the Midas to Stephen Elliott and Richard Bartrow, trustees.\"\n\n\"What's that? Trustees for whom?\"\n\n\"For James Garvin.\"\n\nThe master of men leans back in his chair, his eyes narrowing and the\nlittle frown of perplexity radiating fan-like above them.\n\n\"Jeffard, do you mean to say that you are going to step aside in favor\nof the man who tried to kill you?\"\n\n\"You may put it that way, if you choose. It would have been done long\nago if I had been able to find the man.\"\n\n\"And you stepped into the breach a year ago and secured his property\nfor him because he had put himself out of the running and couldn't?\nYou've touched me on the raw, Jeffard. It's my business to size people\nup, and you have fairly outflanked me. A blind man might have seen the\ndrift of it, but I didn't; I thought you had robbed him. Why didn't you\ngive it a name?\"\n\n\"I had no thought of concealment until you warned me. Garvin was a\ncriminal in the eye of the law, and the least I could do for him was to\nturn the tide of public opinion in his favor.\"\n\n\"Well, you did it; but just the same, you might have passed the word to\nme. It wouldn't have gone any farther, and I should have felt a good\nbit easier in my mind.\"\n\n\"Perhaps; but you will pardon me if I say that I wasn't considering you\nin the matter. I knew better than to defeat my own end. If I had told\nyou the truth at the time, you would not have believed it; you would\nhave struck hands with your own theory that Garvin had attempted to\nrob me, and you would have talked and acted accordingly.\"\n\n\"What makes you say I wouldn't have believed the truth?\"\n\n\"It would have been merely a declaration of intention at the time, and\nyou would have said that it didn't square with human nature as you know\nit. Bartrow knew, and he went over to the majority. But that is neither\nhere nor there. Will you draw up the writing?\"\n\nDenby goes to the desk and writes out the transfer, following Jeffard's\ndictation. When it is signed and acknowledged, Jeffard slips his final\nanchor.\n\n\"I presume you will want to make a new operating contract with the\ntrustees, or with Garvin, and in that case you will want to cancel the\nold one. I haven't my copy of it with me, but I'll mail it to you when\nI get back to Denver.\"\n\nDenby is making a pretense of rummaging in the pigeonholes of the\ndesk to cover a small struggle which has nothing to do with the\nsuperintendent's files. When the struggle is fought to a finish, he\nturns suddenly and holds out his hand.\n\n\"Jeffard, that night when we wrangled it out up yonder on the old dump\nI said some things that I shouldn't have said if you had seen fit to be\na little franker with me. Will you forget them?\"\n\nJeffard takes the proffered hand and wrings it gratefully. \"Thank you\nfor that, Denby,\" he says; \"it's timely. I feel as if I'd like to drop\nout and turn up on some other planet. This thing has cost me pretty\ndear, one way with another.\"\n\n\"It'll come out all right in the end,\" asserts the master; and then:\n\"But you mustn't forget that the cost of it is partly of your own\nincurring. It's a rare failing, but there is such a thing as being too\nclose-mouthed. You've made out your case, after a fashion, and I'm not\ngoing to appeal it; but your postulate was wrong. Human nature is not\nas incredulous of good intentions as the cynics would make it out to\nbe. You might have told a few of us without imperilling Garvin.\"\n\n\"I meant to do it; as I say, I did tell Bartrow that morning when I\nraced Garvin across the range and into Aspen. But he and every one\nelse drew the other conclusion, and I was too stubborn to plead my own\ncause. The stubbornness became a mania with me after a time, and I had\na fit of it no longer ago than last night. I let Lansdale die believing\nthat he had argued me into promising to make restitution. We were\ncoming down here to-day to set the thing in train, and, of course, he\nwould have learned the whole truth; but for one night--\"\n\n\"For one night you would let him have the comfort of believing that he\nhad brought it about,\" says Denby, quickly. \"That wasn't what you were\ngoing to say, but it's the truth, and you know it. I know the feel of\nit; you've reached the point where you can get some sort of comfort out\nof holding your finger in the fire. Suppose you begin right here and\nnow to take a little saner view of things. What are your plans?\"\n\n\"I haven't any.\"\n\n\"Are you open to an offer?\"\n\n\"From you?--yes.\"\n\n\"Good. I'm unlucky enough to have some mining property in Mexico, and\nI've got to go down there and set it in order, or send some one to do\nit for me. Will you go?\"\n\nJeffard's reply is promptly acquiescent.\n\n\"Gladly; if you think I am competent.\"\n\n\"I don't think,--I know. Can you start at short notice?\"\n\n\"The sooner the better. I said I should like to drop out and turn up on\nsome other planet: that will be the next thing to it.\"\n\nFrom that the talk goes overland to the affairs of a century-old silver\nmine in the Chihuahuan mountains, and at the end of it Jeffard knows\nwhat is to be done and how he is to go about the doing of it. Denby\nyawns and looks at his watch.\n\n\"It's bedtime,\" he says. \"Shall we consider it settled and go over to\nthe bunk-shack?\"\n\n\"I have a letter to write,\" says Jeffard. \"Don't wait for me.\"\n\n\"All right. You'll find what you need in the desk,--top drawer on the\nright. Come over when you get ready,\" and the promoter leaves his late\nowner in possession of the superintendent's office.\n\nJudging from the number of false starts and torn sheets, the writing of\nthe letter proves to be no easy matter; but it is begun, continued,\nand ended at length, and Jeffard sits back to read it over.\n\n    \"MY DEAR BARTROW:\n\n    \"When this reaches you, you will have had my telegram of\n    to-day telling you all there is to tell about Lansdale's\n    death. You must forgive me if I don't repeat myself here. It\n    is too new a wound--and too deep--to bear probing, even with\n    a pen.\n\n    \"What I have to say in this letter will probably surprise\n    you. Last night, in our last talk together, Lansdale told\n    me that you know Garvin's whereabouts. Acting upon that\n    information, I have to-night executed a transfer of the\n    Midas to yourself and Stephen Elliott, trustees for Garvin.\n    By agreement with Denby, I cancel my working contract with\n    him, and you, or Garvin, can make another for the unexpired\n    portion of the year on the same terms,--which is Denby's\n    due. You will find the accrued earnings of the mine from\n    the day of my first settlement with Denby deposited in the\n    Denver bank in an account which I opened some months ago\n    in the names of yourself and Elliott, trustees. Out of the\n    earnings I have withheld my wages as a workman in the mine\n    last winter, and a moderate charge for caretaking since.\n\n    \"That is all I have to say, I think, unless I add that\n    you are partly responsible for the delay in Garvin's\n    reinstatement. If you had trusted me sufficiently to tell me\n    what you told Lansdale, it would have saved time and money,\n    inasmuch as I have spared neither in the effort to trace\n    Garvin. I told you the truth that morning in Leadville, but\n    it seems that your loyalty wasn't quite equal to the strain\n    put upon it by public rumor. I don't blame you greatly. I\n    know I had done what a man may to forfeit the respect of his\n    friends. But I made the mistake of taking it for granted\n    that you and Lansdale, and possibly one other, would still\n    give me credit for common honesty, and when I found that you\n    didn't it made me bitter, and I'll be frank enough to say\n    that I haven't gotten over it yet.\"\n\nThe letter pauses with the little outflash of resentment, and he takes\nthe pen to sign it. But in the act he adds another paragraph.\n\n    \"That is putting it rather harshly, and just now I'm not\n    in the mood to quarrel with any one; and least of all with\n    you. I am going away to be gone indefinitely, and I don't\n    want to give you a buffet by way of leave-taking. But the\n    fact remains. If you can admit it and still believe that the\n    old-time friendship is yet alive in me, I wish you would.\n    And if you dare take word from me to Miss Elliott, I'd be\n    glad if you would say to her that my sorrow for what has\n    happened is second only to hers.\"\n\nThe letter is signed, sealed, and addressed, and he drops it into the\nmail-box. The lamp is flaring in the night wind sifting in through\nthe loosened chinking, and he extinguishes it and goes out to tramp\nhimself weary in the little cleared space which had once been Garvin's\ndooryard. It is a year and a day since he wore out the midwatch of that\nother summer night on the eve of the forthfaring from the valley of dry\nbones, and he recalls it and the impassioned outburst which went to the\nending of it. Again he turns his face toward the far-away city of the\nplain, but this time his eyes are dim when the reiterant thought slips\ninto speech. \"God help me!\" he says. \"How can I ever go to her and tell\nher that I have failed!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\n\nTHE news of Lansdale's death came with the shock of the unexpected\nto the dwellers in the metamorphosed cabin on the upslope of Topeka\nMountain, albeit no one of the three of them had ventured to hope for\nanything more than a reprieve as the outcome of the jaunt afield. But\nthe manner of his death at the time when the reprieve seemed well\nassured was responsible for the shock and its sorrowful aftermath; and\nif Constance grieved more than Bartrow or her cousin, it was only for\nthe reason that the heart of compassion knows best the bitterness of\ninfruition.\n\n\"It's a miserably comfortless saying to offer you, Connie, dear, but we\nmust try to believe it is for the best,\" said Myra, finding Constance\nre-reading Jeffard's telegram by the light of her bedroom lamp.\n\nConstance put her arms about her cousin's neck, and the heart of\ncompassion overflowed. \"'For unto every one that hath shall be given,\nbut from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he\nhath,'\" she sobbed. \"Of all the things he had set his heart upon life\nwas the least,--was only the means to an end: and even that was taken\nfrom him.\"\n\n\"No, not taken, Connie; he gave it, and gave it freely. He did for\nanother what his friend was trying to do for him.\"\n\nAt the reference to Jeffard, Constance went to stand before the\ncrackling fire of fir-splinters on the hearth. After a time she said:\n\"Do you suppose Mr. Jeffard will come here to tell us about it?\"\n\nMyra's answer was a query.\n\n\"Does he know you are here?\"\n\n\"No, I think not.\"\n\n\"Then he will be more likely to go to Denver.\"\n\nConnie's gaze was in the fire, and she swerved aside from the straight\npath of inference.\n\n\"He will write to Dick,\" she said. \"I should like to read the letter\nwhen it comes, if I may.\"\n\nMyra promised, and so it rested; but when Jeffard's letter came, and\nBartrow had shared its astounding news with his wife, Myra was for\nrescinding her promise.\n\n\"I don't know why she shouldn't read it,\" said Dick. \"She has always\nbeen more or less interested in him, and it will do her a whole lot of\ngood to know that we were all off wrong. Jeffard's little slap at me\nhits her, too, but she won't mind that.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Myra; \"I was thinking of something else,--something quite\ndifferent.\"\n\n\"Is it sayable?\"\n\nThey were sitting on the steps of the extended porch. The night-shift\nwas at work in the Myriad below, and the rattle and clank of a dump-car\ncoming out postponed her answer. When the clangor subsided she glanced\nover her shoulder.\n\n\"She can't hear,\" said Bartrow. \"She's in the sitting-room reading to\nUncle Steve.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure that it is sayable, Dick. But for the last two days I've\nbeen wondering if we weren't mistaken about something else, too,--about\nConnie's feeling for Mr. Lansdale. She is sorry, but not quite in the\nway I expected she would be.\"\n\n\"What has that got to do with Jeffard's letter?\" demanded the downright\none. His transplantings of perspicacity were not yet sufficiently\nacclimated to bloom out of season.\n\n\"Nothing, perhaps.\" She gave it up as unspeakable, and went to the\ndetails of the business affair. \"Shall you tell Garvin at once?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"How fortunate it is that he and Uncle Stephen came in to-day.\"\n\n\"Yes. They were staked for another month, and I didn't look for them\nuntil they were driven in for more grub. But Garvin says the old man is\nabout played out. He's too old. He can't stand the pick and shovel in\nthis altitude at his age. We'll have to talk him out of it and run him\nback to Denver some way or other.\"\n\n\"Can't you make this trusteeship an excuse? If Garvin needed a guardian\nat first, he will doubtless need one now.\"\n\nBartrow nodded thoughtfully. Another car was coming out, and he waited\nuntil the crash of the falling ore had come and gone.\n\n\"Jeffard knew what he was about all the time; knew it when he wrote\nthis letter just as well as he did when he shouldered the curse of it\nto keep a possible lynching party from hanging Garvin. That's why he\nput it in trust. He knew Garvin had gone daft and thrown it away once,\nand he was afraid he might do it again.\"\n\n\"Will he?\" asked the wife.\n\n\"I guess not. I believe he has learned his lesson. More than that,\nJim's as soft as mush on the side next the old man. If I can make out\nto tie Uncle Steve's welfare up in the deal, Garvin will come to the\nfront like a man.\"\n\n\"Where is Garvin now?\"\n\n\"He is down at the bunk-house.\"\n\nMyra rose. \"I suppose you want to get it over with. Let me have the\nletter, if you won't need it.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"Carry Connie off to her room and keep her busy with this while you\nand Uncle Stephen fight it out with the new millionaire,\" she said. \"I\ndon't envy you your part of it.\"\n\nBartrow laughed, and the transplantings put forth a late shoot.\n\n\"Come to think of it, I don't know as I envy you yours,\" he retorted.\n\"She's all broke up about Uncle Steve's health and Lansdale's death\nnow, and she'll have a fit when she finds out how she has been piling\nit on to Jeffard when he didn't deserve it.\"\n\nIt was an hour later, and the day-men smoking on the porch of the\nboarding-house had gone to bed, when the husband and wife met again\nmidway of the path leading up from the shaft-house of the Myriad to\nthe metamorphosed cabin. Bartrow had walked down to the boarding-house\nwith Garvin, and Myra's impatience had sent her down the path to meet\nhim. Dick gave her his arm up the steep ascent, and drew her to a seat\non the lowest of the porch steps.\n\n\"Where is Connie?\" he inquired, anticipating an avalanche of questions,\nout of which he would have to dig his way without fear of interruption.\n\n\"She is with her father. Begin at the beginning, and tell me all about\nit. What did Garvin say? Is he going to be sensible?\"\n\n\"There isn't so much to tell as there might be,\" Dick said, smothering\na mighty prompting to tell the major fact first. \"Garvin took it very\nsensibly, though a body could see that the lamplight was a good bit too\nstrong for his eyes. He had to try three or four times before he could\nspeak, and then all he could say was 'Thirds, Steve, thirds.'\"\n\n\"'Thirds?' What did he mean by that?\"\n\nBartrow hesitated for a moment, as a gunner who would make sure of the\npriming before he jerks the lanyard.\n\n\"Did it ever occur to you that any one else besides Garvin and Jeffard\nmight be interested in the Midas?\"\n\n\"Why, no!\"\n\n\"It didn't to me. I don't know why, but I never thought of it, though I\nknew well enough that Jim never in all his life went prospecting on a\ngrub-stake of his own providing. He didn't that summer three years ago\nwhen he drove the tunnel on the Midas.\"\n\nMyra's lips were dry, and she had to moisten them to say, \"Who was it,\nDick?\"\n\n\"Who should it be but our good old Uncle Steve? Of course, he'd\nforgotten all about it, and there he stood, wringing Garvin's hand and\ntrying to congratulate him; and Jim hanging on to the back of his chair\nand saying, 'Thirds, Steve, I say thirds.' Garvin made him understand\nat last, and then the old man melted down into his chair and put his\nface in his hands. When he took it out again it was to look up and say,\n'You're right, Jim; of course it's thirds,' and then he asked me where\nJeffard was.\"\n\nMyra's voice was unsteady, but she made shift to say what there was to\nbe said; and Bartrow went on.\n\n\"After a bit we got down to business and straightened things out.\nA third interest in the Midas is to be set apart for Jeffard, to\nbe rammed down his throat when we find him, whether he will or no.\nUncle Steve will go back to Denver and set up housekeeping again; and\nGarvin,--but that's the funny part of the whole shooting-match. Garvin\nrefuses to touch a dollar of the money as owner; insists on leaving it\nin trust, just as it is now; and made me sit down there and then and\nwrite his will.\"\n\nAn outcoming car of ore drowned Myra's exclamation of surprise.\n\n\"Fact,\" said Bartrow. \"He reserves an income to be paid to him at Uncle\nSteve's discretion and mine, and at his death his third goes,--to whom,\ndo you suppose?\"\n\n\"Indeed, I can't imagine,--unless it is to Connie.\"\n\n\"Not much! It's to be held in trust for Margaret Gannon's children.\"\n\n\"For Margaret,--why, she hasn't any children! And besides, he doesn't\nknow her!\"\n\n\"Don't you fool yourself. He knows she hasn't any children, but\nhe's living in hopes. I told you there was something between them\nfrom the way Garvin turned in and nursed the old blacksmith before\nMargaret came. You wouldn't believe it, because they both played the\ntotal-stranger act; but that was one time when I got ahead of you,\nwasn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes; go on.\"\n\n\"Well, I made out the will, 'I, James Garvin, being of sound mind,' and\nso on; and Uncle Steve and I witnessed it. But on the way down to the\nbunk-shanty just now I pinned Garvin up against the wall and made him\ntell me why. He knew Margaret when she was in the Bijou, and asked her\nto marry him. She was honest enough even then to refuse him. It made me\nwant to weep when I remembered how she had been mixed up with Jeffard.\"\n\nMyra was silent for a full minute, and when she spoke it was out of the\ndepths of a contrite heart.\n\n\"I made you believe that, Dick, against your will; and you were right,\nafter all. Mr. Jeffard was only trying to help Connie's poor people\nthrough Margaret, though why he should do that when he was withholding\na fortune from Uncle Stephen is still a mystery.\"\n\n\"That is as simple as twice two,\" said the husband. \"Didn't I tell you?\nGarvin had no occasion to tell him who his grub-staker was in the first\nplace, and no chance to do it afterward. Jeffard didn't know,--doesn't\nknow yet.\"\n\nMyra went silent again, this time for more than a minute.\n\n\"I have learned something, too, Dick; but I am not sure that I ought to\ntell it,\" she said, after the interval.\n\n\"I can wait,\" said Bartrow cheerfully. \"I've had a full meal of\ndouble-back-action surprises as it is.\"\n\n\"This isn't a surprise; or it wouldn't be if we hadn't been taking too\nmuch for granted. I tolled Connie off to her room with the letter, as I\nsaid I would; and she--she had a fit, as you prophesied.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" says Dick. \"It hurts her more than anything to make a\nmiscue on the charitable side.\"\n\n\"Yes, but\"--\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you sometime, Dick, but not now. It is too pitiful.\"\n\n\"I can wait,\" said Bartrow again; and his lack of curiosity drove her\ninto the thick of it.\n\n\"If you knew you'd want to do something,--as I do, only I don't know\nhow. Isn't it pretty clear that Mr. Jeffard cares a great deal for\nConnie?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know about that. What makes you think so?\" says the\nobvious one.\n\n\"A good many little things; some word or two that Margaret has let\nslip, for one of them. How otherwise would you explain his eagerness to\nhelp Connie?\"\n\n\"On general principles, I guess. She's plenty good enough to warrant\nit.\"\n\n\"Yes, but it wasn't 'general principles' in Mr. Jeffard's case. He is\nin love with Connie, and\"--\n\n\"And she doesn't care for him. Is that it?\"\n\n\"No, it isn't it; she does care for him. I fairly shocked it out of her\nwith the letter, and that is why I oughtn't to tell it, even to you. It\nis too pitiful!\"\n\nBartrow shook his head in cheerful density. \"Your philosophy's too deep\nfor me. If they are both of one mind, as you say, I don't see where the\npity comes in. Jeffard isn't half good enough for her, of course; he\nmade a bally idiot of himself a year ago. But if she can forget that,\nI'm sure we ought to.\"\n\n\"I wasn't thinking of that. But don't you see how impossible this Midas\ntangle makes it? He won't take his third, you may be very sure of that;\nand when he finds out that Connie has a daughter's share in one of the\nother thirds, it will seal his lips for all time. People would say that\nhe gave up his share only to marry hers.\"\n\nBartrow got upon his feet and helped her to rise. \"You'll take cold\nsitting out here in the ten-thousand-foot night,\" he said; and on the\ntop step of the porch-flight she had his refutation of her latest\nassertion.\n\n\"You say people would talk. Doesn't it strike you that Jeffard is the\none man in a thousand who will mount and ride regardless?--who will\nsmile and snap his fingers at public opinion? That's just what he's\nbeen doing all along, and he'll do it again if he feels like it. Let's\ngo in and congratulate the good old uncle while we wait.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\n\nTHE day train from the south ran into the early winter twilight at\nAcequia, and into the night at Littleton; and the arc stars of the\ncity, resplendent with frosty aureoles, were brightly scintillant when\nJeffard gave his hand-bag to the porter and passed out through the gate\nat the Union Depot. By telegraphic prearrangement, he was to meet Denby\nin Denver to make his report upon the Chihuahuan silver mine; but when\nhe made inquiry at the hotel he was not sorry to find that the promoter\nhad not yet arrived. It is a far cry from Santa Rosalia to Denver; as\nfar as from the beginning of the seventeenth century to the end of the\nnineteenth; and he was grateful for a little breathing space in which\nto synchronize himself.\n\nBut after dinner, and a cigar burned frugally in the great rotunda,\nwhere the faces of all the comers and goers were unfamiliar, the\nhomesickness of the returned exile came upon him, and he went out\nto grapple with it in the open air. Faring absently from street to\nstreet, with his hands thrust into his overcoat pockets and memory\nplowing its furrow deep in a field which had lain fallow through many\ntoil-filled weeks, he presently found himself drifting by squares and\nstreet-crossings toward Capitol Hill, and out and beyond to a broad\navenue and past a house with a veranda in front and a deep-bayed window\nat the side. There were lights in the house, and an air of owner's\noccupancy about the place; and on the veranda a big man was tramping\nsolidly up and down, with the red spark at the end of his cigar\nappearing and disappearing as he passed and repassed the windows.\n\nJeffard saw the man and saw him not. The memory-plow had gone deeper,\nand the winter night changed places with a June morning, with the sun\nshining aslant on the wide veranda, and a young woman in a belted\nhouse-gown with loose sleeves tiptoeing on the arm of a clumsy chair\nwhile she caught up the new growth of a climbing rose. Just here the\nplow began to tear up rootlets well-buried but still sensitive; and\nJeffard turned about abruptly and set his face cityward.\n\nBut once again in the region of tall buildings and peopled sidewalks,\nthe thought of the crowded lobby and the loneliness of it assailed him\nafresh, and he changed his course again, being careful to go at right\nangles to the broad avenue with its house of recollection. A little way\nbeyond the peopled walks the church bells began to ring out clear and\nmelodious on the frosty air, and he remembered what the uncalendared\njourney had made him forget; that it was Sunday. Pacing thoughtfully,\nwith the transit-hum of the city behind him and the quiet house-streets\nahead, and the plow still shearing the sod of the fallow field, he\nwondered if Constance Elliott would be among the churchgoers. It was\nan upflash of the old cynicism which prompted the retort that it was\nimprobable; that the Christianity for which she stood was not found in\nthe churches. But the Puritan blood in him rose up in protest at that,\nand in the rebound the open doors of a church on the opposite side of\nthe way beckoned him.\n\nHe crossed the street and entered. The organist was playing the\nvoluntary, and a smart young man with a tuberose in his buttonhole held\nup the finger of invitation.\n\n\"Not too far forward,\" Jeffard whispered; but the young man seemed not\nto have heard, since he led the way up the broad centre aisle to a pew\nfar beyond the strangers' precinct.\n\nThe pew was unoccupied, and Jeffard went deep into it, meaning to\nbe well out of the way of later comers. But when the finale of the\nvoluntary merged by harmonious transpositions into the key of the\nopening hymn, the other sittings in the pew were still untaken, and\nJeffard congratulated himself. There be times when partial isolation,\neven in a sparsely filled church, is grateful; and the furrows in the\nfallow field were still smoking from their recent upturning.\n\nJeffard stood in the hymn-singing, and bowed his head at the prayer,\nnot so much in reverence as in deference to time, place, and\nencompassments. Since the shearing of the plowshare filled his ears,\nthe words of the beseeching were lost to him, but he was sufficiently\nalive to his surroundings to know that the pew filled quietly at the\nbeginning of the prayer; and sufficiently reserved afterward to deny\nhimself so much as a glance aside at his nearest neighbor.\n\nHow long he would have sat staring abstractedly at the pictured window\nbeyond the choir must remain a matter for conjecture. The minister had\ngiven out the psalm, and Jeffard stood up with the others. Whereupon\nhe saw of necessity that his neighbor was a woman, so small that the\ntrimmings on her modest walking hat came barely to his shoulder; saw\nthis, and a moment later was looking down into a pair of steadfast gray\neyes, deep-welled and eloquent, as she handed him an open book with the\nleaf turned down.\n\nHe took the book mechanically, with mute thanks, but afterward he saw\nand heard nothing for which the evensong in St. Cyril's-in-the-Desert\ncould justly be held responsible, being lifted to a seventh heaven of\necstasy far more real than that depicted in the glowing periods of\nthe preacher. He made the most of it, knowing that it would presently\nvanish, and that he should have to come to earth again. And not by\nwhispered word or sign of recognition would he mar the beatitude of it.\nOnly once, when he put aside the book she had given him and looked on\nwith her, did he suffer himself to do more than to enjoy silently and\nto the full the sweet pleasure of her nearness.\n\nUnder the circumstances it was not singular that his by-glancings\ndid not go beyond her; and that Dick Bartrow's hearty handclasp and\nstage-whisper greeting at the close of the service should take him\nby surprise. This he endured as one in a dream; also the introduction\nto a radiant young woman with whom Bartrow presently led the way into\nthe stream of decorously jostling outgoers pouring down the great\naisle. That left Jeffard to follow with the small one; and he was still\ngroping his way through the speechless ravishment of it when they\novertook the Bartrows on the sidewalk. Dick promptly broke the spell.\n\n\"Well, well!\" he began. \"Nothing surprises me any more; otherwise I\nshould say you are about the last man on top of earth that I'd expect\nto run up against in church. Don't say 'same here,' because I do go\nwhen I'm made to. Where in the forty-five states and odd territories\ndid you drop from?\"\n\n\"Not from any one of them,\" laughed Jeffard; and Myra remarked that\nConnie's hand was still on his arm. \"I am just up from Old Mexico.\"\n\n\"And you made a straight shoot for a church--for our church and our\npew. Good boy! You knew right where to find us on a Sunday evening,\ndidn't you?\"\n\nJeffard laughed again. Since a time unremembered of him it had not been\nso easy to laugh and be glad.\n\n\"Don't believe him, Mrs. Bartrow,\" he protested. \"My motive was a\nlittle mixed, I'll confess, but it was altogether better than that. I\nwas passing, and it occurred to me that I hadn't seen the inside of an\nAmerican church for a long time.\"\n\n\"Or of any other kind, I'll be bound,\" Bartrow amended; and then, in\na spirit of sheer ruthlessness: \"Why don't you say something, Connie?\nCall him down and make him tell the truth about it.\"\n\n\"You don't give any one a chance to say anything,\" retorts the quiet\none, with a summer-lightning flash of the old mock-antagonism. And then\nto Jeffard: \"We are all very glad to see you again, Mr. Jeffard. Will\nyou be in town long?\"\n\nBartrow took the words out of his mouth and made answer for him.\n\n\"Of course he will; he is going to settle down and be\nhome-folks--aren't you, Jeffard? Fall in and let's walk to where we\ncan wrestle it out without freezing. It's colder than ordinary charity\nstanding here.\"\n\nNow the way to his hotel lay behind him and Jeffard hesitated.\nWhereupon Bartrow turned with a laugh derisive.\n\n\"Come on, you two. Have you forgotten the formula, Jeffard? I'll prompt\nyou, and you can say it over after me. 'Miss Elliott, may I have the\npleasure of seeing you'--\"\n\nMyra pounced upon the mocker and dragged him away; and Constance cut in\nswiftly.\n\n\"You mustn't mind what Dick says. He calls going to church\n'dissipation,' and he is never quite responsible afterward. Won't you\ngo home with us, Mr. Jeffard?\"\n\nJeffard murmured something about a hotel and an appointment, but he\nhad been waiting only for an intimation that he was forgiven. So they\nwent on together, walking briskly, as the frosty night demanded, but\nthey were not able to overtake the twain in advance. For a time they\nwere both tongue-tied, and for a wonder it was the man who first rose\nsuperior to the entanglements of memory. But he was careful to choose\nthe safest of commonplaces for a topic. They were ascending Capitol\nHill, and by way of a beginning he said, \"Are you living in this part\nof the city now?\"\n\n\"Yes; in the old place on Colfax. Dick ran across the owner in\nCalifornia last autumn and bought it.\"\n\n\"It is a very pleasant place,\" Jeffard ventured, still determined to\nkeep on ground of the safest.\n\n\"Do you know it?\" she said, quickly.\n\n\"Oh, yes;--er--that is, I know where it is. I passed it one morning a\nlong time ago.\"\n\n\"While we were living there?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nSilence again for one entire square and part of another. Then she said,\n\"How did you know it was our house?\"\n\nHe laid hold of his courage and told the truth. \"I met your father a\nblock or two down the avenue and I was hoping I might come upon the\nplace where you lived. I found it. You were on the veranda, tying up\nthe new shoots of a climbing rose.\"\n\n\"My 'Marechal Niel,'\" she said. \"It is dead now; they let it freeze\nlast winter.\"\n\nHe held his peace for a time, but the rejoinder strove for speech, and\nhad it, finally.\n\n\"The memory of it lives,\" he said. \"I shall always see you as I saw you\nthat morning, whatever comes between. You had on some sort of a dress\nthat reminded me of the old Greek draperies, and you were standing on\nthe arm of a big chair.\"\n\nThey were at the gate, and she let him open it for her. Bartrow and\nMyra were waiting for them at the veranda step. He realized that the\nground was no longer safe, and would have taken his leave at the door.\nBut Dick protested vigorously.\n\n\"No, you don't--drop out again like a ship in a fog. We've been laying\nfor you, Uncle Steve and I, ever since you absconded last summer, and\nyou don't get away this time without taking your medicine. Run him in\nthere, Connie, and hang on to him while I go get my slippers and a\ncigar.\"\n\n\"There\" was the cozy library, with a soft-coal fire burning cheerily\nin the grate, and the book-lined walls inviting enough to beckon\nany homeless one. But Jeffard was far beyond any outreaching of\nencompassments inviting or repellent. Constance drew up a chair for him\nbefore the fire, but he stood at the back of it and looked down upon\nher.\n\n\"Miss Elliott, there is something that I should like to tell you\nabout--if it is far enough in the past,\" he said, when they were alone.\n\nShe was sitting with clasped hands, and there was a look in her eyes in\nthe swift upglancing that he could not fathom. So he waited for her to\ngive him leave.\n\n\"Is it about Mr. Lansdale?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes. I was with him up to the last, and I thought that--that you might\nlike to know what I can tell you.\"\n\nShe gave him liberty, and he told the story of the jaunt afield,\ndwelling chiefly on the day-to-day improvement in Lansdale's health,\nand stumbling a little when he came to speak of their last evening\ntogether.\n\n\"It was a hard blow for me,\" he said, at the end of it, and his voice\nwas low and unsteady with emotion. \"You know what had gone before--what\nI had lost and couldn't regain; and having failed at all points I had\nhoped to succeed in this: to bring him back to you sound and well. And\nwhen the possibility was fairly within reach it was taken out of my\nhands forever.\"\n\nShe was silent for a little time, fighting a sharp battle with\nreticence new-born and masterful. When she spoke it was as one who is\nconstrained to walk with bare feet in a thorny path of frankness.\n\n\"To bring him back to me, you say; and in your letter to Dick you said\nthat your sorrow was second only to mine. Was he not your friend, as\nwell as mine?\"\n\n\"I loved him,\" said Jeffard, simply; \"but not as you did.\"\n\nAgain the struggle was upon her, and for a moment she thought that the\nsound of Dick's returning footsteps would be the signal of a blessed\nrelease. But the heart of sincerity would not be denied.\n\n\"Let there be no more misunderstandings,\" she said, bravely. \"We have\nall wronged you so deeply that you have a right to know the truth. Mr.\nLansdale was my friend--as he was yours.\"\n\n\"But he meant to be more,\" Jeffard persisted--\"and if he had come back\nwith the courage of health to help him say it, you would not have\ndenied him.\"\n\nShe made a little gesture of dissent.\n\n\"His health had nothing to do with it. And--and he said it before he\nwent away.\"\n\nJeffard smiled. \"You have halved the bitterness of it for me--as you\nwould have lessened my reward if I had succeeded in bringing him back\nalive and well. My motive was mixed, as most human promptings are,--I\ncan see that now,--but the better part of it was a desire to prove to\nyou that I could do it for your sake. My debt to you is so large that\nnothing short of self-effacement can ever discharge it.\"\n\n\"How can you say that!\" she burst out. \"Wasn't I one of the three who\nought to have believed in you?--the one who promised and failed and\nmade it harder for you at every turn? You owe me nothing but scorn.\"\n\nHe contradicted her gravely. \"I owe you everything that has been saved\nout of the wreck of the man who once sat beside you in the theatre and\nfound fault with the world for his own shortcomings. You are remorseful\nnow because you think you misjudged me; but you must believe me when I\ntell you that it was my love for you that saved me, at the end of the\nends,--that kept me from doing precisely what you thought I had done.\nIt was a fearful temptation. Garvin had fairly tossed the thing into\nthe abyss.\"\n\n\"I know; but it was only a temptation, and you did not yield to it.\"\n\n\"No; I was able to put it aside in the strength born of four words of\nyours. At a time when I had forgotten God and so was willing to think\nthat He had forgotten me, you said 'I believe in you.' You remember it?\"\n\nShe nodded assent, looking up with shining eyes to say, \"Don't make me\nashamed that I hadn't the strength to go on believing in you.\"\n\n\"Don't say that. You have nothing to regret. My silence was the price\nof Garvin's safety, at first, and I knew what the cost would be when\nI determined to pay it. Later on the fault was mine; but then I found\nthat I had unconsciously been counting upon blind loyalty; yours, and\nDick's, and Lansdale's;--counting upon it after I had done everything\nto make it impossible. I had told Dick in the beginning, and I tried to\ntell Lansdale. Dick wanted to believe in me,--has wanted to all along,\nI think,--but Lansdale had drawn his own conclusions, and he made my\nexplanation fit them. It hurt, and I gave place to bitterness.\"\n\n\"And yet you would have saved him for--for--\"\n\n\"For that which I couldn't have myself. Yes; but you know the motive.\"\n\nShe met his gaze with a new light shining in the steadfast eyes. \"I am\nnot worthy,\" she said, softly; and he went quickly to stand beside her.\n\n\"You are worthy; worthy of the best that any man can give you,\nConstance. How little I have to offer you, beyond a love that was\nstrong enough to stand aside for the sake of your happiness, you know.\nEver since that afternoon when you strove with me for my own soul I've\nbeen living on your compassion, and it is very sweet--but I want more.\nMay I hope to win more--in time?\"\n\nShe shook her head, and his heart stopped beating. But it came alive\nagain with a tumultuous bound at the words of the soft-spoken reply.\n\n\"You won it long ago, so long that I've forgotten when and how. And\nit's strong, too, like yours. I've tried hard enough to starve it, but\nit has lived--lived on nothing.\"\n\nShe was sitting in a low willow rocker, and the distance between them\nwas altogether impossible. So he went down on one knee and put his arms\nabout her; and but for his manhood would have put his face in her bosom\nand wept.\n\n\"Do you really mean that, Constance?\" he said, when he had drunk his\nfill from the deep wells in the loving eyes.\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"In spite of what you believed I had done to Garvin, and of what you\nbelieved I was capable of doing with Margaret?\"\n\n\"In spite of everything. Wasn't it dreadful?\"\n\n\"It was--\" There was no superlative strong enough, though he sought\nfor it painfully and with tears. \"God help me, sweetheart, I believe I\nshall go mad with the joy of it.\" And having said that, speech forsook\nhim, and the silence that is golden came between. After a while she\nbroke it to say:\n\n\"Dick is good, isn't he?--to be so long finding his slippers and the\ncigar.\"\n\n\"Dick is a man and a brother. I wonder if we can persuade him to give\nme a place on the Myriad.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't take it.\"\n\n\"Why wouldn't I?\"\n\n\"Because you own an undivided third of a richer mine than the Little\nMyriad, and--and you are going to marry another third,\" she said, with\nsweet audacity.\n\nThere was a hassock convenient, and he drew it up to sit at her feet.\n\n\"Break it as gently as you can,\" he entreated. \"My cup is too full to\nhold much more. Besides, I've been in Mexico for the last three months,\nand nothing happens there.\"\n\n\"It's the Midas,\" she explained, beginning in the midst. \"You saved it\nfor Garvin, but he was only a half-owner.\"\n\n\"And the other?\"\n\n\"Was my father. When it came to the apportionment they both said\n'thirds,' and that is what poppa and Dick are waiting to say to you\nnow.\"\n\nHe found his feet rather unsteadily.\n\n\"I can't take it,\" he said; \"you know I can't. It would be too much\nlike taking a reward for an act of simple justice. Moreover, I have my\nreward, and it isn't to be spoken of in the same day with any Midas of\nthem all. I'll go and tell them so.\"\n\nShe rose and stood beside him, lifting the loving eyes to his. The soft\nglow of the firelight made a golden aureole of the red-brown hair, and\nthe sweet lips were tremulous.\n\n\"If you must, Henry. But loving-kindness isn't always in giving and\nserving and relinquishing. My father has his ideal of justice, too,\nand so has James Garvin. But for you, they say, the Midas would never\nhave been found, or, having been found, would straightway have been\nlost again. I know the money is nothing to you,--to us two, who have\nso much; but won't you make a little concession, a little sacrifice of\npride,--for their sakes, Henry?\"\n\nHe took her face between his hands and bent to kiss the lips of\npleading.\n\n\"Not for their sakes, nor for all the world beside, my beloved; but\nalways and always for yours. Come; let us go together.\"\n\n\n\n\n    ELECTROTYPED AND PRINTED\n    BY H. O. HOUGHTON AND CO.\n\n    The Riverside Press\n\n    CAMBRIDGE, MASS., U. S.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\nFoundation's web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org\/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":31,"split":"train"}
