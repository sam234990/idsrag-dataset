{"ori_id":"c4e227aa88c6fbc0c021532499db1b30c16f0eaf","title":"The Duchess of Padua","context":"The Duchess of Padua\n The Duchess of Padua tells the story of a young man named Guido who was left in the charge of a man he calls his uncle as a baby. Guido gets a notice to meet a man in Padua in regards to something concerning his parentage. When he arrives in Padua he is convinced by a man named Moranzone to abandon his only friend, Ascanio, in order to dedicate himself to revenging his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death at the hands of Simone Gesso, the Duke of Padua. In the course of the play Guido finds he has fallen in love with Beatrice, the title character, and confides his love to her, a love which she returns. By this time Guido has had a change of heart and decides not to kill the Duke of Padua, and instead intends to leave his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dagger at the Duke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bedside to let the Duke know that his life could have been taken if Guido had wanted to kill him. On the way to the bedchamber, however, Guido is met by Beatrice, who has herself stabbed and killed the Duke so that she might be with Guido. Guido is appalled at the sin committed on his behalf and rejects Beatrice, claiming that their love has been soiled. She runs from him and when she comes across some guards she claims that Guido killed the Duke. He is brought to trial the next day. Beatrice tries to prevent Guido from speaking on his behalf for fear that she might be exposed as the killer, but Guido admits to the killing to protect her, and so the date for his execution is set. Beatrice goes to visit Guido in his cell and tells him that she has confessed to the murder but that the magistrates did not believe her and would not allow her to pardon Guido. Before waking Guido, Beatrice drinks some poison and when Guido discovers that the poison is all but gone, he shares a kiss with Beatrice before she dies, at which time Guido takes her knife and kills himself.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Duchess of Padua, by Oscar Wilde\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most\nother parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions \nwhatsoever.

I warrant\n   he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be glad if we could wake him when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the grave.\n\nTHIRD SOLDIER\n\n   Nay! for when he wakes there it will be judgment day.\n\nSECOND SOLDIER\n\n   Ay, and he has done a grievous thing; for, look you, to murder one of\n   us who are but flesh and blood is a sin, and to kill a Duke goes being\n   near against the law.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER\n\n   Well, well, he was a wicked Duke.\n\nSECOND SOLDIER\n\n   And so he should not have touched him; if one meddles with wicked\n   people, one is like to be tainted with their wickedness.\n\nTHIRD SOLDIER\n\n   Ay, that is true.  How old is the prisoner?\n\nSECOND SOLDIER\n\n   Old enough to do wrong, and not old enough to be wise.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER\n\n   Why, then, he might be any age.\n\nSECOND SOLDIER\n\n   They say the Duchess wanted to pardon him.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER\n\n   Is that so?\n\nSECOND SOLDIER\n\n   Ay, and did much entreat the Lord Justice, but he would not.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER\n\n   I had thought, Pietro, that the Duchess was omnipotent.\n\nSECOND SOLDIER\n\n   True, she is well-favoured; I know none so comely.\n\nTHE SOLDIERS\n\n   Ha! ha! ha!\n\nFIRST SOLDIER\n\n   I meant I had thought our Duchess could do anything.\n\nSECOND SOLDIER\n\n   Nay, for he is now given over to the Justices, and they will see that\n   justice be done; they and stout Hugh the headsman; but when his head\n   is off, why then the Duchess can pardon him if she likes; there is no\n   law against that.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER\n\n   I do not think that stout Hugh, as you call him, will do the business\n   for him after all.  This Guido is of gentle birth, and so by the law\n   can drink poison first, if it so be his pleasure.\n\nTHIRD SOLDIER\n\n   And if he does not drink it?\n\nFIRST SOLDIER\n\n   Why, then, they will kill him.\n\n                                           [_Knocking comes at the door_.]\n\nFIRST SOLDIER\n\n   See who that is.\n\n        [_Third Soldier goes over and looks through the wicket_.]\n\nTHIRD SOLDIER\n\n   It is a woman, sir.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER\n\n   Is she pretty?\n\nTHIRD SOLDIER\n\n   I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell.

Men are afraid of the headsman.\n\nDUCHESS\n\n   Is that poison?\n\nFIRST SOLDIER\n\n   Ay, madam, and very sure poison too.\n\nDUCHESS\n\n   You may go, sir.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER\n\n   By Saint James, a pretty hand!

Why, why should I die?\n   He will escape to-night, and so his blood\n   Will not be on my head.  No, I must die;\n   I have been guilty, therefore I must die;\n   He loves me not, and therefore I must die:\n   I would die happier if he would kiss me,\n   But he will not do that.

Tell me, Guido,\n   Are you not sorry that you ever saw me?\n\nGUIDO\n\n   I swear I would not have lived otherwise.\n   Why, in this dull and common world of ours\n   Men have died looking for such moments as this\n   And have not found them.\n\nDUCHESS\n\n   Then you are not sorry?\n   How strange that seems.\n\nGUIDO\n\n   What, Beatrice, have I not\n   Stood face to face with beauty?  That is enough\n   For one man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life.  Why, love, I could be merry;\n   I have been often sadder at a feast,\n   But who were sad at such a feast as this\n   When Love and Death are both our cup-bearers?\n   We love and die together.\n\nDUCHESS\n\n   Oh, I have been\n   Guilty beyond all women, and indeed\n   Beyond all women punished.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org \n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary \nArchive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\nlocations.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n","id":843,"split":"train"}
