{"ori_id":"599b6ffc75b39b2d8dde708ad37b08dde52fccc0","title":"Water for Elephants (film)","context":"Water for Elephants (film)\n Charlie O'Brien, the proprietor of a small traveling circus, encounters an elderly man, Jacob Jankowski, who is separated from his nursing home group. The two strike up a conversation and Jacob reveals he had a career in the circus business and was present during one of the most infamous circus disasters of all time, the 1944 Hartford circus fire and the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus wreck.\nJankowski tells his story to O'Brien, starting in 1931 when he was a 23-year-old veterinary medicine student at Cornell. During his final exam, he is informed that his parents were killed in a car crash. His father has left huge debts, and the bank was foreclosing on Jacob's home. Feeling there is no point in returning to school, and having no home to go to, he jumps onto a passing train where he meets a man named Camel.\nJacob discovers that he jumped on the Benzini Bros. circus train. He sees a beautiful woman, Marlena Rosenbluth, and meets August, the circus's ringmaster, head animal trainer, and Marlena's husband. Jacob reveals he studied veterinary science and August hires Jacob as a vet for the circus animals after Jacob tells August that Silver has laminitis.\nAugust instructs Jacob to fix Silver and keep him performing as long as possible. But Jacob cannot bear to see Silver's suffering and takes it upon himself to put Silver down. August is furious with Jacob's decision to euthanize Silver against orders. To show Jacob who is boss, he threatens to throw him from the moving train \u00e2\u0080\u0094 telling him that an animal's suffering is nothing compared to a man's, and that Jacob must carry out all of August's future orders if he wishes to keep his job.\nAugust eventually procures Rosie the elephant as Silver's replacement. He invites Jacob to his car for dinner and cocktails with him and Marlena. Jacob watches the married couple flirt and dance in front of him, but it becomes clear that their relationship is complicated because August is possessive, jealous and rough with Marlena.\nIn the next few weeks, August becomes frustrated when Rosie the elephant seems impossible to train. August is brutal with Rosie, beating her when she fails to follow orders. After a beating that August gave to Rosie when she ran away after fleeing from the event and dropping Marlena, Jacob realizes that the elephant only understands Polish commands. After that, Rosie performs beautifully and the circus enjoys a short period of success. While working together to train Rosie, Jacob and Marlena fall in love. After August discovers this, he cruelly taunts the two. Marlena discovers that August plans to throw Jacob from the train and they run away together, hiding in a local hotel. Soon after consummating their relationship, they are ambushed by August's henchmen who drag Marlena away and beat up Jacob.\nJacob returns to the circus to find Marlena. Marlena tells Jacob that his friends Walter and Camel were thrown from the train and killed. Several circus employees have become fed up with August's murderous cruelty and unleash their revenge by unlocking all the animals' cages while the big top tent is jam-packed with an audience enjoying Marlena and Rosie's performance. Jacob attempts to find Marlena in the chaos and August attacks him. When Marlena tries to stop August from beating Jacob, he turns his fury on her and chokes her, while one of August's henchmen beats Jacob. Two circus workers save Jacob and he sees Rosie hit August on the back of the head with a metal spike, killing him.\nHe returned to Cornell and finished his degree. He and Marlena took several of the horses and Rosie and got jobs with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus with he as a veterinarian and she continuing to perform with the animals. They married and had five children and kept Rosie until her death many years later. He took a job as a vet at the Albany Zoo and Marlena died peacefully in her bed at an old age. He convinces O'Brien to hire him in the ticket booth.\n<html>\n<head><title>Water for Elephants Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Water for Elephants script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Water for Elephants script, Water for Elephants movie script, Water for Elephants film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

MENAGERIE TENT - PRESENT DAY - NIGHT\n<\/b>\n          Old Jacob uses his walker to enter the menagerie. He moves to\n          each animal meeting his eyes with theirs. Each animal gives\n          him a look of acknowledgment.\n          He comes to an ORANGUTAN...younger than the one from his\n          Benzini days. Jacob stops. He steadies himself.\n          Jacob lets go of the walker and reaches his arm out to the\n          Orangutan's cage.\n          The Orangutan studies him for a moment. Judging.\n          Jacob keeps his arm extended, which isn't easy for him.\n          The Orangutan then extends his hand through the bars to\n          Jacob's hand.\n          Jacob's fingers entwine around the Orangutan's hand. They\n          hold for a moment. Jacob smiles.\n\n<b>                         JACOB\n<\/b>          Thank you, Ma'am.\n\n<b>                         THE END\n<\/b>\n\n\n\n<\/pre><br>\n<table width=\"85%\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\">\n  <tr> \n\t<td align=center><img src=\"\/posters\/Water-for-Elephants.jpg\" border=0>\n\t<td><h1>Water for Elephants<\/h1><br><br>\n\t    <b>Writers<\/b> : &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/writer.php?w=Richard Lagravenese\" title=\"Scripts by Richard Lagravenese\">Richard Lagravenese<\/a><br>\n    \t<b>Genres<\/b> : &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/genre\/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/genre\/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance<\/a><br><br><br>\n\t\t\n\t\t<a href=\"\/Movie Scripts\/Water for Elephants Script.html#comments\" title=\"Water for Elephants comments\">User Comments<\/a>\n\t<\/td>\n<\/table>\n<br><br>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img src=\"\/images\/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"  alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=1><br>\nBack to IMSDb<\/a>\n<\/div><br>\n<br><br>\n  <\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<br><br>\n<\/table>\n\n<table width=\"99%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"body\">\n  <tr> \n  <td background=\"\/images\/reel.gif\" height=\"13\" colspan=\"2\">\n<\/table>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database (IMSDb)\">Index<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/submit\" title=\"Submit scripts\">Submit<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/links\" title=\"Other sites\">Links<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/link to us\" title=\"Link to IMSDb\">Link to us<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/feeds\" title=\"IMSDb RSS Feeds\">RSS Feeds<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/privacy\">Privacy policy<\/a> \n<\/div>\n\n<br \/>\n\n<\/body>\n<\/html>","id":384,"split":"train"}
