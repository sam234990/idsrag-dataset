{"ori_id":"e11918fe15248b740d970ca62dfd10cdd4065f6f","title":"A Bride of the Plains","context":"A Bride of the Plains\n The story is set in Hungary and the scene is laid in a village close to the Maros.\nThe sharp, cracked sound of the Elevation bell breaks the silence of the summer morning. The good Pater Bonifacius is saying Mass: he, at any rate, is astir and busy with his day\u2019s work and obligations. Surely it is strange that at so late an hour in mid-September, with the maize waiting to be gathered in, the population of Marosfalva should be still absent from the fields! Hej\u00a0! But, stranger, what would you\u00a0? Such a day is-this Fourteenth of September. What\u00a0? You did not know it? The Fourteenth of September, the ugliest, blackest, most God forsaken day in the whole year! What kind of a stranger are you if you do not know that?\nOn this hideous day all the finest lads in the village are taken away to be made into soldiers by the abominable Government? Three years! Why, the lad is a mere child when he goes-one-and-twenty on his last birthday, bless him! still wanting a mother\u2019s care of his stomach, and a father\u2019s heavy stick across his back from time to time to keep him from too much love-making.\n\nThree years\u00a0! When he comes back he is a man and has notions of his own. Three years! What are the chances he comes back at all? Bosnia! Where in the world is that? My God, how they hate it! They must go through with it, though they hate it all-every moment. They hate to be packed into railway carriages like so many dried heads of maize in a barn... and the rude alien sergeant with his 'Vorwarts!' and 'Marsch!' and 'Rechts!' and 'Links!' I ask you in the name of the Holy Virgin what kind of gibberish is that?\nOn this particular fourteenth of September it is Andor's turn due to go. On the eve preceding it, at the village merrymaking, as the whole population spends its last happy hours trying to forget the hideous events that will occur in the morning, he tokens himself to Elsa the village beauty.\nIt is Elsa and Andor that everyone is watching. He is tall and broad-shouldered with the supple limbs of a young stag, and the mad irresponsible movements of a young colt. The young couple dread the next day, which comes all too soon. They are at the station now, the last bell has sounded. For each lad only one girl, and there she is at the foot of the carriage steps, a corner of her ribbon, or handkerchief or cotton petticoat stuffed into her mouth to prevent herself from bursting into sobs. The pain and loss of conscription.\nIt is some time since Andor was conscripted but there has been no news of him so Elsa is forced to betroth herself to the wealthy and sinister B\u00e9la, after being placed in the terrible alternative of either being faithless to Andor or disobedient to her mother. It is characteristic of Hungarian society at the time that of the two options available the latter seemed by far the more heinous.\nOn the eve of Elsa's wedding Andor suddenly reappears, and is indirectly concerned in the assassination of B\u00e9la which takes place the same night.\nThe story begins and ends with festival mingled with tragedy.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, A Bride of the Plains, by Baroness Emmuska\nOrczy\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Thank God\nyou were spared the sight which surely would have broken your heart! You\nnever lived to see your country free. Alas! no man for many generations\nto come will see that now. The Magyar peasant lad--upon the vast,\nmysterious plains of his native soil--will alone continue to dream of\nnational liberty, of religious and political freedom, and vaguely hope\nthat some day another Louis Kossuth will arise again and restore to him\nand to his race that sense of dignity, of justice and of right which the\nTeuton has striven for centuries to crush.\n\nEMMUSKA ORCZY.\n\nSnowfield,\n  Bearsted,\n    Kent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\nCHAPTER                                                   PAGE\n\nI.      \"GOD BLESS THEM ALL!

they are good lads.\"\n\n\nIt was now close on eight o'clock and more than two hours ago since\nfirst the dawn broke over that low-lying horizon line which seems so far\naway, and tinged the vast immensity of the plain first with grey and\nthen with mauve and pale-toned emerald, with rose and carmine and\ncrimson and blood-red, until the sun--triumphant and glorious at\nlast--woke the sunflowers from their sleep, gilded every tiny blade of\ngrass and every sprig of rosemary, and caused every head of stately\nmaize to quiver with delight at the warmth of his kiss.\n\nThe plain stretched its limitless expanse as far as human eye can\nreach--a sea of tall straight stems, with waves of brilliant green and\nplume-crowned crests shimmering like foam in the sunlight.\n\nAs far as human eye can see!--and further, much further still!--the sea\nof maize, countless upright stems, hundreds of thousands of emerald\ngreen sheaths crowned with flaxen tendrils like a maiden's hair; down on\nthe ground--a carpet for the feet of the majestic corn--hundreds and\nthousands of orange-coloured pumpkins turning their huge shiny carcases\nto the ripening rays of the sun, and all around in fantastic lines,\nrows of tall sunflowers, a blaze of amber, with thick velvety hearts\nladen with seed.\n\nAnd all of it stretching out apparently to infinity beyond that horizon\nline which is still hidden by a silvery haze, impalpable womb that\ncradles the life-giving heat.\n\nStately stems of maize--countless as the pebbles on a beach, as the\nspecks of foam upon the crest of a wave, limitless as the sea and like\nthe sea mutable, ever-changing, restless--bending to every breath of the\nsummer breeze, full of strange, sweet sounds, of moanings and of sighs,\nas the emerald sheaths tremble in the wind, or down below the bright\nyellow carcases of the pumpkins crack and shiver in the growing heat.\n\nAn ocean of tall maize and gaily-coloured pumpkins as far as the eye can\nreach, and long, dividing lines of amber-coloured sunflowers, vivid and\nriotous, flaunting their crude colouring in the glowing sunlight.\n\nHere and there the dull, dark green of hemp breaks the unvarying\nstretches of maize, and far away there is a tanya (cottage) with a group\nof stunted acacias near it, and a well whose tall, gaunt arm stretches\nweirdly up to the sky, whilst to the south the sluggish Maros winds its\nslow course lazily toward the parent stream.\n\nAn ocean of maize and of pumpkins and of sunflowers, with here and there\nthe tall, crested stems of hemp, and above it the sky--blue and already\nglowing through the filmy mist which every minute grows more ethereal\nand more impalpable as veil upon veil of heat-holding vapours are drawn\nfrom before its face.\n\nA beautiful morning in mid-September, and yet in all this vast immensity\nof fertile land and ripening fruit there is no sign of human toil, no\nsound of beast or creaking waggon, no sign of human life around that\ndistant tanya.\n\nThe tiny lizard in his comfortable position on the summit of a gigantic\npumpkin can continue his matutinal sleep in peace; the stork can\ncontinue undisturbed his preparations for his impending long voyage over\nseas. Man has not yet thought to break by travail or by song the\npeaceful silence of the plain.\n\nAnd yet the village lies not very far away, close to the Maros; the\nsmall, low, hemp-thatched houses scarcely peep above the sea of\ntall-stemmed maize, only the white-washed tower of the church with its\nred-painted roof stands out clear and abrupt against the sky.\n\nAnd now the sharp, cracked sound of the Elevation bell breaks the\nsilence of the summer's morning. The good Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius is saying\nMass; he, at any rate, is astir and busy with his day's work and\nobligations. Surely it is strange that at so late an hour in\nmid-September, with the maize waiting to be gathered in, the population\nof Marosfalva should still be absent from the fields.\n\nHej! But stranger, what would you! Such a day is this fourteenth of\nSeptember.\n\nWhat? You did not know it? The fourteenth of September, the ugliest,\nblackest, most God-forsaken day in the whole year!\n\nYou did not know? You cannot guess? Then what kind of a stranger are you\nif you do not know that on this hideous fourteenth of September all the\nfinest lads of Marosfalva and the villages around are taken away by the\nabominable government? Away for three years to be made into soldiers, to\ndrill and to march, to carry guns and bayonets, to obey words of command\nthat they don't understand, to be packed off from place to place--from\nArad to Bistricz, from Kecskem\u00c3\u00a9t to Nagyv\u00c3\u00a1rad, aye? and as far as Bosnia\ntoo--wherever that may be!\n\nYes, kind Sir! the lads of Marosfalva and of Fekete, of Kender and of\nG\u00c3\u00b6rcz, are taken away just like that, in batches every year, packed into\none of those detestable railways like so many heads of cattle and\nseparated from their mothers, their sisters, their sweethearts, all\nbecause a hateful government for which the people of Marosfalva do not\ncare one brass fill\u00c3\u00a9r, has so decreed it.\n\nMind you, it is the same in all the other villages, and in every town in\nHungary--so at least we have been given to understand--but we have\nnothing to do with other villages or with the towns: they do just as the\ngood God wills them to do. It is our lads--the lads of Marosfalva and\nKender and Fekete and G\u00c3\u00b6rcz--who have to be packed off in train-loads\nto-day and taken away from us for three years.\n\nThree years! Why, the lad is a mere child when he goes--one-and-twenty\non his last birthday, bless him!--still wanting a mother's care of his\nstomach and his clothes, and a father's heavy stick across his back from\ntime to time to keep him from drink and too much love-making.\n\nThree years! When he comes back he is a man, has notions of his own, has\nseen the world and cares no more about his native village and the narrow\ncottage where he used to run in and out bare-footed, bare-chested,\nbare-headed and comfortably dirty from head to foot.\n\nThree years! And what are the chances that he come back at all? Bosnia?\nWhere in the world is that? And if you are a soldier, why then you go to\nwar, you get shot at, killed may be, or at any rate maimed. Three years!\nYou may never come back! And when you do you are not the same youngster\nwhom your mother kissed, your father whacked, and your sweetheart wept\nover.\n\nThree years! Nay, but 'tis a lifetime. Mother is old, she may never see\nher son again. Girls are vain and fickle, they will turn their thoughts\nin other directions--there are the men who have done their military\nservice, who have paid their toll to the abominable government up at\nBudapest and who are therefore free to court and free to marry.\n\nAye! Aye! That's how it is. They must go through with it, though they\nhate it all--every moment of it. They hate to be packed into railway\ncarriages like so many dried heads of maize in a barn, they hate to wear\nthe heavy cloth clothes, the hard boots, the leather pouches and belts.\nMy God, how they hate it!\n\nAnd the rude alien sergeant, with his \"Vorw\u00c3\u00a4rts!\" and \"Marsch!\" and\n\"Rechts\" and \"Links\"--I ask you in the name of the Holy Virgin what kind\nof gibberish is that?\n\nBut they must all go!--all those, at least, who are whole and sound in\nbody. Bless them! They are sound enough when they go! It is when they\ncome back! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\n\nYes! They must all go, those who are sound in eyes and wind and limb,\nand it is very difficult to cheat the commission who come to take our\nlads away. There was Benk\u00c3\u00b3, for instance; he starved himself for three\nmonths this summer, hoping to reduce his chest measurements by a few\nneedful centim\u00c3\u00a8tres; but it was no use. The doctor who examined him said\nthat with regular food and plenty of exercise he would soon put on more\nflesh, and he would get both for the next three years. And J\u00c3\u00a1nos--you\nremember?--he chopped off one of his toes--thinking that would get him\noff those hated three years of service; but it seems there is a new\ndecree by which the lads need not be possessed of all ten toes in order\nto serve the hateful government.\n\nNo, no! It is no use trying to get out of it. They measure you, and\nbang your chest and your back, they look at your eyes and make you open\nyour mouth to look at your teeth, but anyhow they take you away for\nthree years.\n\nThey make you swear that you will faithfully serve your country and your\nKing during that time, that you will obey your superiors, and follow\nyour leader wherever he may command, over land and by water. By water! I\nask you! When there was Albert and Jen\u00c3\u00b6 who could not bear even the\nsight of water; they would not have gone in a boat on the Maros if you\nhad offered them a gold piece each! How could they swear that they would\nfollow some fool of a German officer on water?\n\nThey could not swear that. They knew they could not do it. But they were\nclapped in prison like common malefactors and treated like brigands and\nthieves until they did swear. And after that--well! they had once to\ncross the Theiss in a ferry-boat--they were made to do it!\n\nOh, no! Nothing happened to them then, but Albert came back after his\nthree years' service, with two of his front teeth gone, and we all know\nthat Jen\u00c3\u00b6 now is little better than an idiot.\n\nSo now you know, stranger, why we at Marosfalva call the fourteenth day\nof September the very blackest in the whole calendar, and why at eight\no'clock in the morning nobody is at work in the fields.\n\nFor the fourteenth day being such a black one, we must all make the most\nof the few hours that come before it. At nine o'clock of that miserable\nmorning the packing of our lads into the train will commence, but until\nthen they are making merry, bless them! They are true Hungarians, you\nknow! They will dance, and they will sing, they will listen to gipsy\nmusic and kiss the girls so long as there is breath in their body, so\nlong as they are free to do it.\n\nAt nine o'clock to-day they cease to be free men, they are under the\norders of corporals and sergeants and officers who will command them to\ngo \"Vorw\u00c3\u00a4rts\" and \"Rechts\" and \"Links\" and all that God-forsaken\ngibberish, and put them in irons and on bread and water if they do not\nobey. But yesterday, on the thirteenth of September that is, they were\nstill free to do as they liked: they could dance and sing and get drunk\nas much as they chose.\n\nSo the big barn that belongs to Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein, the Jew, is thrown\nopen for a night's dancing and music and jollification. At five o'clock\nin the afternoon the gipsies tuned up; there was a supper which lasted\nmany hours, after which the dancing began. The first cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s was struck\nup at eight o'clock last evening, the last one is being danced now at\neight o'clock in the morning, while the whole plain lies in silence\nunder the shimmering sky, and while Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius reads his mass all\nalone in the little church, and prays fervently for the lads who are\ngoing away to-day for three years: away from his care and his tender,\npaternal attention, away from their homes, their weeping mothers and\nsorrowing sweethearts.\n\nGod bless them all! They are good lads, but weak, impulsive, easily led\ntoward good or evil. They are dancing now, when they should be praying,\nbut God bless them all! They are good lads!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\"Money won't buy everything.\"\n\n\nInside the barn the guttering candles were burning low. No one thought\nof blowing them out, so they were just left to smoke and to smoulder,\nand to help render the atmosphere even more stifling than it otherwise\nwould have been.\n\nThe heat has become almost unbearable--unbearable, that is, to anyone\nnot wholly intent on pleasure to the exclusion of every other sensation,\nevery other consciousness. The barn built of huge pine logs,\nstraw-thatched and raftered, is filled to overflowing with people--men,\nwomen, even children--all bent upon one great, all-absorbing\nobject--that object, forgetfulness.\n\nThe indifferent, the stolid, may call it what he will, but it is the\ncommon wish to forget that has brought all these people--young and\nold--together in Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein's barn this night--the desire to\nforget that hideous, fateful fourteenth of September which comes with\nsuch heartrending regularity year after year--the desire to forget that\nthe lads, the flower of the neighbouring villages, are going away to-day\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. for three years?--nay! very likely for ever!--three years! and all\npacked up like cattle in a railway truck! and put under the orders of\nsome brutal sergeant who is not Hungarian, and can only say \"Vorw\u00c3\u00a4rts!\"\nor \"Marsch!\" and is backed in his arbitrary commands by the whole weight\nof government, King and country.\n\nFor three years!--and there is always war going on somewhere--and that\nawful Bosnia! wherever it may be--lads from Hungarian villages go there\nsound in body and in limb and come back bent with ague, halt, lame or\nblind.\n\nThree years! More like for ever!\n\nAnd therefore the whole population of Marosfalva and of the villages\nround spends its last happy four-and-twenty hours in trying to forget\nthat nine o'clock of the fourteenth day of September is approaching with\nsure and giant strides; everyone has a wish to forget; the parents and\ngrandparents, the sisters, the sweethearts, the lads themselves! The\nfuture is so hideous, let the joy of the present kill all thoughts of\nthose coming three years.\n\nMarosfalva is the rallying-point, where this final annual jollification\ntakes place. They all come over on the thirteenth from Fekete and G\u00c3\u00b6rcz,\nand Kender, in order to dance and to sing at Marosfalva in the barn\nwhich belongs to Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein the Jew. Marosfalva boasts of a\nrailway station and it is from here that at nine o'clock in the morning\nthe lads will be entrained; so all day on the thirteenth there has been\na pilgrimage along the cross-roads from the outlying villages and\nhamlets round Marosfalva--a stream of men and women and young children\nall determined to forget for a few hours the coming separation of the\nmorrow; by five o'clock in the afternoon all those had assembled who had\nmeant to come and dancing in the barn had begun.\n\nIgn\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein's barn has always been the setting in which the final\ndrama of the happy year is acted. After that night spent there in\ndancing and music and merry-making, down goes the curtain on the comedy\nof life and the tragedy of tears begins.\n\nSince five o'clock in the afternoon the young people have been\ndancing--waltzing, polkaing, dancing the cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s--mostly the cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s,\nthe dance of the nation, of the people, the most exhilarating, most\nentrancing, most voluptuous dance that feet of man have ever trod. The\ngirls and lads are indefatigable, the slow and languorous Lassu (slow\nmovement) alternates with the mad, merry cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s, they twirl and twist,\nadvance, retreat, separate and reunite in a mad, intoxicating whirl.\nSmall booted feet stamp on the rough wooden floor, sending up clouds of\ndust. What matter if the air becomes more and more stifling? There are\ntears and sighs to be stifled too.\n\n\"Ho, there, czig\u00c3\u00a1ny! Play up! Faster! Faster! 'Tis not a funeral dirge\nyou are playing.\"\n\nThe gipsy musicians, hot and perspiring, have blown and scraped and\nbanged for fifteen solid hours; no one would ever think of suggesting\nthat a gipsy needed rest; the clarinetist, it is true, rolled off his\nseat at one time, and had to be well shaken ere he could blow again, but\nthe leader--as good a leader, mind you, as could be found in the\nkingdom--had only paused when the dancers were exhausted, or when bite\nand sup were placed before him. There they were, perched up on a rough\nplatform made up of packing-cases borrowed from the station-master; the\nczimbalom player in the centre, his fat, brown hands wield the tiny\nclappers with unerring precision, up and down the strings, with that\nsoft, lingering tone which partakes of the clavecins and the harp alike.\nAt the back the double-bass, lean and dark, with jet-black eyes that\nstare stolidly at his leader.\n\nThere is a second fiddle, and the fat clarinetist and, of course, the\nleader--he whose match could not be found in the kingdom. He stands on\nthe very edge of the rough platform, his fiddle under his chin, and he\nstoops well forward, so that his hands and instrument almost touch the\nforemost of the dancing pairs.\n\nThey--the dancers--crowd closely round the gipsy band, for so must the\ncs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s be danced, as near the musicians as possible, as close together\nas the wide, sweeping petticoats of the girls will allow.\n\nSuch petticoats! One on the top of the other, ten or a dozen or more,\nand all of different colour: the girls are proud of these\npetticoats--the number of them is a sign of prosperity; and now as they\ndance and swing from the hips these petticoats fly out, caught by the\ncurrents of air until they look like gargantuan showers of\nvividly-coloured petals shaken by giant hands.\n\nAbove the petticoats the girls' waists look slim in the dark,\ntight-fitting corslet, above which again rises the rich, olive-tinted\nbreast and throat; full white sleeves of linen crown the bare, ruddy\narms, and ribbons of national colours--red, white and green--float from\nthe shoulders and the waist.\n\nThe smooth, thick hair is closely plaited, from the crown of the head in\ntwo long, tight plaits; it is drawn rigidly away from the forehead,\ngiving that quaint, hard finish to the round, merry face which is so\ncharacteristic of the Asiatic ancestry.\n\nEach one of them a little picture which seems to have stepped straight\nout of a Velasquez canvas, the bell-shaped skirt, the stiff corslet, the\nstraight, tight hair and round eyes full of vitality.\n\nThe men wear their linen shirt and full trousers with fringed,\nembroidered ends, the leather waistcoat and broad belt covered with\nmetal bosses and wrought with bright-coloured woollen threads. They get\nvery excited in the mazes of the dance, they shout to the gipsies to\nplay faster and ever faster; each holds his partner tightly round the\nslim waist and swings her round and round, till she stumbles, giddy and\nalmost faint in his arms.\n\nAnd round the dancers in a semicircle the spectators stand in a dense\ncrowd--the older folk and the girls who have not secured partners--they\nwatch and watch, indefatigable like the dancers, untiring like the\nmusicians. And behind this semicircle, in the dark corners of the barn,\nthe children foot it too, with the same ardour, the same excitement as\ntheir elders.\n\nThe last cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s of this memorable night! It is eight o'clock now, and\nthrough the apertures in the log wall the brilliant light of this late\nsummer's morning enters triumphant and crude.\n\nAndor is dancing with Elsa--pretty, fair-haired Elsa, the daughter of\nold Kapus Benk\u00c3\u00b3,[1] an old reprobate, if ever there was one. Such a\nhandsome couple they look. Is it not a shame that Andor must go\nto-day--for three years, perhaps for ever?\n\n[Footnote 1: In Hungary the surname precedes the Christian name.]\n\nThe tears that have struggled up to Elsa's tender blue eyes, despite her\nwill to keep them back, add to the charm of her engaging personality,\nthey help to soften the somewhat serious expression of her young face.\nHer cheeks are glowing with the excitement of the dance, her graceful\nfigure bends to the pressure of Andor's arm around her waist.\n\nTen or a dozen cotton petticoats are tied round that slim waist of hers,\nno two of a like colour, and as she twists and twirls in Andor's arms\nthe petticoats fly out, till she looks like a huge flower of many hues\nwith superposed corollas, blue, green, pink and yellow, beneath which\nher small feet shod in boots of brilliant leather look like two crimson\nstamens.\n\nThe tight-fitting corslet bodice and the full, white sleeves of the\nshift make her figure appear peculiarly slim and girlish, and her bare\nthroat and shoulders are smooth and warmly tinted like some luscious\nfruit.\n\nNo wonder that Andor feels this dance, this movement, the music, the\ngirl's sweet, quick breath, going to his head like wine. Elsa was always\npretty, always dainty and gentle, but now she is excited, tearful at the\ncoming parting, and by all the saints a more exquisite woman never came\nout of Paradise!\n\nThe semicircle of spectators composed of older folk draws closer round\nthe dancers, but the other couples remain comparatively unheeded. It is\nElsa and Andor whom everyone is watching.\n\nHe is tall and broad-shouldered, with the supple limbs of a young stag,\nand the mad, irresponsible movements of a colt. His dark eyes shine like\ntwo stars out of his sun-burnt face; his muscular arms encircle Elsa's\nfine waist with a grip that is almost masterful. The wide sleeves of his\nlinen shirt flutter above his shoulders till they look like wings and he\nlike some messenger of the gods come to carry this exquisite prey off\nfrom the earth.\n\n\"What a well-matched couple!\" murmur the older women as they watch.\n\n\"Elsa will be the beauty of the village within the next year, mark what\nI say!\" added a kindly old soul, turning to her neighbour--a slatternly,\nill-kempt, middle-aged woman, who was casting looks on Andor and Elsa\nthat were none too kind.\n\n\"Hm!\" retorted the latter, with sour mien, \"then 'tis as well that that\ngood-for-nothing will be safely out of the way.\"\n\n\"I would not call Andor good-for-nothing, Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni,\"[2] said one of the\nmen who stood close by, \"he has not had much chance to do anything for\nhimself yet. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n[Footnote 2: Aunt Irma--the words aunt (_n\u00c3\u00a9ni_) and uncle (_b\u00c3\u00a1csi_) are\nused indiscriminately in Hungary when addressing elderly people, and do\nnot necessarily imply any relationship.]\n\n\"And he never will,\" snapped the woman, with a click of her thin jaws,\n\"I know the sort--always going to do wonderful things in a future which\nnever comes. Well! at any rate while he is a soldier they will teach him\nthat he is no better than other lads that come from the same village,\nand not even as good, seeing that he has never any money in his wallet.\"\n\n\"Andor will be rich some day,\" suggested the kindly old soul who had\nfirst spoken, \"don't you forget it, Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni.\"\n\n\"I have no special wish to remember it, my good Kati,\" retorted Irma\ndryly.\n\n\"I thought,\" murmured the other, \"seeing that Andor has really courted\nElsa this summer that .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. perhaps .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"My daughter has plenty of admirers,\" said Irma, in her bitter-toned,\nsnappish way, \"and has no reason to wait for one who only may be rich\nsome day.\"\n\n\"Bah! Lakatos P\u00c3\u00a1l cannot live for ever. Andor will have every fill\u00c3\u00a9r of\nhis money when he dies, and P\u00c3\u00a1l will cut up very well.\"\n\n\"Lakatos P\u00c3\u00a1l is a youngish man--not fifty, I imagine,\" concluded Irma\nwith a sneer. \"He may live another thirty years, and Elsa would be an\nold woman herself by then.\"\n\nThe other woman said nothing more after that. It was no use arguing the\npoint. Irma was the wife of old Kapus--both of them as shiftless,\nthriftless, ill-conditioned a pair as ever stole the daylight from God\nin order to waste it in idleness. How they came to be blessed with such\na pretty, winning daughter as Elsa an all too-indulgent God only knew.\n\nWhat, however, was well known throughout the village was that as Kapus\nand his wife never had a crown to bless themselves with, and had never\nsaved enough to earn a rest for themselves in their old age, they had\nlong ago determined that their daughter should be the means of bringing\nprosperity to them as soon as she was old enough for the\nmarriage-market.\n\nElsa was beautiful! Thank the good God for that! Kapus had never saved\nenough to give her a marriage-portion either, and had she been ugly, or\nonly moderately pretty, it would have been practically impossible to\nfind a husband for her. But if she became the beauty of Marosfalva--as\nindeed she was already--there would be plenty of rich men who would be\nwilling to waive the question of the marriage-portion for the sake of\nthe glory of having captured the loveliest matrimonial prize in the\nwhole countryside.\n\n\"Leave Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni alone, mother,\" said the man who had first taken up the\ncudgels in favour of Andor; \"we all know that she has very ambitious\nviews for Elsa. Please God she may not be disappointed.\"\n\nFrom more than one group of spectators came similar or other comments on\npretty Elsa and her partner. The general consensus of opinion seemed to\nbe that it was as well Andor was going away for three years. Old Kapus\nand his wife would never allow their daughter to marry a man with\npockets as empty as their own, and it was no use waiting for dead men's\nshoes. Lakatos P\u00c3\u00a1l, the rich uncle, from whom Andor was bound to inherit\nsome day, was little past the prime of life. Until he died how would\nAndor and a penniless wife contrive to live? For Lakatos P\u00c3\u00a1l was a miser\nand hoarded his money--moreover, he was a confirmed bachelor and\nwoman-hater; he would do nothing for Andor if the young man chose to\nmarry.\n\nAh, well! it was a pity! for a better-looking, better-matched pair could\nnot be found in the whole county of Arad.\n\n\"Lucky for you, B\u00c3\u00a9la, that Andor goes off to-day for three years,\" said\na tall, handsome girl to her neighbour; \"you would not have had much\nchance with Elsa otherwise.\"\n\nThe man beside her made no immediate reply; he was standing with legs\nwide apart, his hands buried in the pockets of his trousers. At the\ngirl's words, which were accompanied by a provocative glance from her\nlarge, dark eyes, he merely shrugged his wide shoulders, and jingled\nsome money in his pockets.\n\nThe girl laughed.\n\n\"Money won't buy everything, you know, my good B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" she said.\n\n\"It will buy most things,\" he retorted.\n\n\"The consent of Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni, for instance,\" she suggested.\n\n\"And a girl's willingness to exchange the squalor of a mud hut for\ncomfort, luxury, civilization.\"\n\nUnlike most of the young men here to-night, who wore the characteristic\ncostume of the countryside--full, white linen shirt and trousers, broad\nleather belt, embossed and embroidered and high leather boots, B\u00c3\u00a9la was\ndressed in a town suit of dark-coloured cloth, cut by a provincial\ntailor from Arad. He was short of stature, though broad-shouldered and\nfirmly knit, but his face was singularly ugly, owing to the terrible\nmisfortune which had befallen him when he lost his left eye. The scar\nand hollow which were now where the eye had once been gave the whole\nface a sinister expression, which was further accentuated by the\nirregular line of the eyebrows and the sneer which habitually hovered\nround the full, hard lips.\n\nB\u00c3\u00a9la was not good to look on; and this is a serious defect in a young\nman in Hungary, but he was well endowed with other attributes which made\nhim very attractive to the girls. He had a fine and lucrative position,\nseeing that he was his Lordship's bailiff, and had an excellent salary,\na good house and piece of land of his own, as well as the means of\nadding considerably to his income, since his lordship left him to\nconclude many a bargain over corn and plums, and horses and pigs. Er\u00c3\u00b6s\nB\u00c3\u00a9la was rich and influential. He lived in a stone-built house, which\nhad a garden round it, and at least five rooms inside, with a separate\nkitchen and a separate living-room, therefore he was a very eligible\nyoung man and one greatly favoured by mothers of penniless girls; nor\ndid the latter look askance on B\u00c3\u00a9la despite the fact that he had only\none eye and that never a pleasant word escaped his lips.\n\nEven now he was looking on at the dancing with a heavy scowl upon his\nface. The girl near him--she with the dark, Oriental eyes and the thin,\nhooked nose, Klara Goldstein the Jewess--gave him a nudge with her\nbrown, pointed elbow.\n\n\"I wouldn't let Andor see the temper you are in, my friend,\" she said,\nwith a sarcastic little laugh; \"we don't want any broken bones before\nthe train goes off this morning.\"\n\n\"There will be broken bones if he does not look out,\" muttered the other\nbetween his teeth, as he drew a tightly clenched fist from his pocket.\n\n\"Bah! why should you care?\" retorted Klara, who seemed to take an impish\ndelight in teasing the young man, \"you are not in love with Elsa, are\nyou?\"\n\n\"What is it to you?\" growled B\u00c3\u00a9la surlily.\n\n\"Nothing,\" she replied, \"only that we have always been friends, you and\nI--eh, B\u00c3\u00a9la?\"\n\nAnd she turned her large, lustrous eyes upon him, peering at him through\nher long black lashes. She was a handsome girl, of course, and she knew\nit--knew how to use her eyes, and make the men forget that she was only\na Jewess, a thing to be played with but despised--no better than a gipsy\nwench, not for a Hungarian peasant to look upon as an equal, to think of\nas a possible mate.\n\nB\u00c3\u00a9la, whose blood was hot in him, what with the wine which he had drunk\nand the jealous temper which was raging in his brain, was nevertheless\nsober enough not to meet the languorous glances which the handsome\nJewess bestowed so freely upon him.\n\n\"We are still friends--are we not, B\u00c3\u00a9la?\" she reiterated slowly.\n\n\"Of course--why not?\" he grunted, \"what has our friendship to do with\nAndor and Elsa?\"\n\n\"Only this: that I don't like to see a friend of mine make a fool of\nhimself over a girl who does not care one hairpin for him.\"\n\nB\u00c3\u00a9la smothered a curse.\n\n\"How do you know that?\" he asked.\n\n\"Everyone knows that Elsa is over head and ears in love with Andor, and\njust won't look at anyone else.\"\n\n\"Oho!\" he sneered, \"everyone knows that, do they? Well! you can tell\nthat busy-body everyone from me that before the year is out Kapus Elsa\nwill be tokened to me, and that when Andor comes back from having\nmarched and drilled and paced the barrack-yard he will find that Kapus\nElsa is Kapus no longer, but Er\u00c3\u00b6s, the wife of Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la, the mother of\nhis first-born. To this I have made up my mind, and when I make up my\nmind to anything, neither God nor the devil dares to stand in my way.\"\n\n\"Hush! hush! in Heaven's name,\" she protested quickly, \"the neighbours\nwill hear you.\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders, and murmured something very uncomplimentary\nanent the ultimate destination of those neighbours.\n\nSome of them certainly had heard what he said, for he had not been at\npains to lower his voice. His riches and his position had made him\nsomething of an oracle in Marosfalva, and he held all the peasantry in\nsuch contempt that he cared little what everyone thought of him. He\ntherefore remained indifferent and sulky now whilst many glances of\ngood-humoured mockery were levelled upon him.\n\nNo one, of course, thought any the worse of Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la for desiring the\nbeauty of the village for himself--he was rich and could marry whom he\npleased, and that he should loudly and openly proclaim his determination\nto possess himself of the beautiful prize was only in accordance with\nthe impulsive, hot-headed, somewhat bombastic temperament of the Magyars\nthemselves.\n\nFortunately those chiefly concerned in Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la's loudly spoken\ndetermination had heard nothing of the colloquy between him and the\nJewess. The wild, loud music of the cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s, their own gyrations and\nexcitement, shut them out entirely from their surroundings.\n\nTheir stamping, tripping, twirling feet had carried them into another\nworld altogether; Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein's barn had become a fairy bower, they\nthemselves were spirits living in that realm of bliss; there was no\nlonger any impending separation, no military service, no blank and\ndesolate three years! Andor, his arm tightly clasped round Elsa's waist,\nhis head bowed till his lips touched her bare shoulder, contrived to\nwhisper magic words in her ear.\n\nMagic words?--simple, commonplace words, spoken by myriads of men before\nand since into myriads of willing ears, in every tongue this earth hath\never known. But to Elsa it seemed as if the Magyar tongue had never\nbefore sounded so exquisite! To her the words were magic because they\nwrought a miracle in her. She had been a girl--a child ere those words\nwere spoken. She liked Andor, she liked her father and her mother,\nlittle Emma over the way, Mari n\u00c3\u00a9ni, who was always kind. She had loved\nthem all, been pleased when she saw them, glad to give them an\naffectionate kiss.\n\nBut now, since that last cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s had begun, a strange and mysterious\ncurrent had gone from Andor's arm right through her heart; something had\nhappened, which caused her cheeks to glow with a fire other than that\nproduced by the heat of the dance and made her own hands tremble when\nthey rested on Andor's shoulder. And there was that in his look which\nmade her eyes burn and fill with tears.\n\n\"You are beautiful, Elsa! I love you!\"\n\nShe could not answer him, of course; how could she, when she felt that\nher throat was choked with sobs? Yet she felt so happy, so happy that\nnever since the day of her first communion, when Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius had\nblessed her and assured her that her soul was as white as that of an\nangel--never since then had she known such perfect, such absolute\nhappiness. She could not speak, she almost thought once that she was\ngoing to faint, so strange was the thrill of joy which went right\nthrough her when Andor's lips rested for one brief, sweet moment upon\nher shoulder.\n\n\nAnd now the lights are burning low, the gipsies scrape their fiddles\nwith a kind of wild enthusiasm, which pervades them just as much as the\ndancers. Round and round in a mad twirl now, the men hold the girls with\nboth hands by the waist, the girls put a hand on each of their partner's\nshoulders; thus they spin round and round, petticoats flying, booted\nfeet stamping the ground.\n\nThe young faces are all hot and streaming, quick breaths come in short,\npanting gasps from these young chests. The spectators join in the\nexcitement, the men stamp and clap their heels to the rhythm of the\ndance, the women beat their hands one against the other to that same\nwild, syncopated measure. Old men grasp middle-aged women round the\nwaist; smiling, self-deprecatingly they too begin to tread; Hej! 'Tis\nnot so long ago we were young too, and that wild Hungarian cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s fires\nthe blood until it glows afresh.\n\nEveryone moves, every body sways, it is impossible to keep quite still\nwhile that intoxicating rhythm fills the air.\n\nOnly Klara the Jewess stands by, stolid and immovable; the Magyar blood\nis not in her, hers is the languorous Oriental blood, the supple,\nsinuous movements of the Levant. She watches this bacchanalian whirligig\nwith a sneer upon her thin, red lips. Beside her Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la too is\nstill, the scowl has darkened on his face, his one eye leers across the\ngroup of twirling dancers to that one couple close to the musicians'\nplatform.\n\nIn the noise that goes on around him he cannot, of course, hear the\nwords which Andor speaks, but he sees the movements of the young man's\nlips, and the blush which deepens over Elsa's face. That one eye of his,\nkeener than any pair of eyes, has seen the furtive kiss, quick and\nglowing, which grazed the girl's bare shoulder, and noted the quiver\nwhich went right through the young, slender body and the look that shot\nthrough the quickly-veiled blue eyes.\n\nHe was only a peasant, a rough son of the soil, whose temperament was\nhot with passion and whose temper had never known a curb. He had never\nrealized until this moment how beautiful Elsa was, and how madly he\nloved her. For he called the jealous rage within by the sacred name of\nlove, and love to a Magyar peasant is his whole existence, the pivot\nround which he frames his life, his thoughts of the present, his dreams\nof the future.\n\nThe soil and the woman!--they are his passions, his desires, his\nreligion--to own a bit of land--of Hungarian land--and the woman whom he\nloves. Those two possessions will satisfy him--beyond these there is\nnothing worth having--a plough, of course--a hut wherein to sleep--an ox\nor two, perhaps--a cow--a horse.\n\nBut the soil and the woman on whom he has fixed his love--we'll call it\nlove .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. he certainly calls it so--those two possessions make the\nHungarian peasant more contented than any king or millionaire of Western\ncivilization.\n\nEr\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la had the land. His father left him a dozen kataszter (land\nmeasure about two and three-quarter acres) or so; Elsa was the woman\nwhom he loved, and the only question was who--he or Andor--would be\nstrong enough to gain the object of his desire.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\"You will wait for me?\"\n\n\nBut now it is all over, the final bar of the cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s has been played,\nthe last measure trodden. From the railway station far away the sharp\nclang of a bell has announced the doleful fact that in half an hour the\ntrain will start for Arad, thence to Brass\u00c3\u00b3, where the recruits will be\nenrolled, ticketed, docketed like so many heads of cattle--mostly\nunwilling--made to do service for their country.\n\nIn half an hour the train starts, and there is so much still to say that\nhas been left unsaid, so many kisses to exchange, so many promises,\nprotestations, oaths.\n\nThe mothers, fearful and fussy, look for their sons in among the crowd\nlike hens in search of their chicks; their wizened faces are hard and\nwrinkled like winter apples, they carry huge baskets on their arms,\nover-filled with the last delicacies which their fond, toil-worn hands\nwill prepare for the beloved son for the next three years:--a piece of\nsmoked bacon, a loaf of rye bread, a cake of maize-flour.\n\nThe lads themselves--excited after the dance, and not quite as\nclear-headed as they were before that last cask of Hungarian wine was\ntapped in Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein's cellar--feel the intoxication of the\ndeparture now, the quick good-byes, the women's tears. A latent spirit\nof adventure smothers their sorrow at leaving home.\n\nThe gipsies have struck up a melancholy Magyar folksong; the crowd\nbreaks up in isolated groups, mothers and fathers with their sons\nwhisper in the dark corners of the barn. The father who did his service\nthirty years ago gives sundry good advice--no rebellion, quiet\nobedience, no use complaining or grumbling, the three years are quickly\nover. The mother begs her darling not to give way to drink, and not to\nget entangled with one of the hussies in the towns; women and wine, the\ntwo besetting temptations that assail the Magyar peasant--let the\ndarling boy resist both for his sorrowing mother's sake.\n\nBut the lad only listens with half an ear, his dark eyes roam around the\nbarn in search of the sweetheart; he wants one more protestation of love\nfrom her lips, one final oath of fidelity.\n\nAndor has neither father to admonish him, nor mother to pray over him;\nthe rich uncle Lakatos P\u00c3\u00a1l, with whom he has lived hitherto, does not\ncare enough about him to hang weeping round his neck.\n\nAnd Elsa has given her father and mother the slip, and joined Andor\noutside the barn.\n\nHer blue eyes--tired after fifteen hours of pleasure--blink in the glare\nof the brilliant sun. Andor puts his arm round her waist and she,\nclosing her aching eyes, allows him to lead her away.\n\nAnd now they are wandering down the great dusty high road, beneath the\nsparse shade of the stunted acacias that border it. They feel neither\nheat, nor dust, and say but little as they walk. From behind them,\nmuffled by louder sounds, come the sweet, sad strains of the Magyar\nlove-song, \"Csak egy kis l\u00c3\u00a1ny van a vil\u00c3\u00a1gon.\"\n\n    \"There is but one girl in all the world,\n    And she is my own white dove.\n    Oh! How great must God's love be for me!\n    That He thought of giving you to me.\"\n\n\"Elsa, you will wait for me?\" asked Andor, with deep, passionate anxiety\nat last.\n\n\"I will wait for you, Andor,\" replied the girl simply, \"if the good God\nwill give me the strength.\"\n\n\"The strength, Elsa, will be in yourself,\" he urged, \"if only you love\nme as I love you.\"\n\n\"Three years is such a long time!\" she sighed.\n\n\"I will count the weeks that separate us, Elsa--the days--the hours----\"\n\n\"I, too, will be counting them.\"\n\n\"When I come back I will at once talk with Pali b\u00c3\u00a1csi--he is getting\ntired of managing his property--I know that at times lately he has felt\nthat he needed a rest, and that he means to ask me to see to everything\nfor him. He will give me that nice little house on the Fekete Road, and\nthe mill to look after. We can get married at once, Elsa--when I come\nback.\"\n\nHe talked on somewhat ramblingly, at times incoherently. It was easy to\nsee that he was trying to cheat sorrow, to appear cheerful and hopeful,\nbecause he saw that Elsa was quite ready to give way to tears. It was so\nhard to walk out of fairyland just when she had entered it, and found it\nmore beautiful than anything else in life. The paths looked so smooth\nand so inviting, and fairy forms beckoned to her from afar; it all would\nhave been so easy, if only the good God had willed it so. She thought of\nthe many sins which--in her innocent life--she had committed, and for\nwhich Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius had given her absolution; perhaps if she had been\nbetter--been more affectionate with her mother, more forbearing with her\nfather, the good God would have allowed her to have this happiness in\nfull which now appeared so shadowy.\n\nShe fell to wishing that Andor had not been quite so fine and quite so\nstrong, that his chest had been narrower, or his eyesight less keen.\nWomanlike, she felt that she would have loved him just as much and more,\nif he were less vigorous, less powerful; and in that case the wicked\ngovernment would not want him; he could stay at home and help Pali b\u00c3\u00a1csi\nto look after his lands and his mills, and she could marry him before\nthe spring.\n\nThen the pressure of his arm round her waist recalled her to herself;\nshe turned and met his glowing, compelling eyes, she felt that wonderful\nvitality in him which made him what he was, strong in body and strong in\nsoul; his love was strong because his body was strong, as was his soul,\nhis spirit and his limbs, and she no longer wished him to be weak and\ndelicate, for then it would no longer be Andor--the Andor whom she\nloved.\n\nThe clang of the distant bell chased away Elsa's last hovering dreams.\nAndor did not hear it; he was pressing the girl closer and closer to\nhim, unmindful of his surroundings, unmindful that he was on the high\nroad, and that frequently ox-carts went by laden with people, and that\npassers-by were hurrying now toward the railway station.\n\nTrue that no one took any notice of this young man and maid; everyone\nwas either too much absorbed in the business of the morning, or too much\naccustomed to these final scenes of farewell and tenderness ere the lads\nwent off for their three years' service, to throw more than a cursory\nglance on these two.\n\n\"I love you, Elsa, my dove, my rose,\" Andor reiterated over and over\nagain; \"you will wait for my return, will you not?\"\n\n\"I will wait, Andor,\" replied the girl through her sobs.\n\n\"The thought of you will lighten my nights, and bring sunshine to my\ndreary days. Every morning and every evening when I say my prayers, I\nshall ask my guardian angel to fly over to yours, and to tell him to\nwhisper in your ear that I love you beyond all else on earth.\"\n\n\"We must part now, Andor,\" she said earnestly, \"the second bell has gone\nlong ago.\"\n\n\"Not yet, Elsa, not yet,\" he pleaded; \"just walk as far as that next\nacacia tree. There no one will see us, and I want one more kiss before I\ngo.\"\n\nShe never thought to resist him, since her own heart was at one with his\nwish, and he was going away so soon and for so long. So they walked as\nfar as the next acacia tree, and there he took her in his arms and\nkissed her on the cheeks, the eyes, the lips.\n\n\"God alone knows, Elsa,\" he said, and now his own voice was choked with\nsobs, \"what it means to me to leave you. You are the one woman in the\nworld for me, and I will thank the good God on my knees every day of my\nlife for the priceless blessing of your love.\"\n\nAfter that they walked back hand in hand. They had wandered far, and in\na quarter of an hour the train would be starting. It meant a week in\nprison in Arad for any recruit to miss the train, and Andor did mean to\nbe brave and straight, and to avoid prison during the three years.\n\nThe gipsy musicians had carried their instruments over to the railway\nstation; here they had ensconced themselves in full view of the train\nand were playing one after the other the favourite songs of those who\nwere going away.\n\nWhen Andor and Elsa reached the station the crowd in and around it was\ndense, noisy and full of animation and colour. A large batch of recruits\nwho had come by the same train from more distant villages had alighted\nat Marosfalva and joined in the bustle and the singing. They had got\nover the pang of departure from home half an hour or an hour ago; they\nhad already left the weeping mothers and sweethearts behind, so now they\nset to with a will in true Hungarian fashion to drown regrets and stifle\nunmanly tears by singing their favourite songs at the top of their rough\nvoices, and ogling those girls of Marosfalva who happened to be\nunattached.\n\nThe captain in command, with his lieutenant, was pacing up and down the\nstation platform. He now gave a command to a couple of sergeants, and\nthe entraining began. Helter-skelter now, for it was no use losing a\ngood seat whilst indulging in a final kiss or tear. There was a general\nstampede for the carriages and trucks; the recruits on ahead, behind\nthem the trail of women, the mothers with their dark handkerchiefs tied\nround their heads, the girls with pale, tear-stained faces, their\npetticoats of many colours swinging round their shapely hips as they\nrun, the fathers, the brothers.\n\nHere comes Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius, who has finished saying his mass just in\ntime to see the last of his lads. He has tucked his soutane well up\nunder his sash, and he is running across the platform, his rubicund,\nkindly face streaming with excitement.\n\n\"Pater! Pater! Here!\"\n\nA score of voices cry to him from different carriages, and he hurries\non, grasping each rough, hot hand as it is extended out to him.\n\n\"Bless you, my children,\" he cries, and the large, red cotton\nhandkerchief wanders surreptitiously from his nose to his eyes. \"Bless\nyou and keep you.\"\n\n\"Be good lads,\" he admonishes earnestly, \"remember your confession and\nthe holy sacraments! No drinking!\"\n\n\"Oh, Pater!\" comes in protesting accents all around him.\n\n\"Well! not more than is good for you. Abstinence on Fridays--a regular\nconfession and holy communion and holy mass on Sundays will help to keep\nyou straight before the good God.\"\n\nThere's the last bell! Clang! clang! In two minutes comes the horn, and\nthen we are off. The gipsies are playing the saddest of sad songs, it\nseems as if one's heartstrings were being wrenched out of one's body.\n\n\"_There is but one girl in all the world!_\"\n\nFor each lad only one girl!--and she is there at the foot of the\ncarriage-steps, a corner of her ribbon or handkerchief or cotton\npetticoat stuffed into her mouth, to keep her from bursting into sobs.\nThe mothers now are dry-eyed and silent. They look with dull, unseeing\ngaze on this railway train, the engine, the carriages, which will take\ntheir lads away from them. Many have climbed up on the steps of the\ncarriages, hanging on to the handrails, so as to be near the lads as\nlong as possible. Their position is a perilous one, the sergeants as\nwell as the railway officials have to take hold of them by the waist and\nto drag them forcibly down to the ground before they will give way.\n\nIt is the mothers who are the most obstinate. They cling to the\nhandrails, to the steps, even to the wheels--there will be a fearful\naccident if they are not driven off by force. And they will yield only\nto force; guards and porters take hold of them by the waist and drag\nthem away from their perilous positions.\n\nThey fight with stolid obstinacy; they will hang on to the train--they\nare the mothers, you see!--and yet from where they are they cannot\nalways see their sons, herded in with forty or fifty other lads in a\ntruck, some standing, some squatting on the ground, or on the provision\nbaskets. But if you cannot see your son, it is always something to be on\nthe step of the train which is about to take him away.\n\nThe lads are all singing now at the top of their voices, but down below\non the platforms there is but little noise; the mothers do not speak,\nbecause they are fighting for places on the steps of the\nrailway-carriages, where the boys are; they press their lips tightly\ntogether, and when a guard or a porter comes to drag them away they just\nhit out with their elbows--stolidly, silently.\n\nThe fathers and the other older men stand about in groups, leaning on\ntheir sticks, talking in whispers, recounting former experiences of\nentraining, or recruiting, of those abominable three years; and the\nyoung girls--the sweethearts, the sisters, the friends--dare not speak\nfor fear they should break down and help to unman the lads.\n\nAndor, by dint of fighting and obstinacy, has kept his place in the door\nof one of the carriages; he sits on the floor, with his feet down on the\nstep below, and refuses to quit his position for anyone. Several lads\nfrom the rear have tried to throw him out or to drag him in, but Andor\nis mightily strong--you cannot move him if he be not so minded.\n\nElsa, sitting on the step lower down, is resting her elbow on his knee.\nThere is no thought of hiding their love for one another; let the whole\nvillage know it, or the whole countryside, they do not care; they are\nnot going to deprive themselves of these last few minutes--these\nheaven-born seconds, whilst their hands can still meet, their eyes can\nspeak the words which their lips no longer dare frame.\n\n\"I love you!\"\n\n\"You will wait for me?\"\n\nIn those few words lies all the consolation for the present, all the\nhope of the future. With these words engraved upon heart and memory they\ncan afford to look more serenely upon these blank and dreary three\nyears.\n\nIt was as well to have spoken them; as well to have actually put into\nwords what they had already known in their hearts long ago. Now they can\nafford to wait, and Andor will do it with confidence, he is a man and he\nis free. He viewed the future as a master views his slave; the future is\nhis to do with what he likes, to mould, to shape in accordance with his\nwill.\n\nThe land which must one day be his, and Elsa his already! Andor almost\nfell to wishing that the train would start quickly--so many seconds\nwould have been lived of those three intervening years.\n\nElsa tries to look as full of hope as he does; she is only a woman, and\nthe future is not hers to make at will. She is not the conqueror, the\nlord and king of her own destiny; there are so many difficulties in the\npath of her life which she would like to forget at this moment, so as\nnot to embitter the happiness which has come to her; there is her\nshiftless mother and vagabond father, there is the pressure of poverty\nand filial duty--it is easy for Andor--he is a man!\n\n\"You will wait for me, Elsa?\" Andor asks for the twentieth time, and for\nthe twentieth time her lips murmur an assent, even though her heart is\nheavy with foreboding.\n\nThere goes the horn!\n\n\"Elsa, my love, one more kiss,\" cries Andor, as he presses her closely,\never more closely to his heart. \"God bless you, my rose! You _will_ wait\nfor me?\"\n\nThe engine gives a shrill whistle. All the men now--realizing the\ndanger--drag their women-folk away from the slowly-revolving wheels. The\ngipsy musicians strike up the first spirited bars of the R\u00c3\u00a1k\u00c3\u00b3czy March,\nas with much puffing and ponderous creakings and groanings the\nheavily-laden train with its human freight steams away from the little\nstation.\n\n\"My son! my son!\"\n\n\"Benk\u00c3\u00b3! my son!\"\n\n\"J\u00c3\u00a1nos!\"\n\n\"Endre!\"\n\nA few heartrending cries as each revolution of the wheels takes the lads\na little further away from their homes.\n\n\"Elsa, you will wait for me?\" comes as a final, appealing cry from\nAndor.\n\nHe stands in the door of the carriage, which he holds wide open, and\nthrough a mist of tears which he no longer tries to suppress he sees\nElsa standing there, quite still--a small image of beauty and of sorrow.\nThe sun glints upon her hair, it shines and sparkles like living gold;\nher hands are clasped tightly together, and with her full, many-hued\npetticoats round her slim waist and tiny red-shod feet she looks like a\nflower.\n\nThe crowd below moves alongside of the train--for the first minute or so\nthey all keep up with it, close to the carriage at the door of which can\nstill be seen the head of son or brother or sweetheart. But now the\nengine puts on more speed, the wheels revolve more quickly--some of the\ncrowd fall away, unable to run so fast.\n\nOnly the mothers try to keep up--the old women, some of them\nbare-footed, stolid, looking straight before them--hardly looking at the\ntrain, just running .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. alongside the train first of all, then they\nmust needs fall back--but still they run along the metals, even though\nthe train moves away so quickly now that soon even a mother could not\ndistinguish her son's head, like a black pin-point leaning out of the\ncarriage window.\n\nSo they run:--one or two women run thus for over a kilom\u00c3\u00a8tre, they run\nlong after the train has disappeared from view.\n\nBut Elsa stood quite still. She did not try to run after the train.\n\nThrough the noise of the puffing engine, the final cries of farewell,\nthrough all the noise and the bustle, Andor's cry rose above all, his\nfinal appeal to her to be true:\n\n\"Elsa! you will wait for me?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\"Now that he is dead.\"\n\n\nStranger, if you should ever be driving on the main road between Szeged\nand Arad, tell your driver to pull up at the village of Marosfalva; its\none broad street runs inland at right angles from the road; you will\nthen have on your right two or three bits of meadowland overshadowed by\nwillow trees, which slope down to the Maros; beyond the Maros lies the\ngreat plain--the fields of maize and pumpkin, of hemp and sunflower. And\nwho knows what lies beyond the fields?\n\nBut on your left will be the village of Marosfalva with the wayside inn\nand public bar, kept by Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein, standing prominently at the\ncorner immediately facing you. Two pollarded acacias are planted near\nthe door of the inn, above the lintel of which a painted board scribbled\nover with irregular lettering invites the traveller to enter. A wooden\nverandah, with tumble-down roof and worm-eaten supporting beams, runs\nalong two sides of the house, and from the roof hang a number of\ngaily-coloured and decorated earthenware pots and jars.\n\nThe open space in front of the inn and the whole of the length of the\none street of Marosfalva are very dusty and dry in the summer, in the\nautumn and spring they are a sea and river of mud, and in the winter the\nsnow hides the deep, frozen crevasses; but place and street are as God\nmade them, and it is not man's place to interfere. To begin with, the\ncattle and geese and pigs must all pass this way on their way to the\nwater, so of course it is impossible to do anything with the ground even\nif one were so minded.\n\nThe inn is the only house in Marosfalva which boldly faces the street,\nall the others seem to be looking at it over their shoulders, the front\nof one house facing the back of its neighbour, with a bit of garden or\nyard between, and so on, the whole kilom\u00c3\u00a8tre length of the street.\n\nBut each house has its wooden verandah, which shields the living rooms\nagainst the glare of the sun in summer, and shelters them from snow and\nrain in winter. These wooden verandahs are in a greater or lesser state\nof repair and smartness, and under the roof of every verandah hang rows\nof the same quaintly-decorated and picturesque earthenware jars.\n\nRound every house, too, there are groups of gay sunflowers and of dull\ngreen hemp, and the roofs, thatched with maize-stalks, are ornamented\nalong the top with wooden carvings which stand out clear and fantastic\nagainst the intense blue of the sky.\n\nThen, stranger, if you should alight at the top of the street and did\nwander slowly down its dusty length, you will presently see it widen out\njust in front of the church. It stands well there, doesn't it?--at one\nend of this open place, with its flat, whitewashed fa\u00c3\u00a7ade and\ntower--red-roofed and crowned with a metal cross that glints in the\nsun--the whole building so like in shape to a large white hen, with head\nerect and crimson comb and wings spread out flat to the ground.\n\nThe presbytery is close by--you cannot miss it. It is a one-storied\nhouse, with a row of green-shuttered windows along the front and at the\nside a low gate which leads to a small garden at the back, and over\nwhich appears a vista of brilliant perennials and a stiff row of purple\nasters.\n\nThere is the tiny school-house, too, which in the late summer is made\nvery gay in front with vividly coloured dahlias--an orgy of yellow and\nbrick-red, of magenta and orange.\n\nIf your driver has come along with you down the street, he will point\nout to you the house of Barna Jen\u00c3\u00b6--mayor of the Commune of\nMarosfalva--a personage of vast consideration in the village--a\nconsideration which he shares with H\u00c3\u00b3h\u00c3\u00a9r Alad\u00c3\u00a1r, who is the village\njustice of the peace, and with Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la, who is my lord the Count's\nbailiff.\n\nThen lower down, beyond the church, is the big barn belonging to Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz\nGoldstein, where on special occasions, as well as on fine Sunday\nafternoons, the young folk meet for their simple-hearted, innocent\namusements--for their dancing, their singing and their courtships, and\nfurther on still are the houses of the poorer peasants--of men like\nKapus Benk\u00c3\u00b3 who has never saved a fill\u00c3\u00a9r and until lately, when he was\nstricken down with illness, had to work as a day labourer for wage,\ninstead of owning a bit of land of his own and planting it up for his\nown enjoyment. Here the houses are much smaller and squalid-looking:\nthey have no verandahs--only a narrow door and tiny, diminutive windows\nwhich are not made to open and shut. The pieces of ground around them\nare also planted, like the others, with hemp and with sunflowers, but\neven these look less majestic, less prosperous than those which surround\nthe houses higher up the streets; their brown heads are smaller, more\nsparsely laden with the good oil-bearing seeds, and the stems of the\nhemp do not look as if they ever would make a thatch.\n\nThe street itself is wide and a regular heat-trap in summer: in the\nautumn and the spring it is ankle-deep in mud, and of course in the\nwinter it is buried in snow. But in the late summer it is at its best,\none or two heavy showers of rain have laid the dust, and the sunflowers\nand dahlias round the little school-house and by the presbytery are very\ngay--such a note of crude and vivid colour which even puts the decorated\njars to shame.\n\nAlso the sun has lost some of its unbearable heat; after four o'clock in\nthe afternoon it is pleasant to sit or stand outside one's house for a\nbit of gossip with a neighbour. The brown-legged, black-eyed children,\ncoolly clad in loose white shifts, bare-footed and bare-headed, can play\noutside now; the little girls, with bright-coloured kerchiefs tied round\ntheir heads, and pink or blue petticoats round their waists, vie with\nthe dahlias in hue.\n\nOn Sunday afternoons it is cool enough to dance in Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein's\nbarn. The black day in the calendar--the fourteenth of September--has\ncome and gone, and the lads have gone with it: except for the weeping\nmothers and sweethearts the ordinary village life has resumed its\npeaceful course. But then, there are every year a few weeping mothers\nand sweethearts in Marosfalva or Kender or G\u00c3\u00b6rcz, just as there is\neverywhere else: the lads have to go and do their military service as\nsoon as they come of age.\n\nAnd then others come back about this time, those who have completed\ntheir three years, and they must be made welcome with dancing and\nmusic--the things which a Hungarian peasant loves best in all the world.\n\nAnd as the days are still long and the evenings warm there are the\nstrolls hand-in-hand, arm-in-arm--after the dancing--up the village\nstreet as far as the slowly-flowing Maros. One or two of the lads who\nhave come home after three years have found their sweethearts waiting\nfor them--but only one or two. Three years is a long, long time! Girls\ncannot afford to wait for husbands while their youth and good looks fly\naway so quickly. And the lads, too, are fickle; some of them have\napparently forgotten amongst the more showy, more lively beauties of\ngarrison towns, the doe-eyed girl to whom they had promised faith. They\nare ready, as soon as they come back, for new courtships, fresh\nlove-making, another girl--with blue eyes this time, and fair hair\ninstead of brown.\n\nThen, of course, there are those who never will come back. That awful,\nmysterious place called Bosnia has swallowed them up. There was\nfighting, it seems, in Bosnia, and many were killed: two lads from\nMarosfalva, one from Fekete and two from Kender.\n\nBosnia must belong to the Crown of Hungary--whatever that may mean--the\npoliticians say so, anyhow, and in order that the Crown of Hungary\nshould have what rightly belongs to it the lads from our villages have\nto fight and get killed.\n\n\"Is that just, I ask you?\" so the mothers argue.\n\nThe sweethearts weep for awhile and then cast about for fresh fish out\nof the waters of Life. Sometimes there are mistakes: lads who have been\nreported killed turn up at the village on the appointed day, either hale\nand hearty or maimed and crippled. In either case they are welcome. But\nat times the mistake is the other way: no black report has come; the\nmothers, the fathers, the sweethearts, expect the young soldier home--he\ndoes not come. The others return on a given day--they arrive by\ntrain--Laczi or Benk\u00c3\u00b3 or P\u00c3\u00a1l is not amongst them. Where is he? Well!\nthey were not all in the same regiment; they have seen little or\nnothing of one another during these three years.\n\nThe anxious mothers rush to Barna Jen\u00c3\u00b6--the mayor--and he drafts a\nletter of inquiry which is duly sent off to the proper authorities at\nBudapest. In the course of time--not very promptly--the reply comes. A\nletter of condolence, curtly worded: the name of Laczi or Benk\u00c3\u00b3 or P\u00c3\u00a1l,\nas the case may be, was inadvertently omitted from the list of killed\nafter the skirmish near Banialuka.\n\nSometimes also the young soldier having received his discharge, does not\ncare to return to his native village: he has lost his taste for pigs and\ngeese, for digging and sowing; he has had a glimpse of life and wants to\nsee some more; the emigration agents at Budapest are active and\npersuasive. \"America is a land of gold,\" they say; \"no further trouble\nbut to stoop and pick up the gold just where it lies.\"\n\nAnd the lad listens and ponders. He will not go home, for he is afraid\nthat his mother's tears will deter him from his purpose: he follows the\nadvice of the emigration agent, expends his last fill\u00c3\u00a9r, sells his spare\nshirt and takes passage at Fiume on a big ship which conveys him to the\nland of riches.\n\nOh! Those lads who go away like that come back sure enough! Broken in\nhealth and spirits, dying of that relentless and mysterious disease\ncalled \"homesickness,\" they drift back after a few years to their\nvillages, having amassed a little money perhaps, but having lost that\nvitality, that love of life and of enjoyment which is the characteristic\nof these sons of Hungary--the land of warmth and of sunshine, of\ngenerous wines and luscious corn.\n\nAnd Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la, walking arm-in-arm with Kapus Elsa on that warm Sunday\nafternoon, had talked much of Andor and of his untoward fate.\n\nThe two young people had met outside the church after Benediction, they\nhad strolled down as far as the Maros and back again into the village.\n\nThe warm late September sunshine shed a golden glow upon the thatched\nroofs of the cottages and made every bright-coloured pot that hung under\nthe verandahs gleam with many-hued and dazzling reflections. It touched\nthe red roof of the little church with an additional coat of glittering\ncrimson and caused the metal cross upon the spire to throw out vivid\nsparks of light.\n\nThe festive air of a Sunday afternoon hung upon the village street, men\nand maids walked by arm-in-arm, the girls in their finery with cotton\npetticoats swinging out, and high-heeled boots clinking as they walked,\nthe men with round felt hats tilted rakishly over one eye, their bronzed\nfaces suffused in smiles, the song never for long absent from their\nlips.\n\nFrom the top of the street a flock of geese in charge of a diminutive\nmaiden of ten was slowly waddling down toward the stream, shaking their\ngrey and white feathers under the hot kiss of the sun, and behind them,\nin slow majesty, a herd of cows and oxen--snow-white, with graceful,\ntall horns, lyre-shaped and slender--ambled lazily along.\n\nElsa and B\u00c3\u00a9la had paused outside the house of H\u00c3\u00b3h\u00c3\u00a9r Alad\u00c3\u00a1r--who was the\nvillage justice of the peace and husband to Ilona, B\u00c3\u00a9la's only sister.\n\nA mightily rich man was H\u00c3\u00b3h\u00c3\u00a9r Alad\u00c3\u00a1r, and Ilona was noted for being the\nmost thrifty housewife in a country where most housewives are thrifty,\nand for being a model cook in a land where good cooks abound.\n\nHer house was a pattern of orderliness and cleanliness: always\nimmaculately whitewashed outside and the little shutters painted a vivid\ngreen, it literally shone with dazzling brightness on these hot summer\nafternoons. The woodwork of the verandah was elaborately carved, the\npots that hung from the roof had not a chip or crack in them.\n\nNo wonder that Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la was proud of these housewifely qualities in his\nonly sister, and that he loved to make a display of them before his\nfianc\u00c3\u00a9e whose own mother was so sadly lacking in them.\n\nNow he pushed open the front door and stood aside to allow Elsa to\nenter, and as she did so the sweet scent of rosemary and lavender\ngreeted her nostrils; she looked round her with unfeigned appreciation,\nand a little sigh--hardly of envy but wholly wistful--escaped her lips.\nThe room was small and raftered and low, but little light came through\nthe two small windows, built one on each side of the front door, but\neven in the dim light the furniture shone with polish, and the wooden\nfloor bore every sign of persistent and vigorous scrubbing. There was a\ncloth of coloured linen upon the centre table, beautifully woven in a\nchess-board pattern of red and blue by Ilona's deft hands. The pewter\nand copper cooking utensils on and about the huge earthenware stove were\nresplendently bright, and the carved oak dower-chest--with open\nlid--displayed a dazzling wealth of snow-white linen--hand-woven and\nhand-embroidered--towels, sheets, pillow-cases, all lying in beautiful\nbundles, neatly tied with red ribbons and bows.\n\nAgain Elsa sighed--in that quaint, wistful little way of hers. If her\nmother had been as thrifty and as orderly as Ilona, then mayhap her own\nmarriage with Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la need never have come about. She could have\nmourned for Andor quietly by herself, and the necessity of a wealthy\nson-in-law would probably never have presented itself before her\nmother's mind.\n\nBut now she followed Ilona into the best bedroom, the sanctum sanctorum\nof every Hungarian peasant home--the room that bears most distinctly the\nimpress of the housewifely character that presides over it. And as Elsa\nstood upon the threshold of her future sister-in-law's precious domain,\nshe forgot her momentary sadness in the hope of a brighter future, when\nshe, too, would make her new home orderly and sweet-scented, with\nbeautifully-polished furniture and floors radiant with cleanliness. The\nthought of what her own best bedroom would be like delighted her fancy.\nIt was a lovely room, for B\u00c3\u00a9la's house was larger by far than his\nsister's, the rooms were wider and more lofty, and the windows had\nlarge, clear panes of glass in them. She would have two beautiful\nbedsteads in the room, and the bedspreads would be piled up to the\nceiling with down pillows and duvets covered in scarlet twill; she would\nhave two beautiful spreads of crochet-work, a washstand with marble top,\nand white crockery, and there would be a stencilling of rose garlands on\nthe colour-washed walls.\n\nSo now her habitual little sigh was not quite so wistful as it had been\nbefore; the future need not after all be quite so black as she sometimes\nfeared, and surely the good God would be kind to her in her married\nlife, seeing that she obeyed His commandment and honoured her mother by\ndoing what her mother wished.\n\nIlona in the best bedroom was busy as usual with duster and brush. She\ndid not altogether approve of B\u00c3\u00a9la's choice of a wife, and her greetings\nof Elsa were always of a luke-warm character, and were usually\naccompanied by lengthy lectures on housewifery and the general\nmanagement of a kitchen.\n\nElsa always listened deferentially to these lectures, with eyes downcast\nand an attitude of meekness; but in her own heart she was thankful that\nher future home would lie some distance out of the village and that\nIlona would probably have but little time to walk out there very often.\n\nIn the meanwhile, however, she hated these Sunday afternoon visits, with\ntheir attendant homilies from Ilona first, then from Alad\u00c3\u00a1r--who was\nself-important and dictatorial, and finally from B\u00c3\u00a9la, who was\ninvariably disagreeable and sarcastic whenever he saw his sister and his\nfianc\u00c3\u00a9e together.\n\nFortunately, to-day B\u00c3\u00a9la had said that she need not stay more than a few\nminutes.\n\n\"We'll just pay our respects to Ilona and Alad\u00c3\u00a1r,\" he had said\npompously, \"and take another walk before the sun goes down.\"\n\nAnd Elsa--taking him at his word--had made but a meteoric appearance in\nher future sister-in-law's cottage--a hasty greeting, a brief peck on\nIlona's two cheeks, and one on Alad\u00c3\u00a1r's bristly face, then the\ninevitable homily; and as soon as Ilona paused in the latter, in order\nto draw breath, Elsa gave her another peck, by way of farewell,\nexplained hastily that her mother was waiting for her, and fled\nincontinently from the rigid atmosphere of the best bedroom.\n\nB\u00c3\u00a9la and his brother-in-law had started on politics, and it took a\nlittle time before Elsa succeeded in persuading him to have that nice\nwalk with her before the sun went down. But now they were out again in\nthe sunshine at last, and Elsa was once more able to breathe freely and\nwith an infinity of relief.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said B\u00c3\u00a9la dryly, \"if you are really taking in all the good\nadvice which Ilona so kindly gives you from time to time. You can't do\nbetter than model yourself on her. She is a pattern wife and makes\nAlad\u00c3\u00a1r perfectly happy. I wonder,\" he reiterated, with something of a\nsneer, \"if you will learn from her, or if your mother's influence will\nremain with you for ever?\"\n\nThen, as with her accustomed gentleness she chose to remain silent,\nrather than resent his sneer, he added curtly:\n\n\"If you want to make me happy and comfortable you will follow Ilona's\nadvice in all things.\"\n\n\"I will do my best, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" she said quietly.\n\nThen for some reason which the young man himself could not perhaps have\nexplained he once more started talking about Andor.\n\n\"It was very hard on him,\" he said, with a shrug of his wide shoulders,\n\"to die just when he was on the point of getting his discharge.\"\n\nAnd after an almost imperceptible moment of hesitation he added with\nstudied indifference: \"Of course, all that talk of his being still alive\nis sheer nonsense. I have done everything that lay in my power to find\nout if there was the slightest foundation for the rumour, but now\nI--like all sensible people--am satisfied that Andor is really dead.\"\n\nElsa was walking beside him, her hand resting lightly on his arm, as was\nfitting for a girl who was tokened and would be a bride within the week:\nshe walked with head bent, her eyes fixed upon the ground. She made no\nimmediate reply to her fiance's self-satisfied peroration, and her\nsilence appeared to annoy him, for he continued with some acerbity:\n\n\"Don't you care to hear what I did on Andor's behalf?\"\n\n\"Indeed I do, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" she said gently, \"it was good of you to worry about\nhim--and you so busy already.\"\n\n\"I did what I could,\" he rejoined mollified. \"Old Lakatos P\u00c3\u00a1l has\nhankered after him so, though he cared little enough about Andor at one\ntime. Andor was his only brother's only child, and I suppose Pali\nb\u00c3\u00a1csi[3] was suddenly struck with the idea that he really had no one to\nleave his hoardings to. He was always a fool and a lout. If Andor had\nlived it would have been all right. I think Pali b\u00c3\u00a1csi was quite ready\nto do something really handsome for him. Now that Andor is dead he has\nno one; and when he dies his money all goes to the government. It is a\npity,\" he added, with a shrug of the shoulders. \"If a peasant of\nMarosfalva had it it would do good to the commune.\"\n\n[Footnote 3: See footnote on p. 22.]\n\n\"I am sure if Andor had lived to enjoy it he would have spent it freely\nand done good with it to everyone around,\" she said quietly.\n\n\"He would have spent it freely, right enough,\" he retorted dryly, \"but\nwhether he would have done good to everyone around with it--I doubt me\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. to Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein, perhaps .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"B\u00c3\u00a9la, you must not say that,\" she broke in firmly; \"you know that Andor\nnever was a drunkard.\"\n\n\"I never suggested that he was,\" retorted B\u00c3\u00a9la, whose square, hard face\nhad become a shade paler than before, \"so there is no reason for my\nfuture wife to champion him quite so hotly as you always do.\"\n\n\"I only spoke the truth.\"\n\n\"If someone else spoke of me a hundred times more disparagingly than I\never do of Andor would you defend me as warmly, I wonder, as you do\nhim?\"\n\n\"Don't let us quarrel about Andor,\" she rejoined gently, \"it does not\nseem right now that he is dead.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\"Love will follow.\"\n\n\nThey had reached the small cottage where old Kapus and his wife and Elsa\nlived. It stood at the furthest end of the village, away from the main\nroad, and the cool meadows beside the Maros, away from the church and\nthe barn and all the brightest spots of Marosfalva. Built of laths and\nmud, it had long ago quarrelled with the whitewash which had originally\ncovered it, and had forcibly ejected it, showing deep gaps and fissures\nin its walls; the pots and jars which hung from the overhanging thatch\nwere all discoloured and broken, and the hemp which hung in bundles\nbeside them looked uneven and dark in colour, obviously beaten with a\nslipshod, careless hand.\n\nSuch a contrast to the house of H\u00c3\u00b3h\u00c3\u00a9r Alad\u00c3\u00a1r--the rich justice of the\npeace and of Ilona his wife! Elsa knew and expected that the usual\nhomily on the subject would not fail to be forthcoming as it did on\nevery Sunday afternoon; she only wondered what particular form it would\ntake to-day, whether B\u00c3\u00a9la would sneer at her and her mother for the\ntumble-down look of the verandah, for the bad state of the hemp, or the\ncoating of dirt upon the earthenware pots.\n\nBut it was the hemp to-day.\n\n\"Why don't you look after it, Elsa?\" said B\u00c3\u00a9la roughly, as he pointed to\nthe tangled mass of stuff above him, \"your mother ruins even the sparse\ncrop which she has.\"\n\n\"I can't do everything,\" said Elsa, in that same gentle, even voice\nwhich held in its tones all the gamut of hopeless discouragement; \"since\nfather has been stricken he wants constant attention. Mother won't give\nit him, so I have to be at his beck and call. Then there is the washing\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" broke in B\u00c3\u00a9la with a sneer, \"you need not always\nremind me that my future wife--the bride of my lord the Count's own\nbailiff--does menial work for a village schoolmistress and a snuffy old\npriest!\"\n\nElsa made no reply. She pushed open the door of the cottage and went in;\nB\u00c3\u00a9la followed her, muttering between his teeth.\n\nThe interior of Kapus Benk\u00c3\u00b3's home was as squalid, as forlorn looking as\nits approach; everywhere the hand of the thriftless housewife was\npainfully apparent, in the blackened crockery upon the hearth, in the\ndull, grimy look of the furniture--once so highly polished--in the\ntattered table-cloth, the stains upon the floor and the walls, but above\nall was it apparent in the dower-chest--that inalienable pride of every\nthrifty Hungarian housewife--the dower-chest, which in Ilona's cottage\nwas such a marvel of polish outside, and so glittering in its rich\ncontents of exquisite linen. But here it bore relentless if mute\ntestimony to the shiftless, untidy, disorderly ways of the Kapus\nhousehold. For instead of the neat piles of snow-white linen it was\nfilled with rubbish--with husks of maize and mouldy cabbage-stalks,\nthrown in higgledy-piggledy with bundles of clothes and rags of every\nsort and kind.\n\nIt stood close to the stove, the smoke of which had long ago covered the\nwood with soot. The lid was thrown open and hung crooked upon a broken\nhinge.\n\nWhen Elsa entered the cottage with Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la her mother was busy with\nsome cooking near the hearth, and smoke and the odour of _guly\u00c3\u00a1s_ (meat\nstew) filled the place. Close to the fire in an armchair of polished\nwood sat old Kapus Benk\u00c3\u00b3, now a hopeless cripple. The fate which lies in\nwait in these hot countries for the dissolute and the drunkard had\nalready overtaken him. He had had a stroke a couple of years ago, and\nthen another last summer. Now he could not move hand or foot, his tongue\nrefused him service, he could only see and hear and eat. Otherwise he\nwas like a log: carried from his palliasse on which he slept at night to\nthe armchair in which he sat all day. Elsa's strong young arms carried\nhim thus backwards and forwards, she ministered to him, nursed him, did\nwhat cheering she could to brighten his days that were an almost\nperpetual night.\n\nAt sight of Elsa his wrinkled face, which was so like that of a corpse,\nbrightened visibly. She ran to him and said something in his ear which\ncaused his dulled eyes to gleam with momentary pleasure.\n\n\"What did you bring B\u00c3\u00a9la home with you for?\" said the mother\nungraciously, speaking to her daughter and rudely ignoring the young\nman, who had thrown his hat down and drawn one of the chairs close to\nthe table. At Kapus Irma's inhospitable words he merely laughed and\nshrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Well, Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni!\" he said, \"this is the last Sunday, anyhow, that you\nwill be troubled with my presence. After Wednesday, as I shall have Elsa\nin my own home, I shall not need to come and visit here.\"\n\n\"No!\" retorted Irma, with a snap of her lean jaws, \"you will take good\ncare to alienate her from her duty to her father and to her mother,\nwon't you?\"\n\nThen, in answer to a further sneer from him, she added, more viciously:\n\"You will teach her to be purse-proud like yourself--vain, and\ndisdainful of her old home.\"\n\nB\u00c3\u00a9la's one eye--under the distorted brow--wandered with a sullen\nexpression of contempt over every individual piece of furniture in the\nroom.\n\n\"It's not a home to be proud of, anyway,\" he said dryly; \"is it, Irma\nn\u00c3\u00a9ni?\"\n\n\"You chose your future wife out of it,\" retorted Irma; \"and 'tis from\nhere that you will have to fetch her on Wednesday, my friend.\"\n\nShe was always ready to quarrel with B\u00c3\u00a9la, whose sneering ways she\nresented, all the more that she knew they were well-deserved. But her\nlast words had apparently poured oil over the already troubled waters of\nthe young man's wrath, for now his sullen expression vanished, and a\nlight of satisfaction and of pride lit up his ungainly face:\n\n\"And I will fetch my future wife in a style befitting her new position,\nyou may be sure of that,\" he said, and brought his clenched fist down\nupon the table with a crash, so that pots and pans rattled upon the\nhearth and started the paralytic from his torpor.\n\nThen he threw his head back and began to talk still more arrogantly and\ndefiantly than he had done hitherto.\n\n\"Forty-eight oxen,\" he said, \"shall fetch her in six carts! Aye! even\nthough she has not one stick of furniture wherewith to endow her future\nhusband. Forty-eight oxen, I tell you, Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni! Never has there been\nsuch a procession seen in Marosfalva! But Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la is the richest man\nin the Commune,\" he added, with an aggressive laugh, \"and don't you\nforget it.\"\n\nBut the allusion to Elsa's poverty and his own riches had exasperated\nthe old woman.\n\n\"With all your riches,\" she retorted, in her turn, with a sneer, \"you\nhad to court Elsa for many years before she accepted you.\"\n\n\"And probably she would not have accepted me at all if you had not\nbullied and worried her, and ordered her to say 'Yes' to me,\" he\nrejoined dryly.\n\n\"Children must obey their parents,\" she said, \"it is the law of God.\"\n\n\"A law which you, for one, apply to your own advantage, eh, Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni?\"\n\n\"Have you any cause for complaint?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! Elsa's obedience has served me well. And though I dare say,\" he\nadded, suddenly casting a sullen look upon the young girl, \"she has not\nmuch love for me now, she will do her duty by me as my wife, and love\nwill follow in the natural course of things.\"\n\nElsa had taken no part in this wordy warfare between her mother and her\nfuture husband. It seemed almost as if she had not heard a word of it.\nNo doubt her ears were trained by now no longer to heed these squabbles.\nShe had drawn a low stool close to the invalid's chair, and sitting near\nhim with her hand resting on his knee, she was whispering and talking\nanimatedly to him, telling him all the gossip of the village, recounting\nto him every small event of the afternoon and of the morning: Pater\nBonif\u00c3\u00a1cius' sermon, the behaviour of the choir boys, Patk\u00c3\u00b3s Emma's new\nkerchief; when the stock of gossip gave out she began to sing to him, in\na low, sweet voice, one of those innumerable folk-songs so dear to every\nHungarian peasant's heart.\n\nIrma intercepted the look which B\u00c3\u00a9la cast upon his fianc\u00c3\u00a9e. She, too,\nturned and looked at her daughter, and seeing her there, sitting at the\nfeet of that miserable wreck of humanity whom she called \"father!\"\nministering to him, for all the world like the angels around the dying\nsaints, a swift look of pity softened for a moment the mother's hard and\npinched face.\n\n\"You cannot expect the girl to have much love for you now,\" she said,\nonce more turning a vicious glance upon her future son-in-law; \"your\nmode of courtship was not very tender, you will admit.\"\n\n\"I don't believe in all that silly love-making,\" he rejoined roughly,\n\"it is good enough for the loutish peasants of the _alf\u00c3\u00b6ld_ (lowlands);\nthey are sentimental and stupid: an educated man does not make use of a\nlot of twaddle when he woos the woman of his choice.\"\n\n\"All men act very much in the same way when they are in love,\" said Irma\nsententiously. \"But I don't believe that you are really in love with\nElsa.\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders, and laughed, a short, sarcastic, almost cruel\nlaugh.\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" he said. \"But I want her for my wife all the same.\"\n\n\"Only because she is the noted beauty of the countryside, and because\nhalf the village wanted her.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" he said with a sneer; \"there was a good deal of bidding for\nElsa, eh, Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni? So you elected to give her to the highest bidder.\"\n\n\"You had been courting her longer than anybody,\" rejoined Irma, who this\ntime chose to ignore his taunt.\n\n\"And I would have won her sooner--on my own--even without your help, if\nit had not been for that accursed Andor.\"\n\n\"Well! he is dead now, anyway. All doubts, I suppose, are at rest on\nthat point.\"\n\n\"There are a few fools still left in the village who maintain that he\nwill turn up some day.\"\n\n\"We all hope he will, because of Lakatos P\u00c3\u00a1l. The poor man is fretting\nhimself into his grave, since he has realized that when he dies his\nmoney and land must all go to the Government.\"\n\n\"He can sell his land and distribute his money while he lives,\" retorted\nB\u00c3\u00a9la; \"but you won't catch him doing that--the old miser.\"\n\n\"Can't anything more be done?--about Andor, I mean.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" he said impatiently; \"everything that could be done has\nbeen done. It's no use going on having rows by post with the War Office\nabout the proofs of a man's death who has been food for worms these past\ntwo years.\"\n\n\"Well! you know, B\u00c3\u00a9la, people here are not satisfied about those proofs.\nI, for one, never held with those who would not believe in Andor's\ndeath; there are plenty of folk in the village--and Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius is\none of them--who swear that he will come home one of these days--perhaps\nwhen Pali b\u00c3\u00a1csi is dead. And then he would find himself the richest man\nin the Commune,\" she added, not without a point of malice, \"richer even\nthan you, my good B\u00c3\u00a9la.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, you old fool!\" broke in B\u00c3\u00a9la savagely, as once more\nthe sinister leer which hovered round his sightless eye was turned\ntoward Elsa.\n\n\"Didn't I say that I, for one, never believed that rubbish?\" retorted\nIrma sullenly; \"and haven't I preached to her about it these past two\nyears? But you needn't be afraid,\" she added, as she turned once more to\nher stewing-pot, \"she didn't hear what I said. When she talks or sings\nto her father you might shoot off a cannon--she wouldn't hear it. You\nmay say what you like just now, B\u00c3\u00a9la, she'll not listen.\"\n\n\"Oho!\" said B\u00c3\u00a9la, even as a curious expression of obstinacy, not unmixed\nwith cruelty, crept into his colourless face, \"you seem to forget, Irma\nn\u00c3\u00a9ni, that the rest of Elsa's life will have to be spent in listening to\nme. We'll soon see about that.\"\n\n\"Elsa!\" he called peremptorily.\n\nThen, as indeed the girl appeared not to hear, but went on softly\ncrooning and singing to the helpless invalid like a mother to its babe,\nthe young man worked himself up into a passion of fury. The veins in his\npale forehead and temples swelled up visibly, the glitter in his one eye\nbecame more cruel and more menacing, finally he brought his clenched\nfist once more crashing down upon the table, even while he rose to his\nfeet, as if to give fuller meaning to his future marital authority.\n\n\"Elsa!\" he shouted once more, hoarsely. \"Elsa, do you hear what I say?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\"I don't wish to marry; not yet.\"\n\n\nThe girl thus roughly apostrophized turned slowly round. She seemed\nneither hurt nor even surprised at the young man's exhibition of temper.\nIn her blue eyes there was a strange look--one which had lately been\nhabitual to her, but which neither her mother nor B\u00c3\u00a9la were able to\ninterpret: it was a look which conveyed the thought of resignation or\nindifference or both, but also one which was peculiarly lifeless, as of\na soul who had touched the cold hand of despair.\n\nFar be it from me to seek complexity in so simple a soul as was that of\nthis young Hungarian peasant girl. Elsa Kapus had no thought of\nself-analysis; complicated sex and soul problems did not exist for her;\nshe would never have dreamed of searching the deep-down emotions of her\nheart and of dragging them out for her mind to scrutinize. The morbid\nmodern craze for intricate and composite emotions was not likely to\nreach an out-of-the-way Hungarian village that slept peacefully on the\nbanks of the sluggish Maros, cradled in the immensity of the plain.\n\nElsa had loved Lakatos Andor--the handsome, ardent young lover whose\nimpetuous courtship of her five years ago had carried her on the wings\nof Icarus to a region so full of brightness and of sunlight that it was\nno wonder that the wings--which had appeared god-like--turned out to be\nephemeral and brittle after all, and that she was soon precipitated\nback and down into the ordinary sea of everyday life.\n\nElsa had never heard of Icarus, but she had felt herself soaring upwards\non heavenly wings when Andor--his lips touching her neck--had whispered\nwith passionate ardour: \"Elsa, I love you!\"\n\nShe had never heard of Icarus' fall, but she had experienced her own\nfrom the giddy heights of heavenly happiness, down to the depths of\ndull, aching despair. The fall had been very gradual--there had been\nnothing grand or heroic or soul-stirring about it: Andor had gone away,\nhaving told her that he loved her, and adjured her to wait for him. She\nhad waited for three years, patiently, quietly, obstinately, despite the\nmany and varied sieges laid to her heart and her imagination by the\ninflammable, eligible youth of the countryside. Elsa Kapus--the\nfar-famed beauty of half the county, counted her suitors by the score.\nPatiently, quietly, obstinately she kept every suitor at bay--even\nthough many were rich and some in high positions--even though her\nmother, with the same patience, the same quietude, and the same\nobstinacy worked hard to break her daughter's will.\n\nBut Andor was coming back. Andor had adjured her to wait for him: and\nElsa was still young--just sixteen when Andor went away. She was in no\nhurry to get married.\n\nNo one, of course, guessed the reason of her obstinate refusal of all\nthe best matrimonial prizes in the county. No one guessed her\nsecret--the depth of her love for Andor--her promise to wait for\nhim--her mother guessed it least of all. Everyone put her stubbornness\ndown to conceit and to ambition, and no one thought any the worse of her\non that account. When she refused young Barna--the mayor's eldest son,\nand Nagy Lajos, the rich pig merchant from Soms\u00c3\u00b3, people shrugged their\nshoulders and said that mayhap Elsa wanted to marry a shopkeeper of Arad\nor even a young noble lord. Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni said nothing for the first year,\nand even for two. She saw Nagy Lajos go away, and young Barna court\nanother girl. That was perhaps as it should be. Elsa was growing more\nbeautiful every year--and there was a noble lord who owned a fine estate\nand a castle close by, who had taken lately to riding over on Sunday\nafternoons to Marosfalva, and paid marked attention to Elsa.\n\nNoble lords had been known to marry peasant girls--at least in books, so\nIrma n\u00c3\u00a9ni had been told, and, of course, one never knows! God's ways\nwere wonderful sometimes.\n\nBut when two years had gone by, when a rich shopkeeper from Arad had\ncome and courted and been refused, and when the noble lord had suddenly\nceased his Sunday afternoon visits to Marosfalva, Irma became more\nanxious. She had a long and serious talk with her daughter, which led to\nno good.\n\nTo all her mother's wise counsels and sound arguments Elsa had opposed\nthe simple statement of facts:\n\n\"I do not wish to marry, mother dear; not just yet.\"\n\nThis, of course, would never do. Irma realized that she had allowed her\nambition for her daughter to run away with her common-sense. Elsa must\nhave got some queer notion or other in her head; that intimacy with the\nschoolmistress--who came from Budapest and talked a vast amount of\nsentimental stuff which she had imbibed out of books--must be stopped at\nonce, and Elsa be taken in hand by her own mother.\n\nTo aim high was quite one thing, but to let every chance, however\nsplendid, slip through one's fingers was the work of a fool.\n\nThe work of taking Elsa in hand was thus promptly undertaken. Fate\nfavoured the mother's intentions: old Kapus was stricken with paralysis,\nand Elsa had, from that hour forth, to spend most of her time with her\nfather in the house, and immediately under her mother's eye.\n\nThough young Barna was married by now, and the pig merchant, the noble\nlord and the rich shopkeeper all gone to seek a sweetheart elsewhere,\nthere were still plenty of suitors dangling round the beauty of the\ncountry-side: in fact her well-known pride and aloofness had brought a\nsurfeit of competitors in the lists. Foremost among these was Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la,\nwho was not only young and in a high position as my lord the Count's\nchief bailiff, but was also reputed to be the richest man for miles\naround.\n\nEr\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la had long ago made public his determination to win Elsa for\nwife, and he had carried on his courtship unostentatiously but persistently\nall along, despite the many rivals in the field. Elsa never disliked\nhim, she accepted his attentions just as she did those of everyone else.\nPeriodically B\u00c3\u00a9la would make a formal proposal of marriage, which Irma\nn\u00c3\u00a9ni, in her own name and that of Elsa's paralytic father, invariably\naccepted. But to his sober and well-worded proposals Elsa gave the same\nreplies that she gave to her more impetuous adorers.\n\n\"I don't want to marry. Not yet!\"\n\nWhen the work of taking Elsa in hand began in earnest, Irma used Er\u00c3\u00b6s\nB\u00c3\u00a9la as her chief weapon of attack. He was very rich, young enough to\nmarry, my lord the Count looked upon him as his right hand--moreover\nB\u00c3\u00a9la had made Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni a solemn promise that if Elsa became his wife,\nhis father and mother-in-law should receive that fine house in the\nKender Road to live in, with a nice piece of garden, three cows and five\npigs, and a little maid-of-all-work to wait upon them.\n\nBacked with such a bargain, B\u00c3\u00a9la's suit was bound to prosper.\n\nAnd yet, for another whole year, Elsa was obstinate. Irma had to resort\nto sterner measures, and in a country like Hungary, where much of the\npatriarchal feeling toward parents still exists, a mother's stern\nmeasures become very drastic indeed. A child is a child while she is\nunder her parents' roof. If she be forty she still owes implicit\nobedience, unbounded respect to them. If she fail in these, she becomes\nan unnatural creature, denounced to her friends as such, under a cloud\nof opprobrium before her tiny, circumscribed world.\n\nKapus Irma brought out the whole armoury of her parental authority, her\nparental power: and her methods could be severe when she chose. I will\nnot say that she ill-treated the girl, though it was more than once that\nElsa's right cheek and ear were crimson when the left were quite pale,\nand that often, on the hot Sundays in July and August, when the girls go\nin low-necked corslets and shifts to church, Elsa wrapped a kerchief\nover her shoulders--the neighbours said in order to hide the corrections\ndealt by Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni's vigorous hand. But it was morally that her mother's\nauthority weighed most heavily upon the girl. Her commands became more\ndefined, and presently more peremptory. Elsa was soon placed in the\nterrible alternative of either being faithless to Andor or disobedient\nto her mother.\n\nAnd it is characteristic of that part of the world that of the two sins\nthus in prospect, the latter seemed by far the more heinous.\n\nYet Andor was due back at the end of the summer. The fourteenth of\nSeptember came and went and the new recruits went with it--another week,\nand those who had completed their three years would be coming home.\nAndor would, of course, be among them. There had come no adverse report\nabout him, and no news during those three years is always counted to be\ngood news. No letters or sign of life had come from him, but, then, many\nof the lads never wrote home while they did their three years, and Andor\nhad no one to write to. He would not be allowed to write to Elsa, or,\nrather, Elsa would never be allowed to receive letters from him, and his\nuncle Lakatos P\u00c3\u00a1l, the old miser, would only be furious with him for\nspending his few fill\u00c3\u00a9rs on note-paper and stamps. But Elsa had waited\npatiently during three years, knowing that though she had no news of\nhim, he would not forget her. She never mistrusted him, she never\ndoubted him.\n\nShe waited for him, and he did not return. At first, his non-appearance\nexcited neither surprise nor comment in the village. Andor had no\nrelations except his uncle Lakatos P\u00c3\u00a1l, who did not care one brass\nfill\u00c3\u00a9r about him: there had been no one to count the years, the months,\nthe days when he would return: there was only Elsa who cared, and she\ndared not say anything at first, for fear of making her mother angry.\n\nBut at the turn of the year Lakatos P\u00c3\u00a1l became ill, and when he got\nworse and worse and the doctor seemed unable to do anything to make him\nwell, he began to talk of his nephew, Andor.\n\nThat is to say, he bewailed the fact that his only brother's only child\nwas dead, and that he--a poor sick man--had no one to look after him.\n\nHe first spoke of this to Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius, who was greatly shocked and\nupset to hear such casual news of Andor's death, and it was only bit by\nbit that he succeeded in dragging fuller particulars out of the sick\nman. It seems that when the lad's regiment was out in Bosnia there was\nan outbreak of cholera among the troops. Andor was one of those who\nsuccumbed. It had all occurred less than a month before his discharge\nwas actually due, in fact these discharges had already been distributed\nto those who were sick, in the hope that the lads would elect to go home\nas soon as they could be moved, and thus relieve the Government of the\nburden and expense of their convalescence.\n\nBut Lakatos Andor had died in the hospital of Slovnitza. An official\nletter announcing his demise was sent to Lakatos P\u00c3\u00a1l, his uncle and sole\nrelative, but Lakatos only threw the letter into a drawer and said\nnothing about it to anybody.\n\nIt was nobody's business, he said. The Government would see to the lad's\nburial, no doubt, but some busy-bodies at Marosfalva might think that it\nwas his--Lakatos'--duty to put up a stone or something to the memory of\nhis nephew: and that sort of nonsense was very expensive.\n\nSo no one in Marosfalva knew that Andor had died of cholera in the\nhospital of Slovnitza until Lakatos P\u00c3\u00a1l became sick, and in his\nloneliness spoke of the matter to Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius.\n\nThen there was universal mourning in the village. Andor had always been\nvery popular: good-looking, as merry as a skylark and a splendid dancer,\nhe was always the life and soul of every entertainment. Girls who had\nflirted with him wept bitter tears, the mothers who thought how rich\nAndor would have been now that old Lakatos was sure to die very\nsoon--sighed deep sighs of regret.\n\nMany there were who never believed that Andor was dead. He was not the\nlad to die of cholera: he might break his neck one day--riding or\ndriving--for he was always daring and reckless--but to lie sick of\ncholera and to die in a hospital?--no, no, that did not seem like Andor.\n\nPresently it became known that the official letter--announcing the\ndeath--had not been quite in order; it was only a rumour--but the rumour\nquickly gained credence, it fitted in with popular sentiment. Pater\nBonif\u00c3\u00a1cius himself, who had seen the letter, declared that the wording\nof it was very curt and vague--much more curt and vague than such\nletters usually were. It seems that there were a great many cases of\ncholera in the isolation hospital at Slovnitza and lists were sent up\ndaily from there to Budapest of new cases, of severe cases, of\ndischarges and of deaths. In one of these lists Andor's name certainly\ndid appear among the dead, and a brief note to that effect had been\nofficially sent to Lakatos. But surely the news should have had\nconfirmation!\n\nWhere was the lad buried?\n\nWho was beside him when he died?\n\nWhere were the few trinkets which he possessed; his mother's\nwedding-ring which he always wore on his little finger?\n\nPater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius wrote to the War Office at Budapest asking for a reply\nto these three questions. He received none. Then he persuaded Barna\nJen\u00c3\u00b6--the mayor--to write an official document. The War Office up at\nBudapest sent an equally official document saying that they had no\nknowledge on those three points: Lakatos Andor was one of those whose\nnames appeared on the list of deaths from cholera at Slovnitza, and that\nwas quite sufficient proof to offer to any reasonable human being.\n\nPater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius sighed in bitter disappointment, Lakatos P\u00c3\u00a1l continued\nto bemoan his loneliness until he succeeded in persuading himself that\nhe had always loved Andor as his own son, and that the lad's supposed\ndeath would presently cause his own.\n\nAnd the neighbours--especially the women--held on to the belief that\nAndor was not dead; they declared that he would return one day to enjoy\nthe good-will of his rich uncle now, to marry a girl of Marosfalva, and\nto look forward to a goodly legacy from Pali b\u00c3\u00a1csi by and by.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\"They are Jews and we are Hungarians.\"\n\n\nBut what of Elsa during this time? What of the sorrow, the alternating\nhope and despair of those weary, weary months? She did not say much, she\nhardly ever cried, but even her mother--hard and unemotional as she\nwas--respected the girl's secret for awhile, after the news was brought\ninto the cottage that Andor was really dead.\n\nEr\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la had brought the news, and Elsa, on hearing it thus blurted out\nin B\u00c3\u00a9la's rough, cruel fashion, had turned deathly pale, ere she\ncontrived to run out of the room and hide herself away in a corner,\nwhere she had cried till she had made herself sick and faint.\n\n\"Have you been blind all these years, Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni?\" Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la had said\nwith his habitual sneer, when Irma threw up her bony hands in hopeless\npuzzlement at her daughter's behaviour. \"Did you not know that Elsa has\nbeen in love with Andor all along?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Irma in her quiet, matter-of-fact tone, \"I did not know it.\nDid you?\"\n\n\"Of course I did,\" he replied dryly; \"but I have also known for the past\nsix months that Andor was dead.\"\n\n\"You knew it?\" exclaimed Irma with obvious incredulity.\n\n\"I have told you so, haven't I?\" he retorted, \"and I am not in the habit\nof lying.\"\n\n\"But how did you come to know it?\"\n\n\"When he did not return last September I marvelled what had happened; I\nwonder no one else did. Then, when Lakatos P\u00c3\u00a1l first became ill--long\neven before he confided in Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius--I made inquiries at the War\nOffice and found out the truth.\"\n\n\"Whatever made you do that?\" asked Irma, with a shrug of the shoulders.\n\"Andor wasn't anything to you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" replied B\u00c3\u00a9la curtly; \"but, you see, I was afraid that\nPali b\u00c3\u00a1csi would die and that Andor would come back and find himself a\nrich man. I should have lost Elsa then, so I was in a hurry to know.\"\n\nIrma once more shrugged her shoulders in her habitual careless,\nshiftless way--shelving, as it were, the whole responsibility of her\nlife, her fate, and her daughter upon some other power than her own\nwill. She cared nothing about these intrigues of B\u00c3\u00a9la's or of anyone\nelse; she only wanted Elsa to make a rich marriage, so that she--the\nmother--might have a happy, comfortable, above all leisurely, old age.\n\nBut she had enough common sense to see that Elsa laboured under the\nweight of a very great sorrow, and while the girl was in such a\ncondition of grief it would be worse than useless to worry her with\nsuggestions of matrimony. Girls had been known to do desperate things if\nthey were overharassed, and Kapus Irma was no fool; she knew what she\nwanted, and her instinct, coupled with her greed and cupidity, showed\nher the best way to get it.\n\nSo she left Elsa severely alone for a time, left her to pursue her\nhousehold duties, to look after her father, to wash and iron the finery\nof the more genteel inhabitants of Marosfalva--the schoolmistress'\nblouses, Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius' surplices. Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la continued in his\nunemotional attentions to her--he was more sure of success than ever.\nHis words of courtship were the drops of water that were ultimately\ndestined to wear away a stone.\n\nElsa, lulled into security by her mother's placidity and B\u00c3\u00a9la's apparent\nsimple friendship, hardly was conscious of the precise moment when the\nsiege against her passive resistance was once more resumed. It was all\nso gradual, so kind, so persuasive: and she had so little to look\nforward to in the future. What did it matter what became of her?--whom\nshe married or where her home would be? She saw more of Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la than\nshe did of anyone else, for Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la was undoubtedly Irma's most\nfavoured competitor. Elsa knew that he was of violent temperament,\ndictatorial and rough; she knew that he was fond of drink, and of the\nsociety of Klara Goldstein, the Jewess, but she really did not care.\n\nShe had kept her promise to Andor, she had waited for him until she knew\nthat he never, never could come back; now she might as well obey her\nmother and put herself right with God, since she cared so little what\nbecame of her.\n\nAnd the beauty of Marosfalva was tokened to Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la in the spring of\nthe following year, and presently it was given out that the wedding\nwould take place on the feast of Holy Michael and All Angels at the end\nof September. Congratulations poured in upon the happy pair, rejoicings\nwere held in every house of note in the village. Everyone was pleased at\nthe marriage, pleased that the noted beauty would still have her home in\nMarosfalva, pleased that Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la's wealth would all remain in the\nplace.\n\nAnd Elsa received these congratulations and attended these rejoicings\nwith unvarying equanimity and cheerfulness. There was nothing morbid or\nself-centred in the girl's attitude. People who did not know--and no\none really did--and who saw her at mass on Sundays or walking\narm-in-arm with B\u00c3\u00a9la in the afternoons would say that she was perfectly\nhappy. Not a radiant bride certainly, not a typical Hungarian\n_menyecske_ whose laughter echoes from end to end of the village, whose\nmerry voice rings all the day, and whose pretty bare feet trot briskly\nup and down from her cottage to the river, or to the church, or to a\nneighbour's house, but an equable, contented bride, a fitting wife for a\nperson of such high consideration as was Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la.\n\nHer manner to him was always equally pleasant, and though the young pair\ndid not exchange very loving glances--at any rate not in public--yet\nthey were never known to quarrel, which was really quite remarkable,\nseeing that B\u00c3\u00a9la's temper had not improved of late.\n\nHe was giving way to drink more than he used to, and there were some\nugly rumours about my lord the Count's dissatisfaction with his\nerstwhile highly-valued bailiff. Many people said that B\u00c3\u00a9la would get\nhis dismissal presently if he did not mend his ways; but then he very\nlikely wouldn't care if he did get dismissed, he was a rich man and\ncould give his full time to cultivating his own land.\n\nThis afternoon, while he was talking with Irma and sullenly watching his\nfuture wife, he appeared to be quite sober, until a moment ago when\nunreasoning rage seized hold of him and he shouted to Elsa in a rough\nand peremptory manner. After that, his face, which usually was quite\npallid, became hotly flushed, and his one seeing eye had a restless,\nquivering look in it.\n\nNor did Elsa's placid gentleness help to cool his temper. When he\nshouted to her she turned and faced him, and said with a pleasant--if\nsomewhat vague smile:\n\n\"Yes, B\u00c3\u00a9la, what is it you want?\"\n\n\"What is it I want?\" he muttered, as he sank back into his chair, and\nresting his elbows on the table he buried his chin in his hands and\nlooked across at the girl with a glowering and sullen look; \"what is it\nI want?\" he reiterated roughly. \"I want to know what has been the matter\nwith you these last two days?\"\n\n\"Nothing has been the matter with me,\" she replied quietly, \"nothing\nunusual, certainly. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Because for the last two days you have been going about with a face on\nyou fit for a funeral, rather than for a wedding. What is it? Let's have\nit.\"\n\n\"Nothing, B\u00c3\u00a9la. What should it be?\"\n\n\"I tell you there is something,\" he rejoined obstinately, \"and what's\nmore I can make a pretty shrewd guess what it is, eh?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" she said simply.\n\n\"I mean that the noted beauty of Marosfalva does me the honour of being\njealous. Isn't that it, now? Oh! I know well enough, you needn't be\nashamed of it, jealousy does your love for me credit, and flatters me, I\nassure you.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" she reiterated more firmly. \"I am\nneither jealous nor ashamed.\"\n\n\"Not ashamed?\" he jeered. \"Oho! look at your flaming cheeks! Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni,\nhaven't you a mirror? Let her see how she is blushing.\"\n\n\"I don't see why she should be jealous,\" interposed Irma crossly, \"nor\nwhy you should be for ever teasing her. I am sure she has no cause to be\nashamed of anything, or of being jealous of anyone.\"\n\n\"But I tell you that she is jealous of Klara Goldstein!\" he maintained.\n\n\"What nonsense!\" protested the mother, while the blush quickly fled\nfrom the young girl's cheeks, leaving them clear and bloodless.\n\n\"I tell you she is,\" he persisted, with wrathful doggedness; \"she has\nbeen sullen and moody these last two days, ever since I insisted that\nKlara Goldstein shall be asked to-morrow to the farewell banquet and the\ndance.\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't see myself why you wanted that Jewess to come,\" said\nIrma dryly.\n\n\"That's nobody's business,\" he retorted. \"I pay for the entertainment,\ndon't I?\"\n\n\"You certainly do,\" she rejoined calmly. \"We couldn't possibly afford to\ngive Elsa her maiden's farewell, and if you didn't pay for the supper\nand the gipsies, and the hire of the schoolroom, why, then, you and Elsa\nwould have to be married without a proper send-off, that's all.\"\n\n\"And a nice thing it would have been! Whoever heard of a girl on this\nside of the Maros being married without her farewell to maidenhood. I am\npaying for the supper and for everything because I want my bride's\nfarewell to be finer and grander than anything that has ever been seen\nfor many kilom\u00c3\u00a8tres round. I have stinted nothing--begrudged nothing. I\nhave given an ox, two pigs and a calf to be slaughtered for the\noccasion. I have given chickens and sausages and some of the finest\nflour the countryside can produce. As for the wine .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. well! all I can\nsay is that there is none better in my lord's own cellar. I have given\nall that willingly. I did it because I liked it. But,\" he added, and\nonce again the look of self-satisfaction and sufficiency gave way to his\nmore habitual sinister expression, \"if I pay for the feast, I decide who\nshall be invited to eat it.\"\n\nIrma apparently had nothing to say in response. She shrugged her\nshoulders and continued to stir the stew in her pot. Elsa said nothing\neither; obedient to the command of her future lord, she had faced him\nand listened to him attentively and respectfully all the while that he\nspoke, nor did her face betray anything of what went on within her soul,\nanything of its revolt or of its wounded pride, while the storm of wrath\nand of sneers thus passed unheeded over her head.\n\nBut B\u00c3\u00a9la, having worked himself up into a fit of obstinate rage, was not\ncontent with Elsa's passive obedience. There had from the first crept\ninto his half-educated but untutored and undisciplined mind the\nknowledge that though Elsa was tokened to him, though she was\nsubmissive, and gentle and even-tempered, her heart did not belong to\nhim. He knew but little about love, believed in it still less: in that\npart of the world a good many men are still saturated with the Oriental\nconception of a woman's place in the world, and even in the innermost\nrecesses of their mind with the Oriental disbelief in a woman's soul;\nbut in common with all such men he had a burning desire to possess every\naspiration and to know every thought of the woman whom he had chosen for\nhis wife.\n\nTherefore now, when in response to his rage and to his bombast Elsa had\nonly silence for him--a silence which he knew must hide her real\nthoughts, he suddenly lost all sense of proportion and of prudence; for\nthe moment he felt as if he could hate this woman whom he had wooed and\nwon despite her resistance, and in the teeth of strenuous rivalry; he\nwas seized with a purely savage desire to wound her, to see her cry, to\nmake her unhappy--anything, in fact, to rouse her from this irritating\napathy.\n\n\"I suppose,\" he said at last, making a great effort to recover his\noutward self-control, \"I suppose that you object to my asking Klara\nGoldstein to come to your farewell feast?\"\n\nThus directly appealed to by her lover, Elsa gave a direct reply.\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" she said.\n\n\"May I ask why?\"\n\n\"A girl's farewell on the eve of her wedding-day,\" she replied quietly,\n\"is intended to be a farewell to her girl friends. Klara Goldstein was\nnever a friend of mine.\"\n\n\"She belongs to this village, anyway, doesn't she?\" he queried, still\ntrying to speak calmly. He had risen to his feet and stood with squared\nshoulders, legs wide apart, and hands buried in the pockets of his\ntightly-fitting trousers. An ugly, ill-tempered, masterful man, who\nshowed in every line of his attitude that he meant to be supreme lord in\nhis own household.\n\n\"Klara Goldstein belongs to this village,\" he reiterated with forced\nsuavity, \"she is my friend, is she not?\"\n\n\"She may be your friend, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" rejoined Elsa gently, \"and she certainly\nbelongs to this village; but she is not one of us. She is a Jewess, not\na Hungarian, like we all are.\"\n\n\"What has her religion to do with it?\" he retorted.\n\n\"It isn't her religion, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" persisted the girl, with obstinacy at\nleast as firm as his own; \"you know that quite well. Though it is an\nawful thing to think that they crucified our Lord.\"\n\n\"Well! that is a good long while ago,\" he sneered; \"and in any case\nKlara and Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein had nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\"No, I know. Therefore I said that religion had nothing to do with it. I\ncan't explain it exactly, B\u00c3\u00a9la, but don't we all feel alike about that?\nHungarians are Hungarians, and Jews are Jews, and there's no getting\naway from that. They are different to us, somehow. I can't say how, but\nthey are different. They don't speak as we do, they don't think as we\ndo, their Sunday is Saturday, and their New Year's day is in September.\nJewesses can't dance the cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s and Jews have a contempt for our gipsy\nmusic and our songs. They are Jews and we are Hungarians. It is\naltogether different.\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders, unable apparently to gainsay this\nunanswerable argument. After all, he too was a Hungarian, and proud of\nthat fact, and like all Hungarians at heart, he had an unexplainable\ncontempt for the Jews. But all the same, he was not going to give in to\na woman in any kind of disagreement, least of all on a point on which he\nhad set his heart. So now he shifted his ground back to his original\ndictum.\n\n\"You may talk as much as you like, Elsa,\" he said doggedly, \"but Klara\nGoldstein is my friend, and I will have her asked to the banquet first\nand the dance afterwards, or I'll not appear at it myself.\"\n\n\"That's clear, I hope?\" he added roughly, as Elsa, in her habitual\npeace-loving way, had made no comment on that final threat.\n\n\"It is quite clear, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" she now said passively.\n\n\"Of course the girl shall be asked, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" here interposed Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni,\nwho had no intention of quarrelling with her wealthy son-in-law. \"I'll\nsee to it, and don't you lose your temper about it. Here! sit down\nagain. Elsa, bring your father's chair round for supper. B\u00c3\u00a9la, do sit\ndown and have a bite. I declare you two might be married already, so\nmuch quarrelling do you manage to get through.\"\n\nBut B\u00c3\u00a9la, as sulky now as a bear with a sore head, refused to stay for\nsupper.\n\n\"I can't bear sullen faces and dark looks,\" he said savagely. \"I'll go\nwhere I can see pleasant smiles and have some fun. I must say, Irma\nn\u00c3\u00a9ni,\" he added by way of a parting shot, as he picked up his hat and\nmade for the door, \"that I do not admire the way you have brought up\nyour daughter. A woman's place is not only to obey her husband, but to\nlook cheerful about it. However,\" he added, with a dry laugh, \"we'll\nsoon put that right after to-morrow, eh, my dove?\"\n\nAnd with a perfunctory attempt at a more lover-like attitude, he turned\nto Elsa, who already had jumped to her feet, and with a pleasant smile\nwas holding up her sweet face to her future lord for a kiss.\n\nShe looked so exquisitely pretty then, standing in the gloomy half-light\nof this squalid room, with the slanting golden sunshine which peeped in\nthrough the tiny west window outlining her delicate silhouette and\ntouching her smooth fair hair with gold.\n\nVanity, self-satisfaction, and mayhap something a little more tender, a\nlittle more selfless, stirred in the young man's heart. It was fine to\nthink that this beautiful prize--which so many had coveted--was his by\nright of conquest. Even the young lord whose castle was close by had\ntold Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la that he envied him his good luck, whilst my lord the\nCount and my lady the Countess had of themselves offered to be present\nat the wedding and to be the principal witnesses on behalf of the most\nbeautiful girl in the county.\n\nThese pleasant thoughts softened B\u00c3\u00a9la's mood, and he drew his fianc\u00c3\u00a9e\nquite tenderly to him. He kissed her on the forehead and on the cheeks,\nbut she would not let him touch her lips. He laughed at her shyness, the\nhappy triumphant laugh of the conqueror.\n\nThen he nodded to Irma and was gone.\n\n\"He is a very good fellow at heart,\" said the mother philosophically,\n\"you must try and humour him, Elsa. He is very proud of you really, and\nthink what a beautiful house you will have, and all those oxen and pigs\nand a carriage and four horses. You must thank God on your knees for so\nmuch good fortune; there are girls in this village who would give away\ntheir ears to be standing in your shoes.\"\n\n\"Indeed, mother dear, I am very, very grateful for all my good fortune,\"\nsaid Elsa cheerfully, as with vigorous young arms she pulled the\nparalytic's chair round to the table and then got him ready for his\nmeal.\n\nAfter which there was a moment's silence. Elsa and her mother each stood\nbehind her own chair: the young girl's clear voice was raised to say a\nsimple grace before a simple meal.\n\nThe stew had not been put on the table, since B\u00c3\u00a9la did not stay for\nsupper. It would do for to-morrow's dinner, and for to-night maize\nporridge and rye bread would be quite sufficient.\n\nElsa looked after her father and herself ate with a hearty, youthful\nappetite. Her mother could not help but be satisfied that the child was\nhappy.\n\nThe philosophy of life had taught Kapus Irma a good many lessons,\nforemost among these was the one which defined the exact relationship\nbetween the want of money and all other earthly ills. Certainly the want\nof money was the father of them all. Elsa in future would never feel it,\ntherefore all other earthly ills would fall away from her for lack of\nsupport.\n\nIt was as well to think that the child realized this, and was grateful\nfor her own happiness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\"I put the bunda away somewhere.\"\n\n\nKapus Irma went out after supper to hold a final consultation with the\nmore influential matrons of Marosfalva over the arrangements for\nto-morrow's feast. Old Kapus had been put to bed on his paillasse in the\nnext room and Elsa was all alone in the small living-room. She had\nwashed up the crockery and swept up the hearth for the night; cloth in\nhand, she was giving the miserable bits of furniture something of a\nrub-down and general furbishing-up: a thing she could only do when her\nmother was away, for Irma hated her to do things which appeared like a\ncomment on her own dirty, slatternly ways.\n\nCleanliness, order and a love of dainty tidiness in the home are marked\ncharacteristics of the true Hungarian peasantry: the cottages for the\nmost part are miracles of brightness, brightly polished floors, brightly\npolished pewter, brightly covered feather pillows. Kapus Irma was a\nnotable exception to the rule, and Elsa had often shed bitter tears of\nshame when one or other of her many admirers followed her into her home\nand saw the squalor which reigned in it--the dirt and untidiness. She\nwas most ashamed when B\u00c3\u00a9la was here, for he made sneering remarks about\nit all, and seemed to take it for granted that she was as untidy, as\nslovenly as her mother. He read her long lectures about his sister's\nfine qualities and about the manner in which he would expect his own\nwife to keep her future home, and made it an excuse for some of his\nmost dictatorial pronouncements and rough, masterful ways.\n\nBut to-night even this had not mattered--though he had spoken very\ncruelly about the hemp--nothing now mattered any more. To-day she had\nbeen called for the third time in church, to-morrow evening she would\nsay good-bye to her maidenhood and take her place for the last time\namong her girl-friends: after to-morrow's feast she would be a\nmatron--her place would be a different one. And on Tuesday would come\nthe wedding and she would be Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la's wedded wife.\n\nSo what did anything matter any more? After Tuesday she would not even\nbe allowed to think of Andor, to dream that he had come back and that\nthe past two dreadful years had only been an ugly nightmare. Once she\nwas Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la's wedded wife, it would be no longer right to think of\nthat last morning five years ago, of that final cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s, and the words\nwhich Andor had whispered: above all, it would no longer be right to\nremember that kiss--his warm lips upon her bare shoulder, and later on,\nout under the acacia tree, that last kiss upon her lips.\n\nShe closed her eyes for a moment; a sigh of infinite regret escaped\nthrough her parted lips. It would have been so beautiful, if only it\ncould have come true! if only something had been left to her of those\nenchanted hours, something more tangible than just a memory.\n\nResolutely now she went back to her work; for the past two years she had\nfound that she could imagine herself to be quite moderately happy, if\nonly she had plenty to do; and she did hope that B\u00c3\u00a9la would allow her to\nwork in her new home and not to lead a life of idleness--waited on by\npaid servants.\n\nShe had thrown the door wide open, and every now and then, when she\npaused in her work, she could go and stand for a moment under its narrow\nlintel; and from this position, looking out toward the west, she could\nsee the sunset far away beyond where the plain ended, where began\nanother world. The plumed heads of the maize were tipped with gold, and\nin the sky myriads and myriads of tiny clouds lay like a gigantic and\nfleecy comet stretching right over the dome of heaven above the plain to\nthat distant horizon far, far away.\n\nElsa loved to watch those myriads of clouds through the many changes\nwhich came over them while the sun sank so slowly, so majestically down\ninto the regions which lay beyond the plain. At first they had been\ndowny and white, like the freshly-plucked feathers of a goose, then some\nof them became of a soft amber colour, like ripe maize, then those far\naway appeared rose-tinted, then crimson, then glowing like fire .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nand that glow spread and spread up from the distant horizon, up and up\ntill each tiny cloud was suffused with it, and the whole dome of heaven\nbecame one fiery, crimson, fleecy canopy, with peeps between of a pale\nturquoise green.\n\nIt was beautiful! Elsa, leaning against the frame-work of the door,\ngazed into that gorgeous immensity till her eyes ached with the very\nmagnificence of the sight. It lasted but a few minutes--a quarter of an\nhour, perhaps--till gradually the blood-red tints disappeared behind the\ntall maize; they faded first, then the crimson and the rose and the\ngold, till, one by one, the army of little clouds lost their glowing\nrobes and put on a grey hue, dull and colourless like people's lives\nwhen the sunshine of love has gone down--out of them.\n\nWith a little sigh Elsa turned back into the small living-room, which\nlooked densely black and full of gloom now by contrast with the\nsplendour which she had just witnessed. From the village street close by\ncame the sound of her mother's sharp voice in excited conversation with\na neighbour.\n\n\"It will be all right, Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni,\" the neighbour said, in response to\nsome remark of the other woman. \"Klara Goldstein does not expect our\nvillage girls to take much notice of her. But I will say that the men\nare sharp enough dangling round her skirts.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" retorted Irma, \"and I wish to goodness B\u00c3\u00a9la had not set his heart\non having her at the feast. He is so obstinate: once he has said a thing\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"B\u00c3\u00a9la's conduct in this matter is not to be commended, my good Irma,\"\nsaid the neighbour sententiously; \"everyone thinks that for a tokened\nman it is a scandal to be always hanging round that pert Jewess. Why\ndidn't he propose to her instead of to Elsa, if he liked her so much\nbetter?\"\n\n\"Hush! hush! my good Mariska, please. Elsa might hear you.\"\n\nThe two women went on talking in whispers. Elsa had heard, of course,\nwhat they said: and since she was alone a hot blush of shame mounted to\nher cheeks. It was horrid of people to talk in that way about her future\nhusband, and she marvelled how her own mother could lend herself to such\ngossip.\n\nIrma came in a few minutes later. She looked suspiciously at her\ndaughter.\n\n\"Why do you keep the door open?\" she asked sharply, \"were you expecting\nanybody to come in?\"\n\n\"Only you, mother, and Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius is coming after vespers,\"\nreplied the girl.\n\n\"I stopped outside for a bit of gossip with Mariska just now. Could you\nhear what she said?\"\n\n\"Yes, mother. I did hear something of what Mariska said.\"\n\n\"About B\u00c3\u00a9la?\"\n\n\"About him--yes.\"\n\n\"Hej, child! you must not take any notice of what folks say--it is only\ntittle-tattle. You must not mind it.\"\n\n\"I don't mind it, mother. I am sure that it is only tittle-tattle.\"\n\n\"Your father in bed?\" asked Irma abruptly changing the subject of\nconversation.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you have been busying yourself, I see,\" continued the mother,\nlooking round her with obvious disapproval, \"with matters that do not\nconcern you. I suppose B\u00c3\u00a9la has been persuading you that your mother is\nincapable of keeping her own house tidy, so you must needs teach her how\nto do it.\"\n\n\"No, mother, nothing was further from my thoughts. I had nothing to do\nafter I had cleared and washed up, and I wanted something to do.\"\n\n\"If you wanted something to do you might have got out your father's\nbunda\" (big sheepskin cloak worn by the peasantry) \"and seen if the moth\nhas got into it or not. It is two years since he has had it on, and he\nwill want it to-morrow.\"\n\n\"To-morrow?\"\n\n\"Why, yes. I really must tell you because of the bunda, Jank\u00c3\u00b3 and M\u00c3\u00b3ritz\nand Jen\u00c3\u00b6 and P\u00c3\u00a1l have offered to carry him to the feast in his chair\njust as he is. We'll put his bunda round him, and they will strap some\npoles to his chair, so that they can carry him more easily. They\noffered to do it. It was to be a surprise for you for your farewell\nto-morrow: but I had to tell you, because of getting the bunda out and\nseeing whether it is too moth-eaten to wear.\"\n\nWhile Irma went on talking in her querulous, acid way, Elsa's eyes had\nquickly filled with tears. How good people were! how thoughtful! Was it\nnot kind of M\u00c3\u00b3ritz and Jen\u00c3\u00b6 and the others to have thought of giving her\nthis great pleasure?\n\nTo have her poor old father near her, after all, when she was saying\nfarewell to all her maidenhood's friends! And what a joy it would be to\nhim!--one that would brighten him through many days to come.\n\nOh! people were good! It was monstrously ungrateful to be unhappy when\none lived among these kind folk.\n\n\"Where is the bunda, mother?\" she asked eagerly. \"I'll see to it at\nonce. And if the moths are in it, why I must just patch the places up so\nthat they don't show. Where is the bunda, mother?\"\n\nIrma thought a moment, then she frowned, and finally shrugged her\nshoulders.\n\n\"How do I know?\" she said petulantly; \"isn't it in your room?\"\n\n\"No, mother. I haven't seen it since father wore it last.\"\n\n\"And that was two years ago--almost to a day. I remember it quite well.\nIt was quite chilly, and your father put on his bunda to go down the\nstreet as far as the Jew's house. It was after sunset, I remember. He\ncame home and went to bed. The next morning he was stricken. And I put\nthe bunda away somewhere. Now wherever did I put it?\"\n\nShe stood pondering for a moment.\n\n\"Under his paillasse?\" she murmured to herself. \"No. In the cupboard?\nNo.\"\n\n\"In the dower-chest, mother?\" suggested Elsa, who knew of old that that\narticle of furniture was the receptacle for everything that hadn't a\nproper place.\n\n\"Yes. Look at the bottom,\" said Irma placidly, \"it might be there.\"\n\nIt was getting dark now. Through the open door and the tiny hermetically\nclosed windows the grey twilight peeped in shyly. The more distant\ncorner of the little living-room, that which embraced the hearth and the\ndower-chest, was already wrapped in gloom.\n\nElsa bent over the worm-eaten piece of furniture: her hands plunged in\nthe midst of maize-husks and dirty linen, of cabbage-stalks and\nsunflower-seeds, till presently they encountered something soft and\nwoolly.\n\n\"Here is the bunda, mother,\" she said.\n\n\"Ah, well! get it out now, and lay it over a chair. You can have a look\nat it to-morrow--there will be plenty of time before you need begin to\ndress,\" said Irma, who held the theory that it was never any use doing\nto-day what could conveniently be put off until to-morrow.\n\n\"Mayn't I have a look at it now, mother?\" asked Elsa, as she struggled\nwith the heavy sheepskin mantle and drew it out of the surrounding\nrubbish; \"the light will hold out for another half-hour at least, and\nto-morrow morning I shall have such a lot to do.\"\n\n\"You may do what you like while the light lasts, my girl, but I won't\nhave you waste the candle over this stupid business. Candle is very\ndear, and your father will never wear his bunda again after to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I won't waste the candle, mother. But Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius is coming in to\nsee me after vespers.\"\n\n\"What does he want to come at an hour when all sensible folk are in\nbed?\" queried Irma petulantly.\n\n\"He couldn't come earlier, mother dear; you know how busy he is always\non Sundays .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. benediction, then christenings, then vespers. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. He\nsaid he would be here about eight o'clock.\"\n\n\"Eight o'clock!\" exclaimed the woman, \"who ever heard of such a\nridiculous hour? And candles are so dear--there's only a few centim\u00c3\u00a8tres\nof it in the house.\"\n\n\"I'll only light the candle, mother, when the Pater comes,\" said Elsa,\nwith imperturbable cheerfulness; \"I'll just sit by the open door now and\nput a stitch or two in father's bunda while the light lasts: and when I\ncan't see any longer I'll just sit quietly in the dark, till the Pater\ncomes. I shall be quite happy,\" she added, with a quaint little sigh, \"I\nhave such a lot to think about.\"\n\n\"So have I,\" retorted Irma, \"and I shall go and do my thinking in bed. I\nshall have to be up by six o'clock in the morning, I expect, and anyhow\nI hate sitting up in the dark.\"\n\nShe turned to go into the inner room, but Elsa--moved by a sudden\nimpulse--ran after her and put her arms round her mother's neck.\n\n\"Won't you kiss me, mother?\" she said wistfully. \"You won't do it many\nmore times in my old home.\"\n\n\"A home you have often been ashamed of, my child,\" the mother said\nsullenly.\n\nBut she kissed the girl--if not with tenderness, at any rate with a\ncurious feeling of pity which she herself could not have defined.\n\n\"Good-night, my girl,\" she said, with more gentleness than was her wont.\n\"Sleep well for the last time in your old bed. I doubt if to-morrow\nyou'll get into it at all, and don't let the Pater stay too long and\nwaste the candle.\"\n\n\"I promise, mother,\" said Elsa, with a smile; \"good-night!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\"Then, as now, may God protect you.\"\n\n\nThe bunda was very heavy. Elsa dragged it over her knee, and sat down on\na low stool in the open doorway. She had pulled the table a little\ncloser, and on it were her scissors, needles and cotton, as well as the\nbox of matches and the candle which she would be allowed to light\npresently when Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius came.\n\nThe moth certainly had caused many ravages in the sheepskin cloak--there\nwere tiny holes everywhere, and the fur when you touched it came out in\nhandfuls. But as the fur would be turned inwards, that wouldn't matter\nso much. The bunda was quite wearable: there was just a bad tear in the\nleather close to the pocket, which might show and which must be mended.\n\nElsa threaded her needle, and began to hum her favourite song under her\nbreath:\n\n    \"Nincsen annyi tenger csillag az \u00c3\u00a9gen\n    Mint a h\u00c3\u00a1nyszor vagy eszembe te n\u00c3\u00a9kem.\"\n\n    \"There are not so many myriads of stars in the sky as\n    the number of times that my thoughts fly to thee!\"\n\nShe was determined not to think any more of the past. In a few hours now\nthat chapter in her life would be closed, and it was useless and wicked\nto be always thinking of the \"might-have-been.\" Rather did she set\nherself resolutely to think of the future, of that part of it, at any\nrate, which was bright. There would be her mother installed in that\ncomfortable house on the Kender Road, and with a nice bit of land and\ngarden round in which to grow vegetables and keep some poultry. There\nwould be her three cows and the pigs which B\u00c3\u00a9la was giving her, and\nwhich he would graze on his own land.\n\nAbove all, there would be the comfortable bed and armchair for the sick\nman, and the little maid to wait upon him.\n\nThere was so much, so much to be thankful for! And since God chose to\ntake Andor away, what else was there to live for, save to see her mother\nand father contented?\n\nThe light was going fast. Elsa had made a splendid job of that one\npocket. The other, too, wanted a stitch. It was very badly torn--if only\nthe feeble light would hold out another ten minutes .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. that hole,\ntoo, would be securely mended.\n\nWith the splendid disregard of youth for its most precious gift, Elsa\nstrained her eyes to thread her needle once more.\n\nShe tackled the second pocket of the shabby bunda. There was a long tear\nat the side, as if the wearer's hand had missed the actual pocket and\nbeen thrust carelessly or roughly through the leather.\n\nElsa put her hand through the hole, too, to see the extent of the\nmischief. Yes! that was it, her father must more than once have missed\nthe pocket and put his hand into the hole, making it bigger and bigger.\nWhy! there was a whole lot of rubbish deep down inside the lining. Elsa\ndrew out an empty tobacco-pouch, a bit of string, a length of tinder,\nand from the very bottom, where it lay in a crinkled mass, a ball of\ncrumpled paper.\n\nThis she smoothed out, holding it over her knee. It was a letter--one\nwhich must have been delivered on the very day when her father last wore\nthe bunda. The envelope had not been broken: old Kapus hadn't had time\nto read his letter, the last which he had received before living death\nencompassed him. The tears gathered in Elsa's eyes at thought of her\nfather handling this very letter with shaking yet still living hands:\nnow they were incapable even of gripping this tiny piece of paper.\n\nBut then--two years ago, her mother said it was, almost to a day when\nlast he wore the bunda--then he had received the letter from the postman\nand evidently thrust it into his pocket, meaning to read it at some more\nconvenient time.\n\nThe peasants of that part of the world have never quite lost their\ndistrust of railways, of telegrams, and even of letters--they are\nhalf-afraid of them all, afraid with that vague, unreasoning fear which\nanimals have for things they see yet cannot understand.\n\nElsa handled this unopened letter with something of that same fear. She\ndid not think at first of looking at the superscription. Who could have\nbeen writing to her father two years ago? He had no rich friends who\ncould afford to spend money on note-paper and stamps. There was no news\nin the great outer world which someone could have wished to impart to\nhim. The light indeed was very dim before Elsa, sitting here with the\nold bunda on her knee, thought of looking more closely at the envelope.\n\nShe bent down and out toward the light, trying to decipher the writing.\n\nThe letter was addressed to her.\n\nOh! it was quite clear!\n\n\"Tekintetes Kapus Elsa kisasszonynak.\"\n\nIt was quite, quite clearly written. The letter was addressed to her.\nThe postman had brought it here two years ago: her father had taken it\nfrom him and thrust it into the pocket of his bunda, meaning to give it\npresently to his daughter.\n\nBut that evening perhaps he forgot it altogether: he had been drinking\nrather heavily of late. And the next day he was stricken down with\nparalysis, his tongue refused him service, and he no longer could tell\nhis daughter--as no doubt he wanted to do--that a letter had come for\nher and that it was in the pocket of his bunda.\n\nAnd the bunda was thrust away into the dower-chest with the husks of\nmaize and the cabbage-stalks, and it had never been taken out until\nto-night--the eve of Elsa's wedding-day.\n\nShe tore open the envelope now with fingers that trembled slightly. The\nlight was very dim, and where the glorious sunset had been such a little\nwhile ago there was only the dull grey canopy of an overcast sky. But\nElsa could just make out the writing: already her eye had wandered to\nthe signature, \"your ever-devoted Andor.\" The message seemed to come to\nher as from the grave, for she thought that these were probably Andor's\nlast words to her, penned just before he died in that awful hospital in\nBosnia.\n\n     \"My sweet dove!\" she read. \"This is to tell you that I\n     am well: although it has been a close fight between\n     life and death for me. But I did so want to live, my\n     sweetheart, for I have you to look forward to in life.\n     I have been at death's door, and I believe that the\n     doctor here, before he went away one evening, signed\n     the paper to say that I was dead. But that same night I\n     took a turn for the better, and it was wonderful how\n     soon I was up again. I'll tell you all about it some\n     day, my love, some day when I come to claim your\n     promise that you would wait for me. Because, dear\n     heart, while I have been ill I have been thinking very\n     seriously. I have not a silver florin to bless myself\n     with: how can I come and dare to ask you to be my wife?\n     Your father and mother would kick me out of their\n     house, they would forbid me to see you; they would part\n     you from me, my dear, beautiful angel, and I should\n     feel that it was just. I--a good-for-nothing, penniless\n     lout, daring to approach the queen of beauty, the most\n     exquisite girl on God's earth. I have thought it all\n     over, dear heart, and all will be well if you will be\n     true to me--if you will wait for me another two years.\n     Oh! I do not ask you to do it, I am not worthy of your\n     love. Who am I, that you should keep yourself for\n     me?--but I will pray to God night and day that He may\n     not take away your love from me. I am going to America,\n     dear heart, with an English gentleman who has been very\n     kind to me. He was the English Consul at Cettinje, and\n     when there were so many of us--Hungarian lads--lying\n     sick of that awful cholera in the hospital at\n     Slovnitza, his wife, a sweet, kind lady, used to come\n     and visit us and cheer us up. She was very ugly and had\n     big teeth and no waist, but she was an angel of\n     goodness. She took some interest in me, and once when I\n     was still very weak and ill I told her about you, about\n     our love and what little hope I had of ever winning\n     you, seeing that I was penniless. She was greatly\n     interested, and when I was finally allowed to leave the\n     hospital, she told me to come and see her husband, the\n     English Consul. Well! dear heart, this kind gentleman\n     is sending me out to a farm which he possesses in a\n     place called Australia--I think that it is somewhere in\n     America, but I am not sure. When I get there I shall\n     receive more wage in one week than our alf\u00c3\u00b6ld labourers\n     get in three months, and it will all be good money, of\n     which I can save every fill\u00c3\u00a9r, because my food and\n     housing will be given to me free, and the kind English\n     lady--may the Virgin protect her, despite her large\n     teeth and flat chest--gave me a whole lot of clothes to\n     take with me. So every fill\u00c3\u00a9r which I earn I can save,\n     and I reckon that in two years I shall have saved two\n     thousand florins\" (about \u00c2\u00a3160) \"and then I shall come\n     home. If I still find you free, my dove--which I pray\n     to God I may do--we can get married at once. Then we'll\n     rent the Lepke farm from Pali b\u00c3\u00a1csi, as I shall have\n     plenty of money for the necessary security, and if we\n     cannot make that pay and become rich folk within three\n     years, then I am not the man whom I believe myself to\n     be.\n\n     \"But, my darling love, do not think for a moment that I\n     want to bind you to me against your will. God only\n     knows how deeply I love you; during the last three\n     years the thought of you has been the sunshine of my\n     days, the light of my nights. If, when you have\n     received and pondered over this letter, you send me a\n     reply to say that you still love me, that you will be\n     true to me and will wait for my return, then you will\n     change my world into a paradise. No work will be too\n     hard, no difficulty too great to surmount, if it will\n     help me the sooner to come back to you. But if, on the\n     other hand, you tell me or leave me to guess that I am\n     a fool for thinking that you would waste your beauty\n     and your sweetness on waiting for a good-for-nothing\n     scamp like me, why, then, I shall understand. I shall\n     go out to America--or wherever that place called\n     Australia may be--but maybe I shall never come back.\n     But I should never curse you, dear heart, I should\n     never cease to love you: I should quite understand.\n\n     \"I have got one of the nurses at the hospital to write\n     this letter for me, to put my rough words into good\n     Hungarian and to write down my thoughts in a good,\n     clear hand. That is how it comes to be so well written.\n     You know I was never much of a hand with a pen and\n     paper, but I do love you, my dove! My God, how I love\n     you.\n\n     \"The nurse says that Australia is not in America at\n     all--that it is a different place altogether. Well! I\n     do not care where it is. I am going there because there\n     I can earn one hundred florins a month, and save enough\n     in two years to marry you and keep you in comfort. But\n     I shall not see you, my dove, before I go: if I saw you\n     again, if I saw Hungary again, our village, our alf\u00c3\u00b6ld,\n     Heaven help me! but I don't think I would have the\n     heart to go away again.\n\n     \"Farewell, dear heart, I go away full of hope. We go\n     off next week in a big, big ship from here. I go full\n     of sadness, but if you do want me to come back just\n     write me a little letter with the one word 'Yes,' and\n     address it as above. Then will my sadness be changed to\n     heavenly joy and hope. But if it is to be 'No,' then\n     tell me so quite truly, and I will understand.\n\n     \"Then, as now, may God protect you, my dove, my heart,\n\n     \"Your ever-devoted\n\n     \"ANDOR.\"\n\nThe letter fell out of Elsa's hands on to her knee. She took no heed of\nit, she was staring out into the immensity far away, into the\nfast-gathering gloom. Two years ago! Two years of sorrow and vain\nregrets which never need have been. One word from her father or from the\npostman, the feel of crisp paper in her father's bunda when it was put\naway two years ago, and the whole course of her life would have been\nchanged.\n\nThe village street behind her was silent now, even the footsteps of\nbelated folk hurrying to their homes sent up no echo from the soft,\nsandy ground. And before her the fast-gathering night was slowly\nwrapping the plain in its peace-giving shroud. Inside the cottage all\nwas still: mother and father lay either asleep or awake thinking of the\nmorrow.\n\nA great, heavy sob shook the young girl's vigorous young frame. It\nseemed too wantonly cruel, this decree of Fate which had withheld from\nher the light of her life. How easy it would have been to wait! How\nswiftly these two years would have flown past. Her heart would have kept\nyoung--waiting for Andor and for happiness, whereas now it was numb and\nunsentient, save for a feeling of obedience and of filial duty, of pity\nfor her mother and father, and of resignation to her future state.\n\nIndeed Fate was being wantonly cruel to her to the last in thus putting\nbefore her eyes a picture of the might-have-been just when it was too\nlate. In a few hours from now the great vow would be spoken, the\nirrevocable knot tied which bound her to another man. Her troth was\nalready plighted, her confession made to Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius--in a few\nhours from now she would be B\u00c3\u00a9la's wife, and if Andor did come back now,\nshe must be as nothing to him, he as a mere distant friend.\n\nBut probably he never would come back. He received no reply to his fond\nletter of farewell, not one word from her to cheer him on his way. No\ndoubt by now he had made a home for himself in that far distant land.\nAnother woman--a stranger--revelled in the sunshine of his love, while\nElsa, whose whole life had been wrapped up in him, was left desolate.\n\nFor a moment a wild spirit of revolt rose in her. Was it too late, after\nall? Was any moment in life too late to snatch at fleeing happiness? Why\nshouldn't she run away to-night--now?--find that unknown country, that\nunknown spot where Andor was? Surely God would give her strength! God\ncould not be so unjust and so cruel as men and Fate had been!\n\nPater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius, turning from the street round the angle of the\ncottage, found her in this mood, squatting on the low stool, her elbows\non her knees, her face buried in her hands. He came up to her quite\ngently, for though his was a simple soul it was full of tenderness and\nof compassion for the children of these plains whom God had committed\ninto his charge.\n\n\"Elsa, my girl,\" he asked softly, \"what is it?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\"The best way of all.\"\n\n\nPater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius had placed his kindly hand on the girl's hunched-up\nshoulders, and there was something in his touch which seemed to soothe\nthe wild paroxysm of her grief. She raised her tear-stained face to his,\nand without a word--for her lips were shaking and she could not have\nspoken then--she handed him Andor's letter.\n\n\"May I go in,\" he asked, \"and light the candle? It is too dark now to\nread.\"\n\nShe rose quickly, and with an instinctive sense of respect for the\nparish priest she made hasty efforts to smooth her hair and to wipe her\nface with her apron. Then she turned into the room, and though her hand\nstill trembled slightly, she contrived to light the candle.\n\nThe old priest adjusted his horn-rimmed spectacles on his nose and drew\na chair close to the light.\n\nHe sat down and read Andor's letter through very slowly. When he had\nfinished, he handed it back to Elsa.\n\n\"God's ways, my child, are mysterious,\" he said, with a short sigh; \"it\nis not for us to question them.\"\n\n\"Mysterious?\" exclaimed the girl, with passionate wrath; \"I call them\ncruel and unjust, pater! What have I done, that He should have done this\nto me? Andor loved me and I loved him, he wrote me a letter full of\nlove, begging for a word from me to assure him that I would always love\nhim and that I would wait for him. Why was that letter kept from me? Why\nwas I not allowed to reply to it? My father would not have kept the\nletter from me, had he not been stricken down with paralysis on the very\nday when it came. It is God who kept my happiness away from me. It is\nGod who has spoilt my life and condemned me to regrets and wretchedness,\nwhen I had done nothing to deserve such a cruel fate!\"\n\n\"It is God,\" interposed the priest gently, \"who even at this moment\nforgives an erring child all the blasphemy which she utters.\"\n\nThen, as Elsa, dry-eyed and with quivering lips, still looked the\npersonification of revolt, he placed his warm, gentle hands upon hers\nand drew her a little closer to him.\n\n\"Are we, then,\" he asked softly, \"such very important things in the\nscheme of God's entire creation that everything must be ordered so as to\nsuit us best?\"\n\n\"I only wanted to be happy,\" murmured Elsa, in a quivering voice.\n\n\"You only wanted to be happy in your own way, my child,\" rejoined the\npriest, as he patted her hands tenderly, \"but it does not happen to have\nbeen God's way. Now who shall say which is the best way of being happy?\nWho knows best? You or God?\"\n\n\"If the postman had given me the letter, and not to father,\" she\nmurmured dully, \"if father had not been stricken down with illness the\nvery next day, if I had only had this letter two years ago, instead of\nto-day .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nAnd the sentence was left unfinished, broken by a bitter sigh of regret.\n\n\"If it all had been as you say, my child,\" said Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius kindly,\n\"then you might perhaps have been happy according to your own light,\nwhereas now you are going to be happy in accordance with that of God.\"\n\nShe shook her head and once more her eyes filled with tears.\n\n\"I shall never be happy again,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Oh, yes, you will, my dear,\" retorted the kindly old man, whose rugged\nface--careworn and wrinkled--was lit up with a half-humorous, wholly\nindulgent smile; \"it is wonderful what a capacity for happiness the good\nGod has given to us all. The only thing is that we can't always be happy\nin our own way; but the other ways--if they are God's ways--are very\nmuch better, believe me. Why He chose to part you from Andor,\" he added,\nwith touching simplicity, \"why He chose to withhold that letter from you\nuntil to-night, we shall probably never know. But that it was His way\nfor your future happiness, of that I am convinced.\"\n\n\"There could have been no harm this time, Pater, in Andor and I being\nhappy in our way. There could be no wrong in two people caring for one\nanother, and wanting to live their lives together.\"\n\n\"Ah! that we shall never know, my child. The book of the\n'might-have-been' is a closed one for us. Only God has the power to turn\nover its pages.\"\n\n\"Andor and I would have been so happy!\" she reiterated, with the\nobstinacy of a vain regret; \"and life would have been an earthly\nparadise.\"\n\n\"And perhaps you would have forgotten heaven in that earthly paradise;\nwho knows, your happiness might have drawn you away from God, you might\nhave spent your life in earthly joys, you might have danced and sung and\nthought more and more of pleasure, and less and less of God. Who knows?\nWhereas now you are just going to be happy in God's way: you are going\nto do your duty by your mother and your father, and, above all, by your\nhusband. You are going to fill your life by thoughts of God first and\nthen of others, instead of filling it with purely selfish joys. You are\ngoing to walk up the road of life, my child, with duty to guide you over\nthe roughnesses and hard stones that will bestrew your path: and every\nroughness which is surmounted, every hardship which is endured, every\nsacrifice of self which is offered up to One who made the greatest\npossible sacrifice for us all, will leave you happier than before .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nhappier in God's way, the best way of all.\"\n\nHe talked on for a long while in this gentle, heartfelt way, and\ngradually, as the old man spoke, the bitterness and revolt died out of\nthe simple-minded child's heart. Hers, after all, was a simple\nfaith--but as firmly rooted within her as her belief in the sunshine,\nthe alternating days and nights, the turns of the season. And the kind\npriest, who after life's vicissitudes had found anchorage in this\nforlorn village in the midst of the plains, knew exactly how to deal\nwith these childlike souls. Like those who live their lives upon the\nsea, the Hungarian peasant sees only immensity around him, and above him\nthat wonderful dome which hides its ineffable mysteries behind glorious\nveils of sunset and sunrise, of storm and of fantastic clouds. The plain\nstretches its apparently limitless expanse to a distance which he--its\nchild--has never reached. Untutored and unlearned, he does not know what\nlies beyond that low-lying horizon into whose arms the sun sinks at\nevening in a pool of fire.\n\nEverything around him is so great, so vast, so wonderful--the rising and\nsetting of the sun, the stars and moon at nights, the gathering storms,\nthe rainfalls, the sowing of the maize and the corn, the travail of the\nearth and the growing and developing of the stately heads of maize from\none tiny, dried, yellow grain--that he has no inclination for petty\ncasuistry, for arguments or philosophy. God's work is all that he ever\nsees: the book of life and death the only one he reads.\n\nAnd because of that simple faith, that sublime ignorance, Elsa found\ncomfort and peace in what Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius said. I will not say that she\nceased to regret, nor that the grief of her heart was laid low, but her\nheart was soothed, and to her already heavy sorrow there was no longer\nlaid the additional burden of a bitter resentment.\n\nThen for awhile after he had spoken the priest was silent. No one knew\nbetter than he did the exact value of silence, whilst words had time to\nsink in. So they both remained in the gloom side by side--he the\nconsoler and she the healed. The flickering candle light played curious\nand fantastic tricks with their forms and faces, lighting up now and\nthen the wrinkled, wizened face of the old man, with the horn-rimmed\nspectacles perched upon his nose, and now and then the delicate profile\nof the girl, the smooth, fair tresses and round, white neck.\n\n\"Shall we not say a little prayer together?\" whispered Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius\nat last, \"just the prayer which our dear Lord taught us--Our Father\nwhich art in heaven .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nSlowly the young girl sank on her knees beside the gentle comforter; her\nfair head was bowed, her face hidden in her hands. Word for word now she\nrepeated after him the sublime invocation taught by Divine lips.\n\nAnd when the final whispered Amen ceased to echo in the low, raftered\nroom, Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius laid his hand upon the child's head in a gesture\nof unspoken benediction.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\"After that, happiness will begin.\"\n\n\nPater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius' kindliness, his gentle philosophy and unquestioning\nfaith exercised a soothing influence over Elsa's spirits. The one moment\nof rebellion against Fate and against God, before the arrival of the old\npriest, had been the first and the last.\n\nThere is a goodly vein of Oriental fatalism still lurking in the\nHungarians: \"God has willed it!\" comes readily enough to their lips.\nThough this unsophisticated child of the plains suffered none the less\nthan would her more highly-cultured sisters in the West, yet she was\nmore resigned--in her humble way, more philosophical--accepting the\ninevitable with an aching heart, mayhap, but with a firm determination\nto make the best of the few shreds of happiness which were left to her.\n\nElsa had promised before God and before the whole village that she would\nmarry Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la on the feast of St. Michael and All Angels, and after\nthat single thought of rebellion, she knew that on the following Tuesday\nthis would have to be just as surely as the day follows the night and\nthe night the day.\n\nEven that selfsame evening, after the Pater had gone and before she went\nto bed, she made her final preparations for the next three days, which\nwere the turning-points of her life. To-morrow her farewell banquet: a\nhuge feast in the big schoolroom, hired expressly for the occasion.\nFifty people would sit down to that, they were the most intimate\nfriends of the contracting parties, hers and B\u00c3\u00a9la's, and her mother's.\nIt is the rule that the bride's parents provide this entertainment, but\nKapus Benk\u00c3\u00b3 and his wife had not the means for it, and Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la,\ninsisting upon a sumptuous feast, was ready enough to pay for this\ngratification of his own vanity.\n\nAfter the banquet, dancing would begin and would be kept up half the\nnight. Then the next morning was the wedding-day. The wedding Mass in\nthe morning, then the breakfast, more dancing, more revelling, more\njollification, also kept up throughout the night. For it is only on the\nday following, that the bridegroom goes to fetch his bride out of her\nhome, to conduct her to his own with all the pomp and circumstance which\nhis wealth allows. So many carts, so many oxen, so many friends in the\ncarts, and so many gipsies to make music while the procession slowly\npasses up the village street.\n\nAll that was, of course, already arranged for. The banquet for to-morrow\nwas prepared, the ox roasted whole, the pigs and the capons stuffed.\nEr\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la had provided everything, and provided most lavishly. Fifty\npersons would sit down to the farewell banquet, and more like two\nhundred to the wedding-breakfast; the village was agog with excitement,\ngipsies from Arad had been engaged, my lord the Count and the Countess\nwere coming to the wedding Mass! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. how could one feeble, weak,\nignorant girl set her will against this torrent?\n\nElsa, conscious of her helplessness, set to with aching heart, but\nunwavering determination to put the past entirely behind her.\n\nWhat was the good of thinking, since Fate had already arranged\neverything?\n\nShe went to bed directly after the Pater went away, because there was\nno more candle in the house, and because her mother kept calling\nquerulously to her; and having stretched her young limbs out upon the\nhard paillasse, she slept quite peacefully, because she was young and\nhealthy and did not suffer from nerves, and because sorrow had made her\nvery weary.\n\nAnd the next morning, the dawn of the first of those all-important three\ndays, found her busy, alert, quite calm outwardly, even though her\ncheeks had lost something of their rosy hue, and her blue eyes had a\nglitter in them which suggested unshed tears.\n\nThere was a lot to do, of course: the invalid to get ready, the mother's\ndressing to see to, so that she should not look slovenly in her\nappearance, and call forth some of those stinging remarks from B\u00c3\u00a9la\nwhich had the power to wound the susceptibilities of his fianc\u00c3\u00a9e.\n\nIrma was captious and in a tearful humour, bemoaning the fact that she\nwas too poor to pay for her only daughter's farewell repast.\n\n\"Whoever heard of a bridegroom paying for his fianc\u00c3\u00a9e's farewell?\" she\nsaid. \"You will despise your poor parents now, Elsa.\"\n\nIt was certainly an unusual thing under the circumstances; the maiden's\nfarewell to the friends of her girlhood, to their parents and\nbelongings, is a great event in this part of the world in connection\nwith the wedding festivities themselves, of which it is the precursor.\nThe parents of the bride invariably provide the entertainment, and do so\nin accordance with their means.\n\nBut Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la was a proud man in the county: he would not hear of any\nfestival attendant upon his marriage being less than gorgeous and\ndazzling before the eyes of the whole countryside. He chose to pay the\npiper, so that he might call the tune, and though Elsa--wounded in her\nown pride--did her best to protest, she was overruled by her mother, who\nwas only too thankful to see this expensive burden taken from off her\nshoulders.\n\nKapus Irma was a proud mother to-day, for as Elsa finally stood before\nher, arrayed in all her finery for the coming feast, she fully justified\nher right to be styled \"the beauty of the county.\"\n\nA picture she looked from the top of her small head, with its smooth\ncovering of fair hair, yellow as the ripening corn, to the tips of her\nsmall, arched feet, encased in the traditional boots of bright crimson\nleather.\n\nHer fair hair was plaited closely from the crown of her head and tied up\nwith strands of red, white and green ribbons, nor did the hard line of\nthe hair drawn tightly away from the face mar the charm of its round\ngirlishness. It gave it its own peculiar character--semi-oriental, with\njust a remaining _soup\u00c3\u00a7on_ of that mysterious ancestry whose traditions\nare lost in the far-off mountains of Thibet.\n\nThe tight-fitting black corslet spanned the girlish figure, and made it\nlook all the more slender as it seemed to rise out of the outstanding\nbillows of numberless starched petticoats. Necklace and earrings made of\nbeads of solid gold--a present from B\u00c3\u00a9la to his fianc\u00c3\u00a9e--gave a touch of\nbarbaric splendour to this dainty apparition, whilst her bare shoulders\nand breast, her sturdy young arms and shapely, if toil-worn, hands made\nher look as luscious a morsel of fresh girlhood as ever gladdened the\nheart of man.\n\nIrma surveyed her daughter from head to foot with growing satisfaction.\nThen, with a gesture of unwonted impulse, she took the young girl by the\nshoulders and, drawing her closely to her own bony chest, she imprinted\ntwo sounding kisses on the fresh, pale cheeks.\n\n\"There,\" she said lustily, \"your mother's kiss ought to put some colour\nin those cheeks. Heigho, child!\" she added with a sigh, as she wiped a\nsolitary tear with the back of her hand, \"I don't wonder you are pale\nand frightened. It is a serious step for a girl to take. I know how I\nfelt when your father came and took me out of my mother's house! But for\nyou it is so easy: you are leaving a poor, miserable home for the finest\nhouse this side of the Maros and a life of toil and trouble for one of\nease! To-day you are still a maid, to-morrow you will be a married\nwoman, and the day after that your husband will fetch you with six carts\nand forty-eight oxen and a gipsy band and all his friends to escort you\nto your new home, just as every married woman in the country is fetched\nfrom her parents' home the day after she has spoken her marriage vows.\nAfter that your happiness will begin: you will soon forget the wretched\nlife you have had to lead for years, helping me to put maize into a\nhelpless invalid's mouth.\"\n\n\"I shall never forget my home, dear mother,\" said Elsa earnestly, \"and\nevery fill\u00c3\u00a9r which I earned and which helped to make my poor father\ncomfortable was a source of happiness to me.\"\n\n\"Hm!\" grunted the mother dryly, \"you have not looked these past two\nyears as if those sources of happiness agreed with you.\"\n\n\"I shall look quite happy in the future, mother,\" retorted Elsa\ncheerily; \"especially when I have seen you and father installed in that\nnice house in the Kender Road, with your garden and your cows and your\npigs and a maid to wait on you.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Irma na\u00c3\u00afvely, \"B\u00c3\u00a9la promised me all that if I gave you to\nhim: and I think that he is honest and will keep to his promise.\"\n\nThen, as Elsa was silent, she continued fussily:\n\n\"There, now, I think I had better go over to the schoolroom and see that\neverything is going on all right. I don't altogether trust Ilona and her\nparsimonious ways. Such airs she gives herself, too! I must go and show\nher that, whatever B\u00c3\u00a9la may have told her, I am the hostess at the\nbanquet to-day, and mean to have things done as I like and not as she\nmay choose to direct. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Now mind you don't allow your father to\ndisarrange his clothes. M\u00c3\u00b3ritz and the others will be here by about\neleven, and then you can arrange the bunda round him after they have\nfixed the carrying-poles to his chair. We sit down to eat at twelve\no'clock, and I will come back to fetch you a quarter of an hour before\nthat, so that you may walk down the street and enter the banqueting\nplace in the company of your mother, as it is fitting that you should\ndo. And don't let anyone see you before then: for that is not proper.\nWhen you fix the bunda round your father's shoulders, make all the men\ngo out of the house before you enter the room. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, mother.\"\n\n\"You know how particular B\u00c3\u00a9la is that everything should be done in\norderly and customary style, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, mother,\" replied Elsa, without the slightest touch of irony; \"I\nknow how much he always talks about propriety.\"\n\n\"Though you are not his wife,\" continued Irma volubly, \"and won't be\nuntil to-morrow, you must begin to-day to obey him in all things. And\nyou must try and be civil to Klara Goldstein, and not make B\u00c3\u00a9la angry by\nputting on grand, stiff airs with the woman.\"\n\n\"I will do my best, mother dear,\" said Elsa, with a quick short sigh.\n\n\"Good-bye, then,\" concluded Irma, as she finally turned toward the door,\n\"don't crumple your petticoats when you sit down, and don't go too near\nthe hearth, there is some grease upon it from this morning's breakfast.\nDon't let anyone see you and wait quietly for my return.\"\n\nHaving delivered herself of these admonitions, which she felt were\nincumbent upon her in her interesting capacity as the mother of an\nimportant bride, Irma at last sailed out of the door. Elsa--obedient to\nher mother and to convention, did not remain standing beneath the lintel\nas she would have loved to do on this beautiful summer morning, but drew\nback into the stuffy room, lest prying eyes should catch sight of the\nheroine of the day before her state entry into the banqueting hall.\n\nWith a weary little sigh she set about thinking what she could do to\nkill the next two hours before M\u00c3\u00b3ritz and Jen\u00c3\u00b6 and those other kind lads\ncame to take her father away. With the door shut the room was very dark:\nonly a small modicum of light penetrated through the solitary, tiny\nwindow. Elsa drew a chair close beside it and brought out her mending\nbasket and work-box. But before settling down she went back into the\nsleeping-room to see that the invalid was not needing her.\n\nOf course he always needed her, and more especially to-day, one of the\nlast that she would spend under his roof. He was not tearful about her\ndeparture--his senses were too blunt now to feel the grief of\nseparation--he only felt pleasantly excited, because he had been told\nthat M\u00c3\u00b3ritz and Jen\u00c3\u00b6 and the others were coming over presently and that\nthey meant to carry him in his chair, just as he was, so that he could\nbe present at his daughter's \"maiden's farewell.\" This had greatly\nelated him: he was looking forward to the rich food and the luscious\nwine which his rich future son-in-law was providing for his guests.\n\nAnd now, when Elsa came to him, dressed in all her pretty finery, he\nloved to look on her, and his dulled eyes glowed with an enthusiasm\nwhich had lain atrophied in him these past two years.\n\nHe was like a child now with a pretty doll, and Elsa, delighted at the\npleasure which she was giving him, turned about and around, allowed him\nto examine her beautiful petticoats, to look at her new red boots and to\ntouch with his lifeless fingers the beads of solid gold which her fianc\u00c3\u00a9\nhad given her.\n\nSuddenly, while she was thus displaying her finery for the benefit of\nher paralytic father, she heard the loud bang of the cottage door.\nSomeone had entered, someone with a heavy footstep which resounded\nthrough the thin partition between the two rooms.\n\nShe thought it must be one of the young men, perhaps, with the poles for\nthe carrying-chair; and she wondered vaguely why he had come so early.\n\nShe explained to the invalid that an unexpected visitor had come, and\nthat she must go and see what he wanted; and then, half ashamed that\nsomeone should see her contrary to her mother's express orders and to\nall the proprieties, she went to the door and opened it.\n\nThe visitor had not closed the outer door when he had entered, and thus\na gleam of brilliant September daylight shot straight into the narrow\nroom; it revealed the tall figure of a man dressed in town clothes, who\nstood there for all the world as if he had a perfect right to do so, and\nwho looked straight on Elsa as she appeared before him in the narrow\nframe of the inner door.\n\nHis face was in full light. She recognized him in the instant.\n\nBut she could not utter his name, she could not speak; her heart began\nto beat so fast that she felt that she must choke.\n\nThe next moment his arms were round her, he kicked the outer door to\nwith his foot, and then he dragged her further into the room; he called\nher name, and all the while he was laughing--laughing with the glee of a\nman who feels himself to be supremely happy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\"It is too late.\"\n\n\nAnd now there he was, as of old, sitting, as was his wont, on the corner\nof the table, his two strong hands firmly grasping Elsa's wrists. She\nheld him a little at arm's length, frightened still at the suddenness of\nhis apparition here--on this day--the day of her farewell feast.\n\nWhen first he drew her to him, she had breathed his name--softly panting\nwith excitement, \"Andor!\"\n\nThe blood had rushed to her cheeks, and then flowed back to her heart,\nleaving her pale as a lily. She did not look at him any more after that\nfirst glance, but held her head bent, and her eyes fixed to the ground.\nSlowly the tears trickled down her cheeks one by one.\n\nBut he did not take his glowing, laughing eyes away from her, though he,\ntoo, was speechless after that first cry of joy:\n\n\"Elsa!\"\n\nHe held her wrists and in a happy, irresponsible way was swinging her\narms out and in, all the while that he was drinking in the joy of seeing\nher again.\n\nSurely she was even more beautiful than she had ever been before. He did\nnot notice that she was dressed as for a feast, he did not heed that she\nheld her head down and that heavy tears fell from her eyes. He had\ncaught the one swift look from her blue eyes when she first recognized\nhim: he had seen the blush upon her cheeks then; the look and the blush\nhad told him all that he wanted to know, for they had revealed her soul\nto him. Manlike, he looked no further. Happiness is such a natural thing\nfor wretched humanity to desire, that it is so much easier to believe in\nit than in misery when it comes.\n\nAt last he contrived to say a few words.\n\n\"Elsa! how are you, my dove?\" he said na\u00c3\u00afvely.\n\n\"I am quite well, thank you, Andor,\" she murmured through her tears.\n\nThen she tried to draw her wrists out of his tenacious clutch.\n\n\"May I not kiss you, Elsa?\" he asked, with a light, happy laugh--the\nlaugh of a man sure of himself, and sure of the love which will yield\nhim the kiss.\n\n\"If you like, Andor,\" she replied.\n\nShe could not have denied him the kiss, not just then, at any rate, not\neven though every time that his warm lips found her eyes, her cheeks,\nher neck, she felt such a pain in her heart that surely she thought that\nshe must die of it.\n\nAfter that he let her wrists go, and she went to sit on a low stool,\nsome little distance away from him. Her cheeks were glowing now, and it\nwas no use trying to disguise her tears. Andor saw them, of course, but\nhe did not seem upset by them: he knew that girls were so different to\nmen, so much more sensitive and tender: and so now he was only chiding\nhimself for his roughness.\n\n\"I ought to have prepared you for my coming, Elsa,\" he said. \"I am\nafraid it has upset you.\"\n\n\"No, no, Andor, it's nothing,\" she protested.\n\n\"I did want to surprise you,\" he continued na\u00c3\u00afvely. \"Not that I ever\nreally doubted you, Elsa, even though you never wrote to me. I thought\nletters do get astray sometimes, and I was not going to let any\naccursed post spoil my happiness.\"\n\n\"No, of course not, Andor.\"\n\n\"You did not write to me, did you, Elsa?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, Andor. I did not write.\"\n\n\"But you had my letter? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I mean the one which I wrote to you before\nI sailed for Australia.\"\n\n\"The postman,\" she murmured, \"gave it to father when it came. Then the\nnext day father was stricken with paralysis; he never gave it to me.\nOnly last night .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"My God,\" he broke in excitedly, \"and yet you remained true to me all\nthis while, even though you did not know if I was alive or dead! Holy\nMother of God, what have I done to deserve such happiness?\"\n\nThen as she did not speak--for indeed the words in her throat were\nchoked by her tears--he continued talking volubly, like a man who is\nintoxicated with the wine of joy:\n\n\"Oh! I never doubted you, Elsa! But I had planned my home-coming to be a\nsurprise to you. It was not a question of keeping faith, of course,\nbecause you were never tokened to me, therefore I just wanted to read in\nyour dear eyes exactly what would come into them in the first moment of\nsurprise .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. whether it would be joy or annoyance, love or\nindifference. And I was not deceived, Elsa, for when you first saw me\nsuch a look came into your eyes as I would not exchange for all the\nangels' glances in Paradise.\"\n\nElsa sighed heavily. She felt so oppressed that she thought her heart\nmust burst. Andor's happiness, his confidence made the hideous truth\nitself so much more terrible to reveal. And now he went on in the same\nmerry, voluble way.\n\n\"I went first to Goldstein's this morning. I thought Klara would tell me\nsome of the village gossip to while away the time before I dared present\nmyself here. I didn't want Pali b\u00c3\u00a1csi or anybody to see me before I had\ncome to you. I didn't want anybody to speak to me before I had kissed\nyou. The Jews I didn't mind, of course. So I got Klara to walk with me\nby a round-about way through the fields as far as this house; then I lay\nin wait for a while, until I saw Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni go out. I wanted you all to\nmyself at once .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. with no one by to intercept the look which you\nwould give me when first you recognized me.\"\n\n\"And .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. did Klara tell you anything?\" she murmured under her breath.\n\n\"She told me of uncle Pali's illness,\" he said, more quietly, \"and how\nhe seemed to have fretted about me lately .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and that everyone here\nthought that I was dead.\"\n\n\"Yes. What else?\"\n\n\"Nothing else much,\" he replied, \"for you may be sure I would not do\nmore than just mention your sweet name before that Jewess.\"\n\n\"And .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. when you mentioned my name .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. did she say anything?\"\n\n\"No. She laughed rather funnily, I thought. But of course I would not\ntake any notice. She had always been rather jealous of you. And now that\nI am a rich man .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Yes, Andor?\"\n\n\"When I say a rich man,\" he said, with a careless shrug of his broad\nshoulders, \"I only mean comparatively, of course. I have saved three\nthousand crowns\"--(about \u00c2\u00a3120)--\"not quite as much as I should have\nliked; but things are dear out there, and there was my passage home and\nclothes to pay for. Still! three thousand crowns are enough to pay down\nas a guarantee for a really good farm, and if Klara Goldstein spoke the\ntruth, and Pali b\u00c3\u00a1csi is really so well disposed toward me, why, I need\nnot be altogether ashamed to present myself before your parents. Need I,\nmy dove?\"\n\n\"Before my parents?\" she murmured.\n\n\"Why, yes,\" he said, as he rose from the table now and came up quite\nclose to her, looking down with earnest, love-filled eyes on the\nstooping figure of this young girl, who held all his earthly happiness\nin her keeping; \"you knew what I meant, Elsa, did you not, when I came\nback to you the moment that I could, after all these years? It was only\nmy own poverty which kept me from your side all this long while. But you\ndid not think that I had forgotten you, did you, Elsa?--you could not\nthink that. How could a man forget you who has once held you in his arms\nand kissed those sweet lips of yours? Why, there has not been a day or\nnight that I did not think of you. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Night and day while I worked in\nthat land which seemed so far away from home. Homesick I was--very\noften--and though we all earned good money out there, the work was hard\nand heavy; but I didn't mind that, for I was making money, and every\nflorin which I put by was like a step which brought me nearer to you.\"\n\n\"Andor!\"\n\nThe poor girl was almost moaning now, for every word which he spoke was\nlike a knife-thrust straight into her heart.\n\n\"Being so far away from home,\" he continued, speaking slowly and very\nearnestly now, in a voice that quivered and shook with the depth of the\nsentiment within him, \"being so far away from home would have been like\nhell to me at times. I don't know what there is, Elsa, about this land\nof Hungary! how it holds and enchains us! but at times I felt that I\nmust lie down and die if I did not see our maize-fields bordered with\nthe tall sunflowers, our distant, low-lying horizon on which the rising\nand the setting sun paints such glowing colours. This land of Australia\nwas beautiful too: there were fine fields of corn and vast lands\nstretching out as far as the eye could reach; but it was not Hungary.\nThere were no white oxen with long, slender horns toiling patiently up\nthe dusty high roads, the storks did not build their nests in the tall\nacacia trees, nor did the arms of distant wells stretch up toward the\nsky. It was not Hungary, Elsa! and it would have been hell but for\nthinking of you. The life of an exile takes all the life out of one. I\nhave heard of some of our Hungarian lads out in America who get so ill\nwith homesickness that they either die or become vicious. But then,\" he\nadded, with a quick, characteristic return to his habitual light-hearted\ngaiety, \"it isn't everyone who is far from home who has such a bright\nstar as I had to gaze at in my mind .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. when it came night time and\nthe lights were put out .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Andor!\" she pleaded.\n\nBut he would not let her speak just then. He had not yet told her all\nthat there was to say, and perhaps the innate good-heartedness in him\nsuggested that she was discomposed, that she would prefer to sit quietly\nand listen whilst she collected her thoughts and got over the surprise\nof his sudden arrival.\n\n\"Do you know, Elsa,\" he now said gaily, \"I chalked up the days--made\nmarks, I mean, in a book which I bought in Fiume the day before we\nsailed. Seven hundred and thirty days--for I never meant to stay away\nmore than two years; and every evening in my bunk on board ship and\nafterwards in the farm where I lodged, I scratched out one of the marks\nand seemed to feel myself getting a little bit nearer and then nearer to\nyou. By the Saints, my dove,\" he added, with a merry laugh, \"but you\nshould have seen me the time I got cheated out of one of those\nscratches. I had forgotten that accursed twenty-ninth of February last\nyear. I don't think that I have ever sworn so wickedly in my life\nbefore. I had to go to Melbourne pretty soon, I tell you, and make\nconfession of it to the kind Pater there. And then .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHe paused abruptly. The laughter died upon his lips and the look of\ngaiety out of his eyes, for Elsa sat more huddled up in herself than\nbefore. He could no longer see her face, for that was hidden in her\nhands, he only saw her bowed shoulders, and that they were shaking as if\nthe girl had yielded at last to a paroxysm of weeping.\n\n\"Elsa!\" he said quietly, as a puzzled frown appeared between his brows,\n\"Elsa! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you don't say anything .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHe passed his rough hand across his forehead, on which rose heavy beads\nof perspiration. For the first time in the midst of his joy and of his\nhappiness a hideous doubt had begun to assail him.\n\nA hideous, horrible, poison-giving doubt!\n\n\"Elsa!\" he pleaded, and his voice grew more intense, as if behind it\nthere was an undercurrent of broken sobs, \"Elsa, what is the matter? You\nare not going to turn your back on me, are you? Look at me, Elsa! look\nat me! You wouldn't do it, would you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you wouldn't do it? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. The\nLord forgive me, but I love you, Elsa .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I love you fit to kill.\"\n\nHe was babbling like a child, and now he fell on his knees beside that\nlow stool on which she sat hunched up, a miserable bundle of suffering\nwomanhood. He hid his face in her petticoats--those beautiful, starched\npetticoats that were not to be crumpled--and all at once his manliness\nbroke down in the face of this awful, awful doubt, and he sobbed as if\nhis heart would break.\n\n\"Andor! Andor!\" she cried, overwhelmed with pity for him, pity for\nherself, with the misery and the hopelessness of it all. \"Andor, I beg\nof you, pull yourself together. Someone might come .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. they must not\nsee you like this.\"\n\nShe put her hand upon his head and passed her cool, white fingers\nthrough his hair. The gentle, motherly gesture soothed him: her words\nbrought him back to his senses. Gradually his sobs were stilled; he made\na great effort to become quite calm, and with a handkerchief wiped the\ntears and perspiration from his face.\n\nThen he rose and went back to the table, and sat down on the corner of\nit as he always liked to do. The workings of his face showed the effort\nwhich he made to keep his excitement and those awful fears in check.\n\n\"You are quite right, Elsa,\" he said calmly. \"Someone might come, and it\nwould not be a very fine home-coming for Lakatos Andor, would it? to be\nfound crying like an infant into a woman's petticoats. Why, what would\nthey think? That we had quarrelled, perhaps, on this my first day at\nhome. God forgive me, I quite lost myself that time, didn't I? It was\nfoolish,\" he added, with heartbroken anxiety, \"wasn't it, Elsa?\"\n\n\"Yes, Andor,\" she said simply.\n\n\"It was foolish,\" he reiterated, still speaking calmly, even though his\nvoice was half-choked with sobs, \"it was foolish to think that you would\nturn your back on a fellow who had just lived these past five years for\nyou.\"\n\n\"It isn't that, Andor,\" she murmured.\n\n\"It isn't that?\" he repeated dully, and once more the frown of awful\npuzzlement appeared between his dark, inquiring eyes. \"Then what is it?\nNo, no, Elsa!\" he added quickly, seeing that she threw a quick look of\npathetic anxiety upon him, \"don't be afraid, my dove. I am not going to\nmake a fool of myself again. You .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you are not prepared to marry me\njust now, perhaps .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. not just yet?--is that it? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. You have been\nangry with me. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I am not surprised at that .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you never got my\nletter .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you thought that I had forgotten you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and you want to\nget more used to me now that I am back .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. before we are properly\ntokened. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Is that it, Elsa? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I'll have to wait, eh?--till the\nspring, perhaps .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. till we have known one another better again .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nthen .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. perhaps .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHe was speaking jerkily, and always with that burning anxiety lurking in\nthe tone of his voice. But now he suddenly cried out like a poor\ncreature in pain, vehemently, appealingly, longing for one word of\ncomfort, one brief respite from this intolerable misery.\n\n\"But you don't speak, Elsa! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you don't speak. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. My God, why\ndon't you speak?\"\n\nAnd she replied slowly, monotonously, for now she seemed to have lost\neven the power of suffering pain. It was all so hopeless, so dreary, so\ndesolate.\n\n\"I can never marry you, Andor.\"\n\nHe stared at her almost like one demented, or as if he thought that she,\nperhaps, had lost her reason.\n\n\"I can never marry you,\" she repeated firmly, \"for I am tokened to Er\u00c3\u00b6s\nB\u00c3\u00a9la. My farewell banquet is to-day; to-morrow is my wedding day; the\nday after I go to my new home. I can never marry you, Andor. It is too\nlate.\"\n\nShe watched him while she spoke, vaguely wondering within her poor,\nbroken heart when that cry of agony would escape his lips. His face had\nbecome ghastly in hue, his mouth was wide open as if ready for that cry;\nhis twitching fingers clutched at the neckband of his shirt.\n\nBut the cry never came: the wound was too deep and too deadly for\noutward expression. He said nothing, and gradually his mouth closed and\nhis fingers ceased to twitch. Presently he rose, went to the door, and\npulled it open; he stood for a moment under the lintel, his arm leaning\nagainst the frame of the door, and the soft September breeze blew\nagainst his face and through his hair.\n\nFrom far away down the village street came the sound of laughter and of\nsinging. The people of Marosfalva were very merry to-day, for it was\nKapus Elsa's wedding time and Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la was being lavish with food and\nwine and music. Nobody guessed that in this one cottage sorrow, deep and\nlasting, had made a solemn entry and never meant to quit these two\nloving hearts again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\"He must make you happy.\"\n\n\nAndor shut the door once more. He did not want the people of the village\nto see him just now.\n\nHe turned back quietly into the room, and went to sit at his usual\nplace, across the corner of the table. Elsa, mechanically, absently, as\none whose mind and soul and heart are elsewhere, was smoothing out the\ncreases in her gown made wet by Andor's tears.\n\n\"How did it all come about, Elsa?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well, you know,\" she replied listlessly, \"since Klara Goldstein told\nyou--that everyone here believed that you were dead. I did not believe\nit myself for a long time, though I did think that if you had lived you\nwould have written to me. Then, as I had no news from you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. no news\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and mother always wished me to marry B\u00c3\u00a9la .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. why! I thought\nthat since you were dead nothing really mattered, and I might as well do\nwhat my mother wished.\"\n\n\"My God!\" he muttered under his breath.\n\n\"We were so poor at home,\" she continued, in that same listless,\napathetic voice, for indeed she seemed to have lost all capacity even\nfor suffering, \"and father was so ill .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. he wanted comfort and good\nfood, and mother and I could earn so very little .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. B\u00c3\u00a9la promised\nmother that nice house in the Kender Road, he promised to give her cows\nand pigs and chickens. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. What could I do? It is sinful not to obey\nyour parents .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and it seemed so selfish of me to nurse thoughts of\none whom I thought dead, when I could give my own mother and father all\nthe comforts they wanted just by doing what they wished. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I had to\nthink of father and mother, Andor. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. What could I do?\"\n\n\"That is so, Elsa,\" he assented, speaking very slowly and deliberately.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. \"That is so, of course .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I understand .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I ought to have\nknown .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. to have guessed something of the kind at any rate. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. My\nGod!\" he added, with renewed vehemence, \"but I do seem to have been an\naccursed fool!--thinking that everything would go on just the same while\nI was weaving my dreams out there on the other side of the globe. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nI ought to have guessed, I suppose, that they wouldn't leave you alone\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you the prettiest girl in the county. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"I held out as long as I could. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. But I felt that if you were dead\nnothing really mattered.\"\n\n\"My poor little dove,\" he whispered gently.\n\nGradually he felt a great calmness descending over him. It was her\nhelplessness that appealed to him, the pathos of her quiet resignation:\nhe felt how mean and unmanly it would be to give way to that rebellious\nrage which was burning in his veins. Three years under the orders of\nofttimes brutal petty officers had taught him a measure of\nself-restraint; the two further years of hard, unceasing toil under\nforeign climes, the patient amassing of florin upon florin to enable him\nto come back and claim the girl whom he loved, had completed the work of\nchanging an irresponsible, untrammelled child of these Hungarian plains\ninto a strong, well-balanced, well-controlled man of a wider world. His\nfirst instinct, when the terrible blow had been struck to all his hopes\nand all his happiness, had been the wild, unreasoning desire to strike\nback, and to kill. Had he been left to himself just then and then found\nhimself face to face with the man who had robbed him of Elsa, the\nsemi-civilization of the past five years would have fallen away from\nhim, he would once more have relapsed into the primeval, unfettered\nstate of his earlier manhood. The crude passions of these sons of the\nsoil are only feebly held in check by the laws of their land: at times\nthey break through their fetters, and then they are a law unto\nthemselves.\n\nBut Andor loved Elsa with a gentler and purer love than usually dwells\nin the heart of a man of his stamp. He had proved this during the past\nfive years spent in daily, hourly thoughts of her. Now that he found her\nin trouble, he would not add to her burden by parading his own before\nher.\n\nManlike, his first thought had been to kill, his second to seize his\nlove with both arms and to carry her away with him, away from this\nvillage, from this land, if need be. After all, she was not yet a wife,\nand the promise of marriage is not so sacred nor yet so binding as a\nmarriage vow.\n\nHe could carry her away, leaving the scandal-mongers to work their way\nwith her and him: he could carry her to that far-off land which he knew\nalready, where work was hard and money plentiful, and no one would have\nthe right to look down on her for what she had done. But seeing her\nthere, looking so helpless and so pathetic, he knew, by that unerring\nintuition which only comes to a man at such times as this, that such a\ndream could never be fulfilled. The future was as it was, as no doubt it\nhad been pre-ordained by God and by Fate: nothing that he could do or\nsay now would have the power to alter it. Tradition, filial duty and\nperhaps a certain amount of womanly weakness too, were all ranged up\nagainst him; but filial duty would fight harder than anything else and\nwould remain the conqueror in the end.\n\nThe relentless hand of the Inevitable was already upon him, and because\nof it, because of that vein of Oriental fatalism which survives in every\nHungarian peasant, the tumult in his soul had already subsided, and he\nwas able to speak to Elsa now with absolute gentleness.\n\n\"So to-day is your maiden's farewell, is it?\" he asked after awhile.\n\n\"Yes! It must be getting late,\" she said, as she rose from the low stool\nand shook out her many starched skirts, \"mother will be back directly to\nfetch me for the feast.\"\n\n\"It will be in the schoolroom, I suppose,\" he said indifferently.\n\n\"Yes. And some of the lads are coming over presently to fetch father.\nThey have arranged to carry him all the way. Isn't it good of them?\"\n\n\"To carry him all the way?\" he asked, puzzled.\n\n\"Father has not moved for two years,\" she said simply; \"he was stricken\nwith paralysis, you know.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes! Klara told me something about that.\"\n\n\"So in order to give me the pleasure of having father near me at my\nfarewell feast, M\u00c3\u00b3ritz and Jen\u00c3\u00b6 and Imre and Jank\u00c3\u00b3 are going to fasten\nlong poles to his chair and carry him to the schoolroom and back. Isn't\nit good of them? And I think they mean to do the same thing to-morrow\nand carry him to church. We are going to put his bunda round his\nshoulders. He has not worn his bunda for two years. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. It was\nyesterday, when I took it out in order to mend it, that I found the\nletter which you wrote me from Fiume. It had slipped between the pocket\nand the lining and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"And are you happy, Elsa?\" he broke in abruptly.\n\nShe hesitated almost imperceptibly for a moment, then she said quietly:\n\n\"Yes, Andor. I am fairly happy.\"\n\n\"B\u00c3\u00a9la?\" he asked again. \"Is he fond of you?\"\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"You are not sure?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" she said more firmly, \"I am quite sure.\"\n\n\"He hasn't taken to drinking, has he? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. He was a little inclined\nthat way at one time.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she said, with a shrug of her shoulders, \"I don't think that he\ndrinks more than other fellows of his age.\"\n\nShe went over to the window and somewhat ostentatiously, he thought,\nbegan turning over the contents of her work-box. There was something in\nher attitude now which worried him, and she seemed more determined than\never not to look him straight in the face.\n\n\"Elsa! I shall think the worst if you tell me nothing,\" he said firmly.\n\n\"There is nothing to tell, Andor.\"\n\n\"Yes, there is,\" he persisted; \"there is something about B\u00c3\u00a9la which\nmakes you unhappy and which you won't tell me. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Now, listen to me,\nElsa, for I mean every word which I am going to say .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I can bring\nmyself to the point of seeing you married to another man and happy in\nyour new home, even though my own heart will break in the process .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nbut what I could never stand would be to see you married to another man\nand made unhappy by him. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. So if you won't tell me what is on your\nmind with regard to B\u00c3\u00a9la, I will pick a quarrel with him this afternoon,\nand kill him if I can.\"\n\n\"Don't talk so wildly, Andor,\" she said, as she turned and faced him,\nfor she was a little frightened at his earnestness and knew that he had\nit in him to act just as he said he would. \"The whole thing is only\nfoolishness on my part, I know.\"\n\n\"Then there is something?\" he persisted obstinately.\n\n\"Well!\" she said, after a little more hesitation, \"it's only that he\nwill go hanging about at the Goldsteins' all the time.\"\n\n\"Oh! it's Klara, is it?\"\n\n\"I can't bear that girl,\" said Elsa, with sudden vehemence.\n\nHe looked at her keenly.\n\n\"You are jealous, Elsa,\" he said. \"Is it because you love B\u00c3\u00a9la?\"\n\n\"I don't like his hanging round Klara,\" she replied evasively.\n\nHe rose from the table, drawing in his breath as he did so, with a\ncurious hissing sound; perhaps the pain which he felt now was harder to\nbear even than that caused by the first crushing blow. The Inevitable\nhad indeed placed its cruel hand upon his happiness; not all the\nboundless wealth of his love, of his will and of his daring could ever\ngive Elsa back to him again.\n\n\"I had better go now, I suppose,\" he said.\n\n\"Mother will be here directly,\" she replied, \"won't you see her?\"\n\n\"Not just yet, I think. I thought of asking Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius if he could\ngive me a bed for a night. Pali b\u00c3\u00a1csi might not be ready for me yet.\"\n\n\"But you will come to my farewell feast?\" asked Elsa, with that\nunconscious cruelty of which good women are so often capable.\n\n\"If you wish it, Elsa,\" he replied.\n\n\"I do wish it,\" she said, \"and everyone will be so happy to see you.\nThey would think it strange if you did not come, for everyone will know\nby then that you have returned.\"\n\n\"Then I will come,\" he concluded.\n\nHe went up to her and held out his hand; she put her own upon it. Of\ncourse he did not ask for a kiss; he had no longer a right to that.\nSomehow, in the last few moments a barrier seemed to have sprung up\nbetween him and her which had obliterated all the past. He was a\nstranger now to her and she to him; that day five years ago was as if it\nhad never been. B\u00c3\u00a9la and her plighted troth to him stood now between\nAndor and that past which he must forget.\n\nBut as he stood now holding her hand, he looked at her earnestly, and\nher blue eyes, dimmed but serene, met his own gaze without flinching.\n\n\"The past, Elsa,\" he said, \"is done with. Henceforth we shall be nothing\nto one another. You will forget me easily enough. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I wish that I\nhad never come back to disturb the peace which I see is rapidly\nspreading over your life. My only wish now is that with you it should be\npeace. My heart has already given you up to B\u00c3\u00a9la--but not\nunconditionally, mind. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. He must make you happy .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I tell you\nthat he must,\" he reiterated, almost fiercely. \"If he does not, he will\nhave to reckon with me. Heaven help him, I say, if he is ever unkind to\nyou. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I shall see it, I shall know it. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I shall not leave this\nvillage till I am assured that he means to be kind--that he _is_ kind to\nyou, even though my heart should break in remaining a witness to your\nhappiness.\"\n\nHe stooped, and with the innate chivalry peculiar to the Hungarian\npeasantry, he kissed the small, cold hand which trembled in his grasp:\nhe kissed it as a noble lord would kiss the hand of a princess. Then,\nwithout looking on her again, he walked quietly out of the house, and\nElsa was alone with yet another bitter-sweet memory to add to her store\nof regrets.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\"It is true.\"\n\n\nBy the time that Andor turned the corner of the house into the street,\nhe found that the news of his arrival had already spread through the\nvillage like wildfire. Klara Goldstein's ready tongue had been at work\nthis past hour; she had quickly disseminated the news that the wanderer\nhad come home. She did not say that the malice and love of mischief in\nher had caused her to say nothing to Andor about Elsa's coming wedding.\nShe merely told the first neighbour whom she came across that Lakatos\nAndor had come back, just as she, for one, had always declared that he\nwould.\n\nAndor's friends had assembled in the street in a trice; here was too\nglorious an opportunity to shout and to sing and to make merry, to be\nlightly missed. And Andor had always been popular before. He was doubly\nso now that he had come back from America or wherever he may have been,\nand had made a fortune there; he shook one hundred and fifty hands\nbefore he could walk as far as the presbytery. The gypsies who had just\narrived by train from Arad were not allowed to proceed straight to the\nschoolroom. They were made to pause in the great open place before the\nchurch, made to unpack their instruments then and there, and to strike\nup the R\u00c3\u00a1k\u00c3\u00b3czy March without more ado, in honour of the finest son of\nMarosfalva, who had been thought dead by some, and had returned safe and\nsound to his native corner of the earth.\n\nIt was with much difficulty that at last Andor succeeded in effecting\nhis escape and running away from the series of ovations which greeted\nhim when and wherever he was recognized. The women embraced him without\nfurther ado, the men worried him to tell them some of his adventures\nthen and there. Above all, everyone wanted to hear how very much more\nwretched, uncomfortable and God-forsaken the rest of the wide, wide\nworld was in comparison with Hungary in general and the village of\nMarosfalva in particular.\n\nThe heartfelt, if noisy, greetings of his old friends had the effect of\nsoothing Andor's aching heart. The sight of his native village, the\nscent of the air, the dust of the road acted as a slight compensation\nfor the heavy load of sorrow which otherwise would hopelessly have\nweighed him down.\n\nWith a final wave of his hat he disappeared from the enraptured gaze of\nhis friends into the cool quietude of the presbytery garden. He stood\nstill for a moment behind a huge clump of tall sunflowers and gaudy\ndahlias to recover his breath and rearrange his coat, which had been\nmishandled quite a good deal by his friends in the excess of their joy.\n\nFrom the other side of the low gate came the buzz of animated talk, his\nown name oft-repeated, cries of surprise and of pleasure, when the news\nreached some late-comers, and through it all the soft, pathetic murmur\nof the gipsies' fiddles; they had lapsed from the inspiriting strains of\nthe R\u00c3\u00a1k\u00c3\u00b3czy March to one of the dreamy Magyar love-songs which suited\ntheir own languid Oriental temperament far better than the martial\nmusic.\n\nBut here, in the small presbytery garden, the world seemed to have\nslipped back an hundred years or more. Perfect peace! the drowsing of\nflies and wasps, the call of thrushes, the crackling of tiny twigs in\nthe branches of the old acacia tree in the corner! Only the flies and\nthe birds and the flowers seemed to live, and the air was heavy with the\npungent odour of the sunflowers.\n\nAndor drew a long breath. He seemed suddenly to wake from a long, long\ndream. It was just over five years ago that he had stood one morning\njust like this in this little garden; the late roses had not then ceased\nto bloom. It was the day before he had to leave Marosfalva in order to\nbecome a soldier, and he had come after Mass to say a private good-bye\nto the kind priest.\n\nNow it seemed as if those five years were just one long dream--the\nsoldiering, the voyage across the sea, the two years in a strange,\nstrange land, all culminating in that awful cataclysm which had for ever\nrobbed him of happiness.\n\nIt seemed as if it _could_ not all be true, as if Elsa was even now\nwaiting for him to go out for a walk under the acacia trees as she had\ndone on that morning five years ago. Even now he pulled the bell as he\nhad done then, and now--as then--Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius himself came to the\ndoor.\n\nHis old housekeeper had already brought the news to the presbytery of\nAndor's home-coming, and the old Pater was overjoyed at seeing the\nlad--now become so strong and so manly. He took Andor to his heart,\nchiefly because he would not have the lad see the tears which had so\nquickly come to his eyes.\n\n\"It is true then, Pater,\" said Andor, when he had followed the old man\ninto the little parlour all littered with papers and books. \"It is true,\nor you would not have cried when first you embraced me.\"\n\n\"What is true, my son?\" asked the Pater.\n\n\"That Elsa is to marry Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Yes, my son, that is true,\" said the priest simply.\n\nAnd thus Andor knew that, at any rate, the hideous present was not a\ndream.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\"That is fair, I think.\"\n\n\nAn hour later, Andor was in the street with the rest of the village\nfolk, watching Elsa as she walked up toward the schoolroom in the\ncompany of her mother. Her fair hair shone like the gold beads round her\nneck, and her starched petticoats swung out from her hips as she walked.\n\nShe held her head a little downcast; people thought this most becoming\nin a young bride; but Andor, who stood in the forefront of the\nspectators as she passed, saw that she held her head down because her\ncheeks were pale and her eyes swollen with tears.\n\nIrma n\u00c3\u00a9ni walked beside her daughter with the proud air of a queen, and\non ahead Barna M\u00c3\u00b3ritz, the mayor's second son, Feh\u00c3\u00a9r Jen\u00c3\u00b6, whose father\nworked the water-mill on the Maros, and two other sturdy fellows were\ncarrying the bride's paralysed father shoulder high in his chair.\n\nJust as the little procession halted for a moment before entering the\nwhitewashed school-house, Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la, the bridegroom and hero of the\nhour, appeared, coming from the opposite direction, and with Klara\nGoldstein, the Jewess, upon his arm.\n\nKlara--arrayed in fashionable town garments, with a huge hat covered in\nfeathers, a tight modern skirt that forced her to walk with mincing\nsteps, high-heeled shoes, open-work stockings and gloves reaching to the\nelbow--was indeed a curious apparition in amongst these peasant girls,\nwith their bare heads and high red-leather boots and petticoats standing\nround them like balloons.\n\nAndor frowned heavily when he caught sight of her; he had seen that\nElsa's pale cheeks had become almost livid in hue and that her parted\nlips trembled as if she were ready to cry.\n\nThe looks that were cast by the village folk upon the Jewess were none\ntoo kindly, and there were audible mutterings of disapproval at Er\u00c3\u00b6s\nB\u00c3\u00a9la's conduct; but neither looks nor mutterings disconcerted Klara\nGoldstein in the least. She knew well enough that envy of her\nfashionable attire bore a large share in the ill-will which was\ndisplayed against her, and the handsome Jewess, who so often had to bear\nthe contempt and the sneers of these Magyar peasants whom she despised,\nwas delighted that Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la's admiration for her had induced him to\ngive her an opportunity of queening it for once amongst them all.\n\nShe felt that she shone in her splendour in comparison with the\npale-faced bride in all her village finery. She carried a sunshade and a\nreticule, her dark hair was arranged in frisettes under her\nbroad-brimmed hat; she knew that the men were casting admiring glances\non her, and in any case, for the moment, she was the centre of universal\nobservation.\n\nWhilst some of the young men were engaged in carrying old Kapus into the\nhouse, a proceeding which kept the festive throng waiting outside, she\ntripped up daintily to Elsa, and said in soft, cooing tones:\n\n\"It was kind of you, my dear Elsa, to include me among your personal\nfriends on such an important occasion. As the young Count was saying to\nme only last night, 'You will give Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni and little Elsa vast\npleasure by your presence at the child's maiden's farewell, and mind\nyou wear that lovely hat which I admire so much.' So affable, the young\nCount, is he not? He told me that nothing would do but when I get\nmarried he must come himself to every feast in connection with my\nwedding.\"\n\nBut once she had delivered these several little pointed shafts, Klara\nGoldstein was far too clever to wait for a retort. Before Elsa, whose\nsimple mind was not up to a stinging repartee, could think of something\nindifferent or not too ungracious to say, the handsome Jewess had\nalready spied Andor's face among the crowd.\n\n\"There is the hero of the hour, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" she said, turning to the\nbridegroom, who had stood by surly and defiant; \"these past five years\nhave not changed him much, eh? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Your future wife's old sweetheart,\"\nshe added, with a malicious little laugh; \"are you not pleased to see\nhim?\"\n\nThen, as B\u00c3\u00a9la somewhat clumsily, and with a pretence at cordiality which\nhe was far from feeling, went up to Andor and held out his hand to him,\nKlara continued glibly:\n\n\"Poor old Andor! he is a trifle glum now. I never told him that his\nsweetheart was getting married to-morrow. Never mind, my little Andor,\"\nshe added, turning her expressive dark eyes with a knowing look upon the\nyoung man; \"there is more fish in the Maros than has come out of it. And\nI thought that you would prefer to get the truth direct from our pretty\nElsa!\"\n\n\"I think you did quite right, Klara,\" said Andor indifferently.\n\nBut in the meanwhile B\u00c3\u00a9la had contrived to come up quite close to Elsa,\nand to whisper hurriedly in her ear:\n\n\"A bargain's a bargain, my dove!--you behave amiably to Klara Goldstein\nand I will keep a civil tongue in my head for your old sweetheart.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. That is fair, I think, eh, Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni?\" he added, turning to the\nold woman.\n\n\"Don't be foolish, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" retorted Kapus Irma dryly. \"Why you should be\nfor ever teasing Elsa, I cannot think. You must know that all girls feel\nupset at these times, and as like as not you'll make her cry at her own\nfeast. And that would be a fine disgrace for us all!\"\n\n\"Don't be afraid, mother,\" said Elsa quietly; \"I don't feel the least\nlike crying.\"\n\n\"That's splendid,\" exclaimed B\u00c3\u00a9la, with ostentatious gaiety. \"Here's\nIrma n\u00c3\u00a9ni trying to teach me something about girls. As if I didn't know\nabout them all that there is to know. Eh, Andor, you agree with me,\ndon't you?\" he added, turning to the other man. \"We men know more about\nwomen's moods and little tempers than their own mothers do. What? Now,\nIrma n\u00c3\u00a9ni, take your daughter into the house. There is a clatter of\ndishes and bottles going on inside there which is very pleasant to the\nstomach. Miss Klara, will you honour me by accepting my arm? Friends,\ncome in all, will you? All those, I mean, whom my wife that is to be has\ninvited to her last girlhood's entertainment. Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni, do lead the\nway. Elsa looks quite pale for want of food--she had her breakfast very\nearly, I suppose, and got tired dressing for this great occasion. Andor,\nyou shall sit next to Elsa if you like. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. You must have lots to tell\nher. Your adventures among the cannibals and the lions and tigers. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nEh? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. And Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni shall sit next to you on the other side, and\ndon't let her have more wine than is good for her. Whew! but it is hot\nalready! Come along, friends. By thunder, Klara, but that is a fine hat\nyou have got on.\"\n\nHe talked on very volubly and at the top of his voice, making\nostentatious efforts to appear jovial and amiable to everyone; but Er\u00c3\u00b6s\nB\u00c3\u00a9la was no fool: he knew quite well that his attitude toward his bride\nand toward Klara the Jewess was causing many adverse comments to go\nround among his friends. But he was in a mood not to care. He was\ndetermined that everyone should know and see that he was the master here\nto-day, just as he meant to be master in his house throughout the years\nto come. Like every self-enriched peasant, he attached an enormous\nimportance to wealth, and was inclined to have a contempt for the less\nfortunate folk who had not risen out of their humble sphere as he had\ndone.\n\nHis wealth, he thought, had placed him above everyone else in\nMarosfalva, and above the unwritten laws of traditions and proprieties\nwhich are of more account in an Hungarian village than all the codes\nframed by the Parliament which sits in Budapesth. He was proud of his\nwealth, proud of his education, his book-learning and knowledge of the\nworld, and reckoned that these gave him the right to be a law unto\nhimself. His naturally domineering and masterful temperament completed\nhis claim to be considered the head man of Marosfalva.\n\nThe Hungarian peasants are ready enough to give deference where\ndeference is exacted, but, having given it, their cordial friendship\ndies away. They acknowledged a social barrier more readily, perhaps,\nthan any other peasantry in Europe, but having once acknowledged it,\nthey will not admit that either party can stand on both sides of it at\none and the same time.\n\nSo now, though Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la was flouting the local traditions and\nproprieties by his attentions to Klara Goldstein, no one thought of\nopenly opposing him. Everyone was ready enough to accept his actions, as\nthey would those of their social superiors--the gentlemen of Arad, the\nPater, my lord the Count himself, but they were not ready to accept his\ncordiality nor to extend to him their simple-minded and open-hearted\nfriendship.\n\nThe presence of the Jewess did not please them--she was a stranger and\nan alien--she looked like a creature from another world with her tight\nskirts, high-heeled shoes and huge, feathered hat. No one felt this more\nkeenly than Andor, whose heart had warmed out--despite its pain--at\nsight of all his friends, their national costumes, their music, their\ntraditions--all of which had been out of his life for so long.\n\nHe felt that Klara's presence on this occasion was in itself an outrage\nupon Elsa, even without B\u00c3\u00a9la's conspicuously unworthy conduct. Elsa,\nwith her tightly-plaited hair, her balloon skirts and bare neck and\narms, looked ashamed beside this fashionable apparition all made up of\nbillowy lace and clinging materials.\n\nAndor cursed beneath his breath, and ground his heel into the dust in\nthe impotency of his rage. He tried to remember all that the Pater had\nsaid to him half an hour ago about forbearance and about God's will.\n\nPersonally, Andor did not altogether believe that it was God's will that\nElsa should be married to a man who would neither cherish her nor\nappreciate her as she deserved to be: and it was with a heart weighed\ndown with foreboding as well as with sorrow that he followed the wedding\nparty into the school-house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\"The waters of the Maros flow sluggishly.\"\n\n\nBut even the bridegroom's unconventional and reprehensible conduct had\nnot the power to damp for long the spirits of the guests.\n\nBy the time the soup had been eaten and the glasses filled with wine,\nthe noise in the schoolroom had already become deafening, and no person\nof moderate vocal calibre could have heard himself speak. The time had\ncome for everyone to talk at the top of his or her voice, for no one to\nlisten, and for laughter--irresponsible, immoderate laughter--to ring\nfrom end to end of the room.\n\nThe gipsies were scraping their fiddles, blowing their clarionets and\nbanging their czimbalom with all the vigour of which they were capable.\nThey, at any rate, were determined to be heard above the din. The\nleader, with his violin under his chin, had already begun his round of\nthe two huge tables, pausing for awhile behind every chair--just long\nenough to play into the ear of every single guest his or her favourite\nsong.\n\nFor thus custom demands it.\n\nThere are hundreds and hundreds of Hungarian folk-songs, and to a\nstranger's ear no doubt these have a great similarity among themselves,\nbut to a Hungarian there is a world of difference in each: for to him it\nis the words that have a meaning. The songs are, for the most part,\nlove-songs, and all are written in that quaint, symbolic style, full of\npoetic imagery, which is peculiar to the Magyar language.\n\nWhen we remember that in the terrible revolution of '48, when these same\nHungarian peasant lads who composed the bulk of Kossuth's followers\nfought against the Austrian army, and subsequently against the combined\narmies of Russia and of Austria, when we remember that throughout that\nterrible campaign they were always accompanied by their gipsy bands, we\nbegin to realize how great a part national music plays in the national\nspirit of Hungary. The sweet, sad folk-songs rang in the fighting lads'\nears when they fell in their hundreds before the superior arms and\nnumbers of their powerful neighbours, they inspired them and urged them,\nthey helped them to win while they could, and to yield only when\noverwhelming numbers finally crushed their powers of resistance. Gipsy\nmusicians fell beside the young soldiers, playing to them until the last\nthe songs that spoke to them of their village, their sweethearts and\ntheir home. And the sweet, sad strains rang in the ears of the lads when\nthey closed their eyes in death.\n\nAnd now when Andor--face to face with the first great sorrow of his\nlife--felt as if his heart must break under it, he loved to hear the\ngipsy musician softly caressing the strings of his violin as he played\nclose to his ear the sweetest, saddest melody among all the sweet, sad\nmelodies in the Magyar tongue. It begins thus:\n\n    \"A Maros vize folyik csendesen!\"\n\n    \"The waters of the Maros flow sluggishly--\"\n\nand it speaks of a broken-hearted lover whose sweetheart belongs to\nanother. Andor had never cared for it before. He used to think it too\nsad, but now he understood it: it was attuned to his mood, and the soft\nsound of the instrument helped him to keep his ever-growing wrath in\ncheck, even while he was watching Elsa's pale, tearful face.\n\nShe had made pathetic efforts to remain cheerful and not to listen to\nKlara's strident voice and loud, continuous laughter. B\u00c3\u00a9la had\npractically confined his attentions to the Jewess, and Elsa tried not to\nshow how ashamed she was at being so openly neglected on this occasion.\nShe should have been the queen of the feast, of course; the bridegroom's\nthoughts should have been only for her; everyone's eyes should have been\nturned on her. Instead of which she seemed of less consequence almost\nthan anyone else here. If it had not been for Andor, who sat next to her\nand who saw to her having something to eat and drink--it was little\nenough, God knows!--she might have sat here like a wooden doll.\n\nSomething of the respect which Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la demanded as his own right\nencompassed her, too, already: the cordiality of the past seemed to have\nvanished. She was already something of a lady: \"_ten's asszony_\"\n(honoured madam), she would be styled by and by. And this foreknowledge,\nwhich she was gradually imbibing while everybody round her made merry,\ncaused her almost as much sadness as B\u00c3\u00a9la's indifference towards her. It\nseemed as if all brightness was destined to go out of her life after\nto-day, and it was with tear-filled eyes that she looked up now and\nagain from her plate and gazed round upon the festive scene before her.\n\nThe whitewashed schoolroom, where on ordinary working days brown and\ngrimy little faces were wont to pore laboriously over slates and books,\npresented now a very lively appearance.\n\nTwo huge trestle tables ran down its length, and thirty guests were\nseated on benches each side of these. The girls in all their finery\nwanted a deal of sitting-room, with their starched petticoats standing\nout over their hips, and their bare arms and necks shone with the\nvigorous application of yellow soap: and the smooth hair, fair and dark,\nhad an additional lustre after the stiff brushing which it had to\nendure. The matrons wore darker skirts and black silk handkerchiefs tied\nround their heads, ending in a bow under the chin: but everywhere\nribbons fluttered and beads jingled, and the men had spurs to their high\nboots which gave a pleasing clinking when they clapped their heels\ntogether. Overhead, hung to the ceiling, were festoons of bright pink\npaper roses and still brighter green glazed calico leaves; the tables\nwere spread with linen cloths, and literally threatened to break down\nunder the weight of pewter dishes filled with delicacies of every sort\nand kind--home-killed meat and home-made sausages, home-made bread and\nhome-grown wine. The Magyar peasant is an epicure. His rich soil and\nexcellent climate give him the best of food, and though, when times are\nhard, he will live readily enough on maize bread and pumpkin, he knows\nhow to enjoy a good spread when rich friends provide it for him.\n\nAnd Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la had done the feast in style. Nothing was stinted. You just\nhad to sit down and eat your fill of roast veal or roast pork, of\nfattened capons from his farmyard or of fogas[4] from the river, or of\nthe scores of dishes of all kinds of good things which stood temptingly\nabout.\n\n[Footnote 4: A kind of pike peculiar to Hungarian rivers.]\n\nNo wonder that spirits were now running high. The gipsy band was quite\nsplendid, and presently Barna M\u00c3\u00b3ritz, the second son of the mayor--a\nsmart young man who would go far--was on his feet proposing the health\nof the bride.\n\nWell! Of course! One mugful was not enough to do honour to such a toast,\nthey had to be refilled and then filled up again: wine was so plentiful\nand so good--not heady, but just a delicious white wine which tasted of\nnothing but the sweet-scented grape. Soon the bridegroom rose to\nrespond, whereupon Feh\u00c3\u00a9r Jen\u00c3\u00b6, whose father rented the mill from my lord\nthe Count, loudly desired that everyone should drink the health of\nhappy, lucky Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la, and then, of course, the latter had to respond\nagain.\n\nElsa felt more and more every moment a stranger among them all.\nFortunately the innate kindliness of these children of the soil\nprevented any chaffing remarks being made about the silence of the\nbride. It is always an understood thing that brides are shy and nervous,\nand though there had been known cases in Marosfalva where a bride had\nbeen very lively and talkative at her \"maiden's farewell\" it was, on the\nwhole, considered more seemly to preserve a semi-tearful attitude,\nseeing that a girl on the eve of her marriage is saying good-bye to her\nparents and to her home.\n\nThe bridegroom's disgraceful conduct was tacitly ignored: it could not\nbe resented or even commented on without quarrelling with Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la, and\nthat no one was prepared to do. You could not eat a man's salt and drink\nhis wine and then knock him on the head, which it seemed more than one\nlad--who had fancied himself in love with beautiful Kapus Elsa--was\nsorely inclined to do.\n\nKapus Benk\u00c3\u00b3, in his invalid's chair, sat some distance away from his\ndaughter, the other side of Klara Goldstein. Elsa could not even\nexchange glances with him or see whether he had everything he wanted.\nThus she seemed cut off from everyone she cared for; only Andor was near\nher, and of Andor she must not even think. She tried not to meet his\ngaze, tried hard not to feel a thrill of pleasure every time that she\nbecame actively conscious of his presence beside her.\n\nAnd yet it was good to feel that he was there, she had a sense that she\nwas being protected, that things could not go very wrong while he was\nnear.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\"I am here to see that you be kind to her.\"\n\n\nPater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius came in at about four o'clock to remind all these\nchildren of their duty to God.\n\nTo-day was the vigil of St. Michael and All Angels, there would be\nvespers at half-past four, and the bride and bridegroom should certainly\nfind the time to go to church for half an hour and thank the good God\nfor all His gifts.\n\nThe company soon made ready to go after that. Everyone there intended to\ngo to church, and in the meanwhile the gipsies would have the remnants\nof the feast, after which they would instal themselves in the big barn\nand dancing could begin by about six.\n\nBride and bridegroom stood side by side, close to the door, as the\nguests filed out both singly and in pairs, and as they did so they shook\neach one by the hand, wished them good health after the repast, and\nbegged their company for the dancing presently and the wedding feast on\nthe morrow. Once more the invalid father, hoisted up on the shoulders of\nthe same sturdy lads, led the procession out of the school-house, then\nfollowed all the guests, helter-skelter, young men and maids, old men\nand matrons.\n\nThe wide petticoats got in the way, the men were over bold in squeezing\nthe girls' waists in the general scramble, there was a deal of laughing\nand plenty of shouting as hot, perspiring hands were held out one by one\nto Elsa and to B\u00c3\u00a9la, and voices, hoarse with merriment, proffered the\ntraditional \"_Eg\u00c3\u00a9ss\u00c3\u00a9gire!_\" (your very good health!), and then, like so\nmany birds let out of a cage, streamed out of the narrow door into the\nsunlit street.\n\nAndor had acquitted himself of the same duty, and Elsa's cool little\nhand had rested for a few seconds longer than was necessary in his own\nbrown one. She had murmured the necessary words of invitation for the\nceremonies on the morrow, and he was still standing in the doorway when\nKlara Goldstein was about to take her leave.\n\nKlara had stayed very ostentatiously to the last, just as if she were\nthe most intimate friend or an actual member of the family; she had\nstood beside B\u00c3\u00a9la during the general exodus, her small, dark head,\ncrowned with the gorgeous picture hat, held a little on one side, her\ntwo gloved hands resting upon the handle of her parasol, her foot in its\ndainty shoe impatiently tapping the ground.\n\nAs the crowd passed by, scrambling in their excitement, starched\npetticoats crumpled, many a white shirt stained with wine, hot,\nperspiring and panting, a contemptuous smile lingered round her thin\nlips, and from time to time she made a remark to B\u00c3\u00a9la--always in German,\nso that the village folk could not understand. But Andor, who had\nlearned more than his native Hungarian during his wanderings abroad,\nheard these sneering remarks, and hated the girl for speaking them, and\nB\u00c3\u00a9la for the loud laugh with which he greeted each sally.\n\nNow she held out her small, thin hand to Elsa.\n\n\"Your good health, my dear Elsa!\" she said indifferently.\n\nAfter an obvious moment of hesitation, Elsa put her toil-worn, shapely\nlittle hand into the gloved one for an instant and quickly withdrew it\nagain. There was a second or two of silence. Klara did not move: she was\nobviously waiting for the invitation which had been extended to everyone\nelse.\n\nA little nervously she began toying with her parasol.\n\n\"The glass is going up; you will have fine weather for your wedding\nto-morrow,\" she said more pointedly.\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Elsa softly.\n\nAnother awkward pause. Andor, who stood in the doorway watching the\nlittle scene, saw that B\u00c3\u00a9la was digging his teeth into his underlip, and\nthat his one eye had a sinister gleam in it as it wandered from one girl\nto the other.\n\n\"May the devil! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" began Klara roughly, whose temper quickly got the\nbetter of her airs and graces. \"What kind of flea has bitten your bride,\nB\u00c3\u00a9la, I should like to know?\"\n\n\"Flea?\" said B\u00c3\u00a9la with an oath, which he did not even attempt to\nsuppress. \"Flea? No kind of a flea, I hope. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Look here, my dove,\"\nhe added, turning to Elsa suddenly, \"you seem to be forgetting your\nduties--have you gone to sleep these last five minutes?--or can't you\nsee that Klara is waiting.\"\n\n\"I can see that Klara is waiting,\" replied Elsa calmly, \"but I don't\nknow what she can be waiting for.\"\n\nShe was as white as the linen of her shift, and little beads of sweat\nstood out at the roots of her hair. Andor, whose love for her made him\nclear-sighted and keen, saw the look of obstinacy which had crept round\nher mouth--the sudden obstinacy of the meek, which nothing can move. He\nalone could see what this sudden obstinacy meant to her, whose natural\ninstincts were those of duty and of obedience. She suffered terribly at\nthis moment, both mentally and physically; the moisture of her forehead\nshowed that she suffered.\n\nBut she had nerved herself up for this ordeal: the crushed worm was\nturning on the cruel foot that had trodden it for so long. She did not\nmean to give way, even though she had fully weighed in the balance all\nthat she would have to pay in the future for this one moment of\nrebellion.\n\nParents first and husbands afterwards are masterful tyrants in this part\nof the world; the woman's place is to obey; the Oriental conception of\nman's supremacy still reigns paramount, especially in the country. Elsa\nknew all this, and was ready for the chastisement--either moral, mental\nor even physical--which would surely overtake her, if not to-day, then\ncertainly after to-morrow.\n\n\"You don't know what Klara is waiting for?\" asked B\u00c3\u00a9la, with an evil\nsneer; \"why, my dove, you must be dreaming. Klara won't come to our\nchurch, of course, but she would like to come to the ball presently, and\nto-morrow to our wedding feast.\"\n\nA second or perhaps less went by while Elsa passed her tongue over her\nparched lips; then she said slowly:\n\n\"Since Klara does not go to our church, B\u00c3\u00a9la, I don't think that she can\npossibly want to come to our wedding feast.\"\n\nB\u00c3\u00a9la swore a loud and angry oath, and Andor, who was closely watching\neach player in this moving little drama, saw that Klara's olive skin had\ntaken on a greenish hue, and that her gloved hands fastened almost\nconvulsively over the handle of her parasol.\n\n\"But I tell you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" began B\u00c3\u00a9la, who was now livid with rage, and\nturned with a menacing gesture upon his fianc\u00c3\u00a9e, \"I tell you that .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nAlready Andor had interposed; he, too, was pale and menacing, but he did\nnot raise his voice nor did he swear, he only asked very quietly:\n\n\"What will you tell your fianc\u00c3\u00a9e, man? Come! What is it that you want\nto tell her on the eve of her wedding day?\"\n\n\"What's that to you?\" retorted B\u00c3\u00a9la.\n\nIn this land where tempers run high, and blood courses hotly through the\nveins, a quarrel swiftly begun like this more often than not ends in\ntragedy. On Andor's face, in his menacing eyes, was writ the\ndetermination to kill if need be; in that of B\u00c3\u00a9la there was the vicious\nsnarl of an infuriated dog. Klara Goldstein was far too shrewd and\nprudent to allow her name to be mixed up in this kind of quarrel. Her\nreputation in the village was not an altogether unblemished one; by a\nscandal such as would result from a fight between these two men and for\nsuch a cause she might hopelessly jeopardize her chances in life, even\nwith her own people.\n\nHer own common sense, too, of which she had a goodly share, told her at\nthe same time that the game was not worth the candle: the satisfaction\nof being asked to the most important wedding in the village, and there\nqueening it with her fashionable clothes and with the bridegroom's\nundivided attention over a lot of stupid village folk, would not really\ncompensate her for the scandal that was evidently brewing in the minds\nof Andor and of Elsa.\n\nSo she preferred for the nonce to play the part of outraged innocence, a\npart which she further emphasized by the display of easy-going\nkindliness. She placed one of her daintily-gloved hands on B\u00c3\u00a9la's arm,\nshe threw him a look of understanding and of indulgence, she cast a\nprovoking glance on Andor and one of good-humoured contempt on Elsa,\nthen she said lightly:\n\n\"Never mind, B\u00c3\u00a9la! I can see that our little Elsa is a trifle nervy\nto-day; she does me more honour than I deserve by resenting your great\nkindness to me. But bless you, my good B\u00c3\u00a9la! I don't mind. I am used to\njealousies: the petty ones of my own sex are quite endurable; it is when\nyou men are jealous that we poor women often have to suffer. Leopold\nHirsch, who is courting me, you know, is so madly jealous at times. He\nscarce can bear anyone to look at me. As if I could help not being\nplain, eh?\"\n\nThen she turned with a smile to Elsa.\n\n\"I don't think, my dear,\" she said dryly, \"that you are treating B\u00c3\u00a9la\nquite fairly. He won't let you suffer from his jealousies; why should\nyou annoy him with yours?\"\n\nAnother glance through her long, dark lashes on both the men, and Klara\nGoldstein turned to go. But before she could take a step toward the\ndoor, B\u00c3\u00a9la's masterful hand was on her wrist.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" he asked roughly.\n\n\"Going, my good B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" she replied airily, \"going. What else can I do? I\nam not wanted here now, or later at your feast; but there are plenty in\nthis village and around it who will make me welcome, and their company\nwill be more pleasing to me, I assure you, than that of your friends. We\nthought of having some tarok[5] this evening. Leopold will be with us,\nand the young Count is coming. He loves a gamble, and is most amusing\nwhen he is in the mood. So I am going where I shall be most welcome, you\nsee.\"\n\n[Footnote 5: A game of cards--the source of much gambling in that part\nof Europe.]\n\nShe tried to disengage her wrist, but he was holding her with a tight,\nnervous grip.\n\n\"You are not going to do anything of the sort,\" he muttered hoarsely;\n\"she is daft, I tell you. Stay here, can't you?\"\n\n\"Not I,\" she retorted, with a laugh. \"Enough of your friends' company,\nmy good B\u00c3\u00a9la, is as good as a feast. Look at Elsa's face! And Andor's!\nHe is ready to eat me, and she to freeze the marrow in my bones. So\nfarewell, my dear man; if you want any more of my company,\" she added\npointedly, \"you know where to get it.\"\n\nShe had succeeded in freeing her wrist, and the next moment was standing\nunder the lintel of the door, the afternoon sun shining full upon her\nclinging gown, her waving feathers and the gew-gaws which hung round her\nneck. For a moment she stood still, blinking in the glare, her hands,\nwhich trembled a little from the emotion of the past little scene,\nfumbled with her parasol.\n\nB\u00c3\u00a9la turned like a snarling beast upon his fianc\u00c3\u00a9e.\n\n\"Ask her to stop,\" he cried savagely. \"Ask her to stop, I tell you!\"\n\n\"Keep your temper, my good B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" said Klara over her shoulder to him,\nwith a laugh; \"and don't trouble about me. I am used to tantrums at\nhome. Leo is a terror when he has a jealous fit, but it's nothing to me,\nI assure you! His rage leaves me quite cold.\"\n\n\"But this sort of nonsense does not leave me cold,\" retorted B\u00c3\u00a9la, who\nby now was in a passion of fury; \"it makes my blood boil, I tell you.\nWhat I've said, I've said, and I'm not going to let any woman set her\nwill up against mine, least of all the woman who is going to be my wife.\nWhether you go or stay, Klara, is your affair, but Elsa will damn well\nhave to ask you to stay, as I told her to do; she'll have to do as I\ntell her, or .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Or what, B\u00c3\u00a9la?\" interposed Andor quietly.\n\nB\u00c3\u00a9la threw him a dark and sullen look, like an infuriated bull that\npauses just before it is ready to charge.\n\n\"What is it to you?\" he muttered savagely.\n\n\"Only this, my friend,\" replied Andor, who seemed as calm as the other\nwas heated with passion, \"only this: that I courted and loved Elsa when\nshe was younger and happier than she is now, and I am not going to stand\nby and see her bullied and brow-beaten by anyone. Understand?\"\n\n\"Take care, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" laughed Klara maliciously; \"your future wife's old\nsweetheart might win her from you yet.\"\n\n\"Take care of what?\" shouted B\u00c3\u00a9la in unbridled rage. He faced Andor, and\nhis one sinister eye shot a glance of deadly hatred upon him. \"Let me\ntell you this, my friend, Lakatos Andor. I don't know where you have\nsprung from to-day, or why you have chosen to-day to do it .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and\nit's nothing to me. But understand that I don't like your presence here,\nand that I did not invite you to come, and that therefore you have no\nbusiness to be here, seeing that I pay for the feast. And understand too\nthat I'll trouble my future wife's sweetheart to relieve her of his\npresence in future, or there'll be trouble. And you may take that from\nme, as my last word, my friend. Understand?\"\n\n\"What an ass you are, B\u00c3\u00a9la!\" came as a parting shot from Klara, who had\nsucceeded in opening her parasol, and now stood out in the open, her\nface and shoulders in shadow, looking the picture of coolness and of\ngood-temper.\n\n\"Andor,\" she added, with a pleasing smile to the young man, \"you know\nyour way to Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein's. Father and I will be pleased to see you\nthere at any time. The young Count will be there to-night, and we'll\nhave some tarok. Farewell, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" she continued, laughing merrily.\n\"Don't worry, my good man, it's not worth losing your temper about\ntrifles on the eve of your wedding-day. And bless your eyes! I don't\nmind.\"\n\nThen she swept a mock curtsy to Elsa.\n\n\"Farewell, my pretty one. Good luck to you in your new life.\"\n\nShe nodded and was gone. Her rippling laugh, with its harsh, ironical\nring was heard echoing down the village street.\n\n\"Call her back!\" shouted B\u00c3\u00a9la savagely, turning on his fianc\u00c3\u00a9e.\n\nShe looked him straight in that one eye which was so full of menace, and\nsaid with meek but firm obstinacy:\n\n\"I will not.\"\n\n\"Call her back,\" he exclaimed, \"you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHe was almost choking with rage, and now he raised his clenched fist and\nbrandished it in her face.\n\n\"Call her back, or I'll .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nBut already Andor was upon him, had seized him by collar and wrist. He\nwas as livid as the other man was crimson, but his eyes glowed with a\nfury at least as passionate.\n\n\"And I tell you,\" he said, speaking almost in a whisper, very slowly and\nvery calmly, but with such compelling power of determination that B\u00c3\u00a9la,\ntaken unawares, half-choked with the grip on his throat, and in agonized\npain with the rough turn on his wrist, was forced to cower before him,\n\"I tell you that if you dare touch her .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Look here, my friend,\" he\ncontinued, more loudly, \"just now you said that you didn't know where\nI'd sprung from to-day, or why I chose to-day in which to do it. Well!\nLet me tell you then. God in Heaven sent me, do you see? He sent me to\nbe here so as to see that no harm come to Elsa through marrying a brute\nlike you. You have shown me the door, and I don't want to eat your salt\nagain and to take your hospitality, for it would choke me, I know .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nbut let me tell you this much, that if you bully Elsa .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. if you\ndon't make her happy .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. if you are not kind to her .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I'll make\nyou regret it to your dying day.\"\n\nHe had gradually relaxed his hold on B\u00c3\u00a9la's throat and wrist, and now\nthe latter was able to free himself altogether, and to readjust his\ncollar and the set of his coat. For a moment it almost seemed as if he\nfelt ashamed and repentant. But his obstinate and domineering temper\nquickly got the better of this softened mood.\n\n\"You'll make me regret it, will you?\" he retorted sullenly. \"You think\nthat you will be allowed to play the guardian angel here, eh? with all\nyour fine talk of God in Heaven, which I am inclined to think even the\nPater would call blasphemy. I know what's at the back of your mind, my\nfriend, don't you make any mistake about that.\"\n\n\"You know what's at the back of my mind?\" queried Andor, with a puzzled\nfrown. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean,\" said B\u00c3\u00a9la, with a return to his former swagger, \"that you have\nbeen saying to yourself this past half-hour: 'Oho! but Elsa is not\nmarried yet! The vows are not yet spoken, and until they are I still\nhave my chance.' That's what you have been saying to yourself, eh, Mr.\nGuardian Angel?\"\n\n\"You d----d liar!\"\n\n\"Oh! insulting me won't help you, my friend. And I am not going to let\nyou provoke me into a fight, and kill me perhaps, for no doubt that is\nwhat you would like to do. I am not going to give Elsa up to you, you\nneed not think it; and you can't take her from me, you can't make her\nbreak her solemn promise to me, without covering her with a disgrace\nfrom which she would never recover. You know what happened when Bak\u00c3\u00b3\nMariska broke off her marriage on the eve of her wedding-day, just\nbecause Lajos had got drunk once or twice? Though her mother whipped\nher for her obstinacy, and her father broke his stick across her\nshoulders, the whole countryside turned against her. They all had to\nleave the village, for no one would speak to Mariska. A scandal such as\nthat the ignorant peasants round about here will never forgive. Mariska\nultimately drowned herself in the Maros: when she no longer could stand\nthe disgrace that pursued her everywhere. When you thought that to make\na girl break off her engagement the day before her wedding was such an\neasy matter, you had not thought of all that, had you, my friend?\"\n\n\"And when you thought of frightening me by all that nonsensical talk,\"\nretorted Andor quietly, \"you had not thought perhaps that there are\nother lands in the world besides Hungary, and that I am not quite such\nan ignorant peasant as those whom you choose to despise. But you have\nbeen wasting your breath and your temper. I am not here to try and\npersuade Elsa into doing what she would think wrong; but I am here to\nsee that at least you be kind to her.\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" ejaculated B\u00c3\u00a9la, with a contemptuous snap of his fingers.\n\n\"Oh! you need not imagine that I wouldn't know how you treated her. I\nwould know soon enough. I tell you,\" he continued, with slow and\ndeliberate emphasis, \"that what you do to her I shall know. I shall know\nif you bully her, I shall know if you make her unhappy. I shall\nknow--and God help you in that case!--if you are not kind to her. Just\nthink in future when you speak a rough word to her that Lakatos Andor\nwill hear you and make you pay for every syllable. Think when you\nbrowbeat her that Lakatos Andor can see you! For I _will_ see you, I\ntell you, in spite of your turning me out of your house, in spite of\nyour fences and your walls. So just you ask her pardon now for your\nroughness, kiss her little hand and take her to vespers. But take this\nfrom me, my friend, that if you ever dare raise your hand against your\nwife I'll pay you out for it, so help me God!\"\n\nHe had sworn the last oath with solemn earnestness. Now he turned to\nElsa and took her cold little hand in his and kissed her trembling\nfinger-tips, then, without another look on the man whom he hated with\nsuch an overwhelming and deadly hatred, he turned on his heel and fled\nprecipitately from the room.\n\nB\u00c3\u00a9la stood sullen and silent for a moment after he had gone. Wrath was\nstill heating his blood so that the veins in his forehead stood up like\ncords. But he was not only wrathful, he also felt humiliated and\nashamed. He had been cowed and overmastered in the presence of Elsa. His\nswagger and domineering ways had availed him nothing. Andor had\nthreatened him and he had not had the pluck or the presence of mind to\nstand up to that meddling, interfering peasant.\n\nNow it was too late to do anything; the thoughts of retaliation which\nwould come to his mind later on had not yet had the time to mature. All\nthat he knew was that he hated Andor and would get even with him some\nday; for Elsa he felt no hatred, only a great wrath that she should have\nwitnessed his humiliation and that her obstinacy should have triumphed\nagainst his will. The same pride in her and the same loveless desire was\nstill in him. He did not hate her, but he meant to make her suffer for\nwhat he had just gone through. To him matrimony meant the complete\nsubjection of the woman to the will of her lord; for every rebellion,\nfor every struggle against that subjection she must be punished in\naccordance with the gravity of her fault.\n\nElsa had caused him to be humiliated, and it was his firm resolve to\nhumiliate her before many hours had gone by. Already a plan was forming\nin his brain; the quietude of vespers would, he thought, help him to\ncomplete it.\n\nOutside, the lads and maids were loudly demanding the appearance of the\nbride and bridegroom: the vesper bell had long ago ceased its compelling\ncall. Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la offered his silent fianc\u00c3\u00a9e his arm. She took it without\nhesitation, and together they walked across the square to the church.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\"I must punish her.\"\n\n\nThe little village inn kept by Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein was not more squalid,\nnot more dark and stuffy, than are the village inns of most countries in\nEurope. Klara did her best to keep the place bright and clean, which was\nno easy matter when the roads were muddy and men brought in most of the\nmud of those roads on their boots, and deposited it on the\nfreshly-washed floors.\n\nThe tap-room was low and narrow and dark. Round the once whitewashed\nwalls there were rows of wooden benches with narrow trestle tables in\nfront of them. Opposite the front door, on a larger table, were the\nbottles of wine and silvorium,[6] the jars of tobacco and black cigars,\nwhich a beneficent government licensed Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein the Jew to sell\nto the peasantry.\n\n[Footnote 6: A highly alcoholic, very raw gin-like spirit distilled from\na special kind of plum.]\n\nThe little room obtained its daylight mainly from the street-door when\nit was open, for the one tiny window--on the right as you entered--was\nnot constructed to open, and its dulled glass masked more of daylight\nthan it allowed to filtrate through.\n\nOpposite the window a narrow door led into a couple of living rooms, the\nfirst of which also had direct access to the street.\n\nThe tap-room itself was always crowded and always busy, the benches\nround the walls were always occupied, and Klara and her father were\nnever allowed to remain idle for long. She dispensed the wine and the\nsilvorium, and made herself agreeable to the guests. Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz saw to the\ntobacco and the cigars. Village women in Hungary never frequent the\npublic inn: when they do, it is because they have sunk to the lowest\ndepths of degradation: a woman in drink is practically an unknown sight\nin the land.\n\nKlara herself, though her ways with the men were as free and easy as\nthose of her type and class usually are, would never have dreamed of\ndrinking with any of them.\n\nThis evening she was unusually busy. While the wedding feast was going\non lower down in the village, a certain number of men who liked stronger\nfare than what is usually provided at a \"maiden's farewell\" dance, as\nwell as those who had had no claim to be invited, strolled into the\ntap-room for a draught of silvorium, a gossip with the Jewess, or a game\nof tarok if any were going.\n\nIgn\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein himself was fond of a game. Like most of his race, his\nhabits were strictly sober. As he kept a cool head, he usually won; and\nhis winnings at tarok made a substantial addition to the income which he\nmade by selling spirits and tobacco. Leopold Hirsch, who kept the\nvillage grocery store, was also an inveterate player, and, like\nGoldstein, a very steady winner. But it was not the chance of a\nsuccessful gamble which brought him so often to the tap-room. For years\nnow he had dangled round Klara's fashionable skirts, and it seemed as if\nat last his constancy was to be rewarded. While she was younger--and was\nstill of surpassing beauty--she had had wilder flights of ambition than\nthose which would lead her to rule over a village grocery store: during\nthose times she had allowed Leopold Hirsch to court her, without giving\nhim more than very cursory encouragement.\n\nAs the years went on, however, and her various admirers from Arad proved\nundesirous to go to the length of matrimony, she felt more kindly\ndisposed toward Leo, who periodically offered her his heart and hand,\nand the joint ownership of the village grocery store. She had looked\ninto her little piece of mirror rather more closely of late than she had\ndone hitherto, and had discovered two or three ominous lines round her\nfine, almond-shaped eyes, and noted that her nose showed of late a more\nmarked tendency to make close acquaintance with her chin.\n\nThen she began to ponder, and to give the future more serious\nconsideration than she had ever done before. She ticked off on her long,\npointed fingers the last bevy of her admirers on whom she might\nreasonably count: the son of the chemist over in Arad, the tenant of the\nKender Road farm, the proprietor of the station cabs, and there were two\nor three others; but they were certainly falling away, and she had added\nno new ones to her list these past six months.\n\nEr\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la's formally declared engagement to Kapus Elsa had been a very\nsevere blow. She had really reckoned on B\u00c3\u00a9la. He was educated and\nunconventional, and though he professed the usual anti-Semitic views\npeculiar to his kind, Klara did not believe that these were very\ngenuine. At any rate, she had reckoned that her fine eyes and\nprovocative ways would tilt successfully against the man's racial\nprejudices.\n\nEr\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la was rich and certainly, up to a point, in love with her. Klara\nwas congratulating herself on the way she was playing her matrimonial\ncards, when all her hopes were so suddenly dashed to the ground.\n\nB\u00c3\u00a9la was going to marry that silly, ignorant peasant girl, and she,\nKlara, would be left to marry Leopold after all.\n\nHer anger and humiliation had been very great, and she had battled very\npersistently and very ably to regain the prize which she had lost. She\nknew quite well that, but for the fact that she belonged to the alien\nand despised race, Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la would have been only too happy to marry\nher. His vanity alone had made him choose Kapus Elsa. He wanted the\nnoted beauty for himself, because the noted beauty had been courted by\nso many people, and where so many people had failed he was proud to\nsucceed.\n\nNor would he have cared to have it said that he had married a Jewess.\nThere is always a certain thought of disgrace attached to such a\nmarriage, whether it has been contracted by peer or peasant, and Er\u00c3\u00b6s\nB\u00c3\u00a9la's one dominating idea in life was to keep the respect and deference\nof his native village.\n\nBut he had continued his attentions to Klara, and Klara had kept a\nwonderful hold over his imagination and over his will. She was the one\nwoman who had ever had her will with him--only partially, of course, and\nnot to the extent of forcing him into matrimony--but sufficiently to\nkeep him also dangling round her skirts even though his whole allegiance\nshould have belonged to Elsa.\n\nThe banquet this afternoon had been a veritable triumph. Whatever she\nhad suffered through B\u00c3\u00a9la's final disloyalty to herself, she knew that\nKapus Elsa must have suffered all through the banquet. The humiliation\nof seeing one's bridegroom openly flaunting his admiration for another\nwoman must have been indeed very bitter to bear.\n\nNot for a moment did Klara Goldstein doubt that the subsequent scene was\nan act of vengeance against herself on Elsa's part. She judged other\nwomen by her own standard, discounted other women's emotions, thoughts,\nfeelings, by her own. She thought it quite natural that Elsa should wish\nto be revenged, just as she was quite sure that B\u00c3\u00a9la was already\nmeditating some kind of retaliation for the shame which Andor had put\nupon him and for Elsa's obstinacy and share in the matter.\n\nShe had not spoken to anyone of the little scene which had occurred\nbetween the four walls of the little schoolroom: on the contrary she had\nspoken loudly of both the bridegroom's and the bride's cordiality to her\nduring the banquet.\n\n\"Elsa wanted me to go to the dancing this evening,\" she said casually,\n\"but I thought you would all miss me. I didn't want this place to be\ndull just because half the village is enjoying itself somewhere else.\"\n\nIt had been market day at Arad, and at about five o'clock Klara and her\nfather became very busy. Cattle-dealers and pig-merchants, travellers\nand pedlars, dropped in for a glass of silvorium and a chat with the\ngood-looking Jewess. More than one bargain, discussed on the marketplace\nof Arad, was concluded in the stuffy tap-room of Marosfalva.\n\n\"Shall we be honoured by the young Count's presence later on?\" someone\nasked, with a significant nod to Klara.\n\nEveryone laughed in sympathy; the admiration of the noble young Count\nfor Klara Goldstein was well-known. There was nothing in it, of course;\neven Klara, vain and ambitious as she was, knew that the bridge which\ndivided the aristocrat from one of her kind and of her race was an\nimpassable one. But she liked the young Count's attentions--she liked\nthe presents he brought her from time to time, and relished the\nnotoriety which this flirtation gave her.\n\nShe also loved to tease poor Leopold Hirsch. Leo had been passionately\nin love with her for years; what he must have endured in moral and\nmental torture during that time through his jealousy and often\ngroundless suspicions no one who did not know him intimately could ever\nhave guessed. These tortures which Klara wantonly inflicted upon the\nwretched young man had been a constant source of amusement to her. Even\nnow she was delighted because, as luck would have it, he entered the\ntap-room at the very moment when everyone was chaffing her about the\nyoung Count.\n\nLeopold Hirsch cast a quick, suspicious glance upon the girl, and his\ndull olive skin assumed an almost greenish hue. He was not of\nprepossessing appearance; this he knew himself, and the knowledge helped\nto keep his jealousy and his suspicion aflame.\n\nHe was short and lean of stature and his head, with its large, bony\nfeatures, seemed too big for his narrow shoulders to carry. His\nginger-coloured hair was lank and scanty; he wore it--after the manner\nof those of his race in that part of the world--in corkscrew ringlets\ndown each side of his narrow, cadaverous-looking face.\n\nHis eyes were pale and shifty, but every now and then there shot into\nthem a curious gleam of unbridled passion--love, hate or revenge; and\nthen the whole face would light up and compel attention by the\nrevelation of latent power.\n\nThis had happened now when a fellow who sat in the corner by the window\nmade some rough jest about the young Count. Leopold made his way to\nKlara's side; his thin lips were tightly pressed together, and he had\nburied his hands in the pockets of his ill-fitting trousers.\n\n\"If that accursed aristocrat comes hanging round here much more,\nKlara,\" he muttered between set teeth, \"I'll kill him one of these\ndays.\"\n\n\"What a fool you are, Leopold!\" she said. \"Why, yesterday it was Er\u00c3\u00b6s\nB\u00c3\u00a9la you objected to.\"\n\n\"And I do still,\" he retorted. \"I heard of your conduct at the banquet\nto-day. It is the talk of the village. One by one these loutish peasants\nhave come into my shop and told me the tale--curse them!--of how the\nbridegroom had eyes and ears only for you. You seem to forget, Klara,\"\nhe added, while a thought of menace crept into his voice, \"that you are\ntokened to me now. So don't try and make a fool of me, or .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"The Lord bless you, my good man,\" she retorted, with a laugh, \"I won't\ntry, I promise you. I wouldn't like to compete with the Almighty, who\nhas done that for you already.\"\n\n\"Klara .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Oh! be quiet now, Leo,\" she said impatiently. \"Can't you see that my\nhands are as full as I can manage, without my having to bother about you\nand your jealous tempers?\"\n\nShe elbowed him aside and went to the counter to serve a customer who\nhad just arrived, and more than a quarter of an hour went by before\nLeopold had the chance of another word with her.\n\n\"You might have a kind word for me to-night, Klara,\" he said ruefully,\nas soon as a brief lull in business enabled him to approach the girl.\n\n\"Why specially to-night?\" she asked indifferently.\n\n\"Your father must go by the night train to Kecskem\u00c3\u00a9t,\" he said, with\nseeming irrelevance. \"There is that business about the plums.\"\n\n\"The plums?\" she asked, with a frown of puzzlement, \"what plums?\"\n\n\"The fruit he bought near Kecskem\u00c3\u00a9t. They start gathering at sunrise\nto-morrow. He must be there the first hour, else he'd get shamefully\nrobbed. He must travel by night.\"\n\n\"I knew nothing about it,\" rejoined Klara, with an indifferent shrug of\nthe shoulders. \"Father never tells me when he is going to be away from\nhome.\"\n\n\"No!\" retorted Leopold, with a sneer, \"he knows better than to give all\nyour gallants such a brilliant opportunity.\"\n\n\"Don't be a fool, Leo!\" she reiterated with a laugh.\n\n\"I don't give any of them an opportunity, either,\" resumed the young\nman, while a curious look of almost animal ferocity crept into his pale\nface. \"Whenever your father has to be away from home during the night, I\ntake up my position outside this house and watch over you until daylight\ncomes and people begin to come and go.\"\n\n\"Very thoughtful of you, my good Leo,\" she rejoined dryly, \"but you need\nnot give yourself the trouble. I am well able to look after myself.\"\n\n\"If any man molested you,\" continued Leopold, speaking very calmly, \"I\nwould kill him.\"\n\n\"Who should molest me, you silly fool? And anyhow, I won't have you\nspying upon me like that.\"\n\n\"You must not call it spying, Klara. I love to stand outside this house\nin the peace and darkness of the night, and to think of you quietly\nsleeping whilst I am keeping watch over you. You wouldn't call a\nwatchdog a spy, would you?\"\n\n\"I know that to-night I shan't sleep a wink,\" she retorted crossly,\n\"once father has gone. I shall always be thinking of you out there in\nthe dark, watching this house. It will make me nervous.\"\n\n\"To-night .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" he began, and then abruptly checked himself. Once more\nthat quick flash of passion shot through his pale, deep-set eyes. It\nseemed as if he meant to tell her something, which on second thoughts he\ndecided to keep to himself. Her keen, dark eyes searched his face for a\nmoment or two; she wondered what it was that lurked behind that high,\nsmooth forehead of his and within the depths of that curiously perverted\nbrain.\n\nBefore she had time, however, to question him, Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la made noisy\nirruption into the room.\n\nHe was greeted with a storm of cheers.\n\n\"Hello, B\u00c3\u00a9la!\"\n\n\"Not the bridegroom, surely?\"\n\n\"Who would have thought of seeing you here?\"\n\nWhile Leopold Hirsch muttered audibly:\n\n\"What devil's mischief has brought this fellow here to-day, I wonder?\"\n\nB\u00c3\u00a9la seemed in boisterous good-humour--with somewhat ostentatious\nhilarity he greeted all his friends, and then ordered some of Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz\nGoldstein's best wine for everybody all round.\n\n\"Bravo, B\u00c3\u00a9la!\" came from every side, together with loud applause at this\nunexpected liberality.\n\n\"It is nice of you not to forget old friends,\" Klara whispered in his\near, as soon as he succeeded in reaching her side.\n\n\"Whew!\" he ejaculated with a sneer, \"you have no idea, my good Klara,\nhow I've been boring myself these past two hours. Those loutish peasants\nhave no idea of enjoyment save their eternal gipsy music and their\ninterminable cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s.\"\n\n\"For a man of your education, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" said Klara, with an insinuating\nsmile, \"it must be odiously dull. You would far rather have had a game\nof cards, wouldn't you now?\"\n\n\"I would far rather have had you at that infernal dance, so as to have\nhad somebody to talk to,\" he retorted savagely.\n\n\"Oh!\" she said demurely, \"that would never have done. Elsa must have\nsuch a lot to say to you herself. It would not be seemly for me to stand\nin the way.\"\n\n\"Elsa, as you know, has that silly cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s on the brain. She has been\ndancing ever since six o'clock and has only given me about ten minutes\nof her company. She seems to belong to-night to every young fool that\ncan dance, rather than to me.\"\n\n\"Ah well! When you are married you can stop all that, my good B\u00c3\u00a9la. You\ncan forbid your wife to dance the cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s, you know. I know many men who\ndo it. Then Elsa will learn to appreciate the pleasure of your\nconversation. Though she is no longer very young, she is still very\nignorant. You will have to educate her .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. bring her up to your own\nlevel of intelligence and of learning. In the meanwhile, do sit down and\ndrink with those who, like yourself, have come here for an hour or two\nto break the monotony of perpetual czig\u00c3\u00a1ny music and dancing.\"\n\nShe busied herself with drawing the corks of a number of bottles, which\nshe then transferred from the end of the room where she stood to the\ntables at which sat her customers; she also brought out some fresh\nglasses. B\u00c3\u00a9la watched her for a moment or two in silence, unconscious of\nthe fact that he, too, was being watched by a pair of pale eyes in which\nlurked a gleam of jealousy and of hate. Suddenly, as Klara brushed past\nhim carrying bottles and glasses, he took hold of her by the elbow and\ndrew her close to him.\n\n\"These louts won't stay late to-night, will they?\" he whispered in her\near.\n\n\"No, not late,\" she replied; \"they will go on to the barn in time for\nthe supper, you may be sure of that. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I will have the supper served at ten o'clock,\" he continued to whisper,\n\"but I'll not sit down to it. Not without you.\"\n\n\"Don't be foolish, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" she retorted. But even as he spoke, a little\ngleam of satisfaction, of gratified vanity, of anticipatory revenge,\nshot through her velvety dark eyes.\n\n\"I warned Elsa,\" he continued sullenly; \"I told her that if you were not\nat the feast, I should not be there either. She has disobeyed me. I must\npunish her.\"\n\n\"So?\" she rejoined, with an acid smile. \"It is only in order to punish\nElsa that you want to sup with me?\"\n\n\"Don't be stupid, Klara,\" he retorted. \"I'll come at ten o'clock. Will\nyou have some supper ready for me then? I have two or three bottles of\nFrench champagne over at my house--I'll bring them along. Will you be\nready for me?\"\n\n\"Be silent, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" she broke in hurriedly. \"Can't you see that that fool\nLeo is watching us all the time?\"\n\n\"Curse, him! What have I got to do with him?\" muttered B\u00c3\u00a9la savagely.\n\"You will be ready for me, Klara?\"\n\n\"No!\" she said decisively. \"Better make your peace with Elsa. I'll have\nnone of her leavings. I've had all I wanted out of you to-day--the\nbanquet first and now your coming here. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. It'll be all over the\nvillage presently--and that's all I care about. Have a drink now,\" she\nadded good-humouredly, \"and then go and make your peace with Elsa .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nif you can.\"\n\nShe turned abruptly away from him, leaving him to murmur curses under\nhis breath, and went on attending to her customers; nor did he get for\nthe moment another opportunity of speaking with her, for Leopold Hirsch\nhovered round her for some considerable time after that, and presently,\nwith much noise and pomp and circumstance, no less a personage than the\nnoble young Count himself graced the premises of Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein the\nJew with his august presence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\"Now go and fetch the key.\"\n\n\nHe belonged to the ancient family of R\u00c3\u00a1kosy, who had owned property on\nboth banks of the Maros for the past eight centuries, and Feri R\u00c3\u00a1kosy,\nthe twentieth-century representative of his medi\u00c3\u00a6val forbears, was a\ngood-looking young fellow of the type so often met with among the upper\nclasses in Hungary: quite something English in appearance--well set-up,\nwell-dressed, well-groomed from the top of his smooth brown hair to the\ntips of his immaculately-shod feet--in the eyes an expression of\nhabitual boredom, further accentuated by the slight, affected stoop of\nthe shoulders and a few premature lines round the nose and mouth; and\nabout his whole personality that air of high-breeding and of good, pure\nblood which is one of the chief characteristics of the true Hungarian\naristocracy.\n\nHe did little more than acknowledge the respectful salutations which\ngreeted him from every corner of the little room as he entered, but he\nnodded to Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la and smiled all over his good-looking face at Klara,\nwho, in her turn, welcomed him with a profusion of smiles which brought\na volley of muttered curses to Leopold Hirsch's lips.\n\nWhile he held her one hand rather longer than was necessary she, with\nthe other, took his hat from him, and then, laughing coquettishly, she\npointed to a parcel which was causing the pocket of his well-cut Norfolk\njacket to bulge immoderately.\n\n\"Is that something for me?\" she asked.\n\n\"Of course it is,\" he replied lightly; \"I bought it at the fair in Arad\nfor you to-day.\"\n\n\"How thoughtful of you!\" she said, with a little sigh of pleasure.\n\n\"Thoughtful?\" he retorted, laughing pleasantly. \"My good Klara, if I\nhadn't thought of you I would have died of boredom this afternoon. Here,\ngive me a glass of your father's best wine and I'll tell you.\"\n\nHe sat down with easy familiarity on the corner of the table which\nserved as a counter. Klara, after this, had eyes and ears only for him.\nHow could it be otherwise, seeing that it was not often a noble lord\ngraced a village tap-room with his presence. Conversations round the\nroom were now carried on in whispers; tarok cards were produced and here\nand there a game was in progress. Those who had drunk overmuch made\nthemselves as inconspicuous as they could, drawing themselves closely\nagainst the wall, or frankly reclining across the table with arms\noutstretched and heads buried between them out of sight.\n\nAn atmosphere of subdued animation and decorum reigned in the place; not\na few men, oppressed by their sense of respect for my lord, had effected\na quiet exit through the door, preferring the jovial atmosphere of the\nbarn, from whence came, during certain hushed moments, the sounds of\nmusic and of laughter.\n\nThe young man--whose presence caused all this revulsion in the usually\nnoisy atmosphere of the tap-room--took no heed whatever of anything that\nwent on around him: he seemed unconscious alike of the deference of the\npeasants as of the dark, menacing scowl with which Leopold Hirsch\nregarded him. He certainly did not bestow a single glance on Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la\nwho, at my lord's appearance, had retreated into the very darkest\ncorner of the room. B\u00c3\u00a9la did not care to encounter the young Count's\nsneering remarks just now--and these would of a certainty have been\nlevelled against the bridegroom who was sitting in a tap-room when he\nshould have been in attendance on his bride. But indeed my lord never\nsaw him.\n\nTo this young scion of a noble race, which had owned land and serfs for\ncenturies past, these peasants here were of no more account than his\noxen or his sheep--nor was the owner of a village shop of any more\nconsequence in my lord's eyes.\n\nHe came here because there was a good-looking Jewess in the tap-room\nwhose conversation amused him, and whose dark, velvety eyes, fringed\nwith long lashes, and mouth with full, red lips, stirred his jaded\nsenses in a more pleasant and more decided way than did the eyes and\nlips of the demure, well-bred young Countesses and Baronesses who formed\nhis usual social circle.\n\nWhether his flirtation with Klara, the Jewess, annoyed the girl's Jew\nlover or not, did not matter to him one jot; on the contrary the\njealousy of that dirty lout Hirsch enhanced his amusement to a\nconsiderable extent.\n\nTherefore he did not take the trouble to lower his voice now when he\ntalked to Klara, and it was quite openly that he put his arm round her\nwaist while he held his glass to her lips--\"To sweeten your father's\nvinegar!\" he said with a laugh.\n\n\"You know, my pretty Klara,\" he said gaily, \"that I was half afraid I\nshouldn't see you to-day at all.\"\n\n\"No?\" she asked coquettishly.\n\n\"No, by gad! My father was so soft-hearted to allow Er\u00c3\u00b6s a day off for\nhis wedding or something, and so, if you please, I had to go to Arad\nwith him, as he had to see about a sale of clover. I thought we should\nnever get back. The roads were abominable.\"\n\n\"I hardly expected your lordship,\" she said demurely.\n\nTo punish her for that little lie, he tweaked her small ear till it\nbecame a bright crimson.\n\n\"That is to punish you for telling such a lie,\" he said gaily. \"You know\nthat I meant to come and say good-bye.\"\n\n\"Your lordship goes to-morrow?\" she asked with a sigh.\n\n\"To shoot bears, my pretty Klara,\" he replied. \"I don't want to go. I\nwould rather stay another week here for you to amuse me, you know.\"\n\n\"I am proud .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" she whispered.\n\n\"So much do you amuse me that I have brought you a present, just to show\nyou that I thought of you to-day and because I want you not to forget me\nduring the three months that I shall be gone.\"\n\nHe drew the parcel out of his pocket and, turning his back to the rest\nof the room, he cut the string and undid the paper that wrapped it. The\ncontents of the parcel proved to be a morocco case, which flew open at a\ntouch and displayed a gold curb chain bracelet--the dream of Klara\nGoldstein's desires.\n\n\"For me?\" she said, with a gasp of delight.\n\n\"For your pretty arm, yes,\" he replied. \"Shall I put it on?\"\n\nShe cast a swift, apprehensive glance round the room over his shoulder.\n\n\"No, no, not now,\" she said quickly.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Father mightn't like it. I'd have to ask him.\"\n\n\"D----n your father!\"\n\n\"And that fool, Leopold, is so insanely jealous.\"\n\n\"D----n him too,\" said the young man quietly.\n\nWhereupon he took the morocco case out of Klara's hand, shut it with a\nsnap and put it back into his pocket.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" cried Klara in a fright.\n\n\"As you see, pretty one, I am putting the bracelet away for future use.\"\n\n\"But .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" she stammered.\n\n\"If I can't put the bracelet on your arm myself,\" he said decisively,\n\"you shan't have it at all.\"\n\n\"But .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"That is my last word. Let us talk of something else.\"\n\n\"No, no! We won't talk of something else. You said the bracelet was for\nme.\"\n\nShe cast a languishing look on him through her long upper lashes; she\nbared her wrist and held it out to him. Leopold and his jealousy might\ngo hang for aught she cared, for she meant to have the bracelet.\n\nThe young man, with a fatuous little laugh, brought out the case once\nmore. With his own hands he now fastened the bracelet round Klara\nGoldstein's wrist. Then--as a matter of course--he kissed her round,\nbrown arm just above the bracelet, and also the red lips through which\nthe words of thanks came quickly tumbling.\n\nKlara did not dare to look across the room. She felt, though she did not\nsee, Leopold's pale eyes watching this little scene with a glow in them\nof ferocious hate and of almost animal rage.\n\n\"I won't stay now, Klara,\" said the young Count, dropping his voice\nsuddenly to a whisper; \"too many of these louts about. When will you be\nfree?\"\n\n\"Oh, not to-day,\" she whispered in reply. \"After the fair there are sure\nto be late-comers. And you know Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la has a ball on at the barn and\nsupper afterwards. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"The very thing,\" he broke in, in an eager whisper. \"While they are all\nat supper, I'll come in for a drink and a chat. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Ten o'clock, eh?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no!\" she protested feebly. \"My father wouldn't like it, he\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"D----n your father, my dear, as I remarked before. And, as a matter of\nfact, your father is not going to be in the way at all. He goes to\nKecskem\u00c3\u00a9t by the night train.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"My father told me quite casually that Goldstein was seeing to some\nbusiness for him at Kecskem\u00c3\u00a9t to-morrow. So it was not very difficult to\nguess that if your father was to be in Kecskem\u00c3\u00a9t to-morrow in time to\ntransact business, he would have to travel up by the nine o'clock train\nthis evening in order to get there.\"\n\nThen, as she made no reply, and a blush of pleasure gradually suffused\nher dark skin, lending it additional charm and giving to her eyes added\nbrilliancy, he continued, more peremptorily this time:\n\n\"At ten o'clock, then--I'll come back. Get rid of as many of these louts\nby then as you can.\"\n\nShe was only too ready to yield. Not only was she hugely flattered by my\nlord's attentions, but she found him excessively attractive. He could\nmake himself very agreeable to a woman if he chose, and evidently he\nchose to do so now. Moreover Klara had found by previous experience that\nto yield to the young man's varied and varying caprices was always\nremunerative, and there was that gold watch which he had once vaguely\npromised her, and which she knew she could get out of him if she had the\ntime and opportunity, as she certainly would have to-night if he came.\n\nCount Feri, seeing that she had all but yielded, was preparing to go.\nHer hand was still in his, and he was pressing her slender fingers in\ntoken of a pledge for this evening.\n\n\"At ten o'clock,\" he whispered again.\n\n\"No, no,\" she protested once more, but this time he must have known that\nshe only did it for form's sake and really meant to let him have his\nway. \"The neighbours would see you enter, and there might be a whole lot\nof people in the tap-room at that hour: one never knows. They would know\nby then that my father had gone away and they would talk such scandal\nabout me. My reputation .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nNo doubt he felt inclined to ejaculate in his usual manner: \"D----n your\nreputation!\" but he thought better of it, and merely said casually:\n\n\"I need not come in by the front door, need I?\"\n\n\"The back door is always locked,\" she remarked ingenuously. \"My father\ninvariably locks it himself the last thing at night.\"\n\n\"But since he is going to Kecskem\u00c3\u00a9t .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" he suggested.\n\n\"When he has to be away from home for the night he locks the door from\nthe inside and takes the key away with him.\"\n\n\"Surely there is a duplicate key somewhere? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she murmured.\n\n\"If you don't know, who should?\" he remarked, with affected\nindifference. \"Well! I shall have to make myself heard at the back\ndoor--that's all!\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you hear me if I knocked?\"\n\n\"Not if I were in the tap-room and a lot of customers to attend to.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I should hammer away until you did hear me.\"\n\n\"For that old gossip R\u00c3\u00a9zi to hear you,\" she protested. \"Her cottage is\nnot fifty paces away from our back door.\"\n\n\"Then it will have to be the front door, after all,\" he rejoined\nphilosophically.\n\n\"No, no!--the neighbours--and perhaps the tap-room full of people.\"\n\n\"But d----n it, Klara,\" he exclaimed impatiently, \"I have made up my\nmind to come and spend my last evening with you--and when I have made up\nmy mind to a thing, I am not likely to change it because of a lot of\ngossiping peasants, because of old R\u00c3\u00a9zi, or the whole lot of them. So if\nyou don't want me to come in by the front door, which is open, or to\nknock at the back door, which is locked, how am I going to get in?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you'll have to find out, my pretty one,\" he said\ndecisively, \"for it has got to be done somehow, or that gold watch we\nspoke of the other day will have to go to somebody else. And you know\nwhen I say a thing I mean it. Eh?\"\n\n\"There is a duplicate key,\" she whispered shyly, \".\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. to the back\ndoor, I mean.\"\n\n\"I thought there was,\" he remarked dryly. \"Where is it?\"\n\n\"In the next room. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. It hangs on a nail by father's bedside.\"\n\n\"Go and get it, then,\" he said more impatiently.\n\n\"Not now,\" she urged. \"Leopold is looking straight at you and me.\"\n\nHe shrugged his aristocratic shoulders.\n\n\"You are not afraid of that monkey?\" he said with a laugh.\n\n\"Well, no! not exactly afraid. But he is so insanely jealous; one never\nknows what kind of mischief he'll get into. He told me just now that\nwhenever father is away from home he takes his stand outside this house\nfrom nightfall till morning--watching!\"\n\n\"A modern Argus--eh?\"\n\n\"A modern lunatic!\" she retorted.\n\n\"Well!\" resumed the young man lightly, \"lunatic or not, he won't be able\nto keep an eye on you to-night, even though your father will be away.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"Hirsch is off to Fiume in half an hour.\"\n\n\"To Fiume?\"\n\n\"Yes. You know he has a brother coming home from America.\"\n\n\"I know that.\"\n\n\"His ship is due in at Fiume the day after to-morrow. Leopold must start\nby the same train as your father to-night, in order to catch the express\nfor Fiume at Budapesth to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Did he tell you all that?\"\n\n\"I have known all along that he meant to meet his brother at Fiume, and\nyesterday he said something about it again. So you see, my pretty one,\nthat we can have a comfortable little supper this evening without fear\nof interruption. We'll have it at ten o'clock, when the supper-party is\ngoing on at the barn, eh? We shan't be interrupted then. So give me that\nduplicate key, will you, and I can slip in quietly through the back door\nwithout raising a bit of gossip or scandal. Hurry up now! I shall have\nto be going.\"\n\n\"I can't now,\" she protested. \"Leopold hasn't taken his eyes off me all\nthis time.\"\n\n\"Oh! if that is all that is troubling you, my dear,\" said the young man\ncoolly, \"I can easily settle our friend Leopold. Hirsch!\" he called\nloudly.\n\n\"My lord?\" queried the other, with the quick obsequiousness habitual to\nthe down-trodden race.\n\n\"My horse is kicking up such a row outside. I wish you'd just go and see\nif the boy is looking after him properly.\"\n\nOf course it was impossible to do anything but obey. My lord had\ncommanded; in the ordinary way the poor Jew shopkeeper would have felt\nhonoured to have been selected for individual recognition. Nor did he do\nmore now than throw one of those swift looks of his--so full of hatred\nand of menace--upon Klara and the young man; but the latter, having\ngiven his orders, no longer condescended to take notice of the Jew and\nhad once more engaged the girl in animated conversation.\n\nHad Klara thought of looking up when Leopold finally obeyed my lord's\ncommands and went to look after the horse, she could not have failed to\nrealize the danger which lurked in the young man's pale eyes then. His\nface, always pale and olive-tinted, was now the colour of ashes, grey\nand livid and blotched with purple, his lips looked white and quivering,\nand his eyebrows--of a reddish tinge--met above his nose in a deep, dark\nscowl.\n\nBut my lord had thrown out a casual hint about a gold watch, and Klara\nhad no further thought for her jealous admirer.\n\n\"Now go and fetch the key,\" said Count Feri, as soon as the door had\nclosed on Leopold.\n\nThe hint of the gold watch had stirred Klara's pulses. A _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_\nwith my lord was, moreover, greatly to her liking. He could be very\namusing when he chose, and was always generous; and Klara's life was\noften dull and colourless. A pleasant evening spent in his company would\ncompensate her in a measure for her disappointment at not being asked to\nElsa's ball, and there was the gold watch to look forward to, above all.\n\nTaking an opportunity when her father was absorbed in his game of tarok,\nshe went into the next room and presently returned with a key in her\nhand, which she surreptitiously gave to my lord.\n\n\"Splendid!\" exclaimed the young man gaily. \"Klara, you are a gem, and\nafter supper you shall just ask me for anything you have a fancy for,\nand I'll give it to you. Now I'd better go. Good-bye, little one. Ten\no'clock sharp, eh?\"\n\n\"Ten o'clock,\" she repeated, under her breath.\n\nHe strode to the door, outside which he found Leopold waiting for him.\n\n\"The horse was quite quiet, my lord,\" said the Jew sullenly; \"the boy\nhad never left it for a moment.\"\n\n\"Oh! that's all right, Hirsch,\" rejoined my lord indifferently. \"I only\nwanted to know.\"\n\nOf course he never thought of saying a word of thanks or of excuse to\nthe other man. What would you? A Jew! Bah! not even worth a nod of the\nhead.\n\nCount Feri R\u00c3\u00a1kosy had quickly mounted his pretty, half-bred Arab mare--a\nclick of the tongue and she was off with him, kicking up a cloud of dust\nin her wake.\n\nBut Leopold Hirsch had remained for a moment standing on the doorstep of\nIgn\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein's house. He watched horse and rider through that cloud\nof dust, and along the straight and broad highway, until both had\nbecome a mere speck upon the low-lying horizon.\n\n\"May you break your accursed neck!\" he muttered fervently.\n\nThen he went back to the tap-room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\"You happen to be of my race and of my blood.\"\n\n\nHe strode at once to Klara, who greeted him with an ironical little\nsmile and a coquettish look out of her dark eyes.\n\n\"You never told me that you were going away to-night, my dear Leopold,\"\nshe said suavely.\n\n\"Who told you that I was?\" he retorted savagely.\n\n\"It seems to be pretty well known about the place. You seemed to have\nbeen talking about it pretty freely that you were going to Fiume to meet\nyour brother when the ship he is on comes in.\"\n\n\"I meant to tell you just now, only his lordship's arrival interrupted\nme,\" he said more quietly.\n\n\"And since then you have been busy making a fool of yourself before my\nlord, eh?\" she asked.\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"And compromising me into the bargain, what? But let me tell you this,\nmy good Leopold, before we go any further, that I am not married to you\nyet, and that I don't like your airs of proprietorship, _sabe_?\"\n\nHe could not say anything more just then, for customers were departing,\nand she had to attend to them; he did not try to approach her while she\nwas thus engaged, but presently, when her back was turned, he contrived\nto work his way across to the door which gave on the inner room, and to\npush it slightly open with his hand, until he could peep through the\naperture and take a quick survey of the room beyond.\n\nKlara had not seen this manoeuvre of his, although she had cast more\nthan one rapid and furtive glance upon him while she attended to her\ncustomers. She was thankful that he was going away for a few days; in\nhis present mood he was positively dangerous.\n\nShe had lighted the oil lamp which hung from the centre of the low,\nraftered ceiling, the hour was getting late, customers were all leaving\nnow one by one.\n\nEr\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la was one of the last to go.\n\nHe had drunk rather more silvorium than was good for him. He knew quite\nwell that by absenting himself from the pre-nuptial festivals he had\nbehaved in a disgraceful and unjustifiable manner which would surely be\nresented throughout the village, and though he was quite sure that he\ndid not care one brass fill\u00c3\u00a9r what all those ignorant peasants thought\nof him, yet he felt it incumbent upon him to brace up his courage now,\nbefore meeting the hostile fusillade of eyes which would be sure to\ngreet him on his return to the barn.\n\nHe meant to put in a short appearance there, and then to finish his\nevening here in Klara's company. He felt that his dignity demanded that\nhe should absent himself at any rate from the supper, seeing that Elsa\nhad so grossly defied him.\n\n\"At ten o'clock I'll be back, Klara,\" he whispered, in the girl's ear,\nas he was about to take his departure along with some of his friends,\nwho also intended to go on to the dance in the barn.\n\n\"Indeed you won't,\" she retorted decisively, \"I have no use for you, my\ngood B\u00c3\u00a9la. You are almost a married man now, remember!\" she added with a\nlaugh.\n\n\"I'll bring those bottles of champagne,\" he urged; \"don't be hard on me,\nKlara. I'll give you a good time to-night, and a nice present into the\nbargain.\"\n\n\"And ruin my reputation for ever, eh? By walking into the tap-room when\nit's full of people and carrying two bottles of champagne under your\narm--or staying on ostentatiously after everyone has gone and for\neveryone to gossip. No, thank you; I've already told you that I am not\ngoing to lend myself to your little games of vengeance. It isn't me you\nwant, it's petty revenge upon Elsa. To that I say no, thank you, my good\nman.\"\n\n\"Klara!\" he pleaded.\n\n\"No!\" she said, and unceremoniously turned her back on him.\n\nHe went off, sullen and morose, and not a little chaffed for his\nmoroseness by his friends.\n\nThe tap-room was almost deserted for the moment. In one or two corners\nonly a few stragglers lingered; they were sprawling across the tables\nwith arms outstretched. Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein's silvorium had proved too\npotent and too plentiful. They lay there in a drunken sleep--logs that\nwere of no account. Presently they would have to be thrown out, but\nthere was no hurry for that--they were not in the way.\n\nIgn\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein had gone into the next room. Klara was busy tidying up\nthe place; Leopold approached her with well-feigned contrition and\nhumility.\n\n\"I am sorry, Klara,\" he said. \"I seemed to have had the knack to-night\nof constantly annoying you. So I'd best begone now, perhaps.\"\n\n\"I bear no malice, Leo,\" she said quietly.\n\n\"I thought I'd come back at about nine o'clock,\" he continued. \"It is\nnearly eight now.\"\n\nShe, thinking that he had his own journey in mind, remarked casually:\n\n\"You'd best be here well before nine. The train leaves at nine-twenty,\nand father walks very slowly.\"\n\n\"I won't be late,\" he said. \"Best give me the key of the back door. I'll\nlet myself in that way.\"\n\n\"No occasion to do that,\" she retorted. \"The front door will be open.\nYou can come in that way like everybody else.\"\n\n\"It's just a fancy,\" he said quietly; \"there might be a lot of people\nabout just then. I don't want to come through here. I thought I'd just\nslip in the back way as I often do. So give me the key, Klara, will\nyou?\"\n\n\"How can I give you the key of the back door?\" she said, equally\nquietly; \"you know father always carries it in his coat pocket.\"\n\n\"But there is a second key,\" he remarked, \"which hangs on a nail by your\nfather's bedside in the next room. Give me that one, Klara.\"\n\n\"I shan't,\" she retorted. \"I never heard such nonsense! As if I could\nallow you to use the private door of this house just as it suits your\nfancy. If you want to come in to-night and say good-bye, you must come\nin by the front door.\"\n\n\"It's just a whim of mine, Klara,\" urged Leopold, now still speaking\nquietly--almost under his breath--but there was an ominous tremor in his\nvoice and sudden sharp gleams in his eyes which the girl had already\nnoted and which caused the blood to rush back to her heart, leaving her\ncheeks pale and her lips trembling.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" she contrived to say, with an indifferent shrug of the\nshoulders.\n\n\"Just a whim,\" he reiterated. \"So I'll take the key, by your leave.\"\n\nHe turned to the door of the inner room and pushed it open, just as he\nhad done awhile ago, and now--as then--he cast a rapid glance round the\nroom.\n\nKlara, through half-closed lids, watched his every movement.\n\n\"Why!\" he exclaimed, turning back to her, and with a look of\nwell-feigned surprise, \"the key is not in its place.\"\n\n\"I know it isn't,\" she retorted curtly.\n\n\"Then where is it?\"\n\n\"I have put it away.\"\n\n\"When? It was hanging on its usual nail when I first came here this\nafternoon. I remember the door being open, and my glancing into the room\ncasually. I am sure it was there then.\"\n\n\"It may have been: but I put it away after that.\"\n\n\"Why should you have done that?\"\n\n\"I don't know, and, anyhow, it's no business of yours, is it?\"\n\n\"Give me that back-door key, Klara,\" insisted the young man, in a tone\nof savage command.\n\n\"No!\" she replied, slowly and decisively.\n\nThere was silence in the little, low raftered room after that, a silence\nonly broken by the buzzing of flies against the white globe of the lamp,\nand by the snores of the sleepers who sprawled across the tables.\n\nLeopold Hirsch had drawn in his breath with a low, hissing sound; his\nface, by the yellow light of the lamp, looked ghastly in colour, and his\nhands were twitching convulsively as the trembling fingers clenched and\nopened with a monotonous, jerky movement of attempted self-control.\n\nKlara had not failed to notice these symptoms of an agony of mind which\nthe young man was so vainly trying to hide from her. For the moment she\nalmost felt sorry for him--sorry and slightly remorseful.\n\nAfter all, Leo's frame of mind, the agony which he endured, came from\nthe strength of his love for her. Neither Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la, nor the young\nCount, nor the many admirers who had hung round her in the past until\nsuch time as their fancy found more permanent anchorage elsewhere, would\nhave suffered tortures of soul and of heart because she had indulged in\na mild flirtation with a rival. Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la would have stormed and cursed,\nthe young Count would have laid his riding-whip across the shoulders of\nhis successful rival and there would have been an end of the matter.\nLeopold Hirsch would go down to hell and endure the torments of the\ndamned, then return to heaven at a smile from her, and go back to hell\nagain and glory in his misery.\n\nBut just now she was frightened of him; he looked almost like a living\ncorpse; the skin on his face was drawn so tightly over the bones that it\ngave him the appearance of a skull with hollow eyes and wide, grinning\nmouth.\n\nOutside an owl hooted dismally. Klara gave a slight shiver of fear and\nlooked furtively round her to see if any of the drunkards were awake.\nThen she recollected that her father was in the next room, and\npresently, from afar, came shouts of laughter and the sound of music.\n\nShe woke as from a nightmare, gave her fine shoulders a little shake,\nand looked boldly into her jealous lover's face.\n\n\"By the Lord, Leo!\" she said, with a little forced laugh, \"you have\ngiven me the creeps, looking as you do. How dare you frighten me like\nthat? With your clenched hands, too, as if you wanted to murder me.\nThere, now, don't be such a silly fool. You have got a long journey\nbefore you; it's no use making yourself sick with jealousy just before\nyou go.\"\n\n\"I am not going on a journey,\" he said, in a toneless, even voice, which\nseemed to come from a grave.\n\n\"Not going?\" she said, with a frown of puzzlement. \"You were going to\nFiume to meet your brother, don't you remember? The ship he is on is due\nin the day after to-morrow. If you don't start to-night you won't be\nable to catch the express at Budapesth to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I know all that,\" he said, in the same dull, monotonous tone; \"I am not\ngoing, that's all.\"\n\n\"But .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"I have changed my mind. Your father is going away. I must watch over\nyou to see that no one molests you. Thieves might want to break in .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\none never knows .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. anyhow, my brother can look after himself .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I\nstay to look after you.\"\n\nFor a moment or two she stood quite still, her senses strained to grasp\nthe meaning, the purport of the present situation--this madman on the\nwatch outside--the young Count, key in hand, swaggering up to the back\ndoor at ten o'clock, when most folk would be at supper in the barn, her\nfather gone, the village street wrapped in darkness!\n\nLeopold, by a violent and sudden effort, had regained mastery over the\nmuscles of his face and hands, these no longer twitched now, and he\nanswered her look of mute inquiry with one of well-feigned quietude.\nOnly his breath he could not control, it passed through his throat with\na stertorous sound, and every now and then he had to pass his tongue\nover his dry, cracked lips.\n\nThus they stood for a moment eye to eye; and what she read in his\nglance caused a nameless fear to strike at her heart and to paralyse her\nwill. But the next instant she had recovered her presence of mind. With\nquick, febrile movements she had already taken off her apron and with\nher hands smoothed her unruly dark hair. Then she made for the door.\n\nLess than a second and already he had guessed her purpose: before she\ncould reach the door he had his back against it and his nervy fingers\nhad grasped her wrist.\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"Out,\" she said curtly.\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"That's none of your business.\"\n\n\"What for?\" he reiterated hoarsely.\n\n\"Let go my wrist,\" she exclaimed, \"you are hurting me.\"\n\n\"I'll hurt you worse,\" he cried, in a broken voice, \"if you cross this\nthreshold to-night.\"\n\nBut he released her wrist, and she, wrathful, indignant, terrified,\nretreated to the other end of the room.\n\n\"Go out by the back door,\" he sneered, \"if you want to go out. You have\nthe key, haven't you?\"\n\n\"My father .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" she began.\n\n\"Yes!\" he said. \"Go and tell your father that I, Leopold Hirsch, your\naffianced husband, am browbeating you--making a scene, what?--because\nyou have made an assignation with my lord the young Count, here--at\nnight--under your father's roof--under the roof of a child of Israel!\nYou! An assignation with a dirty Christian! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Bah! Go and tell your\nfather that! And he will thrash you to within an inch of your life! We\nare Jews, he and I, and hold the honour of our women sacred--more sacred\nthan their life!\"\n\n\"Don't be a fool, Leopold,\" she cried, feeling that indeed, between her\nfather and this madman, her life had ceased to be safe. She looked round\nher helplessly. Three or four besotted fools lying helpless across the\ntables, and all the village dancing and making merry some two hundred\nm\u00c3\u00a8tres away, her father--implacable, as she well knew, where her conduct\nwas concerned--and this madman ready to kill to satisfy his lust of\nvengeance and of hate--she felt that indeed, unless Heaven performed a\nmiracle, here was the beginning of an awful, an irredeemable tragedy.\n\n\"Leopold, don't be a fool,\" she reiterated, trying with all her might\nnot to appear frightened or scared or confused. \"I have promised Kapus\nElsa to go to her dance for half an hour. I had forgotten all about it.\nI must go now.\"\n\n\"Go and change your dress, then,\" he retorted with a sneer, \"then you\ncan go out by the back way. You have put the key away somewhere, haven't\nyou? You know where it is.\"\n\n\"You are mad about doors to-night. I tell you I am going out now, by\nthat front door--at once.\"\n\n\"And I tell you,\" he said, slowly and deliberately, \"that if you cross\nthe front door step I will call your father and tell him that you go and\nmeet your lover--a Christian lover--the young Count--who would as soon\nthink of marrying you as he would a nigger or a kitchen slut. Before you\nwill have reached the high road your father and I will be on your heels,\nand either he or I will strangle you ere you come within sight of my\nlord's castle.\"\n\n\"You are mad!\" she cried. \"Or else an idiot.\"\n\n\"Better look for that back-door key,\" he retorted.\n\n\"What has the back-door key to do with it?\" she asked sullenly.\n\n\"Only this,\" he replied, \"that while that monkey-faced dog of a\nChristian was whispering to you just now, I know that the key was\nhanging on its usual peg, but I heard something about 'supper' and about\n'ten o'clock.' May he break his neck, I say, and save me the job. Then\nhe ordered me out of the room. Oh! I guessed! I am no fool, you know!\nWhen I came back I looked into your father's room--the key was gone, and\nI knew. And what I say is, why can't he come in by the front door like a\nman, if he has nothing to hide? Why must you let him come in like a\nthief by a back-door, if you have nothing to be ashamed of? The tap-room\nis open to anybody. Anybody can walk in and get a drink if they want to.\nThen why this whispering and this sneaking?\"\n\nHe was working himself up to a greater and ever greater passion of fury.\nHe kept his voice low because he didn't want Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein to\nhear--not just yet, at any rate--for Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz was a hard man and a stern\nfather, and God only knew what he might not do if he was roused. Leopold\ndid not want Klara hurt--not yet, at any rate--not until he was quite\nsure that she meant to play him altogether false. She was vain and\nfrivolous, over-fond of dress and of queening it over the peasant girls\nof the village, but there was no real harm in her. She was immensely\nflattered by the young Count's attentions and over-ready to accept his\npresents in exchange for kisses and whisperings behind closed doors, but\nthere was no real harm in her--so at least Leopold Hirsch kept repeating\nto himself time and again, whenever jealousy gnawed at his heart more\nroughly than he could endure.\n\nJust now that torment was almost unbearable, and the passion of fury\ninto which he had worked himself blinded him momentarily to the dull,\naching pain. Klara, as he spoke thus hoarsely, and brought his contorted\nface closer and closer to hers, had gradually shrunk more and more into\nthe corner of the room, and there she remained now, flattened against\nthe wall, her wide-open, terror-filled eyes fixed staringly upon this\nraving madman.\n\n\"You asked just now,\" he continued, in the same hoarse, guttural\nwhisper, which seemed literally to be racking and tearing his throat as\nit came, \"what the back-door key had to do with my not going to meet my\nbrother at Fiume. Well! It has this much to do with it, that you happen\nto be my tokened wife, that you happen to be of my race and of my blood,\na sober, clean-living Jewess, please God, and not one of those\nfrivolous, empty-headed Christian girls--you are that now, I know; if\nyou were not I would kill you first and myself afterwards: therefore, if\nto-night I catch a thief--any thief, I don't care who he is--sneaking\ninto this house by a back door when you happen to be here alone and\nseemingly unprotected, if I catch any kind of thief or malefactor, I say\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHe paused, and she, through teeth that chattered, contrived to murmur:\n\n\"Well? What do you say? Why don't you go on?\"\n\n\"Because you understand,\" he said, with calm as sudden and as terrible\nas his rage had been awhile ago. \"I am not a Christian, you know, nor\nyet a gentleman. I cannot walk up either to my lord's castle or to one\nof these Christian Magyar peasants and strike him in the face for trying\nto rob me of that which is more precious to me than life. I am a Jew\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. a low-born, miserable Jew, whose whole race, origin and upbringing\nare despicable in the sight of the noble lords as well as of the\nHungarian peasantry. Just a wretched creature whom one orders to hold\none's horse, to brush one's boots, to stand out of one's way, anyhow;\nbut not to meet as man to man, not to fight openly and frankly for the\nwoman whom one loves. Well! You happen to be a Jewess too, and tokened\nto a Jew, and if either my lord or one of these d----d Magyar peasants\nchooses to come sneaking round you like a thief in the night, well\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHe paused, and from the pocket of his shabby trousers he half drew out a\nlong, sheathed hunting-knife, and then quickly hid it again from her\nsight.\n\nKlara smothered a desperate cry of terror. Leopold now turned his back\non her; he went up to the table and seizing a carafe of water, he poured\nhimself out a huge mugful and drank it down at a draught. The edge of\nthe mug rattled against his teeth, his hand was trembling so that half\nthe contents were poured down on his clothes. He did not look again on\nKlara, but having put the mug down, he passed his hand once or twice\nacross his forehead as if to chase away some of those horrible thoughts\nwhich were still lurking in his brain.\n\nThen he took his cigarette-case out of his pocket, selected a cigarette,\nstruck a match and lit it, still avoiding Klara's fixed and staring\ngaze.\n\n\"I'll go and smoke this outside,\" he said quietly. \"I can see both doors\nfrom the corner. When you have found that back-door key you may go to\nElsa Kapus' wedding feast, but not before.\"\n\nHe took a final look round the room, and his eyes, which had once more\nbecome dull and pale, rested with an infinite look of contempt upon the\ntwo or three besotted drunkards who, throughout this scene, had done no\nmore than open and blink a sleepy eye.\n\n\"Shall I turn these louts out for you now?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, no,\" she replied mechanically, \"let them have their sleep. When\nthey wake they'll go away all right.\"\n\nJust then the outer door was opened and Lakatos Andor's broad figure\nappeared upon the threshold. Leopold Hirsch gave him a nod, and without\nanother look on Klara, he strode out into the night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\"Jealous, like a madman.\"\n\n\n\"I came to see if B\u00c3\u00a9la was still here,\" said Andor, as soon as the door\nhad closed on Leopold Hirsch. \"One or two chaps whom I met awhile ago\ntold me that he had not been seen in the barn this hour past, and that\nthere was a lot of talk about it. I thought that if he were here, I\ncould persuade you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHe paused, and looked more keenly at the girl.\n\n\"What is it, Klara?\" he asked; \"you seem ill or upset .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nShe closed her eyes once or twice like someone just waking out of a\ndream, then she passed her hands over her forehead and over her hair.\nShe felt completely dazed and stupid, as if she had received a stunning\nblow on the head, and while Andor talked she looked at him with staring\neyes, not understanding a word that he said.\n\n\"Yes--yes, Andor?\" she said vaguely. \"What can I do for you?\"\n\n\"Nothing much, my good Klara,\" he replied; \"it was only about B\u00c3\u00a9la\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Yes--about B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" she stammered; \"won't .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. won't you sit down?\"\n\n\"Thank you, I will for a moment.\"\n\nShe moved forward in order to get him a chair, but she found that she\ncould not stand. The moment that she relinquished the prop of the wall,\nher knees gave way under her and she lurched forward against the table.\nShe would have fallen had not Andor caught her and guided her to a\nchair, whereon she sank half fainting, with eyes closed and cheeks and\nlips the colour of ashes.\n\nJust for the moment the wild thought flew through his mind that she had\nbeen induced to drink by one of the men, but a closer look on her wan,\npale face and into those dilated eyes of hers convinced him that the\ngirl was in real and acute mental distress.\n\nHe went up to the table and poured out a mug of wine, which he held to\nher lips. She drank eagerly, looking up at him the while with a\nstrangely pathetic, eagerly appealing gaze.\n\nWhen he had taken the mug from her and replaced it on the table, he drew\na chair close to her and said as kindly as he could, for he did not feel\nvery well-disposed toward the girl who was the cause of much unhappiness\nto Elsa:\n\n\"Now, Klara, you are going to tell me what is the matter with you.\"\n\nBut already she had recovered herself a little, and Lakatos Andor's\nsomewhat dictatorial tone grated upon her sensitive ear.\n\n\"There's nothing the matter with me,\" she retorted, with a return of her\nhabitual flippancy. \"What should be the matter?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said dryly; \"and, of course, if you tell me that it's\na private affair of your own and none of my business, why I'll be quite\nsatisfied, and not ask any more questions. But if it's anything to do\nwith B\u00c3\u00a9la .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"No, of course not,\" she broke in impatiently. \"What should B\u00c3\u00a9la have to\ndo with my affairs? B\u00c3\u00a9la has been gone from here this hour past.\"\n\n\"And he is not coming back?\" asked Andor searchingly.\n\n\"I trust not,\" she replied fervently, and the young man noticed that\nthe staring, terror-filled look once more crept into her eyes.\n\n\"Very well, then,\" he said, rising, \"that is all I wanted to know. I am\nsorry to have disturbed you. Good-night, Klara.\"\n\n\"Good-night,\" she murmured.\n\nHe turned to go, and already his hand was on the latch of the door when\nan involuntary cry, like a desperate appeal, escaped her lips.\n\n\"Andor!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" he said, speaking over his shoulder.\n\nHe didn't like the girl: she had been offensive and insolent to Elsa,\nthe cause of Elsa's tears; but just now, when he turned back in answer\nto that piteous call from her, she looked so forlorn, so pathetic, so\nterrified that all the kindliness and chivalry which are inherent in the\ntrue Magyar peasant rose up in his heart to plead on her behalf.\n\n\"You were quite right just now, Andor,\" she murmured. \"I am in\ntrouble--in grave, terrible trouble. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Is there anything I can do to help you?\" he asked. \"No, no, don't get\nup,\" he added hurriedly, for she had tried to rise and obviously was\nstill unable to stand, \"just stay where you are, and I'll come and sit\nnear you. Is there anything I can do to help you?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" she whispered under her breath.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you'll think of me.\"\n\n\"Never mind what I think,\" he said, a little impatiently; \"if there's\nanything I can do to help you in your trouble I'll do it, but of course\nI can do nothing unless you tell me all about it.\"\n\nShe was trying to make up her mind to tell him, but it was desperately\ndifficult.\n\nShe had always been so careful of her reputation--so careful that not a\nbreath of real scandal should fall on her. She, of the downtrodden race,\nthe Jewess whom even the meanest of the peasant girls thought it her\nright to despise, had been doubly careful not to give any loophole for\ngossip. She flirted with all the men, of course--openly and sometimes\ninjudiciously, as in the case of Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la on the eve of his\nwedding-day; but up to now she had never given any cause for scandal,\nnor anyone the right to look down on her for any other reason but that\nof her race and blood, which she could not help.\n\nIt was hard, therefore, to have to own to something that distinctly\nsavoured of intrigue, and this to a man who she felt had no cause to be\nher friend. But the situation was desperate; there was that madman\noutside! God only knew of what he would be capable if he found that his\njealous suspicions had some measure of foundation! And the young\nCount--ready to walk presently, without thought of coming danger, into\nthe very clutches of that lunatic.\n\nThat of course was unthinkable. There had been murder in Leo's pale eyes\nwhen he fingered that awful-looking knife. The girl felt that such a\nrisk could not be run: even the good opinion of the entire village\nbecame as nothing in her mind.\n\nAnd of course there was the hope and chance that Andor would be\nchivalrous enough to hold his tongue. The young man's keen eyes had\nwatched every phase of the conflict which was so distinctly reflected in\nthe Jewess's mobile face. He waited patiently until he saw determination\ngradually asserting its sway over her hesitation. The girl interested\nhim, and she was evidently in great trouble. Though he had no liking for\nher, he was anxious to know what had disturbed her so terribly and\ngenuinely intended to be of use to her. He had no doubt that the\ntrouble had something to do with Leopold Hirsch. Everyone knew the\nlatter's jealous disposition, and Andor had not been home half a day\nbefore he had heard plenty of gossip on the subject.\n\n\"Well, Klara?\" he asked quietly after awhile, when he saw that she\nappeared to be more calm and more able to speak coherently. \"You don't\ndeny that you are in trouble. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. You have half made up your mind to\ntell me. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Well, then, out with it. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. What is it?\"\n\n\"Only that Leopold is a swine,\" she blurted out roughly.\n\n\"Why? What has he done?\"\n\n\"Jealous,\" she said; \"like a madman.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"And I'm at my wits' end, Andor,\" she moaned appealingly. \"I don't know\nwhat to do.\"\n\n\"Hadn't you better tell me, then?\"\n\nShe threw back her head and looked him squarely in the face with a\nsudden determination to end the present agonizing suspense at all costs.\n\n\"It is about young Count Feri.\"\n\n\"My lord?\" he exclaimed--for, indeed, up to this last moment he had been\nquite sure in his mind that her trouble had to do with Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la and\nwith her impudent flirtation of this afternoon.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said sullenly, \"he's a little sweet on me, you know--he\nadmires me and thinks me amusing--he likes to come here sometimes, when\nhe gets tired of starchy Countesses and Baronesses over at his castle.\nHe means no harm,\" she added fiercely, \"and if Leo wasn't such a beast\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"He has found you out, has he?\" commented Andor dryly.\n\n\"Not exactly. There was nothing to find out. But Count Feri wanted to\ncome and see me this evening to say 'good-bye,' as he is off to-morrow\nfor some weeks to shoot bears. He couldn't come till about ten o'clock,\nand didn't want to be seen walking into the tap-room at that hour of the\nnight. There is the back door, you know,\" she continued, talking a\nlittle excitedly and volubly, \"which my father always keeps locked and\nthe key in his pocket, and Count Feri wanted me to give him the\nduplicate key, so that he could slip in that way unobserved.\"\n\n\"Hm!\" mused Andor. \"What would your father have said to that?\"\n\n\"Father is going to Kecskem\u00c3\u00a9t presently by the nine o'clock train.\"\n\n\"And Leopold?\"\n\n\"Leopold was going with him. He was to have gone to Fiume with the\nexpress to-morrow to meet his brother, who is coming home from America.\"\n\n\"Well--and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0?\"\n\n\"Well! He has changed his mind. He is not going to Fiume. He was\nwatching me all the afternoon like a regular spy. People had told him\nthat at the banquet to-day Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la had been very attentive, so one of\nhis jealous fits was on him.\"\n\n\"Not without cause, I imagine,\" said Andor, with a sarcastic laugh.\n\n\"Of course you would stick up for him,\" she retorted; \"men always band\nthemselves together against an unfortunate girl. But Leo has behaved\nlike a brute. He watched me while my lord was talking to me, and caught\nsnatches of our conversation. Then my lord sent him out of the room to\nlook after his horse whilst he pressed me to give him the key of the\nback door.\"\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\n\"How could I guess that Leopold would be such a swine! It seems that\nwhen he came back he peeped into father's room and noticed at once that\nthe key was gone. He guessed, of course--now he has threatened to tell\nfather if I attempt to go out of this house. He won't let me out of his\nsight, and yet I must go and give Count Feri a warning and get that key\nback from him. If Leo tells father, father will half kill me, and\nalready Leo has threatened to strangle me if he finds me on the high\nroad on my way to the castle. My lord suspects nothing, of course .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\nshe added, while tears of impotence and of terror choked the words in\nher throat. \"He'll come here presently, and as like as not Leopold will\ndo for him.\"\n\nShe burst into a passionate fit of weeping. Andor waited quietly until\nthe first paroxysm of sobs had subsided, and she could hear what he\nsaid, then he remarked quite quietly:\n\n\"As like as not, as you say.\"\n\n\"But I won't have him hurt,\" she murmured through her tears. \"Leo would\nkill him for sure. You don't know, Andor, what Leopold is like when the\njealous rage is in him. He is outside this house now, watching. And\nthere he will stand and wait and watch; and he will waylay Count Feri\nwhen he comes, and stab him with a hideous knife which he always carries\nin his pocket. Oh! It's horrible!\" she moaned, \"horrible! I don't know\nwhat to do. What can I do? Andor, tell me, what can I do?\"\n\n\"What would you like to do?\" he asked more gently, for indeed the girl's\ngrief and terror were pitiable to behold.\n\n\"Run over to the castle,\" she replied, \"and get the key back from Count\nFeri, and tell him on no account to come to-night. It is only a step; I\ncould be back here in half an hour, and father is asleep in the next\nroom. I should be back before he need start for the station. But Leopold\nis watching outside. He declared that he would strangle me or else tell\nfather if I set foot outside this house. He is a brute, isn't he?\"\n\n\"Well, you see, my dear Klara, I understand that you are tokened to\nLeopold now, and a man has a way of thinking that his affianced wife is\nhis own, and not for other men to hang round her and make a fool of\nhim!\"\n\n\"Curse him!\" she muttered savagely; \"I'll never marry him after this.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you will,\" he retorted, with a light laugh; \"you'll like him\nall the better presently for these outbursts of jealousy. A woman often\ngets fondest of the man she fears the most. But in the meanwhile you are\nat your wits' ends, eh, my pretty Klara? You can't think of any way out\nof your present difficulty, what? And to-night at ten o'clock there will\nbe an awful scandal and worse--murder, perhaps!--and where will you be\nafter that, eh, my pretty Klara? Even if your father does not break his\nstick over your shoulders, you'll have anyhow to leave this village, for\nthe village will be too hot to hold you. And as your father does mighty\ngood business at Marosfalva, he will not look too kindly on the daughter\nwho, by her scandalous conduct, has driven him to seek a precarious\nfortune elsewhere. The situation certainly is a desperate one for you,\nmy pretty one, what?\"\n\n\"You need not tell me all that, Andor,\" she said sullenly. \"Don't I know\nit?\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" he continued, slowly and deliberately, \"that there\nnever was a woman before quite so desperately in need of a friend as you\nare, eh, Klara?\"\n\n\"I have no friend,\" she murmured.\n\n\"A friend, I mean, who would go and do your errand for you over at the\ncastle, what?--and warn his young and noble lordship not to show his\naristocratic face in Marosfalva to-night.\"\n\n\"I haven't such a friend, Andor, unless you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Well! You don't want me to go out and kill Leopold Hirsch, do you?\" he\nsaid dryly.\n\n\"Of course not.\"\n\n\"Or engage him in a brawl while you run round to the castle?\"\n\n\"It would be no good. He'd only tell father,\" she said, while a shiver\nran through her body; \"and they would kill me on my return.\"\n\n\"Exactly. What you want is, to stay here quite quietly, just as if\nnothing had happened, whilst the friend of whom I spoke just now went\nand got back that key which is causing so much trouble.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, that's what I want, Andor,\" she cried eagerly; \"and if you\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Stop a bit,\" he broke in quietly; \"I didn't say that I was that friend,\ndid I?\"\n\n\"Then you are only tormenting me. It isn't kind when I'm in such\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to torment you, Klara,\" he said more softly. \"I will even\ngo so far as to say that I might be that useful friend. You understand?\"\n\n\"Yes! You'll make conditions for doing that friendly act for me. I\nunderstand well enough,\" she said, still speaking with fierce\nsullenness. \"What are your conditions?\" she asked.\n\n\"Look here, Klara,\" he replied earnestly, \"a bargain is a bargain, isn't\nit? I will get you out of this trouble, and what's more, I'll hold my\ntongue about it. But you leave Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la alone .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. understand?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Oh! You know well enough what I mean,\" he said, almost roughly now, for\nthe name of Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la, which he himself had brought into this matter,\nhad at once conjured up in his mind the painful visions of this\nafternoon--Elsa's tears, her humiliation and unhappiness--and had once\nmore hardened his heart against the woman who had been the cause of it\nall. \"You know well enough what I mean. Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la is full of vanity,\nyour attentions to-day pleased him, and he neglected Elsa as he had no\nright to do. Now I don't say for a moment that you meant any harm. It\nwas only your vanity that was pleasantly tickled too, but you made Elsa\nunhappy, and that is what I mean when I say that a bargain is a bargain.\nIf I get you out of your trouble to-night, you must leave Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la\nseverely alone in the future.\"\n\n\"You are a fine one to preach,\" she retorted, with a harsh laugh. \"As if\nyou weren't in love with Elsa, though Elsa will be B\u00c3\u00a9la's wife\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"My being in love with Elsa has nothing to do with the matter. Nor am I\npreaching to you. You want me to do you a service and I've told you my\nprice. You can accept it or not as you please.\"\n\n\"I can't help Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la running after me,\" came as a final sullen\nprotest from the girl.\n\n\"Then you will have to try and help it, that's all,\" he said\nemphatically, \"if you want me to help you.\"\n\nShe said nothing for a moment, whilst her dark eyes searched his own,\ntrying to see how much determination lay behind that stern-looking face\nof his, then she murmured gently:\n\n\"And if I promise .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. what you want me to promise, Andor .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. will\nyou go and see Count Feri at once?\"\n\n\"A promise isn't enough,\" he said.\n\n\"An oath, then?\"\n\n\"Yes. An oath.\"\n\n\"And you will bring me back that abominable key, and tell Count Feri\njust what has happened.\"\n\n\"If you will swear,\" he insisted.\n\n\"Yes, yes, I will swear,\" she cried eagerly now, for indeed a heavy load\nhad been lifted off her heart, and her natural buoyancy of temperament\nwas already reasserting its sway over her terrors and agony of mind.\n\"What do you want me to say?\"\n\n\"Swear by Almighty God,\" he said earnestly, \"to leave Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la alone,\nnever to flirt with him or do anything to cause Elsa the slightest\nunhappiness.\"\n\n\"I swear it by Almighty God,\" she said solemnly, \"and you need not be\nafraid,\" she added slowly; \"I will not break my oath.\"\n\n\"No! I am not afraid that you will, for if you do .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Well! we won't\ntalk about that,\" he continued more lightly. \"I suppose there isn't much\ntime to be lost.\"\n\n\"No, no, there isn't,\" she urged, \"and don't make straight for the main\nroad; go up the village first and then back through the fields; Leopold\nmight suspect something--one never knows.\"\n\n\"All right, Klara, I'll do my best. We can but pray that I shall find my\nlord at home, in which case I can be back in twenty minutes. I'll pick\nup a friend or even two when I return, as then we can all walk into the\ntap-room together. It won't be so conspicuous as if I came in alone.\nWhat is the time now?\" he asked.\n\nShe went to the partition door, opened it and peeped into her father's\nroom.\n\n\"Just ten minutes to nine,\" she said; \"father will have gone by the time\nyou come back.\"\n\n\"That'll be as well, won't it?\" he concluded, as he finally turned to\ngo. \"If you are not in the tap-room when I come back, what shall I do\nwith the key?\"\n\nShe pointed to a small brass tray which stood on the table in among the\nlitter of bottles, glasses, mugs and tobacco-jars.\n\n\"Just on there,\" she said, \"then if I come into the room later, I can\nsee it there at a glance; and oh! what a relief it will be!\"\n\nThe colour had come back to her cheeks. Indeed, she felt marvellously\ncheerful now and reassured. She knew that Andor would fulfil his share\nof the bargain, and the heavy cloud of trouble and of terror would be\npermanently lifted from her within the next half-hour.\n\nIn her usual, light-hearted, frivolous way she blew a kiss to Andor. But\nthe young man, without looking again on her, had already opened the\ndoor, and the next moment he had gone out into the dark night on his\nerrand of friendship.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\"I go where I shall be more welcome.\"\n\n\nIn the meanwhile, in the barn time had been flying along on the wings of\nenjoyment. Ever since six o'clock, when vespers were well over and the\ngipsies had struck up the first cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s, merry feet had been tripping it\nalmost incessantly.\n\nIt is amazing what a capacity the young Hungarian peasant--man or\nwoman--has for footing the national dance. With intervals of singing and\nof gossiping these young folk in the barn had been going on for over\nthree hours.\n\nAnd they were not even beginning to get tired. To the Hungarian\npeasants, be it remembered, the cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s is not merely a dance, though\nthey enjoy the movement, of course, the exhilaration and the excitement\nof the music, just as all healthy young animals would enjoy gambolling\non a meadow; there is a deeper meaning to these children of the plains\nin the sweet, sad strains of their songs and in the mazes and\nintricacies of their dance.\n\nThey put their whole life, their entire sentiment for country and\nsweetheart, in the music and in the dance, and the music and the dance\ngive outward expression to their feelings, speak in the language of\npoetry which they feel well enough, but which their untutored tongue\ncannot frame.\n\nA Hungarian peasant in sorrow or distress will probably, like his\nWestern prototype, seek to drown his grief in drink; far be it from his\nchronicler's mind to suggest that his sentiments are more elevated than\nthose of the peasantry of other nations, or his morality more sound. He\nwill get drunk, too, like men of other nations, but he will do it to the\naccompaniment of music. The gipsy band must be there, when he is in\ntrouble or in joy--one or two fiddles, perhaps a clarionet, always a\nczimbalom--just these few instruments to play his favourite songs. They\ndon't ease his sorrow, but they help to soothe it by bringing tears to\nhis eyes and softening the bitterness of his grief.\n\nAnd in joy he will invariably dance; when he is in love he will dance,\nfor the cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s helps him to explain to the girl whom he loves exactly\nwhat he feels for her. And she understands. One cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s will reveal to a\nHungarian village maid the state of her lover's heart far more clearly\nthan do all the whisperings behind hedges in more civilized lands.\n\nIt was in the cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s five years ago that Elsa had learned from Andor\nhow much he loved her; it was during the mazes of the dance that she was\nable to overcome her shyness and tell him mutely that she loved him in\nreturn.\n\nAnd now it was in the cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s that she was bidding farewell to-day to\nher girlhood and to the companions of her youth; to Jen\u00c3\u00b6 and M\u00c3\u00b3ritz, who\nhad loved her ardently and hopelessly these past two years, and who must\nhenceforth become to her mere friends. It was in the turns and the\ntwirls, with the wild music marking step, that she conveyed all that\nthere was in her simple heart of regret for the past and cheerful\nanticipation for the future.\n\nElsa was a perfect dancer; it was a joy to have her for a partner, and\nshe was indefatigable this afternoon. It seemed as if living fire was in\nher blood, her cheeks glowed, her eyes shone like dark-blue stars; she\ngave herself neither rest nor respite. Determined to enjoy every minute\nof the day, she had forcibly put behind her the sorrowful incidents of\nthe afternoon. She would not remember and she would not think.\n\nAndor was not here, and as the spirit of music and of dancing crept more\nand more into her brain, she almost got to the stage of believing that\nhis appearance to-day had only been a dream. Nor would she look to see\nif Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la were here.\n\nShe knew that he had gone off soon after dancing began. He had slipped\naway quietly, and at first no one had noticed his absence. He had always\nprofessed a lofty contempt for gipsy music and for the cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s, a\ncontempt which has of late come into fashion in Hungary among the upper\nclasses, and has unfortunately been aped by those whose so-called\neducation has only succeeded in obliterating the fine national spirit of\nthe past without having the power to graft more modern Western culture\ninto this Oriental race.\n\nEr\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la belonged to this same supercilious set, and had made many\nenemies by his sarcastic denunciations of things that were almost\nthought sacred in Marosfalva. It was therefore quite an understood thing\nthat the moment a cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s was struck up, Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la at once went to seek\namusement elsewhere.\n\nOf course to-day was a very different occasion to the more usual village\nentertainments. To-day he should have thought of nothing but his\nfianc\u00c3\u00a9e's pleasure. She was over-fond of dancing, and looked a picture\nwhen she danced. It was clearly a bridegroom's duty, under these\ncircumstances, to stand by and watch his fianc\u00c3\u00a9e with all the admiration\nthat should be filling his heart.\n\nAfter the wedding, if he disapproved of the cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s, why of course he\ncould forbid his wife to dance it, and there would be an end of the\nmatter. To-day he was still the groom, the servant of his\nfianc\u00c3\u00a9e--to-morrow only would he become her master.\n\nBut everyone was so intent upon enjoyment that a long time went by\nbefore gossip occupied itself exclusively with Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la's absence from\nhis pre-nuptial feast. When once it began it raged with unusual\nbitterness. The scandal during the banquet was being repeated now. B\u00c3\u00a9la\nwas obviously sitting in the tap-room of the inn, flirting with the\nJewess, when he should have been in attendance on his bride.\n\nElsa could not help but hear the comments that were being made by all\nthe mothers and fathers and older people who were not dancing, and who,\ntherefore, had plenty of leisure for talk. All the proprieties were\nbeing outraged--so it was declared--and Elsa, who might have married so\nwell at one time, was indeed now an object of pity.\n\nShe hated to hear all this talk, and felt hideously ashamed that people\nshould be pitying her. Vainly did she try to get some measure of comfort\nfrom her mother. Kapus Irma, irritated by the looks of commiseration\nwhich were being levelled at her daughter, dubbed the latter a fool for\nnot having the sense to know how to keep her bridegroom by her side.\n\nIt was past eight o'clock before B\u00c3\u00a9la put in an appearance at all.\n\nA cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s was in full swing. The compact group of dancers was crowded\nround the musicians' platform, for the cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s can only be properly\ndanced under the very bow--as it were--of the gipsy leader. The barn\nlooked gaily lighted up with oil-lamps swinging down from the rafters\nabove, and it had been most splendidly decorated for the occasion with\nfestoons of paper flowers and tri-colour flags. Petticoats and ribbons\nwere flying, little feet in red leather boots were kicking up clouds of\ndust.\n\nThere was no moon to-night, the sky was heavy with clouds, so the\nvillage street had been very dark. Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la blinked as he entered the\nbarn, so dazzling did the picture present itself to his gaze.\n\nAnd there was such an atmosphere of merriment and of animation about the\nplace that instinctively B\u00c3\u00a9la's thoughts flew back to the dismal and\ndingy little tap-room whence he had just come, with a few drunken\nfellows sprawling in corners and Leopold Hirsch's ugly face leering out\nof the shadows.\n\nHere everyone was gay and good-tempered. The gipsies scraped their\nfiddles till one would have thought their arms would break, the young\npeople danced, the men shouted and sang. It was a pandemonium of\ngiddiness and music and laughter.\n\nAnd B\u00c3\u00a9la, as he blinked and looked upon the scene, remembered that he\nhad paid for it all. He had paid for the hire of the barn, the music and\nthe lighting; he had paid for the lavish supper which would be served\npresently. And as he had had more silvorium to drink in the tap-room\nthan was altogether good for the clearness of his brain, he fell to\nthinking that he ought now to be received and welcomed with all the\ndeference which his lavishness deserved. He thought that the young\npeople should have left off dancing when he appeared, and should have\ngreeted him, as they would undoubtedly have greeted my lord the Count,\nhad the latter deigned to come.\n\nAnd what, after all, was my lord on such an occasion in comparison with\nthe donor of the feast?\n\nEven Elsa--though she must, of course, have seen him--did not stop in\nher senseless gyrations. She was dancing with Barna M\u00c3\u00b3ritz--the mayor's\nyoungest son and a splendid dancer--and the two young people went on\ntwirling and twisting and flirting and laughing just as if he--the real\nhost--had not been there.\n\nEnraged at all this indifference, this want of recognition of his\ndignity, he elbowed his way through the dense group of spectators which\nformed a phalanx round the dancers. The wide and voluminous petticoats\nof the women formed a veritable hedge through which he had to scramble\nand to push. As the people recognized him they gave him pleasant\ngreetings, for the Hungarian peasant is by nature kindly and something\nof an opportunist; there was no occasion to quarrel openly with Er\u00c3\u00b6s\nB\u00c3\u00a9la, who was rich and influential.\n\nBut he paid no heed either to the greetings or to the whispered comments\nthat followed in their wake. He just felt that he was the master of this\nplace, and he meant everyone else to know and acknowledge this fact. So\nhe strode up to the czig\u00c3\u00a1ny and ordered them peremptorily to draw this\ninterminable cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s to an end; it had lasted quite long enough, he\nsaid, and the girls looked a sight with their crimson, perspiring faces;\nhe was not going to have such vulgar goings-on at any of his wedding\nfeasts.\n\nThe gipsy leader never thought of disobeying, of course; it was the\n_tekintetes \u00c3\u00bar_ (honoured gentleman) who was paying them for their work,\nand they had to do as they were told.\n\nDespite loud protests from the dancers, the cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s was brought to a\nlovely and whirling close. Panting, hot and beaming, the dancers now\nmingled with the rest of the throng, and a pandemonium of laughter and\nchatter soon filled the barn from end to end.\n\nElsa, in accordance with the custom which holds sway even at village\ndances, was even now turning to walk away with her partner, whose duty\nit was to conduct her to her mother's side. She felt wrathful with\nB\u00c3\u00a9la--as wrathful, at least, as so gentle a creature could be. She was\nashamed of his behaviour, ashamed for herself as well as for him, and\nshe didn't want to speak with him just now.\n\nBut he, still feeling dictatorial and despotic, had not yet finished\nasserting his authority. He called to her loudly and peremptorily:\n\n\"Elsa! I want a word with you.\"\n\n\"I'll come directly, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" she replied, speaking over her shoulder. \"I\nwant to speak to mother for a minute.\"\n\n\"You can speak to her later,\" he rejoined roughly. \"I want a word with\nyou now.\"\n\nAnd without more ado he pushed his way up close to Elsa's side, elbowing\nBarna M\u00c3\u00b3ritz with scant ceremony. An angry word rose to the younger\nman's lips, and a sudden quarrel was only averted by a pleading look\nfrom Elsa's blue eyes. It would have been very unseemly, of course, to\nquarrel with one's host on such an occasion. M\u00c3\u00b3ritz, swallowing his\nwrath, withdrew without a word, even though he cursed B\u00c3\u00a9la for a brute\nunder his breath.\n\nB\u00c3\u00a9la took Elsa's arm and led her aside out of the crowd.\n\n\"You know,\" he said roughly, \"how I hate you to mix with that rowdy lot\nlike you do; and you know that I look on the cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s as indecent and\nvulgar. Why do you do it?\"\n\n\"The rowdy lot, as you call them, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" she replied firmly, \"are my\nfriends, and the cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s is a dance which all true Magyars dance from\nchildhood.\"\n\n\"I don't choose to allow my wife to dance it,\" he retorted.\n\n\"And after to-morrow I will obey you, B\u00c3\u00a9la. To-day I asked my mother if\nI might dance. And she said yes.\"\n\n\"Your mother's a fool,\" he muttered.\n\n\"And remember that to-night I take leave of my girlhood,\" she said\ngently, determined not to quarrel. \"My friends like to monopolize me\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. it's only natural.\"\n\n\"Well! They are not my friends, anyway, and I'd rather you did not dance\nanother cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s to-night.\"\n\n\"I am sorry, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" she said quietly, \"but I have promised Feh\u00c3\u00a9r K\u00c3\u00a1roly\nand also Jen\u00c3\u00b6. They would be disappointed if I broke my promise.\"\n\n\"Then they'll have to be disappointed, that's all.\"\n\nShe made no reply, but looking at her face, which he saw in profile, he\ncould not fail to note that her lips were tightly set and that there was\nan unwonted look of determination round her mouth. He drew in his\nbreath, for he was quite ready for a second conflict of will to-day,\nnor, this time, was the issue for a moment in doubt in his mind. Women\nwere made to obey--their parents first and then their husbands. In this\ncase B\u00c3\u00a9la knew well enough that his authority was fully backed by that\nof Elsa's mother--the invalid father, of course, didn't count, but Kapus\nIrma wanted that house on the Kender Road, she wanted the servant and\nthe oxen, the chickens and the pigs, she wanted all the ease and the\nluxury which her rich son-in-law would give her.\n\nNo! There was no fear that Elsa would break her tokened word. In this\nsemi-Oriental land, where semi-Oriental thought prevails, girls do not\ndo that sort of thing--if they do, it is to their own hurt, and Elsa was\nnot of the stuff of which rebellious or perjured women are made.\n\nTherefore B\u00c3\u00a9la now had neither fear nor compunction in asserting that\nauthority which would be his to the full to-morrow. He felt that there\nwas a vein of rebellion in Elsa's character, and this he meant to drain\nand to staunch till it had withered to nothingness. It would never do\nfor him--of all men--to have a rebellious or argumentative wife.\n\n\"Well, then, that's settled,\" he said, with absolute finality, \"you can\ngo and talk to your precious friends as much as you like, so long as you\nbehave yourself as a tokened bride should, but I will not have you dance\nthat abominable cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s again to-night.\"\n\n\"And have you behaved to-day, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" she retorted quite gently, \"as a\ntokened bridegroom should?\"\n\n\"That's nothing to do with it,\" he replied, with a harsh laugh. \"I am a\nman, and you are a girl, and even the most ignorant Hungarian peasant\nwill tell you that there is a vast difference there. But I am not going\nto argue about it with you, my dear. I merely forbid you to dance a\ndance which I consider indecent. That's all.\"\n\n\"And I am sorry, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" she said, speaking at least as firmly as he did,\n\"but I have given my promise, and even you would not wish me to break my\nword.\"\n\n\"You mean to disobey me, then?\" he asked.\n\n\"Certainly not after to-morrow. To-day I have my mother's permission,\nand I am going to dance one cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s now with Feh\u00c3\u00a9r K\u00c3\u00a1roly and one after\nsupper again with Jen\u00c3\u00b6.\"\n\nThey had both unconsciously raised their voices during these last few\nwords, and thus aroused the attention of some of the folk, who had stood\nby to listen. Of course, everyone knew of B\u00c3\u00a9la's aversion to the\ncs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s, and curiosity prompted gaffers and gossips to try and hear what\nwould be the end of this argument between the pretty bride--who\ncertainly looked rather wilful and obstinate now--and her future lord\nand master.\n\n\"Well said, little Elsa!\" came now in ringing accents from the foremost\ngroup in the little crowd; \"we must see you dance the cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s once or\ntwice more before that ogre has the authority to shut you up in his\ncastle.\"\n\n\"Moreover, your promise has been made to me,\" asserted Feh\u00c3\u00a9r K\u00c3\u00a1roly\nlustily, \"and I certainly shall not release you from it.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" added Jen\u00c3\u00b6.\n\n\"Don't you listen to B\u00c3\u00a9la, my little Elsa,\" said one of the older women;\n\"you are still a free girl to-day. You just do as you like--to-morrow\nwill be time enough to do as he tells you.\"\n\nBut this opinion the married men present were not prepared to endorse,\nand one or two minor arguments and lectures ensued anent a woman's duty\nof obedience.\n\nB\u00c3\u00a9la had said nothing while these chaffing remarks were being passed\nover his head; and now that public attention was momentarily diverted\nfrom him, he took Elsa's hand and passed it under his arm.\n\n\"You had better go to your mother now, hadn't you?\" he said, with what\nseemed like perfect calm. \"You said just now that you wished to speak to\nher.\"\n\nElsa allowed him to lead her away. She tried vainly to guess what was\ngoing on in his mind. She knew, of course, that he must be very angry.\nEr\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la beaten in an argument was at no time a very pleasant customer,\nand now he surely was raging inwardly, for he had set his heart on\nexerting his authority over this matter of the cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s and had signally\nfailed.\n\nBut she could not see how he felt, for he kept his face averted from her\ninquiring gaze.\n\nKapus Irma greeted her future son-in-law with obvious acerbity.\n\n\"I hear you have been teasing Elsa again,\" she said crossly. \"Why can't\nyou let her enjoy herself just for to-night, without interfering with\nher?\"\n\n\"Oh! I am not going to interfere with her,\" he replied, with a sneer.\n\"You have given her such perfect lessons of disobedience and obstinacy\nthat it will take me all my time in the future to drill her into proper\nwifely shape. But to-night I am not going to interfere with her. She has\ntold me plainly that she means to do just as she likes and that you have\ngiven her leave to defy me. Public opinion, it seems, is all in her\nfavour too. So I have just brought your dutiful daughter back to you,\nand now I am free to make myself scarce.\"\n\n\"To make yourself scarce?\" exclaimed Irma. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Just what I say. I am not going to stay here, where I am jeered at by a\nlot of loutish, common peasants, who seem to have forgotten that I am\npaying for their enjoyment and for all the food and drink which they\nwill consume presently. However, that's neither here nor there. Everyone\nseems to look upon this entertainment as Elsa's feast, and upon Elsa as\nthe hostess and the queen. I am so obviously in the way and of no\nconsequence. I go where I shall be more welcome.\"\n\nHe had dropped Elsa's arm and was turning to go, but Irma had caught\nhold of his coat.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" she gasped.\n\n\"That's nothing to do with you, is it, Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni?\" he replied dryly.\n\n\"Indeed it is,\" she retorted; \"why, you can't go away like that--not\nbefore supper--you can't for Elsa's sake--what would everybody say?\"\n\n\"I don't care one brass fill\u00c3\u00a9r what anybody says, Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni, and you\nknow it. As for Elsa, why should I consider her? She has plenty of\nfriends to stand by her, it seems, in her disobedience to my wishes. She\nhas openly defied me, and made me look a fool. I am not going to stand\nthat, so I go elsewhere--or I might do or say something which I might be\nsorry for later on--see?\"\n\nHe tried to speak quietly and not to raise his voice, but it was also\nobvious that self-control was costing him a mightily vigorous effort,\nfor the veins in his temples were standing up like cords, and his one\neye literally shone with a sinister and almost cruel glow.\n\nKapus Irma turned to her daughter.\n\n\"Elsa,\" she said fretfully, \"don't be such a goose. I won't have you\nquarrelling with B\u00c3\u00a9la like this, just before your wedding. Just you kiss\nhim now, and tell him you didn't mean to vex him. We can't have\neverybody gossiping about this affair! My goodness! As if a cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s or\ntwo mattered.\" .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\n\nBut here B\u00c3\u00a9la's harsh laugh broke in on her mutterings.\n\n\"Don't waste your breath, Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni,\" he said roughly. \"Even if Elsa\nwere to come and beg my pardon now I would not remain here. I don't care\nfor such tardy, perfunctory obedience, and this she will learn by and\nby. For to-night, if you and she feel ashamed and uncomfortable, well!\nso much the better. Village gossip doesn't affect me in the least. I do\nas I like, and let all the chattering women go to h----l. Good-night,\nIrma n\u00c3\u00a9ni--good-night, Elsa! I hope you will be in a better frame of\nmind to-morrow.\"\n\nAnd before Kapus Irma could detain him or utter another protest, he was\ngone, and she turned savagely on her daughter.\n\n\"Elsa!\" she said, \"you are never going to let us all be shamed like\nthis? Run after him at once, and bring him back!\"\n\n\"He wouldn't come back, mother, if I begged him ever so .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" said Elsa\ndrearily; \"and besides--where should I find him?\"\n\n\"On his way to Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein's, of course. If you run you can easily\novertake him.\"\n\n\"I can't, mother,\" protested Elsa; \"how can I?\"\n\n\"You'll just do as I tell you, my girl!\" said Irma firmly, and with a\nsnap of her lean jaws. \"By the Holy Virgin, child! Are you going to\ndisobey your mother now? God will punish you, you know, if you go on\nlike that. Go at once as I tell you. Run out by this door here. No one\nwill see you, you will overtake B\u00c3\u00a9la before he is half-way down the\nstreet, and then you must just bring him back. That's all.\"\n\nLong habits of obedience were so ingrained in the girl that at this\nmoment--though she felt quite sure that all her attempts would be in\nvain, and though she felt bitterly humiliated at having to make such\nattempts--she never thought of openly defying her mother. Indeed, she\nquite believed that God would punish her if she rebelled so constantly,\nfor this had been drilled into her since her earliest childhood's days.\n\nFortunately for the moment everyone's attention was concentrated on a\ntable of liquid refreshments in a remote corner of the barn, and Elsa\nand her mother were practically isolated here, and the last little scene\nhad gone by unobserved.\n\nIrma picked a shawl from off her own shoulders and put it round her\ndaughter; then she gave her a final significant push. Elsa, with her\ntear-dimmed eyes, could scarcely find the little side door which was\nfashioned in the wooden wall itself, and gave direct access into the\nstreet.\n\nGod would punish her if she defied her mother; well! God's wrath must be\nharder to bear than the bitter humiliation to which her mother had so\nairily condemned her. To beg B\u00c3\u00a9la's forgiveness, to assure him of her\nobedience, to stand shamed before him and before all her friends, surely\nGod couldn't want her to do all that?\n\nBut already she had crossed the threshold and was out in the dark,\nsilent street. She ran on mechanically in the direction of the inn; her\nmother's commands seemed to be moving her along, for certainly her own\nwill had nothing to do with it. Her cheeks were aflame, and her eyes\nburned with all the tears which she would not shed, but she herself felt\ncold and numb, as she ran on blindly, stupidly, to where she had just\nseen a tiny speck of light.\n\nThe night was dark but exquisitely calm--perfectly still, yet full of\nthose mysterious whisperings which come from the bosom of the plain, the\nflutter of birds' wings, snug in their night's lodgings amongst the\ndrooping branches of pollarded willows, the quiver of the plumed heads\nof maize, touched by some fairy garment as it brushed by, the call of\nthe cricket from among the tall sunflowers and the quiver of the\nglow-worm on the huge pumpkin leaves.\n\nElsa knew all these soft whisperings; she was a child of this immense\nand majestic plain, and all the furtive little beasts that dwelt within\nits maze were bosom friends of hers.\n\nAt other times, when her mind and heart had been at peace, she loved\nthese dark, calm nights, when heavy clouds hid the light of the moon and\nsounds grew louder and more distinct as the darkness grew more tense;\nneither fluttering of unseen wings nor quiver of stealthy footsteps had\nthe power to startle her; they were all her friends, these tiny dwellers\nof the plain, these midnight marauders of whom townsfolk are always so\nafraid.\n\nAt first, when she perceived the tiny speck of light on ahead, she\nthought that it must be a glow-worm settled on the leaves of the dahlias\noutside the school-house, for glow-worms had been over-abundant this\nlate summer, but soon she saw that the burning speck was moving along,\non ahead in the same direction as she herself was going--on the way to\nIgn\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein's.\n\nB\u00c3\u00a9la had lighted a cigar when he left the barn; nursing his resentment,\nhe had walked along rapidly toward the inn, his head whirling with\nthoughts of the many things which he meant to do in order to be revenged\non Elsa this night.\n\nOf course a long visit to Klara fully entered into those schemes, and\nnow he paused just at the foot of the verandah steps breathing in the\nsoft evening air with fully dilated nostrils and lungs, so that his\nnerves might regain some semblance of that outward calm which his\ndignity demanded.\n\nAnd thus, standing still, he heard through the silence the patter of\nsmall, high-heeled boots upon the hard road. He guessed at once that\nElsa had been sent along by her mother to bring him back, and a\ncomforting glow of inward satisfaction went right through his veins as,\nafter a slight moment of hesitation, he made up his mind to await Elsa's\ncoming here, to listen to her apologies, to read her the lecture which\nshe fully deserved, but nevertheless to continue the plan of conduct\nwhich he had mapped out for himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\"On the eve of one's wedding day too.\"\n\n\nHe could not see Elsa till she was quite close to him, and even then he\ncould only vaguely distinguish the quaint contour of her wide-sleeved\nshift and of her voluminous petticoats.\n\nBut his cigar had gone out, and when Elsa stood quite close to him, and\nsoftly murmured his name, he struck a match very deliberately, and held\nit to the cigar so that it lighted up his face for a few seconds. He\nwanted her to see how indifferent was the expression in his eye, and\nthat there was not the slightest trace of a welcoming smile lurking\nround his lips.\n\nTherefore he held the lighted match close to his face much longer than\nwas necessary; he only dropped it when it began to scorch his fingers.\nThen he blew a big cloud of smoke out of his cigar straight into her\nface, and only after that did he say, speaking very roughly:\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Mother sent me, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" she said timidly, as she placed a trembling\nlittle hand on his coat-sleeve. \"I wouldn't have come, only she ordered\nme, and I couldn't disobey her, so I .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Couldn't disobey your mother, eh?\" he sneered; \"you couldn't defy her\nas you did me, what?\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to defy you, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" she said, striving with all her might\nto keep back the rebellious words which surged out of her overburdened\nheart to her quivering lips. \"I couldn't be unkind to Jen\u00c3\u00b6 and K\u00c3\u00a1roly,\nand all my old friends, just this last evening, when I am still a girl\namongst them.\"\n\n\"You preferred being obstinate and wilful toward me, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Don't let us quarrel, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" she pleaded.\n\n\"I am not quarrelling,\" he retorted. \"I came to the barn just now\nlooking forward to the pleasure of having you to myself for a little\nbit. There was a lot I wanted to say to you--just quietly, in a corner\nby our two selves. And how did I find you? Hot and panting, after an\nhour's gyrations, hardly able to stand, and certainly not able to speak;\nand at my simple request that you should give up a dance of which I\nwhole-heartedly disapprove, you turned on me with impudence and\nobstinacy. I suppose you felt yourself backed up by your former\nsweetheart, and thought you could just treat me like the dirt under your\nfeet.\"\n\nHe certainly had proved himself a good advocate in his own cause. The\ncase thus put succinctly and clearly before her appeared very black to\nElsa against herself. Ever ready for self-deprecation, she began to\nthink that indeed she had behaved in a very ugly, unwomanly and\naggressive manner, and her meekness cost her no effort now when she said\ngently:\n\n\"I am sorry, B\u00c3\u00a9la! I seem to have been all queer the whole of to-day. It\nis a very upsetting time for any girl, you must remember. But Pater\nBonif\u00c3\u00a1cius said that if any sin lay on my conscience since my last\nconfession, I could always find him in church at seven o'clock to-morrow\nmorning, before our wedding Mass, so as to be quite clear of sin before\nHoly Communion.\"\n\n\"That's all right, then,\" he said, with a hard laugh. \"You had better\nfind him in church to-morrow morning, and tell him that you have been\nwilful and perverse and disobedient. He'll give you absolution, no\ndoubt. So now you'd better go back to your dancing. Your many friends\nwill be pining for you.\"\n\n\"Won't you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. won't you come back with me, B\u00c3\u00a9la?\" she pleaded.\n\n\"No. I won't. I have told your mother plainly enough that I wasn't\ncoming back. So why she should have sent you snivelling after me, I\ncan't think.\"\n\n\"I think that even if mother hadn't sent me I should have come\nultimately. I am not quite sure, but I think I should have come. I know\nthat I have done wrong, but we are all of us obstinate and mistaken at\ntimes, aren't we, B\u00c3\u00a9la? It is rather hard to be so severely punished,\"\nshe added, with a wistful little sigh, \"on the eve of one's wedding day\ntoo, which should be one of the happiest days in a girl's life.\"\n\n\"Severely punished?\" he sneered. \"Bah! As if you wanted me over there.\nYou've got all your precious friends.\"\n\n\"But I do want you, B\u00c3\u00a9la. All the time that you were not in the barn\nthis afternoon I .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I felt lonesome.\"\n\n\"Then why didn't you send for your old sweetheart? He would have cheered\nyou up.\"\n\n\"Don't say that, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" she said earnestly, and once more her little\nhand grasped his coat-sleeve; \"you don't know how it hurts. I don't want\nto think of Andor. I only want to think of you, and if you would try and\nbe a little patient, I am sure that we would understand one another\nbetter very soon.\"\n\n\"I hope so, my dear,\" he rejoined dryly, \"for your sake--as I am not a\npatient man; let me tell you that. Come, give me a kiss and run back to\nyour mother. I can't bear to have a woman snivelling near me like that.\"\n\nHe drew her toward him with that rough, perfunctory gesture which\nbetokened the master rather than the lover. Then with one hand he raised\nher chin up and brought her face quite close to his. Even then he could\nnot see her clearly because of the heavy clouds in the sky. But the air\nseemed suddenly to have become absolutely still, not a breath of wind\nstirred the leaves of the acacia trees, and all those soft sighings and\nmysterious whisperings which make the plain always appear so full of\nlife were for the moment hushed. Only from far away came the murmur of\nthe sluggish waters of the Maros, and from its shores the call of a\nheron to its mate. Elsa made vigorous efforts to swallow her tears. The\nexquisite quietude of Nature, that call of the heron, the scent of dying\nflowers which lingered in the autumn air, made her feel more strongly\nthan she had ever felt before how beautiful life might have been.\n\nPater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius' words rang in her ears: \"You are going to be happy in\nGod's way, my child, which may not be your way, but must be an\ninfinitely better one.\"\n\nWell! For the moment Elsa didn't see how this was going to be done; she\ndid not see how she could ever be happy beside this tyrannical, arrogant\nman who would be, and meant to be, her master rather than her mate.\n\nEven now the searching look wherewith his one eye, with its sinister\nexpression, tried to read her very soul had in it more of pride of\npossession, more of the appraiser of goods than the ardour of a\nbridegroom. B\u00c3\u00a9la cursed the darkness which prevented his reading now\nevery line of that pure young face which was held up to his; he longed\nwith all the passionate masterfulness of his temperament to know\nexactly how much awe, how much deference, how much regard she felt for\nhim. Of love he did not think, nor did he care if it never came; but\nthis beautiful prize which had been coveted by so many was his at last,\nand he meant to mould it and wield it in accordance with his pleasure.\n\nBut in spite of his callousness and his selfishness, the intense\nwomanliness of the girl stirred the softer emotions of his heart; there\nwas so much freshness in her, so much beauty and so much girlishness\nthat just for one brief second a wave, almost of tenderness, swept over\nhis senses.\n\nHe kissed the pure young lips and drank in greedily their exquisite\nsweetness, then he said somewhat less harshly:\n\n\"You are too pretty, my dove, to put on those modern airs of emancipated\nwomanhood. If you only knew how much better you please me like this,\nthan when you try to argue with me, you would always use your power over\nme, you little goose.\"\n\nShe made no reply, for, despite the warm woollen shawl round her\nshoulders, she had suddenly felt cold, and a curious shiver had gone\nright through her body, even whilst her future lord did kiss her. But no\ndoubt it was because just then an owl had hooted in the poplar trees far\naway.\n\n\"You are coming back then, B\u00c3\u00a9la?\" she asked, after a few seconds of\nsilence and with enforced cheerfulness.\n\n\"I'll think about it,\" he said condescendingly.\n\n\"But .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"There, now, don't begin again,\" he broke in impatiently. \"Haven't I\nsaid that I'll think about it? You run back to your mother now. I may\ncome later--or I may not. But if you bother me much more I certainly\nwon't. If I come, I come of my own free will; there's no woman living\nwho has ever persuaded me to do anything against my will.\"\n\nAnd without vouchsafing her another word or look, without deigning to\nsee her safely on her way back to the barn, he turned leisurely on his\nheel, and mounting the steps of the verandah before him, he presently\npushed open the tap-room door and disappeared within.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\"If you loved me.\"\n\n\nElsa stood for a moment quite still there in the dark, with the silence\nof the night and all its sweet sounds encompassing her, and the scent of\nwithered flowers and slowly-dying leaves mounting to her quivering\nnostrils.\n\nWhat did it all mean? What did life mean? And what was the meaning of\nGod? She, the ignorant, unsophisticated peasant girl, knew nothing save\nwhat Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius had taught her, and that was little enough--though\nthe little was hard enough to learn.\n\nResignation to God's will; obedience to parents first and to husband\nafterwards; renunciation of all that made the days appear like a\ncontinual holiday and filled the nights with exquisite dreams!\n\nBut if life only meant that, only meant duty and obedience and\nresignation, then why had God made such a beautiful world, why had He\nmade the sky and the birds and the flowers, the nodding plumes of maize\nand the tiny, fleecy clouds which people the firmament at sunset?\n\nWas it worth while to deck this world in such array if the eyes of men\nwere always to be filled with tears, and their backs bent to their\never-recurring tasks?\n\nA heavy sigh escaped from the girl's overburdened heart: the riddle of\nthe universe was too hard an one for her simple mind to solve. Perhaps\nit was best after all not to think of these things which she was too\nignorant to understand. She looked at the door of the tavern through\nwhich B\u00c3\u00a9la had gone. He had left it wide open, and she caught a glimpse\nof him now as he sat at one of the tables, and leaning his elbow on it,\nrested his chin in his hand.\n\nThen, with another little sigh, she was just turning to go when the\nsound of her name spoken in a whisper and quite close to her sent her\npulses quivering and made her heart beat furiously.\n\n\"Elsa! Wait a moment!\"\n\n\"Is that you, Andor?\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes. I came up just now and heard your voice and B\u00c3\u00a9la's. I waited on\nthe off-chance of getting a word with you.\"\n\n\"I mustn't stop, Andor. Mother will be wondering.\"\n\n\"No, she won't,\" he retorted with undisguised bitterness. \"The mother\nwho sent you on this abominable and humiliating errand won't worry much\nafter you.\"\n\n\"No one seems to worry much about me, do they, Andor?\" she said, a\nlittle wistfully.\n\nHe drew a little closer to her, so close that he could feel her shoulder\nunder the shawl quivering against his arm. Her many petticoats brushed\nabout his shins, and he could hear her quick, warm breath as it came and\nwent. He bent his head quite close to her, as he had done that day, five\nyears ago, in the mazes of the cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s, and now--as then--his lips\nalmost touched her soft young neck.\n\n\"Then why should you worry about them, Elsa?\" he whispered slowly in her\near. \"Why shouldn't you let them all be?\"\n\n\"Let them all be?\" she said. \"But everyone will be wondering if I don't\ngo back--at least for supper.\"\n\n\"I don't mean about the dance and the supper, Elsa,\" he continued, still\nspeaking in a whisper and striving to subdue the hoarseness in his voice\nwhich was engendered by the passion which burned in his veins, \"I don't\nonly mean to-night. I mean .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. for good.\" .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\n\n\"For good?\" she repeated slowly.\n\n\"Let me take you away, Elsa,\" he entreated, \"away from here. Leave all\nthese rough, indifferent and selfish folk. Come out with me to\nAustralia, and let all these people be.\"\n\nAt first, of course, she didn't understand him; but gradually his\nmeaning became clear and she gave one long, horrified gasp.\n\n\"Andor! How can you?\"\n\n\"It has been borne upon me, Elsa, these hours past, that I am a coward\nand a villain to let you go on with this miserable life. Nay! it's worse\nthan that, for your future life with that bully, that brute, will be far\nmore wretched than you have any idea now. He doesn't care for you,\nElsa--not really--not as I care for you, not as you--the sweetest,\ngentlest, purest woman in the world--should be cared for and cherished.\nHe doesn't love you, Elsa, he doesn't even really want you--not as I\nwant you--I, who would give my life, every drop of my blood, to have you\nfor myself alone!\"\n\nGradually, as he spoke, his arms had clasped round her, his passionate\nwhispers came in short gasps to her ear. Gently now she disengaged\nherself.\n\n\"But I am tokened to B\u00c3\u00a9la, Andor,\" she said gently. \"To-morrow is my\nwedding day. I have made my confession. Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius has prepared me\nfor Holy Communion. My word is pledged to B\u00c3\u00a9la.\"\n\n\"He doesn't love you, Elsa, and he is not your husband yet. Your pledged\nword does not bind you before God. To-day you are still free. You are\nfree until you have sworn before the altar of God. Elsa! B\u00c3\u00a9la doesn't\nwant you, he doesn't love you. And I love you and want you with my\nwhole heart and soul.\"\n\n\"Don't speak like that, Andor, don't,\" she almost pleaded. \"You must\nknow how wrong it is for you to speak and for me to listen.\"\n\n\"But I must speak, Elsa,\" he urged, \"and you have got to listen. We\ncould get away now, Elsa, to-night, by the nine-twenty train. Over at\nthe barn no one would know that you had gone until it got too late to\nrun after you. Never mind about your clothes. I have plenty of money in\nmy pocket, and to-morrow when we get to Budapesth we can get what you\nwant. By the next day we should be in Fiume, and then we would embark on\nthe first ship that is outward bound. I know just how to manage, Elsa.\nYou would have nothing to do, nothing to think of, but just give\nyourself over into my keeping. You are a free woman, Elsa, bound to no\none, and the first opportunity we had we would get married. Out there in\nAustralia I can get plenty of work and good pay: we shouldn't be rich,\nElsa--not as rich as you would be if you married Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la, but by God I\nswear that we would be happy, for every minute of my life would be\ndevoted to your happiness.\"\n\nAll the while that he spoke she had made persistent efforts to disengage\nherself from his grasp. She felt that she must get away from him, away\nfrom his insinuating voice, from the ardour of those whispered words\nwhich seemed to burn into her very soul. The very night seemed to be in\nleague with him, the darkness and the silence and all those soft sounds\nof gently-murmuring river and calls of birds and beasts, and the\nfragrance of dying flowers which numbed the senses and obliterated the\nthought of God, of duty and of parents.\n\n\"No, no, Andor,\" she murmured feebly, \"you have no right to speak like\nthat. I am tokened to B\u00c3\u00a9la. I have sworn that I would be his wife. My\nhand was in his and the Pater blessed us; and it was after Holy\nCommunion and when Christ Himself was in my heart! And there is mother\ntoo and father, the house which B\u00c3\u00a9la promised them, the oxen and the\npigs, a maid to look after father. Mother would curse me if I cheated\nher of all that now.\"\n\n\"When we are settled in Australia,\" he pleaded earnestly, \"we will write\nto your parents and send them money to come out and join us.\"\n\n\"Father is paralysed. How could he come? And mother would curse me. And\na mother's curse, Andor, is registered by God.\"\n\n\"Elsa, if you loved me you would leave father and mother and come with\nme.\"\n\n\"Then perhaps I do not love you, Andor,\" she said slowly, \"for I could\nnot bear my mother's curse, I could not break the pledge which I swore\nafter Holy Communion! I could not commit so great a sin, Andor, not even\nfor your sake, for if I did remorse would break my heart, and all your\nlove for me would not compensate me for the sin.\"\n\nAnd before he could say another word, before his arms could once more\nclose round her or his trembling hands clutch at her fluttering\npetticoats, she was gone--vanished out of his grasp and into the\ndarkness, and only the patter of her little feet broke the silence of\nthe night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\"In any case Elsa is not for you.\"\n\n\nAndor with a sigh of heartbroken disappointment now turned to go into\nthe inn. He had the key in his hand which my lord the young count had\ngiven him with a careless laugh and a condescending nod of\nacknowledgment for the service thus rendered to him and to Klara.\n\nThe door of the tap-room was still wide open, a narrow wedge-shaped\nlight filtrated through on to the beams and floor of the verandah,\nmaking the surrounding blackness seem yet more impenetrable.\n\nAndor entered the tap-room and walked straight up to the centre table,\nand he placed the key upon the small tray which Klara had pointed out to\nhim. Then he turned and looked around him: Klara was not there, and the\nroom was quite deserted. Apparently the sleepers of awhile ago had been\nroused from their slumbers and had departed one by one. For a moment\nAndor paused, wondering if he should tell Klara that he had been\nsuccessful in his errand. He could hear the murmur of the girl's voice\nin the next room talking to her father.\n\nNo! On the whole he preferred not to meet her again: he didn't like the\nwoman, and still felt very wrathful against her for the impudent part\nshe had played at the feast this afternoon.\n\nHe had just made up his mind to go back to the presbytery where the kind\nPater had willingly given him a bed, when Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la's broad, squat\nfigure appeared in the open doorway. He had a lighted cigar between his\nteeth and his hands were buried in the pockets of his trousers; he held\nhis head on one side and his single eye leered across the room at the\nother man.\n\nWhen he encountered Andor's quick, savage glance he gave a loud, harsh\nlaugh.\n\n\"She gave it you straight enough, didn't she?\" he said as he swaggered\ninto the room.\n\n\"You were listening?\" asked Andor curtly.\n\n\"Yes. I was,\" replied B\u00c3\u00a9la. \"I was in here and I heard your voice, so I\nstole out on to the verandah. You were not ten paces away; I could hear\nevery word you said.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well what?\" sneered the other.\n\n\"What conclusion did you arrive at?\"\n\n\"What conclusion?\" retorted B\u00c3\u00a9la, with a laugh. \"Why, my good man, I\ncame to the conclusion that in spite of all your fine talk about God and\nso on, and all your fine airs of a gentleman from Australia, you are\nnothing but a low-down cur who comes sneaking round trying to steal a\nfellow's sweetheart from him.\"\n\n\"I suppose you are right there, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" said Andor, with a quick,\nimpatient sigh and with quite unwonted meekness. \"I suppose I am, as you\nsay, nothing but a low-down cur.\"\n\n\"Yes, my friend, that's just it,\" assented the other dryly; \"but she's\nlet you know pretty straight, hasn't she? that she wouldn't listen to\nyour talk. Elsa will stick by me, and by her promise to me, you may bet\nyour shirt on that. She is too shrewd to think of exchanging the\nsecurity of to-day for any of your vague promises. She is afraid of her\nmother and of me and of God's curses and so on, and she does not care\nenough about you to offend the lot of us, and that's about how it\nstands.\"\n\n\"You are right there, B\u00c3\u00a9la, that is about how it stands.\"\n\n\"And so, my fine gentleman,\" concluded B\u00c3\u00a9la, with a sneer, \"you cannot\nget rid of me unless you are ready to cut my throat and to hang for it\nafterwards. In any case, you see, Elsa is not for you.\"\n\nAndor said nothing for the moment. It seemed as if vaguely in his mind\nsome strong purpose had already taken birth and was struggling to\nsubjugate his will. His bronzed face marked clearly the workings of his\nthoughts: at first there had been a dulled, sombre look in his dark,\ndeep-set eyes; then gradually a flame seemed to flicker in them, feebly\nat first, then dying down for awhile, then rising again more triumphant,\nmore glowing than before, even as the firm lines around the\ntightly-closed lips became more set and more expressive of a strong\nresolve.\n\nIgn\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein's querulous voice was heard in the other room, giving\nfussy directions to his daughter about the collecting and packing up of\nhis things. Anon, he opened the door and peered out into the tap-room:\nhe had heard the confused murmur of footsteps and of voices, and\npossible customers must not be neglected even at an anxious moment of\ndeparture.\n\nSeeing B\u00c3\u00a9la and Andor there, he asked if anything was wanted.\n\n\"No, no,\" said B\u00c3\u00a9la impatiently, \"nothing more to-night. Andor and I are\ngoing directly.\"\n\nThe narrow hatchet-face once more disappeared behind the door. Klara's\nvoice was heard to ask:\n\n\"Who is in the tap-room, father?\"\n\n\"Andor and B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" replied the old man, \"but never you mind about the\ntap-room. Just see that you don't forget my red handkerchief, and my fur\ncap for the journey, and my bottle of .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHis mumblings became inaudible, and after awhile B\u00c3\u00a9la reiterated, with\nan airy laugh:\n\n\"No, my friend! Elsa is not for you.\"\n\nThen it was that Andor's confused thoughts shaped themselves into a\nresolve.\n\n\"Not unless you will give her up, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" he said slowly: \"you yourself,\nI mean--now--at this eleventh hour.\"\n\n\"I?\" queried the other harshly--not understanding. \"Give her up?\"\n\n\"Yes. Tell her that you have thought the whole matter over; that you\nhave realized that nothing but unhappiness can come from your union\ntogether. She would feel a little humiliated at first, perhaps, but she\nwould come to me, if you would let her go. I can deal with Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni\nafter that. If you will release Elsa yourself of her promise she would\ncome to me, I know.\"\n\nB\u00c3\u00a9la looked for awhile in silence at the earnest face of the other man,\nthen he burst into a loud, mocking laugh.\n\n\"You are mad,\" he said, \"or else drunk.\"\n\n\"I am neither,\" rejoined the other calmly. \"It is all perfectly feasible\nif only you will release Elsa. You have so often asserted that you don't\ncare one brass fill\u00c3\u00a9r for the opinion of village folk.\"\n\n\"And I don't.\"\n\n\"Then it cannot matter to you if some blame is cast on you for breaking\noff with Elsa on the eve of your wedding. People must see how unsuited\nyou are to each other and how unhappy your marriage must eventually turn\nout. You have no feeling about promises, you have no parents who might\ncurse you if you break them. Break your promise to Elsa now, B\u00c3\u00a9la, and\nyou will be doing the finest action of your life. Break your promise to\nher, man, and let her come to me.\"\n\nB\u00c3\u00a9la was still staring at Andor as if indeed he thought the other mad,\nbut now an evil leer gradually spread over his face and his one eye\nclosed until it looked like a mere slit through which he now darted on\nAndor a look of triumph and of hate.\n\n\"Break my promise to Elsa?\" he said slowly and deliberately. \"I wouldn't\ndo it, my good man, if you offered me all the gold in your precious\nAmerica.\"\n\n\"But you don't love her, B\u00c3\u00a9la,\" urged Andor, with ardent earnestness.\n\"You don't really want her.\"\n\n\"No, I don't,\" said the other roughly, \"but I don't want you to have her\neither.\"\n\n\"What can it matter to you? There are plenty of pretty girls this side\nof the Maros who would be only too glad to step into Elsa's shoes.\"\n\n\"I don't care about any pretty girls on this side of the Maros, nor on\nthe other either for that matter. I won't give Elsa up to you, my\nfriend, and she won't break her promise to me because she fears God and\nher mother's curse. See?\"\n\n\"She's far too good for you,\" cried Andor, with sudden vehemence, for he\nhad already realized that he must give up all hope now, and the other\nman's manner, his coarseness and callousness had irritated him beyond\nthe bounds of endurance. He hated this cruel, selfish brute who held\npower over Elsa with all the hatred of which his hot Magyar blood was\ncapable. A red mist seemed at times now to rise before his eyes, the\nkind of mist that obscures a man's brain and makes him do deeds which\nare recorded in hell.\n\n\"She's far too good for you,\" he reiterated hoarsely, even as his\npowerful fists clenched themselves in a violent effort to keep up some\nsemblance of self-control. The thought of Elsa still floated across his\nmental vision, of Elsa whose pure white hand seemed to dissipate that\nugly red mist with all the hideous thoughts which it brought in its\ntrail. \"You ought to treat her well, man,\" he cried in the agony of his\nsoul, \"you've got to treat her well.\"\n\nThe other looked him up and down like a man does an enemy whom he\nbelieves to be powerless to do him any harm. Then he said with a sneer\nthrough which, however, now there was apparent an undercurrent of\nboiling wrath:\n\n\"I'll treat her just as I choose, and you, my friend, had best in the\nfuture try to attend to your own business.\"\n\nBut Andor, obsessed by the one idea, feeling his own helplessness in the\nmatter, would not let the matter drop.\n\n\"How you can look at another woman,\" he said sombrely, \"while Elsa is\nnear you I cannot imagine.\"\n\nHe looked round him vaguely, as if he wanted all the dumb, inanimate\nthings around him to bear witness to this monstrous idea: Elsa flouted\nfor another woman! Elsa! the most beautiful woman on God's earth, the\npurest, the best--flouted! And for whom? for what?--other\ngirls--women--who were not worthy to walk in the same street as Elsa!\nThe thought made Andor giddy, his glance became more wandering, less\ncomprehending .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. that awful red mist was once more blurring his\nvision.\n\nAnd as he looked round him--ununderstanding and wretched--his glance\nfell upon the key which he himself had placed upon the brass tray a few\nmoments ago; and the key brought back to his mind the recollection of\nKlara the Jewess, her domination over B\u00c3\u00a9la, her triumph over Elsa, and\nalso the terrible plight in which she had found herself when she had\nbegged Andor for friendly help, and given him in exchange the solemn\npromise which he had exacted from her.\n\nThis recollection eased somewhat the heavy burden of his anxiety, and\nthere was quite a look of triumph in his eyes when he once more turned\nto B\u00c3\u00a9la.\n\n\"Well!\" he said, \"there's one thing certain, and that is that Elsa won't\nhave to suffer again from the insolence of that Jewess. I have cut the\nground from under your feet in that direction, my friend.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" retorted B\u00c3\u00a9la airily. \"How did you manage to do that?\"\n\n\"I rendered her a service this afternoon--she was in serious trouble and\nasked me to help her.\"\n\n\"Oh?--and may I ask the nature of the trouble--and of the service?\"\nsneered the other.\n\n\"Never mind about the nature of the service. I did help Klara in her\ntrouble, and in return she has given me a solemn promise to have nothing\nwhatever more to do with you.\"\n\n\"Oh! did she?\" cried B\u00c3\u00a9la, whose savage temper, held in check for\nawhile, had at last risen to its habitual stage of unbridled fury. All\nthe hot blood had rushed to his head, making his face crimson and his\neye glowing and unsteady, and his hand shook visibly as he leaned\nagainst the table so that the mugs and bottles rattled, as did the key\nupon the metal tray. He, too, felt that hideous red mist enveloping him\nand blurring his sight. He hated Andor with all his might, and would\nhave strangled him if he had felt that he had the physical power to do\nit as well as the moral strength. His voice came hoarse and hissing\nthrough his throat as he murmured through tightly clenched teeth:\n\n\"She did, did she? And you made her give you that promise which is not\ngoing to bind her, let me tell you that. But let me also tell you in\nthe meanwhile, my fine gentleman from America, that your d----d\ninterference will do no good to your former sweetheart, who is already\nas good as my wife--and will be my wife to-morrow. Klara Goldstein is my\nfriend, let me tell you that, and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHe paused a moment .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. something had arrested the words in his throat.\nAs so often occurs in the mysterious workings of Fate, a small,\napparently wholly insignificant event suddenly caused the full tide of\nhis destiny to turn--and not only of his own destiny but that of many\nothers!\n\nAn event--a tiny fact--trivial enough for the moment: the touch of his\nhand against the key upon the brass tray.\n\nMechanically he picked up the key: his mind was not yet working quite\nclearly, but the shifty glance of his one eye rested upon the key, and\ncontemplated it for awhile.\n\n\"Well!\" he murmured vaguely at last, \"how strange!\"\n\n\"What is strange?\" queried the other--not understanding.\n\n\"That this key should, so to speak, fall like this into my hand.\"\n\n\"That isn't strange at all,\" said Andor, with a shrug of the shoulders,\nfor now he thought that B\u00c3\u00a9la was drunk, so curious was the look in his\neye, \"considering that I put that key there myself half an hour ago--it\nis the key of the back door of this house.\"\n\n\"I know it is,\" rejoined B\u00c3\u00a9la slowly, \"I have had it in my possession\nbefore now .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. when Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein has been away from home, and it\nwas not thought prudent for me to enter this house by the front door\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. late at night--you understand.\"\n\nThen, as Andor once more shrugged his shoulders in contempt, but\nvouchsafed no further comment, he continued still more slowly and\ndeliberately:\n\n\"Isn't it strange that just as you were trying to interfere in my\naffairs, this key should, so to speak, fall into my hand. Fate plays\nsome funny little pranks sometimes, eh, Mr. Guardian Angel?\"\n\n\"What has Fate got to do with it?\" queried Andor roughly.\n\n\"You don't see it?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then perhaps you were not aware of the fact,\" said B\u00c3\u00a9la blandly, as he\ntoyed with the key, \"that papa Goldstein is going off to Kecskem\u00c3\u00a9t\nto-night.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Andor slowly, \"I did know that, but .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"But you didn't know, perhaps, that pretty Klara likes a little\njollification and a bit of fun sometimes, and that papa Goldstein is a\nvery strict parent and mightily particular about the proprieties. It is\na way those cursed Jews have, you know.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" said Andor again, \"I did know that too.\"\n\nHe was speaking in a curious, dazed kind of way now: he suddenly felt as\nif the whole world had ceased to be, and as if he was wandering quite\nalone in a land of dreams. Before him, far away, was that red misty\nveil, and on ahead he could dimly see B\u00c3\u00a9la, with a hideous grin on his\nface, brandishing that key, whilst somehow or other the face of Leopold\nHirsch, distorted with passion and with jealousy, appeared to beckon to\nhim from behind that distant crimson veil.\n\n\"Well, you see,\" continued B\u00c3\u00a9la, in the same suave and unctuous tones\nwhich he had suddenly assumed, \"since pretty Klara is fond of\njollification and a bit of fun, and her father is over-particular, why,\nthat's where this nice little key comes in. For presently papa will be\ngone and the house worthily and properly shut up, and the keys in papa\nGoldstein's pocket, who will be speeding off to Kecskem\u00c3\u00a9t; but with the\nhelp of this little key, which is a duplicate one, I--who am a great\nfriend of pretty Klara--can just slip into the house quietly for a\ncomfortable little supper and just a bit of fun; and no one need be any\nthe wiser, for I shall make no noise and the back door of this house is\nwell screened from prying eyes. Have you any further suggestion to make,\nmy fine gentleman from America?\"\n\n\"Only this, man,\" said Andor sombrely, \"that it is you who are mad--or\ndrunk.\"\n\n\"Oh! not mad. What harm is there in it? You chose to interfere between\nKlara and me, and I only want to show you that I am the master of my own\naffairs.\"\n\n\"But it'll get known. Old R\u00c3\u00a9zi's cottage is not far and she is a\nterrible gossip. Back door or no back door, someone will see you\nsneaking in or out.\"\n\n\"And if they do--have you any objection, my dear friend?\"\n\n\"It'll be all over the village--Elsa will hear of it.\"\n\n\"And if she does?\" retorted B\u00c3\u00a9la, with a sudden return to his savage\nmood. \"She will have to put up with it: that's all. She has already\nlearned to-day that I do as I choose to do, and that she must do as I\ntell her. But a further confirmation of this excellent lesson will not\ncome amiss--at the eleventh hour, my dear friend.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't do such a thing, B\u00c3\u00a9la! You wouldn't put such an insult on\nElsa! You wouldn't .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't what, my fine gentleman, who tried to sneak another fellow's\nsweetheart?\" sneered B\u00c3\u00a9la as he drew a step or two nearer to Andor. \"I\nwouldn't what? Come here and have supper with Klara while Elsa's\nprecious friends are eating the fare I've provided for them and abusing\nme behind my back? Yes, I would! and I'll stay just as long as I like\nand let anyone see me who likes .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and Elsa may go to the devil with\njealousy for aught I care.\"\n\nHe was quite close to Andor now, but being half a head shorter, he had\nto look up in order to see the other eye to eye. Thus for a moment the\ntwo men were silent, measuring one another like two primitive creatures\nof these plains who have been accustomed for generations past to satisfy\nall quarrels with the shedding of blood. And in truth, never had man so\ndesperate a longing to kill as Andor had at this moment. The red mist\nenveloped him entirely now, he could see nothing round him but the\nhideous face of this coarse brute with its one leering eye and cruel,\nsensuous lips.\n\nThe vision of Elsa had quite faded from before his gaze, her snow-white\nhands no longer tried to dissipate that hideous blood-red veil. Only\nfrom behind Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la's shoulder he saw peering at him through the mist\nthe pale eyes of Leopold Hirsch. But on them he would not look, for he\nfelt that that way lay madness.\n\nWhat the next moment would have brought the Fates who weave the\ndestinies of mankind could alone have told. B\u00c3\u00a9la, unconscious or\nindifferent to the menace which was glowing in Lakatos Andor's eyes,\nnever departed for a moment from his attitude of swaggering insolence,\nand even now with an ostentatious gesture he thrust the key into his\nwaistcoat pocket.\n\nAndor gave a hoarse and quickly-smothered cry like that of a beast about\nto spring:\n\n\"You cur!\" he muttered through his teeth, \"you d----d cur!\"\n\nHis hands were raised, ready to fasten themselves on the other man's\nthroat, when the door of the inner room was suddenly thrown open and\nIgn\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein's querulous voice broke the spell that hung over the\ntwo men.\n\n\"Now then, my friends, now then,\" he said fussily as he shuffled into\nthe room, \"it is time that this respectable house should be shut up for\nthe night. I am just off to catch the slow train to Kecskem\u00c3\u00a9t--after\nyou, my friends, after you, please.\"\n\nHe made a gesture toward the open door and then went up to the table and\npoured himself out a final stirrup-cup. He was wrapped from head to foot\nin a threadbare cloth coat, lined with shaggy fur, a fur-edged bonnet\nwas on his head, and he carried a stout stick to which was attached a\nlarge bundle done up in a red cotton handkerchief. This now he slung\nover his shoulder.\n\n\"Klara, my girl,\" he called.\n\n\"Yes, father,\" came Klara's voice from the inner room.\n\n\"I didn't see the back-door key--the duplicate one I mean--hanging in\nits usual place.\"\n\n\"No, father, I know,\" she replied. \"It's all right. I have it in my\npocket. I'll hang it up on the peg in a minute.\"\n\n\"Right, girl,\" he said as he smacked his lips after the long draft of\nwine. \"You are quite sure Leopold changed his mind about coming with\nme?\"\n\n\"Quite sure, father.\"\n\n\"I wonder, then, he didn't wait to say good-bye to me.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he'll meet you at the station.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he will. Now then, gentlemen,\" added the old Jew as he once\nmore turned to the two men.\n\nIndeed Andor felt that the spell had been lifted from him. He was quite\ncalm now, and that feeling of being in dreamland had descended still\nmore forcibly upon his mind.\n\n\"You have nothing more to say to me, have you, my good Andor?\" said\nB\u00c3\u00a9la, with a final look of insolent swagger directed at his rival.\n\n\"No,\" replied Andor slowly and deliberately. \"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Then good-night, my friend!\" concluded the other, with a sarcastic\nlaugh. \"Why not go to the barn, and dance with Elsa, and sup at my\nexpense like the others do? You'll be made royally welcome there, I\nassure you.\"\n\n\"Thank you. I am going home.\"\n\n\"Well! as you like! I shall just look in there myself now for half an\nhour--but I am engaged later on for supper elsewhere, you know.\"\n\n\"So I understand!\"\n\n\"Gentlemen! My dear friends! I shall miss my train!\" pleaded old Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz\nGoldstein querulously.\n\nHe manoeuvred the two men toward the door and then prepared to follow\nthem.\n\n\"Klara!\" he called again.\n\n\"Coming, father,\" she replied.\n\nShe came running out of the room, and as she reached the door she called\nto Andor.\n\n\"Andor, you have not said good-night,\" she said significantly.\n\n\"Never mind about that now,\" said Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein fretfully, \"I shall\nmiss my train.\"\n\nHe kissed his daughter perfunctorily, then said:\n\n\"There's no one in the tap-room now, is there? I didn't notice.\"\n\n\"No,\" she replied, \"no one just now.\"\n\n\"Then I'd keep the door shut, if I were you. I'd rather those fellows\nback from Arad didn't come in to-night. The open door would attract\nthem--a closed one might have the effect of speeding them on their way.\"\n\n\"Very well, father,\" she said indifferently, \"I'll keep the door\nclosed.\"\n\n\"And mind you push all the bolts home to both the doors,\" he added\nsternly. \"A girl alone in a house cannot be too careful.\"\n\n\"All right, father,\" she rejoined impatiently, \"I'll see to everything.\nHaven't I been alone like this before?\"\n\nThe other two men were going down the verandah steps. Goldstein went out\ntoo now and slammed the door behind him.\n\nAnd Klara found herself alone in the house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\"What had Andor done?\"\n\n\nShe waited for a moment with her ear glued to the front door until the\nlast echo of the men's footsteps had completely died away in the\ndistance, then she ran to the table. The tray was there, but no key upon\nit. With feverish, jerky movements she began to hunt for it, pushing\naside bottles and mugs, opening drawers, searching wildly with dilated\neyes all round the room.\n\nThe key was here, somewhere .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. surely, surely Andor had not played\nher false .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. he would not play her false .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. He was not that sort\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. surely, surely he was not that sort. He had come back from his\nerrand--of course she had seen him just now, and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and he had said\nnothing certainly, but .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\n\nWell! He can't have gone far; and her father wouldn't hear if she\ncalled. She ran back to the door and fumbled at the latch, for her hands\ntrembled so that she bruised them against the iron. There! At last it\nwas done! She opened the door and peered out into the night. Everything\nwas still, not a footstep echoed from down the street. She took one step\nout, on to the verandah .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. then she heard a rustle from behind the\npollarded acacia tree and a rustle amongst its leaves. Someone was\nthere!--on the watch!--Leopold!\n\nShe smothered a scream of terror and in a moment had fled back into the\nroom and slammed and bolted the door behind her. Now she stood with her\nback against it, arms outstretched, fingers twitching convulsively\nagainst the wood. She was shivering as with cold, though the heat in the\nroom was close and heavy with fumes of wine and tobacco: her teeth were\nchattering, a cold perspiration had damped the roots of her hair.\n\nShe had wanted to call Andor back, just to ask him definitely if he had\nbeen successful in his errand and what he had done with the key. Perhaps\nhe meant to tell her; perhaps he had merely forgotten to put the key on\nthe tray, and still had it in his waistcoat pocket; she had been a fool\nnot to come out and speak to him when she heard his voice in the\ntap-room awhile ago. She had wanted to, but her father monopolized her\nabout his things for the journey. He had been exceptionally querulous\nto-night and was always ready to be suspicious; also B\u00c3\u00a9la had been in\nthe tap-room with Andor, and she wouldn't have liked to speak of the key\nbefore B\u00c3\u00a9la. What she had been absolutely sure of, however, until now\nwas that Andor would not have come back and then gone away like this, if\nhe had not succeeded in his errand and got her the key from Count Feri.\n\nBut the key was not there: there was no getting away from that, and she\nhad wanted to call Andor back and to ask him about it--and had found\nLeopold Hirsch standing out there in the dark .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. watching.\n\nShe had not seen him--but she had felt his presence--and she was quite\nsure that she had heard the hissing sound of his indrawn breath and the\nmovement which he had made to spring on her--and strangle her, as he had\nthreatened to do--if she went out by the front door.\n\nMechanically she passed her hand across her throat. Terror--appalling,\ndeadly terror of her life--had her in its grasp. She tottered across\nthe room and sank into a chair. She wanted time to think.\n\nWhat had Andor done? What a fool she had been not to ask him the\nstraight question while she had the chance. She had been afraid of\nlittle things--her father's temper, Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la's sneers--when now there\nwas death and murder to fear.\n\nWhat had Andor done?\n\nHad he played her false? Played this dirty trick on her out of revenge?\nHe certainly--now she came to think of it--had avoided meeting her\nglance when he went away just now.\n\nHad he played her false?\n\nThe more she thought on it, the more the idea got root-hold in her\nbrain. In order to be revenged for the humiliation which she had helped\nto put upon Elsa, Andor had chosen this means for bringing her to\neverlasting shame and sorrow--the young Count murdered outside her door,\nin the act of sneaking into the house by a back way, at dead of night,\nwhile Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein was from home; Leopold Hirsch--her tokened\nfianc\u00c3\u00a9--a murderer, condemned to hang for a brutal crime; she disgraced\nfor ever, cursed if not killed by her father, who did not trifle in the\nmatter of his daughter's good name. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. All that was Andor's projected\nrevenge for what she had done to Elsa.\n\nThe thought of it was too horrible. It beat into her brain until she\nfelt that her head must burst as under the blows of a sledge-hammer or\nelse that she must go mad.\n\nShe pushed back the matted hair from her temples, and looked round the\ntiny, dark, lonely room in abject terror. From far away came the shrill\nwhistle of the engine which bore her father away to Kecskem\u00c3\u00a9t. It must\nbe nearly half-past nine, then, and close on half an hour since she had\nbeen left here alone with her terrors. Yet another half-hour and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\n\nNo, no! This she felt that she could not endure--not another half-hour\nof this awful, death-dealing suspense. Anything would be better than\nthat--death at Leopold's hands--a quick gasp, a final agony--yes! That\nwould be briefer and better--and perhaps Leo's heart would misgive\nhim--perhaps .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but in any case, anything _must_ be better than this\nsuspense.\n\nShe struggled to her feet; her knees shook under her: for the moment she\ncould not have moved if her very life had depended on it. So she stood\nstill, propped against the table, her hands clutching convulsively at\nits edge for support, and her eyes dilated and staring, still searching\nround the room wildly for the key.\n\nAt last she felt that she could walk; she tottered back across the room,\nback to the door, and her twitching fingers were once more fumbling with\nthe bolts.\n\nThe house was so still and the air was so oppressive. When she paused in\nher fumbling--since her fingers refused her service--she could almost\nhear that movement again behind the acacia tree outside, and that\nrustling among the leaves.\n\nShe gave a wild gasp of terror and ran back to the chair--like a\nfrightened feline creature, swift and silent--and sank into it, still\ngasping, her whole body shaken now as with fever, her teeth chattering,\nher limbs numb.\n\nDeath had been so near! She had felt an icy breath across her throat!\nShe was frightened--hideously, abjectly, miserably frightened. Death\nlurked for her, there outside in the dark, from behind the acacia tree!\nDeath in the guise of a jealous madman, whose hate had been whetted by\nan hour's lonely watch in the dark--lonely, but for his thoughts.\n\nTears of self-pity as well as of fear rose to the unfortunate girl's\neyes; convulsive sobs shook her shoulders and tore at her heart till she\nfelt that she must choke. She threw out her arms across the table and\nburied her face in them and lay there, sobbing and moaning in her terror\nand in her misery.\n\nHow long she remained thus, crying and half inert with mental anguish\nand pain, she could not afterwards have told. Nor did she know what it\nwas that roused her from this torpor, and caused her suddenly to sit up\nin her chair, upright, wide-awake, her every sense on the alert.\n\nSurely she could not have heard the fall of footsteps at the back of the\nhouse! There was the whole width of the inner room and two closed doors\nbetween her and the yard at the back, and the ground there was soft and\nmuddy; no footstep, however firm, could raise echoes there.\n\nAnd yet she had heard! Of that she felt quite sure, heard with that\nsixth sense of which she, in her ignorance, knew nothing, but which,\nnevertheless, now had roused her from that coma-like state into which\nterror had thrown her, and set every one of her nerves tingling once\nmore and pulsating with life and the power to feel.\n\nFor the moment all her faculties seemed merged into that of hearing.\nWith that same sixth sense she heard the stealthy footsteps coming\nnearer and nearer. They had not approached from the village, but from\nthe fields at the back, and along the little path which led through the\nunfenced yard straight to the back door.\n\nThese footsteps--which seemed like the footsteps of ghosts, so\nintangible were they--were now so near that to Klara's supersensitive\nmind they appeared to be less than ten paces from the back door.\n\nThen she heard another footstep--she heard it quite distinctly, even\nthough walls and doors were between her and them--she heard the movement\nfrom behind the acacia tree--the one that stands at the corner of the\nhouse, in full view of both the doors--she heard the rustle among its\nlow-hanging branches and that hissing sound as of an indrawn breath.\n\nShe shot up from her chair like an automaton--rigid and upright, her\nmouth opened as for a wild shriek, but all power of sound was choked in\nher throat. She ran into the inner room like one possessed, her mouth\nstill wide open for the frantic shriek which would not come, for that\nagonizing call for help.\n\nShe fell up against the back door. Her hands tore at the lock, at the\nwoodwork, at the plaster around; she bruised her hands and cut her\nfingers to the bone, but still that call would not come to her\nthroat--not even now, when she heard on the other side of the door, less\nthan five paces from where she lay, frantic with horror, a groan, a\nsmothered cry, a thud--then swiftly hurrying footsteps flying away in\nthe night.\n\nThen nothing more, for she was lying now in a huddled mass, half\nunconscious on the floor.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\"The shadow that fell from the tall sunflowers.\"\n\n\nHow Klara Goldstein spent that terrible night she never fully realized.\nAfter half an hour or so she dragged herself up from the floor. Full\nconsciousness had returned to her, and with it the power to feel, to\nunderstand and to fear.\n\nA hideous, awful terror was upon her which seemed to freeze her through\nand through; a cold sweat broke out all over her body, and she was\ntrembling from head to foot. She crawled as far as the narrow little bed\nwhich was in a corner of the room, and just managed to throw herself\nupon it, on her back, and there to remain inert, perished with cold,\nracked with shivers, her eyes staring upwards into the darkness, her\nears strained to listen to every sound that came from the other side of\nthe door.\n\nBut gradually, as she lay, her senses became more alive; the power to\nthink coherently, to reason with her fears, asserted itself more and\nmore over those insane terrors which had paralysed her will and her\nheart. She did begin to think--not only of herself and of her miserable\nposition, but of the man who lay outside--dying or dead.\n\nYes! That soon became the most insistent thought.\n\nLeopold Hirsch, having done the awful deed, had fled, of course, but his\nvictim might not be dead, he might be only wounded and dying for want of\nsuccour. Klara--closing her eyes--could almost picture him, groaning\nand perhaps trying to drag himself up in a vain endeavour to get help.\n\nThen she rose--wretched, broken, terrified--but nevertheless resolved to\nput all selfish fears aside and to ascertain the full extent of the\ntragedy which had been enacted outside her door. She lit the\nstorm-lantern, then, with it in her hand, she went through the tap-room\nand opened the front door.\n\nShe knew well the risks which she was running, going out like this into\nthe night, and alone. Any passer-by might see her--ask questions,\nsuspect her of connivance when she told what it was that she had come\nout to seek in the darkness behind her own back door. But to this\nknowledge and this small additional fear she resolutely closed her mind.\nDrawing the door to behind her, she stepped out on to the verandah and\nthence down the few steps into the road below.\n\nA slight breeze had sprung up within the last half-hour, and had\nsucceeded in chasing away the heavy banks of cloud which had hung over\nthe sky earlier in the evening.\n\nEven as Klara paused at the foot of the verandah steps in order to\nsteady herself on her feet, the last filmy veil that hid the face of the\nmoon glided ethereally by. The moon was on the wane, golden and\nmysterious, and now, as she appeared high in the heaven, surrounded by a\nhalo of prismatic light, she threw a cold radiance on everything around,\npicking out every tree and cottage with unfailing sharpness and casting\nblack, impenetrable shadows which made the light, by contrast, appear\nyet more vivid and more clear.\n\nAll around leaves and branches rustled with a soft, swishing sound, like\nthe whisperings of ghosts, and from the plains beyond came that\nlong-drawn-out murmur of myriads of plume-crowned maize as they bent in\nrecurring unison to the caress of the wind.\n\nKlara's eyes peered anxiously round. Quickly she extinguished her\nlantern, and then remained for a while clinging to the wooden balusters\nof the verandah, eyes and ears on the alert like a hunted beast. Two\nbelated csik\u00c3\u00b3s[7] from a neighbouring village were passing down the main\nroad, singing at the top of their voices, their spurred boots clinking\nas they walked. Klara did not move till the murmur of the voices and the\nclinking of metal had died away and no other sound of human creature\nmoving or breathing close by broke the slumbering echoes of the village.\n\n[Footnote 7: Herdsmen in charge of foals.]\n\nOnly in the barn, far away, people were singing and laughing and making\nmerry. Klara could hear the gipsy band, the scraping of the fiddles and\nbanging of the czimbalom, followed now and then by one of those\noutbursts of jollity, of clapping of mugs on wooden tables, of banging\nof feet and shouts of laughter which characterize all festive gatherings\nin Hungary.\n\nCautiously now Klara began to creep along the low wall which supported\nthe balustrade. Her feet made no noise in the soft, sandy earth, her\nskirts clung closely to her limbs; at every minute sound she started and\npaused, clinging yet closer to the shadow which enveloped her.\n\nNow she came to the corner. There, just in front of her was the\npollarded acacia, behind which the murderer had cowered for an hour--on\nthe watch. The slowly withering leaves trembled in the breeze and their\nsoughing sounded eerie in the night, like the sighs of a departing soul.\n\nFurther on, some twenty paces away, was old R\u00c3\u00a9zi's cottage. All was dark\nand still in and around it. Klara had just a sufficient power of\nconsciousness left to note this fact with an involuntary little sigh of\nrelief. The murderer had done his work quickly and silently; his victim\nhad uttered no cry that would rouse the old gossip from her sleep.\n\nWhen Klara at last rounded the second corner of the house and came in\nfull view of the unfenced yard in the rear, she saw that it was flooded\nwith moonlight. For a moment she closed her eyes, for already she had\nperceived that a dark and compact mass lay on the ground within a few\nfeet of the back door. She wanted strength of purpose and a mighty\nappeal to her will before she would dare to look again. When she\nreopened her eyes, she saw that the mass lay absolutely still. She crept\nforward with trembling limbs and knees that threatened to give way under\nher at every moment.\n\nNow she no longer thought of herself; there was but little fear of\nanyone passing by this way and seeing her as she gradually crawled\nnearer and nearer to that inert mass which lay there on the ground so\nrigid and silent. Beyond the yard there were only maize-fields, and a\ntall row of sunflowers closed the place in as with a wall. And not a\nsound came from old R\u00c3\u00a9zi's cottage.\n\nKlara was quite close to that dark and inert thing at last; she put out\nher hand and touched it. The man was lying on his face; just as he had\nfallen, no doubt; with a superhuman effort she gathered up all her\nstrength and lifted those hunched-up shoulders from the ground. Then she\ngave a smothered cry; the pallid face of Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la was staring\nsightlessly up at the moon.\n\nIndeed, for the moment the poor girl felt as if she must go mad, as if\nfor ever and ever after this--waking or sleeping--she would see those\nglassy eyes, the drooping jaw, that horrible stain which darkened the\nthroat and breast. For a few seconds, which to her seemed an eternity,\nshe remained here, crouching beside the dead body of this unfortunate\nman, trying in vain in her confused mind to conjecture what had brought\nB\u00c3\u00a9la here, instead of the young Count, within the reach of Leopold's\nmaniacal jealousy and revenge.\n\nBut her brain was too numbed for reasoning and for coherent thought. She\nhad but to accept the facts as they were: that Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la lay here--dead,\nthat Leopold had murdered him, and that she must save herself at all\ncosts from being implicated in this awful, awful crime!\n\nAt last she contrived to gather up a sufficiency of strength--both\nmental and physical--to turn her back upon this terrible scene. She had\nstruggled up to her feet and was turning to go when her foot knocked\nagainst something hard, and as--quite mechanically--her eyes searched\nthe ground to see what this something was, she saw that it was the key\nof the back door, which had evidently escaped from the dead man's hand\nas he fell.\n\nTo stoop for it and pick it up--to run for the back door, which was so\nclose by--to unlock and open it and then to slip through it into the\nhouse was but the work of a few seconds--and now here she was once again\nin her room, like the hunted beast back in its lair--panting, quivering,\nready to fall--but safe, at all events.\n\nNo one had seen her, of that she felt sure. And now she knew--or thought\nshe knew--exactly what had happened. Lakatos Andor had been to the\ncastle; he had seen my lord and got the key away from him. He wanted to\ningratiate himself with my lord and to be able to boast in the future\nthat he had saved my lord's life, but evidently he did mean to have his\nrevenge not only on herself--Klara--but also on Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la for the\nhumiliation which they had put upon Elsa. It was a cruel and a dastardly\ntrick of revenge, and in her heart Klara had vague hopes already of\ngetting even with Andor one day. But that would come by and by--at some\nfuture time--when all this terrible tragedy would have been forgotten.\n\nFor the present she must once more think of herself. The key was now a\nprecious possession. She went to hang it up on its accustomed peg. Even\nLeopold--if he stayed in the village to brazen the whole thing\nout--could not prove anything with regard to that key. Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la might\nhave been a casual passer-by, strolling about among the maize-fields,\nnot necessarily intent on visiting Klara at dead of night. The key was\nnow safely on its peg; who would dare swear that Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la or anyone\nelse ever had it in his possession?\n\nIn fact, the secret rested between five people, of which she--Klara--was\none and the dead man another. Well, the latter could tell no tales, and\nshe, of course, would say nothing. Already she had determined--even\nthough her mind was still confused and her faculties still numb--that\nignorance would be the safest stronghold behind which she could entrench\nherself.\n\nThere remained Leo himself, the young Count, and, of course, Andor.\nWhich of these three would she have the greatest cause to fear?\n\nThere was Leo mad with jealousy, the young Count indifferent, and Andor\nwith curious and tortuous motives in his heart which surely he would not\nwish to disclose.\n\nShe had a sufficiency of presence of mind to go out and fetch the\nstorm-lantern from where she had left it at the foot of the verandah\nsteps. A passer-by who saw her in the act wished her a merry good-night,\nto which she responded in a steady voice. Then she carefully locked the\nfront door, and finally undressed and went to bed. There was no knowing\nwhether some belated wayfarer might not presently come on the dead man\nlying there in the yard: and having roused the neighbours, the latter\nmight think of calling on Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein for spirit or what not. It\nwas not generally known that Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein was from home, and if\npeople thumped loudly and long at her door, she must appear as if she\nhad just been roused from peaceful sleep.\n\nShe felt much more calm and fully alive, above all, to her own danger.\nThat kind of superstitious, unreasoning terror which had assailed her\nawhile ago had almost entirely left her. She seemed more composed, more\nsure of herself, now that she had been out in the yard and seen the\nwhole _mise en sc\u00c3\u00a8ne_ of the tragedy, which before that she had only\nvaguely imagined.\n\nBut what she felt that she could not do was to lie here alone in the\ndark, with only the silvery light of the moon creeping in weirdly\nthrough the dulled panes of the tiny window. So she picked up her black\nskirt, and stuffed it into the narrow window embrasure, until not a ray\nof light from within could be seen to peep through on the other side.\nShe had placed the storm-lantern in the corner, and this she left\nalight. It threw a feeble, yellowish glimmer round the room; after a few\nmoments, when her eyes were accustomed to this semi-gloom, she found\nthat she could see every familiar object quite distinctly; even the\nshadows did not seem impenetrable, nor could ghosts lurk in the unseen\nportions of the tiny room.\n\nOf course there was no hope of sleep--Klara knew well the moment that\nshe looked on the dead man's face, that she would always see it before\nher--to the end of her days. She saw it now, quite distinctly--especially\nwhen she closed her eyes; the moonlit yard, the shadow that fell from\nthe tall sunflowers, and the huddled, dark mass on the ground, with the\nturned-up face and the sightless eyes. But she was not afraid; she only\nfelt bitterly resentful against Andor, who, she firmly believed, had\nplayed her an odious trick.\n\nShe almost felt sorry for Leopold, who had only sinned because of his\ngreat love for her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\"We shall hear of another tragedy by and by.\"\n\n\nAnd so in Marosfalva there was no wedding on the festival day of S.\nMichael and All Angels; instead of that, on the day following, there was\na solemn Mass for the dead in the small village church, which was full\nto overflowing on that great occasion.\n\nEr\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la had been found--out in the open--murdered by an unknown hand.\nFeh\u00c3\u00a9r K\u00c3\u00a1roly and his brother, who lived down the Fekete Road, had taken\na cut across the last maize-field--the one situated immediately behind\nthe inn kept by Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein, and they had come across B\u00c3\u00a9la's body,\nlying in the yard, with face upturned and eyes staring up sightlessly at\nthe brilliant blue sky overhead.\n\nIt was then close on eight o'clock in the morning. The dancing in the\nbarn had been kept up till then, even though the two most important\npersonages of the festive gathering were not there to join in the fun.\n\nThe bridegroom had not been seen since his brief appearance an hour or\ntwo before supper, and Elsa had only just sat through the meal, trying\nto seem cheerful, but obviously hardly able to restrain her tears. After\nsupper, when her partner sought her for the cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s, she was nowhere to\nbe found. Kapus Irma--appealed to--said that the girl was fussy and full\nof nerves--for all the world like a born lady. She certainly wasn't very\nwell, had complained of headache, and been allowed by her mother to go\nhome quietly and turn into bed.\n\n\"She has another two jolly days to look forward to,\" Irma n\u00c3\u00a9ni had added\ncomplacently. \"Perhaps it is as well that she should get some rest\nto-night.\"\n\nAh, well! it was a queer wedding, and no mistake! The queerest that had\never been in Marosfalva within memory of man. A bride more prone to\ntears than to laughter! A bridegroom surly, discontented, and paying\nmarked attentions to the low-down Jewess over at the inn under his\nfuture wife's very nose!\n\nIt was quite one thing for a man to assert his own independence, and to\nshow his bride at the outset on whose feet the highest-heeled boots\nwould be, but quite another to flout the customs of the countryside and\nall its proprieties.\n\nWhen, after supper, good and abundant wine had loosened all tongues,\nadverse comments on the absent bridegroom flowed pretty freely. This\nshould have been the merriest time of the evening--the merriest time, in\nfact, of all the three festive days--the time when one was allowed to\nchaff the bride and to make her blush, to slap the lucky bridegroom on\nthe back and generally to allow full play to that exuberance of spirits\nwhich is always bubbling up to the surface out of a Magyar peasant's\nheart.\n\nNo doubt that B\u00c3\u00a9la's conduct had upset Elsa and generally cast a gloom\nover the festive evening. But the young people were not on that account\ngoing to be done out of their dancing; the older ones might sit round\nand gossip and throw up their hands and sigh, but that was no reason why\nthe gipsies should play a melancholy dirge.\n\nA cs\u00c3\u00a1rd\u00c3\u00a1s it must be, and of the liveliest! And after that another and\nyet another. Would it not be an awful pity to waste Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la's money,\neven though he was not here to enjoy its fruits? So dancing was kept up\ntill close on eight o'clock in the morning--till the sun was high up in\nthe heavens and the bell of the village church tolled for early Mass.\nUntil then the gipsies scraped their fiddles and banged their czimbalom\nalmost uninterruptedly; hundreds of sad and gay folk-songs were sung in\nchorus in the intervals of dancing the national dance. Cotton petticoats\nof many hues fluttered, leather boots--both red and black--clinked and\nstamped until the morning.\n\nThen it was that the merry company at last broke up, and that Feh\u00c3\u00a9r\nK\u00c3\u00a1roly and his brother took the short cut behind the inn, and found the\nbridegroom--at whose expense they had just danced and feasted--lying\nstark and stiff under the clear September sun.\n\nThey informed the mayor, who at once put himself in communication with\nthe gendarmerie of Arad: but long before the police came, the news of\nthe terrible discovery was all over the village, and there was no\nthought of sleep or rest after that.\n\nWorried to death, perspiring and puzzled, the police officers hastily\nsent down from Arad had vainly tried to make head or tail of the mass of\nconflicting accounts which were poured into their ears in a continuous\nstream of loud-voiced chatter for hours at a stretch: and God only knows\nwhat judicial blunders might have been committed before the culprit was\nfinally brought to punishment if the latter had not, once for all,\nhimself delivered over the key of the mystery.\n\nLeopold Hirsch had hanged himself to one of the beams in his own back\nshop. His assistant found him there--dead--later in the day.\n\nAs--by previous arrangement--the whole village was likely to be at Elsa\nKapus' wedding, there would not have been much use in keeping the shop\nopen. So the assistant had been given a holiday, but he came to the\nshop toward midday, when the whole village was full of the terrible news\nand half the population out in the street gossiping and commenting on\nit--marvelling why his employer had not yet been seen outside his doors.\n\nThe discovery--which the assistant at once communicated to the\npolice--solved the riddle of Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la's death. With a sigh of relief\nthe police officers adjourned from the mayor's parlour, where they had\nbeen holding their preliminary inquiries, to the castle, where it was\ntheir duty to report the occurrence to my lord the Count.\n\nAt the castle of course everyone was greatly surprised: the noble\nCountess raised her aristocratic eyebrows and declared her abhorrence of\nhearing of these horrors. The Count took the opportunity of cursing the\npeasantry for a quarrelsome, worrying lot, and offered the police\nofficers a snack and a glass of wine. He was hardly sorry for the loss\nof his bailiff, as Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la had been rather tiresome of late--bumptious\nand none too sober--and his lordship anyhow had resolved to dispense\nwith his services after he was married. So the death really caused him\nvery little inconvenience.\n\nYoung Count Feri knew nothing, of course. He was not likely to allow\nhimself or his name to be mixed up with a village scandal: he shuddered\nonce or twice when the thought flashed through his mind how narrowly he\nhad escaped Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la's fate, and to his credit be it said he had every\nintention of showing Lakatos Andor--who undoubtedly had saved his life\nby giving him timely warning--a substantial meed of gratitude.\n\nOf Klara Goldstein little or nothing was seen or heard. The police\nofficers had certainly gone to the inn in the course of the morning and\nhad stayed there close on half an hour: but as no one had been allowed\nto go into the tap-room during that time, the occurrences there remained\na matter of conjecture. After the officers went away Klara locked the\nfront door after them and remained practically shut up in the house,\nonly going in the evening as far as the post, but refusing to speak to\nanyone and going past with head erect and a proud, careless air which\ndeceived no one.\n\n\"She'll sing her tune in a minor key by and by, when Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein\ncomes home,\" said the gossips complacently.\n\n\"Those Jews are mighty hard on their daughters,\" commented the older\nfolk, \"if any scandal falls upon them. Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz is a hard man and\nover-ready with his stick.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't be surprised,\" was the universal conclusion, \"if we should\nhear of another tragedy by and by.\"\n\n\"In any case, Klara can't stay in the village,\" decided the bevy of\nyoung girls who talked the matter over among themselves, and were none\ntoo sorry that the smart, handsome Jewess--who had such a way with the\nmen--should be comfortably out of the way.\n\nBut everyone went to the Mass for the dead on the day following that\nwhich should have been such a merry wedding feast; and everyone joined\nin the Requiem and prayed fervently for the repose of the soul of the\nmurdered man.\n\nHe lay in state in the centre of the aisle, with four tall candles at\neach corner of the draped catafalque; a few bunches of white and purple\nasters clumsily tied together by inexperienced hands were laid upon the\ncoffin.\n\nPater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius preached a beautiful sermon about the swift and\nunexpected approach of Death when he is least expected. He also said\nsome very nice things about the dead man, and there was hardly a dry\neye in the church while he spoke.\n\nIn the remote corner of a pew, squeezed between a pillar and her mother,\nElsa knelt and prayed. Those who watched her--and there were\nmany--declared that not only did she never stop crying for a moment\nduring Mass, but that her eyes were swollen and her cheeks puffy from\nhaving cried all the night and all the day before.\n\nAfter Mass she must have slipped out by the little door which gave on\nthe presbytery garden. It was quite close to the pillar against which\nshe had been leaning, and no doubt the Pater had given her permission to\ngo out that way. From the presbytery garden she could skirt the fields\nand round the top of the village, and thus get home and give all her\nfriends the slip.\n\nThis, no doubt, she had done, for no one saw her the whole of that day,\nnor the next, which was the day of the funeral, and an occasion of\nwonderful pomp and ceremony. B\u00c3\u00a9la's brother had arrived in the meanwhile\nfrom Arad, where he was the manager of an important grain store, and he\nit was who gave all directions and all the money necessary that his\nbrother should have obsequies befitting his rank and wealth.\n\nThe church was beautifully decorated: there were huge bunches of white\nflowers upon the altar, and eight village lads carried the dead man to\nhis last resting-place; and no less than thirty Masses were ordered to\nbe said within the next year for the repose of the soul of one who in\nlife had enjoyed so much prosperity and consideration.\n\nAnd in the tiny graveyard situated among the maize-fields to the north\nof Marosfalva, and which is the local Jewish burial ground, the suicide\nwas quietly laid to rest. There was no religious service, for there was\nno minister of his religion present; an undertaker came down from Arad\nand saw to it all; there was no concourse of people, no singing, no\nflowers. Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein--home the day before from Kecskem\u00c3\u00a9t--alone\nfollowed the plain deal coffin on its lonely journey from the village to\nthe field.\n\nIt was the shop assistant who had seen to it all. He had gone up to Arad\nand seen a married sister of his late master's--Sara Rosen, whose\nhusband kept a second-hand clothes shop there, and who gave full\ninstructions to an undertaker whilst declaring herself unable--owing to\ndelicate health--to attend the funeral herself.\n\nThe undertaker had provided a cart and a couple of oxen and two men to\nlift the coffin in and out. They came late on the Thursday evening, at\nabout eight o'clock, and drew up at the back of the late Leopold\nHirsch's shop. No one was about and the night was dark.\n\nSlowly the cart, creaking on its wheels and axles, wound its way through\nsome maize stubble, up a soft, sandy road to the enclosed little bit of\nground which the local Jews have reserved for themselves.\n\nAnd the mysterious veil which divides the present from the past fell\nquickly over this act of the village tragedy, as it had done with pomp\nand circumstance after the banquet which followed the laying to rest of\nthe murdered man.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\"Some day.\"\n\n\nA week went by after the funeral before Elsa saw Andor again. She had\nnot purposely avoided him, any more than she had avoided everyone else:\nbut unlike most girls of her class and of her nationality she had felt a\ngreat desire to be alone during the most acute period of this life's\ncrisis through which she was passing just now.\n\nAt first on that never-to-be-forgotten morning when she woke to her\nwedding-day--her white veil and wreath of artificial white roses lying\nconspicuously on the top of the chest of drawers, so that her eyes were\nbound to alight on them the moment they opened--and saw her mother\nstanding beside her bed, dishevelled, pale, and obviously labouring\nunder some terrible excitement, she had been conscious as of an awful\nblow on the head, a physical sensation of numbness and of pain.\n\nEven before she had had time to formulate a question she knew that some\nterrible calamity had occurred. In jerky phrases, broken by moans and\ninterjections, the mother had blurted out the news: Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la was\ndead--he had been found just now--murdered outside Klara Goldstein's\ndoor--there would be no wedding--Elsa was a widow before she had been a\nbride. Half the village was inclined to believe that Ign\u00c3\u00a1cz Goldstein\nhad done the deed in a moment of angry passion, finding B\u00c3\u00a9la sneaking\nround his daughter's door when he himself was going away from\nhome--others boldly accused Andor.\n\nElsa had said nothing at the time. That same imagined blow on the head\nhad also deprived her of the power of speech. Fortunately Irma talked so\nloudly and so long that she paid no attention to her daughter's silence,\nand presently ran out into the village to gather more news.\n\nAnd Elsa remained alone in the house, save for the helpless invalid in\nthe next room. She washed and dressed herself quickly and mechanically,\nthen sat down on her favourite low chair, close beside her crippled\nfather's knee, cowering there like some little field mouse, attentive,\nalert, rigidly still, for very fear of what was to come.\n\nIrma did not come back for two or three hours: when she did it was to\nbring the exciting news that Leopold Hirsch had been found hanging to a\nbeam in his back shop, with the knife wherewith he had killed Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la\nlying conspicuously on a table close by.\n\nElsa felt as if the weight of the world had been lifted from off her\nbrain. All through these hours the thought of Andor having committed\nsuch an abominable crime never once entered her mind, but nevertheless\nwhen her mother told the news about Leopold Hirsch, and that the police\nofficers had already left the village, she was conscious of an\noverwhelming sense of relief.\n\nFortunately her mother was busy all day gossiping with her cronies and\nElsa was allowed the luxury of sitting alone most of the day, silent and\nabsorbed, doing the usual work of the house in the morning and in the\nafternoon busying herself with carefully putting away the wedding dress,\nthe veil, the wreath which would not be wanted now.\n\nLate in the evening, when there was a chance of finding the street\ndeserted, she ran out as far as the presbytery. Fortunately the night\nwas dark: a thin drizzle was falling, and it spread a misty veil all\ndown the village street. Elsa had tied one of her mother's dark-coloured\nhandkerchiefs over her head and put her darkest-coloured petticoat on\nthe top of all the others. She had also wrapped her mother's dark shawl\nround her shoulders, and thus muffled up she was able to flit\nunperceived down the street, a swift little dark figure\nundistinguishable from the surrounding darkness of the night.\n\nFortunately the Pater was at home and ready to see her. She heaved a\nsigh of relief as she entered the bare narrow little hall which led on\nthe right to the Pater's parlour.\n\nShe had been able to tell Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius exactly what was troubling\nher--that sense of peace, almost of relief, which had descended into her\nsoul when she heard that she never, never need be Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la's wife.\nSince this morning, when first she had heard the terrible news, she had\nnot thought of his death--that awful fate which had so unexpectedly\novertaken him--she had only thought of her own freedom, the peace which\nhenceforth would be hers.\n\nThat was very wrong of course--a grievous sin no doubt the Pater would\ncall it. She shed many tears of contrition, listened eagerly to a kind\nhomily from the old priest on the subject of unnecessary and\nunprofitable searchings of conscience, and went away satisfied.\n\nStrangely enough, after this confession she felt far more sorry for poor\nB\u00c3\u00a9la than she had done before, and she cried her eyes out both before\nand after the funeral because, do what she would, she always saw him\nbefore her as he was that last day of his life--quarrelsome,\ndictatorial, tyrannical--and she remembered how she had almost hated him\nfor his bullying ways and compared him in her mind with Andor's kindness\nand chivalry.\n\nAnd now she cried with remorse because she had hated him during the last\nhours of his life; she cried because he had gone to his death unloved,\nand lay now in his coffin unregretted; she cried because her heart was\nfull and heavy and because in the past week--before her wedding day--she\nhad swallowed so many unshed tears.\n\nAnd while she felt miserable and not a little forlorn she didn't want to\nsee anybody, least of all Andor. Whenever she thought of Andor, the same\nremorse about B\u00c3\u00a9la gnawed again at her heart, for when she thought of\nhim she not only felt at peace, but it seemed as if a ray of happiness\nillumined the past darkness of her life.\n\nOnce or twice during the last day or two, when she had sat stitching,\nshe caught herself singing softly to herself, and once she knew for\ncertain that she had smiled.\n\nThen the day came when Andor called at the house. Irma fortunately was\nout, having coffee and gossip with a friend. No doubt he had watched\nuntil he was sure that she was well out of the way. Then he knocked at\nthe door and entered.\n\nElsa was sitting as usual on the low chair close by the sick man. She\nlooked up when he entered and all at once the blood rushed to her pale\ncheeks.\n\n\"May I come in?\" he asked diffidently.\n\n\"If you like, Andor,\" she replied.\n\nHe threw down his hat and then came to sit on the corner of the table in\nhis favorite attitude and as close to Elsa as he dared. The eyes of the\nparalytic had faintly lit up at his approach.\n\n\"Are you quite well, Elsa?\" he asked after a long pause, during which\nthe girl thought that she could hear the beating of her own heart.\n\n\"Yes. Quite well thank you, Andor,\" she replied softly.\n\n\"No one has seen you in the village this past week,\" he remarked.\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"I am not very fond of gossip, and there was a deal too\nmuch of it in Marosfalva this past week to please me.\"\n\n\"You are right there, Elsa,\" he rejoined, \"but there were others in the\nvillage, you know, those who did not gossip--but whose heart would have\nbeen gladdened by a sight of you.\"\n\n\"Yes, Andor,\" she murmured.\n\nWe may take it that the young man found these laconic answers distinctly\nencouraging, for presently he said abruptly:\n\n\"Perhaps, Elsa, it isn't right for me to begin talking to you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nabout certain matters .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"What matters, Andor?\" she asked ingenuously.\n\n\"Matters which have lain next to my heart, Elsa, for more years now than\nI would care to count.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is a little too soon, Andor--yet--\" she whispered under her\nbreath.\n\nOh! She could have whipped herself for that warm blush which now covered\nnot only her cheeks but her neck and bosom, and for that glow of\nhappiness which had rushed straight at her heart at his words. But he\nhad already seen the blush, and caught that expression of happiness in\nher blue eyes which suddenly made her look as she did of old--five years\nago--before that wan, pathetic expression of resignation had altered her\nsweet face so completely.\n\n\"I don't want to worry you, Elsa,\" he said simply.\n\n\"You couldn't worry me, Andor,\" she said, \"you have always been the best\nfriend I had in the world.\"\n\n\"That is because I have loved you more dearly than anyone ever loved\nyou on this earth,\" he said earnestly.\n\n\"God bless you for that, Andor.\"\n\nHe leaned forward, nearer to her now: his gaze had become more fixed,\nmore compelling. Since he had seen that look on her face and that blush\nhe was sure of his ground; he knew that, given time and peace, the wheel\nof fate, which had already taken an upward turn for him, would soon\ncarry him to the summit of his desires--the woman whom he loved was no\nlonger unattainable and she had remained faithful throughout all this\ntime.\n\n\"Do you think, Elsa,\" he asked more insistently now, and sinking his\nvoice to that whisper which reaches a woman's ear far more truly than\nthe loudest beating of drum, \"do you think that, now that you are free,\nyou could bring yourself to .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. to care .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. to .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0? You were very\nfond of me once, Elsa,\" he pleaded.\n\n\"I am fond of you now, Andor,\" she whispered in response. \"No, no,\" she\nadded hurriedly, for already he had made a movement towards her and the\nnext moment would have been down on his knees with his arms around her,\nbut for the gently-restraining touch of her hand, \"it is too soon to\ntalk about that.\"\n\n\"Yes--too soon,\" he assented with enforced calm, even though his heart\nwas beating furiously; \"it is too soon I know, and I won't worry you,\nElsa--I said I wouldn't and I won't. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I am not a cur to come and\nforce myself on you when you are not ready to listen to me, and we won't\ntalk about it all .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. not just yet.\" .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\n\nHis throat felt very dry, and his tongue felt several sizes too large\nfor his mouth. It was mightily difficult to keep calm and to speak\nsoberly when one's inclination was firstly to dance a war-dance of\ntriumph and of joy and then to take that dear, sweet angel of a woman\nin one's arms and to kiss her till she was ready to faint.\n\n\"When do you think I might speak to you again, Elsa?\" he said, with a\ncertain pathetic hesitancy, \"about .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"About what, Andor?\" she asked.\n\n\"About our getting married--later on.\"\n\n\"Not just yet,\" she murmured, \"but .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"No, no, of course I understand. There are the proprieties and all that\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you were tokened to that blackguard and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Oh! All right, I am\nnot going to say anything against him,\" he added quickly as he saw that\nwords of protest and reproach were already hovering on her lips. \"I\nwon't say anything about him at all except that he is dead now and\nburied, thank the good God! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. And you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you still care for me,\nElsa,\" he continued, whilst a wave of tenderness seemed to sweep all\nother thoughts away. \"No, no, don't say anything--not now--it is too\nsoon, of course--and I've just got to wait till the time comes as best I\ncan. But you mustn't mind my talking on at random like this .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. for I\ntell you I am nearly crazy with joy--and I suppose that you would think\nit very wrong to rejoice like this over another man's death.\"\n\nHis talk was a little wild and rambling--it was obvious that he was half\ndistracted with the prospect of happiness to come. She sat quite still,\nlistening silently, with eyes fixed to the ground. Only now and then she\nwould look up--not at Andor, but at the paralytic who was gazing on her\nwith the sad eyes of uncomprehension. Then she would nod and smile at\nhim and coo in her own motherly way and he would close his\neyes--satisfied.\n\nAnd Andor, who had paused for that brief moment in his voluble talk,\nwent rambling on.\n\n\"You know,\" he said, \"that it's perfectly wonderful .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. this room, I\nmean .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. when I look round me I can hardly credit my eyes. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Just\na week ago .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you remember? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I sat just there .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. at the\nopposite corner of the table, and you had your low chair against the\nwall just here .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and you told me that you were tokened to\nEr\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la and that your wedding would be on the morrow .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. well! That\nwas little more than a week ago .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. before your farewell feast .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nand I thought then that never, never could I be happy again because you\ntold me that never, never could we be anything to each other except a\nkind of friendly strangers. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I remember then how a sort of veil\nseemed to come down in front of my eyes .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. a dark red veil .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nthings didn't look black to me, you know, Elsa .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but red. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. So\nnow I am quite content just to bide my time--I am quite content that you\nshould say nothing to me--nothing _good_, I mean. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. It'll take some\ntime before the thought of so much happiness has got proper root-hold of\nmy brain.\"\n\n\"Poor Andor!\" she sighed, and turned a gaze full of love upon the sick\nman. Her heart was brimming over with it, and so the paralytic got the\nexpression of it in its fullest measure, since Andor was not entitled to\nit yet.\n\n\"But just tell me for certain, Elsa .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. so that I shouldn't have to\ntorment myself in the meanwhile .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. just tell me for certain that one\nday .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. in the far-distant future if you like, but one day .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. say\nthat you will marry me.\"\n\n\"Some day, Andor, I will marry you if God wills,\" she said simply.\n\n\"Oh! But of course He will!\" he rejoined airily, \"and we will be married\nin the spring--or the early summer when the maize is just beginning to\nripen .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and we'll rent the mill from Pali b\u00c3\u00a1csi--shall we, Elsa?\"\n\n\"If you like, Andor.\"\n\n\"If I like!\" he exclaimed. \"If I like! The dear God love me, but I think\nthat if I stay here much longer I shall go off my head. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Elsa, you\ndon't know how much I love you and what I would not do for your sake.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I feel a different man even for the joy of sitting here and\ntalking to you and no one having the right to interfere. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. And I\nwould make you happy, Elsa, that I swear by the living God. I would make\nyou happy and I would work to keep you in comfort all the days of my\nlife. You shall be just as fine as Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la would have made you--and\nbesides that, there would be a smile on your sweet face at every hour of\nthe day .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. your hands would be as white as those of my lady the\nCountess herself, for I would have a servant to wait on you. And your\nfather would come and live with us and we would make him happy and\ncomfortable too, and your mother .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. well! your mother would be happy\ntoo, and therefore not quite so cantankerous as she sometimes is.\"\n\nTo Andor there was nothing ahead but a life full of sunshine. He never\nlooked back on the past few days and on the burden of sin which they\nbore. B\u00c3\u00a9la had been a brute of the most coarse and abominable type; by\nhis monstrous conduct on the eve of his wedding day he had walked to his\ndeath--of his own accord. Andor had _not_ sent him. Oh! he was quite,\nquite sure that he had not sent B\u00c3\u00a9la to his death. He had merely forborn\nto warn him--and surely there could be no sin in that.\n\nHe might have told B\u00c3\u00a9la that Leopold Hirsch--half mad with jealousy--was\noutside on the watch with a hunting-knife in his pocket and murder in\nhis soul. Andor might have told B\u00c3\u00a9la this and he had remained silent.\nWas that a sin? considering what a brute the man was, how his action\nthat night was a deadly insult put upon Elsa, and how he would in the\nfuture have bullied and browbeaten Elsa and made her life a misery--a\nveritable hell upon earth.\n\nAndor had thought the problem out; he had weighed it in his mind and he\nwas satisfied that he had not really committed a sin. Of course he ought\nbefore now to have laid the whole case before Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius, and the\nPater would have told him just what God's view would be of the whole\naffair.\n\nThe fact that Andor had not thought of going to confession showed that\nhe was not quite sure what God--as represented by Pater\nBonif\u00c3\u00a1cius--would think of it all; but he meant to go by and by and\nconclude a permanent and fulsome peace treaty with his conscience.\n\nIn the meanwhile, even though the burden of remorse should at times in\nthe future weigh upon his soul and perhaps spoil a little of his\nhappiness, well! he would have to put up with it, and that was\nall!--Elsa was happy--one sight of her radiant little face was enough\nfor any fool to see that an infinite sense of relief had descended into\nher soul. Elsa was happy--freed from the brute who would have made her\nwretched for the rest of her life; and surely the good God, who could\nread the secret motives which lay in a fellow's heart, would not be hard\non Andor for what he had done--or left undone--for Elsa's sake.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n\"Kyrie eleison.\"\n\n\nBut the daily routine of everyday life went on at Marosfalva just as it\nhad done before the double tragedy of St. Michael's E'en had darkened\nthe pages of its simple history.\n\nThe maize had all been gathered in--ploughing had begun--my lord and his\nguests were shooting in the stubble. The first torrential rain had\nfallen and the waters of the Maros had begun to swell.\n\nGossip about Er\u00c3\u00b6s B\u00c3\u00a9la's terrible end and Leopold Hirsch's suicide had\nnot by any means been exhausted, but it was supplemented now by talk of\nLakatos P\u00c3\u00a1l's wealth. The old man had been ailing for some time. His\nnephew Andor's return had certainly cheered him up for a while, but soon\nafter that he seemed to collapse very suddenly in health, like old folk\ndo in this part of the world--stricken down by one or other of the\nseveral diseases which are engendered by the violent extremes of heat\nand cold--diseases of the liver for the most part--the beginning of a\nslowly-oncoming end.\n\nHe had always been reputed to be a miser, and those who were in the know\nnow averred that Andor had found several thousand florins tucked away in\nold bits of sacking and hidden under his uncle's straw paillasse. Pali\nb\u00c3\u00a1csi was also possessed of considerable property--some land, a farm and\nthe mill; there was no doubt now that Andor would be a very rich man one\nof these days.\n\nMothers with marriageable daughters sighed nevertheless in vain. Andor\nwas not for any of them. Andor had eyes only for Elsa. He had become an\nimportant man in the village now that his uncle was so ill and he was\nleft to administer the old man's property; and he took his duties very\nearnestly in the intervals of courting Kapus Elsa.\n\nAs to this no one had cause to make any objection. They had loved one\nanother and been true to one another for five years; it was clearly the\nwill of the good God that they should come together at last.\n\nAnd now October was drawing to its close--to-day was the fourth Sunday\nin the month and one of the numerous feasts of our Blessed Lady, one on\nwhich solemn benediction is appointed to be sung in the early afternoon,\nand benediction is followed by a procession to the shrine of the Virgin\nwhich stands on the roadside on the way to Sabors\u00c3\u00b3 some two kilom\u00c3\u00a8tres\ndistant from Marosfalva. It is a great festival and one to which the\npeasantry of the countryside look forward with great glee, for they love\nthe procession and have a great faith in the efficacy of prayer said at\nthe shrine.\n\nFortunately the day turned out to be one of the most glorious sunshiny\ndays which mid-autumn can yield, and the little church in the afternoon\nwas crowded in every corner. The older women--their heads covered with\ndark-coloured handkerchiefs, occupied the left side of the aisle, the\nmen crowded in on the right and at the back under the organ loft. Round\nabout the chancel rail and steps the bevy of girls in gayest Sunday\ndresses looked like a garden of giant animated flowers. When the sexton\nwent the round with the collecting-bag tied to the end of a long pole,\nhe had the greatest difficulty in making his way through the maze of\nmany-hued petticoats which, as the girls knelt, stood all round them\nlike huge bells, with their slim shoulders and small heads above looking\nfor all the world like the handles.\n\nThe children were all placed in the chancel to right and left of the\naltar, solemn and well-behaved, with one eye on the schoolmistress and\nthe other on the Pater.\n\nAfter the service the order of procession was formed, inside the church:\nthe children in the forefront with banner carried by the head of the\nschool--a sturdy maiden on the fringe of her teens, very proud to carry\nthe Blessed Virgin's banner. She squared her shoulders well, for the\nbanner was heavy, and the line of her young hips--well accentuated by\nthe numerous petticoats which a proud mother had tied round her\nwaist--gave a certain dignity to her carriage and natural grace to her\nmovements.\n\nBehind the children came the young girls--those of a marriageable age\nwhom a pious custom dedicates most specially to the service of Our Lady.\nTheir banner was of blue silk, and most of them were dressed in blue,\nwhilst blue ribbons fluttered round their heads as they walked.\n\nThen came Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius under a velvet-covered dais which was carried\nby four village lads. He wore his vestments and carried a holy relic in\nhis hands; the choir-boys swinging their metal censers were in front of\nhim in well-worn red cassocks and surplices beautifully ironed and\nstarched for the occasion.\n\nIn the rear the crowd rapidly closed in; the younger men had a banner to\nthemselves, and there were the young matrons, the mothers, the fathers,\nthe old and the lonely.\n\nThe sexton threw open the doors, and slowly the little procession filed\nout. Outside a brilliant sunshine struck full on the whitewashed walls\nof the little school-house opposite. It was so dazzling that it made\neverybody blink as they stepped out from the semi-dark church into this\nmagnificent flood of light.\n\nIn the street round the church a pathetic group awaited the appearance\nof the procession, those that were too old to walk two kilom\u00c3\u00a8tres to the\nshrine, those who were lame and those who were sick. Simply and with\nuninquiring minds, they knelt or stood in the roadway, content to watch\nthe banners as they swung gaily to the rhythmic movements of the\nbearers, content to see the holy relics in the Pater's hand, content to\nfeel that subtle wave of religious sentiment pass over them which made\nthem at peace with their little world and brought the existence of God\nnearer to their comprehension.\n\nSlowly the procession wound its way down the village street. Pater\nBonif\u00c3\u00a1cius had intoned the opening orisons of the Litany:\n\n\"Kyrie eleison!\"\n\nAnd men and women chanted the response in that quaintly harsh tone which\nthe Magyar language assumes when it is sung. The brilliant sunlight\nplayed on the smooth hair of the girls, the golds, the browns and the\nblacks, and threw sharp glints on the fluttering ribbons of many colours\nwhich a light autumn breeze was causing to dance gaily and restlessly.\nThe whole village was hushed save for the Litany, the clinking of the\nmetal chains as the choir-boys swung the censers and the frou-frou of\nhundreds of starched petticoats--superposed, brushing one against the\nother with a ceaseless movement which produced a riot of brilliant\ncolouring.\n\nSoon the main road was reached, and now the vast immensity of the plain\nlay in front and all round--all the more vast and immense now it seemed,\nsince not even the nodding plumes of maize or tall, stately sunflowers\nveiled the mystery of that low-lying horizon far away.\n\nNothing around now, save that group of willow trees by the bank of the\nturbulent Maros--nothing except the stubble--stumps of maize and pumpkin\nand hemp, and rigid lines of broken-down stems of sunflowers, with\ndrooping, dead leaves, and brown life still oozing out of the torn\nstems.\n\nAnd in the immensity, the sweet, many-toned sounds of summer--the call\nof birds, the quiver of growing things, the trembling of ripening\ncorn--has yielded to the sad tune of autumn--a tune made up of the\nhushed sighs of dying nature, as she sinks slowly and peacefully into\nher coming winter's sleep. The swallows and the storks have gone away\nlong ago. They know that in this land of excessive heat and winter\nrigours, frost and snow tread hard on the heels of a warm, autumnal day.\nOnly a flight of rooks breaks the even line of the sky; their cawing\nalone makes at times a weird accompaniment to the chanting of the\nLitany. And the Maros--no longer sluggish--now sends her swollen waters\nwith a dull, rumbling sound westward to the arms of the mother stream.\n\nSilence and emptiness!\n\nNothing except the sky, with its unending panorama of ever-varying\nclouds, and its infinite, boundless, mysterious horizon, which enfolds\nthe world of the plains in a limitless embrace. Nothing except the\nstubble and the sky, and far, very far away, a lonely cottage, with its\nsurrounding group of low, mop-head acacias, and the gaunt, straight arm\nof a well pointing upwards to the sun.\n\nAnd through the silent, vast immensity the little procession of village\nfolk, with banners flying and quaint, harsh voices singing the Litany,\nwinds its way along the flat, sandy road, like a brightly-coloured\nribbon thrown there by a giant hand, and made to flutter and to move by\na giant's breath.\n\nPresently the shrine came in sight: just a dark speck at first in the\nmidst of the great loneliness, then more and more distinct--there on the\nroadside--all by itself without a tree near it--lonely in the bosom of\nthe plain.\n\nThe procession came to a halt in front of it, and two hundred pairs of\neyes, brimful with simple faith and simple trust, gazed in reverence on\nthe na\u00c3\u00afve wax figure behind the grating, within its throne of rough\nstone and whitewash. It was dressed in blue calico spangled with tinsel,\nand had a crown on its head made of gilt paper and a veil of coarse\ntarlatan. Two china pots containing artificial flowers were placed on\neither side of the little image.\n\nIt was all very crude, very rough, very na\u00c3\u00afve, but a fervent,\nunsophisticated imagination had endowed it with a beauty all the more\nreal, perhaps, because it only existed in the hearts of a handful of\nignorant children of the soil. It made Something seem real to them which\notherwise might have been difficult to grasp; and now when Pater\nBonif\u00c3\u00a1cius in his gentle, cracked voice intoned the invocations of the\nLitany, the \"Salus infirmorum\" and \"Refugium peccatorum\" and, above all,\nthe \"Consolatrix afflictorum\" the response \"Ora pro nobis\" came from two\nhundred trusting hearts--praying, if not for themselves, then for those\nwho were dear to them: the infirm, the sinner, the afflicted.\n\nAnd among those two hundred hearts none felt the need for prayer more\nthan Andor and Elsa. They had left affliction behind them, they stood\nupon the threshold of a new life--where happiness alone beckoned to\nthem, and sorrow and parting lay vanquished behind the gates of the\npast. But in spite, or perhaps because, of this happiness which beckoned\nso near now, there was a tinge of sadness in their hearts, that sadness\nwhich always comes with joy once extreme youth has gone by .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. the\nsadness which hovers over finite things, the sense of future which so\nquickly becomes the past.\n\nFrom where Andor stood, holding the dais above Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius' head,\nhe could see Elsa's smooth, fair head among the crowd of other girls.\nShe had tied her hair in at the nape of the neck with a bit of blue\nribbon, leaving it to fall lower down in two thick plaits well below her\nwaist. She looked like a huge blue gentian kissed by the sun, for her\ntop petticoat was of blue cotton, and her golden head seemed like the\nsweet-scented stamen.\n\nAndor thought that he could hear her voice above that of everyone else,\nand when Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius intoned the \"Regina angelorum\" he thought that\nindeed the heavenly Queen had no fairer subject up there than Elsa.\n\nWhen the little procession was once more ready to return to the village,\nthe bearers of the dais were relieved by four other lads, and Andor\nfound the means, during the slight hubbub which occurred while the\nprocession was being formed, of working his way close to Elsa's side.\n\nIt was not an unusual thing for young men and girls who had much to say\nto one another to fall away from the procession on its way home, and to\nwander back arm in arm through the maize-fields or over the stubble,\neven as their shadows lengthened out upon the ground.\n\nAndor's hand had caught hold of Elsa's elbow, and with insistent\npressure he kept her out of the group of her companions. Gradually the\nprocession was formed, and slowly it began to move, the banners\nfluttered once more in the breeze, once more the monotonous chant broke\nthe silence of the plain.\n\nBut Elsa and Andor had remained behind close beside the shrine. She had\nyielded to his insistence, knowing what it was that he meant to say to\nher while they walked together toward the sunset. She knew what he\nwanted to say, and what he expected her to promise, and he knew that at\nlast she was ready to listen, and that she would no longer hold her\nheart in check, but let it flow over with all the love which it\ncontained, and that she was ready at last to hold up to him that cup of\nhappiness for which he craved.\n\nOne or two couples had also remained behind, but they had already\nwandered off toward the bank of the Maros. Elsa had knelt down before\nthe crude image of the \"Consoler of the afflicted;\" her rosary was wound\nround her fingers, she prayed in her simple soul, fervently,\nunquestioningly, for happiness and for peace.\n\nThen, when the little procession in the distance became wrapped in the\ngolden haze which hung over the plain, and the chanting of the Litany\ncame but as a murmur on the wings of the autumn breeze, she took Andor's\narm, and together they walked slowly back toward home.\n\nThe peace which rests over the plain enveloped them both; from the sky\nabove the last vestige of cloud had been driven away by the breeze, and\nfar away on that distant horizon where lay the land of the unknown the\nsun was slowly sinking to rest.\n\nLike a huge, drooping rose it seemed--its rays like petals falling away\nfrom it one by one. Mute yet quivering was the plain around, pulsating\nwith life, yet silent in its autumnal agony. From far away came the\nsweet sound of the evening Angelus rung from the village\nchurch--distant and soft, like a sound from heaven or like an echo of\nsome beautiful dream.\n\nAnd these two were alone with the sunset and with the stubble--alone in\nthis vastness which is so like the sea--alone--two tiny, moving black\nspecks with a background of radiance and a golden haze to envelop them.\nIn this immensity it seemed so much more easy to speak of love--for love\ncould fill the plain and find room for its own immensity in this\nvastness which knows no trammels. To Andor and Elsa it seemed as if at\nlast the plain had revealed its secret to them, had lifted for them that\nveil of mystery which wraps her up all round where earth and sky meet in\nthe golden distance beyond.\n\nThey knew suddenly just what lay behind the veil, they knew if it were\nlifted what it was that they would see--the land of gold was the land of\nlove, where men and women wandered hand in hand, where sorrow was a\ndwarf and grief a cripple, since love--the Almighty King of the unknown\nland--had wounded them and vanquished them both.\n\nAnd they, too, now wandered toward that land, even though it still\nseemed very far away. To the accompaniment of the Angelus bell they\nwandered, with the distant echo of the chanted Litany still ringing in\ntheir ear. The plain encompassed her children with her all-embracing\npeace, and she gave them this one supreme moment of happiness to-day,\nwhile the setting sun clothed the horizon with gold.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n\"What about me.\"\n\n\nAnd time slipped by with murmurings of words that have no meaning save\nfor one pair of ears. Andor talked fondly and foolishly, and Elsa mostly\nwas silent. She had loved this walk over the stubble, and the plain had\nbeen in perfect peace save for the rumbling of the Maros, insistent and\nmenacing, which had struck a chill to the girl's heart, like a presage\nof evil.\n\nShe tried to swallow her fears, chiding herself for feeling them, doing\nher best to close her ears to those rumbling, turbulent waters that\nseemed to threaten as they tumbled along on their way.\n\nGradually as they neared the village that curious feeling of impending\nevil became more strong: she could not help speaking of it to Andor, but\nhe only laughed in that delightfully happy--almost defiantly happy--way\nof his, and for a moment or two she was satisfied.\n\nBut when at about half a kilom\u00c3\u00a8tre from home she caught sight of Klara\nGoldstein walking away from the village straight toward her and Andor,\nit seemed as if her fears had suddenly assumed a more tangible shape.\n\nKlara looked old and thin, she thought, pathetic, too, in her plain\nblack dress--she who used to be so fond of pretty clothes. Elsa gave her\na hearty greeting as soon as she was near enough to her, and extended a\ncordial hand. She had no cause to feel well-disposed toward the Jewess,\nbut there was something so forlorn-looking about the girl now, and such\na look of sullen despair in her dark eyes, that Elsa's gentle nature was\nat once ready to forgive and to cheer.\n\n\"It is a long time since I have seen you, Klara,\" she said pleasantly.\n\n\"No wonder,\" said the other girl, with a shrug of her thin shoulders,\n\"father won't let me out of his sight.\"\n\nShe had nodded to Andor, but by tacit consent they had not shaken hands.\nKlara now put her hands on her hips, and, like a young animal let free\nafter days of captivity, she drew in deep breaths of sweet-scented air.\n\n\"Ah!\" she said with a sigh, \"it is good to be out again; being a\nprisoner doesn't suit me, I can tell you that.\"\n\n\"Your dear father seems to be very severe with you, Klara,\" said Elsa\ncompassionately.\n\n\"Yes! curse him!\" retorted the Jewess fiercely, as a savage, cruel look\nflashed through her sunken eyes. \"He nearly killed me when he came home\nfrom Kecskem\u00c3\u00a9t that time--beat me like a dog--and now .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Poor Klara!\"\n\n\"I shouldn't have minded the beating so much. Among our people, parents\nhave the right to be severe, and it is better to take a beating from\nyour father than to be punished by the rabbi.\"\n\n\"Your dear father will forgive you in time,\" suggested Elsa gently.\n\nShe felt miserably uncomfortable, and would have given worlds to be rid\nof Klara. She couldn't think why the girl had stopped to talk to her and\nAndor: in fact she was more than sure that Klara had come out this\nevening on purpose to talk to her and to Andor; for now she stood\ndeliberately in front of them both with arms crossed in front of her and\ndefiant eyes fixed now upon one and now upon the other. Andor too was\nbeginning to look cross and sullen; this meeting coming on the top of\nthat lovely walk seemed like a black shadow cast over the radiance of\ntheir happiness, and this thin, tall girl, all in black, with black hair\nfluttering round her pale face, seemed like a big black bird of evil\npresage: her skirts flapped round her knees like wings and her voice\nsounded cold and harsh like the croaking of a raven.\n\nBut Elsa's kindly disposition did not allow her to be too obviously\nunkind to the Jewess. Perhaps after all the girl meant no harm, and had\nonly run out now like a released colt, glad to feel freedom in the air\naround her and the vastness lying stretched out before her to infinity\nbeyond. Perhaps she had only sought the company of the first-comers in\norder to get a small measure of sympathy. But now, though Elsa's gentle\nwords should have softened her mood, she retorted with renewed\nfierceness:\n\n\"Curse him! I don't want his forgiveness! and if ever he wants mine--on\nhis deathbed--he won't get it--even if he should die in torment for want\nof a kind word from me.\"\n\n\"Klara, you mustn't say that,\" cried Elsa, horrified at what she\nconsidered almost blasphemy. \"Your father is your father, remember--and\neven if he has been harsh to you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nKlara interrupted her with a loud and strident laugh.\n\n\"If he has been harsh to me!\" she exclaimed. \"Didn't I tell you that he\nthrashed me like a dog, so that I was sick for days. But I wouldn't mind\nthat so much. Bruises mend sooner or later, but it's that abominable\nmarriage which will make me curse him to my dying day.\"\n\n\"Marriage? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. what marriage? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"With a man I had never seen in my life until it was all settled. Just a\nman who is so ugly and so bad-tempered and so repugnant to every girl\nwhom he knows that nobody would have him--but just a man who wanted a\nwife. The rabbi at Arad knew about him and he spoke about him to\nfather--it seems that he is quite rich--and father has given me to him\nand I am to be married within a fortnight. Curse them! curse them all, I\nsay! Oh! I wish I had the pluck to run away, or to kill myself or do\nsomething--but I am such an abominable coward--and I shall loathe to\nlive in Arad in a tiny secondhand clothes shop, with that hideous\nmonster for a husband--pointed at by everyone as the girl with a\ndisgraceful story to her credit and sold to a creature whom no one else\nwould have--in order to cover up a scandal.\"\n\nElsa was silent; her heart now was full of pity for the girl, who indeed\nwas being punished far more severely than she deserved. It was clear\nthat Klara was terribly resentful at her fate, and there was a look of\nvengeful rebellion in the glance which she threw on Elsa and Andor now.\n\nOverhead there was flapping of wings--a flight of rooks cut through the\nair and there were magpies in their trail.\n\n\"Three for a wedding,\" said Andor with a forced laugh, trying to break\nthe spell which--much against his will--seemed to have been suddenly\ncast over his happy spirits.\n\n\"One for sorrow, more like,\" retorted Klara.\n\n\"No, no, come!\" he rejoined; \"you must not look at it like that. There\nis always some happiness to be got out of married life. You are not very\nhappy in your old home--you will like to have one of your own--a wedding\nis only the prelude to better things.\"\n\n\"That depends on the wedding, my friend,\" she sneered; \"this one will\nbe a finish, not a prelude--the naughty child, well whipped, sent out of\nmischief's way.\"\n\n\"I am sorry, Klara, that you feel it so strongly,\" he said more kindly.\n\n\"Yes,\" she retorted. \"I dare say, my good man, you are sorry enough for\nme now, but you might have thought of all that, you know, before you\nplayed me that dirty trick.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he broke in quickly.\n\n\"Just what I say,\" she replied, \"and no more. A dirty, abominable trick,\nI call it, and I cannot even show you up before the village--I could not\neven speak of you to the police officers. Oh, yes!\" she continued more\nand more vehemently, as a flood of wrath and of resentment and a burning\ndesire for getting even with Fate seemed literally to sweep her off her\nmental balance and cause her to lose complete control of her tongue,\n\"oh, yes! my fine gentleman! you can go and court Elsa now, and whisper\nsweet love-words in her ears--you two turtle-doves are the edification\nof the entire village now--and presently you will get married and live\nhappy ever afterwards. But what I want to ask you, my friend,\" she\nadded, and she took a step or two nearer to him, until her hot and angry\nbreath struck him in the face and he was forced to draw himself back,\naway from that seething cauldron of resentment and of vengeance which\nwas raging before him now, \"what I want to ask you is have you ever\nthought of me?\"\n\n\"Thought of you, Klara?\" he said quietly, even as he felt, more than\nsaw, that Elsa too had drawn back a little--a step or two further away\nfrom Klara, but a step or two also further away from him. \"Thought of\nyou?\" he reiterated, seeing that Klara did not reply immediately, and\nthat just for one brief moment--it was a mere flash--a look of\nirresolution had crept into her eyes, \"why should I be thinking about\nyou?\"\n\n\"Why, indeed?\" she said with a wrathful sneer. \"What hurt had I done to\nyou, Andor, that is what I want to know. I was always friendly to you. I\nhad never done you any wrong--nor did I do Elsa any wrong--any wrong, I\nmean, that mattered,\" she continued, talking more loudly and more\nvolubly because Andor was making desperate efforts to stop and interrupt\nher. \"B\u00c3\u00a9la would only have run after another woman if I had turned my\nback on him. And then when you asked me to leave him alone, I promised,\ndidn't I? What you asked me to do I promised. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. And I meant to keep\nmy promise to you, and you knew it .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and yet you rounded on me like\nthat. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Silence, Klara,\" he cried at the top of his voice as he shook the girl\nroughly by the shoulder.\n\nBut she paid no heed to him--she was determined to be heard, determined\nto have her say. All the bitterness in her had been bottled up for\nweeks. She meant to meet Andor face to face before she was packed off as\nthe submissive wife of a hated husband--the naughty child, whipped and\nsent out of the way--she meant to throw all the pent-up bitterness\nwithin her, straight into his face--and meant to do it when Elsa was\nnigh. For days and days she had watched for an opportunity; but her\nfather had kept her a prisoner in the house, besides which she had no\ngreat desire to affront the sneering looks of village gossips. But this\nevening was her opportunity. For this she had waited, and now she meant\nto take it, and no power on earth, force or violence would prevent her\nfrom pouring out the full phial of her venomous wrath.\n\n\"I will not be silent,\" she shrieked, \"I will not! You did round on me\nlike a cur--you sneak--you double-faced devil. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Will you be silent!\" he hissed through his teeth, his face deadly pale\nnow with a passion of wrath at least as fierce as hers.\n\nBut now Elsa's quiet voice interposed between these two tempestuous\nsouls.\n\n\"No!\" she said firmly, \"Klara shall not be silent, Andor. Let go her arm\nand let her speak. I want to hear what she has to say.\"\n\n\"She is trying to come between you and me, Elsa,\" said Andor, who was\ntrying to keep his violent rage in check. \"She tried to come between you\nand B\u00c3\u00a9la, and chose an ugly method to get at what she wanted. She hates\nyou .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. why I don't know, but she does hate you, and she always tries\nto do you harm. Don't listen to her, I tell you. Why! just look at her\nnow! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. the girl is half mad.\"\n\n\"Mad?\" broke in Klara, as with a jerky movement of her shoulders she\ndisengaged herself from Andor's rough grasp. \"I dare say I am mad. And\nso would you be,\" she added, turning suddenly to Elsa, \"so would you be,\nif all in one night you were to lose everything you cared for in the\nworld--your freedom--the consideration of your friends--the man who some\nday would have made you a good husband--everything, everything--and all\nbecause of that sneaking, double-faced coward.\"\n\n\"If you don't hold your tongue .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" cried Andor menacingly.\n\n\"You will kill me, won't you?\" she sneered. \"One murder more or less on\nyour conscience won't hurt you any more, will it, my friend? You will\nkill me, eh? Then you'll have two of us to your reckoning by and by, me\nand B\u00c3\u00a9la!\"\n\n\"B\u00c3\u00a9la!\" the cry, which sounded like a protest--hot, indignant,\ndefensive--came from Elsa. She was paler than either of the others, and\nher glowing, inquiring eyes were fixed upon Klara with the look of an\nuntamed creature ready to defend and to protect the thing that it holds\ndear.\n\n\"Don't listen to her, Elsa,\" pleaded Andor in a voice rendered hoarse\nwith an overwhelming apprehension.\n\nHe felt as if his happiness, his life, the whole of this living,\nbreathing world were slipping away from him--as if he had suddenly woke\nup from a beautiful, peaceful dream and found himself on the edge of a\nprecipice and unable, in this sudden rude awakening, to keep a foothold\nupon the shifting sands. There was a mist before his eyes--a mist which\nseemed to envelop Elsa more and more, making her slim, exquisite figure\nappear more dim, blurring the outline of her gold-crowned head, getting\nmore and more dense until even her blue eyes had disappeared away from\nhim--away--snatched from his grasp--wafted away by that mist to the\ndistant land beyond the low-lying horizon.\n\nSomething in the agony of his appeal, something in the pathos of Elsa's\ndefiant attitude must have struck a more gentle cord in the Jewess'\nheart. The tears gathered in her eyes--tears of self-pity at the misery\nwhich she seemed to be strewing all round her with a free hand.\n\n\"I don't think that I really meant to tell you, Elsa,\" she said more\nquietly, \"not lately, at any rate. Oh, I dare say at first I did mean to\nhurt you--but a month has gone by and I was beginning to forget. People\nused to say of me that I was a good sort--it was the hurt that _he_ did\nme that seems to have made a devil of me. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. And then--just now when\nI saw the other folk coming home in the procession and noticed that you\nand Andor weren't among them, I guessed that you would be walking back\ntogether arm-in-arm--and that the whole world would be smiling on you\nboth, while I was eating out my heart in misery.\"\n\nShe was speaking with apparent calm now, in a dull and monotonous voice,\nher eyes fixed upon the distant line of the horizon, where the glowing\nsun had at last sunk to rest. The brilliant orange and blood-red of the\nsky had yielded to a colder crimson tint--it, too, was now slowly\nturning to grey.\n\nElsa stood silent, listening, and Andor no longer tried to force Klara\nto silence. What was the good? Fate had spoken through her lips--God's\nwrath, perhaps, had willed it so. For the first time in all these weeks\nhe realized that perhaps he had committed a deadly sin, and that he had\nhad no right to reckon on happiness coming to him, because of it. He\nstood there, dazed, letting the Jewess have her way. What did it matter\nhow much more she said? Perhaps, on the whole, it was best that Elsa\nshould learn the whole truth now.\n\nAnd Klara continued to speak in listless, apathetic tones, letting her\ntongue run on as if she had lost control over what she said, and as if a\nhigher Fate was forcing her to speak against her will.\n\n\"I suppose,\" she said thoughtfully, \"that some kind of devil did get\ninto my bones then. I wandered out into the stubble, and I saw you\ntogether coming from the distance. The sunlight was full upon you, and\nlong before you saw me I saw your faces quite distinctly. There was so\nmuch joy, so much happiness in you both, that I seemed to see it shining\nout of your eyes. And I was so broken and so wretched that I couldn't\nbear to see Andor so happy with the girl who rightly belonged to\nB\u00c3\u00a9la--the wretched man whom he himself had sent to his death.\"\n\n\"Whom he himself had sent to his death?\" broke in Elsa quietly. \"What do\nyou mean, Klara?\"\n\n\"I mean that it was young Count Feri who was to have come to see me that\nnight. Father being away, he wanted to come and have a little chat and a\nbit of supper with me. There was no harm in that, was there? He didn't\ncare to be seen walking in at the front door--as there's always such a\nlot of gossip in this village--so he asked me for the back-door key, and\nI gave it to him.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Leopold missed the key later on, and guessed I had given it to Count\nFeri. He was mad with jealousy and threatened to kill anyone who dared\ncome sneaking in round the back way. He wouldn't let me out of his\nsight--and threatened to strangle me if I attempted to go and get the\nkey back from Count Feri. I was nearly crazy with fear. Wouldn't you\nhave been,\" she added defiantly, \"if you had a madman to deal with and\nno one near to protect you?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" replied Elsa, under her breath.\n\n\"Then Andor came into the tap-room. With soft words and insinuating\npromises he got me to tell him what had happened. I didn't want to at\nfirst--I mistrusted him because of what had happened at the banquet--I\nknew that he hated me because of you.\"\n\n\"It is not true,\" broke in Andor involuntarily.\n\n\"Let her tell her story her own way,\" rejoined Elsa, with the same\nstrange quiet which seemed now to envelop her soul.\n\n\"There's nothing more to tell,\" retorted Klara. \"Nothing, at any rate,\nthat you haven't guessed already. I told Andor all about Count Feri and\nthe key, and how terrified I was that Leopold would do some deadly\nmischief. He offered to go to the castle and get the key away from the\nyoung Count.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well! Andor was in love with you, wasn't he?\" she continued, speaking\nonce more with vehemence; \"he wanted you, didn't he? And he hated B\u00c3\u00a9la\nhaving you. He hated me, too, of course. So he got the key away from\nCount Feri, and later on, after you had followed B\u00c3\u00a9la almost to the\ntap-room and you had some words with him just outside .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you\nremember?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Andor had the key in his pocket then--and he gave it to B\u00c3\u00a9la. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nThere was silence for awhile now--that silence which falls upon the\nplain during the first hour after sunset--and which falls upon human\ncreatures when destiny has spoken her last word. In the village far away\nthe worshippers had gone back into the church, all sound of chanting and\npraying had died away behind its walls; there was no flight of birds\noverhead, nor call of waterfowl from the bank of the stream, the autumn\nbreeze had gone to rest with the sun, the leaves of acacias and willows\nlay still, and even the turbulent waters of the Maros seemed momentarily\nhushed.\n\n\"Is that true, Andor?\"\n\nIt was Elsa's voice that spoke, but the voice sounded muffled and dull,\nas if it came from far away or from out the depths of the earth. Then,\nas Andor made no reply, but gazed on Elsa in mute and passionate appeal,\nlike a man who is drowning would gaze on the shore which he cannot\nreach, Klara said slowly:\n\n\"Oh! it's true enough. You cannot deny it, can you, Andor? You wanted\nyour revenge on me, and you wanted to be rid of B\u00c3\u00a9la--you wanted Elsa\nfor yourself, but you didn't care one brass fill\u00c3\u00a9r what would become of\nme after that. You left me without a thought, lonely and unprotected,\nknowing that a madman was prowling outside, ready to kill me or any man\nwho came along. You gave B\u00c3\u00a9la that key, didn't you? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and told him\nnothing about Leopold--and you didn't care what became of me, so long as\nyou got rid of B\u00c3\u00a9la and could have Elsa for yourself.\"\n\n\"And now you have had your say, Klara,\" said Andor, breaking with a\nmighty effort the spell of silence which had held him all this while;\n\"you have made all the mischief that you wanted to make. Suppose you\nleave us alone now .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Elsa and me .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. alone with the misery which\nyou have created for us.\"\n\nThen, as for a moment she didn't move, but looked on him through\nnarrowed lids and with a sneer, half of pity and half of triumph, he\ncontinued with a sudden outburst of fierceness:\n\n\"Well! you have had your say! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Why don't you go?\"\n\nKlara shrugged her shoulders and said more lightly:\n\n\"Oh, very well, my friend, I'll go. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Good-bye, Elsa,\" she added,\nwith sudden earnestness. \"I don't suppose that you want to shake hands\nwith me--and I dare say it's no use asking you to think kindly of\nme--but I wish you would try and believe that I am sorry I lost myself\nas I did. I don't think that I ever would have told you if I hadn't seen\n_him_ looking so happy and so complacent after the horrible, dirty trick\nwhich he played me. People used to say that I had a good heart, but, by\nthe Almighty, I declare that I seem to have lost my head lately. That's\nwhat I say, Elsa. It's all very well, but what about me? What had I\ndone?--and now, look at my life! But don't you fret about him or any\nother man. Take my word for it, men are not worth it.\"\n\nAnd having said that she turned on her heel and slowly walked away,\nleaving behind her an ocean of desolation. She walked away--with a slow,\nswinging stride, one hand on her hip, her head thrown back.\n\nFor a long time her darkly-clad figure was silhouetted against the\nevening sky, a speck of blackness upon the immensity around. Elsa\nwatched her go, watched that tiny black speck which, like the locust\nwhich at times devastates the plains, had left behind it an irreparable\ntrail of misery.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n\"The land beyond the sunset.\"\n\n\nAnd now the shadows of evening were slowly invading the plains. The\nautumn wind, lulled for a time to rest with the setting of the sun, had\nsprung up in angry gusts, lashing up clouds from the southwest and\nsending them to tear along and efface the last vestige of the evening\ncrimson glow.\n\nElsa and Andor had both remained quite still after Klara left them; yet\nElsa--like all simple creatures who feel acutely--was longing to run and\nlet the far horizon, the distant unknown land, wrap and enfold her while\nshe thought things out for herself, for indeed this real world--the\nworld of men and women, of passions and hatred and love--was nothing but\na huge and cruel puzzle. She longed for solitude--the solitude which the\nplains can offer in such absolute completeness--because her heart was\nheavy and she felt that if she were all alone she might ease the weight\non her heart in a comforting flow of tears.\n\nBut this would not have been kind to Andor. She could not leave him now,\nwhen he looked so broken down with sorrow and misery and doubt. So,\nafter a little while, when she felt that if she spoke her voice would be\nquite steady, she said gently:\n\n\"It is not all true, is it, Andor?\"\n\nShe could not--she would not believe it all true--not in the way that\nKlara had put it before her, with all its horrible details of\ncallousness and cowardice. For more years than she could remember she\nhad loved and trusted Andor--she had known his simple, loyal nature, his\nkind and gentle ways--a few spiteful words from a jealous woman were not\nlikely to tear down in a moment the solid edifice of her affection and\nher confidence. True! his silence had told her something that was a\nbitter truth; his passionate rage against Klara had been like a cruel\nstab right into her heart--but even then she wanted the confirmation\nwhich could only come from his own lips--and for this she waited when\nshe asked him, quite simply, altogether trustingly:\n\n\"It is not true, is it?\"\n\nNor did it occur to Andor to lie to her about it all; the thought of\ndenial never for one moment entered his head. The fatalism peculiar to\nthis Oriental race made the man scorn to shield himself behind a lie.\nB\u00c3\u00a9la was now for ever silent; the young Count would scorn to speak! His\nown protestations in the ear of this loving, simple-minded girl, against\nthe accusations of a woman of the despised race--jealous, bitter,\navowedly half-crazy--needed only to be uttered in order to be\nwhole-heartedly believed. But even the temptation to pursue such a\ncourse never assailed his soul. With the limitless sky above him, the\nvast immensity of the plains stretching out unbroken far away, with the\nland under his feet and the scent of the maize-stubble in his nostrils,\nhe was too proud of himself as a man to stoop to such a lie.\n\nSo when Elsa spoke to him and asked him that one straight and firm\nquestion, he raised his head and looked straight into her tear-dimmed\neyes.\n\n\"What, Elsa?\" he asked quietly.\n\n\"That you let B\u00c3\u00a9la go to his death--just like that--as Klara said .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nthat is not all true, is it?\"\n\nAnd as she returned his look--fearlessly and trustfully--she knew that\nthe question which she had thus put to him was really an affirmation of\nwhat she felt must be the truth. But already Andor had raised his voice\nin hot and passionate protest.\n\n\"He was a brute to you, Elsa,\" he affirmed with all the strength of his\nmanhood, the power of his love, which, in spite of all, would not\nbelieve in its own misery; \"he would have made you wretchedly unhappy\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. he .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"You did do it, then?\" she broke in quietly.\n\n\"I did it because of you, Elsa,\" he cried, and his own firm voice was\nnow half-choked with sobs. \"He made you unhappy even though you were not\nyet bound to him by marriage. Once you were his wife he would have made\nyou miserable .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. he would have bullied you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. beaten you, perhaps.\nI heard him out under the verandah speaking to you like the sneering\nbrute that he was. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. And then he kissed you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and I .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. But\neven then I didn't give him the key. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Klara lied when she said\nthat. I didn't urge him to take it, even--I did not speak about the key.\nIt was lying on the table where I had put it--he took it up--I did not\ngive it him.\"\n\n\"But you let him take it. You knew that he meant to visit Klara, and\nthat Leopold was on the watch outside. Yet you let him go. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"I let him go. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I was nearly mad then with rage at the way he had\ntreated you all day. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. His taking that key was a last insult put\nupon you on the eve of your wedding day. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. The thought of it got\ninto my blood like fire, when I saw his cruel leer and heard his sneers.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Later on, I thought better of it .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. calmer thoughts had got\ninto my brain .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. reason, sober sense. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I had gone back to the\npresbytery, and meant to go to bed--I went out, I swear it by God that\nI went out prepared to warn him, to help him if I could. The whole\nvillage was deserted, it was the hour of supper at the barn. I heard the\nchurch clock strike the half-hour after ten. I worked my way round to\nthe back of Goldstein's house and in the yard I saw B\u00c3\u00a9la lying--dead.\"\n\n\"And you might have raised a finger to save him at first .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and you\ndidn't do it.\"\n\n\"Not at first .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and after that it was too late. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"You have done a big, big wrong, Andor,\" she said slowly.\n\n\"Wrong?\" he cried, whilst once more the old spirit of defiance fired\nhim--the burning love in him, the wrath at seeing her unhappy. \"Wrong?\nBecause I did not prevent one miserable brute being put out of the way\nof doing further harm? By the living God, Elsa, I do not believe that it\nwas wrong. I didn't send him to his death, I did not see or speak to\nLeopold Hirsch, I merely let Fate or God Himself work His way with him.\nI did not say a word to him that might have induced him to take that\nkey. He picked it up from the table, and every evil thought came into\nhis head then and there. He didn't even care about Klara and a silly,\nswaggering flirtation with her, he only wanted to insult you, to shame\nyou, to show you that he was the master--and meant to have his way in\nall things. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. And this he did because--bar his pride in your\nbeauty--he really hated you and meant to treat you ill. He meant to harm\nyou, Elsa--my own dear dove .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. my angel from heaven .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. for whom I\nwould have died, and would die to-day, if my death could bring you\nhappiness. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I let him go and Leopold Hirsch killed him .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. if he\nhad lived, he would have made your life one long misery. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Was it my\nfault that Leopold Hirsch killed him?--killed him at the moment when he\nwas trying to do you as great harm as he could? By God, Elsa, I swear\nthat I don't believe it was my fault .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. it was the will of God--God\nwould not punish me for not interfering with His will. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Why, it\nwouldn't be justice, Elsa .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. it wouldn't be justice.\"\n\nHis voice broke in one agonized sob. He had put all his heart, all his\nfeelings into that passionate appeal. He did not believe that he had\ndone wrong, he had not on his soul the sense of the brand of Cain.\nRough, untutored, a son of the soil, he saw no harm in sweeping out of\nthe way a noisome creature who spreads evil and misery. And Elsa's was\nalso a simple and untutored soul, even though in her calmer temperament\nthe wilder passions of men had found no echo. True and steadfast in\nlove, her mind was too simple to grasp at sophistry, to argue about\nright or wrong; her feelings were her guide, and even while\nAndor--burning with love and impatience--argued and clung desperately to\nhis own point of view, she felt only the desire to comfort and to\nsuccour--above all, to love--she was just a girl--Andor's sweetheart and\nnot his judge. God alone was that! God would punish if He so\ndesired--indeed, He had punished already, for never had such sorrow\ndescended in Andor's heart before, of that she felt quite sure.\n\nHe became quite calm after awhile. Even his passion seemed to have died\ndown under the weight of this immense sorrow.\n\nAnd the peace which comes from the plains when they are wrapped in the\ndarkness of the night descended on the humble peasant-girl's soul; she\nsaw things as they really were, not as men's turbulent desires would\nhave them be--above all, not as a woman's idealism would picture them.\n\nShe no longer had the desire to run away--and if the distant, unknown\nland was to wrap and enfold her out of the ken of this real, cruel\nworld, then it should enfold her and Andor together, and her love would\nwrap him and comfort him too.\n\nSo now--when he had finished speaking, when his fervent appeal to God\nand to her had died down on his quivering lips--she came close up to him\nand placed her small, cool hand upon his arm.\n\n\"Andor,\" she said gently; and her voice shook and was almost\nundistinguishable from the sweet, soft sounds that filled the limitless\nplain. \"I am only an ignorant peasant-girl--you and I are only like\nchildren, of course, beside the clever people who can argue about such\nthings. But this I do know, that there is no sin in the world so great\nbut it can be blotted out and forgiven. You may have done a big, big,\nwrong, Andor--or perhaps you are not much to blame .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I don't know\nhow that is .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Pater Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius will tell you, no doubt, when next\nyou make your confession to him. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. But I am too ignorant to\nunderstand .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. the plains have taught me all I know .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nand .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I shall always love you, Andor .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and not judge what you\nhave done. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. God will do that. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I can only love you. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. That\nis all!\"\n\nHer voice died away in the soughing of the wind. For a moment or two he\nstood beside her--not daring to speak--or to move--or to take that cool,\nlittle white hand in his and kiss it--for now she seemed to him more\npure than she had ever been--almost holy--like a saint--hallowed by the\nperfect selflessness of her love.\n\nAnd as he stood beside her--with head bent and throat choked with sobs\nof infinite happiness--the darkness of the night fell wholly upon the\nplain. Nothing around but just this darkness, filled with all the sounds\nof hidden, pulsating life; overhead the clouds chased one another\nceaselessly and restlessly, and from far away the dull murmur of the\nwater came as a faint and rumbling echo.\n\nAndor could no longer see Elsa now, not even her silhouette; but her\nhand was still on his arm, and he felt the nearness of her presence, and\nknew that henceforth, throughout the years that were to come, a\nhappiness such as he had never even dared to dream of would be his and\nhers too, until the day when they would leave the beautiful, mysterious\nplains for that hidden land beyond the glowing horizon, beyond the rosy\ndawn and the crimson sunset.\n\nAndor slowly fell on his knees and pressed his burning lips on the\nsmall, white hand. Just then in the east there was a rent in the clouds,\na lining of silver appeared behind the darkness; the rent became wider\nand ever wider; the silver turned to lemon-gold, and slowly,\nmajestically, the waning moon--honey-coloured and brilliant--emerged\ntriumphantly, queening it over the plain.\n\nThe silvery radiance lit up the vast, silent expanse of nothingness, the\nhuge dome of the sky, the limitless area of stubble and stumps of hemp\nand dead sunflowers, and where the mysteries of the earth merged in\nthose of the sky--it touched with its subtle radiance that unknown land\non the horizon, far away, which no child of the plain has ever reached\nas yet.\n\nAnd from the distant village came softly sounding the tinkle of the\nchurch bell, tolling for evening prayer.\n\nHand in hand, Andor and Elsa wandered back to the\nvillage--together--hand in hand with memory--hand in hand in\nnever-fading love and understanding and simple trust--hand in hand upon\nthe bosom of the illimitable plain.\n\n\n\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's note:\n\nSome names were spelled inconsistently in the original text.\nAll occurrences of \"Benko\" have been corrected to \"Benk\u00c3\u00b3\",\n\"Bonifacius\" has been corrected to \"Bonif\u00c3\u00a1cius\", and \"Hoh\u00c3\u00a9r\"\nhas been corrected to \"H\u00c3\u00b3h\u00c3\u00a9r\".\n\nIn addition, the following typographical errors have been\ncorrected.\n\n   In Chapter XX, \"violent and suddent\" was changed to\n   \"violent and sudden\".\n\n   In Chapter XXI, \"wont .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. won't you sit down?\" was\n   changed to \"won't .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. won't you sit down?\"\n\n   In Chapter XXV, \"make Andor giddy\" was changed to \"made\n   Andor giddy\".\n\n   In Chapter XXVIII, a missing period was added after\n    \"quietly laid to rest\".\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A BRIDE OF THE PLAINS***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 29106-8.txt or 29106-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/2\/9\/1\/0\/29106\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":978,"split":"train"}
