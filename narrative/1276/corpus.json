{"ori_id":"7ee7a5656b920c8b6e33cc3f970afa9501782393","title":"Border, Breed nor Birth","context":"Border, Breed nor Birth\n During his meeting in Dakar with the head of the Reunited Nations African Development Project, Dr. Homer Crawford resigns his post as leader of the Sahara Division team to become El Hassan, the liberator and would-be tyrant of North Africa. Threatened with arrest, Crawford and his followers hide in the Sahara erg. They intercept news that the Arab Union has occupied Tamanrasset, ostensibly to protect the region against El Hassan rioters. Crawford decides to recapture Tamanrasset and use its communications system to proclaim his regime. To do so, he sends his followers to organize troops from nearby regions: the Teda from the east, the Chaambra from the north, the Sudanese from the south, and the Nemadi, Moors, and Rifs from the West. Crawford, Isobel Cunningham, and Cliff Jackson will establish the movement's headquarters in Tuareg country. They are all to rendezvous at Tamanrasset in two weeks.\nCrawford wins the loyalty of the Tuareg warriors by offering to make them the core of El Hassan\u2019s Desert Legion during wartime and his policemen and rangers during peacetime. Rex Donaldson, ex-field expert for the African Department of the British Commonwealth, arrives to join Crawford's organization, bringing fieldworkers Jack and Jimmy Peters and David Moroka with him. As they are being briefed, David thwarts an assassination attempt against Crawford, killing the assassin. Crawford then sends Rex to recruit troops in Senegal and Mali. Now guarded by fifteen Tuareg warriors, Crawford\u2019s group travels the country to rally up forces for the upcoming Tamanrasset battle. They capture Dr. Warren Harding Smythe's American Medical Relief team and force them to join the group. As Crawford's team puts together El Hassan\u2019s government, Jack proposes that they make Esperanto the common language of the movement. Kenny Ballalou arrives from the West with news: several Reunited Nations development teams have joined El Hassan, so he now controls a large portion of North Africa. As El Hassan's influence grows, so does his camp, which fills with reporters and foreign diplomats anxious to meet him.\nCrawford's group decides to use guerrilla tactics to disable the mechanized army of the Arab Union. They are reprieved from air attack temporarily when the Reunited Nations announces retaliation against any power that uses air combat. Meanwhile, David, who in reality is a Party member of the Soviet Complex, radios his superiors, revealing that he engineered the attempted assassination of Crawford to earn his trust. C.I.A. agent Fred Ostrander arrives at the camp to remind Crawford of his allegiance to the United States and the West, but Crawford responds that he is an African looking for African solutions to African problems. When Ostrander challenges Crawford to explain why he is the man to lead North Africa, Crawford responds that he was thrust into the job. He then expresses deep regret that becoming El Hassan led him to kill his best friend, Abe, who wanted him to swear allegiance to the Soviet Complex. Crawford's confession disarms David, whose spying has been fueled by a desire to revenge Abe.\nIsobel surprises David as he is reporting to his superiors, but when confronted by the team, David claims he has resigned from the Party and is now an El Hassan man. He also informs them that the Arab Union is planning to parachute troopers into various points of the Sahara. Ostrander, who has decided to join El Hassan's team as well, earns them some time by telling the commander of the Arab legion that the United States will send its own air force to aid El Hassan if the paratroopers are deployed. As everyone arms for battle, David and Ostrander have one last conversation, in which they insist that their long-term socioeconomical views have not changed, but that both believe African union takes precedence for the moment. They wish each other well during the coming fight.\nDuring the aftermath of the successful recapture of Tamanrasset, Crawford finds that Jack, David, and Ostrander are dead and that Kenny has been seriously hurt. He then receives good news and bad news: foreign countries and organizations have begun to recognize El Hassan as the legal head of North Africa; Elmer Allen has been captured by one of Crawford's enemies, the leader of the Ouled Touameur clan, Abd-el-Kader. To make matters worse, Abd-el-Kader now claims to be the reincarnation of the Mahdi, the holiest prophet since Mohammed, so that he can call on a holy war against El Hassan.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's Border, Breed Nor Birth, by Dallas McCord Reynolds\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Arrayed against him and his dream, he knew,\nwas the combined power of the world in the form of the Reunited\nNations, and, in addition, such individual powers as the United States\nof the Americas, the Soviet Complex, Common Europe, the French\nCommunity, the British Commonwealth and the Arab Union, working both\ntogether and unilaterally.\n\nImmediate survival depended upon getting into the Great Erg of the\nSahara where even the greatest powers the world had ever developed\nwould have their work cut out locating El Hassan and his people.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBey-ag-Akhamouk who was riding next to Elmer Allen in the lead air\ncushion hover-lorry, held a hand high. Both of the solar powered\ndesert vehicles ground to a halt.\n\nHomer Crawford vaulted out of the seat of the second lorry before it\nhad settled to the sand. \"What's up, Bey?\" he called.\n\nBey pointed to the south and west. They were in the vicinity of\nTessalit, in what was once known as French Sudan, and immediately to\nthe south of Algeria. They were deliberately avoiding what little\nexisted in this area in the way of trails, the Tanezrouft route which\ncrossed the Sahara from Colomb-B\u00c3\u00a9char to Gao, on the Niger, was some\nfifty miles to the west.\n\nHomer Crawford stared up into the sky in the direction Bey pointed and\nhis face went wan.\n\nThe others were piling out of the vehicles.\n\n\"What is it?\" Isobel Cunningham said, squinting and trying to catch\nwhat the others had already spotted.\n\n\"Aircraft,\" Bey growled. \"A rocket-plane.\"\n\n\"Which means the military in this part of the world,\" Homer said.\n\nThe rest of them looked to him for instructions, but Bey suddenly took\nover. He said to Homer, \"You better get on over beneath that\noutcropping of rock. The rest of us will handle this.\"\n\nHomer looked at him.\n\nBey said, flatly, \"If one of the rest of us gets it, or even if all of\nus do, the El Hassan movement goes on. But if something happens to\nyou, the movement dies. We've already taken our stand and too much is\nat stake to risk your life.\"\n\nHomer Crawford opened his mouth to protest, then closed it. He reached\ninside the solar-powered lorry and fetched forth a Tommy-Noiseless and\nstarted for the rock outcropping at a trot. Having made his decision,\nhe wasn't going to cramp Bey-ag-Akhamouk's style with needless\npalaver.\n\nIsobel Cunningham, Cliff Jackson, Elmer Allen and Kenny Ballalou\ngathered around the tall, American educated Tuareg.\n\n\"What's the plan?\" Elmer said. Either he or Kenny Ballalou could have\ntaken over as competently, but they were as capable of taking orders\nas giving them, a desirable trait in fighting men.\n\nBey was still staring at the oncoming speck. He growled, \"We can't\neven hope he hasn't seen the pillars of sand and dust these vehicles\nthrow up. He's spotted us all right. And we've got to figure he's\nlooking for us, even though we can hope he's not.\"\n\nThe side of his mouth began to tic, characteristically. \"He'll make\nthree passes. The first one high, as an initial check. The second time\nhe'll come in low just to make sure. The third pass and he'll clobber\nus.\"\n\nThe aircraft was coming on, high but nearer now.\n\n\"So,\" Elmer said reasonably, \"we either get him the second pass he\nmakes, or we've had it.\" The young Jamaican's lips were thinned back\nover his excellent teeth, as always when he went into combat.\n\n\"That's it,\" Bey agreed. \"Kenny, you and Cliff get the flac rifle, and\nhave it handy in the back of the second truck. Be sure he doesn't see\nit on this first pass. Elmer, get on the radio and check anything he\nsends.\"\n\nKenny Ballalou and the hulking Cliff Jackson ran to carry out orders.\n\nIsobel said, \"Got an extra gun for me?\"\n\nBey scowled at her. \"You better get over there with Homer where it's\nsafer.\"\n\nShe said evenly, \"I've always considered myself a pacifist, but when\nsomebody starts shooting at me, I forget about it and am inclined to\nshoot back.\"\n\n\"I haven't got time to argue with you,\" Bey said. \"There aren't any\nextra guns except handguns and they'd be useless.\" As he spoke, he\npulled his own Tommy-Noiseless from its scabbard on the front door of\nthe air cushion lorry, and checked its clip of two hundred .10 caliber\nultra-high velocity rounds. He flicked the selector to the explosive\nside of the clip.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe plane was roaring in on what would be its first pass, if Bey had\nguessed correctly. If he had guessed incorrectly, this might be the\nend. A charge of napalm would fry everything for a quarter of a mile\naround, or the craft might even be equipped with a mini-fission bomb.\nIn this area a minor nuclear explosion would probably go undetected.\n\nBey yelled, \"Don't anybody even try to fire at him at this range.\nHe'll be back. It takes half the sky to turn around in with that\ncrate, but he'll be back, lower next time.\"\n\nCliff Jackson said cheerlessly, \"Maybe he's just looking for us. He\nwon't necessarily take a crack at us.\"\n\nBey grunted. \"Elmer?\"\n\n\"Nothing on the radio,\" Elmer said. \"If he was just scouting us out,\nhe'd report to his base. But if his orders are to clobber us, then he\nwouldn't put it on the air.\"\n\nThe plane was turning in the sky, coming back.\n\nCliff argued, \"Well, we can't fire unless we know if he's just hunting\nus out, or trying to do us in.\"\n\nElmer said patiently, \"For just finding us, that first pass would be\nall he needed. He could radio back that he'd found us. But if he comes\nin again, he's looking for trouble.\"\n\n\"Here he comes!\" Bey yelled. \"Kenny-Cliff ... the rifle!\"\n\nIsobel suddenly dashed out into the sands a dozen yards or so from the\nvehicles and began running around and around in a circle as though\ndemented.\n\nBey stared at her. \"Get back here,\" he roared. \"Under one of the\ntrucks!\"\n\nShe ignored him.\n\nThe rocket-plane was coming in, low and obviously as slow as the pilot\ncould retard its speed.\n\nThe flac rifle began jumping and tracers reached out from\nit--inaccurately. The Tommy-Noiseless automatics in the hands of Bey\nand Elmer Allen gave their silenced _flic flic flic_ sounds, equally\nineffective.\n\nOn the ultra-stubby wings of the fast moving aircraft, a row of\nbrilliant cherries flickered and a row of explosive shells plowed\nacross the desert, digging twin ditches, miraculously going between\nthe air cushion lorries but missing both. It was upon them, over and\ngone, before the men on the ground could turn to fire after.\n\nElmer Allen muttered an obscenity under his breath.\n\nCliff Jackson looked around in desperation. \"What can we do now? He\nwon't come close enough for us to even fire at him, next time.\"\n\nBey said nothing. Isobel had collapsed into the sand. Elmer Allen\nlooked over at her. \"Nice try, Isobel,\" he said. \"I think he came in\nlower and slower than he would have otherwise--trying to see what the\ndevil it was you were doing.\"\n\nShe shrugged, hopelessly.\n\n\"Hey!\" Kenny Ballalou pointed.\n\nThe rocketcraft was wobbling, shuddering, in the sky. Suddenly it\nburst into a black cloud of fire and smoke and explosion.\n\nAt the same moment, Homer Crawford got up from the sand dune behind\nwhich he'd stationed himself and plowed awkwardly through the sand\ntoward them.\n\nBey glared at him.\n\nHomer shrugged and said, \"I checked the way he came in the first time\nand figured he'd repeat the run. Then I got behind that dune there and\nfaced in the other direction and started firing where I _thought_ he'd\nbe, a few seconds before he came over. He evidently ran right into\nit.\"\n\nBey said indignantly, \"Look, wise guy, you're no longer the leader of\na five-man Reunited Nations African Development Project team. Then,\nyou were expendable. Now, you're El Hassan. You give the orders. Other\npeople are expendable.\"\n\nHomer Crawford grinned at him, somewhat ruefully and held up his hands\nas though in supplication. \"Listen to the man, is that any way to talk\nto El Hassan?\"\n\nElmer Allen said worriedly, \"He's right, though, Homer. You shouldn't\ntake chances.\"\n\nHomer Crawford went serious. \"Actually, none of us should, if we can\navoid it. In a way, El Hassan isn't one person. It's this team here,\nand Jake Armstrong, who by this time I hope is on his way to the\nStates.\"\n\nBey was shaking his head in stubborn determination. \"No,\" he said.\n\"I'm not sure that you comprehend this yourself, Homer, but you're\nNumber One. You're the symbol, the hero these people are going to\nfollow if we put this thing over. They couldn't understand a sextet\nleadership. They want a leader, someone to dominate and tell them what\nto do. A team you need, admittedly, but not so much as the team needs\nyou. Remember Alexander? He had a team starting off with Aristotle for\na brain-trust, and Parmenion, one of the greatest generals of all time\nfor his right-hand man. Then he had a group of field men such as\nPtolemy, Antipater, Antigonus and Seleucus--not to be rivaled until\nNapoleon built his team, two thousand years later. And what happened\nto this super-team when Alexander died?\"\n\nHomer looked at him thoughtfully.\n\nBey wound it up doggedly. \"You're our Alexander. Our Caesar. Our\nNapoleon. So don't go getting yourself killed, damn it. Excuse me,\nIsobel.\"\n\nIsobel grinned her pixielike grin. \"I agree,\" she said. \"Dammit.\"\n\nHomer said, \"I'm not sure I go all along with you or not. We'll think\nabout it.\" His voice took a sharper note. \"Let's go over and see if\nthere's enough left in that wreckage to give us an idea of who the\npilot represented. I can't believe it was a Reunited Nations man, and\nI'd like to know who, of our potential enemies, dislikes the idea of\nEl Hassan so much that they figure we should all be bumped off before\nwe even get under way.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt had begun--if there is ever a beginning--in Dakar. In the offices\nof Sven Zetterberg the Swedish head of the Sahara Division of the\nAfrican Development Project of the Reunited Nations.\n\nHomer Crawford, head of a five-man trouble-shooting team, had reported\nfor orders. In one hand he held them, when he was ushered into the\nother's presence.\n\nZetterberg shook hands abruptly, said, \"Sit down, Dr. Crawford.\"\n\nHomer Crawford looked at the secretary who had ushered him in.\n\nZetterberg said, scowling, \"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"I think I have something to be discussed privately.\"\n\nThe secretary shrugged and turned and left.\n\nZetterberg, still scowling, resumed his own place behind the desk and\nsaid, \"Claud Hansen is a trusted Reunited Nations man. What could\npossibly be so secret...?\"\n\nHomer indicated the orders he held. \"This assignment. It takes some\nconsideration.\"\n\nSven Zetterberg was not a patient man. He said, in irritation, \"It\nshould be perfectly clear. This El Hassan we've been hearing so much\nabout. This mystery man come out of the desert attempting to unify\nall North America. We want to talk to him.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Crawford said.\n\n\"Confound it,\" Zetterberg snapped. \"I thought we'd gone into this\nyesterday. In spite of the complaints that come into this office in\nregard to your cavalier tactics in carrying out your assignments, you\nand your team are our most competent operatives. So we've given you\nthe assignment of finding El Hassan.\"\n\n\"I mean, why do you want to talk to him?\"\n\nThe Swede glared at him for a moment, as though the American was being\ndeliberately dense. \"Dr. Crawford,\" he said, \"when the African\nDevelopment Project was first begun we had high hopes. Seemingly all\nReunited Nations members were being motivated by high humanitarian\nreasons. Our task was to bring all Africa to a level of progress\ncomparable to the advanced nations. It was more than a duty, it was a\ncrying need, a demand. Africa is and has been throughout history a\n_have-not_ continent. While Europe, the Americas, Australia and now\neven Asia, industrialized and largely conquered man's old\nsocio-economic problems, Africa lagged behind. The reasons were\nmanifold, colonialism, lingering tribal society ... various others.\nNow that very lagging has become a potential explosive situation. With\nthe coming of antibiotics and other break-throughs in medicine, the\nAfrican population is growing with an all but geometric progression.\nSo fast is it growing, that what advances were being made did less\nthan keep up the level of per capita gross product. It was bad enough\nto have a per capita gross product averaging less than a hundred\ndollars a year, but it actually sank below that point.\"\n\nHomer Crawford was nodding.\n\nZetterberg continued the basic lecture with which he knew the other\nwas already completely familiar. \"So the Reunited Nations took on the\ntask of advancing as rapidly as possible the African economy and all\nthe things that must be done before an economy _can_ be advanced. It\nwas self-preservation, I suppose. _Have-not_ nations, not to speak of\n_have-not_ races and _have-not_ continents, have a tendency eventually\nto explode upon their wealthier neighbors.\"\n\nThe Swede pressed his lips together before continuing. \"Unfortunately,\nthe Reunited Nations as the United Nations and the League of Nations\nbefore it, is composed of members each with its own irons in the fire.\nEach with its own plans and schemes.\" His voice was bitter now. \"The\nArab Union with its desire to unite all Islam into one. The Soviet\nComplex with its ultimate dream of a soviet world. The capitalistic\neconomies of the British Commonwealth, Common Europe, and your United\nStates of the Americas, with their hunger for, positive need for,\nsources of raw materials and markets for their manufactured products.\nAll, though playing lip service to the African Development Project,\nhave still their own ambitions.\"\n\nSven Zetterberg waggled a finger at Homer Crawford. \"I do not charge\nthat your United States is attempting to take over Africa, or even any\nsection of it, in the old colonialistic sense. Even England and France\nhave discovered that it is much simpler to dominate economically than\nto go through all the expense and effort of governing another people.\nThat is the basic reason they gave up their empires. No, your United\nStates would love to so dominate Africa that her products, her\nentrepreneurs, would flood the continent to the virtual exclusion of\nsuch economic competitors as Common Europe. The Commonwealth feels the\nsame, so does the French Community. The Soviets and Arabs have\ndifferent motivations, but they, too, wish to take over. The\nresult....\" The Swede tossed up his hands in a gesture more Gallic\nthan Scandinavian.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What has all this got to do with El Hassan?\" Homer Crawford asked\nsoftly.\n\nThe Swede leaned forward. \"If we more devoted adherents of the\nReunited Nations are ever to see our hopes come true, Africa must be\nunited and made strong. And this must be done through the efforts of\n_Africans_ not Russians, British, French, Arabs ... nor even\nScandinavians. Socio-economic changes should not, possibly cannot, be\ninflicted upon a people from without. Look at the mess the Russians\nmade in such countries as Hungary, or the Americans in such as South\nKorea.\"\n\n\"The people themselves must have the dream,\" Crawford said softly.\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Go on.\"\n\nZetterberg said, \"On the surface, great progress seems to be\ncontinuing. Afforestation of the Sahara, the solar pumps creating new\noases, the water purification plants on the Atlantic and\nMediterranean, pushing back the desert, the oil fields, the mines, the\nroads, the damming of the Niger. But already cracks can be seen. A\nweek or so ago, a team of Cubans, supposedly, at least, in the Sudan\nto improve sugar refining methods, were machine-gunned to death. By\nwhom? By the Sudanese? Unlikely. No, this Cuban massacre was one of\nmany recent signs of conflict between the great powers in their\nefforts to dominate. Our problem, of course, deals only with North\nAfrica, but I have heard rumors in Geneva that much the same situation\nis developing in the south as well.\"\n\n\"At any rate, Dr. Crawford, when the rumors of El Hassan began to come\ninto this office they brought with them a breath of hope. From all we\nhave heard, he teaches our basic program--a breaking down of old\ntribal society, education, economic progress, Pan-African unity. Dr.\nCrawford, no one with whom this office is connected seems ever to have\nseen this El Hassan but we are most anxious to talk to him. Perhaps\nthis is the man behind whom we can throw our support. Your task is to\nfind him.\"\n\nHomer Crawford raked the fingers of his right hand back over his\nshort wiry hair, and grimaced. He said, \"It won't be necessary.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Doctor?\"\n\nCrawford said, \"It won't be necessary to go looking for El Hassan.\"\n\nThe Swede scowled his irritation at the other. \"See here....\"\n\nCrawford said, \"I'm El Hassan.\"\n\nSven Zetterberg stared at him, uncomprehending.\n\nHomer Crawford said, \"I suppose it's your turn to listen and for me\nto do the talking.\" He shifted in his chair, uncomfortably. \"Dr.\nZetterberg, even before the Reunited Nations evolved the idea of the\nAfrican Development Project, it became obvious that the field work was\ngoing to have to be in the hands of Negroes. The reason is doublefold.\nFirst, the African doesn't trust the white man, for good reason.\nSecond, the white man is a citizen of his own country, first of all,\nand finds it difficult not to have motives connected with his own race\nand nation. But the African Negro, too, has his tribal and sometimes\nnational affiliations and cannot be trusted not to be prejudiced in\ntheir favor. The answer? The educated American Negro, such as myself.\"\n\n\"I haven't the slightest idea from whence came my ancestors, from what\npart of Africa, what tribe, what nation. But I am a Negro and ...\nwell, have the dream of bettering my race. I have no irons in the\nfire, beyond altruistic ones. Of course, when I say American Negroes I\ndon't exclude Canadian ones, or those of Latin America or the\nCaribbean. It is simply that there are greater numbers of educated\nAmerican Negroes than you find elsewhere.\"\n\nZetterberg said impatiently, \"Please, Dr. Crawford. Come to the point.\nThat ridiculous statement you made about El Hassan.\"\n\n\"Of course, I am merely giving background. Most of we field workers,\nnot only the African Development teams, but such organizations as the\nAfrica for Africans Association and the representatives of the African\nDepartment of the British Commonwealth, and of the French Community's\nAfrican Affairs sector, are composed of Negroes.\"\n\nZetterberg was nodding. \"All right, I know.\"\n\nHomer Crawford said, \"The teams of all these organizations do their\nbest to spur African progress, in our case, in North Africa,\nespecially the area between the Niger and the Mediterranean. Often we\ndisguise ourselves as natives since in that manner we are more quickly\ntrusted. We wear the clothes, speak the local language or lingua\nfranca.\"\n\nThe American hesitated a moment, then plunged in. \"Dr. Zetterberg, the\nAfrican is still a primitive but newly beginning to move out of a\ntradition-ritual-taboo tribal society. He seeks a hero to follow, a\nman of towering prestige who knows the answers to all questions. We\nmay not _like_ this fact, we with our traditions of democracy, but it\nis so. The African is simply not yet at that stage of society where\npolitical democracy is applicable.\"\n\n\"My team does most of its work posing as Enaden--low caste itinerant\nsmiths of the Sahara. As such we can go any place and are everywhere\naccepted, a necessary sector of the Saharan economy. As such, we\ncontinually spread the ... ah, propaganda of the Reunited Nations--the\nneed for education, the need for taking jobs on the new projects, the\nneed for casting aside old institutions and embracing the new. Early\nin the game we found our words had little weight coming from simple\nEnaden smiths so we ... well, _invented_ this mysterious El Hassan,\nand everything we said we attributed to him.\"\n\n\"News spreads fast in the desert, astonishingly fast. El Hassan\nstarted with us but soon other teams, hearing about him and realizing\nthat his message was the same as that they were trying to propagate,\ndid the same thing. That is, attributed the messages they had to\nspread to El Hassan. It was amusing when a group of us got together\nlast week in Timbuktu, to find that we'd all taken to kowtowing to\nthis mythical desert hero who planned to unite all North Africa.\"\n\nThe Swede was staring at him unbelievingly. \"But, a bit earlier you\nsaid you were El Hassan.\"\n\nHomer Crawford looked into his chief's face and nodded seriously.\n\"I've been conferring with various other field workers, both Reunited\nNations and otherwise. The situation calls for a real El Hassan. If we\ndon't provide him, someone else will. I propose to take over the\nposition.\"\n\nSven Zetterberg's face was suddenly cold. \"And why, Dr. Crawford, do\nyou think you are more qualified than others?\"\n\nThe American Negro could hardly fail to note the other's disapproval.\nHe said evenly, but definitely, \"Through experience. Through\neducation. Through ... through having the dream, Dr. Zetterberg.\"\n\n\"The Reunited Nations cannot support such a project, Dr. Crawford. I\nabsolutely forbid you to consider it.\"\n\n\"Forbid me?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was as though a strange something entered the atmosphere of the\nroom, almost as though a new _presence_ was there. And almost, it\nseemed to Sven Zetterberg, that the already tall, solidly built man\nacross from him grew physically as his voice seemed to swell, to reach\nout, to dominate. There was a new, and all but unbelievable Homer\nCrawford here.\n\nThe Swedish official regathered his forces. This was ridiculous. He\nsaid again, \"I forbid you to....\" the sentence dribbled away under the\ncold disdain in the air now.\n\nHomer Crawford said flatly, \"You don't seem to understand, Zetterberg.\nThe Reunited Nations has no control over El Hassan. Homer Crawford, as\nof this meeting, has resigned his post with the African Development\nProject. And El Hassan has begun his task of uniting all North\nAfrica.\"\n\nSven Zetterberg, shaken by this new and unsuspected force the other\nseemed to be able to bring to his command, fought back. \"It will be\nsimple to discredit you, to let it be known that you are no more than\nan ambitious American out to seize power illegally.\"\n\nCrawford's scorn held an element of amusement. \"Try it. I suspect your\nattempts to discredit El Hassan will prove unsuccessful. He has\nalready been rumored to be everything from an Ethiopian to the Second\nComing of the Messiah. Your attempt to brand him an American\nadventurer will be swallowed up in the flood of other rumor.\"\n\nThe Swede was still shaken by the strange manner in which his once\nsubordinate had suddenly dominated him. Sven Zetterberg was not a man\nto be dominated, to be made unsure.\n\nTime folded back on itself and for a moment he was again a lad and on\nvacation with his father in Bavaria. They were having lunch in the\nfamed Hofbra\u00c3\u00bchaus, largest of the Munich beercellars, and even a\nten-year-old could sense an anticipation in the air, particularly\namong the large number of brownshirted men who had gathered to one\nside of the ground level of the beer hall. His father was telling Sven\nof the history of the medieval building when a silence fell. Into the\nbeer hall had come a pasty faced, trenchcoat garbed little man, his\nface set in stern lines but insufficiently to offset the ludicrous\nmustache. He was accompanied by an elderly soldier in the uniform of a\nField Marshal, by a large tub of a man whose face beamed--but\nevilly--and by a pinch faced cripple. All were men of command, all\nexcept the pasty faced one, to whom they seemingly and surprisingly,\ndeferred. And then he stood on a heavy chair and spoke. And then his\n_power_ reached out and grasped all within reach of his shrill voice.\nGrasped them and compelled them and they became a shouting, red faced,\narm brandishing mob, demanding to be led to glory. And Sven's father\nhad bustled the shocked boy from the building.\n\nIt came back to him now, clearly and forcefully, and he realized that\nwhatever it was with which the Beast of Berchtesgaden had enchanted\nhis people, that power was on call in Homer Crawford. Whether he used\nit for good or evil, that enchanting power was on call. And again Sven\nZetterberg was shaken.\n\nHomer Crawford was on his feet, preparatory to leaving.\n\nThe Swede simply _had_ to reassert himself. \"Dr. Crawford, the\nReunited Nations is not without resources. You'll be arrested before\nyou leave Dakar.\"\n\nAn element of the tenseness left the air when Crawford smiled and\nsaid, \"Doctor, for several years now I have been playing hide and seek\nin the Sahara, doing your work. You mentioned earlier that my team is\nthe most experienced and capable. Just whom are you going to send to\npick me up? Members of some of the other teams? Old friends and\ncomrades in arms. Many of whom owe their lives to my team when all\nbets were down. Please do send them, Doctor, I am going to need\nrecruits.\"\n\nHe swung and left the office and even as he went could hear the angry\nReunited Nations chief blasting into an interoffice communicator. He\ndecided he'd better see if there wasn't a back door or window through\nwhich to leave the building. He'd have to phone Bey, Isobel and the\nothers and get together for a meeting to plan developments. El Hassan\nwas getting off to a fast start, already he was on the lam.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHomer Crawford played it safe. From the nearest public phone he called\nIsobel Cunningham at the Hotel Juan-le-Pin. No matter how fast Sven\nZetterberg swung into action, it would take his operatives some time\nto connect Isobel with Homer and his team. As an employee of the\nAfrica for Africans Association, she would ordinarily come in little\ncontact with the Reunited Nations teams.\n\nHe said, \"Isobel? Homer here. Can you talk?\"\n\nShe said, \"Cliff and Jake are here.\"\n\nHe said, \"Have you sounded them out? How do they feel about the El\nHassan project?\"\n\n\"They're in. At least, Jake is. We're still arguing with Cliff.\"\n\n\"O.K. Now listen, carefully. Zetterberg turned thumbs down on the\nwhole deal, for various reasons we can discuss later. In fact, he's\nincensed and threatened to take steps to keep us from leaving Dakar.\"\n\nIsobel was alerted but she snorted deprecation. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"They're probably already looking for me, and in a matter of minutes\nwill probably try to pick up Bey-ag-Akhamouk, Elmer Allen and Kenny\nBallalou, the other members of my team. Get in touch with them\nimmediately and tell them to get into native costume and into hiding.\nYou and Jake--and Cliff--do the same.\"\n\n\"Right. Where do we meet and when?\"\n\n\"In the _souk_, in the food market. There's a native restaurant there,\nrun by a former Vietnamese. We'll meet there at approximately noon.\"\n\n\"Right. Anything else?\"\n\nHomer said, \"Tell Bey to bring along an extra 9mm Recoilless for me.\"\n\n\"Yes, El Hassan,\" she said, her voice expressionless. She didn't waste\ntime. Homer Crawford heard the phone click as she hung up.\n\nHe was in a branch building of the post and telegraph network on the\nRue des Resistance. Before leaving it, he looked out a window. Half a\nblock away was the office of the Sahara Division of the African\nDevelopment Project. Even as he watched, a dozen men hurried out the\nfront door, fanned out in all directions.\n\nHomer grinned sourly. Old Sven was moving fast.\n\nHe shot a quick glance around the lobby of the building. He had to get\ngoing. Zetterberg had started with a dozen men to trail down El\nHassan. He'd probably have a hundred involved before the hour was out.\n\nA corridor turned off to the right. Homer hurried down it. At each\ndoor he looked inside. To whoever occupied the room he murmured a few\nwords of apology in Wolof, the Sengalese lingua franca. The fourth\noffice was empty.\n\nHomer stood there before it for a long, agonizing moment, waiting for\nthe right person to pass. Finally, the man he needed came along.\nAbout six feet tall, about a hundred and eighty; dressed in the local\nnative dress and on the ragged side.\n\nHomer said to him authoritatively, in the Wolof tongue, \"You there,\ncome in here!\" He opened the door, and pointed into the office.\n\nThe other, taken aback, demurred.\n\nHomer's face and tone went still more commanding. \"Step in here,\nbefore I call the police.\"\n\nIt was all a mistake, of course. The Senegalese made the gesture\nequivalent to the European's shrug, and entered the office.\n\nHomer came in behind him, closed the door. He wasted no time in\npreliminaries. Before the native turned, the American's hand lashed\nout in a karate blow which stunned the other. Homer Crawford caught\nhim, even as he fell, and lowered him gently to the floor.\n\n\"Sorry, old boy,\" he muttered, \"but this is probably the most\nprofitable thing that's happened to you this year.\"\n\nHe stripped off the other's clothes, as rapidly as he could make his\nhands fly. The other was still out and probably would be for another\nten minutes, Crawford estimated. He stripped off his own clothes and\ndonned the native's.\n\nLast of all, he took his wallet from his pocket, divided the money it\ncontained and stuffed a considerable wad of it into the European\nclothing he was abandoning.\n\n\"Don't spend all of that in one place,\" he growled softly.\n\nHomer dragged the other to a side of the room so that the body could\nnot be spotted from the entrance. Then he crossed to the door, opened\nit and stepped into the corridor beyond.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was no need for sulking. He walked out the front door and headed\naway from the dock and administration buildings area and toward the\nnative section, passing the Reunited Nations building on the way.\n\nDakar teems with multitudes of a dozen tribes come in from the jungles\nand the bush, the desert and the swamp areas of the sources of the\nNiger, to look for work on the new projects, to visit relatives, to\nmarket for the products of civilization--or to gawk. Homer Crawford\ndisappeared into them. One among many.\n\nToward noon, he entered the cleared area which was the restaurant he\nhad named to Isobel and squatted before the pots to the far end of the\nVietnamese owned eatery, examining them with care. He chose a large\nchunk of barbequed goat and was served it with a half pound piece of\nunsalted Senegalese bread, torn from a monstrous loaf, and a twisted\npiece of newspaper into which had been measured an ounce or so of\ncoarse salt. He took his meal and went to as secluded a corner as he\ncould find.\n\nHomer Crawford chuckled inwardly. That morning he had breakfasted in\nthe most swank hotel in West Africa. He wished there was some manner\nin which he could have invited Sven Zetterberg to dine here with him.\nOr, come to think of it, a group of the students he had once taught\nsociology at the University of Michigan. Or, possibly, prexy\nWallington, under whom he had worked while taking his doctor's degree.\n\nYes, it would have been interesting to have had a luncheon companion.\n\nA native woman, on the stoutish side but with her hair done up in one\nof the fabulously ornate hair styles specialized in by the Senegalese,\nand wearing a flowing, shapeless dress of the garish textiles run off\npurposely for this market in Japan and Manchester, waddled up to take\na place nearby. She bore a huge skewer of barbequed beef chunks, and a\nhunk of bread not unlike Homer's own.\n\nShe grumbled uncomfortably, her back to the American, as she settled\ninto a position on the floor. And she mumbled as she began chewing at\nthe meat.\n\n_No table manners_, Homer Crawford grinned inwardly. He wondered how\nlong it would take for the others to get here. He wasn't worried about\nIsobel, Cliff Jackson and Jake Armstrong. It would take time before\nZetterberg's Reunited Nations cloak and dagger boys got around to\nthem, but he wasn't sure that she'd be able to locate his own team in\ntime. That bit he'd given the Swede official about his being so\nbully-bully with the other Reunited Nations teams was in the way of\nbeing an exaggeration, with the idea of throwing the other off.\nActually, working in the field on definite assignments, it was seldom\nyou ran into other African Development Project men. But perhaps it\nwould tie Zetterberg up, wondering just who he could trust to send\nlooking for El Hassan.\n\nHe finished off his barbequed goat and the bread and wiped his hands\non his clothes. Nobody here yet. To have an excuse for staying, he\nwould have to buy a bottle of Gazelle beer, the cheap Senegalese brew\nwhich came in quart bottles and was warm and on the gassy side.\n\nIt was then that the woman in front of him, without turning, said\nsoftly, \"El Hassan?\"\n\n\nII\n\nHomer Crawford stared at her, unbelievingly. The woman couldn't\npossibly be an emissary from Isobel or from one of his own companions.\nThis situation demanded the utmost secrecy, they hadn't had time to\nscreen any outsiders as to trustworthiness.\n\nShe turned. It was Isobel. She chuckled softly, \"You should see your\nface.\"\n\nHis eyes went to her figure.\n\n\"Done with mirrors,\" Isobel said. \"Or, at least, with pillows.\"\n\nHomer didn't waste time. \"Where are the others? They should be here by\nnow.\"\n\n\"We figured that the fewer of us seen on the streets, the better. So\nthey're waiting for you. Since I was the most easily disguised, the\nleast suspicious looking, I was elected to come get you.\"\n\n\"Waiting where?\"\n\nShe licked the side of her mouth, a disconcerting characteristic of\nhers, and looked at him archly. \"Those pals of yours have quite a bit\non the ball on their own. They decided that there was a fairly good\nchance that Sven Zetterberg wasn't exactly going to fall into your\narms, so they took preliminary measures. Kenny Ballalou rented a small\nhouse, here in the native quarter. We've all rendezvoused there. See,\nyou aren't the only one on the ball.\"\n\nHomer frowned at her, for the moment being in no mood for humor. \"What\nwas the idea of sitting here for the past five minutes without even\nspeaking? You must have recognized me, knowing what to look for.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"I ... I wasn't sure, Homer, but I had the darnedest\nfeeling I was being followed.\"\n\nHis glance was sharp now. First at her, then a quick darting around\nthe vicinity. \"Woman's intuition,\" he snapped, \"or something\nsubstantial?\"\n\nShe frowned at him. \"I'm not a ninny, Homer.\"\n\nHis voice softened and he said quickly, \"Don't misunderstand, Isobel.\nI know that.\"\n\nShe forgot about her objection to his tone. \"Even intuition doesn't\ncome out of a clear sky. Something sparks it. Subconscious psi,\npossibly, but a spark.\"\n\n\"However?\" he prodded.\n\n\"I took all precautions. I can't seem to put my finger on anything.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" he said decisively. \"Let's go then.\" He came to his feet and\nreached a hand down for her.\n\n\"Heavens to Betsy,\" she said, \"don't do that.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Help a woman in public. You'll look suspicious.\" She came to her own\nfeet, without aid.\n\n_Damn_, he thought. She was right. The last thing he wanted was to\ndraw attention to a man who acted peculiarly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey made their way out of the food market and into the _souk_ proper,\nHomer walking three or four paces ahead of her, Isobel demurely\nbehind, her eyes on the ground. They passed the native stands and tiny\nshops, and the even smaller venders and hucksters with their products\nof the mass production industries of East and West, side by side with\nthe native handicrafts ranging from carved wooden statues, jewelry,\n_gris gris_ charms and kambu fetishes, to ceramics whose designs went\nback to an age before the Portuguese first cruised off this coast. And\neverywhere was color; there are no people on earth more color\nconscious than the Senegalese.\n\nIsobel guided him, her voice quiet and still maintaining its\nuncharacteristic demure quality.\n\nHe would never have recognized Isobel, Homer Crawford told himself.\nIsobel Cunningham, late of Columbia University where she'd taken her\nMaster's in anthropology. Isobel Cunningham, whom he had told on their\nfirst meeting that she looked like the former singing star, Lena\nHorne. Isobel Cunningham, slight of build, pixie of face, crisply\nmodern American with her tongue and wit. Was he in love with her? He\ndidn't know. El Hassan had no time, at present, for those things love\nimplied.\n\nShe said, \"Here,\" and led the way down a brick paved passage to a\nsmall house, almost a hut, that lay beyond.\n\nHomer Crawford looked about him critically before entering. He said,\n\"I suppose this has been scouted out adequately. Where's the back\nentrance?\" He scowled. \"Haven't the boys posted a sentry?\"\n\nA voice next to his ear said pleasantly, \"Stick 'em up, stranger.\nWhere'd you get that zoot suit?\"\n\nHe jerked his head about. There was a very small opening in the wooden\nwall next to him. It was Kenny Ballalou's voice.\n\n\"Zoot suit, yet!\" Homer snorted. \"I haven't heard that term since I\nwas in rompers.\"\n\n\"You in rompers I'd like to see,\" Kenny snorted in his turn. \"Come on\nin, everybody's here.\"\n\nThe aged, unpainted, warped, wooden house consisted of two rooms, the\none three times as large as the second. The furniture was minimal, but\nthere was sitting room on chair, stool and bed for the seven of them.\n\n\"Hail, O El Hassan!\" Elmer Allen called sourly, as Homer entered.\n\n\"And the hail with you,\" Homer called back, then, \"Oops, sorry,\nIsobel.\"\n\nIsobel put her hands on her hips, greatly widened by the stuffing\nshe'd placed beneath her skirts. \"Look,\" she said. \"Thus far, the El\nHassan organization, which claims rule of all North Africa, consists\nof six men and one dame ... ah, that is, one lady. Just so the lady\nwon't continually feel that she's being a drag on the conversation,\nyou are hereby allowed in moments of stress such shocking profanity as\nan occasional damn or hell. But only if said lady is also allowed such\nexpletives during periods of similar stress.\"\n\nEveryone laughed, and found chairs.\n\n\"I'm in love with Isobel Cunningham,\" Bey announced definitely.\n\n\"Second the motion,\" Elmer said.\n\nThe rest of them called, \"Aye.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" Homer Crawford said glumly, \"I can see that this is going to\nbe one tight knit organization. Six men in love with the one dame ...\nah, that is, lady. Kind of a reverse harem deal. Oh, this is going to\nlead to great co-operation.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey laughed again and then Jake said, \"Well, what's the story, Homer?\nHow does the El Hassan project sound to Zetterberg and the Reunited\nNations?\"\n\nCliff Jackson laughed bitterly. \"Why do you think we're in hiding?\"\nOnly he and Jake Armstrong wore western clothing. Kenny Ballalou,\nBey-ag-Akhamouk and Elmer Allen were in native dress, similar to that\nof Homer Crawford. Elmer Allen even bore a pilgrim's staff.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCrawford, glad that the edge of tenseness had been taken off the group\nby the banter with Isobel, turned serious now.\n\nHe said, \"This is where we each take our stand. You can turn back at\nthis point, any one of you, and things will undoubtedly go on as\nbefore. You'll keep your jobs, have no marks against you. Beyond this\npoint, and there's no turning back. I want you all to think it over,\nbefore coming to any snap decisions.\"\n\nElmer Allen said, his face wearing its usual all but sullen\nexpression. \"How about you?\"\n\nHomer said evenly, \"I've already taken my stand.\"\n\nKenny Ballalou yawned and said, \"I've been in this team for three or\nfour years, I'm too lazy to switch now Besides, I've always wanted to\nbe a corrupt politician. Can I be treasurer in this El Hassan regime?\"\n\n\"No,\" Homer said. \"Bey?\"\n\nBey-ag-Akhamouk said, \"I've always wanted to be a general. I'll come\nin under those circumstances.\"\n\nHomer said, his voice still even. \"That's out. From this point in,\nyou're a Field Marshal and Minister of Defense.\"\n\n\"Shucks,\" Bey said. \"I'd always wanted to be a general.\"\n\nHomer Crawford said dryly, \"Doesn't anybody take this seriously? It's\nprobably going to mean all your necks before it's through, you know.\"\n\nElmer Allen said dourly, \"I take it seriously. I spent the idealistic\nyears, the school years, working for peace, democracy, a better world.\nNow, here I am, helping to attempt to establish a tyranny over half\nthe continent of my racial background. But I'm in.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Homer said, the side of his mouth twitching. \"You can be our\nMinister of Propaganda.\"\n\n\"Minister of Propaganda!\" Elmer wailed. \"You mean like Goebbels? Me!\"\n\nHomer laughed. \"O.K., we'll call it Minister of Information, or Press\nSecretary to El Hassan. It all means the same thing.\" He looked at\nJacob Armstrong and said, \"How old are you, Jake?\"\n\n\"That's none of your business,\" the white-haired Jake said\naggressively. \"I'm in. El Hassan is the only answer. North Africa has\ngot to be united, both for internal and external purposes. If you ...\nif we ... don't do the job first, somebody else will, and off hand, I\ncan't think of anybody else I trust. I'm in.\"\n\nHomer Crawford looked at him for a long moment. \"Yes,\" he said\nfinally. \"Of course you are. Jake, you've just been made our combined\nForeign Minister and Plenipotentiary Extraordinary to the Reunited\nNations. You'll leave immediately, first for Geneva, to present our\ndemands to the Reunited Nations, then to New York.\"\n\n\"What do I do in New York?\" Jake Armstrong said blankly, trying to\nassimilate the curves that were being thrown to him.\n\n\"You raise money and support from starry eyed Negro groups and\nindividuals. You line up such organizations as the Africa for Africans\nAssociation behind El Hassan. You give speeches, and ruin your liver\neating at banquets every night in the week. You send out releases to\nthe press. You get all the publicity for the El Hassan movement you\ncan. You send official protests to the governments of every country in\nthe world, every time they do something that doesn't fit in with our\nneeds. You locate recruits and send them here to Africa to take over\nsome of the load. I don't have to tell you what to do. You can think\non your feet as well as I can. Do what is necessary. You're our\nForeign Minister. Don't let us see your face again until El Hassan is\nin control of North Africa.\"\n\nJake Armstrong blinked. \"How will I prove I'm your representative?\nI'll need more than just a note _To Whom It May Concern_.\"\n\nHomer Crawford thought about that.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBey said, \"One of our first jobs is going to have to be to capture a\ntown where they have a broadcast station, say Zinder or In Salah. When\nwe do, we'll announce that you're Foreign Minister.\"\n\nCrawford nodded. \"That's obviously the ticket. By that time you should\nbe in New York, with an office opened.\"\n\nJake rubbed a black hand over his cheek as though checking his morning\nshave. \"It's going to take some money to get started. Once started I\ncan depend on contributions, perhaps, but at first....\"\n\nHomer interrupted with, \"Cliff, you're Minister of the Treasury.\nRaise some money.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" Cliff Jackson said blankly. The king-size, easy-going\nCalifornian looked more like the early Joe Louis than ever.\n\nEverybody laughed. Elmer Allen came forth with his wallet and began\npulling out such notes as it contained. \"I don't know what we'd be\ndoing with this in the desert,\" he said.\n\nIsobel said, \"I have almost three thousand dollars in a checking\naccount in New York. Let's see if I have my checkbook here.\"\n\nThe others were going through their pockets. As bank notes in British\npounds, American dollars, French francs and Common Europe marks\nemerged they were tossed to the center of the small table which\nwobbled on three legs in the middle of the room.\n\nElmer Allen said, \"I have an account with the Bank of Jamaica in\nKingston. About four hundred pounds, I think. I'll have it\ntransferred.\"\n\nCliff took up the money and began counting it, making notations on a\nnotebook pad as he went.\n\nBey said, \"We're only going to be able to give Jake part of this.\"\n\n\"How's that?\" Elmer growled. \"What use have we for money in the\nSahara? Jake's got to put up a decent front in Geneva and New York.\"\n\nBey said doggedly, \"As Defense Minister, I'm opposed to El Hassan's\nfollowers _ever_ taking anything without generous payment. We'll need\nfood and various services. From the beginning, we're going to have to\npay our way. We can't afford to let rumors start going around that\nwe're nothing but a bunch of brigands.\"\n\n\"Bey's right,\" Homer nodded. \"The El Hassan movement is going to have\nto maintain itself on the highest ethical level. We're going to take\nover where the French Camel Corps left off and police North Africa.\nThere can't be a man from Somaliland to Mauretania who can say that\none of El Hassan's followers liberated him from as much as a date.\"\n\nKenny Ballalou said, \"You can always requisition whatever you need and\ngive them a receipt, and then we'll pay off when we come to power.\"\n\n\"That's out!\" Bey snapped. \"Most of these people can't read. And even\nthose that do don't trust what they read. A piece of paper, in their\neyes, is no return for some goats, or flour, camels, horses, or\nwhatever else it might be we need. No, we're going to have to pay our\nway.\"\n\nCrawford raked a hand back through his wiry hair. \"Bey's right, Kenny.\nIt's going to be a rough go, especially at first.\"\n\nKenny snorted. \"What do you mean, _at first?_ What's going to happen,\n_at second_ to make it any easier? Where're we going to get all this\nmoney we'll need to pay for even what we ourselves use, not to speak\nof the thousands of men we're going to have to have if El Hassan is\never to come to power?\"\n\nBey's eyebrows went up in shocked innocence. \"Kenny, dear boy, don't\nmisunderstand. We don't requisition anything from individuals, or\nclans, or small settlements. But if we take over a town such as Gao,\nor Niamey, or Colomb-B\u00c3\u00a9char, or wherever, there is nothing to say that\na legal government such as that of El Hassan, can't requisition the\ncontents of the local banks.\"\n\nHomer Crawford said with dignity, \"The term, my dear Minister of\nDefense, currently is to _nationalize_ the bank. Whether or not we\nwish to have the banks remain nationalized, after we take over, we can\nfigure out later. But in the early stages, I'm afraid we're going to\nhave to nationalize just about every bank we come in contact with.\"\n\nCliff Jackson said cautiously, \"I haven't said whether or not I'll\ncome in yet, but just as a point, I might mention issuing your own\nlegal tender. As soon as you liberate a printing press somewhere, of\ncourse.\"\n\nEveryone was charmed at the idea.\n\nIsobel said, \"You can see Cliff was _meant_ to be Minister of\nTreasury. He's got _wholesale_ larceny in his soul, none of this\npicayunish stuff such as robbing nomads of their sheep.\"\n\nElmer Allen was shaking his head sadly. \"This whole conversation\nstarted with Bey protesting that we couldn't allow ourselves to be\nthought of as brigands. Now listen to you all.\"\n\nKenny Ballalou said with considerable dignity, \"See here, friend.\nDon't you know the difference between brigandage and international\nfinance?\"\n\n\"No,\" Elmer said flatly.\n\n\"Hm-m-m,\" Kenny said.\n\n\"Let's get on with this,\" Homer said. \"The forming of El Hassan's\nbasic government is beginning to take on aspects of a minstrel show.\nThen we've all declared ourselves in ... except Cliff.\"\n\nAll eyes turned to the bulky Californian.\n\nHe sat scowling.\n\nHomer said, easily, \"You're not being urged, Cliff. You can turn back\nat this point.\"\n\nElmer Allen growled, \"You came to Africa to help your race develop its\ncontinent. To conquer such problems as sufficient food, clothing and\nshelter for all. To bring education and decent medical care to a\npeople who have had possibly the lowest living standards anywhere. Can\nyou see any way of achieving this beyond the El Hassan movement?\"\n\nCliff looked at him, still scowling stubbornly. \"That's not why I came\nto Africa.\"\n\nTheir eyes were all on him, but they remained silent.\n\nHe said, defensively, \"I'm no do-gooder. I took a job with the Africa\nfor Africans Association because it was the best job I could find.\"\n\nIsobel broke the silence by saying softly, \"I doubt it, Cliff.\"\n\nThe big man stood up from where he'd been seated on the bed. \"O.K.,\nO.K. Possibly there were other angles. I wanted to travel. Wanted to\nsee Africa. Besides, it was good background for some future job. I\nfigured it wouldn't hurt me any, in later years, applying for some\nfuture job. Maybe with some Negro concern in the States. I'd be able\nto say I'd put in a few years in Africa. Something like a Jew in New\nYork who was a veteran of the Israel-Arab wars, before the debacle.\"\n\nThey still looked at him, none of them accusingly.\n\nHe was irritated as he paced. \"Don't you see? Everybody doesn't have\nthis _dream_ that Homer's always talking about. That doesn't mean I'm\nabnormal. I just don't have the interest you do. All I want is a good\njob, some money in the bank, security back in the States. I'm not\ninterested in dashing all over the globe, getting shot at, dying for\nsome ideal.\"\n\nHomer said gently, \"It's up to you, Cliff. Nobody's twisting your\narm.\"\n\nThere was sweat on the big man's forehead. \"All I came to Africa for\nwas the job, the money I got out of it,\" he repeated, insisting.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo Homer Crawford suddenly came the realization that the other needed\nan out, an excuse. An explanation to himself for doing something he\nwanted to do but wouldn't admit because it went against the\nopportunistic code he told himself he followed.\n\nHomer said, \"All right. How much are you making as a field worker for\nthe Africa for Africans Association?\"\n\nCliff looked at him, uncomprehending. \"Eight thousand dollars, plus\nexpenses.\"\n\n\"O.K., we'll double that. Sixteen thousand to begin with, as El\nHassan's Minister of Treasury and whatever other duties we can think\nof to hang on you.\"\n\nThere was a long moment of silence, unbroken by any of the others.\nFinally in a gesture of desperation, Cliff Jackson waved at the money\nand checks sitting on the center table. \"Sixteen thousand a year! The\nwhole organization doesn't have enough to pay me six months' salary.\"\n\nHomer said mildly, \"That's why your pay was doubled. You have to take\nrisks to make money in this world, Cliff. If El Hassan does come to\npower, undoubtedly you'll get other raises--along with greater\nresponsibility.\"\n\nHe looked into Cliff Jackson's face, and although his words had dealt\nwith money, a man's dream looked out from his eyes. And the force of\npersonality that could emanate from Homer Crawford, possibly\nunbeknownst to himself, flooded over the huge Californian. The others\nin the room could feel it. Elmer Allen cleared his throat; Isobel held\nher elbows to her sides, in a feminine protest against naked male\npsychic strength.\n\nKenny Ballalou said without inflection, \"Put up or shut up, Cliff old\npal.\"\n\nCliff Jackson sank back onto the spot on the bed he'd occupied before.\n\"I'm in,\" he muttered, so softly as hardly to be heard.\n\n\"None of you are in,\" a voice from the doorway said.\n\nThe figure that stood there held a thin, but heavy calibered\nautomatic in his hand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was a dapper man, neat, trim, smart. His clothes were those of\nGreater Washington, rather than Dakar and West Africa. His facial\nexpression seemed overly alert, overly bright, and his features were\nmore Caucasian than Negroid.\n\nHe said, \"I believe you all know me. Fredric Ostrander.\"\n\n\"Of the Central Intelligence Agency,\" Homer Crawford said dryly. He as\nwell as Bey, Elmer and Kenny had risen to their feet when the newcomer\nentered from the smaller of the hut's two rooms. \"What's the gun for,\nOstrander?\"\n\n\"You're under arrest,\" the C.I.A. man said evenly.\n\nElmer Allen snorted. \"Under whose authority are you working? As a\nJamaican, I'm a citizen of the West Indies and a subject of Her\nMajesty.\"\n\n\"We'll figure that out later,\" Ostrander rapped. \"I'm sure the\nappropriate Commonwealth authorities will co-operate with the State\nDepartment and the Reunited Nations in this matter.\" The gun\nunwaveringly went from one of them to the other, retraced itself.\n\nBey looked at Homer Crawford.\n\nCrawford shook his head gently.\n\nHe said to the newcomer, \"The question still stands, Ostrander. Under\nwhose authority are you operating? I don't think you have jurisdiction\nover us. We're in Africa, not in the United States of the Americas.\"\n\nOstrander said tightly, \"Right now I'm operating under the authority\nof this weapon in my hand. Dr. Crawford. Do you realize that all of\nyou Americans here are risking your citizenship?\"\n\nKenny Ballalou said, \"Oh? Tell us more, Mr. State Department man.\"\n\n\"You're serving in the armed forces of a foreign power.\"\n\nEven the dour Elmer Allen laughed at that one.\n\nCrawford said, \"The fact of the matter is, we _are_ the foreign\npower.\"\n\n\"You're not amusing, Dr. Crawford,\" Ostrander said. \"I've kept up with\nthis situation since you had that conference in Timbuktu. The State\nDepartment has no intention of allowing some opportunist, backed by\nknown communists and fellow travelers, to seize power in this portion\nof the world. In a matter of months the Soviets would be in here.\"\n\nIsobel said evenly, \"I was formerly a member of the Party. I no longer\nam. I am an active opponent of the Soviet Complex at the moment,\nespecially in regard to its activity in Africa.\"\n\nOstrander snorted his disbelief.\n\nElmer Allen said, \"You chaps never forget, do you?\" He looked at the\nothers and explained. \"Back during college days, I signed a few peace\npetitions, that sort of thing. Ever since, every time I come in\ncontact with these people, you'd think I was Lenin or Trotsky.\"\n\nHomer Crawford said, \"My opinion is, Ostrander, that you've had to\nmove too quickly to check back with your superiors. Has the State\nDepartment actually instructed you to arrest me and my companions here\non foreign soil, without a warrant?\"\n\nOstrander clipped, \"That's my responsibility. I'm taking you all in.\nWe'll solve such problems as jurisdiction and warrants when I get you\nto the Reunited Nations headquarters.\"\n\n\"Ah?\" Homer Crawford said. \"And then what happens to us?\"\n\nOstrander jiggled the gun, impatiently. \"Sven Zetterberg is of the\nopinion that you should immediately be flown out of Africa and the\ncase brought before the High Council of the African Development\nProject. What measures will be taken beyond that point I have no way\nof knowing.\"\n\nBey took a step to the left, Kenny Ballalou one to the right. Homer\nCrawford remained immediately before the C.I.A. operative, his hands\nslightly out from his sides, palms slightly forward.\n\nOstrander snapped, \"I'm prepared to fire, you men. I don't\nunderestimate the importance of this situation. If your crazy scheme\nmakes any progress at all, it might well result in the death of\nthousands. I know your background, Crawford. You once taught judo in\nthe Marines. I'm not unfamiliar with the art myself.\"\n\nIsobel had a hand to her mouth, her eyes were wide. \"Boys, don't ...\"\nshe began.\n\nElmer Allen had been leaning on his pilgrim's staff, as though weary\nwith this whole matter. He said to Ostrander, interestedly, \"So you've\nbeen checked out on judo? Know anything about the use of the\nquarterstaff?\"\n\nOstrander kept his gun traversing between the four of them. \"Eh?\" he\nsaid.\n\nElmer Allen shifted his grip on his staff infinitesimally. Of a\nsudden, the end of the staff, now gripped with both hands near the\ncenter, moved at invisibly high speed. There was a crack of the wrist\nbone, and the gun went flying. The other end of the staff flicked out\nand rapped the C.I.A. operative smartly on the head.\n\nFredric Ostrander crumbled to the floor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Confound it, Elmer,\" Crawford said. \"What'd you have to go and do\nthat for? I wanted to talk to him some more and send a message back to\nZetterberg. Sooner or later we've got to make our peace with the\nReunited Nations.\"\n\nElmer said embarrassedly, \"Sorry, it just happened. I was merely going\nto knock the gun out of his hand, but then I couldn't help myself. I\nwas tired of hearing that holier-than-thou voice of his.\"\n\nKenny Ballalou looked down at the fallen man gloomily. \"He'll be out\nfor an hour. You're lucky you didn't crack his skull.\"\n\n\"Holy Mackerel,\" Cliff Jackson said. \"I'm going to have to learn to\noperate one of those things.\"\n\nElmer Allen handed him the supposed pilgrim's staff. \"Best\nhand-to-hand combat weapon ever invented,\" he said. \"The British\nyeoman's quarterstaff. Of course, this is a modernized version. Made\nof epoxy resin glass-fiber material, treated to look like wood. That\nstuff can turn a high-velocity bullet, let alone a sword, and it can\nbe bent in a ninety degree arc without the slightest effect, although\nit'd take a power-driven testing machine to do it.\"\n\n\"All right, all right,\" Homer said. \"We haven't got time for lessons\nin the use of the quarterstaff. Let's put some thought to this\nsituation. If Ostrander here was able to find us, somebody else would,\ntoo.\"\n\nIsobel licked the side of her mouth. \"He was probably following me.\nRemember, I told you Homer?\"\n\nKenny said, \"If he had anyone with him, he'd have brought them along\nto cover him. You've got to give him credit for bravery, taking on the\nwhole bunch of us by himself.\"\n\n\"Um-m-m,\" Homer said. \"I wish he was with us instead of against us.\"\n\nJake Armstrong said, \"Well, this solves one problem.\"\n\nThey looked at him.\n\nHe said, \"Just as sure as sure, he's got a car parked somewhere. A car\nwith some sort of United States or Reunited Nations emblem on it.\"\n\n\"So what?\" Kenny said.\n\n\"So you've got to get out of town before the search for you _really_\ngets under way. With such a car, you can get past any roadblock that\nmight already be up between here and the Yoff airport.\"\n\nElmer Allen had sunk to his knees and was searching the fallen C.I.A.\nman. He came up with car keys and a wallet.\n\nHomer said to Jake Armstrong, \"Why the Yoff airport?\"\n\n\"Our plane is there,\" Jake told him. \"The one assigned Isobel, Cliff\nand me by the AFAA. You're going to have to make time. Get somewhere\nout in the ah, boondocks, where you can begin operations.\"\n\nBey said thoughtfully, \"He's right, Homer. Anybody against us, like\nour friend here\"--he nodded at Ostrander--\"is going to try to get us\nquick, before we can get the El Hassan movement under way. We've got\nto get out of Dakar and into some area where they'll have their work\ncut out trying to locate us.\"\n\nHomer Crawford accepted their council. \"O.K., let's get going. Jake,\nyou'll stay in Dakar, and at first play innocent. As soon as possible,\ntake plane for Geneva. As soon as you're there, send out press\nreleases to all the news associations and the larger papers. Announce\nyourself as Foreign Minister of El Hassan and demand that he be\nrecognized as the legal head of state of all North Africa.\"\n\n\"Wow,\" Cliff Jackson said.\n\n\"Then play it by ear,\" Homer finished.\n\nHe turned to the others. \"Bey, where'd you leave our two hover-lorries\nwhen you came here to Dakar?\"\n\n\"Stashed away in the ruins of a former mansion in Timbuktu. Hired two\nSonghai to watch them.\"\n\n\"O.K. Cliff, you're the only one in European dress. Take this wallet\nof Ostrander's. You'll drive the car. If we run into any roadblocks\nbetween here and the Yoff airport, slow down a little and hold the\nwallet out to show your supposed identification. They won't take the\ntime to check the photo. Bluff your way past, don't completely stop\nthe car.\"\n\n\"What happens if they do stop us?\" Cliff said worriedly.\n\nKenny Ballalou said, \"That'll be just too bad for them.\"\n\nBey stooped and scooped up the fallen automatic of Fredric Ostrander\nand tucked it into the voluminous folds of his native robe. \"Here we\ngo again,\" he said.\n\n\nIII\n\nThe man whose undercover name was Anton, landed at Gibraltar in a BEA\nroco-jet, passed quickly through customs and immigration with his\nCommonwealth passport and made his way into town. He checked with a\nBobby and found that he had a two-hour wait until the Mons Capa ferry\nleft for Tangier, and spent the time wandering up and down Main\nStreet, staring into the Indian shops with their tax-free cameras from\nCommon Europe, textiles from England, optical equipment from Japan,\nand cheap souvenirs from everywhere. Gibraltar, the tourist's shopping\nparadise.\n\nThe trip between Gibraltar and Tangier takes approximately two hours.\nIf you've never made it before, you stand on deck and watch Spain\nrecede behind you, and Africa loom closer. This was where Hercules\nsupposedly threw up his Pillars, Gibraltar being the one on the\nEuropean shore. Those who have made the trip again and again, sit down\nin the bar and enjoy the tax-free prices. The man named Anton stood on\nthe deck. He was African by birth, but he'd never been to Morocco\nbefore.\n\nWhen he landed, he made the initial error of expecting the local\ncitizenry to speak Arabic. They didn't. Rif, a Berber tongue, was the\nfirst language. The man called Anton had to speak French to make known\nhis needs. He took a Chico cab up from the port to the El Minza hotel,\nimmediately off the Plaza de France, the main square of the European\nsection.\n\nAt the hotel entrance were two jet-black doormen attired in a\npseudo-Moroccan costume of red fez, voluminous pants and yellow\nbarusha slippers. They made no note of his complexion, there is no\ncolor bar in the Islamic world.\n\nHe had reservations at the desk. He left his passport there to go\nthrough the standard routine, including being checked by the police,\nhad his bag sent up to his room and, a few minutes later, hands\nnonchalantly in pockets, strolled along the Rue de Libert\u00c3\u00a9 toward the\ncasbah area of the medina. Up from the native section of town streamed\nhordes of costumed Rifs, Arabs, Berbers of a dozen tribes, even an\noccasional Blue Man. At least half the women still wore the haik and\nveil, half the men the burnoose. Africa changes slowly, the man\ncalled Anton admitted to himself all over again--so slowly.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nDown from the European section, which could have been a Californian\ncity, filtered every nation of the West, from every section of Common\nEurope, the Americas, the Soviet Complex. If any city in the world is\na melting pot, it is Tangier, where Africa meets Europe and where East\nmeets West.\n\nHe passed through the teaming Grand Zocco market, and through the\ngates of the old city. He took Rue Singhalese, the only street in the\nmedina wide enough to accommodate a vehicle and went almost as far as\nthe Zocco Chico, once considered the most notorious square in the\nworld.\n\nFor a moment the man called Anton stood before one of the Indian shops\nand stared at the window's contents. Carved ivory statuettes from the\nFar East, cameras from Japan, ebony figurines, chess sets of water\njade, gimcracks from everywhere.\n\nA Hindu stood in the doorway and rubbed his hands in a gesture so\nstereotyped as to be ludicrous. \"Sir, would you like to enter my shop?\nI have amazing bargains.\"\n\nThe man they called Anton entered.\n\nHe looked about the shop, otherwise empty of customers. Vaguely, he\nwondered if the other ever sold anything, and, if so, to whom.\n\nHe said, \"I was looking for an ivory elephant, from the East.\"\n\nThe Indian's eyebrows rose. \"A white elephant?\"\n\n\"A red elephant,\" the man called Anton said.\n\n\"In here,\" the Hindu said evenly, and led the way to the rear.\n\nThe rooms beyond were comfortable but not ostentatious. They passed\nthrough a livingroom-study to an office beyond. The door was open and\nthe Indian merely gestured in the way of introduction, and then left.\n\nKirill Menzhinsky, agent superior of the _Chrezvychainaya Komissiya_\nfor North Africa, looked up from his desk, smiled his pleasure, came\nto his feet and held out his hand.\n\n\"Anton!\" he said. \"I've been expecting you.\"\n\nThe man they called Anton smiled honestly and shook. \"Kirill,\" he\nsaid. \"It's been a long time.\"\n\nThe other motioned to a comfortable armchair, resumed his own seat.\n\"It's been a long time all right--almost five years. As I recall, I\nwas slung over your shoulder, and you were wading through those\nconfounded swamps. The ...\"\n\n\"The Everglades.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" The heavy-set Russian espionage chief chuckled. \"You are much\nstronger than you look, Anton. As I recall, I ordered you to abandon\nme.\"\n\nThe wiry Negro grunted deprecation. \"You were delirious from your\nwound.\"\n\nThe Russian came to his feet, turned his back and went to a small\nimprovised bar. He said, his voice low, \"No, Anton, I wasn't\ndelirious. Perhaps a bit afraid, but then the baying of dogs is\ndisconcerting.\"\n\nThe man they called Anton said, \"It is all over now.\"\n\nThe Russian returned and said, \"A drink, Anton? As I recall you were\nnever the man to refuse a drink. Scotch, bourbon, vodka?\"\n\nThe other shrugged. \"I believe in drinking the local product. What is\nthe beverage of Tangier?\"\n\nKirill Menzhinsky took up a full bottle the contents of which had a\ngreenish, somewhat _oily_ tinge. \"Absinthe,\" he said. \"Guaranteed to\nturn your brains to mush if you take it long enough. What was the name\nof that French painter...?\"\n\n\"Toulouse Lautrec,\" Anton supplied. \"I thought the stuff was illegal\nthese days.\" He watched the other add water to the potent liqueur.\n\nThe Russian chuckled. \"Nothing is illegal in Tangier, my dear Anton,\nexcept the Party.\" He laughed at his own joke and handed the other his\nglass. He poured himself a jolt of vodka and returned to his chair.\n\"To the world revolution, Anton.\"\n\nThe Negro saluted with his drink. \"The revolution!\"\n\nThey drank.\n\nThe Russian put down his glass and sighed. \"I wish we were some place\nin our own lands, Anton. Dinner, many drinks, perhaps some girls, eh?\"\n\nAnton shrugged. \"Another time, Kirill.\"\n\n\"Yes. As it is, we should not be seen together. Nor, for that matter\nshould you even return here. The imperialists are not stupid. Very\npossibly, American and Common Europe espionage agents know of this\nheadquarters. Not to speak of the Arab Union. I shall try to give you\nthe whole story and your assignment in this next half hour. Then you\nshould depart immediately.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe man they called Anton sipped his drink and relaxed in his chair.\nHe looked at his superior without comment.\n\nThe Russian took another jolt of his water-clear drink. \"Have you ever\nheard of El Hassan?\"\n\nThe Negro thought a moment before saying, \"Vaguely. Evidently an Arab,\nor possibly a Tuareg. North African nationalist. No, that wouldn't be\nthe word, since he is international. At any rate, he seems to be\ndrawing a following in the Sahara and as far south as the Sudan. Backs\nmodernization and wants unity of all North Africa. Is he connected\nwith the Party?\"\n\nThe espionage chief was shaking his head. \"That is the answer I\nexpected you to give, and is approximately what anyone else would have\nsaid. Actually, there is no such person as El Hassan.\"\n\nAnton frowned. \"I'm afraid you're wrong there, Kirill. I've heard\nabout him in half a dozen places. Very mysterious figure. Nobody seems\nto have seen him, but word of his program is passed around from\nEthiopia to Mauretania.\"\n\nThe Russian was shaking his head negatively. \"That I know. It's a\nrather strange story and one rather hard to believe if it wasn't for\nthe fact that one of my operatives was in on the, ah, _manufacturing_\nof this Saharan leader.\"\n\n\"Manufacturing?\"\n\n\"I'll give you the details later. Were you acquainted with Abraham\nBaker, the American comrade?\"\n\n\"Were? I _am_ acquainted with him. Abe is a friend as well as a\ncomrade.\"\n\nThe Russian shook his head again. \"Baker is dead, Anton. As you\npossibly know, his assignment for the past few years has been with a\nReunited Nations African Development Project team, working in the\nSahara region. We planted him there expecting the time to arrive when\nhis services would be of considerable value. He worked with a five-man\nteam headed by a Dr. Homer Crawford and largely the team's task was to\neliminate bottlenecks that developed as the various modernization\nprojects spread over the desert.\"\n\n\"But what's this got to do with _manufacturing_ El Hassan?\"\n\n\"I'm coming to that. Crawford's team, including Comrade Baker, usually\ndisguised themselves as Enaden smiths. As such, their opinions carried\nlittle weight so in order to spread Reunited Nations propaganda, they\nhit upon the idea of imputing everything they said to this great hero\nof the desert, El Hassan.\"\n\n\"I see,\" the man called Anton said.\n\n\"Others, without knowing the origin of our El Hassan, took up the idea\nand spread it. These nomads are at an ethnic level where they want a\nhero to follow, a leader. So in order to give prestige to their\nteachings the various organizations trying to advance North Africa\nfollowed in Crawford's footsteps and attributed their teachings to\nthis mysterious El Hassan.\"\n\n\"And it snowballed.\"\n\n\"Correct! But the point is that after a time Crawford came around to\nthe belief that there should be a real El Hassan. That the primary\ntask at this point is to unite the area, to break down the old tribal\nsociety and introduce the populace to the new world.\"\n\n\"He's probably right,\" the man called Anton growled. He finished his\ndrink, got up from his chair and on his own went over and mixed\nanother. \"More vodka?\" he asked.\n\n\"Please.\" The Russian held up his glass and went on talking. \"Yes,\nundoubtedly that is what is needed at this point. As it is, things are\ntrending toward a collapse. The imperialists, especially the\nAmericans, of course, wish to dominate the area for their capitalistic\npurposes. The Arab Union wishes to take over _in toto_ and make it\npart of their Islamic world. We, of course, cannot afford to let\neither succeed.\"\n\nThe Negro resumed his chair, sipped at his drink and listened, nodding\nfrom time to time.\n\nKirill Menzhinsky said, \"As you know, Marx and Engels when founding\nscientific socialism had no expectation that their followers would\nfirst come to power in such backward countries as the Russia of 1917\nor the China of 1949. In fact, the establishment of true socialism\npresupposes a highly developed industrial economy. It is simply\nimpossible without such an economy. When Lenin came to power in 1917,\nas a result of the chaotic conditions that prevailed upon the military\ncollapse of Imperial Russia, he had no expectation of going it alone,\nas the British would say. He expected immediate revolutions in such\ncountries as Germany and France and supposed that these more advanced\ncountries would then come to the assistance of the Soviet Union and\nall would advance together to true socialism.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It didn't work out that way,\" the man called Anton said dryly.\n\n\"No, it didn't. And Lenin didn't live to see the steps that Stalin\nwould take in order to build the necessary industrial base in Russia.\"\nKirill Menzhinsky looked about the room, almost as though checking to\nsee if anyone else was listening. \"Some of our more unorthodox\ntheoreticians are inclined to think that had Lenin survived the\nassassin's bullet, that Comrade Stalin would have found it necessary\nto, ah, liquidate him.\"\n\nThe Russian cleared his throat. \"Be that as it may, basic changes were\nmade in Marxist teachings to fit into Stalin's and later Khrushchev's\nnew concepts of the worker's State. And the Soviet Union muddled\nthrough, as the British have it. Today, the Soviet Complex is as\npowerful as the imperialist powers.\"\n\nThe espionage leader knocked back his vodka with a practiced stiff\nwristed motion. \"Which brings us to the present and to North Africa.\"\nHe leaned forward in emphasis. \"Comrade, if the past half century and\nmore has taught us anything, it is that you cannot establish socialism\nin a really backward country. In short, communism is impossible in\nNorth Africa at this point in her social evolution. Impossible. You\ncannot go directly from tribal society to communism. At this historic\npoint, there is no place for the party's program in North Africa.\"\n\nThe man called Anton scowled.\n\nThe Russian waggled his hand negatively. \"Yes, yes. I know.\nUltimately, the whole world must become Soviet. Only that way will we\nachieve our eventual goal. But that is the long view. Realistically,\nwe must face it, as the Yankees say. This area is not at present soil\nfor our seed.\"\n\n\"Things move fast these days,\" the Negro growled. \"Industrialization,\neducation, can be a geometric progression.\"\n\nHis superior nodded emphatically. \"Of course, and as little as ten or\nfifteen years from now, given progress at the present rate, perhaps\nthere will be opportunity for our movement. But now? No.\"\n\nThe other said, \"What has all this to do with El Hassan, or Crawford,\nor whatever the man's name is?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the Russian said. \"Homer Crawford has evidently decided to\nbecome El Hassan.\"\n\n\"Ahhh.\"\n\n\"Yes. At this point, in short, he is traveling in our direction. He is\ndoing what we realize must be done.\"\n\n\"Then we will support him?\"\n\n\"Now we come to the point, Anton. Homer Crawford is not sympathetic to\nthe Party. To the contrary. Our suspicion, although we have no proof,\nis that he killed Comrade Abe Baker, when Baker approached him on his\nstand in regard to the Party's long view.\"\n\n\"I see,\" the man called Anton said.\n\nThe Russian nodded. \"We must keep in some sort of touch with him--some\nsort of control. If this El Hassan realizes his scheme and unites all\nNorth Africa, sooner or later we will have to deal with him. If he is\nantagonistic, we will have to find means to liquidate him.\"\n\n\"And my assignment...?\"\n\n\"He will be gathering followers at this point. Many followers, most of\nwhom will be unknown to him. You will become one of them. Raise\nyourself to as high a rank as you find possible in his group. Become a\nclose friend, if that can be done....\"\n\n\"He killed Abe Baker, eh?\"\n\nThe Russian frowned. \"This is an assignment, Comrade Anton. There is\nno room for personal feelings. You are a good field man. Among the\nbest. You are being given this task because the Party feels you are\nthe man for it. Possibly it is an assignment that will take years in\nthe fulfilling.\"\n\nThe Negro said nothing.\n\n\"Are there any questions?\"\n\n\"Do we have any other operatives working on this?\"\n\nThe frown became a scowl. \"An Isobel Cunningham worked with Comrade\nBaker, but it has been suspected that she has been drifting away from\nthe party these past few years. Her present status is unknown, but she\nis believed to be with Homer Crawford and his followers. Possibly she\nhas defected. If so, you will take whatever measures seem necessary.\nYou will be working almost completely on your own, Comrade. You must\nthink on your feet, as the Yankees say.\"\n\nThe man called Anton thought a moment. He said, \"You'd better give me\nas thorough a run down as possible on this Homer Crawford and his\nimmediate followers.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMenzhinsky settled back in his chair and took up a sheaf of papers\nfrom the desk. \"We have fairly complete dossiers. I'll give you the\nhighlights, then you can take these with you to your hotel to study at\nleisure.\"\n\nHe took up the first sheet. \"Homer Crawford. Born in Detroit of\nworking-class parents. In his late teens interrupted his education to\ncome to Africa where he joined elements of the F.L.N. in Morocco and\ntook part in several forays into Algeria. Evidently was wounded and\ninvalided back to the States where he resumed his education. When he\ncame of military age, he joined the Marine Corps and spent the usual,\nah, hitch I believe they call it. Following that, he resumed his\neducation, finally taking a doctor's degree in sociology. He then\ntaught for a time until the Reunited Nations began its African\nprogram. He accepted a position, and soon distinguished himself.\"\n\nThe Russian took up another paper. \"According to Comrade Baker's\nreports, Crawford is an outstanding personality, dominating others,\neven in spite of himself. He would make a top party man. Idealistic,\nstrong, clever, ruthless when ruthlessness is called for.\"\n\nMenzhinsky paused for a moment, finding words hard to come by from an\nultra-materialist. His tone went wry. \"Comrade Baker also reported a\nsomewhat mystical quality in our friend Crawford. An ability in times\nof emotional crisis to break down men's mental barriers against him. A\n_force_ that ...\"\n\nThe other raised his eyebrows.\n\nHis superior chuckled, ruefully. \"Comrade Baker was evidently much\nswayed by the man's personality. However, Anton, I might point out\nthat similar reports have come down to us of such a dominating\npersonality in Lenin, and, to a lesser degree, in Stalin.\" He twisted\nhis mouth. \"History leads us to believe that such personalities as\nJesus and Mohammed seemed to have some power beyond that of we more\nmundane types.\"\n\n\"And the others?\" Anton said.\n\nThe Russian took up still another paper. \"Elmer Allen. Born of small\nfarmer background on the outskirts of Kingston, on the island of\nJamaica. Managed to work his way through the University of Kingston\nwhere he took a master's degree in sociology. At one time he was\nthought to be Party material and was active in several organizations\nthat held social connotations, pacifist groups and so forth. However,\nhe was never induced to join the Party. Upon graduation, he\nimmediately took employment with the Reunited Nations and was assigned\nto Homer Crawford's team. He is evidently in accord with Crawford's\naims as El Hassan.\"\n\nThe espionage chief took up another sheet. \"Bey-ag-Akhamouk ...\"\n\nThe other scowled. \"That can't be an American name.\"\n\n\"No. He is the only real African associated with Crawford at this\npoint. He was evidently born a Taureg and taken to the States at an\nearly age, three or four, by a missionary. At any rate, he was\neducated at the University of Minnesota where he studied political\nscience. We have no record of where he stands politically, but Comrade\nBaker rated him as an outstanding intuitive soldier. A veritable\ngenius in combat. He would seem to have had military experience\nsomewhere, but we have no record of it. Our Bey-ag-Akhamouk seems\nsomewhat of a mystery man.\"\n\nThe Russian sorted out another sheet. \"Kenneth Ballalou, born in\nLouisiana, educated in Chicago. Another young man but evidently as\ncapable as the others. He seems to be quite a linguist. So far as we\nknow, he holds no political stand whatsoever.\"\n\nMenzhinsky pursed his lips before saying, \"The Isobel Cunningham I\nmentioned worked with the Africa for Africans Association with two\ncolleagues, a Jacob Armstrong and Clifford Jackson. It is possible\nthat these two, as well as Isobel Cunningham, have joined El Hassan.\nIf so, we will have to check further upon them, although I understand\nArmstrong is rather elderly and hardly effective under the\ncircumstances.\"\n\nThe man called Anton said evenly, \"And this former comrade, Isobel\nCunningham, has evidently joined with Crawford even though he ... was\nthe cause of Abe Baker's death?\"\n\n\"Evidently.\"\n\nThe Negro's eyes narrowed.\n\nThe other said, \"And evidently she is a most intelligent and\nattractive young lady. We had rather high hopes for her formerly.\"\n\nThe Negro party member came to his feet and gathered up the sheaf of\npapers from the desk. \"All right,\" he said. \"Is there anything else?\"\n\nThe espionage chief shook his head. \"You do not need a step by step\nblueprint, Anton, that is why you have been chosen for this\nassignment. You are strongly based in Party doctrine. You know what is\nneeded, we can trust you to carry on the Party's aims.\" After a pause,\nthe Russian added, \"Without being diverted by personal feelings.\"\n\nAnton looked him in the face. \"Of course,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFredric Ostrander was on the carpet.\n\nHis chief said, \"You seem to have conducted yourself rather\nprecipitately, Fred.\"\n\nOstrander shrugged in irritation. \"I didn't have time to consult\nanyone. By pure luck, I spotted the Cunningham girl and since I knew\nshe had affiliated herself with Crawford, I followed her.\"\n\nThe chief said dryly, \"And tried to arrest the seven of them, all by\nyourself.\"\n\n\"I couldn't see anything else to do.\"\n\nThe C.I.A. official said, \"In the first place, we have no legal\njurisdiction here and you could have caused an international stink.\nThe Russkies would just love to bring something like this onto the\nReunited Nations floor. In the second place, you failed. How in the\nworld did you expect to take on that number of men, especially\nCrawford and his team?\"\n\nOstrander flushed his irritation. \"Next time ...\" he began.\n\nHis chief waved a hand negatively. \"Let's hope there isn't going to be\nnext time, of this type.\" He took up a paper from his desk. \"Here's\nyour new job, Fred. You're to locate this El Hassan and keep in\ncontinual contact with him. If he meets with any sort of success at\nall, and frankly our agency doubts that he will, you will attempt to\nbring home to Crawford and his followers the fact that they are\nAmericans, and orientate them in the direction of the West. Above all,\nyou are to keep in touch with us and keep us informed on all\ndevelopments. Especially notify us if there is any sign that our El\nHassan is in communication with the Russkies or any other foreign\nelement.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Ostrander said.\n\nHis chief looked at him. \"We're giving you this job, Fred, because\nyou're more up on it than anyone else. You're in at the beginning, so\nto speak. Now, do you want me to assign you a couple of assistants?\"\n\n\"White men?\" Ostrander said.\n\nHis higher-up scowled. \"You know you're the only Negro in our agency,\nFred.\"\n\nFredric Ostrander, his voice still even, said, \"That's too bad,\nbecause anyone you assigned me who wasn't a Negro would be a hindrance\nrather than an assistant.\"\n\nThe other drummed his fingers on the table in irritation. He said\nsuddenly, \"Fred, do you think I ought to do a report to Greater\nWashington suggesting they take more Negro operatives into the\nagency?\"\n\nOstrander said dryly, \"You'd better if this department is going to get\nmuch work done in Africa.\" He stood up. \"I suppose that the sooner I\nget onto the job, the better. Do you have any idea at all where\nCrawford and his gang headed after they left me unconscious in that\nfilthy hut?\"\n\n\"No, we haven't the slightest idea of where they might be, other than\nthat they left your car abandoned at the Yoff airport.\"\n\n\"Oh, great,\" Fredric Ostrander complained. \"They've gone into hiding\nin an area somewhat twice the size of the original fifty United\nStates.\"\n\n\"Good luck,\" his chief said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRex Donaldson, formerly of Nassau in the British Bahamas, formerly of\nthe College of Anthropology, Oxford, now field man for the African\nDepartment of the British Commonwealth working at expediting native\ndevelopment, was taking time out for needed and unwonted relaxation.\nIn fact, he stretched out on his back in the most comfortable bed, in\nthe most comfortable hotel, in the Niger town of Mopti. His hands\nwere behind his head, and his scowling eyes were on the ceiling.\n\nHe was a small, bent man, inordinately black even for the Sudan and\nthe loincloth costume he wore was ludicrous in the Westernized comfort\nof the hotel room. He was attired for the bush and knew that it was\nsheer laziness now that kept him from taking off for the Dogon country\nof the Canton de Sangha where he was currently working to bring down\ntribal prejudices against the coming of the schools. He had his work\ncut out for him in the Dogon, the old men, the tribal elders they\ncalled Hogons, instinctively knew that the coming of education meant\nsubversion of their institutions and the eventual loss of Hogon power.\n\nHis portable communicator, sitting on the bedside table, buzzed and\nthe little man grumbled a profanity and swung his crooked legs around\nto the floor. His eyebrows went up when he realized it was a priority\ncall which probably meant from London.\n\nHe flicked the reception switch and a girl's face faded onto the\nscreen. She said, \"A moment, Mr. Donaldson, Sir Winton wants you.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Rex Donaldson said. Sir Winton, yet. Head of the African\nDepartment. Other than photographs, Donaldson had never seen his\nultimate superior, not to mention speaking to him personally.\n\nThe girl's face faded out and that of Sir Winton Brett-Homes faded in.\nThe heavy-set, heavy-faced Englishman looked down, obviously checking\nsomething on his desk. He looked up again, said, \"Rex Donaldson?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I won't waste time on preliminaries, Donaldson. We've been\ndiscussing, here, some of the disconcerting rumors coming out of your\nsection. Are you acquainted with this figure, El Hassan?\"\n\nThe black man's eyes widened. He said, cautiously, \"I have heard a\ngood many stories and rumors.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course. They have been filtering into this office for more\nthan a year. But thus far little that could be considered concrete has\ndeveloped.\"\n\nRex Donaldson held his peace, waited for the other to go on.\n\nSir Winton said impatiently, \"Actually, we are still dealing with\nrumors, but they are beginning to shape up. Evidently, this El Hassan\nhas finally begun to move.\"\n\n\"Ahhh,\" the wiry little field man breathed.\n\nThe florid faced Englishman said, \"As we understand it, he wishes to\ncut across tribal, national and geographic divisions in all North\nAfrica, wishes to unite the whole area from Sudan to the\nMediterranean.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Donaldson nodded. \"That seems to be his program.\"\n\nSir Winton said, \"It has been decided that the interests of Her\nMajesty's government and that of the Commonwealth hardly coincide with\nsuch an attempt at this time. It would lead to chaos.\"\n\n\"Ahhh,\" Donaldson said.\n\nSir Winton wound it up, all but beaming. \"Your instructions, then,\nare to seek out this El Hassan and combat his efforts with whatever\nmeans you find necessary. We consider you one of our most competent\noperatives, Donaldson.\"\n\nRex Donaldson said slowly, \"You mean that he is to be stopped at all\ncost?\"\n\nThe other cleared his throat. \"You are given carte blanche, Donaldson.\nYou and our other operatives in the Sahara and Sudan. Stop El Hassan.\"\n\nRex Donaldson said flatly, \"You have just received my resignation, Sir\nWinton.\"\n\n\"What ... what!\"\n\n\"You heard me,\" Donaldson said.\n\n\"But ... but what are you going to do?\" The heavy face of the African\nDepartment head was going a reddish-purple, which rather fascinated\nDonaldson but he had no time to further contemplate the phenomenon.\n\n\"I'm going to round up a few of my colleagues, of similar mind to my\nown, and then I'm going to join El Hassan,\" the little man snapped.\n\"Good-bye, Sir Winton.\"\n\nHe clicked the set off and then looked down at it. His dour face broke\ninto a rare grin. \"Now there's an ambition I've had for donkey's\nyears,\" he said aloud. \"To hang up on a really big mucky-muck.\"\n\n\nIV\n\nFollowing the attack of the unidentified rocketcraft, El Hassan's\nparty was twice again nearly flushed by reconnoitering planes of\nunknown origin. They weren't making the time they wanted.\n\nBeneath a projecting rock face over a gravel bottomed wadi, the two\nhover-lorries were hidden, whilst a slow-moving helio-jet made\nsweeping, high-altitude circlings above them.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe six stared glumly upward.\n\nCliff Jackson who was on the radio called out, \"I just picked him up.\nHe's called in to Fort Lamy reporting no luck. His fuel's running\nshort and he'll be knocking off soon.\"\n\nHomer Crawford rapped, \"What language?\"\n\n\"French,\" Cliff said, \"but it's not his. I mean he's not French, just\nusing the language.\"\n\nBey's face was as glum as any and there was a tic at the side of his\nmouth. He said now, \"We've got to come up with something. Sooner or\nlater one of them will spot us and this next time we won't have any\nfantastic breaks like Homer being able to knock him off with a\nTommy-Noiseless. He'll drop a couple of neopalms and burn up a square\nmile of desert including El Hassan and his whole crew.\"\n\nHomer looked at him. \"Any ideas, Bey?\"\n\n\"No,\" the other growled.\n\nHomer Crawford said, \"Any of the rest of you?\"\n\nIsobel was frowning, bringing something back. \"Why don't we travel at\nnight?\"\n\n\"And rest during the day?\" Homer said.\n\nKenny said, \"Parking where? We just made it to this wadi. If we're\ncaught out in the dunes somewhere when one of those planes shows up,\nwe've had it. You couldn't hide a jackrabbit out there.\"\n\nBut Bey and Homer Crawford were still looking at Isobel.\n\nShe said, \"I remember a story the Tuaregs used to tell about a raid\nsome of them made back during the French occupation. They stole four\nhundred camels near Timbuktu one night and headed north. The French\nweren't worried. The next morning, they simply sent out a couple of\naircraft to spot the Tuareg raiders and the camels. Like Kenny said,\nyou couldn't hide a jackrabbit in dune country. But there was nothing\nto be seen. The French couldn't believe it, but they still weren't\nreally worried. After all a camel herd can travel only thirty or so\nmiles a day. So the next day the planes went out again, circling,\ncircling, but they still didn't spot the thieves and their loot, nor\nthe next day. Well, to shorten it, the Tuareg got their four hundred\ncamels all the way up to Spanish Rio de Oro where they sold them.\"\n\nShe had their staring attention. \"How?\" Elmer blurted.\n\n\"It was simple. They traveled all night and then, at dawn, buried the\ncamels and themselves in the sand and stayed there all day.\"\n\nHomer said, \"I'm sold. Boys, I hope you're in physical trim because\nthere's going to be quite a bit of digging for the next few days.\"\n\nCliff groaned. \"Some Minister of the Treasury,\" he complained. \"They\ngive him a shovel instead of a bankbook.\"\n\nEveryone laughed.\n\nBey said, \"Well, I suppose we stay here until nightfall.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Homer said. \"Whose turn is it to pull cook duty?\"\n\nIsobel said menacingly, \"I don't know whose turn it is, but I know I'm\ngoing to do the cooking. After that slumgullion Kenny whipped up\nyesterday, I'm a perpetual volunteer for the job of chef--strictly in\nself-defense.\"\n\n\"That was a cruel cut,\" Kenny protested, \"however, I hereby relinquish\nall my rights to cooking for this expedition.\"\n\n\"And me!\"\n\n\"And me!\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" Homer said, \"so Isobel is Minister of the Royal Kitchen.\" He\nlooked at Elmer Allen. \"Which reminds me. You're our junior\ntheoretician. Are we a monarchy?\"\n\nElmer Allen scowled sourly and sat down, his back to the wadi wall. \"I\nwouldn't think so.\"\n\nIsobel went off to make coffee in the portable galley in the rear of\nthe second hovercraft. The others brought forth tobacco and squatted\nor sat near the dour Jamaican. Years in the desert had taught them the\nnomad's ability to relax completely given opportunity.\n\n\"So if it's not a monarchy, what'll we call El Hassan?\" Kenny\ndemanded.\n\nElmer said slowly, thoughtfully, \"We'll call him simply _El Hassan_.\nMonarchies are of the past, and El Hassan is the voice of the future,\nsomething new. We won't admit he's just a latter-day tyrant, an\nopportunist seizing power because it's there crying to be seized.\nActually, El Hassan is in the tradition of Genghis Khan, Tamerlane,\nor, more recently, Napoleon. But he's a modern version, and we're not\ngoing to hang the old labels on him.\"\n\nIsobel had brought the coffee. \"I think you're right,\" she said.\n\n\"Sold,\" Homer agreed. \"So we aren't a monarchy. We're a tyranny.\" His\nface had begun by expressing amusement, but that fell off. He added,\n\"As a young sociologist, I never expected to wind up a literal\ntyrant.\"\n\nElmer Allen said, \"Wait a minute. See if I can remember this. Comes\nfrom Byron.\" He closed his eyes and recited:\n\n    \"The tyrant of the Chersonese\n       Was freedom's best and bravest friend.\n     That tyrant was Miltiades,\n       Oh that the present hour would lend\n     Another despot of the kind.\n     Such bonds as his were sure to bind.\"\n\nIsobel, pouring coffee, laughed and said, \"Why Elmer, who'd ever dream\nyou read verse, not to speak of memorizing it, you old sourpuss.\"\n\nElmer Allen's complexion was too dark to register a flush.\n\nHomer Crawford said, \"Yeah, Miltiades. Seized power, whipped the\nAthenians into shape to the point where they were able to take the\nPersians at Marathon, which should have been impossible.\" He looked\naround at the others, winding up with Elmer. \"What happened to\nMiltiades after Marathon and after the emergency was over?\"\n\nElmer looked down into his coffee. \"I don't remember,\" he lied.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a clicking from the first hover-lorry, and Cliff Jackson put\ndown his coffee, groaned his resentment at fate, and made his way to\nthe vehicle and the radio there.\n\nBey motioned with his head. \"That's handy, our still being able to\ntune in on the broadcasts the African Development Project makes to its\nteams.\"\n\nKenny said, \"Not that what they've been saying is much in the way of\nflattery.\"\n\nBey said, \"They seem to think we're somewhere in the vicinity of Bidon\nCinq.\"\n\n\"That's what worries me,\" Homer growled. He raked his right hand back\nthrough his short hair. \"If they think we're in Southern Algeria, what\nare these planes doing around here? We're hundreds of miles from Bidon\nCinq.\"\n\nBey shot him an oblique glance. \"That's easy. That plane that tried to\nclobber us, and these others that have been trying to search us out,\naren't really Reunited Nations craft. They're someone else.\"\n\nThey all looked at him. \"Who?\" Isobel said.\n\n\"How should I know? It could be almost anybody with an iron in the\nNorth African fire. The Soviet Complex? Very likely. The British\nCommonwealth or the French Community? Why not? There're elements in\nboth that haven't really accepted giving up the old colonies and would\nlike to regain them in one way or the other. The Arab Union? Why\ncomment? Common Europe? Oh, Common Europe would love to have a free\nhand exploiting North Africa.\"\n\n\"You haven't mentioned the United States of the Americas,\" Elmer said\ndryly. \"I hope you haven't any prejudices in favor of the land of your\nadoption, Mr. Minister of War.\"\n\nBey shrugged. \"I just hadn't got around to her. Admittedly with the\ncontinued growth of the Soviet Complex and Common Europe, the States\nhave slipped from the supreme position they occupied immediately\nfollowing the Second War. The more power-happy elements are conscious\nof the ultimate value of control of Africa and doubly conscious of the\ndanger of it falling into the hands of someone else. Oh, never fear,\nthose planes that have been pestering us might belong to anybody at\nall.\"\n\nCliff Jackson hurried back from his radio, his face anxious. \"Listen,\"\nhe said. \"That was a high priority flash, to all Reunited Nations\nteams. The Arab Union has just taken Tamanrasset. They pushed two\ncolumns out of Libya, evidently one from Ghat and one from further\nnorth near Ghadem\u00c3\u00a8s.\"\n\nHomer Crawford was on his feet, alert. \"Well ... why?\"\n\nCliff had what amounted to accusation on his face. \"Evidently, the El\nHassan rumors are spreading like wildfire. There've been more riots in\nMopti, and the Reunited Nations buildings in Adrar have been stormed\nby mobs demonstrating for him. The Arab Union is moving in on the\nexcuse of protecting the country against El Hassan.\"\n\nKenny Ballalou groaned, \"They'll have half their Arab Legion in here\nbefore the week's out.\"\n\nCliff finished with, \"The Reunited Nations is throwing a wingding.\nEverybody running around accusing and threatening, and, as per usual,\ngetting nowhere.\"\n\nHomer Crawford's face was working in thought. He shook his head at\nKenny. \"I think you're wrong. They won't send the whole Arab Legion\nin. They'll be afraid to. They'll want to see first what everybody\nelse does. They know they can't stand up to a slugging match with any\nof the really big powers. They'll stick it out for a while and watch\ndevelopments. We have, perhaps, two weeks in which to operate.\"\n\n\"Operate?\" Cliff demanded. \"What do you mean, operate?\"\n\nHomer's eyes snapped to him. \"I mean to recapture Tamanrasset from the\nArab Union, seize the radio and television station there, and proclaim\nEl Hassan's regime.\"\n\nThe big Californian's eyes bugged at him. \"You mean the six of us?\nThere'll be ten thousand of them.\"\n\n\"No,\" Homer said decisively. \"Nothing like that number. Possibly a\nthousand, if that many. Logistics simply doesn't allow a greater\nnumber, not on such short notice. They've put a thousand or so of\ntheir crack troops into the town. No more.\"\n\nCliff wailed, \"What's the difference between a thousand and twenty\nthousand, so far as five men and a girl are concerned?\"\n\nThe rest were saying nothing, but following the debate.\n\nCrawford explained, not to just Cliff but to all of them. \"Actually,\nthe Arab Union is doing part of our job for us. They've openly\ndeclared that El Hassan is attempting to take over North Africa, that\nhe's raising the tribes. Well, good. We didn't have the facilities to\nmake the announcement ourselves. But now the whole world knows it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That's right,\" Elmer said, his face characteristically sullen. \"Every\nnews agency in the world is playing up the El Hassan story. In a\nmatter of days, the most remote nomad encampment in the Sahara will\nknow of it, one way or the other.\"\n\nHomer Crawford was pacing, socking his right fist into the palm of the\nleft. \"They've given us a rallying _raison d'etre_. These people might\nbe largely Moslem, especially in the north, but they have no love for\nthe Arab Union. For too long the slave raiders came down from the\nnortheast. Given time, Islam might have moved in on the whole of North\nAfrica. But not this way, not in military columns.\"\n\nHe swung to Bey. \"You worked over in the Teda country, before joining\nmy team, and speak the Sudanic dialects. Head for there, Bey.\nProclaim El Hassan. Organize a column. We'll rendezvous at Tamanrasset\nin exactly two weeks.\"\n\nBey growled, \"How am I supposed to get to Faya?\"\n\n\"You'll have to work that out yourself. Tonight we'll drop you near In\nGuezzam, they have one of the big solar pump, afforestation\ndevelopments there. You should be able to, ah, requisition a truck, or\npossibly even a 'copter or aircraft. You're on your own, Bey.\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\nHomer spun to Kenny Ballalou. \"You're the only one of us who gets\nalong in the dialect of Hassania. Get over to Nemadi country and raise\na column. There are no better scouts in the world. Two weeks from\ntoday at Tamanrasset.\"\n\n\"Got it. Drop me off tonight with Bey, we'll work together until we\nliberate some transport.\"\n\nBey said, \"It might be worth while scouting in In Guezzam for a day or\ntwo. We might pick up a couple of El Hassan followers to help us along\nthe way.\"\n\n\"Use your judgment. Elmer!\"\n\nElmer groaned sourly, \"I knew my time'd come.\"\n\n\"Up into Chaambra country for you. Take the second lorry. You've got a\ndistance to go. Try to recruit former members of the French Camel\nCorps. Promise just about anything, but only remember that one day\nwe'll have to keep the promises. El Hassan can't get the label of\nphony hung on him.\"\n\n\"Chaambra country,\" Elmer said. \"Oh great. Arabs. I can just see what\nluck I'm going to have rousing up Arabs to fight other Arabs, and me\nwith a complexion black as ...\"\n\nHomer snapped at him, \"They won't be following you, they'll be\nfollowing El Hassan ... or at least the El Hassan dream. Play up the\nfact that the Arab Union is largely not of Africa but of the Middle\nEast. That they're invading the country to swipe the goats and violate\nthe women. Dig up all the old North African prejudices against the\nSyrians and Egyptians, and the Saudi-Arabian slave traders. You'll\nmake out.\"\n\nCliff said, nervously, \"How about me, Homer?\"\n\nHomer looked at him. Cliff Jackson, in spite of his fabulous build,\nhadn't a fighting man's background.\n\nHomer grinned and said, \"You'll work with me. We're going into Tuareg\ncountry. Whenever occasion calls for it, whip off that shirt and go\nstrolling around with that overgrown chest of yours stuck out. The\nTuareg consider themselves the best physical specimens in the Sahara,\nwhich they are. They admire masculine physique. You'll wow them.\"\n\nCliff grumbled, \"Sounds like vaudeville.\"\n\nIsobel said softly, \"And me, El Hassan? What do I do?\"\n\nHomer turned to her. \"You're also part of headquarters staff. The\nTuareg women aren't dominated by their men. They still have a strong\nelement of descent in the matrilinear line and women aren't\nsecond-class citizens. You'll work on pressuring them. Do you speak\nTamaheq?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nHomer Crawford looked up into the sky, swept it. The day was rapidly\ncoming to an end and nowhere does day become night so quickly as in\nthe ergs of the Sahara.\n\n\"Let's get underway,\" Crawford said. \"Time's a wastin'.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe range of the Ahaggar Tuareg was once known, under French\nadministration, as the Annexe du Hoggar, and was the most difficult\narea ever subdued by French arms--if it was ever subdued. At the\nbattle of Tit on May 7, 1902 the Camel Corps, under Cottenest, broke\nthe combined military power of the Tuareg confederations, but this\nmeant no more than that the tribes and clans carried on nomadic\nwarfare in smaller units.\n\nThe Ahaggar covers roughly an area the size of Pennsylvania, New York,\nVirginia and Maryland combined, and supports a population of possibly\ntwelve thousand, which includes about forty-five hundred Tuareg, four\nthousand Negro serf-slaves, and some thirty-five hundred scorned\nsedentary Haratin workers. The balance of the population consists of a\nhandful of Enaden smiths and a small number of Arab shopkeepers in the\nlargest of the sedentary centers. Europeans and other whites are all\nbut unknown.\n\nIt is the end of the world.\n\nContrary to Hollywood-inspired belief, the Sahara does not consist\nprincipally of sand dunes, although these, too, are present, and all\nbut impassable even to camels. Traffic, through the millennia, has\nheld to the endless stretches of gravelly plains and the rock ribbed\nplateaus which cover most of the desert. The great sandy wastes or\nergs cover roughly a fifth of the entire Sahara, and possibly two\nthirds of this area consists of the rolling sandy plains dotted\noccasionally with dunes. The remaining third, or about one fifteenth\nof the total Sahara, is characterized by the dune formations of\npopular imagination.\n\nIt was through this latter area that Homer Crawford, now with but one\nhover-lorry, and accompanied by Isobel Cunningham and Clifford\nJackson, was heading.\n\nFor although the spectacular major dune formations of the Great Erg\nhave defied wheeled vehicles since the era of the Carthaginian\nchariots, and even the desert born camel limits his daily travel in\nthem to but a few miles, the modern hovercraft, atop its air cushion\njets, finds them of only passing difficulty to traverse. And the\nhovercraft leaves no trail.\n\nCliff Jackson scowled out at the identical scenery. Identical for more\nthan two hundred miles. For twice that distance, they had seen no\nother life. No animal, no bird, not a sprig of cactus. This was the\nGreat Erg.\n\nHe muttered, \"This country is so dry even the morning dew is\ndehydrated.\"\n\nIsobel laughed--she, too, had never experienced this country before.\n\"Why, Cliff, you made a funny!\"\n\nThey were sitting three across in the front seat, with Homer Crawford\nat the wheel, and now all three were dressed in the costume of the Kel\nRela tribe of the Ahaggar Tuareg confederation. In the back of the\nlorry were the jerry-cans of water and the supplies that meant the\ndifference between life and mummification from sun and heat.\n\nCliff turned suddenly to the driver. \"Why here?\" he said bitterly.\n\"Why pick this for a base of operations? Why not Mopti? Ten thousand\nSudanese demonstrated for El Hassan there less than two weeks ago.\nYou'd have them in the palm of your hand.\"\n\nHomer didn't look up from his work at wheel, lift and acceleration\nlevers. To achieve maximum speed over the dunes, you worked constantly\nat directing motion not only horizontally but vertically.\n\nHe said, \"And the twenty and one enemies of the El Hassan movement\nwould have had us in their palms. Our followers in Mopti can take care\nof themselves. If this movement is ever going to be worth anything,\nthe local characters are going to have to get into the act. The\ncurrent big thing is not to allow El Hassan and his immediate troupe\nto be eliminated before full activities can get under way. For the\npresent, we're hiding out until we can gather forces enough to free\nTamanrasset.\"\n\n\"Hiding out is right,\" Cliff snorted. \"I have a sneaking suspicion\nthat not only will they never find us, but we'll never find them\nagain.\"\n\nHomer laughed. \"As a matter of fact, we're not so far right now from\nSilet where there's a certain amount of water--if you dig for it--and\na certain amount of the yellowish grass and woody shrubs that the\nbedouin depend on. With luck, we'll find the Amenokal of the Tuareg\nthere.\"\n\n\"Amenokal?\"\n\n\"Paramount chief of the Ahaggar Tuaregs.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe dunes began to fall away and with the butt of his left hand\nCrawford struck the acceleration lever. He could make more time now\nwhen less of his attention was drawn to the ups and downs of erg\ntravel.\n\nPatches of thorny bush began to appear, and after a time a small herd\nof gazelle were flushed and high tailed their way over the horizon.\n\nIsobel said, \"Who is this Amenokal you mentioned?\"\n\n\"These are the real Tuareg, the comparatively untouched. They've got\nthree tribes, the Kel Rela, the T\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9h\u00c3\u00a9 Mellet and the Taitoq, each\nheaded by a warrior clan which gives its name to the tribe as a whole.\nThe chief of the Kel Rela clan is also chief of the Kel Rela tribe and\nautomatically paramount chief, or Amenokal, of the whole\nconfederation. His name is Melchizedek.\"\n\n\"Do you think you can win him over?\" Isobel said.\n\n\"He's a smart old boy. I had some dealings with him over a year ago.\nGave him a TV set in the way of a present, hoping he'd tune in on some\nof our Reunited Nations propaganda. He's probably the most\nconservative of the Tuareg leaders.\"\n\nHer eyebrows went up. \"And you expect to bring him around to the most\nliberal scheme to hit North Africa since Hannibal?\"\n\nHe looked at her from the side of his eyes and grinned. \"Remember\nRoosevelt, the American president?\"\n\n\"Hardly.\"\n\n\"Well, you've read about him. He came into office at a time when the\ncountry was going to economic pot by the minute. Some of the measures\nhe and his so-called brain trust took were immediately hailed by his\nenemies as socialistic. In answer, Roosevelt told them that in times\nof social stress the true conservative is a liberal, since to\npreserve, you have to reform. If Roosevelt hadn't done the things he\ndid, back in the 1930s, you probably would have seen some _real_\nchanges in the American socio-economic system. Roosevelt didn't\nundermine the social system of the time, he preserved it.\"\n\n\"Then, according to you, Roosevelt was a conservative,\" she said\nmockingly.\n\nCrawford laughed. \"I'll go even further,\" he said. \"When social\nchanges are pending and for whatever reason are not brought about,\nthen reaction is the inevitable alternative. At such a time then--when\nsweeping socio-economic change is called for--any reform measures\nproposed are concealed measures of reaction, since they tend to\nmaintain the _status quo_.\"\n\n\"Holy Mackerel,\" Cliff protested. \"Accept that and Roosevelt was not\nonly not a liberal, but a reactionary. Stop tearing down my childhood\nheroes.\"\n\nIsobel said, \"Let's get back to this Amenokal guy. You think he's\nsmart enough to see his only chance is in going along with ...\"\n\nHomer Crawford pointed ahead and a little to the right. \"We'll soon\nfind out. This is a favorite encampment of his. With luck, he'll be\nthere. If we can win him over, we've come a long way.\"\n\n\"And if we can't?\" Isobel said, her eyebrows raised again.\n\n\"Then it's unfortunate that there are only three of us,\" Homer said\nsimply, without looking at her.\n\nThere were possibly no more than a hundred Tuareg in all in the nomad\nencampment of goat leather tents when the solar powered hovercraft\ndrew up.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWhen the air cushion vehicle stopped before the largest tent, Crawford\nsaid beneath his breath, \"The Amenokal is here, all right. Cliff,\nwatch your teguelmoust. If any of these people see more than your\neyes, your standing has dropped to a contemptible zero.\"\n\nThe husky Californian secured the lightweight cotton, combination veil\nand turban well up over his face. Earlier, Crawford had shown him how\nto wind the ten-foot long, indigo-blue cloth around the head and\nfeatures.\n\nIsobel, of course, was unveiled, Tuareg fashion, and wore baggy\ntrousers of black cotton held in place with a braided leather cord by\nway of drawstring and a gandoura upper-garment consisting of a huge\nrectangle of cloth some seven to eight feet square and folded over on\nitself with the free corners sewed together so as to leave bottom and\nmost of both sides open. A V-shaped opening for her head and neck was\ncut out of a fold at the top, and a large patch had been sewed inside\nto make a pocket beneath her left breast. She wasn't exactly a\nParisian fashion plate.\n\nEven as they stepped down from the hovercraft, immediately after it\nhad drifted to rest on the ground, an elderly man came from the tent\nentrance.\n\nHe looked at them for a moment, then rested his eyes exclusively on\nHomer Crawford.\n\n\"_La Bas_, El Hassan,\" he said through the cloth that covered his\nmouth.\n\nHomer Crawford was taken aback, but covered the fact. \"There is no\nevil,\" he repeated the traditional greeting. \"But why do you name me\nEl Hassan?\"\n\nA dozen veiled desert men, all with the Tuareg sword, several with\nmodern rifles, had formed behind the Tuareg chief.\n\nMelchizedek made a movement of hand to mouth, in a universal gesture\nof amusement. \"Ah, El Hassan,\" he said, \"you forget you left me the\nmagical instrument of the Roumi.\"\n\nCrawford was mystified, but he stood in silence. What the Tuareg\nparamount chief said now made considerable difference. As he recalled\nhis former encounter with the Ahaggar leader, the other had been\nneither friendly nor antagonistic to the Reunited Nations team\nCrawford had headed in their role as itinerant desert smiths.\n\nThe Amenokal said, \"Enter then my tent, El Hassan, and meet my\nchieftains. We would confer with you.\"\n\nThe first obstacle was cleared. Subduing a sigh of relief, Homer\nCrawford turned to Cliff. \"This, O Amenokal of all the Ahaggar, is\nClif ben Jackson, my Vizier of Finance.\"\n\nThe Amenokal bowed his head slightly, said, \"_La Bas_.\"\n\nCliff could go that far in the Tuareg tongue. He said, \"_La Bas_.\"\n\nThe Amenokal said, looking at Isobel, \"I hear that in the lands of the\nRoumi women are permitted in the higher councils.\"\n\nHomer said steadily, \"This I have also been amazed to hear. However,\nit is fitting that my followers remain here while El Hassan discusses\nmatters of the highest importance with the Amenokal and his\nchieftains. This is the Sitt Izubahil, high in the councils of her\npeople due to the great knowledge she has gained by attending the new\nschools which dispense rare wisdom, as all men know.\"\n\nThe Amenokal courteously said, \"_La Bas_,\" but Isobel held her peace\nin decency amongst men of chieftain rank.\n\nWhen Homer and the Tuaregs had disappeared into the tent, she said to\nCliff, \"Stick by the car, I'm going to circulate among the women.\nWomen are women everywhere. I'll pick up the gossip, possibly get\nsomething Homer will miss in there.\"\n\nA group of Tuareg women and children, the latter stark naked, had\ngathered to gape at the strangers. Isobel moved toward them, began\nimmediately breaking the ice.\n\nUnder his breath, Cliff muttered, \"What a gal. Give her a few hours\nand she'll form a Lady's Aid branch, or a bridge club, and where else\nis El Hassan going to pick up so much inside information?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe tent, which was of the highly considered mouflon skins, was\nmounted on a wooden frame which consisted of two uprights with a\nhorizontal member laid across their tops. The tent covering was\nstretched over this framework with its back and sides pegged down and\nthe front, which faced south, was left open. It was ten feet deep,\nfifteen feet wide and five feet high in the middle.\n\nThe men entered and filed to the right of the structure where\nsheepskins and rugs provided seating. The women and children, who\nabided ordinarily to the left side, had vanished for this gathering of\nthe great.\n\nThey sat for a time and sipped at green tea, syrup sweet with mint and\nsugar, the tiny cups held under the teguelmoust so as not to obscenely\nreveal the mouth of the drinker.\n\nFinally, Homer Crawford said, \"You spoke of the magical instrument of\nthe Roumi which I gave you as gift, O Amenokal, and named me El\nHassan.\"\n\nSeveral of the Tuareg chuckled beneath their veils but Crawford could\nread neither warmth nor antagonism in their amusement.\n\nThe elderly Melchizedek nodded. \"At first we were bewildered, O El\nHassan, but then my sister's son, Gu\u00c3\u00a9mama, fated perhaps one day to\nbecome chief of the Kel Rela and Amenokal of all the Ahaggar, recalled\nthe tales told by the storytellers at the fire in the long evenings.\"\n\nCrawford looked at him politely.\n\nMelchizedek's laugh was gentle. \"But each man has heard, in his time,\nO El Hassan, of the ancient Calif Haroun El Raschid of Baghdad.\"\n\nCrawford's mind went into high gear, as the story began to come back\nto him. From second into high gear, and he could have blessed these\nbedouin for handing him a piece of publicity gobblydygook worthy of\nFifth Avenue's top agency.\n\nHe held up a hand as though in amusement at being discovered.\n\"Wallahi, O Amenokal, you have discovered my secret. For many months I\nhave crossed the deserts disguised as a common Enaden smith to seek\nout all the people and to learn their wishes and their needs.\"\n\n\"Even as Haroun el Raschid in the far past,\" one of the subchiefs\nmuttered in satisfaction, \"used to disguise himself as a lowborn\ndragoman and wander the streets of Baghdad.\"\n\n\"But how did you recognize me?\" Homer said.\n\nThe Amenokal said in reproof, \"But verily, your name is on all lips.\nThe Roumi have branded you common criminal. You are to be seized on\nsight and great reward will be given he who delivers you to the\nauthorities.\" He spoke without inflection, and Crawford could read\nneither support nor animosity--nor greed for the reward offered by El\nHassan's enemies. He gathered the impression that the Tuareg chief was\nplaying his cards close to his chest.\n\n\"And what else do they say?\"\n\nThe elderly Melchizedek went on slowly, \"They say that El Hassan is in\ntruth a renegade citizen of a far away Roumi land and that he attempts\nto build a great confederation in North Africa for his own gain.\"\n\nOne of the others chuckled and said, \"The Roumi on the magical\ninstrument are indeed great liars as all can see.\"\n\nHomer looked at him questioningly.\n\nThe other said, laughing, \"Who has ever heard of a black Roumi? And\nyou, O El Hassan, are as black as a Bela.\"\n\nThe Amenokal finished off the mystery of Crawford's recognition.\n\"Know, El Hassan, that whilst you were here before, one of the slaves\nthat served you for pay shamelessly looked upon your face in the\nprivacy of your tent. It was this slave who recognized your face when\nthe Roumi presented it on the magic instrument, calling upon all men\nto see you and to brand you enemy.\"\n\nSo that was it. The Reunited Nations, and probably all the rest, had\nused their radio and TV stations to broadcast a warning and offer a\nreward for Homer and his followers. Old Sven was losing no time. This\nwasn't so good. A Tuareg owes allegiance to no one beyond clan, tribe\nand confederation. All others are outside the pale and any advantage,\nmonetary or otherwise, to be gained by exploiting a stranger is well\nwithin desert mores.\n\nHe might as well bring it to the point. Crawford said evenly, \"And I\nhave entered your camp alone except for two followers. Your people are\nmany. So why, O Amenokal, have you not seized me for the reward the\nRoumi offer?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a moment of silence and Homer Crawford sensed that the\nsub-chieftains had leaned forward in anticipation, waiting for their\nleader's words. Possibly they, too, could not understand.\n\nThe Tuareg leader finished his tea.\n\n\"Because, El Hassan, we yet have not heard the message which the Roumi\nare so anxious that you not be allowed to bring the men of the desert.\nThe Roumi are great liars, and great thieves, as each man knows. In\nthe memory of those still living, they have stolen of the bedouin and\nrobbed him of land and wealth. So now we would hear of what you say,\nbefore we decide.\"\n\n\"Spoken like a true Amenokal, a veritable Suliman ben Davud,\" Homer\nsaid with a heartiness he could only partly feel. At least they were\nopen to persuasion.\n\nFor a long moment he stared down at the rug upon which they sat, as\nthough deep in contemplation.\n\n\"These words I speak will be truly difficult to hear and accept, O men\nof the veil,\" he said at last. \"For I speak of great change, and no\nman loves change in the way of his life.\"\n\n\"Speak, El Hassan,\" Melchizedek said flatly. \"Great change is\neverywhere upon us, as each man knows, and none can tell how to\nmaintain the ways of our fathers.\"\n\n\"We can fight,\" one of the younger men growled.\n\nThe Amenokal turned to him and grunted scorn. \"And would you fight\nagainst the weapons of the djinn and afrit, O Gu\u00c3\u00a9mama? Know that in my\nyouth I was distant witness to the explosion of a great weapon which\nthe accursed Franzawi discharged south of Reggan. Know, that this\nsingle explosion, my sister's son, could with ease have destroyed the\ntotal of all the tribesmen of the Ahaggar, had they been gathered.\"\n\n\"And the Roumi have many such weapons,\" Crawford added gently.\n\nThe eyes of the tribal headmen came back to him.\n\n\"As each man knows,\" Crawford continued, \"change is upon the world. No\nmatter how strongly one wills to continue the traditions of his\nfathers, change is upon us all. And he who would press against the\nsand storm, rather than drifting with it, lasts not long.\"\n\nOne of the subchiefs growled, \"We Tuareg love not change, El Hassan.\"\n\nCrawford turned to him. \"That is why I and my viziers have spent long\nhours in _ekhwan_, in great council, devoted to the problems of the\nTuareg and how they can best fit into the new Africa that everywhere\nawakes.\"\n\nThey stirred in interest now. The Tuareg, once the Scourge of the\nSahara, the Sons of Shaitan and the Forgotten of Allah, to the Arab,\nTeda, Moroccan and other fellow inhabitants of North Africa, were of\nrecent decades developing a tribal complex. Robbed of their\nnomadic-bandit way of life by first the French Camel Corps and later\nby the efforts of the Reunited Nations, they were rapidly descending\ninto a condition of poverty and defensive bewilderment. Not only were\nlarge numbers of former bedouin drifting to the area's sedentary\ncenters, an act beyond contempt within the memory of the elders, but\nthe best elements of the clans were often deserting Tuareg country\ncompletely and defecting to the new industrial centers, the dam\nprojects, the afforestation projects, the new oases irrigated with the\nsolar-powered pumps.\n\n\"Speak, El Hassan,\" the Amenokal ordered. And unconsciously, he, too,\nleaned forward, as did his subchiefs. The Ahaggar Tuareg were reaching\nfor straws, unconsciously seeking shoulders upon which to lay their\nunsolvable problems.\n\n\"Let me, O chiefs of the Tuareg, tell of a once strong tribe of\nwarriors and nomads who lived in the far country in which I was born,\"\nCrawford said. The desert man loves a story, a parable, a tale of the\nstrong men of yesteryear.\n\nMelchizedek clapped his hands in summons and when a slave appeared,\ncalled for _narghileh_ water pipes. When all had been supplied, they\nrelaxed, bits in mouths and looked again at Homer Crawford.\n\n\"They were called,\" he intoned, \"the Cheyenne. The Northern Cheyenne,\nfor they had a sister tribe to the South. And on all the plains of\nthis great land, a land, verily, as large as all that over which the\nTuareg confederations now roam, they were the greatest huntsmen, the\ngreatest warriors. All feared them. They were the lords of all.\"\n\n\"Ai,\" breathed one of the older men. \"As were the Tuareg before the\ncoming of the cursed Franzawi and the other Nazrani.\"\n\n\"But in time,\" Crawford pursued, \"came the new ways to the plains, and\nthese men who lived largely by the chase began to see the lands fenced\nin for farmers, began to see large cities erected on what were once\ntribal areas, and to see the iron railroads of the new ways begin to\nspread out over the whole of the territory which once was roamed only\nby the Cheyennes and such nomadic tribes.\"\n\n\"Ai,\" a muffled mouth ejected.\n\nHomer Crawford looked at the younger Targui, Gu\u00c3\u00a9mama, the Amenokal's\nnephew. \"And so,\" he said, \"they fought.\"\n\n\"Wallahi!\" Gu\u00c3\u00a9mama breathed.\n\nHomer Crawford looked about the circle. \"Never has tribe fought as did\nthe Cheyenne. Never has the world seen such warriors, with the\nexception, of course, of the Ahaggar Tuareg. Never were such raids,\nnever such bravery, never such heroic deeds as were performed by the\nwarriors of the Cheyennes and their women, and their old people and\ntheir children. Over and over they defeated the cavalry and the\ninfantry of the newcomers who would change the old ways and bring the\nnew to the lands of the Cheyennes.\"\n\nThe bedouin were staring in fascination, their water pipes forgotten.\n\n\"And then...?\" the Amenokal demanded.\n\n\"The new ways taught the enemy how to make guns, and artillery, and\nfinally Gatling guns, which today we call machine guns. And once a\nbrave warrior might prevail against a common man armed with the\nweapons of the new ways, and even twice he might. But the numbers of\nthe followers of the new ways are as the sands of the Great Erg and in\ntime bravery means nothing.\"\n\n\"It is even so,\" someone growled. \"They are as the sands of the erg,\nand they have the weapons of the djinn, as each man knows.\"\n\n\"And what happened in the end, O El Hassan?\"\n\nHis eyes swept them all. \"They perished,\" Homer said. \"Today in all\nthe land where once the Cheyenne pursued the game there is but a\nhandful of the tribe alive. And they have become nothing people, no\nlonger warriors, no longer nomads, and they are scorned by all for\nthey are poor, poor, poor. Poor in mind and spirits, and in property\nand they have not been able to adjust to the ways of the new world.\"\n\nAir went out of the lungs of the assembled Tuareg.\n\nThe Amenokal looked at him. \"This is verily the truth, El Hassan?\"\n\n\"My head upon it,\" Crawford said.\n\n\"And why do you tell us of these Cheyenne, these great warriors of the\nplains of the land of your birth? The story fails to bring joy to\nhearts already heavy with the troubles of the Tuareg.\"\n\nIt was time to play the joker.\n\nCrawford said carefully, \"Because there was no need, O Amenokal of all\nthe Ahaggar, for the Cheyenne to disappear before the sandstorm of the\nfuture. They could have ridden before it and today occupy a position\nof honor and affluence in their former land.\"\n\nThey stared at him.\n\n\"And give up the old ways?\" Gu\u00c3\u00a9mama demanded. \"Become no longer\nnomads, no longer honorable warriors, but serfs, slaves, working with\none's hands upon the land and with the oil-dirty machines of the\nRoumi?\"\n\nThe chiefs muttered angrily.\n\nCrawford said hurriedly, \"No! Never! In our great conferences, my\nviziers and I decided that the Tuareg could never so change. The\nTuareg must die, as did the Northern Cheyenne before he would become a\ncity dweller, a worker of the land.\"\n\n\"Bismillah!\" someone muttered.\n\n\"Too often,\" Crawford explained, \"do the bringers of these things of\nthe future, be they Roumi or others, fail to utilize the potential\nservices of the people of the lands they over-sweep.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you, El Hassan,\" Melchizedek grumbled. \"There is\nno room for the Tuareg in this new world of bringing trees to the\ndesert, of the great trucks which speed across the erg a score of time\nthe pace of a _hejin_ racing camel, of larger and ever larger oases\nwith their great towns, their schools, their new industries. If the\nTuareg remains Tuareg, he cannot fit into this new world, it destroys\nthe old traditions, the old way which is the Tuareg way.\"\n\nHomer Crawford now turned on the pressure. His voice took on overtones\nof the positive, his personality seemed to reach out and seize them,\nand even his physical stature seemed to grow.\n\n\"Some indeed of the ways of the bedouin must go,\" he entoned, \"but the\nTuareg will survive under my leadership. A people who have throve a\nmillennium and more in the great wastes of the Sahara have strong\nsurvival characteristics and will blossom, not die, in my new world.\nKnow, O Melchizedek, that it has been decided that the Ahaggar Tuareg\nwill be the heart of my Desert Legion. In times of conflict, armed\nwith the new arms, and riding the new vehicles, they will adapt their\nold methods of warfare to this new age. In times of peace they will\npatrol the new forests, watching for fire and other disaster, they\nwill become herdsmen of the new herds and be the police and rescue\nforces of this wide area. As the Cheyennes of the olden times of the\nland of my birth could have become herdsmen and forest rangers and\nhave performed similar tasks had they been shown the way.\"\n\nHomer Crawford let his eyes go from one of them to the next, and his\npersonality continued to dominate them.\n\nThe Amenokal ran his thin, aged hand through the length of his white\nbeard beneath his teguelmoust and contemplated this stranger come out\nof the ergs to lead his people to still greater changes than those\nthey had thus far rebelled against.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCrawford realized that the Targui was divided in opinion and inwardly\nthe American was in a cold sweat. But his voice registered only\nsupreme confidence. \"Under my banner, all North Africa will be welded\ninto one. And all the products of the land will be available in\nprofusion to my faithful followers. The finest wheat for cous cous\nfrom Algeria and Tunis, the finest dates and fruits from the oases to\nthe north, the manufactured products of the factories of Dakar and\nCasablanca. For Africa has always been a poor land but will become a\nrich one with the new machines and techniques that I will bring.\"\n\nThe Amenokal raised a hand to stem the tide of oratory. \"And what do\nyou ask of us now, El Hassan?\"\n\nInstead of to the older man, Crawford turned his eyes to the face of\nGu\u00c3\u00a9mama, the leader of the young clansmen. \"Now my people are\ngathering to establish the new rule. Teda from the east, Chaambra from\nthe north, Sudanese from the south, Nemadi, Moors and Rifs from the\nwest. We rendezvous in ten days from now at Tamanrasset where the Arab\nLegion dogs have seized the city as they wish to seize all the lands\nof the Sahara and Sudan for the corrupt Arab Union politicians.\"\n\nCrawford came to his feet. His voice took on an edge of command. \"You\nwill address your scouts and warriors and each will ride off on the\nswiftest camels at your command to raise the Tuareg tribes. And the\nclans of the Kel Rela will unite with the Taitoq and the T\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9h\u00c3\u00a9 Mellet\nin a great harka at this point and we will ride together to sweep the\nArab Legion from the lands of El Hassan.\"\n\nGu\u00c3\u00a9mama was on his feet, too. \"Bilhana!\" he roared. \"With joy.\"\n\nThe others were arising in excitement, all but Melchizedek, who still\nstroked his gray streaked beard beneath his teguelmoust. The Amenokal\nhad seen much of desert war in his day and knew the horror of the new\nweapons possessed by the crack troops of the Arab Legion.\n\nBut his aged shoulders shrugged against the inevitable.\n\nCrawford said, the ring of authority in his voice. \"What does the\nAmenokal of all the Ahaggar say?\" He had no intention of antagonizing\nthe Tuareg chief by going over his head and directly to the people.\n\n\"Thou art El Hassan,\" Melchizedek said, his voice low, \"and\nundoubtedly it is fated that the Tuareg follow you, for verily there\nis no way else to go, as each man knows.\"\n\n\"Wallahi!\" Gu\u00c3\u00a9mama crowed jubilantly.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nV\n\nGu\u00c3\u00a9mama, nephew of Melchizedek the Amenokal of the Ahaggar Tuareg\nconfederation and fighting chief of the Kel Rela clan of the Kel Rela\ntribe, brought his Hejin racing camel to an abrupt halt with a smack\nof his mish'ab camel stick. He barked, \"_Adar-ya-yan_,\" in command to\nbring it to its knees, and slid to the ground before his mount had\ngroaned its rocking way to the sand.\n\nThe Tarqui was jubilant. His dark eyes sparked above his teguelmoust\nveil and he presented himself before Homer Crawford with the elan of a\nNapoleonic cavalryman before his emperor. Were red leather fil fil\nboots capable of producing a clicking of heels, that sound would have\nrung.\n\nCrawford said with dignity, \"Aselamu, Aleikum, Gu\u00c3\u00a9mama. Greeting to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Salaam Aleikum,\" the tribesman got out breathlessly. \"Your message\nspreads, O El Hassan. My men ride to eastward and westward and never a\ntent from here to Silet, from In Guezzam to Timissao but knows that El\nHassan calls. The Taitoq and the T\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9h\u00c3\u00a9 Mellet ride!\"\n\nHomer Crawford was standing before the hovercraft. The Amenokal's\ntribesmen had set up two large goat leather tents for his use and the\nthree Americans had largely withdrawn to their shelter. Crawford was\naware of the dangers of familiarity.\n\nCliff Jackson, who as usual had been monitoring the radio, came from\nthe hover-lorry and growled, \"What's he saying?\"\n\n\"The tribesmen are gathering as per instructions,\" Homer said in\nEnglish.\n\nJackson grunted, somewhat self-conscious of the Targui's admiring\ngaze. The Tuareg is the handsomest physical specimen of North Africa,\noften going to six foot of wiry manhood, but there was nothing in all\nthe Sahara to rival the build of Homer Crawford, not to speak of the\ngiant Cliff Jackson.\n\nCrawford turned back to the Tuareg chieftain. \"You please me well, O\nGu\u00c3\u00a9mama. Know that I have been in conference with my viziers on the\nRoumi device which enables one to speak great distances and that we\nhave decided that you are to head all the fighting clans of the\nAhaggar, and that you will ride at the left hand of El Hassan, as\nshield on shoulder rides.\"\n\nThe Targui, overwhelmed, made adequate pledges of fidelity, flowering\nwords of thanks, and then hurried off to inform his fellow tribesmen\nof his appointment.\n\nIsobel emerged from her tent. She looked at Homer obliquely, the sides\nof her mouth turning down. \"As shield on shoulder rides,\" she\ntranslated from the Tamaheq Berber tongue into English. \"Hm-m-m.\" She\ncast her eyes upward in memory. \"You aren't plagiarizing Kipling, are\nyou?\"\n\nCrawford grinned at her. \"These people like a well turned phrase.\"\n\n\"And who could turn them better than Rudyard?\" she said. Her voice\ndropped the bantering tone. \"What's this bit about making Gu\u00c3\u00a9mama\nwar-chief of the Tuareg? Isn't he on the young and enthusiastic\nside?\"\n\nCliff scowled. \"You mean that youngster? Why he can't be more than in\nhis early twenties.\"\n\nCrawford was looking after the young Targui who was disappearing into\nhis uncle's tent on the far side of the rapidly growing encampment.\n\n\"You mean the age of Napoleon in the Italian campaign, or Alexander at\nIssus?\" he asked. Isobel began to respond to that, but he shook his\nhead. \"He's the Amenokal's nephew, and traditionally would probably\nget the position anyway. He's the most popular of the young tribesmen,\nand it's going to be they who do the fighting. Having the appointment\ncome from El Hassan, and at this early point, will just bind him\ncloser. Besides that, he's a natural born warrior. Typical.\nEnthusiastic, bold, brave and with the military mind.\"\n\n\"What's a military mind?\" Cliff said.\n\n\"He can take off his shirt without unbuttoning his collar,\" Homer told\nhim.\n\n\"Very funny,\" Cliff grumbled.\n\nIsobel turned to the big Californian. \"What's on the radio, Cliff?\"\n\n\"Let's go get a cup of coffee,\" he said. \"All hellzapoppin.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey went into the larger of the two Tuareg tents, and Isobel poured\nwater from a girba into the coffee pot which she placed on a heat\nunit, flicking its switch. She said sarcastically, from the side of\nher mouth, \"A message, O El Hassan, from the Department of Logistics,\nsubdepartment Commissary of Headquarters of the Commander in Chief.\nUnless you get around to capturing some supplies in the near future,\nyour food is going to be prepared over a camel dung fire. This heat\nunit is fading out on me.\"\n\n\"Don't bother me with trivialities,\" Homer told her. \"I've got _big_\nthings on my mind.\"\n\nShe looked at him suspiciously. \"Hm-m-m. Such as what?\"\n\n\"Such as whether to put my face on the postage stamps profile or\nfull.\"\n\nShe said, under her breath, \"I shoulda known. Already, delusions of\ngrandeur.\"\n\n\"Holy Mackerel,\" Cliff protested. \"Aren't we ever serious around this\nplace? You two will wind up gagging with the firing squad.\"\n\nCrawford chuckled softly but let his face go serious. \"Sorry, Cliff.\nWhat's on your mind?\"\n\nCliff said impatiently, \"From the radio reports, the Arab Union is\nconsolidating its position. El Hassan is being discredited by the\nminute. Your followers were in control for a time in Mopti and Bamako,\nbut they're falling away because of lack of direction. The best way I\ncan put reports together, the Reunited Nations is in complete\nconfusion. Everybody accusing everybody of double-dealing.\"\n\nIsobel said dryly, \"Any other good news?\"\n\nCliff said glumly, \"Rumors, rumors, rumors. Half the marabouts in\nNorth Africa are proclaiming a jihad in support of the Pan-Islam\nprogram of the Arab Union. Listen, Homer, we've got to get the\nbacking of the Moslem leaders.\"\n\nHomer Crawford grunted. \"We need Islam in this part of the world like\nwe need a hole in the head. That's one of the things already wrong\nwith North Africa.\"\n\n\"What's wrong with Islam? It was probably the most dynamic religion\never to sweep the world.\"\n\n\"_Was_ is right,\" Crawford growled, now on one of his favorite peeve\nsubjects. \"The Moslem religion exploded out of Arabia with some new\nconcepts that set the world in ferment from India to Southern France.\nFor all practical purposes Islam _invented_ science. Sure, the Greeks\nhad logic and the Romans had engineering--without applying the\nGreek-style logic. But the Arabs amalgamated the two concepts to yield\nexperimental science. They were able to take the intellectual products\nof a dozen cultures and wield them into one. For a hundred years or so\nit looked as though they had something.\"\n\nWhen he hesitated for a moment, Isobel said, questioningly, \"And ...\"\n\n\"And they couldn't get away from that Q'ran of theirs. They took it\nseriously. They started off in their big universities, such as those\nat Fez, being the greatest scientists and scholars the world had ever\nseen. But the fundamentalists won out, and in a couple of hundred\nyears the only thing being taught at Fez was the Q'ran. To even\nsuggest that all necessary information isn't contained therein, is\nenough to have you clobbered. Islam became the most reactionary force\nto suppress progress in the civilized world. In fact, by this period\nin world history, we don't even think of the Moslem world as\nparticularly civilized.\"\n\nCliff said defensively, \"The Bible doesn't encourage original thinking\neither. A fundamentalist ...\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Crawford interrupted. \"Those elements who take the Bible the\nway Islam took the Q'ran wind up in the same rut. But _as a whole_,\nEurope was sparked enough by the original Islamic explosion that the\nRenaissance resulted, with what world results we all know. Be ...\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a roar of confusion outside. A blasting of guns, a shrieking\nof _Ul-Ul-Ul-Allah Akbar!_\n\nCrawford came to his feet unhappily. \"Another contingent of Tuareg,\"\nhe said. \"I'll have to give them a quick welcoming to the colors\nspeech.\"\n\nThe guns outside continued their booming.\n\n\"Confound it,\" he growled, \"I wish I could break them of that habit of\nblasting away their ammunition. They'll have better targets before the\nweek is out.\"\n\nHe pushed open the tent flap and, followed by Isobel and Cliff,\nemerged into the stretch of clearing between his tents and the\nhovercraft, and the growing Tuareg encampment. His diagnosis had been\ncorrect. A contingent of possibly two score Tuareg camelmen had come\na-galloping up, shaking rifles above their heads in a small scale\ngymhana, or fantasia as the Moors called them.\n\n\"At least it's a larger group than usual,\" Cliff said from behind.\n\"But at this rate, it'll still take a month for us to equal the Arab\nLegion in Tamanrasset.\" He added in disgust, \"And look at this bunch\nof ragamuffins. Half of them are carrying muzzleloaders.\"\n\nThe booming muskets and the cracking rifles suddenly began to fall off\nin intensity and the camelmen and the hordes of Tuareg women and naked\nchildren who had swarmed from the tents to greet them were falling\nsilent. Here and there a hand pointed upward.\n\nHomer, Cliff and Isobel swung their own eyes up to the sky in dreaded\nanticipation. The hover-lorry was camouflaged to blend in with the\nsands and rock outcroppings of this area, but it was possible that an\naircraft might have determined that this was El Hassan's base,\npossibly through some act of a traitor, in which case ...\n\nThey found the spot in the sky that the tribesmen were pointing out.\nIt seemed to move slowly for a military craft, but for that matter it\nmight be a helio-jet and considerably more dangerous, so far as they\nbeing spotted was concerned, than a fast moving fighter.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nGu\u00c3\u00a9mama, was barking to his men to take cover. Two days before\nCrawford had checked out several of the more bright-eyed on the flac\nrifle and now three of them ran to where it was set up at a high\npoint.\n\nBut hardly had the confused milling got under way than it fell off\nagain. Movement stopped, and the Tuareg faced the approaching dot in\nthe sky.\n\n\"Djinn...!\"\n\n\"Afrit...!\"\n\nCliff had darted back into the tent, now he emerged with binoculars.\n\n\"What the devil is it?\" Crawford snapped. Desert trained eyes were\nevidently considerably more effective than his own. He couldn't see\nwhat the tribesmen were gaping at.\n\n\"It's the smallest heliohopper _I've_ ever seen,\" Cliff snorted. \"It's\nso small practically all you can see are the rotors and the passenger.\nHe doesn't even look as though he's got a seat.\"\n\nGu\u00c3\u00a9mama came hurrying up, his eyes wide beneath his teguelmoust. \"El\nHassan! A witchman ... come out of the sky!\"\n\nHomer said evenly, \"It is nothing. Only post men ready to obey my\ncommands.\"\n\nGu\u00c3\u00a9mama hesitated as though to waver out another protest, but then\nspun and hurried off--military-like, glad to have an order to obey to\nkeep his mind from the impossible.\n\n\"I'm beginning to have a sneaking suspicion--\" Crawford began without\nfinishing. \"Come on Isobel, Cliff. We're going to have to make the\nmost of this.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRex Donaldson, ex-field man for the African Department of the British\nCommonwealth, dropped the lift lever of his heliohopper and settled to\nthe ground immediately before Homer Crawford who stood there flanked\nby Isobel Cunningham and Cliff Jackson. Further back and in the form\nof a crescent were possibly two or three hundred Tuareg of all ages\nand both sexes.\n\nDonaldson, in the garb of a Dogan juju man consisting of little more\nthan a wisp of cloth about his loins, played it straight, not knowing\nthe setup. On the face of it, he had just flown out of the sky\n_personally_. The size of his equipment so small as to be all but\nmeaningless.\n\nHe unstrapped himself from the thin, bicyclelike seat, and,\nexpressionlessly, folded the rotors of his tiny craft back over\nthemselves and the engine, collapsed the whole thing into a manageable\npacket of some seventy-five pounds, the seat now becoming a handle,\nand then turned and faced Crawford.\n\nDonaldson screwed his wizened face into an expression of respect and\nmade a motion of obeisance. Then he waited.\n\nIsobel said, \"El Hassan bids you speak.\"\n\nThat was the tip-off, then. Crawford had already revealed himself to\nthese people as El Hassan. Very well.\n\nDonaldson spoke in Arabic, not knowing the Tamaheq tongue. \"Aselamu,\nAleikum, El Hassan. I come to obey your wishes.\"\n\nA sigh had gone through the Tuareg. \"Aiiiii.\" _Wallahi, even the\ndjinn obeyed El Hassan!_\n\nWith dignity, Homer Crawford said, \"Keif halak, all in my house is\nyours.\"\n\nRex Donaldson inclined his small bent body again, in respect.\n\nCrawford said in English, \"Let's not carry this _too_ far. Come on\ninto the tent.\"\n\nIgnoring the Tuareg, who still gaped but held their distance, the four\nEnglish-speaking Negroes headed for the larger of the two tents that\nhad been set up for El Hassan.\n\nAs they passed Gu\u00c3\u00a9mama who stood slightly aside from the other Tuareg\nwith his uncle Melchizedek, the Amenokal, Crawford nodded and said,\nspeaking to them both. \"A messenger from my people to the south.\nContinue with your newly arrived warriors, O Gu\u00c3\u00a9mama.\"\n\nCliff Jackson had picked up the folded heliohopper and was now\ncarrying it easily.\n\nGu\u00c3\u00a9mama looked at the device and blinked.\n\nCrawford refrained from laughing at his commander of irregulars. \"It\nis not a _kambu_ device. My people deal not in magic. It is but one of\nthe many of the things the new ways bring. One day, Gu\u00c3\u00a9mama,\" Homer's\nface remained expressionless, \"perhaps you will fly thus.\"\n\nThe teguelmoust hid the other's blanch.\n\nIn the tent, Homer turned to the Bahaman, motioned to what seating\narrangements were available.\n\nIsobel said, \"I'll get some coffee.\"\n\nCliff blurted, \"Holy Mackerel, if Donaldson, here, can drop in on us\nout of a clear sky, what keeps anybody else from doing it? Somebody\nwith a couple of neopalm bombs in the way of calling cards.\"\n\nThe dried up little man grimaced in his equivalent of a grin and said,\n\"Hold it, you chaps. I want to notify the others.\"\n\n\"The others? What others?\" Crawford said.\n\nDonaldson ignored him for a moment, unslung the small bag he carried\nover one shoulder and dipped into it for a tiny, two-way radio. He\npressed the buzzer button, then held it up to his mouth. \"Jack, Jimmy,\nDave. Here we are. Took donkey's years, but I found them. You chaps\nzero-in here.\" He left the device on and set it to one side, then\nyawned and settled himself to the rug-covered ground, crosslegged,\nDogon style.\n\nHomer Crawford, even as he sat down himself on a footlocker, in lieu\nof a chair, rapped, \"How did you find us? Who did you just radio?\nWhere'd you come from?\"\n\n\"I say, hold it,\" Donaldson chuckled sourly. \"First of all, I've come\nto join up. I thought as far back as that time we co-operated in\nquelling the riots in Mopti that you ought to do this--proclaim\nyourself El Hassan. When I heard you'd taken the step, I came to join\nup.\"\n\n\"Oh, great,\" Cliff said. \"What took you so long? We hardly get here,\nto our ultra-secret hideout, than here you are.\"\n\nIsobel came with the coffee and handed it around, silently. Then she,\ntoo, settled to the rug which covered the sand of the floor.\n\nRex Donaldson turned to Cliff and there was a wrinkle of amusement in\nthe older man's eyes. \"I took so long, because I needed the time to\nrecruit a few other chaps I knew would stand with us.\"\n\nCrawford rapped, \"That's who you just radioed?\"\n\n\"Of course, old boy. I'd hardly bring the opposition down on us, would\nI?\"\n\n\"Where are they?\"\n\n\"In a couple of hovercraft, similar to your own, possibly twenty\nkilometers to the southwest.\"\n\n\"You still haven't told us how you found us?\"\n\nThe little man shrugged. \"After tendering my resignation to Sir\nWinton, I considered the possibilities, which narrowed down very\nquickly when I heard the Arab Legion had taken Tamanrasset.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Isobel said.\n\nDonaldson shot a glance at her. \"Because, my dear, unless El Hassan is\nable to retake Tamanrasset, his movement has come a cropper.\" He\nturned his eyes back to Crawford, who was nervously running his hand\nthrough his hair. \"I knew you had done considerable work in this area,\nso your whereabouts became obvious seeing that Tamanrasset is in\nTuareg country. It was simply a matter of finding what Tuareg\nencampment was your base, and since your quickest manner of gathering\nsupport would be to swing the Amenokal to your banner, I headed for\nhis usual encampment this time of year.\"\n\nCliff looked at Homer Crawford. \"If Rex found us so easily, so will\nanybody else.\"\n\nIsobel put in. \"Not necessarily. Mr. Donaldson has information that\nmost of El Hassan's opponents wouldn't.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHomer came to his feet unhappily and began pacing. \"No, Isobel.\nOstrander, for instance, has all the dope Rex has and is just as\ncapable of working it through to a conclusion. It takes no great\ninsight to realize El Hassan has to either put up or shut up when it\ncomes to Tamanrasset. That's possibly why some of the other elements\ninterested in North Africa have so far refrained from action against\nthe Arab Union. They want to see what El Hassan is going to do--find\nout just what he has on the ball.\"\n\nRex Donaldson looked at him interestedly, \"And? What are your plans?\"\n\nHomer Crawford's face worked. \"My plans right at present are to stay\nalive, and you finding me so easily isn't heartening. However, it\nbrings to mind some other problems which need solving, too.\"\n\nThe rest of them fell silent, looking at him. His usual casual humor\nhad dropped away, and his personality gripped them.\n\nHe stopped his pacing, and frowned down at them.\n\n\"El Hassan is going to have to remain on the move. Always. There can\nbe no capital city, no definite base, and it's going to be a poor idea\nto sleep twice in the same place.\" He shook his head emphatically as\nthough to deny rebuttal, which they hadn't actually made. \"El Hassan's\nenemies mustn't know his location within twenty miles.\"\n\n\"Twenty miles!\" Cliff blurted.\n\nCrawford stared at him, but unseeingly. \"Yes. At least half a dozen of\nour opponents possess nuclear weapons.\"\n\nDonaldson demured, sourly. \"A nuclear weapon hasn't been exploded for\ndonkey's years and--\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" Homer snapped. \"Nor would anyone dare, anywhere else\nexcept in the wastes of the Sahara. A nuclear explosion in the Ahaggar\nwould not go undetected and a controversy might go up in the Reunited\nNations. But who could prove who had done it? And who, actually, would\ncare if in the explosion a common foe of all was eliminated? But let\nthe Arab Union, or possibly the Soviet Complex, or even others, learn\ndefinitely where El Hassan is and a bomb could well devastate twenty\nsquare miles seeking him out.\" Crawford shook his head. \"No, we've\nsimply got to keep on the move.\"\n\nDonaldson said, even as he nodded agreement, \"And what other problems\nwere you talking about?\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Homer said. \"Well, keeping on the move will serve to add mystery\nto the El Hassan legend. It isn't good for this Tuareg encampment,\nfor instance, to see too much of El Hassan. A leader claiming\ndomination of half a continent looks small potatoes in a desert camp\nof a few score tents. On the move, showing up here, there, the other\nplace, for only a day or two at a time, is another proposition.\"\n\nHe thought a moment. \"Remember DeGaulle?\"\n\n\"How could we forget?\" Rex Donaldson said wryly.\n\n\"He had one angle that couldn't be more correct. He said a leader had\nto keep remote, ever mysterious. He can't afford to have real\nintimates. Napoleon, Hitler, Stalin. None of them had a real friend to\ntheir name. The nearest to friends that Adolph the Aryan ever had, his\nold comrades of the beerhall days, such as Rhoem, he butchered in the\nblood purge. And Stalin? He managed to do away with every Old\nBolshevik he knew in the days before the Party came to power.\"\n\nCliff was staring at him. \"Hey,\" he said. \"The one other thing one of\nthese mystical leader types needs is a belief in his own destiny. To\nthe point of clobbering all his intimates if he thinks they stand in\nhis way.\"\n\nHomer broke into a sudden short laugh. \"Any qualms, Cliff?\"\n\nCliff growled, \"I don't know. This dream of yours is growing. Where it\nmight end--I don't know.\"\n\nAs they were talking the cries of _Ul-Ul-Ul-Allah Akbar!_ had broken\nout again.\n\n\"Heavens to Betsy,\" Isobel said. \"Another contingent of camelmen?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut this time the newcomers were three in number and rode in air\ncushion hover-lorries, the twins of that used by Homer Crawford.\n\nRex Donaldson brought them up to the tent, saying, \"I didn't think you\nchaps were quite so close.\"\n\nHomer, Cliff and Isobel faced the new recruits. The three were dressed\nin khaki bushshirts, shorts and heavy walking shoes--British style.\nTwo were so obviously relatives that they could have been twins except\nfor an age discrepancy of two or three years. They were smaller in\nstature than the Americans present, almost chunky, but their faces\nheld education and cultivation. The third was slight of build, almost\nas wiry as Rex Donaldson, and seemed ever at ease.\n\nThe small, bent Bahaman made introductions. \"Gentlemen, let me present\nEl Hassan--Homer Crawford to you--formerly of the Reunited Nations\nAfrican Development Project, formerly of the United States of the\nAmericas.\" His face twisted in his sour grimace of a grin. \"Now\nrunning for the office of tyrant of North Africa.\"\n\n\"And these are two of his original and most trusted adherents, Isobel\nCunningham and Cliff Jackson.\" Donaldson turned to the newcomers.\n\"John and James Peters--that's Jack and Jimmy, of course--recently\ncolleagues of mine with the African Department of the Commonwealth,\nworking largely in the Nigeria area.\"\n\nHomer shook hands, grinning. \"You're a long way from home.\"\n\n\"Farther than that,\" the one labeled Jack said without a smile\nchanging the seriousness of his face. \"We're originally from\nTrinidad.\"\n\nDonaldson said, \"And this is David Moroka, late of South Africa.\"\n\nThe wiry South African said easily, \"Not so very late. In fact, I\nhaven't seen Jo-burg since I was a boy.\"\n\nHe was shaking hands with Isobel now. \"Jo-burg?\" she said.\n\n\"Johannesburg,\" he translated. \"I got out by the skin of my teeth\nduring the troubles in the 1950s.\"\n\n\"You sound like an American,\" Cliff said when it was his turn to\nshake.\n\n\"Educated in the States,\" Moroka said. \"Best thing that ever happened\nto me was to be kicked out of the land of my birth.\"\n\nHomer made a sweeping gesture at the floor and the few articles of\nfurniture the tent contained that could be improvised as chairs. \"I'm\nsurprised you're up here instead of in your own neck of the woods,\" he\nsaid to the South African.\n\nMoroka shrugged. \"I was considering heading south when I ran into\nJimmy and Jack, here. They'd already got the word on the El Hassan\nmovement from Rex. Their arguments made sense to me.\"\n\nEyes went to the brothers from Trinidad and Jack Peters took over the\nposition of spokesman. He said, seriously, as though trying to\nconvince the others, \"North Africa is the starting point, the\nbeginning. Given El Hassan's success in uniting North Africa, the\ncentral areas and later even the south will fall into line. Perhaps\none day there will be a union of _all_ Africa.\"\n\n\"Or at least a strong confederation,\" Jimmy Peters added.\n\nHomer nodded thoughtfully. \"Perhaps. But we can't look that far\nforward now.\" He looked from one of the newcomers to the other. \"I\ndon't know to what extent you fellows understand what the rest of us\nhave set out to accomplish but I suppose if you've been with Rex for\nthe past week, you have a fairly clear idea.\"\n\n\"I believe so,\" Jack nodded, straight-faced.\n\nHomer Crawford said slowly, \"I don't want to give you the wrong idea.\nIf you join up, you'll find it's no parade. Our chances were slim to\nbegin, and we've had some setbacks. As you've probably heard, the Arab\nUnion has stolen a march on us. And from what we can get on the radio,\nwe have thus far to pick up a single adherent among the world powers.\"\n\n\"_Powers?_\" Cliff snorted. \"We haven't got a nation the size of Monaco\non our side.\"\n\nMoroka shot a quick glance at the big Californian.\n\nIsobel caught it and laughed. \"Cliff's a perpetual sourpuss,\" she\nsaid. \"However, he's been in since the first.\"\n\nThe South African looked at her in turn. \"We were hardly prepared to\nfind a beautiful American girl in the Great Erg,\" he said.\n\nSomething about his voice caused her to flush. \"We've all caught\nHomer's dream,\" she said, almost defensively.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDavid Moroka flung to his feet, viper fast, and dashed toward Homer\nCrawford, his hands extended.\n\nAutomatically, Cliff Jackson stuck forward a foot in an attempt to\ntrip him--and missed.\n\nThe South African, moving with blurring speed, grasped the\nunsuspecting Crawford by the right hand and arm, swung with fantastic\nspeed and sent the American sprawling to the far side of the tent.\n\nHomer Crawford, old in rough and tumble, was already rolling out.\nBefore the inertia of his fall had given way, his right hand, only a\nsplit second before in the grip of the other, was fumbling for the 9\nmm Noiseless holstered at his belt.\n\nRex Donaldson, a small handgun magically in his hand, was standing,\nhalf crouched on his thin, bent legs. The two brothers from Trinidad\nhadn't moved, their eyes bugging.\n\nMoroka was spinning with the momentum of the sudden attack he'd made\non his new chief. Now there was a gun in his own hand and he was\ndarting for the tent opening.\n\nCliff yelled indignantly, \"Stop him!\"\n\nIsobel, on her feet by now, both hands to her mouth, was staring at\nthe goatskin tent covering, against which, a moment earlier, Crawford\nhad been gently leaning his back as he talked.\n\nThere was a vicious slash in the leather and even as she pointed, the\nrazor-sharp arm dagger's blade disappeared. There was the sound of\nrunning feet outside the tent.\n\nHomer Crawford had assimilated the situation before the rest. He, too,\nwas darting for the tent entrance, only feet behind Moroka.\n\nDonaldson followed, muttering bitterly under his breath, his face\ntwisted more as though in distaste than in fighting anger.\n\nCliff, too, finally saw light and dashed after the others, leaving\nonly Isobel and the Peters brothers. They heard the muffled coughing\nof a silenced gun, twice, thrice and then half a dozen times, blurting\ntogether in automatic fire.\n\nHomer Crawford shuffled through the sand on an awkward run, rounding\nthe tent, weapon in hand.\n\nThere was a native on the ground making final spasmatic muscular\nmovements in his death throes, and not more than three feet from him,\ncoolly, David Moroka sat, bracing his elbows on his knees and aiming,\ntwo-handed, as his gun emptied itself.\n\nCrawford brought his own gun up, seeking the target, and clipping at\nthe same time, \"We want him alive--\"\n\nIt was too late. Two hundred feet beyond, a running tribesman, long\narm dagger still in hand, stumbled, ran another three or four feet\nwith hesitant steps, and then collapsed.\n\nMoroka said, \"Too late, Crawford. He would have got away.\" The South\nAfrican started to his feet, brushing sand from his khaki bush\nshorts.\n\nThe others were beginning to come up and from the Tuareg encampment a\nrush of Gu\u00c3\u00a9mama's men started in their direction.\n\nCrawford said unhappily, looking down at the dead native at their\nfeet, \"I hate to see unnecessary killing.\"\n\nMoroka looked at him questioningly. \"Unnecessary? Another split second\nand his knife would have been in your gizzard. What do you want to\ngive him, another chance?\"\n\nCrawford said uncomfortably, \"Thanks, Dave, anyway. That was quick\nthinking.\"\n\n\"Thank God,\" Donaldson said, coming up, his wrinkled face scowling\nunhappily, first at the dead man at their feet, and then at the one\nalmost a hundred yards away. \"Are these local men? Where were your\nbodyguards?\"\n\nCliff Jackson skidded to a halt, after rounding the tent. He'd heard\nonly the last words. \"What bodyguards?\" he said.\n\nMoroka looked at Crawford accusingly. \"El Hassan,\" he said. \"Leader of\nall North Africa. And you haven't even got around to bodyguards? Do\nyou fellows think you're playing children's games? Gentlemen, I assure\nyou, the chips are down.\"\n\n\nVI\n\nEl Hassan's Tuaregs were on the move. After half a century and more of\nrelative peace the Apaches of the Sahara, the Sons of Shaitan and the\nForgotten of Allah were again disappearing into the ergs to emerge\nhere, there, and ghostlike to disappear again. They faded in and faded\naway again, and even in their absence dominated all.\n\nEl Hassan was on the move, as all men by now knew, and he, who was not\nfor the amalgamation of all North Africa, was judged against him. And\nwho, in the Sahara, could afford to be against El Hassan when his\nTuaregs were everywhere?\n\nRefugees poured into Tamanrasset for the security of Arab Legion arms,\nor into In Salah and Reggan to the north, or Agades and Zinder to the\nsouth. Refugees who had already taken their stand with the Arab Union\nand Pan-Islam. Refugees who were men of property and would know more\nof this El Hassan before risking their wealth. Refugees who took no\nstand, but dreaded those who drank the milk of war, no matter the\ncause for which they fought. Refugees who fled simply because others\nfled, for terror is a most contagious disease.\n\nColonel Midan Ibrahim of the crack motorized units of the Arab Legion\nwhich occupied Tamanrasset, was fuming. His task was a double one.\nFirst, to hold Tamanrasset and its former French stronghold Fort\nLaperrine; second, to keep open his lines of communication with\nGhadem\u00c3\u00a8s and Ghat, in Arab Union dominated Libya. To hold them until\nfurther steps were decided upon by his superiors in Cairo and the\nNear East--whatever these steps might be. Colonel Midan Ibrahim was\ntoo low in the Arab Union hierarchy to be in on such privy matters.\n\nHis original efforts, in pushing across the Sahara from Ghadem\u00c3\u00a8s and\nGhat, had been no more than desert maneuvers. There had been no force\nother than nature's to say him nay. The Reunited Nations was an\norganization composed possibly of great powers, but in supposedly\nacting in unison they became a shrieking set of hair-tearing women;\nthe whole being less than any of its individual parts. And El Hassan?\nNo more than a rumor. In fact, an asset because this supposed mystery\nman of the desert, bent on uniting all North Africa under his\ndomination, gave the Arab Union, its alibi for stepping in with\nColonel Ibrahim's men.\n\nYes, the original efforts had been but a drill. But now his Arab\nLegion troopers were beginning to face reality. The supply trucks,\ncoming down under convoy from Ghadem\u00c3\u00a8s, reported the water source at\nOhanet destroyed. The major well would take a week or more to repair.\nWho had committed the sabotage? Some said the Tuareg, some said local\nfollowers of El Hassan, others, desert tribesmen resentful of _both_\nthe Arab Union and El Hassan.\n\nOne of his routine patrols, feeling out toward Meniet to the north,\nhad suddenly dropped radio communication, almost in mid-sentence. A\nrelieving patrol had thus far found nothing, the armored car's tracks\ncovered over by the sands.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAnd rumors, rumors, rumors, Colonel Midan Ibrahim, born of\naristocratic Alexandrian blood, though trained to a sharp edge in Near\nEastern warfare, was basically city bred. The gloss of desert training\nmight take on him, but the bedouin life itself was not in his\nexperience, and it was hard for him to trace the dividing line between\npossibility and fantasy.\n\nRumors, rumors, rumors. They seemed capable of sweeping from one end\nof the Sahara to the other in a matter of hours. Faster, it would seem\nthan the information could be dispensed by radio. El Hassan was here.\nEl Hassan was there. El Hassan was marching on Rabat, in Morocco; El\nHassan had just signed a treaty with the Soviet Complex; El Hassan had\nbeen assassinated by a disgruntled follower. Or El Hassan was a\nrenegade Christian; El Hassan was a Moslem of Sheriffian blood, a\ndirect descendant of the Prophet; El Hassan was a pagan come up from\nDahomey and practiced ritual cannibalism; El Hassan was a Jew, a\nveteran of the Israel debacle.\n\nBut this Colonel Ibrahim knew--the Tuareg had gone over to the new\nmovement en masse. Something there was in El Hassan and his dream that\nhad appealed to the Forgotten of Allah. The Tuareg, for the first time\nsince the French Camel Corps had broken their strength, were\nunited--united and on the move.\n\nThe Tuareg were everywhere. In most sinister fashion--everywhere. And\nall were El Hassan's men.\n\nColonel Ibrahim fumed and wondered what kept his superiors from\nsending in additional columns, additional armored elements. And, above\nall, adequate air cover. Ha! Give the colonel sufficient aircraft and\nhe'd begin snuffing out bedouin life like candles--and bring the Peace\nof Allah to the Ahaggar.\n\nSo Colonel Ibrahim fumed, demanded further orders from mum superiors,\nand put his legionnaires to work on bigger and better gun\nemplacements, trenches and pillboxes surrounding Fort Laperinne and\nTamanrasset.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEl Hassan's personal entourage numbered exactly twenty persons. Of\nthese, five were his immediate English-speaking, Western-educated\nsupporters, Cliff, Isobel and the new Jack and Jimmy Peters and Dave\nMoroka. Rex Donaldson had been sent south again to operate in Senegal\nand Mali, to take over direction of the rapidly spreading movement in\nsuch centers as Bamako and Mopti and later, if possible, in Dakar.\n\nThe other fifteen were carefully selected Tuareg, picked from among\nGu\u00c3\u00a9mama's tribesmen taking care to show no preference to any tribe or\nclan, and taking particular care to choose men who fought coolly,\nunexcitedly, and didn't froth at the mouth when in action; men who\nwere slow to charge wildly into the enemy's guns--but slower still to\nretreat when the going was hot. El Hassan was prone to neither hero\nnor coward in his personal bodyguard.\n\nThey kept under movement. In Abelessa one day, almost in range of the\nmobile artillery of the Arab Legion; in Timassao the next, checking\nthe wells that meant everything to a desert force; the following day\nas far south as the Tamesna region to rally the less warlike\nIrreguenaten, a half-breed Tuareg people largely held in scorn by\nthose of the Ahaggar.\n\nHomer Crawford was killing time whilst stirring up as much noise and\ndust as his handful of followers could manage. Killing time until\nElmer Allen from the Chaambra country, Bey-ag-Akhamouk from the Teda,\nand Kenny Ballalou from the west could show up with their columns. He\nhad no illusions of how things now stood. At best, he could hold\ntogether a thousand Tuareg fighting men. No more. The economics of\ndesert life prevented him a larger force, unless he had the resources\nof the modern world at hand, and he didn't. Besides that, the Tuareg\nconfederation could provide no larger number of fighting men and at\nthe same time continue their desert economy.\n\nHe stood now with Isobel, Cliff and Dave Moroka in one of the western\ntype tents which the Peters brothers had brought with them in their\nhover-lorries, and poured over the half-adequate maps which covered\nthe area.\n\nDave Moroka traced with a finger. \"If we could dominate these wells\nrunning to Djanet, our Arab Union friends would have only their one\nline of supply going through Temassinine to Ghadem\u00c3\u00a8s. That's a long\nhaul, Homer.\"\n\nHomer Crawford scowled thoughtfully. \"That involves only four wells.\nIf Ibrahim's legionnaires staked out only three armored vehicles at\neach water hole, they could hold them. Our camelmen could never take\narmor.\"\n\nMoroka frowned, too. \"We've got to start _some_ sort of action, or the\nmen will start dribbling away.\"\n\nCliff Jackson said, \"Bey and Kenny and Elmer should be coming soon. I\nheard a radio item this morning about a big pro-El Hassan movement\nstarting in the Sudan among the Teda.\"\n\nMoroka said, \"We need some sort of quick, spectacular victory. The\nbedouin can lose interest as quickly as they can get steamed up, and\nthus far we haven't given them anything but words--promises.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" Homer growled, \"but there's nothing we can do right\nnow but mark time. Irritate the Arabs a bit. Keep them from spreading\nout.\"\n\nIsobel brought coffee, handing around the small Moroccan cups. She\nsaid, \"Well, one thing is certain. We get supplies soon or start\neating jerked goat and camel milk curds.\"\n\nMoroka said in irritation, \"It's not funny.\"\n\nIsobel raised her eyebrows. \"I didn't mean it to be. Have you ever\nbeen on a camel curd diet?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have,\" Moroka said impatiently. He turned back to Homer\nCrawford. \"How about waylaying an armored car or so, just in the way\nof giving the men something exciting to do?\"\n\nCrawford ran a hand back through his short hair. \"Confound it, Dave,\ncan you picture what a Recoilless-Brenn gun would do to a harka of our\ncharging camelmen? We can't let these people be butchered.\"\n\n\"I wasn't thinking of wild charges,\" Moroka argued.\n\nThey had both turned away from Isobel, in their discussion. Now she\nlooked at them, strangely. And especially at Homer Crawford. His\nbrusqueness toward her didn't seem the old Homer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a bustle from outside and a guardsman stuck his head in the\ntent entrance and reported in Tamaheq that a small camel patrol\napproached.\n\nThe four of them went out. Coming up were a dozen Tuareg and two motor\nvehicles.\n\nCliff said, \"Something new.\"\n\nMoroka said, \"We can use the transport.\"\n\n\"Let's see who they are, before we start requisitioning their\nproperty,\" Homer said dryly.\n\nThe two desert trucks had hardly come to a halt before the camouflaged\ntents and hover-lorries of El Hassan's small encampment before a\nheavy-set, gray haired Negro, whose energy belied his weight, bounced\ndown from the seat adjacent to the driver's in the lead vehicle and\nstomped belligerently to the group before the tent.\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" he snapped.\n\nHomer Crawford looked at him. \"I'm sure I don't know as yet, Dr.\nSmythe. Neither you nor these followers of mine have informed me as to\nwhat has transpired. Won't you enter my quarters here and we'll go\ninto it under more comfortable conditions?\" He glanced upward at the\nmidday Saharan sun.\n\nThe other seemed taken aback at Crawford calling him by name. He\nsquinted at the man who was seemingly his captor.\n\n\"Crawford!\" he snapped. \"Dr. Homer Crawford! See here, what is the\nmeaning of this?\"\n\nHomer said, \"Dr. Warren Harding Smythe, may I present Isobel\nCunningham, Clifford Jackson and David Moroka, of my staff?\"\n\n\"Huuump. I met Miss Cunningham and, I believe, Mr. Jackson at that\nridiculous meeting in Timbuktu, a short time ago.\" The doctor peered\nover his glasses at Moroka.\n\nThe wiry South African nodded his head. \"A pleasure, Doctor.\" He held\nopen the tent entrance.\n\nSmythe snorted again and stomped inside to escape the sun's glare.\n\nIn the shade of the tent's interior, Isobel clucked at him and hurried\nto get a drink of water from a moist water cooler. Homer Crawford\nmotioned the other to a seat, and took one himself. \"Now then, Dr.\nSmythe.\"\n\nThe indignant medic blurted, \"Those confounded bandits out there--\"\n\n\"Irregular camel cavalry,\" Crawford amended gently.\n\n\"They've kidnapped me and my staff. I demand that you intercede, if\nyou have any influence with them.\"\n\n\"What were you doing?\" Crawford was frowning at the other. Actually,\nhe had no idea of the circumstances under which the probably\noverenthusiastic Tuareg troopers had rounded up the American medical\nman.\n\n\"Doing? You know perfectly well I represent the American Medical\nRelief. My team has been in the vicinity of Silet, working with the\nnomads. The country is rife with everything from rickets to syphilis!\nEighty per cent of these people suffer from trachoma. My team--\"\n\n\"Just a moment,\" Moroka said. \"You mean out in those two trucks you\nhave a complete American medical setup? Assistants and all?\"\n\nSmythe said stiffly, \"I have two American nurses with me and four\nAlgerians recruited in Oran. This sort of interference with my work is\ninsufferable and--\"\n\nThe South African was staring at Homer Crawford.\n\nCliff Jackson cleared his throat. \"It seems as though El Hassan has\njust acquired a Department of Health.\"\n\n\"El Hassan?\" Smythe stuttered. \"What, what?\"\n\nIsobel said softly, \"Dr. Smythe, surely you have heard of El Hassan.\"\n\n\"Heard of him? I've heard of nothing else for the past month!\nConfounded ignorant barbarian. What this part of the world needs is\n_less_ intertribal, interracial, international fighting, not more. The\nman's a raving lunatic and--\"\n\nIsobel said gently, \"Doctor ... may I introduce you to El Hassan?\"\n\n\"What ... what--?\" For the briefest of moments, there was an element\nof timorness in the sputtering doctor's voice. Then suddenly he\ncomprehended.\n\nHe pointed at Homer Crawford accusingly. \"You're El Hassan!\"\n\nHomer nodded, seriously, \"That's correct, Doctor.\"\n\nThe doctor's eyes went around the four of them. \"You've done what you\nwere driving at there at that meeting in Timbuktu. You're trying to\nunite these people in spite of themselves and then drag them,\nwilly-nilly, into the twentieth century.\"\n\nHomer still nodded.\n\nSmythe shook an indignant finger at him. \"I told you then, Crawford,\nand I tell you now. These natives are not suited for such sudden\nchange. Already they are subject to mass neurosis because they cannot\nadjust to a world that changes too quickly.\"\n\n\"I wonder if that doesn't apply to the rest of us as well,\" Cliff said\nunhappily. \"But the changes go on, if we like them or not. Can you\nthink of any way to turn them off?\"\n\nThe doctor snorted.\n\nHomer Crawford said, \"Dr. Smythe, the die is already cast. The\nquestion now becomes, will you join us?\"\n\n\"Join you! Certainly not!\"\n\nCrawford said evenly, \"Then I might suggest that, first, you will not\nbe allowed to operate in my territory.\" He considered for a moment,\ngrinning inwardly, but on the surface his expression serene. He added,\n\"And second, that you will probably have difficulties procuring an\nexit visa from my domains.\"\n\n\"Exit visa! Are you jesting? See here, my good man, you realize I am a\ncitizen of the United States of the Americas and--\"\n\n\"A country,\" Homer yawned, \"with which I have not as yet opened\ndiplomatic relations, and hence has little representation in North\nAfrica.\"\n\nThe doctor was bug-eying him. He began sputtering again. \"This isn't\nfunny. You're an American citizen yourself. And you, Miss Cunningham\nand--\"\n\nIsobel said sadly, \"As a matter of fact, the last we heard, the State\nDepartment representative told us our passports were invalid.\"\n\nCrawford leaned forward. \"Look here, Doctor. You don't see eye to eye\nwith us on matters socio-economic. However, as a medical man, I submit\nthat joining my group ... ah, that is, until you can secure an exit\nvisa from my authorities ... will give you an excellent opportunity to\npractice your science here in the Sahara under the wing of El Hassan.\nI'll assign a place for your trucks and tents. Please consider the\nquestion and let me have your answer at your leisure. Meanwhile, we\nwill prepare a desert feast suitable to the high esteem in which we\nhold you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey looked after the doctor, as he left, and Moroka chuckled.\nHowever, Isobel was watching Homer Crawford quizzically.\n\nShe said finally, \"We rode over him a little in the roughshod manner,\ndidn't we?\"\n\nHomer Crawford growled uncomfortably, \"Particularly when we finally\nhave our showdown with the Arab Legion, a medic will be priceless.\"\n\nIsobel said softly, \"And the end justifies the means--\"\n\nHomer shot a quick, impatient look at her. \"The good doctor and his\npeople are in the Sahara to work with the Tuareg and the Teda and the\nrest of the bedouin. Beyond that, he has the same dream we have--of\ndeveloping this continent of our racial background.\"\n\n\"But he doesn't believe in your methods, Homer, and we're forcing him\nto follow El Hassan's road in spite of his beliefs.\"\n\nMoroka had been peering at the two of them narrowly. \"You don't make\nomelets without breaking eggs,\" he said, his voice on the overbearing\nside.\n\nShe spun on him. \"But the omelets don't turn out so well if some of\nthe eggs you use are rotten.\"\n\nThe South African's voice turned gentle. \"Miss Cunningham,\" he said,\n\"working in the field, like this, can have its rugged side for a young\nand delicate woman--\"\n\n\"_Delicate!_\" she snapped. \"I'll have you know--\"\n\n\"Hey, everybody, hold it,\" Cliff injected. \"What goes on?\"\n\nDave Moroka shrugged. \"It just seems to me that Isobel might do better\nback in Dakar, or in New York with your friend Jake Armstrong.\nSomewhere where her sensibilities wouldn't be so bruised, and where\nher assets\"--his eyes went up and down her lithe body--\"could be put\nto better use.\"\n\nIsobel's sepia face had gone a shade or more lighter. She said, very\nflatly, \"My assets, Mr. Moroka, are in my head.\"\n\nHomer Crawford said disgustedly, \"O.K., O.K., let's all knock it off.\"\n\nHis eyes flicked back and forth between them, in definite command. \"I\ndon't want to hear any more in the way of personalities between you\ntwo.\"\n\nMoroka shrugged again. \"Yes, sir,\" he said without inflection.\n\nIsobel turned away and took up some paperwork, without further words.\nShe suppressed her feeling of seething indignation.\n\nHomer Crawford, under his pressures, was changing. Possibly, she had\ntold herself before, it was change for the better. The need was for a\n_strong_ man, perhaps even a ruthless one.\n\nThe Homer Crawford she had first known was an easier going man than\nhe who had snapped an abrupt order to her a moment ago. The Homer she\nhad first known requested things of his teammates and friends. El\nHassan had learned to command.\n\nThe Homer she had first known could never have ridden, roughshod, over\nthe basically gentle Dr. Smythe.\n\nThe Homer she had first known, when the El Hassan scheme was still\naborning, had thought of himself as a member of a team. He was quick\nto ask advice of all, and quick to take it if it had validity. Now\nHomer, as El Hassan, was depending less and less upon the opinions of\nthose surrounding him, more and more upon his own decisions which he\nseemed to sometimes reach purely through intuition.\n\nThe El Hassan dream was still upon her, but, womanlike, she wondered\nif she liked the would-be tyrant of all North Africa as well as she\nhad once liked the easy-going American idealist, Homer Crawford.\n\nJack and Jimmy Peters, the brothers from Trinidad, entered, the former\ncarrying a couple of books.\n\nThey'd evidently failed to note the raised voices and wore their\ncustomary serious expressions. Jack looked at Homer and said, \"_Cu vi\nscias Esperanton?_\"\n\nHomer Crawford's eyebrows went up but he said, \"_Jes, mi parolas\nEsperanto tre bona, mi pensas._\"\n\n\"_Bona_,\" Jack said, \"_Tre bona_.\"\n\n\"_Jes, estas bele_,\" his brother said.\n\nMoroka was scowling back and forth from one of them to the other. \"I\nthought I had a fairly good working knowledge of the world's more\ncommon languages,\" he said, \"but that goes by me. It sounds like a\ncross between Italian and pig-Latin.\"\n\nHomer said to the Peters brothers, \"Let's drop Esperanto so that Dave,\nIsobel and Cliff can follow us. We can give it a whirl later, if you'd\nlike, just for the practice.\"\n\nIsobel said slowly, \"_Mi parolas Esperanto, malgranda_.\" Then in\nEnglish, \"I took it for kicks while I was still in school. Kind of\nrusty now, though.\"\n\n\"Esperanto?\" Cliff said. \"You mean that gobblydygook so-called\ninternational language?\"\n\nJack Peters looked at him, serious faced as always. \"What is wrong\nwith an international language, Mr. Jackson?\"\n\nCliff was taken aback. \"Search me. But it doesn't seem to have proved\nvery practical. It didn't catch on.\"\n\n\"Well, more than you might think,\" Isobel told him. \"There are\nprobably hundreds of thousands of persons in one part of the world or\nanother who can get along in Esperanto.\"\n\nMoroka said impatiently, \"What're a few hundred thousands of people in\na world population like ours? Cliff's right. It never took hold.\"\n\nHomer said, \"All right, Jack and Jimmy. You boys evidently have\nsomething on your minds. Let everybody sit down and listen to it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEven before they got thoroughly settled, Jack Peters was launching\ninto his pitch.\n\n\"We need an official language,\" he said. \"The El Hassan movement has\nset as a goal the uniting of all North Africa. We might start here in\nthe Sahara, but it's just a start. Ultimately, the idea is to reach\nfrom Morocco to Egypt and from the Mediterranean to ... to where? The\nCongo?\"\n\n\"Actually, we've never set exact limits,\" Homer said.\n\n\"Ultimately _all Africa_,\" Dave Moroka muttered softly. He ignored the\nmanner in which Isobel contemplated him from the side of her eyes.\n\n\"All right,\" the West Indian said. \"There are more than seven hundred\nmajor languages, not counting dialects, in Africa. Sooner or later, we\nneed an official language, what is it going to be?\"\n\n\"Why _one_ official language? Why not several?\" Cliff scowled. \"Say\nArabic, here in this area. Swahili on the East coast. And, say,\nSonghoi along the Niger, and Wolof, the Senegalese lingua franca,\nand--\"\n\n\"You see,\" Peters interrupted. \"Already you have half a dozen and you\nhaven't even got out of this immediate vicinity as yet. Let me develop\nmy point.\"\n\nHomer Crawford was becoming interested. \"Go on, Jack,\" he said.\n\nJack Peters pointed a finger at him. \"To be the hero-symbol we have in\nmind, El Hassan is going to have to be able to communicate with _all_\nof his people. He's not going to be able to speak Arabic to, say, a\nMasai in Kenya. They hate the Arabs. He's not going to be able to\nspeak Swahili to a Moroccan, they've never heard of the language. He\ncan't speak Tamaheq to the Imraguen, they're scared to death of the\nTuareg.\"\n\nHomer said thoughtfully, \"A common language would be fine. It'd solve\na lot of problems. But it doesn't seem to be in the cards. Why not\nadopt as our official language the one in which the _most_ of our\npeople will be able to communicate? Say, Arabic?\"\n\nJack was shaking his head seriously. \"And antagonize all the Arab\nhating Bantu in Africa? It's no go, Homer.\"\n\n\"Well, then, say French--or English.\"\n\n\"English is the most international language in the world,\" Moroka\nsaid. But his face was thoughtful, as those of the others were\nbecoming.\n\nThe West Indian was beginning to make his points now. \"No, any of the\nEuropean languages are out. The white man has been repudiated.\nAdopting English, French, Spanish, Portuguese or Dutch, as our\nofficial language would antagonize whole sections of the continent.\"\n\n\"Why Esperanto?\" Cliff scowled. \"Why not, say, Nov-Esperanto, or Ido,\nor Interlingua?\"\n\nJimmy Peters put in a word now. \"Actually, any one of them would\npossibly do, but we have a head start with Esperanto. Some years ago\nboth Jack and I became avid Esperantists, being na\u00c3\u00afve enough in those\ndays to think an international language would ultimately solve all\nman's problems. And both Homer and Isobel seem to have a working\nknowledge of the language.\"\n\nHomer said, \"So have the other members of my former Reunited Nations team.\nThat's where those books you found came from. Elmer, Bey, Kenny ... and\nAbe ... and I used to play around with it when we were out in the desert,\njust to kill time. We also used it as sort of a secret language when we\nwanted to communicate and didn't know if those around us might understand\nsome English.\"\n\n\"I still don't get the picture,\" Cliff argued. \"If we picked the most\ncommon half a dozen languages in the territory we cover, then millions\nof these people wouldn't have to study a second language. But if you\nadapt Esperanto as an official language then _everybody_ is going to\nhave to learn something new. And that's not going to be easy for our\nninety-five per cent illiterate followers.\"\n\nIsobel said thoughtfully, \"Well, it's a darn sight easier to learn\nEsperanto than any other language we decided to make official.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Cliff said argumentatively.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJack Peters took over. \"Because it's almost unbelievably easy to\nlearn. English, by the way, is extremely difficult. For instance,\nspelling and pronunciation are absolutely phonetic in Esperanto and\nthere are only five vowel sounds where most national languages have\ntwenty or so. And each sound in the alphabet has one sound only and\nany sound is always rendered by the same letter.\"\n\nDave Moroka said, \"Actually, I don't know anything at all about this\nEsperanto.\"\n\nThe West Indian took him in, with a dominating glance. \"Take grammar and\nsyntax which can take up volumes in other languages. Esperanto has exactly\nsixteen short rules. And take vocabularies. For instance, in English we\noften form the feminine of a noun by adding _ess--actor-actress_,\n_tiger-tigress_. But not always. We don't say _bull-bulless_ or\n_ghost-ghostess_. In Esperanto you simply add the feminine ending to any\nnoun--there's no exception to any rule.\"\n\nJack Peters was caught up in his subject. \"Still comparing it to\nEnglish, realize that spelling and pronunciation in English are highly\nirregular and one letter can have several different sounds, and one\nsound may be represented by different letters. And there are even\nsilent letters which are written but not pronounced like the _ugh_ in\n_though_. There are none of these irregularities in Esperanto. And the\nsounds are all sharp with none of such subtle differences as, say,\n_bed\/bad\/bard\/bawd_, that sort of thing.\"\n\nJimmy Peters said, \"The big item is that any averagely intelligent\nperson can begin speaking Esperanto within a few hours. Within a week\nof even moderate study, say three or four hours a day, he's\nastonishingly fluent.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIsobel said thoughtfully, \"There'd be international advantages. It's\nalways been a galling factor in Africans dealing with Europeans that\nthey had to learn the European language involved. You couldn't expect\nyour white man to learn kitchen kaffir, or Swahili, or whatever, not\nwhen you got on the diplomatic level.\"\n\nCliff Jackson was thinking out loud. \"So far, El Hassan is an unknown.\nRumor has it that he's everything from a renegade Egyptian, to an\nescaped Mau-Mau chief, to a Senegalese sergeant formerly in the French\nWest African forces. But when he starts running into the press and\nthey find that Homer and his closest associates all speak English, and\nmost of them with an American accent, there's going to be some fat in\nthe fire.\"\n\n\"And El Hassan will have lost some of his mysterious glamour,\" Homer\nadded thoughtfully.\n\nEven Moroka, the South African, was beginning to accept the idea. \"If\nEl Hassan, himself, refused in the presence of foreigners ever to\nspeak anything but Esperanto, the aura of mystery would continue.\"\n\nJimmy Peters, elaborating and obviously pushing an opinion he and his\nbrother had already discussed, said, \"We make it a rule that every\nschool, both locally taught and foreign, must teach Esperanto as a\nrequired subject. All El Hassan governmental affairs would be\nconducted in that language. Anybody at all trying to get anywhere in\nthe new regime would have to learn the official inter-African tongue.\"\n\n\"Oh, brother,\" Cliff groaned, \"that means me.\" He brightened. \"We\nhaven't any books or anything, as yet.\"\n\nIsobel laughed at him. \"I'll take on your studies, Cliff. We have a\nfew books. Those that Homer and his team used to kill time with. And\nas soon as we're in a position to make requests for foreign aid of the\ngreat powers, Esperanto grammars, dictionaries and so forth can be\nhigh on the list.\"\n\nWith a sharp cry, almost a bark, a figure jumped into the entrance and\nwith a bound into the center of the tent, sub-machinegun in hand.\n\"_All right, everybody. On your feet. The place is raided!_\"\n\nDave Moroka leaped to his feet, his hand tearing with blurring speed\nfor his holstered hand gun. \"Where's that bodyguard?\" he yelled.\n\n\nVII\n\n\"Hold it,\" Homer Crawford roared, jumping to his own feet and grabbing\nthe South African in his arms. He glared at the newcomer. \"Kenny, you\nidiot, you're lucky you don't have a couple of holes in you.\"\n\nKenny Ballalou, grinning widely, stared at Dave Moroka. \"Jeepers,\" he\nsaid, \"you got that gun out fast. Don't you ever stick 'em up when\nsomebody has the drop on you?\"\n\nDave Moroka relaxed, the side arm dropping back into its holster.\nHomer Crawford released him and the South African ran a hand over his\nmouth and shook his head ruefully at Kenny.\n\nIsobel and Cliff crowded up, the one to kiss Kenny happily, the other\nto pound him on the back.\n\nHomer made introductions to Dave Moroka and the Peters brothers.\n\n\"I've told you about Kenny,\" he wound it up. \"I sent him over to the\nwest to raise a harka of Nemadi to help in taking Tamanrasset.\" He\njoined Cliff Jackson in giving the smaller man an affectionate blow on\nthe shoulder. \"What luck did you have, Kenny?\"\n\nKenny Ballalou rubbed himself ruefully. \"If you two will stop beating,\nI'll tell you. I didn't recruit a single Nemadi.\"\n\nHomer Crawford looked at him.\n\nKenny said to the tent at large. \"Anybody got a drink around here?\nGood grief, have I been covering ground.\"\n\nIsobel bustled off to a corner where she'd amassed most of their\nremaining European type supplies, but she kept her attention on him.\n\nDave Moroka said, his voice unbelieving, \"You mean you haven't brought\nany assistance _at all_?\"\n\nKenny grinned around at them. \"I didn't say that. I said I didn't\nrecruit any of the Nemadi. I never even got as far as their\nterritory.\"\n\nHomer Crawford sank back onto the small crate he'd been using as a\nchair before Kenny's precipitate entrance. \"O.K.,\" he said, \"stop\ndramatizing and let us know what happened.\"\n\nKenny spread his hands in a sweeping gesture. \"The country's alive\nfrom here to Bidon Cinq and south to the Niger. Bourem and Gao have\ngone over to El Hassan and a column of followers was descending on\nNiamey. They should be there by now. I never got as far as Nemadi\ncountry. I could have recruited ten thousand fighting men, but I\ndidn't know what we'd do with them in this country. So I weeded\nthrough everybody who volunteered and took only veterans. Men who'd\nformerly been in the French forces, or British, or whatever. Louis\nWallington and his team were in Bourem when I got there and--\"\n\n\"Who is Louis Wallington?\" Jack Peters said.\n\nHomer looked over at the Peters brothers and Dave Moroka. \"Head of a\nsix-man Sahara Development Project team like the one I used to head.\"\nHis eyes went back to Kenny. \"What about Louis?\"\n\n\"He's come in with us. Didn't know how to get in touch, so he was\nworking on his own. And Pierre Dupaine. Remember him, the fellow from\nGuadeloupe in the French West Indies, used to be an operative of the\nAfrican Affairs sector of the French Community? Well, he and a half\ndozen of his colleagues have come in and were leading an expedition on\nTimbuktu. But Timbuktu had already joined up too, before they got\nthere--\"\n\n\"Wow,\" Homer said. \"It's really spreading.\"\n\nCliff said, \"Why isn't all this on the radio?\"\n\nIsobel had brought Kenny a couple of ounces of cognac from their\nmeager supply. He knocked it back thankfully.\n\nKenny said to Cliff, \"Things are moving too fast, and communications\nhave gone to pot.\" He looked at Homer. \"Have any of these journalists\nfound you yet?\"\n\n\"What journalists?\"\n\nKenny laughed. \"You'll find out. Half the newspapers, magazines,\nnewsreels and TV outfits in the world are sending every man they can\nrelease into this area. They're going batty trying to find El Hassan.\nMan, do you realize the extent of the country your followers now\ndominate?\"\n\nHomer said blankly, \"I hadn't thought of it. Besides, most of what\nyou've been saying is news to us here. We've been keeping on the\nprod.\"\n\nKenny grinned widely. \"Well, the nearest I can figure it, El Hassan is\nruler of an area about the size of Mexico. At least it was yesterday.\nBy today, you can probably tack on Texas.\"\n\nJimmy Peters, serious faced as usual, said, \"Things are moving so\nfast, we're going to have to run to keep ahead of El Hassan's\nfollowers. One thing, Homer, we're going to have to have a press\nsecretary.\"\n\n\"Elmer Allen was going to handle that, but he's still up north,\"\nIsobel said.\n\n\"I'll do it. Used to be a newspaperman, when I was younger,\" Dave\nMoroka said quickly.\n\nIsobel frowned and began to say something, but Homer said, \"Great, you\nhandle that, Dave.\" Then to Kenny, \"Where're your men and how well are\nthey armed?\"\n\n\"Well, that's one trouble,\" Kenny said unhappily. \"We requisitioned\nmotor transport from some of the Sahara Afforestation Project oases\ndown around Tessalit. In fact, Ralph Sandell, their chief mucky-muck\nin those parts, has come over to us. But we haven't got much in the\nway of shooting irons.\"\n\nHomer Crawford closed his eyes wearily. \"What it boils down to, still,\nis that a hundred of those Arab Legionnaires, with their armor, could\nfinish us all off in ten minutes if it came to open battle.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEl Hassan continued moving his headquarters, usually daily, but he\neluded the journalists only another twelve hours. Then they were upon\nthe mobile camp like locusts.\n\nAnd David Moroka took over with a calm efficiency that impressed all.\nIn the first place, he explained, El Hassan was much too busy to\nhandle the press except for one conference a week. In the second\nplace, he spoke only Esperanto to foreigners. Meanwhile, he, Dave\nMoroka, would handle all their questions, make arrangements for\nsuitable photographs, and for the TV and newsreel boys to trundle\ntheir equipment as near the front lines as possible. And, meanwhile,\nJames and John Peters of El Hassan's staff had prepared press releases\ncovering the El Hassan movement and its program.\n\nHomer, to the extent possible, was isolated from the new elements\ndescending upon his encampment. Attempting anything else would have\nbeen out of the question. At this point, he was getting approximately\nfour hours of sleep a night.\n\nKenny Ballalou was continually coming and going in a mad attempt to\nhandle the logistics of supplying several thousand men in a desert\narea all but devoid of either water or graze, not to speak of food,\npetroleum products and ammunition.\n\nIsobel and Cliff were thrown into the positions of combination\nsecretaries, ministers of finance, assistant bodyguards, and all else\nthat nobody else seemed to handle, _including_ making coffee.\n\nIt was Isobel who approached a subject which had long worried her, as\nthey drove across country, the only occupants of one of the original\nhover-lorries, during a camp move.\n\nShe said, hesitantly, \"Homer, is it a good idea to give Dave such a\nfree hand with the press? You know, there are some fifty or so of them\naround now and they must be influencing the TV, radio, magazines and\nnewspapers of the world.\"\n\n\"He seems to know more about it than any of the rest of us,\" Homer\nsaid, his eyes on the all but sand-obliterated way. \"We're going to\nhave to move more of the men south. We simply haven't got water enough\nfor them. There'd be enough in Tamanrasset, but not out here. Make a\nnote to cover this with Kenny. I wonder where Bey is, and Elmer.\"\n\nIsobel made a note. She said, \"Yes, but the trouble is, he's a\ncomparative newcomer. Are you _sure_ he's in complete accord with the\noriginal plan, Homer? Does the El Hassan dream mean the same to him as\nit does to you, and ... well, me?\"\n\nHe shot her an impatient glance, even as he hit the lift lever to\nraise them over a small dune. \"You and Dave don't hit it off very\nwell. He's a good man, so far as I can see.\"\n\nHer delicate forehead wrinkled and her pixie face showed puzzlement.\n\"I don't know why. I get along with most people, Homer.\"\n\nHe patted her hand. \"You can't please everybody, Isobel. Listen,\nsomething's got to be done about this king-size mob of camp followers\nwe've got. Did you know Common Europe sent in a delegation this\nmorning?\"\n\n\"Delegation? Common Europe--?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Haven't had time to discuss it with you. They found us just\nbefore we raised camp. Evidently, the British Commonwealth and\npossibly the Soviet Complex--some Chinese, I think--are also trying to\nlocate us. Half of these people are without their own equipment and\nsupplies, but that's not what worries me right now. We used to be able\nto camouflage our headquarters camp. Dig into the desert and avoid the\naircraft. But if a group of bungling Common Market diplomats can\nlocate us, what's to keep the Arab Legion from doing it and blessing\nus with a stick of neopalm bombs?\"\n\nIsobel said, \"Look, before we leave Dave. Did you know he was\nconfiscating all radio equipment brought into our camp by the newsmen\nand whoever else?\"\n\nHomer frowned. \"Well, why?\"\n\n\"Espionage, Dave says. He's afraid some of these characters might be\nin with the Arab Union and inform on us.\"\n\n\"Well, that makes some sense,\" Homer nodded.\n\n\"Does it?\" Isobel grumbled.\n\nHe shot an irritated glance at her again and said impatiently, \"Can't\nthe poor guy do anything right?\"\n\n\"My woman's intuition is working,\" Isobel grumbled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDave Moroka came into headquarters tent without introduction. He was\none of the half dozen who had permission for this. He had a sheaf of\npapers in his left hand and was frowning unhappily.\n\n\"What's the crisis?\" Homer said.\n\n\"Scouts coming up say your pal Bey-ag-Akhamouk is on the way.\nEvidently, with a big harka of Teda from the Sudan.\"\n\n\"Great.\" Homer crowed. \"Now we'll get going.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" Dave said. \"From what we hear, a good many are camel mounted.\nHow are we going to feed them? Already some of the Songhai Kenny\nbrought up from the south have drifted away, unhappy about supplies.\"\n\n\"Bey's a top man,\" Homer told him. \"The best. He'll have some ideas on\nour tactics. Meanwhile, we can turn over most of his men to one of the\nnew recruits, and head them down to take Fort Lamy. With Fort Lamy and\nLake Chad in our hands we'll control a chunk of Africa so big\neverybody else will start wondering why they shouldn't jump on the\nbandwagon while the going is good.\"\n\nDave said, \"Well, that brings up something else, Homer. These new\nrecruits. In the past couple of days, forty or fifty men who used to\nbe connected with African programs sponsored by everybody from the\nReunited Nations to this gobblydygook outfit Cliff and Isobel once\nworked for, the AFAA, have come over to El Hassan. The number will\nprobably double by tomorrow, and triple the next day.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Homer said. \"What's wrong with that? These are the people\nthat will really count in the long run.\"\n\n\"Nothing's wrong with it, within reason. But we're going to have to\nstart becoming selective, Homer. We've got to watch what jobs we let\nthese people have, how much responsibility we give them.\"\n\nHomer Crawford was frowning at him. \"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"See here,\" the wiry South African said plaintively, \"when El Hassan\nstarted off there were only a half dozen or so who had the dream, as\nyou call it. O.K. You could trust any one of them. Bey, Kenny, Elmer,\nCliff, this Jake Armstrong that you've sent to New York, Rex\nDonaldson, then Jimmy and Jack Peters and myself. We all came in when\nthe going was rough, if not impossible. But now things are different.\n_It looks as though El Hassan might actually win._\"\n\n\"So?\" Homer didn't get it.\n\n\"So from now on, you're going to have an infiltration of cloak and\ndagger lads from every outfit with an interest in North Africa.\nPotential traitors, potential assassins, subversives and what not.\"\n\nHomer was scowling at him. \"Confound it, what do you suggest? That\nthese Johnny-Come-Latelies be second-class citizens?\"\n\n\"Not exactly that, but this isn't funny. We've got to screen them. The\ntrouble with this movement is that it's a one-man deal, and has to be.\nThe average African is either a barbarian or an actual savage, one\nethnic degree lower. He wants a hero-symbol to follow. O.K., you're\nit. But remember both Moctezuma and Atahualpa. Their socio-economic\nsystems pyramided up to them. The Spanish conquistadores, being old\nhands at sophisticated European-type intrigue, quickly sized up the\nsituation. They kidnaped the hero-symbol, the big cheese, and later\nkilled him. And the Inca and the Aztec cultures collapsed.\"\n\nHomer was scowling at him unhappily.\n\nDave summed it up. \"All we need is one fuzzy minded commie from the\nSoviet Complex, or one super-dooper democrat who thinks that El Hassan\nstands in the way of _freedom_, whatever that is, and bingo a couple\nof bullets in your tummy and the El Hassan movement folds its tents\nlike the Arabs and takes a powder, as the old expression goes.\"\n\n\"You have your point,\" Homer Crawford admitted. \"Follow through, Dave.\nFigure out some screening program.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCliff came in. \"Hey, Homer. Guess what old Jake has done.\"\n\n\"Jake Armstrong?\"\n\n\"He's swung the Africa for Africans Association in New York over to\nus. They've raised a million bucks. What'll we do with it? How can he\nget anything to us?\"\n\n\"We'll have him plow it back into publicity and further fund raising\ncampaigns,\" Homer said. \"That's the way it's done. You raise some\nmoney for some cause and then spend it all on a bigger campaign to\nraise still more money, and what you get from that one you plow into a\nstill bigger campaign.\"\n\nCliff said, \"Don't you _ever_ get anything out of it?\"\n\nDave and Homer both laughed.\n\nCliff said, \"I've got some still better news.\"\n\n\"Good news, we can use,\" Homer said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe big Californian looked at him in pretended awe. \"A poet no less,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"Shut up,\" Homer said. \"What's the news?\"\n\nThe fact of the matter was, he was becoming increasingly impatient of\nthe continual banter expected of him by Cliff and even the others. As\noriginal members of the team, they expected an intimacy that he was\nfinding it increasingly difficult to deliver. Among other things, he\nwished that Cliff, in particular, would mind his attitude when such\nfollowers as Gu\u00c3\u00a9mama were present. The El Hassan posture could be\nmaintained only in never to be compromised dignity.\n\nBey had once compared him to Alexander, to Homer's amusement at the\ntime. But now he was beginning to sympathize with the position the\nMacedonian leader had found himself in, betwixt the King-God conscious\nPersians, and the rough and ready Companions who formed his bodyguard\nand crack cavalry units. A King-God simply didn't banter with his\nsubordinates, not even his blood-kin.\n\nCliff scowled at him now, at the sharpness of Homer's words, but he\nmade his report.\n\n\"Our old pal, Sven Zetterberg. He's gone out on a limb. Because of the\ngreat danger of this so-far localized fight spreading into world-wide\nconflict--says old Sven--the Reunited Nations will not tolerate the\ncombat going into the air. He says that if _either_ El Hassan or the\nArab Legion resort to use of aircraft, the Reunited Nations will send\nin its air fleet.\"\n\n\"Wow,\" Homer said. \"All the aircraft we've got are a few slow-moving\nheliocopters that Kenny brought up with him.\"\n\nDave Moroka snapped his fingers in a gesture of elation. \"That means\nZetterberg is throwing his weight to our side.\"\n\nHomer was on his feet. \"Send for Kenny and Gu\u00c3\u00a9mama and send a\nheliocopter down to pick up Bey and rush him here. He shouldn't be\nmore than a day's march away. I wonder what Elmer is up to. No word at\nall from him. At any rate, we want an immediate council of war. With\nArab Legion air cover eliminated, we can move in.\"\n\nCliff said sourly, \"It's still largely rifles against armored cars,\ntanks, mobile artillery and even flame throwers.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll the old hands were present. They stood about a map table, Homer\nand Bey-ag-Akhamouk at one end, the rest clustered about. Isobel sat\nin a chair to the rear, stenographer's pad on her knees.\n\nBey was clipping out suggestions.\n\n\"We have them now. Already our better trained men are heading up for\nTemassinine to the north and Fort Charlet to the east. We'll lose men\nbut we'll knock out every water hole between here and Libya. We'll cut\nevery road, blow what few bridges there are.\"\n\nJack Peters said worriedly, \"But the important thing is Tamanrasset.\nWhat good--\"\n\n\"We're cutting their supply line,\" Bey told him. \"Can't you see?\nColonel Ibrahim and his motorized column will be isolated in\nTamanrasset. They won't be able to get supplies through without an air\nlift and Sven Zetterberg's ultimatum kills that possibility. They're\nblocked off.\"\n\nJimmy Peters was as confused as his brother. \"So what? to use the\nAmericanism. They have both food and water in abundance. They can hold\nout indefinitely. Meanwhile, our forces are undisciplined irregulars.\nWe gain a thousand recruits a day. They come galloping in on\ncamel-back or in beat-up old vehicles, firing their hunting rifles\ninto the air. But we also lose a thousand a day. They get bored, or\nhungry, and decide to go back to their flocks, or their jobs on the\nnew Sahara projects. At any rate, they drift off again. It looks to me\nthat, if Colonel Ibrahim can hold out another week or so, our forces\nmight melt away--all except the couple of hundred or so European and\nAmerican educated followers. And, cut down to that number, they'll\neliminate us in no time flat.\"\n\nHomer Crawford was eying him in humor. \"You're no fighting man,\nPeters. Tell me, what is the single most fearsome enemy of an\nultra-mechanized soldier with the latest in military equipment and\nsuper-firepower weapons?\"\n\nJimmy Peters was blank. \"I suppose a similarly armed opponent.\"\n\nHomer smiled at him. \"Rather, a man with a knife.\"\n\nThe expressions of the Peters brothers showed resentment. \"We weren't\njesting.\"\n\n\"Neither was I,\" Homer rapped. He looked around at the rest, including\nBey and Kenny. \"What happens to a modern mechanized army when it runs\nout of gasoline? What happens to a water-cooled machine gun when there\nis no water? What use is a howitzer when the target is a single man in\nten acres of cover? Gentlemen, have any of you ever studied the\ntactics of Abd-el-Krim or, more recently still, Tito? Bey, I assume\nyou have.\"\n\nHe had their attention.\n\n\"During the Second War,\" Homer continued, \"this Yugoslavian Tito tied\nup two Nazi army corps with a handful of partisans--guerrillas. The\nmost modern army in the world, the German Panzers, tried to ferret him\nout for five years, and couldn't. There are other examples. The\nChinese operating against the Japs in the same war. Or one of the\nclassic examples is Abd-el-Krim destroying two different Spanish\narmies in the Moroccan Rif in the 1920s. His barefoot men, armed with\nrifles, took on Primo de Rivera's modernized Spanish armies and\ntrounced them.\"\n\nBey said, \"Homer's right. Our only tactics are guerrilla ones.\"\n\nHomer Crawford looked at Gu\u00c3\u00a9mama, who had been standing in the\nbackground, unfamiliar with the language these others spoke, but\nholding his dignity. Crawford said, diplomatically, \"And what sayest\nthou, O chieftain of the Tuareg?\"\n\nGu\u00c3\u00a9mama was gratified at the attention. He said in Tamaheq, \"As all\nmen know, O El Hassan, we now outnumber by thrice the Arab _giaours_\nmay they burn in Gehennum. Therefore, let us rush in and kill them\nall.\"\n\nBey shuddered.\n\nHomer Crawford nodded seriously. \"Ai, Gu\u00c3\u00a9mama, that would be the\nvalorous way of the Tuareg. But the heart of El Hassan forbids him to\nsacrifice the lives of his people. Consequently, we shall use the\ntactics of the desert jackal. Instruct those of your people who are\nmost cunning, to infiltrate Tamanrasset in the night. Let them not\ncarry arms for they may well be searched by the Arab _meleccha_.\"\n\nThe Tuareg chieftain was intrigued. \"And what shall they do in\nTamanrasset, El Hassan? Suddenly seize arms, one night, and rise up in\nwrath against the Arab dogs and kill them all?\"\n\nHomer was shaking his head. \"They will address themselves to the\nHaratin serfs and spread to them the message of El Hassan. They will\nbe told that in the world of El Hassan each man shall be free to seek\nhis own destiny to the extent his mind and abilities allow. And no man\nshall be the less because he was born a serf, and no man the more\nbecause he was born to wealth or power in the old days.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Aiii,\" Gu\u00c3\u00a9mama all but moaned. \"But such a message--\"\n\n\"Is the message of El Hassan, as all men know,\" Homer Crawford said\nflatly. He turned to Kenny Ballalou. \"Kenny, take over this angle. We\nwant as many propagandists in that town as possible. It's already\nchoked with refugees, most of them not knowing what they're fleeing.\nWe might get recruits there, too. But mostly we want to appeal to the\nsedentary natives in town. They've got to get the dreams, too. Promise\nthem schools, land ... I don't have to tell you.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Kenny said.\n\nIsobel said, \"Maybe I ought to get in on this, too. The women might do\na better job than men on this slant. It's going to take a lot to get a\nTuareg bedouin to sink to talking to a Haratin on an equal basis.\"\n\nBey and Homer had bent back over the maps, but before they could get\nback into the details of guerrilla warfare against Colonel Ibrahim and\nhis legionnaires, they were halted by a controversy from without.\n\n\"What now?\" Homer growled. \"This camp is getting to be like a\nthree-ring circus.\"\n\nThe entrance flap was pushed aside and three of Bey's Sudanese\ntribesmen half escorted, half pushed a newcomer front and center.\n\nIt was Fredric Ostrander, natty as usual, but now in khaki desert\nwear. He was obviously in a rage at the three rifle-carrying nomads\nwho had him in charge.\n\nBey spoke to the Teda warriors in their own tongue. Then to Homer in\nTamaheq, which he assumed the C.I.A. man didn't know, \"They picked him\nup in the desert in a hover-jeep. He was evidently looking for our\ncamp.\" He dismissed the three bedouin with a gesture.\n\nOstrander was outraged. He snapped at Homer Crawford, \"I demand an\nexplanation of this cavalier attack upon--\"\n\nHis face expressionless, Homer held up a hand to quiet the smaller\nman. He looked at Jack Peters and raised his eyebrows. \"_Kion li la\nfremdul diras?_\"\n\nJack, serious as ever, replied in Esperanto, then turned to the\nAmerican C.I.A. man and said, \"El Hassan has requested that I\ntranslate for him. He speaks only the official language of North\nAfrica to foreign representatives. Undoubtedly, sir, you have proper\ncredentials?\"\n\nHad Fredric Ostrander been of lighter complexion, his color would have\nundoubtedly gone dark red.\n\n\"Look here, Crawford,\" he snapped. \"I'm in no mood for nonsense. The\nState Department has sent me to your headquarters to make another\nattempt to bring some sense home to you. As an American citizen,\nowing alliance--\"\n\nHomer Crawford spoke in Esperanto to Jack Peters who nodded seriously\nand said to Ostrander, \"El Hassan informs you he owes alliance only to\nthe people of North Africa whose chosen leader he is.\"\n\nOstrander knew they were kidding him, but at the same time the stand\nbeing taken was actuality. He glared at the Americans present whom he\nknew, Bey, Isobel, Cliff and Kenny. He snapped, \"Very well, but I\nrepeat what I told you when last we met. The State Department of the\nUnited States of the Americas will not stand idly by and see this area\ntaken over by elements dominated by red subversives.\"\n\n\"Holy Mackerel,\" Cliff growled, \"are you still tooting that horn?\"\n\nDave Moroka said sarcastically, \"It's an old wheeze. The definition of\na red subversive is anybody who doesn't see eye to eye with the United\nStates. They've been pulling the gag for decades. Remember Guatemala\nand Cuba? Do anything that interferes with American business abroad\nand the cry goes up, _he's an enemy of the free world!_\"\n\nOstrander spun on him, his eyes narrowing.\n\nDave laughed. \"The definition of members of the free world, of course,\nbeing anybody who follows the American line. Anybody is free, Spanish\nand Portuguese dictators, absolute monarchs in Arabia, Chinese\nwarlords, if they're on the American side.\"\n\nOstrander snapped, \"I don't believe we've met.\"\n\nMoroka made a sweeping bow. \"I'm afraid we don't move in the same\ncircles. I've spent possibly a third of my life in prison--\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" Ostrander snorted.\n\n\"... Put there by people such as yourself--in various\ncountries--because I was fighting for my own version of freedom.\"\n\n\"Communism, undoubtedly!\"\n\nMoroka said softly, \"I'm a South African, sir. Both my parents were\nkilled in the 1960 riots. It seems that they had dark skins--even as\nyou and I--and weren't able to see why that should keep them from\n_freedom_.\"\n\nFredric Ostrander spun back to Homer Crawford. \"I'm not here to\nquibble with self-confessed malcontents. I've been sent to represent\nthe State Department, to report to them, and, above all, to do what I\ncan to prevent your activities from redounding to the further\nadvantage of the Soviet Complex. I assume you can assign me quarters.\"\n\nStraight-faced, Jack Peters translated this into Esperanto, and,\nstraight-faced, Homer answered in the same language.\n\nJack turned back to the impatient C.I.A. man. \"El Hassan welcomes the\nrepresentative of the United States of the Americas and hopes this\nwill be the first step toward diplomatic recognition between North\nAfrica and your great country. He has instructed me to find you\nquarters, which, possibly you may have to share with delegations from\nCommon Europe or\"--Peters cleared his throat--\"the Soviet Complex. He\nfurther suggests that it might be well, if you maintain communications\nwith your superiors, to have sent to you books on Esperanto, the\nofficial language of North Africa.\"\n\nDave Moroka put in, \"By the way, we'll have to go through your things.\nWe can't allow any radio communication from El Hassan's camp, except\nthrough official El Hassan channels--for obvious military reasons.\"\n\nOstrander snorted, stared indignantly at Homer again, spun on his heel\nand stalked from the tent. Jack Peters followed him but not before\ntipping an uncharacteristic wink at Homer.\n\nWhen they were gone, Homer sighed and looked at Dave Moroka. \"That\nreminds me, how are our other delegations coming?\"\n\nThe South African grinned ruefully. \"They're playing it cool. Waiting\nto see what way to jump. Give El Hassan some real success, and they'll\nprobably jump at the chance to be first to recognize him. Especially\nthese Soviet Complex opportunists. They'd just love to suck you into\ntheir camp.\"\n\nIsobel looked at him. \"After that tearing down you gave poor Ostrander\nabout the United States, now you rip into the Soviet Complex. Just\nwhere do you stand, Dave?\"\n\nDave shrugged her question off, as though there were more important\nthings. \"I'm an El Hassan man,\" he said. \"Let those two overgrown\npowers handle their own troubles.\"\n\nJimmy Peters spoke up for the first time since Ostrander entered the\ntent. \"You know,\" he said, seriously, \"I'm beginning to wonder if the\nworld can afford nationalistic patriotism. Haven't we gone too far\nalong the road to think of ourselves any longer as Americans, or\nRussians, or French, or West Indians, or whatever? Hasn't the human\nrace grown up beyond that point?\"\n\nKenny said mockingly, \"What! Aren't you proud of being a West Indian,\nand a loyal subject of Her Majesty?\"\n\nPeters ignored his tone. \"Why should I be proud of my country? It was\nan accident of birth with which I had nothing to do, that made me a\nWest Indian, rather than a Canadian, a Chinese, a Norwegian, or\nwhatever. Intelligently, I should be proud only of things that I,\nmyself, have accomplished.\"\n\nBey said, \"If we can stop waxing philosophic for a while and get back\nto how most efficiently to clobber these Arabs--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Hindu entered Kirill Menzhinsky's small office behind the Indian\nsouvenir shop in the Tangier Zocco Chico and said, \"The operative\nAnton is on the receiver.\"\n\nThe agent superior of the _Chrezvychainaya Komissiya_ for North Africa\nlooked up from his desk and grunted acceptance of the message. He came\nto his feet and followed the other into a back room and took his place\nbefore a mouthpiece and screen.\n\nThe man whose party name was Anton nodded a greeting.\n\nKirill Menzhinsky said, \"It's about time I heard from you, Anton.\"\n\n\"Yes. But the situation has been such that it was not easy to report.\"\n\n\"And now?\"\n\n\"Briefly, I am at El Hassan's headquarters. You were correct. He is in\nactuality Homer Crawford. The others you mentioned are also with him,\nincluding the traitor Isobel Cunningham.\"\n\nThe Soviet Complex's agent allowed his eyebrows to rise.\n\nAnton said flatly, \"The dame has evidently renounced the party and now\nholds high rank in Crawford's inner circle.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"I am rapidly becoming his right-hand man. I am his press secretary\nand in charge of communications. Early in our acquaintanceship I was\nable to engineer an attempted assassination. I was able to, ah, save\nthe life of El Hassan.\"\n\nThe Russian's eyes narrowed. \"The assassins? Is there any chance that\nthey might reveal your little trick?\"\n\nAnton grimaced. \"I am not a fool, Kirill. Both of them were killed in\nthe assassination attempt. El Hassan was most grateful.\"\n\n\"I see. And how would you sum up the present situation?\"\n\n\"This area is swinging rapidly to El Hassan, but any sort of defeat\nand undoubtedly his followers would melt away. The bedouin are too\nvolatile. Before he ever makes any real headway he will have to take\nthe major commercial and industrial cities such as Dakar, Kano,\nLagos, Accra, Freetown, Khartoum, and eventually, of course, Cairo,\nCasablanca, Algiers and so forth.\"\n\n\"And our friend El Hassan leans not at all in our direction?\"\n\nThe man the Party called Anton shook his head. \"He leans in no\ndirection, except that which will unite and modernize North Africa.\nNeither do his immediate followers. They're a well-knit group and it\nseems unlikely that I could pry any of them away from him in case it\nbecame desirable.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Kirill Menzhinsky muttered. \"I understand that a delegation\nfrom Moscow has arrived in El Hassan's camp. Have you contacted them?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. My orders were to rise in the El Hassan hierarchy and\nawait further orders. None of my current, ah, colleagues have any\nsuggestion that I am identified with the Party. Which reminds me, an\nAmerican C.I.A. man, Fredric Ostrander, has shown up. The fool seems\nto be under the impression that El Hassan is a Party tool.\"\n\n\"I know this Ostrander. Don't underestimate him, Anton. He's an\nextremely competent operative in the clutch, as the Americans call\nit.\"\n\n\"Perhaps. But nevertheless, there is no indication that the El Hassan\nmovement leans either to East or West, nor do I see any signs that it\nis apt to in the future.\"\n\nThe Russian was scowling. \"I see. Then perhaps it will be necessary\nfor us to do something to topple our El Hassan before he becomes much\nstronger, and to find another to unite North Africa.\"\n\nAnton frowned in his turn. \"I don't know. This man Crawford--and his\nfollowers, for that matter--are motivated by high ideals. As you have\nsaid, North Africa is not ready for our socio-economic system. Men of\nthe caliber of Homer Crawford could bring it into the modern age\nperhaps more quickly than another.\"\n\nMenzhinsky chuckled. \"Don't worry about it, Anton. Such matters of\npolicy will be decided by others than you, or even me. Keep in touch\nwith me more often, in the future, Anton.\"\n\n\"Yes, Comrade.\" His face faded from the screen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTamanrasset lies at an altitude of approximately 4,600 feet, about\naverage for the Ahaggar plateau. Around it, such peaks as the Tahat\nreach 9,600 feet above sea level. The country is rugged, jagged, bleak\nbeyond belief. With the possible exception of Southern Afghanistan in\nthe Khyber area, there is no place in the world more suited for\nguerrilla warfare, less suited for the proper utilization of modern\narmor, particularly when the latter is forced to work without air\ncover.\n\nHomer Crawford, equipped with an old-style telescope, was\nspread-eagled on top a rock outcropping, his only companion Isobel\nCunningham. Directly before him, possibly two miles in distance, was\nthe desert city of Tamanrasset, to the right, a kilometer or so, Amsel\nwhere palatable water was to be found at eighteen meters depth.\n\n\"Our friend, the colonel, is up to something,\" he grumbled.\n\nShe had a pair of binoculars, of considerably less power than his\nglass.\n\n\"It looks as though Gu\u00c3\u00a9mama's boys are on the run,\" she said.\n\n\"As per orders. The primary theory of partisan warfare is not to get\nkilled. The guerrilla never stands and fights. If the regular forces\nhe opposes can bring him to bay, they've got him.\" He interrupted\nhimself to clip out, \"Look at that tank, darling! There on the left!\"\n\nIsobel tightened, looked at him quickly from the side of her eyes. No.\nHe'd said it inadvertently, his mind concentrated on the fighting men\nbelow. She had often wondered where she stood with Homer Crawford the\nman, as opposed to El Hassan the idealist. The tip of her tongue\nlicked the side of her mouth, as she surreptitiously took him in. But\nCrawford the man would have to wait, there was no time, no time.\n\nIsobel swung her glasses. \"The one starting to go in a circle? There,\nit stopped.\"\n\n\"One of the snipers got its commander,\" Homer said. \"You can't fight a\ntank without the commander's head being up through the hatch. That's a\npopular fallacy. You can't see well enough to fight your tank unless\nyou've got your head up. And that's suicide when you're against\nguerrillas. The colonel ought to send his infantry out first.\"\n\nIsobel said, \"What did you mean when you said that he's up to\nsomething?\"\n\nHomer's eye was still glued to the eyepiece of his glass. \"He's leaving\nhis entrenchments and sending his vehicles out to capture our ... our\nstrong points.\"\n\n\"You mean our water, don't you?\"\n\nBey came snaking up to them on his belly. He came abreast of Homer and\nbrought forth his own binoculars. He watched for a moment and then\nmuttered a curse under his breath.\n\n\"Gu\u00c3\u00a9mama better start pulling back those men more quickly,\" he said.\n\n\"He will. He's a good man,\" Homer told him. \"What's up?\"\n\n\"Evidently, Colonel Ibrahim has decided to come out of retirement.\nHe's sent small motorized elements to Effok, In Fedjeg, Otoul and even\nto Tahifet.\"\n\n\"And--?\"\n\n\"And has taken them all, of course. Our men fall back, fighting a\nstubborn rear-guard action, taking as few casualties as possible.\"\n\n\"I don't get it,\" Homer bit out. \"He's using up his fuel and\nammunition and losing more men than we are. Certainly he can't figure,\nwith the thousand odd troops he has, to be able to take and hold\nenough of the oases and water holes in this vicinity to push us out\ncompletely.\"\n\nBey said, \"What worries me is the possibility that he knows something\nwe don't. That he's figuring on being relieved or has a new source of\nfuel, ammunition and men on tap.\"\n\n\"The roads are cut. Our men hold every source of water from here to\nLibya and the Reunited Nations has put thumbs down on aircraft which\neliminates an air lift.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Bey said, unhappily.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat evening, following the day's last meal, Cliff came into the\nheadquarters tent grinning, broadly. \"Hey, guess what we've\nliberated.\"\n\n\"A bottle of Scotch?\" Kenny said hopefully.\n\n\"A king-size portable radio transmitter. Ralph Sandell knew about it.\nThe Sahara Afforestation Project people were going to use it to\npropagandize the tribesmen into coming in and taking jobs in the new\noases.\"\n\nDave Moroka, who'd been censoring press releases, shook his head.\n\"That's why we need an El Hassan in this country,\" he complained.\n\"They put a couple of million dollars into a radio transmitter, never\nasking themselves how many of the bedouin own radios.\"\n\nJack Peters said, \"Wait a moment, you chaps. Didn't Bey capture a\ncouple of Arab Legion radio technicians today?\"\n\n\"They defected to us,\" Homer Crawford said, looking up from an\nimprovised desk where he was poring over some supply papers with\nIsobel. \"What did you have in mind, Jack?\"\n\n\"There are radios in Tamanrasset. In fact, there's probably a radio in\nevery one of those military vehicles of Ibrahim's. Why can't we\nblanket these Arab Union chaps with El Hassan propaganda? Quite a few\nof them are from Libya, Tunisia and Egypt. In short, they're Africans\nand susceptible to El Hassan's dream.\"\n\n\"Good man. Take over the details, Jack,\" Homer said. He went back to\nhis work with Isobel.\n\nJimmy Peters entered with some papers in hand. He said, seriously,\n\"The temperature is rising in the Reunited Nations--and everywhere\nelse, for that matter. Damascus and Cairo have been getting\nincreasingly belligerent. Homer, it looks as though the Arab Union is\ngetting ready to go out on a limb. Weeks have passed since Colonel\nIbrahim first took Tamanrasset and the Reunited Nations, the United\nStates, the Soviet Complex and all others interested in North Africa,\nhave failed to do anything. Everybody, evidently, afraid of\nprecipitating something that couldn't be ended.\"\n\nAll eyes went to Homer Crawford who ran a black hand back over his\nhair in weariness. \"I know,\" he said. \"Something is about to blow.\nDave has sent some of his best men into Tamanrasset to pick up gossip\nin the souks. Morale was dragging bottom among the legionnaires just a\ncouple of days ago. Now they seem to have a new lease.\"\n\n\"In spite of the sabotage our people have been committing?\" Isobel\nsaid.\n\n\"That's falling off somewhat,\" Cliff said. \"At first our more\nenthusiastic followers were able to pull everything from heaving\nMolotov Cocktails into tanks, to pouring sugar in hover-jeep gas\ntanks, but the legionnaires have both smartened up and gotten very\ntough.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Dave Moroka said now.\n\nThey looked at him.\n\n\"Atrocities,\" he said. \"In order to guard against sabotage, the\nlegionnaires will be taking measures that will antagonize the people\nin Tamanrasset. They'll shoot a couple of teenage kids, or something,\nthen they'll have a city-wide mess on their hands.\"\n\nIsobel said unhappily, \"It seems a nasty way to win a war.\"\n\nDave grunted his contempt of her opinion. \"There is no way of winning\na war other than a nasty one.\"\n\nBey came in, yawning hugely. His energy was inconceivable to the\nothers. So far as was known, he hadn't slept, other than sitting erect\nin a moving vehicle, for the past four days. He said to Homer, \"Fred\nOstrander has been bending my ear for the past hour or so. Do you want\nto talk to him?\"\n\n\"About what?\" Homer said.\n\n\"I don't know. He has a lot of questions. I think he's beginning to\nsuspect--just _suspect_, understand--that possibly the whole bunch of\nus aren't receiving our daily instructions from either Moscow or\nPeking.\"\n\nDave and Cliff both laughed.\n\nHomer sighed and said, \"Show him in. He's the only thing we have in\nthe way of a contact with the United States of the Americas and sooner\nor later we're going to have to make our peace with both them and the\nSoviet Complex. In fact, what we're probably going to have to do is\nplay one against the other, getting grants, loans, economic\nassistance--\"\n\n\"Technicians, teachers, arms,\" Bey continued the list.\n\nKenny Ballalou looked at him and snorted. \"Arms! If there's anything\nthis part of the world doesn't need it's more arms. In fact, that goes\nfor the rest of the world, too. In the old days when the great nations\nwere first beginning to attempt to line up the neutrals they sent aid\nto such countries by the billions--and most of it in arms. How\nridiculous can you get? Putting arms in the hands of most of the\ngovernments of that time was like handing a loaded pistol to an\nidiot.\"\n\nBey hung his head in mock humility. \"I bow before your wisdom,\" he\nsaid. He left the room to get Ostrander.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe C.I.A. man had lost a fraction of his belligerence, but none of\nhis arrogance and natty appearance. Homer wondered vaguely how the\nother managed to remain so spruce in the inadequate desert camp.\n\nJack Peters said, \"What did you wish to ask El Hassan? I will\ntranslate.\"\n\n\"Never mind that, Jack,\" Homer said. \"We'll get tougher about using\nour official language when we've gone a little further in building\nour new government.\" He said to Ostrander, \"What can I do for you?\nObviously, my time, is limited.\"\n\nFredric Ostrander said, \"I've been gathering material for reports to\nmy superiors. I've been doing a good deal of questioning, and,\nfrankly, even prying around.\"\n\nCliff grunted.\n\nOstrander went on. \"I've also read the various press releases,\nmanifestoes and so forth that your assistants have been compiling.\"\n\n\"We know,\" Homer said. \"We haven't put any obstacles in your way. We\nhaven't any particular secrets, Mr. Ostrander.\"\n\n\"You disguise the fact that you are an American,\" the C.I.A. man said\naccusingly.\n\nHomer said slowly, \"Only because El Hassan _is not_ an American, Mr.\nOstrander. He is an African with African solutions to African\nproblems. That is what he must be if he is to accomplish his task.\"\n\nOstrander seemed to switch subjects. \"See here, Crawford, the State\nDepartment is not completely opposed to the goal of uniting North\nAfrica. It would solve many problems, both African and international.\"\n\nKenny Ballalou laughed softly. \"You mean, you're on our side?\"\n\nOstrander turned to him, for once not incensed at being needled.\n\"Possibly more than you'd think,\" he rapped. He turned back again to\nHomer Crawford. \"The question becomes, why do you think that _you_ are\nthe man for the job? Who gave _you_ the go-ahead?\"\n\nBey, who had settled down into a folding camp chair, now came to his\nfeet, his tired face angry.\n\nBut Homer waved him to silence. \"Hold it,\" he said. Then to Ostrander.\n\"It doesn't work that way. It's not something you decide to do because\nyou're thirsty for power, or greedy for money. You're pushed into it.\nDo you think Washington, a retired Virginian planter wrapped up in his\nestate and his family, wanted to spend years leading the revolutionary\narmies through the wilderness that was America in those days? He was\nthrust into the job, there was no one else more competent to take it.\nMen make the times, Ostrander, but the times also make the men. Look\nat Lenin and Trotsky. Three months before the October Revolution,\nLenin wrote that he never expected to see in his lifetime the\nBolsheviks come to power. Within those months he was at the head of\ngovernment and Trotsky, a former bookworm who had never fired a gun in\nhis life, was head of the Red Army and being proclaimed a military\ngenius.\"\n\nOstrander was scowling at him, but his face was thoughtful.\n\nHomer said quietly, \"It's not always an easy thing, to have power thrust\ninto your hands. Not always a desirable thing.\" His voice went quieter\nstill. \"Only a short time ago it led me to the necessity of ...\nkilling ... my best friend.\"\n\n\"And mine,\" Isobel said softly, almost under her breath.\n\nDave Moroka said, \"Abe Baker,\" before he caught himself.\n\nKenny Ballalou looked at him strangely. \"Did you know Abe?\"\n\nThe South African recovered. \"I've heard several of you mention him\nfrom time to time. He was a commie, wasn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Homer said without inflection. \"And a man. He saved my life on\nmore than one occasion. As long as we worked together with only Africa\nin mind, there was no conflict. But Abe had a further, and, to him,\ngreater alliance.\"\n\nHe turned his attention back to the C.I.A. man. \"A man does what he\nmust do,\" he finished simply. \"I did not ask to become El Hassan.\"\n\nOstrander said, \"Your motivation is possibly beside the point. The\nthing is that the battle for men's minds continues and your program,\neventually, must align with the West.\"\n\n\"And get clobbered in the stampeding around between the two great\npowers,\" Kenny said dryly.\n\n\"You've got to take your stand,\" Ostrander said. \"I'd rather die under\nthe neutron bomb, than spend the rest of my life on my knees under a\nSoviet Complex government. Wouldn't you?\" His eyes went from one of\nthem to the other, defiantly.\n\nHomer said slowly. \"No, even though that was the only alternative,\nwhich is unlikely. Not if it meant finishing off the whole human race\nat the same time.\" He shook his head. \"If it were only me, it might be\ndifferent. But if it was a matter of nuclear war the whole race might\nwell end. Given such circumstances, I'd be proud to remain on my\nknees the rest of my life. You see, Ostrander, you make the mistake of\nthinking the Soviet socio-economic system is a permanent thing. It\nisn't. It's changing daily, even as our own socio-economic system is.\nEven if the Soviet Complex were to dominate the whole world, it would\nbe but a temporary phase in man's history. Their regime, in its time,\nright or wrong, will go under in man's march to whatever his destiny\nmight be. Some day it will be only a memory, and so will the\nsocio-economic systems of the West. No institutions are less permanent\nthan politico-economic ones.\"\n\n\"I don't agree with you,\" Ostrander snapped.\n\n\"Obviously,\" Homer shrugged. \"However, this is another problem. El\nHassan deals with North Africa. The other problems you bring up we\nadmit, but at this stage are not dealing with them. Our dream is in\nAfrica. Perhaps the Africans will be forced to taking other stands, to\ndreaming new dreams, twenty or thirty years from now. When that time\ncomes, I assume the new problems will be faced. By that time there\nwill probably be no need for El Hassan.\"\n\nOstrander looked at him and bit his lip in thought.\n\nIt came to him now that he had never won in his contests with Homer\nCrawford, and that he would probably never win. No matter how strong\nhis convictions, in the presence of the other man, something went out\nof him. There was strength in Crawford that must be experienced to be\nunderstood. When he talked, he held you, and your own opinions became\nnothing--stupidities on your lips. He had a dream, and in conversation\nwith him, all other things dropped away and nothing was of importance\nbut that dream. A dream? Possibly _disease_ was the better word. And\nso highly contagious.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWhile they talked, an aide had entered and handed a report to\nBey-ag-Akhamouk. He read it and closed his eyes in weariness.\n\n\"What's up, Bey,\" Homer asked.\n\n\"I don't know. Colonel Ibrahim has stepped up his attacks in all\ndirections. At least two thirds of his force is on the offensive. It\ndoesn't make much sense. But it must make sense to _him_, or he\nwouldn't be doing it.\"\n\nOstrander said, and to everyone's surprise there seemed to be an\nelement of worry in his voice too, \"I know Colonel Midan Ibrahim, met\nhim in Cairo and in Baghdad on various occasions. He's considered one\nof the best men in the Arab Legion. He doesn't make military\nblunders.\"\n\nBey said, \"Come on, Kenny. Let's round up Gu\u00c3\u00a9mama and take a look at\nthe front.\" He led the way from the tent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a guard posted before the tent which doubled as press and\ncommunications center, and the private quarters of David Moroka.\n\nThe figure that approached timidly was garbed in the traditional\nclothing of the young women of the T\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9h\u00c3\u00a9 Mellet tribe of the Tuareg\nand bore an _imzad_ in her left hand, while her right held a corner of\nher gandoura over her face.\n\nThe guard, of the Kel Rela tribe, eyed the one-stringed violin with\nits string of hair and sounding box made of half a gourd covered with\na thin membrane of skin, and grinned. A Tuareg maid was accustomed to\nsing and to make the high whining tones of desert music on the _imzad_\nbefore submitting to her lover's embrace. _Wallahi!_ but these women\nof the T\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9h\u00c3\u00a9 Mellet were shameless.\n\n\"Where do you go?\" he said gruffly. \"El Hassan's vizier has ordered\nthat he is occupied and none should approach.\"\n\n\"He awaits me,\" she wavered. There was _kohl_ about her eyes, and\nindigo at the corners of her mouth. \"We met at the _tendi_ last night\nand he bid me come to his tent. It is for me he waits.\"\n\n_Wallahi!_ but his leader had taste, the sentry decided.\n\n\"Pass,\" he said gruffly. Even a vizier of such importance as this one\nmust need solace at times, he decided philosophically.\n\nShe slipped past silently to the tent entrance where the Tuareg guard\nnoticed she paused for a long moment before entering. He grinned into\nhis teguelmoust. Aiii, the little bird was timid before the hawk.\n\nShe stood for a moment listening, and then slipped inside, dropping\nthe desert musical instrument to the ground. Dave Moroka's back was to\nher and even as she entered he flicked off the switch of the\nvideo-radio into which he had been speaking and scowled at it.\n\nWhen he stood and began to turn, she covered him with the small pocket\npistol. She had an ease in handling it which denoted competence.\n\nHis eyebrows went up, but he remained silent, waiting for her gambit.\n\nIsobel said evenly, \"You're a Party member, aren't you, Dave?\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?\"\n\nShe nodded infinitesimally to the set. \"You were reporting just now. I\nheard enough just as I came in.\"\n\nHe took in her disguise. \"My guard isn't as efficient as I had\nthought,\" Dave said wryly.\n\nIsobel said, \"You knew Abe Baker, didn't you?\"\n\nHe looked at her, expressionlessly.\n\nShe said, \"I already knew you belonged to the Party, Dave. No matter\nhow competent an agent, it's something difficult to hide from any\nother long-time member. There's a terminology you use--such as calling\nit the Soviet Union, rather than Russia. No commie ever says Russia,\nit's always _the Soviet Union_. You can tell, just as a Roman Catholic\ncan tell a person raised in the Church, even though the other has\ndropped away, or even as one Jew can tell another. Yes, I've known\nyou were a Party member for some time, Dave.\"\n\n\"And?\" the South African said.\n\n\"Why are you here?\"\n\nDave Moroka said, \"For the same reason you are, to further the El\nHassan dream, the uniting and modernization of the continent of my\nracial heritage.\"\n\n\"But you are still a Party member and still report to your superiors.\"\n\nDave Moroka looked at the tiny gun she held in her hand.\n\n\"Don't try it,\" she said. \"I have seen you in action, Dave. I have\nnever seen a man move so ruthlessly fast ... but don't try it.\"\n\n\"No reason to,\" he bit out. \"Come on, let's go see Homer.\"\n\nShe was slightly taken aback, but not enough to release her control\nfor even a split second. \"Lead the way,\" she said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEven at this time of evening, the headquarters tent was brightly lit\nand most of the immediate El Hassan staff still at work. Homer\nCrawford looked up as they entered.\n\nCliff Jackson saw the gun first and said, \"Holy Mackerel, Isobel.\"\n\nFredric Ostrander was sitting to one side in discussion with the sober\nfaced Jack Peters. He took in the gun and slowly came to his feet,\nobviously expecting climax.\n\nIsobel said, \"Dave's taking over control of communications had method.\nI just found him reporting to what must have been a superior ... in\nthe Party.\"\n\nHomer Crawford looked from the South African to Isobel, then back to\nDave again, without speaking. His eyes were questioning.\n\nDave said, his voice sharp. \"I haven't time for details now. Isobel's\nright. I was a Party member.\"\n\n\"Was?\" Ostrander chuckled. \"That's the understatement of the year. I\nhadn't got around to revealing the fact as yet, but our friend Dave is\nthe notorious Anton, one of the Soviet Complex's most competent\nhatchetmen.\"\n\nDave looked at him only briefly. \"Was,\" he reiterated. He turned his\nattention to Homer and to Bey, who was staring tired dismay at this\nnew addition to the load.\n\nHomer still held his peace, waiting for the other to go on.\n\n\"I found out tonight why Colonel Ibrahim is attacking, instead of\npulling in his horns as reason would dictate.\" Dave paused for\nemphasis. \"The Soviet Complex has thrown its weight, in this matter at\nleast, on the side of the Arab Union. They have insisted that Sven\nZetterberg be dismissed as head of the Sahara Division of the African\nDevelopment Project and that his threat to use Reunited Nations\naircraft if the local fighting spreads to the air, be repudiated.\"\n\nKenny blurted, \"Good grief ... that means--\"\n\nDave looked around at them, one by one. \"It means,\" he said, \"that the\nArab Legion is going to be reinforced tomorrow morning by a full\nregiment of paratroopers.\"\n\n\"Holy Mackerel,\" Cliff groaned. \"We've had it. Another regiment of\ncrack troops in Tamanrasset and we'll _never_ take the town.\"\n\nDave shook his head. \"That's not the big thing. The paratroopers\naren't going to drop in Tamanrasset. They're going to hit every oasis,\nevery water hole, in a circumference of two hundred miles.\"\n\nThere was an empty silence.\n\nHomer Crawford said finally, evenly, \"In the expectation that every\nfollower of El Hassan in the Sahara will either surrender or die of\nthirst, eh?\" He didn't seem sufficiently impressed by the threatening\ndisaster. He looked at Dave questioningly. \"Why do you bother to tell\nus, Dave, if you're on the other side?\"\n\nDave grunted sour amusement. \"Because I've just become a full member\nof the team. I resigned from the Party tonight.\"\n\n\"Brother,\" Bey said, \"you sure pick a helluva time to join up.\" He\nobviously was expressing the opinions of the majority.\n\nHomer Crawford came to his feet and looked around at them. \"All\nright,\" he said. \"A new complication. Let's face up to it. There's\nalways an answer. We're in the clutch, let's fight our way out.\"\n\nLargely, they stared at him, but he ignored their dismay. He looked\nfrom one to the other. \"We need some ideas. Let's kick it around.\nIsobel, Cliff, Jack, Kenny--?\" His eyes went from one to the other.\nObviously his own mind was churning.\n\nThey shook their heads dumbly.\n\nKenny said, \"Ideas! We've had it, Homer!\"\n\nHomer Crawford spun on him and now the force they all knew was\nemanating from him. He laughed his scorn. \"A month ago we were half a\ndozen fugitives. Now we're an army besieging a city. And you say we've\nhad it? Listen, Kenny, if we have to we'll go back to being half a\ndozen fugitives again--those of us that are left. But the dream goes\non! However, we're not going to have to. We're too near victory in\nthis stage of the operation to sit down on the job because of a\nthreatened reverse. Now then, let's kick it around. Jimmy! Dave!\nKenny! Ostrander!\"\n\nFredric Ostrander raised his eyebrows only slightly at being included\nin their number.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBey, for once, was seemingly too exhausted to be brought to new\nenthusiasm. He tossed a detail map of Tamanrasset to the table. \"And\nI'd just worked out a bang-up scheme for infiltrating into town,\njoining up with our adherents there, and seizing it while most of\nIbrahim's men were out in the desert, trying to capture our nearer\nwater holes.\"\n\nHomer snapped, \"It sounds like it still might have possibilities.\"\n\nOstrander looked down at the map, his face very tight. \"How long would\nit take?\"\n\nBey scowled at him, defeat dulling his mind. \"What?\"\n\n\"How long do you figure it would take to infiltrate Tamanrasset and\ncapture it? Behind Ibrahim's back, so to speak.\"\n\nBey grunted. \"A couple of hours in the early morning. I had a\nbeautiful picture of the colonel's armor out in the desert, cut off\nfrom its petroleum supplies and ammunition dump while we held the\ntown. Some of our men, the former veterans of the French West African\nforces, could have even operated the antitank guns he has mounted at\nFort Laperrine.\"\n\nThe C.I.A. man's mouth worked.\n\nHomer Crawford's eyes pierced him.\n\nOstrander walked over to the radio before which Kenny Ballalou sat.\n\"See if you can raise Colonel Ibrahim for me.\"\n\nKenny scowled at him. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Do it.\"\n\nKenny looked at Homer Crawford.\n\nHomer said, \"O.K. Do it.\"\n\nKenny shrugged and turned to the set. While the others watched,\nCrawford's face alert, his eyes narrowed, the rest of them dull in\napathy, the face of Colonel Ibrahim finally faded in on the screen.\n\nFredric Ostrander took his place at the instrument. He nodded,\nformally. \"Greetings, Colonel, it seems a long time since last we met\nin Amman.\"\n\nThe Arab Legion officer smiled politely. \"I had heard that you\nrepresented the State Department in this area, Mr. Ostrander, and have\nbeen somewhat surprised that you failed to make Tamanrasset your\nheadquarters. It would have been pleasant to have renewed old\nfriendship.\"\n\nOstrander cleared his throat. \"I am afraid that would have been\ndifficult, Colonel, particularly in view of the stand of my government\nat this time.\"\n\nOn the screen, the other's eyebrows went up.\n\nOstrander said evenly, \"Colonel, we have just been informed that a\nregiment of paratroopers has been put at your disposal and that they\nplan to land at various points in the Sahara in the morning.\"\n\nThe colonel said stiffly, \"This is military information which I am not\nfree to discuss, Mr. Ostrander.\"\n\nFrederic Ostrander went on, his voice still even. \"We have further\nbeen informed that the Reunited Nations has withdrawn its ban on\naircraft, which would seem to free your paratroop carrying planes.\"\n\nThe colonel remained silent, waiting for the bombshell. It was obvious\nthat he expected a bombshell.\n\nOstrander said, \"As representative of the State Department I warn you\nthat if these paratroop carrying planes take off tomorrow morning, the\nSeventh Airfleet of the United States of the Americas will enter the\nconflict on the side of El Hassan. Good evening, Colonel.\"\n\nThe C.I.A. man reached out and flicked the switch that killed the set.\nThen he took the snowy white handkerchief from the breast pocket of\nhis jacket and wiped his mouth.\n\nIsobel said, \"Heavens to Betsy.\"\n\nKenny said indignantly, \"Good grief, you fool, it won't take more than\nhours for your superiors to repudiate you. Then what happens?\"\n\n\"By then, I assume, the battle will be over and Tamanrasset in El\nHassan's hands. The Arab Union will then think twice before committing\ntheir paratroopers, particularly with captured armor in El Hassan's\nhands.\"\n\n\"And your name will be mud,\" Kenny blurted.\n\nOstrander looked at Homer Crawford. \"Gentlemen, you must remember that\nI, too, am an African. I had thought that perhaps there would be a\nposition for me on El Hassan's staff.\"\n\nCrawford reached for the Tommy-Noiseless that leaned up against the\nimprovised desk at which he worked. He said, \"Let's get moving, Bey.\nWe haven't much time. We're going to have to be able to announce its\ncapture _from_ Tamanrasset in a couple of hours.\"\n\n\"Not you,\" Bey said, grabbing up his own weapon and motioning with his\nhead for Kenny and Cliff to come along. \"You're El Hassan and can't be\nrisked.\"\n\n\"I'm coming,\" Homer said flatly. \"It's about time El Hassan began\ntaking some of the same risks his followers seem to be willing to\nface. Besides, the men will fight better with me out in front. Got a\ngun, Fred?\"\n\nOstrander said, \"No. Where am I issued one?\"\n\n\"I'll show you,\" Homer said, stuffing extra clips in his bush jacket\npockets. \"Come on, Dave.\"\n\nThe whole group began heading for the open air, Bey already yelling\norders.\n\nFredric Ostrander looked at Dave Moroka. \"Strange bedfellows,\" he\nsaid.\n\nMoroka grinned wryly. \"My long view hasn't changed,\" he said. \"It's\njust that this African matter takes precedence right now.\"\n\n\"Nor mine, of course,\" Ostrander said. He cleared his throat.\n\"However, I hope you last out the night. El Hassan needs strong men.\"\n\n\"Same to you,\" Moroka said gruffly. \"Let's get going, or the fight\nwill be over while we hand each other flowers.\"\n\n\n_Epilogue_\n\nEl Hassan stood in the smoking, war-wasted ruin of Fort Laperine, his\nmind empty. The body of Jack Peters was ten feet to his left, burned\nbeyond recognition and crumpled over a flame thrower which he'd\neliminated in the last few moments of the fighting. Had he let his\neyes go out the gun port before which he stood, it might have been\npossible for El Hassan to have picked out the bodies of David Moroka\nand Fredric Ostrander amidst those of the several hundred Haratin\nserfs who had swarmed out of the souk area at the crucial moment and\nstormed the half manned fort--unarmed save for knives and farm\nimplements.\n\nTo his right, Dr. Warren Harding Smythe supervised two Tuareg who were\ncarrying off the broken body of Kenny Ballalou; there was still faint\nlife in it.\n\nThe doctor looked at him. \"You are satisfied, I assume?\"\n\nEl Hassan failed to hear him.\n\nSmythe turned and stomped off, following his impressed nurses.\n\nIn the distance, Bey-ag-Akhamouk called hoarse orders from an\nover-strained throat, placing guns for a counterattack that would\nnever come. The Arab Legion was broken and Colonel Ibrahim a prisoner.\nLarge numbers of the survivors were defecting to the banner of El\nHassan.\n\nHe threw his empty Tommy-Noiseless to the side. All he wanted now was\nsleep, the surcease of a few hours of oblivion.\n\nIsobel, her face wan from the horror of the agony of the combat whose\nresult was everywhere visible, was picking her way through the\nwreckage with Cliff Jackson.\n\nEl Hassan looked at her absently. Whatever message she bore held\nlittle interest to him.\n\nCliff said, \"India has recognized El Hassan as legal head of state of\nall North Africa. It is expected that Australia will follow before the\nweek is out.\"\n\nEl Hassan nodded. For the time, not caring.\n\nIsobel said, \"We have other word. It came by messenger.\" She closed\nher eyes in pain and handed him a small box.\n\nHe opened it and recognized the ring on the enclosed finger. He looked\nup at them.\n\nCliff Jackson growled low in his throat. \"Elmer Allen. He's been\ncaptured by a leader of the Ouled Touameur clan of the Ouled Allouch\ntribe. You know this Abd-el-Kader?\"\n\nEl Hassan was staring down at the finger, his mind slowly clearing of\nits fatigue. \"He belongs to the Berazga division of the Chaambra\nconfederation. I had a run-in with him a few months ago and had him\njailed. He's nothing but a desert bandit on the make.\"\n\nCliff said, \"He's escaped, has thrown his weight behind the Arab\nUnion, proclaimed himself the Mahdi and is uniting Algeria and parts\nof Morocco and Tunisia like a wildfire. The marabouts and Shorfa are\nbacking him.\"\n\n\"Proclaimed himself the Mahdi?\" Isobel said in question.\n\nEl Hassan turned to the girl and took a deep breath. \"The original\nMahdi was the holiest prophet since Mohammed and according to the more\nsuperstitious Moslems, he's still alive. According to Islamic\ntradition, he periodically shows up again in the desert and makes\nvarious predictions. When he does, it almost always winds up with a\njihad, a holy war. Don't you remember in history the anti-British\nMahdi at Khartoum, the killing of Chinese Gordon and so forth? That\nMahdi was the son of a Dongola carpenter and he managed to conquer two\nmillion square miles in two years.\"\n\n\"But, what has this got to do with this Abd-el-Kader?\"\n\n\"He's evidently proclaimed himself sort of a reincarnation of the\noriginal Mahdi. He's out to do the same thing we are--to unite North\nAfrica. But in his case he doesn't exactly have the same dream and\nhe's working under the green ensign of the Pan-Islamic Arab Union.\"\n\n\"And has Elmer Allen captive.\"\n\n\"Yes, he has Elmer.\" El Hassan's tone of voice turned sharp. \"Cliff,\ngo get Bey. Tell him we're forming a flying column and heading north.\"\n\nCliff was gone. El Hassan turned back to the girl. \"You know, Isobel,\"\nhe said softly, slowly, \"in history there is no happy ending, ever.\nThere is no ending at all. It goes from one crisis to another, but\nthere is no ending.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Border, Breed Nor Birth, by Dallas McCord Reynolds\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BORDER, BREED NOR BIRTH ***\n\n***** This file should be named 30639-8.txt or 30639-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/3\/0\/6\/3\/30639\/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http:\/\/www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1276,"split":"test"}
