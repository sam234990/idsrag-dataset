De Marmont replies that he has never led the Comte to suppose anything, the Comte has merely taken de Marmont\u2019s political convictions for granted.\nAs if two potential suitors weren\u2019t enough, Crystal has yet another admirer, Maurice de St. Genis, whose impecunious state (her father sees him as a penniless, out-at-elbows, good for nothing) has precluded him from obtaining her hand in marriage.\nHowever at the moment of Crystal\u2019s betrothal to de Marmont, Maurice finally gets his revenge upon his rival. Once the guests have assembled for the ceremony, there is a disturbance from the end of the corridor and St. Genis enters the room, his rough clothes and muddy boots providing a contrast to the immaculate get-up of the Comte\u2019s guests. Looking flushed and clutching his cane he announces that he has only come to avert the awful catastrophe that is about to fall on the Comte and his family.\nAt the young man\u2019s ominous words, M. le Comte goes pale and demands to know what catastrophe could be worse than twenty years of exile?\n\"An alliance with a traitor, M. le Comte\" he replies.\nSt. Genis goes on to accuse his rival of pinning Napoleon\u2019s proclamation on the walls of Grenoble. Yet, rather than deny the accusation de Marmont defends his actions with fervor, pulling a copy of the declaration from his pocket and waving it at the assembled group while shouting \u201cVive l\u2019Empereur\u201d.\nDespite the sudden rupture of her engagement, Crystal\u2018s heart is by no means broken, but it is not St. Genis who in the end wins her love, for we are left with the understanding that it is Clyffurde, the English merchant who eventually overrides the prejudices of the old French count.\nClyffurde laughingly asks Crystal\u2019s aunt, Mme. la Duchesse \u201cDo you think that if I promise never to buy or sell gloves again, but in future to try and live like a gentleman-he will consent?\u201d\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Bronze Eagle, by Emmuska Orczy, Baroness\nOrczy\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

The softness of\ndeparting night lies upon the bosom of the Mediterranean like the dew\nupon the heart of a flower.\n\nA silent dawn.\n\nVeils of transparent greys and purples and mauves still conceal the\ndistant horizon. Breathless calm rests upon the water and that awed hush\nwhich at times descends upon Nature herself when the finger of Destiny\nmarks an eventful hour.\n\nBut now the grey and the purple veils beyond the headland are lifted one\nby one; the midst of dawn rises upwards like the smoke of incense from\nsome giant censers swung by unseen, mighty hands.\n\nThe sky above is of a translucent green, studded with stars that blink\nand now are slowly extinguished one by one: the green has turned to\nsilver, and the silver to lemon-gold: the veils beyond the upland are\nflying in the wake of departing Night.\n\nThe lemon-gold turns to glowing amber, anon to orange and crimson, and\nfar inland the mountain peaks, peeping shyly through the mist, blush a\nvivid rose to find themselves so fair.\n\nAnd to the south, there where fiery sea blends and merges with fiery\nsky, a tiny black speck has just come into view. Larger and larger it\ngrows as it draws nearer to the land, now it seems like a bird with\nwings outspread--an eagle flying swiftly to the shores of France.\n\nIn the bay the fisher folk, who are making ready for their day's work,\npause a moment as they haul up their nets: with rough brown hands held\nabove their eyes they look out upon that black speck--curious,\ninterested, for the ship is not one they have seen in these waters\nbefore.\n\n\"'Tis the Emperor come back from Elba!\" says someone.\n\nThe men laugh and shrug their shoulders: that tale has been told so\noften in these parts during the past year: the good folk have ceased to\nbelieve in it. It has almost become a legend now, that story that the\nEmperor was coming back--their Emperor--the man with the battered hat\nand the grey redingote: the people's Emperor, he who led them from\nvictory to victory, whose eagles soared above every capital and every\ntower in Europe, he who made France glorious and respected: her\ncitizens, men, her soldiers, heroes.\n\nAnd with stately majesty the dawn yields to day, the last tones of\norange have faded from the sky: it is once more of a translucent green\nmerging into sapphire overhead. And the great orb in the east rises from\nout the trammels of the mist, and from awakening Earth and Sea comes the\ngreat love-call, the triumphant call of Day. And far away upon the\nhorizon to the south, the black speck becomes more distinct and more\nclear; it takes shape, substance, life.\n\nIt divides and multiplies, for now there are three or four specks\nsilhouetted against the sky--not three or four, but five--no! six--no!\nseven! Seven black specks which detach themselves one by one, one from\nanother and from the vagueness beyond--experienced eyes scan the horizon\nwith enthusiasm and excitement which threaten to blur the clearness of\ntheir vision. Anyone with an eye for sea-going craft can distinguish\nthat topsail-schooner there, well ahead of the rest of the tiny fleet,\nskimming the water with swift grace, and immediately behind her the\nthree-masted polacca--hm! have we not seen her in these waters\nbefore?--and the two graceful feluccas whose lateen sails look so like\nthe outspread wings of a bird!\n\nBut it is on the schooner that all eyes are riveted now: she skips along\nso fast that within an hour her pennant is easily distinguishable--red\nand white! the flag of Elba, of that diminutive toy-kingdom which for\nthe past twelve months has been ruled over by the mightiest conqueror\nthis modern world has ever known.\n\nThe flag of Elba! then it is the Emperor coming back!\n\nA crowd had gathered on the headland now--a crowd made up of bare-footed\nfisher-folk, men, women, children, and of the labourers from the\nneighbouring fields and vineyards: they have all come to greet the\nEmperor--the man with the battered hat and the grey redingote, the\ncurious, flashing eyes and mouth that always spoke genial words to the\npeople of France!\n\nTraitors turned against him--Ney! de Marmont! Bernadotte! those on whom\nhe had showered the full measure of his friendship, whom he had loaded\nwith honours, with glory and with wealth. Foreign armies joined in\ncoalition against France and forced the people's Emperor to leave his\ncountry which he loved so well, had sent him to humiliation and to\nexile. But he had come back, as all his people had always said that he\nwould! He had come back, there was the topsail-schooner that was\nbringing him home so swiftly now.\n\nAnother hour and the schooner's name can be deciphered quite\neasily--_L'Inconstant_, and that of the polacca _Le Saint-Esprit_ .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nand beyond these _L'Etoile_ and _Saint Joseph_, _Caroline_. And the\nentire little fleet flies the flag of Elba.\n\nThe Emperor has come back! Bare-footed fisherfolk whisper it among\nthemselves, the labourers in the valley call the news to those upon the\nhills.\n\nWhy! after another hour or so, there are those among the small knot who\nstand congregated on the highest point of the headland, who swear that\nthey can see the Emperor--standing on the deck of the _L'Inconstant_.\n\nHe wears a black bicorne hat, and his grey redingote: he is pacing up\nand down the deck of the schooner, his hands held behind his back in the\nmanner so familiar to the people of France. And on his hat is pinned the\ntricolour of France. Everyone on shore who is on the look-out for the\nschooner now can see the tricolour quite plainly. A mighty shout escapes\nthe lusty throats of the men on the beach, the women are on the verge of\ntears from sheer excitement, and that shout is repeated again and again\nand sends its ringing echo from cliff to cliff, and from fort to fort as\nthe red and white pennant of the kingdom of Elba is hauled down from the\nship's stern and the tricolour flag--the flag of Liberty and of\nregenerate France--is hoisted in its stead.\n\nThe soft breeze from the south unfurls its folds and these respond to\nhis caress. The red, white and blue make a trenchant note of colour now\nagainst the tender hues of the sea: flaunting its triumphant message in\nthe face of awakening nature.\n\nThe eagle has left the bounds of its narrow cage of Elba: it has taken\nwing over the blue Mediterranean! within an hour, perhaps, or two, it\nwill rest on the square church tower of Antibes--but not for long. Soon\nit will take to its adventurous flight again, and soar over valley and\nmountain peak, from church belfry to church belfry until it finds its\nresting-place upon the towers of Notre Dame.\n\nOne hour after noon the curtain has risen upon the first act of the most\nadventurous tragedy the world has ever known.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte has landed in the bay of Jouan with eleven hundred\nmen and four guns to reconquer France and the sovereignty of the world.\nSix hundred of his old guard, six score of his Polish light cavalry,\nthree or four hundred Corsican chasseurs: thus did that sublime\nadventurer embark upon an expedition the most mad, the most daring, the\nmost heroic, the most egotistical, the most tragic and the most glorious\nwhich recording Destiny has ever written in the book of this world.\n\nThe boats were lowered at one hour after noon, and the landing was\nslowly and methodically begun: too slowly for the patience of the old\nguard--the old \"growlers\" with grizzled moustache and furrowed cheeks,\ndown which tears of joy and enthusiasm were trickling at sight of the\nshores of France. They were not going to wait for the return of those\nboats which had conveyed the Polish troopers on shore: they took to the\nwater and waded across the bay, tossing the salt spray all around them\nas they trod the shingle, like so many shaggy dogs enjoying a bath; and\nwhen six hundred fur bonnets darkened the sands of the bay at the foot\nof the Tower of la Gabelle, such a shout of \"Vive l'Empereur\" went forth\nfrom six hundred lusty throats that the midday spring air vibrated with\nkindred enthusiasm for miles and miles around.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE GLORIOUS NEWS\n\n\nI\n\nWhere the broad highway between Grenoble and Gap parts company from the\nturbulent Drac, and after crossing the ravine of Vaulx skirts the\nplateau of La Motte with its magnificent panorama of forests and\nmountain peaks, a narrow bridle path strikes off at a sharp angle on the\nleft and in wayward curves continues its length through the woods\nupwards to the hamlet of Vaulx and the shrine of Notre Dame.\n\nFar away to the west the valley of the Drac lies encircled by the\npine-covered slopes of the Lans range, whilst towering some seven\nthousand and more feet up the snow-clad crest of Grande Moucherolle\nglistens like a sea of myriads of rose-coloured diamonds under the kiss\nof the morning sun.\n\nThere was more than a hint of snow in the sharp, stinging air this\nafternoon, even down in the valley, and now the keen wind from the\nnortheast whipped up the faces of the two riders as they turned their\nhorses at a sharp trot up the bridle path.\n\nThough it was not long since the sun had first peeped out above the\nforests of Pelvoux, the riders looked as if they had already a long\njourney to their credit; their horses were covered with sweat and\nsprinkled with lather, and they themselves were plentifully bespattered\nwith mud, for the road in the valley was soft after the thaw. But\ndespite probable fatigue, both sat their horse with that ease and\nunconscious grace which marks the man accustomed to hard and constant\nriding, though--to the experienced eye--there would appear a vast\ndifference in the style and manner in which each horseman handled his\nmount.\n\nOne of them had the rigid precision of bearing which denotes military\ntraining: he was young and slight of build, with unruly dark hair\nfluttering round the temples from beneath his white sugar-loaf hat, and\nescaping the trammels of the neatly-tied black silk bow at the nape of\nthe neck; he held himself very erect and rode his horse on the curb, the\nreins gathered tightly in one gloved hand, and that hand held closely\nand almost immovably against his chest.\n\nThe other sat more carelessly--though in no way more loosely--in his\nsaddle: he gave his horse more freedom, with a chain-snaffle and reins\nhanging lightly between his fingers. He was obviously taller and\nprobably older than his companion, broader of shoulder and fairer of\nskin; you might imagine him riding this same powerful mount across a\nsweep of open country, but his friend you would naturally picture to\nyourself in uniform on the parade ground.\n\nThe riders soon left the valley of the Drac behind them; on ahead the\npath became very rocky, winding its way beside a riotous little mountain\nstream, whilst higher up still, peeping through the intervening trees,\nthe white-washed cottages of the tiny hamlet glimmered with dazzling\nclearness in the frosty atmosphere. At a sharp bend of the road, which\neffectually revealed the foremost of these cottages, distant less than\ntwo kilometres now, the younger of the two men drew rein suddenly, and\nlifting his hat with outstretched arm high above his head, he gave a\nlong sigh which ended in a kind of exultant call of joy.\n\n\"There is Notre Dame de Vaulx,\" he cried at the top of his voice, and\nhat still in hand he pointed to the distant hamlet. \"There's the spot\nwhere--before the sun darts its midday rays upon us--I shall hear great\nand glorious and authentic news of _him_ from a man who has seen him as\nlately as forty-eight hours ago, who has touched his hand, heard the\nsound of his voice, seen the look of confidence and of hope in his eyes.\nOh!\" he went on speaking with extraordinary volubility, \"it is all too\ngood to be true! Since yesterday I have felt like a man in a dream!--I\nhaven't lived, I have scarcely breathed, I .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nThe other man broke in upon his ravings with a good-humoured growl.\n\n\"You have certainly behaved like an escaped lunatic since early this\nmorning, my good de Marmont,\" he said drily. \"Don't you think that--as\nwe shall have to mix again with our fellow-men presently--you might try\nto behave with some semblance of reasonableness.\"\n\nBut de Marmont only laughed. He was so excited that his lips trembled\nall the time, his hand shook and his eyes glowed just as if some inward\nfire was burning deep down in his soul.\n\n\"No! I can't,\" he retorted. \"I want to shout and to sing and to cry\n'Vive l'Empereur' till those frowning mountains over there echo with my\nshouts--and I'll have none of your English stiffness and reserve and\ncurbing of enthusiasm to-day. I am a lunatic if you will--an escaped\nlunatic--if to be mad with joy be a proof of insanity. Clyffurde, my\ndear friend,\" he added more soberly, \"I am honestly sorry for you\nto-day.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" commented his companion drily. \"May I ask how I have\ndeserved this genuine sympathy?\"\n\n\"Well! because you are an Englishman, and not a Frenchman,\" said the\nyounger man earnestly; \"because you--as an Englishman--must desire\nNapoleon's downfall, his humiliation, perhaps his death, instead of\nexulting in his glory, trusting in his star, believing in him,\nfollowing him. If I were not a Frenchman on a day like this, if my\nnationality or my patriotism demanded that I should fight against\nNapoleon, that I should hate him, or vilify him, I firmly believe that I\nwould turn my sword against myself, so shamed should I feel in my own\neyes.\"\n\nIt was the Englishman's turn to laugh, and he did it very heartily. His\nlaugh was quite different to his friend's: it had more enjoyment in it,\nmore good temper, more appreciation of everything that tends to gaiety\nin life and more direct defiance of what is gloomy.\n\nHe too had reined in his horse, presumably in order to listen to his\nfriend's enthusiastic tirades, and as he did so there crept into his\nmerry, pleasant eyes a quaint look of half contemptuous tolerance\ntempered by kindly humour.\n\n\"Well, you see, my good de Marmont,\" he said, still laughing, \"you\nhappen to be a Frenchman, a visionary and weaver of dreams. Believe me,\"\nhe added more seriously, \"if you had the misfortune to be a prosy,\nshop-keeping Englishman, you would certainly not commit suicide just\nbecause you could not enthuse over your favourite hero, but you would\nrealise soberly and calmly that while Napoleon Bonaparte is allowed to\nrule over France--or over any country for the matter of that--there will\nnever be peace in the world or prosperity in any land.\"\n\nThe younger man made no reply. A shadow seemed to gather over his\nface--a look almost of foreboding, as if Fate that already lay in wait\nfor the great adventurer, had touched the young enthusiast with a\nwarning finger.\n\nWhereupon Clyffurde resumed gaily once more:\n\n\"Shall we,\" he said, \"go slowly on now as far as the village? It is not\nyet ten o'clock. Emery cannot possibly be here before noon.\"\n\nHe put his horse to a walk, de Marmont keeping close behind him, and in\nsilence the two men rode up the incline toward Notre Dame de Vaulx. On\nahead the pines and beech and birch became more sparse, disclosing the\ngreat patches of moss-covered rock upon the slopes of Pelvoux. On\nTaillefer the eternal snows appeared wonderfully near in the brilliance\nof this early spring atmosphere, and here and there on the roadside\nbunches of wild crocus and of snowdrops were already visible rearing\ntheir delicate corollas up against a background of moss.\n\nThe tiny village still far away lay in the peaceful hush of a Sunday\nmorning, only from the little chapel which holds the shrine of Notre\nDame came the sweet, insistent sound of the bell calling the dwellers of\nthese mountain fastnesses to prayer.\n\nThe northeasterly wind was still keen, but the sun was gaining power as\nit rose well above Pelvoux, and the sky over the dark forests and\nsnow-crowned heights was of a glorious and vivid blue.\n\n\nII\n\nThe words \"Auberge du Grand Dauphin\" looked remarkably inviting, written\nin bold, shiny black characters on the white-washed wall of one of the\nforemost houses in the village. The riders drew rein once more, this\ntime in front of the little inn, and as a young ostler in blue blouse\nand sabots came hurriedly and officiously forward whilst mine host in\nthe same attire appeared in the doorway, the two men dismounted,\nunstrapped their mantles from their saddle-bows and loudly called for\nmulled wine.\n\nMine host, typical of his calling and of his race, rubicund of cheek,\nportly of figure and genial in manner, was over-anxious to please his\nguests. It was not often that gentlemen of such distinguished appearance\ncalled at the \"Auberge du Grand Dauphin,\" seeing that Notre Dame de\nVaulx lies perdu on the outskirts of the forests of Pelvoux, that the\nbridle path having reached the village leads nowhere save into the\nmountains and that La Motte is close by with its medicinal springs and\nits fine hostels.\n\nBut these two highly-distinguished gentlemen evidently meant to make a\nstay of it. They even spoke of a friend who would come and join them\nlater, when they would expect a substantial _d\u00c3\u00a9jeuner_ to be served with\nthe best wine mine host could put before them. Annette--mine host's\ndark-eyed daughter--was all a-flutter at sight of these gallant\nstrangers, one of them with such fiery eyes and vivacious ways, and the\nother so tall and so dignified, with fair skin well-bronzed by the sun\nand large firm mouth that had such a pleasant smile on it; her eyes\nsparkled at sight of them both and her glib tongue rattled away at truly\nastonishing speed.\n\nWould a well-baked omelette and a bit of fricandeau suit the\ngentlemen?--Admirably? Ah, well then, that could easily be done!--and\nnow? in the meanwhile?--Only good mulled wine? That would present no\ndifficulty either. Five minutes for it to get really hot, as Annette had\nmade some the previous day for her father who had been on a tiring\nerrand up to La Mure and had come home cold and starved--and it was\nspecially good--all the better for having been hotted up once or twice\nand the cloves and nutmeg having soaked in for nearly four and twenty\nhours.\n\nWhere would the gentlemen have it--Outside in the sunshine? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Well!\nit was very cold, and the wind biting .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but the gentlemen had\nmantles, and she, Annette, would see that the wine was piping hot. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nFive minutes and everything would be ready. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\n\nWhat? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. the tall, fair-skinned gentleman wanted to wash? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. what\na funny idea! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. hadn't he washed this morning when he got up? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nHe had? Well, then, why should he want to wash again? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. She,\nAnnette, managed to keep herself quite clean all day, and didn't need\nto wash more than once a day. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. But there! strangers had funny ways\nwith them .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. she had guessed at once that Monsieur was a stranger, he\nhad such a fair skin and light brown hair. Well! so long as Monsieur\nwasn't English--for the English, she detested!\n\nWhy did she detest the English? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Because they made war against\nFrance. Well! against the Emperor anyhow, and she, Annette, firmly\nbelieved that if the English could get hold of the Emperor they would\nkill him--oh, yes! they would put him on an island peopled by cannibals\nand let him be eaten, bones, marrow and all.\n\nAnd Annette's dark eyes grew very round and very big as she gave forth\nher opinion upon the barbarous hatred of the English for \"l'Empereur!\"\nShe prattled on very gaily and very volubly, while she dragged a couple\nof chairs out into the open, and placed them well in the lee of the wind\nand brought a couple of pewter mugs which she set on the table.\n\nShe was very much interested in the tall gentleman who had availed\nhimself of her suggestion to use the pump at the back of the house,\nsince he was so bent on washing himself; and she asked many questions\nabout him from his friend.\n\nTen minutes later the steaming wine was on the table in a huge china\nbowl and the Englishman was ladling it out with a long-handled spoon and\nfilling the two mugs with the deliciously scented cordial. Annette had\ndisappeared into the house in response to a peremptory call from her\nfather. The chapel bell had ceased to ring long ago, and she would miss\nhearing Mass altogether to-day; and M. le cur\u00c3\u00a9, who came on alternate\nSundays all the way from La Motte to celebrate divine service, would be\nvery angry indeed with her.\n\nWell! that couldn't be helped! Annette would have loved to go to Mass,\nbut the two distinguished gentlemen expected their friend to arrive at\nnoon, and the _d\u00c3\u00a9jeuner_ to be ready quite by then; so she comforted her\nconscience with a few prayers said on her knees before the picture of\nthe Holy Virgin which hung above her bed, after which she went back to\nher housewifely duty with a light heart; but not before she had decided\nan important point in her mind--namely, which of those two handsome\ngentlemen she liked the best: the dark one with the fiery eyes that\nexpressed such bold admiration of her young charms, or the tall one with\nthe earnest grey eyes who looked as if he could pick her up like a\nfeather and carry her running all the way to the summit of Taillefer.\n\nAnnette had indeed made up her mind that the giant with the soft brown\nhair and winning smile was, on the whole, the more attractive of the\ntwo.\n\n\nIII\n\nThe two friends, with mantles wrapped closely round them, sat outside\nthe \"Grand Dauphin\" all unconscious of the problem which had been\ndisturbing Annette's busy little brain.\n\nThe steaming wine had put plenty of warmth into their bones, and though\nboth had been silent while they sipped their first mug-full, it was\nobvious that each was busy with his own thoughts.\n\nThen suddenly the young Frenchman put his mug down and leaned with both\nelbows upon the rough deal table, because he wanted to talk\nconfidentially with his friend, and there was never any knowing what\nprying ears might be about.\n\n\"I suppose,\" he said, even as a deep frown told of puzzling thoughts\nwithin the mind, \"I suppose that when England hears the news, she will\nup and at him again, attacking him, snarling at him even before he has\nhad time to settle down upon his reconquered throne.\"\n\n\"That throne is not reconquered yet, my friend,\" retorted the Englishman\ndrily, \"nor has the news of this mad adventure reached England so far,\nbut .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"But when it does,\" broke in de Marmont sombrely, \"your Castlereagh will\nrave and your Wellington will gather up his armies to try and crush the\nhero whom France loves and acclaims.\"\n\n\"Will France acclaim the hero, there's the question?\"\n\n\"The army will--the people will----\"\n\nClyffurde shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"The army, yes,\" he said slowly, \"but the people .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. what people?--the\npeasantry of Provence and the Dauphin\u00c3\u00a9, perhaps--what about the town\nfolk?--your mayors and _pr\u00c3\u00a9fets_?--your tradespeople? your shopkeepers\nwho have been ruined by the wars which your hero has made to further his\nown ambition. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Don't say that, Clyffurde,\" once more broke in de Marmont, and this\ntime more vehemently than before. \"When you speak like that I could\nalmost forget our friendship.\"\n\n\"Whether I say it or not, my good de Marmont,\" rejoined Clyffurde with\nhis good-humoured smile, \"you will anyhow--within the next few\nmonths--days, perhaps--bury our friendship beneath the ashes of your\npatriotism. No one, believe me,\" he added more earnestly, \"has a greater\nadmiration for the genius of Napoleon than I have; his love of France is\nsublime, his desire for her glory superb. But underlying his love of\ncountry, there is the love of self, the mad desire to rule, to conquer,\nto humiliate. It led him to Moscow and thence to Elba, it has brought\nhim back to France. It will lead him once again to the Capitol, no\ndoubt, but as surely too it will lead him on to the Tarpeian Rock whence\nhe will be hurled down this time, not only bruised, but shattered, a\nfallen hero--and you will--a broken idol, for posterity to deal with in\nafter time as it lists.\"\n\n\"And England would like to be the one to give the hero the final push,\"\nsaid de Marmont, not without a sneer.\n\n\"The people of England, my friend, hate and fear Bonaparte as they have\nnever hated and feared any one before in the whole course of their\nhistory--and tell me, have we not cause enough to hate him? For fifteen\nyears has he not tried to ruin us, to bring us to our knees? tried to\nthrottle our commerce? break our might upon the sea? He wanted to make a\nslave of Britain, and Britain proved unconquerable. Believe me, we hate\nyour hero less than he hates us.\"\n\nHe had spoken with a good deal of earnestness, but now he added more\nlightly, as if in answer to de Marmont's glowering look:\n\n\"At the same time,\" he said, \"I doubt if there is a single English\ngentleman living at the present moment--let alone the army--who would\nrefuse ungrudging admiration to Napoleon himself and to his genius. But\nas a nation England has her interests to safeguard. She has suffered\nenough--and through him--in her commerce and her prosperity in the past\ntwenty years--she must have peace now at any cost.\"\n\n\"Ah! I know,\" sighed the other, \"a nation of shopkeepers. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Yes. We are that, I suppose. We are shopkeepers .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. most of us.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to use the word in any derogatory sense,\" protested\nVictor de Marmont with the ready politeness peculiar to his race. \"Why,\neven you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"I don't see why you should say 'even you,'\" broke in Clyffurde quietly.\n\"I am a shopkeeper--nothing more. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I buy goods and sell them again.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I buy the gloves which our friend M. Dumoulin manufactures at\nGrenoble and sell them to any London draper who chooses to buy them\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. a very mean and ungentlemanly occupation, is it not?\"\n\nHe spoke French with perfect fluency, and only with the merest suspicion\nof a drawl in the intonation of the vowels, which suggested rather than\nproclaimed his nationality; and just now there was not the slightest\ntone of bitterness apparent in his deep-toned and mellow voice. Once\nmore his friend would have protested, but he put up a restraining hand.\n\n\"Oh!\" he said with a smile, \"I don't imagine for a moment that you have\nthe same prejudices as our mutual friend M. le Comte de Cambray, who\nmust have made a very violent sacrifice to his feelings when he admitted\nme as a guest to his own table. I am sure he must often think that the\nservants' hall is the proper place for me.\"\n\n\"The Comte de Cambray,\" retorted de Marmont with a sneer, \"is full up to\nhis eyes with the prejudices and arrogance of his caste. It is men of\nhis type--and not Marat or Robespierre--who made the revolution, who\ngoaded the people of France into becoming something worse than\nman-devouring beasts. And, mind you, twenty years of exile did not sober\nthem, nor did contact with democratic thought in England and America\nteach them the most elementary lessons of commonsense. If the Emperor\nhad not come back to-day, we should be once more working up for\nrevolution--more terrible this time, more bloody and vengeful, if\npossible, than the last.\"\n\nThen as Clyffurde made no comment on this peroration, the younger man\nresumed more lightly:\n\n\"And--knowing the Comte de Cambray's prejudices as I do, imagine my\nsurprise--after I had met you in his house as an honoured guest and on\nwhat appeared to be intimate terms of friendship--to learn that you\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. in fact .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"That I was nothing more than a shopkeeper,\" broke in Clyffurde with a\nshort laugh, \"nothing better than our mutual friend M. Dumoulin,\nglovemaker, of Grenoble--a highly worthy man whom M. le Comte de Cambray\nesteems somewhat lower than his butler. It certainly must have surprised\nyou very much.\"\n\n\"Well, you know, old de Cambray has a horror of anything that pertains\nto trade, and an avowed contempt for everything that he calls\n'bourgeois.'\"\n\n\"There's no doubt about that,\" assented Clyffurde fervently.\n\n\"Perhaps he does not know of your connection with .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Gloves?\"\n\n\"With business people in Grenoble generally.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, he does!\" replied the Englishman quietly.\n\n\"Well, then?\" queried de Marmont.\n\nThen as his friend sat there silent with that quiet, good-humoured smile\nlingering round his lips, he added apologetically:\n\n\"Perhaps I am indiscreet .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but I never could understand it .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and\nyou English are so reserved .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"That I never told you how M. le Comte de Cambray, Commander of the\nOrder of the Holy Ghost, Grand Cross of the Order du Lys, Hereditary\nGrand Chamberlain of France, etc., etc., came to sit at the same table\nas a vendor and buyer of gloves,\" said Clyffurde gaily. \"There's no\nsecret about it. I owe the Comte's exalted condescension to certain\nletters of recommendation which he could not very well disregard.\"\n\n\"Oh! as to that .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" quoth de Marmont with a shrug of the shoulders,\n\"people like the de Cambrays have their own codes of courtesy and of\nfriendship.\"\n\n\"In this case, my good de Marmont, it was the code of ordinary gratitude\nthat imposed its dictum even upon the autocratic and aristocratic Comte\nde Cambray.\"\n\n\"Gratitude?\" sneered de Marmont, \"in a de Cambray?\"\n\n\"M. le Comte de Cambray,\" said Clyffurde with slow emphasis, \"his\nmother, his sister, his brother-in-law and two of their faithful\nservants, were rescued from the very foot of the guillotine by a band of\nheroes--known in those days as the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel.\"\n\n\"I knew that!\" said de Marmont quietly.\n\n\"Then perhaps you also knew that their leader was Sir Percy Blakeney--a\nprince among gallant English gentlemen and my dead father's friend. When\nmy business affairs sent me to Grenoble, Sir Percy warmly recommended me\nto the man whose life he had saved. What could M. le Comte de Cambray do\nbut receive me as a friend? You see, my credentials were exceptional and\nunimpeachable.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" assented de Marmont, \"now I understand. But you will admit\nthat I have had grounds for surprise. You--who were the friend of\nDumoulin, a tradesman, and avowed Bonapartist--two unpardonable crimes\nin the eyes of M. le Comte de Cambray,\" he added with a return to his\nformer bitterness, \"you to be seated at his table and to shake him by\nthe hand. Why, man! if he knew that I have remained faithful to the\nEmperor .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHe paused abruptly, and his somewhat full, sensitive lips were pressed\ntightly together as if to suppress an insistent outburst of passion.\n\nBut Clyffurde frowned, and when he turned away from de Marmont it was in\norder to hide a harsh look of contempt.\n\n\"Surely,\" he said, \"you have never led the Comte to suppose that you are\na royalist!\"\n\n\"I have never led him to suppose anything. But he has taken my political\nconvictions for granted,\" rejoined de Marmont.\n\nThen suddenly a look of bitter resentment darkened his face, making it\nappear hard and lined and considerably older.\n\n\"My uncle, Marshal de Marmont, Duc de Raguse, was an abominable\ntraitor,\" he went on with ill-repressed vehemence. \"He betrayed his\nEmperor, his benefactor and his friend. It was the vilest treachery that\nhas ever disgraced an honourable name. Paris could have held out easily\nfor another four and twenty hours, and by that time the Emperor would\nhave been back. But de Marmont gave her over wilfully, scurvily to the\nallies. But for his abominable act of cowardice the Emperor never would\nhave had to endure the shame of his temporary exile at Elba, and Louis\nde Bourbon would never have had the chance of wallowing for twelve\nmonths upon the throne of France. But that which is a source of\nirreparable shame to me is a virtue in the eyes of all these royalists.\nDe Marmont's treachery against the Emperor has placed all his kindred in\nthe forefront of those who now lick the boots of that infamous Bourbon\ndynasty, and it did not suit the plans of the Bonapartist party that\nwe--in the provinces--should proclaim our faith too openly until such\ntime as the Emperor returned.\"\n\n\"And if the Comte de Cambray had known that you are just an ardent\nBonapartist? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" suggested Clyffurde calmly.\n\n\"He would long before now have had me kicked out by his lacqueys,\" broke\nin de Marmont with ever-increasing bitterness as he brought his clenched\nfist crashing down upon the table, while his dark eyes glowed with a\nfierce and passionate resentment. \"For men like de Cambray there is only\none caste--the _noblesse_, one religion--the Catholic, one\ncreed--adherence to the Bourbons. All else is scum, trash, beneath\ncontempt, hardly human! Oh! if you knew how I loathe these people!\" he\ncontinued, speaking volubly and in a voice shaking with suppressed\nexcitement. \"They have learnt nothing, these aristocrats, nothing, I\ntell you! the terrible reprisals of the revolution which culminated in\nthat appalling Reign of Terror have taught them absolutely nothing! They\nhave not learnt the great lesson of the revolution, that the people will\nno longer endure their arrogance and their pretensions, that the old\nregime is dead--dead! the regime of oppression and pride and\nintolerance! They have learnt nothing!\" he reiterated with ever-growing\nexcitement, \"nothing! 'humanity begins with the _noblesse_' is still\ntheir watchword to-day as it was before the irate people sent hundreds\nof them to perish miserably on the guillotine--the rest of mankind, to\nthem, is only cattle made to toil for the well-being of their class. Oh!\nI loathe them, I tell you! I loathe them from the bottom of my soul!\"\n\n\"And yet you and your kind are rapidly becoming at one with them,\" said\nClyffurde, his quiet voice in strange contrast to the other man's\nviolent agitation.\n\n\"No, we are not,\" protested de Marmont emphatically. \"The men whom\nNapoleon created marshals and peers of France have been openly snubbed\nat the Court of Louis XVIII. Ney, who is prince of Moskowa and next to\nNapoleon himself the greatest soldier of France, has seen his wife\ntreated little better than a chambermaid by the Duchesse d'Angoul\u00c3\u00aame and\nthe ladies of the old _noblesse_. My uncle is marshal of France, and Duc\nde Raguse and I am the heir to his millions, but the Comte de Cambray\nwill always consider it a mesalliance for his daughter to marry me.\"\n\nThe note of bitter resentment, of wounded pride and smouldering hatred\nbecame more and more marked while he spoke: his voice now sounded hoarse\nand his throat seemed dry. Presently he raised his mug to his lips and\ndrank eagerly, but his hand was shaking visibly as he did this, and some\nof the wine was spilled on the table.\n\nThere was silence for a while outside the little inn, silence which\nseemed full of portent, for through the pure mountain air there was\nwafted the hot breath of men's passions--fierce, dominating,\nchallenging. Love, hatred, prejudices and contempt--all were portrayed\non de Marmont's mobile face: they glowed in his dark eyes and breathed\nthrough his quivering nostrils. Now he rested his elbow on the table and\nhis chin in his hand, his nervy fingers played a tattoo against his\nteeth, clenched together like those of some young feline creature which\nsees its prey coming along and is snarling at the sight.\n\nClyffurde, with those deep-set, earnest grey eyes of his, was silently\nwatching his friend. His hand did not shake, nor did the breath come any\nquicker from his broad chest. Yet deep down behind the wide brow, behind\nthose same overshadowed eyes, a keen observer would of a surety have\ndetected the signs of a latent volcano of passions, all the more strong\nand virile as they were kept in perfect control. It was he who presently\nbroke the silence, and his voice was quite steady when he spoke, though\nperhaps a trifle more toneless, more dead, than usual.\n\n\"And,\" he said, \"what of Mlle. Crystal in all this?\"\n\n\"Crystal?\" queried the other curtly, \"what about her?\"\n\n\"She is an ardent royalist, more strong in her convictions and her\nenthusiasms than women usually are.\"\n\n\"And what of that?\" rejoined de Marmont fiercely. \"I love Crystal.\"\n\n\"But when she learns that you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"She shall not learn it,\" rejoined the other cynically. \"We sign our\nmarriage contract to-night: the wedding is fixed for Tuesday. Until then\nI can hold my peace.\"\n\nAn exclamation of hot protest almost escaped the Englishman's lips: his\nhand which rested on the table became so tightly clenched that the hard\nknuckles looked as if they would burst through their fetters of sinew\nand skin, and he made no pretence at concealing the look of burning\nindignation which flashed from his eyes.\n\n\"But man!\" he exclaimed, \"a deception such as you propose is cruel and\nmonstrous. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. In view, too, of what has occurred in the past few days\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. in view of what may happen if the news which we have heard is true\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"In view of all that, my friend,\" retorted de Marmont firmly, \"the old\nregime has had its nine days of wonder and of splendour. The Emperor has\ncome back! we, who believe in him, who have remained true to him in his\nhumiliation and in his misfortunes may once more raise our heads and\nloudly proclaim our loyalty. The return of the Emperor will once more\nput his dukes and his marshals in their rightful place on a level with\nthe highest nobility of France. The Comte de Cambray will realise that\nall his hopes of regaining his fortune through the favours of the\nBourbons have by force of circumstances come to naught. Like most of the\nold _noblesse_ who emigrated he is without a sou. He may choose to look\non me with contempt, but he will no longer desire to kick me out of his\nhouse, for he will be glad enough to see the Cambray 'scutcheon regilt\nwith de Marmont gold.\"\n\n\"But Mademoiselle Crystal?\" insisted Clyffurde, almost appealingly, for\nhis whole soul had revolted at the cynicism of the other man.\n\n\"Crystal has listened to that ape, St. Genis,\" replied de Marmont drily,\n\"one of her own caste .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. a marquis with sixteen quarterings to his\nfamily escutcheon and not a sou in his pockets. She is very young, and\nvery inexperienced. She has seen nothing of the world as yet--nothing.\nShe was born and brought up in exile--in England, in the midst of that\nnarrow society formed by impecunious _\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9s_. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"And shopkeeping Englishmen,\" murmured Clyffurde, under his breath.\n\n\"She could never have married St. Genis,\" reiterated Victor de Marmont\nwith deliberate emphasis. \"The man hasn't a sou. Even Crystal realised\nfrom the first that nothing ever could have come of that boy and girl\ndallying. The Comte never would have consented. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not. But she--Mademoiselle Crystal--would she ever have\nconsented to marry you, if she had known what your convictions are?\"\n\n\"Crystal is only a child,\" said de Marmont with a light shrug of the\nshoulders. \"She will learn to love me presently when St. Genis has\ndisappeared out of her little world, and she will accept my convictions\nas she has accepted me, submissive to my will as she was to that of her\nfather.\"\n\nOnce more a hot protest of indignation rose to Clyffurde's lips, but\nthis too he smothered resolutely. What was the use of protesting? Could\nhe hope to change with a few arguments the whole cynical nature of a\nman? And what right had he even to interfere? The Comte de Cambray and\nMademoiselle Crystal were nothing to him: in their minds they would\nnever look upon him even as an equal--let alone as a friend. So the\nbitter words died upon his lips.\n\n\"And you have been content to win a wife on such terms!\" was all that he\nsaid.\n\n\"I have had to be content,\" was de Marmont's retort. \"Crystal is the\nonly woman I have ever cared for. She will love me in time, I doubt not,\nand her sense of duty will make her forget St. Genis quickly enough.\"\n\nThen as Clyffurde made no further comment silence fell once more between\nthe two men. Perhaps even de Marmont felt that somehow, during the past\nfew moments, the slender bond of friendship which similarity of tastes\nand a certain similarity of political ideals had forged between him and\nthe stranger had been strained to snapping point, and this for a reason\nwhich he could not very well understand. He drank another draught of\nwine and gave a quick sigh of satisfaction with the world in general,\nand also with himself, for he did not feel that he had done or said\nanything which could offend the keenest susceptibilities of his friend.\n\nHe looked with a sudden sense of astonishment at Clyffurde, as if he\nwere only seeing him now for the first time. His keen dark eyes took in\nwith a rapid glance the Englishman's powerful personality, the square\nshoulders, the head well erect, the strong Anglo-Saxon chin firmly set,\nthe slender hands always in repose. In the whole attitude of the man\nthere was an air of will-power which had never struck de Marmont quite\nso forcibly as it did now, and a virility which looked as ready to\nchallenge Fate as it was able to conquer her if she proved adverse.\n\nAnd just now there was a curious look in those deep-set eyes--a look of\ncontempt or of pity--de Marmont was not sure which, but somehow the look\nworried him and he would have given much to read the thoughts which were\nhidden behind the high, square brow.\n\nHowever, he asked no questions, and thus the silence remained unbroken\nfor some time save for the soughing of the northeast wind as it whistled\nthrough the pines, whilst from the tiny chapel which held the shrine of\nNotre Dame de Vaulx came the sound of a soft-toned bell, ringing the\nmidday Angelus.\n\nJust then round that same curve in the road, where the two riders had\npaused an hour ago in sight of the little hamlet, a man on horseback\nappeared, riding at a brisk trot up the rugged, stony path.\n\nVictor de Marmont woke from his r\u00c3\u00aaverie:\n\n\"There's Emery,\" he cried.\n\nHe jumped to his feet, then he picked up his hat from the table where he\nhad laid it down, tossed it up into the air as high as it would go, and\nshouted with all his might:\n\n\"Vive l'Empereur!\"\n\n\nIV\n\nThe man who now drew rein with abrupt clumsiness in front of the auberge\nlooked hot, tired and travel-stained. His face was covered with sweat\nand his horse with lather, the lapel of his coat was torn, his breeches\nand boots were covered with half-frozen mud.\n\nBut having brought his horse to a halt, he swung himself out of the\nsaddle with the brisk air of a boy who has enjoyed his first ride across\ncountry. Surgeon-Captain Emery was a man well over forty, but to-day his\neyes glowed with that concentrated fire which burns in the heart at\ntwenty, and he shook de Marmont by the hand with a vigour which made the\nyounger man wince with the pain of that iron grip.\n\n\"My friend, Mr. Clyffurde, an English gentleman,\" said Victor de Marmont\nhastily in response to a quick look of suspicious enquiry which flashed\nout from under Emery's bushy eyebrows. \"You can talk quite freely,\nEmery; and for God's sake tell us your news!\"\n\nBut Emery could hardly speak. He had been riding hard for the past three\nhours, his throat was parched, and through it his voice came up hoarse\nand raucous: nevertheless he at once began talking in short, jerky\nsentences.\n\n\"He landed on Wednesday,\" he said. \"I parted from him on Friday .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. at\nCastellane .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you had my message?\"\n\n\"This morning early--we came at once.\"\n\n\"I thought we could talk better here--first--but I was spent last\nnight--I had to sleep at Corps .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. so I sent to you. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. But now, in\nHeaven's name, give me something to drink. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nWhile he drank eagerly and greedily of the cold spiced wine which\nClyffurde had served out to him, he still scrutinised the Englishman\nclosely from under his frowning and bushy eyebrows.\n\nClyffurde's winning glance, however, seemed to have conquered his\nmistrust, for presently, after he had put his mug down again, he\nstretched out a cordial hand to him.\n\n\"Now that our Emperor is back with us,\" he said as if in apology for his\nformer suspicions, \"we, his friends, are bound to look askance at every\nEnglishman we meet.\"\n\n\"Of course you are,\" said Clyffurde with his habitual good-humoured\nsmile as he grasped Surgeon-Captain Emery's extended hand.\n\n\"It is the hand of a friend I am grasping?\" insisted Emery.\n\n\"Of a personal friend, if you will call him so,\" replied Clyffurde.\n\"Politically, I hardly count, you see. I am just a looker-on at the\ngame.\"\n\nThe surgeon-captain's keen eyes under their bushy brows shot a rapid\nglance at the tall, well-knit figure of the Englishman.\n\n\"You are not a fighting man?\" he queried, much amazed.\n\n\"No,\" replied Clyffurde drily. \"I am only a tradesman.\"\n\n\"Your news, Emery, your news!\" here broke in Victor de Marmont, who\nduring the brief colloquy between his two friends had been hardly able\nto keep his excitement in check.\n\nEmery turned away from the other man in silence. Clearly there was\nsomething about that fine, noble-looking fellow--who proclaimed himself\na tradesman while that splendid physique of his should be at his\ncountry's service--which still puzzled the worthy army surgeon.\n\nBut he was primarily very thirsty and secondly as eager to impart his\nnews as de Marmont was to hear it, so now without wasting any further\nwords on less important matter he sat down close to the table and\nstretched his short, thick legs out before him.\n\n\"My news is of the best,\" he said with lusty fervour. \"We left Porto\nFerrajo on Sunday last but only landed on Wednesday, as I told you, for\nwe were severely becalmed in the Mediterranean. We came on shore at\nAntibes at midday of March 1st and bivouacked in an olive grove on the\nway to Cannes. That was a sight good for sore eyes, my friends, to see\nhim sitting there by the camp fire, his feet firmly planted upon the\nsoil of France. What a man, Sir, what a man!\" he continued, turning\ndirectly to Clyffurde, \"on board the _Inconstant_ he had composed and\ndictated his proclamation to the army, to the soldiers of France! the\nfinest piece of prose, Sir, I have ever read in all my life. But you\nshall judge of it, Sir, you shall judge. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nAnd with hands shaking with excitement he fumbled in the bulging pocket\nof his coat and extracted therefrom a roll of loose papers roughly tied\ntogether with a piece of tape.\n\n\"You shall read it, Sir,\" he went on mumbling, while his trembling\nfingers vainly tried to undo the knot in the tape, \"you shall read it.\nAnd then mayhap you'll tell me if your Pitt was ever half so eloquent.\nCurse these knots!\" he exclaimed angrily.\n\n\"Will you allow me, Sir?\" said Clyffurde quietly, and with steady hand\nand firm fingers he undid the refractory knots and spread the papers out\nupon the table.\n\nAlready de Marmont had given a cry of loyalty and of triumph.\n\n\"His proclamation!\" he exclaimed, and a sigh of infinite satisfaction\nborn of enthusiasm and of hero-worship escaped his quivering lips.\n\nThe papers bore the signature of that name which had once been\nall-powerful in its magical charm, at sound of which Europe had trembled\nand crowns had felt insecure, the name which men had breathed--nay!\nstill breathed--either with passionate loyalty or with bitter\nhatred:--\"Napoleon.\"\n\nThey were copies of the proclamation wherewith the heroic\nadventurer--confident in the power of his diction--meant to reconquer\nthe hearts of that army whom he had once led to such glorious victories.\n\nDe Marmont read the long document through from end to end in a\nhalf-audible voice. Now and again he gave a little cry--a cry of loyalty\nat mention of those victories of Austerlitz and Jena, of Wagram and of\nEckm\u00c3\u00bchl, at mention of those imperial eagles which had led the armies of\nFrance conquering and glorious throughout the length and breadth of\nEurope--or a cry of shame and horror at mention of the traitor whose\nname he bore and who had delivered France into the hands of strangers\nand his Emperor into those of his enemies.\n\nAnd when the young enthusiast had read the proclamation through to the\nend he raised the paper to his lips and fervently kissed the imprint of\nthe revered name: \"Napoleon.\"\n\n\"Now tell me more about him,\" he said finally, as he leaned both elbows\non the table and fastened his glowing eyes upon the equally heated face\nof Surgeon-Captain Emery.\n\n\"Well!\" resumed the latter, \"as I told you we bivouacked among the olive\ntrees on the way to Cannes. The Emperor had already sent Cambronne on\nahead with forty of his grenadiers to commandeer what horses and mules\nhe could, as we were not able to bring many across from Porto Ferrajo.\n'Cambronne,' he said, 'you shall be in command of the vanguard in this\nthe finest campaign which I have ever undertaken. My orders are to you,\nthat you do not fire a single unnecessary shot. Remember that I mean to\nreconquer my imperial crown without shedding one drop of French blood.'\nOh! he is in excellent health and in excellent spirits! Such a man! such\nfire in his eyes! such determination in his actions! Younger, bolder\nthan ever! I tell you, friends,\" continued the worthy surgeon-captain as\nhe brought the palm of his hand flat down upon the table with an\nemphatic bang, \"that it is going to be a triumphal march from end to end\nof France. The people are mad about him. At Roccavignon, just outside\nCannes, where we bivouacked on Thursday, men, women and children were\nflocking round to see him, pressing close to his knees, bringing him\nwine and flowers; and the people were crying 'Vive l'Empereur!' even in\nthe streets of Grasse.\"\n\n\"But the army, man? the army?\" cried de Marmont, \"the garrisons of\nAntibes and Cannes and Grasse? did the men go over to him at once?--and\nthe officers?\"\n\n\"We hadn't encountered the army yet when I parted from him on Friday,\"\nretorted Emery with equal impatience, \"we didn't go into Antibes and we\navoided Cannes. You must give him time. The people in the towns wouldn't\nat first believe that he had come back. General Mass\u00c3\u00a9na, who is in\ncommand at Marseilles, thought fit to spread the news that a band of\nCorsican pirates had landed on the littoral and were marching\ninland--devastating villages as they marched. The peasants from the\nmountains were the first to believe that the Emperor had really come,\nand they wandered down in their hundreds to see him first and to spread\nthe news of his arrival ahead of him. By the time we reached Castellane\nthe mayor was not only ready to receive him but also to furnish him with\n5,000 rations of meat and bread, with horses and with mules. Since then\nhe has been at Digue and at Sisteron. Be sure that the garrisons of\nthose cities have rallied round his eagles by now.\"\n\nThen whilst Emery paused for breath de Marmont queried eagerly:\n\n\"And so .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. there has been no contretemps?\"\n\n\"Nothing serious so far,\" replied the other. \"We had to abandon our guns\nat Grasse, the Emperor felt that they would impede the rapidity of his\nprogress; and our second day's march was rather trying, the mountain\npasses were covered in snow, the lancers had to lead their horses\nsometimes along the edge of sheer precipices, they were hampered too by\ntheir accoutrements, their long swords and their lances; others--who had\nno mounts--had to carry their heavy saddles and bridles on those\nslippery paths. But _he_ was walking too, stick in hand, losing his\nfooting now and then, just as they did, and once he nearly rolled down\none of those cursed precipices: but always smiling, always cheerful,\nalways full of hope. At Antibes young Casabianca got himself arrested\nwith twenty grenadiers--they had gone into the town to requisition a few\nprovisions. When the news reached us some of the younger men tried to\npersuade the Emperor to march on the city and carry the place by force\nof arms before Casabianca's misfortune got bruited abroad: 'No!' he\nsaid, 'every minute is precious. All we can do is to get along faster\nthan the evil news can travel. If half my small army were captive at\nAntibes, I would still move on. If every man were a prisoner in the\ncitadel, I would march on alone.' That's the man, my friends,\" cried\nEmery with ever-growing enthusiasm, \"that's our Emperor!\"\n\nAnd he cast a defiant look on Clyffurde, as much as to say: \"Bring on\nyour Wellington and your armies now! the Emperor has come back! the\nwhole of France will know how to guard him!\" Then he turned to de\nMarmont.\n\n\"And now tell me about Grenoble,\" he said.\n\n\"Grenoble had an inkling of the news already last night,\" said de\nMarmont, whose enthusiasm was no whit cooler than that of Emery.\n\"Marchand has been secretly assembling his troops, he has sent to\nChamb\u00c3\u00a9ry for the 7th and 11th regiment of the line and to Vienne for the\n4th Hussars. Inside Grenoble he has the 5th infantry regiment, the 4th\nof artillery and 3rd of engineers, with a train squadron. This morning\nhe is holding a council of war, and I know that he has been in constant\ncommunication with Mass\u00c3\u00a9na. The news is gradually filtering through into\nthe town: people stand at the street corners and whisper among\nthemselves; the word 'l'Empereur' seemed wafted upon this morning's\nbreeze. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"And by to-night we'll have the Emperor's proclamation to his people\npinned up on the walls of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville!\" exclaimed Emery, and with\nhands still trembling with excitement he gathered the precious papers\nonce more together and slipped them back into his coat pocket. Then he\nmade a visible effort to speak more quietly: \"And now,\" he said, \"for\none very important matter which, by the way, was the chief reason for my\nasking you, my good de Marmont, to meet me here before my getting to\nGrenoble.\"\n\n\"Yes? What is it?\" queried de Marmont eagerly.\n\nSurgeon-Captain Emery leaned across the table; instinctively he dropped\nhis voice, and though his excitement had not abated one jot, though his\neyes still glowed and his hands still fidgeted nervously, he had forced\nhimself at last to a semblance of calm.\n\n\"The matter is one of money,\" he said slowly. \"The Emperor has some\nfunds at his disposal, but as you know, that scurvy government of the\nRestoration never handed him over one single sou of the yearly revenue\nwhich it had solemnly agreed and sworn to pay to him with regularity.\nNow, of course,\" he continued still more emphatically, \"we who believe\nin our Emperor as we believe in God, we are absolutely convinced that\nthe army will rally round him to a man. The army loves him and has\nnever ceased to love him, the army will follow him to victory and to\ndeath. But the most loyal army in the world cannot subsist without\nmoney, and the Emperor has little or none. The news of his triumphant\nmarch across France will reach Paris long before he does, it will enable\nHis Most Excellent and Most Corpulent Majesty King Louis to skip over to\nEngland or to Ghent with everything in the treasury on which he can lay\nhis august hands. Now, de Marmont, do you perceive what the serious\nmatter is which caused me to meet you here--twenty-five kilom\u00c3\u00a8tres from\nGrenoble, where I ought to be at the present moment.\"\n\n\"Yes! I do perceive very grave trouble there,\" said de Marmont with\ncharacteristic insouciance, \"but one which need not greatly worry the\nEmperor. I am rich, thank God! and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"And may God bless you, my dear de Marmont, for the thought,\" broke in\nEmery earnestly, \"but what may be called a large private fortune is as\nnothing before the needs of an army. Soon, of course, the Emperor will\nbe in peaceful possession of his throne and will have all the resources\nof France at his command, but before that happy time arrives there will\nbe much fighting, and many days--weeks perhaps--of anxiety to go\nthrough. During those weeks the army must be paid and fed; and your\nprivate fortune, my dear de Marmont, would--even if the Emperor were to\naccept your sacrifice, which is not likely--be but as a drop in the\nmighty ocean of the cost of a campaign. What are two or even three\nmillions, my poor, dear friend? It is forty, fifty millions that the\nEmperor wants.\"\n\nDe Marmont this time had nothing to say. He was staring moodily and\nsilently before him.\n\n\"Now, that is what I have come to talk to you about,\" continued Emery\nafter a few seconds' pause, during which he had once more thrown a\nquick, half-suspicious glance on the impassive, though obviously\ninterested face of the Englishman, \"always supposing that Monsieur here\nis on our side.\"\n\n\"Neither on your side nor on the other, Captain,\" said Bobby Clyffurde\nwith a slight tone of impatience. \"I am a mere tradesman, as I have had\nthe honour to tell you: a spectator at this game of political conflicts.\nM. de Marmont knows this well, else he had not asked me to accompany him\nto-day nor offered me a mount to enable me to do so. But if you prefer\nit,\" he added lightly, \"I can go for a stroll while you discuss these\ngraver matters.\"\n\nHe would have risen from the table only that Emery immediately detained\nhim.\n\n\"No offence, Sir,\" said the surgeon-captain bluntly.\n\n\"None, I give you my word,\" assented the Englishman. \"It is only natural\nthat you should wish to discuss such grave matters in private. Let me go\nand see to our _d\u00c3\u00a9jeuner_ in the meanwhile. I feel sure that the\nfricandeau is done to a turn by now. I'll have it dished up in ten\nminutes. I pray you take no heed of me,\" he added in response to\nmurmured protestations from both de Marmont and Emery. \"I would much\nprefer to know nothing of these grave matters which you are about to\ndiscuss.\"\n\nThis time Emery did not detain him as he rose and turned to go within in\norder to find mine host or Annette. The two Frenchmen took no further\nheed of him: wrapped up in the all engrossing subject-matter they\nremained seated at the table, leaning across it, their faces close to\none another, their eyes dancing with excitement, questions and\nanswers--as soon as the stranger's back was turned--already tumbling out\nin confusion from their lips.\n\nClyffurde turned to have a last look at them before he went into the\nhouse, and while he did so his habitual, pleasant, gently-ironical smile\nstill hovered round his lips. But anon a quickly-suppressed sigh chased\nthe smile away, and over his face there crept a strange shadow--a look\nof longing and of bitter regret.\n\nIt was only for a moment, however, the next he had passed his hand\nslowly across his forehead, as if to wipe away that shadow and smooth\nout those lines of unspoken pain.\n\nSoon his cheerful voice was heard, echoing along the low rafters of the\nlittle inn, loudly calling for Annette and for news of the baked\nomelette and the fricandeau.\n\n\nV\n\n\"You really could have talked quite freely before Mr. Clyffurde, my good\nEmery,\" said de Marmont as soon as Bobby had disappeared inside the inn.\n\"He really takes no part in politics. He is a friend alike of the Comte\nde Cambray and of glovemaker Dumoulin. He has visited our Bonapartist\nClub. Dumoulin has vouched for him. You see, he is not a fighting man.\"\n\n\"I suppose that you are equally sure that he is not an English spy,\"\nremarked Emery drily.\n\n\"Of course I am sure,\" asserted de Marmont emphatically. \"Dumoulin has\nknown him for years in business, though this is the first time that\nClyffurde has visited Grenoble. He is in the glove trade in England: his\ninterests are purely commercial. He came here with introductions to the\nComte de Cambray from a mutual friend in England who seems to be a\npersonage of vast importance in his own country and greatly esteemed by\nthe Comte--else you may be sure that that stiff-necked aristocrat would\nnever have received a tradesman as a guest in his house. But it was in\nDumoulin's house that I first met Bobby Clyffurde. We took a liking to\none another, and since then have ridden a great deal together. He is a\nsplendid horseman, and I was very glad to be able to offer him a mount\nat different times. But our political conversations have never been\nvery heated or very serious. Clyffurde maintains a detached impersonal\nattitude both to the Bonapartist and the royalist cause. I asked him to\naccompany me this morning and he gladly consented, for he dearly loves a\nhorse. I assure you, you might have said anything before him.\"\n\n\"_Eh bien!_ I'm sorry if I've been obstinate and ungracious,\" said the\nsurgeon-captain, but in a tone that obviously belied his words, \"though,\nfrankly, I am very glad that we are alone for the moment.\"\n\nHe paused, and with a wave of his thick, short-fingered hand he\ndismissed this less important subject-matter and once more spoke with\nhis wonted eagerness on that which lay nearest his heart.\n\n\"Now listen, my good de Marmont,\" he said, \"do you recollect last April\nwhen the Empress--poor wretched, misguided woman--fled so precipitately\nfrom Paris, abandoning the capital, France and her crown at one and the\nsame time, and taking away with her all the Crown diamonds and money and\ntreasure belonging to the Emperor? She was terribly ill-advised, of\ncourse, but .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember all that perfectly well,\" broke in de Marmont\nimpatiently.\n\n\"Well, then, you know that that abominable Talleyrand sent one of his\nemissaries after the Empress and her suite .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. that this\nemissary--Dudon was his name--reached Orleans just before Marie Louise\nherself got there. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"And that he ordered, in Talleyrand's name, the seizure of the Empress'\nconvoy as soon as it arrived in the city,\" broke in de Marmont again.\n\"Yes. I recollect that abominable outrage perfectly. Dudon, backed by\nthe officers of the gendarmerie, managed to rob the Empress of\neverything she had, even to the last knife and fork, even to the last\npocket handkerchief belonging to the Emperor and marked with his\ninitials. Oh! it was monstrous! hellish! devilish! It makes my blood\nboil whenever I think of it .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. whenever I think of those fatuous,\ntreacherous Bourbons gloating over those treasures at the Tuileries,\nwhile our Empress went her way as effectually despoiled as if she had\nbeen waylaid by so many brigands on a public highway.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" resumed Emery quietly after de Marmont's violent storm of\nwrath had subsided. \"But I don't know if you also recollect that when\nthe various cases containing the Emperor's belongings were opened at the\nTuileries, there was just as much disappointment as gloating. Some of\nthose fatuous Bourbons--as you so rightly call them--expected to find\nsome forty or fifty millions of the Emperor's personal savings\nthere--bank-notes and drafts on the banks of France, of England and of\nAmsterdam, which they were looking forward to distributing among\nthemselves and their friends. Your friend the Comte de Cambray would no\ndoubt have come in too for his share in this distribution. But M. de\nTalleyrand is a very wise man! always far-seeing, he knows the\nimprovidence, the prodigality, the ostentation of these new masters whom\nhe is so ready to serve. Ere Dudon reached Paris with his booty, M. de\nTalleyrand had very carefully eliminated therefrom some five and twenty\nmillion francs in bank-notes and bankers' drafts, which he felt would\ncome in very usefully once for a rainy day.\"\n\n\"But M. de Talleyrand is immensely rich himself,\" protested de Marmont.\n\n\"Ah! he did not eliminate those five and twenty millions for his own\nbenefit,\" said Emery. \"I would not so boldly accuse him of theft. The\nmoney has been carefully put away by M. de Talleyrand for the use of His\nCorpulent Majesty Louis de Bourbon, XVIIIth of that name.\"\n\nThen as Emery here made a dramatic pause and looked triumphantly across\nat his companion, de Marmont rejoined somewhat bewildered:\n\n\"But .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I don't understand .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Why I am telling you this?\" retorted Emery, still with that triumphant\nair. \"You shall understand in a moment, my friend, when I tell you that\nthose five and twenty millions were never taken north to Paris, they\nwere conveyed in strict secrecy south to Grenoble!\"\n\n\"To Grenoble?\" exclaimed de Marmont.\n\n\"To Grenoble,\" reasserted Emery.\n\n\"But why? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. why such a long way?--why Grenoble?\" queried the young\nman in obvious puzzlement.\n\n\"For several reasons,\" replied Emery. \"Firstly both the pr\u00c3\u00a9fet of the\ndepartment and the military commandant are hot royalists, whilst the\nprovince of Dauphin\u00c3\u00a9 is not. In case of any army corps being sent down\nthere to quell possible and probable revolt, the money would have been\nthere to hand: also, if you remember, there was talk at the time of the\nKing of Naples proving troublesome. There, too, in case of a campaign on\nthe frontier, the money lying ready to hand at Grenoble could prove very\nuseful. But of course I cannot possibly pretend to give you all the\nreasons which actuated M. de Talleyrand when he caused five and twenty\nmillions of stolen money to be conveyed secretly to Grenoble rather than\nto Paris. His ways are more tortuous than any mere army-surgeon can\npossibly hope to gauge. Enough that he did it and that at this very\nmoment there are five and twenty millions which are the rightful\nproperty of the Emperor locked up in the cellars of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville\nat Grenoble.\"\n\n\"But .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" murmured de Marmont, who still seemed very bewildered at all\nthat he had heard, \"are you sure?\"\n\n\"Quite sure,\" affirmed Emery emphatically. \"Dumoulin brought news of it\nto the Emperor at Elba several months ago, and you know that he and his\nBonapartist Club always have plenty of spies in and around the\npr\u00c3\u00a9fecture. The money is there,\" he reiterated with still greater\nemphasis, \"now the question is how are we going to get hold of it.\"\n\n\"Easily,\" rejoined de Marmont with his habitual enthusiasm, \"when the\nEmperor marches into Grenoble and the whole of the garrison rallies\naround him, he can go straight to the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville and take everything\nthat he wants.\"\n\n\"Always supposing that M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet does not anticipate the Emperor's\ncoming by conveying the money to Paris or elsewhere before we can get\nhold of it,\" quoth Emery drily.\n\n\"Oh! Fourier is not sufficiently astute for that.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not. But we must not neglect possibilities. That money would be\na perfect godsend to the Emperor. It was originally his too, _par Dieu!_\nAnyhow, my good de Marmont, that is what I wanted to talk over quietly\nwith you before I get into Grenoble. Can you think of any means of\ngetting hold of that money in case Fourier has the notion of conveying\nit to some other place of safety?\"\n\n\"I would like to think that over, Emery,\" said de Marmont thoughtfully.\n\"As you say, we of the Bonapartist Club at Grenoble have spies inside\nthe H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville. We must try and find out what Fourier means to do as\nsoon as he realises that the Emperor is marching on Grenoble: and then\nwe must act accordingly and trust to luck and good fortune.\"\n\n\"And to the Emperor's star,\" rejoined Emery earnestly; \"it is once more\nin the ascendant. But the matter of the money is a serious one, de\nMarmont. You will deal with it seriously?\"\n\n\"Seriously!\" ejaculated de Marmont.\n\nOnce more the unquenchable fire of undying devotion to his hero glowed\nin the young man's eyes.\n\n\"Everything pertaining to the Emperor,\" he said fervently, \"is serious\nto me. For a whim of his I would lay down my life. I will think of all\nyou have told me, Emery, and here, beneath the blue dome of God's sky,\nI swear that I will get the Emperor the money that he wants or lose mine\nhonour and my life in the attempt.\n\n\"Amen to that,\" rejoined Emery with a deep sigh of satisfaction. \"You\nare a brave man, de Marmont, would to heaven every Frenchman was like\nyou. And now,\" he added with sudden transition to a lighter mood, \"let\nAnnette dish up the fricandeau. Here's our friend the tradesman, who was\nborn to be a soldier. M. Clyffurde,\" he added loudly, calling to the\nEnglishman who had just appeared in the doorway of the inn, \"my grateful\nthanks to you--not only for your courtesy, but for expediting that\ndelicious _d\u00c3\u00a9jeuner_ which tickles my appetite so pleasantly. I pray you\nsit down without delay. I shall have to make an early start after the\nmeal, as I must be inside Grenoble before dark.\"\n\nClyffurde, good-humoured, genial, quiet as usual, quickly responded to\nthe surgeon-captain's desire. He took his seat once more at the table\nand spoke of the weather and the sunshine, the Alps and the snows the\nwhile Annette spread a cloth and laid plates and knives and forks before\nthe distinguished gentlemen.\n\n\"We all want to make an early start, eh, my dear Clyffurde?\" ejaculated\nde Marmont gaily. \"We have serious business to transact this night with\nM. le Comte de Cambray, and partake too of his gracious hospitality,\nwhat?\"\n\nEmery laughed.\n\n\"Not I forsooth,\" he said. \"M. le Comte would as soon have Satan or\nBeelzebub inside his doors. And I marvel, my good de Marmont, that you\nhave succeeded in keeping on such friendly terms with that royalist\nogre.\"\n\n\"I?\" said de Marmont, whose inward exultation radiated from his entire\npersonality, \"I, my dear Emery? Did you not know that I am that royalist\nogre's future son-in-law? _Par Dieu!_ but this is a glorious day for me\nas well as a glorious day for France! Emery, dear friend, wish me joy\nand happiness. On Tuesday I wed Mademoiselle Crystal de\nCambray--to-night we sign our marriage contract! Wish me joy, I say!\nshe's a bride well worth the winning! Napoleon sets forth to conquer a\nthrone--I to conquer love. And you, old sober-face, do not look so\nglum!\" he added, turning to Clyffurde.\n\nAnd his ringing laugh seemed to echo from end to end of the narrow\nvalley.\n\nAfter which a lighter atmosphere hung around the table outside the\n\"Auberge du Grand Dauphin.\" There was but little talk of the political\nsituation, still less of party hatred and caste prejudices. The hero's\nname was still on the lips of the two men who worshipped him, and\nClyffurde, faithful to his attitude of detachment from political\nconflicts, listened quite unmoved to the impassioned dithyrambs of his\nfriends.\n\nBut so absorbed were these two in their conversation and their joy that\nthey failed to notice that Clyffurde hardly touched the excellent\n_d\u00c3\u00a9jeuner_ set before him and left mine host's fine Burgundy almost\nuntasted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE OLD REGIME\n\n\nI\n\nOn that same day and at about the same time when Victor de Marmont and\nhis English friend first turned their horses up the bridle path and\nsighted Notre Dame de Vaulx (when, if you remember, the young Frenchman\ndrew rein and fell to apostrophising the hamlet, the day, the hour and\nthe glorious news which he was expecting to hear) at about that\nself-same hour, I say, in the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau de Brestalou, situate on the right\nbank of the Is\u00c3\u00a8re at a couple of kilom\u00c3\u00a8tres from Grenoble, the big\nfolding doors of solid mahogany which lead from the suite of vast\nreception rooms to the small boudoir beyond were thrown open and Hector\nappeared to announce that M. le Comte de Cambray would be ready to\nreceive Mme. la Duchesse in the library in a quarter of an hour.\n\nMme. la Duchesse douairi\u00c3\u00a8re d'Agen thereupon closed the gilt-edged,\nmuch-bethumbed Missal which she was reading--since this was Sunday and\nshe had been unable to attend Mass owing to that severe twinge of\nrheumatism in her right knee--and placed it upon the table close to her\nelbow; then with delicate, bemittened hand she smoothed out one unruly\ncrease in her puce silk gown and finally looked up through her round,\nbone-rimmed spectacles at the sober-visaged, majestic personage who\nstood at attention in the doorway.\n\n\"Tell M. le Comte, my good Hector,\" she said with slow deliberation,\n\"that I will be with him at the time which he has so graciously\nappointed.\"\n\nHector bowed himself out of the room with that perfect decorum which\nproclaims the well-trained domestic of an aristocratic house. As soon as\nthe tall mahogany doors were closed behind him, Mme. la Duchesse took\nher spectacles off from her high-bred nose and gave a little sniff,\nwhich caused Mademoiselle Crystal to look up from her book and mutely to\nquestion Madame with those wonderful blue eyes of hers.\n\n\"Ah \u00c3\u00a7a, my little Crystal,\" was Madame's tart response to that eloquent\nenquiry, \"does Monsieur my brother imagine himself to be a second\nBourbon king, throning it in the Tuileries and granting audiences to the\nladies of his court? or is it only for my edification that he plays this\nmagnificent game of etiquette and ceremonial and other stupid\nparaphernalia which have set me wondering since last night? M. le Comte\nwill receive Mme. la Duchesse in a quarter of an hour forsooth,\" she\nadded, mimicking Hector's pompous manner; \"_par Dieu!_ I should think\nindeed that he would receive his own sister when and where it suited her\nconvenience--not his.\"\n\nCrystal was silent for a moment or two: and in those same expressive\neyes which she kept fixed on Madame's face, the look of mute enquiry had\nbecome more insistent. It almost seemed as if she were trying to\npenetrate the underlying thoughts of the older woman, as if she tried to\nread all that there was in that kindly glance of hidden sarcasm, of\nhumour or tolerance, or of gentle contempt. Evidently what she read in\nthe wrinkled face and the twinkling eyes pleased and reassured her, for\nnow the suspicion of a smile found its way round the corners of her\nsensitive mouth.\n\nThere are some very old people living in Grenoble at the present day\nwhose mothers or fathers have told them that they remembered\nMademoiselle Crystal de Cambray quite well in the year that M. le Comte\nreturned from England and once more took possession of his ancestral\nhome on the bank of the Is\u00c3\u00a8re, which those awful Terrorists of '92 had\ntaken away from him. Louis XVIII., the Benevolent king, had promptly\nrestored the old ch\u00c3\u00a2teau to its rightful owner, when he himself, after\nyears of exile, mounted the throne of his fathers, and the usurper\nBonaparte was driven out of France by the armies of Europe allied\nagainst him, and sent to cool his ambitions in the island fastnesses of\nElba.\n\nMademoiselle de Cambray was just nineteen in that year 1814 which was so\nfull of grace for the Bourbon dynasty and all its faithful adherents,\nand in February of the following year she attained her twentieth\nbirthday. Of course you know that she was born in England, and that her\nmother was English, for had not M. le Comte been obliged to fly before\nthe fury of the Terrorists, whose dreaded Committee of Public Safety had\nalready arrested him as a \"suspect\" and condemned him to the guillotine.\nHe had contrived to escape death by what was nothing short of a miracle,\nand he had lived for twenty years in England, and there had married a\nbeautiful English girl from whom Mademoiselle Crystal had inherited the\ndeep blue eyes and brilliant skin which were the greatest charm of her\neffulgent beauty.\n\nI like to think of her just as she was on that memorable day early in\nMarch of the year 1815--just as she sat that morning on a low stool\nclose to Mme. la Duchesse's high-backed chair, and with her eyes fixed\nso enquiringly upon Madame's kind old face. Her fair hair was done up in\nthe quaint loops and curls which characterised the mode of the moment:\nshe had on a white dress cut low at the neck and had wrapped a soft\ncashmere shawl round her shoulders, for the weather was cold and there\nwas no fire in the stately open hearth.\n\nHaving presumably arrived at the happy conclusion that Madame's wrath\nwas only on the surface, Crystal now said gently:\n\n\"Father loves all this etiquette, _ma tante_; it brings back memories of\na very happy past. It is the only thing he has left now,\" she added with\na little sigh, \"the only bit out of the past which that awful revolution\ncould not take away from him. You will try to be indulgent to him, aunt\ndarling, won't you?\"\n\n\"Indulgent?\" retorted the old lady with a shrug of her shoulders, \"of\ncourse I'll be indulgent. It's no affair of mine and he does as he\npleases. But I should have thought that twenty years spent in England\nwould have taught him commonsense, and twenty years' experience in\nearning a precarious livelihood as a teacher of languages in .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Hush, aunt, for pity's sake,\" broke in Crystal hurriedly, and she put\nup her hands almost as if she wished to stop the words in the old lady's\nmouth.\n\n\"All right! all right! I won't mention it again,\" said Mme. la Duchesse\ngood-humouredly. \"I have only been in this house four and twenty hours,\nmy dear child, but I have already learned my lesson. I know that the\nmemory of the past twenty years must be blotted right out of our\nminds--out of the minds of every one of us. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Not of mine, aunt, altogether,\" murmured Crystal softly.\n\n\"No, my dear--not altogether,\" rejoined Mme. la Duchesse as she placed\none of her fine white hands on the fair head of her niece; \"your\nbeautiful mother belongs to the unforgettable memories, of those twenty\nyears. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"And not only my beautiful mother, aunt dear. There are men living in\nEngland to-day whose names must remain for ever engraved upon my\nfather's heart, as well as on mine--if we should ever forget those\nnames and neglect for one single day our prayers of gratitude for their\nwelfare and their reward, we should be the meanest and blackest of\ningrates.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Madame, \"I am glad that Monsieur my brother remembers all\nthat in the midst of his restored grandeur.\"\n\n\"Have you been wronging him in your heart all this while, _ma tante_?\"\nasked Crystal, and there was a slight tone of reproach in her voices\n\"you used not to be so cynical once upon a time.\"\n\n\"Cynical!\" exclaimed the Duchesse, \"bless the child's heart! Of course I\nam cynical--at my age what can you expect?--and what can I expect? But\nthere, don't distress yourself, I am not wronging your father--far from\nit--only this grandeur--the state dinner last night--his gracious\nmanner--all that upset me. I am not used to it, my dear, you see. Twenty\nyears in that diminutive house in Worcester have altered my tastes, I\nsee, more than they did your father's .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and these last ten months\nwhich he seems to have spent in reviving the old grandeur of his\nancestral home, I spent, remember, with the dear little Sisters of Mercy\nat Boulogne, praying amidst very humble surroundings that the future may\nnot become more unendurable than the past.\"\n\n\"But you are glad to be back at Brestalou again? and you _will_ remain\nhere with us--always?\" queried Crystal, and with tender eagerness she\nclasped the older woman's hands closely in her own.\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" replied Madame gently. \"I am glad to be back in the old\nch\u00c3\u00a2teau--my dear old home--where I was very happy and very young\nonce--oh, so very long ago! And I will remain with your father and look\nafter him all the time that his young bird is absent from the nest.\"\n\nAgain she stroked her niece's soft, wavy hair with a gesture which\napparently was habitual with her, and it seemed as if a note of sadness\nhad crept into her brisk, sharp voice. Over Crystal's cheeks a wave of\ncrimson had quickly swept at her aunt's last words: and the eyes which\nshe now raised to Madame's kindly face were full of tears.\n\n\"It seems so terribly soon now, _ma tante_,\" she said wistfully.\n\n\"Hm, yes!\" quoth Mme. la Duchesse drily, \"time has a knack now and then\nof flying faster than we wish. Well, my dear, so long as this day brings\nyou happiness, the old folk who stay at home have no right to grumble.\"\n\nThen as Crystal made no reply and held her little head resolutely away,\nMadame said more insistently:\n\n\"You are happy, Crystal, are you not?\"\n\n\"Of course I am happy, _ma tante_,\" replied Crystal quickly, \"why should\nyou ask?\"\n\nBut still she would not look straight into Madame's eyes, and the tone\nof Madame's voice sounded anything but satisfied.\n\n\"Well!\" she said, \"I ask, I suppose, because I want an answer .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. a\nsatisfactory answer.\"\n\n\"You have had it, _ma tante_, have you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear. If you are happy, I am satisfied. But last night it\nseemed to me as if your ideas of your own happiness and those of your\nfather on the same subject were somewhat at variance, eh?\"\n\n\"Oh no, _ma tante_,\" rejoined Crystal quietly, \"father and I are quite\nof one mind on that subject.\"\n\n\"But your heart is pulling a different way, is that it?\"\n\nThen as Crystal once more relapsed into silence and two hot tears\ndropped on the Duchesse's wrinkled hands, the old woman added softly:\n\n\"St. Genis, who hasn't a sou, was out of the question, I suppose.\"\n\nCrystal shook her head in silence.\n\n\"And that young de Marmont is very rich?\"\n\n\"He is his uncle's heir,\" murmured Crystal.\n\n\"And you, child, are marrying a kinsman of that abominable Duc de Raguse\nin order to regild our family escutcheon.\"\n\n\"My father wished it so very earnestly,\" rejoined Crystal, who was\nbravely swallowing her tears, \"and I could not bear to run counter to\nhis desire. The Duc de Raguse has promised father that when I am a de\nMarmont he will buy back all the forfeited Cambray estates and restore\nthem to us: Victor will be allowed to take up the name of Cambray and\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Oh!\" she exclaimed passionately, \"father has had such a\nhard life, so much sorrow, so many disappointments, and now this poverty\nis so horribly grinding. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I couldn't have the heart to disappoint\nhim in this!\"\n\n\"You are a good child, Crystal,\" said Madame gently, \"and no doubt\nVictor de Marmont will prove a good husband to you. But I wish he wasn't\na Marmont, that's all.\"\n\nBut this remark, delivered in the old lady's most uncompromising manner,\nbrought forth a hot protest from Crystal:\n\n\"Why, aunt,\" she said, \"the Duc de Raguse is the most faithful servant\nthe king could possibly wish to have. It was he and no one else who\ndelivered Paris to the allies and thus brought about the downfall of\nBonaparte, and the restoration of our dear King Louis to the throne of\nFrance.\"\n\n\"Tush, child, I know that,\" said Madame with her habitual tartness of\nspeech, \"I know it just as well as history will know it presently, and\nmethinks that history will pass on the Duc de Raguse just about the same\njudgment as I passed on him in my heart last year. God knows I hate that\nBonaparte as much as anyone, and our Bourbon kings are almost as much a\npart of my religion as is the hierarchy of saints, but a traitor like\nde Marmont I cannot stomach. What was he before Bonaparte made him a\nmarshal of France and created him Duc de Raguse?--An out-at-elbows\nragamuffin in the ranks of the republican army. To Bonaparte he owed\neverything, title, money, consideration, even the military talents which\ngave him the power to turn on the hand that had fed him. Delivered Paris\nto the allies indeed!\" continued the Duchesse with ever-increasing\nindignation and volubility, \"betrayed Bonaparte, then licked the boots\nof the Czar of Russia, of the Emperor, of King Louis, of all the deadly\nenemies of the man to whom he owed his very existence. Pouah! I hate\nBonaparte, but men like Ney and Berthier and de Marmont sicken me! Thank\nGod that even in his life-time, de Marmont, Duc de Raguse, has already\nan inkling of what posterity will say of him. Has not the French\nlanguage been enriched since the capitulation of Paris with a new word\nthat henceforth and for all times will always spell disloyalty: and\nto-day when we wish to describe a particularly loathsome type of\ntreachery, do we not already speak of a 'ragusade'?\"\n\nCrystal had listened in silence to her aunt's impassioned tirade. Now\nwhen Madame paused--presumably for want of breath--she said gently:\n\n\"That is all quite true, _ma tante_, but I am afraid that father would\nnot altogether see eye to eye with you in this. After all,\" she added\nnaively, \"a pagan may become converted to Christianity without being\ncalled a traitor to his false gods, and the Duc de Raguse may have\nlearnt to hate the idol whom he once worshipped, and for this profession\nof faith we should honour him, I think.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" grunted Madame, unconvinced, \"but we need not marry into his\nfamily.\"\n\n\"But in any case,\" retorted Crystal, \"poor Victor cannot help what his\nuncle did.\"\n\n\"No, he cannot,\" assented the Duchesse decisively, \"and he is very rich\nand he loves you, and as your husband he will own all the old Cambray\nestates which his uncle of ragusade fame will buy up for him, and\npresently your son, my darling, will be Comte de Cambray, just as if\nthat awful revolution and all that robbing and spoliation had never\nbeen. And of course everything will be for the best in the best possible\nworld, if only,\" concluded the old lady with a sigh, \"if only I thought\nthat you would be happy.\"\n\nCrystal took care not to meet Madame's kindly glance just then, for of a\nsurety the tears would have rushed in a stream to her eyes. But she\nwould not give way to any access of self-pity: she had chosen her part\nin life and this she meant to play loyally, without regret and without\nmurmur.\n\n\"But of course, _ma tante_, I shall be happy,\" she said after a while;\n\"as you say, M. de Marmont is very kind and good and I know that father\nwill be happy when Brestalou and Cambray and all the old lands are once\nmore united in his name. Then he will be able to do something really\ngreat and good for the King and for France .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and I too, perhaps.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"You, my poor darling!\" exclaimed Madame, \"what can you do, I should\nlike to know.\"\n\nA curious, dreamy look came into the girl's eyes, just as if a\nforeknowledge of the drama in which she was so soon destined to play the\nchief _r\u00c3\u00b4le_ had suddenly appeared to her through the cloudy and distant\nveils of futurity.\n\n\"I don't know, _ma tante_,\" she said slowly, \"but somehow I have always\nfelt that one day I might be called upon to do something for France.\nThere are times when that feeling becomes so strong that all thoughts of\nmyself and of my own happiness fade from my knowledge, and it seems as\nif my duty to France and to the King were more insistent than my duty to\nGod.\"\n\n\"Poor France!\" sighed Madame.\n\n\"Yes! that is just what I feel, _ma tante_. Poor France! She has\nsuffered so much more than we have, and she has regained so much less!\nEnemies still lurk around her; the prowling wolf is still at her gate:\neven the throne of her king is still insecure! Poor, poor France! our\ncountry, _ma tante_! she should be our pride, our glory, and she is weak\nand torn and beset by treachery! Oh, if only I could do something for\nFrance and for the King I would count myself the happiest woman on God's\nearth.\"\n\nNow she was a woman transformed. She seemed taller and stronger. Her\ngirlishness, too, had vanished. Her cheeks burned, her eyes glowed, her\nbreath came and went rapidly through her quivering nostrils. Mme. la\nDuchesse d'Agen looked down on her niece with naive admiration.\n\n\"_H\u00c3\u00a9_ my little Joan of Arc!\" she said merrily, \"_par Dieu_, your\neloquence, _ma mignonne_, has warmed up my old heart too. But, please\nGod, our dear old country will not have need of heroism again.\"\n\n\"I am not so sure of that, _ma tante_.\"\n\n\"You are thinking of that ugly rumour which was current in Grenoble\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"If that Corsican brigand dares to set his foot again upon this land\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" began the old lady vehemently.\n\n\"Let him come, _ma tante_,\" broke in Crystal exultantly, \"we are ready\nfor him. Let him come, and this time when God has punished him again, it\nwon't be to Elba that he will be sent to expiate his villainies!\"\n\n\"Amen to that, my child,\" concluded Madame fervently. \"And now, my dear,\ndon't let me forget the hour of my audience. Hector will be back in a\nmoment or two, and I must not lose any more time gossiping. But before I\ngo, little one, will you tell me one thing?\"\n\n\"Of course I will, _ma tante_.\"\n\n\"Quite frankly?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\n\"Well then, I want to know .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. about that English friend of yours.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Mr. Clyffurde, you mean?\" asked Crystal. \"What about him?\"\n\n\"I want to know, my dear, what I ought to make of this Mr. Clyffurde.\"\n\nCrystal laughed lightly, and looked up with astonished, inquiring,\nwide-open eyes to her aunt.\n\n\"What should you want to make of him, _ma tante_?\" she asked, wholly\nunperturbed under the scrutinising gaze of Madame.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said the Duchesse abruptly. \"I have had my answer, thank you,\ndear.\"\n\nEvidently she had no intention of satisfying the girl's obvious\ncuriosity, for she suddenly rose from her chair, gathered her lace shawl\nround her shoulders, and said with abrupt transition:\n\n\"The hour for my audience is at hand. Not one minute must I keep my\naugust brother waiting. I can hear Hector's footsteps in the corridor,\nand I will not have him see me in a fluster.\"\n\nCrystal looked as if she would have liked to question Madame a little\nmore closely about her former cryptic utterance, but there was something\nin the sarcastic twinkle of those sharp eyes which caused the young girl\nto refrain from too many questions, and--very wisely--she decided to\nhold her peace.\n\nMadame la Duchesse threw a quick glance into the gilt-framed mirror\nclose by. She smoothed a stray wisp of hair which had escaped from under\nher lace cap: she gave a tug to her fichu and a pat to her skirts. Then,\nas the folding doors were once more thrown open, and Hector--stiff,\nsolemn and pompous--appeared under the lintel, Madame threw back her\nhead in the grand manner pertaining to the old days at Versailles.\n\n\"Precede me, Hector,\" she said with consummate dignity, \"to M. le\nComte's audience chamber.\"\n\nAnd with hands folded before her, her aristocratic head very erect, her\nmouth and eyes composed to reposeful majesty, she sailed out through the\nmahogany doors in a style which no one who had never curtsied to the\nBien-aim\u00c3\u00a9 Monarque could possibly hope to imitate.\n\n\nII\n\nFor some little while after her aunt had sailed out of the room Crystal\nremained where she was sitting on the low stool beside the high-backed\nchair just vacated by the Duchess.\n\nHer eyes were still glowing with the enthusiasm which had excited the\nadmiration of the older woman a while ago, and the high colour in her\ncheeks, the tremor of her nostrils showed that that same enthusiasm\nstill kept her nerves on the quiver and caused the young, hot blood to\ncourse swiftly through her veins.\n\nBut something of the lightness of her mood had vanished, something of\nthe exultant joy of the heroine had given place to the calmer\nresignation of the potential martyr. Gradually the colour faded from her\ncheeks, the light died slowly out of her eyes, and the young fair head\nso lately tossed triumphantly in the ardour of patriotism sunk gradually\nupon the still heaving breast.\n\nCrystal was alone, and she was not ashamed to let the tears well up to\nher eyes. Despite her proud profession of faith the insistent longing\nfor happiness, which is the inalienable share of youth, knocked at the\nportals of her heart.\n\nNot even to the devoted aunt who had brought her up, who had known her\nevery childish sorrow and gleaned her every childish tear, not even to\nher would she show what it cost her to sink her individuality, her\nlongings, her hopes of happiness into that overwhelming sense of duty to\nher father's wishes and to the demands of her name, her country and her\ncaste.\n\nShe had repeated it to herself often and often that her father had\nsuffered so much for the sake of his convictions, had endured poverty\nand exile where opportunism would have dictated submission to the\nusurper Bonaparte and the acceptance of riches and honours at his hands,\nhe had remained loyal in his beliefs, steadfast to his King through\ntwenty years of misery, akin to squalor, the remembrance of which would\nfor ever darken the rest of his life, but he had endured all that\nwithout bitterness, scarcely without a murmur. And now that twenty years\nof self-abnegation were at last finding their reward, now that the King\nhad come into his own, and the King's faithful friends were being\ncompensated in accordance with the length of the King's purse, would it\nnot be arrant cowardice and disloyalty for her--an only child--to oppose\nher father's will in the ordering of her own future, to refuse the rich\nmarriage which would help to restore dignity and grandeur to the ancient\nname and to the old home?\n\nCrystal de Cambray was born in England: she had lived the whole of her\nlife in a small provincial town in this country. But she had been\nbrought up by her aunt, the Duchesse douairi\u00c3\u00a8re d'Agen, and through that\nupbringing she had been made to imbibe from her earliest childhood all\nthe principles of the old regime. These principles consisted chiefly of\nimplicit obedience by the children to the parents' decrees anent\nmarriage, of blind worship of the dignity of station, and of duty to\nname and caste, to king and country.\n\nThe thought would never have entered Crystal's head that she could have\nthe right to order her own future, or to demand from life her own\nspecial brand of happiness.\n\nNow her fate had been finally decided on by her father, and she was on\nthe point of taking--at his wish--the irrevocable step which would bind\nher for ever to a man whom she could never love. But she did not think\nof rebellion, she had no thought of grumbling at Fate or at her father:\nCrystal de Cambray had English blood in her veins, the blood that makes\nmen and women accept the inevitable with set teeth and a determination\nto do the right thing even if it hurts. Crystal, therefore, had no\nthought of rebellion; she only felt an infinity of regret for something\nsweet and intangible which she had hardly realised, hardly expected,\nwhich had been too elusive to be called hope, too remote to be termed\nhappiness. She gave herself the luxury of this short outburst of\ntears--since nobody was near and nobody could see: there was a fearful\npain in her heart while she rested her head against the cushion of the\nstiff high-backed chair and cried till it seemed that she never could\ncry again whatever sorrow life might still have in store for her.\n\nBut when that outburst of grief had subsided she dried her eyes\nresolutely, rose to her feet, arranged her hair in front of the mirror,\nand feeling that her eyes were hot and her head heavy, she turned to the\ntall French window, opened it and stepped out into the garden.\n\n\nIt had suffered from years of neglect, the shrubs grew rank and stalky,\nthe paths were covered with weeds, but there was a slight feeling of\nspring in the air, the bare branches of the trees seemed swollen with\nthe rising sap, and upon the edge of the terrace balustrade a\nred-breasted robin cocked its mischievous little eye upon her.\n\nAt the bottom of the garden there was a fine row of ilex, with here and\nthere a stone seat, and in the centre an old stone fountain moss-covered\nand overshadowed by the hanging boughs of the huge, melancholy trees.\nCrystal was very fond of this avenue; she liked to sit and watch the\nplay of sunshine upon the stone of the fountain: the melancholy quietude\nof the place suited her present mood. It was so strange to look on these\nbig evergreen trees and on the havoc caused by weeds and weather on the\nfine carving of the fountain, and to think of their going on here year\nafter year for the past twenty years, while that hideous revolution had\ndevastated the whole country, while men had murdered each other,\nslaughtered women and children and committed every crime and every\ninfamy which lust of hate and revenge can engender in the hearts of men.\nThe old trees and the stone fountain had remained peaceful and still the\nwhile, unscathed and undefiled, grand, dignified and majestic, while the\nowner of the fine ch\u00c3\u00a2teau of the gardens and the fountain and of half\nthe province around earned a precarious livelihood in a foreign land,\nhalf-starved in wretchedness and exile.\n\nShe, Crystal, had never seen them until some ten months ago, when her\nfather came back into his own, and leading his daughter by the hand, had\ntaken her on a tour of inspection to show her the magnificence of her\nancestral home. She had loved at once the fine old ch\u00c3\u00a2teau with its\nlichen-covered walls, its fine portcullis and crenelated towers, she had\nwept over the torn tapestries, the broken furniture, the family\nportraits which a rough and impious rabble had wilfully damaged, she had\nloved the wide sweep of the terrace walls, the views over the Is\u00c3\u00a8re and\nacross the mountain range to the peaks of the Grande Chartreuse, but\nabove all she had loved this sombre row of ilex trees, the broken\nfountain, the hush and peace which always lay over this secluded portion\nof the neglected garden.\n\nThe earth was moist and soft under her feet, the cheeky robin, curious\nafter the manner of his kind, had followed her and was flying from seat\nto seat ahead of her watching her every movement.\n\n\"Crystal!\"\n\nAt first she thought that it was the wind sighing through the trees, so\nsoftly had her name been spoken, so like a sigh did it seem as it\nreached her ears.\n\n\"Crystal!\"\n\nThis time she could not be mistaken, someone had called her name,\nsomeone was walking up the avenue rapidly, behind her. She would not\nturn round, for she knew who it was that had called and she would not\nallow surprise to resuscitate the outward signs of regret. But she stood\nquite still while those hasty footsteps drew nearer, and she made a\ngreat and successful effort to keep back the tears which once more\nthreatened to fill her eyes.\n\nA minute later she felt herself gently drawn to the nearest stone seat,\nand she sank down upon it, still trying very hard to remain calm and\nabove all not to cry.\n\n\"Oh! why, why did you come, Maurice?\" she said at last, when she felt\nthat she could look with some semblance of composure on the\nhalf-sitting, half-kneeling figure of the young man beside her. Despite\nher obstinate resistance he had taken her hand in his and was covering\nit with kisses.\n\n\"Why did you come,\" she reiterated pleadingly, \"you must know that it is\nno use. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"I can't believe it. I won't believe it,\" he protested passionately.\n\"Crystal, if you really cared you would not send me away from you.\"\n\n\"If I really cared?\" she said dully. \"Maurice, sometimes I think that if\n_you_ really cared you would not make it so difficult for me. Can't you\nsee,\" she added more vehemently, \"that every time you come you make me\nmore wretched, and my duty seem more hard? till sometimes I feel as if I\ncould not bear it any longer--as if in the struggle my poor heart would\nsuddenly break.\"\n\n\"And because your father is so heartless .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" he began vehemently.\n\n\"My father is not heartless, Maurice,\" she broke in firmly, \"but you\nmust try and see for yourself how impossible it was for him to give his\nconsent to our marriage even if he knew that my happiness was bounded by\nyour love. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Just think it over quietly--if you had a sister who was\nall the world to you, would _you_ consent to such a marriage? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"With a penniless, out-at-elbows, good-for-nothing, you mean?\" he said,\nwith a kind of resentful bitterness. \"No! I dare say I should not.\nMoney!\" he cried impetuously as he jumped to his feet, and burying his\nhands in the pockets of his breeches he began pacing the path up and\ndown in front of her. \"Money! always money! Always talk of duty and of\nobedience .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. always your father and his sorrows and his desires .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\ndo I count for nothing, then? Have I not suffered as he has suffered?\ndid I not live in exile as he did? Have I not made sacrifices for my\nking and for my ideals? Why should I suffer in the future as well as in\nthe past? Why, because my king is powerless or supine in giving me back\nwhat was filched from my father, should that be taken from me which\nalone gives me incentive to live .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you, Crystal,\" he added as once\nagain he knelt beside her. He encircled her shoulders with his arms,\nthen he seized her two hands and covered them with kisses. \"You are all\nthat I want in this world. After all, we can live in poverty .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. we\nhave been brought up in poverty, you and I .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and even then it is\nonly a question of a few years .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. months, perhaps .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. the King must\ngive us back what that abominable Revolution took from us--from us who\nremained loyal to him and because we were loyal.

Tears of passion and of fervour came to his\neyes and he buried his head in the folds of Crystal's white gown and\nheavy sobs shook his bent shoulders. She, moved by that motherly\ntenderness which is seldom absent from a good woman's love, stroked with\nsoothing fingers the matted hair from his hot forehead. For a while she\nremained silent while the paroxysm of his passionate revolt spent itself\nin tears, then she said quite softly:\n\n\"I think, Maurice, that in your heart you do us all an injustice--to me,\nto father, to yourself, even to the King. The King cannot give you that\nwhich is not his; your property--like ours--was confiscated by that\nawful revolutionary government because your father and mine followed\ntheir king into exile. The rich lands were sold for the benefit of the\nnation: the nation presumably has spent the money, but the people who\nbought the lands in good faith cannot be dispossessed by our King\nwithout creating bitter ill-feeling against himself, as you well know,\nand once more endangering his throne. Those are the facts, Maurice,\nagainst which no hot-blooded argument, no passionate outbursts can\nprevail. The King gave my father back this dear old castle, because it\nhappened to have proved unsaleable, and was still on the nation's hands.\nOur rich lands--like yours--can never be restored to us: that hard fact\nhas been driven into poor father's head for the past ten months, and now\nit has gone home at last. These grey walls, this neglected garden, a few\nsticks of broken furniture, a handful of money from an over-generous\nking's treasury is all that Fate has rescued for him from out the ashes\nof the past. My father is every whit as penniless as you are yourself,\nMaurice, as penniless as ever he was in England, when he gave French and\ndrawing lessons to a lot of young ragamuffins in a middle-class school.\nBut Victor de Marmont is rich, and his money--once I am his wife--will\npurchase back all the estates which have been in our family for\nhundreds of years. For my father's sake, for the sake of the name which\nI bear, I must give my hand to Victor de Marmont, and pray to God that\nsome semblance of peace, the sense of duty accomplished, will compensate\nme for the happiness to which I shall bid good-bye to-day.\"\n\n\"And you are willing to be sold to young de Marmont for the price of a\nfew acres of land!\" retorted Maurice de St. Genis hotly. \"Oh! it's\nmonstrous, Crystal, monstrous! All the more monstrous as you seem quite\nunconscious of the iniquity of such a bargain.\"\n\n\"Women of our caste, Maurice,\" she said in her turn with a touch of\nbitterness, \"have often before now been sacrificed for the honour of\ntheir name. Men have been accustomed to look to them for help when their\nown means of gilding their escutcheons have failed.\"\n\n\"And you are willing, Crystal, to be sold like this?\" he insisted.\n\n\"My father wishes me to marry Victor de Marmont,\" she replied with calm\ndignity, \"and after all that he has suffered for the honour and dignity\nof our name, I should deem myself craven and treacherous if I refused to\nobey him in this.\"\n\nMaurice de St. Genis once more rose to his feet. All his vehemence, his\nriotous outbreak of rebellion seemed to have been smothered beneath a\npall of dreary despair. His young, good-looking face appeared sombre and\nsullen, his restless, dark eyes wandered obstinately from Crystal's fair\nbent head to her stooping shoulders, to her hands, to her feet. It\nseemed as if he was trying to engrave an image of her upon his turbulent\nbrain, or that he wished to force her to look on him again before she\nspoke the last words of farewell.\n\nBut she wouldn't look at him. She kept her head resolutely averted,\nlooking far out over the undulating lands of Dauphin\u00c3\u00a9 and Savoie to\nwhere in the far distant sky the stately Alps reared their snow-crowned\nheads. At last, unable to bear her silence any longer, he said dully:\n\n\"Then it is your last word, Crystal?\"\n\n\"You know that it must be, Maurice,\" she murmured in reply. \"My marriage\ncontract will be signed to-night, and on Tuesday I go to the altar with\nVictor de Marmont.\"\n\n\"And you mean to tear your love for me out of your heart?\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"Were its roots a little deeper, a little stronger, you could not do it,\nCrystal. But they are not so deep as those of your love for your\nfather.\"\n\nShe made no reply .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. perhaps something in her heart told her that\nafter all he might be right, that, unbeknown to herself even, there were\ntendrils of affection in her that bound her, ivylike, and so closely--to\nher father that even her girlish love for Maurice de St. Genis--the\nfirst hint of passion that had stirred the smooth depths of her young\nheart--could not tear her from that bulwark to which she clung.\n\n\"This is the last time that I shall see you, Crystal,\" said Maurice with\na sigh, seeing that obviously she meant to allow his taunt to pass\nunchallenged.\n\n\"You are going away?\" she asked.\n\n\"How can I stay--here, under this roof, where anon--in a few\nhours--Victor de Marmont will have claims upon you which, if he\nexercised them before me would make me wish to kill him or myself. I\nshall leave to-morrow--early .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" he added more quietly.\n\n\"Where will you go?\"\n\n\"To Paris--or abroad--or the devil, I don't know which,\" he replied\nmoodily.\n\n\"Father will be sorry if you go?\" she murmured under her breath, for\nonce again the tears were very insistent, and she felt an awful pain in\nher heart, because of the misery which she had to inflict upon him.\n\n\"Your father has been passing kind to me. He gave me a home when I was\nhomeless, but it is not fitting that I should trespass any longer upon\nhis hospitality.\"\n\n\"Have you made any plans?\"\n\n\"Not yet. But the King will give me a commission. There will be some\nfighting now .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. there was a rumour in Grenoble last night that\nBonaparte had landed at Antibes, and was marching on Paris.\"\n\n\"A false rumour as usual, I suppose,\" she said indifferently.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" he replied.\n\nThere was silence between them for awhile after that, silence only\nbroken by the twitter of birds wakening to the call of spring. The word\n\"good-bye\" remained unspoken: neither of them dared to say it lest it\nbroke the barrier of their resolve.\n\n\"Will you not go now, Maurice?\" said Crystal at last in pitiable\npleading, \"we only make each other hopelessly wretched, by lingering\nnear one another after this.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will go, Crystal,\" he replied, and this time he really forced\nhis voice to tones of gentleness, although his inward resentment still\nbubbled out with every word he spoke, \"I wish I could have left this\nhouse altogether--now--at once--but your father would resent it--and he\nhas been so kind .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I wish I could go to-day,\" he reiterated\nobstinately, \"I dread seeing Victor de Marmont in this house, where the\nlaws of chivalry forbid my striking him in the face.\"\n\n\"Maurice!\" she exclaimed reproachfully.\n\n\"Nay! I'll not say it again: I have sufficient reason left in me, I\nthink, to show these parvenus how we, of the old regime, bear every blow\nwhich fate chooses to deal to us. They have taken everything from us,\nthese new men--our lives, our lands, our very means of subsistence--now\nthey have taken to filching our sweethearts--curse them! but at least\nlet us keep our dignity!\"\n\nBut again she was silent. What was there to say that had not been\nsaid?--save that unspoken word \"good-bye.\" And he asked very softly:\n\n\"May I kiss you for the last time, Crystal?\"\n\n\"No, Maurice,\" she replied, \"never again.\"\n\n\"You are still free,\" he urged. \"You are not plighted to de Marmont\nyet.\"\n\n\"No--not actually--not till to-night. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Then .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. mayn't I?\"\n\n\"No, Maurice,\" she said decisively.\n\n\"Your hand then?\"\n\n\"If you like.\" He knelt down close to her; she yielded her hand to him\nand he with his usual impulsiveness covered it with kisses into which he\ntried to infuse the fervour of a last farewell.\n\nThen without another word he rose to his feet and walked away with a\nlong and firm stride down the avenue. Crystal watched his retreating\nfigure until the overhanging branches of the ilex hid him from her view.\n\nShe made no attempt now to restrain her tears, they flowed\nuninterruptedly down her cheeks and dropped hot and searing upon her\nhands. With Maurice's figure disappearing down the dark avenue, with the\necho of his footsteps dying away in the distance, the last chapter of\nher first book of romance seemed to be closing with relentless finality.\n\nThe afternoon sun was hidden behind a bank of grey clouds, the northeast\nwind came whistling insistently through the trees:--even that feeling of\nspring in the air had vanished. It was just a bleak grey winter's day\nnow. Crystal felt herself shivering with cold. She drew her shawl more\nclosely round her shoulders, then with eyes still wet with tears, but\nsmall head held well erect, she rose to her feet and walked rapidly back\nto the house.\n\n\nIII\n\nMadame la Duchesse had in the meanwhile followed Hector along the\ncorridor and down the finely carved marble staircase. At a monumental\ndoor on the ground floor the man paused, his hand upon the massive\normolu handle, waiting for Madame la Duchesse to come up.\n\nHe felt a little uncomfortable at her approach for here in the big\nsquare hall the light was very clear, and he could see Madame's keen,\nsearching eyes looking him up and down and through and through. She even\nput up her lorgnon and though she was not very tall, she contrived to\nlook Hector through them straight between the eyes.\n\n\"Is M. le Comte in there?\" Madame la Duchesse deigned to ask as she\npointed with her lorgnon to the door.\n\n\"In the small library beyond, Madame la Duchesse,\" replied Hector\nstiffly.\n\n\"And .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" she queried with sharp sarcasm, \"is the antechamber very\nfull of courtiers and ladies just now?\"\n\nA quick, almost imperceptible blush spread over Hector's impassive\ncountenance, and as quickly vanished again.\n\n\"M. le Comte,\" he said imperturbably, \"is disengaged at the present\nmoment. He seldom receives visitors at this hour.\"\n\nOn Madame's mobile lips the sarcastic curl became more marked. \"And I\nsuppose, my good Hector,\" she said, \"that since M. le Comte has only\ngranted an audience to his sister to-day, you thought it was a good\nopportunity for putting yourself at your ease and wearing your patched\nand mended clothes, eh?\"\n\nOnce more that sudden wave of colour swept over Hector's solemn old\nface. He was evidently at a loss how to take Mme. la Duchesse's\nremark--whether as a rebuke or merely as one of those mild jokes of\nwhich every one knew that Madame was inordinately fond.\n\nSomething of his dignity of attitude seemed to fall away from him as he\nvainly tried to solve this portentous problem. His mouth felt dry and\nhis head hot, and he did not know on which foot he could stand with the\nleast possible discomfort, and how he could contrive to hide from Madame\nla Duchesse's piercing eyes that very obvious patch in the right knee of\nhis breeches.\n\n\"Madame la Duchesse will forgive me, I hope,\" he stammered painfully.\n\nBut already Madame's kind old face had shed its mask of raillery.\n\n\"Never mind, Hector,\" she said gently, \"you are a good fellow, and\nthere's no occasion to tell me lies about the rich liveries which are\nput away somewhere, nor about the numerous retinue and countless number\nof flunkeys, all of whom are having unaccountably long holidays just\nnow. It's no use trying to throw dust in my eyes, my poor friend, or put\non that pompous manner with me. I know that the carpets are not all\ntemporarily rolled up or the best of the furniture at a repairer's in\nGrenoble--what's the use of pretending with me, old Hector? Those days\nat Worcester are not so distant yet, are they? when all the family had\nto make a meal off a pound of sausages, or your wife Jeanne, God bless\nher! had to pawn her wedding-ring to buy M. le Comte de Cambray a\nsecond-hand overcoat.\"\n\n\"Madame la Duchesse, I humbly pray your Grace .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" entreated Hector\nwhose wrinkled, parchment-like face had become the colour of a peony,\nand who, torn between the respect which he had for the great lady and\nhis horror at what she said was ready to sink through the floor in his\nconfusion.\n\n\"Eh what, man?\" retorted the Duchesse lightly, \"there is no one but\nthese bare walls to hear me; and my words, you'll find, will clear the\natmosphere round you--it was very stifling, my good Hector, when I\narrived. There now!\" she added, \"announce me to M. le Comte and then go\ndown to Jeanne and tell her that I for one have no intention of\nforgetting Worcester, or the pawned ring, or the sausages, and that the\narray of Grenoble louts dressed up for the occasion in moth-eaten\nliveries dragged up out of some old chests do not please me half as much\nround a dinner table as did her dear old, streaming face when she used\nto bring us the omelette straight out of the kitchen.\"\n\nShe dropped her lorgnon, and folding her aristocratic hands upon her\nbosom, she once more assumed the grand manner pertaining to Versailles,\nand Hector having swallowed an uncomfortable lump in his throat, threw\nopen the huge, folding doors and announced in a stentorian voice:\n\n\"Madame la Duchesse douairi\u00c3\u00a8re d'Agen!\"\n\n\nIV\n\nM. le Comte de Cambray was at this time close on sixty years of age, and\nthe hardships which he had endured for close upon a quarter of a century\nhad left their indelible impress upon his wrinkled, careworn face.\n\nBut no one--least of all a younger man--could possibly rival him in\ndignity of bearing and gracious condescension of manner. He wore his\nclothes after the old-time fashion, and clung to the powdered peruque\nwhich had been the mode at the Tuileries and Versailles before these\nvulgar young republicans took to wearing their own hair in its natural\ncolour.\n\nNow as he advanced from the inner room to meet Mme. la Duchesse, he\nseemed a perfect presentation or rather resuscitation of the courtly and\nvanished epoch of the Roi Soleil. He held himself very erect and walked\nwith measured step, and a stereotyped smile upon his lips. He paused\njust in front of Mme. la Duchesse, then stopped and lightly touched with\nhis lips the hand which she held out to him.\n\n\"Tell me, Monsieur my brother,\" said Madame in her loudly-pitched voice,\n\"do you expect me to make before you my best Versailles curtsey,\nfor--with my rheumatic knee--I warn you that once I get down, you might\nfind it very difficult to get me up on my feet again.\"\n\n\"Hush, Sophie,\" admonished M. le Comte impatiently, \"you must try and\nsubdue your voice a little, we are no longer in Worcester remember--\"\n\nBut Madame only shrugged her thin shoulders.\n\n\"Bah!\" she retorted, \"there's only good old Hector on the other side of\nthe door, and you don't imagine you are really throwing dust in _his_\neyes do you? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. good old Hector with his threadbare livery and his\nill-fed belly. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Sophie!\" exclaimed M. le Comte who was really vexed this time, \"I must\ninsist. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"All right, all right my dear Andr\u00c3\u00a9. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I won't say anything more.\nTake me to your audience chamber and I'll try to behave like a lady.\"\n\nA smile that was distinctly mischievous still hovered round Madame's\nlips, but she forced her eyes to look grave: she held out the tips of\nher fingers to her brother and allowed him to lead her in the correct\nmanner into the next room.\n\nHere M. le Comte invited her to sit in an upright chair which was placed\nat a convenient angle close to his bureau while he himself sat upon a\nstately throne-like armchair, one shapely knee bent, the other slightly\nstretched forward, displaying the fine silk stocking and the set of his\nwell-cut, satin breeches. Mme. la Duchesse kept her hands folded in\nfront of her, and waited in silence for her brother to speak, but he\nseemed at a loss how to begin, for her piercing gaze was making him\nfeel very uncomfortable: he could not help but detect in it the twinkle\nof good-humoured sarcasm.\n\nMadame of course would not help him out. She enjoyed his obvious\nembarrassment, which took him down somewhat from that high altitude of\ndignity wherein he delighted to soar.\n\n\"My dear Sophie,\" he began at last, speaking very deliberately and\ncarefully choosing his words, \"before the step which Crystal is about to\ntake to-day becomes absolutely irrevocable, I desired to talk the matter\nover with you, since it concerns the happiness of my only child.\"\n\n\"Isn't it a little late, my good Andr\u00c3\u00a9,\" remarked Madame drily, \"to talk\nover a question which has been decided a month ago? The contract is to\nbe signed to-night. Our present conversation might have been held to\nsome purpose soon after the New Year. It is distinctly useless to-day.\"\n\nAt Madame's sharp and uncompromising words a quick blush had spread over\nthe Comte's sunken cheeks.\n\n\"I could not consult you before, Sophie,\" he said coldly, \"you chose to\nimmure yourself in a convent, rather than come back straightaway to your\nold home as we all did when our King was restored to his throne. The\npost has been very disorganised and Boulogne is a far cry from\nBrestalou, but I did write to you as soon as Victor de Marmont made his\nformal request for Crystal's hand. To this letter I had no reply, and I\ncould not keep him waiting in indefinite uncertainty.\"\n\n\"Your letter did not reach me until a month after it was written, as I\nhad the honour to tell you in my reply.\"\n\n\"And that same reply only reached me a fortnight ago,\" retorted the\nComte, \"when Crystal had been formally engaged to Victor de Marmont for\nover a month and the date for the signature of the contract and the\nwedding-day had both been fixed. I then sent a courier at great expense\nand in great haste immediately to you,\" he added with a tone of\ndignified reproach, \"I could do no more.\"\n\n\"Or less,\" she assented tartly. \"And here I am, my dear brother, and I\nam not blaming you for delays in the post. I merely remarked that it was\ntoo late now to consult me upon a marriage which is to all intents and\npurposes, an accomplished fact already.\"\n\n\"That is so of course. But it would be a great personal satisfaction to\nme, my good Sophie, to hear your views upon the matter. You have brought\nCrystal up from babyhood: in a measure, you know her better than even\nI--her father--do and therefore you are better able than I am to judge\nwhether Crystal's marriage with de Marmont will be conducive to her\npermanent happiness.\"\n\n\"As to that, my good Andr\u00c3\u00a9,\" quoth Madame, \"you must remember that when\nour father and mother decided that a marriage between me and M. le Duc\nd'Agen was desirable, my personal feelings and character were never\nconsulted for a moment .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and I suppose that--taking life as it is--I\nwas never particularly unhappy as his wife.\"\n\n\"And what do you adduce from those reminiscences, my dear Sophie?\"\nqueried the Comte de Cambray suavely.\n\n\"That Victor de Marmont is not a bad fellow,\" replied Madame, \"that he\nis no worse than was M. le Duc d'Agen and that therefore there is no\nreason to suppose that Crystal will be any more unhappy than I was in my\ntime.\"\n\n\"But .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"There is no 'but' about it, my good Andr\u00c3\u00a9. Crystal is a sweet girl and\na devoted daughter. She will make the best, never you fear! of the\ncircumstances into which your blind worship of your own dignity and of\nyour rank have placed her.\"\n\n\"My good Sophie,\" broke in the Count hotly, \"you talk _par Dieu_, as if\nI was forcing my only child into a distasteful marriage.\"\n\n\"No, I do not talk as if you were forcing Crystal into a distasteful\nmarriage, but you know quite well that she only accepted Victor de\nMarmont because it was your wish, and because his millions are going to\nbuy back the old Cambray estates, and she is so imbued with the sense of\nher duty to you and to the family escutcheon, that she was willing to\nsacrifice every personal feeling in the fulfilment of that duty.\"\n\n\"By 'personal feeling' I suppose that you mean St. Genis.\"\n\n\"Well, yes .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I do,\" said Madame laconically.\n\n\"Crystal was very much in love with him at one time.\"\n\n\"She still is.\"\n\n\"But even you, my dear sister, must admit that a marriage with St. Genis\nwas out of the question,\" retorted the Count in his turn with some\nacerbity. \"I am very fond of Maurice and his name is as old and great as\nours, but he hasn't a sou, and you know as well as I do by now that the\nrestoration of confiscated lands is out of the question .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. parliament\nwill never allow it and the King will never dare. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"I know all that, my poor Andr\u00c3\u00a9,\" sighed Madame in a more conciliatory\nspirit, \"I know moreover that you yourself haven't a sou either, in\nspite of your grandeur and your prejudices. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Money must be got\nsomehow, and our ancient family 'scutcheon must be regilt at any cost. I\nknow that we must keep up this state pertaining to the old regime, we\nmust have our lacqueys and our liveries, sycophants around us and gaping\nyokels on our way when we sally out into the open. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. We must blot\nout from our lives those twenty years spent in a democratic and\nenlightened country where no one is ashamed either of poverty or of\nhonest work--and above all things we must forget that there has ever\nbeen a revolution which sent M. le Comte de Cambray, Commander of the\nOrder of the Holy Ghost, Grand Cross of the Ordre du Lys, Seigneur of\nMontfleury and St. Eynard, hereditary Grand Chamberlain of France, to\nteach French and drawing in an English Grammar School. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"You wrong me there, Sophie, I wish to forget nothing of the past twenty\nyears.\"\n\n\"I thought that you had given your memory a holiday.\"\n\n\"I forget nothing,\" he reiterated with dignified emphasis, \"neither the\nsqualid poverty which I endured, nor the bitter experiences which I\ngleaned in exile.\"\n\n\"Nor the devotion of those who saved your life.\"\n\n\"And yours .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" he interposed.\n\n\"And mine, at risk of their own.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you will believe me when I tell you that not a day goes by but\nCrystal and I speak of Sir Percy Blakeney, and of his gallant League of\nthe Scarlet Pimpernel.\"\n\n\"Well! we owe our lives to them,\" said Madame with deep-drawn sigh. \"I\nwonder if we shall ever see any of those fine fellows again!\"\n\n\"God only knows,\" sighed M. le Comte in response. \"But,\" he continued\nmore lightly, \"as you know the League itself has ceased to be. We saw\nvery little of Sir Percy and Lady Blakeney latterly for we were too poor\never to travel up to London. Crystal and I saw them, before we left\nEngland, and I then had the opportunity of thanking Sir Percy Blakeney\nfor the last time, for the many valuable French lives which his plucky\nlittle League had saved.\"\n\n\"He is indeed a gallant gentleman,\" said Mme. la Duchesse gently, even\nwhilst her bright, shrewd eyes gazed straight out before her as if on\nthe great bare walls of her own ancestral home, the ghostly hand of\nmemory had conjured up pictures of long ago:--her own, her husband's and\nher brother's arrest here in this very room, the weeping servants, the\nrough, half-naked soldiery--then the agony of a nine days' imprisonment\nin a dark, dank prison-cell filled to overflowing with poor wretches in\nthe same pitiable plight as herself--the hasty trial, the insults, the\nmockery:--her husband's death in prison and her own thoughts of\napproaching death!\n\nThen the gallant deed!--after all these years she could still see\nherself, her brother and Jeanne, her faithful maid, and poor devoted\nHector all huddled up in a rickety tumbril, being dragged through the\nstreets of Paris on the road to death. On ahead she had seen the weird\noutline of the guillotine silhouetted against the evening sky, whilst\nall around her a howling, jeering mob sang that awful refrain: \"C\u00c3\u00a0 ira!\nC\u00c3\u00a0 ira! les aristos \u00c3\u00a0 la lanterne!\"\n\nThen it was that she had felt unseen hands snatching her out of the\ntumbril, she had felt herself being dragged through that yelling crowd\nto a place where there was silence and darkness and where she knew that\nshe was safe: thence she was conveyed--she hardly realised how--to\nEngland, where she and her brother and Jeanne and Hector, their faithful\nservants, had found refuge for over twenty years.\n\n\"It was a gallant deed!\" whispered Mme. la Duchesse once again, \"and one\nwhich will always make me love every Englishman I meet, for the sake of\none who was called The Scarlet Pimpernel.\"\n\n\"Then why should you attribute vulgar ingratitude to me?\" retorted the\nComte reproachfully. \"My feelings I imagine are as sensitive as your\nown. Am I not trying my best to be kind to that Mr. Clyffurde, who is an\nhonoured guest in my house--just because it was Sir Percy Blakeney who\nrecommended him to me?\"\n\n\"It can't be very difficult to be kind to such an attractive young man,\"\nwas Mme. la Duchesse's dry comment. \"Recommendation or no recommendation\nI liked your Mr. Clyffurde and if it were not so late in the day and\nthere was still time to give my opinion, I should suggest that Mr.\nClyffurde's money could quite well regild our family 'scutcheon. He is\nvery rich too, I understand.\"\n\n\"My good Sophie!\" exclaimed the Comte in horror, \"what can you be\nthinking of?\"\n\n\"Crystal principally,\" replied the Duchesse. \"I thought Clyffurde a far\nnicer fellow than de Marmont.\"\n\n\"My dear sister,\" said the Comte stiffly, \"I really must ask you to\nthink sometimes before you speak. Of a truth you make suggestions and\ncomments at times which literally stagger one.\"\n\n\"I don't see anything so very staggering in the idea of a penniless\naristocrat marrying a wealthy English gentleman. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"A gentleman! my dear!\" exclaimed the Comte.\n\n\"Well! Mr. Clyffurde is a gentleman, isn't he?\"\n\n\"His family is irreproachable, I believe.\"\n\n\"Well then?\"\n\n\"But .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Mr. Clyffurde .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you know, my dear. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"No! I don't know,\" said Madame decisively. \"What is the matter with Mr.\nClyffurde?\"\n\n\"Well! I didn't like to tell you, Sophie, immediately on your arrival\nyesterday,\" said the Comte, who was making visible efforts to mitigate\nthe horror of what he was about to say: \"but .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. as a matter of fact\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. this Mr. Clyffurde whom you met in my house last night .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. who\nsat next to you at my table .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. with whom you had that long and\nanimated conversation afterwards .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. is nothing better than a\nshopkeeper!\"\n\nNo doubt M. le Comte de Cambray expected that at this awful\nannouncement, Mme. la Duchesse's indignation and anger would know no\nbounds. He was quite ready even now with a string of apologies which he\nwould formulate directly she allowed him to speak. He certainly felt\nvery guilty towards her for the undesirable acquaintance which she had\nmade in her brother's own house. Great was his surprise therefore when\nMadame's wrinkled face wreathed itself into a huge smile, which\npresently broadened into a merry laugh, as she threw back her head, and\nsaid still laughing:\n\n\"A shopkeeper, my dear Comte? A shopkeeper at your aristocratic table?\nand your meal did not choke you? Why! God forgive you, but I do believe\nyou are actually becoming human.\"\n\n\"I ought to have told you sooner, of course,\" began the Comte stiffly.\n\n\"Why bless your heart, I knew it soon enough.\"\n\n\"You knew it?\"\n\n\"Of course I did. Mr. Clyffurde told me that interesting fact before he\nhad finished eating his soup.\"\n\n\"Did he tell you that .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. that he traded in .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. in gloves?\"\n\n\"Well! and why not gloves?\" she retorted. \"Gloves are very nice things\nand better manufactured at Grenoble than anywhere else in the world. The\nEnglish coquettes are very wise in getting their gloves from Grenoble\nthrough the good offices of Mr. Clyffurde.\"\n\n\"But, my dear Sophie .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Mr. Clyffurde buys gloves here from Dumoulin\nand sells them again to a shop in London .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. he buys and sells other\nthings too and he does it for profit. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Of course he does. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. You don't suppose that any one would do that\nsort of thing for pleasure, do you? Mr. Clyffurde,\" continued Madame\nwith sudden seriousness, \"lost his father when he was six years old. His\nmother and four sisters had next to nothing to live on after the bulk of\nwhat they had went for the education of the boy. At eighteen he made up\nhis mind that he would provide his mother and sisters with all the\nluxuries which they had lacked for so long and instead of going into the\narmy--which had been the burning ambition of his boyhood--he went into\nbusiness .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and in less than ten years has made a fortune.\"\n\n\"You seem to have learnt a great deal of the man's family history in so\nshort a time.\"\n\n\"I liked him: and I made him talk to me about himself. It was not easy,\nfor these English men are stupidly reticent, but I dragged his story out\nof him bit by bit--or at least as much of it as I could--and I can tell\nyou, my good Andr\u00c3\u00a9, that never have I admired a man so much as I do this\nMr. Clyffurde .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. for never have I met so unselfish a one. I declare\nthat if I were only a few years younger,\" she continued whimsically,\n\"and even so .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. heigh! but I am not so old after all. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"My dear Sophie!\" ejaculated the Comte.\n\n\"Eh, what?\" she retorted tartly, \"you would object to a tradesman as a\nbrother-in-law, would you? What about a de Marmont for a son? Eh?\"\n\n\"Victor de Marmont is a soldier in the army of our legitimate King. His\nuncle the Duc de Raguse. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"That's just it,\" broke in Madame again, \"I don't like de Marmont\nbecause he is a de Marmont.\"\n\n\"Is that the only reason for your not liking him?\"\n\n\"The only one,\" she replied. \"But I must say that this Mr. Clyffurde\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"You must not harp on that string, Sophie,\" said the Comte sternly. \"It\nis too ridiculous. To begin with Clyffurde never cared for Crystal, and,\nsecondly, Crystal was already engaged to de Marmont when Clyffurde\narrived here, and, thirdly, let me tell you that my daughter has far too\nmuch pride in her ever to think of a shopkeeper in the light of a\nhusband even if he had ten times this Mr. Clyffurde's fortune.\"\n\n\"Then everything is comfortably settled, Andr\u00c3\u00a9. And now that we have\nreturned to our sheep, and have both arrived at the conclusion that\nnothing stands in the way of Crystal's marriage with Victor de Marmont,\nI suppose that I may presume that my audience is at an end.\"\n\n\"I only wished to hear your opinion, my good Sophie,\" rejoined M. le\nComte. And he rose stiffly from his chair.\n\n\"Well! and you have heard it, Andr\u00c3\u00a9,\" concluded Madame as she too rose\nand gathered her lace shawl round her shoulders. \"You may thank God, my\ndear brother, that you have in Crystal such an unselfish and obedient\nchild, and in me such a submissive sister. Frankly--since you have\nchosen to ask my opinion at this eleventh hour--I don't like this de\nMarmont marriage, though I have admitted that I see nothing against the\nyoung man himself. If Crystal is not unhappy with him, I shall be\ncontent: if she is, I will make myself exceedingly disagreeable, both to\nhim and to you, and that being my last word, I have the honour to wish\nyou a polite 'good-day.'\"\n\nShe swept her brother an imperceptibly ironical curtsey, but he detained\nher once again, as she turned to go.\n\n\"One word more, Sophie,\" he said solemnly. \"You will be amiable with\nVictor de Marmont this evening?\"\n\n\"Of course I will,\" she replied tartly. \"Ah, \u00c3\u00a7a, Monsieur my brother, do\nyou take me for a washerwoman?\"\n\n\"I am entertaining the pr\u00c3\u00a9fet for the _souper du contrat_,\" continued\nthe Comte, quietly ignoring the old lady's irascibility of temper, \"and\nthe general in command of the garrison. They are both converted\nBonapartists, remember.\"\n\n\"Hm!\" grunted Madame crossly, \"whom else are you going to entertain?\"\n\n\"Mme. Fourier, the pr\u00c3\u00a9fet's wife, and Mlle. Marchand, the general's\ndaughter, and of course the d'Embruns and the Genevois.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"Some half dozen or so notabilities of Grenoble. We shall sit down\ntwenty to supper, and afterwards I hold a reception in honour of the\ncoming marriage of Mlle. de Cambray de Brestalou with M. Victor de\nMarmont. One must do one's duty. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"And pander to one's love of playing at being a little king in a limited\nway. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. All right! I won't say anything more. I promise that I won't\ndisgrace you, and that I'll put on a grand manner that will fill those\nworthy notabilities and their wives with awe and reverence. And now, I'd\nbest go,\" she added whimsically, \"ere my good resolutions break down\nbefore your pomposity .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I suppose the louts from the village will be\nagain braced up in those moth-eaten liveries, and the bottles of thin\nM\u00c3\u00a9doc purchased surreptitiously at a local grocer's will be duly\nsmothered in the dust of ages. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. All right! all right! I'm going.\nFor gracious' sake don't conduct me to the door, or I'll really disgrace\nyou under Hector's uplifted nose. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Oh! shades of cold beef and\ntreacle pies of Worcester .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and washing-day .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. do you remember?\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. all right! all right, Monsieur my brother, I am dumb as a carp at\nlast.\"\n\nAnd with a final outburst of sarcastic laughter, Madame finally sailed\nacross the room, while Monsieur fell back into his throne-like chair\nwith a deep sigh of relief.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE RETURN OF THE EMPEROR\n\n\nI\n\nBut even as Madame la Duchesse douairi\u00c3\u00a8re d'Agen placed her aristocratic\nhand upon the handle of the door, it was opened from without with what\nmight almost be called undue haste, and Hector appeared in the doorway.\n\nHector in truth! but not the sober-faced, pompous, dignified Hector of\nthe household of M. le Comte de Cambray, but a red-visaged, excited,\nfussy Hector, who for the moment seemed to have forgotten where he was,\nas well as the etiquette which surrounded the august personality of his\nmaster. He certainly contrived to murmur a humble if somewhat hasty\napology, when he found himself confronted at the door by Mme. la\nDuchesse herself, but he did not stand aside to let her pass.\n\nShe had stepped back into the room at sight of him, for obviously\nsomething very much amiss must have occurred thus to ruffle Hector's\ningrained dignity, and even M. le Comte was involuntarily dragged out of\nhis aristocratic aloofness and almost--though not quite--jumped up from\nhis chair.\n\n\"What is it, Hector?\" he exclaimed, peremptorily.\n\n\"M. le Comte,\" gasped Hector, who seemed to be out of breath from sheer\nexcitement, \"the Corsican .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. he has come back .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. he is marching on\nGrenoble .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet is here! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nBut already M. le Comte had--with a wave of the hand as it were--swept\nthe unwelcome news aside.\n\n\"What rubbish is this?\" he said wrathfully. \"You have been dreaming in\nbroad daylight, Hector .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and this excitement is most unseemly. Show\nMme. la Duchesse to her apartments,\" he added with a great show of calm.\n\nHector--thus reproved, coloured a yet more violent crimson to the very\nroots of his hair. He made a great effort to recover his pomposity and\nactually took up the correct attitude which a well-trained servant\nassumes when he shows a great lady out of a room. But even then--despite\nthe well-merited reproof--he took it upon himself to insist:\n\n\"M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet is here, M. le Comte,\" he said, \"and begs to be received\nat once.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you may show him up when Mme. la Duchesse has retired,\"\nsaid the Comte with quiet dignity.\n\n\"By your leave, my brother,\" quoth the Duchesse decisively, \"I'll wait\nand hear what M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet has to say. The news--if news there be--is\ntoo interesting to be kept waiting for me.\"\n\nAnd accustomed as she was to get her own way in everything, Mme. la\nDuchesse calmly sailed back into the room, and once more sat down in the\nchair beside her brother's bureau, whilst Hector with as much grandeur\nof mien as he could assume under the circumstances was still waiting for\norders.\n\nM. le Comte would undoubtedly have preferred that his sister should\nleave the room before the pr\u00c3\u00a9fet was shown in: he did not approve of\nwomen taking part in political conversations, and his manner now plainly\nshowed to Mme. la Duchesse that he would like to receive M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet\nalone. But he said nothing--probably because he knew that words would be\nuseless if Madame had made up her mind to remain, which she evidently\nhad, so, after a brief pause, he said curtly to Hector:\n\n\"Show M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet in.\"\n\nHe took up his favourite position, in his throne-shaped chair--one leg\nbent, the other stretched out, displaying to advantage the shapely calf\nand well-shod foot. M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet Fourier, mathematician of great renown,\nand member of the Institut was one of those converted Bonapartists to\nwhom it behoved at all times to teach a lesson of decorum and dignity.\n\nAnd certainly when, presently Hector showed M. Fourier in, the two\nmen--the aristocrat of the old regime and the bureaucrat of the\nnew--presented a marked and curious contrast. M. le Comte de Cambray\ncalm, unperturbed, slightly supercilious, in a studied attitude and\nmoving with pompous deliberation to greet his guest, and Jacques\nFourier, man of science and pr\u00c3\u00a9fet of the Is\u00c3\u00a8re department, short of\nstature, scant of breath, flurried and florid!\n\nBoth men were conscious of the contrast, and M. Fourier did his very\nbest to approach Mme. la Duchesse with a semblance of dignity, and to\nkiss her hand in something of the approved courtly manner. When he had\nfinally sat down, and mopped his streaming forehead, M. le Comte said\nwith kindly condescension:\n\n\"You are perturbed, my good M. Fourier!\"\n\n\"Alas, M. le Comte,\" replied the worthy pr\u00c3\u00a9fet, still somewhat out of\nbreath, \"how can I help being agitated .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. this awful news! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"What news?\" queried the Comte with a lifting of the brows, which was\nmeant to convey complete detachment and indifference to the subject\nmatter.\n\n\"What news?\" exclaimed the pr\u00c3\u00a9fet who, on the other hand, was unable to\ncontain his agitation and had obviously given up the attempt, \"haven't\nyou heard? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the Comte.\n\nAnd Madame also shook her head.\n\n\"Town-gossip does not travel as far as the Castle of Brestalou,\" added\nM. le Comte gravely.\n\n\"Town gossip!\" reiterated M. Fourier, who seemed to be calling Heaven\nto witness this extraordinary levity, \"town gossip, M. le Comte! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nBut God in Heaven help us all. Bonaparte landed at Antibes five days\nago. He was at Sisteron this morning, and unless the earth opens and\nswallows him up, he will be on us by Tuesday!\"\n\n\"Bah! you have had a nightmare, M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet,\" rejoined the Comte drily.\n\"We have had news of the landing of Bonaparte at least once a month this\nhalf-year past.\"\n\n\"But it is authentic news this time, M. le Comte,\" retorted Fourier,\nwho, gradually, under the influence of de Cambray's calm demeanour, had\nsucceeded in keeping his agitation in check. \"The pr\u00c3\u00a9fet of the Var\ndepartment, M. le Comte de Bouthillier, sent an express courier on\nThursday last to the pr\u00c3\u00a9fet of the Basses-Alpes, who sent that courier\nstraight on to me, telling me that he and General Loverdo, who is in\ncommand of the troops in that district, promptly evacuated Digue because\nthey were not certain of the loyalty of the garrison. The Corsican it\nseems only landed with about a thousand of his old guard, but since\nthen, the troops in every district which he has traversed, have deserted\nin a body, and rallied round his standard. It has been, so I hear, a\ntriumphal march for him from the Littoral to Digne, and altogether the\nnews which the courier brought me this morning was of such alarming\nnature, that I thought it my duty, M. le Comte, to apprise you of it\nimmediately.\"\n\n\"That,\" said M. le Comte condescendingly, \"was exceedingly thoughtful\nand considerate, my good M. Fourier. And what is the alarming news?\"\n\n\"Firstly, that Bonaparte made something like a state entry into Digne\nyesterday. The city was beflagged and decorated. The national guard\nturned out and presented arms, drums were beating, the population\nacclaimed him with cries of 'Vive l'Empereur!' The pr\u00c3\u00a9fet and the\ngeneral in command had intended to resist his entry into the city, but\nall the notabilities of the town forced them into submission. Duval, the\npr\u00c3\u00a9fet, fled to a neighbouring village, taking the public funds with\nhim, while General Loverdo with a mere handful of loyal troops has\nretreated on Sisteron.\"\n\nThough M. le Comte de Cambray had listened to the pr\u00c3\u00a9fet's narrative\nwith all his habitual grandeur of mien, it soon became obvious that some\nof his aristocratic sangfroid had already abandoned him. His furrowed\ncheeks had become a shade paler than usual, and the slender hand which\ntoyed with an ivory paper-knife on his desk had not its wonted\nsteadiness. Mme. la Duchesse perceived this, no doubt, for her keen eyes\nwere fixed scrutinisingly upon her brother; she saw too that his thin\nlips were quivering and that the reason why he made no comment on what\nhe had just heard was because he could not quite trust himself to speak.\nIt was she, therefore, who now remarked quietly:\n\n\"And in your department, M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet, in Grenoble itself, is the\ngarrison equally likely to go over to the Corsican brigand?\"\n\nM. Fourier shrugged his shoulders. He was not at all sure.\n\n\"After what has happened at Digne, Mme. la Duchesse,\" he said, \"I would\nnot care to prophesy. G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Marchand does not intend to trust entirely\nto the garrison. He has sent to Vienne and to Chamb\u00c3\u00a9ry for\nreinforcements .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nThe pr\u00c3\u00a9fet was hesitating, evidently he had not a great deal of faith in\nthe loyalty of those reinforcements either.\n\nM. le Comte made a vigorous protest. \"Surely, M. Fourier,\" he said, \"you\ndon't mean to suggest that Grenoble is going to turn traitor to the\nKing?\"\n\nBut M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet apparently had meant to suggest it.\n\n\"Alas, M. le Comte!\" he said, \"we must always bear in mind that the\nwhole of the Dauphin\u00c3\u00a9 has remained throughout a bed of Bonapartism.\"\n\n\"But in that case .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" ejaculated the Comte.\n\n\"G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Marchand is doing all he can to ensure effectual resistance, M.\nle Comte. But we are in the hands of the army, and the army has never\nbeen truly loyal to the King. At the bottom of every soldier's haversack\nthere is an old and worn tricolour cockade, which is there ready to be\nfetched out at a moment's notice, and will be fetched out at the mere\nsound of the Corsican's voice. We are in the hands of the army, M. le\nComte, and in the Dauphin\u00c3\u00a9; alas! the army is only too ready to cry:\n'Vive l'Empereur!'\"\n\nThere was silence in the stately room now, silence only broken by the\ntap-tap of the ivory paper-knife with which M. le Comte was still\nnervously fidgeting. M. Fourier was wiping the perspiration from his\noverheated brow.\n\n\"For God's sake, Andr\u00c3\u00a9, stop that irritating noise,\" said Mme. Duchesse\nafter awhile, \"that tapping has got on my nerves.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Sophie,\" said the Comte loftily.\n\nHe was offended with her for drawing M. Fourier's attention to his own\nnervous restlessness, yet grateful to be thus forcibly made aware of it\nhimself. His attitude was on the verge of incorrectness. Where was the\naristocratic sangfroid which should have made him proof even against so\nmuch perturbing news? What had become of the lesson in decorum which\nshould have been taught to this vulgar little bureaucrat?\n\nM. le Comte pulled himself together with a jerk: he straightened out his\nspare figure, put on that air of detachment which became him so well,\nand finally turned once more to the pr\u00c3\u00a9fet a perfectly calm and\nunruffled countenance.\n\nThen he said with his accustomed urbanity:\n\n\"And now, my good M. Fourier, since you have so admirably put the\nsituation before me, will you also tell me in what way I may be of\nservice to you in this--or to G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Marchand?\"\n\n\"I am coming to that, M. le Comte,\" replied the pr\u00c3\u00a9fet. \"It will explain\nthe reason of my disturbing you at this hour, when I was coming anyhow\nto partake of your gracious hospitality later on. But I do want your\nassistance, M. le Comte, as the matter of which I wish to speak with you\nconcerns the King himself.\"\n\n\"Everything that you have told me hitherto, my good M. Fourier, concerns\nHis Majesty and the security of his throne. I cannot help wondering how\nmuch of this news has reached him by now.\"\n\n\"All of it at this hour, I should say. For already on Friday the Prince\nd'Essling sent a despatch to His Majesty--by courier as far as Lyons and\nthence by a\u00c3\u00abrial telegraph to Paris. The King--may God preserve him!\"\nadded the ex-Bonapartist fervently, \"knows as much of the Corsican's\nmovements at the present moment as we do; and God alone knows what he\nwill decide to do.\"\n\n\"Whatever happens,\" interjected the Comte de Cambray solemnly, \"Louis de\nBourbon, XVIIIth of his name, by the Grace of God, will act like a king\nand a gentleman.\"\n\n\"Amen to that,\" retorted the pr\u00c3\u00a9fet. \"And now let me come to my point,\nM. le Comte, and the chief object of my visit to you.\"\n\n\"I am at your service, my dear M. Fourier.\"\n\n\"You will remember, M. le Comte, that directly you were installed at\nBrestalou and I was confirmed in my position as pr\u00c3\u00a9fet of this\ndepartment, I thought it was my duty to tell you of the secret funds\nwhich are kept in the cellars of our H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville by order of M. de\nTalleyrand.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course I remember that perfectly. French money, which the\nunfortunate wife of that brigand Bonaparte was taking out of the\ncountry.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" assented Fourier. \"The funds are in a convenient and\nportable form, being chiefly notes and bankers' drafts to bearer, but\nthe amount is considerable, namely, twenty-five millions of francs.\"\n\n\"A comfortable sum,\" interposed Mme. la Duchesse drily. \"I did not know\nthat Grenoble sheltered so vast a treasure.\"\n\n\"The money was seized,\" said the Comte, \"from Marie Louise when she was\nfleeing the country. Talleyrand did it all, and it was his idea to keep\nthe money in this part of the country against likely emergencies.\"\n\n\"But the emergency has arisen,\" exclaimed M. Fourier excitedly, \"and the\nmoney at Grenoble is useless to His Majesty in Paris. Nay! it is worse\nthan useless, it is in danger of spoliation,\" he added with unconscious\n_naivet\u00c3\u00a9_. \"If the Corsican marches into Grenoble, if the garrison and\nthe townspeople rally to him, he will of a truth occupy the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de\nVille and the brigand will seize the King's treasure which lies now in\none of its cellars.\"\n\n\"True,\" mused the Comte, \"I hadn't thought of that.\"\n\n\"Well!\" exclaimed Madame with light sarcasm, \"seeing that the money was\noriginally taken from his wife, the brigand will not be committing an\naltogether unlikely act, I imagine, by taking what was originally his.\"\n\n\"His, my good Sophie?\" exclaimed the Comte, highly shocked. \"Money\nrobbed by that usurper from France--his?\"\n\n\"We won't argue, Andr\u00c3\u00a9,\" said Madame sharply, \"let us hear what M. le\npr\u00c3\u00a9fet proposes.\"\n\n\"Propose, Mme. la Duchesse,\" ejaculated the unfortunate pr\u00c3\u00a9fet, \"I have\nnothing to propose! I am at my wits' end what to do! I came to M. le\nComte for advice.\"\n\n\"And you were quite right, my dear M. Fourier,\" said the Comte affably.\n\nHe paused for a few seconds in order to collect his thoughts, then\ncontinued: \"Now let us consider this question from every side, and then\nsee to what conclusion we can arrive that will be for the best. Firstly,\nof course, there is the possibility of your following the example of the\npr\u00c3\u00a9fet of the Basses-Alpes and taking yourself and the money to a\nconvenient place outside Grenoble.\"\n\nBut at this suggestion M. Fourier was ready to burst into tears.\n\n\"Impossible, M. le Comte,\" he cried pitiably, \"I could not do it. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nWhere could I go? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. The existence of the money is known .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. known\nto the Bonapartists, I am convinced. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. There's Dumoulin, the\nglovemaker, he knows everything that goes on in Grenoble .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and his\nfriend Emery, who is an army surgeon in the pay of Bonaparte .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. both\nthese men have been to and from Elba incessantly these past few months\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. then there's the Bonapartist club in Grenoble .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. with a\nmembership of over two thousand .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. the members have friends and spies\neverywhere .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. even inside the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. why! the other day\nI had to dismiss a servant who .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Easy, easy, M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet,\" broke in M. le Comte impatiently, \"the long\nand the short of it is that you would not feel safe with the money\nanywhere outside Grenoble.\"\n\n\"Or inside it, M. le Comte.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, the money must be deposited there, where it will be\nsafe. Now what do you think of Dupont's Bank?\"\n\n\"Oh, M. le Comte! an avowed Bonapartist! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. M. de Talleyrand would\nnot trust him with the money last year.\"\n\n\"That is so .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" here interposed Mme. la Duchesse abruptly, \"that by\nfar the best plan--since this district seems to be a hot-bed of\ndisloyalty--would be to convey the money straightway to Paris, and then\nthe King or M. de Talleyrand can dispose of it as best they like.\"\n\n\"Ah, Mme. la Duchesse,\" sighed M. Fourier ecstatically as he clasped his\npodgy little hands together and looked on Madame with eyes full of\nadmiration for her wisdom, \"how cleverly that was spoken! If only I\ncould be relieved from that awful responsibility .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. five and twenty\nmillions under my charge and that Corsican ogre at our gates! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"That is all very well!\" quoth the Comte with marked impatience, \"but\nhow is it going to be done? 'Convey the money to Paris' is easily said.\nBut who is going to do it? M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet here says that the Bonapartists\nhave spies everywhere round Grenoble, and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Ah, M. le Comte!\" exclaimed the pr\u00c3\u00a9fet eagerly. \"I have already thought\nof such a beautiful plan! If only you would consent .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nM. le Comte's thin lips curled in a sarcastic smile.\n\n\"Oh! you have thought it all out already, M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet?\" he said. \"Well!\nlet me hear your plan, but I warn you that I will not have the money\nbrought here. I don't half trust the peasantry of the neighbourhood, and\nI won't have a fight or an outrage committed in my house!\"\n\nM. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet was ready with a protest:\n\n\"No, no, M. le Comte!\" he said, \"I wouldn't suggest such a thing for the\nworld. If the Corsican brigand is successful in capturing Grenoble, no\nplace would be sacred to him. No! My idea was if you, M. le Comte--who\nhave oft before journeyed to Paris and back--would do it now .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nbefore Bonaparte gets any nearer to Grenoble .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and take the money\nwith you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"I?\" exclaimed the Comte. \"But, man, if--as you say--Grenoble is full of\nBonapartist spies, my movements are no doubt just as closely watched as\nyour own.\"\n\n\"No, no, M. le Comte, not quite so closely, I am sure.\"\n\nThe insinuating manner of the worthy man, however, was apparently\ngetting on M. le Comte's nerves.\n\n\"Ah, \u00c3\u00a7a, M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet,\" he ejaculated abruptly, \"but meseems that the\nsplendid plan you thought on merely consists in transferring\nresponsibility from your shoulders to mine own.\"\n\nAnd M. le Comte cast such a wrathful look on poor M. Fourier that the\nunfortunate man was stricken dumb with confusion.\n\n\"Moreover,\" concluded the Comte, \"I don't know that you, M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet,\nhave the right to dispose of this money which was entrusted to you by M.\nde Talleyrand in the King's behalf without consulting His Majesty's\nwishes in the matter.\"\n\n\"Bah, Andr\u00c3\u00a9,\" broke in the Duchesse in her incisive way, \"you are\ntalking nonsense, and you know it. There is no time for red-tapeism now\nwith that ogre at our gates. How are you going to consult His Majesty's\nwishes--who is in Paris--between now and Tuesday, I would like to know?\"\nshe added with a shrug of the shoulders.\n\nWhereupon M. le Comte waxed politely sarcastic.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" he said, \"you would prefer us to consult yours.\"\n\n\"You might do worse,\" she retorted imperturbably. \"The question is one\nwhich is very easily solved. Ought His Majesty the King to have that\nmoney, or should M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet here take the risk of its falling in\nBonaparte's hands? Answer me that,\" she said decisively, \"and then I\nwill tell you how best to succeed in carrying out your own wishes.\"\n\n\"What a question, my good Sophie!\" said the Comte stiffly. \"Of course we\ndesire His Majesty to have what is rightfully his.\"\n\n\"You mean he ought to have the twenty-five millions which the Prince de\nB\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9vant stole from Marie Louise. Very well then, obviously that money\nought to be taken to Paris before Bonaparte gets much nearer to\nGrenoble--but it should not be taken by you, my good Andr\u00c3\u00a9, nor yet by\nM. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet.\"\n\n\"By whom then?\" queried the Comte irritably.\n\n\"By me,\" replied Mme. la Duchesse.\n\n\"By you, Sophie! Impossible!\"\n\n\"And God alive, why impossible, I pray you?\" she retorted. \"The money, I\nunderstand, is in a very portable form, notes and bankers' drafts, which\ncan be stowed away quite easily. Why shouldn't I be journeying back to\nParis after Crystal's wedding? Who would suspect me, I should like to\nknow, of carrying twenty-five millions under my petticoats? All I should\nwant would be a couple of sturdy fellows on the box to protect me\nagainst footpads. Impossible?\" she continued tartly. \"Men are always so\nready with that word. Get a sensible woman, I say, and she will solve\nyour difficulties before you have finished exclaiming: 'Impossible!'\"\n\nAnd she looked triumphantly from one man to the other. There was obvious\nrelief on the ruddy face of little M. Fourier, and even M. le Comte was\nvisibly taken with the idea.\n\n\"Well!\" he at last condescended to say, \"it does sound feasible after\nall.\"\n\n\"Feasible? Of course it's feasible,\" said Madame with a shrug of\ncontempt. \"Either the King is in want of the money, or he is not. Either\nBonaparte is likely to get it or he is not. If the King wants it, he\nmust have it at any cost and any risk. Twenty-five millions in\nBonaparte's hands at this juncture would help him to reconstitute his\narmy and make it very unpleasant for the King and for us all. M. le\npr\u00c3\u00a9fet, who has been in charge of the money all along, and M. le Comte\nde Cambray, who is the only true royalist in the district, are both\nmarked down by spies: ergo Mme. la Duchesse d'Agen is the only possible\nagent for the business, and an inoffensive old woman without any\npolitical standing is the least likely to be molested in her task. If I\nfail, I fail,\" concluded Madame decisively, \"if I am stopped on the way\nand the money taken from me, well! I am stopped, that's all! and M. le\npr\u00c3\u00a9fet or M. le Comte de Cambray or any male agent they may have sent\nwould have been stopped likewise. But I maintain that a woman travelling\nalone is far safer at this business and more likely to succeed than a\nman. So now, for God's sake, don't let's argue any more about it.\nCrystal is to be married on Tuesday and I could start that same\nafternoon. Can you bring the money over with you to-night?\"\n\nShe put her query directly to the pr\u00c3\u00a9fet, who was obviously overjoyed,\nand intensely relieved at the suggestion.\n\nM. le Comte too seemed to be won over by his sister's persuasive\nrhetoric: her strength of mind and firmness of purpose always imposed\nthemselves on those over whom she chose to exert her will: and men of\nsomewhat weak character like the Comte de Cambray came very easily under\nthe sway of her dominating personality.\n\nBut he thought it incumbent upon his dignity to make one more protest\nbefore he finally yielded to his sister's arguments.\n\n\"I don't like,\" he said, \"the idea of your travelling alone through the\ncountry without sufficient escort. The roads are none too safe and\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" broke in Madame impatiently. \"I pray you, Monsieur my brother, to\nstrengthen your arguments, if you are really determined to oppose this\nsensible scheme of mine. Travelling alone, forsooth! Did I not arrive\nonly yesterday, having travelled all the way from Boulogne and with no\nescort save two louts on the box of a hired coach?\"\n\n\"You chose to travel alone, my dear sister, for reasons best known to\nyourself,\" retorted the Comte, greatly angered that M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet should\nhear the fact that Mme. la Duchesse douairi\u00c3\u00a8re had travelled at any time\nwithout an escort.\n\n\"And who shall say me nay, if I choose to travel back alone again, I\nshould like to know? So now if you have exhausted your string of\nobjections, my dear brother, perhaps you will allow M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet to\nanswer my question.\"\n\nWhereupon M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet promptly satisfied Mme. la Duchesse on the point:\nhe certainly could and would bring the money over with him this evening.\nAnd M. le Comte had no further objections to offer.\n\nIn the archives of the Ministry of War in Paris, any one who looks may\nread that in the subsequent trial of G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Marchand for high\ntreason--after the Hundred Days and Napoleon's second abdication--pr\u00c3\u00a9fet\nFourier during the course of his evidence gave a detailed account of\nthis same interview which he had with M. le Comte de Cambray and Mme. la\nDuchesse douairi\u00c3\u00a8re d'Agen on Sunday, March the 5th. In his deposition\nhe naturally laid great stress upon his own zeal in the matter,\ndeclaring that he it was who finally overcame by his eloquence M. le\nComte's objections to the scheme and decided him to give his\nacquiescence thereto.[1]\n\n[Footnote 1: D\u00c3\u00a9position de Fourier. (Dossier de Marchant Arch. Guerre.)]\n\nCertain it is that there was but little argument after this between Mme.\nla Duchesse and the two men, and that the details of the scheme were\npresently discussed soberly and in all their bearings.\n\n\"I shall have the honour presently,\" said Fourier, \"of coming back here\nto respond to M. le Comte's gracious invitation to dinner. Why\nshouldn't I bring the money with me then?\"\n\n\"Indeed you must bring the money then,\" retorted the irascible old lady,\n\"and let there be no shirking or delay. Promptitude is our great chance\nof success. I ought not to start later than Tuesday, and I could do so\nsoon after the wedding ceremony. I could arrange to sleep at Lyons that\nnight, at Dijon the next day, be in Paris by Thursday evening and in the\nKing's presence on Friday.\"\n\n\"Provided you are not delayed,\" sighed the Comte.\n\n\"If I am delayed, my good Andr\u00c3\u00a9, then anyhow the game is up. But we are\nnot going to anticipate misfortune and we are going to believe in our\nlucky star.\"\n\n\"Would to God I could bring myself to approve wholeheartedly of this\nexpedition! The whole thing seems to me chivalrous and romantic rather\nthan prudent, and Heaven knows how prudent we should be just now!\"\n\n\"You look back on history, my dear brother,\" remarked Madame drily, \"and\nyou'll see that more great events have been brought about by chivalry\nand romance than by prudence and circumspection. The romance of Joan of\nArc delivered France from foreign yoke, the chivalry of Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois I.\nsaved the honour of France after the disaster of Pavie, and it certainly\nwas not prudence which set Henry of Navarre upon the throne of France\nand in the heart of his people. So for gracious' sake do not let us talk\nof prudence any more. Rather let us allow M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet to return quietly\nto the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville, so that he and Mme. Fourier may proceed to dress\nfor to-night's ceremony, just as if nothing untoward had happened. In\nthe meanwhile I will complete my preparations for Tuesday. There are one\nor two little details in connection with my journey--hostelries,\nservants, horses and so on--which you, my dear Andr\u00c3\u00a9, will kindly decide\nfor me. And now, gentlemen,\" she added, rising from her chair, \"I have\nthe honour to wish you both a very good afternoon.\"\n\nShe did not wait long enough to allow M. le Comte time to ring for\nHector, and she appeared so busy with her lace shawl that she was unable\nto do more than acknowledge with a slight inclination of the head M. le\npr\u00c3\u00a9fet's respectful salute. But then Mme. la Duchesse douairi\u00c3\u00a8re\nd'Agen--though a fervent royalist herself--had a wholesome contempt for\nthese opportunists. Fourier, celebrated mathematician, loaded with gifts\nand honours by Napoleon, who had made him a member of the Institute of\nScience and given him the prefecture of the Is\u00c3\u00a8re, had turned his coat\nvery readily at the Restoration, and the oaths of loyalty which he had\ntendered to the Emperor seemed not to weigh overheavily upon his\nconscience when he reiterated them to the King.\n\nMme. la Duchesse d'Agen, therefore, did not willingly place her\naristocratic fingers in the hand of a renegade, who she felt might turn\nrenegade again if his personal interest so dictated it. Perhaps\nsomething of what lay behind Madame's curt nod to him, struck the\npr\u00c3\u00a9fet's sensibilities, for the high colour suddenly fled from his round\nface, and he did not attempt to approach her for the ceremonial\nhand-kissing. But he ran across the room as fast as his short legs would\ncarry him, and he opened the door for her and bowed to her as she sailed\npast him with all the deference which in the olden days of the Empire he\nhad accorded to the Empress Marie Louise.\n\n\"It is a mad scheme, my good M. Fourier,\" sighed the Comte when he found\nhimself once more alone with the pr\u00c3\u00a9fet, \"but such as it is I can think\nof nothing better.\"\n\n\"M. le Comte,\" exclaimed the pr\u00c3\u00a9fet with delight, \"no one could think of\nanything better. Ah, the women of France!\" he added ecstatically, \"the\nwomen! how often have they saved France in moments of crises? France\nowes her grandeur to her women, M. le Comte!\"\n\n\"And also her reverses, my dear M. Fourier,\" remarked the Comte drily.\n\n\nII\n\nWhen Bobby Clyffurde came back to Brestalou, after his long day's ride,\nhe found the stately rooms of the old castle already prepared for the\narrival of M. le Comte's guests. The large reception hall had been\nthrown open, as--after supper--M. le Comte would be receiving some of\nthe notabilities of Grenoble in honour of a great occasion: the\nsignature of the _contrat de mariage_ between Mlle. Crystal de Cambray\nde Brestalou and M. Victor de Marmont. There was an array of liveried\nservants in the hall and along the corridor through which Bobby had to\npass on the way to his own room: their liveries of purple with canary\nfacings--the heraldic colours of the family of Cambray de\nBrestalou--hardly showed, in the flickering light of wax candles, the\nmany ravages of moth and mildew which twenty years of neglect had\nwrought upon the once fine and brilliant cloth.\n\nDownstairs the formal supper which was to precede the reception was laid\nfor twenty guests. The table was resplendent with the silver so kindly\nlent by a benevolent and far-seeing king to those of his friends who had\nnot the means of replacing the ancient family treasures filched from\nthem by the revolutionary government.\n\nThere were no flowers upon the table, and only very few wax candles\nburned in the ormolu and crystal chandelier overhead. Flowers and wax\ncandles were luxuries which must be paid for with ready money--a\ncommodity which was exceedingly scarce in the grandiose Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau de\nBrestalou--but they also were a luxury which could easily be dispensed\nwith, for did not M. le Comte de Cambray set the fashions and give the\ntone to the whole _d\u00c3\u00a9partement_? and if he chose to have no flowers upon\nhis supper table and but few candles in his silver sconces, why then\nsociety must take it for granted that such now was _bon ton_ and the\nprevailing fashion at the Tuileries.\n\nBobby, knowing his host's fastidious tastes in such matters, had made a\nvery careful toilet, all the while that his thoughts were busy with the\nwonderful news which Emery had brought this day, and which was all over\nGrenoble by now. He and his two companions had left Notre Dame de Vaulx\nsoon after their _d\u00c3\u00a9jeuner_, and together had entered the city at five\no'clock in the afternoon. On their way they had encountered the\ntravelling-coach of G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Mouton-Duveret, who, accompanied by his\naide-de-camp, was on his way to Gap, where he intended to organise\nstrong resistance against Bonaparte.\n\nHe parleyed some time with Emery, whom he knew by sight and suspected of\nbeing an emissary of the Corsican. Emery, with true southern verve, gave\nthe worthy general a highly-coloured account of the triumphal progress\nthrough Provence and the Dauphin\u00c3\u00a9 of Napoleon, whom he boldly called\n\"the Emperor.\" Mouton--in no way belying his name--was very upset not\nonly by the news, but by his own helplessness with regard to Emery, who\nhe knew would presently be in Grenoble distributing the usurper's\nproclamations all over the city, whilst he--Mouton--with his one\naide-de-camp and a couple of loutish servants on the box of his coach,\ncould do nothing to detain him.\n\nAs soon as the three men had ridden away, however, he sent his\naide-de-camp back to Grenoble by a round-about way, ordering him to make\nas great speed as possible, and to see G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Marchand as soon as may\nbe, so that immediate measures might be taken to prevent that emissary\nif not from entering the city, at least from posting up proclamations on\npublic buildings.\n\nBut Mouton's aide-de-camp was no match against the enthusiasm and\ningenuity of Emery and de Marmont, and when he--in his turn--entered\nGrenoble soon after five o'clock, he was confronted by the printed\nproclamations signed by the familiar and dreaded name \"Napoleon\" affixed\nto the gates of the city, to the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville, the mairie, the prison,\nthe barracks, and to every street corner in Grenoble.\n\nThe three friends had parted at the porte de Bonne, Emery to go to his\nfriend Dumoulin, the glovemaker--de Marmont to his lodgings in the rue\nMontorge, whilst Bobby Clyffurde rode straight back to Brestalou.\n\nA couple of hours later Victor de Marmont had also arrived at the\ncastle. He too had made an elaborate toilet, and then had driven over in\na hackney coach in advance of the other guests, seeing that he desired\nto have a final interview with M. le Comte before he affixed his name to\nhis _contrat de mariage_ with Mlle. de Cambray. An air of solemnity sat\nwell upon his good-looking face, but it was obvious that he was\ntrying--somewhat in vain--to keep an inward excitement in check.\n\nM. le Comte de Cambray, believing that this excitement was entirely due\nto the solemnity of the occasion, had smiled indulgently--a trifle\ncontemptuously too--at young de Marmont's very apparent eagerness. A\nvulgar display of feelings, an inability to control one's words and\nmovements when under the stress of emotion was characteristic of the\nparvenus of to-day, and de Marmont's unfettered agitation when coming to\nsign his own marriage contract was only on a par with pr\u00c3\u00a9fet Fourier's\nnervousness this afternoon.\n\nThe Comte received his future son-in-law with a gracious smile. The\nthought of an alliance between Mlle. de Cambray de Brestalou and a de\nMarmont of Nowhere had been a bitter pill to swallow, but M. le Comte\nwas too proud to show how distasteful it had been. Chatting pleasantly\nthe two men repaired together to the library.\n\n\nIII\n\nBobby Clyffurde--immaculately dressed in fine cloth coat and satin\nbreeches, with fine Mechlin lace at throat and wrist, and his light\nbrown hair tied at the nape of the neck with a big black bow--came down\npresently to the reception room. He found the place silent and deserted.\n\nBut the stately apartment looked more cosy and home-like than usual. A\ncheerful fire was burning in the monumental hearth and the soft light of\nthe candles fixed in sconces round the walls tempered to a certain\ndegree that bare and severe look of past grandeur which usually hung\nupon every corner of the old ch\u00c3\u00a2teau.\n\nClyffurde went up to the tall hearth. He rested his hand on the ledge of\nthe mantel and leaning his forehead against it he stared moodily into\nthe fire.\n\nThoughts of all that he had learned in the past few hours, of the new\nchapter in the book of the destinies of France, begun a few days ago in\nthe bay of Jouan, crowded in upon his mind. What difference would the\nunfolding of that new chapter make to the destinies of the Comte de\nCambray and of Crystal? What had Fate in store for the bold adventurer\nwho was marching across France with a handful of men to reconquer a\nthrone and remake an empire? what had she in store for the stiff-necked\naristocrat of the old regime who still believed that God himself had\nmade special laws for the benefit of one class of humanity, and that He\nhad even created them differently to the rest of mankind?\n\nAnd what had Fate in store for the beautiful, delicate girl whose future\nhad been so arbitrarily settled by two men--father and lover--one the\nbuyer, the other the seller of her exquisite person, the shrine of her\npure and idealistic soul--and bargained for by father and lover as the\nprice of so many acres of land--a farm--a ch\u00c3\u00a2teau--an ancestral estate?\n\nFather and lover were sitting together even now discussing values--the\npurchase price--\"You give me back my lands, I will give you my\ndaughter!\" Blood money! soul money! Clyffurde called it as he ground his\nteeth together in impotent rage.\n\nWhat folly it was to care! what folly to have allowed the tendrils of\nhis over-sensitive heart to twine themselves round this beautiful girl,\nwho was as far removed from his destiny as were the ambitions of his\nboyhood, the hopes, the dreams which the hard circumstances of fate had\nforced him to bury beneath the grave-mound of rigid and unswerving duty.\n\nBut what a dream it had been, this love for Crystal de Cambray! It had\nfilled his entire soul from the moment when first he saw her--down in\nthe garden under an avenue of ilex trees which cast their mysterious\nshadows over her; her father had called to her and she had come across\nto where he--Clyffurde--stood silently watching this approaching vision\nof loveliness which never would vanish from his mental gaze again.\n\nEven at that supreme moment, when her blue eyes, her sweet smile, the\nexquisite grace of her took possession of his soul, even then he knew\nalready that his dream could have but one awakening. She was already\nplighted to another, a happier man, but even if she were free, Crystal\nwould never have bestowed a thought upon the stranger--the commonplace\ntradesman, whose only merit in her sight lay in his friendship with\nanother gallant English gentleman.\n\nAnd knowing this--when he saw her after that, day after day, hour after\nhour--poor Bobby Clyffurde grew reconciled to the knowledge that the\ngates of his Paradise would for ever be locked against him: he grew\ncontented just to peep through those gates; and the Angel who was on\nguard there, holding the flaming sword of caste prejudice against him,\nwould relent at times and allow him to linger on the threshold and to\ngaze into a semblance of happiness.\n\nThose thoughts, those dreams, those longings, he had been able to\nendure; to-day reality had suddenly become more insistent and more\nstern: the Angel's flaming sword would sear his soul after this, if he\nlingered any longer by the enchanted gates: and thus had the semblance\nof happiness yielded at last to dull regret.\n\nHe sank into a chair and buried his face in his hands.\n\n\nIV\n\nThe sound of the opening and shutting of a door, the soft frou-frou of a\nwoman's skirt roused him from his gloomy reverie, and caused him to jump\nto his feet.\n\nMlle. Crystal was coming across the long reception room, walking with a\nslow and weary step toward the hearth. She was obviously not yet aware\nof Clyffurde's presence, and he had full leisure to watch her as she\napproached, to note the pallor of her cheeks and lips and that pathetic\nlook of childlike self-pity and almost of appeal which veiled the\nbrilliance of her deep blue eyes.\n\nA moment later she saw him and came more quickly across the room, with\nhand extended, and an air of gracious condescension in her whole\nattitude.\n\n\"Ah! M. Clyffurde,\" she said in perfect English, \"I did not know you\nwere here .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and all alone. My father,\" she added, \"is occupied with\nserious matters downstairs, else he would have been here to receive\nyou.\"\n\n\"I know, Mademoiselle,\" he said after he had kissed the tips of three\ncold little fingers which had been held out to him. \"My friend de\nMarmont is with him just now: he desired to speak with M. le Comte in\nprivate .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. on a matter which closely concerns his happiness.\"\n\n\"Ah! then you knew?\" she asked coldly.\n\n\"Yes, Mademoiselle, I knew,\" he replied.\n\nShe had settled herself down in a high-backed chair close to the hearth,\nthe ruddy light of the wood-fire played upon her white satin gown, upon\nher bare arms, and the ends of her lace scarf, upon her satin shoes and\nthe bunch of snowdrops at her breast, but her face was in shadow and she\ndid not look up at Clyffurde, whilst he--poor fool!--stood before her,\nabsorbed in the contemplation of this dainty picture which mayhap after\nto-night would never gladden his eyes again.\n\n\"You are a great friend of M. de Marmont?\" she asked after a while.\n\n\"Oh, Mademoiselle--a friend?\" he replied with a self-deprecatory shrug\nof the shoulders, \"friendship is too great a name to give to our chance\nacquaintanceship. I met Victor de Marmont less than a fortnight ago, in\nGrenoble. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Ah yes! I had forgotten--he told me that he had first met you at the\nhouse of a M. Dumoulin .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"In the shop of M. Dumoulin, Mademoiselle,\" broke in Clyffurde with his\ngood-humoured smile. \"M. Dumoulin, the glovemaker, with whom I was\ntransacting business at the moment when M. de Marmont walked in, in\norder to buy himself a pair of gloves.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" she added coldly, \"I had forgotten. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"You were not likely to remember such a trivial circumstance,\nMademoiselle. M. de Marmont saw me after that here as guest in your\nfather's house. He was greatly surprised at finding me--a mere\ntradesman--in such an honoured position. Surprise laid the foundation of\npleasing intercourse between us, but you see, Mademoiselle, that M. de\nMarmont has no cause to boast of his friendship with me.\"\n\n\"Oh! M. de Marmont is not so prejudiced. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"As you are, Mademoiselle?\" he asked quietly, for she had paused and he\nsaw that she bit her lips with her tiny white teeth as if she meant to\ncheck the words that would come tumbling out.\n\nThus directly questioned she gave a little shrug of disdain.\n\n\"My opinions in the matter are not in question, Sir,\" she said coldly.\n\nShe smothered a little yawn which may have been due to ennui, but also\nto the tingling of her nerves. Clyffurde saw that her hands were never\nstill for a moment; she was either fingering the snowdrops in her belt\nor smoothing out the creases in her lace scarf; from time to time she\nraised her head and a tense expression came into her face, as if she\nwere trying to listen to what was going on elsewhere in the\nhouse--downstairs perhaps--in the library where she was being finally\nbargained for and sold.\n\nClyffurde felt an intense--an unreasoning pity for her, and because of\nthat pity--the gentle kinsman of fierce love--he found it in his heart\nto forgive her all her prejudices, that almost arrogant pride of caste\nwhich was in her blood, for which she was no more responsible than she\nwas for the colour of her hair or the vivid blue of her eyes; she seemed\nso forlorn--such a child, in the midst of all this decadent grandeur.\nShe was being so ruthlessly sacrificed for ideals that were no longer\ntenable, that had ceased to be tenable five and twenty years ago when\nthis ch\u00c3\u00a2teau and these lands were overrun by a savage and vengeful mob,\nwho were loudly demanding the right to live in happiness, in comfort,\nand in freedom. That right had been denied to them through the past\ncenturies by those who were of her own kith and kin, and it was\nsnatched with brutal force, with lust of hate and thirst for reprisals,\nby the revolutionary crowd when it came into its own at last.\n\nSomething of the pity which he felt for this beautiful and innocent\nvictim of rancour, oppression and prejudice, must have been manifest in\nClyffurde's earnest eyes, for when Crystal looked up to him and met his\nglance she drew herself up with an air of haughty detachment. And with\nthat, she wished to convey still more tangibly to him the idea of that\nbarrier of caste which must for ever divide her from him.\n\nObviously his look of pity had angered her, for now she said abruptly\nand with marked coldness:\n\n\"My father tells me, Sir, that you are thinking of leaving France\nshortly.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Mademoiselle,\" he replied, \"I have trespassed too long as it is\non M. le Comte's gracious hospitality. My visit originally was only for\na fortnight. I thought of leaving for England to-morrow.\"\n\nA little lift of the eyebrows, an unnecessary smoothing of an invisible\ncrease in her gown and Crystal asked lightly:\n\n\"Before the .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. my wedding, Sir?\"\n\n\"Before your wedding, Mademoiselle.\"\n\nShe frowned--vaguely stirred to irritation by his ill-concealed\nindifference. \"I trust,\" she rejoined pointedly, \"that you are satisfied\nwith your trade in Grenoble.\"\n\nThe little shaft was meant to sting, but if Bobby felt any pain he\ncertainly appeared to bear it with perfect good-humour.\n\n\"I am quite satisfied,\" he said. \"I thank you, Mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"It must be very pleasing to conclude such affairs satisfactorily,\" she\ncontinued.\n\n\"Very pleasing, Mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Of course--given the right temperament for such a career--it must be so\nmuch more comfortable to spend one's life in making money--buying and\nselling things and so on--rather than to risk it every day for the\nbarren honour of serving one's king and country.\"\n\n\"As you say, Mademoiselle,\" he said quite imperturbably, \"given the\nright temperament, it certainly is much more comfortable.\"\n\n\"And you, Sir, I take it, are the happy possessor of such a\ntemperament.\"\n\n\"I suppose so, Mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"You are content to buy and to sell and to make money? to rest at ease\nand let the men who love their country and their king fight for you and\nfor their ideals?\"\n\nHer voice had suddenly become trenchant and hard, her manner\ncontemptuous--at strange variance with the indifferent kindliness\nwherewith she had hitherto seemed to regard her father's English guest.\nCertainly her nerves--he thought--were very much on edge, and no doubt\nhis own always unruffled calm--the combined product of temperament,\nnationality and education--had an irritating effect upon her. Had he not\nbeen so intensely sorry for her, he would have resented this final taunt\nof hers--an arrow shot this time with intent to wound.\n\nBut as it was he merely said with a smile:\n\n\"Surely, Mademoiselle, my contentment with my own lot, and any other\nfeelings of which I may be possessed, are of such very little\nconsequence--seeing that they are only the feelings of a very\ncommonplace tradesman--that they are not worthy of being discussed.\"\n\nThen as quickly her manner changed: the contemptuous look vanished from\nher eyes, the sarcastic curl from her lips, and with one of those quick\ntransitions of mood which were perhaps the principal charm of Crystal de\nCambray's personality, she looked up at Bobby with a winning smile and\nan appeal for forgiveness.\n\n\"Your pardon, Sir,\" she said softly. \"I was shrewish and ill-tempered,\nand deserve a severe lesson in courtesy. I did not mean to be\ndisagreeable,\" she added with a little sigh, \"but my nerves are all\na-quiver to-day and this awful news has weighed upon my spirit. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"What awful news, Mademoiselle?\" he asked.\n\n\"Surely you have heard?\"\n\n\"You mean the news about Napoleon .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0?\"\n\n\"I mean the awful certainty,\" she retorted with a sudden outburst of\nvehemence, \"that that brigand, that usurper, that scourge of mankind has\nescaped from an all too lenient prison where he should never have been\nconfined, seeing how easy was escape from it. I mean that all the\nhorrors of the past twenty years will begin again now, misery,\nstarvation, exile probably. Oh, surely,\" she added with ever-increasing\npassion, \"surely God will not permit such an awful thing to happen;\nsurely he will strike the ogre dead, ere he devastates France once\nagain!\"\n\n\"I am afraid that you must not reckon quite so much on divine\ninterference, Mademoiselle. A nation--like every single individual--must\nshape its own destiny, and must not look to God to help it in its\npolitical aims.\"\n\n\"And France must look once more to England, I suppose. It is humiliating\nto be always in need of help,\" she said with an impatient little sigh.\n\n\"Each nation in its turn has it in its power to help a sister. Sometimes\nhelp may come from the weaker vessel. Do you remember the philosopher's\nfable of the lion and the mouse? France may be the mouse just now--some\nday it may be in her power to requite the lion.\"\n\nShe shook her head reprovingly. \"I don't know,\" she said, \"that I\napprove of your calling France--the mouse.\"\n\n\"I only did so in order to drive my parable still further home.\"\n\nThen as she looked a little puzzled, he continued--speaking very slowly\nthis time and with an intensity of feeling which was quite different to\nhis usual pleasant, good-tempered, oft-times flippant manner:\n\"Mademoiselle Crystal--if you will allow me to speak of such an\ninsignificant person as I am--I am at present in the position of the\nmouse with regard to your father and yourself--the lions of my parable.\nYou might so easily have devoured me, you see,\" he added with a quaint\ntouch of humour. \"Well! the time may come when you may have need of a\nfriend, just as I had need of one when I came here--a stranger in a\nstrange land. Events will move with great rapidity in the next few days,\nMademoiselle Crystal, and the mouse might at any time be in a position\nto render a service to the lion. Will you remember that?\"\n\n\"I will try, Monsieur,\" she replied.\n\nBut already her pride was once more up in arms. She did not like his\ntone, that air of protection which his attitude suggested. And indeed\nshe could not think of any eventuality which would place the Comte de\nCambray de Brestalou in serious need of a tradesman for his friend.\n\nThen as quickly again her mood softened and as she raised her eyes to\nhis he saw that they were full of tears.\n\n\"Indeed! indeed!\" she said gently, \"I do deserve your contempt, Sir, for\nmy shrewishness and vixenish ways. How can I--how can any of us--afford\nto turn our backs upon a loyal friend? To-day too, of all days, when\nthat awful enemy is once more at our gates! Oh!\" she added, clasping her\nhands together with a sudden gesture of passionate entreaty, \"you are\nEnglish, Sir--a friend of all those gallant gentlemen who saved my dear\nfather and his family from those awful revolutionaries--you will be\nloyal to us, will you not? The English hate Bonaparte as much as we do!\nyou hate him too, do you not? you will do all you can to help my poor\nfather through this awful crisis? You will, won't you?\" she pleaded.\n\n\"Have I not already offered you my humble services, Mademoiselle?\" he\nrejoined earnestly.\n\nIndeed this was a very serious ordeal for quiet, self-contained Bobby\nClyffurde--an Englishman, remember--with all an Englishman's shyness of\nemotion, all an Englishman's contempt of any display of sentiment. Here\nwas this beautiful girl--whom he loved with all the passionate ardour of\nhis virile, manly temperament--sitting almost at his feet, he looking\ndown upon her fair head, with its wealth of golden curls, and into her\nblue eyes which were full of tears.\n\nWho shall blame him if just then a desperate longing seized him to throw\nall prudence, all dignity and honour to the winds and to clasp this\nexquisite woman for one brief and happy moment in his arms--to forget\nthe world, her position and his--to risk disgrace and betray\nhospitality, for the sake of one kiss upon her lips? The temptation was\nso fierce--indeed for one short second it was all but irresistible--that\nsomething of the battle which was raging within his soul became\noutwardly visible, and in the girl's tear-dimmed eyes there crept a\nquick look of alarm--so strange, so ununderstandable was his glance, the\nrigidity of his attitude--as if every muscle had become taut and every\nnerve strained to snapping point, while his face looked hard and lined,\nalmost as if he were fighting physical pain.\n\n\nV\n\nThus a few seconds went by in absolute silence--while the great gilt\nclock upon its carved bracket ticked on with stolid relentlessness,\nmarking another minute--and yet another--of this hour which was so full\nof portent for the destinies of France. Clyffurde would gladly have\nbartered the future years of his life for the power to stay the hand of\nTime just now--for the power to remain just like this, standing before\nthis beautiful woman whom he loved, feeling that at any moment he could\ntake her in his arms and kiss her eyes and her lips, even if she were\nunwilling, even if she hated him for ever afterwards.\n\nThe sense of power to do that which he might regret to the end of his\ndays was infinitely sweet, the power to fight against that\nall-compelling passion was perhaps sweeter still. Then came the pride of\nvictory. The habits of a lifetime had come to his aid: self-respect and\nself-control, hard and wilful taskmasters, fought against passion, until\nit yielded inch by inch.\n\nThe battle was fought and won in those few moments of silence: the\nstrain of the man's attitude relaxed, the set lines on his face\nvanished, leaving it serene and quietly humorous, calm and\nself-deprecatory. Only his voice was not quite so steady as usual, as he\nsaid softly:\n\n\"Mademoiselle Crystal, is there anything that I can do for you?--now at\nonce, I mean? If there is, I do entreat you most earnestly to let me\nserve you.\"\n\nHad the pure soul of the woman been touched by the fringe of that\nmagnetic wave of passion even as it rose to its utmost height, nearly\nsweeping the man off his feet, and in its final retreat leaving him with\nquivering nerves and senses bruised and numb? Did something of the man's\nsuffering, of his love and of his despair appear--despite his\nefforts--upon his face and in the depth of his glance?--and thus made\nvisible did they--even through their compelling intensity--cause that\ninvisible barrier of social prejudices to totter and to break? It were\ndifficult to say. Certain it is that Crystal's whole heart warmed to the\nstranger as it had never warmed before. She felt that here was a _man_\nstanding before her now, whose promises would never be mere idle words,\nwhose deeds would speak more loudly than his tongue. She felt that in\nthe midst of all the enmity which encompassed her and her father in\ntheir newly regained home and land, here at any rate was a friend on\nwhom they could count to help, to counsel and to accomplish. And deep\ndown in the very bottom of her soul there was a curious unexplainable\nlonging that circumstances should compel her to ask one day for his\nhelp, and a sweet knowledge that that help would be ably rendered and\npleasing to receive.\n\nBut for the moment, of course, there was nothing that she could ask: she\nwould be married in a couple of days--alas! so soon!--and after that it\nwould be to her husband that she must look for devotion, for guidance\nand for sympathy.\n\nA little sigh of regret escaped her lips, and she said gently:\n\n\"I thank you, Sir, from the bottom of my heart, for the words of\nfriendship which you have spoken. I shall never forget them, never! and\nif at any time in my life I am in trouble .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Which God forbid!\" he broke in fervently.\n\n\"If any time I have need of a friend,\" she resumed, \"I feel that I\nshould find one in you. Oh! if only I could think that you would extend\nyour devotion to my poor country, and to our King .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" she exclaimed\nwith passionate earnestness.\n\n\"You love your country very dearly, Mademoiselle,\" he rejoined.\n\n\"I think that I love France more than anything else in the world,\" she\nreplied, \"and I feel that there is no sacrifice which I would deem too\ngreat to offer up for her.\"\n\n\"And by France you mean the Bourbon dynasty,\" he said almost\ninvoluntarily, and with an impatient little sigh.\n\n\"I mean the King, by the grace of God!\" she retorted proudly.\n\nShe had thrown back her head with an air of challenge as she said this,\nmeeting his glance eye to eye: she looked strong and wilful all of a\nsudden, no longer girlish and submissive. And to the man who loved her,\nthis trait of power and latent heroism added yet another to the many\ncharms which he saw in her. Loyal to her country and to her king she\nwould be loyal in all things--to husband, kindred and to friends.\n\nBut he realised at the same time how impossible it would be for any man\nto win her love if he were an enemy to her cause. St. Genis--royalist,\n\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9, retrograde like herself--had obviously won his way to her heart\nchiefly by the sympathy of his own convictions. But what of de Marmont,\nto whom she was on the eve of plighting her troth? de Marmont the\nhot-headed Bonapartist who owned but one god--Napoleon--and yet had\ndeliberately, and with cynical opportunism hidden his fanatical aims and\nbeliefs from the woman whom he had wooed and won?\n\nThe thought of that deception--and of the awakening which would await\nthe girl-wife on the very morrow of her wedding-day mayhap, was terribly\nrepellent to Clyffurde's straightforward, loyal nature, and bitter was\nthe contention within his soul as he found himself at the cross-roads of\na divided duty. Every instinct of chivalry towards the woman loudly\ndemanded that he should warn her--now--at once--before it was too\nlate--before she had actually pledged her life and future to a man whom\nher very soul--if she knew the truth--would proclaim a renegade and a\ntraitor; and every instinct of loyalty to the man--that male solidarity\nof sex which will never permit one man--if he be a gentleman--to betray\nanother--prompted him to hold his peace.\n\nCrystal's gentle voice fell like dream-tones upon his ear. Vaguely only\ndid he hear what she said. She was still speaking of France, of all that\nthe country had suffered and all that was due to her from her sons and\ndaughters: she spoke of the King, God's own anointed as she called him,\nendowed with rights divine, and all the while his thoughts were far\naway, flying on the wings of memory to the little hamlet among the\nmountains where two enthusiasts had exhausted every panegyric in praise\nof their own hero, whom this girl called a usurper and a brigand. He\nremembered every trait in de Marmont's face, every inflexion of his\nvoice as he said with almost cruel cynicism: \"She will learn to love me\nin time.\"\n\nThat, Clyffurde knew now, Crystal de Cambray would never do. Indifferent\nto de Marmont to-day, she would hate and loathe him the day that she\ndiscovered how infamously he had deceived her: and to Clyffurde's\npassionate temperament the thought of Crystal's future unhappiness was\nabsolutely intolerable.\n\nHere indeed was a battle far more strenuous and difficult of issue than\nthat of a man's will against his passions: here was a problem far more\ndifficult to solve than any that had assailed Bobby Clyffurde throughout\nhis life.\n\nHis heart cried out \"She must know the truth: she must. To-day! this\nminute, while there was yet time! Anon she will be pledged irrevocably\nto a man who has lied to her, whom she will curse as a renegade, a\ntraitor, false to his country, false to his king!\"\n\nAnd the words hovered on his lips: \"Mademoiselle Crystal! do not plight\nyour troth to de Marmont! he is no friend of yours, his people are not\nyour people! his God is not your God! and there is neither blessing nor\nholiness in an union 'twixt you and him!\"\n\nBut the words remained unspoken, because the unwritten code--the bond\n'twixt man and man--tried to still this natural cry of his heart and\nreason argued that he must hold his peace. His heart rebelled,\ncontending that to remain silent was cowardly--that his first duty was\nto the woman whom he loved better than his soul, whilst ingrained\nprinciples, born and bred in the bone of him, threw themselves into the\nconflict, warning him that if he spoke he would be no better than an\ninformer, meriting the contempt alike of those whom he wished to help\nand of the man whom he would betray.\n\nIt was one sound coming from below which settled the dispute 'twixt\nheart and reason--the sound of de Marmont's voice which though he was\napparently speaking of indifferent matters had that same triumphant ring\nin it which Clyffurde had heard at Notre Dame de Vaulx this morning.\n\nThe sound had caused Crystal to give a quick gasp and to clasp her hands\nagainst her breast, as she said with a nervous little laugh:\n\n\"Imagine how happy we are to have M. de Marmont's support in this\nterrible crisis! His influence in Grenoble and in the whole province is\nvery great: his word in the town itself may incline the whole balance of\npublic feeling on the side of the King, and who knows, it may even help\nto strengthen the loyalty of the troops. Oh! that Corsican brigand\nlittle guesses what kind of welcome we in the Dauphin\u00c3\u00a9 are preparing for\nhim!\"\n\nHer enthusiasm, her trust, her loyalty ended the conflict in Clyffurde's\nmind far more effectually than any sober reasoning could have done. He\nrealised in a moment that neither abstract principles, nor his own\nfeelings in the matter, were of the slightest account at such a\njuncture.\n\nWhat was obvious, certain, and not to be shirked, was duty to a woman\nwho was on the point of being shamefully deceived, also duty to the man\nwhose hospitality he had enjoyed. To remain silent would be cowardly--of\nthat he became absolutely certain, and once Bobby had made up his mind\nwhat duty was no power on earth could make him swerve from its\nfulfilment.\n\n\"Mlle. Crystal,\" he began slowly and deliberately, \"just now, when I was\nbold enough to offer you my friendship, you deigned to accept it, did\nyou not?\"\n\n\"Indeed I did, Sir,\" she replied, a little astonished. \"Why should you\nask?\"\n\n\"Because the time has come sooner than I expected for me to prove the\ntruth of that offer to you. There is something which I must say to you\nwhich no one but a friend ought to do. May I?\"\n\nBut before she could frame the little \"Yes!\" which already trembled on\nher lips, her father's voice and de Marmont's rang out from the further\nend of the room itself.\n\nThe folding doors had been thrown open: M. le Comte and his son-in-law\nelect were on the point of entering and had paused for a moment just\nunder the lintel. De Marmont was talking in a loud voice and apparently\nin response to something which M. le Comte had just told him.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said, \"Mme. la Duchesse will be leaving Brestalou? I am sorry\nto hear that. Why should she go so soon?\"\n\n\"An affair of business, my dear de Marmont,\" replied the Comte. \"I will\ntell you about it at an early opportunity.\"\n\nAfter which there was a hubbub of talk in the corridors outside, the\nsound of greetings, the pleasing confusion of questions and answers\nwhich marks the simultaneous arrival of several guests.\n\nCrystal rose and turned to Bobby with a smile.\n\n\"You will have to tell me some other time,\" she said lightly. \"Don't\nforget!\"\n\nThe psychological moment had gone by and Clyffurde cursed himself for\nhaving fought too long against the promptings of his heart and lost the\nprecious moments which might have changed the whole of Crystal's\nfuture. He cursed himself for not having spoken sooner, now that he saw\nde Marmont with glowing eyes and ill-concealed triumph approach his\nbeautiful fianc\u00c3\u00a9e and with the air of a conqueror raise her hand to his\nlips.\n\nShe looked very pale, and to the man who loved her so ardently and so\nhopelessly it seemed as if she gave a curious little shiver and that for\none brief second her blue eyes flashed a pathetic look of appeal up to\nhis.\n\n\nVI\n\nM. le Comte's guests followed closely on the triumphant bridegroom's\nheels: M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet, fussy and nervous, secretly delighted at the idea\nof affixing his official signature to such an aristocratic _contrat de\nmariage_ as was this between Mlle. de Cambray de Brestalou and M. Victor\nde Marmont, own nephew to Marshal the duc de Raguse; Madame la pr\u00c3\u00a9f\u00c3\u00a8te,\nresplendent in the latest fashion from Paris, the Duc and Duchesse\nd'Embrun, cousins of the bride, the Vicomte de G\u00c3\u00a9nevois and his mother,\nwho was Abbess of Pont Haut and godmother by proxy to Crystal de\nCambray; whilst G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Marchand, in command of the troops of the\ndistrict, fresh from the Council of War which he had hastily convened,\nwas trying to hide behind a _d\u00c3\u00a9bonnaire_ manner all the anxiety which\n\"the brigand's\" march on Grenoble was causing him.\n\nThe chief notabilities of the province had assembled to do honour to the\noccasion, later on others would come, lesser lights by birth and\nposition than this select crowd who would partake of the _souper des\nfian\u00c3\u00a7ailles_ before the _contrat_ was signed in their presence as\nwitnesses to the transaction.\n\nEveryone was talking volubly: the ogre's progress through France--no\nlonger to be denied--was the chief subject of conversation. Some spoke\nof it with contempt, others with terror. The ex-Bonapartists Fourier\nand Marchand were loudest in their curses against \"the usurper.\"\n\nClyffurde, silent and keeping somewhat aloof from the brilliant throng,\nsaw that de Marmont did not enter into any of these conversations. He\nkept resolutely close to Crystal, and spoke to her from time to time in\na whisper, and always with that assured air of the conqueror, which\ngrated so unpleasantly on Clyffurde's irritable nerves.\n\nThe Comte, affable and gracious, spoke a few words to each of his guests\nin turn, whilst Mme. la Duchesse douairi\u00c3\u00a8re d'Agen was talking openly of\nher forthcoming return journey to the North.\n\n\"I came in great haste,\" she said loudly to the circle of ladies\ngathered around her, \"for my little Crystal's wedding. But I was in the\nmiddle of a Lenten retreat at the Sacred Heart, and I only received\npermission from my confessor to spend three days in all this gaiety.\"\n\n\"When do you leave us again, Mme. la Duchesse?\" queried Mlle. Marchand,\nthe General's daughter, in a honeyed voice.\n\n\"On Tuesday, directly after the religious ceremony, Mademoiselle,\"\nreplied Madame, whilst M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet tried to look unconcerned. He had\nbrought the money over as Mme. la Duchesse had directed. Twenty-five\nmillions of francs in notes and drafts had been transferred from the\ncellar of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville to his own pockets first and then into the\nkeeping of Madame. He had driven over from the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville in his\nprivate coach, he himself in an agony of fear every time the road looked\nlonely, or he heard the sound of horse's hoofs upon the road behind\nhim--for there might be mounted highwaymen about. Now he felt infinitely\nrelieved; he had shifted all responsibility of that vast sum of money on\nto more exalted shoulders than his own, and inwardly he was marvelling\nhow coolly Mme. la Duchesse seemed to be taking such an awful\nresponsibility.\n\nNow Hector threw open the great doors and announced that M. le Comte was\nserved. Through the vast corridor beyond appeared a vista of liveried\nservants in purple and canary, wearing powdered perruque, silk stockings\nand buckled shoes.\n\nThere was a general hubbub in the room, the men moved towards the ladies\nwho had been assigned to them for partners. M. le Comte in his grandest\nmanner approached Mme. la Duchesse d'Embrun in order to conduct her down\nto supper. An air of majestic grandeur, of solemnity and splendid\ndecorum pervaded the fine apartment; it sought out every corner of the\nvast reception room, flickered round every wax candle; it spread itself\nover the monumental hearth, the stiff brocade-covered chairs, the gilt\nconsoles and tall mirrors. It emanated alike from the graciousness of M.\nle Comte de Cambray and the pompousness of his majordomo. Hector in fact\nappeared at this moment as the high priest in a temple of good manners\nand bon ton: the muscles of his face were rigid, his mouth was set as if\nready to pronounce sacrificial words; in his right hand he carried a\ngold-headed wand, emblem of his high office.\n\nBut suddenly there was a disturbance--an unseemly noise came from the\nfurther end of the corridor, where rose the magnificent staircase.\nHector's face became a study in rapidly changing expressions: from\npompousness, to astonishment, then horror, and finally wrath when he\nrealised that an intruder in stained cloth clothes and booted and\nspurred was actually making his way through the ranks of liveried and\ngaping servants and loudly demanding to speak with M. le Comte.\n\nSuch an unseemly disturbance had not occurred at the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau de\nBrestalou since Hector had been installed there as majordomo nearly\ntwelve months ago, and he was on the point of literally throwing\nhimself upon the impious malapert who thus dared to thrust his ill-clad\nperson upon the brilliant company, when he paused--more aghast than\nbefore. In this same impious malapert he had recognised M. le Marquis de\nSt. Genis!\n\nThe young man looked to be labouring under terrible excitement: his face\nwas flushed and he was panting as if he had been running hard:\n\n\"M. le Comte!\" he cried breathlessly as soon as he caught sight of\nHector, \"tell M. le Comte that I must speak with him at once.\"\n\n\"But M. le Marquis .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. M. le Marquis .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nThis was all that poor, bewildered Hector could stammer: his\nslowly-moving brain was torn between the duties of his position and his\nrespect for M. le Marquis, and in the struggle the worthy man was\nenduring throes of anxiety.\n\nFortunately M. le Comte himself put an end to Hector's dilemma. He had\nrecognised St. Genis' voice. Unlike his majordomo, he knew at once that\nsomething terribly grave must have happened, else the young man would\nnever have committed such a serious breach of good manners. And M. le\nComte himself was never at a loss how to turn any situation to a\ndignified and proper issue: he murmured a quick and courteous apology to\nMme. la Duchesse d'Embrun and a comprehensive one to all his guests,\nthen he hastened to meet St. Genis at the door.\n\nAlready St. Genis had entered. His rough clothes and muddy boots looked\nstrangely in contrast to the immaculate get-up of the Comte's guests,\nbut of this he hardly seemed to be aware. His face was flushed; with his\nright hand he clutched a small riding cane, and his glowering dark eyes\nswept a rapid glance over every one in the room.\n\nAnd to the Comte he said hoarsely: \"I must offer you my humblest\napologies, my dear Comte, for obtruding my very untidy person upon you\nat this hour. I have walked all the way from Grenoble, as I could not\nget a hackney-coach, else I had been here earlier and spared you this\nunpleasantness.\"\n\n\"You are always welcome in this house, my good Maurice,\" said the Comte\nin his loftiest manner, \"and at any hour of the day.\"\n\nAnd he added with a certain tone of dignified reproach: \"I did ask you\nto be my guest to-night, if you remember.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said St. Genis, \"was churlish enough to refuse. I would not\nhave come now only that I felt I might be in time to avert the most\nawful catastrophe that has yet fallen upon your house.\"\n\nAgain his restless, dark eyes--sullen and wrathful and charged with a\nlook of rage and of hate--wandered over the assembled company. The look\nfrightened the ladies. They took to clinging to one another, standing in\ncompact little groups together, like frightened birds, watchful and\nwide-eyed. They feared that the young man was mad. But the men exchanged\nsignificant glances and significant smiles. They merely thought that St.\nGenis had been drinking, or that jealousy had half-turned his brain.\n\nOnly Clyffurde, who stood somewhat apart from the others, knew--by some\nunexplainable intuition--what it was that had brought Maurice de St.\nGenis to this house in this excited state and at this hour. He felt\nexcited too, and mightily thankful that the catastrophe would be brought\nabout by others--not by himself.\n\nBut all his thoughts were for Crystal, and an instinctive desire to\nstand by her and to shield her if necessary from some unknown or\nunguessed evil, made him draw nearer to her. She stood on the fringe of\nthe little crowd--as isolated as Bobby was himself.\n\nDe Marmont--whose face had become the colour of dead ashes--had left\nher side: one step at a time and very slowly he was getting nearer and\nnearer to St. Genis, as if the latter's wrath-filled eyes were drawing\nhim against his will.\n\nAt the young man's ominous words, M. le Comte's sunken cheeks grew a\nshade more pale.\n\n\"What catastrophe, _mon Dieu!_\" he exclaimed, \"could fall on my house\nthat would be worse than twenty years of exile?\"\n\n\"An alliance with a traitor, M. le Comte,\" said St. Genis firmly.\n\nA gasp went round the room, a sigh, a cry. The women looked in mute\nhorror from one man to the other, the men already had their right hand\non their swords. But Clyffurde's eyes were fixed upon Crystal, who pale,\nsilent, rigid as a marble statue, with lips parted and nostrils\nquivering, stood not five paces away from him, her dilated eyes\nwandering ceaselessly from the face of St. Genis to that of de Marmont\nand thence to that of her father. But beyond that look of tense\nexcitement she revealed nothing of what she thought and felt.\n\nAlready de Marmont--his hand upon his sword--had advanced menacingly\ntowards St. Genis.\n\n\"M. le Marquis,\" he said between set teeth, \"you will, by God! eat those\nwords, or----\"\n\n\"Eat my words, man?\" retorted St. Genis with a harsh laugh. \"By Heaven!\nhave I not come here on purpose to throw my words into your lying face?\"\n\nThere was a brief but violent skirmish, for de Marmont had made a\nmovement as if he meant to spring at his rival's throat, and G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral\nMarchand and the Vicomte de G\u00c3\u00a9nevois, who happened to be near, had much\nado to seize and hold him: even so they could not stop the hoarse cries\nwhich he uttered:\n\n\"Liar! Liar! Liar! Let me go! Let me get to him! I must kill him! I must\nkill him!\"\n\nThe Comte interposed his dignified person between the two men.\n\n\"Maurice,\" he said, in tones of calm and dispassionate reproof, \"your\nconduct is absolutely unjustifiable. You seem to forget that you are in\nthe presence of ladies and of my guests. If you had a quarrel with M. de\nMarmont. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"A quarrel, my dear Comte?\" exclaimed St. Genis, \"nay, 'tis no quarrel I\nhave with him: and my conduct would have been a thousand times more vile\nif I had not come to-night and stopped his hand from touching that of\nMlle. Crystal de Cambray--his hand which was engaged less than two hours\nago in affixing to the public buildings of Grenoble the infamous message\nof the Corsican brigand to the army and the people of France.\"\n\nA hoarse murmur--a sure sign that men or women are afraid--came from\nevery corner of the room.\n\n\"The message?--What message?\"\n\nSome people turned instinctively to M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet, others to G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral\nMarchand. Every one knew that Bonaparte had landed on the Littoral,\nevery one had heard the rumour that he was marching in triumph through\nProvence and the Dauphin\u00c3\u00a9--but no one had altogether believed this--as\nfor a message--a proclamation--a call to the army--and this in Grenoble\nitself. No one had heard of that--every one had been at home, getting\ndressed for this festive function, thinking of good suppers and of\nwedding bells. It was as if after a clap of thunder and a flash of\nlightning the house was found to be in flames. M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet in answer to\nthese mute queries had shrugged his shoulders, and G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Marchand\nlooked grim and silent.\n\nBut St. Genis with arm uplifted and shaking hand pointed a finger at de\nMarmont.\n\n\"Ask him,\" he cried. \"Ask him, my dear Comte, ask the miserable traitor\nwho with lies and damnable treachery has stolen his way into your\nhouse, has stolen your regard, your hospitality, and was on the point of\nstealing your most precious treasure--your daughter! Ask him! He knows\nevery word of that infamous message by heart! I doubt not but a copy of\nit is inside his coat now. Ask him! G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Mouton-Duveret met him\noutside Grenoble in company with that cur Emery and I saw him with mine\nown eyes distributing these hellish papers among our townspeople and\npinning them up at the street-corners of our city.\"\n\nWhile St. Genis was speaking--or rather screaming--for his voice,\npitched high, seemed to fill the entire room--every glance was fixed\nupon de Marmont. Every one of course expected a contradiction as hot and\nintemperate as was the accusation. It was unthinkable, impossible that\nwhat St. Genis said could be true. They all knew de Marmont well. Nephew\nof the Duc de Raguse who had borne the lion's share in surrendering\nParis to the allies and bringing about the downfall of the Corsican\nusurper, he was one of the most trusted members of the royalist set in\nDauphin\u00c3\u00a9. They had talked quite freely before him, consulted with him\nwhen local Bonapartism appeared uncomfortably rampant. De Marmont was\none of themselves.\n\nAnd yet he said nothing even now when St. Genis accused him and hurled\ninsult upon insult at him:--he said nothing to refute the awful\nimpeachment, to justify his conduct, to explain his companionship with\nEmery. His face was still livid, but it was with rage--not indignation.\nMarchand and G\u00c3\u00a9nevois still held him by the arms, else he and St. Genis\nwould have been at one another's throat before now. But his gestures as\nhe struggled to free himself, the imprecations which he uttered were\nthose of a man who was baffled and found out--not of one who is\ninnocent.\n\nBut as St. Genis continued to speak and worked himself up every moment\ninto a still greater state of excitement, de Marmont gradually seemed to\ncalm down. He ceased to curse: he ceased to struggle, and on his\nface--which still was livid--there gradually crept a look of\ndetermination and of defiance. He dug his teeth into his under lip until\ntiny drops of blood appeared at the corner of his mouth and trickled\nslowly down his chin.\n\nMarchand and G\u00c3\u00a9nevois relaxed the grip upon his arms, since he no longer\nfought, and thus released he contrived to pull himself together. He\ntossed back his head and looked his infuriated accuser boldly in the\nface.\n\nBy the time St. Genis paused in his impassioned denunciation, he had\nhimself completely under control: only his eyes appeared to glow with an\nunnatural fire, and little beads of moisture appeared upon his brow and\nmatted the dark hair against his forehead. The Comte de Cambray at this\njuncture would certainly have interposed with one of those temperate\nspeeches, full of dignity and brimming over with lofty sentiments, which\nhe knew so well how to deliver, but de Marmont gave him no time to\nbegin. When St. Genis paused for breath, he suddenly freed himself\ncompletely with a quick movement, from Marchand's and G\u00c3\u00a9nevois' hold;\nand then he turned to the Comte and to the rest of the company:\n\n\"And what if I did pin the Emperor's proclamation on the walls of\nGrenoble,\" he said proudly and with a tremor of enthusiasm in his voice,\n\"the Emperor, whom treachery more vile than any since the days of the\nIscariot sent into humiliation and exile! The Emperor has come back!\"\ncried the young devotee with that extraordinary fervour which Napoleon\nalone--of all men that have ever walked upon this earth--was able to\nsuscitate: \"his Imperial eagles once more soar over France carrying on\ntheir wings her honour and glory to the outermost corners of Europe. His\nproclamation is to his people who have always loved him, to his\nsoldiers who in their hearts have always been true to him. His\nproclamation?\" he added as with a kind of exultant war-cry he drew a\nroll of paper from his pocket and held it out at arm's length above his\nhead, \"his proclamation? Here it is! Vive l'Empereur! by the grace of\nGod!\"\n\nWho shall attempt to describe the feelings of all those who were\nassembled round this young enthusiast as he hurled his challenge right\nin the face of those who called him a liar and a traitor? Surely it were\na hard task for the chronicler to search into the minds and hearts of\nthis score of men and women--who worshipped one God and reverenced one\nKing--at the moment when they saw that King threatened upon his throne,\ntheir faith mocked and their God blasphemed: that the young man spoke\nwords of truth no one thought of denying. Napoleon's name had the power\nto strike terror in the heart of every citizen who desired peace above\nall things and of every royalist who wished to see King Louis in\npossession of the throne of his fathers. But the army which had fought\nunder him, the army which he had led in triumph and to victory from one\nend of the Continent of Europe to the other, that army still loved him\nand had never been rightly loyal to King Louis. The horrors of war which\nhad lain so heavily over France and over Europe for the past twenty\nyears were painfully vivid still in everybody's mind, and all these\nhorrors were intimately associated with the name which stood out now in\nbold characters on the paper which de Marmont was triumphantly waving.\n\nM. le Comte had become a shade or two paler than he had been before: he\nlooked very old, very careworn, all of a sudden, and his pale eyes had\nthat look in them which comes into the eyes of the old after years of\nsorrow and of regret.\n\nBut never for a moment did he depart from his attitude of dignity. When\nde Marmont's exultant cry of \"Vive l'Empereur!\" had ceased to echo round\nthe majestic walls of this stately ch\u00c3\u00a2teau, he straightened out his\nspare figure and with one fine gesture begged for silence from his\nguests.\n\nThen he said very quietly: \"M. Marmont, this is neither the place nor\nthe opportunity which I should have chosen for confronting you with all\nthe lies which you have told in the past ten months ever since you\nentered my house as an honoured guest. But M. de St. Genis has left me\nno option. Burning with indignation at your treachery he came hot-foot\nto unmask you, before my daughter's fair hand had affixed her own\nhonourable name beneath that of a cheat and a traitor. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Yes! M. de\nMarmont,\" he reiterated with virile force, breaking in on the hot\nprotests which had risen to the young man's lips, \"no one but a cheat\nand a traitor could thus have wormed himself into the confidence of an\nold man and of a young girl! No one but a villainous blackguard could\nhave contemplated the abominable deceptions which you have planned\nagainst me and against my daughter.\"\n\nFor a moment or two after the old man had finished speaking Victor de\nMarmont remained silent. There were murmurs of indignation among the\nguests, also of approval of the Comte's energetic words. De Marmont was\nin the midst of a hostile crowd and he knew it. Here was no drawing-room\nquarrel which could be settled at the point of a sword. Though--as Fate\nand man so oft ordain it--a woman was the primary reason for the\nquarrel, she was not its cause; and the hostility expressed against him\nby every glance which de Marmont encountered was so general and so\ngreat, that it overawed him even in the midst of his enthusiasm.\n\n\"M. le Comte,\" he said at last, and he made a great effort to appear\nindifferent and unconcerned, \"I wish for your daughter's sake that M.\nde St. Genis had chosen some other time to make this fracas. We who have\nlearned chivalry at the Emperor's school would have hit our enemy when\nhe was in a position to defend himself. This, obviously, I cannot do at\nthis moment without trespassing still further upon your hospitality, and\ncausing Mlle. Crystal still more pain. I might even make a direct appeal\nto her, since the decision in this matter rests, I imagine, primarily\nwith her, but with the Emperor at our gates, with the influence of his\npower and of his pride dominating my every thought, I will with your\ngracious permission relieve you of my unwelcome presence without taking\nanother leaf out of M. de St. Genis' book.\"\n\n\"As you will, Monsieur,\" said the Comte stiffly.\n\nDe Marmont bowed quite ceremoniously to him, and the Comte--courtly and\ncorrect to the last--returned his salute with equal ceremony. Then the\nyoung man turned to Crystal.\n\nFor the first time, perhaps, since the terrible fracas had begun, he\nrealised what it all must mean to her. She did not try to evade his\nlook, or to turn away from him. On the contrary she looked him straight\nin the face, and watched him while he approached her, without retreating\none single step. But she watched him just as one would watch an abject\nand revolting cur, that was too vile and too mean even to merit a kick.\n\nCrystal's blue eyes were always expressive, but they had never been so\nexpressive as they were just then. De Marmont met her glance squarely,\nand he read in it everything that she meant to convey--her contempt, her\nloathing, her hatred--but above all her contempt. So overwhelming, so\ncomplete was this contempt that it made him wince, as if he had been\nstruck in the face with a whip.\n\nHe stood still, for he knew that she would never allow him to kiss her\nhand in farewell, and he had had enough of insults--he knew that he\ncould not bear that final one.\n\nA red mist suddenly gathered before his eyes, a mad desire to strike, to\nwound or to kill, and with it a wave of passion--he called it Love--for\nthis woman, such as he had never felt for her before. He gave her back\nwith a glance, hatred for hatred, but whereas her hatred for him was\nsmothered in contempt, his for her was leavened with a fierce and\ndominant passion.\n\nAll this had taken but a few seconds in accomplishment. M. le Comte had\nnot done more than give a sign to Hector to see M. de Marmont safely out\nof the castle, and Maurice de St. Genis had only had time to think of\ninterposing, if de Marmont tried to take Crystal's hand.\n\nOnly a few seconds, but a lifetime of emotion was crammed into them.\nThen de Marmont, with Crystal's look of loathing still eating into his\nsoul, caught sight of Clyffurde who stood close by--Clyffurde whose one\nthought throughout all this unhappy scene had been of Crystal, who\nthrough it all had eyes and ears only for her.\n\nSome kind of instinct made the young girl look up to him just then:\nprobably only in response to a wave of memory which brought back to her\nat that very moment, the words of devotion and offer of service which he\nhad spoken awhile ago; or it may have been that same sense which had\ntold her at the time that here was a man whom she could always trust,\nthat he would always prove a friend, as he had promised, and the look\nwhich she gave him was one of simple confidence.\n\nBut de Marmont just happened to intercept that look. He had never been\njealous of Clyffurde of course. Clyffurde--the foreigner, the bourgeois\ntradesman--never could under any circumstances be a rival to reckon\nwith. At any other time he would have laughed at the idea of Mlle.\nCrystal de Cambray bestowing the slightest favour upon the Englishman.\nBut within the last few seconds everything had become different. Victor\nde Marmont, the triumphant and wealthy suitor of Mlle. de Cambray, had\nbecome a pariah among all these ladies and gentlemen, and he had become\na man scorned by the woman whom he had wooed and thought to win so\neasily.\n\nThe fierce love engendered for Crystal in his turbulent heart by all the\nhatred and all the scorn which she lavished upon him, brought an\nunreasoning jealousy into being. He felt suddenly that he detested\nClyffurde. He remembered Clyffurde's nationality and its avowed hatred\nof the hero whom he--de Marmont--worshipped. And he realised also that\nthat same hatred must of necessity be a bond between the Englishman and\nCrystal de Cambray.\n\nTherefore--though this new untamed jealousy seized hold of him with\nextraordinary power, though it brought that ominous red film before his\neyes, which makes a man strike out blindly and stupidly against his\nrival, it also suggested to de Marmont a far simpler and far more\nefficacious way of ridding himself once for all of any fear of rivalry\nfrom Clyffurde.\n\nWhen he had bowed quite formally to Crystal he looked up at Bobby and\ngave him a pleasant and friendly nod.\n\n\"I suppose you will be coming with me, my good Clyffurde,\" he said\nlightly, \"we are rowing in the same boat, you and I. We were a very\nhappy party, were we not? you and Emery and I when G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Mouton met us\noutside Grenoble: for we had just heard the glorious news that the\nEmperor is marching triumphantly through France.\"\n\nThen he turned once more to St. Genis: \"Did not,\" he said, \"the\nGeneral's aide-de-camp tell you that, M. de St. Genis?\"\n\nSt. Genis had--during these few seconds while de Marmont held the centre\nof the stage--succeeded in controlling his excitement, at any rate\noutwardly. He was so absolutely master of the situation and had put his\nsuccessful rival so completely to rout, that the sense of satisfaction\nhelped to soothe his nerves: and when de Marmont spoke directly to him,\nhe was able to reply with comparative calm.\n\n\"Had you,\" he said to de Marmont, \"attempted to deny the accusation\nwhich I have brought against you, I was ready to confront you with the\nreport which G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Mouton's aide-de-camp brought into the town.\"\n\n\"I had no intention of denying my loyalty to the Emperor,\" rejoined de\nMarmont, \"but I would like to know what report G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Mouton's\naide-de-camp brought into Grenoble. The worthy General did not belie his\nname, I assure you, he looked mightily scared when he recognised Emery.\"\n\n\"He was alone with his aide-de-camp and in his coach,\" retorted St.\nGenis, \"whilst that traitor Emery, you and your friend Mr. Clyffurde\nwere on horseback--you gave him the slip easily enough.\"\n\n\"That's true, of course,\" said de Marmont simply. \"Well, shall we go, my\ndear Clyffurde?\"\n\nHe had accomplished the purpose of his jealousy even more effectually\nthan he could have wished. He looked round and saw that everyone had\nthrown a casual glance of contempt upon Clyffurde and then turned away\nto murmur with scornful indifference: \"I always mistrusted that man.\"\nOr: \"The Comte ought never to have had the fellow in the house,\" while\nthe words: \"English spy!\" and \"Informer\" were on every lip.\n\nBut Clyffurde had made no movement during this brief colloquy. He\nsaw--just as de Marmont did--that everyone was listening more with\nindifference than with horror. He--the stranger--was of so little\nconsequence after all!--a tradesman and an Englishman--what mattered\nwhat his political convictions were? De Marmont was an object of\nhatred, but he--Clyffurde--was only one of contempt.\n\nHe heard the muttered words: \"English spy!\" \"Informer!\" and others of\nstill more overwhelming disdain. But he cared little what these people\nsaid. He knew that they would never trouble to hear any justification\nfrom himself--they would not worry their heads about him a moment longer\nonce he had left the house in company with de Marmont.\n\nHe was not quite sure either whether de Marmont's spite had been\ndirected against himself, personally, or that it was merely the outcome\nof his present humiliating position.\n\nM. le Comte had not bestowed more than a glance upon him and that from\nunder haughtily raised brows and across half the width of the room: but\nCrystal had looked up to him, and was still looking, and it was that\nlook which had driven all the blood from Clyffurde's face and caused his\nlips to set closely as if with a sense of physical pain.\n\nThe insults which her father's guests were overtly murmuring, she had in\nher mind and her eyes were conveying them to him far more plainly than\nher lips could have done:\n\n\"English spy--traitor to friendship and to trust--liar, deceiver,\nhypocrite.\" That and more did her scornful glance imply. But she said\nnothing. He tried to plead with eyes as expressive as were her own, and\nshe merely turned away from him, just as if he no longer existed. She\ndrew her skirt closer round her and somehow with that gesture she seemed\nto sweep him entirely out of her existence.\n\nEven Mme. la Duchesse had not one glance for him. To these passionate,\nhot-headed, impulsive royalists, an adherent of the Corsican ogre was\nlower than the scum of the earth. They loathed de Marmont because he had\nbeen one of themselves: he was a traitor, and not one man there but\nwould have liked to see him put up against a wall and summarily shot.\nBut the stranger they wiped out of their lives.\n\nWas there any chance for Clyffurde, if he tried to defend himself? None\nof a certainty. He could not call the accusation a lie, since he had\nbeen in the company of Emery and of de Marmont most of the day, and mere\nexplanations would have fallen on deaf and unwilling ears.\n\nClyffurde knew this, nor did he attempt any explanation. There is a\ncertain pride in the heart of every English gentleman which in moments\nof acute crisis rises to its full power and height. That pride would not\nallow Clyffurde to utter a single word in his own defence. The futility\nof attempting it also influenced his decision. He scorned the idea of\nspeaking on his own behalf, words which were doomed to be disbelieved.\n\nIn a moment he had found himself absolutely isolated in the centre of\nthe room, not far from the hearth where he had stood a little while ago\ntalking to Crystal, and close to the chair where she had sat with the\nlight of the fire playing upon her satin gown. The cushions still bore\nthe impress of her young figure as she had leaned up against them: the\nsight of it was an additional pain which almost made Clyffurde wince.\n\nHe bowed silently and very low to Crystal and to Mme. la Duchesse, and\nthen to all the ladies and gentlemen who cold-shouldered him with such\ncontemptuous ostentation. De Marmont with head erect and an air of\nswagger was already waiting for him at the door. Clyffurde in taking\nleave of M. le Comte made a violent effort to say at any rate the one\nword which weighed upon his heart.\n\n\"Will you at least permit me, M. le Comte,\" he said, \"to thank you for\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nBut already the Comte had interrupted him, even before the words were\nclearly out of his mouth.\n\n\"I will not permit you, Sir,\" he broke in firmly, \"to speak a single\nword other than a plain denial of M. de St. Genis' accusations against\nyou.\"\n\nThen as Clyffurde relapsed into silence, M. le Comte continued with\nhaughty peremptoriness:\n\n\"A plain 'yes' or 'no' will suffice, Sir. Were you or were you not in\nthe company of those traitors Emery and de Marmont when G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral\nMouton-Duvernet came upon them outside Grenoble?\"\n\n\"I was,\" replied Clyffurde simply.\n\nWith a stiff nod of the head the Comte turned his back abruptly upon\nhim; no one took any further notice of the \"English spy.\" The accused\nhad been condemned without enquiry and without trial. In times like\nthese all one's friends must be above suspicion. Clyffurde knew that\nthere was nothing to be said. With a quickly suppressed sigh, he too\nturned away and in his habitual, English, dogged way he resolutely set\nhis teeth, and with a firm soldierly step walked quietly out of the\nroom.\n\n\"Hector, see that M. de Marmont's coach is ready for him,\" said M. le\nComte with well assumed indifference; \"and that supper is no longer\ndelayed.\"\n\nHe then once more offered his arm to Mme. la Duchesse d'Embrun. \"Mme. la\nDuchesse,\" he said in his most courtly manner, \"I beg that you will\naccept my apologies for this unforeseen interruption. May I have the\nhonour of conducting you to supper?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE EMPRESS' MILLIONS\n\n\nI\n\nDe Marmont, having successfully shot his poisoned arrow and brought down\nhis enemy, had no longer any ill-feeling against Clyffurde. His jealousy\nhad been short-lived; it was set at rest by the brief episode which had\nculminated in the Englishman's final exit from the Castle of Brestalou.\n\nNot a single detail of that moving little episode had escaped de\nMarmont's keen eyes: he had seen Crystal's look of positive abhorrence\nwherewith she had regarded Clyffurde, he had seen the gathering up of\nher skirts away--as it were--from the contaminating propinquity of the\n\"English spy.\"\n\nAnd de Marmont was satisfied.\n\nHe was perfectly ready to pick up the strained strands of friendship\nwith the Englishman and affected not to notice the latter's absorption\nand moodiness.\n\n\"Can I drive you into Grenoble, my good Clyffurde?\" he asked airily as\nhe paused on the top of the perron steps, waiting for the hackney coach.\n\n\"I thank you,\" replied Clyffurde; \"I prefer to walk.\"\n\n\"It is eight kilometres and a pitch-dark night.\"\n\n\"I know my way, I thank you.\"\n\n\"Just as you like.\"\n\nHe paused a moment, and began humming the \"Marseillaise.\" Clyffurde\nstarted walking down the monumental steps.\n\n\"Well, I'll say 'good-night,' de Marmont,\" he said coldly. \"And\n'good-bye,' too.\"\n\n\"You are not going away?\" queried the other.\n\n\"As soon as I can get the means of going.\"\n\n\"Troops will be on the move all over the country soon. Foreigners will\nbe interned. You will have some difficulty in getting away.\"\n\n\"I know that. That's why I want to make arrangements as early as\npossible.\"\n\n\"Where will you stay in the meanwhile?\"\n\n\"Possibly at the 'Trois-Dauphins' if I can get a room.\"\n\n\"I shall see you again then. The Emperor will stay there while he is in\nGrenoble. Well, good-night, my dear friend,\" said de Marmont, as he\nextended a cordial hand to Clyffurde, who, in the dark, evidently failed\nto see it. \"And don't take the insults of all these fools too much to\nheart.\" And he gave an expressive nod in the direction of the stately\ncastle behind him.\n\n\"They are dolts,\" he continued airily; \"if they possessed a grain of\nsense they would have kept on friendly terms with me. As that old fool's\nson-in-law I could have saved him from all the reprisals which will\ninevitably fall on all these royalist traitors, now that the Emperor has\ncome into his own again.\"\n\nClyffurde was half-way down the stone steps when these words of de\nMarmont struck upon his ear. Instinctively he retraced his steps. There\nwas a suggestion of impending danger to Crystal in what the young man\nhad said.\n\n\"What do you mean by talking about reprisals?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. only the inevitable,\" replied de Marmont. \"The people of the\nDauphin\u00c3\u00a9 never cared for these royalists, you know .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and didn't\nlearn to like them any better in these past eleven months since the\nRestoration. M. le Comte de Cambray has been very high and mighty since\nhis return from exile. He may yet come to wish that he had never quitted\nthe comfortable little provincial town in England where he gave drawing\nlessons and French lessons to some very bourgeois boys. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. But here's\nthat coach at last!\" he continued with that jaunty air which he had\nassumed since turning his back upon the reception halls of Brestalou.\n\"Are you sure that you would rather walk than drive with me?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Clyffurde abruptly, \"I am not sure. Thank you very much. I\nthink that if you don't object to my somewhat morose company I would\nlike a lift as far as Grenoble.\"\n\nHe wanted to make de Marmont talk, to hear what the young man had to\nsay. From it he thought that he could learn more accurately what danger\nwould threaten Brestalou in the event of Napoleon's successful march to\nParis.\n\nThat the great adventurer's triumph would be short-lived Clyffurde was\nperfectly sure. He knew the temper of England and believed in the\nmilitary genius of Wellington. England would never tolerate for a moment\nlonger than she could help that the firebrand of Europe should once more\nsit upon the throne of France, and unless the allies had greatly altered\ntheir policy in the past ten months and refused England the necessary\nsupport, Wellington would be more than a match for the decimated army of\nBonaparte.\n\nBut a few weeks--months, perhaps, might elapse before Napoleon was once\nagain put entirely out of action--and this time more completely and more\neffectually than with a small kingdom wherein to dream again of European\nconquests; during those weeks and months Brestalou and its inhabitants\nwould be at the mercy of the man from Corsica--the island of unrest and\nof never sleeping vendetta.\n\nDe Marmont was ready enough to talk. He knew nothing, of course, of\nNapoleon's plans and ideas save what Emery had told him. But what he\nlacked in knowledge he more than made up in imagination. Excitement too\nhad made him voluble. He talked freely and incessantly: \"The Emperor\nwould do this. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. The Emperor will never tolerate that .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" was all\nthe time on his lips.\n\nHe bragged and he swaggered, launched into passionate eulogies of the\nEmperor, and fiery denunciations of his enemies. Berthier, Clark,\nFoucher, de Marmont, they all deserved death. Ney alone was to be\npardoned, for Ney was a fine soldier--always supposing that Ney would\nrepent. But men like the Comte de Cambray were a pest in any\ncountry--mischief-making and intriguing. Bah! the Emperor will never\ntolerate them.\n\nSuddenly Clyffurde--who had become half-drowsy, lulled to somnolence by\nde Marmont's incessant chatter and the monotonous jog-trot of the\nhorses--woke to complete consciousness. He pricked his ears and in a\nmoment was all attention.\n\n\"They think that they can deceive me,\" de Marmont was saying airily.\n\"They think that I am as great a fool as they are, with their talk of\nMme. la Duchesse's journey north, directly after the wedding! Bah! any\ndolt can put two and two together: the Comte tells me in one breath that\nhe had a visit from Fourier in the afternoon, and that the Duchesse--who\nonly arrived in Brestalou yesterday--would leave again for Paris on the\nday after to-morrow, and he tells it me with a mysterious air, and adds\na knowing wink, and a promise that he would explain himself more fully\nlater on. I could have laughed--if it were not all so miserably stupid.\"\n\nHe paused for want of breath and tried to peer through the window of the\ncoach.\n\n\"It is pitch-dark,\" he said, \"but we can't be very far from the city\nnow.\"\n\n\"I don't see,\" rejoined Clyffurde, ostentatiously smothering a yawn,\n\"what M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet's visit to Brestalou had to do with the Duchesse's\njourney to the north. You have got intrigues on the brain, my good de\nMarmont.\"\n\nAnd with well-feigned indifference, he settled himself more cosily into\nthe dark corner of the carriage.\n\nDe Marmont laughed. \"What Fourier's afternoon visit has to do with Mme.\nd'Agen's journey?\" he retorted, \"I'll tell you, my good Clyffurde.\nFourier went to see M. le Comte de Cambray this afternoon because he is\na poltroon. He is terrified at the thought that the unfortunate Empress'\nmoney and treasure are still lying in the cellars of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville\nand he went out to Brestalou in order to consult with the Comte what had\nbest be done with the money.\"\n\n\"I didn't know the ex-Empress' money was lying in the cellar of the\nH\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville,\" remarked Clyffurde with well-assumed indifference.\n\n\"Nor did I until Emery told me,\" rejoined de Marmont. \"The money is\nthere though: stolen from the Empress Marie Louise by that\narch-intriguer Talleyrand. Twenty-five millions in notes and drafts! the\nEmperor reckons on it for current expenses until he has reached Paris\nand taken over the Treasury.\"\n\n\"Even then I don't see what Mme. la Duchesse d'Agen has to do with it.\"\n\n\"You don't,\" said de Marmont drily: \"but I did in a moment. Fourier\nwouldn't keep the money at the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville: the Comte de Cambray\nwould not allow it to be deposited in his house. They both want the\nBourbon to have it. So--in order to lull suspicion--they have decided\nthat Madame la Duchesse shall take the money to Paris.\"\n\n\"Well!--perhaps!--\" said Clyffurde with a yawn. \"But are we not in\nGrenoble yet?\"\n\nOnce more he lapsed into silence, closed his eyes and to all intents and\npurposes fell asleep, for never another word did de Marmont get out of\nhim, until Grenoble was reached and the rue Montorge.\n\nHere de Marmont had his lodgings, three doors from the \"H\u00c3\u00b4tel des\nTrois-Dauphins,\" where fortunately Clyffurde managed to secure a\ncomfortable room for himself.\n\nHe parted quite amicably from de Marmont, promising to call in upon him\nin the morning. It would be foolish to quarrel with that young wind-bag\nnow. He knew some things, and talked of a great many more.\n\n\nII\n\nPreparations against the arrival of the Corsican ogre were proceeding\napace. G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Marchand had been overconfident throughout the day--which\nwas the 5th of March: \"The troops,\" he said, \"were loyal to a man. They\nwere coming in fast from Chamb\u00c3\u00a9ry and Vienne; the garrison would and\ncould repulse that band of pirates, and take upon itself to fulfil the\npromise which Ney had made to the King--namely to bring the ogre to His\nMajesty bound and gagged in an iron cage.\"\n\nBut the following day, which was the 6th, many things occurred to shake\nthe Commandant's confidence: Napoleon's proclamation was not only posted\nup all over the town, but the citizens were distributing the printed\nleaflets among themselves: one of the officers on the staff pointed out\nto G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Marchand that the 4th regiment of artillery quartered in\nGrenoble was the one in which Bonaparte had served as a lieutenant\nduring the Revolution--the men, it was argued, would never turn their\narms against one whom they had never ceased to idolize: it would not be\nsafe to march out into the open with men whose loyalty was so very\ndoubtful.\n\nThere was a rumour current in the town that when the men of the 5th\nregiment of engineers and the 4th of artillery were told that Napoleon\nhad only eleven hundred men with him, they all murmured with one accord:\n\"And what about us?\"\n\nTherefore G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Marchand, taking all these facts into consideration,\nmade up his mind to await the ogre inside the walls of Grenoble. Here at\nany rate defections and desertions would be less likely to occur than in\nthe field. He set to work to organise the city into a state of defence;\nforty-seven guns were put in position upon the ramparts which dominate\nthe road to the south, and he sent a company of engineers and a\nbattalion of infantry to blow up the bridge of Ponthaut at La Mure.\n\nThe royalists in the city, who were beginning to feel very anxious, had\nassembled in force to cheer these troops as they marched out of the\ncity. But the attitude of the sapeurs created a very unpleasant\nimpression: they marched out in disorder, some of them tore the white\ncockade from their shakos, and one or two cries of \"Vive l'Empereur!\"\nwere distinctly heard in their ranks.\n\nAt La Mure, M. le Maire argued very strongly against the destruction of\nthe bridge of Ponthaut: \"It would be absurd,\" he said, \"to blow up a\nvaluable bridge, since not one kilometre away there was an excellent\nford across which Napoleon could march his troops with perfect ease.\"\nThe sapeurs murmured an assent, and their officer, Colonel Delessart,\nfeeling the temper of his men, did not dare insist.\n\nHe quartered them at La Mure to await the arrival of the infantry, and\nfurther orders from G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Marchand. When the 5th regiment of infantry\nwas reported to have reached Laffray, Delessart had the sapeurs out and\nmarched out to meet them, although it was then close upon midnight.\n\nWhile Delessart and his troops encamped at Laffray, Cambronne--who was\nin command of Napoleon's vanguard--himself occupied La Mure. This was on\nthe 7th. The Mayor--who had so strongly protested against the\ndestruction of the bridge of Ponthaut--gathered the population around\nhim, and in a body men, women and children marched out of the borough\nalong the Corps-Sisteron road in order to give \"the Emperor\" a rousing\nwelcome.\n\nIt was still early morning. Napoleon at the head of his Old Guard\nentered La Mure; a veritable ovation greeted him, everyone pressed round\nhim to see him or touch his horse, his coat, his stirrups; he spoke to\nthe people and held the Mayor and municipal officials in long\nconversation.\n\nJust as practically everywhere else on his route, he had won over every\nheart; but his small column which had been eleven hundred strong when he\nlanded at Jouan, was still only eleven hundred strong: he had only\nrallied four recruits to his standard. True, he had met with no\nopposition, true that the peasantry of the Dauphin\u00c3\u00a9 had loudly acclaimed\nhim, had listened to his harangues and presented him with flowers, but\nhe had not had a single encounter with any garrison on his way, nor\ncould he boast of any defections in his favour; now he was nearing\nGrenoble--Grenoble, which was strongly fortified and well\ngarrisoned--and Grenoble would be the winning or losing cast of this\ngreat gamble for the sovereignty of France.\n\nIt was close on eleven when the great adventurer set out upon this\nmomentous stage of his journey: the Polish Lancers leading, then the\nchasseurs of his Old Guard with their time-worn grey coats and heavy\nbear-skins; some of them were on foot, others packed closely together in\nwagons and carts which the enthusiastic agriculturists of La Mure had\nplaced at the disposal of \"the Emperor.\"\n\nNapoleon himself followed in his coach, his horse being led along.\nAmidst thundering cries of \"God speed\" the small column started on its\nway.\n\nAs for the rest, 'tis in the domain of history; every phase of it has\nbeen put on record:--Delessart--worried in his mind that he had not been\nable to obey G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Marchand's orders and destroy the bridge of\nPonthaut--his desire to communicate once more with the General; his\ndecision to await further orders and in the meanwhile to occupy the\nnarrow defile of Laffray as being an advantageous position wherein to\noppose the advance of the ogre: all this on the one side.\n\nOn the other, the advance of the Polish Lancers, of the carts and wagons\nwherein are crowded the soldiers of the Old Guard, and Napoleon himself,\nthe great gambler, sitting in his coach gazing out through the open\nwindows at the fair land of France, the peaceful valley on his left, the\nchain of ice-covered lakes and the turbulent Drac; on his right beyond\nthe hills frowning Taillefer, snow-capped and pine-clad, and far ahead\nGrenoble still hidden from his view as the future too was still\nhidden--the mysterious gate beyond which lay glory and an Empire or the\nignominy of irretrievable failure.\n\nHistory has made a record of it all, and it is not the purpose of this\ntrue chronicle to do more than recall with utmost brevity the chief\nincident of that memorable encounter, the Polish Lancers galloping back\nwith the report that the narrow pass was held against them in strong\nforce: the Old Guard climbing helter-skelter out of carts and wagons,\nexamining their arms, making ready: Napoleon stepping quickly out of his\ncoach and mounting his charger.\n\nOn the other side Delessart holding hurried consultation with the\nVicomte de St. Genis whom G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Marchand has despatched to him with\norders to shoot the brigand and his horde as he would a pack of wolves.\n\nNapoleon is easily recognisable in the distance, with his grey overcoat,\nhis white horse and his bicorne hat; presently he dismounts and walks up\nand down across the narrow road, evidently in a state of great mental\nagitation.\n\nDelessart's men are sullen and silent; a crowd of men and women from\nGrenoble have followed them up thus far; they work their way in and out\namong the infantrymen: they have printed leaflets in their hands which\nthey cram one by one into the hands or pockets of the soldiers--copies\nof Napoleon's proclamation.\n\nNow an officer of the Old Guard is seen to ride up the pass. Delessart\nrecognises him. They were brothers in arms two years ago and served\ntogether under the greatest military genius the world has ever known.\nNapoleon has sent the man on as an emissary, but Delessart will not\nallow him to speak.\n\n\"I mean to do my duty,\" he declares.\n\nBut in his voice too there has already crept that note of sullenness\nwhich characterised the sapeurs from the first.\n\nThen Captain Raoul, own aide-de-camp to Napoleon, comes up at full\ngallop: nor does he draw rein till he is up with the entire front of\nDelessart's battalion.\n\n\"Your Emperor is coming,\" he shouts to the soldiers, \"if you fire, the\nfirst shot will reach him: and France will make you answerable for this\noutrage!\"\n\nWhile he shouts and harangues the men are still sullen and silent. And\nin the distance the lances of the Polish cavalry gleam in the sun, and\nthe shaggy bear-skins of the Old Guard are seen to move forward up the\npass. Delessart casts a rapid piercing glance over his men. Sullenness\nhad given place to obvious terror.\n\n\"Right about turn! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Quick! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. March!\" he commands.\n\nResistance obviously would be useless with these men, who are on the\nverge of laying down their arms. He forces on a quick march, but the\nPolish Lancers are already gaining ground: the sound of their horses'\nhoofs stamping the frozen ground, the snorting, the clanging of arms is\ndistinctly heard. Delessart now has no option. He must make his men turn\nonce more and face the ogre and his battalion before they are attacked\nin the rear.\n\nAs soon as the order is given and the two little armies stand face to\nface the Polish Lancers halt and the Old Guard stand still.\n\nAnd it almost seems for the moment as if Nature herself stood still and\nlistened, and looked on. The genial midday sun is slowly melting the\nsnow on pine trees and rocks; one by one the glistening tiny crystals\nblink and vanish under the warmth of the kiss; the hard, white road\ndarkens under the thaw and slowly a thin covering of water spreads over\nthe icy crust of the lakes.\n\nNapoleon tells Colonel Mallet to order the men to lower their arms.\nMallet protests, but Napoleon reiterates the command, more peremptorily\nthis time, and Mallet must obey. Then at the head of his old chasseurs,\nthus practically disarmed, the Emperor--and he is every inch an Emperor\nnow--walks straight up to Delessart's opposing troops.\n\nHot-headed St. Genis cries: \"Here he is!--Fire, in Heaven's name!\"\n\nBut the sapeurs--the old regiment in which Napoleon had served as a\nyoung lieutenant in those glorious olden days--are now as pale as death,\ntheir knees shake under them, their arms tremble in their hands.\n\nAt ten paces away from the foremost ranks Napoleon halts:\n\n\"Soldiers,\" he cries loudly. \"Here I am! your Emperor, do you know me?\"\n\nAgain he advances and with a calm gesture throws open his well-worn grey\nredingote.\n\n\"Fire!\" cries St. Genis in mad exasperation.\n\n\"Fire!\" commands Delessart in a voice rendered shaky with overmastering\nemotion.\n\nSilence reigns supreme. Napoleon still advances, step by step, his\nredingote thrown open, his broad chest challenging the first bullet\nwhich would dare to end the bold, adventurous, daring life.\n\n\"Is there one of you soldiers here who wants to shoot his Emperor? If\nthere is, here I am! Fire!\"\n\nWhich of these soldiers who have served under him at Jena and Austerlitz\ncould resist such a call. His voice has lost nothing yet of its charm,\nhis personality nothing of its magic. Ambitious, ruthless, selfish he\nmay be, but to the army, a friend, a comrade as well as a god.\n\nSuddenly the silence is broken. Shouts of \"Vive l'Empereur!\" rend the\nair, they echo down the narrow valley, re-echo from hill to hill and\nreverberate upon the pine-clad heights of Taillefer. Broken are the\nranks, white cockades fly in every direction, tricolours appear in their\nhundreds everywhere. Shakos are waved on the points of the bayonets, and\nalways, always that cry: \"Vive l'Empereur!\"\n\nSapeurs and infantrymen crowd around the little man in the worn grey\nredingote, and he with that rough familiarity which bound all soldiers'\nhearts to him, seizes an old sergeant by the ends of his long moustache:\n\n\"So, you old dog,\" he says, \"you were going to shoot your Emperor, were\nyou?\"\n\n\"Not me,\" replies the man with a growl. \"Look at our guns. Not one of\nthem was loaded.\"\n\nDelessart, in despair yet shaken to the heart, his eyes swimming in\ntears, offers his sword to Napoleon, whereupon the Emperor grasps his\nhand in friendship and comforts him with a few inspiring words.\n\nOnly St. Genis has looked on all this scene with horror and contempt.\nHis royalist opinions are well known, his urgent appeal to Delessart a\nwhile ago to \"shoot the brigand and his hordes\" still rings in every\nsoldier's ear. He is half-crazy with rage and there is quite an element\nof terror in the confused thoughts which crowd in upon his brain.\n\nAlready the sapeurs and infantrymen have joined the ranks of the Old\nGuard, and Napoleon, with that inimitable verve and inspiring eloquence\nof which he was pastmaster, was haranguing his troops. Just then three\nhorsemen, dressed in the uniform of officers of the National Guard and\nwearing enormous tricolour cockades as large as soup-plates on their\nshakos, are seen to arrive at a break-neck gallop down the pass from\nGrenoble.\n\nSt. Genis recognised them at a glance: they were Victor de Marmont,\nSurgeon-Captain Emery and their friend the glovemaker, Dumoulin. The\nnext moment these three men were at the feet of their beloved hero.\n\n\"Sire,\" said Dumoulin the glovemaker, \"in the name of the citizens of\nGrenoble we hereby offer you our services and one hundred thousand\nfrancs collected in the last twenty-four hours for your use.\"\n\n\"I accept both,\" replied the Emperor, while he grasped vigorously the\nhands of his three most devoted friends.\n\nSt. Genis uttered a loud and comprehensive curse: then he pulled his\nhorse abruptly round and with such a jerk that it reared and plunged\nmadly forward ere it started galloping away with its frantic rider in\nthe direction of Grenoble.\n\n\nIII\n\nAnd Grenoble itself was in a turmoil.\n\nIn the barracks the cries of \"Vive l'Empereur!\" were incessant; G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral\nMarchand was indefatigable in his efforts to still that cry, to rouse in\nthe hearts of the soldiers a sense of loyalty to the King.\n\n\"Your country and your King,\" he shouted from barrack-room to\nbarrack-room.\n\n\"Our country and our Emperor!\" responded the soldiers with ever-growing\nenthusiasm.\n\nThe spirit of the army and of the people were Bonapartist to the core.\nThey had never trusted either Marchand or pr\u00c3\u00a9fet Fourier, who had turned\ntheir coats so readily at the Restoration: they hated the \u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9s--the\nComte de Cambray, the Vicomte de St. Genis, the Duc d'Embrun--with their\nold-fashioned ideas of the semi-divine rights of the nobility second\nonly to the godlike ones of the King. They thought them arrogant and\nuntamed, over-ready to grab once more all the privileges which a bloody\nRevolution had swept away.\n\nTo them Napoleon, despite the brilliant days of the Empire, despite his\nautocracy, his militarism and his arrogance, represented \"the people,\"\nthe advanced spirit of the Revolution; his downfall had meant a return\nto the old regime--the regime of feudal rights, of farmers general, of\nheavy taxation and dear bread.\n\n\"Vive l'Empereur!\" was cried in the barracks and \"Vive l'Empereur!\" at\nthe street corners.\n\nA squadron of Hussars had marched into Grenoble from Vienne just before\nnoon: the same squadron which a few months ago at a revue by the Comte\nd'Artois in the presence of the King had shouted \"Vive l'Empereur!\" What\nfaith could be put in their loyalty now?\n\nBut two infantry regiments came in at the same time from Chamb\u00c3\u00a9ry and on\nthese G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Marchand hoped to be able to reckon. The Comte Charles de\nla B\u00c3\u00a9doy\u00c3\u00a8re was in command of the 7th regiment, and though he had served\nin Prussia under Napoleon he had tendered his oath loyally to Louis\nXVIII. at the Restoration. He was a tried and able soldier and Marchand\nbelieved in him. The General himself reviewed both infantry regiments on\nthe Place d'Armes on their arrival, and then posted them upon the\nramparts of the city, facing direct to the southeast and dominating the\nroad to La Mure.\n\nDe la B\u00c3\u00a9doy\u00c3\u00a8re remained in command of the 7th.\n\nFor two hours he paced the ramparts in a state of the greatest possible\nagitation. The nearness of Napoleon, of the man who had been his comrade\nin arms first and his leader afterwards, had a terribly disturbing\neffect upon his spirit. From below in the city the people's mutterings,\ntheir grumbling, their sullen excitement seemed to rise upwards like an\nintoxicating incense. The attitude of the troops, of the gunners, as\nwell as of the garrison and of his own regiment, worked more potently\nstill upon the Colonel's already shaken loyalty.\n\nThen suddenly his mind is made up. He draws his sword and shouts: \"Vive\nl'Empereur!\"\n\n\"Soldiers!\" he calls. \"Follow me! I will show you the way to duty!\nFollow me! Vive l'Empereur!\"\n\n\"Vive l'Empereur!\" vociferate the troops.\n\n\"After me, my men! to the Bonne Gate! After me!\" cries De la B\u00c3\u00a9doy\u00c3\u00a8re.\n\nAnd to the shouts of \"Vive l'Empereur!\" the 7th regiment of infantry\npasses through the gate and marches along the streets of the suburb on\ntowards La Mure.\n\nG\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Marchand, hastily apprised of the wholesale defection, sends\nColonel Villiers in hot haste in the wake of De la B\u00c3\u00a9doy\u00c3\u00a8re. Villiers\ncomes up with the latter two kilom\u00c3\u00a8tres outside Grenoble. He talks, he\npersuades, he admonishes, he scolds, De la B\u00c3\u00a9doy\u00c3\u00a8re and his men are\nfirm.\n\n\"Your country and your king!\" shouts Villiers.\n\n\"Our country and our Emperor!\" respond the men. And they go to join the\nOld Guard at Laffray while Villiers in despair rides back into Grenoble.\n\nIn the town the desertion of the 7th has had a very serious effect. The\nmuttered cries of \"Vive l'Empereur!\" are open shouts now. G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral\nMarchand is at his wits' ends. He has ordered the closing of every city\ngate, and still the soldiers in batches of tens and twenties at a time\ncontrive to escape out of the town carrying their arms and in many cases\nbaggage with them. The royalist faction--the women as well as the\nmen--spend the whole day in and out of the barrack-rooms talking to the\nmen, trying to infuse into them loyalty to the King, and to cheer them\nup by bringing them wine and provisions.\n\nIn the afternoon the Vicomte de St. Genis, sick, exhausted, his horse\ncovered with lather, comes back with the story of the pass of Laffray,\nand Napoleon's triumphant march toward Grenoble. Marchand seriously\ncontemplates evacuating the city in order to save the garrison and his\nstores.\n\nPr\u00c3\u00a9fet Fourier congratulates himself on his foresight and on that he has\ntransferred the twenty-five million francs from the cellars of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel\nde Ville into the safe keeping of M. le Comte de Cambray. He and G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral\nMarchand both hope and think that \"the brigand and his horde\" cannot\npossibly be at the gates of Grenoble before the morrow, and that Mme. la\nDuchesse d'Agen would be well on her way to Paris with the money by that\ntime.\n\nMarchand in the meanwhile has made up his mind to retire from the city\nwith his troops. It is only a strategical measure, he argues, to save\nbloodshed and to save his stores, pending the arrival of the Comte\nd'Artois at Lyons, with the army corps. He gives the order for the\ngeneral retreat to commence at two o'clock in the morning.\n\nSatisfied that he has done the right thing, he finally goes back to his\nquarters in the Hotel du Dauphin\u00c3\u00a9 close to the ramparts. The Comte de\nCambray is his guest at dinner, and toward seven o'clock the two men at\nlast sit down to a hurried meal, both their minds filled with\napprehension and not a little fear as to what the next few days will\nbring.\n\n\"It is, of course, only a question of time,\" says the Comte de Cambray\nairily. \"Monseigneur le Comte d'Artois will be at Lyons directly with\nforty thousand men, and he will easily crush that marauding band of\npirates. But this time the Corsican after his defeat must be put more\neffectually out of harm's way. I, personally, was never much in favour\nof Elba.\"\n\n\"The English have some islands out in the Atlantic or the Pacific,\"\nresponds G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Marchand with firm decision. \"It would be safest to\nshoot the brigand, but failing that, let the English send him to one of\nthose islands, and undertake to guard him well.\"\n\n\"Let us drink to that proposition, my dear Marchand,\" concludes M. le\nComte with a smile.\n\nHardly had the two men concluded this toast, when a fearful din is\nheard, \"regular howls\" proceeding from the suburb of Bonne. The windows\nof the hotel give on the ramparts and the house itself dominates the\nBonne Gate and the military ground beyond it. Hastily Marchand jumps up\nfrom the table and throws open the window. He and the Comte step out\nupon the balcony.\n\nThe din has become deafening: with a hand that slightly trembles now\nG\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Marchand points to the extensive grounds that lie beyond the\ncity gate, and M. le Comte quickly smothers an exclamation of terror.\n\nA huge crowd of peasants armed with scythes and carrying torches which\nflicker in the frosty air have invaded the slopes and flats of the\nmilitary zone. They are yelling \"Vive l'Empereur!\" at the top of their\nvoices, and from walls and bastions reverberates the answering cry \"Vive\nl'Empereur!\" vociferated by infantrymen and gunners and sapeurs, and\nechoed and re-echoed with passionate enthusiasm by the people of\nGrenoble assembled in their thousands in the narrow streets which abut\nupon the ramparts.\n\nAnd in the midst of the peasantry, surrounded by them as by a cordon,\nNapoleon and his small army, just reinforced by the 7th regiment of\ninfantry, have halted--expectant.\n\nNapoleon's aide-de-camp, Capitaine Raoul, accompanied by half a dozen\nlancers, comes up to the palisade which bars the immediate approach to\nthe city gates.\n\n\"Open!\" he cries loudly, so loudly that his young, firm voice rises\nabove the tumult around. \"Open! in the name of the Emperor!\"\n\nMarchand sees it all, he hears the commanding summons, hears the\nthunderous and enthusiastic cheers which greet Captain Raoul's call to\nsurrender. He and the Comte de Cambray are still standing upon the\nbalcony of the hotel that faces the gate of Bonne and dominates from its\nhigh ground the ramparts opposite. White-cheeked and silent the two men\nhave gazed before them and have understood. To attempt to stem this tide\nof popular enthusiasm would inevitably be fatal. The troops inside\nGrenoble were as ready to cross over to \"the brigand's\" standard as was\nColonel de la B\u00c3\u00a9doy\u00c3\u00a8re's regiment of infantry.\n\nThe ramparts and the surrounding military zone were lit up by hundreds\nof torches; by their flickering light the two men on the balcony could\nsee the faces of the people, and those of the soldiers who were even now\nbeing ordered to fire upon Raoul and the Lancers.\n\nColonel Roussille, who is in command of the troops at the gate, sends a\nhasty messenger to G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Marchand: \"The brigand demands that we open\nthe gate!\" reports the messenger breathlessly.\n\n\"Tell the Colonel to give the order to fire,\" is Marchand's peremptory\nresponse.\n\n\"Are you coming with me, M. le Comte?\" he asks hurriedly. But he does\nnot wait for a reply. Wrapping his cloak around him, he goes in the wake\nof the messenger. M. le Comte de Cambray is close on his heels.\n\nFive minutes later the General is up on the ramparts. He has thrown a\nquick, piercing glance round him. There are two thousand men up here,\ntwenty guns, ammunition in plenty. Out there only peasants and a\nheterogeneous band of some fifteen hundred men. One shot from a gun\nperhaps would send all that crowd flying, the first fusillade might\nscatter \"the band of brigands,\" but Marchand cannot, dare not give the\npositive order to fire; he knows that rank insubordination, positive\nrefusal to obey would follow.\n\nHe talks to the men, he harangues, he begs them to defend their city\nagainst this \"horde of Corsican pirates.\"\n\nTo every word he says, the men but oppose the one cry: \"Vive\nl'Empereur!\"\n\nThe Comte de Cambray turns in despair to M. de St. Genis, who is a\ncaptain of artillery and whose men had hitherto been supposed to be\ntried and loyal royalists.\n\n\"If the men won't fire, Maurice,\" asks the Comte in despair, \"cannot the\nofficers at least fire the first shot?\"\n\n\"M. le Comte,\" replies St. Genis through set teeth, for his heart was\nfilled with wrath and shame at the defection of his men, \"the gunners\nhave declared that if the officers shoot, the men will shatter them to\npieces with their own batteries.\"\n\nThe crowds outside the gate itself are swelling visibly. They press in\nfrom every side toward the city loudly demanding the surrender of the\ntown. \"Open the gates! open!\" they shout, and their clamour becomes more\ninsistent every moment. Already they have broken down the palisades\nwhich surround the military zone, they pour down the slopes against the\ngate. But the latter is heavy, and massive, studded with iron, stoutly\nresisting axe or pick.\n\n\"Open!\" they cry. \"Open! in the Emperor's name!\"\n\nThey are within hailing distance of the soldiers on the ramparts: \"What\nprice your plums?\" they shout gaily to the gunners.\n\n\"Quite cheap,\" retort the latter with equal gaiety, \"but there's no\ndanger of the Emperor getting any.\"\n\nThe women sing the old couplet:\n\n    \"Bon! Bon! Napol\u00c3\u00a9on\n    Va rentrer dans sa maison!\"\n\nand the soldiers on the ramparts take up the refrain:\n\n    \"Nous allons voir le grand Napol\u00c3\u00a9on\n    Le vainqueur de toutes les nations!\"\n\n\"What can we do, M. le Comte?\" says G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Marchand at last. \"We shall\nhave to give in.\"\n\n\"I'll not stay and see it,\" replies the Comte. \"I should die of shame.\"\n\nEven while the two men are talking and discussing the possibilities of\nan early surrender, Napoleon himself has forced his way through the\ntumultuous throng of his supporters, and accompanied by Victor de\nMarmont and Colonel de la B\u00c3\u00a9doy\u00c3\u00a8re he advances as far as the gate which\nstill stands barred defiantly against him.\n\n\"I command you to open this gate!\" he cries aloud.\n\nColonel Roussille, who is in command, replies defiantly: \"I only take\norders from the General himself.\"\n\n\"He is relieved of his command,\" retorts Napoleon.\n\n\"I know my duty,\" insists Roussille. \"I only take orders from the\nGeneral.\"\n\nVictor de Marmont, intoxicated with his own enthusiasm, maddened with\nrage at sight of St. Genis, whose face is just then thrown into vivid\nlight by the glare of the torches, cries wildly: \"Soldiers of the\nEmperor, who are being forced to resist him, turn on those treacherous\nofficers of yours, tear off their epaulettes, I say!\"\n\nHis shrill and frantic cries seem to precipitate the inevitable climax.\nThe tumult has become absolutely delirious. The soldiers on the ramparts\ntumble over one another in a mad rush for the gate, which they try to\nbreak open with the butt-end of their rifles; but they dare not actually\nattack their own officers, and in any case they know that the keys of\nthe city are still in the hands of G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Marchand, and G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral\nMarchand has suddenly disappeared.\n\nFeeling the hopelessness and futility of further resistance, he has gone\nback to his hotel, and is even now giving orders and making preparations\nfor leaving Grenoble. Pr\u00c3\u00a9fet Fourier, hastily summoned, is with him, and\nthe Comte de Cambray is preparing to return immediately to Brestalou.\n\n\"We shall all leave for Paris to-morrow, as early as possible,\" he says,\nas he finally takes leave of the General and the pr\u00c3\u00a9fet, \"and take the\nmoney with us, of course. If the King--which God forbid!--is obliged to\nleave Paris, it will be most acceptable to him, until the day when the\nallies are once more in the field and ready to crush, irretrievably this\ntime, this Corsican scourge of Europe.\"\n\nOne or two of the royalist officers have succeeded in massing together\nsome two or three hundred men out of several regiments who appear to be\ndetermined to remain loyal.\n\nSt. Genis is not among these: his men had been among the first to cry\n\"Vive l'Empereur!\" when ordered to fire on the brigand and his hordes.\nThey had even gone so far as to threaten their officers' lives.\n\nNow, covered with shame, and boiling with wrath at the defection, St.\nGenis asks leave of the General to escort M. le Comte de Cambray and his\nparty to Paris.\n\n\"We shall be better off for extra protection,\" urges M. le Comte de\nCambray in support of St. Genis' plea for leave. \"I shall only have the\ncoachman and two postillions with me. M. de St. Genis would be of\nimmense assistance in case of footpads.\"\n\n\"The road to Paris is quite safe, I believe,\" says G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Marchand,\n\"and at Lyons you will meet the army of M. le Comte d'Artois. But\nperhaps M. de St. Genis had better accompany you as far as there, at any\nrate. He can then report himself at Lyons. Twenty-five millions is a\nlarge sum, of course, but the purpose of your journey has remained a\nsecret, has it not?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" says M. le Comte unhesitatingly, for he has completely\nerased Victor de Marmont from his mind.\n\n\"Well then, all you need fear is an attack from footpads--and even that\nis unlikely,\" concludes G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Marchand, who by now is in a great hurry\nto go. \"But M. de St. Genis has my permission to escort you.\"\n\nThe General entrusts the keys of the Bonne Gate to Colonel Roussille. He\nhas barely time to execute his hasty flight, having arranged to escape\nout of Grenoble by the St. Laurent Gate on the north of the town. In the\nmeanwhile a carter from the suburb of St. Joseph outside the Bonne Gate\nhas harnessed a team of horses to one of his wagons and brought along a\nhuge joist: twenty pairs of willing and stout arms are already\nmanipulating this powerful engine for the breaking open of the resisting\ngate. Already the doors are giving way, the hinges creak; and while\nG\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Marchand and pr\u00c3\u00a9fet Fourier with their small body of faithful\nsoldiers rush precipitately across the deserted streets of the town,\nColonel Roussille makes ready to open the Gate of Bonne to the Emperor\nand to his soldiers.\n\n\"My regiment was prepared to turn against me,\" he says to his men, \"but\nI shall not turn against them.\"\n\nThen he formally throws open the gate.\n\nEcstatic delight, joyful enthusiasm, succeeds the frantic cries of a\nwhile ago. Napoleon entering the city of Grenoble was nearly crushed to\ndeath by the frenzy of the crowd. Cheered to the echoes, surrounded by\na delirious populace which hardly allowed him to move, it was hours\nbefore he succeeded in reaching the H\u00c3\u00b4tel des Trois-Dauphins, where he\nwas resolved to spend the night, since it was kept by an ex-soldier, one\nof his own Old Guard of the Italian campaign.\n\nThe enthusiasm was kept up all night. The town was illuminated. Until\ndawn men and women paraded the streets singing the \"Marseillaise\" and\nshouting \"Vive l'Empereur!\"\n\nIn a small room, simply furnished but cosy and comfortable, the great\nadventurer, who had conquered half the world and lost it and had now set\nout to conquer it again, sat with half a dozen of his most faithful\nfriends: Cambronne and Raoul, Victor de Marmont and Emery.\n\nOn the table spread out before him was an ordnance map of the province;\nhis clenched hand rested upon it; his eyes, those eagle-like, piercing\neyes which had so often called his soldiers to victory, gazed out\nstraight before him, as if through the bare, white-washed walls of this\nhumble hotel room he saw the vision of the brilliant halls of the\nTuileries, the imperial throne, the Empress beside him, all her\nfaithlessness and pusillanimity forgiven, his son whom he worshipped,\nhis marshals grouped around him; and with a gesture of proud defiance he\nthrew back his head and said loudly:\n\n\"Until to-day I was only an adventurer. To-night I am a prince once\nmore.\"\n\n\nIV\n\nIt was the next morning in that same sparsely-furnished and uncarpeted\nroom of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel des Trois-Dauphins that Napoleon spoke to Victor de\nMarmont, to Emery and Dumoulin about the money which had been stolen\nlast year from the Empress and which he understood had been deposited\nin the cellars of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville.\n\n\"I am not going,\" he said, \"to levy a war tax on my good city of\nGrenoble, but my good and faithful soldiers must be paid, and I must\nprovision my army in case I encounter stronger resistance at Lyons than\nI can cope with, and am forced to make a d\u00c3\u00a9tour. I want the money--the\nEmpress' money, which that infamous Talleyrand stole from her. So you,\nde Marmont, had best go straight away to the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville and in my\nname summon the pr\u00c3\u00a9fet to appear before me. You can tell him at once\nthat it is on account of the money.\"\n\n\"I will go at once, Sire,\" replied de Marmont with a regretful sigh,\n\"but I fear me that it is too late.\"\n\n\"Too late?\" snapped out the Emperor with a frown, \"what do you mean by\ntoo late?\"\n\n\"I mean that Fourier has left Grenoble in the trail of Marchand, and\nthat two days ago--unless I'm very much mistaken--he disposed of the\nmoney.\"\n\n\"Disposed of the money? You are mad, de Marmont.\"\n\n\"Not altogether, Sire. When I say that Fourier disposed of the Empress'\nmoney I only mean that he deposited it in what he would deem a safe\nplace.\"\n\n\"The cur!\" exclaimed Napoleon with a yet tighter clenching of his hand\nand mighty fist, \"turning against the hand that fed him and made him\nwhat he is. Well!\" he added impatiently, \"where is the money now?\"\n\n\"In the keeping of M. le Comte de Cambray at Brestalou,\" replied de\nMarmont without hesitation.\n\n\"Very well,\" said the Emperor, \"take a company of the 7th regiment with\nyou to Brestalou and requisition the money at once.\"\n\n\"If--as I believe--the Comte no longer has the money by him?----\"\n\n\"Make him tell you where it is.\"\n\n\"I mean, Sire, that it is my belief that M. le Comte's sister and\ndaughter will undertake to take the money to Paris, hoping by their sex\nand general air of innocence to escape suspicion in connection with the\nmoney.\"\n\n\"Don't worry me with all these details, de Marmont,\" broke in Napoleon\nwith a frown of impatience. \"I told you to take a company with you and\nto get me the Empress' money. See to it that this is done and leave me\nin peace.\"\n\nHe hated arguing, hated opposition, the very suggestion of any\ndifficulty. His followers and intimates knew that; already de Marmont\nhad repented that he had allowed his tongue to ramble on quite so much.\nNow he felt that silence must redeem his blunder--silence now and\nsuccess in his undertaking.\n\nHe bent the knee, for this homage the great Corsican adventurer and\none-time dictator of civilised Europe loved to receive: he kissed the\nhand which had once wielded the sceptre of a mighty Empire and was ready\nnow to grasp it again. Then he rose and gave the military salute.\n\n\"It shall be done, Sire,\" was all that he said.\n\nHis heart was full of enthusiasm, and the task allotted to him was a\ncongenial one: the baffling and discomfiture of those who had insulted\nhim. If--as he believed--Crystal would be accompanying her aunt on the\njourney toward Paris, then indeed would his own longing for some sort of\nrevenge for the humiliation which he had endured on that memorable\nSunday evening be fully gratified.\n\nIt was with a light and swinging step that he ran down the narrow stairs\nof the hotel. In the little entrance hall below he met Clyffurde.\n\nIn his usual impulsive way, without thought of what had gone before or\nwas likely to happen in the future, he went up to the Englishman with\noutstretched hand.\n\n\"My dear Clyffurde,\" he said with unaffected cordiality, \"I am glad to\nsee you! I have been wondering what had become of you since we parted on\nSunday last. My dear friend,\" he added ecstatically, \"what glorious\nevents, eh?\"\n\nHe did not wait for Clyffurde's reply, nor did he appear to notice the\nlatter's obvious coldness of manner, but went prattling on with great\nvolubility.\n\n\"What a man!\" he exclaimed, nodding significantly in the direction\nwhence he had just come. \"A six days' march--mostly on foot and along\nsteep mountain paths! and to-day as fresh and vigorous as if he had just\nspent a month's holiday at some pleasant watering place! What luck to be\nserving such a man! And what luck to be able to render him really useful\nservice! The tables will be turned, eh, my dear Clyffurde?\" he added,\ngiving his taciturn friend a jovial dig in the ribs, \"and what lovely\ndiscomfiture for our proud aristocrats, eh? They will be sorry to have\nmade an enemy of Victor de Marmont, what?\"\n\nWhereupon Clyffurde made a violent effort to appear friendly and jovial\ntoo.\n\n\"Why,\" he said with a pleasant laugh, \"what madcap ideas are floating\nthrough your head now?\"\n\n\"Madcap schemes?\" ejaculated de Marmont. \"Nothing more or less, my dear\nClyffurde, than complete revenge for the humiliation those de Cambrays\nput upon me last Sunday.\"\n\n\"Revenge? That sounds exciting,\" said Clyffurde with a smile, even while\nhis palm itched to slap the young braggart's face.\n\n\"Exciting, _par Dieu!_ Of course it will be exciting. They have no idea\nthat I guessed their little machinations. Mme. la Duchesse d'Agen\ntravelling to Paris forsooth! Aye! but with five and twenty millions\nsewn somewhere inside her petticoats. Well! the Emperor happens to want\nhis own five and twenty millions, if you please. So Mme. la Duchesse or\nM. le Comte will have to disgorge. And I shall have the pleasing task\nof _making_ them disgorge. What say you to that, friend Clyffurde?\"\n\n\"That I am sorry for you,\" replied the other drily.\n\n\"Sorry for me? Why?\"\n\n\"Because it is never a pleasing task to bully a defenceless woman--and\nan old one at that.\"\n\nDe Marmont laughed aloud. \"Bully Mme. la Duchesse d'Agen?\" he exclaimed.\n\"_Sacr\u00c3\u00a9 tonnerre!_ what do you take me for. I shall not bully her. Fifty\nsoldiers don't bully a defenceless woman. We shall treat Mme. la\nDuchesse with every consideration: we shall only remove five and twenty\nmillions of stolen money from her carriage, that is all.\"\n\n\"You may be mistaken about the money, de Marmont. It may be anywhere\nexcept in the keeping of Mme. la Duchesse.\"\n\n\"It may be at the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau de Brestalou in the keeping of M. le Comte de\nCambray: and this I shall find out first of all. But I must not stand\ngossiping any longer. I must see Colonel de la B\u00c3\u00a9doy\u00c3\u00a8re and get the men\nI want. What are your plans, my dear Clyffurde?\"\n\n\"The same as before,\" replied Bobby quietly. \"I shall leave Grenoble as\nsoon as I can.\"\n\n\"Let the Emperor send you on a special mission to Lord Grenville, in\nLondon, to urge England to remain neutral in the coming struggle.\"\n\n\"I think not,\" said Clyffurde enigmatically.\n\nDe Marmont did not wait to ask him to what this brief remark had\napplied; he bade his friend a hasty farewell, then he turned on his\nheel, and gaily whistling the refrain of the \"Marseillaise,\" stalked out\nof the hotel.\n\nClyffurde remained standing in the narrow panelled hall, which just then\nreeked strongly of stewed onions and of hot coffee; he never moved a\nmuscle, but remained absolutely quiet for the space of exactly two\nminutes; then he consulted his watch--it was then close on midday--and\nfinally went back to his room.\n\n\nV\n\nAn hour after dawn that self-same morning the travelling coach of M. le\nComte de Cambray was at the perron of the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau de Brestalou.\n\nAt the last moment, when M. le Comte, hopelessly discouraged by the\nsurrender of Grenoble to the usurper, came home at a late hour of the\nnight, he decided that he too would journey to Paris with his sister and\ndaughter, taking the money with him to His Majesty, who indeed would\nsoon be in sore need of funds.\n\nAt that same late hour of the night M. le Comte discovered that with the\nexception of faithful Hector and one or two scullions in the kitchen his\nmale servants both indoor and out had wandered in a body out to Grenoble\nto witness \"the Emperor's\" entry into the city. They had marched out of\nthe ch\u00c3\u00a2teau to the cry of \"Vive l'Empereur!\" and outside the gates had\njoined a number of villagers of Brestalou who were bent on the same\nerrand.\n\nFortunately one of the coachmen and two of the older grooms from the\nstables returned in the early dawn after the street demonstrations\noutside the Emperor's windows had somewhat calmed down, and with the\nroutine of many years of domestic service had promptly and without\nmurmurings set to to obey the orders given to them the day before: to\nhave the travelling berline ready with four horses by seven o'clock.\n\nIt was very cold: the coachman and postillions shivered under their\nthreadbare liveries. The coachman had wrapped a woollen comforter round\nhis neck and pulled his white beaver broad-brimmed hat well over his\nbrows, as the northeast wind was keen and would blow into his face all\nthe way to Lyons, where the party would halt for the night. He had\nthick woollen gloves on and of his entire burly person only the tip of\nhis nose could be seen between his muffler and the brim of his hat. The\npostillions, whip in hand, could not wrap themselves up quite so snugly:\nthey were trying to keep themselves warm by beating their arms against\ntheir chest.\n\nM. le Comte, aided by Hector, was arranging for the disposal of leather\nwallets underneath the cushions of the carriage. The wallets contained\nthe money--twenty-five millions in notes and drafts--a godsend to the\nKing if the usurper did succeed in driving him out of the Tuileries.\n\nPresently the ladies came down the perron steps with faithful Jeanne in\nattendance, who carried small bags and dressing-cases. Both the ladies\nwere wrapped in long fur-lined cloaks and Mme. la Duchesse d'Agen had\ndrawn a hood closely round her face; but Crystal de Cambray stood\nbareheaded in the cold frosty air, the hood of her cloak thrown back,\nher own fair hair, dressed high, forming the only covering for her head.\n\nHer face looked grave and even anxious, but wonderfully serene. This\nshould have been her wedding morning, the bells of old Brestalou church\nshould even now have been ringing out their first joyous peal to\nannounce the great event. Often and often in the past few weeks, ever\nsince her father had formally betrothed her to Victor de Marmont, she\nhad thought of this coming morning, and steeled herself to be brave\nagainst the fateful day. She had been resigned to the decree of the\nfather and to the necessities of family and name--resigned but terribly\nheartsore. She was obeying of her own free will but not blindly. She\nknew that her marriage to a man whom she did not love was a sacrifice on\nher part of every hope of future happiness. Her girlish love for St.\nGenis had opened her eyes to the possibilities of happiness; she knew\nthat Life could hold out a veritable cornucopia of delight and joy in a\nunion which was hallowed by Love, and her ready sacrifice was therefore\nall the greater, all the more sublime, because it was not offered up in\nignorance.\n\nBut all that now was changed. She was once more free to indulge in those\ndreams which had gladdened the days and nights of her lonely girlhood\nout in far-off England: dreams which somehow had not even found their\nculmination when St. Genis first told her of his love for her. They had\nalways been golden dreams which had haunted her in those distant days,\ndreams of future happiness and of love which are seldom absent from a\nyoung girl's mind, especially if she is a little lonely, has few\npleasures and is surrounded with an atmosphere of sadness.\n\nCrystal de Cambray, standing on the perron of her stately home, felt but\nlittle sorrow at leaving it to-day: she had hardly had the time in one\nbrief year to get very much attached to it: the sense of unreality which\nhad been born in her when her father led her through its vast halls and\nstately parks had never entirely left her. The little home in England,\nthe tiny sitting-room with its bow window, and small front garden edged\nwith dusty evergreens, was far more real to her even now. She felt as if\nthe last year with its pomp and gloomy magnificence was all a dream and\nthat she was once more on the threshold of reality now, on the point of\nwaking, when she would find herself once more in her narrow iron bed and\nsee the patched and darned muslin curtains gently waving in the draught.\n\nBut for the moment she was glad enough to give herself to the delight of\nthis sudden consciousness of freedom. She sniffed the sharp, frosty air\nwith dilated nostrils like a young Arab filly that scents the\nillimitable vastness of meadowland around her. The excitement of the\ncoming adventure thrilled her: she watched with glowing eyes the\npreparations for the journey, the bestowal under the cushions of the\ncarriage of the money which was to help King Louis to preserve his\nthrone.\n\nIn a sense she was sorry that her father and her aunt were coming too.\nShe would have loved to fly across country as a trusted servant of her\nKing; but when the time came to make a start she took her place in the\nbig travelling coach with a light heart and a merry face. She was so\nsure of the justice of the King's cause, so convinced of God's wrath\nagainst the usurper, that she had no room in her thoughts for\napprehension or sadness.\n\nThe Comte de Cambray on the other hand was grave and taciturn. He had\nspent hours last evening on the ramparts of Grenoble. He had watched the\ndissatisfaction of the troops grow into open rebellion and from that to\nburning enthusiasm for the Corsican ogre. St. Genis had given him a\nvivid account of the encounter at Laffray, and his ears were still\nringing with the cries of \"Vive l'Empereur!\" which had filled the\nstreets and ramparts of Grenoble until he himself fled back to his own\nch\u00c3\u00a2teau, sickened at all that he had seen and heard.\n\nHe knew that the King's own brother, M. le Comte d'Artois, was at Lyons\neven now with forty thousand men who were reputed to be loyal, but were\nnot the troops of Grenoble reputed to be loyal too? and was it likely\nthat the regiments at Lyons would behave so very differently to those at\nGrenoble?\n\nThus the wearisome journey northwards in the lumbering carriage\nproceeded mostly in silence. None of the occupants seemed to have much\nto say. Mme. la Duchesse d'Agen and M. le Comte sat on the back seats\nleaning against the cushions; Crystal de Cambray and ever-faithful\nJeanne sat in front, making themselves as comfortable as they could.\n\nThere was a halt for _d\u00c3\u00a9jeuner_ and change of horses at Rives, and here\nMaurice de St. Genis overtook the party. He proposed to continue the\njourney as far as Lyons on horseback, riding close by the off side of\nthe carriage. Here as well as at the next halt, at St. Andr\u00c3\u00a9-le-Gaz,\nMaurice tried to get speech with Crystal, but she seemed cold in manner\nand unresponsive to his whispered words. He tried to approach her, but\nshe pleaded fatigue and anxiety, and he was glad then that he had made\narrangements not to travel beside her in the lumbering coach. His\nposition on horseback beside the carriage would, he felt, be a more\nromantic one, and he half-hoped that some enterprising footpad would\ngive him a chance of displaying his pluck and his devotion.\n\nA start was made from St. Andr\u00c3\u00a9-le-Gaz at six o'clock in the afternoon.\nCrystal was getting very cramped and tired, even the fine views over the\nrange of the Grande Chartreuse and the long white plateau of the Dent de\nCrolles, with the wintry sunset behind it, failed to enchain her\nattention. Her father and her aunt slept most of the time each in a\ncorner of the carriage, and after the start from St. Andr\u00c3\u00a9-le-Gaz,\ncomforted with hot coffee and fresh bread and the prospect of Lyons now\nonly some sixty kilom\u00c3\u00a8tres away, Crystal settled herself against the\ncushions and tried to get some sleep.\n\nThe incessant shaking of the carriage, the rattle of harness and wheels,\nthe cracking of the postillions' whips, all contributed to making her\nhead ache, and to chase slumber away. But gradually her thoughts became\nmore confused, as the dim winter twilight gradually faded into night and\na veil of impenetrable blackness spread itself outside the windows of\nthe coach.\n\nThe northeasterly wind had not abated: it whistled mournfully through\nthe cracks in the woodwork of the carriage and made the windows rattle\nin their framework. On the box the coachman had much ado to see well\nahead of him, as the vapour which rose from the flanks and shoulders of\nhis steaming horses effectually blurred every outline on the road. The\ncarriage lanthorns threw a weird and feeble light upon the ever-growing\ndarkness. To right and left the bare and frozen common land stretched\nits lonely vastness to some distant horizon unseen.\n\n\nVI\n\nSuddenly the cumbrous vehicle gave a terrific lurch, which sent the\nunsuspecting Jeanne flying into Mme. la Duchesse's lap and threw Crystal\nwith equal violence against her father's knees. There was much cracking\nof whips, loud calls and louder oaths from coachman and postillions,\nmuch creaking and groaning of wheels, another lurch--more feeble this\ntime--more groaning, more creaking, more oaths and finally the coach\nwith a final quivering as it were of all its parts settled down to an\nominous standstill.\n\nWhereafter the oaths sounded more muffled, while there was a scampering\ndown from the high altitude of the coachman's box and a confused murmur\nof voices.\n\nIt was then close on eight o'clock: Lyons was distant still some dozen\nmiles or so--and the night by now was darker than pitch.\n\nM. le Comte, roused from fitful slumbers and trying to gather his\nwandering wits, put his head out of the window: \"What is it, Pierre?\" he\ncalled out loudly. \"What has happened?\"\n\n\"It's this confounded ditch, M. le Comte,\" came in a gruff voice from\nout the darkness. \"I didn't know the bridge had entirely broken down.\nThis sacr\u00c3\u00a9 government will not look after the roads properly.\"\n\n\"Are you there, Maurice?\" called the Comte.\n\nBut strangely enough there came no answer to his call. M. de St. Genis\nmust have fallen back some little distance in the rear, else he surely\nwould have heard something of the clatter, the shouts and the swearing\nwhich were attending the present unfortunate contretemps.\n\n\"Maurice! where are you?\" called the Comte again. And still no answer.\n\nPierre was continuing his audible mutterings. \"Darkness as black\nas----\": then he shouted with a yet more forcible volley of oaths:\n\"Jean! you oaf! get hold of the off mare, can't you? And you, what's\nyour name, you fool? ease the near gelding. Heavens above, what dolts!\"\n\n\"Stop a moment,\" cried M. le Comte, \"wait till the ladies can get out.\nThis pulling and lurching is unbearable.\"\n\n\"Ease a moment,\" commanded Pierre stolidly. \"Go to the near door, Jean,\nand help the master out of the carriage.\"\n\n\"Hark! what was that?\" It was M. le Comte who spoke. There had been a\nmomentary lull in the creaking and groaning of the wheels, while the two\nyoung postillions obeyed the coachman's orders to \"ease a moment,\" and\none of them came round to help the ladies and his master out of the\nlurching vehicle; only the horses' snorting, the champing of their bits\nand pawing of the hard ground broke the silence of the night.\n\nM. le Comte had opened the near door and was half out of the carriage\nwhen a sound caught his ear which was in no way connected with the\nstranded vehicle and its team of snorting horses. Yet the sound came\nfrom horses--horses which were on the move not very far away and which\neven now seemed to be coming nearer.\n\n\"Who goes there? Maurice, is that you?\" called M. le Comte more loudly.\n\n\"Stand and deliver!\" came the peremptory response.\n\n\"Stand yourself or I fire,\" retorted the Comte, who was already groping\nfor the pistol which he kept inside the carriage.\n\n\"You murderous villain!\" came with the inevitable string of oaths from\nPierre the coachman. \"You .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nThe rest of this forceful expletive was broken and muffled. Evidently\nPierre had been summarily gagged. There was a short, sharp scuffle\nsomewhere on ahead; cries for help from the two postillions which were\nequally sharply smothered. The horses began rearing and plunging.\n\n\"One of you at the leaders' heads,\" came in a clear voice which in this\nimpenetrable darkness sounded weirdly familiar to the occupants of the\ncarriage, who awed, terrified by this unforeseen attack sat motionless,\nclinging to one another inside the vehicle.\n\nAlone the Comte had not lost his presence of mind. Already he had jumped\nout of the carriage, banging the door to behind him, despite feeble\nprotests from his sister; pistol in hand he tried with anxious eyes to\npierce the inky blackness around him.\n\nA muffled groan on his right caused him to turn in that direction.\n\n\"Release my coachman,\" he called peremptorily, \"or I fire.\"\n\n\"Easy, M. le Comte,\" came as a sharp warning out of the night, in those\nsame weirdly familiar tones; \"as like as not you would be shooting your\nown men in this infernal darkness.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\" whispered Crystal hoarsely. \"I seem to know that voice.\"\n\n\"God protect us,\" murmured Jeanne. \"It's the devil's voice,\nMademoiselle.\"\n\nMme. la Duchesse said nothing. No doubt she was too frightened to speak.\nHer thin, bony fingers were clasped tightly round her niece's hands.\n\nSuddenly there was another scuffle by the door, the sharp report of a\npistol and then that strangely familiar voice called out again:\n\n\"Merely as a matter of form, M. le Comte!\"\n\n\"You will hang for this, you rogue,\" came in response from the Comte.\n\nBut already Crystal had torn her hands out of Mme. la Duchesse's grasp\nand now was struggling to free herself from Jeanne's terrified and\nclinging embrace.\n\n\"Father!\" she cried wildly. \"Maurice! Maurice! Help! Let me go, Jeanne!\nThey are hurting him!\"\n\nShe had succeeded in pushing Jeanne roughly away and already had her\nhand on the door, when it was opened from the outside, and the\nflickering light of a carriage lanthorn fell full on the interior of the\nvehicle. Neither Crystal nor Mme. la Duchesse could effectually suppress\na sudden gasp of terror, whilst Jeanne threw her shawl right over her\nhead, for of a truth she thought that here was the devil himself.\n\nThe light illumined the lanthorn-bearer only fitfully, but to the\nterror-stricken women he appeared to be preternaturally tall and broad,\nwith wide caped coat pulled up to his ears and an old-fashioned tricorne\nhat on his head; his face was entirely hidden by a black mask, and his\nhands by black kid gloves.\n\n\"I pray you ladies,\" he said quietly, and this time the voice was\nobviously disguised and quite unrecognisable. \"I pray you have no fear.\nNeither I nor my men will do you or yours the slightest harm, if you\nwill allow me without any molestation on your part to make an\nexamination of the interior of your carriage.\"\n\nMme. la Duchesse and Jeanne remained silent: the one from fear, the\nother from dignity. But it was not in Crystal's nature to submit quietly\nto any unlawful coercion.\n\n\"This is an infamy,\" she protested loudly, \"and you, my man, will swing\non the nearest gallows for it.\"\n\n\"No doubt I should if I were found out,\" said the man imperturbably,\n\"but the military patrols of M. le Comte d'Artois don't come out as far\nas this: nevertheless I must ask you ladies not to detain me on my\nbusiness any longer. My men are at the door and it is over a quarter of\nan hour ago since we placed M. de St. Genis temporarily yet effectually\nhors de combat. I pray you, therefore, step out without delay so that I\nmay proceed to ascertain whether there is anything in this carriage\nlikely to suit my requirements.\"\n\n\"You must be a madman as well as a thief,\" retorted Crystal loudly, \"to\nimagine that we would submit to such an outrage.\"\n\n\"If you do not submit, Madame,\" said the man calmly, \"I will order my\nman to shoot M. le Comte in the right leg.\"\n\n\"You would not dare. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nBut the miscreant turned his head slowly round and called over his\nshoulder into the night:\n\n\"Attention, my men! M. le Comte de Cambray!--have you got him?\"\n\n\"Aye! aye, sir!\" came from out the darkness.\n\nCrystal gave a wild scream, and with an agonised gesture of terror\nclutched the highway robber by the coat.\n\n\"No! no!\" she cried. \"Stop! stop! no! Father! Help!\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said the man, quietly releasing his coat from her\nclinging hands, \"remember that M. le Comte is perfectly safe if you will\ndeign to step out of the carriage without further delay.\"\n\nHe held the lanthorn in one hand, the other was suddenly imprisoned by\nCrystal's trembling fingers.\n\n\"Sir,\" she pleaded in a voice broken by terror and anxiety, \"we are\nhelpless travellers on our way to Paris, driven out of our home by the\nadvancing horde of Corsican brigands. Our little all we have with us.\nYou cannot take that all from us. Let us give you some money of our own\nfree will, then the shame of robbing women who have in the darkness of\nthe night been rendered helpless will not rest upon you. Oh! have pity\nupon us. Your voice is so gentle you must be good and kind. You will let\nus proceed on our way, will you not? and we'll take a solemn oath that\nwe'll not attempt to put any one on your track. You will, won't you? I\nswear to you that you will be doing a far finer deed thereby than you\ncan possibly dream of.\"\n\n\"I have some jewelry about my person,\" here interposed Madame's sharp\nvoice drily, \"also some gold. I agree to what my niece says. We'll swear\nto do nothing against you when we reach Lyons, if you will be content\nwith what we give you of our own free will and let us go in peace.\"\n\nThe man allowed both ladies to speak without any interruption on his\npart. He even allowed Crystal's dainty fingers to cling around his\ngloved hand for as long as she chose: no doubt he found some pleasure in\nthis tearful appeal from such beautiful lips, for Crystal looked\ndivinely pretty just then, with the flickering light of the lanthorn\nthrowing her fair head into bold relief against the surrounding gloom.\nHer blue eyes were shining with unshed tears, her delicate mouth was\nquivering with the piteousness of her appeal.\n\nBut when Mme. la Duchesse had finished speaking and began to divest\nherself of her rings he released his hand very gently and said in his\neven, quiet voice:\n\n\"Your pardon, Madame; but as it happens I have no use for ladies'\ntrinkets, while all that you have been good enough to tell me only makes\nme the more eager to examine the contents of this carriage.\"\n\n\"But there's nothing of value in it,\" asserted Madame unblushingly,\n\"except what we are offering you now.\"\n\n\"That is as may be, Madame. I would wish to ascertain.\"\n\n\"You impious malapert!\" she cried out wrathfully, \"would you dare lay\nhands upon a woman?\"\n\n\"No, Madame, certainly not,\" he replied. \"I will merely, as I have had\nthe honour to tell you, order my men to shoot M. le Comte de Cambray in\nthe right leg.\"\n\n\"You vagabond! you thief! you wouldn't dare,\" expostulated Madame, who\nseemed now on the verge of hysteria.\n\n\"Attention, my men!\" he called once more over his left shoulder.\n\n\"It is no use, _ma tante_,\" here interposed Crystal with sudden calm.\n\"We must yield to brute force. Let us get out and allow this abominable\nthief to wreak his impious will with us, else we lay ourselves open to\nfurther outrage at his hands. Be sure that retribution, swift and\ncertain, will overtake him in the end.\"\n\n\"Come! that's wisely spoken,\" said the man, who seemed in no way\nperturbed by the scornful glances which Crystal and Madame now freely\ndarted upon him. He stood a little aside, holding the door open for them\nto step out of the carriage.\n\n\"Where is M. le Comte de Cambray?\" queried Crystal as she brushed past\nhim.\n\n\"Close by,\" he replied, \"to your right now, Mademoiselle, and perfectly\nsafe, and M. le Marquis de St. Genis is not two hundred m\u00c3\u00a8tres away,\nequally secure and equally safe. Here, le Bossu,\" he added, calling out\ninto the night, \"ease the gag round your prisoner's mouth a little so\nthat he may speak to the ladies.\"\n\nWhile Madame la Duchesse groped her way along in the direction whence\ncame sounds of stirring, groaning and not a little cursing which\nproclaimed the presence of some men held captive by others, Crystal\nremained beside the carriage door as if rooted to the spot. The feeble\nlight of the lanthorn had shown her at a glance that the masked\nmiscreant had taken every precaution for the success of his nefarious\npurpose. How many men he had with him altogether, she could not of\ncourse ascertain: half a dozen perhaps, seeing that her father, the\ncoachman and two postillions had been overpowered and were being closely\nguarded, whilst she distinctly saw that two men at least were standing\nbehind their chief at this moment in order to ward off any possible\nattack against him from the rear, while he himself was engaged in the\ninfamous task of robbing the coach of its contents.\n\nCrystal saw him start to work in a most methodical manner. He had stood\nthe lanthorn on the floor of the carriage and was turning over every\ncushion and ransacking every pocket. The leather wallets which he found,\nhe examined with utmost coolness, seeing indeed that they were stuffed\nfull of banknotes and drafts. His huge caped coat appeared to have\nimmense pockets, into which those precious wallets disappeared one by\none.\n\nShe knew of course that resistance was useless: the occasional glint of\nthe feeble lanthorn light upon the pistols held by the men close beside\nher taught her the salutary lesson of silence and dignity. She clenched\nher hands until her nails were almost driven into the flesh of her\npalms, and her face now glowed with a fierce and passionate resentment.\nThis money which might have saved the King and France from the immediate\neffects of the usurper's invasion was now the booty of a common thief!\nWild thoughts of vengeance coursed through her brain: she felt like a\ntiger-cat that was being robbed of its young. Once--unable to control\nherself--she made a wild dash forward, determined to fight for her\ntreasure, to scratch or to bite--to do anything in fact rather than\nstand by and see this infamous spoliation. But immediately her hands\nwere seized, and an ominous word of command rang out weirdly through the\nnight.\n\n\"Resistance here! Attention over there!\"\n\nHer father's safety was a guarantee of her own acquiescence. Struggling,\nfighting was useless! the abominable thief must be left to do his work\nin peace.\n\nIt did not take long. A minute or two later he too had stepped out of\nthe carriage. He ordered one of his followers to hold the lanthorn and\nthen quietly took up his stand beside the open door.\n\n\"Now, ladies, an you desire it,\" he said calmly, \"you may continue your\njourney. Your coachman and your men are close here, on the road,\nsecurely bound. M. de St. Genis is not far off--straight up the\nroad--you cannot miss him. We leave you free to loosen their bonds. To\nhorse, my men!\" he added in a loud, commanding voice. \"Le Bossu, hold my\nhorse a moment! and you ladies, I pray you accept my humble apologies\nthat I do not stop to see you safely installed.\"\n\nAs in a dream Crystal heard the bustle incident on a number of men\ngetting to horse: in the gloom she saw vague forms moving about\nhurriedly, she heard the champing of bits, the clatter of stirrup and\nbridle. The masked man was the last to move. After he had given the\norder to mount he stood for nearly a minute by the carriage door,\nexactly facing Crystal, not five paces away.\n\nHis companion had put the lanthorn down on the step, and by its light\nshe could see him distinctly: a mysterious, masked figure who, with\nwanton infamy, had placed the satisfaction of his dishonesty and of his\ngreed athwart the destiny of the King of France.\n\nCrystal knew that through the peep-holes of his mask, the man's eyes\nwere fixed intently upon her and the knowledge caused a blush of\nmortification and of shame to flood her cheeks and throat. At that\nmoment she would gladly have given her life for the power to turn the\ntables upon that abominable rogue, to filch from him that precious\ntreasure which she had hoped to deposit at the feet of the King for the\nultimate success of his cause: and she would have given much for the\npower to tear off that concealing mask, so that for the rest of her life\nshe might be able to visualise that face which she would always\nexecrate.\n\nSomething of what she felt and thought must have been apparent in her\nexpressive eyes, for presently it seemed to her as if beneath the narrow\ncurtain that concealed the lower part of the man's face there hovered\nthe shadow of a smile.\n\nThe next moment he had the audacity slightly to raise his hat and to\nmake her a bow before he finally turned to go. Crystal had taken one\nstep backward just then, whether because she was afraid that the man\nwould try and approach her, or because of a mere sense of dignity, she\ncould not herself have said. Certain it is that she did move back and\nthat in so doing her foot came in contact with an object lying on the\nground. The shape and size of it were unmistakable, it was the pistol\nwhich the Comte must have dropped when first he stepped out of the\ncarriage, and was seized upon by this band of thieves. Guided by that\nsame strange and wonderful instinct which has so often caused women in\ntimes of war to turn against the assailants of their men or devastation\nof their homes, Crystal picked up the weapon without a moment's\nhesitation; she knew that it was loaded, and she knew how to use it.\nEven as the masked man moved away into the darkness, she fired in the\ndirection whence his firm footsteps still sent their repeated echo.\n\nThe short, sharp report died out in the still, frosty air; Crystal\nvainly strained her ears to catch the sound of a fall or a groan. But in\nthe confusion that ensued she could not distinguish any individual\nsound. She knew that Mme. la Duchesse and Jeanne had screamed, she heard\na few loud curses, the clatter of bits and bridles, the snorting of\nhorses and presently the noise of several horses galloping away, out in\nthe direction of Chamb\u00c3\u00a9ry.\n\nThen nothing more.\n\n\nVII\n\nM. le Comte as well as the coachman and postillions were lying helpless\nand bound somewhere in the darkness. It took the three women some time\nto find them first and then to release them.\n\nCrystal with great presence of mind had run to the horses' heads,\ndirectly after she had fired that random shot. The poor, frightened\nanimals had reared and plunged, and had thereby succeeded in dragging\nthe heavy carriage out of the ditch. After which they had stopped, rigid\nfor a moment and trembling as horses will sometimes when they are\nterrified, before they start running away for dear life. That moment was\nCrystal's opportunity and fortunately she took it at the right time and\nin the right way.\n\nA hand on the leaders' bridles, a soothing voice, the absence of further\nalarming noises tended at once to quieten the team--a set of good steady\nNormandy draft-horses with none too much corn in their bellies to heat\ntheir sluggish blood.\n\nWhile Crystal stood at her post, Mme. la Duchesse--cool and\npractical--found her way firstly to M. le Comte, then to the coachman\nand postillions, and ordering Jeanne to help her, she succeeded in\nfreeing the men from their bonds.\n\nThen calling to one of them to precede her with a lanthorn, she started\non the quest for Maurice de St. Genis. He was found--as that abominable\nthief had said--some two hundred yards up the road, very securely bound\nand with his own handkerchief tied round his mouth, but otherwise\ncomfortably laid on a dry bit of roadside grass.\n\nMme. la Duchesse would not reply to his questions, but after he was\nreleased and able to stand up she made him give her a brief account of\nhis adventure. It had all been so sudden and so quick--he had fallen\nback a little behind the carriage as soon as the night had set in, as he\nthought it safer to keep along the edge of the road. He was feeling\ntired and drowsy, and allowing his horse to amble along in the slow\njog-trot peculiar to its race. No doubt his attention had for some time\nbeen on the wander, when, all at once, in the darkness someone seized\nhold of his horse by the bridle and forced it back upon its haunches.\nThe next moment Maurice felt himself grabbed by the leg, and dragged off\nhis horse: he shouted for help, but the carriage was on ahead and its\nown rattle prevented the shouts from being heard. After which he was\nbound and gagged and summarily left to lie by the roadside. He had had\nno chance against the ruffians, as they were numerous, but they did not\nattempt to ill-use him in any way.\n\nSlowly hobbling towards the carriage beside Mme. la Duchesse, for he was\ncramped and stiff, Maurice told her all there was to tell. He had heard\nthe distant scuffle, the shouts and calls, also one pistol-shot at the\nend, but he had been rendered helpless even before the carriage had come\nto a halt in the ditch.\n\nIt was M. le Comte who in his accustomed measured tones now gave Maurice\nde St. Genis the details of this awful adventure: the ransacking of the\ncarriage by the mysterious miscreant--the loss of the twenty-five\nmillions, the complete shattering of all hope to help the King with this\nmoney in the hour of his need, and finally Crystal's desperate act of\nrevenge, as she shot the pistol off into the darkness, hoping at least\nto disable the impudent rogue who had done them and the King such a\nfatal injury.\n\nSt. Genis listened to it all with lips held tightly pressed together,\nfirm determination causing every muscle in his body to grow taut and\nfirm with the earnestness of his resolve.\n\nWhen M. le Comte had finished speaking, and with a sigh of\ndiscouragement had suggested an immediate continuation of his journey,\nMaurice said resolutely:\n\n\"Do you go on straightway to Lyons with the ladies, my dear Comte, but I\nshall not leave this neighbourhood till by some means or other I find\nthose miscreants and lay their infamous leader by the heel.\"\n\n\"Well spoken, Maurice,\" said the Comte guardedly, \"but how will you do\nit?--it is late and the night darker than ever.\"\n\n\"You must spare me one of your horses, my dear Comte,\" replied the young\nman, \"as mine apparently has been stolen by those abominable thieves,\nand I'll ride back to the nearest village--you remember we passed it not\nhalf an hour ago. I'll get lodgings there and get some information. In\nthe meanwhile perhaps you will see M. le Comte d'Artois immediately,\ntell him all that has happened and beg him to send me as early in the\nmorning as possible a dozen cavalrymen or so, to help me scour the\ncountry. I'll be on the look-out for them on this road by six o'clock,\nand, please God! the day shall not go by before we have those infamous\nmarauders by the heels. Twenty-five millions, remember, are not dragged\nabout open country quite so easily as those thieves imagine. They are\nbound to leave some trace of their whereabouts sometimes.\"\n\nHe appeared so confident and so cheerful that some of his optimism\ninfected M. le Comte too. The latter promised to get an audience of M.\nle Comte d'Artois that very evening, and of course the necessary cavalry\npatrol would at once be forthcoming.\n\n\"God grant you success, Maurice,\" he added fervently, and the young\nman's energy and enthusiasm were also rewarded by a warm, glowing look\nfrom Crystal.\n\nA quarter of an hour afterwards, M. le Comte's travelling coach was once\nmore ready for departure. Pierre had been given his orders to make due\nhaste for Lyons, and to drive a unicorn team of three horses instead of\na regulation four, whereupon he had muttered a string of oaths which\nwould have caused a Paris wine-shop loafer to blush.\n\nOne of the horses thereupon was detached from the team for Maurice's use\nand made ready with one of the postillions' saddles; the other\npostillion had to climb up to the seat next to the coachman: all three\nmen were feeling not a little shamed at the sorry r\u00c3\u00b4le which they had\njust played, and they vowed revenge against the mysterious thieves who\nhad sprung upon them unawares and in the dark, or Mordieu! they would\nhave suffered severely for their impudence.\n\nIn silence M. le Comte, Mme. la Duchesse and Crystal, followed by\nfaithful Jeanne, re-entered the carriage. No one had been hurt. M. le\nComte's arms felt a little stiff from the cords which had bound them\nbehind his back and Jeanne was inclined to be hysterical, but Crystal\nfelt a fierce resentment burning in her heart. Somehow she had no hope\nthat Maurice would succeed, even though she threw him at the last a\nkindly and encouraging smile. Her one hope was that she had inflicted a\npainful if not a deadly wound upon the shameless robber of the King's\nmoney.\n\nSoon the party was once more comfortably settled and the cumbrous\nvehicle, after another violent lurch, was once more on its way.\n\n\"Farewell, Maurice! good luck!\" called M. le Comte at the last.\n\nThe young man waited until the heavy carriage swung more easily upon its\nsprings, then he mounted his horse, turned its head in the opposite\ndirection and rode slowly back up the road.\n\nInside the vehicle all was silent for a while, then M. le Comte asked\nquietly:\n\n\"Did he find everything?\"\n\n\"Everything,\" replied Crystal.\n\n\"I put in five wallets.\"\n\n\"Yes. He took them all.\"\n\n\"It is curious they should have fallen on us just by that broken\nbridge.\"\n\n\"They were lying in wait for us, of course.\"\n\n\"Knowing that we had the money, do you think?\" asked the Comte.\n\n\"Of course,\" replied Crystal with still that note of bitter resentment\nin her voice.\n\n\"But who, besides ourselves and the pr\u00c3\u00a9fet? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" began the Comte, who\nclearly was very puzzled.\n\n\"Victor de Marmont for one .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" retorted the girl.\n\n\"Surely you don't suppose that he would play the r\u00c3\u00b4le of a highwayman\nand .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"No, I don't,\" she broke in somewhat impatiently, \"he wouldn't have the\npluck for one thing, and moreover the masked man was considerably taller\nthan Victor.\"\n\n\"Well, then?\"\n\n\"It is only an idea, father, dear,\" she said more gently, \"but somehow I\ncannot believe that this was just ordinary highway robbery. This road is\nsupposed to be quite safe: travellers are not warned against armed\nhighwaymen, and marauders wouldn't be so well horsed and clothed. My\nbelief is that it was a paid gang stationed at the broken bridge on\npurpose to rob us and no one else.\"\n\n\"Maurice will soon be after them to-morrow, and I'll see M. le Comte\nd'Artois directly we get to Lyons,\" said the Comte after a slight pause,\nduring which he was obviously pondering over his daughter's suggestion.\n\n\"It won't be any use, father,\" Crystal said with a sigh. \"The whole\nthing has been organised, I feel sure, and the head that planned this\nabominable robbery will know how to place his booty in safety.\"\n\nWhereupon the Comte sighed, for he was too well-bred to curse in the\npresence of his daughter and his sister, Mme. la Duchesse had said\nnothing all this while: nor did she offer any comment upon the\nmysterious occurrence all the time that the next stage of the wearisome\njourney proceeded.\n\n\nVIII\n\nLess than an hour later the coach came to a halt once more.\n\nM. le Comte woke up with a start.\n\n\"My God!\" he exclaimed, \"what is it now?\"\n\nCrystal had not been asleep: her thoughts were too busy, her brain too\nmuch tormented with trying to find some plausible answer to the riddle\nwhich agitated her: \"Who had planned this abominable robbery? Was it\nindeed Victor de Marmont himself? or had a greater, a mightier mind than\nhis discovered the secret of this swift journey to Paris and ordered the\nclever raid upon the treasure?\"\n\nThe rumble of the wheels had--though she was awake--prevented her from\nhearing the rapid approach of a number of horses in the wake of the\ncoach, until a peremptory: \"Halt! in the name of the Emperor!\" suddenly\nchased every other thought away; like her father she murmured: \"My God!\nwhat is it now?\"\n\nThis time there was no mystery, there would be no puzzlement as to the\nmeaning of this fresh attack. The air was full of those sounds that\ndenote the presence of many horses and of many men; there was, too, the\nclinking of metal, the champing of steel bits, the brief words of\ncommand which proclaimed the men to be soldiers.\n\nThey appeared to be all round the coach, for the noise of their presence\ncame from everywhere at once.\n\nAlready the Comte had put his head out of the window: \"What is it now?\"\nhe asked again, more peremptorily this time.\n\n\"In the name of the Emperor!\" was the loud reply.\n\n\"We do not halt in the name of an usurper,\" said the Comte. \"En avant,\nPierre!\"\n\n\"You urge those horses on at your peril, coachman,\" was the defiant\nretort.\n\nA quick word of command was given, there was more clanking of metal,\nsnorting of horses, loud curses from Pierre on the box, and the\ncommanding voice spoke again:\n\n\"M. le Comte de Cambray!\"\n\n\"That is my name!\" replied the Comte. \"And who is it, pray, who dares\nimpede peaceful travellers on their way?\"\n\n\"By order of the Emperor,\" was the curt reply.\n\n\"I know of no such person in France!\"\n\n\"Vive l'Empereur!\" was shouted defiantly in response.\n\nWhereupon M. le Comte de Cambray--proud, disdainful and determined to\nshow no fear or concern, withdrew from the window and threw himself back\nagainst the cushions of the carriage.\n\n\"What in the Virgin's name is the meaning of this?\" murmured Mme. la\nDuchesse.\n\n\"God in heaven only knows,\" sighed the Comte.\n\nBut obviously the coach had not been stopped by a troop of mounted\nsoldiers for the mere purpose of proclaiming the Emperor's name on the\nhigh road in the dark. The same commanding voice which had answered the\nComte's challenge was giving rapid orders to dismount and to bring along\none of the carriage lanthorns.\n\nThe next moment the door of the coach was opened from without, and the\nlight of the lanthorn held up by a man in uniform fell full on the\nfigure and on the profile of Victor de Marmont.\n\n\"M. le Comte, I regret,\" he said coldly, \"in the name of the Emperor I\nmust demand from you the restitution of his property.\"\n\nThe Comte shrugged his shoulders and vouchsafed no reply.\n\n\"M. le Comte,\" said de Marmont, more peremptorily this time, \"I have\ntwenty-four men with me, who will seize by force if necessary that which\nI herewith command you to give up voluntarily.\"\n\nStill no reply. M. le Comte de Cambray would think himself bemeaned were\nhe to parley with a traitor.\n\n\"As you will, M. le Comte,\" was de Marmont's calm comment on the old\nman's attitude. \"Sergeant!\" he commanded, \"seize the four persons in\nthis coach. Three of them are women, so be as gentle as you can. Go\nround to the other door first.\"\n\n\"Father,\" now urged Crystal gently, \"do you think that this is wise--or\ndignified?\"\n\n\"Wisely spoken, Mlle. Crystal,\" rejoined de Marmont. \"Have I not said\nthat I have two dozen soldiers with me--all trained to do their duty?\nWhy should M. le Comte allow them to lay hands upon you and on Mme. la\nDuchesse?\"\n\n\"It is an outrage,\" broke in the Comte savagely. \"You and your soldiers\nare traitors, rebels and deserters.\"\n\n\"But we are in superior numbers, M. le Comte,\" said de Marmont with a\nsneer. \"Would it not be wiser to yield with a good grace? Mme. la\nDuchesse,\" he added with an attempt at geniality, \"yours was always the\nwise head, I am told, that guided the affairs of M. le Comte de Cambray\nin the past. Will you not advise him now?\"\n\n\"I would, my good man,\" retorted the Duchesse, \"but my wise counsels\nwould benefit no one now, seeing that you have been sent on a fool's\nerrand.\"\n\nDe Marmont laughed.\n\n\"Does Mme. la Duchesse mean to deny that twenty-five million francs\nbelonging to the Emperor are hidden at this moment inside this coach?\"\n\n\"I deny, Monsieur de Marmont, that any twenty-five million francs belong\nto the son of an impecunious Corsican attorney--and I also deny that any\ntwenty-five million francs are in this coach at the present moment.\"\n\n\"That is exactly what I desire to ascertain, Madame.\"\n\n\"Ascertain by all means then,\" quoth Madame impatiently, \"the other\nthief ascertained the same thing an hour ago, and I must confess that he\ndid so more profitably than you are like to do.\"\n\n\"The other thief?\" exclaimed de Marmont, greatly puzzled.\n\n\"It is as Mme. la Duchesse has deigned to tell you,\" here interposed the\nComte coolly. \"I have no objection to your knowing that I had intended\nto convey to His Majesty the King--its rightful owner--a sum of\nmoney--originally stolen by the Corsican usurper from France--but that\nan hour ago a party of armed thieves--just like yourself--attacked us,\nbound and gagged me and my men, ransacked my coach and made off with the\nbooty.\"\n\n\"And I thank God now,\" murmured Crystal involuntarily, \"that the money\nhas fallen into the hands of a common highwayman rather than in those of\nthe scourge of mankind.\"\n\n\"M. le Comte .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" stammered de Marmont, who, still incredulous, yet\nvaguely alarmed, was nevertheless determined not to accept this\nextraordinary narrative with blind confidence.\n\nBut M. le Comte de Cambray's dignity rose at last to the occasion: \"You\nchoose to disbelieve me, Monsieur?\" he asked quietly.\n\nDe Marmont made no reply.\n\n\"Will my word of honour not suffice?\"\n\n\"My orders, M. le Comte,\" said de Marmont gruffly, \"are that I bring\nback to my Emperor the money that is his. I will not leave one stone\nunturned .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Enough, Monsieur,\" broke in the Comte with calm dignity. \"We will\nalight now, if your soldiers will stand aside.\"\n\nAnd for the second time on this eventful night, Mme. la Duchesse d'Agen\nand Mlle. Crystal de Cambray, together with faithful Jeanne, were forced\nto alight from the coach and to stand by while the cushions of the\ncarriage were being turned over by the light of a flickering lanthorn\nand every corner of the interior ransacked for the elusive treasure.\n\n\"There is nothing here, mon Colonel,\" said a gruff voice out of the\ndarkness, after a while.\n\nA loud curse broke from de Marmont's lips.\n\n\"You are satisfied?\" asked the Comte coldly, \"that I have told you the\ntruth?\"\n\n\"Search the luggage in the boot,\" cried de Marmont savagely, without\nheeding him, \"search the men on the box! bring more light here! That\nmoney is somewhere in this coach, I'll swear. If I do not find it I'll\ntake every one here back a prisoner to Grenoble .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. or .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHe paused, himself ashamed of what he had been about to say.\n\n\"Or you will order your soldiers to lay hands upon our persons, is that\nit, M. de Marmont?\" broke in Crystal coldly.\n\nHe made no reply, for of a truth that had been his thought: foiled in\nhis hope of rendering his beloved Emperor so signal a service, he had\nlost all sense of chivalry in this overwhelming feeling of baffled rage.\n\nCrystal's cold challenge recalled him to himself, and now he felt\nashamed of what he had just contemplated, ashamed, too, of what he had\ndone. He hated the Comte .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. he hated all royalists and all enemies of\nthe Emperor .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but he hated the Comte doubly because of the insults\nwhich he (de Marmont) had had to endure that evening at Brestalou. He\nhad looked upon this expedition as a means of vengeance for those\ninsults, a means, too, of showing his power and his worth before Crystal\nand of winning her through that power which the Emperor had given him,\nand through that worth which the Emperor had recognised.\n\nBut, though he hated the Comte he knew him to be absolutely incapable of\ntelling a deliberate lie, and absolutely incapable of bartering his word\nof honour for the sake of his own safety.\n\nCrystal's words brought this knowledge back to his mind; and now the\ndesire seized him to prove himself as chivalrous as he was powerful. He\nwas one of those men who are so absolutely ignorant of a woman's nature\nthat they believe that a woman's love can be won by deeds as apart from\npersonality, and that a woman's dislike and contempt can be changed into\nlove. He loved Crystal more absolutely now than he had ever done in the\ndays when he was practically her accepted suitor: his unbridled and\ncapricious nature clung desperately to that which he could not hold, and\nsince he had felt--that evening at Brestalou--that his political\nconvictions had placed an insuperable barrier between himself and\nCrystal de Cambray, he felt that no woman on earth could ever be quite\nso desirable.\n\nHis mistake lay in this: that he believed that it was his political\nconvictions alone which had turned Crystal away from him: he felt that\nhe could have won her love through her submission once she was his wife,\nnow he found that he would have to win her love first and her wifely\nsubmission would only follow afterwards.\n\nJust now--though in the gloom he could only see the vague outline of her\ngraceful form, and only heard her voice as through a veil of\ndarkness--he had the longing to prove himself at once worthy of her\nregard and deserving of her gratitude.\n\nWithout replying to her direct challenge, he made a vigorous effort to\ncurb his rage, and to master his disappointment. Then he gave a few\nbrief commands to his sergeant, ordering him to repair the disorder\ninside the coach, and to stop all further searching both of the vehicle\nand of the men.\n\nFinally he said with calm dignity: \"M. le Comte, I must offer you my\nhumble apologies for the inconvenience to which you have been subjected.\nI humbly beg Mme. la Duchesse and Mademoiselle Crystal to accept these\nexpressions of my profound regret. A soldier's life and a soldier's duty\nmust be my excuse for the part I was forced to take in this untoward\nhappening. Mme. la Duchesse, I pray you deign to re-enter your carriage.\nM. le Comte, if there is aught I can do for you, I pray you command me.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nNeither the Duchesse nor the Comte, however, deigned to take the\nslightest notice of the abominable traitor and of his long tirade.\nMadame was shivering with cold and yawning with fatigue, and in her\nheart consigned the young brute to everlasting torments.\n\nThe Comte would have thought it beneath his dignity to accept any\nexplanation from a follower of the Corsican usurper. Without a word he\nwas now helping his sister into the carriage.\n\nJeanne, of course, hardly counted--she was dazed into semi-imbecility by\nthe renewed terrors she had just gone through: so for the moment Victor\nfelt that Crystal was isolated from the others. She stood a little to\none side--he could only just see her, as the sergeant was holding up the\nlanthorn for Mme. la Duchesse to see her way into the coach. M. le Comte\nwent on to give a few directions to the coachman.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Crystal!\" murmured Victor softly.\n\nAnd he made a step forward so that now she could not move toward the\ncarriage without brushing against him. But she made no reply.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Crystal,\" he said again, \"have you not one single kind\nword for me?\"\n\n\"A kind word?\" she retorted almost involuntarily, \"after such an\noutrage?\"\n\n\"I am a soldier,\" he urged, \"and had to do my duty.\"\n\n\"You were a soldier once, M. de Marmont--a soldier of the King. Now you\nare only a deserter.\"\n\n\"A soldier of the Emperor, Mademoiselle, of the man who led France to\nvictory and to glory, and will do so again, now that he has come back\ninto his own once more.\"\n\n\"You and I, M. de Marmont,\" she said coldly, \"look at France from\ndifferent points of view. This is neither the hour nor the place to\ndiscuss our respective sentiments. I pray you, allow me to join my aunt\nin the carriage. I am cold and tired, and she will be anxious for me.\"\n\n\"Will you at least give me one word of encouragement, Mademoiselle?\" he\nurged. \"As you say, our points of view are very different. But I am on\nthe high road to fortune. The Emperor is back in France, the army flocks\nto his eagles as one man. He trusts me and I shall rise to greatness\nunder his wing. Mademoiselle Crystal, you promised me your hand, I have\nnot released you from that promise yet. I will come and claim it soon.\"\n\n\"Excitement seems to have turned your brain, M. de Marmont,\" was all\nthat Crystal said, and she walked straight past him to the carriage\ndoor.\n\nVictor smothered a curse. These aristos were as arrogant as ever. What\nlesson had the revolution and the guillotine taught them? None. This\ngirl who had spent her whole life in poverty and exile, and was\nlike--after a brief interregnum--to return to exile and poverty again,\nwas not a whit less proud than her kindred had been when they walked in\ntheir hundreds up the steps of the guillotine with a smile of lofty\ndisdain upon their lips.\n\nVictor de Marmont was a son of the people--of those who had made the\nrevolution and had fought the whole of Europe in order to establish\ntheir right to govern themselves as they thought best, and he hated all\nthese aristos--the men who had fled from their country and abandoned it\nwhen she needed her sons' help more than she had ever done before.\n\nThe aristocrat was for him synonymous with the \u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9--with the man who\nhad raised a foreign army to fight against France, who had brought the\nforeigner marching triumphantly into Paris. He hated the aristocrat, but\nhe loved Crystal, the one desirable product of that old regime system\nwhich he abhorred.\n\nBut with him a woman's love meant a woman's submission. He was more\ndetermined than ever now to win her, but he wanted to win her through\nher humiliation and his triumph--excitement had turned his brain? Well!\nso be it, fear and oppression would turn her heart and crush her pride.\n\nHe made no further attempt to detain her: he had asked for a kind word\nand she had given him withering scorn. Excitement had turned his brain\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. he was not even worthy of parley--not even worthy of a formal\nrefusal!\n\nTo his credit be it said that the thought of immediate revenge did not\nenter his mind then. He might have subjected her then and there to\ndeadly outrage--he might have had her personal effects searched, her\nperson touched by the rough hands of his soldiers. But though his\nestimate of a woman's love was a low one, it was not so base as to\nimagine that Crystal de Cambray would ever forgive so dastardly an\ninsult.\n\nAs she walked past him to the door, however, he said under his breath:\n\n\"Remember, Mademoiselle, that you and your family at this moment are\nabsolutely in my power, and that it is only because of my regard for you\nthat I let you all now depart from here in peace.\"\n\nWhether she heard or not, he could not say; certain it is that she made\nno reply, nor did she turn toward him at all. The light of the lanthorn\nlit up her delicate profile, pale and drawn, her tightly pressed lips,\nthe look of utter contempt in her eyes, which even the fitful shadow\ncast by her hair over her brows could not altogether conceal.\n\nThe Comte had given what instructions he wished to Pierre. He stood by\nthe carriage door waiting for his daughter: no doubt he had heard what\nwent on between her and de Marmont, and was content to leave her to deal\nwhat scorn was necessary for the humiliation of the traitor.\n\nHe helped Crystal into the carriage, and also the unfortunate Jeanne;\nfinally he too followed, and pulled the door to behind him.\n\nVictor did not wait to see the coach make a start. He gave the order to\nremount.\n\n\"How far are we from St. Priest?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not eight kilom\u00c3\u00a8tres, mon Colonel,\" was the reply.\n\n\"En avant then, ventre-\u00c3\u00a0-terre!\" he commanded, as he swung himself into\nthe saddle.\n\nThe great high road between Grenoble and Lyons is very wide, and Pierre\nhad no need to draw his horses to one side, as de Marmont and his troop,\nafter much scrambling, champing of bits and clanking of metal, rode at a\nsharp trot past the coach and him.\n\nFor some few moments the sound of the horses' hoofs on the hard road\nkept the echoes of the night busy with their resonance, but soon that\nsound grew fainter and fainter still--after five minutes it died away\naltogether.\n\nM. de Comte put his head out of the window.\n\n\"Eh bien, Pierre,\" he called, \"why don't we start?\"\n\nThe postillion cracked his whip; Pierre shouted to his horses; the heavy\ncoach groaned and creaked and was once more on its way.\n\nIn the interior no one spoke. Jeanne's terror had melted in a silent\nflow of tears.\n\n\nLyons was reached shortly before midnight. M. le Comte's carriage had\nsome difficulty in entering the town, as by orders of M. le Comte\nd'Artois it had already been placed in a state of defence against the\npossible advance of the \"band of pirates from Corsica.\" The bridge of La\nGuilloti\u00c3\u00a8re had been strongly barricaded and it took M. le Comte de\nCambray some little time to establish his identity before the officer in\ncommand of the post allowed him to proceed on his way.\n\nThe town was fairly full owing to the presence of M. le Comte d'Artois,\nwho had taken up his quarters at the archiepiscopal palace, and of his\nstaff, who were scattered in various houses about the town. Nevertheless\nM. le Comte and his family were fortunate enough in obtaining\ncomfortable accommodation at the Hotel Bourbon.\n\nThe party was very tired, and after a light supper retired to bed.\n\nBut not before M. le Comte de Cambray had sent a special autographed\nmessage to Monseigneur le Comte d'Artois explaining to him under what\ntragic circumstances the sum of twenty-five million francs destined to\nreach His Majesty the King had fallen into a common highwayman's hands\nand begging that a posse of cavalry be sent out on the road after the\nmarauders and be placed under the orders of M. le Marquis de St. Genis,\nwho would be on the look-out for their arrival. He begged that the posse\nshould consist of not less than thirty men, seeing that some armed\nfollowers of the Corsican brigand were also somewhere on the way.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE RIVALS\n\n\nI\n\nThe weather did not improve as the night wore on: soon a thin, cold\ndrizzle added to the dreariness and to Maurice de St. Genis'\never-growing discomfort.\n\nHe had started off gaily enough, cheered by Crystal's warm look of\nencouragement and comforted by the feeling of certainty that he would\nget even with that mysterious enemy who had so impudently thrown himself\nathwart a plan which had service of the King for its sole object.\n\nMaurice had not exchanged confidences with Crystal since the adventure,\nbut his ideas--without his knowing it--absolutely coincided with hers.\nHe, too, was quite sure that no common footpad had engineered their\ndaring attack. Positive knowledge of the money and its destination had\nbeen the fountain from which had sprung the comedy of the masked\nhighwayman and his little band of robbers. Maurice mentally reckoned\nthat there must have been at least half a dozen of these bravos--of the\nsort that in these times were easily enough hired in any big city to\nplay any part, from that of armed escort to nervous travellers to that\nof seeker of secret information for the benefit of either political\nparty--loafers that hung round the wine-shops in search of a means of\nearning a few days' rations, discharged soldiers of the Empire some of\nthem, whose loyalty to the Restoration had been questioned from the\nfirst.\n\nMaurice had no doubt that whatever motive had actuated the originator of\nthe bold plan to possess himself of twenty-five million francs, he had\ndeliberately set to work to employ men of that type to help him in his\ntask.\n\nIt had all been very audacious and--Maurice was bound to admit--very\nwell carried out. As for the motive, he was never for a moment in doubt.\nIt was a Bonapartist plot, of that he felt sure, as well as of the fact\nthat Victor de Marmont was the originator of it all. He probably had not\ntaken any active part in the attack, but he had employed the\nmen--Maurice would have taken an oath on that!\n\nThe Comte de Cambray must have let fall an unguarded hint in the course\nof his last interview with de Marmont at Brestalou, and when Victor went\naway disgraced and discomfited he, no doubt, thought to take his revenge\nin the way most calculated to injure both the Comte and the royalist\ncause.\n\nSatisfied with this mental explanation of past events, St. Genis had\nridden on in the darkness, his spirits kept up with hopes and thoughts\nof a glaring counter revenge. But his limbs were still stiff and bruised\nfrom the cramped position in which he had lain for so long, and\npresently, when the cold drizzle began to penetrate to his bones, his\nenthusiasm and confidence dwindled. The village seemed to recede further\nand further into the distance. He thought when he had ridden through it\nearlier in the evening that it was not very far from the scene of the\nattack--a dozen kilom\u00c3\u00a8tres perhaps--now it seemed more like thirty; he\nthought too that it was a village of some considerable size--five\nhundred souls or perhaps more--he had noticed as he rode through it a\nwell-illuminated, one-storied house, and the words \"D\u00c3\u00a9bit de vins\" and\n\"Chambres pour voyageurs\" painted in bold characters above the front\ndoor. But now he had ridden on and on along the dark road for what\nseemed endless hours--unconscious of time save that it was dragging on\nleaden-footed and wearisome .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and still no light on ahead to betray\nthe presence of human habitations, no distant church bells to mark the\nprogress of the night.\n\nAt last, in desperation, Maurice de St. Genis had thought of wrapping\nhimself in his cloak and getting what rest he could by the roadside, for\nhe was getting very tired and saddle-sore, when on his left he perceived\nin the far distance, glimmering through the mist, two small lights like\nbright eyes shining in the darkness.\n\nWhat kind of a way led up to those welcome lights, Maurice had, of\ncourse, no idea; but they proclaimed at any rate the presence of human\nbeings, of a house, of the warmth of fire; and without hesitation the\nyoung man turned his horse's head at right angles from the road.\n\nHe had crossed a couple of ploughed fields and an intervening ditch,\nwhen in the distance to his right and behind him he heard the sound of\nhorses at a brisk trot, going in the direction of Lyons.\n\nMaurice drew rein for a moment and listened until the sound came nearer.\nThere must have been at least a score of mounted men--a military patrol\nsent out by M. le Comte d'Artois, no doubt, and now on its way back to\nLyons. Just for a second or two the young man had thoughts of joining up\nwith the party and asking their help or their escort: he even gave a\nvigorous shout which, however, was lost in the clang and clatter of\nhorses' hoofs and of the accompanying jingle of metal.\n\nHe turned his horse back the way he had come; but before he had\nrecrossed one of the ploughed fields, the troop of mounted men--whatever\nthey were--had passed by, and Maurice was left once more in solitude,\nshouting and calling in vain.\n\nThere was nothing for it then, but to turn back again, and to make his\nway as best he could toward those inviting lights. In any case nothing\ncould have been done in this pitch-dark night against the highway\nthieves, and St. Genis had no fear that M. le Comte d'Artois would fail\nto send him help for his expedition against them on the morrow.\n\nThe lights on ahead were getting perceptibly nearer, soon they detached\nthemselves still more clearly in the gloom--other lights appeared in the\nimmediate neighbourhood--too few for a village--thought Maurice, and\ngrouped closely together, suggesting a main building surrounded by other\nsmaller ones close by.\n\nSoon the whole outline of the house could be traced through the\nenveloping darkness: two of the windows were lighted from within, and an\noil lamp, flickering feebly, was fixed in a recess just above the door.\nThe welcome words: \"Chambres pour voyageurs. Aristide Briot,\npropri\u00c3\u00a9taire,\" greeted Maurice's wearied eyes as he drew rein. Good luck\nwas apparently attending him for, thus picking his way across fields, he\nhad evidently struck an out-of-the-way hostelry on some bridle path off\nthe main road, which was probably a short cut between Chamb\u00c3\u00a9ry and\nVienne.\n\nBe that as it may, he managed to dismount--stiff as he was--and having\ntried the door and found it fastened, he hammered against it with his\nboot.\n\nA few moments later, the bolts were drawn and an elderly man in blue\nblouse and wide trousers, his sabots stuffed with straw, came shuffling\nout of the door.\n\n\"Who's there?\" he called in a feeble, querulous voice.\n\n\"A traveller--on horseback,\" replied Maurice. \"Come, petit p\u00c3\u00a8re,\" he\nadded more impatiently, \"will you take my horse or call to one of your\nmen?\"\n\n\"It is too late to take in travellers,\" muttered the old man. \"It is\nnearly midnight, and everyone is abed except me.\"\n\n\"Too late, morbleu?\" exclaimed the young man peremptorily. \"You surely\nare not thinking of refusing shelter to a traveller on a night like\nthis. Why, how far is it to the nearest village?\"\n\n\"It is very late,\" reiterated the old man plaintively, \"and my house is\nquite full.\"\n\n\"There's a shake-down in the kitchen anyway, I'll warrant, and one for\nmy horse somewhere in an outhouse,\" retorted Maurice as without more ado\nhe suddenly threw the reins into the old man's hand and unceremoniously\npushed him into the house.\n\nThe man appeared to hesitate for a moment or two. He grumbled and\nmuttered something which Maurice did not hear, and his shrewd eyes--the\nknowing eyes of a peasant of the Dauphin\u00c3\u00a9--took a rapid survey of the\nbelated traveller's clothes, the expensive caped coat, the well-made\nboots, the fashionable hat, which showed up clearly now by the light\nfrom within.\n\nSatisfied that there could be no risk in taking in so well-dressed a\ntraveller, feeling moreover that a good horse was always a hostage for\nthe payment of the bill in the morning, the man now, without another\nword or look at his guest, turned his back on the house and led the\nhorse away--somewhere out into the darkness--Maurice did not take the\ntrouble to ascertain where.\n\nHe was under shelter. There was the remnant of a wood-fire in the hearth\nat the corner, some benches along the walls. If he could not get a bed,\nhe could certainly get rest and warmth for the night. He put down his\nhat, took off his coat, and kicked the smouldering log into a blaze;\nthen he drew a chair close to the fire and held his numbed feet and\nhands to the pleasing warmth.\n\nThoughts of food and wine presented themselves too, now that he felt a\nlittle less cold and stiff, and he awaited the old man's return with\neagerness and impatience.\n\nThe shuffling of wooden sabots outside the door was a pleasing sound: a\nmoment or two later the old man had come back and was busying himself\nwith once more bolting his front door.\n\n\"Well now, p\u00c3\u00a8re Briot,\" said Maurice cheerily, \"as I take it you are the\nproprietor of this abode of bliss, what about supper?\"\n\n\"Bread and cheese if you like,\" muttered the man curtly.\n\n\"And a bottle of wine, of course.\"\n\n\"Yes. A bottle of wine.\"\n\n\"Well! be quick about it, petit p\u00c3\u00a8re. I didn't know how hungry I was\ntill you talked of bread and cheese.\"\n\n\"Would you like some cold meat?\" queried the man indifferently.\n\n\"Of course I should! Have I not said that I was hungry?\"\n\n\"You'll pay for it all right enough?\"\n\n\"I'll pay for the supper before I stick a fork into it,\" rejoined\nMaurice impatiently, \"but in Heaven's name hurry up, man! I am half dead\nwith sleep as well as with hunger.\"\n\nThe old man--a real peasant of the Dauphin\u00c3\u00a9 in his deliberate manner and\nshrewd instincts of caution--once more shuffled out of the room, and St.\nGenis lapsed into a kind of pleasant torpor as the warmth of the fire\ngradually crept through his sinews and loosened all his limbs, while the\nanticipation of wine and food sent his wearied thoughts into a happy\nday-dream.\n\nTen minutes later he was installed before a substantial supper, and\nworthy Aristide Briot was equally satisfied with the two pieces of\nsilver which St. Genis had readily tendered him.\n\n\"You said your house was full, petit p\u00c3\u00a8re,\" said Maurice after a while,\nwhen the edge of his hunger had somewhat worn off. \"I shouldn't have\nthought there were many travellers in this out-of-the-way place.\"\n\n\"The place is not out-of-the-way,\" retorted the old man gruffly. \"The\nroad is a good one, and a short cut between Vienne and Chamb\u00c3\u00a9ry. We get\nplenty of travellers this way!\"\n\n\"Well! I did not strike the road, unfortunately. I saw your lights in\nthe distance and cut across some fields. It was pretty rough in the\ndark, I can tell you.\"\n\n\"That's just what those other cavaliers said, when they turned up here\nabout an hour ago. A noisy crowd they were. I had no room for them in my\nhouse, so they had to go.\"\n\nSt. Genis at once put down his knife and fork.\n\n\"A noisy crowd of travellers,\" he exclaimed, \"who arrived here an hour\nago?\"\n\n\"Parbleu!\" rejoined the other, \"and all wanting beds too. I had no room.\nI can only put up one or two travellers. I sent them on to Levasseur's,\nfurther along the road. Only the wounded man I could not turn away. He\nis up in our best bedroom.\"\n\n\"A wounded man? You have a wounded man here, petit p\u00c3\u00a8re?\"\n\n\"Oh! it's not much of a wound,\" explained the old man with unconscious\nirrelevance. \"He himself calls it a mere scratch. But my old woman took\na fancy to him: he is young and well-looking, you understand. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. She\nis clever at bandages too, so she has looked after him as if he were her\nown son.\"\n\nMechanically, St. Genis had once more taken up his knife and fork,\nthough of a truth the last of his hunger had vanished. But these\nDauphin\u00c3\u00a9 peasants were suspicious and queer-tempered, and already the\nyoung man's surprise had matured into a plan which he would not be able\nto carry through without the help of Aristide Briot. Noisy cavaliers--he\nmused to himself--a wounded man! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. wounded by the stray shot aimed\nat him by Crystal de Cambray! Indeed, St. Genis had much ado to keep his\nexcitement in check, and to continue with a pretence at eating while\nBriot watched him with stolid indifference.\n\n\"Petit p\u00c3\u00a8re,\" said the young man at last with as much unconcern as he\ncould affect. \"I have been thinking that you have--unwittingly--given me\nan excellent piece of news. I do believe that the man in your best\nbedroom upstairs is a friend of mine whom I was to have met at Lyons\nto-day and whose absence from our place of tryst had made me very\nanxious. I was imagining that all sorts of horrors had happened to him,\nfor he is in the secret service of the King and exposed to every kind of\ndanger. His being wounded in some skirmish either with highway robbers\nor with a band of the Corsican's pirates would not surprise me in the\nleast, and the fact that he had some half-dozen mounted men with him\nconfirms me in my belief that indeed it is my friend who is lying\nupstairs, as he often has to have an escort in the exercise of his\nduties. At any rate, petit p\u00c3\u00a8re,\" he concluded as he rose from the\ntable, \"by your leave, I'll go up and ascertain.\"\n\nWhile he rattled off these pretty proceeds of his own imagination,\nMaurice de St. Genis kept a sharp watch on Aristide Briot's face, ready\nto note the slightest sign of suspicion should it creep into the old\nman's shrewd eyes.\n\nBriot, however, did not exhibit any violent interest in his guest's\nstory, and when the latter had finished speaking he merely said,\npointing to the remnants of food upon the table:\n\n\"I thought you said that you were hungry.\"\n\n\"So I was, petit p\u00c3\u00a8re,\" rejoined Maurice impatiently, \"so I was: but my\nhunger is not so great as it was, and before I eat another morsel I must\nsatisfy myself that it is my friend who is safe and well in your old\nwoman's care.\"\n\n\"Oh! he is well enough,\" grunted Briot, \"and you can see him in the\nmorning.\"\n\n\"That I cannot, for I shall have to leave here soon after dawn. And I\ncould not get a wink of sleep whilst I am in such a state of uncertainty\nabout my friend.\"\n\n\"But you can't go and wake him now. He is asleep for sure, and my old\nwoman wouldn't like him to be disturbed, after all the care she has\ngiven him.\"\n\nSt. Genis, fretting with impatience, could have cursed aloud or shaken\nthe obstinate old peasant roughly by the shoulders.\n\n\"I shouldn't wake him,\" he retorted, irritated beyond measure at the\nman's futile opposition. \"I'll go up on tiptoe, candle in hand--you\nshall show me the way to his room--and I'll just ascertain whether the\nwounded man is my friend or not, then I'll come down again quietly and\nfinish my supper.\n\n\"Come, petit p\u00c3\u00a8re, I insist,\" he added more peremptorily, seeing that\nBriot--with the hesitancy peculiar to his kind--still made no movement\nto obey, but stood close by scratching his scanty locks and looking\npuzzled and anxious.\n\nFortunately for him Maurice understood the temperament of these peasants\nof the Dauphin\u00c3\u00a9, he knew that with their curious hesitancy and inherent\nsuspiciousness it was always the easiest to make up their minds for\nthem.\n\nSo now--since he was absolutely determined to come to grips with that\nabominable thief upstairs, before the night was many minutes older--he\nceased to parley with Briot.\n\nA candle stood close to his hand on the table, a bit of kindling wood\nlay in a heap in one corner, with the help of the one he lighted the\nother, then candle in hand he walked up to the door.\n\n\"Show me the way, petit p\u00c3\u00a8re,\" he said.\n\nAnd Aristide Briot, with a shrug of the shoulders which implied that he\nthere and then put away from him any responsibility for what might or\nmight not occur after this, and without further comment, led the way\nupstairs.\n\n\nII\n\nOn the upper landing at the top of the stairs Briot paused. He pointed\nto a door at the end of the narrow corridor, and said curtly:\n\n\"That's his room.\"\n\n\"I thank you, petit p\u00c3\u00a8re,\" whispered St. Genis in response. \"Don't wait\nfor me, I'll be back directly.\"\n\n\"He is not yet in bed,\" was Briot's dry comment.\n\nA thin streak of light showed underneath the door. As St. Genis walked\nrapidly toward it he wondered if the door would be locked. That\ncertainly was a contingency which had not occurred to him. His design\nwas to surprise a wounded and helpless thief in his sleep and to force\nhim then and there to give up the stolen money, before he had time to\ncall for help.\n\nBut the miscreant was evidently on the watch, Briot still lingered on\nthe top of the stairs, there were other people sleeping in the house,\nand St. Genis suddenly realised that his purpose would not be quite so\neasy of execution as he had hot-headedly supposed.\n\nBut the end in view was great, and St. Genis was not a man easily\ndeterred from a set purpose. There was the royalist cause to aid and\nCrystal to be won if he were successful.\n\nHe knocked resolutely at the door, then tried the latch. The door was\nlocked: but even as the young man hesitated for a moment wondering what\nhe would do next, a firm step resounded on the floor on the other side\nof the partition and the next moment the door was opened from within,\nand a peremptory voice issued the usual challenge:\n\n\"Who goes there?\"\n\nA tall figure appeared as a massive silhouette under the lintel. St.\nGenis had the candle in his hand. He dropped it in his astonishment.\n\n\"Mr. Clyffurde!\" he exclaimed.\n\nAt sight of St. Genis the Englishman, whose right arm was in a sling,\nhad made a quick instinctive movement back into the room, but equally\nquickly Maurice had forestalled him by placing his foot across the\nthreshold.\n\nThen he turned back to Aristide Briot.\n\n\"That's all right, petit p\u00c3\u00a8re,\" he called out airily, \"it is indeed my\nfriend, just as I thought. I'm going to stay and have a little chat with\nhim. Don't wait up for me. When he is tired of my company I'll go back\nto the parlour and make myself happy in front of the fire. Good-night!\"\n\nAs Clyffurde no longer stood in the doorway, St. Genis walked straight\ninto the room and closed the door behind him, leaving good old Aristide\nto draw what conclusions he chose from the eccentric behaviour of his\nnocturnal visitors.\n\nWith a rapid and wrathful gaze, St. Genis at once took stock of\neverything in the room. A sigh of satisfaction rose to his lips. At any\nrate the rogue could not deny his guilt. There, hanging on a peg, was\nthe caped coat which he had worn, and there on the table were two\ndamning proofs of his villainy--a pair of pistols and a black mask.\n\nThe whole situation puzzled him more than he could say. Certainly after\nthe first shock of surprise he had felt his wrath growing hotter and\nhotter every moment, the other man's cool assurance helped further to\nirritate his nerves, and to make him lose that self-control which would\nhave been of priceless value in this unlooked-for situation.\n\nSeeing that Maurice de St. Genis was absolutely speechless with surprise\nas well as with anger, there crept into Clyffurde's deep-set grey eyes a\nstrange look of amusement, as if the humour of his present position was\nmore obvious than its shame.\n\n\"And what,\" he asked pleasantly, \"has procured me the honour at this\nlate hour of a visit from M. le Marquis de St. Genis?\"\n\nHis words broke the spell. There was no longer any mystery in the\nsituation. The condemnatory pieces of evidence were there, Clyffurde's\nconnection with de Marmont was well known--the plot had become obvious.\nHere was an English adventurer--an alien spy--who had obviously been\npaid to do this dirty work for the usurper, and--as Maurice now\nconcluded airily--he must be made to give up the money which he had\nstolen before he be handed over to the military authorities at Lyons and\nshot as a spy or a thief--Maurice didn't care which: the whole thing was\nturning out far simpler and easier than he had dared to hope.\n\n\"You know quite well why I am here,\" he now said, roughly. \"Of a truth,\nfor the moment I was taken by surprise, for I had not thought that a man\nwho had been honoured by the friendship of M. le Comte de Cambray and of\nhis family was a thief, as well as a spy.\"\n\n\"And now,\" said Clyffurde, still smiling and apparently quite\nunperturbed, \"that you have been enlightened on this subject to your own\nsatisfaction, may I ask what you intend to do?\"\n\n\"Force you to give up what you have stolen, you impudent thief,\"\nretorted the other savagely.\n\n\"And how are you proposing to do that, M. de St. Genis?\" asked the\nEnglishman with perfect equanimity.\n\n\"Like this,\" cried Maurice, whose exasperation and fury had increased\nevery moment, as the other man's assurance waxed more insolent and more\ncool.\n\n\"Like this!\" he cried again, as he sprang at his enemy's throat.\n\nA past master in the art of self-defence, Clyffurde--despite his wounded\narm--was ready for the attack. With his left on guard he not only\nreceived the brunt of the onslaught, but parried it most effectually\nwith a quick blow against his assailant's jaw.\n\nSt. Genis--stunned by this forcible contact with a set of exceedingly\nhard knuckles--fell back a step or two, his foot struck against some\nobject on the floor, he lost his balance and measured his length\nbackwards across the bed.\n\n\"You abominable thief .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" he cried, choking with rage and\nwith discomfiture as he tried to struggle to his feet.\n\nBut this he at once found that he could not do, seeing that a pair of\nfirm and muscular knees were gripping and imprisoning his legs, even\nwhile that same all-powerful left hand with the hard knuckles had an\nunpleasant hold on his throat.\n\n\"I should have tried some other method, M. de St. Genis, had I been in\nyour shoes,\" came in irritatingly sarcastic accents from his calm\nantagonist.\n\nIndeed, the insolent rogue did not appear in the least overwhelmed by\nthe enormity of his crime or by the disgrace of being so ignominiously\nfound out. From his precarious position across the bed St. Genis had a\ngood view of the rascal's finely knit figure, of his earnest face, now\nsoftened by a smile full of kindly humour and good-natured contempt.\n\nAn impartial observer viewing the situation would certainly have thought\nthat here was an impudent villain vanquished and lying on his back,\nwhilst being admonished for his crimes by a just man who had might as\nwell as right on his side.\n\n\"Let me go, you confounded thief,\" St. Genis cried, as soon as the\nunpleasant grip on his throat had momentarily relaxed, \"you accursed spy\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Easy, easy, my young friend,\" said the other calmly; \"you have called\nme a thief quite often enough to satisfy your rage: and further epithets\nmight upset my temper.\"\n\n\"Let go my throat!\"\n\n\"I will in a moment or two, as soon as I have made up my mind what I am\ngoing to do with you, my impetuous young friend--whether I shall truss\nyou like a fowl and put you in charge of our worthy host, as guilty of\nassaulting one of his guests, or whether I shall do you some trifling\ninjury to punish you for trying to do me a grave one.\"\n\n\"Right is on my side,\" said St. Genis doggedly. \"I do not care what you\ndo to me.\"\n\n\"Right is apparently on your side, my friend. I'll not deny it.\nTherefore, I still hesitate.\"\n\n\"Like a rogue and a vagabond at dead of night you attacked and robbed\nthose who have never shown you anything but kindness.\"\n\n\"Until the hour when they turned me out of their house like a dishonest\nlacquey, without allowing me a word of explanation.\"\n\n\"Then this is your idea of vengeance, is it, Mr. Clyffurde?\"\n\n\"Yes, M. de St. Genis, it is. But not quite in the manner that you\nsuppose. I am going to set you free now in order to set your mind at\nrest. But let me warn you that I shall be just as much on the alert\nagainst another attack from you as ever I was before, and that I could\nward off two or even three assailants with my left arm and knee as\neasily as I warded off one. It is a way we have in England.\"\n\nHe relaxed his hold on Maurice's legs and throat, and the young\nman--fretting and fuming, wild with impotent wrath and with\nmortification--struggled to his feet.\n\n\"Are you proposing to give me some explanation to mitigate your crime?\"\nhe said roughly. \"If so, let me tell you that I will accept none.\nPutting the question aside of your abominable theft, you have committed\nan outrage against people whom I honour, and against the woman whom I\nlove.\"\n\n\"Nor do I propose to give you any explanation, M. de St. Genis,\"\nretorted Clyffurde, who still spoke quite quietly and evenly. \"But for\nthe sake of your own peace of mind, which you will I hope communicate to\nthe people whom you honour, I will tell you a few simple facts.\"\n\nNeither of the men sat down: they stood facing one another now across\nthe table whereon stood a couple of tallow candles which threw fitful,\nyellow lights on their faces--so different, so strangely\ncontrasted--young and well-looking both--both strongly moved by passion,\nyet one entirely self-controlled, while in the other's eyes that passion\nglowed fierce and resentful.\n\n\"I listen,\" said St. Genis curtly.\n\nAnd Clyffurde began after a slight pause: \"At the time that you fell\nupon me with such ill-considered vigour, M. de St. Genis,\" he said, \"did\nyou know that but for my abominable outrage upon the persons whom you\nhonour, the money which they would gladly have guarded with their life\nwould have fallen into the hands of Bonaparte's agents?\"\n\n\"In theirs or yours, what matters?\" retorted St. Genis savagely, \"since\nHis Majesty is deprived of it now.\"\n\n\"That is where you are mistaken, my young friend,\" said the other\nquietly. \"His Majesty is more sure of getting the money now than he was\nwhen M. le Comte de Cambray with his family and yourself started on that\nquixotic if ill-considered errand this morning.\"\n\nSt. Genis frowned in puzzlement:\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" he said curtly.\n\n\"Isn't it simple enough? You and your friends credited me with\nfriendship for de Marmont: he is hot-headed and impetuous, and words\nrush out of his mouth that he should keep to himself. I knew from\nhimself that Bonaparte had charged him to recover the twenty-five\nmillions which M. le pr\u00c3\u00a9fet Fourier had placed in the Comte de Cambray's\ncharge.\"\n\n\"Why did you not warn the Comte then?\" queried St. Genis, who, still\nmistrustful, glowered at his antagonist.\n\n\"Would he have listened to me, think you?\" asked the other with a quiet\nsmile. \"Remember, he had turned me out of his house two nights before,\nwithout a word of courtesy or regret--on the mere suspicion of my\nintercourse with de Marmont. Were you too full with your own rage to\nnotice what happened then? Mlle. Crystal drew away her skirts from me as\nif I were a leper. What credence would they have given my words? Would\nthe Comte even have admitted me into his presence?\"\n\n\"And so .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you planned this robbery .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" stammered St.\nGenis, whose astonishment and puzzlement were rendering him as\nspeechless as his rage had done. \"I'll not believe it,\" he continued\nmore firmly; \"you are fooling me, now that I have found you out.\"\n\n\"Why should I do that? You are in my hands, and not I in yours.\nBonaparte is victorious at Grenoble. I could take the money to him and\nearn his gratitude, or use the money for mine own ends. What have I to\nfear from you? What cause to fool you? Your opinion of me? M. le Comte's\ncontempt or goodwill? Bah! after to-night are we likely to meet again?\"\n\nSt. Genis said nothing in reply. Of a truth there was nothing that he\ncould say. The Englishman's whole attitude bore the impress of truth.\nEven through that still seething wrath which refused to be appeased, St.\nGenis felt that the other was speaking the truth. His mind now was in\nturmoil of wonderment. This man who stood here before him had done\nsomething which he--St. Genis--could not comprehend. Vaguely he realised\nthat beneath the man's actions there still lay a yet deeper foundation\nof dignity and of heroism and one which perhaps would never be wholly\nfathomed.\n\nIt was Clyffurde who at last broke the silence between them:\n\n\"You, M. de St. Genis,\" he said lightly, \"would under like circumstances\nhave acted just as I did, I am sure. The whole idea was so easy of\nexecution. Half a dozen loafers to aid me, the part of highwayman to\nplay--an old man and two or three defenceless women--my part was not\nheroic, I admit,\" he added with a smile, \"but it has served its purpose.\nThe money is safe in my keeping now, within a few days His Majesty the\nKing of France shall have it, and all those who strive to serve him\nloyally can rest satisfied.\"\n\n\"I confess I don't understand you,\" said St. Genis, as he seemed to\nshake himself free from some unexplainable spell that held him. \"You\nhave rendered us and the legitimate cause of France a signal service!\nWhy did you do it?\"\n\n\"You forget, M. de St. Genis, that the legitimate cause of France is\nEngland's cause as well.\"\n\n\"Are you a servant of your country then? I thought you were a tradesman\nengaged in buying gloves.\"\n\nClyffurde smiled. \"So I am,\" he said, \"but even a tradesman may serve\nhis country, if he has the opportunity.\"\n\n\"I hope that your country will be duly grateful,\" said Maurice, with a\nsigh. \"I know that every royalist in France would thank you if they\nknew.\"\n\n\"By your leave, M. de St. Genis, no one in France need know anything but\nwhat you choose to tell them. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"You mean .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"That except for reassuring M. le Comte de Cambray and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and Mlle.\nCrystal, there is no reason why they should ever know what passed\nbetween us in this room to-night.\"\n\n\"But if the King is to have the money, he .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"He will never know from me, from whence it comes.\"\n\n\"He will wish to know. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Come, M. de St. Genis,\" broke in Clyffurde, with a slight hint of\nimpatience, \"is it for me to tell you that Great Britain has more than\none agent in France these days--that the money will reach His Majesty\nthe King ultimately through the hands of his foreign minister M. le\nComte de Jaucourt .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and that my name will never appear in connection\nwith the matter? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I am a mere servant of Great Britain--doing my\nduty where I can .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. nothing more.\"\n\n\"You mean that you are in the British Secret Service? No?--Well! I don't\nprofess to understand you English people, and you seem to me more\nincomprehensible than any I have known. Not that I ever believed that\nyou were a mere tradesman. But what shall I say to M. le Comte de\nCambray?\" he added, after a slight pause, during which a new and strange\ntrain of thought altered the expression of wonderment on his face, to\none that was undefinable, almost furtive, certainly undecided.\n\n\"All you need say to M. le Comte,\" replied Clyffurde, with a slight tone\nof impatience, \"is that you are personally satisfied that the money will\nreach His Majesty's hand safely, and in due course. At least, I presume\nthat you are satisfied, M. de St. Genis,\" he continued, vaguely\nwondering what was going on in the young Frenchman's brain.\n\n\"Yes, yes, of course I am satisfied,\" murmured the other, \"but .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"Mlle. Crystal would want to know something more than that. She will ask\nme questions .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. she .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. she will insist .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I had promised her to\nget the money back myself .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. she will expect an explanation .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nshe .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHe continued to murmur these short, jerky sentences almost inaudibly,\navoiding the while to meet the enquiring and puzzled gaze of the\nEnglishman.\n\nWhen he paused--still murmuring, but quite inaudibly now--Clyffurde made\nno comment, and once more there fell a silence over the narrow room. The\ncandles flickered feebly, and Bobby picked up the metal snuffers from\nthe table and with a steady and deliberate hand set to work to trim the\nwicks.\n\nSo absorbed did he seem in this occupation that he took no notice of St.\nGenis, who with arms crossed in front of him, was pacing up and down the\nnarrow room, a heavy frown between his deep-set eyes.\n\n\nIII\n\nSomewhere in the house down below, an old-fashioned clock had just\nstruck two. Clyffurde looked up from his absorbing task.\n\n\"It is late,\" he remarked casually; \"shall we say good-night, M. de St.\nGenis?\"\n\nThe sound of the Englishman's voice seemed to startle Maurice out of his\nreverie. He pulled himself together, walked firmly up to the table and\nresting his hand upon it, he faced the other man with a sudden gaze made\nup partly of suddenly conceived resolve and partly of lingering\nshamefacedness.\n\n\"Mr. Clyffurde,\" he began abruptly.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Have you any cause to hate me?\"\n\n\"Why no,\" replied Clyffurde with his habitual good-humoured smile. \"Why\nshould I have?\"\n\n\"Have you any cause to hate Mlle. Crystal de Cambray?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"You have no desire,\" insisted Maurice, \"to be revenged on her for the\nslight which she put upon you the other night?\"\n\nHis voice had grown more steady and his look more determined as he put\nthese rapid questions to Clyffurde, whose expressive face showed no sign\nof any feeling in response save that of complete and indifferent\npuzzlement.\n\n\"I have no desire with regard to Mlle. de Cambray,\" replied Bobby\nquietly, \"save that of serving her, if it be in my power.\"\n\n\"You can serve her, Sir,\" retorted Maurice firmly, \"and that right\nnobly. You can render the whole of her future life happy beyond what she\nherself has ever dared to hope.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\nMaurice paused: once more, with a gesture habitual to him, he crossed\nhis arms over his chest and resumed his restless march up and down the\nnarrow room.\n\nThen again he stood still, and again faced the Englishman, his dark\nenquiring eyes seeming to probe the latter's deepest thoughts.\n\n\"Did you know, Mr. Clyffurde,\" he asked slowly, \"that Mlle. Crystal de\nCambray honours me with her love?\"\n\n\"Yes. I knew that,\" replied the other quietly.\n\n\"And I love her with my heart and soul,\" continued Maurice impetuously.\n\"Oh! I cannot tell you what we have suffered--she and I--when the\nexigencies of her position and the will of her father parted\nus--seemingly for ever. Her heart was broken and so was mine: and I\nendured the tortures of hell when I realised at last that she was lost\nto me for ever and that her exquisite person--her beautiful soul--were\ndestined for the delight of that low-born traitor Victor de Marmont.\"\n\nHe drew breath, for he had half exhausted himself with the volubility\nand vehemence of his diction. Also he seemed to be waiting for some\nencouragement from Clyffurde, who, however, gave him none, but sat\nunmoved and apparently supremely indifferent, while a suffering heart\nwas pouring out its wails of agony into his unresponsive ear.\n\n\"The reason,\" resumed St. Genis somewhat more calmly, \"why M. le Comte\nde Cambray was opposed to our union, was purely a financial one. Our\nfamilies are of equal distinction and antiquity, but alas! our fortunes\nare also of equal precariousness: we, Sir, of the old noblesse gave up\nour all, in order to follow our King into exile. Victor de Marmont was\nrich. His fortune could have repurchased the ancient Cambray estates and\nrestored to that honoured name all the brilliance which it had\nsacrificed for its principles.\"\n\nStill Clyffurde remained irritatingly silent, and St. Genis asked him\nsomewhat tartly:\n\n\"I trust I am making myself clear, Sir?\"\n\n\"Perfectly, so far,\" replied the other quietly, \"but I am afraid I don't\nquite see how you propose that I could serve Mlle. Crystal in all this.\"\n\n\"You can with one word, one generous action, Sir, put me in a position\nto claim Crystal as my wife, and give her that happiness which she\ncraves for, and which is rightly her due.\"\n\nA slight lifting of the eyebrows was Clyffurde's only comment.\n\n\"Mr. Clyffurde,\" now said Maurice, with the obvious firm resolve to end\nhis own hesitancy at last, \"you say yourself that by taking this money\nto His Majesty, or rather to his minister, you, individually, will get\nneither glory nor even gratitude--your name will not appear in the\ntransaction at all. I am quoting your own words, remember. That is so,\nis it not?\"\n\n\"It is so--certainly.\"\n\n\"But, Sir, if a Frenchman--a royalist--were able to render his King so\nsignal a service, he would not only gain gratitude, but recognition and\nglory. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. A man who was poor and obscure would at once become rich\nand distinguished. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"And in a position to marry the woman he loved,\" concluded Bobby,\nsmiling.\n\nThen as Maurice said nothing, but continued to regard him with glowing,\nanxious eyes, he added, smiling not altogether kindly this time,\n\n\"I think I understand, M. de St. Genis.\"\n\n\"And .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. what do you say?\" queried the other excitedly.\n\n\"Let me make the situation clear first, as I understand it, Monsieur,\"\ncontinued Bobby drily. \"You are--and I mistake not--suggesting at the\npresent moment that I should hand over the twenty-five millions to you,\nin order that you should take them yourself to the King in Paris, and by\nthis act obtain not only favours from him, but probably a goodly share\nof the money, which you--presumably--will have forced some unknown\nhighwayman to give up to you. Is that it?\"\n\n\"It was not money for myself I thought of, Sir,\" murmured St. Genis\nsomewhat shamefacedly.\n\n\"No, no, of course not,\" rejoined Clyffurde with a tone of sarcasm quite\nforeign to his usual easy-going good-nature. \"You were thinking of the\nKing's favours, and of a future of distinction and glory.\"\n\n\"I was thinking chiefly of Crystal, Sir,\" said the other haughtily.\n\n\"Quite so. You were thinking of winning Mlle. Crystal by a .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. a\nsubterfuge.\"\n\n\"An innocent one, Sir, you will admit. I should not be robbing you in\nany way. And remember that it is only Crystal's hand that is denied me:\nher love I have already won.\"\n\nA look of pain--quickly suppressed and easily hidden from the other's\nself-absorbed gaze--crossed the Englishman's earnest face.\n\n\"I do remember that, Monsieur,\" he said, \"else I certainly would never\nlend a hand in the .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. subterfuge.\"\n\n\"You will do it then?\" queried the other eagerly.\n\n\"I have not said so.\"\n\n\"Ah! but you will,\" pleaded Maurice hotly. \"Sir! the eternal gratitude\nof two faithful hearts would be yours always--for Crystal will know it\nall, once we are married, I promise you that she will. And in the midst\nof her happiness she will find time to bless your generosity and your\nselflessness .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. whilst I .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Enough, I beg of you, M. de St. Genis,\" broke in Clyffurde now, with\nangry impatience. \"Believe me! I do not hug myself with any thought of\nmy own virtues, nor do I desire any gratitude from you: if I hand over\nthe money to you, it is sorely against my better judgment and distinctly\nagainst my duty: but since that duty chiefly lies in being assured that\nthe King of France will receive the money safely, why then by handing it\nover to you I have that assurance, and my conscience will rest at\ncomparative ease. You shall have the money, Sir, and you shall marry\nMlle. Crystal on the strength of the King's gratitude towards you. And\nMlle. Crystal will be happy--if you keep silence over this transaction.\nBut for God's sake let's say no more about it: for of a truth you and I\nare playing but a sorry r\u00c3\u00b4le this night.\"\n\n\"A sorry r\u00c3\u00b4le?\" protested the other.\n\n\"Yes, a sorry r\u00c3\u00b4le. Are you not deceiving a woman? Am I not running\ncounter to my duty?\"\n\n\"I but deceive Crystal temporarily. I love her and only deceive in order\nto win her. The end justifies the means: Nor do you, in my opinion, run\ncounter to your duty. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nBut Clyffurde interrupted him roughly: \"I pray you, Sir, make no comment\non mine actions. My own silent comments on these are hard enough to\nbear: your eulogies would raise bounds to my patience.\"\n\nWhereupon he walked quickly up to the bed and from under the mattress\nextricated five leather wallets which he threw one by one upon the\ntable.\n\n\"Here is the King's money,\" he said curtly; \"you could never have taken\nit from me by force, but I give it over to you willingly now. If within\na week from now I hear that the King has not received it, I will\nproclaim you a liar and a thief.\"\n\n\"Sir .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you dare .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Nay! we'll not quarrel. I don't want to do you any hurt. You know from\nexperience that I could kill you or wring your neck as easily as you\ncould kill a child; but Mlle. Crystal's love is like a protecting shield\nall round you, so I'll not touch you again. But don't ask me to measure\nmy words, for that is beyond my power. Take the money, M. de St. Genis,\nand earn not only the King's gratitude but also Mlle. Crystal's, which\nis far better worth having. And now, I pray you, leave me to rest. You\nmust be tired too. And our mutual company hath become irksome to us\nboth.\"\n\nHe turned his back on St. Genis and sat down at the table, drawing\npaper, pen and inkhorn toward him, and with clumsy, left hand began\nlaboriously to form written characters, as if St. Genis' presence or\ndeparture no longer concerned him.\n\nAn importunate beggar could not have been more humiliatingly dismissed.\nSt. Genis had flushed to the very roots of his hair. He would have given\nmuch to be able to chastise the insolent Englishman then and there. But\nthe latter had not boasted when he said that he could wring Maurice's\nneck as easily with his left hand as with his right, and Maurice within\nhis heart was bound to own that the boast was no idle one. He knew that\nin a hand-to-hand fight he was no match for that heavy-framed,\nhard-fisted product of a fog-ridden land.\n\nHe would not trust himself to speak any more, lest another word cause\nprudence to yield to exasperation. Another moment of hesitation, a shrug\nof the shoulders--perhaps a muttered curse or two--and St. Genis picked\nup one by one the wallets from the table.\n\nClyffurde never looked up while he did so: he continued to form awkward,\nillegible characters upon the paper before him, as if his very life\ndepended on being able to write with his left hand.\n\nThe next moment St. Genis had walked rapidly out of the room. Bobby left\noff writing, threw down his pen, and resting his elbow upon the table\nand his head in his hand, he remained silent and motionless while St.\nGenis' quick and firm footsteps echoed first along the corridor, then\ndown the creaking stairs and finally on the floor below. After which\nthere came the sound of the opening and shutting of a door, the dragging\nof a chair across a wooden floor, and nothing more.\n\nAll was still in the house at last. The old-fashioned clock downstairs\nstruck half-past two.\n\nWith a smothered cry of angry contempt Clyffurde seized on the papers\nthat lay scattered on the table and crushed them up in his hand with a\ngesture of passionate wrath.\n\nThen he strode up to the window, threw open the rickety casement and let\nthe pure cold air of night pour into the room and dissipate the\natmosphere of cowardice, of falsehood and of unworthy love that still\nseemed to hang there where M. le Marquis de St. Genis had basely\nbargained for his own ends, and outraged the very name of Love by\nplanning base deeds in its name.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE CRIME\n\n\nI\n\nVictor de Marmont had spent that same night in wearisome agitation. His\nmortification and disappointment would not allow him to rest.\n\nHe had brought his squad of cavalry up as far as St. Priest, which lies\na little off the main road, about half-way between Lyons and the scene\nof de Marmont's late discomfiture. Here he and his men had spent the\nnight, only to make a fresh start early the next morning--back for\nGrenoble--seeing that M. le Comte d'Artois with thirty or forty thousand\ntroops was even now at Lyons.\n\nWhen, an hour after leaving St. Priest, the little troop came upon a\nsolitary horseman, riding a heavy carriage horse with a postillion's\nbridle, de Marmont at first had no other thought save that of malicious\npleasure at recognising the man, whom just now he hated more cordially\nthan any other man in the world.\n\nM. de St. Genis--for indeed it was he--was peremptorily challenged and\nquestioned, and his wrath and impotent attempts at arrogance greatly\ndelighted de Marmont.\n\nTo make oneself actively unpleasant to a rival is apt to be a very\npleasurable sensation. Victor had an exceedingly disagreeable half-hour\nto avenge and to declare St. Genis a prisoner of war, to order his\nremoval to Grenoble pending the Emperor's pleasure, to command him to\nbe silent when he desired to speak was so much soothing balsam spread\nupon the wounds which his own pride had suffered at Brestalou last\nSunday eve.\n\nIt was not until a casual remark from the sergeant under his command\ncaused him to notice the bulging pockets of St. Genis' coat, that Victor\nthought to give the order to search the prisoner.\n\nThe latter entered a vigorous protest: he fought and he threatened: he\npromised de Marmont the hangman's rope and his men terrible reprisals,\nbut of course he was fighting a losing battle. He was alone against five\nand twenty, his first attempt at getting hold of the pistols in his belt\nwas met with a threat of summary execution: he was dragged out of the\nsaddle, his arms were forced behind his back, while rough hands turned\nout the precious contents of his coat-pockets! All that he could do was\nto curse fate which had brought these pirates on his way, and his own\nshort-sightedness and impatience in not waiting for the armed patrol\nwhich undoubtedly would have been sent out to him from Lyons in response\nto M. le Comte de Cambray's request.\n\nNow he had the deadly chagrin and bitter disappointment of seeing the\nmoney which he had wrested from Clyffurde last night at the price of so\nmuch humiliation, transferred to the pockets of a real thief and\nspoliator who would either keep it for himself or--what in the\nenthusiastic royalist's eyes would be even worse--place it at the\nservice of the Corsican usurper. He could hardly believe in the reality\nof his ill luck, so appalling was it. In one moment he saw all the hopes\nof which he had dreamed last night fly beyond recall. He had lost\nCrystal more effectually, more completely than he ever had done before.\nIf the Englishman ever spoke of what had occurred last night .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. if\nCrystal ever knew that he had been fool enough to lose the treasure\nwhich had been in his possession for a few hours--her contempt would\ncrush the love which she had for him: nor would the Comte de Cambray\never relent.\n\nDe Marmont's triumph too was hard to bear: his clumsy irony was terribly\ngalling.\n\n\"Would M. le Marquis de St. Genis care to continue his journey to Lyons\nnow? would he prefer not to go to Grenoble?\"\n\nSt. Genis bit his tongue with the determination to remain silent.\n\n\"M. de St. Genis is free to go whither he chooses.\"\n\nThe permission was not even welcome. Maurice would as lief be taken\nprisoner and dragged back to Grenoble as face Crystal with the story of\nhis failure.\n\nQuite mechanically he remounted, and pulled his horse to one side while\nde Marmont ordered his little squad to form once more, and after the\nbrief word of command and a final sarcastic farewell, galloped off up\nthe road back toward Lyons at the head of his men, not waiting to see if\nSt. Genis came his way too or not.\n\nThe latter with wearied, aching eyes gazed after the fast disappearing\ntroop, until they became a mere speck on the long, straight road, and\nthe distant morning mist finally swallowed them up.\n\nThen he too turned his horse's head in the same direction back toward\nLyons once more, and allowing the reins to hang loosely in his hand, and\nletting his horse pick its own slow way along the road, he gave himself\nover to the gloominess of his own thoughts.\n\n\nII\n\nHe too had some difficulty in entering the town. M. le Duc d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans,\ncousin of the King, had just arrived to support M. le Comte d'Artois,\nand together these two royal princes had framed and posted up a\nproclamation to the brave Lyonese of the National Guard.\n\nThe whole city was in a turmoil, for M. le Duc d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans--who was\nnothing if not practical--had at once declared that there was not the\nslightest chance of a successful defence of Lyons, and that by far the\nbest thing to do would be to withdraw the troops while they were still\nloyal.\n\nM. le Comte d'Artois protested; at any rate he wouldn't do anything so\ndrastic till after the arrival of Marshal Macdonald, to whom he had sent\nan urgent courier the day before, enjoining him to come to Lyons without\ndelay. In the meanwhile he and his royal cousin did all they could to\nkindle or at any rate to keep up the loyalty of the troops, but\ndefection was already in the air: here and there the men had been seen\nto throw their white cockades into the mud, and more than one cry of\n\"Vive l'Empereur!\" had risen even while Monsieur himself was reviewing\nthe National Guard on the Place Bellecour.\n\nThe bridge of La Guilloti\u00c3\u00a8re was stoutly barricaded, but as St. Genis\nwaited out in the open road while his name was being taken to the\nofficer in command he saw crowds of people standing or walking up and\ndown on the opposite bank of the river.\n\nThey were waiting for the Emperor, the news of whose approach was\nfilling the townspeople with glee.\n\nHeartsick and wretched, St. Genis, after several hours of weary waiting,\ndid ultimately obtain permission to enter the city by the ferry on the\nsouth side of the city. Once inside Lyons, he had no difficulty in\nascertaining where such a distinguished gentleman as M. le Comte de\nCambray had put up for the night, and he promptly made his way to the\nHotel Bourbon, his mind, at this stage, still a complete blank as to how\nhe would explain his discomfiture to the Comte and to Crystal.\n\nIn the present state of M. le Comte d'Artois' difficulties the money\nwould have been thrice welcome, and St. Genis felt the load of failure\nweighing thrice as heavily on his soul, and dreaded the\nreproaches--mute or outspoken--which he knew awaited him. If only he\ncould have thought of something! something plausible and not too\ninglorious! There was, of course, the possibility that he had failed to\ncome upon the track of the thieves at all--but then he had no business\nto come back so soon--and he didn't want to come back, only that there\nwas always the likelihood of the Englishman speaking of what had\noccurred--not necessarily with evil intent .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. some words of\nhis: \"If within a week I hear that the King of France has not received\nthis money, I will proclaim you a liar and a thief!\" rang unpleasantly\nin St. Genis' ears.\n\nThe young man's mind, I repeat, was at this point still a blank as to\nwhat explanation he would give to the Comte de Cambray of his own\nmiserable failure.\n\nHe was returning--after an ardent promise to overtake the thief and to\nforce him to give up the money--without apparently having made any\neffort in that direction--or having made the effort, failing signally\nand ignominiously--a foolish and unheroic position in either case.\n\nTo tell the whole unvarnished truth, his interview with Clyffurde and\nhis thoughtlessness in wandering along the road all alone, laden with\ntwenty-five million francs, not waiting for the arrival of M. le Comte\nd'Artois' patrol, was unthinkable.\n\nThen what? St. Genis, determined not to tell the truth, found it a\ndifficult task to concoct a story that would be plausible and at the\nsame time redound to his credit. His disappointment was so bitter now,\nhis hopes of winning Crystal and glory had been so bright, that he found\nit quite impossible to go back to the hard facts of life--to his own\npoverty and the unattainableness of Crystal de Cambray--without making a\ngreat effort to win back what Victor de Marmont had just wrested from\nhim.\n\nThrough the whirl of his thoughts, too, there was a vague sense of\nresentment against Clyffurde--coupled with an equally vague sense of\nfear. He, Maurice, might easily keep silent over the transaction of last\nnight, but Clyffurde might not feel inclined to do so. He would want to\nknow sooner or later what had become of the money .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. had he not\nuttered a threat which made Maurice's cheeks even now flush with wrath\nand shame?\n\nCertain words and gestures of the Englishman had stood out before\nMaurice's mind in a way that had stirred up those latent jealousies\nwhich always lurk in the heart of an unsuccessful wooer. Clyffurde had\nbeen generous--blind to his own interests--ready to sacrifice what\nrecognition he had earned: he had spared his assailant and agreed to an\nunworthy subterfuge, and St. Genis' tormented brain began to wonder why\nhe had done all this.\n\nWas it for love of Crystal de Cambray?\n\nSt. Genis would not allow himself to answer that question, for he felt\nthat if he did he would hate that hard-fisted Englishman more thoroughly\nthan he had ever hated any man before--not excepting de Marmont. De\nMarmont was an evil and vile traitor who never could cross Crystal's\npath of life again. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. But not so the Englishman, who had planned to\nserve her and who would have succeeded so magnificently but for\nhis--Maurice's--interference!\n\nIf this explanation of Clyffurde's strangely magnanimous conduct was the\ntrue one, then indeed St. Genis felt that he would have everything to\nfear from him. For indeed was it so very unlikely that the Englishman\nwas throughout acting in collusion with Victor de Marmont, who was known\nto be his friend?\n\nWas it so very unlikely that--seeing himself unmasked--he had found a\nsure and rapid way of allowing the money to pass through St. Genis'\nhands into those of de Marmont, and at the same time hopelessly\nhumiliating and discrediting his rival in the affections of Mlle. de\nCambray?\n\nThat the suggestion of handing the money over to him had come originally\nfrom Maurice de St. Genis himself, the young man did not trouble himself\nto remember. The more he thought this new explanation of past events\nover, the more plausible did it seem and the more likely of acceptance\nby M. le Comte de Cambray and by Crystal, and St. Genis at last saw his\nway to appearing before them not only zealous but heroic--even if\nunfortunate--and it was with a much lightened heart that he finally drew\nrein outside the Hotel Bourbon.\n\n\nIII\n\nM. le Comte de Cambray, it seems, was staying at the Hotel for a few\ndays, so the proprietor informed M. de St. Genis. M. le Comte had gone\nout, but Mme. la Duchesse d'Agen was upstairs with Mlle. de Cambray.\n\nWith somewhat uncertain step St. Genis followed the obsequious\nproprietor, who had insisted on conducting M. le Marquis to the ladies'\napartments himself. They occupied a suite of rooms on the first floor,\nand after a timid knock at the door, it was opened by Jeanne from\nwithin, and Maurice found himself in the presence of Crystal and of the\nDuchesse and obliged at once to enter upon the explanation which, with\ntheir first cry of surprise, they already asked of him.\n\n\"Well!\" exclaimed Crystal eagerly, \"what news?\"\n\n\"Of the money?\" murmured Maurice vaguely, who above all things was\nanxious to gain time.\n\n\"Yes! the King's money!\" rejoined the girl with slight impatience. \"Have\nyou tracked the thieves? Do you know where they are? Is there any hope\nof catching them?\"\n\n\"None, I am afraid,\" he replied firmly.\n\nCrystal gave a cry of bitter disappointment and reproach. \"Then,\nMaurice,\" she exclaimed almost involuntarily, \"why are you here?\"\n\nAnd Mme. la Duchesse, folding her mittened hands before her, seemed\nmutely to be asking the same question.\n\n\"But did you come upon the thieves at all?\" continued Crystal with eager\nvolubility. \"Where did they go to for the night? You must have come on\nsome traces of their passage. Oh!\" she added vehemently, \"you ought not\nto have deserted your post like this!\"\n\n\"What could I do,\" he murmured. \"I was all alone .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. against so many.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"You said that you would get on the track of the thieves,\" she urged,\n\"and father told you that he would speak with M. le Comte d'Artois as\nsoon as possible. Monsieur has promised that an armed patrol would be\nsent out to you, and would be on the lookout for you on the road.\"\n\n\"An armed patrol would be no use. I came back on purpose to stop one\nbeing sent.\"\n\n\"But why, in Heaven's name?\" exclaimed the Duchesse.\n\n\"Because a troop of deserters with that traitor Victor de Marmont is\nscouring the road, and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"We know that,\" said Crystal, \"we were stopped by them last night, after\nyou left us. They were after the money for the usurper, who had sent\nthem, and I thanked God that twenty-five millions had enriched a common\nthief rather than the Corsican brigand.\"\n\n\"Surely, Maurice,\" said the Duchesse with her usual tartness, \"you were\nnot fool enough to allow the King's money to fall into that abominable\nde Marmont's hands?\"\n\n\"How could I help it?\" now exclaimed the young man, as if driven to the\nextremity of despair. \"The whole thing was a huge plot beyond one man's\npower to cope with. I tracked the thieves,\" he continued with vehemence\nas eager as Crystal's, \"I tracked them to a lonely hostelry off the\nbeaten track--at dead of night--a den of cutthroats and conspirators. I\ntracked the thief to his lair and forced him to give the money up to\nme.\"\n\n\"You forced him? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Oh! how splendid!\" cried Crystal. \"But then\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Ah, then! there was the hideousness of the plot. The thief, feeling\nhimself unmasked, gave up his stolen booty; I forced him to his knees,\nand five wallets containing twenty-five million francs were safely in my\npockets at last.\"\n\n\"You forced him--how splendid!\" reiterated Crystal, whose glowing eyes\nwere fixed upon Maurice with all the admiration which she felt.\n\n\"Yes! that money was in my pocket for the rest of the happy night, but\nthe abominable thief knew well that his friend Victor de Marmont was on\nthe road with five and twenty armed deserters in the pay of the Corsican\nbrigand. Hardly had I left the hostelry and found my way back to the\nmain road when I was surrounded, assailed, searched and robbed. I\nrepeat!\" continued St. Genis, warming to his own narrative, \"what could\nI do alone against so many?--the thief and his hirelings I managed\nsuccessfully, but with the money once in my possession I could not risk\nstaying an hour longer than I could help in that den of cutthroats. But\nthey were in league with de Marmont, and, though I would have guarded\nthe King's money with my life, it was filched from me ere I could draw a\nsingle weapon in its defence.\"\n\nHe had sunk in a chair, half exhausted with the effort of his own\neloquence, and now, with elbows resting on his knees and head buried in\nhis hands, he looked the picture of heroic misery.\n\nCrystal said nothing for a while; there was a deep frown of puzzlement\nbetween her eyes.\n\n\"Maurice,\" she said resolutely at last, \"you said just now that the\nthief was in collusion with his friend de Marmont. What did you mean by\nthat?\"\n\n\"I would rather that you guessed what I meant, Crystal,\" replied Maurice\nwithout looking up at her.\n\n\"You mean .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. that .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" she began slowly.\n\n\"That it was Mr. Clyffurde, our English friend,\" broke in Madame tartly,\n\"who robbed us on the broad highway. I suspected it all along.\"\n\n\"You suspected it, _ma tante_, and said nothing?\" asked the girl, who\nobviously had not taken in the full significance of Maurice's statement.\n\n\"I said absolutely nothing,\" replied Madame decisively, \"firstly,\nbecause I did not think that I would be doing any good by putting my own\nsurmises into my brother's head, and, secondly, because I must confess\nthat I thought that nice young Englishman had acted pour le bon motif.\"\n\n\"How could you think that, _ma tante_?\" ejaculated Crystal hotly: \"a\ngood motive? to rob us at dead of night--he, a friend of Victor de\nMarmont--an adherent of the Corsican! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Englishmen are not adherents of the Corsican, my dear,\" retorted Madame\ndrily, \"and until Maurice's appearance this morning, I was satisfied\nthat the money would ultimately reach His Majesty's own hands.\"\n\n\"But we were taking the money to His Majesty ourselves.\"\n\n\"And Victor de Marmont was after it. Mr. Clyffurde may have known that.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Remember, my dear,\" continued Madame, \"that these were my\nimpressions last night. Maurice's account of the den of cutthroats has\nmodified these entirely.\"\n\nAgain Crystal was silent. The frown had darkened on her face: there was\na line of bitter resentment round her lips--a look of contempt, of hate,\nof a desire to hurt, in her eyes.\n\n\"Maurice,\" she said abruptly at last.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I did wound that thief, did I not?\"\n\n\"Yes. In the shoulder .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. it gave me a slight advantage .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" he said\nwith affected modesty.\n\n\"I am glad. And you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you were able to punish him too, I hope.\"\n\n\"Yes. I punished him.\"\n\nHe was watching her very closely, for inwardly he had been wondering how\nshe had taken his news. She was strangely agitated, so Maurice's\ntroubled, jealous heart told him; her face was flushed, her eyes were\nwet and a tiny lace handkerchief which she twisted between her fingers\nwas nothing but a damp rag.\n\n\"Oh! I hate him! I hate him!\" she murmured as with an impatient gesture\nshe brushed the gathering tears from her eyes. \"Father had been so kind\nto him--so were we all. How could he? how could he?\"\n\n\"His duty, I suppose,\" said St. Genis magnanimously.\n\n\"His duty?\" she retorted scornfully.\n\n\"To the cause which he served.\"\n\n\"Duty to a usurper, a brigand, the enemy of his country. Was he, then,\npaid to serve the Corsican?\"\n\n\"Probably.\"\n\n\"His being in trade--buying gloves at Grenoble--was all a plant then?\"\n\n\"I am afraid so,\" said St. Genis, who much against his will now was\nsinking ever deeper and deeper in the quagmire of lying and cowardice\ninto which he had allowed himself to drift.\n\n\"And he was nothing better than a spy!\"\n\nNo one, not even Crystal herself, could have defined with what feelings\nshe said this. Was it solely contempt? or did a strange mixture of\nregret and sorrow mingle with the scorn which she felt? Swiftly her\nthoughts had flown back to that Sunday evening--a very few days\nago--when the course of her destiny was so suddenly changed once more,\nwhen her marriage with a man whom she could never love was broken off,\nwhen the possibilities once more rose upon the horizon of her life, of a\nrenewed existence of poverty and exile in the wake of a dispossessed\nking.\n\nThat same evening a man whom she had hardly noticed before--a man\nneither of her own nationality nor of her own caste--this same\nEnglishman, Clyffurde, had entered into her life--not violently or\naggressively, but just with a few words of intense sympathy and with a\ngenuine offer of friendship; and she somehow, despite much kindness\nwhich encompassed her always, had felt cheered and warmed by his words,\nand a strange and sweet sense of security against hurt and sorrow had\nentered her heart as she listened to them.\n\nAnd now she knew that all that was false--false his sympathy, false his\noffers of friendship--his words were false, his hand-grasp false.\nTreachery lurked behind that kindly look in his eyes, and falsehood\nbeneath his smile.\n\n\"He was nothing better than a spy!\" The sting of that thought hurt her\nmore than she could have thought possible. She had so few real friends\nand this one had proved a sham. Had she been alone she would have given\nway to tears, but before Maurice or even her aunt she was ashamed of her\ngrief, ashamed of her feelings and of her thoughts. There was a great\ndeal yet that she wished to know, but somehow the words choked her when\nshe wanted to ask further questions. Fortunately Mme. la Duchesse was\ntaking Maurice thoroughly to task. She asked innumerable questions, and\nwould not spare him the relation of a single detail.\n\n\"Tell us all about it from the beginning, Maurice,\" she said. \"Where did\nyou first meet the rogue?\"\n\nAnd Maurice--weary and ashamed--was forced to embark on a minute account\nof adventures that were lies from beginning to end: he had stumbled\nacross the wayside hostelry on a lonely by-path: he had found it full of\ncut-throats: he had stalked and waylaid their chief in his own room,\nand forced him to give up the money by the weight of his fists.\n\nIt was paltry and pitiable: nevertheless, St. Genis, as he warmed to his\ntale, lost the shame of it; only wrath remained with him: anger that he\nshould be forced into this despicable r\u00c3\u00b4le through the intrigues of a\nrival.\n\nIn his heart he was already beginning to find innumerable excuses for\nhis cowardice: and his rage and hatred grew against Clyffurde as\nMadame's more and more persistent questions taxed his imagination almost\nto exhaustion.\n\nWhen, after half an hour of this wearying cross-examination, Madame at\nlast granted him a respite, he made a pretext of urgent business at M.\nle Comte d'Artois' headquarters and took his leave of the ladies. He\nwaited in vain hope that the Duchesse's tact would induce her to leave\nhim alone for a moment with Crystal. Madame stuck obstinately to her\nchair and was blind and deaf to every hint of appeal from him, whilst\nCrystal, who was singularly absorbed and had lent but a very indifferent\near to his narrative, made no attempt to detain him.\n\nShe gave him her hand to kiss, just as Madame had done; it lay hot and\nmoist in his grasp.\n\n\"Crystal,\" he continued to murmur as his lips touched her fingers, \"I\nlove you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I worked for you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. it is not my fault that I failed.\"\n\nShe looked at him kindly and sympathetically through her tears, and gave\nhis hand a gentle little pressure.\n\n\"I am sure it was not your fault,\" she replied gently, \"poor Maurice.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nIt was not more than any kind friend would say under like circumstances,\nbut to a lover every little word from the beloved has a significance of\nits own, every look from her has its hidden meaning. Somewhat satisfied\nand cheered Maurice now took his final leave:\n\n\"Does M. le Comte propose to continue his journey to Paris?\" he asked at\nthe last.\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" Crystal replied, \"he could not stay away while he feels that\nHis Majesty may have need of him. Oh, Maurice!\" she added suddenly,\nforgetting her absorption, her wrath against Clyffurde, her own\ndisappointment--everything--in face of the awful possible calamity, and\nturning anxious, appealing eyes upon the young man, \"you don't think, do\nyou, that that abominable usurper will succeed in ousting the King once\nmore from his throne?\"\n\nAnd St. Genis--remembering Laffray and Grenoble, remembering what was\ngoing on in Lyons at this moment, the silent grumblings of the troops,\nthe defaced white cockades, the cries of \"Vive l'Empereur!\" which he\nhimself had heard as he rode through the town--St. Genis, remembering\nall this, could only shake his head and shrug his shoulders in miserable\ndoubt.\n\nWhen he had gone at last, Crystal's thoughts veered back once more to\nClyffurde and to his treachery.\n\n\"What abominable deceit, _ma tante_!\" she cried, and quite against her\nwill tears of wrath and of disappointment rose to her eyes. \"What\nvillainy! what odious, execrable treachery!\"\n\nMadame shrugged her shoulders and took up her knitting.\n\n\"These days, my dear,\" she said with unwonted placidity, \"the world is\nso full of treachery that men and women absorb it by every pore.\"\n\n\"But I shall not leave it at that,\" rejoined Crystal resolutely. \"I'll\nfind a means of punishing that vile traitor .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I'll make him feel the\nhatred which he has so richly deserved--I shall not rest till I have\nmade him suffer as he makes me suffer now. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"My dear--my dear--\" protested Mme. la Duchesse, not a little shocked at\nthe girl's vehemence.\n\nIndeed, Crystal's otherwise sweet, gentle, yielding personality seemed\ncompletely transformed: for the moment she was just a sensitive woman\nwho has been hit and hurt, and whose desire for retaliation is keener,\nmore relentless than that of a man. All the soft look in her blue eyes\nhad gone--they looked dark and hard--her fair curls were matted against\nher damp forehead; indeed, Madame thought that for the moment all\nCrystal's beauty had gone--the sweet, submissive beauty of the girl, the\ngrace of movement, the shy, appealing gentleness of her ways. She now\nlooked all determination, resentment, and, above all, revenge.\n\n\"The dear child,\" sighed the Duchesse over her knitting, \"it is the\nEnglish blood in her. Those people never know how to accept the\ninevitable: they are always wanting to fight someone for something and\nnever know when they are beaten.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE ASCENT OF THE CAPITOL\n\n\nI\n\nAnd the triumphal march from the gulf of Jouan continued uninterrupted\nto Paris.\n\nAfter Laffray and Grenoble, Lyons, where the silk-weavers of La\nGuilloti\u00c3\u00a8re assembled in their thousands to demolish the barricades\nwhich had been built up on their bridge against the arrival of the\nEmperor, and watched his entry into their city waving kerchiefs and hats\nin his honour, and tricolour flags and cockades fished out of cupboards,\nwhere they had lain hidden but not forgotten for one whole year.\n\nAfter Lyons, Villefranche, where sixty thousand peasants and workmen\nawaited his arrival at the foot of the tree of Liberty, on the top of\nwhich a brass eagle, the relic of some old standard, glistened like gold\nas it caught the rays of the setting sun.\n\nAnd Nevers, where the townsfolk urged the regiments as they march\nthrough the city to tear the white cockades from their hats! And\nChalon-sur-Sa\u00c3\u00b4ne, where the workpeople commandeer a convoy of artillery\ndestined for the army of M. le Comte d'Artois!\n\nThe pr\u00c3\u00a9fets of the various d\u00c3\u00a9partements, the bureaucracy of provinces\nand cities, are not only amazed but struck with terror:\n\n\"This is a new Revolution!\" they cry in dismay.\n\nYes! it is a new Revolution! the revolt of the peasantry of the poor,\nthe humble, the oppressed! The hatred which they felt against that old\nregime which had come back to them with its old arrogance and its former\ntyrannies had joined issue with the cult of the army for the Emperor who\nhad led it to glory, to fortune and to fame.\n\nThe people and the army were roused by the same enthusiasm, and marched\nshoulder to shoulder to join the standard of Napoleon--the little man in\nthe shabby hat and the grey redingote, who for them personified the\nspirit of the great revolution, the great struggle for liberty and its\nfinal victory.\n\nThe army of the Comte d'Artois--that portion of it which remained\nloyal--was powerless against the overwhelming tide of popular\nenthusiasm, powerless against dissatisfaction, mutterings and constant\ndefections in its ranks. The army would have done well in Provence--for\nProvence was loyal and royalist, man, woman and child: but Napoleon took\nthe route of the Alps, and avoided Provence; by the time he reached\nLyons he had an army of his own and M. le Comte d'Artois--fearing more\ndefections and worse defeats--had thought it prudent to retire.\n\nIt has often been said that if a single shot had been fired against his\noriginal little band Napoleon's march on Paris would have been stopped.\nWho shall tell? There are such \"ifs\" in the world, which no human mind\ncan challenge. Certain it is that that shot was not fired. At Laffray,\nRandon gave the order, but he did not raise his musket himself; on the\nwalls of Grenoble St. Genis, in command of the artillery and urged by\nthe Comte de Cambray, did not dare to give the order or to fire a gun\nhimself. \"The men declare,\" he had said gloomily, \"that they would blow\ntheir officers from their own guns.\"\n\nAnd at Lyons there was not militiaman, a royalist, volunteer or a pariah\nout of the streets who was willing to fire that first and \"single shot\":\nand though Marshal Macdonald swore ultimately that he would do it\nhimself, his determination failed him at the last when surrounded by his\nwavering troops he found himself face to face with the conqueror of\nAusterlitz and Jena and Rivoli and a thousand other glorious fights,\nwith the man in the grey redingote who had created him Marshal of France\nand Duke of Tarente on the battlefields of Lombardy, his comrade-in-arms\nwho had shared his own scanty army rations with him, slept beside him\nround the bivouac fires, and round whom now there rose a cry from end to\nend of Lyons: \"Vive l'Empereur!\"\n\n\nII\n\nVictor de Marmont did not wait for the arrival of the Emperor at Lyons:\nnor did he attempt to enter the city. He knew that there was still some\nmoney in the imperial treasury brought over from Elba, and his\nmind--always in search of the dramatic--had dwelt with pleasure on\nthoughts of the day when the Emperor, having entered Fontainebleau, or\nperhaps even Paris and the Tuileries, would there be met by his faithful\nde Marmont, who on bended knees in the midst of a brilliant and admiring\nthrong would present to him the twenty-five million francs originally\nthe property of the Empress herself and now happily wrested from the\ncupidity of royalist traitors.\n\nThe picture pleased de Marmont's fancy: he dwelt on it with delight, he\nknew that no one requited a service more amply and more generously than\nNapoleon: he knew that after this service rendered there was nothing to\nwhich he--de Marmont--young as he was, could not aspire--title, riches,\nhonours, anything he wanted would speedily become his, and with these to\nhis credit he could claim Crystal de Cambray once more.\n\nOh! she would be humbled again by then, she and her father too, the\nproud aristocrats, doomed once more to penury and exile, unless he--de\nMarmont--came forth like the fairy prince to the beggarmaid with hands\nladen with riches, ready to lay these at the feet of the woman he loved.\n\nYes! Crystal de Cambray would be humbled! De Marmont, though he felt\nthat he loved her more and better than any man had ever loved any woman\nbefore, nevertheless had a decided wish that she should be humbled and\nsuffer bitterly thereby. He felt that her pride was his only enemy: her\npride and royalist prejudices. Of the latter he thought but little:\nconfident of his Emperor's success, he thought that all those hot-headed\nroyalists would soon realise the hopelessness of their cause--rendered\nall the more hopeless through its short-lived triumph of the past\nyear--and abandon it gradually and surely, accepting the inevitable and\nrejoicing over the renewed glory which would come over France.\n\nAs for her pride! well! that was going to be humbled, along with the\npride of the Bourbon princes, of that fatuous old king, of all those\narrogant aristocrats who had come back after years of exile, as\narrogant, as tyrannical as ever before.\n\nThese were pleasing thoughts which kept Victor de Marmont company on his\nway between Lyons and Fontainebleau. Once past Villefranche he sent the\nbulk of his escort back to Lyons, where the Emperor should have arrived\nby this time: he had written out a superficial report of his expedition,\nwhich the sergeant in charge of the little troop was to convey to the\nEmperor's own hands. He only kept two men with him, put himself and them\ninto plain, travelling clothes which he purchased at Villefranche, and\ncontinued his journey to the north without much haste; the roads were\nsafe enough from footpads, he and his two men were well armed, and what\nstragglers from the main royalist army he came across would be far too\nbusy with their own retreat and their own disappointment to pay much\nheed to a civilian and seemingly harmless traveller.\n\nDe Marmont loved to linger on the way in the towns and hamlets where the\nnews of the Emperor's approach had already been wafted from Grenoble, or\nLyons, or Villefranche on the wings of wind or birds, who shall say?\nEnough that it had come, that the peasants, assembled in masses in their\nvillages, were whispering together that he was coming--the little man in\nthe grey redingote--l'Empereur!\n\nAnd de Marmont would halt in those villages and stop to whisper with the\npeasants too: Yes! he was coming! and the whole of France was giving him\na rousing welcome! There was Laffray and Grenoble and Lyons! the army\nrallied to his standard as one man!\n\nAnd de Marmont would then pass on to another village, to another town,\nno longer whispering after a while, but loudly proclaiming the arrival\nof the Emperor who had come into his own again.\n\nAfter Nevers he was only twenty-four hours ahead of Napoleon and his\nprogress became a triumphant one: newspapers, despatches had filtrated\nthrough from Paris--news became authentic, though some of it sounded a\nlittle wild. Wherever de Marmont arrived he was received with\nacclamations as the man who had seen the Emperor, who had assisted at\nthe Emperor's magnificent entry into Grenoble, who could assure citizens\nand peasantry that it was all true, that the Emperor would be in Paris\nagain very shortly and that once more there would be an end to tyranny\nand oppression, to the rule of the aristocrats and a number of\nincompetent and fatuous princes.\n\nHe did not halt at Fontainebleau, for now he knew that the Court of the\nTuileries was in a panic, that neither the Comte d'Artois, nor the Duc\nde Berry, nor any of the royal princes had succeeded in keeping the army\ntogether: that defections had been rife for the past week, even before\nNapoleon had shown himself, and that Marshal Ney, the bravest soldier\nin France, had joined his Emperor at Auxerre.\n\nNo! de Marmont would not halt at Fontainebleau. It was Paris that he\nwanted to see! Paris, which to-day would witness the hasty flight of the\ngouty and unpopular King whom it had never learned to love! Paris\ndecking herself out like a bride for the arrival of her bridegroom!\nParis waiting and watching, while once again on the Tuileries and the\nH\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville, on the Louvre and the Luxembourg, on church towers and\ngovernment buildings the old tricolour flag waved gaily in the wind.\n\nHe slept that night at a small hotel in the Louvre quarter, but the\nwhole evening he spent on the Place du Carrousel with the crowd outside\nthe Tuileries, watching the departure from the palace of the infirm King\nof France and of his Court. The crowd was silent and obviously deeply\nmoved. The spectacle before it of an old, ailing monarch, driven forth\nout of the home of his ancestors, and forced after an exile of three and\ntwenty years and a brief reign of less than one, to go back once more to\nmisery and exile, was pitiable in the extreme.\n\nMany forgot all that the brief reign had meant in disappointments and\nbitter regrets, and only saw in the pathetic figure that waddled\npainfully from portico to carriage door a monarch who was unhappy,\nabandoned and defenceless: a monarch, too, who, in his unheroic,\nsometimes grotesque person, was nevertheless the representative of all\nthe privileges and all the rights, of all the dignity and majesty\npertaining to the most ancient ruling dynasty in Europe, as well as of\nall the humiliations and misfortunes which that same dynasty had\nendured.\n\n\nIII\n\nIt is late in the evening of March 20th. A thin mist is spreading from\nthe river right over Paris, and from the Place du Carrousel the lighted\nwindows of the Tuileries palace appear only like tiny, dimly-flickering\nstars.\n\nHere an immense crowd is assembled. It has waited patiently hour after\nhour, ever since in the earlier part of the afternoon a courier has come\nover from Fontainebleau with the news that the Emperor is already there\nand would be in Paris this night.\n\nIt is the same crowd which twenty-four hours ago shed a tear or two in\nsympathy for the departing monarch: now it stands here--waiting,\nexcited, ready to cheer the return of a popular hero--half-forgotten,\nwildly acclaimed, madly welcomed, to be cursed again, and again\nforgotten so soon. It was a heterogeneous crowd forsooth! made up in\ngreat part of the curious, the idle, the indifferent, and in great part,\ntoo, of the Bonapartist enthusiasts and malcontents who had groaned\nunder the reactionary tyranny of the Restoration--of malcontents, too,\nof no enthusiasm, who were ready to welcome any change which might bring\nthem to prominence or to fortune. With here and there a sprinkling of\nhot-headed revolutionaries, cursing the return of the Emperor as\nheartily as they had cursed that of the Bourbon king: and here and there\na few heart-sick royalists, come to watch the final annihilation of\ntheir hopes.\n\nVictor de Marmont, wrapped in a dark cloak, stood among the crowd for a\nwhile. He knew that the Emperor would probably not be in Paris before\nnight, and he loved to be in the very midst of the wave of enthusiasm\nwhich was surging higher and ever higher in the crowd, and hear the\nexcited whispers, and to feel all round him, wrapping him closely like a\nmagic mantle of warmth and delight, the exaltation of this mass of men\nand women assembled here to acclaim the hero whom he himself adored.\nClosely buttoned inside his coat he had scraps of paper worth the ransom\nof any king.\n\nAmong the crowd, too, Bobby Clyffurde moved and stood. He was one of\nthose who watched this enthusiasm with a heart filled with forebodings.\nHe knew well how short this enthusiasm would be: he knew that within a\nfew weeks--days perhaps--the bold and reckless adventurer who had so\neasily reconquered France would realise that the Imperial crown would\nnever be allowed to sit firmly upon his head. None in this crowd knew\nbetter that the present pageant and glory would be short-lived, than did\nthis tall, quiet Englishman who listened with half an ear and a smile of\ngood-natured contempt to the loud cries of \"Vive l'Empereur!\" which rose\nspontaneously whenever the sound of horses' hoofs or rattles of wheels\nfrom the direction of Fontainebleau suggested the approach of the hero\nof the day. None knew better than he that already in far-off England\nanother great hero, named Wellington, was organising the forces which\npresently would crush--for ever this time--the might and ambitions of\nthe man whom England had never acknowledged as anything but a usurper\nand a foe.\n\nAnd closely buttoned inside his coat Clyffurde had a letter which he had\nreceived at his lodgings in the Alma quarter only a few moments before\nhe sallied forth into the streets. That letter was an answer to a\nconfidential enquiry of his own sent to the Chief of the British Secret\nIntelligence Department resident in Paris, desiring to know if the\nDepartment had any knowledge of a vast sum of money having come\nunexpectedly into the hands of His Majesty the King of France, before\nhis flight from the capital.\n\nThe answer was an emphatic \"No!\" The Intelligence Department knew of no\nsuch windfall. But its secret agents reported that Victor de Marmont,\ncaptain of the usurper's body-guard, had waylaid M. le Marquis de St.\nGenis on the high road not far from Lyons. The escort which had\naccompanied Victor de Marmont on that occasion had been dismissed by him\nat Villefranche, and the information which the British Secret\nIntelligence Department had obtained came through the indiscretion of\nthe sergeant in charge of the escort, who had boasted in a tavern at\nLyons that he had actually searched M. de St. Genis and found a large\nsum of money upon him, of which M. de Marmont promptly took possession.\n\nWhen Bobby Clyffurde received this letter and first mastered its\ncontents, the language which he used would have done honour to a Toulon\ncoal-heaver. He cursed St. Genis' stupidity in allowing himself to be\ncaught; but above all he cursed himself for his soft-heartedness which\nhad prompted him to part with the money.\n\nThe letter which brought him the bad news seemed to scorch his hand, and\nbrand it with the mark of folly. He had thought to serve the woman he\nloved, first, by taking the money from her, since he knew that Victor de\nMarmont with an escort of cavalry was after it, and, secondly, by\nallowing the man whom she loved to have the honour and glory of laying\nthe money at his sovereign's feet. The whole had ended in a miserable\nfiasco, and Clyffurde felt sore and wrathful against himself.\n\nAnd also among the crowd--among those who came, heartsick, hopeless,\nforlorn, to watch the triumph of the enemy as they had watched the\nhumiliation of their feeble King--was M. le Comte de Cambray with his\ndaughter Crystal on his arm.\n\nThey had come, as so many royalists had done, with a vague hope that in\nthe attitude of the crowd they would discern indifference rather than\nexultation, and that the active agents of their party, as well as those\nof England and of Prussia, would succeed presently in stirring up a\ncounter demonstration, that a few cries of \"Vive le roi!\" would prove to\nthe army at least and to the people of Paris that acclamations for the\nusurper were at any rate not unanimous.\n\nBut the crowd was not indifferent--it was excited: when first the Comte\nde Cambray and Crystal arrived on the Place du Carrousel, a number of\nwhite cockades could be picked out in the throng, either worn on a hat\nor fixed to a buttonhole, but as the afternoon wore on there were fewer\nand fewer of these small white stars to be seen: the temper of the crowd\ndid not brook this mute reproach upon its enthusiasm. One or two\ncockades had been roughly torn and thrown into the mud, and the wearer\nunpleasantly ill-used if he persisted in any royalistic demonstration.\nCrystal, when she saw these incidents, was not the least frightened. She\nwore her white cockade openly pinned to her cloak; she was far too\nloyal, far too enthusiastic and fearless, far too much a woman to yield\nher convictions to the popular feeling of the moment; and she looked so\nyoung and so pretty, clinging to the arm of her father, who looked a\npicturesque and harmless representative of the fallen regime, that with\nthe exception of a few rough words, a threat here and there, they had so\nfar escaped active molestation.\n\nAnd the crowd presently had so much to see that it ceased to look out\nfor white cockades, or to bait the sad-eyed royalists. A procession of\ncarriages, sparse at first and simple in appearance, had begun to make\nits way from different parts of the town across the Place du Carrousel\ntoward the Tuileries. They arrived very quietly at first, with as little\nclatter as possible, and drew up before the gates of the Pavillon de\nFlore with as little show as may be: the carriage doors were opened\nunostentatiously, and dark, furtive figures stepped out from them and\nalmost ran to the door of the palace, so eager were they to escape\nobservation, their big cloaks wrapped closely round them to hide the\ncourt dress or uniform below.\n\nMinisters, dignitaries of the Court, Councillors of State; majordomos,\nstewards, butlers, body-servants; they all came one by one or in groups\nof twos or threes. As the afternoon wore on these arrivals grew less and\nless furtive; the carriages arrived with greater clatter and to-do, with\nfiner liveries and more gorgeous harness. Those who stepped out of the\ncarriage doors were no longer quick and stealthy in their movements:\nthey lingered near the step to give an order or to chat to a friend; the\nbig cloak no longer concealed the gorgeous uniform below, it was allowed\nto fall away from the shoulder, so as to display the row of medals and\nstars, the gold embroidery, the magnificence of the Court attire.\n\nThe Emperor had left Fontainebleau! Within an hour he would be in Paris!\nEveryone knew it, and the excitement in the crowd that watched grew more\nand more intense. Last night these same men and women had looked with\nmute if superficial sympathy on the departure of Louis XVIII. through\nthese same palace gates: many eyes then became moist at the sight, as\nmemory flew back twenty years to the murdered king--his flight to\nVarennes, his ignominious return, his weary Calvary from prison to court\nhouse and thence to the scaffold. And here was his brother--come back\nafter twenty-three years of exile, acclaimed by the populace, cheered by\nforeign soldiers--Russians, Austrians, English--anything but French--and\ndriven forth once more to exile after the brief glory that lasted not\nquite a year.\n\nBut this the crowd of to-day has already forgotten with the completeness\npeculiar to crowds: men, women, and children too, they are no longer\nmute, they talk and they chatter; they scream with astonishment and\ndelight whenever now from more and more carriages, more and more\ngorgeously dressed folk descend. The ladies are beginning to arrive: the\nwives of the great Court dignitaries, the ladies of the Court and\nhousehold of the still-absent Empress: they do not attempt to hide their\nbrilliant toilettes, their bare shoulders and arms gleam through the\nfastenings of their cloaks, and diamonds sparkle in their hair.\n\nThe crowd has recognised some of the great marshals, the men who in the\nEmperor's wake led the French troops to victory in Italy, in Prussia, in\nAustria: Maret Duc de Bassano is there and the crowd cheers him, the Duc\nde Rovigo, Marshal Davout, Prince d'Eckm\u00c3\u00bchl, General Excelmans, one of\nNapoleon's oldest companions at arms, the Duke of Gaeta, the Duke of\nPadua, a crowd of generals and superior officers. It seems like the\nworld of the Sleeping Beauty and of the Enchanted Castle--which a kiss\nhas awakened from its eleven months' sleep. The Empire had only been\nasleep, it had dreamed a bad dream, wherein its hero was a prisoner and\nan exile: now it is slowly wakening back to life and to reality.\n\nThe night wears on: darkness and fog envelop Paris more and more.\nExcitement becomes akin to anxiety. If the Emperor did leave\nFontainebleau when the last courier said that he did, he should\ncertainly be here by now. There are strange whispers, strange waves of\nevil reports that spread through the waiting crowd: \"A royalist fanatic\nhad shot at the Emperor! the Emperor was wounded! he was dead!\"\n\nOh! the excitement of that interminable wait!\n\nAt last, just as from every church tower the bells strike the hour of\nnine, there comes the muffled sound of a distant cavalcade: the sound of\nhorses galloping and only half drowning that of the rumbling of coach\nwheels.\n\nIt comes from the direction of the embankment, and from far away now is\nheard the first cry of \"Vive l'Empereur!\" The noise gets louder and more\nclear, the cries are repeated again and again till they merge into one\ngreat, uproarious clamour. Like the ocean when lashed by the wind, the\ncrowd surges, moves, rises on tiptoe, subsides, falls back to crush\nforward again and once more to retreat as a heavy coach, surrounded by\na thousand or so of mounted men, dashes over the cobbles of the Place du\nCarrousel, whilst the clamour of the crowd becomes positively deafening.\n\n\"Vive l'Empereur!\"\n\nThe officers in the courtyard of the palace rush to the coach as it\ndraws up at the Pavillon de Flore: one of them succeeds in opening the\ncarriage door. The Emperor is literally torn out of the carriage,\ncarried to the vestibule, where more officers seize him, raise him from\nthe crowd, bear him along, hoisted upon their shoulders, up the\nmonumental staircase.\n\nTheir enthusiasm is akin to delirium: they nearly tear their hero to\npieces in their wild, mad, frantic welcome.\n\n\"In Heaven's name, protect his person,\" exclaims the Duc de Vicence\nanxiously; and he and Lavalette manage to get hold of the banisters and\nby dint of fighting and pushing succeed in walking backwards step by\nstep in front of the Emperor, thus making a way for him.\n\nLavalette can hardly believe his eyes, and the Duc de Vicence keeps\nmurmuring: \"It is the Emperor! It is the Emperor!\"\n\nAnd he--the little stout man in green cloth coat and white\nbreeches--walks up the steps of his reconquered palace like a man in a\ndream: his eyes are fixed apparently on nothing, he makes no movement to\nkeep his too enthusiastic friends away: the smile upon his lips is\nmeaningless and fixed.\n\n\"Vive l'Empereur!\" vociferates the crowd.\n\nVive l'Empereur for one hundred days: a few weeks of joy, a few weeks of\nanxiety, a few weeks of indecision, of wavering and of doubt. Then\ndefeat more irrevocable than before! exile more distant! despair more\ncomplete.\n\nVive l'Empereur while we shout with excitement, while we remember the\ndisappointments of the past year, while we hope for better things from\na hand that has lost its cunning, a mind that has lost its power.\n\nVive l'Empereur! Let him live for an hundred days, while we forget our\nenthusiasm and Europe prepares its final crushing blow. Let him live\nuntil we remember once again the horrors of war, the misery, the famine,\nthe devastated homes! until once more we see the maimed and crippled\ncrawling back wearily from the fields of glory, until our ears ring with\nthe wails of widows and the cries of the fatherless.\n\nThen let him no longer live, for he it is who has brought this misery on\nus through his will and through his ambition, and France has suffered so\nmuch from the aftermath of glory, that all she wants now is rest.\n\n\nIV\n\nGradually--but it took some hours--the tumult and excitement in and\nround the Tuileries subsided. The Emperor managed to shut himself up in\nhis study and to eat some supper in peace, while gradually outside his\nwindows the crowd--who had nothing more to see and was getting tired of\nstaring up at glittering panes of glass--went back more or less quietly\nto their homes.\n\nOnly in the courtyard of the Tuileries, the troopers of the cavalry\nwhich had formed the Emperor's escort from Fontainebleau tethered their\nhorses to the railings, rolled themselves in their mantles and slept on\nthe pavements, giving to this portion of the palace the appearance of a\nbivouac in a place which has been taken by storm.\n\nOne of the last to leave the Place du Carrousel was Bobby Clyffurde. The\ncrowd was thin by this time, but it was the tired and the\nindifferent--the merely curious--who had been the first to go. Those who\nremained to the last were either the very enthusiastic who wanted to set\nup a final shout of \"Vive l'Empereur!\" after their idol had entirely\ndisappeared from their view, or the malcontents who would not lose a\nmoment to discuss their grievances, to murmur covert threats, or suggest\nrevolt in some shape or form or kind.\n\nBobby slipped quickly past several of these isolated groups, indifferent\nto the dark and glowering looks of suspicion that were cast at his tall,\nmuscular figure with the firm step and the defiant walk that was vaguely\nreminiscent of the British troops that had been in Paris last year at\nthe time of the foreign occupation. He had skirted the Tuileries gardens\nand was walking along the embankment which now was dark and solitary\nsave for some rowdy enthusiasts on ahead who, arm in arm in two long\nrows that reached from the garden railings to the parapet, were\nobstructing the roadway and shouting themselves hoarse with \"Vive\nl'Empereur!\"\n\nClyffurde, who was walking faster than they did, was just deliberating\nin his mind whether he would turn back and go home some other way or\ncharge this unpleasant obstruction from the rear and risk the\nconsequences, when he noticed two figures still further on ahead walking\nin the same direction as he himself and the rowdy crowd.\n\nOne of these two figures--thus viewed in the distance, through the mist\nand from the back--looked nevertheless like that of a woman, which fact\nat once decided Bobby as to what he would do next. He sprinted toward\nthe crowd as fast as he could, but unfortunately he did not come up with\nthem in time to prevent the two unfortunate pedestrians being surrounded\nby the turbulent throng which, still arm in arm and to the accompaniment\nof wild shouts, had formed a ring around them and were now vociferating\nat the top of raucous voices:\n\n\"\u00c3\u0080 bas la cocarde blanche! \u00c3\u0080 bas! Vive l'Empereur!\"\n\nA flickering street lamp feebly lit up this unpleasant scene. Bobby saw\nthe vague outline of a man and of a woman, standing boldly in the midst\nof the hostile crowd while two white cockades gleamed defiantly against\nthe dark background of their cloaks. To an Englishman, who was a\npastmaster in the noble art of using fists and knees to advantage, the\nsituation was neither uncommon nor very perilous. The crowd was noisy it\nis true, and was no doubt ready enough for mischief, but Clyffurde's\nswift and scientific onslaught from the rear staggered and disconcerted\nthe most bold. There was a good deal more shouting, plenty of cursing;\nthe Englishman's arms and legs seemed to be flying in every direction\nlike the arms of a windmill; a good many thuds and bumps, a few groans,\na renewal of the attack, more thuds and groans, and the discomfited\ngroup of roisterers fled in every direction.\n\nBobby with a smile turned to the two motionless figures whom he had so\nopportunely rescued from an unpleasant plight.\n\n\"Just a few turbulent blackguards,\" he said lightly, as he made a quick\nattempt at readjusting the set of his coat and the position of his satin\nstock. \"There was not much fight in them really, and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHe had, of course, lost his hat in the brief if somewhat stormy\nencounter and now--as he turned--the thin streak of light from the\nstreet-lamp fell full upon his face with its twinkling, deep-set eyes,\nand the half-humorous, self-deprecatory curl of the firm mouth.\n\nA simultaneous exclamation came from his two prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9s and stopped the\neasy flow of his light-hearted words. He peered closely into the gloom\nand it was his turn now to exclaim, half doubting, wholly astonished:\n\n\"Mademoiselle Crystal .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. M. le Comte. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Sir,\" broke in the Comte slowly, and with a voice that seemed\nto be trembling with emotion, \"it is to my daughter and to myself that\nyou have just rendered a signal and generous service. For this I tender\nyou my thanks, yet believe me, I pray you when I say that both she and\nI would rather have suffered any humiliation or ill-usage from that\nrough crowd than owe our safety and comfort to you.\"\n\nThere was so much contempt, hatred even, in the tone of voice of this\nold man whose manner habitually was a pattern of moderation and of\ndignity that for the moment Clyffurde was completely taken aback.\nPuzzlement fought with resentment and with the maddening sense that he\nwas anyhow impotent to avenge even so bitter an insult as had just been\nhurled upon him--against a man of the Comte's years and status.\n\n\"M. le Comte,\" he said at last, \"will you let me remind you that the\nother day when you turned me out of your house like a dishonest servant,\nyou would not allow me to say a single word in my own justification? The\nman on whose word you condemned me then without a hearing, is a\nscatter-brained braggart who you yourself must know is not a man to be\ntrusted and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, Monsieur,\" broke in the Comte with perfect sangfroid, \"even\nif I acted on that evening with undue haste and ill-considered judgment,\nmany things have happened since which you yourself surely would not wish\nto discuss with me, just when you have rendered me a signal service.\"\n\n\"Your pardon, M. le Comte,\" retorted Clyffurde with equal coolness, \"I\nknow of nothing which could possibly justify the charges which, not\nlater than last Sunday, you laid at my door.\"\n\n\"The charge which I laid at your door then, Mr. Clyffurde, has not been\nlifted from its threshold yet. I charged you with deliberately\nconspiring against my King and my country all the while that you were\neating bread and salt at my table. I charged you with striving to render\nassistance to that Corsican usurper whom may the great God punish, and\nyou yourself practically owned to this before you left my house.\"\n\n\"This I did not, M. le Comte,\" broke in Clyffurde hotly. \"As a man of\nhonour I give you my word, that except for my being in de Marmont's\ncompany on the day that he posted up the Emperor's proclamation in\nGrenoble, I had no hand in any political scheme.\"\n\n\"And you would have me believe you,\" exclaimed the Comte, with\never-growing vehemence, \"when you talk of that Corsican brigand as 'the\nEmperor.' Those words, Sir, are an insult, and had you not saved my\ndaughter and me just now from violence I would--old as I am--strike you\nin the face for them.\"\n\nWith an impatient sigh at the old man's hot-headed obstinacy, Clyffurde\nturned with a look of appeal to Crystal, who up to now had taken no part\nin the discussion: \"Mademoiselle,\" he said gently, \"will you not at\nleast do me justice? Cannot you see that I am clumsy at defending mine\nown honour, seeing that I have never had to do it before?\"\n\n\"I only see, Monsieur,\" she retorted coldly, \"that you are making vain\nand pitiable efforts to regain my father's regard--no doubt for purposes\nof your own. But why should you trouble? You have nothing more to gain\nfrom us. Your clever comedy of a highwayman on the road has succeeded\nbeyond your expectations. The Corsican who now sits in the armchair\nlately vacated by an infirm monarch whom you and yours helped to\ndethrone, will no doubt reward you for your pains. As for me I can only\necho my father's feelings: I would ten thousand times sooner have been\ntorn to pieces by a rough crowd of ignorant folk than owe my safety to\nyour interference.\"\n\nShe took her father's arm and made a movement to go: instinctively\nClyffurde tried to stop her: at her words he had flushed with anger to\nthe very roots of his hair. The injustice of her accusation maddened\nhim, but the bitter resentment in the tone of her voice, the look of\npassionate hatred with which she regarded him as she spoke, positively\nappalled him.\n\n\"M. le Comte,\" he said firmly, \"I cannot let you go like this, whilst\nsuch horrible thoughts of me exist in your mind. England gave you\nshelter for three and twenty years; in the name of my country's kindness\nand hospitality toward you, I--as one of her sons--demand that you tell\nme frankly and clearly exactly what I am supposed to have done to\njustify this extraordinary hatred and contempt which you and\nMademoiselle Crystal seem now to have for me.\"\n\n\"One of England's sons, Monsieur!\" retorted the Comte equally firmly.\n\"Nay! you are not even that. England stands for right and for justice,\nfor our legitimate King and the punishment of the usurper.\"\n\n\"Great God!\" he exclaimed, more and more bewildered now, \"are you\naccusing me of treachery against mine own country? This will I allow no\nman to do, not even .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Then, Sir, I pray you,\" rejoined Crystal proudly, \"go and seek a\nquarrel with the man who has unmasked you; who caught you red-handed\nwith the money in your possession which you had stolen from us, who\nforced you to give up what you had stolen, and whom then you and your\nfriend Victor de Marmont waylaid and robbed once more. Go then, Mr.\nClyffurde, and seek a quarrel with the Marquis de St. Genis, who has\nalready struck you in the face once and no doubt will be ready to do so\nagain.\"\n\nAnd what of Clyffurde's thoughts while the woman whom he loved with all\nthe strength of his lonely heart poured forth these hideous insults upon\nhim? Amazement, then wrath, bewilderment, then final hopelessness, all\nthese sensations ran riot through his brain.\n\nSt. Genis had behaved like an abominable blackguard! this he gathered\nfrom what she said: he had lied like a mean skunk and betrayed the man\nwho had rendered him an infinitely great service. Of him Clyffurde\nwouldn't even think! Such despicable, crawling worms did exist on God's\nearth: he knew that! but he possessed the happy faculty, the sunny\ndisposition that is able to pass a worm by and ignore its existence\nwhile keeping his eyes fixed upon all that is beautiful in earth and in\nthe sky. Of St. Genis, therefore, he would not think; some day, perhaps,\nhe might be able to punish him--but not now--not while this poor,\nforlorn, heartsick girl pinned her implicit faith upon that wretched\nworm and bestowed on him the priceless guerdon of her love. An infinity\nof pity rose in his kindly heart for her and obscured every other\nemotion. That same pity he had felt for her before, a sweet, protecting\npity--gentle sister to fiercer, madder love which had perhaps never been\nso strong as it was at this hour when, for the second time, he was about\nto make a supreme sacrifice for her.\n\nThat the sacrifice must be made, he already knew: knew it even when\nfirst St. Genis' name escaped her lips. She loved St. Genis and she\nbelieved in him, and he, Clyffurde, who loved her with every fibre of\nhis being, with all the passionate ardour of his lonely heart, could\nserve her no better than by accepting this awful humiliation which she\nput upon him. If he could have justified himself now, he would not have\ndone it, not while she loved St. Genis, and he--Clyffurde--was less than\nnothing to her.\n\nWhat did it matter after all what she thought of him? He would have\ngiven his life for her love, but short of that everything else was\nanyhow intolerable--her contempt, her hatred? what mattered? since\nto-night anyhow he would pass out of her life for ever.\n\nHe was ready for the sacrifice--sacrifice of pride, of honour, of peace\nof mind--but he did want to know that that sacrifice would be really\nneeded and that when made it would not be in vain: and in order to gain\nthis end he put a final question to her:\n\n\"One moment, Mademoiselle,\" he said, \"before you go will you tell me one\nthing at least; was it M. de St. Genis himself who accused me of\ntreachery?\"\n\n\"There is no reason why I should deny it, Sir,\" she replied coldly. \"It\nwas M. de St. Genis himself who gave to my father and to me a full\naccount of the interview which he had with you at a lonely inn, some few\nkilom\u00c3\u00a8tres from Lyons, and less than two hours after we had been\nshamefully robbed on the highroad of money that belonged to the King.\"\n\n\"And did M. de St. Genis tell you, Mademoiselle, that I purposed to use\nthat money for mine own ends?\"\n\n\"Or for those of the Corsican,\" she retorted impatiently. \"I care not\nwhich. Yes! Sir, M. de St. Genis told me that with his own lips and when\nI had heard the whole miserable story of your duplicity and your\ntreachery, I--a helpless, deceived and feeble woman--did then and there\nregister a vow that I too would do you some grievous wrong one day--a\nwrong as great as you had done not only to the King of France but to me\nand to my father who trusted you as we would a friend. What you did\nto-night has of course altered the irrevocableness of my vow. I owe,\nperhaps, my father's life to your timely intervention and for this I\nmust be grateful, but .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHer voice broke in a kind of passionate sob, and it took her a moment or\ntwo to recover herself, even while Clyffurde stood by, mute and with\nwell-nigh broken heart, his very soul so filled with sorrow for her that\nthere was no room in it even for resentment.\n\n\"Father let us go now,\" Crystal said after a while with brusque\ntransition and in a steady voice; \"no purpose can be served by further\nrecriminations.\"\n\n\"None, my dear,\" said the Comte in his usual polished manner.\n\"Personally I have felt all along that explanations could but aggravate\nthe unpleasantness of the present position. Mr. Clyffurde understands\nperfectly, I am sure. He had his axe to grind--whether personal or\npolitical we really do not care to know--we are not likely ever to meet\nagain. All we can do now is to thank him for his timely intervention on\nour behalf and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"And brand him a liar,\" broke in Clyffurde almost involuntarily and with\nbitter vehemence.\n\n\"Your pardon, Monsieur,\" retorted the Comte coldly, \"neither my daughter\nnor I have done that. It is your deeds that condemn you, your own\nadmissions and the word of M. de St. Genis. Would you perchance suggest\nthat he lied?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" rejoined Clyffurde with perfect calm, \"it is I who lied, of\ncourse.\"\n\nHe had said this very slowly and as if speaking with mature\ndeliberation: not raising his voice, nor yet allowing it to quiver from\nany stress of latent emotion. And yet there was something in the tone of\nit, something in the man's attitude, that suggested such a depth of\npassion that, quite instinctively, the Comte remained silent and awed.\nFor the moment, however, Clyffurde seemed to have forgotten the older\nman's presence; wounded in every fibre of his being by the woman whom he\nloved so tenderly and so devotedly, he had spoken only to her,\ncompelling her attention and stirring--even by this simple admission of\na despicable crime--an emotion in her which she could not--would not\ndefine.\n\nShe turned large inquiring eyes on him, into which she tried to throw\nall that she felt of hatred and contempt for him. She had meant to wound\nhim and it seemed indeed as if she had succeeded beyond her dearest\nwish. By the dim, flickering light of the street-lamp his face looked\nhaggard and old. The traitor was suffering almost as much as he\ndeserved, almost as much--Crystal said obstinately to herself--as she\nhad wished him to do. And yet, at sight of him now, Crystal felt a\nstrong, unconquerable pity for him: the womanly instinct no doubt to\nheal rather than to hurt.\n\nBut this pity she was not prepared to show him: she wanted to pass right\nout of his life, to forget once and for all that sense of warmth of the\nsoul, of comfort and of peace which she had felt in his presence on that\nmemorable evening at Brestalou. Above all, she never wanted to touch his\nhand again, the hand which seemed to have such power to protect and to\nshield her, when on that same evening she had placed her own in it.\n\nTherefore, now she took her father's arm once more: she turned\nresolutely to go. One more curt nod of the head, one last look of\nundying enmity, and then she would pass finally out of his life for\never.\n\n\nV\n\nHow Clyffurde got back to his lodgings that night he never knew.\nCrystal, after his final admission, had turned without another word from\nhim, and he had stood there in the lonely, silent street watching her\nretreating form--on her father's arm--until the mist and gloom swallowed\nher up as in an elvish grave. Then mechanically he hunted for his hat\nand he, too, walked away.\n\nThat was the end of his life's romance, of course. The woman whom he\nloved with his very soul, who held his heart, his mind, his imagination\ncaptive, whose every look on him was joy, whose every smile was a\ndelight, had gone out of his life for ever! She had turned away from him\nas she would from a venomous snake! she hated him so cruelly that she\nwould gladly hurt him--do him some grievous wrong if she could. And\nClyffurde was left in utter loneliness with only a vague, foolish\nlonging in his heart--the longing that one day she might have her wish,\nand might have the power to wound him to death--bodily just as she had\nwounded him to the depth of his soul to-night.\n\nFor the rest there was nothing more for him to do in France. King Louis\nwas not like to remain at Lille very long: within twenty-four hours\nprobably he would continue his journey--his flight--to Ghent--where once\nmore he would hold his court in exile, with all the fugitive royalists\nrallied around his tottering throne.\n\nClyffurde had already received orders from his chief at the Intelligence\nDepartment to report himself first at Lille, then--if the King and court\nhad already left--at Ghent. If, however, there were plenty of men to do\nthe work of the Department it was his intention to give up his share in\nit and to cross over to England as soon as possible, so as to take up\nthe first commission in the new army that he could get. England would be\nwanting soldiers more urgently than she had ever done before: mother and\nsisters would be well looked after: he--Bobby--had earned a fortune for\nthem, and they no longer needed a bread-winner now: whilst England\nwanted all her sons, for she would surely fight.\n\nClyffurde, who had seen the English papers that morning--as they were\nbrought over by an Intelligence courier--had realised that the debates\nin Parliament could only end one way.\n\nEngland would not tolerate Bonaparte; she would not even tolerate his\nabdication in favour of his own son. Austria had already declared her\nintention of renewing the conflict and so had Prussia. England's\ndecision would, of course, turn the scale, and Bobby in his own mind had\nno doubt which way that decision would go.\n\nThe man whom the people of France loved, and whom his army idolised, was\nthe disturber of the peace of Europe. No one would believe his\nprotestations of pacific intentions now: he had caused too much\ndevastation, too much misery in the past--who would believe in him for\nthe future?\n\nFor the sake of that past, and for dread of the future, he must go--go\nfrom whence he could not again return, and Bobby Clyffurde--remembering\nGrenoble, remembering Lyons, Villefranche and Nevers--could not\naltogether suppress a sigh of regret for the brave man, the fine genius,\nthe reckless adventurer who had so boldly scaled for the second time the\nheights of the Capitol, oblivious of the fact that the Tarpeian Rock was\nso dangerously near.\n\n\nVI\n\nAt this same hour when Bobby Clyffurde finally bade adieu to all the\nvague hopes of happiness which his love for Crystal de Cambray had\nengendered in his heart, his whilom companion in the long ago--rival and\nenemy now--Victor de Marmont, was laying a tribute of twenty-five\nmillion francs at the feet of his beloved Emperor, and receiving the\nthanks of the man to serve whom he would gladly have given his life.\n\n\"What reward shall we give you for this service?\" the Emperor had\ndeigned to ask.\n\n\"The means to subdue a woman's pride, Sire, and make her thankful to\nmarry me,\" replied de Marmont promptly.\n\n\"A title, what?\" queried the Emperor. \"You have everything else, you\nrogue, to please a woman's fancy and make her thankful to marry you.\"\n\n\"A title, Sire, would be a welcome addition,\" said de Marmont lightly,\n\"and the freedom to go and woo her, until France and my Emperor need me\nagain.\"\n\n\"Then go and do your wooing, man, and come back here to me in three\nmonths, for I doubt not by then the flames of war will have been kindled\nagainst me again.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE SOUND OF REVELRY BY NIGHT\n\n\nI\n\nBut the hand had lost its cunning, the mighty brain its indomitable\nwill-power. Genius was still there, but it was cramped now by\nindecision--the indecision born of a sense of enmity around, suspicion\nwhere there should have been nothing but enthusiasm, and the blind\ndevotion of the past.\n\nThe man who, all alone, by the force of his personality and of his\nprestige had reconquered France, who had been acclaimed from the Gulf of\nJouan to the gates of the Tuileries as the saviour of France, the\npeople's Emperor, the beloved of the nation returned from exile, the man\nwho on the 20th of March had said with his old vigour and his old pride:\n\"Failure is the nightmare of the feeble! impotence, the refuge of the\npoltroon!\" the man who had marched as in a dream from end to end of\nFrance to find himself face to face with the whole of Europe in league\nagainst him, with a million men being hastily armed to hurl him from his\nthrone again, now found the south of France in open revolt, the west\nready to rise against him, the north in accord with his enemies.\n\nHe has not enough men to oppose to those millions, his arsenals are\ndepleted, his treasury empty. And after he has worked sixteen hours out\nof the twenty-four at reorganising his army, his finances, his machinery\nof war, he has to meet a set of apathetic or openly hostile ministers,\nconstitutional representatives, men who are ready to thwart him at every\nturn, jealous only of curtailing his power, of obscuring his ascendency,\nof clipping the eagle's wings, ere it soars to giddy heights again. And\nto them he must give in, from them he must beg, entreat: give up, give\nup all the time one hoped-for privilege after another, one power after\nanother.\n\nHe yields the military dictatorship to other--far less competent--hands;\nhe grants liberty to the press, liberty of debate, liberty of election,\nliberty to all and sundry: but suspicion lurks around him; they suspect\nhis sincerity, his goodwill, they doubt his promises, they mistrust that\ndormant Olympian ambition which has precipitated France into humiliation\nand brought the strangers' armies within her gates.\n\nThe same man was there--the same genius who even now could have mastered\nall the enemies of France and saved her from her present subjection and\nEuropean insignificance, but the men round him were not the same. He,\nthe guiding hand, was still there, but the machinery no longer worked as\nit had done in the past before disaster had blunted and stiffened the\ntemper of its steel.\n\nThe men around the Emperor were not now as they were in the days of Jena\nand Austerlitz and Wagram. Their characters and temperaments had\nundergone a change. Disaster had brought on slackness, the past year of\nconstant failures had engendered a sense of discouragement and\ndemoralisation, a desire to argue, to foresee difficulties, to foretell\nfurther disasters.\n\nHe saw it all well enough--he the man with the far-seeing mind and the\neagle-eyes that missed nothing--neither a look of indecision, nor an\nindication of revolt. He saw it all but he could do nothing, for he too\nfelt overwhelmed by that wave of indecision and of discouragement. Faith\nin himself, energy in action, had gone. He envisaged the possibility of\na vanquished and dismembered France.\n\nAbove all he had lost belief in his Star: the star of his destiny which,\nrising over the small island of Corsica, shining above a humble\nmiddle-class home, had guided him step by step, from triumph to triumph,\nto the highest pinnacle of glory to which man's ambition has ever\nreached.\n\nThat star had been dimmed once, its radiance was no longer unquenchable:\n\"Destiny has turned against me,\" he said, \"and in her I have lost my\nmost valuable helpmate.\"\n\nAnd now the whole of Europe had declared war against him, and in a final\nimpassioned speech he turns to his ministers and to the representatives\nof his people: \"Help me to save France!\" he begs, \"afterwards we'll\nsettle our quarrels.\"\n\nOne hundred days after he began his dream-march, from the gulf of Jouan\nin the wake of his eagle, he started from Paris with the Army which he\nloved and which alone he trusted, to meet Europe and his fate on the\nplains of Belgium.\n\n\nII\n\nAnd in Brussels they danced, danced late into the night. No one was to\nknow that within the next three days the destinies of the whole world\nwould be changed by the hand of God.\n\nAnd how to hide from timid eyes the sense of this oncoming destiny? how\nto stop for a few brief hours the flow of women's tears?\n\nThe ball should have been postponed--Her Grace of Richmond was willing\nthat it should be so. How could men and women dance, flirt and make\nmerry while Death was already reckoning the heavy toll of brave young\nlives which she would demand on the morrow? But who knows England who\nhas not seen her at the hour of danger?\n\nPut off the ball? why! perish the thought! The timid townsfolk of\nBrussels or the ladies of the French royalist party who were in great\nnumbers in the city might think there was something amiss. What was\namiss? some gallant young men would go on the morrow and conquer or die\nfor England's honour! there's nothing amiss in that! Why put off the\nball? The girls would be disappointed--they who like to dance--why\nshould they be deprived of partners, just because some of them would lie\ndead on the battlefield to-morrow?\n\nOpen your salons, Madame la Duchesse! The soldiers of Britain will come\nto your ball. They will laugh and dance and flirt to-night as bravely as\nthey will die to-morrow.\n\nThe sands of life are running low for them: in a few hours perhaps a\nbullet, a bayonet, who knows? will cut short that merry laugh, still the\ngallant heart that even now takes a last and fond farewell from a\nblushing partner, after a waltz, in a sweet-scented alcove with sounds\nof soft and distinct music around that stills the coming cannon's roar.\n\nGordon and Lancey, Crawford and Ponsonby and Halkett, aye! and\nWellington too! What immortal names are spoken by the flunkeys to-night\nas they usher in these brave men into the hostess' presence. The\nballroom is brilliantly illuminated with hundreds of wax candles, the\nwomen have put on their pretty dresses, displaying bare arms and\ndazzling shoulders; the men are in showy uniforms, glittering with stars\nand decorations: Orange, Brunswick, Nassau, English, Belgian, Scottish,\nFrench, all are there gay with gold and silver braid.\n\nThe confusion of tongues is greater surely than round the tower of\nBabel. German and French and English, Scots accent and Irish brogue,\npedantic Hanoverian and lusty Brunswick tones, all and more of these\nvaried sounds mingle with one another, and half-drown by their clamour\nthe sweet strains of the Viennese orchestra that discoursed dreamy\nwaltzes from behind a bower of crimson roses; whilst ponderous Flemish\nwives of city burgomasters gaze open-mouthed at the elegant ladies of\nthe old French noblesse, and shy Belgian misses peep enviously at their\nmore self-reliant English friends.\n\nAnd the hostess smiles equally graciously to all: she is ready with a\nbright word of welcome for everybody now, just as she will be anon with\na mute look of farewell, when--at ten o'clock--by Wellington's commands,\none by one, one officer after another will slip out of this hospitable\nhouse, out into the rainy night, for a hurried visit to lodgings or\nbarracks to collect a few necessaries, and then to work--to horse or\nmarch--to form into the ranks of battle as they had formed for the\nquadrille--squares to face the enemy--advance, deploy as they had done\nin the mazes of the dance! to fight as they had danced! to give their\nlife as they had given a kiss.\n\nBobby Clyffurde only saw Crystal de Cambray from afar. He had his\ncommission in Colin Halkett's brigade; his orders were the same as those\nof many others to-night: to put in an appearance at Her Grace's ball, to\ndispel any fears that might be confided to him through a fair partner's\nlips: to show confidence, courage and gaiety, and at ten o'clock to\nreport for duty.\n\nBut the crowd in the ball-room was great, and Crystal de Cambray was the\ncentre of a very close and exclusive little crowd, as indeed were all\nthe ladies of the old French noblesse, who were here in their numbers.\nThey had left their country in the wake of their dethroned king and\ndespite the anxieties and sorrows of the past three months, while the\nstar of the Corsican adventurer seemed to shine with renewed splendour,\nand that of the unfortunate King of France to be more and more on the\nwane, they had somehow filled the sleepy towns of Belgium--Ghent,\nBrussels, Charleroi--with the atmosphere of their own elegance and their\nunimpeachable good taste.\n\nClyffurde knew that the Comte de Cambray had settled in Brussels with\nhis daughter and sister, pending the new turn in the fortunes of his\ncause: the English colony there provided the royalist fugitives with\nmany friends, and Ghent was already overfull with the immediate\nentourage of the King. But Bobby had never met either the Comte or\nCrystal again.\n\nHe had crossed over to England almost directly after that final and\nfateful interview with them: he had obtained his commission and was back\nagain in Belgium--as a fighting man, ready for the work which was\nexpected from Britain's sons by the whole of Europe now.\n\nAnd to-night he saw her again. His instinct, intuition, prescience, what\nyou will, had told him that he would meet her here--and to his weary\neyes, when first he caught sight of her across the crowded room, she had\nnever seemed more exquisite, nor more desirable. She was dressed all in\nwhite, with arms and shoulders bare, her fair hair dressed in the quaint\nmode of the moment with a high comb and a multiplicity of curls. She had\na bunch of white roses in her belt and carried a shawl of gossamer lace\nthat encircled her shoulders, like a diaphanous cobweb, through which\ngleamed the shimmering whiteness of her skin.\n\nShe did not see him of course: he was only one of so many in a crowd of\nEnglish officers who were about to fight and to die for her country and\nher cause as much as for their own. But to him she was the only living,\nbreathing person in the room--all the others were phantoms or puppets\nthat had no tangible existence for him save as a setting, a background\nfor her.\n\nAnd poor Bobby would so gladly have thrown all pride to the winds for\nthe right to run straight to her across the width of the room, to fall\nat her feet, to encircle her knees, and to wring from her a word of\ncomfort or of trust. So strong was this impulse, that for one moment it\nseemed absolutely irresistible; but the next she had turned to Maurice\nde St. Genis, who was never absent from her side, and who seemed to\nhover over her with an air of proprietorship and of triumphant mastery\nwhich caused poor Bobby to grind his heel into the oak floor, and to\nsmother a bitter curse which had risen insistent to his lips.\n\n\nIII\n\nMadame la Duchesse d'Agen spoke to him once, while he stood by watching\nCrystal's dainty form walking through the mazes of a quadrille with her\nhand in that of St. Genis.\n\n\"They look well matched, do they not, Mr. Clyffurde?\" Madame said in\nbroken English and with something of her usual tartness; \"and you? are\nyou not going to recognise old friends, may I ask?\"\n\nHe turned abruptly, whilst the hot blood rushed up to his cheek, so\nsudden had been the wave of memory which flooded his brain, at the sound\nof Madame's sharp voice. Now he stooped and kissed the slender little\nhand which was being so cordially held out to him.\n\n\"Old friends, Madame la Duchesse?\" he queried with a quick sigh of\nbitterness. \"Nay! you forget that it was as a traitor and a liar that\nyou knew me last.\"\n\n\"It was as a young fool that I knew you all the time,\" she retorted\ntartly, even though a kindly look and a kindly smile tempered the\ngruffness of her sally. \"The male creature, my dear Mr. Clyffurde,\" she\nadded, \"was intended by God and by nature to be a selfish beast. When he\nceases to think of himself, he loses his bearings, flounders in a\nquagmire of unprofitable heroism which benefits no one, and generally\nbehaves like a fool.\"\n\n\"Did I do all that?\" asked Clyffurde with a smile.\n\n\"All of it and more. And look at the muddle you have made of things.\nCrystal has never got over that miserably aborted engagement of hers to\nde Marmont, and is no happier now with Maurice de St. Genis than she\nwould have been with .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. well! with anybody else who had had the good\nsense to woo and win her in a straightforward, proper and selfish\nmasculine way.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle de Cambray, I understand,\" rejoined Clyffurde stiffly, \"is\nformally affianced now to M. de St. Genis.\"\n\n\"She is not formally affianced, as you so pedantically and affectedly\nput it, my friend,\" replied Madame with her accustomed acerbity. \"But\nshe probably will marry him, if he comes out of this abominable war\nalive, and if the King of France .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. whom may God protect--comes into\nhis own again. For His Majesty has taken those two young jackanapes\nunder his most gracious protection, and has promised Maurice a lucrative\nappointment at his court--if he ever has a court again.\"\n\n\"Then Mademoiselle de Cambray must be very happy, for which--if I dare\nsay so--I am heartily rejoiced.\"\n\n\"So am I,\" said the Duchesse drily, \"but let me at the same time tell\nyou this: I have always known that Englishmen were peculiarly idiotic in\ncertain important matters of life, but I must say that I had no idea\nidiocy could reach the boundless proportions which it has done in your\ncase. Well!\" she added with sudden gentleness, \"farewell for the\npresent, mon preux chevalier: it is not too late, remember, to bear in\nmind certain old axioms both of chivalry and of commonsense--the most\nobvious of which is that nothing is gained by sitting open-mouthed,\nwhilst some one else gets the largest helpings at supper. And if it is\nany comfort to you to know that I never believed St. Genis' story of\nlonely inns, of murderous banditti and whatnots, well then, I give you\nthat information for what you may choose to make of it.\"\n\nAnd with a final friendly nod and a gentle pressure of her aristocratic\nhand on his, which warmed and comforted Bobby's sore heart, she turned\naway from him and was quickly swallowed up by the crowd.\n\n\nIV\n\nIn spite of rain and blustering wind outside the fine ballroom--as the\nevening progressed--became unpleasantly hot. Dancing was in full swing\nand the orchestra had just struck up the first strains of that\ninspiriting new dance--the latest importation from Vienna--a dreamy\nwaltz of which dowagers strongly disapproved, deeming it licentious,\nindecent, and certainly ungraceful, but which the young folk delighted\nin, and persisted in dancing, defying the mammas and all the\nproprieties.\n\nMaurice de St. Genis after the last quadrille had led Crystal away from\nthe ballroom to a small boudoir adjoining it, where the cool air from\noutside fanned the curtains and hangings and stirred the leaves and\npetals of a bank of roses that formed a background to a couple of\nseats--obviously arranged for the convenience of two persons who desired\nquiet conversation well away from prying eyes and ears.\n\nHere Crystal had been sitting with Maurice for the past quarter of an\nhour, while from the ballroom close by came as in a dream to her the\ngentle lilt of the waltz, and from behind her, a cluster of\nsweet-scented crimson roses filled the air with their fragrance. Crystal\ndidn't feel that she wanted to talk, only to sit here quietly with the\nsound of the music in her ears and the scent of roses in her nostrils.\nMaurice sat beside her, but he did not hold her hand. He was leaning\nforward with his elbows on his knees and he talked much and earnestly,\nthe while she listened half absently, like one in a dream.\n\nShe had often heard, in the olden days in England, her aunt speak of the\nstrange doings of that Doctor Mesmer in Paris who had even involved\nproud Marie Antoinette in an unpleasant scandal with his weird\nincantations and wizard-like acts, whereby people--sensible women and\nmen--were sent at his will into a curious torpor, which was neither\nsleep nor yet wakefulness, and which produced a yet more strange sense\nof unreality and dreaminess, and visions of things unsubstantial and\nunearthly.\n\nAnd sitting here surrounded with roses and with that languorous lilt in\nher ear, Crystal felt as if she too were under the influence of some\nunseen Mesmer, who had lulled the activity of her brain into a kind of\nwakeful sleep even while her senses remained keenly, vitally on the\nalert. She knew, for instance, that Maurice spoke of the coming\nstruggle, the final fight for King and country. He had been enrolled in\na Nassau regiment, under the command of the Prince of Orange: he\nexpected to be in the thick of a fight to-morrow. \"Bonaparte never\nwaits,\" Crystal heard him say quite distinctly, \"he is always ready to\nattack. Audacity and a bold use of his artillery were always his most\neffectual weapons.\"\n\nAnd he went on to tell her of his own plans, his future, his hopes: he\nspoke of the possibility of death and of this being a last farewell.\nCrystal tried to follow him, tried to respond when he spoke of his love\nfor her--a love, the strength of which--he said--she would never be able\nto gauge.\n\n\"If it were not for the strength of my love for you, Crystal,\" he said\nalmost fiercely, \"I could not bear to face possible death to-morrow\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. not without telling you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. not without making reparation for my\nsin.\"\n\nAnd still in that curious trance-like sense of aloofness, Crystal\nmurmured vaguely:\n\n\"Sin, Maurice? What sin do you mean?\"\n\nBut he did not seem to give her a direct reply: he spoke once more only\nof his love. \"Love atones for all sins!\" he reiterated once or twice\nwith passionate earnestness. \"Even God puts Love above everything on\nearth. Love is an excuse for everything. Love justifies everything.\nSuch love as I have for you, Crystal, makes everything else--even sin,\neven cowardice--seem insignificant and meaningless.\"\n\nShe agreed with what he said, for indeed she felt too tired to argue the\npoint, or even to get his sophistry into her head. Strangely enough she\nfelt out of tune with him to-night--with him--Maurice--the lover of her\ngirlhood, the man from whom she had parted with such desperate heartache\nthree months ago, in the avenue at Brestalou. Then it had seemed as if\nthe world could never hold any happiness for her again, once Maurice had\ngone out of her life. Now he had come back into it. Chance and the\nfavour of the King had once more made a future happy union with him\npossible. She ought to have been supremely happy, yet she was out of\ntune. His passionate words of love found only a cold response in her\nheart.\n\nFor the past three months she had constantly been at war with her own\nself for this: she hated and despised herself for that numbness of the\nheart which had so unaccountably taken all the zest and the joy out of\nher life. Does one love one day and become indifferent the next? What\nhad become of the girlish love that had invested Maurice de St. Genis\nwith the attributes of a hero? What had he done that the pedestal on\nwhich her ideality had hoisted him should have proved of such brittle\nclay?\n\nHe was still the gallant, high-born, well-bred gentleman whom she had\nalways known; he was on the eve of fighting for his King and country,\nready to give his life for the same cause which she loved so ardently;\nhe was even now speaking tender words of love and of farewell. Yet she\nwas out of tune with him. His words of Love almost irritated her, for\nthey dragged her out of that delicious dream-like torpor which\nmomentarily peopled the world for her with gold-headed, white-winged\nmysterious angels, and filled the air with soft murmurings and sweet\nsounds, and a divine fragrance that was not of this earth.\n\nIt must have been that she grew very sleepy--probably the heat weighed\nher eyelids down--certainly she found it impossible to keep her eyes\nopen, and Maurice apparently thought that she felt faint. Always in the\nsame vague way she heard him making suggestions for her comfort: \"Could\nhe get her some wine?\" or \"Should he try and find Madame la Duchesse?\"\n\nThen she realised how she longed for a little rest, for perfect\nsolitude, for perfect freedom to give herself over to the sweet torpor\nwhich paralysed her brain and limbs--tired, sleepy, or under the subtle\ninfluence of some mysterious agency--she did not know which she was; but\nshe did know that she would have given everything she could at this\nmoment for a few minutes' complete solitude.\n\nSo she contrived to smile and to look up almost gaily into Maurice's\nanxious face: \"I think really, Maurice,\" she said, \"I am just a little\nbit sleepy. If I could remain alone for five minutes, I would go\nhonestly to sleep and not be ashamed of myself. Could you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. could\nyou just leave me for five or ten minutes? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and, Maurice,\nwill you draw that screen a little nearer? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" she added, affecting a\nlittle yawn; \"nobody can see me then .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and really, really I shall be\nall right .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. if I could have a few minutes' quiet sleep.\"\n\n\"You shall, Crystal, of course you shall,\" said Maurice, eager and\nanxious to do all that she wanted. He arranged a cushion behind her\nhead, put a footstool to her feet and pulled the screen forward so that\nnow--where she sat--no one could see her from the ballroom, and as in\nresponse to repeated encores from the dancers, the orchestra had\nembarked upon a new waltz, she was not likely to be disturbed.\n\n\"I'll try and find Mme. la Duchesse,\" he said after he had assured\nhimself that she was quite comfortable, \"and tell her that you are quite\nwell, but must not be disturbed.\"\n\nShe caught his hand and gave it a little squeeze.\n\n\"You are kind, Maurice,\" she murmured.\n\nShe felt exactly like a tired child, now that she had been made so\ncomfortable, and she liked Maurice so much, oh! so much! no brother\ncould have been dearer.\n\n\"You won't go way without waking me, Maurice,\" she said as he bent down\nto kiss her.\n\n\"No, no, of course not,\" he replied; \"it still wants a quarter before\nten.\"\n\nThe screen shut off all the glare from the candles. The sense of\nisolation was complete and delicious: the roses smelt very sweet, the\nsoft strains of the waltz sounded like elfin music.\n\n\nV\n\nLike elfin music--tender, fitful, dreamy!--an exquisite languor stole\ninto Crystal's limbs. She was not asleep, yet she was in dreamland--all\nalone in semi-darkness, that was restful and soothing, and with the\nfragrance of crimson roses in her nostrils and their velvety petals\nbrushing against her cheek.\n\nLike elfin music!--sweet strains of infinite sadness--the tune of the\nInfinite mingling with the semblance of reality!\n\nLike elfin music--or like the voice of a human being in pain--the note\nof sadness became the only real note now!\n\nWhat really happened after this Crystal never rightly knew. Whenever in\nthe future her memory went back to this hour, she could not be sure\nwhether in truth she had been waking or dreaming, or at what precise\nmoment she became fully conscious of a presence close beside her--just\nbehind the bank of roses--and of a voice--low, earnest, quivering with\npassionate emotion--that reached her ear as if through the tender\nmelodies played by the orchestra.\n\nIt almost seemed to her--when she thought over all the circumstances in\nher mind--that she must have been subtly conscious of the presence all\nalong--all the while that Maurice was still with her and she felt so\ncuriously languid, longing only for darkness and solitude.\n\nSomething encompassed her now that she could not define: the warmth of\nLove, the sense of protection and security--almost as if unseen arms,\nthat were strong and devoted and selfless, held her closely, shielding\nher from evil and from the taint of selfish human passions.\n\nAnd presently she heard her name--whispered low and with a note of\ntender appeal.\n\nHer eyes were closed and she paid no heed: but the appeal was once more\nwhispered--this time more insistently, and almost against her will she\nmurmured:\n\n\"Who calls?\"\n\n\"An unfortunate whom you hate and despise, and who would have given his\nlife to serve you.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\" she reiterated.\n\n\"A poor heart-broken wretch who could not keep away from your side, and\nlonged for one more sound of your voice even though it uttered words\nmore cruel than man can stand.\"\n\n\"What would you like to hear?\"\n\n\"One word of comfort to ease that terrible sting of hate which has\nburned into my very soul, till every minute of life has become\nunendurable agony.\"\n\n\"How could I know,\" she asked, and now her eyes were wide open, gazing\nout into nothingness, not turned yet in the direction whence that\ndream-voice came: \"how could I know that my hatred made you suffer or\nthat you cared for comfort from me?\"\n\n\"How could you know, Crystal?\" the voice replied. \"You could know that,\nmy dear, just as surely as you know that in a stormy night the sky is\ndark, just as you know that when heavy clouds obscure the blue ether\nabove, no ray of sunshine warms the shivering earth. Just as you know\nthat you are beautiful and exquisite, so you knew, Crystal, that I loved\nyou from the deepest depths of my soul.\"\n\n\"How could I guess?\"\n\n\"By that subtle sense which every human being has. And you did guess it,\nCrystal, else you would not have hated me as you did.\"\n\n\"I hated you because I thought you a traitor.\"\n\n\"Is it too late to swear to you that my only thought was to serve you?\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"By working against my King and country?\" she retorted with just this\none brief flash of her old vehemence.\n\n\"By working for my country and for yours. This I swear by your sweet\neyes--by your dear mouth that hurt me so cruelly that evening--I swear\nit by the damnable agony which you made me endure .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. by the abject\ncowardice which dragged me to your side now like a whining wretch that\ncraves for a crumb of comfort .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. by all that you have made me suffer.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Crystal, I swear to you that I was never false .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. false, great\nGod! when with every drop of my blood, with every fibre of my heart,\nwith every nerve, every sinew, every thought I love you.\"\n\nThe voice was so low, never above a whisper, and all around her Crystal\nfelt again that delicious sense of warmth--the breath of Love that\nbrings man's heart so near to God--the sense of security in a man's\nall-encompassing Love which women prize above everything else on earth.\n\nThe music was just an accompaniment to that low, earnest whispering; the\nsoft strains of the violins made it still seem like a voice that comes\nthrough a veil of dreams. Instinctively Crystal began to hum the\nwaltz-tune and her little head with its quaint coronet of fair curls\nbeat time to the languid lilt.\n\n\"Will you dance with me, Crystal?\"\n\n\"No! no!\" she protested.\n\n\"Just once--to-night. To-morrow we fight--let us dance to-night.\"\n\nAnd before she could protest further, her will seemed to fall away from\nher: she knew that her father, her aunt would be angry, that--as like as\nnot--Maurice would make a scene. She knew that Maurice--to whom she had\nplighted her troth--had branded this man as a liar and a traitor: her\nfather believed him to be a traitor, and she .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Well! what had he\ndone to disprove Maurice's accusations? A few words of passionate\nprotestations! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Did they count? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. He wore his King's\nuniform--many careless adventurers did that these strenuous times! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\n\nAnd he wanted her to dance .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0! how could she--Crystal de Cambray,\nthe future wife of the Marquis de St. Genis, the cynosure of a great\nmany eyes to-night--how could she show herself in public on his arm, in\na crowded ballroom?\n\nYet she could not refuse. She could not. Surely it was all a dream, and\nin a dream man is but the slave of circumstance and has no will of his\nown.\n\nShe was very young and loved to dance: and she had heard that Englishmen\ndanced well. Besides, it was all a dream. She would wake in a moment or\ntwo and find herself sitting quietly among the roses with Maurice beside\nher, telling her of his love, and of their happy future together.\n\n\nVI\n\nBut in the meanwhile the dream was lasting. Her partner was a perfect\ndancer, and this new, delicious waltz--inspiriting yet languorous,\nrhythmical and half barbaric--sent a keen feeling of joy and of zest\ninto Crystal's whole being.\n\nShe was not conscious of the many stares that were levelled at her as\nshe suddenly appeared among the crowd in the ballroom, her face flushed\nwith excitement, her perfect figure moving with exquisite grace to the\nmeasure of the dance.\n\nThe last dance together!\n\nA few moments before, Clyffurde had made his way to the small boudoir in\nsearch of fresh air, and had withdrawn to a window embrasure away from a\nthrong that maddened him in his misery of loneliness: then he realised\nthat Crystal was sitting quite close to him, that St. Genis, who had\nbeen in constant attendance on her, presently left her to herself and\nthat without even moving from where he was he could whisper into her ear\nthat which had lain so heavily on his heart that at times he had felt\nthat it must break under the intolerable load.\n\nThen as the soft strains of the music from the orchestra struck upon his\near, the insistent whim seized him to make her dance with him, just\nonce--to-night. To-morrow the cannon would roar once more--to-morrow\nEurope would make yet another stand against the bold adventurer whom\nseemingly nothing could crush.\n\nTo-morrow a bullet--a bayonet--a sword-thrust--but to-night a last dance\ntogether.\n\nThose whims come at times to those who are doomed to die. Clyffurde's\none hope of peace lay in death upon the battlefield. Life was empty now.\nHe had fought against the burden of loneliness left upon him when\nCrystal passed finally out of his life. But the burden had proved\nunconquerable. Only death could ease him of the load: for life like this\nwas stupid and intolerable.\n\nMen would die within the next few days in their hundreds and in their\nthousands: men who were happy, who had wives and children, men on whose\nlives Love shed its happy radiance. Then why not he? who was more lonely\nthan any man on earth--left lonely because the one woman who filled all\nthe world for him, hated him and was gone from him for ever.\n\nBut a last dance with her to-night! The right to hold her in his arms!\nthis he had never done, though his muscles had often ached with the\nlonging to hold her. But dancing with her he could feel her against him,\nclasp her closely, feel her breath against his cheek.\n\nShe was not very tall and her head--had she chosen--could just have\nrested in the hollow of his shoulder. The thought of it sent the blood\nrushing hotly to his head and with his two strong hands he would at that\nmoment have bent a bar of iron, or smashed something to atoms, in order\nto crush that longing to curse against Fate, against his destiny that\nhad so wantonly dangled happiness before him, only to thrust him into\nutter loneliness again.\n\nThen he spoke to her--and finally asked for the dance.\n\nAnd now he held her, and guided her through the throng, her tiny feet\nmoving in unison with his. And all the world had vanished: he had her to\nhimself, for these few happy moments he could hold her and refuse to let\nher go. He did not care--nor did she--that many curious and some angry\nglances followed their every movement. Till the last bar was played,\ntill the final chord was struck she was absolutely his--for she had\ngiven up her will to him.\n\nThe last dance together! He sent his heart to her, all his heart--and\nthe music helped him, and the rhythm; the very atmosphere of the\nroom--rose-scented--helped him to make her understand. He could have\nkissed her hair, so close were the heaped-up fair curls to his mouth; he\ncould have whispered to her, and nobody would hear: he could have told\nher something at any rate, of that love which had filled his heart since\nall time, not months or years since he had known her, but since all time\nfilling every minute of his life. He could have taught her what love\nmeant, thrilled her heart with thoughts of might-have-been; he could\nhave roused sweet pity in her soul, love's gentle mother that has the\npower to give birth to Love.\n\nBut he did not kiss her, nor did he speak: because though he was quite\nsure that she would understand, he was equally sure that she could not\nrespond. She was not his--not his in the world of realities, at any\nrate. Her heart belonged to the friend of her childhood, the only man\nwhom she would ever love--the man by whom he--poor Bobby!--had been\ncontent to be defamed and vilified in order that she should remain happy\nin her ideals and in her choice. So he was content only to hold her, his\narm round her waist, one hand holding hers imprisoned--she herself\nbecoming more and more the creature of his dreams, the angel that\nhaunted him in wakefulness and in sleep: immortally his bride, yet never\nto be wholly his again as she was now in this heavenly moment where they\nstood together within the pale of eternity.\n\nIn this, their last dance together!\n\n\nVII\n\nFar into the night, into the small hours of the morning, Crystal de\nCambray sat by the open window of her tiny bedroom in the small\napartment which her father had taken for himself and his family in the\nrue du Marais.\n\nShe sat, with one elbow resting on the window-sill, her right hand\nfingering, with nervy, febrile movements, a letter which she held.\nJeanne had handed it to her when she came home from the ball: M. de St.\nGenis, Jeanne explained, had given it to her earlier in the evening\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. soon after ten o'clock it must have been .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. M. le Marquis\nseemed in a great hurry, but he made Jeanne swear most solemnly that\nMademoiselle Crystal should have the letter as soon as she came home\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. also M. le Marquis had insisted that the letter should be given to\nMademoiselle when she was alone.\n\nNot a little puzzled--for had she not taken fond leave of Maurice\nshortly before ten o'clock, when he had told her that his orders were\nto quit the ball then and report himself at once at headquarters. He had\nseemed very despondent, Crystal thought, and the words which he spoke\nwhen finally he kissed her, had in them all the sadness of a last\nfarewell. Crystal even had felt a tinge of remorse--when she saw how sad\nhe was--that she had not responded more warmly to his kiss. It almost\nseemed as if her heart rebelled against it, and when he pressed her with\nhis accustomed passionate ardour to his breast, she had felt a curious\nshrinking within herself, a desire to push him away, even though her\nwhole heart went out to him with pity and with sorrow.\n\nAnd now here was this letter. Crystal was a long time before she made up\nher mind to open it: the paper--damp with the rain--seemed to hold a\ncertain fatefulness within its folds. At last she read the letter, and\nlong after she had read it she sat at the open window, listening to the\ndreary, monotonous patter of the rain, and to the distant sounds of\nmoving horses and men, the rattle of wheels, the bugle calls, the\ndeparture of the allied troops to meet the armies of the great\nadventurer on the billowing plains of Belgium.\n\nThis is what Maurice had written to her a few moments before he left;\nand it must have taken him some time to pen the lengthy epistle.\n\n     \"MY BEAUTIFUL CRYSTAL,\n\n     \"I may never come back. Something tells me that my life,\n     such as it is--empty and worthless enough, God knows--has\n     nearly run its full course. But if I do come back to claim\n     the happiness which your love holds out for me,--I will not\n     face you again with so deep a stain upon mine honour. I did\n     not tell you before because I was too great a coward. I\n     could not bear to think that you would despise me--I could\n     not encounter the look of contempt in your eyes: so I\n     remained silent to the call of honour. And now I speak\n     because the next few hours will atone for everything. If I\n     come back you will forgive. If I fall you will mourn. In\n     either case I shall be happy that you know. Crystal! in all\n     my life I spoke only one lie, and that was three months\n     ago, when I set out to reclaim the King's money, which had\n     been filched from you on the high road, and returned\n     empty-handed. I found the money and I found the thief. No\n     thief he, Crystal, but just a quixotic man, who desired to\n     serve his country, our cause and you. That man was your\n     friend Mr. Clyffurde. I don't think that I was ever jealous\n     of him. I am not jealous of him now. Our love, Crystal, is\n     too great and too strong to fear rivalry from anyone. He\n     had taken the money from you because he knew that Victor de\n     Marmont, with a strong body of men to help him, would have\n     filched it from you for the benefit of the Corsican. He\n     took the money from you because he knew that neither you\n     nor the Comte would have listened to any warnings from him.\n     He took the money from you with the sole purpose of\n     conveying it to the King. Then I found him and taunted him,\n     until the temptation came to me to act the part of a coward\n     and a traitor. And this I did, Crystal, only because I\n     loved you--because I knew that I could never win you while\n     I was poor and in humble circumstances. I soon found out\n     that Clyffurde was a friend. I begged him to let me have\n     the money so that I might take it to the King and earn\n     consideration and a reward thereby. That was my sin,\n     Crystal, and also that I lied to you to disguise the sorry\n     r\u00c3\u00b4le which I had played. Clyffurde gave me the money\n     because I told him how we loved one another--you and I--and\n     that happiness could only come to you through our mutual\n     love. He acted well, though in truth I meant to do him no\n     wrong. Later Victor de Marmont came upon me, and wrested\n     the money from me, and I was helpless to guard that for\n     which I had played the part of a coward.\n\n     \"I have eased my soul by telling you this, Crystal, and I\n     know that no hard thoughts of me will dwell in your mind\n     whilst I do all that a man can do for honour, King and\n     country.\n\n     \"Remember that the next few hours, perhaps, will atone for\n     everything, and that Love excuses all things.\n\n     \"Yours in love and sorrow,\n\n     \"MAURICE.\"\n\nThe letter, crumpled and damp, remained in Crystal's hand all the while\nthat she sat by the open window, and the sound of moving horses and men\nin the distance conjured up before her eyes mental visions of all that\nto-morrow might mean. The letter was damp with her tears now, they had\nfallen incessantly on the paper while she re-read it a second time and\nthen re-read it again.\n\nA quixotic man! Maurice said airily. How little he understood! How well\nshe--Crystal--knew what had been the motive of that quixotic action. She\nhad learned so much to-night in the mazes of a waltz. Now, when she\nclosed her eyes, she could still feel the dreamy motion with that strong\narm round her, and she could hear the sweet, languid lilt of the music,\nand all the delicious elvish whisperings that reached her ear through\nthe monotonous cadence of the dance. Of what her heart had felt then,\nshe need now no longer be ashamed: all that should shame her now were\nher thoughts in the past, the belief that the hand which had held hers\non that evening--long ago--in Brestalou could possibly have been the\nhand of a traitor: that the low-toned voice that spoke to her so\nearnestly of friendship then could ever be raised for the utterance of a\nlie.\n\nOf such thoughts indeed she could be ashamed, and of her cruelty that\nother night in Paris, when she had made him suffer so abominably through\nher injustice and her contempt.\n\n\"The next few hours, perhaps, will atone for everything,\" Maurice had\nadded. Ah, well! perhaps! But they could not erase the past; they could\nnot control the more distant future. Maurice would come back--Crystal\nprayed earnestly that he should--but Clyffurde was gone out of her life\nfor ever. God alone knew how this renewed war would end! How could she\nhope ever to meet a friend who had gone away determined never to see her\nagain?\n\nA last dance together! Well! they had had it! and that was the end. The\nend of a sweet romance that had had no beginning. He had gone now, as\nMaurice had gone, as all the men had gone who had listened to their\ncountry's call, and she, Crystal, could not convey to him even by a\nmessage, by a word, that she understood all that he had done for her,\nall that his actions had meant of devotion, of self-effacement, of pure\nand tender Love.\n\nA last dance together, and that had been the end. Even thoughts of him\nwould be forbidden her after this: for her thoughts were no longer free\nof him, her heart was no longer free; her promise belonged to Maurice,\nbut her heart, her thoughts were no longer hers to give.\n\nIt was all too late! too late! the next few hours might atone for the\npast but they could not call it back.\n\nWeary and heart-sick Crystal crawled into bed when the grey light of\ndawn peeped cold and shy into her room. She could not sleep, but she lay\nquite still while one by one those distant sounds died away in the misty\nmorning. In this semi-dreamlike state it seemed to her as if she must be\nable to distinguish the sound of _his_ horse's hoofs from among a\nthousand others: it seemed as if something in herself must tell her\nquite plainly where he was, what he did, when he got to horse, which way\nhe went. And presently she closed her eyes against the grey, monotonous\nlight, and during one brief moment she felt deliciously conscious of a\nsweet, protecting presence somewhere near her, of soft whisperings of\nfondness and of friendship: the sound of a dream-voice reached her ear\nand once again as in the sweet-scented alcove she felt herself\nmurmuring: \"Who calls?\" and once more she heard the tender wailing as of\na stricken soul in pain: \"A poor heart-broken wretch who could not keep\naway from your side.\"\n\nAnd memory-echoes lingered round her, bringing back every sound of his\nmellow voice, every look in his eyes, the touch of his hand--oh! that\nexquisite touch!--and his last words before he asked her to dance:\n\"With every drop of my blood, with every nerve, every sinew, every\nthought I love you.\"\n\nAnd her heart with a long-drawn-out moan of unconquerable sorrow sent\nout into the still morning air its agonised call in reply:\n\n\"Come back, my love, come back! I cannot live without you! You have\ntaught me what Love is--pure, selfless and protecting--you cannot go\nfrom me now--you cannot. In the name of that Love which your tender\nvoice has brought into being, come back to me. Do not leave me\ndesolate!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE TARPEIAN ROCK\n\n\nI\n\nRain, rain! all the morning! God's little tool--innocent-looking little\ntool enough--for the remodelling of the destinies of this world.\n\nGod chose to soak the earth on that day--and the formidable artillery\nthat had swept the plateau of Austerlitz, the vales of Marengo, the\ncemetery of Eylau, was rendered useless for the time being because up in\nthe inscrutable kingdom of the sky a cloud had chosen to burst--or had\nburst by the will of God--and water soaked the soft, spongy soil of\nBelgium and the wheels of artillery wagons sank axle-deep in the mud.\n\nIf only the ground had been dry! if only the great gambler--the genius,\nthe hero, call him what you will, but the gambler for all that--if only\nhe had staked his crown, his honour and that of Imperial France on some\nother stake than his artillery! If only .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0! But who shall tell?\n\nIs it indeed a cloud-burst that changed the whole destinies of Europe?\nYe materialists, ye philosophers! answer that.\n\nIs it to the rain that fell in such torrents until close on midday of\nthat stupendous 18th of June, that must be ascribed this wonderful and\nall-embracing change that came over the destinies of myriads of people,\nof entire nations, kingdoms and empires? Rather is it not because God\njust on that day of all days chose to show this world of pigmies--great\nmen, valiant heroes, controlling genius and all-powerful\nconquerors--the entire extent of His might--so far and no further--and\nin order to show it, He selected that simple, seemingly futile means\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. just a heavy shower of rain.\n\nAt half-past eleven the cannon began to roar on the plains of Mont Saint\nJean,[2] but not before. Before that it had rained: rained heavily, and\nthe ground was soaked through, and the all-powerful artillery of the\nmost powerful military genius of all times was momentarily powerless.\n\n[Footnote 2: _i.e._ Waterloo.]\n\nHad it not rained so persistently and so long that same compelling\nartillery would have begun its devastating work earlier in the day--at\nsix mayhap, or mayhap at dawn, another five, six, seven hours to add to\nthe length of that awful day: another five, six, seven hours wherein to\ntax the tenacity, the heroic persistence of the British troops: another\nfive, six, seven hours of dogged resistance on the one side, of\nimpetuous charges on the other, before the arrival of Bl\u00c3\u00bccher and his\nPrussians and the turning of the scales of blind Justice against the\ndaring gambler who had staked his all.\n\nBut it was only at half-past eleven that the cannon began to roar, and\nthe undulating plain carried the echo like a thunder-roll from heaving\nbillow to heaving billow till it broke against the silent majesty of the\nforest of Soigne.\n\nHere with the forest as a background is the highest point of Mont\nSaint Jean: and here beneath an overhanging elm--all day on\nhorseback--anxious, frigid and heroic, is Wellington--with a rain of\nbullets all round him, watching, ceaselessly watching that horizon far\naway, wrapped now in fog, anon in smoke and soon in gathering darkness:\nwatching for the promised Prussian army that was to ease the terrible\nburden of that desperate stand which the British troops were bearing and\nhad borne all day with such unflinching courage and dogged tenacity.\n\nIt is in vain that his aides-de-camp beg him to move away from that\nperilous position.\n\n\"My lord,\" cries Lord Hill at last in desperation, \"if you are killed,\nwhat are we to do?\"\n\n\"The same as I do now,\" replies Wellington unmoved, \"hold this place to\nthe last man.\"\n\nThen with a sudden outburst of vehemence, that seems to pierce almost\ninvoluntarily the rigid armour of British phlegm and British\nself-control, he calls to his old comrades of Salamanca and Vittoria:\n\n\"Boys, which of us now can think of retreating? What would England think\nof us, if we do?\"\n\nHeroic, unflinching and cool the British army has held its ground\nagainst the overwhelming power of Napoleon's magnificent cavalry. Raw\nrecruits some of them, against the veterans of Jena and of Wagram! But\nthey have been ordered to hold the place to the last man, and in close\nand serried squares they have held their ground ever since half-past\neleven this morning, while one after another the flower of Napoleon's\nworld-famed cavalry had been hurled against them.\n\nCuirassiers, chasseurs, lancers, up they come to the charge, like\nwhirlwinds up the declivities of the plateau. Like a whirlwind they rush\nupon those stolid, immovable, impenetrable squares, attacking from every\nside, making violent, obstinate, desperate onsets upon the stubborn\nangles, the straight, unshakable walls of red coats; slashing at the\nbayonets with their swords, at crimson breasts with their lances, firing\ntheir pistols right between those glowing eyes, right into those firm\njaws and set teeth.\n\nThe sound of bullets on breastplates and helmets and epaulettes is like\na shower of hailstones upon a sheet of metal.\n\nTwice, thrice, nay more--a dozen times--they return to the charge, and\nthe plateau gleams with brandished steel like a thousand flashes of\nsimultaneous fork-lightning on the vast canopy of a stormy sky.\n\nFrom midday till after four, a kind of mysterious haze covers this field\nof noble deeds. Fog after the rain wraps the gently-billowing Flemish\nground in a white semi-transparent veil--covers with impartial coolness\nall the mighty actions, the heroic charges and still more heroic stands,\nall the silent uncomplaining sufferings, the glorious deaths, all the\ncourage and all the endurance.\n\nThrough the grey mists we see a medley of moving colours--blue and grey\nand scarlet and black--of shakos and sabretaches, of English and French\nand Hanoverian and Scotch, of epaulettes and bare knees; we hear the\nsound of carbine and artillery fire, the clank of swords and bayonets,\nthe call of bugle and trumpet and the wail of the melancholy pibroch:\ntunics and gold tassels and kilts--a medley of sounds and of visions!\n\nWe see the attack on Hougoumont--the appearance of B\u00c3\u00bclow on the heights\nof Saint Lambert--the charge of the Inniskillings and the Scots\nGreys--the death of valiant Ponsonby. We see Marshal Ney Prince of\nMoskowa--the bravest soldier in France--we see him everywhere where the\nm\u00c3\u00aal\u00c3\u00a9e is thickest, everywhere where danger is most nigh. His magnificent\nuniform torn to shreds, his gold lace tarnished, his hair and whiskers\nsinged, his face blackened by powder, indomitable, unconquered, superb,\nwe hear him cry: \"Where are those British bullets? Is there not one left\nfor me?\"\n\nHe knows--none better!--that the plains of Mont Saint Jean are the great\ngambling tables on which the supreme gambler--Napoleon, once Emperor of\nthe French and master of half the world--had staked his all. \"If we come\nout of this alive and conquered,\" he cries to Heym\u00c3\u00a8s, his aide-de-camp,\n\"there will only be the hangman's rope left for us all.\"\n\nAnd we see the gambler himself--Napoleon, Emperor still and still\ncertain of victory--on horseback all day, riding from end to end of his\nlines; he is gayer than he has ever been before. At Marengo he was\ndespondent, at Austerlitz he was troubled: but at Waterloo he has no\ndoubts. The star of his destiny has risen more brilliant than ever\nbefore.\n\n\"The day of France's glory has only just dawned,\" he calls, and his mind\nis full of projects--the triumphant march back into Paris--the Germans\ndriven back to the Rhine--the English to the sea.\n\nHis only anxiety--and it is a slight one still--is that Grouchy with his\nfresh troops is so late in arriving.\n\nStill, the Prussians are late too, and the British cannot hold the place\nfor ever.\n\n\nII\n\nAt three o'clock the fog lifts--the veil that has wrapped so many\nsounds, such awful and wonderful visions, in a kind of mystery, is\nlifted now, and it reveals .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. what? Hougoumont invested--Brave Baring\nthere with a handful of men--English, German, Brunswickians--making a\nlast stand with ten rounds of ammunition left to them per man, and the\nFrench engineers already battering in the gates of the enclosing wall\nthat surrounds the ch\u00c3\u00a2teau and chapel of Goumont: the farm of La Haye\nSainte taken--Ney there with his regiment of cuirassiers and five\nbattalions of the Old Guard: and the English lines on the heights of\nMont Saint Jean apparently giving way.\n\nWe see too a vast hecatomb: glory and might must claim their many\nthousand victims: the dead and dying lie scattered like pawns upon an\nabandoned chessboard, the humble pawns in this huge and final gamble for\nsupremacy and power, for national existence and for liberty. Hougoumont,\nLa Haye Sainte, Papelotte are sown with illustrious dead--but on the\nplateau of Mont Saint Jean the British still hold their ground.\n\nWellington is still there on the heights, with the majestic trees of\nSoigne behind him, the stately canopy of the elm above his head--more\nfrigid than before, more heroic, but also more desperately anxious.\n\n\"Bl\u00c3\u00bccher or nightfall,\" he sighs as a fresh cavalry charge is hurled\nagainst those indomitable British squares. The thirteenth assault, and\nstill they stand or kneel on one knee, those gallant British boys;\nbayonet in hand or carbine, they fire, fall out and re-form again:\nshaken, hustled, encroached on they may be, but still they stand and\nfire with coolness and precision .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. the ranks are not broken yet.\n\nOfficers ride up to the field-marshal to tell him that the situation has\nbecome desperate, their regiments decimated, their men exhausted. They\nask for fresh orders: but he has only one answer for them:\n\n\"There are no fresh orders, save to hold out to the last man.\"\n\nAnd down in the valley at La Belle Alliance is the great gambler--the\nman who to-day will either be Emperor again--a greater, mightier monarch\nthan even he has ever been--or who will sink to a status which perhaps\nthe meanest of his erstwhile subjects would never envy.\n\nBut just now--at four o'clock--when the fog has lifted--he is flushed\nwith excitement, exultant in the belief in victory.\n\nThe English centre on Mont Saint Jean is giving way at last, he is told.\n\n\"The beginning of retreat!\" he cries.\n\nAnd he, who had been anxious at Austerlitz, despondent at Marengo, is\ngay and happy and brimming full of hope.\n\n\"De Marmont,\" he calls to his faithful friend, \"De Marmont, go ride to\nParis now; tell them that victory is ours! No, no,\" he adds excitedly,\n\"don't go all the way--ride to Genappe and send a messenger to Paris\nfrom there--then come back to be with us in the hour of victory.\"\n\nAnd Victor de Marmont rides off in order to proclaim to the world at\nlarge the great victory which the Emperor has won this day over all the\narmies of Europe banded and coalesced against him.\n\n\nFrom far away on the road of Ohain has come the first rumour that\nBl\u00c3\u00bccher and his body of Prussians are nigh--still several hours' march\nfrom Waterloo but advancing--advancing. For hours Wellington has been\nwatching for them, until wearily he has sighed: \"Bl\u00c3\u00bccher or nightfall\nalone can save us from annihilation now.\"\n\nThe rumour--oh! it was merely the whispering of the wind, but still a\nrumour nevertheless--means fresh courage to tired, half-spent troops.\nEven deeds of unparalleled heroism need the stimulus of renewed hope\nsometimes.\n\nThe rumour has also come to the ears of the Emperor, of Ney and of all\nthe officers of the staff. They all know that those magnificent British\ntroops whom they have fought all day must be nigh to their final\ndesperate effort at last--with naught left to them but their stubborn\ncourage and that tenacity which has been ever since the wonder of the\nworld.\n\nThey know, these brave soldiers of Napoleon--who have fought and admired\nthe brave foe--that the 1st and 2nd Life Guards are decimated by now;\nthat entire British and German regiments are cut up; that Picton is\ndead, the Scots Greys almost annihilated. They know what havoc their\nhuge cavalry charges have made in the magnificent squares of British\ninfantry; they know that heroism and tenacity and determination must\ngive way at last before superior numbers, before fresh troops, before\npersistent, ever-renewed attacks.\n\nOnly a few fresh troops and Ney declares that he can conquer the final\ndogged endurance of the British troops, before they in their turn\nreceive the support of Bl\u00c3\u00bccher and his Prussians, or before nightfall\ngives them a chance of rest.\n\nSo he sends Colonel Heym\u00c3\u00a8s to his Emperor with the urgent message: \"More\ntroops, I entreat, more troops and I can break the English centre before\nthe Prussians come!\"\n\nNone knew better than he that this was the great hazard on which the\nlife and honour of his Emperor had been staked, that Imperial France was\nfighting hand to hand with Great Britain, each for her national\nexistence, each for supremacy and might and the honour of her flag.\n\nImperial France--bold, daring, impetuous!\n\nGreat Britain--tenacious, firm and impassive!\n\nWellington under the elm-tree, calmly scanning the horizon while bullets\nwhiz past around his head, and ordering his troops to hold on to the\nlast man!\n\nThe Emperor on horseback under a hailstorm of shot and shell and bullets\nriding from end to end of his lines!\n\nNey and his division of cuirassiers and grenadiers of the Old Guard had\njust obeyed the Emperor's last orders which had been to take La Haye\nSainte at all costs: and the intrepid Mar\u00c3\u00a9chal now, flushed with\nvictory, had sent his urgent message to Napoleon:\n\n\"More troops! and I can yet break through the English centre before the\narrival of the Prussians.\"\n\n\"More troops?\" cried the Emperor in despair, \"where am I to get them\nfrom? Am I a creator of men?\"\n\nAnd from far away the rumour: \"Bl\u00c3\u00bccher and the Prussians are nigh!\"\n\n\"Stop that rumour from spreading to the ears of our men! In God's name\ndon't let them know it,\" adjures Napoleon in a message to Ney.\n\nAnd he himself sends his own staff officers to every point of the field\nof battle to shout and proclaim the news that it is Grouchy who is\nnigh, Grouchy with reinforcements, Grouchy with the victorious troops\nfrom Ligny, fresh from conquered laurels!\n\nAnd the news gives fresh heart to the Imperial troops:\n\n\"Vive l'Empereur!\" they shout, more certain than ever of victory.\n\n\nIII\n\nThe grey day has yielded at last to the kiss of the sun. Far away at\nBraine l'Alleud a vivid streak of gold has rent the bank of heavy\nclouds. It is now close on seven o'clock--there are two more hours to\nnightfall and Bl\u00c3\u00bccher is not yet here.\n\nSome of the Prussians have certainly debouched on Plancenoit, but\nNapoleon's Old Guard have turned them out again, and from Limale now\ncomes the sound of heavy cannonade as if Grouchy had come upon Bl\u00c3\u00bccher\nafter all and all hopes of reinforcements for the British troops were\nfinally at an end.\n\nNapoleon--Emperor still and still flushed with victory--looks through\nhis glasses on the British lines: to him it seems that these are shaken,\nthat Wellington is fighting with the last of his men. This is the hour\nthen when victory waits--attentive, ready to bestow her crown on him who\ncan hold out and fight the longest--on him who at the last can deliver\nthe irresistible attack.\n\nAnd Napoleon gives the order for the final attack, which must be more\nformidable, more overpowering than any that have gone before. The\nplateau of Mont Saint Jean, he commands, must be carried at all costs!\n\nCuirassiers, lancers and grenadiers, then, once more to the charge!\nstrew once more the plains of Waterloo with your dying and your dead!\nUp, Milhaud, with your guards! Poret with your grenadiers! Michel with\nyour chasseurs! Up, ye heroes of a dozen campaigns, of a hundred\nvictories! Up, ye old growlers with the fur bonnets--Napoleon's\ninvincible Old Guard! With Ney himself to lead you! a hero among heroes!\nthe bravest where all are brave!\n\nHave you ever seen a tidal wave of steel rising and surging under the\nlash of the gale? So they come now, those cuirassiers and lancers and\nchasseurs, their helmets, their swords, their lances gleaming in the\ngolden light of the sinking sun; in closed ranks, stirrup to stirrup\nthey swoop down into the valley, and rise again scaling the muddy\nheights. Superb as on parade, with their finest generals at their head:\nMilhaud, Hanrion, Michel, Mallet! and Ney between them all.\n\nSplendid they are and certain of victory: they gallop past as if at a\nrevue on the Place du Carrousel opposite the windows of the Tuileries;\nall to the repeated cry of \"Vive l'Empereur!\"\n\nAnd as they gallop past the wounded and the dying lift themselves up\nfrom the blood-stained earth, and raise their feeble voices to join in\nthat triumphant call: \"Vive l'Empereur!\" There's an old veteran there,\nwho fought at Austerlitz and at Jena; he has three stripes upon his\nsleeve, but both his legs are shattered and he lies on the roadside\npropped up against a hedge, and as the superb cavalry ride proudly by he\nshouts lustily: \"Forward, comrades! a last victorious charge! Long live\nthe Emperor!\"\n\n\nAfter that who was to blame? Was human agency to blame? Did Ney--the\nfinest cavalry leader in Napoleon's magnificent army, the veteran of an\nhundred glorious victories--did he make the one blunder of his military\ncareer by dividing his troops into too many separate columns rather than\nconcentrating them for the one all-powerful attack upon the British\ncentres? Did he indeed mistake the way and lead his splendid cavalry by\nround-about crossways to the plateau instead of by the straight Brussels\nroad?\n\nOr did the obscure traitor--over whom history has thrown a veil of\nmystery--betray this fresh advance against the British centre to\nWellington?\n\nWas any man to blame? Was it not rather the hand of God that had already\nfallen with almighty and divine weight upon the ambitious and reckless\nadventurer?--was it not the voice of God that spoke to him through the\ncannon's roar of Waterloo: \"So far but no farther shalt thou go! Enough\nof thy will and thy power and thy ambition!--Enough of this scourge of\nbloodshed and of misery which I have allowed thee to wield for so\nlong!--Enough of devastated homes, of starvation and of poverty! enough\nof the fatherless and of the widow!\"\n\nAnd up above on the plateau the British troops hear the thunder of\nthousands of horses' hoofs, galloping--galloping to this last charge\nwhich must be irresistible. And sturdy, wearied hands, black with powder\nand stained with blood, grasp more firmly still the bayonet, the rifle\nor the carbine, and they wait--those exhausted, intrepid, valiant men!\nthey wait for that thundering charge, with wide-open eyes fixed upon the\ncrest of the hill--they wait for the charge--they are ready for\ndeath--but they are not prepared to yield.\n\nAlong the edge of the plateau in a huge semicircle that extends from\nHougoumont to the Brussels road the British gunners wait for the order\nto fire.\n\nBehind them Wellington--eagle-eyed and calm, warned by God--or by a\ntraitor but still by God--of the coming assault on his positions--scours\nthe British lines from end to end: valiant Maitland is there with his\nbrigade of guards, and Adam with his artillery: there are Vandeleur's\nand Vivian's cavalry and Colin Halkett's guards! heroes all! ready to\ndie and hearing the approach of Death in that distant roar of\nthunder--the onrush of Napoleon's invincible cavalry.\n\nHere, too, further out toward the east and the west, extending the\nBritish lines as far as Nivelles on one side and Brussels on the other,\nare William Halkett's Hanoverians, Duplat's German brigade, the Dutch\nand the Belgians, the Brunswickers, and Ompteda's decimated corps. The\nFrench royalists are here too, scattered among the foreign\ntroops--brother prepared to fight brother to the death! St. Genis is\namong the Brunswickers. But Bobby Clyffurde is with Maitland's guards.\n\nAnd now the wave of steel is surging up the incline: the gleam of\nshining metal pierces the distant haze, casques and lances glitter in\nthe slowly sinking sun, whilst from billow to billow the echo brings to\nstraining ears the triumphant cry \"Vive l'Empereur!\"\n\nFive minutes later the British artillery ranged along the crest has made\na huge breach in that solid, moving mass of horses and of steel. Quickly\nthe breach is repaired: the ranks close up again! This is a parade! a\nreview! The eyes of France are upon her sons! and \"Vive l'Empereur!\"\n\nStill they come!\n\nVolley after volley from the British guns makes deadly havoc among those\nglistering ranks!\n\nBut nevertheless they come!\n\nNo halt save for the quick closing up into serried, orderly columns. And\nthen on with the advance!--like the surging up of a tidal wave against\nthe cliffs--on with the advance! up the slopes toward the crest where\nthose who are in the front ranks are mowed down by the British\nguns--their places taken by others from the rear--those others mowed\ndown again, and again replaced--falling in their hundreds as they reach\nthe crest, like the surf that shivers and dies as it strikes against the\ncliffs.\n\nNey's horse is killed under him--the fifth to-day--but he quickly\nextricates himself from saddle and stirrups and continues on his way--on\nfoot, sword in hand--the sword that conquered at Austerlitz, at Eylau\nand at Moskowa. Round him the grenadiers of the Old Guard--they with\nthe fur bonnets and the grizzled moustaches--tighten up their ranks.\n\nThey advance behind the cavalry! and after every volley from the British\nguns they shout loudly: \"Vive l'Empereur!\"\n\nAnd anon the tidal wave--despite the ebb, despite the constant breaking\nof its surf--has by sheer force of weight hurled itself upon the crest\nof the plateau.\n\nThe Brunswickers on the left are scattered. Cleeves and Lloyd have been\nforced to abandon their guns: the British artillery is silenced and the\nchasseurs of Michel hold the extreme edge of the upland, and turn a\ndeadly fusillade upon Colin Halkett's brigade already attacked by\nMilhaud and his guards and now severely shaken.\n\n\"See the English General!\" cries Duchaud to his cuirassiers, \"he is\nbetween two fires. He cannot escape.\"\n\nNo! he cannot but he seizes the colours of the 33rd whose young\nlieutenant has just fallen, and who threaten to yield under the\ndevastating cross-fire: he brandishes the tattered colours, high up\nabove his head--as high as he can hold them--he calls to his men to\nrally, and then falls grievously wounded.\n\nBut his guards have rallied. They stand firm now, and Duchaud, chewing\nhis grey moustache, murmurs his appreciation of so gallant a foe.\n\n\"That side will win,\" he mutters, \"who can best keep on killing.\"\n\n\nIV\n\n\"Up, guards, and at them!\"\n\nMaitland's brigade of guards had been crouching in the\ncorn--crouching--waiting for the order to charge--red-coated lions in\nthe ripening corn--ready to spring at the word.\n\nAnd Death the harvester in chief stands by with his scythe ready for the\nmowing.\n\n\"Up, guards, and at them!\"\n\nIt is Maitland and his gallant brigade of guards--out of the corn they\nrise and front the three battalions of Michel's chasseurs who were the\nfirst to reach the highest point of the hill. They fire and Death with\nhis scythe has laid three hundred low. The tricolour flag is riddled\nwith grapeshot and G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Michel has fallen.\n\nThen indeed the mighty wave of steel can advance no longer: for it is\nconfronted with an impenetrable wall--a wall of living, palpitating,\nheroic men--men who for hours have stood their ground and fought for the\nhonour of Britain and of her flag--men who with set teeth and grim\ndetermination were ready to sell their lives dearly if lives were to be\nsold--men in fact who have had their orders to hold out to the last man\nand who are going to obey those orders now.\n\n\"Up, guards, and at them,\" and surprised, bewildered, staggered, the\nchasseurs pause: three hundred of their comrades lie dead or dying on\nthe ground. They pause: their ranks are broken: with his last dying sigh\nbrave G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Michel tries to rally them. But he breathes his last ere\nhe succeeds: his second in command loses his head. He should have\nordered a bayonet charge--sudden, swift and sure--against that red wall\nthat rushes at them with such staggering power: but he too tries to\nrally his men, to reform their ranks--how can they re-form as for parade\nunder the deadly fire of the British guards?\n\nConfusion begins its deathly sway: the chasseurs--under conflicting\norders--stand for full ten minutes almost motionless under that\ndevastating fire.\n\nAnd far away on the heights of Frischemont the first line of Prussian\nbayonets are seen silhouetted against the sunset sky.\n\nWellington has seen it. Bl\u00c3\u00bccher has come at last! One final effort, one\nmore mighty gigantic, superhuman struggle and the glorious end would be\nin sight. He gives the order for a general charge.\n\n\"Forward, boys,\" cries Colonel Saltoun to his brigade. \"Now is the\ntime!\"\n\nHeads down the British charge. The chasseurs are already scattered, but\nbehind the chasseurs, fronting Maitland's brigade, fronting Adam and his\nartillery, fronting Saltoun and Colborne the Fire-Eater, the Old Guard\nis seen to advance, the Old Guard who through twelve campaigns and an\nhundred victories have shown the world how to conquer and how to die.\n\nWhen Michel's chasseurs were scattered, when their General fell; when\nthe English lines, exhausted and shaken for a moment, rallied at\nWellington's call: \"Up, guards, and at them!\" when from far away on the\nheights of Frischemont the first line of Prussian bayonets were\nsilhouetted against the sunset sky, then did Napoleon's old growlers\nwith their fur bonnets and their grizzled moustaches enter the line of\naction to face the English guards. They were facing Death and knew it\nbut still they cried: \"Vive l'Empereur!\"\n\nHeads down the British charge, whilst from Ohain comes the roar of\nBl\u00c3\u00bccher's guns, and up from the east, Zieten with the Prussians rushes\nup to join in the assault.\n\nThen the carnage begins: for the Old Guard is still advancing--in solid\nsquares--solemn, unmoved, magnificent: the bronze eagles on their\nbonnets catch the golden rays of the setting sun. Thus they advance in\nface of deadly fire: they fall like corn before the scythe. A sublime\nsuicide to the cry of \"Vive l'Empereur!\" and not one of the brigade is\nmissing except those who are dead.\n\nThey know--none better--that this is the beginning of the end. Perhaps\nthey do not care to live if their Emperor is to be Emperor no longer,\nif he is to be sent back to exile--to the prison of Elba or worse: and\nso they advance in serried squares, while Maitland's artillery has\nattacked them in the rear. Great gaps are made in those ranks, but they\nare quickly filled up again: the squares become less solid, smaller, but\nthey remain compact. Still they advance.\n\nBut now close behind them Bl\u00c3\u00bccher's guns begin to thunder and Zieten's\ncolumns are rapidly gaining ground: all round their fur bonnets a\nhailstorm of grape-shot is raging whilst Adam's artillery is in action\nwithin fifty paces at their flank. But the old growlers who had suffered\ndeath with silent fortitude in the snows of Russia, who had been as\ngrand in their defeat at Moscow and at Leipzic as they had been in the\ntriumphs of Auerstadt or of Friedland--they neither staggered nor paused\nin their advance. On they went--carrying their muskets on their\nshoulders--a cloud of tirailleurs in front of them, right into the\ncross-fire of the British guns: their loud cry of \"Vive l'Empereur\"\ndrowning that other awesome, terrible cry which someone had raised a\nwhile ago and which now went from mouth to mouth: \"We are betrayed!\n_Sauve qui peut!_\"\n\nThe Prussians were in their rear; the British were charging their front,\nand panic had seized the most brilliant cavalry the world had ever seen.\n\n\"Sauve qui peut\" is echoed now and re-echoed all along the crest of the\nplateau. And the echo rolls down the slope into the valley where\nReille's infantry and a regiment of cuirassiers, and three more\nbattalions of chasseurs, are making ready to second the assault on Mont\nSaint Jean. Reille and his infantry pause and listen: the cuirassiers\nhalt in their upward movement, whilst up on the ridge of the plateau\nwhere Donzelot's grenadiers have attacked the brigade of Kempt and\nLambert and Pack, the whisper goes from mouth to mouth:\n\n\"We are betrayed! _Sauve qui peut!_\"\n\nPanic seizes the younger men: they turn their horses' heads back toward\nthe slopes. The stampede has commenced: very soon it grows. The British\nin front, the Prussians in the rear: \"Sauve qui peut!\"\n\nNey amongst them is almost unrecognisable. His face is coal-black with\npowder: he has no hat, no epaulettes and only half a sword: rage,\nanguish, bitterness are in his husky voice as he adjures, entreats,\ncalls to the demoralised army--and insults it, execrates it in turn. But\nnothing but Death will stop that army now in its headlong flight.\n\n\"At least stop and see how a Marshal of France dies on the field of\nhonour,\" he calls.\n\nBut the voice which led these same men to victory at Moskowa has lost\nits potency and its magic. The men cry \"Vive Ney!\" but they do not\nstand. The stampede has become general. In the valley below the infantry\nhas started to run up the slope of La Belle Alliance: after it the\ncavalry with reins hanging loose, stirrups lost, casques, sabretaches,\nmuskets--anything that impedes--thrown into the fields to right and\nleft. La Haye Sainte is evacuated, Hougoumont is abandoned; Papelotte,\nPlancenoit, the woods, the plains are only filled with running men and\nthe thunder of galloping chargers.\n\n\nAlone the Old Guard has remained unshaken. Whilst all around them what\nwas once the Grand Army is shattered, destroyed, melted like ice before\na devastating fire, they have continued to advance, sublime in their\nfortitude, in their endurance, their contempt for death. One by one\ntheir columns are shattered and there are none now to replace those that\nfall. And as the gloom of night settles on this vast hecatomb on the\nplateau of Mont Saint Jean the conquerors of Jena and Austerlitz and\nFriedland make their last stand round the bronze eagle--all that is left\nto them of the glories of the past.\n\nAnd when from far away the cry of \"Sauve qui peut\" has become only an\necho, and the bronze eagle shattered by a bullet lies prone upon the\nground shielded against capture in its fall by a circling mountain of\ndead, when finally Night wraps all the heroism, the glory, the sorrow\nand the horrors of this awful day in the sable folds of her\nall-embracing mantle, Napoleon's Old Guard has ceased to be.\n\n\nAnd out in the western sky a streak of vivid crimson like human blood\nhas broken the bosom of the clouds: the glow of the sinking sun rests on\nthis huge dissolution of what was once so glorious and unconquered and\ngreat. Then it is that Wellington rides to the very edge of the plateau\nand fronts the gallant British troops at this supreme hour of oncoming\nvictory, and lifting his hat high above his head he waves it three times\nin the air.\n\nAnd from right and left they come, British, Hanoverians, Belgians and\nBrunswickers to deliver the final blow to this retreating army, wounded\nalready unto death.\n\nThey charge now: they charge all of them, cavalry, infantry, gunners,\nforty thousand men who have forgotten exhaustion, forgotten what they\nhave suffered, forgotten what they had endured. On they come with a rush\nlike a torrent let loose; the confusion of sounds and sights becomes a\npandemonium of hideousness, bugles and drums and trumpets and bagpipes\nall mingle, merge and die away in the fast gathering twilight.\n\nAnd the tidal wave of steel recedes down the slopes of Mont Saint Jean,\ninto the valley and thence up again on Belle Alliance, with a m\u00c3\u00aal\u00c3\u00a9e of\nsounds like the breaking of a gigantic line of surf against the\nirresistible cliffs, or the last drawn-out sigh of agony of dying giants\nin primeval times.\n\n\nV\n\nOn the road to Genappe in the mystery of the moonlit night a solitary\nrider turned into a field and dismounted.\n\nCarried along for a time by the stream of the panic, he found himself\nfor a moment comparatively alone--left as it were high and dry by the\nsame stream which here had divided and flowed on to right and left of\nhim. He wore a grey redingote and a shabby bicorne hat.\n\nHaving dismounted he slipped the bridle over his arm and started to walk\nbeside his horse back toward Waterloo.\n\nA sleep-walker in pursuit of his dream!\n\nHeavy banks of grey clouds chased one another with mad fury across the\nmidsummer sky, now obscuring the cold face of the moon, now allowing her\npale, silvery rays to light up this gigantic panorama of desolation and\nterror and misery. To right and left along the roads and lanes, across\ngrassland and cornfields, canals, ditches and fences the last of the\nGrand Army was flying headlong, closely pursued by the Prussians. And at\nthe farm of La Belle Alliance Wellington and Bl\u00c3\u00bccher had met and shaken\nhands, and had thanked God for the great and glorious victory.\n\nBut the sleep-walker went on in pursuit of his dream--he walked with\nmeasured steps beside his weary horse, his eyes fixed on the horizon far\naway, where the dull crimson glow of smouldering fires threw its last\nweird light upon this vast abode of the dead and the dying. He walked\non--slowly and mechanically back to the scene of the overwhelming\ncataclysm where all his hopes lay irretrievably buried. He walked\non--majestic as he had never been before, in the brilliant throne-room\nof the Tuileries or the mystic vastness of Notre Dame when the Imperial\ncrown sat so ill upon his plebeian head. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. He walked on--silent,\nexalted and great--great through the magnitude of his downfall.\n\nAnd to right and left of him, like the surf that recedes on a pebbly\nbeach, the last of his once invincible army was flying back to\nFrance--back in the wake of those who had been lucky enough to fly\nbefore--bodies of men who had been the last to realise that an heroic\nstand round a fallen eagle could no longer win back that which was lost,\nand that if life be precious it could only be had in flight--bits of\nhuman wreckage too, forgotten by the tide--they all rolled and rushed\nand swept past the silent wayfarer .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. quite close at times: so close\nthat every man could see him quite distinctly, could easily distinguish\nby the light of the moon the grey redingote and the battered hat which\nthey all knew so well--which they had been wont to see in the forefront\nof an hundred victorious charges.\n\nNow half-blinded by despair and by panic they gazed with uncomprehending\neyes on the man and on the horse and merely shouted to him as they\nrushed galloping or running by, \"The Prussians are on us! _Sauve qui\npeut!_\"\n\nAnd the dreamer still looked on that distant crimson glow and in the\nbosom of those wind-swept clouds he saw the pictures of Austerlitz and\nJena and Wagram, pictures of glory and might and victory, and the shouts\nwhich he heard were the ringing cheers round the bivouac fires of long\nago.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE LAST THROW\n\n\nI\n\nIt was close on half-past nine and the moon full up on the stormy sky\nwhen a couple of riders detached themselves out of the surging mass of\nhorses and men that were flying pell-mell towards Genappe, and slightly\nchecking their horses, put them to a slower gallop and finally to a\ntrot.\n\nOn their right a small cottage gleamed snow-white in the cold, searching\nlight of the moon. A low wall ran to right and left of it and enclosed a\nsmall yard at the back of the cottage; the wall had a gate in it which\ngave on the fields beyond. At the moment that the two riders trotting\nslowly down the road reached the first angle of the wall, the gate was\nopen and a man leading a white horse and wearing a grey redingote turned\ninto the yard.\n\n\"My God! the Emperor!\" exclaimed one of the riders as he drew rein.\n\nThey both turned their horses into the field, skirting the low,\nenclosing wall until they reached the gate. The white horse was now\ntethered to a post and the man in the grey redingote was standing in the\ndoorway at the rear of the cottage. The two men dismounted and in their\nturn led their horses into the yard: at sight of them the man in the\ngrey redingote seemed to wake from his sleep.\n\n\"Berthier,\" he said slowly, \"is that you?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sire,--and Colonel Bertrand is here too.\"\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"We earnestly beg you, Sire, to come with us to Genappe. There is not\nthe slightest hope of rallying any portion of your army now. The\nPrussians are on us. You might fall into their hands.\"\n\nBerthier--conqueror and Prince of Wagram--spoke very earnestly and with\nhead uncovered, but more abruptly and harshly than he had been wont to\ndo of yore in the salons of the Tuileries or on the glory-crowned\nbattlefields at the close of a victorious day.\n\n\"I am coming! I am coming!\" said the Emperor with a quick sigh of\nimpatience. \"I only wanted to be alone a moment--to think things out--to\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"There is nothing quite so urgent, Sire, as your safety,\" retorted the\nPrince of Wagram drily.\n\nThe Emperor did not--or did not choose to--heed his great Marshal's\nmarked want of deference. Perhaps he was accustomed to the moods of\nthese men whom his bounty had fed and loaded with wealth and dignities\nand titles in the days of his glory, and who had proved only too ready,\nalas!--even last year, even now--to desert him when disaster was in\nsight.\n\nWithout another word he turned on his heel and pushing open the cottage\ndoor he disappeared into the darkness of the tiny room beyond. With an\nimpatient shrug of the shoulders Berthier prepared to follow him.\nColonel Bertrand busied himself with tethering the horses, then he too\nfollowed Berthier into the building.\n\nIt was deserted, of course, as all isolated cottages and houses had been\nin the vicinity of Quatre Bras or Mont Saint Jean. Bertrand struck a\ntinder and lighted a tallow candle that stood forlorn on a deal table in\nthe centre of the room. The flickering light revealed a tiny cottage\nkitchen--hastily abandoned but scrupulously clean--white-washed walls, a\nred-tiled floor, the iron hearth, the painted dresser decorated with\nwhite crockery, shiny tin pans hung in rows against the walls and two\nor three rush chairs. Napoleon sat down.\n\n\"I again entreat you, Sire--\" began Berthier more earnestly than before.\n\nBut the Emperor was staring straight out before him, with eyes that\napparently saw something beyond that rough white wall opposite, on which\nthe flickering candle-light threw such weird gargantuan shadows. The\nprecious minutes sped on: minutes wherein death or capture strode with\ngiant steps across the fields of Flanders to this lonely cottage where\nthe once mightiest ruler in Europe sat dreaming of what might have been.\nThe silence of the night was broken by the thunder of flying horses'\nhoofs, by the cries of \"Sauve qui peut!\" and distant volleys of\nartillery proclaiming from far away that Death had not finished all his\nwork yet.\n\nBertrand and Berthier stood by, with heads uncovered: silent, moody and\nanxious.\n\nSuddenly the dreamer roused himself for a moment and spoke abruptly and\nwith his usual peremptory impatience: \"De Marmont,\" he said. \"Has either\nof you seen him?\"\n\n\"Not lately, Sire,\" replied Colonel Bertrand, \"not since five o'clock at\nany rate.\"\n\n\"What was he doing then?\"\n\n\"He was riding furiously in the direction of Nivelles. I shouted to him.\nHe told me that he was making for Brussels by a circuitous way.\"\n\n\"Ah! that is right! Well done, my brave de Marmont! Braver than your\ntreacherous kinsman ever was! So you saw him, did you, Bertrand? Did he\ntell you that he had just come from Genappe?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sire, he did,\" replied Bertrand moodily. \"He told me that by your\norders he had sent a messenger from there to Paris with news of your\nvictory: and that by to-morrow morning the capital would be ringing\nwith enthusiasm and with cheers.\"\n\n\"And by the time de Marmont came back from Genappe,\" interposed the\nPrince of Wagram with a sneer, \"the plains of Waterloo were ringing with\nthe Grand Army's '_Sauve qui peut!_'\"\n\n\"An episode, Prince, only an episode!\" said Napoleon with an angry frown\nof impatience. \"To hear you now one would imagine that Essling had never\nbeen. We have been beaten back, of course, but for the moment the world\ndoes not know that. Paris to-morrow will be be-flagged and the bells of\nNotre Dame will send forth their joyous peals to cheer the hearts of my\npeople. And in Brussels this afternoon thousands of our\nenemies--Belgians, Dutch, Hanoverians, Brunswickers--were rushing\nhelter-skelter into the town--demoralised and disorganised after that\nbrilliant charge of our cuirassiers against the Allied left.\"\n\n\"Would to God the British had been among them too,\" murmured old Colonel\nBertrand. \"But for their stand .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"And a splendid stand it was. Ah! but for that. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. To think that if\nGrouchy had kept the Prussians away, in only another hour we .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nThe dreamer paused in his dream of the might have been: then he\ncontinued more calmly:\n\n\"But I was not thinking of that just now. I was thinking of those who\nfled to Brussels this afternoon with the news of our victory and of\nWellington's defeat.\"\n\n\"Even then the truth is known in Brussels by now,\" protested Berthier.\n\n\"Yes! but not before de Marmont has had the time and the pluck to save\nus and our Empire! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Berthier,\" he continued more vehemently, \"don't\nstand there so gloomy, man .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and you, too, my old Bertrand. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nSurely, surely you have realised that at this terrible juncture we must\nutilise every circumstance which is in our favour. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. That early\nnews of our victory .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. we can make use of that. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. A big throw in\nthis mighty game, but we can do it .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Berthier, do you see how we can\ndo it .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0?\"\n\n\"No, Sire, I confess that I do not,\" replied the Marshal gloomily.\n\n\"You do not see?\" retorted the Emperor with a frown of angry impatience.\n\"De Marmont did--at once--but he is young--and enthusiastic, whereas\nyou. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. But don't you see that the news of Wellington's defeat must\nhave enormous consequences on the money markets of the world--if only\nfor a few hours? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. It must send the prices on the foreign Bourses\ntumbling about people's ears and create an absolute panic on the London\nStock Exchange. Only for a few hours of course .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but do you not see\nthat if any man is wise enough to buy stock in London during that panic\nhe can make a fortune by re-selling the moment the truth is known?\"\n\n\"Even then, Sire,\" stammered Berthier, a little confused by this\navalanche of seemingly irrelevant facts hurled at him at a moment when\nthe whole map of Europe was being changed by destiny and her future\ntrembled in the hands of God.\n\n\"Ah, de Marmont saw it all .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. at once .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" continued the Emperor\nearnestly, \"he saw eye to eye with me. He knows that money--a great deal\nof money--is just what I want now .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. money to reorganise my army, to\nre-equip and reform it. The Chamber and my Ministers will never give me\nwhat I want. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. My God! they are such cowards! and some of them would\nrather see the foreign troops again in Paris than Napoleon Emperor at\nthe Tuileries. You should know that, Mar\u00c3\u00a9chal, and you, too, my good\nBertrand. De Marmont knows it .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. that is why he rode to Brussels at\nthe hour when I alone knew that all was lost at Waterloo, but when half\nEurope still thought that the Corsican ogre had conquered again. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nDe Marmont is in Brussels now .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. to-night he crosses over to\nEngland--to-morrow morning he and his broker will be in the Stock\nExchange in London--calm, silent, watchful. An operation on the Bourse,\nwhat? like hundreds that have been done before .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but in this case\nthe object will be to turn one million into fifty so that with it I\nmight rebuild my Empire again.\"\n\nHe spoke with absolute conviction, and with indomitable fervour, sitting\nhere quietly, he--the architect of the mightiest empire of modern\ndays--just as he used to do in the camps at Austerlitz and Jena and\nWagram and Friedland--with one clenched hand resting upon the rough deal\ntable, the flickering light of the tallow candle illuminating the wide\nbrow, the heavy jaw, those piercing eyes that still gazed--in this hour\nof supreme catastrophe--into a glorious future destined never to\nbe--scheming, planning, scheming still, even while his Grand Army was\nmelting into nothingness all around him, and distant volleys of musketry\nwere busy consummating the final annihilation of the Empire which he had\ncreated and still hoped to rebuild.\n\nBerthier gave a quick sign of impatience.\n\nRebuild an Empire, ye gods!--an Empire!--when the flower of its manhood\nlies pale and stark like the windrows of corn after the harvester has\ndone his work. Thoughts of a dreamer! Schemes of a visionary! How will\nthe quaking lips which throughout the length and breadth of this vast\nhecatomb now cry, \"Sauve qui peut!\" how will they ever intone again the\nold \"Vive l'Empereur!\"\n\nThe conqueror of Wagram gave a bitter sigh and faithful Bertrand hung\nhis head gloomily; but de Marmont had neither sighed nor doubted: but\nthen de Marmont was young--he too was a dreamer, and an enthusiast and a\nvisionary. His idol in his eyes had never had feet of clay. For him the\nstricken man was his Emperor still--the architect, the creator, the\ninvincible conqueror--checked for a moment in his glorious work, but\nable at his will to rebuild the Empire of France again on the very ruins\nthat smouldered now on the fields of Waterloo.\n\n\"I can do it, Sire,\" he had cried exultantly, when his Emperor first\nexpounded his great, new scheme to him. \"I can be in Brussels in an\nhour, and catch the midnight packet for England at Ostend. At dawn I\nshall be in London, and by ten o'clock at my post. I know a financier--a\nJew, and a mightily clever one--he will operate for me. I have a million\nor two francs invested in England, we'll use these for our operations!\nMoney, Sire! You shall have millions! Our differences on the Stock\nExchange will equip the finest army that even you have ever had! Fifty\nmillions? I'll bring you a hundred! God has not yet decreed the downfall\nof the Empire of France!\"\n\nSo de Marmont had spoken this afternoon in the enthusiasm of his youth\nand of his hero-worship: and since then the great dreamer had continued\nto weave his dreams! Nothing was lost, nothing could be lost whilst\nenthusiasm such as that survived in the hearts of the young.\n\nAnd still wrapped in his dream he sat on, while danger and death and\ndisgrace threatened him on every side. Berthier and Bertrand entreated\nin vain, in vain tried to drag him away from this solitary place, where\nany moment a party of Prussians might find and capture him.\n\nUnceremoniously the Prince of Wagram had blown out the flickering light\nthat might have attracted the attention of the pursuers. It was a very\nelementary precaution, the only one he or Bertrand was able to take. The\nhorses were out in the yard for anyone to see, and the greatest spoil of\nvictory might at any moment fall into the hands of the meanest Prussian\nsoldier out for loot.\n\nBut the dreamer still sat on in the gloom, with the pale light of the\nmoon streaming in through the narrow casement window and illumining that\nmarble-like face, rigid and set, that seemed only to live by the\nglowing eyes--the eyes that looked into the future and the past and\nheeded not the awful present.\n\nClose on a quarter of an hour went by until at last he jumped to his\nfeet, with the sudden cry of \"To Genappe!\"\n\nBerthier heaved a sigh of relief and Bertrand hurried out to unfasten\nthe horses.\n\n\"You are impatient, Prince,\" said the Emperor almost gaily, as he strode\nwith a firm step to the door. \"You are afraid those cursed Prussians\nwill put the Corsican ogre into a cage and send him at once to His\nVictorious Bourbon Majesty King Louis XVIII. Not so, my good Berthier,\nnot so. The Star of my Destiny has not yet declined. I've done all the\nthinking I wanted to do. Now we'll to Genappe, where we'll rally the\nremnants of our army and then quietly await de Marmont's return with the\nmillions which we want. After that we'll boldly on to Paris and defy my\nenemies there .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. En avant, Mar\u00c3\u00a9chal! the Corsican ogre is not in the\niron cage yet!\"\n\nOutside Bertrand was holding his stirrup for him. He swung himself\nlightly in the saddle and turned out of the farmyard gate into the open,\nthrowing back his head and sniffing the storm-laden air as if he was\nabout to lead his army to one of his victorious charges. Not waiting to\nsee how close the other two men followed him, he put his horse at once\nat a gallop.\n\nHe rode on--never pausing--never looking round even on that gigantic\ndesolation which the cold light of the moon weirdly and fitfully\nrevealed--his mind was fixed upon a fresh throw on the gaming table of\nthe world.\n\nOverhead the storm-driven clouds chased one another with unflagging fury\nacross the moonlit sky, now obscuring, now revealing that gigantic\ndissolution of the Grand Army, so like the melting of ice and frost\nunder the fierce kiss of the sun.\n\nMore than men in an attack, less than women in a retreat, the finest\ncavalry Europe had ever seen was flying like sand before the wind: but\nthe somnambulist rode on in his sleep, forgetting that on these vast and\nbillowing fields twenty-six thousand gallant French heroes had died for\nthe sake of his dreams.\n\nBertrand and the Prince of Wagram followed--gloomy and silent--they knew\nthat all suggestions would be useless, all saner advice remain unheeded.\nBesides, de Marmont had gone, and after all, what did it all matter?\nWhat did anything matter, now that Empire, glory, hope, everything were\nirretrievably lost?\n\nAnd in faithful Bertrand's deep-set eyes there came a strange, far-off\nlook, almost of premonition, as if in his mind he could already see that\nlonely island rock in the Atlantic, and the great gambler there, eating\nout his heart with vain and bitter regrets.\n\n\nII\n\nBut de Marmont had never had any doubts, never any forebodings: he only\nhad boundless faith in his hero and boundless enthusiasm for his cause.\nAccustomed to handle money since early manhood, owner of a vast fortune\nwhich he had administered himself with no mean skill, he had no doubt\nthat the Emperor's scheme for manufacturing a few millions in a wild\ngamble on the Stock Exchange was not only feasible but certain of\nsuccess.\n\nUndoubtedly the false news of Wellington's defeat would reach London\nto-morrow, as it had already reached Paris and Brussels. The panic in\nthe money market was a foregone conclusion: the quick rise in prices\nwhen the truth became known was equally certain. It only meant\nforestalling the arrival of Wellington's despatches in London by four\nand twenty hours, and one million would make fifty during that time.\n\nAs de Marmont had told his Emperor, he had several hundred thousand\npounds invested in England, on which he could lay his hands: operations\non the Bourse were nothing new to him: and already while he was still\nlistening with respect and enthusiasm to his Emperor's instructions, he\nwas longing to get away. He knew the country well between here and\nBrussels, and he was wildly longing to be at work, to be flying across\nthe low-lying land, on to Brussels and then across to England in the\nwake of the awful news of complete disaster.\n\nHe would steal the uniform of some poor dead wretch--a Belgium or a\nHanoverian or a black Brunswicker, he didn't care which--it wouldn't\ntake long to strip the dead, and the greatness of the work at stake\nwould justify the sacrilege. In the uniform of one of the Allied army he\ncould safely continue his journey to Brussels, and with luck could reach\nthe city long before sunset.\n\nIn Brussels he would at once obtain civilian clothes and then catch the\nevening packet for England at Ostend. Oh, no! it was not likely that\nWellington could send a messenger over to London quite so soon!\n\nAt this hour--it was just past five--he was still on Mont Saint Jean\nmaking another desperate stand against the Imperial cavalry with troops\nhalf worn out with discouragement and whose endurance must even now be\ngiving way.\n\nAt this hour the Prussians had appeared at Braine L'Alleud, they had\nengaged Reille at Plancenoit, but Wellington and the British had still\nto hold their ground or the news which de Marmont intended to accompany\nto London might prove true after all.\n\nYe gods, if only that were possible! How gladly would Victor then have\nlost the hundred thousands which he meant to risk to-morrow! Wellington\nreally vanquished before Bl\u00c3\u00bccher could come to his rescue! Napoleon\nonce more victorious, as he had always been, and a mightier monarch\nthan before! Then he, Victor de Marmont, the faithful young enthusiast\nwho had never ceased to believe when others wavered, who at this last\nhour--when the whole world seemed to crumble away from under the feet of\nthe man who had once been its master--was still ready to serve his\nEmperor, never doubting, always hoping, he would reap such a reward as\nmust at last dazzle the one woman who could make that reward for him\ndoubly precious.\n\nVictor de Marmont had effected the gruesome exchange. He was now dressed\nin the black uniform of a Brunswick regiment wherein so many French\nroyalists were serving. By a wide d\u00c3\u00a9tour he had reached the approach to\nBrussels. Indeed it seemed as if the news which he had sent flying to\nParis was true after all. Behind the forest of Soigne where he now was,\nthe fields and roads were full of running men and galloping horses. The\ndull green of Belgian uniforms, the yellow facings of the Dutch, the\nblack of Brunswickers, all mingled together in a moving kaleidoscopic\nmass of colour: men were flying unpursued yet panic-stricken towards\nBrussels, carrying tidings of an awful disaster to the allied armies in\ntheir haggard faces, their quivering lips, their blood-stained tunics.\n\nDe Marmont joined in with them: though his heart was full of hope, he\ntoo contrived to look pale and spent and panic-stricken at will--he\nheard the shouts of terror, the hastily murmured \"All is lost! even the\nBritish can no longer stand!\" as horses maddened with fright bore their\nhalf-senseless riders by. He set his teeth and rode on. His dark eyes\nglowed with satisfaction; there was no fear that the great gambler would\nstake his last in vain: the news would travel quick enough--as news of\ndisaster always will. Brussels even now must be full of weeping women\nand children, as it soon would be of terror-driven men, of wounded and\nof maimed crawling into the shelter of the town to die in peace.\n\nAnd as he rode, de Marmont thought more and more of Crystal. The last\nthree months had only enhanced his passionate love for her and his\nmaddening desire to win her yet at all costs. St. Genis would of course\nbe fighting to-day. Perchance a convenient shot would put him\neffectively out of the way. De Marmont had vainly tried in this wild\ngallopade to distinguish his rival's face among this mass of foreigners.\n\nAs for the Englishman! Well! no doubt he had disappeared long ago out of\nCrystal de Cambray's life. De Marmont had never feared him greatly. That\none look of understanding between Crystal and Clyffurde, and the\nlatter's strange conduct about the money at the inn, were alone\nresponsible for the few twinges of jealousy which de Marmont had\nexperienced in that quarter.\n\nIndeed, the Englishman was a negligible quantity. De Marmont did not\nfear him. There was only St. Genis, and with the royalist cause rendered\nabsolutely hopeless--as it would be, as it _must_ be--St. Genis and the\nComte de Cambray and all those stiff-necked aristocrats of the old\nregime who had thought fit to turn their proud backs on him at Brestalou\nthree months ago, would be irretrievably ruined and discredited and\nwould have to fly the country once more .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and Crystal, faced with\nthe alternative of penury in England or a brilliant existence at the\nTuileries as the wife of the Emperor's most faithful friend, would make\nher choice as he--de Marmont--never doubted that any woman would.\n\nHope for him had already become reality. Brussels was the half-way halt\nto the uttermost heights of his ambition. Fortune, the Emperor's\ngratitude, the woman he loved, all waited for him there. He reached the\ncity just as that distant horizon in the west was lit up by a streak of\nbrilliant crimson from the fast sinking sun: just when--had he but\nknown it!--on the crest of Mont Saint Jean, Wellington had waved his hat\nover his head and given the heroic British army--exhausted, but\nundaunted--the order for a general charge; just when the Grand Army,\nfinally checked in its advance, had first set up the ominous call that\nwas like the passing-bell of its dying glory: \"Sauve qui peut!\"\n\n\nIII\n\n\"Sauve qui peut!\"\n\nBobby Clyffurde heard the cry too through the fast gathering shadows of\nunconsciousness that closed in round his wearied senses, and, as a film\nthat was so like the kindly veil of approaching Death spread over his\neyes, he raised them up just once to that vivid crimson glow far out in\nthe west, and on the winged chariot of the setting sun he sent up his\nlast sigh of gratitude to God. All day he had called for Death--all day\nhe had wooed her there where bullets and grape-shot were thickest--where\nher huge scythe had been most busily at work.\n\nSons of fond mothers, husbands, sweethearts that were dearly loved,\nbrothers that would be endlessly mourned, lives that were more precious\nthan any earthly treasures--the ghostly harvester claimed them all with\nimpartial cruelty. And he--desolate and lonely--with no one greatly to\ncare if he came back or no--with not a single golden thread of hope to\nwhich he might cling, without a dream to brighten the coming days of\ndreariness--with a life in the future that could hold nothing but vain\nregrets, Bobby had sought Death twenty times to-day and Death had\nresolutely passed him by.\n\nBut now he was grateful for that: he was thankful that he had lived just\nlong enough to see the sunset, just long enough to take part in that\nlast glorious charge in obedience to Wellington's inspiring command:\n\"Up, guards, and at them!\" he was glad to have lived just long enough\nto hear the \"Sauve qui peut!\" to know that the Grand Army was in full\nretreat, that Bl\u00c3\u00bccher had come up in time, that British pluck and\nBritish endurance had won the greatest victory of all times for\nBritain's flag and her national existence.\n\nNow with a rough bandage hastily tied round his head where grape-shot\nhad lacerated cheek and ear, with a bayonet thrust in the thigh and\nanother in the arm, Bobby had remained lying there with many thousands\nround him as silent, as uncomplaining, as he--in the down-trodden\ncorn--and with the tramp of thousands of galloping, fleeing horses, the\nclash of steel and fusillade of tirailleurs and artillery reaching his\ndimmed senses like a distant echo from the land of ghosts. And before\nhis eyes--half veiled in unconsciousness, there flitted the tender,\ndelicate vision of Crystal de Cambray: of her blue eyes and soft fair\nhair, done up in a quaint mass of tiny curls; of the scarf of filmy lace\nwhich she always liked to wrap round her shoulders, and through the lace\nthe pearly sheen of her skin, of her arms, and of her throat. The air\naround him had become pure and rarified: that horrible stench of powder\nand smoke and blood no longer struck his nostrils--it was roses, roses\nall around him--crimson roses--sweet and caressing and fragrant--with\nsoft, velvety petals that brushed against his cheek--and from somewhere\nclose by came a dreamy melody, the half-sad, half-gay lilt of an\nintoxicating dance.\n\nIt was delicious! and Bobby, wearied, sore and aching in body, felt his\nsoul lifted to some exquisite heights which were not yet heaven, of\ncourse, but which must of a truth form the very threshold of Paradise.\n\nHe saw Crystal more and more clearly every moment: now he was looking\nstraight into her blue eyes, and her little hand, cool and white as\nsnow, rested upon his burning forehead. She smiled on him--as on a\nfriend--there was no contempt, no harshness in her look--only a great,\nconsoling pity and something that seemed like an appeal!\n\nYes! the longer he himself looked into those blue eyes of hers, the more\nsure he was that there was an appeal in them. It almost seemed as if she\nneeded him, in a way that she had never needed him before. Apparently\nshe could not speak: she could not tell him what it was she wanted: but\nher little hands seemed to draw him up, out of the trodden, trampled\ncorn, and having soothed his aches and pains they seemed to impel him to\ndo something--that was important .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and imperative .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. something\nthat she wanted done.\n\nHe begged her to let him lie here in peace, for he was now comforted and\nhappy. He was quite sure now that he was dead, that her sweet face had\nbeen the last tangible vision which he had seen on earth, ere he closed\nhis eyes in the last long sleep.\n\n\nHe had seen her and she had gone. All of a sudden she had vanished, and\ndarkness was closing in around him: the scent of roses faded into the\nair, which was now filled again with horrid sounds--the deafening roar\nof cannon, the sharp and incessant retort of rifle-fire, the awesome\nm\u00c3\u00aal\u00c3\u00a9e of cries and groans and bugle-calls and sighs of agony, and one\ndeafening cry--so like the last wail of departing souls--which came from\nsomewhere--not very far away: \"Vive l'Empereur!\"\n\nBobby raised himself to a sitting posture. His head ached terribly--he\nwas stiff in every limb: a burning, almost intolerable pain gnawed at\nhis thigh and at his left arm. But consciousness had returned and with\nit all the knowledge of what this day had meant: all round him there was\nthe broken corn, stained with blood and mud, all round him lay the dead\nand the dying in their thousands. Far away in the west a crimson glow\nlike fire lit up this vast hecatomb of brave lives sacrificed, this\nfinal agony of the vast Empire, the might and grandeur of one man laid\nlow this day by the mightier hand of God.\n\nIt lit up with the weird light of the dying day the pallid, clean-shaven\nfaces of gallant British boys, the rugged faces of the Scot, the olive\nskin of the child of Provence, the bronzed cheeks of old veterans: it\nthrew its lurid glow on red coats and black coats, white facings and\ngilt epaulettes; it drew sparks as of still-living fire from\nbreastplates and broken swords, discarded casques and bayonets,\nsabretaches and kilts and bugles and drums, and dead horses and arms and\naccoutrements and dead and dying men, all lying pell-mell in a huge\nlitter with the glow of midsummer sunset upon them--poor little\nchessmen--pawns and knights--castles of strength and kings of some\nlonely mourning hearts--all swept together by the Almighty hand of the\nGreat Master of this terrestrial game.\n\nBut with returning consciousness Bobby's gaze took in a wider range of\nvision. He visualised exactly where he was--on the south slope of Mont\nSaint Jean with La Haye Sainte on ahead a little to his left, and the\nwhitewashed walls of La Belle Alliance still further away gleaming\ngolden in the light of the setting sun.\n\nHe saw that on the wide road which leads to Genappe and Charleroi the\nonce invincible cavalry of the mighty Emperor was fleeing helter-skelter\nfrom the scene of its disaster: he saw that the British--what was left\nof them--were in hot pursuit! He saw from far Plancenoit the\nscintillating casques of Bl\u00c3\u00bccher's Prussians.\n\nAnd on the left a detachment of allied troops--Dutch, Belgian,\nBrunswickers--had just started down the slope of the plateau to join in\nthis death-dealing pell-mell, where amongst the litter of dead and\ndying, in the confusion of pursuer and pursued, comrade fought at times\nagainst comrade, brother fired on brother--Prussian against British.\n\nDown below behind the farm buildings of La Haye Sainte two battalions of\nchasseurs of the Old Guard had made a stand around a tattered bit of\ntricolour and the bronze eagle--symbol of so much decadent grandeur and\nof such undying glory. \"A moi chasseurs,\" brave G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Pelet had cried.\n\"Let us save the eagle or die beneath its wing.\"\n\nAnd those who heard this last call of despair stopped in their headlong\nflight; they forged a way for themselves through the mass of running\nhorses and men, they rallied to their flag, and with their\ntirailleurs--kneeling on one knee--ranged in a circle round them, they\nnow formed a living bulwark for their eagle, of dauntless breasts and\nbristling bayonets.\n\nAnd upon this mass of desperate men, the small body of raw Dutch and\nBelgian and German troops now hurled themselves with wild huzzas and\nblind impetuousness. Against this mass of heroes and of conquerors in a\ndozen victorious campaigns--men who had no longer anything to lose but\nlife, and to whom life meant less than nothing now--against them a\nhandful of half-trained recruits, drunk with the cry of \"Victory\" which\ndrowned the roar of the cannon and the clash of sabres, drunk with the\nvision of glory which awaited them if that defiant eagle were brought to\nearth by them!\n\nAnd as Bobby staggered to his feet he already saw the impending\ncatastrophe--one of the many on this day of cumulative disasters. He saw\nthe Dutch and the Belgians and the Brunswickers rush wildly to the\ncharge--young men--enthusiasts--brave--but men whose ranks had twice\nbeen broken to-day--who twice had rallied to their colours and then had\nbroken again--men who were exhausted--men who were none too ably\nled--men in fact--and there were many French royalists among their\nofficers--who had not the physical power of endurance which had enabled\nthe British to astonish the world to-day.\n\nBobby could see amongst them the Brunswickers and their black coats--he\nwould have known them amongst millions of men. The full brilliance of\nthe evening glow was upon them--on their black coats and the silver\ngaloons and tassels; two of their officers had made a brave show in\nBrussels three days--or was it a hundred years?--ago at the Duchess of\nRichmond's ball. Bobby remembered them so well, for one of these two\nofficers was Maurice de St. Genis.\n\nOh! how Crystal would love to see him now--even though her dear heart\nwould be torn with anxiety for him--for he was fighting bravely, bravely\nand desperately as every one had fought to-day, as these chasseurs of\nthe Old Guard--just the few of them that remained--were fighting still\neven at this hour round that tattered flag and that bronze eagle, and\nwith the cry of \"Vive l'Empereur!\" dying upon their lips.\n\nDespair indeed on both sides--even at this hour when the merest incident\nmight yet turn the issue of this world-conflict one way or the other.\nBobby, as he steadied himself on his feet, had seen that the attack was\nalready turning into a rout. Not only had Pelet's chasseurs held the\nDutch and Brunswickers at bay, not only had their tirailleurs made\ndeadly havoc among their assailants, but the latter now were threatened\nwith absolute annihilation even whilst all around them their\nallies--British and Prussian--were crying \"Victory!\"\n\nBobby could see them quite clearly--for he saw with that subtle and\ndelicate sense which only a great and pure passion can give!--he saw the\ndanger at the very moment when it was born--at the precise instant when\nit threatened that handful of black-coated men, one of whose officers\nwas named St. Genis. He saw the first sign of wavering, of stupefaction,\nthat followed the impetuous charge: he saw the gaps in the ranks after\nthat initial deadly volley from the tirailleurs. It almost seemed as if\nhe could hear those shouts of \"Vive l'Empereur!\" and the rallying cry of\ncommanding officers--it was all so near--not more than three hundred\nyards away, and the clear, stormy atmosphere carried sights and sounds\nupon its wing.\n\nAnother volley from the tirailleurs and the Dutch and Brunswickers\nturned to fly: in vain did their officers call, they wanted to get away!\nThey tried to fly--to run, for now the chasseurs were at them with\nbayonets--they tried to run, but the ground was littered with their own\nwounded and dead--with the wounded and the dead of a long day of\ncarnage: they stumbled at every step--fell over the dying and the\nwounded--over dead and wounded horses--over piles of guns and swords and\nbayonets, and sabretaches, over forsaken guns and broken carriages,\nlitter that impeded them in front even as they were driven with the\nbayonet from the rear.\n\nBobby saw it all, for they were coming now--pursued and pursuers--as\nfast as ever they could; they were coming, these flying, black-coated\nmen, casting away their gay trappings as well as their arms, trying to\nrun--to get away--but stumbling, falling all the time--picking\nthemselves up, falling and running again.\n\nAnd in that one short moment while the whole brief tragedy was enacted\nbefore his eyes, Bobby also saw, in a vision that was equally swift and\nfleeting, the blue eyes of Crystal drowned in tears. He saw her with\nfair head drooping like a lily, he saw the quiver of her lips, heard the\nmoan of pain that would come to her lips when the man she loved was\nbrought home to her--dead. And in that same second--so full of\nportent--Bobby understood why it was that her sweet image had called to\nhim for help just now. Again she called, again she beckoned--her blue\neyes looked on him with an appeal that was all-compelling: her two dear\nhands were clasped and she begged of him that he should be her friend.\n\nSuch visions come from God! no man sees them save he whose soul is great\nand whose heart is pure. Poor Bobby Clyffurde--lonely, heart-broken,\ndesolate--saw the exquisite face that he would have loved to kiss--he\nsaw it with the golden glow of evening upon the delicate cheeks, and\nwith the lurid light of fire and battle upon the soft, fair hair.\n\nAnd the greatness of his love helped him to understand what life still\nheld for him--the happiness of supreme sacrifice.\n\nAll around him was death, but there was some life too: one or two poor,\nabandoned riderless horses were quietly picking bits of corn from\nbetween the piles of dead and dying men, or were standing, sniffing the\nair with dilated nostrils, and snorting with terror at the deafening\nnoise. Bobby had steadied himself, neither his head nor his limbs were\naching now--at any rate he had forgotten them--all that he remembered\nwas what he saw, those black-coated Brunswickers who longed to fly and\ncould not and who were being slaughtered like insects even as they\nstumbled and fled.\n\nAnd Bobby caught the bridle of one of these poor, terror-stricken beasts\nthat stood snorting and sniffing not far away: he crawled up into the\nsaddle, for his thigh was numb and one of his arms helpless. But once on\nhorseback he could get along--over trampled corn and over the dead--on\ntoward that hideous corner behind the farm of La Haye Sainte where\ndesperate men were butchering others that were more desperate than\nthey--in among that seething crowd of black coats and fur bonnets, of\nsilver tassels and of brass eagles, into a whirlpool of swords and\nbayonets and gun-fire from the tirailleurs--for there he had seen the\nman whom Crystal loved--for whose sake she would eat out her heart with\nmourning and regret.\n\nIn the deafening noise of shrieking and sighs and whizzing bullets and\ncries of agony he heard Crystal's voice telling him what to do. Already\nhe had seen St. Genis struggling on his knees not fifty m\u00c3\u00a8tres away from\nthe first line of tirailleurs, not a hundred from the advancing steel\nwall of fixed bayonets. Maurice had thrown back his head, in the\nhopelessness of his despair; the evening sun fell full upon his haggard,\nblood-stained face, upon his wide-open eyes filled with the terror of\ndeath. The next moment Bobby Clyffurde was by his side; all around him\nbullets were whizzing--all around him men sighed their last sigh of\nagony. He stooped over his saddle: \"Can you pull yourself up?\" he\ncalled. And with his one sound arm he caught Maurice by the elbow and\nhelped him to struggle to his feet. The horse, dazed with terror,\nsnorted at the smell of blood, but he did not move. Maurice, equally\ndazed, scrambled into the saddle--almost inert--a dead weight--a thing\nthat impeded progress and movement; but the thing that Crystal loved\nabove all things on earth and which Bobby knew he must wrest out of\nthese devouring jaws of Death and lay--safe and sound--within the\nshelter of her arms.\n\n\nIV\n\nAfter that it meant a struggle--not for his own life, for indeed he\ncared little enough for that--but for the sake of the burden which he\nwas carrying--a burden of infinite preciousness since Crystal's heart\nand happiness were bound up with it.\n\nMaurice de St. Genis clung half inert to him with one hand gripping the\nsaddle-bow, the other clutching Bobby's belt with convulsive tenacity.\nBobby himself was only half conscious, dazed with the pain of wounds,\nthe exertion of hoisting that dead weight across his saddle, the\ndeafening noise of whizzing bullets round him, the boring of the\nfrightened horse against its bridle, as it tried to pick its way through\nthe tangled heaps upon the ground.\n\nBut every moment lessened the danger from stray bullets, and the chance\nof the bayonet charge from behind. The cries of \"Vive l'Empereur!\" round\nthat still standing eagle were drowned in the medley and confusion of\nhundreds of other sounds. Bobby was just able to guide his horse away\nfrom the spots where the fighting was most hot and fierce, where\nVivian's hussars attacked those two battalions of cuirassiers, where\nAdam's brigade of artillery turned the flank of the chasseurs and laid\nthe proud bronze eagle low, where Ney and the Old Guard were showing to\nthe rest of the Grand Army how grizzled veterans fought and died.\n\nHe rode straight up the plateau, however, but well to the right now,\npicking his way carefully with that blind instinct which the tracked\nbeast possesses and which the hunted man sometimes receives from God.\n\nThe dead and the dying were less thick here upon the ground. It was here\nthat earlier in the day the Dutch and the Belgians and the Brunswickers\nhad supported the British left, during those terrific cavalry charges\nwhich British endurance and tenacity had alone been able to withstand.\nIt was here that Hacke's Cumberland Hussars had broken their ranks and\nfled, taking to Brussels and thence to Ghent the news of terrific\ndisaster. Bobby's lips were tight set and he snorted like a war-horse\nwhen he thought of that--when he thought of the misery and sorrow that\nmust be reigning in Brussels now--and of the consternation at Ghent\nwhere the poor old Bourbon King was probably mourning his dead hopes and\nhis vanished throne.\n\nIn Brussels women would be weeping; and Crystal--forlorn and\ndesolate--would perhaps be sitting at her window watching the stream of\nfugitives that came in--wounded and exhausted--from the field of battle,\nrecounting tales of a catastrophe which had no parallel in modern times:\nand Crystal, seeing and hearing this, would think of the man she loved,\nand believing him to be dead would break her heart with sorrow.\n\nAnd when Bobby thought of that he was spurred to fresh effort, and he\npulled himself together with a desperate tension of every nerve and\nsinew, fighting exhaustion, ignoring pain, conjuring up the vision of\nCrystal's blue eyes and her pleading look as she begged him to save her\nfrom lifelong sorrow and the anguish of future loneliness. Then he no\nlonger heard the weird and incessant cannonade, he no longer saw the\ndesolation of this utter confusion around him, he no longer felt\nexhausted, or the weight of that lifeless, impeding burden upon his\nsaddle-bow.\n\nStray bands of fugitives with pursuers hot on their heels passed him by,\nstray bullets flew to right and left of him, whizzing by with their\neerie, whistling sound; he was now on the outskirts of the great\npursuit--anon he reached the crest of Mont Saint Jean at last, and\nalmost blindly struck back eastward in the direction of the forest of\nSoigne.\n\nIt was blind instinct--and nothing more--that kept him on his horse: he\nclung to his saddle with half-paralysed knees, just as a drowning man\nwill clutch a floating bit of wreckage that helps him to keep his head\nabove the water. The stately trees of Soigne were not far ahead now:\nthrough the forest any track that bore to the left would strike the\nBrussels road; only a little more strength--another effort or two--the\ncool solitude of the wood would ease the weight of the burden and the\nthrobbing of nerves and brain. The setting sun shone full upon the leafy\nedge of the wood; hazelnut and beech and oak and clumps of briar rose\nquivered under the rough kiss of the wind that blew straight across the\nlowland from the southwest, bringing with it still the confusion of\nsounds--the weird cannonades and dismal bugle-calls--in such strange\ncontrast to the rustle of the leaves and the crackling of tiny twigs in\nthe tangled coppice.\n\nHow cool and delicious it must be under those trees--and there was a\nnarrow track which must lead straight to the Brussels road--the ground\nlooked soft and mossy and damp after the rain--oh! for the strength to\nreach those leafy shadows, to plunge under that thicket and brush with\nburning forehead against those soft green leaves heavy with moisture!\nOh! for the power to annihilate this distance of a few hundred yards\nthat lie between this immense graveyard open to wind and scorching sun,\nand the green, cool moss and carpet of twigs and leaves and soft,\nsweet-smelling earth, on which a weary body and desolate soul might find\neternal rest! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\n\n\nV\n\nOn! on! through the forest of Soigne! There was no question as yet of\nrest.\n\nMaurice had not yet wakened from his trance. Bobby vaguely wondered if\nhe were not already dead. There was no stain of blood upon his fine\nuniform, but it was just possible that in stumbling, running and falling\nhe had hit his head or received a blow which had deprived him of\nconsciousness directly after he had scrambled into the saddle.\n\nBobby remembered how pale and haggard he had looked and how his hand had\nby the merest instinct clutched at the saddle-bow, and then had dropped\naway from it--helpless and inert. Now he lay quite still with his head\nresting against Bobby's shoulder.\n\nUnder the trees it was cool and the air was sweet and soothing: Bobby\nwith his left hand contrived to tear a handful of leaves from the\ncoppice as he passed: they were full of moisture and he pressed them\nagainst Maurice's lips and against his own.\n\nThe forest was full of sounds: of running men and horses, the rattle of\nwheels, and the calls of terror and of pain, with still and always that\nawesome background of persistent cannonade. But Bobby heard nothing, saw\nnothing save the narrow track in front of him, along which the horse now\nambled leisurely, and from time to time--when he looked down--the pale,\nhaggard face of the man whom Crystal loved.\n\nAt one moment Maurice opened his eyes and murmured feebly: \"Where am I?\"\n\n\"On the way to Brussels,\" Bobby contrived to reply.\n\nA little later on horse and rider emerged out of the wood and the\nBrussels road stretched out its long straight ribbon before Bobby\nClyffurde's dull, uncomprehending gaze.\n\nClose by at his feet the milestone marked the last six kilom\u00c3\u00a8tres to\nBrussels. Only another half-dozen kilom\u00c3\u00a8tres--only another hour's ride\nat most! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Only!!! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. when even now he felt that the next few\nminutes must see him tumbling head-foremost from the saddle.\n\nFar away beyond the milestone on his right--in a meadow, the boundary of\nwhich touched the edge of the wood--women were busy tossing hay after\nthe rain, all unconscious of the simple little tragedy that was being\nenacted so close to them: their cotton dresses and the kerchiefs round\ntheir heads stood out as trenchant, vivid notes of colour against the\ndull grey landscape beyond. A couple of haycarts were standing by:\nbeside them two men were lighting their pipes. The wind was playing with\nthe hay as the women tossed it, and their shrill laughter came echoing\nacross the meadow.\n\nAnd even now the ground was shaken with the repercussion of distant\nvolleys of artillery, and along the road a stream of men were running\ntoward Brussels, horses galloped by frightened and riderless, or\ndragging broken gun-carriages behind them in the mud. The whole of that\nstream was carrying the news of Wellington's disaster to Brussels and to\nGhent: not knowing that behind them had already sounded the passing bell\nfor the Empire of France.\n\nBobby had drawn rein on the edge of the wood to give his horse a rest,\nand for a while he watched that running stream, longing to shout to them\nto turn back--there was no occasion to run--to see what had been done,\nto take a share in that glorious, final charge for victory. But his\nthroat was too parched for a shout, and as he watched, he saw in among a\nknot of mounted men--fugitives like the others, pale of face, anxious of\nmien and with that intent look which men have when life is precious and\nhas got to be saved--he saw a man in the same uniform that St. Genis\nwore--a Brunswicker in black coat and silver galoons--who stared at him,\npersistently and strangely, as he rode by.\n\nThe face though much altered by three days' growth of beard, and by the\nset of the shako worn right down to the brows, was nevertheless a\nfamiliar one. Bobby--stupefied, deprived for the moment of thinking\npowers, through sheer exhaustion and burning pain--taxed his weary brain\nin vain to understand the look of recognition which the man in the black\nuniform cast upon him as he passed.\n\nUntil a lightly spoken: \"Hullo, my dear Clyffurde!\" uttered gaily as the\nrider drew near to the edge of the road, brought the name of \"Victor de\nMarmont!\" to Bobby's quivering lips.\n\nAnd just for the space of sixty seconds Fate rubbed her gaunt hands\ncomplacently together, seeing that she had brought these three men\ntogether--here on this spot--three men who loved the same woman, each\nwith the utmost ardour and passion at his command--each even at this\nvery moment striving to win her and to work for her happiness.\n\nBehind them in the plains of Waterloo the cannon still was roaring: de\nMarmont was on his way to redeem the fallen fortunes of the hero whom he\nworshipped and to win imperial regard, imperial favours, fortune and\nglory wherewith to conquer a girl's obstinacy. St. Genis--pale and\nunconscious--seemed even in his unconsciousness to defy the power of any\nrival by the might of early love, of old associations, of similarity of\ncaste and of political ideals. He had fought for the cause which she and\nhe had both equally at heart and by his very helplessness now he seemed\nto prove that he could do no more than he had done and that he had the\nright to claim the solace and comfort which her girlish lips and her\ngirlish love had promised him long ago.\n\nWhilst Bobby had nothing to promise and nothing to give save\ndevotion--his hope, his desire and his love were bounded by her\nhappiness. And since her happiness lay in the life of the man whom he\nhad dragged out of the jaws of Death, what greater proof could he give\nof his love than to lay down his life for him and for her?\n\nDe Marmont's keen eyes took in the situation at a glance: he threw a\nquick look of savage hatred on St. Genis and cast one of contemptuous\npity on Clyffurde. Then with a shrug of the shoulders and a light,\ntriumphant laugh, he set spurs to his horse and rode swiftly away.\n\nBobby's lack-lustre eyes followed horse and rider down the road till\nthey grew smaller and smaller still and finally disappeared in the\ndistance. For a moment he felt puzzled. What was de Marmont doing in\nthis stream of senseless, panic-stricken men? What was he doing in the\nuniform of one of the Allied nations? Why had he laughed so gaily and\nappeared so triumphant in his mien?\n\nDid he not know then that his hero had fallen along with his mighty\neagle? that the brief adventure begun in the gulf of Jouan had ended in\na hopeless tragedy on the field of Waterloo? But why that uniform? Poor\nBobby's head ached too much to allow him to think, and time was getting\non.\n\nThe road now was deserted. The last of the fugitives formed but a cloud\nof black specks on the line of the horizon far off toward Brussels. From\nthe hayfield there came the merry sound of women's laughter, while far\naway cannon and musketry still roared. And over the long, straight\nroad--bordered with straight poplar trees--the setting sun threw\never-lengthening shadows.\n\nMaurice opened his eyes.\n\n\"Where am I?\" he asked again.\n\n\"Close to Brussels now,\" replied Bobby.\n\n\"To Brussels?\" murmured St. Genis feebly. \"Crystal!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" assented Bobby. \"Crystal! God bless her!\" Then as St. Genis was\ntrying to move, he added: \"Can you shift a little?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" replied the other.\n\n\"If you could ease the pressure on my leg .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. steady, now! steady!\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Can you sit up in the saddle? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Are you hurt? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Not much. My head aches terribly. I must have hit it against something.\nBut that is all. I am only dizzy and sick.\"\n\n\"Could you ride on to Brussels alone, think you?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"It is not far. The horse is very quiet. He will amble along if you give\nhim his head.\"\n\n\"But you?\"\n\n\"I'd like to rest. I'll find shelter in a cottage perhaps .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. or in\nthe wood.\"\n\nSt. Genis said nothing more for the moment. He was intent on sliding\ndown from the saddle without too much assistance from Bobby. When he had\nreached the ground, it took him a little while to collect himself, for\nhis head was swimming: he closed his eyes and put out a hand to steady\nhimself against a tree.\n\nWhen Maurice opened his eyes again, Bobby was sitting on the ground by\nthe roadside: the horse was nibbling a clump of fresh, green grass.\n\nFor the first time since that awful moment when stumbling and falling\nagainst a pile of dead, with Death behind and all around him, he had\nheard the welcome call: \"Can you pull yourself up?\" and felt the\nsteadying grip upon his elbow--Maurice de St. Genis looked upon the man\nto whom he owed his life.\n\nWith that stained bandage round his head, dulled and bloodshot eyes,\nface blackened with powder and smoke and features drawn and haggard,\nBobby Clyffurde was indeed almost unrecognisable. But Maurice knew him\non the instant. Hitherto, he had not thought of how he had come out of\nthat terrible hell-fire behind La Haye Sainte--indeed, he had quickly\nlost consciousness and never regained it till now: and now he knew that\nthe same man who in the narrow hotel room near Lyons had ungrudgingly\nrendered him a signal service--had risked his life to-day for\nhis--Maurice's sake.\n\nNo one could have entered that awful m\u00c3\u00aal\u00c3\u00a9e and faced the bayonet charge\nof Pelet's cuirassiers and the hail of bullets from their tirailleurs\nwithout taking imminent risk of death. Yet Clyffurde had done it. Why?\nMaurice--wide-eyed and sullen--could only find one answer to that\ninsistent question.\n\nThat same deadly pang of jealousy which had assailed his heart after the\nmidnight interview at the inn now held him in its cruel grip again. He\nfelt that he hated the man to whom he owed his life, and that he hated\nhimself for this mean and base ingratitude. He would not trust himself\nto speak or to look on Bobby at all, lest the ugly thoughts which were\nfloating through his mind set their stamp upon his face.\n\n\"Will you ride on to Brussels?\" he said at last. \"I can wait here .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nand perhaps you could send a conveyance for me later on. M. le Comte de\nCambray would .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"M. le Comte de Cambray and Mademoiselle Crystal are even now devoured\nwith anxiety about you,\" broke in Clyffurde as firmly as he could. \"And\nI could not ride to Brussels--even though some one were waiting for me\nthere--I really am not able to ride further. I would prefer to sit here\nand rest.\"\n\n\"I don't like to leave you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. after .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. after what you have done\nfor me .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I would like to .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"I would like you to scramble into that saddle and go,\" retorted Bobby\nwith a momentary return to his usual good-natured irony, \"and to leave\nme in peace.\"\n\n\"I'll send out a conveyance for you,\" rejoined St. Genis. \"I know M. le\nComte de Cambray would wish .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Mention my name to M. le Comte at your peril .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" began Clyffurde.\n\n\"But .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"By the Lord, man,\" now exclaimed Bobby with a sudden burst of energy,\n\"if you do not go, I vow that sick as I am, and sick though you may be,\nI'll yet manage to punch your aching head.\"\n\nThen as the other--still reluctantly--turned to take hold of the horse's\nbridle, he added more gently: \"Can you mount?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! I am better now.\"\n\n\"You won't turn giddy, and fall off your horse?\"\n\n\"I don't think so.\"\n\n\"Talk about the halt leading the blind!\" murmured Clyffurde as he\nstretched himself out once more upon the soft ground, whilst Maurice\ncontrived to hoist himself up into the saddle. \"Are you safe now?\" he\nadded as the young man collected the reins in his hand, and planted his\nfeet firmly into the stirrups.\n\n\"Yes! I am safe enough,\" replied St. Genis. \"It is only my head that\naches: and Brussels is not far.\"\n\nThen he paused a moment ere he started to go--with lips set tight and\nlooking down on Bobby, whose pale face had taken on an ashen hue:\n\n\"How you must despise me,\" he said bitterly.\n\nBut Bobby made no reply: he was just longing to be left alone, whilst\nthe other still seemed inclined to linger.\n\n\"Would to God,\" Maurice said with a sigh, \"that M. le Comte heard the\nevil news from other lips than mine.\"\n\n\"Evil news?\" And Bobby, whom semi-consciousness was already taking off\nonce more to the land of visions and of dreams--was brought back to\nreality--as if with a sudden jerk--with those two preposterous little\nwords.\n\n\"What evil news?\" he asked.\n\n\"The allied armies have retreated all along the line .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. the Corsican\nadventurer is victorious .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. our poor King .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, you young fool,\" cried Bobby hoarsely. \"The Lord help\nyou but I do believe you are about to blaspheme .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"But .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"The Allied Armies--the British Army, God bless it!--have covered\nthemselves with glory--Napoleon and his Empire have ceased to be. The\nGrand Army is in full retreat .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. the Prussians are in pursuit. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nThe British have won the day by their pluck and their endurance. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nThank God I lived just long enough to see it all, ere I fell .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"But when we charged the cuirassiers .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" began St. Genis, not knowing\nreally if Bobby was raving in delirium, or speaking of what he knew. He\nwanted to ask further questions, to hear something more before he\nstarted for Brussels .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. the only thing which he remembered with\nabsolute certainty was that awful charge of his regiment against the\ncuirassiers, then the panic and the rout: and he judged the whole issue\nof the battle by what had happened to a detachment of Brunswickers.\n\nAnd yet, of course--before the charge--he had seen and known all that\nBobby told him now. That rush of the Brunswickers and the Dutch down the\nhillside was only a part of the huge and glorious charge of the whole of\nthe Allied troops against the routed Grand Army of Napoleon. He had\nneither the physical strength nor the desire to think out all that it\nwould mean to him personally if what Bobby now told him was indeed\nabsolutely true.\n\nHe was longing to make the wounded man rouse himself just once more and\nreiterate the glad news which meant so much to him--Maurice--and to\nCrystal. But it was useless to think of that now. Bobby was either\nunconscious or asleep. For a moment a twinge of real pity made St.\nGenis' heart ache for the man who seemed to be left so lonely and so\ndesolate: jealousy itself gave way before that more gentle feeling.\nAfter all, Crystal could only be true to the love of her childhood; her\nheart belonged to the companion, the lover, the ideal of her girlish\ndreams. This stranger here loved her--that was obvious--but Crystal had\nnever looked on him with anything but indifference. Even that dance last\nnight .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but of this Maurice would not think lest pity die out of his\nheart again .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and jealousy and hate walk hand in hand with base\ningratitude.\n\nHe turned his horse's head round to the road, pressed his knees into its\nsides, and then as the poor, weary beast started to amble leisurely down\nthe road, Maurice looked back for the last time on the prostrate,\npathetic figure of the lonely man who had given his all for him: he\nlooked at every landmark which would enable him to find that man\nagain--the angle of the forest where it touched the meadow,--the\nmilestone, the trees by the roadside--oh! he meant to do his duty, to do\nit well and quickly, to send the conveyance, to neglect nothing; then,\nwith a sigh--half of bitterness, yet full of satisfaction--he finally\nturned away and looked straight out before him into the distance where\nBrussels lay, and where the happiness of Crystal's love called to him,\nand he would find rest and peace in the warm affection of her faithful\nheart.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE LOSING HANDS\n\n\nI\n\nAn hour later Maurice de St. Genis was in Brussels. Though his head\nstill ached his mind was clear, and thoughts of Crystal--of happiness\nwith her now at last within sight--had chased every other thought away.\n\nHis home had been with the de Cambrays ever since those old, sad days in\nEngland; he had a home to go to now:--a home where the kindly friendship\nof the Comte as well as the love of Crystal was ready to welcome him.\nThe warmth of anticipated happiness and well-being warmed his heart and\ngave strength to his body. The horrors of the past few hours seemed all\nto have melted away behind him on the Brussels road as did the\nremembrance of a man--wounded himself and spent--risking his life for\nthe sake of a friend. Not that St. Genis meant to be ungrateful--nor did\nhe forget that wounded man--lying alone and sick on the fringe of the\nwood by the roadside.\n\nAs soon as he had taken his horse round to the barracks in the rue des\nCom\u00c3\u00a9diens, and before even he had a wash or had his uniform cleaned of\nstains and mud, he rushed to the headquarters of the Army Service to see\nhow soon a conveyance could be sent out to his friend--and when he was\nunable to obtain what he wanted there, he rushed from hospital to\nhospital, thence to two or three doctors whom he knew of to see what\ncould be done. But the hospitals were already over-full and over-busy:\ntheir ambulances were all already on the way: as for the doctors, they\nwere all from home--all at work where their skill was most needed--an\narmy of doctors, of ambulances and drivers would not suffice at this\nhour to bring all the wounded in from the spot where that awful battle\nwas raging.\n\nAnd Maurice saw time slipping by: he had already spent an hour in a\nfruitless quest. He longed to see Crystal and waxed impatient at the\ndelay. Anon at the English hospital a kindly person--who listened\nsympathetically to his tale--promised him that the ambulance which was\njust setting out in the direction of Mont Saint Jean would be on the\nlook-out for his wounded friend by the roadside; and Maurice with a sigh\nof relief felt that he had indeed done his duty and done his best.\n\nAt the English hospital Clyffurde would be splendidly looked\nafter--nowhere else could he find such sympathetic treatment! And\nMaurice with a light heart went back to the barracks in the rue des\nCom\u00c3\u00a9diens, where he had a wash and had his uniform cleaned. Somewhat\nrefreshed, though still very tired, he hurried round to the rue du\nMarais, where the Comte de Cambray had his lodgings. The first sight of\nBrussels had already told him the whole pitiable tale of panic and of\ndesolation which had filled the city in the wake of the fugitive troops.\nThe streets were encumbered with vehicles of every kind--carts,\nbarouches, barrows--with horses loosely tethered, with the wounded who\nlay about on litters of straw along the edges of the pavement, in\ndoorways, under archways in the centre of open places, with crowds of\nweeping women and crying children wandering aimlessly from place to\nplace trying to find the loved one who might be lying here, hurt or\nmayhap dying.\n\nAnd everywhere men in tattered uniforms, with grimy hands and faces, and\nboots knee-deep in stains of mud, stood about or sat in the empty\ncarts, talking, gesticulating, giving sundry, confused and contradictory\naccounts of the great battle--describing Napoleon's decisive\nvictory--Wellington's rout--the prolonged absence of Bl\u00c3\u00bccher and the\nPrussians, cause of the terrible disaster.\n\nM. le Comte d'Artois had rushed precipitately from Brussels up to Ghent\nto warn His Majesty the King of France that all hope of saving his\nthrone was now at an end, and that the wisest course to pursue was to\nreturn to England and resign himself once more to obscurity and exile.\n\nM. le Prince de Cond\u00c3\u00a9 too had gone off to Antwerp in a huge barouche,\nhaving under his care the treasure and jewels of the crown hastily\ncollected three months ago at the Tuileries.\n\nIn every open space a number of prisoners were being guarded by mixed\npatrols of Dutch, Belgian or German soldiers, and their cry of \"Vive\nl'Empereur!\" which they reiterated with unshakable obstinacy roused the\nire of their captors, and provoked many a savage blow, and many a broken\nhead.\n\nBut St. Genis did not pause to look on these sights: he had not the\nstrength to stand up in the midst of these confused masses of\nterror-driven men and women, and to shout to them that they were\nfools--that all their panic must be turned to joy, their lamentations to\nshouts of jubilation. News of victory was bound to spread through the\ncity within the next hour, and he himself longed only to see Crystal, to\nreassure her as to his own safety, to see the light of happiness kindled\nin her eyes by the news which he brought. He had not the strength for\nmore.\n\nIt was old Jeanne who opened the door at the lodgings in the rue du\nMarais when Maurice finally rang the bell there.\n\n\"M. le Marquis!\" she exclaimed. \"Oh! but you are ill.\"\n\n\"Only very tired and weak, Jeanne,\" he said. \"It has been an awful day.\"\n\n\"Ah! but M. le Comte will be pleased!\"\n\n\"And Mademoiselle Crystal?\" asked Maurice with a smile which had in it\nall the self-confidence of the accepted lover.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Crystal will be happy too,\" said Jeanne. \"She has been so\nunhappy, so desperately anxious all day.\"\n\n\"Can I see her?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle is out for the moment, M. le Marquis. And M. le Comte has\ngone to the Cercle des L\u00c3\u00a9gitimistes in the rue des Cendres--perhaps M.\nle Marquis knows--it is not far.\"\n\n\"I would like to see Mademoiselle Crystal first. You understand, don't\nyou, Jeanne?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do, M. le Marquis,\" sighed faithful Jeanne, who was always\ninclined to be sentimental.\n\n\"How long will she be, do you think?\"\n\n\"Oh! another half hour. Perhaps more. Mademoiselle has gone to the\ncathedral. If M. le Marquis will give himself the trouble to walk so\nfar, he cannot fail to see Mademoiselle when she comes out of church.\"\n\nBut already--before Jeanne had finished speaking--Maurice had turned on\nhis heel and was speeding back down the narrow street. Tired and weak as\nhe was, his one idea was to see Crystal, to hear her voice, to see the\nlove-light in her eyes. He felt that at sight of her all fatigue would\nbe gone, all recollections of the horrors of this day wiped out with the\nfirst look of joy and relief with which she would greet him.\n\n\nII\n\nThe service was over, and the congregation had filed out of the\ncathedral. Crystal was one of the last to go. She stood for a long while\nin the porch looking down with unseeing eyes on the bustle and\nexcitement which went on in the Place down below. Her mind was not\nhere. It was far indeed from the crowd of terror-stricken or gossiping\nmen and women, of wounded soldiers, terrified peasantry and anxious\ntownsfolk that encumbered the precincts of the stately edifice.\n\nFrom the remote distance--out toward the south--came the boom and roar\nof cannon and musket fire--almost incessant still. There was her heart!\nthere her thoughts! with the brave men who were fighting for their\nnational existence--with the British troops and with their\nsufferings--and she stood here, staring straight out before\nher--dry-eyed and pale and small white hands clasped tightly together.\n\nThe greater part of to-day she had sat by the open window in the shabby\ndrawing-room in the rue du Marais, listening to that awful fusillade,\nwondering with mind well-nigh bursting with horror and with misery which\nof those cruel shots which she heard in the dim distance would still for\never the brave and loyal heart that had made so many silent sacrifices\nfor her.\n\nAnd her father, vaguely thinking that she was anxious about\nMaurice--vaguely wondering that she cared so much--had done his best to\ntry and comfort her: \"She need not fear much for Maurice,\" he had told\nher as reassuringly as he could--\"the Brunswickers were not likely to\nsuffer much. The brunt of the conflict would fall upon the British. Ah!\nbut they would lose very heavily. Wellington had not more than seventy\nthousand men to put up against the Corsican's troops; and only a hundred\nand fifty cannon against two hundred and eighty. Yes, the British would\nprobably be annihilated by superior forces: but no doubt the other\nallies--and the Brunswickers--would come off a great deal better.\"\n\nBut Mme. la Duchesse douairi\u00c3\u00a8re d'Agen offered no such consolation. She\ncontented herself with saying that she was sure in her mind that\nMaurice would come through quite safely, and that she prayed to God with\nall her heart and soul that the gallant British troops would not suffer\ntoo heavily. Then with her fine, gentle hand she patted Crystal's fair\ncurls which were clinging matted and damp against the young girl's\nburning forehead. And she stooped and kissed those aching dry blue eyes\nand whispered quite under her breath so that Crystal could not be sure\nif she heard correctly: \"May God protect him too! He is a brave and a\ngood man!\"\n\nAnd then Crystal had gone out to seek peace and rest in beautiful old\nSte. Gudule, so full of memories of other conflicts, other prayers,\nother deeds of heroism of long ago. Here in the dim light and the\nsilence and the peace, her quivering nerves had become somewhat stilled:\nand when she came out she was able just for the moment neither to see or\nhear the terror-mongers down below and only to think of the heroes out\nthere on the field of battle for whom she had just prayed with such\npassionate earnestness.\n\nSuddenly in the crowd she recognised Maurice. He was coming up the\ncathedral steps, looking for her, no doubt--Jeanne must have directed\nhim. When he drew near to her, he saw that a look of happy surprise and\nof true joy lit up the delicate pathos of her face. He ran quickly to\nher now. He would have taken her in his arms--here in face of the\ncrowd--but there was something in her manner which instinctively sobered\nhim and he had to be content with the little cold hands which she held\nout to him and with imprinting a kiss upon her finger tips.\n\nAlready in his eyes she had read that the news which he brought was not\nso bad as rumour had foretold.\n\n\"Maurice,\" she cried excitedly, with a little catch in her throat, \"you\nare well and safe, thank God! And what news? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"The news is good,\" Maurice replied. \"Victory is assured by now. It has\nbeen a hard day, but we have won.\"\n\nShe said nothing for a moment. But the tears gathered in her eyes, her\nlips quivered and Maurice knew that she was thanking God. Then she\nturned back to him and he could see her face glowing with excitement.\n\n\"And our allies,\" she asked, and now that little catch in her throat was\nmore marked, \"the British troops? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. We heard that they behaved like\nheroes, and bore the brunt of this awful battle.\"\n\n\"I don't know much about the British troops, my sweet,\" he replied\nlightly, \"but what news I have I will have to impart to your father as\nwell as to you. So it will have to keep until I see him .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but just\nnow, Crystal, while we are alone .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I have other things to say to\nyou.\"\n\nBut it is doubtful if Crystal heard more than just the first words which\nhe had spoken, for she broke in quite irrelevantly:\n\n\"You don't know about the British troops, Maurice? Oh! but you must\nknow! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Don't you know what British regiments were engaged? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"I know that none of our own people were in British regiments, Crystal,\"\nhe retorted somewhat drily, \"whereas the Brunswickers and Nassauers were\nas much French as German .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. they fought gallantly all day .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you\ndo not ask so much about them.\"\n\n\"But .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" she stammered while a hot flush spread over her cheeks, \"I\nthought .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you said .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Are you not content for the moment, Crystal,\" he called out with tender\nreproach, \"to know that victory has crowned our King and his allies and\nthat I have come back to you safely out of that raging hell at Waterloo?\nAre you not glad that I am here?\"\n\nHe spoke more vehemently now, for there was something in Crystal's calm\nattitude which had begun to chill him. Had he not been in deadly danger\nall the day? Had she not heard that distant cannon's roar which had\nthreatened his life throughout all these hours? Had he not come back out\nof the very jaws of Death?\n\nAnd yet here she stood white as a lily and as unruffled; except for that\none first exclamation of joy not a single cry from the heart had forced\nitself through her pale, slightly trembling lips: yet she was sweet and\ngirlish and tender as of old and even now at the implied reproach her\neyes had quickly filled with tears.\n\n\"How can you ask, Maurice?\" she protested gently. \"I have thought of you\nand prayed for you all day.\"\n\nIt was her quiet serenity that disconcerted him--the kindly tone of her\nvoice--her calm, unembarrassed manner checked his passionate impulse and\ncaused him to bite his underlip with vexation until it bled.\n\nThe shadows of evening were closing in around them: from the windows of\nthe houses close by dim, yellow lights began to blink like eyes.\nOverhead, the exquisite towers of Ste. Gudule stood out against the\nstormy sky like perfect, delicate lace-work turned to stone, whilst the\nglass of the west window glittered like a sheet of sapphires and\nemeralds and rubies, as it caught the last rays of the sinking sun.\nCrystal's graceful figure stood out in its white, summer draperies,\nclear and crystalline as herself against the sombre background of the\ncathedral porch.\n\nAnd Maurice watched her through the dim shadows of gathering twilight:\nhe watched her as a fowler watches the bird which he has captured and\nnever wholly tamed. Somehow he felt that her love for him was not quite\nwhat it had been until now: that she was no longer the same girlish,\nsubmissive creature on whose soft cheeks a word or look from him had the\npower to raise a flush of joy.\n\nShe was different now--in a curious, intangible way which he could not\ndefine.\n\nAnd jealousy reared up its threatening head more insistently:--bitter\njealousy which embraced de Marmont, Clyffurde, Fate and\nCircumstance--but Clyffurde above all--the stranger hitherto deemed of\nno account, but who now--wounded, abandoned, dying, perhaps--seemed a\nmore formidable rival than Maurice awhile ago had deemed possible.\n\nHe cursed himself for that touch of sentiment--he called it\ncowardice--which the other night, after the ball, had prompted him to\nwrite to Crystal. But for that voluntary confession--he thought--she\ncould never have despised him. And following up the train of his own\nthoughts, and realising that these had not been spoken aloud, he\nsuddenly called out abruptly:\n\n\"Is it because of my letter, Crystal?\"\n\nShe gave a start, and turned even paler than she had been before.\nObviously she had been brought roughly back from the land of dreams.\n\n\"Your letter, Maurice?\" she asked vaguely, \"what do you mean?\"\n\n\"I wrote you a letter the other night,\" he continued, speaking quickly\nand harshly, \"after the ball. Did you receive it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And read it?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"And is it because of it that your love for me has gone?\"\n\nHe had not meant to put his horrible suspicions into words. The very\nfact--now that he had spoken--appeared more tangible, even irremediable.\nShe did not reply to his taunt, and he came a little closer to her and\ntook her hand, and when she tried to withdraw it from his grasp he held\nit tightly and bent down his head so that in the gathering gloom he\ncould read every line of her face.\n\n\"Because of what I told you in my letter you despised me, did you not?\"\nhe asked.\n\nAgain she made no reply. What could she say that would not hurt him far\nmore than did her silence? The next moment he had drawn her back right\ninto the shadow of the cathedral walls, into a dark angle, where no one\ncould see either her or him. He placed his hands upon her shoulders and\ncompelled her to look him straight in the face.\n\n\"Listen, Crystal,\" he said slowly and with desperate earnestness. \"Once,\nlong ago, I gave you up to de Marmont, to affluence and to\nconsiderations of your name and of our caste. It all but broke my heart,\nbut I did it because your father demanded that sacrifice from you and\nfrom me. I was ready then to stand aside and to give up all the dreams\nof my youth. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. But now everything is different. For one thing, the\nevents of the past hundred days have made every man many years older:\nthe hell I went through to-day has helped to make a more sober, more\ndetermined man of me. Now I will not give you up. I will not. My way is\nclear: I can win you with your father's consent and give him and you all\nthat de Marmont had promised. The King trusts me and will give me what I\nask. I am no longer a wastrel, no longer poor and obscure. And I will\nnot give you up--I swear it by all that I have gone through to-day. I\nwill not! if I have to kill with my own hand every one who stands in my\nway.\"\n\nAnd Crystal, smiling, quite kindly and a little abstractedly at his\nimpulsive earnestness, gently removed his hands from her shoulders and\nsaid calmly:\n\n\"You are tired, Maurice, and overwrought. Shall we go in and wait for\nfather? He will be getting anxious about me.\" And without waiting to see\nif he followed her, she turned to walk toward the steps.\n\nSt. Genis smothered a violent oath, but he said nothing more. He was\nsatisfied with what he had done. He knew that women liked a masterful\nman and he meant every word which he said. He would not give her up\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. not now .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and not to .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Ye gods! he would not think of\nthat;--he would not think of the lonely roadside nor of the wounded man\nwho had robbed him of Crystal's love. He had done his duty by\nClyffurde--what more could he have done at this hour?--and he meant to\ndo far more than that--he meant to go back to the English hospital as\nsoon as possible, to see that Clyffurde had every attention, every care,\nevery comfort that human sympathy can bestow. What more could he do? He\nwould have done no good by going out with the ambulance himself--surely\nnot--he would have missed seeing Crystal--and she would have fretted and\nbeen still more anxious .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. his first duty was to Crystal .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. St. Genis only thought of Crystal and of himself and the\nvoice of Conscience was compulsorily stilled.\n\n\nIII\n\nHaving lulled his conscience to sleep and satisfied his self-love by a\npassionate tirade, Maurice followed Crystal down the steps at the west\nfront of Ste. Gudule.\n\nImmediately opposite them at the corner of the narrow rue de Ligne was\nthe old Auberge des Trois Rois, from whence the diligence started twice\na day in time to catch the tide and the English packet at Ostend.\nMaurice and Crystal stood for a moment together on the steps watching\nthe bustle and excitement, the comings and goings of the crowd, which\nalways attend such departures. All day there had been a steady stream of\nfugitives out of the town, taking their belongings with them: the\ndiligence was for the well-to-do and the indifferent who hurried away to\nEngland to await the advent of more settled times.\n\nVictor de Marmont had secured his place inside the coach. He had\nexchanged his borrowed uniform for civilian clothes, he had bestowed his\nbelongings in the vehicle and he was standing about desultorily waiting\nfor the hour of departure. The diligence would not arrive at Ostend till\nfive o'clock in the morning: then with the tide the packet would go out,\ngetting into London well after midday. Chance, as represented by the\ntide, had seriously handicapped de Marmont's plans. But enthusiasm and\ndoggedness of purpose whispered to him that he still held the winning\ncard. The English packet was timed to arrive in London by two o'clock in\nthe afternoon, he would still have two hours to his credit before\nclosing time on 'Change and another hour in the street. Time to find his\nbroker and half an hour to spare: that would still leave him an hour\nwherein to make a fortune for his Emperor.\n\nAt one time he was afraid that he would not be able to secure a seat in\nthe diligence, so numerous were the travellers who wished to leave\nBrussels behind them. But in this, Chance and the length of his purse\nfavoured him: he bought his seat for an exorbitant price, but he bought\nit; and at nine o'clock the diligence was timed to start.\n\nIt was now half-past eight. And just then de Marmont caught sight of\nCrystal and St. Genis coming down the cathedral steps.\n\nHe had half an hour to spare and he followed them. He wanted to speak to\nCrystal--he had wanted it all day--but the difficulty of getting what\nclothes he required and the trouble and time spent in bargaining for a\nseat in the diligence had stood in his way. M. le Comte de Cambray would\nnever, of course, admit him inside his doors, and it would have meant\nhanging about in the rue du Marais and trusting to a chance meeting with\nCrystal when she went out, and for this he had not the time.\n\nAnd the chance meeting had come about in spite of all adverse\ncircumstances: and de Marmont followed Crystal through the crowded\nstreets, hoping that St. Genis would take leave of her before she went\nindoors. But even if he did not, de Marmont meant to have a few words\nwith Crystal. He was going to win a gigantic fortune for the\nEmperor--one wherewith that greatest of all adventurers could once again\nrecreate the Empire of France: he himself--rich already--would become\nricher still and also--if his coup succeeded--one of the most trusted,\nmost influential men in the recreated Empire. He felt that with the\noffer of his name he could pour out a veritable cornucopia of abundant\nglory, honours, wealth at a woman's feet. And his ambition had always\nbeen bound up in a great measure with Crystal de Cambray. He certainly\nloved her in his way, for her beauty and her charm; but, above all, he\nlooked on her as the very personification of the old and proud regime\nwhich had thought fit to scorn the parvenu noblesse of the Empire, and\nfor a powerful adherent of Napoleon to be possessed of a wife out of\nthat exclusive milieu was like a fresh and glorious trophy of war on a\nconqueror's chariot-wheel.\n\nDe Marmont had the supreme faith of an ambitious man in the power of\nwealth and of court favour. He knew that Napoleon was not a man who ever\nforgot a service efficiently rendered, and would repay this\none--rendered at the supreme hour of disaster--with a surfeit of\ngratitude and of gifts which must perforce dazzle any woman's eyes and\nconquer her imagination.\n\nBesides his schemes, his ambitions, the future which awaited him, what\nhad an impecunious wastrel like St. Genis to offer to a woman like\nCrystal de Cambray?\n\n\nOutside the house in the rue du Marais where the Comte de Cambray\nlodged, St. Genis and Crystal paused, and de Marmont, who still kept\nwithin the shadows, waited for a favourable opportunity to make his\npresence known.\n\n\"I'll find M. le Comte and bring him back with me,\" he heard St. Genis\nsaying. \"You are sure I shall find him at the L\u00c3\u00a9gitimiste?\"\n\n\"Quite sure,\" Crystal replied. \"He did not mean to leave the Cercle till\nabout nine. He is sure to wait for every bit of news that comes in.\"\n\n\"It will be a great moment for me, if I am the first to bring in\nauthentic good news.\"\n\n\"You will be quite the first, I should say,\" she assented, \"but don't\nlet father stay too long talking. Bring him back quickly. Remember I\nhaven't heard all the news yet myself.\"\n\nSt. Genis went up to the front door and rang the bell, then he took\nleave of Crystal. De Marmont waited his opportunity. Anon, Jeanne opened\nthe door, and St. Genis walked quickly back down the street.\n\nCrystal paused a moment by the open door in order to talk to Jeanne, and\nwhile she did so de Marmont slipped quickly past her into the house and\nwas some way down the corridor before the two women had recovered from\ntheir surprise. Jeanne, as was her wont, was ready to scream, but\ndespite the fast gathering gloom Crystal had at once recognised de\nMarmont. She turned a cold look upon him.\n\n\"An intrusion, Monsieur?\" she asked quietly.\n\n\"We'll call it that, Mademoiselle, an you will,\" he replied\nimperturbably, \"and if you will kindly order your servant to go, it\nshall be a very brief one.\"\n\n\"My father is from home,\" she said.\n\nDe Marmont smiled and shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I know that,\" he said, \"or I would not be here.\"\n\n\"Then your intrusion is that of a coward, if you knew that I was\nunprotected.\"\n\n\"Are you afraid of me, Crystal?\" he asked with a sneer.\n\n\"I am afraid of no one,\" she replied. \"But since you and I have nothing\nto say to one another, I beg that you will no longer force your company\nupon me.\"\n\n\"Your pardon, but there is something very important which I must say to\nyou. I have news of to-day's doings out there at Waterloo, which bear\nupon the whole of your future and upon your happiness. I myself leave\nfor England in less than half an hour. I was taking my place in the\ndiligence outside the Trois Rois when I saw you coming down the\ncathedral steps. Fate has given me an opportunity for which I sought\nvainly all day. You will never regret it, Crystal, if you listen to me\nnow.\"\n\n\"I listen,\" she broke in coolly. \"I pray you be as brief as you can.\"\n\n\"Will you order the servant to go?\"\n\nFor a moment longer she hesitated. Commonsense told her that it was\nneither prudent nor expedient to hold converse with this man, who was an\navowed and bitter enemy of her cause. But he had spoken of the doings at\nWaterloo and spoken of them in connection with her own future and her\nhappiness, and--prudent or not--she wanted to hear what he had to say,\nin the vague hope that from a chance word carelessly dropped by Victor\nde Marmont she would glean, if only a scrap, some news of that on which\nSt. Genis would not dwell but on which hung her heart and her very\nlife--the fate of the British troops.\n\nAfter all he might know something, he might say something which would\nhelp her to bear this intolerable misery of uncertainty: and on the\nmerest chance of that she threw prudence to the winds.\n\n\"You may go, Jeanne,\" she said. \"But remain within call. Leave the front\ndoor open,\" she added. \"M. le Comte and M. le Marquis will be here\ndirectly.\"\n\n\"Oh! you are well protected,\" said Victor de Marmont with a careless\nshrug of the shoulders, as Jeanne's heavy, shuffling footsteps died away\ndown the corridor.\n\n\"Now, M. de Marmont,\" said Crystal coolly. \"I listen.\"\n\nShe was leaning back against the wall--her hands behind her, her pale\nface and large blue eyes with their black dilated pupils turned\nquestioningly upon him. The walls of the corridor were painted white,\nafter the manner of Flemish houses, the tiled floor was white too, and\nCrystal herself was dressed all in white, so that the whole scene made\nup of pale, soft tints looked weird and ghostly in the twilight and\nCrystal like an ethereal creature come down from the land of nymphs and\nof elves.\n\nAnd de Marmont, too--like St. Genis a while ago--felt that never had\nthis beautiful woman--she was no longer a girl now--looked more\nexquisite and more desirable, and he--conscious of the power which\nfortune and success can give, thought that he could woo and win her once\nagain in spite of caste-prejudice and of political hatred. St. Genis had\nfelt his position unassailable by virtue of old associations, common\nsympathies and youthful vows: de Marmont relied on feminine ambition,\nlove of power, of wealth and of station, and at this moment in Crystal's\nshining eyes he only read excitement and the unspoken desire for all\nthat he was prepared to offer.\n\n\"I have only a few moments to spare, Crystal,\" he said slowly, and with\nearnest emphasis, \"so I will be very brief. For the moment the Emperor\nhas suffered a defeat--as he did at Eylau or at Leipzic--his defeats are\nalways momentary, his victories alone are decisive and abiding. The\nwhole world knows that. It needs no proclaiming from me. But in order to\nretrieve that momentary defeat of to-day he has deigned to ask my help.\nThe gods are good to me! they have put it within my power to help my\nEmperor in his need. I am going to England to-night in order to carry\nout his instructions. By to-morrow afternoon I shall have finished my\nwork. The Empire of France will once more rise triumphant and glorious\nout of the ashes of a brief defeat; the Emperor once more, Ph\u00c5\u0093bus-like,\nwill drive the chariot of the Sun, Lord and Master of Europe, greater\nsince his downfall, more powerful, more majestic than ever before. And\nI, who will have been the humble instrument of his reconquered glory,\nwill deserve to the full his bounty and his gratitude.\"\n\nHe paused for lack of breath, for indeed he had talked fast and volubly:\nCrystal's voice, cold and measured, broke in on the silence that ensued.\n\n\"And in what way does all this concern me, M. de Marmont?\" she asked.\n\n\"It concerns your whole future, Crystal,\" he replied with ever-growing\nsolemnity and conviction. \"You must have known all along that I have\nnever ceased to love you: you have always been the only possible woman\nfor me--my ideal, in fact. Your father's injustice I am willing to\nforget. Your troth was plighted to me and I have done nothing to deserve\nall the insults which he thought fit to heap upon me. I wanted you to\nknow, Crystal, that my love is still yours, and that the fortune and\nglory which I now go forth to win I will place with inexpressible joy at\nyour feet.\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders and an air of supreme indifference spread\nover her face. \"Is that all?\" she asked coldly.\n\n\"All? What do you mean? I don't understand.\"\n\n\"I mean that you persuaded me to listen to you on the pretence that you\nhad news to tell me of the doings at Waterloo--news on which my\nhappiness depended. You have not told me a single fact that concerns me\nin the least.\"\n\n\"It concerns you as it concerns me, Crystal. Your happiness is bound up\nwith mine. You are still my promised wife. I go to win glory for my name\nwhich will soon be yours. You and I, Crystal, hand in hand! think of\nit! our love has survived the political turmoils--united in love,\nunited in glory, you and I will be the most brilliant stars that will\nshine at the Imperial Court of France.\"\n\nShe did not try to interrupt his tirade, but looked on him with cool\nwonderment, as one gazes on some curious animal that is raving and\nraging behind iron bars. When he had finished she said quietly:\n\n\"You are mad, I think, M. de Marmont. At any rate, you had better go\nnow: time is getting on, and you will lose your place in the diligence.\"\n\nHe was less to her than the dust under her feet, and his protestations\nhad not even the power to rouse her wrath. Indeed, all that worried her\nat this moment was vexation with herself for having troubled to listen\nto him at all: it had been worse than foolish to suppose that he had any\nnews to impart which did not directly concern himself. So now, while he,\nutterly taken aback, was staring at her open-mouthed and bewildered, she\nturned away, cold and full of disdain, gathering her draperies round\nher, and started to walk slowly toward the stairs. Her clinging white\nskirt made a soft, swishing sound as it brushed the tiled floor, and she\nherself--with her slender figure, graceful neck and crown of golden\ncurls, looked, as the gloom of evening wrapped her in, more like an\nintangible elf--an apparition--gliding through space, than just a\nscornful woman who had thought fit to reject the importunate addresses\nof an unwelcome suitor.\n\nShe left de Marmont standing there in the corridor--like some\npresumptuous beggar--burning with rage and humiliation, too\ninsignificant even to be feared. But he was not the man to accept such a\nsituation calmly: his love for Crystal had never been anything but a\nselfish one--born of the desire to possess a high-born, elegant wife,\ntaken out of the very caste which had scorned him and his kind: her\nacquiescence he had always taken for granted: her love he meant to win\nafter his wooing of her hand had been successful--until then he could\nwait. So certain too was he of his own power to win her, in virtue of\nall that he had to offer, that he would not take her scorn for real or\nher refusal to listen to him as final.\n\n\nIV\n\nBefore she had reached the foot of the stairs, he was already by her\nside, and with a masterful hand upon her arm had compelled her, by\nphysical strength, to turn and to face him once more.\n\n\"Crystal,\" he said, forcing himself to speak quietly, even though his\nvoice quivered with excitement and passionate wrath, \"as you say, I have\nonly a few moments to spare, but they are just long enough for me to\ntell you that it is you who are mad. I daresay that it is difficult to\nbelieve in the immensity of a disaster. M. de St. Genis no doubt has\nbeen filling your ears with tales of the allied armies' victories. But\nlook at me, Crystal--look at me and tell me if you have ever seen a man\nmore in deadly earnest. I tell you that I am on my way to aid the\nEmperor in reforming his Empire on a more solid basis than it has ever\nstood before. Have you ever known Napoleon to fail in what he set\nhimself to do? I tell you that he is not crushed--that he is not even\ndefeated. Within a month the allies will be on their knees begging for\npeace. The era of your Bourbon kings is more absolutely dead to-day than\nit has ever been. And after to-day there will be nothing for a royalist\nlike your father or like Maurice de St. Genis but exile and humiliation\nmore dire than before. Your father's fate rests entirely in your hands.\nI can direct his destiny, his life or his death, just as I please. When\nyou are my wife, I will forgive him the insults which he heaped on me at\nBrestalou .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but not before. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. As for Maurice de St. Genis\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"And what of him, you abominable cur?\"\n\nThe shout which came from behind him checked the words on de Marmont's\nlips. He let go his hold of Crystal's arm as he felt two sinewy hands\ngripping him by the throat. The attack was so swift and so unexpected\nthat he was entirely off his guard: he lost his footing upon the\nslippery floor, and before he could recover himself he was being forced\nback and back until his spine was bent nearly double and his head\npressed down backward almost to the level of his knees.\n\n\"Let him go, Maurice! you might kill him. Throw him out of the door.\"\n\nIt was M. le Comte de Cambray who spoke. He and St. Genis had arrived\njust in time to save Crystal from a further unpleasant scene. She,\nhowever, had not lost her presence of mind. She had certainly listened\nto de Marmont's final tirade, because she knew that she was helpless in\nhis hands, but she had never been frightened for a moment. Jeanne was\nwithin call, and she herself had never been timorous: at the same time\nshe was thankful enough that her father and St. Genis were here.\n\nMaurice was almost blind with rage: he would have killed de Marmont but\nfor the Comte's timely words, which luckily had the effect of sobering\nhim at this critical moment. He relaxed his convulsive grip on de\nMarmont's throat, but the latter had already lost his balance; he fell\nheavily, his body sliding along the slippery floor, while his head\nstruck against the projecting woodwork of the door.\n\nHe uttered a loud cry of pain as he fell, then remained lying inert on\nthe ground, and in the dim light his face took on an ashen hue.\n\nIn an instant Crystal was by his side.\n\n\"You have killed him, Maurice,\" she cried, as woman-like--tender and\nfull of compassion now--she ran to the stricken man.\n\n\"I hope I have,\" said St. Genis sullenly. \"He deserved the death of a\ncur.\"\n\n\"Father, dear,\" said Crystal authoritatively, \"will you call to Jeanne\nto bring water, a sponge, towels--quickly: also some brandy.\"\n\nShe paid no heed to St. Genis: and she had already forgotten de\nMarmont's dastardly attitude toward herself. She only saw that he was\nhelpless and in pain: she knelt by his side, pillowed his head on her\nlap, and with soothing, gentle fingers felt his shoulders, his arms, to\nsee where he was hurt. He opened his eyes very soon and encountered\nthose tender blue eyes so full of sweet pity now: \"It is only my head, I\nthink,\" he said.\n\nThen he tried to move, but fell back again with a groan of pain: \"My leg\nis broken, I am afraid,\" he murmured feebly.\n\n\"I had best fetch a doctor,\" rejoined M. le Comte.\n\n\"If you can find one, father, dear,\" said Crystal. \"M. de Marmont ought\nto be moved at once to his home.\"\n\n\"No! no!\" protested Victor feebly, \"not home! to the Trois Rois .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nthe diligence. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I must go to England to-night .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. the Emperor's\norders.\"\n\n\"The doctor will decide,\" said Crystal gently. \"Father, dear, will you\ngo?\"\n\nJeanne came with water and brandy. De Marmont drank eagerly of the one,\nand then sipped the other.\n\n\"I must go,\" he said more firmly, \"the diligence starts at nine\no'clock.\"\n\nAgain he tried to move, and a great cry of agony rose to his throat--not\nof physical pain, though that was great too, but the wild, agonising\nshriek of mental torment, of disappointment and wrath and misery,\ngreater than human heart could bear.\n\n\"The Emperor's orders!\" he cried. \"I must go!\"\n\nCrystal was silent. There was something great and majestic, something\nthat compelled admiration and respect in this tragic impotence, this\nfailure brought about by uncontrolled passion at the very hour when\nsuccess--perhaps--might yet have changed the whole destinies of the\nworld. De Marmont lying here, helpless to aid his Emperor--through the\nfurious and jealous attack of a rival--was at this moment more worthy of\na good woman's regard than he had been in the flush of his success and\nof his arrogance, for his one thought was of the Emperor and what he\ncould no longer do for him. He tried to move and could not: \"The\nEmperor's orders!\" came at times with pathetic persistence from his\nlips, and Crystal--woman-like--tried to soothe and comfort him in his\nfailure, even though his triumph would only have aroused her scorn.\n\nAnd time sped on. From the towers of the cathedral came booming the hour\nof nine. The shadows in the narrow street were long and dark, only a\npale thin reflex of the cold light of the moon struck into the open\ndoorway and the white corridor, and detached de Marmont's pale face from\nthe surrounding gloom.\n\nThe Emperor's orders and because of a woman these could now no longer be\nobeyed. If de Marmont had not seen Crystal on the cathedral steps, if he\nhad not followed her--if he had not allowed his passion and arrogant\nself-will to blind him to time and to surroundings--who knows? but the\nwhole map of Europe might yet have been changed.\n\nA fortune in London was awaiting a gambler who chose to stake everything\non a last throw--a fortune wherewith the greatest adventurer the world\nhas ever known might yet have reconstituted an army and reconquered an\nEmpire--and he who might have won that fortune was lying in the narrow\ncorridor of an humble lodging house--with a broken leg--helpless and\neating out his heart now with vain regret. Why? Because of a girl with\nfair curls and blue eyes--just a woman--young and desirable--another\ntiny pawn in the hands of the Great Master of this world's game.\n\nThe rain in the morning at Waterloo--Bl\u00c3\u00bccher's arrival or Grouchy's--a\nman's selfish passion for a woman who cared nothing for him--who shall\ndare to say that these tiny, trivial incidents changed the destinies of\nthe world?\n\nThink on it, O ye materialists! ye worshippers of Chance! Is it indeed\nthe infinitesimal doings of pigmies that bring about the great upheavals\nof the earth? Do ye not rather see God's will in that fall of rain?\nGod's breath in those dying heroes who fell on Mont Saint Jean? do ye\nnot recognise that it was God's finger that pointed the way to Bl\u00c3\u00bccher\nand stretched de Marmont down helpless on the ground?\n\n\nV\n\nThe arrival of M. le Comte de Cambray, accompanied by a doctor and two\nmen carrying an improvised stretcher, broke the spell of silence that\nhad fallen on this strange scene of pathetic failure which seemed but an\nhumble counterpart of that great and irretrievable one which was being\nenacted at this same hour far away on the road to Genappe.\n\nAfter the booming of the cathedral clock, de Marmont had ceased to\nstruggle: he accepted defeat probably because he, too--in spite of\nhimself--saw that the day of his idol's destiny was over, and that the\nbrilliant Star which had glittered on the firmament of Europe for a\nquarter of a century had by the will of God now irretrievably declined.\nHe had accepted Crystal's ministrations for his comfort with a look of\ngratitude. Jeanne had put a pillow to his head, and he lay now outwardly\nplacid and quiescent.\n\nEven, perhaps--for such is human nature and such the heart of youth--as\nhe saw Crystal's sweet face bent with so much pity toward him a sense\nof hope, of happiness yet to be, chased the more melancholy thoughts\naway. Crystal was kind--he argued to himself--she has already\nforgiven--women are so ready to forgive faults and errors that spring\nfrom an intensity of love.\n\nHe sought her hand and she gave it--just as a sweet Sister of Mercy and\nGentleness would do, for whom the individual man--even the enemy--does\nnot exist--only the suffering human creature whom her touch can soothe.\nHe persuaded himself easily enough that when he pressed her hand she\nreturned the pressure, and renewed hope went forth once more soaring\nupon the wings of fancy.\n\nThen the doctor came. M. le Comte had been fortunate in securing\nhim--had with impulsive generosity promised him ample payment--and then\nbrought him along without delay. He praised Mlle. de Cambray for her\nkindness to the patient, asked a few questions as to how the accident\nhad occurred, and was satisfied that M. de Marmont had slipped on the\ntiled floor and then struck his head against the door. He was not likely\nto examine the purple bruises on the patient's throat: his business\nbegan and ended with a broken leg to mend. As M. le Comte de Cambray\nassured him that M. de Marmont was very wealthy, the worthy doctor most\nreadily offered his patient the hospitality of his own house until\ncomplete recovery.\n\nHe then superintended the lifting of the sick man on to the stretcher,\nand having taken final leave of M. le Comte, Mademoiselle and all those\nconcerned and given his instructions to the bearers, he was the first to\nleave the house.\n\nM. le Comte, pleasantly conscious of Christian duty toward an enemy\nnobly fulfilled, nodded curtly to de Marmont, whom he hated with all his\nheart, and then turned his back on an exceedingly unpleasant scene,\nfervently wishing that it had never occurred in his house, and equally\nfervently thankful that the accident had not more fateful consequences.\nHe retired to his smoking-room, calling to St. Genis and to Crystal to\nfollow him.\n\nBut Crystal did not go at once. She stood in the dark corridor--quite\nstill--watching the stretcher bearers in their careful, silent work,\nlittle guessing on what a filmy thread her whole destiny was hanging at\nthis moment. The Fates were spinning, spinning, spinning and she did not\nknow it. Had the solemn silence which hung so ominously in the twilight\nnot been broken till after the sick man had been borne away, the whole\nof Crystal's future would have been shaped differently.\n\nBut as with the rain at Waterloo, God had need of a tool for the\nfurtherance of His will and it was Maurice de St. Genis whom He\nchose--Maurice who with his own words set the final seal to his destiny.\n\nDe Marmont's eyes as he was being carried over the threshold dwelt upon\nthe graceful form of Crystal--clad all in white--all womanliness and\ngentleness now--her sweet face only faintly distinguishable in the\ngloom. St. Genis, whose nerves were still jarred with all that he had\ngone through to-day and irritated by Crystal's assiduity beside the sick\nman, resented that last look of farewell which de Marmont dared to throw\nupon the woman whom he loved. An ungenerous impulse caused him to try\nand aim a last moral blow at his enemy:\n\n\"Come, Crystal,\" he said coldly, \"the man has been better looked after\nthan he deserves. But for your father's interference I should have wrung\nhis neck like the cowardly brute that he was.\"\n\nAnd with the masterful air of a man who has both right and privilege on\nhis side, he put his arm round Crystal's waist and tried to draw her\naway, and as he did so he whispered a tender: \"Come, Crystal!\" in her\near.\n\nDe Marmont--who at this moment was taking a last fond look at the girl\nhe loved, and was busy the while making plans for a happy future\nwherein Crystal would play the chief r\u00c3\u00b4le and would console him for all\ndisappointments by the magnitude of her love--de Marmont was brought\nback from the land of dreams by the tender whisperings of his rival. His\nown helplessness sent a flood of jealous wrath surging up to his brain.\nThe wild hatred which he had always felt for St. Genis ever since that\nawful humiliation which he had suffered at Brestalou, now blinded him to\neverything save to the fact that here was a rival who was gloating over\nhis helplessness--a man who twice already had humiliated him before\nCrystal de Cambray--a man who had every advantage of caste and of\ncommunity of sympathy! a man therefore who must be in his turn\nirretrievably crushed in the sight of the woman whom he still hoped to\nwin!\n\nDe Marmont had no definite idea as to what he meant to do. Perhaps, just\nat this moment, the pale, intangible shadow of Reason had lifted up one\ncorner of the veil that hid the truth from before his eyes--the absolute\nand naked fact that Crystal de Cambray was not destined for him. She\nwould never marry him--never. The Empire of France was no more--the\nEmperor was a fugitive. To St. Genis and his caste belonged the\nfuture--and the turn had come for the adherents of the fallen Emperor to\nsink into obscurity or to go into exile.\n\nBe that as it may, it is certain that in this fateful moment de Marmont\nwas only conscious of an all-powerful overwhelming feeling of hatred and\nthe determination that whatever happened to himself he must and would\nprevent St. Genis from ever approaching Crystal de Cambray with words of\nlove again. That he had the power to do this he was fully conscious.\n\n\"Crystal!\" he called, and at the same time ordered the bearers to halt\non the doorstep for a moment. \"Crystal, will you give me your hand in\nfarewell?\"\n\nThe young girl would probably have complied with his wish, but St. Genis\ninterposed.\n\n\"Crystal,\" he said authoritatively, \"your father has already called you.\nYou have done everything that Christian charity demands. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" And once\nmore he tried to draw the young girl away.\n\n\"Do not touch her, man,\" called de Marmont in a loud voice, \"a coward\nlike you has no right to touch the hand of a good woman.\"\n\n\"M. de Marmont,\" broke in Crystal hotly, \"you presume on your\nhelplessness. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Pay no heed to the ravings of a maniac, Crystal,\" interposed St. Genis\ncalmly, \"he has fallen so low now, that contemptuous pity is all that he\ndeserves.\"\n\n\"And contempt without pity is all that you deserve, M. le Marquis de St.\nGenis,\" cried de Marmont excitedly. \"Ask him, Mademoiselle Crystal, ask\nhim where is the man who to-day saved his life? whom I myself saw to-day\non the roadside, wounded and half dead with fatigue, on horseback, with\nthe inert body of M. de St. Genis lying across his saddle-bow. Ask him\nhow he came to lie across that saddle-bow? and whether his English\nfriend and mine, Bobby Clyffurde, did not--as any who passed by could\nguess--drag him out of that hell at Waterloo and bring him into safety,\nwhilst risking his own life. Ask him,\" he continued, working himself up\ninto a veritable fever of vengeful hatred, as he saw that St.\nGenis--sullen and glowering--was doing his best to drag Crystal away, to\nprevent her from listening further to this awful indictment, these\nravings of a lunatic half-distraught with hate. \"Ask him where is\nClyffurde now? to what lonely spot he has crawled in order to die while\nM. le Marquis de St. Genis came back in gay apparel to court Mlle.\nCrystal de Cambray? Ah! M. de St. Genis, you tried to heap opprobrium\nupon me--you talked glibly of contempt and of pity. Of a truth 'tis I\ndo pity you now, for Mademoiselle Crystal will surely ask you all those\nquestions, and by the Lord I marvel how you will answer them.\"\n\nHe fell back exhausted, in a dead faint no doubt, and St. Genis with a\nwild cry like that of a beast in fury seized the nearest weapon that\ncame to his hand--a heavy oak chair which stood against the wall in the\ncorridor--and brandished it over his head. He would--had not Crystal at\nonce interposed--have killed de Marmont with one blow: even so he tried\nto avoid Crystal in order to forge for himself a clear passage, to free\nhimself from all trammels so that he might indulge his lust to kill.\n\n\"Take the sick man away! quickly!\" cried Crystal to the stretcher\nbearers. And they--realising the danger--the awfulness of the tragedy\nwhich, with that clumsy weapon wielded by a man who was maddened with\nrage, was hovering in the air, hurried over the threshold with their\nburden as fast as they could: then out into the street: and Crystal\nseizing hold of the front door shut it to with a loud bang after them.\n\n\nVI\n\nThen with a cry that was just primitive in its passion--savage almost\nlike that of a lioness in the desert who has been robbed of her\nyoung--she turned upon St. Genis:\n\n\"Where is he now?\" she called, and her voice was quite unrecognisable,\nharsh and hoarse and peremptory.\n\n\"Crystal, let me assure you,\" protested Maurice, \"that I have already\ndone all that lay in my power. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Where is he now?\" she broke in with the same fierce intensity.\n\nShe stood there before him--wild, haggard, palpitating--a passionate\ncreature passionately demanding to know where the loved one was. It\nseemed as if she would have torn the words out of St. Genis' throat, so\nbitter and intense was the look of contempt and of hatred wherewith she\nlooked on him.\n\nM. le Comte--very much upset and ruffled by all that he had heard--came\nout of his room just in time to see the stretcher-bearers disappearing\nwith their burden through the front door, and the door itself closed to\nwith a bang by Crystal. Truly his sense of decorum and of the fitness of\nthings had received a severe shock and now he had the additional\nmortification of seeing his beautiful daughter--his dainty and\naristocratic Crystal--in a state bordering on frenzy.\n\n\"My darling Crystal,\" he exclaimed, as he made his way quickly to her\nside and put a restraining hand upon her arm.\n\nBut Crystal now was far beyond his control: she shook off his hand--she\npaid no heed to him, she went closer up to St. Genis and once more\nrepeated her ardent, passionate query:\n\n\"Where is he now?\"\n\n\"At the English hospital, I hope,\" said St. Genis with as much cool\ndignity as he could command. \"Have I not assured you, Crystal, that I've\ndone all I could? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"At the English hospital? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you hope? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" she retorted in a voice\nthat sounded trenchant and shrill through the overwhelming passion which\nshook and choked it in her throat. \"But the roadside--where you left him\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. to die in a ditch perhaps .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. like a dog that has no home? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nwhere was that?\"\n\n\"I gave full directions at the English hospital,\" he replied. \"I\narranged for an ambulance to go and find him .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. for a bed for him\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Give me those directions,\" she commanded.\n\n\"On the way to Waterloo .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. on the left side of the road .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. close\nby the six kilom\u00c3\u00a8tre milestone .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. the angle of the forest of Soigne\nis just there .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and there is a meadow which joins the edge of the\nwood where they were making hay to-day. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. No driver can fail to find\nthe place, Crystal .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. the ambulance. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nBut now she was no longer listening to him. She had abruptly turned her\nback on him and made for the door. Her father interposed.\n\n\"What do you want to do, Crystal?\" he said peremptorily.\n\n\"Go to him, of course,\" she said quietly--for she was quite calm now--at\nany rate outwardly--strong and of set purpose.\n\n\"But you do not know where he is.\"\n\n\"I'll go to the English hospital first .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. father, dear, will you let\nme pass?\"\n\n\"Crystal,\" said M. le Comte firmly, as he stood his ground between his\ndaughter and the door, \"you cannot go rushing through the streets of\nBrussels alone--at this hour of the night--through all the soldiery and\nall the drunken rabble.\"\n\n\"He is dying,\" she retorted, \"and I am going to find him. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"You have taken leave of your senses, Crystal,\" said the Comte sternly.\n\"You seem to have forgotten your own personal dignity. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Father! let me go!\" she demanded--for she had tried to measure her\nphysical strength against his, and he was holding her wrists now whilst\na look of great anger was on his face.\n\n\"I tell you, Crystal,\" he said, \"that you cannot go. I will do all that\nlies in my power in the matter: I promise you: and Maurice,\" he added\nharshly, \"if he has a spark of manhood left in him will do his best to\nsecond me .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but I cannot allow my daughter to go into the streets at\nthis hour of the night.\"\n\n\"But you cannot prevent your sister from doing as she likes,\" here broke\nin a tart voice from the back of the corridor. \"Crystal, child! try and\nbear up while I run to the English hospital first and, if necessary, to\nthe English doctor afterwards. And you, Monsieur my brother, be good\nenough to allow Jeanne to open the door for me.\"\n\nAnd Madame la Duchesse d'Agen in bonnet and shawl, helpful and\npractical, made her way quietly to the door, preceded by faithful\nJeanne. With a cry of infinite relief--almost of happiness--Crystal at\nlast managed to disengage herself from her father's grasp and ran to the\nold woman: \"_Ma tante_,\" she said imploringly, \"take me with you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nif I do not go to find him now .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. at once .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. my heart will break.\"\n\nM. le Comte shrugged his shoulders and stood aside. He knew that in an\nargument with his sister, he would surely be worsted: and there was a\nlook in Madame's face which, even in this dim twilight, he knew how to\ninterpret. It meant that Madame would carry out her programme just as\nshe had stated it, and that she would take Crystal with her--with or\nwithout the father's consent. So, realising this, M. le Comte had but\none course left open to him and that was to safeguard his own dignity by\nmaking the best of this situation--of which he still highly disapproved.\n\n\"Well, my dear Sophie,\" he said, \"I suppose if you insist on having your\nway, you must have it: though what the women of our rank are coming to\nnowadays I cannot imagine. At the same time I for my part must insist\nthat Crystal at least puts on a bonnet and shawl and does not career\nabout the streets dressed like a kitchen wench.\"\n\n\"Crystal,\" whispered Madame, who was nothing if not practical, \"do as\nyour father wishes--it will save a lot of argument and save time as\nwell.\"\n\nBut even before the words were out of Madame's mouth, Crystal was\nrunning along the corridor--ready to obey. At the foot of the stairs St.\nGenis intercepted her.\n\n\"Let me pass!\" she cried wildly.\n\n\"Not before you have said that you have forgiven me!\" he entreated as he\nclung to her white draperies with a passionate gesture of appeal.\n\nAn exclamation which was almost one of loathing escaped her lips and\nwith a jerk she freed her skirt from his clutch. Then she ran quickly up\nthe stairs. Outside the door of her own room on the first landing she\npaused for one minute, and from out of the gloom her voice came to him\nlike the knell of passing hope.\n\n\"If he comes back alive out of the hell to which you condemned him,\" she\nsaid, \"I may in the future endure the sight of you again. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. If he\ndies .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. may God forgive you!\"\n\nThe opening and shutting of a door told him that she was gone, and he\nwas left in company with his shame.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE WINNING HAND\n\n\nUntil far into the night the air reverberated with incessant\ncannonade--from the direction of Genappe and from that of Wavre--but\njust before dawn all was still. The stream of convoys which bore the\nwounded along the road to Brussels from Mont Saint Jean and Hougoumont\nand La Haye Sainte had momentarily ceased its endless course. The sky\nhad that perfect serenity of a midsummer's night, starlit and azure with\nthe honey-coloured moon sinking slowly down towards the west. Here at\nthe edge of the wood the air had a sweet smell of wet earth and damp\nmoss and freshly cut hay: it had all the delicious softness of a loved\none's embrace.\n\nThrough the roar of distant cannonade, Bobby had slept. For a time after\nSt. Genis left him he had watched the long straight road with dull,\nunseeing eyes--he had seen the first convoy, overfilled with wounded men\nlying huddled on heaped-up straw, and had thanked God that he was lying\non this exquisitely soft carpet made of thousands of tiny green\nplants--moss, grass, weeds, young tendrils and growing buds and opening\nleaves that were delicious to the touch. He had quite forgotten that he\nwas wounded--neither his head nor his leg nor his arm seemed to hurt him\nnow: and he was able to think in peace of Crystal and of her happiness.\n\nSt. Genis would have come to her by then: she would be happy to see him\nsafe and well, and perhaps--in the midst of her joy--she would think of\nthe friend who so gladly offered up his life for her.\n\nWhen the air around was no longer shaken by constant repercussion, Bobby\nfell asleep. It was not yet dawn, even though far away in the east there\nwas a luminous veil that made the sky look like living silver. Behind\nhim among the trees there was a moving and a fluttering--the birds were\nno longer asleep--they had not begun to sing but they were shaking out\ntheir feathers and opening tiny, round eyes in farewell to departing\nnight.\n\nThat gentle fluttering was a sweet lullaby, and Bobby slept and\ndreamed--he dreamed that the fluttering became louder and louder, and\nthat, instead of birds, it was a group of angels that shook their wings\nand stood around him as he slept.\n\nOne of the angels came nearer and laid a hand upon his head--and Bobby\ndreamed that the angel spoke and the words that it said filled Bobby's\nheart with unearthly happiness.\n\n\"My love! my love!\" the angel said, \"will you try and live for my sake?\"\n\nAnd Bobby would not open his eyes, for fear the angel should go away.\nAnd though he knew exactly where he was, and could feel the soft carpet\nof leaves, and smell the sweet moisture in the air, he knew that he must\nstill be dreaming, for angels are not of this earth.\n\nThen a strong kind hand touched his wrist, and felt the beating of his\nheart, and a rough, pleasant voice said in English: \"He is exhausted and\nvery weak, but the fever is not high: he will soon be all right.\" And to\nadd to the wonderful strangeness of his dream, the angel's voice near\nhim murmured: \"Thank God! thank God!\"\n\nWhy should an angel thank God that he--Bobby Clyffurde--was not likely\nto die?\n\nHe opened his eyes to see what it all meant, and he saw--bending over\nhim--a face that was more exquisitely fair than any that man had ever\nseen: eyes that were more blue than the sky above, lips that trembled\nlike rose-leaves in the breeze. He was still dreaming and there was a\nhaze between him and that perfect vision of loveliness. And the kind,\nrough voice somewhere close by said: \"Have you got that stretcher\nready?\" and two other voices replied, \"Yes, Sir.\"\n\nBut the lips close above him said nothing, and it was Bobby now who\nmurmured: \"My love, is it you?\"\n\n\"Your love for always,\" the dear lips replied, \"nothing shall part us\nnow. Yours for always to bring you back to life. Yours when you will\nclaim me--yours for life.\"\n\nThey lifted him onto a stretcher, and then into a carriage and a very\nkind face which he quickly enough recognised as Mme. la Duchesse\nd'Agen's smiled very encouragingly upon him, whereupon he could not help\nbut ask a very pertinent question:\n\n\"Mme. la Duchesse, is all this really happening?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, my good man,\" Madame replied; and indeed there was nothing\ndreamlike in her tart, dry voice: \"Crystal and I really have dragged Dr.\nScott away from the bedside of innumerable other sick and wounded men,\nand also from any hope of well-earned rest to-night: we have also really\nbrought him to a spot very accurately described by our worthy friend,\nSt. Genis, but where, unfortunately, you had not chosen to remain, else\nwe had found you an hour sooner. Is there anything else you want to\nknow?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! Madame la Duchesse, many things,\" murmured Bobby. \"Please go\non telling me.\"\n\nMadame laughed: \"Well!\" she said, \"perhaps you would like to know that\nsome kind of instinct, or perhaps the hand of God guided one of our\nparty to the place where you had gone to sleep. You may also wish to\nknow, that though you seem in a bad way for the present, you are going\nto be nursed back to life under Dr. Scott's own most hospitable roof:\nbut since Crystal has undertaken to do the nursing, I imagine that my\ntime for the next six weeks will be taken up in arguing with my dear and\npompous brother that he will now have to give his consent to his\ndaughter becoming the wife of a vendor of gloves.\"\n\nBobby contrived to smile: \"Do you think that if I promised never to buy\nor sell gloves again, but in future to try and live like a gentleman--do\nyou think then that he will consent?\"\n\n\"I think, my dear boy,\" said Madame, subduing her harsh voice to tones\nof gentleness, \"that after my brother knows all that I know and all that\nhis daughter desires, he will be proud to welcome you as his son.\"\n\nThe doctor's wide barouche lumbered slowly along the wide, straight\nroad. In the east the luminous veil that still hid the rising sun had\ntaken on a hue of rosy gold: the birds, now fully awake, sang their\nmorning hymn. From the direction of Wavre came once more the cannon's\nroar.\n\nInside the carriage Dr. Scott, sitting at the feet of his patient, gave\na peremptory order for silence. But Bobby--immeasurably happy and\ncontented--looked up and saw Crystal de Cambray--no longer a girl now,\nbut a fair and beautiful woman who had learned to the last letter the\nfulsome lesson of Love. She sat close beside him, and her arm was round\nhis reclining head, and, looking at her, he saw the lovelight in her\ndear eyes whenever she turned them on him. And anon, when Mme. la\nDuchesse engaged Dr. Scott in a close and heated argument, Bobby felt\nsweet-scented lips pressed against his own.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\n\nTranscriber's note:\n\nThe original text is inconsistent regarding the spelling and\nhyphenation of some words.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n","id":928,"split":"train"}
