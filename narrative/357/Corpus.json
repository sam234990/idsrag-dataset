It tells the story of Georges Duroy, who has spent three years in military service in Algeria. After working for six months as a clerk in Paris, an encounter with his former comrade, Forestier, enables him to start a career as a journalist. From a reporter of minor events and soft news, he gradually climbs his way up to chief editor. Duroy initially owes his success to Forestier\u2019s wife, Madeleine, who helps him write his first articles and, when he later starts writing lead articles, she adds an edge and poignancy to them. At the same time, she uses her connections among leading politicians to provide him with behind the scenes information which allows him to become actively involved in politics. Duroy is also introduced to many politicians in Madame Forestier\u2019s drawing-room. Duroy becomes the lover of Forestiers' friend Mme de Marelle, another influential woman. Duroy later tries to seduce Madeleine Forestier to get even with her husband, but she repulses Duroy\u2019s sexual advances and offers that they become true friends without ulterior motives.\nIn a few months, Charles Forestier\u2019s health deteriorates and he travels to the south of France to regain it. Soon afterwards, Duroy receives a letter from Madeleine imploring him to join her and help her bear the last moments of her husband\u2019s life. When Forestier dies, Duroy asks Madeleine to marry him. After a few weeks to consider, she agrees. Georges now signs his articles Du Roy (an aristocratic style of French name) in order to add prestige to his name. The married couple travels to Normandy, the region of Georges\u2019s childhood, and meets his peasant parents. Finding the reality different from her romantic expectations, Madeleine feels very uncomfortable with his parents and so their stay with them is short. In the newspaper office, Duroy is ridiculed for having his articles written by his wife, just as the late Forestier had his articles written by her. His newspaper colleagues call him \u2018Forestier\u2019, which drives Georges mad and he becomes heavily jealous of Madeleine, insisting that she admit having been unfaithful to Forestier, but she never does.\nIn order to suppress the stings of jealousy, Duroy starts an affair with Mme Walter, the wife of the owner of the newspaper. He especially enjoys the conquest as he is her first extramarital lover. Later on, however, he regrets the decision, for he cannot get rid of her when he does not want her. Duroy\u2019s relations with his wife become estranged; at one point, he takes a police superintendent and three other police officers to a flat in which his wife is meeting Monsieur Laroche-Mathieu, her lover. They catch the two in the act of adultery, which was then a crime punishable under the law. Duroy used the police as witnesses of his wife's adultery to facilitate their divorce. He did not have her or her lover arrested although the police gave him the option to do so.\nIn the last two chapters, Duroy's ascent to power continues. Duroy, now a single man, makes use of his chief\u2019s daughter's infatuation with him, and arranges an elopement with her. The parents then have no other choice but to grant their assent to the marriage. The last chapter shows Duroy savouring his success at the wedding ceremony at which 'all those who figured prominently in society' are present. His thoughts, however, chiefly belong to Mme de Marelle who, when wishing him all the best, indicates that she has forgiven him for his new marriage and that their intimate meetings can be taken up again.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Bel Ami, by Henri Rene Guy de Maupassant\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

It was the twenty-eighth of June and he had only three\nfrancs in his pocket to last him the remainder of the month. That meant\ntwo dinners and no lunches, or two lunches and no dinners, according to\nchoice. As he pondered upon this unpleasant state of affairs, he\nsauntered down Rue Notre Dame de Lorette, preserving his military air\nand carriage, and rudely jostled the people upon the streets in order\nto clear a path for himself. He appeared to be hostile to the\npassers-by, and even to the houses, the entire city.\n\nTall, well-built, fair, with blue eyes, a curled mustache, hair\nnaturally wavy and parted in the middle, he recalled the hero of the\npopular romances.\n\nIt was one of those sultry, Parisian evenings when not a breath of air\nis stirring; the sewers exhaled poisonous gases and the restaurants the\ndisagreeable odors of cooking and of kindred smells. Porters in their\nshirt-sleeves, astride their chairs, smoked their pipes at the carriage\ngates, and pedestrians strolled leisurely along, hats in hand.\n\nWhen Georges Duroy reached the boulevard he halted again, undecided as\nto which road to choose. Finally he turned toward the Madeleine and\nfollowed the tide of people.\n\nThe large, well-patronized cafes tempted Duroy, but were he to drink\nonly two glasses of beer in an evening, farewell to the meager supper\nthe following night! Yet he said to himself: \"I will take a glass at\nthe Americain. By Jove, I am thirsty.\"\n\nHe glanced at men seated at the tables, men who could afford to slake\ntheir thirst, and he scowled at them. \"Rascals!\" he muttered. If he\ncould have caught one of them at a corner in the dark he would have\nchoked him without a scruple! He recalled the two years spent in\nAfrica, and the manner in which he had extorted money from the Arabs. A\nsmile hovered about his lips at the recollection of an escapade which\nhad cost three men their lives, a foray which had given his two\ncomrades and himself seventy fowls, two sheep, money, and something to\nlaugh about for six months. The culprits were never found; indeed, they\nwere not sought for, the Arab being looked upon as the soldier's prey.\n\nBut in Paris it was different; there one could not commit such deeds\nwith impunity. He regretted that he had not remained where he was; but\nhe had hoped to improve his condition--and for that reason he was in\nParis!\n\nHe passed the Vaudeville and stopped at the Cafe Americain, debating as\nto whether he should take that \"glass.\" Before deciding, he glanced at\na clock; it was a quarter past nine. He knew that when the beer was\nplaced in front of him, he would drink it; and then what would he do at\neleven o'clock? So he walked on, intending to go as far as the\nMadeleine and return.\n\nWhen he reached the Place de l'Opera, a tall, young man passed him,\nwhose face he fancied was familiar. He followed him, repeating: \"Where\nthe deuce have I seen that fellow?\"\n\nFor a time he racked his brain in vain; then suddenly he saw the same\nman, but not so corpulent and more youthful, attired in the uniform of\na Hussar. He exclaimed: \"Wait, Forestier!\" and hastening up to him,\nlaid his hand upon the man's shoulder. The latter turned, looked at\nhim, and said: \"What do you want, sir?\"\n\nDuroy began to laugh: \"Don't you remember me?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Not remember Georges Duroy of the Sixth Hussars.\"\n\nForestier extended both hands.\n\n\"Ah, my dear fellow, how are you?\"\n\n\"Very well. And how are you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I am not very well. I cough six months out of the twelve as a\nresult of bronchitis contracted at Bougival, about the time of my\nreturn to Paris four years ago.\"\n\n\"But you look well.\"\n\nForestier, taking his former comrade's arm, told him of his malady, of\nthe consultations, the opinions and the advice of the doctors and of\nthe difficulty of following their advice in his position. They ordered\nhim to spend the winter in the south, but how could he? He was married\nand was a journalist in a responsible editorial position.\n\n\"I manage the political department on 'La Vie Francaise'; I report the\ndoings of the Senate for 'Le Salut,' and from time to time I write for\n'La Planete.' That is what I am doing.\"\n\nDuroy, in surprise, glanced at him. He was very much changed. Formerly\nForestier had been thin, giddy, noisy, and always in good spirits. But\nthree years of life in Paris had made another man of him; now he was\nstout and serious, and his hair was gray on his temples although he\ncould not number more than twenty-seven years.\n\nForestier asked: \"Where are you going?\"\n\nDuroy replied: \"Nowhere in particular.\"\n\n\"Very well, will you accompany me to the 'Vie Francaise' where I have\nsome proofs to correct; and afterward take a drink with me?\"\n\n\"Yes, gladly.\"\n\nThey walked along arm-in-arm with that familiarity which exists between\nschoolmates and brother-officers.\n\n\"What are you doing in Paris?\" asked Forestier, Duroy shrugged his\nshoulders.\n\n\"Dying of hunger, simply. When my time was up, I came hither to make my\nfortune, or rather to live in Paris--and for six months I have been\nemployed in a railroad office at fifteen hundred francs a year.\"\n\nForestier murmured: \"That is not very much.\"\n\n\"But what can I do?\" answered Duroy. \"I am alone, I know no one, I have\nno recommendations. The spirit is not lacking, but the means are.\"\n\nHis companion looked at him from head to foot like a practical man who\nis examining a subject; then he said, in a tone of conviction: \"You\nsee, my dear fellow, all depends on assurance, here. A shrewd,\nobserving man can sometimes become a minister. You must obtrude\nyourself and yet not ask anything. But how is it you have not found\nanything better than a clerkship at the station?\"\n\nDuroy replied: \"I hunted everywhere and found nothing else. But I know\nwhere I can get three thousand francs at least--as riding-master at the\nPellerin school.\"\n\nForestier stopped him: \"Don't do it, for you can earn ten thousand\nfrancs. You will ruin your prospects at once. In your office at least\nno one knows you; you can leave it if you wish to at any time. But when\nyou are once a riding-master all will be over. You might as well be a\nbutler in a house to which all Paris comes to dine. When you have given\nriding lessons to men of the world or to their sons, they will no\nlonger consider you their equal.\"\n\nHe paused, reflected several seconds and then asked:\n\n\"Are you a bachelor?\"\n\n\"Yes, though I have been smitten several times.\"\n\n\"That makes no difference. If Cicero and Tiberius were mentioned would\nyou know who they were?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good, no one knows any more except about a score of fools. It is not\ndifficult to pass for being learned. The secret is not to betray your\nignorance. Just maneuver, avoid the quicksands and obstacles, and the\nrest can be found in a dictionary.\"\n\nHe spoke like one who understood human nature, and he smiled as the\ncrowd passed them by. Suddenly he began to cough and stopped to allow\nthe paroxysm to spend itself; then he said in a discouraged tone:\n\n\"Isn't it tiresome not to be able to get rid of this bronchitis? And\nhere is midsummer! This winter I shall go to Mentone. Health before\neverything.\"\n\nThey reached the Boulevarde Poissoniere; behind a large glass door an\nopen paper was affixed; three people were reading it. Above the door\nwas printed the legend, \"La Vie Francaise.\"\n\nForestier pushed open the door and said: \"Come in.\" Duroy entered; they\nascended the stairs, passed through an antechamber in which two clerks\ngreeted their comrade, and then entered a kind of waiting-room.\n\n\"Sit down,\" said Forestier, \"I shall be back in five minutes,\" and he\ndisappeared.\n\nDuroy remained where he was; from time to time men passed him by,\nentering by one door and going out by another before he had time to\nglance at them.\n\nNow they were young men, very young, with a busy air, holding sheets of\npaper in their hands; now compositors, their shirts spotted with\nink--carefully carrying what were evidently fresh proofs. Occasionally\na gentleman entered, fashionably dressed, some reporter bringing news.\n\nForestier reappeared arm-in-arm with a tall, thin man of thirty or\nforty, dressed in a black coat, with a white cravat, a dark complexion,\nand an insolent, self-satisfied air. Forestier said to him: \"Adieu, my\ndear sir,\" and the other pressed his hand with: \"Au revoir, my friend.\"\nThen he descended the stairs whistling, his cane under his arm.\n\nDuroy asked his name.\n\n\"That is Jacques Rival, the celebrated writer and duelist. He came to\ncorrect his proofs. Garin, Montel and he are the best witty and\nrealistic writers we have in Paris. He earns thirty thousand francs a\nyear for two articles a week.\"\n\nAs they went downstairs, they met a stout, little man with long hair,\nwho was ascending the stairs whistling. Forestier bowed low.\n\n\"Norbert de Varenne,\" said he, \"the poet, the author of 'Les Soleils\nMorts,'--a very expensive man. Every poem he gives us costs three\nhundred francs and the longest has not two hundred lines. But let us go\ninto the Napolitain, I am getting thirsty.\"\n\nWhen they were seated at a table, Forestier ordered two glasses of\nbeer. He emptied his at a single draught, while Duroy sipped his beer\nslowly as if it were something rare and precious. Suddenly his\ncompanion asked, \"Why don't you try journalism?\"\n\nDuroy looked at him in surprise and said: \"Because I have never written\nanything.\"\n\n\"Bah, we all have to make a beginning. I could employ you myself by\nsending you to obtain information. At first you would only get two\nhundred and fifty francs a month but your cab fare would be paid. Shall\nI speak to the manager?\"\n\n\"If you will.\"\n\n\"Well, then come and dine with me to-morrow; I will only ask five or\nsix to meet you; the manager, M. Walter, his wife, with Jacques Rival,\nand Norbert de Varenne whom you have just seen, and also a friend of\nMme. Forestier, Will you come?\"\n\nDuroy hesitated, blushing and perplexed. Finally he, murmured: \"I have\nno suitable clothes.\"\n\nForestier was amazed. \"You have no dress suit? Egad, that is\nindispensable. In Paris, it is better to have no bed than no clothes.\"\nThen, fumbling in his vest-pocket, he drew from it two louis, placed\nthem before his companion, and said kindly: \"You can repay me when it\nis convenient. Buy yourself what you need and pay an installment on it.\nAnd come and dine with us at half past seven, at 17 Rue Fontaine.\"\n\nIn confusion Duroy picked up the money and stammered: \"You are very\nkind--I am much obliged--be sure I shall not forget.\"\n\nForestier interrupted him: \"That's all right, take another glass of\nbeer. Waiter, two more glasses!\" When he had paid the score, the\njournalist asked: \"Would you like a stroll for an hour?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nThey turned toward the Madeleine. \"What shall we do?\" asked Forestier.\n\"They say that in Paris an idler can always find amusement, but it is\nnot true. A turn in the Bois is only enjoyable if you have a lady with\nyou, and that is a rare occurrence. The cafe concerts may divert my\ntailor and his wife, but they do not interest me. So what can we do?\nNothing! There ought to be a summer garden here, open at night, where a\nman could listen to good music while drinking beneath the trees. It\nwould be a pleasant lounging place. You could walk in alleys bright\nwith electric light and seat yourself where you pleased to hear the\nmusic. It would be charming. Where would you like to go?\"\n\nDuroy did not know what to reply; finally he said: \"I have never been\nto the Folies Bergeres. I should like to go there.\"\n\nHis companion exclaimed: \"The Folies Bergeres! Very well!\"\n\nThey turned and walked toward the Faubourg Montmartre. The brilliantly\nilluminated building loomed up before them. Forestier entered, Duroy\nstopped him. \"We forgot to pass through the gate.\"\n\nThe other replied in a consequential tone: \"I never pay,\" and\napproached the box-office.\n\n\"Have you a good box?\"\n\n\"Certainly, M. Forestier.\"\n\nHe took the ticket handed him, pushed open the door, and they were\nwithin the hall. A cloud of tobacco smoke almost hid the stage and the\nopposite side of the theater. In the spacious foyer which led to the\ncircular promenade, brilliantly dressed women mingled with black-coated\nmen.\n\nForestier forced his way rapidly through the throng and accosted an\nusher.\n\n\"Box 17?\"\n\n\"This way, sir.\"\n\nThe friends were shown into a tiny box, hung and carpeted in red, with\nfour chairs upholstered in the same color. They seated themselves. To\ntheir right and left were similar boxes. On the stage three men were\nperforming on trapezes. But Duroy paid no heed to them, his eyes\nfinding more to interest them in the grand promenade. Forestier\nremarked upon the motley appearance of the throng, but Duroy did not\nlisten to him. A woman, leaning her arms upon the edge of her loge, was\nstaring at him. She was a tall, voluptuous brunette, her face whitened\nwith enamel, her black eyes penciled, and her lips painted. With a\nmovement of her head, she summoned a friend who was passing, a blonde\nwith auburn hair, likewise inclined to embonpoint, and said to her in a\nwhisper intended to be heard; \"There is a nice fellow!\"\n\nForestier heard it, and said to Duroy with a smile: \"You are lucky, my\ndear boy. My congratulations!\"\n\nThe ci-devant soldier blushed and mechanically fingered the two pieces\nof gold in his pocket.\n\nThe curtain fell--the orchestra played a valse--and Duroy said:\n\n\"Shall we walk around the gallery?\"\n\n\"If you like.\"\n\nSoon they were carried along in the current of promenaders. Duroy drank\nin with delight the air, vitiated as it was by tobacco and cheap\nperfume, but Forestier perspired, panted, and coughed.\n\n\"Let us go into the garden,\" he said. Turning to the left, they entered\na kind of covered garden in which two large fountains were playing.\nUnder the yews, men and women sat at tables drinking.\n\n\"Another glass of beer?\" asked Forestier.\n\n\"Gladly.\"\n\nThey took their seats and watched the promenaders. Occasionally a woman\nwould stop and ask with a coarse smile: \"What have you to offer, sir?\"\n\nForestier's invariable answer was: \"A glass of water from the\nfountain.\" And the woman would mutter, \"Go along,\" and walk away.\n\nAt last the brunette reappeared, arm-in-arm with the blonde. They made\na handsome couple. The former smiled on perceiving Duroy, and taking a\nchair she calmly seated herself in front of him, and said in a clear\nvoice: \"Waiter, two glasses.\"\n\nIn astonishment, Forestier exclaimed: \"You are not at all bashful!\"\n\nShe replied: \"Your friend has bewitched me; he is such a fine fellow. I\nbelieve he has turned my head.\"\n\nDuroy said nothing.\n\nThe waiter brought the beer, which the women swallowed rapidly; then\nthey rose, and the brunette, nodding her head and tapping Duroy's arm\nwith her fan, said to him: \"Thank you, my dear! However, you are not\nvery talkative.\"\n\nAs they disappeared, Forestier laughed and said: \"Tell, me, old man,\ndid you know that you had a charm for the weaker sex? You must be\ncareful.\"\n\nWithout replying, Duroy smiled. His friend asked: \"Shall you remain any\nlonger? I am going; I have had enough.\"\n\nGeorges murmured: \"Yes, I will stay a little longer: it is not late.\"\n\nForestier arose: \"Very well, then, good-bye until to-morrow. Do not\nforget: 17 Rue Fontaine at seven thirty.\"\n\n\"I shall not forget. Thank you.\"\n\nThe friends shook hands and the journalist left Duroy to his own\ndevices.\n\nForestier once out of sight, Duroy felt free, and again he joyously\ntouched the gold pieces in his pocket; then rising, he mingled with the\ncrowd.\n\nHe soon discovered the blonde and the brunette. He went toward them,\nbut when near them dared not address them.\n\nThe brunette called out to him: \"Have you found your tongue?\"\n\nHe stammered: \"Zounds!\" too bashful to say another word. A pause\nensued, during which the brunette took his arm and together they left\nthe hall.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nMADAME FORESTIER\n\n\n\"Where does M. Forestier live?\"\n\n\"Third floor on the left,\" said the porter pleasantly, on learning\nDuroy's destination.\n\nGeorges ascended the staircase. He was somewhat embarrassed and\nill-at-ease. He had on a new suit but he was uncomfortable. He felt\nthat it was defective; his boots were not glossy, he had bought his\nshirt that same evening at the Louvre for four francs fifty, his\ntrousers were too wide and betrayed their cheapness in their fit, or\nrather, misfit, and his coat was too tight.\n\nSlowly he ascended the stairs, his heart beating, his mind anxious.\nSuddenly before him stood a well-dressed gentleman staring at him. The\nperson resembled Duroy so close that the latter retreated, then\nstopped, and saw that it was his own image reflected in a pier-glass!\nNot having anything but a small mirror at home, he had not been able to\nsee himself entirely, and had exaggerated the imperfections of his\ntoilette. When he saw his reflection in the glass, he did not even\nrecognize himself; he took himself for some one else, for a\nman-of-the-world, and was really satisfied with his general appearance.\nSmiling to himself, Duroy extended his hand and expressed his\nastonishment, pleasure, and approbation. A door opened on the\nstaircase, He was afraid of being surprised and began to ascend more\nrapidly, fearing that he might have been seen posing there by some of\nhis friend's invited guests.\n\nOn reaching the second floor, he saw another mirror, and once more\nslackened his pace to look at himself. He likewise paused before the\nthird glass, twirled his mustache, took off his hat to arrange his\nhair, and murmured half aloud, a habit of his: \"Hall mirrors are most\nconvenient.\"\n\nThen he rang the bell. The door opened almost immediately, and before\nhim stood a servant in a black coat, with a grave, shaven face, so\nperfect in his appearance that Duroy again became confused as he\ncompared the cut of their garments.\n\nThe lackey asked:\n\n\"Whom shall I announce, Monsieur?\" He raised a portiere and pronounced\nthe name.\n\nDuroy lost his self-possession upon being ushered into a world as yet\nstrange to him. However, he advanced. A young, fair woman received him\nalone in a large, well-lighted room. He paused, disconcerted. Who was\nthat smiling lady? He remembered that Forestier was married, and the\nthought that the handsome blonde was his friend's wife rendered him\nawkward and ill-at-ease. He stammered out:\n\n\"Madame, I am--\"\n\nShe held out her hand. \"I know, Monsieur--Charles told me of your\nmeeting last night, and I am very glad that he asked you to dine with\nus to-day.\"\n\nDuroy blushed to the roots of his hair, not knowing how to reply; he\nfelt that he was being inspected from his head to his feet. He half\nthought of excusing himself, of inventing an explanation of the\ncarelessness of his toilette, but he did not know how to touch upon\nthat delicate subject.\n\nHe seated himself upon a chair she pointed out to him, and as he sank\ninto its luxurious depths, it seemed to him that he was entering a new\nand charming life, that he would make his mark in the world, that he\nwas saved. He glanced at Mme. Forestier. She wore a gown of pale blue\ncashmere which clung gracefully to her supple form and rounded\noutlines; her arms and throat rose in, lily-white purity from the mass\nof lace which ornamented the corsage and short sleeves. Her hair was\ndressed high and curled on the nape of her neck.\n\nDuroy grew more at his ease under her glance, which recalled to him, he\nknew not why, that of the girl he had met the preceding evening at the\nFolies-Bergeres. Mme. Forestier had gray eyes, a small nose, full lips,\nand a rather heavy chin, an irregular, attractive face, full of\ngentleness and yet of malice.\n\nAfter a short silence, she asked: \"Have you been in Paris a long time?\"\n\nGradually regaining his self-possession, he replied: \"a few months,\nMadame. I am in the railroad employ, but my friend Forestier has\nencouraged me to hope that, thanks to him, I can enter into journalism.\"\n\nShe smiled kindly and murmured in a low voice: \"I know.\"\n\nThe bell rang again and the servant announced: \"Mme. de Marelle.\" She\nwas a dainty brunette, attired in a simple, dark robe; a red rose in\nher black tresses seemed to accentuate her special character, and a\nyoung girl, or rather a child, for such she was, followed her.\n\nMme. Forestier said: \"Good evening, Clotilde.\"\n\n\"Good evening, Madeleine.\"\n\nThey embraced each other, then the child offered her forehead with the\nassurance of an adult, saying:\n\n\"Good evening, cousin.\"\n\nMme. Forestier kissed her, and then made the introductions:\n\n\"M. Georges Duroy, an old friend of Charles. Mme. de Marelle, my\nfriend, a relative in fact.\" She added: \"Here, you know, we do not\nstand on ceremony.\"\n\nDuroy bowed. The door opened again and a short man entered, upon his\narm a tall, handsome woman, taller than he and much younger, with\ndistinguished manners and a dignified carriage. It was M. Walter,\ndeputy, financier, a moneyed man, and a man of business, manager of \"La\nVie Francaise,\" with his wife, nee Basile Ravalade, daughter of the\nbanker of that name.\n\nThen came Jacques Rival, very elegant, followed by Norbert de Varenne.\nThe latter advanced with the grace of the old school and taking Mme.\nForestier's hand kissed it; his long hair falling upon his hostess's\nbare arm as he did so.\n\nForestier now entered, apologizing for being late; he had been detained.\n\nThe servant announced dinner, and they entered the dining-room. Duroy\nwas placed between Mme. de Marelle and her daughter. He was again\nrendered uncomfortable for fear of committing some error in the\nconventional management of his fork, his spoon, or his glasses, of\nwhich he had four. Nothing was said during the soup; then Norbert de\nVarenne asked a general question: \"Have you read the Gauthier case? How\ndroll it was!\"\n\nThen followed a discussion of the subject in which the ladies joined.\nThen a duel was mentioned and Jacques Rival led the conversation; that\nwas his province. Duroy did not venture a remark, but occasionally\nglanced at his neighbor. A diamond upon a slight, golden thread\ndepended from her ear; from time to time she uttered a remark which\nevoked a smile upon his lips. Duroy sought vainly for some compliment\nto pay her; he busied himself with her daughter, filled her glass,\nwaited upon her, and the child, more dignified than her mother, thanked\nhim gravely saying, \"You are very kind, Monsieur,\" while she listened\nto the conversation with a reflective air. The dinner was excellent and\neveryone was delighted with it.\n\nThe conversation returned to the colonization of Algeria. M. Walter\nuttered several jocose remarks; Forestier alluded to the article he had\nprepared for the morrow; Jacques Rival declared himself in favor of a\nmilitary government with grants of land to all the officers after\nthirty years of colonial service.\n\n\"In that way,\" said he, \"you can establish a strong colony, familiar\nwith and liking the country, knowing its language and able to cope with\nall those local yet grave questions which invariably confront\nnewcomers.\"\n\nNorbert de Varenne interrupted: \"Yes, they would know everything,\nexcept agriculture. They would speak Arabic, but they would not know\nhow to transplant beet-root, and how to sow wheat. They would be strong\nin fencing, but weak in the art of farming. On the contrary, the new\ncountry should be opened to everyone. Intelligent men would make\npositions for themselves; the others would succumb. It is a natural\nlaw.\"\n\nA pause ensued. Everyone smiled. Georges Duroy, startled at the sound\nof his own voice, as if he had never heard it, said:\n\n\"What is needed the most down there is good soil. Really fertile land\ncosts as much as it does in France and is bought by wealthy Parisians.\nThe real colonists, the poor, are generally cast out into the desert,\nwhere nothing grows for lack of water.\"\n\nAll eyes turned upon him. He colored. M. Walter asked: \"Do you know\nAlgeria, sir?\"\n\nHe replied: \"Yes, sir, I was there twenty-eight months.\" Leaving the\nsubject of colonization, Norbert de Varenne questioned him as to some\nof the Algerian customs. Georges spoke with animation; excited by the\nwine and the desire to please, he related anecdotes of the regiment, of\nArabian life, and of the war.\n\nMme. Walter murmured to him in her soft tones: \"You could write a\nseries of charming articles.\"\n\nForestier took advantage of the situation to say to M. Walter: \"My dear\nsir, I spoke to you a short while since of M. Georges Duroy and asked\nyou to permit me to include him on the staff of political reporters.\nSince Marambot has left us, I have had no one to take urgent and\nconfidential reports, and the paper is suffering by it.\"\n\nM. Walter put on his spectacles in order to examine Duroy. Then he\nsaid: \"I am convinced that M. Duroy is original, and if he will call\nupon me tomorrow at three o'clock, we will arrange matters.\" After a\npause, turning to the young man, he said: \"You may write us a short\nsketch on Algeria, M. Duroy. Simply relate your experiences; I am sure\nthey will interest our readers. But you must do it quickly.\"\n\nMme. Walter added with her customary, serious grace: \"You will have a\ncharming title: 'Souvenirs of a Soldier in Africa.' Will he not, M.\nNorbert?\"\n\nThe old poet, who had attained renown late in life, disliked and\nmistrusted newcomers. He replied dryly: \"Yes, excellent, provided that\nit is written in the right key, for there lies the great difficulty.\"\n\nMme. Forestier cast upon Duroy a protecting and smiling glance which\nseemed to say: \"You shall succeed.\" The servant filled the glasses with\nwine, and Forestier proposed the toast: \"To the long prosperity of 'La\nVie Francaise.'\" Duroy felt superhuman strength within him, infinite\nhope, and invincible resolution. He was at his ease now among these\npeople; his eyes rested upon their faces with renewed assurance, and\nfor the first time he ventured to address his neighbor:\n\n\"You have the most beautiful earrings I have ever seen.\"\n\nShe turned toward him with a smile: \"It is a fancy of mine to wear\ndiamonds like this, simply on a thread.\"\n\nHe murmured in reply, trembling at his audacity: \"It is charming--but\nthe ear increases the beauty of the ornament.\"\n\nShe thanked him with a glance. As he turned his head, he met Mme.\nForestier's eyes, in which he fancied he saw a mingled expression of\ngaiety, malice, and encouragement. All the men were talking at the same\ntime; their discussion was animated.\n\nWhen the party left the dining-room, Duroy offered his arm to the\nlittle girl. She thanked him gravely and stood upon tiptoe in order to\nlay her hand upon his arm. Upon entering the drawing-room, the young\nman carefully surveyed it. It was not a large room; but there were no\nbright colors, and one felt at ease; it was restful. The walls were\ndraped with violet hangings covered with tiny embroidered flowers of\nyellow silk. The portieres were of a grayish blue and the chairs were\nof all shapes, of all sizes; scattered about the room were couches and\nlarge and small easy-chairs, all covered with Louis XVI. brocade, or\nUtrecht velvet, a cream colored ground with garnet flowers.\n\n\"Do you take coffee, M. Duroy?\" Mme. Forestier offered him a cup, with\nthe smile that was always upon her lips.\n\n\"Yes, Madame, thank you.\" He took the cup, and as he did so, the young\nwoman whispered to him: \"Pay Mme. Walter some attention.\" Then she\nvanished before he could reply.\n\nFirst he drank his coffee, which he feared he should let fall upon the\ncarpet; then he sought a pretext for approaching the manager's wife and\ncommencing a conversation. Suddenly he perceived that she held an empty\ncup in her hand, and as she was not near a table, she did not know\nwhere to put it. He rushed toward her:\n\n\"Allow me, Madame.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\nHe took away the cup and returned: \"If you, but knew, Madame, what\npleasant moments 'La Vie Francaise' afforded me, when I was in the\ndesert! It is indeed the only paper one cares to read outside of\nFrance; it contains everything.\"\n\nShe smiled with amiable indifference as she replied: \"M. Walter had a\ngreat deal of trouble in producing the kind of journal which was\nrequired.\"\n\nThey talked of Paris, the suburbs, the Seine, the delights of summer,\nof everything they could think of. Finally M. Norbert de Varenne\nadvanced, a glass of liqueur in his hand, and Duroy discreetly\nwithdrew. Mme. de Marelle, who was chatting with her hostess, called\nhim: \"So, sir,\" she said bluntly, \"you are going to try journalism?\"\nThat question led to a renewal of the interrupted conversation with\nMme. Walter. In her turn Mme. de Marelle related anecdotes, and\nbecoming familiar, laid her hand upon Duroy's arm. He felt that he\nwould like to devote himself to her, to protect her--and the slowness\nwith which he replied to her questions indicated his preoccupation.\nSuddenly, without any cause, Mme. de Marelle called: \"Laurine!\" and the\ngirl came to her. \"Sit down here, my child, you will be cold near the\nwindow.\"\n\nDuroy was seized with an eager desire to embrace the child, as if part\nof that embrace would revert to the mother. He asked in a gallant, yet\npaternal tone: \"Will you permit me to kiss you, Mademoiselle?\" The\nchild raised her eyes with an air of surprise. Mme. de Marelle said\nwith a smile: \"Reply.\"\n\n\"I will allow you to-day, Monsieur, but not all the time.\"\n\nSeating himself, Duroy took Laurine upon his knee, and kissed her lips\nand her fine wavy hair. Her mother was surprised: \"Well, that is\nstrange! Ordinarily she only allows ladies to caress her. You are\nirresistible, Monsieur!\"\n\nDuroy colored, but did not reply.\n\nWhen Mme. Forestier joined them, a cry of astonishment escaped her:\n\"Well, Laurine has become sociable; what a miracle!\"\n\nThe young man rose to take his leave, fearing he might spoil his\nconquest by some awkward word. He bowed to the ladies, clasped and\ngently pressed their hands, and then shook hands with the men. He\nobserved that Jacques Rival's was dry and warm and responded cordially\nto his pressure; Norbert de Varenne's was moist and cold and slipped\nthrough his fingers; Walter's was cold and soft, without life,\nexpressionless; Forestier's fat and warm.\n\nHis friend whispered to him: \"To-morrow at three o'clock; do not\nforget.\"\n\n\"Never fear!\"\n\nWhen he reached the staircase, he felt like running down, his joy was\nso great; he went down two steps at a time, but suddenly on the second\nfloor, in the large mirror, he saw a gentleman hurrying on, and he\nslackened his pace, as much ashamed as if he had been surprised in a\ncrime.\n\nHe surveyed himself some time with a complacent smile; then taking\nleave of his image, he bowed low, ceremoniously, as if saluting some\ngrand personage.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nFIRST ATTEMPTS\n\n\nWhen Georges Duroy reached the street, he hesitated as to what he\nshould do. He felt inclined to stroll along, dreaming of the future and\ninhaling the soft night air; but the thought of the series of articles\nordered by M. Walter occurred to him, and he decided to return home at\nonce and begin work. He walked rapidly along until he came to Rue\nBoursault. The tenement in which he lived was occupied by twenty\nfamilies--families of workingmen--and as he mounted the staircase he\nexperienced a sensation of disgust and a desire to live as wealthy men\ndo. Duroy's room was on the fifth floor. He entered it, opened his\nwindow, and looked out: the view was anything but prepossessing.\n\nHe turned away, thinking: \"This won't do. I must go to work.\" So he\nplaced his light upon the table and began to write. He dipped his pen\ninto the ink and wrote at the head of his paper in a bold hand:\n\"Souvenirs of a Soldier in Africa.\" Then he cast about for the first\nphrase. He rested his head upon his hand and stared at the blank sheet\nbefore him. What should he say? Suddenly he thought: \"I must begin with\nmy departure,\" and he wrote: \"In 1874, about the fifteenth of May, when\nexhausted France was recruiting after the catastrophe of the terrible\nyears--\" Here he stopped short, not knowing how to introduce his\nsubject. After a few minutes' reflection, he decided to lay aside that\npage until the following day, and to write a description of Algiers. He\nbegan: \"Algiers is a very clean city--\" but he could not continue.\nAfter an effort he added: \"It is inhabited partly by Arabs.\" Then he\nthrew his pen upon the table and arose. He glanced around his miserable\nroom; mentally he rebelled against his poverty and resolved to leave\nthe next day.\n\nSuddenly the desire to work came on him, and he tried to begin the\narticle again; he had vague ideas of what he wanted to say, but he\ncould not express his thoughts in words. Convinced of his inability he\narose once more, his blood coursing rapidly through his veins. He\nturned to the window just as the train was coming out of the tunnel,\nand his thoughts reverted to his parents. He saw their tiny home on the\nheights overlooking Rouen and the valley of the Seine. His father and\nmother kept an inn, La Belle-Vue, at which the citizens of the\nfaubourgs took their lunches on Sundays. They had wished to make a\n\"gentleman\" of their son and had sent him to college. His studies\ncompleted, he had entered the army with the intention of becoming an\nofficer, a colonel, or a general. But becoming disgusted with military\nlife, he determined to try his fortune in Paris. When his time of\nservice had expired, he went thither, with what results we have seen.\nHe awoke from his reflections as the locomotive whistled shrilly,\nclosed his window, and began to disrobe, muttering: \"Bah, I shall be\nable to work better to-morrow morning. My brain is not clear to-night.\nI have drunk a little too much. I can't work well under such\ncircumstances.\" He extinguished his light and fell asleep.\n\nHe awoke early, and, rising, opened his window to inhale the fresh air.\nIn a few moments he seated himself at his table, dipped his pen in the\nink, rested his head upon his hand and thought--but in vain! However,\nhe was not discouraged, but in thought reassured himself: \"Bah, I am\nnot accustomed to it! It is a profession that must be learned like all\nprofessions. Some one must help me the first time. I'll go to\nForestier. He'll start my article for me in ten minutes.\"\n\nWhen he reached the street, Duroy decided that it was rather early to\npresent himself at his friend's house, so he strolled along under the\ntrees on one of the boulevards for a time. On arriving at Forestier's\ndoor, he found his friend going out.\n\n\"You here--at this hour! Can I do anything for you?\"\n\nDuroy stammered in confusion: \"I--I--cannot write that article on\nAlgeria that M. Walter wants. It is not very surprising, seeing that I\nhave never written anything. It requires practice. I could write very\nrapidly, I am sure, if I could make a beginning. I have the ideas but I\ncannot express them.\" He paused and hesitated.\n\nForestier smiled maliciously: \"I understand that.\"\n\nDuroy continued: \"Yes, anyone is liable to have that trouble at the\nbeginning; and, well--I have come to ask you to help me. In ten minutes\nyou can set me right. You can give me a lesson in style; without you I\ncan do nothing.\"\n\nThe other smiled gaily. He patted his companion's arm and said to him:\n\"Go to my wife; she will help you better than I can. I have trained her\nfor that work. I have not time this morning or I would do it willingly.\"\n\nBut Duroy hesitated: \"At this hour I cannot inquire for her.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you can; she has risen. You will find her in my study.\"\n\n\"I will go, but I shall tell her you sent me!\"\n\nForestier walked away, and Duroy slowly ascended the stairs, wondering\nwhat he should say and what kind of a reception he would receive.\n\nThe servant who opened the door said: \"Monsieur has gone out.\"\n\nDuroy replied: \"Ask Mme. Forestier if she will see me, and tell her\nthat M. Forestier, whom I met on the street, sent me.\"\n\nThe lackey soon returned and ushered Duroy into Madame's presence. She\nwas seated at a table and extended her hand to him.\n\n\"So soon?\" said she. It was not a reproach, but a simple question.\n\nHe stammered: \"I did not want to come up, Madame, but your husband,\nwhom I met below, insisted--I dare scarcely tell you my errand--I\nworked late last night and early this morning, to write the article on\nAlgeria which M. Walter wants--and I did not succeed--I destroyed all\nmy attempts--I am not accustomed to the work--and I came to ask\nForestier to assist me--his once.\"\n\nShe interrupted with a laugh: \"And he sent you to me?\"\n\n\"Yes, Madame. He said you could help me better than he--but--I dared\nnot--I did not like to.\"\n\nShe rose.\n\n\"It will be delightful to work together that way. I am charmed with\nyour idea. Wait, take my chair, for they know my handwriting on the\npaper--we will write a successful article.\"\n\nShe took a cigarette from the mantelpiece and lighted it. \"I cannot\nwork without smoking,\" she said; \"what are you going to say?\"\n\nHe looked at her in astonishment. \"I do not know; I came here to find\nthat out.\"\n\nShe replied: \"I will manage it all right. I will make the sauce but I\nmust have the dish.\" She questioned him in detail and finally said:\n\n\"Now, we will begin. First of all we will suppose that you are\naddressing a friend, which will allow us scope for remarks of all\nkinds. Begin this way: 'My dear Henry, you wish to know something about\nAlgeria; you shall.'\"\n\nThen followed a brilliantly worded description of Algeria and of the\nport of Algiers, an excursion to the province of Oran, a visit to\nSaida, and an adventure with a pretty Spanish maid employed in a\nfactory.\n\nWhen the article was concluded, he could find no words of thanks; he\nwas happy to be near her, grateful for and delighted with their growing\nintimacy. It seemed to him that everything about him was a part of her,\neven to the books upon the shelves. The chairs, the furniture, the\nair--all were permeated with that delightful fragrance peculiar to her.\n\nShe asked bluntly: \"What do you think of my friend Mme. de Marelle?\"\n\n\"I think her very fascinating,\" he said; and he would have liked to\nadd: \"But not as much so as you.\" He had not the courage to do so.\n\nShe continued: \"If you only knew how comical, original, and intelligent\nshe is! She is a true Bohemian. It is for that reason that her husband\nno longer loves her. He only sees her defects and none of her good\nqualities.\"\n\nDuroy was surprised to hear that Mme. de Marelle was married.\n\n\"What,\" he asked, \"is she married? What does her husband do?\"\n\nMme. Forestier shrugged her shoulders. \"Oh, he is superintendent of a\nrailroad. He is in Paris a week out of each month. His wife calls it\n'Holy Week.' or 'The week of duty.' When you get better acquainted with\nher, you will see how witty she is! Come here and see her some day.\"\n\nAs she spoke, the door opened noiselessly, and a gentleman entered\nunannounced. He halted on seeing a man. For a moment Mme. Forestier\nseemed confused; then she said in a natural voice, though her cheeks\nwere tinged with a blush:\n\n\"Come in, my dear sir; allow me to present to you an old comrade of\nCharles, M. Georges Duroy, a future journalist.\" Then in a different\ntone, she said: \"Our best and dearest friend, Count de Vaudrec.\"\n\nThe two men bowed, gazed into one another's eyes, and then Duroy took\nhis leave. Neither tried to detain him.\n\nOn reaching the street he felt sad and uncomfortable. Count de\nVaudrec's face was constantly before him. It seemed to him that the man\nwas displeased at finding him tete-a-tete with Mme. Forestier, though\nwhy he should be, he could not divine.\n\nTo while away the time until three o'clock, he lunched at Duval's, and\nthen lounged along the boulevard. When the clock chimed the hour of his\nappointment, he climbed the stairs leading to the office of \"La Vie\nFrancaise.\"\n\nDuroy asked: \"Is M. Walter in?\"\n\n\"M. Walter is engaged,\" was the reply. \"Will you please take a seat?\"\n\nDuroy waited twenty minutes, then he turned to the clerk and said: \"M.\nWalter had an appointment with me at three o'clock. At any rate, see if\nmy friend M. Forestier is here.\"\n\nHe was conducted along a corridor and ushered into a large room in\nwhich four men were writing at a table. Forestier was standing before\nthe fireplace, smoking a cigarette. After listening to Duroy's story he\nsaid:\n\n\"Come with me; I will take you to M. Walter, or else you might remain\nhere until seven o'clock.\"\n\nThey entered the manager's room. Norbert de Varenne was writing an\narticle, seated in an easychair; Jacques Rival, stretched upon a divan,\nwas smoking a cigar. The room had the peculiar odor familiar to all\njournalists. When they approached M. Walter, Forestier said: \"Here is\nmy friend Duroy.\"\n\nThe manager looked keenly at the young man and asked:\n\n\"Have you brought my article?\"\n\nDuroy drew the sheets of manuscript from his pocket.\n\n\"Here they are, Monsieur.\"\n\nThe manager seemed delighted and said with a smile: \"Very good. You are\na man of your word. Need I look over it, Forestier?\"\n\nBut Forestier hastened to reply: \"It is not necessary, M. Walter; I\nhelped him in order to initiate him into the profession. It is very\ngood.\" Then bending toward him, he whispered: \"You know you promised to\nengage Duroy to replace Marambot. Will you allow me to retain him on\nthe same terms?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nTaking his friend's arm, the journalist drew him away, while M. Walter\nreturned to the game of ecarte he had been engaged in when they\nentered. Forestier and Duroy returned to the room in which Georges had\nfound his friend. The latter said to his new reporter:\n\n\"You must come here every day at three o'clock, and I will tell you\nwhat places to go to. First of all, I shall give you a letter of\nintroduction to the chief of the police, who will in turn introduce you\nto one of his employees. You can arrange with him for all important\nnews, official and semiofficial. For details you can apply to\nSaint-Potin, who is posted; you will see him to-morrow. Above all, you\nmust learn to make your way everywhere in spite of closed doors. You\nwill receive two hundred francs a months, two sous a line for original\nmatter, and two sous a line for articles you are ordered to write on\ndifferent subjects.\"\n\n\"What shall I do to-day?\" asked Duroy.\n\n\"I have no work for you to-day; you can go if you wish to.\"\n\n\"And our--our article?\"\n\n\"Oh, do not worry about it; I will correct the proofs. Do the rest\nto-morrow and come here at three o'clock as you did to-day.\"\n\nAnd after shaking hands, Duroy descended the staircase with a light\nheart.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nDUROY LEARNS SOMETHING\n\n\nGeorges Duroy did not sleep well, so anxious was he to see his article\nin print. He rose at daybreak, and was on the street long before the\nnewsboys. When he secured a paper and saw his name at the end of a\ncolumn in large letters, he became very much excited. He felt inclined\nto enact the part of a newsboy and cry out to the hurrying throng: \"Buy\nthis! it contains an article by me!\" He strolled along to a cafe and\nseated himself in order to read the article through; that done he\ndecided to go to the railroad office, draw his salary, and hand in his\nresignation.\n\nWith great pomposity he informed the chief clerk that he was on the\nstaff of \"La Vie Francaise,\" and by that means was avenged for many\npetty insults which had been offered him. He then had some cards\nwritten with his new calling beneath his name, made several purchases,\nand repaired to the office of \"La Vie Francaise.\" Forestier received\nhim loftily as one would an inferior.\n\n\"Ah, here you are! Very well; I have several things for you to do. Just\nwait ten minutes till I finish this work.\" He continued writing.\n\nAt the other end of the table sat a short, pale man, very stout and\nbald. Forestier asked him, when his letter was completed, \"Saint-Potin,\nat what time shall you interview those people?\"\n\n\"At four o'clock.\"\n\n\"Take Duroy, who is here, with you and initiate him into the business.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\nThen turning to his friend, Forestier added: \"Have you brought the\nother paper on Algeria? The article this morning was very successful.\"\n\nDuroy stammered: \"No, I thought I should have time this afternoon. I\nhad so much to do--I could not.\"\n\nThe other shrugged his shoulders. \"If you are not more careful, you\nwill spoil your future. M. Walter counted on your copy. I will tell him\nit will be ready to-morrow. If you think you will be paid for doing\nnothing, you are mistaken.\" After a pause, he added: \"You should strike\nwhile the iron is hot.\"\n\nSaint-Potin rose: \"I am ready,\" said he.\n\nForestier turned around in his chair and said, to Duroy: \"Listen. The\nChinese general Li-Theng-Fao, stopping at the Continental, and Rajah\nTaposahib Ramaderao Pali, stopping at Hotel Bishop, have been in Paris\ntwo days. You must interview them.\" Addressing Saint-Potin, he said:\n\"Do not forget the principal points I indicated to you. Ask the general\nand the rajah their opinions on the dealings of England in the extreme\nEast, their ideas of their system of colonization and government, their\nhopes relative to the intervention of Europe and of France in\nparticular.\" To Duroy he said: \"Observe what Saint-Potin says; he is an\nexcellent reporter, and try to learn how to draw out a man in five\nminutes.\" Then he resumed his work.\n\nThe two men walked down the boulevard together, while Saint-Potin gave\nDuroy a sketch of all the officials connected with the paper, sparing\nno one in his criticism. When he mentioned Forestier, he said: \"As for\nhim, he was fortunate in marrying his wife.\"\n\nDuroy asked: \"What about his wife?\"\n\nSaint-Potin rubbed his hands. \"Oh, she is beloved by an old fellow\nnamed Vaudrec--he dotes upon her.\"\n\nDuroy felt as if he would like to box Saint-Potin's ears. To change the\nsubject he said: \"It seems to me that it is late, and we have two noble\nlords to call upon!\"\n\nSaint-Potin laughed: \"You are very innocent! Do you think that I am\ngoing to interview that Chinese and that Indian? As if I did not know\nbetter than they do what they should think to please the readers of 'La\nVie Francaise'! I have interviewed five hundred Chinese, Prussians,\nHindoos, Chilians, and Japanese. They all say the same thing. I need\nonly copy my article on the last comer, word for word, changing the\nheading, names, titles, and ages: in that there must be no error, or I\nshall be hauled over the coals by the 'Figaro' or 'Gaulois.' But on\nthat subject the porter of the hotels will post me in five minutes. We\nwill smoke our cigars and stroll in that direction. Total--one hundred\nsous for cabfare. That is the way, my dear fellow.\"\n\nWhen they arrived at the Madeleine, Saint-Potin said to his companion:\n\"If you have anything to do, I do not need you.\"\n\nDuroy shook hands with him and walked away. The thought of the article\nhe had to write that evening haunted him. Mentally he collected the\nmaterial as he wended his way to the cafe at which he dined. Then he\nreturned home and seated himself at his table to work. Before his eyes\nwas the sheet of blank paper, but all the material he had amassed had\nescaped him. After trying for an hour, and after filling five pages\nwith sentences which had no connection one with the other, he said: \"I\nam not yet familiar with the work. I must take another lesson.\"\n\nAt ten o'clock the following morning he rang the bell, at his friend's\nhouse. The servant who opened the door, said: \"Monsieur is busy.\"\n\nDuroy had not expected to find Forestier at home. However he said:\n\"Tell him it is M. Duroy on important business.\"\n\nIn the course of five minutes he was ushered into the room in which he\nhad spent so happy a morning. In the place Mme. Forestier had occupied,\nher husband was seated writing, while Mme. Forestier stood by the\nmantelpiece and dictated to him, a cigarette between her lips.\n\nDuroy paused upon the threshold and murmured: \"I beg your pardon, I am\ninterrupting you.\"\n\nHis friend growled angrily: \"What do you want again? Make haste; we are\nbusy.\"\n\nGeorges stammered: \"It is nothing.\"\n\nBut Forestier persisted: \"Come, we are losing time; you did not force\nyour way into the house for the pleasure of bidding us good morning.\"\n\nDuroy, in confusion, replied: \"No, it is this: I cannot complete my\narticle, and you were--so--so kind the last time that I hoped--that I\ndared to come--\"\n\nForestier interrupted with: \"So you think I will do your work and that\nyou have only to take the money. Well, that is fine!\" His wife smoked\non without interfering.\n\nDuroy hesitated: \"Excuse me. I believed--I--thought--\" Then, in a clear\nvoice, he said: \"I beg a thousand pardons, Madame, and thank you very\nmuch for the charming article you wrote for me yesterday.\" Then he\nbowed, and said to Charles: \"I will be at the office at three o'clock.\"\n\nHe returned home saying to himself: \"Very well, I will write it alone\nand they shall see.\" Scarcely had he entered than he began to write,\nanger spurring him on. In an hour he had finished an article, which was\na chaos of absurd matter, and took it boldly to the office. Duroy\nhanded Forestier his manuscript. \"Here is the rest of Algeria.\"\n\n\"Very well, I will hand it to the manager. That will do.\"\n\nWhen Duroy and Saint-Potin, who had some political information to look\nup, were in the hall, the latter asked: \"Have you been to the cashier's\nroom?\"\n\n\"No, why?\"\n\n\"Why? To get your pay? You should always get your salary a month in\nadvance. One cannot tell what might happen. I will introduce you to the\ncashier.\"\n\nDuroy drew his two hundred francs together with twenty-eight francs for\nhis article of the preceding day, which, in addition to what remained\nto him of his salary from the railroad office, left him three hundred\nand forty francs. He had never had so much, and he thought himself rich\nfor an indefinite time. Saint-Potin took him to the offices of four or\nfive rival papers, hoping that the news he had been commissioned to\nobtain had been already received by them and that he could obtain it by\nmeans of his diplomacy.\n\nWhen evening came, Duroy, who had nothing more to do, turned toward the\nFolies-Bergeres, and walking up to the office, he said: \"My name is\nGeorges Duroy. I am on the staff of 'La Vie Francaise.' I was here the\nother night with M. Forestier, who promised to get me a pass. I do not\nknow if he remembered it.\"\n\nThe register was consulted, but his name was not inscribed upon it.\nHowever, the cashier, a very affable man, said to him: \"Come in, M.\nDuroy, and speak to the manager yourself; he will see that everything\nis all right.\"\n\nHe entered and almost at once came upon Rachel, the woman he had seen\nthere before. She approached him: \"Good evening, my dear; are you well?\"\n\n\"Very well; how are you?\"\n\n\"I am not ill. I have dreamed of you twice since the other night.\"\n\nDuroy smiled. \"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"That means that I like you\"; she raised her eyes to the young man's\nface, took his arm and leaning upon it, said: \"Let us drink a glass of\nwine and then take a walk. I should like to go to the opera like this,\nwith you, to show you off.\"\n\n      *       *       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt daybreak he again sallied forth to obtain a \"Vie Francaise.\" He\nopened the paper feverishly; his article was not there. On entering the\noffice several hours later, he said to M. Walter: \"I was very much\nsurprised this morning not to see my second article on Algeria.\"\n\nThe manager raised his head and said sharply: \"I gave it to your\nfriend, Forestier, and asked him to read it; he was dissatisfied with\nit; it will have to be done over.\"\n\nWithout a word, Duroy left the room, and entering his friend's office,\nbrusquely asked: \"Why did not my article appear this morning?\"\n\nThe journalist, who was smoking a cigar, said calmly: \"The manager did\nnot consider it good, and bade me return it to you to be revised. There\nit is.\" Duroy revised it several times, only to have it rejected. He\nsaid nothing more of his \"souvenirs,\" but gave his whole attention to\nreporting. He became acquainted behind the scenes at the theaters, and\nin the halls and corridors of the chamber of deputies; he knew all the\ncabinet ministers, generals, police agents, princes, ambassadors, men\nof the world, Greeks, cabmen, waiters at cafes, and many others. In\nshort he soon became a remarkable reporter, of great value to the\npaper, so M. Walter said. But as he only received ten centimes a line\nin addition to his fixed salary of two hundred francs and as his\nexpenses were large, he never had a sou. When he saw certain of his\nassociates with their pockets full of money, he wondered what secret\nmeans they employed in order to obtain it. He determined to penetrate\nthat mystery, to enter into the association, to obtrude himself upon\nhis comrades, and make them share with him. Often at evening, as he\nwatched the trains pass his window, he dreamed of the conduct he might\npursue.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nTHE FIRST INTRIGUE\n\n\nTwo months elapsed. It was September. The fortune which Duroy had hoped\nto make so rapidly seemed to him slow in coming. Above all he was\ndissatisfied with the mediocrity of his position; he was appreciated,\nbut was treated according to his rank. Forestier himself no longer\ninvited him to dinner, and treated him as an inferior. Often he had\nthought of making Mme. Forestier a visit, but the remembrance of their\nlast meeting restrained him. Mme. de Marelle had invited him to call,\nsaying: \"I am always at home about three o'clock.\" So one afternoon,\nwhen he had nothing to do, he proceeded toward her house. She lived on\nRue Verneuil, on the fourth floor. A maid answered his summons, and\nsaid: \"Yes, Madame is at home, but I do not know whether she has\nrisen.\" She conducted Duroy into the drawing-room, which was large,\npoorly furnished, and somewhat untidy. The shabby, threadbare chairs\nwere ranged along the walls according to the servant's fancy, for there\nwas not a trace visible of the care of a woman who loves her home.\nDuroy took a seat and waited some time. Then a door opened and Mme. de\nMarelle entered hastily, clad in a Japanese dressing-gown. She\nexclaimed:\n\n\"How kind of you to come to see me. I was positive you had forgotten\nme.\" She held out her hand to him with a gesture of delight; and Duroy,\nquite at his ease in that shabby apartment, kissed it as he had seen\nNorbert de Varenne do.\n\nExamining him from head to foot, she cried: \"How you have changed!\nWell; tell me the news.\"\n\nThey began to chat at once as if they were old acquaintances, and in\nfive minutes an intimacy, a mutual understanding, was established\nbetween those two beings alike in character and kind. Suddenly the\nyoung woman said in surprise: \"It is astonishing how I feel with you.\nIt seems to me as if I had known you ten years. We shall undoubtedly\nbecome good friends; would that please you?\"\n\nHe replied: \"Certainly,\" with a smile more expressive than words. He\nthought her very bewitching in her pretty gown. When near Mme.\nForestier, whose impassive, gracious smile attracted yet held at a\ndistance, and seemed to say: \"I like you, yet take care,\" he felt a\ndesire to cast himself at her feet, or to kiss the hem of her garment.\nWhen near Mme. de Marelle, he felt a more passionate desire.\n\nA gentle rap came at the door through which Mme. de Marelle had\nentered, and she cried: \"You may come in, my darling.\"\n\nThe child entered, advanced to Duroy and offered him her hand. The\nastonished mother murmured: \"That is a conquest.\" The young man, having\nkissed the child, seated her by his side, and with a serious air\nquestioned her as to what she had done since they last met. She replied\nin a flute-like voice and with the manner of a woman. The clock struck\nthree; the journalist rose.\n\n\"Come often,\" said Mme. de Marelle; \"it has been a pleasant causerie. I\nshall always be glad to welcome you. Why do I never meet you at the\nForestiers?\"\n\n\"For no particular reason. I am very busy. I hope, however, that we\nshall meet there one of these days.\"\n\nIn the course of a few days he paid another visit to the enchantress.\nThe maid ushered him into the drawing-room and Laurine soon entered;\nshe offered him not her hand but her forehead, and said: \"Mamma wishes\nme to ask you to wait for her about fifteen minutes, for she is not\ndressed. I will keep you company.\"\n\nDuroy, who was amused at the child's ceremonious manner, replied:\n\"Indeed, Mademoiselle, I shall be enchanted to spend a quarter of an\nhour with you.\" When the mother entered they were in the midst of an\nexciting game, and Mme. de Marelle paused in amazement, crying:\n\"Laurine playing? You are a sorcerer, sir!\" He placed the child, whom\nhe had caught in his arms, upon the floor, kissed the lady's hand, and\nthey seated themselves, the child between them. They tried to converse,\nbut Laurine, usually so silent, monopolized the conversation, and her\nmother was compelled to send her to her room.\n\nWhen they were alone, Mme. de Marelle lowered her voice and said: \"I\nhave a great project. It is this: As I dine every week at the\nForesters', I return it from time to time by inviting them to a\nrestaurant. I do not like to have company at home; I am not so situated\nthat I can have any. I know nothing about housekeeping or cooking. I\nprefer a life free from care; therefore I invite them to the cafe\noccasionally; but it is not lively when we are only three. I am telling\nyou this in order to explain such an informal gathering. I should like\nyou to be present at our Saturdays at the Cafe Riche at seven-thirty.\nDo you know the house?\"\n\nDuroy accepted gladly. He left her in a transport of delight and\nimpatiently awaited the day of the dinner. He was the first to arrive\nat the place appointed and was shown into a small private room, in\nwhich the table was laid for four; that table looked very inviting with\nits colored glasses, silver, and candelabra.\n\nDuroy seated himself upon a low bench. Forestier entered and shook\nhands with him with a cordiality he never evinced at the office.\n\n\"The two ladies will come together,\" said he. \"These dinners are truly\ndelightful.\"\n\nVery soon the door opened and Mesdames Forestier and De Marelle\nappeared, heavily veiled, surrounded by the charming mystery necessary\nto a rendezvous in a place so public. As Duroy greeted the former, she\ntook him to task for not having been to see her; then she added with a\nsmile: \"Ah, you prefer Mme. de Marelle; the time passes more pleasantly\nwith her.\"\n\nWhen the waiter handed the wine-list to Forestier, Mme. de Marelle\nexclaimed: \"Bring the gentle-men whatever they want; as for us, we want\nnothing but champagne.\"\n\nForestier, who seemed not to have heard her, asked: \"Do you object to\nmy closing the window? My cough has troubled me for several days.\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\nHis wife did not speak. The various courses were duly served and then\nthe guests began to chat. They discussed a scandal which was being\ncirculated about a society belle. Forestier was very much amused by it.\nDuroy said with a smile: \"How many would abandon themselves to a\ncaprice, a dream of love, if they did not fear that they would pay for\na brief happiness with tears and an irremediable scandal?\"\n\nBoth women glanced at him approvingly. Forestier cried with a sceptical\nlaugh: \"The poor husbands!\" Then they talked of love. Duroy said: \"When\nI love a woman, everything else in the world is forgotten.\"\n\nMme. Forestier murmured: \"There is no happiness comparable to that\nfirst clasp of the hand, when one asks: 'Do you love me?' and the other\nreplies: 'Yes, I love you.'\" Mme. de Marelle cried gaily as she drank a\nglass of champagne: \"I am less Platonic.\"\n\nForestier, lying upon the couch, said in serious tone: \"That frankness\ndoes you honor and proves you to be a practical woman. But might one\nask, what is M. de Marelle's opinion?\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders disdainfully and said: \"M. de Marelle has no\nopinion on that subject.\"\n\nThe conversation grew slow. Mme. de Marelle seemed to offer provocation\nby her remarks, while Mme. Forestier's charming reserve, the modesty in\nher voice, in her smile, all seemed to extenuate the bold sallies which\nissued from her lips. The dessert came and then followed the coffee.\nThe hostess and her guests lighted cigarettes, but Forestier suddenly\nbegan to cough. When the attack was over, he growled angrily: \"These\nparties are not good for me; they are stupid. Let us go home.\"\n\nMme. de Marelle summoned the waiter and asked for her bill. She tried\nto read it, but the figures danced before her eyes; she handed the\npaper to Duroy.\n\n\"Here, pay it for me; I cannot see.\" At the same time, she put her\npurse in his hand.\n\nThe total was one hundred and thirty francs. Duroy glanced at the bill\nand when it was settled, whispered: \"How much shall I give the waiter?\"\n\n\"Whatever you like; I do not know.\"\n\nHe laid five francs upon the plate and handed the purse to its owner,\nsaying: \"Shall I escort you home?\"\n\n\"Certainly; I am unable to find the house.\"\n\nThey shook hands with the Forestiers and were soon rolling along in a\ncab side by side. Duroy could think of nothing to say; he felt impelled\nto clasp her in his arms. \"If I should dare, what would she do?\"\nthought he. The recollection of their conversation at dinner\nemboldened, but the fear of scandal restrained him. Mme. de Marelle\nreclined silently in her corner. He would have thought her asleep, had\nhe not seen her eyes glisten whenever a ray of light penetrated the\ndark recesses of the carriage. Of what was she thinking? Suddenly she\nmoved her foot, nervously, impatiently. That movement caused him to\ntremble, and turning quickly, he cast himself upon her, seeking her\nlips with his. She uttered a cry, attempted to repulse him and then\nyielded to his caresses as if she had not the strength to resist.\n\nThe carriage stopped at her door, but she did not rise; she did not\nmove, stunned by what had just taken place. Fearing that the cabman\nwould mistrust something, Duroy alighted from the cab first and offered\nhis hand to the young woman. Finally she got out, but in silence.\nGeorges rang the bell, and when the door was opened, he asked timidly:\n\"When shall I see you again?\"\n\nShe whispered so low that he could barely hear her: \"Come and lunch\nwith me to-morrow.\" With those words she disappeared.\n\nDuroy gave the cabman a five-franc piece, and turned away with a\ntriumphant, joyful air. He had at last conquered a married woman! A\nwoman of the world! A Parisian! How easy it had been!\n\nHe was somewhat nervous the following day as he ascended Mme. de\nMarelle's staircase. How would she receive him? Suppose she forbade him\nto enter her house? If she had told--but no, she could not tell\nanything without telling the whole truth! He was master of the\nsituation!\n\nThe little maid-servant opened the door. She was as pleasant as usual.\nDuroy felt reassured and asked: \"Is Madame well?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; as well as she always is,\" was the reply, and he was ushered\ninto the salon. He walked to the mantelpiece to see what kind of an\nappearance he presented: he was readjusting his cravat when he saw in\nthe mirror the young woman standing on the threshold looking at him. He\npretended not to have seen her, and for several moments they gazed at\none another in the mirror. Then he turned. She had not moved; she\nseemed to be waiting. He rushed toward her crying: \"How I love you!\" He\nclasped her to his breast. He thought: \"It is easier than I thought it\nwould be. All is well.\" He looked at her with a smile, without uttering\na word, trying to put into his glance a wealth of love. She too smiled\nand murmured: \"We are alone. I sent Laurine to lunch with a friend.\"\n\nHe sighed, and kissing her wrists said: \"Thanks; I adore you.\" She took\nhis arm as if he had been her husband, and led him to a couch, upon\nwhich they seated themselves side by side. Duroy stammered,\nincoherently: \"You do not care for me.\"\n\nShe laid her hand upon his lips. \"Be silent!\"\n\n\"How I love you!\" said he.\n\nShe repeated: \"Be silent!\"\n\nThey could hear the servant laying the table in the dining-room. He\nrose: \"I cannot sit so near you. I shall lose my head.\"\n\nThe door opened: \"Madame is served!\"\n\nHe offered her his arm gravely. They lunched without knowing what they\nwere eating. The servant came and went without seeming to notice\nanything. When the meal was finished, they returned to the drawing-room\nand resumed their seats on the couch side by side. Gradually he drew\nnearer her and tried to embrace her.\n\n\"Be careful, some one might come in.\"\n\nHe whispered: \"When can I see you alone to tell you how I love you?\"\n\nShe leaned toward him and said softly: \"I will pay you a visit one of\nthese days.\"\n\nHe colored. \"My rooms--are--are--very modest.\"\n\nShe smiled: \"That makes no difference. I shall come to see you and not\nyour rooms.\"\n\nHe urged her to tell him when she would come. She fixed a day in the\nfollowing week, while he besought her with glowing eyes to hasten the\nday. She was amused to see him implore so ardently and yielded a day at\na time. He repeated: \"To-morrow, say--to-morrow.\" Finally she\nconsented. \"Yes, to-morrow at five o'clock.\"\n\nHe drew a deep breath; then they chatted together as calmly as if they\nhad known one another for twenty years. A ring caused them to start;\nthey separated. She murmured: \"It is Laurine.\"\n\nThe child entered, paused in surprise, then ran toward Duroy clapping\nher hands, delighted to see him, and crying: \"Ah, 'Bel-Ami!'\"\n\nMme. de Marelle laughed. \"Bel-Ami! Laurine has christened you. It is a\npretty name. I shall call you Bel-Ami, too!\"\n\nHe took the child upon his knee. At twenty minutes of three he rose to\ngo to the office; at the half-open door he whispered: \"To-morrow, five\no'clock.\" The young woman replied: \"Yes,\" with a smile and disappeared.\n\nAfter he had finished his journalistic work, he tried to render his\napartments more fit to receive his expected visitor. He was well\nsatisfied with the results of his efforts and retired, lulled to rest\nby the whistling of the trains. Early the next morning he bought a cake\nand a bottle of Madeira. He spread the collation on his dressing-table\nwhich was covered with a napkin. Then he waited. She came at a quarter\npast five and exclaimed as she entered: \"Why, it is nice here. But\nthere were a great many people on the stairs.\"\n\nHe took her in his arms and kissed her hair. An hour and a half later\nhe escorted her to a cab-stand on the Rue de Rome. When she was seated\nin the cab, he whispered: \"Tuesday, at the same hour.\"\n\nShe repeated his words, and as it was night, she kissed him. Then as\nthe cabman started up his horse, she cried: \"Adieu, Bel-Ami!\" and the\nold coupe rumbled off.\n\nFor three weeks Duroy received Mme. de Marelle every two or three days,\nsometimes in the morning, sometimes in the evening.\n\nAs he was awaiting her one afternoon, a noise on the staircase drew him\nto his door. A child screamed. A man's angry voice cried: \"What is the\nbrat howling about?\"\n\nA woman's voice replied: \"Nicolas has been tripped up on the\nlanding-place by the journalist's sweetheart.\"\n\nDuroy retreated, for he heard the rustling of skirts. Soon there was a\nknock at his door, which he opened, and Mme. de Marelle rushed in,\ncrying: \"Did you hear?\" Georges feigned ignorance of the matter.\n\n\"No; what?\"\n\n\"How they insulted me?\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Those miserable people below.\"\n\n\"Why, no; what is it? Tell me.\"\n\nShe sobbed and could not speak. He was forced to place her upon his bed\nand to lay a damp cloth upon her temples. When she grew calmer, anger\nsucceeded her agitation. She wanted Duroy to go downstairs at once, to\nfight them, to kill them.\n\nHe replied: \"They are working-people. Just think, it would be necessary\nto go to court where you would be recognized; one must not compromise\noneself with such people.\"\n\nShe said: \"What shall we do? I cannot come here again.\"\n\nHe replied: \"That is very simple. I will move.\"\n\nShe murmured: \"Yes, but that will take some time.\"\n\nSuddenly she said: \"Listen to me, I have found a means; do not worry\nabout it. I will send you a 'little blue' to-morrow morning.\" She\ncalled a telegram a \"little blue.\"\n\nShe smiled with delight at her plans, which she would not reveal. She\nwas, however, very much affected as she descended the staircase and\nleaned with all her strength upon her lover's arm. They met no one.\n\nHe was still in bed the following morning when the promised telegram\nwas handed him. Duroy opened it and read:\n\n    \"Come at five o'clock to Rue de Constantinople, No. 127. Ask\n     for the room rented by Mme. Duroy. CLO.\"\n\nAt five o'clock precisely he entered a large furnished house and asked\nthe janitor: \"Has Mme. Duroy hired a room here?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Will you show me to it, if you please?\"\n\nThe man, accustomed no doubt to situations in which it was necessary to\nbe prudent, looked him straight in the eyes; then selecting a key, he\nasked: \"Are you M. Duroy?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nHe opened a small suite, comprising two rooms on the ground floor.\n\nDuroy thought uneasily: \"This will cost a fortune. I shall have to run\ninto debt. She has done a very foolish thing.\"\n\nThe door opened and Clotilde rushed in. She was enchanted. \"Is it not\nfine? There are no stairs to climb; it is on the ground floor! One\ncould come and go through the window without the porter seeing one.\"\n\nHe embraced her nervously, not daring to ask the question that hovered\nupon his lips. She had placed a large package on the stand in the\ncenter of the room. Opening it she took out a tablet of soap, a bottle\nof Lubin's extract, a sponge, a box of hairpins, a button-hook, and\ncurling-tongs. Then she amused herself by finding places in which to\nput them.\n\nShe talked incessantly as she opened the drawers: \"I must bring some\nlinen in order to have a change. We shall each have a key, besides the\none at the lodge, in case we should forget ours. I rented the\napartments for three months--in your name, of course, for I could not\ngive mine.\"\n\nThen he asked: \"Will you tell me when to pay?\"\n\nShe replied simply: \"It is paid, my dear.\"\n\nHe made a pretense of being angry: \"I cannot permit that.\"\n\nShe laid her hand upon his shoulder and said in a supplicatory tone:\n\"Georges, it will give me pleasure to have the nest mine. Say that you\ndo not care, dear Georges,\" and he yielded. When she had left him, he\nmurmured: \"She is kind-hearted, anyway.\"\n\nSeveral days later he received a telegram which read:\n\n    \"My husband is coming home this evening. We shall therefore not\n     meet for a week. What a bore, my dearest!\"\n\n    \"YOUR CLO.\"\n\nDuroy was startled; he had not realized the fact that Mme. de Marelle\nwas married. He impatiently awaited her husband's departure. One\nmorning he received the following telegram:\n\n     \"Five o'clock.--CLO.\"\n\nWhen they met, she rushed into his arms, kissed him passionately, and\nasked: \"After a while will you take me to dine?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my darling, wherever you wish to go.\"\n\n\"I should like to go to some restaurant frequented by the\nworking-classes.\"\n\nThey repaired to a wine merchant's where meals were also served.\nClotilde's entrance caused a sensation on account of the elegance of\nher dress. They partook of a ragout of mutton and left that place to\nenter a ball-room in which she pressed more closely to his side. In\nfifteen minutes her curiosity was satisfied and he conducted her home.\nThen followed a series of visits to all sorts of places of amusement.\nDuroy soon began to tire of those expeditions, for he had exhausted all\nhis resources and all means of obtaining money. In addition to that he\nowed Forestier a hundred francs, Jacques Rival three hundred, and he\nwas hampered with innumerable petty debts ranging from twenty francs to\none hundred sous.\n\nOn the fourteenth of December, he was left without a sou in his pocket.\nAs he had often done before, he did not lunch, and spent the afternoon\nworking at the office. At four o'clock he received a telegram from Mme.\nde Marelle, saying: \"Shall we dine together and afterward have a\nfrolic?\"\n\nHe replied at once: \"Impossible to dine,\" then he added: \"But I will\nexpect you at our apartments at nine o'clock.\" Having sent a boy with\nthe note in order to save the money for a telegram, he tried to think\nof some way by which he could obtain his evening meal. He waited until\nall of his associates had gone and when he was alone, he rang for the\nporter, put his hand in his pocket and said: \"Foucart, I have left my\npurse at home and I have to dine at the Luxembourg. Lend me fifty sous\nto pay for my cab.\"\n\nThe man handed him three francs and asked:\n\n\"Is that enough?\"\n\n\"Yes, thank you.\" Taking the coins, Duroy rushed down the staircase and\ndined at a cookshop.\n\nAt nine o'clock, Mme. de Marelle, whom he awaited in the tiny salon,\narrived. She wished to take a walk and he objected. His opposition\nirritated her.\n\n\"I shall go alone, then. Adieu!\"\n\nSeeing that the situation was becoming grave, he seized her hands and\nkissed them, saying:\n\n\"Pardon me, darling; I am nervous and out of sorts this evening. I have\nbeen annoyed by business matters.\"\n\nSomewhat appeased but still, vexed, she replied:\n\n\"That does not concern me; I will not be the butt for your ill humor.\"\n\nHe clasped her in his arms and murmured his apologies. Still she\npersisted in her desire to go out.\n\n\"I beseech you, remain here by the fire with me. Say yes.\"\n\n\"No,\" she replied, \"I will not yield to your caprices.\"\n\nHe insisted: \"I have a reason, a serious reason--\"\n\n\"If you will not go with me, I shall go alone. Adieu!\"\n\nShe disengaged herself from his embrace and fled to the door. He\nfollowed her:\n\n\"Listen Clo, my little Clo, listen to me--\"\n\nShe shook her head, evaded his caresses and tried to escape from his\nencircling arms.\n\n\"I have a reason--\"\n\nLooking him in the face, she said: \"You lie! What is it?\"\n\nHe colored, and in order to avoid a rupture, confessed in accents of\ndespair: \"I have no money!\"\n\nShe would not believe him until he had turned all his pockets inside\nout, to prove his words. Then she fell upon his breast: \"Oh, my poor\ndarling! Had I known! How did it happen?\"\n\nHe invented a touching story to this effect: That his father was in\nstraitened circumstances, that he had given him not only his savings,\nbut had run himself into debt.\n\n\"I shall have to starve for the next six months.\"\n\n\"Shall I lend you some?\" she whispered.\n\nHe replied with dignity: \"You are very kind, dearest; but do not\nmention that again; it wounds me.\"\n\nShe murmured: \"You will never know how much I love you.\" On taking\nleave of him, she asked: \"Shall we meet again the day after to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"At the same time?\"\n\n\"Yes, my darling.\"\n\nThey parted.\n\nWhen Duroy opened his bedroom door and fumbled in his vest pocket for a\nmatch, he was amazed to find in it a piece of money--a twenty-franc\npiece! At first he wondered by what miracle it had got there; suddenly\nit occurred to him that Mme. de Marelle had given him alms! Angry and\nhumiliated, he determined to return it when next they met. The next\nmorning it was late when he awoke; he tried to overcome his hunger. He\nwent out and as he passed the restaurants he could scarcely resist\ntheir temptations. At noon he said: \"Bah, I shall lunch upon Clotilde's\ntwenty francs; that will not hinder me from returning the money\nto-morrow.\"\n\nHe ate his lunch, for which he paid two francs fifty, and on entering\nthe office of \"La Vie Francaise\" he repaid the porter the three francs\nhe had borrowed from him. He worked until seven o'clock, then he dined,\nand he continued to draw upon the twenty francs until only four francs\ntwenty remained. He decided to say to Mme. de Marelle upon her arrival:\n\n\"I found the twenty-franc piece you slipped into my pocket. I will not\nreturn the money to-day, but I will repay you when we next meet.\"\n\nWhen Madame came, he dared not broach the delicate subject. They spent\nthe evening together and appointed their next meeting for Wednesday of\nthe following week, for Mme. de Marelle had a number of engagements.\nDuroy continued to accept money from Clotilde and quieted his\nconscience by assuring himself: \"I will give it back in a lump. It is\nnothing but borrowed money anyway.\" So he kept account of all that he\nreceived in order to pay it back some day.\n\nOne evening, Mme. de Marelle said to him: \"Would you believe that I\nhave never been to the Folies-Bergeres; will you take me there?\"\n\nHe hesitated, fearing a meeting with Rachel. Then he thought: \"Bah, I\nam not married after all. If she should see me, she would take in the\nsituation and not accost me. Moreover, we would have a box.\"\n\nWhen they entered the hall, it was crowded; with difficulty they made\ntheir way to their seats. Mme. de Marelle did not look at the stage;\nshe was interested in watching the women who were promenading, and she\nfelt an irresistible desire to touch them, to see of what those beings\nwere made. Suddenly she said:\n\n\"There is a large brunette who stares at us all the time. I think every\nminute she will speak to us. Have you seen her?\"\n\nHe replied: \"No, you are mistaken.\"\n\nHe told an untruth, for he had noticed the woman, who was no other than\nRachel, with anger in her eyes and violent words upon her lips.\n\nDuroy had passed her when he and Mme. de Marelle entered and she had\nsaid to him: \"Good evening,\" in a low voice and with a wink which said\n\"I understand.\" But he had not replied; for fear of being seen by his\nsweetheart he passed her coldly, disdainfully. The woman, her jealousy\naroused, followed the couple and said in a louder key: \"Good evening,\nGeorges.\" He paid no heed to her. Then she was determined to be\nrecognized and she remained near their box, awaiting a favorable\nmoment. When she saw that she was observed by Mme. de Marelle, she\ntouched Duroy's shoulder with the tip of her finger, and said:\n\n\"Good evening. How are you?\"\n\nBut Georges did not turn his head.\n\nShe continued: \"Have you grown deaf since Thursday?\"\n\nStill he did not reply. She laughed angrily and cried:\n\n\"Are you dumb, too? Perhaps Madame has your tongue?\"\n\nWith a furious glance, Duroy then exclaimed:\n\n\"How dare you accost me? Go along or I will have you arrested.\"\n\nWith flaming eyes, she cried: \"Ah, is that so! Because you are with\nanother is no reason that you cannot recognize me. If you had made the\nleast sign of recognition when you passed me, I would not have molested\nyou. You did not even say good evening to me when you met me.\"\n\nDuring that tirade Mme. de Marelle in affright opened the door of the\nbox and fled through the crowd seeking an exit. Duroy rushed after her.\nRachel, seeing him disappear, cried: \"Stop her! she has stolen my\nlover!\"\n\nTwo men seized the fugitive by the shoulder, but Duroy, who had caught\nup with her, bade them desist, and together he and Clotilde reached the\nstreet.\n\nThey entered a cab. The cabman asked: \"Where shall I drive to?\" Duroy\nreplied: \"Where you will!\"\n\nClotilde sobbed hysterically. Duroy did not know what to say or do. At\nlength he stammered:\n\n\"Listen Clo--my dearest Clo, let me explain. It is not my fault. I knew\nthat woman--long ago--\"\n\nShe raised her head and with the fury of a betrayed woman, she cried\ndisconnectedly: \"Ah, you miserable fellow--what a rascal you are! Is it\npossible? What disgrace, oh, my God! You gave her my money--did you\nnot? I gave him the money--for that woman--oh, the wretch!\"\n\nFor several moments she seemed to be vainly seeking an epithet more\nforcible. Suddenly leaning forward she grasped the cabman's sleeve.\n\"Stop!\" she cried, and opening the door, she alighted. Georges was\nabout to follow her but she commanded: \"I forbid you to follow me,\" in\na voice so loud that the passers-by crowded around her, and Duroy dared\nnot stir for fear of a scandal.\n\nShe drew out her purse, and taking two francs fifty from it, she handed\nit to the cabman, saying aloud: \"Here is the money for your hour. Take\nthat rascal to Rue Boursault at Batignolles!\"\n\nThe crowd applauded; one man said: \"Bravo, little one!\" and the cab\nmoved on, followed by the jeers of the bystanders.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nA STEP UPWARD\n\n\nThe next morning Georges Duroy arose, dressed himself, and determined\nto have money; he sought Forestier. His friend received him in his\nstudy.\n\n\"What made you rise so early?\" he asked.\n\n\"A very serious matter. I have a debt of honor.\"\n\n\"A gaming debt?\"\n\nHe hesitated, then repeated: \"A gaming debt.\"\n\n\"Is it large?\"\n\n\"Five hundred francs.\" He only needed two hundred and eighty.\n\nForestier asked sceptically: \"To whom do you owe that amount?\"\n\nDuroy did not reply at once. \"To--to--a--M. de Carleville.\"\n\n\"Ah, where does he live?\"\n\n\"Rue--Rue--\"\n\nForestier laughed. \"I know the gentleman! If you want twenty francs you\ncan have them, but no more.\"\n\nDuroy took the gold-piece, called upon more friends, and by five\no'clock had collected eighty francs. As he required two hundred more,\nhe kept what he had begged and muttered: \"I shall not worry about it. I\nwill pay it when I can.\"\n\nFor two weeks he lived economically, but at the end of that time, the\ngood resolutions he had formed vanished, and one evening he returned to\nthe Folies Bergeres in search of Rachel; but the woman was implacable\nand heaped coarse insults upon him, until he felt his cheeks tingle and\nhe left the hall.\n\nForestier, out of health and feeble, made Duroy's existence at the\noffice insupportable. The latter did not reply to his rude remarks, but\ndetermined to be avenged. He called upon Mme. Forestier. He found her\nreclining upon a couch, reading. She held out her hand without rising\nand said: \"Good morning, Bel-Ami!\"\n\n\"Why do you call me by that name?\"\n\nShe replied with a smile: \"I saw Mme. de Marelle last week and I know\nwhat they have christened you at her house.\"\n\nHe took a seat near his hostess and glanced at her curiously; she was a\ncharming blonde, fair and plump, made for caresses, and he thought:\n\"She is certainly nicer than the other one.\" He did not doubt that he\nwould only have to extend his hand in order to gather the fruit. As he\ngazed upon her she chided him for his neglect of her.\n\nHe replied: \"I did not come because it was for the best--\"\n\n\"How? Why?\"\n\n\"Why? Can you not guess?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Because I loved you; a little, only a little, and I did not wish to\nlove you any more.\"\n\nShe did not seem surprised, nor flattered; she smiled indifferently and\nreplied calmly: \"Oh, you can come just the same; no one loves me long.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because it is useless, and I tell them so at once. If you had\nconfessed your fears to me sooner, I would have reassured you. My dear\nfriend, a man in love is not only foolish but dangerous. I cease all\nintercourse with people who love me or pretend to; firstly, because\nthey bore me, and secondly, because I look upon them with dread, as I\nwould upon a mad dog. I know that your love is only a kind of appetite;\nwhile with me it would be a communion of souls. Now, look me in the\nface--\" she no longer smiled. \"I will never be your sweetheart; it is\ntherefore useless for you to persist in your efforts. And now that I\nhave explained, shall we be friends?\"\n\nHe knew that that sentence was irrevocable, and delighted to be able to\nform such an alliance as she proposed, he extended both hands, saying:\n\n\"I am yours, Madame, to do with as you will\"\n\nHe kissed her hands and raising his head said: \"If I had found a woman\nlike you, how gladly would I have married her.\"\n\nShe was touched by those words, and in a soft voice, placing her hand\nupon his arm, she said: \"I am going to begin my offices at once. You\nare not diplomatic--\" she hesitated. \"May I speak freely?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Call upon Mme. Walter who has taken a fancy to you. But be guarded as\nto your compliments, for she is virtuous. You will make a better\nimpression there by being careful in your remarks. I know that your\nposition at the office is unsatisfactory, but do not worry; all their\nemployees are treated alike.\"\n\nHe said: \"Thanks; you are an angel--a guardian angel.\"\n\nAs he took his leave, he asked again: \"Are we friends--is it settled?\"\n\n\"It is.\"\n\nHaving observed the effect of his last compliment, he said: \"If you\never become a widow, I have put in my application!\" Then he left the\nroom hastily in order not to allow her time to be angry.\n\nDuroy did not like to call on Mme. Walter, for he had never been\ninvited, and he did not wish to commit a breach of etiquette. The\nmanager had been kind to him, appreciated his services, employed him to\ndo difficult work, why should he not profit by that show of favor to\ncall at his house? One day, therefore, he repaired to the market and\nbought twenty-five pears. Having carefully arranged them in a basket to\nmake them appear as if they came from a distance he took them to Mme.\nWalter's door with his card on which was inscribed:\n\n    \"Georges Duroy begs Mme. Walter to accept the fruit which he\n     received this morning from Normandy.\"\n\nThe following day he found in his letter-box at the office an envelope\ncontaining Mme, Walter's card on which was written:\n\n    \"Mme. Walter thanks M. Georges Duroy very much, and is at home\n     on Saturdays.\"\n\nThe next Saturday he called. M. Walter lived on Boulevard Malesherbes\nin a double house which he owned. The reception-rooms were on the first\nfloor. In the antechamber were two footmen; one took Duroy's overcoat,\nthe other his cane, put it aside, opened a door and announced the\nvisitor's name. In the large mirror in the apartment Duroy could see\nthe reflection of people seated in another room. He passed through two\ndrawing-rooms and entered a small boudoir in which four ladies were\ngathered around a tea-table. Notwithstanding the assurance he had\ngained during his life in Paris, and especially since he had been\nthrown in contact with so many noted personages, Duroy felt abashed. He\nstammered:\n\n\"Madame, I took the liberty.\"\n\nThe mistress of the house extended her hand and said to him: \"You are\nvery kind, M. Duroy, to come to see me.\" She pointed to a chair. The\nladies chatted on. Visitors came and went. Mme. Walter noticed that\nDuroy said nothing, that no one addressed him, that he seemed\ndisconcerted, and she drew him into the conversation which dealt with\nthe admission of a certain M. Linet to the Academy. When Duroy had\ntaken his leave, one of the ladies said: \"How odd he is! Who is he?\"\n\nMme. Walter replied: \"One of our reporters; he only occupies a minor\nposition, but I think he will advance rapidly.\"\n\nIn the meantime, while he was being discussed, Duroy walked gaily down\nBoulevard Malesherbes.\n\nThe following week he was appointed editor of the \"Echoes,\" and invited\nto dine at Mme. Walter's. The \"Echoes\" were, M. Walter said, the very\npith of the paper. Everything and everybody should be remembered, all\ncountries, all professions, Paris and the provinces, the army, the\narts, the clergy, the schools, the rulers, and the courtiers. The man\nat the head of that department should be wide awake, always on his\nguard, quick to judge of what was best to be said and best to be\nomitted, to divine what would please the public and to present it well.\nDuroy was just the man for the place.\n\nHe was enjoying the fact of his promotion, when he received an engraved\ncard which read:\n\n    \"M. and Mme. Walter request the pleasure of M. Georges Duroy's\n     company at dinner on Thursday, January 20.\"\n\nHe was so delighted that he kissed the invitation as if it had been a\nlove-letter.\n\nThen he sought the cashier to settle the important question of his\nsalary. At first twelve hundred francs were allowed Duroy, who intended\nto save a large share of the money. He was busy two days getting\nsettled in his new position, in a large room, one end of which he\noccupied, and the other end of which was allotted to Boisrenard, who\nworked with him.\n\nThe day of the dinner-party he left the office in good season, in order\nto have time to dress, and was walking along Rue de Londres when he saw\nbefore him a form which resembled Mme. de Marelle's. He felt his cheeks\nglow and his heart throb. He crossed the street in order to see the\nlady's face; he was mistaken, and breathed more freely. He had often\nwondered what he should do if he met Clotilde face to face. Should he\nbow to her or pretend not to see her? \"I should not see her,\" thought\nhe.\n\nWhen Duroy entered his rooms he thought: \"I must change my apartments;\nthese will not do any longer.\" He felt both nervous and gay, and said\naloud to himself: \"I must write to my father.\" Occasionally he wrote\nhome, and his letters always delighted his old parents. As he tied his\ncravat at the mirror he repeated: \"I must write home to-morrow. If my\nfather could see me this evening in the house to which I am going, he\nwould be surprised. Sacristi, I shall soon give a dinner which has\nnever been equaled!\"\n\nThen he recalled his old home, the faces of his father and mother. He\nsaw them seated at their homely board, eating their soup. He remembered\nevery wrinkle on their old faces, every movement of their hands and\nheads; he even knew what they said to each other every evening as they\nsupped. He thought: \"I will go to see them some day.\" His toilette\ncompleted, he extinguished his light and descended the stairs.\n\nOn reaching his destination, he boldly entered the antechamber, lighted\nby bronze lamps, and gave his cane and his overcoat to the two lackeys\nwho approached him. All the salons were lighted. Mme. Walter received\nin the second, the largest. She greeted Duroy with a charming smile,\nand he shook hands with two men who arrived after him, M. Firmin and M.\nLaroche-Mathieu; the latter had especial authority at the office on\naccount of his influence in the chamber of deputies.\n\nThen the Forestiers arrived, Madeleine looking charming in pink.\nCharles had become very much emaciated and coughed incessantly.\n\nNorbert de Varenne and Jacques Rival came together. A door opened at\nthe end of the room, and M. Walter entered with two tall young girls of\nsixteen and seventeen; one plain, the other pretty. Duroy knew that the\nmanager was a paterfamilias, but he was astonished. He had thought of\nthe manager's daughters as one thinks of a distant country one will\nnever see. Then, too, he had fancied them children, and he saw women.\nThey shook hands upon being introduced and seated themselves at a table\nset apart for them. One of the guests had not arrived, and that\nembarrassing silence which precedes dinners in general reigned supreme.\n\nDuroy happening to glance at the walls, M. Walter said: \"You are\nlooking at my pictures? I will show them all to you.\" And he took a\nlamp that they might distinguish all the details. There were landscapes\nby Guillemet; \"A Visit to the Hospital,\" by Gervex; \"A Widow,\" by\nBouguereau; \"An Execution,\" by Jean Paul Laurens, and many others.\n\nDuroy exclaimed: \"Charming, charming, char--\" but stopped short on\nhearing behind him the voice of Mme. de Marelle who had just entered.\nM. Walter continued to exhibit and explain his pictures; but Duroy saw\nnothing--heard without comprehending. Mme. de Marelle was there, behind\nhim. What should he do? If he greeted her, might she not turn her back\nupon him or utter some insulting remark? If he did not approach her,\nwhat would people think? He was so ill at ease that at one time he\nthought he should feign indisposition and return home.\n\nThe pictures had all been exhibited. M. Walter placed the lamp on the\ntable and greeted the last arrival, while Duroy recommenced alone an\nexamination of the canvas, as if he could not tear himself away. What\nshould he do? He heard their voices and their conversation. Mme.\nForestier called him; he hastened toward her. It was to introduce him\nto a friend who was on the point of giving a fete, and who wanted a\ndescription of it in \"La Vie Francaise.\"\n\nHe stammered: \"Certainly, Madame, certainly.\"\n\nMadame de Marelle was very near him; he dared not turn to go away.\nSuddenly to his amazement, she exclaimed: \"Good evening, Bel-Ami; do\nyou not remember me?\"\n\nHe turned upon his heel hastily; she stood before him smiling, her eyes\noverflowing with roguishness and affection. She offered him her hand;\nhe took it doubtfully, fearing some perfidy. She continued calmly:\n\"What has become of you? One never sees you!\"\n\nNot having regained his self-possession, he murmured: \"I have had a\ngreat deal to do, Madame, a great deal to do. M. Walter has given me\nanother position and the duties are very arduous.\"\n\n\"I know, but that is no excuse for forgetting your friends.\"\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the entrance of a large woman,\ndecollette, with red arms, red cheeks, and attired in gay colors. As\nshe was received with effusion, Duroy asked Mme. Forestier: \"Who is\nthat person?\"\n\n\"Viscountess de Percemur, whose nom de plume is 'Patte Blanche.'\"\n\nHe was surprised and with difficulty restrained a burst of laughter.\n\n\"Patte Blanche? I fancied her a young woman like you. Is that Patte\nBlanche? Ah, she is handsome, very handsome!\"\n\nA servant appeared at the door and announced: \"Madame is served.\"\n\nDuroy was placed between the manager's plain daughter, Mlle. Rose, and\nMme. de Marelle. The proximity of the latter embarrassed him somewhat,\nalthough she appeared at ease and conversed with her usual spirit.\nGradually, however, his assurance returned, and before the meal was\nover, he knew that their relations would be renewed. Wishing, too, to\nbe polite to his employer's daughter, he addressed her from time to\ntime. She responded as her mother would have done, without any\nhesitation as to what she should say. At M. Walter's right sat\nViscountess de Percemur, and Duroy, looking at her with a smile, asked\nMme. de Marelle in a low voice: \"Do you know the one who signs herself\n'Domino Rose'?\"\n\n\"Yes, perfectly; Baroness de Livar.\"\n\n\"Is she like the Countess?\"\n\n\"No. But she is just as comical. She is sixty years old, has false\ncurls and teeth, wit of the time of the Restoration, and toilettes of\nthe same period.\"\n\nWhen the guests returned to the drawing-room, Duroy asked Mme. de\nMarelle: \"May I escort you home?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because M. Laroche-Mathieu, who is my neighbor, leaves me at my door\nevery time that I dine here.\"\n\n\"When shall I see you again?\"\n\n\"Lunch with me to-morrow.\"\n\nThey parted without another word. Duroy did not remain late; as he\ndescended the staircase, he met Norbert de Varenne, who was likewise\ngoing away. The old poet took his arm; fearing no rivalry on the\nnewspaper, their work being essentially different, he was very friendly\nto the young man.\n\n\"Shall we walk along together?\"\n\n\"I shall be pleased to,\" replied Duroy.\n\nThe streets were almost deserted that night. At first the two men did\nnot speak. Then Duroy, in order to make some remark, said: \"That M.\nLaroche-Mathieu looks very intelligent.\"\n\nThe old poet murmured: \"Do you think so?\"\n\nThe younger man hesitated in surprise: \"Why, yes! Is he not considered\none of the most capable men in the Chamber?\"\n\n\"That may be. In a kingdom of blind men the blind are kings. All those\npeople are divided between money and politics; they are pedants to whom\nit is impossible to speak of anything that is familiar to us. Ah, it is\ndifficult to find a man who is liberal in his ideas! I have known\nseveral, they are dead. Still, what difference does a little more or a\nlittle less genius make, since all must come to an end?\" He paused, and\nDuroy said with a smile:\n\n\"You are gloomy to-night, sir!\"\n\nThe poet replied: \"I always am, my child; you will be too in a few\nyears. While one is climbing the ladder, one sees the top and feels\nhopeful; but when one has reached that summit, one sees the descent and\nthe end which is death. It is slow work ascending, but one descends\nrapidly. At your age one is joyous; one hopes for many things which\nnever come to pass. At mine, one expects nothing but death.\"\n\nDuroy laughed: \"Egad, you make me shudder.\"\n\nNorbert de Varenne continued: \"You do not understand me now, but later\non you will remember what I have told you. We breathe, sleep, drink,\neat, work, and then die! The end of life is death. What do you long\nfor? Love? A few kisses and you will be powerless. Money? What for? To\ngratify your desires. Glory? What comes after it all? Death! Death\nalone is certain.\"\n\nHe stopped, took Duroy by his coat collar and said slowly: \"Ponder upon\nall that, young man; think it over for days, months, and years, and you\nwill see life from a different standpoint. I am a lonely, old man. I\nhave neither father, mother, brother, sister, wife, children, nor God.\nI have only poetry. Marry, my friend; you do not know what it is to\nlive alone at my age. It is so lonesome. I seem to have no one upon\nearth. When one is old it is a comfort to have children.\"\n\nWhen they reached Rue de Bourgogne, the poet halted before a high\nhouse, rang the bell, pressed Duroy's hand and said: \"Forget what I\nhave said to you, young man, and live according to your age. Adieu!\"\nWith those words he disappeared in the dark corridor.\n\nDuroy felt somewhat depressed on leaving Varenne, but on his way a\nperfumed damsel passed by him and recalled to his mind his\nreconciliation with Mme. de Marelle. How delightful was the realization\nof one's hopes!\n\nThe next morning he arrived at his lady-love's door somewhat early; she\nwelcomed him as if there had been no rupture, and said as she kissed\nhim:\n\n\"You do not know how annoyed I am, my beloved; I anticipated a\ndelightful honeymoon and now my husband has come home for six weeks.\nBut I could not let so long a time go by without seeing you, especially\nafter our little disagreement, and this is how I have arranged matters:\nCome to dinner Monday. I will introduce you to M. de Marelle, I have\nalready spoken of you to him.\"\n\nDuroy hesitated in perplexity; he feared he might betray something by a\nword, a glance. He stammered:\n\n\"No, I would rather not meet your husband.\"\n\n\"Why not? How absurd! Such things happen every day. I did not think you\nso foolish.\"\n\n\"Very well, I will come to dinner Monday.\"\n\n\"To make it more pleasant, I will have the Forestiers, though I do not\nlike to receive company at home.\"\n\nOn Monday as he ascended Mme. de Marelle's staircase, he felt strangely\ntroubled; not that he disliked to take her husband's hand, drink his\nwine, and eat his bread, but he dreaded something, he knew not what. He\nwas ushered into the salon and he waited as usual. Then the door\nopened, and a tall man with a white beard, grave and precise, advanced\ntoward him and said courteously:\n\n\"My wife has often spoken of you, sir; I am charmed to make your\nacquaintance.\"\n\nDuroy tried to appear cordial and shook his host's proffered hand with\nexaggerated energy. M. de Marelle put a log upon the fire and asked:\n\n\"Have you been engaged in journalism a long time?\"\n\nDuroy replied: \"Only a few months.\" His embarrassment wearing off, he\nbegan to consider the situation very amusing. He gazed at M. de\nMarelle, serious and dignified, and felt a desire to laugh aloud. At\nthat moment Mme. de Marelle entered and approached Duroy, who in the\npresence of her husband dared not kiss her hand. Laurine entered next,\nand offered her brow to Georges. Her mother said to her:\n\n\"You do not call M. Duroy Bel-Ami to-day.\"\n\nThe child blushed as if it were a gross indiscretion to reveal her\nsecret.\n\nWhen the Forestiers arrived, Duroy was startled at Charles's\nappearance. He had grown thinner and paler in a week and coughed\nincessantly; he said they would leave for Cannes on the following\nThursday at the doctor's orders. They did not stay late; after they had\nleft, Duroy said, with a shake of his head:\n\n\"He will not live long.\"\n\nMme. de Marelle replied calmly: \"No, he is doomed! He was a lucky man\nto obtain such a wife.\"\n\nDuroy asked: \"Does she help him very much?\"\n\n\"She does all the work; she is well posted on every subject, and she\nalways gains her point, as she wants it, and when she wants it! Oh, she\nis as maneuvering as anyone! She is a treasure to a man who wishes to\nsucceed.\"\n\nGeorges replied: \"She will marry very soon again, I have no doubt.\"\n\n\"Yes! I should not even be surprised if she had some one in view--a\ndeputy! but I do not know anything about it.\"\n\nM. de Marelle said impatiently: \"You infer so many things that I do not\nlike! We should never interfere in the affairs of others. Everyone\nshould make that a rule.\"\n\nDuroy took his leave with a heavy heart. The next day he called on the\nForestiers, and found them in the midst of packing. Charles lay upon a\nsofa and repeated: \"I should have gone a month ago.\" Then he proceeded\nto give Duroy innumerable orders, although everything had been arranged\nwith M. Walter. When Georges left him, he pressed his comrade's hand\nand said:\n\n\"Well, old fellow, we shall soon meet again.\"\n\nMme. Forestier accompanied him to the door and he reminded her of their\ncompact. \"We are friends and allies, are we not? If you should require\nmy services in any way, do not hesitate to call upon me. Send me a\ndispatch or a letter and I will obey.\"\n\nShe murmured: \"Thank you, I shall not forget.\"\n\nAs Duroy descended the staircase, he met M. de Vaudrec ascending. The\nCount seemed sad--perhaps at the approaching departure.\n\nThe journalist bowed, the Count returned his salutation courteously but\nsomewhat haughtily.\n\nOn Thursday evening the Forestiers left town.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nA DUEL WITH AN END\n\n\nCharles's absence gave Duroy a more important position on \"La Vie\nFrancaise.\" Only one matter arose to annoy him, otherwise his sky was\ncloudless.\n\nAn insignificant paper, \"La Plume,\" attacked him constantly, or rather\nattacked the editor of the \"Echoes\" of \"La Vie Francaise.\"\n\nJacques Rival said to him one day: \"You are very forbearing.\"\n\n\"What should I do? It is no direct attack.\"\n\nBut, one afternoon when he entered the office, Boisrenard handed him a\nnumber of \"La Plume.\"\n\n\"See, here is another unpleasant remark for you.\"\n\n\"Relative to what?\"\n\n\"To the arrest of one Dame Aubert.\"\n\nGeorges took the paper and read a scathing personal denunciation.\nDuroy, it seems, had written an item claiming that Dame Aubert who, as\nthe editor of \"La Plume,\" claimed, had been put under arrest, was a\nmyth. The latter retaliated by accusing Duroy of receiving bribes and\nof suppressing matter that should be published.\n\nAs Saint-Potin entered, Duroy asked him: \"Have you seen the paragraph\nin 'La Plume'?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I have just come from Dame Aubert's; she is no myth, but she\nhas not been arrested; that report has no foundation.\"\n\nDuroy went at once to M. Walter's office. After hearing the case, the\nmanager bade him go to the woman's house himself, find out the details,\nand reply, to the article.\n\nDuroy set out upon his errand and on his return to the office, wrote\nthe following:\n\n    \"An anonymous writer in 'La Plume' is trying to pick a quarrel\n     with me on the subject of an old woman who, he claims, was\n     arrested for disorderly conduct, which I deny. I have myself\n     seen Dame Aubert, who is sixty years old at least; she told me\n     the particulars of her dispute with a butcher as to the weight\n     of some cutlets, which dispute necessitated an explanation\n     before a magistrate. That is the whole truth in a nutshell. As\n     for the other insinuations I scorn them. One never should reply\n     to such things, moreover, when they are written under a mask.\n                                               GEORGES DUROY.\"\n\nM. Walter and Jacques Rival considered that sufficient, and it was\ndecided that it should be published in that day's issue.\n\nDuroy returned home rather agitated and uneasy. What would this\nopponent reply? Who was he? Why that attack? He passed a restless\nnight. When he re-read his article in the paper the next morning, he\nthought it more aggressive in print than it was in writing. He might,\nit seemed to him, have softened certain terms. He was excited all day\nand feverish during-the night. He rose early to obtain an issue of \"La\nPlume\" which should contain the reply to his note. He ran his eyes over\nthe columns and at first saw nothing. He was beginning to breathe more\nfreely when these words met his eye:\n\n    \"M. Duroy of 'La Vie Francaise' gives us the lie! In doing so,\n     he lies. He owns, however, that a woman named Aubert exists,\n     and that she was taken before a magistrate by an agent. Two\n     words only remain to be added to the word 'agent,' which are\n    'of morals' and all is told. But the consciences of certain\n     journalists are on a par with their talents.\"\n\n    \"I sign myself, Louis Langremont.\"\n\nGeorges's heart throbbed violently, and he returned home in order to\ndress himself. He had been insulted and in such a manner that it was\nimpossible to hesitate. Why had he been insulted? For nothing! On\naccount of an old woman who had quarreled with her butcher.\n\nHe dressed hastily and repaired to M. Walter's house, although it was\nscarcely eight o'clock. M. Walter was reading \"La Plume.\"\n\n\"Well,\" he said gravely, on perceiving Duroy, \"you cannot let that\npass.\" The young man did not reply.\n\nThe manager continued: \"Go at once in search of Rival, who will look\nafter your interests.\"\n\nDuroy stammered several vague words and set out for Rival's house.\nJacques was still in bed, but he rose when the bell rang, and having\nread the insulting paragraph, said: \"Whom would you like to have\nbesides me?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"Boisrenard?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Are you a good swordsman?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"A good shot?\"\n\n\"I have used a pistol a good deal.\"\n\n\"Good! Come and exercise while I attend to everything. Wait a moment.\"\n\nHe entered his dressing-room and soon reappeared, washed, shaven, and\npresentable.\n\n\"Come with me,\" said he. He lived on the ground floor, and he led Duroy\ninto a cellar converted into a room for the practice of fencing and\nshooting. He produced a pair of pistols and began to give his orders as\nbriefly as if they were on the dueling ground. He was well satisfied\nwith Duroy's use of the weapons, and told him to remain there and\npractice until noon, when he would return to take him to lunch and tell\nhim the result of his mission. Left to his own devices, Duroy aimed at\nthe target several times and then sat down to reflect.\n\nSuch affairs were abominable anyway! What would a respectable man gain\nby risking his life? And he recalled Norbert de Varenne's remarks, made\nto him a short while before. \"He was right!\" he declared aloud. It was\ngloomy in that cellar, as gloomy as in a tomb. What o'clock was it? The\ntime dragged slowly on. Suddenly he heard footsteps, voices, and\nJacques Rival reappeared accompanied by Boisrenard. The former cried on\nperceiving Duroy: \"All is settled!\"\n\nDuroy thought the matter had terminated with a letter of apology; his\nheart gave a bound and he stammered: \"Ah--thank you!\"\n\nRival continued: \"M. Langremont has accepted every condition.\nTwenty-five paces, fire when the pistol is leveled and the order\ngiven.\" Then he added: \"Now let us lunch; it is past twelve o'clock.\"\n\nThey repaired to a neighboring restaurant. Duroy was silent. He ate\nthat they might not think he was frightened, and went in the afternoon\nwith Boisrenard to the office, where he worked in an absent, mechanical\nmanner. Before leaving, Jacques Rival shook hands with him and warned\nhim that he and Boisrenard would call for him in a carriage the next\nmorning at seven o'clock to repair to the wood at Vesinet, where the\nmeeting was to take place.\n\nAll had been settled without his saying a word, giving his opinion,\naccepting or refusing, with such rapidity that his brain whirled and he\nscarcely knew what was taking place. He returned home about nine\no'clock in the evening after having dined with Boisrenard, who had not\nleft him all day. When he was alone, he paced the floor; he was too\nconfused to think. One thought alone filled his mind and that was: a\nduel to-morrow! He sat down and began to meditate. He had thrown upon\nhis table his adversary's card brought him by Rival. He read it for the\ntwentieth time that day:\n\n    \"Louis LANGREMONT,\n     176 Rue Montmartre.\"\n\nNothing more! Who was the man? How old was he? How tall? How did he\nlook? How odious that a total stranger should without rhyme or reason,\nout of pure caprice, annoy him thus on account of an old, woman's\nquarrel with her butcher! He said aloud: \"The brute!\" and glared\nangrily at the card.\n\nHe began to feel nervous; the sound of his voice made him start; he\ndrank a glass of water and laid down. He turned from his right side to\nhis left uneasily. He was thirsty; he rose, he felt restless.\n\n\"Am I afraid?\" he asked himself.\n\nWhy did his heart palpitate so wildly at the slightest sound? He began\nto reason philosophically on the possibility of being afraid. No,\ncertainly he was not, since he was ready to fight. Still he felt so\ndeeply moved that he wondered if one could be afraid in spite of\noneself. What would happen if that state of things should exist? If he\nshould tremble or lose his presence of mind? He lighted his candle and\nlooked in the glass; he scarcely recognized his own face, it was so\nchanged.\n\nSuddenly he thought: \"To-morrow at this time I may be dead.\" He turned\nto his couch and saw himself stretched lifeless upon it. He hastened to\nthe window and opened it; but the night air was so chilly that he\nclosed it, lighted a fire, and began to pace the floor once more,\nsaying mechanically: \"I must be more composed. I will write to my\nparents, in case of accident.\" He took a sheet of paper and after\nseveral attempts began:\n\n     \"My dear father and mother:\"\n\n     \"At daybreak I am going to fight a duel, and as something\n     might happen--\"\n\nHe could write no more, he rose with a shudder. It seemed to him that\nnotwithstanding his efforts, he would not have the strength necessary\nto face the meeting. He wondered if his adversary had ever fought\nbefore; if he were known? He had never heard his name. However, if he\nhad not been a remarkable shot, he would not have accepted that\ndangerous weapon without hesitation. He ground his teeth to prevent his\ncrying aloud. Suddenly he remembered that he had a bottle of brandy; he\nfetched it from the cupboard and soon emptied it. Now he felt his blood\ncourse more warmly through his veins. \"I have found a means,\" said he.\n\nDay broke. He began to dress; when his heart failed him, he took more\nbrandy. At length there was a knock at the door. His friends had come;\nthey were wrapped in furs. After shaking hands, Rival said: \"It is as\ncold as Siberia. Is all well?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Are you calm?\"\n\n\"Very calm.\"\n\n\"Have you eaten and drunk something?\"\n\n\"I do not need anything.\"\n\nThey descended the stairs. A gentleman was seated in the carriage.\nRival said: \"Dr. Le Brument.\" Duroy shook hands with him and stammered:\n\"Thank you,\" as he entered the carriage. Jacques Rival and Boisrenard\nfollowed him, and the coachman drove off. He knew where to go.\n\nThe conversation flagged, although the doctor related a number of\nanecdotes. Rival alone replied to him. Duroy tried to appear\nself-possessed, but he was haunted continually by the fear of showing\nhis feelings or of losing his self-possession. Rival addressed him,\nsaying: \"I took the pistols to Gastine Renette. He loaded them. The box\nis sealed.\"\n\nDuroy replied mechanically: \"Thank you.\"\n\nThen Rival proceeded to give him minute directions, that he might make\nno mistakes. Duroy repeated those directions as children learn their\nlessons in order to impress them upon his memory. As he muttered the\nphrases over and over, he almost prayed that some accident might happen\nto the carriage; if he could only break his leg!\n\nAt the end of a glade he saw a carriage standing and four gentlemen\nstamping their feet in order to keep them warm, and he was obliged to\ngasp in order to get breath. Rival and Boisrenard alighted first, then\nthe doctor and the combatant.\n\nRival took the box of pistols, and with Boisrenard approached the two\nstrangers, who were advancing toward them. Duroy saw them greet one\nanother ceremoniously, then walk through the glade together as they\ncounted the paces.\n\nDr. Le Brument asked Duroy: \"Do you feel well? Do you not want\nanything?\"\n\n\"Nothing, thank you.\" It seemed to him that he was asleep, that he was\ndreaming. Was he afraid? He did not know. Jacques Rival returned and\nsaid in a low voice: \"All is ready. Fortune has favored us in the\ndrawing of the pistols.\" That was a matter of indifference to Duroy.\nThey helped him off with his overcoat, led him to the ground set apart\nfor the duel, and gave him his pistol. Before him stood a man, short,\nstout, and bald, who wore glasses. That was his adversary. A voice\nbroke the silence--a voice which came from afar: \"Are you ready, sirs?\"\n\nGeorges cried: \"Yes.\"\n\nThe same voice commanded: \"Fire!\"\n\nDuroy heard nothing more, saw nothing more; he only knew that he raised\nhis arm and pressed with all his strength upon the trigger. Soon he saw\na little smoke before him; his opponent was still standing in the same\nposition, and there was a small white cloud above his head. They had\nboth fired. All was over! His second and the doctor felt him,\nunbuttoned his garments, and asked anxiously: \"Are you wounded?\" He\nreplied: \"No, I think not.\"\n\nLangremont was not wounded either, and Jacques Rival muttered\ndiscontentedly: \"That is always the way with those cursed pistols, one\neither misses or kills one's opponent.\"\n\nDuroy was paralyzed with surprise and joy. All was over! He felt that\nhe could fight the entire universe. All was over! What bliss! He felt\nbrave enough to provoke anyone. The seconds consulted several moments,\nthen the duelists and their friends entered the carriages and drove\noff. When the official report was drawn up, it was handed to Duroy who\nwas to insert it in the \"Echoes.\" He was surprised to find that two\nballs had been fired.\n\nHe said to Rival: \"We only fired once!\"\n\nThe latter smiled: \"Yes--once--once each--that makes twice!\"\n\nAnd Duroy, satisfied with that explanation, asked no more questions. M.\nWalter embraced him.\n\n\"Bravo! you have defended the colors of 'La Vie Francaise'! Bravo!\"\n\nThe following day at eleven o'clock in the forenoon, Duroy received a\ntelegram:\n\n\"My God! I have been frightened. Come at once to Rue de Constantinople\nthat I may embrace you, my love. How brave you are. I adore you. Clo.\"\n\nHe repaired to the place appointed, and Mme. de Marelle rushed into his\narms, covering him with kisses.\n\n\"Oh, my darling, if you only knew how I felt when I read the morning\npapers! Tell me, tell me all about it.\"\n\nDuroy was obliged to give her a detailed account.\n\n\"You must have had a terrible night before the duel!\"\n\n\"Why, no; I slept very well.\"\n\n\"I should not have closed my eyes. Tell me what took place on the\nground.\"\n\nForthwith he proceeded to give her a graphic description of the duel.\nWhen he had concluded, she said to him: \"I cannot live without you! I\nmust see you, and with my husband in Paris it is not very convenient. I\noften have an hour early in the morning when I could come and embrace\nyou, but I cannot enter that horrible house of yours! What can we do?\"\n\nHe asked abruptly: \"How much do you pay here?\"\n\n\"One hundred francs a month.\"\n\n\"Very well, I will take the apartments on my own account, and I will\nmove at once. Mine are not suitable anyway for me now.\"\n\nShe thought a moment and then replied: \"No I do not want you to.\"\n\nHe asked in surprise: \"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because!\"\n\n\"That is no reason. These rooms suit me very well. I am here; I shall\nremain.\" He laughed. \"Moreover, they were hired in my name!\"\n\nBut she persisted: \"No, no, I do not wish you to.\"\n\n\"Why not, then?\"\n\nShe whispered softly, tenderly: \"Because you would bring others here,\nand I do not wish you to.\"\n\nIndignantly he cried: \"Never, I promise you!\"\n\n\"You would do so in spite of your promise.\"\n\n\"I swear I will not.\"\n\n\"Truly?\"\n\n\"Truly--upon my word of honor. This is our nest--ours alone!\"\n\nShe embraced him in a transport of delight. \"Then I agree, my dearest.\nBut if you deceive me once--just once, that will end all between us\nforever.\"\n\nHe protested, and it was agreed that he should settle in the rooms that\nsame day. She said to him:\n\n\"You must dine with us Sunday. My husband thinks you charming.\"\n\nHe was flattered. \"Indeed?\"\n\n\"Yes, you have made a conquest. Did you not tell me that your home was\nin the country?\"\n\n\"Yes; why?\"\n\n\"Then you know something about agriculture?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Very well; talk to him of gardening and crops; he enjoys those\nsubjects.\"\n\n\"All right. I shall not forget.\"\n\nShe left him, after lavishing upon him innumerable caresses.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nDEATH AND A PROPOSAL\n\n\nDuroy moved his effects to the apartments in Rue de Constantinople. Two\nor three times a week, Mme. de-Marelle paid him visits. Duroy, to\ncounterbalance them, dined at her house every Thursday, and delighted\nher husband by talking agriculture to him.\n\nIt was almost the end of February. Duroy was free from care. One night,\nwhen he returned home, he found a letter under his door. He examined\nthe postmark; it was from Cannes. Having opened it, he read:\n\n     \"Cannes, Villa Jolie.\"\n\n     \"Dear sir and friend: You told me, did you not, that I could\n     count upon you at any time? Very well. I have a favor to ask\n     of you; it is to come and help me--not to leave me alone during\n     Charles's last moments. He may not live through the week,\n     although he is not confined to his bed, but the doctor has\n     warned me. I have not the strength nor the courage to see that\n     agony day and night, and I think with terror of the approaching\n     end I can only ask such a thing of you, for my husband has no\n     relatives. You were his comrade; he helped you to your\n     position; come, I beg of you; I have no one else to ask.\"\n\n     \"Your friend,\"\n\n     \"Madeleine Forestier.\"\n\nGeorges murmured: \"Certainly I will go. Poor Charles!\"\n\nThe manager, to whom he communicated the contents of that letter,\ngrumblingly gave his consent. He repeated: \"But return speedily, you\nare indispensable to us.\"\n\nGeorges Duroy left for Cannes the next day by the seven o'clock\nexpress, after having warned Mme. de Marelle by telegram. He arrived\nthe following day at four o'clock in the afternoon. A commissionnaire\nconducted him to Villa Jolie. The house was small and low, and of the\nItalian style of architecture.\n\nA servant opened the door and cried: \"Oh, sir, Madame is awaiting you\npatiently.\"\n\nDuroy asked: \"How is your master?\"\n\n\"Not very well, sir. He will not be here long.\"\n\nThe floor of the drawing-room which the young man entered was covered\nwith a Persian rug; the large windows looked upon the village and the\nsea.\n\nDuroy murmured: \"How cozy it is here! Where the deuce do they get the\nmoney from?\"\n\nThe rustling of a gown caused him to turn. Mme. Forestier extended both\nher hands, saying:\n\n\"How kind of you to come.\"\n\nShe was a trifle paler and thinner, but still as bright as ever, and\nperhaps prettier for being more delicate. She whispered: \"It is\nterrible--he knows he cannot be saved and he tyrannizes over me. I have\ntold him of your arrival. But where is your trunk?\"\n\nDuroy replied: \"I left it at the station, not knowing which hotel you\nwould advise me to stop at, in order to be near you.\"\n\nShe hesitated, then said: \"You must stop here, at the villa. Your\nchamber is ready. He might die any moment, and if it should come in the\nnight, I would be alone. I will send for your luggage.\"\n\nHe bowed. \"As you will.\"\n\n\"Now, let us go upstairs,\" said she; he followed her. She opened a door\non the first floor, and Duroy saw a form near a window, seated in an\neasy-chair, and wrapped in coverlets. He divined that it was his\nfriend, though he scarcely recognized him. Forestier raised his hand\nslowly and with difficulty, saying:\n\n\"You are here; you have come to see me die. I am much obliged.\"\n\nDuroy forced a smile. \"To see you die? That would not be a very\npleasant sight, and I would not choose that occasion on which to visit\nCannes. I came here to rest.\"\n\n\"Sit down,\" said Forestier, and he bowed his head as if deep in\nhopeless meditation. Seeing that he did not speak, his wife approached\nthe window and pointing to the horizon, said, \"Look at that? Is it not\nbeautiful?\"\n\nIn spite of himself Duroy felt the grandeur of the closing day and\nexclaimed: \"Yes, indeed, it is magnificent.\"\n\nForestier raised his head and said to his wife: \"Give me more air.\"\n\nShe replied: \"You must be careful; it is late, the sun is setting; you\nwill catch more cold and that would be a serious thing in your\ncondition.\"\n\nHe made a feeble gesture of anger with his right hand, and said: \"I\ntell you I am suffocating! What difference does it make if I die a day\nsooner or later, since I must die?\"\n\nShe opened the window wide. The air was soft and balmy. Forestier\ninhaled it in feverish gasps. He grasped the arms of his chair and said\nin a low voice: \"Shut the window. I would rather die in a cellar.\"\n\nHis wife slowly closed the window, then leaned her brow against the\npane and looked out. Duroy, ill at ease, wished to converse with the\ninvalid to reassure him, but he could think of no words of comfort. He\nstammered: \"Have you not been better since you are here?\"\n\nHis friend shrugged his shoulders impatiently: \"You will see very\nsoon.\" And he bowed his head again.\n\nDuroy continued: \"At home it is still wintry. It snows, hails, rains,\nand is so dark that they have to light the lamps at three o'clock in\nthe afternoon.\"\n\nForestier asked: \"Is there anything new at the office?\"\n\n\"Nothing. They have taken little Lacrin of the 'Voltaire' to fill your\nplace, but he is incapable. It is time you came back.\"\n\nThe invalid muttered: \"I? I will soon be writing under six feet of\nsod.\" A long silence ensued.\n\nMme. Forestier did not stir; she stood with her back to the room, her\nface toward the window. At length Forestier broke the silence in a\ngasping voice, heartrending to listen to: \"How many more sunsets shall\nI see--eight--ten--fifteen--twenty--or perhaps thirty--no more. You\nhave more time, you two--as for me--all is at an end. And everything\nwill go on when I am gone as if I were here.\" He paused a few moments,\nthen continued: \"Everything that I see reminds me that I shall not see\nthem long. It is horrible. I shall no longer see the smallest\nobjects--the glasses--the dishes--the beds on which we rest--the\ncarriages. It is fine to drive in the evening. How I loved all that.\"\n\nAgain Norbert de Varenne's words occurred to Duroy. The room grew dark.\nForestier asked irritably:\n\n\"Are we to have no lamp to-night? That is what is called caring for an\ninvalid!\"\n\nThe form outlined against the window disappeared and an electric bell\nwas heard to ring. A servant soon entered and placed a lamp upon the\nmantel-piece. Mme. Forestier asked her husband: \"Do you wish to retire,\nor will you go downstairs to dinner?\"\n\n\"I will go down to dinner.\"\n\nThe meal seemed to Duroy interminable, for there was no conversation,\nonly the ticking of a clock broke the silence. When they had finished,\nDuroy, pleading fatigue, retired to his room and tried in vain to\ninvent some pretext for returning home as quickly as possible. He\nconsoled himself by saying: \"Perhaps it will not be for long.\"\n\nThe next morning Georges rose early and strolled down to the beach.\nWhen he returned the servant said to him: \"Monsieur has asked for you\ntwo or three times. Will you go upstairs?\"\n\nHe ascended the stairs. Forestier appeared to be in a chair; his wife,\nreclining upon a couch, was reading. The invalid raised his head. Duroy\nasked:\n\n\"Well, how are you? You look better this morning.\"\n\nForestier murmured: \"Yes, I am better and stronger. Lunch as hastily as\nyou can with Madeleine, because we are going to take a drive.\"\n\nWhen Mme. Forestier was alone with Duroy, she said to him: \"You see,\nto-day he thinks he is better! He is making plans for to-morrow. We are\nnow going to Gulf Juan to buy pottery for our rooms in Paris. He is\ndetermined to go, but he cannot stand the jolting on the road.\"\n\nThe carriage arrived, Forestier descended the stairs, step by step,\nsupported by his servant. When he saw the closed landau, he wanted it\nuncovered. His wife opposed him: \"It is sheer madness! You will take\ncold.\"\n\nHe persisted: \"No, I am going to be better, I know it.\"\n\nThey first drove along a shady road and then took the road by the sea.\nForestier explained the different points of interest. Finally they\narrived at a pavilion over which were these words: \"Gulf Juan Art\nPottery,\" and the carriage drew up at the door. Forestier wanted to buy\na vase to put on his bookcase. As he could not leave the carriage, they\nbrought the pieces to him one by one. It took him a long time to\nchoose, consulting his wife and Duroy: \"You know it is for my study.\nFrom my easy-chair I can see it constantly. I prefer the ancient\nform--the Greek.\"\n\nAt length he made his choice. \"I shall return to Paris in a few days,\"\nsaid he.\n\nOn their way home along the gulf a cool breeze suddenly sprang up, and\nthe invalid began to cough. At first it was nothing, only a slight\nattack, but it grew worse and turned to a sort of hiccough--a rattle;\nForestier choked, and every time he tried to breathe he coughed\nviolently. Nothing quieted him. He had to be carried from the landau to\nhis room. The heat of the bed did not stop the attack, which lasted\nuntil midnight. The first words the sick man uttered were to ask for a\nbarber, for he insisted on being shaved every morning. He rose to be\nshaved, but was obliged to go to bed at once, and began to breathe so\npainfully that Mme. Forestier in affright woke Duroy and asked him to\nfetch the doctor. He returned almost immediately with Dr. Gavant who\nprescribed for the sick man. When the journalist asked him his opinion,\nhe said: \"It is the final stage. He will be dead to-morrow morning.\nPrepare that poor, young wife and send for a priest. I can do nothing\nmore. However, I am entirely at your disposal\" Duroy went to Mme.\nForestier. \"He is going to die. The doctor advises me to send for a\npriest. What will you do?\"\n\nShe hesitated a moment and then said slowly:\n\n\"I will go and tell him that the cure wishes to see him. Will you be\nkind enough to procure one who will require nothing but the confession,\nand who will not make much fuss?\"\n\nThe young man brought with him a kind, old priest who accommodated\nhimself to circumstances. When he had entered the death chamber, Mme.\nForestier went out and seated herself with Duroy in an adjoining room.\n\n\"That has upset him,\" said she. \"When I mentioned the priest to him,\nhis face assumed a scared expression. He knew that the end was near. I\nshall never forget his face.\"\n\nAt that moment they heard the priest saying to him: \"Why no, you are\nnot so low as that. You are ill, but not in danger. The proof of that\nis that I came as a friend, a neighbor.\" They could not hear his reply.\nThe priest continued: \"No, I shall not administer the sacrament. We\nwill speak of that when you are better. If you will only confess, I ask\nno more. I am a pastor; I take advantage of every occasion to gather in\nmy sheep.\"\n\nA long silence followed. Then suddenly the priest said, in the tone of\none officiating at the altar:\n\n\"The mercy of God is infinite; repeat the 'Confiteor,' my son. Perhaps\nyou have forgotten it; I will help you. Repeat with me: 'Confiteor Deo\nomnipotenti; Beata Mariae semper virgini.'\" He paused from time to time\nto permit the dying man to catch up to him.\n\nThen he said: \"Now, confess.\" The sick man murmured something. The\npriest repeated: \"You have committed sins: of what kind, my son?\"\n\nThe young woman rose and said simply: \"Let us go into the garden. We\nmust not listen to his secrets.\"\n\nThey seated themselves upon a bench before the door, beneath a\nblossoming rosebush. After several moments of silence Duroy asked:\n\"Will it be some time before you return to Paris?\"\n\n\"No,\" she replied; \"when all is over, I will go back.\"\n\n\"In about ten days?\"\n\n\"Yes, at most.\"\n\nHe continued; \"Charles has no relatives then?\"\n\n\"None, save cousins. His father and mother died when he was very young.\"\n\nIn the course of a few minutes, the servant came to tell them that the\npriest had finished, and together they ascended the stairs. Forestier\nseemed to have grown thinner since the preceding day. The priest was\nholding his hand.\n\n\"Au revoir, my son. I will come again to-morrow morning\"; and he left.\nWhen he was gone, the dying man, who was panting, tried to raise his\ntwo hands toward his wife and gasped:\n\n\"Save me--save me, my darling. I do not want to die--oh, save me--go\nfor the doctor. I will take anything. I do not want to die.\" He wept;\nthe tears coursed down his pallid cheeks. Then his hands commenced to\nwander hither and thither continually, slowly, and regularly, as if\ngathering something on the coverlet. His wife, who was also weeping,\nsobbed:\n\n\"No, it is nothing. It is only an attack; you will be better to-morrow;\nyou tired yourself with that drive.\"\n\nForestier drew his breath quickly and so faintly that one could\nscarcely hear him. He repeated:\n\n\"I do not want to die! Oh, my God--my God--what has happened to me? I\ncannot see. Oh, my God!\" His staring eyes saw something invisible to\nthe others; his hands plucked continually at the counterpane. Suddenly\nhe shuddered and gasped: \"The cemetery--me--my God!\" He did not speak\nagain. He lay there motionless and ghastly. The hours dragged on; the\nclock of a neighboring convent chimed noon.\n\nDuroy left the room to obtain some food. He returned an hour later;\nMme. Forestier would eat nothing. The invalid had not stirred. The\nyoung woman was seated in an easy-chair at the foot of the bed. Duroy\nlikewise seated himself, and they watched in silence. A nurse, sent by\nthe doctor, had arrived and was dozing by the window.\n\nDuroy himself was almost asleep when he felt a presentiment that\nsomething was about to happen. He opened his eyes just in time to see\nForestier close his. He coughed slightly, and two streams of blood\nissued from the corners of his mouth and flowed upon his night robe;\nhis hands ceased their perpetual motion; he had breathed his last. His\nwife, perceiving it, uttered a cry and fell upon her knees by the\nbedside. Georges, in surprise and affright, mechanically made the sign\nof the cross.\n\nThe nurse, awakening, approached the bed and said: \"It has come.\"\nDuroy, recovering his self-possession, murmured with a sigh of relief:\n\"It was not as hard as I feared it would be.\"\n\nThat night Mme. Forestier and Duroy watched in the chamber of death.\nThey were alone beside him who was no more. They did not speak,\nGeorges's eyes seemed attracted to that emaciated face which the\nflickering light made more hollow. That was his friend, Charles\nForestier, who the day before had spoken to him. For several years he\nhad lived, eaten, laughed, loved, and hoped as did everyone--and now\nall was ended for him forever.\n\nLife lasted a few months or years, and then fled! One was born, grew,\nwas happy, and died. Adieu! man or woman, you will never return to\nearth! He thought of the insects which live several hours, of the\nfeasts which live several days, of the men who live several years, of\nthe worlds which last several centuries. What was the difference\nbetween one and the other? A few more dawns, that was all.\n\nDuroy turned away his eyes in order not to see the corpse. Mme.\nForestier's head was bowed; her fair hair enhanced the beauty of her\nsorrowful face. The young man's heart grew hopeful. Why should he\nlament when he had so many years still before him? He glanced at the\nhandsome widow. How had she ever consented to marry that man? Then he\npondered upon all the hidden secrets of their lives. He remembered that\nhe had been told of a Count de Vaudrec who had dowered and given her in\nmarriage. What would she do now? Whom would she marry? Had she\nprojects, plans? He would have liked to know. Why that anxiety as to\nwhat she would do?\n\nGeorges questioned himself, and found that it was caused by a desire to\nwin her for himself. Why should he not succeed? He was positive that\nshe liked him; she would have confidence in him, for she knew that he\nwas intelligent, resolute, tenacious. Had she not sent for him? Was not\nthat a kind of avowal? He was impatient to question her, to find out\nher intentions. He would soon have to leave that villa, for he could\nnot remain alone with the young widow; therefore he must find out her\nplans before returning to Paris, in order that she might not yield to\nanother's entreaties. He broke the oppressive silence by saying:\n\n\"You must be fatigued.\"\n\n\"Yes, but above all I am grieved.\"\n\nTheir voices sounded strange in that room. They glanced involuntarily\nat the corpse as if they expected to see it move. Duroy continued:\n\n\"It is a heavy blow for you, and will make a complete change in your\nlife.\"\n\nShe sighed deeply, but did not reply. He added:\n\n\"It is very sad for a young woman like you to be left alone.\" He\npaused; she still did not reply, and he stammered: \"At any rate, you\nwill remember the compact between us; you can command me as you will. I\nam yours.\"\n\nShe held out her hand to him and said mournfully and gently: \"Thanks,\nyou are very kind. If I can do anything for you, I say too: 'Count on\nme.'\"\n\nHe took her proffered hand, gazed at it, and was seized with an ardent\ndesire to kiss it. Slowly he raised it to his lips and then\nrelinquished it. As her delicate fingers lay upon her knee the young\nwidow said gravely:\n\n\"Yes, I shall be all alone, but I shall force myself to be brave.\"\n\nHe did not know how to tell her that he would be delighted to wed her.\nCertainly it was no time to speak to her on such a subject; however, he\nthought he might be able to express himself by means of some phrase\nwhich would have a hidden meaning and would infer what he wished to\nsay. But that rigid corpse lay between them. The atmosphere became\noppressive, almost suffocating. Duroy asked: \"Can we not open the\nwindow a little? The air seems to be impure.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" she replied; \"I have noticed it too.\"\n\nHe opened the window, letting in the cool night air. He turned: \"Come\nand look out, it is delightful.\"\n\nShe glided softly to his side. He whispered: \"Listen to me. Do not be\nangry that I broach the subject at such a time, but the day after\nto-morrow I shall leave here and when you return to Paris it might be\ntoo late. You know that I am only a poor devil, who has his position to\nmake, but I have the will and some intelligence, and I am advancing. A\nman who has attained his ambition knows what to count on; a man who has\nhis way to make does not know what may come--it may be better or worse.\nI told you one day that my most cherished dream was to have a wife like\nyou.\"\n\n\"I repeat it to you to-day. Do not reply, but let me continue. This is\nno proposal--the time and place would render it odious. I only wish to\ntell you that by a word you can make me happy, and that you can make of\nme as you will, either a friend or a husband--for my heart and my body\nare yours. I do not want you to answer me now. I do not wish to speak\nany more on the subject here. When we meet in Paris, you can tell me\nyour decision.\"\n\nHe uttered these words without glancing at her, and she seemed not to\nhave heard them, for she stood by his side motionless, staring vaguely\nand fixedly at the landscape before her, bathed in moonlight.\n\nAt length she murmured: \"It is rather chilly,\" and turned toward the\nbed. Duroy followed her. They did not speak but continued their watch.\nToward midnight Georges fell asleep. At daybreak the nurse entered and\nhe started up. Both he and Mme. Forestier retired to their rooms to\nobtain some rest. At eleven o'clock they rose and lunched together;\nwhile through the open window was wafted the sweet, perfumed air of\nspring. After lunch, Mme. Forestier proposed that they take a turn in\nthe garden; as they walked slowly along, she suddenly said, without\nturning her head toward him, in a low, grave voice:\n\n\"Listen to me, my dear friend; I have already reflected upon what you\nproposed to me, and I cannot allow you to depart without a word of\nreply. I will, however, say neither yes nor no. We will wait, we will\nsee; we will become better acquainted. You must think it well over too.\nDo not yield to an impulse. I mention this to you before even poor\nCharles is buried, because it is necessary, after what you have said to\nme, that you should know me as I am, in order not to cherish the hope\nyou expressed to me any longer, if you are not a man who can understand\nand bear with me.\"\n\n\"Now listen carefully: Marriage, to me, is not a chain but an\nassociation. I must be free, entirely unfettered, in all my actions--my\ncoming and my going; I can tolerate neither control, jealousy, nor\ncriticism as to my conduct. I pledge my word, however, never to\ncompromise the name of the man I marry, nor to render him ridiculous in\nthe eyes of the world. But that man must promise to look upon me as an\nequal, an ally, and not as an inferior, or as an obedient, submissive\nwife. My ideas, I know, are not like those of other people, but I shall\nnever change them. Do not answer me, it would be useless. We shall meet\nagain and talk it all over later. Now take a walk; I shall return to\nhim. Good-bye until to-night.\"\n\nHe kissed her hand and left her without having uttered a word. That\nnight they met at dinner; directly after the meal they sought their\nrooms, worn out with fatigue.\n\nCharles Forestier was buried the next day in the cemetery at Cannes\nwithout any pomp, and Georges returned to Paris by the express which\nleft at one-thirty. Mme. Forestier accompanied him to the station. They\nwalked up and down the platform awaiting the hour of departure and\nconversing on indifferent subjects.\n\nThe train arrived, the journalist took his seat; a porter cried:\n\"Marseilles, Lyons, Paris! All aboard!\" The locomotive whistled and the\ntrain moved slowly out of the station.\n\nThe young man leaned out of the carriage, and looked at the youthful\nwidow standing on the platform gazing after him. Just as she was\ndisappearing from his sight, he threw her a kiss, which she returned\nwith a more discreet wave of her hand.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nMARRIAGE\n\n\nGeorges Duroy resumed his old habits. Installed in the cozy apartments\non Rue de Constantinople, his relations with Mme. de Marelle became\nquite conjugal.\n\nMme. Forestier had not returned; she lingered at Cannes. He, however,\nreceived a letter from her announcing her return about the middle of\nApril, but containing not a word as to their parting. He waited. He was\nresolved to employ every means to marry her if she seemed to hesitate;\nhe had faith in his good fortune, in that power of attraction which he\nfelt within him--a power so irresistible that all women yielded to it.\n\nAt length a short note admonished him that the decisive moment had\narrived.\n\n     \"I am in Paris. Come to see me.\"\n\n     \"Madeleine Forestier.\"\n\nNothing more. He received it at nine o'clock. At three o'clock of the\nsame day he called at her house. She extended both hands to him with a\nsweet smile, and they gazed into each other's eyes for several seconds,\nthen she murmured:\n\n\"How kind of you to come!\"\n\nHe replied: \"I should have come, whensoever you bade me.\"\n\nThey sat down; she inquired about the Walters, his associates, and the\nnewspaper.\n\n\"I miss that very much,\" said she. \"I had become a journalist in\nspirit. I like the profession.\" She paused. He fancied he saw in her\nsmile, in her voice, in her words, a kind of invitation, and although\nhe had resolved not to hasten matters, he stammered:\n\n\"Well--why--why do you not resume--that profession--under--the name of\nDuroy?\"\n\nShe became suddenly serious, and placing her hand on his arm, she said:\n\"Do not let us speak of that yet.\"\n\nDivining that she would accept him, he fell upon his knees, and\npassionately kissed her hands, saying:\n\n\"Thank you--thank you--how I love you.\"\n\nShe rose, she was very pale. Duroy kissed her brow. When she had\ndisengaged herself from his embrace, she said gravely: \"Listen, my\nfriend, I have not yet fully decided; but my answer may be 'yes.' You\nmust wait patiently, however, until I disclose the secret to you.\"\n\nHe promised and left her, his heart overflowing with joy. He worked\nsteadily, spent little, tried to save some money that he might not be\nwithout a sou at the time of his marriage, and became as miserly as he\nhad once been prodigal. Summer glided by; then autumn, and no one\nsuspected the tie existing between Duroy and Mme. Forestier, for they\nseldom met in public.\n\nOne evening Madeleine said to him: \"You have not yet told Mme. de\nMarelle our plans?\"\n\n\"No, my dear; as you wished them kept secret, I have not mentioned them\nto a soul.\"\n\n\"Very well; there is plenty of time. I will tell the Walters.\"\n\nShe turned away her head and continued: \"If you wish, we can be married\nthe beginning of May.\"\n\n\"I obey you in all things joyfully.\"\n\n\"The tenth of May, which falls on Saturday, would please me, for it is\nmy birthday.\"\n\n\"Very well, the tenth of May.\"\n\n\"Your parents live near Rouen, do they not?\"\n\n\"Yes, near Rouen, at Canteleu.\"\n\n\"I am very anxious to see them!\"\n\nHe hesitated, perplexed: \"But--they are--\" Then he added more firmly:\n\"My dear, they are plain, country people, innkeepers, who strained\nevery nerve to give me an education. I am not ashamed of them, but\ntheir--simplicity--their rusticity might annoy you.\"\n\nShe smiled sweetly. \"No, I will love them very much. We will visit\nthem; I wish to. I, too, am the child of humble parents--but I lost\nmine--I have no one in the world\"--she held out her hand to him--\"but\nyou.\"\n\nHe was affected, conquered as he had never been by any woman.\n\n\"I have been thinking of something,\" said she, \"but it is difficult to\nexplain.\"\n\nHe asked: \"What is it?\"\n\n\"It is this: I am like all women. I have my--my weaknesses. I should\nlike to bear a noble name. Can you not on the occasion of our marriage\nchange your name somewhat?\" She blushed as if she had proposed\nsomething indelicate.\n\nHe replied simply: \"I have often thought of it, but it does not seem\neasy to me.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nHe laughed. \"Because I am afraid I should be ridiculed.\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders. \"Not at all--not at all. Everyone does it,\nand no one laughs. Separate your name in this way: Du Roy. It sounds\nvery well.\"\n\nHe replied: \"No, that will not do; it is too common a proceeding. I\nhave thought of assuming the name of my native place, first as a\nliterary pseudonym and then as my surname in conjunction with Duroy,\nwhich might later on, as you proposed, be separated.\"\n\nShe asked: \"Is your native place Canteleu?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I do not like the termination. Could we not modify it?\"\n\nShe took a pen and wrote down the names in order to study them.\nSuddenly she cried: \"Now I have it,\" and held toward him a sheet of\npaper on which was written: \"Mme. Duroy de Cantel.\"\n\nGravely he replied: \"Yes, it is very nice.\"\n\nShe was delighted, and repeated: \"Duroy de Cantel. Mme. Duroy de\nCantel. It is excellent, excellent!\"\n\nThen she added with an air of conviction: \"You will see how easily it\nwill be accepted by everyone! After to-morrow, sign your articles 'D.\nde Cantel,' and your 'Echoes' simply 'Duroy.' That is done on the press\nevery day and no one will be surprised to see you take a nom de plume.\nWhat is your father's name?\"\n\n\"Alexandre.\"\n\nShe murmured \"Alexandre!\" two or three times in succession; then she\nwrote upon a blank sheet:\n\n\"M. and Mme. Alexandre du Roy de Cantel announce the marriage of their\nson, M. Georges du Roy de Cantel with Mme. Forestier.\"\n\nShe examined her writing, and, charmed with the effect, exclaimed:\n\"With a little method one can succeed in anything.\"\n\nWhen Georges reached the street resolved to call himself, henceforth,\n\"Du Roy,\" or even \"Du Roy de Cantel,\" it seemed to him that he was of\nmore importance. He swaggered more boldly, held his head more erect and\nwalked as he thought gentlemen should. He felt a desire to inform the\npassers-by, \"My name is Du Roy de Cantel.\"\n\nScarcely had he entered his apartments when the thought of Mme. de\nMarelle rendered him uneasy, and he wrote to her immediately,\nappointing a meeting for the following day.\n\n\"It will be hard,\" thought he. \"There will be a quarrel surely.\"\n\nThe next morning he received a telegram from Madame, informing him that\nshe would be with him at one o'clock. He awaited her impatiently,\ndetermined to confess at once and afterward to argue with her, to tell\nher that he could not remain a bachelor indefinitely, and that, as M.\nde Marelle persisted in living, he had been compelled to choose some\none else as a legal companion. When the bell rang, his heart gave a\nbound.\n\nMme. de Marelle entered and cast herself into his arms, saying: \"Good\nafternoon, Bel-Ami.\" Perceiving that his embrace was colder than usual,\nshe glanced up at him and asked: \"What ails you?\"\n\n\"Take a seat,\" said he. \"We must talk seriously.\"\n\nShe seated herself without removing her hat, and waited. He cast down\nhis eyes; he was preparing to commence.\n\nFinally he said slowly: \"My dear friend, you see that I am very much\nperplexed, very sad, and very much embarrassed by what I have to\nconfess to you. I love you; I love you with all my heart, and the fear\nof giving you pain grieves me more than what I have to tell you.\"\n\nShe turned pale, trembled, and asked: \"What is it? Tell me quickly.\"\n\nHe said sadly but resolutely: \"I am going to be married.\"\n\nShe sighed like one about to lose consciousness; then she gasped, but\ndid not speak.\n\nHe continued: \"You cannot imagine how much I suffered before taking\nthat resolution. But I have neither position nor money. I am alone in\nParis, I must have near me some one who can counsel, comfort, and\nsupport me. What I need is an associate, an ally, and I have found\none!\" He paused, hoping that she would reply, expecting an outburst of\nfurious rage, reproaches, and insults. She pressed her hand to her\nheart and breathed with difficulty. He took the hand resting on the arm\nof the chair, but she drew it away and murmured as if stupefied: \"Oh,\nmy God!\"\n\nHe fell upon his knees before her, without, however, venturing to touch\nher, more moved by her silence than he would have been by her anger.\n\n\"Clo, my little Clo, you understand my position. Oh, if I could have\nmarried you, what happiness it would have afforded me! But you were\nmarried! What could I do? Just think of it! I must make my way in the\nworld and I can never do so as long as I have no domestic ties. If you\nknew. There are days when I should like to kill your husband.\" He spoke\nin a low, seductive voice. He saw two tears gather in Mme. de Marelle's\neyes and trickle slowly down her cheeks. He whispered: \"Do not weep,\nClo, do not weep, I beseech you. You break my heart.\"\n\nShe made an effort to appear dignified and haughty, and asked, though\nsomewhat unsteadily: \"Who is it?\"\n\nFor a moment he hesitated before he replied: \"Madeleine Forestier!\"\n\nMme. de Marelle started; her tears continued to flow. She rose. Duroy\nsaw that she was going to leave him without a word of reproach or\npardon, and he felt humbled, humiliated. He seized her gown and\nimplored:\n\n\"Do not leave me thus.\"\n\nShe looked at him with that despairing, tearful glance so charming and\nso touching, which expresses all the misery pent-up in a woman's heart,\nand stammered: \"I have nothing--to say; I can do nothing. You--you are\nright; you have made a good choice.\"\n\nAnd disengaging herself she left the room.\n\nWith a sigh of relief at escaping so easily, he repaired to Mme.\nForestier's, who asked him: \"Have you told Mme. de Marelle?\"\n\nHe replied calmly: \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Did it affect her?\"\n\n\"Not at all. On the contrary, she thought it an excellent plan.\"\n\nThe news was soon noised abroad. Some were surprised, others pretended\nto have foreseen it, and others again smiled, inferring that they were\nnot at all astonished. The young man, who signed his articles, \"D. de\nCantel,\" his \"Echoes,\" \"Duroy,\" and his political sketches, \"Du Roy,\"\nspent the best part of his time with his betrothed, who had decided\nthat the date fixed for the wedding should be kept secret, that the\nceremony should be celebrated in the presence of witnesses only, that\nthey should leave the same evening for Rouen, and that the day\nfollowing they should visit the journalist's aged parents and spend\nseveral days with them. Duroy had tried to persuade Madeleine to\nabandon that project, but not succeeding in his efforts he was finally\ncompelled to submit.\n\nThe tenth of May arrived. Thinking a religious ceremony unnecessary, as\nthey had issued no invitations, the couple were married at a\nmagistrate's and took the six o'clock train for Normandy.\n\nAs the train glided along, Duroy seated in front of his wife, took her\nhand, kissed it, and said: \"When we return we will dine at Chatou\nsometimes.\"\n\nShe murmured: \"We shall have a great many things to do!\" in a tone\nwhich seemed to say: \"We must sacrifice pleasure to duty.\"\n\nHe retained her hand wondering anxiously how he could manage to caress\nher. He pressed her hand slightly, but she did not respond to the\npressure.\n\nHe said: \"It seems strange that you should be my wife.\"\n\nShe appeared surprised: \"Why?\"\n\n\"I do not know. It seems droll. I want to embrace you and I am\nsurprised that I have the right.\"\n\nShe calmly offered him her cheek which he kissed as he would have\nkissed his sister's. He continued:\n\n\"The first time I saw you (you remember, at that dinner to which I was\ninvited at Forestier's), I thought: 'Sacristi, if I could only find a\nwife like that!' And now I have one.\"\n\nShe glanced at him with smiling eyes.\n\nHe said to himself: \"I am too cold. I am stupid. I should make more\nadvances.\" And he asked: \"How did you make Forestier's acquaintance?\"\n\nShe replied with provoking archness: \"Are we going to Rouen to talk of\nhim?\"\n\nHe colored. \"I am a fool. You intimidate me.\"\n\nShe was delighted. \"I? Impossible.\"\n\nHe seated himself beside her. She exclaimed: \"Ah! a stag!\" The train\nwas passing through the forest of Saint-Germain and she had seen a\nfrightened deer clear an alley at a bound. As she gazed out of the open\nwindow, Duroy bending over her, pressed a kiss upon her neck. For\nseveral moments she remained motionless, then raising her head, she\nsaid: \"You tickle me, stop!\"\n\nBut he did not obey her.\n\nShe repeated: \"Stop, I say!\"\n\nHe seized her head with his right hand, turned it toward him and\npressed his lips to hers. She struggled, pushed him away and repeated:\n\"Stop!\"\n\nHe did not heed her. With an effort, she freed herself and rising,\nsaid: \"Georges, have done. We are not children, we shall soon reach\nRouen.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said he, gaily, \"I will wait.\"\n\nReseating herself near him she talked of what they would do on their\nreturn; they would keep the apartments in which she had lived with her\nfirst husband, and Duroy would receive Forestier's position on \"La Vie\nFrancaise.\" In the meantime, forgetting her injunctions and his\npromise, he slipped his arm around her waist, pressed her to him and\nmurmured: \"I love you dearly, my little Made.\"\n\nThe gentleness of his tone moved the young woman, and leaning toward\nhim she offered him her lips; as she did so, a whistle announced the\nproximity of the station. Pushing back some stray locks upon her\ntemples, she exclaimed:\n\n\"We are foolish.\"\n\nHe kissed her hands feverishly and replied:\n\n\"I adore you, my little Made.\"\n\nOn reaching Rouen they repaired to a hotel where they spent the night.\nThe following morning, when they had drunk the tea placed upon the\ntable in their room, Duroy clasped his wife in his arms and said: \"My\nlittle Made, I feel that I love you very, very much.\"\n\nShe smiled trustfully and murmured as she returned his kisses: \"I love\nyou too--a little.\"\n\nThe visit to his parents worried Georges, although he had prepared his\nwife. He began again: \"You know they are peasants, real, not sham,\ncomic-opera peasants.\"\n\nShe smiled. \"I know it, you have told me often enough.\"\n\n\"We shall be very uncomfortable. There is only a straw bed in my room;\nthey do not know what hair mattresses are at Canteleu.\"\n\nShe seemed delighted. \"So much the better. It would be charming to\nsleep badly--when--near you--and to be awakened by the crowing of the\ncocks.\"\n\nHe walked toward the window and lighted a cigarette. The sight of the\nharbor, of the river filled with ships moved him and he exclaimed:\n\"Egad, but that is fine!\"\n\nMadeleine joined him and placing both of her hands on her husband's\nshoulder, cried: \"Oh, how beautiful! I did not know that there were so\nmany ships!\"\n\nAn hour later they departed in order to breakfast with the old couple,\nwho had been informed several days before of their intended arrival.\nBoth Duroy and his wife were charmed with the beauties of the landscape\npresented to their view, and the cabman halted in order to allow them\nto get a better idea of the panorama before them. As he whipped up his\nhorse, Duroy saw an old couple not a hundred meters off, approaching,\nand he leaped from the carriage crying: \"Here they are, I know them.\"\n\nThe man was short, corpulent, florid, and vigorous, notwithstanding his\nage; the woman was tall, thin, and melancholy, with stooping\nshoulders--a woman who had worked from childhood, who had never laughed\nnor jested.\n\nMadeleine, too, alighted and watched the couple advance, with a\ncontraction of her heart she had not anticipated. They did not\nrecognize their son in that fine gentleman, and they would never have\ntaken that handsome lady for their daughter-in-law. They walked along,\npassed the child they were expecting, without glancing at the \"city\nfolks.\"\n\nGeorges cried with a laugh: \"Good day, Father Duroy.\"\n\nBoth the old man and his wife were struck dumb with astonishment; the\nlatter recovered her self-possession first and asked: \"Is it you, son?\"\n\nThe young man replied: \"Yes, it is I, Mother Duroy,\" and approaching\nher, he kissed her upon both cheeks and said: \"This is my wife.\"\n\nThe two rustics stared at Madeleine as if she were a curiosity, with\nanxious fear, combined with a sort of satisfied approbation on the part\nof the father and of jealous enmity on that of the mother.\n\nM. Duroy, senior, who was naturally jocose, made so bold as to ask with\na twinkle in his eye: \"May I kiss you too?\" His son uttered an\nexclamation and Madeleine offered her cheek to the old peasant; who\nafterward wiped his lips with the back of his hand. The old woman, in\nher turn, kissed her daughter-in-law with hostile reserve. Her ideal\nwas a stout, rosy, country lass, as red as an apple and as round.\n\nThe carriage preceded them with the luggage. The old man took his son's\narm and asked him: \"How are you getting on?\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"That is right. Tell me, has your wife any means?\"\n\nGeorges replied: \"Forty thousand francs.\"\n\nHis father whistled softly and muttered: \"Whew!\" Then he added: \"She is\na handsome woman.\" He admired his son's wife, and in his day had\nconsidered himself a connoisseur.\n\nMadeleine and the mother walked side by side in silence; the two men\njoined them. They soon reached the village, at the entrance to which\nstood M. Duroy's tavern. A pine board fastened over the door indicated\nthat thirsty people might enter. The table was laid. A neighbor, who\nhad come to assist, made a low courtesy on seeing so beautiful a lady\nappear; then recognizing Georges, she cried: \"Oh Lord, is it you?\"\n\nHe replied merrily: \"Yes, it is I, Mother Brulin,\" and he kissed her as\nhe had kissed his father and mother. Then he turned to his wife:\n\n\"Come into our room,\" said he, \"you can lay aside your hat.\"\n\nThey passed through a door to the right and entered a room paved with\nbrick, with whitewashed walls and a bed with cotton hangings.\n\nA crucifix above a holy-water basin and two colored prints,\nrepresenting Paul and Virginia beneath a blue palm-tree, and Napoleon\nI. on a yellow horse, were the only ornaments in that neat, but bare\nroom.\n\nWhen they were alone, Georges embraced Madeleine.\n\n\"Good morning, Made! I am glad to see the old people once more. When\none is in Paris one does not think of this place, but when one returns,\none enjoys it just the same.\"\n\nAt that moment his father cried, knocking on the partition with his\nfist: \"Come, the soup is ready.\"\n\nThey re-entered the large public-room and took their seats at the\ntable. The meal was a long one, served in a truly rustic fashion.\nFather Duroy, enlivened by the cider and several glasses of wine,\nrelated many anecdotes, while Georges, to whom they were all familiar,\nlaughed at them.\n\nMother Duroy did not speak, but sat at the board, grim and austere,\nglancing at her daughter-in-law with hatred in her heart.\n\nMadeleine did not speak nor did she eat; she was depressed. Wherefore?\nShe had wished to come; she knew that she was coming to a simple home;\nshe had formed no poetical ideas of those peasants, but she had perhaps\nexpected to find them somewhat more polished, refined. She recalled her\nown mother, of whom she never spoke to anyone--a governess who had been\nbetrayed and who had died of grief and shame when Madeleine was twelve\nyears old. A stranger had had the little girl educated. Her father\nwithout doubt. Who was he? She did not know positively, but she had\nvague suspicions.\n\nThe meal was not yet over when customers entered, shook hands with M.\nDuroy, exclaimed on seeing his son, and seating themselves at the\nwooden tables began to drink, smoke, and play dominoes. The smoke from\nthe clay pipes and penny cigars filled the room.\n\nMadeleine choked and asked: \"Can we go out? I cannot remain here any\nlonger.\"\n\nOld Duroy grumbled at being disturbed. Madeleine rose and placed her\nchair at the door in order to wait until her father-in-law and his wife\nhad finished their coffee and wine.\n\nGeorges soon joined her.\n\n\"Would you like to stroll down to the Seine?\"\n\nJoyfully she cried: \"Yes.\"\n\nThey descended the hillside, hired a boat at Croisset, and spent the\nremainder of the afternoon beneath the willows in the soft, warm,\nspring air, and rocked gently by the rippling waves of the river. They\nreturned at nightfall. The evening repast by candle-light was more\npainful to Madeleine than that of the morning. Neither Father Duroy nor\nhis wife spoke. When the meal was over, Madeleine drew her husband\noutside in order not to have to remain in that room, the atmosphere of\nwhich was heavy with smoke and the fumes of liquor.\n\nWhen they were alone, he said: \"You are already weary.\"\n\nShe attempted to protest; he interrupted her:\n\n\"I have seen it. If you wish we will leave tomorrow.\"\n\nShe whispered: \"I should like to go.\"\n\nThey walked along and entered a narrow path among high trees, hedged in\non either side by impenetrable brushwood.\n\nShe asked: \"Where are we?\"\n\nHe replied: \"In the forest--one of the largest in France.\"\n\nMadeleine, on raising her head, could see the stars between the\nbranches and hear the rustling of the leaves. She felt strangely\nnervous. Why, she could not tell. She seemed to be lost, surrounded by\nperils, abandoned, alone, beneath that vast vaulted sky.\n\nShe murmured: \"I am afraid; I should like to return.\"\n\n\"Very well, we will.\"\n\nOn their return they found the old people in bed. The next morning\nMadeleine rose early and was ready to leave at daybreak. When Georges\ntold his parents that they were going to return home, they guessed\nwhose wish it was.\n\nHis father asked simply: \"Shall I see you soon again?\"\n\n\"Yes--in the summer-time.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\nHis mother grumbled: \"I hope you will not regret what you have done.\"\n\nGeorges gave them two hundred francs to appease them, and the cab\narriving at ten o'clock, the couple kissed the old peasants and set out.\n\nAs they were descending the side of the hill, Duroy laughed. \"You see,\"\nsaid he, \"I warned you. I should, however, not have presented you to M.\nand Mme. du Roy de Cantel, senior.\"\n\nShe laughed too and replied: \"I am charmed now! They are nice people\nwhom I am beginning to like very much. I shall send them confections\nfrom Paris.\" Then she murmured: \"Du Roy de Cantel. We will say that we\nspent a week at your parents' estate,\" and drawing near him, she kissed\nhim saying:\n\n\"Good morning, Georges.\"\n\nHe replied: \"Good morning, Madeleine,\" as he slipped his arm around her\nwaist.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nJEALOUSY\n\n\nThe Du Roys had been in Paris two days and the journalist had resumed\nwork; he had given up his own especial province to assume that of\nForestier, and to devote himself entirely to politics. On this\nparticular evening he turned his steps toward home with a light heart.\nAs he passed a florist's on Rue Notre Dame de Lorette he bought a\nbouquet of half-open roses for Madeleine. Having forgotten his key, on\narriving at his door, he rang and the servant answered his summons.\n\nGeorges asked: \"Is Madame at home?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nIn the dining-room he paused in astonishment to see covers laid for\nthree: the door of the salon being ajar, he saw Madeleine arranging in\na vase on the mantelpiece a bunch of roses similar to his.\n\nHe entered the room and asked: \"Have you invited anyone to dinner?\"\n\nShe replied without turning her head and continuing the arrangement of\nher flowers: \"Yes and no: it is my old friend, Count de Vaudrec, who is\nin the habit of dining here every Monday and who will come now as he\nalways has.\"\n\nGeorges murmured: \"Very well.\"\n\nHe stopped behind her, the bouquet in his hand, the desire strong\nwithin him to conceal it--to throw it away. However, he said:\n\n\"Here, I have brought you some roses!\"\n\nShe turned to him with a smile and said: \"Ah, how thoughtful of you!\"\nand she kissed him with such evident affection that he felt consoled.\n\nShe took the flowers, inhaled their perfume, and put them in an empty\nvase. Then she said as she noted the effect: \"Now I am satisfied; my\nmantelpiece looks pretty,\" adding with an air of conviction:\n\n\"Vaudrec is charming; you will become intimate with him at once,\"\n\nA ring announced the Count. He entered as if he were at home. After\ngallantly kissing Mme. Du Roy's hand, he turned to her husband and\ncordially offered his hand, saying: \"How are you, my dear Du Roy?\"\n\nHe had no longer that haughty air, but was very affable. One would have\nthought in the course of five minutes, that the two men had known one\nanother for ten years. Madeleine, whose face was radiant, said: \"I will\nleave you together. I have work to superintend in the kitchen.\" The\ndinner was excellent and the Count remained very late. When he was\ngone, Madeleine said to her husband: \"Is he not nice? He improves, too,\non acquaintance. He is a good, true, faithful friend. Ah, without him--\"\n\nShe did not complete her sentence and Georges replied: \"Yes, he is very\npleasant, I think we shall understand each other well.\"\n\n\"You do not know,\" she said, \"that we have work to do to-night before\nretiring. I did not have time to tell you before dinner, for Vaudrec\ncame. Laroche-Mathieu brought me important news of Morocco. We must\nmake a fine article of that. Let us set to work at once. Come, take the\nlamp.\"\n\nHe carried the lamp and they entered the study. Madeleine leaned,\nagainst the mantelpiece, and having lighted a cigarette, told him the\nnews and gave him her plan of the article. He listened attentively,\nmaking notes as she spoke, and when she had finished he raised\nobjections, took up the question and, in his turn, developed another\nplan. His wife ceased smoking, for her interest was aroused in\nfollowing Georges's line of thought. From time to time she murmured:\n\"Yes, yes; very good--excellent--very forcible--\" And when he had\nfinished speaking, she said: \"Now let us write.\"\n\nIt was always difficult for him to make a beginning and she would lean\nover his shoulder and whisper the phrases in his ear, then he would add\na few lines; when their article was completed, Georges re-read it. Both\nhe and Madeleine pronounced it admirable and kissed one another with\npassionate admiration.\n\nThe article appeared with the signature of \"G. du Roy de Cantel,\" and\nmade a great sensation. M. Walter congratulated the author, who soon\nbecame celebrated in political circles. His wife, too, surprised him by\nthe ingenuousness of her mind, the cleverness of her wit, and the\nnumber of her acquaintances. At almost any time upon returning home he\nfound in his salon a senator, a deputy, a magistrate, or a general, who\ntreated Madeleine with grave familiarity.\n\nDeputy Laroche-Mathieu, who dined at Rue Fontaine every Tuesday, was\none of the largest stockholders of M. Walter's paper and the latter's\ncolleague and associate in many business transactions. Du Roy hoped,\nlater on, that some of the benefits promised by him to Forestier might\nfall to his share. They would be given to Madeleine's new husband--that\nwas all--nothing was changed; even his associates sometimes called him\nForestier, and it made Du Roy furious at the dead. He grew to hate the\nvery name; it was to him almost an insult. Even at home the obsession\ncontinued; the entire house reminded him of Charles.\n\nOne evening Du Roy, who liked sweetmeats, asked:\n\n\"Why do we never have sweets?\"\n\nHis wife replied pleasantly: \"I never think of it, because Charles\ndisliked them.\"\n\nHe interrupted her with an impatient gesture: \"Do you know I am getting\ntired of Charles? It is Charles here, Charles there, Charles liked\nthis, Charles liked that. Since Charles is dead, let him rest in peace.\"\n\nMadeleine ascribed her husband's burst of ill humor to puerile\njealousy, but she was flattered and did not reply. On retiring, haunted\nby the same thought, he asked:\n\n\"Did Charles wear a cotton nightcap to keep the draft out of his ears?\"\n\nShe replied pleasantly: \"No, a lace one!\"\n\nGeorges shrugged his shoulders and said scornfully: \"What a bird!\"\n\nFrom that time Georges never called Charles anything but \"poor\nCharles,\" with an accent of infinite pity. One evening as Du Roy was\nsmoking a cigarette at his window, toward the end of June, the heat\nawoke in him a desire for fresh air. He asked:\n\n\"My little Made, would you like to go as far as the Bois?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\n\nThey took an open carriage and drove to the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne.\nIt was a sultry evening; a host of cabs lined the drive, one behind\nanother. When the carriage containing Georges and Madeleine reached the\nturning which led to the fortifications, they kissed one another and\nMadeleine stammered in confusion: \"We are as childish as we were at\nRouen.\"\n\nThe road they followed was not so much frequented, a gentle breeze\nrustled the leaves of the trees, the sky was studded with brilliant\nstars and Georges murmured, as he pressed his wife to his breast: \"Oh,\nmy little Made.\"\n\nShe said to him: \"Do you remember how gloomy the forest at Canteleu\nwas? It seemed to me that it was full of horrible beasts and that it\nwas interminable, while here it is charming. One can feel the caressing\nbreezes, and I know that Sevres is on the other side.\"\n\nHe replied: \"In our forests there are nothing but stags, foxes,\nroebucks, and boars, with here and there a forester's house.\" He paused\nfor a moment and then asked: \"Did you come here in the evening with\nCharles occasionally?\"\n\nShe replied: \"Frequently.\"\n\nHe felt a desire to return home at once. Forestier's image haunted him,\nhowever; he could think of nothing else. The carriage rolled on toward\nthe Arc de Triomphe and joined the stream of carriages returning home.\nAs Georges remained silent, his wife, who divined his thoughts, asked\nin her soft voice: \"Of what are you thinking? For half an hour you have\nnot uttered a word.\"\n\nHe replied with a sneer: \"I am thinking of all those fools who kiss one\nanother, and I believe truly that there is something else to be done in\nlife.\"\n\nShe whispered: \"Yes, but it is nice sometimes! It is nice when one has\nnothing better to do.\"\n\nGeorges' thoughts were busy with the dead; he said to himself angrily:\n\"I am foolish to worry, to torment myself as I have done.\" After\nremonstrating thus with himself, he felt more reconciled to the thought\nof Forestier, and felt like exclaiming: \"Good evening, old fellow!\"\n\nMadeleine, who was bored by his silence, asked: \"Shall we go to\nTortoni's for ices before returning home?\"\n\nHe glanced at her from his corner and thought: \"She is pretty; so much\nthe better. Tit for tat, my comrade. But if they begin again to annoy\nme with you, it will get somewhat hot at the North Pole!\"\n\nThen he replied: \"Certainly, my darling,\" and before she had time to\nthink he kissed her. It seemed to Madeleine that her husband's lips\nwere icy. However he smiled as usual and gave her his hand to assist\nher to alight at the cafe.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nMADAME WALTER TAKES A HAND\n\n\nOn entering the office the following day, Du Roy sought Boisrenard and\ntold him to warn his associates not to continue the farce of calling\nhim Forestier, or there would be war. When Du Roy returned an hour\nlater, no one called him by that name. From the office he proceeded to\nhis home, and hearing the sound of ladies' voices in the drawing-room,\nhe asked the servant: \"Who is here?\"\n\n\"Mme. Walter and Mme. de Marelle,\" was the reply.\n\nHis heart pulsated violently as he opened the door. Clotilde was seated\nby the fireplace; it seemed to Georges that she turned pale on\nperceiving him.\n\nHaving greeted Mme. Walter and her two daughters seated like sentinels\nbeside her, he turned to his former mistress. She extended her hand; he\ntook and pressed it as if to say: \"I love you still!\" She returned the\npressure.\n\nHe said: \"Have you been well since we last met?\"\n\n\"Yes; have you, Bel-Ami?\" And turning to Madeleine she added: \"Will you\npermit me to call him Bel-Ami?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my dear; I will permit anything you wish.\"\n\nA shade of irony lurked beneath those words, uttered so pleasantly.\n\nMme. Walter mentioned a fencing-match to be given at Jacques Rival's\napartments, the proceeds to be devoted to charities, and in which many\nsociety ladies were going to assist. She said: \"It will be very\nentertaining; but I am in despair, for we have no one to escort us, my\nhusband having an engagement.\"\n\nDu Roy offered his services at once. She accepted, saying: \"My\ndaughters and I shall be very grateful.\"\n\nHe glanced at the younger of the two girls and thought: \"Little Suzanne\nis not at all bad, not at all.\"\n\nShe resembled a doll, being very small and dainty, with a\nwell-proportioned form, a pretty, delicate face, blue-gray eyes, a fair\nskin, and curly, flaxen hair. Her elder sister, Rose, was plain--one of\nthose girls to whom no attention is ever paid. Her mother rose, and\nturning to Georges, said: \"I shall count on you next Thursday at two\no'clock.\"\n\nHe replied: \"Count upon me, Madame.\"\n\nWhen the door closed upon Mme. Walter, Mme. de Marelle, in her turn,\nrose.\n\n\"Au revoir, Bel-Ami.\"\n\nThis time she pressed his hand and he was moved by that silent avowal.\n\"I will go to see her to-morrow,\" thought he.\n\nLeft alone with his wife, she laughed, and looking into his eyes said:\n\"Mme. Walter has taken a fancy to you!\"\n\nHe replied incredulously: \"Nonsense!\"\n\n\"But I know it. She spoke of you to me with great enthusiasm. She said\nshe would like to find two husbands like you for her daughters.\nFortunately she is not susceptible herself.\"\n\nHe did not understand her and repeated: \"Susceptible herself?\"\n\nShe replied in a tone of conviction: \"Oh, Mme. Walter is\nirreproachable. Her husband you know as well as I. But she is\ndifferent. Still she has suffered a great deal in having married a Jew,\nthough she has been true to him; she is a virtuous woman.\"\n\nDu Roy was surprised: \"I thought her a Jewess.\"\n\n\"She a Jewess! No, indeed! She is the prime mover in all the charitable\nmovements at the Madeleine. She was even married by a priest. I am not\nsure but that M. Walter went through the form of baptism.\"\n\nGeorges murmured: \"And--she--likes--me--\"\n\n\"Yes. If you were not married I should advise you to ask for the hand\nof--Suzanne--would you not prefer her to Rose?\"\n\nHe replied as he twisted his mustache: \"Eh! the mother is not so bad!\"\n\nMadeleine replied: \"I am not afraid of her. At her age one does not\nbegin to make conquests--one should commence sooner.\"\n\nGeorges thought: \"If I might have had Suzanne, ah!\" Then he shrugged\nhis shoulders: \"Bah, it is absurd; her father would not have consented.\"\n\nHe determined to treat Mme. Walter very considerately in order to\nretain her regard. All that evening he was haunted by recollections of\nhis love for Clotilde; he recalled their escapades, her kindness. He\nrepeated to himself: \"She is indeed nice. Yes, I shall call upon her\nto-morrow.\"\n\nWhen he had lunched the following morning he repaired to Rue Verneuil.\nThe same maid opened the door, and with the familiarity of an old\nservant she asked: \"Is Monsieur well?\"\n\nHe replied: \"Yes, my child,\" and entered the drawing-room in which some\none was practising scales. It was Laurine. He expected she would fall\nupon his neck. She, however, rose ceremoniously, bowed coldly, and left\nthe room with dignity; her manner was so much like that of an outraged\nwoman that he was amazed. Her mother entered. He kissed her hand.\n\n\"How much I have thought of you,\" said he.\n\n\"And I of you,\" she replied.\n\nThey seated themselves and smiled as they gazed into one another's eyes.\n\n\"My dear little Clo, I love you.\"\n\n\"And I love you.\"\n\n\"Still--still--you did not miss me.\"\n\n\"Yes and no. I was grieved, but when I heard your reason, I said to\nmyself: 'Bah, he will return to me some day.'\"\n\n\"I dared not come. I did not know how I should be received. I dared\nnot, but I longed to come. Now, tell me what ails Laurine; she scarcely\nbade me good morning and left the room with an angry air.\"\n\n\"I do not know, but one cannot mention you to her since your marriage;\nI really believe she is jealous.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear, she no longer calls you Bel-Ami, but M. Forestier\ninstead.\"\n\nDu Roy colored, then drawing nearer the young woman, he said: \"Kiss me.\"\n\nShe obeyed him.\n\n\"Where can we meet again?\" he asked.\n\n\"At Rue de Constantinople.\"\n\n\"Ah, are the apartments not rented?\"\n\n\"No, I kept them.\"\n\n\"You did?\"\n\n\"Yes, I thought you would return.\"\n\nHis heart bounded joyfully. She loved him then with a lasting love! He\nwhispered: \"I adore you.\" Then he asked: \"Is your husband well?\"\n\n\"Yes, very well. He has just been home for a month; he went away the\nday before yesterday.\"\n\nDu Roy could not suppress a smile: \"How opportunely that always\nhappens!\"\n\nShe replied naively: \"Yes, it happens opportunely, but he is not in the\nway when he is here; is he?\"\n\n\"That is true; he is a charming man!\"\n\n\"How do you like your new life?\"\n\n\"Tolerably; my wife is a comrade, an associate, nothing more; as for my\nheart--\"\n\n\"I understand; but she is good.\"\n\n\"Yes, she does not trouble me.\"\n\nHe drew near Clotilde and murmured: \"When shall we meet again?\"\n\n\"To-morrow, if you will.\"\n\n\"Yes, to-morrow at two o'clock.\"\n\nHe rose to take his leave somewhat embarrassed.\n\n\"You know I intend to take back the rooms on Rue de Constantinople\nmyself. I wish to; it is not necessary for you to pay for them.\"\n\nShe kissed his hands, saying: \"You may do as you like. I am satisfied\nto have kept them until we met again.\" And Du Roy took his leave very\nwell satisfied.\n\nWhen Thursday came, he asked Madeleine: \"Are going to the fencing-match\nat Rival's?\"\n\n\"No, I do not care about it. I will go to the chamber of deputies.\"\n\nGeorges called for Mme. Walter in an open carriage, for the weather was\ndelightful. He was surprised to find her looking so handsome and so\nyoung. Never had she appeared so fresh. Her daughter, Suzanne, was\ndressed in pink; her sister looked like her governess. At Rival's door\nwas a long line of carriages. Du Roy offered his arm to Mme. Walter and\nthey entered.\n\nThe entertainment was for the benefit of the orphans of the Sixth Ward\nunder the patronage of all the wiles of the senators and deputies who\nwere connected with \"La Vie Francaise.\"\n\nJacques Rival received the arrivals at the entrance to his apartments,\nthen he pointed to a small staircase which led to the cellar in which\nwere his shooting-gallery and fencing-room, saying: \"Downstairs,\nladies, downstairs. The match will take place in the subterranean\napartments.\"\n\nPressing Du Roy's hand, he said: \"Good evening, Bel-Ami.\"\n\nDu Roy was surprised: \"Who told you about that name?\"\n\nRival replied: \"Mme. Walter, who thinks it very pretty.\"\n\nMme. Walter blushed.\n\n\"Yes, I confess that if I knew you better, I should do as little\nLaurine, and I should call you Bel-Ami, too. It suits you admirably.\"\n\nDu Roy laughed. \"I beg you to do so, Madame.\"\n\nShe cast down her eyes. \"No, we are not well enough acquainted.\"\n\nHe murmured: \"Permit me to hope that we shall become so.\"\n\n\"Well, we shall see,\" said she.\n\nThey descended the stairs and entered a large room, which was lighted\nby Venetian lanterns and decorated with festoons of gauze. Nearly all\nthe benches were filled with ladies, who were chatting as if they were\nat a theater. Mme. Walter and her daughters reached their seats in the\nfront row.\n\nDu Roy, having obtained their places for them, whispered: \"I shall be\nobliged to leave you; men cannot occupy the seats.\"\n\nMme. Walter replied hesitatingly: \"I should like to keep you, just the\nsame. You could tell me the names of the participants. See, if you\nstand at the end of the seat, you will not annoy anyone.\" She raised\nher large, soft eyes to his and insisted: \"Come, stay with\nus--Bel-Ami--we need you!\"\n\nHe replied: \"I obey with pleasure, Madame!\"\n\nSuddenly Jacques Rival's voice announced: \"We will begin, ladies.\"\n\nThen followed the fencing-match. Du Roy retained his place beside the\nladies and gave them all the necessary information. When the\nentertainment was over and all expenses were paid, two hundred and\ntwenty francs remained for the orphans of the Sixth Ward.\n\nDu Roy, escorting the Walters, awaited his carriage. When seated face\nto face with Mme. Walter, he met her troubled but caressing glance.\n\n\"Egad, I believe she is affected,\" thought he; and he smiled as he\nrecognized the fact that he was really successful with the female sex,\nfor Mme. de Marelle, since the renewal of their relations, seemed to\nlove him madly.\n\nWith a light heart he returned home. Madeleine was awaiting him in the\ndrawing-room.\n\n\"I have some news,\" said she. \"The affair with Morocco is becoming\ncomplicated. France may send an expedition out there in several months.\nIn any case the ministry will be overthrown and Laroche will profit by\nthe occasion.\"\n\nDu Roy, in order to draw out his wife, pretended not to believe it.\n\"France would not be silly enough to commence any folly with Tunis!\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders impatiently. \"I tell you she will! You do\nnot understand that it is a question of money--you are as simple as\nForestier.\"\n\nHer object was to wound and irritate him, but he only smiled and\nreplied: \"What! as simple as that stupid fellow?\"\n\nShe ceased and murmured: \"Oh, Georges!\"\n\nHe added: \"Poor devil!\" in a tone of profound pity.\n\nMadeleine turned her back upon him scornfully; after a moment of\nsilence, she continued: \"We shall have some company Tuesday. Mme.\nLaroche-Mathieu is coming here to dine with Viscountess de Percemur.\nWill you invite Rival and Norbert de Varenne? I shall go to Mmes.\nWalter and de Marelle to-morrow. Perhaps, too, we may have Mme.\nRissolin.\"\n\nDu Roy replied: \"Very well, I will see to Rival and Norbert.\"\n\nThe following day he thought he would anticipate his wife's visit to\nMme. Walter and attempt to find out if she really was in love with him.\nHe arrived at Boulevard Malesherbes at two o'clock. He was ushered into\nthe salon and waited. Finally Mme. Walter appeared and offered him her\nhand cordially. \"What good wind blows you here?\"\n\n\"No good wind, but a desire to see you. Some power has impelled me\nhither, I do not know why; I have nothing to say except that I have\ncome; here I am! Pardon the morning call and the candor of my\nexplanation.\"\n\nHe uttered those words with a smile upon his lips and a serious accent\nin his voice.\n\nIn her astonishment, she stammered with a blush: \"But indeed--I do not\nunderstand--you surprise me.\"\n\nHe added: \"It is a declaration made in jest in order not to startle\nyou.\"\n\nThey were seated near each other. She took the matter as a jest. \"Is it\na declaration--seriously?\"\n\n\"Yes, for a long time I have wished to make it, but I dared not; they\nsay you are so austere, so rigid.\"\n\nShe had recovered her self-possession and replied:\n\n\"Why did you choose to-day?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\" Then he lowered his voice: \"Or rather because I have\nthought only of you since yesterday.\"\n\nSuddenly turning pale, she gasped: \"Come, enough of this childishness!\nLet us talk of something else.\"\n\nBut he fell upon his knees before her. She tried to rise; he prevented\nher by twining his arms about her waist, and repeated in a passionate\nvoice: \"Yes, it is true that I have loved you madly for some time. Do\nnot answer me. I am mad--I love you. Oh, if you knew how I love you!\"\n\nShe could utter no sound; in her agitation she repulsed him with both\nhands, for she could feel his breath upon her cheek. He rose suddenly\nand attempted to embrace her, but gaining her liberty for a moment, she\nescaped him and ran from chair to chair. He, considering such pursuit\nbeneath his dignity, sank into a chair, buried his face in his hands,\nand feigned to sob convulsively. Then he rose, cried:\n\n\"Adieu, adieu!\" and fled.\n\nIn the hall he took his cane calmly and left the house saying: \"Cristi!\nI believe she loves me!\"\n\nHe went at once to the telegraph office to send a message to Clotilde,\nappointing a rendezvous for the next day.\n\nOn entering the house at his usual time, he said to his wife: \"Well, is\neveryone coming to dinner?\"\n\nShe replied: \"Yes, all but Mme. Walter, who is uncertain as to whether\nshe can come. She acted very strangely. Never mind, perhaps she can\nmanage it anyway.\"\n\nHe replied: \"She will come.\"\n\nHe was not, however, certain and was rendered uneasy until the day of\nthe dinner. That morning Madeleine received a message from Mme. Walter\nto this effect: \"I have succeeded in arranging matters and I shall be\nwith you, but my husband cannot accompany me.\"\n\nDu Roy thought: \"I did right not to return there. She has calmed down.\"\nStill he awaited her arrival anxiously.\n\nShe appeared very composed, somewhat reserved, and haughty. He was very\nhumble, very careful, and submissive. Mmes. Laroche-Mathieu and\nRissolin were accompanied by their husbands. Mme. de Marelle looked\nbewitching in an odd combination of yellow and black.\n\nAt Du Roy's right sat Mme. Walter, and he spoke to her only of serious\nmatters with exaggerated respect. From time to time he glanced at\nClotilde.\n\n\"She is really very pretty and fresh looking,\" thought he. But Mme.\nWalter attracted him by the difficulty of the conquest. She took her\nleave early.\n\n\"I will escort you,\" said he.\n\nShe declined his offer. He insisted: \"Why do you not want me? You wound\nme deeply. Do not let me feel that I am not forgiven. You see that I am\ncalm.\"\n\nShe replied: \"You cannot leave your guests thus.\"\n\nHe smiled: \"Bah! I shall be absent twenty minutes. No one will even\nnotice it; if you refuse me, you will break my heart.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" she whispered, \"I will accept.\"\n\nWhen they were seated in the carriage, he seized her hand, and kissing\nit passionately said: \"I love you, I love you. Let me tell it to you. I\nwill not touch you. I only wish to repeat that I love you.\"\n\nShe stammered: \"After what you promised me--it is too bad--too bad.\"\n\nHe seemed to make a great effort, then he continued in a subdued voice:\n\"See, how I can control myself--and yet--let me only tell you this--I\nlove you--yes, let me go home with you and kneel before you five\nminutes to utter those three words and gaze upon your beloved face.\"\n\nShe suffered him to take her hand and replied in broken accents: \"No, I\ncannot--I do not wish to. Think of what my servants, my daughters,\nwould say--no--no--it is impossible.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I cannot live without seeing you; whether it be at your\nhouse or elsewhere, I must see you for only a moment each day that I\nmay touch your hand, breathe the air stirred by your gown, contemplate\nthe outlines of your form, and see your beautiful eyes.\"\n\nShe listened tremblingly to the musical language of love, and made\nanswer: \"No, it is impossible. Be silent!\"\n\nHe spoke very low; he whispered in her ear, comprehending that it was\nnecessary to win that simple woman gradually, to persuade her to\nappoint a meeting where she willed at first, and later on where he\nwilled.\n\n\"Listen: I must see you! I will wait at your door like a beggar. If you\ndo not come down, I will come to you, but I shall see you to-morrow.\"\n\nShe repeated: \"No, do not come. I shall not receive you. Think of my\ndaughters!\"\n\n\"Then tell me where I can meet you--in the street--it matters not\nwhere--at any hour you wish--provided that I can see you. I will greet\nyou; I will say, I love you; and then go away.\"\n\nShe hesitated, almost distracted. As the coupe stopped at the door, she\nwhispered hastily: \"I will be at La Trinite to-morrow, at half past\nthree.\"\n\nAfter alighting, she said to her coachman: \"Take M. du Roy home.\"\n\nWhen he returned, his wife asked: \"Where have you been?\"\n\nHe replied in a low voice: \"I have been to send an important telegram.\"\n\nMme. de Marelle approached him: \"You must take me home, Bel-Ami; you\nknow that I only dine so far from home on that condition.\" Turning to\nMadeleine, she asked: \"You are not jealous?\"\n\nMme. du Roy replied slowly: \"No, not at all.\"\n\nThe guests departed. Clotilde, enveloped in laces, whispered to\nMadeleine at the door: \"Your dinner was perfect. In a short while you\nwill have the best political salon in Paris.\"\n\nWhen she was alone with Georges, she said: \"Oh, my darling Bel-Ami, I\nlove you more dearly every day.\"\n\nThe cab rolled on, and Georges' thoughts were with Mme. Walter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nA MEETING AND THE RESULT\n\n\nThe July sun shone upon the Place de la Trinite, which was almost\ndeserted. Du Roy drew out his watch. It was only three o'clock: he was\nhalf an hour too early. He laughed as he thought of the place of\nmeeting. He entered the sacred edifice of La Trinite; the coolness\nwithin was refreshing. Here and there an old woman kneeled at prayer,\nher face in her hands. Du Roy looked at his watch again. It was not yet\na quarter past three. He took a seat, regretting that he could not\nsmoke. At the end of the church near the choir; he could hear the\nmeasured tread of a corpulent man whom he had noticed when he entered.\nSuddenly the rustle of a gown made him start. It was she. He arose and\nadvanced quickly. She did not offer him her hand and whispered: \"I have\nonly a few minutes. You must kneel near me that no one will notice us.\"\n\nShe proceeded to a side aisle after saluting the Host on the High\nAltar, took a footstool, and kneeled down. Georges took one beside it\nand when they were in the attitude of prayer, he said: \"Thank you,\nthank you. I adore you. I should like to tell you constantly how I\nbegan to love you, how I was conquered the first time I saw you. Will\nyou permit me some day to unburden my heart, to explain all to you?\"\n\nShe replied between her fingers: \"I am mad to let you speak to me\nthus--mad to have come hither--mad to do as I have done, to let you\nbelieve that this--this adventure can have any results. Forget it, and\nnever speak to me of it again.\" She paused.\n\nHe replied: \"I expect nothing--I hope nothing--I love you--whatever you\nmay do, I will repeat it so often, with so much force and ardor that\nyou will finally understand me, and reply: 'I love you too.'\"\n\nHe felt her frame tremble as she involuntarily repeated: \"I love you\ntoo.\"\n\nHe was overcome by astonishment.\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" she continued incoherently, \"Should I say that to you? I\nfeel guilty, despicable--I--who have two daughters--but I\ncannot--cannot--I never thought--it was stronger than\nI--listen--listen--I have never loved--any other--but you--I swear\nit--I have loved you a year in secret--I have suffered and struggled--I\ncan no longer; I love you.\" She wept and her bowed form was shaken by\nthe violence of her emotion.\n\nGeorges murmured: \"Give me your hand that I may touch, may press it.\"\n\nShe slowly took her hand from her face, he seized it saying: \"I should\nlike to drink your tears!\"\n\nPlacing the hand he held upon his heart he asked: \"Do you feel it beat?\"\n\nIn a few moments the man Georges had noticed before passed by them.\nWhen Mme. Walter heard him near her, she snatched her fingers from\nGeorges's clasp and covered her face with them. After the man had\ndisappeared, Du Roy asked, hoping for another place of meeting than La\nTrinite: \"Where shall I see you to-morrow?\"\n\nShe did not reply; she seemed transformed into a statue of prayer. He\ncontinued: \"Shall I meet you to-morrow at Park Monceau?\"\n\nShe turned a livid face toward him and said unsteadily: \"Leave\nme--leave me now--go--go away--for only five minutes--I suffer too much\nnear you. I want to pray--go. Let me pray alone--five minutes--let me\nask God--to pardon me--to save me--leave me--five minutes.\"\n\nShe looked so pitiful that he rose without a word and asked with some\nhesitation: \"Shall I return presently?\"\n\nShe nodded her head in the affirmative and he left her. She tried to\npray; she closed her eyes in order not to see Georges. She could not\npray; she could only think of him. She would rather have died than have\nfallen thus; she had never been weak. She murmured several words of\nsupplication; she knew that all was over, that the struggle was in\nvain. She did not however wish to yield, but she felt her weakness.\nSome one approached with a rapid step; she turned her head. It was a\npriest. She rose, ran toward him, and clasping her hands, she cried:\n\"Save me, save me!\"\n\nHe stopped in surprise.\n\n\"What do you want, Madame?\"\n\n\"I want you to save me. Have pity on me. If you do not help me, I am\nlost!\"\n\nHe gazed at her, wondering if she were mad.\n\n\"What can I do for you?\" The priest was a young man somewhat inclined\nto corpulence.\n\n\"Receive my confession,\" said she, \"and counsel me, sustain me, tell me\nwhat to do.\"\n\nHe replied: \"I confess every Saturday from three to six.\"\n\nSeizing his arm she repeated: \"No, now, at once--at once! It is\nnecessary! He is here! In this church! He is waiting for me.\"\n\nThe priest asked: \"Who is waiting for you?\"\n\n\"A man--who will be my ruin if you do not save me. I can no longer\nescape him--I am too weak--too weak.\"\n\nShe fell upon her knees sobbing: \"Oh, father, have pity upon me. Save\nme, for God's sake, save me!\" She seized his gown that he might not\nescape her, while he uneasily glanced around on all sides to see if\nanyone noticed the woman at his feet. Finally, seeing that he could not\nfree himself from her, he said: \"Rise; I have the key to the\nconfessional with me.\"\n\n      *       *       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDu Roy having walked around the choir, was sauntering down the nave,\nwhen he met the stout, bold man wandering about, and he wondered: \"What\ncan he be doing here?\"\n\nThe man slackened his pace and looked at Georges with the evident\ndesire to speak to him. When he was near him, he bowed and said\npolitely:\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir, for disturbing you; but can you tell me when\nthis church was built?\"\n\nDu Roy replied: \"I do not know; I think it is twenty or twenty-five\nyears. It is the first time I have been here. I have never seen it\nbefore.\" Feeling interested in the stranger, the journalist continued:\n\"It seems to me that you are examining into it very carefully.\"\n\nThe man replied: \"I am not visiting the church; I have an appointment.\"\nHe paused and in a few moments added: \"It is very warm outside.\"\n\nDu Roy looked at him and suddenly thought that he resembled Forestier.\n\"Are you from the provinces?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, I am from Rennes. And did you, sir, enter this church from\ncuriosity?\"\n\n\"No, I am waiting for a lady.\" And with a smile upon his lips, he\nwalked away.\n\nHe did not find Mme. Walter in the place in which he had left her, and\nwas surprised. She had gone. He was furious. Then he thought she might\nbe looking for him, and he walked around the church. Not finding her,\nhe returned and seated himself on the chair she had occupied, hoping\nthat she would rejoin him there. Soon he heard the sound of a voice. He\nsaw no one; whence came it? He rose to examine into it, and saw in a\nchapel near by, the doors of the confessionals. He drew nearer in order\nto see the woman whose voice he heard. He recognized Mme. Walter; she\nwas confessing. At first he felt a desire to seize her by the arm and\ndrag her away; then he seated himself near by and bided his time. He\nwaited quite awhile. At length Mme. Walter rose, turned, saw him and\ncame toward him. Her face was cold and severe.\n\n\"Sir,\" said she, \"I beseech you not to accompany me, not to follow me\nand not to come to my house alone. You will not be admitted. Adieu!\"\nAnd she walked away in a dignified manner.\n\nHe permitted her to go, because it was against his principles to force\nmatters. As the priest in his turn issued from the confessional, he\nadvanced toward him and said: \"If you did not wear a gown, I would give\nyou a sound thrashing.\" Then he turned upon his heel and left the\nchurch whistling. In the doorway he met the stout gentleman. When Du\nRoy passed him, they bowed.\n\nThe journalist then repaired to the office of \"La Vie Francaise.\" As he\nentered he saw by the clerks' busy air that something of importance was\ngoing on, and he hastened to the manager's room. The latter exclaimed\njoyfully as Du Roy entered: \"What luck! here is Bel-Ami.\"\n\nHe stopped in confusion and apologized: \"I beg your pardon, I am very\nmuch bothered by circumstances. And then I hear my wife and daughter\ncall you Bel-Ami from morning until night, and I have acquired the\nhabit myself. Are you displeased?\"\n\nGeorges laughed. \"Not at all.\"\n\nM. Walter continued: \"Very well, then I will call you Bel-Ami as\neveryone else does. Great changes have taken place. The ministry has\nbeen overthrown. Marrot is to form a new cabinet. He has chosen General\nBoutin d'Acre as minister of war, and our friend Laroche-Mathieu as\nminister of foreign affairs. We shall be very busy. I must write a\nleading article, a simple declaration of principles; then I must have\nsomething interesting on the Morocco question--you must attend to that.\"\n\nDu Roy reflected a moment and then replied: \"I have it. I will give you\nan article on the political situation of our African colony,\" and he\nproceeded to prepare M. Walter an outline of his work, which was\nnothing but a modification of his first article on \"Souvenirs of a\nSoldier in Africa.\"\n\nThe manager having read the article said: \"It is perfect; you are a\ntreasure. Many thanks.\"\n\nDu Roy returned home to dinner delighted with his day, notwithstanding\nhis failure at La Trinite. His wife was awaiting him anxiously. She\nexclaimed on seeing him:\n\n\"You know that Laroche is minister of foreign affairs.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have just written an article on that subject.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Do you remember the first article we wrote on 'Souvenirs of a Soldier\nin Africa'? Well, I revised and corrected it for the occasion.\"\n\nShe smiled. \"Ah, yes, that will do very well.\"\n\nAt that moment the servant entered with a dispatch containing these\nwords without any signature:\n\n\"I was beside myself. Pardon me and come to-morrow at four o'clock to\nPark Monceau.\"\n\nHe understood the message, and with a joyful heart, slipped the\ntelegram into his pocket. During dinner he repeated the words to\nhimself; as he interpreted them, they meant, \"I yield--I am yours where\nand when you will.\" He laughed.\n\nMadeleine asked: \"What is it?\"\n\n\"Nothing much. I was thinking of a comical old priest I met a short\nwhile since.\"\n\n      *       *       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDu Roy arrived at the appointed hour the following day. The benches\nwere all occupied by people trying to escape from the heat and by\nnurses with their charges.\n\nHe found Mme. Walter in a little antique ruin; she seemed unhappy and\nanxious. When he had greeted her, she said: \"How many people there are\nin the garden!\"\n\nHe took advantage of the occasion: \"Yes, that is true; shall we go\nsomewhere else?\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"It matters not where; for a drive, for instance. You can lower the\nshade on your side and you will be well concealed.\"\n\n\"Yes, I should like that better; I shall die of fear here.\"\n\n\"Very well, meet me in five minutes at the gate which opens on the\nboulevard. I will fetch a cab.\"\n\nWhen they were seated in the cab, she asked: \"Where did you tell the\ncoachman to drive to?\"\n\nGeorges replied: \"Do not worry; he knows.\"\n\nHe had given the man his address on the Rue de Constantinople.\n\nMme. Walter said to Du Roy: \"You cannot imagine how I suffer on your\naccount--how I am tormented, tortured. Yesterday I was harsh, but I\nwanted to escape you at any price. I was afraid to remain alone with\nyou. Have you forgiven me?\"\n\nHe pressed her hand. \"Yes, yes, why should I not forgive you, loving\nyou as I do?\"\n\nShe looked at him with a beseeching air: \"Listen: You must promise to\nrespect me, otherwise I could never see you again.\"\n\nAt first he did not reply; a smile lurked beneath his mustache; then he\nmurmured: \"I am your slave.\"\n\nShe told him how she had discovered that she loved him, on learning\nthat he was to marry Madeleine Forestier. Suddenly she ceased speaking.\nThe carriage stopped. Du Roy opened the door.\n\n\"Where are we?\" she asked.\n\nHe replied: \"Alight and enter the house. We shall be undisturbed there.\"\n\n\"Where are we?\" she repeated.\n\n\"At my rooms; they are my bachelor apartments which I have rented for a\nfew days that we might have a corner in which to meet.\"\n\nShe clung to the cab, startled at the thought of a tete-a-tete, and\nstammered: \"No, no, I do not want to.\"\n\nHe said firmly: \"I swear to respect you. Come, you see that people are\nlooking at us, that a crowd is gathering around us. Make haste!\" And he\nrepeated, \"I swear to respect you.\"\n\nShe was terror-stricken and rushed into the house. She was about to\nascend the stairs. He seized her arm: \"It is here, on the ground floor.\"\n\nWhen he had closed the door, he showered kisses upon her neck, her\neyes, her lips; in spite of herself, she submitted to his caresses and\neven returned them, hiding her face and murmuring in broken accents: \"I\nswear that I have never had a lover\"; while he thought: \"That is a\nmatter of indifference to me.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nMADAME DE MARELLE\n\n\nAutumn had come. The Du Roys had spent the entire summer in Paris,\nleading a vigorous campaign in \"La Vie Francaise,\" in favor of the new\ncabinet. Although it was only the early part of October, the chamber\nwas about to resume its sessions, for affairs in Morocco were becoming\nmenacing. The celebrated speech made by Count de Lambert Sarrazin had\nfurnished Du Roy with material for ten articles on the Algerian colony.\n\"La Vie Francaise\" had gained considerable prestige by its connection\nwith the power; it was the first to give political news, and every\nnewspaper in Paris and the provinces sought information from it. It was\nquoted, feared, and began to be respected: it was no longer the organ\nof a group of political intriguers, but the avowed mouthpiece of the\ncabinet. Laroche-Mathieu was the soul of the journal and Du Roy his\nspeaking-trumpet. M. Walter retired discreetly into the background.\nMadeleine's salon became an influential center in which several members\nof the cabinet met every week. The president of the council had even\ndined there twice; the minister of foreign affairs was quite at home at\nthe Du Roys; he came at any hour, bringing dispatches or information,\nwhich he dictated either to the husband or wife as if they were his\nsecretaries. After the minister had departed, when Du Roy was alone\nwith Madeleine, he uttered threats and insinuations against the\n\"parvenu,\" as he called him. His wife simply shrugged her shoulders\nscornfully, repeating: \"Become a minister and you can do the same;\nuntil then, be silent.\"\n\nHis reply was: \"No one knows of what I am capable; perhaps they will\nfind out some day.\"\n\nShe answered philosophically: \"He who lives will see.\"\n\nThe morning of the reopening of the Chamber, Du Roy lunched with\nLaroche-Mathieu in order to receive instructions from him, before the\nsession, for a political article the following day in \"La Vie\nFrancaise,\" which was to be a sort of official declaration of the plans\nof the cabinet. After listening to Laroche-Mathieu's eloquence for some\ntime with jealousy in his heart, Du Roy sauntered slowly toward the\noffice to commence his work, for he had nothing to do until four\no'clock, at which hour he was to meet Mme. de Marelle at Rue de\nConstantinople. They met there regularly twice a week, Mondays and\nWednesdays.\n\nOn entering the office, he was handed a sealed dispatch; it was from\nMme. Walter, and read thus:\n\n    \"It is absolutely necessary that I should see you to-day. It is\n     important. Expect me at two o'clock at Rue de Constantinople. I\n     can render you a great service; your friend until death,\"\n\n    \"VIRGINIE.\"\n\nHe exclaimed: \"Heavens! what a bore!\" and left the office at once, too\nmuch annoyed to work.\n\nFor six weeks he had ineffectually tried to break with Mme. Walter. At\nthree successive meetings she had been a prey to remorse, and had\noverwhelmed her lover with reproaches. Angered by those scenes and\nalready weary of the dramatic woman, he had simply avoided her, hoping\nthat the affair would end in that way.\n\nBut she persecuted him with her affection, summoned him at all times by\ntelegrams to meet her at street corners, in shops, or public gardens.\nShe was very different from what he had fancied she would be, trying to\nattract him by actions ridiculous in one of her age. It disgusted him\nto hear her call him: \"My rat--my dog--my treasure--my jewel--my\nblue-bird\"--and to see her assume a kind of childish modesty when he\napproached. It seemed to him that being the mother of a family, a woman\nof the world, she should have been more sedate, and have yielded With\ntears if she chose, but with the tears of a Dido and not of a Juliette.\nHe never heard her call him \"Little one\" or \"Baby,\" without wishing to\nreply \"Old woman,\" to take his hat with an oath and leave the room.\n\nAt first they had often met at Rue de Constantinople, but Du Roy, who\nfeared an encounter with Mme. de Marelle, invented a thousand and one\npretexts in order to avoid that rendezvous. He was therefore obliged to\neither lunch or dine at her house daily, when she would clasp his hand\nunder cover of the table or offer him her lips behind the doors. Above\nall, Georges enjoyed being thrown so much in contact with Suzanne; she\nmade sport of everything and everybody with cutting appropriateness. At\nlength, however, he began to feel an unconquerable repugnance to the\nlove lavished upon him by the mother; he could no longer see her, hear\nher, nor think of her without anger. He ceased calling upon her,\nreplying to her letters, and yielding to her appeals. She finally\ndivined that he no longer loved her, and the discovery caused her\nunutterable anguish; but she watched him, followed him in a cab with\ndrawn blinds to the office, to his house, in the hope of seeing him\npass by. He would have liked to strangle her, but he controlled himself\non account of his position on \"La Vie Francaise\" and he endeavored by\nmeans of coldness, and even at times harsh words, to make her\ncomprehend that all was at an end between them.\n\nThen, too, she persisted in devising ruses for summoning him to Rue de\nConstantinople, and he was in constant fear that the two women would\nsome day meet face to face at the door.\n\nOn the other hand, his affection for Mme. de Marelle had increased\nduring the summer. They were both Bohemians by nature; they took\nexcursions together to Argenteuil, Bougival, Maisons, and Poissy, and\nwhen he was forced to return and dine at Mme. Walter's, he detested his\nmature mistress more thoroughly, as he recalled the youthful one he had\njust left. He was congratulating himself upon having freed himself\nalmost entirely from the former's clutches, when he received the\ntelegram above mentioned.\n\nHe re-read it as he walked along. He thought: \"What does that old owl\nwant with me? I am certain she has nothing to tell me except that she\nadores me. However, I will see, perhaps there is some truth in it.\nClotilde is coming at four, I must get rid of the other one at three or\nsoon after, provided they do not meet. What jades women are!\"\n\nAs he uttered those words he was reminded of his wife, who was the only\none who did not torment him; she lived by his side and seemed to love\nhim very much at the proper time, for she never permitted anything to\ninterfere with her ordinary occupations of life. He strolled toward the\nappointed place of meeting, mentally cursing Mme. Walter.\n\n\"Ah, I will receive her in such a manner that she will not tell me\nanything. First of all, I will give her to understand that I shall\nnever cross her threshold again.\"\n\nHe entered to await her. She soon arrived and, seeing him, exclaimed:\n\"Ah, you received my dispatch! How fortunate!\"\n\n\"Yes, I received it at the office just as I was setting out for the\nChamber. What do you want?\" he asked ungraciously.\n\nShe had raised her veil in order to kiss him, and approached him\ntimidly and humbly with the air of a beaten dog.\n\n\"How unkind you are to me; how harshly you speak! What have I done to\nyou? You do not know what I have suffered for you!\"\n\nHe muttered: \"Are you going to begin that again?\"\n\nShe stood near him awaiting a smile, a word of encouragement, to cast\nherself into his arms, and whispered: \"You need not have won me to\ntreat me thus; you might have left me virtuous and happy. Do you\nremember what you said to me in the church and how you forced me to\nenter this house? And now this is the way you speak to me, receive me!\nMy God, my God, how you maltreat me!\"\n\nHe stamped his foot and said violently: \"Enough, be silent! I can never\nsee you a moment without hearing that refrain. You were mature when you\ngave yourself to me. I am much obliged to you; I am infinitely\ngrateful, but I need not be tied to your apron-strings until I die! You\nhave a husband and I a wife. Neither of us is free; it was all a\ncaprice, and now it is at an end!\"\n\nShe said: \"How brutal you are, how coarse and villainous! No, I was no\nlonger a young girl, but I had never loved, never wavered in my\ndignity.\"\n\nHe interrupted her: \"I know it, you have told me that twenty times; but\nyou have had two children.\"\n\nShe drew back as if she had been struck: \"Oh, Georges!\" And pressing\nher hands to her heart, she burst into tears.\n\nWhen she began to weep, he took his hat: \"Ah, you are crying again!\nGood evening! Is it for this that you sent for me?\"\n\nShe took a step forward in order to bar the way, and drawing a\nhandkerchief from her pocket she wiped her eyes. Her voice grew\nsteadier: \"No, I came to--to give you--political news--to give you the\nmeans of earning fifty thousand francs--or even more if you wish to.\"\n\nSuddenly softened he asked: \"How?\"\n\n\"By chance last evening I heard a conversation between my husband and\nLaroche. Walter advised the minister not to let you into the secret for\nyou would expose it.\"\n\nDu Roy placed his hat upon a chair and listened attentively.\n\n\"They are going to take possession of Morocco!\"\n\n\"Why, I lunched with Laroche this morning, and he told me the cabinet's\nplans!\"\n\n\"No, my dear, they have deceived you, because they feared their secret\nwould be made known.\"\n\n\"Sit down,\" said Georges.\n\nHe sank into an armchair, while she drew up a stool and took her seat\nat his feet. She continued:\n\n\"As I think of you continually, I pay attention to what is talked of\naround me,\" and she proceeded to tell him what she had heard relative\nto the expedition to Tangiers which had been decided upon the day that\nLaroche assumed his office; she told him how they had little by little\nbought up, through agents who aroused no suspicions, the Moroccan loan,\nwhich had fallen to sixty-four or sixty-five francs; how when the\nexpedition was entered upon the French government would guarantee the\ndebt, and their friends would make fifty or sixty millions.\n\nHe cried: \"Are you sure of that?\"\n\nShe replied: \"Yes, I am sure.\"\n\nHe continued: \"That is indeed fine! As for that rascal of a Laroche,\nlet him beware! I will get his ministerial carcass between my fingers\nyet!\"\n\nThen, after a moment's reflection, he muttered: \"One might profit by\nthat!\"\n\n\"You too can buy some stock,\" said she; \"it is only seventy-two francs.\"\n\nHe replied: \"But I have no ready money.\"\n\nShe raised her eyes to his--eyes full of supplication.\n\n\"I have thought of that, my darling, and if you love me a little, you\nwill let me lend it to you.\"\n\nHe replied abruptly, almost harshly: \"No, indeed.\"\n\nShe whispered imploringly: \"Listen, there is something you can do\nwithout borrowing money. I intended buying ten thousand francs' worth\nof the stock; instead, I will take twenty thousand and you can have\nhalf. There will be nothing to pay at once. If it succeeds, we will\nmake seventy thousand francs; if not, you will owe me ten thousand\nwhich you can repay at your pleasure.\"\n\nHe said again: \"No, I do not like those combinations.\"\n\nShe tried to persuade him by telling him that she advanced\nnothing--that the payments were made by Walter's bank. She pointed out\nto him that he had led the political campaign in \"La Vie Francaise,\"\nand that he would be very simple not to profit by the results he had\nhelped to bring about. As he still hesitated, she added: \"It is in\nreality Walter who will advance the money, and you have done enough for\nhim to offset that sum.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said he, \"I will do it. If we lose I will pay you back ten\nthousand francs.\"\n\nShe was so delighted that she rose, took his head between her hands,\nand kissed him. At first he did not repulse her, but when she grew more\nlavish with her caresses, he said:\n\n\"Come, that will do.\"\n\nShe gazed at him sadly. \"Oh, Georges, I can no longer even embrace you.\"\n\n\"No, not to-day. I have a headache.\"\n\nShe reseated herself with docility at his feet and asked:\n\n\"Will you dine with us to-morrow? It would give me such pleasure,\"\n\nHe hesitated at first, but dared not refuse.\n\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\n\n\"Thank you, dearest.\" She rubbed her cheek against the young man's\nvest; as she did so, one of her long black hairs caught on a button;\nshe twisted it tightly around, then she twisted another around another\nbutton and so on. When he rose, he would tear them out of her head, and\nwould carry away with him unwittingly a lock of her hair. It would be\nan invisible bond between them. Involuntarily he would think, would\ndream of her; he would love her a little more the next day.\n\nSuddenly he said: \"I must leave you, for I am expected at the Chamber\nfor the close of the session. I cannot be absent to-day.\"\n\nShe sighed: \"Already!\" Then adding resignedly: \"Go, my darling, but you\nwill come to dinner tomorrow\"; she rose abruptly. For a moment she felt\na sharp, stinging pain, as if needles had been stuck into her head, but\nshe was glad to have suffered for him.\n\n\"Adieu,\" said she.\n\nHe took her in his arms and kissed her eyes coldly; then she offered\nhim her lips which he brushed lightly as he said: \"Come, come, let us\nhurry; it is after three o'clock.\"\n\nShe passed out before him saying: \"To-morrow at seven\"; he repeated her\nwords and they separated.\n\nDu Roy returned at four o'clock to await his mistress. She was somewhat\nlate because her husband had come home for a week. She asked:\n\n\"Can you come to dinner to-morrow? He will be delighted to see you.\"\n\n\"No; I dine at the Walters. We have a great many political and\nfinancial matters to talk over.\"\n\nShe took off her hat. He pointed to a bag on the mantelpiece: \"I bought\nyou some sweetmeats.\"\n\nShe clapped her hands. \"What a darling you are!\" She took them, tasted\none, and said: \"They are delicious. I shall not leave one. Come, sit\ndown in the armchair, I will sit at your feet and eat my bonbons.\"\n\nHe smiled as he saw her take the seat a short while since occupied by\nMme. Walter. She too, called him \"darling, little one, dearest,\" and\nthe words seemed to him sweet and caressing from her lips, while from\nMme. Walter's they irritated and nauseated him.\n\nSuddenly he remembered the seventy thousand francs he was going to\nmake, and bluntly interrupting Mme. de Marelle's chatter, he said:\n\n\"Listen, my darling; I am going to intrust you with a message to your\nhusband. Tell him from me to buy to-morrow ten thousand francs' worth\nof Moroccan stock which is at seventy-two, and I predict that before\nthree months are passed he will have made eighty thousand francs. Tell\nhim to maintain absolute silence. Tell him that the expedition to\nTangiers, is decided upon, and that the French government will\nguarantee the Moroccan debt. It is a state secret I am confiding to\nyou, remember!\"\n\nShe listened to him gravely and murmured:\n\n\"Thank you. I will tell my husband this evening. You may rely upon him;\nhe will not speak of it; he can be depended upon; there is no danger.\"\n\nShe had eaten all of her bonbons and began to toy with the buttons on\nhis vest. Suddenly she drew a long hair out of the buttonhole and began\nto laugh.\n\n\"See! Here is one of Madeleine's hairs; you are a faithful husband!\"\nThen growing serious, she examined the scarcely perceptible thread more\nclosely and said: \"It is not Madeleine's, it is dark.\"\n\nHe smiled. \"It probably belongs to the housemaid.\"\n\nBut she glanced at the vest with the care of a police-inspector and\nfound a second hair twisted around a second button; then she saw a\nthird; and turning pale and trembling somewhat, she exclaimed: \"Oh,\nsome woman has left hairs around all your buttons.\"\n\nIn surprise, he stammered: \"Why you--you are mad.\"\n\nShe continued to unwind the hairs and cast them upon the floor. With\nher woman's instinct she had divined their meaning and gasped in her\nanger, ready to cry:\n\n\"She loves you and she wished you to carry away with you something of\nhers. Oh, you are a traitor.\" She uttered a shrill, nervous cry: \"Oh,\nit is an old woman's hair--here is a white one--you have taken a fancy\nto an old woman now. Then you do not need me--keep the other one.\" She\nrose.\n\nHe attempted to detain her and stammered: \"No--Clo--you are absurd--I\ndo not know whose it is--listen--stay--see--stay--\"\n\nBut she repeated: \"Keep your old woman--keep her--have a chain made of\nher hair--of her gray hair--there is enough for that--\"\n\nHastily she donned her hat and veil, and when he attempted to touch her\nshe struck him in the face, and made her escape while he was stunned by\nthe blow. When he found that he was alone, he cursed Mme. Walter,\nbathed his face, and went out vowing vengeance. That time he would not\npardon. No, indeed.\n\nHe strolled to the boulevard and stopped at a jeweler's to look at a\nchronometer he had wanted for some time and which would cost eighteen\nhundred francs. He thought with joy: \"If I make my seventy thousand\nfrancs, I can pay for it\"--and he began to dream of all the things he\nwould do when he got the money. First of all he would become a deputy;\nthen he would buy the chronometer; then he would speculate on 'Change,\nand then, and then--he did not enter the office, preferring to confer\nwith Madeleine before seeing Walter again and writing his article; he\nturned toward home. He reached Rue Drouot when he paused; he had\nforgotten to inquire for Count de Vaudrec, who lived on Chaussee\nd'Antin. He retraced his steps with a light heart, thinking of a\nthousand things--of the fortune he would make,--of that rascal of a\nLaroche, and of old Walter.\n\nHe was not at all uneasy as to Clotilde's anger, knowing that she would\nsoon forgive him.\n\nWhen he asked the janitor of the house in which Count de Vaudrec lived:\n\"How is M. de Vaudrec? I have heard that he has been ailing of late,\"\nthe man replied; \"The Count is very ill, sir; they think he will not\nlive through the night; the gout has reached his heart.\"\n\nDu Roy was so startled he did not know what to do! Vaudrec dying! He\nstammered: \"Thanks--I will call again\"--unconscious of what he was\nsaying. He jumped into a cab and drove home. His wife had returned. He\nentered her room out of breath: \"Did you know? Vaudrec is dying!\"\n\nShe was reading a letter and turning to him asked: \"What did you say?\"\n\n\"I said that Vaudrec is dying of an attack of gout.\"\n\nThen he added: \"What shall you do?\"\n\nShe rose; her face was livid; she burst into tears and buried her face\nin her hands. She remained standing, shaken by sobs, torn by anguish.\nSuddenly she conquered her grief and wiping her eyes, said: \"I am going\nto him--do not worry about me--I do not know what time I shall\nreturn--do not expect me.\"\n\nHe replied: \"Very well. Go.\"\n\nThey shook hands and she left in such haste that she forgot her gloves.\nGeorges, after dining alone, began to write his article. He wrote it\naccording to the minister's instructions, hinting to the readers that\nthe expedition to Morocco would not take place. He took it, when\ncompleted, to the office, conversed several moments with M. Walter, and\nset out again, smoking, with a light heart, he knew not why.\n\nHis wife had not returned. He retired and fell asleep. Toward midnight\nMadeleine came home. Georges sat up in bed and asked: \"Well?\"\n\nHe had never seen her so pale and agitated. She whispered: \"He is dead!\"\n\n\"Ah--and--he told you nothing?\"\n\n\"Nothing. He was unconscious when I arrived.\"\n\nQuestions which he dared not ask arose to Georges' lips.\n\n\"Lie down and rest,\" said he.\n\nShe disrobed hastily and slipped into bed.\n\nHe continued: \"Had he any relatives at his death-bed?\"\n\n\"Only a nephew.\"\n\n\"Ah! Did he often see that nephew?\"\n\n\"They had not met for ten years.\"\n\n\"Had he other relatives?\"\n\n\"No, I believe not.\"\n\n\"Will that nephew be his heir?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"Was Vaudrec very rich?\"\n\n\"Yes, very.\"\n\n\"Do you know what he was worth?\"\n\n\"No, not exactly--one or two millions perhaps.\"\n\nHe said no more. She extinguished the light. He could not sleep. He\nlooked upon Mme. Walter's promised seventy thousand francs as very\ninsignificant. Suddenly he thought he heard Madeleine crying. In order\nto insure himself he asked: \"Are you asleep?\"\n\n\"No.\" Her voice was tearful and unsteady.\n\nHe continued: \"I forgot to tell you that your minister has deceived us.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\nHe gave her a detailed account of the combination prepared by Laroche\nand Walter. When he concluded she asked: \"How did you know that?\"\n\nHe replied: \"Pardon me if I do not tell you! You have your means of\nobtaining information into which I do not inquire; I have mine which I\ndesire to keep. I can vouch at any rate for the truth of my statements.\"\n\nShe muttered: \"It may be possible. I suspected that they were doing\nsomething without our knowledge.\"\n\nAs she spoke Georges drew near her; she paid no heed to his proximity,\nhowever, and turning toward the wall, he closed his eyes and fell\nasleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nTHE WILL\n\n\nThe church was draped in black, and over the door a large escutcheon\nsurmounted by a coronet announced to the passers-by that a nobleman was\nbeing buried. The ceremony was just over; those present went out\nslowly, passing by the coffin, and by Count de Vaudrec's nephew, who\nshook hands and returned salutations.\n\nWhen Georges du Roy and his wife left the church, they walked along\nside by side on their way home. They did not speak; they were both\npreoccupied. At length Georges said, as if talking to himself: \"Truly\nit is very astonishing!\"\n\nMadeleine asked: \"What, my friend?\"\n\n\"That Vaudrec left us nothing.\"\n\nShe blushed and said: \"Why should he leave us anything? Had he any\nreason for doing so?\" Then after several moments of silence, she\ncontinued: \"Perhaps there is a will at a lawyer's; we should not know\nof it.\"\n\nHe replied: \"That is possible, for he was our best friend. He dined\nwith us twice a week; he came at any time; he was at home with us. He\nloved you as a father; he had no family, no children, no brothers nor\nsisters, only a nephew. Yes, there should be a will. I would not care\nfor much--a remembrance to prove that he thought of us--that he\nrecognized the affection we felt for him. We should certainly have a\nmark of friendship.\"\n\nShe said with a pensive and indifferent air: \"It is possible that there\nis a will.\"\n\nWhen they entered the house, the footman handed Madeleine a letter. She\nopened it and offered it to her husband.\n\n    \"OFFICE OF M. LAMANEUR,\n     Notary.\n     17 Rue des Vosges,\"\n\n    \"Madame: Kindly call at my office at a quarter past two o'clock\n     Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, on business which concerns\n     you.\"\n\n    \"Yours respectfully,\"\n\n    \"LAMANEUR.\"\n\nGeorges, in his turn, colored.\n\n\"That is as it should be. It is strange, however, that he should write\nto you and not to me, for I am the head of the family legally.\"\n\n\"Shall we go at once?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes, I should like to.\"\n\nAfter luncheon they set out for M. Lamaneur's office.\n\nThe notary was a short, round man--round all over. His head looked like\na ball fastened to another ball, which was supported by legs so short\nthat they too almost resembled balls.\n\nHe bowed, as Du Roy and his wife were shown into his office, pointed to\nseats, and said, turning to Madeleine: \"Madame, I sent for you in order\nto inform you of Count de Vaudrec's will, which will be of interest to\nyou.\"\n\nGeorges could not help muttering: \"I suspected that.\"\n\nThe notary continued: \"I shall read you the document which is very\nbrief.\"\n\n   \"'I, the undersigned, Paul Emile Cyprien Gontran, Count de\n     Vaudrec, sound both in body and mind, here express my last\n     wishes. As death might take me away at any moment, I wish to\n     take the precaution of drawing up my will, to be deposited with\n     M. Lamaneur.'\"\n\n   \"'Having no direct heirs, I bequeath all my fortune, comprising\n     stocks and bonds for six hundred thousand francs and landed\n     property for five hundred thousand, to Mme. Claire Madeleine du\n     Roy unconditionally. I beg her to accept that gift from a dead\n     friend as a proof of devoted, profound, and respectful\n     affection.'\"\n\nThe notary said: \"That is all. That document bears the date of August\nlast, and took the place of one of the same nature made two years ago\nin the name of Mme. Claire Madeleine Forestier. I have the first will,\nwhich would prove, in case of contestation on the part of the family,\nthat Count de Vaudrec had not changed his mind.\"\n\nMadeleine cast down her eyes; her cheeks were pale. Georges nervously\ntwisted his mustache.\n\nThe notary continued after a moment's pause: \"It is of course\nunderstood that Madame cannot accept that legacy without your consent.\"\n\nDu Roy rose and said shortly: \"I ask time for reflection.\"\n\nThe notary smiled, bowed, and replied pleasantly: \"I comprehend the\nscruples which cause you to hesitate. I may add that M. de Vaudrec's\nnephew, who was informed this morning of his uncle's last wishes,\nexpresses himself as ready to respect them if he be given one hundred\nthousand francs. In my opinion the will cannot be broken, but a lawsuit\nwould cause a sensation which you would probably like to avoid. The\nworld often judges uncharitably. Can you let me have your reply before\nSaturday?\"\n\nGeorges bowed, and together with his wife left the office. When they\narrived home, Du Roy closed the door and throwing his hat on the bed,\nasked: \"What were the relations between you and Vaudrec?\"\n\nMadeleine, who was taking off her veil, turned around with a shudder:\n\"Between us?\"\n\n\"Yes, between you and him! One does not leave one's entire fortune to a\nwoman unless--\"\n\nShe trembled, and could scarcely take out the pins which fastened the\ntransparent tissue. Then she stammered in an agitated manner: \"You are\nmad--you are--you are--you did not think--he would leave you anything!\"\n\nGeorges replied, emphazing each word: \"Yes, he could have left me\nsomething; me, your husband, his friend; but not you, my wife and his\nfriend. The distinction is material in the eyes of the world.\"\n\nMadeleine gazed at him fixedly: \"It seems to me that the world would\nhave considered a legacy from him to you very strange.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because,\"--she hesitated, then continued: \"Because you are my husband;\nbecause you were not well acquainted; because I have been his friend so\nlong; because his first will, made during Forestier's lifetime, was\nalready in my favor.\"\n\nGeorges began to pace to and fro. He finally said: \"You cannot accept\nthat.\"\n\nShe answered indifferently: \"Very well; it is not necessary then to\nwait until Saturday; you can inform M. Lamaneur at once.\"\n\nHe paused before her, and they gazed into one another's eyes as if by\nthat mute and ardent interrogation they were trying to examine each\nother's consciences. In a low voice he murmured: \"Come, confess your\nrelations.\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders. \"You are absurd. Vaudrec was very fond of\nme, very, but there was nothing more, never.\"\n\nHe stamped his foot. \"You lie! It is not possible.\"\n\nShe replied calmly: \"It is so, nevertheless.\"\n\nHe resumed his pacing to and fro; then pausing again, he said: \"Explain\nto me, then, why he left all his fortune to you.\"\n\nShe did so with a nonchalant air: \"It is very simple. As you said just\nnow, we were his only friends, or rather, I was his only friend, for he\nknew me when a child. My mother was a governess in his father's house.\nHe came here continually, and as he had no legal heirs, he selected me.\nIt is possible that he even loved me a little. But what woman has never\nbeen loved thus? He brought me flowers every Monday. You were never\nsurprised at that, and he never brought you any. To-day he leaves me\nhis fortune for the same reason, because he had no one else to leave it\nto. It would on the other hand have been extremely surprising if he had\nleft it to you.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"What are you to him?\"\n\nShe spoke so naturally and so calmly that Georges hesitated before\nreplying: \"It makes no difference; we cannot accept that bequest under\nthose conditions. Everyone would talk about it and laugh at me. My\nfellow-journalists are already too much disposed to be jealous of me\nand to attack me. I have to be especially careful of my honor and my\nreputation. I cannot permit my wife to accept a legacy of that kind\nfrom a man whom rumor has already assigned to her as her lover.\nForestier might perhaps have tolerated that, but I shall not.\"\n\nShe replied gently: \"Very well, my dear, we will not take it; it will\nbe a million less in our pockets, that is all.\"\n\nGeorges paced the room and uttered his thoughts aloud, thus speaking to\nhis wife without addressing her:\n\n\"Yes, a million--so much the worse. He did not think when making his\nwill what a breach of etiquette he was committing. He did not realize\nin what a false, ridiculous position he was placing me. He should have\nleft half of it to me--that would have made matters right.\"\n\nHe seated himself, crossed his legs and began to twist the ends of his\nmustache, as was his custom when annoyed, uneasy, or pondering over a\nweighty question.\n\nMadeleine took up a piece of embroidery upon which she worked\noccasionally, and said: \"I have nothing to say. You must decide.\"\n\nIt was some time before he replied; then he said hesitatingly: \"The\nworld would never understand how it was that Vaudrec constituted you\nhis sole heiress and that I allowed it. To accept that legacy would be\nto avow guilty relations on your part and an infamous lack of\nself-respect on mine. Do you know how the acceptance of it might be\ninterpreted? We should have to find some adroit means of palliating it.\nWe should have to give people to suppose, for instance, that he divided\nhis fortune between us, giving half to you and half to me.\"\n\nShe said: \"I do not see how that can be done, since there is a formal\nwill.\"\n\nHe replied: \"Oh, that is very simple. We have no children; you can\ntherefore deed me part of the inheritance. In that way we can silence\nmalignant tongues.\"\n\nShe answered somewhat impatiently: \"I do not see how we can silence\nmalignant tongues since the will is there, signed by Vaudrec.\"\n\nHe said angrily: \"Do you need to exhibit it, or affix it to the door?\nYou are absurd! We will say that the fortune was left us jointly by\nCount de Vaudrec. That is all. You cannot, moreover, accept the legacy\nwithout my authority; I will only consent on the condition of a\npartition which will prevent me from becoming a laughing-stock for the\nworld.\"\n\nShe glanced sharply at him: \"As you will. I am ready.\"\n\nHe seemed to hesitate again, rose, paced the floor, and avoiding his\nwife's piercing gaze, he said: \"No--decidedly no--perhaps it would be\nbetter to renounce it altogether--it would be more correct--more\nhonorable. From the nature of the bequest even charitably-disposed\npeople would suspect illicit relations.\"\n\nHe paused before Madeleine. \"If you like, my darling, I will return to\nM. Lamaneur's alone, to consult him and to explain the matter to him. I\nwill tell him of my scruples and I will add that we have agreed to\ndivide it in order to avoid any scandal. From the moment that I accept\na portion of the inheritance it will be evident that there is nothing\nwrong. I can say: 'My wife accepts it because I, her husband,\naccept'--I, who am the best judge of what she can do without\ncompromising herself.\"\n\nMadeleine simply murmured: \"As you wish.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Yes, it will be as clear as day if that is done. We\ninherit a fortune from a friend who wished to make no distinction\nbetween us, thereby showing that his liking for you was purely\nPlatonic. You may be sure that if he had given it a thought, that is\nwhat he would have done. He did not reflect--he did not foresee the\nconsequences. As you said just now, he offered you flowers every week,\nhe left you his wealth.\"\n\nShe interrupted him with a shade of annoyance:\n\n\"I understand. No more explanations are necessary. Go to the notary at\nonce.\"\n\nHe stammered in confusion: \"You are right; I will go.\" He took his hat,\nand, as he was leaving the room, he asked: \"Shall I try to compromise\nwith the nephew for fifty thousand francs?\"\n\nShe replied haughtily: \"No. Give him the hundred thousand francs he\ndemands, and take them from my share if you wish.\"\n\nAbashed, he murmured: \"No, we will share it. After deducting fifty\nthousand francs each we will still have a million net.\" Then he added:\n\"Until later, my little Made.\"\n\nHe proceeded to the notary's to explain the arrangement decided upon,\nwhich he claimed originated with his wife. The following day they\nsigned a deed for five hundred thousand francs, which Madeleine du Roy\ngave up to her husband.\n\nOn leaving the office, as it was pleasant, Georges proposed that they\ntake a stroll along the boulevards. He was very tender, very careful of\nher, and laughed joyously while she remained pensive and grave.\n\nIt was a cold, autumn day. The pedestrians seemed in haste and walked\nalong rapidly.\n\nDu Roy led his wife to the shop into the windows of which he had so\noften gazed at the coveted chronometer.\n\n\"Shall I buy you some trinket?\" he asked.\n\nShe replied indifferently: \"As you like.\"\n\nThey entered the shop: \"What would you prefer, a necklace, a bracelet,\nor earrings?\"\n\nThe sight of the brilliant gems made her eyes sparkle in spite of\nherself, as she glanced at the cases filled with costly baubles.\n\nSuddenly she exclaimed: \"There is a lovely bracelet.\"\n\nIt was a chain, very unique in shape, every link of which was set with\na different stone.\n\nGeorges asked: \"How much is that bracelet?\"\n\nThe jeweler replied: \"Three thousand francs, sir.\"\n\n\"If you will let me have it for two thousand five hundred, I will take\nit.\"\n\nThe man hesitated, then replied: \"No, sir, it is impossible.\"\n\nDu Roy said: \"See here--throw in this chronometer at fifteen hundred\nfrancs; that makes four thousand, and I will pay cash. If you do not\nagree, I will go somewhere else.\"\n\nThe jeweler finally yielded. \"Very well, sir.\"\n\nThe journalist, after leaving his address, said: \"You can have my\ninitials G. R. C. interlaced below a baron's crown, engraved on the\nchronometer.\"\n\nMadeleine, in surprise, smiled, and when they left the shop, she took\nhis arm quite affectionately. She thought him very shrewd and clever.\nHe was right; now that he had a fortune he must have a title.\n\nThey passed the Vaudeville on their way arid, entering, secured a box.\nThen they repaired to Mme, de Marelle's at Georges' suggestion, to\ninvite her to spend the evening with them. Georges rather dreaded the\nfirst meeting with Clotilde, but she did not seem to bear him any\nmalice, or even to remember their disagreement. The dinner, which they\ntook at a restaurant, was excellent, and the evening altogether\nenjoyable.\n\nGeorges and Madeleine returned home late. The gas was extinguished, and\nin order to light the way the journalist from time to time struck a\nmatch. On reaching the landing on the first floor they saw their\nreflections in the mirror. Du Roy raised his hand with the lighted\nmatch in it, in order to distinguish their images more clearly, and\nsaid, with a triumphant smile:\n\n\"The millionaires are passing by.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nSUZANNE\n\n\nMorocco had been conquered; France, the mistress of Tangiers, had\nguaranteed the debt of the annexed country. It was rumored that two\nministers, Laroche-Mathieu being one of them, had made twenty millions.\n\nAs for Walter, in a few days he had become one of the masters of the\nworld--a financier more omnipotent than a king. He was no longer the\nJew, Walter, the director of a bank, the proprietor of a yellow\nnewspaper; he was M. Walter the wealthy Israelite, and he wished to\nprove it.\n\nKnowing the straitened circumstances of the Prince de Carlsbourg who\nowned one of the fairest mansions on Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore, he\nproposed to buy it. He offered three million francs for it. The prince,\ntempted by the sum, accepted his offer; the next day, Walter took\npossession of his new dwelling. Then another idea occurred to him--an\nidea of conquering all Paris--an idea a la Bonaparte.\n\nAt that time everyone was raving over a painting by the Hungarian, Karl\nMarcovitch, exhibited by Jacques Lenoble and representing \"Christ\nWalking on the Water.\" Art critics enthusiastically declared it to be\nthe most magnificent painting of the age. Walter bought it, thereby\ncausing entire Paris to talk of him, to envy him, to censure or approve\nhis action. He issued an announcement in the papers that everyone was\ninvited to come on a certain evening to see it.\n\nDu Roy was jealous of M. Walter's success. He had thought himself\nwealthy with the five hundred thousand francs extorted from his wife,\nand now he felt poor as he compared his paltry fortune with the shower\nof millions around him. His envious rage increased daily. He cherished\nill will toward everyone--toward the Walters, even toward his wife, and\nabove all toward the man who had deceived him, made use of him, and who\ndined twice a week at his house. Georges acted as his secretary, agent,\nmouthpiece, and when he wrote at his dictation, he felt a mad desire to\nstrangle him. Laroche reigned supreme in the Du Roy household, having\ntaken the place of Count de Vaudrec; he spoke to the servants as if he\nwere their master. Georges submitted to it all, like a dog which wishes\nto bite and dares not. But he was often harsh and brutal to Madeleine,\nwho merely shrugged her shoulders and treated him as one would a\nfretful child. She was surprised, too, at his constant ill humor, and\nsaid: \"I do not understand you. You are always complaining. Your\nposition is excellent.\"\n\nHis only reply was to turn his back upon her. He declared that he would\nnot attend M. Walter's fete--that he would not cross the miserable\nJew's threshold. For two months Mme. Walter had written to him daily,\nbeseeching him to come to see her, to appoint a meeting where he would,\nin order that she might give him the seventy thousand francs she had\nmade for him. He did not reply and threw her letters into the fire. Not\nthat he would have refused to accept his share of the profits, but he\nenjoyed treating her scornfully, trampling her under foot; she was too\nwealthy; he would be inflexible.\n\nThe day of the exhibition of the picture, as Madeleine chided him for\nnot going, he replied: \"Leave me in peace. I shall remain at home.\"\n\nAfter they had dined, he said suddenly, \"I suppose I shall have to go\nthrough with it. Get ready quickly.\"\n\n\"I shall be ready in fifteen minutes,\" she said.\n\nAs they entered the courtyard of the Hotel de Carlsbourg it was one\nblaze of light. A magnificent carpet was spread upon the steps leading\nto the entrance, and upon each one stood a man in livery, as rigid as\nmarble.\n\nDu Roy's heart was torn with jealousy. He and his wife ascended the\nsteps and gave their wraps to the footmen who approached them.\n\nAt the entrance to the drawing-room, two children, one in pink, the\nother in blue, handed bouquets to the ladies.\n\nThe rooms were already well filled. The majority of the ladies were in\nstreet costumes, a proof that they came thither as they would go to any\nexhibition. The few who intended to remain to the ball which was to\nfollow wore evening dress.\n\nMme. Walter, surrounded by friends, stood in the second salon and\nreceived the visitors. Many did not know her, and walked through the\nrooms as if in a museum--without paying any heed to the host and\nhostess.\n\nWhen Virginie perceived Du Roy, she grew livid and made a movement\ntoward him; then she paused and waited for him to advance. He bowed\nceremoniously, while Madeleine greeted her effusively. Georges left his\nwife near Mme. Walter and mingled with the guests. Five drawing-rooms\nopened one into the other; they were carpeted with rich, oriental rugs,\nand upon their walls hung paintings by the old masters. As he made his\nway through the throng, some one seized his arm, and a fresh, youthful\nvoice whispered in his ear: \"Ah, here you are at last, naughty Bel-Ami!\nWhy do we never see you any more?\"\n\nIt was Suzanne Walter, with her azure eyes and wealth of golden hair.\nHe was delighted to see her, and apologized as they shook hands.\n\n\"I have been so busy for two months that I have been nowhere.\"\n\nShe replied gravely: \"That is too bad. You have grieved us deeply, for\nmamma and I adore you. As for myself, I cannot do without you. If you\nare not here, I am bored to death. You see I tell you so frankly, that\nyou will not remain away like that any more. Give me your arm; I will\nshow you 'Christ Walking on the Water' myself; it is at the very end,\nbehind the conservatory. Papa put it back there so that everyone would\nbe obliged to go through the rooms. It is astonishing how proud papa is\nof this house.\"\n\nAs they walked through the rooms, all turned to look at that handsome\nman and that bewitching girl. A well-known painter said: \"There is a\nfine couple.\" Georges thought: \"If my position had been made, I would\nhave married her. Why did I never think of it? How could I have taken\nthe other one? What folly! One always acts too hastily--one never\nreflects sufficiently.\" And longing, bitter longing possessed him,\ncorrupting all his pleasure, rendering life odious.\n\nSuzanne said: \"You must come often, Bel-Ami; we can do anything we like\nnow papa is rich.\"\n\nHe replied: \"Oh, you will soon marry--some prince, perhaps, and we\nshall never meet any more.\"\n\nShe cried frankly: \"Oh, oh, I shall not! I shall choose some one I love\nvery dearly. I am rich enough for two.\"\n\nHe smiled ironically and said: \"I give you six months. By that time you\nwill be Madame la Marquise, Madame la Duchesse, or Madame la Princesse,\nand you will look down upon me, Mademoiselle.\"\n\nShe pretended to be angry, patted his arm with her fan, and vowed that\nshe would marry according to the dictates of her heart.\n\nHe replied: \"We shall see; you are too wealthy.\"\n\n\"You, too, have inherited some money.\"\n\n\"Barely twenty thousand livres a year. It is a mere pittance nowadays.\"\n\n\"But your wife has the same.\"\n\n\"Yes, we have a million together; forty thousand a year. We cannot even\nkeep a carriage on that.\"\n\nThey had, in the meantime, reached the last drawing-room, and before\nthem lay the conservatory with its rare shrubs and plants. To their\nleft, under a dome of palms, was a marble basin, on the edges of which\nfour large swans of delftware emitted the water from their beaks.\n\nThe journalist stopped and said to himself: \"This is luxury; this is\nthe kind of house in which to live. Why can I not have one?\"\n\nHis companion did not speak. He looked at her and thought once more:\n\"If I only had taken her!\"\n\nSuddenly Suzanne seemed to awaken from her reverie. \"Come,\" said she,\ndragging Georges through a group which barred their way, and turning\nhim to the right. Before him, surrounded by verdure on all sides, was\nthe picture. One had to look closely at it in order to understand it.\nIt was a grand work--the work of a master--one of those triumphs of art\nwhich furnishes one for years with food for thought.\n\nDu Roy gazed at it for some time, and then turned away, to make room\nfor others. Suzanne's tiny hand still rested upon his arm. She asked:\n\n\"Would you like a glass of champagne? We will go to the buffet; we\nshall find papa there.\"\n\nSlowly they traversed the crowded rooms. Suddenly Georges heard a voice\nsay: \"That is Laroche and Mme. du Roy.\"\n\nHe turned and saw his wife passing upon the minister's arm. They were\ntalking in low tones and smiling into each other's eyes. He fancied he\nsaw some people whisper, as they gazed at them, and he felt a desire to\nfall upon those two beings and smite them to the earth. His wife was\nmaking a laughing-stock of him. Who was she? A shrewd little parvenue,\nthat was all. He could never make his way with a wife who compromised\nhim. She would be a stumbling-block in his path. Ah, if he had\nforeseen, if he had known. He would have played for higher stakes. What\na brilliant match he might have made with little Suzanne! How could he\nhave been so blind?\n\nThey reached the dining-room with its marble columns and walls hung\nwith old Gobelins tapestry. Walter spied his editor, and hastened to\nshake hands. He was beside himself with joy. \"Have you seen everything?\nSay, Suzanne, have you shown him everything? What a lot of people, eh?\nHave you seen Prince de Guerche? he just drank a glass of punch.\" Then\nhe pounced upon Senator Rissolin and his wife.\n\nA gentleman greeted Suzanne--a tall, slender man with fair whiskers and\na worldly air. Georges heard her call him Marquis de Cazolles, and he\nwas suddenly inspired with jealousy. How long had she known him? Since\nshe had become wealthy no doubt. He saw in him a possible suitor. Some\none seized his arm. It was Norbert de Varenne. The old poet said: \"This\nis what they call amusing themselves. After a while they will dance,\nthen they will retire, and the young girls will be satisfied. Take some\nchampagne; it is excellent.\"\n\nGeorges scarcely heard his words. He was looking for Suzanne, who had\ngone off with the Marquis de Cazolles; he left Norbert de Varenne\nabruptly and went in pursuit of the young girl. The thirsty crowd\nstopped him; when he had made his way through it, he found himself face\nto face with M. and Mme. de Marelle. He had often met the wife, but he\nhad not met the husband for some time; the latter grasped both of his\nhands and thanked him for the message he had sent him by Clotilde\nrelative to the stocks.\n\nDu Roy replied: \"In exchange for that service I shall take your wife,\nor rather offer her my arm. Husband and wife should always be\nseparated.\"\n\nM. de Marelle bowed. \"Very well. If I lose you we can meet here again\nin an hour.\"\n\nThe two young people disappeared in the crowd, followed by the husband.\nMme. de Marelle said: \"There are two girls who will have twenty or\nthirty millions each, and Suzanne is pretty in the bargain.\"\n\nHe made no reply; his own thought coming from the lips of another\nirritated him. He took Clotilde to see the painting. As they crossed\nthe conservatory he saw his wife seated near Laroche-Mathieu, both of\nthem almost hidden behind a group of plants. They seemed to say: \"We\nare having a meeting in public, for we do not care for the world's\nopinion.\"\n\nMme. de Marelle admired Karl Marcovitch's painting, and they turned to\nrepair to the other rooms. They were separated from M. de Marelle. He\nasked: \"Is Laurine still vexed with me?\"\n\n\"Yes. She refuses to see you and goes away when you are mentioned.\"\n\nHe did not reply. The child's sudden enmity grieved and annoyed him.\n\nSuzanne met them at a door and cried: \"Oh, here you are! Now, Bel-Ami,\nyou are going to be left alone, for I shall take Clotilde to see my\nroom.\" And the two women glided through the throng. At that moment a\nvoice at his side murmured: \"Georges!\"\n\nIt was Mme. Walter. She continued in a low voice: \"How cruel you are!\nHow needlessly you inflict suffering upon me. I bade Suzanne take that\nwoman away that I might have a word with you. Listen: I must speak to\nyou this evening--or--or--you do not know what I shall do. Go into the\nconservatory. You will find a door to the left through which you can\nreach the garden. Follow the walk directly in front of you. At the end\nof it you will see an arbor. Expect me in ten minutes. If you do not\nmeet me, I swear I will cause a scandal here at once!\"\n\nHe replied haughtily: \"Very well, I shall be at the place you named in\nten minutes.\"\n\nBut Jacques Rival detained him. When he reached the alley, he saw Mme.\nWalter in front of him; she cried: \"Ah, here you are! Do you wish to\nkill me?\"\n\nHe replied calmly: \"I beseech you, none of that, or I shall leave you\nat once.\"\n\nThrowing her arms around his neck, she exclaimed: \"What have I done to\nyou that you should treat me so?\"\n\nHe tried to push her away: \"You twisted your hair around my coat\nbuttons the last time we met, and it caused trouble between my wife and\nmyself.\"\n\nShe shook her head: \"Ah, your wife would not care. It was one of your\nmistresses who made a scene.\"\n\n\"I have none.\"\n\n\"Indeed! Why do you never come to see me? Why do you refuse to dine\nwith me even once a week? I have no other thoughts than of you. I\nsuffer terribly. You cannot understand that your image, always present,\ncloses my throat, stifles me, and leaves me scarcely strength enough to\nmove my limbs in order to walk. So I remain all day in my chair\nthinking of you.\"\n\nHe looked at her in astonishment. These were the words of a desperate\nwoman, capable of anything. He, however, cherished a vague project and\nreplied: \"My dear, love is not eternal. One loves and one ceases to\nlove. When it lasts it becomes a drawback. I want none of it! However,\nif you will be reasonable, and will receive and treat me as a friend, I\nwill come to see you as formerly. Can you do that?\"\n\nShe murmured: \"I can do anything in order to see you.\"\n\n\"Then it is agreed that we are to be friends, nothing more.\"\n\nShe gasped: \"It is agreed\"; offering him her lips she cried in her\ndespair: \"One more kiss--one last kiss!\"\n\nHe gently drew back. \"No, we must adhere to our rules.\"\n\nShe turned her head and wiped away two tears, then drawing from her\nbosom a package of notes tied with pink ribbon, she held it toward Du\nRoy: \"Here is your share of the profits in that Moroccan affair. I was\nso glad to make it for you. Here, take it.\"\n\nHe refused: \"No, I cannot accept that money.\"\n\nShe became excited: \"Oh, you will not refuse it now! It is yours, yours\nalone. If you do not take it, I will throw it in the sewer. You will\nnot refuse it, Georges!\"\n\nHe took the package and slipped it into his pocket \"We must return to\nthe house; you will take cold.\"\n\n\"So much the better; if I could but die!\"\n\nShe seized his hand, kissed it passionately, and fled toward the house.\nHe returned more leisurely, and entered the conservatory with head\nerect and smiling lips. His wife and Laroche were no longer there. The\ncrowd had grown thinner. Suzanne, leaning on her sister's arm, advanced\ntoward him. In a few moments, Rose, whom they teased about a certain\nCount, turned upon her heel and left them.\n\nDu Roy, finding himself alone with Suzanne, said in a caressing voice:\n\"Listen, my dear little one; do you really consider me a friend?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, Bel-Ami.\"\n\n\"You have faith in me?\"\n\n\"Perfect faith.\"\n\n\"Do you remember what I said to you a while since?\"\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\"About your marriage, or rather the man you would marry.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, will you promise me one thing?\"\n\n\"Yes; what is it?\"\n\n\"To consult me when you receive a proposal and to accept no one without\nasking my advice.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will gladly.\"\n\n\"And it is to be a secret between us--not a word to your father or\nmother.\"\n\n\"Not a word.\"\n\nRival approached them saying: \"Mademoiselle, your father wants you in\nthe ballroom.\"\n\nShe said: \"Come, Bel-Ami,\" but he refused, for he had decided to leave\nat once, wishing to be alone with his thoughts. He went in search of\nhis wife, and found her drinking chocolate at the buffet with two\nstrange men. She introduced her husband without naming them.\n\nIn a short while, he asked: \"Shall we go?\"\n\n\"Whenever you like.\"\n\nShe took his arm and they passed through the almost deserted rooms.\n\nMadeleine asked: \"Where is Mme. Walter; I should like to bid her\ngood-bye.\"\n\n\"It is unnecessary. She would try to keep us in the ballroom, and I\nhave had enough.\"\n\n\"You are right.\"\n\nOn the way home they did not speak. But when they had entered their\nroom, Madeleine, without even taking off her veil, said to him with a\nsmile: \"I have a surprise for you.\"\n\nHe growled ill-naturedly: \"What is it?\"\n\n\"Guess.\"\n\n\"I cannot make the effort.\"\n\n\"The day after to-morrow is the first of January.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It is the season for New Year's gifts.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Here is yours, which Laroche handed me just now.\" She gave him a small\nblack box which resembled a jewel-casket.\n\nHe opened it indifferently and saw the cross of the Legion of Honor. He\nturned a trifle pale, then smiled, and said: \"I should have preferred\nten millions. That did not cost him much.\"\n\nShe had expected a transport of delight and was irritated by his\nindifference.\n\n\"You are incomprehensible. Nothing seems to satisfy you.\"\n\nHe replied calmly: \"That man is only paying his debts; he owes me a\ngreat deal more.\"\n\nShe was astonished at his tone, and said: \"It is very nice, however, at\nyour age.\"\n\nHe replied: \"I should have much more.\"\n\nHe took the casket, placed it on the mantelpiece, and looked for some\nminutes at the brilliant star within it, then he closed it with a shrug\nof his shoulders and began to prepare to retire.\n\n\"L'Officiel\" of January 1 announced that M. Prosper Georges du Roy had\nbeen decorated with the Legion of Honor for exceptional services. The\nname was written in two words, and that afforded Georges more pleasure\nthan the decoration itself.\n\nAn hour after having read that notice, he received a note from Mme.\nWalter, inviting him to come and bring his wife to dine with them that\nevening, to celebrate his distinction.\n\nAt first he hesitated, then throwing the letter in the fire, he said to\nMadeleine: \"We shall dine at the Walters' this evening.\"\n\nIn her surprise she exclaimed: \"Why, I thought you would never set your\nfoot in their house again.\"\n\nHis sole reply was: \"I have changed my mind.\"\n\nWhen they arrived at Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore, they found Mme.\nWalter alone in the dainty boudoir in which she received her intimate\nfriends. She was dressed in black and her hair was powdered. At a\ndistance she appeared like an old lady, in proximity, like a youthful\none.\n\n\"Are you in mourning?\" asked, Madeleine.\n\nShe replied sadly: \"Yes and no. I have lost none of my relatives, but I\nhave arrived at an age when one should wear somber colors. I wear it\nto-day to inaugurate it; hitherto I have worn it in my heart.\"\n\nThe dinner was somewhat tedious. Suzanne alone talked incessantly. Rose\nseemed preoccupied. The journalist was overwhelmed with\ncongratulations, after the meal, when all repaired to the\ndrawing-rooms. Mme. Walter detained him as they were about to enter the\nsalon, saying: \"I will never speak of anything to you again, only come\nto see me, Georges. It is impossible for me to live without you. I see\nyou, I feel you, in my heart all day and all night. It is as if I had\ndrunk a poison which preyed upon me. I cannot bear it. I would rather\nbe as an old woman to you. I powdered my hair for that reason to-night;\nbut come here--come from time to time as a friend.\"\n\nHe replied calmly: \"Very well. It is unnecessary to speak of it again.\nYou see I came to-day on receipt of your letter.\"\n\nWalter, who had preceded them, with his two daughters and Madeleine,\nawaited Du Roy near the picture of \"Christ Walking on the Water.\"\n\n\"Only think,\" said he, \"I found my wife yesterday kneeling before that\npainting as if in a chapel. She was praying!\"\n\nMme. Walter replied in a firm voice, in a voice in which vibrated a\nsecret exaltation: \"That Christ will save my soul. He gives me fresh\ncourage and strength every time that I look at Him.\" And pausing before\nthe picture, she murmured: \"How beautiful He is! How frightened those\nmen are, and how they love Him! Look at His head, His eyes, how simple\nand supernatural He is at the same time!\"\n\nSuzanne cried: \"Why, He looks like you, Bel-Ami! I am sure He looks\nlike you. The resemblance is striking.\"\n\nShe made him stand beside the painting and everyone recognized the\nlikeness. Du Roy was embarrassed. Walter thought it very singular;\nMadeleine, with a smile, remarked that Jesus looked more manly. Mme.\nWalter stood by motionless, staring fixedly at her lover's face, her\ncheeks as white as her hair.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nDIVORCE\n\n\nDuring the remainder of the winter, the Du Roys often visited the\nWalters. Georges, too, frequently dined there alone, Madeleine pleading\nfatigue and preferring to remain at home. He had chosen Friday as his\nday, and Mme. Walter never invited anyone else on that evening; it\nbelonged to Bel-Ami. Often in a dark corner or behind a tree in the\nconservatory, Mme. Walter embraced the young man and whispered in his\near: \"I love you, I love you! I love you desperately!\"\n\nBut he always repulsed her coldly, saying: \"If you persist in that, I\nwill not come again.\"\n\nToward the end of March people talked of the marriage of the two\nsisters: Rose was to marry, Dame Rumor said, Count de Latour-Ivelin and\nSuzanne, the Marquis de Cazolles. The subject of Suzanne's possible\nmarriage had not been broached again between her and Georges until one\nmorning, the latter having been brought home by M. Walter to lunch, he\nwhispered to Suzanne: \"Come, let us give the fish some bread.\"\n\nThey proceeded to the conservatory in which was the marble basin\ncontaining the fish. As Georges and Suzanne leaned over its edge, they\nsaw their reflections in the water and smiled at them. Suddenly, he\nsaid in a low voice: \"It is not right of you to keep secrets from me,\nSuzanne.\"\n\nShe asked:\n\n\"What secrets, Bel-Ami?\"\n\n\"Do you remember what you promised me here the night of the fete?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"To consult me every time you received a proposal.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, you have received one!\"\n\n\"From whom?\"\n\n\"You know very well.\"\n\n\"No, I swear I do not.\"\n\n\"Yes, you do. It is from that fop of a Marquis de Cazolles.\"\n\n\"He is not a fop.\"\n\n\"That may be, but he is stupid. He is no match for you who are so\npretty, so fresh, so bright!\"\n\nShe asked with a smile: \"What have you against him?\"\n\n\"I? Nothing!\"\n\n\"Yes, you have. He is not all that you say he is.\"\n\n\"He is a fool, and an intriguer.\"\n\nShe glanced at him: \"What ails you?\"\n\nHe spoke as if tearing a secret from the depths of his heart: \"I am--I\nam jealous of him.\"\n\nShe was astonished.\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"Yes, I.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I love you and you know it\"\n\nThen she said severely: \"You are mad, Bel-Ami!\"\n\nHe replied: \"I know that I am! Should I confess it--I, a married man,\nto you, a young girl? I am worse than mad--I am culpable, wretched--I\nhave no possible hope, and that thought almost destroys my reason. When\nI hear that you are going to be married, I feel murder in my heart. You\nmust forgive me, Suzanne.\"\n\nHe paused. The young girl murmured half sadly, half gaily: \"It is a\npity that you are married; but what can you do? It cannot be helped.\"\n\nHe turned toward her abruptly and said: \"If I were free would you marry\nme?\"\n\nShe replied: \"Yes, Bel-Ami, I would marry you because I love you better\nthan any of the others.\"\n\nHe rose and stammering: \"Thanks--thanks--do not, I implore you, say yes\nto anyone. Wait a while. Promise me.\"\n\nSomewhat confused, and without comprehending what he asked, she\nwhispered: \"I promise.\"\n\nDu Roy threw a large piece of bread into the water and fled, without\nsaying adieu, as if he were beside himself. Suzanne, in surprise,\nreturned to the salon.\n\nWhen Du Roy arrived home, he asked Madeleine, who was writing letters:\n\"Shall you dine at the Walters' Friday? I am going.\"\n\nShe hesitated: \"No, I am not well. I prefer to remain here.\"\n\n\"As you like. No one will force you.\" Then he took up his hat and went\nout.\n\nFor some time he had watched and followed her, knowing all her actions.\nThe time he had awaited had come at length.\n\nOn Friday he dressed early, in order, as he said, to make several calls\nbefore going to M. Walter's. At about six o'clock, after having kissed\nhis wife, he went in search of a cab. He said to the cabman: \"You can\nstop at No. 17 Rue Fontaine, and remain there until I order you to go\non. Then you can take me to the restaurant Du Coq-Faisan, Rue\nLafayette.\"\n\nThe cab rolled slowly on; Du Roy lowered the shades. When in front of\nhis house, he kept watch of it. After waiting ten minutes, he saw\nMadeleine come out and go toward the boulevards. When she was out of\nearshot, he put his head out of the window and cried: \"Go on!\"\n\nThe cab proceeded on its way and stopped at the Coq-Faisan. Georges\nentered the dining-room and ate slowly, looking at his watch from time\nto time. At seven-thirty he left and drove to Rue La Rochefoucauld. He\nmounted to the third story of a house in that street, and asked the\nmaid who opened the door: \"Is M. Guibert de Lorme at home?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nHe was shown into the drawing-room, and after waiting some time, a tall\nman with a military bearing and gray hair entered. He was the police\ncommissioner.\n\nDu Roy bowed, then said: \"As I suspected, my wife is with her lover in\nfurnished apartments they have rented on Rue des Martyrs.\"\n\nThe magistrate bowed: \"I am at your service, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well, I have a cab below.\" And with three other officers they\nproceeded to the house in which Du Roy expected to surprise his wife.\nOne officer remained at the door to watch the exit; on the second floor\nthey halted; Du Roy rang the bell and they waited. In two or three\nminutes Georges rang again several times in succession. They heard a\nlight step approach, and a woman's voice, evidently disguised, asked:\n\n\"Who is there?\"\n\nThe police officer replied: \"Open in the name of the law.\"\n\nThe voice repeated: \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I am the police commissioner. Open, or I will force the door.\"\n\nThe voice continued: \"What do you want?\"\n\nDu Roy interrupted: \"It is I; it is useless to try to escape us.\"\n\nThe footsteps receded and then returned. Georges said: \"If you do not\nopen, we will force the door.\"\n\nReceiving no reply he shook the door so violently that the old lock\ngave way, and the young man almost fell over Madeleine, who was\nstanding in the antechamber in her petticoat, her hair loosened, her\nfeet bare, and a candle in her hand.\n\nHe exclaimed: \"It is she. We have caught them,\" and he rushed into the\nroom. The commissioner turned to Madeleine, who had followed them\nthrough the rooms, in one of which were the remnants of a supper, and\nlooking into her eyes said:\n\n\"You are Mme. Claire Madeleine du Roy, lawful wife of M. Prosper\nGeorges du Roy, here present?\"\n\nShe replied: \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"What are you doing here?\"\n\nShe made no reply. The officer repeated his question; still she did not\nreply. He waited several moments and then said: \"If you do not confess,\nMadame, I shall be forced to inquire into the matter.\"\n\nThey could see a man's form concealed beneath the covers of the bed. Du\nRoy advanced softly and uncovered the livid face of M. Laroche-Mathieu.\n\nThe officer again asked: \"Who are you?\"\n\nAs the man did not reply, he continued: \"I am the police commissioner\nand I call upon you to tell me your name. If you do not answer, I shall\nbe forced to arrest you. In any case, rise. I will interrogate you when\nyou are dressed.\"\n\nIn the meantime Madeleine had regained her composure, and seeing that\nall was lost, she was determined to put a brave face upon the matter.\nHer eyes sparkled with the audacity of bravado, and taking a piece of\npaper she lighted the ten candles in the candelabra as if for a\nreception. That done, she leaned against the mantelpiece, took a\ncigarette out of a case, and began to smoke, seeming not to see her\nhusband.\n\nIn the meantime the man in the bed had dressed himself and advanced.\nThe officer turned to him: \"Now, sir, will you tell me who you are?\"\n\nHe made no reply.\n\n\"I see I shall have to arrest you.\"\n\nThen the man cried: \"Do not touch me. I am inviolable.\"\n\nDu Roy rushed toward him exclaiming: \"I can have you arrested if I want\nto!\" Then he added: \"This man's name is Laroche-Mathieu, minister of\nforeign affairs.\"\n\nThe officer retreated and stammered: \"Sir, will you tell me who you\nare?\"\n\n\"For once that miserable fellow has not lied. I am indeed\nLaroche-Mathieu, minister,\" and pointing to Georges' breast, he added,\n\"and that scoundrel wears upon his coat the cross of honor which I gave\nhim.\"\n\nDu Roy turned pale. With a rapid gesture he tore the decoration from\nhis buttonhole and throwing it in the fire exclaimed: \"That is what a\ndecoration is worth which is given by a scoundrel of your order.\"\n\nThe commissioner stepped between them, as they stood face to face,\nsaying: \"Gentlemen, you forget yourselves and your dignity.\"\n\nMadeleine smoked on calmly, a smile hovering about her lips. The\nofficer continued: \"Sir, I have surprised you alone with Mme. du Roy\nunder suspicious circumstances; what have you to say?\"\n\n\"Nothing; do your duty.\"\n\nThe commissioner turned to Madeleine: \"Do you confess, Madame, that\nthis gentleman is your lover?\"\n\nShe replied boldly: \"I do not deny it. That is sufficient.\"\n\nThe magistrate made several notes; when he had finished writing, the\nminister, who stood ready, coat upon arm, hat in hand, asked: \"Do you\nneed me any longer, sir? Can I go?\"\n\nDu Roy addressed him with an insolent smile: \"Why should you go, we\nhave finished; we will leave you alone together.\" Then, taking the\nofficer's arm, he said: \"Let us go, sir; we have nothing more to do in\nthis place.\"\n\nAn hour later Georges du Roy entered the office of \"La Vie Francaise.\"\nM. Walter was there; he raised his head and asked: \"What, are you here?\nWhy are you not dining at my house? Where have you come from?\"\n\nGeorges replied with emphasis: \"I have just found out something about\nthe minister of foreign affairs.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I found him alone with my wife in hired apartments. The commissioner\nof police was my witness. The minister is ruined.\"\n\n\"Are you not jesting?\"\n\n\"No, I am not. I shall even write an article on it.\"\n\n\"What is your object?\"\n\n\"To overthrow that wretch, that public malefactor.\"\n\nGeorges placed his hat upon a chair and added: \"Woe to those whom I\nfind in my path. I never pardon.\"\n\nThe manager stammered: \"But your wife?\"\n\n\"I shall apply for a divorce at once.\"\n\n\"A divorce?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am master of the situation. I shall be free. I have a stated\nincome. I shall offer myself as a candidate in October in my native\ndistrict, where I am known. I could not win any respect were I to be\nhampered with a wife whose honor was sullied. She took me for a\nsimpleton, but since I have known her game, I have watched her, and now\nI shall get on, for I shall be free.\"\n\nGeorges rose.\n\n\"I will write the item; it must be handled prudently.\"\n\nThe old man hesitated, then said: \"Do so: it serves those right who are\ncaught in such scrapes.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nTHE FINAL PLOT\n\n\nThree months had elapsed. Georges du Roy's divorce had been obtained.\nHis wife had resumed the name of Forestier.\n\nAs the Walters were going to Trouville on the fifteenth of July, they\ndecided to spend a day in the country before starting.\n\nThe day chosen was Thursday, and they set out at nine o'clock in the\nmorning in a large six-seated carriage drawn by four horses. They were\ngoing to lunch at Saint-Germain. Bel-Ami had requested that he might be\nthe only young man in the party, for he could not bear the presence of\nthe Marquis de Cazolles. At the last moment, however, it was decided\nthat Count de Latour-Ivelin should go, for he and Rose had been\nbetrothed a month. The day was delightful. Georges, who was very pale,\ngazed at Suzanne as they sat in the carriage and their eyes met.\n\nMme. Walter was contented and happy. The luncheon was a long and merry\none. Before leaving for Paris, Du Roy proposed a walk on the terrace.\nThey stopped on the way to admire the view; as they passed on, Georges\nand Suzanne lingered behind. The former whispered softly: \"Suzanne, I\nlove you madly.\"\n\nShe whispered in return: \"I love you too, Bel-Ami.\"\n\nHe continued: \"If I cannot have you for my wife, I shall leave the\ncountry.\"\n\nShe replied: \"Ask papa. Perhaps he will consent.\"\n\nHe answered impatiently: \"No, I repeat that it is useless; the door of\nthe house would be closed against me. I would lose my position on the\njournal, and we would not even meet. Those are the consequences a\nformal proposal would produce. They have promised you to the Marquis de\nCazolles; they hope you will finally say 'yes' and they are waiting.\"\n\n\"What can we do?\"\n\n\"Have you the courage to brave your father and mother for my sake?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Truly?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well! There is only one way. It must come from you and not from me.\nYou are an indulged child; they let you say anything and are not\nsurprised at any audacity on your part. Listen, then! This evening on\nreturning home, go to your mother first, and tell her that you want to\nmarry me. She will be very much agitated and very angry.\"\n\nSuzanne interrupted him: \"Oh, mamma would be glad.\"\n\nHe replied quickly: \"No, no, you do not know her. She will be more\nvexed than your father. But you must insist, you must not yield; you\nmust repeat that you will marry me and me alone. Will you do so?\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"And on leaving your mother, repeat the same thing to your father very\ndecidedly.\"\n\n\"Well, and then--\"\n\n\"And then matters will reach a climax! If you are determined to be my\nwife, my dear, dear, little Suzanne, I will elope with you.\"\n\nShe clapped her hands, as all the charming adventures in the romances\nshe had read occurred to her, and cried:\n\n\"Oh, what bliss! When will you elope with me?\"\n\nHe whispered very low: \"To-night!\"\n\n\"Where shall we go?\"\n\n\"That is my secret. Think well of what you are doing. Remember that\nafter that flight you must become my wife. It is the only means, but it\nis dangerous--very dangerous--for you.\"\n\n\"I have decided. Where shall I meet you?\"\n\n\"Meet me about midnight in the Place de la Concorde.\"\n\n\"I will be there.\"\n\nHe clasped her hand. \"Oh, how I love you! How brave and good you are!\nThen you do not want to marry Marquis de Cazolles?\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\"\n\nMme. Walter, turning her head, called out: \"Come, little one; what are\nyou and Bel-Ami doing?\"\n\nThey rejoined the others and returned by way of Chatou. When the\ncarriage arrived at the door of the mansion, Mme. Walter pressed\nGeorges to dine with them, but he refused, and returned home to look\nover his papers and destroy any compromising letters. Then he repaired\nin a cab with feverish haste to the place of meeting. He waited there\nsome time, and thinking his ladylove had played him false, he was about\nto drive off, when a gentle voice whispered at the door of his cab:\n\"Are you there, Bel-Ami?\"\n\n\"Is it you, Suzanne?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Ah, get in.\" She entered the cab and he bade the cabman drive on.\n\nHe asked: \"Well, how did it all pass off?\"\n\nShe murmured faintly:\n\n\"Oh, it was terrible, with mamma especially.\"\n\n\"Your mamma? What did she say? Tell me!\"\n\n\"Oh, it was frightful! I entered her room and made the little speech I\nhad prepared. She turned pale and cried: 'Never!' I wept, I protested\nthat I would marry only you; she was like a mad woman; she vowed I\nshould be sent to a convent. I never saw her like that, never. Papa,\nhearing her agitated words, entered. He was not as angry as she was,\nbut he said you were not a suitable match for me. As they had vexed me,\nI talked louder than they, and papa with a dramatic air bade me leave\nthe room. That decided me to fly with you. And here I am; where shall\nwe go?\"\n\nHe replied, encircling her waist with his arm: \"It is too late to take\nthe train; this cab will take us to Sevres where we can spend the\nnight, and to-morrow we will leave for La Roche-Guyon. It is a pretty\nvillage on the banks of the Seine between Mantes and Bonnieres.\"\n\nThe cab rolled on. Georges took the young girl's hand and kissed it\nrespectfully. He did not know what to say to her, being unaccustomed to\nPlatonic affection. Suddenly he perceived that she was weeping. He\nasked in affright:\n\n\"What ails you, my dear little one?\"\n\nShe replied tearfully: \"I was thinking that poor mamma could not sleep\nif she had found out that I was gone!\"\n\n      *       *       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer mother indeed was not asleep.\n\nWhen Suzanne left the room, Mine. Walter turned to her husband and\nasked in despair: \"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"It means that that intriguer has influenced her. It is he who has made\nher refuse Cazolles. You have flattered and cajoled him, too. It was\nBel-Ami here, Bel-Ami there, from morning until night. Now you are paid\nfor it!\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes, you. You are as much infatuated with him as Madeleine, Suzanne,\nand the rest of them. Do you think that I did not see that you could\nnot exist for two days without him?\"\n\nShe rose tragically: \"I will not allow you to speak to me thus. You\nforget that I was not brought up like you, in a shop.\"\n\nWith an oath, he left the room, banging the door behind him.\n\nWhen he was gone, she thought over all that had taken place. Suzanne\nwas in love with Bel-Ami, and Bel-Ami wanted to marry Suzanne! No, it\nwas not true! She was mistaken; he would not be capable of such an\naction; he knew nothing of Suzanne's escapade. They would take Suzanne\naway for six months and that would end it.\n\nShe rose, saying: \"I cannot rest in this uncertainty. I shall lose my\nreason. I will arouse Suzanne and question her.\"\n\nShe proceeded to her daughter's room. She entered; it was empty; the\nbed had not been slept in. A horrible suspicion possessed her and she\nflew to her husband. He was in bed, reading.\n\nShe gasped: \"Have you seen Suzanne?\"\n\n\"No--why?\"\n\n\"She is--gone! she is not in her room.\"\n\nWith one bound he was out of bed; he rushed to his daughter's room; not\nfinding her there, he sank into a chair. His wife had followed him.\n\n\"Well?\" she asked.\n\nHe had not the strength to reply: he was no longer angry; he groaned:\n\"He has her--we are lost.\"\n\n\"Lost, how?\"\n\n\"Why, he must marry her now!\"\n\nShe cried wildly: \"Marry her, never! Are you mad?\"\n\nHe replied sadly: \"It will do no good to yell! He has disgraced her.\nThe best thing to be done is to give her to him, and at once, too; then\nno one will know of this escapade.\"\n\nShe repeated in great agitation: \"Never; he shall never have Suzanne.\"\n\nOvercome, Walter murmured: \"But he has her. And he will keep her as\nlong as we do not yield; therefore, to avoid a scandal we must do so at\nonce.\"\n\nBut his wife replied: \"No, no, I will never consent.\"\n\nImpatiently he returned: \"It is a matter of necessity. Ah, the\nscoundrel--how he has deceived us! But he is shrewd at any rate. She\nmight have done better as far as position, but not intelligence and\nfuture, is concerned. He is a promising young man. He will be a deputy\nor a minister some day.\"\n\nMme. Walter, however, repeated wildly: \"I will never let him marry\nSuzanne! Do you hear--never!\"\n\nIn his turn he became incensed, and like a practical man defended\nBel-Ami. \"Be silent! I tell you he must marry her! And who knows?\nPerhaps we shall not regret it! With men of his stamp one never knows\nwhat may come about. You saw how he downed Laroche-Mathieu in three\narticles, and that with a dignity which was very difficult to maintain\nin his position as husband. So, we shall see.\"\n\nMme. Walter felt a desire to cry aloud and tear her hair. But she only\nrepeated angrily: \"He shall not have her!\"\n\nWalter rose, took up his lamp, and said: \"You are silly, like all\nwomen! You only act on impulse. You do not know how to accommodate\nyourself to circumstances. You are stupid! I tell you he shall marry\nher; it is essential.\" And he left the room.\n\nMme. Walter remained alone with her suffering, her despair. If only a\npriest were at hand! She would cast herself at his feet and confess all\nher errors and her agony--he would prevent the marriage! Where could\nshe find a priest? Where should she turn? Before her eyes floated, like\na vision, the calm face of \"Christ Walking on the Water,\" as she had\nseen it in the painting. He seemed to say to her: \"Come unto Me. Kneel\nat My feet. I will comfort and instruct you as to what to do.\"\n\nShe took the lamp and sought the conservatory; she opened the door\nleading into the room which held the enormous canvas, and fell upon her\nknees before it. At first she prayed fervently, but as she raised her\neyes and saw the resemblance to Bel-Ami, she murmured: \"Jesus--Jesus--\"\nwhile her thoughts were with her daughter and her lover. She uttered a\nwild cry, as she pictured them together--alone--and fell into a swoon.\nWhen day broke they found Mme. Walter still lying unconscious before\nthe painting. She was so ill, after that, that her life was almost\ndespaired of.\n\nM. Walter explained his daughter's absence to the servants by saying to\nthem that she had been sent to a convent for a short time. Then he\nreplied to a long letter from Du Roy, giving his consent to his\nmarriage with his daughter. Bel-Ami had posted that epistle when he\nleft Paris, having prepared it the night of his departure. In it he\nsaid in respectful terms that he had loved the young girl a long time;\nthat there had never been any understanding between them, but that as\nshe came to him to say: \"I will be your wife,\" he felt authorized in\nkeeping her, in hiding her, in fact, until he had obtained a reply from\nher parents, whose wishes were to him of more value than those of his\nbetrothed.\n\nGeorges and Suzanne spent a week at La Roche-Guyon. Never had the young\ngirl enjoyed herself so thoroughly. As she passed for his sister, they\nlived in a chaste and free intimacy, a kind of living companionship. He\nthought it wiser to treat her with respect, and when he said to her:\n\"We will return to Paris to-morrow; your father has bestowed your hand\nupon me\" she whispered naively: \"Already? This is just as pleasant as\nbeing your wife.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nATTAINMENT\n\n\nIt was dark in the apartments in the Rue de Constantinople, when\nGeorges du Roy and Clotilde de Marelle, having met at the door, entered\nthem. Without giving him time to raise the shades, the latter said:\n\n\"So you are going to marry Suzanne Walter?\"\n\nHe replied in the affirmative, adding gently: \"Did you not know it?\"\n\nShe answered angrily: \"So you are going to marry Suzanne Walter? For\nthree months you have deceived me. Everyone knew of it but me. My\nhusband told me. Since you left your wife you have been preparing for\nthat stroke, and you made use of me in the interim. What a rascal you\nare!\"\n\nHe asked: \"How do you make that out? I had a wife who deceived me; I\nsurprised her, obtained a divorce, and am now going to marry another.\nWhat is more simple than that?\"\n\nShe murmured: \"What a villain!\"\n\nHe said with dignity: \"I beg of you to be more careful as to what you\nsay.\"\n\nShe rebelled at such words from him: \"What! Would you like me to handle\nyou with gloves? You have conducted yourself like a rascal ever since I\nhave known you, and now you do not want me to speak of it. You deceive\neveryone; you gather pleasure and money everywhere, and you want me to\ntreat you as an honest man.\"\n\nHe rose; his lips twitched: \"Be silent or I will make you leave these\nrooms.\"\n\nShe cried: \"Leave here--you will make me--you? You forget that it is I\nwho have paid for these apartments from the very first, and you\nthreaten to put me out of them. Be silent, good-for-nothing! Do you\nthink I do not know how you stole a portion of Vaudrec's bequest from\nMadeleine? Do you think I do not know about Suzanne?\"\n\nHe seized her by her shoulders and shook her. \"Do not speak of that; I\nforbid you.\"\n\n\"I know you have ruined her!\"\n\nHe would have taken anything else, but that lie exasperated him. He\nrepeated: \"Be silent--take care\"--and he shook her as he would have\nshaken the bough of a tree. Still she continued; \"You were her ruin, I\nknow it.\" He rushed upon her and struck her as if she had been a man.\nSuddenly she ceased speaking, and groaned beneath his blows. Finally he\ndesisted, paced the room several times in order to regain his\nself-possession, entered the bedroom, filled the basin with cold water\nand bathed his head. Then he washed his hands and returned to see what\nClotilde was doing. She had not moved. She lay upon the floor weeping\nsoftly. He asked harshly:\n\n\"Will you soon have done crying?\"\n\nShe did not reply. He stood in the center of the room, somewhat\nembarrassed, somewhat ashamed, as he saw the form lying before him.\nSuddenly he seized his hat. \"Good evening. You can leave the key with\nthe janitor when you are ready. I will not await your pleasure.\"\n\nHe left the room, closed the door, sought the porter, and said to him:\n\"Madame is resting. She will go out soon. You can tell the proprietor\nthat I have given notice for the first of October.\"\n\nHis marriage was fixed for the twentieth; it was to take place at the\nMadeleine. There had been a great deal of gossip about the entire\naffair, and many different reports were circulated. Mme. Walter had\naged greatly; her hair was gray and she sought solace in religion.\n\nIn the early part of September \"La Vie Francaise\" announced that Baron\ndu Roy de Cantel had become its chief editor, M. Walter reserving the\ntitle of manager. To that announcement were subjoined the names of the\nstaff of art and theatrical critics, political reporters, and so forth.\nJournalists no longer sneered in speaking of \"La Vie Francaise;\" its\nsuccess had been rapid and complete. The marriage of its chief editor\nwas what was called a \"Parisian event,\" Georges du Roy and the Walters\nhaving occasioned much comment for some time.\n\nThe ceremony took place on a clear, autumn day. At ten o'clock the\ncurious began to assemble; at eleven o'clock, detachments of officers\ncame to disperse the crowd. Soon after, the first guests arrived; they\nwere followed by others, women in rich costumes, men, grave and\ndignified. The church slowly began to fill. Norbert de Varenne espied\nJacques Rival, and joined him.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"sharpers always succeed.\"\n\nHis companion, who was not envious, replied: \"So much the better for\nhim. His fortune is made.\"\n\nRival asked: \"Do you know what has become of his wife?\"\n\nThe poet smiled. \"Yes and no--she lives a very retired life, I have\nbeen told, in the Montmartre quarter. But--there is a but--for some\ntime I have read political articles in 'La Plume,' which resemble those\nof Forestier and Du Roy. They are supposed to be written by a Jean Le\nDol, a young, intelligent, handsome man--something like our friend\nGeorges--who has become acquainted with Mme. Forestier. From that I\nhave concluded that she likes beginners and that they like her. She is,\nmoreover, rich; Vaudrec and Laroche-Mathieu were not attentive to her\nfor nothing.\"\n\nRival asked: \"Tell me, is it true that Mme. Walter and Du Roy do not\nspeak?\"\n\n\"Yes. She did not wish to give him her daughter's hand. But he\nthreatened the old man with shocking revelations. Walter remembered\nLaroche-Mathieu's fate and yielded at once; but his wife, obstinate\nlike all women, vowed that she would never address a word to her\nson-in-law. It is comical to see them together! She looks like the\nstatue of vengeance, and he is very uncomfortable, although he tries to\nappear at his ease.\"\n\nSuddenly the beadle struck the floor three times with his staff. All\nthe people turned to see what was coming, and the young bride appeared\nin the doorway leaning upon her father's arm. She looked like a\nbeautiful doll, crowned with a wreath of orange blossoms. She advanced\nwith bowed head. The ladies smiled and murmured as she passed them. The\nmen whispered:\n\n\"Exquisite, adorable!\"\n\nM. Walter walked by her side with exaggerated dignity. Behind them came\nfour maids of honor dressed in pink and forming a charming court for so\ndainty a queen.\n\nMme. Walter followed on the arm of Count de Latour-Ivelin's aged\nfather. She did not walk; she dragged herself along, ready to faint at\nevery step. She had aged and grown thinner.\n\nNext came Georges du Roy with an old lady, a stranger. He held his head\nproudly erect and wore upon his coat, like a drop of blood, the red\nribbon of the Legion of Honor.\n\nHe was followed by the relatives: Rose, who had been married six weeks,\nwith a senator; Count de Latour-Ivelin with Viscountess de Percemur.\nFollowing them was a motley procession of associates and friends of Du\nRoy, country cousins of Mme. Walter's, and guests invited by her\nhusband.\n\nThe tones of the organ filled the church; the large doors at the\nentrance were closed, and Georges kneeled beside his bride in the\nchoir. The new bishop of Tangiers, cross in hand, miter on head,\nentered from the sacristy, to unite them in the name of the Almighty.\nHe asked the usual questions, rings were exchanged, words pronounced\nwhich bound them forever, and then he delivered an address to the newly\nmarried couple.\n\nThe sound of stifled sobs caused several to turn their heads. Mme.\nWalter was weeping, her face buried in her hands. She had been obliged\nto yield; but since the day on which she had told Du Roy: \"You are the\nvilest man I know; never speak to me again, for I will not answer you,\"\nshe had suffered intolerable anguish. She hated Suzanne bitterly; her\nhatred was caused by unnatural jealousy. The bishop was marrying a\ndaughter to her mother's lover, before her and two thousand persons,\nand she could say nothing; she could not stop him. She could not cry:\n\"He is mine, that man is my lover. That union you are blessing is\ninfamous.\"\n\nSeveral ladies, touched by her apparent grief, murmured: \"How affected\nthat poor mother is!\"\n\nThe bishop said: \"You are among the favored ones of the earth. You,\nsir, who are raised above others by your talent--you who write,\ninstruct, counsel, guide the people, have a grand mission to fulfill--a\nfine example to set.\"\n\nDu Roy listened to him proudly. A prelate of the Roman Church spoke\nthus to him. A number of illustrious people had come thither on his\naccount. It seemed to him that an invisible power was impelling him on.\nHe would become one of the masters of the country--he, the son of the\npoor peasants of Canteleu. He had given his parents five thousand\nfrancs of Count de Vaudrec's fortune and he intended sending them fifty\nthousand more; then they could buy a small estate and live happily.\n\nThe bishop had finished his harangue, a priest ascended the altar, and\nthe organ pealed forth. Suddenly the vibrating tones melted into\ndelicate, melodious ones, like the songs of birds; then again they\nswelled into deep, full tones and human voices chanted over their bowed\nheads. Vauri and Landeck of the Opera were singing.\n\nBel-Ami, kneeling beside Suzanne, bowed his head. At that moment he\nfelt almost pious, for he was filled with gratitude for the blessings\nshowered upon him. Without knowing just whom he was addressing, he\noffered up thanks for his success. When the ceremony was over, he rose,\nand, giving his arm to his wife, they passed into the sacristy. A\nstream of people entered. Georges fancied himself a king whom the\npeople were coming to greet. He shook hands, uttered words which\nsignified nothing, and replied to congratulations with the words: \"You\nare very kind.\"\n\nSuddenly he saw Mme. de Marelle, and the recollection of all the kisses\nhe had given her and which she had returned, of all their caresses, of\nthe sound of her voice, possessed him with the mad desire to regain\nher. She was so pretty, with her bright eyes and roguish air! She\nadvanced somewhat timidly and offered him her hand. He took, retained,\nand pressed it as if to say: \"I shall love you always, I am yours.\"\n\nTheir eyes met, smiling, bright, full of love. She murmured in her soft\ntones: \"Until we meet again, sir!\" and he gaily repeated her words.\n\nOthers approached, and she passed on. Finally the throng dispersed.\nGeorges placed Suzanne's hand upon his arm to pass through the church\nwith her. It was filled with people, for all had resumed their seats in\norder to see them leave the sacred edifice together. He walked along\nslowly, with a firm step, his head erect. He saw no one. He only\nthought of himself.\n\nWhen they reached the threshold he saw a crowd gathered outside, come\nto gaze at him, Georges du Roy. The people of Paris envied him. Raising\nhis eyes, he saw beyond the Place de la Concorde, the chamber of\ndeputies, and it seemed to him that it was only a stone's throw from\nthe portico of the Madeleine to that of the Palais Bourbon.\n\nLeisurely they descended the steps between two rows of spectators, but\nGeorges did not see them; his thoughts had returned to the past, and\nbefore his eyes, dazzled by the bright sunlight, floated the image of\nMme. de Marelle, rearranging the curly locks upon her temples before\nthe mirror in their apartments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Bel Ami, by Henri Rene Guy de Maupassant\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BEL AMI ***\n\n***** This file should be named 3733.txt or 3733.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/3\/7\/3\/3733\/\n\nProduced by Charles Franks and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":357,"split":"train"}
