{"ori_id":"5b47447fc2a6ec696cd2b6d3de7473d715b75223","title":"The Bourne Identity (novel)","context":"The Bourne Identity (novel)\n The preface of the novel consists of two real-life newspaper articles from 1975 about terrorist Ilich Ram\u00edrez S\u00e1nchez, known as \"Carlos the Jackal.\"\nThe story opens with gunfire on a boat in the Mediterranean Sea. One man is cast into the waves before the boat explodes, and is later picked up by fishermen, who find him clinging to debris. They also find he is suffering from amnesia, apparently as a result of a traumatic head injury, with occasional erratic intrusions or flashbacks to the past, but is unable to make sense of them. The only definite evidence of his former life is a small film negative found embedded in his hip containing the information required to access a bank account in Zurich.\nWhen he goes to Zurich to gain access to the bank, a clerk recognizes him. From this the man concludes that his name is \"Jason Charles Bourne\", that he has relations with a firm called Treadstone Seventy-One Corporation, and that his account holds 7,500,000 Swiss francs (equivalent to $5,000,000 in the novel). Circumstantial evidence leads Bourne to suspect that he should go to Paris, so he wires most of the money there. At the bank and his hotel, men suddenly try to kill Bourne, so he quickly takes another hotel guest, Canadian government economist Marie St. Jacques, as a hostage in order to escape. After escaping from Bourne, St. Jacques reports his whereabouts to men she thinks are police, but they turn out to be Bourne's pursuers and professional killers who try to rape and kill her. When Bourne rescues her at the risk of his own life, St. Jacques decides to help him.\nThey head to Paris to find clues about Bourne's past. Once in Paris, Bourne learns that his attackers' leader may be \"Carlos,\" who is described as the most dangerous terrorist of his time, responsible for numerous killings in many countries and well connected in the highest government circles. For reasons only partly comprehensible to himself, Bourne develops a compulsion to hunt Carlos. As the story develops, Bourne follows clues that bring him closer to Carlos, leading him to places such as a designer clothing store used as relay for Carlos. Though Bourne twice briefly sees Carlos, he does not manage to catch or kill him. To his distress, Bourne also finds mounting evidence that he himself is a rival assassin called \u2033Cain.\u2033 Meanwhile, he and St. Jacques are falling in love.\nIt turns out that Cain is an alias that had been assumed by Bourne\u2014whose real name is not even \"Bourne\"\u2014to hunt down Carlos; Cain took credit for kills as a way of challenging Carlos as part of a top-secret American plot. The plot is called Treadstone Seventy-One, and the truth is known only to eight men selected by covert agencies of the U.S. government; everyone else assumes Cain to be a real person. Due to Bourne's six-month silence (while he was recuperating) and the unauthorized diversion of millions of dollars from the Zurich account, the Treadstone men start to believe that Bourne has become a traitor. They are entirely convinced of his guilt when one of Carlos' operatives storms the building in which Treadstone is based, kills those inside, and then frames Bourne for the murders. The man now responsible for Treadstone attempts to lure Bourne into a meeting outside of Paris to kill him. Bourne escapes the trap, but does not succeed in proving his innocence.\nIn Paris, Bourne has managed to convince a French General named Villiers to help him. Bourne realizes that Villiers' wife is a mole for Carlos. When the General hears about it, he finally kills his wife and Bourne takes the blame in order to bait Carlos into following him to the United States. Only after Bourne has left do St. Jacques and Villiers manage to convince Treadstone members that Bourne is innocent, and is continuing to hunt Carlos. In New York, Bourne is confronted by Carlos. They wound each other, but when Carlos is on the verge of killing Bourne, some of the remaining Treadstone members arrive at the scene and force Carlos to retreat.\nThe epilogue sees St. Jacques being told about Bourne's past, most of which had been revealed in fragments already: He had been an American Foreign Service officer stationed in Asia during the Vietnam War. When his wife and two children were killed, he joined a paramilitary unit in Vietnam. During one mission, he discovered and executed the double agent Jason Bourne. He took the name years later when he was recruited for Treadstone.\nAt the novel's end, it is revealed that \"Bourne\" has recovered from the encounter with Carlos and probably lives together with St. Jacques. He remains the only one to ever have seen the face of Carlos and may be able to recognize him as a public figure, but is unable to do so due to his erratic memory. As a consequence, he is protected day and night by armed watchmen, in the hope he will one day recover enough to identify Carlos. The plot closes with him remembering his first name.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, From Whose Bourne, by Robert Barr\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

I am not feeling at all well.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Do you think I shall be missed?\"]\n\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry, Will,\" replied Alice, looking concerned; \"I will tell\nthem you are indisposed.\"\n\n\"No, don't do that,\" was the answer; \"they are having a very good time,\nand I suppose the dancing will begin shortly; so I don't think they will\nmiss me. If I feel better I will be down in an hour or two; if not, I\nshall go to bed. Now, dear, don't worry; but have a good time with the\nrest of them.\"\n\nWilliam Brenton went quietly upstairs to his room, and sat down in the\ndarkness in a rocking chair. Remaining there a few minutes, and not\nfeeling any better, he slowly undressed and went to bed. Faint echoes\nreached him of laughter and song; finally, music began, and he felt,\nrather than heard, the pulsation of dancing feet. Once, when the music\nhad ceased for a time, Alice tiptoed into the room, and said in a quiet\nvoice--\n\n\"How are you feeling, Will? any better?\"\n\n\"A little,\" he answered drowsily. \"Don't worry about me; I shall drop\noff to sleep presently, and shall be all right in the morning. Good\nnight.\"\n\nHe still heard in a dreamy sort of way the music, the dancing, the\nlaughter; and gradually there came oblivion, which finally merged into\na dream, the most strange and vivid vision he had ever experienced.\nIt seemed to him that he sat again in the rocking chair near the bed.\nAlthough he knew the room was dark, he had no difficulty in seeing\neverything perfectly. He heard, now quite plainly, the music and dancing\ndownstairs, but what gave a ghastly significance to his dream was the\nsight of his own person on the bed. The eyes were half open, and the\nface was drawn and rigid. The colour of the face was the white, greyish\ntint of death.\n\n\"This is a nightmare,\" said Brenton to himself; \"I must try and wake\nmyself.\" But he seemed powerless to do this, and he sat there looking at\nhis own body while the night wore on. Once he rose and went to the side\nof the bed. He seemed to have reached it merely by wishing himself\nthere, and he passed his hand over the face, but no feeling of touch was\ncommunicated to him. He hoped his wife would come and rouse him from\nthis fearful semblance of a dream, and, wishing this, he found himself\nstanding at her side, amidst the throng downstairs, who were now merrily\nsaying good-bye. Brenton tried to speak to his wife, but although he\nwas conscious of speaking, she did not seem to hear him, or know he was\nthere.\n\n[Illustration: He again sat in the rocking-chair.]\n\nThe party had been one given on Christmas Eve, and as it was now two\no'clock in the morning, the departing guests were wishing Mrs. Brenton a\nmerry Christmas. Finally, the door closed on the last of the revellers,\nand Mrs. Brenton stood for a moment giving instructions to the sleepy\nservants; then, with a tired sigh, she turned and went upstairs, Brenton\nwalking by her side until they came to the darkened room, which she\nentered on tiptoe.\n\n\"Now,\" said Brenton to himself, \"she will arouse me from this appalling\ndream.\" It was not that there was anything dreadful in the dream itself,\nbut the clearness with which he saw everything, and the fact that his\nmind was perfectly wide awake, gave him an uneasiness which he found\nimpossible to shake off.\n\nIn the dim light from the hall his wife prepared to retire. The horrible\nthought struck Brenton that she imagined he was sleeping soundly,\nand was anxious not to awaken him--for of course she could have no\nrealization of the nightmare he was in--so once again he tried to\ncommunicate with her. He spoke her name over and over again, but she\nproceeded quietly with her preparations for the night. At last she crept\nin at the other side of the bed, and in a few moments was asleep. Once\nmore Brenton struggled to awake, but with no effect. He heard the clock\nstrike three, and then four, and then five, but there was no apparent\nchange in his dream. He feared that he might be in a trance, from which,\nperhaps, he would not awake until it was too late. Grey daylight began\nto brighten the window, and he noticed that snow was quietly falling\noutside, the flakes noiselessly beating against the window pane. Every\none slept late that morning, but at last he heard the preparations for\nbreakfast going on downstairs--the light clatter of china on the table,\nthe rattle of the grate; and, as he thought of these things, he found\nhimself in the dining-room, and saw the trim little maid, who still\nyawned every now and then, laying the plates in their places. He went\nupstairs again, and stood watching the sleeping face of his wife. Once\nshe raised her hand above her head, and he thought she was going to\nawake; ultimately her eyes opened, and she gazed for a time at the\nceiling, seemingly trying to recollect the events of the day before.\n\n\"Will,\" she said dreamily, \"are you still asleep?\"\n\nThere was no answer from the rigid figure at the front of the bed. After\na few moments she placed her hand quietly over the sleeper's face. As\nshe did so, her startled eyes showed that she had received a shock.\nInstantly she sat upright in bed, and looked for one brief second on the\nface of the sleeper beside her; then, with a shriek that pierced the\nstillness of the room, she sprang to the floor.\n\n\"Will! Will!\" she cried, \"speak to me! What is the matter with you? Oh,\nmy God! my God!\" she cried, staggering back from the bed. Then, with\nshriek after shriek, she ran blindly through the hall to the stairway,\nand there fell fainting on the floor.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nWilliam Brenton knelt beside the fallen lady, and tried to soothe and\ncomfort her, but it was evident that she was insensible.\n\n\"It is useless,\" said a voice by his side.\n\nBrenton looked up suddenly, and saw standing beside him a stranger.\nWondering for a moment how he got there, and thinking that after all it\nwas a dream, he said--\n\n\"What is useless? She is not dead.\"\n\n\"No,\" answered the stranger, \"but _you_ are.\"\n\n[Illustration: He saw standing beside him a stranger.]\n\n\"I am what?\" cried Brenton.\n\n\"You are what the material world calls dead, although in reality you\nhave just begun to live.\"\n\n\"And who are you?\" asked Brenton. \"And how did you get in here?\"\n\nThe other smiled.\n\n\"How did _you_ get in here?\" he said, repeating Brenton's words.\n\n\"I? Why, this is my own house.\"\n\n\"Was, you mean.\"\n\n\"I mean that it is. I am in my own house. This lady is my wife.\"\n\n\"_Was_,\" said the other.\n\n\"I do not understand you,\" cried Brenton, very much annoyed. \"But, in\nany case, your presence and your remarks are out of place here.\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said the other, \"I merely wish to aid you and to explain\nto you anything that you may desire to know about your new condition.\nYou are now free from the incumbrance of your body. You have already had\nsome experience of the additional powers which that riddance has given\nyou. You have also, I am afraid, had an inkling of the fact that the\nspiritual condition has its limitations. If you desire to communicate\nwith those whom you have left, I would strongly advise you to postpone\nthe attempt, and to leave this place, where you will experience only\npain and anxiety. Come with me, and learn something of your changed\ncircumstances.\"\n\n\"I am in a dream,\" said Brenton, \"and you are part of it. I went to\nsleep last night, and am still dreaming. This is a nightmare and it will\nsoon be over.\"\n\n\"You are saying that,\" said the other, \"merely to convince yourself.\nIt is now becoming apparent to you that this is not a dream. If dreams\nexist, it was a dream which you left, but you have now become awake. If\nyou really think it is a dream, then do as I tell you--come with me and\nleave it, because you must admit that this part of the dream is at least\nvery unpleasant.\"\n\n\"It is not very pleasant,\" assented Brenton. As he spoke the bewildered\nservants came rushing up the stairs, picked up their fallen mistress,\nand laid her on a sofa. They rubbed her hands and dashed water in her\nface. She opened her eyes, and then closed them again with a shudder.\n\n\"Sarah,\" she cried, \"have I been dreaming, or is your master dead?\"\n\nThe two girls turned pale at this, and the elder of them went boldly\ninto the room which her mistress had just left. She was evidently\na young woman who had herself under good control, but she came out\nsobbing, with her apron to her eyes.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said the man who stood beside Brenton, \"haven't you had\nenough of this? Come with me; you can return to this house if you wish;\"\nand together they passed out of the room into the crisp air of Christmas\nmorning. But, although Brenton knew it must be cold, he had no feeling\nof either cold or warmth.\n\n\"There are a number of us,\" said the stranger to Brenton, \"who take\nturns at watching the sick-bed when a man is about to die, and when his\nspirit leaves his body, we are there to explain, or comfort, or console.\nYour death was so sudden that we had no warning of it. You did not feel\nill before last night, did you?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Brenton. \"I felt perfectly well, until after dinner last\nnight.\"\n\n\"Did you leave your affairs in reasonably good order?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Brenton, trying to recollect. \"I think they will find\neverything perfectly straight.\"\n\n\"Tell me a little of your history, if you do not mind,\" inquired the\nother; \"it will help me in trying to initiate you into our new order of\nthings here.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Brenton, and he wondered at himself for falling so\neasily into the other's assumption that he was a dead man, \"I was what\nthey call on the earth in reasonably good circumstances. My estate\nshould be worth $100,000. I had $75,000 insurance on my life, and if all\nthat is paid, it should net my widow not far from a couple of hundred\nthousand.\"\n\n\"How long have you been married?\" said the other.\n\n[Illustration: A Venetian caf\u00c3\u00a9.]\n\n\"Only about six months. I was married last July, and we went for a trip\nabroad. We were married quietly, and left almost immediately afterwards,\nso we thought, on our return, it would not be a bad plan to give a\nChristmas Eve dinner, and invite some of our friends. That,\" he said,\nhesitating a moment, \"was last night. Shortly after dinner, I began to\nfeel rather ill, and went upstairs to rest for a while; and if what you\nsay is true, the first thing I knew I found myself dead.\"\n\n\"Alive,\" corrected the other.\n\n\"Well, alive, though at present I feel I belong more to the world I have\nleft than I do to the world I appear to be in. I must confess, although\nyou are a very plausible gentleman to talk to, that I expect at any\nmoment to wake and find this to have been one of the most horrible\nnightmares that I ever had the ill luck to encounter.\"\n\nThe other smiled.\n\n\"There is very little danger of your waking up, as you call it. Now, I\nwill tell you the great trouble we have with people when they first come\nto the spirit-land, and that is to induce them to forget entirely\nthe world they have relinquished. Men whose families are in poor\ncircumstances, or men whose affairs are in a disordered state, find it\nvery difficult to keep from trying to set things right again. They have\nthe feeling that they can console or comfort those whom they have left\nbehind them, and it is often a long time before they are convinced that\ntheir efforts are entirely futile, as well as very distressing for\nthemselves.\"\n\n\"Is there, then,\" asked Brenton, \"no communication between this world\nand the one that I have given up?\"\n\nThe other paused for a moment before he replied.\n\n\"I should hardly like to say,\" he answered, \"that there is _no_\ncommunication between one world and the other; but the communication\nthat exists is so slight and unsatisfactory, that if you are sensible\nyou will see things with the eyes of those who have very much more\nexperience in this world than you have. Of course, you can go back there\nas much as you like; there will be no interference and no hindrance.\nBut when you see things going wrong, when you see a mistake about to\nbe made, it is an appalling thing to stand there helpless, unable to\ninfluence those you love, or to point out a palpable error, and convince\nthem that your clearer sight sees it as such. Of course, I understand\nthat it must be very difficult for a man who is newly married, to\nentirely abandon the one who has loved him, and whom he loves. But\nI assure you that if you follow the life of one who is as young and\nhandsome as your wife, you will find some one else supplying the\nconsolations you are unable to bestow. Such a mission may lead you to a\nchurch where she is married to her second husband. I regret to say that\neven the most imperturbable spirits are ruffled when such an incident\noccurs. The wise men are those who appreciate and understand that they\nare in an entirely new world, with new powers and new limitations, and\nwho govern themselves accordingly from the first, as they will certainly\ndo later on.\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Brenton, somewhat offended, \"if what you say is\ntrue, and I am really a dead man----\"\n\n\"Alive,\" corrected the other.\n\n\"Well, alive, then. I may tell you that my wife's heart is broken. She\nwill never marry again.\"\n\n\"Of course, that is a subject of which you know a great deal more than I\ndo. I all the more strongly advise you never to see her again. It is\nimpossible for you to offer any consolation, and the sight of her grief\nand misery will only result in unhappiness for yourself. Therefore, take\nmy advice. I have given it very often, and I assure you those who did\nnot take it expressed their regret afterwards. Hold entirely aloof from\nanything relating to your former life.\"\n\nBrenton was silent for some moments; finally he said--\n\n\"I presume your advice is well meant; but if things are as you state,\nthen I may as well say, first as last, that I do not intend to accept\nit.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the other; \"it is an experience that many prefer to go\nthrough for themselves.\"\n\n\"Do you have names in this spirit-land?\" asked Brenton, seemingly\ndesirous of changing the subject.\n\n\"Yes,\" was the answer; \"we are known by names that we have used in the\npreparatory school below. My name is Ferris.\"\n\n\"And if I wish to find you here, how do I set about it?\"\n\n\"The wish is sufficient,\" answered Ferris. \"Merely wish to be with me,\nand you _are_ with me.\"\n\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Brenton, \"is locomotion so easy as that?\"\n\n\"Locomotion is very easy. I do not think anything could be easier\nthan it is, and I do not think there could be any improvement in that\nmatter.\"\n\n\"Are there matters here, then, that you think could be improved?\"\n\n\"As to that I shall not say. Perhaps you will be able to give your own\nopinion before you have lived here much longer.\"\n\n\"Taking it all in all,\" said Brenton, \"do you think the spirit-land is\nto be preferred to the one we have left?\"\n\n\"I like it better,\" said Ferris, \"although I presume there are some\nwho do not. There are many advantages; and then, again, there are\nmany--well, I would not say disadvantages, but still some people\nconsider them such. We are free from the pangs of hunger or cold, and\nhave therefore no need of money, and there is no necessity for the rush\nand the worry of the world below.\"\n\n\"And how about heaven and hell?\" said Brenton. \"Are those localities all\na myth? Is there nothing of punishment and nothing of reward in this\nspirit-land?\"\n\nThere was no answer to this, and when Brenton looked around he found\nthat his companion had departed.\n\n[Illustration: Venice.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nWilliam Brenton pondered long on the situation. He would have known\nbetter how to act if he could have been perfectly certain that he was\nnot still the victim of a dream. However, of one thing there was no\ndoubt--namely, that it was particularly harrowing to see what he had\nseen in his own house. If it were true that he was dead, he said to\nhimself, was not the plan outlined for him by Ferris very much the wiser\ncourse to adopt? He stood now in one of the streets of the city so\nfamiliar to him. People passed and repassed him--men and women whom\nhe had known in life--but nobody appeared to see him. He resolved, if\npossible, to solve the problem uppermost in his mind, and learn whether\nor not he could communicate with an inhabitant of the world he had left.\nHe paused for a moment to consider the best method of doing this. Then\nhe remembered one of his most confidential friends and advisers, and at\nonce wished himself at his office. He found the office closed, but went\nin to wait for his friend. Occupying the time in thinking over his\nstrange situation, he waited long, and only when the bells began to ring\ndid he remember it was Christmas forenoon, and that his friend would\nnot be at the office that day. The next moment he wished himself at his\nfriend's house, but he was as unsuccessful as at the office; the friend\nwas not at home. The household, however, was in great commotion, and,\nlistening to what was said, he found that the subject of conversation\nwas his own death, and he learned that his friend had gone to the\nBrenton residence as soon as he heard the startling news of Christmas\nmorning.\n\nOnce more Brenton paused, and did not know what to do. He went again\ninto the street. Everything seemed to lead him toward his own home.\nAlthough he had told Ferris that he did not intend to take his advice,\nyet as a sensible man he saw that the admonition was well worth\nconsidering, and if he could once become convinced that there was no\ncommunication possible between himself and those he had left; if he\ncould give them no comfort and no cheer; if he could see the things\nwhich they did not see, and yet be unable to give them warning, he\nrealized that he would merely be adding to his own misery, without\nalleviating the troubles of others.\n\nHe wished he knew where to find Ferris, so that he might have another\ntalk with him. The man impressed him as being exceedingly sensible. No\nsooner, however, had he wished for the company of Mr. Ferris than he\nfound himself beside that gentleman.\n\n\"By George!\" he said in astonishment, \"you are just the man I wanted to\nsee.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Ferris; \"that is the reason you do see me.\"\n\n\"I have been thinking over what you said,\" continued the other, \"and it\nstrikes me that after all your advice is sensible.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" replied Ferris, with something like a smile on his face.\n\n\"But there is one thing I want to be perfectly certain about. I want to\nknow whether it is not possible for me to communicate with my friends.\nNothing will settle that doubt in my mind except actual experience.\"\n\n\"And have you not had experience enough?\" asked Ferris.\n\n\"Well,\" replied the other, hesitating, \"I have had some experience, but\nit seems to me that, if I encounter an old friend, I could somehow make\nmyself felt by him.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" answered Ferris, \"if nothing will convince you but an\nactual experiment, why don't you go to some of your old friends and try\nwhat you can do with them?\"\n\n\"I have just been to the office and to the residence of one of my old\nfriends. I found at his residence that he had gone to my\"--Brenton\npaused for a moment--\"former home. Everything seems to lead me there,\nand yet, if I take your advice, I must avoid that place of all others.\"\n\n\"I would at present, if I were you,\" said Ferris. \"Still, why not try it\nwith any of the passers-by?\"\n\nBrenton looked around him. People were passing and repassing where the\ntwo stood talking with each other. \"Merry Christmas\" was the word on all\nlips. Finally Brenton said, with a look of uncertainty on his face--\n\n\"My dear fellow, I can't talk to any of these people. I don't know\nthem.\"\n\nFerris laughed at this, and replied--\n\n\"I don't think you will shock them very much; just try it.\"\n\n\"Ah, here's a friend of mine. You wait a moment, and I will accost him.\"\nApproaching him, Brenton held out his hand and spoke, but the traveller\npaid no attention. He passed by as one who had seen or heard nothing.\n\n\"I assure you,\" said Ferris, as he noticed the look of disappointment on\nthe other's face, \"you will meet with a similar experience, however much\nyou try. You know the old saying about one not being able to have his\ncake and eat it too. You can't have the privileges of this world and\nthose of the world you left as well. I think, taking it all in all, you\nshould rest content, although it always hurts those who have left the\nother world not to be able to communicate with their friends, and at\nleast assure them of their present welfare.\"\n\n\"It does seem to me,\" replied Brenton, \"that would be a great\nconsolation, both for those who are here and those who are left.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know about that,\" answered the other. \"After all, what\ndoes life in the other world amount to? It is merely a preparation for\nthis. It is of so short a space, as compared with the life we live here,\nthat it is hardly worth while to interfere with it one way or another.\nBy the time you are as long here as I have been, you will realize the\ntruth of this.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I shall,\" said Brenton, with a sigh; \"but, meanwhile, what am\nI to do with myself? I feel like the man who has been all his life\nin active business, and who suddenly resolves to enjoy himself doing\nnothing. That sort of thing seems to kill a great number of men,\nespecially if they put off taking a rest until too late, as most of us\ndo.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Ferris, \"there is no necessity of your being idle here, I\nassure you. But before you lay out any work for yourself, let me ask you\nif there is not some interesting part of the world that you would like\nto visit?\"\n\n\"Certainly; I have seen very little of the world. That is one of my\nregrets at leaving it.\"\n\n\"Bless me,\" said the other, \"you haven't left it.\"\n\n\"Why, I thought you said I was a dead man?\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" replied his companion, \"I have several times insisted\nthat you have just begun to live. Now where shall we spend the day?\"\n\n\"How would London do?\"\n\n\"I don't think it would do; London is apt to be a little gloomy at this\ntime of the year. But what do you say to Naples, or Japan, or, if you\ndon't wish to go out of the United States, Yellowstone Park?\"\n\n\"Can we reach any of those places before the day is over?\" asked\nBrenton, dubiously.\n\n\"Well, I will soon show you how we manage all that. Just wish to\naccompany me, and I will take you the rest of the way.\"\n\n\"How would Venice do?\" said Brenton. \"I didn't see half as much of that\ncity as I wanted to.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied his companion, \"Venice it is;\" and the American\ncity in which they stood faded away from them, and before Brenton could\nmake up his mind exactly what was happening, he found himself walking\nwith his comrade in St. Mark's Square.\n\n\"Well, for rapid transit,\" said Brenton, \"this beats anything I've ever\nhad any idea of; but it increases the feeling that I am in a dream.\"\n\n\"You'll soon get used to it,\" answered Ferris; \"and, when you do, the\ncumbersome methods of travel in the world itself will show themselves in\ntheir right light. Hello!\" he cried, \"here's a man whom I should\nlike you to meet. By the way, I either don't know your name or I have\nforgotten it.\"\n\n\"William Brenton,\" answered the other.\n\n\"Mr. Speed, I want to introduce you to Mr. Brenton.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Speed, cordially, \"a new-comer. One of your victims, Ferris?\"\n\n\"Say one of his pupils, rather,\" answered Brenton.\n\n[Illustration: In Venice.]\n\n\"Well, it is pretty much the same thing,\" said Speed. \"How long have you\nbeen with us, and how do you like the country?\"\n\n\"You see, Mr. Brenton,\" interrupted Ferris, \"John Speed was a newspaper\nman, and he must ask strangers how they like the country. He has\ninquired so often while interviewing foreigners for his paper that now\nhe cannot abandon his old phrase. Mr. Brenton has been with us but a\nshort time,\" continued Ferris, \"and so you know, Speed, you can hardly\nexpect him to answer your inevitable question.\"\n\n\"What part of the country are you from?\" asked Speed.\n\n\"Cincinnati,\" answered Brenton, feeling almost as if he were an American\ntourist doing the continent of Europe.\n\n\"Cincinnati, eh? Well, I congratulate you. I do not know any place in\nAmerica that I would sooner die in, as they call it, than Cincinnati.\nYou see, I am a Chicago man myself.\"\n\nBrenton did not like the jocular familiarity of the newspaper man, and\nfound himself rather astonished to learn that in the spirit-world there\nwere likes and dislikes, just as on earth.\n\n\"Chicago is a very enterprising city,\" he said, in a non-committal way.\n\n\"Chicago, my dear sir,\" said Speed, earnestly, \"is _the_ city. You will\nsee that Chicago is going to be the great city of the world before you\nare a hundred years older. By the way, Ferris,\" said the Chicago man,\nsuddenly recollecting something, \"I have got Sommers over here with me.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Ferris; \"doing him any good?\"\n\n\"Well, precious little, as far as I can see.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it would interest Mr. Brenton to meet him,\" said Ferris. \"I\nthink, Brenton, you asked me a while ago if there was any hell here, or\nany punishment. Mr. Speed can show you a man in hell.\"\n\n\"Really?\" asked Brenton.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Speed; \"I think if ever a man was in misery, he is. The\ntrouble with Sommers was this. He--well, he died of delirium tremens,\nand so, of course, you know what the matter was. Sommers had drunk\nChicago whisky for thirty-five years straight along, and never added to\nit the additional horror of Chicago water. You see what his condition\nbecame, both physical and mental. Many people tried to reform Sommers,\nbecause he was really a brilliant man; but it was no use. Thirst had\nbecome a disease with him, and from the mental part of that disease,\nalthough his physical yearning is now gone of course, he suffers.\nSommers would give his whole future for one glass of good old Kentucky\nwhisky. He sees it on the counters, he sees men drink it, and he stands\nbeside them in agony. That's why I brought him over here. I thought that\nhe wouldn't see the colour of whisky as it sparkles in the glass; but\nnow he is in the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Quadra watching men drink. You may see him sitting\nthere with all the agony of unsatisfied desire gleaming from his face.\"\n\n\"And what do you do with a man like that?\" asked Brenton.\n\n\"Do? Well, to tell the truth, there is nothing _to_ do. I took him away\nfrom Chicago, hoping to ease his trouble a little; but it has had no\neffect.\"\n\n\"It will come out all right by-and-by,\" said Ferris, who noticed the\npained look on Brenton's face. \"It is the period of probation that\nhe has to pass through. It will wear off. He merely goes through the\nagonies he would have suffered on earth if he had suddenly been deprived\nof his favourite intoxicant.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Speed, \"you won't come with me, then? All right, good-bye.\nI hope to see you again, Mr. Brenton,\" and with that they separated.\n\nBrenton spent two or three days in Venice, but all the time the old home\nhunger was upon him. He yearned for news of Cincinnati. He wanted to be\nback, and several times the wish brought him there, but he instantly\nreturned. At last he said to Ferris--\n\n\"I am tired. I must go home. I have _got_ to see how things are going.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't if I were you,\" replied Ferris.\n\n\"No, I know you wouldn't. Your temperament is indifferent. I would\nrather be miserable with knowledge than happy in ignorance. Good-bye.\"\n\nIt was evening when he found himself in Cincinnati. The weather was\nbright and clear, and apparently cold. Men's feet crisped on the frozen\npavement, and the streets had that welcome, familiar look which they\nalways have to the returned traveller when he reaches the city he calls\nhis home. The newsboys were rushing through the streets yelling their\npapers at the top of their voices. He heard them, but paid little\nattention.\n\n\"All about the murder! Latest edition! All about the poison case!\"\n\nHe felt that he must have a glimpse at a paper, and, entering the office\nof an hotel where a man was reading one, he glanced over his shoulder\nat the page before him, and was horror-stricken to see the words in\nstartling headlines--\n\n                             THE BRENTON MURDER.\n            _The Autopsy shows that Morphine was the Poison used.\n                  Enough found to have killed a Dozen Men.\n               Mrs. Brenton arrested for Committing the Horrible\n                                    Deed_.\n\n[Illustration: The Brenton Murder.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nFor a moment Brenton was so bewildered and amazed at the awful headlines\nwhich he read, that he could hardly realize what had taken place.\nThe fact that he had been poisoned, although it gave him a strange\nsensation, did not claim his attention as much as might have been\nthought. Curiously enough he was more shocked at finding himself, as\nit were, the talk of the town, the central figure of a great newspaper\nsensation. But the thing that horrified him was the fact that his wife\nhad been arrested for his murder. His first impulse was to go to her at\nonce, but he next thought it better to read what the paper said about\nthe matter, so as to become possessed of all the facts. The headlines,\nhe said to himself, often exaggerated things, and there was a\npossibility that the body of the article would not bear out the naming\nannouncement above it. But as he read on and on, the situation seemed\nto become more and more appalling. He saw that his friends had been\nsuspicious of his sudden death, and had insisted on a post-mortem\nexamination. That examination had been conducted by three of the most\neminent physicians of Cincinnati, and the three doctors had practically\nagreed that the deceased, in the language of the verdict, had come to\nhis death through morphia poisoning, and the coroner's jury had brought\nin a verdict that \"the said William Brenton had been poisoned by some\nperson unknown.\" Then the article went on to state how suspicion had\ngradually fastened itself upon his wife, and at last her arrest had been\nordered. The arrest had taken place that day.\n\n[Illustration: Mrs. Brenton.]\n\nAfter reading this, Brenton was in an agony of mind. He pictured his\ndainty and beautiful wife in a stone cell in the city prison. He foresaw\nthe horrors of the public trial, and the deep grief and pain which\nthe newspaper comments on the case would cause to a woman educated and\nrefined. Of course, Brenton had not the slightest doubt in his own mind\nabout the result of the trial. His wife would be triumphantly acquitted;\nbut, all the same, the terrible suspense which she must suffer in the\nmeanwhile would not be compensated for by the final verdict of the jury.\n\nBrenton at once went to the jail, and wandered through that gloomy\nbuilding, searching for his wife. At last he found her, but it was in\na very comfortable room in the sheriffs residence. The terror and the\ntrials of the last few days had aged her perceptibly, and it cut Brenton\nto the heart to think that he stood there before her, and could not by\nany means say a soothing word that she would understand. That she had\nwept many bitter tears since the terrible Christmas morning was evident;\nthere were dark circles under her beautiful eyes that told of sleepless\nnights. She sat in a comfortable armchair, facing the window; and looked\nsteadily out at the dreary winter scene with eyes that apparently saw\nnothing. Her hands lay idly on her lap, and now and then she caught her\nbreath in a way that was half a sob and half a gasp.\n\nPresently the sheriff himself entered the room.\n\n\"Mrs. Brenton,\" he said, \"there is a gentleman here who wishes to see\nyou. Mr. Roland, he tells me his name is, an old friend of yours. Do you\ncare to see any one?\"\n\nThe lady turned her head slowly round, and looked at the sheriff for a\nmoment, seemingly not understanding what he said. Finally she answered,\ndreamily--\n\n\"Roland? Oh, Stephen! Yes, I shall be very glad to see him. Ask him to\ncome in, please.\"\n\nThe next moment Stephen Roland entered, and somehow the fact that he had\ncome to console Mrs. Brenton did not at all please the invisible man who\nstood between them.\n\n\"My dear Mrs. Brenton,\" began Roland, \"I hope you are feeling better\nto-day? Keep up your courage, and be brave. It is only for a very short\ntime. I have retained the noted criminal lawyers, Benham and Brown, for\nthe defence. You could not possibly have better men.\"\n\nAt the word \"criminal\" Mrs. Brenton shuddered.\n\n\"Alice,\" continued Roland, sitting down near her, and drawing his chair\ncloser to her, \"tell me that you will not lose your courage. I want you\nto be brave, for the sake of your friends.\"\n\nHe took her listless hand in his own, and she did not withdraw it.\n\nBrenton felt passing over him the pangs of impotent rage, as he saw this\nact on the part of Roland.\n\nRoland had been an unsuccessful suitor for the hand which he now held\nin his own, and Brenton thought it the worst possible taste, to say the\nleast, that he should take advantage now of her terrible situation to\ningratiate himself into her favour.\n\nThe nearest approach to a quarrel that Brenton and his wife had had\nduring their short six months of wedded life was on the subject of the\nman who now held her hand in his own. It made Brenton impatient to think\nthat a woman with all her boasted insight into character, her instincts\nas to what was right and what was wrong, had such little real intuition\nthat she did not see into the character of the man whom they were\ndiscussing; but a woman never thinks it a crime for a man to have been\nin love with her, whatever opinion of that man her husband may hold.\n\n\"It is awful! awful! awful!\" murmured the poor lady, as the tears again\nrose to her eyes.\n\n\"Of course it is,\" said Roland; \"it is particularly awful that they\nshould accuse you, of all persons in the world, of this so-called crime.\nFor my part I do not believe that he was poisoned at all, but we will\nsoon straighten things out. Benham and Brown will give up everything\nand devote their whole attention to this case until it is finished.\nEverything will be done that money or friends can do, and all that we\nask is that you keep up your courage, and do not be downcast with the\nseeming awfulness of the situation.\"\n\nMrs. Brenton wept silently, but made no reply. It was evident, however,\nthat she was consoled by the words and the presence of her visitor.\nStrange as it may appear, this fact enraged Brenton, although he had\ngone there for the very purpose of cheering and comforting his wife. All\nthe bitterness he had felt before against his former rival was revived,\nand his rage was the more agonizing because it was inarticulate. Then\nthere flashed over him Ferris's sinister advice to leave things alone in\nthe world that he had left. He felt that he could stand this no longer,\nand the next instant he found himself again in the wintry streets of\nCincinnati.\n\nThe name of the lawyers, Benham and Brown, kept repeating itself in his\nmind, and he resolved to go to their office and hear, if he could, what\npreparations were being made for the defence of a woman whom he knew to\nbe innocent. He found, when he got to the office of these noted lawyers,\nthat the two principals were locked in their private room; and going\nthere, he found them discussing the case with the coolness and\nimpersonal feeling that noted lawyers have even when speaking of issues\nthat involve life or death.\n\n\"Yes,\" Benham was saying, \"I think that, unless anything new turns up,\nthat is the best line of defence we can adopt.\"\n\n\"What do you think might turn up?\" asked Brown.\n\n\"Well, you can never tell in these cases. They may find something\nelse--they may find the poison, for instance, or the package that\ncontained it. Perhaps a druggist will remember having sold it to this\nwoman, and then, of course, we shall have to change our plans. I need\nnot say that it is strictly necessary in this case to give out no\nopinions whatever to newspaper men. The papers will be full of rumours,\nand it is just as well if we can keep our line of defence hidden until\nthe time for action comes.\"\n\n\"Still,\" said Brown, who was the younger partner, \"it is as well to keep\nin with the newspaper fellows; they'll be here as soon as they find we\nhave taken charge of the defence.\"\n\n\"Well, I have no doubt you can deal with them in such a way as to give\nthem something to write up, and yet not disclose anything we do not wish\nknown.\"\n\n\"I think you can trust me to do that,\" said Brown, with a self-satisfied\nair.\n\n\"I shall leave that part of the matter entirely in your hands,\" replied\nBenham. \"It is better not to duplicate or mix matters, and if any\nnewspaper man comes to see me I will refer him to you. I will say I know\nnothing of the case whatever.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" answered Brown. \"Now, between ourselves, what do you think\nof the case?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Oh, it will make a great sensation. I think it will probably be one of\nthe most talked-of cases that we have ever been connected with.\"\n\n\"Yes, but what do you think of her guilt or innocence?\"\n\n\"As to that,\" said Benham, calmly, \"I haven't the slightest doubt. She\nmurdered him.\"\n\nAs he said this, Brenton, forgetting himself for a moment, sprang\nforward as if to strangle the lawyer. The statement Benham had made\nseemed the most appalling piece of treachery. That men should take a\nwoman's money for defending her, and actually engage in a case when they\nbelieved their client guilty, appeared to Brenton simply infamous.\n\n\"I agree with you,\" said Brown. \"Of course she was the only one to\nbenefit by his death. The simple fool willed everything to her, and she\nknew it; and his doing so is the more astounding when you remember he\nwas quite well aware that she had a former lover whom she would gladly\nhave married if he had been as rich as Brenton. The supreme idiocy of\nsome men as far as their wives are concerned is something awful.\"\n\n[Illustration: Publicity.]\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Benham, \"it is. But I tell you, Brown, she is no\nordinary woman. The very conception of that murder had a stroke of\noriginality about it that I very much admire. I do not remember anything\nlike it in the annals of crime. It is the true way in which a murder\nshould be committed. The very publicity of the occasion was a safeguard.\nThink of poisoning a man at a dinner that he has given himself, in the\nmidst of a score of friends. I tell you that there was a dash of bravery\nabout it that commands my admiration.\"\n\n\"Do you imagine Roland had anything to do with it?\"\n\n\"Well, I had my doubts about that at first, but I think he is innocent,\nalthough from what I know of the man he will not hesitate to share the\nproceeds of the crime. You mark my words, they will be married within\na year from now if she is acquitted. I believe Roland knows her to be\nguilty.\"\n\n\"I thought as much,\" said Brown, \"by his actions here, and by some\nremarks he let drop. Anyhow, our credit in the affair will be all the\ngreater if we succeed in getting her off. Yes,\" he continued, rising and\npushing back his chair, \"Madam Brenton is a murderess.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nBrenton found himself once more in the streets of Cincinnati, in a state\nof mind that can hardly be described. Rage and grief struggled for the\nmastery, and added to the tumult of these passions was the uncertainty\nas to what he should do, or what he _could_ do. He could hardly ask the\nadvice of Ferris again, for his whole trouble arose from his neglect of\nthe counsel that gentleman had already given him. In his new sphere he\ndid not know where to turn. He found himself wondering whether in the\nspirit-land there was any firm of lawyers who could advise him, and he\nremembered then how singularly ignorant he was regarding the conditions\nof existence in the world to which he now belonged. However, he felt\nthat he must consult with somebody, and Ferris was the only one to whom\nhe could turn. A moment later he was face to face with him.\n\n\"Mr. Ferris,\" he said, \"I am in the most grievous trouble, and I come to\nyou in the hope that, if you cannot help me, you can at least advise me\nwhat to do.\"\n\n\"If your trouble has come,\" answered Ferris, with a shade of irony in\nhis voice, \"through following the advice that I have already given you,\nI shall endeavour, as well as I am able, to help you out of it.\"\n\n\"You know very well,\" cried Brenton, hotly, \"that my whole trouble\nhas occurred through neglecting your advice, or, at least, through\ndeliberately not following it. I _could_ not follow it.\"\n\n\"Very well, then,\" said Ferris, \"I am not surprised that you are in a\ndifficulty. You must remember that such a crisis is an old story with us\nhere.\"\n\n\"But, my dear sir,\" said Brenton, \"look at the appalling condition of\nthings, the knowledge of which has just come to me. It seems I was\npoisoned, but of course that doesn't matter. I feel no resentment\nagainst the wretch who did it. But the terrible thing is that my wife\nhas been arrested for the crime, and I have just learned that her own\nlawyers actually believe her guilty.\"\n\n\"That fact,\" said Ferris, calmly, \"will not interfere with their\neloquent pleading when the case comes to trial.\"\n\nBrenton glared at the man who was taking things so coolly, and who\nproved himself so unsympathetic; but an instant after he realized the\nfutility of quarrelling with the only person who could give him advice,\nso he continued, with what patience he could command--\n\n\"The situation is this: My wife has been arrested for the crime of\nmurdering me. She is now in the custody of the sheriff. Her trouble and\nanxiety of mind are fearful to contemplate.\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Ferris, \"there is no reason why you or anybody else\nshould contemplate it.\"\n\n\"How can you talk in that cold-blooded way?\" cried Brenton, indignantly.\n\"Could you see _your_ wife, or any one _you_ held dear, incarcerated for\na dreadful crime, and yet remain calm and collected, as you now appear\nto be when you hear of another's misfortune?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said Ferris, \"of course it is not to be expected that\none who has had so little experience with this existence should have any\nsense of proportion. You appear to be speaking quite seriously. You do\nnot seem at all to comprehend the utter triviality of all this.\"\n\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Brenton, \"do you call it a trivial thing that a\nwoman is in danger of her life for a crime which she never committed?\"\n\n\"If she is innocent,\" said the other, in no way moved by the indignation\nof his comrade, \"surely that state of things will be brought out in the\ncourts, and no great harm will be done, even looking at things from the\nstandpoint of the world you have left. But I want you to get into the\nhabit of looking at things from the standpoint of this world, and not\nof the other. Suppose that what you would call the worst should\nhappen--suppose she is hanged--what then?\"\n\nBrenton stood simply speechless with indignation at this brutal remark.\n\n\"If you will just look at things correctly,\" continued Ferris,\nimperturbably, \"you will see that there is probably a moment of anguish,\nperhaps not even that moment, and then your wife is here with you in the\nland of spirits. I am sure that is a consummation devoutly to be wished.\nEven a man in your state of mind must see the reasonableness of this.\nNow, looking at the question in what you would call its most serious\naspect, see how little it amounts to. It isn't worth a moment's thought,\nwhichever way it goes.\"\n\n\"You think nothing, then, of the disgrace of such a death--of the bitter\ninjustice of it?\"\n\n[Illustration: The broken toy.]\n\n\"When you were in the world did you ever see a child cry over a broken\ntoy? Did the sight pain you to any extent? Did you not know that a new\ntoy could be purchased that would quite obliterate all thoughts of the\nother? Did the simple griefs of childhood carry any deep and lasting\nconsternation to the mind of a grown-up man? Of course it did not. You\nare sensible enough to know that. Well, we here in this world look on\nthe pain and struggles and trials of people in the world you have left,\njust as an aged man looks on the tribulations of children over a broken\ndoll. That is all it really amounts to. That is what I mean when I say\nthat you have not yet got your sense of proportion. Any grief and misery\nthere is in the world you have left is of such an ephemeral, transient\nnature, that when we think for a moment of the free, untrammelled,\nand painless life there is beyond, those petty troubles sink into\ninsignificance. My dear fellow, be sensible, take my advice. I have\nreally a strong interest in you, and I advise you, entirely for your own\nwelfare, to forget all about it. Very soon you will have something much\nmore important to do than lingering around the world you have left. If\nyour wife comes amongst us I am sure you will be glad to welcome her,\nand to teach her the things that you will have already found out of your\nnew life. If she does not appear, then you will know that, even from the\nold-world standpoint, things have gone what you would call 'all right.'\nLet these trivial matters go, and attend to the vastly more important\nconcerns that will soon engage your attention here.\"\n\nFerris talked earnestly, and it was evident, even to Brenton, that he\nmeant what he said. It was hard to find a pretext for a quarrel with a\nman at once so calm and so perfectly sure of himself.\n\n\"We will not talk any more about it,\" said Brenton. \"I presume people\nhere agree to differ, just as they did in the world we have both left.\"\n\n\"Certainly, certainly,\" answered Ferris. \"Of course, you have just heard\nmy opinion; but you will find myriads of others who do not share it with\nme. You will meet a great many who are interested in the subject of\ncommunication with the world they have left. You will, of course, excuse\nme when I say that I consider such endeavours not worth talking about.\"\n\n\"Do you know any one who is interested in that sort of thing? and can\nyou give me an introduction to him?\"\n\n\"Oh! for that matter,\" said Ferris, \"you have had an introduction to one\nof the most enthusiastic investigators of the subject. I refer to Mr.\nJohn Speed, late of Chicago.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Brenton, rather dubiously. \"I must confess that I was\nnot very favourably impressed with Mr. Speed. Probably I did him an\ninjustice.\"\n\n\"You certainly did,\" said Ferris. \"You will find Speed a man well worth\nknowing, even if he does waste himself on such futile projects as a\nscheme for communicating with a community so evanescent as that of\nChicago. You will like Speed better the more you know him. He really is\nvery philanthropic, and has Sommers on his hands just now. From what he\nsaid after you left Venice, I imagine he does not entertain the same\nfeeling toward you as you do toward him. I would see Speed if I were\nyou.\"\n\n\"I will think about it,\" said Brenton, as they separated.\n\nTo know that a man thinks well of a person is no detriment to further\nacquaintance with that man, even if the first impressions have not been\nfavourable; and after Ferris told Brenton that Speed had thought well of\nhim, Brenton found less difficulty in seeking the Chicago enthusiast.\n\n\"I have been in a good deal of trouble,\" Brenton said to Speed, \"and\nhave been talking to Ferris about it. I regret to say that he gave me\nvery little encouragement, and did not seem at all to appreciate my\nfeelings in the matter.\"\n\n\"Oh, you mustn't mind Ferris,\" said Speed. \"He is a first-rate fellow,\nbut he is as cold and unsympathetic as--well, suppose we say as an\noyster. His great hobby is non-intercourse with the world we have left.\nNow, in that I don't agree with him, and there are thousands who don't\nagree with him. I admit that there are cases where a man is more unhappy\nif he frequents the old world than he would be if he left it alone. But\nthen there are other cases where just the reverse is true. Take my own\nexperience, for example; I take a peculiar pleasure in rambling around\nChicago. I admit that it is a grievance to me, as an old newspaper man,\nto see the number of scoops I could have on my esteemed contemporaries,\nbut--\"\n\n\"Scoop? What is that?\" asked Brenton, mystified.\n\n\"Why, a scoop is a beat, you know.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I don't know. What is a beat?\"\n\n\"A beat or a scoop, my dear fellow, is the getting of a piece of news\nthat your contemporary does not obtain. You never were in the newspaper\nbusiness? Well, sir, you missed it. Greatest business in the world. You\nknow everything that is going on long before anybody else does, and the\nway you can reward your friends and jump with both feet on your enemies\nis one of the delights of existence down there.\"\n\n\"Well, what I wanted to ask you was this,\" said Brenton. \"You have made\na speciality of finding out whether there could be any communication\nbetween one of us, for instance, and one who is an inhabitant of the\nother world. Is such communication possible?\"\n\n\"I have certainly devoted some time to it, but I can't say that my\nsuccess has been flattering. My efforts have been mostly in the line of\nnews. I have come on some startling information which my facilities here\ngave me access to, and I confess I have tried my best to put some of the\nboys on to it. But there is a link loose somewhere. Now, what is your\ntrouble? Do you want to get a message to anybody?\"\n\n\"My trouble is this,\" said Brenton, briefly, \"I am here because a few\ndays ago I was poisoned.\"\n\n\"George Washington!\" cried the other, \"you don't say so! Have the\nnewspapers got on to the fact?\"\n\n\"I regret to say that they have.\"\n\n\"What an item that would have been if one paper had got hold of it and\nthe others hadn't! I suppose they all got on to it at the same time?\"\n\n\"About that,\" said Brenton, \"I don't know, and I must confess that I do\nnot care very much. But here is the trouble--my wife has been arrested\nfor my murder, and she is as innocent as I am.\"\n\n\"Sure of that?\"\n\n\"_Sure_ of it?\" cried the other indignantly. \"Of course I am sure of\nit.\"\n\n\"Then who is the guilty person?\"\n\n\"Ah, that,\" said Brenton, \"I do not yet know.\"\n\n\"Then how can you be sure she is not guilty?\"\n\n\"If you talk like that,\" exclaimed Brenton, \"I have nothing more to\nsay.\"\n\n\"Now, don't get offended, I beg of you. I am merely looking at this from\na newspaper standpoint, you know. You must remember it is not you\nwho will decide the matter, but a jury of your very stupid\nfellow-countrymen. Now, you can never tell what a jury _will_ do, except\nthat it will do something idiotic. Therefore, it seems to me that the\nvery first step to be taken is to find out who the guilty party is.\nDon't you see the force of that?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do.\"\n\n\"Very well, then. Now, what were the circumstances of this crime? who\nwas to profit by your death?\"\n\nBrenton winced at this.\n\n\"I see how it is,\" said the other, \"and I understand why you don't\nanswer. Now--you'll excuse me if I am frank--your wife was the one who\nbenefited most by your death, was she not?\"\n\n\"No,\" cried the other indignantly, \"she was not the one. That is what\nthe lawyers said. Why in the world should she want to poison me, when\nshe had all my wealth at her command as it was?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's a strong point,\" said Speed. \"You were a reasonably good\nhusband, I suppose? Rather generous with the cash?\"\n\n\"Generous?\" cried the other. \"My wife always had everything she wanted.\"\n\n\"Ah, well, there was no--you'll excuse me, I am sure--no former lover in\nthe case, was there?\"\n\nAgain Brenton winced, and he thought of Roland sitting beside his wife\nwith her hand in his.\n\n\"I see,\" said Speed; \"you needn't answer. Now what were the\ncircumstances, again?\"\n\n\"They were these: At a dinner which I gave, where some twenty or\ntwenty-five of my friends were assembled, poison, it appears, was put\ninto my cup of coffee. That is all I know of it.\"\n\n\"Who poured out that cup of coffee?\"\n\n\"My wife did.\"\n\n\"Ah! Now, I don't for a moment say she is guilty, remember; but you must\nadmit that, to a stupid jury, the case _might_ look rather bad against\nher.\"\n\n\"Well, granted that it does, there is all the more need that I should\ncome to her assistance if possible.\"\n\n\"Certainly, certainly!\" said Speed. \"Now, I'll tell you what we have\nto do. We must get, if possible, one of the very brightest Chicago\nreporters on the track of this thing, and we have to get him on the\ntrack of it early. Come with me to Chicago. We will try an experiment,\nand I am sure you will lend your mind entirely to the effort. We must\nact in conjunction in this affair, and you are just the man I've been\nwanting, some one who is earnest and who has something at stake in the\nmatter. We may fail entirely, but I think it's worth the trying. Will\nyou come?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Brenton; \"and I cannot tell you how much I appreciate\nyour interest and sympathy.\"\n\nArriving at a brown stone building on the corner of two of the principal\nstreets in Chicago, Brenton and Speed ascended quickly to one of the top\nfloors. It was nearly midnight, and two upper stories of the huge dark\nbuilding were brilliantly lighted, as was shown on the outside by the\nlong rows of glittering windows. They entered a room where a man was\nseated at a table, with coat and vest thrown off, and his hat set well\nback on his head. Cold as it was outside, it was warm in this man's\nroom, and the room was blue with smoke. A black corn-cob pipe was in his\nteeth, and the man was writing away as if for dear life, on sheets of\ncoarse white copy paper, stopping now and then to fill up his pipe or to\nrelight it after it had gone out.\n\n\"There,\" said Speed, waving his hand towards the writer with a certain\nair of proprietory pride, \"there sits one of the very cleverest men on\nthe Chicago press. That fellow, sir, is gifted with a nose for news\nwhich has no equal in America. He will ferret out a case that he once\nstarts on with an unerringness that would charm you. Yes, sir, I got him\nhis present situation on this paper, and I can tell you it was a good\none.\"\n\n\"He must have been a warm friend of yours?\" said Brenton, indifferently,\nas if he did not take much interest in the eulogy.\n\n\"Quite the contrary,\" said Speed. \"He was a warm enemy, made it mighty\nwarm for _me_ sometimes. He was on an opposition paper, but I tell you,\nalthough I was no chicken in newspaper business, that man would scoop\nthe daylight out of me any time he tried. So, to get rid of opposition,\nI got the managing editor to appoint him to a place on our paper; and\nI tell you, he has never regretted it. Yes, sir, there sits George\nStratton, a man who knows his business. Now,\" he said, \"let us\nconcentrate our attention on him. First let us see whether, by putting\nour whole minds to it, we can make any impression on _his_ mind\nwhatever. You see how busily he is engaged. He is thoroughly absorbed in\nhis work. That is George all over. Whatever his assignment is, George\nthrows himself right into it, and thinks of nothing else until it is\nfinished. _Now_ then.\"\n\nIn that dingy, well-lighted room George Stratton sat busily pencilling\nout the lines that were to appear in next morning's paper. He was\nevidently very much engrossed in his task, as Speed had said. If he\nhad looked about him, which he did not, he would have said that he was\nentirely alone. All at once his attention seemed to waver, and he passed\nhis hand over his brow, while perplexity came into his face. Then he\nnoticed that his pipe was out, and, knocking the ashes from it by\nrapping the bowl on the side of the table, he filled it with an\nabsent-mindedness unusual with him. Again he turned to his writing, and\nagain he passed his hand over his brow. Suddenly, without any apparent\ncause, he looked first to the right and then to the left of him. Once\nmore he tried to write, but, noticing his pipe was out, he struck\nanother match and nervously puffed away, until clouds of blue smoke rose\naround him. There was a look of annoyance and perplexity in his face as\nhe bent resolutely to his writing. The door opened, and a man appeared\non the threshold.\n\n\"Anything more about the convention, George?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes; I am just finishing this. Sort of pen pictures, you know.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you can let me have what you have done. I'll fix it up.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Stratton, bunching up the manuscript in front of him,\nand handing it to the city editor.\n\nThat functionary looked at the number of pages, and then at the writer.\n\n\"Much more of this, George?\" he said. \"We'll be a little short of room\nin the morning, you know.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the other, sitting back in his chair, \"it is pretty good\nstuff that. Folks always like the pen pictures of men engaged in the\nskirmish better than the reports of what most of them say.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the city editor, \"that's so.\"\n\n\"Still,\" said Stratton, \"we could cut it off at the last page. Just let\nme see the last two pages, will you?\"\n\nThese were handed to him, and, running his eye through them, he drew his\nknife across one of the pages, and put at the bottom the cabalistic mark\nwhich indicated the end of the copy.\n\n\"There! I think I will let it go at that. Old Rickenbeck don't amount to\nmuch, anyhow. We'll let him go.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said the city editor. \"I think we won't want anything more\nto-night.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"She's pretty as a picture.\"]\n\nStratton put his hands behind his head, with his fingers interlaced, and\nleaned back in his chair, placing his heels upon the table before him.\nA thought-reader, looking at his face, could almost have followed the\ntheme that occupied his mind. Suddenly bringing his feet down with a\ncrash to the floor, he rose and went into the city editor's room.\n\n\"See here,\" he said. \"Have you looked into that Cincinnati case at all?\"\n\n\"What Cincinnati case?\" asked the local editor, looking up.\n\n\"Why, that woman who is up for poisoning her husband.\"\n\n\"Oh yes; we had something of it in the despatches this morning. It's\nrather out of the local line, you know.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know it is. But it isn't out of the paper's line. I tell you\nthat case is going to make a sensation. She's pretty as a picture. Been\nmarried only six months, and it seems to be a dead sure thing that\nshe poisoned her husband. That trial's going to make racy reading,\nespecially if they bring in a verdict of guilty.\"\n\nThe city editor looked interested.\n\n\"Want to go down there, George?\"\n\n\"Well, do you know, I think it'll pay.\"\n\n\"Let me see, this is the last day of the convention, isn't it? And Clark\ncomes back from his vacation to-morrow. Well, if you think it's worth\nit, take a trip down there, and look the ground over, and give us a\nspecial article that we can use on the first day of the trial.\"\n\n\"I'll do it,\" said George.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSpeed looked at Brenton.\n\n\"What would old Ferris say _now_, eh?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nNext morning George Stratton was on the railway train speeding towards\nCincinnati. As he handed to the conductor his mileage book, he did not\nsay to him, lightly transposing the old couplet--\n\n  \"Here, railroad man, take thrice thy fee,\n  For spirits twain do ride with me.\"\n\nGeorge Stratton was a practical man, and knew nothing of spirits, except\nthose which were in a small flask in his natty little valise.\n\nWhen he reached Cincinnati, he made straight for the residence of the\nsheriff. He felt that his first duty was to become friends with such an\nimportant official. Besides this, he wished to have an interview with\nthe prisoner. He had arranged in his mind, on the way there, just how he\nwould write a preliminary article that would whet the appetite of the\nreaders of the Chicago _Argus_ for any further developments that might\noccur during and after the trial. He would write the whole thing in the\nform of a story.\n\n[Illustration: \"Raising the veil.\"]\n\nFirst, there would be a sketch of the life of Mrs. Brenton and her\nhusband. This would be number one, and above it would be the Roman\nnumeral I. Under the heading II. would be a history of the crime. Under\nIII. what had occurred afterwards--the incidents that had led suspicion\ntowards the unfortunate woman, and that sort of thing. Under the numeral\nIV. would be his interview with the prisoner, if he were fortunate\nenough to get one. Under V. he would give the general opinion of\nCincinnati on the crime, and on the guilt or innocence of Mrs. Brenton.\nThis article he already saw in his mind's eye occupying nearly half a\npage of the _Argus_. All would be in leaded type, and written in a style\nand manner that would attract attention, for he felt that he was\nfirst on the ground, and would not have the usual rush in preparing\nhis copy which had been the bane of his life. It would give the\n_Argus_ practically the lead in this case, which he was convinced\nwould become one of national importance.\n\nThe sheriff received him courteously, and, looking at the card he\npresented, saw the name Chicago _Argus_ in the corner. Then he stood\nvisibly on his guard--an attitude assumed by all wise officials when\nthey find themselves brought face to face with a newspaper man; for\nthey know, however carefully an article may be prepared, it will likely\ncontain some unfortunate overlooked phrase which may have a damaging\neffect in a future political campaign.\n\n\"I wanted to see you,\" began Stratton, coming straight to the point, \"in\nreference to the Brenton murder.\"\n\n\"I may say at once,\" replied the sheriff, \"that if you wish an interview\nwith the prisoner, it is utterly impossible, because her lawyers, Benham\nand Brown, have positively forbidden her to see a newspaper man.\"\n\n\"That shows,\" said Stratton, \"they are wise men who understand their\nbusiness. Nevertheless, I wish to have an interview with Mrs. Brenton.\nBut what I wanted to say to you is this: I believe the case will be very\nmuch talked about, and that before many weeks are over. Of course you\nknow the standing the _Argus_ has in newspaper circles. What it says\nwill have an influence, even over the Cincinnati press. I think you will\nadmit that. Now a great many newspaper men consider an official their\nnatural enemy. I do not; at least, I do not until I am forced to. Any\nreference that I may make to you I am more than willing to submit to you\nbefore it goes to Chicago. I will give you my word, if you want it, that\nnothing will be said referring to your official position, or to yourself\npersonally, that you do not see before it appears in print. Of course\nyou will be up for re-election. I never met a sheriff who wasn't.\"\n\nThe sheriff smiled at this, and did not deny it.\n\n\"Very well. Now, I may tell you my belief is that this case is going\nto have a powerful influence on your re-election. Here is a young and\npretty woman who is to be tried for a terrible crime. Whether she is\nguilty or innocent, public sympathy is going to be with her. If I were\nin your place, I would prefer to be known as her friend rather than as\nher enemy.\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said the sheriff, \"my official position puts me in the\nattitude of neither friend nor enemy of the unfortunate woman. I have\nsimply a certain duty to do, and that duty I intend to perform.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right!\" exclaimed the newspaper man, jauntily. \"I, for\none, am not going to ask you to take a step outside your duties; but an\nofficial may do his duty, and yet, at the same time, do a friendly act\nfor a newspaper man, or even for a prisoner. In the language of the old\nchestnut, 'If you don't help me, don't help the bear.' That's all I\nask.\"\n\n\"You maybe sure, Mr. Stratton, that anything I can do to help you I\nshall be glad to do; and now let me give you a hint. If you want to see\nMrs. Brenton, the best thing is to get permission from her lawyers. If\nI were you I would not see Benham--he's rather a hard nut, Benham is,\nalthough you needn't tell him I said so. You get on the right side of\nBrown. Brown has some political aspirations himself, and he does not\nwant to offend a man on so powerful a paper as the _Argus_, even if it\nis not a Cincinnati paper. Now, if you make him the same offer you have\nmade to me, I think it will be all right. If he sees your copy before it\ngoes into print, and if you keep your word with him that nothing will\nappear that he does _not_ see, I think you will succeed in getting an\ninterview with Mrs. Brenton. If you bring me a note from Brown, I shall\nbe very glad to allow you to see her.\"\n\nStratton thanked the sheriff for his hint. He took down in his note-book\nthe address of the lawyers, and the name especially of Mr. Brown. The\ntwo men shook hands, and Stratton felt that they understood each other.\n\nWhen Mr. Stratton was ushered into the private office of Brown, and\nhanded that gentleman his card, he noticed the lawyer perceptibly freeze\nover.\n\n\"Ahem,\" said the legal gentleman; \"you will excuse me if I say that my\ntime is rather precious. Did you wish to see me professionally?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Stratton, \"that is, from a newspaper standpoint of the\nprofession.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the other, \"in reference to what?\"\n\n\"To the Brenton case.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear sir, I have had, very reluctantly, to refuse information\nthat I would have been happy to give, if I could, to our own newspaper\nmen; and so I may say to you at once that I scarcely think it will\nbe possible for me to be of any service to an outside paper like the\n_Argus_\"\n\n\"Local newspaper men,\" said Stratton, \"represent local fame. That\nyou already possess. I represent national fame, which, if you will\nexcuse my saying so, you do not yet possess. The fact that I am in\nCincinnati to-day, instead of in Chicago, shows what we Chicago people\nthink of the Cincinnati case. I believe, and the _Argus_ believes, that\nthis case is going to be one of national importance. Now, let me ask you\none question. Will you state frankly what your objection is to having\na newspaper man, for instance, interview Mrs. Brenton, or get any\ninformation relating to this case from her or others whom you have the\npower of controlling?\"\n\n\"I shall answer that question,\" said Brown, \"as frankly as you put\nit. You are a man of the world, and know, of course, that we are all\nselfish, and in business matters look entirely after our own interests.\nMy interest in this case is to defend my client. Your interest in\nthis case is to make a sensational article. You want to get facts if\npossible, but, in any event, you want to write up a readable column or\ntwo for your paper. Now, if I allowed you to see Mrs. Brenton, she might\nsay something to you, and you might publish it, that would not only\nendanger her chances, but would seriously embarrass us, as her lawyers,\nin our defence of the case.\"\n\n\"You have stated the objection very plainly and forcibly,\" said\nStratton, with a look of admiration, as if the powerful arguments of\nthe lawyer had had a great effect on him. \"Now, if I understand your\nargument, it simply amounts to this, that you would have no objection to\nmy interviewing Mrs. Brenton if you have the privilege of editing the\ncopy. In other words, if nothing were printed but what you approve\nof, you would not have the slightest hesitancy about allowing me that\ninterview.\"\n\n\"No, I don't know that I would,\" admitted the lawyer.\n\n\"Very well, then. Here is my proposition to you: I am here to look after\nthe interests of our paper in this particular case. The _Argus_ is\nprobably going to be the first paper outside of Cincinnati that will\ndevote a large amount of space to the Brenton trial, in addition to what\nis received from the Associated Press dispatches. Now you can give me a\ngreat many facilities in this matter if you care to do so, and in return\nI am perfectly willing to submit to you every line of copy that concerns\nyou or your client before it is sent, and I give you my word of honour\nthat nothing shall appear but what you have seen and approved of. If\nyou want to cut out something that I think is vitally important, then I\nshall tell you frankly that I intend to print it, but will modify it as\nmuch as I possibly can to suit your views.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said the lawyer. \"In other words, as you have just remarked,\nI am to give you special facilities in this matter, and then, when you\nfind out some fact which I wish kept secret, and which you have obtained\nbecause of the facilities I have given to you, you will quite frankly\ntell me that it must go in, and then, of course, I shall be helpless\nexcept to debar you from any further facilities, as you call them. No,\nsir, I do not care to make any such bargain.\"\n\n\"Well, suppose I strike out that clause of agreement, and say to you\nthat I will send nothing but what you approve of, would you then write\nme a note to the sheriff and allow me to see the prisoner?\"\n\n\"I am sorry to say\"--the lawyer hesitated for a moment, and glanced at\nthe card, then added--\"Mr. Stratton, that I do not see my way clear to\ngranting your request.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Stratton, rising, \"that you are doing yourself an\ninjustice. You are refusing--I may as well tell you first as last--what\nis a great privilege. Now, you have had some experience in your\nbusiness, and I have had some experience in mine, and I beg to inform\nyou that men who are much more prominent in the history of their country\nthan any one I can at present think of in Cincinnati, have tried to balk\nme in the pursuit of my business, and have failed.\"\n\n\"In that matter, of course,\" said Brown, \"I must take my chances. I\ndon't see the use of prolonging this interview. As you have been so\nfrank as to--I won't say threaten, perhaps warn is the better word--as\nyou have been so good as to warn me, I may, before we part, just give\n_you_ a word of caution. Of course we, in Cincinnati, are perfectly\nwilling to admit that Chicago people are the smartest on earth, but I\nmay say that if you print a word in your paper which is untrue and which\nis damaging to our side of the case, or if you use any methods that\nare unlawful in obtaining the information you so much desire, you will\ncertainly get your paper into trouble, and you will run some little\npersonal risk yourself.\"\n\n\"Well, as you remarked a moment ago, Mr. Brown, I shall have to take the\nchances of that. I am here to get the news, and if I don't succeed it\nwill be the first time in my life.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" said the lawyer. \"I wish you good evening.\"\n\n\"Just one thing more,\" said the newspaper man, \"before I leave you.\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said the lawyer, impatiently, \"I am very busy. I've\nalready given you a liberal share of my time. I must request that this\ninterview end at once.\"\n\n\"I thought,\" said Mr. Stratton, calmly, \"that perhaps you might be\ninterested in the first article that I am going to write. I shall devote\none column in the _Argus_ of the day after to-morrow to your defence of\nthe case, and whether your theory of defence is a tenable one or not.\"\n\nMr. Brown pushed back his chair and looked earnestly at the young man.\nThat individual was imperturbably pulling on his gloves, and at the\nmoment was buttoning one of them.\n\n\"Our _defence_!\" cried the lawyer. \"What do you know of our defence?\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Stratton, \"I know _all_ about it.\"\n\n\"Sir, that is impossible. Nobody knows what our defence is to be except\nMr. Benham and myself.\"\n\n\"And Mr. Stratton, of the Chicago _Argus_,\" replied the young man, as he\nbuttoned his coat.\n\n\"May I ask, then, what the defence is?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered the Chicago man. \"Your defence is that Mr. Brenton\nwas insane, and that he committed suicide.\"\n\nEven Mr. Brown's habitual self-control, acquired by long years of\ntraining in keeping his feelings out of sight, for the moment deserted\nhim. He drew his breath sharply, and cast a piercing glance at the young\nman before him, who was critically watching the lawyer's countenance,\nalthough he appeared to be entirely absorbed in buttoning his overcoat.\nThen Mr. Brown gave a short, dry laugh.\n\n\"I have met a bluff before,\" he said carelessly; \"but I should like to\nknow what makes you think that such is our defence?\"\n\n\"_Think_!\" cried the young man. \"I don't think at all; I _know_ it.\"\n\n\"How do you know it?\"\n\n\"Well, for one thing, I know it by your own actions a moment ago. What\nfirst gave me an inkling of your defence was that book which is on\nyour table. It is Forbes Winslow on the mind and the brain; a very\ninteresting book, Mr. Brown, _very_ interesting indeed. It treats of\nsuicide, and the causes and conditions of the brain that will lead up\nto it. It is a very good book, indeed, to study in such a case. Good\nevening, Mr. Brown. I am sorry that we cannot co-operate in this\nmatter.\"\n\nStratton turned and walked toward the door, while the lawyer gazed after\nhim with a look of helpless astonishment on his face. As Stratton placed\nhis hand on the door knob, the lawyer seemed to wake up as from a dream.\n\n\"Stop!\" he cried; \"I will give you a letter that will admit you to Mrs.\nBrenton.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\n\"There!\" said Speed to Brenton, triumphantly, \"what do you think of\n_that_? Didn't I say George Stratton was the brightest newspaper man in\nChicago? I tell you, his getting that letter from old Brown was one of\nthe cleverest bits of diplomacy I ever saw. There you had quickness of\nperception, and nerve. All the time he was talking to old Brown he was\njust taking that man's measure. See how coolly he acted while he was\ndrawing on his gloves and buttoning his coat as if ready to leave. Flung\nthat at Brown all of a sudden as quiet as if he was saying nothing at\nall unusual, and all the time watching Brown out of the tail of his eye.\nWell, sir, I must admit, that although I have known George Stratton for\nyears, I thought he was dished by that Cincinnati lawyer. I thought that\nGeorge was just gracefully covering up his defeat, and there he upset\nold Brown's apple-cart in the twinkling of an eye. Now, you see the\neffect of all this. Brown has practically admitted to him what the line\nof defence is. Stratton won't publish it, of course; he has promised not\nto, but you see he can hold that over Brown's head, and get everything\nhe wants unless they change their defence.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" remarked Brenton, slowly, \"he seems to be a very sharp newspaper\nman indeed; but I don't like the idea of his going to interview my\nwife.\"\n\n\"Why, what is there wrong about that?\"\n\n\"Well, there is this wrong about it--that she in her depression may say\nsomething that will tell against her.\"\n\n\"Even if she does, what of it? Isn't the lawyer going to see the letter\nbefore it is sent to the paper?\"\n\n\"I am not so sure about that. Do you think Stratton will show the\narticle to Brown if he gets what you call a scoop or a beat?\"\n\n\"Why, of course he will,\" answered Speed, indignantly; \"hasn't he given\nhim his word that he will?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know he has,\" said Brenton, dubiously; \"but he is a newspaper\nman.\"\n\n\"Certainly he is,\" answered Speed, with strong emphasis; \"that is the\nreason he will keep his word.\"\n\n\"I hope so, I hope so; but I must admit that the more I know you\nnewspaper men, the more I see the great temptation you are under to\npreserve if possible the sensational features of an article.\"\n\n\"I'll bet you a drink--no, we can't do that,\" corrected Speed; \"but you\nshall see that, if Brown acts square with Stratton, he will keep his\nword to the very letter with Brown. There is no use in our talking about\nthe matter here. Let us follow Stratton, and see what comes of the\ninterview.\"\n\n\"I think I prefer to go alone,\" said Brenton, coldly.\n\n\"Oh, as you like, as you like,\" answered the other, shortly. \"I thought\nyou wanted my help in this affair; but if you don't, I am sure I shan't\nintrude.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" said Brenton; \"come along. By the way, Speed, what\ndo you think of that line of defence?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know enough of the circumstances of the case to know what\nto think of it. It seems to me rather a good line.\"\n\n\"It can't be a good line when it is not true. It is certain to break\ndown.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" said Speed; \"but I'll bet you four dollars and a half that\nthey'll prove you a raving maniac before they are through with you.\nThey'll show very likely that you tried to poison yourself two or three\ntimes; bring on a dozen of your friends to prove that they knew all your\nlife you were insane.\"\n\n\"Do you think they will?\" asked Brenton, uneasily.\n\n\"Think it? Why, I am sure of it. You'll go down to posterity as one of\nthe most complete lunatics that ever, lived in Cincinnati. Oh, there\nwon't be anything left of you when _they_ get through with you.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Stratton was making his way to the residence of the sheriff.\n\n\"Ah,\" said that official, when they met, \"you got your letter, did you?\nWell, I thought you would.\"\n\n\"If you had heard the conversation between my estimable friend Mr. Brown\nand myself, up to the very last moment, you wouldn't have thought it.\"\n\n\"Well, Brown is generally very courteous towards newspaper men, and\nthat's one reason you see his name in the papers a great deal.\"\n\n\"If I were a Cincinnati newspaper man, I can assure you that his name\nwouldn't appear very much in the columns of my paper.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to hear you say that. I thought Brown was very popular with\nthe newspaper men. You got the letter, though, did you?\"\n\n\"Yes; I got it. Here it is. Read it.\"\n\nThe sheriff scanned the brief note over, and put it in his pocket.\n\n\"Just take a chair for a moment, will you, and I will see if Mrs.\nBrenton is ready to receive you.\"\n\n[Illustration: Jane.]\n\nStratton seated himself, and, pulling a paper from his pocket, was\nbusily reading when the sheriff again entered.\n\n\"I am sorry to say,\" he began, \"after you have had all this trouble,\nthat Mrs. Brenton positively refuses to see you. You know I cannot\n_compel_ a prisoner to meet any one. You understand that, of course.\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" said Stratton, thinking for a moment. \"See here, sheriff,\nI have simply _got_ to have a talk with that woman. Now, can't you tell\nher I knew her husband, or something of that sort? I'll make it all\nright when I see her.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The scoundrel!\" said Brenton to Speed, as Stratton made this remark.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Speed, \"don't you see he is just the man we want?\nThis is not the time to be particular.\"\n\n\"Yes, but think of the treachery and meanness of telling a poor\nunfortunate woman that he was acquainted with her husband, who is only a\nfew days dead.\"\n\n\"Now, see here,\" said Speed, \"if you are going to look on matters in\nthis way you will be a hindrance and not a help in the affair. Don't you\nappreciate the situation? Why, Mrs. Brenton's own lawyers, as you have\nsaid, think her guilty. What, then, can they learn by talking with her,\nor what good can they do her with their minds already prejudiced against\nher? Don't you see that?\"\n\nBrenton made no answer to this, but it was evident he was very ill at\nease.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Did you know her husband?\" asked the sheriff.\n\n\"No, to tell you the truth, I never heard of him before. But I must see\nthis lady, both for my good and hers, and I am not going to let a little\nthing like that stand between us. Won't you tell her that I have come\nwith a letter from her own lawyers? Just show her the letter, and say\nthat I will take up but very little of her time. I am sorry to ask this\nmuch of you, but you see how I am placed.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" said the sheriff, good-naturedly; \"I shall be\nvery glad to do what you wish,\" and with that he once more disappeared.\n\nThe sheriff stayed away longer this time, and Stratton paced the room\nimpatiently. Finally, the official returned, and said--\n\n\"Mrs. Brenton has consented to see you. Come this way, please. You\nwill excuse me, I know,\" continued the sheriff, as they walked along\ntogether, \"but it is part of my duty to remain in the room while you\nare talking with Mrs. Brenton.\"\n\n\"Certainly, certainly,\" said Stratton; \"I understand that.\"\n\n\"Very well; then, if I may make a suggestion, I would say this: you\nshould be prepared to ask just what you want to know, and do it all as\nspeedily as possible, for really Mrs. Brenton is in a condition of\nnervous exhaustion that renders it almost cruel to put her through any\nrigid cross-examination.\"\n\n\"I understand that also,\" said Stratton; \"but you must remember\nthat she has a very much harder trial to undergo in the future. I am\nexceedingly anxious to get at the truth of this thing, and so, if it\nseems to you that I am asking a lot of very unnecessary questions, I\nhope you will not interfere with me as long as Mrs. Brenton consents to\nanswer.\"\n\n\"I shall not interfere at all,\" said the sheriff; \"I only wanted to\ncaution you, for the lady may break down at any moment. If you can\nmarshal your questions so that the most important ones come first, I\nthink it will be wise. I presume you have them pretty well arranged in\nyour own mind?\"\n\n\"Well, I can't say that I have; you see, I am entirely in the dark. I\ngot no help whatever from the lawyers, and from what I know of their\ndefence I am thoroughly convinced that they are on the wrong track.\"\n\n\"What! did Brown say anything about the defence? That is not like his\nusual caution.\"\n\n\"He didn't intend to,\" answered Stratton; \"but I found out all I wanted\nto know, nevertheless. You see, I shall have to ask what appears to be a\nlot of rambling, inconsequential questions because you can never tell in\na case like this when you may get the key to the whole mystery.\"\n\n\"Well, here we are,\" said the sheriff, as he knocked at a door, and then\npushed it open.\n\nFrom the moment George Stratton saw Mrs. Brenton his interest in the\ncase ceased to be purely journalistic.\n\nMrs. Brenton was standing near the window, and she appeared to be very\ncalm and collected, but her fingers twitched nervously, clasping and\nunclasping each other. Her modest dress of black was certainly a very\nbecoming one.\n\nGeorge thought he had never seen a woman so beautiful.\n\nAs she was standing up, she evidently intended the interview to be a\nshort one.\n\n\"Madam,\" said Stratton, \"I am very sorry indeed to trouble you; but I\nhave taken a great interest in the solution of this mystery, and I have\nyour lawyers' permission to visit you. I assure you, anything you say\nwill be submitted to them, so that there will be no danger of your case\nbeing prejudiced by any statements made.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid,\" said Mrs. Brenton, \"that the truth will injure or\nprejudice my case.\"\n\n\"I am sure of that,\" answered the newspaper man; and then, knowing that\nshe would not sit down if he asked her to, he continued diplomatically,\n\"Madam, will you permit me to sit down? I wish to write out my notes as\ncarefully as possible. Accuracy is my strong point.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Mrs. Brenton; and, seeing that it was not probable the\ninterview would be a short one, she seated herself by the window, while\nthe sheriff took a chair in the corner, and drew a newspaper from his\npocket.\n\n\"Now, madam,\" said the special, \"a great number of the questions I ask\nyou may seem trivial, but as I said to the sheriff a moment ago, some\nword of yours that appears to you entirely unconnected with the case may\ngive me a clue which will be exceedingly valuable. You will, therefore,\nI am sure, pardon me if some of the questions I ask you appear\nirrelevant.\"\n\nMrs. Brenton bowed her head, but said nothing.\n\n\"Were your husband's business affairs in good condition at the time of\nhis death?\"\n\n\"As far as I know they were.\"\n\n\"Did you ever see anything in your husband's actions that would lead you\nto think him a man who might have contemplated suicide?\"\n\nMrs. Brenton looked up with wide-open eyes.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she said.\n\n\"Had he ever spoken to you on the subject of suicide?\"\n\n\"I do not remember that he ever did.\"\n\n\"Was he ever queer in his actions? In short, did you ever notice\nanything about him that would lead you to doubt his sanity? I am sorry\nif questions I ask you seem painful, but I have reasons for wishing to\nbe certain on this point.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mrs. Brenton; \"he was perfectly sane. No man could have been\nmore so. I am certain that he never thought of committing suicide.\"\n\n\"Why are you so certain on that point?\"\n\n\"I do not know why. I only know I am positive of it.\"\n\n\"Do you know if he had any enemy who might wish his death?\"\n\n\"I doubt if he had an enemy in the world. I do not know of any.\"\n\n\"Have you ever heard him speak of anybody in a spirit of enmity?\"\n\n\"Never. He was not a man who bore enmity against people. Persons whom he\ndid not like he avoided.\"\n\n\"The poison, it is said, was put into his cup of coffee. Do you happen\nto know,\" said Stratton, turning to the sheriff, \"how they came to that\nconclusion?\"\n\n\"No, I do not,\" answered the sheriff. \"In fact, I don't see any reason\nwhy they should think so.\"\n\n\"Was morphia found in the coffee cup afterwards?\"\n\n\"No; at the time of the inquest all the things had been cleared away. I\nthink it was merely presumed that the morphine was put into his coffee.\"\n\n\"Who poured out the coffee he drank that night?\"\n\n\"I did,\" answered his wife.\n\n\"You were at one end of the table and he at the other, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How did the coffee cup reach him?\"\n\n\"I gave it to the servant, and she placed it before him.\"\n\n\"It passed through no other hands, then?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Who was the servant?\"\n\nMrs. Brenton pondered for a moment.\n\n\"I really know very little about her. She had been in our house for a\ncouple of weeks only.\"\n\n\"What was her name?\"\n\n\"Jane Morton, I think.\"\n\n\"Where is she now, do you know?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"She appeared at the inquest, of course?\" said Stratton, turning to the\nsheriff.\n\n\"I think she did,\" was the answer. \"I am not sure.\"\n\nHe marked her name down in the note-book.\n\n\"How many people were there at the dinner?\"\n\n\"Including my husband and myself, there were twenty-six.\"\n\n\"Could you give me the name of each of them?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so.\"\n\nShe repeated the names, which he took down, with certain notes and\ncomments on each.\n\n\"Who sat next your husband at the head of the table?\"\n\n\"Miss Walker was at his right hand, Mr. Roland at his left.\"\n\n\"Now, forgive me if I ask you if you have ever had any trouble with your\nhusband?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Never had any quarrel?\"\n\nMrs. Brenton hesitated for a moment.\n\n\"No, I don't think we ever had what could be called a quarrel.\"\n\n\"You had no disagreement shortly before the dinner?\"\n\nAgain Mrs. Brenton hesitated.\n\n\"I can hardly call it a disagreement,\" she said. \"We had a little\ndiscussion about some of the guests who were to be invited.\"\n\n\"Did he object to any that were there?\"\n\n\"There was a gentleman there whom he did not particularly like, I think,\nbut he made no objection to his coming; in fact, he seemed to feel that\nI might imagine he had an objection from a little discussion we had\nabout inviting him; and afterwards, as if to make up for that, he placed\nthis guest at his left hand.\"\n\nStratton quickly glanced up the page of his notebook, and marked a\nlittle cross before the name of Stephen Roland.\n\n\"You had another disagreement with him before, if I might term it so,\nhad you not?\"\n\nMrs. Brenton looked at him surprised.\n\n\"What makes you think so?\" she said.\n\n\"Because you hesitated when I spoke of it.\"\n\n\"Well, we had what you might call a disagreement once at Lucerne,\nSwitzerland.\"\n\n\"Will you tell me what it was about?\"\n\n\"I would rather not.\"\n\n\"Will you tell me this--was it about a gentleman?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Brenton.\n\n\"Was your husband of a jealous disposition?\"\n\n\"Ordinarily I do not think he was. It seemed to me at the time that he\nwas a little unjust--that's all.\"\n\n\"Was the gentleman in Lucerne?\"\n\n\"Oh no!\"\n\n\"In Cincinnati?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Was his name Stephen Roland?\"\n\nMrs. Brenton again glanced quickly at the newspaper man, and seemed\nabout to say something, but, checking herself, she simply answered--\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThen she leaned back in the armchair and sighed.\n\n\"I am very tired,\" she said. \"If it is not absolutely necessary, I\nprefer not to continue this conversation.\"\n\nStratton immediately rose.\n\n\"Madam,\" he said, \"I am very much obliged to you for the trouble you\nhave taken to answer my questions, which I am afraid must have seemed\nimpertinent to you, but I assure you that I did not intend them to be\nso. Now, madam, I would like very much to get a promise from you. I wish\nthat you would promise to see me if I call again, and I, on my part,\nassure you that unless I have something particularly important to tell\nyou, or to ask, I shall not intrude upon you.\"\n\n\"I shall be pleased to see you at any time, sir.\"\n\nWhen the sheriff and the newspaper man reached the other room, the\nformer said--\n\n\"Well, what do you think?\"\n\n\"I think it is an interesting case,\" was the answer.\n\n\"Or, to put it in other words, you think Mrs. Brenton a very interesting\nlady.\"\n\n\"Officially, sir, you have exactly stated my opinion.\"\n\n\"And I suppose, poor woman, she will furnish an interesting article for\nthe paper?\"\n\n\"Hang the paper!\" said Stratton, with more than his usual vim.\n\nThe sheriff laughed. Then he said--\n\n\"I confess that to me it seems a very perplexing affair all through.\nHave you got any light on the subject?\"\n\n\"My dear sir, I will tell you three important things. First, Mrs.\nBrenton is innocent. Second, her lawyers are taking the wrong line of\ndefence. Third,\" tapping his breast-pocket, \"I have the name of the\nmurderer in my note-book.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\n\"Now,\" said John Speed to William Brenton, \"we have got Stratton fairly\nstarted on the track, and I believe that he will ferret out the truth\nin this matter. But, meanwhile, we must not be idle. You must remember\nthat, with all our facilities for discovery, we really know nothing\nof the murderer ourselves. I propose we set about this thing just as\nsystematically as Stratton will. The chances are that we shall penetrate\nthe mystery of the whole affair very much quicker than he. As I told\nyou before, I am something of a newspaper man myself; and if, with the\nfacilities of getting into any room in any house, in any city and in any\ncountry, and being with a suspected criminal night and day when he never\nimagines any one is near him--if with all those advantages I cannot\ndiscover the real author of that crime before George Stratton does, then\nI'll never admit that I came from Chicago, or belonged to a newspaper.\"\n\n\"Whom do you think Stratton suspects of the crime? He told the sheriff,\"\nsaid Brenton, \"that he had the name in his pocket-book.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Speed, \"but I have my suspicions. You see, he has\nthe names of all the guests at your banquet in that pocket-book of his;\nbut the name of Stephen Roland he has marked with two crosses. The name\nof the servant he has marked with one cross. Now, I suspect that he\nbelieves Stephen Roland committed the crime. You know Roland; what do\nyou think of him?\"\n\n\"I think he is quite capable of it,\" answered Brenton, with a frown.\n\n\"Still, you are prejudiced against the man,\" put in Speed, \"so your\nevidence is hardly impartial.\"\n\n\"I am not prejudiced against any one,\" answered Brenton; \"I merely know\nthat man. He is a thoroughly despicable, cowardly character. The only\nthing that makes me think he would not commit a murder, is that he is\ntoo craven to stand the consequences if he were caught. He is a cool\nvillain, but he is a coward. I do not believe he has the courage to\ncommit a crime, even if he thought he would benefit by it.\"\n\n\"Well, there is one thing, Brenton, you can't be accused of flattering\na man, and if it is any consolation for you to know, you may be pretty\ncertain that George Stratton is on his track.\"\n\n\"I am sure I wish him success,\" answered Brenton, gloomily; \"if he\nbrings Roland to the gallows I shall not mourn over it.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" said Speed; \"but now we must be up and doing\nourselves. Have you anything to propose?\"\n\n\"No, I have not, except that we might play the detective on Roland.\"\n\n\"Well, the trouble with that is we would merely be duplicating what\nStratton is doing himself. Now, I'll tell you my proposal. Supposing\nthat we consult with Lecocq.\"\n\n\"Who is that? The novelist?\"\n\n\"Novelist? I don't think he has ever written any novels--not that I\nremember of.\"\n\n\"Ah, I didn't know. It seemed to me that I remembered his name in\nconnection with some novel.\"\n\n\"Oh, very likely you did. He is the hero of more detective stories than\nany other man I know of. He was the great French detective.\"\n\n\"What, is he dead, then?\"\n\n\"Dead? Not a bit of it; he's here with us. Oh, I understand what you\nmean. Yes, from your point of view, he is dead.\"\n\n\"Where can we find him?\"\n\n\"Well, I presume, in Paris. He's a first-rate fellow to know, anyhow,\nand he spends most of his time around his old haunts. In fact, if you\nwant to be certain to find Lecocq, you will generally get him during\noffice hours in the room he used to frequent while in Paris.\"\n\n\"Let us go and see him, then.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Monsieur Lecocq,\" said Speed, a moment afterwards, \"I wish to introduce\nto you a new-comer, Mr. Brenton, recently of Cincinnati.\"\n\n\"Ah, my dear Speed,\" said the Frenchman, \"I am very pleased indeed to\nmeet any friend of yours. How is the great Chicago, the second Paris,\nand how is your circulation?--the greatest in the world, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Well, it is in pretty good order,\" said Speed; \"we circulated from\nChicago to Paris here in a very much shorter time than the journey\nusually occupies down below. Now, can you give us a little of your time?\nAre you busy just now?\"\n\n\"My dear Speed, I am always busy. I am like the people of the second\nParis. I lose no time, but I have always time to speak with my friends.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Speed. \"I am like the people of the second Chicago,\ngenerally more intent on pleasure than business; but, nevertheless, I\nhave a piece of business for you.\"\n\n\"The second Chicago?\" asked Lecocq. \"And where is that, pray?\"\n\n\"Why, Paris, of course,\" said Speed.\n\nLecocq laughed.\n\n\"You are incorrigible, you Chicagoans. And what is the piece of\nbusiness?\"\n\n\"It is the old thing, monsieur. A mystery to be unravelled. Mr. Brenton\nhere wishes to retain you in his case.\"\n\n\"And what is his case?\" was the answer.\n\nLecocq was evidently pleased to have a bit of real work given him.\n\n[Illustration: The detective.]\n\nSpeed briefly recited the facts, Brenton correcting him now and then\non little points where he was wrong. Speed seemed to think these points\nimmaterial, but Lecocq said that attention to trivialities was the\nwhole secret of the detective business.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Lecocq, sorrowfully, \"there is no real trouble in elucidating\nthat mystery. I hoped it would be something difficult; but, you see,\nwith my experience of the old world, and with the privileges one enjoys\nin this world, things which might be difficult to one below are very\neasy for us. Now, I shall show you how simple it is.\"\n\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Speed, \"you don't mean to say you are going to\nread it right off the reel, like that, when we have been bothering\nourselves with it so long, and without success?\"\n\n\"At the moment,\" replied the French detective, \"I am not prepared to say\nwho committed the deed. That is a matter of detail. Now, let us see what\nwe know, and arrive, from that, at what we do not know. The one fact, of\nwhich we are assured on the statement of two physicians from Cincinnati,\nis that Mr. Brenton was poisoned.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Speed, \"there are several other facts, too. Another fact is\nthat Mrs. Brenton is accused of the crime.\"\n\n\"Ah! my dear sir,\" said Lecocq, \"that is not pertinent.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Speed, \"I agree with you. I call it very impertinent.\"\n\nBrenton frowned, at this, and his old dislike to the flippant Chicago\nman rose to the surface again.\n\nThe Frenchman continued marking the points on his long forefinger.\n\n\"Now, there are two ways by which that result may have been attained.\nFirst, Mr. Brenton may have administered to himself the poison;\nsecondly, the poison may have been administered by some one else.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Speed; \"and, thirdly, the poison may have been administered\naccidentally--you do not seem to take that into account.\"\n\n\"I do not take that into account,\" calmly replied the Frenchman,\n\"because of its improbability. If there were an accident; if, for\ninstance, the poison was in the sugar, or in some of the viands served,\nthen others than Mr. Brenton would have been poisoned. The fact that one\nman out of twenty-six was poisoned, and the fact that several people are\nto benefit by his death, point, it seems to me, to murder; but to be\nsure of that, I will ask Mr. Brenton one question. My dear sir, did you\nadminister this poison to yourself?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" answered Brenton.\n\n\"Then we have two facts. First, Mr. Brenton was poisoned; secondly, he\nwas poisoned by some person who had an interest in his death. Now we\nwill proceed. When Mr. Brenton sat down to that dinner he was perfectly\nwell. When he arose from that dinner he was feeling ill. He goes to bed.\nHe sees no one but his wife after he has left the dinner-table, and he\ntakes nothing between the time he leaves the dinner-table and the moment\nhe becomes unconscious. Now, that poison must have been administered to\nMr. Brenton at the dinner-table. Am I not right?\"\n\n\"Well, you seem to be,\" answered Speed.\n\n\"Seem? Why, it is as plain as day. There cannot be any mistake.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Speed; \"go ahead. What next?\"\n\n\"What next? There were twenty-six people around that table, with two\nservants to wait on them, making twenty-eight in all. There were\ntwenty-six, I think you said, including Mr. Brenton.\"\n\n\"That is correct.\"\n\n\"Very well. One of those twenty-seven persons has poisoned Mr. Brenton.\nDo you follow me?\"\n\n\"We do,\" answered Speed; \"we follow you as closely as you have ever\nfollowed a criminal! Go on.\"\n\n\"Very well, so much is clear. These are all facts, not theories. Now,\nwhat is the thing that I should do if I were in Cincinnati? I would find\nout whether one or more of those guests had anything to gain by the\ndeath of their host. That done, I would follow the suspected persons. I\nwould have my men find out what each of them had done for a month before\nthe time of the crime. Whoever committed it made some preparation. He\ndid something, too, as you say, in America, to cover up his tracks. Very\nwell. By the keen detective these actions are easily traced. I shall at\nonce place twenty-seven of the best men I know on the track of those\ntwenty-seven persons.\"\n\n\"I call that shadowing with a vengeance,\" remarked the Chicago man.\n\n\"It will be very easy. The one who has committed the crime is certain,\nwhen he is alone in his own room, to say something, or to do something,\nthat will show my detective that he is the criminal. So, gentlemen, if\nyou can tell me who those twenty-seven persons are, in three days or a\nweek from this time I will tell you who gave the poison to Mr. Brenton.\"\n\n\"You seem very sure of that,\" said Speed.\n\n\"Sure of it? It is simply child's play. It is mere waiting. If, for\ninstance, at the trial Mrs. Brenton is found guilty, and sentenced, the\none who is the guilty party is certain to betray himself or herself\nas soon as he or she is alone. If it be a man who hopes to marry Mrs.\nBrenton, he will be overcome with grief at what has happened. He will\nwring his hands and try to think what can be done to prevent the\nsentence being carried out. He will argue with himself whether it is\nbetter to give himself up and tell the truth, and if he is a coward he\nwill conclude not to do that, but will try to get a pardon, or at least\nhave the capital sentence commuted into life imprisonment. He will\npossibly be cool and calm in public, but when he enters his own room,\nwhen his door is locked, when he believes no one can see him, when he\nthinks he is alone, then will come his trial. Then his passions and\nhis emotions will betray him. It is mere child's play, as I tell you,\nand long before there is a verdict I will give you the name of the\nmurderer.\"\n\n\"Very well, then,\" said Speed, \"that is agreed; we will look you up in a\nweek from now.\"\n\n\"I should be pained,\" said Lecocq, \"to put you to that trouble. As soon\nas I get the report from my men I will communicate with you and let\nyou know the result. In a few days I shall give you the name of the\nassassin.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, then, until I see you again,\" answered Speed; and with this\nhe and Brenton took their departure.\n\n\"He seems to be very sure of himself,\" said Brenton.\n\n[Illustration: Jane Morton.]\n\n\"He will do what he says, you may depend on that.\"\n\nThe week was not yet up when Monsieur Lecocq met John Speed in Chicago.\n\n\"By the look of satisfaction on your face,\" said Mr. Speed, \"I imagine\nyou have succeeded in unravelling the mystery.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" replied the Frenchman; \"if I have the appearance of satisfaction,\nit is indeed misplaced.\"\n\n\"Then you have not made any discovery?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, it is all as plain as your big buildings here. It\nis not for that reason, but because it is so simple that I should be\nfoolish to feel satisfaction regarding it.\"\n\n\"Then who is the person?\"\n\n\"The assassin,\" replied the Frenchman, \"is one whom no one has seemed to\nthink of, and yet one on whom suspicion should have been the first to\nfall. The person who did Monsieur Brenton the honour to poison him is\nnone other than the servant girl, Jane Morton.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\n\"Jane Morton!\" cried Speed; \"who is she?\"\n\n\"She is, as you may remember, the girl who carried the coffee from Mrs.\nBrenton to monsieur.\"\n\n\"And are you sure she is the criminal?\"\n\nThe great detective did not answer; he merely gave an expressive little\nFrench gesture, as though the question was not worth commenting upon.\n\n\"Why, what was her motive?\" asked Speed.\n\nFor the first time in their acquaintance a shade of perplexity seemed to\ncome over the enthusiastic face of the volatile Frenchman.\n\n\"You are what you call smart, you Chicago people,\" he said, \"and you\nhave in a moment struck the only point on which we are at a loss.\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" returned Speed, \"that is _the_ point in the case. Motive\nis the first thing to look for, it seems to me. You said as much\nyourself. If you haven't succeeded in finding what motive Jane Morton\nhad for poisoning her employer, it appears to me that very little has\nbeen accomplished.\"\n\n\"Ah, you say that before you know the particulars. I am certain we shall\nfind the motive. What I know now is that Jane Morton is the one who put\nthe poison in his cup of coffee.\"\n\n\"It would take a good deal of nerve to do that with twenty-six people\naround the table. You forget, my dear sir, that she had to pass the\nwhole length of the table, after taking the cup, before giving it to Mr.\nBrenton.\"\n\n\"Half of the people had their backs to her, and the other half, I can\nassure you, were not looking at her. If the poison was ready, it was a\nvery easy thing to slip it into a cup of coffee. There was ample time to\ndo it, and that is how it was done.\"\n\n\"May I ask how you arrived at that conclusion?\"\n\n\"Certainly, certainly, my dear sir. My detectives report that each one\nof the twenty-seven people they had to follow were shadowed night and\nday. But only two of them acted suspiciously. These two were Jane Morton\nand Stephen Roland. Stephen Roland's anxiety is accounted for by the\nfact that he is evidently in love with Mrs. Brenton. But the change\nin Jane Morton has been something terrible. She is suffering from the\nseverest pangs of ineffectual remorse. She has not gone out again to\nservice, but occupies a room in one of the poorer quarters of the\ncity--a room that she never leaves except at night. Her whole actions\nshow that she is afraid of the police--afraid of being tracked for her\ncrime. She buys a newspaper every night, locks and bars the door on\nentering her room, and, with tears streaming from her eyes, reads every\nword of the criminal news. One night, when she went out to buy her\npaper, and what food she needed for the next day, she came unexpectedly\nupon a policeman at the corner. The man was not looking at her at all,\nnor for her, but she fled, running like a deer, doubling and turning\nthrough alleys and back streets until by a very roundabout road she\nreached her own room. There she locked herself in, and remained\nwithout food all next day rather than go out again. She flung herself\nterror-stricken on the bed, after her room door was bolted, and cried,\n'Oh, why did I do it? why did I do it? I shall certainly be found out.\nIf Mrs. Brenton is acquitted, they will be after me next day. I did it\nto make up to John what he had suffered, and yet if John knew it, he\nwould never speak to me again.'\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Oh, why did I do it?\"]\n\n\"Who is John?\" asked Speed.\n\n\"Ah, that,\" said the detective, \"I do not know. When we find out who\nJohn is, then we shall find the motive for the crime.\"\n\n\"In that case, if I were you, I should try to find John as quickly as\npossible.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear sir, that is exactly what should be done, and my detective\nis now endeavouring to discover the identity of John. He will possibly\nsucceed in a few days. But there is another way of finding out who John\nis, and perhaps in that you can help me.\"\n\n\"What other way?\"\n\n\"There is one man who undoubtedly knows who John is, and that is Mr.\nBrenton. Now, I thought that perhaps you, who know Brenton better than I\ndo, would not mind asking him who John is.\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Speed, \"Brenton is no particular friend of mine,\nand I only know him well enough to feel that if there is any\ncross-examination to be done, I should prefer somebody else to do it.\"\n\n\"Why, you are not afraid of him, are you?\" asked the detective.\n\n\"Afraid of him? Certainly not, but I tell you that Brenton is just a\nlittle touchy and apt to take offence. I have found him so on several\noccasions. Now, as you have practically taken charge of this case, why\ndon't you go and see him?\"\n\n\"I suppose I shall have to do that,\" said the Frenchman, \"if you will\nnot undertake it.\"\n\n\"No, I will not.\"\n\n\"You have no objection, have you, to going with me?\"\n\n\"It is better for you to see Brenton alone. I do not think he would care\nto be cross-examined before witnesses, you know.\"\n\n\"Ah, then, good-bye; I shall find out from Mr. Brenton who John is.\"\n\n\"I am sure I wish you luck,\" replied Speed, as Lecocq took his\ndeparture.\n\nLecocq found Brenton and Ferris together. The cynical spirit seemed to\nhave been rather sceptical about the accounts given him of the influence\nthat Speed and Brenton, combined, had had upon the Chicago newspaper\nman. Yet he was interested in the case, and although he still maintained\nthat no practical good would result, even if a channel of communication\ncould be opened between the two states of existence, he had listened\nwith his customary respect to what Brenton had to say.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Brenton, when he saw the Frenchman, \"have you any news for\nme?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have. I have news that I will exchange, but meanwhile I want\nsome news from you.\"\n\n\"I have none to give you,\" answered Brenton.\n\n\"If you have not, will you undertake to answer any questions I shall ask\nyou, and not take offence if the questions seem to be personal ones?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Brenton; \"I shall be glad to answer anything as long\nas it has a bearing on the case.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, it has a very distinct bearing on the case. Do you\nremember the girl Jane Morton?\"\n\n\"I remember her, of course, as one of the servants in our employ. I know\nvery little about her, though.\"\n\n\"That is just what I wish to find out. Do you know _anything_ about her?\"\n\n\"No; she had been in our employ but a fortnight, I think, or perhaps it\nwas a month. My wife attended to these details, of course. I knew the\ngirl was there, that is all.\"\n\nThe Frenchman looked very dubious as Brenton said this, while the latter\nrather bridled up.\n\n\"You evidently do not believe me?\" he cried.\n\nOnce more the detective gave his customary gesture, and said--\n\n\"Ah, pardon me, you are entirely mistaken. I have this to acquaint you\nwith. Jane Morton is the one who murdered you. She did it, she says,\npartly for the sake of John, whoever he is, and partly out of revenge.\nNow, of course, you are the only man who can give me information as to\nthe motive. That girl certainly had a motive, and I should like to find\nout what the motive was.\"\n\nBrenton meditated for a few moments, and then suddenly brightened up.\n\n\"I remember, now, an incident which happened a week of two before\nChristmas, which may have a bearing on the case. One night I heard--or\nthought I heard--a movement downstairs, when I supposed everybody had\nretired. I took a revolver in my hand, and went cautiously down the\nstairs. Of course I had no light, because, if there was a burglar, I did\nnot wish to make myself too conspicuous a mark. As I went along the hall\nleading to the kitchen, I saw there was a light inside; but as soon as\nthey heard me coming the light was put out. When I reached the kitchen,\nI noticed a man trying to escape through the door that led to the\ncoalshed. I fired at him twice, and he sank to the floor with a groan. I\nthought I had bagged a burglar sure, but it turned out to be nothing of\nthe kind. He was merely a young man who had been rather late visiting\none of the girls. I suspect now the girl he came to see was Jane\nMorton. As it was, the noise brought the two girls there, and I never\ninvestigated the matter or tried to find out which one it was that he\nhad been visiting. They were both terror-stricken, and the young man\nhimself was in a state of great fear. He thought for a moment that he\nhad been killed. However, he was only shot in the leg, and I sent him to\nthe house of a physician who keeps such patients as do not wish to go to\nthe hospital. I did not care to have him go to the hospital, because I\nwas afraid the newspapers would get hold of the incident, and make\na sensation of it. The whole thing was accidental; the young fellow\nrealized that, and so, I thought, did the girls; at least, I never\nnoticed anything in their behaviour to show the contrary.\"\n\n\"What sort of a looking girl is Jane Morton?\" asked Ferris.\n\n\"She is a tall brunette, with snapping black eyes.\"\n\n\"Ah, then, I remember her going into the room where you lay,\" said\nFerris, \"on Christmas morning. It struck me when she came out that she\nwas very cool and self-possessed, and not at all surprised.\"\n\n\"All I can say,\" said Brenton, \"is that I never noticed anything in her\nconduct like resentment at what had happened. I intended to give the\nyoung fellow a handsome compensation for his injury, but of course what\noccurred on Christmas Eve prevented that: I had really forgotten all\nabout the circumstance, or I should have told you of it before.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Lecocq, \"the thing now is perfectly clear. That black-eyed\nvixen murdered you out of revenge.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\nIt was evident to George Stratton that he would have no time before\nthe trial came off in which to prove Stephen Roland the guilty person.\nBesides this, he was in a strange state of mind which he himself could\nnot understand. The moment he sat down to think out a plan by which\nhe could run down the man he was confident had committed the crime, a\nstrange wavering of mind came over him. Something seemed to say to him\nthat he was on the wrong track. This became so persistent that George\nwas bewildered, and seriously questioned his own sanity. Whenever he sat\nalone in his own room, the doubts arose and a feeling that he was on the\nwrong scent took possession of him. This feeling became so strong at\ntimes that he looked up other clues, and at one time tried to find\nout the whereabouts of the servant girls who had been employed by the\nBrentons. Curiously enough, the moment he began this search, his mind\nseemed to become clearer and easier; and when that happened, the old\nbelief in the guilt of Stephen Roland resumed its sway again. But the\ninstant he tried to follow up what clues he had in that direction, he\nfound himself baffled and assailed again by doubts, and so every effort\nhe put forth appeared to be nullified. This state of mind was so unusual\nwith him that he had serious thoughts of abandoning the whole case and\ngoing back to Chicago. He said to himself, \"I am in love with this woman\nand I shall go crazy if I stay here any longer.\" Then he remembered the\ntrust she appeared to have in his powers of ferreting out the mystery of\nthe case, and this in turn encouraged him and urged him on.\n\nAll trace of the girls appeared to be lost. He hesitated to employ a\nCincinnati detective, fearing that what he discovered would be given\naway to the Cincinnati press. Then he accused himself of disloyalty to\nMrs. Brenton, in putting his newspaper duty before his duty to her.\nHe was so torn by his conflicting ideas and emotions that at last he\nresolved to abandon the case altogether and return to Chicago. He packed\nup his valise and resolved to leave that night for big city, trial or no\ntrial. He had described his symptoms to a prominent physician, and that\nphysician told him that the case was driving him mad, and the best thing\nhe could do was to leave at once for other scenes. He could do no good,\nand would perhaps end by going insane himself.\n\nAs George Stratton was packing his valise in his room, alone, as he\nthought, the following conversation was taking place beside him.\n\n\"It is no use,\" said Speed; \"we are merely muddling him, and not doing\nany good. The only thing is to leave him alone. If he investigates the\nRoland part of the case he will soon find out for himself that he is on\nthe wrong track; then he will take the right one.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Brenton; \"but the case comes on in a few days. If anything\nis to be done, it must be done now.\"\n\n\"In that I do not agree with you,\" said Speed. \"Perhaps everything will\ngo all right at the trial, but even if it does not, there is still\na certain amount of time. You see how we have spoiled things by\ninterfering. Our first success with him has misled us. We thought we\ncould do anything; we have really done worse than nothing, because all\nthis valuable time has been lost. If he had been allowed to proceed in\nhis own way he would have ferreted out the matter as far as Stephen\nRoland is concerned, and would have found that there was no cause for\nhis suspicion. As it is he has done nothing. He still believes, if left\nalone, that Stephen Roland is the criminal. All our efforts to lead him\nto the residence of Jane Morton have been unavailing. Now, you see, he\nis on the eve of going back to Chicago.\"\n\n\"Well, then, let him go,\" said Brenton, despondently.\n\n\"With all my heart, say I,\" answered Speed; \"but in any case let us\nleave him alone.\"\n\nBefore the train started that night Stratton said to himself that he was\na new man. Richard was himself again. He was thoroughly convinced of the\nguilt of Stephen Roland, and wondered why he had allowed his mind to\nwander off the topic and waste time with other suspicions, for which\nhe now saw there was no real excuse. He had not the time, he felt, to\ninvestigate the subject personally, but he flattered himself he knew\nexactly the man to put on Roland's track, and, instead of going himself\nto Chicago, he sent off the following despatch:--\n\n\"Meet me to-morrow morning, without fail, at the Gibson House. Answer.\"\n\nBefore midnight he had his answer, and next morning he met a man in whom\nhe had the most implicit confidence, and who had, as he said, the rare\nand valuable gift of keeping his mouth shut.\n\n\"You see this portrait?\" Stratton said, handing to the other a\nphotograph of Stephen Roland. \"Now, I do not know how many hundred\nchemist shops there are in Cincinnati, but I want you to get a list of\nthem, and you must not omit the most obscure shop in town. I want you to\nvisit every drug store there is in the city, show this photograph to the\nproprietor and the clerks, and find out if that man bought any chemicals\nduring the week or two preceding Christmas. Find out what drugs he\nbought, and where he bought them, then bring the information to me.\"\n\n\"How much time do you give me on this, Mr. Stratton?\" was the question.\n\n\"Whatever time you want. I wish the thing done thoroughly and\ncompletely, and, as you know, silence is golden in a case like this.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"How much time do you give me?\"]\n\n\"Enough said,\" replied the other, and, buttoning the photograph in his\ninside pocket, he left the room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere is no necessity of giving an elaborate report of the trial. Any\none who has curiosity in the matter can find the full particulars from\nthe files of any paper in the country. Mrs. Brenton was very pale as she\nsat in the prisoner's dock, but George Stratton thought he never saw any\none look so beautiful. It seemed to him that any man in that crowded\ncourtroom could tell in a moment that she was not guilty of the crime\nwith which she was charged, and he looked at the jury of twelve\nsupposedly good men, and wondered what they thought of it.\n\n[Illustration: In the prisoner's dock.]\n\nThe defence claimed that it was not their place to show who committed\nthe murder. That rested with the prosecution. The prosecution, Mr.\nBenham maintained, had signally failed to do this. However, in order to\naid the prosecution, he was quite willing to show how Mr. Brenton came\nto his death. Then witnesses were called, who, to the astonishment of\nMrs. Brenton, testified that her husband had all along had a tendency to\ninsanity. It was proved conclusively that some of his ancestors had died\nin a lunatic asylum, and one was stated to have committed suicide. The\ndefence produced certain books from Mr. Brenton's library, among them\nForbes Winslow's volume on \"The Mind and the Brain,\" to show that\nBrenton had studied the subject of suicide.\n\nThe judge's charge was very colourless. It amounted simply to this:\nIf the jury thought the prosecution had shown Mrs. Brenton to have\ncommitted the crime, they were to bring in a verdict of guilty, and if\nthey thought otherwise they were to acquit her; and so the jury retired.\n\nAs they left the court-room a certain gloom fell upon all those who were\nfriendly to the fair prisoner.\n\nDespite the great reputation of Benham and Brown, it was the thought\nof every one present that they had made a very poor defence. The\nprosecution, on the other hand, had been most ably conducted. It had\nbeen shown that Mrs. Brenton was chiefly to profit by her husband's\ndeath. The insurance fund alone would add seventy-five thousand dollars\nto the money she would control. A number of little points that Stratton\nhad given no heed to had been magnified, and appeared then to have a\ngreat bearing on the case. For the first time, Stratton admitted\nto himself that the prosecution had made out a very strong case of\ncircumstantial evidence. The defence, too, had been so deplorably weak\nthat it added really to the strength of the prosecution. A great speech\nhad been expected of Benham, but he did not rise to the occasion, and,\nas one who knew him said, Benham evidently believed his client guilty.\n\nAs the jury retired, every one in the court-room felt that there was\nlittle hope for the prisoner; and this feeling was intensified when, a\nfew moments after, the announcement was made in court, just as the\njudge was preparing to leave the bench, that the jury had agreed on the\nverdict.\n\nStratton, in the stillness of the court-room, heard one lawyer whisper\nto another, \"She's doomed.\"\n\nThere was intense silence as the jury slowly filed into their places,\nand the foreman stood up.\n\n\"Gentlemen of the jury,\" was the question, \"have you agreed upon a\nverdict?\"\n\n\"We have,\" answered the foreman.\n\n\"Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?\"\n\n\"Not guilty,\" was the clear answer.\n\nAt this there was first a moment of silence, and then a ripple of\napplause, promptly checked.\n\nMrs. Brenton was free.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\nGeorge Stratton sat in the court-room for a moment dazed, before he\nthought of the principal figure in the trial; then he rose to go to her\nside, but he found that Roland was there before him. He heard her say,\n\"Get me a carriage quickly, and take me away from here.\"\n\nSo Stratton went back to his hotel to meet his Chicago detective. The\nlatter had nothing to report. He told him the number of drug stores he\nhad visited, but all without avail. No one had recognized the portrait.\n\n\"All right,\" said Stratton; \"then you will just have to go ahead until\nyou find somebody who does. It is, I believe, only a question of time\nand perseverance.\"\n\nNext morning he arose late. He looked over the report of the trial in\nthe morning paper, and then, turning to the leader page, read with\nrising indignation the following editorial:--\n\n\"THE BRENTON CASE.\n\n\"The decision of yesterday shows the glorious uncertainty that attends\nthe finding of the average American jury. If such verdicts are to be\nrendered, we may as well blot out from the statute-book all punishment\nfor all crimes in which the evidence is largely circumstantial. If ever\na strong case was made out against a human being it was the case of the\nprosecution in the recent trial. If ever there was a case in which the\ndefence was deplorably weak, although ably conducted, it was the case\nthat was concluded yesterday. Should we, then, be prepared to say that\ncircumstantial evidence will not be taken by an American jury as ground\nfor the conviction of a murderer? The chances are that, if we draw this\nconclusion, we shall be entirely wrong. If a man stood in the dock, in\nthe place of the handsome young woman who occupied it yesterday, he\nwould to-day have been undoubtedly convicted of murder. The conclusion,\nthen, to be arrived at seems to be that, unless there is the direct\nproof of murder against a pretty woman, it is absolutely impossible\nto get the average jury of men to convict her. It would seem that the\nsooner we get women on juries, especially where a woman is on trial, the\nbetter it will be for the cause of justice.\"\n\nThen in other parts of the paper there were little items similar to this--\n\n\"If Mrs. Brenton did not poison her husband, then who did?\"\n\nThat afternoon George Stratton paid a visit to Mrs. Brenton. He had\nhoped she had not seen the paper in question, but he hoped in vain. He\nfound Mrs. Brenton far from elated with her acquittal.\n\n\"I would give everything I possess,\" she said, \"to bring the culprit to\njustice.\"\n\nAfter a talk on that momentous question, and when George Stratton held\nher hand and said good-bye, she asked him--\n\n\"When do you go to Chicago?\"\n\n\"Madam,\" he said, \"I leave for Chicago the moment I find out who\npoisoned William Brenton.\"\n\nShe answered sadly--\n\n\"You may remain a long time in Cincinnati.\"\n\n\"In some respects,\" said Stratton, \"I like Cincinnati better than\nChicago.\"\n\n\"You are the first Chicago man I ever heard say that,\" she replied.\n\n\"Ah, that was because they did not know Cincinnati as I do.\"\n\n\"I suppose you must have seen a great deal of the town, but I must\nconfess that from now on I should be very glad if I never saw Cincinnati\nagain. I would like to consult with you,\" she continued, \"about the best\nway of solving this mystery. I have been thinking of engaging some of\nthe best detectives I can get. I suppose New York would be the place.\"\n\n\"No; Chicago,\" answered the young man.\n\n\"Well, then, that is what I wanted to see you about. I would like to get\nthe very best detectives that can be had. Don't you think that, if they\nwere promised ample reward, and paid well during the time they were\nworking on the case, we might discover the key to this mystery?\"\n\n\"I do not think much of our detective system,\" answered Stratton,\n\"although I suppose there is something in it, and sometimes they manage\nin spite of themselves to stumble on the solution of a crime. Still, I\nshall be very glad indeed to give you what advice I can on the subject.\nI may say I have constituted myself a special detective in this case,\nand that I hope to have the honour of solving the problem.\"\n\n\"You are very good, indeed,\" she answered, \"and I must ask you to let me\nbear the expense.\"\n\n\"Oh, the paper will do that. I won't be out of pocket at all,\" said\nStratton.\n\n\"Well, I hardly know how to put it; but, whether you are successful or\nnot, I feel very grateful to you, and I hope you will not be offended at\nwhat I am going to say. Now, promise me that you won't!\"\n\n\"I shall not be offended,\" he answered. \"It is a little difficult to\noffend a Chicago newspaper man, you know.\"\n\n\"Now, you mustn't say anything against the newspaper men, for, in spite\nof the hard things that some of them have said about me, I like them.\"\n\n\"Individually or collectively?\"\n\n[Illustration: \"I feel very grateful to you.\"]\n\n\"I am afraid I must say individually. You said you wouldn't be offended,\nso after your search is over you must let me----. The labourer is worthy\nof his hire, or I should say, his reward--you know what I mean. I presume\nthat a young man who earns his living on the daily press is not\nnecessarily wealthy.\"\n\n\"Why, Mrs. Brenton, what strange ideas you have of the world! We\nnewspaper men work at the business merely because we like it. It isn't\nat all for the money that's in it.\"\n\n\"Then you are not offended at what I have said?\"\n\n\"Oh, not in the least. I may say, however, that I look for a higher\nreward than money if I am successful in this search.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am sure you do,\" answered the lady, innocently. \"If you\nsucceed in this, you will be very famous.\"\n\n\"Exactly; it's fame I'm after,\" said Stratton, shaking her hand once\nmore, and taking his leave.\n\nWhen he reached his hotel, he found the Chicago detective waiting for\nhim.\n\n\"Well, old man,\" he said, \"anything new?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Something very new.\"\n\n\"What have you found out?\"\n\n\"Everything.\"\n\n\"Very well, let me have it.\"\n\n\"I found out that this man bought, on December 10th, thirty grains of\nmorphia. He had this morphia put up in five-grain capsules. He bought\nthis at the drug store on the corner of Blank Street and Nemo Avenue.\"\n\n\"Good gracious!\" answered Stratton. \"Then to get morphia he must have\nhad a physician's certificate. Did you find who the physician was that\nsigned the certificate?\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said the Chicago man, \"this person is himself a\nphysician, unless I am very much mistaken. I was told that this was the\nportrait of Stephen Roland. Am I right?\"\n\n\"That is the name.\"\n\n\"Well, then, he is a doctor himself. Not doing a very large practice, it\nis true, but he is a physician. Did you not know that?\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Here's the detailed report.\"]\n\n\"No,\" said Stratton; \"how stupid I am! I never thought of asking the\nman's occupation.\"\n\n\"Very well, if that is what you wanted to know, here's the detailed\nreport of my investigation.\"\n\nWhen the man left, Stratton rubbed his hands.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Stephen Roland, I have you,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nAfter receiving this information Stratton sat alone in his room and\nthought deeply over his plans. He did not wish to make a false step, yet\nthere was hardly enough in the evidence he had secured to warrant his\ngiving Stephen Roland up to the police. Besides this, it would put the\nsuspected man at once on his guard, and there was no question but\nthat gentleman had taken every precaution to prevent discovery. After\ndeliberating for a long while, he thought that perhaps the best thing he\ncould do was to endeavour to take Roland by surprise. Meanwhile, before\nthe meditating man stood Brenton and Speed, and between them there was a\nserious disagreement of opinion.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I tell you what it is,\" said Speed, \"there is no use in our interfering\nwith Stratton. He is on the wrong track, but, nevertheless, all the\ninfluence we can use on him in his present frame of mind will merely do\nwhat it did before--it will muddle the man up. Now, I propose that we\nleave him severely alone. Let him find out his mistake. He will find it\nout in some way or other, and then he will be in a condition of mind to\nturn to the case of Jane Morton.\"\n\n\"But don't you see,\" argued Brenton, \"that all the time spent on his\npresent investigation is so much time lost? I will agree to leave him\nalone, as you say, but let us get somebody else on the Morton case.\"\n\n\"I don't want to do that,\" said Speed; \"because George Stratton has\ntaken a great deal of interest in this search. He has done a great deal\nnow, and I think we should he grateful to him for it.\"\n\n\"Grateful!\" growled Brenton; \"he has done it from the most purely\nselfish motives that a man can act upon. He has done it entirely for his\npaper--for newspaper fame. He has done it for money.\"\n\n\"Now,\" said Speed, hotly, \"you must not talk like that of Stratton to\nme. I won't say what I think of that kind of language coming from you,\nbut you can see how seriously we interfered with his work before, and\nhow it nearly resulted in his departure for Chicago. I propose now that\nwe leave him alone.\"\n\n\"Leave him alone, then, for any sake,\" replied Brenton; \"I am sure I\nbuild nothing on what he can do anyway.\"\n\n\"All right, then,\" returned Speed, recovering his good nature. \"Now,\nalthough I am not willing to put any one else on the track of Miss Jane\nMorton, yet I will tell you what I am willing to do. If you like, we\nwill go to her residence, and influence her to confess her crime. I\nbelieve that can be done.\"\n\n\"Very well; I want you to understand that I am perfectly reasonable\nabout the matter. All I want is not to lose any more time.\"\n\n\"Time?\" cried Speed; \"why, we have got all the time there is. Mrs.\nBrenton is acquitted. There is no more danger.\"\n\n\"That is perfectly true, I admit; but still you can see the grief under\nwhich she labours, because her name is not yet cleared from the odium\nof the crime. You will excuse me, Speed, if I say that you seem to be\nworking more in the interests of Stratton's journalistic success than in\nthe interests of Mrs. Brenton's good name.\"\n\n\"Well, we won't talk about that,\" said Speed; \"Stratton is amply able to\ntake care of himself, as you will doubtless see. Now, what do you say\nto our trying whether or not we can influence Jane Morton to do what she\nought to do, and confess her crime?\"\n\n\"It is not a very promising task,\" replied Brenton; \"it is hard to get a\nperson to say words that may lead to the gallows.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure about that,\" said Speed; \"you know the trouble of mind\nshe is in. I think it more than probable that, after the terror of the\nlast few weeks, it will be a relief for her to give herself up.\"\n\n\"Very well; let us go.\"\n\nThe two men shortly afterwards found themselves in the scantily\nfurnished room occupied by Jane Morton. That poor woman was rocking\nherself to and fro and moaning over her trouble. Then she suddenly\nstopped rocking, and looked around the room with vague apprehension\nin her eyes. She rose and examined the bolts of the door, and, seeing\neverything was secure, sat down again.\n\n\"I shall never have any peace in this world again,\" she cried to\nherself.\n\nShe rocked back and forth silently for a few moments.\n\n\"I wish,\" she said, \"the police would find out all about it, and then\nthis agony of mind would end.\"\n\nAgain she rocked back and forth, with her hands helplessly in her lap.\n\n\"Oh, I cannot do it, _I cannot do it_!\" she sobbed, still rocking to and\nfro. Finally she started to her feet.\n\n\"I _will_ do it,\" she cried; \"I will confess to Mrs. Brenton herself. I\nwill tell her everything. She has gone through trouble herself, and may\nhave mercy on me.\"\n\n\"There, you see,\" said Speed to Brenton, \"we have overcome the\ndifficulty, after all.\"\n\n\"It certainly looks like it,\" replied Brenton. \"Don't you think,\nhowever, that we had better stay with her until she _does_ confess? May\nshe not change her mind?\"\n\n\"Don't let us overdo the thing,\" suggested Speed; \"if she doesn't, come\nto time, we can easily have another interview with her. The woman's\nmind is made up. She is in torment, and will be until she confesses her\ncrime. Let us go and leave her alone.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGeorge Stratton was not slow to act when he had once made up his mind.\nHe pinned to the breast of his vest a little shield, on which was the\nword \"detective.\" This he had often found useful, in a way that is not\nat all sanctioned by the law, in ferreting out crime in Chicago. As soon\nas it was evening he paced up and down in front of Roland's house, and\non the opposite side of the road. There was a light in the doctor's\nstudy, and he thought that perhaps the best way to proceed was to go\nboldly into the house and put his scheme into operation. However, as he\nmeditated on this, the light was turned low, and in a few moments the\ndoor opened. The doctor came down the steps, and out on the pavement,\nwalking briskly along the street. The reporter followed him on the other\nside of the thoroughfare. Whether to do it in the dark or in the light,\nwas the question that troubled Stratton. If he did it in the dark, he\nwould miss the expression on the face of the surprised man. If he did it\nin the light, the doctor might recognize him as the Chicago reporter,\nand would know at once that he was no detective. Still, he felt that\nif there was anything in his scheme at all, it was surprise; and he\nremembered the quick gasp of the lawyer Brown when he told him he knew\nwhat his defence was. He must be able to note the expression of the man\nwho was guilty of the terrible crime.\n\nHaving made up his mind to this, he stepped smartly after the doctor,\nand, when the latter came under a lamp-post, placed his hand suddenly on\nhis shoulder, and exclaimed--\n\n\"Doctor Stephen Roland, I arrest you for the murder of William Brenton!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\nStephen Roland turned quietly around and shook the hand from his\nshoulder. It was evident that he recognized Stratton instantly.\n\n\"Is this a Chicago joke?\" asked the doctor.\n\n\"If it is, Mr. Roland, I think you will find it a very serious one.\"\n\n\"Aren't you afraid that _you_ may find it a serious one?\"\n\n\"I don't see why I should have any fears in the premises,\" answered the\nnewspaper man.\n\n\"My dear sir, do you not realize that I could knock you down or shoot\nyou dead for what you have done, and be perfectly justified in doing\nso?\"\n\n\"If you either knock or shoot,\" replied the other, \"you will have to do\nit very quickly, for, in the language of the wild and woolly West, I've\ngot the drop on you. In my coat pocket is a cocked revolver with my\nforefinger on the trigger. If you make a hostile move I can let daylight\nthrough you so quickly that you won't know what has struck you.\"\n\n\"Electric light, I think you mean,\" answered the doctor, quietly. \"Even\na Chicago man might find it difficult to let daylight through a person\nat this time in the evening. Now, this sort of thing may be Chicago\nmanners, but I assure you it will not go down here in Cincinnati. You\nhave rendered yourself liable to the law if I cared to make a point of\nit, but I do not. Come back with me to my study. I would like to talk\nwith you.\"\n\nStratton began to feel vaguely that he had made a fool of himself. His\nscheme had utterly failed. The doctor was a great deal cooler and more\ncollected than he was. Nevertheless, he had a deep distrust of the\ngentleman, and he kept his revolver handy for fear the other would make\na dash to escape him. They walked back without saying a word to each\nother until they came to the doctor's office. Into the house they\nentered, and the doctor bolted the door behind them. Stratton suspected\nthat very likely he was walking into a trap, but he thought he would\nbe equal to any emergency that might arise. The doctor walked into the\nstudy, and again locked the door of that. Pulling down the blinds, he\nturned up the gas to its full force and sat down by a table, motioning\nthe newspaper man to a seat on the other side.\n\n\"Now,\" he said calmly to Stratton, \"the reason I did not resent your\nunwarrantable insult is this: You are conscientiously trying to get at\nthe root of this mystery. So am I. Your reason is that you wish to score\na victory for your paper. My motive is entirely different, but our\nobject is exactly the same. Now, by some strange combination of\ncircumstances you have come to the conclusion that I committed the\ncrime. Am I right?\"\n\n\"You are perfectly correct, doctor,\" replied Stratton.\n\n\"Very well, then. Now, I assure you that I am entirely innocent. Of\ncourse, I appreciate the fact that this assurance will not in the\nslightest degree affect your opinion, but I am interested in knowing why\nyou came to your conclusion, and perhaps by putting our heads together,\neven if I dislike you and you hate me, we may see some light on this\nmatter that has hitherto been hidden. I presume you have no objection at\nall to co-operate with me?\"\n\n\"None in the least,\" was the reply.\n\n\"Very well, then. Now, don't mind my feelings at all, but tell me\nexactly why you have suspected me of being a murderer.\"\n\n\"Well,\" answered Stratton, \"in the first place we must look for a\nmotive. It seems to me that you have a motive for the crime.\"\n\n\"And might I ask what that motive is, or was?\"\n\n\"You will admit that you disliked Brenton?\"\n\n\"I will admit that, yes.\"\n\n\"Very well. You will admit also that you were--well, how shall I put\nit?--let us say, interested in his wife before her marriage?\"\n\n\"I will admit that; yes.\"\n\n\"You, perhaps, will admit that you are interested in her now?\"\n\n\"I do not see any necessity for admitting that; but still, for the\npurpose of getting along with the case, I will admit it. Go on.\"\n\n\"Very good. Here is a motive for the crime, and a very strong one.\nFirst, we will presume that you are in love with the wife of the man\nwho is murdered. Secondly, supposing that you are mercenary, quite\na considerable amount of money will come to you in case you marry\nBrenton's widow. Next, some one at that table poisoned him. It was not\nMrs. Brenton, who poured out the cup of coffee. The cup of coffee was\nplaced before Brenton, and my opinion is that, until it was placed\nthere, there was no poison in that cup. The doomed man was entirely\nunsuspicious, and therefore it was very easy for a person to slip enough\npoison in that cup unseen by anybody at that table, so that when he\ndrank his coffee nothing could have saved him. He rose from the table\nfeeling badly, and he went to his room and died. Now, who could have\nplaced that poison in his cup of coffee? It must have been one of the\ntwo that sat at his right and left hand. A young lady sat at his right\nhand. She certainly did not commit the crime. You, Stephen Roland, sat\nat his left hand. Do you deny any of the facts I have recited?\"\n\n\"That is a very ingenious chain of circumstantial evidence. Of course,\nyou do not think it strong enough to convict a man of such a serious\ncrime as murder?\"\n\n\"No; I quite realize the weakness of the case up to this point. But\nthere is more to follow. Fourteen days before that dinner you purchased\nat the drug store on the corner of Blank Street and Nemo Avenue thirty\ngrains of morphia. You had the poison put up in capsules of five\ngrains each. What do you say to that bit of evidence added to the\ncircumstantial chain which you say is ingenious?\"\n\nThe doctor knit his brows and leaned back in his chair.\n\n\"By the gods!\" he said, \"you are right. I did buy that morphia. I\nremember it now. I don't mind telling you that I had a number of\nexperiments on hand, as every doctor has, and I had those capsules put\nup at the drug store, but this tragedy coming on made me forget all\nabout the matter.\"\n\n\"Did you take the morphia with you, doctor?\"\n\n\"No, I did not. And the box of capsules, I do not think, has been\nopened. But that is easily ascertained.\"\n\nThe doctor rose, went to his cabinet, and unlocked it. From a number of\npackages he selected a small one, and brought it to the desk, placing it\nbefore the reporter.\n\n\"There is the package. That contains, as you say, thirty grains of\nmorphia in half a dozen five-grain capsules. You see that it is sealed\njust as it left the drug store. Now, open it and look for yourself. Here\nare scales; if you want to see whether a single grain is missing or not,\nfind out for yourself.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said the newspaper man, \"we had better leave this\ninvestigation for the proper authorities.\"\n\n\"Then you still believe that I am the murderer of William Brenton?\"\n\n\"Yes, I still believe that.\"\n\n\"Very well; you may do as you please. I think, however, in justice\nto myself, you should stay right here, and see that this box is not\ntampered with until the proper authorities, as you say, come.\"\n\nThen, placing his hand on the bell, he continued--\"Whom shall I send\nfor? An ordinary policeman, or some one from the central office? But,\nnow that I think of it, here is a telephone. We can have any one brought\nhere that you wish. I prefer that neither you nor I leave this room\nuntil that functionary has appeared. Name the authority you want brought\nhere,\" said the doctor, going to the telephone, \"and I will have him\nhere if he is in town.\"\n\nThe newspaper man was nonplussed. The Doctor's actions did not seem like\nthose of a guilty man. If he were guilty he certainly had more nerve\nthan any person Stratton had ever met. So he hesitated. Then he said--\n\n\"Sit down a moment, doctor, and let us talk this thing over.\"\n\n\"Just as you say,\" remarked Roland, drawing up his chair again.\n\nStratton took the package, and looked it over carefully. It was\ncertainly just in the condition in which it had left the drug store; but\nstill, that could have been easily done by the doctor himself.\n\n\"Suppose we open this package?\" he said to Roland.\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said the doctor, \"go ahead;\" and he shoved over to\nhim a little penknife that was on the table.\n\nThe reporter took the package, ran the knife around the edge, and opened\nit. There lay six capsules, filled, as the doctor had said. Roland\npicked up one of them, and looked at it critically.\n\n\"I assure you,\" he said, \"although I am quite aware you do not believe a\nword I say, that I have not seen those capsules before.\"\n\nHe drew towards him a piece of paper, opened the capsule, and, let the\nwhite powder fall on the paper. He looked critically at the powder, and\na shade of astonishment came over his face. He picked up the penknife,\ntook a particle on the tip of it, and touched it with his tongue.\n\n\"Don't fool with that thing!\" said Stratton.\n\n\"Oh, my dear fellow,\" he said, \"morphia is not a poison in small\nquantities.\"\n\nThe moment he had tasted it, however, he suddenly picked up the paper,\nput the five grains on his tongue, and swallowed them.\n\nInstantly the reporter sprang to his feet. He saw at once the reason for\nall the assumed coolness. The doctor was merely gaining time in order to\ncommit suicide.\n\n\"What have you done?\" cried the reporter.\n\n\"Done, my dear fellow? nothing very much. This is not morphia; it is\nsulphate of quinine.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n\nIn the morning Jane Morton prepared to meet Mrs. Brenton, and make her\nconfession. She called at the Brenton residence, but found it closed,\nas it had been ever since the tragedy of Christmas morning. It took her\nsome time to discover the whereabouts of Mrs. Brenton, who, since the\nmurder, had resided with a friend except while under arrest.\n\nFor a moment Mrs. Brenton did not recognize the thin and pale woman who\nstood before her in a state of such extreme nervous agitation, that it\nseemed as if at any moment she might break down and cry.\n\n\"I don't suppose you'll remember me, ma'am,\" began the girl, \"but I\nworked for you two weeks before--before----\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Mrs. Brenton, \"I remember you now. Have you been ill? You\nlook quite worn and pale, and very different from what you did the last\ntime I saw you.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the girl, \"I believe I have been ill.\".\n\n\"You _believe_; aren't you sure?\"\n\n\"I have been very ill in mind, and troubled, and that is the reason I\nlook so badly,--Oh, Mrs. Brenton, I wanted to tell you of something that\nhas been weighing on my mind ever since that awful day! I know you can\nnever forgive me, but I must tell it to you, or I shall go crazy.\"\n\n\"Sit down, sit down,\" said the lady, kindly; \"you know what trouble I\nhave been in myself. I am sure that I am more able to sympathize now\nwith one who is in trouble than ever I was before.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am; but you were innocent, and I am guilty. That makes all the\ndifference in the world.\"\n\n\"Guilty!\" cried Mrs. Brenton, a strange fear coming over her as she\nstared at the girl; \"guilty of _what_?\"\n\n\"Oh, madam, let me tell you all about it. There is, of course, no\nexcuse; but I'll begin at the beginning. You remember a while before\nChristmas that John came to see me one night, and we sat up very late in\nthe kitchen, and your husband came down quietly, and when we heard him\ncoming we put out the light and just as John was trying to get away,\nyour husband shot twice at him, and hit him the second time?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Mrs. Brenton, \"I remember that very well. I had forgotten\nabout it in my own trouble; but I know that my husband intended to do\nsomething for the young man. I hope he was not seriously hurt?\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Guilty! Guilty of what?\"]\n\n\"No, ma'am; he is able to be about again now as well as ever, and is not\neven lame, which we expected he would be. But at the time I thought he\nwas going to be lame all the rest of his life, and perhaps that is the\nreason I did what I did. When everything was in confusion in the house,\nand it was certain that we would all have to leave, I did a very wicked\nthing. I went to your room, and I stole some of your rings, and some\nmoney that was there, as well as a lot of other things that were in the\nroom. It seemed to me then, although, of course, I know now how wicked\nit was, that you owed John something for what he had gone through, and\nI thought that he was to be lame, and that you would never miss the\nthings; but, oh! madam, I have not slept a night since I took them. I\nhave been afraid of the police and afraid of being found out. I have\npawned nothing, and they are all just as I took them, and I have brought\nthem back here to you, with every penny of the money. I know you can\nnever forgive me, but I am willing now to be given up to the police,\nand I feel better in my mind than I have done ever since I took\nthe things.\"\n\n\"My poor child!\" said Mrs. Brenton, sympathetically, \"was that _all_?\"\n\n\"All?\" cried the girl. \"Yes, I have brought everything back.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't mean that, but I am sorry you have been worried over\nanything so trivial. I can see how at such a time, and feeling that you\nhad been wronged, a temptation to take the things came to you. But I\nhope you will not trouble any more about the matter. I will see that\nJohn is compensated for all the injury he received, as far as it is\npossible for money to compensate him. I hope you will keep the money.\nThe other things, of course, I shall take back, and I am glad you came\nto tell me of it before telling any one else. I think, perhaps, it is\nbetter never to say anything to anybody about this. People might not\nunderstand just what temptation you were put to, and they would not know\nthe circumstances of the case, because nobody knows, I think, that John\nwas hurt. Now, my dear girl, do not cry. It is all right. Of course you\nnever will touch anything again that does not belong to you, and the\nsuffering you have gone through has more than made up for all the wrong\nyou have done. I am sure that I forgive you quite freely for it, and I\nthink it was very noble of you to come and tell me about it.\"\n\nMrs. Brenton took the package from the hands of the weeping girl, and\nopened it. She found everything there, as the girl had said. She took\nthe money and offered it to Jane Morton. The girl shook her head.\n\n\"No,\" she cried, \"I cannot touch it. I cannot, indeed. It has been\nenough misery to me already.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Mrs. Brenton. \"I would like very much to see John.\nWill you bring him to me?\"\n\nThe girl looked at her with startled eyes.\n\n\"You will not tell him?\" she said.\n\n\"No indeed, I shall tell him nothing. But I want to do what I can for\nhim as I said. I suppose you are engaged to be married?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the girl; \"but if he knew of this he never, never would\nmarry me.\"\n\n\"If he did not,\" said Mrs. Brenton, \"he would not be worthy of you. But\nhe shall know nothing about it. You will promise to come here and see me\nwith him, will you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" said the girl.\n\n\"Then good-bye, until I see you again.\"\n\nMrs. Brenton sat for a long time thinking over this confession. It took\nher some time to recover her usual self-possession, because for a moment\nshe had thought the girl was going to confess that she committed murder.\nIn comparison with that awful crime, the theft seemed so trivial that\nMrs. Brenton almost smiled when she thought of the girl's distress.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well,\" said John Speed to Mr. Brenton, \"if that doesn't beat the Old\nHarry. Now I, for one, am very glad of it, if we come to the real truth\nof the matter.\"\n\n\"I am glad also,\" said Brenton, \"that the girl is not guilty, although I\nmust say things looked decidedly against her.\"\n\n\"I will tell you why I am glad,\" said Speed. \"I am glad because it\nwill take some of the superfluous conceit out of that French detective\nLecocq. He was so awfully sure of himself. He couldn't possibly be\nmistaken. Now, think of the mistakes that man must have made while he\nwas on earth, and had the power which was given into his hands in Paris.\nAfter all, Stratton is on the right track, and he will yet land your\nfriend Roland in prison. Let us go and find Lecocq. This is too good to\nkeep.\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Brenton, \"you seem to be more elated because of your\nfriend Stratton than for any other reason. Don't you want the matter\nferreted out at all?\"\n\n\"Why, certainly I do; but I don't want it ferreted out by bringing an\ninnocent person into trouble.\"\n\n\"And may not Stephen Roland be an innocent person?\"\n\n\"Oh, I suppose so; but I do not think he is.\"\n\n\"Why do you not think so?\"\n\n\"Well, if you want the real reason, simply because George Stratton\nthinks he isn't. I pin my faith to Stratton.\"\n\n\"I think you overrate your friend Stratton.\"\n\n\"Overrate him, sir? That is impossible. I love him so well that I hope\nhe will solve this mystery himself, unaided and alone, and that in going\nback to Chicago he will be smashed to pieces in a railway accident, so\nthat we can have him here to congratulate him.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Roland, \"you thought for a moment I was trying to\ncommit suicide. I think, Mr. Stratton, you will have a better opinion of\nme by-and-by. I shouldn't be at all surprised if you imagined I induced\nyou to come in here to get you into a trap.\"\n\n\"You are perfectly correct,\" said Stratton; \"and I may say, although\nthat was my belief, I was not in the least afraid of you, for I had you\ncovered all the time.\"\n\n\"Well,\" remarked Roland, carelessly, \"I don't want to interfere with\nyour business at all, but I wish you wouldn't cover me quite so much;\nthat revolver of yours might go off.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say,\" said Stratton, \"that there is nothing but quinine\nin those capsules?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you in a moment,\" as he opened them one by one. \"No, there is\nnothing but quinine here. Thirty grains put up in five-grain capsules.\"\n\nGeorge Stratton's eyes began to open. Then he slowly rose, and looked\nwith horrified face at the doctor.\n\n\"My God!\" he cried; \"who got the thirty grains of morphia?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked the doctor.\n\n\"Mean? Why, don't you see it? It is a chemist's mistake. Thirty grains\nof quinine have been sent you. Thirty grains of morphia have been sent\nto somebody else. Was it to William Brenton?\"\n\n\"By Jove!\" said the doctor, \"there's something in that. Say, let us go\nto the drug store.\"\n\nThe two went out together, and walked to the drug store on the corner of\nBlank Street and Nemo Avenue.\n\n\"Do you know this writing?\" said Doctor Roland to the druggist, pointing\nto the label on the box.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the druggist; \"that was written by one of my\nassistants.\"\n\n\"Can we see him for a few moments?\"\n\n\"I don't know where he is to be found. He is a worthless fellow, and has\ngone to the devil this last few weeks with a rapidity that is something\nstartling.\"\n\n\"When did he leave?\"\n\n\"Well, he got drunk and stayed drunk during the holidays, and I had to\ndischarge him. He was a very valuable man when he was sober; but he\nbegan to be so erratic in his habits that I was afraid he would make a\nghastly mistake some time, so I discharged him before it was too late.\"\n\n\"Are you sure you discharged him before it was too late?\"\n\nThe druggist looked at the doctor, whom he knew well, and said, \"I never\nheard of any mistake, if he did make it.\"\n\n\"You keep a book, of course, of all the prescriptions sent out?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"May we look at that book?\"\n\n\"I shall be very glad to show it to you. What month or week?\"\n\n\"I want to see what time you sent this box of morphia to me.\"\n\n\"You don't know about what time it was, do you?\n\n\"Yes; it must have been about two weeks before Christmas.\"\n\nThe chemist looked over the pages of the book, and finally said, \"Here\nit is.\"\n\n\"Will you let me look at that page?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nThe doctor ran his finger down the column, and came to an entry written\nin the same hand.\n\n\"Look here,\" he said to Stratton, \"thirty grains of quinine sent to\nWilliam Brenton, and next to it thirty grains of morphia sent to Stephen\nRoland. I see how it was. Those prescriptions were mixed up. My package\nwent to poor Brenton.\"\n\nThe druggist turned pale.\n\n\"I hope,\" he said, \"nothing public will come of this.\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Roland, \"something public will _have_ to come of\nit. You will oblige me by ringing up the central police station, as this\nbook must be given in charge of the authorities.\"\n\n\"Look here,\" put in Stratton, his newspaper instinct coming uppermost,\n\"I want to get this thing exclusively for the _Argus_.\"\n\n\"Oh, I guess there will be no trouble about that. Nothing will be made\npublic until to-morrow, and you can telegraph to-night if we find the\nbox of capsules in Brenton's residence. We must take an officer with us\nfor that purpose, but you can caution or bribe him to keep quiet until\nto-morrow.\"\n\nWhen the three went to William Brenton's residence they began a search\nof the room in which Brenton had died, but nothing was found. In the\ncloset of the room hung the clothes of Brenton, and going through them\nStratton found in the vest pocket of one of the suits a small box\ncontaining what was described as five-grain capsules of sulphate of\nquinine. The doctor tore one of these capsules apart, so as to see what\nwas in it. Without a moment's hesitation he said--\n\n\"There you are! That is the morphia. There were six capsules in this\nbox, and one of them is missing. William Brenton poisoned himself!\nFeeling ill, he doubtless took what he thought was a dose of quinine.\nMany men indulge in what we call the quinine habit. It is getting to be\na mild form of tippling. Brenton committed unconscious suicide!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n\nA group of men; who were really alive, but invisible to the searchers,\nstood in the room where the discovery was made. Two of the number were\nevidently angry, one in one way and one in another. The rest of the\ngroup appeared to be very merry. One angry man was Brenton himself, who\nwas sullenly enraged. The other was the Frenchman, Lecocq, who was as\ndeeply angered as Brenton, but, instead of being sullen, was exceedingly\nvoluble.\n\n\"I tell you,\" he cried, \"it is not a mistake of mine. I went on correct\nprinciples from the first. I was misled by one who should have known\nbetter. You will remember, gentlemen,\" he continued, turning first to\none and then the other, \"that what I said was that we had certain facts\nto go on. One of those facts I got from Mr. Brenton. I said to him in\nyour presence, 'Did you poison yourself?' He answered me, as I can prove\nby all of you, 'No, I did not.' I took that for a fact. I thought I was\nspeaking to a reasonable man who knew what he was talking about.\"\n\n\"Haven't I told you time and again,\" answered Brenton, indignantly,\n\"that it was a mistake? You asked me if I poisoned myself. I answered\nyou that I did not. Your question related to suicide. I did _not_ commit\nsuicide. I was the victim of a druggist's mistake. If you had asked me\nif I had taken medicine before I went to bed, I should have told you\nfrankly, 'Yes. I took one capsule of quinine.' It has been my habit for\nyears, when I feel badly. I thought nothing of that.\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Lecocq, \"I warned you, and I warned these gentlemen,\nthat the very things that seem trivial to a thoughtless person are the\nthings that sometimes count. You should have told me _everything_. If\nyou took anything at all, you should have said so. If you had said to\nme, 'Monsieur Lecocq, before I retired I took five grains of quinine,'\nI should have at once said; 'Find where that quinine is, and see if it\n_is_ quinine, and see if there has not been a mistake.' I was entirely\nmisled; I was stupidly misled.\"\n\n\"Well, if there was stupidity,\" returned Brenton, \"it was your own.\"\n\n\"Come, come, gentlemen,\" laughed Speed, \"all's well that ends well.\nEverybody has been mistaken, that's all about it. The best detective\nminds of Europe and America, of the world, and of the spirit-land, have\nbeen misled. You are _all_ wrong. Admit it, and let it end.\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Lecocq, \"I shall not admit anything. I was not\nwrong; I was misled. It was this way----\"\n\n\"Oh, now, for goodness' sake don't go over it all again. We understand\nthe circumstances well enough.\"\n\n\"I tell you,\" cried Brenton, in an angry tone, \"that----\n\n\"Come, come,\" said Speed, \"we have had enough of this discussion. I tell\nyou that you are all wrong, every one of you. Come with me, Brenton, and\nwe will leave this amusing crowd.\"\n\n\"I shall do nothing of the kind,\" answered Brenton, shortly.\n\n\"Oh, very well then, do as you please. I am glad the thing is ended, and\nI am glad it is ended by my Chicago friend.\"\n\n\"Your Chicago friend!\" sneered Brenton, slightingly; \"It was discovered\nby Doctor Stephen Roland.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said Speed, \"Stephen Roland had all his time to\ndiscover the thing, and didn't do it, and never would have done it, if\nGeorge Stratton hadn't encountered him. Well, good-bye, gentlemen; I am\nsorry to say that I have had quite enough of this discussion. But one\nthing looms up above it all, and that is that Chicago is ahead of the\nworld in everything--in detection as well as in fires.\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" cried Lecocq, \"it is not true. I will show you in a\nmoment--\"\n\n\"You won't show _me_,\" said Speed, and he straightway disappeared.\n\n\"Come, Ferris,\" said Brenton, \"after all, you are the only friend I seem\nto have; come with me.\"\n\n\"Where are you going?\" asked Ferris, as they left.\n\n\"I want to see how my wife takes the news.\"\n\n\"Don't,\" said Mr. Ferris--\"don't do anything of the kind. Leave matters\njust where they are. Everything has turned out what you would call all\nright. You see that your interference, as far as it went, was perfectly\nfutile and useless. I want now to draw your attention to other things.\"\n\n\"Very well, I will listen to you,\" said Brenton, \"if you come with me\nand see how my wife takes the news. I want to enjoy for even a moment or\ntwo her relief and pleasure at finding that her good name is clear.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" assented Ferris, \"I will go with you.\"\n\nWhen they arrived they found the Chicago reporter ahead of them. He had\nevidently told Mrs. Brenton all the news, and her face flushed with\neager pleasure as she listened to the recital.\n\n\"Now,\" said the Chicago man, \"I am going to leave Cincinnati. Are you\nsorry I am going?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mrs. Brenton, looking him in the face, \"I am not sorry.\"\n\nStratton flushed at this, and then said, taking his hat in his hand,\n\"Very well, madam, I shall bid you good day.\"\n\n\"I am not sorry,\" said Mrs. Brenton, holding out her hand, \"because I\nam going to leave Cincinnati myself, and I hope never to see the city\nagain. So if you stayed here, you see, I should never meet you again,\nMr. Stratton.\"\n\n\"Alice,\" cried Stratton, impulsively grasping her hand in both of his,\n\"don't you think you would like Chicago as a place of residence?\"\n\n\"George,\" she answered, \"I do not know. I am going to Europe, and shall\nbe there for a year or two.\"\n\nThen he said eagerly--\n\n\"When you return, or if I go over there to see you after a year or two,\nmay I ask you that question again?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" was the whispered answer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Come,\" said Brenton to Ferris, \"let us go.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FROM WHOSE BOURNE***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 9312-8.txt or 9312-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/9\/3\/1\/9312\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n","id":393,"split":"train"}
