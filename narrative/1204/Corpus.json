John Meredith is a widower with four young children: Gerald (Jerry), Faith, Una, and Thomas Carlyle (Carl). The children have not been properly brought up since the death of their mother, with only their father (who is easily absorbed by matters of theology) to parent them. The children are considered wild and mischievous by many of the families in the village (who tend only to hear about the Meredith children when they have gotten into some kind of scrape), causing them to question Mr. Meredith's parenting skills and his suitability as a minister.\nFor most of the book, only the Blythes know of the Meredith children's loyalty and kindness. They rescue an orphaned girl, Mary Vance, from starvation, and Una finds a home for her with Mrs. Marshall Elliott. When the children get into trouble, Faith sometimes tries to explain their behavior to the townsfolk, which generally causes an even bigger scandal.\nThe Merediths, Blythes, and Mary Vance often play in a hollow called Rainbow Valley, which becomes a gathering place for the children in the book. Jem Blythe tries to help the Merediths behave better by forming the \"Good-Conduct Club,\" in which the Merediths punish themselves for misdeeds. Their self-imposed punishments lead to Carl becoming very ill with pneumonia after spending hours in a graveyard on a wet night, and to Una fainting in church after fasting all day. When this happens, John Meredith is wracked with guilt over his failings as a father.\nMr. Meredith realizes that he should marry again and give the children a mother, though he has always thought he will never love anyone again as he did his late wife. He is surprised to find that he has fallen in love with Rosemary West, a woman in her late thirties who lives with her sister Ellen, who is ten years older. John proposes marriage to Rosemary, but Ellen forbids Rosemary from accepting, as years earlier they had promised each other never to leave the other following the deaths of their parents. However, Ellen eventually reunites with her childhood beau, Norman Douglas, and asks Rosemary to release her from her promise so she can marry Norman. Rosemary agrees, but now thinks that John Meredith hates her.\nUna overhears her father expressing feelings for Rosemary and goes to ask Rosemary to marry her father despite her misgivings about stepmothers, who Mary Vance has told her are always mean. Rosemary sets her mind at ease and agrees to speak to John Meredith again. They become engaged, and Rosemary and Ellen plan a double wedding in the fall.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Rainbow Valley, by Lucy Maud Montgomery\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

HOME AGAIN\n\nIt was a clear, apple-green evening in May, and Four Winds Harbour was\nmirroring back the clouds of the golden west between its softly dark\nshores. The sea moaned eerily on the sand-bar, sorrowful even in spring,\nbut a sly, jovial wind came piping down the red harbour road along which\nMiss Cornelia's comfortable, matronly figure was making its way towards\nthe village of Glen St. Mary. Miss Cornelia was rightfully Mrs. Marshall\nElliott, and had been Mrs. Marshall Elliott for thirteen years, but even\nyet more people referred to her as Miss Cornelia than as Mrs.\nElliott. The old name was dear to her old friends, only one of them\ncontemptuously dropped it. Susan Baker, the gray and grim and faithful\nhandmaiden of the Blythe family at Ingleside, never lost an opportunity\nof calling her \"Mrs. Marshall Elliott,\" with the most killing and\npointed emphasis, as if to say \"You wanted to be Mrs. and Mrs. you shall\nbe with a vengeance as far as I am concerned.\"\n\nMiss Cornelia was going up to Ingleside to see Dr. and Mrs. Blythe, who\nwere just home from Europe. They had been away for three months, having\nleft in February to attend a famous medical congress in London; and\ncertain things, which Miss Cornelia was anxious to discuss, had taken\nplace in the Glen during their absence. For one thing, there was a new\nfamily in the manse. And such a family! Miss Cornelia shook her head\nover them several times as she walked briskly along.\n\nSusan Baker and the Anne Shirley of other days saw her coming, as they\nsat on the big veranda at Ingleside, enjoying the charm of the cat's\nlight, the sweetness of sleepy robins whistling among the twilit maples,\nand the dance of a gusty group of daffodils blowing against the old,\nmellow, red brick wall of the lawn.\n\nAnne was sitting on the steps, her hands clasped over her knee, looking,\nin the kind dusk, as girlish as a mother of many has any right to be;\nand the beautiful gray-green eyes, gazing down the harbour road, were\nas full of unquenchable sparkle and dream as ever. Behind her, in the\nhammock, Rilla Blythe was curled up, a fat, roly-poly little creature\nof six years, the youngest of the Ingleside children. She had curly red\nhair and hazel eyes that were now buttoned up after the funny, wrinkled\nfashion in which Rilla always went to sleep.\n\nShirley, \"the little brown boy,\" as he was known in the family \"Who's\nWho,\" was asleep in Susan's arms. He was brown-haired, brown-eyed and\nbrown-skinned, with very rosy cheeks, and he was Susan's especial\nlove. After his birth Anne had been very ill for a long time, and Susan\n\"mothered\" the baby with a passionate tenderness which none of the other\nchildren, dear as they were to her, had ever called out. Dr. Blythe had\nsaid that but for her he would never have lived.\n\n\"I gave him life just as much as you did, Mrs. Dr. dear,\" Susan was wont\nto say. \"He is just as much my baby as he is yours.\" And, indeed, it was\nalways to Susan that Shirley ran, to be kissed for bumps, and rocked\nto sleep, and protected from well-deserved spankings. Susan had\nconscientiously spanked all the other Blythe children when she thought\nthey needed it for their souls' good, but she would not spank Shirley\nnor allow his mother to do it. Once, Dr. Blythe had spanked him and\nSusan had been stormily indignant.\n\n\"That man would spank an angel, Mrs. Dr. dear, that he would,\" she had\ndeclared bitterly; and she would not make the poor doctor a pie for\nweeks.\n\nShe had taken Shirley with her to her brother's home during his parents'\nabsence, while all the other children had gone to Avonlea, and she had\nthree blessed months of him all to herself. Nevertheless, Susan was very\nglad to find herself back at Ingleside, with all her darlings around her\nagain. Ingleside was her world and in it she reigned supreme. Even Anne\nseldom questioned her decisions, much to the disgust of Mrs. Rachel\nLynde of Green Gables, who gloomily told Anne, whenever she visited Four\nWinds, that she was letting Susan get to be entirely too much of a boss\nand would live to rue it.\n\n\"Here is Cornelia Bryant coming up the harbour road, Mrs. Dr. dear,\"\nsaid Susan. \"She will be coming up to unload three months' gossip on\nus.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Anne, hugging her knees. \"I'm starving for Glen St.\nMary gossip, Susan. I hope Miss Cornelia can tell me everything that\nhas happened while we've been away--EVERYTHING--who has got born, or\nmarried, or drunk; who has died, or gone away, or come, or fought, or\nlost a cow, or found a beau. It's so delightful to be home again with\nall the dear Glen folks, and I want to know all about them. Why, I\nremember wondering, as I walked through Westminster Abbey which of her\ntwo especial beaux Millicent Drew would finally marry. Do you know,\nSusan, I have a dreadful suspicion that I love gossip.\"\n\n\"Well, of course, Mrs. Dr. dear,\" admitted Susan, \"every proper woman\nlikes to hear the news. I am rather interested in Millicent Drew's case\nmyself. I never had a beau, much less two, and I do not mind now, for\nbeing an old maid does not hurt when you get used to it. Millicent's\nhair always looks to me as if she had swept it up with a broom. But the\nmen do not seem to mind that.\"\n\n\"They see only her pretty, piquant, mocking, little face, Susan.\"\n\n\"That may very well be, Mrs. Dr. dear. The Good Book says that favour is\ndeceitful and beauty is vain, but I should not have minded finding that\nout for myself, if it had been so ordained. I have no doubt we will\nall be beautiful when we are angels, but what good will it do us then?\nSpeaking of gossip, however, they do say that poor Mrs. Harrison Miller\nover harbour tried to hang herself last week.\"\n\n\"Oh, Susan!\"\n\n\"Calm yourself, Mrs. Dr. dear. She did not succeed. But I really do not\nblame her for trying, for her husband is a terrible man. But she was\nvery foolish to think of hanging herself and leaving the way clear for\nhim to marry some other woman. If I had been in her shoes, Mrs. Dr.\ndear, I would have gone to work to worry him so that he would try\nto hang himself instead of me. Not that I hold with people hanging\nthemselves under any circumstances, Mrs. Dr. dear.\"\n\n\"What is the matter with Harrison Miller, anyway?\" said Anne\nimpatiently. \"He is always driving some one to extremes.\"\n\n\"Well, some people call it religion and some call it cussedness, begging\nyour pardon, Mrs. Dr. dear, for using such a word. It seems they cannot\nmake out which it is in Harrison's case. There are days when he\ngrowls at everybody because he thinks he is fore-ordained to eternal\npunishment. And then there are days when he says he does not care and\ngoes and gets drunk. My own opinion is that he is not sound in his\nintellect, for none of that branch of the Millers were. His grandfather\nwent out of his mind. He thought he was surrounded by big black spiders.\nThey crawled over him and floated in the air about him. I hope I shall\nnever go insane, Mrs. Dr. dear, and I do not think I will, because it is\nnot a habit of the Bakers. But, if an all-wise Providence should decree\nit, I hope it will not take the form of big black spiders, for I loathe\nthe animals. As for Mrs. Miller, I do not know whether she really\ndeserves pity or not. There are some who say she just married Harrison\nto spite Richard Taylor, which seems to me a very peculiar reason\nfor getting married. But then, of course, _I_ am no judge of things\nmatrimonial, Mrs. Dr. dear. And there is Cornelia Bryant at the gate, so\nI will put this blessed brown baby on his bed and get my knitting.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. SHEER GOSSIP\n\n\"Where are the other children?\" asked Miss Cornelia, when the first\ngreetings--cordial on her side, rapturous on Anne's, and dignified on\nSusan's--were over.\n\n\"Shirley is in bed and Jem and Walter and the twins are down in their\nbeloved Rainbow Valley,\" said Anne. \"They just came home this afternoon,\nyou know, and they could hardly wait until supper was over before\nrushing down to the valley. They love it above every spot on earth. Even\nthe maple grove doesn't rival it in their affections.\"\n\n\"I am afraid they love it too well,\" said Susan gloomily. \"Little Jem\nsaid once he would rather go to Rainbow Valley than to heaven when he\ndied, and that was not a proper remark.\"\n\n\"I suppose they had a great time in Avonlea?\" said Miss Cornelia.\n\n\"Enormous. Marilla does spoil them terribly. Jem, in particular, can do\nno wrong in her eyes.\"\n\n\"Miss Cuthbert must be an old lady now,\" said Miss Cornelia, getting out\nher knitting, so that she could hold her own with Susan. Miss Cornelia\nheld that the woman whose hands were employed always had the advantage\nover the woman whose hands were not.\n\n\"Marilla is eighty-five,\" said Anne with a sigh. \"Her hair is\nsnow-white. But, strange to say, her eyesight is better than it was when\nshe was sixty.\"\n\n\"Well, dearie, I'm real glad you're all back. I've been dreadful\nlonesome. But we haven't been dull in the Glen, believe ME. There hasn't\nbeen such an exciting spring in my time, as far as church matters go.\nWe've got settled with a minister at last, Anne dearie.\"\n\n\"The Reverend John Knox Meredith, Mrs. Dr. dear,\" said Susan, resolved\nnot to let Miss Cornelia tell all the news.\n\n\"Is he nice?\" asked Anne interestedly.\n\nMiss Cornelia sighed and Susan groaned.\n\n\"Yes, he's nice enough if that were all,\" said the former. \"He is VERY\nnice--and very learned--and very spiritual. But, oh Anne dearie, he has\nno common sense!\n\n\"How was it you called him, then?\"\n\n\"Well, there's no doubt he is by far the best preacher we ever had in\nGlen St. Mary church,\" said Miss Cornelia, veering a tack or two. \"I\nsuppose it is because he is so moony and absent-minded that he never got\na town call. His trial sermon was simply wonderful, believe ME. Every\none went mad about it--and his looks.\"\n\n\"He is VERY comely, Mrs. Dr. dear, and when all is said and done, I DO\nlike to see a well-looking man in the pulpit,\" broke in Susan, thinking\nit was time she asserted herself again.\n\n\"Besides,\" said Miss Cornelia, \"we were anxious to get settled. And Mr.\nMeredith was the first candidate we were all agreed on. Somebody had\nsome objection to all the others. There was some talk of calling Mr.\nFolsom. He was a good preacher, too, but somehow people didn't care for\nhis appearance. He was too dark and sleek.\"\n\n\"He looked exactly like a great black tomcat, that he did, Mrs. Dr.\ndear,\" said Susan. \"I never could abide such a man in the pulpit every\nSunday.\"\n\n\"Then Mr. Rogers came and he was like a chip in porridge--neither harm\nnor good,\" resumed Miss Cornelia. \"But if he had preached like Peter and\nPaul it would have profited him nothing, for that was the day old Caleb\nRamsay's sheep strayed into church and gave a loud 'ba-a-a' just as he\nannounced his text. Everybody laughed, and poor Rogers had no chance\nafter that. Some thought we ought to call Mr. Stewart, because he was so\nwell educated. He could read the New Testament in five languages.\"\n\n\"But I do not think he was any surer than other men of getting to heaven\nbecause of that,\" interjected Susan.\n\n\"Most of us didn't like his delivery,\" said Miss Cornelia, ignoring\nSusan. \"He talked in grunts, so to speak. And Mr. Arnett couldn't preach\nAT ALL. And he picked about the worst candidating text there is in the\nBible--'Curse ye Meroz.'\"\n\n\"Whenever he got stuck for an idea, he would bang the Bible and shout\nvery bitterly, 'Curse ye Meroz.' Poor Meroz got thoroughly cursed that\nday, whoever he was, Mrs. Dr. dear,\" said Susan.\n\n\"The minister who is candidating can't be too careful what text he\nchooses,\" said Miss Cornelia solemnly. \"I believe Mr. Pierson would have\ngot the call if he had picked a different text. But when he announced 'I\nwill lift my eyes to the hills' HE was done for. Every one grinned, for\nevery one knew that those two Hill girls from the Harbour Head have been\nsetting their caps for every single minister who came to the Glen for\nthe last fifteen years. And Mr. Newman had too large a family.\"\n\n\"He stayed with my brother-in-law, James Clow,\" said Susan. \"'How many\nchildren have you got?' I asked him. 'Nine boys and a sister for each of\nthem,' he said. 'Eighteen!' said I. 'Dear me, what a family!' And then\nhe laughed and laughed. But I do not know why, Mrs. Dr. dear, and I am\ncertain that eighteen children would be too many for any manse.\"\n\n\"He had only ten children, Susan,\" explained Miss Cornelia, with\ncontemptuous patience. \"And ten good children would not be much worse\nfor the manse and congregation than the four who are there now. Though\nI wouldn't say, Anne dearie, that they are so bad, either. I like\nthem--everybody likes them. It's impossible to help liking them. They\nwould be real nice little souls if there was anyone to look after their\nmanners and teach them what is right and proper. For instance, at school\nthe teacher says they are model children. But at home they simply run\nwild.\"\n\n\"What about Mrs. Meredith?\" asked Anne.\n\n\"There's NO Mrs. Meredith. That is just the trouble. Mr. Meredith is\na widower. His wife died four years ago. If we had known that I don't\nsuppose we would have called him, for a widower is even worse in\na congregation than a single man. But he was heard to speak of his\nchildren and we all supposed there was a mother, too. And when they came\nthere was nobody but old Aunt Martha, as they call her. She's a cousin\nof Mr. Meredith's mother, I believe, and he took her in to save her from\nthe poorhouse. She is seventy-five years old, half blind, and very deaf\nand very cranky.\"\n\n\"And a very poor cook, Mrs. Dr. dear.\"\n\n\"The worst possible manager for a manse,\" said Miss Cornelia bitterly.\n\"Mr. Meredith won't get any other housekeeper because he says it would\nhurt Aunt Martha's feelings. Anne dearie, believe me, the state of that\nmanse is something terrible. Everything is thick with dust and nothing\nis ever in its place. And we had painted and papered it all so nice\nbefore they came.\"\n\n\"There are four children, you say?\" asked Anne, beginning to mother them\nalready in her heart.\n\n\"Yes. They run up just like the steps of a stair. Gerald's the oldest.\nHe's twelve and they call him Jerry. He's a clever boy. Faith is eleven.\nShe is a regular tomboy but pretty as a picture, I must say.\"\n\n\"She looks like an angel but she is a holy terror for mischief, Mrs. Dr.\ndear,\" said Susan solemnly. \"I was at the manse one night last week and\nMrs. James Millison was there, too. She had brought them up a dozen eggs\nand a little pail of milk--a VERY little pail, Mrs. Dr. dear. Faith\ntook them and whisked down the cellar with them. Near the bottom of the\nstairs she caught her toe and fell the rest of the way, milk and eggs\nand all. You can imagine the result, Mrs. Dr. dear. But that child came\nup laughing. 'I don't know whether I'm myself or a custard pie,' she\nsaid. And Mrs. James Millison was very angry. She said she would never\ntake another thing to the manse if it was to be wasted and destroyed in\nthat fashion.\"\n\n\"Maria Millison never hurt herself taking things to the manse,\"\nsniffed Miss Cornelia. \"She just took them that night as an excuse for\ncuriosity. But poor Faith is always getting into scrapes. She is so\nheedless and impulsive.\"\n\n\"Just like me. I'm going to like your Faith,\" said Anne decidedly.\n\n\"She is full of spunk--and I do like spunk, Mrs. Dr. dear,\" admitted\nSusan.\n\n\"There's something taking about her,\" conceded Miss Cornelia. \"You never\nsee her but she's laughing, and somehow it always makes you want\nto laugh too. She can't even keep a straight face in church. Una is\nten--she's a sweet little thing--not pretty, but sweet. And Thomas\nCarlyle is nine. They call him Carl, and he has a regular mania for\ncollecting toads and bugs and frogs and bringing them into the house.\"\n\n\"I suppose he was responsible for the dead rat that was lying on a chair\nin the parlour the afternoon Mrs. Grant called. It gave her a turn,\"\nsaid Susan, \"and I do not wonder, for manse parlours are no places for\ndead rats. To be sure it may have been the cat who left it, there. HE is\nas full of the old Nick as he can be stuffed, Mrs. Dr. dear. A manse cat\nshould at least LOOK respectable, in my opinion, whatever he really\nis. But I never saw such a rakish-looking beast. And he walks along the\nridgepole of the manse almost every evening at sunset, Mrs. Dr. dear,\nand waves his tail, and that is not becoming.\"\n\n\"The worst of it is, they are NEVER decently dressed,\" sighed Miss\nCornelia. \"And since the snow went they go to school barefooted.\nNow, you know Anne dearie, that isn't the right thing for manse\nchildren--especially when the Methodist minister's little girl always\nwears such nice buttoned boots. And I DO wish they wouldn't play in the\nold Methodist graveyard.\"\n\n\"It's very tempting, when it's right beside the manse,\" said Anne. \"I've\nalways thought graveyards must be delightful places to play in.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, you did not, Mrs. Dr. dear,\" said loyal Susan, determined to\nprotect Anne from herself. \"You have too much good sense and decorum.\"\n\n\"Why did they ever build that manse beside the graveyard in the first\nplace?\" asked Anne. \"Their lawn is so small there is no place for them\nto play except in the graveyard.\"\n\n\"It WAS a mistake,\" admitted Miss Cornelia. \"But they got the lot cheap.\nAnd no other manse children ever thought of playing there. Mr. Meredith\nshouldn't allow it. But he has always got his nose buried in a book,\nwhen he is home. He reads and reads, or walks about in his study in a\nday-dream. So far he hasn't forgotten to be in church on Sundays, but\ntwice he has forgotten about the prayer-meeting and one of the elders\nhad to go over to the manse and remind him. And he forgot about Fanny\nCooper's wedding. They rang him up on the 'phone and then he rushed\nright over, just as he was, carpet slippers and all. One wouldn't\nmind if the Methodists didn't laugh so about it. But there's one\ncomfort--they can't criticize his sermons. He wakes up when he's in the\npulpit, believe ME. And the Methodist minister can't preach at all--so\nthey tell me. _I_ have never heard him, thank goodness.\"\n\nMiss Cornelia's scorn of men had abated somewhat since her marriage,\nbut her scorn of Methodists remained untinged of charity. Susan smiled\nslyly.\n\n\"They do say, Mrs. Marshall Elliott, that the Methodists and\nPresbyterians are talking of uniting,\" she said.\n\n\"Well, all I hope is that I'll be under the sod if that ever comes to\npass,\" retorted Miss Cornelia. \"I shall never have truck or trade with\nMethodists, and Mr. Meredith will find that he'd better steer clear of\nthem, too. He is entirely too sociable with them, believe ME. Why,\nhe went to the Jacob Drews' silver-wedding supper and got into a nice\nscrape as a result.\"\n\n\"What was it?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Drew asked him to carve the roast goose--for Jacob Drew never did\nor could carve. Well, Mr. Meredith tackled it, and in the process he\nknocked it clean off the platter into Mrs. Reese's lap, who was sitting\nnext him. And he just said dreamily. 'Mrs. Reese, will you kindly return\nme that goose?' Mrs. Reese 'returned' it, as meek as Moses, but she must\nhave been furious, for she had on her new silk dress. The worst of it\nis, she was a Methodist.\"\n\n\"But I think that is better than if she was a Presbyterian,\" interjected\nSusan. \"If she had been a Presbyterian she would mostly likely have left\nthe church and we cannot afford to lose our members. And Mrs. Reese is\nnot liked in her own church, because she gives herself such great airs,\nso that the Methodists would be rather pleased that Mr. Meredith spoiled\nher dress.\"\n\n\"The point is, he made himself ridiculous, and _I_, for one, do not like\nto see my minister made ridiculous in the eyes of the Methodists,\"\nsaid Miss Cornelia stiffly. \"If he had had a wife it would not have\nhappened.\"\n\n\"I do not see if he had a dozen wives how they could have prevented Mrs.\nDrew from using up her tough old gander for the wedding-feast,\" said\nSusan stubbornly.\n\n\"They say that was her husband's doing,\" said Miss Cornelia. \"Jacob Drew\nis a conceited, stingy, domineering creature.\"\n\n\"And they do say he and his wife detest each other--which does not\nseem to me the proper way for married folks to get along. But then, of\ncourse, I have had no experience along that line,\" said Susan, tossing\nher head. \"And _I_ am not one to blame everything on the men. Mrs. Drew\nis mean enough herself. They say that the only thing she was ever known\nto give away was a crock of butter made out of cream a rat had fell\ninto. She contributed it to a church social. Nobody found out about the\nrat until afterwards.\"\n\n\"Fortunately, all the people the Merediths have offended so far are\nMethodists,\" said Miss Cornelia. \"That Jerry went to the Methodist\nprayer-meeting one night about a fortnight ago and sat beside old\nWilliam Marsh who got up as usual and testified with fearful groans. 'Do\nyou feel any better now?' whispered Jerry when William sat down. Poor\nJerry meant to be sympathetic, but Mr. Marsh thought he was impertinent\nand is furious at him. Of course, Jerry had no business to be in a\nMethodist prayer-meeting at all. But they go where they like.\"\n\n\"I hope they will not offend Mrs. Alec Davis of the Harbour Head,\" said\nSusan. \"She is a very touchy woman, I understand, but she is very well\noff and pays the most of any one to the salary. I have heard that she\nsays the Merediths are the worst brought up children she ever saw.\"\n\n\"Every word you say convinces me more and more that the Merediths belong\nto the race that knows Joseph,\" said Mistress Anne decidedly.\n\n\"When all is said and done, they DO,\" admitted Miss Cornelia. \"And that\nbalances everything. Anyway, we've got them now and we must just do the\nbest we can by them and stick up for them to the Methodists. Well, I\nsuppose I must be getting down harbour. Marshall will soon be home--he\nwent over-harbour to-day--and wanting his super, man-like. I'm sorry I\nhaven't seen the other children. And where's the doctor?\"\n\n\"Up at the Harbour Head. We've only been home three days and in that\ntime he has spent three hours in his own bed and eaten two meals in his\nown house.\"\n\n\"Well, everybody who has been sick for the last six weeks has been\nwaiting for him to come home--and I don't blame them. When that\nover-harbour doctor married the undertaker's daughter at Lowbridge\npeople felt suspicious of him. It didn't look well. You and the doctor\nmust come down soon and tell us all about your trip. I suppose you've\nhad a splendid time.\"\n\n\"We had,\" agreed Anne. \"It was the fulfilment of years of dreams. The\nold world is very lovely and very wonderful. But we have come back very\nwell satisfied with our own land. Canada is the finest country in the\nworld, Miss Cornelia.\"\n\n\"Nobody ever doubted that,\" said Miss Cornelia, complacently.\n\n\"And old P.E.I. is the loveliest province in it and Four Winds the\nloveliest spot in P.E.I.,\" laughed Anne, looking adoringly out over the\nsunset splendour of glen and harbour and gulf. She waved her hand at it.\n\"I saw nothing more beautiful than that in Europe, Miss Cornelia. Must\nyou go? The children will be sorry to have missed you.\"\n\n\"They must come and see me soon. Tell them the doughnut jar is always\nfull.\"\n\n\"Oh, at supper they were planning a descent on you. They'll go soon; but\nthey must settle down to school again now. And the twins are going to\ntake music lessons.\"\n\n\"Not from the Methodist minister's wife, I hope?\" said Miss Cornelia\nanxiously.\n\n\"No--from Rosemary West. I was up last evening to arrange it with her.\nWhat a pretty girl she is!\"\n\n\"Rosemary holds her own well. She isn't as young as she once was.\"\n\n\"I thought her very charming. I've never had any real acquaintance with\nher, you know. Their house is so out of the way, and I've seldom ever\nseen her except at church.\"\n\n\"People always have liked Rosemary West, though they don't understand\nher,\" said Miss Cornelia, quite unconscious of the high tribute she\nwas paying to Rosemary's charm. \"Ellen has always kept her down, so to\nspeak. She has tyrannized over her, and yet she has always indulged\nher in a good many ways. Rosemary was engaged once, you know--to young\nMartin Crawford. His ship was wrecked on the Magdalens and all the crew\nwere drowned. Rosemary was just a child--only seventeen. But she was\nnever the same afterwards. She and Ellen have stayed very close at home\nsince their mother's death. They don't often get to their own church at\nLowbridge and I understand Ellen doesn't approve of going too often to a\nPresbyterian church. To the Methodist she NEVER goes, I'll say that much\nfor her. That family of Wests have always been strong Episcopalians.\nRosemary and Ellen are pretty well off. Rosemary doesn't really need to\ngive music lessons. She does it because she likes to. They are distantly\nrelated to Leslie, you know. Are the Fords coming to the harbour this\nsummer?\"\n\n\"No. They are going on a trip to Japan and will probably be away for a\nyear. Owen's new novel is to have a Japanese setting. This will be the\nfirst summer that the dear old House of Dreams will be empty since we\nleft it.\"\n\n\"I should think Owen Ford might find enough to write about in Canada\nwithout dragging his wife and his innocent children off to a heathen\ncountry like Japan,\" grumbled Miss Cornelia. \"_The Life Book_ was the\nbest book he's ever written and he got the material for that right here\nin Four Winds.\"\n\n\"Captain Jim gave him the most of that, you know. And he collected it\nall over the world. But Owen's books are all delightful, I think.\"\n\n\"Oh, they're well enough as far as they go. I make it a point to read\nevery one he writes, though I've always held, Anne dearie, that reading\nnovels is a sinful waste of time. I shall write and tell him my opinion\nof this Japanese business, believe ME. Does he want Kenneth and Persis\nto be converted into pagans?\"\n\nWith which unanswerable conundrum Miss Cornelia took her departure.\nSusan proceeded to put Rilla in bed and Anne sat on the veranda steps\nunder the early stars and dreamed her incorrigible dreams and learned\nall over again for the hundredth happy time what a moonrise splendour\nand sheen could be on Four Winds Harbour.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. THE INGLESIDE CHILDREN\n\nIn daytime the Blythe children liked very well to play in the rich, soft\ngreens and glooms of the big maple grove between Ingleside and the Glen\nSt. Mary pond; but for evening revels there was no place like the little\nvalley behind the maple grove. It was a fairy realm of romance to them.\nOnce, looking from the attic windows of Ingleside, through the mist\nand aftermath of a summer thunderstorm, they had seen the beloved spot\narched by a glorious rainbow, one end of which seemed to dip straight\ndown to where a corner of the pond ran up into the lower end of the\nvalley.\n\n\"Let us call it Rainbow Valley,\" said Walter delightedly, and Rainbow\nValley thenceforth it was.\n\nOutside of Rainbow Valley the wind might be rollicking and boisterous.\nHere it always went gently. Little, winding, fairy paths ran here and\nthere over spruce roots cushioned with moss. Wild cherry trees, that in\nblossom time would be misty white, were scattered all over the valley,\nmingling with the dark spruces. A little brook with amber waters\nran through it from the Glen village. The houses of the village were\ncomfortably far away; only at the upper end of the valley was a little\ntumble-down, deserted cottage, referred to as \"the old Bailey house.\" It\nhad not been occupied for many years, but a grass-grown dyke surrounded\nit and inside was an ancient garden where the Ingleside children could\nfind violets and daisies and June lilies still blooming in season. For\nthe rest, the garden was overgrown with caraway that swayed and foamed\nin the moonshine of summer eves like seas of silver.\n\nTo the sought lay the pond and beyond it the ripened distance lost\nitself in purple woods, save where, on a high hill, a solitary old gray\nhomestead looked down on glen and harbour. There was a certain wild\nwoodsiness and solitude about Rainbow Valley, in spite of its nearness\nto the village, which endeared it to the children of Ingleside.\n\nThe valley was full of dear, friendly hollows and the largest of these\nwas their favourite stamping ground. Here they were assembled on this\nparticular evening. There was a grove of young spruces in this hollow,\nwith a tiny, grassy glade in its heart, opening on the bank of the\nbrook. By the brook grew a silver birch-tree, a young, incredibly\nstraight thing which Walter had named the \"White Lady.\" In this glade,\ntoo, were the \"Tree Lovers,\" as Walter called a spruce and maple\nwhich grew so closely together that their boughs were inextricably\nintertwined. Jem had hung an old string of sleigh-bells, given him\nby the Glen blacksmith, on the Tree Lovers, and every visitant breeze\ncalled out sudden fairy tinkles from it.\n\n\"How nice it is to be back!\" said Nan. \"After all, none of the Avonlea\nplaces are quite as nice as Rainbow Valley.\"\n\nBut they were very fond of the Avonlea places for all that. A visit to\nGreen Gables was always considered a great treat. Aunt Marilla was very\ngood to them, and so was Mrs. Rachel Lynde, who was spending the leisure\nof her old age in knitting cotton-warp quilts against the day when\nAnne's daughters should need a \"setting-out.\" There were jolly playmates\nthere, too--\"Uncle\" Davy's children and \"Aunt\" Diana's children. They\nknew all the spots their mother had loved so well in her girlhood at old\nGreen Gables--the long Lover's Lane, that was pink-hedged in wild-rose\ntime, the always neat yard, with its willows and poplars, the Dryad's\nBubble, lucent and lovely as of yore, the Lake of Shining Waters, and\nWillowmere. The twins had their mother's old porch-gable room, and Aunt\nMarilla used to come in at night, when she thought they were asleep, to\ngloat over them. But they all knew she loved Jem the best.\n\nJem was at present busily occupied in frying a mess of small trout which\nhe had just caught in the pond. His stove consisted of a circle of red\nstones, with a fire kindled in it, and his culinary utensils were an\nold tin can, hammered out flat, and a fork with only one tine left.\nNevertheless, ripping good meals had before now been thus prepared.\n\nJem was the child of the House of Dreams. All the others had been born\nat Ingleside. He had curly red hair, like his mother's, and frank hazel\neyes, like his father's; he had his mother's fine nose and his father's\nsteady, humorous mouth. And he was the only one of the family who had\nears nice enough to please Susan. But he had a standing feud with Susan\nbecause she would not give up calling him Little Jem. It was outrageous,\nthought thirteen-year-old Jem. Mother had more sense.\n\n\"I'm NOT little any more, Mother,\" he had cried indignantly, on his\neighth birthday. \"I'm AWFUL big.\"\n\nMother had sighed and laughed and sighed again; and she never called him\nLittle Jem again--in his hearing at least.\n\nHe was and always had been a sturdy, reliable little chap. He never\nbroke a promise. He was not a great talker. His teachers did not think\nhim brilliant, but he was a good, all-round student. He never took\nthings on faith; he always liked to investigate the truth of a statement\nfor himself. Once Susan had told him that if he touched his tongue to a\nfrosty latch all the skin would tear off it. Jem had promptly done it,\n\"just to see if it was so.\" He found it was \"so,\" at the cost of a very\nsore tongue for several days. But Jem did not grudge suffering in the\ninterests of science. By constant experiment and observation he\nlearned a great deal and his brothers and sisters thought his extensive\nknowledge of their little world quite wonderful. Jem always knew where\nthe first and ripest berries grew, where the first pale violets shyly\nwakened from their winter's sleep, and how many blue eggs were in a\ngiven robin's nest in the maple grove. He could tell fortunes from daisy\npetals and suck honey from red clovers, and grub up all sorts of edible\nroots on the banks of the pond, while Susan went in daily fear that they\nwould all be poisoned. He knew where the finest spruce-gum was to be\nfound, in pale amber knots on the lichened bark, he knew where the nuts\ngrew thickest in the beechwoods around the Harbour Head, and where the\nbest trouting places up the brooks were. He could mimic the call of any\nwild bird or beast in Four Winds and he knew the haunt of every wild\nflower from spring to autumn.\n\nWalter Blythe was sitting under the White Lady, with a volume of poems\nlying beside him, but he was not reading. He was gazing now at the\nemerald-misted willows by the pond, and now at a flock of clouds, like\nlittle silver sheep, herded by the wind, that were drifting over Rainbow\nValley, with rapture in his wide splendid eyes. Walter's eyes were\nvery wonderful. All the joy and sorrow and laughter and loyalty and\naspiration of many generations lying under the sod looked out of their\ndark gray depths.\n\nWalter was a \"hop out of kin,\" as far as looks went. He did not resemble\nany known relative. He was quite the handsomest of the Ingleside\nchildren, with straight black hair and finely modelled features. But he\nhad all his mother's vivid imagination and passionate love of beauty.\nFrost of winter, invitation of spring, dream of summer and glamour of\nautumn, all meant much to Walter.\n\nIn school, where Jem was a chieftain, Walter was not thought highly of.\nHe was supposed to be \"girly\" and milk-soppish, because he never fought\nand seldom joined in the school sports, preferring to herd by himself in\nout of the way corners and read books--especially \"po'try books.\" Walter\nloved the poets and pored over their pages from the time he could first\nread. Their music was woven into his growing soul--the music of the\nimmortals. Walter cherished the ambition to be a poet himself some\nday. The thing could be done. A certain Uncle Paul--so called out of\ncourtesy--who lived now in that mysterious realm called \"the States,\"\nwas Walter's model. Uncle Paul had once been a little school boy in\nAvonlea and now his poetry was read everywhere. But the Glen schoolboys\ndid not know of Walter's dreams and would not have been greatly\nimpressed if they had. In spite of his lack of physical prowess,\nhowever, he commanded a certain unwilling respect because of his power\nof \"talking book talk.\" Nobody in Glen St. Mary school could talk like\nhim. He \"sounded like a preacher,\" one boy said; and for this reason he\nwas generally left alone and not persecuted, as most boys were who were\nsuspected of disliking or fearing fisticuffs.\n\nThe ten year old Ingleside twins violated twin tradition by not looking\nin the least alike. Anne, who was always called Nan, was very pretty,\nwith velvety nut-brown eyes and silky nut-brown hair. She was a very\nblithe and dainty little maiden--Blythe by name and blithe by nature,\none of her teachers had said. Her complexion was quite faultless, much\nto her mother's satisfaction.\n\n\"I'm so glad I have one daughter who can wear pink,\" Mrs. Blythe was\nwont to say jubilantly.\n\nDiana Blythe, known as Di, was very like her mother, with gray-green\neyes that always shone with a peculiar lustre and brilliancy in the\ndusk, and red hair. Perhaps this was why she was her father's favourite.\nShe and Walter were especial chums; Di was the only one to whom he would\never read the verses he wrote himself--the only one who knew that he\nwas secretly hard at work on an epic, strikingly resembling \"Marmion\" in\nsome things, if not in others. She kept all his secrets, even from Nan,\nand told him all hers.\n\n\"Won't you soon have those fish ready, Jem?\" said Nan, sniffing with her\ndainty nose. \"The smell makes me awfully hungry.\"\n\n\"They're nearly ready,\" said Jem, giving one a dexterous turn. \"Get out\nthe bread and the plates, girls. Walter, wake up.\"\n\n\"How the air shines to-night,\" said Walter dreamily. Not that he\ndespised fried trout either, by any means; but with Walter food for the\nsoul always took first place. \"The flower angel has been walking over\nthe world to-day, calling to the flowers. I can see his blue wings on\nthat hill by the woods.\"\n\n\"Any angels' wings I ever saw were white,\" said Nan.\n\n\"The flower angel's aren't. They are a pale misty blue, just like the\nhaze in the valley. Oh, how I wish I could fly. It must be glorious.\"\n\n\"One does fly in dreams sometimes,\" said Di.\n\n\"I never dream that I'm flying exactly,\" said Walter. \"But I often dream\nthat I just rise up from the ground and float over the fences and the\ntrees. It's delightful--and I always think, 'This ISN'T a dream like\nit's always been before. THIS is real'--and then I wake up after all,\nand it's heart-breaking.\"\n\n\"Hurry up, Nan,\" ordered Jem.\n\nNan had produced the banquet-board--a board literally as well as\nfiguratively--from which many a feast, seasoned as no viands were\nelsewhere, had been eaten in Rainbow Valley. It was converted into a\ntable by propping it on two large, mossy stones. Newspapers served as\ntablecloth, and broken plates and handleless cups from Susan's discard\nfurnished the dishes. From a tin box secreted at the root of a spruce\ntree Nan brought forth bread and salt. The brook gave Adam's ale of\nunsurpassed crystal. For the rest, there was a certain sauce, compounded\nof fresh air and appetite of youth, which gave to everything a divine\nflavour. To sit in Rainbow Valley, steeped in a twilight half gold, half\namethyst, rife with the odours of balsam-fir and woodsy growing things\nin their springtime prime, with the pale stars of wild strawberry\nblossoms all around you, and with the sough of the wind and tinkle of\nbells in the shaking tree tops, and eat fried trout and dry bread, was\nsomething which the mighty of earth might have envied them.\n\n\"Sit in,\" invited Nan, as Jem placed his sizzling tin platter of trout\non the table. \"It's your turn to say grace, Jem.\"\n\n\"I've done my part frying the trout,\" protested Jem, who hated saying\ngrace. \"Let Walter say it. He LIKES saying grace. And cut it short, too,\nWalt. I'm starving.\"\n\nBut Walter said no grace, short or long, just then. An interruption\noccurred.\n\n\"Who's coming down from the manse hill?\" said Di.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. THE MANSE CHILDREN\n\nAunt Martha might be, and was, a very poor housekeeper; the Rev. John\nKnox Meredith might be, and was, a very absent-minded, indulgent man.\nBut it could not be denied that there was something very homelike and\nlovable about the Glen St. Mary manse in spite of its untidiness. Even\nthe critical housewives of the Glen felt it, and were unconsciously\nmellowed in judgment because of it. Perhaps its charm was in part due to\naccidental circumstances--the luxuriant vines clustering over its\ngray, clap-boarded walls, the friendly acacias and balm-of-gileads that\ncrowded about it with the freedom of old acquaintance, and the beautiful\nviews of harbour and sand-dunes from its front windows. But these things\nhad been there in the reign of Mr. Meredith's predecessor, when the\nmanse had been the primmest, neatest, and dreariest house in the Glen.\nSo much of the credit must be given to the personality of its new\ninmates. There was an atmosphere of laughter and comradeship about it;\nthe doors were always open; and inner and outer worlds joined hands.\nLove was the only law in Glen St. Mary manse.\n\nThe people of his congregation said that Mr. Meredith spoiled his\nchildren. Very likely he did. It is certain that he could not bear to\nscold them. \"They have no mother,\" he used to say to himself, with a\nsigh, when some unusually glaring peccadillo forced itself upon his\nnotice. But he did not know the half of their goings-on. He belonged\nto the sect of dreamers. The windows of his study looked out on the\ngraveyard but, as he paced up and down the room, reflecting deeply on\nthe immortality of the soul, he was quite unaware that Jerry and Carl\nwere playing leap-frog hilariously over the flat stones in that abode of\ndead Methodists. Mr. Meredith had occasional acute realizations that his\nchildren were not so well looked after, physically or morally, as they\nhad been before his wife died, and he had always a dim sub-consciousness\nthat house and meals were very different under Aunt Martha's management\nfrom what they had been under Cecilia's. For the rest, he lived in a\nworld of books and abstractions; and, therefore, although his clothes\nwere seldom brushed, and although the Glen housewives concluded, from\nthe ivory-like pallor of his clear-cut features and slender hands, that\nhe never got enough to eat, he was not an unhappy man.\n\nIf ever a graveyard could be called a cheerful place, the old Methodist\ngraveyard at Glen St. Mary might be so called. The new graveyard, at the\nother side of the Methodist church, was a neat and proper and doleful\nspot; but the old one had been left so long to Nature's kindly and\ngracious ministries that it had become very pleasant.\n\nIt was surrounded on three sides by a dyke of stones and sod, topped\nby a gray and uncertain paling. Outside the dyke grew a row of tall fir\ntrees with thick, balsamic boughs. The dyke, which had been built by the\nfirst settlers of the Glen, was old enough to be beautiful, with mosses\nand green things growing out of its crevices, violets purpling at its\nbase in the early spring days, and asters and golden-rod making an\nautumnal glory in its corners. Little ferns clustered companionably\nbetween its stones, and here and there a big bracken grew.\n\nOn the eastern side there was neither fence nor dyke. The graveyard\nthere straggled off into a young fir plantation, ever pushing nearer to\nthe graves and deepening eastward into a thick wood. The air was always\nfull of the harp-like voices of the sea, and the music of gray old\ntrees, and in the spring mornings the choruses of birds in the elms\naround the two churches sang of life and not of death. The Meredith\nchildren loved the old graveyard.\n\nBlue-eyed ivy, \"garden-spruce,\" and mint ran riot over the sunken\ngraves. Blueberry bushes grew lavishly in the sandy corner next to the\nfir wood. The varying fashions of tombstones for three generations were\nto be found there, from the flat, oblong, red sandstone slabs of old\nsettlers, down through the days of weeping willows and clasped hands, to\nthe latest monstrosities of tall \"monuments\" and draped urns. One of\nthe latter, the biggest and ugliest in the graveyard, was sacred to the\nmemory of a certain Alec Davis who had been born a Methodist but had\ntaken to himself a Presbyterian bride of the Douglas clan. She had made\nhim turn Presbyterian and kept him toeing the Presbyterian mark all his\nlife. But when he died she did not dare to doom him to a lonely grave in\nthe Presbyterian graveyard over-harbour. His people were all buried in\nthe Methodist cemetery; so Alec Davis went back to his own in death and\nhis widow consoled herself by erecting a monument which cost more than\nany of the Methodists could afford. The Meredith children hated it,\nwithout just knowing why, but they loved the old, flat, bench-like\nstones with the tall grasses growing rankly about them. They made jolly\nseats for one thing. They were all sitting on one now. Jerry, tired of\nleap frog, was playing on a jew's-harp. Carl was lovingly poring over a\nstrange beetle he had found; Una was trying to make a doll's dress, and\nFaith, leaning back on her slender brown wrists, was swinging her bare\nfeet in lively time to the jew's-harp.\n\nJerry had his father's black hair and large black eyes, but in him the\nlatter were flashing instead of dreamy. Faith, who came next to him,\nwore her beauty like a rose, careless and glowing. She had golden-brown\neyes, golden-brown curls and crimson cheeks. She laughed too much to\nplease her father's congregation and had shocked old Mrs. Taylor,\nthe disconsolate spouse of several departed husbands, by saucily\ndeclaring--in the church-porch at that--\"The world ISN'T a vale of\ntears, Mrs. Taylor. It's a world of laughter.\"\n\nLittle dreamy Una was not given to laughter. Her braids of straight,\ndead-black hair betrayed no lawless kinks, and her almond-shaped,\ndark-blue eyes had something wistful and sorrowful in them. Her mouth\nhad a trick of falling open over her tiny white teeth, and a shy,\nmeditative smile occasionally crept over her small face. She was\nmuch more sensitive to public opinion than Faith, and had an uneasy\nconsciousness that there was something askew in their way of living. She\nlonged to put it right, but did not know how. Now and then she dusted\nthe furniture--but it was so seldom she could find the duster because it\nwas never in the same place twice. And when the clothes-brush was to be\nfound she tried to brush her father's best suit on Saturdays, and once\nsewed on a missing button with coarse white thread. When Mr. Meredith\nwent to church next day every female eye saw that button and the peace\nof the Ladies' Aid was upset for weeks.\n\nCarl had the clear, bright, dark-blue eyes, fearless and direct, of his\ndead mother, and her brown hair with its glints of gold. He knew the\nsecrets of bugs and had a sort of freemasonry with bees and beetles. Una\nnever liked to sit near him because she never knew what uncanny creature\nmight be secreted about him. Jerry refused to sleep with him because\nCarl had once taken a young garter snake to bed with him; so Carl slept\nin his old cot, which was so short that he could never stretch out, and\nhad strange bed-fellows. Perhaps it was just as well that Aunt Martha\nwas half blind when she made that bed. Altogether they were a jolly,\nlovable little crew, and Cecilia Meredith's heart must have ached\nbitterly when she faced the knowledge that she must leave them.\n\n\"Where would you like to be buried if you were a Methodist?\" asked Faith\ncheerfully.\n\nThis opened up an interesting field of speculation.\n\n\"There isn't much choice. The place is full,\" said Jerry. \"I'D like that\ncorner near the road, I guess. I could hear the teams going past and the\npeople talking.\"\n\n\"I'd like that little hollow under the weeping birch,\" said Una. \"That\nbirch is such a place for birds and they sing like mad in the mornings.\"\n\n\"I'd take the Porter lot where there's so many children buried. _I_ like\nlots of company,\" said Faith. \"Carl, where'd you?\"\n\n\"I'd rather not be buried at all,\" said Carl, \"but if I had to be I'd\nlike the ant-bed. Ants are AWF'LY int'resting.\"\n\n\"How very good all the people who are buried here must have been,\" said\nUna, who had been reading the laudatory old epitaphs. \"There doesn't\nseem to be a single bad person in the whole graveyard. Methodists must\nbe better than Presbyterians after all.\"\n\n\"Maybe the Methodists bury their bad people just like they do cats,\"\nsuggested Carl. \"Maybe they don't bother bringing them to the graveyard\nat all.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Faith. \"The people that are buried here weren't any\nbetter than other folks, Una. But when anyone is dead you mustn't say\nanything of him but good or he'll come back and ha'nt you. Aunt Martha\ntold me that. I asked father if it was true and he just looked through\nme and muttered, 'True? True? What is truth? What IS truth, O jesting\nPilate?' I concluded from that it must be true.\"\n\n\"I wonder if Mr. Alec Davis would come back and ha'nt me if I threw a\nstone at the urn on top of his tombstone,\" said Jerry.\n\n\"Mrs. Davis would,\" giggled Faith. \"She just watches us in church like\na cat watching mice. Last Sunday I made a face at her nephew and he made\none back at me and you should have seen her glare. I'll bet she boxed\nHIS ears when they got out. Mrs. Marshall Elliott told me we mustn't\noffend her on any account or I'd have made a face at her, too!\"\n\n\"They say Jem Blythe stuck out his tongue at her once and she would\nnever have his father again, even when her husband was dying,\" said\nJerry. \"I wonder what the Blythe gang will be like.\"\n\n\"I liked their looks,\" said Faith. The manse children had been at the\nstation that afternoon when the Blythe small fry had arrived. \"I liked\nJem's looks ESPECIALLY.\"\n\n\"They say in school that Walter's a sissy,\" said Jerry.\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" said Una, who had thought Walter very handsome.\n\n\"Well, he writes poetry, anyhow. He won the prize the teacher offered\nlast year for writing a poem, Bertie Shakespeare Drew told me. Bertie's\nmother thought HE should have got the prize because of his name, but\nBertie said he couldn't write poetry to save his soul, name or no name.\"\n\n\"I suppose we'll get acquainted with them as soon as they begin going to\nschool,\" mused Faith. \"I hope the girls are nice. I don't like most of\nthe girls round here. Even the nice ones are poky. But the Blythe twins\nlook jolly. I thought twins always looked alike, but they don't. I think\nthe red-haired one is the nicest.\"\n\n\"I liked their mother's looks,\" said Una with a little sigh. Una envied\nall children their mothers. She had been only six when her mother died,\nbut she had some very precious memories, treasured in her soul like\njewels, of twilight cuddlings and morning frolics, of loving eyes, a\ntender voice, and the sweetest, gayest laugh.\n\n\"They say she isn't like other people,\" said Jerry.\n\n\"Mrs. Elliot says that is because she never really grew up,\" said Faith.\n\n\"She's taller than Mrs. Elliott.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, but it is inside--Mrs. Elliot says Mrs. Blythe just stayed a\nlittle girl inside.\"\n\n\"What do I smell?\" interrupted Carl, sniffing.\n\nThey all smelled it now. A most delectable odour came floating up on the\nstill evening air from the direction of the little woodsy dell below the\nmanse hill.\n\n\"That makes me hungry,\" said Jerry.\n\n\"We had only bread and molasses for supper and cold ditto for dinner,\"\nsaid Una plaintively.\n\nAunt Martha's habit was to boil a large slab of mutton early in the week\nand serve it up every day, cold and greasy, as long as it lasted. To\nthis Faith, in a moment of inspiration, had give the name of \"ditto\",\nand by this it was invariably known at the manse.\n\n\"Let's go and see where that smell is coming from,\" said Jerry.\n\nThey all sprang up, frolicked over the lawn with the abandon of young\npuppies, climbed a fence, and tore down the mossy slope, guided by the\nsavory lure that ever grew stronger. A few minutes later they arrived\nbreathlessly in the sanctum sanctorum of Rainbow Valley where the Blythe\nchildren were just about to give thanks and eat.\n\nThey halted shyly. Una wished they had not been so precipitate: but Di\nBlythe was equal to that and any occasion. She stepped forward, with a\ncomrade's smile.\n\n\"I guess I know who you are,\" she said. \"You belong to the manse, don't\nyou?\"\n\nFaith nodded, her face creased by dimples.\n\n\"We smelled your trout cooking and wondered what it was.\"\n\n\"You must sit down and help us eat them,\" said Di.\n\n\"Maybe you haven't more than you want yourselves,\" said Jerry, looking\nhungrily at the tin platter.\n\n\"We've heaps--three apiece,\" said Jem. \"Sit down.\"\n\nNo more ceremony was necessary. Down they all sat on mossy stones. Merry\nwas that feast and long. Nan and Di would probably have died of horror\nhad they known what Faith and Una knew perfectly well--that Carl had\ntwo young mice in his jacket pocket. But they never knew it, so it never\nhurt them. Where can folks get better acquainted than over a meal table?\nWhen the last trout had vanished, the manse children and the Ingleside\nchildren were sworn friends and allies. They had always known each other\nand always would. The race of Joseph recognized its own.\n\nThey poured out the history of their little pasts. The manse children\nheard of Avonlea and Green Gables, of Rainbow Valley traditions, and\nof the little house by the harbour shore where Jem had been born. The\nIngleside children heard of Maywater, where the Merediths had lived\nbefore coming to the Glen, of Una's beloved, one-eyed doll and Faith's\npet rooster.\n\nFaith was inclined to resent the fact that people laughed at her for\npetting a rooster. She liked the Blythes because they accepted it\nwithout question.\n\n\"A handsome rooster like Adam is just as nice a pet as a dog or cat, _I_\nthink,\" she said. \"If he was a canary nobody would wonder. And I brought\nhim up from a little, wee, yellow chicken. Mrs. Johnson at Maywater gave\nhim to me. A weasel had killed all his brothers and sisters. I called\nhim after her husband. I never liked dolls or cats. Cats are too sneaky\nand dolls are DEAD.\"\n\n\"Who lives in that house away up there?\" asked Jerry.\n\n\"The Miss Wests--Rosemary and Ellen,\" answered Nan. \"Di and I are going\nto take music lessons from Miss Rosemary this summer.\"\n\nUna gazed at the lucky twins with eyes whose longing was too gentle for\nenvy. Oh, if she could only have music lessons! It was one of the dreams\nof her little hidden life. But nobody ever thought of such a thing.\n\n\"Miss Rosemary is so sweet and she always dresses so pretty,\" said\nDi. \"Her hair is just the colour of new molasses taffy,\" she added\nwistfully--for Di, like her mother before her, was not resigned to her\nown ruddy tresses.\n\n\"I like Miss Ellen, too,\" said Nan. \"She always used to give me candies\nwhen she came to church. But Di is afraid of her.\"\n\n\"Her brows are so black and she has such a great deep voice,\" said\nDi. \"Oh, how scared of her Kenneth Ford used to be when he was little!\nMother says the first Sunday Mrs. Ford brought him to church Miss Ellen\nhappened to be there, sitting right behind them. And the minute Kenneth\nsaw her he just screamed and screamed until Mrs. Ford had to carry him\nout.\"\n\n\"Who is Mrs. Ford?\" asked Una wonderingly.\n\n\"Oh, the Fords don't live here. They only come here in the summer. And\nthey're not coming this summer. They live in that little house 'way,\n'way down on the harbour shore where father and mother used to lie. I\nwish you could see Persis Ford. She is just like a picture.\"\n\n\"I've heard of Mrs. Ford,\" broke in Faith. \"Bertie Shakespeare Drew told\nme about her. She was married fourteen years to a dead man and then he\ncame to life.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Nan. \"That isn't the way it goes at all. Bertie\nShakespeare can never get anything straight. I know the whole story and\nI'll tell it to you some time, but not now, for it's too long and it's\ntime for us to go home. Mother doesn't like us to be out late these damp\nevenings.\"\n\nNobody cared whether the manse children were out in the damp or not.\nAunt Martha was already in bed and the minister was still too deeply\nlost in speculations concerning the immortality of the soul to remember\nthe mortality of the body. But they went home, too, with visions of good\ntimes coming in their heads.\n\n\"I think Rainbow Valley is even nicer than the graveyard,\" said Una.\n\"And I just love those dear Blythes. It's SO nice when you can love\npeople because so often you CAN'T. Father said in his sermon last Sunday\nthat we should love everybody. But how can we? How could we love Mrs.\nAlec Davis?\"\n\n\"Oh, father only said that in the pulpit,\" said Faith airily. \"He has\nmore sense than to really think it outside.\"\n\nThe Blythe children went up to Ingleside, except Jem, who slipped away\nfor a few moments on a solitary expedition to a remote corner of Rainbow\nValley. Mayflowers grew there and Jem never forgot to take his mother a\nbouquet as long as they lasted.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. THE ADVENT OF MARY VANCE\n\n\"This is just the sort of day you feel as if things might happen,\" said\nFaith, responsive to the lure of crystal air and blue hills. She hugged\nherself with delight and danced a hornpipe on old Hezekiah Pollock's\nbench tombstone, much to the horror of two ancient maidens who happened\nto be driving past just as Faith hopped on one foot around the stone,\nwaving the other and her arms in the air.\n\n\"And that,\" groaned one ancient maiden, \"is our minister's daughter.\"\n\n\"What else could you expect of a widower's family?\" groaned the other\nancient maiden. And then they both shook their heads.\n\nIt was early on Saturday morning and the Merediths were out in the\ndew-drenched world with a delightful consciousness of the holiday. They\nhad never had anything to do on a holiday. Even Nan and Di Blythe had\ncertain household tasks for Saturday mornings, but the daughters of the\nmanse were free to roam from blushing morn to dewy eve if so it pleased\nthem. It DID please Faith, but Una felt a secret, bitter humiliation\nbecause they never learned to do anything. The other girls in her class\nat school could cook and sew and knit; she only was a little ignoramus.\n\nJerry suggested that they go exploring; so they went lingeringly through\nthe fir grove, picking up Carl on the way, who was on his knees in the\ndripping grass studying his darling ants. Beyond the grove they came out\nin Mr. Taylor's pasture field, sprinkled over with the white ghosts of\ndandelions; in a remote corner was an old tumbledown barn, where Mr.\nTaylor sometimes stored his surplus hay crop but which was never used\nfor any other purpose. Thither the Meredith children trooped, and\nprowled about the ground floor for several minutes.\n\n\"What was that?\" whispered Una suddenly.\n\nThey all listened. There was a faint but distinct rustle in the hayloft\nabove. The Merediths looked at each other.\n\n\"There's something up there,\" breathed Faith.\n\n\"I'm going up to see what it is,\" said Jerry resolutely.\n\n\"Oh, don't,\" begged Una, catching his arm.\n\n\"I'm going.\"\n\n\"We'll all go, too, then,\" said Faith.\n\nThe whole four climbed the shaky ladder, Jerry and Faith quite\ndauntless, Una pale from fright, and Carl rather absent-mindedly\nspeculating on the possibility of finding a bat up in the loft. He\nlonged to see a bat in daylight.\n\nWhen they stepped off the ladder they saw what had made the rustle and\nthe sight struck them dumb for a few moments.\n\nIn a little nest in the hay a girl was curled up, looking as if she had\njust wakened from sleep. When she saw them she stood up, rather shakily,\nas it seemed, and in the bright sunlight that streamed through the\ncobwebbed window behind her, they saw that her thin, sunburned face was\nvery pale under its tan. She had two braids of lank, thick, tow-coloured\nhair and very odd eyes--\"white eyes,\" the manse children thought, as she\nstared at them half defiantly, half piteously. They were really of so\npale a blue that they did seem almost white, especially when contrasted\nwith the narrow black ring that circled the iris. She was barefooted and\nbareheaded, and was clad in a faded, ragged, old plaid dress, much too\nshort and tight for her. As for years, she might have been almost any\nage, judging from her wizened little face, but her height seemed to be\nsomewhere in the neighbourhood of twelve.\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked Jerry.\n\nThe girl looked about her as if seeking a way of escape. Then she seemed\nto give in with a little shiver of despair.\n\n\"I'm Mary Vance,\" she said.\n\n\"Where'd you come from?\" pursued Jerry.\n\nMary, instead of replying, suddenly sat, or fell, down on the hay and\nbegan to cry. Instantly Faith had flung herself down beside her and put\nher arm around the thin, shaking shoulders.\n\n\"You stop bothering her,\" she commanded Jerry. Then she hugged the waif.\n\"Don't cry, dear. Just tell us what's the matter. WE'RE friends.\"\n\n\"I'm so--so--hungry,\" wailed Mary. \"I--I hain't had a thing to eat since\nThursday morning, 'cept a little water from the brook out there.\"\n\nThe manse children gazed at each other in horror. Faith sprang up.\n\n\"You come right up to the manse and get something to eat before you say\nanother word.\"\n\nMary shrank.\n\n\"Oh--I can't. What will your pa and ma say? Besides, they'd send me\nback.\"\n\n\"We've no mother, and father won't bother about you. Neither will Aunt\nMartha. Come, I say.\" Faith stamped her foot impatiently. Was this queer\ngirl going to insist on starving to death almost at their very door?\n\nMary yielded. She was so weak that she could hardly climb down the\nladder, but somehow they got her down and over the field and into the\nmanse kitchen. Aunt Martha, muddling through her Saturday cooking, took\nno notice of her. Faith and Una flew to the pantry and ransacked it for\nsuch eatables as it contained--some \"ditto,\" bread, butter, milk and a\ndoubtful pie. Mary Vance attacked the food ravenously and uncritically,\nwhile the manse children stood around and watched her. Jerry noticed\nthat she had a pretty mouth and very nice, even, white teeth. Faith\ndecided, with secret horror, that Mary had not one stitch on her except\nthat ragged, faded dress. Una was full of pure pity, Carl of amused\nwonder, and all of them of curiosity.\n\n\"Now come out to the graveyard and tell us about yourself,\" ordered\nFaith, when Mary's appetite showed signs of failing her. Mary was now\nnothing loath. Food had restored her natural vivacity and unloosed her\nby no means reluctant tongue.\n\n\"You won't tell your pa or anybody if I tell you?\" she stipulated, when\nshe was enthroned on Mr. Pollock's tombstone. Opposite her the manse\nchildren lined up on another. Here was spice and mystery and adventure.\nSomething HAD happened.\n\n\"No, we won't.\"\n\n\"Cross your hearts?\"\n\n\"Cross our hearts.\"\n\n\"Well, I've run away. I was living with Mrs. Wiley over-harbour. Do you\nknow Mrs. Wiley?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, you don't want to know her. She's an awful woman. My, how I hate\nher! She worked me to death and wouldn't give me half enough to eat, and\nshe used to larrup me 'most every day. Look a-here.\"\n\nMary rolled up her ragged sleeves, and held up her scrawny arms and\nthin hands, chapped almost to rawness. They were black with bruises. The\nmanse children shivered. Faith flushed crimson with indignation. Una's\nblue eyes filled with tears.\n\n\"She licked me Wednesday night with a stick,\" said Mary, indifferently.\n\"It was 'cause I let the cow kick over a pail of milk. How'd I know the\ndarn old cow was going to kick?\"\n\nA not unpleasant thrill ran over her listeners. They would never dream\nof using such dubious words, but it was rather titivating to hear\nsomeone else use them--and a girl, at that. Certainly this Mary Vance\nwas an interesting creature.\n\n\"I don't blame you for running away,\" said Faith.\n\n\"Oh, I didn't run away 'cause she licked me. A licking was all in the\nday's work with me. I was darn well used to it. Nope, I'd meant to run\naway for a week 'cause I'd found out that Mrs. Wiley was going to rent\nher farm and go to Lowbridge to live and give me to a cousin of hers\nup Charlottetown way. I wasn't going to stand for THAT. She was a worse\nsort than Mrs. Wiley even. Mrs. Wiley lent me to her for a month last\nsummer and I'd rather live with the devil himself.\"\n\nSensation number two. But Una looked doubtful.\n\n\"So I made up my mind I'd beat it. I had seventy cents saved up that\nMrs. John Crawford give me in the spring for planting potatoes for her.\nMrs. Wiley didn't know about it. She was away visiting her cousin when\nI planted them. I thought I'd sneak up here to the Glen and buy a ticket\nto Charlottetown and try to get work there. I'm a hustler, let me tell\nyou. There ain't a lazy bone in MY body. So I lit out Thursday morning\n'fore Mrs. Wiley was up and walked to the Glen--six miles. And when I\ngot to the station I found I'd lost my money. Dunno how--dunno where.\nAnyhow, it was gone. I didn't know what to do. If I went back to old\nLady Wiley she'd take the hide off me. So I went and hid in that old\nbarn.\"\n\n\"And what will you do now?\" asked Jerry.\n\n\"Dunno. I s'pose I'll have to go back and take my medicine. Now that\nI've got some grub in my stomach I guess I can stand it.\"\n\nBut there was fear behind the bravado in Mary's eyes. Una suddenly\nslipped from the one tombstone to the other and put her arm about Mary.\n\n\"Don't go back. Just stay here with us.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Wiley'll hunt me up,\" said Mary. \"It's likely she's on my\ntrail before this. I might stay here till she finds me, I s'pose, if\nyour folks don't mind. I was a darn fool ever to think of skipping out.\nShe'd run a weasel to earth. But I was so misrebul.\"\n\nMary's voice quivered, but she was ashamed of showing her weakness.\n\n\"I hain't had the life of a dog for these four years,\" she explained\ndefiantly.\n\n\"You've been four years with Mrs. Wiley?\"\n\n\"Yip. She took me out of the asylum over in Hopetown when I was eight.\"\n\n\"That's the same place Mrs. Blythe came from,\" exclaimed Faith.\n\n\"I was two years in the asylum. I was put there when I was six. My ma\nhad hung herself and my pa had cut his throat.\"\n\n\"Holy cats! Why?\" said Jerry.\n\n\"Booze,\" said Mary laconically.\n\n\"And you've no relations?\"\n\n\"Not a darn one that I know of. Must have had some once, though. I was\ncalled after half a dozen of them. My full name is Mary Martha Lucilla\nMoore Ball Vance. Can you beat that? My grandfather was a rich man. I'll\nbet he was richer than YOUR grandfather. But pa drunk it all up and ma,\nshe did her part. THEY used to beat me, too. Laws, I've been licked so\nmuch I kind of like it.\"\n\nMary tossed her head. She divined that the manse children were pitying\nher for her many stripes and she did not want pity. She wanted to be\nenvied. She looked gaily about her. Her strange eyes, now that the\ndullness of famine was removed from them, were brilliant. She would show\nthese youngsters what a personage she was.\n\n\"I've been sick an awful lot,\" she said proudly. \"There's not many kids\ncould have come through what I have. I've had scarlet fever and measles\nand ersipelas and mumps and whooping cough and pewmonia.\"\n\n\"Were you ever fatally sick?\" asked Una.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Mary doubtfully.\n\n\"Of course she wasn't,\" scoffed Jerry. \"If you're fatally sick you die.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, I never died exactly,\" said Mary, \"but I come blamed near it\nonce. They thought I was dead and they were getting ready to lay me out\nwhen I up and come to.\"\n\n\"What is it like to be half dead?\" asked Jerry curiously.\n\n\"Like nothing. I didn't know it for days afterwards. It was when I had\nthe pewmonia. Mrs. Wiley wouldn't have the doctor--said she wasn't\ngoing to no such expense for a home girl. Old Aunt Christina MacAllister\nnursed me with poultices. She brung me round. But sometimes I wish I'd\njust died the other half and done with it. I'd been better off.\"\n\n\"If you went to heaven I s'pose you would,\" said Faith, rather\ndoubtfully.\n\n\"Well, what other place is there to go to?\" demanded Mary in a puzzled\nvoice.\n\n\"There's hell, you know,\" said Una, dropping her voice and hugging Mary\nto lessen the awfulness of the suggestion.\n\n\"Hell? What's that?\"\n\n\"Why, it's where the devil lives,\" said Jerry. \"You've heard of him--you\nspoke about him.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, but I didn't know he lived anywhere. I thought he just roamed\nround. Mr. Wiley used to mention hell when he was alive. He was always\ntelling folks to go there. I thought it was some place over in New\nBrunswick where he come from.\"\n\n\"Hell is an awful place,\" said Faith, with the dramatic enjoyment that\nis born of telling dreadful things. \"Bad people go there when they die\nand burn in fire for ever and ever and ever.\"\n\n\"Who told you that?\" demanded Mary incredulously.\n\n\"It's in the Bible. And Mr. Isaac Crothers at Maywater told us, too, in\nSunday School. He was an elder and a pillar in the church and knew all\nabout it. But you needn't worry. If you're good you'll go to heaven and\nif you're bad I guess you'd rather go to hell.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't,\" said Mary positively. \"No matter how bad I was I wouldn't\nwant to be burned and burned. _I_ know what it's like. I picked up a red\nhot poker once by accident. What must you do to be good?\"\n\n\"You must go to church and Sunday School and read your Bible and pray\nevery night and give to missions,\" said Una.\n\n\"It sounds like a large order,\" said Mary. \"Anything else?\"\n\n\"You must ask God to forgive the sins you've committed.\n\n\"But I've never com--committed any,\" said Mary. \"What's a sin any way?\"\n\n\"Oh, Mary, you must have. Everybody does. Did you never tell a lie?\"\n\n\"Heaps of 'em,\" said Mary.\n\n\"That's a dreadful sin,\" said Una solemnly.\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me,\" demanded Mary, \"that I'd be sent to hell for\ntelling a lie now and then? Why, I HAD to. Mr. Wiley would have broken\nevery bone in my body one time if I hadn't told him a lie. Lies have\nsaved me many a whack, I can tell you.\"\n\nUna sighed. Here were too many difficulties for her to solve. She\nshuddered as she thought of being cruelly whipped. Very likely she would\nhave lied too. She squeezed Mary's little calloused hand.\n\n\"Is that the only dress you've got?\" asked Faith, whose joyous nature\nrefused to dwell on disagreeable subjects.\n\n\"I just put on this dress because it was no good,\" cried Mary flushing.\n\"Mrs. Wiley'd bought my clothes and I wasn't going to be beholden to her\nfor anything. And I'm honest. If I was going to run away I wasn't going\nto take what belong to HER that was worth anything. When I grow up\nI'm going to have a blue sating dress. Your own clothes don't look so\nstylish. I thought ministers' children were always dressed up.\"\n\nIt was plain that Mary had a temper and was sensitive on some points.\nBut there was a queer, wild charm about her which captivated them all.\nShe was taken to Rainbow Valley that afternoon and introduced to the\nBlythes as \"a friend of ours from over-harbour who is visiting us.\" The\nBlythes accepted her unquestioningly, perhaps because she was fairly\nrespectable now. After dinner--through which Aunt Martha had mumbled and\nMr. Meredith had been in a state of semi-unconsciousness while brooding\nhis Sunday sermon--Faith had prevailed on Mary to put on one of her\ndresses, as well as certain other articles of clothing. With her hair\nneatly braided Mary passed muster tolerably well. She was an acceptable\nplaymate, for she knew several new and exciting games, and her\nconversation lacked not spice. In fact, some of her expressions made Nan\nand Di look at her rather askance. They were not quite sure what their\nmother would have thought of her, but they knew quite well what Susan\nwould. However, she was a visitor at the manse, so she must be all\nright.\n\nWhen bedtime came there was the problem of where Mary should sleep.\n\n\"We can't put her in the spare room, you know,\" said Faith perplexedly\nto Una.\n\n\"I haven't got anything in my head,\" cried Mary in an injured tone.\n\n\"Oh, I didn't mean THAT,\" protested Faith. \"The spare room is all torn\nup. The mice have gnawed a big hole in the feather tick and made a nest\nin it. We never found it out till Aunt Martha put the Rev. Mr. Fisher\nfrom Charlottetown there to sleep last week. HE soon found it out.\nThen father had to give him his bed and sleep on the study lounge. Aunt\nMartha hasn't had time to fix the spare room bed up yet, so she says;\nso NOBODY can sleep there, no matter how clean their heads are. And our\nroom is so small, and the bed so small you can't sleep with us.\"\n\n\"I can go back to the hay in the old barn for the night if you'll lend\nme a quilt,\" said Mary philosophically. \"It was kind of chilly last\nnight, but 'cept for that I've had worse beds.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no, you mustn't do that,\" said Una. \"I've thought of a plan,\nFaith. You know that little trestle bed in the garret room, with the\nold mattress on it, that the last minister left there? Let's take up the\nspare room bedclothes and make Mary a bed there. You won't mind sleeping\nin the garret, will you, Mary? It's just above our room.\"\n\n\"Any place'll do me. Laws, I never had a decent place to sleep in my\nlife. I slept in the loft over the kitchen at Mrs. Wiley's. The roof\nleaked rain in the summer and the snow druv in in winter. My bed was a\nstraw tick on the floor. You won't find me a mite huffy about where _I_\nsleep.\"\n\nThe manse garret was a long, low, shadowy place, with one gable\nend partitioned off. Here a bed was made up for Mary of the dainty\nhemstitched sheets and embroidered spread which Cecilia Meredith had\nonce so proudly made for her spare-room, and which still survived Aunt\nMartha's uncertain washings. The good nights were said and silence fell\nover the manse. Una was just falling asleep when she heard a sound in\nthe room just above that made her sit up suddenly.\n\n\"Listen, Faith--Mary's crying,\" she whispered. Faith replied not, being\nalready asleep. Una slipped out of bed, and made her way in her little\nwhite gown down the hall and up the garret stairs. The creaking floor\ngave ample notice of her coming, and when she reached the corner room\nall was moonlit silence and the trestle bed showed only a hump in the\nmiddle.\n\n\"Mary,\" whispered Una.\n\nThere was no response.\n\nUna crept close to the bed and pulled at the spread. \"Mary, I know you\nare crying. I heard you. Are you lonesome?\"\n\nMary suddenly appeared to view but said nothing.\n\n\"Let me in beside you. I'm cold,\" said Una shivering in the chilly air,\nfor the little garret window was open and the keen breath of the north\nshore at night blew in.\n\nMary moved over and Una snuggled down beside her.\n\n\"NOW you won't be lonesome. We shouldn't have left you here alone the\nfirst night.\"\n\n\"I wasn't lonesome,\" sniffed Mary.\n\n\"What were you crying for then?\"\n\n\"Oh, I just got to thinking of things when I was here alone. I thought\nof having to go back to Mrs. Wiley--and of being licked for running\naway--and--and--and of going to hell for telling lies. It all worried me\nsomething scandalous.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mary,\" said poor Una in distress. \"I don't believe God will send\nyou to hell for telling lies when you didn't know it was wrong. He\nCOULDN'T. Why, He's kind and good. Of course, you mustn't tell any more\nnow that you know it's wrong.\"\n\n\"If I can't tell lies what's to become of me?\" said Mary with a sob.\n\"YOU don't understand. You don't know anything about it. You've got a\nhome and a kind father--though it does seem to me that he isn't more'n\nabout half there. But anyway he doesn't lick you, and you get enough to\neat such as it is--though that old aunt of yours doesn't know ANYTHING\nabout cooking. Why, this is the first day I ever remember of feeling\n'sif I'd enough to eat. I've been knocked about all of my life, 'cept\nfor the two years I was at the asylum. They didn't lick me there and it\nwasn't too bad, though the matron was cross. She always looked ready to\nbite my head off a nail. But Mrs. Wiley is a holy terror, that's what\nSHE is, and I'm just scared stiff when I think of going back to her.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you won't have to. Perhaps we'll be able to think of a way out.\nLet's both ask God to keep you from having to go back to Mrs. Wiley. You\nsay your prayers, don't you Mary?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I always go over an old rhyme 'fore I get into bed,\" said Mary\nindifferently. \"I never thought of asking for anything in particular\nthough. Nobody in this world ever bothered themselves about me so I\ndidn't s'pose God would. He MIGHT take more trouble for you, seeing\nyou're a minister's daughter.\"\n\n\"He'd take every bit as much trouble for you, Mary, I'm sure,\" said Una.\n\"It doesn't matter whose child you are. You just ask Him--and I will,\ntoo.\"\n\n\"All right,\" agreed Mary. \"It won't do any harm if it doesn't do much\ngood. If you knew Mrs. Wiley as well as I do you wouldn't think God\nwould want to meddle with her. Anyhow, I won't cry any more about it.\nThis is a big sight better'n last night down in that old barn, with the\nmice running about. Look at the Four Winds light. Ain't it pretty?\"\n\n\"This is the only window we can see it from,\" said Una. \"I love to watch\nit.\"\n\n\"Do you? So do I. I could see it from the Wiley loft and it was the only\ncomfort I had. When I was all sore from being licked I'd watch it and\nforget about the places that hurt. I'd think of the ships sailing\naway and away from it and wish I was on one of them sailing far away\ntoo--away from everything. On winter nights when it didn't shine, I just\nfelt real lonesome. Say, Una, what makes all you folks so kind to me\nwhen I'm just a stranger?\"\n\n\"Because it's right to be. The bible tells us to be kind to everybody.\"\n\n\"Does it? Well, I guess most folks don't mind it much then. I never\nremember of any one being kind to me before--true's you live I don't.\nSay, Una, ain't them shadows on the walls pretty? They look just like\na flock of little dancing birds. And say, Una, I like all you folks and\nthem Blythe boys and Di, but I don't like that Nan. She's a proud one.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Mary, she isn't a bit proud,\" said Una eagerly. \"Not a single\nbit.\"\n\n\"Don't tell me. Any one that holds her head like that IS proud. I don't\nlike her.\"\n\n\"WE all like her very much.\"\n\n\"Oh, I s'pose you like her better'n me?\" said Mary jealously. \"Do you?\"\n\n\"Why, Mary--we've known her for weeks and we've only known you a few\nhours,\" stammered Una.\n\n\"So you do like her better then?\" said Mary in a rage. \"All right! Like\nher all you want to. _I_ don't care. _I_ can get along without you.\"\n\nShe flung herself over against the wall of the garret with a slam.\n\n\"Oh, Mary,\" said Una, pushing a tender arm over Mary's uncompromising\nback, \"don't talk like that. I DO like you ever so much. And you make me\nfeel so bad.\"\n\nNo answer. Presently Una gave a sob. Instantly Mary squirmed around\nagain and engulfed Una in a bear's hug.\n\n\"Hush up,\" she ordered. \"Don't go crying over what I said. I was as mean\nas the devil to talk that way. I orter to be skinned alive--and you\nall so good to me. I should think you WOULD like any one better'n me. I\ndeserve every licking I ever got. Hush, now. If you cry any more I'll\ngo and walk right down to the harbour in this night-dress and drown\nmyself.\"\n\nThis terrible threat made Una choke back her sobs. Her tears were wiped\naway by Mary with the lace frill of the spare-room pillow and forgiver\nand forgiven cuddled down together again, harmony restored, to watch the\nshadows of the vine leaves on the moonlit wall until they fell asleep.\n\nAnd in the study below Rev. John Meredith walked the floor with rapt\nface and shining eyes, thinking out his message of the morrow, and knew\nnot that under his own roof there was a little forlorn soul, stumbling\nin darkness and ignorance, beset by terror and compassed about with\ndifficulties too great for it to grapple in its unequal struggle with a\nbig indifferent world.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. MARY STAYS AT THE MANSE\n\nThe manse children took Mary Vance to church with them the next day. At\nfirst Mary objected to the idea.\n\n\"Didn't you go to church over-harbour?\" asked Una.\n\n\"You bet. Mrs. Wiley never troubled church much, but I went every Sunday\nI could get off. I was mighty thankful to go to some place where I\ncould sit down for a spell. But I can't go to church in this old ragged\ndress.\"\n\nThis difficulty was removed by Faith offering the loan of her second\nbest dress.\n\n\"It's faded a little and two of the buttons are off, but I guess it'll\ndo.\"\n\n\"I'll sew the buttons on in a jiffy,\" said Mary.\n\n\"Not on Sunday,\" said Una, shocked.\n\n\"Sure. The better the day the better the deed. You just gimme a needle\nand thread and look the other way if you're squeamish.\"\n\nFaith's school boots, and an old black velvet cap that had once been\nCecilia Meredith's, completed Mary's costume, and to church she went.\nHer behaviour was quite conventional, and though some wondered who the\nshabby little girl with the manse children was she did not attract much\nattention. She listened to the sermon with outward decorum and joined\nlustily in the singing. She had, it appeared, a clear, strong voice and\na good ear.\n\n\"His blood can make the VIOLETS clean,\" carolled Mary blithely. Mrs.\nJimmy Milgrave, whose pew was just in front of the manse pew, turned\nsuddenly and looked the child over from top to toe. Mary, in a mere\nsuperfluity of naughtiness, stuck out her tongue at Mrs. Milgrave, much\nto Una's horror.\n\n\"I couldn't help it,\" she declared after church. \"What'd she want to\nstare at me like that for? Such manners! I'm GLAD stuck my tongue out\nat her. I wish I'd stuck it farther out. Say, I saw Rob MacAllister from\nover-harbour there. Wonder if he'll tell Mrs. Wiley on me.\"\n\nNo Mrs. Wiley appeared, however, and in a few day the children forgot\nto look for her. Mary was apparently a fixture at the manse. But she\nrefused to go to school with the others.\n\n\"Nope. I've finished my education,\" she said, when Faith urged her to\ngo. \"I went to school four winters since I come to Mrs. Wiley's and I've\nhad all I want of THAT. I'm sick and tired of being everlastingly\njawed at 'cause I didn't get my home-lessons done. I'D no time to do\nhome-lessons.\"\n\n\"Our teacher won't jaw you. He is awfully nice,\" said Faith.\n\n\"Well, I ain't going. I can read and write and cipher up to fractions.\nThat's all I want. You fellows go and I'll stay home. You needn't be\nscared I'll steal anything. I swear I'm honest.\"\n\nMary employed herself while the others were at school in cleaning up\nthe manse. In a few days it was a different place. Floors were swept,\nfurniture dusted, everything straightened out. She mended the spare-room\nbed-tick, she sewed on missing buttons, she patched clothes neatly, she\neven invaded the study with broom and dustpan and ordered Mr. Meredith\nout while she put it to rights. But there was one department with which\nAunt Martha refused to let her interfere. Aunt Martha might be deaf\nand half blind and very childish, but she was resolved to keep the\ncommissariat in her own hands, in spite of all Mary's wiles and\nstratagems.\n\n\"I can tell you if old Martha'd let ME cook you'd have some decent\nmeals,\" she told the manse children indignantly. \"There'd be no more\n'ditto'--and no more lumpy porridge and blue milk either. What DOES she\ndo with all the cream?\"\n\n\"She gives it to the cat. He's hers, you know,\" said Faith.\n\n\"I'd like to CAT her,\" exclaimed Mary bitterly. \"I've no use for cats\nanyhow. They belong to the old Nick. You can tell that by their eyes.\nWell, if old Martha won't, she won't, I s'pose. But it gits on my nerves\nto see good vittles spoiled.\"\n\nWhen school came out they always went to Rainbow Valley. Mary refused to\nplay in the graveyard. She declared she was afraid of ghosts.\n\n\"There's no such thing as ghosts,\" declared Jem Blythe.\n\n\"Oh, ain't there?\"\n\n\"Did you ever see any?\"\n\n\"Hundreds of 'em,\" said Mary promptly.\n\n\"What are they like?\" said Carl.\n\n\"Awful-looking. Dressed all in white with skellington hands and heads,\"\nsaid Mary.\n\n\"What did you do?\" asked Una.\n\n\"Run like the devil,\" said Mary. Then she caught Walter's eyes and\nblushed. Mary was a good deal in awe of Walter. She declared to the\nmanse girls that his eyes made her nervous.\n\n\"I think of all the lies I've ever told when I look into them,\" she\nsaid, \"and I wish I hadn't.\"\n\nJem was Mary's favourite. When he took her to the attic at Ingleside and\nshowed her the museum of curios that Captain Jim Boyd had bequeathed to\nhim she was immensely pleased and flattered. She also won Carl's heart\nentirely by her interest in his beetles and ants. It could not be denied\nthat Mary got on rather better with the boys than with the girls. She\nquarrelled bitterly with Nan Blythe the second day.\n\n\"Your mother is a witch,\" she told Nan scornfully. \"Red-haired women\nare always witches.\" Then she and Faith fell out about the rooster. Mary\nsaid its tail was too short. Faith angrily retorted that she guessed God\nknow what length to make a rooster's tail. They did not \"speak\" for\na day over this. Mary treated Una's hairless, one-eyed doll with\nconsideration; but when Una showed her other prized treasure--a picture\nof an angel carrying a baby, presumably to heaven, Mary declared that\nit looked too much like a ghost for her. Una crept away to her room and\ncried over this, but Mary hunted her out, hugged her repentantly and\nimplored forgiveness. No one could keep up a quarrel long with Mary--not\neven Nan, who was rather prone to hold grudges and never quite forgave\nthe insult to her mother. Mary was jolly. She could and did tell the\nmost thrilling ghost stories. Rainbow Valley seances were undeniably\nmore exciting after Mary came. She learned to play on the jew's-harp and\nsoon eclipsed Jerry.\n\n\"Never struck anything yet I couldn't do if I put my mind to it,\" she\ndeclared. Mary seldom lost a chance of tooting her own horn. She\ntaught them how to make \"blow-bags\" out of the thick leaves of the\n\"live-forever\" that flourished in the old Bailey garden, she initiated\nthem into the toothsome qualities of the \"sours\" that grew in the niches\nof the graveyard dyke, and she could make the most wonderful shadow\npictures on the walls with her long, flexible fingers. And when they all\nwent picking gum in Rainbow Valley Mary always got \"the biggest chew\"\nand bragged about it. There were times when they hated her and times\nwhen they loved her. But at all times they found her interesting.\nSo they submitted quite meekly to her bossing, and by the end of a\nfortnight had come to feel that she must always have been with them.\n\n\"It's the queerest thing that Mrs. Wiley hain't been after me,\" said\nMary. \"I can't understand it.\"\n\n\"Maybe she isn't going to bother about you at all,\" said Una. \"Then you\ncan just go on staying here.\"\n\n\"This house ain't hardly big enough for me and old Martha,\" said Mary\ndarkly. \"It's a very fine thing to have enough to eat--I've often\nwondered what it would be like--but I'm p'ticler about my cooking. And\nMrs. Wiley'll be here yet. SHE'S got a rod in pickle for me all right. I\ndon't think about it so much in daytime but say, girls, up there in that\ngarret at night I git to thinking and thinking of it, till I just almost\nwish she'd come and have it over with. I dunno's one real good whipping\nwould be much worse'n all the dozen I've lived through in my mind ever\nsince I run away. Were any of you ever licked?\"\n\n\"No, of course not,\" said Faith indignantly. \"Father would never do such\na thing.\"\n\n\"You don't know you're alive,\" said Mary with a sigh half of envy, half\nof superiority. \"You don't know what I've come through. And I s'pose the\nBlythes were never licked either?\"\n\n\"No-o-o, I guess not. But I THINK they were sometimes spanked when they\nwere small.\"\n\n\"A spanking doesn't amount to anything,\" said Mary contemptuously. \"If\nmy folks had just spanked me I'd have thought they were petting\nme. Well, it ain't a fair world. I wouldn't mind taking my share of\nwallopings but I've had a darn sight too many.\"\n\n\"It isn't right to say that word, Mary,\" said Una reproachfully. \"You\npromised me you wouldn't say it.\"\n\n\"G'way,\" responded Mary. \"If you knew some of the words I COULD say if I\nliked you wouldn't make such a fuss over darn. And you know very well I\nhain't ever told any lies since I come here.\"\n\n\"What about all those ghosts you said you saw?\" asked Faith.\n\nMary blushed.\n\n\"That was diff'runt,\" she said defiantly. \"I knew you wouldn't believe\nthem yarns and I didn't intend you to. And I really did see something\nqueer one night when I was passing the over-harbour graveyard, true's\nyou live. I dunno whether 'twas a ghost or Sandy Crawford's old white\nnag, but it looked blamed queer and I tell you I scooted at the rate of\nno man's business.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. A FISHY EPISODE\n\nRilla Blythe walked proudly, and perhaps a little primly, through the\nmain \"street\" of the Glen and up the manse hill, carefully carrying\na small basketful of early strawberries, which Susan had coaxed into\nlusciousness in one of the sunny nooks of Ingleside. Susan had charged\nRilla to give the basket to nobody except Aunt Martha or Mr. Meredith,\nand Rilla, very proud of being entrusted with such an errand, was\nresolved to carry out her instructions to the letter.\n\nSusan had dressed her daintily in a white, starched, and embroidered\ndress, with sash of blue and beaded slippers. Her long ruddy curls\nwere sleek and round, and Susan had let her put on her best hat, out\nof compliment to the manse. It was a somewhat elaborate affair, wherein\nSusan's taste had had more to say than Anne's, and Rilla's small soul\ngloried in its splendours of silk and lace and flowers. She was very\nconscious of her hat, and I am afraid she strutted up the manse hill.\nThe strut, or the hat, or both, got on the nerves of Mary Vance, who was\nswinging on the lawn gate. Mary's temper was somewhat ruffled just then,\ninto the bargain. Aunt Martha had refused to let her peel the potatoes\nand had ordered her out of the kitchen.\n\n\"Yah! You'll bring the potatoes to the table with strips of skin hanging\nto them and half boiled as usual! My, but it'll be nice to go to your\nfuneral,\" shrieked Mary. She went out of the kitchen, giving the door\nsuch a bang that even Aunt Martha heard it, and Mr. Meredith in his\nstudy felt the vibration and thought absently that there must have been\na slight earthquake shock. Then he went on with his sermon.\n\nMary slipped from the gate and confronted the spick-and-span damsel of\nIngleside.\n\n\"What you got there?\" she demanded, trying to take the basket.\n\nRilla resisted. \"It'th for Mithter Meredith,\" she lisped.\n\n\"Give it to me. I'LL give it to him,\" said Mary.\n\n\"No. Thuthan thaid that I wathn't to give it to anybody but Mithter\nMer'dith or Aunt Martha,\" insisted Rilla.\n\nMary eyed her sourly.\n\n\"You think you're something, don't you, all dressed up like a doll! Look\nat me. My dress is all rags and _I_ don't care! I'd rather be ragged\nthan a doll baby. Go home and tell them to put you in a glass case. Look\nat me--look at me--look at me!\"\n\nMary executed a wild dance around the dismayed and bewildered Rilla,\nflirting her ragged skirt and vociferating \"Look at me--look at me\"\nuntil poor Rilla was dizzy. But as the latter tried to edge away towards\nthe gate Mary pounced on her again.\n\n\"You give me that basket,\" she ordered with a grimace. Mary was past\nmistress in the art of \"making faces.\" She could give her countenance\na most grotesque and unearthly appearance out of which her strange,\nbrilliant, white eyes gleamed with weird effect.\n\n\"I won't,\" gasped Rilla, frightened but staunch. \"You let me go, Mary\nVanth.\"\n\nMary let go for a minute and looked around here. Just inside the gate\nwas a small \"flake,\" on which a half a dozen large codfish were drying.\nOne of Mr. Meredith's parishioners had presented him with them one\nday, perhaps in lieu of the subscription he was supposed to pay to the\nstipend and never did. Mr. Meredith had thanked him and then forgotten\nall about the fish, which would have promptly spoiled had not the\nindefatigable Mary prepared them for drying and rigged up the \"flake\"\nherself on which to dry them.\n\nMary had a diabolical inspiration. She flew to the \"flake\" and seized\nthe largest fish there--a huge, flat thing, nearly as big as herself.\nWith a whoop she swooped down on the terrified Rilla, brandishing her\nweird missile. Rilla's courage gave way. To be lambasted with a dried\ncodfish was such an unheard-of thing that Rilla could not face it. With\na shriek she dropped her basket and fled. The beautiful berries, which\nSusan had so tenderly selected for the minister, rolled in a rosy\ntorrent over the dusty road and were trodden on by the flying feet of\npursuer and pursued. The basket and contents were no longer in Mary's\nmind. She thought only of the delight of giving Rilla Blythe the scare\nof her life. She would teach HER to come giving herself airs because of\nher fine clothes.\n\nRilla flew down the hill and along the street. Terror lent wings to\nher feet, and she just managed to keep ahead of Mary, who was somewhat\nhampered by her own laughter, but who had breath enough to give\noccasional blood-curdling whoops as she ran, flourishing her codfish in\nthe air. Through the Glen street they swept, while everybody ran to the\nwindows and gates to see them. Mary felt she was making a tremendous\nsensation and enjoyed it. Rilla, blind with terror and spent of breath,\nfelt that she could run no longer. In another instant that terrible girl\nwould be on her with the codfish. At this point the poor mite stumbled\nand fell into the mud-puddle at the end of the street just as Miss\nCornelia came out of Carter Flagg's store.\n\nMiss Cornelia took the whole situation in at a glance. So did Mary. The\nlatter stopped short in her mad career and before Miss Cornelia could\nspeak she had whirled around and was running up as fast as she had run\ndown. Miss Cornelia's lips tightened ominously, but she knew it was no\nuse to think of chasing her. So she picked up poor, sobbing, dishevelled\nRilla instead and took her home. Rilla was heart-broken. Her dress and\nslippers and hat were ruined and her six year old pride had received\nterrible bruises.\n\nSusan, white with indignation, heard Miss Cornelia's story of Mary\nVance's exploit.\n\n\"Oh, the hussy--oh, the littly hussy!\" she said, as she carried Rilla\naway for purification and comfort.\n\n\"This thing has gone far enough, Anne dearie,\" said Miss Cornelia\nresolutely. \"Something must be done. WHO is this creature who is staying\nat the manse and where does she come from?\"\n\n\"I understood she was a little girl from over-harbour who was visiting\nat the manse,\" answered Anne, who saw the comical side of the codfish\nchase and secretly thought Rilla was rather vain and needed a lesson or\ntwo.\n\n\"I know all the over-harbour families who come to our church and that\nimp doesn't belong to any of them,\" retorted Miss Cornelia. \"She is\nalmost in rags and when she goes to church she wears Faith Meredith's\nold clothes. There's some mystery here, and I'm going to investigate\nit, since it seems nobody else will. I believe she was at the bottom of\ntheir goings-on in Warren Mead's spruce bush the other day. Did you hear\nof their frightening his mother into a fit?\"\n\n\"No. I knew Gilbert had been called to see her, but I did not hear what\nthe trouble was.\"\n\n\"Well, you know she has a weak heart. And one day last week, when\nshe was all alone on the veranda, she heard the most awful shrieks of\n'murder' and 'help' coming from the bush--positively frightful sounds,\nAnne dearie. Her heart gave out at once. Warren heard them himself at\nthe barn, and went straight to the bush to investigate, and there he\nfound all the manse children sitting on a fallen tree and screaming\n'murder' at the top of their lungs. They told him they were only in fun\nand didn't think anyone would hear them. They were just playing\nIndian ambush. Warren went back to the house and found his poor mother\nunconscious on the veranda.\"\n\nSusan, who had returned, sniffed contemptuously.\n\n\"I think she was very far from being unconscious, Mrs. Marshall Elliott,\nand that you may tie to. I have been hearing of Amelia Warren's weak\nheart for forty years. She had it when she was twenty. She enjoys making\na fuss and having the doctor, and any excuse will do.\"\n\n\"I don't think Gilbert thought her attack very serious,\" said Anne.\n\n\"Oh, that may very well be,\" said Miss Cornelia. \"But the matter has\nmade an awful lot of talk and the Meads being Methodists makes it that\nmuch worse. What is going to become of those children? Sometimes I\ncan't sleep at nights for thinking about them, Anne dearie. I really do\nquestion if they get enough to eat, even, for their father is so lost\nin dreams that he doesn't often remember he has a stomach, and that lazy\nold woman doesn't bother cooking what she ought. They are just running\nwild and now that school is closing they'll be worse than ever.\"\n\n\"They do have jolly times,\" said Anne, laughing over the recollections\nof some Rainbow Valley happenings that had come to her ears. \"And they\nare all brave and frank and loyal and truthful.\"\n\n\"That's a true word, Anne dearie, and when you come to think of all the\ntrouble in the church those two tattling, deceitful youngsters of\nthe last minister's made, I'm inclined to overlook a good deal in the\nMerediths.\"\n\n\"When all is said and done, Mrs. Dr. dear, they are very nice children,\"\nsaid Susan. \"They have got plenty of original sin in them and that I\nwill admit, but maybe it is just as well, for if they had not they might\nspoil from over-sweetness. Only I do think it is not proper for them to\nplay in a graveyard and that I will maintain.\"\n\n\"But they really play quite quietly there,\" excused Anne. \"They don't\nrun and yell as they do elsewhere. Such howls as drift up here from\nRainbow Valley sometimes! Though I fancy my own small fry bear a valiant\npart in them. They had a sham battle there last night and had to 'roar'\nthemselves, because they had no artillery to do it, so Jem says. Jem is\npassing through the stage where all boys hanker to be soldiers.\"\n\n\"Well, thank goodness, he'll never be a soldier,\" said Miss Cornelia. \"I\nnever approved of our boys going to that South African fracas. But it's\nover, and not likely anything of the kind will ever happen again. I\nthink the world is getting more sensible. As for the Merediths, I've\nsaid many a time and I say it again, if Mr. Meredith had a wife all\nwould be well.\"\n\n\"He called twice at the Kirks' last week, so I am told,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Well,\" said Miss Cornelia thoughtfully, \"as a rule, I don't approve of\na minister marrying in his congregation. It generally spoils him. But\nin this case it would do no harm, for every one likes Elizabeth Kirk and\nnobody else is hankering for the job of stepmothering those youngsters.\nEven the Hill girls balk at that. They haven't been found laying traps\nfor Mr. Meredith. Elizabeth would make him a good wife if he only\nthought so. But the trouble is, she really is homely and, Anne dearie,\nMr. Meredith, abstracted as he is, has an eye for a good-looking woman,\nman-like. He isn't SO other-worldly when it comes to that, believe ME.\"\n\n\"Elizabeth Kirk is a very nice person, but they do say that people have\nnearly frozen to death in her mother's spare-room bed before now, Mrs.\nDr. dear,\" said Susan darkly. \"If I felt I had any right to express an\nopinion concerning such a solemn matter as a minister's marriage I would\nsay that I think Elizabeth's cousin Sarah, over-harbour, would make Mr.\nMeredith a better wife.\"\n\n\"Why, Sarah Kirk is a Methodist,\" said Miss Cornelia, much as if Susan\nhad suggested a Hottentot as a manse bride.\n\n\"She would likely turn Presbyterian if she married Mr. Meredith,\"\nretorted Susan.\n\nMiss Cornelia shook her head. Evidently with her it was, once a\nMethodist, always a Methodist.\n\n\"Sarah Kirk is entirely out of the question,\" she said positively. \"And\nso is Emmeline Drew--though the Drews are all trying to make the match.\nThey are literally throwing poor Emmeline at his head, and he hasn't the\nleast idea of it.\"\n\n\"Emmeline Drew has no gumption, I must allow,\" said Susan. \"She is the\nkind of woman, Mrs. Dr. dear, who would put a hot-water bottle in your\nbed on a dog-night and then have her feelings hurt because you were not\ngrateful. And her mother was a very poor housekeeper. Did you ever hear\nthe story of her dishcloth? She lost her dishcloth one day. But the next\nday she found it. Oh, yes, Mrs. Dr. dear, she found it, in the goose at\nthe dinner-table, mixed up with the stuffing. Do you think a woman like\nthat would do for a minister's mother-in-law? I do not. But no doubt\nI would be better employed in mending little Jem's trousers than in\ntalking gossip about my neighbours. He tore them something scandalous\nlast night in Rainbow Valley.\"\n\n\"Where is Walter?\" asked Anne.\n\n\"He is up to no good, I fear, Mrs. Dr. dear. He is in the attic writing\nsomething in an exercise book. And he has not done as well in arithmetic\nthis term as he should, so the teacher tells me. Too well I know the\nreason why. He has been writing silly rhymes when he should have been\ndoing his sums. I am afraid that boy is going to be a poet, Mrs. Dr.\ndear.\"\n\n\"He is a poet now, Susan.\"\n\n\"Well, you take it real calm, Mrs. Dr. dear. I suppose it is the best\nway, when a person has the strength. I had an uncle who began by being\na poet and ended up by being a tramp. Our family were dreadfully ashamed\nof him.\"\n\n\"You don't seem to think very highly of poets, Susan,\" said Anne,\nlaughing.\n\n\"Who does, Mrs. Dr. dear?\" asked Susan in genuine astonishment.\n\n\"What about Milton and Shakespeare? And the poets of the Bible?\"\n\n\"They tell me Milton could not get along with his wife, and Shakespeare\nwas no more than respectable by times. As for the Bible, of course\nthings were different in those sacred days--although I never had a high\nopinion of King David, say what you will. I never knew any good to come\nof writing poetry, and I hope and pray that blessed boy will outgrow\nthe tendency. If he does not--we must see what emulsion of cod-liver oil\nwill do.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. MISS CORNELIA INTERVENES\n\nMiss Cornelia descended upon the manse the next day and cross-questioned\nMary, who, being a young person of considerable discernment and\nastuteness, told her story simple and truthfully, with an entire absence\nof complaint or bravado. Miss Cornelia was more favourably impressed\nthan she had expected to be, but deemed it her duty to be severe.\n\n\"Do you think,\" she said sternly, \"that you showed your gratitude to\nthis family, who have been far too kind to you, by insulting and chasing\none of their little friends as you did yesterday?\"\n\n\"Say, it was rotten mean of me,\" admitted Mary easily. \"I dunno what\npossessed me. That old codfish seemed to come in so blamed handy. But I\nwas awful sorry--I cried last night after I went to bed about it, honest\nI did. You ask Una if I didn't. I wouldn't tell her what for 'cause\nI was ashamed of it, and then she cried, too, because she was afraid\nsomeone had hurt my feelings. Laws, _I_ ain't got any feelings to hurt\nworth speaking of. What worries me is why Mrs. Wiley hain't been hunting\nfor me. It ain't like her.\"\n\nMiss Cornelia herself thought it rather peculiar, but she merely\nadmonished Mary sharply not to take any further liberties with the\nminister's codfish, and went to report progress at Ingleside.\n\n\"If the child's story is true the matter ought to be looked into,\" she\nsaid. \"I know something about that Wiley woman, believe ME. Marshall\nused to be well acquainted with her when he lived over-harbour. I heard\nhim say something last summer about her and a home child she had--likely\nthis very Mary-creature. He said some one told him she was working the\nchild to death and not half feeding and clothing it. You know, Anne\ndearie, it has always been my habit neither to make nor meddle with\nthose over-harbour folks. But I shall send Marshall over to-morrow\nto find out the rights of this if he can. And THEN I'll speak to the\nminister. Mind you, Anne dearie, the Merediths found this girl literally\nstarving in James Taylor's old hay barn. She had been there all night,\ncold and hungry and alone. And us sleeping warm in our beds after good\nsuppers.\"\n\n\"The poor little thing,\" said Anne, picturing one of her own dear\nbabies, cold and hungry and alone in such circumstances. \"If she has\nbeen ill-used, Miss Cornelia, she mustn't be taken back to such a place.\n_I_ was an orphan once in a very similar situation.\"\n\n\"We'll have to consult the Hopetown asylum folks,\" said Miss Cornelia.\n\"Anyway, she can't be left at the manse. Dear knows what those poor\nchildren might learn from her. I understand that she has been known to\nswear. But just think of her being there two whole weeks and Mr Meredith\nnever waking up to it! What business has a man like that to have a\nfamily? Why, Anne dearie, he ought to be a monk.\"\n\nTwo evenings later Miss Cornelia was back at Ingleside.\n\n\"It's the most amazing thing!\" she said. \"Mrs. Wiley was found dead in\nher bed the very morning after this Mary-creature ran away. She has had\na bad heart for years and the doctor had warned her it might happen at\nany time. She had sent away her hired man and there was nobody in the\nhouse. Some neighbours found her the next day. They missed the child,\nit seems, but supposed Mrs. Wiley had sent her to her cousin near\nCharlottetown as she had said she was going to do. The cousin didn't\ncome to the funeral and so nobody ever knew that Mary wasn't with her.\nThe people Marshall talked to told him some things about the way Mrs.\nWiley used this Mary that made his blood boil, so he declares. You know,\nit puts Marshall in a regular fury to hear of a child being ill-used.\nThey said she whipped her mercilessly for every little fault or mistake.\nSome folks talked of writing to the asylum authorities but everybody's\nbusiness is nobody's business and it was never done.\"\n\n\"I am sorry that Wiley person is dead,\" said Susan fiercely. \"I should\nlike to go over-harbour and give her a piece of my mind. Starving\nand beating a child, Mrs. Dr. dear! As you know, I hold with lawful\nspanking, but I go no further. And what is to become of this poor child\nnow, Mrs. Marshall Elliott?\"\n\n\"I suppose she must be sent back to Hopetown,\" said Miss Cornelia. \"I\nthink every one hereabouts who wants a home child has one. I'll see Mr.\nMeredith to-morrow and tell him my opinion of the whole affair.\"\n\n\"And no doubt she will, Mrs. Dr. dear,\" said Susan, after Miss Cornelia\nhad gone. \"She would stick at nothing, not even at shingling the church\nspire if she took it into her head. But I cannot understand how even\nCornelia Bryant can talk to a minister as she does. You would think he\nwas just any common person.\"\n\nWhen Miss Cornelia had gone, Nan Blythe uncurled herself from the\nhammock where she had been studying her lessons and slipped away to\nRainbow Valley. The others were already there. Jem and Jerry were\nplaying quoits with old horseshoes borrowed from the Glen blacksmith.\nCarl was stalking ants on a sunny hillock. Walter, lying on his stomach\namong the fern, was reading aloud to Mary and Di and Faith and Una from\na wonderful book of myths wherein were fascinating accounts of Prester\nJohn and the Wandering Jew, divining rods and tailed men, of Schamir,\nthe worm that split rocks and opened the way to golden treasure, of\nFortunate Isles and swan-maidens. It was a great shock to Walter to\nlearn that William Tell and Gelert were myths also; and the story of\nBishop Hatto was to keep him awake all that night; but best of all he\nloved the stories of the Pied Piper and the San Greal. He read them\nthrillingly, while the bells on the Tree Lovers tinkled in the summer\nwind and the coolness of the evening shadows crept across the valley.\n\n\"Say, ain't them in'resting lies?\" said Mary admiringly when Walter had\nclosed the book.\n\n\"They aren't lies,\" said Di indignantly.\n\n\"You don't mean they're true?\" asked Mary incredulously.\n\n\"No--not exactly. They're like those ghost-stories of yours. They\nweren't true--but you didn't expect us to believe them, so they weren't\nlies.\"\n\n\"That yarn about the divining rod is no lie, anyhow,\" said Mary.\n\"Old Jake Crawford over-harbour can work it. They send for him from\neverywhere when they want to dig a well. And I believe I know the\nWandering Jew.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mary,\" said Una, awe-struck.\n\n\"I do--true's you're alive. There was an old man at Mrs. Wiley's one day\nlast fall. He looked old enough to be ANYTHING. She was asking him about\ncedar posts, if he thought they'd last well. And he said, 'Last well?\nThey'll last a thousand years. I know, for I've tried them twice.' Now,\nif he was two thousand years old who was he but your Wandering Jew?\"\n\n\"I don't believe the Wandering Jew would associate with a person like\nMrs. Wiley,\" said Faith decidedly.\n\n\"I love the Pied Piper story,\" said Di, \"and so does mother. I always\nfeel so sorry for the poor little lame boy who couldn't keep up with\nthe others and got shut out of the mountain. He must have been so\ndisappointed. I think all the rest of his life he'd be wondering what\nwonderful thing he had missed and wishing he could have got in with the\nothers.\"\n\n\"But how glad his mother must have been,\" said Una softly. \"I think she\nhad been sorry all her life that he was lame. Perhaps she even used to\ncry about it. But she would never be sorry again--never. She would be\nglad he was lame because that was why she hadn't lost him.\"\n\n\"Some day,\" said Walter dreamily, looking afar into the sky, \"the Pied\nPiper will come over the hill up there and down Rainbow Valley, piping\nmerrily and sweetly. And I will follow him--follow him down to the\nshore--down to the sea--away from you all. I don't think I'll want to\ngo--Jem will want to go--it will be such an adventure--but I won't.\nOnly I'll HAVE to--the music will call and call and call me until I MUST\nfollow.\"\n\n\"We'll all go,\" cried Di, catching fire at the flame of Walter's fancy,\nand half-believing she could see the mocking, retreating figure of the\nmystic piper in the far, dim end of the valley.\n\n\"No. You'll sit here and wait,\" said Walter, his great, splendid eyes\nfull of strange glamour. \"You'll wait for us to come back. And we may\nnot come--for we cannot come as long as the Piper plays. He may pipe us\nround the world. And still you'll sit here and wait--and WAIT.\"\n\n\"Oh, dry up,\" said Mary, shivering. \"Don't look like that, Walter\nBlythe. You give me the creeps. Do you want to set me bawling? I could\njust see that horrid old Piper going away on, and you boys following\nhim, and us girls sitting here waiting all alone. I dunno why it is--I\nnever was one of the blubbering kind--but as soon as you start your\nspieling I always want to cry.\"\n\nWalter smiled in triumph. He liked to exercise this power of his over\nhis companions--to play on their feelings, waken their fears, thrill\ntheir souls. It satisfied some dramatic instinct in him. But under his\ntriumph was a queer little chill of some mysterious dread. The Pied\nPiper had seemed very real to him--as if the fluttering veil that hid\nthe future had for a moment been blown aside in the starlit dusk of\nRainbow Valley and some dim glimpse of coming years granted to him.\n\nCarl, coming up to their group with a report of the doings in ant-land,\nbrought them all back to the realm of facts.\n\n\"Ants ARE darned in'resting,\" exclaimed Mary, glad to escape the shadowy\nPiper's thrall. \"Carl and me watched that bed in the graveyard all\nSaturday afternoon. I never thought there was so much in bugs. Say, but\nthey're quarrelsome little cusses--some of 'em like to start a fight\n'thout any reason, far's we could see. And some of 'em are cowards. They\ngot so scared they just doubled theirselves up into a ball and let the\nother fellows bang 'em. They wouldn't put up a fight at all. Some of 'em\nare lazy and won't work. We watched 'em shirking. And there was one ant\ndied of grief 'cause another ant got killed--wouldn't work--wouldn't\neat--just died--it did, honest to Go--oodness.\"\n\nA shocked silence prevailed. Every one knew that Mary had not started\nout to say \"goodness.\" Faith and Di exchanged glances that would\nhave done credit to Miss Cornelia herself. Walter and Carl looked\nuncomfortable and Una's lip trembled.\n\nMary squirmed uncomfortably.\n\n\"That slipped out 'fore I thought--it did, honest to--I mean, true's\nyou live, and I swallowed half of it. You folks over here are mighty\nsqueamish seems to me. Wish you could have heard the Wileys when they\nhad a fight.\"\n\n\"Ladies don't say such things,\" said Faith, very primly for her.\n\n\"It isn't right,\" whispered Una.\n\n\"I ain't a lady,\" said Mary. \"What chance've I ever had of being a lady?\nBut I won't say that again if I can help it. I promise you.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" said Una, \"you can't expect God to answer your prayers if you\ntake His name in vain, Mary.\"\n\n\"I don't expect Him to answer 'em anyhow,\" said Mary of little faith.\n\"I've been asking Him for a week to clear up this Wiley affair and He\nhasn't done a thing. I'm going to give up.\"\n\nAt this juncture Nan arrived breathless.\n\n\"Oh, Mary, I've news for you. Mrs. Elliott has been over-harbour and\nwhat do you think she found out? Mrs. Wiley is dead--she was found dead\nin bed the morning after you ran away. So you'll never have to go back\nto her.\"\n\n\"Dead!\" said Mary stupefied. Then she shivered.\n\n\"Do you s'pose my praying had anything to do with that?\" she cried\nimploringly to Una. \"If it had I'll never pray again as long as I live.\nWhy, she may come back and ha'nt me.\"\n\n\"No, no, Mary,\" said Una comfortingly, \"it hadn't. Why, Mrs. Wiley died\nlong before you ever began to pray about it at all.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" said Mary recovering from her panic. \"But I tell you it\ngave me a start. I wouldn't like to think I'd prayed anybody to death.\nI never thought of such a thing as her dying when I was praying. She\ndidn't seem much like the dying kind. Did Mrs. Elliott say anything\nabout me?\"\n\n\"She said you would likely have to go back to the asylum.\"\n\n\"I thought as much,\" said Mary drearily. \"And then they'll give me out\nagain--likely to some one just like Mrs. Wiley. Well, I s'pose I can\nstand it. I'm tough.\"\n\n\"I'm going to pray that you won't have to go back,\" whispered Una, as\nshe and Mary walked home to the manse.\n\n\"You can do as you like,\" said Mary decidedly, \"but I vow _I_ won't. I'm\ngood and scared of this praying business. See what's come of it. If Mrs.\nWiley HAD died after I started praying it would have been my doings.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, it wouldn't,\" said Una. \"I wish I could explain things\nbetter--father could, I know, if you'd talk to him, Mary.\"\n\n\"Catch me! I don't know what to make of your father, that's the long and\nshort of it. He goes by me and never sees me in broad daylight. I ain't\nproud--but I ain't a door-mat, neither!\"\n\n\"Oh, Mary, it's just father's way. Most of the time he never sees us,\neither. He is thinking deeply, that is all. And I AM going to pray that\nGod will keep you in Four Winds--because I like you, Mary.\"\n\n\"All right. Only don't let me hear of any more people dying on account\nof it,\" said Mary. \"I'd like to stay in Four Winds fine. I like it and\nI like the harbour and the light house--and you and the Blythes. You're\nthe only friends I ever had and I'd hate to leave you.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. UNA INTERVENES\n\nMiss Cornelia had an interview with Mr. Meredith which proved something\nof a shock to that abstracted gentleman. She pointed out to him, none\ntoo respectfully, his dereliction of duty in allowing a waif like Mary\nVance to come into his family and associate with his children without\nknowing or learning anything about her.\n\n\"I don't say there is much harm done, of course,\" she concluded. \"This\nMary-creature isn't what you might call bad, when all is said and done.\nI've been questioning your children and the Blythes, and from what I can\nmake out there's nothing much to be said against the child except that\nshe's slangy and doesn't use very refined language. But think what might\nhave happened if she'd been like some of those home children we know of.\nYou know yourself what that poor little creature the Jim Flaggs' had,\ntaught and told the Flagg children.\"\n\nMr. Meredith did know and was honestly shocked over his own carelessness\nin the matter.\n\n\"But what is to be done, Mrs. Elliott?\" he asked helplessly. \"We can't\nturn the poor child out. She must be cared for.\"\n\n\"Of course. We'd better write to the Hopetown authorities at once.\nMeanwhile, I suppose she might as well stay here for a few more days\ntill we hear from them. But keep your eyes and ears open, Mr. Meredith.\"\n\nSusan would have died of horror on the spot if she had heard Miss\nCornelia so admonishing a minister. But Miss Cornelia departed in a warm\nglow of satisfaction over duty done, and that night Mr. Meredith asked\nMary to come into his study with him. Mary obeyed, looking literally\nghastly with fright. But she got the surprise of her poor, battered\nlittle life. This man, of whom she had stood so terribly in awe, was the\nkindest, gentlest soul she had ever met. Before she knew what happened\nMary found herself pouring all her troubles into his ear and receiving\nin return such sympathy and tender understanding as it had never\noccurred to her to imagine. Mary left the study with her face and eyes\nso softened that Una hardly knew her.\n\n\"Your father's all right, when he does wake up,\" she said with a sniff\nthat just escaped being a sob. \"It's a pity he doesn't wake up oftener.\nHe said I wasn't to blame for Mrs. Wiley dying, but that I must try\nto think of her good points and not of her bad ones. I dunno what\ngood points she had, unless it was keeping her house clean and making\nfirst-class butter. I know I 'most wore my arms out scrubbing her old\nkitchen floor with the knots in it. But anything your father says goes\nwith me after this.\"\n\nMary proved a rather dull companion in the following days, however. She\nconfided to Una that the more she thought of going back to the asylum\nthe more she hated it. Una racked her small brains for some way of\naverting it, but it was Nan Blythe who came to the rescue with a\nsomewhat startling suggestion.\n\n\"Mrs. Elliott might take Mary herself. She has a great big house and Mr.\nElliott is always wanting her to have help. It would be just a splendid\nplace for Mary. Only she'd have to behave herself.\"\n\n\"Oh, Nan, do you think Mrs. Elliott would take her?\"\n\n\"It wouldn't do any harm if you asked her,\" said Nan. At first Una did\nnot think she could. She was so shy that to ask a favour of anybody was\nagony to her. And she was very much in awe of the bustling, energetic\nMrs. Elliott. She liked her very much and always enjoyed a visit to her\nhouse; but to go and ask her to adopt Mary Vance seemed such a height of\npresumption that Una's timid spirit quailed.\n\nWhen the Hopetown authorities wrote to Mr. Meredith to send Mary to them\nwithout delay Mary cried herself to sleep in the manse attic that night\nand Una found a desperate courage. The next evening she slipped away\nfrom the manse to the harbour road. Far down in Rainbow Valley she heard\njoyous laughter but her way lay not there. She was terribly pale and\nterribly in earnest--so much so that she took no notice of the people\nshe met--and old Mrs. Stanley Flagg was quite huffed and said Una\nMeredith would be as absentminded as her father when she grew up.\n\nMiss Cornelia lived half way between the Glen and Four Winds Point, in a\nhouse whose original glaring green hue had mellowed down to an agreeable\ngreenish gray. Marshall Elliott had planted trees about it and set out a\nrose garden and a spruce hedge. It was quite a different place from\nwhat it had been in years agone. The manse children and the Ingleside\nchildren liked to go there. It was a beautiful walk down the old harbour\nroad, and there was always a well-filled cooky jar at the end.\n\nThe misty sea was lapping softly far down on the sands. Three big boats\nwere skimming down the harbour like great white sea-birds. A schooner\nwas coming up the channel. The world of Four Winds was steeped in\nglowing colour, and subtle music, and strange glamour, and everybody\nshould have been happy in it. But when Una turned in at Miss Cornelia's\ngate her very legs had almost refused to carry her.\n\nMiss Cornelia was alone on the veranda. Una had hoped Mr. Elliott would\nbe there. He was so big and hearty and twinkly that there would be\nencouragement in his presence. She sat on the little stool Miss Cornelia\nbrought out and tried to eat the doughnut Miss Cornelia gave her. It\nstuck in her throat, but she swallowed desperately lest Miss Cornelia be\noffended. She could not talk; she was still pale; and her big, dark-blue\neyes looked so piteous that Miss Cornelia concluded the child was in\nsome trouble.\n\n\"What's on your mind, dearie?\" she asked. \"There's something, that's\nplain to be seen.\"\n\nUna swallowed the last twist of doughnut with a desperate gulp.\n\n\"Mrs. Elliott, won't you take Mary Vance?\" she said beseechingly.\n\nMiss Cornelia stared blankly.\n\n\"Me! Take Mary Vance! Do you mean keep her?\"\n\n\"Yes--keep her--adopt her,\" said Una eagerly, gaining courage now that\nthe ice was broken. \"Oh, Mrs. Elliott, PLEASE do. She doesn't want to go\nback to the asylum--she cries every night about it. She's so afraid\nof being sent to another hard place. And she's SO smart--there isn't\nanything she can't do. I know you wouldn't be sorry if you took her.\"\n\n\"I never thought of such a thing,\" said Miss Cornelia rather helplessly.\n\n\"WON'T you think of it?\" implored Una.\n\n\"But, dearie, I don't want help. I'm quite able to do all the work here.\nAnd I never thought I'd like to have a home girl if I did need help.\"\n\nThe light went out of Una's eyes. Her lips trembled. She sat down on her\nstool again, a pathetic little figure of disappointment, and began to\ncry.\n\n\"Don't--dearie--don't,\" exclaimed Miss Cornelia in distress. She could\nnever bear to hurt a child. \"I don't say I WON'T take her--but the idea\nis so new it has just kerflummuxed me. I must think it over.\"\n\n\"Mary is SO smart,\" said Una again.\n\n\"Humph! So I've heard. I've heard she swears, too. Is that true?\"\n\n\"I've never heard her swear EXACTLY,\" faltered Una uncomfortably. \"But\nI'm afraid she COULD.\"\n\n\"I believe you! Does she always tell the truth?\"\n\n\"I think she does, except when she's afraid of a whipping.\"\n\n\"And yet you want me to take her!\"\n\n\"SOME ONE has to take her,\" sobbed Una. \"SOME ONE has to look after her,\nMrs. Elliott.\"\n\n\"That's true. Perhaps it IS my duty to do it,\" said Miss Cornelia with\na sigh. \"Well, I'll have to talk it over with Mr. Elliott. So don't say\nanything about it just yet. Take another doughnut, dearie.\"\n\nUna took it and ate it with a better appetite.\n\n\"I'm very fond of doughnuts,\" she confessed \"Aunt Martha never makes\nany. But Miss Susan at Ingleside does, and sometimes she lets us have\na plateful in Rainbow Valley. Do you know what I do when I'm hungry for\ndoughnuts and can't get any, Mrs. Elliott?\"\n\n\"No, dearie. What?\"\n\n\"I get out mother's old cook book and read the doughnut recipe--and\nthe other recipes. They sound SO nice. I always do that when I'm\nhungry--especially after we've had ditto for dinner. THEN I read the\nfried chicken and the roast goose recipes. Mother could make all those\nnice things.\"\n\n\"Those manse children will starve to death yet if Mr. Meredith doesn't\nget married,\" Miss Cornelia told her husband indignantly after Una\nhad gone. \"And he won't--and what's to be done? And SHALL we take this\nMary-creature, Marshall?\"\n\n\"Yes, take her,\" said Marshall laconically.\n\n\"Just like a man,\" said his wife, despairingly. \"'Take her'--as if that\nwas all. There are a hundred things to be considered, believe ME.\"\n\n\"Take her--and we'll consider them afterwards, Cornelia,\" said her\nhusband.\n\nIn the end Miss Cornelia did take her and went up to announce her\ndecision to the Ingleside people first.\n\n\"Splendid!\" said Anne delightedly. \"I've been hoping you would do that\nvery thing, Miss Cornelia. I want that poor child to get a good home. I\nwas a homeless little orphan just like her once.\"\n\n\"I don't think this Mary-creature is or ever will be much like you,\"\nretorted Miss Cornelia gloomily. \"She's a cat of another colour. But\nshe's also a human being with an immortal soul to save. I've got a\nshorter catechism and a small tooth comb and I'm going to do my duty by\nher, now that I've set my hand to the plough, believe me.\"\n\nMary received the news with chastened satisfaction.\n\n\"It's better luck than I expected,\" she said.\n\n\"You'll have to mind your p's and q's with Mrs. Elliott,\" said Nan.\n\n\"Well, I can do that,\" flashed Mary. \"I know how to behave when I want\nto just as well as you, Nan Blythe.\"\n\n\"You mustn't use bad words, you know, Mary,\" said Una anxiously.\n\n\"I s'pose she'd die of horror if I did,\" grinned Mary, her white eyes\nshining with unholy glee over the idea. \"But you needn't worry, Una.\nButter won't melt in my mouth after this. I'll be all prunes and\nprisms.\"\n\n\"Nor tell lies,\" added Faith.\n\n\"Not even to get off from a whipping?\" pleaded Mary.\n\n\"Mrs. Elliott will NEVER whip you--NEVER,\" exclaimed Di.\n\n\"Won't she?\" said Mary skeptically. \"If I ever find myself in a place\nwhere I ain't licked I'll think it's heaven all right. No fear of me\ntelling lies then. I ain't fond of telling 'em--I'd ruther not, if it\ncomes to that.\"\n\nThe day before Mary's departure from the manse they had a picnic in her\nhonour in Rainbow Valley, and that evening all the manse children\ngave her something from their scanty store of treasured things for\na keepsake. Carl gave her his Noah's ark and Jerry his second best\njew's-harp. Faith gave her a little hairbrush with a mirror in the back\nof it, which Mary had always considered very wonderful. Una hesitated\nbetween an old beaded purse and a gay picture of Daniel in the lion's\nden, and finally offered Mary her choice. Mary really hankered after the\nbeaded purse, but she knew Una loved it, so she said,\n\n\"Give me Daniel. I'd rusher have it 'cause I'm partial to lions. Only I\nwish they'd et Daniel up. It would have been more exciting.\"\n\nAt bedtime Mary coaxed Una to sleep with her.\n\n\"It's for the last time,\" she said, \"and it's raining tonight, and\nI hate sleeping up there alone when it's raining on account of that\ngraveyard. I don't mind it on fine nights, but a night like this I can't\nsee anything but the rain pouring down on them old white stones, and the\nwind round the window sounds as if them dead people were trying to get\nin and crying 'cause they couldn't.\"\n\n\"I like rainy nights,\" said Una, when they were cuddled down together in\nthe little attic room, \"and so do the Blythe girls.\"\n\n\"I don't mind 'em when I'm not handy to graveyards,\" said Mary. \"If I\nwas alone here I'd cry my eyes out I'd be so lonesome. I feel awful bad\nto be leaving you all.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Elliott will let you come up and play in Rainbow Valley quite\noften I'm sure,\" said Una. \"And you WILL be a good girl, won't you,\nMary?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll try,\" sighed Mary. \"But it won't be as easy for me to be\ngood--inside, I mean, as well as outside--as it is for you. You hadn't\nsuch scalawags of relations as I had.\"\n\n\"But your people must have had some good qualities as well as bad ones,\"\nargued Una. \"You must live up to them and never mind their bad ones.\"\n\n\"I don't believe they had any good qualities,\" said Mary gloomily. \"I\nnever heard of any. My grandfather had money, but they say he was a\nrascal. No, I'll just have to start out on my own hook and do the best I\ncan.\"\n\n\"And God will help you, you know, Mary, if you ask Him.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mary. You know we asked God to get a home for you and He did.\"\n\n\"I don't see what He had to do with it,\" retorted Mary. \"It was you put\nit into Mrs. Elliott's head.\"\n\n\"But God put it into her HEART to take you. All my putting it into her\nHEAD wouldn't have done any good if He hadn't.\"\n\n\"Well, there may be something in that,\" admitted Mary. \"Mind you, I\nhaven't got anything against God, Una. I'm willing to give Him a\nchance. But, honest, I think He's an awful lot like your father--just\nabsent-minded and never taking any notice of a body most of the time,\nbut sometimes waking up all of a suddent and being awful good and kind\nand sensible.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mary, no!\" exclaimed horrified Una. \"God isn't a bit like father--I\nmean He's a thousand times better and kinder.\"\n\n\"If He's as good as your father He'll do for me,\" said Mary. \"When your\nfather was talking to me I felt as if I never could be bad any more.\"\n\n\"I wish you'd talk to father about Him,\" sighed Una. \"He can explain it\nall so much better than I can.\"\n\n\"Why, so I will, next time he wakes up,\" promised Mary. \"That night he\ntalked to me in the study he showed me real clear that my praying didn't\nkill Mrs. Wiley. My mind's been easy since, but I'm real cautious about\npraying. I guess the old rhyme is the safest. Say, Una, it seems to me\nif one has to pray to anybody it'd be better to pray to the devil than\nto God. God's good, anyhow so you say, so He won't do you any harm,\nbut from all I can make out the devil needs to be pacified. I think the\nsensible way would be to say to HIM, 'Good devil, please don't tempt me.\nJust leave me alone, please.' Now, don't you?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no, Mary. I'm sure it couldn't be right to pray to the devil.\nAnd it wouldn't do any good because he's bad. It might aggravate him and\nhe'd be worse than ever.\"\n\n\"Well, as to this God-matter,\" said Mary stubbornly, \"since you and I\ncan't settle it, there ain't no use in talking more about it until we've\na chanct to find out the rights of it. I'll do the best I can alone till\nthen.\"\n\n\"If mother was alive she could tell us everything,\" said Una with a\nsigh.\n\n\"I wisht she was alive,\" said Mary. \"I don't know what's going to become\nof you youngsters when I'm gone. Anyhow, DO try and keep the house a\nlittle tidy. The way people talks about it is scandalous. And the first\nthing you know your father will be getting married again and then your\nnoses will be out of joint.\"\n\nUna was startled. The idea of her father marrying again had never\npresented itself to her before. She did not like it and she lay silent\nunder the chill of it.\n\n\"Stepmothers are AWFUL creatures,\" Mary went on. \"I could make your\nblood run cold if I was to tell you all I know about 'em. The Wilson\nkids across the road from Wiley's had a stepmother. She was just as bad\nto 'em as Mrs. Wiley was to me. It'll be awful if you get a stepmother.\"\n\n\"I'm sure we won't,\" said Una tremulously. \"Father won't marry anybody\nelse.\"\n\n\"He'll be hounded into it, I expect,\" said Mary darkly. \"All the old\nmaids in the settlement are after him. There's no being up to them. And\nthe worst of stepmothers is, they always set your father against you.\nHe'd never care anything about you again. He'd always take her part and\nher children's part. You see, she'd make him believe you were all bad.\"\n\n\"I wish you hadn't told me this, Mary,\" cried Una. \"It makes me feel so\nunhappy.\"\n\n\"I only wanted to warn you,\" said Mary, rather repentantly. \"Of course,\nyour father's so absent-minded he mightn't happen to think of getting\nmarried again. But it's better to be prepared.\"\n\nLong after Mary slept serenely little Una lay awake, her eyes smarting\nwith tears. On, how dreadful it would be if her father should marry\nsomebody who would make him hate her and Jerry and Faith and Carl! She\ncouldn't bear it--she couldn't!\n\nMary had not instilled any poison of the kind Miss Cornelia had feared\ninto the manse children's minds. Yet she had certainly contrived to do a\nlittle mischief with the best of intentions. But she slept dreamlessly,\nwhile Una lay awake and the rain fell and the wind wailed around the\nold gray manse. And the Rev. John Meredith forgot to go to bed at all\nbecause he was absorbed in reading a life of St. Augustine. It was gray\ndawn when he finished it and went upstairs, wrestling with the problems\nof two thousand years ago. The door of the girls' room was open and he\nsaw Faith lying asleep, rosy and beautiful. He wondered where Una was.\nPerhaps she had gone over to \"stay all night\" with the Blythe girls. She\ndid this occasionally, deeming it a great treat. John Meredith sighed.\nHe felt that Una's whereabouts ought not to be a mystery to him. Cecelia\nwould have looked after her better than that.\n\nIf only Cecelia were still with him! How pretty and gay she had been!\nHow the old manse up at Maywater had echoed to her songs! And she\nhad gone away so suddenly, taking her laughter and music and leaving\nsilence--so suddenly that he had never quite got over his feeling of\namazement. How could SHE, the beautiful and vivid, have died?\n\nThe idea of a second marriage had never presented itself seriously to\nJohn Meredith. He had loved his wife so deeply that he believed he could\nnever care for any woman again. He had a vague idea that before very\nlong Faith would be old enough to take her mother's place. Until then,\nhe must do the best he could alone. He sighed and went to his room,\nwhere the bed was still unmade. Aunt Martha had forgotten it, and Mary\nhad not dared to make it because Aunt Martha had forbidden her to meddle\nwith anything in the minister's room. But Mr. Meredith did not notice\nthat it was unmade. His last thoughts were of St. Augustine.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. THE MANSE GIRLS CLEAN HOUSE\n\n\"Ugh,\" said Faith, sitting up in bed with a shiver. \"It's raining. I do\nhate a rainy Sunday. Sunday is dull enough even when it's fine.\"\n\n\"We oughtn't to find Sunday dull,\" said Una sleepily, trying to pull her\ndrowsy wits together with an uneasy conviction that they had overslept.\n\n\"But we DO, you know,\" said Faith candidly. \"Mary Vance says most\nSundays are so dull she could hang herself.\"\n\n\"We ought to like Sunday better than Mary Vance,\" said Una remorsefully.\n\"We're the minister's children.\"\n\n\"I wish we were a blacksmith's children,\" protested Faith angrily,\nhunting for her stockings. \"THEN people wouldn't expect us to be better\nthan other children. JUST look at the holes in my heels. Mary darned\nthem all up before she went away, but they're as bad as ever now. Una,\nget up. I can't get the breakfast alone. Oh, dear. I wish father and\nJerry were home. You wouldn't think we'd miss father much--we don't see\nmuch of him when he is home. And yet EVERYTHING seems gone. I must run\nin and see how Aunt Martha is.\"\n\n\"Is she any better?\" asked Una, when Faith returned.\n\n\"No, she isn't. She's groaning with the misery still. Maybe we ought to\ntell Dr. Blythe. But she says not--she never had a doctor in her\nlife and she isn't going to begin now. She says doctors just live by\npoisoning people. Do you suppose they do?\"\n\n\"No, of course not,\" said Una indignantly. \"I'm sure Dr. Blythe wouldn't\npoison anybody.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll have to rub Aunt Martha's back again after breakfast. We'd\nbetter not make the flannels as hot as we did yesterday.\"\n\nFaith giggled over the remembrance. They had nearly scalded the skin off\npoor Aunt Martha's back. Una sighed. Mary Vance would have known just\nwhat the precise temperature of flannels for a misery back should be.\nMary knew everything. They knew nothing. And how could they learn,\nsave by bitter experience for which, in this instance, unfortunate Aunt\nMartha had paid?\n\nThe preceding Monday Mr. Meredith had left for Nova Scotia to spend\nhis short vacation, taking Jerry with him. On Wednesday Aunt Martha was\nsuddenly seized with a recurring and mysterious ailment which she always\ncalled \"the misery,\" and which was tolerably certain to attack her\nat the most inconvenient times. She could not rise from her bed, any\nmovement causing agony. A doctor she flatly refused to have. Faith and\nUna cooked the meals and waited on her. The less said about the meals\nthe better--yet they were not much worse than Aunt Martha's had been.\nThere were many women in the village who would have been glad to come\nand help, but Aunt Martha refused to let her plight be known.\n\n\"You must worry on till I kin git around,\" she groaned. \"Thank goodness,\nJohn isn't here. There's a plenty o' cold biled meat and bread and you\nkin try your hand at making porridge.\"\n\nThe girls had tried their hand, but so far without much success. The\nfirst day it had been too thin. The next day so thick that you could cut\nit in slices. And both days it had been burned.\n\n\"I hate porridge,\" said Faith viciously. \"When I have a house of my own\nI'm NEVER going to have a single bit of porridge in it.\"\n\n\"What'll your children do then?\" asked Una. \"Children have to have\nporridge or they won't grow. Everybody says so.\"\n\n\"They'll have to get along without it or stay runts,\" retorted Faith\nstubbornly. \"Here, Una, you stir it while I set the table. If I leave it\nfor a minute the horrid stuff will burn. It's half past nine. We'll be\nlate for Sunday School.\"\n\n\"I haven't seen anyone going past yet,\" said Una. \"There won't likely be\nmany out. Just see how it's pouring. And when there's no preaching the\nfolks won't come from a distance to bring the children.\"\n\n\"Go and call Carl,\" said Faith.\n\nCarl, it appeared, had a sore throat, induced by getting wet in the\nRainbow Valley marsh the previous evening while pursuing dragon-flies.\nHe had come home with dripping stockings and boots and had sat out the\nevening in them. He could not eat any breakfast and Faith made him go\nback to bed again. She and Una left the table as it was and went to\nSunday School. There was no one in the school room when they got there\nand no one came. They waited until eleven and then went home.\n\n\"There doesn't seem to be anybody at the Methodist Sunday School\neither,\" said Una.\n\n\"I'm GLAD,\" said Faith. \"I'd hate to think the Methodists were better\nat going to Sunday School on rainy Sundays than the Presbyterians. But\nthere's no preaching in their Church to-day, either, so likely their\nSunday School is in the afternoon.\"\n\nUna washed the dishes, doing them quite nicely, for so much had she\nlearned from Mary Vance. Faith swept the floor after a fashion and\npeeled the potatoes for dinner, cutting her finger in the process.\n\n\"I wish we had something for dinner besides ditto,\" sighed Una. \"I'm so\ntired of it. The Blythe children don't know what ditto is. And we NEVER\nhave any pudding. Nan says Susan would faint if they had no pudding on\nSundays. Why aren't we like other people, Faith?\"\n\n\"I don't want to be like other people,\" laughed Faith, tying up her\nbleeding finger. \"I like being myself. It's more interesting. Jessie\nDrew is as good a housekeeper as her mother, but would you want to be as\nstupid as she is?\"\n\n\"But our house isn't right. Mary Vance says so. She says people talk\nabout it being so untidy.\"\n\nFaith had an inspiration.\n\n\"We'll clean it all up,\" she cried. \"We'll go right to work to-morrow.\nIt's a real good chance when Aunt Martha is laid up and can't interfere\nwith us. We'll have it all lovely and clean when father comes home, just\nlike it was when Mary went away. ANY ONE can sweep and dust and wash\nwindows. People won't be able to talk about us any more. Jem Blythe\nsays it's only old cats that talk, but their talk hurts just as much as\nanybody's.\"\n\n\"I hope it will be fine to-morrow,\" said Una, fired with enthusiasm.\n\"Oh, Faith, it will be splendid to be all cleaned up and like other\npeople.\"\n\n\"I hope Aunt Martha's misery will last over to-morrow,\" said Faith. \"If\nit doesn't we won't get a single thing done.\"\n\nFaith's amiable wish was fulfilled. The next day found Aunt Martha still\nunable to rise. Carl, too, was still sick and easily prevailed on to\nstay in bed. Neither Faith nor Una had any idea how sick the boy really\nwas; a watchful mother would have had a doctor without delay; but there\nwas no mother, and poor little Carl, with his sore throat and aching\nhead and crimson cheeks, rolled himself up in his twisted bedclothes and\nsuffered alone, somewhat comforted by the companionship of a small green\nlizard in the pocket of his ragged nighty.\n\nThe world was full of summer sunshine after the rain. It was a peerless\nday for house-cleaning and Faith and Una went gaily to work.\n\n\"We'll clean the dining-room and the parlour,\" said Faith. \"It wouldn't\ndo to meddle with the study, and it doesn't matter much about the\nupstairs. The first thing is to take everything out.\"\n\nAccordingly, everything was taken out. The furniture was piled on the\nveranda and lawn and the Methodist graveyard fence was gaily draped with\nrugs. An orgy of sweeping followed, with an attempt at dusting on Una's\npart, while Faith washed the windows of the dining-room, breaking one\npane and cracking two in the process. Una surveyed the streaked result\ndubiously.\n\n\"They don't look right, somehow,\" she said. \"Mrs. Elliott's and Susan's\nwindows just shine and sparkle.\"\n\n\"Never mind. They let the sunshine through just as well,\" said Faith\ncheerfully. \"They MUST be clean after all the soap and water I've used,\nand that's the main thing. Now, it's past eleven, so I'll wipe up this\nmess on the floor and we'll go outside. You dust the furniture and I'll\nshake the rugs. I'm going to do it in the graveyard. I don't want to\nsend dust flying all over the lawn.\"\n\nFaith enjoyed the rug shaking. To stand on Hezekiah Pollock's tombstone,\nflapping and shaking rugs, was real fun. To be sure, Elder Abraham\nClow and his wife, driving past in their capacious double-seated buggy,\nseemed to gaze at her in grim disapproval.\n\n\"Isn't that a terrible sight?\" said Elder Abraham solemnly.\n\n\"I would never have believed it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,\"\nsaid Mrs. Elder Abraham, more solemnly still.\n\nFaith waved a door mat cheerily at the Clow party. It did not worry her\nthat the elder and his wife did not return her greeting. Everybody\nknew that Elder Abraham had never been known to smile since he had been\nappointed Superintendent of the Sunday School fourteen years previously.\nBut it hurt her that Minnie and Adella Clow did not wave back. Faith\nliked Minnie and Adella. Next to the Blythes, they were her best friends\nin school and she always helped Adella with her sums. This was gratitude\nfor you. Her friends cut her because she was shaking rugs in an old\ngraveyard where, as Mary Vance said, not a living soul had been buried\nfor years. Faith flounced around to the veranda, where she found Una\ngrieved in spirit because the Clow girls had not waved to her, either.\n\n\"I suppose they're mad over something,\" said Faith. \"Perhaps they're\njealous because we play so much in Rainbow Valley with the Blythes.\nWell, just wait till school opens and Adella wants me to show her how to\ndo her sums! We'll get square then. Come on, let's put the things back\nin. I'm tired to death and I don't believe the rooms will look much\nbetter than before we started--though I shook out pecks of dust in the\ngraveyard. I HATE house-cleaning.\"\n\nIt was two o'clock before the tired girls finished the two rooms. They\ngot a dreary bite in the kitchen and intended to wash the dishes at\nonce. But Faith happened to pick up a new story-book Di Blythe had lent\nher and was lost to the world until sunset. Una took a cup of rank tea\nup to Carl but found him asleep; so she curled herself up on Jerry's bed\nand went to sleep too. Meanwhile, a weird story flew through Glen St.\nMary and folks asked each other seriously what was to be done with those\nmanse youngsters.\n\n\"That is past laughing at, believe ME,\" said Miss Cornelia to her\nhusband, with a heavy sigh. \"I couldn't believe it at first. Miranda\nDrew brought the story home from the Methodist Sunday School this\nafternoon and I simply scoffed at it. But Mrs. Elder Abraham says she\nand the Elder saw it with their own eyes.\"\n\n\"Saw what?\" asked Marshall.\n\n\"Faith and Una Meredith stayed home from Sunday School this morning and\nCLEANED HOUSE,\" said Miss Cornelia, in accents of despair. \"When Elder\nAbraham went home from the church--he had stayed behind to straighten\nout the library books--he saw them shaking rugs in the Methodist\ngraveyard. I can never look a Methodist in the face again. Just think\nwhat a scandal it will make!\"\n\nA scandal it assuredly did make, growing more scandalous as it spread,\nuntil the over-harbour people heard that the manse children had not only\ncleaned house and put out a washing on Sunday, but had wound up with an\nafternoon picnic in the graveyard while the Methodist Sunday School was\ngoing on. The only household which remained in blissful ignorance of\nthe terrible thing was the manse itself; on what Faith and Una fondly\nbelieved to be Tuesday it rained again; for the next three days it\nrained; nobody came near the manse; the manse folk went nowhere; they\nmight have waded through the misty Rainbow Valley up to Ingleside, but\nall the Blythe family, save Susan and the doctor, were away on a visit\nto Avonlea.\n\n\"This is the last of our bread,\" said Faith, \"and the ditto is done. If\nAunt Martha doesn't get better soon WHAT will we do?\"\n\n\"We can buy some bread in the village and there's the codfish Mary\ndried,\" said Una. \"But we don't know how to cook it.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's easy,\" laughed Faith. \"You just boil it.\"\n\nBoil it they did; but as it did not occur to them to soak it beforehand\nit was too salty to eat. That night they were very hungry; but by the\nfollowing day their troubles were over. Sunshine returned to the world;\nCarl was well and Aunt Martha's misery left her as suddenly as it had\ncome; the butcher called at the manse and chased famine away. To crown\nall, the Blythes returned home, and that evening they and the manse\nchildren and Mary Vance kept sunset tryst once more in Rainbow Valley,\nwhere the daisies were floating upon the grass like spirits of the dew\nand the bells on the Tree Lovers rang like fairy chimes in the scented\ntwilight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. A DREADFUL DISCOVERY\n\n\"Well, you kids have gone and done it now,\" was Mary's greeting, as she\njoined them in the Valley. Miss Cornelia was up at Ingleside, holding\nagonized conclave with Anne and Susan, and Mary hoped that the session\nmight be a long one, for it was all of two weeks since she had been\nallowed to revel with her chums in the dear valley of rainbows.\n\n\"Done what?\" demanded everybody but Walter, who was day-dreaming as\nusual.\n\n\"It's you manse young ones, I mean,\" said Mary. \"It was just awful of\nyou. _I_ wouldn't have done such a thing for the world, and _I_ weren't\nbrought up in a manse--weren't brought up ANYWHERE--just COME up.\"\n\n\"What have WE done?\" asked Faith blankly.\n\n\"Done! You'd BETTER ask! The talk is something terrible. I expect it's\nruined your father in this congregation. He'll never be able to live it\ndown, poor man! Everybody blames him for it, and that isn't fair. But\nnothing IS fair in this world. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.\"\n\n\"What HAVE we done?\" asked Una again, despairingly. Faith said nothing,\nbut her eyes flashed golden-brown scorn at Mary.\n\n\"Oh, don't pretend innocence,\" said Mary, witheringly. \"Everybody knows\nwhat you have done.\"\n\n\"_I_ don't,\" interjected Jem Blythe indignantly. \"Don't let me catch you\nmaking Una cry, Mary Vance. What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"I s'pose you don't know, since you're just back from up west,\" said\nMary, somewhat subdued. Jem could always manage her. \"But everybody else\nknows, you'd better believe.\"\n\n\"Knows what?\"\n\n\"That Faith and Una stayed home from Sunday School last Sunday and\nCLEANED HOUSE.\"\n\n\"We didn't,\" cried Faith and Una, in passionate denial.\n\nMary looked haughtily at them.\n\n\"I didn't suppose you'd deny it, after the way you've combed ME down for\nlying,\" she said. \"What's the good of saying you didn't? Everybody knows\nyou DID. Elder Clow and his wife saw you. Some people say it will break\nup the church, but _I_ don't go that far. You ARE nice ones.\"\n\nNan Blythe stood up and put her arms around the dazed Faith and Una.\n\n\"They were nice enough to take you in and feed you and clothe you when\nyou were starving in Mr. Taylor's barn, Mary Vance,\" she said. \"You are\nVERY grateful, I must say.\"\n\n\"I AM grateful,\" retorted Mary. \"You'd know it if you'd heard me\nstanding up for Mr. Meredith through thick and thin. I've blistered\nmy tongue talking for him this week. I've said again and again that\nhe isn't to blame if his young ones did clean house on Sunday. He was\naway--and they knew better.\"\n\n\"But we didn't,\" protested Una. \"It was MONDAY we cleaned house. Wasn't\nit, Faith?\"\n\n\"Of course it was,\" said Faith, with flashing eyes. \"We went to Sunday\nSchool in spite of the rain--and no one came--not even Elder Abraham,\nfor all his talk about fair-weather Christians.\"\n\n\"It was Saturday it rained,\" said Mary. \"Sunday was as fine as silk. I\nwasn't at Sunday School because I had toothache, but every one else was\nand they saw all your stuff out on the lawn. And Elder Abraham and Mrs.\nElder Abraham saw you shaking rugs in the graveyard.\"\n\nUna sat down among the daisies and began to cry.\n\n\"Look here,\" said Jem resolutely, \"this thing must be cleared up.\nSOMEBODY has made a mistake. Sunday WAS fine, Faith. How could you have\nthought Saturday was Sunday?\"\n\n\"Prayer-meeting was Thursday night,\" cried Faith, \"and Adam flew into\nthe soup-pot on Friday when Aunt Martha's cat chased him, and spoiled\nour dinner; and Saturday there was a snake in the cellar and Carl caught\nit with a forked stick and carried it out, and Sunday it rained. So\nthere!\"\n\n\"Prayer-meeting was Wednesday night,\" said Mary. \"Elder Baxter was to\nlead and he couldn't go Thursday night and it was changed to Wednesday.\nYou were just a day out, Faith Meredith, and you DID work on Sunday.\"\n\nSuddenly Faith burst into a peal of laughter.\n\n\"I suppose we did. What a joke!\"\n\n\"It isn't much of a joke for your father,\" said Mary sourly.\n\n\"It'll be all right when people find out it was just a mistake,\" said\nFaith carelessly. \"We'll explain.\"\n\n\"You can explain till you're black in the face,\" said Mary, \"but a lie\nlike that'll travel faster'n further than you ever will. I'VE seen more\nof the world than you and _I_ know. Besides, there are plenty of folks\nwon't believe it was a mistake.\"\n\n\"They will if I tell them,\" said Faith.\n\n\"You can't tell everybody,\" said Mary. \"No, I tell you you've disgraced\nyour father.\"\n\nUna's evening was spoiled by this dire reflection, but Faith refused to\nbe made uncomfortable. Besides, she had a plan that would put everything\nright. So she put the past with its mistake behind her and gave herself\nover to enjoyment of the present. Jem went away to fish and Walter came\nout of his reverie and proceeded to describe the woods of heaven. Mary\npricked up her ears and listened respectfully. Despite her awe of\nWalter she revelled in his \"book talk.\" It always gave her a delightful\nsensation. Walter had been reading his Coleridge that day, and he\npictured a heaven where\n\n    \"There were gardens bright with sinuous rills\n        Where blossomed many an incense bearing tree,\n    And there were forests ancient as the hills\n        Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.\"\n\n\"I didn't know there was any woods in heaven,\" said Mary, with a long\nbreath. \"I thought it was all streets--and streets--AND streets.\"\n\n\"Of course there are woods,\" said Nan. \"Mother can't live without\ntrees and I can't, so what would be the use of going to heaven if there\nweren't any trees?\"\n\n\"There are cities, too,\" said the young dreamer, \"splendid\ncities--coloured just like the sunset, with sapphire towers and rainbow\ndomes. They are built of gold and diamonds--whole streets of diamonds,\nflashing like the sun. In the squares there are crystal fountains kissed\nby the light, and everywhere the asphodel blooms--the flower of heaven.\"\n\n\"Fancy!\" said Mary. \"I saw the main street in Charlottetown once and I\nthought it was real grand, but I s'pose it's nothing to heaven. Well, it\nall sounds gorgeous the way you tell it, but won't it be kind of dull,\ntoo?\"\n\n\"Oh, I guess we can have some fun when the angels' backs are turned,\"\nsaid Faith comfortably.\n\n\"Heaven is ALL fun,\" declared Di.\n\n\"The Bible doesn't say so,\" cried Mary, who had read so much of the\nBible on Sunday afternoons under Miss Cornelia's eye that she now\nconsidered herself quite an authority on it.\n\n\"Mother says the Bible language is figurative,\" said Nan.\n\n\"Does that mean that it isn't true?\" asked Mary hopefully.\n\n\"No--not exactly--but I think it means that heaven will be just like\nwhat you'd like it to be.\"\n\n\"I'd like it to be just like Rainbow Valley,\" said Mary, \"with all you\nkids to gas and play with. THAT'S good enough for me. Anyhow, we can't\ngo to heaven till we're dead and maybe not then, so what's the use of\nworrying? Here's Jem with a string of trout and it's my turn to fry\nthem.\"\n\n\"We ought to know more about heaven than Walter does when we're the\nminister's family,\" said Una, as they walked home that night.\n\n\"We KNOW just as much, but Walter can IMAGINE,\" said Faith. \"Mrs.\nElliott says he gets it from his mother.\"\n\n\"I do wish we hadn't made that mistake about Sunday,\" sighed Una.\n\n\"Don't worry over that. I've thought of a great plan to explain so that\neverybody will know,\" said Faith. \"Just wait till to-morrow night.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. AN EXPLANATION AND A DARE\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Cooper preached in Glen St. Mary the next evening and\nthe Presbyterian Church was crowded with people from near and far. The\nReverend Doctor was reputed to be a very eloquent speaker; and, bearing\nin mind the old dictum that a minister should take his best clothes\nto the city and his best sermons to the country, he delivered a very\nscholarly and impressive discourse. But when the folks went home that\nnight it was not of Dr. Cooper's sermon they talked. They had completely\nforgotten all about it.\n\nDr. Cooper had concluded with a fervent appeal, had wiped the\nperspiration from his massive brow, had said \"Let us pray\" as he was\nfamed for saying it, and had duly prayed. There was a slight pause. In\nGlen St. Mary church the old fashion of taking the collection after the\nsermon instead of before still held--mainly because the Methodists had\nadopted the new fashion first, and Miss Cornelia and Elder Clow would\nnot hear of following where Methodists had led. Charles Baxter and\nThomas Douglas, whose duty it was to pass the plates, were on the point\nof rising to their feet. The organist had got out the music of her\nanthem and the choir had cleared its throat. Suddenly Faith Meredith\nrose in the manse pew, walked up to the pulpit platform, and faced the\namazed audience.\n\nMiss Cornelia half rose in her seat and then sat down again. Her pew was\nfar back and it occurred to her that whatever Faith meant to do or say\nwould be half done or said before she could reach her. There was no use\nmaking the exhibition worse than it had to be. With an anguished glance\nat Mrs. Dr. Blythe, and another at Deacon Warren of the Methodist\nChurch, Miss Cornelia resigned herself to another scandal.\n\n\"If the child was only dressed decently itself,\" she groaned in spirit.\n\nFaith, having spilled ink on her good dress, had serenely put on an\nold one of faded pink print. A caticornered rent in the skirt had\nbeen darned with scarlet tracing cotton and the hem had been let down,\nshowing a bright strip of unfaded pink around the skirt. But Faith was\nnot thinking of her clothes at all. She was feeling suddenly nervous.\nWhat had seemed easy in imagination was rather hard in reality.\nConfronted by all those staring questioning eyes Faith's courage almost\nfailed her. The lights were so bright, the silence so awesome. She\nthought she could not speak after all. But she MUST--her father MUST be\ncleared of suspicion. Only--the words would NOT come.\n\nUna's little pearl-pure face gleamed up at her beseechingly from the\nmanse pew. The Blythe children were lost in amazement. Back under the\ngallery Faith saw the sweet graciousness of Miss Rosemary West's smile\nand the amusement of Miss Ellen's. But none of these helped her. It was\nBertie Shakespeare Drew who saved the situation. Bertie Shakespeare sat\nin the front seat of the gallery and he made a derisive face at Faith.\nFaith promptly made a dreadful one back at him, and, in her anger over\nbeing grimaced at by Bertie Shakespeare, forgot her stage fright. She\nfound her voice and spoke out clearly and bravely.\n\n\"I want to explain something,\" she said, \"and I want to do it now\nbecause everybody will hear it that heard the other. People are saying\nthat Una and I stayed home last Sunday and cleaned house instead of\ngoing to Sunday School. Well, we did--but we didn't mean to. We\ngot mixed up in the days of the week. It was all Elder Baxter's\nfault\"--sensation in Baxter's pew--\"because he went and changed the\nprayer-meeting to Wednesday night and then we thought Thursday was\nFriday and so on till we thought Saturday was Sunday. Carl was laid up\nsick and so was Aunt Martha, so they couldn't put us right. We went to\nSunday School in all that rain on Saturday and nobody came. And then we\nthought we'd clean house on Monday and stop old cats from talking about\nhow dirty the manse was\"--general sensation all over the church--\"and we\ndid. I shook the rugs in the Methodist graveyard because it was such\na convenient place and not because I meant to be disrespectful of the\ndead. It isn't the dead folks who have made the fuss over this--it's the\nliving folks. And it isn't right for any of you to blame my father for\nthis, because he was away and didn't know, and anyhow we thought it was\nMonday. He's just the best father that ever lived in the world and we\nlove him with all our hearts.\"\n\nFaith's bravado ebbed out in a sob. She ran down the steps and flashed\nout of the side door of the church. There the friendly starlit, summer\nnight comforted her and the ache went out of her eyes and throat. She\nfelt very happy. The dreadful explanation was over and everybody knew\nnow that her father wasn't to blame and that she and Una were not so\nwicked as to have cleaned house knowingly on Sunday.\n\nInside the church people gazed blankly at each other, but Thomas Douglas\nrose and walked up the aisle with a set face. HIS duty was clear; the\ncollection must be taken if the skies fell. Taken it was; the choir sang\nthe anthem, with a dismal conviction that it fell terribly flat, and Dr.\nCooper gave out the concluding hymn and pronounced the benediction with\nconsiderably less unction than usual. The Reverend Doctor had a sense of\nhumour and Faith's performance tickled him. Besides, John Meredith was\nwell known in Presbyterian circles.\n\nMr. Meredith returned home the next afternoon, but before his coming\nFaith contrived to scandalize Glen St. Mary again. In the reaction from\nSunday evening's intensity and strain she was especially full of what\nMiss Cornelia would have called \"devilment\" on Monday. This led her to\ndare Walter Blythe to ride through Main Street on a pig, while she rode\nanother one.\n\nThe pigs in question were two tall, lank animals, supposed to belong to\nBertie Shakespeare Drew's father, which had been haunting the roadside\nby the manse for a couple of weeks. Walter did not want to ride a pig\nthrough Glen St. Mary, but whatever Faith Meredith dared him to do must\nbe done. They tore down the hill and through the village, Faith bent\ndouble with laughter over her terrified courser, Walter crimson with\nshame. They tore past the minister himself, just coming home from the\nstation; he, being a little less dreamy and abstracted than usual--owing\nto having had a talk on the train with Miss Cornelia who always wakened\nhim up temporarily--noticed them, and thought he really must speak to\nFaith about it and tell her that such conduct was not seemly. But he had\nforgotten the trifling incident by the time he reached home. They passed\nMrs. Alec Davis, who shrieked in horror, and they passed Miss Rosemary\nWest who laughed and sighed. Finally, just before the pigs swooped into\nBertie Shakespeare Drew's back yard, never to emerge therefrom again, so\ngreat had been the shock to their nerves--Faith and Walter jumped off,\nas Dr. and Mrs. Blythe drove swiftly by.\n\n\"So that is how you bring up your boys,\" said Gilbert with mock\nseverity.\n\n\"Perhaps I do spoil them a little,\" said Anne contritely, \"but, oh,\nGilbert, when I think of my own childhood before I came to Green Gables\nI haven't the heart to be very strict. How hungry for love and fun I\nwas--an unloved little drudge with never a chance to play! They do have\nsuch good times with the manse children.\"\n\n\"What about the poor pigs?\" asked Gilbert.\n\nAnne tried to look sober and failed.\n\n\"Do you really think it hurt them?\" she said. \"I don't think anything\ncould hurt those animals. They've been the plague of the neighbourhood\nthis summer and the Drews WON'T shut them up. But I'll talk to\nWalter--if I can keep from laughing when I do it.\"\n\nMiss Cornelia came up to Ingleside that evening to relieve her feelings\nover Sunday night. To her surprise she found that Anne did not view\nFaith's performance in quite the same light as she did.\n\n\"I thought there was something brave and pathetic in her getting up\nthere before that churchful of people, to confess,\" she said. \"You could\nsee she was frightened to death--yet she was bound to clear her father.\nI loved her for it.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course, the poor child meant well,\" sighed Miss Cornelia, \"but\njust the same it was a terrible thing to do, and is making more talk\nthan the house-cleaning on Sunday. THAT had begun to die away, and this\nhas started it all up again. Rosemary West is like you--she said last\nnight as she left the church that it was a plucky thing for Faith to do,\nbut it made her feel sorry for the child, too. Miss Ellen thought it all\na good joke, and said she hadn't had as much fun in church for years.\nOf course THEY don't care--they are Episcopalians. But we Presbyterians\nfeel it. And there were so many hotel people there that night and scores\nof Methodists. Mrs. Leander Crawford cried, she felt so bad. And Mrs.\nAlec Davis said the little hussy ought to be spanked.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Leander Crawford is always crying in church,\" said Susan\ncontemptuously. \"She cries over every affecting thing the minister says.\nBut you do not often see her name on a subscription list, Mrs. Dr. dear.\nTears come cheaper. She tried to talk to me one day about Aunt Martha\nbeing such a dirty housekeeper; and I wanted to say, 'Every one knows\nthat YOU have been seen mixing up cakes in the kitchen wash-pan, Mrs.\nLeander Crawford!' But I did not say it, Mrs. Dr. dear, because I have\ntoo much respect for myself to condescend to argue with the likes of\nher. But I could tell worse things than THAT of Mrs. Leander Crawford,\nif I was disposed to gossip. And as for Mrs. Alec Davis, if she had said\nthat to me, Mrs. Dr. dear, do you know what I would have said? I would\nhave said, 'I have no doubt you would like to spank Faith, Mrs. Davis,\nbut you will never have the chance to spank a minister's daughter either\nin this world or in that which is to come.'\"\n\n\"If poor Faith had only been decently dressed,\" lamented Miss Cornelia\nagain, \"it wouldn't have been quite that bad. But that dress looked\ndreadful, as she stood there upon the platform.\"\n\n\"It was clean, though, Mrs. Dr. dear,\" said Susan. \"They ARE clean\nchildren. They may be very heedless and reckless, Mrs. Dr. dear, and I\nam not saying they are not, but they NEVER forget to wash behind their\nears.\"\n\n\"The idea of Faith forgetting what day was Sunday,\" persisted Miss\nCornelia. \"She will grow up just as careless and impractical as her\nfather, believe ME. I suppose Carl would have known better if he hadn't\nbeen sick. I don't know what was wrong with him, but I think it very\nlikely he had been eating those blueberries that grew in the graveyard.\nNo wonder they made him sick. If I was a Methodist I'd try to keep my\ngraveyard cleaned up at least.\"\n\n\"I am of the opinion that Carl only ate the sours that grow on the\ndyke,\" said Susan hopefully. \"I do not think ANY minister's son would\neat blueberries that grew on the graves of dead people. You know it\nwould not be so bad, Mrs. Dr. dear, to eat things that grew on the\ndyke.\"\n\n\"The worst of last night's performance was the face Faith made made at\nsomebody in the congregation before she started in,\" said Miss Cornelia.\n\"Elder Clow declares she made it at him. And DID you hear that she was\nseen riding on a pig to-day?\"\n\n\"I saw her. Walter was with her. I gave him a little--a VERY\nlittle--scolding about it. He did not say much, but he gave me the\nimpression that it had been his idea and that Faith was not to blame.\"\n\n\"I do not not believe THAT, Mrs. Dr. dear,\" cried Susan, up in arms.\n\"That is just Walter's way--to take the blame on himself. But you know\nas well as I do, Mrs. Dr. dear, that that blessed child would never have\nthought of riding on a pig, even if he does write poetry.\"\n\n\"Oh, there's no doubt the notion was hatched in Faith Meredith's brain,\"\nsaid Miss Cornelia. \"And I don't say that I'm sorry that Amos Drew's old\npigs did get their come-uppance for once. But the minister's daughter!\"\n\n\"AND the doctor's son!\" said Anne, mimicking Miss Cornelia's tone. Then\nshe laughed. \"Dear Miss Cornelia, they're only little children. And\nyou KNOW they've never yet done anything bad--they're just heedless and\nimpulsive--as I was myself once. They'll grow sedate and sober--as I've\ndone.\"\n\nMiss Cornelia laughed, too.\n\n\"There are times, Anne dearie, when I know by your eyes that YOUR\nsoberness is put on like a garment and you're really aching to do\nsomething wild and young again. Well, I feel encouraged. Somehow, a\ntalk with you always does have that effect on me. Now, when I go to\nsee Barbara Samson, it's just the opposite. She makes me feel that\neverything's wrong and always will be. But of course living all your\nlife with a man like Joe Samson wouldn't be exactly cheering.\"\n\n\"It is a very strange thing to think that she married Joe Samson after\nall her chances,\" remarked Susan. \"She was much sought after when she\nwas a girl. She used to boast to me that she had twenty-one beaus and\nMr. Pethick.\"\n\n\"What was Mr. Pethick?\"\n\n\"Well, he was a sort of hanger-on, Mrs. Dr. dear, but you could\nnot exactly call him a beau. He did not really have any intentions.\nTwenty-one beaus--and me that never had one! But Barbara went through\nthe woods and picked up the crooked stick after all. And yet they say\nher husband can make better baking powder biscuits than she can, and she\nalways gets him to make them when company comes to tea.\"\n\n\"Which reminds ME that I have company coming to tea to-morrow and I must\ngo home and set my bread,\" said Miss Cornelia. \"Mary said she could set\nit and no doubt she could. But while I live and move and have my being\n_I_ set my own bread, believe me.\"\n\n\"How is Mary getting on?\" asked Anne.\n\n\"I've no fault to find with Mary,\" said Miss Cornelia rather\ngloomily. \"She's getting some flesh on her bones and she's clean and\nrespectful--though there's more in her than _I_ can fathom. She's a sly\npuss. If you dug for a thousand years you couldn't get to the bottom of\nthat child's mind, believe ME! As for work, I never saw anything like\nher. She EATS it up. Mrs. Wiley may have been cruel to her, but folks\nneedn't say she made Mary work. Mary's a born worker. Sometimes I wonder\nwhich will wear out first--her legs or her tongue. I don't have enough\nto do to keep me out of mischief these days. I'll be real glad when\nschool opens, for then I'll have something to do again. Mary doesn't\nwant to go to school, but I put my foot down and said that go she must.\nI shall NOT have the Methodists saying that I kept her out of school\nwhile I lolled in idleness.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. THE HOUSE ON THE HILL\n\nThere was a little unfailing spring, always icy cold and crystal pure,\nin a certain birch-screened hollow of Rainbow Valley in the lower corner\nnear the marsh. Not a great many people knew of its existence. The manse\nand Ingleside children knew, of course, as they knew everything else\nabout the magic valley. Occasionally they went there to get a drink,\nand it figured in many of their plays as a fountain of old romance. Anne\nknew of it and loved it because it somehow reminded her of the beloved\nDryad's Bubble at Green Gables. Rosemary West knew of it; it was her\nfountain of romance, too. Eighteen years ago she had sat behind it one\nspring twilight and heard young Martin Crawford stammer out a confession\nof fervent, boyish love. She had whispered her own secret in return,\nand they had kissed and promised by the wild wood spring. They had never\nstood together by it again--Martin had sailed on his fatal voyage soon\nafter; but to Rosemary West it was always a sacred spot, hallowed by\nthat immortal hour of youth and love. Whenever she passed near it she\nturned aside to hold a secret tryst with an old dream--a dream from\nwhich the pain had long gone, leaving only its unforgettable sweetness.\n\nThe spring was a hidden thing. You might have passed within ten feet of\nit and never have suspected its existence. Two generations past a huge\nold pine had fallen almost across it. Nothing was left of the tree but\nits crumbling trunk out of which the ferns grew thickly, making a green\nroof and a lacy screen for the water. A maple-tree grew beside it with\na curiously gnarled and twisted trunk, creeping along the ground for\na little way before shooting up into the air, and so forming a quaint\nseat; and September had flung a scarf of pale smoke-blue asters around\nthe hollow.\n\nJohn Meredith, taking the cross-lots road through Rainbow Valley on\nhis way home from some pastoral visitations around the Harbour head one\nevening, turned aside to drink of the little spring. Walter Blythe had\nshown it to him one afternoon only a few days before, and they had had\na long talk together on the maple seat. John Meredith, under all his\nshyness and aloofness, had the heart of a boy. He had been called Jack\nin his youth, though nobody in Glen St. Mary would ever have believed\nit. Walter and he had taken to each other and had talked unreservedly.\nMr. Meredith found his way into some sealed and sacred chambers of the\nlad's soul wherein not even Di had ever looked. They were to be\nchums from that friendly hour and Walter knew that he would never be\nfrightened of the minister again.\n\n\"I never believed before that it was possible to get really acquainted\nwith a minister,\" he told his mother that night.\n\nJohn Meredith drank from his slender white hand, whose grip of steel\nalways surprised people who were unacquainted with it, and then sat down\non the maple seat. He was in no hurry to go home; this was a beautiful\nspot and he was mentally weary after a round of rather uninspiring\nconversations with many good and stupid people. The moon was rising.\nRainbow Valley was wind-haunted and star-sentinelled only where he was,\nbut afar from the upper end came the gay notes of children's laughter\nand voices.\n\nThe ethereal beauty of the asters in the moonlight, the glimmer of the\nlittle spring, the soft croon of the brook, the wavering grace of\nthe brackens all wove a white magic round John Meredith. He forgot\ncongregational worries and spiritual problems; the years slipped away\nfrom him; he was a young divinity student again and the roses of June\nwere blooming red and fragrant on the dark, queenly head of his Cecilia.\nHe sat there and dreamed like any boy. And it was at this propitious\nmoment that Rosemary West stepped aside from the by-path and stood\nbeside him in that dangerous, spell-weaving place. John Meredith stood\nup as she came in and saw her--REALLY saw her--for the first time.\n\nHe had met her in his church once or twice and shaken hands with her\nabstractedly as he did with anyone he happened to encounter on his\nway down the aisle. He had never met her elsewhere, for the Wests were\nEpiscopalians, with church affinities in Lowbridge, and no occasion for\ncalling upon them had ever arisen. Before to-night, if anyone had asked\nJohn Meredith what Rosemary West looked like he would not have had the\nslightest notion. But he was never to forget her, as she appeared to him\nin the glamour of kind moonlight by the spring.\n\nShe was certainly not in the least like Cecilia, who had always been\nhis ideal of womanly beauty. Cecilia had been small and dark and\nvivacious--Rosemary West was tall and fair and placid, yet John Meredith\nthought he had never seen so beautiful a woman.\n\nShe was bareheaded and her golden hair--hair of a warm gold, \"molasses\ntaffy\" colour as Di Blythe had said--was pinned in sleek, close coils\nover her head; she had large, tranquil, blue eyes that always seemed\nfull of friendliness, a high white forehead and a finely shaped face.\n\nRosemary West was always called a \"sweet woman.\" She was so sweet that\neven her high-bred, stately air had never gained for her the reputation\nof being \"stuck-up,\" which it would inevitably have done in the case\nof anyone else in Glen St. Mary. Life had taught her to be brave, to\nbe patient, to love, to forgive. She had watched the ship on which\nher lover went sailing out of Four Winds Harbour into the sunset. But,\nthough she watched long, she had never seen it coming sailing back.\nThat vigil had taken girlhood from her eyes, yet she kept her youth to\na marvellous degree. Perhaps this was because she always seemed to\npreserve that attitude of delighted surprise towards life which most of\nus leave behind in childhood--an attitude which not only made Rosemary\nherself seem young, but flung a pleasing illusion of youth over the\nconsciousness of every one who talked to her.\n\nJohn Meredith was startled by her loveliness and Rosemary was startled\nby his presence. She had never thought she would find anyone by that\nremote spring, least of all the recluse of Glen St. Mary manse. She\nalmost dropped the heavy armful of books she was carrying home from the\nGlen lending library, and then, to cover her confusion, she told one of\nthose small fibs which even the best of women do tell at times.\n\n\"I--I came for a drink,\" she said, stammering a little, in answer to\nMr. Meredith's grave \"good evening, Miss West.\" She felt that she was\nan unpardonable goose and she longed to shake herself. But John Meredith\nwas not a vain man and he knew she would likely have been as much\nstartled had she met old Elder Clow in that unexpected fashion. Her\nconfusion put him at ease and he forgot to be shy; besides, even the\nshyest of men can sometimes be quite audacious in moonlight.\n\n\"Let me get you a cup,\" he said smiling. There was a cup near by, if\nhe had only known it, a cracked, handleless blue cup secreted under\nthe maple by the Rainbow Valley children; but he did not know it, so he\nstepped out to one of the birch-trees and stripped a bit of its white\nskin away. Deftly he fashioned this into a three-cornered cup, filled it\nfrom the spring, and handed it to Rosemary.\n\nRosemary took it and drank every drop to punish herself for her fib, for\nshe was not in the least thirsty, and to drink a fairly large cupful of\nwater when you are not thirsty is somewhat of an ordeal. Yet the memory\nof that draught was to be very pleasant to Rosemary. In after years it\nseemed to her that there was something sacramental about it. Perhaps\nthis was because of what the minister did when she handed him back the\ncup. He stooped again and filled it and drank of it himself. It was only\nby accident that he put his lips just where Rosemary had put hers, and\nRosemary knew it. Nevertheless, it had a curious significance for her.\nThey two had drunk of the same cup. She remembered idly that an old\naunt of hers used to say that when two people did this their after-lives\nwould be linked in some fashion, whether for good or ill.\n\nJohn Meredith held the cup uncertainly. He did not know what to do with\nit. The logical thing would have been to toss it away, but somehow he\nwas disinclined to do this. Rosemary held out her hand for it.\n\n\"Will you let me have it?\" she said. \"You made it so knackily. I never\nsaw anyone make a birch cup so since my little brother used to make them\nlong ago--before he died.\"\n\n\"I learned how to make them when _I_ was a boy, camping out one summer.\nAn old hunter taught me,\" said Mr. Meredith. \"Let me carry your books,\nMiss West.\"\n\nRosemary was startled into another fib and said oh, they were not heavy.\nBut the minister took them from her with quite a masterful air and they\nwalked away together. It was the first time Rosemary had stood by the\nvalley spring without thinking of Martin Crawford. The mystic tryst had\nbeen broken.\n\nThe little by-path wound around the marsh and then struck up the long\nwooded hill on the top of which Rosemary lived. Beyond, through the\ntrees, they could see the moonlight shining across the level summer\nfields. But the little path was shadowy and narrow. Trees crowded\nover it, and trees are never quite as friendly to human beings after\nnightfall as they are in daylight. They wrap themselves away from us.\nThey whisper and plot furtively. If they reach out a hand to us it has\na hostile, tentative touch. People walking amid trees after night\nalways draw closer together instinctively and involuntarily, making an\nalliance, physical and mental, against certain alien powers around them.\nRosemary's dress brushed against John Meredith as they walked. Not even\nan absent-minded minister, who was after all a young man still, though\nhe firmly believed he had outlived romance, could be insensible to the\ncharm of the night and the path and the companion.\n\nIt is never quite safe to think we have done with life. When we imagine\nwe have finished our story fate has a trick of turning the page and\nshowing us yet another chapter. These two people each thought their\nhearts belonged irrevocably to the past; but they both found their walk\nup that hill very pleasant. Rosemary thought the Glen minister was by\nno means as shy and tongue-tied as he had been represented. He seemed to\nfind no difficulty in talking easily and freely. Glen housewives would\nhave been amazed had they heard him. But then so many Glen housewives\ntalked only gossip and the price of eggs, and John Meredith was not\ninterested in either. He talked to Rosemary of books and music and\nwide-world doings and something of his own history, and found that she\ncould understand and respond. Rosemary, it appeared, possessed a book\nwhich Mr. Meredith had not read and wished to read. She offered to lend\nit to him and when they reached the old homestead on the hill he went in\nto get it.\n\nThe house itself was an old-fashioned gray one, hung with vines, through\nwhich the light in the sitting-room winked in friendly fashion. It\nlooked down the Glen, over the harbour, silvered in the moonlight, to\nthe sand-dunes and the moaning ocean. They walked in through a garden\nthat always seemed to smell of roses, even when no roses were in bloom.\nThere was a sisterhood of lilies at the gate and a ribbon of asters on\neither side of the broad walk, and a lacery of fir trees on the hill's\nedge beyond the house.\n\n\"You have the whole world at your doorstep here,\" said John Meredith,\nwith a long breath. \"What a view--what an outlook! At times I feel\nstifled down there in the Glen. You can breathe up here.\"\n\n\"It is calm to-night,\" said Rosemary laughing. \"If there were a wind it\nwould blow your breath away. We get 'a' the airts the wind can blow' up\nhere. This place should be called Four Winds instead of the Harbour.\"\n\n\"I like wind,\" he said. \"A day when there is no wind seems to me DEAD. A\nwindy day wakes me up.\" He gave a conscious laugh. \"On a calm day I fall\ninto day dreams. No doubt you know my reputation, Miss West. If I cut\nyou dead the next time we meet don't put it down to bad manners. Please\nunderstand that it is only abstraction and forgive me--and speak to me.\"\n\nThey found Ellen West in the sitting room when they went in. She laid\nher glasses down on the book she had been reading and looked at them\nin amazement tinctured with something else. But she shook hands amiably\nwith Mr. Meredith and he sat down and talked to her, while Rosemary\nhunted out his book.\n\nEllen West was ten years older than Rosemary, and so different from her\nthat it was hard to believe they were sisters. She was dark and massive,\nwith black hair, thick, black eyebrows and eyes of the clear, slaty blue\nof the gulf water in a north wind. She had a rather stern, forbidding\nlook, but she was in reality very jolly, with a hearty, gurgling laugh\nand a deep, mellow, pleasant voice with a suggestion of masculinity\nabout it. She had once remarked to Rosemary that she would really like\nto have a talk with that Presbyterian minister at the Glen, to see if\nhe could find a word to say to a woman when he was cornered. She had her\nchance now and she tackled him on world politics. Miss Ellen, who was\na great reader, had been devouring a book on the Kaiser of Germany, and\nshe demanded Mr. Meredith's opinion of him.\n\n\"A dangerous man,\" was his answer.\n\n\"I believe you!\" Miss Ellen nodded. \"Mark my words, Mr. Meredith, that\nman is going to fight somebody yet. He's ACHING to. He is going to set\nthe world on fire.\"\n\n\"If you mean that he will wantonly precipitate a great war I hardly\nthink so,\" said Mr. Meredith. \"The day has gone by for that sort of\nthing.\"\n\n\"Bless you, it hasn't,\" rumbled Ellen. \"The day never goes by for men\nand nations to make asses of themselves and take to the fists. The\nmillenniun isn't THAT near, Mr. Meredith, and YOU don't think it is any\nmore than I do. As for this Kaiser, mark my words, he is going to make a\nheap of trouble\"--and Miss Ellen prodded her book emphatically with\nher long finger. \"Yes, if he isn't nipped in the bud he's going to\nmake trouble. WE'LL live to see it--you and I will live to see it, Mr.\nMeredith. And who is going to nip him? England should, but she won't.\nWHO is going to nip him? Tell me that, Mr. Meredith.\"\n\nMr. Meredith couldn't tell her, but they plunged into a discussion of\nGerman militarism that lasted long after Rosemary had found the book.\nRosemary said nothing, but sat in a little rocker behind Ellen and\nstroked an important black cat meditatively. John Meredith hunted big\ngame in Europe with Ellen, but he looked oftener at Rosemary than at\nEllen, and Ellen noticed it. After Rosemary had gone to the door with\nhim and come back Ellen rose and looked at her accusingly.\n\n\"Rosemary West, that man has a notion of courting you.\"\n\nRosemary quivered. Ellen's speech was like a blow to her. It rubbed all\nthe bloom off the pleasant evening. But she would not let Ellen see how\nit hurt her.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" she said, and laughed, a little too carelessly. \"You see\na beau for me in every bush, Ellen. Why he told me all about his wife\nto-night--how much she was to him--how empty her death had left the\nworld.\"\n\n\"Well, that may be HIS way of courting,\" retorted Ellen. \"Men have all\nkinds of ways, I understand. But don't forget your promise, Rosemary.\"\n\n\"There is no need of my either forgetting or remembering it,\" said\nRosemary, a little wearily. \"YOU forget that I'm an old maid, Ellen. It\nis only your sisterly delusion that I am still young and blooming and\ndangerous. Mr. Meredith merely wants to be a friend--if he wants that\nmuch itself. He'll forget us both long before he gets back to the\nmanse.\"\n\n\"I've no objection to your being friends with him,\" conceded Ellen,\n\"but it musn't go beyond friendship, remember. I'm always suspicious of\nwidowers. They are not given to romantic ideas about friendship. They're\napt to mean business. As for this Presbyterian man, what do they call\nhim shy for? He's not a bit shy, though he may be absent-minded--so\nabsent-minded that he forgot to say goodnight to ME when you started to\ngo to the door with him. He's got brains, too. There's so few men round\nhere that can talk sense to a body. I've enjoyed the evening. I wouldn't\nmind seeing more of him. But no philandering, Rosemary, mind you--no\nphilandering.\"\n\nRosemary was quite used to being warned by Ellen from philandering if\nshe so much as talked five minutes to any marriageable man under eighty\nor over eighteen. She had always laughed at the warning with unfeigned\namusement. This time it did not amuse her--it irritated her a little.\nWho wanted to philander?\n\n\"Don't be such a goose, Ellen,\" she said with unaccustomed shortness as\nshe took her lamp. She went upstairs without saying goodnight.\n\nEllen shook her head dubiously and looked at the black cat.\n\n\"What is she so cross about, St. George?\" she asked. \"When you howl\nyou're hit, I've always heard, George. But she promised, Saint--she\npromised, and we Wests always keep our word. So it won't matter if he\ndoes want to philander, George. She promised. I won't worry.\"\n\nUpstairs, in her room, Rosemary sat for a long while looking out of the\nwindow across the moonlit garden to the distant, shining harbour. She\nfelt vaguely upset and unsettled. She was suddenly tired of outworn\ndreams. And in the garden the petals of the last red rose were scattered\nby a sudden little wind. Summer was over--it was autumn.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. MRS. ALEC DAVIS MAKES A CALL\n\nJohn Meredith walked slowly home. At first he thought a little about\nRosemary, but by the time he reached Rainbow Valley he had forgotten all\nabout her and was meditating on a point regarding German theology which\nEllen had raised. He passed through Rainbow Valley and knew it not. The\ncharm of Rainbow Valley had no potency against German theology. When he\nreached the manse he went to his study and took down a bulky volume in\norder to see which had been right, he or Ellen. He remained immersed in\nits mazes until dawn, struck a new trail of speculation and pursued it\nlike a sleuth hound for the next week, utterly lost to the world, his\nparish and his family. He read day and night; he forgot to go to his\nmeals when Una was not there to drag him to them; he never thought about\nRosemary or Ellen again. Old Mrs. Marshall, over-harbour, was very ill\nand sent for him, but the message lay unheeded on his desk and gathered\ndust. Mrs. Marshall recovered but never forgave him. A young couple came\nto the manse to be married and Mr. Meredith, with unbrushed hair, in\ncarpet slippers and faded dressing gown, married them. To be sure, he\nbegan by reading the funeral service to them and got along as far as\n\"ashes to ashes and dust to dust\" before he vaguely suspected that\nsomething was wrong.\n\n\"Dear me,\" he said absently, \"that is strange--very strange.\"\n\nThe bride, who was very nervous, began to cry. The bridegroom, who was\nnot in the least nervous, giggled.\n\n\"Please, sir, I think you're burying us instead of marrying us,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said Mr. Meredith, as it it did not matter much. He turned\nup the marriage service and got through with it, but the bride never\nfelt quite properly married for the rest of her life.\n\nHe forgot his prayer-meeting again--but that did not matter, for it was\na wet night and nobody came. He might even have forgotten his Sunday\nservice if it had not been for Mrs. Alec Davis. Aunt Martha came in on\nSaturday afternoon and told him that Mrs. Davis was in the parlour and\nwanted to see him. Mr. Meredith sighed. Mrs. Davis was the only woman in\nGlen St. Mary church whom he positively detested. Unfortunately, she\nwas also the richest, and his board of managers had warned Mr. Meredith\nagainst offending her. Mr. Meredith seldom thought of such a worldly\nmatter as his stipend; but the managers were more practical. Also, they\nwere astute. Without mentioning money, they contrived to instil into\nMr. Meredith's mind a conviction that he should not offend Mrs. Davis.\nOtherwise, he would likely have forgotten all about her as soon as Aunt\nMartha had gone out. As it was, he turned down his Ewald with a feeling\nof annoyance and went across the hall to the parlour.\n\nMrs. Davis was sitting on the sofa, looking about her with an air of\nscornful disapproval.\n\nWhat a scandalous room! There were no curtains on the window. Mrs. Davis\ndid not know that Faith and Una had taken them down the day before to\nuse as court trains in one of their plays and had forgotten to put them\nup again, but she could not have accused those windows more fiercely\nif she had known. The blinds were cracked and torn. The pictures on the\nwalls were crooked; the rugs were awry; the vases were full of faded\nflowers; the dust lay in heaps--literally in heaps.\n\n\"What are we coming to?\" Mrs. Davis asked herself, and then primmed up\nher unbeautiful mouth.\n\nJerry and Carl had been whooping and sliding down the banisters as she\ncame through the hall. They did not see her and continued whooping and\nsliding, and Mrs. Davis was convinced they did it on purpose. Faith's\npet rooster ambled through the hall, stood in the parlour doorway and\nlooked at her. Not liking her looks, he did not venture in. Mrs. Davis\ngave a scornful sniff. A pretty manse, indeed, where roosters paraded\nthe halls and stared people out of countenance.\n\n\"Shoo, there,\" commanded Mrs. Davis, poking her flounced,\nchangeable-silk parasol at him.\n\nAdam shooed. He was a wise rooster and Mrs. Davis had wrung the necks\nof so many roosters with her own fair hands in the course of her fifty\nyears that an air of the executioner seemed to hang around her. Adam\nscuttled through the hall as the minister came in.\n\nMr. Meredith still wore slippers and dressing gown, and his dark hair\nstill fell in uncared-for locks over his high brow. But he looked the\ngentleman he was; and Mrs. Alec Davis, in her silk dress and beplumed\nbonnet, and kid gloves and gold chain looked the vulgar, coarse-souled\nwoman she was. Each felt the antagonisn of the other's personality. Mr.\nMeredith shrank, but Mrs. Davis girded up her loins for the fray. She\nhad come to the manse to propose a certain thing to the minister and\nshe meant to lose no time in proposing it. She was going to do him\na favour--a great favour--and the sooner he was made aware of it the\nbetter. She had been thinking about it all summer and had come to a\ndecision at last. This was all that mattered, Mrs. Davis thought. When\nshe decided a thing it WAS decided. Nobody else had any say in the\nmatter. That had always been her attitude. When she had made her mind up\nto marry Alec Davis she had married him and that was the end to it. Alec\nhad never known how it happened, but what odds? So in this case--Mrs.\nDavis had arranged everything to her own satisfaction. Now it only\nremained to inform Mr. Meredith.\n\n\"Will you please shut that door?\" said Mrs. Davis, unprimming her\nmouth slightly to say it, but speaking with asperity. \"I have something\nimportant to say, and I can't say it with that racket in the hall.\"\n\nMr. Meredith shut the door meekly. Then he sat down before Mrs. Davis.\nHe was not wholly aware of her yet. His mind was still wrestling with\nEwald's arguments. Mrs. Davis sensed this detachment and it annoyed her.\n\n\"I have come to tell you, Mr. Meredith,\" she said aggressively, \"that I\nhave decided to adopt Una.\"\n\n\"To--adopt--Una!\" Mr. Meredith gazed at her blankly, not understanding\nin the least.\n\n\"Yes. I've been thinking it over for some time. I have often thought of\nadopting a child, since my husband's death. But it seemed so hard to\nget a suitable one. It is very few children I would want to take into MY\nhome. I wouldn't think of taking a home child--some outcast of the slums\nin all probability. And there is hardly ever any other child to be got.\nOne of the fishermen down at the harbour died last fall and left six\nyoungsters. They tried to get me to take one, but I soon gave them\nto understand that I had no idea of adopting trash like that. Their\ngrandfather stole a horse. Besides, they were all boys and I wanted a\ngirl--a quiet, obedient girl that I could train up to be a lady. Una\nwill suit me exactly. She would be a nice little thing if she was\nproperly looked after--so different from Faith. I would never dream of\nadopting Faith. But I'll take Una and I'll give her a good home, and\nup-bringing, Mr. Meredith, and if she behaves herself I'll leave her all\nmy money when I die. Not one of my own relatives shall have a cent of it\nin any case, I'm determined on that. It was the idea of aggravating them\nthat set me to thinking of adopting a child as much as anything in the\nfirst place. Una shall be well dressed and educated and trained, Mr.\nMeredith, and I shall give her music and painting lessons and treat her\nas if she was my own.\"\n\nMr. Meredith was wide enough awake by this time. There was a faint flush\nin his pale cheek and a dangerous light in his fine dark eyes. Was this\nwoman, whose vulgarity and consciousness of money oozed out of her at\nevery pore, actually asking him to give her Una--his dear little wistful\nUna with Cecilia's own dark-blue eyes--the child whom the dying mother\nhad clasped to her heart after the other children had been led weeping\nfrom the room. Cecilia had clung to her baby until the gates of death\nhad shut between them. She had looked over the little dark head to her\nhusband.\n\n\"Take good care of her, John,\" she had entreated. \"She is so small--and\nsensitive. The others can fight their way--but the world will hurt HER.\nOh, John, I don't know what you and she are going to do. You both need\nme so much. But keep her close to you--keep her close to you.\"\n\nThese had been almost her last words except a few unforgettable ones for\nhim alone. And it was this child whom Mrs. Davis had coolly announced\nher intention of taking from him. He sat up straight and looked at Mrs.\nDavis. In spite of the worn dressing gown and the frayed slippers there\nwas something about him that made Mrs. Davis feel a little of the old\nreverence for \"the cloth\" in which she had been brought up. After all,\nthere WAS a certain divinity hedging a minister, even a poor, unworldly,\nabstracted one.\n\n\"I thank you for your kind intentions, Mrs. Davis,\" said Mr. Meredith\nwith a gentle, final, quite awful courtesy, \"but I cannot give you my\nchild.\"\n\nMrs. Davis looked blank. She had never dreamed of his refusing.\n\n\"Why, Mr. Meredith,\" she said in astonishment. \"You must be cr--you\ncan't mean it. You must think it over--think of all the advantages I can\ngive her.\"\n\n\"There is no need to think it over, Mrs. Davis. It is entirely out of\nthe question. All the worldly advantages it is in your power to bestow\non her could not compensate for the loss of a father's love and care. I\nthank you again--but it is not to be thought of.\"\n\nDisappointment angered Mrs. Davis beyond the power of old habit to\ncontrol. Her broad red face turned purple and her voice trembled.\n\n\"I thought you'd be only too glad to let me have her,\" she sneered.\n\n\"Why did you think that?\" asked Mr. Meredith quietly.\n\n\"Because nobody ever supposed you cared anything about any of your\nchildren,\" retorted Mrs. Davis contemptuously. \"You neglect them\nscandalously. It is the talk of the place. They aren't fed and dressed\nproperly, and they're not trained at all. They have no more manners than\na pack of wild Indians. You never think of doing your duty as a father.\nYou let a stray child come here among them for a fortnight and never\ntook any notice of her--a child that swore like a trooper I'm told. YOU\nwouldn't have cared if they'd caught small-pox from her. And Faith made\nan exhibition of herself getting up in preaching and making that speech!\nAnd she rid a pig down the street--under your very eyes I understand.\nThe way they act is past belief and you never lift a finger to stop them\nor try to teach them anything. And now when I offer one of them a good\nhome and good prospects you refuse it and insult me. A pretty father\nyou, to talk of loving and caring for your children!\"\n\n\"That will do, woman!\" said Mr. Meredith. He stood up and looked at Mrs.\nDavis with eyes that made her quail. \"That will do,\" he repeated. \"I\ndesire to hear no more, Mrs. Davis. You have said too much. It may be\nthat I have been remiss in some respects in my duty as a parent, but it\nis not for you to remind me of it in such terms as you have used. Let us\nsay good afternoon.\"\n\nMrs. Davis did not say anything half so amiable as good afternoon, but\nshe took her departure. As she swept past the minister a large, plump\ntoad, which Carl had secreted under the lounge, hopped out almost under\nher feet. Mrs. Davis gave a shriek and in trying to avoid treading on\nthe awful thing, lost her balance and her parasol. She did not exactly\nfall, but she staggered and reeled across the room in a very undignified\nfashion and brought up against the door with a thud that jarred her from\nhead to foot. Mr. Meredith, who had not seen the toad, wondered if she\nhad been attacked with some kind of apoplectic or paralytic seizure,\nand ran in alarm to her assistance. But Mrs. Davis, recovering her feet,\nwaved him back furiously.\n\n\"Don't you dare to touch me,\" she almost shouted. \"This is some more\nof your children's doings, I suppose. This is no fit place for a decent\nwoman. Give me my umbrella and let me go. I'll never darken the doors of\nyour manse or your church again.\"\n\nMr. Meredith picked up the gorgeous parasol meekly enough and gave it to\nher. Mrs. Davis seized it and marched out. Jerry and Carl had given up\nbanister sliding and were sitting on the edge of the veranda with Faith.\nUnfortunately, all three were singing at the tops of their healthy young\nvoices \"There'll be a hot time in the old town to-night.\" Mrs. Davis\nbelieved the song was meant for her and her only. She stopped and shook\nher parasol at them.\n\n\"Your father is a fool,\" she said, \"and you are three young varmints\nthat ought to be whipped within an inch of your lives.\"\n\n\"He isn't,\" cried Faith. \"We're not,\" cried the boys. But Mrs. Davis was\ngone.\n\n\"Goodness, isn't she mad!\" said Jerry. \"And what is a 'varmint' anyhow?\"\n\nJohn Meredith paced up and down the parlour for a few minutes; then he\nwent back to his study and sat down. But he did not return to his German\ntheology. He was too grievously disturbed for that. Mrs. Davis had\nwakened him up with a vengeance. WAS he such a remiss, careless father\nas she had accused him of being? HAD he so scandalously neglected the\nbodily and spiritual welfare of the four little motherless creatures\ndependent on him? WERE his people talking of it as harshly as Mrs. Davis\nhad declared? It must be so, since Mrs. Davis had come to ask for Una in\nthe full and confident belief that he would hand the child over to her\nas unconcernedly and gladly as one might hand over a strayed, unwelcome\nkitten. And, if so, what then?\n\nJohn Meredith groaned and resumed his pacing up and down the dusty,\ndisordered room. What could he do? He loved his children as deeply as\nany father could and he knew, past the power of Mrs. Davis or any of her\nilk, to disturb his conviction, that they loved him devotedly. But WAS\nhe fit to have charge of them? He knew--none better--his weaknesses and\nlimitations. What was needed was a good woman's presence and influence\nand common sense. But how could that be arranged? Even were he able\nto get such a housekeeper it would cut Aunt Martha to the quick. She\nbelieved she could still do all that was meet and necessary. He could\nnot so hurt and insult the poor old woman who had been so kind to him\nand his. How devoted she had been to Cecilia! And Cecilia had asked\nhim to be very considerate of Aunt Martha. To be sure, he suddenly\nremembered that Aunt Martha had once hinted that he ought to marry\nagain. He felt she would not resent a wife as she would a housekeeper.\nBut that was out of the question. He did not wish to marry--he did\nnot and could not care for anyone. Then what could he do? It suddenly\noccurred to him that he would go over to Ingleside and talk over his\ndifficulties with Mrs. Blythe. Mrs. Blythe was one of the few women he\nnever felt shy or tongue-tied with. She was always so sympathetic and\nrefreshing. It might be that she could suggest some solution of his\nproblems. And even if she could not Mr. Meredith felt that he needed\na little decent human companionship after his dose of Mrs.\nDavis--something to take the taste of her out of his soul.\n\nHe dressed hurriedly and ate his supper less abstractedly than usual. It\noccurred to him that it was a poor meal. He looked at his children; they\nwere rosy and healthy looking enough--except Una, and she had never been\nvery strong even when her mother was alive. They were all laughing and\ntalking--certainly they seemed happy. Carl was especially happy because\nhe had two most beautiful spiders crawling around his supper plate.\nTheir voices were pleasant, their manners did not seem bad, they were\nconsiderate of and gentle to one another. Yet Mrs. Davis had said their\nbehaviour was the talk of the congregation.\n\nAs Mr. Meredith went through his gate Dr. Blythe and Mrs. Blythe drove\npast on the road that led to Lowbridge. The minister's face fell. Mrs.\nBlythe was going away--there was no use in going to Ingleside. And\nhe craved a little companionship more than ever. As he gazed rather\nhopelessly over the landscape the sunset light struck on a window of the\nold West homestead on the hill. It flared out rosily like a beacon of\ngood hope. He suddenly remembered Rosemary and Ellen West. He thought\nthat he would relish some of Ellen's pungent conversation. He thought it\nwould be pleasant to see Rosemary's slow, sweet smile and calm,\nheavenly blue eyes again. What did that old poem of Sir Philip Sidney's\nsay?--\"continual comfort in a face\"--that just suited her. And he needed\ncomfort. Why not go and call? He remembered that Ellen had asked him to\ndrop in sometimes and there was Rosemary's book to take back--he ought\nto take it back before he forgot. He had an uneasy suspicion that there\nwere a great many books in his library which he had borrowed at sundry\ntimes and in divers places and had forgotten to take back. It was surely\nhis duty to guard against that in this case. He went back into his\nstudy, got the book, and plunged downward into Rainbow Valley.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. MORE GOSSIP\n\nOn the evening after Mrs. Myra Murray of the over-harbour section had\nbeen buried Miss Cornelia and Mary Vance came up to Ingleside. There\nwere several things concerning which Miss Cornelia wished to unburden\nher soul. The funeral had to be all talked over, of course. Susan and\nMiss Cornelia thrashed this out between them; Anne took no part or\ndelight in such goulish conversations. She sat a little apart and\nwatched the autumnal flame of dahlias in the garden, and the dreaming,\nglamorous harbour of the September sunset. Mary Vance sat beside her,\nknitting meekly. Mary's heart was down in the Rainbow Valley, whence\ncame sweet, distance-softened sounds of children's laughter, but her\nfingers were under Miss Cornelia's eye. She had to knit so many rounds\nof her stocking before she might go to the valley. Mary knit and held\nher tongue, but used her ears.\n\n\"I never saw a nicer looking corpse,\" said Miss Cornelia judicially.\n\"Myra Murray was always a pretty woman--she was a Corey from Lowbridge\nand the Coreys were noted for their good looks.\"\n\n\"I said to the corpse as I passed it, 'poor woman. I hope you are as\nhappy as you look.'\" sighed Susan. \"She had not changed much. That dress\nshe wore was the black satin she got for her daughter's wedding fourteen\nyears ago. Her Aunt told her then to keep it for her funeral, but Myra\nlaughed and said, 'I may wear it to my funeral, Aunty, but I will have a\ngood time out of it first.' And I may say she did. Myra Murray was not a\nwoman to attend her own funeral before she died. Many a time afterwards\nwhen I saw her enjoying herself out in company I thought to myself, 'You\nare a handsome woman, Myra Murray, and that dress becomes you, but it\nwill likely be your shroud at last.' And you see my words have come\ntrue, Mrs. Marshall Elliott.\"\n\nSusan sighed again heavily. She was enjoying herself hugely. A funeral\nwas really a delightful subject of conversation.\n\n\"I always liked to meet Myra,\" said Miss Cornelia. \"She was always so\ngay and cheerful--she made you feel better just by her handshake. Myra\nalways made the best of things.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" asserted Susan. \"Her sister-in-law told me that when the\ndoctor told her at last that he could do nothing for her and she would\nnever rise from that bed again, Myra said quite cheerfully, 'Well, if\nthat is so, I'm thankful the preserving is all done, and I will not\nhave to face the fall house-cleaning. I always liked house-cleaning in\nspring,' she says, 'but I always hated it in the fall. I will get clear\nof it this year, thank goodness.' There are people who would call that\nlevity, Mrs. Marshall Elliott, and I think her sister-in-law was a\nlittle ashamed of it. She said perhaps her sickness had made Myra a\nlittle light-headed. But I said, 'No, Mrs. Murray, do not worry over it.\nIt was just Myra's way of looking at the bright side.'\"\n\n\"Her sister Luella was just the opposite,\" said Miss Cornelia. \"There\nwas no bright side for Luella--there was just black and shades of gray.\nFor years she used always to be declaring she was going to die in a week\nor so. 'I won't be here to burden you long,' she would tell her family\nwith a groan. And if any of them ventured to talk about their little\nfuture plans she'd groan also and say, 'Ah, _I_ won't be here then.'\nWhen I went to see her I always agreed with her and it made her so mad\nthat she was always quite a lot better for several days afterwards. She\nhas better health now but no more cheerfulness. Myra was so different.\nShe was always doing or saying something to make some one feel good.\nPerhaps the men they married had something to do with it. Luella's man\nwas a Tartar, believe ME, while Jim Murray was decent, as men go. He\nlooked heart-broken to-day. It isn't often I feel sorry for a man at his\nwife's funeral, but I did feel for Jim Murray.\"\n\n\"No wonder he looked sad. He will not get a wife like Myra again in a\nhurry,\" said Susan. \"Maybe he will not try, since his children are all\ngrown up and Mirabel is able to keep house. But there is no predicting\nwhat a widower may or may not do and I, for one, will not try.\"\n\n\"We'll miss Myra terrible in church,\" said Miss Cornelia. \"She was\nsuch a worker. Nothing ever stumped HER. If she couldn't get over a\ndifficulty she'd get around it, and if she couldn't get around it she'd\npretend it wasn't there--and generally it wasn't. 'I'll keep a stiff\nupper lip to my journey's end,' said she to me once. Well, she has ended\nher journey.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" asked Anne suddenly, coming back from dreamland. \"I\ncan't picture HER journey as being ended. Can YOU think of her sitting\ndown and folding her hands--that eager, asking spirit of hers, with its\nfine adventurous outlook? No, I think in death she just opened a gate\nand went through--on--on--to new, shining adventures.\"\n\n\"Maybe--maybe,\" assented Miss Cornelia. \"Do you know, Anne dearie, I\nnever was much taken with this everlasting rest doctrine myself--though\nI hope it isn't heresy to say so. I want to bustle round in heaven the\nsame as here. And I hope there'll be a celestial substitute for pies and\ndoughnuts--something that has to be MADE. Of course, one does get awful\ntired at times--and the older you are the tireder you get. But the\nvery tiredest could get rested in something short of eternity, you'd\nthink--except, perhaps, a lazy man.\"\n\n\"When I meet Myra Murray again,\" said Anne, \"I want to see her coming\ntowards me, brisk and laughing, just as she always did here.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Dr. dear,\" said Susan, in a shocked tone, \"you surely do not\nthink that Myra will be laughing in the world to come?\"\n\n\"Why not, Susan? Do you think we will be crying there?\"\n\n\"No, no, Mrs. Dr. dear, do not misunderstand me. I do not think we shall\nbe either crying or laughing.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Susan, driven to it, \"it is my opinion, Mrs. Dr. dear, that\nwe shall just look solemn and holy.\"\n\n\"And do you really think, Susan,\" said Anne, looking solemn enough,\n\"that either Myra Murray or I could look solemn and holy all the\ntime--ALL the time, Susan?\"\n\n\"Well,\" admitted Susan reluctantly, \"I might go so far as to say that\nyou both would have to smile now and again, but I can never admit that\nthere will be laughing in heaven. The idea seems really irreverent, Mrs.\nDr. dear.\"\n\n\"Well, to come back to earth,\" said Miss Cornelia, \"who can we get to\ntake Myra's class in Sunday School? Julia Clow has been teaching it\nsince Myra took ill, but she's going to town for the winter and we'll\nhave to get somebody else.\"\n\n\"I heard that Mrs. Laurie Jamieson wanted it,\" said Anne. \"The Jamiesons\nhave come to church very regularly since they moved to the Glen from\nLowbridge.\"\n\n\"New brooms!\" said Miss Cornelia dubiously. \"Wait till they've gone\nregularly for a year.\"\n\n\"You cannot depend on Mrs. Jamieson a bit, Mrs. Dr. dear,\" said Susan\nsolemnly. \"She died once and when they were measuring her for her\ncoffin, after laying her out just beautiful, did she not go and come\nback to life! Now, Mrs. Dr. dear, you know you CANNOT depend on a woman\nlike that.\"\n\n\"She might turn Methodist at any moment,\" said Miss Cornelia. \"They tell\nme they went to the Methodist Church at Lowbridge quite as often as to\nthe Presbyterian. I haven't caught them at it here yet, but I would not\napprove of taking Mrs. Jamieson into the Sunday School. Yet we must not\noffend them. We are losing too many people, by death or bad temper. Mrs.\nAlec Davis has left the church, no one knows why. She told the managers\nthat she would never pay another cent to Mr. Meredith's salary. Of\ncourse, most people say that the children offended her, but somehow I\ndon't think so. I tried to pump Faith, but all I could get out of her\nwas that Mrs. Davis had come, seemingly in high good humour, to see her\nfather, and had left in an awful rage, calling them all 'varmints!'\"\n\n\"Varmints, indeed!\" said Susan furiously. \"Does Mrs. Alec Davis forget\nthat her uncle on her mother's side was suspected of poisoning his\nwife? Not that it was ever proved, Mrs. Dr. dear, and it does not do to\nbelieve all you hear. But if _I_ had an uncle whose wife died without\nany satisfactory reason, _I_ would not go about the country calling\ninnocent children varmints.\"\n\n\"The point is,\" said Miss Cornelia, \"that Mrs. Davis paid a large\nsubscription, and how its loss is going to be made up is a problem.\nAnd if she turns the other Douglases against Mr. Meredith, as she will\ncertainly try to do, he will just have to go.\"\n\n\"I do not think Mrs. Alec Davis is very well liked by the rest of the\nclan,\" said Susan. \"It is not likely she will be able to influence\nthem.\"\n\n\"But those Douglases all hang together so. If you touch one, you touch\nall. We can't do without them, so much is certain. They pay half the\nsalary. They are not mean, whatever else may be said of them. Norman\nDouglas used to give a hundred a year long ago before he left.\"\n\n\"What did he leave for?\" asked Anne.\n\n\"He declared a member of the session cheated him in a cow deal. He\nhasn't come to church for twenty years. His wife used to come regular\nwhile she was alive, poor thing, but he never would let her pay\nanything, except one red cent every Sunday. She felt dreadfully\nhumiliated. I don't know that he was any too good a husband to her,\nthough she was never heard to complain. But she always had a cowed look.\nNorman Douglas didn't get the woman he wanted thirty years ago and the\nDouglases never liked to put up with second best.\"\n\n\"Who was the woman he did want.\"\n\n\"Ellen West. They weren't engaged exactly, I believe, but they went\nabout together for two years. And then they just broke off--nobody\never know why. Just some silly quarrel, I suppose. And Norman went and\nmarried Hester Reese before his temper had time to cool--married her\njust to spite Ellen, I haven't a doubt. So like a man! Hester was a nice\nlittle thing, but she never had much spirit and he broke what little she\nhad. She was too meek for Norman. He needed a woman who could stand up\nto him. Ellen would have kept him in fine order and he would have liked\nher all the better for it. He despised Hester, that is the truth, just\nbecause she always gave in to him. I used to hear him say many a time,\nlong ago when he was a young fellow 'Give me a spunky woman--spunk for\nme every time.' And then he went and married a girl who couldn't say boo\nto a goose--man-like. That family of Reeses were just vegetables. They\nwent through the motions of living, but they didn't LIVE.\"\n\n\"Russell Reese used his first wife's wedding-ring to marry his second,\"\nsaid Susan reminiscently. \"That was TOO economical in my opinion, Mrs.\nDr. dear. And his brother John has his own tombstone put up in the\nover-harbour graveyard, with everything on it but the date of death, and\nhe goes and looks at it every Sunday. Most folks would not consider that\nmuch fun, but it is plain he does. People do have such different ideas\nof enjoyment. As for Norman Douglas, he is a perfect heathen. When the\nlast minister asked him why he never went to church he said 'Too many\nugly women there, parson--too many ugly women!' I should like to go to\nsuch a man, Mrs. Dr. dear, and say to him solemnly, 'There is a hell!'\"\n\n\"Oh, Norman doesn't believe there is such a place,\" said Miss Cornelia.\n\"I hope he'll find out his mistake when he comes to die. There, Mary,\nyou've knit your three inches and you can go and play with the children\nfor half an hour.\"\n\nMary needed no second bidding. She flew to Rainbow Valley with a heart\nas light as her heels, and in the course of conversation told Faith\nMeredith all about Mrs. Alec Davis.\n\n\"And Mrs. Elliott says that she'll turn all the Douglases against your\nfather and then he'll have to leave the Glen because his salary won't\nbe paid,\" concluded Mary. \"_I_ don't know what is to be done, honest to\ngoodness. If only old Norman Douglas would come back to church and pay,\nit wouldn't be so bad. But he won't--and the Douglases will leave--and\nyou all will have to go.\"\n\nFaith carried a heavy heart to bed with her that night. The thought of\nleaving the Glen was unbearable. Nowhere else in the world were there\nsuch chums as the Blythes. Her little heart had been wrung when they\nhad left Maywater--she had shed many bitter tears when she parted with\nMaywater chums and the old manse there where her mother had lived and\ndied. She could not contemplate calmly the thought of such another and\nharder wrench. She COULDN'T leave Glen St. Mary and dear Rainbow Valley\nand that delicious graveyard.\n\n\"It's awful to be minister's family,\" groaned Faith into her pillow.\n\"Just as soon as you get fond of a place you are torn up by the roots.\nI'll never, never, NEVER marry a minister, no matter how nice he is.\"\n\nFaith sat up in bed and looked out of the little vine-hung window. The\nnight was very still, the silence broken only by Una's soft breathing.\nFaith felt terribly alone in the world. She could see Glen St. Mary\nlying under the starry blue meadows of the autumn night. Over the\nvalley a light shone from the girls' room at Ingleside, and another from\nWalter's room. Faith wondered if poor Walter had toothache again. Then\nshe sighed, with a little passing sigh of envy of Nan and Di. They had a\nmother and a settled home--THEY were not at the mercy of people who got\nangry without any reason and called you a varmint. Away beyond the Glen,\namid fields that were very quiet with sleep, another light was burning.\nFaith knew it shone in the house where Norman Douglas lived. He was\nreputed to sit up all hours of the night reading. Mary had said if he\ncould only be induced to return to the church all would be well. And\nwhy not? Faith looked at a big, low star hanging over the tall, pointed\nspruce at the gate of the Methodist Church and had an inspiration. She\nknew what ought to be done and she, Faith Meredith, would do it. She\nwould make everything right. With a sigh of satisfaction, she turned\nfrom the lonely, dark world and cuddled down beside Una.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. TIT FOR TAT\n\nWith Faith, to decide was to act. She lost no time in carrying out the\nidea. As soon as she came home from school the next day she left the\nmanse and made her way down the Glen. Walter Blythe joined her as she\npassed the post office.\n\n\"I'm going to Mrs. Elliott's on an errand for mother,\" he said. \"Where\nare you going, Faith?\"\n\n\"I am going somewhere on church business,\" said Faith loftily. She did\nnot volunteer any further information and Walter felt rather snubbed.\nThey walked on in silence for a little while. It was a warm, windy\nevening with a sweet, resinous air. Beyond the sand dunes were gray\nseas, soft and beautiful. The Glen brook bore down a freight of gold\nand crimson leaves, like fairy shallops. In Mr. James Reese's buckwheat\nstubble-land, with its beautiful tones of red and brown, a crow\nparliament was being held, whereat solemn deliberations regarding the\nwelfare of crowland were in progress. Faith cruelly broke up the august\nassembly by climbing up on the fence and hurling a broken rail at it.\nInstantly the air was filled with flapping black wings and indignant\ncaws.\n\n\"Why did you do that?\" said Walter reproachfully. \"They were having such\na good time.\"\n\n\"Oh, I hate crows,\" said Faith airily. \"The are so black and sly I feel\nsure they're hypocrites. They steal little birds' eggs out of their\nnests, you know. I saw one do it on our lawn last spring. Walter, what\nmakes you so pale to-day? Did you have the toothache again last night?\"\n\nWalter shivered.\n\n\"Yes--a raging one. I couldn't sleep a wink--so I just paced up and down\nthe floor and imagined I was an early Christian martyr being tortured\nat the command of Nero. That helped ever so much for a while--and then I\ngot so bad I couldn't imagine anything.\"\n\n\"Did you cry?\" asked Faith anxiously.\n\n\"No--but I lay down on the floor and groaned,\" admitted Walter. \"Then\nthe girls came in and Nan put cayenne pepper in it--and that made\nit worse--Di made me hold a swallow of cold water in my mouth--and I\ncouldn't stand it, so they called Susan. Susan said it served me right\nfor sitting up in the cold garret yesterday writing poetry trash. But\nshe started up the kitchen fire and got me a hot-water bottle and it\nstopped the toothache. As soon as I felt better I told Susan my poetry\nwasn't trash and she wasn't any judge. And she said no, thank goodness\nshe was not and she did not know anything about poetry except that it\nwas mostly a lot of lies. Now you know, Faith, that isn't so. That is\none reason why I like writing poetry--you can say so many things in it\nthat are true in poetry but wouldn't be true in prose. I told Susan\nso, but she said to stop my jawing and go to sleep before the water got\ncold, or she'd leave me to see if rhyming would cure toothache, and she\nhoped it would be a lesson to me.\"\n\n\"Why don't you go to the dentist at Lowbridge and get the tooth out?\"\n\nWalter shivered again.\n\n\"They want me to--but I can't. It would hurt so.\"\n\n\"Are you afraid of a little pain?\" asked Faith contemptuously.\n\nWalter flushed.\n\n\"It would be a BIG pain. I hate being hurt. Father said he wouldn't\ninsist on my going--he'd wait until I'd made up my own mind to go.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't hurt as long as the toothache,\" argued Faith, \"You've had\nfive spells of toothache. If you'd just go and have it out there'd be no\nmore bad nights. _I_ had a tooth out once. I yelled for a moment, but it\nwas all over then--only the bleeding.\"\n\n\"The bleeding is worst of all--it's so ugly,\" cried Walter. \"It just\nmade me sick when Jem cut his foot last summer. Susan said I looked more\nlike fainting than Jem did. But I couldn't hear to see Jem hurt, either.\nSomebody is always getting hurt, Faith--and it's awful. I just can't\nBEAR to see things hurt. It makes me just want to run--and run--and\nrun--till I can't hear or see them.\"\n\n\"There's no use making a fuss over anyone getting hurt,\" said Faith,\ntossing her curls. \"Of course, if you've hurt yourself very bad, you\nhave to yell--and blood IS messy--and I don't like seeing other people\nhurt, either. But I don't want to run--I want to go to work and help\nthem. Your father HAS to hurt people lots of times to cure them. What\nwould they do if HE ran away?\"\n\n\"I didn't say I WOULD run. I said I WANTED to run. That's a different\nthing. I want to help people, too. But oh, I wish there weren't any\nugly, dreadful things in the world. I wish everything was glad and\nbeautiful.\"\n\n\"Well, don't let's think of what isn't,\" said Faith. \"After all, there's\nlots of fun in being alive. You wouldn't have toothache if you were\ndead, but still, wouldn't you lots rather be alive than dead? I would,\na hundred times. Oh, here's Dan Reese. He's been down to the harbour for\nfish.\"\n\n\"I hate Dan Reese,\" said Walter.\n\n\"So do I. All us girls do. I'm just going to walk past and never take\nthe least notice of him. You watch me!\"\n\nFaith accordingly stalked past Dan with her chin out and an expression\nof scorn that bit into his soul. He turned and shouted after her.\n\n\"Pig-girl! Pig-girl!! Pig-girl!!!\" in a crescendo of insult.\n\nFaith walked on, seemingly oblivious. But her lip trembled slightly with\na sense of outrage. She knew she was no match for Dan Reese when it\ncame to an exchange of epithets. She wished Jem Blythe had been with\nher instead of Walter. If Dan Reese had dared to call her a pig-girl in\nJem's hearing, Jem would have wiped up the dust with him. But it never\noccurred to Faith to expect Walter to do it, or blame him for not doing\nit. Walter, she knew, never fought other boys. Neither did Charlie Clow\nof the north road. The strange part was that, while she despised Charlie\nfor a coward, it never occurred to her to disdain Walter. It was\nsimply that he seemed to her an inhabitant of a world of his own, where\ndifferent traditions prevailed. Faith would as soon have expected a\nstarry-eyed young angel to pummel dirty, freckled Dan Reese for her as\nWalter Blythe. She would not have blamed the angel and she did not blame\nWalter Blythe. But she wished that sturdy Jem or Jerry had been there\nand Dan's insult continued to rankle in her soul.\n\nWalter was pale no longer. He had flushed crimson and his beautiful eyes\nwere clouded with shame and anger. He knew that he ought to have avenged\nFaith. Jem would have sailed right in and made Dan eat his words with\nbitter sauce. Ritchie Warren would have overwhelmed Dan with worse\n\"names\" than Dan had called Faith. But Walter could not--simply could\nnot--\"call names.\" He knew he would get the worst of it. He could never\nconceive or utter the vulgar, ribald insults of which Dan Reese had\nunlimited command. And as for the trial by fist, Walter couldn't fight.\nHe hated the idea. It was rough and painful--and, worst of all, it\nwas ugly. He never could understand Jem's exultation in an occasional\nconflict. But he wished he COULD fight Dan Reese. He was horribly\nashamed because Faith Meredith had been insulted in his presence and he\nhad not tried to punish her insulter. He felt sure she must despise him.\nShe had not even spoken to him since Dan had called her pig-girl. He was\nglad when they came to the parting of the ways.\n\nFaith, too, was relieved, though for a different reason. She wanted\nto be alone because she suddenly felt rather nervous about her errand.\nImpulse had cooled, especially since Dan had bruised her self-respect.\nShe must go through with it, but she no longer had enthusiasm to sustain\nher. She was going to see Norman Douglas and ask him to come back to\nchurch, and she began to be afraid of him. What had seemed so easy and\nsimple up at the Glen seemed very different down here. She had heard a\ngood deal about Norman Douglas, and she knew that even the biggest boys\nin school were afraid of him. Suppose he called her something nasty--she\nhad heard he was given to that. Faith could not endure being called\nnames--they subdued her far more quickly than a physical blow. But she\nwould go on--Faith Meredith always went on. If she did not her father\nmight have to leave the Glen.\n\nAt the end of the long lane Faith came to the house--a big,\nold-fashioned one with a row of soldierly Lombardies marching past\nit. On the back veranda Norman Douglas himself was sitting, reading a\nnewspaper. His big dog was beside him. Behind, in the kitchen, where\nhis housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson, was getting supper, there was a clatter of\ndishes--an angry clatter, for Norman Douglas had just had a quarrel with\nMrs. Wilson, and both were in a very bad temper over it. Consequently,\nwhen Faith stepped on the veranda and Norman Douglas lowered his\nnewspaper she found herself looking into the choleric eyes of an\nirritated man.\n\nNorman Douglas was rather a fine-looking personage in his way. He had\na sweep of long red beard over his broad chest and a mane of red hair,\nungrizzled by the years, on his massive head. His high, white forehead\nwas unwrinkled and his blue eyes could flash still with all the fire of\nhis tempestuous youth. He could be very amiable when he liked, and he\ncould be very terrible. Poor Faith, so anxiously bent on retrieving the\nsituation in regard to the church, had caught him in one of his terrible\nmoods.\n\nHe did not know who she was and he gazed at her with disfavour. Norman\nDouglas liked girls of spirit and flame and laughter. At this moment\nFaith was very pale. She was of the type to which colour means\neverything. Lacking her crimson cheeks she seemed meek and even\ninsignificant. She looked apologetic and afraid, and the bully in Norman\nDouglas's heart stirred.\n\n\"Who the dickens are you? And what do you want here?\" he demanded in his\ngreat resounding voice, with a fierce scowl.\n\nFor once in her life Faith had nothing to say. She had never supposed\nNorman Douglas was like THIS. She was paralyzed with terror of him. He\nsaw it and it made him worse.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" he boomed. \"You look as if you wanted to\nsay something and was scared to say it. What's troubling you? Confound\nit, speak up, can't you?\"\n\nNo. Faith could not speak up. No words would come. But her lips began to\ntremble.\n\n\"For heaven's sake, don't cry,\" shouted Norman. \"I can't stand\nsnivelling. If you've anything to say, say it and have done. Great\nKitty, is the girl possessed of a dumb spirit? Don't look at me like\nthat--I'm human--I haven't got a tail! Who are you--who are you, I say?\"\n\nNorman's voice could have been heard at the harbour. Operations in the\nkitchen were suspended. Mrs. Wilson was listening open-eared and eyed.\nNorman put his huge brown hands on his knees and leaned forward, staring\ninto Faith's pallid, shrinking face. He seemed to loom over her like\nsome evil giant out of a fairy tale. She felt as if he would eat her up\nnext thing, body and bones.\n\n\"I--am--Faith--Meredith,\" she said, in little more than a whisper.\n\n\"Meredith, hey? One of the parson's youngsters, hey? I've heard of\nyou--I've heard of you! Riding on pigs and breaking the Sabbath! A nice\nlot! What do you want here, hey? What do you want of the old pagan,\nhey? _I_ don't ask favours of parsons--and I don't give any. What do you\nwant, I say?\"\n\nFaith wished herself a thousand miles away. She stammered out her\nthought in its naked simplicity.\n\n\"I came--to ask you--to go to church--and pay--to the salary.\"\n\nNorman glared at her. Then he burst forth again.\n\n\"You impudent hussy--you! Who put you up to it, jade? Who put you up to\nit?\"\n\n\"Nobody,\" said poor Faith.\n\n\"That's a lie. Don't lie to me! Who sent you here? It wasn't your\nfather--he hasn't the smeddum of a flea--but he wouldn't send you to do\nwhat he dassn't do himself. I suppose it was some of them confounded old\nmaids at the Glen, was it--was it, hey?\"\n\n\"No--I--I just came myself.\"\n\n\"Do you take me for a fool?\" shouted Norman.\n\n\"No--I thought you were a gentleman,\" said Faith faintly, and certainly\nwithout any thought of being sarcastic.\n\nNorman bounced up.\n\n\"Mind your own business. I don't want to hear another word from you. If\nyou wasn't such a kid I'd teach you to interfere in what doesn't concern\nyou. When I want parsons or pill-dosers I'll send for them. Till I\ndo I'll have no truck with them. Do you understand? Now, get out,\ncheese-face.\"\n\nFaith got out. She stumbled blindly down the steps, out of the yard gate\nand into the lane. Half way up the lane her daze of fear passed away and\na reaction of tingling anger possessed her. By the time she reached\nthe end of the lane she was in such a furious temper as she had never\nexperienced before. Norman Douglas' insults burned in her soul, kindling\na scorching flame. Go home! Not she! She would go straight back and\ntell that old ogre just what she thought of him--she would show him--oh,\nwouldn't she! Cheese-face, indeed!\n\nUnhesitatingly she turned and walked back. The veranda was deserted and\nthe kitchen door shut. Faith opened the door without knocking, and went\nin. Norman Douglas had just sat down at the supper table, but he still\nheld his newspaper. Faith walked inflexibly across the room, caught the\npaper from his hand, flung it on the floor and stamped on it. Then she\nfaced him, with her flashing eyes and scarlet cheeks. She was such a\nhandsome young fury that Norman Douglas hardly recognized her.\n\n\"What's brought you back?\" he growled, but more in bewilderment than\nrage.\n\nUnquailingly she glared back into the angry eyes against which so few\npeople could hold their own.\n\n\"I have come back to tell you exactly what I think of you,\" said Faith\nin clear, ringing tones. \"I am not afraid of you. You are a rude,\nunjust, tyrannical, disagreeable old man. Susan says you are sure to go\nto hell, and I was sorry for you, but I am not now. Your wife never had\na new hat for ten years--no wonder she died. I am going to make faces at\nyou whenever I see you after this. Every time I am behind you you will\nknow what is happening. Father has a picture of the devil in a book in\nhis study, and I mean to go home and write your name under it. You are\nan old vampire and I hope you'll have the Scotch fiddle!\"\n\nFaith did not know what a vampire meant any more than she knew what the\nScotch fiddle was. She had heard Susan use the expressions and gathered\nfrom her tone that both were dire things. But Norman Douglas knew\nwhat the latter meant at least. He had listened in absolute silence to\nFaith's tirade. When she paused for breath, with a stamp of her foot, he\nsuddenly burst into loud laughter. With a mighty slap of hand on knee he\nexclaimed,\n\n\"I vow you've got spunk, after all--I like spunk. Come, sit down--sit\ndown!\"\n\n\"I will not.\" Faith's eyes flashed more passionately. She thought she\nwas being made fun of--treated contemptuously. She would have enjoyed\nanother explosion of rage, but this cut deep. \"I will not sit down in\nyour house. I am going home. But I am glad I came back here and told you\nexactly what my opinion of you is.\"\n\n\"So am I--so am I,\" chuckled Norman. \"I like you--you're fine--you're\ngreat. Such roses--such vim! Did I call her cheese-face? Why, she never\nsmelt a cheese. Sit down. If you'd looked like that at the first, girl!\nSo you'll write my name under the devil's picture, will you? But he's\nblack, girl, he's black--and I'm red. It won't do--it won't do! And you\nhope I'll have the Scotch fiddle, do you? Lord love you, girl, I had\nIT when I was a boy. Don't wish it on me again. Sit down--sit in. We'll\ntak' a cup o' kindness.\"\n\n\"No, thank you,\" said Faith haughtily.\n\n\"Oh, yes, you will. Come, come now, I apologize, girl--I apologize. I\nmade a fool of myself and I'm sorry. Man can't say fairer. Forget and\nforgive. Shake hands, girl--shake hands. She won't--no, she won't! But\nshe must! Look-a-here, girl, if you'll shake hands and break bread with\nme I'll pay what I used to to the salary and I'll go to church the first\nSunday in every month and I'll make Kitty Alec hold her jaw. I'm the\nonly one in the clan can do it. Is it a bargain, girl?\"\n\nIt seemed a bargain. Faith found herself shaking hands with the ogre and\nthen sitting at his board. Her temper was over--Faith's tempers never\nlasted very long--but its excitement still sparkled in her eyes and\ncrimsoned her cheeks. Norman Douglas looked at her admiringly.\n\n\"Go, get some of your best preserves, Wilson,\" he ordered, \"and stop\nsulking, woman, stop sulking. What if we did have a quarrel, woman? A\ngood squall clears the air and briskens things up. But no drizzling and\nfogging afterwards--no drizzling and fogging, woman. I can't stand that.\nTemper in a woman but no tears for me. Here, girl, is some messed up\nmeat and potatoes for you. Begin on that. Wilson has some fancy name for\nit, but I call lit macanaccady. Anything I can't analyze in the\neating line I call macanaccady and anything wet that puzzles me I call\nshallamagouslem. Wilson's tea is shallamagouslem. I swear she makes it\nout of burdocks. Don't take any of the ungodly black liquid--here's some\nmilk for you. What did you say your name was?\"\n\n\"Faith.\"\n\n\"No name that--no name that! I can't stomach such a name. Got any\nother?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Don't like the name, don't like it. There's no smeddum to it. Besides,\nit makes me think of my Aunt Jinny. She called her three girls Faith,\nHope, and Charity. Faith didn't believe in anything--Hope was a born\npessimist--and Charity was a miser. You ought to be called Red Rose--you\nlook like one when you're mad. I'LL call you Red Rose. And you've roped\nme into promising to go to church? But only once a month, remember--only\nonce a month. Come now, girl, will you let me off? I used to pay a\nhundred to the salary every year and go to church. If I promise to pay\ntwo hundred a year will you let me off going to church? Come now!\"\n\n\"No, no, sir,\" said Faith, dimpling roguishly. \"I want you to go to\nchurch, too.\"\n\n\"Well, a bargain is a bargain. I reckon I can stand it twelve times a\nyear. What a sensation it'll make the first Sunday I go! And old Susan\nBaker says I'm going to hell, hey? Do you believe I'll go there--come,\nnow, do you?\"\n\n\"I hope not, sir,\" stammered Faith in some confusion.\n\n\"WHY do you hope not? Come, now, WHY do you hope not? Give us a reason,\ngirl--give us a reason.\"\n\n\"It--it must be a very--uncomfortable place, sir.\"\n\n\"Uncomfortable? All depends on your taste in comfortable, girl. I'd soon\nget tired of angels. Fancy old Susan in a halo, now!\"\n\nFaith did fancy it, and it tickled her so much that she had to laugh.\nNorman eyed her approvingly.\n\n\"See the fun of it, hey? Oh, I like you--you're great. About this church\nbusiness, now--can your father preach?\"\n\n\"He is a splendid preacher,\" said loyal Faith.\n\n\"He is, hey? I'll see--I'll watch out for flaws. He'd better be careful\nwhat he says before ME. I'll catch him--I'll trip him up--I'll keep tabs\non his arguments. I'm bound to have some fun out of this church going\nbusiness. Does he ever preach hell?\"\n\n\"No--o--o--I don't think so.\"\n\n\"Too bad. I like sermons on that subject. You tell him that if he wants\nto keep me in good humour to preach a good rip-roaring sermon on hell\nonce every six months--and the more brimstone the better. I like 'em\nsmoking. And think of all the pleasure he'd give the old maids, too.\nThey'd all keep looking at old Norman Douglas and thinking, 'That's for\nyou, you old reprobate. That's what's in store for YOU!' I'll give an\nextra ten dollars every time you get your father to preach on hell.\nHere's Wilson and the jam. Like that, hey? IT isn't macanaccady. Taste!\"\n\nFaith obediently swallowed the big spoonful Norman held out to her.\nLuckily it WAS good.\n\n\"Best plum jam in the world,\" said Norman, filling a large saucer and\nplumping it down before her. \"Glad you like it. I'll give you a couple\nof jars to take home with you. There's nothing mean about me--never was.\nThe devil can't catch me at THAT corner, anyhow. It wasn't my fault that\nHester didn't have a new hat for ten years. It was her own--she pinched\non hats to save money to give yellow fellows over in China. _I_ never\ngave a cent to missions in my life--never will. Never you try to\nbamboozle me into that! A hundred a year to the salary and church once a\nmonth--but no spoiling good heathens to make poor Christians! Why,\ngirl, they wouldn't be fit for heaven or hell--clean spoiled for either\nplace--clean spoiled. Hey, Wilson, haven't you got a smile on yet? Beats\nall how you women can sulk! _I_ never sulked in my life--it's just one\nbig flash and crash with me and then--pouf--the squall's over and the\nsun is out and you could eat out of my hand.\"\n\nNorman insisted on driving Faith home after supper and he filled the\nbuggy up with apples, cabbages, potatoes and pumpkins and jars of jam.\n\n\"There's a nice little tom-pussy out in the barn. I'll give you that\ntoo, if you'd like it. Say the word,\" he said.\n\n\"No, thank you,\" said Faith decidedly. \"I don't like cats, and besides,\nI have a rooster.\"\n\n\"Listen to her. You can't cuddle a rooster as you can a kitten. Who ever\nheard of petting a rooster? Better take little Tom. I want to find a\ngood home for him.\"\n\n\"No. Aunt Martha has a cat and he would kill a strange kitten.\"\n\nNorman yielded the point rather reluctantly. He gave Faith an exciting\ndrive home, behind his wild two-year old, and when he had let her out at\nthe kitchen door of the manse and dumped his cargo on the back veranda\nhe drove away shouting,\n\n\"It's only once a month--only once a month, mind!\"\n\nFaith went up to bed, feeling a little dizzy and breathless, as if she\nhad just escaped from the grasp of a genial whirlwind. She was happy\nand thankful. No fear now that they would have to leave the Glen and\nthe graveyard and Rainbow Valley. But she fell asleep troubled by a\ndisagreeable subconsciousness that Dan Reese had called her pig-girl and\nthat, having stumbled on such a congenial epithet, he would continue to\ncall her so whenever opportunity offered.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. A DOUBLE VICTORY\n\nNorman Douglas came to church the first Sunday in November and made all\nthe sensation he desired. Mr. Meredith shook hands with him absently on\nthe church steps and hoped dreamily that Mrs. Douglas was well.\n\n\"She wasn't very well just before I buried her ten years ago, but I\nreckon she has better health now,\" boomed Norman, to the horror\nand amusement of every one except Mr. Meredith, who was absorbed in\nwondering if he had made the last head of his sermon as clear as he\nmight have, and hadn't the least idea what Norman had said to him or he\nto Norman.\n\nNorman intercepted Faith at the gate.\n\n\"Kept my word, you see--kept my word, Red Rose. I'm free now till the\nfirst Sunday in December. Fine sermon, girl--fine sermon. Your father\nhas more in his head than he carries on his face. But he contradicted\nhimself once--tell him he contradicted himself. And tell him I want that\nbrimstone sermon in December. Great way to wind up the old year--with\na taste of hell, you know. And what's the matter with a nice tasty\ndiscourse on heaven for New Year's? Though it wouldn't be half as\ninteresting as hell, girl--not half. Only I'd like to know what your\nfather thinks about heaven--he CAN think--rarest thing in the world--a\nperson who can think. But he DID contradict himself. Ha, ha! Here's a\nquestion you might ask him sometime when he's awake, girl. 'Can God make\na stone so big He couldn't lift it Himself?' Don't forget now. I want to\nhear his opinion on it. I've stumped many a minister with that, girl.\"\n\nFaith was glad to escape him and run home. Dan Reese, standing among the\ncrowd of boys at the gate, looked at her and shaped his mouth into\n\"pig-girl,\" but dared not utter it aloud just there. Next day in school\nwas a different matter. At noon recess Faith encountered Dan in the\nlittle spruce plantation behind the school and Dan shouted once more,\n\n\"Pig-girl! Pig-girl! ROOSTER-GIRL!\"\n\nWalter Blythe suddenly rose from a mossy cushion behind a little clump\nof firs where he had been reading. He was very pale, but his eyes\nblazed.\n\n\"You hold your tongue, Dan Reese!\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, hello, Miss Walter,\" retorted Dan, not at all abashed. He vaulted\nairily to the top of the rail fence and chanted insultingly,\n\n    \"Cowardy, cowardy-custard\n    Stole a pot of mustard,\n    Cowardy, cowardy-custard!\"\n\n\"You are a coincidence!\" said Walter scornfully, turning still whiter.\nHe had only a very hazy idea what a coincidence was, but Dan had none at\nall and thought it must be something peculiarly opprobrious.\n\n\"Yah! Cowardy!\" he yelled gain. \"Your mother writes lies--lies--lies!\nAnd Faith Meredith is a pig-girl--a--pig-girl--a pig-girl! And she's\na rooster-girl--a rooster-girl--a rooster-girl! Yah!\nCowardy--cowardy--cust--\"\n\nDan got no further. Walter had hurled himself across the intervening\nspace and knocked Dan off the fence backward with one well-directed\nblow. Dan's sudden inglorious sprawl was greeted with a burst of\nlaughter and a clapping of hands from Faith. Dan sprang up, purple with\nrage, and began to climb the fence. But just then the school-bell rang\nand Dan knew what happened to boys who were late during Mr. Hazard's\nregime.\n\n\"We'll fight this out,\" he howled. \"Cowardy!\"\n\n\"Any time you like,\" said Walter.\n\n\"Oh, no, no, Walter,\" protested Faith. \"Don't fight him. _I_ don't mind\nwhat he says--I wouldn't condescend to mind the like of HIM.\"\n\n\"He insulted you and he insulted my mother,\" said Walter, with the same\ndeadly calm. \"Tonight after school, Dan.\"\n\n\"I've got to go right home from school to pick taters after the harrows,\ndad says,\" answered Dan sulkily. \"But to-morrow night'll do.\"\n\n\"All right--here to-morrow night,\" agreed Walter.\n\n\"And I'll smash your sissy-face for you,\" promised Dan.\n\nWalter shuddered--not so much from fear of the threat as from repulsion\nover the ugliness and vulgarity of it. But he held his head high and\nmarched into school. Faith followed in a conflict of emotions. She\nhated to think of Walter fighting that little sneak, but oh, he had been\nsplendid! And he was going to fight for HER--Faith Meredith--to punish\nher insulter! Of course he would win--such eyes spelled victory.\n\nFaith's confidence in her champion had dimmed a little by evening,\nhowever. Walter had seemed so very quiet and dull the rest of the day in\nschool.\n\n\"If it were only Jem,\" she sighed to Una, as they sat on Hezekiah\nPollock's tombstone in the graveyard. \"HE is such a fighter--he could\nfinish Dan off in no time. But Walter doesn't know much about fighting.\"\n\n\"I'm so afraid he'll be hurt,\" sighed Una, who hated fighting and\ncouldn't understand the subtle, secret exultation she divined in Faith.\n\n\"He oughtn't to be,\" said Faith uncomfortably. \"He's every bit as big as\nDan.\"\n\n\"But Dan's so much older,\" said Una. \"Why, he's nearly a year older.\"\n\n\"Dan hasn't done much fighting when you come to count up,\" said Faith.\n\"I believe he's really a coward. He didn't think Walter would fight,\nor he wouldn't have called names before him. Oh, if you could just have\nseen Walter's face when he looked at him, Una! It made me shiver--with a\nnice shiver. He looked just like Sir Galahad in that poem father read us\non Saturday.\"\n\n\"I hate the thought of them fighting and I wish it could be stopped,\"\nsaid Una.\n\n\"Oh, it's got to go on now,\" cried Faith. \"It's a matter of honour.\nDon't you DARE tell anyone, Una. If you do I'll never tell you secrets\nagain!\"\n\n\"I won't tell,\" agreed Una. \"But I won't stay to-morrow to watch the\nfight. I'm coming right home.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right. _I_ have to be there--it would be mean not to,\nwhen Walter is fighting for me. I'm going to tie my colours on his\narm--that's the thing to do when he's my knight. How lucky Mrs. Blythe\ngave me that pretty blue hair-ribbon for my birthday! I've only worn it\ntwice so it will be almost new. But I wish I was sure Walter would win.\nIt will be so--so HUMILIATING if he doesn't.\"\n\nFaith would have been yet more dubious if she could have seen her\nchampion just then. Walter had gone home from school with all his\nrighteous anger at a low ebb and a very nasty feeling in its place. He\nhad to fight Dan Reese the next night--and he didn't want to--he hated\nthe thought of it. And he kept thinking of it all the time. Not for a\nminute could he get away from the thought. Would it hurt much? He was\nterribly afraid that it would hurt. And would he be defeated and shamed?\n\nHe could not eat any supper worth speaking of. Susan had made a big\nbatch of his favourite monkey-faces, but he could choke only one down.\nJem ate four. Walter wondered how he could. How could ANYBODY eat? And\nhow could they all talk gaily as they were doing? There was mother, with\nher shining eyes and pink cheeks. SHE didn't know her son had to fight\nnext day. Would she be so gay if she knew, Walter wondered darkly. Jem\nhad taken Susan's picture with his new camera and the result was passed\naround the table and Susan was terribly indignant over it.\n\n\"I am no beauty, Mrs. Dr. dear, and well I know it, and have always\nknown it,\" she said in an aggrieved tone, \"but that I am as ugly as that\npicture makes me out I will never, no, never believe.\"\n\nJem laughed over this and Anne laughed again with him. Walter couldn't\nendure it. He got up and fled to his room.\n\n\"That child has got something on his mind, Mrs. Dr. dear,\" said Susan.\n\"He has et next to nothing. Do you suppose he is plotting another poem?\"\n\nPoor Walter was very far removed in spirit from the starry realms of\npoesy just then. He propped his elbow on his open window-sill and leaned\nhis head drearily on his hands.\n\n\"Come on down to the shore, Walter,\" cried Jem, busting in. \"The boys\nare going to burn the sand-hill grass to-night. Father says we can go.\nCome on.\"\n\nAt any other time Walter would have been delighted. He gloried in the\nburning of the sand-hill grass. But now he flatly refused to go, and no\narguments or entreaties could move him. Disappointed Jem, who did not\ncare for the long dark walk to Four Winds Point alone, retreated to his\nmuseum in the garret and buried himself in a book. He soon forgot his\ndisappointment, revelling with the heroes of old romance, and pausing\noccasionally to picture himself a famous general, leading his troops to\nvictory on some great battlefield.\n\nWalter sat at his window until bedtime. Di crept in, hoping to be told\nwhat was wrong, but Walter could not talk of it, even to Di. Talking\nof it seemed to give it a reality from which he shrank. It was torture\nenough to think of it. The crisp, withered leaves rustled on the maple\ntrees outside his window. The glow of rose and flame had died out of\nthe hollow, silvery sky, and the full moon was rising gloriously over\nRainbow Valley. Afar off, a ruddy woodfire was painting a page of glory\non the horizon beyond the hills. It was a sharp, clear evening when\nfar-away sounds were heard distinctly. A fox was barking across the\npond; an engine was puffing down at the Glen station; a blue-jay was\nscreaming madly in the maple grove; there was laughter over on the manse\nlawn. How could people laugh? How could foxes and blue-jays and engines\nbehave as if nothing were going to happen on the morrow?\n\n\"Oh, I wish it was over,\" groaned Walter.\n\nHe slept very little that night and had hard work choking down his\nporridge in the morning. Susan WAS rather lavish in her platefuls. Mr.\nHazard found him an unsatisfactory pupil that day. Faith Meredith's wits\nseemed to be wool-gathering, too. Dan Reese kept drawing surreptitious\npictures of girls, with pig or rooster heads, on his slate and holding\nthem up for all to see. The news of the coming battle had leaked out\nand most of the boys and many of the girls were in the spruce plantation\nwhen Dan and Walter sought it after school. Una had gone home, but Faith\nwas there, having tied her blue ribbon around Walter's arm. Walter\nwas thankful that neither Jem nor Di nor Nan were among the crowd of\nspectators. Somehow they had not heard of what was in the wind and had\ngone home, too. Walter faced Dan quite undauntedly now. At the last\nmoment all his fear had vanished, but he still felt disgust at the idea\nof fighting. Dan, it was noted, was really paler under his freckles than\nWalter was. One of the older boys gave the word and Dan struck Walter in\nthe face.\n\nWalter reeled a little. The pain of the blow tingled through all his\nsensitive frame for a moment. Then he felt pain no longer. Something,\nsuch as he had never experienced before, seemed to roll over him like\na flood. His face flushed crimson, his eyes burned like flame. The\nscholars of Glen St. Mary school had never dreamed that \"Miss Walter\"\ncould look like that. He hurled himself forward and closed with Dan like\na young wildcat.\n\nThere were no particular rules in the fights of the Glen school boys. It\nwas catch-as-catch can, and get your blows in anyhow. Walter fought with\na savage fury and a joy in the struggle against which Dan could not\nhold his ground. It was all over very speedily. Walter had no clear\nconsciousness of what he was doing until suddenly the red mist cleared\nfrom his sight and he found himself kneeling on the body of the\nprostrate Dan whose nose--oh, horror!--was spouting blood.\n\n\"Have you had enough?\" demanded Walter through his clenched teeth.\n\nDan sulkily admitted that he had.\n\n\"My mother doesn't write lies?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Faith Meredith isn't a pig-girl?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Nor a rooster-girl?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And I'm not a coward?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nWalter had intended to ask, \"And you are a liar?\" but pity intervened\nand he did not humiliate Dan further. Besides, that blood was so\nhorrible.\n\n\"You can go, then,\" he said contemptuously.\n\nThere was a loud clapping from the boys who were perched on the rail\nfence, but some of the girls were crying. They were frightened. They had\nseen schoolboy fights before, but nothing like Walter as he had grappled\nwith Dan. There had been something terrifying about him. They thought he\nwould kill Dan. Now that all was over they sobbed hysterically--except\nFaith, who still stood tense and crimson cheeked.\n\nWalter did not stay for any conqueror's meed. He sprang over the fence\nand rushed down the spruce hill to Rainbow Valley. He felt none of the\nvictor's joy, but he felt a certain calm satisfaction in duty done and\nhonour avenged--mingled with a sickish qualm when he thought of Dan's\ngory nose. It had been so ugly, and Walter hated ugliness.\n\nAlso, he began to realize that he himself was somewhat sore and battered\nup. His lip was cut and swollen and one eye felt very strange. In\nRainbow Valley he encountered Mr. Meredith, who was coming home from an\nafternoon call on the Miss Wests. That reverend gentleman looked gravely\nat him.\n\n\"It seems to me that you have been fighting, Walter?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Walter, expecting a scolding.\n\n\"What was it about?\"\n\n\"Dan Reese said my mother wrote lies and that that Faith was a\npig-girl,\" answered Walter bluntly.\n\n\"Oh--h! Then you were certainly justified, Walter.\"\n\n\"Do you think it's right to fight, sir?\" asked Walter curiously.\n\n\"Not always--and not often--but sometimes--yes, sometimes,\" said John\nMeredith. \"When womenkind are insulted for instance--as in your case. My\nmotto, Walter, is, don't fight till you're sure you ought to, and THEN\nput every ounce of you into it. In spite of sundry discolorations I\ninfer that you came off best.\"\n\n\"Yes. I made him take it all back.\"\n\n\"Very good--very good, indeed. I didn't think you were such a fighter,\nWalter.\"\n\n\"I never fought before--and I didn't want to right up to the last--and\nthen,\" said Walter, determined to make a clean breast of it, \"I liked it\nwhile I was at it.\"\n\nThe Rev. John's eyes twinkled.\n\n\"You were--a little frightened--at first?\"\n\n\"I was a whole lot frightened,\" said honest Walter. \"But I'm not going\nto be frightened any more, sir. Being frightened of things is worse\nthan the things themselves. I'm going to ask father to take me over to\nLowbridge to-morrow to get my tooth out.\"\n\n\"Right again. 'Fear is more pain than is the pain it fears.' Do you know\nwho wrote that, Walter? It was Shakespeare. Was there any feeling or\nemotion or experience of the human heart that that wonderful man did not\nknow? When you go home tell your mother I am proud of you.\"\n\nWalter did not tell her that, however; but he told her all the rest, and\nshe sympathized with him and told him she was glad he had stood up for\nher and Faith, and she anointed his sore spots and rubbed cologne on his\naching head.\n\n\"Are all mothers as nice as you?\" asked Walter, hugging her. \"You're\nWORTH standing up for.\"\n\nMiss Cornelia and Susan were in the living room when Anne came\ndownstairs, and listened to the story with much enjoyment. Susan in\nparticular was highly gratified.\n\n\"I am real glad to hear he has had a good fight, Mrs. Dr. dear. Perhaps\nit may knock that poetry nonsense out of him. And I never, no, never\ncould bear that little viper of a Dan Reese. Will you not sit nearer\nto the fire, Mrs. Marshall Elliott? These November evenings are very\nchilly.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Susan, I'm not cold. I called at the manse before I came\nhere and got quite warm--though I had to go to the kitchen to do it, for\nthere was no fire anywhere else. The kitchen looked as if it had\nbeen stirred up with a stick, believe ME. Mr. Meredith wasn't home. I\ncouldn't find out where he was, but I have an idea that he was up at\nthe Wests'. Do you know, Anne dearie, they say he has been going there\nfrequently all the fall and people are beginning to think he is going to\nsee Rosemary.\"\n\n\"He would get a very charming wife if he married Rosemary,\" said Anne,\npiling driftwood on the fire. \"She is one of the most delightful girls\nI've ever known--truly one of the race of Joseph.\"\n\n\"Ye--s--only she is an Episcopalian,\" said Miss Cornelia doubtfully. \"Of\ncourse, that is better than if she was a Methodist--but I do think Mr.\nMeredith could find a good enough wife in his own denomination. However,\nvery likely there is nothing in it. It's only a month ago that I said to\nhim, 'You ought to marry again, Mr. Meredith.' He looked as shocked as\nif I had suggested something improper. 'My wife is in her grave, Mrs.\nElliott,' he said, in that gentle, saintly way of his. 'I suppose so,'\nI said, 'or I wouldn't be advising you to marry again.' Then he looked\nmore shocked than ever. So I doubt if there is much in this Rosemary\nstory. If a single minister calls twice at a house where there is a\nsingle woman all the gossips have it he is courting her.\"\n\n\"It seems to me--if I may presume to say so--that Mr. Meredith is too\nshy to go courting a second wife,\" said Susan solemnly.\n\n\"He ISN'T shy, believe ME,\" retorted Miss Cornelia.\n\"Absent-minded,--yes--but shy, no. And for all he is so abstracted and\ndreamy he has a very good opinion of himself, man-like, and when he is\nreally awake he wouldn't think it much of a chore to ask any woman to\nhave him. No, the trouble is, he's deluding himself into believing that\nhis heart is buried, while all the time it's beating away inside of him\njust like anybody else's. He may have a notion of Rosemary West and he\nmay not. If he has, we must make the best of it. She is a sweet girl\nand a fine housekeeper, and would make a good mother for those poor,\nneglected children. And,\" concluded Miss Cornelia resignedly, \"my own\ngrandmother was an Episcopalian.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. MARY BRINGS EVIL TIDINGS\n\nMary Vance, whom Mrs. Elliott had sent up to the manse on an errand,\ncame tripping down Rainbow Valley on her way to Ingleside where she was\nto spend the afternoon with Nan and Di as a Saturday treat. Nan and Di\nhad been picking spruce gum with Faith and Una in the manse woods and\nthe four of them were now sitting on a fallen pine by the brook, all,\nit must be admitted, chewing rather vigorously. The Ingleside twins were\nnot allowed to chew spruce gum anywhere but in the seclusion of Rainbow\nValley, but Faith and Una were unrestricted by such rules of etiquette\nand cheerfully chewed it everywhere, at home and abroad, to the very\nproper horror of the Glen. Faith had been chewing it in church one day;\nbut Jerry had realized the enormity of THAT, and had given her such an\nolder-brotherly scolding that she never did it again.\n\n\"I was so hungry I just felt as if I had to chew something,\" she\nprotested. \"You know well enough what breakfast was like, Jerry\nMeredith. I COULDN'T eat scorched porridge and my stomach just felt so\nqueer and empty. The gum helped a lot--and I didn't chew VERY hard. I\ndidn't make any noise and I never cracked the gum once.\"\n\n\"You mustn't chew gum in church, anyhow,\" insisted Jerry. \"Don't let me\ncatch you at it again.\"\n\n\"You chewed yourself in prayer-meeting last week,\" cried Faith.\n\n\"THAT'S different,\" said Jerry loftily. \"Prayer-meeting isn't on Sunday.\nBesides, I sat away at the back in a dark seat and nobody saw me. You\nwere sitting right up front where every one saw you. And I took the gum\nout of my mouth for the last hymn and stuck it on the back of the pew\nright up in front where every one saw you. Then I came away and forgot\nit. I went back to get it next morning, but it was gone. I suppose Rod\nWarren swiped it. And it was a dandy\nchew.\"\n\nMary Vance walked down the Valley with her head held high. She had on\na new blue velvet cap with a scarlet rosette in it, a coat of navy blue\ncloth and a little squirrel-fur muff. She was very conscious of her new\nclothes and very well pleased with herself. Her hair was elaborately\ncrimped, her face was quite plump, her cheeks rosy, her white eyes\nshining. She did not look much like the forlorn and ragged waif the\nMerediths had found in the old Taylor barn. Una tried not to feel\nenvious. Here was Mary with a new velvet cap, but she and Faith had to\nwear their shabby old gray tams again this winter. Nobody ever thought\nof getting them new ones and they were afraid to ask their father for\nthem for fear that he might be short of money and then he would feel\nbadly. Mary had told them once that ministers were always short of\nmoney, and found it \"awful hard\" to make ends meet. Since then Faith and\nUna would have gone in rags rather than ask their father for anything\nif they could help it. They did not worry a great deal over their\nshabbiness; but it was rather trying to see Mary Vance coming out in\nsuch style and putting on such airs about it, too. The new squirrel muff\nwas really the last straw. Neither Faith nor Una had ever had a muff,\ncounting themselves lucky if they could compass mittens without holes in\nthem. Aunt Martha could not see to darn holes and though Una tried to,\nshe made sad cobbling. Somehow, they could not make their greeting of\nMary very cordial. But Mary did not mind or notice that; she was not\noverly sensitive. She vaulted lightly to a seat on the pine tree, and\nlaid the offending muff on a bough. Una saw that it was lined with\nshirred red satin and had red tassels. She looked down at her own rather\npurple, chapped, little hands and wondered if she would ever, EVER be\nable to put them into a muff like that.\n\n\"Give us a chew,\" said Mary companionably. Nan, Di and Faith all\nproduced an amber-hued knot or two from their pockets and passed them to\nMary. Una sat very still. She had four lovely big knots in the pocket of\nher tight, thread-bare little jacket, but she wasn't going to give one\nof them to Mary Vance--not one Let Mary pick her own gum! People with\nsquirrel muffs needn't expect to get everything in the world.\n\n\"Great day, isn't it?\" said Mary, swinging her legs, the better,\nperhaps, to display new boots with very smart cloth tops. Una tucked HER\nfeet under her. There was a hole in the toe of one of her boots and both\nlaces were much knotted. But they were the best she had. Oh, this Mary\nVance! Why hadn't they left her in the old barn?\n\nUna never felt badly because the Ingleside twins were better dressed\nthan she and Faith were. THEY wore their pretty clothes with careless\ngrace and never seemed to think about them at all. Somehow, they did not\nmake other people feel shabby. But when Mary Vance was dressed up she\nseemed fairly to exude clothes--to walk in an atmosphere of clothes--to\nmake everybody else feel and think clothes. Una, as she sat there in the\nhoney-tinted sunshine of the gracious December afternoon, was acutely\nand miserably conscious of everything she had on--the faded tam, which\nwas yet her best, the skimpy jacket she had worn for three winters, the\nholes in her skirt and her boots, the shivering insufficiency of her\npoor little undergarments. Of course, Mary was going out for a visit and\nshe was not. But even if she had been she had nothing better to put on\nand in this lay the sting.\n\n\"Say, this is great gum. Listen to me cracking it. There ain't any gum\nspruces down at Four Winds,\" said Mary. \"Sometimes I just hanker after\na chew. Mrs. Elliott won't let me chew gum if she sees me. She says it\nain't lady-like. This lady-business puzzles me. I can't get on to all\nits kinks. Say, Una, what's the matter with you? Cat got your tongue?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Una, who could not drag her fascinated eyes from that\nsquirrel muff. Mary leaned past her, picked it up and thrust it into\nUna's hands.\n\n\"Stick your paws in that for a while,\" she ordered. \"They look sorter\npinched. Ain't that a dandy muff? Mrs. Elliott give it to me last week\nfor a birthday present. I'm to get the collar at Christmas. I heard her\ntelling Mr. Elliott that.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Elliott is very good to you,\" said Faith.\n\n\"You bet she is. And I'M good to her, too,\" retorted Mary. \"I work like\na nigger to make it easy for her and have everything just as she likes\nit. We was made for each other. 'Tisn't every one could get along with\nher as well as I do. She's pizen neat, but so am I, and so we agree\nfine.\"\n\n\"I told you she would never whip you.\"\n\n\"So you did. She's never tried to lay a finger on me and I ain't never\ntold a lie to her--not one, true's you live. She combs me down with her\ntongue sometimes though, but that just slips off ME like water off a\nduck's back. Say, Una, why didn't you hang on to the muff?\"\n\nUna had put it back on the bough.\n\n\"My hands aren't cold, thank you,\" she said stiffly.\n\n\"Well, if you're satisfied, _I_ am. Say, old Kitty Alec has come back to\nchurch as meek as Moses and nobody knows why. But everybody is saying\nit was Faith brought Norman Douglas out. His housekeeper says you went\nthere and gave him an awful tongue-lashing. Did you?\"\n\n\"I went and asked him to come to church,\" said Faith uncomfortably.\n\n\"Fancy your spunk!\" said Mary admiringly. \"_I_ wouldn't have dared\ndo that and I'm not so slow. Mrs. Wilson says the two of you jawed\nsomething scandalous, but you come off best and then he just turned\nround and like to eat you up. Say, is your father going to preach here\nto-morrow?\"\n\n\"No. He's going to exchange with Mr. Perry from Charlottetown. Father\nwent to town this morning and Mr. Perry is coming out to-night.\"\n\n\"I THOUGHT there was something in the wind, though old Martha wouldn't\ngive me any satisfaction. But I felt sure she wouldn't have been killing\nthat rooster for nothing.\"\n\n\"What rooster? What do you mean?\" cried Faith, turning pale.\n\n\"_I_ don't know what rooster. I didn't see it. When she took the butter\nMrs. Elliott sent up she said she'd been out to the barn killing a\nrooster for dinner tomorrow.\"\n\nFaith sprang down from the pine.\n\n\"It's Adam--we have no other rooster--she has killed Adam.\"\n\n\"Now, don't fly off the handle. Martha said the butcher at the Glen had\nno meat this week and she had to have something and the hens were all\nlaying and too poor.\"\n\n\"If she has killed Adam--\" Faith began to run up the hill.\n\nMary shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"She'll go crazy now. She was so fond of that Adam. He ought to have\nbeen in the pot long ago--he'll be as tough as sole leather. But _I_\nwouldn't like to be in Martha's shoes. Faith's just white with rage;\nUna, you'd better go after her and try to peacify her.\"\n\nMary had gone a few steps with the Blythe girls when Una suddenly turned\nand ran after her.\n\n\"Here's some gum for you, Mary,\" she said, with a little repentant catch\nin her voice, thrusting all her four knots into Mary's hands, \"and I'm\nglad you have such a pretty muff.\"\n\n\"Why, thanks,\" said Mary, rather taken by surprise. To the Blythe girls,\nafter Una had gone, she said, \"Ain't she a queer little mite? But I've\nalways said she had a good heart.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. POOR ADAM!\n\nWhen Una got home Faith was lying face downwards on her bed, utterly\nrefusing to be comforted. Aunt Martha had killed Adam. He was reposing\non a platter in the pantry that very minute, trussed and dressed,\nencircled by his liver and heart and gizzard. Aunt Martha heeded Faith's\npassion of grief and anger not a whit.\n\n\"We had to have something for the strange minister's dinner,\" she said.\n\"You're too big a girl to make such a fuss over an old rooster. You knew\nhe'd have to be killed sometime.\"\n\n\"I'll tell father when he comes home what you've done,\" sobbed Faith.\n\n\"Don't you go bothering your poor father. He has troubles enough. And\nI'M housekeeper here.\"\n\n\"Adam was MINE--Mrs. Johnson gave him to me. You had no business to\ntouch him,\" stormed Faith.\n\n\"Don't you get sassy now. The rooster's killed and there's an end of it.\nI ain't going to set no strange minister down to a dinner of cold b'iled\nmutton. I was brought up to know better than that, if I have come down\nin the world.\"\n\nFaith would not go down to supper that night and she would not go to\nchurch the next morning. But at dinner time she went to the table, her\neyes swollen with crying, her face sullen.\n\nThe Rev. James Perry was a sleek, rubicund man, with a bristling\nwhite moustache, bushy white eyebrows, and a shining bald head. He\nwas certainly not handsome and he was a very tiresome, pompous sort of\nperson. But if he had looked like the Archangel Michael and talked with\nthe tongues of men and angels Faith would still have utterly detested\nhim. He carved Adam up dexterously, showing off his plump white hands\nand very handsome diamond ring. Also, he made jovial remarks all through\nthe performance. Jerry and Carl giggled, and even Una smiled wanly,\nbecause she thought politeness demanded it. But Faith only scowled\ndarkly. The Rev. James thought her manners shockingly bad. Once, when\nhe was delivering himself of an unctuous remark to Jerry, Faith broke in\nrudely with a flat contradiction. The Rev. James drew his bushy eyebrows\ntogether at her.\n\n\"Little girls should not interrupt,\" he said, \"and they should not\ncontradict people who know far more than they do.\"\n\nThis put Faith in a worse temper than ever. To be called \"little girl\"\nas if she were no bigger than chubby Rilla Blythe over at Ingleside!\nIt was insufferable. And how that abominable Mr. Perry did eat! He even\npicked poor Adam's bones. Neither Faith nor Una would touch a mouthful,\nand looked upon the boys as little better than cannibals. Faith felt\nthat if that awful repast did not soon come to an end she would wind it\nup by throwing something at Mr. Perry's gleaming head. Fortunately,\nMr. Perry found Aunt Martha's leathery apple pie too much even for his\npowers of mastication and the meal came to an end, after a long grace in\nwhich Mr. Perry offered up devout thanks for the food which a kind\nand beneficent Providence had provided for sustenance and temperate\npleasure.\n\n\"God hadn't a single thing to do with providing Adam for you,\" muttered\nFaith rebelliously under her breath.\n\nThe boys gladly made their escape to outdoors, Una went to help Aunt\nMartha with the dishes--though that rather grumpy old dame never\nwelcomed her timid assistance--and Faith betook herself to the study\nwhere a cheerful wood fire was burning in the grate. She thought she\nwould thereby escape from the hated Mr. Perry, who had announced his\nintention of taking a nap in his room during the afternoon. But scarcely\nhad Faith settled herself in a corner, with a book, when he walked in\nand, standing before the fire, proceeded to survey the disorderly study\nwith an air of disapproval.\n\n\"You father's books seem to be in somewhat deplorable confusion, my\nlittle girl,\" he said severely.\n\nFaith darkled in her corner and said not a word. She would NOT talk to\nthis--this creature.\n\n\"You should try to put them in order,\" Mr. Perry went on, playing with\nhis handsome watch chain and smiling patronizingly on Faith. \"You are\nquite old enough to attend to such duties. MY little daughter at home\nis only ten and she is already an excellent little housekeeper and the\ngreatest help and comfort to her mother. She is a very sweet child. I\nwish you had the privilege of her acquaintance. She could help you in\nmany ways. Of course, you have not had the inestimable privilege of a\ngood mother's care and training. A sad lack--a very sad lack. I have\nspoken more than once to your father in this connection and pointed out\nhis duty to him faithfully, but so far with no effect. I trust he may\nawaken to a realization of his responsibility before it is too late. In\nthe meantime, it is your duty and privilege to endeavour to take your\nsainted mother's place. You might exercise a great influence over your\nbrothers and your little sister--you might be a true mother to them. I\nfear that you do not think of these things as you should. My dear child,\nallow me to open your eyes in regard to them.\"\n\nMr. Perry's oily, complacent voice trickled on. He was in his element.\nNothing suited him better than to lay down the law, patronize and\nexhort. He had no idea of stopping, and he did not stop. He stood before\nthe fire, his feet planted firmly on the rug, and poured out a flood of\npompous platitudes. Faith heard not a word. She was really not listening\nto him at all. But she was watching his long black coat-tails with\nimpish delight growing in her brown eyes. Mr. Perry was standing VERY\nnear the fire. His coat-tails began to scorch--his coat-tails began\nto smoke. He still prosed on, wrapped up in his own eloquence. The\ncoat-tails smoked worse. A tiny spark flew up from the burning wood and\nalighted in the middle of one. It clung and caught and spread into a\nsmouldering flame. Faith could restrain herself no longer and broke into\na stifled giggle.\n\nMr. Perry stopped short, angered over this impertinence. Suddenly\nhe became conscious that a reek of burning cloth filled the room.\nHe whirled round and saw nothing. Then he clapped his hands to his\ncoat-tails and brought them around in front of him. There was already\nquite a hole in one of them--and this was his new suit. Faith shook with\nhelpless laughter over his pose and expression.\n\n\"Did you see my coat-tails burning?\" he demanded angrily.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Faith demurely.\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me?\" he demanded, glaring at her.\n\n\"You said it wasn't good manners to interrupt, sir,\" said Faith, more\ndemurely still.\n\n\"If--if I was your father, I would give you a spanking that you would\nremember all your life, Miss,\" said a very angry reverend gentleman, as\nhe stalked out of the study. The coat of Mr. Meredith's second best suit\nwould not fit Mr. Perry, so he had to go to the evening service with\nhis singed coat-tail. But he did not walk up the aisle with his usual\nconsciousness of the honour he was conferring on the building. He never\nwould agree to an exchange of pulpits with Mr. Meredith again, and he\nwas barely civil to the latter when they met for a few minutes at the\nstation the next morning. But Faith felt a certain gloomy satisfaction.\nAdam was partially avenged.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. FAITH MAKES A FRIEND\n\nNext day in school was a hard one for Faith. Mary Vance had told the\ntale of Adam, and all the scholars, except the Blythes, thought it quite\na joke. The girls told Faith, between giggles, that it was too bad, and\nthe boys wrote sardonic notes of condolence to her. Poor Faith went home\nfrom school feeling her very soul raw and smarting within her.\n\n\"I'm going over to Ingleside to have a talk with Mrs. Blythe,\" she\nsobbed. \"SHE won't laugh at me, as everybody else does. I've just GOT to\ntalk to somebody who understands how bad I feel.\"\n\nShe ran down through Rainbow Valley. Enchantment had been at work\nthe night before. A light snow had fallen and the powdered firs were\ndreaming of a spring to come and a joy to be. The long hill beyond was\nrichly purple with leafless beeches. The rosy light of sunset lay over\nthe world like a pink kiss. Of all the airy, fairy places, full of\nweird, elfin grace, Rainbow Valley that winter evening was the\nmost beautiful. But all its dreamlike loveliness was lost on poor,\nsore-hearted little Faith.\n\nBy the brook she came suddenly upon Rosemary West, who was sitting on\nthe old pine tree. She was on her way home from Ingleside, where she\nhad been giving the girls their music lesson. She had been lingering in\nRainbow Valley quite a little time, looking across its white beauty and\nroaming some by-ways of dream. Judging from the expression of her face,\nher thoughts were pleasant ones. Perhaps the faint, occasional tinkle\nfrom the bells on the Tree Lovers brought the little lurking smile to\nher lips. Or perhaps it was occasioned by the consciousness that John\nMeredith seldom failed to spend Monday evening in the gray house on the\nwhite wind-swept hill.\n\nInto Rosemary's dreams burst Faith Meredith full of rebellious\nbitterness. Faith stopped abruptly when she saw Miss West. She did not\nknow her very well--just well enough to speak to when they met. And she\ndid not want to see any one just then--except Mrs. Blythe. She knew her\neyes and nose were red and swollen and she hated to have a stranger know\nshe had been crying.\n\n\"Good evening, Miss West,\" she said uncomfortably.\n\n\"What is the matter, Faith?\" asked Rosemary gently.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Faith rather shortly.\n\n\"Oh!\" Rosemary smiled. \"You mean nothing that you can tell to outsiders,\ndon't you?\"\n\nFaith looked at Miss West with sudden interest. Here was a person who\nunderstood things. And how pretty she was! How golden her hair was under\nher plumy hat! How pink her cheeks were over her velvet coat! How blue\nand companionable her eyes were! Faith felt that Miss West could be a\nlovely friend--if only she were a friend instead of a stranger!\n\n\"I--I'm going up to tell Mrs. Blythe,\" said Faith. \"She always\nunderstands--she never laughs at us. I always talk things over with her.\nIt helps.\"\n\n\"Dear girlie, I'm sorry to have to tell you that Mrs. Blythe isn't\nhome,\" said Miss West, sympathetically. \"She went to Avonlea to-day and\nisn't coming back till the last of the week.\"\n\nFaith's lip quivered.\n\n\"Then I might as well go home again,\" she said miserably.\n\n\"I suppose so--unless you think you could bring yourself to talk it over\nwith me instead,\" said Miss Rosemary gently. \"It IS such a help to talk\nthings over. _I_ know. I don't suppose I can be as good at understanding\nas Mrs. Blythe--but I promise you that I won't laugh.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't laugh outside,\" hesitated Faith. \"But you might--inside.\"\n\n\"No, I wouldn't laugh inside, either. Why should I? Something has hurt\nyou--it never amuses me to see anybody hurt, no matter what hurts them.\nIf you feel that you'd like to tell me what has hurt you I'll be glad to\nlisten. But if you think you'd rather not--that's all right, too, dear.\"\n\nFaith took another long, earnest look into Miss West's eyes. They were\nvery serious--there was no laughter in them, not even far, far back.\nWith a little sigh she sat down on the old pine beside her new friend\nand told her all about Adam and his cruel fate.\n\nRosemary did not laugh or feel like laughing. She understood and\nsympathized--really, she was almost as good as Mrs. Blythe--yes, quite\nas good.\n\n\"Mr. Perry is a minister, but he should have been a BUTCHER,\" said Faith\nbitterly. \"He is so fond of carving things up. He ENJOYED cutting\npoor Adam to pieces. He just sliced into him as if he were any common\nrooster.\"\n\n\"Between you and me, Faith, _I_ don't like Mr. Perry very well myself,\"\nsaid Rosemary, laughing a little--but at Mr. Perry, not at Adam, as\nFaith clearly understood. \"I never did like him. I went to school with\nhim--he was a Glen boy, you know--and he was a most detestable little\nprig even then. Oh, how we girls used to hate holding his fat, clammy\nhands in the ring-around games. But we must remember, dear, that he\ndidn't know that Adam had been a pet of yours. He thought he WAS just a\ncommon rooster. We must be just, even when we are terribly hurt.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" admitted Faith. \"But why does everybody seem to think it\nfunny that I should have loved Adam so much, Miss West? If it had been a\nhorrid old cat nobody would have thought it queer. When Lottie Warren's\nkitten had its legs cut off by the binder everybody was sorry for her.\nShe cried two days in school and nobody laughed at her, not even Dan\nReese. And all her chums went to the kitten's funeral and helped her\nbury it--only they couldn't bury its poor little paws with it, because\nthey couldn't find them. It was a horrid thing to have happen, of\ncourse, but I don't think it was as dreadful as seeing your pet EATEN\nUP. Yet everybody laughs at ME.\"\n\n\"I think it is because the name 'rooster' seems rather a funny one,\"\nsaid Rosemary gravely. \"There IS something in it that is comical. Now,\n'chicken' is different. It doesn't sound so funny to talk of loving a\nchicken.\"\n\n\"Adam was the dearest little chicken, Miss West. He was just a little\ngolden ball. He would run up to me and peck out of my hand. And he was\nhandsome when he grew up, too--white as snow, with such a beautiful\ncurving white tail, though Mary Vance said it was too short. He knew\nhis name and always came when I called him--he was a very intelligent\nrooster. And Aunt Martha had no right to kill him. He was mine. It\nwasn't fair, was it, Miss West?\"\n\n\"No, it wasn't,\" said Rosemary decidedly. \"Not a bit fair. I remember\nI had a pet hen when I was a little girl. She was such a pretty little\nthing--all golden brown and speckly. I loved her as much as I ever loved\nany pet. She was never killed--she died of old age. Mother wouldn't have\nher killed because she was my pet.\"\n\n\"If MY mother had been living she wouldn't have let Adam be killed,\"\nsaid Faith. \"For that matter, father wouldn't have either, if he'd been\nhome and known of it. I'm SURE he wouldn't, Miss West.\"\n\n\"I'm sure, too,\" said Rosemary. There was a little added flush on her\nface. She looked rather conscious but Faith noticed nothing.\n\n\"Was it VERY wicked of me not to tell Mr. Perry his coat-tails were\nscorching?\" she asked anxiously.\n\n\"Oh, terribly wicked,\" answered Rosemary, with dancing eyes. \"But _I_\nwould have been just as naughty, Faith--_I_ wouldn't have told him they\nwere scorching--and I don't believe I would ever have been a bit sorry\nfor my wickedness, either.\"\n\n\"Una thought I should have told him because he was a minister.\"\n\n\"Dearest, if a minister doesn't behave as a gentleman we are not bound\nto respect his coat-tails. I know _I_ would just have loved to see Jimmy\nPerry's coat-tails burning up. It must have been fun.\"\n\nBoth laughed; but Faith ended with a bitter little sigh.\n\n\"Well, anyway, Adam is dead and I am NEVER going to love anything\nagain.\"\n\n\"Don't say that, dear. We miss so much out of life if we don't love. The\nmore we love the richer life is--even if it is only some little furry or\nfeathery pet. Would you like a canary, Faith--a little golden bit of a\ncanary? If you would I'll give you one. We have two up home.\"\n\n\"Oh, I WOULD like that,\" cried Faith. \"I love birds. Only--would Aunt\nMartha's cat eat it? It's so TRAGIC to have your pets eaten. I don't\nthink I could endure it a second time.\"\n\n\"If you hang the cage far enough from the wall I don't think the cat\ncould harm it. I'll tell you just how to take care of it and I'll bring\nit to Ingleside for you the next time I come down.\"\n\nTo herself, Rosemary was thinking,\n\n\"It will give every gossip in the Glen something to talk of, but I WILL\nnot care. I want to comfort this poor little heart.\"\n\nFaith was comforted. Sympathy and understanding were very sweet. She and\nMiss Rosemary sat on the old pine until the twilight crept softly down\nover the white valley and the evening star shone over the gray maple\ngrove. Faith told Rosemary all her small history and hopes, her likes\nand dislikes, the ins and outs of life at the manse, the ups and downs\nof school society. Finally they parted firm friends.\n\nMr. Meredith was, as usual, lost in dreams when supper began that\nevening, but presently a name pierced his abstraction and brought him\nback to reality. Faith was telling Una of her meeting with Rosemary.\n\n\"She is just lovely, I think,\" said Faith. \"Just as nice as Mrs.\nBlythe--but different. I felt as if I wanted to hug her. She did hug\nME--such a nice, velvety hug. And she called me 'dearest.' It THRILLED\nme. I could tell her ANYTHING.\"\n\n\"So you liked Miss West, Faith?\" Mr. Meredith asked, with a rather odd\nintonation.\n\n\"I love her,\" cried Faith.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Meredith. \"Ah!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. THE IMPOSSIBLE WORD\n\nJohn Meredith walked meditatively through the clear crispness of a\nwinter night in Rainbow Valley. The hills beyond glistened with the\nchill splendid lustre of moonlight on snow. Every little fir tree in the\nlong valley sang its own wild song to the harp of wind and frost. His\nchildren and the Blythe lads and lasses were coasting down the eastern\nslope and whizzing over the glassy pond. They were having a glorious\ntime and their gay voices and gayer laughter echoed up and down the\nvalley, dying away in elfin cadences among the trees. On the right the\nlights of Ingleside gleamed through the maple grove with the genial lure\nand invitation which seems always to glow in the beacons of a home where\nwe know there is love and good-cheer and a welcome for all kin, whether\nof flesh or spirit. Mr. Meredith liked very well on occasion to spend an\nevening arguing with the doctor by the drift wood fire, where the famous\nchina dogs of Ingleside kept ceaseless watch and ward, as became deities\nof the hearth, but to-night he did not look that way. Far on the western\nhill gleamed a paler but more alluring star. Mr. Meredith was on his way\nto see Rosemary West, and he meant to tell her something which had been\nslowly blossoming in his heart since their first meeting and had sprung\ninto full flower on the evening when Faith had so warmly voiced her\nadmiration for Rosemary.\n\nHe had come to realize that he had learned to care for Rosemary. Not as\nhe had cared for Cecilia, of course. THAT was entirely different. That\nlove of romance and dream and glamour could never, he thought, return.\nBut Rosemary was beautiful and sweet and dear--very dear. She was the\nbest of companions. He was happier in her company than he had ever\nexpected to be again. She would be an ideal mistress for his home, a\ngood mother to his children.\n\nDuring the years of his widowhood Mr. Meredith had received innumerable\nhints from brother members of Presbytery and from many parishioners who\ncould not be suspected of any ulterior motive, as well as from some\nwho could, that he ought to marry again: But these hints never made any\nimpression on him. It was commonly thought he was never aware of them.\nBut he was quite acutely aware of them. And in his own occasional\nvisitations of common sense he knew that the common sensible thing for\nhim to do was to marry. But common sense was not the strong point of\nJohn Meredith, and to choose out, deliberately and cold-bloodedly,\nsome \"suitable\" woman, as one might choose a housekeeper or a business\npartner, was something he was quite incapable of doing. How he hated\nthat word \"suitable.\" It reminded him so strongly of James Perry. \"A\nSUIT able woman of SUIT able age,\" that unctuous brother of the cloth\nhad said, in his far from subtle hint. For the moment John Meredith\nhad had a perfectly unbelievable desire to rush madly away and propose\nmarriage to the youngest, most unsuitable woman it was possible to\ndiscover.\n\nMrs. Marshall Elliott was his good friend and he liked her. But when she\nhad bluntly told him he should marry again he felt as if she had torn\naway the veil that hung before some sacred shrine of his innermost life,\nand he had been more or less afraid of her ever since. He knew there\nwere women in his congregation \"of suitable age\" who would marry him\nquite readily. That fact had seeped through all his abstraction very\nearly in his ministry in Glen St. Mary. They were good, substantial,\nuninteresting women, one or two fairly comely, the others not exactly so\nand John Meredith would as soon have thought of marrying any one of them\nas of hanging himself. He had some ideals to which no seeming necessity\ncould make him false. He could ask no woman to fill Cecilia's place in\nhis home unless he could offer her at least some of the affection and\nhomage he had given to his girlish bride. And where, in his limited\nfeminine acquaintance, was such a woman to be found?\n\nRosemary West had come into his life on that autumn evening bringing\nwith her an atmosphere in which his spirit recognized native air. Across\nthe gulf of strangerhood they clasped hands of friendship. He knew her\nbetter in that ten minutes by the hidden spring than he knew Emmeline\nDrew or Elizabeth Kirk or Amy Annetta Douglas in a year, or could know\nthem, in a century. He had fled to her for comfort when Mrs. Alec Davis\nhad outraged his mind and soul and had found it. Since then he had gone\noften to the house on the hill, slipping through the shadowy paths of\nnight in Rainbow Valley so astutely that Glen gossip could never be\nabsolutely certain that he DID go to see Rosemary West. Once or twice he\nhad been caught in the West living room by other visitors; that was all\nthe Ladies' Aid had to go by. But when Elizabeth Kirk heard it she put\naway a secret hope she had allowed herself to cherish, without a change\nof expression on her kind plain face, and Emmeline Drew resolved that\nthe next time she saw a certain old bachelor of Lowbridge she would not\nsnub him as she had done at a previous meeting. Of course, if Rosemary\nWest was out to catch the minister she would catch him; she looked\nyounger than she was and MEN thought her pretty; besides, the West girls\nhad money!\n\n\"It is to be hoped that he won't be so absent-minded as to propose to\nEllen by mistake,\" was the only malicious thing she allowed herself\nto say to a sympathetic sister Drew. Emmeline bore no further grudge\ntowards Rosemary. When all was said and done, an unencumbered bachelor\nwas far better than a widower with four children. It had been only the\nglamour of the manse that had temporarily blinded Emmeline's eyes to the\nbetter part.\n\nA sled with three shrieking occupants sped past Mr. Meredith to the\npond. Faith's long curls streamed in the wind and her laughter rang\nabove that of the others. John Meredith looked after them kindly\nand longingly. He was glad that his children had such chums as the\nBlythes--glad that they had so wise and gay and tender a friend as Mrs.\nBlythe. But they needed something more, and that something would be\nsupplied when he brought Rosemary West as a bride to the old manse.\nThere was in her a quality essentially maternal.\n\nIt was Saturday night and he did not often go calling on Saturday night,\nwhich was supposed to be dedicated to a thoughtful revision of Sunday's\nsermon. But he had chosen this night because he had learned that Ellen\nWest was going to be away and Rosemary would be alone. Often as he had\nspent pleasant evenings in the house on the hill he had never, since\nthat first meeting at the spring, seen Rosemary alone. Ellen had always\nbeen there.\n\nHe did not precisely object to Ellen being there. He liked Ellen\nWest very much and they were the best of friends. Ellen had an almost\nmasculine understanding and a sense of humour which his own shy, hidden\nappreciation of fun found very agreeable. He liked her interest in\npolitics and world events. There was no man in the Glen, not even\nexcepting Dr. Blythe, who had a better grasp of such things.\n\n\"I think it is just as well to be interested in things as long as you\nlive,\" she had said. \"If you're not, it doesn't seem to me that there's\nmuch difference between the quick and the dead.\"\n\nHe liked her pleasant, deep, rumbly voice; he liked the hearty laugh\nwith which she always ended up some jolly and well-told story. She never\ngave him digs about his children as other Glen women did; she never\nbored him with local gossip; she had no malice and no pettiness. She\nwas always splendidly sincere. Mr. Meredith, who had picked up Miss\nCornelia's way of classifying people, considered that Ellen belonged to\nthe race of Joseph. Altogether, an admirable woman for a sister-in-law.\nNevertheless, a man did not want even the most admirable of women around\nwhen he was proposing to another woman. And Ellen was always around. She\ndid not insist on talking to Mr. Meredith herself all the time. She let\nRosemary have a fair share of him. Many evenings, indeed, Ellen effaced\nherself almost totally, sitting back in the corner with St. George in\nher lap, and letting Mr. Meredith and Rosemary talk and sing and read\nbooks together. Sometimes they quite forgot her presence. But if their\nconversation or choice of duets ever betrayed the least tendency to what\nEllen considered philandering, Ellen promptly nipped that tendency in\nthe bud and blotted Rosemary out for the rest of the evening. But not\neven the grimmest of amiable dragons can altogether prevent a certain\nsubtle language of eye and smile and eloquent silence; and so the\nminister's courtship progressed after a fashion.\n\nBut if it was ever to reach a climax that climax must come when Ellen\nwas away. And Ellen was so seldom away, especially in winter. She found\nher own fireside the pleasantest place in the world, she vowed. Gadding\nhad no attraction for her. She was fond of company but she wanted it at\nhome. Mr. Meredith had almost been driven to the conclusion that he must\nwrite to Rosemary what he wanted to say, when Ellen casually announced\none evening that she was going to a silver wedding next Saturday night.\nShe had been bridesmaid when the principals were married. Only old\nguests were invited, so Rosemary was not included. Mr. Meredith pricked\nup his ears a trifle and a gleam flashed into his dreamy dark eyes.\nBoth Ellen and Rosemary saw it; and both Ellen and Rosemary felt, with a\ntingling shock, that Mr. Meredith would certainly come up the hill next\nSaturday night.\n\n\"Might as well have it over with, St. George,\" Ellen sternly told the\nblack cat, after Mr. Meredith had gone home and Rosemary had silently\ngone upstairs. \"He means to ask her, St. George--I'm perfectly sure of\nthat. So he might as well have his chance to do it and find out he can't\nget her, George. She'd rather like to take him, Saint. I know that--but\nshe promised, and she's got to keep her promise. I'm rather sorry in\nsome ways, St. George. I don't know of a man I'd sooner have for a\nbrother-in-law if a brother-in-law was convenient. I haven't a thing\nagainst him, Saint--not a thing except that he won't see and can't be\nmade to see that the Kaiser is a menace to the peace of Europe. That's\nHIS blind spot. But he's good company and I like him. A woman can say\nanything she likes to a man with a mouth like John Meredith's and\nbe sure of not being misunderstood. Such a man is more precious than\nrubies, Saint--and much rarer, George. But he can't have Rosemary--and\nI suppose when he finds out he can't have her he'll drop us both. And\nwe'll miss him, Saint--we'll miss him something scandalous, George. But\nshe promised, and I'll see that she keeps her promise!\"\n\nEllen's face looked almost ugly in its lowering resolution. Upstairs\nRosemary was crying into her pillow.\n\nSo Mr. Meredith found his lady alone and looking very beautiful.\nRosemary had not made any special toilet for the occasion; she wanted\nto, but she thought it would be absurd to dress up for a man you meant\nto refuse. So she wore her plain dark afternoon dress and looked like a\nqueen in it. Her suppressed excitement coloured her face to brilliancy,\nher great blue eyes were pools of light less placid than usual.\n\nShe wished the interview were over. She had looked forward to it all day\nwith dread. She felt quite sure that John Meredith cared a great deal\nfor her after a fashion--and she felt just as sure that he did not care\nfor her as he had cared for his first love. She felt that her refusal\nwould disappoint him considerably, but she did not think it would\naltogether overwhelm him. Yet she hated to make it; hated for his sake\nand--Rosemary was quite honest with herself--for her own. She knew she\ncould have loved John Meredith if--if it had been permissible. She\nknew that life would be a blank thing if, rejected as lover, he refused\nlonger to be a friend. She knew that she could be very happy with him\nand that she could make him happy. But between her and happiness stood\nthe prison gate of the promise she had made to Ellen years ago. Rosemary\ncould not remember her father. He had died when she was only three years\nold. Ellen, who had been thirteen, remembered him, but with no special\ntenderness. He had been a stern, reserved man many years older than his\nfair, pretty wife. Five years later their brother of twelve died also;\nsince his death the two girls had always lived alone with their mother.\nThey had never mingled very freely in the social life of the Glen or\nLowbridge, though where they went the wit and spirit of Ellen and the\nsweetness and beauty of Rosemary made them welcome guests. Both had what\nwas called \"a disappointment\" in their girlhood. The sea had not given\nup Rosemary's lover; and Norman Douglas, then a handsome, red-haired\nyoung giant, noted for wild driving and noisy though harmless escapades,\nhad quarrelled with Ellen and left her in a fit of pique.\n\nThere were not lacking candidates for both Martin's and Norman's places,\nbut none seemed to find favour in the eyes of the West girls, who\ndrifted slowly out of youth and bellehood without any seeming regret.\nThey were devoted to their mother, who was a chronic invalid. The three\nhad a little circle of home interests--books and pets and flowers--which\nmade them happy and contented.\n\nMrs. West's death, which occurred on Rosemary's twenty-fifth birthday,\nwas a bitter grief to them. At first they were intolerably lonely.\nEllen, especially, continued to grieve and brood, her long, moody\nmusings broken only by fits of stormy, passionate weeping. The old\nLowbridge doctor told Rosemary that he feared permanent melancholy or\nworse.\n\nOnce, when Ellen had sat all day, refusing either to speak or eat,\nRosemary had flung herself on her knees by her sister's side.\n\n\"Oh, Ellen, you have me yet,\" she said imploringly. \"Am I nothing to\nyou? We have always loved each other so.\"\n\n\"I won't have you always,\" Ellen had said, breaking her silence with\nharsh intensity. \"You will marry and leave me. I shall be left all\nalone. I cannot bear the thought--I CANNOT. I would rather die.\"\n\n\"I will never marry,\" said Rosemary, \"never, Ellen.\"\n\nEllen bent forward and looked searchingly into Rosemary's eyes.\n\n\"Will you promise me that solemnly?\" she said. \"Promise it on mother's\nBible.\"\n\nRosemary assented at once, quite willing to humour Ellen. What did it\nmatter? She knew quite well she would never want to marry any one. Her\nlove had gone down with Martin Crawford to the deeps of the sea; and\nwithout love she could not marry any one. So she promised readily,\nthough Ellen made rather a fearsome rite of it. They clasped hands over\nthe Bible, in their mother's vacant room, and both vowed to each other\nthat they would never marry and would always live together.\n\nEllen's condition improved from that hour. She soon regained her normal\ncheery poise. For ten years she and Rosemary lived in the old house\nhappily, undisturbed by any thought of marrying or giving in marriage.\nTheir promise sat very lightly on them. Ellen never failed to remind her\nsister of it whenever any eligible male creature crossed their paths,\nbut she had never been really alarmed until John Meredith came home that\nnight with Rosemary. As for Rosemary, Ellen's obsession regarding that\npromise had always been a little matter of mirth to her--until lately.\nNow, it was a merciless fetter, self-imposed but never to be shaken off.\nBecause of it to-night she must turn her face from happiness.\n\nIt was true that the shy, sweet, rosebud love she had given to her\nboy-lover she could never give to another. But she knew now that she\ncould give to John Meredith a love richer and more womanly. She knew\nthat he touched deeps in her nature that Martin had never touched--that\nhad not, perhaps, been in the girl of seventeen to touch. And she must\nsend him away to-night--send him back to his lonely hearth and his empty\nlife and his heart-breaking problems, because she had promised Ellen,\nten years before, on their mother's Bible, that she would never marry.\n\nJohn Meredith did not immediately grasp his opportunity. On the\ncontrary, he talked for two good hours on the least lover-like of\nsubjects. He even tried politics, though politics always bored Rosemary.\nThe later began to think that she had been altogether mistaken, and her\nfears and expectations suddenly seemed to her grotesque. She felt flat\nand foolish. The glow went out of her face and the lustre out of her\neyes. John Meredith had not the slightest intention of asking her to\nmarry him.\n\nAnd then, quite suddenly, he rose, came across the room, and standing\nby her chair, he asked it. The room had grown terribly still. Even St.\nGeorge ceased to purr. Rosemary heard her own heart beating and was sure\nJohn Meredith must hear it too.\n\nNow was the time for her to say no, gently but firmly. She had been\nready for days with her stilted, regretful little formula. And now\nthe words of it had completely vanished from her mind. She had to say\nno--and she suddenly found she could not say it. It was the impossible\nword. She knew now that it was not that she COULD have loved John\nMeredith, but that she DID love him. The thought of putting him from her\nlife was agony.\n\nShe must say SOMETHING; she lifted her bowed golden head and asked him\nstammeringly to give her a few days for--for consideration.\n\nJohn Meredith was a little surprised. He was not vainer than any man has\na right to be, but he had expected that Rosemary West would say yes.\nHe had been tolerably sure she cared for him. Then why this doubt--this\nhesitation? She was not a school girl to be uncertain as to her own\nmind. He felt an ugly shock of disappointment and dismay. But he\nassented to her request with his unfailing gentle courtesy and went away\nat once.\n\n\"I will tell you in a few days,\" said Rosemary, with downcast eyes and\nburning face.\n\nWhen the door shut behind him she went back into the room and wrung her\nhands.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. ST. GEORGE KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT\n\nAt midnight Ellen West was walking home from the Pollock silver wedding.\nShe had stayed a little while after the other guests had gone, to help\nthe gray-haired bride wash the dishes. The distance between the two\nhouses was not far and the road good, so that Ellen was enjoying the\nwalk back home in the moonlight.\n\nThe evening had been a pleasant one. Ellen, who had not been to a party\nfor years, found it very pleasant. All the guests had been members of\nher old set and there was no intrusive youth to spoil the flavour, for\nthe only son of the bride and groom was far away at college and could\nnot be present. Norman Douglas had been there and they had met socially\nfor the first time in years, though she had seen him once or twice in\nchurch that winter. Not the least sentiment was awakened in Ellen's\nheart by their meeting. She was accustomed to wonder, when she thought\nabout it at all, how she could ever have fancied him or felt so badly\nover his sudden marriage. But she had rather liked meeting him again.\nShe had forgotten how bracing and stimulating he could be. No gathering\nwas ever stagnant when Norman Douglas was present. Everybody had been\nsurprised when Norman came. It was well known he never went anywhere.\nThe Pollocks had invited him because he had been one of the original\nguests, but they never thought he would come. He had taken his second\ncousin, Amy Annetta Douglas, out to supper and seemed rather attentive\nto her. But Ellen sat across the table from him and had a spirited\nargument with him--an argument during which all his shouting and banter\ncould not fluster her and in which she came off best, flooring Norman so\ncomposedly and so completely that he was silent for ten minutes. At\nthe end of which time he had muttered in his ruddy beard--\"spunky as\never--spunky as ever\"--and began to hector Amy Annetta, who giggled\nfoolishly over his sallies where Ellen would have retorted bitingly.\n\nEllen thought these things over as she walked home, tasting them with\nreminiscent relish. The moonlit air sparkled with frost. The snow\ncrisped under her feet. Below her lay the Glen with the white harbour\nbeyond. There was a light in the manse study. So John Meredith had gone\nhome. Had he asked Rosemary to marry him? And after what fashion had\nshe made her refusal known? Ellen felt that she would never know this,\nthough she was quite curious. She was sure Rosemary would never tell\nher anything about it and she would not dare to ask. She must just be\ncontent with the fact of the refusal. After all, that was the only thing\nthat really mattered.\n\n\"I hope he'll have sense enough to come back once in a while and be\nfriendly,\" she said to herself. She disliked so much to be alone that\nthinking aloud was one of her devices for circumventing unwelcome\nsolitude. \"It's awful never to have a man-body with some brains to talk\nto once in a while. And like as not he'll never come near the house\nagain. There's Norman Douglas, too--I like that man, and I'd like to\nhave a good rousing argument with him now and then. But he'd never dare\ncome up for fear people would think he was courting me again--for fear\nI'D think it, too, most likely--though he's more a stranger to me now\nthan John Meredith. It seems like a dream that we could ever have been\nbeaus. But there it is--there's only two men in the Glen I'd ever want\nto talk to--and what with gossip and this wretched love-making business\nit's not likely I'll ever see either of them again. I could,\" said\nEllen, addressing the unmoved stars with a spiteful emphasis, \"I could\nhave made a better world myself.\"\n\nShe paused at her gate with a sudden vague feeling of alarm. There was\nstill a light in the living-room and to and fro across the window-shades\nwent the shadow of a woman walking restlessly up and down. What was\nRosemary doing up at this hour of the night? And why was she striding\nabout like a lunatic?\n\nEllen went softly in. As she opened the hall door Rosemary came out of\nthe room. She was flushed and breathless. An atmosphere of stress and\npassion hung about her like a garment.\n\n\"Why aren't you in bed, Rosemary?\" demanded Ellen.\n\n\"Come in here,\" said Rosemary intensely. \"I want to tell you something.\"\n\nEllen composedly removed her wraps and overshoes, and followed her\nsister into the warm, fire-lighted room. She stood with her hand on\nthe table and waited. She was looking very handsome herself, in her own\ngrim, black-browed style. The new black velvet dress, with its train and\nV-neck, which she had made purposely for the party, became her stately,\nmassive figure. She wore coiled around her neck the rich heavy necklace\nof amber beads which was a family heirloom. Her walk in the frosty air\nhad stung her cheeks into a glowing scarlet. But her steel-blue eyes\nwere as icy and unyielding as the sky of the winter night. She stood\nwaiting in a silence which Rosemary could break only by a convulsive\neffort.\n\n\"Ellen, Mr. Meredith was here this evening.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"And--and--he asked me to marry him.\"\n\n\"So I expected. Of course, you refused him?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Rosemary.\" Ellen clenched her hands and took an involuntary step\nforward. \"Do you mean to tell me that you accepted him?\"\n\n\"No--no.\"\n\nEllen recovered her self-command.\n\n\"What DID you do then?\"\n\n\"I--I asked him to give me a few days to think it over.\"\n\n\"I hardly see why that was necessary,\" said Ellen, coldly contemptuous,\n\"when there is only the one answer you can make him.\"\n\nRosemary held out her hands beseechingly.\n\n\"Ellen,\" she said desperately, \"I love John Meredith--I want to be his\nwife. Will you set me free from that promise?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Ellen, merciless, because she was sick from fear.\n\n\"Ellen--Ellen--\"\n\n\"Listen,\" interrupted Ellen. \"I did not ask you for that promise. You\noffered it.\"\n\n\"I know--I know. But I did not think then that I could ever care for\nanyone again.\"\n\n\"You offered it,\" went on Ellen unmovably. \"You promised it over our\nmother's Bible. It was more than a promise--it was an oath. Now you want\nto break it.\"\n\n\"I only asked you to set me free from it, Ellen.\"\n\n\"I will not do it. A promise is a promise in my eyes. I will not do it.\nBreak your promise--be forsworn if you will--but it shall not be with\nany assent of mine.\"\n\n\"You are very hard on me, Ellen.\"\n\n\"Hard on you! And what of me? Have you ever given a thought to what my\nloneliness would be here if you left me? I could not bear it--I would go\ncrazy. I CANNOT live alone. Haven't I been a good sister to you? Have I\never opposed any wish of yours? Haven't I indulged you in everything?\"\n\n\"Yes--yes.\"\n\n\"Then why do you want to leave me for this man whom you hadn't seen a\nyear ago?\"\n\n\"I love him, Ellen.\"\n\n\"Love! You talk like a school miss instead of a middle-aged woman. He\ndoesn't love you. He wants a housekeeper and a governess. You don't love\nhim. You want to be 'Mrs.'--you are one of those weak-minded women who\nthink it's a disgrace to be ranked as an old maid. That's all there is\nto it.\"\n\nRosemary quivered. Ellen could not, or would not, understand. There was\nno use arguing with her.\n\n\"So you won't release me, Ellen?\"\n\n\"No, I won't. And I won't talk of it again. You promised and you've got\nto keep your word. That's all. Go to bed. Look at the time! You're all\nromantic and worked up. To-morrow you'll be more sensible. At any rate,\ndon't let me hear any more of this nonsense. Go.\"\n\nRosemary went without another word, pale and spiritless. Ellen walked\nstormily about the room for a few minutes, then paused before the chair\nwhere St. George had been calmly sleeping through the whole evening. A\nreluctant smile overspread her dark face. There had been only one time\nin her life--the time of her mother's death--when Ellen had not been\nable to temper tragedy with comedy. Even in that long ago bitterness,\nwhen Norman Douglas had, after a fashion, jilted her, she had laughed at\nherself quite as often as she had cried.\n\n\"I expect there'll be some sulking, St. George. Yes, Saint, I expect\nwe are in for a few unpleasant foggy days. Well, we'll weather them\nthrough, George. We've dealt with foolish children before, Saint.\nRosemary'll sulk a while--and then she'll get over it--and all will be\nas before, George. She promised--and she's got to keep her promise. And\nthat's the last word on the subject I'll say to you or her or anyone,\nSaint.\"\n\nBut Ellen lay savagely awake till morning.\n\nThere was no sulking, however. Rosemary was pale and quiet the next day,\nbut beyond that Ellen could detect no difference in her. Certainly, she\nseemed to bear Ellen no grudge. It was stormy, so no mention was made of\ngoing to church. In the afternoon Rosemary shut herself in her room and\nwrote a note to John Meredith. She could not trust herself to say \"no\"\nin person. She felt quite sure that if he suspected she was saying \"no\"\nreluctantly he would not take it for an answer, and she could not face\npleading or entreaty. She must make him think she cared nothing at\nall for him and she could do that only by letter. She wrote him the\nstiffest, coolest little refusal imaginable. It was barely courteous;\nit certainly left no loophole of hope for the boldest lover--and\nJohn Meredith was anything but that. He shrank into himself, hurt and\nmortified, when he read Rosemary's letter next day in his dusty study.\nBut under his mortification a dreadful realization presently made itself\nfelt. He had thought he did not love Rosemary as deeply as he had\nloved Cecilia. Now, when he had lost her, he knew that he did. She\nwas everything to him--everything! And he must put her out of his life\ncompletely. Even friendship was impossible now. Life stretched before\nhim in intolerable dreariness. He must go on--there was his work--his\nchildren--but the heart had gone out of him. He sat alone all that\nevening in his dark, cold, comfortless study with his head bowed on his\nhands. Up on the hill Rosemary had a headache and went early to bed,\nwhile Ellen remarked to St. George, purring his disdain of foolish\nhumankind, who did not know that a soft cushion was the only thing that\nreally mattered,\n\n\"What would women do if headaches had never been invented, St. George?\nBut never mind, Saint. We'll just wink the other eye for a few weeks.\nI admit I don't feel comfortable myself, George. I feel as if I had\ndrowned a kitten. But she promised, Saint--and she was the one to offer\nit, George. Bismillah!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. THE GOOD-CONDUCT CLUB\n\nA light rain had been falling all day--a little, delicate, beautiful\nspring rain, that somehow seemed to hint and whisper of mayflowers\nand wakening violets. The harbour and the gulf and the low-lying shore\nfields had been dim with pearl-gray mists. But now in the evening the\nrain had ceased and the mists had blown out to sea. Clouds sprinkled the\nsky over the harbour like little fiery roses. Beyond it the hills were\ndark against a spendthrift splendour of daffodil and crimson. A great\nsilvery evening star was watching over the bar. A brisk, dancing,\nnew-sprung wind was blowing up from Rainbow Valley, resinous with the\nodours of fir and damp mosses. It crooned in the old spruces around\nthe graveyard and ruffled Faith's splendid curls as she sat on Hezekiah\nPollock's tombstone with her arms round Mary Vance and Una. Carl and\nJerry were sitting opposite them on another tombstone and all were\nrather full of mischief after being cooped up all day.\n\n\"The air just SHINES to-night, doesn't it? It's been washed so clean,\nyou see,\" said Faith happily.\n\nMary Vance eyed her gloomily. Knowing what she knew, or fancied she\nknew, Mary considered that Faith was far too light-hearted. Mary had\nsomething on her mind to say and she meant to say it before she went\nhome. Mrs. Elliott had sent her up to the manse with some new-laid eggs,\nand had told her not to stay longer than half an hour. The half hour\nwas nearly up, so Mary uncurled her cramped legs from under her and said\nabruptly,\n\n\"Never mind about the air. Just you listen to me. You manse young ones\nhave just got to behave yourselves better than you've been doing this\nspring--that's all there is to it. I just come up to-night a-purpose to\ntell you so. The way people are talking about you is awful.\"\n\n\"What have we been doing now?\" cried Faith in amazement, pulling her arm\naway from Mary. Una's lips trembled and her sensitive little soul shrank\nwithin her. Mary was always so brutally frank. Jerry began to whistle\nout of bravado. He meant to let Mary see he didn't care for HER tirades.\nTheir behaviour was no business of HERS anyway. What right had SHE to\nlecture them on their conduct?\n\n\"Doing now! You're doing ALL the time,\" retorted Mary. \"Just as soon\nas the talk about one of your didos fades away you do something else\nto start it up again. It seems to me you haven't any idea of how manse\nchildren ought to behave!\"\n\n\"Maybe YOU can tell us,\" said Jerry, killingly sarcastic.\n\nSarcasm was quite thrown away on Mary.\n\n\"_I_ can tell you what will happen if you don't learn to behave\nyourselves. The session will ask your father to resign. There now,\nMaster Jerry-know-it-all. Mrs. Alec Davis said so to Mrs. Elliott. I\nheard her. I always have my ears pricked up when Mrs. Alec Davis comes\nto tea. She said you were all going from bad to worse and that though\nit was only what was to be expected when you had nobody to bring you\nup, still the congregation couldn't be expected to put up with it much\nlonger, and something would have to be done. The Methodists just laugh\nand laugh at you, and that hurts the Presbyterian feelings. SHE says you\nall need a good dose of birch tonic. Lor', if that would make folks good\n_I_ oughter be a young saint. I'm not telling you this because I want\nto hurt YOUR feelings. I'm sorry for you\"--Mary was past mistress of\nthe gentle art of condescension. \"_I_ understand that you haven't\nmuch chance, the way things are. But other people don't make as much\nallowance as _I_ do. Miss Drew says Carl had a frog in his pocket in\nSunday School last Sunday and it hopped out while she was hearing the\nlesson. She says she's going to give up the class. Why don't you keep\nyour insecks home?\"\n\n\"I popped it right back in again,\" said Carl. \"It didn't hurt anybody--a\npoor little frog! And I wish old Jane Drew WOULD give up our class. I\nhate her. Her own nephew had a dirty plug of tobacco in his pocket and\noffered us fellows a chew when Elder Clow was praying. I guess that's\nworse than a frog.\"\n\n\"No, 'cause frogs are more unexpected-like. They make more of a\nsensation. 'Sides, he wasn't caught at it. And then that praying\ncompetition you had last week has made a fearful scandal. Everybody is\ntalking about it.\"\n\n\"Why, the Blythes were in that as well as us,\" cried Faith, indignantly.\n\"It was Nan Blythe who suggested it in the first place. And Walter took\nthe prize.\"\n\n\"Well, you get the credit of it any way. It wouldn't have been so bad if\nyou hadn't had it in the graveyard.\"\n\n\"I should think a graveyard was a very good place to pray in,\" retorted\nJerry.\n\n\"Deacon Hazard drove past when YOU were praying,\" said Mary, \"and he saw\nand heard you, with your hands folded over your stomach, and groaning\nafter every sentence. He thought you were making fun of HIM.\"\n\n\"So I was,\" declared unabashed Jerry. \"Only I didn't know he was going\nby, of course. That was just a mean accident. _I_ wasn't praying in\nreal earnest--I knew I had no chance of winning the prize. So I was just\ngetting what fun I could out of it. Walter Blythe can pray bully. Why,\nhe can pray as well as dad.\"\n\n\"Una is the only one of US who really likes praying,\" said Faith\npensively.\n\n\"Well, if praying scandalizes people so much we mustn't do it any more,\"\nsighed Una.\n\n\"Shucks, you can pray all you want to, only not in the graveyard--and\ndon't make a game of it. That was what made it so bad--that, and having\na tea-party on the tombstones.\"\n\n\"We hadn't.\"\n\n\"Well, a soap-bubble party then. You had SOMETHING. The over-harbour\npeople swear you had a tea-party, but I'm willing to take your word. And\nyou used this tombstone as a table.\"\n\n\"Well, Martha wouldn't let us blow bubbles in the house. She was awful\ncross that day,\" explained Jerry. \"And this old slab made such a jolly\ntable.\"\n\n\"Weren't they pretty?\" cried Faith, her eyes sparkling over the\nremembrance. \"They reflected the trees and the hills and the harbour\nlike little fairy worlds, and when we shook them loose they floated away\ndown to Rainbow Valley.\"\n\n\"All but one and it went over and bust up on the Methodist spire,\" said\nCarl.\n\n\"I'm glad we did it once, anyhow, before we found out it was wrong,\"\nsaid Faith.\n\n\"It wouldn't have been wrong to blow them on the lawn,\" said Mary\nimpatiently. \"Seems like I can't knock any sense into your heads.\nYou've been told often enough you shouldn't play in the graveyard. The\nMethodists are sensitive about it.\"\n\n\"We forget,\" said Faith dolefully. \"And the lawn is so small--and so\ncaterpillary--and so full of shrubs and things. We can't be in Rainbow\nValley all the time--and where are we to go?\"\n\n\"It's the things you DO in the graveyard. It wouldn't matter if you just\nsat here and talked quiet, same as we're doing now. Well, I don't know\nwhat is going to come of it all, but I DO know that Elder Warren is\ngoing to speak to your pa about it. Deacon Hazard is his cousin.\"\n\n\"I wish they wouldn't bother father about us,\" said Una.\n\n\"Well, people think he ought to bother himself about you a little more.\n_I_ don't--_I_ understand him. He's a child in some ways himself--that's\nwhat he is, and needs some one to look after him as bad as you do. Well,\nperhaps he'll have some one before long, if all tales is true.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Faith.\n\n\"Haven't you got any idea--honest?\" demanded Mary.\n\n\"No, no. What DO you mean?\"\n\n\"Well, you are a lot of innocents, upon my word. Why, EVERYbody is\ntalking of it. Your pa goes to see Rosemary West. SHE is going to be\nyour step-ma.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" cried Una, flushing crimson.\n\n\"Well, _I_ dunno. I just go by what folks say. _I_ don't give it for\na fact. But it would be a good thing. Rosemary West'd make you toe\nthe mark if she came here, I'll bet a cent, for all she's so sweet and\nsmiley on the face of her. They're always that way till they've caught\nthem. But you need some one to bring you up. You're disgracing your pa\nand I feel for him. I've always thought an awful lot of your pa ever\nsince that night he talked to me so nice. I've never said a single\nswear word since, or told a lie. And I'd like to see him happy and\ncomfortable, with his buttons on and his meals decent, and you young\nones licked into shape, and that old cat of a Martha put in HER proper\nplace. The way she looked at the eggs I brought her to-night. 'I hope\nthey're fresh,' says she. I just wished they WAS rotten. But you just\nmind that she gives you all one for breakfast, including your pa. Make\na fuss if she doesn't. That was what they was sent up for--but I don't\ntrust old Martha. She's quite capable of feeding 'em to her cat.\"\n\nMary's tongue being temporarily tired, a brief silence fell over the\ngraveyard. The manse children did not feel like talking. They were\ndigesting the new and not altogether palatable ideas Mary had suggested\nto them. Jerry and Carl were somewhat startled. But, after all, what did\nit matter? And it wasn't likely there was a word of truth in it. Faith,\non the whole, was pleased. Only Una was seriously upset. She felt that\nshe would like to get away and cry.\n\n\"Will there be any stars in my crown?\" sang the Methodist choir,\nbeginning to practise in the Methodist church.\n\n\"_I_ want just three,\" said Mary, whose theological knowledge had\nincreased notably since her residence with Mrs. Elliott. \"Just\nthree--setting up on my head, like a corownet, a big one in the middle\nand a small one each side.\"\n\n\"Are there different sizes in souls?\" asked Carl.\n\n\"Of course. Why, little babies must have smaller ones than big men.\nWell, it's getting dark and I must scoot home. Mrs. Elliott doesn't like\nme to be out after dark. Laws, when I lived with Mrs. Wiley the dark was\njust the same as the daylight to me. I didn't mind it no more'n a gray\ncat. Them days seem a hundred years ago. Now, you mind what I've said\nand try to behave yourselves, for you pa's sake. I'LL always back you\nup and defend you--you can be dead sure of that. Mrs. Elliott says she\nnever saw the like of me for sticking up for my friends. I was real\nsassy to Mrs. Alec Davis about you and Mrs. Elliott combed me down for\nit afterwards. The fair Cornelia has a tongue of her own and no mistake.\nBut she was pleased underneath for all, 'cause she hates old Kitty Alec\nand she's real fond of you. _I_ can see through folks.\"\n\nMary sailed off, excellently well pleased with herself, leaving a rather\ndepressed little group behind her.\n\n\"Mary Vance always says something that makes us feel bad when she comes\nup,\" said Una resentfully.\n\n\"I wish we'd left her to starve in the old barn,\" said Jerry\nvindictively.\n\n\"Oh, that's wicked, Jerry,\" rebuked Una.\n\n\"May as well have the game as the name,\" retorted unrepentant Jerry. \"If\npeople say we're so bad let's BE bad.\"\n\n\"But not if it hurts father,\" pleaded Faith.\n\nJerry squirmed uncomfortably. He adored his father. Through the unshaded\nstudy window they could see Mr. Meredith at his desk. He did not seem\nto be either reading or writing. His head was in his hands and there was\nsomething in his whole attitude that spoke of weariness and dejection.\nThe children suddenly felt it.\n\n\"I dare say somebody's been worrying him about us to-day,\" said Faith.\n\"I wish we COULD get along without making people talk. Oh--Jem Blythe!\nHow you scared me!\"\n\nJem Blythe had slipped into the graveyard and sat down beside the girls.\nHe had been prowling about Rainbow Valley and had succeeded in finding\nthe first little star-white cluster of arbutus for his mother. The manse\nchildren were rather silent after his coming. Jem was beginning to grow\naway from them somewhat this spring. He was studying for the entrance\nexamination of Queen's Academy and stayed after school with the older\npupils for extra lessons. Also, his evenings were so full of work that\nhe seldom joined the others in Rainbow Valley now. He seemed to be\ndrifting away into grown-up land.\n\n\"What is the matter with you all to-night?\" he asked. \"There's no fun in\nyou.\"\n\n\"Not much,\" agreed Faith dolefully. \"There wouldn't be much fun in you\neither if YOU knew you were disgracing your father and making people\ntalk about you.\"\n\n\"Who's been talking about you now?\"\n\n\"Everybody--so Mary Vance says.\" And Faith poured out her troubles to\nsympathetic Jem. \"You see,\" she concluded dolefully, \"we've nobody to\nbring us up. And so we get into scrapes and people think we're bad.\"\n\n\"Why don't you bring yourselves up?\" suggested Jem. \"I'll tell you what\nto do. Form a Good-Conduct Club and punish yourselves every time you do\nanything that's not right.\"\n\n\"That's a good idea,\" said Faith, struck by it. \"But,\" she added\ndoubtfully, \"things that don't seem a bit of harm to US seem simply\ndreadful to other people. How can we tell? We can't be bothering father\nall the time--and he has to be away a lot, anyhow.\"\n\n\"You could mostly tell if you stopped to think a thing over before doing\nit and ask yourselves what the congregation would say about it,\" said\nJem. \"The trouble is you just rush into things and don't think them over\nat all. Mother says you're all too impulsive, just as she used to be.\nThe Good-Conduct Club would help you to think, if you were fair and\nhonest about punishing yourselves when you broke the rules. You'd have\nto punish in some way that really HURT, or it wouldn't do any good.\"\n\n\"Whip each other?\"\n\n\"Not exactly. You'd have to think up different ways of punishment\nto suit the person. You wouldn't punish each other--you'd punish\nYOURSELVES. I read all about such a club in a story-book. You try it and\nsee how it works.\"\n\n\"Let's,\" said Faith; and when Jem was gone they agreed they would. \"If\nthings aren't right we've just got to make them right,\" said Faith,\nresolutely.\n\n\"We've got to be fair and square, as Jem says,\" said Jerry. \"This is a\nclub to bring ourselves up, seeing there's nobody else to do it. There's\nno use in having many rules. Let's just have one and any of us that\nbreaks it has got to be punished hard.\"\n\n\"But HOW.\"\n\n\"We'll think that up as we go along. We'll hold a session of the club\nhere in the graveyard every night and talk over what we've done through\nthe day, and if we think we've done anything that isn't right or that\nwould disgrace dad the one that does it, or is responsible for it,\nmust be punished. That's the rule. We'll all decide on the kind of\npunishment--it must be made to fit the crime, as Mr. Flagg says. And\nthe one that's, guilty will be bound to carry it out and no shirking.\nThere's going to be fun in this,\" concluded Jerry, with a relish.\n\n\"You suggested the soap-bubble party,\" said Faith.\n\n\"But that was before we'd formed the club,\" said Jerry hastily.\n\"Everything starts from to-night.\"\n\n\"But what if we can't agree on what's right, or what the punishment\nought to be? S'pose two of us thought of one thing and two another.\nThere ought to be five in a club like this.\"\n\n\"We can ask Jem Blythe to be umpire. He is the squarest boy in Glen St.\nMary. But I guess we can settle our own affairs mostly. We want to keep\nthis as much of a secret as we can. Don't breathe a word to Mary Vance.\nShe'd want to join and do the bringing up.\"\n\n\"_I_ think,\" said Faith, \"that there's no use in spoiling every day by\ndragging punishments in. Let's have a punishment day.\"\n\n\"We'd better choose Saturday because there is no school to interfere,\"\nsuggested Una.\n\n\"And spoil the one holiday in the week,\" cried Faith. \"Not much! No,\nlet's take Friday. That's fish day, anyhow, and we all hate fish. We may\nas well have all the disagreeable things in one day. Then other days we\ncan go ahead and have a good time.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Jerry authoritatively. \"Such a scheme wouldn't work at\nall. We'll just punish ourselves as we go along and keep a clear slate.\nNow, we all understand, don't we? This is a Good-Conduct Club, for the\npurpose of bringing ourselves up. We agree to punish ourselves for bad\nconduct, and always to stop before we do anything, no matter what, and\nask ourselves if it is likely to hurt dad in any way, and any one who\nshirks is to be cast out of the club and never allowed to play with the\nrest of us in Rainbow Valley again. Jem Blythe to be umpire in case\nof disputes. No more taking bugs to Sunday School, Carl, and no more\nchewing gum in public, if you please, Miss Faith.\"\n\n\"No more making fun of elders praying or going to the Methodist prayer\nmeeting,\" retorted Faith.\n\n\"Why, it isn't any harm to go to the Methodist prayer meeting,\"\nprotested Jerry in amazement.\n\n\"Mrs. Elliott says it is, She says manse children have no business to go\nanywhere but to Presbyterian things.\"\n\n\"Darn it, I won't give up going to the Methodist prayer meeting,\" cried\nJerry. \"It's ten times more fun than ours is.\"\n\n\"You said a naughty word,\" cried Faith. \"NOW, you've got to punish\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Not till it's all down in black and white. We're only talking the club\nover. It isn't really formed until we've written it out and signed\nit. There's got to be a constitution and by-laws. And you KNOW there's\nnothing wrong in going to a prayer meeting.\"\n\n\"But it's not only the wrong things we're to punish ourselves for, but\nanything that might hurt father.\"\n\n\"It won't hurt anybody. You know Mrs. Elliott is cracked on the subject\nof Methodists. Nobody else makes any fuss about my going. I always\nbehave myself. You ask Jem or Mrs. Blythe and see what they say. I'll\nabide by their opinion. I'm going for the paper now and I'll bring out\nthe lantern and we'll all sign.\"\n\nFifteen minutes later the document was solemnly signed on Hezekiah\nPollock's tombstone, on the centre of which stood the smoky manse\nlantern, while the children knelt around it. Mrs. Elder Clow was going\npast at the moment and next day all the Glen heard that the manse\nchildren had been having another praying competition and had wound it up\nby chasing each other all over the graves with a lantern. This piece of\nembroidery was probably suggested by the fact that, after the signing\nand sealing was completed, Carl had taken the lantern and had walked\ncircumspectly to the little hollow to examine his ant-hill. The others\nhad gone quietly into the manse and to bed.\n\n\"Do you think it is true that father is going to marry Miss West?\" Una\nhad tremulously asked of Faith, after their prayers had been said.\n\n\"I don't know, but I'd like it,\" said Faith.\n\n\"Oh, I wouldn't,\" said Una, chokingly. \"She is nice the way she is. But\nMary Vance says it changes people ALTOGETHER to be made stepmothers.\nThey get horrid cross and mean and hateful then, and turn your father\nagainst you. She says they're sure to do that. She never knew it to fail\nin a single case.\"\n\n\"I don't believe Miss West would EVER try to do that,\" cried Faith.\n\n\"Mary says ANYBODY would. She knows ALL about stepmothers, Faith--she\nsays she's seen hundreds of them--and you've never seen one. Oh, Mary\nhas told me blood-curdling things about them. She says she knew of one\nwho whipped her husband's little girls on their bare shoulders till they\nbled, and then shut them up in a cold, dark coal cellar all night. She\nsays they're ALL aching to do things like that.\"\n\n\"I don't believe Miss West would. You don't know her as well as I do,\nUna. Just think of that sweet little bird she sent me. I love it far\nmore even than Adam.\"\n\n\"It's just being a stepmother changes them. Mary says they can't help\nit. I wouldn't mind the whippings so much as having father hate us.\"\n\n\"You know nothing could make father hate us. Don't be silly, Una. I dare\nsay there's nothing to worry over. Likely if we run our club right and\nbring ourselves up properly father won't think of marrying any one. And\nif he does, I KNOW Miss West will be lovely to us.\"\n\nBut Una had no such conviction and she cried herself to sleep.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. A CHARITABLE IMPULSE\n\nFor a fortnight things ran smoothly in the Good-Conduct Club. It seemed\nto work admirably. Not once was Jem Blythe called in as umpire. Not once\ndid any of the manse children set the Glen gossips by the ears. As for\ntheir minor peccadilloes at home, they kept sharp tabs on each other and\ngamely underwent their self-imposed punishment--generally a voluntary\nabsence from some gay Friday night frolic in Rainbow Valley, or a\nsojourn in bed on some spring evening when all young bones ached to be\nout and away. Faith, for whispering in Sunday School, condemned herself\nto pass a whole day without speaking a single word, unless it was\nabsolutely necessary, and accomplished it. It was rather unfortunate\nthat Mr. Baker from over-harbour should have chosen that evening for\ncalling at the manse, and that Faith should have happened to go to\nthe door. Not one word did she reply to his genial greeting, but\nwent silently away to call her father briefly. Mr. Baker was slightly\noffended and told his wife when he went home that that the biggest\nMeredith girl seemed a very shy, sulky little thing, without manners\nenough to speak when she was spoken to. But nothing worse came of it,\nand generally their penances did no harm to themselves or anybody else.\nAll of them were beginning to feel quite cocksure that after all, it was\na very easy matter to bring yourself up.\n\n\"I guess people will soon see that we can behave ourselves properly as\nwell as anybody,\" said Faith jubilantly. \"It isn't hard when we put our\nminds to it.\"\n\nShe and Una were sitting on the Pollock tombstone. It had been a cold,\nraw, wet day of spring storm and Rainbow Valley was out of the question\nfor girls, though the manse and the Ingleside boys were down there\nfishing. The rain had held up, but the east wind blew mercilessly in\nfrom the sea, cutting to bone and marrow. Spring was late in spite of\nits early promise, and there was even yet a hard drift of old snow and\nice in the northern corner of the graveyard. Lida Marsh, who had come\nup to bring the manse a mess of herring, slipped in through the gate\nshivering. She belonged to the fishing village at the harbour mouth and\nher father had, for thirty years, made a practice of sending a mess from\nhis first spring catch to the manse. He never darkened a church door;\nhe was a hard drinker and a reckless man, but as long as he sent those\nherring up to the manse every spring, as his father had done before him,\nhe felt comfortably sure that his account with the Powers That Govern\nwas squared for the year. He would not have expected a good mackerel\ncatch if he had not so sent the first fruits of the season.\n\nLida was a mite of ten and looked younger, because she was such a small,\nwizened little creature. To-night, as she sidled boldly enough up to\nthe manse girls, she looked as if she had never been warm since she was\nborn. Her face was purple and her pale-blue, bold little eyes were\nred and watery. She wore a tattered print dress and a ragged woollen\ncomforter, tied across her thin shoulders and under her arms. She had\nwalked the three miles from the harbour mouth barefooted, over a road\nwhere there was still snow and slush and mud. Her feet and legs were\nas purple as her face. But Lida did not mind this much. She was used to\nbeing cold, and she had been going barefooted for a month already, like\nall the other swarming young fry of the fishing village. There was no\nself-pity in her heart as she sat down on the tombstone and grinned\ncheerfully at Faith and Una. Faith and Una grinned cheerfully back. They\nknew Lida slightly, having met her once or twice the preceding summer\nwhen they had gone down the harbour with the Blythes.\n\n\"Hello!\" said Lida, \"ain't this a fierce kind of a night? 'T'ain't fit\nfor a dog to be out, is it?\"\n\n\"Then why are you out?\" asked Faith.\n\n\"Pa made me bring you up some herring,\" returned Lida. She shivered,\ncoughed, and stuck out her bare feet. Lida was not thinking about\nherself or her feet, and was making no bid for sympathy. She held\nher feet out instinctively to keep them from the wet grass around the\ntombstone. But Faith and Una were instantly swamped with a wave of pity\nfor her. She looked so cold--so miserable.\n\n\"Oh, why are you barefooted on such a cold night?\" cried Faith. \"Your\nfeet must be almost frozen.\"\n\n\"Pretty near,\" said Lida proudly. \"I tell you it was fierce walking up\nthat harbour road.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you put on your shoes and stockings?\" asked Una.\n\n\"Hain't none to put on. All I had was wore out by the time winter was\nover,\" said Lida indifferently.\n\nFor a moment Faith stated in horror. This was terrible. Here was a\nlittle girl, almost a neighbour, half frozen because she had no shoes\nor stockings in this cruel spring weather. Impulsive Faith thought of\nnothing but the dreadfulness of it. In a moment she was pulling off her\nown shoes and stockings.\n\n\"Here, take these and put them right on,\" she said, forcing them into\nthe hands of the astonished Lida. \"Quick now. You'll catch your death of\ncold. I've got others. Put them right on.\"\n\nLida, recovering her wits, snatched at the offered gift, with a sparkle\nin her dull eyes. Sure she would put them on, and that mighty quick,\nbefore any one appeared with authority to recall them. In a minute\nshe had pulled the stockings over her scrawny little legs and slipped\nFaith's shoes over her thick little ankles.\n\n\"I'm obliged to you,\" she said, \"but won't your folks be cross?\"\n\n\"No--and I don't care if they are,\" said Faith. \"Do you think I could\nsee any one freezing to death without helping them if I could? It\nwouldn't be right, especially when my father's a minister.\"\n\n\"Will you want them back? It's awful cold down at the harbour\nmouth--long after it's warm up here,\" said Lida slyly.\n\n\"No, you're to keep them, of course. That is what I meant when I gave\nthem. I have another pair of shoes and plenty of stockings.\"\n\nLida had meant to stay awhile and talk to the girls about many things.\nBut now she thought she had better get away before somebody came and\nmade her yield up her booty. So she shuffled off through the bitter\ntwilight, in the noiseless, shadowy way she had slipped in. As soon as\nshe was out of sight of the manse she sat down, took off the shoes and\nstockings, and put them in her herring basket. She had no intention of\nkeeping them on down that dirty harbour road. They were to be kept good\nfor gala occasions. Not another little girl down at the harbour mouth\nhad such fine black cashmere stockings and such smart, almost new\nshoes. Lida was furnished forth for the summer. She had no qualms in the\nmatter. In her eyes the manse people were quite fabulously rich, and\nno doubt those girls had slathers of shoes and stockings. Then Lida ran\ndown to the Glen village and played for an hour with the boys before Mr.\nFlagg's store, splashing about in a pool of slush with the maddest of\nthem, until Mrs. Elliott came along and bade her begone home.\n\n\"I don't think, Faith, that you should have done that,\" said Una, a\nlittle reproachfully, after Lida had gone. \"You'll have to wear your\ngood boots every day now and they'll soon scuff out.\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" cried Faith, still in the fine glow of having done a\nkindness to a fellow creature. \"It isn't fair that I should have two\npairs of shoes and poor little Lida Marsh not have any. NOW we both have\na pair. You know perfectly well, Una, that father said in his sermon\nlast Sunday that there was no real happiness in getting or having--only\nin giving. And it's true. I feel FAR happier now than I ever did in my\nwhole life before. Just think of Lida walking home this very minute with\nher poor little feet all nice and warm and comfy.\"\n\n\"You know you haven't another pair of black cashmere stockings,\" said\nUna. \"Your other pair were so full of holes that Aunt Martha said she\ncouldn't darn them any more and she cut the legs up for stove dusters.\nYou've nothing but those two pairs of striped stockings you hate so.\"\n\nAll the glow and uplift went out of Faith. Her gladness collapsed like a\npricked balloon. She sat for a few dismal minutes in silence, facing the\nconsequences of her rash act.\n\n\"Oh, Una, I never thought of that,\" she said dolefully. \"I didn't stop\nto think at all.\"\n\nThe striped stockings were thick, heavy, coarse, ribbed stockings of\nblue and red which Aunt Martha had knit for Faith in the winter. They\nwere undoubtedly hideous. Faith loathed them as she had never loathed\nanything before. Wear them she certainly would not. They were still\nunworn in her bureau drawer.\n\n\"You'll have to wear the striped stockings after this,\" said Una. \"Just\nthink how the boys in school will laugh at you. You know how they laugh\nat Mamie Warren for her striped stockings and call her barber pole and\nyours are far worse.\"\n\n\"I won't wear them,\" said Faith. \"I'll go barefooted first, cold as it\nis.\"\n\n\"You can't go barefooted to church to-morrow. Think what people would\nsay.\"\n\n\"Then I'll stay home.\"\n\n\"You can't. You know very well Aunt Martha will make you go.\"\n\nFaith did know this. The one thing on which Aunt Martha troubled herself\nto insist was that they must all go to church, rain or shine. How they\nwere dressed, or if they were dressed at all, never concerned her. But\ngo they must. That was how Aunt Martha had been brought up seventy years\nago, and that was how she meant to bring them up.\n\n\"Haven't you got a pair you can lend me, Una?\" said poor Faith\npiteously.\n\nUna shook her head. \"No, you know I only have the one black pair. And\nthey're so tight I can hardly get them on. They wouldn't go on you.\nNeither would my gray ones. Besides, the legs of THEM are all darned AND\ndarned.\"\n\n\"I won't wear those striped stockings,\" said Faith stubbornly. \"The feel\nof them is even worse than the looks. They make me feel as if my legs\nwere as big as barrels and they're so SCRATCHY.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know what you're going to do.\"\n\n\"If father was home I'd go and ask him to get me a new pair before\nthe store closes. But he won't be home till too late. I'll ask him\nMonday--and I won't go to church tomorrow. I'll pretend I'm sick and\nAunt Martha'll HAVE to let me stay home.\"\n\n\"That would be acting a lie, Faith,\" cried Una. \"You CAN'T do that. You\nknow it would be dreadful. What would father say if he knew? Don't\nyou remember how he talked to us after mother died and told us we must\nalways be TRUE, no matter what else we failed in. He said we must never\ntell or act a lie--he said he'd TRUST us not to. You CAN'T do it, Faith.\nJust wear the striped stockings. It'll only be for once. Nobody will\nnotice them in church. It isn't like school. And your new brown dress is\nso long they won't show much. Wasn't it lucky Aunt Martha made it big,\nso you'd have room to grow in it, for all you hated it so when she\nfinished it?\"\n\n\"I won't wear those stockings,\" repeated Faith. She uncoiled her bare,\nwhite legs from the tombstone and deliberately walked through the wet,\ncold grass to the bank of snow. Setting her teeth, she stepped upon it\nand stood there.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" cried Una aghast. \"You'll catch your death of\ncold, Faith Meredith.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to,\" answered Faith. \"I hope I'll catch a fearful cold and\nbe AWFUL sick to-morrow. Then I won't be acting a lie. I'm going to\nstand here as long as I can bear it.\"\n\n\"But, Faith, you might really die. You might get pneumonia. Please,\nFaith don't. Let's go into the house and get SOMETHING for your feet.\nOh, here's Jerry. I'm so thankful. Jerry, MAKE Faith get off that snow.\nLook at her feet.\"\n\n\"Holy cats! Faith, what ARE you doing?\" demanded Jerry. \"Are you crazy?\"\n\n\"No. Go away!\" snapped Faith.\n\n\"Then are you punishing yourself for something? It isn't right, if you\nare. You'll be sick.\"\n\n\"I want to be sick. I'm not punishing myself. Go away.\"\n\n\"Where's her shoes and stockings?\" asked Jerry of Una.\n\n\"She gave them to Lida Marsh.\"\n\n\"Lida Marsh? What for?\"\n\n\"Because Lida had none--and her feet were so cold. And now she wants to\nbe sick so that she won't have to go to church to-morrow and wear her\nstriped stockings. But, Jerry, she may die.\"\n\n\"Faith,\" said Jerry, \"get off that ice-bank or I'll pull you off.\"\n\n\"Pull away,\" dared Faith.\n\nJerry sprang at her and caught her arms. He pulled one way and Faith\npulled another. Una ran behind Faith and pushed. Faith stormed at Jerry\nto leave her alone. Jerry stormed back at her not to be a dizzy idiot;\nand Una cried. They made no end of noise and they were close to the road\nfence of the graveyard. Henry Warren and his wife drove by and heard\nand saw them. Very soon the Glen heard that the manse children had been\nhaving an awful fight in the graveyard and using most improper language.\nMeanwhile, Faith had allowed herself to be pulled off the ice because\nher feet were aching so sharply that she was ready to get off any way.\nThey all went in amiably and went to bed. Faith slept like a cherub\nand woke in the morning without a trace of a cold. She felt that she\ncouldn't feign sickness and act a lie, after remembering that long-ago\ntalk with her father. But she was still as fully determined as ever that\nshe would not wear those abominable stockings to church.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV. ANOTHER SCANDAL AND ANOTHER \"EXPLANATION\"\n\nFaith went early to Sunday School and was seated in the corner of her\nclass pew before any one came. Therefore, the dreadful truth did not\nburst upon any one until Faith left the class pew near the door to walk\nup to the manse pew after Sunday School. The church was already half\nfilled and all who were sitting near the aisle saw that the minister's\ndaughter had boots on but no stockings!\n\nFaith's new brown dress, which Aunt Martha had made from an ancient\npattern, was absurdly long for her, but even so it did not meet her\nboot-tops. Two good inches of bare white leg showed plainly.\n\nFaith and Carl sat alone in the manse pew. Jerry had gone into the\ngallery to sit with a chum and the Blythe girls had taken Una with them.\nThe Meredith children were given to \"sitting all over the church\" in\nthis fashion and a great many people thought it very improper. The\ngallery especially, where irresponsible lads congregated and were known\nto whisper and suspected of chewing tobacco during service, was no\nplace, for a son of the manse. But Jerry hated the manse pew at the\nvery top of the church, under the eyes of Elder Clow and his family. He\nescaped from it whenever he could.\n\nCarl, absorbed in watching a spider spinning its web at the window, did\nnot notice Faith's legs. She walked home with her father after church\nand he never noticed them. She got on the hated striped stockings before\nJerry and Una arrived, so that for the time being none of the occupants\nof the manse knew what she had done. But nobody else in Glen St. Mary\nwas ignorant of it. The few who had not seen soon heard. Nothing else\nwas talked of on the way home from church. Mrs. Alec Davis said it was\nonly what she expected, and the next thing you would see some of those\nyoung ones coming to church with no clothes on at all. The president of\nthe Ladies' Aid decided that she would bring the matter up at the next\nAid meeting, and suggest that they wait in a body on the minister and\nprotest. Miss Cornelia said that she, for her part, gave up. There was\nno use worrying over the manse fry any longer. Even Mrs. Dr. Blythe felt\na little shocked, though she attributed the occurrence solely to Faith's\nforgetfulness. Susan could not immediately begin knitting stockings for\nFaith because it was Sunday, but she had one set up before any one else\nwas out of bed at Ingleside the next morning.\n\n\"You need not tell me anything but that it was old Martha's fault,\nMrs. Dr. dear.\" she told Anne. \"I suppose that poor little child had no\ndecent stockings to wear. I suppose every stocking she had was in holes,\nas you know very well they generally are. And _I_ think, Mrs. Dr. dear,\nthat the Ladies' Aid would be better employed in knitting some for them\nthan in fighting over the new carpet for the pulpit platform. _I_ am not\na Ladies' Aider, but I shall knit Faith two pairs of stockings, out of\nthis nice black yarn, as fast as my fingers can move and that you may\ntie to. Never shall I forget my sensations, Mrs. Dr. dear, when I saw\na minister's child walking up the aisle of our church with no stockings\non. I really did not know what way to look.\"\n\n\"And the church was just full of Methodists yesterday, too,\" groaned\nMiss Cornelia, who had come up to the Glen to do some shopping and run\ninto Ingleside to talk the affair over. \"I don't know how it is, but\njust as sure as those manse children do something especially awful the\nchurch is sure to be crowded with Methodists. I thought Mrs. Deacon\nHazard's eyes would drop out of her head. When she came out of church\nshe said, 'Well, that exhibition was no more than decent. I do pity the\nPresbyterians.' And we just had to TAKE it. There was nothing one could\nsay.\"\n\n\"There was something _I_ could have said, Mrs. Dr. dear, if I had heard\nher,\" said Susan grimly. \"I would have said, for one thing, that in my\nopinion clean bare legs were quite as decent as holes. And I would have\nsaid, for another, that the Presbyterians did not feel greatly in\nneed of pity seeing that they had a minister who could PREACH and the\nMethodists had NOT. I could have squelched Mrs. Deacon Hazard, Mrs. Dr\ndear, and that you may tie to.\"\n\n\"I wish Mr. Meredith didn't preach quite so well and looked after his\nfamily a little better,\" retorted Miss Cornelia. \"He could at least\nglance over his children before they went to church and see that they\nwere quite properly clothed. I'm tired making excuses for him, believe\nME.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Faith's soul was being harrowed up in Rainbow Valley. Mary\nVance was there and, as usual, in a lecturing mood. She gave Faith\nto understand that she had disgraced herself and her father beyond\nredemption and that she, Mary Vance, was done with her. \"Everybody\" was\ntalking, and \"everybody\" said the same thing.\n\n\"I simply feel that I can't associate with you any longer,\" she\nconcluded.\n\n\"WE are going to associate with her then,\" cried Nan Blythe. Nan\nsecretly thought Faith HAD done a awful thing, but she wasn't going to\nlet Mary Vance run matters in this high-handed fashion. \"And if YOU are\nnot you needn't come any more to Rainbow Valley, MISS Vance.\"\n\nNan and Di both put their arms around Faith and glared defiance at Mary.\nThe latter suddenly crumpled up, sat down on a stump and began to cry.\n\n\"It ain't that I don't want to,\" she wailed. \"But if I keep in with\nFaith people'll be saying I put her up to doing things. Some are saying\nit now, true's you live. I can't afford to have such things said of me,\nnow that I'm in a respectable place and trying to be a lady. And _I_\nnever went bare-legged in church in my toughest days. I'd never have\nthought of doing such a thing. But that hateful old Kitty Alec says\nFaith has never been the same girl since that time I stayed in the\nmanse. She says Cornelia Elliott will live to rue the day she took me\nin. It hurts my feelings, I tell you. But it's Mr. Meredith I'm really\nworried over.\"\n\n\"I think you needn't worry about him,\" said Di scornfully. \"It isn't\nlikely necessary. Now, Faith darling, stop crying and tell us why you\ndid it.\"\n\nFaith explained tearfully. The Blythe girls sympathized with her, and\neven Mary Vance agreed that it was a hard position to be in. But Jerry,\non whom the thing came like a thunderbolt, refused to be placated. So\nTHIS was what some mysterious hints he had got in school that day meant!\nHe marched Faith and Una home without ceremony, and the Good-Conduct\nClub held an immediate session in the graveyard to sit in judgment on\nFaith's case.\n\n\"I don't see that it was any harm,\" said Faith defiantly. \"Not MUCH of\nmy legs showed. It wasn't WRONG and it didn't hurt anybody.\"\n\n\"It will hurt Dad. You KNOW it will. You know people blame him whenever\nwe do anything queer.\"\n\n\"I didn't think of that,\" muttered Faith.\n\n\"That's just the trouble. You didn't think and you SHOULD have thought.\nThat's what our Club is for--to bring us up and MAKE us think. We\npromised we'd always stop and think before doing things. You didn't and\nyou've got to be punished, Faith--and real hard, too. You'll wear those\nstriped stockings to school for a week for punishment.\"\n\n\"Oh, Jerry, won't a day do--two days? Not a whole week!\"\n\n\"Yes, a whole week,\" said inexorable Jerry. \"It is fair--ask Jem Blythe\nif it isn't.\"\n\nFaith felt she would rather submit then ask Jem Blythe about such\na matter. She was beginning to realize that her offence was a quite\nshameful one.\n\n\"I'll do it, then,\" she muttered, a little sulkily.\n\n\"You're getting off easy,\" said, Jerry severely. \"And no matter how we\npunish you it won't help father. People will always think you just did\nit for mischief, and they'll blame father for not stopping it. We can\nnever explain it to everybody.\"\n\nThis aspect of the case weighed on Faith's mind. Her own condemnation\nshe could bear, but it tortured her that her father should be blamed. If\npeople knew the true facts of the case they would not blame him. But how\ncould she make them known to all the world? Getting up in church, as she\nhad once done, and explaining the matter was out of the question. Faith\nhad heard from Mary Vance how the congregation had looked upon that\nperformance and realized that she must not repeat it. Faith worried over\nthe problem for half a week. Then she had an inspiration and promptly\nacted upon it. She spent that evening in the garret, with a lamp and an\nexercise book, writing busily, with flushed cheeks and shining eyes. It\nwas the very thing! How clever she was to have thought of it! It would\nput everything right and explain everything and yet cause no scandal. It\nwas eleven o'clock when she had finished to her satisfaction and crept\ndown to bed, dreadfully tired, but perfectly happy.\n\nIn a few days the little weekly published in the Glen under the name of\n_The Journal_ came out as usual, and the Glen had another sensation. A\nletter signed \"Faith Meredith\" occupied a prominent place on the front\npage and ran as follows:--\n\n\"TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:\n\n\"I want to explain to everybody how it was I came to go to church without\nstockings on, so that everybody will know that father was not to blame\none bit for it, and the old gossips need not say he is, because it is\nnot true. I gave my only pair of black stockings to Lida Marsh, because\nshe hadn't any and her poor little feet were awful cold and I was so\nsorry for her. No child ought to have to go without shoes and stockings\nin a Christian community before the snow is all gone, and I think the W.\nF. M. S. ought to have given her stockings. Of course, I know they are\nsending things to the little heathen children, and that is all right and\na kind thing to do. But the little heathen children have lots more warm\nweather than we have, and I think the women of our church ought to look\nafter Lida and not leave it all to me. When I gave her my stockings I\nforgot they were the only black pair I had without holes, but I am\nglad I did give them to her, because my conscience would have been\nuncomfortable if I hadn't. When she had gone away, looking so proud and\nhappy, the poor little thing, I remembered that all I had to wear were\nthe horrid red and blue things Aunt Martha knit last winter for me\nout of some yarn that Mrs. Joseph Burr of Upper Glen sent us. It was\ndreadfully coarse yarn and all knots, and I never saw any of Mrs. Burr's\nown children wearing things made of such yarn. But Mary Vance says Mrs.\nBurr gives the minister stuff that she can't use or eat herself, and\nthinks it ought to go as part of the salary her husband signed to pay,\nbut never does.\n\n\"I just couldn't bear to wear those hateful stockings. They were so ugly\nand rough and felt so scratchy. Everybody would have made fun of me. I\nthought at first I'd pretend to be sick and not go to church next day,\nbut I decided I couldn't do that, because it would be acting a lie, and\nfather told us after mother died that was something we must never, never\ndo. It is just as bad to act a lie as to tell one, though I know some\npeople, right here in the Glen, who act them, and never seem to feel a\nbit bad about it. I will not mention any names, but I know who they are\nand so does father.\n\n\"Then I tried my best to catch cold and really be sick by standing on the\nsnowbank in the Methodist graveyard with my bare feet until Jerry pulled\nme off. But it didn't hurt me a bit and so I couldn't get out of going\nto church. So I just decided I would put my boots on and go that way. I\ncan't see why it was so wrong and I was so careful to wash my legs just\nas clean as my face, but, anyway, father wasn't to blame for it. He was\nin the study thinking of his sermon and other heavenly things, and I\nkept out of his way before I went to Sunday School. Father does not look\nat people's legs in church, so of course he did not notice mine, but all\nthe gossips did and talked about it, and that is why I am writing this\nletter to the _Journal_ to explain. I suppose I did very wrong, since\neverybody says so, and I am sorry and I am wearing those awful stockings\nto punish myself, although father bought me two nice new black pairs as\nsoon as Mr. Flagg's store opened on Monday morning. But it was all my\nfault, and if people blame father for it after they read this they are\nnot Christians and so I do not mind what they say.\n\n\"There is another thing I want to explain about before I stop. Mary\nVance told me that Mr. Evan Boyd is blaming the Lew Baxters for stealing\npotatoes out of his field last fall. They did not touch his potatoes.\nThey are very poor, but they are honest. It was us did it--Jerry and\nCarl and I. Una was not with us at the time. We never thought it was\nstealing. We just wanted a few potatoes to cook over a fire in Rainbow\nValley one evening to eat with our fried trout. Mr. Boyd's field was the\nnearest, just between the valley and the village, so we climbed over his\nfence and pulled up some stalks. The potatoes were awful small, because\nMr. Boyd did not put enough fertilizer on them and we had to pull up a\nlot of stalks before we got enough, and then they were not much bigger\nthan marbles. Walter and Di Blythe helped us eat them, but they did not\ncome along until we had them cooked and did not know where we got them,\nso they were not to blame at all, only us. We didn't mean any harm, but\nif it was stealing we are very sorry and we will pay Mr. Boyd for them\nif he will wait until we grow up. We never have any money now because we\nare not big enough to earn any, and Aunt Martha says it takes every cent\nof poor father's salary, even when it is paid up regularly--and it isn't\noften--to run this house. But Mr. Boyd must not blame the Lew Baxters\nany more, when they were quite innocent, and give them a bad name.\n\n\"Yours respectfully,\n\n\"FAITH MEREDITH.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI. MISS CORNELIA GETS A NEW POINT OF VIEW\n\n\"Susan, after I'm dead I'm going to come back to earth every time when\nthe daffodils blow in this garden,\" said Anne rapturously. \"Nobody may\nsee me, but I'll be here. If anybody is in the garden at the time--I\nTHINK I'll come on an evening just like this, but it MIGHT be just at\ndawn--a lovely, pale-pinky spring dawn--they'll just see the daffodils\nnodding wildly as if an extra gust of wind had blown past them, but it\nwill be _I_.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Mrs. Dr. dear, you will not be thinking of flaunting worldly\nthings like daffies after you are dead,\" said Susan. \"And I do NOT\nbelieve in ghosts, seen or unseen.\"\n\n\"Oh, Susan, I shall not be a ghost! That has such a horrible sound. I\nshall just be ME. And I shall run around in the twilight, whether it is\nmorn or eve, and see all the spots I love. Do you remember how badly I\nfelt when I left our little House of Dreams, Susan? I thought I could\nnever love Ingleside so well. But I do. I love every inch of the ground\nand every stick and stone on it.\"\n\n\"I am rather fond of the place myself,\" said Susan, who would have died\nif she had been removed from it, \"but we must not set our affections too\nmuch on earthly things, Mrs. Dr. dear. There are such things as fires\nand earthquakes. We should always be prepared. The Tom MacAllisters\nover-harbour were burned out three nights ago. Some say Tom MacAllister\nset the house on fire himself to get the insurance. That may or may not\nbe. But I advise the doctor to have our chimneys seen to at once. An\nounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. But I see Mrs. Marshall\nElliott coming in at the gate, looking as if she had been sent for and\ncouldn't go.\"\n\n\"Anne dearie, have you seen the _Journal_ to-day?\"\n\nMiss Cornelia's voice was trembling, partly from emotion, partly from\nthe fact that she had hurried up from the store too fast and lost her\nbreath.\n\nAnne bent over the daffodils to hide a smile. She and Gilbert had\nlaughed heartily and heartlessly over the front page of the _Journal_\nthat day, but she knew that to dear Miss Cornelia it was almost a\ntragedy, and she must not wound her feelings by any display of levity.\n\n\"Isn't it dreadful? What IS to be done?\" asked Miss Cornelia\ndespairingly. Miss Cornelia had vowed that she was done with worrying\nover the pranks of the manse children, but she went on worrying just the\nsame.\n\nAnne led the way to the veranda, where Susan was knitting, with Shirley\nand Rilla conning their primers on either side. Susan was already on\nher second pair of stockings for Faith. Susan never worried over poor\nhumanity. She did what in her lay for its betterment and serenely left\nthe rest to the Higher Powers.\n\n\"Cornelia Elliott thinks she was born to run this world, Mrs. Dr.\ndear,\" she had once said to Anne, \"and so she is always in a stew over\nsomething. I have never thought _I_ was, and so I go calmly along. Not\nbut what it has sometimes occurred to me that things might be run a\nlittle better than they are. But it is not for us poor worms to nourish\nsuch thoughts. They only make us uncomfortable and do not get us\nanywhere.\"\n\n\"I don't see that anything can be done--now--\" said Anne, pulling out\na nice, cushiony chair for Miss Cornelia. \"But how in the world did Mr.\nVickers allow that letter to be printed? Surely he should have known\nbetter.\"\n\n\"Why, he's away, Anne dearie--he's been away to New Brunswick for a\nweek. And that young scalawag of a Joe Vickers is editing the _Journal_\nin his absence. Of course, Mr. Vickers would never have put it in, even\nif he is a Methodist, but Joe would just think it a good joke. As you\nsay, I don't suppose there is anything to be done now, only live it\ndown. But if I ever get Joe Vickers cornered somewhere I'll give him\na talking to he won't forget in a hurry. I wanted Marshall to stop our\nsubscription to the _Journal_ instantly, but he only laughed and said\nthat to-day's issue was the only one that had had anything readable in\nit for a year. Marshall never will take anything seriously--just like a\nman. Fortunately, Evan Boyd is like that, too. He takes it as a joke and\nis laughing all over the place about it. And he's another Methodist! As\nfor Mrs. Burr of Upper Glen, of course she will be furious and they will\nleave the church. Not that it will be a great loss from any point of\nview. The Methodists are quite welcome to THEM.\"\n\n\"It serves Mrs. Burr right,\" said Susan, who had an old feud with the\nlady in question and had been hugely tickled over the reference to her\nin Faith's letter. \"She will find that she will not be able to cheat the\nMethodist parson out of HIS salary with bad yarn.\"\n\n\"The worst of it is, there's not much hope of things getting any\nbetter,\" said Miss Cornelia gloomily. \"As long as Mr. Meredith was\ngoing to see Rosemary West I did hope the manse would soon have a\nproper mistress. But that is all off. I suppose she wouldn't have him on\naccount of the children--at least, everybody seems to think so.\"\n\n\"I do not believe that he ever asked her,\" said Susan, who could not\nconceive of any one refusing a minister.\n\n\"Well, nobody knows anything about THAT. But one thing is certain,\nhe doesn't go there any longer. And Rosemary didn't look well all the\nspring. I hope her visit to Kingsport will do her good. She's been gone\nfor a month and will stay another month, I understand. I can't remember\nwhen Rosemary was away from home before. She and Ellen could never bear\nto be parted. But I understand Ellen insisted on her going this time.\nAnd meanwhile Ellen and Norman Douglas are warming up the old soup.\"\n\n\"Is that really so?\" asked Anne, laughing. \"I heard a rumour of it, but\nI hardly believed it.\"\n\n\"Believe it! You may believe it all right, Anne, dearie. Nobody is in\nignorance of it. Norman Douglas never left anybody in doubt as to his\nintentions in regard to anything. He always did his courting before the\npublic. He told Marshall that he hadn't thought about Ellen for years,\nbut the first time he went to church last fall he saw her and fell in\nlove with her all over again. He said he'd clean forgot how handsome\nshe was. He hadn't seen her for twenty years, if you can believe it. Of\ncourse he never went to church, and Ellen never went anywhere else\nround here. Oh, we all know what Norman means, but what Ellen means is a\ndifferent matter. I shan't take it upon me to predict whether it will be\na match or not.\"\n\n\"He jilted her once--but it seems that does not count with some people,\nMrs. Dr. dear,\" Susan remarked rather acidly.\n\n\"He jilted her in a fit of temper and repented it all his life,\" said\nMiss Cornelia. \"That is different from a cold-blooded jilting. For my\npart, I never detested Norman as some folks do. He could never over-crow\nME. I DO wonder what started him coming to church. I have never been\nable to believe Mrs. Wilsons's story that Faith Meredith went there and\nbullied him into it. I've always intended to ask Faith herself, but I've\nnever happened to think of it just when I saw her. What influence could\nSHE have over Norman Douglas? He was in the store when I left, bellowing\nwith laughter over that scandalous letter. You could have heard him at\nFour Winds Point. 'The greatest girl in the world,' he was shouting.\n'She's that full of spunk she's bursting with it. And all the old\ngrannies want to tame her, darn them. But they'll never be able to do\nit--never! They might as well try to drown a fish. Boyd, see that you\nput more fertilizer on your potatoes next year. Ho, ho, ho!' And then he\nlaughed till the roof shook.\"\n\n\"Mr. Douglas pays well to the salary, at least,\" remarked Susan.\n\n\"Oh, Norman isn't mean in some ways. He'd give a thousand without\nblinking a lash, and roar like a Bull of Bashan if he had to pay five\ncents too much for anything. Besides, he likes Mr. Meredith's sermons,\nand Norman Douglas was always willing to shell out if he got his brains\ntickled up. There is no more Christianity about him than there is about\na black, naked heathen in Africa and never will be. But he's clever and\nwell read and he judges sermons as he would lectures. Anyhow, it's well\nhe backs up Mr. Meredith and the children as he does, for they'll need\nfriends more than ever after this. I am tired of making excuses for\nthem, believe ME.\"\n\n\"Do you know, dear Miss Cornelia,\" said Anne seriously, \"I think we have\nall been making too many excuses. It is very foolish and we ought to\nstop it. I am going to tell you what I'd LIKE to do. I shan't do it, of\ncourse\"--Anne had noted a glint of alarm in Susan's eye--\"it would be\ntoo unconventional, and we must be conventional or die, after we reach\nwhat is supposed to be a dignified age. But I'd LIKE to do it. I'd like\nto call a meeting of the Ladies Aid and W.M.S. and the Girls Sewing\nSociety, and include in the audience all and any Methodists who have\nbeen criticizing the Merediths--although I do think if we Presbyterians\nstopped criticizing and excusing we would find that other denominations\nwould trouble themselves very little about our manse folks. I would\nsay to them, 'Dear Christian friends'--with marked emphasis on\n'Christian'--I have something to say to you and I want to say it good\nand hard, that you may take it home and repeat it to your families.\nYou Methodists need not pity us, and we Presbyterians need not pity\nourselves. We are not going to do it any more. And we are going to say,\nboldly and truthfully, to all critics and sympathizers, 'We are PROUD of\nour minister and his family. Mr. Meredith is the best preacher Glen\nSt. Mary church ever had. Moreover, he is a sincere, earnest teacher of\ntruth and Christian charity. He is a faithful friend, a judicious pastor\nin all essentials, and a refined, scholarly, well-bred man. His family\nare worthy of him. Gerald Meredith is the cleverest pupil in the Glen\nschool, and Mr. Hazard says that he is destined to a brilliant career.\nHe is a manly, honourable, truthful little fellow. Faith Meredith is\na beauty, and as inspiring and original as she is beautiful. There\nis nothing commonplace about her. All the other girls in the Glen put\ntogether haven't the vim, and wit, and joyousness and 'spunk' she has.\nShe has not an enemy in the world. Every one who knows her loves her.\nOf how many, children or grown-ups, can that be said? Una Meredith\nis sweetness personified. She will make a most lovable woman. Carl\nMeredith, with his love for ants and frogs and spiders, will some day\nbe a naturalist whom all Canada--nay, all the world, will delight to\nhonour. Do you know of any other family in the Glen, or out of it, of\nwhom all these things can be said? Away with shamefaced excuses and\napologies. We REJOICE in our minister and his splendid boys and girls!\"\n\nAnne stopped, partly because she was out of breath after her vehement\nspeech and partly because she could not trust herself to speak further\nin view of Miss Cornelia's face. That good lady was staring helplessly\nat Anne, apparently engulfed in billows of new ideas. But she came up\nwith a gasp and struck out for shore gallantly.\n\n\"Anne Blythe, I wish you WOULD call that meeting and say just that!\nYou've made me ashamed of myself, for one, and far be it from me\nto refuse to admit it. OF COURSE, that is how we should have\ntalked--especially to the Methodists. And it's every word of it\ntrue--every word. We've just been shutting our eyes to the big\nworth-while things and squinting them on the little things that don't\nreally matter a pin's worth. Oh, Anne dearie, I can see a thing when\nit's hammered into my head. No more apologizing for Cornelia Marshall!\n_I_ shall hold MY head up after this, believe ME--though I MAY talk\nthings over with you as usual just to relieve my feelings if the\nMerediths do any more startling stunts. Even that letter I felt so bad\nabout--why, it's only a good joke after all, as Norman says. Not many\ngirls would have been cute enough to think of writing it--and all\npunctuated so nicely and not one word misspelled. Just let me hear any\nMethodist say one word about it--though all the same I'll never forgive\nJoe Vickers--believe ME! Where are the rest of your small fry to-night?\"\n\n\"Walter and the twins are in Rainbow Valley. Jem is studying in the\ngarret.\"\n\n\"They are all crazy about Rainbow Valley. Mary Vance thinks it's the\nonly place in the world. She'd be off up here every evening if I'd let\nher. But I don't encourage her in gadding. Besides, I miss the creature\nwhen she isn't around, Anne dearie. I never thought I'd get so fond of\nher. Not but what I see her faults and try to correct them. But she has\nnever said one saucy word to me since she came to my house and she is\na GREAT help--for when all is said and done, Anne dearie, I am not so\nyoung as I once was, and there is no sense denying it. I was fifty-nine\nmy last birthday. I don't FEEL it, but there is no gainsaying the Family\nBible.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII. A SACRED CONCERT\n\nIn spite of Miss Cornelia's new point of view she could not help feeling\na little disturbed over the next performance of the manse children.\nIn public she carried off the situation splendidly, saying to all the\ngossips the substance of what Anne had said in daffodil time, and saying\nit so pointedly and forcibly that her hearers found themselves feeling\nrather foolish and began to think that, after all, they were making too\nmuch of a childish prank. But in private Miss Cornelia allowed herself\nthe relief of bemoaning it to Anne.\n\n\"Anne dearie, they had a CONCERT IN THE GRAVEYARD last Thursday evening,\nwhile the Methodist prayer meeting was going on. There they sat, on\nHezekiah Pollock's tombstone, and sang for a solid hour. Of course,\nI understand it was mostly hymns they sang, and it wouldn't have been\nquite so bad if they'd done nothing else. But I'm told they finished\nup with _Polly Wolly Doodle_ at full length--and that just when Deacon\nBaxter was praying.\"\n\n\"I was there that night,\" said Susan, \"and, although I did not say\nanything about it to you, Mrs. Dr. dear, I could not help thinking that\nit was a great pity they picked that particular evening. It was truly\nblood-curdling to hear them sitting there in that abode of the dead,\nshouting that frivolous song at the tops of their lungs.\"\n\n\"I don't know what YOU were doing in a Methodist prayer meeting,\" said\nMiss Cornelia acidly.\n\n\"I have never found that Methodism was catching,\" retorted Susan\nstiffly. \"And, as I was going to say when I was interrupted, badly as I\nfelt, I did NOT give in to the Methodists. When Mrs. Deacon Baxter said,\nas we came out, 'What a disgraceful exhibition!' _I_ said, looking her\nfairly in the eye, 'They are all beautiful singers, and none of YOUR\nchoir, Mrs. Baxter, ever bother themselves coming out to your prayer\nmeeting, it seems. Their voices appear to be in tune only on Sundays!'\nShe was quite meek and I felt that I had snubbed her properly. But I\ncould have done it much more thoroughly, Mrs. Dr. dear, if only they\nhad left out _Polly Wolly Doodle_. It is truly terrible to think of that\nbeing sung in a graveyard.\"\n\n\"Some of those dead folks sang _Polly Wolly Doodle_ when they were\nliving, Susan. Perhaps they like to hear it yet,\" suggested Gilbert.\n\nMiss Cornelia looked at him reproachfully and made up her mind that, on\nsome future occasion, she would hint to Anne that the doctor should\nbe admonished not to say such things. They might injure his practice.\nPeople might get it into their heads that he wasn't orthodox. To be\nsure, Marshall said even worse things habitually, but then HE was not a\npublic man.\n\n\"I understand that their father was in his study all the time, with his\nwindows open, but never noticed them at all. Of course, he was lost in a\nbook as usual. But I spoke to him about it yesterday, when he called.\"\n\n\"How could you dare, Mrs. Marshall Elliott?\" asked Susan rebukingly.\n\n\"Dare! It's time somebody dared something. Why, they say he knows\nnothing about that letter of Faith's to the JOURNAL because nobody\nliked to mention it to him. He never looks at a JOURNAL of course. But\nI thought he ought to know of this to prevent any such performances\nin future. He said he would 'discuss it with them.' But of course he'd\nnever think of it again after he got out of our gate. That man has no\nsense of humour, Anne, believe ME. He preached last Sunday on 'How to\nBring up Children.' A beautiful sermon it was, too--and everybody in\nchurch thinking 'what a pity you can't practise what you preach.'\"\n\nMiss Cornelia did Mr. Meredith an injustice in thinking he would soon\nforget what she had told him. He went home much disturbed and when the\nchildren came from Rainbow Valley that night, at a much later hour than\nthey should have been prowling in it, he called them into his study.\n\nThey went in, somewhat awed. It was such an unusual thing for their\nfather to do. What could he be going to say to them? They racked their\nmemories for any recent transgression of sufficient importance, but\ncould not recall any. Carl had spilled a saucerful of jam on Mrs.\nPeter Flagg's silk dress two evenings before, when, at Aunt Martha's\ninvitation, she had stayed to supper. But Mr. Meredith had not noticed\nit, and Mrs. Flagg, who was a kindly soul, had made no fuss. Besides,\nCarl had been punished by having to wear Una's dress all the rest of the\nevening.\n\nUna suddenly thought that perhaps her father meant to tell them that he\nwas going to marry Miss West. Her heart began to beat violently and\nher legs trembled. Then she saw that Mr. Meredith looked very stern and\nsorrowful. No, it could not be that.\n\n\"Children,\" said Mr. Meredith, \"I have heard something that has pained\nme very much. Is it true that you sat out in the graveyard all last\nThursday evening and sang ribald songs while a prayer meeting was being\nheld in the Methodist church?\"\n\n\"Great Caesar, Dad, we forgot all about it being their prayer meeting\nnight,\" exclaimed Jerry in dismay.\n\n\"Then it is true--you did do this thing?\"\n\n\"Why, Dad, I don't know what you mean by ribald songs. We sang hymns--it\nwas a sacred concert, you know. What harm was that? I tell you we never\nthought about it's being Methodist prayer meeting night. They used to\nhave their meeting Tuesday nights and since they've changed to Thursdays\nit's hard to remember.\"\n\n\"Did you sing nothing but hymns?\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Jerry, turning red, \"we DID sing _Polly Wolly Doodle_ at the\nlast. Faith said, 'Let's have something cheerful to wind up with.' But\nwe didn't mean any harm, Father--truly we didn't.\"\n\n\"The concert was my idea, Father,\" said Faith, afraid that Mr. Meredith\nmight blame Jerry too much. \"You know the Methodists themselves had a\nsacred concert in their church three Sunday nights ago. I thought\nit would be good fun to get one up in imitation of it. Only they had\nprayers at theirs, and we left that part out, because we heard that\npeople thought it awful for us to pray in a graveyard. YOU were sitting\nin here all the time,\" she added, \"and never said a word to us.\"\n\n\"I did not notice what you were doing. That is no excuse for me, of\ncourse. I am more to blame than you--I realize that. But why did you\nsing that foolish song at the end?\"\n\n\"We didn't think,\" muttered Jerry, feeling that it was a very\nlame excuse, seeing that he had lectured Faith so strongly in the\nGood-Conduct Club sessions for her lack of thought. \"We're sorry,\nFather--truly, we are. Pitch into us hard--we deserve a regular combing\ndown.\"\n\nBut Mr. Meredith did no combing down or pitching into. He sat down and\ngathered his small culprits close to him and talked a little to them,\ntenderly and wisely. They were overcome with remorse and shame, and felt\nthat they could never be so silly and thoughtless again.\n\n\"We've just got to punish ourselves good and hard for this,\" whispered\nJerry as they crept upstairs. \"We'll have a session of the Club first\nthing tomorrow and decide how we'll do it. I never saw father so cut up.\nBut I wish to goodness the Methodists would stick to one night for their\nprayer meeting and not wander all over the week.\"\n\n\"Anyhow, I'm glad it wasn't what I was afraid it was,\" murmured Una to\nherself.\n\nBehind them, in the study, Mr. Meredith had sat down at his desk and\nburied his face in his arms.\n\n\"God help me!\" he said. \"I'm a poor sort of father. Oh, Rosemary! If you\nhad only cared!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII. A FAST DAY\n\nThe Good-Conduct Club had a special session the next morning before\nschool. After various suggestions, it was decided that a fast day would\nbe an appropriate punishment.\n\n\"We won't eat a single thing for a whole day,\" said Jerry. \"I'm kind of\ncurious to see what fasting is like, anyhow. This will be a good chance\nto find out.\"\n\n\"What day will we choose for it?\" asked Una, who thought it would be\nquite an easy punishment and rather wondered that Jerry and Faith had\nnot devised something harder.\n\n\"Let's pick Monday,\" said Faith. \"We mostly have a pretty FILLING dinner\non Sundays, and Mondays meals never amount to much anyhow.\"\n\n\"But that's just the point,\" exclaimed Jerry. \"We mustn't take the\neasiest day to fast, but the hardest--and that's Sunday, because, as\nyou say, we mostly have roast beef that day instead of cold ditto. It\nwouldn't be much punishment to fast from ditto. Let's take next Sunday.\nIt will be a good day, for father is going to exchange for the morning\nservice with the Upper Lowbridge minister. Father will be away till\nevening. If Aunt Martha wonders what's got into us, we'll tell her right\nup that we're fasting for the good of our souls, and it is in the Bible\nand she is not to interfere, and I guess she won't.\"\n\nAunt Martha did not. She merely said in her fretful mumbling way, \"What\nfoolishness are you young rips up to now?\" and thought no more about it.\nMr. Meredith had gone away early in the morning before any one was up.\nHe went without his breakfast, too, but that was, of course, of common\noccurrence. Half of the time he forgot it and there was no one to remind\nhim of it. Breakfast--Aunt Martha's breakfast--was not a hard meal to\nmiss. Even the hungry \"young rips\" did not feel it any great deprivation\nto abstain from the \"lumpy porridge and blue milk\" which had aroused\nthe scorn of Mary Vance. But it was different at dinner time. They were\nfuriously hungry then, and the odor of roast beef which pervaded the\nmanse, and which was wholly delightful in spite of the fact that the\nroast beef was badly underdone, was almost more than they could stand.\nIn desperation they rushed to the graveyard where they couldn't smell\nit. But Una could not keep her eyes from the dining room window, through\nwhich the Upper Lowbridge minister could be seen, placidly eating.\n\n\"If I could only have just a weeny, teeny piece,\" she sighed.\n\n\"Now, you stop that,\" commanded Jerry. \"Of course it's hard--but that's\nthe punishment of it. I could eat a graven image this very minute, but\nam I complaining? Let's think of something else. We've just got to rise\nabove our stomachs.\"\n\nAt supper time they did not feel the pangs of hunger which they had\nsuffered earlier in the day.\n\n\"I suppose we're getting used to it,\" said Faith. \"I feel an awfully\nqueer all-gone sort of feeling, but I can't say I'm hungry.\"\n\n\"My head is funny,\" said Una. \"It goes round and round sometimes.\"\n\nBut she went gamely to church with the others. If Mr. Meredith had not\nbeen so wholly wrapped up in and carried away with his subject he might\nhave noticed the pale little face and hollow eyes in the manse pew\nbeneath. But he noticed nothing and his sermon was something longer\nthan usual. Then, just before he gave out the final hymn, Una Meredith\ntumbled off the seat of the manse pew and lay in a dead faint on the\nfloor.\n\nMrs. Elder Clow was the first to reach her. She caught the thin little\nbody from the arms of white-faced, terrified Faith and carried it into\nthe vestry. Mr. Meredith forgot the hymn and everything else and rushed\nmadly after her. The congregation dismissed itself as best it could.\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Clow,\" gasped Faith, \"is Una dead? Have we killed her?\"\n\n\"What is the matter with my child?\" demanded the pale father.\n\n\"She has just fainted, I think,\" said Mrs. Clow. \"Oh, here's the doctor,\nthank goodness.\"\n\nGilbert did not find it a very easy thing to bring Una back to\nconsciousness. He worked over her for a long time before her eyes\nopened. Then he carried her over to the manse, followed by Faith,\nsobbing hysterically in her relief.\n\n\"She is just hungry, you know--she didn't eat a thing to-day--none of us\ndid--we were all fasting.\"\n\n\"Fasting!\" said Mr. Meredith, and \"Fasting?\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Yes--to punish ourselves for singing _Polly Wolly_ in the graveyard,\"\nsaid Faith.\n\n\"My child, I don't want you to punish yourselves for that,\" said Mr.\nMeredith in distress. \"I gave you your little scolding--and you were all\npenitent--and I forgave you.\"\n\n\"Yes, but we had to be punished,\" explained Faith. \"It's our rule--in\nour Good-Conduct Club, you know--if we do anything wrong, or anything\nthat is likely to hurt father in the congregation, we HAVE to punish\nourselves. We are bringing ourselves up, you know, because there is\nnobody to do it.\"\n\nMr. Meredith groaned, but the doctor got up from Una's side with an air\nof relief.\n\n\"Then this child simply fainted from lack of food and all she needs is\na good square meal,\" he said. \"Mrs. Clow, will you be kind enough to see\nshe gets it? And I think from Faith's story that they all would be the\nbetter for something to eat, or we shall have more faintings.\"\n\n\"I suppose we shouldn't have made Una fast,\" said Faith remorsefully.\n\"When I think of it, only Jerry and I should have been punished. WE got\nup the concert and we were the oldest.\"\n\n\"I sang _Polly Wolly_ just the same as the rest of you,\" said Una's weak\nlittle voice, \"so I had to be punished, too.\"\n\nMrs. Clow came with a glass of milk, Faith and Jerry and Carl sneaked\noff to the pantry, and John Meredith went into his study, where he sat\nin the darkness for a long time, alone with his bitter thoughts. So his\nchildren were bringing themselves up because there was \"nobody to do\nit\"--struggling along amid their little perplexities without a hand to\nguide or a voice to counsel. Faith's innocently uttered phrase rankled\nin her father's mind like a barbed shaft. There was \"nobody\" to look\nafter them--to comfort their little souls and care for their little\nbodies. How frail Una had looked, lying there on the vestry sofa in that\nlong faint! How thin were her tiny hands, how pallid her little face!\nShe looked as if she might slip away from him in a breath--sweet little\nUna, of whom Cecilia had begged him to take such special care. Since his\nwife's death he had not felt such an agony of dread as when he had hung\nover his little girl in her unconsciousness. He must do something--but\nwhat? Should he ask Elizabeth Kirk to marry him? She was a good\nwoman--she would be kind to his children. He might bring himself to\ndo it if it were not for his love for Rosemary West. But until he had\ncrushed that out he could not seek another woman in marriage. And he\ncould not crush it out--he had tried and he could not. Rosemary had\nbeen in church that evening, for the first time since her return from\nKingsport. He had caught a glimpse of her face in the back of the\ncrowded church, just as he had finished his sermon. His heart had given\na fierce throb. He sat while the choir sang the \"collection piece,\" with\nhis bent head and tingling pulses. He had not seen her since the evening\nupon which he had asked her to marry him. When he had risen to give out\nthe hymn his hands were trembling and his pale face was flushed. Then\nUna's fainting spell had banished everything from his mind for a time.\nNow, in the darkness and solitude of the study it rushed back. Rosemary\nwas the only woman in the world for him. It was of no use for him to\nthink of marrying any other. He could not commit such a sacrilege even\nfor his children's sake. He must take up his burden alone--he must try\nto be a better, a more watchful father--he must tell his children not to\nbe afraid to come to him with all their little problems. Then he lighted\nhis lamp and took up a bulky new book which was setting the theological\nworld by the ears. He would read just one chapter to compose his mind.\nFive minutes later he was lost to the world and the troubles of the\nworld.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX. A WEIRD TALE\n\nOn an early June evening Rainbow Valley was an entirely delightful place\nand the children felt it to be so, as they sat in the open glade where\nthe bells rang elfishly on the Tree Lovers, and the White Lady shook\nher green tresses. The wind was laughing and whistling about them like\na leal, glad-hearted comrade. The young ferns were spicy in the hollow.\nThe wild cherry trees scattered over the valley, among the dark firs,\nwere mistily white. The robins were whistling over in the maples behind\nIngleside. Beyond, on the slopes of the Glen, were blossoming orchards,\nsweet and mystic and wonderful, veiled in dusk. It was spring, and young\nthings MUST be glad in spring. Everybody was glad in Rainbow Valley\nthat evening--until Mary Vance froze their blood with the story of Henry\nWarren's ghost.\n\nJem was not there. Jem spent his evenings now studying for his entrance\nexamination in the Ingleside garret. Jerry was down near the pond,\ntrouting. Walter had been reading Longfellow's sea poems to the others\nand they were steeped in the beauty and mystery of the ships. Then they\ntalked of what they would do when they were grown up--where they would\ntravel--the far, fair shores they would see. Nan and Di meant to go to\nEurope. Walter longed for the Nile moaning past its Egyptian sands, and\na glimpse of the sphinx. Faith opined rather dismally that she supposed\nshe would have to be a missionary--old Mrs. Taylor told her she ought\nto be--and then she would at least see India or China, those mysterious\nlands of the Orient. Carl's heart was set on African jungles. Una\nsaid nothing. She thought she would just like to stay at home. It was\nprettier here than anywhere else. It would be dreadful when they were\nall grown up and had to scatter over the world. The very idea made Una\nfeel lonesome and homesick. But the others dreamed on delightedly until\nMary Vance arrived and vanished poesy and dreams at one fell swoop.\n\n\"Laws, but I'm out of puff,\" she exclaimed. \"I've run down that hill\nlike sixty. I got an awful scare up there at the old Bailey place.\"\n\n\"What frightened you?\" asked Di.\n\n\"I dunno. I was poking about under them lilacs in the old garden, trying\nto see if there was any lilies-of-the-valley out yet. It was dark as\na pocket there--and all at once I seen something stirring and rustling\nround at the other side of the garden, in those cherry bushes. It was\nWHITE. I tell you I didn't stop for a second look. I flew over the dyke\nquicker than quick. I was sure it was Henry Warren's ghost.\"\n\n\"Who was Henry Warren?\" asked Di.\n\n\"And why should he have a ghost?\" asked Nan.\n\n\"Laws, did you never hear the story? And you brought up in the Glen.\nWell, wait a minute till I get by breath all back and I'll tell you.\"\n\nWalter shivered delightsomely. He loved ghost stories. Their mystery,\ntheir dramatic climaxes, their eeriness gave him a fearful, exquisite\npleasure. Longfellow instantly grew tame and commonplace. He threw the\nbook aside and stretched himself out, propped upon his elbows to listen\nwhole-heartedly, fixing his great luminous eyes on Mary's face. Mary\nwished he wouldn't look at her so. She felt she could make a better job\nof the ghost story if Walter were not looking at her. She could put on\nseveral frills and invent a few artistic details to enhance the horror.\nAs it was, she had to stick to the bare truth--or what had been told her\nfor the truth.\n\n\"Well,\" she began, \"you know old Tom Bailey and his wife used to live in\nthat house up there thirty years ago. He was an awful old rip, they say,\nand his wife wasn't much better. They'd no children of their own, but a\nsister of old Tom's died and left a little boy--this Henry Warren--and\nthey took him. He was about twelve when he came to them, and kind of\nundersized and delicate. They say Tom and his wife used him awful from\nthe start--whipped him and starved him. Folks said they wanted him to\ndie so's they could get the little bit of money his mother had left for\nhim. Henry didn't die right off, but he begun having fits--epileps, they\ncalled 'em--and he grew up kind of simple, till he was about eighteen.\nHis uncle used to thrash him in that garden up there 'cause it was back\nof the house where no one could see him. But folks could hear, and they\nsay it was awful sometimes hearing poor Henry plead with his uncle\nnot to kill him. But nobody dared interfere 'cause old Tom was such a\nreprobate he'd have been sure to get square with 'em some way. He burned\nthe barns of a man at Harbour Head who offended him. At last Henry died\nand his uncle and aunt give out he died in one of his fits and that was\nall anybody ever knowed, but everybody said Tom had just up and killed\nhim for keeps at last. And it wasn't long till it got around that Henry\nWALKED. That old garden was HA'NTED. He was heard there at nights,\nmoaning and crying. Old Tom and his wife got out--went out West and\nnever came back. The place got such a bad name nobody'd buy or rent it.\nThat's why it's all gone to ruin. That was thirty years ago, but Henry\nWarren's ghost ha'nts it yet.\"\n\n\"Do you believe that?\" asked Nan scornfully. \"_I_ don't.\"\n\n\"Well, GOOD people have seen him--and heard him.\" retorted Mary. \"They\nsay he appears and grovels on the ground and holds you by the legs and\ngibbers and moans like he did when he was alive. I thought of that as\nsoon as I seen that white thing in the bushes and thought if it caught\nme like that and moaned I'd drop down dead on the spot. So I cut and\nrun. It MIGHTN'T have been his ghost, but I wasn't going to take any\nchances with a ha'nt.\"\n\n\"It was likely old Mrs. Stimson's white calf,\" laughed Di. \"It pastures\nin that garden--I've seen it.\"\n\n\"Maybe so. But I'M not going home through the Bailey garden any more.\nHere's Jerry with a big string of trout and it's my turn to cook them.\nJem and Jerry both say I'm the best cook in the Glen. And Cornelia told\nme I could bring up this batch of cookies. I all but dropped them when I\nsaw Henry's ghost.\"\n\nJerry hooted when he heard the ghost story--which Mary repeated as she\nfried the fish, touching it up a trifle or so, since Walter had gone to\nhelp Faith to set the table. It made no impression on Jerry, but Faith\nand Una and Carl had been secretly much frightened, though they would\nnever have given in to it. It was all right as long as the others were\nwith them in the valley: but when the feast was over and the shadows\nfell they quaked with remembrance. Jerry went up to Ingleside with the\nBlythes to see Jem about something, and Mary Vance went around that way\nhome. So Faith and Una and Carl had to go back to the manse alone. They\nwalked very close together and gave the old Bailey garden a wide berth.\nThey did not believe that it was haunted, of course, but they would not\ngo near it for all that.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX. THE GHOST ON THE DYKE\n\nSomehow, Faith and Carl and Una could not shake off the hold which the\nstory of Henry Warren's ghost had taken upon their imaginations. They\nhad never believed in ghosts. Ghost tales they had heard a-plenty--Mary\nVance had told some far more blood-curdling than this; but those tales\nwere all of places and people and spooks far away and unknown. After the\nfirst half-awful, half-pleasant thrill of awe and terror they thought\nof them no more. But this story came home to them. The old Bailey garden\nwas almost at their very door--almost in their beloved Rainbow Valley.\nThey had passed and repassed it constantly; they had hunted for flowers\nin it; they had made short cuts through it when they wished to go\nstraight from the village to the valley. But never again! After the\nnight when Mary Vance told them its gruesome tale they would not have\ngone through or near it on pain of death. Death! What was death compared\nto the unearthly possibility of falling into the clutches of Henry\nWarren's grovelling ghost?\n\nOne warm July evening the three of them were sitting under the Tree\nLovers, feeling a little lonely. Nobody else had come near the valley\nthat evening. Jem Blythe was away in Charlottetown, writing on his\nentrance examinations. Jerry and Walter Blythe were off for a sail on\nthe harbour with old Captain Crawford. Nan and Di and Rilla and Shirley\nhad gone down the harbour road to visit Kenneth and Persis Ford, who had\ncome with their parents for a flying visit to the little old House of\nDreams. Nan had asked Faith to go with them, but Faith had declined. She\nwould never have admitted it, but she felt a little secret jealousy of\nPersis Ford, concerning whose wonderful beauty and city glamour she\nhad heard a great deal. No, she wasn't going to go down there and play\nsecond fiddle to anybody. She and Una took their story books to Rainbow\nValley and read, while Carl investigated bugs along the banks of the\nbrook, and all three were happy until they suddenly realized that it was\ntwilight and that the old Bailey garden was uncomfortably near by. Carl\ncame and sat down close to the girls. They all wished they had gone home\na little sooner, but nobody said anything.\n\nGreat, velvety, purple clouds heaped up in the west and spread over\nthe valley. There was no wind and everything was suddenly, strangely,\ndreadfully still. The marsh was full of thousands of fire-flies. Surely\nsome fairy parliament was being convened that night. Altogether, Rainbow\nValley was not a canny place just then.\n\nFaith looked fearfully up the valley to the old Bailey garden. Then,\nif anybody's blood ever did freeze, Faith Meredith's certainly froze at\nthat moment. The eyes of Carl and Una followed her entranced gaze and\nchills began gallopading up and down their spines also. For there, under\nthe big tamarack tree on the tumble-down, grass-grown dyke of the Bailey\ngarden, was something white--shapelessly white in the gathering gloom.\nThe three Merediths sat and gazed as if turned to stone.\n\n\"It's--it's the--calf,\" whispered Una at last.\n\n\"It's--too--big--for the calf,\" whispered Faith. Her mouth and lips were\nso dry she could hardly articulate the words.\n\nSuddenly Carl gasped,\n\n\"It's coming here.\"\n\nThe girls gave one last agonized glance. Yes, it was creeping down over\nthe dyke, as no calf ever did or could creep. Reason fled before sudden,\nover-mastering panic. For the moment every one of the trio was firmly\nconvinced that what they saw was Henry Warren's ghost. Carl sprang\nto his feet and bolted blindly. With a simultaneous shriek the girls\nfollowed him. Like mad creatures they tore up the hill, across the road\nand into the manse. They had left Aunt Martha sewing in the kitchen. She\nwas not there. They rushed to the study. It was dark and tenantless.\nAs with one impulse, they swung around and made for Ingleside--but not\nacross Rainbow Valley. Down the hill and through the Glen street they\nflew on the wings of their wild terror, Carl in the lead, Una bringing\nup the rear. Nobody tried to stop them, though everybody who saw them\nwondered what fresh devilment those manse youngsters were up to now. But\nat the gate of Ingleside they ran into Rosemary West, who had just been\nin for a moment to return some borrowed books.\n\nShe saw their ghastly faces and staring eyes. She realized that their\npoor little souls were wrung with some awful and real fear, whatever\nits cause. She caught Carl with one arm and Faith with the other. Una\nstumbled against her and held on desperately.\n\n\"Children, dear, what has happened?\" she said. \"What has frightened\nyou?\"\n\n\"Henry Warren's ghost,\" answered Carl, through his chattering teeth.\n\n\"Henry--Warren's--ghost!\" said amazed Rosemary, who had never heard the\nstory.\n\n\"Yes,\" sobbed Faith hysterically. \"It's there--on the Bailey dyke--we\nsaw it--and it started to--chase us.\"\n\nRosemary herded the three distracted creatures to the Ingleside veranda.\nGilbert and Anne were both away, having also gone to the House of\nDreams, but Susan appeared in the doorway, gaunt and practical and\nunghostlike.\n\n\"What is all this rumpus about?\" she inquired.\n\nAgain the children gasped out their awful tale, while Rosemary held them\nclose to her and soothed them with wordless comfort.\n\n\"Likely it was an owl,\" said Susan, unstirred.\n\nAn owl! The Meredith children never had any opinion of Susan's\nintelligence after that!\n\n\"It was bigger than a million owls,\" said Carl, sobbing--oh, how ashamed\nCarl was of that sobbing in after days--\"and it--it GROVELLED just as\nMary said--and it was crawling down over the dyke to get at us. Do owls\nCRAWL?\"\n\nRosemary looked at Susan.\n\n\"They must have seen something to frighten them so,\" she said.\n\n\"I will go and see,\" said Susan coolly. \"Now, children, calm yourselves.\nWhatever you have seen, it was not a ghost. As for poor Henry Warren,\nI feel sure he would be only too glad to rest quietly in his peaceful\ngrave once he got there. No fear of HIM venturing back, and that you may\ntie to. If you can make them see reason, Miss West, I will find out the\ntruth of the matter.\"\n\nSusan departed for Rainbow Valley, valiantly grasping a pitchfork which\nshe found leaning against the back fence where the doctor had been\nworking in his little hay-field. A pitchfork might not be of much use\nagainst \"ha'nts,\" but it was a comforting sort of weapon. There was\nnothing to be seen in Rainbow Valley when Susan reached it. No white\nvisitants appeared to be lurking in the shadowy, tangled old Bailey\ngarden. Susan marched boldly through it and beyond it, and rapped with\nher pitchfork on the door of the little cottage on the other side, where\nMrs. Stimson lived with her two daughters.\n\nBack at Ingleside Rosemary had succeeded in calming the children. They\nstill sobbed a little from shock, but they were beginning to feel a\nlurking and salutary suspicion that they had made dreadful geese\nof themselves. This suspicion became a certainty when Susan finally\nreturned.\n\n\"I have found out what your ghost was,\" she said, with a grim smile,\nsitting down on a rocker and fanning herself. \"Old Mrs. Stimson has had\na pair of factory cotton sheets bleaching in the Bailey garden for a\nweek. She spread them on the dyke under the tamarack tree because the\ngrass was clean and short there. This evening she went out to take them\nin. She had her knitting in her hands so she hung the sheets over her\nshoulders by way of carrying them. And then she must have dropped one of\nher needles and find it she could not and has not yet. But she went down\non her knees and crept about to hunt for it, and she was at that when\nshe heard awful yells down in the valley and saw the three children\ntearing up the hill past her. She thought they had been bit by something\nand it gave her poor old heart such a turn that she could not move or\nspeak, but just crouched there till they disappeared. Then she staggered\nback home and they have been applying stimulants to her ever since, and\nher heart is in a terrible condition and she says she will not get over\nthis fright all summer.\"\n\nThe Merediths sat, crimson with a shame that even Rosemary's\nunderstanding sympathy could not remove. They sneaked off home, met\nJerry at the manse gate and made remorseful confession. A session of the\nGood-Conduct Club was arranged for next morning.\n\n\"Wasn't Miss West sweet to us to-night?\" whispered Faith in bed.\n\n\"Yes,\" admitted Una. \"It is such a pity it changes people so much to be\nmade stepmothers.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it does,\" said Faith loyally.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI. CARL DOES PENANCE\n\n\"I don't see why we should be punished at all,\" said Faith, rather\nsulkily. \"We didn't do anything wrong. We couldn't help being\nfrightened. And it won't do father any harm. It was just an accident.\"\n\n\"You were cowards,\" said Jerry with judicial scorn, \"and you gave way to\nyour cowardice. That is why you should be punished. Everybody will laugh\nat you about this, and that is a disgrace to the family.\"\n\n\"If you knew how awful the whole thing was,\" said Faith with a shiver,\n\"you would think we had been punished enough already. I wouldn't go\nthrough it again for anything in the whole world.\"\n\n\"I believe you'd have run yourself if you'd been there,\" muttered Carl.\n\n\"From an old woman in a cotton sheet,\" mocked Jerry. \"Ho, ho, ho!\"\n\n\"It didn't look a bit like an old woman,\" cried Faith. \"It was just a\ngreat, big, white thing crawling about in the grass just as Mary Vance\nsaid Henry Warren did. It's all very fine for you to laugh, Jerry\nMeredith, but you'd have laughed on the other side of your mouth if\nyou'd been there. And how are we to be punished? _I_ don't think it's\nfair, but let's know what we have to do, Judge Meredith!\"\n\n\"The way I look at it,\" said Jerry, frowning, \"is that Carl was the most\nto blame. He bolted first, as I understand it. Besides, he was a boy,\nso he should have stood his ground to protect you girls, whatever the\ndanger was. You know that, Carl, don't you?\"\n\n\"I s'pose so,\" growled Carl shamefacedly.\n\n\"Very well. This is to be your punishment. To-night you'll sit on\nMr. Hezekiah Pollock's tombstone in the graveyard alone, until twelve\no'clock.\"\n\nCarl gave a little shudder. The graveyard was not so very far from the\nold Bailey garden. It would be a trying ordeal, but Carl was anxious to\nwipe out his disgrace and prove that he was not a coward after all.\n\n\"All right,\" he said sturdily. \"But how'll I know when it is twelve?\"\n\n\"The study windows are open and you'll hear the clock striking. And\nmind you that you are not to budge out of that graveyard until the last\nstroke. As for you girls, you've got to go without jam at supper for a\nweek.\"\n\nFaith and Una looked rather blank. They were inclined to think that even\nCarl's comparatively short though sharp agony was lighter punishment\nthan this long drawn-out ordeal. A whole week of soggy bread without\nthe saving grace of jam! But no shirking was permitted in the club. The\ngirls accepted their lot with such philosophy as they could summon up.\n\nThat night they all went to bed at nine, except Carl, who was already\nkeeping vigil on the tombstone. Una slipped in to bid him good night.\nHer tender heart was wrung with sympathy.\n\n\"Oh, Carl, are you much scared?\" she whispered.\n\n\"Not a bit,\" said Carl airily.\n\n\"I won't sleep a wink till after twelve,\" said Una. \"If you get lonesome\njust look up at our window and remember that I'm inside, awake, and\nthinking about you. That will be a little company, won't it?\"\n\n\"I'll be all right. Don't you worry about me,\" said Carl.\n\nBut in spite of his dauntless words Carl was a pretty lonely boy when\nthe lights went out in the manse. He had hoped his father would be in\nthe study as he so often was. He would not feel alone then. But that\nnight Mr. Meredith had been summoned to the fishing village at the\nharbour mouth to see a dying man. He would not likely be back until\nafter midnight. Carl must dree his weird alone.\n\nA Glen man went past carrying a lantern. The mysterious shadows caused\nby the lantern-light went hurtling madly over the graveyard like a dance\nof demons or witches. Then they passed and darkness fell again. One by\none the lights in the Glen went out. It was a very dark night, with a\ncloudy sky, and a raw east wind that was cold in spite of the calendar.\nFar away on the horizon was the low dim lustre of the Charlottetown\nlights. The wind wailed and sighed in the old fir-trees. Mr. Alec Davis'\ntall monument gleamed whitely through the gloom. The willow beside it\ntossed long, writhing arms spectrally. At times, the gyrations of its\nboughs made it seem as if the monument were moving, too.\n\nCarl curled himself up on the tombstone with his legs tucked under him.\nIt wasn't precisely pleasant to hang them over the edge of the stone.\nJust suppose--just suppose--bony hands should reach up out of Mr.\nPollock's grave under it and clutch him by the ankles. That had been one\nof Mary Vance's cheerful speculations one time when they had all been\nsitting there. It returned to haunt Carl now. He didn't believe those\nthings; he didn't even really believe in Henry Warren's ghost. As for\nMr. Pollock, he had been dead sixty years, so it wasn't likely he cared\nwho sat on his tombstone now. But there is something very strange and\nterrible in being awake when all the rest of the world is asleep. You\nare alone then with nothing but your own feeble personality to pit\nagainst the mighty principalities and powers of darkness. Carl was only\nten and the dead were all around him--and he wished, oh, he wished that\nthe clock would strike twelve. Would it NEVER strike twelve? Surely Aunt\nMartha must have forgotten to wind it.\n\nAnd then it struck eleven--only eleven! He must stay yet another hour in\nthat grim place. If only there were a few friendly stars to be seen! The\ndarkness was so thick it seemed to press against his face. There was\na sound as of stealthy passing footsteps all over the graveyard. Carl\nshivered, partly with prickling terror, partly with real cold.\n\nThen it began to rain--a chill, penetrating drizzle. Carl's thin little\ncotton blouse and shirt were soon wet through. He felt chilled to the\nbone. He forgot mental terrors in his physical discomfort. But he must\nstay there till twelve--he was punishing himself and he was on his\nhonour. Nothing had been said about rain--but it did not make any\ndifference. When the study clock finally struck twelve a drenched little\nfigure crept stiffly down off Mr. Pollock's tombstone, made its way into\nthe manse and upstairs to bed. Carl's teeth were chattering. He thought\nhe would never get warm again.\n\nHe was warm enough when morning came. Jerry gave one startled look at\nhis crimson face and then rushed to call his father. Mr. Meredith came\nhurriedly, his own face ivory white from the pallor of his long night\nvigil by a death bed. He had not got home until daylight. He bent over\nhis little lad anxiously.\n\n\"Carl, are you sick?\" he said.\n\n\"That--tombstone--over here,\" said Carl, \"it's--moving--about--it's\ncoming--at--me--keep it--away--please.\"\n\nMr. Meredith rushed to the telephone. In ten minutes Dr. Blythe was\nat the manse. Half an hour later a wire was sent to town for a trained\nnurse, and all the Glen knew that Carl Meredith was very ill with\npneumonia and that Dr. Blythe had been seen to shake his head.\n\nGilbert shook his head more than once in the fortnight that followed.\nCarl developed double pneumonia. There was one night when Mr. Meredith\npaced his study floor, and Faith and Una huddled in their bedroom and\ncried, and Jerry, wild with remorse, refused to budge from the floor of\nthe hall outside Carl's door. Dr. Blythe and the nurse never left the\nbedside. They fought death gallantly until the red dawn and they won\nthe victory. Carl rallied and passed the crisis in safety. The news was\nphoned about the waiting Glen and people found out how much they really\nloved their minister and his children.\n\n\"I haven't had one decent night's sleep since I heard the child was\nsick,\" Miss Cornelia told Anne, \"and Mary Vance has cried until those\nqueer eyes of hers looked like burnt holes in a blanket. Is it true that\nCarl got pneumonia from straying out in the graveyard that wet night for\na dare?\"\n\n\"No. He was staying there to punish himself for cowardice in that affair\nof the Warren ghost. It seems they have a club for bringing themselves\nup, and they punish themselves when they do wrong. Jerry told Mr.\nMeredith all about it.\"\n\n\"The poor little souls,\" said Miss Cornelia.\n\nCarl got better rapidly, for the congregation took enough nourishing\nthings to the manse to furnish forth a hospital. Norman Douglas drove\nup every evening with a dozen fresh eggs and a jar of Jersey cream.\nSometimes he stayed an hour and bellowed arguments on predestination\nwith Mr. Meredith in the study; oftener he drove on up to the hill that\noverlooked the Glen.\n\nWhen Carl was able to go again to Rainbow Valley they had a special\nfeast in his honour and the doctor came down and helped them with the\nfireworks. Mary Vance was there, too, but she did not tell any ghost\nstories. Miss Cornelia had given her a talking on that subject which\nMary would not forget in a hurry.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII. TWO STUBBORN PEOPLE\n\nRosemary West, on her way home from a music lesson at Ingleside, turned\naside to the hidden spring in Rainbow Valley. She had not been there all\nsummer; the beautiful little spot had no longer any allurement for\nher. The spirit of her young lover never came to the tryst now; and the\nmemories connected with John Meredith were too painful and poignant. But\nshe had happened to glance backward up the valley and had seen Norman\nDouglas vaulting as airily as a stripling over the old stone dyke of the\nBailey garden and thought he was on his way up the hill. If he overtook\nher she would have to walk home with him and she was not going to do\nthat. So she slipped at once behind the maples of the spring, hoping he\nhad not seen her and would pass on.\n\nBut Norman had seen her and, what was more, was in pursuit of her. He\nhad been wanting for some time to have talk with Rosemary, but she had\nalways, so it seemed, avoided him. Rosemary had never, at any time,\nliked Norman Douglas very well. His bluster, his temper, his noisy\nhilarity, had always antagonized her. Long ago she had often wondered\nhow Ellen could possibly be attracted to him. Norman Douglas was\nperfectly aware of her dislike and he chuckled over it. It never worried\nNorman if people did not like him. It did not even make him dislike them\nin return, for he took it as a kind of extorted compliment. He thought\nRosemary a fine girl, and he meant to be an excellent, generous\nbrother-in-law to her. But before he could be her brother-in-law he had\nto have a talk with her, so, having seen her leaving Ingleside as he\nstood in the doorway of a Glen store, he had straightway plunged into\nthe valley to overtake her.\n\nRosemary was sitting pensively on the maple seat where John Meredith\nhad been sitting on that evening nearly a year ago. The tiny spring\nshimmered and dimpled under its fringe of ferns. Ruby-red gleams of\nsunset fell through the arching boughs. A tall clump of perfect asters\ngrew at her side. The little spot was as dreamy and witching and evasive\nas any retreat of fairies and dryads in ancient forests. Into it Norman\nDouglas bounced, scattering and annihilating its charm in a moment. His\npersonality seemed to swallow the place up. There was simply nothing\nthere but Norman Douglas, big, red-bearded, complacent.\n\n\"Good evening,\" said Rosemary coldly, standing up.\n\n\"'Evening, girl. Sit down again--sit down again. I want to have a talk\nwith you. Bless the girl, what's she looking at me like that for? I\ndon't want to eat you--I've had my supper. Sit down and be civil.\"\n\n\"I can hear what you have to say quite as well here,\" said Rosemary.\n\n\"So you can, girl, if you use your ears. I only wanted you to be\ncomfortable. You look so durned uncomfortable, standing there. Well,\nI'LL sit anyway.\"\n\nNorman accordingly sat down in the very place John Meredith had once\nsat. The contrast was so ludicrous that Rosemary was afraid she would\ngo off into a peal of hysterical laughter over it. Norman cast his hat\naside, placed his huge, red hands on his knees, and looked up at her\nwith his eyes a-twinkle.\n\n\"Come, girl, don't be so stiff,\" he said, ingratiatingly. When he liked\nhe could be very ingratiating. \"Let's have a reasonable, sensible,\nfriendly chat. There's something I want to ask you. Ellen says she\nwon't, so it's up to me to do it.\"\n\nRosemary looked down at the spring, which seemed to have shrunk to the\nsize of a dewdrop. Norman gazed at her in despair.\n\n\"Durn it all, you might help a fellow out a bit,\" he burst forth.\n\n\"What is it you want me to help you say?\" asked Rosemary scornfully.\n\n\"You know as well as I do, girl. Don't be putting on your tragedy airs.\nNo wonder Ellen was scared to ask you. Look here, girl, Ellen and I want\nto marry each other. That's plain English, isn't it? Got that? And Ellen\nsays she can't unless you give her back some tom-fool promise she made.\nCome now, will you do it? Will you do it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Rosemary.\n\nNorman bounced up and seized her reluctant hand.\n\n\"Good! I knew you would--I told Ellen you would. I knew it would only\ntake a minute. Now, girl, you go home and tell Ellen, and we'll have a\nwedding in a fortnight and you'll come and live with us. We shan't leave\nyou to roost on that hill-top like a lonely crow--don't you worry. I\nknow you hate me, but, Lord, it'll be great fun living with some one\nthat hates me. Life'll have some spice in it after this. Ellen will\nroast me and you'll freeze me. I won't have a dull moment.\"\n\nRosemary did not condescend to tell him that nothing would ever induce\nher to live in his house. She let him go striding back to the Glen,\noozing delight and complacency, and she walked slowly up the hill\nhome. She had known this was coming ever since she had returned from\nKingsport, and found Norman Douglas established as a frequent evening\ncaller. His name was never mentioned between her and Ellen, but the very\navoidance of it was significant. It was not in Rosemary's nature to\nfeel bitter, or she would have felt very bitter. She was coldly civil to\nNorman, and she made no difference in any way with Ellen. But Ellen had\nnot found much comfort in her second courtship.\n\nShe was in the garden, attended by St. George, when Rosemary came home.\nThe two sisters met in the dahlia walk. St. George sat down on the\ngravel walk between them and folded his glossy black tail gracefully\naround his white paws, with all the indifference of a well-fed,\nwell-bred, well-groomed cat.\n\n\"Did you ever see such dahlias?\" demanded Ellen proudly. \"They are just\nthe finest we've ever had.\"\n\nRosemary had never cared for dahlias. Their presence in the garden was\nher concession to Ellen's taste. She noticed one huge mottled one of\ncrimson and yellow that lorded it over all the others.\n\n\"That dahlia,\" she said, pointing to it, \"is exactly like Norman\nDouglas. It might easily be his twin brother.\"\n\nEllen's dark-browed face flushed. She admired the dahlia in question,\nbut she knew Rosemary did not, and that no compliment was intended.\nBut she dared not resent Rosemary's speech--poor Ellen dared not\nresent anything just then. And it was the first time Rosemary had ever\nmentioned Norman's name to her. She felt that this portended something.\n\n\"I met Norman Douglas in the valley,\" said Rosemary, looking straight at\nher sister, \"and he told me you and he wanted to be married--if I would\ngive you permission.\"\n\n\"Yes? What did you say?\" asked Ellen, trying to speak naturally and\noff-handedly, and failing completely. She could not meet Rosemary's\neyes. She looked down at St. George's sleek back and felt horribly\nafraid. Rosemary had either said she would or she wouldn't. If she would\nEllen would feel so ashamed and remorseful that she would be a very\nuncomfortable bride-elect; and if she wouldn't--well, Ellen had once\nlearned to live without Norman Douglas, but she had forgotten the lesson\nand felt that she could never learn it again.\n\n\"I said that as far as I was concerned you were at full liberty to marry\neach other as soon as you liked,\" said Rosemary.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Ellen, still looking at St. George.\n\nRosemary's face softened.\n\n\"I hope you'll be happy, Ellen,\" she said gently.\n\n\"Oh, Rosemary,\" Ellen looked up in distress, \"I'm so ashamed--I don't\ndeserve it--after all I said to you--\"\n\n\"We won't speak about that,\" said Rosemary hurriedly and decidedly.\n\n\"But--but,\" persisted Ellen, \"you are free now, too--and it's not too\nlate--John Meredith--\"\n\n\"Ellen West!\" Rosemary had a little spark of temper under all her\nsweetness and it flashed forth now in her blue eyes. \"Have you quite\nlost your senses in EVERY respect? Do you suppose for an instant that\n_I_ am going to go to John Meredith and say meekly, 'Please, sir, I've\nchanged my mind and please, sir, I hope you haven't changed yours.' Is\nthat what you want me to do?\"\n\n\"No--no--but a little--encouragement--he would come back--\"\n\n\"Never. He despises me--and rightly. No more of this, Ellen. I bear you\nno grudge--marry whom you like. But no meddling in my affairs.\"\n\n\"Then you must come and live with me,\" said Ellen. \"I shall not leave\nyou here alone.\"\n\n\"Do you really think that I would go and live in Norman Douglas's\nhouse?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" cried Ellen, half angrily, despite her humiliation.\n\nRosemary began to laugh.\n\n\"Ellen, I thought you had a sense of humour. Can you see me doing it?\"\n\n\"I don't see why you wouldn't. His house is big enough--you'd have your\nshare of it to yourself--he wouldn't interfere.\"\n\n\"Ellen, the thing is not to be thought of. Don't bring this up again.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Ellen coldly, and determinedly, \"I shall not marry him. I\nshall not leave you here alone. That is all there is to be said about\nit.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Ellen.\"\n\n\"It is not nonsense. It is my firm decision. It would be absurd for you\nto think of living here by yourself--a mile from any other house. If you\nwon't come with me I'll stay with you. Now, we won't argue the matter,\nso don't try.\"\n\n\"I shall leave Norman to do the arguing,\" said Rosemary.\n\n\"I'LL deal with Norman. I can manage HIM. I would never have asked\nyou to give me back my promise--never--but I had to tell Norman why I\ncouldn't marry him and he said HE would ask you. I couldn't prevent him.\nYou need not suppose you are the only person in the world who possesses\nself-respect. I never dreamed of marrying and leaving you here alone.\nAnd you'll find I can be as determined as yourself.\"\n\nRosemary turned away and went into the house, with a shrug of her\nshoulders. Ellen looked down at St. George, who had never blinked an\neyelash or stirred a whisker during the whole interview.\n\n\"St. George, this world would be a dull place without the men, I'll\nadmit, but I'm almost tempted to wish there wasn't one of 'em in it.\nLook at the trouble and bother they've made right here, George--torn our\nhappy old life completely up by the roots, Saint. John Meredith began it\nand Norman Douglas has finished it. And now both of them have to go into\nlimbo. Norman is the only man I ever met who agrees with me that\nthe Kaiser of Germany is the most dangerous creature alive on this\nearth--and I can't marry this sensible person because my sister is\nstubborn and I'm stubborner. Mark my words, St. George, the minister\nwould come back if she raised her little finger. But she won't\nGeorge--she'll never do it--she won't even crook it--and I don't dare\nmeddle, Saint. I won't sulk, George; Rosemary didn't sulk, so I'm\ndetermined I won't either, Saint; Norman will tear up the turf, but the\nlong and short of it is, St. George, that all of us old fools must just\nstop thinking of marrying. Well, well, 'despair is a free man, hope is\na slave,' Saint. So now come into the house, George, and I'll solace you\nwith a saucerful of cream. Then there will be one happy and contented\ncreature on this hill at least.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII. CARL IS--NOT--WHIPPED\n\n\"There is something I think I ought to tell you,\" said Mary Vance\nmysteriously.\n\nShe and Faith and Una were walking arm in arm through the village,\nhaving foregathered at Mr. Flagg's store. Una and Faith exchanged looks\nwhich said, \"NOW something disagreeable is coming.\" When Mary Vance\nthought she ought to tell them things there was seldom much pleasure in\nthe hearing. They often wondered why they kept on liking Mary Vance--for\nlike her they did, in spite of everything. To be sure, she was generally\na stimulating and agreeable companion. If only she would not have those\nconvictions that it was her duty to tell them things!\n\n\"Do you know that Rosemary West won't marry your pa because she thinks\nyou are such a wild lot? She's afraid she couldn't bring you up right\nand so she turned him down.\"\n\nUna's heart thrilled with secret exultation. She was very glad to\nhear that Miss West would not marry her father. But Faith was rather\ndisappointed.\n\n\"How do you know?\" she asked.\n\n\"Oh, everybody's saying it. I heard Mrs. Elliott talking it over with\nMrs. Doctor. They thought I was too far away to hear, but I've got ears\nlike a cat's. Mrs. Elliott said she hadn't a doubt that Rosemary was\nafraid to try stepmothering you because you'd got such a reputation.\nYour pa never goes up the hill now. Neither does Norman Douglas. Folks\nsay Ellen has jilted him just to get square with him for jilting her\nages ago. But Norman is going about declaring he'll get her yet. And\nI think you ought to know you've spoiled your pa's match and _I_ think\nit's a pity, for he's bound to marry somebody before long, and Rosemary\nWest would have been the best wife _I_ know of for him.\"\n\n\"You told me all stepmothers were cruel and wicked,\" said Una.\n\n\"Oh--well,\" said Mary rather confusedly, \"they're mostly awful cranky, I\nknow. But Rosemary West couldn't be very mean to any one. I tell you if\nyour pa turns round and marries Emmeline Drew you'll wish you'd behaved\nyourselves better and not frightened Rosemary out of it. It's awful that\nyou've got such a reputation that no decent woman'll marry your pa on\naccount of you. Of course, _I_ know that half the yarns that are told\nabout you ain't true. But give a dog a bad name. Why, some folks are\nsaying that it was Jerry and Carl that threw the stones through Mrs.\nStimson's window the other night when it was really them two Boyd boys.\nBut I'm afraid it was Carl that put the eel in old Mrs. Carr's buggy,\nthough I said at first I wouldn't believe it until I'd better proof than\nold Kitty Alec's word. I told Mrs. Elliott so right to her face.\"\n\n\"What did Carl do?\" cried Faith.\n\n\"Well, they say--now, mind, I'm only telling you what people say--so\nthere's no use in your blaming me for it--that Carl and a lot of other\nboys were fishing eels over the bridge one evening last week. Mrs. Carr\ndrove past in that old rattletrap buggy of hers with the open back. And\nCarl he just up and threw a big eel into the back. When poor old Mrs.\nCarr was driving up the hill by Ingleside that eel came squirming out\nbetween her feet. She thought it was a snake and she just give one awful\nscreech and stood up and jumped clean over the wheels. The horse bolted,\nbut it went home and no damage was done. But Mrs. Carr jarred her legs\nmost terrible, and has had nervous spasms ever since whenever she thinks\nof the eel. Say, it was a rotten trick to play on the poor old soul.\nShe's a decent body, if she is as queer as Dick's hat band.\"\n\nFaith and Una looked at each other again. This was a matter for the\nGood-Conduct Club. They would not talk it over with Mary.\n\n\"There goes your pa,\" said Mary as Mr. Meredith passed them, \"and never\nseeing us no more'n if we weren't here. Well, I'm getting so's I don't\nmind it. But there are folks who do.\"\n\nMr. Meredith had not seen them, but he was not walking along in his\nusual dreamy and abstracted fashion. He strode up the hill in agitation\nand distress. Mrs. Alec Davis had just told him the story of Carl and\nthe eel. She had been very indignant about it. Old Mrs. Carr was her\nthird cousin. Mr. Meredith was more than indignant. He was hurt and\nshocked. He had not thought Carl would do anything like this. He was not\ninclined to be hard on pranks of heedlessness or forgetfulness, but\nTHIS was different. THIS had a nasty tang in it. When he reached home he\nfound Carl on the lawn, patiently studying the habits and customs of a\ncolony of wasps. Calling him into the study Mr. Meredith confronted him,\nwith a sterner face than any of his children had ever seen before, and\nasked him if the story were true.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Carl, flushing, but meeting his father's eyes bravely.\n\nMr. Meredith groaned. He had hoped that there had been at least\nexaggeration.\n\n\"Tell me the whole matter,\" he said.\n\n\"The boys were fishing for eels over the bridge,\" said Carl. \"Link Drew\nhad caught a whopper--I mean an awful big one--the biggest eel I ever\nsaw. He caught it right at the start and it had been lying in his basket\na long time, still as still. I thought it was dead, honest I did. Then\nold Mrs. Carr drove over the bridge and she called us all young varmints\nand told us to go home. And we hadn't said a word to her, father, truly.\nSo when she drove back again, after going to the store, the boys dared\nme to put Link's eel in her buggy. I thought it was so dead it couldn't\nhurt her and I threw it in. Then the eel came to life on the hill and\nwe heard her scream and saw her jump out. I was awful sorry. That's all,\nfather.\"\n\nIt was not quite as bad as Mr. Meredith had feared, but it was quite bad\nenough. \"I must punish you, Carl,\" he said sorrowfully.\n\n\"Yes, I know, father.\"\n\n\"I--I must whip you.\"\n\nCarl winced. He had never been whipped. Then, seeing how badly his\nfather felt, he said cheerfully,\n\n\"All right, father.\"\n\nMr. Meredith misunderstood his cheerfulness and thought him insensible.\nHe told Carl to come to the study after supper, and when the boy had\ngone out he flung himself into his chair and groaned again. He dreaded\nthe evening sevenfold more than Carl did. The poor minister did not even\nknow what he should whip his boy with. What was used to whip boys? Rods?\nCanes? No, that would be too brutal. A timber switch, then? And he, John\nMeredith, must hie him to the woods and cut one. It was an abominable\nthought. Then a picture presented itself unbidden to his mind. He saw\nMrs. Carr's wizened, nut-cracker little face at the appearance of that\nreviving eel--he saw her sailing witch-like over the buggy wheels.\nBefore he could prevent himself the minister laughed. Then he was angry\nwith himself and angrier still with Carl. He would get that switch at\nonce--and it must not be too limber, after all.\n\nCarl was talking the matter over in the graveyard with Faith and Una,\nwho had just come home. They were horrified at the idea of his being\nwhipped--and by father, who had never done such a thing! But they agreed\nsoberly that it was just.\n\n\"You know it was a dreadful thing to do,\" sighed Faith. \"And you never\nowned up in the club.\"\n\n\"I forgot,\" said Carl. \"Besides, I didn't think any harm came of it.\nI didn't know she jarred her legs. But I'm to be whipped and that will\nmake things square.\"\n\n\"Will it hurt--very much?\" said Una, slipping her hand into Carl's.\n\n\"Oh, not so much, I guess,\" said Carl gamely. \"Anyhow, I'm not going to\ncry, no matter how much it hurts. It would make father feel so bad, if\nI did. He's all cut up now. I wish I could whip myself hard enough and\nsave him doing it.\"\n\nAfter supper, at which Carl had eaten little and Mr. Meredith nothing at\nall, both went silently into the study. The switch lay on the table. Mr.\nMeredith had had a bad time getting a switch to suit him. He cut one,\nthen felt it was too slender. Carl had done a really indefensible thing.\nThen he cut another--it was far too thick. After all, Carl had thought\nthe eel was dead. The third one suited him better; but as he picked it\nup from the table it seemed very thick and heavy--more like a stick than\na switch.\n\n\"Hold out your hand,\" he said to Carl.\n\nCarl threw back his head and held out his hand unflinchingly. But he was\nnot very old and he could not quite keep a little fear out of his eyes.\nMr. Meredith looked down into those eyes--why, they were Cecilia's\neyes--her very eyes--and in them was the selfsame expression he had once\nseen in Cecilia's eyes when she had come to him to tell him something\nshe had been a little afraid to tell him. Here were her eyes in Carl's\nlittle, white face--and six weeks ago he had thought, through one\nendless, terrible night, that his little lad was dying.\n\nJohn Meredith threw down the switch.\n\n\"Go,\" he said, \"I cannot whip you.\"\n\nCarl fled to the graveyard, feeling that the look on his father's face\nwas worse than any whipping.\n\n\"Is it over so soon?\" asked Faith. She and Una had been holding hands\nand setting teeth on the Pollock tombstone.\n\n\"He--he didn't whip me at all,\" said Carl with a sob, \"and--I wish he\nhad--and he's in there, feeling just awful.\"\n\nUna slipped away. Her heart yearned to comfort her father. As\nnoiselessly as a little gray mouse she opened the study door and crept\nin. The room was dark with twilight. Her father was sitting at his desk.\nHis back was towards her--his head was in his hands. He was talking to\nhimself--broken, anguished words--but Una heard--heard and understood,\nwith the sudden illumination that comes to sensitive, unmothered\nchildren. As silently as she had come in she slipped out and closed the\ndoor. John Meredith went on talking out his pain in what he deemed his\nundisturbed solitude.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV. UNA VISITS THE HILL\n\nUna went upstairs. Carl and Faith were already on their way through the\nearly moonlight to Rainbow Valley, having heard therefrom the elfin lilt\nof Jerry's jews-harp and having guessed that the Blythes were there and\nfun afoot. Una had no wish to go. She sought her own room first where\nshe sat down on her bed and had a little cry. She did not want anybody\nto come in her dear mother's place. She did not want a stepmother\nwho would hate her and make her father hate her. But father was so\ndesperately unhappy--and if she could do any anything to make him\nhappier she MUST do it. There was only one thing she could do--and she\nhad known the moment she had left the study that she must do it. But it\nwas a very hard thing to do.\n\nAfter Una cried her heart out she wiped her eyes and went to the spare\nroom. It was dark and rather musty, for the blind had not been drawn\nup nor the window opened for a long time. Aunt Martha was no fresh-air\nfiend. But as nobody ever thought of shutting a door in the manse this\ndid not matter so much, save when some unfortunate minister came to stay\nall night and was compelled to breathe the spare room atmosphere.\n\nThere was a closet in the spare room and far back in the closet a gray\nsilk dress was hanging. Una went into the closet and shut the door, went\ndown on her knees and pressed her face against the soft silken folds.\nIt had been her mother's wedding-dress. It was still full of a sweet,\nfaint, haunting perfume, like lingering love. Una always felt very close\nto her mother there--as if she were kneeling at her feet with head in\nher lap. She went there once in a long while when life was TOO hard.\n\n\"Mother,\" she whispered to the gray silk gown, \"_I_ will never forget\nyou, mother, and I'll ALWAYS love you best. But I have to do it, mother,\nbecause father is so very unhappy. I know you wouldn't want him to be\nunhappy. And I will be very good to her, mother, and try to love her,\neven if she is like Mary Vance said stepmothers always were.\"\n\nUna carried some fine, spiritual strength away from her secret shrine.\nShe slept peacefully that night with the tear stains still glistening on\nher sweet, serious, little face.\n\nThe next afternoon she put on her best dress and hat. They were shabby\nenough. Every other little girl in the Glen had new clothes that summer\nexcept Faith and Una. Mary Vance had a lovely dress of white embroidered\nlawn, with scarlet silk sash and shoulder bows. But to-day Una did not\nmind her shabbiness. She only wanted to be very neat. She washed her\nface carefully. She brushed her black hair until it was as smooth as\nsatin. She tied her shoelaces carefully, having first sewed up two runs\nin her one pair of good stockings. She would have liked to black her\nshoes, but she could not find any blacking. Finally, she slipped away\nfrom the manse, down through Rainbow Valley, up through the whispering\nwoods, and out to the road that ran past the house on the hill. It was\nquite a long walk and Una was tired and warm when she got there.\n\nShe saw Rosemary West sitting under a tree in the garden and stole past\nthe dahlia beds to her. Rosemary had a book in her lap, but she was\ngazing afar across the harbour and her thoughts were sorrowful enough.\nLife had not been pleasant lately in the house on the hill. Ellen had\nnot sulked--Ellen had been a brick. But things can be felt that\nare never said and at times the silence between the two women was\nintolerably eloquent. All the many familiar things that had once\nmade life sweet had a flavour of bitterness now. Norman Douglas made\nperiodical irruptions also, bullying and coaxing Ellen by turns. It\nwould end, Rosemary believed, by his dragging Ellen off with him some\nday, and Rosemary felt that she would be almost glad when it happened.\nExistence would be horribly lonely then, but it would be no longer\ncharged with dynamite.\n\nShe was roused from her unpleasant reverie by a timid little touch on\nher shoulder. Turning, she saw Una Meredith.\n\n\"Why, Una, dear, did you walk up here in all this heat?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Una, \"I came to--I came to--\"\n\nBut she found it very hard to say what she had come to do. Her voice\nfailed--her eyes filled with tears.\n\n\"Why, Una, little girl, what is the trouble? Don't be afraid to tell\nme.\"\n\nRosemary put her arm around the thin little form and drew the child\nclose to her. Her eyes were very beautiful--her touch so tender that Una\nfound courage.\n\n\"I came--to ask you--to marry father,\" she gasped.\n\nRosemary was silent for a moment from sheer dumbfounderment. She stared\nat Una blankly.\n\n\"Oh, don't be angry, please, dear Miss West,\" said Una, pleadingly. \"You\nsee, everybody is saying that you wouldn't marry father because we are\nso bad. He is VERY unhappy about it. So I thought I would come and tell\nyou that we are never bad ON PURPOSE. And if you will only marry father\nwe will all try to be good and do just what you tell us. I'm SURE you\nwon't have any trouble with us. PLEASE, Miss West.\"\n\nRosemary had been thinking rapidly. Gossiping surmise, she saw, had\nput this mistaken idea into Una's mind. She must be perfectly frank and\nsincere with the child.\n\n\"Una, dear,\" she said softly. \"It isn't because of you poor little souls\nthat I cannot be your father's wife. I never thought of such a thing.\nYou are not bad--I never supposed you were. There--there was another\nreason altogether, Una.\"\n\n\"Don't you like father?\" asked Una, lifting reproachful eyes. \"Oh,\nMiss West, you don't know how nice he is. I'm sure he'd make you a GOOD\nhusband.\"\n\nEven in the midst of her perplexity and distress Rosemary couldn't help\na twisted, little smile.\n\n\"Oh, don't laugh, Miss West,\" Una cried passionately. \"Father feels\nDREADFUL about it.\"\n\n\"I think you're mistaken, dear,\" said Rosemary.\n\n\"I'm not. I'm SURE I'm not. Oh, Miss West, father was going to whip Carl\nyesterday--Carl had been naughty--and father couldn't do it because you\nsee he had no PRACTICE in whipping. So when Carl came out and told us\nfather felt so bad, I slipped into the study to see if I could help\nhim--he LIKES me to comfort him, Miss West--and he didn't hear me come\nin and I heard what he was saying. I'll tell you, Miss West, if you'll\nlet me whisper it in your ear.\"\n\nUna whispered earnestly. Rosemary's face turned crimson. So John\nMeredith still cared. HE hadn't changed his mind. And he must care\nintensely if he had said that--care more than she had ever supposed he\ndid. She sat still for a moment, stroking Una's hair. Then she said,\n\n\"Will you take a little letter from me to your father, Una?\"\n\n\"Oh, are you going to marry him, Miss West?\" asked Una eagerly.\n\n\"Perhaps--if he really wants me to,\" said Rosemary, blushing again.\n\n\"I'm glad--I'm glad,\" said Una bravely. Then she looked up, with\nquivering lips. \"Oh, Miss West, you won't turn father against us--you\nwon't make him hate us, will you?\" she said beseechingly.\n\nRosemary stared again.\n\n\"Una Meredith! Do you think I would do such a thing? Whatever put such\nan idea into your head?\"\n\n\"Mary Vance said stepmothers were all like that--and that they all hated\ntheir stepchildren and made their father hate them--she said they just\ncouldn't help it--just being stepmothers made them like that\"--\n\n\"You poor child! And yet you came up here and asked me to marry your\nfather because you wanted to make him happy? You're a darling--a\nheroine--as Ellen would say, you're a brick. Now listen to me, very\nclosely, dearest. Mary Vance is a silly little girl who doesn't know\nvery much and she is dreadfully mistaken about some things. I would\nnever dream of trying to turn your father against you. I would love\nyou all dearly. I don't want to take your own mother's place--she must\nalways have that in your hearts. But neither have I any intention of\nbeing a stepmother. I want to be your friend and helper and CHUM. Don't\nyou think that would be nice, Una--if you and Faith and Carl and Jerry\ncould just think of me as a good jolly chum--a big older sister?\"\n\n\"Oh, it would be lovely,\" cried Una, with a transfigured face. She flung\nher arms impulsively round Rosemary's neck. She was so happy that she\nfelt as if she could fly on wings.\n\n\"Do the others--do Faith and the boys have the same idea you had about\nstepmothers?\"\n\n\"No. Faith never believed Mary Vance. I was dreadfully foolish to\nbelieve her, either. Faith loves you already--she has loved you ever\nsince poor Adam was eaten. And Jerry and Carl will think it is jolly.\nOh, Miss West, when you come to live with us, will you--could you--teach\nme to cook--a little--and sew--and--and--and do things? I don't know\nanything. I won't be much trouble--I'll try to learn fast.\"\n\n\"Darling, I'll teach you and help you all I can. Now, you won't say\na word to anybody about this, will you--not even to Faith, until your\nfather himself tells you you may? And you'll stay and have tea with me?\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you--but--but--I think I'd rather go right back and take\nthe letter to father,\" faltered Una. \"You see, he'll be glad that much\nSOONER, Miss West.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Rosemary. She went to the house, wrote a note and gave\nit to Una. When that small damsel had run off, a palpitating bundle of\nhappiness, Rosemary went to Ellen, who was shelling peas on the back\nporch.\n\n\"Ellen,\" she said, \"Una Meredith has just been here to ask me to marry\nher father.\"\n\nEllen looked up and read her sister's face.\n\n\"And you're going to?\" she said.\n\n\"It's quite likely.\"\n\nEllen went on shelling peas for a few minutes. Then she suddenly put her\nhands up to her own face. There were tears in her black-browed eyes.\n\n\"I--I hope we'll all be happy,\" she said between a sob and a laugh.\n\nDown at the manse Una Meredith, warm, rosy, triumphant, marched boldly\ninto her father's study and laid a letter on the desk before him. His\npale face flushed as he saw the clear, fine handwriting he knew so well.\nHe opened the letter. It was very short--but he shed twenty years as he\nread it. Rosemary asked him if he could meet her that evening at sunset\nby the spring in Rainbow Valley.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV. \"LET THE PIPER COME\"\n\n\"And so,\" said Miss Cornelia, \"the double wedding is to be sometime\nabout the middle of this month.\"\n\nThere was a faint chill in the air of the early September evening, so\nAnne had lighted her ever ready fire of driftwood in the big living\nroom, and she and Miss Cornelia basked in its fairy flicker.\n\n\"It is so delightful--especially in regard to Mr. Meredith and\nRosemary,\" said Anne. \"I'm as happy in the thought of it, as I was when\nI was getting married myself. I felt exactly like a bride again last\nevening when I was up on the hill seeing Rosemary's trousseau.\"\n\n\"They tell me her things are fine enough for a princess,\" said Susan\nfrom a shadowy corner where she was cuddling her brown boy. \"I have\nbeen invited up to see them also and I intend to go some evening. I\nunderstand that Rosemary is to wear white silk and a veil, but Ellen is\nto be married in navy blue. I have no doubt, Mrs. Dr. dear, that that is\nvery sensible of her, but for my own part I have always felt that if I\nwere ever married _I_ would prefer the white and the veil, as being more\nbride-like.\"\n\nA vision of Susan in \"white and a veil\" presented itself before Anne's\ninner vision and was almost too much for her.\n\n\"As for Mr. Meredith,\" said Miss Cornelia, \"even his engagement has\nmade a different man of him. He isn't half so dreamy and absent-minded,\nbelieve me. I was so relieved when I heard that he had decided to close\nthe manse and let the children visit round while he was away on his\nhoneymoon. If he had left them and old Aunt Martha there alone for a\nmonth I should have expected to wake every morning and see the place\nburned down.\"\n\n\"Aunt Martha and Jerry are coming here,\" said Anne. \"Carl is going to\nElder Clow's. I haven't heard where the girls are going.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm going to take them,\" said Miss Cornelia. \"Of course, I was glad\nto, but Mary would have given me no peace till I asked them any way. The\nLadies' Aid is going to clean the manse from top to bottom before the\nbride and groom come back, and Norman Douglas has arranged to fill the\ncellar with vegetables. Nobody ever saw or heard anything quite like\nNorman Douglas these days, believe ME. He's so tickled that he's\ngoing to marry Ellen West after wanting her all his life. If _I_ was\nEllen--but then, I'm not, and if she is satisfied I can very well be. I\nheard her say years ago when she was a schoolgirl that she didn't want\na tame puppy for a husband. There's nothing tame about Norman, believe\nME.\"\n\nThe sun was setting over Rainbow Valley. The pond was wearing a\nwonderful tissue of purple and gold and green and crimson. A faint blue\nhaze rested on the eastern hill, over which a great, pale, round moon\nwas just floating up like a silver bubble.\n\nThey were all there, squatted in the little open glade--Faith and Una,\nJerry and Carl, Jem and Walter, Nan and Di, and Mary Vance. They had\nbeen having a special celebration, for it would be Jem's last evening in\nRainbow Valley. On the morrow he would leave for Charlottetown to attend\nQueen's Academy. Their charmed circle would be broken; and, in spite\nof the jollity of their little festival, there was a hint of sorrow in\nevery gay young heart.\n\n\"See--there is a great golden palace over there in the sunset,\" said\nWalter, pointing. \"Look at the shining tower--and the crimson banners\nstreaming from them. Perhaps a conqueror is riding home from battle--and\nthey are hanging them out to do honour to him.\"\n\n\"Oh, I wish we had the old days back again,\" exclaimed Jem. \"I'd love to\nbe a soldier--a great, triumphant general. I'd give EVERYTHING to see a\nbig battle.\"\n\nWell, Jem was to be a soldier and see a greater battle than had ever\nbeen fought in the world; but that was as yet far in the future; and the\nmother, whose first-born son he was, was wont to look on her boys and\nthank God that the \"brave days of old,\" which Jem longed for, were gone\nfor ever, and that never would it be necessary for the sons of Canada to\nride forth to battle \"for the ashes of their fathers and the temples of\ntheir gods.\"\n\nThe shadow of the Great Conflict had not yet made felt any forerunner of\nits chill. The lads who were to fight, and perhaps fall, on the fields\nof France and Flanders, Gallipoli and Palestine, were still roguish\nschoolboys with a fair life in prospect before them: the girls whose\nhearts were to be wrung were yet fair little maidens a-star with hopes\nand dreams.\n\nSlowly the banners of the sunset city gave up their crimson and gold;\nslowly the conqueror's pageant faded out. Twilight crept over the valley\nand the little group grew silent. Walter had been reading again that day\nin his beloved book of myths and he remembered how he had once fancied\nthe Pied Piper coming down the valley on an evening just like this.\n\nHe began to speak dreamily, partly because he wanted to thrill his\ncompanions a little, partly because something apart from him seemed to\nbe speaking through his lips.\n\n\"The Piper is coming nearer,\" he said, \"he is nearer than he was that\nevening I saw him before. His long, shadowy cloak is blowing around\nhim. He pipes--he pipes--and we must follow--Jem and Carl and Jerry and\nI--round and round the world. Listen--listen--can't you hear his wild\nmusic?\"\n\nThe girls shivered.\n\n\"You know you're only pretending,\" protested Mary Vance, \"and I wish you\nwouldn't. You make it too real. I hate that old Piper of yours.\"\n\nBut Jem sprang up with a gay laugh. He stood up on a little hillock,\ntall and splendid, with his open brow and his fearless eyes. There were\nthousands like him all over the land of the maple.\n\n\"Let the Piper come and welcome,\" he cried, waving his hand. \"I'LL\nfollow him gladly round and round the world.\"\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Rainbow Valley, by Lucy Maud Montgomery\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK RAINBOW VALLEY ***\n\n***** This file should be named 5343.txt or 5343.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/5\/3\/4\/5343\/\n\nProduced by Bernard J.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1204,"split":"test"}
